ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analysis of the human genome revealed that the amount
of transcribed sequence is an order of magnitude greater than
the number of predicted and well-characterized genes. A sizeable
fraction of these transcripts is related to alternatively spliced forms
of known protein coding genes. Inspection of the alternatively spliced
transcripts identified in the pilot phase of the ENCODE project
has clearly shown that often their structure might substantially
differ from that of other isoforms of the same gene, and therefore
that they might perform unrelated functions, or that they might
even not correspond to a functional protein. Identifying these
cases is obviously relevant for the functional assignment of gene
products and for the interpretation of the effect of variations in the
corresponding proteins.

Results: Here we describe a publicly available tool that, given a
gene or a protein, retrieves and analyses all its annotated isoforms,
provides users with three-dimensional models of the isoform(s)
of his/her interest whenever possible and automatically assesses
whether homology derived structural models correspond to plausible
structures. This information is clearly relevant. When the homology
model of some isoforms of a gene does not seem structurally
plausible, the implications are that either they assume a structure
unrelated to that of the other isoforms of the same gene with
presumably significant functional differences, or do not correspond
to functional products. We provide indications that the second
hypothesis is likely to be true for a substantial fraction of the cases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Determining the identity and function of all the sequence elements
in human DNA is a daunting challenge. The large scale pilot phase of
the ENCODE project (Birney et al., 2007) provided an exhaustive
identiﬁcation and veriﬁcation of functional sequence elements in
a limited region of 1% of the human genome. The computational

analysis of the data revealed several unexpected features of the
genome (Tress et al., 2007). Perhaps the most surprising one was that
many transcribed elements could be neutral elements that serve as a
reservoir for natural selection. Many of these transcripts derive from
alternative splicing events. Their putative products were manually
analysed by the BioSapiens European Consortium (Tress et al.,
2007). The analysis led to the striking conclusion that more than
50% of them might not give rise to proteins structurally and/or
functionally related to the other isoforms of the same genes or be
the result of aberrant splicing events giving rise to non—functional
proteins (Tress et al., 2007).

Indeed, comparison of the putative proteins encoded by the
alternatively spliced transcripts with the main isoform showed
that most of them lacked an active site, key trans—membrane
segments, essential signalling regions and post—transcriptionally
modiﬁed sites. Most importantly, models of their putative three—
dimensional structures did not seem to correspond to plausible folds
(Tress et al., 2007).

This observation was conﬁrmed by Moult and co—workers
(Melamud and Moult, 2009a, b) who, using a completely different
dataset of alternative splicing variants, found that the vast majority
of them resulted in putatively unstable protein conformations.

Recently, some of us manually analysed the putative structures
of isoforms of the human genome, the existence of which had
been conﬁrmed by mass—spectrometry and of isoforms of the same
genes for which no evidence exists in proteomic databases reaching
essentially the same conclusions (Leoni et al., 2011).

Altogether these observations suggest that we might be observing
the effects of noisy selection of splice sites by the splicing machinery
and/or that alternatively spliced products of a gene might assume
unrelated conformations.

These ﬁndings raise several interesting questions, but also a few
practical issues. First of all, the careful manual analysis performed by
the BioSapiens consortium on 1% of the genome needs to be scaled
up to the whole genome and therefore automated. Secondly, analysis
tools should be available to biologists performing experiments in a
user—friendly manner.

At present, there are a few systems that partially satisfy this need.
For example, the ProSas database (Birzele et al., 2008) (http://
www.bio.iﬁ.lmu.de//forschung/structural—bioinformatics/prosas)
stores structures and models (provided the target proteins shares
at least 40% sequence identity with a known template) for the
alternative isoforms annotated in Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2002)

and Swiss—Prot (Bairoch et al., 2004) and allows the visualization
of the exon boundaries in the context of the three—dimensional
structures, but there is no provision for automatic analysis of the
plausibility or completeness of the resulting structures and models.
The same is true for AS—ALPS (Shionyu et al., 2009) (http://as—
alps.nagahama—i—bio.ac.jp/), a server that provides information
about the putative effect of alternative splicing on human and
mouse proteins, provided that at least one of the isoforms has an
experimentally solved structure.

Here, we describe a system named Modelling and Assessment of
ISoforms Through Automated Server (MAISTAS) that, given the
accession codes of one or more genes or proteins, collects all their
putative spliced isoforms annotated in the Ensembl genome database
(Hubbard et al., 2002), builds, whenever possible, comparative
models for their structures, analyses their features and provides an
estimate of the likelihood that the isoforms correspond to potentially
stable and structurally plausible proteins in the absence of major
conformational rearrangements.

Alternative splicing isoforms can also be uploaded in the
FASTA format in order to allow the user to analyse data
from more comprehensive and specialized databases such
as Aceview (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/IEB/Research/Acemblyl)
(Thierry—Mieg and Thierry—Mieg, 2006) or ASPicDB (http://t.caspur
.it/ASPicDBl) (Martelli et al., 2010).

Model assessment is performed by analysing the quality of the
packing in the core of the structure and/or model, the extent of
exposed hydrophobic surface and the putative effect of deletions
and insertions. These properties are compared to those observed in
known protein structures and in the closest homologs of the known
structure. The system is freely available as a Web server.

2 METHODS

The input data can be a set of sequences in the FASTA format or one
or more of the following codes: Ensembl Gene ID(s), Ensembl Transcript
ID(s), Ensembl protein ID(s) (Flicek et al.), EMBL ID(s) (Leinonen et 01.,
2011), EntrezGene ID(s) (Maglott et 01., 2011), GO ID(s) (Ashbumer
et al., 2000), HGNC automatic gene name, HGNC curated gene name
(Seal et al., 2011), UniProt/TrEMBLAccession(s), UniProt/Swissprot ID(s),
UniProt/Swissprot Accession(s) (The Uniprot Consortium, 2008), VEGA
transcript ID(s), HAVANA transcript ID(s) (Wilming et 61]., 2008).

The collection of all putative splicing isoforms corresponding to the input
gene (or to the gene encoding for the protein when a protein accession code
is used) is achieved by taking advantage of a locally stored version of the
Ensembl database (release 58) (Flicek et al., 2011). Users can select accession
codes for more than 30 different organisms.

The HHsearch 1.1.5 (deing, 2005) is used to search for possible structural
templates (E—value lower than 10—5, sequence coverage of at least 90%,
global alignment mode, all other parameters set at their default values) and
for obtaining the sequence alignment between the target and its templates.
Model building is performed using a local version of Modeller9v8 (Sali and
Blundell, 1993) (default parameters).

The selected parameters ensure that the quality of the produced models is
sufﬁciently high to be able to reliably measure properties described below
as demonstrated by the last CASP experiment (http://predictioncenter.org/
CASP9).

POPS (Cavallo et al., 2003) is used to calculate the accessibility to
the solvent of each residue of the models. The OS software (Pattabiraman
et al., 1995; Fleming and Richards, 2000) is used for computing infrequent
environment of residues. Finally, the ‘packing—eff’ method from the

NUCPROT package (Voss and Gerstein, 2005) is used for estimating how
well packed the protein is.

The thresholds for POPS, Packing—eff and OS tools were derived
by running the programs on 7908 monomeric proteins solved by X—ray
crystallography at a resolution better than 2.5 A. The chosen thresholds,
20.1 for POPS values, 17.8% for Packing—eff values and 0.54 for OS values,
correspond to two standard deviations from the average (data not shown).

Residues are considered exposed if their mean solvent accessibility—
calculated considering three residues on each side of them—is larger than
5 A2.

The average response time for a typical request (three to four isoforms,
a few hundreds amino acid long) is <1 h, the time limiting factor being
the construction of the HMMs and of the corresponding models. The entire
pipeline was built using python scripts and the interface is PHP based.

In order to verify that the system can be applied to a substantial fraction
of cases and that is able to recognize translated proteins, we ran it on
protein isoforms whose existence is unambiguously identiﬁed by mass
spectrometry. We used the May 2010 human build (http://www.peptideatlas
.org/builds/human/201005/APD_Hs_all.fasta) containing 72 396 different
peptides ranging in size from 6 to 66 (mean 17) (Deutsch et al., 2008). Of
these, 19513 could be unambiguously mapped to 2972 isoform products
annotated in Ensembl (release 58). We also compared the results of
MAISTAS with those obtained by a manual analysis of human transcript
products described in Leoni et a]. (2011).

3 RESULTS

The automatic analysis performed by MAISTAS requires that the
user inputs one or more protein/gene accession codes from the
common public databases (see Section 2) or a set of sequences
in the FASTA format. In all but the last case, the sequence(s)
corresponding to the user query is retrieved and mapped back to
the appropriate genome database by using a local installation of
the BioMart database (Durinck et al., 2005). The peptide sequences
of all isoforms of the target gene, as annotated in Ensembl, are
retrieved.

If the input is a set of amino acid sequences in the FASTA format,
they are assumed to be different isoforms of the same gene.

The user can supply an email address (optional) to which the
results will be sent or bookmark the result page. The initial query
page of MAISTAS provides a link to an example result page, which
allows the user to inspect a typical output (Fig. 1).

In the ﬁrst step, the tool evaluates whether a structure exists
for any of the isoforms or, lacking this, whether a comparative
model can be built. In the latter case, the template is identiﬁed
using the HHsearch program, which builds a Hidden Markov Model
(HMM) of the target protein family and compares it to the HMMs
representing a set of non—redundant families of proteins of known
structure (sequence identity between any pair below 70%). This
strategy has been shown in blind tests to be one of the most sensitive
for ﬁnding structural templates (Battey et al., 2007).

The target sequence, the template(s) and the alignment obtained
by the HHsearch are automatically analysed. Only models based
on template structures solved by X—ray crystallography or an NMR
are considered. They are inspected to detect any possible gaps in
the coordinate set (for example, because of the absence of electron
density in X—ray structures). If these regions are present at the N— or
C—terminus of the protein they are trimmed, otherwise a warning is
issued. A warning is also issued if the alignment includes insertions
larger than 50 residues that might correspond to an inserted domain
or deletions larger than 20 residues.

Fig. 1. Snapshots of the MAISTAS output page. (A) Summary table for
the modelled isoforms. The following data are shown: gene ID (gene
identiﬁcation code), isoform ID (isoform identiﬁcation code), isoform
length (number of residues of each isoform), ﬁrst aa, last aa (the ﬁrst
and last modelled or solved amino acid), template ID (the PDB code of
the template protein used for modelling or the PDB code of the known
isoform structure), isoform/template % seq. ID (sequence identity between
the splicing isoform and the sequence of the selected template), fraction of
isoform modelled (percentage of the splicing isoform sequence modelled),
summary (assessment of the plausibility of the structure). (B) Snapshot
of the isoform section showing results of the analysis for each isoform,
its ﬁnal assessment and the modelled structure in a small Jmol window.
Different links in the section allow the user to download the coordinates
of the model, view their 3D structure with regions corresponding to exons
in different colours, view the amino acid sequence and the isoform/template
alignment generated by the HHsearch. (C) Alternative spliced isoform three—
dimensional structures are displayed in separate windows allowing their
simultaneous analysis and comparison. On the right side of each Jmol
window, the user can choose which exons should be displayed and select
different representation modes. By default, all exons are mapped on the
protein structure, each in a different colour. (D) Multiple sequence alignment
of the isoforms displayed via the JALVIEW applet.

The alignment is used to build the model using a local installation
of Modeller (Sali and Blundell, 1993). Once the model has been
built, the system computes the model hydrophobic solvent accessible
area and packing efﬁciency.

If the modelled isoform presents deletions with respect to the
template, the Euclidean distance between the C01 residues before
and after the deletion(s) is recorded. If insertions are present, the
surface exposed to the solvent of the amino acids surrounding them
and the number of inserted amino acids is computed.

The tool informs the user that the model might not correspond
to a complete or plausible structure if the distance between the two
residues on either side of a deletion is >15 A and/or if there are more
than three residues inserted in the core of the protein and/or if the
hydrophobic solvent accessible area of the model is larger than a
set threshold (see Section 2). In assessing the results, the system
takes into account the corresponding values for the template used
for modelling.

The output of MAISTAS is shown in Figure l and includes a
summary table, where all the data regarding the modelled isoforms
are reported. These can also be downloaded as a csv ﬁle. The user
can download the coordinates of all the models and, if desired, all
the intermediate data used in the procedure. The next section of the
output page describes the detailed results for each modelled isoform
and reports (see Section 2 for details):

0 The sequence identity and coverage of the template and its PDB
code.

0 The packing efﬁciency of the model and of its template together
with their comparison with the expected value.

0 The extent of the exposed hydrophobic area of the model and of
its template together with their comparison with the expected
value.

0 The packing environment of residues in the model and the
template together with their comparison with the expected
value.

0 The assessment of whether insertions and deletions (if any) can
be easily accommodated into the model.

0 The modelled or experimental structure in a Jmol window.

0 The option to inspect the multiple sequence alignment via a
JALVIEW applet (Waterhouse et al., 2009).

0 The option to visualize and analyse the models via a Jmol applet
(http://www. j mol.org/ ).

0 A ﬁnal remark about the plausibility/completeness of the
predicted structure.

MAISTAS depends on the availability of structural templates
to predict the three—dimensional structure of the isoforms by
comparative modelling. If no structural templates are available, a
‘No template satisfying all parameters’ warning is issued. When
MAISTAS is unable to provide a reasonable structural model (e. g.
when very large insertions are present) the system will return the
message ‘Maistas is having trouble modelling or assessing this
isoform’.

The online result pages are accessible via the URL sent either
by e—mail or via the ‘Retrieve results by job identiﬁer or by email’
window, using the provided job identiﬁcation code or the e—mail

Produced models and the results of their analysis are stored in
a local database unless the user requests them to be kept private.
This implies that a user might be able to immediately retrieve the
results on the gene(s) of interest if they were already been produced
in a previous run of the system. The entries of the database are time
stamped and presented to the user together with an option to repeat
the analysis, which is advisable if major updates of the genome or
structure database have taken place since the previous analysis was
performed.

We ran the system on all human alternatively spliced isoform
whose existence at the protein level could be unambiguously veriﬁed
by mass spectrometry, i.e. of those protein isoforms for which a
peptide that unambiguously identiﬁes them has been detected with
high reliability by mass spectrometry.

The server was able to produce and analyse models in 30% of the
cases (890 out of 2972). In 2082 of them (70%), the model could not
be built because there is no template satisfying all parameters. This
had to be expected since we use rather stringent parameters to select
the template (E —value better than 10—5, template coverage >90%,
X—ray resolution <2.5 A or solved by the NMR). Out of the modelled
isoforms, 712 (80%) were assessed as structurally plausible (see
http://www.bioinformatica.crs4.org/maistas/pub/dataset.xls). In the
majority of the remaining cases, (160 out of 178) the model showed
a large hydrophobic surface exposed to the solvent. In these cases,
the protein might indeed represent an incomplete and therefore not
plausible structure, but also simply be a subunit of a larger complex.

We compared the results obtained by MAISTAS with those
derived from a manual analysis of the isoforms of genes for
which at least one isoform had been detected in mass—spectrometry
experiments [and unambiguously identiﬁed by the presence of a
peptide in the PeptideAtlas database (Deutsch et al., 2008) and
at least one had not (Leoni et al., 2011)]. The results obtained
automatically using MAISTAS are consistent with those reported
in Leoni et al. (2011). In particular, MAISTAS was able to model
30% of the 555 proteins for which there is an evidence of translation
(to be compared with the 26.4% obtained in the manual analysis),
85% of which were assessed as structurally plausible. The difference
in coverage between the manual and automatic analyses is due to
the increased size of the protein sequence and structure databases.
Models were also produced for 181 out of 555 isoforms for which
there is no evidence of translation in PeptideAtlas. Only 44% of
these isoforms were reported as complete and plausible by the
automatic pipeline. The corresponding numbers for manual analysis
are 145 isoforms (26%) modelled and 48% classiﬁed as structurally
consistent.

3.1 Application example

As an example of the use of MAISTAS, we describe the results
obtained using the gene coding as input for the voltage—dependent
anion channel 3 (VDAC3) (Ensembl gene identiﬁcation code:
ENSG00000078668), a protein that forms a channel through
the mitochondrial outer membrane allowing diffusion of small
hydrophilic molecules. Six splice variants are present in the
Ensembl database for the gene encoding the protein, identiﬁed
by the following Ensembl peptide codes: ENSP00000428845,
ENSP00000022615, ENSP00000428519, ENSP00000428977,
ENSP00000429006 and ENSP00000428029.

The UniProt database entry of VDAC3 (Q9Y277)
describes only two of these isoforms (ENSP00000388732

 

Fig. 2. Three—dimensional models of the VDAC3 protein isoforms.

and ENSP00000022615). Although four peptides mapping to
the putative products are present in the PeptideAtlas database
(PeptideAtlas IDs: PAp00006999; PAp00007806; PAp00077146;
and PAp00423732), they cannot be used to unambiguous identify
speciﬁc isoforms of the gene since they fall in the exons present in
all of them.

Decker et al. (Decker and Craigen, 2000) used speciﬁc
anti—VDAC3 antibody and demonstrated the existence of the
ENSP00000428845 and ENSP00000022615 isoforms. The only
difference between these two alternatively spliced isoforms is
the insertion of a single methionine at position 39 of the
ENSP00000428845 sequence.

ENSP00000022615 is also annotated in the CCDS database,
a resource that centralizes the identiﬁcation of well—supported,
consistently annotated, protein—coding regions (Pruitt et al., 2009).
MAISTAS was able to provide a plausible structural model for
isoforms ENSP00000428845 and ENSP00000022615 (Fig. 2A
and F), while models of ENSP00000428519, ENSP00000428977,
ENSP00000429006 and ENSP00000428029 were considered
unlikely or incomplete (Fig. 2B—E). Inspection of the
HHpred alignment used for building the ENSP00000428519,
ENSP00000428977, ENSP00000429006 and ENSP00000428029
isoform models does not highlight any speciﬁc problem with the
alignment (data not shown); however, the VDAC3 beta—barrel
domain architecture is completely disrupted in the models of
ENSP00000428519, ENSP00000428977, ENSP00000429006 and

MAISTAS: modelling of alternative splicing isoforms

 

ENSP00000428029 (Fig. 2B—E). All these isoforms show a large
exposed hydrophobic surface, (around 22 A2, compared with the
expected value of 15.6 A2 and with the value observed for the
template of 15.9 A2). This dramatic architecture variation might
imply that the isoforms are non—functional or that they perform a
completely different function.

4 CONCLUSION

The more detailed is the analysis of the genomes of higher
eukaryotes, the more complex they are revealed to be. For example,
it is becoming clear that alternative splicing events do not simply
result in a modulation of the function of the gene products, for
example, by removing or adding structurally compact domains, or by
modifying the sequence of speciﬁc regions of the encoded protein,
but that they can either have a profound effect on the structure and
function of the products of the same gene or give raise to non—
functional products (Melamud and Moult, 2009a, b; Tress et al,
2007).

The latter can nevertheless have a relevant biological function.
For example, Poliseno et al. demonstrated that transcripts may also
function by competing for microRNA binding, a biological activity
independent of the translation of the protein they encode (Poliseno
et al, 2010). It is impossible for any currently available method,
including ours, to assess which is the case.

The method described here is able to correctly classify as plausible
a large fraction of the experimentally characterized isoforms, and
to highlight dubious cases. Our aim is to provide easy access to
a computational tool able to draw the attention of the life science
community to them. Consequently, we took special care to convey
the results of the analysis, although based on rather sophisticated
tools, in an easy and understandable fashion. MAISTAS provides
access to all the intermediate data used to generate the results,
but it describes them in a human readable form. We believe that
MAISTAS represents a step in the direction of using the knowledge
accumulated in structural bioinformatics as well as the maturity of
the tools available for applications related to the interpretation of
genomic data and that it can be effectively used as a ﬁrst step
in characterizing novel proteins as well as a support for selecting
interesting and intriguing cases for structural and functional studies.

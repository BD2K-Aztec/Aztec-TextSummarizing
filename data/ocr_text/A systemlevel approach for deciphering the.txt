ABSTRACT

Motivation: Deciphering the response of a complex biological
system to an insulting event, at the gene expression level, requires
adopting theoretical models that are more sophisticated than a one-
to-one comparison (Le. t-test). Here, we investigate the ability of a
novel reverse engineering approach (System Response Inference) to
unveil non-obvious transcriptional signatures of the system response
induced by prion infection.

Results: To this end, we analyze previously published gene
expression data, from which we extrapolate a putative full-scale
model of transcriptional gene—gene dependencies in the mouse
central nervous system. Then, we use this nominal model to interpret
the gene expression changes caused by prion replication, aiming
at selecting the genes primarily influenced by this perturbation. Our
method sheds light on the mode of action of prions by identifying key
transcripts that are the most likely to be responsible for the overall
transcriptional rearrangement from a nominal regulatory network.
As a first result of our inference, we have been able to predict
known targets of prions (i.e. PrPC) and to unveil the potential role
of previously unsuspected genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge in Systems Biology is to provide a global
and quantitative understanding of complex diseases by means
of high—throughput technologies. In a system—level approach, the
synergistic response dictated by the cooperation and interplay
of all the components within an organism is considered as a
fundamental concept in the interpretation of ‘omics’ data. Recent
efforts employ model—driven analysis and transcriptomic data
for studying neurodegenerative diseases (Benetti et al., 2010).
However, while DNA microarrays have been extensively used to
comprehensively characterize the differentially expressed genes
(DEGs), the application of more sophisticated models, working
beyond simple differential expression detection, is still an open

challenge (Fig. 1). To this end, the ability of reverse engineering
algorithms to infer putative gene—gene interactions, functional
relationships and genome—scale regulatory networks has been
already proven to be successful (Faith et al., 2007; Gardner et al.,
2003). Although the applications to multicellular organisms are still
sporadic, this class of algorithms represents a promising approach
toward genome—wide studies of complex diseases (Basso et al.,
2005; Wang et al., 2009). Our aim in this article is to propose a novel
reverse engineering strategy in order to investigate transcriptional
changes induced by prion propagation in mouse models.

Among the various neurodegenerative disorders, prion diseases
have captured the attention of the scientiﬁc community due to
their infectious nature and transmissibility (Prusiner, 1982). The
cellular form of the prion protein (PrPC) is the substrate for an
autocatalytic reaction that, through its recruitment and modiﬁcation,
acts in the propagation of a disease—causing form denominated
PrPSC or prion. This autocatalytic process leads to the formation
of ﬁbrils and amyloid deposits, and is associated to a progressive
fatal damage of the brain tissue. Importantly, experimental evidence
has demonstrated that PrP knockout and PrP anchorless (Chesebro
et al., 2005) mice are resistant to infection. In spite of the many
approaches aimed at unveiling its physiological functions, the degree
of overlap between the pathogenic dysfunction of the protein in prion
diseases and its normal role is still largely unknown [for a review
see Aguzzi et al. (2008)]. In such a complicated ‘puzzle’, it is widely
accepted that since PrPC is a key mediator for the neurotoxicity of
PrPSC, studying its biological functions through the identiﬁcation of
its related molecular partners may help unraveling the mechanisms
underling prion—dependent neurodegeneration.

In light of this observation, we integrate here a recently
published transcriptional dataset (Hwang et al., 2009), monitoring
prion propagation in mouse brain tissues, with independent gene
expression experiments performed under many diverse conditions.
The computational framework introduced in this article aims at
deciphering transcriptional variations in the context of a system—
wide regulatory network, moving from a single gene perspective
to a system—level analysis (Fig.1). The procedure is composed of
three steps. In the ﬁrst step, using a compendium of gene expression
measurements, we obtain a genome—scale interaction graph of the
mouse brain. Then, in a second step, we reﬁne the initial model via
a multiple regression scheme. In the third step, this linear regressive
model is used to investigate expression changes associated to Prion
infection, where for each gene we estimate the inﬂuence of prion

Fig. 1. System response inference: a toy genetic network consisting of six
genes exempliﬁes the advantages of using a system—level data comparison
(a). Standard statistical tests (i.e. t—test) unveil signiﬁcant fold change in
gene expression variations for each transcript individually (b), neglecting
the underlying regulatory network. Such statistical test can identify whether
the expression level of a transcript is signiﬁcantly changed with respect to
a reference. Putative gene expression changes are reported in panel (c). In
this speciﬁc example, two genes are identiﬁed to be overexpressed [red/+
nodes] and one downregulated (green/— node), while the remaining three do
not show any changes (grey nodes). By knowing the corresponding genetic
regulatory network ((1), we can discriminate the coherent variations from the
unexpected ones. As shown in the example, two of the genes that showed
a signiﬁcant expression variations are consistent with model predictions i.e.
the expression changes of genes x and y can be explained by the variation of
gene z. This is reﬂected by a skew distribution of discrepancies (i.e. residues),
between model predictions and observed data, centered around 0 (1'). At the
same time, one transcript, w, is not responding coherently to the initial model.
The fact that its expression is unchanged, when it should have been increased,
might relate to an anomalous direct effect of the pathology, preventing a
synergistic response between all the genes in the system. Hence, the list of
‘perturbed genes’ can be sensibly different from the standard DEGs identiﬁed
from individual fold change analysis (b/e).

propagation on its transcriptional regulation. In other words, we
systematically identify the genes that result ‘perturbed’ with respect
to the nominal model by a prion infection. A remarkable outcome
of our network—based strategy is the ability to identify PrPC among
the predicted prion targets, in agreement with its role of primary
substrate for prion replication. This result is even more important if
we consider that to our knowledge prion infection has never been
noted to interfere with the transcriptional regulation of the Pmp
gene. Moreover, the comparison between the PrPC partners inferred
on the nominal model and the PrPSC targets predicted from the
perturbed model allows to estimate the signiﬁcance of the overlap
between the two.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data collected

For Mus Musculus, we compiled a collection of microarrays (XTraining)
containing experiments performed with Affymetrix chips (1366 experiments
Affymetrix Mouse Genome 430 2.0), selecting Gene Expression Ominibus
(GEO) experiments performed on brain tissue. Probe set intensities referring
to a common gene were averaged, and only genes with a corresponding
orthologous gene in Human were retained (for a total of 13 204 genes).
Identical procedure was followed to collect a dataset of gene expression

proﬁles for Human (Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) and
Rat (Affymetrix Rat Genome 230 2.0 Array). See Supplementary Table SI
for the list of GEO codes. All datasets were preprocessed and normalized
prior to network inference. Protein Complex network for human, rat and
mouse were downloaded from the CORUM database (Ruepp et al., 2010),
whereas PPIs from the MppDB website (Li et al., 2009).

2.2 SR1 procedure

In this section, we describe the method used for reverse engineering
large—scale gene—gene transcriptional dependencies and predicting systemic
changes induced by a perturbing event (i.e. prions). This framework is
inspired by the works of Bansal et al. (2006); di Bernardo et al. (2005);
Gardner et al. (2003). In order to perform a truly systems—level analysis of
gene expression proﬁles, we ﬁrst seek for signiﬁcant transcriptional inter—
dependencies by means of a relevance network approach (Step I). We then
use this relevance network to identify a nominal model based on a linear
ODE description (Step II). Finally, the inferred model is used to detect gene
expression changes caused by prion infection or Prnp deletion incompatible
with the model (Step III).

Step I : Relevance network algorithms have the remarkable advantage of
being computationally feasible for genome—wide applications (Basso et al.,
2005; Faith et al., 2007). This class of methods assumes that gene—gene
interactions can be identiﬁed by determining the gene pairs possessing
the highest expression similarity over multiple conditions. A square matrix
(n x n, where n is the number of genes) of pairwise Pearson’s correlations
between gene expression patterns is computed. The (unsigned) absolute
values of Pearson’s correlation between gene i and j is:

E[(xi —3Ci)(xj —5Cj)]

Ci- 2
J Viv]-

, (1)

 

 

where x,- is the expression vector for gene i (i.e. m gene expression
measurements made under diverse conditions) and xj is the expression vector
for gene j . In Equation (1) 3c), v,- and 39-, vj are means and variances ofxl- and xj
over the m experiments and E H denotes expectation. Each row/column of C
(i.e. Ci ) can be considered as a distribution of pairwise similarity coefﬁcients
between a gene (i.e. i) and all the others. This distribution can be transformed
in the corresponding vector of rankings, from 1 to n (W’). As a consequence
of this transformation, the correlation between i and j is associated to two
‘ranking values’. Denote Wi (j) and Wj (i) the rank of Ci]- with respect to Ci
and C, respectively. Genes (i and j) are considered as putative interactors if
and only if both their ranking indexes (Wi(j) and Wj (i)) are above a certain
common threshold 6 [Equation (2)]. A graph of putative interactions, GR, is
obtained by the following relationship:

(i,j)eGR<=>Wi(i)29&Wj(i):6. (2)

Step II: for each gene i, we assume that the change in concentration
can be expressed as a linear combination of the concentrations of
interacting genes [i.e. xj such that (i, j)eGR], plus possibly an additive
external stimulus/perturbation [Equation (3)]. This external input can be an
environmental change (i.e. nutrient viability), a genetic perturbation (i.e.
overexpression/deletion) or a toxic compound able to perturb the system
(i.e. drive the system to a new steady state). Similar to Gardner et al.
(2003), the responses of the system to the various perturbations can be
formalized as a system of linear differential equations (ODEs) in which
the input vector ii: [u1, ...,up] is modeled as a linear combination of the
external perturbations ii,-

A system-level approach to prion infection

 

(pX 1) identical to 1. The n x p input matrix B collects the inﬂuences of
the external perturbations ii on each single gene. The k—th column of B
indicates how effective/intense the k—th perturbation uk is on the state vector
x (di Bernardo et al., 2005). Under steady state conditions, the variation in
time of the mRNA concentration is by deﬁnition equal to zero. In this case,
Equation (4) becomes a simpler system of algebraic equations:

Ax +Bu = 0. (5)

In order to estimate the parameters of the model, we employ a large
compendium of gene expression proﬁles (XTraining), containing many
different external perturbations, none of them is related to prion infection. In
Equation (5), we assume that the matrix A stays constant over all the different
experimental conditions, and that the columns of B are sparse (i.e. few non—
zero elements). This last assumption reﬂects that the different perturbations
collected in the dataset are likely to affect just a small portion of genes, if
compared with the entire genome. This is justiﬁed for example in case of
mutants, where a speciﬁc gene has been knocked out. By collecting a vast
selection of different experimental conditions (i.e. >1300 chips), we aim
at avoiding that particular perturbations are overrepresented in the dataset,
hence that the assumption of sparsity does not hold for some of the rows of B.
Therefore, for each transcript, expression changes caused by the direct effect
of an external stimulus are likely to occur just in few of the experimental
conditions of the training dataset, and to be ‘uniformly’ distributed over
the rows of B (i.e. different perturbations do not act always on the same
transcripts). Under these assumptions, the contribution of B is marginal, and
sufﬁciently accurate estimation of the non—zero terms of the A matrix (Clij)
can still be drawn from the following approximation:

Ax% 0. (6)

Similar arguments are used in most reverse engineering algorithms, see e. g.
in (Cosgrove et al., 2008). A multiple regression framework is here used
to learn the network coefﬁcients al-j from the training dataset XTraining. This
framework seeks for the solutions which minimize the L2 norm between the
predictions of the model and the experimental values of XTraining. For each
gene, the result is the following vector of coefﬁcients:

A _ . . aij . 2
aci—argmln “961— ijll (7)
a (iaj)€AI ll

where x,- is a vector of gene expression measurements of gene i (i.e. row
of XTraining). The solution of Equation 7 is correct up to an undetermined
scaling factor (the diagonal term Clil‘) by which we rescale each row of A.
The outcome of the n regression problems is a weighted asymmetric matrix
AC and, for each gene i, a vector of residues (r1), resulting from the difference
between observed and predicted values.

Selection of 6: In order to avoid an arbitrary selection of the cut—off
parameter 6 in Equation (2), we adopt a Bayesian Information Criterion
(BIC). Since an increase in the number of free parameters in Equation
(7) always reduces the absolute sum of residuals (r), we search for the
best compromise between the model complexity, in terms of the number
of parameters (i.e. non zero entries in the connectivity map GR) and
ﬁtness quality (i.e. discrepancies between predicted and observed values).
Therefore, we ﬁtted multiple models corresponding to different choices of
6 in Equation (2) and estimated the corresponding ﬁtness qualities via the
BIC. The BIC, Equation (8), is the most common criterion for the ﬁtness
of a mathematical model to observed data, leaning more toward lower
dimensional models (i.e. sparse matrices)

RSSi
BICi=m|:ln(7):| +ln(m)K,- (8)

where K,- is the number of parameters in the model for gene i (i.e. number
of edges of i) and RSS,- the residual sum of squares (2:121:33). The value of

6 corresponding to the minimum of the mean of BIC,- indexes (0) is selected

for the ﬁnal step of the analysis [Equation (2)]:

fl
(9: argmin (231a) (9)
9 i=1
The identiﬁcation of the graph GR is the most underdeterrnined step of the
reverse engineering approach. However, coherently with Bansal et al. (2006),
we found that small changes of 6 do not drastically change the structure of
AC and its numerical entities.

Step III: the resulting AC model is used to predict the expression proﬁles
associated to a new condition, here denoted as Xprion [in our case, the
dataset published in Hwang et al., (2009)]. The procedure is to search for
the genes for which the nominal model AC is incorrectly describing the
expression changes in the new experimental condition. The dataset Xprion
contains perturbative effects induced exclusively by prion propagation or
Prnp absence: prion infection (143 experiments/columns in Xprion), Prnp
deletion (22 experiments) and both perturbations at the same time (27
experiments). According to Equation (6), we expect that if gene i is not
directly inﬂuenced by these external agents, then its expression changes
should be correctly predicted by the nominal model (1.6.ACXPri0n @0). This
should be reﬂected in a skewed distribution of residues around 0 (named
rprion). On the contrary, whenever gene i is directly inﬂuenced by a prion—
related external stimulus we expect the initial model to be ineffective in
predicting gene expression variations. This indicates that the equation should
be corrected as Acxpﬁon +BprionI/lprion = 0. Non—zero entries in the i—th row of
Bpri0n unveil the input ‘pathway’ of the prion—related perturbation. For each
gene i, we test this hypothesis by comparing the discrepancies that follow
if we impose Acxprionl. % 0 (i.e. rpm-0m.) with those obtained during the ﬁtting
procedure of Step II (r1), through a two—sample t—test [Equation (10)] (Fig. 2):

r i _7Pri0n-
ti = —’ (10)
2 s2
M rPrionl-
mt mPrionl-

where T,- and 713mm are the mean of the residues in the training and the ‘prion—
speciﬁc’ dataset for gene i and sri, srm” are the corresponding SDs. Using
the Student’s t—probability distributionja statistical signiﬁcance (P—value)
is assigned to each gene. Once the distribution of analytical P—values has
been generated, the q—value is used to correct the measure of signiﬁcance for
multiple testings (Storey, 2002). When the two distributions of residues are
signiﬁcantly different, the gene i is considered to be a target of the applied
perturbation.

3 RESULTS

In a recent work (Hwang et al., 2009), more than 400 DNA chips
were collected, monitoring the transcriptional changes associated to
various disease stages, prion strains and mice backgrounds. The
authors interpreted differentially regulated genes in light of the
known network of protein—protein interactions and hypothesized
a speciﬁc temporal order of the biological processes involved. In
our study, the same dataset of Hwang et al. (2009) is integrated
with a large compendium (i.e. 1366 Affymetrix experiments) of
gene expression measurements associated to various conditions.
We ﬁrst trained a gene network model (AC, see Section 2) on
this large compendium. Next, on the background of this initial
network, we evaluated the impact of an independent dataset (Hwang
et al., 2009) containing gene expression variations caused by a
perturbing event, that can be either an external agent (i.e. prion
inoculation) or an endogenous perturbation (i.e. Pmp knockout).
In our interaction network, inoculated prions were modeled as
hidden variables/nodes, while a gene knockout was interpreted as
a node deletion (Fig. 3). We then investigated the behavior of the
system upon Prion infection or Pmp deletion with special attention

Fig. 2. Residue distributions: the results obtained for the Prnp gene are
shown as an example. While for the training set (blue) a Gaussian distribution
centered around zero was recovered (in agreement with the expectation of
white noise residues), a heavier tail was emerging when predicting prion—
infected mice measurements (red). The drastic opposite effect is expected
when knocking out the Prnp gene (yellow) or when both perturbations are
applied (light blue). It is worth to stress that the authors of Hwang et al.
(2009) did not ﬁnd any signiﬁcant expression changes in the Prnp gene. This
result was common to all the studies performing gene expression analysis in
prion—infected systems [for a review see Benetti et al. (2010)]. Our outcome
was different from previous studies [such as Hwang et al. (2009)] because
we allowed a gene to be ‘signiﬁcant’ regardless of its individual difference
in expression between infected and normal samples. Rather, systemic gene
expression alterations are here considered and used in order to estimate
the expected expression changes of the singular transcript. In a system—
level response, a global transcriptional rearrangement is expected to counter
balance the new ‘operating point/equilibrium’. If this regulation is not taking
place, or in other words if the gene is not able to properly respond, enhancing
or repressing its transcription, its contribution in the disease progression
should be taken into account as well (Fig. 1). Therefore, our approach can be
considered to be complementary to the analysis performed in Hwang et al.
(2009).

to alterations in the gene expression that could not be explained
by the initial nominal model. Such discrepancies are assumed
to be the consequence of the investigated perturbing events (see
Section 2). This method, called ‘System Response Inference’ (SRI),
is inspired by computational frameworks published in Bansal et al.
(2006); di Bernardo et al. (2005); Gardner et al. (2003). Results
are organized in four subsections. In the ﬁrst, we investigate the
inferred co—expressed partners of PmP. In the next two subsections,
we analyze and interpret the data of Hwang et al. (2009). SRI
predictions for putative PrPC buffering genes and PrPSC targets
are analyzed and the differences emerging from our system—level
approach with respect to the results in Hwang et al. (2009) are
discussed. Subsequently, we consulted a drug database in search
for druggable targets among the ﬁrst neighbors identiﬁed in the
extrapolated network for PrPs. Finally, an analysis performed across
human, mouse and rat samples revealed co—expression patterns that
were highly conserved across these species.

3.1 Prion protein co-expressed partners

By applying SRI to the collected gene expression database on
mouse brain tissue samples (see Supplementary Table Sl for GEO
codes), we ﬁrst identiﬁed 450 signiﬁcantly Prnp—related genes, of
which 37 were anticorrelated (see Supplementary Table S2—partners
and Fig. 3a). As we have already observed in a previous study

to investigate the PrPC functions and PrPSC targets. A large compendium
of gene expression measurements, comprehensive of a variety of different
conditions, is ﬁrst used to extrapolate a weighted network of ‘gene—gene’
interactions (3, PrPC is highlighted in yellow). Nodes represent genes,
whereas edges link ‘interacting’ genes. The rewiring of the network caused
by self—replicating prions (red node, b) or by a deletion of the gene (c) will
render our initial nominal model ineffective for the genes directly linked to
the perturbation. We address this issue comparing the inconsistencies (i.e.
residues) of the model predictions if applied to perturbation—speciﬁc (b—d)

Fig. 4. Network in—silico validation: we assessed the ability to recover
the network of protein—protein interactions (PPI), protein complexes (PCs)
and transcriptional regulation (TF) in three different mammals (mouse,
rat and human, see Section 2). We evaluated the overlap between
the inferred networks (dashed red lines in the toy network) with the
known networks (solid black lines) by computing the relative sensitivity
index (W). The histogram shows that even in such
underdeterrnined conditions (ratio experiments/genes ~01), a reverse
engineering approach on a multicellular system may extrapolate meaningful
information.

(Zampieri et al., 2008) for unicellular prokaryotes and eukaryotes
(i.e. Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces cerevisiae), the strongest
source of co—expression was the co—participation of gene products
in the same protein complex (Fig. 4). This observation reﬂects the
tendency to establish ‘stable—bindings’ between gene products of the
inferred interacting gene pairs. Indeed, many predictions were in
agreement with previous experimental studies seeking for proteins
capable of binding PrPC such as Cltc, Gpm6a, Gpm6b (Rutishauser
et al., 2009), Lsamp, SparcLl (Schmitt—Ulms et al., 2004), Ywhag,
Ywhah and Gnaol (Watts et al., 2009) or to co—localize with prion
(i.e. ApoE) (Nakamura et al., 2000) (see Supplementary Material for
further discussion). In addition, Aplpl, the precursor—like amyloid
protein, has been identiﬁed, in association with App, as a probable
ligand of PrP (Yehiely et al., 1997). Such prediction was supported
by their similar proteolytic processing and ability to bind copper

and, in case of Aplpl, to inhibit the cleavage of App by ,8—secretase
(Bacel). It is worth noting the connection with Apbbl, thought to
modulate the internalization of ,B—amyloid precursor protein and
Rtn3, also inhibiting Bacel activity. Furthermore, synaptojaninl
(Synjl), the major inositol 5—phosphatase (jointly with Pitpna and
Cadps) is known to reduce the levels of cellular PIP2 and it
has been shown to have an important impact in determining the
level of A,842 (Berman et al., 2008). The co—regulation with Rtn4,
which reduces the anti—apoptotic activity of Bcl—xl and Bcl—2, might
relate to the observed inverse transcriptional proportionality between
Prnp and 361212 (e.g. Casp6, Prdx4), pointing to a role of PrP in
apoptosis (Kim et al., 2004). Btf 3, Cdk2 and Bazla, all involved
in transcriptional regulation, are candidates for inhibiting the Prnp
expression.

By performing an ontology enrichment (Supplementary
Table S3), we identiﬁed some of the biological functions already
associated to PrPC, suggesting the potential molecular partners
responsible for these roles. For instance, the presence of small
GTPase molecules such as Rab proteins might emerge because
of clathrin—mediated endocytosis, reﬂecting their control role in
PrPC trafﬁcking. Furthermore, the enrichment of categories like
Golgi vesicle transport and endocytosis may be related to the
transit of PrPC from the endoplasmic reticulum to the cell surface
through the Golgi apparatus. Several other genes were involved in
nerve impulse transmission, such as again Synaptojanin—l, which
in association with Lrpll, reinforced the evidences that PrPC is
internalized via clathrin—coated vesicles (Taylor and Hooper, 2007).
In parallel, caveolin—mediated signaling (Pantera et al., 2009) (here
represented by Cav2) and the localization of PrPC on membrane
lipid rafts might explain the occurrence of genes related to lipid
transport. In light of the many studies observing behavioral changes
in Prnp knockout mice [i.e. reduced level of anxiety (Nico et al.,
2005)], we highlighted the presence of genes related to anxiety,
such as Gnaol. Impaired hippocampal—dependent spatial learning
was observed in Prnp null—mice as well, supporting the inferred
relationship with chn, required for spatial learning processes
and Cpebl involved in long—term memory (Si et al., 2003a) (see
next section for further discussion). Furthermore, several sources
of experimental evidences have shown the effect of PrP on cell
proliferation and differentiation (Sales et al., 2002) and were here
conﬁrmed by the enriched categories such as the nervous system
development and differentiation (i.e. Ids, responsible for mental
retardation, Trim2 contributing to the alteration of neural cellular
mechanisms, and Neddl). These properties were related to the
activation of PrPC by cAMP and MAP proteins kinases (which
are also identiﬁed as signiﬁcant ontological categories) through
the interaction with Ncam (Santuccione et al., 2005). Our analysis
did not retrieve the Ncam interaction, but identiﬁed a closely
related gene Nrcam, alongside many other cell adhesion molecules.
Furthermore, the role of PrP in synaptic activity, neurotransmission
and neuronal excitability was highlighted by the identiﬁcation of
Synl. The previously observed relationship between PrP and Erk
activity might be just a secondary effect of the relationship here
identiﬁed with Ras signal transduction, MapK, calcium signaling
pathways and PKC signaling (i.e. an2l 1, Prkd3). Furthermore, the
high percentage of genes related to homeostatic processes and ion
transport (i.e. Adamll a metalloprotease, probably reﬂecting the
known interaction with Adma23) indicated a possible involvement
in protection against oxidative stress (i.e. Oxrl) and metal ion

dysmetabolism. Finally, it is interesting to notice that melanogenesis
emerged as a highly signiﬁcant biological pathway (Supplementary
Table S3), hence indicating the possibility for a relationship
between non—pathogenic presence of proteinsase—resistant PrP and
the mechanism of production and formation of melanin (Fowler
et al., 2006).

3.2 PrP knockout compensation

Even if the PrP sequence is very well conserved among mammals,
its ablation in mice results in no clear phenotype, nor is essential
for their survival. This might be due to several reasons, such as
the presence of buffering genes masking the PrPC absence or to
an adaptive process during central nervous system development.
We used the inferred mouse transcriptional gene network model to
interpret the response to a Prnp deletion from the same dataset of
(Hwang et al., 2009) (see Section 2 and Fig. 3c). We immediately
noticed that, as expected, the perturbation intensity, as well as
the Prnp associated q—value, was the lowest (see Supplementary
Table S2, knockout). In addition, 27 genes show an equal incoherent
variation (i.e. q—value=0), which was not predicted by the initial
gene network model. It is worth observing that a simple comparison
of these transcripts with their reference counterparts (i.e. normal
state) does not show any relevant expression changes. Indeed,
in Hwang et al. (2009) no signiﬁcant expression changes were
found in PrP—null mice. This highlights the difference between
our approach and a standard comparative study, emphasizing the
ability of our method to extrapolate non—obvious transcriptional
signatures.

Among these genes, the enriched biological processes were
tRNA metabolism, intracellular transport and synaptic transmission
(Supplementary Table S4). We could observe for example the
presence of Dstn, encoding for an actin—binding protein belonging
to the ADF family responsible for enhancing the turnover rate
of actin. In addition, Gls catalyzes the conversion of glutamate
from glutamine and its potential role for compensating PrP absence
may derive from its implication in behavior disturbances in which
glutamate acts as a neurotransmitter (Prusiner, 1981). Gls is also
involved in Alzheimer, just like Chgb, a tyrosine—sulfated secretory
protein. Given their co—expression patterns with PrPC (see previous
section) and their high signiﬁcance as targets of PrPSC (next section),
Sirpa and Cpeb are of particular interest (see also Supplementary
Fig. S2). The former is a transmembrane glycoprotein receptor
involved in the negative regulation of receptor tyrosine kinases,
being a substrate for tyrosine phosphatases (PTP). This gene may
participate to the signaling cascade involving Fyn (Pantera et al.,
2009) and their concomitant activation with Prnp was observed
in bovine monocytes infected by Theileria (Jensen et al., 2008).
The latter has been recently discovered to be able to aggregate
as a prion—like protein (Heinrich and Lindquist, 2011; Si et al.,
2003b). Additionally, in Si et al. (2003a) the authors showed its
vital role in long—term memory, and it is tempting to speculate that
a similar function may exist for PrP. It is worth noting that both
transcripts are similarly reacting to a Prnp deletion and to prion
infection (Supplementary Table S2), thereby suggesting that in case
of prions replication the system is attempting to compensate for a
lack of PrPC. By comparing the residues in Prnp—null infected mice
with mock—inoculated Prnpo/0 (Fig. 3d), no signiﬁcant genes were
identiﬁed (q < 0.05). This result was consistent with the insensitivity

of prion knockout mice to prion infection and it was in agreement
with the conclusions in Hwang et al. (2009).

3.3 Prion targets

The same procedure has been used to determine the portion of the
inferred network which is most ‘sensitive’ to prion perturbation.
Hence, in order to unveil the nodes (i.e. genes) which are likely
affected by prions, the predictions of the initial model were tested
on the experimental data collected in Hwang et al. (2009) and the
inconsistencies were detected through a rigorous statistical test (see
Section 2 and Fig. 3b). Model—based inference on prion—infected
mice resulted in 3255 genes with an associated q—value lower than
0.01 (see Supplementary Table S2, targets). As already mentioned,
previous results showed that prions bind with high speciﬁcity to
PrPC, and that further effects were mediated by its autocatalytic
recruitment and conversion, although so far, no transcriptional
variations have been extrapolated for the Prnp gene during infection
(Benetti et al., 2010). Notwithstanding these studies, the Prnp gene
was here identiﬁed among the most signiﬁcant prion ‘targets’.
Therefore, as a reference threshold for the q—value signiﬁcance,
we selected the one associated to Prnp (7.12>l<10_9), as we did
previously for the Prnp deletion. This led to the selection of
389 genes (out of the total 13204 considered). In Hwang et al.
(2009), the authors identiﬁed ~7400 DEGs in at least one of the
ﬁve combinations prion—strain/mouse—background, and among these
genes, 333 were identiﬁed in all the combinations. Again, only
a small fraction of genes (i.e. 58) are in common with our list,
mainly those involved in immune system processes (Supplementary
Table S8).

Among the detected prion targets, several were in common with
the previously observed co—expressed partners (Section 2.1) of
the cellular prion form (P: 1.07- 10‘6 hypergeometric test): for
example, Magi2, encoding a protein interacting with Astrophinl
(modulating activin—mediated signaling), Snap25, already detected
in scrapie—infected GT1 cells (Sandberg and Lew, 2005) or
Cntnl, also involved in nervous system development. This in
turn, reinforced the evidences of the central role of PrPC as
a mediator of prion neurotoxicity. Various genes in the list
were involved in apoptosis, inﬂammatory response and leukocyte
activation (Supplementary Table S5). It is not clear what are
the primary damage causes, nor whether such damage is due to
a gain or a loss of PrP functions, but our ﬁndings suggested
apoptosis as a mechanism directly inﬂuenced by prion propagation.
Genes involved in signaling, neurotransmitter transport and integrin—
mediated signaling were perturbed during prion infection, in
agreement with the reduced synaptic neurotransmission and
dysfunction observed during TSE propagation (Ferrer et al., 1999).
In this respect, it has previously been reported that scrapie—infected
mice showed higher Bacel activity, suggesting an impairment of the
regulatory role of PrPC in its modulation. Our results indicated an
unbalanced response of Bace2, which stimulates App processing in a
non—amyloidogenic pathway suppressing the level of AB production,
probably in an attempt to compensate for Bacel dysfunction. It is
also worth noting the Atf6 gene, one of the main stress sensor of the
ER membrane and the related Eif4e, which has been recently found
to potentially play a main role in prion, induced neurodegeneration
(Roffé et al., 2010). In addition, it has been observed that transgenic
mice expressing PrPC deletion mutants, or overexpressing Dpl are

characterized by vacuolation of the myelinated ﬁbers (Bremer et al.,
2010), where PrPC presence was discovered (Radovanovic et al.,
2005), bringing back our analysis to genes involved in myelination
(i.e. Lgi4, Klk6) and the several integrins among the most signiﬁcant
hits (Itgax, Itgb2, Itgb4). The enrichment of genes involved in the
glycan degradation pathway and lipid transport and sequestering
might reﬂect the response of the system in controlling the amount
of PrP on the membrane surface, where its attachment is a necessary
condition for prions to induce neurotoxic signals (Chesebro et al.,
2005). We also noticed the presence of several apolipoproteins, such
as Apocl, shown to play a role in Alzheimer, whereas ApoD and
Apold 1 may play a role in brain vasculature, affecting brain—blood
permeability.

3.4 Druggable targets

Prion molecular targets may pave the way to the development
and identiﬁcation of compounds able to disrupt the mechanism
of action of prion neurotoxicity. By targeting the inferred gene
products, it might be possible to modulate disease progression,
delaying it in time or to interrupt a fundamental neurotoxic chemical
reaction. We consulted a repository database (www.Drugbank.ca)
and linked approved drugs to the genes identiﬁed in our analysis
(Supplementary Table S6). Drugs acting on cholesterol by inhibiting
its biosynthesis, such as statins, have been previously used
(Taraboulos et al., 1995) for the treatment of Prion diseases.
In particular, here we identiﬁed simvastatin (Kempster et al.,
2007) its ability to interact with Itgb2. We also noticed Spermine
(polycataionic compound) and N—Acetyl—D—glucosamine, which
have been shown to prolong the incubation time (Trevitt and
Collinge, 2006). Compounds such as antihemophilic factors,
Tenecteplase and Bevacizumab, are instead acting on the coagulation
process, removal of blood clots and the inhibition of blood vessel
growth, respectively. The second one in particular seems to be a
promising treatment since it prevents the interactions of VEGF with
its receptors. Abnormal regulation of VEGF expression has been
implicated in several neurodegenerative disorders, including Prion
disease (Koperek et al., 2002), where neurodegeneration might be
caused by impairing neural tissue perfusion. Another promising
compound is choline, a major component of the polar head group
of phosphatidylcholine, which plays a vital role in basic biological
processes, including the maintenance of cell structure and function.
The recent hypothesis that prions can form permeable pores and
inﬂuence ion channels (Kourie et al., 2003), points to the predicted
drugs acting on sodium (like Lamotrigine, Amiloride, Quinidine)
or potassium channels (Glibenclamide), while Iron Dextran could
in principle be used to counteract metal ions dysmetabolism, a
common effect of several neurodegenerative pathologies. We were
also able to extrapolate three drugs acting on tyrosine kinase
activity, Aldesleukin , Insuline and Methymazole, in conjunction
with antioxidant compounds, such as L—cysteine, vitamin C, NADH,
succininc, L—glutamic acids and others, shown to be able to reduce
PrPSC propagation in infected cell (Kocisko et al., 2003).

3.5 Co-expression patterns across multiple species

The SRI approach provides an analysis of transcription changes that
is not restricted to individual isolated genes, but rather considers
the system as a whole. This method is hence appropriate to
characterize the prion protein interactome in its genetic network

Fig. 5. Conserved co—expression patterns: the connected component
emerging from the selection of the conserved graph of co—expression
patterns across three different species is here represented. This subnetwork
consists of 943 genes and 2409 interactions (see Fig. 5a and Supplementary
Materials). Gene centric view (3): genes belonging to the identiﬁed
signiﬁcant enriched pathways are highlighted in different colors. Edge centric
view (b): by selecting only the predicted edges of genes belonging to
enriched categories and using the same color code, we highlighted the
‘compactness’ of relationships characterizing speciﬁc pathways, such as
oxidative phosphorylation, ribosome, long—term depression and proteosome
(see Supplementary Figs 83—84 for further details). Genes related
to neurodegenerative processes seemed to have many ‘promiscuous’
interactions linking to diverse biological processes (red edges).

context. Three nominal networks for mouse, rat and human (Fig. 4
and Section 2) were inferred from three large compendia of
transcriptional data. By retaining only the parts of these networks
with consistent signs, we were able to extrapolate the co—expression
patterns which are conserved among the three species. An analysis
of the connectivity of the resulting network clearly revealed
the presence of a major connected component (Supplementary
Fig. S3). Surprisingly, this conserved connected component
included several genes related to various neurodegenerative
diseases (i.e. Prnp/Prion diseases, Snca, Uchll/Parkinson’s disease,
Bacel/Alzheimer’s disease), making neurodegeneration one of the
most signiﬁcantly represented biological process (Fig. 5a and
Supplementary Table S7). It is tempting to speculate on the
fact that the conservation across species of these transcriptional
interdependencies, might reﬂect the important role of coordination
in their transcriptional regulation. The fact that a large fraction of
genes is related to neurodegenerative diseases suggests the existence
of a delicate balance at the transcriptional level, whose alteration
may have severe consequences. Focusing only on the relationships
identiﬁed for the genes belonging to the signiﬁcantly enriched
processes, we evinced an interesting property of this evolutionarily
conserved graph (Fig. 5b and Supplementary Fig. S3). While genes
related to cell cycle, ribosome and oxidative phosphorylation were
clustered in compact modules, genes related to neurodegeneration
(red dots) were sparser in the network, with many cross—talking
edges. Our results are complementary to other studies performing
global analysis of human protein interactions (Limviphuvadh et al.,
2007). In a recent work (Goﬁi et al., 2008), investigating the known
network of PPIs, the authors showed that genes characterized by an
altered expression level in neurodegenerative diseases take part in

many different pathways, reinforcing the concept of a multifactorial
pathogenesis of neurodegenerative disorders. In our study, relying
exclusively on transcriptional dependencies, similar conclusions are
drawn. This in turn supports our ﬁrst claim that key genes might be
responsible for mediating and triggering the systematic response to
a perturbing event (i.e. Prnp, see Supplementary Figs S3—S4) and
that even in such complex systems, valuable information can be
extrapolated by their transcriptional analysis.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we employed previously published gene expression
datasets to recognize the function of PrPC and its role in responding
to prion inoculation inducing incoherent gene expression variations
in a gene network model. A reverse engineering approach was here
adopted to analyze the data of Hwang et al. (2009) starting from
the basic assumption that a global transcriptional rearrangement
must take place in order to adapt to a new condition (i.e. prion
infection). Speciﬁc gene expression changes were expected to
trigger other expression variations to ﬁnally reach an internal state of
balance possibly different from the original one (see Figs 1 and 3).
Our model—based results restricted the spectrum of potential key
interactions, performing an educated selection of transcripts that
show an incoherent response with respect to the overall systemic
reaction to prion infection. The proposed framework offers new
insights into the physiological function of PrPC and the molecular
mechanisms underlying prion disease pathogenesis, unveiling a
potential key role of previously unsuspected genes. Our results
suggest that in order to fully explore the potential and advantages of
microarray technologies, the size of the collected datasets must be
large enough to capture the complete range of variations associated
with the studied phenomenon. In this perspective, the data derived
from a single experimental condition are complemented by the large
independent dataset. Here, we show that SRI is not only a valuable
tool to perform genome—wide studies in mammals, but is also capable
of predicting the complex effects of endogenous and exogenous
perturbations in a biological system, restricting the spectrum of
plausible relationships that have to be experimentally investigated.

ABSTRACT

Liquid chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the
dominant technological platform for proteomics. An LC-MS analysis of
a complex biological sample can be visualized as a ‘map’ of which the
positional coordinates are the mass-to-charge ratio (m/z) and chroma-
tographic retention time (RT) of the chemical species profiled.
Label-free quantitative proteomics requires the alignment and com-
parison of multiple LC-MS maps to ascertain the reproducibility of
experiments or reveal proteome changes under different conditions.
The main challenge in this task lies in correcting inevitable RT shifts.
Similar, but not identical, LC instruments and settings can cause pep-
tides to elute at very different times and sometimes in a different order,
violating the assumptions of many state-of—the-art alignment tools. To
meet this challenge, we developed LWBMatch, a new algorithm based
on weighted bipartite matching. Unlike existing tools, which search for
accurate warping functions to correct RT shifts, we directly seek a
peak-to-peak mapping by maximizing a global similarity function be-
tween two LC-MS maps. For alignment tasks with large RT shifts
(>5OOS), an approximate warping function is determined by locally
weighted scatterplot smoothing of potential matched features, de-
tected using a novel voting scheme based on co-elution. For valid-
ation, we defined the ground truth for alignment success based on
tandem mass spectrometry identifications from sequence searching.
We showed that our method outperforms several existing tools in
terms of precision and recall, and is capable of aligning maps from
different instruments and settings.

1 INTRODUCTION

Liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) is the
dominant technological platform in proteomics, capable of
proﬁling thousands of proteins in the biological sample in a
high-throughput and sensitive manner. In the most popular
workﬂow of shotgun proteomics, proteins in a complex mixture
are first digested into small peptides, which are then separated by
high-performance liquid chromatography, and eluted through an

electrospray ion source into the mass spectrometer. In the mass
spectrometer, the peptide ions are separated by their mass-
to-charge ratios (m/z) and converted to an electrical signal, the
intensity of which is a measure of abundance of the peptide ion.
Taken together, LC-MS data are three-dimensional, with each
peptide ion represented by three coordinates: its chromato-
graphic retention time (RT), its m/z and its signal intensity. In
some instruments, an additional step of tandem mass spectrom-
etry (MS/MS or MS2) can be taken to fragment each peptide,
yielding fragment ion (MS2) spectra from which the peptide can
be identified by computational methods. An LC-MS ‘map’ can
therefore be viewed as a comprehensive and quantitative profile
of the proteome being analyzed. Many proteomics experiments
rely on comparisons of LC-MS maps of different samples (Bisle
et al., 2006; Bottcher et al., 2008; Catchpole et al., 2005; Vissers
et al., 2007). For these experiments, it is necessary to match the
peak originating from the same peptide in different LC-MS
maps. This task can be easily accomplished if the m/z and the
RT coordinates of the same peptide stay constant in many
LC-MS runs. The m/z values usually vary within a limited and
predictable range, which depends on the mass resolution of the
mass spectrometer. However, the RT of a speciﬁc peptide heavily
depends on the instrument conditions and the composition of the
mixtures. For many technical reasons, even the same sample
analyzed by the same instrument with the same settings can
generate different LC-MS maps with shifts and distortions in
the RT dimension. This fact makes the association of the same
peptides across LC-MS maps difﬁcult because the shift of any
two LC-MS maps cannot be known in advance. To find the
corresponding peptides in the different LC-MS maps, time align-
ment must be conducted.

The ultimate goal of time alignment is to match peaks that
belong to the same peptides across different LC-MS maps. Based
on the type of input data on which the alignment algorithm
operates, LC-MS alignment methods can be categorized into
‘profile—based’ methods and ‘feature-based’ methods. Proﬁle-
based methods directly process the raw data obtained in the
LC-MS experiment, aiming to avoid errors introduced by a fea-
ture-finding algorithm. The early proﬁle-based methods compare
only the difference in total ion chromatograms (TIC), which is
the sequence of the sum of all signals at each time point. Typical
methods used in aligning TIC include dynamic time warping
(DTW) (Sakoe and Chiba, 1978), correction optimized warping
(COW) (Nielsen et al., 2002), parametric time warping (PTW)
(Eilers, 2004) and continuous hidden Markov models (HMM)
(Listgarten et al., 2005). TIC-based methods make little use of

the whole LC—MS map, disregarding most of the useful informa-
tion at the m/z dimension that can help alignment. Therefore,
recent approaches tried to use more information available in the
LC—MS maps by applying these time warping methods to many
isolated ion chromatograms at different m/z values (Christin
et al., 2008, 2010; Listgarten et al., 2007; Suits et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2003) or by deﬁning the spectral similarity of cor-
responding mass spectra as the objective function to be maxi-
mized (Finney et al., 2008; Prakash et al., 2006; Prince and
Marcotte, 2006). In general, proﬁle-based methods can produce
more accurate alignment results, but they are computationally
expensive and may require more resources in terms of computer
cycles and memory, especially for multiple alignments (Lange
et al., 2007, 2008; Vandenbogaert et al., 2008). Another limita-
tion of the aforementioned methods is that they only allow shift-
ing, stretching or shrinking of the time axis, and cannot deal with
the reversal of elution order. A recent publication suggested that
elution order reversals are not rare, especially at ﬁne timescales
(Snyder and Dolan, 2006), and when the LC—MS maps are
acquired in slightly different settings.

Feature-based approaches operate on ‘features’ in the LC-MS
map detected by a feature-ﬁnding algorithm, which tries to
distinguish between peptide features and irrelevant noise in the
LC—MS experiment. The resulting feature list, which condenses
the raw data into (m/z, RT) coordinates of interest, are used in
the subsequent alignment. Many feature-based alignment algo-
rithms have been developed, either implemented as stand-alone
tools or as a part of software platforms for label-free quantitative
proteomics. Examples are MZmine (Katajamaa and Oresic,
2005), MapAligner in OpenMS (Lange et al., 2007), SuperHirn
(Mueller et al., 2007), XCMS (Smith et al., 2006), SpecArray
(Li et al., 2005) and XAlign (Zhang et al., 2005). Except
MZmine, which simply attempts to ﬁnd peak matches within a
tolerance window, all of these methods attempt to estimate a
linear (MapAligner, XAlign) or nonlinear warping function
(others) to correct the RT axis. More recently, Zhang (2012)
has proposed a divide-and-conquer algorithm that can handle
both low-resolution and high-resolution LC-MS maps. Noy
et al. (2011) propose a novel feature-matching algorithm using
a robust nonparametric kernel-type regression model to detect a
nonlinear alignment, and a wavelet-based method to incorporate
peak shape information for resolving ambiguous matches. In
contrast to proﬁle-based methods, feature-based approaches typ-
ically rely on high-resolution data for effective feature ﬁnding,
whereas proﬁle-based methods are generally able to work well on
low-resolution LC-MS data. Time alignment methods for
LC—MS data are reviewed in Aberg et al. (2009), America and
Cordewener (2008), Dowsey et al. (2010), Lange et al. (2008),
Katajamaa and Oresic (2007) and Vandenbogaert et al. (2008).

Accurate mass and time (AMT) tagging is another related
class of LC—MS data processing methods (Jaitly et al., 2006;
May et al., 2007). In AMT methods, the objective is to associate
each peptide with the m/z and RT coordinates at which it is
expected to be found, such that peaks detected in future
LC—MS can be identiﬁed to the originating peptides without
the help of MS/MS. To correct for potential RT shifts caused
by instrument noise or changes in experimental conditions, AMT
methods also need to perform time alignment, but in a different
manner. Given the peptide identiﬁcations, AMT methods

typically attempt to associate the raw RT with a predicted hydro-
phobicity measure of the peptide, and store these in an AMT
database, usually specialized to each biological sample. Then,
subsequent LC-MS maps from the same sample are analyzed
by first converting raw RT into a hydrophobicity measure, usu-
ally using information of the elution gradient program, and then
searching the coordinates in the AMT database to ﬁnd the clo-
sest matched peptide. AMT methods are therefore theoretically
capable of aligning LC—MS maps across vastly different condi-
tions, as time alignment is assisted by the knowledge of the pep-
tide identiﬁcation and the elution gradient. Potentially large RT
shifts caused by differences in elution conditions can be cor-
rected. However, AMT methods depend on the availability of
peptide identiﬁcations and the accuracy of hydrophobicity pre-
dictions, and may not be generally applicable to all types of
LC-MS data.

In this article, we propose a feature-based LC-MS alignment
method called LWBMatch, based on maximum weighted bipart-
ite matching. LWBMatch is a multiple alignment method that is
capable of aligning maps with large systematic and nonlinear RT
shifts. Similar to other feature-based methods, an optional pre-
liminary step first extracts likely matching features in the LC-MS
maps to detect potential large RT shifts. A warping function is
then ﬁtted by locally weighted scatterplot smoothing (LOWESS).
However, unlike existing methods that try to determine the warp-
ing function accurately on a ﬁne timescale, our warping function
needs only to be approximate and mainly serves to bring match-
ing features into proximity. The key innovation of our method is
the subsequent step that relies on a global maximization algo-
rithm based on weighted bipartite matching to match features
exhaustively, producing an optimal feature-to-feature mapping
that maximizes the similarity between two LC-MS maps. As a
result, small elution order changes of the peptides and other RT
variations caused by instrument noise will have minor effects on
the performance. We demonstrate that our method can align LC-
MS maps generated from the same conditions even without the
warping step, and can also handle maps generated from different
instruments and settings after approximate warping. We also
show that our method outperforms three existing feature-based
alignment methods.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Evaluation datasets

In our article, we attempted to align LC-MS maps with different level of
similarity. We approximately categorized alignment tasks into two
groups. ‘Homogeneous’ alignment is performed on datasets taken on
the same LC-MS instrument under identical conditions, within the
same batch of experiments. ‘Heterogeneous’ alignment is performed on
datasets from different instruments, under different chromatographic
conditions, or separated by long time intervals between acquisitions.

2.1.] The Standard Protein Mix Database The Standard Protein
Mix Database (Klimek et al., 2007) is a dataset generated by performing
repeated analyses of a standard sample of 18 trypsin-digested proteins
using 8 different mass spectrometers. Each analysis consists of 10 con-
secutively run replicates using the same chromatography column on the
same machine. Alignment of these replicates is ‘homogeneous’ by our
deﬁnition. Five standard mix preparations (Mix 1, Mix 2, Mix 3, Mix
4 and Mix 7) are analyzed at different times over many years. Alignment

of LC-MS maps from different ‘Mix’ datasets is ‘heterogeneous’.
To validate our alignment, the peptide identiﬁcations of the
MS2 spectra, determined by SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994), are used as
ground truths. Details about sample preparation, mass spectrometry set-
ting and searching parameters can be found in Klimek et al. (2007). In
our evaluation, we selected one analysis generated from high-resolution
instruments per ‘Mix’ (LTQ-FT for Mix 1, QSTAR for Mix 2, QTOF for
Mix 3 and Mix 4, LTQ-Orbitrap for Mix 7) as the test datasets. This is
because the feature-ﬁnding method we used in OpenMS, like other
existing feature-ﬁnding methods, only works well on high-resolution
datasets.

2.1.2 U205 Cell Dataset To test our method on a dataset with
whole proteome complexity, the U2OS Cell Dataset (Geiger et al.,
2012) was used. The U2OS Cell Dataset contains triplicate analysis of
a human cell line U2OS, each containing six runs from different peptide
fractions. One replicate was acquired on an LTQ-Orbitrap Velos mass
spectrometer, while the other two replicates were run in a separate
LTQ-Orbitrap Elite mass spectrometer. For the latter, the two replicates
were also acquired at different resolution and scan rates. In this dataset,
MS/MS spectra were searched by the Andromeda search engine.
Further information about sample preparation, protein digestion and
fractionation, LC-MS analysis and MS/MS searching can be found
in Geiger et al. (2012). Alignment of these replicates is treated as
‘heterogeneous’ because of the difference in instrument or acquisition
settings.

2.1.3 Feature detection Feature detection is not the focus of this
study. To conduct a fair evaluation, we detected and extracted peptide
signals in all the raw data maps using FeatureFinder, which is one of the
tools in the OpenMS suite (Kohlbacher et al., 2007), as inputs for all the
alignment methods. Therefore, notwithstanding potential misses or errors
in the feature-ﬁnding step, all alignment methods are compared on a fair
ground. A recent publication has compared many different feature detec-
tion methods and found OpenMS’s FeatureFinder to be one of the best in
its class (Hoekman et al., 2012).

2.2 WBMatch and homogeneous alignment

Our homogeneous alignment method, called WBMatch, is inspired by
maximum weighted bipartite matching. Unlike existing feature-based
alignment methods, it makes no assumption on the warping function of
the RT axis. Instead, we transform the homogeneous alignment problem
to a weighted matching problem in bipartite graphs and try to work out
an optimal matching. In the ﬁrst step, pairwise weight computations are
made for each pair of features (r, S) with r 6 reference and S 6 sample.
The weight function w is deﬁned in Section 2.3. In the second step of
WBMatch, a well-known weighted bipartite matching algorithm called
Kuhn—Munkres algorithm (Kuhn, 1955; Munkres, 1957) will be applied.
Because our adjacency matrix is sparse, an improvement using Fibonacci
heaps for the shortest path computation is adopted (Fredman and
Tarjan, 1987). The complexity of the algorithm is 0(|U|210g(|U|)),
where |U| is the number of features to be matched in the larger set.
The output of the Kuhn—Munkres algorithm is a mapping that attains
the maximum total weight W = Z w, summed over all matched features.
Note that the algorithm attempts to ﬁnd a unique partner in the second
map for each feature in the ﬁrst map. After the maximization, paired
features with a weight of 0 in the ﬁnal matching, which indicate that they
are outside of the tolerance window, are considered unmatched. The
ﬂowchart and pseudocode of WBMatch are given in Supplementary
Figures S1 and S2, respectively. More details about maximum weight
bipartite matching can be found in a comprehensive graph theory text-
book (West, 2001).

2.3 Determination of the weight function

The weight function is used to measure the similarity between two fea-
tures. We ﬁrst deﬁne the distance between two features as follows:

 

OO, IdeT> ART 01' dMZ > AMZ
DU” S) = { $01117" + A142 sz, Oth61‘S 
dRT = IRTU) — RT(S)|, sz = IMZU) — MZ(S)| (2)

where dRT and dMZ refer to the deviations in RT and m/z between two
features (r, s) in one pair. ART and AMZ are the maximum tolerances for
dRT and dMZ, respectively. The distance for any pair with difference in RT
or m/z larger than the tolerance will be assigned to a score of 00. We
tested four different transformation functions for converting the distance
measure into a similarity measure (Supplementary Fig. S3), and selecting
the fourth one that represents the best balance between precision and
recall:

(3)

W(D):L 1000 J

l + e/L‘Dﬂ1

where we set a = 18 and 2. = 6. This logistic function-like transformation
implements a ‘soft’ cutoff: as the distance grows, the similarity decreases
slowly at ﬁrst to retain good-quality matching pairs, and then decreases
sharply to remove the low-quality matching pairs. A three-dimensional
visualization of weight function is shown in Supplementary Figure S4.
All parameters are optimized using the Standard Protein Mix Database.

2.4 LWBMatch and heterogeneous alignment

In heterogeneous alignment, LC—MS maps acquired on different instru-
ments and under different settings are aligned. For such maps, even
though the time dimension can be shifted and distorted by large amounts,
sometimes nonlinearly, the RT deviations for corresponding features
across maps are still expected to follow a smooth curve. This is a neces-
sary consequence of the fact that elution orders are approximately
conserved. Given this observation, we combined LOWESS and
WBMatch to tackle the problem of heterogeneous alignment, which we
called LWBMatch. The ﬂowchart and pseudocode are given in
Supplementary Figures S1 and S5, respectively. The LOWESS procedure,
which will produce an approximate warping function between two maps,
consists of two steps. First, we extracted candidate feature pairs from
different maps if their m/z difference is within AMZ. Using only m/z
tolerance will yield many incorrectly matched candidates from which to
ﬁt the warping function. To identify the correct feature pairs among the
incorrect ones, we applied a voting strategy, shown in Supplementary
Figure S6. Based on the simple idea that co-eluting peptides in one
map will likely also be co-eluting in the other, for each time point in
the reference map, we selected the time point along the RT axis in the
sample map with the largest numbers of common features. Second, given
these correct feature pairs, the robust locally weighted regression model
(Cleveland, 1979) is applied on all the potential RT deviations to yield an
afﬁne transformation as the desired warping function (Supplementary
Fig. S7A). This warping function is applied to correct the RTs in one
map to match those of the other map. After this correction, most of the
new RT deviations are within 500 s (Supplementary Fig. S7B), and thus
WBMatch can be called on to produce more accurate feature-to-feature

mapping.

2.5 Multiple alignment and hierarchical clustering

Multiple alignment, which is the alignment of more than two LC-MS
maps, is often necessary in larger studies. Pairwise alignment of all maps
in the set is often infeasible, as the computational expense will grow
exponentially with the number of maps. Therefore, LWBMatch con-
structs a hierarchical alignment topology based on the similarity of

LC—MS maps automatically. For every possible pair of maps, the
approximate measure of similarity is calculated as the average RT
shifts of all potential feature pairs detected before the LOWESS step
(deﬁned in Section 2.4). Smaller average shifts indicate that the two
maps are more similar, and more similar maps will be aligned earlier in
a hierarchical clustering strategy.

3 EVALUATION STUDY

3.1 Ground truth, precision and recall

We established ground truth for the Standard Protein Mix
Database and U2OS cell datasets by means of MS/MS
information and identiﬁcation results. Our ground truth consists
of features that could be annotated with reliable peptide identi-
ﬁcations. PeptideProphet and iProphet (Keller et al., 2005;
Shteynberg et al., 2011) were used to assess the reliability of
peptide identiﬁcations, and we retained identiﬁcations at a
false discovery rate of 1%. Then, in each LC-MS map, whenever
present, multiple MS/MS spectra that are assigned to the same
identiﬁcation are grouped together and represented by a single
feature of coordinates equal to the average of those of the
replicate MS/MS spectra. The ground truths from different
maps to be aligned are listed in an identiﬁcation matrix, where
each row is a unique identiﬁcation, and each column contains the
features of one LC-MS map. An example of identiﬁcation matrix
is shown in Supplementary Table S1. In each row, every pair of
two features is counted as a ground truth. For example, if a given
identiﬁcation can be found in 5 maps, then there are 10
(= 4+ 3 —l—2+ l) feature pairs in the ground truth set that can
be potentially aligned.

The purpose of LC-MS alignment is to ﬁnd groups of corres-
ponding features that originate from same peptides. From this
perspective, we formulate the measure of alignment success as
that of an information retrieval problem. In information
retrieval, ‘precision’ is the fraction of retrieved instances that
are relevant, whereas ‘recall’ is the fraction of relevant instances
that are retrieved. In our case, the relevant instances are feature
pairs across different maps with the same peptide identiﬁcation,
whereas the retrieved instances are the feature pairs found by our
algorithm. A perfect alignment will have both precision and recall
equal to 1. False positives (erroneously matched features) will
lower the alignment precision and false negatives (erroneously
unmatched features) will lower the alignment recall. For each
dataset, we calculated these performance metrics for our
method and three different benchmarks described below, with
parameters listed in Supplementary Table S2. For the purpose
of calculating recall, we ignored all identiﬁcations whose coord-
inates are not located close to any features in the map. These
omissions are likely due to the imperfections in the feature-ﬁnd-
ing algorithm.

Note that the size and identiﬁcation accuracy of the ground-
truth set is inﬂuenced by the choice of the false discovery rate
cutoff, which is arbitrary, albeit customary, in shotgun
proteomics experiments. Therefore, the precision and recall
values are intended to be metrics for the comparison of different
methods given identical input. Also note that in our testing, we
allow the program to align all maps in the Standard Protein Mix
datasets and U2OS datasets as a multiple alignment problem,
regardless of whether the alignment is homogenous (within

dataset) or heterogeneous (across dataset). To highlight the per-
formance speciﬁcally for the more difﬁcult heterogeneous align-
ment, we only count pairs that are present across at least two
different datasets in the calculation of precision and recall.

3.2 Estimating the difﬁculty of the alignment task

We used two metrics to estimate the difﬁculty of a given align-
ment task. The ﬁrst is the distribution of RT shifts of ground-
truth pairs. Larger average RT shifts and larger variance in the
RT shifts imply more difﬁcult alignment tasks owing to system-
atic and random RT variations that likely result from changes in
experimental conditions. The second is the frequency of elution
order reversals. The more frequently pairs of peptides elute in
opposite orders in different maps, the more difﬁcult the align-
ment task should be. To count the elution order reversals,
ground-truth pairs are ﬁrst sorted by their RTs in the reference
map (RT 1), from smallest to largest. If the elution order is con-
served, the RT of the corresponding feature in the other map
(RT 2) should be monotonically increasing as we go down this
list. We count the number of times that the rank of RT 1 increases
in the sorting list while the rank of RT 2 decreases; this is the
number of elution order reversals between those two maps. To
allow for some inevitable noisy variations in locating the apex of
the elution peak by the feature-ﬁnding algorithm, we round the
RT to the nearest 50 s in this exercise, so that these small vari-
ations will not be counted as elution order reversals. We report
the ratio of the number of elution order reversals to the total
number of ground-truth pairs (Fig. l).

3.3 Benchmarking against existing alignment methods

Three existing feature-based alignment methods were used as
benchmarks for our method: the tool MapAligner (Lange
et al., 2007) in OpenMS (Sturm et al., 2008), SuperHirn
(Mueller et al., 2007) and a modiﬁed DTW implemented by
us. For all alignment tasks, we applied LWBMatch rather than
WBMatch because in the case of homogenous alignment,
LWBMatch will degenerate into WBMatch because the
LOWESS model will generate a warping function close to the
diagonal, such that essentially no warping is applied.

All tools are challenged with a multiple alignment problem
comprising all LC-MS maps of the dataset(s), with the features
in each map detected by the same FeatureFinder algorithm in
OpenMS beforehand. Note that the MapAligner and the mod-
iﬁed DTW use the map with the most features as the starting
point and align all other maps to this one. Superhirn uses a
hierarchical clustering approach similar to ours, albeit with dif-
ferent deﬁnitions of the similarity measure between pairs of LC-
MS maps. Brieﬂy speaking, the similarity measure in SuperHirn
is based on the overlap of features and reproducibility of their
intensity values, whereas ours is based on the potential RT shifts.

For a fair comparison, LWBMatch, MapAligner and
SuperHirn are tested using the same matching tolerance windows
(Supplementary Table S2). Note that all three tools use two sets
of tolerances. The pre—warping tolerance speciﬁes how far one
can go to ﬁnd matching ‘landmark’ feature pairs as input to
ﬁtting the warping function. To perform heterogeneous align-
ment with potentially large and unpredictable RT shifts, only
an m/z tolerance based on the mass resolution of the instrument

Fig. 1. The elution order reversal ratios of different evaluation datasets

is used. No restriction is placed on the RTs of the matching
feature pair for all three tools. The post-warping tolerance
speciﬁes the maximum deviations within which one can declare
two features to be matched, after applying the warping function.
For LWBMatch, this is the tolerance used in the WBMatch step,
i.e. ART and Amz.

DTW is originally a signal-based method, but in this study we
adapted it to work on feature maps. Features in the same map
are sorted by RT from lowest to highest, resulting in a sequence
of feature vectors. Dynamic programming is applied on the two
sequences to be aligned to maximize the similarity of the two
sequences by allowing shifts. The score of the alignment path P is
calculated iteratively in equation 4. A diagonal transition can be
performed on Cond. 2, whereas a shrink and a stretch in
reference relative to sample can be conducted on Cond. l. The
action with highest score of corresponding path will be taken. In
the end, the highest scoring path P(n, m), where n and m refer to
the number of features in reference and sample, respectively,
speciﬁes how features in one map should be matched to those
in the other.

For DTW, there is no separate step of ﬁnding landmark fea-
ture pairs to ﬁt an approximate warping function. Therefore,
only an m/z tolerance is speciﬁed (MZ,), which is set equal to
Amz. There is no restriction on the RT shift allowed.

The running time performance of LWBMatch, as compared
with the benchmarks, is shown in Supplementary Figure S8.

Fig. 2. The boxplot of RT deviations. The bottom and top of the box are
the ﬁrst and third quartiles, and the band inside the box is the second
quartile. The ends of the whiskers below and above the box mean the
lowest and highest datum within 1.5 Interquartile Range (IQR) of each
quartile, respectively. Any data not included between the whiskers are
plotted as an outlier with a small circle

distribution of RT deviations for these datasets, the absolute
values of the RT deviations of all ground-truth pairs are
shown in a box-whisker plot (Fig. 2). Most of the RT shifts in
the homogeneous datasets are <200 s, except in Mix 4, in which
one-ﬁfth of the RT shifts are >200 s. This can be traced to two
runs: QT 20060925_mix4_23 and QT 20060926_mix4_19, in
which peptides appear to elute ~400s later than in the other
eight runs. Compared with the RT shifts of homogeneous data-
sets, the RT shifts in the Standard Protein Mix and U2OS data-
sets are much larger, which range from 200 s to 2000 s. In
addition, the boxes’ widths is wider, implying that the RT time
shifts also vary more signiﬁcantly.

The frequency of elution order reversal for all the test datasets
is shown in Figure 1. From the ﬁgure, the elution order reversal
ratios of homogeneous datasets are <2% except Mix 4. This is
one important reason why the alignment performance for Mix 4
is not so good compared with that of other datasets, shown in
Figure 3A. For the heterogeneous cases, the average of elution
order reversal ratios of U2OS datasets and the Standard Protein
Mix datasets are 6.3 and 2.4%, respectively, which is larger than
that of homogeneous cases.

4.2 Results for homogeneous alignment

To test the performance of multiple homogenous alignment, we
selected 10 consecutively run replicates on the same machine
from the Standard Protein Mix dataset. This includes the
LTQ-FT runs of Mix 1, QSTAR runs of Mix 2, QTOF runs
of Mix 3, QTOF runs of Mix 4 and the LTQ-Orbitrap runs of
Mix 7. In addition, OR20070924_S_mix7_ll from Mix 7 was
removed because this map has a little signal and appears to be
a failed LC-MS run.

Figure 3A shows the results for different homogeneous
alignment methods. The performance of the LWBMatch is
among the best, especially for the challenging dataset Mix 4,
which has by far the largest RT shifts and elution order reversal
ratios among those tested. Generally, LWBMatch offered similar
precision to other methods, but much higher recall values,

4.3 Results for heterogeneous alignment

The results of heterogeneous alignment methods are shown in
Figure 3B and C. Four methods are compared again in this
evaluation, but because most of the recall values for
MapAligner and SuperHirn are close to 0, we only list the results
for LWBMatch and modiﬁed DTW. From Figure 3B and C, we
observe that LWBMatch can achieve a satisfactory precision and
reasonable recall, although the results are poorer compared with
the homogeneous cases.

On inspection, we found that the failure of MapAligner and
SuperHirn can be traced to the same problem—an inability to
extract correct landmark feature pairs. MapAligner searches for
landmark feature pairs within a small m/z window. In case of
multiple feature pairs at the same m/z, it resolves the ambiguity
by choosing the pair with the smallest RT shift. This turns out to
be a poor assumption for heterogeneous alignments. In
SuperHirn’s case, too many incorrect landmark feature pairs
are admitted when the pre-warping RT tolerance is disabled to
accommodate heterogeneous alignment with large RT shifts. It
has no mechanism to ﬁlter out incorrect landmark feature pairs.
Given these wrong inputs, the ﬁtted warping function (in
MapAligner) or the LOWESS model (in SuperHirn) was
simply incorrect.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The alignment of LC-MS maps has been a well-studied topic in
proteomics and a critical step in label-free quantitative

proteomics, a work-ﬂow commonly used in traditional bio-
marker discovery. In such experiments, one would attempt to
analyze the two samples as similarly as possible, usually on the
same machine and consecutively in time. As proteomics technol-
ogy advances, however, the ambition of scientists and hence the
size of experiments have also grown over time. Given the larger
number of samples, it becomes necessary to spread the runs out
over weeks or months, or use multiple instruments in parallel. In
both cases, existing LC-MS alignment tools often fail, as they fail
to anticipate large RT shifts or elution order reversals that can
occur when the experiments are conducted in slightly different
conditions. Partly due to this difﬁculty in LC-MS alignment,
other quantitative approaches, such as stable isotope labeling
methods and MS2-based spectral counting, have emerged in
recent years. However, the label-free, LC-MS-based method
still retains important advantages. It can be used to compare
theoretically inﬁnite number of samples, is generally applicable
to all biological systems, requires no expensive stable isotope
labeling reagents and is a true unbiased proﬁling technique.
Compared with spectral counting, it allows the quantiﬁcation
of analytes even when MS/MS identiﬁcations were not available
or not consistently present for that analyte in all experimental
runs (Mueller et al., 2008).

Conventional LC-MS time alignment methods all focus on
ﬁnding a warping function between two maps. To limit the
search space for this warping function, one or more of the follow-
ing assumptions are often made: (i) the warping function is mono-
tonic, that is, peptides elute in the same order in time; (ii) matching
features are within a small RT tolerance, typically several minutes;
and (iii) the warping function is linear or at least locally linear. In
practice, however, these assumptions are frequently violated, es-
pecially when the maps to be aligned are acquired on different
chromatographic columns or under different settings. The result-
ing alignment is prone to error regardless of the numerical and
optimization methods used to ﬁnd the warping function.

Graph-based peak alignment algorithms

 

To solve this problem, we developed a two-step method that
approaches the challenge differently. For sufﬁciently similar
maps, which we termed homogeneous alignments, we bypassed
the step of ﬁnding the warping function entirely, and instead
attempted to identify matching features directly. We note that
the warping function itself is only a means to the end, which is
the set of matching features across many LC-MS maps, from
which biological information can be obtained. The alignment
problem is instead formulated as a familiar problem in graph
theory with an efﬁcient solution. We showed that this method,
WBMatch, outperforms existing feature-based methods, particu-
larly in recall. The increased performance is likely owing to the
fact that our method does not assume monotonicity or linearity
of the warping function, and allows each feature to be matched
independently.

To handle the more challenging ‘heterogeneous’ alignment
tasks, such as when the LC-MS maps are acquired on different
instruments, we also proposed an enhancement to WBMatch
called LWBMatch. To correct large RT shifts between different
maps, we applied a voting strategy to detect potential correct
shifts and then LOWESS is used to ﬁt a warping function.
Although LOWESS is also used as a curve ﬁtting strategy in
some existing tools, LWBMatch allows a much wider RT toler-
ance and uses the co-occurrence of features at the same time as a
way to minimize false matches. The warping function is then
applied to one of the maps, such that the RT shifts are small
enough to be aligned by WBMatch. Unlike existing tools, our
method did not need to determine the warping function to a ﬁne
timescale, which was because of the effectiveness of the
WBMatch step. Overall, this two-step approach assumes that
elution order is only approximately conserved on a long time-
scale, but can be reversed frequently within a short time-scale.
We believe this assumption is closer to the reality and therefore
makes our method more successful than the existing approaches.

In terms of limitation, LWBMatch currently operates on a list
of features detected from LC-MS maps. Therefore, it relies on an
effective algorithm for feature ﬁnding, which typically is designed
for high-resolution data. Thus, at present, LWBMatch is only
applicable to high-resolution datasets. Of course, for successful
alignment, there must still exist sufﬁcient similarity between the
maps to be aligned. For instance, the chromatography must be
based on similar chemistry. Given that nowadays almost all
LC-MS proteomics experiments use reverse-phase chromatog-
raphy and similar solvents, we expect our method to be applic-
able to most cases. However, perhaps unsurprisingly, the degree
of success (as measured by precision and recall) varies from
dataset to dataset and is somewhat correlated with the similarity
between the maps (as measured by RT shifts and elution order
reversals). Future work will focus on overcoming these limita-
tions, and also on improving the algorithm further for the more
challenging cases.

As a powerful analytical platform, LC—MS can also potentially
ﬁnd applications beyond traditional biomarker discovery experi-
ments. A good LC—MS alignment algorithm can make it possible
to use LC-MS maps as ‘ﬁngerprints’ of biological samples, for
instance to identify microorganisms by their proteome or meta-
bolome. Finally, given that many LC-MS experiments are
conducted by proteomics facilities everywhere on similar sam-
ples, often using comparable but not identical platforms, we

reason that one can potentially use our method to copy peptide
identiﬁcations from one map to another, thereby improving
identiﬁcation rates and reducing the expensive computation
needed for MS2 identiﬁcation. This capability can be a useful
addition to proteomics data repositories.

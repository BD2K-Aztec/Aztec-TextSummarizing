ABSTRACT

Summary: We present methle track, an efficient mechanism for
visualizing single-base resolution DNA methylation data on a
genome browser. The methle track dynamically integrates the level
of methylation, the position and context of the methylated cytosine (i.e.
CG, CHG and CHH), strand and confidence level (e.g. read coverage
depth in the case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing data).
Investigators can access and integrate these information visually at
specific locus or at the genome-wide level on the WashU
EpiGenome Browser in the context of other rich epigenomic datasets.
Availability and implementation: The methle track is part of the
WashU EpiGenome Browser, which is open source and freely avail-
able at http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/browser/. The most up-to-
date instructions and tools for preparing methle track are available at
http://epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/+/cmtk.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation is a well-studied epigenetic mark. It plays cru-
cial roles in development, gene regulation, chromatin structure,
imprinting and many diseases (Esteller, 2007). DNA methylation
primarily occurs as 5-methylcytosine in the CpG context.
In specific cell types, such as embryonic stem cells (ESCs),
5-methylcytosine sometimes occurs in the context of CHG and
CHH (H is A, T or C) (Lister et al., 2009). Usually CpG methy-
lation is symmetrical between the two DNA strands, but hemi-
methylation, where only one strand is methylated, can be
observed. Several modern techniques measure DNA methylation
at single-base resolution, including whole-genome bisulfite
sequencing ONGBS or methle-seq; Lister et al., 2009), reduced
representation bisulﬁte sequencing (RRBS; Meissener et al.,
2005) and Illumina Infinium arrays. Bisulfite sequencing-based
methods can provide information including non-CpG menthyla-
tion, strand-specific methylation and confidence level (read
depth; Ziller et al., 2013) and are considered the gold standard
in the field.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Typically, DNA methylation data can be visualized on a
genome browser as a track of bar plots, where the position of
each bar marks a measured cytosine, and the height represents
the methylation level. An example of a WGBS track and
Infinium 450K track on the UCSC Genome Browser is shown
in Supplementary Figure S1. However, several parameters
important for data interpretation are missing in this visual rep-
resentation. First, non-CG methylation is omitted; second,
strand-specific information provided by WGBS is removed;
third, sequencing coverage, a key measurement of the data con-
fidence, cannot be assessed visually; fourth, a cytosine with “zero
percent’ methylation (or completely unmethylated) is not visually
distinguishable from ‘no value’. The Anno-J Browser (http://
www.annoj.org) can display strand-specific and context-specific
methylation as composite bar charts (Supplementary Fig. S2).
However, it does not distinguish unmethylated cytosines from
cytosines with no data and can not combine the two strands.
Anno-J requires a special data storage format that is not com-
patible with most popular genomics tools.

To address these issues, we extended the WashU EpiGenome
Browser (Zhou et al., 2011, 2013) by inventing the methle track
for genome-wide single-base DNA methylation data represented
by WGBS. Cytosine methylation levels are displayed as conven-
tional bar plots, but investigators can display and distinguish cyto-
sines in different context and choose to display strand-
specific DNA methylation or to dynamically combine both
strands. An overlayed curve displays read-depth data at each cyto-
sine, allowing investigators to assess quality of the data. By using a
different background color, investigators can easily focus on
unmethylated cytosines without confusing those cytosines with
no measurement. Importantly, investigators do not need to re-
format their data. Our data format is fully compatible with the
UCSC Genome Browser. Investigators can mimic some features
of our visualization with the UCSC Genome Browser (Supple-
mentary Fig. S3), but the WashU EpiGenome Browser provides
more flexibility in combining data and toggling between views.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

We store all relevant data in bedGraph format for compatibility.
Depending on the experiment type, up to eight bedGraph files are
generated for one experiment (e.g. WGBS) to store CG, CHG
and CHH methylation level data and read-depth data for each
DNA strand. Most files are optional. For example, for Infinium

and IMR90. WGBS data are displayed in strand-speciﬁc mode. Cytosine methylation levels and contexts are identified using combinations of fore-
ground/background bar colors (blue/ gray for CG, orange/light orange for CHG and magenta/light magenta for CHH). Read depth (smoothed over 4 kb
windows) is displayed as a black curve. (c) A zoomed-in view of H1 ESC WGBS data [marked by light red box in (b)]. The left axis marks methylation

arrays only CG methylation level is necessary. Data files are com-
pressed, indexed by Tabix (Li, 2009) and hosted on Web servers.
The bedGraph file URLs are organized into a single methle
track using J SON (Fig. la) and displayed via the datahub mech-
anism (http: / / epigenomegateway.wustl.edu/ —l— / hub).

To illustrate the different visualization options, we displayed
Infinium, RRBS and WGBS of ESC H1 (H1 ESC) and WGBS
of IMR90 cells in Figure lb. WGBS data are from Lister et al.
(2009) and are displayed as context-specific and strand-specific
values. Bar plots in the foreground indicate methylation levels
with context-specific colors. Completely unmethylated cytosines
are distinguished from cytosines with no data by a different
user-configurable background color. The read-depth data are
displayed as a line plot. In Figure lb, the sparseness of
Infinium and RRBS is visually obvious, and unmethylated
Cst are visually distinct from Cst with no value.
Compared with Infinium and RRBS data, WGBS clearly reveals
more dynamics of DNA methylation across the regions and
between the samples. Both Hl ESC and IMR90 are lowly methy-
lated over the HOXA gene cluster. A region with elevated
methylation in IMR90 is marked by a black box. It lies at the
boundary of two chromatin domains (Supplementary Fig. S4).
The methylation increase correlates with the bipartite histone
modification pattern over HOXA cluster in IMR90 (Zhou
et al., 2013). Figure 1d shows the WGBS data with two DNA
strands combined. Figure 1e displays a zoomed-out view after
combining data of the two strands, where the prevalence of non-
CpG methylation in H1 ESC can be easily appreciated.

3 CONCLUSION

The methle track on WashU EpiGenome Browser contrib-
utes simple but powerful innovations for visually exploring

genome-wide single-base resolution DNA methylation data.
The track is easy to prepare using standard bedGraph format
files and is compatible with most common genomics tools. The
track design is highly ﬂexible and can be easily extended to in-
corporate new aspects of DNA methylation including allelic
methylation, hydroxymethylation, and other complex genomics
datasets.

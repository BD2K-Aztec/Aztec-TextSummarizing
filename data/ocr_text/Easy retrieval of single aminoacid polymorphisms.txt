ABSTRACT

Summary: The SwissVar portal provides access to a comprehensive
collection of single amino acid polymorphisms and diseases in
the UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot database via a unique search engine. In
particular, it gives direct access to the newly improved Swiss-Prot
variant pages. The key strength of this portal is that it provides a
possibility to query for similar diseases, as well as the underlying
protein products and the molecular details of each variant. In the
context of the recently proposed molecular view on diseases, the
SwissVar portal should be in a unique position to provide valuable
information for researchers and to advance research in this area.
Availability: The SwissVar portal is available at
www.expasy.org/swissvar

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Human variation data is one of the most valuable information
originating from the Human Genome Project (HGP). The current
challenge is how to optimally exploit this data to better understand
disease association and accelerate the pace towards personalized
treatments. Indeed, there are still numerous unanswered questions
on the exact relationship between genetic variations, phenotypes
and diseases. A plethora of databases or prediction tools exist
(Thusberg et al., 2009). Among the databases, only few are central
databases covering mutations on all genes. They are mostly gene-
centric, with little information related to the proteome. The disease
and phenotype information are also currently unstructured, making
speciﬁc queries difﬁcult. This is a pity, particularly in the context of
the recently proposed molecular View on diseases, which emphasizes
the relationship between the disease/phenotypic networks and the
underlying protein interaction or functional networks (Lage et al.,
2007; Oti et al., 2008). Indeed, the possibility to query for similar
diseases, as well as the underlying protein products and the
molecular details of each variant might prove extremely useful for
researchers to study a particular family of disorders or to formulate
hypotheses for further research.

In this article, we present the SwissVar portal (www.expasy.org/
swissvar), which provides access to a comprehensive collection
of single amino acid polymorphisms (SAPs) and diseases in the
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot knowledgebase Via a unique search engine.
This represents nearly 3300 diseases and 60 000 human protein
variations (release 57.10) (Yip et al., 2008). In addition, SwissVar
gives direct access to the newly improved Swiss-Prot variant pages
that are widely cited by the community but can not be queried, up
to now.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

SwissVar accesses two relational databases that store data on variants
and diseases. The database UniMed contains disease information
extracted from UniProtKB/SwissProt and their mapping to MeSH
terms (Mottaz et al., 2008). The variant data is found in the
ModSNP database (Yip et al., 2004). Structural information is
calculated through SSMAP, a residue—residue mapping of Protein
Data Bank (PDB) structures (David et al., 2008). The databases are
implemented in PostgreSQL 8.1.9 and are updated at each UniProt
release.

The system implementation is based on a three-tier architecture.
CGI programs written in Perl query the databases and dynamically
generate the web pages. The interface is accessible with the main
web browsers.

3 FEATURES
3.1 Query options

Three main search categories are provided: (i) by diseases, (ii) by
gene/protein names and (iii) by variant types or functional/structural
features.

Query by disease terms enable search using disease names, OMIM
identiﬁers or MeSH terms of the disease category. This query is
powerful in that it exploits the mapping between Swiss-Prot disease
names and MeSH terms (Mottaz et al., 2008), as well as the hierarchy
in MeSH to assemble groups of diseases to a granularity deﬁned by
users. For example, the users can query for all proteins related to
metabolism diseases, and gather in one click proteins and variants
related to refsum disease, gout etc. The representation of the MeSH
hierarchy further enables the Visualization and navigation inside the
categories of diseases in which the queried proteins are implicated.

The second axis of query is protein centric. Users can search with
a protein or gene name, as well as Swiss-Prot identiﬁers (AC or ID).
Queries with gene names are automatically normalized using a list of

synonyms. This option could be particularly useful when analyzing
gene or protein expression data.

Finally, variants recorded in Swiss-Prot/UniProtKB can be
searched by their molecular characteristics. Several attributes of
the amino acid concerned by the mutation can be speciﬁed, e.g.
the conservation score of the residue, its surrounding environment
(both sequential and structural), its surface accessibility as well as its
involvement in interfaces are all adjustable parameters. The variants
can also be queried using Swiss-Prot feature identiﬁer (FTID),
dbSNP rsID, the position of the mutation or the type of amino acid
change.

The combination of all search parameters is possible. This
combination strongly enhances the query power and the information
content of the tool. For example, it is possible to retrieve all variants
implicated in metabolic brain diseases, which are within 4A of a
metal binding site (Supplementary Fig. 1).

3.2 Result pages

The result of the search is presented in a table (Supplementary
Fig. 2), from which the users can have direct access to the original
UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot entry, the MeSH descriptor data, the Swiss-
Prot variant pages and the mapped PDB structure when available.
The Swiss-Prot variant pages concisely present a complete outline
of known information on each variant (Supplementary Figs 3 and 4).
They were recently improved by newly added features which
include the display of conservation score of the mutated residue
at sequence and structural level; the display of protein features
in the local structural environment of the variant (e.g. residues
involved in ligand binding or post-translational modiﬁcations)
as well as residues involved in protein—protein interaction when
experimentally resolved 3D information is available. It is hoped
that these information will further aid the users in understanding
or evaluating the potential functional effect of SAPs. New articles
on variants automatically retrieved through text-mining methods are
also proposed on the pages (Yip et al., 2007).

Results can be downloaded as lists (e.g. a list of the protein
accession numbers, a list of variant FTIDs or rsID) or in a
tab-delimited or XML format containing all the information.

4 DISCUSSION

With the completion of the Human proteome, the UniProtKB/Swiss-
Prot database has a complete collection of 20 330 human proteins
with increasingly detailed functional annotation (The UniProt
Consortium, 2009). The SwissVar portal gives access to this wealth
of data by further providing the possibility to gather proteins/variants
related to similar diseases, and allowing queries on variants using a
range of sequence and structural parameters.

Further improvement of the portal and the information content
is planned. First, data coverage: the current SAPs coverage is
clearly not exhaustive. However, as a partner of the GEN2PHEN
consortium (www.gen2phen.0rg), it is anticipated that data related
to SAPs from consortium members will be made Visible Via
UniProtKB and the Swiss-Prot variants pages. As such, the
SwissVar portal will continue to gain its value as the amount of

data grows. Second, disease terminology/phenotype information:
the portal currently relies on MeSH classiﬁcation that offers a
reasonably broad coverage of diseases including genetic diseases.
The classiﬁcation is nevertheless not entirely based on phenotypic
similarities. Incorporating comprehensive structured phenotype
information could enhance the disease query. New resources, such as
Human Phenotype Ontology (Robinson et al., 2009), are currently
being studied for this purpose. Finally, it is planned that pathway
information will be incorporated in the near future to allow seamless
integration and search between diseases, phenotypes, pathways and
detailed sequence and structural information of the variants.

5 CONCLUSION

In summary, the SwissVar portal provides a unique environment and
search facility to investigate the relationship between human variants
and phenotypes, with a particular focus on human proteome. To the
knowledge of the authors, no online servers offer this kind of search
possibilities that directly link molecular details of SAPs to disease
classiﬁcation. The current application also illustrates our ongoing
effort in bridging biological and medical information. The SwissVar
portal can be accessed Via www.expasy.org/swissvar.

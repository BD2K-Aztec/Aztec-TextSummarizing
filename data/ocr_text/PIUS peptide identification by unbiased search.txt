ABSTRACT

Summary: We present PIUS, a tool that identifies peptides from
tandem mass spectrometry data by analyzing the six-frame translation
of a complete genome. It differs from earlier studies that have per-
formed such a genomic search in two ways: (i) it considers a larger
search space and (ii) it is designed for natural peptide identification
rather than proteomics. Differently from other peptidomics tools
designed for genome-wide searches, PIUS does not limit the analysis
to a set of sequences that match a list of de novo reconstructions.

1 INTRODUCTION

In peptidomics, tandem mass spectroscopy is commonly used to
identify peptides: an unknown peptide undergoes fragmentation,
its fragment masses are registered in a so-called fragmentation
spectrum and the peptide sequence is inferred from this spec-
trum. This latter step is usually performed by database search
methods (Craig and Beavis, 2004): for each protein sequence in
the database, potential fragments are predicted with their theor-
etical fragmentation spectrum; a scoring function then measures
how well these spectra match the experimental one, returning the
top scoring solutions. However, if the peptide is not derived from
one of the database sequences, this strategy is bound to fail. In
peptidomics, there are still many unidentiﬁed spectra of good
quality, presumably partially because of this (Frank, 2009;
Menschaert et al., 2010a).

One strategy to deal with this limitation is to use de novo sequen-
cing, which infers the amino acid sequence from the mass differ-
ences between neighboring peaks in the spectrum. However, from
spectra of moderate quality, this strategy cannot extract enough
information to unambiguously infer the complete sequence.

Another strategy, which we adopt in this note, is to compare
the observed spectrum with the theoretical one of any peptide
that could be translated from the genome (Jeong et al., 2010;
Kim et al., 2009).

The proposed method, called PIUS (peptide identiﬁcation by
unbiased search), identiﬁes peptides from fragmentation spectra
using the six-frame translation of the complete genome. Even

though a peptide search against the complete translation of a
genome has been investigated in the context of proteogenomics
(Gupta et al., 2008; Kalume et al., 2005), these studies were
limited to small genomes (Kim et al., 2009) and/or used add-
itional assumptions that hold in the context of proteomics,
where protein digestion occurs in vitro at predictable cleavage
sites, but not in peptidomics, where the proteolytic processing
occurs in vivo at sites that are difﬁcult to predict. Further, these
studies aimed at protein/gene discovery, whereas PIUS aims at
peptide identiﬁcation. The latter requires a much higher recall
than the former: identifying a few of the peptides from a genomic
region usually sufﬁces to make a gene prediction. All in all, this
means that peptidomics presents a markedly different context
from proteomics.

Recently, three peptidomics methods have been proposed for
genome-wide searches: MS-Dictionary (Kim et al., 2009), MS-
GappedDictionary (Jeong et al., 2010) and IggyPep (Menschaert
et al., 2010a). The ﬁrst two methods build a list of de novo recon-
structions called a spectral dictionary and use it to reduce the
number of candidates in the search. IggyPep queries the full
genome translation using complete de novo reconstructions or par-
tial peptide sequence tags (PST). PIUS differs from these methods
because its search is exhaustive, not biased toward a subset of
candidates, and it eliminates the need for good-quality PSTs.

2 METHOD

We mention the main aspects of the method; a detailed algorithmic
description is available in the Supplementary Material.

In principle, PIUS analyzes all subsequences of the six-frame transla-
tion of the genome, checks whether their masses match that of the mea-
sured peptide (within an error tolerance) and returns the k highest-scoring
matches, given a scoring function. In practice, it organizes the search such
that pruning can be performed.

It starts with the ﬁrst position of the translated genome and adds the
subsequent residues one by one (sequence extension), until the mass either
matches or becomes larger than that of the measured peptide; in the
former case, the subsequence might enter the top k list depending on
its score. Then, it stops the sequence extension, moves to the next start
position and repeats the same procedure.

To mitigate the computational cost further, PIUS has a pruning pro-
cedure, which is based on the quality of the current subsequence as
estimated by the scoring function being used. PIUS investigates the ques-
tion ‘is this subsequence unlikely to be a preﬁx of the correct solution (i.e.
a fragment of the solution containing its N—terminal)?’. If so, the subse-
quence and its extensions are pruned. This is considered to be the case
when the subsequence scores less than or times the lowest score of all
preﬁxes of the same length in the top k list. The parameter or thus deter-
mines the eagerness to prune.

The default scoring function in PIUS is derived from the one used in
SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994). Although SEQUEST only considers ion
series b and y, PIUS considers the ion series b, b*, b0, a, a*, (1", y, y*
and yo. We assign a weight to each ion series to give more importance to
abundant ions. To deﬁne the weights, we measured the relative frequency
of each ion series in a distinct dataset used only for this purpose and for
which the correct identiﬁcations were known. The user can reuse our
weights or deﬁne his own.

Our search strategy does not consider sequences originating through
splicing, neither does it account for polymorphism. We discuss possible
strategies to handle these challenges in Section 3.5 of the Supplementary
Material.

3 EXPERIMENTS AND RESULTS

We evaluated PIUS on a subset of 109 spectra from a combined set
of peptide mass spectra from different mouse tissue and cell line
samples produced by MALDI-TOF—TOF (IWT-50164, 2006—
2010; Van Dijck et al., 2011). The subset was obtained as follows.
We used a combination of two search algorithms (XlTandem and
OMSSA) within SearchGui to obtain the peptide identiﬁcation,
allowing for the following PTMs: N—term acetylation, C-term ami-
dation, oxidation on M and pyroglutamination on N—term Q. We
analyzed the results with Peptide-Shaker and retained only those
with a conﬁdence level of 100%, allowing us to use them as a gold
standard. Among the 109 spectra, six have a PTM. We compared
our results with those of MS-GappedDictionary.

We used PIUS with an error tolerance of 0.5 kDa for both
peptide and fragment mass, which is large enough to account
for measurement errors in MALDI—TOF—TOF data. We arbi-
trarily set k = 10,000 and at = 0.8. When searching for unmodi-
ﬁed translations, of the 103 unmodiﬁed spectra, PIUS returned
the gold standard solution (i) as the top 1 for 85 cases, (ii) as top
2 for 3 cases, (iii) in the top 10 of solutions for 8 cases, (iv) in a
lower ranking position for 7 cases. These results show that PIUS
is often able to reproduce deﬁnite identiﬁcations by XlTandem/
OMSSA, even though it searches a much larger space.

We also tested PIUS considering the same PTMs used to
deﬁne the gold standard solutions, allowing one PTM per can-
didate. For the spectra with PTMs, PIUS found the gold stand-
ard solution as (i) the top 1 for ﬁve cases and (ii) as the top 3 for
one case. For the spectra without PTMs, PIUS found the gold
standard solution (i) as the top 1 for 82 cases, (ii) as top 2 for 5
cases, (iii) in top 10 of solutions for 5 cases and (iv) in a lower
ranking position for 10 cases. For one case, PIUS pruned the
gold standard solution away. These results show that PIUS has a
high recall rate even when PTMs are considered.

We conﬁgured MS-GappedDictionary as recommended by its
authors: the charge range was set to 1, no enzymatic cleavage
was speciﬁed and all other parameters were left at their default
values. Note that this tool does not consider PTMs in the search.
Of the 103 unmodiﬁed spectra, MS-GappedDictionary found the
gold standard solution as (i) the top 1 for 48 cases and as (ii) the
top 2 for 2 cases. There were no hits for three cases and the gold
standard solution was not among the returned hits for 50 cases.
We also tested MS—GappedDictionary with the error tolerance
used by PIUS (0.5 kDa). With this lower tolerance, the gold
standard solution was (i) the top 1 for 57 cases, (ii) the top 2
for 2 cases and (iii) in the top 10 of solutions for 1 case. There
were no hits for 3 cases, and the gold standard solution was not

among the returned hits for 40 cases. This contrasts sharply with
the good results reported by Jeong et al. (2010). A possible ex-
planation for this inferior performance is the source of the mass
spectra; J eong et al. (2010) use other instruments that are gener-
ally more accurate than MALDI-TOF—TOF.

The current C implementation of PIUS has a throughput of
two spectra per hour on an Intel Core i7-2600 when searching the
21 mouse chromosomes, using at = 0.8. In case of large-scale
experiments, we recommend to use PIUS in a layered peptido-
mics workﬂow (Menschaert et al., 2010b). The workﬂow ﬁrst
searches databases in a conventional manner, and then calls on
PIUS for the remaining unidentiﬁed (but high quality) spectra.
In case this step would become a bottleneck, the algorithm can
easily be distributed.

4 CONCLUSION

Many spectra of candidate bioactive peptides remain unidenti-
ﬁed to date. To tackle this problem we present PIUS, an open
source tool for peptide identiﬁcation from tandem mass
spectrometry data. PIUS searches the entire genome without
previous assumptions to reduce the search space and is, there-
fore, most suited as a tool of last resort. We have validated PIUS
with MALDI-TOF-TOF spectra. Even when searching an entire
mammalian genome, PIUS obtains correct identiﬁcations in a
large majority of cases and has a much higher recall rate than
MS-GappedDictionary.

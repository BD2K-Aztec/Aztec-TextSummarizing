Abstract

Summary: Analyses of entire viral genomes or mtDNA requires comprehensive design of many
primers across their genomes. Furthermore, simultaneous optimization of several DNA primer
design criteria may improve overall experimental efficiency and downstream bioinformatic pro—
cessing. To achieve these goals, we developed PrimerDesign—M. It includes several options for
multiple—primer design, allowing researchers to efficiently design walking primers that cover long
DNA targets, such as entire HIV—1 genomes, and that optimizes primers simultaneously informed
by genetic diversity in multiple alignments and experimental design constraints given by the user.
PrimerDesign—M can also design primers that include DNA barcodes and minimize primer dimer—
ization. PrimerDesign—M finds optimal primers for highly variable DNA targets and facilitates
design flexibility by suggesting alternative designs to adapt to experimental conditions.

Availability and implementation: PrimerDesign—M is available as a webtool at http://wvwv.hiv.lanl.

1 Introduction

Primer design is complicated by many factors, including desired
primer specificity or promiscuity, restrictions in polymerase chain
reaction (PCR) or sequencing lengths, matching of melting tempera-
tures, heterogeneous evolutionary rates across genomes, avoiding
primer—primer dimerization and integrating bio—barcodes. Typically,
the process of finding the optimal placements for primers is a serial
process in which each of the design criteria are optimized one at a
time. This is unfortunate as one design step may inﬂuence another.
Thus, designing primers while optimizing all design criteria simul-
taneously is desirable. Because no existing software was able to do
that, we recently developed a tool that could include all these
factors, given a multiple—alignment and user input on desired
constraints, to design primer pairs for single—fragment analyses
(Brodin et 61]., 2013). However, with the increased abilities of
next—generation sequencing (NGS) a need to design optimal mul—
tiple—fragment analyses, such as tiled fragments that cover entire
small genomes, has rapidly emerged.

Many previous primer design software have focused on special
purposes such as multiplexing, degenerate sites, discriminate ampli-
fication, nested PCR, single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) proto—
cols, and hybridization analyses such as micro—arrays and in situ
hybridization, and DNA sequencing (Fredslund et 61]., 2006;
Giegerich et 61]., 1996; Kalendar et 61]., 2011; Rouillard et 61]., 2003;
Rychlik 2007; Untergasser et 61]., 2012; Vallone and Butler, 2004;
WeckX et 61]., 2005). More generic software, such as Primer3
(Untergasser et 61]., 2012), base their design on a single sequence,
which inadvertently could place primers in more variable regions,
leading to annealing failure with some templates or selective amplifi—
cation in diverse populations.

Motivated by the large genetic diversity found in Human immuno-
deficiency virus (HIV) and Simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV), and
the need for a generic design tool that could dynamically optimize pri-
mers across their genomes, we developed PrimerDesign—M. It can be
used to design single— or multiple—fragment primers to any aligned set
of DNA sequences, regardless of diversity level and organism.

2 Overview of PrimerDesign-m

2.1 Input

The input consists of a multiple—alignment and user—specified primer
design criteria, uploaded and entered into a web interface. The
alignment can either be user provided or directly imported from the
premade HIV or SIV gene or genome alignments available at the Los
Alamos HIV sequence database. To avoid placing primers in gappy
regions, gaps may be removed at a user—provided cut—off.

The user selects a region of interest (ROI), which defines the part
of the alignment that must be covered by the primers. Note that the
alignment must be longer than the ROI so that flanking primers can
be designed. Next, the user chooses whether a single pair or multiple
pairs of primers should cover the ROI. Adaptors can be added, and
expected experimental read lengths are defined. If multiple-primer
design is selected, five different design options become available:
Max for maximum overlap between fragments, useful when one
wants to ensure contig coverage even when some fragments may
fail, Mid for a ‘tiled’ fragment design, Min for minimum overlap,
Zero for no overlap, i.e. 3’—primers are reused as 5’—primers in next
fragment and Flex for moving across the ROI placing forward pri-
mers in positions with as low as possible entropy scores anywhere
within the previous fragment.

DNA barcode tags can be added, optimizing either number of
tags, tag length or tag edit distance. Additional design options in-
clude primer lengths, primer detection limit (design inclusion of
degenerated primer sites to cover genetic diversity), complexity limit
(maximum number of primer species caused by degenerated sites),
maximum difference in Tm between primers, G/C clamps and dimer—
ization risk [dimer window size to be considered, and maximum
ratio of matched nucleotides within the dimer window; the default
dimerization values are based on experimental results (Desmarais
et 61]., 2012)]. The dimerization test includes all possible homo— and
hetero-dimer formations, including hairpin structures. Tm’s are cal—
culated using the empirical nearest neighbour model (SantaLucia
et 61]., 1996). For designs that may take more than a minute to
design, the user inputs a mail—back email address.

All input options have a link that explains parameter definitions
and value ranges. As usual in HIV database tools, we also provide
example input to test run the tool.

2.2 Output
The output consists of a summary of design criteria, one or several
design graphic representations (depending on if single- or multiple-
fragment design was chosen), tables with primer designs, and
download options for graphics, tables, gap—stripped alignment and
dimerization test logs. We provide five alternative primer pairs per
fragment to allow troubleshooting and potential alternatives, should
one set experimentally fail. The list of primer pairs is ordered by
least entropy among primers that fulfill all design criteria. This
should make it easy to continue with an otherwise successful design.
Graphics are available in png, pdf and jpg formats, and tables can
be downloaded in txt format to be read by spreadsheet or database
programs. For multiple- fragment design, a summary graphic shows
the overall design including the ROI and the locations of the first al—
ternative set of primers per fragment, curves for entropy, complexity
and Tm (Fig. 1).

If mail—back was used, the link to the results stays active for
4 days. If the design fails at some point during multiple-fragment op-
timization, the output will still show successful fragment design up
until the failed fragment. This should allow the user to modify the

of the genome of HIV-1 subtype G. The X-axis shows alignment position
according to the original input multiple alignment, and y-axes show entropy
(green), complexity (red, log scale), and Tm (blue). The grey region is the
user-specified ROI. Primer pairs for each designed fragment are displayed as
green (forward) and red (reverse) arrowheads

design criteria that can cover the whole ROI or define a new ROI
for the remaining sequence.

2.3 Example of use

Figure 1 shows a potential walking-primer design to amplify/
sequence HIV—1 subtype G. Here, we used the HIV database ‘web
alignment’ of 2013, and a ROI in positions 2000—7000 with gaps
removed if more frequent than 50% in any alignment column. We
used the Flex fragment overlap option as we wanted to make sure
primers sit in regions with as low diversity as possible given other
constraints, especially read length; we wanted to use custom
sequencing adaptors (‘My adaptor’ input was M13 forward
adaptor CGCCAGGGTTTTCCCAGTCACGAC and reverse adap—
tor AGCGGATAACAATTTCACACAGGA); an expected read
length 300—400 nt; no barcode tags; and default settings otherwise
(minimum primer length : 20, maximum primer length = 25, detec—
tion limit : 5%, complexity limit: 32, maximum difference in
Tm:5°C, dimer window size=10, dimer max ratio:0.9, G/C
clamp on forward and reverse primers).

The design resulted in 21 fragments 300—400 nt long covering
the ROI, which was modified to positions 1242—6032 when gaps
were removed. The resulting gapstripped alignment could be down—
loaded. For each of the 21 fragments a table with five alternative
pairs was provided. It took about 2 min for PrimerDesign-M to com-
plete this design.

3 Conclusion

PrimerDesign-M can design primers for both single fragment ana—
lyses as well as multiple—fragment walking-primer analyses of highly
variable genomes, and the designed primers have been experimen-
tally confirmed to work (Brodin et 61]., 2013; Fischer et 61]., 2010).
PrimerDesign—M should be useful to researchers in all fields of biol—
ogy who need to design DNA primers. To make access easy, guaran—
tee that the latest version of the tool is used and make the program
independent of computer platform, the software is available as a
web tool at the LANL HIV database.

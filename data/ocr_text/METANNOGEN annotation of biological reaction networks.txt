ABSTRACT

Motivation: Semantic annotations of the biochemical entities
constituting a biological reaction network are indispensable to create
biologically meaningful networks. They further heighten efficient
exchange, reuse and merging of existing models which concern
present-day systems biology research more often. Two types of tools
for the reconstruction of biological networks currently exist: (i) several
sophisticated programs support graphical network editing and
visualization. (ii) Data management systems permit reconstruction
and curation of huge networks in a team of scientists including data
integration, annotation and cross-referencing. We seeked ways to
combine the advantages of both approaches.

Results: METANNOGEN, which was previously developed for
network reconstruction, has been considerably improved. From
now on, METANNOGEN provides SBML import and annotation of
networks created elsewhere. This permits users of other network
reconstruction platforms or modeling software to annotate their
networks using METANNOGEN’S advanced information management.
We implemented word-autocompletion, multipattern highlighting,
spell check, brace-expansion and publication management,
and improved annotation, cross-referencing and team work
requirements. Unspecific enzymes and transporters acting on
a spectrum of different substrates are efficiently handled. The
network can be exported in SBML format where the annotations
are embedded in line with the MIRIAM standard. For more comfort,
METANNOGEN may be tightly coupled with the network editor such
that METANNOGEN becomes an additional view for the focused
reaction in the network editor. Finally, METANNOGEN provides local
single user, shared password protected multiuser or public access
to the annotation data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬁrst version of METANNOGEN (Gille et al., 2007) was used
exclusively to reconstruct metabolic networks as in the case of
whole—cell model HEPATONET (Gille et al., 2010). The program

features of this early version are comparable to other programs
like the recently published METNETMAKER (Forth et al., 2010) or
MEMOSys (Pabinger et al., 2011). However, limitations became
apparent with respect to information management, exchange of
networks and representation of unspeciﬁc transport processes
in eukaryotic cells which forced us to substantially improve
METANNOGEN.

2 RESULTS

From all currently available tools for network reconstruction
such as BIOLOGICALNETWORKS CELLDESIGNER, CYTOSCAPE,
METNETMAKER, MEMOSYs, META—ALL, ONDEX, SEMANTICSBML,
SYCAMORE, VAN TED, probably METANNOGEN represents unspeciﬁc
enzymes and transmembrane transport carriers most efﬁciently.
Therefore, it is suitable for compartmentalized metabolic models
of eukaryotic cells where many carriers transport not just one but
several different substrates. To our knowledge, it provides the
most advanced management for information attached to individual
reactions. To use it, modellers do not need to take METANNOGEN as
the primary network reconstruction tool, but can annotate biological
networks created in any other program that provides SBML export.

Importing networks: the METANNOGEN demo session which can
be web-started on the download page automatically contains the
following three large-scale metabolic networks: KEGG (Kanehisa,
2002), RECONl (Duarte et al., 2007) and EHMN. In addition, any
other network given in SBML can be imported either from a local
ﬁle or from online resources. METANNOGEN provides direct access
to the models stored in the BIOMODELS database and JW S online by
model ID. All networks and their annotations can be Viewed using
browsable graphical trees. KEGG provides pathway maps and images
of metabolite structures.

Cross-references between diﬁ‘erent networks: to cross-reference
equivalent reactions from different networks, METANNOGEN deﬁnes
two reactions as identical if they have identical metabolites in the
left and right side of the biochemical equation, irrespectively of
the order. However, different identiﬁer systems hinder automated
workﬁows (Hucka and Le Novere, 2010; Wang et al., 2010). Here,
METANNOGEN works with dictionaries, to synchronize different
metabolite identiﬁer vocabularies and to interchange compounds
assumed to be different due to pH-dependent protonation (e. g.
carbon dioxide versus hydrogen carbonate) or due to different
ontology levels (e.g. a-D-glucose versus D-glucose).

Annotating networks: the user can type annotations or may
provide automatically generated annotations as a list ﬁle. Typing

of complicated reaction and compound names is facilitated by
word-auto-completion and spell check. Any single word or a
group of selected words in an annotation text has a context
menu that exhibits at least two fundamental functions: pattern-
highlighting and forwarding the text to external applications.
Words with special meaning like names or identiﬁers of network
components have additional menu items. For example, the
denoted network component can be spotted in the graphical
pathway maps. The annotation text can also contain certain
expressions that act directly as cross-links for online resources
(POST or GET), annotations or network components. Using STRAP
(http://www.bi0informatics.org/strap/ or http://3d-alignment.eu/),
certain cross-references display results of predictions from amino
acid sequences (Gille et al., 2008). MIRIAM annotations are deﬁned
according to Le Novere et al. (2005).

Simultaneous network design and network annotation: when the
SBML ﬁle changes on hard disk, METANNOGEN will automatically
reload the model. This happens when the new network topology
is exported from another network editor. The workﬁow can be
further stream lined. While the interprogram communication with
another modeling software is already prepared in METANNOGEN,
it will require adaptations of the modeling software at program
code level. The code changes would enable the network editor
to open a METANNOGEN View for the reaction under consideration
to allow editing of annotations. Vice versa, the context menu
in METANNOGEN could provide actions of the other program
for example highlighting the correspondingr graph node. This
mutual interapplication communication has already been tested in
the prerelease of the network modeling environment SYCAMORE
(Weidemann et al., 2008).

Exporting networks: any network created or annotated with
METANNOGEN can be exported in SBML format and, thus, used by
other tools for further topological analysis, Visualization and model
simulation as in FASIMU (Hoppe et al. , 2011) or OPTFLUX. Optionally,
the library LIBSBML (Bornstein et al. , 2008) is used for SBML-export.
The annotations are embedded in the SBML ﬁle in line with the MIRIAM
standard. METANNOGEN is highly customizable and users can easily
implement other standards for their workﬁow.

Team work: as in the network annotation platform SEMANTICSBML
(Krause et al., 2010), annotations are stored independently of
the exported SBML-ﬁle in a METANNOGEN-speciﬁc ﬁle format
either in a local or shared data repository (Fig. 1). Users
can either create a central password protected data store at
http://www.bi0inf0rmatics.org/strap/metannogen/ or they can set up
a central repository on their own web server. If a password-protected
central repository is used, all curators can simultaneously work
on the same project. Loss of data can potentially occur through
concurrent modiﬁcation by two curators. This is prevented by
mechanisms known from modern Wiki systems. Since there is no
access control at dataset level, curators may change text from their
colleagues. However, data deleted in error are not completely lost,
since all data are stored on the client with date and time after each
sess1on.

Simultaneous highlighting of several speciﬁc text patterns in
publication’s abstracts and full texts as well as UNIPROT ﬁles helps
with text mining. It is controlled by lists of text patterns.

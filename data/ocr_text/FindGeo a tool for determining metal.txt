ABSTRACT

Summary: Metals are essential for the structure and function of
many proteins and nucleic acids. The geometrical arrangement of
the atoms that coordinate a metal in a biological macromolecule is
an important determinant of the specificity and role of that metal.
At present, however, this information can be retrieved only from
the literature, which sometimes contains an improper or incorrect
description of the geometry, and often lacks it altogether. Thus, we
developed FindGeo to quickly and easily determine the coordination
geometry of selected, or all, metals in a given structure. FindGeo
works by superimposing the metal-coordinating atoms in the input
structure to a library of templates with alternative ideal geometries,
which are ranked by RMSD to identify the best geometry assignment.
Availability: FindGeo is freely available as a web service and as a
stand-alone program at http://meta|web.cerm.unifi.it/too|s/findgeo/.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well established that some metals are essential for living
organisms (Bertini et al., 2006). A major reason for this is that a
considerable fraction of proteins are metalloproteins (Bertini et al.,
2001). Metals can play diverse roles in metalloproteins, in part,
because proteins are able to form metal—binding sites that modulate
the properties of metals so as to achieve speciﬁc functions (Andreini
et al., 2009, 2011; Holm et al., 1996). The geometric structure is
recognized to be crucial for the speciﬁcity and activity of metal
sites (Lu et al., 2009; Waldron et al., 2009). Metals are also
closely involved in nucleic acid chemistry. Besides being essential
to stabilize the phosphate—sugar backbone of DNA and RNA,
metals serve crucial functions, e.g. in RNA folding and ribozyme
catalysis (Muller, 2010). Nucleic acids can also achieve a remarkable
degree of metal selectivity, which depends, among other factors, on
coordination geometry (Freisinger and Sigel, 2007). In this scenario,
it is perhaps surprising that there is no tool available to determine
the coordination geometry of metals in biological macromolecules
(or in small complexes) with known structure. We thus present
here FindGeo, a tool for this purpose which is freely available
both as a web service and as a stand—alone program. At present,
information on metal coordination geometry can be retrieved only by
exploring the primary literature, which however sometimes contains

an improper or incorrect description of the geometry, and often lacks
it altogether. Therefore, the use of FindGeo will beneﬁt scientists by:
(1) minimizing errors in the assignment of geometries, (2) promoting
a uniform terminology and classiﬁcation of geometries and thus (3)
providing a reliable basis for structure—function relationship studies
where coordination geometry is a relevant parameter.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE PROGRAM

FindGeo is written partly in Fortran 77 and partly in Python.
A sample workﬂow illustrating the use of the web version is
shown in Figure 1. FindGeo takes as input a PDB ﬁle (either
found on a local disk or downloaded from the PDB (Berman
et al., 2000)), which is searched for metals (any or selected
by the user). For each metal, coordinating atoms are identiﬁed
as those closer than a speciﬁed threshold distance (default 2.8
A) to the metal. Speciﬁc elements (default: C and H) can be
excluded from the search for coordinating atoms. Each metal site
is then compared against a library of structural templates with ideal
geometries (Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S1). Depending on
the RMSD values obtained after superposition, the various possible
geometries are tagged as regular, distorted or irregular. The regular
or distorted geometry with the lowest RMSD is taken as the best
estimate of the metal coordination geometry. When all the possible
geometries are tagged as irregular, the geometry is not assigned.
The RMSD—based criteria for tagging geometries are detailed in
Supplementary Material Appendix A. On output, FindGeo produces
a summary text ﬁle and a series of PDB ﬁles containing the metal
site superimposed to each tested geometry. The structural templates
in the library of FindGeo cover the most common geometries for
coordination numbers 2—9, as well as geometries that are derived
from these by leaving one of the coordinating positions empty.
These latter geometries can account for cases where one of the
metal ligands has been overlooked (e. g. a missing water molecule)
and is not present in the native structure. Prior to superposition,
the original coordinates of the metal site are modiﬁed so as to
set all the metal—coordinating atom distances to 3 A, as it is in
the ideal structural templates. To perform superposition, FindGeo
uses a method based on the quatemion parameterization of rotation
in the form developed by Kearsley (1989) and implemented by
Rupp (http://www.ruppweb.org/xray/comp/superpos.htm). In order
for Kearsley’s method to be applied, it is necessary that the atoms
to be superimposed are speciﬁed in advance. In FindGeo, this
requirement is overcome by iteratively applying the algorithm for
all the possible atom—atom pairings, and selecting the pairing for
which the lowest RMSD is obtained.

Fig. 1. Sample workﬂow illustrating the use of FindGeo. In this example,
the geometry of a zinc ion in PDB structure lca2 is determined by a simple
sequence of actions, only four of which (i.e. 1, 5, 6 and 7) are required

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The performance of FindGeo was evaluated on three different data
sets. The ﬁrst set consisted of 10,800 metal sites (300 for each
of the 36 geometries included in the library of FindGeo) that
were artiﬁcially generated by introducing random distortions in the
structural templates with ideal geometries. The second set consisted
of 14,342 high—resolution X—ray structures of metal complexes taken
from the CSD (Allen, 2002). The third set consisted of 136 metal
sites found in protein structures whose geometries were previously
analyzed and are available in the literature (Rulisek and Vondrasek,
1998). The construction of these data sets and the results obtained
using them as input for FindGeo are detailed in Supplementary
Material Appendix B. The results validated the effectiveness and
robustness of the approach implemented in FindGeo, which could be
successfully applied to determine both the well—deﬁned geometries
that are typically observed in small molecules and the less regular
geometries found in metalloproteins. In particular, the 26 sites of
metalloproteins which were assigned a geometry different from that
reported in (Rulisek and Vondrasek, 1998) represent examples of
how FindGeo can be used to revise and improve the information
available in the literature. Possibly, the most conspicuous among
these examples are the assignment of a square pyramidal geometry
(spy) to a cobalt site reported to be trigonal bipyramidal (PDB 1iab)
and, conversely, the assignment of a trigonal bipyramidal geometry
(tbp) to a nickel site reported to be square pyramidal (PDB 1ka,
chain B). These cases illustrate the discriminating power of FindGeo
in challenging cases where two closely related geometries such

as spy and tbp are possible options, and the assignment found in
(Rulisek and Vondrasek, 1998) is wrong. A potential pitfall in the
use of FindGeo is in the interpretation of the geometries with an
empty coordination position. While it is true that such assignments
can be, in many cases, a useful hint to identify a missing ligand,
users must not be misled to believe that every site whose geometry
is described as having a vacant position lacks a ligand (this is indeed
the case for 24 out of 37 sites in the metalloprotein data set). It must
be kept in mind that ideal geometries are only convenient descriptors
of the conﬁguration of the coordinating atoms around the metal,
and the fact that the best descriptor for a site is an ideal geometry
with an empty position does not necessarily imply that a ligand
was overlooked in that site. Also, the geometrical descriptors used
in FindGeo should not be confused with descriptors of structural
symmetry. For example, a truly octahedral complex with all bond
lengths equal and a tetragonally distorted octahedral complex (e. g.
due to Jahn—Teller effect) have 0;, and D4}, symmetry, respectively,
but would both be described by FindGeo as octahedral. Still, the
output PDB ﬁles can be of help to users that wish to investigate
such structural details. Possible large scale applications of FindGeo,
for which the stand—alone program will be most suitable, include,
e.g. the analysis of all metal sites in the PDB or in nucleic acid
databases, such as MINAS (Schnabl et al, 2012), and structure—
function studies of correlations between coordination geometry
and other parameters (e.g. metal function, oxidation state). Also,
FindGeo can be used in protein function prediction in conjunction
with predictors of metal sites such as CHED (Babor et al, 2008).
Finally, FindGeo can be of help in many other ﬁelds where the
knowledge of coordination geometry is relevant, including, e. g.
magnetochemistry and materials science.

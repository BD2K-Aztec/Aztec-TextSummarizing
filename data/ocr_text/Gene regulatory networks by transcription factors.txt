ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene regulatory networks (GRNs) affect numerous cellu-
lar processes and every process of life, and abnormalities of GRN lead
to breast cancer. Transcription factors (T F3) and microRNAs (miRNAs)
are two of the best-studied gene regulatory mechanisms. However,
the architecture and feature of GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast
cancer and its subtypes were unknown. In this study, we investigated
the GRNs by TFs and miRNAs with emphasis on breast cancer clas-
sifier genes at system level.

1 INTRODUCTION

The products of genes encoded by the genome of organism
enable cell survival and many cellular functions (Karlebach
and Shamir, 2008). Regulation of gene expression determines
the amount and the temporal pattern of these products in the
cell that are crucial to the processes of life (Karlebach and
Shamir, 2008). Although there are many layers of gene regula-
tion, transcription factors (TFs) and microRNAs (miRNAs) are
two of the best-studied gene regulatory mechanisms (Chen and
Rajewsky, 2007). TFs regulate gene expression at the transcrip-
tional level, whereas miRNAs, ~22-nuleotide long non-coding
RNAs, regulate gene expression at the post-transcriptional
level (Chen and Rajewsky, 2007). Expression abnormalities of
both coding and non-coding genes were involved in cancer,
which is a complex genetic disease (Calin and Croce, 2006).
Cancer is a leading cause of human death. TFs play important
roles in expression regulation of both coding and non-coding
genes, and at least three main groups of TFs are known to be
important in human cancer (Darnell, 2002). Alterations of
miRNAs are involved in both the initiation and progression of
human cancer, and the link between deregulated miRNAs ex-
pression and cancer had been well established (Calin and Croce,
2006; Garzon et al., 2009; Pencheva and Tavazoie, 2013).
Understanding gene regulatory networks (GRNs) by TFs and

miRNAs will shed light on the mechanisms of cancer, including
breast cancer.

Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women, and ~ 1
million new breast cancer cases were diagnosed each year world-
wide (Liu, 2012). Recent studies provided valuable information
on the molecular mechanism of breast cancer via integrating in-
formation from genome transcriptome to proteome of represen-
tative numbers of breast cancer patient samples (Cancer Genome
Atlas Network, 2012; Ellis et al., 2012; Shah et al., 2012; Yuan
et al., 2012). Gene regulations by TFs and miRNAs have been
linked to breast cancer. Several TFs, e.g. oestrogen receptors, are
known to be important in breast cancer (Darnell, 2002).
MiRNAs, e.g. miR-200 family members, play important roles
in breast cancer (Liu, 2012). However, the architecture and fea-
ture of GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer and its
subtypes were largely unknown.

Breast cancer is a remarkably heterogeneous disease. Breast
cancer cell lines and primary breast tumors were found to be
consistently classiﬁed into three major subtypes: luminal (Lu),
basal A (BaA) and basal B (BaB) (Ellis et al., 2012; Neve et al.,
2006). The breast cancer cell lines were found to compromise a
system exhibiting the substantial genomic, transcriptional and
biological heterogeneity properties of primary breast cancers
(Neve et al., 2006). Breast cancer classiﬁer genes (BCCGs)
involved in the differentiation status of the cell type and/or
tumor biology were identified to be able to classify breast
cancer cell lines into Lu, BaA and BaB groups (Neve et al.,
2006). Investigating the pattern and feature of GRNs composed
of TFs, miRNAs and BCCGs in breast cancer cell lines will
provide valuable information for understanding the molecular
mechanism of gene regulation in breast cancer and the molecular
basis of breast cancer subtypes.

In this study, we revealed the architecture and feature of
GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer via systematically
investigating GRNs composed of TFs, miRNAs and BCCGs
across 33 breast cancer cell lines representing three major
breast cancer subtypes (Lu, BaA and BaB). First, TFs,
miRNAs and BCCGs were collected from public database and
published works, and the relationships among them were ana-
lyzed via computational methods combined with gene expression
data. Second, for each breast cancer subtype, the correlation
between TFs/miRNAs and their targets was calculated. After
that, enrichment of miRNA target gene in BCCGs was analyzed,

and feature of GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer at
system level.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection

All human miRNAs and their conserved predicted targets were down-
loaded from TargetScan Human V6.2 (http://www.targetscan.org)
(Friedman et al., 2009). The expression data of breast cancer cell lines
were collected based on previous works, and the procedure was described
as follows. mRNA expression and miRNA expression data of human
breast cancer cell lines were collected from the studies by Richard M.
Neve et al. (2006) and Muhammad Riaz et a]. (2013), respectively. Thirty-
three breast cancer cell lines with both mRNA and miRNA expression

data were used for further analysis. These 33 cell lines cover three breast
cancer subtypes: Lu, BaA and BaB (Supplementary Table S1). In all, 305
probes that were ﬁltered by PAM analysis and used to classify subtypes
of breast cancer were derived from the published data (Neve et al., 2006;
Tibshirani et al., 2002). These probes were mapped to 264 genes as
BCCGs by ‘Gene ID Conversion’ in the DAVID Web server (Huang
et al., 2008). The TFs, conserved TF binding sites (TFBSs) and transcrip-
tion start sites (TSSs) were obtained from the UCSC Table Browser
(Kent at al., 2002). The TSSs of miRNAs were downloaded from
miRstart database (Chien et al., 2011).

2.2 MRNA and TF target prediction

MiRNA targets (including TFs and BCCGs with Pet 20.8) were gener-
ated using TargetScan (Friedman et al., 2009). TF target genes were
identiﬁed using the approach developed by Poos and his colleagues
(Poos et al., 2013), via deﬁning the :l:2000 bp sequence around TSSs as
the promoter region. The genes with promoter regions completely over-
lapped with TFBSs were considered as TF targets.

2.3 Correlation and enrichment analysis

Pearson correlation was used to estimate the relation between miRNAs,
TFs and BCCGs. TFs were assumed to promote the expression of their
targets, whereas miRNAs were assumed to inhibit the expression of
their targets. Therefore, TFs expressions have positive correlations with
their target genes (r 2 0.3), and miRNAs expressions have negative cor-
relations with their target genes (r 5 —0.3).

In miRstart, the TSS of an intragenic miRNA is the same as its host
gene by default. However, not all of these miRNAs share their TSS with
their host genes (Ozsolak et al., 2008). In this study, a TF was considered
to regulate an intragenic miRNA when the expression of TF has positive
correlation with the host gene of the miRNA (r 2 0.3).

Furthermore, we evaluated the signiﬁcant relationship between the
expression of miRNAs and BCCGs via enrichment analysis to restrict
the target relations. The enrichment analysis was executed for each
miRNA individually. Hyper geometric test was performed to assess the
enrichment of miRNA target genes in BCCGs. Multiple-test correction
was also performed to control the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995). MiRNAs with signiﬁcant enrichment in BCCGs
were used for further analysis (P: 0.05 and FDR 50.05).

2.4 Co-regulatory motifs and co-regulatory networks
analysis

TF-miRNA-BCCG GRNs were constructed for three subtypes of breast
cancer based on correlated relationships among miRNAs, TFs and target
genes. 3-node motifs were detected by FANMOD software, and two
types of co-regulatory motif were ﬁltered out from the dumping results
(Wernicke and Rasche, 2006). The co-regulatory motif is deﬁned as that
in which a TF and a miRNA share a common target gene and regulate
each other in 3-node motif. The GRNs for three breast cancer subtypes
(Lu, BaA and BaB) were constructed separately.

To evaluate the signiﬁcance of co-regulatory motifs in different GRNs,
we compared them with those of random networks. To fully randomize a
network, each edge in a network was exchanged ﬁve times via changing
edges with same regulatory relationship among miRNAs, TFs and target
genes. In a random network, the number of target genes by a TF or a
miRNA and the number of TFs or miRNAs targeting a gene remains
unchanged. The random networks were constructed 1000 times and com-
pared with original networks. The P—values were computed to estimate
the signiﬁcance of co-regulatory motifs in real networks.

3-node loop motifs were merged to construct GRNs in breast cancer
and breast cancer subtypes. In the GRNs, three nodes represent miRNA,
TF and BCCG, while two edges represent activation and inhibition

relation. The GRNs were visualized and analyzed by Cytoscape 3.0.2
(Smoot et al., 2011). To evaluate the importance of nodes, we calculated
the degrees and betweenness centrality of each node in each network by
Cytoscape 3.0.2. The degree for a node is deﬁned as the number of con-
nections it has to other nodes. The betweenness centrality for a node is
the number of shortest paths from all vertices to all others that pass
through the node. The Venn and the Euler diagrams were used as a
plug-in of Cytoscape to compare GRNs of three breast cancer subtypes
(Wilkinson, 2012). The common and speciﬁc nodes and edges in networks
among the three breast cancer subtypes were analyzed. To estimate
whether the intersections of GRNs have biological relationship or just
random overlap, signiﬁcant tests were performed for the intersections
among the three GRNs using network analysis tools (Brohée et al., 2008).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Identiﬁcation of miRNA and TF target genes in the
BCCGs

There are 170 of 264 BCCGs targeted by 255 miRNAs and 146
TFs (Supplementary Table S2). In all, 4373 TF-regulating-
BCCGs, 1352 miRNA-regulating-BCCGs, 3440 TF-regulating-
miRNAs and 2357 miRNA-regulating—TFs pairs were identiﬁed
(Supplementary Table S2).

The expression of 209 of 255 miRNAs was found to correlate
with their target genes at r§—0.3 (BaA:l43; BaB:l6l; Lu:123)
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S4). In addition, 140 miRNAs are
signiﬁcantly enriched in the BCCGs (P3005 & FDR§0.05)
(BaA:104; BaB:111; Lu:9l) (Supplementary Table S5).

In 146 TFs, 129 TFs targeting 160 BCCGs have expression
data across the 33 breast cancer cell lines (Supplementary Table
S3). Six genes belong to both TFs and BCCGs (50x9, Gata3,
Eer, Fosl], X bp] and Pbe). The expression of all 129 TFs was
found to be associated to their target genes at r 2 0.3 level (BaA:
129; BaB: 126; Lu: 125) (Supplementary Table S4). What’s more,
129 TFs were associated with 78 miRNAs using 74 BCCGs as
their host genes at r 2 0.3 level (Supplementary Table S6).

3.2 The gene regulatory motifs feature of GRNs by TFs
and miRNAs in breast cancer

The basal subtype (BaA and BaB) has signiﬁcantly more nodes
and edges in co-regulatory motif group than the luminal subtype
(Lu). BaB contains 70 nodes and 171 edges, BaA contains 58
nodes and 140 edges, whereas Lu contains only 41 nodes and
85 edges (Table l and Supplementary Table S7). When

'IF:

TF-miRNA—BCCG GRNs were constructed using interaction
data of the three subtypes of breast cancer, two types of gene
regulatory motifs (GRMs) were detected (Fig. 2). Type I GRM is
where a TF and a miRNA pair share a commonly regulated
target gene which is a BCCG, and Type II GRM is where a
TF and a miRNA pair commonly regulates another TF. Both
Type I and II GRMs were observed in all breast cancer subtypes.
Compared with random networks, type II GRM in BaB and Lu
was signiﬁcant (P g 0.05) (Table 1). This might be owing to regu-
latory motif that is usually apparent at the hierarchy of TFs
rather than other genes.

3.3 The architecture and feature of GRNs by TF and
miRNA in breast cancer

To study the architecture and feature of GRNs by TF and
miRNA in breast cancer, for each breast cancer subtypes,
GRNs were created via joining all the 3-node co-regulatory
motifs (Figs 3—5) and merged the three co-regulatory networks
into an entire network (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2).

The co-regulatory networks of each breast cancer subtypes
clearly exhibit a small number of hubs (Figs 3—5). The most

connected nodes with :10 connected genes are suggested to be
hub genes in the co-regulatory networks. In the co-regulatory
network of BaA, we identiﬁed four hub genes: POU2F1,
hsa—mir-29c, hsa-mir-l9a and hsa—mir-l30a, which were con-
nected to 34, l2, l2 and 11 genes, respectively (Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Table S8). In comparison to the co-regulatory
network of BaA, the co-regulatory network of BaB contains
four identical hubgeneszPOU2Fl, hsa—mir-29c, hsa-mir-l9a and
hsa—mir-l30a connected to 33, 17, 10 and 10 genes, respectively
(Fig. 4 and Supplementary Table S8). Although POU2Fland
hsa—mir-l30a were also observed to be the only two hub genes
in the co-regulatory network of Lu, the number of connected
genes of POU2F1 is only 10, which is dramatically less than
that in BaA (33) and BaB (34) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary
Table S8). These results explain at least in part the less different
biological and clinical behaviors between BaA and BaB than

those between basal (BaA and BaB) and luminal (Lu) breast
cancer.

Node degrees and betweenness centrality parameters were fur-
ther calculated to evaluate the contribution of each node in three
networks, respectively (Supplementary Table S8). Although the
co-regulatory network of BaA and BaB shared the four hub
genes, the connected genes of these hub genes were not the
same. For example, 10 of 22 POU2F1 target genes were different
between the co-regulatory networks of BaA and BaB (Figs 3 and
4, Supplementary Table S8). In addition, in BaA, POU2F1 were
regulated by 12 genes including 4 genes only present in BaA and
not in BaB, whereas in BaB, POU2F1 were regulated by 11 genes
including 3 genes only present in BaB and not in BaA (Figs 3 and
4, Supplementary Table S8). These results together indicated that
although BaA and BaB shared the common hub genes in their
GRNs, they differ from each other via connecting to different
genes to form subtype-speciﬁc GRNs, which are relevant to the
different biological and clinical behaviors between BaA and BaB.

Beside the hub genes, we further explored the common gene
nodes among breast cancer subtypes. Although 18 common
nodes including POU2F1 and hsa-mir-l30a are found among
Lu, BaA and BaB, signiﬁcant variations were found in the
nodes among BaA, BaB and Lu (Fig. 6). There are 37 intersec-
tion nodes between two basal breast cancer subtypes (BaA and
BaB), whereas only 21 intersection nodes were found between Lu
and BaA and 26 intersection nodes were found between Lu and
BaB (Fig. 6). The intersection nodes between basal subtypes are
signiﬁcantly higher than those found between basal subtypes and
luminal subtype (Fig. 6). In addition, only 12 nodes were found
in Lu GRN, only 18 nodes were found in BaA GRN and only 25
nodes were found in BaB GRN (Fig. 6 and Table 2).

When the edges in the GRNs of each breast cancer subtypes
were compared, common and unique edges were identiﬁed (Fig.
7, Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 and Supplementary Table
S10).Twenty-one common edges were found among BaA, BaB
and Lu. There are 30 intersection edges between the two basal
breast cancer subtypes (BaA and BaB), whereas only 10 inter-
section edges were found between Lu and BaA and 12 intersec-
tion edges were found between Lu and BaB (Fig. 7). BaA, BaB
and Lu contain 79, 108, and 42 subtype-speciﬁc edges (Fig. 7,
Supplementary Table S10). Compared with variation nodes of
different breast cancer subtypes, the variation edges are much

results suggested that both nodes and edges contribute to the
different biological and clinical behaviors of breast cancer
subtypes.

The intersection edges among GRNs are statistically signiﬁ-
cantly (P<0.01) (Fig. 8). This result indicated that the differ-
ences on nodes and edges among GRNs of three breast cancer
subtypes reﬂect the molecular basis under breast tumorigenesis
and breast cancer subtyping.

4 DISCUSSION

Numerous cellular processes and every process of life are affected
by GRNs (Karlebach and Shamir, 2008). Precise and coordi-
nated control of gene expression is required for an organism to

grow, develop and function normally.(Cox and Goding, 1991). It
is known for decades that a failure of normal regulation of ex-
pression of genes in cell growth and differentiation leads to the
appearance and behavior of cancer cells (Cox and Goding, 1991).
Abnormities in GRNs causing gene expression abnormities play
important roles in human cancer including breast cancer. Breast
cancer is one of the most commonly diagnosed cancer types in
the world and is one of the most investigated areas of oncology
(Demicheli and Coradini, 2011). Although there are >100 000
published papers on breast cancer in the past decade and
GRNs were claimed to be a new conceptual framework to ana-
lyze breast cancer behaviors (Demicheli and Coradini, 2011), the
study on the architecture and the feature of the GRNs in breast
cancer is still limited.

GRNs can provide explanations of developmental and physio-
logical functions at system level (Davidson, 2010). GRNs contain
many layers of gene regulation, including cell signaling; mRNA
splicing, polyadenylation and localization; chromatin modiﬁca-
tions; and mechanisms of protein localization, modiﬁcation and
degradation (Chen and Rajewsky, 2007). TFs and miRNAs are
two of the best-studied gene regulatory mechanism (Chen and
Rajewsky, 2007). TFs are considered as key intrinsic regulators
of cell fate via controlling gene expression directly (Demicheli
and Coradini, 2011). Compared with TFs that regulate gene ex-
pression at the level of transcriptional regulation, miRNAs regu-
late gene expression at post-transcriptional level and raised
entirely new mechanisms of gene regulation. More than 60%
of human protein-coding genes were predicted to be regulated
by miRNAs (Friedman et al., 2009). Thus, investigation on
GRNs by TFs and miRNAs will provide valuable information
for understanding the gene regulation mechanism of cancer,
including breast cancer.

In breast cancer, GRNs by TFs have been the subject of in-
tense scientiﬁc investigation over the past several decades, and
the related studies also lead to the improvement of breast cancer
treatment. Take oestrogen receptor-or (ESRl), which is one of the
most extensively studied TFs in breast cancer, as an example.
ESRl is found to be the driving TF in majority of breast cancer
and to target genes dictating cell growth and endocrine responses

(Ross-Innes et al., 2012). The studies on ESRl and its GRNs
lead to the development of hormone therapy, which is the mainly
current systemic therapy (Bedard et al., 2013). Recent techno-
logical advances improve the genome-wide map of GRN by
ESRl from model systems to breast cancer (Carroll et al.,
2006; Lin et al., 2007; Ross-Innes et al., 2012; Welboren et al.,
2009). Compared with TFs, miRNAs, which are short (20—23
nucleotides) regulatory RNAs that cause destabilization or trans-
lational repression of target mRNAs, are rising to be important
new mechanisms of gene regulation in breast cancer (Le Quesne
and Caldas, 2010). It has been mostly investigated on the role of
individual miRNAs in breast cancer, and a new framework for
studying the biology of miRNAs in breast cancer was presented
recently via analyzing the miRNA expression proﬁles of 1302
breast tumors with matching detailed clinical annotation, long-
term follow-up and genomic and miRNA expression data
(Dvinge et al., 2013).

Several studies have demonstrated the regulation between TFs
and miRNAs in breast cancer. For examples, c-MYC directly
transacted the miR-I7—92 cluster to modulate E2f1 expression in
breast cancer (O’Donnell et al., 2005), and miR-221/222 directly
target Eer mRNA to function in tamoxifen resistance in breast
cancer (Zhao et al., 2008). However, little is known on the pat-
tern and features of GRNs by TFs and miRNA in breast cancer.
Besides TargetScan, >10 integrative approaches have been de-
veloped for miRNA target prediction (Naifang et al., 2013). In
these approaches, approaches including MMIA (Nam et al.,
2009), mirConnX (Huang et al., 2011) and MAGIA (Sales
et al., 2010) were correlation-based approaches, which directly
consider the correlation between miRNA and mRNA expres-
sion. Besides correlation-based approaches, linear mode
approaches, including GenmiR++ (Huang et al., 2007) and
Bayesian network approach (Liu et al., 2009) predict miRNA
target via formulating mRNA and miRNA expression with
linear model with latent variables, and via using Bayesian net-
work to model the miRNA—mRNA regulatory network, respect-
ively. Regarding to the TFs and their targets, many approaches
and databases, including UCSC database (Kent et al., 2002),
have been developed. However, none of these was able to be
directly applied for analyzing GRN by miRNA and TF. To in-
vestigate the GRNs by the miRNA and the TF in breast cancer
and among breast cancer subtypes, a pipeline shown in Figure 1
was designed to integrate the established approaches from
miRNA target prediction to transcription targets analysis to de-
cipher the architecture and features of GRNs consisted of
miRNAs, TF and BCCGs in breast cancer and among breast
cancer subtypes. There are two types of GRMs in breast cancer:
Type I and Type II GRMs (Fig. 2). All the three breast cancer
subtypes (BaA, BaB and Lu) have the two GRM types with
signiﬁcant variation number of nodes and edges (Fig. 2 and
Supplementary Table S7). Basal subtype (BaA andBaB) has sig-
niﬁcantly more nodes and edges in co-regulatory motif group
than luminal subtype (Lu) (Table 1, Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table S7). To study the combinatorial regulation pattern of
GRNs by miRNAs and TFs in breast cancer, for each breast
cancer subtypes, the GRNs by miRNAs and TFs were created
via joining all 3-node co-regulatory motifs and merged three
co-regulatory networks into the entire GRNs (Figs 3—5 and
Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The number of intersection

nodes and edges between BaA and BaB is much higher than
that between Lu and BaA and between Lu and BaB (Figs 6
and 7). Different breast cancer subtypes have their unique
nodes and edges (Table 2 and Supplementary Tables S9
and S10). These features support the signiﬁcant differences be-
tween breast cancer subtypes on many aspects from molecule to
prognosis to some extent. Interestingly, a much smaller gene list
containing only protein coding gene nodes from the GRNs is
able to classify breast cancer subtypes as efﬁcient as the gene
list containing all BCCGs (Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).
This result indicates that it might be potentially used analysis
of the architecture and features of the GRNs in breast cancer
and among breast cancer subtypes to build a more accurate and
efﬁcient breast subtype discriminator. Interestingly, most
common nodes are TFs or miRNAs. This might be the conse-
quence of restriction to BCCGs as TFs and miRNA targets in
current study. Further studies would be required to conﬁrm
whether this phenomenon is a feature of breast cancer.
Identiﬁcation of breast cancer driver genes will lay the ground
for developing new diagnostics and individualizing cancer treat-
ment. In the GRNs by TFs and miRNAs, 18 genes were
common in GRNs across all breast cancer subtypes and desig-
nated non—subtype-speciﬁc genes (NSG) (Fig. 6). Nine of these
18 NSGs are TFs. In the nine TFs, eight (CREBl, ESRl,
FOSLl, PBXl, POU2F1, SOX9, SP1 and ZEBl) were reported
to play roles in breast cancer. CREBl was reported to be a
positive transcription regulator of aromatase (Soﬁ et al., 2003),
and its expression was correlated with the prognosis of breast
cancer (Chhabra et al., 2007). ESRl roles in breast cancer were
well established (Dumas and Diorio, 2011). FOSLl was found to
modulate growth, vacuolization and death of ant estrogen-resist-
ant MCF-7 cells (Pennanen et al., 2011). PBXl, Pre-B-cell leu-
kemia homeobox l, was reported to act as a TF to function as a
pioneer factor deﬁning aggressive Era-positive breast cancer
(Magnani et al., 2011). POU2F1 was found to be a hub gene
in GRNs across all breast cancer subtypes (Figs 3—5 and
Supplementary Table S8). POU2F1, octamer TF 1 (OCTl), is
reported to be associated with epithelial-mesenchymal transition
(EMT) and breast tumor malignancy (Hwang-Verslues et al.,
2013). SOX9 was recently reported to cooperate with SLUG to
determine the mammary stem cell state (Guo et al., 2012). SP1
was reported to interact with ESRl and play important roles in
breast cancer (Ando and Catalano, 2012; Kim et al., 2005).
ZEBl was reported to control proliferation and epithelial-to-
mesenchymal transition of breast cancer cells (Hugo et al.,
2013). Besides the eight TFs in NSGs as discussed above, little
is known about roles of ANK3 and POU3F2 in breast cancer,
and Ank3and P0u3f2 are considered to be new breast cancer gene
candidates. In comparison, the eight miRNAs in NSGs are much
less studied. Only two miRNAs in NSGs were reported to play
roles in breast cancer: has-mir-IS’Oa was recently reported to
modulate Hoxa5, which is a critical mediator of a breast
cancer chemoprevention agent retinoic acid-induced cell growth
inhibition (Yang et al., 2013a), and has-mir—IQa was found to
target Pten to play a role in breast cancer chemoresistance
(Liang et al., 2011) and regulate the expression of tissue factor,
which is an important regulator of tumor angiogenesis and me-
tastasis in both luminal and basal breast cancer cells
(Tsopanoglou and Maragoudakis, 2007; Zhang et al., 2011).

The remaining six miRNAs (has-mir-195, has-mir-200c, hsa-mir—
543, hsa—rnir—300, hsa—mir-38I and hsa—rnir—29c) in NSGs are new
miRNAs that could be play roles in breast cancer. Besides NSGs,
the remaining genes were designated as breast cancer subtype-
related genes (SRGs) (Fig. 3 and Table 2). Although SRGs
cannot be simply interpreted as breast cancer subtype-speciﬁc
genes whose functions are limited to speciﬁc breast cancer sub-
types, SRGs would also play roles in breast cancer, and further
studies are needed to validate whether the functions of SRGs in
breast cancer are highly depended on the context of breast cancer
subtypes. MiRNA regulatory networks were found to alter their
conﬁguration to conform to the stable TF regulatory networks
with an increased circuit redundancy, and a marked reduction in
the repertoire of composite feed-forward circuits targeted genes
and this redundancy-adding role is preferentially attributable
(Iwama et al., 2011). Although it is difﬁcult to compile human
breast cancers to other mammals including mice to study evolu-
tion of related GRNs, our GRNs by TFs and miRNAs in breast
cancer and subtypes might be likely to retain similar properties.
Further investigations are required to verify whether the redun-
dancy-adding role would serve as a niche for many miRNA con-
nections to survive avoiding conﬂicts with the stable TF
regulatory networks in breast cancer.

More importantly, the GRNs raise important clues for further
functional validation the GRNs by certain TFs and miRNAs
and facilitate profound understanding of the functions of
breast cancer genes. Several regulatory relationships have been
experimentally validated. For example, a recent study showed
that microRNA-34 directly targets FoslI to suppress breast
cancer invasion and metastasis (Yang et al., 2013b). Thus, our
results give important clue for the experimental validation of
GRNs in breast cancer.

Our results reveal that the architecture and feature of GRNs
by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer have both distinct and
common features among breast cancer subtypes. In addition,
our results raise abundant clues for further experimental investi-
gation of gene regulation by TFs and miRNAs in breast cancer
via providing the new candidate breast cancer genes and regula-
tory relationship. Taken together, our results shed light on the
mechanism of breast cancer development and subtyping.

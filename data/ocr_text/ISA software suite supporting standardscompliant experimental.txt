1 HIGH-THROUGHPUT OMICS STUDIES

The development of high—throughput genomic and post—genomic
(hereafter, ‘omics’) technologies entails changes in the handling,
processing and sharing of data (Schoﬁeld et al., 2009). Omics
datasets are often complex and rich in context. Studies may run
material through several kinds of assay, using both omics and
other technologies; for example, studying the effect of a compound
on rat liver through transcriptome, proteome and metabolome
proﬁling (using high—throughput sequencing and two kinds of
mass spectrometry, respectively) alongside conventional analyses
(e.g. histopathology). Such data must be accompanied by enough
contextual information (i.e. metadata; sample characteristics,
technology and measurement types; instrument parameters and
sample—to—data relationships) to make datasets comprehensible and
reusable if they are to underpin future investigations.

Many funders and journals require that researchers share data,
and encourage the enrichment and standardization of experimental
metadata (Field at al., 2009). Consequently, more and richer studies
are ﬂowing into public databases. However, two bottlenecks can
signiﬁcantly hamper this process, necessitating urgent solutions.
First, international public repositories for ‘omics data such as
GEO (Barrett et al., 2009), ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2009),
PRIDE (Vizcaino et al., 2010), ENA, SRA and DRA (Shumway
et al., 2010), have their own submission formats, data models and
terminologies, created for speciﬁc types of assay. This complicates
the submission process for researchers producing multi—assay
studies (and greatly increases the risk that these datasets become
irrevocably fragmented). Secondly, the shortage of curators to
check and annotate submissions to public repositories—a situation
unlikely to change soon—necessitates better annotation at source (by
experimentalists or community—based efforts; Howe et al., 2008).
Free software, with automated content validation, is required to
facilitate the collection, management and curation of a variety of
study inhouse, and to format those data for submission to public
repositories. Such software should support community—deﬁned
reporting standards, such as the minimum information checklists
listed by the MIBBI Portal (Taylor et al., 2007), and ontologies,
(Cote et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2007; Noy et al., 2009).

The Investigation/Study/Assay (ISA) infrastructure described
here is the ﬁrst general—purpose format and freely available
desktop software suite designed to regularize local management of
experimental metadata by enabling curation at source, supporting
community—deﬁned reporting standards and preparing studies for
submission to public repositories.

2 THE ISA FORMAT AND SOFTWARE SUITE

The software suite comprises ﬁve platform—independent J ava—based
software components for local use, including a relational database
(Fig. 1), built around the ISA—Tab format. The components work

both as stand—alone applications and as a uniﬁed system to assist
in the local management and storage of experimental metadata, and
to facilitate data submission to international public repositories. All
components run as ‘desktop’ applications; in addition, the database
component features a web—based query interface.

2.1 ISA-Tab: an extensible, cross-domain format

‘Investigation’, ‘Study’ and ‘Assay’ are the three key entities
around which the general—purpose ISA—Tab format for structuring
and communicating metadata is built (Sansone et al., 2008).
Investigation contains all the information needed to understand
the overall goals and means used in an experiment; Study is the
central unit, containing information on the subject under study, its
characteristics and any treatments applied. Each Study has associated
Assay( s ), producing qualitative or quantitative data, deﬁned by the
type of measurement (i.e. gene expression) and the technology
employed (i.e. high—throughput sequencing). The hierarchical
structure of ISA—Tab enables the representation of studies employing
one or a combination of omics and other technologies, overcoming
the fragmentation of the existing submission formats built for
speciﬁc types of assay. To ensure conversion, ISA—Tab has been
designed with reference to these existing ‘omics formats (Jones
et al., 2007), complementing and extending their work where
necessary; for example, it shares both syntax and the use of easily—
manipulable tab—delimited text ﬁles with ArrayExpress’ MAGE—Tab
(Rayner et al., 2006). Additionally, where omics—based technologies
are used in clinical or non—clinical studies, ISA—Tab complements
existing biomedical formats such as the Study Data Tabulation
Model (http://www.cdisc.org/sdtm), endorsed by the US Food
and Drug Administration. ISA—Tab also complements the XML
formats used by the PRIDE, ENA, SRA and DRA repositories, and
consequently offers a way to render their experimental metadata
documents in a more user—friendly format. Note though that ISA—
Tab is simply a format; the decision on how to regulate its use (i.e.
enforcing the ﬁlling of required ﬁelds, or the use of ontologies)
is left to local administrators’ use of ISA software components, or
the growing number of other systems and groups implementing the
format (e.g. Krestyaninova et al., 2009; SysMO—DB http://www
.sysmo—db.org/community; XperimentR, http://www.imperial.ac
.uk/bioinfsupport/resources/data_management/; more given on the
ISA web site).

2.2 ISAcreator: a user-friendly editor

This desktop application enables users (i.e. experimentalists)
to compile experimental metadata sets, and to import and
edit existing ISA—Tab formatted ﬁles. It breaks down overall
descriptions into relatively simple parts, uses graphical abstraction
to enable visualization of the information described and facilitates
time—efﬁcient description of experimental steps by remembering
prior behaviour (through user proﬁles). ISAcreator’s aesthetically
pleasing interface makes extensive use of Java Swing and external
open source libraries (e.g. Prefuse, http://prefuse.org/). The editor
uses a style of form— and spreadsheet—based data entry that is likely
to be familiar to researchers, augmenting basic functionality such as
‘auto—ﬁll’ and ‘undo’ with advanced features, listed below.

2.2.] Ontology support A dedicated ‘widget’ allows ontology
terms to be searched for and inserted in real time via the BioPortal
(Noy et al., 2009) and the Ontology Lookup Service (Cote
et al., 2006). Terms from those sources are imported along with
core metadata (identiﬁers, deﬁnitions and ontology version); term
selection is facilitated by a search history displaying prior choices
(through user proﬁles).

2.2.2 Design wizard An alternative way for users to enter
information that leverages common patterns to reduce repetitive
tasks by guiding users through a series of questions that elicit
information about the design of the Study and associated Assay( s ).

2.2.3 Spreadsheet import As a second alternative, this widget
enables the mapping and import of information from existing
spreadsheets; also the reformatting and reannotation of legacy data.

2.2.4 Data ﬁle chooser This widget appends data ﬁles located
either local to the operator, or identiﬁed by FTP on a remote
system, to an experimental metadata sets. Upon completion of a valid
investigation report, ISAcreator outputs a compressed ‘ISArchive’
containing the ISA—Tab—formatted metadata and either the actual
data ﬁles, or a reference to them, if necessary (e. g. because of their
large size), consisting of their address and ﬁle name.

2.3 ISAconﬁgurator: standards-compliant templates

This desktop application allows ‘power users’ (i.e. community
curators) to customize the ﬁelds displayed by ISAcreator, and for
example, to meet the requirements of one or more MIBBI minimum
information checklists by declaring certain ﬁelds mandatory, or
by specifying allowed values (e.g. drawn from a set of ontology
terms, or formatted in a speciﬁc manner). Conﬁguration ﬁles from
ISAconﬁgurator are read by ISAcreator, which then generates
interface components as required.

2.4 ISAvalidator: adherence to templates

This desktop application also reads conﬁguration ﬁles and checks
both that completed ISA—Tab ﬁles meet speciﬁed requirements and
that associated data ﬁles have been linked. Whether ISA—Tab ﬁles
are created with ISAcreator or another way (e. g. with spreadsheet
software), ISAvalidator checks that the document is syntactically
correct and internally consistent, and reports on errors (i.e. missing
or incorrect values).

2.5 Biolnvestigation Index: local storage

An ISArchive provides a simple way to store and share information
in a structured manner, but those tasks are better performed by
uploading such a ﬁle to an instance of our ‘BioInvestigation Index’
(BII), or another system that implements ISA—Tab import. The BII
includes a management tool and relational database (tested with
Oracle, MySQL and PostgreSQL). The former enables validation
and loading of an ISArchive and provides simple permissions
functionality to link users (or groups of users) to studies. The
latter manages the storage of experimental metadata, which can
be collectively searched and browsed via a query interface or
web services; the destination for associated data ﬁles, and their
protocol for transfer, is custom deﬁned by the local administrator
on installation. As an example, a publicly accessible instance
of the B11, maintained by the European Bioinformatics Institute
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bioinvindex), has proven useful as a curation
and storage system for multi—assay studies, and as a mechanism
for submitting data ﬁles to ArrayExpress, PRIDE, ENA and SRA.
Installation of the B11 system requires some knowledge of database
management. However, it is portable enough to be easily installed
in individual labs, to maximize the efﬁciency with which high—
throughput studies can be managed and shared among users that
have been granted access to them.

2.6 ISAconverter: submission to public repositories

ISAconverter recodes the relevant parts of ISArchives as MAGE—
Tab, PRIDE XML or SRA—XML (used by ArrayExpress, PRIDE and
ENA, SRA and DRA, respectively), enabling combined submission
to public omics repositories. It is readily extensible to support
export of other formats, e. g. SOFT required by GEO (Barrett et al.,
2009). Mappings for format elements are available in the ISA—Tab
speciﬁcation and documentation on the ISA web site.

3 COLLABORATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

Developed for the European multi—site ‘CarcinoGENOMICS’
project (Vinken et al., 2008), the ISA software suite version one
was released in early 2009. The core ISA developers are engaged
with an ever—growing number of collaborators: case studies from
early implementers already provide evidence of the diverse life
science scenarios in which the suite’s various components have been
successfully tested and are being used with large datasets (details on
the ISA web site). The main limitations recorded to date are simply
the person hours required to specify the standards and ontologies to
be used and to actually curate studies.

Demonstrable acceptance and community engagement has also
brought a new funding stream for this project, allowing us to
continue the collaborative development of this exemplar system that
supports data sharing policies, promotes the uptake of community—
deﬁned reporting standards and ontologies and enables curation
at source (Field et al., 2009). The ISA components, in particular
the B11, have been designed to provide core functionalities.
Inevitably, each collaborator has additional in—house requirements
that are too speciﬁc to be included as core functionality. This
may be due to the nature of their studies or their need for
one or more ISA software components to be interoperable with
existing systems. To support further collaborative development,

the core ISA developers are setting up an environment for
distributed development, and are augmenting the ISA code
base with Application Programming Interfaces (APIs). Ongoing
collaborative activities include: a module to enable the analysis
of ISA—Tab formatted metadata and any associated data, using
R; integration with other data management and analysis systems
(e.g. Fang et al., 2009; MetWare, http://metware.org); and
giving assistance to the growing number of projects exploring
the tools and underlying format (e.g. Sage http://sagecongress
.org/WP/workstreams/Standards; Kawaji et al., 2009). Other
collaborative activities include an enhanced user authentication
system, support for additional formats such as RDF, OWL and
SOFT, converters to/from lab equipment—related ﬁle formats (e. g.
sampling robots and mass spectrometers) and improved packaging
and distribution mechanisms to offer a single download bundle to
facilitate installation.

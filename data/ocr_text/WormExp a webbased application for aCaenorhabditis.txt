Abstract

Motivation: A particular challenge of the current omics age is to make sense of the inferred differ—
ential expression of genes and proteins. The most common approach is to perform a gene ontol—
ogy (GO) enrichment analysis, thereby relying on a database that has been extracted from a variety
of organisms and that can therefore only yield reliable information on evolutionary conserved

functions.

Results: We here present a web—based application for a taxon—specific gene set exploration and en—
richment analysis, which is expected to yield novel functional insights into newly determined gene
sets. The approach is based on the complete collection of curated high—throughput gene expres—
sion data sets for the model nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, including 1786 gene sets from

more than 350 studies.

Availability and implementation: WormExp is available at http://wormexp.zoologie.uni—kiel.de.

1 Introduction

High-throughput molecular technologies have greatly enhanced our
understanding of biological processes by characterizing expression
changes of genes (microarray and RNA—Seq data) and proteins
(proteomics data) or transcription factor targets and epigenetics
states (ChIP—chip and ChIP—Seq data). These technologies usually
yield hundreds or thousands of differentially regulated genes or pro—
teins that are not always easy to interpret. Validation of the numer—
ous differentially expressed genes is usually not possible. Uncovering
the underlying organizational principles from such large gene lists
requires computational and statistical approaches as well as precise
biological reference information.

Gene set enrichment analysis represents a powerful tool to link
the identified differentially expressed gene lists to biological proc—
esses and functions. They are based on the statistical evaluation of
the overlap between the generated gene set and a specified reference
list of genes. These enrichment analyses are usually based on public

databases such as those defined by Gene ontology (Ashburner et 61].,
2000) and KEGG pathways (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). However,
these existing databases have important drawbacks. First, the anno—
tations are incomplete and only a subset of known genes are func—
tionally annotated (King et 61]., 2003). For example, functional
information is only available for approximately 60% of the gene
repertoire of the nematode Caenorhabditis elegans, one of the most
intensively studied model organisms in biological research (Petersen
et 61]., 2015). Second, the included functional information is often
imprecise, as it usually represents an extrapolation from experimen-
tal data of a different taxon and thus assumes a high level of func—
tional conservation across evolution, which may not always be the
case (Khatri and Draghici, 2005). Third, functional information is
predicted for most organisms from protein domains. Taxon-specific
genes or protein domains may thus be missed. Taxon—specific gene
sets, which explicitly consider taxon—restricted genes and also taxon—
specific expression responses, are thus required for improved

functional genomic analyses. Several applications such as GSEA
(Subramanian et al., 2005) and EASE (Hosack et al., 2003) have
been developed to permit performance of enrichment analyses with
curated gene sets, derived for example from published expression
studies in the same organism. Yet, a systematic assessment of the
value of taxon—specific enrichment analyses is still missing.
WormExp provides a web resource to explore such an approach for
the nematode C.elegans.

This nematode has a well annotated genome sequence and is
widely used as a powerful model organism in biological research.
Over the last decade, more than 350 high—throughput expression
studies have been published, covering a large variety of research
themes, such as immunity, aging, development and stress responses.
The resulting lists of differentially expressed genes are publicly
available and can be related to a specific experimental design, envir-
onmental condition and/or gene defect. Because they capture a
variety of inducible expression responses of this particular organism,
they might be highly useful in interpreting new C.elegans gene lists
(Engelmann et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2015) or predicting candidates
for downstream analysis (Block et al., 2015 ). In this manuscript, we
present WormExp, a web—based application for gene set enrichment
analysis in C.elegans. We collated nearly all published high-
throughput expression data sets of C.elegans from public databases
and also the available literature. We classified these gene sets in nine
categories according to the experimental designs or specific
condition used. WormExp accepts Wormbase (Harris et al., 2010)
identifiers (IDs), sequence names, gene names or a mixture of these
as input. It offers tools for performing an enrichment analysis based
on the taxon—specific 1786 gene sets, searching specific gene lists
and downloading complete data sets.

2 Methods and features

WormExp utilizes a curated database built from published
high-throughput expression studies in the nematode C.elegans. The
database can be downloaded and will be updated continuously. Users
start their analysis by uploading a gene list, for example a set of genes,
whose expression is induced upon C.elegans exposure to a certain
condition. The user then has two options (Fig. 1 and workﬂow in
manual): (i) perform an enrichment analysis using either the entire
database as reference or selected categories of gene lists (e.g. ‘mu—
tants’), or (ii) search for overlaps between the uploaded gene set and
specific gene lists (e.g. ‘up pink-1 mutant’), selected from the database
with the help of keywords (e.g. ‘pmk—1’). For enrichment analysis,
WormExp employs the adjusted Fisher exact test from the program
EASE, which penalizes or removes one gene within a given gene set
from the test list and calculates the p—value (for further details, see
manual in supplementary file). This modulation makes the Fisher
exact test more robust when applied on gene sets supported by few
genes, thus reducing false positives (for details, please see (Hosack
et al., 2003)). WormExp is available as a webserver with an interface
from InterMine (Smith et al., 2012), developed by Java 2 Enterprise
System (J2EE) and Java Remote Method Invocations (RMI). RMI en—
sures fast responses due to memory—oriented query. See supplemen
tary files S1 and S2 for manual and detailed information.

2.1 Data structure

Currently, the WormExp database includes 1786 gene sets derived
from 361 studies and collated from the NCBI GEO database
(Barrett et al., 2009), ArrayExpress database (Brazma et al., 2003),
Stanford microarray database (Sherlock et al., 2001), Princeton

University MicroArray database and directly from the literature
(Supplementary Data S1). According to experimental design and
used conditions, we classified these 1786 gene sets into nine catego—
ries: Kim Mountains (Kim et al., 2001); Mutants (differentially
expressed genes in mutants or upon RNA interference-silencing of a
particular gene); Microbes (exposure to various microorganisms),
TF Targets (transcription factor targets inferred by knock—down/
knock—out of the respective transcription factors), Tissue (tissue spe—
cific expression), Development/Dauer/Aging (differential expression
in the various developmental stages and during aging), DAF/Insulin/
food (differential expression in response to food, starvation, or
insulin-like receptor activation/de—activation), Chemicals/stress
(exposure to chemical compounds or other stressors) and Other (all
gene sets not included above). The database will be updated regu—
larly to integrate new C. elegans expression studies.

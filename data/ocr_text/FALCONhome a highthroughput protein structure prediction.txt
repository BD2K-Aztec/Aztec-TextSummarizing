Abstract

Summary: The protein structure prediction approaches can be categorized into template-based
modeling (including homology modeling and threading) and free modeling. However, the existing
threading tools perform poorly on remote homologous proteins. Thus, improving fold recognition
for remote homologous proteins remains a challenge. Besides, the proteome-wide structure pre-
diction poses another challenge of increasing prediction throughput.

In this study, we presented FALCON@home as a protein structure prediction server focusing on re-
mote homologue identification. The design of FALCON@home is based on the observation that a
structural template, especially for remote homologous proteins, consists of conserved regions
intervveaved with highly variable regions. The highly variable regions lead to vague alignments in
threading approaches. Thus, FALCON@home first extracts conserved regions from each template
and then aligns a query protein with conserved regions only rather than the full-length template
directly. This helps avoid the vague alignments rooted in highly variable regions, improving re-
mote homologue identification.

We implemented FALCON@home using the Berkeley Open Infrastructure of Network Computing
(BOINC) volunteer computing protocol. With computation power donated from over 20 000 volun-
teer CPUs, FALCON@home shows a throughput as high as processing of over 1000 proteins per
day. In the Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP11), the FALCON@home-
based prediction was ranked the 12th in the template-based modeling category. As an application,
the structures of 880 mouse mitochondria proteins were predicted, which revealed the significant
correlation between protein half-lives and protein structural factors.

1 Introduction

The protein structure prediction problem is concerned with the predic-
tion of three-dimensional structure of a protein from its primary se-
quence of residues. Based on whether homologous templates exist for
the query protein, the prediction approaches can be categorized into
template-based modeling (TBM, including homology modeling and
threading) and free modeling (FM). Specifically, a threading approach
recognizes the most likely fold of the query protein and reports its
alignments to known structural templates as output. This strategy has
been relatively successful for various proteins; however, the existing
threading approaches have performed poorly for remote homologous
proteins. Thus, improving the fold recognition for remote homologous
proteins remains a challenge to protein structure prediction (Liu
et al., 2014). In addition, currently available prediction servers, such
as ROSETTA, I-TASSER (Yang et al., 2015) and RaptorX (Peng and
Xu, 2011) are far from meeting the needs of high-throughput structure
prediction from the community. More servers supporting proteome-
wide structure prediction are in high demand.

In general, the sequences of remote homologous proteins show a
relatively weak signal of native structures. However, this does not
indicate a lack of sequence conservation features for structure. In
fact, during the evolutionary process of homologous proteins, some
regions are conserved while some regions are relatively variable in
term of structure and sequence. The conserved regions are known as
common structural frameworks that are shared by homologous pro-
teins. Note that Xu et al. (2003) successfully utilized the concept of
conserved region in the design of RAPTOR. This observation is also
supported by the success of multiple-templates threading
strategy (Peng and Xu, 2011). Thus, based on this observation, we
have proposed a novel threading approach to improving remote
homologue identification and further developed a high-throughput
protein structure prediction server called FALCON@home.

2 Implementation

The FALCON@home server consists of two major modules, namely,
TBM and ab initio modules (Supplementary Fig. S1). The TBM
module was designed to recognize the homologous templates for the
query protein sequence and to report alignments with identified
homologous templates. Specifically, for each template, all of its
homologous proteins were first identified based on sequence and
structure similarity. Next we employed an integer linear program to
calculate the common structural frameworks shared by these hom-
ologous proteins (Zhu et al., 2015). Then we aligned the query pro-
tein against the common structural frameworks, which helps to
avoid vague alignments rooted in the structurally variable segments
of templates. Finally, the full-length alignments between query and
templates were generated by using the tree conditional random field
(Tree-CRF) model (Zhang et al., 2015) (see SI Section 2 for details).
If the TBM module failed to identify homologues for the query
protein, FALCON@home activates the FALCON ab initio
module (Li et al., 2008) to generate models from the very beginning.
Brieﬂy speaking, the FALCON ab initio module employs a statistical
model to describe the local structural preference for each residue
and uses a position-specific hidden Markov model to describe the
dependencies of neighboring residues (see SI Section 3 for details).

To accelerate the computational process, we deployed the TBM
modules onto the Berkeley Open Infrastructure of Network
Computing (BOINC) volunteer computing platform. In particular, a
total of about 50 000 common frameworks were split into 32 clus-
ters. Each BOINC client aligns the query protein against the com-
mon frameworks in a certain cluster and returns the alignments to
the BOINC server for further selection. Currently, FALCON@home
has over 20 000 volunteer CPUs from all around the world and can
process over 1200 proteins per day.

3 Results

3.1 CASP11 evaluation

In the CASP11 competition, the FALCON@home-based server,
FALCON_TOPO, was ranked 12th over the TBM category and 17th
over the FM category. An enhanced version of FALCON@home,
FALCON_EnvFold, was ranked 9th over the TBM category (see SI
Section 4). The results indicated the advantage of FALCON@home in
remote homologue identification. Take the CASP11 target T0678 as
an example. The challenge was to determine how to align the three
N-terminal strands. Using the pre-calculated common frameworks,
FALCON@home successfully identified the most similar template as
4gt6_A and finally generated a high-quality prediction model with a
TM-score of 0.84 (see Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.2 Application in the investigation of protein half-life
Recently, we applied FALCON@home to investigate the relation-
ship between protein half—life and protein tertiary structure. In par-
ticular, we used FALCON@home to predict structures for a total of
6033 mouse proteins in 6 days, including 442 proteins expressed in
mouse liver mitochondria, 438 proteins expressed in mouse brain-
stem mitochondria, and 5153 nucleic proteins. Then we calculated
the surface residue ratio as the number of residues on protein surface
over the total number of residues in the protein. Analysis of the 880
mitochondrial proteins revealed a strongly negative correlation be-
tween the surface residue ratio and protein half-life (correlation co-
efficient is around —0.81). Thus, in other words, with the increase in
the ratio, the protein is more likely to be degraded quickly.

4 Conclusions and discussion

With the rapid growth of protein sequences, the needs for structure
prediction have also increased. FALCON@home provides free and
high-throughput service for protein structure prediction. The experi-
mental results in CASP11 evaluation have presented the advantages
of using FALCON@home in remote homologue identification. In
addition, the application in the investigation of protein half-life also
demonstrates that FALCON@home can be used in the proteome-
wide prediction.

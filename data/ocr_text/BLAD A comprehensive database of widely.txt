ABSTRACT

Motivation: Beta-lactamases confer resistance to a broad range of
antibiotics and inhibitors by accumulating mutations. The number of
beta-lactamases and their variants is steadily increasing. The horizon-
tal gene transfer likely plays a major role in dissemination of these
markers to new environments and hosts. Moreover, information
about the beta-lactamase classes and their variants was scattered.
Categorizing all these classes and their associated variants along with
their epidemiology and resistance pattern information on one platform
could be helpful to the researcher working on multidrug-resistant bac-
teria. Thus, the beta-lactamase database (BLAD) has been developed
to provide comprehensive information (epidemiology and resistance
pattern) on beta-lactamases. Beta-lactamase gene sequences in
BLAD are linked with structural data, phenotypic data (i.e. antibiotic
resistance) and literature references to experimental studies. In sum-
mary, BLAD integrates information that may provide insight into the
epidemiology of multidrug resistance and enable the designing of
novel drug candidates.

1 INTRODUCTION

Beta-lactamases are one of the major causes of resistance against
beta-lactam antibiotics (Ghuysen, 1991). Carbapenem—resistant
Enterobacteriaceae has been increased in bacterial strains iso-
lated from nosocomial infections in past 10 years (Jacob et al.,
2013). Based on the sequence, the beta-lactamases are divided
into four classes A—D (Barry and Barlow, 2005). Class A, C and
D are serine beta-lactamases, whereas class B enzymes are
metallo-beta—lactamases. Class A provides the most commonly
encountered mechanism of bacterial resistance to beta-lactam
antibiotics. It appears to be the most widely distributed class
of beta-lactamases and capable of hydrolyzing penicillins and
classical cephalosporins (Jan and Niels, 2007). The genes of
class B beta-lactamases are implicated in the hydrolysis of ceph-
alosporins and carbapenems and are located on both chromo-
somes and plasmids. Some of the most prevalent class B enzymes
include IMP, VIM, NDM and SPN. The NDM-1 was a recent

addition to this class, which was isolated from a patient hospi-
talized in India (Khan and Nordmann, 2012).

Another class of enzyme is a serine-hydrolyzing class C be-
longing to the cephalosporinases family, which confers resistance
to broad-spectrum cephalosporin including cefoxime and ceftazi-
dime. Some of the most prevalent enzymes of this class are
AmpC, CMY, ACC, produced by gram-negative bacteria
(Gregg et al., 2001). The enzyme OXA beta-lactamases belongs
to class D, and 240 OXA type beta-lactamases have been char-
acterized so far. Several recent efforts (Thai and Pleiss 2010; Thai
et al., 2009) have been made to partially unify the information
about the beta-lactamases with limited functionalities. The main
limitation of such resources is lack of information for all types of
beta-lactamases class. Thus, to address these limitations and to
facilitate the characterization of these beta-lactamases, we have
integrated sequence, structural and experimental information on
a common platform. Although, the information available in the
previously published resources are useful (Thai and Pleiss 2010;
Thai et al., 2009), such resources do not provide the information
for all types of beta-lactamases. Moreover, other resources
(Liu and Pop, 2009; Singh et al., 2008) lack the information
about the 3D structures and inhibitors resistance proﬁle of the
beta-lactamases. Beta-lactamase database (BLAD) represents the
most extensive catalog for maximum type of beta-lactamases
(Class A—D) along with other unique features such as search
by source, country, type, variant along with local alignment,
restriction enzyme digestion analysis tools, which are lacking in
previously published databases of this kind. Hence, our anno-
tated and updated database will provide broad information to
the researchers.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

BLAD (version 1.0) consists of four search ﬁelds. (i) Database: It
contains information about the sequences (nucleotide and pro-
tein). Each entry has been cross-linked to NCBI and Pubmed
database. With the export option, users can easily download all
information for their search type. (ii) Resistance: It contains
information about beta-lactamases that confer resistance to
drugs or inhibitors. (iii) PDBS: It contains information about
the 3D structure of enzymes and their variants along with the
description of physiochemical properties of bound ligands.
(iV) Genome: Contains the information of the plasmids harbor-
ing the beta-lactamase gene. This information is included as type,
variant, organism, resistance, mutant, protein and nucleotide se-
quences with NCBI links, literature reference with the PubMed
links and export option. Cross-reference to the UniProt protein

sequence database is also provided. The current version of
BLAD holds ~2000 gene sequences along with ~2OO crystal
structures for different types of beta-lactamases. All the
data were collected from literature, NCBI, protein data
bank (Sussman et al., 1998) and other authentic resources
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 DATABASE INTERFACE AND TOOLS

BLAD was built on Apache server 2.2.11 (http://www.apache.
org/) with Hypertext preprocessor program PHP (http://www.
php.net/). The database tables were stored in MySQL 5.0 rela-
tional database. This database has six options for users.
(i) Home: Provides the basic introduction about the beta-
lactamases. (ii) Database: Users can use this option for searching
the gene query of their interests. (iii) Resistance Pattern: Provides
the information about the resistance pattern of each query.
(iV) PDBS: This is used to search and analyze the 3D structure
of beta-lactamase. (V) Contacts: Provides the contact address of
the developer. (Vi) Feedback: Allows the users to send the sug-
gestions and comments for the further development of this data-
base. BLAD can be searched using class, type, variant, organism,
country, resistance type as keywords. The search output includes
a summary table (Supplementary Fig. S2a—d) for all the matched
entries. We have also integrated the bioinformatics tools as
BLADrestrict and BLAST for analyzing the sequences.

4 DISCUSSION AND FUTURE PROSPECTS

BLAD is the ﬁrst comprehensive database especially developed
to catalog, and categorize, the resistance pattern about all classes
of beta-lactamases identiﬁed by experimental studies. It also pro-
vides the information about the 3D structure along with the
physiochemical properties of bound ligands. This database is
equipped with ﬂexible search features including user-friendly
browse and hypertext link-outs to nucleotide and protein
sequence databases. We trust that BLAD will be a useful
platform for experimental and computational analyses of

beta-lactamases. Future update of BLAD will contain the infor-
mation about primers for each class and their variants. This
database will be updated manually by incorporating new data
and resources as soon as they become available.

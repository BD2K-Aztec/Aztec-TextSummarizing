ABSTRACT

Summary: DNA copy number and mRNA expression are commonly
used data types in cancer studies. Available software for integrative
analysis arbitrarily fixes the parametric form of the association
between the two molecular levels and hence offers no opportunities
for modelling it. We present a new tool for flexible modelling of this
association. PLRS uses a wide class of interpretable models including
popular ones and incorporates prior biological knowledge. It is
capable to identify the gene-speciﬁc type of relationship between
gene copy number and mRNA expression. Moreover, it tests the
strength of the association and provides confidence intervals. We
illustrate PLRS using glioblastoma data from The Cancer Genome
Atlas.

Availability and implementation: PLRS is implemented as an R
package and available from Bioconductor (as of version 2.12; http://
bioconductor.org). Additional code for parallel computations is avail-
able as Supplementary Material.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA copy number aberrations are characteristics of the cancer
cell. These aberrations are gains and losses of chromosomal
DNA, which may alter expression levels of mRNA transcripts.
The identiﬁcation of genes for which an abnormal copy number
affects gene expression is important in cancer studies, as these
genes are likely to be relevant for tumourigenesis. Here, we pre-
sent a new tool for exploratory and conﬁrmatory analysis of such
effects.

For a given gene, copy number and mRNA expression are
generally believed to be concordant. The exact form of the asso-
ciation is usually not established. In fact, the shape is likely to
differ between genes because of the presence of different (post-)
transcriptional regulatory mechanisms. Tools that investigate the
interaction between the two molecular levels assist in better
understanding of regulatory mechanisms.

Numerous software packages have been proposed for joint
analysis of copy number and gene expression data (Chari
et al., 2008; Le Cao et al., 2009; Lee and Kim, 2009; Louhimo

and Hautaniemi, 2011; Salari et al., 2010; van Wieringen et al.,
2006). However, most of these ﬁx the association between DNA
and RNA a priori, typically a linear or piecewise constant line.
Hence, these approaches do not permit investigation or identiﬁ-
cation of the shape of the association. Recently, the need for
more subtle models has been highlighted (Leday et al., 2013;
Nemes et al., 2012; Solvang et al., 2011) to reﬂect the biological
mechanisms between the two molecular levels. Here, we describe
the R package PLRS that implements the framework recently
proposed by Leday et al. (2013). PLRS uses piecewise linear re-
gression splines, which allow multiple linear lines, and are a wide
class of interpretable models including the linear and piecewise
constant ones. It enforces concordance by restricting relevant
model parameters. In addition, PLRS tests the strength of the
overall association, identiﬁes its functional shape and provides
conﬁdence intervals for the estimated curve. We illustrate PLRS
using a dataset from 160 glioblastoma samples obtained from
The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA).

2 MODEL

PLRS models cis—relationships between copy number and
mRNA expression by piecewise linear regression splines (Leday
et al., 2013). The relevance of this class of models is multifold.
Unlike other methods, PLRS combines copy number data from
various steps of the preprocessing, namely, the segmented and
called data (van de Wiel et al., 2011). Segmented data are con-
tinuous (logz-values) and provide the (relative) amount of DNA
copies (gene dosage), whereas called data represent discrete states
associated with the various types of copy number aberration; the
biological literature commonly distinguishes four of these: ‘loss’
(less than two copies of genomic DNA), ‘normal’ (two copies),
‘gain’ (three to four copies) and ‘ampliﬁcation’ (more than four
copies). Second, PLRS allows the effect of DNA on mRNA to
differ across types of aberrations. This is biologically plausible:
the efﬁcacy of mechanisms that compensate for genomic aberra-
tions may differ between losses, gains and ampliﬁcations. Third,
good interpretability is ensured by the piecewise linearity of the
model and a set of restrictions on the parameters. For example,
copy number is concordant with gene expression and ‘normal’
copy number cannot severely alter gene expression.

In this context, the R package PLRS implements various stat-
istical procedures to detect which and how gene copy number
abnormalities alter the gene expression level. Identiﬁcation of the
functional form of the association is achieved by model selection,
which automatically merges copy number states when their

association with mRNA expression can be captured with one
regression line. Simultaneous conﬁdence intervals on the selected
curve are provided for more detailed description. Finally, a stat-
istical test evaluates the signiﬁcance of the overall association by
testing the null hypothesis: copy number does not affect mRNA
expression, leading to a single horizontal line.

3 RESULTS

We applied PLRS to a dataset of 160 glioblastoma tumour sam-
ples obtained from TCGA (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/;
Verhaak et al., 2010) for which copy number (Agilent CGH
Microarray 244A) and mRNA expression (Agilent 244K plat-
form) were available. We found that for many known cancer
genes, the expression level is strongly associated with DNA
aberrations (cf. Supplementary Material). Figure 1 depicts the
DNA—mRNA association for four genes, including known
cancer genes MET, ERCC2 and AGAP2. Clearly, relationships
are different and demonstrate that the ﬂexibility of the PLRS
model allows new insights in the association. For gene MET,
we observe that the effect of ampliﬁcations extends that of
gains more than proportionally. For ERCC2, the expression
level of samples with loss and normal copy number differs in
average and expression increases linearly with dosage.

Copy number states are indicated by symbols: loss (open inverted trian-
gles), normal (open circles), gain (open triangles) and ampliﬁcation (multi-
plication symbols). Grey surfaces correspond to 95% uniform conﬁdence
bands. The top left value corresponds to the P—value of the PLRS test

Ampliﬁcations of gene AGAP2 have a strong effect on mRNA
expression, whereas gains have none. The effect as deﬁned by
PLRS is broad and expressed by both an intercept and a slope
for each copy number aberration state. The variety of models
resulting from PLRS contrasts with most other methods, which
impose a unique parametric form to all genes. Our method lets
the data decide what is most appropriate. As a consequence,
PLRS has more power than other standard methods for detect-
ing relatively large effects occurring in small subgroups of sam-
ples (Leday et al., 2013). Note that other non-linear techniques,
e.g. based on mutual information, can be competitive but less
interpretable.

4 CONCLUSION

PLRS is a tool for ﬂexible modelling of the association between
DNA copy number and mRNA expression. We demonstrated its
potential to reveal interesting relationships. It is particularly
useful for (i) a detailed understanding of the relationship between
DNA copy number and mRNA expression and (ii) powerful
detection of copy number-induced sample subgroup-speciﬁc
effects, thereby acknowledging heterogeneity of many cancers.
The software can also be used for studying the effect of DNA
copy number on microRNA expression.

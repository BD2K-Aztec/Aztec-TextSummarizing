Abstract

Summary: Gene targeting is a protocol for introducing a mutation to a specific gene in an
organism. Because of the importance of in vivo assessment of gene function and modeling of
human diseases, this technique has been widely adopted to generate a large number of mutant
mouse models. Due to the recent breakthroughs in high-throughput sequencing technologies,
RNA-Seq experiments have been performed on many of these mouse models, leading to hundreds
of publicly available datasets. To facilitate the reuse of these datasets, we collected the associated
metadata and organized them in a database called RNASequtaDB. The metadata were manually
curated to ensure annotation consistency. We developed a web server to allow easy database
navigation and data querying. Users can search the database using multiple parameters like genes,
diseases, tissue types, keywords and associated publications in order to find datasets that match
their interests. Summary statistics of the metadata are also presented on the web server showing
interesting global patterns of RNA-Seq studies.

1 Introduction

 

Gene targeting (Capecchi, 1989), a powerful technique used to
manipulate a specific locus in the genome of an organism, is an indis-
pensable tool for assessing in vivo functions of specific gene products.
This technique provides great ﬂexibility in manipulating the genome
of an organism as it can be used to delete a gene or an exon, to intro-
duce an exogenous gene, or to create point mutations. Moreover,
gene targeting not only can introduce permanent mutations, but can
also conditionally change targeted genes. Thousands of genetically

engineered mice have been generated using this technique. They
provide valuble models for studying mechanisms of human diseases.
RNA-Seq (Wang et al., 2009), a high-throughput sequencing
(HTS) method for transcriptome analysis, has been successfully used
on many of these mouse models, enabling global analyses of specific
genomic alterations at a high sequencing depth with a resonable accur-
acy. As RNA-Seq becomes increasingly popular, hundreds of RNA-Seq
datasets have been generated and have been released to the public.
These data are currently available from online repositories, such as

Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et al., 2013), ArrayExpress
(Rustici et al., 2013), Sequence Read Archive (Kodama et al., 2012)
and European Nucleotide Archive (ENA) (Brunak et al., 2002), whose
primary purposes are to store raw and processed HTS data from a
wide variety of organisms. However, a data submitter typically pro-
vides only limited metadata for each dataset sufficient to get the dataset
accepted into the public repository. There is currently no stringent and
uniform quality check of submitted metadata. This results in inconsist-
ency and ambiguity in dataset annotation. For example, non-official
gene symbols are used in some of the datasets. Other public databases
such as InSilico DB (Coletta et al., 2012) also suffer from the same
problems, making searching for datasets in these databases inefficient.

The recent HTS data explosion has motivated researchers to create
several metadata databases. However, these databases, e.g.
CistromeMap (Qin et al., 2012), focus primarily on ChIP-Seq data. To
fill the gap for RNA-Seq data, we collected RNA-Seq metadata from
all the publicly available datasets that were generated using mouse
models mostly with targeted mutations and curated a database called
RNASequtaDB. Haynes et al. (2013) recently suggested that measur-
ing transcription factor binding might not be the best way to decipher
transcriptional regulatory networks. Instead, their work showed that
gene expression data could be of greater value in revealing functional
gene regulatory relations. Therefore, RNASequtaDB may be a help-
ful resource for researchers trying to build gene regulatory networks.

We developed a web server to provide a user-friendly query inter-
face for locating relevant RNA-Seq datasets based on targeted gene
names, disease names, tissue types, keywords, publications and acces-
sion IDs, etc. An ontological search function is also offered that allows
users to find the datasets related to, but not necessarily annotated to,
the exact search term. This helps ensure search sensitivity (e.g. see the
help page on the website). This database can help biomedical scientists
navigate the complex landscape of mouse genetic experiments and can
provide rich contexts for these datasets. Using this database, users will
be able to find related datasets for further analyses easily. For example,
RNA-Seq data can be used to infer splicing isoform functions (Eksi
et al., 2013) and information extracted from existing RNA-Seq data
can be used as prior knowledge for causal reasoning on biological net-
works (Chindelevitch et al., 2012). Moreover, RNA-Seq data can be
integrated with sequence- and structure-binding preferences of RNA-
binding proteins learned with computational methods such as
GraphProt (Maticzka et al., 2014), which can increase our understand-
ing of the mechanisms of post-transcriptional regulation.

2 Methods

We collected raw annotations of publicly available mouse RNA-Seq
datasets from HTS data repositories including GEO, ArrayExpress
and ENA. At the time of writing, RNASequtaDB contains 306
experiments in total. The following metadata were systematically
annotated for each RNA-Seq dataset: gene symbol, genotype, refer-
ence (including title, authors, abstract, PubMed ID), disease, tissue
type, corresponding author and author’s website link. Genotype and
disease annotations were manually curated and extracted from the
original publications. For consistency, genes, alleles, diseases and tis-
sue types were annotated using official symbols or controlled vocabu-
laries from online resources including Mouse Genome Informatics
(MGI) (Blake et al., 2014), Medical Subject Headings (MeSH)
(Rogers, 1963) and BRENDA Tissue Ontology (Gremse et al., 2011).

To facilitate querying and data retrieval, we implemented a web
server (http://rnaseqmetadb.ece.tamu.edu). All search functionalities
are integrated within a single web interface. Users can search for one
or multiple datasets using gene symbols, disease names, tissue types

or keywords. The search generates a list of matched datasets
containing accession IDs, titles, mutated genes, related diseases and
tissue types. To support more general database queries, ambiguous
keyword search is provided by the server. Users can type one or
multiple terms that they are interested in into the Keyword search
box. Both the typed words and their synonyms defined by the
Experimental Factor Ontology (Malone et al., 2010) will be
searched in the database, and then the query results will be
displayed. If a more targeted search is needed, users are allowed to
use additional terms in the Search text box above the result table to
refine the results. This retrieves only the datasets whose titles match
these additional terms. When the accession ID of a dataset is clicked,
RNASequtaDB displays a summary table of all the metadata avail-
able for that dataset. The links to other databases and websites like
ArrayExpress, GEO, MGI, PubMed and MeSH, and the P15’ lab
websites are provided so that users can easily obtain additional in-
formation related to the datasets. Users can also bulk download
data after registering an account on the website. To keep the data
updated, the website allows users to submit requests for adding data
entries for newly published RNA-Seq datasets.

3 Results

RNASequtaDB permits efficient searching of its database containing
comprehensive information for all public RNA-Seq datasets on mice
with genotype as a factor. It contains metadata for a total of 306 ex-
periments targeting 298 different genes. These experiments are from
264 different research groups, among which 154 are from the USA and
76 are from Europe. For journals publishing the studies using these
datasets, Nature ranks at the top with the greatest number of studies,
followed by Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the
United States of America and Genes and Development. One interesting
observation is that the number of publications on RNA-Seq studies has
been increasing exponentially since 2008. This indicates that RNA-Seq
experiments on gene-targeted mouse models have become more popu-
lar in recent years. Summary statistics of the datasets are available at
the database website.

RNASequtaDB broadens the use of these datasets by providing
well-curated metadata and efficient query functionalities. Scientists can
easily find the datasets that they are interested in and retrieve detailed
information to enable more comprehensive understanding of the experi-
ments. In the future, we will develop additional functionalities and im-
port more datasets into the database. We believe that RNASequtaDB
will be a valuable tool for the biomedical research community.

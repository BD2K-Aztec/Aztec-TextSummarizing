ABSTRACT

Motivation: The complete sequencing of the human genome shows
that only 1% of the entire genome encodes for proteins. The major
part of the genome is made up of non-coding DNA, regulatory
elements and junk DNA. Transcriptional regulation plays a central role
in a multitude of critical cellular processes and responses, and it is
a central force in the development and differentiation of multicellular
organisms. Identifying regulatory elements is one of the major tasks
in this challenge. To accomplish this task, we developed a solid
and simple suite that allows direct access to genomic database and
immediate result check. We introduce COM PASSS (COMplex PAttern
of Sequence Search Software), a simple and effective tool for motif
search in entire genomes. Motifs can be partially degenerated and
interrupted by spacers of variable length.

Results: We demonstrate through real biological data mining the
simplicity and robustness of this tool. The test was performed on
two well-known protein domains and a highly variable cis-acting
element. COMPASSS successfully identifies both protein domains
and cis-acting semi-conserved elements.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding the signiﬁcance of unannotated DNA sequences
from genome projects is one of the major challenges, nowadays.
Interpretation of the genetic code allowed to discover over 30 000
protein-coding genes in the human genome (International Human
Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2004). However, the major part
of the genomes is not made up of genes encoding for proteins (Venter
et al., 2001). The genetic code can be transcribed in non-coding RNA
or it can be constituted of cis-acting regulatory sequences such as

promoters, enhancers and other elements that affect gene expression
and alternative splicing (Balakirev and Ayala, 2003; Tress et al.,
2007). Moreover, most of the genomes are constituted by intergenic
sequences that may have a regulatory role, but are deﬁned as ‘junk
DNA’ because we are unable to understand its function, yet.

Nowadays, the availability of a wide range of genome sequences
has greatly accelerated research to decipher the genomic regulatory
code. To clarify the cryptic nature of the human genome,
the ENCODE (the ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements) research
consortium has been launched. Functional elements in the human
genome will be shared in a public database (The ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2007). The pilot phase of the project tested and
compared existing methods to analyze a small portion of the human
genome sequence (1%). Now the project has been scaled to the entire
human genome. In silico motif search within DNA sequences is one
of the most challenging problems in molecular biology and computer
science and there is a large body of work done in developing search
algorithms. However, each of these approaches has its own strengths
and weaknesses, while the quality of the detected motifs may vary
from case to case (Das and Dai, 2007).

In this work, we propose a simple and effective tool named
COMPASSS (COMplex Pattern of Sequence Search Software) that
allows mining whole genomes for the presence of complex elements.
The tool is user-friendly, ﬂexible, not resource intensive and capable
of browse whole genomes in minutes. COMPASSS applies the
well-known Wu-Manber multiple pattern matching algorithm to
exhaustively search for motifs in the entire sequence. Input elements
can be simple conserved sequences (as in BLAST engine), partially
or highly degenerated sequences, or even multiple degenerated
sequences, joined by poorly conserved variable length spacers.
We successfully tested COMPASSS against three experimentally
validated complex patterns, providing evidences that the tool
successfully identiﬁes both protein domains as well as cis-acting
semi-conserved elements.

2 METHODS
2.1 Motif deﬁnition

Input motifs can be composed of one or more patterns interspaced by zero or
more spacers. A pattern can be speciﬁed by regular bases (A, T, G, C, U) as
well as IUPAC ambiguous nucleotides or positional weight matrix (PWM).
A spacer is deﬁned by a ﬁxed length l and a range r; the ﬁnal spacer length
can vary from l— r and 1+ r.

2.2 Primary pattern deﬁnition

Before the searching phase, a primary pattern is deﬁned. COMPASSS starts
the motif search from the most complex pattern speciﬁed within the input
motif. Pattern complexity is proportional to its length and ambiguity. A longer
pattern is less likely to match the input sequence:
K 1
1_ _
=1 Rx

x

where K is the pattern length and ins the number of possible matching
symbols at pattern position x.

2.3 Motif search

Our approach uses a modiﬁed implementation of the Wu-Manber algorithm
(Wu and Manber, 1994) to search for the desired motif within the whole input
sequence. This method has been chosen for the ability to search in the input
sequence for multiple patterns at the same time and for no preprocessing
phase on the input string. The last point has great importance; the aim was
to create a ﬂexible and robust program for the search of motif into whole
genomes. In the preprocessing phase, the original Wu-Manber algorithm
builds three tables to speed up the text processing. The SHIFT table is used
to determinate how many characters in the text can be shifted when the text
is scanned. The HASH and PREFIX tables are used when a match is found
and to verify the match. The algorithm reads blocks of characters and search
for a match in the shift table. If a correspondence is found, the algorithm
checks the entire string for a match. Otherwise the text is shifted. In this
implementation of the algorithm a fourth table is added, the FOUND buffer.
The found buffer is a circular buffer of the same size of the deﬁned motif that
shifts with the input sequence to keep track of the latest patterns found. When
a match is found, the FOUND buffer is checked for the previous pattern at
the deﬁned position. If the pattern is found, the FOUND buffer is updated.
If the last item of the motif is found, a new result is added. This approach
greatly reduces memory usage and allocation of incomplete results.

For each found motif, a score is given. The total score of a found motif
is given by the sum of every pattern score (Si) normalized with its spacer
score:

" |ld- —le-| m
ES,- (1— #) where, for PWM: S,- 2 HP]-
. r i .
i—l 1:1
The pattern score S,- is 1 for IUPAC input sequences and the product of
each positional score (Pj) for PWM input patterns. The spacer score is deﬁned
by the difference between the deﬁned spacer length (ld) and the actual found
value (le) in absolute value, normalized by the given range (r).

2.4 Database mining

The COMPASSS suite has built-in database mining capability. The motif
search process can be accomplished on local ﬁles or on NCBI nucleotide
database entries through NCBI entrez utility. Moreover, COMPASSS
can search for motif on speciﬁc genomic regions, without the need to
download entire sequences. This task is accomplished thanks to the DAS
protocol (www.biodas.org) and the MySQL access to ENSEMBL servers
(http://www.ensembl.org/info/data/mysql.html). Test data were downloaded
Via ENTREZ utilities at NCBI database. For the DAS search, the ensemble
server has been used (http://www.ensembl.org/das/sources).

3 RESULTS

To evaluate the effectiveness of the algorithm, tests were performed
on actual biological data. In particular, we focused our attention
on two semi-conserved protein domains and a cis-acting element:
the human globin gene family, the mammalian POU-domain
transcription factors, and the T P53 responsive elements. In order to

deﬁne the signature of each input motif, CLUSTALW algorithm was
run and a multiple alignment of known target regions was obtained.
Thus, conserved and degenerated bases were identiﬁed and input
motif was deﬁned.

The human globin gene family input motif was composed of
three degenerated sequences, separated by two conserved spacers
(CTGCACKS < 13,2>GTGGAYCC<12,0>GGTG) and designed
to recognize the second exon of the alpha and beta locus. The
software successfully identiﬁes both the alpha and beta globin genes.

The POU domain motif consists of a bipartite motif on the
C—terminal region of the POUH domain (Ryan and Rosenfeld,
1997). The two degenerated sequences of the POU motif are
separated by a spacer of a ﬁxed length of 5 bp. The input motif was
MGNGTBTGGTTYTGYAA<5,1>GVCARR. A search against the
entire Homo sapiens genome results in a complete list of all known
members of the POU domain family, plus two genes with high
afﬁnity and homology with the POU domain family.

The tetrameric p53 protein binds to two repeats of a
consensus DNA sequence composed by two conserved pairs
each arranged as inverted complement elements separated by
a variable spacer region (El—Deiry et al., 1992; Levine, 1997).
With the COMPASSS suite, we searched for all p53 regulatory
motives throughout the entire human genome using the input
data RRRCWWGYYY<7,7>NRRCWWGYYN. The software
identiﬁed most of the experimentally validated p53 responsive
elements. Detailed results can be found in Supplementary Material.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this article, we showed that COMPASSS is an efﬁcient and
powerful tool for capturing most of the real motifs with proven
biological activity. In contrast with other motif-search tools,
COMPASSS is efﬁcient, fast and not resource intensive. The suite
can be used for mining cis-acting elements, including promoters,
splice sites or regulatory regions.

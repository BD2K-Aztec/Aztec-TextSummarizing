Abstract

Motivation: Circular RNAs (circRNAs) are a poorly characterized class of molecules that have been
identified decades ago. Emerging high-throughput sequencing methods as well as first reports on
confirmed functions have sparked new interest in this RNA species. However, the computational
detection and quantification tools are still limited.

Results: We developed the software tandem, DCC and CircTest. DCC uses output from the STAR
read mapper to systematically detect back-splice junctions in next-generation sequencing data.
DCC applies a series of filters and integrates data across replicate sets to arrive at a precise list
of circRNA candidates. We assessed the detection performance of DCC on a newly generated
mouse brain data set and publicly available sequencing data. Our software achieves a much higher
precision than state-of—the-art competitors at similar sensitivity levels. Moreover, DCC estimates
circRNA versus host gene expression from counting junction and non-junction reads. These read
counts are finally used to test for host gene-independence of circRNA expression across different
experimental conditions by our R package CircTest. We demonstrate the benefits of this ap-
proach on previously reported age-dependent circRNAs in the fruit fly.

1 Introduction

 

CircRNAs are a recently rediscovered class of abundant and universally
expressed RNA species (Jeck and Sharpless, 2014). The development
of software solutions for detecting and quantifying circRNAs is slowly
gaining momentum despite the increasing interest in circRNAs.
CircRNAs are characterized by a back-splicing event where the down-
stream 3' splicing ‘tail’ joins back with the upstream 5’ splicing ‘head’
to form a circular RNA structure (see Supplementary Fig. 51).
This structure becomes visible in sequencing data as ‘scrambled’ exons
as the co-linearity of genome and transcript is violated. However, the
existence of ‘back-splicing’ junction reads does not prove the circularity

of the transcript of origin. Other mechanisms (e.g. trans-splicing) may
yield such reads, but only circRNAs are depleted in polyA-enriched
samples and resistant to RNAse R treatment. So far, all available algo-
rithms are using these ‘back-splicing’ reads as a key element in
circRNA detection. As a consequence, detection performance heavily
depends on the employed read mapper and its ability to map circRNA
junction reads to the underlying genome or transcriptome. The two
most recent addition to the circRNA detection tool set are CIRI (Gao
et al., 2015) and KNIFE (Szabo et al., 2015). Other circRNA detecting
pipelines have been published along with research papers but seem to
perform worse than the two in the corresponding benchmarks.

Speciﬁc identification and quantification of circular RNAs

1095

 

It has been recently shown that circRNAs may vary in their
abundance relative to their host gene (Westholm et al., 2014). It is
interesting to statistically discern cases where circRNA and linear
isoform expression are tightly coupled from the ones where expres-
sion diverges between the two. To this end, read counts over the
back-splice junction are typically used as an estimate of circRNA ex-
pression and read counts from exons or linear splice junctions as an
estimate of the host gene expression.

2 Results
2.1 Efficient circular RNA detection by DCC

We motivate our circRNA detection workﬂow from the review
paper of Lasda and Parker (2014). Essentially, we are looking for
chimeric read alignments, which are reported by the fast and splice-
aware read mapper STAR (Dobin et al., 2013). Our method works
with single and paired-end data and executes a sequence of analysis
steps as outlined in Supplementary Figure S2 and below:

1. If paired end reads are available, mapping of mates must be con-
sistent with a circular RNA template.

2. Filtering by minimal number of junction reads per biological
replicates to suppress ‘noisy’ candidates.

3. Test for presence of canonical GT/AG splicing signal at circRNA
junction borders. Candidates with non-canonical splicing signals
are discarded.

4. Removal of back-splicing events that map to the mitochondrial
genome.

5. Suppression of mapping artefacts by masking candidates from
repetitive or homologous regions.

6. We report new alternative linear splicing events (circle skipping
junctions) if detected (see Supplementary Fig. SS).

As a result set, we report identified candidate circles by genomic co-
ordinates, gene locus annotation, type of circularization and overlap
with gene body annotation (see Supplementary Tables 51—53).

2.2 Beta-Binomial for modelling circular RNA
expression

We employ a beta-binomial model downstream of the circRNA de-
tection and read counting to model changes in circRNA expression
relative to that of the host gene. We assume that the observed read
counts either originate from linear or circular isoforms. Suppose we
have k groups (e.g. age groups) and each group has m replicates. We
define {(x,,-,n,-,~) : i: 1, ,m;/' = 1, ,k} as the set of relevant
read counts for a given candidate circular RNA junction where x,,- is
the number of back-spliced reads and 11,-,- is the number of all reads
(circRNA plus linear plus pre-mRNA). We assume that x,- (the num-
ber of circular junction read counts for group 7') follows a binomial
distribution with 11 trials and probability of success 0. We further as-
sume that the parameter 0 of the binomial distribution follows a
beta distribution with pseudocounts or and If. This leads to an analyt-
ically tractable compound distribution where one can think of the
parameter of the binomial distribution as being randomly drawn
from a beta distribution (Skellam, 1948):

0 ~ Beta(oc,ﬁ);x,- ~ Bin(n, 0)

We are interested in testing whether the mean u = oc(oc + ﬁ)_1 of the
distribution differs between the respective groups 7' E 1, . . . ,k. Our
null hypothesis states that there is no difference between group
means M1 = u2 =  2 uk while overdispersion is the same for all
groups. The alternative hypothesis states that there is heterogeneity

across group means. We select between the two alternative hypothe-
ses with a likelihood ratio test (ANOVA). All relevant routines are
implemented in the R package CircTest, which depends on the
aod packages Lesnoff et al. (2012).

2.3 Benchmark of DCC

We contrast the performance of DCC with CIRI and KNIFE on several
RNA-seq datasets (see Data section in Supplementary Text). In prin-
ciple, true positive circRNAs are resistant to RNase R treatment, and
thus the same circRNA should be detectable from RNase R treated
samples as well as from rRNA-depleted total RNA-seq samples.
Especially, the CircleSeq protocol (Jeck and Sharpless, 2014) provides
a gold standard as it involves RNase R treatment, which will partially
digest linear isoforms, while circRNAs are preferentially retained. For
simplicity, we define circRNA candidates that were predicted from
both experiments (CircleSeq and rRNA-depleted) as true positives
(TP), whereas candidates that are just predicted from rRNA-depleted
RNA-seq libraries were defined as false positives (FP). We acknowledge
the fact that incomplete RNAse R digestion of linear isoforms may
lead to mis-classifications in this simple scheme. Figure 1A shows the
benchmark results for RNA-seq data from whole mouse brain. DCC
predicts fewer circRNA candidates than KNIFE. However, the preci-
sion (TP/(TP + FP)) of DCC is much higher (97%) than the one of CIRI
and KNIFE with 89% and 41%, respectively. Intriguingly, the total
number of true positive predictions from DCC (2744) is highest on this
particular data set. Similar results were obtained for another dataset
(see Supplementary Text and Supplementary Fig. S6). Supplementary
Figure S4 provides more details on prediction performance and
overlap. DCC is implemented in python 2.7, was extensively tested on
Mac OS and Linux systems and runs considerably faster than CIRI
(see Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.4 Host gene independent regulation of circRNA
abundance with development

We used DCC subsequently to study circRNA abundance in animal de-
velopment and quantified relative changes of circRNA versus host gene
expression based on read count data (see Supplementary Fig. Sl)
with our Ci rcTest package. Brieﬂy, we used the rRNA-depleted total
RNA-seq data from Westholm et al. (2014) and focused on brain sam-
ples from 3 developmental stages (1 day, 4 days and 20 days) across 6
biological replicates. We tested circRNA candidates that were present
in at least 6 out of 18 samples with at least 5 junction spanning reads
for divergent expression to the host gene. From the initial 116 circRNA
candidates, 72 of the circRNAs were significant (P-value £0.05 after
correction for multiple testing, see Supplementary Table S4).

Westholm et al. (2014) reported on relative circRNA expression
changes as measured by qPCR ratio for four selected genes. Three of
them (An/e2, scro, p120ctn) ranked top in our list of significant
host-independent circRNAs and CaMKI ranked 22th (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Table S4). Our results show the same age-dependant
increase as in Westholm et al. (2014), Figure 7E.

3 Discussion

We present a software tandem for circRNA detection (DCC) and rela-
tive quantiﬁcation (CircTest). We could show that DCC has a higher
precision than its competitors for single and paired-end data sets.
Moreover, we adapt a statistical framework based on the beta-binomial
distribution for identifying host gene independent changes in circRNA
expression. Additional information are provided in Supplementary Text.

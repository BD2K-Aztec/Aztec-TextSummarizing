Abstract

Motivation: The identification of ligand—binding sites from a protein structure facilitates computa—
tional drug design and optimization, and protein function assignment. We introduce AutoSite: an
efficient software tool for identifying ligand—binding sites and predicting pseudo ligand correspond—
ing to each binding site identified. Binding sites are reported as clusters of 3D points called fills in
which every point is labelled as hydrophobic or as hydrogen bond donor or acceptor. From these
fills AutoSite derives feature points: a set of putative positions of hydrophobic—, and hydrogen—
bond forming ligand atoms.

Results: We show that AutoSite identifies ligand—binding sites with higher accuracy than other
leading methods, and produces fills that better matches the ligand shape and properties, than the
fills obtained with a software program with similar capabilities, AutoLigand. In addition, we demon—
strate that for the Astex Diverse Set, the feature points identify 79% of hydrophobic ligand atoms,
and 81% and 62% of the hydrogen acceptor and donor hydrogen ligand atoms interacting with the
receptor, and predict 81.2% of water molecules mediating interactions between ligand and recep—
tor. Finally, we illustrate potential uses of the predicted feature points in the context of lead opti—
mization in drug discovery projects.

1 Introduction

Proteins are involved in a wide variety of biological processes such as
signalling pathways and enzymatic reactions. While structural gen—
omics projects have revealed structures of a large number of proteins,
most of them lack reliable information about their biochemical func—
tions (Mills et 61]., 2015). The identification and characterization of
protein—binding sites can help decipher the function of proteins of un—
known function. The interactions made by protein with ligands are
often exploited in the design of small molecules to inhibit pathogenic,

or overeXpressed proteins involved in a biological process. Binding
site characterization has various potential applications including: fil-
tering databases of ligands, lead compound optimization, template
definition for ligand search and automated docking.

Methods for identifying the locations where ligand molecules are
likely to bind a receptor molecule of known 3D structure can be
classified into three broad categories: (i) methods analyzing evolu—
tionary information (Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008; Stark et 61].,
2004), which exploit the idea that important binding site residues

are conserved for functional reasons; (ii) geometry—based methods
(Dundas et 61]., 2006; Hendlich et 61]., 1997) which identify the
clefts/cavities on the protein surface according to the size and depth
of the pockets; and (iii) energy—based methods (Halgren, 2009;
Harris et 61]., 2008; Hernandez et 61]., 2009; Laurie and Jackson,
2005), which rely on the potential generated by probe atoms or
chemical moieties to determine ligand—binding sites. Surfnet
(Laskowski, 1995) identifies pocket regions in proteins by fitting
spheres in the spaces between protein atoms resulting in groups of
interpenetrating spheres that correspond to the protein—binding sites.
Ligsite (Hendlich et 61]., 1997) places the protein in a Cartesian grid
and scans along the X, y, and z axes and the cube’s diagonals for
solvent accessible areas that are enclosed by protein atoms on both
sides. PocketFinder (An et 61]., 2004) uses van der Waals affinity
map computed with a carbon probe of radius 1.710%. The regions
with larger cumulative values are identified and contoured with a
threshold to identify binding sites. Concavity (Capra et 61]., 2009)
provides its own implementation of the LigSite, Surfnet, and
Pocketfinder algorithms and combines them with evolutionary se—
quence conservation data to improve the accuracy of binding site
prediction. Concavity’s implementations of these algorithms when
evolutionary information is not included are named LigSite+,
Surfnet—I— and Pocketﬂnder+. These programs report the binding
sites as a collection of 3D points selected from a regular 3D grid.
Binding site characterization methods analyze an identified binding
site to provide more detailed information about the physicochemical
properties of potential ligands. Several review papers (Ghersi and
Sanchez, 2011; Henrich et 61]., 2010; Perot et 61]., 2010) provide a de—
tailed analysis of computational approaches for identifying and
characterizing protein—binding sites. These methods often character—
ize binding sites based on the amino acid composition of the recep—
tor around the cavity, and properties computed at the binding site
such as solvation, hydrophobicity, and electrostatics. A common ap—
proach to characterize the binding site is by generating affinity
grids(Goodford, 1985; Huey et 61]., 2007) using different probe
atoms at the binding site—a concept exploited by energy—based
approaches in identifying binding sites, and analysing the binding
site by 1) docking fragments (Jain, 2003) 2) condensing the inter-
actions into discrete pharmacophore points (Baroni et 61]., 2007;
Halgren, 2009) or 3) applying geometric rules (Lower et 61]., 2011;
Lower and Proschak, 2011). The characterization heavily relies on
the binding site information and hence these techniques are often
combined with custom or existing binding site identification algo—
rithms with or without emphasis on the shape of the ligand—binding
region. The obtained pharmacophore points are used to compare
and annotate the function of proteins, or used in virtual screening
experiments for drug design. AutoLigand (Harris et 61]., 2008) is a
software program that places emphasis on chemically detailed lig-
and shape prediction when identifying the ligand—binding sites. It
works on the hypothesis that protein—binding sites have evolved to
create a region of maximal affinity for the given size and shape of a
binding ligand. It identifies a contiguous region of maximal-binding
affinity by growing a cluster of contiguous, high—energy points from
on a grid of potential values obtained by combining affinity maps
from multiple atom—types. The resulting cluster of grid points yields
a prediction of ligand shape and each fill point of the predicted bind—
ing sites is associated with an AutoDoc/e atom type. Although the
above described approaches attempts to characterize the binding site
to provide information about governing interactions between pro—
tein and ligand at the binding site, there is no available study to the
best of our knowledge that assess their quality of prediction with
existing ligand(s) that binds to the respective binding site.

Here, we present AutoSite, a new energy—based method for iden—
tifying ligand-binding sites and predicting potential pseudo—ligand in
each of the predicted binding site of a protein structure. Contrary to
AutoLigand, AutoSite filters out low affinity points from affinity
maps computed with hydrophobic (carbon) and hydrophilic (oxygen,
hydrogen) atomtypes to select high affinity points, merges the selected
points, and predicts feature points corresponding to potential ligand
atoms by applying knowledge—based and geometric rules. We show
that AutoSite performs equally to or slightly better than the state—of—
the—art energy— and geometry—based binding site identification meth-
ods. We further demonstrate that AutoSite outperforms AutoLigand
in the accuracy of labeling fill points as hydrophobic, hydrogen bond
donor/acceptor atoms and in the coverage of ligand atoms. Finally,
we introduce putative ligand atomic centres called feature points
derived from the AutoSite fill points. We show that for the Astex
Diverse Set, these feature points correctly identify 79.3% of hydro—
phobic ligand atoms as well as 81.4% and 62.9% of the ligand hydro—
gen acceptor and donor hydrogen atoms that interact with the
receptor, and predict 81.2% of water molecules that interact both
with ligand and receptor. In addition, we illustrate potential uses of
the predicted feature points in the context of drug discovery projects.

2 Methods

AutoSite is an energy—based method for identifying and characteriz-
ing ligand-binding pockets on receptors and deriving feature points
corresponding to putative ligand atoms. It relies on potentials gener—
ated by receptor atoms on grid points to identify clusters corres—
ponding to potential binding sites, and geometric measures for
ranking these binding sites. AutoSite uses AutoDoc/e (Morris et 61].,
2009) affinity maps computed using AutoGrid4 (Huey et 61]., 2007)
for carbon (AutoDock atom type C, hydrophobic), oxygen
(AutoDock atom type OA, hydrogen bond acceptor) and hydrogen
(AutoDock atom type HD, hydrogen bond donor) atom types to
identify binding sites. These maps are regularly spaced grids where
each grid point yields the sum of the pairwise interaction energies
between a probe—atom of a given type with all receptor atoms. The
maps include atom—specific affinities and do not include electro—
statics and charge—based desolvation. AutoSite computes maps cov—
ering the entire receptor, and selects high affinity points from each
map based on probe—specific affinity cutoffs. It then merges the three
sets of high affinity points into a composite map by selecting the
minimum value at each grid position (Fig. 1) . The selected grid
points are then clustered to define potential binding sites.

Afﬁnity cutoffs: The AutoSite algorithm relies on affinity cut-off
values used to identify high affinity grid points. The cutoff value of
—0.3 kcal/mol for the carbon affinity map has been used by us
(Ravindranath et 61]., 2015) and others (Ghersi and Sanchez, 2009) as
it selects grid points covering ligands atoms. The donor (HD) and ac—
ceptor cutoffs (OA), —0.66kcal/mol and —0.5 kcal/mol respectively,

were obtained by analyzing affinity maps computed for the 189
receptor—ligand complexes from the AutoDoc/e calibration dataset
(Huey et al., 2007) as follows. First, hydrogen (HD) and oxygen (OA)
affinity maps were computed using Auto Grid4. The maps were sized
to cover the entire receptor and computed using a grid spacing of 1A.
Next, hydrogen donor atoms (HD) and hydrogen acceptor atoms
(OA—oxygen, SA—sulphur, and NA—nitrogen) contributing to the solv—
ent excluded surface computed using MSMS (Sanner et al., 1996)
were identified. For each of solvent—accessible hydrogen—bond capable
receptor atom, the best affinity grid point within 2.5A of the atom
was recorded in the partner affinity map (i.e. the OA map for hydro-
gen donor atoms and the HD map for hydrogen acceptor atoms)
yielding a distribution of affinity values in the vicinity of surface re—
ceptor donor and acceptor atoms. The averages of these two distribu—
tions are —0.66kcal/mol for the OA grid points in the vicinity of a
receptor hydrogen donor atom, and —0.50kcal/mol for the HD grids
points in the vicinity of a receptor hydrogen acceptor OA atom. The
vdW term of the AutoDoc/e energy function used by AutoGrid to
compute affinity maps for non—hydrogen ligand atoms provides an
average of about —0.3 to —0.5 kcal/mol. For hydrogen bonding atoms
the value is approximately —0.6 kcal/mol for a single hydrogen bond
and approximately twice of —0.6 kcal/mol for oxygen atoms that ac—
cept two hydrogen bonds (Huey et al., 2007). The values can be any—
where less than or equal to the reported value on a grid. Thus the
considered cutoff for hydrophobic (—0.3 kcal/mol), hydrogen ac—
ceptor (—0.66 kcal/mol) and donor (—0.50 kcal/mol) respects the
magnitude of energy terms that corresponds to the hydrophobic and
hydrogen—bonding interactions.

The composite map is obtained by merging the highest affinity
grid points from the three maps into a single set of grid points. If a
grid point has an identical high affinity in more than one map, the
atom type assignment follows the order: C, OA, HD. The rationale
behind this order is that hydrophobic groups govern the shape of the
ligand and hence it is given the highest priority; followed by hydro—
gen acceptor that are specific and directional and hence expected to
be highly accurate, and finally the donor whose contribution is es—
sential for hydrogen bonding but becomes uncertain on designed lig—
ands due to their physicochemical properties.

Density-based clustering: High affinity grid points are clustered
to partition the points into contiguous sets, each set corresponding
to a potential binding site. This clustering is performed using a
modified implementation of the DBSCAN algorithm (Ester et al.,
1996). DBSCAN uses a local density cutoff value to grow clusters,
and is known for its ability to handle noise (i.e. isolated points).
AutoSite exploits the fact that the points to be clustered are located
on a grid to replace the DBSCAN local density calculation by a sim—
ple count of neighbouring grid points. A given grid point will be
added to a growing cluster if it has at least N neighbouring grid
points in the set of high affinity grid points. Intuitively, N controls
the minimum width of channels connecting a collection of compact
points. Lower values of N allow cluster to have more protrusions
and grow larger, while larger values of N generate more compact
clusters. The clustering of a set P of high affinity grid points, for a
minimum number of neighbours N is performed as follows. A point
S is selected randomly from P as a seed point. If S has at least N
neighbours in the set, S and all its neighbours are added to the clus—
ter seeded by S. S is marked as treated and removed from the set P,
and the seed S and its neighbours that do not yet belong to a cluster
are added to the cluster. The test for number of neighbours is per-
formed for every un-treated point in the cluster, potentially adding
more points to the cluster, until all points in the cluster have been
treated. After a cluster is completed, a new point S is selected from P

as a seed for a new cluster, until P is empty. On a cubic grid, a point
has a maximum of 26 neighbours. We identified 14 as the best value
for the minimum number of neighbours N by maximizing the
Jaccard/Tanimoto coefficient (Jaccard, 1901) between the 189 lig—
ands of the AutoDoc/e calibration set and fills obtained for values of
N ranging from 12 to 17. The Jaccard coefficient is used to compare
the similarity of two shapes as the ratio of the intersection over the
union of the two shapes. As the fills are clusters of high affinity
points located on a 3D grid, we discretized the ligand atomic—
spheres onto the same grid using atomic radii from the AutoDoc/e4
parameters set to obtain ligand shape as a set of grid points. The
Jaccard coefficient is calculated as the ratio of the total of intersect—
ing grid points over the total of union of intersecting and non—
intersecting points from discretized ligand and reported fill.

Pocket ranking: The fills identified by clustering are ranked using
a geometry—based score. Like most site—finding software programs,
AutoSite computes a variety of numerical descriptors for each fill,
including: affinity, number of points, efficiency (i.e. affinity/vol—
ume), and radius of gyration. In addition, we compute fill buriedness
by dividing the fill’s buried surface area by the fill’s total surface
area. This value ranges from 1.0 for a fill entirely buried by the re—
ceptor (i.e. an enclosed cavity) to 0.0 for a fill entirely exposed to
solvent. The buriedness is calculated numerically in AutoSite as fol—
lows. First, we identify the set of grid points covered by ligand
atomic spheres augmented by 1.0A. Next the grid points covered by
the ligand atomic spheres with their original radii are removed from
this set, yielding a shell of grid points around the ligand. The num-
ber of grid points in this shell, N t is used as a numerical approxima—
tion of the fill’s total surface area. Next, the receptor atomic
spheres, with a radius augmented by 1.0, are used to tag as “buried”
grid points in the surface shell. The buriedness is calculated as the
ratio of the number of buried surface shell grid points over Nt. We
rank the fills using an empirical composite score in which the fill
size (i.e. number of points) is multiplied by the square of its buried—
ness and divided by the radius of gyration. This metric was designed
to favour fills that have large volumes with compact buried cavities.

AutoSite’s ability to identify the binding site was evaluated with
the Astex Diverse Set (Hartshorn et al., 2007). This dataset contains
85 well—curated proteins—ligand complexes with ligands that have
drug—like properties. This set has no overlap with the AutoDock’s
calibration dataset and thus the predictions have no training bias.
The proteins from the dataset were converted to the AutoDock’s
PDBQT format and gasteiger charges were assigned. AutoSite’s
performance was compared with LigSite—I—, Surfnet—I— and
Pocketfinder—I—. These programs were run with their default param-
eters as documented by Concavity and the resulting predictions were
ranked by volume which is the default ranking metric for these three
programs. The success rates of all programs were assessed with
Jaccard coefficient at cutoffs 0.0, 0.1, 0.25 and 0.5.

Binding site characterization: While LigSite—I—, Surfnet—I— and
Pocketfinder—I— report pockets as a collection of un—typed 3D points,
AutoSite fill points are labelled as hydrophobic, hydrogen bond
donor and acceptor points. AutoLigand and FLAP (Baroni et al.,
2007) are other software programs that predict typed fills. We were
unable to obtain a license to test FLAP, hence we evaluated the merit
of our method by comparing the typed fills predicted by AutoSite
with the ones predicted by AutoLigand on the Astex Diverse Set.
The fills were generated for both programs using the same carbon,
oxygen and hydrogen affinity maps. These maps were calculated
using AutoGrid4 as cubic grids of 27  on a side (including a pad—
ding of 2A) and centred on the ligand, with a grid spacing of 1A. By
default, AutoLigand initiates fill starting from 3D points randomly

picked on the grid. As we are interested in comparing fills that over—
lap with the ligand, we ran AutoLigand using the ligand geometric
centre as the starting point for the fill. We ran the program for num-
bers of fill points ranging from 10 to 1500 in increments of 10. The
fill with the best energy—per—volume was picked as the AutoLigand
prediction. The AutoSite program was executed with the default
parameters (i.e. affinity cutoffs of —0.3kcal/mol for C, —0.66 kcal/
mol for O and —0.5 kcal/mol for H, and 14 minimum number of
neighbours for clustering) and the predicted fill closest to the ligand
geometric centre was considered for comparison.

Feature Points

AutoSite converts the fills points into putative hydrophobic, or
hydrogen-bond forming ligand atoms. For hydrophobic fill points
we use k—means clustering for dividing the fill points into compact
clusters of fill points representing a pre—defined number of carbon
atoms. A survey of the ligands of the Astex Diverse Set revealed that
on average carbon atoms cover 14.3 grid points for grids of spacing
1A. This average was found to be highly stable when the grid was
translated by small amounts in random directions (data not shown).
We cluster the hydrophobic fill points to form Nbp/14 clusters,
where N/op is the number of hydrophobic fill points. The centres of
the resulting clusters are used as atomic centres for putative hydro—
phobic atoms. Putative hydrogen bond donors (HD) and hydrogen-
bond acceptor (OA) ligand atoms are identified as follows. Every fill
point of type HD is associated with all receptor OA located within
2.5  and every fill point of type 0A is associated with all receptor
HD atoms located within 2.5  Next, for each of these receptor
atoms the associated fill point with the best affinity (i.e. putative
atom centre) is selected as a feature point. The result of this process
is a set of putative ligand atoms. Figure 2 illustrates this process
using an actual fill generated for the streptavidin receptor.

3 Results

The binding site identification results summarized in Table 1 show
that AutoSite performs comparably or better than the other four
programs. With fill overlap ratio (Jaccard coefficient) > 0.1 as the
cutoff, AutoSite identified 58 binding sites in the top prediction cor—
rectly out of 85 compared to 54 for LigSite—i—, 43 for Surfnet—l—, 44
for PocketFinder—i— and 56 for SiteHound. Considering the top three
binding site predictions for each system, AutoSite identified 76 bind—
ing sites compared to 74 for LigSite—i—, 61 for Surfnet—i—, 62 for
Pocketfinder—i— and 72 for SiteHound.

The programs were tested using different Jaccard coefficient
thresholds, and AutoSite showed to generate more fills with Jaccard
Coefficients greater than 0.0, 0.1 and 0.25 than other programs,
indicating better coverage of the ligand both in top prediction as
well as when considering Top 3 predictions. SiteHound was found
to do better than LigSite—i— in Top 1 at both threshold >01
and >0.25. LigSite—i— and Surfnet—i— found 6 and 8 systems in Top1,
and 10 and 11 systems in Top3 out of 85 respectively, with Jaccard
coefficient >0.5 compared to 3 by AutoSite both in Top1 and Top3
predictions. Visual analysis of AutoSite predicted fills corresponding
to the 12 systems that did not get >0.5 Jaccard coefficient, showed
that they overlap well with the ligand except in 2 cases (117f — 0.17;
1vcj — 0.21), where AutoSite predicts only part of the ligand. The
consistency demonstrated by AutoSite in success rate shows that the
fills produced by AutoSite have better overlap with the ligand in
addition to identifying the correct binding sites.

The comparison of the binding site characterization performed
by AutoLigand and AutoSite is shown in Figure 3. Figure 3A plots
the percentage of systems as a function of the Jaccard coefficient of
the fills produced by both programs. We observe a substantial in—
crease in the number of fills with better Jaccard coefficients for
AutoSite, with 64.7% of the fills having a Jaccard coefficient > 0.3
compared to 23.5% for AutoLigand fills. The average Jaccard coef—
ficient for AutoSite and AutoLigand were found to be 0.34 and
0.21, respectively. The relatively low values of the Jaccard coeffi—
cients can be explained by the fact that ligands do not always exploit
the entire binding pocket, hence, the predicted fills tend to extend
beyond the ligand as discussed below in the discussion where the
predicted fill cover regions corresponding to different known lig-
ands. Small Jaccard coefficients can arise when the overlap between
the fill and the ligand is small or when the fill extends far beyond the
ligand, or both. To investigate the results further, we analyzed the
fill sizes and the overlap with the ligands separately. It should be
noted that while the Jaccard coefficient is computed using a ligand
discretized on a grid identical to the affinity maps, the percentage
of ligand overlap is computed with the ligand atom coordinates.
Figure 3B shows the volume of the fills sorted by decreasing size of
the AutoSite fills. For 77 out of 85 ligands (90%), AutoSite fills are

larger than the AutoLigand fills with an average of 150 more points
per fill as indicated by the distribution of fill size differences in the
inset. To analyze the overlap of the fill with the ligand, we computed
the distance between every ligand atom and the closest fill point.
Figure 3C shows that 91.5% of ligand atoms are within 2.0  of a
fill point, compared to 72.4% for AutoLigand. We further segre—
gated ligand atoms into hydrophobic (C, A, N, S, P), hydrogen ac—
ceptors (OA, NA, SA) and hydrogen donor (HD) atoms and
computed the distance of each ligand atom to the closest fill point of
the appropriate type. The ligands have 90.8% hydrophobic, 68.6%
hydrogen acceptors, and 65.7% for hydrogen donor atoms within 2
A of an AutoSite fill point of the proper type, compared to the
71.7%, 44.7% and 20.1% for AutoLigand fills, respectively. These
results indicate that AutoSite fills, while larger, have a better overlap
with the ligand and as such offer a more accurate depiction of the
ligand as predicted from the receptor structure.

Beyond the labeling of fill points in the predicted binding sites,
AutoSite predicts the number and positions of potential ligand
atoms interacting with the receptor in this binding site. Examples of
such predicted feature points from fill points are shown in Figure 4
for PDB ids 1stp and 1hps. Fig. 4A and 4C shows the starting fill
points for streptavidin and HIV—1 protease. Figure 4B shows that

the predicted hydrogen bond acceptor feature points (red spheres)
overlap with the oxygen and sulphur atoms, hydrogen bond donor
feature points (yellow spheres) are in close proximity to nitrogen
atoms that are known to be protonated in the bound form, and the
hydrophobic feature points overlay well with the carbon atoms. Our
method performs particularly well on this ligand, as it is highly po-
tent with a binding affinity of 40 fM. Figure 4D shows another ex—
ample of feature points for the site predicted for the binding site of
an HIV-1 protease inhibitor (PDB id 1hps). The cross—shaped pep—
tide geometry found in many HIV protease inhibitors and most
hydrogen bonding ligand atoms are identified by the feature points.
In particular the strong hydrogen bond acceptor preference identi—
fied at the centre of the fill is a common interaction observed in
HIV-1 proteases. This position is known to accommodate a water
molecule, which is displaced in cyclic urea inhibitors by an oxygen
atom (Harris et al., 2008). The phenyl group in the ligand that is not
covered by the feature points doesn’t show any strong interaction
with the receptor in the crystal structure. The feature points pre—
dicted for 20 other protease structures yielded the cross—shaped
geometry as described above and tends to identify the key inter-
actions (Supplementary information SFig.1). Figure 4 shows ligands
that have excellent overlap with the predicted fills. Hence we see re—
markably good agreement between the number of atoms in ligands
and the predicted number of feature points. In Table 2, we report
the correlation between number of ligand atoms and the number of
predicted feature points for the Astex diverse dataset at increasing
cutoff values of the Jaccard Coefficient. The correlation increases
with the increase in the overlap ratio, and with the cutoff of the
average Jaccard coefficient obtained by AutoSite (0.34) we get a cor—
relation coefficient of 0.74. The analysis includes ligand hydrogen
atoms, and it is noteworthy that the Astex diverse set contains
manually curated ligands for corresponding proteins.

In order to quantify the ability of AutoSite’s predicted feature
points to match with actual ligand atoms we computed the distance
from each ligand atom to the closest matching feature point. Table 3
shows that over 79% of all hydrophobic ligand atoms have a corres—
ponding hydrophobic feature point within 2A. The percentages for
all ligand hydrogen-bond forming atoms are 41% for acceptor
atoms and 46% for donor hydrogen atoms respectively. Given that

are considered.

the feature points are derived from fill points, which are high affinity
points for the receptor, the method is expected to only predict the
subset of ligand hydrogen bond forming atoms that actually interact
with the receptor. Performing the analysis considering only the lig-
and atoms involved in a hydrogen bond with a receptor atom (i.e.
distance <2.5A) the percentages of ligand atoms with a fill point
within 2A of a feature point increase to 81.4% for acceptor atoms
and to 62.9% for donor hydrogen atoms. Although a decrease in the
percentage ligand overlap is expected when extracting representative
feature points from fill points, the result provides scope for further
optimization to the extraction procedure. In this analysis, we considered
the AutoDoc/e4 atom types (C, A, N, S, P) as hydrophobic, (OA, NA,
SA) as acceptor atoms, and HD as donor atoms. In the Astex Diverse
Set, 72% of ligands atoms are hydrophobic, 15.1% acceptor atoms,
and 10.9% hydrogen bond donor atoms (HD). Another 2% of ligand
atoms are halogen atoms (Cl, Br, F) and were ignored for this analysis.
Predicted hydrogen bonding feature points should also identify
crystallographic water positions. To verify this hypothesis, we pro—
tonated the receptors of the Astex Diverse Set that included water
molecules using What If web server (Vriend, 1990), and selected
water molecules within 2.5A of the ligand. We found that 38.3% of
the oxygen atoms, 30.8% of the hydrogen atoms of these selected
water molecules found corresponding feature point within 2A
(Table 4A). When including only water molecules within 2.5A of
both the receptors and ligand, AutoSite predicts 58% of the oxygen
and 41.3% of the hydrogen atoms of these water molecules
(Table 4A). Since the prediction gets only hydrogen bond inter—
actions between the receptor and atoms that are at a distance of
2.5A, we further analyzed (Table 4B) the percentage of oxygen
atoms in water molecules that finds either a hydrogen or an oxygen
feature point within 3.5A (maximum interaction distance between
hydrogen bonding heavy atoms). The result showed that 81.2% per—
centage of the oxygen atoms from the water molecules mediating
interaction between a receptor and ligand, have a feature point
within 3.5A. Examples in Supplementary information (SFig. 2)

oxygen and hydrogen maps takes 34.5 seconds on average for the
Astex diverse set receptors. A custom version of AutoGrid that
allows the exclusion of electrostatics and desolvation maps com—
putes these maps in 4.1 seconds on an average. Thus, AutoSite takes
on average less than 10 seconds to compute the maps, identify the
binding sites with 50 or more fill points and obtain the pseudo lig—
and for each of the predicted sites.

4 Discussion

AutoSite identifies binding sites with higher accuracy than other
leading methods. While it only performs marginally better than
LigSite—i— for binding site identification, it produces labelled points
which can further be used to characterize the binding site. In add—
ition, the Astex Diverse Set is a collection of diverse receptors with
geometrically well—defined binding sites, often buried cavities, which
overall favours geometry based methods like LigSite—i—. Similar to
AutoLigand, AutoSite fill points are annotated as hydrophobic,
hydrogen—bond acceptor or donor hydrogen atoms. The comparison
of labelled fills produced by these two programs was performed
using AutoLigand fills seeded at the ligand geometric centre to en—
sure an overlap between the fill and the ligand and the AutoSite fill
with the point closest to the ligand geometric centre. It is note—
worthy that 59 out of the 85 AutoSite fills selected for this analysis
also are the top ranking fills obtained for a grid spanning the entire
receptor. Moreover, 81 of the AutoSite fills selected for this analysis
are the top ranking fills obtained for the smaller 27x27x27A3 boxes.
AutoSite was shown to outperform AutoLigand by covering more
ligand atoms. The fills identified by AutoSite tend to be larger than
the ligand bound to the receptor. This is because ligands exploit a
subset of the possible interactions with the receptor as exemplified
by Chitinase, which binds the cyclic GLY-PRO fragment (PDB id
1w1p) as well as a natural—product cyclopentapeptide (argadin)
(PDB id 1h0g) and the CI4 inhibitor (PDB id 106i). The cyclic GLY-
PRO fragment bound structure was part of the study to understand
the mechanism of inhibition by cyclic dipeptide inhibitors of chiti-
nase, which is involved in chitin degradation(Houston et al., 2004)
and only occupies a small portion of the fill. Argidin binds to the (+)
sub—sites of the enzymes (Houston et al., 2002) and the CI4 inhibitor

prefers the (—) sub—sites of the enzyme (Houston et al., 2004) thus
each inhibitor occupying one half of the fill (Supplementary informa
tion SFig. 3). This illustrates the reason for the fills identified by
AutoSite to be larger than certain ligands. On the other hand, the fill
predicted by AutoLigand only identifies the (—) sub—sites of chitinase.
For another class of receptors, we observe that AutoSite generates
multiple smaller adjacent clusters. For example, in PDB id 1hwi -
HMG—CoA reductase with Fluvastatin, the five-membered ring in
the ligand acts as a scaffold, which positions three hydrophobic
functional groups that are increasing this ligand’s potency (Istvan
and Deisenhofer, 2001). While fills covering the HMG-like moiety
and the hydrophobic groups are identified, they are disconnected be—
cause the five—membered ring does not interact strongly with the re—
ceptor creating a gap in high affinity points preventing the clustering
algorithm from connecting these fills (Supplementary information
SFig. 4).

The feature points predicted by AutoSite for a given binding site
have several potential applications relevant to medicinal chemistry,
some of which we discuss and illustrate below. Feature points pre—
dict crystallographic water molecules, suggesting that they can po—
tentially be used for designing and optimizing drugs that make use
of the water interactions or that replace the water positions for bind—
ing the receptor.

A recent study by Johnson et al. (Johnson et al., 2015 ) on lead
optimization of inhibitors for MELK (maternal embryonic leucine
zipper kinase) using fragment—based discovery illustrates the poten—
tial use of feature points for lead optimization. The authors opti—
mized a fragment with 160 micromolar affinity using structure
based drug design into a 37 nanomolar inhibitor. We obtained fea—
ture points using AutoSite on the fragment—bound crystal structure
of the receptor (PDB id 4d2w) (Fig. 5A). The predicted putative lig—
and atoms identified the crystallographic water (W1) location, as
well as additional hydrogen bond forming positions. The optimized
nanomolar inhibitor, when superimposed over the AutoSite feature
points (Fig. 5B) occupies two of the predicted hydrogen bond ac—
ceptor spots near nitrogen atoms, leaving one more hydrogen bond

acceptor spot and a few donor spots available. It is interesting to no—
tice that the crystal structure of the nanomolar inhibitor bound pro-
tein (PDB id 4d2v) has a water molecule (W2) interacting with the
ligand nitrogen atom (2.84 A) as well as a second crystallographic
water molecule (W3) (2.65 A). Our method predicts a hydrogen ac—
ceptor atom at the first water molecule (W2) location and a donor
hydrogen atom close by the second water molecule (W3) (Fig. 5C),
indicating that predicted feature points could be used to further opti—
mize the ligand.

Feature points could also potentially be used for protein function
annotation. This could be achieved by keeping track of the receptor
amino acids interacting with feature points and comparing them
with the binding site databases.

Automated docking is another area that could benefit from the
feature points produced by AutoSite. Some docking programs such
as SLIDE (Schnecke et al., 1998), DOCK (Allen et al., 2015), and
Surflex (Jain, 2003) place the ligand into the receptor using tem—
plates of interactions. These programs could benefit from using fea—
ture points generated by AutoSite. Programs such as AutoDoc/eFR
(Ravindranath et al., 2015 ) allow for the explicit representation of
receptor side chains as ﬂexible during docking but require the a-pri-
ori identification of these side chains. Feature points could be used
to select receptor side chains (the ones interacting with the feature
points) to be made ﬂexible. Finally, feature points could be used to
filter large databases of ligands for compounds matching the feature
points.

AutoSite like any energy—based methods will be sensitive to the
translation and orientation of coarse grids. This limitation is attenu—
ated when using smaller grid spacing. Pseudo—ligands derived by
AutoSite for 85 proteins in Astex diverse set, using a grid spacing of
0.375A on cubic boxes of 26.625A on a side and centred on the re—
spective ligands shows improvement in the ligand atoms coverage
by feature points (SFig. 5). AutoSite takes on an average 19 seconds
on Astex diverse set when maps are provided. Hence we recommend
smaller grid spacing only when studying pockets of interest.

5 Conclusion

We have introduced AutoSite, a software program to reliably and ef—
ficiently identify ligand-binding sites for the receptors of known 3D
structure, and characterize them by labeling the fill points as hydro-
phobic, or hydrogen bond donors or acceptors, as well as by deriv—
ing a set of putative ligand atomic positions called feature points.
We have demonstrated that this method identifies binding sites com-
parably or better than other popular binding site identification soft—
ware programs. We also demonstrated that the labelled fill points
produced by AutoSite are larger than the ones produced by
AutoLigand and also have a better overlap with the ligand. Finally,
we have shown that the predicted putative ligand atoms capture
around 80% of ligand hydrophobic and hydrogen acceptor atoms
that interact with the receptor and over 60% of ligand hydrogen
donor atoms, and illustrated and discussed applications of feature
points for rational drug design and optimization. The software is

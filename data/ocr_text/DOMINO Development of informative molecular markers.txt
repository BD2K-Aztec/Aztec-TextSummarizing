Abstract

Motivation: The development of molecular markers is one of the most important challenges in phylo-
genetic and genome wide population genetics studies, especially in studies with non-model organisms.
Highly promising approach for obtaining suitable markers are the utilization of genomic partitioning
strategies for the simultaneous discovery and genotyping of a large number of markers. Unfortunately,
not all markers obtained from these approaches provide enough information for solving multiple evolu-
tionary questions at a reasonable taxonomic resolution.

Results: We have developed DOMINO, a bioinformatics tool for informative marker development from
both NGS data and pre-computed sequence alignments. The application implements popular NGS
tools with new utilities in a highly versatile pipeline speciﬁcally designed to discover or select personal-
ized markers at different levels of taxonomic resolution. These markers can be directly used to study
the taxa surveyed for their design, utilized for further downstream PCR amplification in a broader set
taxonomic scope, or exploited as suitable templates to bait design for target DNA enrichment tech-
niques. We conducted an exhaustive evaluation of the performance of DOMINO via computer simula-
tions and illustrate its utility to ﬁnd informative markers in an empirical dataset.

1 Introduction

It is well known that phylogenetic inferences based on a single or very
few genetic markers can lead to systematic errors and reach invalid
conclusions (Maddison et al., 1997; Brito and Edwards, 2009). Next
generation sequencing O\IGS) has become a feasible and cost-effective

way of obtaining large amounts of genetic markers suitable for address-
ing ecological and evolutionary questions. Among current methodolo-
gies, the hybrid enrichment and the reduction representation sequencing
methods (for a review see Lemon and Lemon, 2013) are particularly
promising approaches for studies in non-model organisms. Markers
developed with these methodologies, however, may not be informative

enough to resolve multiple evolutionary questions across a reasonable
taxonomic range; indeed, some markers may be inefﬁcient for a particu-
lar study in a speciﬁc taxonomic group, or can be useful only for limited
phylogenetic ranges. These problems make often necessary to accom-
plish various cost-intensive enrichment or reduction representation
experiments to ﬁlrther obtain makers suitable to be applicable across a
wide range of species.

Recently, some optimizing approaches have been developed to try to
overcome this limited marker inforrnativeness. For instance, the Mark-
eer'ner 1.0 pipeline (Chamala et al., 2015), outputs different types of
multiple sequence alignments (MSA) ﬁles, some of them including
reference coding sequences containing introns, which facilitates the
downstream evaluation of the phylogenetic utility of each marker or the
prediction of intron-exon boundaries and intron sizes, very useful for
primer or probe of development. Nevertheless, the pipeline does not
perform these assessments by itself and the application is speciﬁcally
devised to work only with transcriptome assemblies and with a set of
plant reference genomes. Indeed, the possibility of selecting particular
markers with a speciﬁc number of samples has been recently implement-
ed in the RAD-Seq data processing pipeline RADIS (Cruaud et al.).
However, this application does not include other key options and param-
eter combinations, such as the selection of a speciﬁc nucleotide variation
range across a set of pre-deﬁned taxa, options that can be very useﬁll for
a plethora of studies. BaitFisher (Mayer et al., 2016) also implements a
novel approach to optimize the design of target enrichment baits to be
applicable across a wide range of taxa. This software includes an algo-
rithm to infer target DNA enrichment baits from multiple taxa by ex-
ploiting user-provided nucleotide sequence information of target loci in a
representative set of species and can handle both genomic and cDNA
data. Nevertheless, this software works on the basis of MSA of already
known target loci that directly serves as templates for bait design (i.e., it
cannot be used with raw NGS data or for de novo marker discovery).

Here we present DOMINO (Development Of Molecular markers In Non-
model Organisms) a new bioinformatics tool that facilitates the devel-
opment of highly informative markers from different data sources,
including raw NGS reads and pre-computed MSA in various formats
(such as those from RAD data). DOMINO efﬁciently process NGS data
or pre-computed MSA and identiﬁes (i.e., de novo discovery) or selects
the sequence regions or alignments that meet user-deﬁned criteria.
Customizable features include the length of variable and conserved
regions (when requested), the minimum levels (or a preferred range) of
nucleotide variation, how to manage polymorphic variants, or which taxa
(or what fraction of them) should be covered by the marker. All these
criteria can be easily deﬁned in a user-ﬁiendly GUI (Graphical User
Interface) or under a command-line version that implements some ex-
tended options and that it is particularly useﬁll for working with large
NGS data sets in high performance computers (Supplementary Fig. S2;
see also the DOMINO documentation). The regions identiﬁed or selected
in DOMINO can be i) directly used as markers with a particular depth of
taxonomic resolution, ii) utilized for their downstream PCR ampliﬁca-
tion in a broader taxonomic scope or iii) used as suitable templates to
optimized bait design for target DNA enrichment techniques.

2 Methods and Implementation
2.1 DOMINO workﬂow

The DOMINO workﬂow consists in four main phases (Fig. 1) that can
be run either using the DOMINO GUI or the extended command-line

version (see the DOMINO manual in the DOMINO Web page). In both
cases, the most relevant results ﬁom each phase are conveniently report-
ed in the appropriate output ﬁles.

Input data and pre-processing phase. DOMINO accepts input sequence
data ﬁles in two different formats, the 454 Pyrosequencing Standard
Flowgram Format (SFF), and FASTQ format (Cock et al., 2010). These
input ﬁles can contain 454 or Illumina (single or paired-end) raw reads
from m taxa (the “taxa panel”). The sequences from each taxon should
be properly identiﬁed with a speciﬁc barcode (aka, tag, MID or index),
or loaded in separate ﬁles, also appropriately named (see the DOMINO
manual in the DOMINO Web site for details). DOMINO is designed to
ﬁlter low quality, low complexity, contaminant and very short reads
using either default or user-speciﬁed ﬁltering parameters. Mothur,
PRINSEQ, NGS QC toolkit, BLAST, as well as new Perl functions
speciﬁcally written for DOMINO (DM scripts) are used to perform these
tasks (Supplementary Table S1). DOMINO uses Mothur v1.32.0
(Schloss et al., 2009) to extract reads ﬁom SFF ﬁles and store them in
FASTQ format, which are subsequently converted to FASTA and QUAL
ﬁles. Low quality or very short reads are trimmed, or deﬁnitely removed,
using NGS QC Toolkit v2.3.1 (Patel and Jain, 2012). PRINSEQ v0.20.3
package (Schmieder and Edwards, 2011) is used to eliminate low com-
plexity reads using the implemented DUST algorithm. Putative contami-
nant sequences, such as bacterial DNA frequently found in genomic
samples (Leese et a1. 2012), cloning vectors, adaptors, linkers, and high-
throughput library preparation primers, can also be removed using a
DOMINO ﬁlnction that performs a BLAST search (BLAST v2.2.28)
(Altschul et al., 1990) against UniVec database
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/tools/vecscreen/univecl) and/or against a
user-supplied contaminant database (see the DOMINO manual).

Assembly phase. When working with just NGS reads, the program ﬁrst
applies an assembly-based approach; the pipeline is therefore optimized
to work with genome partitioning methods in which the length of the
size-selected (or enriched) fragments and the sequencing depth are
enough to permit the assembly of a set of homologous fragments. For
data from restriction-site associated DNA (RAD) sequencing and related
methods see the Mapping/Alignment phase section. DOMINO performs
separate assemblies, one for each panel taxon, using MIRA v4.0.2
(Chevreux, 1999), either with the pre-processed reads from the previous
step or with those supplied by the user. Although the default parameter
values vary in ﬁlnction of the particular sequencing technology, the
majority of them are shared (see the DOMINO manual). In order to
avoid including repetitive and chimeric regions, all contigs (and the
corresponding reads) identiﬁed as repeats in the MIRA algorithm are
discarded from the mapping/alignment phase (Chevreux, 1999). Since
MIRA can generate redundant contigs because of polymorphic and
paralogous regions, we have implemented a speciﬁc DOMINO ﬁlnction
that performs a clustering of all contigs based on an all versus all contigs
BLAST search to identify and remove such redundancies. The DOMINO
command line version (see below) also includes an option to perform a
second iterative assembly step using the software CAP3 (Huang, 1999).
If selected, this option uses MIRA output sequences (contigs and single-
tons) as input for CAP3 under a relaxed parameter scheme.

Mapping/Alignment phase. DOMINO uses Bowtie2 (Langmead and
Salzberg, 2012) to map the pre-processed reads from each taxon to the
assembled contigs of the other m-1 taxa from the panel. Thus, in this
step, DOMINO builds m(m-l) sequence alignment/map ﬁles
(SAM/BAM ﬁles. In the case of a panel of m = 4 taxa, for example,

9mg ‘09 1sn8nV uo seleﬁuV soq ‘BIIIJOJHBQ JO [QISJQAIII [1 112 [310'SIBIIJHO[plOJXO'SODBIILIOJIIIOIQ/[Z(11111 moi; pepeolumoq

DOMINO will build 4 x 3 = 12 SAM/BAM ﬁles during this step. The
reason behind this particular mapping strategy lies in the dissimilar
performance of alignment/mapping algorithms depending on the diver-
gence between the reads and the reference sequences. Immediately after
generating BAM ﬁles, DOMINO removes all unmapped contigs and
multi-mapping reads. This step is critical to avoid alignment artifacts,
which can create false positive markers (i.e., sequence regions with
misleading high levels of nucleotide diversity). The contigs with an
unusually large number of aligned reads, which can correspond to repeti-
tive regions, are also removed (they are not suitable for designing single
copy markers) Later, DOMINO will build one pileup ﬁle per each
BAM/SAM ﬁle using the SAMtools v0.1.19 suite (mpz'leup option) (Li et
al., 2009).

Since sequencing errors might have a great effect on the marker selec-
tion, DOMINO incorporates their own functions for detecting and mask-
ing putative sequencing errors, which apply a very conservative criterion
for variant calling. First, to avoid the calling of spurious nucleotide
variants in low sequencing coverage experiments (i.e. erroneously as-
signed variants ﬁxed between the taxa from the panel), DOMINO mask
the information ﬁom positions with only one read mapped to the refer-
ence. Furthermore, sequencing errors may also inﬂate the number of
called polymorphisms under the Polymorphic Variants option in the
marker identiﬁcation/selection phase. To avoid such undesirable effect,
DOMINO incorporates a similar conservative criterion to use only
highly credible polymorphisms. Under the Polymorphic Variant option,
DOMINO will assume that each taxon represents a diploid individual;
for positions with eight or more reads mapped, DOMINO discards those
polymorphic variants in which the frequency of the minor allele is
signiﬁcantly lower than the expected under error free data (hence, in
absence of sequencing errors the distribution of observed nucleotide
counts at each position would follow a binomial distribution). For lower
coverage values, DOMINO will use the information of a polymorphic
variant only if the allele with the minor frequency is present in two or
more reads. This testing procedure, applied independently for each
position within each species, will likely discard some true polymorphic
sites; this variant calling approach, however, makes DOMINO highly
conservative in detecting true markers when including polymorphisms in
the analysis (i.e., DOMINO will use only highly conﬁdent within-species
segregating variants for the marker Discovery/ Selection phase). Ambigu-
ity codes, either introduced by MIRA assembler in contig sequences or
present in user-supplied reference sequences or MSA, are also consid-
ered by DOMINO to decide whether a position is or not variable.

After applying all the above-mentioned post-mapping ﬁlters, DOMINO
combines the variation proﬁles (arrays with the information about the
state of each position, conserved or variable between taxa pairs) obtained
ﬁom each of the m-1 pileup ﬁles including the same reference sequence
(i.e., the same taxon), into a single multiple taxa variation proﬁle
(MTVP). Since each of these references will be likely fragmented in i
contigs, DOMINO will build 1’ x m MTVP per taxon. Each of these
MTVP will be independently scanned for regions containing candidate
markers in the next phase. If the user provides reference sequences from
a single taxon (e. g. a genome draft), plus the reads ﬁom the m different
taxa, the program builds only one MTVP set (one per contig or scaffold
in the supplied reference). On the other hand, if the input includes a
single or multiple pre-computed MSA instead of NGS data, DOMINO
skips the alignment/mapping phase and directly generates the single
MTVP set (one per aligned region). In this point, the program accepts

MSA ﬁles in FASTA (multiple FASTA ﬁles, one per linked region),
PHYLIP (multiple PHYLIP ﬁles, one per linked region, or one multi
PHYLIP ﬁle with the alignment of all regions) and pyRAD LOCI (*.loci
ﬁles generated by the program pyRAD; Eaton, 2014) and STACKS fasta
(batch_X.fa output ﬁles generated from the population analyses in the
program STACKS; Catchen et al., 2011) output ﬁles.

Marker Discovery/Selection phase. Each MTVP generated in the previ-
ous step is either scanned for the presence of candidate marker regions
using a sliding window approach (DOMINO marker discovery module),
or used to select markers (with the desired features) among the MSA
loaded in the previous tab (DOMINO marker selection module). In the
ﬁrst case, a speciﬁc DOMINO ﬁlnction searches for sequence regions of
desired length (Variable region Length, VL), showing the minimum
level of variation indicated by the user (Variable region Divergence,
VD). DOMINO can also restrict that this variable region was ﬂanked (or
not) by highly conserved regions (Conserved region Divergence, CD) of
a predeﬁned length (Conserved region Length, CL); an information
useﬁll to ﬁlrther design PCR primers. Moreover, DOMINO can strictly
restrict the search to a particular set of taxa (from the panel), or just
specify the minimum number of taxa required to be covered by the
marker (by changing the Minimum number of Covering Taxa parameter;
MCT < m). As indicated, DOMINO can use or not the information ﬁom
polymorphic sites. An appropriated combination of selected taxa and
MCT and VD parameter values will allow the user select a large set of
informative markers suitable to be applicable across a wide range of
taxa. In the second case, the DOMINO selection module allows directly
selecting the most informative markers among the loaded by the user in
the same way and with the same personalized features described above.
For RAD loci, a particular range of variable positions (VP) between the
closest taxa (instead of the VD parameter) must be speciﬁed. This option
allows selecting informative RAD loci while excluding those exhibiting
anomalous high levels of variation, which might reﬂect RAD tag cluster-
ing errors. The speciﬁc selection of a set of loci/MSA that meet some
speciﬁc phylogenetic criteria using the DOMINO selection module can
be very helpful to ﬁlrther design probes for different target enrichment
techniques, including the enrichment of speciﬁc RAD segments using
hyRAD (Suchan et al., 2016).

 

 

After the last phase, DOMINO reports the list the genomic regions (and
their coordinates) or MSA that meet the selection criteria, along with the
corresponding MSA of these regions for the selected taxa. Since
DOMINO can work with more than one MTVP set (m in a full
DOMINO run), some of the markers found in MTVP based on different
reference taxa may be redundant (they can cover the same genomic
region, although with different coordinates; see Mapping/Alignment
phase section), while other can be found only in one particular proﬁle.
To avoid reporting redundant information, we have implemented a
BLAST-based ﬁlnction to collapse these maker sequences, only report-
ing unique markers. To maximize the probability of ﬁnding informative
markers, the ﬁnal list of candidates under the DOMINO marker discov-
ery module can include overlapped regions that ﬁllﬁll the speciﬁed
characteristics. Operationally, all regions that meet the criteria for being
considered a candidate marker (after moving the scanning window ﬁve
or more base pairs) are listed as different markers in the ﬁnal output. In
this way, users can choose the best marker to be used directly for ﬁlrther
analyses or the more appropriated region of each contig to be PCR
ampliﬁed and sequenced in additional focal species (i.e., the best marker
from each linked block).

2.2 DOMINO GUI

DOMINO can be run either in the command prompt, by setting a large
set of command line options, or using the GUI speciﬁcally developed to
facilitate its use to non-experts in NGS bioinformatics tools. (Fig. 2; see
also the DOMINO manual for details). The DOMINO GUI is a cross-
platform application that allows the user to interactively set marker
selection criteria by tuning the most important parameters and options
available in the command prompt version. It should be noted that for
huge NGS data sets (which require substantial amounts of computational
resources) a full DOMINO run using the GUI version is not recommend-
able. In this case, the user can either run DOMINO under the command
line version using high performance computer clusters or, take advantage
of the custom run options available in the GUI version to enter in
DOMINO partially processed data, e.g. pre-processed reads, assemblies
or alignment ﬁles (SAM/BAM) obtained with other memory-efﬁcient
software (Supplementary Table S2).

2.3 System and Availability

The GUI was built using the cross-platform library and user interface
framework Qt (https://www.qt—proiect.org/) based on CH- scripting
language. Since most of the ﬁlnctions speciﬁcally developed for this
work are implemented in Perl scripting language, users need to install
ﬁrst a recent version of Perl (version 5.12 or higher;
http://www.perl.org/). The source code, the documentation and some
example data ﬁles are freely distributed under the GNU GPL software

3 Results and Conclusions

3.1 Computer simulations

We conducted an exhaustive computer simulation study to assess the
performance of DOMINO in detecting informative markers (i.e., simu-
lated regions that meet speciﬁc marker selection criteria) from NGS data.
For that, we emulated an RRL-like experiment of four closely related
species exhibiting different levels of nucleotide divergence among them
and incorporating substitution rate heterogeneity across sites to create
genuine informative markers. The topology of the species tree used for
the simulations was ﬁxed (Supplementary Fig. S1). In each replicate, we
generated an independent RRL-like data set of 100 fragments, of differ-
ent length (3 kb or 10 kb) each. The nucleotide sequences were simulat-
ed with the program evolver, included in the PAML v4.7 package (Yang,
1997, 2007), using 0.1, 0.15, 0.20 or 0.30 substitutions per site between
the two most divergent sequences, under the Jukes and Cantor (1969)
substitution model with substitution rate heterogeneity across sites
(modeled as a discrete gamma with 10 categories and oc=0.01). For each
replicate, we simulated a complete NGS experiment in the Roche-454
(reads with an average length of ~400 bp), and the Illumina HiSeq2000
platforms (average length of 101 bp; single and paired-ends) using the
ART v2.5.8 program (Huang et al., 2012) with default parameters and
three different sequencing coverage values (5X, 10X and 20X). We
generated 500 simulation replicates for each of the 48 possible scenarios
(i.e., for each combination RRLs fragment length, divergence, sequenc-
ing platform and coverage values), resulting in a total 27,000 DOMINO
runs, which took roughly 80,000 CPU hours.

Using the DOMINO marker discovery module under the command line
version, we ﬁrst traced the number and the location of the regions that
meet the selection criteria present in each simulated fragment previous to
emulate their NGS sequencing (true markers; TNM). Subsequently, for

each data set, we execute a full run of our program using the simulated
NGS reads to obtain the list of candidate markers (detected markers;
DNM) for each scenario. For this experiment, we deﬁne an informative
marker as a variable region of 600 bp (VL = 600), present in all four
species (MCT = 4), showing at least 0.01 nucleotide substitutions per site
between any pair of species (VD = 0.01), and ﬂanked by two highly
conserved regions of 60 or more bp long (CL = 60; only one substitution
across species was permitted; CD = 1). We assessed the performance of
DOMINO in detecting the TNM by measuring the sensitivity and preci-
sion in each replicate and plotting their distribution across the 500 repli-
cates (Fig. 3; Supplementary Information).

We found that DOMINO pipeline has a high sensitivity in detecting the
existing TNM, yielding averages of true positive rates values > 0.9 for
Illumina reads and when coverage values are equal or higher than 10X
(Fig. 3). As expected, lower coverage values (5X) result in a reduction of
the sensitivity estimates; in this case, DOMINO runs using 454 long
reads outperforms those using Illumina short reads (e. g. average sensitiv-
ities close to 0.8 for the 454 under all tested nucleotide divergences in
3kb fragments). Noticeably, we found that DOMINO show high sensitiv-
ities even for relative high divergence levels (up to 0.3 substitutions per
site between the two more diverged taxa); in this case, the program
performs slightly better when using short reads as input. In the light of
this high sensitivity, precision becomes a critical aspect to be considered
for ﬁlrther successful marker discovery. We found that DOMINO also
detects TNM regions with high precision (most values are close to 1
regardless of the condition), yielding very few number of false positives.
The performance of DOMINO when using reads from larger library
fragments (10 kb) is very similar to that of the observed for 3kb (Sup-
plementary Fig. S2).

3.2 Application to empirical data

To illustrate the utility of DOMINO on real biological data, we per-
formed a RRL sequencing experiment (using 454 reads; see Supplemen-
tary Information for details), which allow running all phases of the
application and the DOMINO marker identiﬁcation module, from raw
reads to marker selection. We used four individuals (panel with four
taxa) belonging to the spider family Nemesiz'dae (Araneae) for this
analysis (Supplementary Information, Fig. S3). We identiﬁed many
candidate regions that ﬁllﬁll the requested marker characteristics (Sup-
plementary Tables S3-S6), and tested the suitability of six of them by
PCR ampliﬁcation and Sanger sequencing in a larger panel that also
included other 14 phylogenetically related species (focal species). The
obtained phylogenetic tree not only recovered the expected relationships
among the taxa from the panel but also demonstrates that the sequenced
markers are useﬁll to establish the phylogenetic relationships of the focal
ones (Supplementary Fig. S4).

3.3 Conclusions

DOMINO will assist researches working with non-model organisms in
the development of molecular markers for DNA variation studies. First,
it allows obtaining a list of “personalized” markers that meet user specif-
ic criteria without the mandatory need of a reference genome, which will
improve their application from highly speciﬁc taxonomic scopes to more
wide phylogenetic ranges. Second, its output alignment ﬁles, jointly with
the information about markers coordinates and features provided by the
program, can be either directly utilized in variation studies, or used as a
templates for ﬁlrther downstream PCR ampliﬁcation or target DNA
enrichment probe design. Third, the DOMINO GUI makes this applica-
tion accessible and easy-to-use to non-experts in the bioinformatics of

NGS data handling and analysis. Finally, DOMINO is open cross-
platform software that can be straightforwardly adapted to other pipe-
lines or used in high performance computers. Although current version
of the program works with raw reads of a limited number of reduction
representation schemes (e. g. DOMINO cannot process raw reads from
RAD- or RNA-Seq approaches) and sequencing platforms (Illumina
short and 454 long reads), the modular structure of DOMINO will allow
easily expanding the software to accept NGS data from other sources.

Abstract

Summary: High—throughput sequencing technologies survey genetic variation at genome scale
and are increasingly used to study the contribution of rare and low—frequency genetic variants to
human traits. As part of the Cohorts arm of the UK10K project, genetic variants called from low—
read depth (average 7><) whole genome sequencing of 3621 cohort individuals were analysed for
statistical associations with 64 different phenotypic traits of biomedical importance. Here, we de—
scribe a novel genome browser based on the Biodalliance platform developed to provide inter—

active access to the association results of the project.

Availability and implementation: The browser is available at http://\MNw.uk10k.org/dalliance.html.
Source code for the Biodalliance platform is available under a BSD license from http://github.com/

1 Introduction

Rare and low—frequency genetic variants play an important role in
determining population variance of complex traits and disease; how—
ever, until recently their systematic evaluation has been beyond the
reach of empirical population—based genetic studies.

The UK10K project was designed to characterize rare and low—
frequency variation in the UK genome wide, and study its contribu—
tion to a broad spectrum of biomedically relevant quantitative traits
and diseases with different predicted genetic architectures. The data
generated by the different arms of the UK10K project and their
use are described elsewhere (UK10K Consortium, 2015). Here, we
describe the development of a novel browser for genetic association

data based on the Biodalliance platform (Down et 61]., 2011), de-
signed to facilitate the retrieval of genotype—phenotype association
results from the UK10K—cohorts arm of the project, and their visual—
ization in the conteXt of different annotation features (Fig. 1). In
particular, we developed a novel interactive display for genetic vari—
ants showing both the strength of association with a trait, and the
pattern of linkage disequilibrium (LD) within the cohort.

2 Implementation

Biodalliance is a pure JavaScript genome browser, using HTML5
canvas for displays. Biodalliance’s preferred approach for fetching
data is to use indexed binary files such as bigWig or bigBed files

Fig. 1. Example screenshot of the UK10K Genome Browser. The panel shows
a 30-kb region of the human genome where UK10K SNPs associate with HDL
Cholesterol with high P-values around the CETP gene. Colouring identifies
groups of independent SNPs

(Kent et al., 2010) which can be made available from normal web—
servers and are frequently organized as track—hubs (Raney et al.,
2014). Because Biodalliance is pure JavaScript it can be embedded in
any normal webpage making it easy to create custom browsers such
as presented here.

However, creating a display showing genetic association data
posed additional challenges. Firstly, there is no perfect file format
for representing the association results themselves (which comprise
both a P—value from the association test and additional information
about the SNP). Secondly, our desire to present LD data in a flex-
ible, interactive manner does not fit well with the usual indexed—file
approach of retrieving a single block of data corresponding to some
range of genomic coordinates.

To represent the association results, we used a pair of binary
files. Firstly, a bigWig file contains the association test result (ex—
pressed as a log P—value) for each position in the genome where a
variant was tested. A bigBed file containing the variant ID and other
information such as SNP consequence predictions supplements this.
We added support in the core Biodalliance code for merging mul-
tiple data sources into a single track. The Biodalliance renderer and
stylesheet system runs on this merged dataset, so in our association
tracks we can show association score (from a bigWig file) as the y-
axis position of the feature, but choose a point style based on the
SNP consequence (from the bigBed file). The y—axis encoding had
the added benefit of enabling a feature in the browser to search
for the next variant in the genome above an association score
threshold (exploiting information encoded in the reduced resolution
views of bigWig files) or by identifier (using a name index in the
bigBed file).

Dynamic display of LD information poses a different challenge
since all—against—all data are unwieldy but we do not know in ad—
vance which variants users might want to select as reference. One
option would be to create a Biodalliance plug—in that calculates LD
on the client side. However, this would require complete genotype
data for the cohort, which is also very large, and would raise data se—
curity concerns. Instead, we developed a simple server component
for LD calculation on the fly for a selected (or multiple) reference
variant(s), allowing the genotype data itself to remain securely
on the server. We also developed Biodalliance plug—ins for selecting
reference variants, and for communicating with the LD server.
Once again, the capability to merge results from multiple data sour—
ces proved useful, and the LD scores simply get merged into the rest
of the feature data before it is passed to the Biodalliance renderer.

Having extended the Biodalliance code in this way, bigWig and
files containing P—values were prepared for each combination of the
traits in Supplementary Appendix S1, and the statistical tests in

Supplementary Appendix S2. A description of the statistical tests im—
plemented is given in Supplementary Appendix 3. The large number
of resulting files were organized in a track—hub, which the UK10K
Genome Browser was configured to use by default. The browser
functionality is described in Supplementary Appendix 4. A reference
summary of test statistics, and key navigation functions, is given in
Supplementary Appendix 5. Finally, a step—by—step user tutorial to
the browser is also provided (Supplementary Appendix 6).

3 Results

The UK10K Genome Browser exploits the key basic features of the
Biodalliance Genome Browser. A number of custom features were
specifically designed to aid navigation and interpretation of the
UK10K—cohorts data. First, the genome browser supports dynamic es—
timation of local LD statistics (i.e. the metric 1'2) for inferring statis-
tical independence between local association signals and one or more
SNP(s) of interest. Calculations are performed in real time using the
UK10K—cohorts sequence data. Second, it allows exporting of local as—
sociation results into high—quality images (in scalable vector graphics,
svg) that can be used in publications. Finally, it provides dynamic an-
notation of each SNP, including information on minor allele fre-
quency, SNP quality metrics, as well as links to SNP annotation
resources such as dbSNP and functional genome annotation track—
hubs such as those generated by the ENCODE (Encode Project
Consortium et al., 2012), NIH Roadmap (Roadmap Epigenomics
Consortium et al., 2015) and BLUEPRINT (Adams et al., 2012).

4 Conclusions

In summary, the UK10K browser provides an intuitive and efficient
platform to access association statistics for common, low—frequency
and rare variants against a large number of human phenotypic traits.
As efforts progress to systematically map the contribution of human
genetic variation to healthy and disease phenotypes, and to integrate it
with genome functional resources, the development of platforms like
ours will become essential enabling instruments for the integration and
cross—validation of genetic discoveries within the scientific community.

ABSTRACT

Summary: In chemoinformatics and bioinformatics fields, one of the
main computational challenges in various predictive modeling is to find
a suitable way to effectively represent the molecules under investiga-
tion, such as small molecules, proteins and even complex interactions.
To solve this problem, we developed a freely available R/Bioconductor
package, called Compound—Protein Interaction with R (chi), for
complex molecular representation from drugs, proteins and more
complex interactions, including protein—protein and compound—
protein interactions. chi could calculate a large number of structural
and physicochemical features of proteins and peptides from amino
acid sequences, molecular descriptors of small molecules from their
topology and protein—protein interaction and compound—protein
interaction descriptors. In addition to main functionalities, chi could
also provide a number of useful auxiliary utilities to facilitate the user’s
need. With the descriptors calculated by this package, the users could
conveniently apply various statistical machine learning methods in R to
solve various biological and drug research questions in computational
biology and drug discovery.

Availability and implementation: chi is freely available from the
Bioconductor site (http://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/
htmI/chi.html).

1 INTRODUCTION

To develop a powerful model for prediction tasks, one of the
most important things to consider is how to effectively represent
the molecules under investigation such as small molecules, pro-
teins and even complex interactions, by a descriptor. In the ﬁeld
of chemoinformatics, molecular descriptors for small molecules
have frequently been used in quantitative structure-activity/prop-
erty relationship (QSAR/QSPR), Virtual screening, database
search, ranking, drug ADME/T prediction and other drug dis-
covery processes (Cao et al., 2011; Cherkasov et al., 2014; Gola
et al., 2006, Willett, 2014). These descriptors capture and mag-
nify distinct aspects of molecular topology to investigate how
molecular structures affect molecular properties. In the ﬁeld of
bioinformatics, sequence-derived structural and physicochemical

features have been widely used for predicting protein structural
and functional classes, protein—protein interactions, subcellular
locations and peptides of speciﬁc properties, etc (Chou et al.,
2008; Rangwala et al., 2005; Shen et al., 2007; Ye et al., 2011;
Zhang et al., 2005; Zhang et al., 2012). These features are highly
useful for representing and distinguishing proteins or peptides of
different structural, functional and interaction proﬁles. Currently,
their combinations were routinely used to characterize drug—
target interactions and predict new drug—target associations to
identify potential drug targets (Cao et al., 2013b; He et al., 2010;
Prado-Prado et al., 2011), following the spirit of chemogenomics.

Several programs for computing molecular features have been
developed, such as TOPS-MODE, Cinfony, Dragon,
CODESSA, PROFEAT, BioJava, BioPython, PseAAC, ProPy,
etc (Cao et al., 2013a, c; Cock et al., 2009; Du et al., 2012;
Holland et al., 2008; Katritzky et al., 1994; Li et al., 2006;
O’Boyle et al., 2008; Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2003; Todeschini
et al., 2010). Although a number of tools, which are either
open sources or commercial softwares, have been developed
and widely used in the two ﬁelds, their applications only focus
on the analysis of either small molecules or proteins. To the best
of our knowledge, there is currently no open-source code or tools
available for the integration and analysis of increasingly popular
interaction problems.

We developed a comprehensive molecular representation tool,
called Compound—Protein Interaction with R (chi), to empha-
size the integration of chemoinformatics and bioinformatics into
a chemogenomics platform for drug discovery. chi mainly
focuses on the study of molecular representation techniques for
not only small molecules and proteins but also interactions of
protein—protein and compound—protein. We recommend chi to
analyze and represent various complex molecular data under in-
vestigation. Further, we hope that the package will be helpful
when exploring questions concerning structures, functions and
interactions of various molecular data in the context of systems
biology.

2 PACKAGE DESCRIPTION

The chi package aims at offering a unique and comprehensive
toolkit for complex molecular representations from small mol-
ecules, proteins and more complex interactions (see Table 1). To
make the chi package fully functional, we recommend the users
to install the Enhances packages by using:

chi mainly covers the following four functionalities:

(a) For small molecules, chi could (i) calculate >300 mole-
cular descriptors, including constitutional, topological, geo-
metrical, electronic, hybrid and molecular property
descriptors; (ii) calculate 10 types of molecular ﬁngerprints,
including standard and extended Daylight ﬁngerprints,
graph ﬁngerprints based on simple connectivity, hybridiza-
tion ﬁngerprints based only on hybridization state, FP4
keys, E—state ﬁngerprints, MACCS keys, PubChem ﬁnger-
prints, KR ﬁngerprints deﬁned by Klekota and Roth, short
path ﬁngerprints, etc; (iii) realize parallelized pair-wise
similarity computation derived by ﬁngerprints and ﬁve
types of similarity measures within a list of small molecules;
(iv) realize parallelized chemical similarity search with
selected similarity metrics and maximum common substruc-
ture search between one query molecule and one molecular
database.

(b) For protein sequences, chi could (i) calculate a large
number of commonly used structural and physicochemical
descriptors, such as amino acid composition, autocorrela—
tion, composition, transition, distribution, conjoint traid,
quasi-sequence order and pseudo amino acid composition
descriptors; (ii) calculate six types of generalized scale-based

descriptors for proteochemometric (PCM) modeling, such
as generalized scale-based descriptors derived by principal
components analysis, amino acid properties, molecular
descriptors, factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, and
generalized BLOSUM/PAM matrix-derived descriptors;
(iii) calculate proﬁle-based protein features based on
position-speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM); (iV) realize paralle-
lized similarity computation derived by protein sequence
alignment and Gene Ontology (GO) semantic similarity
measures between a list of protein sequences/GO terms/
Entrez Gene IDs.

(c) For interaction data, by combining various types of
descriptors for drugs and proteins, interaction descriptors
representing protein-protein or compound-protein interac-
tions could be conveniently generated with chi, including
(i) two types of compound—protein interaction descriptors;
(ii) three types of protein—protein interaction descriptors.

((1) Several useful auxiliary utilities are included in chi: (i)
parallelized molecule and protein sequence retrieval from
several online databases, such as PubChem, ChEMBL,
KEGG, DrugBank, UniProt, RCSB PDB, etc; (ii) molecular
reading/writing in SMILES/SDF formats for small mole-
cules and F ASTA/PDB formats for proteins; (iii) molecular
format conversion between ~140 types of molecular formats
deﬁned by OpenBabel.

3 DISCUSSION

chi contains a selection of molecular descriptors to analyze,
classify and compare complex molecular network in the context
of network biology/pharmacology. They facilitate to exploit ma-
chine learning techniques to drive hypothesis from complex mo-
lecular datasets. The usefulness of these molecular descriptors
covered by chi for representing structural features of various
molecular data has been sufﬁciently demonstrated by a number
of published studies of the development of machine learning pre-
diction systems.

In the future work, we plan to apply integrated features on
various biological and drug research questions, and extend the
range of functions with new promising descriptors for the
coming versions of chi.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cancer researchers seeking immunotherapy targets in
cancer cells need tools to locate highly expressed proteins unique
to cancer cells. Missense mutation and frameshift location reporter
(MMuFLR), a Galaxy-based workflow, analyzes next-generation
sequencing paired read RNA-seq output to reliably identify small
frameshift mutations and missense mutations in highly expressed pro-
tein-coding genes. MMuFLR ignores known SNPs, low quality reads
and poly-A/T sequences. For each frameshift and missense mutation
identified, MMuFLR provides the location and sequence of the amino
acid substitutions in the novel protein candidates for direct input into
epitope evaluation tools.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) holds promise for individua-
lized targeted treatment, particularly in the realm of cancer
immunotherapy (Meinke et al., 2005). Identifying aberrant tran-
scripts from a patient’s tumor cells may provide candidate target
epitopes, which can be used to generate patient-speciﬁc vaccines.
Given the quantity of data generated by NGS, it is important to
have an efﬁcient and repeatable process to deconstruct the data
and present the most relevant vaccine targets, which includes
missense and small frameshift mutations located in protein-
coding regions of highly expressed genes. We offer missense
mutation and frameshift location reporter (MMuF LR) as a pro-
cess to analyze NGS RNA-seq paired read output to identify a
limited set of peptides that may be targets for immunotherapy.
MMuFLR is implemented as a workﬂow in Galaxy
(Blankenberg et al., 2010). Galaxy is a server-based workﬂow
system designed to run a series of applications, presented to
the user as tools, in an easy-to-use repeatable manner.
MMuFLR uses a few custom-developed Galaxy tools and
those in the standard distribution of Galaxy. In this pilot project,
MMuFLR’s ability to identify potential vaccine targets was
tested in RNA-seq datasets derived from two benign human

meningiomas. However, the use of MMuFLR is not limited to
cancer immunotherapy. It can also be used to locate prominent
mutations responsible for cancer development and for other
maladies, such as genetic diseases, developmental defects and
drug resistance.

2 WORKFLOW

2.1 Map read sequences to reference genome

MMuF LR starts with the NGS RNA-seq paired read output in
the form of two fastq—formatted ﬁles. Each read pair is individu-
ally mapped to the reference genome using TopHat (Langmead
et al., 2009), resulting in a bam formatted ﬁle. The standard
Galaxy distribution includes TopHat in its toolset. The custom
Galaxy tool ‘Filter SAM or BAM’ invokes the SAMtools (Li
et al., 2009) view command to ﬁlter TopHat bam output by the
MAPQ score.

2.2 Reﬁne the mapping

TopHat, as is typical with short read mappers, may ﬁnd multiple
mappings for individual read pairs, which are equally valid. The
mapped reads can be analyzed in aggregate to improve upon the
initial mapping of individual reads. The MMuF LR workﬂow
uses software from the genome analysis toolkit (GATK)
(DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010) along with
Picard-tools (http://picard.sourceforge.net) to perform this col-
lective analysis and realign the individual reads. GATK requires
bam input to be labeled with read group information and be
sorted in reference order. Several Picard-tools (‘Add or
Replace Groups’, ‘Paired Read Mate Fixer’, ‘Mark Duplicate
Reads’ and ‘Reorder SAM/BAM’) add the read groups, ﬁlter
out unmapped pairs, remove exact duplicate reads and sort the
resulting bam output into reference order. Two GATK tools,
‘Realigner Target Creator’ and ‘Indel Realigner’, realign the
reads based on aggregate information from all reads. Duplicate
reads are again identiﬁed and removed with ‘Mark Duplicate
Reads’.

2.3 Multiple alignment

The realigned reads are then assembled into a multiple alignment
using the Galaxy tool ‘MPileup’, which invokes SAMtools
MPileup. The custom Galaxy tool, ‘Pileup to VCF’, ﬁlters the
pileup results and converts them to the standard variant call
format (VCF). Filter parameters to the ‘Pileup to VCF’ tool

include minimum base quality, minimum coverage depth and
minimum frequency of a speciﬁc allele.

2.4 Eliminate common variants

The resulting VCF ﬁle will likely contain many commonly
known variants, which would not be useful in determining can-
didate targets. MMuF LR uses the ‘annotate’ command of
SnpSift (Cingolani et al., 2012) to merge variants from the sam-
ples being evaluated with known variants from the dbSNP data-
base (Sherry et al., 2001), as well as a user-provided list. Then the
‘ﬁlter’ command of SnpSift is used to eliminate those annotated
variant entries.

2.5 Determine variant effects

MMuF LR next categorizes the effect of each variant using
Sanff (Cingolani et al., 2012). The ‘ﬁlter’ command of
SnpSift is used to separate the missense and frameshift variants
into individual ﬁles for reporting.

2.6 Report variants

Finally, a new Galaxy tool, ‘Sanff Ensembl CDS’, inserts the
variants into transcripts retrieved from Ensembl (Flicek et al.,
2013) and reports the amino acid sequence of the abnormal pep-
tides. Included in the report are the sequencing depth of reads at
the mutation site and the prevalence of the mutation. A param-
eter can be set to ignore poly-A/T sequences of speciﬁed lengths.

3 RESULTS

MMuF LR was executed for two human meningioma RNA-seq
datasets, MG1 and MG2. MMuF LR settings restricted the selec-
tion of candidate genes with minimum coverage of ﬁve reads, with
a prevalence >0.32 and a Phred quality score of 20 or more.
MMuF LR also ignored poly A/T mononucleotide sequences of
35. MMuFLR identiﬁed 16 frameshifts and 576 missense muta-
tions in the MG1 sample, and 10 frameshifts and 509 missense
mutations in the MG2 sample. The candidates were evaluated for
their presence in other samples. Sanger sequencing of nine prom-
inent candidates, not found in other cancer samples, veriﬁed the
existence of the mutations within the tumor samples, with the
MMuF LR prevalence accurately reﬂecting the relative abundance
of the mutation within the total transcripts present (Table 1).
Because there were no normal samples available for comparison,
these mutations may represent rare germline variants.

4 CONCLUSIONS

One challenge for developing patient-speciﬁc cancer vaccines is
identifying novel peptides speciﬁc to the tumor cells. MMuF LR
is an innovative Galaxy-based software tool designed to locate
highly abundant transcripts with frameshift or missense muta-
tions within protein-coding sequences. MMuF LR ignores poten-
tially false candidates such as frameshifts located within poly
A/T sequences of mononucleotides, which is believed to result
from a loss of ﬁdelity during replication due to dissociation
within the reverse transcriptase binding site in a phenomenon
referred to as ‘stuttering’. Because there is always a lag between

the identiﬁcation of SNPs and their incorporation into the
dbSNP database, MMuF LR provides the ability to establish a
supplementary SNP table in which the researcher can record and
thereby ignore SNPs identiﬁed during their research efforts.
MMuFLR has been successfully tested with both human and
mouse samples, but should be easily adaptable to other
organisms.

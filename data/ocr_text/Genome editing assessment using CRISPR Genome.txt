ABSTRACT

Summary: Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats
(CRISPR)—based technologies have revolutionized human genome en-
gineering and opened countless possibilities to basic science, syn-
thetic biology and gene therapy. Albeit the enormous potential of
these tools, their performance is far from perfect. It is essential to
perform a posterior careful analysis of the gene editing experiment.
However, there are no computational tools for genome editing assess-
ment yet, and current experimental tools lack sensitivity and flexibility.
We present a platform to assess the quality of a genome editing ex-
periment only with three mouse clicks. The method evaluates next-
generation data to quantify and characterize insertions, deletions and
homologous recombination. CRISPR Genome Analyzer provides a
report for the locus selected, which includes a quantiﬁcation of the
edited site and the analysis of the different alterations detected. The
platform maps the reads, estimates and locates insertions and dele-
tions, computes the allele replacement efficiency and provides a
report integrating all the information.

1 INTRODUCTION

The journal Science selected CRISPR (clustered regularly inter-
spaced short palindromic repeats) as one of the top 10 break-
throughs of 2013 (Clear, 2013). CRISPR-based technologies
(Cho et al., 2013; Cong et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2013; Mali
et al., 2013) have revolutionized human genome engineering
and opened unlimited possibilities to basic science, synthetic biol-
ogy and gene therapy. Its design simplicity and efﬁciency makes
it an extremely versatile tool (Jinek et al., 2012).

Most of the genome engineering methods are based on the
combined effort of a nuclease, and an exogenous DNA, which
encodes the desired edits. The nuclease speciﬁcally cleaves the
genome in a region close to the targeting site, and the cellular
machinery repairs the genome using the exogenous DNA as tem-
plate. CRISPR gene editing is based on Cas9. This protein can be
programmed easily to cleave speciﬁc DNA sequences and target
21 la carte the desired genome region (Jinek et al., 2012).

Although these technologies have been widely implemented in
many ﬁelds and organisms [human, cynomolgus monkeys,
mouse, rat, zebraﬁsh, drosophila, yeast, Caenorhabditis elegans,
Arabidopsis, bacteria and others (DiCarlo et al., 2013; Esvelt
et al., 2013; Feng et al., 2013; Hwang et al., 2013; Li et al.,
2013; Niu et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2013)], we do not have any
computational tools to analyze the outcome of these experiments
yet. Several tools have proliferated for off-target prediction
(http://bioanalysis.otago.ac.nz/CRISPRTarget) and experiment
design (http://www.e-crisp.org, http://ziﬁt.partners.org/ZiFiT/,
http://www.crispr-cas.org/, http: //wormcas9hr.weebly.com/),
but none of them supports experimental analysis.

We present CRISPR Genome Analyzer (CRISPR-GA), a
platform to assess the quality of a genome editing experiment
only with three mouse clicks. It can be used in any genomic locus
of any organism that the sequence is available. The method uses
next-generation data to quantify and characterize insertions, de-
letions and homologous recombination (HR) at the intended
targeting sites. Current methods to assess genome engineering
are based on enzymatic mutation detection techniques (Kim
et al., 2009; Qiu et al., 2004) or reporter assays. Both methods
suffer from important limitations. In optimal conditions, an en-
zymatic method such as Surveyor’s assay, it reaches a detection
limit of 3%, but often editing efﬁciencies are well below this
value Wang et al., 2013) (Fig. 1C). Another enzymatic
method, the T7 endonuclease I (T7E) may achieve detection
limits around 1%. Both methods have biases on the detection
limit. Surveyor’s assay is more sensitive to transition and trans-
version mutations, whereas T7E to indels (Huang et al., 2012).
Reporter assays are more sensitive, as they detect single cells, but
they require additional steps to generate exogenous DNA re-
porter constructs. More importantly, reporters incorporate
other by-products (i.e. ﬂuorescent proteins), which may not be
desired for certain applications. In addition, both methods de-
liver a binary output, and none provides with a complete descrip-
tion of the genome editing experiment.

CRISPR-GA requires little experimental labor, and it provides
a complete report of the genome editing results with a fast turn-
over. The user is only required to use polymerase chain reaction
(PCR) to amplify the area of the genome to analyze (the speciﬁc
instructions to carry out this PCR can be found in
supplementary). This ampliﬁed library is sequenced with an
Illumina Miseq Machine (other platforms may also be used;
see online documentation). The user provides to the pipeline
CRISPR-GA, the next-generation sequencing obtained reads,
the intended editing sequence and the original sequence.

Fig. 1. CRISPR-GA pipeline. (A) From experiment to report. Schematic
pipeline of gene editing assessment. (B) Output of CRISPR-GA: different
information is estimated. Deletions, insertions, HR and corresponding
efﬁciencies. Upper panels estimate the number of insertions and deletions
and each corresponding size. Middle panels estimate the number of in-
sertions and deletions, and their corresponding location within the gen-
omic locus of interest. The bottom panel shows the number of deletions
and HR at each corresponding locations and outputs the HR and NHEJ
efﬁciency. (C) Experimental results assessed by CRISPR-GA from testing
several mutants of cas9, gRNAs and a DNA template. HR and NHEJ
values are presented

CRISPR-GA will estimate the HR (normally associated with
intended edits), non-homologous end-joining (NHEJ; normally
associated with non-desired edits) and a complete report of the
location and characteristics of the indels.

Next-generation sequencing is becoming available for most
research institutions. The possibility of bar coding hundreds of
samples in a single Illumina Miseq lane makes it competitive
from a time and economic perspective. Hundred samples can
be analyzed for a bit more than $1000 with cost of $10 per
sample, in one overnight Illumina Miseq Run.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

CRISPR-GA pipeline consists of ﬁve different steps: reads qual-
ity control, mapping, indel calling, HR and NHEJ estimation
and graphical representation (Fig. 1A). Initially, the reads are
uploaded, the 3’ end is trimmed of nucleotides with a Phred
score <20 and reads shorter than 80 bp are discarded [fastx tool-
kit, (Pearson et al., 1997)]. This ﬁltering and trimming step elim-
inates reads with sequencing errors. Then, they are mapped to
the user-incorporated reference sequence using BLAT [(Kent,
2002)], which has a good support for indels. If the user inputs
paired-end reads, the ﬁrst two steps will be done independently,
and the results intersected. Most of the users will supply paired-
end reads, as all new Illumina kits only support paired ends.
However, CRISPR-GA single end compatibility will be main-
tained to support all possible experimental setups. In the third
step, R statistical language (http://www.R-project.org/) is used to

process the mapped BLAT results and call the insertions and
deletions. Fourth, pattern matching is used to compute the
number of reads matching the expected sequence and other vari-
ants generated. NHEJ and HR are estimated computing the
Equations (1) and (2), respectively. Fifth, R statistical language
is used to produce a report that integrates the results (Fig. 1B). It
consists of three parts: (i) analysis of indels sizes, (ii) analysis of
indels locations within the edited genomic locus and (iii) an inte-
grated plot representing indels, NHEJ and HR. Additionally, a
FASTA ﬁle is generated with all reads containing indels, as well
as an XML text output with HR, NHEJ values and indels rela-
tive location in genomic locus.

NHEJ= 100 X (non — expected altered reads) / (total reads) (1)

HR = 100 X (expected sequence reads) / (total reads) (2)

We provide an example of the potential of CRISPR-GA
(Fig. 1C). We made an experiment where we analyze the efﬁ-
ciency of different variants of cas9 (nuclease and nickases), and
different guide RNAs (gRNAs) (AS2 + S3) targeting two adja-
cent sites on the AAVSl locus Wang et al., 2013). We have also
used a single-stranded oligonucleotide DNA template to intro-
duce speciﬁc mutations via HR. CRISPR-GA is sensitive to
detect the differences of editing efﬁciency with the Human
Induced Pluripotent Stem Cells (hiPSC). We see that nickase
NHEJ activity is signiﬁcantly lower than that of nuclease.
However, HR efﬁciency shows similar results. These are expected
results, as the nickase only excises one genomic strand, whereas
the nuclease both, stimulating NHEJ pathway.

3 CONCLUSIONS

CRISPR-GA is a tool that provides easy (three mouse clicks),
economic (~$10), sensitive (detection limit <0.1%) and compre-
hensive analysis of gene editing results.

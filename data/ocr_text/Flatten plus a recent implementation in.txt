Abstract

Summary: Scanning probe microscopy (SPM) is already a relevant tool in biological research at
the nanoscale. We present ’Flatten plus’, a recent and helpful implementation in the well—known
WSXM free software package. ’Flatten plus’ allows reducing low—frequency noise in SPM images in
a semi—automated way preventing the appearance of typical artifacts associated with such filters.

Availability and implementation: WSXM is a free software implemented in C++ supported on MS
Windows, but it can also be run under Mac or Linux using emulators such as Wine or Parallels.

WSXM can be downloaded from http://vwmvwsxmsolutions.com/.

1 Introduction

Since the introduction of scanning tunneling microscopy (STM) by
Binnig et al. (1982) and later atomic force microscopy (AFM)
(Binnig et 61]., 1986), Scanning Probe Microscopy (SPM), the general
denomination for these techniques, has become a very relevant tool
for the life sciences research. SPM can be used to obtain atomically
resolved images in different media including ultrahigh vacuum, am—
bient air and liquids. SPM allows the possibility to study biological
systems (Baro et 61]., 1985; Gould et 61]., 1988) even in their native
environment (Hansma et 61]., 1992) with unprecedented results.
SPM is best known for its ability to acquire images; but in reality
SPM also allows many other features, as for instance manipulation
of matter at the atomic/nanometer scale (Eigler and Schweizer,
1990), spectroscopy measurement of tip—sample interactions
(Burnham et 61]., 1993) or the characterization of mechanical proper—
ties of relevant biological entities including proteins (Rief et 61].,
1997), cells (Radmacher et 61]., 1996) and virus particles (Ivanovska
et al., 2004).

SPM images are acquired by scanning a very sharp tip on a re—
gion of interest. The distance between the tip and the sample surface

is in the nanometer range. As in many other techniques there are a
number of artifacts that are commonly present even in the best
acquired images: noise due to different sources (mechanical, elec—
trical, environmental, etc.), visible slopes in the main plane of an
image or tip—sample dilations (Villarrubia, 1997). Thus, the devel—
opment and improvement of the available processing tools becomes
of great importance to ease the visualization and interpretation of
SPM images.

Biological samples studied by SPM typically consist of the biolo—
gical specimens immobilized to an atomically ﬂat, texture—free sur—
face (Wagner, 1998). The way an SPM is operated can make
variations from scan line—to—scan line difficult to be avoided
(changes in the average height, tilts or low—frequency noise) (Fogarty
et 61]., 2006; Schouterden et 61]., 1996). Thus, processing filters such
as plane and ﬂatten filters are very common when analyzing SPM
images. Plane filters fit the raw data image to a general plane or
parabolic surface, which is then subtracted from the original image.
However, some issues in SPM images such as vertical scanner drift,
scanner non—linearities, areas with different slopes or very different
heights, etc., cannot be adequately corrected by plane filters. Flatten

works by subtracting a function from each scan line in the raw data
image. The simplest function is a zero—order function: the average of
each line. Other common possibilities are a first—order function
(a straight line) or a second—order function (a parabola). Flatten
filters can be used to eliminate slopes, bows and/or bands in the
images coming from low—frequency noise.

A raw data image presents different features, and therefore, dif—
ferent heights. If a line is basically ﬂat, and its average is subtracted,
the whole line will change the same way, therefore, it will remain
uniform (for example, area within the gray rectangle in Fig. 1b).
When a line contains very different heights and the average is sub—
tracted, the originally lower parts will be even lower. This causes
‘artificial’ negative contrast regions (shadowing effects) around the
higher parts of the filtered image (area within the black rectangle in
Fig. 1b). There are some standard tools to avoid these effects: dis—
card regions, draw master paths, etc. However, these processes can
be tedious for images with a large number of features or are hard to
put to practical use. There are a good number of high—impact journal
publications where, without discussing here the quality of the results
there presented, some of the published images show these shadow—
ing effects. Some very recent examples can be found in the following
references (Endo et al., 2014; Fisicaro et al., 2014; Jaksa et al.,
2014; Kim et al., 2014; Marchi et al., 2014; Miles and Frankel
2014; Moon et al., 2014; Uprety et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014;
Yamamoto et al., 2014).

WSxM is a free software devoted to the control of SPM systems
and processing of images and data acquired with such microscopes.
It was initially created at the New Microscopies Lab, in the
Universidad Autonoma de Madrid (UAM). Then it continued grow—
ing at Nanotec Electronica SL, and now it is maintained and de—
veloped by WSxM solutions (www.wsxmsolutions.com). A detailed
view of WSxM can be found in Horcas et al. (2007). Here, we ex—
plain in some detail the features of ‘Flatten plus’, an option recently
developed in WSxM that is particularly beneficial for biological
data, enabling in a semi—automated way to remove typical artifacts
when applying common filters to process SPM images.

2 Implementation

Consider the unfiltered image shown in Figure 1b (left). Just by
visual inspection one can easily find the general background. As
usual, this simple task is very difficult to identify by a computer.
Conventional flatten algorithms consider the lower points of an
image as the flat substrate. ‘Flatten plus’ uses successive approxi—
mation algorithms using the information provided by the user
through the Substrate area (%) parameter. This information can
be just an ocular estimation of the percentage of background area
as a share of total image area or can include regions to discard.
Successive approximation algorithms discard the highest points in
the image and apply a flatten process. This is similar to the method
of discarding regions defined by the user but in this case the re—
gions are automatically defined and they are free in shape and in
number. Each iteration discards additional points over the results
of the previous step and the remaining points are considered as the
ﬂat substrate. This iterative process is repeated until the Substrate
area value is reached. Figure 1a presents a ﬂow chart of the various
steps of the ‘Flatten plus’ routine. Figure 1b and c shows an ex—
ample of the difference between usual flatten filters (Fig. 1b right)
and ‘Flatten plus’ (Fig. 1c right) when applied to a typical DNA
image. Whereas filtered image in Figure 1b presents shadowing ef—
fects around the higher parts, they are not present in Figure 1c.

Figure 1d shows height profiles after usual ﬂatten (dashed blue
line in Fig. 1b) and ‘Flatten plus’ (solid green line in Fig. 1c). The
background of both images shows the same roughness, but in the
center part of the usual flatten profile it can be clearly distin-
guished a depression coming from an ‘artificial’ dark region in
Figure 1b. Since mica is atomically smooth over relatively large
(often micrometer sized) areas, these dark regions correspond to
artifacts.

3 Conclusion

We have introduced a relevant implementation in software tech—
niques for SPM. ‘Flatten plus’ provides a semi—automated filter to
eliminate low—frequency noise reflected as slopes, bows and/or
bands in images preventing the appearance of undesired shadowing
effects which is common in conventional ﬂatten procedures.

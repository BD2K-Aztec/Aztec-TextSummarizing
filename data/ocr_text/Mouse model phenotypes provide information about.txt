ABSTRACT

Motivation: Methods for computational drug target identification use
information from diverse information sources to predict or prioritize
drug targets for known drugs. One set of resources that has been
relatively neglected for drug repurposing is animal model phenotype.
Results: We investigate the use of mouse model phenotypes for drug
target identification. To achieve this goal, we first integrate mouse
model phenotypes and drug effects, and then systematically compare
the phenotypic similarity between mouse models and drug effect
profiles. We find a high similarity between phenotypes resulting from
loss-of-function mutations and drug effects resulting from the inhib-
ition of a protein through a drug action, and demonstrate how this
approach can be used to suggest candidate drug targets.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge currently faced by pharmacological research is
the high rate of attrition in the development of new compounds,
the increased cost of drug development and increased regulatory
concern about drug safety and efficacy (Sleigh and Barton,
2010). As a result, pharmacological research is beginning to
focus on repurposing existing drugs for new indications, and sev-
eral large national and international research initiatives have
begun to systematically address drug repurposing on a broad
scale (Allison, 2012).

Strategies for drug repurposing can be divided into two main
types: identiﬁcation of new targets for known drugs and identi-
ﬁcation of new indications for a known mechanism of action
(Sleigh and Barton, 2010). Approaches to drug repurposing
include database-driven bioinformatics approaches, in vivo and
ex vivo studies and high-throughput screening methods (Sleigh

and Barton, 2010). Examples of computational approaches to
drug repurposing include side effect-based approaches, in
which similarity between drug effects is used to suggest drug
targets and drug indications (Campillos et al., 2008), data
mining of clinical records (Tatonetti et al., 2012) and approaches
based on analysis of GWAS data (Sanseau et al., 2012).
Computational approaches to drug repurposing have the highest
chance of succeeding if multiple independent data sources and
analysis approaches are combined so that data from several
independent domains and studies can be used to identify
strong evidence for novel drug indications. Based on integrating
multiple complementary datasets, integrative computational
approaches can use multiple measures to prioritize candidate
targets and drugs (Chen et al., 2012b; Gottlieb et al., 2011;
Thorn et al., 2010).

One set of resources that has been relatively neglected for drug
repurposing is animal model phenotype (Hoehndorf et al., 2012;
Hurle et al., 2013). The use of non-human species to investigate
physiology and pathobiology, and the creation of animal models
of human diseases amenable to experimental investigation, has
become a successful paradigm in the biomedical sciences
(Rosenthal and Brown, 2007). The development of high-
throughput phenotyping has further increased the available
amount of phenotype data resulting from targeted mutations
in animal models, and pan-genomic projects such as the
International Mouse Phenotyping Consortium (IMPC) (Brown
and Moore, 2012) aim to delete every protein-coding gene in an
organism and to identify the phenotypes resulting from these
mutations. It has now become a challenge to systematically ana-
lyze the resulting data and use them to provide insights into
human health and novel intervention strategies.

In the past, several studies have used animal model data to
suggest candidate genes for genetically based diseases (Chen
et al., 2012a; Hoehndorf et al., 2011b), and one study also sug-
gests that mouse model phenotypes can be used to provide
insights into drug actions and drug effects in humans despite
experimental differences between the two species (Kuhn et al.,
2013). Here, we use a phenome—wide approach to systematically
compare drug effects with mutant mouse phenotypes (Fig. 1).
We provide strong supporting evidence for the hypothesis that
the similarity between drug effects and mouse phenotypes that
result from loss of protein function indicates a similarity in the

Fig. 1. The ﬁgure illustrates our basic workﬁow and the connections
between the different datasets we exploit. We aim to infer inhibition ac-
tions between drugs and their targets based on the similarity between
drug effect proﬁles and mouse model phenotypes resulting from single
gene knockouts. We test the hypothesis whether the phenotypic effects of
a perturbation of a gene/protein through a drug action bears some simi-
larity to the phenotypic effects of a targeted mutation of that gene/protein
observed in a model organism. As drugs often perturb multiple genes/
proteins, we systematically compute how well a drug effect proﬁle covers
observed phenotypes in a mouse model using a non-symmetrical measure
of semantic similarity

mechanism of action, i.e. an inhibition of the protein through the
drug. We evaluate our results with experimentally validated lists
of known drug targets and demonstrate on a genomic scale that a
similarity between drug effects and mutant mouse phenotypes
can reveal drug targets. Our approach opens the possibility for
a systematic analysis of animal model phenotypes for candidate
drug targets, and has a signiﬁcant impact for integrative compu-
tational approaches to drug repurposing.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Mouse model phenotypes

We use the Mammalian Phenotype (MP) Ontology (Smith et al., 2004)
and the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) (Robinson et al., 2008), both
downloaded on February 14, 2013 from the OBO Foundry Web site
(http://obofoundry.org). We obtain the entity-quality deﬁnitions attached
to MP and HPO from https://phenotype—ontologies.googlecode.com
(downloaded on February 14, 2013).

We downloaded mouse phenotype data from the Mouse Genome
Informatics (MGI) database (Blake et al., 2011) on February 14, 2013.
We obtained only mouse model phenotypes associated with models
resulting from loss-of—function mutations in single genes.

2.2 Drug effect proﬁles and drug targets

Drug effect proﬁles were obtained from SIDER 2 (released on March 16,
2012) (Kuhn et al., 2010). For each drug, we identify the STITCH iden-
tiﬁer associated with the drug. We ignore all drugs for which no STITCH
identiﬁer has been identiﬁed in the SIDER dataset. STITCH identiﬁers
are based on the STITCH database, version 3.1 (Kuhn et al., 2012).

2.3 Integrating drug effects and phenotypes

We used a combination of lexical mapping, manual curation and exploit-
ation of cross-references to map the Uniﬁed Medical Language System
(UMLS) terms used to characterize SIDER’s drug proﬁles to the Human
and Mammalian Phenotype Ontologies. Using exact lexical matching of
UMLS terms to term names and synonyms in ontologies, we mapped 597
terms from SIDER to the HPO (Robinson et al., 2008) and 262 terms
from SIDER to the MP Ontology (Smith et al., 2004). HPO already
contains cross-references to terms from the UMLS (Bodenreider, 2004),
3858 of which can be found in SIDER’s drug effect proﬁles. We sorted

the remaining SIDER terms for which we could not obtain a mapping to
HPO or MP based on the frequency of their occurrence in SIDER drug
effect proﬁles and manually mapped 953 of the most frequently occurring
terms to HPO and 240 of the most frequently occurring terms to MP. The
mappings are available on the project Web site.

2.4 Cross-species integration of phenotypes

Although we have annotated SIDER with both MP and HPO terms,
mouse phenotypes are represented exclusively using MP. To make
HPO and MP phenotype terms comparable, we use the PhenomeNET
system of integrating phenotypes across species (Hoehndorf et al., 2011b,
2013). PhenomeNET enables the direct comparison of phenotypes across
multiple species (Hoehndorf et al., 2011b, 2013), including mouse model
phenotypes (describing using the MP) and human drug effects (described
using the UMLS and mapped to HPO using our approach).

PhenomeNET uses an ontology-based integration framework that in-
tegrates phenotypes in different species based on species-independent
ontologies and the PATO framework (Gkoutos et al., 2005). In particu-
lar, PhenomeNET uses the large number of entity-quality-based deﬁn-
itions that have been created for species-speciﬁc phenotype ontology
(Mungall et al., 2010) and integrates them with species-independent
ontologies. Entity-quality deﬁnitions of phenotypes decompose pheno-
type terms in an affected entity and a quality that characterizes how the
entity is affected. For example, the phenotype term proximal fibular over-
growth (HP: 000712 6) is decomposed into the entity proximal epiphysis
of fibula (FMA: 33729) and the quality hypertrophic (PATO : 0000584).
Similarly, the mouse phenotype term abnormal ﬁbula morphology
(MP: 0002187) is decomposed into the entity ﬁbula (MA: 00013 60)
and the quality morphology (PATO : 0000051) with the qualiﬁer abnor-
mal (PATO: 0000460).

Phenotypes in which biological processes, functions or cellular compo-
nents are affected can then be integrated across species based on the Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashbumer et al., 2000), and phenotypes in which
anatomical structures are affected are integrated based on homologous
anatomical structures represented in the UBERON ontology (Mungall
et al., 2012). Using automated reasoning (Kazakov et al., 2011), it then
becomes possible to systematically identify equivalent, more speciﬁc and
more general phenotypes across multiple species. For example, based on
axioms in the combined ontology, we can infer that proximal fibular
overgrowth is a more speciﬁc phenotype term than abnormal fibula morph-
ology using the information that

o Fibula (MA: 0 0 0 1 3 6 0) is homologous to fibula (FMA : 2 44 7 9) (from
the UBERON ontology),

o Proximal epiphysis of fibula (FMA: 33729) is a part-of fibula
(FMA:24479) (from the FMA) and

o H ypertrophic (PATO : O O O O 5 8 4) is a more speciﬁc quality than
morphology (abnormal) (PATO: 0 0 0 0 4 6 0).

Additional details for integrating phenotype ontologies across species
using the Web Ontology Language (Grau et al., 2008) are discussed in
prior work (Hoehndorf et al., 2010; 2011a, b).

2.5 Semantic similarity

Traditional semantic similarity measures are symmetrical, i.e. the similar-
ity between X and Y is the same as the similarity between Y and X. As
drugs may bind to multiple targets to elicit their effects (Kuhn et al.,
2013), we designed a novel non-symmetrical similarity measure based
on the well-known SimGIC measure (Pesquita et al., 2009). SimGIC is
a group-based measure of semantic similarity, i.e. it compares two sets of
annotations directly and is based on the J accard index weighted by the
information content of ontology terms (Pesquita et al., 2009).

PhenoDrug

 

We ﬁrst select all phenotypes observed for single gene deletions in
mice. For each gene G for which phenotype data are present in the
MGI database, we then generate the union of the phenotypes observed
in all models in which G has been deleted. The resulting phenotypes for a
gene G are all phenotypes observed in mouse models in which G (and
only G) has been deleted and provides a global view on the phenotypes
associated with deletions of G.

We then add the super-classes of the phenotype annotations of each
mouse model and drug to their set of annotations. In particular, if the
HPO or MP phenotype P is a phenotype annotation associated with gene
or drug X, and the super-classes of X in MP are the classes Sup(X), we
add Sup(X) as annotations to X. To compute super-classes, we use the
combined ontology of MP and HPO that forms part of PhenomeNET
and enables cross-species comparisons of phenotypes (i.e. a class in MP
may be a super-class of a class in HPO and vice versa) (Hoehndorf et al.,
2011b). We make the MP-based representation of drug effects in SIDER
based on which we compute the similarity available on the project
Web site.

We then deﬁne the information content IC(t) of an MP phenotype
term t based on the probability P(X = t) that a drug or mutant mouse
model is characterized with t:

IC(t) = — log(P(X = 2)) (1)

The probability P(X = t) is empirically derived within the corpus of
mouse models and drug proﬁles. We use only the structure of the MP
to compute semantic similarity based on prior work that has shown that
MP-based similarity measures outperform measures that use HPO or the
combination of HPO and MP for analyzing mouse phenotype data
(Oellrich et al., 2012).

Given a drug effect proﬁle D and a mutant mouse model M, where D
is characterized by the ontology classes Cl(D) 2 D1, ...,Dn and M
is characterized by the classes Cl(M) = M1, ..., Mm, we deﬁne the
similarity between D and M as:

IC(x)
xe Cl(D)r‘lCl(M)

Z IC(y)

ye Cl(D)

sim(D, M) = (2)

As a result, we obtain a similarity matrix between drug effect proﬁles and
mouse model phenotypes (resulting from deletions of one gene). The
similarity measure used is non-symmetrical and determines the amount
of information about a drug effect proﬁle D that is covered by a set of
mouse model phenotypes M.

2.6 Evaluation datasets

Our approach is based on identifying a similarity between drug effect
proﬁles and mouse model phenotypes. The STITCH database provides
us with a set of drug—protein interactions in the mouse. We ﬁlter these
interactions for those in which the mode of action is ‘inhibition’ (in the
STITCH ﬁle actions.v3 .1.tsv) and use this dataset directly as
evaluation dataset ‘STITCH (mouse)’.

As we primarily aim to predict drug targets in human, we use the
human—mouse orthology provided by the MGI database (Blake et al.,
2011) to obtain the mouse ortholog for each human gene that is a target
of a STITCH compound, and use the mouse ortholo g of the human drug
target as a positive hit for the STITCH compound. We use the human
drug—protein interactions provided by STITCH in which the mode of
action is ‘inhibition’ as evaluation dataset ‘STITCH (human)’, and the
human drug targets provided by DrugBank in which the mode of action
is ‘inhibition’ as evaluation dataset ‘DrugBank’.

The STITCH database accumulates data from multiple sources and
contains a conﬁdence value for each interaction. The conﬁdence ranges
between 0 and 1, with an implicit cutoff value of 0.15. To evaluate the
results of our analysis under different degrees of conﬁdence, we generated
evaluation datasets for STITCH in which we require a conﬁdence of

at least 0.5, and another dataset in which we require a conﬁdence of
at least 0.7. The evaluation datasets we used are available on the project
Web site.

2.7 Receiver operating characteristic analysis and
approximation of conﬁdence intervals

To compute true— and false-positive rate, we iterate through the ranks of
the generated similarity matrix (between drugs and mouse models) and
compute, for each rank, the proportion of known drug targets in each of
our evaluation datasets identiﬁed up to this rank (true-positive rate) as
well as the proportion of targets not in the evaluation dataset included up
to this rank (false-positive rate). We then use an analysis of the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve to evaluate and quantify the results.
An ROC curve is a plot of the true-positive rate as a function of the false-
positive rate and can be used to evaluate the performance of a classiﬁer
(Fawcett, 2006).

Conﬁdence intervals for the area under the ROC curve (ROCAUC)
are computed under the assumption of a normal distribution of

ROCAUC values and using an estimate of the maximum variance of
AUC l—AU - -

the ROCAUC as aim = W, w1th m and n belng the number

of positive and negative instances in the evaluation dataset (Birnbaum

and Klose, 1957). We then use AUC :l: 20 as an estimate of the 95%

conﬁdence interval (Cortes and Mohri, 2005).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Mouse model phenotypes provide information about
drug targets

The hypothesis we test is whether a similarity between drug
D’s effects and phenotypes resulting from knock-out/knock—
down of a single gene (product) in an animal model can be
used to indicate that D inhibits the gene (product) or its human
ortholog, and whether phenotype similarity between mouse
models and drug effects can be used to provide insights relevant
for discovery of targets for known drugs. To test these hypoth-
eses, we ﬁrst made drug effects and mouse phenotypes compar-
able by mapping the drug effects described in the SIDER
database (Kuhn et al., 2010) with human and mouse phenotype
terms, and then integrating human and mouse phenotypes across
species (see Section 2).

Once mouse model phenotypes and human drug effects
are made directly comparable, we use a measure of semantic
similarity (Pesquita et al., 2008) to compare drug effect proﬁles
with mutant mouse phenotypes. We systematically compare
the sets of phenotypes that have been observed in mice with
single gene deletions with drug effect proﬁles obtained from
the SIDER database, and use their similarity to prioritize candi-
date drug—protein interactions. To account for drugs’ binding
to multiple targets, we developed a novel similarity measure
between drug effect proﬁles and mouse model phenotypes that
determines how much of the information in the drug effect pro-
ﬁle can be explained through a set of mouse model phenotypes
(Section 2). A schematic overview of the approach is shown in
Figure 1.

We evaluate the results using three datasets: the human drug
targets available in DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011), the human
drug targets available in the STITCH database (Kuhn et al.,
2012) and the mouse drug targets available in the STITCH data-
base. DrugBank contains experimentally validated drug targets

and includes information on the mode of action. Similarly,
STITCH accumulates information about human and animal
drug targets from multiple sources and includes the mode of
action, if known. For our evaluation, we select only drug targets
for which the mechanism of action is inhibition, as we aim to test
whether these provide a similar phenotypic response as a knock-
out/knock-down of the target.

For each drug, we identify the similarity between its pharma-
cological effects and the phenotypes observed in mouse models
with a single gene deletion and rank the mouse models, for
each drug, based on their similarity to the drug effect proﬁle.
We then evaluate the resulting ranks using positive instances of
drug-target interactions, and Figure 2 shows the resulting ROC
curves for the three main datasets we used. The ROCAUC values
are 0.739 :l: 0.011 for mouse targets (STITCH), 0.709 :l: 0.009 for
human targets (STITCH) and 0.723 :l: 0.040 for human targets

consists of experimentally veriﬁed and manually annotated drug-target
interactions. STITCH integrates drug-target relations from multiple data-
bases (including DrugBank), applies text mining and network-based in-
ference approaches to infer drug-target relations. We used human—mouse
orthology available from the MGI database to map human proteins in
the DrugBank and STITCH (human) dataset to mouse proteins

(DrugBank). We further restricted the STITCH evaluation
datasets for human and mouse to high-conﬁdence drug—protein
interactions. With a conﬁdence cutoff of 0.5, the resulting AUCs
are 0.760 :l: 0.010 for human targets and 0.797 :l: 0.016 for mouse
targets, and with a cutoff of 0.7, the AUCs are 0.762 :l: 0.011
for human and 0.820 :l: 0.024 for mouse targets.

3.2 Targets in different protein families can be predicted
with different accuracy

We further investigated whether our approach is more successful
for particular protein families or particular drug categories. For
this purpose, we performed our analysis for each of the top-level
InterPro (Mulder et al., 2005) protein families. To maintain stat-
istical signiﬁcance, we restrict our analysis to protein families
in which we could identify >5 positive instances from our evalu-
ation datasets, resulting in only six protein families for which
we perform the analysis using the two STITCH-based evaluation
datasets. The resulting ROCAUCs are shown in Table l and
Figure 3. The ROC AUCs range from 0.222 :l: 0.339 (for
NAD(P)-binding domain proteins) to 0.927 :l: 0.083 (for
Steroid hormone receptor proteins).

We further performed our analysis for different categories of
drugs to test whether our approach is more successful for some
classes of drugs than for others. For this purpose, we divide
drugs into different groups based on their top-level category in
the anatomical therapeutic classiﬁcation (Miller and Britt, 1995)
and evaluated each group individually (Supplementary Table S1
and Supplementary Fig. S1).

3.3 Example prediction: diclofenac

One example of our method’s predictive power is the identiﬁca-
tion of similar effects between PPARg (MGI : 97747) and the
drug diclofenac (STITCH: 000003032). Diclofenac is a non-
steroidal anti-inﬂammatory drug acting primarily as a cycloox-
ygenase (preferential COX -2) inhibitor and is used to treat a
variety of acute and chronic pain and inﬂammatory conditions.
In recent years, additional modes of action have been discerned
which in many cases have no known mechanism. For example,
diclofenac has been shown to inhibit the thromboxane—prosta—
noid receptor, affect arachidonic acid release and uptake, inhibit
lipoxygenase enzymes and activate the nitric oxide-cGMP anti-
nociceptive pathway (Gan, 2010). Using our approach, we have
compared the drug effect proﬁle of diclofenac across the

gathered phenotypic data and found a high similarity to pheno-
types produced by Pparg knockout mice. Using our method,
49% of the information content associated with diclofenac’s
pharmacological effects can be explained through the hypothesis
that it inhibits Pparg or its pathway in mice. Pparg is a member
of the steroid hormone receptor superfamily, which includes
the estrogen and thyroid hormone receptors, and regulates the
expression of genes involved in inﬂammation and lipid homeo-
stasis. Despite its anti-inﬂammatory indications, diclofenac is
associated with the induction of dermatitis, alopecia, erythema,
exfoliative dermatitis and eczema, along with hepatitis and other
widespread systemic phenotypes. Several of these phenotypes
can also be identiﬁed in mice (Harries and Paus, 2009; Wahli,
2002). In 2002, diclofenac was implicated as a partial agonist
of Pparg, acting as a competitive antagonist and inhibiting
PPARg signaling at normal therapeutic doses (Adamson et al.,
2002), suggesting that a signiﬁcant proportion of diclofenac’s
side effects might be explained through this mechanism. The
apparent pro-inﬂammatory effects of diclofenac seen, for
example, in the skin are, therefore, likely to be a consequence
of the effects on the Pparg pathway in non-immune cells, and
recent research suggests that it is the effect on the inhibition
of PPARg in the pilosebaceceous unit itself that underlies pri-
mary cicatricial alopecia, rather than a primary effect on the
inﬂammatory response (Kamik et al., 2009).

We would expect the effects of diclofenac to be concordant
with loss of function phenotypes in mutants of its established
target, cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2). A substantial proportion
(46%) of the IC associated with the side effects of diclofenac
can be explained through COX-2 (Ptgs2) knockout phenotypes
in mice. For example, the main gastrointestinal effects of diclo-
fenac (inﬂammation, gastritis, constipation, upper GI tract pain)
are consistent with the phenotypes of COX2 knockout mice, as
evidenced by the sensitization to inﬂammatory processes such as
induction of colitis, the induction of GI edema and peritonitis
seen in COX-2 knockout mice (Morteau et al., 2000).

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Choice of semantic similarity measure

The semantic similarity measure we developed for our application
has some disadvantages in comparison with symmetric measures,
and these are evidenced in the low performance of our approach
for low false-positive rates. In particular, for very low false-posi-
tive rates, our approach performs worse than random. This lack
of performance is a result of our similarity measure, which does
not take mismatches between phenotypes into consideration but
is based exclusively on coverage. A small portion of mouse genes is
associated with a large number of phenotypes which almost
always cover a large portion of observed drug effects for any
drug, and a small portion of drugs is similarly associated with
a large number of drug effects in SIDER that cover most observed
mouse model phenotypes. For example, the genes Gt( ROSA )
26Sor (gene trap ROSA 26, Philippe Soriano) (MGI : 104735),
phosphatase and tensin homolog (Pten, MGI :1 09 583), apolipo-
protein E (Apoe MGI : 88057) or leptin receptor (Lepr,
MGI : 10 49 93) are associated with a large number of phenotypes
covering most branches of the MP and are ranked among the ﬁrst
mouse genes for most compounds in SIDER. Similarly, drugs
such as pregabalin (STITCH: 005486971) or ﬂuoxetine
(STITCH:000003386) are associated with a large number of
drug effects in SIDER and are ranked in the ﬁrst places for
most mouse genes. These artifacts of our similarity measure
result in a decreased performance when analyzing the complete
dataset and not applying any additional ﬁltering. In particular,
the highest-ranking associations resulting from our approach are,
in most cases, false positives due to the artifacts generated by the
similarity measure, and these artifacts result in a worse-than-
random performance in the ROC analysis for low false-positive
rates.

However, our measure also has signiﬁcant advantages over
symmetric similarity measures. We have evaluated commonly
applied groupwise similarity measures (Pesquita et al., 2009)

for our dataset, in particular the J accard index and the SimGIC
measure. We found the results to be signiﬁcantly worse than
when applying our measure [ROCAUC values are 0.579 for
STITCH (mouse) and 0.566 for STITCH (human); raw data
available on project Web site]. The major difference between
our similarity measure and groupwise measures such as
SimGIC is the symmetry property. In particular, symmetric
groupwise similarity measures score mismatches negatively. In
our application, we compare large sets of phenotypes observed
as drug effects with the phenotypes observed for single gene de-
letions in mice. If different drug effects are caused by different
proteins with which the drug interacts, we expect only a small
portion of the effects to be covered by the phenotypes of a single
gene knockout. Negatively scoring all non-matching drug effects
introduces noise that increases with the number of drug effects
and leads to the signiﬁcantly lower performance in the ROC
analysis. Furthermore, symmetric similarity measures are applic-
able when comparing essentially similar entities. As most
chemical compounds in SIDER interact with many proteins,
we compare sets of phenotypes resulting from perturbations of
many proteins (drug effects) with sets of phenotypes resulting
from perturbations of single proteins, and in the case of compar-
ing non-similar entities such as drug effects and knockout pheno-
types, our non-symmetric similarity measure seems to perform
better than symmetric groupwise measures.

4.2 Applications in drug repurposing and target discovery

The results of our analyses support the hypothesis that the sys-
tematic analysis of similarity between drug effects and mouse
model phenotypes can be used to provide insights into drug
actions. Although experimental validation is required to deter-
mine the suitability of such an approach for the discovery of
novel drug targets, our computational evaluation shows that,
at least for some protein families, our approach is highly success-
ful (up to 0.927 :I: 0.083 ROCAUC), and therefore may prove
promising for integrative approaches toward computational drug
repurposing. Our approach is less successful for some protein
classes, such as voltage-dependent potassium channel or
NAD(P)-binding domain proteins. However, our evaluation
datasets contain relatively few positive instances for such classes,
indicated by the conﬁdence intervals in Figure 3.

Our work further conﬁrms the hypothesis of Kuhn et al.
(2013), who mapped 116 mouse phenotype terms to drug effect
terms and evaluated 398 knockout mice in an effort to identify
proteins that underlie particular drug effects. Kuhn et al. formu-
lated the hypothesis ‘that a deletion of a protein in mice is likely
to elicit the same phenotype as inhibiting the respective ortholog
in humans despite species and methodology differences’.
However, while Kuhn et al. used this approach in the context
of investigating the role of proteins in eliciting drug side effects,
our approach provides evidence for the potential of applying
mouse models for revealing novel drug-target interactions.
Additionally, we systematically evaluated the whole mouse
phenome and provide a ranked list of candidate drug targets
spanning all drugs in the SIDER database and every protein
for which phenotypes have been created in the mouse.

Integrative approaches to drug repurposing and drug target
identiﬁcation take advantage of multiple independent data

sources to provide high-conﬁdence predictions of novel indica-
tions or novel targets for known drugs (Dudley et al., 2011;
Hurle et al., 2013). Our approach will be most useful as a com-
ponent in integrative approaches to drug repurposing or target
identiﬁcation. In both tasks, the use of animal models is cur-
rently largely under-represented despite its potential to provide
novel, independent information that strengthens already success-
ful systems (Hurle et al., 2013).

Furthermore, our method is neither based on the ‘guilt-by—
association’ principle (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2012) as is applied in
side effect-based approaches to drug repurposing (Campillos
et al., 2008) or other similarity-based approaches (Gottlieb
et al., 2011) nor is our method based on data mining clinical
records (Tatonetti et al., 2012); instead, it uses experimental
data from genetically modiﬁed animal organisms. Our evalu-
ation demonstrates that our method may even be used independ-
ently for some categories of targets, particularly steroid hormone
receptors, although additional experimental validation is
required to further support this hypothesis.

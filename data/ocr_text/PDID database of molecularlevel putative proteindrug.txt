Abstract

Motivation: Many drugs interact with numerous proteins besides their intended therapeutic targets
and a substantial portion of these interactions is yet to be elucidated. Protein—Drug Interaction
Database (PDID) addresses incompleteness of these data by providing access to putative protein—
drug interactions that cover the entire structural human proteome.

Results: PDID covers 9652 structures from 3746 proteins and houses 16 800 putative interactions
generated from close to 1.1 million accurate, all—atom structure—based predictions for several doz—
ens of popular drugs. The predictions were generated with three modern methods: lLbind, SMAP
and eFindSite. They are accompanied by propensity scores that quantify likelihood of interactions
and coordinates of the putative location of the binding drugs in the corresponding protein struc—
tures. PDID complements the current databases that focus on the curated interactions and the
BioDrugScreen database that relies on docking to find putative interactions. Moreover, we also in—
clude experimentally curated interactions which are linked to their sources: DrugBank, BindingDB
and Protein Data Bank. Our database can be used to facilitate studies related to polypharmacology
of drugs including repurposing and explaining side effects of drugs.

Availability and implementation: PDID database is freely available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.

1 Introduction

 

Majority of the molecular targets of drugs are proteins (Overington
et 61]., 2006; Rask—Andersen et 61]., 2014) and there are several data—
bases of the already characterized protein—drug interactions.
DrugBank (Law et 61]., 2014; Wishart et 61]., 2006) provides access to
biochemical and pharmacological information about a large set of
7759 drugs, including 1600 Food and Drug Administration (FDA)-

approved compounds, and their known 4104 protein targets.
Therapeutic Target Database (Zhu et 61]., 2010, 2012) offers a com—
prehensive coverage of over 20 000 drugs, including close to 15 000
experimental drugs, and their interactions With 2360 protein targets.
This database also links targets and drugs to about 900 diseases.
Other databases expand beyond the drug molecules to cover small
drug-like ligands. BindingDB (Liu et 61]., 2007) gives experimentally

measured binding affinities between about 7000 known protein tar—
gets and a large set of almost half a million of small ligands. ChEMBL
(Bento et al., 2014; Gaulton et al., 2012) contains structures,
physicochemical properties and bioactivity (e.g. binding constants,
pharmacology data) of drug—like small molecules. The current release
of ChEMBL incorporates 1.7 million distinct compounds and 13.5
million bioactivity data points which are mapped to over 10 thousand
protein targets, where the corresponding binding sites are defined at
varying levels of granularity (protein, protein domain or residue level).
SuperTarget (Hecker et al., 2012) includes about 6200 protein targets
from several dozens of species and close to 200 000 drug—like com—
pounds. It integrates drug—related information from BindingDB,
DrugBank and the SuperCyp database of cytochrome—drug inter—
actions (Preissner et al., 2010), adverse drug effects from SIDER
(Kuhn et al., 2010a), drug metabolism and pathways and Gene
Ontology (GO) terms for the target proteins. The PROMISCUOUS
database (von Eichborn et al., 2011) integrates data from DrugBank,
SuperTarget and SuperCyp and covers about 6500 protein targets and
over 25 thousands drug—like compounds that are annotated with side
effects. This database also provides facilities that can be used to pre—
dict novel targets based on structural similarity between drugs and be—
tween side effect profiles of drugs. STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2010b,
2014) combines information from many sources of experimentally
and manually curated interactions between small ligands and proteins
including ChEMBL, Protein Data Bank (PDB), DrugBank,
Therapeutic Target Database, text mining of articles from MEDLINE
and PubMed and several other resources. It currently houses data on
390 000 chemicals and 3.6 million proteins. The recently released
IntSide database (Juan—Blanco et al., 2015) links about 1000 drugs
with their human protein targets collected from DrugBank and
STITCH, and with close to 1200 side effects and other annotations of
associated diseases, pathways and cellular functions. Although most
of these resources summarize the interactions at the protein or residue
level, scPDB (Desaphy et al., 2015; Meslamani et al., 2011) includes
molecular—level (all—atom) information for native binding sites in pro-
teins structures collected from PDB (Berman et al., 2000) that are suit—
able for docking of drug—like ligands. It includes molecular—level
details of about 9200 binding sites (all—atom annotation of binding
sites and list of ligand—binding residues grouped by various types of
bonds) and binding modes (all—atom position of ligand inside the site)
in 3600 proteins, and summary of physicochemical properties of ap—
proximately 5600 drug—like ligands.

However, many of the established drugs interact not only with
the intended therapeutic target protein(s) but also with other protein
targets (off—targets). Individual compounds were shown to on aver—
age target 6.3 proteins (Hu and Bajorath, 2013; Mestres et al.,
2008). Given a high degree of incompleteness of this information
(Mestres et al., 2008; Peters, 2013), the number of off—targets is
likely substantially higher. To compare, DrugBank includes 15 199
protein—drug interactions for 7759 drugs with the average number
of targets per drug at 1.96, which further substantiates incomplete—
ness of the currently available data. Moreover, this polypharmacol—
ogy can be both beneficial if a given drug can be repurposed for a
different disease and harmful, leading to side effects (Peters, 2013).
A couple of high-profile examples include imatinib that was repur—
posed for treatment of gastrointestinal stromal tumors (Hirota et al.,
1998) and sorafenib for the kidney and liver cancers (Wilhelm et al.,
2006). The incompleteness of the data combined with the import—
ance of polypharmacology motivates research toward elucidation of
novel protein—drug interactions. Conventional (non—computational)
methods for the identification of novel off—targets rely on an in vitro
counter—screen of a given drug against a ‘large’ set of enzymes and

receptors (Bass et al., 2004). Recognizing corresponding implications
related to side effects, pharmaceutical companies have implemented
screening protocols for the drugs that they currently develop. For in—
stance, Novartis screens against interactions with a panel of 24 targets
associated with serious side effects and high hit rates (Urban, 2012),
Pfizer screens against between 15 and 30 targets (Wang and Greene,
2012), and Roche uses a panel of 48 targets (Bendels, 2013).

Compared with the experimental screens, computational methods
that find novel drug targets are more cost— and time—effective, allow
screening of a larger number of targets and provide insights into the
molecular—level mechanisms of protein—drug interactions
(MacDonald et al., 2006). These in silico methods are successful in
the context of drug repositioning and identification of off—targets (Liu
et al., 2013). A couple of databases that focus on the putative pro—
tein—drug and druggable protein—protein interactions (PPIs) were re—
cently released. BioDrugScreen (Li et al., 2010) stores results of
docking of about 1600 small drug—like molecules against 1589 known
proteins targets in human, which were annotated based on DrugBank
and HCPIN (Huang et al., 2008) databases. Docking was ran for
close to 2000 cavities on the surfaces of these proteins, for the total of
about 3 million receptor—ligand complexes. Druggable Protein—
Protein Interaction Assessment System (Dr. PIAS) (Sugaya and
Furuya, 2011; Sugaya et al., 2012) is a database of druggable PPIs
predicted by a machine learning method. This database lists druggable
interactions predicted from over 83 thousand PPIs in human, mouse
and rat but they are not associated with specific compounds.

We developed Protein—Drug Interaction Database (PDID) that
complements existing repositories and addresses the lack of access
to a comprehensive set of putative protein—drug interactions. Based
on close to 1.1 million of all—atom predictions over the entire struc—
tural human proteome (10 thousand structures for over 3700 pro—
teins), PDID provides access to all putative targets (between 4444
and 7184, depending on the prediction method used) of several doz—
ens of popular drugs. Unique features of our database are:

° It incorporates accurate predictions generated by three methods,
ILbind (Hu et al., 2012), SMAP (Xie and Bourne, 2008) and
eFindSite (Brylinski and Feinstein, 2013; Feinstein and Brylinski,
2014), which are complementary and independent of docking
that was used in the BioDrugScreen database

° It uniformly covers the entire structural human proteome

° It includes molecular—level information on localization of the pu—
tative binding sites in the structures of the corresponding protein
targets

° It includes comprehensive annotations of known drug targets
that are linked to their sources: DrugBank, BindingDB and PDB

The methods that we use were shown empirically to provide
high—quality predictions of drug targets (Hu et al., 2012) and their
results were already successfully used to predict novel off—targets.
Examples include applications to find new off—targets of estrogen re—
ceptor modulators (Xie et al., 2007), cholesteryl ester transfer pro—
tein inhibitors (Xie et al., 2009b), comtan (Kinnings et al., 2009),
inhibitors of Trypanosoma brucei RNA editing ligase 1 (Durrant
et al., 2010), nelfinavir (Xie et al., 2011), raloxifene (Sui et al.,
2012) and cyclosporine A (Hu et al., 2014b).

Xie et al. (2007) we kept proteins for which sequences were mapped

to human proteins in Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2002). More specif—

ically, structures of chains with at least 90% sequence identity quan—
tified using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1990) with default parameters to
any human protein from 68th release of Ensembl were selected. As a

result, we include total of 9652 human and human-like high reso-

lution structures that correspond to 3746 unique human proteins;

the structures are listed at http://biomine—ws.ece.ualberta.ca/PDID/

files/list_proteome.txt. Protein chains that correspond to PDB struc—

tures were mapped to UniProt (Consortium, 2012) to facilitate map—

ping of proteins between PDID, PDB, DrugBank and BindingDB.

The database includes drugs which were solved structurally in

complex with at least one protein; this is necessary to predict targets.
There are 355 such drugs in PDB which we extracted with PDBsum
(de Beer et al., 2014). The current release 1.1 includes 51 drugs,
compared with the release 1.0 that had 26 drugs. These compounds

are listed in Table 1 and include popular antibiotics, anti-inﬂamma-

tory, antiviral and anticancers agents, immunosuppressants and

drugs for the treatment of osteoporosis, diabetes, heart attack,

hypertension, edema, angina, glaucoma and other diseases. The cur—

rently included compounds comprehensively sample the structural

drug space; we clustered structures of the 355 drugs using their

sampled at least one drug from each of the resulting 25 clusters to
select the 51 compounds.

2.2 Putative protein—drug interactions

Prediction of binding sites from protein structures for a given ligand
(drug) are done by searching for sites that are similar to the known
sites of this ligand, which are extracted from the structure(s) of the
protein—drug complex(es) or by docking the ligand to all binding
sites. There are three classes of prediction methods that implement
different trade—offs between accuracy and computational cost. These
methods are based on searching for the similar sites using a reduced
representation of protein structure or complete all—atom structure of
protein, and by docking the all—atom structure of ligand into the all—
atom structure of the target proteins.

The fastest class of methods utilizes the reduced representation,
usually in a form of a numeric vector that summarizes geometry and
physicochemical properties of binding sites. Representative ex—
amples of such methods that find similar binding sites are
PatchSurfer (Hu et al., 2014a; Zhu et al., 2015) and method by
Tomii’s group (Ito et al., 2012a). The latter algorithm was recently
used to create the PoSSuM database (Ito et al., 2012b, 2015) that in—
cludes 49 million pairs of similar binding sites computed from the
known binding sites of 194 drug—like molecules over all protein
structures from PDB. Given the large number of these putative sites
it is likely that many of them are false positives and would have to
be further screened via a more advanced method.

The second class of methods that is characterized by a lower
throughput performs docking of a given compounds into protein
structures to find which proteins harbor binding sites that are com—
plementary to the given ligand. An example platform that utilizes
such type of docking to find targets of a given ligand is INVDOCK
(Ji et al., 2006). Given the relatively high computational cost of
docking, we highlight the availability of the BioDrugScreen database
(Li et al., 2010). This database stores results of docking with
AutoDock and scores these putative interactions based on several
scoring functions, such as AutoDock, GoldScore, X—Score,
ChemScore, PMF and DFIRE. This docking—based database covers
about 1600 drug—like molecules and 2000 cavities on the surfaces of
close to 1600 human proteins. However, these results are limited to
interactions that are localized in pockets/cavities on the protein sur—
face rather than exploring the whole surface. This is motivated by
prohibitively high computational costs of searching the entire sur—
face. BioDrugScreen uses Relibase—l— algorithm (Hendlich et al.,
2003) to identify pockets of interest, while INVDOCK uses an older
algorithm by Kuntz et al. (1982).

Our database takes advantage of the third class of methods that
are complementary to docking. These methods are not constrained
to surface pockets and produce accurate predictions of the protein—
drug binding at the molecular level. They implement inverse ligand
binding where structure(s) of known protein—drug complex(es),
called template(s), is used to predict other protein targets together
with the corresponding binding sites for the same drug. There are
two ways to find novel binding sites based on similarity to known
binding sites, one based on the similarity of the corresponding pro-
tein fold and another based on similarity of binding pockets. The
first approach is implemented by the eFindSite method (Brylinski
and Feinstein, 2013; Feinstein and Brylinski, 2014) and the other ap-
proach by the SMAP algorithm (Xie and Bourne, 2008). The
eFindSite predictor is an improved version of FINDSITE method
(Brylinski and Skolnick, 2008; Skolnick and Brylinski, 2009) that

uses meta—threading with eThread (Brylinski and Lingam, 2012) and
the Affinity Propagation clustering algorithm (Frey and Dueck,
2007) to optimize selection of the ligand—bound templates for a
given query structure. It was empirically shown to outperform
FINDSITE and several geometrical methods for detection of pockets
(Brylinski and Feinstein, 2013). SMAP is based on a sequence order
independent profile—profile alignment (SOIPPA) which finds evolu-
tionary and functional relationships across the space of protein struc—
tures (Xie and Bourne, 2007, 2008; Xie et al., 2009a). SMAP utilizes
a shape descriptor to characterize the structure of the protein template
and the SOIPPA algorithm to detect and align similar pockets between
the query and template proteins. We also include results from a novel
meta—method ILbind (Hu et al., 2012), which is a machine learning-
based consensus of 15 support vector machines that combines predic—
tion scores generated by SMAP and FINDSITE. Details concerning
how predictions are performed with SMAP, FINDSITE and ILbind
are given in Hu et al. (2012). Our recent article shows that ILbind,
SMAP and FINDSITE accurately predict targets even when the corres—
ponding structure of the query protein and the template(s) are substan—
tially different, i.e. they are from different Structural Classification of
Proteins (SCOP) folds. The corresponding average (over three tested
ligands) areas under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
(AUCs) equal 0.727, 0.693 and 0.687 for ILbind, SMAP and
FINDSITE, respectively (Hu et al., 2012). These results justify our use
of the three predictors on the proteome scale.

The PDID database provides access to precomputed results of
computationally expensive all—atom predictions by eFindSite and
SMAP. Their average runtime for a single protein structure and a
given drug is about 30 min on a single processor; the runtime of
ILbind is negligible since it is based a consensus of results generated
by the two predictors. This high computational cost makes ad 1906
predictions for a given user query (a given drug or a given protein)
computationally impractical.

3 Results

3.1 Assessment of predictive quality
We assessed predictive performance of ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite
on a set of 25 representative drugs that are included in PDID. These
compounds were selected from 25 clusters of chemically similar drug
structures (one compound from each cluster) that were generated
from the 355 drugs that can be found in complex with proteins in
PDB. The evaluation follows the protocol from (Hu et al., 2014b).
Brieﬂy, native targets of the 25 drugs were collected from PDB,
BindingDB and DrugBank, and we compare predictions from the
three methods on the structural human proteome against these native
targets. We clustered proteins in the structural human proteome at
90% identity using BLASTCLUST and evaluated the results on the
corresponding clusters, i.e. a given cluster is considered to be a native
target of given drug (predicted to bind the drug) if at least one protein
in this cluster shares at least 90% identity with a native target of that
drug (at least one protein in this cluster is predicted to bind that drug).
The clustering assures that the evaluation is not biased toward targets
that are overrepresented with many structures of similar folds.
Empirical results demonstrate that the three methods are charac—
terized by high predictive quality. The average AUCs over the 25
drugs of eFindSite, SMAP and ILbind equal 0.630, 0.740 and 0.761,
respectively (Fig. 1A). Although ILbind outperforms the other two
methods, which is expected from this meta—method and consistent
with results in Hu et al. (2012), different methods perform better for
different ligands. More specifically, eFindSite provides the highest

Fig.2. Number of native and putative targets for the considered 51 drugs. The native targets are based on annotations from PDB, DrugBank and BindingDB. The
predictions were generated by lLbind, SMAP and eFindSite. The drugs, which are shown on the x—axis, are sorted by their corresponding number of targets in the

descending order and separately for each of the four annotations

AUC for 5 drugs, SMAP for 6 drugs and ILbind for the remaining
14 drugs. Figure 1B gives average true positive rates (fractions of
correctly predicted native targets) in the function of the fraction of
predicted protein targets sorted in the descending order by the
propensities for the interaction generated by each of the three
predictors. It shows that 40% of the native targets (true positive rate
= 0.4) are found in the top 4% of predictions from ILbind and
SMAP and in top 14% of predictions from eFindSite.

We note that predictive performance varies between compounds
and primarily depends on their size. Higher AUCs are characteristic
for medium sized drugs (with molecular weight between 200 and
400 g/mol) and lower AUCs for either small (below 200 g/mol) or
large (over 400 g/mol) drugs. To compare, the average AUCs for the
small/medium/large drugs for eFindSite, SMAP and ILbind are 0.5 6/
068/058, 0.7/0.83/0.58 and 0.7/0.86/0.59, respectively. Example
small and large compounds for which predictive quality is relatively
low are salicyclic acid (138.1 g/mol; average AUC over the
three methods of 0.50), isoflurane (184.5 g/mol; 0.60), suramin
(1297.3 g/mol; 0.55) and cyanocobalamin (1355.4 g/mol; 0.57).

Example drugs for which prediction are more accurate are naproxen
(230.3 g/mol; 0.88), furosemide (330.7g/mol; 0.94) and prednisone
(358.4 g/mol; 0.87).

3.2 Database contents and availability

PDID is freely available at http://biomine.ece.ualberta.ca/PDID/.
The backend is implemented with the relational MS MySQL data—
base and webpages use PHP script. Protein targets are linked to
PDB, UniProt, BindingDB and DrugBank. Drugs are linked to the
corresponding records in PDB, BindingDB and DrugBank. Protein
and drugs are linked with each other through their known and puta—
tive interactions. The interactions are defined at molecular level, i.e.
coordinates of the location of the drug in the protein structure file
are included. Besides displaying this information in the browser win-
dow, PDID allows to download the source files with the sequence
and structure of the target proteins. We also offer download of the
parsable raw source datasets in text format under the Section 2.1 on
the main page. They include the current version of the structural

human proteome (IDs of all considered protein structures), list of
drugs and predicted targets for each drug together with scores from
each of the three prediction methods and the corresponding coordin—
ates of the putative binding sites.

The current version of PDID includes results of about 1.1 million
predictions of targets over the 10 thousand structures and 51 drugs
with the corresponding 5172, 7184 and 4444 putative targets gener—
ated by ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite. It also includes 730 known
targets of the 51 drugs mapped from and linked to the correspond—
ing records in DrugBank, BindingDB and PDB. Figure 2 shows the
number of native and putative targets for each drug. The median
number of putative protein—drug interactions equals 23, 30 and 31
for SMAP, eFindSite and ILbind, respectively, compared with the
median of eight based on the known interactions collected from
DrugBank, BindingDB and PDB.

The database will be updated semiannually by adding additional
drugs and proteins. The initial version 1.0 that included 26 drugs
was released in October 2014 and the current version 1.1 in April
2015. This schedule is consistent with other related resources, e.g.
scPDB is updated annually, ChEMBL is updated twice a year and
DrugBank was recently updated in April 2015 (version 4.2), May
2014 (version 4.1) and December 2013 (version 4.0).

3.3 User interface

The main page includes overview of the contents of the database, ac—
cess to three available search types (by drug name, by ID of the pro-
tein target and by sequence of the protein target), links to the source
datasets and related resources and date of the last update. It also in—
cludes link to the ‘About’ page that explains contents of the database
and introduces related methods and the ‘Help 86 Tutorial’ page that
explains the interface of the main page and the three types of output
pages that correspond to the three search types.

The search by drug name returns a table with details of known
and putative targets including links to the corresponding records in
PDB, DrugBank and BindingDB, links to files with structure and se—
quence of each target and propensities for binding outputted by
ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite (Fig. 3A). Targets are sorted by the
number of methods that predict them as binding (propensities
shown in green font indicate prediction of binding) and by the scores
generated by the most accurate ILbind when the number is the
same. Detailed description of the formatting and contents of this
output page can be found at http://biomine—ws.ece.ualberta.ca/
PDID/help.html#drug_page. Each target protein is available as a
link that leads to a webpage with the summary of results for this
target.

The search by protein ID returns a webpage that maps this ID
into corresponding UniProt protein (quality of mapping is annotated
using sequence similarity), gives links to the sequence and structure
files, provides customizable visualization of the structure together
with the localization of the putative (red dots) and known (blue
sticks) ligands, and a table that summarizes information about drugs
that are known and predicted to bind this protein (Fig. 3B). This in-
formation includes color—coded scores generated by each methods
that generated prediction and the corresponding predicted location
of the drug in the protein structure. We use JSmol (Hanson et al.,
2013) to visualize structures and BLAST to compute sequence
similarity. Detailed description of this webpage is available at http://
biomine—ws.ece.ualberta.ca/PDID/help.html# prot_page.

The search based on protein sequence invokes BLAST that com—
pares the input chain with the target sequences included in the data—
bases. The most similar target is selected given that its similarity

4 Discussion

Numerous drugs are highly promiscuous and we do not know many
of their targets. PDID database addresses this issue by providing ac—
cess to a complete set of putative protein—drug interactions and a set
of known protein—drug interactions in the structural human prote—
ome. Our database includes data that otherwise would be accessible
only to individuals and research groups with significant computa—
tional expertise and resources. The putative interactions were gener—
ated by three accurate predictors, ILbind, SMAP and eFindSite, that
were shown to produce results that led to finding new drug targets
(Durrant et al., 2010; Hu et al., 2014b; Kinnings et al., 2009; Sui
et al., 2012; Xie et al., 2007, 2009, 2011) and which complement the
existing BioDrugScreen database that relies on docking. The database

also integrates annotations of known protein targets collected across
DrugBank, BindingDB and PDB, links proteins to the corresponding
records in UniProt and provides coordinates of the location of binding
sites in the structures of the putative drug targets.

PDID can be used to systematically catalog protein—drug inter—
actions and to facilitate various studies related to polypharmacology
of drugs (Xie, 2012), such as explaining side effects caused by inter—
actions with off—targets and for the drug repurposing. Relevant re—
cent examples include use of predictions with ILbind to find three
novel off—targets of cyclosporine A that explain nephrotoxicity asso—
ciated with use of this immunosuppressant (Hu et al., 2014b).
Another example involves repurposing of raloxifene, which is used
for prevention and treatment of osteoporosis, as a potential com—
pound to treat Pseudomonas aeruginosa infections based on predic—
tions with the SMAP method (Sui et al., 2012).

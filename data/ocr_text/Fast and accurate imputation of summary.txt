ABSTRACT

Motivation: lmputation using external reference panels (e.g. 1000
Genomes) is a widely used approach for increasing power in
genome-wide association studies and meta-analysis. Existing hidden
Markov models (HMM)-based imputation approaches require individ-
ual-level genotypes. Here, we develop a new method for Gaussian
imputation from summary association statistics, a type of data that
is becoming widely available.

Results: In simulations using 1000 Genomes (1000G) data, this
method recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size for
common (>5%) and low-frequency (1—5%) variants [increasing to
87% (60%) when summary linkage disequilibrium information is avail-
able from target samples] versus the gold standard of 89% (67%) for
HMM-based imputation, which cannot be applied to summary statis-
tics. Our approach accounts for the limited sample size of the refer-
ence panel, a crucial step to eliminate false-positive associations, and
it is computationally very fast. As an empirical demonstration, we
apply our method to seven case—control phenotypes from the
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WT CCC) data and a
study of height in the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC). Gaussian
imputation from summary statistics recovers 95% (105%) of the ef-
fective sample size (as quantified by the ratio of X2 association stat-
istics) compared with HMM-based imputation from individual-level
genotypes at the 227 (176) published single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) in the WTCCC (1958BC height) data. In addition, for publicly
available summary statistics from large meta-analyses of four lipid
traits, we publicly release imputed summary statistics at 1000G
SNPs, which could not have been obtained using previously published
methods, and demonstrate their accuracy by masking subsets of the
data. We show that 1000G imputation using our approach increases
the magnitude and statistical evidence of enrichment at genic versus
non-genic loci for these traits, as compared with an analysis without
1000G imputation. Thus, imputation of summary statistics will be a
valuable tool in future functional enrichment analyses.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are the prevailing ap-
proach for ﬁnding disease risk loci, having successfully identified
thousands of variants associated to complex phenotypes
(Hindorff et al., 2009). An important component of the
GWAS analysis toolkit is genotype imputation, an approach
that leverages publicly available data [e.g. 1000 Genomes
(1000G; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012)] to esti-
mate genotypes at markers untyped in the study to increase
power for finding new risk loci (Browning and Browning,
2007; Howie et al., 2012; Li et al., 2010; Marchini and Howie,
2010a). In addition to GWAS, genotype imputation is a key
component in meta-analysis of studies that use different genotyp-
ing platforms, where single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs)
that were genotyped in one study can be imputed in the other
studies, thus increasing the association power (Estrada et al.,
2012; Lango Allen et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2010; Morris et al.,
2012).

Many approaches for genotype imputation have been pro-
posed, with methods based on hidden Markov models (HMM)
showing the highest accuracy in simulations and empirical data
(Browning and Browning, 2007; Howie et al., 2012; Li et al.,
2010; Marchini and Howie, 2010a). However, privacy and logis-
tic constraints often prohibit access to individual-level genotype
data, thus precluding HMM-based imputation, whereas sum-
mary association statistics are becoming widely available. For
example, summary statistics are required to be publicly released
for any GWAS published in Nature Genetics and have been

lmputation of summary statistics

 

publicly released for many traits (Nature Genetics, 2012; Schork
et al., 2013).

In this work, we propose methods for testing association at
SNPs untyped in the study when only summary association
statistics are available at the typed SNPs. Unlike HMM-based
imputation from individual-level genotypes, our proposed
approach requires only the association statistics at typed variants
as input. To accomplish this, we approximate the distribution
of association statistics at a given locus using a multivariate
Gaussian. Previous studies have shown that a Gaussian
approximation of linkage disequilibrium (LD) leads to accurate
inference across a wide range of problems (Conneely and
Boehnke, 2007; Han et al., 2009; McPeek, 2012; Wen
and Stephens, 2010; Zaitlen et al., 2010). In particular, (\Nen
and Stephens, 2010) highlighted the potential utility of
Gaussian imputation methods for individual-level and pooled
data, but that study did not provide methods or software for
imputation from summary association statistics (see Section 4).

Through extensive simulations based on 1000G data, we show
that our approach is almost as powerful as the gold standard
of HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes, and
is able to avoid an increase in false-positive associations by
accounting for the limited size of the reference panel. Our
approach recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size
for common (>5%) and low-frequency (1—5%) variants versus
89% (67%) for HMM-based imputation, with a reduction in
running time of several orders of magnitude. When summary
information on the pairwise LD structure among typed variants
in GWAS samples is made available [as is also recommended in
other contexts (Lee et al., 2013b)], our method recovers 87%
(60%) of the effective sample size, again with no increase in
false-positive associations.

We validate our approach using real GWAS data from
Wellcome Trust Case Control Consortium (WTCCC) across
seven phenotypes as well as a height GWAS from the 1958
Birth Cohort (1958BC), where we show that Gaussian imput-
ation from summary statistics recovers the same signal as
HMM-based imputation from individual-level genotypes, with
no increase in false-positive rate. For example, we attain an
average X2 association statistic of 18.28 as compared with
19.17 for HMM-based imputation at the 227 published SNPs
in the WTCCC data and 4.76 (versus 4.55 for HMM-based
imputation) at the 176 published SNPs in the l958BC height
data.

For publicly available summary statistics from large meta-
analyses of four lipid traits [triglycerides (TG), total cholesterol
(TC), high density lipoprotein (HDL) and low density lipopro-
tein (LDL)], we publicly release imputed summary statistics
at 1000G SNPs, which could not have been obtained using
previously published methods. We validate the accuracy of the
imputed statistics across the four studies using a masking
approach and show that we attain a correlation of 0.98 (0.95)
to masked summary statistics for common (low-frequency)
variants, consistent with simulations. Finally, we explore the util-
ity of imputed association statistics to functional enrichment
analysis (Schork et al., 2013). For the four lipid traits, we ﬁnd
that imputed data increase the magnitude and statistical evidence
of enrichment at genie versus non-genie loci, as compared
with an analysis without 1000G imputation (Schork et al., 2013).

2 METHODS
2.1 Overview of Gaussian imputation of summary
statistics

We assume that summary association statistics consist of z—scores known
to be normally distributed with mean 0 and variance 1 under the null
model of no association. LD between SNPs i and j induces a covariance
between their observed z—scores, according to the correlation rij between
the two SNPs. Thus, under null data, the vector Z of z—scores at all SNPs
in a locus is approximately distributed as a Gaussian distribution,
Z~N(0, E), with 2 being the correlation matrix among all pairs of
SNPs induced by LD (EU-=5) (see Supplementary Note). In a given
study, we only observe z—scores at the typed SNPs (Zt), with no informa-
tion about untyped SNPs. We estimate 2 using reference panels of haplo-
types (e.g. 1000G) and analytically derive the posterior mean of z—scores
at unobserved SNPs (Z,) given Z, and 2 (ImpG—Summary). We use the
conditional variance to estimate the imputation accuracy (rzpred), in a
manner similar to the rzhat estimator in HMM-based imputation (Li
et al., 2010).

The ﬁnite sample size of the reference panel adds statistical noise to the
estimate of 2. We account for noisy estimates at distant SNPs by using a
windowing strategy that models distant SNPs as uncorrelated. This strat-
egy also leads to efﬁcient computational runtime (a smaller matrix needs
to be inverted for each window in the genome). In particular, we partition
the genome into non-overlapping windows (e.g. 1 Mb), and for each
window independently, we estimate the LD matrix 2 using the reference
panel of haplotypes. To account for SNPs at the boundaries of these
windows, we include SNPs within a buffer around the window in the
computation (e.g. 250 kb on either side). We also account for statistical
noise in estimates at proximal SNPs by adding M to the LD matrix
estimated from the data 2. This procedure is similar to ridge regression
(Hoerl and Kennard, 1970) and can also be interpreted in a Bayesian
context as adding a prior of N(0, M) to the typed SNP coefﬁcients (Hastie
et al., 2001). Accounting for this statistical noise is necessary to eliminate
false-positive associations (see below).

The imputed z—scores (from the conditional Gaussian distribution) can be
viewed as a linear combination of typed z—scores with weights precomputed
from the reference panel. Therefore, the variance of the imputed z—score can be
estimated on the basis of the weights and the LD among typed SNPs. We
estimate the LD structure among typed SNPs using the reference panel as
above (accounting for statistical noise in the reference panel) and normalize
the imputed z—scores such that their theoretical variance under the null is 1 [in a
real scan, the observed variance may be >1 because of polygenic effects (Yang
et al., 201 1)]. The computational time of our approach scales linearly with the
number of windows across the genome and can be further reduced by pre-
computing the inverse 2 for each genotyping array platform at each window,
although special requirement is required for typed SNPs that are removed by
quality control (QC). In particular, matrix inversion should be repeated at
windows where typed SNPs used in the imputation are removed by QC.

If summary LD statistics (pairwise LD among typed SNPs within a
window in GWAS samples) are also available, they can be directly used
to estimate the variance of each imputed z—score (which can be viewed as
a linear combination of typed z—scores). This produces an accurate esti-
mate of the expected variance under the null for the imputed z—scores,
with no need of adjustment for the statistical noise in the reference panel
(ImpG—SummaryLD). This leads to well-calibrated association statistics
under the null with increased power relative to ImpG-Summary.

Association statistics in GWAS. A standard test for association in
GWAS is the normalized difference in frequencies between cases and

controls (z—score 2) deﬁned as Z: W xiii—{:5 where f+ (2") denotes the

frequency in cases (controls), f is the overall frequency and N the number
of samples. This statistic extends to continuous phenotypes by consider-

 

ing [N times the correlation between the vector of genotypes (0,1,2) and

phenotype. In the case of imputed data, this statistic extends by using
genotype dosages in the computation of the correlation of dosages to
phenotype. LD between pairs of SNPs S and S’ induces a correlation
among the observed z—scores at these SNPs, which can be expressed
through the correlation coefﬁcient r(s, 5’) (see Supplementary Note).
Multivariate Gaussian approximation. Similar to other works
(Conneely and Boehnke, 2007; Han et al., 2009; Wen and Stephens,
2010; Zaitlen et al., 2010), we approximate the full distribution of asso-
ciation statistics Z at 11 SNPs in LD using a multivariate Gaussian dis-
tribution with probability density function depending on the mean it and
variance covariance 2. Let the vector Z be partitioned into two compo-
nents Z, and Z,- corresponding with the typed and imputed SNPs, where
Z, is a vector of size m (assuming m SNPs have been typed) and Z,- has
n—m elements. Similarly, we will partition the mean vector and variance—
covariance matrix into (u,, u,)T corresponding to the means at typed
and imputed SNPs, covariances among imputed (2,3,), covariances
among typed and imputed (Em) and covariance among typed data
(21,1). Then the conditional random variable Z,-|Z, follows a Gaussian
distribution with mean uzilzt = u,+2,-,,EZ,1 (Z, — 11,) and variance

2.2 Gaussian imputation of association statistics
(ImpG-Summary)

When estimating the variance—covariance matrix 2, we adopt a window-
ing strategy aimed at decreasing runtime (a smaller matrix needs to be
inverted for each window in the genome) and at reducing statistical noise
that can show distant SNPs to be spuriously correlated. In particular, we
partition the genome into non-overlapping windows of 1Mb (with a
buffer of 250 kb on either side to account for LD at boundaries). For
each window independently, we estimate 2 from the reference panel of
haplotypes, with an adjustment for sampling noise (see below). Let Z, be
the set of observed z—scores restricted to current window. We impute Z,- as
Z,-|, =2,,,2;,1Z,. To speed up computation, we precompute 2;,1 for all
genotyping array platforms. For windows where QC has removed part of
the typed SNPs used in imputation 2;} needs to be reestimated. Because
the window length is ﬁxed across the genome, the overall computational
runtime can be thought of linear in the number of SNPs (when 2;,1 has
been precomputed already).

The imputed z—scores at SNP i Z,-|, can be viewed as a linear combin-
ation of typed z—scores Z, with weights W=2,,,2;,1 precomputed from
the reference panel. Let A denote the variance—covariance matrix among
typed SNPs in the population. Because we assume Z,~N(0, A), it follows
that Z,-|, has variance WA WT. Therefore, we use 2"" as the imputation
z—score at imputed SNP i. To account for the statistical noise, while also
making sure that 2 is invertible we adopt a procedure similar to ridge
regression (Hoerl and Kennard, 1970) and use 2 = Eunadj + M in both 2,,
and 2,, in the estimation of W (we use A = 0.1 as default; see
Supplementary Tables S1—S3 for results across other values of A). We
approximate A with 2,, using LD information from reference panel
(ImpG—Summary).

An alternative is to use the true A, i.e. the summary LD statistics from
the GWAS sample, if they are available; in this case, a more substantial
adjustment for statistical noise in 2 is not needed because A is derived
from the GWAS sample, and we set A=0.001 to make sure that 2 is
invertible in the estimation of W (ImpG—SummaryLD). We do not use
the summary LD statistics across typed SNPs in the sample for estimation
of Win ImpG—SummaryLD, to maintain consistency among pairwise LD
statistics between typed and imputed SNPs. Software implementing the
ImpG—Summary and ImpG—SummaryLD methods has been made pub-
licly available.

We propose a metric for imputation accuracy based on the variance of
the conditional random variable Z,-|Z,: we deﬁne rzpred= 1 — 2,1,.
Supplementary Figure S1 shows that rzpred behaves similarly to the

 

standard imputation accuracy metric rzhat(Li et al., 2010; correlation
of 0.90 to the true r2 accuracy as compared with 0.92 for rzhat).

2.3 Simulation framework

We simulated data starting from the 381 diploid European individuals
from the phase 2 release of the 1000 Genomes Project (June 2011; The
1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012). The 381 individuals include 87
CEPH individuals of North European ancestry, 93 Finnish individuals
from Finland, 89 British individuals from England and Scotland (GBR),
98 Tuscan individuals and 14 individuals from the Iberian peninsula.
Genotype calls and haplotypic phase had been previously inferred from
low-coverage sequencing (4X) using an imputation strategy that bor-
rowed information across samples and loci (The 1000 Genomes Project
Consortium, 2012). The set haplotypes were split at random between a set
of 178 (number chosen to match the 89 samples of British ancestry)
haplotypes used to build simulated data, and the other set was used as
an imputation reference panel. Starting from the simulation panel of
haplotypes, we used HAPGEN (Su et al., 2011) to simulate 10 000 diploid
individuals. All simulation results were generated over 50 distinct 1Mb
regions (total of 50 Mb) randomly chosen across Chromosome 1 totaling
321226 SNPs. For each of the SNPs with MAF >1% in the reference
panel (133 025 in total), we simulated case—control datasets by randomly
choosing a subset of 1000 controls, and then choosing 1000 cases from
the remaining samples so that samples with 02122 reference alleles have
relative probabilities 1: OR: OR2 of being chosen (for a given odds ratio
(0R)). For null simulations, we randomly selected 1000 samples as cases
and 1000 samples as controls.

2.4 Real data

WTCCC dataset. We examined data from the WTCCC phase 1 compris-
ing GWAS studies of seven diseases: Bipolar disorder (BD), Coronary
heart disease (CAD), Crohn’s disease (CD), Hypertension (HT),
Rheumatoid arthritis (RA), Type 1 diabetes (TlD) and Type 2 diabetes
(T2D) (see Supplementary Table S4 for detailed sample sizes; Wellcome
Trust Case Control Consortium, 2007). We removed all SNPs that had
overall deviation from Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium at a P—value below
0.01. Then, we removed any SNP that had differential missigness
(P< 0.01) in any of the case—control cohort, overall missingness >0.001
or minor allele frequency <0.01. This yielded 325 553 SNPs. We per-
formed HMM-based imputation using the prephasing approach of
(Howie et al., 2012); we used HAPI—UR (Williams et al., 2012) to infer
haplotypes from genotypes and then ran IMPUTE2 (Howie et al., 2012)
using default parameters on the inferred haplotypes. Unless otherwise
noted, we ﬁltered out imputed SNPs using an imputation accuracy
cutoff of 0.6, as well as SNPs that had >5% of the individual imputed
calls missing at a posterior probability level of 0.9. This procedure yielded
~4.7 M SNPs for the considered phenotypes (Supplementary Table S4).

1958 Birth Cohort data. The British 1958 birth cohort is an ongoing
follow-up of all persons born in England, Scotland and Wales during 1
week in 1958. At the age of 44—45 years, the cohort was followed up with
a biomedical examination and blood sampling (Strachan et al., 2007),
from which a DNA collection was established as a nationally represen-
tative reference panel (http://www.b58cgene.sgul.ac.uk/). Non-overlap-
ping subsets of the DNA collection were genotyped by the Wellcome
Trust Case—Control Consortium (WTCCC; Wellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium, 2007), the Type 1 Diabetes Genetics Consortium
(T1DGC; Barrett et al., 2009) and the GABRIEL consortium (Moffatt
et al., 2010). Genotyping by the WTCCC used both the Affymetrix 500K
array and the Illumina 550K (version 1) array. Because the T1DGC used
the Illumina 550K (version 3) array and GABRIEL used the Illumina
610K array, a combined dataset was created of SNPs in common across
these three panels. SNPs were excluded from subsequent imputation if
they had MAF <1%, call rate <95%, HWE P< 0.0001 or differences in

allele frequency across the three deposits (P<0.0001 on pairwise
comparisons). Preimputation phasing was performed using Mach (Li
et al., 2010). Imputations against the March 2012 release of 1000-
genomes all-ethnicities reference haplotypes were performed using
Minimac (Howie et al., 2012). Associations of imputed allele dosages
with standing height, as measured at the 44—45-year follow-up, were
analyzed using ProbAbel (Aulchenko et al., 2010).

Publicly available summary statistics for four lipid traits. Publicly avail-
able GWAS summary data across four blood lipids phenotypes (TG, TC,
HDL and LDL) were downloaded from public access Web sites (Teslovich
et al., 2010). These data have been recently used in a study of overlap of
GWAS ﬁndings and functional data (Schork et al., 2013); all QC steps are
described elsewhere (Teslovich et al., 2010). The data comprised roughly
2.7 M summary statistics based on ~100 000 samples for each of the four
phenotypes. To remove strand ambiguity, we removed all A/T and C/G
SNPs (~15 .4% of all SNPs); we also removed all SNPs with meta-analysis
sample sizes under 80000, leaving ~2.0 M SNPs for each of the pheno-
types. We imputed to 1000G using ImpG—Summary under three scenarios.
In the ﬁrst scenario, we removed 10% of the SNPs at random. In the
second scenario, we removed all SNPs not present on the Illumina 610
genotyping platform (~600k in total). In both of these scenarios, we
imputed from the remaining SNPs and assessed accuracy using the previ-
ously masked SNPs. As a metric of accuracy, we computed the correlation
between imputed and previously masked association statistics. In the third
scenario, we imputed from all 2.0 M SNPs to obtain the summary statistics
at 7.3 M SNPs that we publicly release.

Enrichment analysis for four lipid traits. We used an analysis similar to
Schork et al. (2013) to quantify enrichment per classes of SNPs. We
categorized each SNP according to its distance to genes using the all
SNPs track (snp137) (http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi—bin/hgTables). All
SNPs within an exon, up to 5 kb upstream and up to 5 kb downstream,
located in the 3’ UTR or in the 5’ UTR were labeled as genie. SNPs with
no annotation in the data were considered as being Intergenic. For each
dataset, we normalized the association statistics using genomic control
attained only over the Intergenic SNPs (Schork et al., 2013), followed by
computation of average variance across SNPs within each functional
class. We estimate the variance as the average of the squared association
z—scores minus 1 (Schork et al., 2013). We compared the magnitude of
enrichment in association statistics across different functional classes
within the same dataset (either the public data or the imputed one)
using the median of the Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test statistic at 100
random draws each of 10000 random SNPs across the genome. This
conservative computation avoids correlations due to LD and does not
account for the larger number of SNPs in the 1000G imputed data, which
would further increase statistical signiﬁcance.

2.5 Gaussian imputation of individual genotypes

Although we focus primarily on imputation of summary statistics, for
completeness, we also discuss Gaussian imputation when individual-level
data are available. We compare two different approaches. The ﬁrst
approach is to apply ImpG—SummaryLD as described above, relying
only on summary association statistics and summary LD statistics. The
second approach (which attains slightly worse results) is similar to the
approach proposed by Wen and Stephens (2010). As described in that
study, we can impute allele frequencies and treat each genotype as a
sample of size 2. Following Wen and Stephens (2010), we set it to be
the observed allele frequency in the reference panel and 2U, ]] to be the
covariance between SNP i and j. Next, we apply the same windowing
approach above to each sample independently to impute individual-level
genotypes. Although rare, in practice Gaussian imputation can output
values <0 or >2; we adjust these values to 0 and 2, respectively. As as-
sociation statistic, we use the x2 1 df statistic N p2(G’ , (1)), where N is the
number of samples and p2(G’, (1)) is the squared correlation between the
vectors of imputed genotypes and the phenotype.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulations

To explore the effectiveness of Gaussian imputation using sum-
mary statistics (ImpG—Summary and ImpG—SummaryLD), we
simulated case—control datasets at various effect sizes across a
wide range of SNPs (see Section 2). To assess the performance of
imputation at recovering the true association signal when pre-
sent, we used the relative effective sample size, deﬁned as the
ratio of average imputed X2 statistics at untyped SNPs versus
X2 statistics computed from true genotypes. Here X2 statistics
refer to the squared z—score, which has a X2 with 1 df distribution
under the null hypothesis. We envision that real scans will restrict
their analyses to variants with high-estimated imputation accur-
acy [rzpred>0.6, analogous to the rzhat estimator in HMM-
based imputation (Li et al., 2010), Supplementary Fig. S1], but
we computed the relative effective sample size with all values of
rzpred included to provide an appropriate assessment of power.
However, we restricted most of our analyses of false positives to
accurately imputed variants (rzpred > 0.6), as these are the vari-
ants that would be analyzed in a real scan.

We ﬁrst explored the robustness of imputation from summary
statistics. ImpG—Summary attains genomic control AGC of 0.94
(Supplementary Fig. S2), with no increase in false-positive rate at
the tail of the distribution (Supplementary Tables Sl—S3).
Although ImpG—Summary attains a slight deﬂation (because of
the adjustment procedure that has the effect of shrinking the
predictor weights), this is necessary to avoid false positives. As
expected from the conditional distribution, Gaussian imputation
with no variance normalization is deﬂated (AGC = 0.86), while the
naive normalization that does not account for the statistical noise
in the LD matrix is also susceptible to false positives [we observe
a near 4-fold increase in P—values <10_4 as compared with a well-
calibrated statistic in null data simulations (Supplementary
Tables S1 and S2 and Supplementary Fig. S2)]. Similar results
are obtained at different QC thresholds based on rzpred
(Supplementary Table S1). However, when pairwise correlations
among typed SNPs are available from the GWAS data, the
expected variance under null of the imputed statistics can be
accurately estimated and used for normalization (ImpG-
SummaryLD). This removes the need for adjusting the LD
matrix estimated from the reference panel leading to distributed
association statistics with no susceptibility to false positives
(AGC = 1.00, Supplementary Fig. S2).

Recent work in parallel to ours has also investigated the use of
Gaussian models for summary association imputation but do not
propose an adjustment for the statistical noise in the reference
panel (DIST; Lee et al., 2013a). DIST shares many similarities to
the version of our approach that does not perform an adjustment
for the statistical noise in estimating 2. Because we caution that
adjusting for the statistical noise in the reference panel is required
to avoid false positives when using our method (Supplementary
Fig. S2), we investigated whether such an adjustment would also
be needed for DIST. We simulated a null GWAS by randomly
partitioning the 1000G European data, computed z—scores as
above and performed Gaussian imputation of summary statistics
from SNPs present on a standard genotyping array using both
DIST(v0.1.4) and ImpG—Summary (Table 1). We observe that
DIST, which does not adjust for statistical noise in the reference

panel, is susceptible to false positives at these reference panel
sizes (Table l and Supplementary Fig. S3); this is consistent to
simulations for the variant of our approach that does not adjust
2 (Supplementary Fig. S2). Thus, an adjustment is needed to
control the false-positive rate at small reference panel sizes; it is
possible that the adjustment factor could be reduced at larger
reference panel sizes.

We next assessed the ability of ImpG— Summary to identify true-
positive associations by measuring the decrease in effective sample
size. Table 2 shows the relative effective sample size in 1000G
simulations with target and reference haplotypes randomly
sampled from 762 European haplotypes (i.e roughly matched
for ancestry). As a gold standard for imputation accuracy, we
used Beagle, an HMM-based method that requires individual-
level data (Browning and Browning, 2007, 2009). Beagle has pre-
viously been shown to achieve similar accuracy as other HMM-
based methods, with far superior accuracy compared with tag-
ging-based imputation (Browning and Browning, 2009;
Marchini and Howie, 2010b). At an odds ratio of 1.5, ImpG-
Summary recovers 84% (54%) of the effective sample size for
common (>5 %) and low-frequency (1—5%) variants versus 89%
(67%) for Beagle imputation. Interestingly, when LD information
among the typed variants from the GWAS is available, ImpG-
SummaryLD recovers 87% (60%) of the effective sample size,
nearly as high as Beagle. Table 2 also shows the decrease in effect-
ive sample size across a wide array of odds ratios showing that the
results are robust to different effect sizes. Thus, imputation from
summary statistics can recover most of the association power
available from GWAS with individual-level data.

We also tested the effect of a mismatch in ancestry between the
reference haplotype panel and the target population. We simu-
lated case—control GWAS using the GBR haplotypes for target
samples and the remaining 1000G European haplotypes as ref-
erence haplotypes. Table 3 shows only marginal decrease in per-
formance for each of HMM, ImpG—Summary and ImpG-
SummaryLD as compared with previous results, with no excess
of false positives (Supplementary Table S2).

We note that both ImpG—Summary and ImpG-SummaryLD
are computationally very fast, with running times several orders
of magnitude lower than HMM-based methods for imputation
from individual-level genotypes. Table 4 shows a reduction in
running time of several orders of magnitude for ImpG-
Summary as compared with HMM-based approaches. The mag-
nitude of the difference in running time will only increase with
larger studies (such as the N = 100 000 studies analyzed below),
as the running time of ImpG—Summary is independent of the
number of target samples, while the running time of HMM-
based imputation is linear in this quantity. However, we note
that all of the methods listed in Table 4 can be parallelized
across regions of the genome for faster wall-clock running time.

Although our work focuses on imputation from summary stat-
istics, for completeness we also investigate Gaussian imputation
when individual-level data are available. This has been proposed
in (\Nen and Stephens, 2010) and shown to achieve similar ac-
curacy as HMM-based imputation in the context of HapMap 3
data. In simulations from 1000G, we ﬁnd that our implementa-
tion of the (W en and Stephens, 2010) approach (see Section 2)
achieves slightly but signiﬁcantly lower accuracy than ImpG-
SummaryLD (Supplementary Tables S7 and S8) across a wide

range of effect sizes. The slight improvement of
ImpG—SummaryLD over Gaussian imputation using individ-
ual-level genotypes suggests that there is an advantage to pheno-
type-aware imputation. When individual-level genotypes are
available, HMM-based imputation remains the approach of
choice because of its slightly higher accuracy, but we recommend
the use of ImpG—SummaryLD in preference to previous methods
for performing Gaussian imputation when rapidly prioritizing
regions for HMM-based analysis.

WTCCC study spanning seven diseases (\Nellcome Trust Case
Control Consortium, 2007) [roughly 2000 cases for each disease
and 3000 shared controls genotyped on Affymetrix 500K array
(Supplementary Table S4)], and a study of height involving 6500
individuals from the British 1958 birth cohort (1958BC) geno-
typed on the Affymetrix 6.0 array (see Section 2). Starting from
the real genotype data, we used as reference all 758 European
haplotypes of the 1000G phase 2 data to accurately impute ~4.3
million SNPs with minor allele frequency > 1% either using an
HMM-based method [IMPUTE2 with prephasing (Howie et al.,

We compared association statistics at accurately imputed

ual-level data). We observed an average correlation of 0.94 be-

plots show similar behavior for HMM-based association as com-
pared with ImpG—Summary imputation, emphasizing no excess
of false positives when only summary data are used in imput-
ation (Supplementary Figs S5—S13). In some instances, we ob-
serve differences that we hypothesize represent false positives for
the HMM-based imputation, likely because of insufﬁcient QC
ﬁltering for the HMM-based approach (Supplementary Figs
S10—S12). Importantly, statistics at known associated SNPs
from the NHGRI GWAS catalog for each of the considered
phenotypes (Hindorff et al., 2009; Table 5) show similar associ-
ation power across the two compared methods (e.g. an average
X2 of 19.17 for HMM-based imputation versus 18.28 across the
WTCCC data and 4.55 versus 4.76 for the height phenotype;

3.3 Application to publicly available summary statistics
for four lipid traits

We investigated the performance of ImpG—Summary on publicly
available summary association statistic datasets of four blood
lipid traits (Teslovich et al., 2010). These data have been imputed
using HMM-based imputation to an average of 2.0 M markers
(see Section 2). We imputed this data to 7.3 M 1000G markers.

found in Supplementary Figure S13. ImpG—Summary took 4 CPU days
for the 10% data and under 10 CPU h for the array-based imputation

We randomly masked 10% of the data, reimputed using
ImpG—Summary and assessed accuracy by comparing ImpG-
Summary with the masked data. As expected, we observe a
high correlation between the two sets of summary statistics
[correlation r = 0.98 (0.95) at common (low-frequency) variants;
see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Fig. S14]. To quantify the expected
accuracy when imputation is performed from array-based asso-
ciation statistics, we also masked all association statistics not
present on a standard genotyping array and reimputed using
ImpG—Summary. We again observe a high correlation [r = 0.97
(0.91) at common (low-frequency) variants; see Fig. 3 and
Supplementary Fig. S14], thus showing that our approach
recovers association statistics similar to those obtained by
HMM-based imputation requiring individual-level genotypes.
We have publicly released imputed summary association statis-
tics obtained using the full set of 2.0 M markers, without
masking (see Web Resources). As expected, we observed lower
AGC for ImpG-Summary data as compared with original data
(e.g. 0.92 versus 0.98 for HDL phenotype, see Supplementary
Table S9).

3.4 Enrichment analysis for four lipid traits

We categorized each SNP according to functional classes (see
Section 2). We performed genomic control correction using

AGC estimated from only the Intergenic SNPs, as in (Schork
et al., 2013). After normalization, we estimated the average
excess variance for each functional class as the average square
of the association z—score minus 1 (Schork et al., 2013). We ob-
serve that 1000G imputation using ImpG—Summary increases the
average variance for each functional class, with Genie SNPs (and
in some cases, Intronie SNPs) showing larger increases than
Intergenic SNPs (Fig. 4 and Supplementary Fig. S15). The in-
crease in Ame," for each functional class, even after normalization
by AGC, indicates that 1000G imputation increases the ratio
Amean/AGC, i.e. causes true signals to be more concentrated at
the tail of the distribution.

1000G imputation using ImpG—Summary increases statistical
evidence of enrichment at Genie versus Intergenic SNPs, both
because the magnitude of the enrichment is larger and because of
the increased number of SNPs. We focus here on just the former
effect by computing KS test statistics at random subsets of 10 000
SNPs, a conservative computation that avoids correlations be-
cause of LD (see Section 2). Across all four phenotypes, median
KS test statistics were more signiﬁcant in the 1000G imputed
data versus the original dataset (e.g. 4.75E-08 versus 7.63E—05
for HDL; see Supplementary Table S10 for all phenotypes). This
highlights the increased utility of the 1000G imputed summary
statistics that we have publicly released for analyses of functional
enrichment.

4 DISCUSSION

We have introduced an approach for imputation of association
statistics at untyped variants directly from summary association
statistics using publicly available reference panels of haplotypes
such as 1000G (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012),
in contrast to widely used HMM-based approaches that require
individual-level genotypes (Howie et al., 2012). Through exten-
sive simulations and real data analyses, we show that our ap-
proach is almost as powerful as imputation from individual-level
genotypes (for both common and low-frequency variants) with
no excess of false positives. We have described a method that
uses summary association statistics (ImpG—Summary), as well as
a method that uses summary association statistics and summary
LD statistics (ImpG—SummaryLD). Because summary LD stat-
istics are not currently widely shared, we expect that ImpG-
Summary will be of greatest practical value in the immediate
future. However, the slightly higher power attained by ImpG-
SummaryLD provides a motivation for sharing of summary LD
statistics to become a widely accepted practice. This is likely to
also prove valuable in other settings, such as conditional analysis
or rare variant testing (Lee et al., 2013b; Yang et al., 2012).

It is often the case that privacy and logistic constraints pro-
hibit the sharing of individual-level data. On the other hand,
summary association statistics from large-scale association stu-
dies are often readily available (Schork et al., 2013; Teslovich
et al., 2010), despite the fact that privacy concerns may extend
to summary data (Homer et al., 2008; Sankararaman et al.,
2009). For example, a recent study used publicly available sum-
mary association statistics over a wide range of phenotypes to
draw inferences about the enrichment of disease-associated
variants in several functional categories (Schork et al., 2013).
Using the methods introduced here, such analyses can be

difference between original data and 1000G imputed association statistics

expanded to the set of all 1000G variants. In particular, we have
publicly released imputed association statistics at 1000G variants
for four lipid traits. We show that for these four lipid traits,
1000G imputed summary statistics show a consistently larger
and more statistically signiﬁcant signal of enrichment in genie
versus non-genie regions as compared with the original publicly
available data. Thus, 1000G imputed summary statistics can be
used to increase power in studies of functional enrichment.

The Gaussian approximation for LD among SNPs has previ-
ously been used in a wide range of problems (Conneely and
Boehnke, 2007; Han et al., 2009; McPeek, 2012; Wen and
Stephens, 2010; Zaitlen et al., 2010). We showed that an adjust-
ment similar to ridge regression removed the false-positive
associations in imputed summary statistics that occurred when
unadjusted estimates of LD were used. As reference panels
become larger, we expect a smaller adjustment factor to be
needed, thus increasing accuracy. Large reference panels of
typed SNPs could potentially also be used to reduce the adjust-
ment factor needed for avoiding false positives (Yang et al.,
2012). Other recent works have proposed to reduce the compu-
tational burden of imputation using a technique similar to matrix
completion; however, that approach does not extend to imput-
ation from summary statistics (Chi et al., 2013).

Our proposed procedure relies on accurate estimates of pair-
wise LD that match the population of the GWAS sample, in
contrast to HMM-based approaches that use cosmopolitan
reference panels that include all available haplotype data
(Howie et al., 2012). Our method is directly applicable to
admixed populations such as African Americans and Latino
Americans for which 1000G reference panels are currently avail-
able (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012), but is not
applicable to samples of uncertain ethnicity or samples for which
reference panels are not available.

The method proposed here relies on a windowing approach to
reduce the number of pairwise LD parameters to be estimated
from the reference panels. Although this procedure reduces dra-
matically the number of pairwise LD parameters, our choice of
window size (1 cM) may still allow for overestimation of pairwise
LD because of ﬁnite reference panel sizes. Recent work has
shown that population genetic principles can be used to derive
shrinkage factors based on recombination maps and reference

panel sizes (\Nen and Stephens, 2010). A potentially fruitful
direction for future work is to combine such derivations with
window-based approaches to increase accuracy.

The work of Wen and Stephens (2010) presented methods for
Gaussian imputation from allele frequencies in cases and con-
trols or from individual-level genotypes. There are many key
differences between that work and this study. First, we impute
association statistics (i.e. z—scores) rather than allele frequencies.
For case—control traits, it is unclear how to use imputed allele
frequencies in cases and controls (\Nen and Stephens, 2010) to
obtain association statistics that are robust to false positives; for
quantitative traits, imputation of allele frequencies does not
apply. Thus, the methods and software of Wen and Stephens
(2010) cannot be used to impute association statistics, as we
have done here. Second, we evaluate our approach in simulations
based on 1000G data (The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2012), assessing both power and false-positive associations.
Third, we validate our approach using real empirical data
across several GWAS involving both discrete and continuous
phenotypes, including the four lipid traits for which we have
publicly released imputed association statistics at 1000G
variants. We note that recent parallel work has also proposed
to use summary statistics with reference panels of haplotypes for
imputation [(Lee et al., 2013a); a related approach is proposed in
(Hu et al., 2013)], but that work does not provide a strategy to
address false-positive associations arising from the limited size of
the reference panel, as we do here.

We conclude with several limitations for the approaches we
presented here. First, when summary LD statistics from the
study are not available, our adjustment procedure leads to a
slight deﬂation of association statistics under null data. This
could hamper efforts to assess confounding because of popula-
tion stratiﬁcation or cryptic relatedness via genomic control
(Devlin and Roeder, 1999). However, it is now widely recognized
that genomic control is not an effective approach for assessing
confounding in large studies, because of the expected inﬂation
from polygenic effects (Yang et al., 2011). Second, application of
our approach to summary statistics with inappropriate levels of
QC is a potential concern because of the possibility of introdu-
cing false positives. Therefore, we caution that appropriate QC
should be performed on typed variants before estimation of

summary association statistics, as is standard procedure in any
GWAS. Third, recent work has shown that low-coverage sequen-
cing is a more powerful alternative to genotyping arrays per unit
of cost invested (Flannick et al., 2012; Li et al., 2011; Nielsen
et al., 2011; Pasaniuc et al., 2012). The extension of Gaussian
imputation to low-coverage sequencing data remains a direction
for future work. Finally, as with all imputation approaches, the
methods presented here are more accurate for common variants
than for low-frequency variants. Accuracy will be even lower at
rare variants, although GWAS involving single-variant associ-
ations are generally focused on common and low-frequency
variants.

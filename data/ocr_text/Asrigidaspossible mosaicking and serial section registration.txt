ABSTRACT

Motivation: Tiled serial section Transmission Electron Microscopy
(ssTEM) is increasingly used to describe high-resolution anatomy
of large biological specimens. In particular in neurobiology, TEM
is indispensable for analysis of synaptic connectivity in the brain.
Registration of ssTEM image mosaics has to recover the 3D
continuity and geometrical properties of the specimen in presence
of various distortions that are applied to the tissue during sectioning,
staining and imaging. These include staining artifacts, mechanical
deformation, missing sections and the fact that structures may
appear dissimilar in consecutive sections.

Results: We developed a fully automatic, non-rigid but as-rigid-as-
possible registration method for large tiled serial section microscopy
stacks. We use the Scale Invariant Feature Transform (SIFT) to
identify corresponding landmarks within and across sections and
globally optimize the pose of all tiles in terms of least square
displacement of these landmark correspondences. We evaluate the
precision of the approach using an artificially generated dataset
designed to mimic the properties of TEM data. We demonstrate
the performance of our method by registering an ssTEM dataset of
the first instar larval brain of Drosophila melanogaster consisting of
6885 images.

Availability: This method is implemented as part of the open source
software TrakEM2 (http://www.ini.uzh.ch/~acardona/trakem2.html)
and distributed through the Fiji project (http://pacific.mpi-cbg.de).

1 INTRODUCTION

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) offers currently the
highest available resolution to investigate the structure of biological
samples. The superior resolution of TEM is classically used to reveal
subcellular structures such as organelles and some of the largest
macromolecular assemblies inside cells. For anatomical studies on
the tissue level, TEM ﬁnds most applications in neurobiology to
reveal neuronal connectivity maps that underlie the function of
the nervous system. The reconstruction of the complete neuronal
connectivity map in Caenorhabditis elegans remains the pinnacle of
these studies (White et al., 1986). On the nanometer scales, brains are
gigantic structures and many overlapping images must be assembled
as a mosaic to cover a substantial portion of the tissue. Moreover,
serial sectioning is required to capture the volume of the specimen
(Fig. la—d).

Digital imaging and high—precision beam or specimen shifting
equipment (Suloway et al., 2005) simpliﬁes the reconstruction of

mosaics within one section by providing a good initial estimate
of the tile conﬁguration (Fig. lb). However, due to the minute
distances involved the precision of the instruments is insufﬁcient
for seamless stitching of the tiles (Fig. 1c). Adjacent sections are
rotated and translated arbitrarily with respect to each other (Fig. 1d).
Physical sectioning, the subsequent manipulation of the sections by
contrast gaining staining procedures and imaging with the electron
beam introduce signiﬁcant distortions and artifacts into the captured
images (Fig. le—h). The goal in reconstruction of serial section
TEM (ssTEM) data is to identify the conﬁguration of all tiles that
best preserves both the continuity and geometry of 3D structures in
the specimen making it amenable for subsequent segmentation and
analysis. Particularly in neurobiology, it is important to preserve
the continuity of axons across large distances and the ability to
distinguish and localize synaptic connections between neurons.

Anderson et al. (2009) propose a registration pipeline for large
ssTEM datasets based on correlation of image intensities within
and across sections. They are able to identify overlapping tiles
in unordered sets automatically, mosaic them by propagating
pairwise translation and reﬁne this initial layout by warping each
tile to its preceding partners. The resulting section mosaics are
registered relative to each other by searching a rigid transformation
initially and subsequently warping one section to the other. This
solution guarantees continuity of 3D structures by maximizing
the overlap of similar image content in adjacent sections. On the
other hand, it cannot preserve geometrical properties because the
unavoidable registration error is accumulated with each consecutive
registration step.

Instead of using all image intensities, it is possible to register
two or more images using corresponding salient points as a statistic
about the image content as proposed by Brown and Lowe (2003)
for panorama stitching. Reducing the problem from full resolution
image content to a relatively small number of corresponding points
simpliﬁes the estimation of the globally optimal conﬁguration for a
large number of tiles.

State of the art techniques (Bay et al., 2008; Lowe, 2004; Matas
et al., 2002; Mikolajczyk and Schmid, 2004; Tuytelaars and Van
G00], 2004) allow both automatic detection of interest points and
extraction of afﬁne invariant local descriptors for these points.
Afﬁne invariant matching becomes nearest neighbor search in a local
feature descriptor space. It was shown by Mikolajczyk and Schmid
(2003) that the local descriptor as used in the Scale Invariant Feature
Transform (SIFT; Lowe, 2004) outperforms competing techniques
in both distinctiveness and robustness with respect to signiﬁcant
image deformation and other disturbing artifacts.

In this article, we present a fully automatic registration method
for large ssTEM image mosaics that globally minimizes the

registration error. We identify overlapping images by corresponding
image content within and across sections using SIFT features and
a geometric consistency constraint. We approximate the non—linear
transformation between adjacent sections by an independent rigid-
body transformation (rotation and translation) for each image tile of
the section mosaics. In a TEM section series, none of the sections
can be considered non-deformed and thus, no section can serve as
a template for registration. Therefore, we deﬁne the registration
problem to be template free and, instead, explicitly minimize the
non—rigid deformation applied to all sections. This is achieved by
globally minimizing the square displacement of all corresponding
SIFT landmarks within and across sections. By this means, the
resulting tile conﬁguration is non-rigid but as-rigid-as-possible. In
order to evaluate the performance of this approach, we developed
a synthetic ground truth dataset that is designed to mimic the
properties of ssTEM data. We were able to register 6885 images
from 85 serial sections through the Drosophila ﬁrst instar larval
brain; each section consisting of 9 X 9 tiles of 2048 X 2048 px. The
registered dataset serves as a starting point for characterizing the
ﬁne architecture of this large brain at unprecedented resolution.

2 METHODS
2.1 Deﬁnition of the task

Specimens prepared for serial sectioning are typically embedded in a block
of rigid medium such as resin, plastic or ice. Using a microtome, ultrathin
consecutive slices are cut from the rigidly mounted block. The slices ﬂoat on
the surface of a liquid in the ‘knife boat’ and are manually picked up onto a
TEM grid. While the section thickness may vary slightly within and across
sections, in this work, we consider sections to be planar and of constant

thickness. In reality, the cross—section variation can be minimized by careful
operation of the microtome, and, as both the specimen itself and the knife
of the microtome are rigidly mounted, intrasection variation is compensated
throughout the section series by complementary variation in other sections.

Each section is imaged as a set of overlapping tiles. For each tile t,
the microscope registers a 2D translation vector tt=(a,v)T in a relative
section reference frame IRE, whereas the section index s is given by the
human operator. These coordinates are inaccurate due to measurement errors
6t 2 (a, v)T (Fig. lb and c). A section’s pose relative to its adjacent sections
is an unknown rigid transformation Rs (Fig. 1d). Moreover, sectioning,
preparation after sectioning and even the imaging process itself induce
noticeable deformations of both sections as a whole (Ds) as well as on the
scale of single tiles (Dt) (Fig. la and e—h).

Therefore, the task is to reconstruct a 3D image volume from serial
sections that have to be reconstructed from single tiles while compensating
for noticeable deformation within and across sections. Particularly, the
deformation—compensation poses the question how to invert the largely
unknown transforming process that mapped a 3D coordinate (x,y,z)T in
scene space IR; into a 2D coordinate (a,v)T in tile space R3. Assuming
planar sections of constant thickness as mentioned above, we attach scene
and section spaces by a permutation st between the scene dimension z and
section index s. Now this mapping shows as

x
it
(V)=RsDtDsts )7 +tt+9t (1)

with RSDtDS and (x, y,z)T being unknown. Without precise knowledge
about the deforming process DtDs, the appropriate solution is that with
minimal non—rigid deformation for all sections, a model being as—rigid—
as—possible. This coincides with the researcher’s request not to introduce
unmotivated artiﬁcial deformation to the image data that would adulterate

RSDtDS +tt by a rigid—per—tile transformation R such that

with cut being the transformation error introduced by the approximation.
Maximal consistency relative to the scene is guaranteed by minimizing the
remaining error 6t 2 wt +6t.

Without knowing the scene, it is impossible to estimate 6t directly.
However, consistency with respect to the scene implies consistency relative
to overlapping tiles. Let T be the set of all tiles te T and R be the set of all
rigid transformations R, e R, then the best conﬁguration R is that minimizing
the sum of all relative transfer errors of pairwise overlapping tiles:

Using landmark correspondences as a statistic about corresponding image
content, cm is the sum of all square correspondence point displacements. Let
Cm be a set of landmark correspondences (x, y) between two tiles te T and
o e T \ {t} with x e t and y e 0, then the best conﬁguration R is that minimizing
the sum of all square correspondence displacements:

argngn Z Z Z IIRtx—Royn2 (4)

t€T\{f} 0€T\{t} (Xay)€Ct0

with f e T being a ﬁxed tile that deﬁnes the scene reference frame. All tiles
must represent one single interconnected graph being pairwise connected by
sets of landmark correspondences.

This optimization task requires a reliable landmark correspondence
detector. Within a section, the appropriate interest point detector needs to
be covariant to translation and robust against small amounts of non—rigid
deformation as the overlapping parts of two consecutive tiles show the
projection of the same tissue slightly deformed by heat during imaging.
For cross—section matching, the appropriate interest point detector needs
covariance to rotation as well as an automatism to detect only structures
that appear similar, since two adjacent tiles show different portions of the
tissue and are related by a rigid transformation and some plastic deformation.
In ssTEM data, depending on section thickness, corresponding locations
can be identiﬁed by local appearance of large enough structures sectioned
perpendicularly. Such structures appear on different scales (for instance,

mitochondria 500 nm, nuclei 2um and neuropile compartments 40 um) and
thus detecting structures with large (x, y)T—scale raises the chance to detect
the same structures in adjacent sections (Fig. 2).

For its scale invariant nature and robustness, we decided to use
SIFT (Lowe, 2004) for both intra— and intersection landmark correspondence
detection.

2.2 SIFT

SIFT (Lowe, 2004) detects blobs of arbitrary size as interest points using
the Diﬁ‘erence of Gaussian detector, estimates one or more dominant
orientations for each detection and extracts a scale and orientation invariant
local descriptor for each. Such blob—like structures are common in most
textured images including TEM data. Typically, we detect several hundreds
to thousands of interest points in a TEM micrograph of 2000 x 2000px
image size.

The detection’s size, orientation and 2D location deﬁne a local coordinate
frame for extraction of an invariant descriptor. We found empirically, that
a larger descriptor built from 8 x 8 local histograms with eight bins each
(512 dimensions) provides substantially better matching results for our data
than the originally proposed 4 x 4 x 8 descriptor. The smaller descriptors
were proposed for natural images where viewpoint change and occlusion
play a signiﬁcant role. In TEM data, where two regions are related only
by a rigid transformation with some deformation, a larger descriptor region
necessarily increases the distinctiveness (Fig. 3).

Interest point correspondence candidates are identiﬁed by nearest
neighbor matching in the local descriptor space. As suggested by Lowe
(2004), good candidates are those that are signiﬁcantly better than the
next nearest neighbor. Signiﬁcantly better means that the ratio between the
Euclidean distances to the nearest and the next nearest neighbor is smaller
than a given threshold. Empirically, we identiﬁed a threshold of 0.92 for
TEM images to yield a reasonable number of correspondence candidates.
Since real—time performance is not required, we identify the exact nearest
neighbor by exhaustive search.

Local descriptor matching results in a signiﬁcant number of false
correspondences. We use the Random Sample Consensus (RANSAC)
(Fischler and Bolles, 1981) to separate true correspondences that behave
consistently with respect to a rigid transformation up to a maximal
correspondence displacement emax (see Algorithm 1). For estimation of
the optimal rigid transformation by means of least square correspondence
displacement, we use the closed form solution described by Schaefer
et al. (2006). Signiﬁcant deformation requires emax to be relatively
tolerant thus accepting some false correspondences. We ﬁlter these with
a robust regression scheme that iteratively removes correspondences with

2.3 Global optimization of the tile conﬁguration

Having the set of true landmark correspondences identiﬁed successfully,
the optimal conﬁguration R of all tiles has to be estimated. As shown in
Equation (4), this is the conﬁguration with minimal square correspondence
displacements.

We minimize this term using an iterative optimization scheme (see
Algorithm 2). In case that prior knowledge about the gross conﬁguration of
all tiles is available, the minimization is initialized with this conﬁguration.
Otherwise all tiles start from R, = I. In each iteration i, the optimal R, for each
single tile te T \ {f} relative to the current conﬁguration is estimated using
the closed form least square solution by Schaefer et al. (2006) and applied to
all landmark coordinates in this tile. The scheme terminates on convergence
of the average correspondence displacement Em that is estimated after each
iteration. As convergence criteria, we require Em to have a low absolute
slope |VhERi| and an absolute value below some threshold given by the user.
It is crucial to prevent being trapped in local minima or at long plateaus. We
address this effectively by requiring th ERl-l to be very low for all h from a set
of decreasing lengths. The maximal length h of a plateau or local valley, the
maximal total number of iterations and the maximal accepted remaining error
are user—deﬁned parameters with empirically estimated defaults suggested.

2.4 Notes on implementation

The described registration algorithm including SIFT, RANSAC, closed form
least square error solutions for a variety of transformation models, the robust
regression scheme and the iterative optimizer are implemented using the Java
programming language and provided as an Open Source library through the
ImageJ distribution Fiji (Schindelin, 2008). The registration procedure is
included in the software toolkit TrakEM2 (Cardona, 2006) for management,
registration and analysis of massive serial section microscopy datasets and,
by that, in daily use in a large number of laboratories allover the world.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Overview of the registration algorithm

Principally, the registration procedure consists of extracting
landmarks from all tiles, identifying landmark correspondences
between tile pairs and estimating the tile conﬁguration that
minimizes the sum of all square correspondence displacements as
shown in Algorithm 3.

Practically, since adjacent sections are related by a rigid
transformation Rs plus some non-rigid deformation Ds that is
to be compensated, we would like to use the transformation Rs
as initialization for the sought after conﬁguration R and as a
hint which tiles to exclude from pairwise feature comparison.
Unfortunately, single sections do not always represent a single
landmark—interconnected graph of tiles, while the whole volume
eventually does. This is a typical scenario when imaging tree—like
structures and the operator following only the branches ignoring
the rest of the volume. That is, instead of the section as a whole,
all graphs of a section have to be tested against all graphs present
in the previous section. Two graphs that can be registered to each
other are then joined into a single one by matching and ﬁltering
the features of overlapping tiles. Eventually, this will result in
one single graph representing the whole volume. After joining
two graphs, the conﬁguration of the resulting graph is optimized

thus sequentially building up the optimal global conﬁguration from
optimal intermediate conﬁgurations.

We applied this registration approach to test sets of TEM data of
the Drosophila ﬁrst instar larval brain sectioned into 60 nm sections
imaged at 3.26 nm/px resolution. We developed a visualization
of the global optimization progress where for each iteration the
corresponding landmarks and the residual transfer error between
them are highlighted by green dots and red lines, respectively.
Movie 1 available as supplementary on-line material shows the
progress of the optimization for a single section dataset consisting
of 6 X 6 tiles.1 It highlights the ability of the method to correctly
place even tiles that contain mostly background (lower left corner
tile) and gain very little SIFT feature detections, as long as these are
attached to the graph. If a tile lacks SIFT correspondences altogether,
it represents an independent graph on its own. The user can choose to
drop or hide all but the largest graph from the dataset. Movie 2 shows
the progress of the optimization on three serial sections imaged as
4 X 4 tile mosaics demonstrating that the procedure for multiple
section is essentially the same as for a single section.2

3.2 Quantitative assessment of registration results on
synthetic evaluation data

We created an artiﬁcial dataset with the ray-tracing program
POV—ray (Cason et al., 2007) that allows to deﬁne the interior of
a volume as a density pattern based on an arbitrary volumetric
function, where high density scatters more light than low density
(Fig. 4).3 This simulates the imaging process in the Transmission
Electron Microscope where structures with a higher density of
heavy-metal atoms scatter more electrons than structures with lower
density and appear darker at the screen. The interior of the evaluation
dataset contains ﬁlamentous and ‘blob’-like structures, both over
three scale octaves with multiscale turbulence. In this way, it mimics
typical structures in the stained tissue, like membranes, nucleoli and
mitochondria.

To emulate the ssTEM data we generated 16 projections
of 4096 X 4096px each through consecutive volumes of 20px

thickness, which is roughly equivalent to the ratio of x,y versus
z resolution in typical TEM data. We split the synthetic ground
truth data into 1024 X 1024px tiles with 102px overlap resulting
in 25 images per section. We ran our registration program on the
resulting 400 images as if there was nothing known about the tiles
poses other than the section index. The registration results in a stack
that is anchored to a randomly selected tile in the world reference
frame. Thus, missing comparable world coordinates, we evaluate the
quality of the registration by estimating the coordinate translation
that gives the minimal average displacement when applied to the
registered stack. This identiﬁes the world reference frame of the
registered stack and gives an average registration error of a pixel
relative to the original scene.

We select a random sample of 1000 locations in each tile and
transfer all locations into the world reference frame using the true
and the registered transformation model of the tile. The translation
between registration and ground truth domain is that between the
centroids of both point clouds. The average residual transfer error
serves as a quantitative measure of the registration process. We
estimated an average displacement E = 4.14 px, SD 06 = 3.63 px and
maximal displacement emax = 15.71 px for the registration result.
These results demonstrate that, with the proposed method, we can
both identify overlap in an unknown conﬁguration of images and
register them.

3.3 Registration of the Drosophila ﬁrst instar larval
brain ssTEM dataset

As an example of real biological data, we registered the Drosophila
ﬁrst instar larval brain ssTEM dataset consisting of 85 sections of
60 nm thickness covering lateral neuronal layers and part of the
neuropile of the left hemisphere. Each section was imaged with
TEM using a moving stage operated by the Leginon software as
9 X 9 tiles overlapping by ~6%. Tiles have a size of 2048 X 2048 px
and a resolution of 4.68 nm/px. All 6885 tiles were registered fully

automatically. Intrasection conﬁgurations were initialized with the
odometry data of the microscope. Correspondence estimation using
SIFT descriptors and robust geometric consensus ﬁlters performed
very well even in presence of signiﬁcant changes in illumination
and sharpness, dirty sections and signiﬁcant gaps of up to six
sections in the stack. Visual inspection of the registered data shows
reliable continuity of biologically relevant structures such as axon
bundles within and across sections both at low and high scales
(Fig. 5a and b).4 Moreover, when the registered dataset is cut
perpendicularly, the resulting image, whose lateral resolution is
limited by section thickness, resembles electron microscopy data
without major discontinuities suggesting that the registration was
successful (Fig. 5c).5 For visualization and collaborative annotation,
we present the registered dataset on—line through the CATMAID web
interface (Saalfeld et al., 2009).6

4 DISCUSSION

We presented a fully automated method for registration of
large ssTEM image mosaics. The method identiﬁes the optimal
conﬁguration of image tiles regardless whether or not an initial guess
of the conﬁguration is available. It is capable of correctly placing
tiles with only minimal image content provided that this content is
connected to the rest of the tile graph. Disconnected graphs of tiles
are registered independently. Thus, the approach is ideally suited
for alignment of ssTEM data generated either manually or using a
robotic setup.

We use SIFT to identify corresponding landmarks and use them
as a statistical sample for similar image content in the TEM
images. The scale invariance of SIFT is well suited to capture the
changing appearance of small structures at low scale levels and the
presence of meaningful similar features at multiple scales. Larger,
more distinctive local descriptors together with the requirement that
correspondence candidates must be geometrically consistent yields
reliably large sets of true matches.

The reduction of the registration task to a compact set of
corresponding landmarks enables global minimization of square
correspondence displacements for very large tile systems. Regis—
tering the 6885 tiles Drosophila larval brain dataset took ~24h
on an Intel® Xeon® computer with two 2.66 GHz dual—core—CPUs
and 8 GB of RAM, with the most time—consuming operation in the
procedure being the exhaustive nearest neighbor search in the 512 D
local descriptor space. Principally, there is no upper limit to the size
of the dataset other than the available storage space.

The described methods for robust outlier removal and global
optimization are applicable to a wide variety of microscopy
image mosaicking tasks. We used it successfully to register light
microscopy image mosaics including sets of overlapping 3D
confocal image stacks (Preibisch et al., 2009b) and applied it to
bead—based registration of Selective Plane Illumination Microscopy
(SPIM; Huisken et al., 2004) datasets consisting of 3D stacks of the
same specimen taken from different angles (Preibisch et al., 2009a).
In Preibisch et al. (2009b), we identify the pairwise 3D translation
between overlapping confocal image stacks by normalized cross—
correlation and globally minimize the translational offset of large

ssTEM registration

 

sets of overlapping stacks. In Preibisch et al. (2009a), we proposed
the usage of ﬂuorescent beads embedded in the rigid mounting
medium as ﬁduciary markers. We use the local constellations
of neighboring beads to automatically identify correspondences
invariantly to 3D rotation and scale. The model for the geometric
consistency constraint and global minimization of the square transfer
errors is a 3D afﬁne transformation with one of the 3D stacks serving
as a template.

We generated a unique evaluation dataset designed to resemble
the appearance of biological tissue in ssTEM data for quantitative
comparison of the registration results. The evaluation framework can
be used to assess the performance of any registration scheme that
records its transformation model and could become the standard
for objectively measuring the performance of various registration
approaches. In future work, we will induce artiﬁcial deformation
and variance in section thickness to the dataset in order to examine
the limits of our registration method. As an alternative more realistic
ground truth evaluation dataset, we propose to use Serial Block-Face
Scanning Electron Microscopy data (Denk and Horstmann, 2004)
where consecutive sections are aligned per deﬁnition.

The presented registration method is non—rigid but as—rigid—as—
possible with a tile being the unit of rigidity for intrasection
alignment. This delivers an ssTEM image dataset amenable to
quantitative analysis, such as double dissector estimation of synaptic
density (Geinisman et al., 1996), which require volumes to be as
reliable as possible. On the other hand, rigid—per—tile registration
cannot compensate large—scale deformation by tile displacement
without introducing noticeable discontinuities at the tile borders.
The solution to this problem lies in extending the approach to
include arbitrary non—rigid deformation at scales below the tile level
preserving the regularization in terms of local rigidity. That means
deforming all images minimally. We are currently exploring various
ideas of how to express this regularization for a completely non—
rigid global registration. The evaluation dataset will be instrumental
in assessing the performance of such approaches with respect to
reﬂecting faithfully the ground truth data.

The globally optimal reconstruction of entire brains on TEM level
will enable registration of 3D light microscopy data onto electron
microscopy volumes. By that it will be possible to establish the
connection between brain macro (neuronal lineages) and micro
(synaptic connectivity) circuitry (Cardona et al., 2009).

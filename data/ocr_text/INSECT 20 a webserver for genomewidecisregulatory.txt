Abstract

INSECT is a user-friendly web server to predict the occurrence of Cis—Regulatory Modules (CRMs),
which control gene expression. Here, we present a new release of INSECT which includes several
new features, such as whole genome analysis, nucleosome occupancy predictions, and which pro-
vides additional links to third-party functional tools that complement user capabilities, CRM ana-
lysis and hypothesis construction. Improvements in the core implementation have led to a faster
and more efficient tool. In addition, this new release introduces a new interface designed for a

more integrative and dynamic user experience.

1 Introduction

The complexity of multicellular organisms is principally a product
of the intricate regulatory networks through which they control cell
expression, in a range of spatiotemporal conditions. The high speci-
ficity required for gene expression regulation is acquired mainly
through the physical interaction of many Transcription Factors
(TFs) that bind to groups of cis DNA elements (Transcription Factor
Binding Sites, TFBSs) in a coordinated manner. These elements are
often located close to each other and follow specific and highly con-
served patterns, generally known as Cz's-Regulatory Modules
(CRMs).

Mathematical models of many TFBSs have been obtained and
incorporated into publicly available databases. These models, usu-
ally represented as Position Weight Matrices (PWMs), can be used
to predict new instances of regulatory sites over specific sets of se-
quences. However, the major obstacle for prediction of TFBSs,
when aligning PWMs to gene regulatory sequences, is the vast
amount of artifactual findings due to random and non-functional
sites with high PWM scores (i.e. false positives).

INSECT first version (Rohr et al., 2013) was presented as a
CRM detector that outperforms most of the available tools with
similar characteristics in terms of sensitivity and specificity, by the
implementation of several strategies to lower the rate of false posi-
tives. The main advantage of our method is a more realistic semantic
representation of CRMs structures. INSECT offers several features
that allow users to easily extract information related to the genes of
interest from the Ensembl annotations and other third-party tools,
such as the UCSC Genome Browser. The tool interface minimizes
usage complexity, allowing a highly integrative analysis to be
performed.

INSECT 2.0 is significantly faster than its previous version,
allowing for genome-wide analysis. New third-party tools have been
included to help in the processes of further analysis and finding of
CRMs, which can maximize the likelihood of representing true regu-
latory elements. INSECT 2.0 is a new online tool of great value to
every researcher interested to predict the occurrence of CRMs at
genome level and over long lists of genes, with no requirement to in-
stall prior infrastructure.

2 New features

Increased speed

A redesigned search core and data architecture have significantly
boosted search speed. While the previous version was relatively fast
when analyzing several hundred genes, INSECT 2.0 can perform
genome-wide analysis in the same amount of time or faster, depend-
ing on the structure complexity of the CRMs and stringency
parameters.

Genome-wide analysis and improved

results dissection

Genome-wide analysis can be performed for 14 genomes from
Ensembl. By simply defining distance limits relative to the TSS of
each gene, INSECT 2.0 automatically retrieves the corresponding se-
quences and performs the search, providing several genomic annota-
tions and links to third-party tools along with the results.

It has been shown that transcriptional regulation constrains the
organization of genes across and within chromosomes (Janga et al.,
2008). For this reason, INSECT 2.0 allows CRM searches on spe-
cific chromosomes, and the filtering of the resulting lists of genes by
chromosome, when genome-wide analyses are performed.

The protein-coding genes-centric vision for gene expression regu-
lation has until now underestimated the importance of many other
gene categories present in genomes. Non-protein-coding genes are
critically involved in the regulation of cellular processes, and have
been proven to be as tightly regulated as protein-coding genes, as re-
cently demonstrated for lnc-RNA genes (Alam et al., 2014). In add-
ition, the implementation of a biotype filter provides the capability
to perform analyses that are focused on non-protein—coding genes.

Chromatin structure and nucleosomes positioning within DNA
may play a major role in allowing TFs—DNA interaction to proceed
with transcriptional regulation. While high nucleosomes occupancy
in DNA mainly acts as a barrier for most TFs to target the DNA,
some others, called pioneer factors, may be biased to target silent
chromatin and initiate cell-fate changes (Soufi et al., 2015). We have
included a new feature for nucleosomes occupancy calculations for
CRMs (Kaplan et al., 2009), offering more accurate estimation of
whether the predicted site is a real regulatory element or not.

Additional PWM libraries

For users that do not have their own PWM for their TFs of interest,
having a database of known PWMs is essential. In this new release,
we have added several PWMs from Hocomoco (655 PWMs)
(Kulakovskiy et al., 2013), SwissRegulon (189 PWMs) (Pachkov
et al., 2013) and FlyFactorSurvey (486 PWMs) (Zhu et al., 2011).
Taking into consideration those already included in our previous
version, INSECT 2.0 has currently 2526 PWMs integrated in its
PWM database.

Summary statistics and filters

Genomic CRMs search analysis could yield long lists of genes with
several CRM hits on each of them. For this reason, we have imple-
mented visualizations and filters that help to dissect and explore the
search results.

TFs bind to specific elements at the regulatory regions of genes
following certain patterns. Some TFBSs are distributed very close to
the TSS of the target genes, while others show a decreased presence
at those regions, shifting their occurrence to further regions (Chen
et al., 2015). The distribution of distances of the predicted CRMs
relative to the TSS for each gene and the PWM score for each TFBSs

in the CRMs are calculated and visualized as histograms in the re-
sults page, in order to give the user additional information about the
resulting binding patterns.

Dynamic filters for both TSS-relative distances and PWM scores
are implemented. By adjusting these filters, results can be filtered on
the ﬂy, avoiding the need to run the job again with different param-
eters. This dynamism helps users to better handle the results and ob-
tain as much information as possible by progressively changing
search rules from ﬂexible to more strict conditions, in order to iden-
tify those candidate genes with the most reliable CRM predictions.

Additional interaction with third-party tools

Prediction of CRMs is a difficult task given the amount of false posi-
tives that can arise during its search and evaluation. Despite PWMs
being a useful representation of TFBSs, cells have several levels of
complexity that account for transcriptional regulation beyond the
occurrence of representative sites in the DNA. For this reason and to
improve the working hypothesis, we have integrated several external
tools to provide additional biological features about the genes that
are predicted to contain potential CRMs. INSECT 2.0 is linked to
GeneMANIA (Mostafavi et al., 2008), enabling users to select genes
with predicted CRMs to inspect whether or not they are related, ac-
cording to available bibliography. Furthermore, we have included a
link to the Ensembl Regulatory Build (Zerbino et al., 2015), which
aims to annotate regulatory elements in human and mouse genomes,
by merging both experimental and computational derived data.

3 Conclusion

INSECT 2.0 is a powerful tool for researchers requiring search and
analysis capabilities for potential CRMs presence at a genomic scale.
This new release has added several features to help users further ex-
plore predicted CRMs based on the biological aspects of genome
structure. The implementation of search filters reduces the search
space to specific sets of genes of interest, minimizing the rate of false
positives. New visualizations and statistical histograms of the global
results have also been included. By linking the genes with predicted
CRMs to additional third-party resources such as the UCSC
Genome Browser, GeneMANIA or Ensembl Regulation, the power-
ful functionalities of its interface make INSECT 2.0 a unique inte-
grative platform for CRMs prediction. The combined feature set
allows users to exploit CRMs information that otherwise may re-
main hidden in huge tables, or that would require programming,
data gathering or computational skills which would be barriers for
non-specialized users.

ABSTRACT

Summary: In plants, many trans-acting small interfering RNA (ta-
siRNA) regulatory pathways have been identified as significant com-
ponents of the gene networks involved in development, metabolism,
responses to biotic and abiotic stresses and DNA methylation at the
TAS locus. To obtain a more comprehensive understanding on the
nature of ta—siRNA regulatory pathways, we developed a freely ac-
cessible resource, tasiRNAdb, to serve as a repository for the se-
quences of ta—siRNA regulatory pathway-related microRNAs, TASs,
ta—siRNAs and ta—siRNA targets, and for the cascading relations
among them. With 583 pathways from 18 species, tasiRNAdb is the
largest resource for known ta—siRNA regulatory pathways currently
available. tasiRNAdb also provides a tool named TasEprnalysis
that was developed to map user-submitted small RNA and degra-
dome libraries to a stored/input TAS and to perform sRNA phasing
analysis and TAS cleavage analysis.

Availability: The database of plant ta—siRNA regulatory pathways is
available at http://bioinfo.jit.edu.cn/tasiRNADatabasel.

1 INTRODUCTION

«phase-initiator» TAS transcript as

In plants a classical \ta_siRNA_,target gene
cascade model for the ta-siRNA regulatory function has been well
determined (Allen et al., 2005; Gasciolli et al., 2005; Yoshikawa
et al., 2005). Brieﬂy, a phase-initiator (usually a miRNA, but
sometimes a siRNA) cleaves the transcript of ta-siRNAs—produ—
cing locus (T AS) by binding argonaute (AGO) proteins 1/7. Then,
RDR6 (RNA-dependent RNA-polymerase 6)-dependent conver-
sion of the resulting cleaved fragments into dsRNA and subse-
quent cleavage by dicer-like 4 (DCL4) at every ~21 nucleotides
(nt) relative to the phase-initiator cleavage site generates a ta-
siRNA. The ta-siRNA further cleaves its target RNA to regulate
gene expression by binding AGOl proteins. The ta-siRNA regu-
latory pathways have been identiﬁed as important elements in the
gene networks involved in development, metabolism, response to
biotic and abiotic stresses and DNA methylation at the T AS locus
(Allen et al., 2005; Rajagopalan et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2012).
Recently, the cascade system has also been used as a valuable
tool in functional genomics studies (Felippes and Weigel, 2009).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Until recently, only a few ta-siRNA regulatory pathways were
characterized; but now, with the development and application of
integrative genome-wide approaches, including the genome-wide
computational identiﬁcation of T ASs and the cleaved validation
of miRNA/ta—siRNA—targeting site based on degradome analysis
or 5’ RACE, about 600 ta-siRNA regulatory pathways have been
reported in different plants. However, no comprehensive and inte-
grated ta-siRNA—related database is currently available.

Here, we present a database called tasiRNAdb of known plant
ta-siRNA regulatory pathways, which can serve as a repository
for the sequences of ta-siRNA pathway-related miRNAs, T ASs,
ta-siRNAs and ta-siRNA targets, and for the cascading relation
among them. tasiRNAdb also offers a tool named TasEprna—
lysis, which has been developed to map user-submitted RNA and
degradome libraries to a T AS and to allow users to perform T AS
cleavage analysis and sRNA phasing analysis within tasiRNAdb.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE DATABASE

2.1 Data acquisition

We obtained a list of publications from the NCBI PubMed data-
base using the keywords ‘"tasirnas"[All Fields] OR “ta-
siRNAs"[All Fields] OR “trans-acting sirnas"[All Fields] OR
“tasirna"[All Fields] OR “ta-siRNA"[All Fields] OR “trans-
acting sirna"[All F ields]"’. We manually extracted each ta-
siRNA regulatory pathway from each publication, and added
these ta-siRNA regulatory pathways to tasiRNAdb.

2.2 The tasiRNAdb interface and data processing

The tasiRNAdb currently contains 583 ta-siRNA regulatory
pathways from 18 plant species (Supplementary Table 51),
which cover 120 pairs of phased initiators and their targeted
sites, 77 T ASs, 457 pairs of ta-siRNAs and their targeted sites
and 296 ta-siRNAs target genes. ‘Home’ page and ‘tasiRNAdb
Table’ page are two entry points to these pathways.

The database is implemented on a Unix platform. All user inter-
faces and scripts are written in CGI—Perl, J avaScript and HTML
and are integrated with an Apache web server. In the present ver-
sion, users can submit new ta-siRNA regulatory pathway(s) to
tasiRNAdb via ‘Submit new pathway’ page, and view the sub-
mitted content via ‘Check submitted new pathway’ page. After
the submitted pathway passes administrator check in tasiRNAdb,
it will be processed by a background script and automatically added
to tasiRNAdb database. All the archived ta-siRNA regulatory
pathways can be displayed on ‘tasiRNAdb table’ page, where the

information for each pathway is showed in six sections: species,
phase initiator, T AS, ta-siRNA, targeted gene and reference(s),
and the basic information for each section is further hyperlinked
to a dynamic page (Supplementary Fig. S1). To only show the data
that meet the criteria that users specify, the contents of the table can
also be sorted and/or ﬁltered by species, phase initiator, T AS,
tasiRNA, targeted gene, and references. ‘tasiRNAdbSearch’ and
‘TasEprnalysis’ are two online tools developed to use the
archived data. They can respectively search the tasiRNAdb and
evaluate whether a T AS of interest is transcribed and cleaved to
produce ta-siRNA in user-sequenced sRNA dataset.

2.3 The TasEprnalysis tool

For researchers who have generated sRNAs sequence libraries, a
major challenge is to evaluate whether an interesting T AS among
the sRNA reads is cleaved by a phased-initiator and sliced by
DCL4 at every ~21 nt relative to the phase-initiator cleavage site
to produce functional ta-siRNAs. To meet this need, we de-
veloped the TasEprnalysis tool (Supplementary Fig. S2) and
integrated it into tasiRNAdb.

TasEprnalysis maps the sRNA and degradome reads sub-
mitted by the user to a selected/input T AS, and checks whether
the 5’ end of the RNA degradome fragment overlaps the T AS
cleavage start position. When an overlap is detected, TasEprna—
lysis searches the sRNA dataset to ﬁnd a phased initiator. Next,
the numbers of phased/non—phased positions with a sRNA hit on
the T AS are counted (phased positions refer to those arranged in
~21-nt increments relative to the cleavage start position; non-
phased positions are all other positions that are not phased pos-
itions or the start position). The P value of the detected conﬁgur-
ation is calculated based on a random hypergeometric distribution
using the following equation (Zhang et al., 2012, 2013):

min((k1+k2),(%x2-1))

P09) = Z

 

x=k1
((Lx2—1)— (2—L1x2—1)—(2—L1x 2— 1) x (2 xs))(2—L1X 2— 1)
k2 k1
(LX2—1)—(2—L1x2—1)x(2xs)
( k1+k2 )

where L is the length of T AS; k1 is the number of phased pos-
itions having sRNA hits; k2 is the number of non-phased pos-
itions having sRNA hits; and s is the maximum allowed offset
from the phase position

The TasEprnalysis counts the number of unique sRNA and
sRNA reads on different phasing registers and the number of
different length reads in the user-submitted sRNA dataset.

All the detected results are reported in a result page
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3 DISCUSSION

tasiRNAdb is an integrated database comprising a large number
of known ta-siRNA cascade pathways. Our aim in developing
tasiRNAdb was to collect known plant ta-siRNA cascade path-
ways and integrate them in such a way that the data could be freely
accessed and mined by users. tasiRNAdb is different from other
similar resources because it includes all plant species for which

such information is available. For example, ASRP currently col-
lects Arabidopsis T AS genes and aims mainly to provide a public
resource for genome-wide sRNA data from Arabidopsis
(Backman et al., 2008). MPSS aims to provide a signature-based
transcriptional resource for analyses of mRNA and sRNA
(Nakano et al., 2006) and currently contains Arabidopsis T ASs
and rice T ASs. CSRDB is a database of rice and maize sRNAs,
which aims to identify miRNAs and other functional sRNAs, map
miRNA transcription units, during development and as a function
of biotic and abiotic stress (Johnson et al., 2007). Our tasiRNAdb
currently contains 583 known ta-siRNA cascade pathways from
18 plant species, comprising 120 pairs of phased initiators and
their targeted sites, 77 ta-siRNA-generating loci, 457 pairs of ta-
siRNAs and their targeted sites and 296 ta-siRNAs target genes.
Consequently, tasiRNAdb provides more ta-siRNAs cascade
pathway information than ASRP, MPSS or CSRDB. Moreover,
web-based tools for evaluating whether a known/input T AS is
cleaved by phased-initiator and sliced by DCL4 at 21-nt intervals
to produce functional ta-siRNAs in user-sequenced sRNA data-
sets are unavailable. We have developed TasEprnalysis to meet
this need. We evaluated the performance of TasEprnalysis with
an RDR sRNA MPSS library (Lu et al., 2006) and default par-
ameters. All six atT A Ss previously reported in the sample, includ-
ing atTASIa, atTASIb, atTASIc, atTASZ, atTAS3a and
at] g63130, were successfully identiﬁed by TasEprnalysis
(Supplementary Table S2). They all have a signiﬁcant P value of
<0.005. In addition, the other two known atTASs stored in
tasiRNAdb, including atTAS3b and atTAS3c, were also identiﬁed
by TasEprnalysis. TasEprnalysis could be a useful tool for
characterizing sRNAs from deep sequencing data.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Text mining from the biomedical literature is of increasing
importance, yet it is not easy for the bioinformatics community to
create and run text mining workflows due to the lack of accessibility
and interoperability of the text mining resources. The U-Compare
system provides a wide range of bio text mining resources in a highly
interoperable workflow environment where workflows can very easily
be created, executed, evaluated and visualized without coding. We
have linked U-Compare to Taverna, a generic workflow system, to
expose text mining functionality to the bioinformatics community.

1 INTRODUCTION

Owing to the large and rapidly growing body of literature in
the biological sciences text mining approaches are increasingly
important for the extraction and collation of data. The collation
of text mining data with bioinformatics databases is a separate
topic (Krallinger et al., 2008) which space precludes enlarging
on here. Yet many text mining methods are difﬁcult to integrate
with other bioinformatics tools as development tends to focus
upon mining performance more than implementing accessible
interfaces. U—Compare (Kano et al., 2009) is an all—in—one text
mining system based on the UIMA (Unstructured Information
Management Architecture) framework (Ferrucci et al., 2006).
U—Compare mainly consists of two parts: the world—largest ready—
to—use UIMA component repository, and an all—in—one text mining
platform.

In text mining data structures tend to be more complex (e.g.
phrase structures) than in bioinformatics so interoperability, which
guarantees data type compatibility as implemented in U—Compare,
is required to create text mining workﬂows easily. With text mining
workﬂows simpliﬁed, users would naturally seek integration of
text mining workﬂows with other bioinformatics resources. Taverna

(Hull et al., 2006) is a generic workﬂow construction system widely
used in bioinformatics. We have developed mechanisms that allow
users to embed any U—Compare workﬂow in a Taverna workﬂow.
As U—Compare is designed to facilitate the construction of text
mining workﬂows, it is far simpler to expose a complete U—Compare
workﬂow to Taverna than to construct the equivalent workﬂow from
individual components within Taverna, which lacks text mining
speciﬁc data structures. It is therefore the easiest way to add text
mining functionality to Taverna.

2 SYSTEM FEATURES AND EXAMPLE
WORKFLOWS

The U—Compare system itself is a stand—alone application. In this
platform, users can create a workﬂow from the components in the
repository, or any third—party UIMA components, in an easy drag—
and—drop manner and compare, evaluate and visualize the workﬂow
results. The entire system can be started by a single mouse click
in the U—Compare website. Workﬂows can also be executed via the
command line without the GUI based platform.

2.1 U-Compare Taverna plugin

The U—Compare Taverna plugin works with Taverna version 2.1.0.
The user must specify two options: the U—Compare workﬂow to
embed and a post—processing Beanshell script with proper I/O
ports to appropriately reformat the output for further processes in
Taverna. This post—processing script is executed as the ﬁnal UIMA
component in the U—Compare workﬂow. UIMA and U—Compare
APIs can be used in the script. Upon running the Taverna workﬂow
the U—Compare application starts and runs the speciﬁed text
mining workﬂow automatically, then shows U—Compare GUIs
such as statistics and visualizations of generated annotations. This
plugin is implemented to download, install and update U—Compare
automatically. Users are only required to install the plugin from the
Taverna’s menu by inputting the plugin URL. As running GUIs can
be demanding when processing a large number of documents this
plugin is mainly for testing and analyzing with results visualization.

Users can deploy two modes of workﬂow inputs to the U—Compare
Taverna plugin. In the typical mode, the U—Compare workﬂow
takes a collection reader as input, generates a list of annotated
documents as output. We have also implemented another mode to
link speciﬁcally with Taverna where the input is not the collection

reader but instead a list of String (depth 1) which is passed to the
‘input_text’ port of the U—Compare plugin.

2.2 U-Compare activity with command line mode

As any workﬂow can also be called via the command line we
provide special UIMA components, which reads input text and
writes generated annotations via the standard I/O streams. Using
U—Compare’s command line mode, we created an example Taverna
workﬂow of a protein—protein interaction extraction, selected to
show its usefulness in systems biology (Ananiadou et al., 2010). This
workﬂow outputs a possible interaction network from the literature
associated with a PubMed query. Extracted information is available
in Supplementary Material. This example workﬂow is provided as
a template for users to create their own workﬂow by imitating,
reusing and modifying the interpretation part. Since U—Compare
outputs results in a uniform format users only need to change the
speciﬁc data types and their corresponding ﬁelds to create their own
workﬂows, reusing most the template codes without modiﬁcation.
Figure 1 shows a diagram of the example Taverna workﬂow. A box
labeled ‘UCompare’ corresponds to a Beanshell script activity, calls
U—Compare via the command line. In this article, a mechanism
to download, install and update the U—Compare system is also
implemented, so there is no need to explicitly install anything. In
parts prior to ‘UCompare’, this workﬂow retrieves documents from
PubMed, passes them to the U—Compare activity, then interprets the
results in parts following ‘UCompare’.

An example run of the workﬂow, which sets ‘PubMed_Query’
and ‘workﬂowPath’ parameters in the Figure 1, and its result are
given in Supplementary Material for the top 50 hits from the query
‘saccharomyces AND “translation initiation” ’. The ‘workﬂowPath’
is set to a U—Compare workﬂow given in the Supplementary
Material, which runs ‘UIMA Sentence Splitter’ to detect sentence
boundaries, ‘ABNER’ (Settles, 2005) to detect protein named
entities and ‘EventMine’ (Miwa et al., 2010) to detect interaction
events. Evaluations of the text mining tools are provided in
U—Compare (Kano et al., 2009). This example run detects 677 non—
unique entities, which by exact string matching correspond to 371
unique entity names, and 254 non—unique binding events.

2.3 U-Compare as a generic text mining workﬂow

The Taverna U—Compare workﬂow illustrated in Figure 1 can be used
to run any U—Compare workﬂow, and does not require reworking
for different text mining analyses. Whilst developing a new text
mining workﬂow does involve conﬁguration within the U—Compare
environment, once developed, it can be deployed within the Taverna
activity described here by resetting the ‘workﬂowPath’ value to the
location of the new workﬂow’s descriptor, relative to a directory
[user home]/.UCompare/taverna/classpath—rooti.

3 SUMMARY

U—Compare and Taverna focus upon different target domains, with
the former utilizing a more strongly typed system speciﬁcally
designed to handle the particular problems of text mining, while

the latter offers a more generic solution for broader applications. By
linking U—Compare with Taverna, we provide an easy way to create
and embed complex text mining workﬂows within Taverna.

Abstract

Motivation: Identifying drug—target protein interaction is a crucial step in the process of drug re—
search and development. Wet—lab experiment are laborious, time—consuming and expensive.
Hence, there is a strong demand for the development of a novel theoretical method to identify
potential interaction between drug and target protein.

Results: We use all known proteins and drugs to construct a nodes— and edges—weighted biological
relevant interactome network. On the basis of the ‘guilt—by—association’ principle, novel network
topology features are proposed to characterize interaction pairs and random forest algorithm is em—
ployed to identify potential drug—protein interaction. Accuracy of 92.53% derived from the 10—fold
cross—validation is about 10% higher than that of the existing method. We identify 2272 potential
drug—target interactions, some of which are associated with diseases, such as Torg—Winchester
syndrome and rhabdomyosarcoma. The proposed method can not only accurately predict the
interaction between drug molecule and target protein, but also help disease treatment and drug
discovery.

1 Introduction

Most drugs are a class of small molecule compounds which act by
activating or inhibiting the biological activity or function of the spe—
cific target proteins. Identifying interaction between drug and target
can help to not only reduce the time, cost and failure rates for new
developing drug (Kim et 61]., 2013), but also decipher the mechanism
of drug action (Bantscheff and Drewes, 2012) and pathomechanism
of disease (Wang et 61]., 2012).

Experimental methods containing affinity chromatography and
protein microarray have been widely adopted to identify drug—target
interaction (Cheng et 61]., 2011). However, these methods are

ineffective in the face of massive biomolecules data. With the com—
pletion of the Human Genome Project and development of combina—
torial chemistry, abundant biological and chemical data have been
generated and deposited in the various database. As of January
2015, the UniProtKB (Boutet et 61]., 2007) and ChEMBL (Gaulton
et 61]., 2012) contain 142 140 human protein entities and 1 638 394
compound entities, respectively. Undoubtedly, it is impossible to
carry out an exhaustive experiment for detecting all possible inter—
actions between these proteins and compounds, because the pair—
wise combinations are astronomical. It motivates researchers to
develop a theoretical method to not only quickly and accurately

discriminate the potential drug—target interactions, but also guide
experimentalists and provide supporting evidence for their experi-
mental results (Gonen, 2012).

Currently, many studies show that relationship between disease
and drug is far more complex than the ‘one gene, one drug, one dis—
ease’ paradigm (Pei et al., 2014). Since proteins often interact with
each other and with other molecules in cells to form an interaction
network, network—based researches have emerged as a promising al—
ternative to accelerate the identification of drug—target interaction
(Alaimo et al., 2013; Chen et al., 2012; Cheng et al., 2012a,b; Mei
et al., 2013; Xia et al., 2010; Yamanishi et al., 2008; Yildirim et al.,
2007). These works generally model the drug—target interactions as
a bipartite graph, in which vertex corresponds to either drug mol—
ecule or target protein, edge corresponds to drug—target interaction.
Then, various strategies are utilized to mine the bipartite graph and
predict potential drug—target interaction based on the known
interaction.

In spite of the advances in bipartite graph—based methods, it is a
challenge to accurately identify drug—target interaction. The first
reason is that most existing approaches only consider the interaction
of drug—target, and neglect the interaction of protein—protein and re-
lationship of drug—drug. Indeed, target protein usually exerts their
function by interacting with other protein rather than working alone
at the cellular level (Baudot et al., 2012; Chi and Hou, 2011).
Structurally different drugs can bind to the multiple targets and ex—
press similar or identical bioactivities. Additionally, more than one
drug can be synergistically used in the treatment of diseases. The se—
cond one is that bipartite graph—based methods do not consider the
false positive of protein—protein interaction. Currently, protein—
protein interaction data mainly comes from the yeast two—hybrid
and affinity purification with mass spectrometry. But, the two meth—
ods usually suffer from high false positive rate due to the technical
limitation. The third one is that drug and protein are only con—
sidered as nodes in mathematics, and ignore their biological or
chemical properties. In fact, the interaction between drug and target
is inﬂuenced by many factors, such as volume, shape and charge of
drug compound as well as hydrophobicity, polarity and tertiary
structure of target protein. The fourth one is that only known targets
are utilized to construct the bipartite graph. Therefore, they are usu—
ally unable to discover the new interaction of drug—target excluded
in the constructed network. The last one is that the information of
network topology is not adopted to recognize drug—target inter—
action. Research of protein—protein interaction network have shown
that target proteins usually have higher degree and betweenness cen—
trality than non—target proteins (Hase et al., 2009; Kotlyar et al.,
2012; Yao and thetsky, 2008), implying that network topology in—
formation can be utilized to differentiate target proteins from non—
target proteins.

In view of these reasons, we develop a novel theoretical compu—
tation method to infer drug—target interaction based on the ‘guilt—
by—association’ principle and network topology features. Instead of
using only the bipartite network of drug—target interaction, we con—
struct a drug—target interactome network containing three subnet—
works of protein—protein interaction, drug—target interaction and
drug—drug relationship to grasp the complex interaction relationship
between drug and target. Each node in the interactome network is
weighted by using either protein primary sequence descriptors or
drug molecular structure features to characterize their attributes. In
the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction and drug—drug rela—
tionship, edge is weighted based on the protein interaction probabil—
ity score and the number of common target protein, respectively.
With the use of the network topology information, we develop a

novel network topology feature vector to characterize drug—target
interaction. The underlying assumption is ‘guilt—by—association’, in
which a target protein is likely to interact with a drug if the majority
of protein’s neighbors (i.e. they can directly interact with the protein
in the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction) can interact with
the drug, vice versa. Finally, we employ random forest (RF) algo-
rithm (Leo, 2001) to construct model for identifying potential drug—
target interaction.

2 Methods

2.1 Construction of drug—target interactome network

In order to construct the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction,
we retrieve the human protein—protein interaction data from the
HIPPIE database (Schaefer et al., 2012). After deleting self—inter—
actions, repeated interactions and interactions with interaction con—
fidence score 0, a protein—protein interaction subnetwork is
acquired (Supplementary file PPIN.xlsx). Protein primary structure
is retrieved from the UniprotKB/Swiss—Prot (Boutet et al., 2007)
based on the access number (AC). To reflect the protein properties,
we calculate primary structure descriptors (i.e. vertex weights) with
1767—dimensions and containing amino acid composition (20—
dimensions), dipeptide composition (400—dimensions), normalized
Moreau—Broto autocorrelation (400—dimensions), Moran autocor—
relation (400—dimensions), Geary autocorrelation (400—dimensions),
composition (21-dimensions), transition (21-dimensions) and distri-
bution (105 —dimensions).

In order to build the subnetwork of drug—drug relationship
(Supplementary file DDRN.xlsx), we download the data of small
molecule drug with detailed structural formula and molecular
weight less than 1000 Da from the DrugBank database (Law et al.,
2014). After removing those compounds that their target proteins
do not belong to the human species and include them in the built
subnetwork of protein—protein interaction, we retrieve the informa-
tion of molecular structure from the file of all.sdf.zip based on the
identification (ID). Each vertex of the subnetwork is weighted by
using molecular fingerprint feature vector with 1024—dimensions by
the calculation of the PaDEL—Descriptor software (Yap, 2011). In
the binary vector, elements 1 and 0 indicate the presence or absence
of a specific chemical substructure. The molecular fingerprint fea-
ture has been widely used in the studies of quantitative structure—
activity relationship (Dimova et al., 2013; Rabal et al., 2015). Two
drugs are interconnected through a weighted edge if they share at
least one target protein. The weight of edge is defined |C|/
min(|A|,|B|), where |A| and |B| represent the number of target pro—
tein of chemical A and chemical B, |C| is the number of shared target
protein, and min(|A|, |B|) denotes the smallest value between |A| and
|B|. According to the definition, the edge weight locates in the range
of [0, 1]. A larger weight value means that two drugs have more
common target proteins, higher similar structure and bioactivity.

Based on the downloaded drug information, we construct the
drug—target interaction subnetwork (Supplementary file DTIN.
xlsx), in which a drug belonging to the subnetwork of drug—drug re—
lationship and a target belonging to the subnetwork of protein—
protein interaction is connected to each other if drug and target
interact, and the corresponding weight is set to 1.

Finally, the drug—target interactome network is constructed by
mapping AC of target protein in the drug—target interaction subnet—
work to AC of protein in the protein—protein interaction network,
and ID of drug in the drug—target interaction subnetwork to ID of
drug in the drug—drug relationship subnetwork. The interactome is

composed of 240 300 edges and 17695 nodes. In all these edges,
153 749 edges represent protein—protein interactions, 77 713 drug—
drug relationships, 8838 drug—target interactions. In all these nodes,
14 086 are proteins in which 1523 are drug targets, 3609 are small
molecule drugs in which 1038 are approved by the FDA, the remain-
ing are experimental compounds, illicit or withdrawn drugs.

2.2 Characterization of drug—target interaction

In a network—based method for predicting drug—target interaction, it
is one of the most important things to develop a suitable encoding
method for extracting core and essential attributes of drug—target
interaction. However, it is by no means easy to characterize the at—
tributes, because it is highly related to the structures of drug mol—
ecule and target protein, and deeply hidden in the complicated
interaction network. In order to solve the problem, we utilize the
‘guilt—by—association’ principle to encode the interaction informa-
tion. Based on the principle, we assume that a drug molecule tends
to attack a target protein if the majority of the drug’s neighbors in
the interactome network interacts with the target, vice versa.

For an interaction between drug d and target protein p, we firstly
find the neighbor molecules of drug d in the subnetwork of drug—
drug relationship and the corresponding edge weights. By consider—
ing the topology information of neighbor molecules, vertex weights
and edge weights, we further calculate the network topology feature
of the drug d (DNTFd) based on the following Eq. (1).

1 N
DNTFd=NZDd(i)xEd,-><D,(i) (i=1, 2, .... ..,1o24) (1)
i=1

where, Dd(i) and Dj(z') represent the ith node weight of drug d and
neighbor molecule 1', respectively. Ed),- implies the edge weight be—
tween d and j. N is the number of neighbor molecules. According to
the definition, DNTFd is a feature vector with 1024 dimensions. If
the neighbor molecules do not exist (i.e. N = 0), we define
DNTFd = Dd.

Secondly, we search the neighbor molecules of target protein p in
the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction and the correspond—
ing edge weights. We also calculate the network topology feature of
target protein [J (PNTFP) according to the Eq. (2).

1 N
PNTF =— P i ><E -><P-z' i=1, 2, .... ..,1767 (2)
P N P Pal I
i=1

In this equation, Pp(z') and Pj(i) indicate the ith node weight of target
protein [J and neighbor 1', respectively. EW- is the interaction confi—
dence score (i.e. edge weight) between target protein [J and protein 1'.
N is the number of neighbor proteins. According to the Eq. (2),
PNTFp is a feature vector with 1767 dimensions. If the target pro—
tein has no neighbors (i.e. N = 0), we define PNTFp : Pp.

Finally, we formulate the interaction between drug d and target
p as a feature vector with 2791 (1024 —l— 1767) dimensions by con-
catenating DNTFd and PNTFp This combinational network top—
ology features consider simultaneously the interaction attributes
from drug molecules and target proteins.

2.3 Construction of model and assessment of
performance

In our study, the identification of drug—target interaction can be
viewed as a missing edge prediction problem, meaning that the sub—
network of drug—target interaction is an incomplete graph with
missing edges. Our goal is to make use of the observed edges to con—
struct a classifier and predict whether an edge exists between

potential drug molecule and target protein. Matlab version of the
RF algorithm downloaded at http://code.google.com/p/randomfor
est—matlab/ is adopted, because the prediction can be formulated as
a binary classification problem (i.e. the presence or absence of an
edge between drug node and protein node) from the perspective of
statistics and machine learning.

For the binary classification problem, false sample of drug—target
interaction (i.e. non—interaction pair between drug and target) is es—
sential for constructing classifier. Unfortunately, there is no data—
base dedicated to the collection of experimentally verified negative
drug—target interaction. Therefore, we use the following strategy to
generate non—interaction sample: (1) randomly couple any protein in
the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction and any drug in the
subnetwork of drug—drug relationship into a false sample of drug—
protein interaction, (2) eliminate the negative sample contained in
the collected dataset of true drug—target interaction, (3) repeat step
(1) and (2) until the number of negative sample reaches the same
number as the positive sample. The generated negative samples are
unlikely to contain a large number of positive drug—target inter—
action samples that have not been proven until now, because the
fact that the amount of true drug—target interaction is smaller than
that of false drug—target interaction. Finally, a benchmark dataset
containing all true drug—target interactions and false drug—target
interactions with equal size to positive samples is established. The
proportion of ‘1:1’ can overcome the limitation of the larger number
of negative samples and result in unbiased prediction.

Taking into account the comparison with other existing meth—
ods, we carry out 10—fold cross—validation, in which the benchmark
dataset is randomly split into 10 equally sized subsets. Every time,
one distinct subset and remaining nine subsets are utilized to train
and test classifier, respectively. In addition to the conventional meas—
ures of accuracy (Ace), sensitivity (Sen), specificity (Spe), Precision
(Pre) and Matthews correlation coefficient (Mcc), we also employ
receiver operating characteristic curve (ROC) and precision recall
(also known as Sen) curve (PRC) to estimate the predictive ability of
the model. The two curves are obtained by plotting Sen versus 1—Sen
and Pre versus recall by gradually changing threshold. We adopt the
trapezoidal approximation to calculate the areas under ROC and
PRC for assessing prediction performance, because the uppermost
curve with the largest area indicates that the constructed model is
the most outstanding.

Flowchart of the developed method is illustrated in Figure 1, and
the steps are follows:

Step 1. Retrieve the information of human protein—protein inter-
action and drug—target interaction from the HIPPIE and
DrugBank database, respectively.

Step 2. Construct the interactome network containing three subnet—
works of protein—protein interaction, drug—drug relationship and
drug—target interaction. Nodes and edges are weighted based on
the information of protein sequence, molecular structure and inter—
action among them.

Step 3. Calculate the network topological feature to characterize
drug—target interaction based on the ‘guilt—by—association’ prin—
ciple and graph theory.

Step 4. Utilize RF algorithm to construct classiﬁer for identifying po-
tential drug—target interaction pairs. In this step, the number of
trees (ntree) contained in forest and the number of variables (mtry)
randomly selected at each node of tree are set to 100 and default
value (i.e. square root of the number of all features), respectively.
Two—thirds and one—third of the benchmark dataset are considered
as in—bag samples and out—of—bag samples, respectively.

3 Results

3.1 Construction and evaluation of model

For the current study, RF model is constructed to identify the poten—
tial drug—target interaction. Moreover, various combinations be—
tween ntree changing from 100 to 1000 with a step size 100 and
mtry changing from 20 to 27 with a step size 21 are also utilized to
construct classifiers. However, the significant improvement for pre-
diction performance is not observed.

In order to investigate the robustness of the current method for ran—
dom sampling (i.e. generate negative samples), the process of bench—
mark dataset constructing, classifier building and assessing is repeated
10 times. The statistical results of Ace, Sen, Spe, Pre and Mee as well
as ROC and PRC derived from the model with the highest Ace are
shown in Figure 2. From Figure 2A, we can see that our method ob—
tains the statistical average of 92.5 3%, 94.05%, 91.01%, 91.28% and
0.8510 for Ace, Sen, Spe, Pre and Mee, and the corresponding relative
standard deviations are only 0.19%, 0.21%, 0.26%, 0.24% and
0.42%. The results indicates that the current method has strong ro—
bustness for the sampling of negative samples. Figure 2B exhibits that
the proposed algorithm achieves the areas under ROC and PRC up to
0.9799 and 0.9609, revealing the excellent effectiveness of the current
method. From the two curves, additionally, we can also observe that
the proposed method can effectively capture sufficient information to
identify the drug—target interaction with high true—positive rates against
low false—positive rates, and with high positive predictive values against
low true—positive rates at any threshold. In one word, these results indi—
cate that the proposed method has an excellent capability for predict—
ing the interaction between drug and target.

3.2 Effectiveness ofthe ‘guilt—by—association’ principle
To demonstrate the excellent performance of the current method
with the use of the principle of ‘guilt—by—association’, we perform a
comparison with work of Cao et al. (2013) based on the constructed
10 benchmark datasets in the Section 3.1. In their study, compound
structure and protein sequence are firstly converted into numerical
descriptors based on the various methods and feature vectors. Then,
the chemical—protein interaction is simply represented by concate—
nating these chemical and protein descriptor. Finally, the concaten—
ated vector is input into a machine learning model to predict
whether an interaction occurs between a given chemical and a spe—
cific protein. In the comparison, a feature vector by concatenating
our protein descriptors and fingerprint features is used to character—
ize drug—target interaction following their work. Then, RF algo-
rithm is adopted to construe model and predict interaction between
drug and target protein.

The statistical results as well as ROC and PRC derived from the
classifier with the highest Ace are shown in Figure 2. From Figure2A,
we can see that the average Ace, Sen, Spe and Pre are 82.27%,
84.47%, 80.07% and 80.91%, which are about 10% lower than
those of the current method. Mee is about 0.5 lower than that of the
proposed method. Figure 2B shows that the values of Sen and Pre at
the ROC and PRC are always consistently lower than those from the
current method when the false—positive rate and recall are changed
from 0 to 1. The areas under the two curves are 0.9079 and 0.8983,
about 0.07 lower than those of the current method. These results in—
dicate that our approach is superior to the methods from the litera-
ture, and the encoding strategy based on the ‘guilt—by—association’
principle is able to efficiently capture the drug—target interaction in—
formation embedded in the interaction network.

3.3 Predictive ability of the developed method for novel
drug—target interaction
In order to validate the prediction ability of drug—target interaction,
researchers (Ding et al., 2014; Gonen, 2012; Pahikkala et al., 2015;
van Laarhoven et al., 2011; Yamanishi et al., 2008) usually utilize
four different prediction scenarios to confirm the prediction perform-
ance. In these scenarios, targets and drugs contained in the training
set are called ‘known’ whereas those involved in the test set are called
‘new’. The four scenarios are: (i) predicting whether a known target
and a known drug can interact with each other (i.e. target and drug
are enclosed in the training set), (ii) inferring a new target for a
known drug (i.e. target and drug are contained in the test set and
training set, respectively), (iii) finding a new drug for a known target
(i.e. drug and target are involved in the test set and training set, re—
spectively), (iv) estimating whether a new target and a new drug can
interact with each other (i.e. target and drug are included in the test
set). The first scenario is the most widely used in experimental design
for theoretical prediction, in which the objective is to predict the
missing interactions without going outside the training space
(Pahikkala et al., 2015). The second and third are the real situations
with practical value, in which only drug information or target infor-
mation is used during the model construction phase, and can be em—
ployed to study drug reposition, drug off—target, drug combination
and drug promiscuity, etc. The fourth is the most rigorous setting, in
which neither drug information nor target information is adopted
during the model training phase, and can be utilized to design novel
drugs. In the current study, we use the fourth scenario to demonstrate
the prediction performance by a series of non—redundant datasets.

In order to construct non—redundant datasets, we define the simi—
larity between two drug—target interaction pairs. For the two

interaction pairs of pl—dl and pZ—dz, we first calculate the protein
sequence similarity between [)1 and [)2 by using the Needleman—
Wunsch algorithm and scoring matrix of BLOSUM50. Second, cal—
culate the drug structure similarity between d1 and d2 based on the
absolute value of Pearson’s correlation coefficient of molecular fin-
gerprint descriptors by using Eq. (3):

Here Dal1  and Dd,  means the ith fingerprint feature value of d1
and d2, D—d1 and D—d2 are the mean values of all fingerprint feature
values of d1 and d2. N = 1024, and abs represents the operation of
absolute value. According to the definition, Rd1,d2 is located in the
range of [0, 1]. ‘1’ means that the two drug molecules d1 and d2 are
completely identical, ‘0’ means that they are completely different.
Finally, the similarity between the two interaction pairs is obtained
by calculating the mean value of sequence similarity and structure
similarity. According to the definition, the similarity of two drug—
target interaction pairs is always located between 0 and 1, the num—
ber of ‘1’ represents the two interaction pairs with complete identi—
cal, ‘0’ shows complete difference. By setting the similarity threshold
of 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, . . . , 0.9, we can construct 8 non—redundant drug—
target interaction databases, in which the similarity between any
two interaction pairs is always lower than a given threshold. We do
not set threshold to 0.1, because the corresponding non—redundant
dataset only contains 6 true drug—target interaction pairs, the num-
ber is too small to have statistical significant.

The results of 10—fold cross—validation test for these non—redun—
dant datasets are listed in Table 1. We can observe that with the de—
crease of the threshold from 0.9 to 0.2, Ace, Sen, Spe, Pre and Mee
are also gradually reduced. Our method achieves Ace up to 91.97%
when the threshold is set to 0.9. Ace is always higher than 80%
when the threshold is decreased from 0.8 to 0.3. The current method
still obtains Ace of 77.52% even if the threshold is reduced to 0.2.
Therefore, we can conclude that the proposed method has the excel—
lent performance for predicting novel drug—target interaction. Based
on these non—redundant datasets, we further perform a comparison
with work of Cao et al. (2013), and results also demonstrate the su—
periority of our method (see Supplementary Materials for details).

3.4 Robustness of the proposed model for false positive
of protein—protein interactions

We construct the subnetwork of human protein—protein interaction
in order to consider the target network topology information in the

process of encoding drug—target interaction samples. The con—
structed subnetwork may contain some false positive interactions
due to drawbacks in experimental techniques for detecting protein—
protein interaction. In order to overcome the problem of false posi—
tive, an interaction confidence score in the range of [0, 1] is assigned
to each protein—protein interaction for explicating the possibility of
interaction. In this section, the robustness for false positive rate is
investigated by constructing 8 subnetworks of protein—protein inter-
action with the interaction confidence score higher than 0.1,
0.2, . . . , 0.8, respectively. Please note that we do not build and dis—
cuss the subnetwork with interaction confidence higher than 0.9, be—
cause it is composed of 1781 proteins and 3030 protein—protein
interactions, but only one protein (Q13085) is the drug target.

For the various human protein—protein interaction subnetwork,
we construct corresponding eight dataset and then carry out 10—fold
cross—validation test. From the Table 2, it is illustrated that Ace, Sen,
Spe, Pre and Mee always ﬂuctuate slightly in the range of [92.55%,
92.75%], [93.99%, 94.44%], [90.90%, 91.40%], [91.21%,
91.63%] and [0.8513, 0.8554], respectively. More stringently, our
method still achieves more than 92% of Ace, Sen, Spe and Pre, 0.84
of Mee when the interaction confidence score is further increased to
0.7 and 0.8. The results indicates that the current method has a
good robustness for false positive rate of protein—protein
interaction.

3.5 Identification of potential drug—protein interaction

After verifying the performance of the current method, we conduct a
comprehensive prediction for unknown drug—protein interaction
pairs by using the model derived from the constructed redundant
dataset and with the highest Ace. In these unknown interaction
pairs, drug and protein comes from the subnetwork of drug—drug re—
lationship and the subnetwork of protein—protein interaction, re—
spectively. And, these unknown interaction pairs are produced by
randomly combining drug and protein. Finally, the constructed
model identifies a total of 41 749 potential drug—protein inter-
actions between 3406 drugs and 5972 proteins. We rank all the po—
tential interaction pairs according to the votes in descending order,
and the results show that 2272 interaction pairs (Supplementary file
PredDTIP.xlsx) are the most likely to be putative interactions be—
cause their votes are higher than 90 (i.e. in all 100 trees in forest,
interaction is predicted by more than 90 trees). Then we check (see
Supplementary Materials for details) whether these predicted inter—
action pairs appear in BindingDB database (Liu et al., 2007), which
is a public and web—accessible database of measured binding affin-
ities between proteins and small, drug—like molecules. Results show
that there are 6 predicted drug—protein interaction pairs recorded in
the BindingDB (Supplementary file ComDTIP.xlsx). By comparing

randomly selected 2272 interaction pairs from all predicted inter—
actions with the interactions from the BindingDB database, the ex—
pected value is calculated to be 3.5447 (see Supplementary
Materials for details), indicating that the number of common drug—
target interaction pairs is 3.5447 when randomly comparing our
predicted interactions with collected interactions. Therefore, we can
conclude that our developed method has a certain capability and re—
liability in practical usage.

Here, we take the 2 predicted and toped drug—protein interaction
pairs as examples to illustrate the application of current method.
The binding between experimental drug N—{2-[(4’-cyano-1,1’-bi-
phenyl-4-yl)oxy]ethyl}-N’-hydroxy-N—methylurea (DB06971) and
protein 72 kDa type IV collagenase (P0825 3) identified by our
method (98 votes) is annotated in the BindingDB and supported by
evidence derived from the reference (Campestre et al., 2006). The
DB06971 is an organic compound and belongs to biphenylcarboni—
triles. The P0825 3 is an ubiquitinous metalloproteinase with various
functions such as remodeling of the vasculature, angiogenesis, tissue
repair tumor invasion, inflammation and atherosclerotic plaque rup—
ture. To further study and confirm the interaction, we perform
docking simulations based on the AutoDock program (Santos—
Martins et al., 2014) and DS Visualizer software. The three—dimen—
sional structural information of protein and drug are downloaded
from the http://www.rcsb.org/pdb (ID: 1CK7) and http://www.drug
bank.ca/drugs/DB06971, respectively. The grid center coordinates
of box are set to 82.37A, 101.67A and 159.155A. The Lamarckian
genetic algorithm is employed to search the docking conformation.
Finally, we obtain the optimal docking model with binding energy
—8.44 kcal/mol and inhibition constant (K) 655.08 nM. Complex
model of ligand and receptor as well as their interaction are shown
in Figure 3. We can see that there are Van der Waals interactions be—
tween drug molecule and amino acid residues Ile478, Gln480,
Val523, Tyr524, Pro527, Ala571, Phe572, Ser575, Val620, Val621
and Gln624. The small molecular drug is connected to the target
protein through hydrogen bonds between Asn573 and carbonyl
group as well as Trp5 74, Lys5 78 and hydroxyl. Meanwhile, there
are carbon hydrogen bond between the drug and Asp622, n—donor

hydrogen bond between phenyl ring and Asn5 73. Additionally, it is
also shown that electrostatic interaction (it—anion) and hydrophobic
interaction (n—a) are formed between phenyl ring and Glu525 as
well as phenyl ring and Ala479. These results show that the prob—
ability of interaction between the drug and the protein is very high.
Some studies (Martignetti et al., 2001; Rouzier et al., 2006; Zankl
et al., 2005) have shown that the variation of protein is associated
with the multicentric osteolysis, nodulosis and arthropathy
(MONA, also known as Torg—Winchester syndrome). Therefore, we
can speculate that the drug DB06971 can be used to treat the syn—
drome through targeting the protein P0825 3.

Etoposide (DB00773) is a semisynthetic derivative of podophyl—
lotoxin and utilized to treat various cancers, such as leukemia, small
cell lung cancer, malignant lymphoma, ovarian cancer, choriocar—
cinoma, testicular cancer, bladder cancer and prostate cancer, by in—
hibiting DNA synthesis. In DrugBank database, the etoposide
attacks two known target proteins (Azarova et al., 2007; Uesaka
et al., 2007), namely DNA topoisomerase 2—oc (P11388) and DNA
topoisomerase 2—ﬂ (Q02880). Interestingly, a new target protein, nu—
clear receptor coactivator 1 (Q15 788) is predicted for the drug mol—
ecule with 98 votes. And, the new predicted interaction is also
supported by evidences derived from the BindingDB. We also per-
form docking simulations based on the three—dimensional structural
information of protein 3KMR in the PDB database and drug
DB00773 in the DrugBank database. The grid center coordinates x,
y and z of box are set to —7.342A, —12.289A and —14.4A. The op-
timal complex model with binding energy —8.38 KJ/mol and K
655 .08 nM is obtained and shown in the Figure 3. We can observe
that the drug is connected to the protein by hydrogen bonds between
Asp226, Ser229, Ser405 and hydroxyl, Gly404 and carbonyl,
Trp225 and oxygen, Met406 and hydrogen (carbon hydrogen
bond), Ser405 and hydrogen (carbon hydrogen bond) as well as
Ser405 and phenyl ring (it—donor hydrogen bond). Additionally,
there are hydrophobic interactions between Pro407 and drug (alkyl
hydrophobic) as well as Trp225 and drug (n—alkyl hydrophobic).
And, Van der Waals interaction between the drug and the target
protein happens through Ile222, Thr233, Glu230, Ile402 and
Pro403. A chromosomal aberration involving Q15 788 causes
rhabdomyosarcoma, which is the most common soft tissue carcin—
oma in childhood, representing 5—8% of all malignancies in children
(Wachtel et al., 2004). Therefore, we can reasonably speculate that
the drug may also be repositioned in the treatment of
rhabdomyosarcoma.

In one word, all above outcomes enhance the strength of the cur—
rent method for realistic drug—target interaction prediction applica—
tion, these putative drug—target interactions provide invaluable
information for experimentalist, especially in solving problems asso—
ciated with drug repositioning, drug combination and drug promis-
cuity, etc.

4 Discussion

Effectiveness and performance of the current method is evaluated
against various datasets through the 10—fold cross—validation and
confirmed by comparing with the existing methods, and the results
indicate that our method can accurately predict the interaction be—
tween drug molecule and target protein. Robustness on the false
positive protein—protein interaction is also confirmed based on a ser—
ies of constructed protein interaction network and the correspond—
ing drug—target interaction datasets. Success of the developed
method can be attributed to three aspects. Firstly, using interactome
network supplies a comprehensive and system viewpoint to identify

potential drug—target interaction and understand the interaction
mechanisms. Secondly, integrating drug molecular structure infor—
mation with target protein sequence information into a unified
framework provides further insight for the nature of the interaction
between drug and protein. Thirdly, resorting the ‘guild—by—associ—
ation’ principle opens up a new avenue to develop topology features
for characterizing drug—target interaction pairs in the context of
network.

The main advantages of the current approach are summarized as
follows: (i) compared with the structure—based theoretical methods,
our method is not constrained by the 3D structure data of targets; (ii)
in contrast to experimental methods, the developed approach only
takes a few seconds to identify whether a drug targets a protein at the
proteome scale; (iii) the proposed approach is able to identify those
drug—target interaction pairs with low protein sequence similarity and
drug structure similarity; (iv) the developed method can aid in the re—
search of drug repositioning and drug promiscuity by recognizing an
interaction between a new target protein and a known drug.

Of course, our approach also has some limitations. For example,
it can predict only the binding between proteins and all known drugs
because the constructed drug—drug relationship subnetwork only con-
tains the drug molecules from the DrugBank. Currently, we are trying
to expand the subnetwork by adding a variety of small molecule com—
pounds with bioactivity based on the database of BindingDB, ChEBI
and ChEMBLdb. This strategy can help to discovery novel lead com—
pounds and drug molecules. Besides, the negative drug—target inter—
action pair with the same size for positive pairs is used to construct
dataset in order to overcome prediction biases for samples with larger
size. We carry out 10 test, and the statistical results indicate that the
current method is robustness for random sampling of negative sam—
ples. In fact, the amount of negative samples is much higher than that
of positive ones in nature. It is significance to develop novel machine
learning algorithm for overcoming the problem, but it is out of the
scope of the current study. In addition, we do not take into account
the mode of action of the drug molecule due to the little database
now devoted to the collection of data. In future research, we will
solve this problem with the accumulation of relevant data.

Despite possible limitations, we believe that our approach pro—
vides a novel avenue to determine drug—target interaction, helps to
fill the existing gap between chemical proteomics and network
pharmacology, and has an important impact on the mechanism of
action of drugs and targets.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: A proper target or marker is essential in any diagnosis
(e.g. an infection or cancer). An ideal diagnostic target should be both
conserved in and unique to the pathogen. Currently, these targets can
only be identified manually, which is time-consuming and usually
error-prone. Because of the increasingly frequent occurrences of
emerging epidemics and multidrug-resistant ‘superbugs’, a rapid
diagnostic target identiﬁcation process is needed.

Results: A new method that can identify uniquely conserved regions
(UCRs) as candidate diagnostic targets for a selected group of organ-
isms solely from their genomic sequences has been developed and
successfully tested. Using a sequence-indexing algorithm to identify
UCRs and a k—mer integer-mapping model for computational effi-
ciency, this method has successfully identiﬁed UCRs within the
bacteria domain for 15 test groups, including pathogenic, probiotic,
commensal and extremophilic bacterial species or strains. Based on
the identified UCRs, new diagnostic primer sets were designed, and
their speciﬁcity and efficiency were tested by polymerase chain reac-
tion amplifications from both pure isolates and samples containing
mixed cultures.

Availability and implementation: The UCRs identified for the 15 bac-
terial species are now freely available at http://ucr.synblex.com. The

1 INTRODUCTION

Finding the proper target or marker for a speciﬁc disease (e. g. an
infection or cancer) is essential for its successful diagnosis. An
ideal candidate region must be both conserved in and unique
to the speciﬁc target (e.g. a pathogen species or strain), i.e. a
uniquely conserved region, to ensure speciﬁc and effective detec-
tion. Target-speciﬁc nucleic acid diagnostic methods, including
hybridization, ampliﬁcation and sequencing, have been widely
used in academia and in health care, food safety and biosecurity
industries (Caliendo, 2011; Hoorfar, 2012; Miller and Tang,
2009; Morse, 2012; Neuberger et al., 2008; Yang and
Rothman, 2004). Speciﬁc yet sensitive oligonucleotides (probes
or primers) are essential to all of these assays. Current tools, such

as Primer3 (Koressaar and Remm, 2007) and Primer-BLAST
OK e et al., 2012), can only facilitate probe or primer design
when a candidate region is provided, but are not able to identify
these candidate regions by themselves. So far, no existing tools
can identify these candidate regions de novo, and these candidate
targets can only be selected manually, usually based on the
pathogen’s known properties, such as secreted toxins or genes
involved in its pathogenesis (Brakstad et al., 1992; Salo et al.,
1995). This process is time-consuming and usually error-prone,
as the proposed detection primers must be thoroughly examined
to ensure that they are universally present within the targeted
group (e.g. a pathogenic species or strain) and to rule out high
similarity matches in unintended groups. More pressingly,
the number of emerging epidemics and cases with multidrug-
resistant pathogens has continued to increase in recent years
(David and Daum, 2010; Kruse et al., 2013; Mathers et al.,
2012; Newell et al., 2010; Snitkin et al., 2012). Early and accurate
diagnosis is crucial in these cases, which often necessitate a rapid
diagnostic test development. As a result, methods that can auto-
matically identify these candidate regions within a reasonable
time frame and have an affordable cost are desirable.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

For a speciﬁc group of organisms (e.g. a species or strain), the regions
that meet the aforementioned requirements as candidate diagnostic target
regions are referred to as the uniquely conserved regions (UCRs).
Mathematically, UCRs could be deﬁned as a sequence s that is present
in the genome x of each member of the selected group G, and is not
present in the genome y of each member of GC. In the context of a
given domain D (e.g. bacteria), GC = D—G = {ylyeDAy¢ G}. The
set of UCRs for G is denoted as S. For a given G, S may be Q, as
there might not be any UCRs for a group.

|S| has no mathematical upper bound without limiting the length k of
each s, so solving S is intractable in the absence of k bounds. By ﬁxing k,
S could be solved by comparing the occurrence count of every possible
k-mer between G and GC. The problem, thus, has been reduced to ﬁnding
a k-mer u that is present in every genome x in G, but not in any genome y
in GC. All uniquely conserved k-mers could be identiﬁed by ﬁrst indexing
all k-mer occurrences in G and GC separately, and then comparing these
two indexes to screen for those k-mers that meet the deﬁnition, i.e. are
UCR k-mers (Fig. 1A). A region where all k-mers (k above a preset value)
are uniquely conserved is a UCR.

However, the possible k-mer space is vast for typical k-mers commonly
used in primers or probes. Considering only the A, T, C and G four
nucleotides, for a given length k, the total number of k-mers is 4".
Longer k gives better resolution but also means higher computational,
storage and transmission costs. The typical primer length is between 18
and 24 (Dieffenbach et al., 1993). With k set to the lower bound 18, the

(A) The k-mer indexing method for identifying UCRs. The white circle G
stands for the selected group, the gray box without G is GC and G and GC
together is the entire k-mer space (6. g. the k-mer space of the entire bac-
teria domain). The occurrence of each k-mer in G and GC is indexed, and
then the uniquely conserved k-mers of G can be indentiﬁed through com-
parison. (B). The k-mer integer mapping method. Showing k = 6, when
A = 0, C = 1, G = 2, T = 3, following a positional numeral system of
radix 4. The one-to-one mapping between sequence space S and integer
space I is thus established, and S is therefore naturally ordered by the
mapped integer

total space required for a straightforward k-mer occurrence index would
require at least 1.4 TB of space (6.9 x 1010 index length, 18 bytes for
k-mer and 2 bytes for occurrence count). This large size has posed a
serious challenge for both constructing and screening this index, even
for out-of—core (i.e. external memory) algorithms Witter, 2008).

To reduce the space requirement, and to facilitate task partitioning in
parallel computing, a k-mer integer mapping method was used (Fig. 1B).
This method maps each DNA sequence of a ﬁxed length k to a speciﬁc
integer by encoding the nucleotide sequence in a positional numeral
system of radix 4 (i.e. a quaternary numeral system). Let A = 0, C = 1,
G = 2 and T = 3; each DNA sequence of a ﬁxed length k could be con-
verted into a unique integer, allowing straightforward lossless encoding
and decoding. More precisely, for a sequence .9 of (length n) = bn_1. . . b0,
where b, e {A = 0, C = 1, G = 2, T = 3}, the corresponding integer is
3:50),- x 41').

For example, with the above formula, ACGT = 27 and GTCA = 180.
When given k = 4, the integers 27 and 180 could be uniquely decoded as
ACGT and GTCA, respectively. As a result, the position offset within the

occurrence count index was used to implicitly represent the k-mer, which
reduced the space cost by 10-fold. In addition, the entire index could be
partitioned and addressed by the integer order, which greatly simpliﬁed
partitioning and aggregation in parallelization. Additional steps were also
included to consider the reverse complement sequence of a k-mer, and the
k-mers spanning the break points of the circular bacterial nuclear
genomes.

After identifying all UCR k-mers for a group, the UCRs were
assembled from these UCR k-mers. The UCR k-mer distribution
among genes (or genomic regions) was then calculated against a known
reference genome annotation. Primers were picked from a gene or region
that contains the largest amount of UCRs with the highest density but
avoids common household genes across the bacterial domain. These pri-
mers were then screened for appropriate product size (0.6 ~ 1 kb), a neu-
tral GC% (46%~54%), the presence of a 3’-GC clamp, a compatible
melting temperature between forward and reverse primer pairs and min-
imal heterodimer/homodimer AGs. Finally, as for any UCR k-mer, the
(k— i)-mers (0 < i < k— 1) contained within do not necessarily and often do
not meet the UCR deﬁnition, all remaining candidate primers were
screened against the NCBI nucleotide database to further remove those
with high similarity matches in unintended groups, especially close to the
3’ end.

The complete source code for building a background k-mer index,
UCR identiﬁcation and primer selection is provided at http://ucr.syn
blex.com/bacterialIdSourceCode.d.zip. After formatting the sequence
source (e.g. the entire collection of bacterial genomes from NCBI) with
the included formatter, the background k-mer occurrence array could be
computed using the BacterialIDkMerIndexBlockBuilder. This Builder
can run on machines with as little as 2 GB RAM. A partition information
tool for parallel computing and a k-mer space distribution analysis tool
were also provided. After gathering all of the genomes for a particular
group, the conserved k-mer occurrence index for this given group could
be computed with the included Finder and Counter utilities. Finally, a
tool (UniquelyConservedeerFinder) compares the group’s index
against the background index to ﬁnd UCR k-mers. Additional scripts
were provided to analyze the genome distribution and annotation infor-
mation of the identiﬁed UCR k-mers and UCRs as well as screening for
optimal primers.

3 RESULTS

A total of 2717 bacterial genomes were obtained from the NCBI
nucleotide database in December 2013. Because of the high prob-
ability of horizontal gene transfer for plasmids, only genomic
DNA was included. The k—mer length was selected as 18,
which can produce UCR k—mers that may be directly used as
primers while at the same time maintaining a manageable index
size (6.9 x 1010). The background 18-mer occurrence index was
computed, costing ~200 CPU-h (2.4 GHz), and the total uncom-
pressed size was 137 GB. These 18-mer occurrences were largely
uniformly distributed across the mapped integer space. Close to
90% of the 18-mers did not exist in the known bacterial gen-
omes, and among those that did exist, only >90% had no more
than ﬁve occurrences (Fig. 2). This indicates that the bacterial
18-mer space is unsaturated, which means that there are many
potential UCR 18-mers.

gens (Streptococcus equi), one commonly found commensal bac-
terium in ruminants and also a human pathogen (Streptococcus

philes (Sulfolobus islandicus, T hermus thermophilus) and one
cyanobacterium and also a model organism (Synechocystis
PCC 6803) (Table 1).

3.2 Association between UCR distribution and bacterial
lifestyle

The composition of the genes containing the most identiﬁed
UCR 18-mers has an obvious correlation with group’s lifestyle/
characteristics (Table 2, and further details in Supplementary
Table S1—S15). The groups that need to interact with host
immune systems tend to have membrane/ surface proteins that
contain the most UCR 18-mers, while free-living groups tend
to have housekeeping genes, such as metabolism and expres-
sion-related genes, containing the most UCR 18-mers. For ex-
ample, 80% of the top 10 genes that contain the most UCR 18-
mers are membrane/surface proteins in the C.trach0matis group,
an obligate intracellular pathogen. In contrast, 60% of the top 10
genes in the T. thermophilus group are metabolism-related and
80% are in the Pﬂuorescens group. Other genes that frequently
contain the most UCR 18-mers are RNA polymerases (e. g. rpo)
and DNA polymerases (e.g. pol). Probiotic bacterial groups,
whose top 10 genes contain both housekeeping genes and mem-
brane proteins, need to interact with the host immune systems
but do not require a host to survive. As a result, the UCR k-mer

3.3 Selection and validation of UCR detection primers

Previously, most detection primers and targets were selected
based on known properties of the pathogen, such as secreted
toxins or genes involved in its pathogenesis. For example, the
ply gene of the pneumolysin toxin was selected as the detection
target for the pathogenic bacteria Streptococcus pneumoniae for
its involvement in pneumococcal infections and interference with
host immune response (Salo et al., 1995). Similarly, the nuc gene
of the extracellular thermostable nuclease was selected as the
target for S.aureus (Brakstad et al., 1992). And also the two
primer sets that were designed speciﬁcally for the Shiga toxin 1
(sth) and Shiga toxin 2 (stx2) genes of the E.c0li 0157:H7
(Fratamico et al., 2000). Such primers were widely used; how-
ever, whether these primer sets met the requirements as an ideal
detection target (i.e. ﬁrst, conserved in, and second, unique to the
speciﬁc pathogen species or group) were not examined when they
were ﬁrst proposed. It is therefore interesting to test whether
these primer sets meet these requirements, especially now that
there is a large number of available bacterial genomes. For the
S.pneum0niae primer set (Salo et al., 1995), 97% of the available
S.pneum0niae genomes contain the exact match of the primer
sequences. However, for the widely used S.aureus primer set
(Brakstad et al., 1992), 15% of genomes have mismatches
within the ﬁve nucleotides relative to the 3’ terminus of the for-
ward primer. Additionally, the sth primer set has only signiﬁ-
cant matches in 50% of the E.c0li 0157:H7 genomes, and both
sth and stx2 primers have signiﬁcant matches even in species
other than E.c0li.

As a result, the UCR k-mer approach could help to reﬁne
the target selection and improve primer speciﬁcity and efﬁciency
by systematically satisfying the detection target requirement

through conditions built into the algorithm (i.e. making sure that
the primer sequences are ﬁrst, conserved in, and second, unique
to the speciﬁc pathogen species or group). With this method,
based on the identiﬁed UCR 18-mers, detection primers were
selected for 14 of the 15 groups (Table 3). These primers also
met additional requirements that facilitate ampliﬁcation and de-
tection (e.g. having 0.6~1 kb product size, 46~54% GC%,

3’ GC clamps, <3°C melting temperature differences between
forward and reverse primer pairs and <10kcal/mole heterodi-
mer/homodimer AGs). There are many primer sets satisfying
these requirements from within the UCRs for each genome,
and one random set for each genome was chosen. The identiﬁed
UCR k-mers for the Pﬂuorescens were too few in number and
too far apart to produce any usable primers.

as successful detections. These eight primer sets were able to
speciﬁcally target the intended strain, even from samples contain-
ing multiple bacterial species and non-bacterial organisms.

4 DISCUSSION

The UCR identiﬁcation method described here was able to suc-
cessfully and automatically, with reasonable efﬁciency, identify
regions that are both conserved in and unique to a selected bac-
terial group (a species or strain) solely based on their genomic
sequences. These regions are by deﬁnition ideal diagnostic targets
for nucleic acid hybridization, ampliﬁcation and/ or sequencing.
Although high-throughput sequencing has been used in major
medical centers to identify and track emerging epidemics and
multidrug-resistant bacterial infections (Snitkin et al., 2012),
most medical facilities and reference laboratories lack the neces-
sary equipment or personnel to take full advantage of these latest
technologies. However, with this method, effective and accurate
nucleic acid diagnostic targets could be rapidly identiﬁed from
the data generated at those major medical centers or government
agencies, and can be quickly adopted by most hospitals and
laboratories with existing procedures such as PCR.

A method for de novo nucleic acid diagnostic target discovery

 

The UCRs identiﬁed for the 15 bacterial species are now freely
available at http://ucr.synblex.com. The source code of the pro-
grams used in this study is accessible at http://ucr.synblex.com/
bacterialIdSourceCode.d.zip, while an automated pipeline for
diagnostic target and primer selection is under development.
Hopefully, this new method could rapidly and efﬁciently gener-
ate diagnostic targets that are both speciﬁc and sensitive,
and ultimately lead to improved bacterial infectious disease
management.

4.1 Intended usage and known limitations

A group must be clearly identiﬁed before the application of this
method. Therefore, this method provides a possibility for large
clinical testing centers, pharmaceutical companies and research
laboratories to identify more efﬁcient diagnostic markers, PCR
primers and other products in managing bacterial infec-
tions caused by a known group of bacteria. Additionally, this
method might also provide insights for the discovery of the mar-
kers of an unknown bacterial infectious agent present in patients
with shared symptoms but without a clinically known disease,
for example, by identifying UCRs in assembled patient micro-
biome data.

One signiﬁcant drawback of this method is that it requires at
least a few available genomes within a group to select UCRs and
UCR primers. If only one or two genomes are available to rep-
resent a group, the properties of the generated UCRs and UCR
primers are usually violated. However, the number of available
genomes has increased signiﬁcantly and is continuing to rise,
which might be able to alleviate the impact of this drawback.

Additionally, as with any laboratory testing procedures, a test
result only provides one piece of information on which the
health-care providers make a diagnosis. Furthermore, it is
known that pathogenic strains might be present asymptomati-
cally within some individuals (e.g. silent carriers), while some
environmental bacteria might cause severe infections in individ-
uals with a compromised immune system. As a result, it is worth
reiterating that the presence of a pathogenic strain might not
immediately equate clinical symptoms, although such a discovery
could provide valuable information about infectious disease dis-
persion and transmission. In contrast, the absence of all known
pathogens, opportunistic or otherwise, is not evidence of an
absence of bacterial infection. Therefore, in the latter cases,
where infection symptoms are obvious, appropriate antibiotic
treatment should be provided at the health-care providers’ dis-
cretion, especially to individuals with known immunodeﬁciency.

4.2 Applicability on partially assembled genomes and
limitations with raw sequencing reads

This method could be used on partially assembled genomes.
However, due to its principle and how the raw sequencing
reads were currently generated, this method should not be used
on raw sequence data when building the background k-mer
index. Currently, on most NGS-sequencing platforms (e. g.
Illumina, Ion Torrent, 454, etc.), the error rate for each single
raw read is relatively high. Only through combining multiple raw
reads together at the same location through mapping or de novo
assembly could a reasonably reliable sequence be achieved.
Although error-containing k-mers are unlikely to become

conserved within a group, this only ensures that one of the
UCR conditions (i.e. conserved in a speciﬁc group) is not vio-
lated. When the background k—mer index is built, and if raw
sequencing reads are allowed, these error-containing k-mers
will be calculated in the background k—mer index.
Subsequently, a random match between a true UCR k-mer for
one group and an error-containing k—mer from another group
would automatically rule out this true UCR k—mer in the selec-
tion process, as this by deﬁnition violates the other UCR condi-
tion (i.e. unique to a speciﬁc group). Currently, with billions of
reads generated for each experiment, a mere 3% error-containing
reads could still yield millions of error-containing k-mers, which
would create a substantial amount of noise in the background
k-mer index, and therefore, limit this method’s selection power
for k-mers unique to a given group. As a result, raw sequencing
reads should not be used in the process of building the back-
ground k-mer index. In contrast, if the background index has
already been built with completed genomes, and multiple sam-
ples of a new group were sequenced, UCR k-mers could be
identiﬁed directly from the raw sequencing reads with this
method. This will be a major functionality in the future release
of the fully automated pipeline.

Although partially assembled genomes contain gaps, the error
rate for each contig has been reduced to an acceptable level
through at least one round of assembly. The gaps (or break
points) between contigs will prevent the sequences spanning
these gaps from being indexed, and thus, the sequence informa-
tion close to the gaps would be lost. However, a routine micro-
bial genome sequencing project would typically generate no more
than 50—100 large contigs, and these 50—100 gaps represent only
a limited amount of lost information, especially when the k-mer
length is several orders shorter than that of a contig.

4.3 UCRs as a concise reference database in microbiome
screening

In a typical microbiome screening, one key step in the analysis
pipeline is to identify the sources of the sequences within the
sample, usually by comparing these sequences against reference
databases. For example, for a metagenomic screening with 16S
amplicons, the raw reads could be compared against popular
databases such as Silva (Quast et al., 2012), RDP (Cole et al.,
2013) or Greengenes (McDonald et al., 2011). For a typical
WGS metagenomic screening, the raw reads could be directly
compared against all known genomes or the NCBI nr/nt data-
bases. This UCR method is capable of identifying regions that
can serve as markers for some of the known bacterial species, as
demonstrated in this study. If UCRs could be identiﬁed for most
clinically relevant species and/ or strains, and with these UCRs as
a concise reference database, a routine clinical analysis would
only need to compare each raw metagenomic read with the rela-
tively few number of identiﬁed UCRs instead of the entire
known collection of genomes or the NCBI nr/nt databases. As
a result, in theory, the computational cost could be drastically
reduced.

However, as mentioned earlier, without considering contam-
ination and other human errors, the instrument error rate at the
raw sequencing read level is relatively high. A match between a
UCR and a raw sequencing read might be owing to such errors.

Therefore, as in any NGS analyses involving raw reads, only
after observing a signiﬁcant amount of matched raw reads for
a given UCR, i.e. achieving a certain coverage threshold, could
one conﬁdently conclude the presence of the organism associated
with this UCR. Additionally, the fact that only a tiny percentage
of organisms have sequenced genomes dictates that UCRs can
only be calculated for a limited number of species or groups. As a
result, using UCRs as a reference database might be able to
drastically reduce computational time, but this is appropriate
when only known organisms (e.g. pathogens) are of interest in
a microbiome study, such as a routine clinical screening. In other
scientiﬁc studies, where the information from the previously un-
known species is of equal interest, the UCR reference database is
of limited usefulness.

4.4 Protein versus nucleic acid space k-mer indexing

Although a bacterial genome is mostly protein coding, and the
capacity of 8-mer peptide (2.6 x 1010 index length) is comparable
with that of the 18-mer DNA/RNA sequence, due to codon de-
generacy, and therefore, the existence of synonymous mutations,
protein sequences are more conserved than DNA sequences be-
tween species. As a result, traditionally, intraspeciﬁc studies and
studies involving closely related species usually use nucleotide
sequences, as they have a higher observable substitution rate,
and hence, higher resolution for short evolutionary distances.
In contrast, studies involving long evolutionary processes (e.g.
over millions of years), usually use protein sequences, as their
relatively low substitution rate retains alignable sequence pat-
terns better and is less prone to the effect of multiple hits over
a long evolutionary process. With the purpose being identifying
diagnostic markers that are capable of differentiating between
species or strains, nucleic acid sequence markers are more appro-
priate. However, for other genomes with an extremely high mu-
tation rate (e. g. viral genomes), nucleic acid UCRs might not be
feasible because of the higher intraspeciﬁc/interstrain differences.
In this case, peptide UCRs would be more appropriate, as their
protein sequences are more conserved.

4.5 Possibilities and limitations beyond bacterial genomes

This method was demonstrated with bacterial genomes.
Theoretically, this method could also be applicable in eukary-
otes. However, the limited number of available genomes within
a eukaryotic species has severely restricted applicability. For
example, even with the 1000 Fungal Genome Project, there are
currently <200 publically available fungal genomes, and on aver-
age, there is only one complete genome for each fungal species.
Without a substantial number of genomes sampled for each spe-
cies or strain, there would not be any conservation information
for a given group, nor would there be a robust background
k-mer index. With an increasingly faster genome generation
rate, and more and more completed fungal genomes, it is
hoped that this limitation could soon be addressed.

Although close to 2000 viral genomes have been published, the
application on viruses is more challenging. Because of their high
mutation rate, and the resulting low sequence similarity between
genomes within the same viral species, we have failed to identify any
viral nucleic acid UCRs on a species level (with k> 15). Instead,
peptide UCRs might be possible and more appropriate. The same

algorithm could be adapted to index and screen for uniquely con-
served peptide sequences, but validating the results would be
signiﬁcantly more challenging, and viral processing and protein
sequencing are beyond the capability of this research group.

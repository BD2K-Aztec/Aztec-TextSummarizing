ABSTRACT

The ISMB Special Interest Group on Linking Literature, Information
and Knowledge for Biology (BioLINK) organized a one-day workshop
at ISMB/ECCB 2013 in Berlin, Germany. The theme of the workshop
was ‘Roles for text mining in biomedical knowledge discovery and
translational medicine’. This summary reviews the outcomes of the
workshop. Meeting themes included concept annotation methods
and applications, extraction of biological relationships and the use of
text-mined data for biological data analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the increasing availability of text data related to biology
and medicine in the scientiﬁc literature, database annotations,
the electronic health record, clinical trials data and health infor-
mation online, exciting opportunities arise to provide access to
pertinent biomedical information and to advance biomedical
knowledge. An evolving research direction is the integration
of information from diverse data sources, including textual
data, to support deeper understanding of biological systems,
the genomic basis of disease and genotype—phenotype relation-
ships. During the BioLINK SIG 2013 meeting, we explored the
current state of the ﬁeld with respect to information extraction
from the wealth of available textual sources and application
areas where text mining is deployed to support biological data
analysis.

2 MEETING THEMES

2.1 Concept annotation methods and applications

Many text-mining systems incorporate annotation of core con-
cepts such as genes, diseases and Gene Ontology (GO) terms
(Ashburner et al., 2000) as a fundamental component. We
learned about several case studies making use of a patient-feature
matrix derived from the application of the NCBO annotator tool
(Shah et al., 2009) to clinical text (Pendu et al., 2013) to answer
speciﬁc biomedical questions. The workshop also included pres-
entations aimed at improved biomedical concept recognition:

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Neji (Campos et al., 2013) is an open-source framework address-
ing annotation of a range of biomedical concept categories, and
t4rgot (Jacob et al., 2013) is a method targeted speciﬁcally at GO
terms.

The source of concept annotations was also discussed. The
presentation by Bada et al. (2013), which examined manual an-
notations of GO concepts speciﬁcally relevant to biocuration,
highlighted the potential role of key evidential sentences in auto-
matically identifying GO concepts that are likely to lead to
curated gene or gene product annotations. Jimeno and
Verspoor (2013) identify text mining of supplementary material
in addition to narrative text as critical for ﬁnding information on
genetic variants.

Several posters introduced applications making available con-
cept annotations over text. The PubAnnotation tool supports
sharing and interoperability of annotations over the biomedical
literature (Kim, 2013). The Biotea system provides annotations
over PubMed in terms of a Resource Description Framework
(RDF) model (Garcia et al., 2013a). PDFJailbreak (Garcia
et al., 2013b) provides a framework for direct semantic annotation
of PDF ﬁles.

2.2 Extraction of biological relationships

Beyond recognition of biological entities and concept terms,
there is a signiﬁcant interest in extracting biological events, e. g.
interactions involving multiple entities or entity components.
This involves modeling of myriad linguistic realizations of a
given event type, and typically uses either high-precision linguis-
tic patterns (Cohen et al. 2011; Kilicoglu and Bergler, 2012) or
machinelearning techniques (Kim et al., 2012; Bjorne et al.,
2012). Verbs play an important role in connecting entities in
event descriptions; Roberts (Roberts, 2013) explored differences
in the lexical semantic patterns of causal verbs as compared with
associative verbs. The SIG also included research aiming to
extract some relatively underexplored event types: transcription
regulation events, including biologically relevant context, such as
experimental conditions and host tissue (Leitner, 2013), histone
modiﬁcation (Thomas and Leser, 2013) and the expression of
particular genes in particular cells for the CellFinder database
(Neves et al., 2013). In addition, a poster was presented describ-
ing initial efforts to produce Biological Expression Language
(http://www.openbel.org) statements using text mining (Liu
et al., 2013).

2.3 Use of text-mined data for biological data analysis

Our keynote speaker, Lars Juhl Jensen, presented his work on
‘pragmatic’ text mining of clinical records (Jensen et al., 2012) as
well as the biomedical literature (Jensen et al., 2006), in which he
highlighted the important role that text mining can play in bio-
medical applications when it enables large-scale identiﬁcation of
concept co-occurrences. Mining of such relationships among
entities can identify signiﬁcant hidden associations.

Kissa et al. developed a novel relatedness measure for chem-
ical compounds, which integrates a text-based similarity meas-
ure for nominal features (terms from a controlled vocabulary)
or free text ﬁelds (Kissa et al., 2013). Hettne et al. explore the
use of background knowledge in pathway databases and litera-
ture to make sense of single nucleotide polymorphism —metabol-
ite pairs from genome-wide association studies (Hettne et al.,
2013).

Two contributions to the workshop addressed the interplay
between text and structured knowledge resources, from distinct
perspectives: Kim and Cohen (Kim and Cohen, 2013) propose a
natural language-based query interface to an underlying struc-
tured resources, whereas Garcia et al. (2013c) propose aggrega-
tion of context extracted from multiple documents into problem-
dependent self-describing research objects.

3 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE OUTLOOK

Textual sources such as clinical text and the biomedical literature
are rich sources of knowledge, and text-mining tools aim to ex-
tract and structure that knowledge. The diversity of topics in the
BioLINK SIG 2013 reﬂects a ﬁeld in transition: the increasing
availability of concept annotations, alongside the increasing
speciﬁcity and complexity of events being tackled for relation
extraction, are making possible the use of text-mined data in
problems where the primary objective is understanding a biolo-
gical mechanism or a clinical relationship. We anticipate seeing
text mining play an increasing role in translational bioinfor-
matics and systems biology models.

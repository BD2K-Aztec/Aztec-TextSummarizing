ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-Seq (also called whole-transcriptome sequencing) is
an emerging technology that uses the capabilities of next-generation
sequencing to detect and quantify entire transcripts. One of its import-
ant applications is the improvement of existing genome annotations.
RNA-Seq provides rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective tools
for the discovery of novel genes and transcripts compared with ex-
pressed sequence tag (EST), which is instrumental in gene discovery
and gene sequence determination. The rat is widely used as a labora-
tory disease model, but has a less well-annotated genome as com-
pared with humans and mice. In this study, we incorporated deep
RNA-Seq data from three rat tissues—bone marrow, brain and
kidney—with EST data to improve the annotation of the rat genome.
Results: Our analysis identified 32197 transcripts, including 13461
known transcripts, 13934 novel isoforms and 4802 new genes,
which almost doubled the numbers of transcripts in the current
public rat genome database (rn5). Comparisons of our predicted
protein-coding gene sets with those in public datasets suggest that
RNA-Seq significantly improves genome annotation and identifies
novel genes and isoforms in the rat. Importantly, the large majority
of novel genes and isoforms are supported by direct evidence
of RNA-Seq experiments. These predicted genes were integrated
into the Rat Genome Database (RGD) and can serve as an important
resource for functional studies in the research community.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rat, Rattus norvegicus, is the ﬁrst mammalian species to be
domesticated for scientiﬁc research, with work dating back >150

years (Lindsey, 1979). The rat has become a widely used disease
model in the ﬁelds of physiology, pharmacology, toxicology,
nutrition, behavior and immunology (Aitman et al., 2008). The
genome sequence of the Brown Norway (BN) rat strain is the
third completed mammalian genome after the human and mouse
genomes (Atanur et al., 2013; Gibbs et al., 2004); however, its
genome annotation has progressed slowly. Genome annotation is
the process of attaching biological information to sequences
(Stein, 2001). One of the most important steps of genome anno-
tation is to ﬁnd regions of genomic sequence that encode genes.
This includes annotation of protein-coding genes and RNA
genes, such as microRNAs, small nucleolar RNA and long
non-coding RNA. In this article, we focused on improving
annotation of protein-coding genes in the rat. Compared with
the human and mouse genomes, the current build of rat gen-
ome rn5 is considerably less comprehensive. As of November
2013, the human build hgl9 annotated 37 556 mRNAs and
18667 consensus protein-coding genes, and the mouse build
mm10 annotated 28 646 mRNAs and 19962 genes. These are
compared with 17938 mRNAs and 16744 genes in the rat
build rn5.

Existing annotation methods fall into two groups according to
the type of data used for gene discovery (Stanke et al., 2006a).
The ﬁrst group consists of ab initio programs, which are intrinsic
methods based on gene content and signal detection (Mathé
et al., 2002). All the programs in this group use only queried
genomic sequences as input for gene discovery. The second
group is composed of extrinsic methods, which comprise all pro-
grams that use data such as cDNA or protein other than the
query genomic sequence to improve the accuracy of gene ﬁnding
(Atanur et al., 2013). A few programs, such as AUGUSTUS
(Stanke et al., 2006b), combine extrinsic and ab initio approaches
by mapping protein and expressed sequence tag (EST) data to
the genome to validate ab initio predictions (Stanke et al., 2006b).
AUGUSTUS is one of the most accurate programs for gene
discovery due, in large part, to its ability to incorporate multiple
‘hints’ into gene prediction models, making it a ﬂexible program
capable of using information from various sources. These hints
are pieces of extrinsic evidence, which includes the location of
exons, introns and biological signals of a given input DNA

sequence and can be retrieved from EST, RNA-Seq and other
data sources.

ESTs are short subsequences of a cDNA library, and are one
source of extrinsic data. They are an enormous resource for
determining the exon—intron structures of genes. However,
ESTs are often incomplete and only reﬂect small pieces of full
mRNAs (Mathé et al., 2002). RNA-Seq (also called whole-
transcriptome sequencing) is a recently emerging technology
that uses the capabilities of next-generation sequencing to
detect and quantify entire transcripts. This technology is a
more rapid, comprehensive and cost-effective approach in the
discovery of novel genes and transcripts compared with EST
data from conventional Sanger sequencing (Roberts et al.,
2011). RNA-Seq mapping of short reads in exon junctions can
reveal the precise location of exon/intron boundaries, to a single-
nucleotide resolution (\Nang et al., 2009), and thus has the
potential to signiﬁcantly improve existing genome annotations
(Denoeud et al., 2008). Moreover, because a larger number
of reads can be obtained with deep sequencing, RNA-Seq
has the sensitivity to detect transcripts for genes with low expres-
sion levels, which are often missed by EST analysis (Denoeud
et al., 2008).

In this study, we developed an analysis pipeline in which
we incorporate high-throughput RNA-Seq data from three
rat tissues (kidney, brain and bone marrow) into a gene pre-
diction model based on the AUGUSTUS algorithm (Fig. 1).
We compared our predicted protein-coding gene sets with
public datasets and found that RNA-Seq signiﬁcantly improved
genome annotation and identiﬁed novel genes and gene iso-
forms in the rat. These predicted genes were deposited into
the RGD (http://rgd.mcw.edu) (Supplementary Fig. S1) and
may serve as an important resource for the research
community.

2 METHODS AND MATERIALS
2.1 RNA-Seq experiments

Tissues from bone marrow, brain and kidney were harvested
from BN or Sprague Dawley (SS) rats or rats with a mixed
genetic background of BN and SS (Supplementary Table S1).
This allowed the identiﬁcation of new loci, alternatively spliced
isoforms and tissue-speciﬁc exons (in known loci). mRNA from
these tissues was sequenced using the Illumina HiSeq 2000
Sequencing system with 100 bp paired-end reads. RNA-Seq li-
brary preparation and sequencing were previously described
(Kaczorowski et al., 2013).

Before data analysis, raw sequences with low quality (base
quality< 13) at both read ends were trimmed, and any reads
<25 bp were removed. Reads were aligned to the rat reference
genome (rn5) with TopHat v2.0.0 (Trapnell et al., 2009). Each
alignment was assigned a mapping quality score by TopHat,
which is the Phred-scaled probability that the alignment is incor-
rect. Only reads with mapping quality >1 are retained for the
analysis. Aligned sequence ﬁles in BAM format were subse-
quently used for generating extrinsic evidence for the location
and the structure of genes.

2.2 Predicting protein-coding genes

To predict protein-coding genes, we generated two types of
extrinsic transcribed evidence (i.e. hints) that are extracted
from EST and RNA-Seq. Rat EST sequences were downloaded
from the UCSC genome database (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.
edu/goldenPath/rn5/bigZips/). The EST sequences were then
aligned to the rat genome using the Blat program (Kent, 2002)
to generate intron and exon hints. The BAM ﬁles from RNA-
Seq contain information on the junction structure of exons and
introns. The intron and exonpart hints were extracted from the
BAM ﬁles using the bam2hints module in AUGUSTUS (Stanke
et al., 2006a). These RNA-Seq hints were generated for bone
marrow, brain and kidney tissues separately. Then, each hint
was used for protein-coding gene prediction, implemented in
AUGUSTUS. To evaluate the impact of integration of EST
with RNA-Seq on genome annotation, the hints from EST and
RNA-Seq were further combined (i.e. EST_RNASeq) and used
for subsequent gene prediction (Fig. 1).

After gene prediction, we evaluated whether the identiﬁed un-
translated regions (UTRs) are transcripted and further extended
UTRs to adjacent regions that are transcribed using RNA-Seq
data. UTRs whose values of reads per kilobase per million
mapped reads (RPKM) are at least 90% of their corresponding
protein-coding sequence (CDS) are considered as transcribed
UTRs. To extend the UTRs to adjacent transcribed regions,
we ﬁrst used the Cufﬂinks program (Trapnell et al., 2010) to
construct transcripts/exons from RNA-Seq reads. Then, we
checked whether the upstream (i.e. 5’UTR, immediately before
start codon) and the downstream (i.e. 3’UTR, immediately after
stop codon) of AUGUSTUS-predicted genes are transcribed
based on their RPKM values. The UTR could then be further
extended to adjacent exons if there were a minimum three sup-
porting reads spanning between the new exon and the exon
containing the start or stop codon. Using the above strategy,
the UTRs could be extended to further adjacent exons. The

Improved rat genome gene prediction

 

same RPKM thresholds were applied to these newly included
exons.

2.3 Filtering protein-coding genes

To more accurately identify transcripts and genes, we ﬁltered
results from AUGUSTUS by considering their phylogenetic con-
servation across species and homology with known genes and
transcripts. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst downloaded human (hgl9) and
mouse (mm10) gene annotation data from the UCSC genome
database. To obtain orthologous homology, we used the UCSC
liftOver utility (http://hgdownload.soe.ucsc.edu) to convert
genome coordinates and genome annotations from hgl9 to rn5
and from mm10 to rn5. Then, we ﬁltered AUGUSTUS-
predicted genes with <80% of orthologous homology to either
mouse or human. After ﬁltering, the transcripts predicted from
RNA-Seq and EST_RNASeq were combined in each tissue
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.4 Comparing the newly predicted protein-coding genes
with rat RefSeq genes

After ﬁltering, we evaluated the coverage and quality of pre-
dicted transcripts and genes in each of the three rat tissues
based on rat RefSeq genes (m5) as a reference set. As the current
RefSeq gene annotation is not complete, we deﬁned transcripts
that show at least 95% similarity in protein-coding regions to the
rat RefSeq transcripts as known transcripts, genes/transcripts
that do not show any overlap with the rat RefSeq database
as novel transcripts and the remaining as novel isoforms.
Finally, transcripts predicted from various resources and tissues
were integrated and combined with genomic annotation to gen-
erate a list of consensus gene prediction models (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

2.5 Evaluating retained and/0r excluded exons in
transcript isoforms

In general, if multiple transcript isoforms exist in the same tissue,
these retained or excluded exons lead to unbalanced reads
mapped in neighboring exons. To examine these unbalanced
reads, we used the module ‘pileup’ in the samtools tool
(Li et al., 2009) to extract reads at each positions within retained
or excluded exons and their neighboring exons. We then used
two-sample t—test statistics to evaluate the difference in read
counts between retained or excluded exons and their neighboring
exons. The Benjamini—Hochberg method was used to control
false discovery rate (FDR) in the multiple testing procedures
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Sequence depth of RNA-Seq

To detect transcripts for genes with low expression levels, we
combined RNA-Seq reads from different replicates and different
experimental conditions from the same tissues (Supplementary
Table S1). As a result, we obtained 369 million Illumina HiSeq
2000 RNA-Seq reads from six libraries of bone marrow, 600
million reads from 12 libraries of brain and 1372 million reads
from 12 libraries of kidney. More than 88% of these reads could

be mapped unambiguously with TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009)
to the rat genome (rn5) and intron and exon junctions. Such a
high depth of sequence coverage in our study allowed for the
detection of extremely low-expressed transcripts with RPKM as
low as 0.01 in each rat tissue (Trapnell et al., 2010).

3.2 New rat genome annotation with RNA-Seq data

By incorporating EST information with RNA-Seq data from
bone marrow into gene prediction models, we annotated 16 834
transcripts, including 8857 known transcripts, 5937 novel iso-
forms (within known genes) and 2040 new genes, that show no
overlaps with any genes in the public rat genome database (rn5).
Similarly, we annotated 17883 transcripts in brain, including
9571 known transcripts, 6221 novel isoforms and 2091 new
genes, and 17076 transcripts in kidney, including 8623 known
transcripts, 6245 novel isoforms and 2208 new genes (Fig. 2,
Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary Table S2). The ana-
lysis using the combined hints from EST and RNA-Seq (i.e.
EST_RNASeq) yielded 10%, 8% and 4% more transcripts
than that using RNA-Seq hints alone in bone marrow, brain
and kidney, respectively. Interestingly, >25% novel isoforms
and gene transcripts were uniquely identiﬁed by the analysis
using hints either from RNA-Seq or from EST_RNASeq.
Among novel isoforms, ~50% tend to have new start or stop
codons (Supplementary Table S3). About one-third of these
transcripts are expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc manner

(Supplementary Fig. S4). When combining transcripts from the
three tissues, we identiﬁed 32197 transcripts, including 13 461
known transcripts, 13 934 novel isoforms and 4802 new genes,
which had 13 349 loci overlapping with the rat genome. In com-
parison, the public rat genome database (rn5) contains 17938
transcripts that span 16 744 loci on the rat genome.

Approximately 80% of AUGUSTUS-predicted genes have
transcribed UTRs that are supported by RNA-Seq reads. The
predicted UTR sizes are similar between the analyses using hints
from RNA-Seq and EST_RNASeq, whereas the UTR sizes vary
among the three different tissues. Bone marrow and brain tend to
have smaller UTRs than kidney. The predicted 5’UTRs from our
analyses are, on average, two times larger than those of the rat
RefSeq database (rn5) (271 versus 139 bp). The predicted
3’UTRs in the bone marrow are smaller than those of RefSeq,
whereas 3’UTRs in the other two tissues are larger than those
of RefSeq (Supplementary Table S4).

3.3 Improving protein-coding gene prediction

There are several improvements in the rat genome annotation
resulting from incorporation of EST and RNA-Seq data into
gene prediction models. First, our analysis predicted longer and
more complete transcripts compared with the public database. In
bone marrow, each transcript has a mean of 14 protein-coding
exons and an average of 2108 bp of coding sequence. Similar stat-
istics on gene structures were observed in brain and kidney. This is
in comparison with a mean of nine protein-coding exons and an
average of 1520 bp of coding sequences in the rat RefSeq tran-
script (Table l). For example, wad2 is a RING ﬁnger gene on rat
chromosome 13, which is a major candidate gene responsible for
the development of salt-sensitive hypertension in SS rats (Moreno
et al., 2011). The full-length transcript of wad2 in the rat RefSeq
(rn5) has 13 coding exons, which contain only the WD2 repeat
domain and lack the RING ﬁnger domain. However, the newly
predicted wad2 has 20 coding exons and contains both RING
ﬁnger and WD2 repeat domains. The gene structure of our pre-
dicted wad2 in rat is more homologous to the same gene in
mouse, human and other species (Fig. 3A).

In addition, the analysis identiﬁed more isoforms at each
gene locus compared with the public database. Our prediction
yielded a median of two transcripts per gene, whereas the rat
RefSeq database has a median of one transcript per gene. For
example, Ccnt2 (cyclin T2) encodes for an immunoglobulin—like

Table 1. Basic characteristics of predicted protein-coding genes

domain-containing receptor. Our analysis identiﬁed a novel iso-
form of the full-length Ccnt2 gene, which is expressed in all of the
three tissues, and is similar to the homologous gene in human,
mouse and other species (Fig. 3B).

3.4 Identifying novel genes and isoforms

Another major advantage of our gene prediction analyses is the
discovery of novel genes and isoforms. In our analysis of bone
marrow, we identiﬁed 2040 novel loci that show no overlap with
protein-coding genes in the public rat RefSeq database, and 5937
transcripts that are novel splice isoforms (Fig. 2). Similarly, we
identiﬁed 2091 novel genes and 6221 novel isoforms in brain, and
2208 novel genes and 6245 novel isoforms in kidney.

We compared the characteristics of these novel genes with
known genes that are presented in the public rat RefSeq data-
base. We observed that our predicted novel genes had larger
CDS size and more isoforms per gene than the known genes in
RefSeq detected by the same analysis pipeline (Supplementary
Table S5). In addition, novel genes predicted by our analysis tend
to be expressed at lower levels than the known genes that overlap
the public rat RefSeq database (Fig. 4). This may in part explain
the reason why some of these new loci are not present in the
public database.

We searched for alternative sources of evidence for these novel
genes in addition to our sequencing and analyses. Among the
novel genes we discovered, 719 are supported by RNA-Seq reads
only, 69 are supported by EST only, 3965 are supported by
both RNA-Seq reads and EST sequences and 115 are predicted
ab initio from genomic sequences (Fig. 5). For example, Rbm27
(RNA-binding motif protein 27) encodes for a gene with a
C3Hl-type zinc ﬁnger and an RNA recognition motif domain.
Our analysis identiﬁed Rbm27 as a novel gene on rat chromo-
some 18 that was not previously annotated in the public database
(m5). This is supported not only by our RNA-Seq data but also
by homologous proteins in mouse and human (Fig. 6A).

We further investigated transcript evidence for these novel
isoforms. If there is only one isoform for a full-length gene
locus presented in a speciﬁc tissue, we directly checked whether
the retained or excluded exons identiﬁed in the novel isoforms
were supported by RNA-Seq or EST reads. As a result, 1017 of
the 1088 exons that were either retained or excluded in novel
isoforms show transcript evidence in RNA-Seq and/or EST
data (Fig. 7A). If multiple transcript isoforms exist in the

same tissue, these retained or excluded exons generally lead to
unbalanced reads mapped in their neighboring exons. We thus
examined whether RNA-Seq reads were disproportionally
mapped in retained or excluded exons and their neighboring
exons. Interestingly, 12733 of the 12846 exons reveal evidence
for alternative splicing (FDR <0.05) (Fig. 7B). For example,
myocyte enhancer factor 2a (Mef2a) encodes for a DNA-binding
transcription factor that activates many muscle-speciﬁc, growth
factor-induced and stress-induced genes. Our analysis identiﬁed
three different transcript isoforms in kidney. One isoform con-
tains both exons 7 and 8, and the other two contain either exon 7
or exon 8. All of the three isoforms contain adjacent exons 6 and
9. As expected, we observed lower peaks of RNA-Seq reads
at exons 7 and 8 than their adjacent peaks at exons 6 and 9
(Fig. 6B).

4 DISCUSSION

Compared with the human and mouse genomes, the rat genome
is not as highly annotated. In this study, we improved the

prediction of protein-coding genes after incorporation of
RNA-Seq evidence of transcription from bone marrow, brain
and kidney tissues. Our analysis yielded nearly twice the
number of transcripts in the public rat genome database (rn5)
that currently contains 17938 transcripts that span 16744 loci.
Speciﬁcally, we identiﬁed 32197 transcripts, including 13461
known transcripts, 13 934 novel isoforms and 4802 new genes.
In general, the new analysis predicted longer and more complete
transcripts and discovered more isoforms per gene locus when
compared with the public database.

A large majority of novel genes and isoforms identiﬁed in
our analyses resulted from the use of RNA-Seq data. This was
because the RNA-Seq data contain abundant evidence from
transcribed sequences that may be unavailable in ESTs. In add-
ition, the high depth of sequence coverage of the RNA-Seq
in our experiments allows the detection of extremely low-
expressed transcripts in each rat tissue, which are usually
missed by EST methodology. We used RPKM to measure
mRNA abundance in RNA-Seq experiments, and found that
novel genes tend to have smaller RPKM than known genes

Fig. 5. Venn diagram for novel genes supported by evidence of various
sources. Venn diagram shows the intersection of novel genes supported
by RNAseq (yellow) or EST only (purple), or predicted ab initio from
genomic sequences (blue), or both by RNAseq and EST (orange)

that are present in the public database. In addition to their lower
expression, novel transcript isoforms within known gene loci are
usually expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc manner. Because of these
features, deep RNA sequencing of multiple tissues (and from
different experimental conditions) may be ideal for predict-
ing protein-coding genes in less-well—annotated eukaryotic gen-
omes. This method can provide a more rapid, comprehensive
and cost-effective discovery of novel genes and transcripts com-
pared with ESTs from conventional Sanger sequencing (Roberts
et al. 2011).

We noticed that although the large majority of predicted tran-
scripts are common between RNASeq and EST_RNASeq,
they also had unique sets of transcripts. Integration of different
sets of extrinsic hints may lead to different predicted protein-
coding genes/transcripts. AUGUSTUS is based on a general-
ized hidden Markov model and searches the most likely gene
structure given queried genomic sequences and extrinsic
hints (Stanke et al., 2006a). As a consequence of this, the intro-
duction of hints changes the relative likelihood of the gene
structures. The introduction of hints has two effects on the
prediction of gene structure: the ‘bonus effect’ and ‘malus
effect’. The former increases the likelihood of a particular
gene structure that is compatible with the hint, whereas the lat-
ter decreases that likelihood (Stanke et al., 2006a). Combined
hints from RNA-Seq and EST (i.e. the EST_RNASeq
method) do not necessarily increase the relative likelihood of
a particular gene structure that was initially predicted by the
RNASeq.

Several caveats from our analysis should be acknowledged.
First, the rat shows high genetic similarity to both human and
mouse (Aitman et al., 2008; Atanur et al., 2013; Su et al., 2004).
In our approach, to more accurately identify transcripts and
genes, we ﬁltered results from AUGUSTUS by considering
their phylogenetic conservation across species and homology
with known gene and transcripts. Although such a ﬁltering
strategy is extremely useful to identify a list of transcripts/
genes with high conﬁdence (Supplementary Table S2), it
could potentially overlook a small proportion of species-speciﬁc
genes in the rat genome. It should also be noted that the
number of the identiﬁed transcripts with high conﬁdence is
almost doubled when compared with the current public data-
base. Second, we have demonstrated that many of novel tran-
script isoforms are expressed in a tissue-speciﬁc manner
(Supplementary Fig. S4). In our study, this included only
three tissues, and thus genome annotation could be further im-
proved through analysis of more tissues under additional ex-
perimental conditions. Third, to detect transcripts with low
expression levels, we combined RNA-Seq reads from multiple
libraries of the same tissues from different genetic backgrounds.
This might overlook some strain-speciﬁc transcripts.
Nevertheless, such strain-speciﬁc transcripts account for <1%
of total number of the identiﬁed transcripts (Supplementary
Table S6).

In summary, we have demonstrated that incorporation
of RNA-Seq with EST data into a gene prediction procedure
signiﬁcantly improves annotation of the rat genome. Our study
has identiﬁed 40% more high-conﬁdence novel genes and/or
isoforms in the rat. The large majority of novel genes and iso-
forms are supported by direct evidence from RNA-Seq

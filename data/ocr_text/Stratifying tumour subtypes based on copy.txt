Abstract

Motivation: The role of personalized medicine and target treatment in the clinical management
of cancer patients has become increasingly important in recent years. This has made the task of
precise histological substratification of cancers crucial. Increasingly, genomic data are being
seen as a valuable classifier. Specifically, copy number alteration (CNA) profiles generated by next-
generation sequencing (NGS) can become a determinant for tumours subtyping. The principle pur-
pose of this study is to devise a model with good prediction capability for the tumours histological
subtypes as a function of both the patients covariates and their genome-wide CNA profiles from
NGS data.

Results: We investigate a logistic regression for modelling tumour histological subtypes as a func-
tion of the patients’ covariates and their CNA profiles, in a mixed model framework. The covariates,
such as age and gender, are considered as fixed predictors and the genome-wide CNA profiles are
considered as random predictors. We illustrate the application of this model in lung and oral cancer
datasets, and the results indicate that the tumour histological subtypes can be modelled with a
good fit. Our cross-validation indicates that the logistic regression exhibits the best prediction rela-
tive to other classification methods we considered in this study. The model also exhibits the best
agreement in the prediction between smooth-segmented and circular binary-segmented CNA
profiles.

1 Introduction

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) technology has greatly trans-
formed our way of interrogating genomes and advanced our under-
standing of genomic changes such as copy number alterations
(CNAs). We have previously shown that CNA data can be generated

from routine diagnostic biopsy specimens in a very efficient man-
ner using multiplexed, low-coverage sequencing (Wood et al., 2010)
and developed a robust algorithm to analyse these data in individual
patients (Gusnanto et al., 2012). Our objective in this current study
is to analyse multiple samples from two tumour subtypes

simultaneously and develop informatic techniques to separate them
using their CNA profiles, so that subsequent patients could be better
stratified in a predictive manner.

Currently, methods for studying groups of CNA profiles tend to
focus on looking for similarities in a homogeneous group of samples
(Mermel et al., 2011) or to look for regions of the genome where
two groups of samples are very different (de Ronde et al., 2010). We
are focusing less on the genomic regions involved, and more on the
problem of separating similar groups of samples and predicting to
which group a new sample belongs. More specifically, our focus is
in utilizing the whole (genome-wide) CNA profiles to stratify
tumour subtypes, in addition to other covariates or patients charac-
teristics. This strategy enables us to have a wider picture of the con-
tribution of each genomic region in the stratification, in light of the
contribution of the other regions.

To model the tumour subtypes, we investigate logistic regression
within a random effects model framework, where the contributions
of patients’ clinical characteristics are considered as fixed effects and
those of the CNA profiles are considered as random effects. Because
our interest is in the prediction of tumour subtypes of new samples,
we perform a cross-validation to identify the prediction error of the
model. We compare this prediction error with those from other clas-
sification methods.

As a test dataset, we have analysed a cohort of lung tumours, all
of which are from the two closely related subtypes, squamous cell
carcinoma (SCC) and adenocarcinoma (ADC). Until recently these
have been treated as part of the larger subgroup non-small cell lung
carcinoma (NSCLC), but there is growing evidence that the two
groups should be treated as separate diseases (Gazdar, 2010).

As a validation dataset, we analysed another cohort of two related
tumour subtypes, oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC) and oral ver-
rucous carcinoma (OVC). These subtypes have very different progno-
ses and clinical management, but there can be histological uncertainty
in distinguishing between them (Rekha and Angadi, 2010).

The results of our analysis indicate that the logistic regression en-
ables us to stratify tumour subtypes and investigate genome-wide
contribution of each genomic region to the stratification. The results
also indicate that the logistic regression has good predictive value
for new samples: advantageously, this prediction is achieved regard-
less of the segmentation methods involved in the estimation of
CNA. The latter advantage is important because a number of tools
exist to obtain CNA estimates from NGS data, and they use a var-
iety of pre-processing steps, such as normalization, and a number of
different segmentation methods. Before we discuss those results, we
discuss first the logistic regression in the next section.

2 Methods

2.1 Patients, sequence data and alignments

Seventy-six lung cancer patients were included in this study from
Leeds Teaching Hospital (UK), comprising of two groups: squamous
carcinoma (38 patients) and ADC (38 patients). We recorded the pa-
tients’ clinical characteristics, but in this study we only consider age
and gender as covariates. For a validation of our methods, samples
from 102 oral cancer patients were collected from Leeds Teaching
Hospitals (UK), Queen Victoria Hospital (Sussex, UK), University of
Torino (Italy) and the National Guard Hospital (Saudi Arabia),
comprising of 45 OSCC samples and 57 OVC samples.
Unfortunately, for this cohort of patients, we could not obtain the
patients’ clinical characteristics, and only work with their CNA pro-
files. The main body of this manuscript will deal largely with the

lung cancer dataset. The experimental validation using the oral can-
cer dataset will mainly be presented in the Supplementary Material.
Details on sample preparation, DNA extraction and library
preparation are described by Wood et al. (2010). Sequences were
aligned using the bwa suite version 0.5 .9-r16 (Li and Durbin, 2009)
against assembly hg19 of the human genome. Only sequences that
could be uniquely aligned and with mapping quality 237 were used.

2.2 Normalization and CNA estimate

The CNA profile from each lung tumour is calculated by ‘depth of
coverage’ from their sequences. For this purpose, the optimal win-
dow size for this group of samples is estimated using N GSoptwin
package to be 150 kb (Gusnanto et al., 2014). The sequence data
from 76 cancer patients are not directly comparable because inevit-
ably the tumour samples are contaminated with normal cells by dif-
ferent degrees. To deal with this problem, we performed a
normalization using the CNAnorm package Gusnanto et al. (2012)
to obtain the CNA estimates. An example of CNA estimates is pre-
sented in Figure 1 for patient LS67, which can be in two forms de-
pending on the segmentation method used:

1. Smooth estimate, where CNA is estimated as smooth segmented
lines (Huang et al., 2007). The main characteristic of the esti-
mate is that the segmented line is smooth and follows the sudden
‘jumps’ and ‘drops’ in the CNA proﬁle. This is illustrated in the
top row of Figure 1.

2. DNACopy estimate, where CNA is estimated as circular binary seg-
mented lines (Olshen et al., 2004). The main characteristic of the es-
timate is that the segmented line tends to form relatively long
constant segments. This is illustrated in the bottom row of Figure 1.

With 150 kb window size, we approximately have slightly more
than 20 000 windows to cover the whole genome. In this study, we
exclude the CNA estimates from the sex chromosomes and the
centromere regions, where some missing values can be problematic
in the analysis. After we remove them, we have CNA estimates from
17 571 genomic windows in two different forms as described earlier.
For each form of CNA estimate, the CNA profiles from the patients
are summarized in a matrix of size 76 by 17 5 71.

2.3 Logistic regression
At this stage, our data consist of three components: (i) the binary tu-
mour histological subtype (squamous carcinoma 2 1, ADC = 0),

(ii) age and gender as covariates and (iii) the CNA estimates across
17 571 genomic windows. To model the binary histological subtype,
logistic regression is a natural choice because we can extend the
standard model to deal with the second type of predictors namely
CNA profiles. One of the immediate challenges dealing with this
type of data is the dimension of the CNA profiles. We have a data
matrix of size n X q where 76 = 11 < q = 17 5 71. A standard logistic
regression will fail in the computation because the number of vari-
ables far exceeds the number of observations. To proceed, we extend
the standard model by assuming that the parameters of CNA to fol-
low a Normal distribution.

Specifically, in vector notation, consider y as a vector of binary
tumour histology with 31,-: 1 if the tumour is squamous carcinoma
and 3),: 0 if the tumour is ADC, for i = 1, 2, ... ,n. We assume that
)1 follow a Binomial(1,u) distribution with u is the probability of the
tumour being squamous carcinoma. In logistic regression, we model

[7(a) =Xﬁ+Zy (1)
where  is a logit link function that applies elementwise, X is a
matrix of fixed covariates of size n X p, [f is a P-vector of fixed
effects for matrix X, Z is matrix of CNA estimates of size n X q, and
32 is a q-vector of random effects for matrix Z. We assume that 32,-,
j = 1, . . . ,q would follow a Normal(0,rz) distribution.
The joint log likelihood of the parameters is given by

108 L03, v, r2) = log Poly) +10g P0) (2)

where p(y|32) is the likelihood based on conditional distribution of y
given 32, and p(32) is the likelihood based on the Normal distribution
of random effects 32. Given the data y1,y2, . . . ,3)”, the log likelihood
is given by

1
logL(/3, v, r2) = Zmlog 112+ (1 — yiﬂog (1 — #2)} — Ell: v} (3)

where u,- is a logistic function of [f and 32, and 2 = 

2.3.1 Estimation of [i and 3! at fixed 2

The estimation of [f and 32 in (3) can be performed using iterative
weighted least squares (IWLSs) at a fixed value of 2. At a fixed value
of 2 and starting values of Bo and 320, IWLS is performed to find the
solution of mixed model equation

X'z—lx X'z—lz [i X'z—l Y (4)
z'z—lx z'z—lz + D-1 32 2'?1 Y

tity matrix of size q.

2. calculate 320”) = (Z’E‘1Z + D‘1)_1Z’2_1Y
3. calculate BO") 2 (X’ET1X)_1X’2_1Y

where in steps (2) and (3) we use the current values of 2 and Y. We
iterate the above steps until convergence and, at convergence,

we obtain the estimates [3 and 37. The dimension of matrix
(z'z—lz + D-l) is in the order of 17571 x 17 571 so that its inver-
sion is a computational bottle neck in the iteration. To overcome
this problem, we use a computational modification that are dis-
cussed further in Section 2.4.

The approximate standard errors for [3 and 37 are given by the
square root of the diagonal of

(X’s—1X)‘1 <5)
and
(z'z—lz + D—1)—1, (6)

respectively, where S = 2 + IZZZ’.

2.3.2 Estimation of 1'2 given [3 and 3!

We estimate [1 and 32 above at a given value of 12, and 12 can be esti-
mated as the one that minimizes Akaike’s Information Criterion
(AIC) or through cross-validation. The calculation of AIC in prac-
tice is described further in Section 2.4.

2.4 Computational consideration

The size of the matrix (Z’E‘1Z + D‘l) involved in the above com-
putation is in the order of 17 5 71 X 17 5 71. To reduce the computa-
tional burden, we consider a modification of the computation to
find the solution of the above estimation problem. We can overcome
this problem by representing the matrix Z (of size n x q) as a multi-
plication of special matrices in singular value decomposition (SVD)
(Eilers et al., 2001). Let us define

z = UQV’

where U and Q are of size n X n, and V is of size q x n, such that U’
U = In, V’V = 1,, (but VVI 75 lg), and Q is a diagonal matrix of sin-
gular values of Z.

Using this decomposition, the relevant part in 4 can be rewritten as

((UQ)’E‘1(UQ)+ 21..)r‘ = (UQYE‘lY <7)

where 32 2 V3*. Based on this representation, the updating equation
in step (2) in the above iteration gives an update for 3* (hence
also 32), and at convergence we obtain the estimates [3 and 32 (via 32*).
The SVD is only done once before IWLS, as the quantities that are
updated in the above iteration are only Y(m), SW), Bo") and 320”) (via
32*(m)). With this representation, the dimension of the matrix inver-
sion reduces dramatically from q x q to a manageable n X n.
In the estimation of 12 (Section 2.3.2), we minimize the AIC

AIC = —210g L02) + 2df

where

L0) = Zmlog 112+ (1 — 30108 (1 — #2)}

and fl is calculated in a logistic function using [3 and 37 (via 37*). The
degrees of freedom is computed as

df = trace{ ((UQ)'2-1(UQ) + 11)‘1((UQ)'2-1(UQ) + 11)}
(Pawitan, 2001).
2.5 Cross-validation

In building a logistic regression to model tumour histology, we
wanted to consider how well the model can be employed to make

prediction of new observations. To obtain the prediction of the hist-
ology based on the CNA profiles, we performed a cross-validation.
We randomly split 11 observations into training set of size 11, and val-
idation set of size 11,, (11,; + 11,, = n) such that

W X1) 21/

The training set serves as the set by which we estimate the model
parameters [3, and 37,. The estimates are then used in the validation
set to obtain model prediction

3,, = 1(b—1{X,,Z$, + 2,3,}205), (8)

where I equals one (squamous group) if the expression inside the
brackets is true, and zero (ADC group) otherwise.

From this prediction, we obtain how many tumour histologies in
the validation set are misclassified (classification error). Denoting yl,
— ' d f 8 A — A A A ' d f'

— (m m  m.) an , mm W — (m m  yam) , we 6 me
the classification error as

"1;
CE = Eloy). 7e 9.).)- (9)
[2:1

We also calculate this error as percentages out of nu, which are pre-
sented in the Supplementary Material.

In our application, we perform the cross-validation 100 times
where, out of 76 observations, 38 observations are randomly se-
lected to be in the training set and the remaining 38 observations are
in the validation set. To see whether the classification error obtained
by logistic regression is within a reasonable range, we need to
consider other classification methods in the cross-validation.
This enables us to get a better view of the performance of the logistic
regression model (Section 2.3) in the prediction of tumour histology.

Some classification models that we consider in the cross-
validation are: (i) k-nearest neighbour (KNN) with k = 1, . . . ,7, (ii)
diagonal-quadratic and diagonal-linear discriminant-analysis (DA),
(iii) partial least squares (PLSs), (iv) elastic net, (v) lasso, (vi)
neural network, (vii) support vector machines and (viii) smoothed
logistic regression [SLR, Huang et al. (2009)]. For this purpose, we
only use the CNA profiles based on the smooth and circular binary
segmentation (CBS), i.e. X, and X, are just vector of ones, and [it is
just an estimate of fixed intercept (from the training set). Note that
the elastic-net and lasso models are essentially logistic regression
with different penalties to the likelihood that that we describe in
Section 2.3. To avoid confusion, we reserve the term ‘logistic regres-
sion’ for the one we describe in Section 2.3. We use the terms ‘elas-
tic-net’ and ‘lasso’ to refer to the logistic regression with elastic net
and lasso penalties, and use the acronym ‘SLR’ to refer to the SLR.

2.6 Agreement in prediction between segmentation
methods
A concern that we have in the analysis is whether the choice of seg-
mentation method that we use to estimate CNA really does deter-
mine whether a patient’s tumour histology is misclassified or not,
given a classification model. In other words, if a patient’s tumour is
predicted as ADC based on smooth-segmented CNA, is it also pre-
dicted as ADC based on CBS-segmented CNA? To answer this ques-
tion, we also estimate the agreement in prediction between these
two very different segmentation methods.

Let us denote ZS and Z" as CNA profiles based on the smooth
and CBS segmentation, respectively. Let us also denote  and 3A): to

be the fixed and random parameter estimates from the training set
using CNA profiles based on smooth segmentation. Similarly, we
denote [it and 3A2;ll as the estimates in the training set using CNA pro-
files based on CBS (DNACopy) segmentation. We distinguish the
predicted tumour histology in the validation set using CNA profiles
based on the smooth and CBS segmentation as

5,; = 1(h—1{Xyﬁ: + Z;3;§}20.5) and (10)

.521(2—1{x.zs:+zz):}zo.s), an

respectively.

Denoting )Alf,=()7f,1)7f,2  ﬁn”), and )7: = (951952  23%)],

we measure the agreement in prediction between the two segmenta-
tion methods as

1 "I;
Kzn_yZI(yvj:yZ/')' (12)

i=1

A high value of K indicates that, given a classification model, the pre-
diction in the validation using CNA profiles based on smooth seg-
mentation is in agreement with those based on the CBS
segmentation.

2.7 Software

An R package called CNALR is available from the corresponding
author’s webpage (‘Availability’ in the abstract section), including
some tools to combine the results of normalization from CNAnorm
package (Gusnanto et al., 2012). The CNAnorm package normal-
izes each sequence individually, and the CNALR package will select
relevant quantities from the CNAnorm output. The CNALR pack-
age contains functions to handle the CNA profiles across patients
and fit a logistic regression.

3 Results

In this section, we mainly present the results for the lung cancer
dataset. For the oral cancer dataset, we present its results mainly in
the Supplementary Material.

3.1 CNA profiles

In this section, we briefly describe the summary of the profiles
within each histology. Figure 2 shows (point-wise) means of the
CNA profiles across the patients within each of the squamous and
ADC groups. One point in Figure 2 corresponds to a genomic win-
dow, and is the mean of CNA at the same genomic window (as illus-
trated in Fig. 1) across different patients in each histology group.
The figure indicates that the means of CNA profiles between the
two groups share many similarities, although some differences can
be observed. For example, we observe that the overall gains in 3g
and 2p regions are higher in the squamous group than those in the
ADC group.

Although the pattern in, e.g. 3q region indicates a separation be-
tween the squamous and ADC groups, this does not mean that a
modelling is not needed. Gains in 2p and 3c] are not exclusive to the
squamous group, just more common. If we rely the classification of
tumour histology only on the pattern that we observe in the 3g re-
gion, then effectively we ignore the contribution of other genomic
regions in the genome, as well as risk mis-classifying any sample
which happens by chance to have a small number of CNAs in the
‘wrong’ places. Our results below suggest that the histology

prediction of new samples does not necessarily improve if the predic-
tion relies only on CNA profiles from some genomic windows.

3.2 Model fit

We fit the logistic regression on the covariates and CNA profiles of
the patients. An important parameter to be estimated from the
model is 2, and this is described in Figure 3. The figure indicates that
the optimal 2 in the model is estimated as exp(6) and exp(6.5) for
CNA profiles using smooth segmentation and CBS segmentation,
respectively.

Using the optimal 2, the results of estimation in the (fixed) cova-
riates are presented in Table 1. The table indicates that none of the
(fixed) covariates is statistically significant (i.e. P-value > 0.05).
These results suggest that there is no significance difference in pa-
tients’ age and gender distribution between the squamous and ADC
groups.

The random effects estimates of the logistic regression are pre-
sented in Figure 4. An immediate pattern that we could see is the
magnitude of the estimates for the genomic windows in the 3g re-
gion. This pattern suggests that CNA gains in the region contribute
to increase the probability of the tumour to be classified into the
squamous group, and CNA losses to the ADC group. On the other
hand, negative estimates as we see in most of chromosome four indi-
cate that CNA gains in the region contribute to increase the prob-
ability of the tumour being classified as ADC group and CNA losses
to the squamous group.

The model fit for our analysis is presented in Figure 5. The figure
indicates that the logistic regression can fit the data very well, where
the tumour histology is correctly classified.

In Figure 4, we need to be careful in interpreting the pattern of
the random effects estimates. None of the individual random effects
estimates is statistically significant, in the sense that all of the 95%
individual confidence interval for the random effects include zero.
This does not mean that there is no information contained in the
data. This is just a result of the estimation of more than 17 000 par-
ameters from just 76 observations. This is also not a contradiction
when we consider that the model has a good fit as shown in
Figure 5. From the construction of the model, although the

individual random effects estimates are not significant, there is a lin-
ear combination of window-wise CNA profiles that jointly classify
the tumour histology.

3.3 Cross-validation

The results of cross-validation for the lung cancer dataset are pre-
sented in Figure 6. The figure indicates that the logistic regression
has the lowest median classification error in comparison to the other
classification models that we consider in our study. The use of KNN
and discriminant analysis give a relatively high classification error.
This high error is consistent regardless of the number of neighbour
in KNN or the type of discriminant analysis.

The PLSs gives relatively low median of classification error,
which are comparable to that of the logistic regression. In building
the classification rule, PLS expands the space on the CNA mean dif-
ferences [see for example Barker and Rayens (2003)], without being
weighted by the between-class covariance matrix. Given that CNA
profiles can exhibit dramatic changes of copy number, PLS ignores
the between-class covariance-matrix (i.e. focus on the differences on
copy number) to give a good prediction.

The elastic-net and lasso models give a slightly higher median
classification error than that of the logistic regression when we use
smooth-segmented CNA profiles, but not when we use CBS-seg-
mented CNA profiles. This is an interesting result because the elas-
tic-net and lasso models produce sparse solution on the parameters
where some of the estimates are zero estimated. Effectively, a vari-
able selection is embedded inside the classification models. Our re-
sults indicate that when we use smooth-segmented CNA profiles as
predictors, the variable selection does not necessarily produces
higher prediction (or lower error). On the CBS-segmented CNA

Genomic windows with missing values (such as in the centromere regions)
are removed from the figure. We currently do not include sex and mitochon-
drial chromosomes in the analysis. The points on the horizontal axis indicate
4549 (smooth) and 3633 (DNACopy) genomic windows (25.9 and 19.8%) that
have significant differences of CNA profiles between the squamous and ADC
groups, using a permutation method. A more detailed view of the random ef-

profiles, the variable selection still gives the same low median of
classification error as that of logistic regression (Section 2.3).

For the oral cancer data, we have a more challenging situation
where it is sometimes more difficult to distinguish oral squamous
cell carcinoma (OSCC) from OVC histologically. Figure 7 describes
the prediction error in the oral cancer data. The figure indicates that
the logistic regression and SLR have the lowest prediction error in
both smooth and CBS (DNAcopy) segmented CNA profiles.
Support vector machines with nu-classification has a low prediction
error comparable to the logistic regression, only when using the
smooth-segmented CNA profiles.

Still within the cross-validation, Figure 8 presents how the two
segmentation methods (smooth and CBS segmentation) agree in pre-
diction within the validation set. If the agreement is low, then the
choice of segmentation method does matter—in terms of

each of the training set and validation set) using only the smooth- and CBS-
segmented CNA profiles in the lung cancer dataset across different classifi-
cation models: Iogistic regression ('Log’), KNN with k = 1,2 ('K1’-’K2’), diag-
onal quadratic (’DA1’) and linear (’DA2’) discriminant analysis, 'PLSs’, elastic
net ('Net’), lasso ('Las’), neural network (’NN’), support vector machines with
C-classification ('SV1’), nu classification ('SV2’), and bound-constraint classifi-
cation (‘SV3’) and ’SLR’. The horizontal dotted line is the median of classifica-
tion error of the logistic regression. Figures with ’K3’-'K7’ are presented in the

classification error—when we use a particular classification method.
The contrary can be said if the agreement is high. Figure 8 indicates
that we have a high agreement when we use logistic regression and
support vector machines. PLS, elastic net and lasso models have
lower agreement in the lung cancer data compared with the logistic
regression, and this agreement increases in the oral cancer data to be
comparable to the logistic regression.

The overall results of our cross-validation suggest that the logis-
tic regression is able to achieve a low classification error while main-
taining high agreement in prediction between the smooth- and CBS-
segmented CNA profiles.

4 Discussion

In predicting tumour histology, the main challenge is to consider a
model with low classification error. Further than that, we are also
interested in the agreement between smooth- and CBS-segmented
CNA profiles in the prediction of new tumour sample. This is crit-
ical when we consider that the CNA profiles are derived from low-
coverage NGS data that have undergone several preparation steps.
This includes, but is not limited to, mapping to the reference gen-
ome, filtering, optimal window estimation, normalization (including
normalization due to contamination) and segmentation. To have a
classification method with a good prediction while having a min-
imum dependency on a previous pre-processing step is a great
advantage.

The logistic regression described in Section 2.3 (also known as
Tikhonov regularization) is well-known to tend to group variables
(genomic window) together (Zou and Hastie, 2005). This property of

Classification methods

Fig. 7. Classification error from 100 cross-validations (52 and 50 observa-
tions in the training set and validation set, respectively) in the oral cancer
dataset using only the smooth- and CBS-segmented CNA profiles across dif-
ferent classification models: logistic regression ('Log’), KNN with k=1,2
(’K1’-'K2’), diagonal quadratic (’DA1’) and linear (’DA2’) discriminant analysis,
'PLSs’, elastic net ('Net’), lasso ('Las’), neural network ('NN’), support vector
machines with C-classification ('SV1’), nu classification ('SV2’), and bound-
constraint classification ('SV3’) and 'SLR’. The horizontal dotted line is the
median of classification error of the logistic regression. Figures with ’K3’-'K7’
are presented in the Supplementary Material. The significance of the classifi-
cation error between pair of methods are also presented in the

the logistic regression is likely to predominate in prediction, in terms
of classification error and agreement between the segmentation meth-
ods, because there are some dependencies of CNA between neigh-
bouring genomic windows. The lasso and elastic net models achieve
comparable classification error as the logistic regression only when
the CNA profiles are CBS-segmented. The CBS (DNACopy) segmen-
tation generally outputs long segments, and the variable selection ef-
fect that the two methods produce does not impair the prediction
because the genomic regions that survive the penalization are able to
represent the information of the whole segment.

We have demonstrated the ability of the proposed method to dis-
tinguish between two subtypes of lung cancer. We then validated
this method in a separate cohort of oral cancer patients, whose diag-
nosis is not always straightforward, but whose prognosis is very dif-
ferent. However, in theory, it could be used to distinguish between
any subtypes of tumour, or to make predictions about disease pro-
gression, drug resistance or outcome.

Currently, several molecular classifiers are used to distinguish
cancer subtypes, among them mRNA or protein expression. These
are both selective methods. The study of mRNA usually involved
the removal of non-coding RNA and micro RNA, the roles of which
are increasingly becoming apparent. The study of protein expression
usually involves only a few known proteins. Both of these methods
will also involve further depletion of valuable sample material.
Where there is no known mRNA or protein signature, our method
may prove useful in finding previously unsuspected differences in
the genomes of two sample groups. Low coverage sequencing is also
possible with extremely low quantities of badly degraded DNA

prediction from 100 cross-validations in the lung cancer dataset (top panel)
and oral cancer dataset (bottom panel) across different classification mod-
els: logistic regression (’Log’), KNN with k=1,2 (’K1’-’K2’), diagonal quad-
ratic (’DA1’) and linear ('DA2’) discriminant analysis, 'PLSs’, elastic net ('Net’),
lasso ('Las’), neural network (’NN’), support vector machines with C-classifi-
cation ('SV1’), nu classification ('SV2’), and bound-constraint classification
('SV3’) and 'SLR’. For the oral cancer dataset (bottom panel) the agreement
for DA1 and DA2 are below 0.6. The horizontal dotted line is the median of
agreement in the logistic regression. Figures with ’K3’-'K7’ are presented in
the Supplementary Material

(Wood et al., 2010). If mRNA or protein tests are available, then
their results can be easily added to the logistic regression method as
additional predictors and will further improve performance.

5 Conclusion

We have investigated that the use of logistic regression to model
tumour histology and include the genome-wide CNA profiles as
predictors. The model enables us to include clinical characteristics
as fixed covariates and CNA profiles as random predictors in a
single modelling framework. The model exhibits a good fit and, in a
cross-validation, shows minimal classification error. The model also
demonstrates the best agreement in prediction between CNA pro-
files produced by two very different segmentation methods.

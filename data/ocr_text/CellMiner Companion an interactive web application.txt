Abstract

Summary: The NCl—60 human tumor cell line panel is an invaluable resource for cancer re—
searchers, providing drug sensitivity, molecular and phenotypic data for a range of cancer types.
CellMiner is a web resource that provides tools for the acquisition and analysis of quality—controlled
NCl—60 data. CellMiner supports queries of up to 150 drugs or genes, but the output is an Excel file
for each drug or gene. This output format makes it difficult for researchers to explore the data from
large queries. CellMiner Companion is a web application that facilitates the exploration and visual—
ization of output from CellMiner, further increasing the accessibility of NCl—60 data.

Availability and Implementation: The web application is freely accessible at https://pul—bioinfor
matics.shinyapps.io/CellMinerCompanion. The R source code can be downloaded at https://github.

1 Introduction

The National Cancer Institute Developmental Therapeutics Program
initiated a 60 human tumor cell line (NCI—60) anticancer drug screen
over two decades ago (Shoemaker, 2006). The NCI—60 database in—
cludes drug sensitivity data from more than 50 000 compounds and
molecular data such as gene expression, miRNA expression, protein
expression, genetic variation and DNA copy number. The NCI—60
data have been used to determine drug mode of action and potential
molecular targets (Shoemaker, 2006). The NCI—60 data have also
been used to develop predictive models for drug sensitivity (Abaan
et al., 2013).

The CellMiner database (http://disc0ver.nci.nih.gov/cellminer/)
provides access to quality—controlled NCI—60 pharmacological and
molecular data (Reinhold et 61]., 2012). CellMiner also provides ana—
lysis tools to explore the NCI—60 data. The Pattern Comparison
Tool enables the discovery of drugs or genes with similar patterns of
sensitivity or expression across the NCI—60 panel. The query output

is a spreadsheet that includes a Pearson correlation coefficient be—
tween the query drug(s) or gene(s) and every other drug and gene in
the database. Researchers can then submit up to 150 of these identi—
fiers to CellMiner to obtain additional data in a single query. The re—
sult is multiple spreadsheets making integrative analysis of the
results difficult for researchers that lack computer programming
skills.

The recent R package, rcellminer (Luna et al. 2015; Reinhold
et 61]., 2012), provides a powerful programmatic interface to the
NCI—60 data, duplicating and enhancing the tools on the CellMiner
website. However, rcellminer is designed for experienced R users.

Here, we present CellMiner Companion, a web application that
enables researchers to explore the output of CellMiner queries. The
data from multiple files is summarized, assembled into a single data
matrix, z—score normalized, clustered and visualized both as a heat—
map and dendrogram. Users can interactively change many param-
eters to explore the relationship among drugs or genes across the

NCI—60 cell lines. Importantly, this tool increases the accessibility of
the NCI—60 data to those lacking programming skills. Further,
CellMiner Companion could be incorporated easily into workﬂows
that use rcellminer.

2 Implementation

CellMiner Companion is implemented in R as a Shiny application
(Chang et al., 2016; R Core Team, 2015). Data can be uploaded as
multiple Excel files returned by CellMiner or as a single Excel file
generated from a template. The data is parsed from the files and
reformatted as a single data matrix. A data summary is produced
that includes the number of replicate experiments that underlie the
dataset, the range of values, and both the number of repeated values
and missing values in each dataset. This report serves as a useful
quality check of the individual datasets.

To aid comparisons between drugs or genes, the data is z-score
normalized. Z—scores can be calculated by drug or gene or across the
entire dataset. The latter method can aid the absolute comparison of
drugs or genes, but this method must be used cautiously because
concentration units can differ between drugs. Specific cell lines can
be excluded from the analysis.

Hierarchical clustering is performed on the z—scores columnwise,
i.e. to cluster gene or drug patterns across the cell lines. The cell lines
are grouped by tissue of origin, and the order of cell lines is fixed ac-
cording to the CellMiner standard (Supplementary Table S1). Three
distance choices are implemented: Euclidean, Manhattan and the
Pearson correlation distance. The Pearson correlation distance is a
good metric to explore trends in drug activity or gene expression
across the NCI—60 panel. Euclidean and Manhattan distances can re—
veal quantitative differences.

The columns of the z—score matrix can be reordered based on the
hierarchical clustering, and a heatmap is generated with breakpoints
determined by the deciles of the z—score matrix, or set z—scores of 0,
:1.65, :1.96, :2.57, :3.30, i5, grouping data into bins with
P-values 0f> 0.1, £0.05, £0.01 and 30.001 (P—values are not ad—
justed for multiple comparisons). The upper and lower breakpoints
are extended to cover the range of the dataset.

To help researchers assess the hiearchical clustering, a silhouette
analysis is performed (Rousseeuw, 1987). Silhouette values can
range from —1 to 1. A value of 1 indicates that a sample is perfectly
placed in a cluster, a value of 0 indicates that a sample falls between
two clusters and negative values suggest that a sample is placed in
the wrong cluster. The average silhouette value for a cluster indi—
cates how tight samples group within that cluster. Similarly, the
mean silhouette for a group of clusters can be used to assess the
overall quality of a clustering analysis. CellMiner Companion pro-
duces a plot that shows the mean silhouette values from [3:2 to
k = 11 clusters, where n is the number of input files. Researchers are
encouraged to choose [a so that the mean silhouette value is maxi—
mized. When researchers choose a specific value for k, a table of
silhouette values for each sample and each cluster is produced.
This helps researchers identify tight clusters as well as possible out—
liers in their data.

3 Example

Cancer patients can exhibit multidrug resistance (MDR) due to the
overexpression of genes encoding transporters that can pump drugs
out of cells, e.g. the resistance of cells to Doxorubicin by the overex—
pression of ABCB1 (Reinhold et al., 2012; Szakacs et al., 2006).

CellMiner and CellMiner Companion were used to find other pos—
sible instances of MDR in the NCI—60 data.

The gene expression pattern for 21 transporter genes was retrieved
from CellMiner and visualized with CellMiner Companion
(Supplementary Fig. Sl and Supplementary Table S2). Five genes with
distinct patterns of overexpression across the NCI—60 cell lines were
selected for further analysis (Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S3).
For each of these genes, there were one or two cell lines that showed
strong evidence of overexpression, with z—scores Z 3.30. These seven
cell line—gene combinations are highlighted in Figure 1A. The five
genes were submitted to CellMiner for Pattern Comparisons.

For Pattern Comparisons between gene expression and drug sen—
sitivity, a significant negative Pearson correlation suggests that, in
the simplest model, a cell line has become resistant to the drug due
to overexpression of a gene. Conversely, a significant positive
Pearson correlation suggests that a cell line has become sensitive to
the drug. To find putative instances of MDR, drugs were selected
from the Pattern Comparison data based on the following criteria:
(i) all FDA-approved drugs with a Pearson correlation £—0.334,
(ii) the twenty drugs with the most negative Pearson correlation
g—O.334 and (iii) for drugs with multiple National Service Center
(NSC) numbers and similar Pearson corrleations, all NSC numbers
were included for evaluation with CellMiner Companion.
Collectively, 140 drugs met these criteria (Supplementary Table S4).

The drug sensitivity data was retrieved from CellMiner and
visualized with CellMiner Companion (Supplementary Figs 82—86).
For each gene, three representative drugs were chosen using the data
summary produced by CellMiner Companion for quality control.
The pattern of activity for the resulting fifteen drugs was then ana—
lyzed with CellMiner Companion (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig.
S7). Not surprisingly, the maximum silhouette value of 0.32
occurred with five clusters, and the mean silhouette values for the in—
dividual clusters ranged from 0.19 to 0.57 (Supplementary Table
S5). With the exception of drug 690 757, the drug sensitivity pat—
terns clustered according to the expression patterns of the five
underlying query genes.

Importantly, the seven cell line—gene combinations highlighted
in Figure 1A now reveal 21 cell line—drug sensitivities (Fig. 1B).
In nineteen instances, z s —1.65 corresponding to an unadjusted
p—value g 0.05 (Supplementary Table S6). In fourteen instances,
z 3 —3.39 corresponding to an unadjusted P g 0.001. This is strong
evidence to support that overexpression of these transporter genes
can lead to MDR. However, MDR is a complicated process
(Szakacs, 2006), so it is not surprising that there is not a perfect cor—
relation between gene expression and drug sensitivity. Furthermore,
careful experimental validation would be required to confirm that
the observed MDR is caused by the overexpression of these specific
genes.

This example illustrates how researchers can use CellMiner and
CellMiner Companion to explore NCI—60 data. In the example, 141
datasets, 21 genes and 120 drugs, were visualized at various steps to
arrive at Figure 1A and B. Integrating these datasets from the ori—
ginal 141 CellMiner Excel files is beyond the capability of many re—
searchers, but quite painless with CellMiner Companion, making it
a useful tool for researchers to confirm, or generate, hypotheses
related to gene expression and drug sensitivity. The tool also has the
capacity to visualize microRNA expression data (Supplemental
Fig. 58). In the future, we intend to develop methods to enable users
to visualize the genetic variation and DNA copy number data for
the NCI—60 cell lines. For those with programming experience, the
underlying code is easily adaptable to other similar datasets, e.g. the
Broad—Novartis Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia.

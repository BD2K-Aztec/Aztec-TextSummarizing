Abstract

Summary: The composition of immune-cell subsets is key to the understanding of major diseases
and pathologies. Computational deconvolution methods enable researchers to investigate immune
cell quantities in complex tissues based on transcriptome data. Here we present Imeuant, a soft-
ware tool allowing immunologists to upload transcription profiles of multiple tissue samples, apply
deconvolution methodology to predict differences in cell type quantities between the samples, and
then inspect the inferred cell type alterations using convenient visualization tools. Imeuant builds
on the DCQ deconvolution algorithm and allows a user-friendly utilization of this method by non-
bioinformatician researchers. Specifically, it enables investigation of hundreds of immune cell subsets
in mouse tissues, as well as a few dozen cell types in human samples.

1 Introduction

The repertoire of changes in immune-cell types between different physi-
ological states and the accurate determination of these changes can facili-
tate biomedical research, diagnosis and treatment. Despite this important
attribute, experimental quantiﬁcation of cell types has remained relative-
ly low throughput. One attractive approach is to apply deconvolution
techniques to infer the composition of cell types based on gene-
expression data, thus avoiding the need for experimental cell sorting
(Shen-Orr and Gaujoux, 2013).

Using immune deconvolution methods, the quantities of cell subsets
within a given heterogeneous tissue can be inferred based on (i) tran-
scription proﬁling of a tissue sample, (ii) prior knowledge about the
signatures of immune-cell subsets (referred to as 'reference data'), and
(iii) a group of effective gene markers for each of the cell subsets in the
reference data. Most deconvolution methods were proven useful in hu-
man applications, where the reference datasets are of intermediate sizes
(22 and 38 cell types in the IRIS and DMAP reference datasets, respec-
tively (Abbas, et al., 2005; Novershtem, et al., 2011)). However, these

methods are typically not scalable to the substantially larger number of
reference signatures that are available in mouse (207 cell types in the
ImmGen dataset (Heng and Painter, 2008)).

To address this, we recently introduced the DCQ deconvolution algo-
rithm, which can robustly infer differences between murine samples at a
scale of a few hundreds of cell types (Altboum, et al., 2014). DCQ is
focused on fold changes in cell type quantities between samples while
assuming sparse changes in cell-type composition (that is, assuming that
only a subset of the cell types differs between the compared samples).
Using this assumption, DCQ can be effectively applied on mouse tissues
utilizing the cell types contained in the ImmGen dataset. Indeed, the
accuracy of DCQ on mouse samples was validated using several simula-
tions and experimental approaches (e. g., Frishberg, et al., 2015;
Tisoncik-Go, et al., 2016).

Since DCQ was so far applied only on mouse data, we decided to test
the performance of DCQ in the case of human data as well. To facilitate
the use of DCQ by immunologists, we developed Imeuant, a freely
available multiplatform software (running on both Windows and Mac)
that enables users to apply DCQ on transcription proﬁling in heterogene-

ous samples, both human and mouse, and observe the inferred alterations
in composition of immune-cell populations using convenient visualiza-
tions. Our simulations show that Imeuant can withstand the large
number of predicted cell subsets in mouse data while maintaining a good
accuracy in human data. We show that DCQ can be usefully applied, for
example, to examine immune cell type alterations in murine lung infec-
tion and in human SjOgren's syndrome pathogenesis.

2 Methods

The DCQ algorithm. Imeuant performs deconvolution using the
DCQ algorithm (Altboum, et al., 2014). DCQ takes as input (1) a relative
expression proﬁle, calculated as the transcription fold-change between
two heterogeneous samples; (2) a reference dataset, consisting of tran-
scriptional signatures of immune-cell subsets; and (3) a list of informa-
tive marker genes. Using this input, DCQ decomposes the relative ex-
pression proﬁle into cell type differences between the two samples (see
Supplementary Methods for full details).

Reference data and marker genes. Imeuant beneﬁts from two
reference datasets in human. First, the IRIS dataset (Abbas, et al., 2005),
which consists of 22 transcription proﬁles of immune-cell types isolated
from normal human blood. Secondly, the DMAP dataset movershtem, et
al., 2011) that carries 38 different cell types, including 21 intermediate
maturation states isolated from umbilical cord blood and 17 terminally
differentiated cell types isolated from peripheral blood. In mouse,
Imeuant utilizes the 207 cell types in ImmGen (Heng and Painter,
2008), consisting of cell types isolated ﬁom 22 different tissues. Cell
types were proﬁled either in the basal state or following a variety of
extracellular stimuli. For each reference data, marker genes were
collected as previouser reported (see Supplementary Methods).

3 Results

We ﬁrst evaluated the quality of DCQ using synthetic data, focusing
on assessment of performance using the low and high number of cell
types in the human and mouse reference collections, respectively. Our
analysis showed that DCQ accurately predicts relative cell type quanti-
ties across a range of numbers of cell types. In comparison with existing
methods, DCQ achieves the best performance when using mouse data
and is the second best for human data. A detailed description of data
generation and performance evaluation is provided in Supplementary
Methods, Supplementary Information 1 and Supplementary Table 1.

We next aimed to provide a software tool to enable non-
bioinformatician users to apply DCQ on their own datasets. Imeuant
implements the entire analysis pipeline: ﬁrst, import of the transcription-
proﬁling data; next, selection of reference data and marker genes; and
ﬁnally, visualization of the resulting cell-type quantities (Figure 1 and
Supplementary Figure 1). Reference data and marker genes can either
be selected ﬁom a collection of pre-compiled options (two reference
datasets in human and one dataset in mouse), or alternatively, be upload-
ed by the user. The ability to add user-defmed reference datasets opens
the way to future deconvolution analyses of newly identiﬁed cell types.
Finally, Imeuant allows two types of fold-change calculations: relative
to the average of all samples and relative to a selected subset of control
samples. We note that Imeuant does not support data pre-processing,
and the input gene-expression is assumed to be normalized beforehand
(Supplementary Methods). Deconvolution takes several minutes for a
dataset of 100 samples (see Supplementary Table 1).

Imeuant provides several options for visualization of the inferred
cell-type quantities, including a matrix viewer, a comparative viewer,

and projection of the cell-type quantities on top of the haematopoietic-
lineage tree (Supplementary Figure lc-e). The predicted quantities and
various visualizations can be easily exported for further analysis. A
detailed description of the Imeuant pipeline is provided in Supple-
mentary Methods. Supplementary Information 2 demonstrates Im-
mQuant's capabilities in two case studies: murine lung samples during
inﬂuenza infection and human parotid gland tissue in SjOgren's syn-
drome.

4 Summary

We developed Imeuant, a software for studying the composition of
immune cells in complex tissues on the basis of transcription proﬁles.
Imeuant was designed for non-bioinformatician users to facilitate the
immunological interpretation of clinical data and disease models. Im-
mQuant performs well in both human and mouse data, providing the ﬁrst
user-ﬁiendly immune deconvolution application that can exploit the
sizeable number of murine cell-type signatures.

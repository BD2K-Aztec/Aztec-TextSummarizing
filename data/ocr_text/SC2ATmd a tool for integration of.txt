ABSTRACT

Summary: Standard and Consensus Clustering Analysis Tool for
Microarray Data (SCZAde) is a MATLAB-implemented application
specifically designed for the exploration of microarray gene
expression data via clustering. Implementation of two versions of the
clustering validation method figure of merit allows for performance
comparisons between different clustering algorithms, and tailors
the cluster analysis process to the varying characteristics of each
dataset. Along with standard clustering algorithms this application
also offers a consensus clustering method that can generate
reproducible clusters across replicate experiments or different
clustering algorithms. This application was designed specifically for
the analysis of gene expression data, but may be used with any
numerical data as long as it is in the right format.

1 INTRODUCTION

Today’s technological advancements have provided researchers with
an abundance of information, especially in the ﬁeld of molecular
biology. High-throughput technologies, such as microarrays, are
capable of generating overwhelming amounts of biological data.
Due to the large scale of these datasets, non-computational analysis
is unrealistic; therefore, new computational tools and techniques are
needed for the efﬁcient organization and analysis of these data.
Clustering is an important exploratory tool that aids in the
analysis and organization of biological data by dividing the
dataset into smaller, more manageable groups based on a chosen
deﬁnition of similarity. Many freely available applications, such
as the Cluster and Tree View program suite (Eisen et al., 1998),
Hierarchical Clustering Explorer V3.0 (See and Shneiderman, 2002)
and MultiExperiment Viewer V4.0 (Saeed et al., 2006), implement
several standard clustering techniques with a multitude of options;
however, selection of the most appropriate method for each dataset
can be difﬁcult, and clustering results from standard clustering
algorithms are not always reproducible across replicate experiments.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To aid users in the selection of clustering options, SCZAde
integrates two versions of the ﬁgure of merit (FOM) (Olex et al.,
2007; Yeung et al., 2001) with standard clustering techniques.
This creates a Virtually seamless process that tailors the clustering
analysis according to the individual characteristics of each dataset.
SCZAde also implements consensus clustering to address the issue
of cluster reproducibility (Monti et al., 2003; Swift et al., 2004).
Consensus clustering has the ability to identify robust clusters across
multiple clustering algorithms and/0r replicate experiments. Other
features of SCZAde include portable tab-delimited output ﬁles,
the customization of ﬁgures with access to a variety of image ﬁle
formats and implementation of a cluster mapping routine which is
a novel technique that deﬁnes one clustering solution in terms of
another.

SCZAde was designed to aid scientiﬁc researchers in the
analysis of microarray data, and has already proven to be
an invaluable tool in this area. Currently, SCZAde is being
used in the analysis of several large time-course microarray
experiments including the study of phenylpropanoid signaling in
Arabidopsis thaliana, the early effects of osteoarthritis, and the
process of dendritic cell maturation (Olex et al., 2010). SCZAde
has also proven to be an effective teaching tool with its user—friendly
graphical user interface (GUI) and intuitive output that is easy for
students to understand.

2 APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

SCZAde is speciﬁcally designed for the cluster analysis of time-
course gene expression data; however, with correctly formatted
input ﬁles it can be used with any type of numerical data. Two
versions of SCZAde are available. For non—MATLAB users,
a standalone application with a GUI is provided. For advanced
MATLAB users the MATLAB-dependent version allows access to
each m-ﬁle directly in addition to the GUI. This allows a greater
ﬂexibility in the input, output and overall use of the program.
MATLAB .ﬁg output ﬁles provide the ability to customize ﬁgures
within the MATLAB environment (not available for the standalone
version). The ability to export to a variety of image formats such as
J PEG, BMP, EPS, PDF and others is included with both versions of
the application.

2.1 FOM analysis

The FOM analysis enables users to compare the performance of
various standard clustering methods on their dataset to determine
which method generates the most homogeneous clusters. It is

has been shown that highly homogeneous clusters, with respect
to the similarity measure employed, form biologically relevant
groups of genes that have the potential to reveal functional and
regulatory relationships (Jiang et al., 2004; Swift et al., 2004). The
FOM analysis quantitatively determines which clustering algorithm
generates clusters with the highest homogeneity on a dataset-by-
dataset basis; it also suggests the ideal number of clusters that should
be used in the formal analysis (Supplementary Fig. 1). The FOM
(Yeung et al., 2001) and cFOM (Olex et al., 2007), a variation
of FOM tailored for use with Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient, are
implemented in this application.

2.2 Standard cluster analysis

Standard clustering is performed in two steps: (i) the selected
clustering method, hierarchical agglomerative clustering (HAC) or
k—means, is used to cluster all the data once; (ii) each generated
cluster from step 1 is re—clustered using HAC. The second
hierarchical re-clustering organizes the genes so that the most similar
gene proﬁles within each cluster group together in the resulting heat
map ﬁgure (Supplementary Fig. 2).

The standard clustering analysis implements HAC differently in
the ﬁrst clustering step than most other applications, so it deserves
further explanation. Generally, HAC is implemented so that the
entire hierarchical tree is generated from the bottom up; dissection
into subtrees (to obtain clusters) is left to user discretion. However,
the FOM analysis requires the number of clusters to be speciﬁed
in advance, thus traditional hierarchical clustering is not compatible
because it does not specify discrete clusters. In SC2Ade, the HAC
algorithm is instructed to stop building the hierarchical tree at the
appropriate level to generate the speciﬁed number of discrete clusters
for the FOM algorithm. This allows the FOM to identify the optimal
number of subtrees (clusters) that best represent the characteristics
of the entire dataset. Output includes a global hierarchical tree that
relates all subtrees; hence the entire tree can be reconstructed if
desired.

2.3 Consensus cluster analysis

The consensus clustering analysis is based on the algorithm
described by Monti et al. (2003) where robust clusters are identiﬁed
by means of a bootstrapping technique. The consensus clustering
algorithm implemented in SCZAde expands that of Monti et al.
by allowing the user to identify robust clusters—subgroups of
genes that are consistently clustered together—across multiple
clustering algorithms, similarity measures, replicate experiments or
any combination of the three. The option to import and use custom
preclustered data for the identiﬁcation of consensus clusters provides
the user with unlimited ﬂexibility in what types of consensus clusters
are extracted.

2.4 Cluster mapping

Cluster mapping is an analysis technique that describes one
clustering solution in terms of another. Each clustering technique
will represent the data in a different way, elucidating different
biological characteristics. Cluster mapping can identify relationships
between different clustering solutions of the same data. For example,
a comparison between the effects of different similarity measures

can be made where the same data are clustered using Euclidean
distance and then reclustered using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.
A mapping of the ﬁrst solution to the second will give an idea of
how many Pearson clusters are located in one Euclidean cluster or
vice versa. Interesting information about the composition of clusters
generated under each method can be extracted from this comparison.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

All source ﬁles were implemented using MATLAB version 7.0.4.365
(R14) Service Pack 2. The GUI was designed and implemented
using GUIDE in MATLAB. To create the standalone version it
was compiled into an executable using the MATLAB compiler.
Currently, the standalone is only compatible with a Windows OS, but
the MATLAB version may be run on any platform that has MATLAB
installed. Adobe Acrobat Reader and the MATLAB Component
Runtime V72 (provided with the distribution) are required for proper
execution of the standalone application. The current implementation
provides two clustering methods, k-means and HAC, but can be
expanded to include more in the future. Supplementary Table 1
summarizes the ﬁle hierarchy of the entire program, and screen
shots of the application interface can be found in Supplementary
Figures 3—8.

Abstract

Motivation: Stoichiometric and constraint—based methods of computational strain design have be—
come an important tool for rational metabolic engineering. One of those relies on the concept of
constrained minimal cut sets (cMCSs). However, as most other techniques, cMCSs may consider
only reaction (or gene) knockouts to achieve a desired phenotype.

Results: We generalize the cMCSs approach to constrained regulatory MCSs (cRegMCSs), where
up/downregulation of reaction rates can be combined along with reaction deletions. We show that
flux up/downregulations can virtually be treated as cuts allowing their direct integration into the
algorithmic framework of cMCSs. Because of vastly enlarged search spaces in genome—scale net—
works, we developed strategies to (optionally) preselect suitable candidates for flux regulation and
novel algorithmic techniques to further enhance efficiency and speed of cMCSs calculation. We
illustrate the cRegMCSs approach by a simple example network and apply it then by identifying
strain designs for ethanol production in a genome—scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli. The
results clearly show that cRegMCSs combining reaction deletions and flux regulations provide a
much larger number of suitable strain designs, many of which are significantly smaller relative to
cMCSs involving only knockouts. Furthermore, with cRegMCSs, one may also enable the fine tun—
ing of desired behaviours in a narrower range. The new cRegMCSs approach may thus accelerate
the implementation of model—based strain designs for the bio—based production of fuels and
chemicals.

1 Introduction

Recent advances in genome—wide characterization of cellular sys—
tems have allowed the opportunity to catalogue a significant frac—
tion of the metabolic reactions in the cell. These advances coupled
with the development of metabolic modelling methods have enabled
the construction of detailed models for many industrially relevant
microbial hosts including Escherichia coli and Saccharomyces

cerevisiae (McCloskey et 61]., 2013; Monk et 61]., 2014; Nookaew
et 61]., 2011). In parallel, the increasing price and volatility associ—
ated with petroleum—based feedstocks have stimulated the use of
biological processes for renewable chemical synthesis. Together,
these two factors further have motivated the development of compu—
tational methods to guide the engineering of metabolism for renew-
able chemicals synthesis.

Genome-scale strain designs based on regulatory MCSs

2845

 

In the past, several algorithms have been developed for compu—
tational strain design, most of them relying on stoichiometric and
constraint—based models. The latter includes the series of bilevel
optimization algorithms such as OptKnock (Burgard et 61]., 2003),
OptStrain (Pharkya et 61]., 2004), OptGene (Patil et 61]., 2005),
OptReg (Pharkya and Maranas, 2006), CosMos (Cotten and Reed,
2013) and OptORF (Kim and Reed, 2010), which have been re—
cently reviewed (Zomorrodi et 61]., 2012). In all of these methods,
the inner optimization problem involves the formulation of a
genome—scale metabolic model with growth rate maximization as
the objective, whereas the outer optimization involves the identifi-
cation of the specific deletions/additions (represented as binary
variables) that lead to the maximization of the flux to the target
chemical. Typically, duality theory is used to convert the bilevel
optimization problem into a single level mixed integer linear opti-
mization problem with both the primal and dual version of growth
maximization linear programs. Another method based on mixed
integer linear optimization is OptForce (Ranganathan et 61].,
2010), which does not rely on a cellular objective function and
uses instead a reference ﬂux distribution typically obtained from
13C labelling experiments. By solving a series of Mixed Integer
Linear Programming (MILPs), OptForce first identifies all reaction
pairs, triples, quadruples, etc. that must be upregulated or downre—
gulated or deleted to achieve a desired production threshold. In the
second stage, these MUST sets are used to identify a minimal inter-
vention strategy that can lead to desired production levels. Hence,
OptForce has been used to identify lower—order combinations of
ﬂux changes required to obtain a desired phenotype and was re—
cently extended to k—OptForce to include kinetics of a subset of
metabolic reactions (Chowdhury et 61]., 2014). Finally, we have
previously developed an integer—free optimization approach that
considers up/downregulation based on successive linear program—
ming and was shown to be highly efficient (EMILiO) (Yang et 61].,
2011). However, identifying strategies with minimal number of
interventions is still a challenge.

Model—based strain designs based on optimization approaches
have been experimentally validated for lactate, butanediol, malonyl—
CoA and fatty acid production in E.coli, and vanillin production in
S. cerevisiae highlighting the value of in silico strain designs for meta—
bolic engineering (Brochado et 61]., 2010; Fong et 61]., 2005;
Ranganathan et 61]., 2012; Xu et 61]., 2011). However, solutions of
bilevel optimization problems for genome—scale models for cases
with more than four or so modifications are usually computationally
prohibitive, even more if one wants to enumerate alternate interven—
tion strategies.

Other methods for computational strain design are based on
pathway—centric approaches, which also do not involve a cellular
objective function. These methods analyze and design the space of
metabolic behaviours by means of elementary modes (EMs; Schuster
et 61]., 2000; Trinh et 61]., 2009). Examples are minimal metabolic
functionality (Trinh, 2012; Trinh et al., 2008, 2011), SMET
(Flowers at 61]., 2013), FluxDesign (Melzer et 61]., 2009) and CASOP
(Hadicke and Klamt, 2010). However, these methods cannot be
applied to genome—scale networks due to the combinatorial explo—
sion of EMs in large networks.

An alternative approach, which, in contrast, to the aforemen—
tioned methods, seeks to enumerate all relevant intervention strat—
egies, is based on minimal cut sets (MCSs). MCSs represent
reaction/gene knockout sets eliminating all EMs with undesired
phenotypes (e.g. low product yield) (Klamt, 2006; Klamt and
Gilles, 2004). As an extension, constrained MCSs (cMCSs) were
introduced to allow also the consideration of desired phenotypes

to be maintained in the network (Hadicke and Klamt, 2011).
Previously, calculation of (constrained) MCSs required the calcula—
tion of the EMs of the metabolic network in a pre—processing step;
they are used to specify desired and undesired metabolic behav—
iours from which the resulting (c)MCSs can then be determined
(Hadicke and Klamt, 2011). However, a recent study showed the
equivalence between the MCSs of the primal and EMs of a dual
problem (Ballerstein et 61]., 2012). In principle, this advance en—
ables the direct identification of MCSs using the network stoichi—
ometry and flux capacity constraints without requiring the
enumeration of all EMs of the network in a pre—processing step.
However, enumeration of all MCSs in large—scale networks was
still infeasible due to the large number of cut sets (or, equivalently,
of EMs in the dual). More recently, the duality approach was used
to identify the smallest MCSs in genome—scale metabolic networks
as shortest EMs in the dual (von Kamp and Klamt, 2014). Once
the smallest MCSs deleting all undesired phenotypes (the latter
represented by linear inequalities) are identified, additional in-
equality constraints describing the desired metabolic behaviour
(e.g. high product yield with some minimal biomass synthesis) can
be used to filter the valid cMCSs from the calculated MCSs. The
findings in von Kamp and Klamt (2014) highlighted the ability of
these cMCSs to identify a large number of (partially novel) deletion
strategies that are not typically found by growth—coupled bilevel
optimization problems. However, one of the limitations of cMCSs
is that they are limited to identifying only deletion modifications.
Given the recent advances in synthetic biology (Keasling, 2012)
that provide an unparalleled opportunity to manipulate and fine-
tune expression of metabolic enzymes in cells, there is a need to
consider graded regulation of metabolic reaction rates in strain de—
sign methods.

Consequently, herein we present an extended cut—set approach
allowing the calculation of (constrained) regulatory MCSs where
up/downregulation of metabolic reaction rates can be combined
along with reaction (or gene) deletions. We present a modification
by which up/downregulations can be treated as virtual cuts allowing
their direct integration in the existing algorithmic framework of
MCSs. As the generalized intervention strategies may lead to vastly
enlarged search spaces in genome—scale networks, we developed
strategies to (optionally) preselect suitable candidates of reactions to
be considered for regulation. We illustrate this approach by a small
example and then by identifying strain designs that lead to ethanol
production in a genome—scale metabolic model of E.coli. The results
clearly show that using the combined regulation and deletions
allowed in constrained regulatory MCS, one can find strategies that
are significantly smaller relative to the conventional cMCSs involv—
ing only knockouts.

We also present new algorithmic techniques to enhance effi-
ciency and speed of cut set—calculations. For example, the currently
employed two—step approach in which first all MCSs are enumerated
in the dual before the admissible cMCSs (that keep desired behav—
iours feasible) are filtered in the primal system can be integrated in
one step bringing several advantages.

2 Methods

2.1 Metabolic networks, cut sets and desired and
undesired phenotypes

We are given a metabolic (stoichiometric) reaction network with m
metabolites and 11 reactions represented by its stoichiometric matrix
N. The set Irrev contains the indices of irreversible reactions. We

assume that the network is in steady state meaning that the net reac—
tion rates r = (r1, r2, . . . , r,,)T fulfil

Nr 2 0, r,- 2 0 Vi E Irrev. (1)

Undesired (target) flux vectors (undesired phenotypes) can be
defined by a system of t linear inequalities

Trg t (2)

with an appropriate t X n matrix T and t X 1 vector t. These inequal—
ities can, for instance, be used to describe flux distributions having
a product yield below a minimum desired value. Similarly, the
inequality system

Drgd (3)

with appropriate d X n matrix D and d X 1 vector (1 is used to repre—
sent desired phenotypes, for instance, ﬂux distributions with a high
product yield coupled with some biomass synthesis. Note that the
pair D/d will usually contain the negated version of constraint (2)
implying that desired flux vectors violate (2). Hence, the desired
space will be a subset of the complement of the undesired space (e.g.
solutions with high product yield) but not necessarily the full com—
plement since other constraints (e.g. some minimum biomass yield)
might be added to D/d to characterize desired solutions. Therefore,
ﬂux vectors with high product but low biomass yield are usually nei—
ther contained in the undesired nor in the desired space; these irrele—
vant solutions are thus allowed to be deleted or to survive. Note
also that all flux bounds in the system need to be integrated in both
T and D.

An MCS is a support—minimal set of reaction knockouts, such
that no flux vector r in the reduced network can fulfil (1) and (2)
anymore, i.e. the undesired phenotypes are blocked. A constrained
MCS (cMCS) fulfils in addition that there still exists a rate vector r
satisfying (1) and (3). The set of cMCSs is always a subset of the
MCSs.

In the following, we want to generalize this approach by allow—
ing not only knockouts but also up/downregulation of certain reac—
tion rates. Here, an up/downregulation refers to setting a certain
lower (upregulation) or upper (downregulation) boundary for the
respective rate. Combinations of knockouts and up/downregulations
that block the undesired phenotypes will be called regulatory MCS
(RegMCS) and the subset of RegMCSs that keep some desired
phenotypes feasible are the constrained regM CS (cRegMCSs). From
these definitions, it is clear that the (c)MCSs are a subset of the
(c)RegMCSs. Importantly, whenever we use the term ‘cut set(s)’
(non—abbreviated), we refer to unspecific sets of constrained/uncon—
strained or/and regulatory/non—regulatory MCS. For example, if we
say ‘cut—set algorithm’, we mean an algorithm that can compute any
type of cut sets.

2.2 Representing up— and downregulation of reaction
rates as CUtS

In the following, we show that up/downregulations can formally
be treated as cuts, i.e. by knocking out an (artificial) reaction.
This extension will allow us to use available cut set algorithms to
calculate not only (c)MCSs but also (c)RegMCSs. Each reaction i
considered for regulation is modified so that it produces a pseudo—
metabolite M,- (Fig. 1), which is then consumed by an introduced
demand reaction. The rate e,- of this demand reaction is either con—
strained by a lower boundary eLmin (in the case of upregulation;
Fig. 1a) or by an upper boundary eLmaX (in the case of downregula—
tion, Fig. 1b). These modifications force the same upper and

lower bounds also for the rate r,- of reaction i thereby forcing the
up/downregulation of the ﬂux through the corresponding reaction.
We then add a slack reaction (with rate 5,) that produces the pseu—
dometabolite (for upregulation) or consumes it (for downregula—
tion). This modification relaxes the constraints on the ﬂux r,- (the rate
is free in its original boundaries); however, if the slack reaction is cut
(deleted), rate r,- becomes up— or downregulated, respectively. We can
therefore apply the duality—based cut set calculation approaches
(Ballerstein et al., 2012; von Kamp and Klamt, 2014) to this extended
network to identify deletions in ‘normal’ reactions (representing
knockouts) as well as in the added slack reactions representing then
up/downregulations (the introduced demand reactions are not
allowed to be cut). If the up/downregulation of a specific reaction
can contribute to the elimination of the unwanted behaviours, then
the corresponding slack reaction is deleted. The calculation
of (c)RegMCSs can thus be reduced to calculating (c)MCSs in the
extended network. Importantly, the feasible ﬂux space in the network
is not changed by these modifications (unless the slack reaction
is cut).

2.3 Flux variability analysis—based identification of
promising reactions for regulation

The approach introduced above requires specification of the levels
of flux regulation (the eLmin and eLmaX in Fig. 1), which are usually
not known before. Moreover, the addition of pseudometabolites
and demand and slack reactions for all reactions in a genome—scale
model (with possibly different thresholds for the demand reactions)
will quickly lead to a combinatorial explosion of integer variables
leading to poor computational performance. In the past, algorithms
such as FVSEOF (Park et al., 2012) or OptForce (Ranganathan
et al., 2010) have been used to identify reaction subsets that are co—
related to production of a target metabolite, we therefore use a flux
variability analysis (FVA) —based preprocessing algorithm
(Mahadevan and Schilling 2003) to (i) identify a subset of promising
candidate reactions for up/downregulation and (ii) to determine
meaningful ﬂux boundaries (the eLmin and eLmaX) to be used for their
up/downregulation. Accordingly, we perform FVA for (i) the ‘wild
type’ [Equation (1) plus known ﬂux boundaries (e.g. substrate up—
take rate; see Section 3.2)] and for (ii) the ‘desired space’ [Equations
(1) and (3) and known ﬂux constraints] and identify reactions whose
ranges were reduced most under the desired conditions and rank
them based on the extent of range reduction. From this list, one may
then choose (e.g. the top 10) candidates to be considered for regula—
tion. Modifications in these reactions are then introduced as

Genome-scale strain designs based on regulatory MCSs

described above (Fig. 1) with several equidistant boundaries for the
demand reactions e,-; meaningful thresholds are derived from the
FVA analysis in the desired system. Typically, we allow 8—10 reac—
tions to be regulated (both up/down—regulation) at three levels.
Using the algorithm of von Kamp and Klamt (2014), we then calcu—
late the resulting cRegMCSs and identify three or four reactions that
were most frequently regulated in the ‘coarse’ initial cRegMCSs.
Subsequently, for each of these frequent reactions, we specify much
finer regulation levels and then identify the ‘fine’ cRegMCSs with
the least amount of interventions. See Section 3 for details on how
we concretely proceeded in the case studies.

2.4 Algorithmic improvements to enhance efficiency of
calculation of cMCSs
2.4.1 Direct enumeration of cMCSs
In genome—scale networks, cut set calculations will usually have to
focus on the smallest intervention strategies. The two—step method
for identifying smallest cMCSs in genome—scale networks
described in von Kamp and Klamt (2014) identifies first the smallest
(unconstrained) MCSs as shortest EMs in the dual system by solving
a series of MILP problems. These MCSs are then filtered in a second
step to keep only the valid cMCSs. This filtering is done by solving
one linear optimization problem per MCS to check whether the
desired phenotype is still feasible for the MCS [i.e. whether a solu—
tion r exist fulfilling (1) and (3) under the given cuts]. In the follow—
ing, we formulate an alternative approach for the direct
enumeration of cMCSs in one step by integrating the constraints for
the undesired and desired phenotypes directly in one integrated
MILP problem.

The central equation used by von Kamp and Klamt (2014) in the
MILP problem for calculating the MCSs blocking the undesired flux
vectors [obeying Equations (1) and (2)] reads as follows:

11
NIZV Irev _Irev TIZV Vp : 0
N171;- Iirr _ Iirr  vn > 0
W _ (4)
tTW g — c

uE mm,vp,vne 3?", WE ﬂ’,vp,vn,w20,c > 0

Note that, before setting up (4), the stoichiometric matrix N
and the matrix T used for specifying the undesired phenotypes in
inequality (2) have been split to two submatrices containing only
the reversible (NreV and Trev) and irreversible (Nifr and Tiff) reactions,
respectively. The matrices Lev and Iifr represent matrices containing
identity submatrices for the reversible or irreversible reactions, re—
spectively. MCSs are then identified by determining solutions to (4)
having the smallest number of non—zero entries in the variables Vp and
vn (these non—zero entries indicate knockouts in the corresponding re—
actions). Binary indicator variables zp and zn are introduced (together
with the constraint zp,—l— zn, g 1) to represent the non—zero entries in
Vp and vn efficiently and to pose the objective function of the resulting
MILP optimization problem:

q
minimize 2(a),- —l— zni)
i=1

s.t. 

Once an MCS has been found, exclusion constraints (integer
cuts) must be added to the MILP to ensure that this MCS and super—
sets thereof will not be found in later iterations (cf. von Kamp and
Klamt, 2014).

To ensure that the calculated cut sets maintain some solutions of
the desired space, we incorporate the corresponding constraints (1)
and (3) for the desired ﬂux vectors r directly in (4):

0
Nix; Irev _Irev TIZV 0 u 2
NT 1- —1- T-T 0 VP 2 0

0 0 0 0 D S
f d
tTW g — c

u E 0km,vp,vn, r E 3?", w E WA E §Rd,Vp,vn,w,rI,,ev 20,c > 0

(5)

By (5), we thus demand infeasibility of the undesired behaviours
(by finding some minimal solutions for their dual representation)
while ensuring existence of a solution for the (primal) desired behav—
iours. As an additional requirement to (5), we need to express that
reaction rate r,- in r is zero if a cut has been made in reaction i:

r,- g (1 — zpi — zn,)ub,- and r,- 2 (1 — zp,‘ — zni)lb,-. (6)

Here, lb,- and 1419,- are the lower and upper bounds of reaction i.
For this integrated approach, it is thus mandatory to have finite
lower and upper boundaries for all reaction rates, which is, how—
ever, not a limitation since one may set large absolute flux ranges if
the bounds are not known. Alternatively, one may use FVA to deter—
mine these ranges for the desired conditions, ideally under consider—
ation of thermodynamic consistency (Muller and Bockmayr, 2013).
Solving the MILP with the same objective function (‘minim-
ize Z: 1zpi —l— zni’), now subject to (5) and (6), will directly deliver
the cMCSs in one step. Clearly, the dimension of this integrated
MILP is considerably larger than the one spanned by (4), but it
brings two major advantages. First, MCSs need not to be checked
anymore for feasibility of desired behaviours. However, as the LPs
required for testing the found MCSs for feasibility of desired behav—
iours are rather fast, only a minor speed enhancement can be ex—
pected here. The second advantage weights more: since a lower
number of solutions (cMCSs) will be computed by the integrated
MILP, lower number of integer cuts need to be integrated to exclude
previously found solutions [cf. the case study in von Kamp and
Klamt (2014): only 3—6% of the found MCSs are eventually kept as
cMCSs]. We observed that this can significantly enhance the relative
speed of the integrated algorithm compared with the standard ap—
proach, especially at later iterations.

2.4.2 Additional revisions for enhancing computational efficiency

To increase the performance of the whole enumeration procedure,
the metabolic network is usually compressed by removing reactions
that are blocked in steady state and by combining reactions that op—
erate with a fixed ratio into reaction subsets. Both these techniques
have been applied also in von Kamp and Klamt (2014). In addition,
two new techniques are applied here to reduce the search space dur—
ing MCSs enumeration (which can be applied to both the integrated
and the non—integrated MILP): it was already mentioned in von
Kamp and Klamt (2014) that reactions being essential for the
desired phenotypes should be removed from the set of deletable re—
actions as they cannot be part of any admissible cMCS (although
they can occur in the MCSs). For example, if growth is a desired
functionality then reactions essential for the production of a biomass
component should be removed from the set of reaction knockout
candidates. This idea can be carried further by determining also

reaction pairs that cannot be deleted simultaneously for the desired
conditions and by excluding them and their supersets from the
search space [via constraints of the form shown by Equation (20) in
von Kamp and Klamt (2014)]. In principle, this method could be ex—
tended to even reaction triples or higher combinations, but pairs can
usually be very quickly calculated and there is likely to be a trade—
off between the reduction of the search space and the complication
of the MILP through additional constraints.

Another technique is to add constraints ensuring that only one of
the potentially many slack reactions linked to the same regulated
metabolic reaction can be knocked—out at a given time. The ration—
ale behind this restriction is that only one regulatory constraint (one
up— or downregulation) can be active on a given reaction in a
cRegMCS because any additional regulatory constraint would be ei—
ther contradictory or redundant. Both techniques mentioned above
do not affect the resulting cMCSs and are only used to tune the
performance.

2.51mplementation

The calculation of cRegMCSs has been integrated as a new function—
ality in the CellNetAnalyzer package, a MATLAB toolbox for biolo-
gical network analysis (Klamt et al., 2007). The implementation
uses the IBM ILOG CPLEX Optimization Studio for solving the re-
spective MILP and LP problems. Arbitrary intervention problems
can be defined by providing the (i) stoichiometric network, (ii) the
matrices (D,T) and vectors (d,t) specifying the desired and undesired
ﬂux vectors and (iii) the list of reactions considered for regulation
together with their respective ﬂux levels (or the number of intervals
to be used for each regulated reaction). CellNetAnalyzer can be
downloaded from the following website: http://www.mpi—magde—
burg.mpg.de/projects/cna. A separate package containing the
data and script files needed for running the examples discussed
herein can be downloaded from http://www.mpi—magdeburg.mpg.
de/projects/cna/etcdownloads.html.

3 Results

We applied the cRegMCSs approach (i) to a small illustrative net—
work used previously in Hadicke and Klamt (2011) and (ii) to a gen-
ome—scale metabolic model of E.coli (iAF1260; Feist et al., 2007)
where we calculate intervention strategies based on regulatory
MCSs for ethanol overproduction as a realistic application.

3.1 cRegMCSs for a small example network

The small example network (Fig. 2) is used to illustrate the differ—
ences in the type of manipulations identified by cRegMCSs com—
pared with the traditional cMCSs as described in Hadicke and
Klamt (2011). Here, the metabolite P is designated as the product
and we intend to identify intervention strategies enforcing greater
than 60% yield of P on substrate A. Using deletions alone, four
cMCSs can be identified [cf. also (Hadicke and Klamt, 2011)].
These strategies are mainly intuitive and suggest the deletion of
alternative pathways leading to the production of the competing
metabolites D and E. Calculating the cRegMCSs with our new ap—
proach (reactions R4, R5, R7, and R8 were considered for upregula—
tion; for the regulatory levels eLmin and eLmaX’ we considered
equidistant values of 1,2, . . . 10) significantly expands the number of
strategies found to 53, including the purely deletion—based cMCSs
identified earlier. The cRegMCSs suggest in addition strategies com—
bining knockouts and regulations or even those that are purely
based on regulation of one, two or three fluxes (Fig. 2). We also

Fig.2. Illustration of cRegMCSs in a small example network. We assume that
all reactions can be knocked out, whereas the flux levels of reactions
R4,R5,R7 and R8 are allowed to be upregulated with flux minimum thresholds
in [1,2,...10]

notice that there are some redundant cRegMCSs. For example, from
the four MCS5—MCS8 : R4 2 {7,8,9,10} we only need to keep
{R4>: Z 7} and discard the three others (R4 2 {8,9,10}) since the
latter are only special cases of {R4 2 7} and thus redundant. In the
Supplementary Text S1, we explicitly list the 24 non—redundant
cRegMCSs. Afterwards one may furthermore group cRegMCSs into
classes of intervention strategies in each of which all cRegMCSs use
the same combinations of reaction knockouts and regulations but
with different thresholds for the regulated ﬂuxes. For example,
MCS51—MCS53 are not redundant to each other but belong to one
and the same class (up—regulation of R5, R7 and R8). In the
Supplementary Material, we also list the 13 classes of the (24 non—
redundant) cRegMCSs.

These results demonstrate the largely extended space of suitable
intervention strategies when taking not only deletions but also
graded regulation of metabolic ﬂuxes into account. For a condensed
representation, redundant cRegMCSs may be dropped and classes of
cRegMCSs easily identified in a postprocessing step.

3.2 Ethanol production in genome—scale metabolic
network of E.coli

To further evaluate the cRegMCS method and to understand how
the computational complexity changes with the scale of the net—
work, we applied this method to identify strain designs in a gen-
ome—scale network of E.coli enforcing growth—coupled production
of ethanol. We used the iAF1260 model (Feist et al., 2007) with a
glucose uptake rate of 18.5 mmol/gDW/h‘1 and an ATP mainten-
ance demand of 8.39 mmol/gDW/hT1 under anaerobic conditions
(Portnoy et al., 2010). We aimed to find cRegMCSs for anaer—
obic conditions that guarantee an ethanol yield greater than
1.4 mol/mol glucose while still enabling growth with a rate greater
than 0.5 h‘1 [these values are used to specify the constraints of
desired and undesired behaviors in Equations (2) and (3)]. This ap-
proach resembles the cMCSs analysis done in von Kamp and
Klamt (2014) with the difference that we choose a larger minimum
growth rate (von Kamp and Klamt used 0.001 h_1) to enable suffi—
cient biomass yields. As the search space for flux deletions com—
bined with flux regulations becomes quite complex, we use FVA in
a preprocessing step as described in Section 2 to identify 10
reactions that had the largest reduction in their ﬂux range
when comparing the desired versus the entire ﬂux space. For these

10 reactions at 3 levels. (b) Histograms for the case with deletions and regula-
tion of 4 reactions at 10 levels computed in this paper. Note that
all cRegMCSs involve at least one regulation; cRegMCSs using only deletions
(2 cMCSs) require at least seven knockouts

10 reactions, we considered three levels for up— and downregula—
tion. Accordingly, four auxiliary reactions (one demand and one
slack reaction for upregulation and the same for downregulation)
for each level were incorporated resulting in 120 (10 X 3 X 4) add—
itional reactions. The three levels for each reaction were chosen, so
that the flux range calculated by FVA for the wild—type space
would be discretized into four equal intervals.

We then calculated the cRegMCSs for the extended network
and identified 1840 designs with $6 modifications as shown in
Figure 3a. In contrast, for the case without regulation (only cuts)
with same parameters, the minimal number of deletions required in
the calculated cMCSs was seven. There were 11 cRegMCSs of size
3, all of them involving upregulation of PDH. We further analyzed
these 1840 designs and identified the frequency of regulation of each
of the 10 reactions considered for regulation (Fig. 4). The upregula-
tion of PDH at 75% level is involved in over 850 designs followed
by GLYCL (glycine cleavage), RNDR2 and RNTR3c as reactions
that were upregulated in a large number of designs. Upregulation of
PDH as a potential strategy for ethanol production was seen in three
of the four cases identified using OptReg on an earlier model of
E.coli suggesting the importance of this strategy (Pharkya and
Maranas, 2006). It is also surprising that several reactions appear as
upregulation and downregulation targets, although only one is
mostly dominating. In the case of the four most frequently regulated
reactions, only upregulation of these reactions was used in the
cRegMCSs.

To test the sensitivity of the cRegMCSs with respect to the
chosen flux levels for regulation, we recalculated the cRegMCSs
with the same 10 reactions for regulation but varied the predefined
levels. Overall, the results appear to be robust against smaller
changes in the regulation levels, in particular with respect to the dis—
tribution of the regulated reactions in the cRegMCSs (see
Supplementary Text S2 and Fig. S2 in the Supplementary Material).

In the next step, we considered the four most relevant reactions
for regulation identified in the first step (GLYCL, PDH, RNDR2 and
RNTR3) with a finer discretization of 10 instead of three ﬂux levels
and identified 22 006 designs of which over 4000 designs had fewer
than five modifications (Fig. 3b). The distribution of these designs
for the four reactions at the 10 levels is shown in Figure 5.

dehydrogenase; PDH: pyruvate dehydrogenase; PFL: pyruvate formate lyase;
RNDR2: ribonucleoside-diphosphate reductase (GDP); RNTRSC: ribonucleo-
side-triphosphate reductase (CTP) (flavodoxin)

This histogram shows again the importance of upregulation of the
PDH reaction in obtaining strain designs, as upregulating PDH be—
tween 55% and 82% of the FVA range is predicted to occur in over
3000 strain designs suggesting that regulation of the PDH reaction
within a range might force ethanol production. Such a strategy can be
rationalized by the fact that the upregulation of PDH results in pro—
duction of Acetyl—CoA and subsequently ethanol (via aldehyde de—
hydrogenase) as opposed to lactate production via lactate
dehydrogenase.

In most of the cases (29 of the 36 cases where at least one
cRegMCS was found), the strain designs are predicted to have either
two or three modifications (Fig. 5) highlighting again the potential
of cRegMCSs to obtain design strategies with much fewer interven-
tions. In particular, there were two cRegMCSs of size 2, both of
which involved the upregulation of PDH and GLYCL. The identifi-
cation of smaller cRegMCSs with finer level of regulation suggests
the dependence of cRegMCSs on the level of regulation and indi-
cates the importance of the second step with finer discretization of
regulated levels. Finally, removal of redundant cRegMCSs and their
subsequent partitioning into intervention classes (where the level of
regulation is neglected) resulted in 1830 non—redundant cRegMCSs
grouped in 1792 cRegMCS classes (for regulation of 10 reactions at
3 levels) and in 20 804 non—redundant cRegMCSs grouped in 7464
classes (for regulation of 4 reactions at 10 levels), respectively. These
results show that, even when removing redundancies and neglecting
the distinct levels of regulation, the number of cRegMCSs is an
order of magnitude larger than the number of corresponding cMCSs
highlighting further the value of incorporating regulation in generat—
ing a diversity of strategies. Although deregulation of PDH for syn-
thesizing 1,4, butanediol has been shown to be a viable strategy for
making acetyl—CoA anaerobically (Yim et al., 2011), it is not clear
yet whether it can likewise be employed for ethanol production.
Regardless, the results from the cRegMCSs analysis suggest a num—
ber of hypotheses that could be tested experimentally in the future.

4 Discussion

In this study, we have generalized the MCS—based framework to regula-
tory MCSs allowing the consideration of reaction/gene knockouts and
up— and downregulation of reaction ﬂuxes. Using a small example and a
realistic strain design problem in a genome—scale network, we have
shown that cRegMCSs, in comparison to cMCSs involving only reaction
deletions, can lead to (i) a lower number of required modifications and
(ii) an increased number of possible intervention strategies. For example,
in the case of genome—scale network of E.coli, using cRegMCSs we were
able to identify several strategies with only two or three modifications
and 333 strategies that have fewer than or equal to five modifications
compared with the case where the cMCSs requires at least seven dele—
tions. Thus, our cRegMCSs approach increases the choices available to
metabolic engineers for experimental implementation and may thus ac—
celerate the implementation of model—based strain designs for the bio—
based production of fuels and chemicals. Another advantage of
cRegMCSs is that they enable the fine tuning of desired behaviours in a
narrower range which could not be attained by cMCSs alone. For ex—
ample, in the toy network in Figure 2, the cMCSs involving exclusively
knockouts can only redirect the complete ﬂux to P (the yield YP/A is al—
ways 1). An intermediate level of 0.6 g YP/A g 0.8 cannot be attained
but is possible with some suitable cRegMCSs.

Although there are previously developed methods that focus on
the identification of reactions for regulation such as OptReg,
OptForce and the more recently developed k—OptForce, all of them
involve a bilevel optimization problem. Although the OptForce ap—
proach shares similarities with the cRegMCSs approach leading to
partially overlapping results, the nature of the algorithm and of the
solutions produced are significantly different. In contrast to
OptForce requiring two optimization steps, cRegMCSs are calcu—
lated in a single—stage MILP algorithm and all intervention sets up to
a given size can be directly enumerated. In addition, although
OptForce indicates the direction of ﬂux change relative to the refer—
ence ﬂux distribution, it does not specify an optimal level for
up/downregulation. Furthermore, cRegMCSs guarantee a high level
of product synthesis irrespective of the optimality of growth in the
mutant strain. On the other hand, OptForce allows direct consider—
ation of phenotype (metabolic ﬂux) data for the wild type; this nar—
rower specification may help to obtain smaller (because more
directed) intervention strategies.

Although gene or reaction knockouts can normally easily be im—
plemented, it will be less straightforward to achieve, e.g. elevation
of a metabolic ﬂux as suggested by cRegMCSs analysis. At least for
irreversible reactions, overexpression or/and control of the activity
of associated metabolic enzymes will be the first approach and novel
tools of molecular and synthetic biology enabling the facile regula-
tion of metabolic enzymes [e.g. ribosome binding site variants for
fine tuning expression (Farasat et al., 2014; Salis et al., 2009) and
RNA devices for programming expression (Carothers et al., 2011)
and other tools (Stephanopoulos, 2012; Way et al., 2014)] could
provide key technologies in this context. Another (more indirect)
possibility could be to enhance availability of metabolites consumed
in a reaction to be upregulated. Nevertheless, the ability to precisely
upregulate a ﬂux as predicted in the cRegMCSs is still challenging.
Therefore, one may select cRegMCSs that are not sensitive to
the level of regulation. Additionally, cRegMCSs could also be used
as a tool for preselecting promising intervention strategies, which
are then analyzed in more detail in combination with kinetic model-
ling frameworks such as Ensemble modelling (Flowers et al., 2013;
Tran et al., 2008) or ORACLE framework (Miskovic and
Hatzimanikatis, 2011; Wang and Hatzimanikatis, 2006) to eventu—
ally identify the most robust strategies. In any case, cRegMCSs ana—
lysis reveals combinations of ﬂux constraints that will lead to
fulfilment of a given intervention goal and multiple experimental so—
lutions may exist to implement these ﬂux constraints.

A potential limitation of the new method is the largely enhanced
solution space, which forces cRegMCSs approach to focus on a sub—
set of reactions considered for regulation. In this work, we used an
FVA—based method to identify most promising candidates, other
methods such as EMILiO (Yang et al., 2011) could be applied to
identify these reactions as well. In the future, it would be desirable
to develop algorithms that can calculate cRegMCSs without explicit
specification of the ﬂux levels of the regulated reactions (i.e. the rele—
vant ﬂux boundaries are determined directly by the algorithm),
which would also help to avoid calculation of redundant cRegMCS.
Ideally, the algorithm would also select the relevant reactions for
regulation automatically and then determine the respective ﬂux
boundaries to obtain smallest intervention strategies. Another pos—
sible extension to cRegMCSs would be the incorporation of kinetics
in a similar manner as the recently developed k—OptForce algorithm
(Chowdhury et al., 2014).

The combinatorial complexity of cRegMCSs calculation also
guided us to further improve the cut—set enumeration algorithm.
Specifically, the new approach for calculating smallest cMCSs in
large—scale networks directly integrates constraints of the desired
phenotypes thereby avoiding preliminary MCSs that will later be
discarded. In the E.coli genome—scale network, we observed that the
integrated algorithm is more efficient than the standard algorithm
proposed by von Kamp and Klamt (2014). However, relative per—
formance of the algorithms will also depend on structure and prop—
erties of the given intervention problem.

The sheer number of strain designs identified by cRegMCSs
points to another important requirement, namely, methods for the
prioritization of these strains for experimental implementation.
Some of the results obtained in this study suggest that upregulation
of certain reaction ﬂuxes or enzyme activities such as PDH, which
occur more often at multiple levels, might be a more robust strategy
in comparison to other designs. In the future, it will be valuable to
screen cRegMCSs to prioritize strategies that guarantee robust per—
formance (Yang et al., 2015). However, the detailed evaluation of the
impact of regulation of these reaction ﬂuxes or strain designs in gen—
eral require additional systematic evaluation for measuring the ability

of strain designs to make the desired product in the presence of per—
turbations in the regulated reactions. The use of such metrics will be
important to maximize the chances of success during the experimental
implementation and validation of these strain designs.

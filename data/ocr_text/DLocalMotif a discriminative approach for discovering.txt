ABSTRACT

Motivation: Local motifs are patterns of DNA or protein sequences
that occur within a sequence interval relative to a biologically defined
anchor or landmark. Current protein motif discovery methods do not
adequately consider such constraints to identify biologically significant
motifs that are only weakly over-represented but spatially confined.
Using negatives, i.e. sequences known to not contain a local motif,
can further increase the specificity of their discovery.

Results: This article introduces the method DLocalMotif that makes
use of positional information and negative data for local motif discov-
ery in protein sequences. DLocalMotif combines three scoring
functions, measuring degrees of motif over-representation, entropy
and spatial confinement, specifically designed to discriminatively
exploit the availability of negative data. The method is shown to
outperform current methods that use only a subset of these motif
characteristics. We apply the method to several biological datasets.
The analysis of peroxisomal targeting signals uncovers several novel
motifs that occur immediately upstream of the dominant peroxisomal
targeting signal-1 signal. The analysis of proline-tyrosine nuclear local-
ization signals uncovers multiple novel motifs that overlap with C2H2
zinc finger domains. We also evaluate the method on classical nuclear
localization signals and endoplasmic reticulum retention signals and
find that DLocalMotif successfully recovers biologically relevant
sequence properties.

1 INTRODUCTION

Local motifs are patterns in DNA or protein sequences that
occur in a short sequence interval relative to a sequence anchor
or landmark. For example, the peroxisomal targeting signal-l
(PTSl; defined by the consensus [SAC][KRH][LA]) occurs at
the C-terminus of many proteins that localize to the peroxisome.
However, up to 12 residues found upstream of PTSl are import-
ant for localization, but as of yet, no motif is known (Hawkins

at al., 2007; Neuberger et al., 2003). Another example is the
proline—tyrosine nuclear localization signal (PY-NLS) that is
recognized by a speciﬁc nuclear import factor Kap,B2 (Lee
et al., 2006). The PY-NLS contains a highly conserved PY at
the C—terminus of the motif, but residues upstream of this motif
are required for the interaction with Kap,B2. Additionally,
proteins are retained in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) owing
to the presence of the motif [KH]DEL local to the C-terminus
(Elrod-Erickson and Kaiser, 1996). We aim to discover multiple
local motifs that co-occur with these anchors.

Existing motif discovery methods typically aim to discover
over-represented motifs in DNA and protein sequences (Austin
at al., 2007; Bailey et al., 2009; Dogruel et al., 2008; Ettwiller
et al., 2007; Linhart et al., 2008; Pavesi et al., 2004; Redhead and
Bailey, 2007; Roepcke et al., 2006; Thijs et al., 2002), but do not
usually account for positional information and negative data.
The few methods that do use sequence distance or position as
a feature operate on DNA sequences (Keilwagen et al., 2011;
Linhart et al., 2008; Narang et al., 2010; Ohler et al., 2002;
Roepcke et al., 2006; Yan et al., 2011) and are thus unsuitable
for proteins. Discriminative motif finding methods distinguish
functional motifs from randomly occurring sequence patterns
by using functionally unrelated ‘negative’ sequences in which
sought motifs are absent (or present owing to chance alone)
(Redhead and Bailey, 2007). To our knowledge, none of the
available protein motif discovery methods make use of both
types of information.

Several local motif discovery methods are designed for infer-
ring motifs that deﬁne gene regulatory networks (Ohler et al.,
2002; Roepcke et al., 2006; Vardhanabhuti et al., 2007; Xie et al.,
2007). Recently, Narang et al., (2010) developed ‘LocalMotif’ for
discovering nucleotide motifs that occur in a short sequence
interval relative to transcription start sites. They introduced a
novel scoring function to determine the spatial confinement of
a DNA motif. Using human promoter data, the authors demon-
strated that their method outperformed several other tools such
as Amadeus (Linhart et al., 2008), Trawler (Ettwiller et al., 2007),
Weeder (Pavesi et al., 2004) and MEME (Bailey et al., 2009) on
discovering transcription factor binding motifs in ChIP data.
The “spatial confinement score’ (Narang et al., 2010) does not
adequately deal with sparse data. With few samples, the spatial
confinement score is high at singular counts. To make matters
worse, at low numbers of samples under observation, the method

for determining statistical signiﬁcance is inaccurate (\Nilks,
1938). LocalMotif is therefore incapable of distinguishing
between real and spurious, low-count motifs.

In this article, we develop a new method inspired by
LocalMotif (Narang et al., 2010) that works for the 20-symbol
amino acid alphabet enabling protein motif discovery. It uses
negative data enabling discriminative motif discovery, and statis-
tically identiﬁes local motifs at realistically low counts. Our new
method DLocalMotif discovers motifs in a set of protein
sequences that are aligned relative to a deﬁned landmark. We
use three scoring functions, namely motif spatial conﬁnement
(MSC), motif over-representation (MOR) and motif relative
entropy (MRE). To deal with spurious matches, we use pseudo
counts for probabilities in the scoring functions. (Maximum a
posteriori estimates tend to reasonable values when there is
little data.) The scoring functions collectively establish whether
a motif is enriched in a constrained sequence interval in the posi-
tive dataset relative to the negative dataset. To uncover only
signiﬁcant, spatially conﬁned motifs, P—values are determined
by a (corrected) binomial test of motif location within matched
sequences. We believe that DLocalMotif is the only tool for
discovering local motifs in protein sequences. We expect that
several methods, including Trawler and Amadeus, could be
reworked to operate on proteins, but the efﬁciency and accuracy
are yet unknown.

We use synthetic datasets to characterize the accuracy of our
method and to compare it with alternative methods. The results
indicate that DLocalMotif has superior accuracy on protein
sequences largely because of its ability to use positional informa-
tion and negative data. In addition, DLocalMotif ﬁnds the most
favourable position of each discovery. We apply our method to
several biological datasets and uncover novel motifs that
co-occur with a variety of protein localization signals.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

2.1 Motif description language

A local motif is a tuple M = (K, d, R) where K is a ‘consensus’ string of k
symbols from the 20-amino acid alphabet A, d is an integer representing
the maximum accepted Hamming distance, i.e. the number of mis-
matches, between the consensus and a ‘matched’ string (both of length
k) and R is a range [r1,r2] specifying all accepted starting positions of the
motif in a sequence (making it ‘local’).

Our objective function, F(M, X) is a function of a local motif M and
a set of sequences X e {5, U}, each of length L. X is divided into positive
and negative sequence sets, S and U, respectively, with sizes
N X=NS+N U. The objective function decomposes into three
sub-functions described in the subsections later in the text.

Each sequence is aligned to a universal ‘anchor’ position. Speciﬁcally,
we designate b1: 1 to indicate the ﬁrst position of the sequence that can
contain a match to a motif and b2=L - k+l the ﬁnal position for
a match. S[i,i + k — l] is a k-symbol string of any sequence S e X, starting
at i, where i 6 [171,172], i.e. any valid subinterval.

We deﬁne match(S, K, d, i) to be true if and only if
H(S[i, i + k — l],K) 5 d, where H() is the Hamming distance
between two strings. We similarly deﬁne c0unt(S, K, d, [i1, i2])
|{i e [i1,i2]|match(S, K, d, i)}| to be the number of instances that match
K in the interval [i1,i2] of SEX. We deﬁne match(S, K, d, [i1,i2]) to be
true if c0unt(S, K, d, [i1, i2]) 2 1.

We deﬁne i* = argminl-H(S[i, i + k — l], K). When match(S, K, d, [i1, i2])
is true, we use match(S, K, d, [i1,i2])j to access the jth symbol in the
‘matched’ string S[i* +j — l, i* +j+ k] wherej e {1, ...,k}.

2.1.] PrOblem formulation The discriminative local motif ﬁnding
problem is an extension of the local motif ﬁnding problem (Narang et al.,
2010). Suppose that instances of an unknown string K, subject to a
user-speciﬁed maximum of d mismatches, are enriched within a conﬁned
interval R in positive sequences relative to negative sequences. Our goal is
to establish the parameters of M =(K, d, R) leveraging the differences
between positive and negative instances. Below we describe the functions
to objectively score parameter values.

2.1.2 M SC MSC measures a motif’s enrichment ‘inside’ an interval
R, relative to any other position in a sequence.

For a given string K (subject to d mismatches), we deﬁne the set
S* = {S e Slmatch(S, K, d, [b1,b2])} to be all positive sequences with at
least one match. We denote the number of sequences in this set as
Ng = |S*|.

For the same string, consider for each sequence S e 5*, a Bernoulli trial
where we ﬁnd the string either inside or outside an interval R. The prob-
ability of picking an occurrence of K subject to d inside an interval [i1,i2] is
P[,-1,,-2](S) = c0unt(S, K, d, [i1, i2])/ c0unt(S, K, d, [b1,b2]). We deﬁne the set
S’ = {S e S|P[r1,r2](S)} as the sample of positive sequences whose match
is inside [r1,r2]. Note that counting a sequence as having a ‘local’ motif is
a random event. The success of this event is based on the proportion
of matches inside (as opposed to outside) the interval. The expected
sequence count is thus the sum of these probabilities 2565* P[rl,,2](S).
We denote the number of sequences in this sample as Ng 2 IS’ I.

We deﬁne c1 = (N:g + zarMsc)/(N§ + z). z = l/JTMSC is a pseudo count,
and JTMSC = (r2 — r1)/(L — k + l) is the (uniform) prior probability of
observing a string within the interval [r1,r2].

To qualify c1 using known negatives, we similarly deﬁne the sets U*
and U’, on basis of the set U, for sequences with matches anywhere and
with local matches, respectively (analogous to S* and S’). Their counts
are referred to as N}; and N’U, respectively. Analogous to c1, let
62 = (N’U + ZJTMsc)/(NZ + Z)-

MSC is deﬁned as the Kullback—Leibler (KL) divergence (D) between
c1 and c2 (see Equation 1).

(1 — C1)
(1 — 62)

Note that, in the absence of a negative dataset, c2 equals JTMSC.

2.1.3 M 0R MOR is a statistical measure of the abundance of motif
instances in positive sequences relative to a background.

e1 2 (Ng + ZJTMQR)/(NS + z) is the proportion of sequences in S that
match K subject to d mismatches at any position. 2 = l /7TMOR is a pseudo
count, and JTMQR is the prior probability of ﬁnding a match in the
sequence, calculated as follows.

Let 005“ be the (uniform) prior probability of ﬁnding a match at one
position in a sequence. Then JTMQR = P(Zone site) 2 l — P(zero
site) 2 l — (l — 0.05k)LTk+1. e2 2 (N3 + ZJTMQR)/(NU + z) is the propor-
tion of sequences in U that match the string K subject to d mismatches,
at any position.

The MOR of M is measured as the Kullback—Leibler divergence
between el and e2 (Equation 2).

2.1.4 M RE MRE is a measure of the information-theoretic content

of a motif, relative to a background distribution. To capture the
functional importance of residues in a motif, we measure MRE using

background frequencies taken from the negative data. We ﬁrst generate
a probability matrix PM (Equation 3).

P , = — 3

W J) NE + Z < )
PM(a, j) is the probability of observing a in the jth position of the
motif, i.e. n(a,j) = |{S e S’lmatch(S, K, d, [r1,r2])j = a}|. z = I/JTMRE is a
pseudo count, and JTMRE = 0.05 is the (uniform) prior probability of
observing an amino acid a e A.

The MRE is calculated as in Equation 4.

where qa represents the probability of observing an amino acid a in the
negative data irrespective of position.

2.1.5 The objective function F{M,X) The objective function
F(M,X) incorporates three different characteristics of a motif by a
simple geometric combination of the aforementioned scores (see
Equation 5).

FpR0D(M, X) = MSC(M, X)MOR(M, X)MRE(M, X) (5)

We also explored an objective function, which sums all three scores as
shown in Equation 6.

FSUM(M, X) = MSC(M, X) + MOR(M, X) + MRE(M, X) (6)

DLocalMotif tries to ﬁnd M and its interval of occurrence R that
maximizes our objective function F(M, X). Note that in the absence
of negative data, we resort to a uniform background.

2.1.6 Positional weight matrix For searching in novel and
unaligned sequences, we present the discovered motif in the form of a
positional weight matrix (PWM). We construct the PWM, WM as the
‘log—odds’ of the position-speciﬁc probability and a zero-order back-
ground probability of the amino acid a at position j as established
from matching M against S’ (see Equation 7, which refers to Equation 3).

2.1.7 Statistical Significance of motif Narang and colleagues
computed P-values for each score individually. The authors used Wilks’
theorem, presented the likelihood ratio test statistics and estimated
P-values as area under the tail of the x2 distribution. However, Wilks’
theorem makes inaccurate assumptions for computing likelihood ratio if
the numbers of samples are low (which they tend to be for protein
sequences). We use a distinct approach to alleviate such concerns and
to focus speciﬁcally on spatially conﬁned motifs.

For each sequence in X = {S,U}, we perform a Bernoulli trial as
described in Section 2.1.2. We determine the probability of picking a
local string K (subject to d mismatches) in S* and U*, by c1 and c2,
respectively (where ‘local’ means inside [r1,r2]). We note that l — c1 and
l—cz is the probability of picking a non-local string in S* and U*,
respectively.

We calculate the probability as

pBIN = Z ( KS )c§(l — cz)NST". We report the P-value corrected for

the total number of motifs evaluated (Chatﬁeld, 1989).

cumulative binomial

2.2 Search algorithm and implementation

We do not use an exhaustive enumeration strategy because of its
computational demands. For a given value of d, and a range
of k 6 N31, DLocalMotif uses a greedy enumeration: DLocalMotif

ﬁnds all non-redundant k-mers occurring in positive sequences in
sequence intervals with start positions R: [r1,r2] where
r1 6 {1, ...,L — k+ l},r1<r2 5 r1 +6, where 6 is user speciﬁed.

Technically, 6 represents tolerance to local motif shifts. In the extreme,
if no shift is accepted (6 = 0), a sequence proﬁle of the alignment would
sufﬁce to identify the motif. At the other extreme, the motif can shift
arbitrarily over the sequence (6 =L —k+ 1), meaning that no guidance
is provided by an alignment.

From candidate motifs in different sequence intervals, the method
constructs a consensus string and subsequently a PWM, both of which
are used to evaluate the objective function. As the candidate motifs are
being scored in different position intervals, a list of top m scores is
maintained at each position, where m can be set depending on available
memory, here we chose m = 50 in our default setting.

If two motifs overlap by 25% (0.19 2 0.25 as deﬁned by Equation 8)
and share some common instances, DLocalMotif discards the lower
scoring motif. Finally, the best motifs (according to the objective func-
tion) and their optimal PWMs are reported. Importantly, motifs without
statistical support (with corrected P> 0.001) are simply discarded.

In Supplementary Section 4.1, we vary the number sequences and
sequence length to illustrate how processing time is inﬂuenced.

We implemented the DLocalMotif algorithm using the Java program-
ming language. The program is freely available in the form of jar ﬁles at:
http://bioinf.scmb.uq.edu.au/dlocalmotif/. The user can adjust different
parameters to discover motifs and locations, including (i) length of
motif (default k=4—ll); (ii) maximum number of local motifs to be
discovered (default 10); (iii) number of allowable mismatches (default
d=k—3); and (iv) motif shift (default 6:4). The algorithm presents
discovered motifs and identiﬁes their location, the three individual
scores (MOR, MRE and MSC) and the combined score.

2.3 Datasets

2.3.] Synthetic datasets Consider motif discovery problems falling
between two extremes: On the one extreme, sequences are highly enriched
with a particular motif, but motifs are not spatially conﬁned. Such
problems can be addressed by available motif discovery methods. The
other extreme has sequences with only weakly enriched motifs, but when
they occur, they are spatially conﬁned in relation to a landmark. We do
not expect traditional motif discovery methods to handle such problems
well. DLocalMotif is speciﬁcally designed to address the latter type of
problem.

Inspired by the study of DEME (Redhead and Bailey, 2007), we con-
structed two datasets that present discovery problems that lay between
these extremes. Each dataset contains 50 uniformly generated amino acid
sequences each of length L (varied from 30 to 200). We inserted instances
of local motifs each with d mutations in t% of sequences (t% varies
between 10—100%), in an interval R: [r1,r2] relative to each
C-terminus. We further generated data according to motifs with 6 :4
varied uniformly when applicable. It has been shown previously that
MEME and DEME perform equally well with up to three point muta-
tions in planted motifs (Redhead and Bailey, 2007). In the synthetic
datasets, we uniformly chose d to have up to a maximum of three
point mutations. Other variables (r1 and I) were also selected uniformly.
For each length, we generated 50 datasets. Additional details of synthetic
dataset construction are provided in (Redhead and Bailey, 2007).

Negative random problem: Unique local motif instances were
implanted in positive data sequences as aforementioned. The negative
dataset was generated from a uniform distribution, thus negatives do
not contain any useful information. The local motif can thus be identiﬁed
with or without discrimination.

Decoy motif problem: Positive and negative sequences have one or
more local motifs in common. The positive sequences contain one
unique local motif. The negatives thus contribute by identifying motifs

that are not unique to the positives, leaving only one motif to be
discovered discriminatively.

2.3 .2 Biological datasets To evaluate the ability of DLocalMotif
to discover local motifs, we studied ﬁve biological datasets, assembled
using standard data curation practices. Details about each of the datasets
can be found in the Supplementary Material.

PTS1: The PTS1 dataset contains known peroxisomal protein
sequences with actual peroxisomal targeting signals at their C-termini
(positives), and non-peroxisomal proteins with PTS1-like C-termini
(negatives). AS discussed further in Section 3, several studies have
suggested that there are additional, complementary ‘signals’ upstream
to the PTS1, and we expected DLocalMotif to be able to ﬁnd them.

The initial dataset contained 124 positive sequences and 182 negative
sequences identiﬁed by Hawkins et al. (2007). We updated the dataset
with more recent peroxisomal and non-peroxisomal protein sequences in
Uniprot, using the same approach as that of Hawkins and colleagues
(see Supplementary Material). We extracted 15 residues upstream the
PTS1 (or PTS1-like) C-terminus and applied 30% redundancy reduction.
The ﬁnal dataset contained 209 positive and 240 negatives.

ER retention signal: The classical ER retention signal is known to
occur at the C-termini of proteins and inﬂuences their retention in the
ER, possibly in concert with additional signals. We used the C-terminus
as an anchor to align sequences and used DLocalMotif to discover
retention motifs.

We ﬁrst ﬁltered 172 proteins (from Uniprot) with evidence of
ER retention signals. We then extracted 20 residues upstream the
C-terminus to capture additional signals (Qiu et al., 2009). We ﬁnally
applied 30% redundancy reduction on the ﬁltered sequences. The ﬁnal
dataset contained 130 positive sequences. No negative data were used.

Type-1 copper proteins: The type-1 copper (blue) proteins are involved
in electron transport in various systems such as photosynthesis (Giri
et al., 2004). These proteins contain a variable-Spaced motif with
conserved C-terminal glutamine or methionine residues. All positive
and negative data for type-1 copper protein were taken from PROSITE
database (Sigrist et al., 2010). We aligned all protein sequences relative to
the C-terminal residues. The ﬁnal dataset contains 86 positive sequences
and 69 negative sequences.

PY—NLS: The PY—NLS is recognized by the nuclear import factor
Kap,B2. Literature reports a poorly deﬁned motif with a highly conserved
proline—tyrosine pair PY at the C-terminus of the motif (Lee et al., 2006).
We aligned all sequences relative to PY and used DLocalMotif to
discover local motifs that co-occur with this anchor.

We ﬁrst constructed a non-redundant mouse nuclear [NUCPROT;
Fink et al. (2008)] and non-nuclear (from Uniprot) protein set (both
with a maximum sequence redundancy of 30% [Huang et al., 2010)].
We then identiﬁed potential PY-NLSS by matching each sequence with
deﬁned regular expressions (RES) (Lee et al., 2006). The ﬁnal dataset
contained 297 positive (nuclear proteins that match the RES) and 240
negative sequences (proteins with a known location, which is not nuclear;
sequence match the RES).

Bipartite classical nuclear localization Signal: The bipartite classical
nuclear localization Signal (bipartite cNLS) consists of two clusters of
basic amino acids, separated by a linker of variable length and compos-
ition (Dingwall and LaSkey, 1991; Kosugi et al., 2009). We aligned all
nuclear localization Signals relative to the C-termini and used
DLocalMotif to discover complementary local motifs. We expected to
at least recover the N and C termini clusters of basic residues.

We ﬁrst constructed a non-redundant mouse nuclear (NUCPROT).
A sequence redundancy of 30% was also applied (Huang et al., 2010).
We then identiﬁed bipartite cNLSS by matching each sequence with
deﬁned RES (Kosugi et al., 2009). The ﬁnal dataset contained 237 positive
sequences (nuclear proteins that match RES). No negative data were used.

2.4 Statistical enrichment analysis of PTSl motifs

For each discovered motif, we identiﬁed a group of proteins that
‘have-motif’ and a group that ‘do-not-have-motif’. We counted the
number of proteins in each group, distinguishing between proteins that
are assigned a Speciﬁc property [have a Speciﬁed Gene Ontology
(GO) term or taxonomy term] from those that do not.

The null hypothesis for each motif, and each assigned property, iS that
the ‘have-motif’ proteins do not differ in terms of assigned property from
those of the ‘do-not-have-motif’ proteins. Fisher’s exact test establishes
a P-value, the total probability of observing data as extreme or more
extreme, given that the null hypothesis iS true. From this analysis, we
identiﬁed terms that have P: 0.05. The G0 terms were retrieved from
http://www.geneontology.org (January, 2012). The Taxonomy IDS were
retrieved from http://www.uniprot.org (January, 2012).

2.5 Performance metric for synthetic datasets

The synthetic problems discussed in Section 2.5.1 intend to illustrate how
well DLocalMotif discovers planted local motifs in protein-like
sequences. The top motif in each dataset iS used to evaluate the prediction
accuracy. Let Id 2 [r1,r2 + k] represent the actual range used for a
planted motif M and I = [r’1,r’2 + |K’|] be the predicted range for the
top motif with consensus string K’. Similar to Narang and colleagues,
we calculated the accuracy of DLocalMotif by measuring the overlap
percentage (0.p) between the actual (Ia) and predicted (1,) intervals
(see Equation 8).

We compare the performance of DLocalMotif with the available methods
MEME (Bailey et al., 2009), DEME (Redhead and Bailey, 2007) and
NestedMICA (Dogruel et al., 2008). All of these methods ﬁnd
over-represented motifs in unaligned sequences, with no regard to Spatial
arrangements of motifs. In addition, DEME and NestedMICA also
consider background data to ﬁnd motifs that are discriminative.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluating P—values on randomly generated data

Motif discovery methods may uncover highly signiﬁcant motifs
even when tested on random datasets (Harbison et al., 2004).
To allow the user to distinguish between spurious and biological
relevant signiﬁcant motifs, before assessing the accuracy of
discoveries, we set out to illustrate that P—values assigned to
discovered motifs are statistically meaningful. We thus evaluated
P—values on random datasets. We generated random protein
sequences of different lengths, applied DLocalMotif and
extracted the motif with the minimum P—value. In particular,
we varied the length of sequences from 50 to 100 with each
experiment repeated 200 times. The results are shown as Q—Q
plots, i.e a plot between calculated and ranked P—values
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Owing to observed P—value versus
rank spread, we Show that our method neither over- nor
underestimates statistical signiﬁcance.

3.2 Evaluating DLocalMotif on synthetic datasets

We investigated the performance of DLocalMotif discovering
motifs in synthetic datasets containing randomly placed local
motifs. In particular, we studied the effects of varying the
length L of sequences. For comparison, we considered MEME
(Bailey et al., 2009), DEME (Redhead and Bailey, 2007) and

Fig. 1. Comparison of DLocalMotif, DEME (Redhead and Bailey, 2007), MEME (Bailey et al., 2009) and NestedMICA (Dogruel et al., 2008) on
(A) ‘negative random’ and (B) ‘decoy’ motif problems. Each plot Shows the accuracy of discovered motifs as overlap percentage (0.p). Each data point
represents the average (:tstandard deviation) 0.p on 50 independent runs. In all cases, DLocalMotif, DEME and NestedMICA are using positive and

negative data, whereas MEME iS using positive data only

NestedMICA (Dogruel et al., 2008). The performance of MEME
was based on positive data only but DEME, NestedMICA and
DLocalMotif were tested on positive and negative data. In
Figure 1, each data point represents the average 0.p from
50 datasets. The overall accuracy was calculated by averaging
the 0.p for all data sequences. For DLocalMotif, the accuracy
using both objective functions are reported (Equation 51 and
Equation 61).

For the negative random datasets, DLocalMotif achieved
higher accuracy than standard algorithms with average 0.p of
0.831 and 0.791 as compared with 0.15 (DEME), 0.19
(MEME) and 0.16 (NestedMICA) (see Fig. l). MEME either
outperformed DEME or performed equally well, as DEME in
the test that has no additional information in the negative data.
NestedMICA outperformed MEME and DEME for short
sequences (30 residues).

For the decoy motif datasets, DLocalMotif outperformed
MEME, DEME and NestedMICA in terms of average overlap
percentage with an average 0.p of 0.741 and 0.731, compared
with 0.18 (DEME), 0.13 (MEME) and 0.17 (NestedMICA).
DEME and NestedMICA consider negative data and are thus
able to identify decoys. The results further illustrate the ability of
DLocalMotif to discover local motifs that discriminate between
positive and negative sequences, by identifying the motifs that
are only available in the positive data. Note that DEME, MEME
and NestedMICA perform relatively well with shorter length
sequences. However, the overall accuracy of standard algorithms
decreases signiﬁcantly with the increase in the sequence length.
DLocalMotif’s ability to discover local motifs does not change
with sequence length.

It needs to be emphasized that most other protein motif
discovery tools, including MEME, DEME and NestedMICA,
are not designed for local motif discovery. We also believe that
the accuracy of NestedMICA may be improved by optimizing its
setting to each scenario, as is illustrated in previous studies
(Dogruel et al., 2008). As much as possible, we used default
parameter settings, to illustrate the typical behaviour of the
method. We do not claim that standard motif discovery

algorithms are inaccurate, rather point out that they are not
designed for discovering ‘local motifs’ in protein sequences.
When such motifs are discovered, they are discovered to an
extent that is well below that of DLocalMotif. We have shown
that DLocalMotif effectively recovers spatially conﬁned motifs.
FPROD is slightly superior to FSUM as objective function, but
both perform well above the baseline provided by MEME,
DEME and NestedMICA. In the following, we will use the
former objective exclusively.

To check the accuracy of DLocalMotif with increasing
number of background sequences, we planted a decoy motif of
length 8. The total number of residues in each sequence (L) was
set to 100. The number of sequences in the positive dataset was
ﬁxed to 100, whereas the number of sequences in the negative
dataset was varied from 0 to 150 and each experiment was
repeated 15 times. The results are shown in Supplementary
Figure S5. The results indicate that DLocalMotif is highly
accurate when the number of background sequences is 270%
of the number of foreground sequences. This illustrates the tool’s
ability to use negative data.

To investigate how the accuracy of DLocalMotif varies with
extent of motif shift, we performed additional tests on the decoy
motif data. We varied 6 e {6,8,10,12} and ran 15 tests for each
sequence length (see Supplementary Fig. S6). DLocalMotif is less
accurate for shorter sequences (30 and 40 residues) when 6 = 12.
The accuracy is highest when 6 is small and close to the size of
the interval used to plant motifs. A greater 6 (ultimately the
length of the sequence) leads to similar performance as standard
non-local motif discovery methods (Supplementary Fig. S6).

3.3 Evaluating DLocalMotif on biological datasets

We collated ﬁve biological datasets. For the PTS1 and PY-NLS
datasets, we aimed to discover novel local motifs not found by
existing methods. Using the ER retention, bipartite cNLS
and type-1 copper protein datasets, we aimed to evaluate
DLocalMotif’s ability to recover known local motifs.

Fig. 2. Discovered local motifs in (A) PTS1 dataset (B) ER retention Signal dataset (C) PY—NLS dataset and (D) bipartite cNLS dataset. The P—values for
each score are also Shown. The discovered motifs are numbered according to their overall rank based on their combined score. The x—axiS represents
distance relative to anchor. The logos are generated using WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004)

All sequences that contain a match with each discovered motif
were used to generate sequence logos (Crooks et al., 2004).

3.3.1 Discovering motifs occurring with PT SI Figure 2A
summarizes the logos of local motifs and their position relative
to the anchor, as discovered in the PTS1 dataset by
DLocalMotif. We found seven motifs that co-occur with PTS1,
here named Motif 1-7. We validated the position of discovered
motifs using literature.

There is a high prevalence of hydrophobic residues at 5—11
upstream of the C-terminus in Motifl, Motif2, Motif6 and
Motif7, in agreement with functionally relevant observations
(Neuberger et al., 2003). It has been shown in the literature
that in Candida boidinii, basic residues are found upstream of
PTS1 (Mullen and Trelease, 2000), as observed in Motif2,
Motif4 and Motif5. Neuberger and colleagues also observed
basic residues at 1—7 upstream of PTS1. In Motif4 and Motif7,
threonine is prevalent at one and two residues, respectively
(relative to the anchor), which matches with observation of
Neuberger and colleagues.

The MOR of all discovered motifs shown in Figure 2A was
low, whereas the MSC was high. By allowing small variation in
interval length, DLocalMotif was able to discover motifs that are
unavailable to standard motif discovery tools. To investigate
whether motifs are biologically meaningful and (if so) perform
a deﬁned function, we evaluated the statistical enrichment of
the functions of proteins containing the instances of discovered
motifs.

Supplementary Tables S2—8 Show the statistical enrichment
of GO and taxonomical terms of proteins in different groups.
We generated each group by ﬁltering proteins that contain

discovered motifs. Each motif co-occurred with PTS1 independ-
ently of other motifs. Proteins with Motif3, Motif4, Motif6 and
Motif7 are enriched with plant (peroxidase activity, Liliopsida,
Arabidopsis thali ana) and ﬂy (Drosophila melanogaster)—related
terms, indicating that they are prevalent in these species. In con-
trast, Motif 1 contains non-plants terms (D-amino—acid oxidase
activity, Cetartiodactyla). Motif6 is also prevalent in ﬂowering
plants (Poaceae). We note that Motif2 and Motif5 occur in
proteins involved in assimilation of acetyl co-enzyme A
(acetyl-CoA), an essential process in many bacteria that proceed
via the ethylmalonyl—CoA pathway (Erb et al., 2010).

When run on the same dataset, MEME, DEME and
NestedMICA discover either one or at best two motifs similar
to Motif l and Motif3 (see Supplementary Fig. S8).

3.3.2 Recovering known motifs in ER and copper
proteins Using Uniprot annotations to validate, DLocalMotif
successfully recovered 113 of 130 classical ER retention signals.
Using PROSITE annotations, 99 of 113 known instances of
the ER retention signals were recovered (Fig. 2B).

There are a few examples in literature where more than one
ER retention signal is present upstream of the C-terminus (Qiu
et al., 2009). Interestingly, DLocalMotif ﬁnds one motif
upstream classical ER retention motif (see Fig. 2B; Motif2).
The novel motif contains cluster of acidic residues and occurs
at a distance 19 residues upstream the ER retention motif.
Indeed, the literature suggests that proteins that are efﬁciently
retained in the ER are often distinguished by the presence of
acidic amino acid residues at that location (Munro and
Pelham, 1987; Yun and Eipper, 1995). Rose-John et al claimed
that an acidic residue signal (EEDDD) that occurs 14 residues

DLocalMotif

 

upstream the C-terminal of IL-6-PDI contributes to the efﬁ-
ciency of ER retention (Rose-John et al., 1993).

We also tried MEME, DEME and NestedMICA on the same
data: The classical ER retention signal was recovered in each
case, but additional motifs were not found (see Supplementary
Fig. S8).

When tested on type-l copper proteins, again taken from
PROSITE, DLocalMotif recovered 72 of 86 copper ligand
sites. We Show a recovered known motif in Supplementary
Figure S7.

3.3.3 Discovering motifs occurring with PY-NLSs PY-NLSS
are recognized by the transport factor Kap,82. We used
DLocalMotif to investigate the existence of local motifs that
supplement the FY anchor that appear in almost all Kap,B2
cargo. DLocalMotif discovered several novel motifs that
ﬁgured strongly upstream of the anchor (see Fig. 2C).

Motifl, Motif2 and Motif3 occur at a distance 9, 25 and 17
residues upstream the FY anchor. We found that these three
motifs correspond to zinc ﬁnger (Zf) motifs, and a manual
analysis using Pfam (Finn et al., 2010) suggested that they
belong to the C2H2 class of Zfs. Literature evidence also
suggested that Zf domains can efﬁciently act as NLSS and are
recognized by karyopherins (Lee et al., 2000; Saijou et al., 2007;
Yamasaki et al., 2005). We also searched the literature to ﬁnd
evidence of Kapﬂ2 interacting with Zf domains (speciﬁcally the
C2H2 class). We found that ADRl, which contains C2H2 Zf
domains, interacts with Kap104, the Kapﬂ2 ortholog in yeast
(Stark et al., 2006). It is not known whether C2H2 domains
are necessary or sufﬁcient for Kap104 binding.

Motif4 and Motif6 contain clusters of basic amino acids and
are found to be prevalent in the proteins that contain basic
PY-NLSS. In contrast, Motif5 and Motif7 contain many hydro-
phobic amino acids, and our manual analysis revealed that they
are prevalent in proteins that contain hydrophobic PY-NLSS.
(Two more motifs were found but are not shown owing to
space limitations).

One or at best two fragments of the Zf domain were detected
by MEME, DEME and NestedMICA (see Supplementary
Fig. S8).

3.3.4 Discovering motifs within bipartite cNLSs Here, we con-
sider the C-terminus of the bipartite cNLS motif as anchor to
improve our understanding of the variable-length linker-region
and the basic N- and C-termini clusters (Dingwall and Laskey,
1991; Kosugi et al., 2009). Studies have indicated that the linker
region contributes to nuclear localization activity (Engelmann
et al., 1996), but so far, speciﬁc motifs have not been identiﬁed.
We thus used DLocalMotif to discover motifs relevant to nuclear
import.

DLocalMotif discovered three motifs (Motif l at C-terminus
Motif2 and Motif3 at N-terminus; see Fig. 2D). Motif2 and
Motif3 co-occur with Motif 1 containing clusters of basic residues
(see Fig. 2D). Motif l is a purely basic residue motif. Motif2 and
Motif3 are 5 and 9 residue long motifs, respectively, and also
contain basic residues.

We also ran MEME (Bailey et al., 2009), DEME (Redhead
and Bailey, 2007) and NestedMICA (Dogruel et al., 2008) on the
same dataset. These methods were able to uncover only one

motif consisting of basic residues. The spatial conﬁnement of
the C-terminal motif is high, making both motifs easy targets
for DLocalMotif.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we address the motif discovery problem when
motifs are only weakly enriched overall, but biological expertise
suggests that they are conﬁned to an approximate, but deﬁned
position. For example, structural constraints of protein conform-
ation make fragments distant in sequence come together in space.
DLocalMotif discovers such ‘local motifs’ in a set of protein
sequences that are aligned to a predeﬁned anchor, and their
appearance is linked to their position within the alignment.
Unlike similar current methods, DLocalMotif is speciﬁcally
designed for proteins, and to solve problems where negative
data are available.

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we
investigated a series of protein translocation problems where
targeting signals are assisted by additional, often spatially
related, but otherwise more subtle properties. To enable
DLocalMotif to adequately deal with sparse data, we re—designed
the scoring functions of Narang et al. by introducing pseudo
counts. We formulated three discriminative scoring features,
MSC, MOR and MRE. These features establish whether a
motif is positioned in a sequence interval in positive data and
is generally absent in negative data. The new formulation gives
a quantitative evaluation of a motif’s relevance, considering its
over-representation, relative entropy and spatial conﬁnement.
Importantly, our search strategy removed all motifs with
non-signiﬁcant spatial conﬁnement P—values determined using
a robust binomial test of motif location.

Although DLocalMotif has many parameters that can be
tuned, we have shown that default parameters settings are effect-
ive for discovering biologically signiﬁcant motifs. To examine the
performance of DLocalMotif, we planted random negative and
decay motifs in artiﬁcial datasets. The results underscored that
DLocalMotif is able to accurately discover the location of
a planted motif’s occurrence, independently of sequence length.
The results also demonstrated that DLocalMotif will outperform
standard motif discovery algorithms, here represented by
MEME (Bailey et al., 2009), DEME (Redhead and Bailey,
2007) and NestedMICA (Dogruel et al., 2008) when motifs are
spatially conﬁned. It is important to note, however, that stand-
ard motif discovery algorithms are not expected to discover local
motifs any better than non-local motifs, and their performance
thus degrades with the increase in sequence length.

On biological data with limited over-representation of motifs,
DLocalMotif discovered multiple local motifs. We present seven
novel PTS1 local motifs, some of which appear to be
species-distinct. DLocalMotif discovered three entirely novel
PY-NLS local motifs that overlap with C2H2 Zf domains, asso-
ciated with nuclear trafﬁcking. We believe these motifs may
further our understanding of PY—NLS-mediated translocation.

DLocalMotif successfully recovered ER retention motifs and
the bipartite NLS, despite the absence of negative data.
Speciﬁcally in ER retention data, we found a motif consisting
of acidic residues that occurs immediately upstream the classical
ER retention signal. Literature indicates that the same motif may

contribute to the efﬁciency of ER retention. With many motif
discovery tools unable to deal with large motifs with variable
linker regions, DLocalMotif offers a compromise by detecting
multiple smaller but spatially interlinked motifs.

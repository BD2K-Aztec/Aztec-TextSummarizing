ABSTRACT

Summary: The original RootTrace tool has proved successful in
measuring primary root lengths across time series image data.
Biologists have shown interest in using the tool to address further
problems, namely counting lateral roots to use as parameters in
screening studies, and measuring highly curved roots. To address
this, the software has been extended to count emerged lateral
roots, and the tracking model extended so that strongly curved
and agravitropic roots can be now be recovered. Here, we describe
the novel image analysis algorithms and user interface implemented
within the RootTrace framework to handle such situations and
evaluate the results.

Availability: The software is open source and available from http://
sourceforge.net/projects/roottrace.

1 INTRODUCTION

High—throughput measurement of plant roots is a key requirement
in systems biology. The nature of biological experiments means
the observation of many plants is necessary in order to understand
growth processes, e.g. responses to stimuli and hormones.
Traditionally, changes in growth were monitored by manual
measurement of plants. Today, image analysis algorithms are being
developed which allow such measurements as root length, curvature
and/or architectural properties (Armengaud et al., 2009; Basu et al.,
2007; Chavarria—Krauser et al., 2007; Le Bot et al., 2010) to be taken
semi—automatically from an image. Some software also enables
multiple measurements on sequences of images with little interaction
from the user (French et al., 2009; Kolukisaoglu and Thurow, 2010;
Nagel et al., 2009). Such analysis opens the door to high throughput
quantiﬁcation of plant growth.

Previous work has seen the release of such a tool, RootTrace
(French et al., 2009) which is able to measure primary length of
many individual roots, given standard digital camera images of
plants grown on agar plates in growth chambers, as is common
practice. RootTrace is able to record the growth of these roots over
time—lapse image sequences. It is also able to record the curvature
properties of each root trace, with user input only required on the
ﬁrst frame. In this article, we describe important extensions to
the RootTrace algorithms, which additionally allow the counting
of lateral roots, and a new tracking model which is able to track

increasingly curved roots, the addition of which allows different
biological questions to be answered. Both these extensions add to
the high—throughput screening capabilities of the software.

2 METHODS
2.1 Tracing highly curved roots

The RootTrace framework uses top—down, particle ﬁlter—based tracking
methods to trace from a user—deﬁned start point to the root tip. The current
estimate of growth direction present in the tracking model predicts the root
location at each step forward. An appearance model is then used to evaluate
hypotheses of location.

RootTrace version 1(RT1) assumed the root to be growing nominally in the
direction of gravity. The tracker’s motion model was set to move downwards
one pixel (~0.05 mm) at each step, reﬂecting the effect gravity has on root
growth. Gravitropic responses could be observed, but the root could not be
tracked if the root tip bent > 90°. Additionally, some pre—rotating of images
was required to enable RTl to track the complete gravitropic response. There
also exist agravitropic mutants (which can grow in any direction) and some
chemical treatments which can invalidate the original gravity—based growth
assumption. A new tracking model is required to examine these biological
effects, which allows roots growing in any direction to be successfully traced.
A polynomial ﬁt of previous locations is now used to predict the position
of the next portion of root (see Supplementary Video 1), combined with a
‘tabooing’ of previous locations to prevent backtracking.

The user tunes the tracking model via a single, intuitive, ‘blender bar’.
With the bar in the leftmost position, RTl’s gravity dependent model is
employed. As the bar is moved to the right, fewer and more recent points are
used to ﬁt the prediction model, the order of the polynomials is gradually
increased and the prediction is made closer to the current location (Fig. la
and b). This improves tracking of more curved roots (Fig. lh—j). A RootTrace
version 2 (RT2) user is able to match the tracking model to the data to be
analyzed without having to enter a numerical parameter.

2.2 Counting lateral roots

RootTrace has been extended to count the lateral roots on typically straighter
primary roots, which is useful for high—throughput screening. As the tracker
traverses the main root, its orientation is maintained. At each point a linear
mask, 40 pixels long and perpendicular to the root, is read from the image
(Fig. 1d). Plotting all the masks produces a straightened image of the main
root with laterals on each side (Fig. 1e). The average intensity of this
image is computed and anything over a threshold is considered to be root.
Connected components are extracted from the regions to the side of the main
root (Fig. 1e) and sufﬁciently large areas labeled as lateral roots (Fig. 1f).
Laterals need to be >05 mm to enter the detection region. Also, the nature
of connected components means very dense laterals may generate merged
detections at this stage.

grow upwards. Figure 1i and j show results obtained with the blender
set to use models optimized for increasingly curved roots; tracking
improves steadily. The mean absolute percentage error in lengths
measured in Figure 1 j versus a human-measured groundtruth is 2%.

Lateral root detection (e. g. Fig. 1f) was compared with manual
identiﬁcation of emerging laterals by a biologist (Table 1). A true
positive marks a lateral at approximately the right position, on the
correct side. The test was challenging, as the ground truth included
emerging laterals only a few pixels in size whose existence could
only be inferred with expert prior knowledge. Considering this, the
results, especially the ratio of total lateral counts, are encouraging.
This metric is important for high-throughput screening.

4 CONCLUSION

The top-down model-based approach used by RootTrace can now
be intuitively tailored to meet the individual requirements of the
biological data being analyzed. A new, gravity-independent tracking
framework has been included, and a method of detecting lateral roots
on typically straighter roots has been implemented.

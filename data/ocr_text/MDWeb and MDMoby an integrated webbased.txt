ABSTRACT

Summary: MDWeb and MDMoby constitute a web-based platform
to help access to molecular dynamics (MD) in the standard and
high-throughput regime. The platform provides tools to prepare
systems from PDB structures mimicking the procedures followed by
human experts. It provides inputs and can send simulations for three
of the most popular MD packages (Amber, NAMD and Gromacs).
Tools for analysis of trajectories, either provided by the user or
retrieved from our MoDEL database (http://mmb.pcb.ub.es/MoDEL)
are also incorporated. The platform has two ways of access, a
set of web-services based on the BioMoby framework (MDMoby),
programmatically accessible and a web portal (M DWeb).
Availability: http://mmb.irbbarcelona.org/MDWeb; additional
information and methodology details can be found at the web site

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular dynamics (MD) has experienced a long evolution since
its origins (McCammon et al., 1977), being new a mature technique
that allows to obtain accurate pictures of the dynamics of proteins
and nucleic acids. Unfortunately, the practical use of MD is limited
by three factors: (i) force-ﬁelds uncertainties; (ii) the need of large
computational resources; and (iii) the high-level expertise needed
to use efﬁciently the technique. Indeed, setting up a system for
simulation requires a large series of operations, and a number of
decisions that demand a signiﬁcant degree of expertise and large
amounts of human time, in most cases similar to that of computing
the trajectory. The end result is that newcomers to the ﬁeld face
a stiff learning curve. These problems reach a maximum in high—
throughput projects (Meyer et al., 2010; Rueda et al., 2007; Van

der Kamp et al., 2010), where thousands of trajectories need to be
launched and supercomputer resources are required.

We present here a tool designed to help na'1've users to completely
prepare systems for simulation, and that allows expert users to
use MD in the high—throughput regime. The tool is presented in
two different versions: a web-services-oriented software platform
(MDMoby), and a web portal MDWeb. The technology has
been adapted to be accessed as web-services following BioMoby
(www.bi0m0by.0rg; BioMoby Consortium, 2008). MDMoby can
be run with usual web-services clients and also programmatically
through suitable APIs (http://inb.bsc.es). In turn, the web portal
MDWeb provides a friendly environment to setup new systems,
run test simulations and perform analysis within a guided interface.
Setup ﬁles can be prepared, at present time, for Amber (Case
et al., 2010), NAMD (Phillips et al., 2005) and Gromacs (Hess et al.,
2008), and analyses can be carried out from trajectories written
in the most usual formats. Additionally, the platform is interfaced
to our ﬂexibility analysis software FlexSerV, so providing coarse-
grained simulation, and advanced analysis tools (Camps et al., 2009;
Emperador et al., 2008), and also with our MODEL database (Meyer
et al., 2010).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 MDMoby

MDMoby services have been developed under the BioMoby
framework (www.bi0m0by.0rg; BioMoby Consortium, 2008). To
this end, a complete new set of data types was designed (see
MDWeb help section for a detailed information about MDMoby
ontology). Among them, the most relevant are MD_Topology,
MD_Structure and MD_Trajectory, that contain information on
topologies, structures and trajectory ﬁles, respectively. Those data
types have been deﬁned in an abstract form, and specialized in
the inherited objects. Hence, data formats are inferred from object
name and handled without user intervention. Setup services cover
operations like structure repair, titration of ionizable residues and
relevant water molecules, neutralization of the system, addition of
salt and solvent, energy minimization, thermalization and system
equilibration. A limited set of parameterized ligands are available to

be included in the setup process. Full automatic setup procedures
in standard conditions for the software packages covered are
offered as pre-packed workﬂows. Underlying software is based
in the AmbertOOls (Case et al. 2010) and VMD (Humphrey
et al. 1996) packages, combined with in-house and publicly
available programs (Supplementary Table Sl). The tOOl allows
launching test simulations in our servers, and provides the necessary
scripts for running production simulations at the user side. Scripts
provided contain the necessary instructions tO be customized tO
match the users’ conﬁguration. Basic analysis results are provided
from AmbertOOls and Gromacs tOOls, complemented with in—house
software. Tools for conversion between trajectory formats are
available tO facilitate trajectory sharing, extension and analysis.
Supplementary Tables S2 and S3, and MDWeb site’s help show
the full Offer Of web-services and operations available.

MDMOby is accessible through Perl and Java APIs provided by
the Spanish National Institute Of Bioinformatics (http://inb.bsc.es),
and, in a limited extent, using clients like Taverna (Hull et al., 2006)
or Jorca (Martin-Requena et al., 2010). Supplementary Figure Sl
shows a sample Perl script tO prepare Of a protein system using
MDMOby.

2.2 MDWeb

MDWeb is a web portal implemented in PHP and MySQL that
provides a GUI tO MDMOby. It provides users with a personal
workspace where intermediate data, trajectories and analysis results
can be stored. Registration is free but necessary tO maintain a
permanent workspace. The primary entry is a structure (uploaded
or obtained from PDB) for setup or a trajectory for analysis.
The input structure or trajectory acts as the root Of a tree (see
Supplementary Figure S2 for some screenshots) tO that new sets
Of data are added according tO the operations performed. Every
new component Of the tree is identiﬁed by its BiOMOby’s data-
type, and can be visualized (with M0], http://www.ijl.Org),
or downloaded. For every component the appropriate choice Of
operations is presented. TO guide the non-experts, pre-packed
workﬂows including recommended options are also available.
However, all web-services in MDMOby are available separately,
allowing more experienced users tO ﬁnely tune the procedures.
Results Of trajectory analysis are presented through alphanumerical
values, 2D plots or JmOl-based 3D visualizations, as appropriate.
Analysis results can also be downloaded for further processing.
Trajectories from the MODEL library (Meyer et al., 2010) can also
be loaded in MDWeb and analyzed. MDWeb handles efﬁciently
potentially slow operations, which are derived tO a batch queue tO
be executed. Results become available in the workspace as soon as
calculations are ﬁnished and can be recovered at a later time.

3 CONCLUSIONS

The software platform formed by MDMOby and its portal MDWeb
provides a step forward in the current Offer Of software tO help in the

use Of MD. It is a consequence Of the automation required tO develop
the MODEL prOj ect and integrates the expertise accumulated over the
years on massive setup Of systems and analysis Of MD trajectories.
The mOdular nature Of the web-service paradigm in which the
platform is created assures that the system can grow tO incorporate
new Operations without a signiﬁcant change Of the interface or even
tO incorporate MDMOby services tO user’s codes. The platform
provides non-experts users Of pre-packed tOOls allowing tO (10
complete MD analysis without a deep knowledge Of the details
involved. At the same time, the platform is ﬂexible enough as tO
allow expert users tO perform ﬁnely tuned simulations. The platform
is not tied tO a speciﬁc software package, therefore increasing the
number Of potential users and helping them in code-migration and
re-use Of trajectories. MDMOby and MDWeb constitute a growing
platform where eventually new Operations and scenarios will be
included in the future.

Abstract

Motivation: Developmental DNA elimination occurs in a wide variety of multicellular organisms,
but ciliates are the only single—celled eukaryotes in which this phenomenon has been reported.
Despite considerable interest in ciliates as models for DNA elimination, no standard methods for
identification and characterization of the eliminated sequences are currently available.

Results: We present the Paramecium Toolbox for lnterspersed DNA Elimination Studies (ParTIES), de—
signed for Paramecium species, that (i) identifies eliminated sequences, (ii) measures their presence in
a sequencing sample and (iii) detects rare elimination polymorphisms.

Availability and implementation: ParTIES is multi—threaded Perl software available at https://

 

github.com/oarnaiz/ParTIES. ParTIES is distributed underthe GNU General Public Licence v3.

1 Introduction

Programmed DNA elimination during somatic development is widely
distributed in animal species. First discovered by Boveri in ascaris
worms in the 19th century, the phenomenon has to date been
characterized in multiple species of nematodes, insects, arachnids,
crustaceans, lampreys, fish, birds and mammals, and can involve the
programmed reduction of up to 85% of the genome (review: Wang
and Davis, 2014). Ciliates, the only unicells that undergo somatic
DNA elimination, resemble animals in that they make a germ/soma
distinction. One or more diploid germ line nuclei and a polyploid som-
atic nucleus coexist in a unique cytoplasm. Only the somatic nucleus is
transcriptionally active during vegetative growth. As in metazoans,
somatic DNA elimination in ciliates can silence transposable elements
and cellular genes (Chen et al., 2014), regulate gene dosage (Nowacki
et al., 2010) and determine mating type (Cervantes et al., 2013; Singh
et al., 2014).

Among ciliates, Paramecium is an outstanding model to study
DNA elimination. Sexual processes are readily controlled under labora—
tory conditions and a third of the germ line genome is lost through two

types of reproducible, programmed deletions: (i) repeated sequences
are heterogeneously eliminated leading to chromosome fragmentation;
(ii) single copy elements, called Internal Eliminated Sequences (IESs),
are precisely excised. Somatic DNA is also endoreplicated to reach N
800 haploid copies. As the 45 000 IESs in the Paramecium tetraurelia
genome interrupt non—coding and coding sequences (Arnaiz et al.,
2012), their elimination is essential to reconstitute open reading frames
(ORFs). Both types of DNA elimination depend on a piggyBac domes—
ticated transposase (named PiggyMac) (Baudry et al., 2009), which
may be guided by short—RNA driven epigenetic signals (Lepére et al.,
2008, 2009).

Cost decrease in High Throughput Sequencing (HTS) is allowing
researchers to produce massive genome—wide data to study DNA elim—
ination, but specific bioinformatic methods are still lacking. Here we
describe ParTIES: Paramecium Toolbox for IES Interspersed DNA
Elimination studies. With Illumina DNA—Seq paired—end reads and a
somatic reference genome as input, ParTIES performs IES identifica-
tion, quantitates their presence in the sample and detects rare excision
polymorphisms. Benchmarks are provided in Supplementary Materials.

2 Description

Given an input somatic reference genome and any Illumina DNA-
Seq sample, be it from germ line or from somatic DNA, ParTIES
provides 3 complementary methods which can be run consecutively
or independently (Fig. 1).

2.1 Insertion identification

IES identification is important not only for mechanistic studies of DNA
elimination, but also to investigate IES origin and evolution across
Paramecium species. IES identification is a 2—step process. First, an ex—
haustive list of potential insertion sites is compiled by Method
of Identification by Alignment Anomalies (MIRAA). Second, Method
of Identification by Comparison of Assemblies (MICA) determines the
insertion sequences and their positions. MIRAA uses read mapping to
detect an excess of read ends at a given site. Partially mapped reads are
presumed to contain additional sequence. Reads that perfectly match
the somatic reference at these sites are discarded. The filtered reads are
assembled with Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) to produce contigs
potentially containing IESs. MICA carries out global comparison of the
contigs and the somatic reference, followed by local realignment to de—
fine inserted segments precisely. Optionally for Paramecium, the local
alignments can be further adjusted to ensure that the ends of the in—
serted segments conform to the PiggyMac cleavage requirements,
namely that insertions be bounded by TA dinucleotides. The IES identi—
fication output is a standard GFF3 file.

The above procedure may be simplified if the user already has
an assembly containing insertions (such as a germ line reference
genome) or if Velvet is not suitable for the available sequencing
data, which the user can optionally assemble with a preferred
protocol.

Fig. 1. ParTlES toolbox. Somatic and germ line genomes are evoked by solid
black lines with exons (grey boxes) and IES (red box). The dark blue regions
represent alignment of Illumina short reads on reference somatic (upper) and
germ line (lower) genomes. Arrows in the insets represent mapped reads.
MIRAA identifies breakpoints based on excess read coverage and MICA iden-
tifies insertions by comparing contigs, assembled from the input reads, to the
reference somatic genome; together they output a list of lESs found in a sam-
ple. MIRET uses alignments of the short reads to measure IES retention in a
sample while MILORD looks for rare deletions in the reads indicative of exci-
sion polymorphism

2.2 Excision characterization
2.2.1 IES retention
Many experiments are designed to see whether IESs are excised or
retained in the somatic genome after experimental depletion of a
factor potentially involved in DNA elimination. The Method of IES
Retention (MIRET) module was designed to quantitate the presence
of each IES in the genome given a DNA—Seq sample. MIRET uses
alignment of the sample reads on the somatic reference to count
reads that cross the IES excision junction, designated IES' reads.
MIRET uses alignment of the reads on an IES—containing reference
to count reads crossing the junction between an IES and its flanking
sequence, designated IES+ reads. MIRET then calculates a ‘bound—
ary score’, defined as the ratio of IES+ reads over the sum of IES'
and IES+ reads for that boundary. MIRET can also calculate an ‘IES
retention score’ that uses the same counts as the boundary score,
with the additional restriction that a read that crosses both ends of
an IES is counted only once in the IES retention score calculation.
Determination of the statistical significance of a retention score
requires a control sample, provided by sequencing the somatic DNA
of untreated cells. Comparison of retention scores of the experimen-
tal and control samples is performed to test the null hypothesis that
a given IES has the same retention score in both samples. The statis—
tical tests are provided by the R environment and take into account
read depth (cf. Sup Mat for details).

2.2.2 Rare deletion events

The IES excision machinery is error—prone and sometimes deletes a
segment of somatic DNA or uses an alternative boundary during
elimination of a bona fide IES (Duret et al., 2008). In order to cata—
logue these events and evaluate their frequency, we developed the
Method of Identification and Localization of Rare Deletions
(MILORD) module. MILORD looks for a deletion in a read com—
pared to a reference genome. It identifies partially mapped reads and
then tries to realign the unmapped part of the read. If a coherent
unique alignment is found, a deletion segment is recorded.

3 Discussion

We benchmarked ParTIES using real and simulated data with the P.
tetraurelia 72 Mb somatic reference genome (Aury et al., 2006) and
IES reference set (Arnaiz et al., 2012). The results are presented in
Supplementary Materials, and can be used to plan optimal, cost—ef—
fective sequencing experiments. We found the minimal requirement
for high sensitivity and specificity IES identification and excision
quantification is 35X sequencing of a short—insert library of 75 nt
paired—end reads, provided the sequencing sample contains at least
25% germ line DNA.

The ParTIES package is expected to set the standard for quanti—
tative analysis of Paramecium genomes and DNA elimination.

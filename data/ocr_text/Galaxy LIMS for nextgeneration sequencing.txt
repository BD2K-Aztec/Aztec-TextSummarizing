ABSTRACT

Summary: We have developed a laboratory information management
system (LIMS) for a next-generation sequencing (NGS) laboratory
within the existing Galaxy platform. The system provides lab techni-
cians standard and customizable sample information forms, barcoded
submission forms, tracking of input sample quality, multiplex-capable
automatic flow cell design and automatically generated sample sheets
to aid physical flow cell preparation. In addition, the platform provides
the researcher with a user-friendly interface to create a request,
submit accompanying samples, upload sample quality measurements
and access to the sequencing results. As the LIMS is within the Galaxy
platform, the researcher has access to all Galaxy analysis tools and
workflows. The system reports requests and associated information to
a message queuing system, such that information can be posted and
stored in external systems, such as a wiki. Through an API, raw
sequencing results can be automatically pre-processed and uploaded
to the appropriate request folder. Developed for the Illumina HiSeq
2000 instrument, many features are directly applicable to other
instruments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has enabled researchers to
sequence large numbers of samples. For example, one ﬂow cell
on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 sequencer can sequence 192 samples
using the 24 standard Illumina multiplexing indexes or more with
alternative barcoding methods. Challenges for sequencing facil-
ities and small labs include tracking sequencing requests, individ-
ual samples, sample status throughout the sequencing process
and the resultant data, including the interpretation of the results.

Public and commercial laboratory information management
systems (LIMSs) exist to track NGS samples. GnomEx (Nix
et al., 2010), for example, is an excellent open-source resource
for NGS and microarray LIMS. Both GnomEx and openBIS
(Bauch et al., 2011) provide complete solutions for more than
NGS data organization, such as imaging, microarray and

proteomics data. GnomEx includes its own data processing
and analysis tools for use within the platform. In contrast to
these platforms, our aim was to build a light-weight yet effective
NGS LIMS within an established data processing and analysis
platform.

The Galaxy platform (Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al.,
2005; Goecks et al., 2010) is a widely used easy-to-setup platform
for the analysis of NGS and genomic data. Here, we extended
Galaxy’s basic sample-tracking capability into a user-friendly
and flexible LIMS, able to handle multiple samples per request.
Furthermore, we enabled more reporting capabilities by ex-
tending the existing Galaxy notification system to update exter-
nal systems (e.g. wikis) with sequencing request and status
information. Our approach is in part similar to the extension
by B. Chapman (http://bcbio.wordpress.com/20ll/Ol/ll/next-
generation-sequencing-information-management-and-analysis-
system-for-galaxy/), but greatly differs in its implementation for
creating requests, samples and data processing.

2 USER WEB INTERFACE

2.1 Request submission

The researcher is presented with a customized request creation
form, which is pre—programmed to support common sequencing
protocols, including genome and exome sequencing, ChIP-Seq
and transcriptome sequencing. Added fields allow input at pre-
defined sample information points and the user is assisted in the
input of appropriate parameters. In all cases, user input is vali-
dated. For example, submissions including total RNA samples
are checked for bad RNA Integrity Numbers and will be marked
accordingly. After completing the required information boxes,
the user is able to upload quality control files, such as Agilent
Bioanalyzer trace images. After upload, the user and lab admin-
istrator can view and analyze the information like any other
Galaxy dataset. To complete the new request, the user clicks
‘submit’ and is then able to print a new request submission
form, which is barcoded with the request id, lists all user-
provided information and has a predeﬁned boilerplate, which
can be signed and sent to the lab with the samples.

2.2 Request processing

The administration interface allows the lab administrator to
modify requests and sample forms, control user requests, add
and manage datasets and design and submit ﬂow cells for
sequencing. An administrator can deﬁne new request types and

cells. In the main window samples can be dragged-and-dropped into the
ﬂow cell lanes; duplicate indexes are marked red

can define the associated new sample information forms to cap-
ture the information necessary to process the new request.
Sample quality and library preparation information can be
added to the system and can be made visible to the customer.
Furthermore, an administrator can change, correct and reject all
information.

The system supports lab administrators with an interactive
ﬂow cell layout (see Fig. 1). During layout, samples to be
added can be searched based on any form value, state or read
length. Once selected, these samples can be manually dragged-
and-dropped into a flow cell layout or automatically placed
based on the request and compatible multiplexing indexes. On
the ﬂow cell, samples are displayed with their index, if present,
and the suggested dilution for correct clustering is shown if
sample quality information has been provided. After saving the
layout, an administrator can edit the ﬂow cell to add or re-
arrange samples. Once complete, the ﬂow cell can be submitted,
putting all samples in the ‘ﬂow cell prepared’ state. After sequen-
cing, the ﬂow cell is set to ‘completed’, which subsequently up-
dates all sample states. For each flow cell, the administrator can
retrieve and print a sample sheet from the web interface, which
lists the ﬂow cell overview and the suggested dilutions.

2.3 Data handling and analysis

On creation of a request, a private data library is created within
the Galaxy system, owned by the submitter and accessible by
administrators. All data related to this request, quality data up-
loaded by the customer or administrator, raw and analyzed
sequencing results, will be stored within this data library. This
provides users and lab personal quick access and minimizes the
need to send the resultant large datasets. In addition to request-

specific data, a library for each ﬂow cell is created to which data,
like scanned lab protocols, can be uploaded.

A script watches the directory into which raw sequencing data
are written. The script detects completed sequencing runs and
retrieves the correct sample sheet from the Galaxy system.
With the sample sheet, Illumina’s CASAVA software is automat-
ically started and the resulting fastq files are uploaded to the
corresponding submitter data library. Depending on conﬁgur-
ation, samples will be automatically analyzed by predefined
workﬂows.

The Galaxy platform integrates many published and publicly
available tools, including both genomic and NGS processing,
analysis and interpretation tools. Because the datasets are
derived within the Galaxy framework, researchers can directly
analyze the data with the Galaxy tools. Researchers can upload
additional datasets into their private workspace, for analysis and
integration with existing sequencing data. Finally, as provided by
the Galaxy framework, analysis steps, workﬂows and datasets
are tracked, saved and can be easily exported from and imported
to other Galaxy instances.

3 CONCLUSION

The presented work provides a lightweight sample-tracking
system aimed at NGS centers with one or more next-generation
sequencers. The system has been optimized for the Illumina
HiSeq 2000 system. With barcoding, multiplexing support and
assisted ﬂow cell design, this system can be directly deployed at
facilities that provide sequencing to internal or external clients.
In addition, due to its ﬂexibility and open access code, the system
can be easily adapted for other core facility services. Developed
inside the Galaxy framework, the user has access to a huge set of
evolving and improving processing, analysis and interpretation
tools.

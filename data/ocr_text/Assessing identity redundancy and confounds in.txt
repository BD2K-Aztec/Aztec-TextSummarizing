ABSTRACT

Motivation: The Gene Ontology (G0) is heavily used in systems biol-
ogy, but the potential for redundancy, confounds with other data
sources and problems with stability over time have been little
explored.

Results: We report that GO annotations are stable over short periods,
with 3% of genes not being most semantically similar to themselves
between monthly GO editions. However, we find that genes can alter
their ‘functional identity’ over time, with 20% of genes not matching to
themselves (by semantic similarity) after 2 years. We further find that
annotation bias in GO, in which some genes are more characterized
than others, has declined in yeast, but generally increased in humans.
Finally, we discovered that many entries in protein interaction data-
bases are owing to the same published reports that are used for GO
annotations, with 66% of assessed GO groups exhibiting this
confound. We provide a case study to illustrate how this information
can be used in analyses of gene sets and networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000; Camon et al.,
2003) is a key means by which systems biologists operationalize
gene function, making it a heavily relied on tool in innumerable
analyses and data interpretation exercises. Although GO annota-
tions are often used as a gold standard, it has widely appreciated
imperfections. Ironically, it is difficult to assess the properties of
GO itself, as there is no other comprehensive gold standard
against which to hold it. Broadly speaking, assessment of G0
has focused on three distinct attributes: the accuracy of annota-
tions assigned to GO, GO’s structure independent of annotation
and the utility of GO and its annotations for the interpretation of
data.

Although G0 was initially conceived as providing explicit def-
initions of gene function concepts (Lewis, 2005), GO can also be
thought as defining each function by the genes that have a

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

particular GO term assigned to them (in the field of logic, this is
the distinction between ‘intensional’ and ‘extensional’ definitions).
Despite misgivings about the incompleteness of GO annotations
(Thomas et al., 2012), the use of GO ‘sets’ as representing “func-
tions’ is now endemic. This is put to use in numerous applications
such as ‘ gene group enrichment’ (Subramanian et al., 2005), gene
network analysis and gene function prediction (Gillis and Pavlidis,
2011a; Warde—Farley et al., 2010). It is essential to understand the
extent to which such applications are valid.

There have been multiple assessments of GO annotation cor-
rectness, often focusing on subsets of annotations (Andorf et al.,
2007; Devos and Valencia, 2001; Naumoff et al., 2004; Park
et aL, 2005; Schnoes et aL, 2009; Skunca et aL, 2012)
Assessment of GO’s structure independent of annotation has
tended to focus on issues of redundancy within the ontology
structure; that is, using different names for the same concept
or different concepts for the same name (Alterovitz et al.,
2007; Onsongo et al., 2008). To the extent assessment of GO
and its annotations are considered together, it is almost exclu-
sively in the context of gene group enrichment analyses (Gross
et al., 2012; Grossmann et al., 2007; Jantzen et al., 2011; Yang
et al., 2011). In comparison, there has been little attention given
to the changing or redundant role of individual genes within GO,
rather than the changing or redundant role of functions. This
article is an attempt to address this gap.

We describe a series of evaluations that take the approach of
assuming that GO annotations are correct, focusing instead on
whether they can be considered meaningful. We do this by
performing three types of “sanity checks’ of GO annotations
that would be expected to hold.

We first explore whether each gene has a consistent functional
identity between versions of GO. We then consider the degree
to which GO assignments are distributed unequally among
genes and how this has changed over time. This annotation bias
is crucial to assigning appropriate priors to the probability a gene
might appear in a functional analysis by chance (Gillis and
Pavlidis, 2011a; Greene and Troyanskaya, 2012). Finally, we
study the degree to which GO can be safely integrated with net-
work data without confounds that would lead to misleading con-
clusions or circular reasoning. To illustrate how our analyses can
be applied, we close with a biologically motivated case study. Our
results provide novel insights leading to a speciﬁc set of recom-
mendations for both the developers of GO and its users.

Identity and confounds in the Gene Ontology

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Historical analyses

GO ﬁles were obtained from the GO FTP site. The G0 was processed
from the ‘termdb’ rdf—xml ﬁles. The G0 annotations (GOA) were from
the monthly GOA ﬁles for human genes (from the FBI FTP site), releases
1—103 (releases 26 and 53 were not available, and releases 39 and 41 failed
quality control), covering a 10-year period from November 2001 to
November 2011. For each GOA ﬁle, an ‘xref’ ﬁle was matched based
on the edition number, and a termdb ﬁle was matched based on the
modiﬁcation date of the GOA ﬁle and the date embedded in the
termdb ﬁle name (using the ﬁle from the ﬁrst day of the nearest month
prior to that of the GOA ﬁle; in a few cases, we had to use termdb ﬁles
from the next later date, as the earliest ones do not seem to be available).
The termdb ﬁles were used to infer the ancestor terms in the GO hier-
archy (excluding the three GO root terms and any obsolete terms). All
annotations are thus up-propagated using the matching edition of the GO
hierarchy. Yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) genes annotations were
obtained from the GO archives and the Saccharomyces Genome
Database FTP site (discontinuities between data from these two sources
were resolved in Figure 2B by alignment of neighboring time points).
Genes were matched across editions using NCBI gene IDs and gene
symbols. IEA annotations were ignored or irrelevant to all analyses,
except for Figure 2, where they were retained. Semantic similarity was
measured by the Jaccard distance; similar results were obtained using
term overlap (Mistry and Pavlidis, 2008). Annotation bias
(‘multifunctionality’ or ‘prevalence’) was measured as described in
(Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011a). Brieﬂy, the ranking of genes by the
number of GO terms was used as a ‘predictor’ of GO term
membership for all GO terms (with at least 10 genes), evaluated by
receiver operating characteristic curves. The mean area under the ROC
(AUROC) curve provides an overall measure of annotation bias.

2.2 Protein interaction network analysis

Human protein—protein interactions (PPIs) were obtained from the
HIPPIE database (Schaefer et al., 2012), which aggregates multiple
sources and contains 73 324 unique interactions across 8969 proteins
that possess annotations in GO. These interactions come from 24075
publications (as determined by PubMed id) reporting between 1 and
5119 interactions each (mean: 4.4) and with approximately half of the
publications (12030) reporting only a single interaction. A large propor-
tion of the interactions (57185) are based on a single report. Over the
same set of genes, in the latest edition of GO we assessed (103), GO
reports 77 723 assignments of function totaling 741270 assignments
after propagation to ancestors. We reported results only for those func-
tions with 10—300 genes, to emulate the use within many network analyses
(Pena-Castillo et al., 2008) and reduce the effects of overlaps in large or
small functions. Over this range, GO reports 14.4 functions per gene. The
confound of function annotations with PPIs was determined by compar-
ing the PubMed IDs for interactions linking pairs of genes within the
function to the PubMed ID associated with the assignment of those genes
to the function. We did not consider if multiple lines of evidence may
have otherwise supported linking those genes (or supplying that func-
tion), as which evidence to pick to avoid confound would still be an
unwanted bias. Prediction of gene function using interaction data used
a basic neighbor-voting algorithm in which genes are ranked based on the
fraction of their neighbors’ matching genes labeled as positive in the
training data, described in more detail in Gillis and Pavlidis (2011b).

2.3 Postsynaptic proteome

The postsynaptic proteome gene list was obtained from Collins et a].
(2006). Spectral clustering was performed as described by Ruan and
Zhang (2008). Only the 195 genes with greater than four subnetwork

connections were included in the clustering to remove many isolated
small components. Enrichment analysis was performed using Fisher’s
exact test with control of the false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini
and Hochberg, 1995).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Changes in gene functional identity over time

Although GO (and associated annotations) changes over time,
most users assume their results are not sensitive to this. Indeed, it
is rarely noted which version of GO was used in an analysis, and
even rarer to test a result for stability against different versions of
GO. To assess functional identity, we used semantic similarity
(Lord et al., 2003). We deﬁne functional identity as the degree to
which a gene is most semantically similar to itself in different
editions of GO (where by ‘GO’ we mean both the structure of
GO and the annotations). If annotations are stable, it will be
most semantically similar with itself, or at least tied for ﬁrst,
among all genes. If a gene’s annotations have changed dramat-
ically relative to other genes, it is in a sense a functionally differ-
ent gene.

Figure 1 plots the fraction of human genes having a consistent
functional identity (meaning having the highest semantic similar-
ity with itself) between every pair of editions of GOA. The aver-
age fraction of identity maintained in successive editions is 0.971.
A useful way to think of this is that if one uses GO annotations
as a basis for selecting a particular gene as ‘interesting’, one
cannot be more certain of this than 1—0.97 (i.e. a P—value of
0.03). That is, there is a chance that the next month, the gene’s
annotations will have changed so substantially that it is not func-
tionally ‘the same gene’. This estimate is conservative because of
ties in semantic similarity; therefore, the useful level of retained
identity is likely to be lower. Gene-level data on stability can be
used to evaluate results of GO-based analyses, as we illustrate
later in the use case (Section 3.4).

The preservation of functional identity is not uniform over
time; it is both slightly increasing (r=0.20, P<0.01) and
marked by sporadic large shifts (identity match falls as low as
0.82), which have been diminishing in magnitude and appear to
reﬂect changes in the ontology structure (and the resultant
change in propagated assignments), rather than new direct func-
tion assignments (Fig. 1). Of course, as shown in Figure 1, GO
changes even further over longer periods. The median duration
for which it retains a 95% gene identity match is ﬁve editions
(~5 months), whereas it takes a median of 25 editions for gene
identity to fall to 80%.

3.2 Changes in functional redundancy over time

Genes vary widely in how many GO annotations they have, and
this property is important to the use of GO. In Gillis and Pavlidis
(2011a), we treated the number of GO annotations as a measure
of gene multifunctionality, but it can also be thought of as the
prevalence of a gene in GO. It is unclear the degree to which
annotation bias reﬂects biology (‘actual’ multifunctionality)
versus popularity, in which some genes accrue more functions
simply because they are studied more. The interpretation of
differences in prevalence (‘annotation bias’) can be enhanced
by examining historical trends. A decrease in bias would mean

Fig. 1. Gene functional identity changes over GO editions. The shading
indicates the fraction of genes that retain a functional identity between
GO editions. Semantic similarity is calculated and genes are matched
between editions; if a gene is most similar to itself between editions, it
is said to retain its identity. Similarity is not symmetric in time
(GeneiGOA may rank GeneiGOB as most similar to it, without the re-
verse being true). Below the diagonal is matching backward in time;
above, forward in time

GO annotations are becoming more evenly distributed among
genes. At the gene level, a gene that dramatically changes its
degree of annotation would have a direct impact on GO-based
analyses that focus on the gene.

As in our previous work, we quantiﬁed overall annotation bias
using ROC curves [see Gillis and Pavlidis (2011a) and Section 2].
If all genes have the same number of GO terms, the annotation
bias is 0.5. At the other extreme, if there are only a few GO terms
used and they are all applied to the same set of genes, then the
bias is 1.0. Put another way, if one can perfectly predict which
GO terms genes have based on how many they have, the bias is
1.0. Thus, annotation bias measures the degree to which a state-
ment about a GO group of interest would apply equally well to
another randomly selected GO group, just because it will tend to
have some genes in common. In this sense, annotations can be
said to be redundant. Consistent with Gillis and Pavlidis (2011a),
in the last edition of human gene GO annotations we studied, the
bias was 0.84, many standard deviations away from 0.5. For
yeast, the current bias is less extreme, but still high (~0.7). To
be conservative, we calculated bias using only genes that have at
least one GO annotation; including all genes would increase
these values substantially.

The historical analysis (Fig. 2) reveals a steady increase in bias
over time for human genes until approximately GOA edition 70
where it leveled off (Fig. 2A). Interestingly, for yeast genes,
annotation bias was decreasing until approximately edition 60
where it leveled off (Fig. 2B).

These trends could be due to either accumulation of annota-
tions or changes in the structure of GO. To test this, we held GO
structure constant at the earliest edition studied and assessed the
change in bias as a consequence only of changes in annotation.
The yeast annotation bias retained the same pattern, but the
human annotation bias reversed direction, to more closely resem-
ble the pattern for yeast, decreasing over time (r: —0.5). This

Fig. 2. Annotation bias persists in the GO. (A) Annotation bias has risen
among human genes, indicating genes with many annotations have
become more dominant within GO over time. (B) Annotation bias has
generally fallen for yeast, aligned to remove two discontinuities that we
regarded as artifactual. (C) The relative number of annotations a gene
possesses has remained stable over time, with some change (correlation
shown). (D) Annotation bias (expressed as the number of GO terms for a
gene) is correlated with the rank of the numerical ID of the gene in NCBI,
indicating a historical bias

suggests much of the increase in annotation bias for human genes
is due to the proliferation of terms and/or relations in GO. This
proliferation is not primarily occurring at the ‘1eaf’ level, as indi-
cated by the fall in the fraction of leaf terms in the ontology from
50 to 39.5% (from editions 1 to 103, with leaf annotations simi-
larly falling from 5 to 3.2%) and a corresponding increase in the
number of ancestors per term of 85—130 over this interval. In
addition, the most heavily annotated genes have remained rela-
tively stable over GO editions, with the correlation between
genes ranked by prevalence in different versions of GO shown
in Figure 2C. The consistency of ‘popular genes’ over history is
also reﬂected in the degree to which numerical NCBI gene IDs
predicts the number of GO terms found for genes at present;
genes that were entered into NCBI ﬁrst tend to be more heavily
annotated (Fig. 2D). A related observation was recently made
for disease annotations (Cheung et al., 2012).

3.3 Independence of GO and protein interaction data

The tendency of proteins interacting in a network to share GO
categories (‘guilt by association’) serves to validate both the
networks and the GO as encoding ‘real’ function. Underlying
this is an assumption that the two forms of data are independent.
However, because both GO annotations and protein interactions
are derived from the published literature, there is a potential for
logical circularity that has, to our knowledge, never been
explored. We therefore compared the citations attached to
reported interactions and those attached to function assignments

Identity and confounds in the Gene Ontology

 

in GO, to look for overlapping sources of data that would be
considered potentially confounded. We use the term ‘con-
found’to indicate an overlap in data source that could affect
interpretation if independence was an important assumption.

We used a human PPI dataset from HIPPIE (Schaefer et al.,
2012), which documents 73 324 PPIs from 24075 published
articles (based on PubMed IDs). The GO annotations for the
genes covered by this set are drawn from 18 195 distinct publi-
cations. We found that 4313 of the PubMed IDs are common
between sources for the PPI and GO datasets, creating a strong
opportunity for overlap at the level of speciﬁc genes and their
interactions. One possibility is that ‘functional’ edges (those that
link genes sharing a GO term) are created by a single report.
That is, a single article might be used to assign GO terms and
protein interactions to the same gene. In these confounded cases,
artifactual similarities will easily appear.

We found that, as expected, interacting proteins shared GO
terms at a rate much higher than chance (mean 1.6, P< 10“”),
indicating substantial ‘guilt by association’. However, 13% of the
time, the GO annotation shared by the two genes was derived
from the same article that reported the protein interaction. At the
GO term level, 66% of GO groups with functional edges possess
confounds of this type (Fig. 3A), and on average, 18% of a given
gene set’s functionally relevant edges will consist of this type of
confound. One concern is the propagation of annotations to
ancestors in the GO graph could cause a misleading overestimate
in overlaps for annotations of higher-level terms. To exclude this
possibility, we permuted the PubMed IDs attached to GO IDs
and repeated the analysis and found all average confound scores
were <1%.

We hypothesized that the overlap between data sources for
GO annotations and PPIs would have an impact on the utility
of the PPIs for gene function prediction. We used a simple
machine-learning approach to test the predictability of GO
term annotations using the PPI network as the data source.
The algorithm is blinded to a fraction of GO annotations and
attempts to reconstruct them from the other labels and the rela-
tionships encoded by the interaction data, based on guilt by
association (e. g. genes interacting with genes of a particular func-
tion are predicted to have that function themselves). Again, in
agreement with the guilt by association principle, GO terms are
signiﬁcantly learnable on average, with a mean AUROC of 0.67.

Fig. 3. Data are reused in protein-interaction networks and GO. (A)
Many GO groups have a large fraction of their network functional con-
nectivity coming from the same publication as the GO annotations (‘con-
founded’). (B): Most network connections can be used to infer some
function due to confounds

However, this performance was signiﬁcantly correlated (r=0.2,
Spearman correlation, P< 10‘24) with the number of ‘confound’
edges the functions contained, indicating logical circularity may
play a major role in the network interpretation of function.
Indeed, a network built from only confounded edges yielded a
mean AUROC of 0.58 (much higher than expected by chance),
suggesting the use of GO to interpret network structure is
affected by a form of circular logic. One possibility we considered
is that those edges most likely to be confounded were also most
likely to be important in determining function. We used our
previously described analysis of network edges in which they
are ranked by their contribution to function prediction (mea-
sured as the impact removing that edge has on aggregate
performance) (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2012). ‘Exceptional edges’
are those that contribute substantially to the learnability of
many gene functions. We found there is a v-shaped relationship
(Fig. 4) between exceptionality and confound such that both
exceptional and unexceptional (but still linking functionally
related genes) are both highly confounded on average.

Finally, we conducted a historical analysis of these potential
sources of confounds (starting with edition 61, where annotation
bias leveled off), shown in Figure 5. We ﬁnd that both
function-centered and connection-centered measures of con-
found have been relatively stable in GO over this time. As
expected, those annotations labeled as ‘inferred from protein
interaction’ (evidence code IPI) were substantially more likely
to be confounded. Even though IPI annotation may not expli-
citly be transferring functional assignment (instead, e.g., it may
indicate regulatory interactions implying different functional
assignment), at slightly higher levels in the ontology, the assign-
ment will be equivalent to being transferred across the inter-
action. Subsequent use of the interaction data in conjunction
with these higher-level terms would then be confounded.
Removing IPI annotations did not substantially alter the average
overall confound (Fig. 5B and D); therefore, this is not a sufﬁ-
cient solution.

Fig. 4. Confounded edges are likely to either have very low or very high
impacts on determining function within networks. ‘Confound’ is calcu-
lated as the fraction of shared functional assignments for a protein pair,
which overlap (in either part) with the article reporting the protein inter-
action. Exceptionality was calculated as the effect of a given edge’s re-
moval on network function prediction performance in cross-validation
(Gillis and Pavlidis, 2012). The data are binned (bins of 100 edges per
point, non-overlapping) to emphasize the trend

3.4 Use case: the postsynaptic proteome

Thus far, we have considered phenomena at a high level while
arguing that the gene-level details can be exploited to assist in
more typical applications of GO. As an illustration, we describe
an extended sample use case.

One common use of GO is the analysis of network ‘modules’
enriched for particular functions as well as candidate genes, for
example in O’Roak et al. (2012) and Rossin et al. (2011). We take
as our gene list of interest the ‘consensus post-synaptic proteome’
(PSP) characterized in a meta-analysis of proteomics data
(Collins et al., 2006). This set is an interesting target because of
the role of synapses (the points of chemical communication
between neurons) in biological processes such as learning and
memory, and diseases such as autism and schizophrenia. We
note that the PSP gene set was chosen not through an exhaustive
search for gene sets that have ‘problems’, but owing to our
laboratories’ research interests. Our analysis follows a workﬂow
that one sees commonly in the literature when researchers are
confronted with a new set of genes to interpret (albeit with
numerous methodological variations).

When enrichment analysis is run on this list, 67 diverse func-
tions are signiﬁcantly enriched (FDR<0.01). We then hypothe-
sized that the genes will preferentially show protein interactions
(‘guilt by association’). Indeed, considered as a target for func-
tion prediction, membership in the PSP is predictable from the
full network using a simple machine-learning algorithm on the
protein interaction data discussed in Section 3, with an AUROC
of 0.73 in cross-validation. We then used the same protein inter-
action to construct a PSP subnetwork. As the network was still
fairly large, we attempted to ﬁnd sub-components, using spectral

CDH2 (diamonds) received annotations from articles reporting both their
functional annotation and their interaction (PubMed IDs 1639850 and
7650039)

partitioning (Ruan and Zhang, 2008). This yielded six subnet-
works (modules) varying in size from 11 to 67 genes. The parti-
tioning had modularity function Q of 0.40, indicating high
community structure (\Nhite and Smyth, 2005). Considered
separately, four of the modules had signiﬁcantly enriched GO
groups (FDR P<0.01), suggesting the modules partly reﬂect
different functions. There were multiple GO groups associated
with each modules, with clear themes: glutamatergic activity and
synaptic transmission (cluster 1), cell junctions and adhesion
(cluster 3), ribosomal components (cluster 4) and endocytosis
(cluster 6) (see Supplementary Table S1).

We now move to considering the impacts of the effects
described in the previous sections. We ﬁrst tested whether the
enrichment was sensitive to GO edition. We measured this by
determining the number of editions over which a gene’s most
semantic similar match at a previous time point was itself, as
discussed in Section 3.1. All clusters except for cluster 3 had a
self-similarity match of >30 GO editions (~2.5 years), whereas
cluster 3 exhibited only moderate consistency (genes mapped to
selves by self-similarity for 21.6 editions). Only cluster 3 (shown
in Fig. 6) contained genes signiﬁcantly different in the semantic
similarity consistency from other clusters (P<0.05, rank sum
test). This suggests cluster 3’s results may not be robust.

Another possibility is that separation of functions by PPI clus-
tering does not indicate an orthogonal property, but simply that
different articles reported both certain interaction and certain
functions, as analysed in Section 3.3. We found that two inter-
acting proteins in cluster 3 were confounded in this way, owing
to annotation from two articles (diamonds in Fig. 6). Removing
those GO terms from the two genes reduces the functional en-
richment for the module to the point that no functions meet the
FDR 0.01 threshold.

Another notable feature of module 3 is the hub-like status of
FYN (encoding the Fyn tyrosine kinase protooncogene). FYN is
not among the genes driving GO term enrichment within this
module, but it clearly possesses an unusually dense connectivity.

Identity and confounds in the Gene Ontology

 

Although FYN has many interactions in the full network, it is
signiﬁcantly attached to this module in particular (P<10_14).
Checking the multifunctionality of FYN (as in Section 3.2), we
ﬁnd it is in the top 12% of annotated genes, suggesting any
attempt to interpret FYN’s hub-like status, as characteristic of
the module will potentially fall prey to confabulation. That is, if
FYN is heavily studied enough, we will be able to ﬁnd literature
support for many interesting hypotheses about this module if we
assume FYN characterizes it. However, a top 12% score is not
so high that such analyses are impossible but merely require
some greater degree of care.

We propose that the interpretation of many ‘interesting gene
sets’ will be enhanced by the considerations just described. To
assist others in conducting similar analyses, we have made a
number of resources available as supplementary data at
http://chibi.ubc.ca/assessGO:

(l) A list of GO functions and the PubMed IDs of articles
contributing the most (typically, all) confound edges for
each of those functions. Thus, if a module of candidate
genes is found to be enriched for a particular function, the
articles underlying that overlap can be easily checked
against our list.

(2) A list of genes and the number of GO editions since they
changed functional identity (measured as not having the
highest semantic similarity with itself). Thus, for example,
we can see that the gene most tenuously connected to our
module (Fig. 6), NSF, has changed functional identity
within the last three editions of GO.

(3) A table of the similarity ranking for each gene back
through each edition of GO. For each edition of G0,
the semantic similarity of each gene is calculated for a
given gene. The score the given gene receives is the rank
of similarity it has with itself, relative to other genes. Thus,
most genes take a score of 1 when compared with the
previous edition of GO (they are most similar to them-
selves). These numbers allow us to assess whether results
based on old data are likely to hold true. If, for example, a
gene is prioritized for investigation through some
GO-based analysis at some time in the past, this table
indicates whether the same gene would be obtained
today (or whether results need to be updated).

(4) A list of gene multifunctionality rankings over time. This
may be of use to developers in attempting to reduce the
annotation bias in GO. For example, one of the least
stable human genes is PDE2A, which gained >200 GO
terms during the past 2-month period measured an
increase of >300%.

We intend to expand these resources to include data for more
organisms and to maintain updated versions as a resource for the
community.

4 DISCUSSION

Our contribution in this report is the identiﬁcation and analysis
of three types of quantiﬁable issues with the GO that we argue
are essential to its usefulness. Importantly, these issues are

distinct from the question of the ‘correctness’ of the annotations.
Although the issues we have uncovered certainly do not cripple
GO’s utility, they are severe enough to run a strong risk of
misleading the ﬁeld if not adequately taken into account. Here,
we discuss some implications of each of our ﬁndings.

We presented a way to quantify the stability of GO annota-
tions over time and showed that over moderate time spans many
genes become different in their annotated functionality. The
statement ‘the differentially expressed genes were enriched for
genes with functions in cell growth’ does not necessarily mean
the same thing today as it did 5 years ago because the deﬁnition
of ‘cell growth genes’ has changed in GO. Valid experimental
results often become obsolete over time, but the reported facts of
the experiment should not. But that is what happens when the
GO changes. This is of course to be expected, and the problem
can be ameliorated by reporting which version of the gene an-
notations was used. But we can do better, thanks to the formal
structure of GO: it is possible to quantitatively evaluate how
volatile a result is likely to be. That is, users of GO could con-
sider the likely future stability of their results, as well as the
current relevance of past results. We suggest that in the future
the GO consortium might track stability and report the duration
since each gene’s last major shift in its functional identity. Any
review of the literature thereafter could check that the ‘best
before’ date for those results had not passed. A similar conclu-
sion was reached by Gross et al. (2012) in their consideration of
the time dependence of GO enrichment results.

We further found that annotation bias is a long-standing
feature of GO and has no signs of declining. This bias has
broad effects on the interpretation of analyses (Gillis and
Pavlidis, 2011a; Greene and Troyanskaya, 2012). In general,
this fact enjoins researchers to be cautious in the interpretation
and use of GO: the biases in GO annotation are of sufﬁcient
magnitude to swamp almost any true result about gene function.
This problem with GO can be regarded as a particular variant of
‘publication bias’, in which GO makes it even easier than usual
to select genes for study, only because they have already been
heavily studied. However, this does not mean GO is useless
because those biases are sometimes easy to assess. Rather than
simply discarding enrichment or network results using GO, they
should instead be explicitly assessed for their speciﬁcity. Results
where divergent lines of evidence (one involving GO) both point
to a highly studied gene are much less interesting than ones
where divergent lines of evidence point to genes with more cir-
cumscribed-documented function. Our results further suggest
that the increase of this bias for human genes (between 2001
and 2009) seems to be owing to the proliferation of GO terms
and relations (as opposed to biased annotation). Thus, it appears
to be more of an effect of data organization and representation
than biological reality or new discoveries about gene function.
We suggest the GO developers consider the impact on interpret-
ability of additions to GO.

Our third set of ﬁndings concerned the confound between GO
and other data. We consider ensuring independence of GO from
the datasets to which it is being applied as an absolute minimum
standard, and our results show that at least some protein inter-
action data do not meet this standard. Because this does not
affect all proteins and functions, we suggest that particular
results be checked for confounds as in our case study. For

example, a gene that was prioritized on the basis of its having a
particular subset of functions should be carefully checked against
any other sources of data used.

We also observed an interesting v-shaped relationship between
the tendency for genes to have GO annotations from the same
citation as PPIs and ‘exceptionality’ of edges associated with the
gene (Fig. 4). Because low exceptionality is associated with a high
number of GO annotations (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2012), our ten-
tative interpretation is that highly annotated genes will tend to
accumulate at least one confounded annotation (low exception-
ality and high confound). We further speculate that less-studied
genes are more likely to possess functions, which are themselves
little studied (and thus knowledge of that gene is critical), and yet
because these functions and genes are little studied, they too are
likely to draw on overlapping citations (high exceptionality, high
confound). The happy medium occurs when divergent lines of
evidence point speciﬁcally to both interactions and functions.

In our experience, among systems biologists there seems to be
a broadly appreciated disjunction between the true utility of GO
and how often it is used, even if this is rarely acknowledged in the
peer-reviewed literature. The use of GO annotations is often
regarded as a minimally interesting validation of results, but
not safe to use for discovery purposes. We believe the problems
we have identiﬁed are among the underlying sources of these
mixed feelings about GO. If it is too easy to obtain interesting
results using GO, and those results do not consistently hold up,
then GO’s use for such purposes is limited. We hope that our
concrete suggestions to recognize and possibly correct these
issues will help in the development of best practices and help
ensure that GO remains useful and relevant to systems biologists.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: As high-throughput transcriptome sequencing provides
evidence for novel transcripts in many species, there is a
renewed need for accurate methods to classify small genomic
regions as protein coding or non-coding. We present PhyloCSF, a
novel comparative genomics method that analyzes a multispecies
nucleotide sequence alignment to determine whether it is likely to
represent a conserved protein-coding region, based on a formal
statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models.

Results: We show that PhyloCSF’s classification performance
in 12-species Drosophila genome alignments exceeds all other
methods we compared in a previous study. We anticipate that
this method will be widely applicable as the transcriptomes of
many additional species, tissues and subcellular compartments are
sequenced, particularly in the context of ENCODE and modENCODE,
and as interest grows in long non-coding RNAs, often initially
recognized by their lack of protein coding potential rather than
conserved RNA secondary structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

High—throughput transcriptome sequencing (mRNA—Seq) is yielding
precise structures for novel transcripts in many species, including
mammals (Guttman et al., 2010). Accurate computational methods
are needed to classify these transcripts and the corresponding
genomic exons as protein coding or non—coding, even if the transcript
models are incomplete or if they only reveal novel exons of already—
known genes. In addition to classifying novel transcript models,
such methods also have applications in evaluating and revising
existing gene annotations (Butler et al., 2009; Clamp et al., 2007;
Kellis et al., 2003; Lin et al., 2007; Pruitt et al., 2009), and
as input features for de novo gene structure predictors (Alioto
and Guigo, 2009; Brent, 2008). We have previously (Lin et al.,
2008) compared numerous methods for determining whether an
exon—length nucleotide sequence is likely to be protein coding
or non—coding, including single—sequence metrics that analyze the
genome of interest only and comparative genomics metrics that use
alignments of orthologous regions in the genomes of related species.

Among the comparative methods benchmarked in our previous
study, one of our original contributions was the Codon Substitution
Frequencies (CSF) metric, which assigns a score to each codon
substitution observed in the input alignment based on the relative

frequency of that substitution in known coding and non—coding
regions. We showed that CSF is highly effective, performing
competitively with a phylogenetic modeling approach with much
less computational expense, and indeed we have applied it
successfully in ﬂies (Lin et al., 2007; Stark et al., 2007), fungi
(Butler et al., 2009) and mammals (Clamp et al., 2007; Guttman
et al., 2009, 2010). However, as discussed in our previous work, CSF
has certain drawbacks arising from its ad hoc scheme for combining
evidence from multiple species. For example, it makes only partial
use of the evidence available in a multispecies alignment, and
it produces a score lacking a precise theoretical interpretation,
meaningful only relative to its empirical distributions in known
coding and non—coding regions.

This article introduces a rigorous reformulation of CSF, which
frames the evaluation of a given alignment as a statistical
model comparison problem, choosing between phylogenetic models
estimated from known coding and non—coding regions as the
best explanation for the alignment. This new ‘PhyloCSF’ method
fully leverages multiple alignments in a phylogenetic framework,
produces meaningful likelihood ratios as its output and rests upon the
sweeping theoretical foundation for statistical model comparison.
Benchmarking on the classiﬁcation datasets from our original study,
we show that PhyloCSF outperforms all the other methods we had
previously considered.

PhyloCSF is applicable for assessing the coding potential of
transcript models or individual exons in an assembled genome that
can be aligned to one or more informant genomes at appropriate
phylogenetic distances. To estimate parameters in the underlying
statistical models, the approach also requires that the genome of
interest, or one of the informant genomes, have existing coding
gene annotations of reasonably good quality. We describe several
initial applications of the method in such settings, which illustrate
how it can contribute to new genome annotation strategies based on
mRNA—Seq.

2 APPROACH

PhyloCSF is based on the well—established theoretical framework
for statistical phylogenetic model comparison. In this context,
phylogenetic models are generative probabilistic models that
produce alignments of molecular sequences, based on a prior
distribution over a common ancestral sequence, the topology and
branch lengths of a phylogenetic tree relating the descendants, and
a substitution process along each branch giving the rates (per unit
branch length) at which each character changes to any other. In
phylogenetic model comparison, we wish to choose between two
competing models as the better explanation for a given alignment.
A standard approach is to decide based on the likelihood ratio

between the two models, which quantiﬁes how much more probable
the alignment is under one model than under the other. This
general approach has been used to explore many different aspects
of the evolution of protein—coding genes, as recently reviewed in
Anisimova and Kosiol (2008) and Delport et al. (2008).

To distinguish coding and non—coding regions, we design one
phylogenetic model to represent the evolution of codons in protein—
coding genes, and another to represent the evolution of nucleotide
triplet sites in non—coding regions. These models may have one or
more parameters 6 that adjust them to the genomic region of interest,
e.g. the neutral substitution rate or G + C content. To analyze a given
alignment A of extant sequences, we ﬁrst determine the probability
of the alignment under the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE) of
the parameters for the coding model, pC =maxeC Pr(A| Coding, 6C).
We similarly estimate the alignment’s probability under the non—
coding model, my 2 maxeN Pr(A| Noncoding, 6N). Finally, we decide
if the alignment is more likely to represent a protein—coding region
or a non—coding region based on the log—likelihood ratio A = log 10—13.
The cutoff can be chosen to achieve a certain level of statistical
signiﬁcance, based on known asymptotic convergence properties
of the log—likelihood ratio statistic (Ota et al., 2000; Vuong, 1989;
Whelan and Goldman, 1999), or it can be chosen empirically based
on classiﬁcation performance in a test set; we use the latter strategy
in this work.

2.1 The dN/ds test

A standard method for detecting purifying selection on protein—
coding sequences is to test for evidence that non—synonymous
substitutions occur at a slower rate than synonymous substitutions.
In the widely used PAML implementation of this test (Yang,
2007; Yang and Nielsen, 1998), the vector of codon frequencies
71' and the ratio of transition to transversion rates K are the only
parameters used to determine all triplet substitution rates in the
background/non—coding model, while the coding model additionally
supposes that non—synonymous codon substitution rates are reduced
relative to synonymous rates by a scale factor a) (also called dN / d S).
PAML takes the phylogenetic tree topology as input, and estimates
the branch lengths, 71', K and a) for each alignment. The log—
likelihood ratio between the coding and non—coding models can
then be obtained from PAML’s output. (For detecting purifying
selection, the log—likelihood ratio is set to zero if the estimated
a) Z 1.)

Our previous work (Lin et al., 2008) showed this to be one
of the best comparative methods for distinguishing coding and
non—coding regions, outperforming our CSF metric according to
standard classiﬁcation error measures. Notably however, the d N / d 5
test performed worse than CSF for short regions (5 180 nt). This is
not surprising since PAML was designed for evolutionary analysis
of complete open—reading frames (ORFs), not short exon—length
regions, which probably provide too little information to reliably
estimate both the branch lengths and codon frequencies in addition
to the two rate parameters.

2.2 PhyloCSF

PhyloCSF differs from the standard dN/dS test in two main ways.
First, it takes advantage of recent advances in phylogenetic codon
models that enable much more detailed representations of coding and
non—coding sequence evolution. Speciﬁcally, while the dN/dS test

uses only a few parameters to model the rates of all possible codon
substitutions (Yang and Nielsen, 1998), PhyloCSF uses empirical
codon models (ECMs) based on several thousand parameters
modeling these rates (Kosiol et al., 2007)—one ECM estimated
from alignments of many known coding regions and another ECM
from non—coding regions. By comparing these two rich evolutionary
models, PhyloCSF can observe many additional informative features
of a given alignment compared with the dN/ d 5 test. For example,
the coding ECM captures not only the decreased overall rate of non—
synonymous substitutions, but also the different rates of speciﬁc non—
synonymous substitutions reﬂecting the chemical properties of the
amino acids. [Earlier codon modeling approaches also incorporate
amino acid distances, e.g. Goldman and Yang (1994), but to our
knowledge, these are not widely used for distinguishing coding and
non—coding regions] Also, our ECMs explicitly model the extreme
difference in the rates of nonsense substitutions (giving rise to stop
codons) in coding and non—coding regions.

Second, PhyloCSF also takes advantage of genome—wide training
data to provide prior information about the branch lengths in
the phylogenetic tree and the codon frequencies, rather than
attempting to reestimate these a priori in each individual alignment.
PhyloCSF assumes a ﬁxed tree ‘shape’ based on the genome—
wide MLEs of the branch lengths, and estimates only two scale
factors pc and ,oN, applied uniformly to all the branch lengths
in the coding and non—coding models, respectively, for each
individual region analyzed. This allows PhyloCSF to accomodate
some region—speciﬁc rate variation and reduces its sensitivity to
the absolute degree of conservation—without needing to estimate
many parameters for each alignment, which may be difﬁcult for
short regions.

In summary (Fig. 1), PhyloCSF relies on two ECMs ﬁt to genome—
wide training data, which include estimates for the branch lengths,
codon frequencies and codon substitution rates for known coding
and non—coding regions. To evaluate a given nucleotide sequence
alignment, PhyloCSF (i) determines the MLE of the scale factor
,0 on the branch lengths for each of these models, (ii) computes
the likelihood of each model (the probability of the alignment
under the model) using the MLE of the scale factor, and (iii)
reports the log—likelihood ratio between the coding and non—coding
models.

3 METHODS
3.1 PhyloCSF

PhyloCSF’s trained parameters include a phylogenetic tree (with branch
lengths) and two 64 x 64 codon rate matrices QC and QN representing
coding and non—coding sequence evolution, respectively, as reversible,
homogeneous, continuous—time Markov processes. To evaluate a given
alignment, we ﬁrst evaluate the likelihood of the coding model as follows.
We deﬁne an alignment—speciﬁc parameter ,oC that operates as a scale factor
applied to all of the branch lengths in the predeﬁned tree. Given a setting
of pc, the substitution probability matrix along any branch with length t is
given by P=exp(t,oCQc). We can then compute the probability of the full
alignment using Felsenstein (2004)’s algorithm—assuming independence of
the codon sites, using the equilibrium frequencies implicit in QC as the prior
distribution over the common ancestral sequence, and marginalizing out any
gapped or ambiguous codons. We numerically maximize this probability
over pc to obtain the likelihood of the coding model 190. We then evaluate
the likelihood of the non—coding model my in the same way, using QN and an

Fig. 1. PhyloCSF method overview. (A) PhyloCSF uses phylogenetic codon models estimated from genome—wide training data based on known coding and
non—coding regions. These models include a phylogenetic tree and codon substitution rate matrices QC and QN for coding and non—coding regions, respectively,
shown here for 12 Drosophila species. QC captures the characteristic evolutionary signatures of codon substitutions in conserved coding regions, while QN
captures the typical evolutionary rates of triplet sites in non—coding regions. (B) PhyloCSF applied to a short region from the ﬁrst exon of the D.melanogaster
homeobox gene Dfd. The alignment of this region shows only synonymous substitutions compared with the inferred ancestral sequence (green). Using the
maximum likelihood estimate of a scale factor ,0 applied to the assumed branch lengths, the alignment has higher probability under the coding model than the
non—coding model, resulting in a positive log—likelihood ratio A. (C) PhyloCSF applied to a conserved region within a Dfd intron. In contrast to the exonic
alignment, this region shows many non—synonymous substitutions (red), nonsense substitutions (blue, purple) and frameshifts (orange). The alignment has
lower probability under the coding model, resulting in a negative score.

3.2 Estimation of empirical codon models

To estimate the phylogenetic tree and the empirical rate matrices QC and QN
for the species of interest, we rely on sequence alignments of many known
coding and random non—coding regions. Given this genome—wide training
data, we estimate the parameters for the coding and non—coding models
by maximum likelihood, using an expectation—maximization approach.
The E—step is carried out as previously described (Holmes and Rubin,
2002; Siepel and Haussler, 2004). In each M—step, we update the ECM
exchangeability parameters using a spectral approximation method (Arvestad
and Bruno, 1997) and the branch lengths by numerical optimization of the
expected log—likelihood function (Siepel and Haussler, 2004). Meanwhile,
the codon/triplet frequencies are ﬁxed to their empirical averages in the
training examples, and we assume a ﬁxed species tree topology.

3.3 Parameter estimation for \I/ transformation

Below, we introduce a length—based transformation of the PhyloCSF log—
likelihood ratio score A for an alignment,

N(Alnuc, (AanC)2)

N(AlnMN,(ANnBN)2)

 

where n is the length of the aligned region in the reference species,
N(x|a,02) is the normal density and the six parameters ac, AC, BC, MN,
AN and BN must be estimated from the training dataset. We estimate these
parameters by maximum likelihood, i.e. for the known coding regions in the
training dataset (indexed by i), we seek

argmax ZlogN (Ailniac, (Acnfc)2>
MCsACsBC 

Setting the gradient of this log—likelihood function to zero yields a system of

three equations,

where the Z—score Zi=(Ai—nia)/(Acnfc). We solve this system using
Newton’s method to obtain MLEs of ac, AC and BC. We estimate the
corresponding parameters for non—coding regions MN, AN and BN similarly,
using the non—coding examples in the training dataset instead of the coding
examples.

4 RESULTS
4.1 PhyloCSF outperforms other methods

We used the datasets and benchmarks from our previous study
(Lin et al., 2008) to evaluate our new method. Brieﬂy, the datasets
consist of known protein—coding regions and randomly selected non—
coding regions (~50 000 total regions) in the genome of the fruitﬂy
Drosophila melanogaster, aligned with 11 other Drosophila species
using MULTIZ (Blanchette et al., 2004; Drosophila l2 Genomes
Consortium, 2007; Stark et al., 2007). The lengths of the regions in
both the coding and non—coding sets match the length distribution
of ﬂy coding exons. Consistent with our previous work, we trained
and applied PhyloCSF on this dataset using 4—fold cross—validation
to ensure that any observed performance differences are not due to

overﬁtting. We assessed the results by examining ROC curves and
computing the minimum average error (MAE), the average false
positive and false negative rates at the cutoff that minimizes this
average. To compare the power of the methods for short exons
speciﬁcally, we additionally computed these benchmarks only for
the 37% of examples from 30 to 180 nt in length (a range including
three—quarters of mammalian coding exons).

These benchmarks show that PhyloCSF outperforms the
other comparative methods we previously benchmarked
(Fig. 2, left column), effectively dominating them all at good
sensitivity/speciﬁcity tradeoffs. PhyloCSF’s overall MAE is 19%
lower than that of the Reading Frame Conservation metric, 15%
lower than that of our older CSF method and 8% lower than the
dN / d S test’s. PhyloCSF also clearly outperforms the other methods
for short exons (Fig. 2, bottom row), with an MAE 11% lower than
the dN/dS test’s. Our previous study (Lin et al., 2008) showed
that these comparative methods in turn outperform single—species
metrics based on sequence composition [e. g. interpolated Markov
models (Delcher et al., 1999) and the Z curve discriminant (Gao
and Zhang, 2004)].

We also compared PhyloCSF to the other methods using only
pairwise alignments between D.melanogaster and Dananassae,
which we previously showed to be the best single informant for this
purpose. PhyloCSF also dominates other methods in these pairwise
alignments (Fig. 2, right column), with MAE 24% lower than the
next—best method’s for all aligned regions (dN/dS test) and 21%
lower for the short regions (CSF). Some of PhyloCSF’s greater
relative advantage in the pairwise case arises from its ability to
produce an informative score even for regions lacking alignment
with Dananassae, based on the composition of the D.melanogaster
region and the codon frequencies included in PhyloCSF’s generative
ECMs.

Overall, these benchmarks show that PhyloCSF provides superior
power to distinguish ﬂy coding and non—coding regions based on
either multispecies or pairwise genome alignments.

4.2 Using non-independence of codon sites to increase
accuracy

Like most codon modeling approaches, PhyloCSF assumes
statistical independence of each codon site from all the others in the
alignment (conditional on the model parameters). We next studied
the extent to which this assumption is violated in the real alignments
in our dataset, and sought to use this to further improve our ability
to distinguish the coding and non—coding regions.

One simple way of assessing the dependence of codon sites in a set
of alignments is to measure the relationship between the PhyloCSF
log—likelihood ratio, A, and the number of sites in each alignment,
n. For alignments consisting of n truly i.i.d. sites generated from
either the coding or non—coding ECM, it can be shown by central
limit arguments that the SD(A)o<ﬁ (Cox, 1961, 1962; Vuong,
1989; White, 1982). On the other hand, SD(A) ocn under complete
dependence of the sites in each alignment—that is, where each
alignment consists of a single randomly sampled site, repeated
n times. We applied a numerical procedure to ﬁnd MLEs of
coefﬁcients A and B in SD(A) ~AnB based on the real alignments
in our dataset. For coding regions, we found BC 2084 and for non—
coding regions, we found BN 20.76. Compared with the expected
values of 3:05 under complete independence and 3:1 under

and non—coding regions suggest that a better classiﬁcation rule
could be obtained by interpreting the log—likelihood ratio for each
example in the context of the alignment’s length. This contrasts
with the suggestion of the ‘law of likelihood’ that, under the
model’s independence assumptions, any information pertinent to the
decision would already be captured in the likelihood ratio (Hacking,
1974).

We deﬁned a new log—likelihood ratio score ‘11 for each alignment
by assuming that A normally distributes with mean and variance as
differing functions of n for coding and non—coding regions:

N(AIWC,(ACI’IBC)2>
N(Aln.U«N, (ANnBN)2)

 

\II(A,n) =log

where N(x| ,a, 02) is the normal density and the six parameters ,aC,
AC, BC, ,0. N, AN and EN are estimated from the training dataset by
maximum likelihood (see Section 3).

We calculated ‘11 for each of the examples in our Drosophila
dataset (with 2—fold cross—validation) and found that it indeed
provides a superior overall discriminant between the coding and
non—coding regions (Fig. 3), with an MAE 17% lower than that
of A and 24% lower than the dN/dS test’s. While ‘11 somewhat
distorts the formal inferential meaning captured by A, this approach
exploits information from site—to—site dependencies in a principled
way, and at negligible additional computational cost—in contrast to
attempts to explicitly capture such dependencies in the generative
codon models (Anisimova and Kosiol, 2008; Delport et al., 2008).

5 IMPLEMENTATION

To facilitate the use of PhyloCSF by the community, we provide an
implementation that evaluates input sequence alignments in Multi—
FASTA format and reports the resulting log—likelihood ratios in units
of decibans. We also provide the ECMs and other parameter settings
for several phylogenies.

The software provides two additional noteworthy features. First,
it can evaluate all ORFs above a given length, in three or six reading
frames, within each alignment. Thus, it can delimit likely protein—
coding ORFs within transcript models that include untranslated
regions. Second, the software also provides a simpliﬁed method,
similar to the aforementioned dN /dS test, that does not require
extensive training data from known coding and non—coding regions.
While considerably less accurate than the full ECM comparison
presented here, this method can be used in settings where genome
alignments are available but high—quality existing gene annotations
are lacking, as may increasingly be the case outside of well—studied
phylogenies such as mammals and ﬂies.

and Mac OS X are available at: http://compbio.mit.edu/PhyloCSF

6 APPLICATIONS IN FUNGI, FLIES AND
MAMMALS

We now brieﬂy discuss several initial applications of PhyloCSF in
three different phylogenies. While biological results of each of these
applications are presented elsewhere in greater detail, together they
illustrate PhyloCSF’s usefulness in practice.

Recent efforts to reconstruct the transcriptome of the ﬁssion yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe based on mRNA—Seq experiments
suggested numerous novel transcript models. We generated whole—
genome alignments of S.pombe with S.octosporus, S. japonicas and
S.cryophilus, and identiﬁed 89 novel protein—coding genes that are
highly conserved among these species, even though they do not show
primary sequence similarity to known proteins. The mRNA—Seq
reconstruction also suggested several hundred revisions to the exon—
intron structures of existing gene annotations. PhyloCSF showed
that the revised transcript models strongly tend to have higher coding
potential than the originals, conﬁrming the quality of the proposed
revisions (Rhind et al., in press).

The modENCODE project undertook a comprehensive effort to
map the transcriptome of D.melanogaster, identifying 1938 novel
transcribed loci in this well—studied genome. Using PhyloCSF with
the l2—species whole—genome alignments, we identiﬁed 138 of
these likely to represent novel coding genes (The modENCODE
Consortium, 2010). We also used PhyloCSF in concert with
the modENCODE data to identify and characterize 283 known
D. melanogaster genes that show high coding potential immediately
downstream of their stop codon, suggesting a surprisingly
widespread mechanism of stop codon readthrough (J ungreis,J . et al.,
submitted for publication). PhyloCSF’s ability to systematically
resolve small regions was especially important in this application,
as many of these putative readthrough regions are quite short (mean
67 codons).

Lastly, we have also used PhyloCSF in the human and mouse
genomes, using alignments of 29 placental mammals (Linblad—
Toh,K. et al., submitted for publication). We applied PhyloCSF
to transcript models reconstructed from mRNA—Seq on 16 human

Fig. 4. A novel human coding gene found using mRNA—Seq and PhyloCSF. Transcriptome reconstruction by Scripture (Guttman et al., 2010) based on brain
mRNA—Seq data provided by Illumina, Inc. produced two alternative transcript models lying antisense to an intron of GT F 2E2, a known protein—coding gene.
PhyloCSF identiﬁed a 95—codon ORF in the third exon of this transcript, highly conserved across placental mammals. The color schematic illustrates the
genome alignment of 29 placental mammals for this ORF, indicating conservation (white), synonymous and conservative codon substitutions (green), other
non—synonymous codon substitutions (red), stop codons (blue/magenta/yellow) and frame—shifted regions (orange). Despite its unmistakable protein—coding
evolutionary signatures, the ORF’s translation shows no sequence similarity to known proteins.

tissues to identify several candidate novel coding genes (Fig. 4),
despite the extensive decade—long efforts to annotate the human
genome. We also used CSF and PhyloCSF to evaluate coding
potential in novel mouse transcripts, helping to identify thousands
of long non-coding RNAs with diverse functional roles (Guttman
et al., 2010) (Hung et al., in press).

7 CONCLUSION

We have introduced PhyloCSF, a comparative genomics method for
distinguishing protein—coding and non—coding regions, and shown
that it outperforms previous methods. In addition to its superior
discriminatory power, PhyloCSF is far more theoretically attractive
than our older CSF and other ad hoc metrics, relying on a formal
statistical comparison of phylogenetic codon models. However,
we note that PhyloCSF and CSF produce highly correlated scores
(Pearson coefﬁcient 0.95 in our dataset), and the new method is
much more computationally demanding.

As our initial applications illustrate, PhyloCSF can provide an
important building block in future computational strategies for
genome annotation based on mRNA—Seq. Other pieces of the puzzle
include methods to reconstruct transcript models based on short
reads, complementary metrics of coding potential based on primary
sequence composition or indel patterns, database search tools to
identify similarity to known proteins and non—coding RNAs and
de novo gene structure predictors that may be able to identify lowly
or rarely expressed genes. Major challenges remain in integrating
these methods into coherent pipelines, harmonizing the results with
existing genome annotation databases, and coping with the uneven

coverage and relatively high error rate of current high—throughput
sequencing technologies (Ozsolak and Milos, 2011).

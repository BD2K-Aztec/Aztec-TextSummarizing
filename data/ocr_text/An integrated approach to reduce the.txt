ABSTRACT

Motivation: There is growing momentum to develop statistical learn-
ing (SL) methods as an alternative to conventional genome-wide as-
sociation studies (GWAS). Methods such as random forests (RF) and
gradient boosting machine (GBM) result in variable importance meas-
ures that indicate how well each single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNP) predicts the phenotype. For RF, it has been shown that variable
importance measures are systematically affected by minor allele
frequency (MAF) and linkage disequilibrium (LD). To establish RF
and GBM as viable alternatives for analyzing genome-wide data, it is
necessary to address this potential bias and show that SL methods do
not significantly under-perform conventional GWAS methods.
Results: Both LD and MAF have a significant impact on the variable
importance measures commonly used in RF and GBM. Dividing SNPs
into overlapping subsets with approximate linkage equilibrium and
applying SL methods to each subset successfully reduces the
impact of LD. A welcome side effect of this approach is a dramatic
reduction in parallel computing time, increasing the feasibility of apply-
ing SL methods to large datasets. The created subsets also facilitate a
potential correction for the effect of MAF using pseudocovariates.
Simulations using simulated SNPs embedded in empirical data—
assessing varying effect sizes, minor allele frequencies and LD pat-
terns—suggest that the sensitivity to detect effects is often improved
by subsetting and does not significantly under-perform the Armitage
trend test, even under ideal conditions for the trend test.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have successfully de-
tected numerous single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) asso-
ciated with a variety of phenotypes, but the identiﬁed loci at best
explain a modest proportion of the heritable variance estimated
by twin and family studies (Manolio et al., 2009). Recent esti-
mates of the heritable variance explained by all SNPs, however,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

indicate that genome-wide SNP data does offer substantial ex-
planatory power (So at al., 2011; Yang et al., 2010). This gap of
‘missing heritability’ between heritability estimates and the SNPs
detected by GWAS has led to increasing concern over the per-
formance of GWAS, with attention focused on low power due to
the multiple testing burden and small effect sizes, as well as the
omission of rare disease alleles and epistatic effects, among
other issues (Frazer et al., 2009; Maher, 2008; Moore, 2003;
Park et al., 2010).

These shortcomings of GWAS have encouraged the applica-
tion of statistical learning (SL) methods as an alternative for
analyzing genome-wide data (Ayers and Cordell, 2010; He and
Lin, 2011; Li et al., 2011a, b; Szymczak et al., 2009; Wang et al.,
2011; Wu et al., 2010). SL methods are designed speciﬁcally for
the task of identifying meaningful predictors in high-dimensional
data, relying on data-driven algorithms rather than conventional
parametric modeling. Numerous SL methods have been
proposed for use with SNP data—including random forests
(RF; Breiman, 2001), multifactor dimensionality reduction
(Ritchie et al., 2001) and the lasso (Tibshirani, 1996)—generally
with encouraging results.

RF has received signiﬁcant attention in the genetics literature
(Bureau at al., 2005; Garcia-Magarinos et al., 2009; Goldstein
et al., 2010; Nonyane and Foulkes, 2008; Roshan et al., 2011;
Wang et al., 2009) with surprisingly less attention given to gra-
dient boosting machine (GBM; Friedman, 2001) despite its
similarity to RF. Both RF and GBM build an ensemble of
non-parametric prediction models, with each model constructed
iteratively using all available SNPs. GBM additionally applies
boosting to build each model with a focus of improving model
ﬁt for cases ﬁt poorly in the previous iteration. Importantly, the
iterative tree-building approach of RF and GBM accounts for
conditional relationships and complex causal mechanisms,
including epistasis and covariate effects, without a priori speciﬁ-
cation. Individual SNPs are then evaluated using variable
importance measures, which quantify each SNP’s total contribu-
tion to the prediction of the phenotype (Breiman, 2001; Hastie
et al., 2009). Such variable importance measures can be used to
rank-order SNPs by importance, identifying potentially inform-
ative SNPs among genome-wide data.

Studies of RF with SNP data have yielded promising results.
Simulations suggest that RF ’s power to detect causal SNPs ex-
ceeds Fisher’s exact test when epistasis is present and is still com-
parable with Fisher’s exact test when detecting main effects only

(Lunetta et al., 2004). RF maintains this advantage even if many
noise SNPs are present (Bureau at al., 2005). Applying RF to
genome-wide data is feasible, though computationally burden-
some. With empirical genome—wide data, RF is capable of repli-
cating GWAS results and identifying additional candidate SNPs
(Goldstein et al., 2010).

Although these results are encouraging, further study is neces-
sary to establish RF and GBM as Viable alternatives to GWAS
methods. Few studies of SL methods account for linkage disequi-
librium (LD), utilize realistic effect sizes or compare the sensitiv-
ity of the SL method to GWAS. Roshan et al. (2011) considered
more realistic LD and effect sizes but only focused on RF as a
second-stage analysis. Meanwhile, GBM merits further consid-
eration based on its strong performance relative to RF. Studies
show GBM performs even better than RF for many data types
(Caruana and Niculescu—Mizil, 2006; Hastie et al., 2009; Ogutu
et al., 2011) but evaluation of its performance with genome-wide
SNP data is still needed.

In addition, concerns have been raised about the impact of
minor allele frequency (MAF) and LD on the variable import-
ance measures used by RF and GBM to rank-order SNPs. With
respect to LD, importance scores for correlated functional SNPs
are inﬂated when using variable importance measures based on
the Gini criterion (Strobl et al., 2008), whereas importance scores
for functional SNPs correlated with uninformative predictors are
deﬂated (Nicodemus and Malley, 2009). Correlated predictors
do not induce bias in permutation-based importance measures,
though the variability of importance scores is decreased
(Nicodemus and Malley, 2009). MAF may also inﬂuence import-
ance scores, with higher MAF being associated with higher Gini
importance values for all SNPs, and higher permutation import-
ance values for functional SNPs (Boulesteix et al., 2011). The
inﬂuence of MAF may be attributed, at least in part, to the
tendency of the RF algorithm to prefer predictors with higher
variability (Strobl et al., 2007). Taken together, such effects may
increase the difﬁculty of detecting disease-causing variants
located in LD blocks or with low MAF, especially when using
Gini-based importance measures.

Methods for controlling the impact of MAF and LD on vari-
able importance have been proposed. To address the effect of
LD, Meng et al. (2009) introduced a modiﬁed RF algorithm and
accompanying importance measure that account for the compe-
tition between correlated SNPs for inclusion in RF models.
Strobl et al. (2008) developed a conditional permutation
scheme for the variable importance that successfully addresses
the impact of correlated predictors. Alternatively, pseudocovari-
ates (PCVs) may be added to the data to simultaneously address
the effect of all structure in the data that are unrelated to the
phenotype (Sandri and Zuccolotto, 2008, 2010).

Although each of these methods have been demonstrated to
potentially reduce the impact of LD and MAF, all three increase
the computational burden beyond what is feasible for
genome-wide data. Meng et al. (2009) speciﬁcally note that
their method does not scale to be feasible with genome-wide
data. The current implementation of the conditional methods
proposed by Strobl et al. (2008) also have substantially larger
memory requirements than conventional RF. Correction with
PCVs is similarly infeasible, effectively doubling the size of the

data and requiring a number of replications of the analysis to
establish stable estimates.

In sum, to establish RF and GBM as Viable methods for
genome-wide SNP data, it will be necessary (i) to address
concerns over the impact of LD and MAF while maintaining
computational feasibility and (ii) to provide a direct comparison
with conventional GWAS methods under realistic conditions.

In this study, we propose and evaluate a procedure designed to
reduce the impact of LD on RF, GBM or related SL methods for
genome-wide data. The proposed method creates overlapping
subsets of SNPs from a genome-wide dataset under the con-
straints that SNPs within a set are not in LD, and that each
SNPs is represented in at least a user-speciﬁed number of subsets
(see Methods). The SL method of choice can then be performed
on the subsets without concern for LD, followed by an aggre-
gation of results over subsets. Next, we show that the proposed
subsetting procedure is computationally feasible for genome-
wide data. Dividing the data into subsets makes analysis of
each piece more manageable and facilitates parallel computation
across multiple cores or on a high-performance grid for a drastic
reduction of computing time. Third, we evaluate a correction
for the impact of MAF adapted from the methods proposed
by Sandri and Zuccolotto (2008, 2010), which is computation-
ally feasible in combination with the subsetting procedure.
Speciﬁcally, in each subset, we generate a small set of independ-
ent PCVs with zero association with the phenotype, coded as
SNPs with MAF ranging from 0.01 to 0.50. Variable importance
estimates for the PCVs in each subset are aggregated to provide a
stable estimate of variable importance attributable to MAF. This
estimate can then be used to correct the importances of the em-
pirical SNPs. Finally, we provide a rigorous direct comparison of
the sensitivity of RF and GBM to the Armitage trend test (ATT;
Armitage, 1955), the test utilized most frequently in conventional
GWAS analyses (McCarthy et al., 2008; Ziegler and Konig,
2010), under realistic data conditions. Using simulated SNPs
embedded in empirical genetic data, we show that the sensitivity
of RF and GBM is broadly consistent with the ATT for SNPs
explaining as little as 1% of the phenotypic variance even under
conditions that do not leverage the advantages of RF and GBM
(i.e. a linear additive model without dominance or epistatic ef-
fects; Lunetta et al., 2004).

2 METHODS
2.1 RF/GBM analysis protocol

2.1.] Random forests RF is a machine learning algorithm
that constructs classiﬁcation or regression trees based on boot-
strap samples of the data (Breiman, 2001). Samples not used to
construct a given tree are the out-of-bag (OOB) sample. At each
node A in a tree, a random subset of the predictors of size mtry is
searched to ﬁnd the predictor that partitions the data into the
subsets that are most homogeneous with respect to the outcome
variable. Thus for a case—control phenotype y, at a node A, the
RF algorithm seeks the SNP with split 5 that maximizes the
decrease in heterogeneity

ARSaA) = I(A) - P(AL)I(AL) - P(AR)I(AR), (1)

Reduced impact of MAF and LD

 

where AL and AR are the left and right daughter nodes result-
ing from split 5, P(A) is the probability of being placed in
node A by split 5, and I(-) is the Gini criterion
I(A) = 2P(y = 0|A)P(y = 1|A) (Hastie et al., 2009). The prob-
abilities may be weighted based on a user-speciﬁed vector of
prior probabilities classwt (Liaw and Wiener, 2002).

On the basis of the ensemble of trees, RF provides two meas-
ures of the importance of each SNP. The Gini importance meas-
ures the average value of Equation (1) in nodes split using a given
SNP. The mean decrease in accuracy (MDA) importance is the
average decrease in accuracy in classifying the DOB sample after
permuting the given SNP (Breiman, 2002).

Analyses with RF were performed in R (R Development Core
Team, 2011) using the randomForest package (Liaw and Wiener,
2002). Forests were grown to 5000 trees. The number of pre-
dictors attempted at each node, mtry, was set to 0.1 p, where
p is the number of predictors in the data. These settings are
consistent with the recommendations of Goldstein et al. (2010)
for genome-wide data. In addition, prior probabilities (classwt)
and voting thresholds (cuttoﬂs‘) were set equal to the case/control
proportions for the observed phenotype in each analysis. All
settings were chosen based on performance in pilot testing with
real and simulated data (not shown).

2.1.2 Gradient boosting machine GBM, like RF, is an ensem-
ble method based on classiﬁcation and regression trees con-
structed using bootstrap samples of the data. Unlike RF,
however, each tree is ﬁt to weighted residuals based on the pre-
vious trees in the ensemble. The contribution of each newly
added tree to the prediction is limited by a shrinkage parameter.
Similar to RF, variable importances are computed based on the
average improvement in prediction from nodes split using a given
SNP (Friedman, 2001).

Analyses with GBM were completed using the gbm package
for R (Ridgeway, 2010). As with RF, the settings for GBM were
based on pilot testing with empirical and simulated data. We
used a 0.001 shrinkage parameter, 3000 trees and limited tree
construction depth to ﬁrst-order interactions.

2.2 LD subsetting algorithm

To reduce the effect of LD on variable importance, we propose
an algorithm to select overlapping subsets of SNPs prior to
analysis, such that the SNPs in each subset are in approximate
linkage equilibrium and each SNP from the genome-wide
data appears in at least a user-speciﬁed number of subsets. Sub-
sequently, subsets are analyzed separately and results are
aggregated.

The proposed algorithm creates subsets of SNPs from each
chromosome, then combines these subsets to create genome-wide
subsets. First, for chromosome 0, let Dc be the N x pc data
matrix of the pc SNPs on chromosome c ordered according to
map location. To prevent order effects, begin by permuting the
columns of Dc within blocks of size b, where b is some small
positive integer. In other words, randomly permute the order of
columns 1 to b, columns b+1 to 2b , . .. of Dc to get the new
data matrix Di.

To construct the zth subset for chromosome c, we ﬁrst select
the SNPs associated with columns 2, z+k, 2+ 2k,  of Di,

where z and k are positive integers. Selecting k subsets in this
way guarantees that every SNP in D: is selected once. Additional
sets of k subsets can be constructed to ensure each SNP appears
in a user-speciﬁed number of subsets, requiring 5 sets of k subsets
to guarantee that each SNP is included in at least 5 subsets. The
value of k is chosen by the researcher such that k—2b is greater
than the size (in number of SNPs) of the largest anticipated
LD block in order to ensure that the SNPs in columns
2, z + k, z + 2k, .. . of D: will not be in LD. The selection of k
should be guided by using Haploview (Barrett et al., 2005) or
other software to tag LD blocks in regions known to have the
largest LD blocks (or the lowest recombination rate), and setting
k slightly larger than the number of SNPs in the largest observed
LD block.

Next, the subsets are augmented by adding additional
SNPs that are in approximate linkage equilibrium with the
initially selected SNPs, where linkage equilibrium is oper-
ationally deﬁned by a user-speciﬁed maximum pairwise correl-
ation t. These additional SNPs are selected by searching the
intervals between the selected SNPs (e. g. columns 1 to
z — 1, z + 1 to z + k — 1, . . . of DE). Within each interval, begin
by removing from consideration SNPs that correlate above some
correlation threshold t with the previously selected SNPs before
or after the interval. For instance, for the interval from z + 1 to
z+k— 1, SNPs correlated with the zth or z+kth SNPs, which
have already been selected for subset z, are removed from con-
sideration. For this study, we use a threshold of t: 0.1. Of the
remaining SNPs, one SNP is randomly selected to be added to
the zth subset. Any additional SNPs in the interval that correlate
with the newly selected SNP greater than the threshold t are then
removed from consideration. Continue randomly selecting SNPs
in this way until no SNPs remain below the correlation threshold
to be considered.

Once this procedure is ﬁnished, the zth subset for chromosome
c is complete. The zth genome-wide subset is then deﬁned by the
union of the zth subset from each chromosome. Pseudocode
summarizing the full algorithm is given in Figure 1. The desired
SL method may then be run on each subset, and the importance
of a given SNP is computed as its mean observed importance
across subsets containing the SNP.

2.3 Correction of importances with PCVs

Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) proposed correcting variable im-
portances by augmenting the data with PCVs, a second copy of
the original predictor variables with the rows permuted to dis-
rupt any association with the outcome variable while maintain-
ing the structure among the predictors. The observed variable
importance of the PCVs across a number of replications provides
an estimate of the importance due to the structure of the pre-
dictors. The importance of each PCV can then be subtracted
from the importance of the corresponding predictor to estimate
the importance of the given predictor that is due to association
with the outcome variable.

The LD subsetting algorithm does not itself address the issue
of MAF but it does provide an opportunity to adapt the ap-
proach of Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) to estimate and correct
for the importance due to MAF while maintaining computa-
tional feasibility for genome-wide data. For each subset from
the LD subsetting algorithm, independent PCVs are generated
from Bin (2, p,), where the p,- are evenly spaced on [0.01, 0.50] at
intervals of 0.001 to fully capture the range of MAF values in
GWAS data. These 491 PCVs are then appended to the subset of
SNP data and analyzed with the selected SL method. After all
subsets are analyzed, the importances are averaged to produce a
single variable importance for each PCV.

Next, a loess regression curve is ﬁt to the observed variable
importances of the PCVs to estimate the expected importance at
each MAF. The loess curve is selected to provide a smooth esti-
mate without requiring speciﬁcation of the non-linear relation-
ship between MAF and variable importance (Supplementary
Fig. S1). In this way, we obtain expected importances due to
the effect of MAF only for MAF values in [0.01, 0.50].

The expected importance at each MAF can then be used
to correct the importances that are observed when using RF
or GBM. Speciﬁcally, for a given SNP with MAF m, subtract
the expected importance at m, as estimated by the loess curve,
from the observed importance for the SNP. The remaining im-
portance for the SNP can be attributed to association with the
phenotype.

Finally, to account for differences in the variability of the im-
portance measure attributable to MAF, the corrected import-
ance of the SNP is scaled by the standard deviation across
subsets of the importance of the PCV with p,- closest to the
MAF m. This is analogous to constructing a 2 statistic, with
the PCVs providing an estimate of the mean and standard devi-
ation for the null distribution of variable importances condi-
tional on MAF. The resulting corrected variable importance
may then be used to compare SNPs as usual.

Note that our proposed implementation of PCVs differs from
Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010) on two key points. First, we gen-
erate PCVs as a small number of random binomial variables with
varying MAFs, rather than using permuted rows from the data.
This modiﬁcation is justiﬁable because after LD subsetting the
only known problematic structure in the data is variation in
MAF. Second, we proﬁt from the fact that we can include the
small set of PCVs in each LD subset instead of having to perform
multiple replications with the full data to get a stable estimate of
the effect of MAF, allowing us to maintain computational feasi-
bility for genome-wide data.

2.4 Embedding simulated SNP in empirical data

For this study of the impact of LD and MAF on variable im-
portance, we simulate data for a SNP in LD with a range of
MAF values. Speciﬁcally, we use an iterative procedure to simu-
late a SNP that correlates with an existing empirical SNP at a
given correlation p and with a speciﬁed MAF . By embedding the
simulated SNP in empirical SNP data, we are able to maintain a
realistic data structure for the simulation studies. A different
option would be to use one of the empirical SNPs and generate
a phenotype value, but such an approach gives less control on
LD and MAF and would require different locations of the target
SNP for the different simulation settings.

To generate the simulated SNP, a continuous variable is gen-
erated ﬁrst by adding noise drawn from N(0,02) to an existing
empirical SNP with complete data. Quantile thresholds based on
the desired MAF, under the assumption of Hardy—Weinberg
equilibrium, are applied to the continuous variable to create dis-
crete SNP data. The correlation between the generated SNP and
the existing SNP is controlled by adjusting 02 for the noise.
Decreasing 02 increases LD with the empirical SNP, whereas
increasing 02 has the reverse effect. Adjustments to 02 are
made iteratively until the observed LD and MAF are within
0.01 of the desired values.

The possible correlation between a pair of SNPs is bounded by
the difference in MAF. As a result, it is not possible to generate
data for a wide range of values of MAF that still have a high
correlation p with a single empirical SNP. Using formulas from
Biswas and Hwang (2002), it is possible to establish the upper
bound for p at the population level for two SNPs with given
MAFs. In ﬁnite samples, it is possible to achieve correlations
that are somewhat higher than these bounds, but limitations
are still present (Supplementary Information). As a result,
some combinations of MAF and LD are omitted from simula-
tions involving correlation with the empirical SNP, which has
MAF m=0.286, limiting the consideration of p=0.9 to only
simulated SNPs with MAF m = 0.3.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Evaluation of LD subsetting algorithm

As a baseline measurement of the impact of LD and MAF on
variable importance in RF and GBM, both RF and GBM were
used to analyze data containing a simulated SNP embedded in a
3000 SNP region of empirical data on N: 2235 individuals from
a published study of hair morphology (Medland et al., 2009). An
LD map of the 3000 empirical SNPs is shown in Supplementary
Figure S2.

The simulated SNP was generated with one of four levels of
LD (i.e. correlation p = 0, 0.3, 0.6, 0.9 with the neighboring em-
pirical SNP) and one of ﬁve levels of MAF (m=0.05, 0.1, 0.2,
0.3, 0.5). LD and MAF levels were fully crossed, excluding con-
ditions where data generation is not possible (see Methods). A
case/control phenotype unrelated to the SNPs was generated
with a probability 0.36 of being a case. Resulting variable im-
portance measures from RF and GBM were collected for 250
replications for each combination of LD and MAF. Replications
with invalid data generation were discarded.

Reduced impact of MAF and LD

 

Given a null phenotype, any observed systematic differences in
variable importance can be attributed to MAF and to LD with
the neighboring SNP. The effect of LD and MAF were tested
using the non-parametric Kruskal—Wallis analysis of variance
due to the skewed distribution of variable importances
(Kruskal and Wallis, 1952). Signiﬁcant results imply that the
variable importances from the tested conditions do not have
the same population distribution.

Replicating the ﬁndings of Boulesteix et al. (2011), a highly
signiﬁcant effect of MAF on the RF Gini importance of the
simulated SNP is observed at each level of LD (Table 1).
GBM produces very similar results. Although not previously es-
tablished, the similarity of GBM importance measures to RF
makes this result unsurprising.

In addition, a highly signiﬁcant effect of LD on the RF Gini
importance is observed at each level of MAF. Strong effects for
GBM and the RF MDA importance are also observed when
m=0.3 (Table 1). The observed effect is likely stronger here
due to the inclusion of the higher LD condition p: 0.9, which
can only be considered for MAF m = 0.3 due to the restrictions
on correlation for binomial variables (see Methods). Plots of the
median importance for GBM for each condition clearly suggest a
trend toward a similar effect for other levels of MAF (Fig. 2a),
though the corresponding Kruskal—Wallis tests are non-
signiﬁcant. Similar trends are observed for RF (Supplementary
Figs S3a and S4a).

3.1.1 Improvement from LD subsetting algorithm Applying
the proposed LD subsetting algorithm to the simulated data
with 821 set of k=300 subsets results in a drastic reduction
in the effect of LD on the resulting aggregated importances for
GBM and RF. Importantly, the process of aggregating results
from the subsets does not favor any given SNPs based on the
number of subsets containing the SNP (Supplementary Informa-
tion). After correcting for multiple testing, the Kruskal—Wallis
test shows no signiﬁcant effect of LD for GBM. Note also that
large effects of MAF are still observed (Table 1). The improve-
ment due to subsetting is especially evident at the m = 0.30 level.
Plots of the median variable importance in each condition

similarly show no systematic trend related to LD (Fig. 2b).
Dramatic improvements are also observed for RF
(Supplementary Table S1 and Figs S3b and S4b).

3.2 Impact on computational feasibility

In addition to reducing the effect of LD, the LD subsetting
algorithm facilitates distribution of the analysis across a grid
environment. For example, using a single core on a server with
Dual Six-Core AMD Opteron Model 2431 CPUs, RF requires
over 19h and 3.5 GB of RAM to complete an analysis of chro-
mosome 22 from the complete empirical data (30 218 SNPs). In
contrast, the subsets created by the subsetting algorithm can each
be analyzed with RF with 1.3 GB of RAM in ~44 min. Creating
the subsets themselves requires 30 min and 1.8 GB of RAM, and
negligible resources are required to aggregate the ﬁnal results. If
a grid environment is available to process 50 of the k=300

Signiﬁcance test results are given for uncorrected variable importances in RF and GBM, as well as for the GBM importance with LD subsetting and with PCVs. Results show
the similar impact of MAF and LD on the RF Gini and GBM importances, the reduced effect of LD after subsetting, and the reduced effect of MAF after correction with
PCVs. Tests are performed for the simple effect of MAF at a given LD p, and for the simple effect of LD at a given MAF m. With Bonferroni corrections for family-wise

a: 0.05, P-values for the effect of MAF <l.7 X 10‘2, and P-values for the effect of LD <l X 104 indicate signiﬁcant effects.

subsets in parallel, using LD subsets with RF yields a 75% re-
duction in the time required to complete the analysis, and a 49%
reduction in the maximum RAM required. Even greater reduc-
tions are observed for GBM, shrinking the computational
burden from 10h and 4.3 GB of RAM for the full chromosome
to 7min and 0.5 GB of RAM per subset, yielding a 57% reduc-
tion in the maximum RAM requirement and a 89% reduction in
total computing time in a grid environment with 50 parallel
cores. Supplementary Table S2 details these results.

3.3 Addition of PCVs

The subsets created by the LD subsetting algorithm offer an
opportunity to include PCVs. Since there are ~50 000 SNPs in
each subset when 300 subsets are produced for genome-wide data
containing ~2million SNPs, 491PCVs are a modest addition
with a negligible impact on the computational burden.

Given the similar performance of RF and GBM, and the
larger computational burden of RF, we focus on evaluating
PCVs with GBM. Table 1 reports the results of 250 replications
of GBM with the PCV correction. Although a signiﬁcant effect
of MAF remains at p = 0 and p = 0.6, the magnitude of the effect
is drastically reduced (Fig. 20). Note that the negative GBM
importances are an artifact of the positively skewed distribution
of importances; using PCVs to center the mean importance of a
SNP with no effect at zero yields a negative median for the
skewed distribution. SNPs with a true effect are still expected
to have positive importances (see Section 3.4).

3.4 Sensitivity to functional SNPs

The results thus far show a reduction of the inﬂuence of LD and
MAF on the variable importance for SNPs with no association
with the phenotype. To model the effect of LD and MAF on
variable importance for functional SNPs, three sets of 28 simu-
lated SNPs were embedded in the 3000 SNP region used previ-
ously. The three sets were generated with MAF m = 0.1, 0.3 and
0.5, respectively, and embedded avoiding disruption of LD
blocks in the empirical data.

Each set of 28 SNPs contains three LD blocks of four SNPs
each with p=0.9, three LD blocks with p=0.5 and one block
with p: 0. The LD and MAF conditions used here differ from
the previous simulation to provide a less complex setting while
still covering a full range of LD and MAF values. Among the 28
simulated SNPs, there are six functional SNPs, jointly explaining
9% of the variance in a continuous outcome variable, which is
then dichotomized to a case/control phenotype. Speciﬁcally,
within each set of SNPs, x1, . . . ,ng, SNPs x1, x13 and 3625,
each explain 2% of the variance in the continuous outcome,
and x5, x17 and 3626 each explain 1% of the variance
(Supplementary Fig. S5). This design fully crosses effect size by
LD within each set of 28 SNPs, crossed by MAF for the three
sets.

We focus our analysis on the functional SNPs with the more
realistic effect size of 1% variance explained (x5, x17 and x26).
Results for tag SNPs and the remaining functional SNPs are
available in the Supplementary Information. In addition to test-
ing the effect of MAF and LD on the resulting variable import-
ances, we also consider the sensitivity of each method to identify
functional SNPs. Since RF and GBM do not include formal

signiﬁcance testing, we deﬁne the detection rate as the proportion
of replications in which the observed importance for a given
functional SNP exceeds the highest observed importance
among the simulated non-effect SNPs.

3.4.1 Uncorrected RF and GBM To again establish a base-
line, variable importances from RF and GBM were collected for
250 replications without the LD subsetting algorithm or PCVs.
Figure 3a illustrates the resulting median GBM importance
values for the simulated SNPs (for RF see Supplementary Figs
S6a and S7a). Comparing the three functional SNPs suggests a
strong effect of LD, with lower importance given to the SNPs in
strong LD. The effect of LD is signiﬁcant for GBM and the RF
Gini importance according to the Friedman test and approaches
signiﬁcance for the RF MDA importance (Table 2). The Fried-
man test, a non-parametric equivalent of the repeated measures
analysis of variance, is applied here due to the skewed distribu-
tion of the importances and the dependence among the import-
ances of SNPs together in a replication (Friedman, 1937).

The results also seem to suggest a modest effect of MAF for
each functional SNP, but the effect is only signiﬁcant for the RF
Gini importance. Unexpectedly, lower variable importance is
observed for functional SNPs with high MAF (Fig. 3a) com-
pared with the higher importance observed for null SNPs with
high MAF (Fig. 2a). Further analysis, however, suggests this is
an artifact of the differing magnitude of the regression coefﬁ-
cients required to maintain equal effect sizes while varying MAF
(Supplementary Information).

Table 3 reports the detection rates for GBM, along with exact
95% conﬁdence intervals for the proportion as deﬁned by
Clopper and Pearson (1934). Corresponding results for RF are
reported in Supplementary Table S3. The raw values are of little
interest but yield a basis for comparison with other methods.

3.4.2 LD subsetting algorithm As observed for null SNPs,
introducing LD subsetting reduces the impact of LD on variable
importance for functional SNPs (Fig. 3b). With LD subsetting,
the effect of LD on variable importance is non-signiﬁcant after

‘Detection’ in each replication is deﬁned as importance (or test statistic) for a functional SNP greater than the highest observed importance among simulated
SNPs unassociated with the phenotype. Results are given for the ATT, uncorrected GBM importance, GBM with LD subsetting, and GBM with PCVs,
showing that in most cases the detection rate for GBM-based methods is within sampling error of the ATT. Proportions are out of 250 replications. Values in

bold have conﬁdence intervals that overlap the conﬁdence interval for the detection rate of the ATT.

correction for multiple testing (Table 2). LD subsetting also in-
creases the relative importance of tag SNPs in LD with a func-
tional SNP, reducing the downward pressure on the importance
of SNPs in a strong LD block (Supplementary Fig. S8). Similar
results are observed for RF (Supplementary Table S4).

Investigation of the detection rates for GBM with and without
LD subsetting shows LD subsetting markedly improves detec-
tion of the functional SNPs in LD blocks. In exchange, there is a
modest decrease in the detection rate for SNPs not in LD, espe-
cially at low MAF (Table 3). For RF, LD subsetting improves
detection rates for the MDA importance but signiﬁcantly im-
pairs detection of functional SNPs with low MAF when using
the Gini importance (Supplementary Table S3), likely due a
strengthened effect of MAF.

3.4.3 PC V correction Although the effect of MAF on the
importance of effect SNPs after LD subsetting is non-signiﬁcant
(Table 2), the inclusion of PCVs to correct for MAF may still be

desirable to at least partially address the impact of MAF on the
importance of null SNPs. As before, the computational burden
of RF leads us to focus on the results for GBM.

Figure 3c depicts the resulting GBM variable importances
after inclusion of PCVs. Although the effect of LD remains
non-signiﬁcant, there is a strong, signiﬁcant effect of MAF on
the importances (Table 2). This result is unsurprising given that
the trend of GBM variable importances associated with MAF
works in the opposite direction for functional SNPs compared
with non-effect SNPs. By adjusting the importance to account
for the inﬂated importance of non-effect SNPs with high MAF,
the PCV correction strengthens the trend toward lower import-
ance for functional SNPs with high MAF values. As before, the
resulting trend in variable importances may be interpreted as
reﬂecting the magnitude of regression coefﬁcients rather than a
direct effect of MAF (see Supplementary Information).

The impact of including PCVs on the detection rate is more
limited. Analyses using GBM with PCVs show slightly higher

detection rates for SNPs with low MAF, and a moderate
decrease in detection rates for SNPs with higher MAF, but the
difference is generally within sampling variation (Table 3).

3.4.4 Armitage trend test To establish the usefulness of SL
methods for genome-wide data, it is important to compare
their performance to conventional methods. Since the current
simulations rely on the same additive genetic model assumed
by the ATT, we do not anticipate that RF and GBM will provide
any improvement over the detection rate of the ATT. Instead, we
hope to show that even under ideal circumstances for the ATT,
little sensitivity is lost by using RF and GBM, such that RF and
GBM may improve sensitivity to epistatic and non-additive ef-
fects without substantial sacriﬁces of sensitivity to additive
effects.

Comparison of the detection rates for GBM with the ATT
indicates that in most conditions the difference between the
two methods is within the range of sampling variation, especially
when LD subsetting is used (Table 3). Indeed, there is a strong
Visual similarity between the pattern of observed P—Values for the
ATT and the corresponding variable importances from GBM
with LD subsetting (Supplementary Figs S8b and S9). Results
for RF are somewhat weaker (Supplementary Table S3). Note
that in order to maintain a fair comparison, we deﬁne detection
for the ATT by treating the test statistic as an analog to the
variable importance rather than requiring statistical signiﬁcance.
In sum, it appears GBM, with the aid of LD subsetting, does not
substantially under-perform the ATT, even under ideal circum-
stances for the ATT.

4 DISCUSSION

SL methods such as RF and GBM are a Viable alternative to
conventional parametric testing of individual SNPs in a GWAS.
However, there are valid concerns over the impact of LD and
MAF on variable importance measures that must be addressed.
In response, this study presents an integrated approach to mean-
ingfully reduce the effect of LD and MAF on variable import-
ance in RF and GBM.

The results of this study show that the proposed subsetting
algorithm can successfully reduce or eliminate the effect of LD
on the variable importance measures of RF and GBM. The pro-
cess of aggregating results over the subsets is not biased by the
number of subsets containing a given SNP and, in many cases,
may aid the detection of effect SNPs. In particular, the use of LD
subsetting can be expected to aid RF and GBM is identifying
effect SNPs within LD blocks. Since LD subsets are constructed
prior to analysis, the procedure could also be applied to other SL
methods.

Importantly, GBM provides detection rates for the functional
SNPs within sampling variation of detection rates for the ATT.
This result for GBM is especially encouraging given that this
study uses an additive genetic model that precisely matches the
type of effect anticipated by the ATT. SL methods may be
expected to provide substantial improvement over the ATT for
detecting correlated effect SNPs and SNPs with non-additive and
epistatic effects (Garcia-Magarinos et al., 2009). Alternatively,
RF and GBM may act as an initial screen to reduce genome-wide
data to a set of candidate SNPs small enough to make thorough

modeling of their complex relationships feasible using penalized
regression or other appropriate methods (Ayers and Cordell,
2010).

The LD subsetting approach also facilitates the introduction
of PCVs, as proposed by Sandri and Zuccolotto (2010), which
may potentially be used to correct for the effect of MAF on
variable importance measures. The proposed PCV correction
evaluated in this study provides a marked reduction in the
effect of MAF on non-effect SNPs. Caution is necessary in
applying PCVs, however, given a moderate effect of MAF re-
mains and the effect of MAF on the importance of functional
SNPs may be magniﬁed, with uncertain implications
(Supplementary Information). Still, PCVs at minimum provide
the option of emphasizing sensitivity to SNPs with low MAF,
which may contain the majority of heritable variance for some
phenotypes, such as high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol
(Park et al., 2011), and can be difﬁcult to detect with conven-
tional methods WVang et al., 2005). Finally, in addition to PCVs
numerous covariates for comorbid disorders, environmental fac-
tors and other inﬂuential variables may be included in the ana-
lysis with a much lower computational cost than for popular
GWAS software (Shabalin, 2012).

A number of factors may be considered in seeking to improve
the approaches evaluated by this study. More careful tuning of
the metaparameters for the LD subsetting algorithm, including
the selection of k, b and t, may enhance the effectiveness of the
correction. Alternative methods to improve the use of PCVs to
correct for the effect of MAF may also be explored. The correc-
tion proposed here is only one possible application of PCVs;
other versions may improve the effectiveness of PCVs or carry
different advantages tailored to the preferences of the researcher.
Finally, these results show strong results for GBM that are con-
sistent with the more widely known RF; additional work should
be performed to evaluate GBM as a Viable tool for analyzing
genome-wide data, especially given its lighter computational
burden.

Although our approach does not fully eliminate the impact of
LD and MAF on variable importance measures, the proposed
corrections provide a satisfying improvement. Importantly, LD
subsetting also facilitates analysis in a parallel environment, im-
proving the computational feasibility of these methods for
genome-wide data. Continuing efforts to establish the validity,
reliability and feasibility of SL methods such as RF and GBM
with genome-wide data will be crucial to establishing these meth-
ods as Viable alternatives to conventional GWAS analyses.

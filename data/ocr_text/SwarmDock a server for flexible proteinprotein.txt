ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein—protein interactions are central to almost all biolo-
gical functions, and the atomic details of such interactions can yield
insights into the mechanisms that underlie these functions. We present
a web server that wraps and extends the SwarmDock flexible protein—
protein docking algorithm. After uploading PDB files of the binding
partners, the server generates low energy conformations and returns
a ranked list of clustered docking poses and their corresponding
structures. The user can perform full global docking, or focus on par-
ticular residues that are implicated in binding. The server is validated in
the CAPRI blind docking experiment, against the most current docking
benchmark, and against the ClusPro docking server, the highest
performing server currently available.

Availability: The server is freely available and can be accessed at:

1 INTRODUCTION

The great majority of biological functions are mediated not by
isolated proteins but by their interactions. Physically, any two
proteins can interact. However, interactions of biological signiﬁ-
cance exist Via the pairing of complementary surfaces, and
modelling the three-dimensional structure of protein—protein
complexes remains a highly active research ﬁeld.

We recently described the SwarmDock ﬂexible docking algo-
rithm for docking and clustering (Li et al., 2010; Moal and Bates,
2010). This algorithm has been used in the CAPRI blind docking
experiment (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/msd-er/capri/), where experi-
mentally determined protein—protein complexes are held in con-
ﬁdence by the organizing committee while the prediction
community are invited to predict their structure. Since the last
assessment period in May 2010, SwarmDock correctly identiﬁed
interfaces in seven of the nine targets, a success rate that sur-
passes all but one of the other participating teams. We have now

automated the docking pipeline, from structure preparation to
clustering. We present here the SwarmDock server, which pro-
vides the research community with a simple and easy to use
interface to the methodology. This automated server has been
used in CAPRI without human intervention since round 26, and
has correctly identiﬁed the structure of all three targets, two of
which were not found by any other server. A typical docking run
using the server will take up to 36 h, depending on the size of the
complex and whether the resources are shared. The server does
not, at this time, support non-protein docking.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The SwarmDock algorithm has been described previously
(Li et al., 2010; Moal and Bates, 2010). Brieﬂy, a combination
of local docking and particle swarm optimization is used to
ﬁnd low energy positions and orientations of the binding part-
ners. Normal modes are used as a component of the optimization
vector to model transitions between unbound and bound con-
formations. The original scoring function has been replaced
with DComplex (Liu et al., 2004), and the structures are rescored
using the centroid potential described by Tobi (2010) prior
to clustering, as these modiﬁcations considerably improved the
performance of the algorithm (results not shown).

Uploaded PDB structures of the binding partners should con-
form to three simple requirements: a TER keyword should be
placed after each chain, standard residues should be used and
structures should preferably not have missing residues. However,
if the last two requirement cannot be met, the server will try to
replace non-standard residues and model missing residues or
residues with missing atoms. After the structures are repaired,
they are minimized, docked, minimized again, and then clustered
as described previously.

To submit a job, the user can choose between the full-blind
docking or local docking with restraints. Starting points are gen-
erated uniformly around the receptor. In the latter method, the
user may choose the residues belonging to the binding site and
consequently the server only uses the starting points in the
line of sight of at least one of the chosen receptors residues.
Consequently, the server only produces solutions in the region
of the receptor site chosen by the user.

Upon completion of the computations, the user receives an
email with a link to download the repaired input structures,
the docked structures, a ranked list of clusters, details about
the residue contacts and the SwarmDock output ﬁle.

Note: For SwarmDock, results are shown for all 176 structures in the Benchmark 4.0, as well as the subset of 29 structures. Results are given when considering only the lowest energy member of each cluster, or all members of

each cluster. For ClusPro, results are shown when using the balanced ClusPro scoring function and the electrostatically biased scoring function. The other scoring functions evaluated did not perform as well and are not shown.

3 BENCHMARK

Benchmark 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010) is the most current and up to
date benchmark for docking algorithms. Unbound structures
were repaired by the SwarmDock server and all the 176 cases
(121 rigid body, 30 medium difﬁculty, 25 difﬁcult) were
re—docked, from the unbound receptor/ligand conformations.
The server correctly parsed the structures and returned results
for all 176 cases. The docking was evaluated by calculating inter-
face RMSD, ligand RMSD and the fraction of native and
non-native contacts, and solutions were then classiﬁed as incor-
rect, acceptable, medium or high quality, in accordance with the
CAPRI criteria (Lensink et al., 2007). The detailed results are
presented in the Supplementary Material. The success rate for
blind docking, the number of complexes for which at least one
acceptable solution was found, is 71.6%. A more detailed ana-
lysis of the results is shown in Table 1.

We also benchmarked SwarmDock against ClusPro, a popular
protein—protein docking server (Comeau et al., 2004). ClusPro has
consistently outperformed all other servers in the previous and
current CAPRI assessment periods, and thus represents the
state-of-the-art. We chose a subset of structures to compare the
servers: all 19 medium difﬁculty and difﬁcult complexes from
update 4.0 of the Benchmark and 10 rigid-body complexes
chosen uniformly. ClusPro returned solutions for all 29 cases. In
7 cases, both servers did not ﬁnd a solution. In 9 cases, SwarmDock
found a correct solution whereas ClusPro did not, and there were
no cases of ClusPro ﬁnding a solution where SwarmDock
could not. Further comparison between the servers is presented
in Table 1, which also shows the higher performance of Swarm
Dock in terms of the quality of docked solutions and their ranking.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The SwarmDock server is a tool for predicting the three-
dimensional structure of protein—protein complexes. Uploaded
structures are automatically repaired, and the server is robust
and easy to use. Docking may be performed in two modes: as
full blind when nothing is known about interface residues, or in
restrained mode, when information about interface residues may
be used to restrict the search space. For the full blind mode, tests
were performed on the most recent docking benchmark, achiev-
ing a success rate of 71.6% when considering all solutions, and
36.4% when considering only the top 10. The full blind mode
was also compared with ClusPro, the most successful docking
server to date. The SwarmDock algorithm has also been used for
generating structures for one of highest performing groups in
CAPRI, and the automated server presented here has correctly
identiﬁed the structure of all three complexes in the CAPRI
rounds it has participated in, including two targets for which
no other servers returned correct results.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Antibodies are currently the most important class of
biopharmaceuticals. Development of such antibody-based drugs
depends on costly and time-consuming screening campaigns.
Computational techniques such as antibody—antigen docking hold
the potential to facilitate the screening process by rapidly providing
a list of initial poses that approximate the native complex.

Results: We have developed a new method to identify the epitope
region on the antigen, given the structures of the antibody and the
antigen—EpiPred. The method combines conformational matching of
the antibody—antigen structures and a specific antibody—antigen
score. We have tested the method on both a large non-redundant
set of antibody—antigen complexes and on homology models of the
antibodies and/or the unbound antigen structure. On a non-redundant
test set, our epitope prediction method achieves 44% recall at 14%
precision against 23% recall at 14% precision for a background
random distribution. We use our epitope predictions to rescore the
global docking results of two rigid-body docking algorithms: ZDOCK
and ClusPro. In both cases including our epitope, prediction increases
the number of near-native poses found among the top decoys.

1 INTRODUCTION

Antibodies are the key protein factors in the acquired immune
responses in vertebrates. The most common human antibody
isotype is the IgG, which is one of the main mediators of second-
ary immune responses (Kuroda et al., 2012; Raghunathan et al.,
2012; Sela-Culang et al., 2013). Antibodies have a conserved
structure with >l700 solved structures available in the Protein
Data Bank (Berman et al., 2000; Dunbar et al., 2013). Most of
the variability in antibodies (both sequence and structure) can
be found in the antigen binding site, which is chieﬂy composed
of the complementarity-determining region loops (CDRs)
(Raghunathan et al., 2012). The affinity and speciﬁcity of the
antibody’s cognate antigen can be effectively modulated by
only a few mutations to the CDRs (Raghunathan et al., 2012).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Owing to their malleable binding properties, antibodies are cur-
rently one of the most important biopharmaceuticals (Murad
et al., 2012; Wark and Hudson, 2003).

The majority of the technologies used for artificial antibody
design are based on costly screening campaigns. However, there
is a growing number of computational methods aimed at aiding
the process of artificial antibody design (Kuroda et al., 2012).
Two areas of computational antibody design are the focus of this
manuscript: B-cell epitope prediction (e.g. EL-Manzalawy and
Honavar, 2010; Yao et al., 2013) and global antibody—antigen
docking (e.g. Brenke et al., 2012).

Given a sequence or structure of an antigen, in silico B-cell
epitope prediction aims to identify a set of residues on the anti-
gen capable of binding an antibody (Kringelum et al., 2012).
Many successful B-cell epitope prediction methods rely on struc-
tural information but sequence alone can also produce useful
predictions (Lin et al., 2013). The majority of current methods
operate without antibody information, aiming to identify all po-
tential antibody binding sites (Kuroda et al., 2012; Sela-Culang
et al., 2013). Attempting to map all epitopes might not be opti-
mal because some antigens, such as hen egg white lysozyme, have
been shown to form complexes with many different antibodies.
These bind to different areas, meaning that most of the lyso-
zyme’s surface constitutes a part of some epitope (Sela-Culang
et al., 2013). Moreover, it has been shown that two different
therapeutic antibodies, Gevokizumab and Canakinumab, acti-
vate two distinct pathways by binding to different epitopes of
IL—lﬂ (Blech et al., 2012). In this article, we create antibody-
specific epitope predictions, as we believe these will be more
useful for the development of therapeutic antibodies (Soga
et al., 2010; Zhao and Li, 2010; Zhao et al., 2011).

Computational B-cell epitope prediction provides information
about the regions of the antigen bound by the antibody but it
does not directly contribute to the knowledge of the particular
antibody residues that need to be mutated so as to modify its
function. This problem can be tackled by antibody—antigen
docking, which, given the structure of the antibody and the anti-
gen, provides a list of putative orientations of the two molecules
with respect to each other. Antibody—antigen docking requires
different methodology from that used for the corresponding
problem concerning non-antibody targets (Brenke et al., 2012;
Mendez et al., 2005). This is because antibodies use different
residues in their binding sites when compared with both general
proteins and antigens and thus an asymmetric scoring system is
required that accounts for these discrepancies (Brenke et al.,
2012; Krawczyk et al., 2013).

Improving B-cell epitope prediction

 

In this manuscript, we focus on epitope prediction and global
docking and how those two methods in concert can facilitate
computational artiﬁcial antibody design. We develop an anti-
body-speciﬁc epitope prediction method EpiPred, which uses
geometric matching of the antibody and antigen interfaces
coupled with an antibody—antigen-speciﬁc knowledge-based po-
tential. We use our epitope predictions to rescore the global
docking results of two fast rigid-body docking algorithms,
ZDOCK and ClusPro server in antibody mode (Brenke et al.,
2012; Chen et al., 2003). We demonstrate that including the epi-
tope information in our global docking pipeline enriches the top
decoys with more native poses.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data

A non-redundant dataset of crystal structures was downloaded from the
structural antibody database (SAbDAb; Dunbar et al., 2013) in August
2013. The complexes were selected such that no two antibodies shared
>99% sequence identity and the corresponding antigens shared not
>90% sequence identity. All antigens were proteins as deﬁned by
SAbDab (>50 residues) and the complexes had to be of resolution 3 A
or better. The ﬁnal dataset consisted of 148 structures (SAbDab-nr), 30
of which were chosen at random to constitute the test set, referred to as
X-test. The homology model dataset, H-test, consisted of 15 antibody—
antigen complexes as used by Krawczyk et al. (2013) and Sircar and Gray
(2010). These are model structures built with RosettaAntibody
(Sivasubramanian et al., 2009). The homology models we obtained did
not have the H3 loop modeled so these were modeled using FREAD
(Choi and Deane, 2011, 2010). The PDB codes and the corresponding
chains of structures used in this study are given in the Supplementary
Section 1.

2.2 Epitope prediction

2.2.] Epitope prediction algorithm Our epitope prediction algo-
rithm is a combination of geometric ﬁtting and a knowledge-based asym-
metric antibody—antigen scoring. The algorithm is divided into three
steps.

Firstly, epitope-like surface patches on the antigen are enumerated.
These are designed to be roughly the same size as the approximate epi-
topes used in our earlier local docking study (Krawczyk et al., 2013). An
epitope is deﬁned here as surface antigen residues (>7% A ASA) whose
heavy atoms are within 4.5 A of a heavy atom on the antibody. These
candidate epitope patches are then scored using geometric ﬁtting and a
speciﬁc antibody—antigen score. The geometric ﬁt is calculated by enu-
merating all possible contacts between the set of putative epitope residues
and the CDRs and evaluating which pairs of antibody—antigen contacts
can be satisﬁed simultaneously (see Fig. 1 for an example). The ﬁnal
epitope score for each patch is a sum of all possible contacts between
the given epitope and CDRs, weighted by the number of other contacts
they can satisfy simultaneously as well as the antibody—antigen Precision
Score for the particular amino acid contact pair. The Precision Score has
been adapted from our earlier work on local antibody—antigen docking
(Krawczyk et al., 2013). In the ﬁnal ranking of the candidate epitopes, we
only keep patches with <30% of their residues in common.

2.2.2 Enumerating epitope-like patches Our algorithm identiﬁes
plausible extended epitope-like patches on the surface of the antigen
and annotates each of them with a score indicating the likelihood of
containing the correct epitope. A putative epitope patch is created for
every surface residue on the antigen. The patch consists of the neighbor-
hood of the surface residues and is constructed by selecting every surface

residue within 4.5 A of the chosen residue. This step is followed by adding
the surface residues within 4.5 A of the current residues in the patch. See
Supplementary Section 2 for details.

2.2.3 Precision Score for the epitope prediction EpiPred uses geo-
metric matching of the antibody and antigen surfaces, which are weighted
by a speciﬁc antibody—antigen score. The antibody-speciﬁc score is the
Precision Score, which we have previously shown to be able to more
reliably identify antibody-speciﬁc docking poses (Krawczyk et al.,
2013). Here Pr(Tab, T ag) denotes the likelihood of the docking algorithm
to correctly pair a residue of type T ab on the antibody and a residue of
type T ag on the antigen (for instance, glycine on the antibody and serine
on the antigen). The Precision Score Pr(Tab, T ag) was estimated by
executing ZDOCK on each of the 118 targets in SAbDab-nr that were
not in X-test and in the set of top 200 ZDOCK-scored poses counting
how many times a given pair of residues was matched correctly with
respect to the native structures. For details of the procedure see
Supplementary Section 3.

To ensure we have not overtrained the Precision Score for the H-test
dataset, we have removed all members of the SAbDab-nr that had >90%
sequence identity with any antigen and >99% with any antibody in the
H-test. The sequence identity was calculated using CD-HIT (Li and
Godzik, 2006).

2.2.4 Scoring putative epitopes Let Epi denote the set of residues in
a putative epitope and Ab the set of residues supplied as the binding site
on the antibody. We create a graph G where each node n, corresponds to
an element of the Cartesian product of Epi and Ab: Epi X Ab. Thus, if
there was a tyrosine (SO residue in Epi and a histidine (H) residue in Ab,
there will be a node n’ in G that corresponds to this pair—( Y,H). Each of
the nodes represents a possible intermolecular contact between antibody
and antigen residues.

We add an edge between any two nodes in G if the antibody—antigen
contacts deﬁned by those nodes can be geometrically satisﬁed at the same
time. Take node m, which stands for a contact between antibody residue
rabl and antigen residue ragl and node n2 with antibody residue rabz and
antigen residue ragz. Deﬁne dist(rab1, rabz) as the intramolecular distance
between the two residues rabl and rabz. We place an edge between n1 and
n2 only if the difference in intramolecular distances on the antibody and
the antigen is below 1A as given by (1).

The choice of 1 A was motivated by our analysis of the intramolecular
distances between residues in contact. We concluded from this analysis
that 1A offers a good balance between the coverage of the binding site
and the number of residues that can satisfy this condition (Supplementary
Section 4).

ldiSt(rabls rab2) _ diSt(ragls rag2)| < 113 

Let d(n) denote the degree of node n. The ﬁnal score for a putative
epitope Epi is given by (2).

EpitopeScore(Epi, Ab) = Z d(n)Pr(Tab, T ag) (2)
neG

where T ab and T ag are the amino acid types of the antibody and antigen
residues, respectively, which belong to node n.

The epitopes are ordered by their score and the top three non-over-
lapping epitopes are kept. Overlapping epitopes are deﬁned as those that
share >30% of the same residues with respect to the epitope with the
higher epitope score.

We use our epitope prediction algorithm on each of the targets in
X—test and H-test.

2.2.5 DiscoTope 2.0 epitope predictions The structures of 30 anti-
gens in X—test were submitted to the DiscoTope 2.0 (http://www.cbs.dtu.

Fig. 1. Left: Example of a case when intramolecular distances can provide information about which intermolecular contacts can exist. The antibody—
antigen contacts between Tyr-22 and Lys-27 and Gly-56 and Lys-34 (blue dashes) can exist as the intramolecular distance between Tyr-22 and Gly-56 is
9.4A and the distance between the two Lys residues is 10.2 A. The difference between those two intramolecular distances is 0.8 A, which is below the
cutoff of 1 A. As a counterexample, the contacts between Tyr-22 and Lys-27 and Asp-102 and Lys-34 (black dashes) cannot be satisﬁed simultaneously
because the intramolecular distance between Tyr-22 and Asp-102 is 17.5 A. Right: The top epitope prediction for the antigen 1boy (human tissue factor,
the unbound form of the antigen complexed in 1ahw in H-test). The prediction consists of a set of residues, which are considered to constitute the general
area of the epitope. The true positives are shown in green, false positives in teal, false negatives in red and true negatives in dark blue. This prediction
achieved 36% precision and 94% recall. (The target comes from the dataset H-test, and thus, the antibody used in the prediction was a homology model

and the corresponding antigen was in the unbound form)

thresholds suggested by the service: —3.7, —2.5, —1.0, 0.5 and 1.1. The
residues predicted by DiscoTope as part of an epitope were compared
with the native contacts (<4.5 A from a heavy atom on the antibody). The
best results, by Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC; Matthews, 1975),
were obtained for the threshold of —3.7 and thus were used for the com-
parison with EpiPred.

2.2.6 Evaluating the performance of antibody-specificity of
EpiPred predictions We have tested the ability of EpiPred to identify
the epitopes of different antibodies on the same antigen using the test case
of lysozyme. There are ﬁve standard (non-camelid) antibody—lysozyme
complexes available in the PDB [we chose representatives: 1a2y, 1j1x,
1jhl, 1p2c and 2iff by clustering by sequence identity (99%) and removing
any with missing binding site residues or high B-factors. We randomly
select a structure from each cluster]. They bind to three distinct epitopes:
epitope I (1a2y and 1jhl), epitope II (1p2c and 2iff) and epitope III (1j1x)
(see Supplementary Section 5).

We retrained EpiPred using our original set of antibody-antigen
complexes, removing any antibody with >99% sequence identity to the
targets and all antigens with >90% sequence identity to lysozyme. We
then ran EpiPred on each of the ﬁve cases.

2.3 Global docking

The global docking pipeline we have developed is divided into three steps.
Firstly, up to three candidate epitope predictions from EpiPred are com-
puted. Secondly, we perform global docking using a fast rigid-body al-
gorithm (ZDOCK or ClusPro). We do not provide any epitope
information at this point, only supplying the CDR residues to be
masked. The ﬁnal step consists of rescoring the poses produced by the
docking algorithms using AB DockSorter.

The input to AB DockSorter consists of a single antibody—antigen
pose supplied by the docking algorithm, a set of Chothia CDR residues
and a set of residues for one of the predicted epitopes. For each pose, the
AB DockSorter score is computed for each of the top three predicted
epitopes, as given by EpiPred. The ﬁnal score of a pose is the highest of

the three scores. The poses for a given target are then reranked by this
score.

2.3.] Docking algorithms All the targets were subject to a random
rotation and translation before submission to either ZDOCK or ClusPro.
ZDOCK was run on all of the targets in the X—test set with the constraint
on the antibody of the Chothia CDRs and with no epitope information.
The software was executed using its default parameters, with the excep-
tion that the number of poses to probe was set to 10000. As it was
computationally feasible, we performed ﬁve runs of ZDOCK for each
target, using different random seeds each time. An analogous procedure
was applied to the targets in H-test. The targets in X-test and H-test were
also submitted to ClusPro in antibody mode, using automatic CDR
masking.

2.3 .2 Rescoring decoys Consider a set of decoys D returned by either
ZDOCK or ClusPro for a given target. We collect the top N decoys from
D as ordered by the docking method. For a given decoy din the set of top
N decoys from D, let Ab denote the set of residues used as the antibody
constraint and Epi a set of predicted epitope residues. Let (rub, rag) be any
pair or residues in d, where rub 6 Ab and rag e Epi. If the distance be-
tween rab and rag is observed to be <4.5A in the decoy d, this pair of
residues contributes the value of Pr(Tab, T ag) to the score for this decoy,
where T ab is the type of the amino acid type of rag, and T ag is the amino
acid type of rag. If we let dist(rab, rag) denote the distance in Angstroms
between residues rag, and rag, the score for decoy d using antibody con-
straint Ab and epitope prediction Epi can be formalized by (3).

DecoyScore(d) = Z
Fab 6 Ab
rag e Epi
dist(rab, rag) < 4.5A

Pr(Tabs Tag) 

The top N decoys for a given target are given scores using our three
epitope predictions. For each decoy, we retain the highest score of the
three. We then use those scores to reorder the top N decoys for a given
target.

Improving B-cell epitope prediction

 

In the case of ZDOCK for both X-test and H-test, we rescore the top
30 decoys for each target. We use the top 20 predictions for ClusPro, as
this is the maximum number of decoys returned in most cases.

2.3.3 Evaluation criteria for docking To evaluate the quality of each
decoy, we use the interfacial root mean square deviation (Irmsd), one of the
metrics used in the Critical Assessment of PRotein Interactions (CAPRI)
experiment (Mendez et al., 2005). The value of Irmsd is the root mean
square deviation between the interface region of the decoy and the native
structure when those regions are optimally superimposed. The interface
regions are deﬁned as those within neighborhood of 10A from any resi-
due on the binding partner.

We deﬁne a close-to-native decoy in the same way as the authors of the
ClusPro antibody study (Brenke et al., 2012). A close-to—native decoy is
deﬁned as having Irmsd <10 A from the native complex. For each target in
our test sets, we have the raw list of top N decoys as ordered by the
docking algorithm and our rescored version thereof. To evaluate which
ordering is better, we count the number of close-to-native decoys in the
ﬁrst, top ﬁve and top ten entries in the raw and rescored lists. For in-
stance, if using our rescored list we ﬁnd three close-to-native decoys in the
top ﬁve and only one in the top ﬁve decoys in the raw list, we consider the
rescoring to have improved the result. If in the top N of both lists no
close-to—native decoy is found, we state there was no suitable decoy.

Because multiple runs were performed for ZDOCK, the reported re-
sults are derived from the comparison of the averages of close-to-native
decoys in the raw and rescored lists for each target.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Epitope prediction

The epitope prediction algorithm presented here was inspired by
our earlier work on local antibody—antigen docking, where we
showed that it was possible to select close-to-native decoys when
docking the antibody into an approximate region of the epitope
(Krawczyk et al., 2013).

To extend our local docking methodology to global docking,
we have developed an epitope prediction algorithm that identiﬁes
surface patches on the antigen similar to the approximate epi-
topes used in our earlier work (see Fig. 1). Our epitope prediction
algorithm receives, as input, the structure of an antibody and an
antigen and returns a ranked list of epitope-like regions.

In our case, the aim is to generate epitope predictions speciﬁc
for a given antibody to facilitate docking. Thus, the use of anti-
body information is crucial. However, as shown later, the anti-
body structure can be a homology model.

3.1.] Evaluation of the performance of epitope prediction For
our epitope prediction method to be applicable in Virtual screen-
ing, it must be able to produce results given nothing more than
the sequence of the antibody and the structure of the antigen. To
verify this claim, we have evaluated the results of our epitope
prediction algorithm on two datasets: a crystal structure dataset
(X-test) and on homology model dataset (H-test). The ﬁrst data-
set (X—test) consisted of 30 non-redundant solved crystal struc-
tures of antibody—antigen complexes. The second dataset
(H-test) consisted of 15 antibody—antigen targets, where the anti-
body is a RosettaAntibody (Sivasubramanian et al., 2009) model
with FREAD prediction for the H3 loop (Choi and Deane, 2011,
2010) and where 10 of the 15 antigens are in the unbound form.

The crystal structure dataset, X-test, constitutes the simpler of
the two test sets, as all the structures are in their bound

conformations. The results on the crystal structure dataset
show the performance of the algorithm given close to perfect
information for both structures and, as such, serve as a contrast
to the homology dataset, H-test. The homology dataset poses the
realistic challenge, as it represents the input that might be given
to the algorithm in the course of Virtual screening. The results
from evaluating our epitope prediction algorithm on the crystal
structure dataset are presented in Table 1.

As one would expect, it is easier to obtain good predictions on
small antigens, as there are fewer candidate patches to enumer-
ate. Similarly, one would expect a considerable drop of perform-
ance on the larger antigens because the method needs to
distinguish between many more candidate patches. In cases
such as 3t3p and 3pgf, which have 453 and 358 residues, respect-
ively, no acceptable predictions were obtained. However, for 3liz,
3jr9, 3zkm and 3rl g, which have >300 residues, reasonable epi-
tope predictions were generated, suggesting that the method re-
tains a degree of predictive power even for larger antigens.

To give an indication of the background random distribution,
we have executed EpiPred on each target in the crystal structure
test set 500 times, randomizing the epitope score given to each
candidate patch. For each run, we have averaged the precision
and recall metrics of the top epitope of the 30 targets in X-test.
The mean precision and recall averaged over 500 random-score
runs on dataset X-test are 23 and 14%, respectively (the random
results for each target are in Table l). The corresponding average
values for the ﬁrst epitope prediction from Table l are 44%
recall and 14% precision. The recall is considerably higher
using our method, indicating its predictive power.
Furthermore, the score correctly identiﬁes better epitopes be-
cause the corresponding values for the second epitope are
recall 25% and precision 13% and recall 18% and precision
7% for the third epitope (see Supplementary Section 6).

We have compared the results of EpiPred with one of
the leading conformational B-cell predictors, DiscoTope 2.0
(Kringelum et al., 2012). The results presented in Table l are
the best prediction results from among the ﬁve thresholds pro-
posed on the DiscoTope Web site (see Methods Section). On
dataset X-test, EpiPred achieves better prediction results than
DiscoTope 2.0 on 17 targets, worse on eight and neither of the
methods produces a usable prediction on the remaining ﬁve. This
indicates the value of using antibody structure information in
epitope prediction.

In Supplementary Table S10, the results for epitope predic-
tions for the homology cases (H-test) are given. The average
precision and recall for the top predicted epitope are 16 and
47%, respectively. These results are similar (in fact not statistic-
ally signiﬁcantly different; see Supplementary Section 7) to those
achieved on the crystal structure set, indicating that the imprecise
structural information from homology models and unbound
antigens does not adversely affect the method.

3.1.2 Specificity of EpiPred predictions We have tested
EpiPreds capacity to distinguish between the epitopes of different
antibodies binding to the same antigen. As a test case we have
picked lysozyme and the ﬁve distinct antibodies that bind to
three different epitopes: epitope I (1a2y and 1jhl), epitope II
(2iff and 1p2c) and epitope III with ljlx (see Supplementary
Section 5).

Note: We present the top EpiPred prediction and the corresponding results for DiscoTope 2.0 using a score threshold of —3.7. The values in bold indicate the best prediction
result. Precision and recall were computed by the following formula: precision = T P/ (T P + FP), recall 2 T P/ (T P + FN) where TP stands for true positives, FP for false
positives and FN for false negatives. In each case, we also give the Matthews correlation coefﬁcient [MCC (Matthews, 1975)]. As control, the corresponding result using

randomized score is given for each target.

The results are shown in Table 2. Note that as the training set
for these predictions is larger than that used for X-test (see
Section 2), EpiPred produces a better prediction for lp2c.
EpiPred fails to predict epitope III and predicts a site that over-
laps marginally with epitope I. In the case of epitopes I and II
(which are on opposite sides of lysozyme), EpiPred correctly
identiﬁes the relevant part of the protein.

3.2 Improving global docking using epitope predictions

We have used EpiPred to constrain the results of two fast rigid-
body docking algorithms: ZDOCK and ClusPro (Brenke et al.,
2012; Chen et al., 2003). ZDOCK is not optimized for docking
antibody—antigen complexes beyond CDR masking, but as we
have shown in our earlier work, its results can be rescored to
enrich the top poses with close-to-native antibody—antigen com-
plexes (Krawczyk et al., 2013). ClusPro’s global antibody—

antigen docking mode has been shown to be currently the best
method in this area (Brenke et al., 2012).

3.2.1 Evaluating the performance of our global pipeline We have
evaluated the performance of our global docking pipeline based
on the criteria introduced in the ClusPro study (Brenke et al.,
2012). We call an antibody—antigen pose close-to-native if its
interfacial root mean square deviation (Irmsd) is <10 A. We
focus on the number of near-native poses found in the top N
predictions, as these decoys could then be passed on for further
reﬁnement by ﬂexible methods.

In Figure 2, we show how our methodology improves the
standard docking procedures, which only make use of the para-
tope information. For instance, suppose that for a target in the
top ﬁve poses as ordered by ClusPro, there are three close-to-
native decoys, and in the corresponding top ﬁve results rescored
using our pipeline, we obtain four close-to-native decoys. In such

Fig. 2. Success rates of rescoring compared with the raw decoy lists given by the docking algorithms. We show results for each docking program
(ZDOCK or ClusPro) on each test set (X—test or H-test) for top one, ﬁve and ten results. The leftmost bars are the number of times our global docking
pipeline improved results. Bars that are second to left are the corresponding number of cases when including epitope information made the results worse.
Bars that are second to right are the number of times including the epitope information did not change the raw result. The rightmost bars are the number
of cases for which both procedures reported no close-to-native decoys. See Supplementary Section 6 for the per-complex information. (A) Success rate of
ClusPro on dataset X-test. (B) Success rate of ZDOCK on dataset X-test. (C) Success rate of ClusPro on dataset H-test. (D) Success rate of ZDOCK on

a case, our global docking pipeline produced an improvement by
enriching the top results with more close-to-native decoys. If the
number of close-to—native decoys is zero in both lists, we state
that there were no suitable decoys.

As shown in Figure 2 on average, including epitope informa-
tion improves over the raw results obtained by either ZDOCK or
ClusPro. The improvement is particularly dramatic when con-
sidering the top scoring pose in the crystal structure dataset.

Our rescoring brings eight close-to-native structures to the top
position for ClusPro and nine for ZDOCK. This means that in
almost a third of the cases, the top result is a close-to-native pose
if rescored using our method.

The performance of the top prediction is not as pronounced in
the homology model dataset, as our pipeline improves only
slightly more cases than it deteriorates. The most pronounced
increase in performance here is for the top ﬁve predictions, where
we improve on 6 of the 15 cases for both ZDOCK and ClusPro.
This suggests that using our method on a dataset closely resem-
bling realistic input for virtual screening improves on the stand-
ard algorithms.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this manuscript, we have demonstrated that our antibody-
speciﬁc epitope prediction method is able to improve the
global docking of antibodies and antigens.

The method EpiPred, when structures of the antibody and the
antigen are given, annotates the likely epitope regions speciﬁc to
the supplied antibody. In that respect, EpiPred differs from other
methods such as DiscoTope or PEPITO, which annotate general
immunogenic/epitope-like regions on the antigen, without any
antibody information required on input (Kringelum et al.,
2012; Sela-Culang et al., 2013). In particular, in comparison
with DiscoTope 2.0, we demonstrate that including the antibody
information appears to be advantageous for the prediction of
antibody-speciﬁc epitopes.

We demonstrate that the top epitope predictions obtained
using our method have a considerably higher average recall
(44% recall at 14% precision) than that expected at random
(23% recall at 14% precision) on a non-redundant set of crystal
structures. We further demonstrate that EpiPred can receive
homology models on input without a negative effect on perform-
ance. Thus, it appears that EpiPred requires only the sequence of
an antibody and the structure of the antigen to produce mean-
ingful results.

We have used the epitope predictions from EpiPred to rerank
the outputs of two fast rigid-body docking algorithms and ﬁnd
that rescoring the decoys in this manner signiﬁcantly enriches the
number of close-to-native poses among the top one, ﬁve and ten
results. This result holds for targets where the antibody is a hom-
ology model and the antigen is in the unbound structure. We
have also tested our global docking pipeline on a blind test case
supplied by UCB Pharma where once again including EpiPred
predictions improved global docking results (see Supplementary
Section 8).

In conclusion, our global pipeline increases the conﬁdence that
the close-to-native decoy will be among the top ﬁve poses. This is
already a signiﬁcant reduction of the potential set of possibilities
experimentalists need to deal with when deciding on how to
adjust the antibody sequence against the antigen. A researcher
might choose to infer information by examining these or they
could further reﬁne the results using more time-consuming ﬁex-
ible docking procedures.

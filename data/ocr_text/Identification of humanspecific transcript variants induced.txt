ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many genes in the human genome produce a wide
variety of transcript variants resulting from alternative exon splicing,
differential promoter usage, or altered polyadenylation site utilization
that may function differently in human cells. Here, we present a
bioinformatics method for the systematic identification of human-
specific novel transcript variants that might have arisen after the
human—chimpanzee divergence.

Results: The procedure involved collecting genomic insertions that
are unique to the human genome when compared with orthologous
chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genomic regions, and that are
expressed in the transcriptome as exons evidenced by mRNAs
and/or expressed sequence tags (ESTs). Using this procedure, we
identified 112 transcript variants that are specific to humans; 74
were associated with known genes and the remaining transcripts
were located in unannotated genomic loci. The original source of
inserts was mostly transposable elements including L1 , Alu, SVA, and
human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs). Interestingly, some non-
repetitive genomic segments were also involved in the generation
of novel transcript variants. Insert contributions to the transcripts
included promoters, terminal exons and insertions in exons, splice
donors and acceptors and complete exon cassettes. Comparison of
personal genomes revealed that at least seven loci were polymorphic
in humans. The exaptation of human-specific genomic inserts as
novel transcript variants may have increased human gene versatility
or affected gene regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The human genome acquired many genetic modiﬁcations after the
human—chimpanzee divergence, some of which may have played a
signiﬁcant role in the evolution of human traits. The transcription
factor F 0XP2, a gene involved in human speech and language,
shows accelerated evolution in humans, and alterations within this
gene may have been responsible for changes in the transcription
of central nervous system development genes (Enard et al., 2002;
Konopka et al., 2009). The HARIF non—coding gene, expressed

during cortical development, was shown to have increased the rate
of nucleotide sequence substitution in humans (Pollard et al., 2006).
In addition, at least three human protein—coding genes have been
shown to originate from ancestrally non—coding DNA (Knowles
and McLysaght, 2009). Interestingly, loss of gene function has also
been suggested to play a role in the acquisition of human—speciﬁc
phenotypes (Olson, 1999). For example, MYHI6 and BASE were
inactivated by a frameshift mutation (Hahn and Lee, 2005; Stedman
et al., 2004); KRTHAP] and SERPINAI3 by a nonsense mutation
(Hahn and Lee, 2006; Winter at al., 2001); and CMAH, M 0XD2 and
S 100A15A by an exon deletion (Chou et al., 1998; Hahn et al., 2007).
Human—speciﬁc sequence modiﬁcations in cis—regulatory elements
that alter gene expression patterns and hence may have driven
the developmental evolution of humans have also been identiﬁed
(Noonan, 2009).

Insertion of DNA fragments into a genome plays an important
role in the shaping of the genome, including the insertion of
mobile elements such as SINEs and LINEs (Deininger et al., 2003),
retroviruses (Dewannieux et al., 2006), retrogenes (Marques et al.,
2005) and mitochondrial DNAs (Hazkani—Covo and Graur, 2007).
Most inserted DNAs accumulate sequence substitutions and are
eventually inactivated. However, some integrated genetic elements
develop interactions with proximal genes, altering the structure or
regulation of the adjacent genes. In many cases the insertion of
Alu sequences is deleterious due to strong activation of splice sites,
which disrupts host gene transcript integrity and leads to many
genetic diseases (Knebelmann et al., 1995; Mitchell et al., 1991).
This type of destructive insertion, a mechanism known as exon—
or gene—trapping, is eventually removed from the gene pool by
strong negative selection. Therefore, most Alu exons that survive
are involved in alternative splicing, allowing a substantial portion
of the transcript to encode the original functional proteins (Sorek
et al., 2002).

Exonized Alu elements can evolve to acquire protein—coding
potential, increasing protein versatility (Krull et al., 2005).
The LINE—l (L1) retrotransposon intrinsically possesses a poly—
adenylation signal and promoter activity. Ll elements inserted into
introns often break the host gene into two separate transcripts by
a mechanism called gene breaking (Wheelan et al., 2005). Alu and
L1 transposable elements have been found in many human protein—
coding genes, implying that they have played important roles in
gene evolution (Lorenc and Makalowski, 2003; Nekrutenko and Li,
2001).

In this study, we developed a bioinformatics method to
systematically identify human—speciﬁc transcript variants that might

Identification of human-specific transcript variants

 

have arisen in the human genome after the human—chimpanzee
divergence. First, we collected human—speciﬁc genomic insertions
by comparing the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genomes.
Next, we examined whether the inserts, in whole or part, were
expressed in the human transcriptome as exons. When an insert
aligned with spliced mRNA or expressed sequence tag (EST)
sequences mapped at the same locus, we concluded that the
transcript variant containing the insert was actually expressed in
human cells. Using this procedure, we identiﬁed 112 transcript
variants that are expressed uniquely in humans.

2 METHODS

2.1 Identiﬁcation of human-speciﬁc genomic inserts

We downloaded the human, chimpanzee and rhesus macaque genome
annotation databases, hg18, panTro2 and rheMac2, respectively, from the
University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser database
(http://genome.ucsc.edu/) (Rhead et al., 2010) in January 2009. We then
collected putative human—only genomic fragments by ﬁltering the top—level
alignment gaps from the database tables for human versus chimpanzee
genome alignments (hg18.netPanTro2) and for human versus rhesus
macaque genome alignments (hg18.netRheMac2). Alignment gaps that met
the following conditions were collected: (i) the human—only fragment did
not align with its orthologous chromosome from either the chimpanzee or
rhesus macaque genomes, (ii) the human unaligned (insert DNA) length was
>50 bp, (iii) the chimpanzee or rhesus macaque unaligned length was <10 bp
and (iv) the human sequence did not overlap with any duplicated regions
listed in the database table hg18.genomicSuperDups. The Y chromosome
and the mitochondrial genome were excluded. As the result, we obtained
10 447 human—speciﬁc genomic inserts.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of human-speciﬁc transcript variants

Next, we identiﬁed the human—only fragments that would be expressed as
exons in the human transcriptome by inspecting whether they overlapped
with human exonic regions of the human genome. For the human exonic
regions, we collected human genomic segments aligned with human RefSeq,
mRNA and/or EST sequences. We used the database tables, hg18.refSquli,
hg18.chrN_mrna and hg18.chrN_intronEst, where N was the chromosome
number (from 1 to 22 and X), to deduce human exonic regions. We excluded
single—exon mRNAs and single—exon ESTs to avoid possible genomic
contamination during cDNA preparation. We removed transcripts mapped
to multiple locations in the human genome because these transcripts were
likely derived from the repetitive elements or duplicated segments. We
also excluded transcripts if the whole transcriptional unit resided within
the insert because these transcripts did not interact with nearby genes.
We obtained 240 human—speciﬁc genomic insert candidates that overlapped
with human exonic regions. We then excluded candidate inserts where
the orthologous chimpanzee chromosomal region was close to a sequence
gap (within 500 bp) or exhibited low quality. For the chimpanzee genome
sequence gap and quality data, we used the database tables, panTro2.gap
and panTro2.quality, respectively. After these exclusions, we identiﬁed
209 regions as novel exonic candidates for human—speciﬁc transcript
variants.

As a ﬁnal step, we manually scrutinized the candidate regions to collect
highly probable cases of human—speciﬁc transcript variants. The genome
alignment tracks of the UCSC Genome Browser were analyzed to make sure
that the insertion was human speciﬁc. We excluded cases showing short or
poor alignment between the genome sequences or uncertain orthology for
members of multigene families between the two species. Finally, we collected
112 human—speciﬁc transcript variants.

2.3 Identiﬁcation of the insert contribution

The effects of inserts on host genes were determined based on the
contribution of the insert to the derived transcript (Supplementary Fig. $1).
The effects were categorized as follows: (i) ‘promoter’, the transcript started
within the insert and the splice donor of the ﬁrst exon was either within the
insert or a cryptic donor site was used in the nearby downstream region,
(ii) ‘terminal exon’, the transcript ended within the insert and the splice
donor of the last exon was either within the insert or a cryptic acceptor
site was used in the nearby upstream region, (iii) ‘insertion’, the insertion
occurred within a host exon and the splice donor and acceptor sites of the
exon were located on the outside of the insert, (iv) ‘splice donor’, a splice
donor was located within the insert and a cryptic splice acceptor or a cryptic
promoter was present in the nearby upstream region, (v) ‘splice acceptor’,
a splice acceptor was located within the insert and a cryptic splice donor or
a cryptic polyadenylation site was present in the nearby downstream region
and (vi) ‘exon cassette’, both splice donor and acceptor sites were located
within the insert and hence a part of the insert provided an internal exon.

2.4 Identiﬁcation of the inserts and classiﬁcation of the
transposable of elements

The original source of the insert was identiﬁed in each human variant. The
inserts were either transposable elements or unique genomic fragments.
The transposable element subfamily classiﬁcation was conducted using
RepeatMasker version open—3.2.9 (http://www.repeatmasker.org/) with the
‘—s’ option and RepBase libraries as of June 4, 2009 (Jurka, 2000). L1
elements were further classiﬁed into Ta subfamilies by manually inspecting
the diagnostic sequences (Brouha et al., 2003). BLAT searches of the human
genome assembly at the UCSC Genome Browser database were used to
identify non—repetitive genomic fragments.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of insertion/deletion polymorphisms
We analyzed some individual human genome assemblies and the NCBI
dbSNP database to check whether any of the 112 cases are polymorphic
in humans. The hg18 genome fragments spanning the inserts were extracted
and BLASTed against the personal genome contigs generated by reference—
independent (de novo) assembly, including J. Craig Venter (JCV) genome
(Levy et al., 2007), and the Chinese YH and Yoruba NA18507 genomes
(Li et al., 2010). Absence or presence of the insertion was determined (see
Supplementary Table $1 for details).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Identiﬁcation of human-speciﬁc transcript variants

The goal of this analysis was to collect human—speciﬁc transcript
variants that emerged in the human genome after the human—
chimpanzee divergence. It is possible that non—exonic segments or
insert elements existing before the human—chimpanzee divergence
could acquire a novel splice site and become part of a transcript
only in the human genome (Lev—Maor et al., 2003; Sorek et al.,
2004). A method of comparing human and non—human primate
species transcriptome data itself could be used for the discovery
of novel transcript variants generated by this route. However, this
method would be very difﬁcult because it would demand extensive
transcriptome data for non—human primates.

Instead, we focused on human—speciﬁc genomic segments that
were inserted after the human—chimpanzee divergence. When a
human—speciﬁc genomic insert was expressed as a part of the
transcriptome in the human cells, we assumed it represented a
novel human—speciﬁc transcript variant. An example case observed
in this study is given in Figure 1. We found a human—speciﬁc L1HS

indicate the corresponding segment exists only in the human genome due to a speciﬁc insertion of the L1 element. The transcription start site is located at the
5/ end of the L1 element on the antisense strand, which is often referred to as the L1 ASP.

element insertion in the CHRM3 gene locus. The RefSeq transcript
(accession number NM_000740), an mRNA (AF279779) and three
ESTs (CD654050, DA454603 and DA742231) were identiﬁed as
derived from the antisense promoter (ASP) of the inserted L1
element, indicating that the CHRM3 gene acquired a human—speciﬁc
novel promoter.

To collect human—speciﬁc genomic inserts, we analyzed the
human—chimpanzee and human—rhesus macaque genome alignment
data available at the UCSC Genome Browser database (Rhead et al.,
2010). Human genomic fragments that did not align with either the
chimpanzee or the rhesus macaque genomes were considered as
human—speciﬁc genomic inserts. By parsing the genome alignment
data with stringent conditions, we were able to collect 10 447 highly
plausible instances of human—speciﬁc genomic insertions >50 bp.
To examine whether the human—speciﬁc inserts were expressed
as transcripts in the human cell, we utilized human transcriptome
sequence data, including RefSeqs, mRNAs and ESTs. We excluded
unspliced mRNA or EST sequence data to avoid possible genomic
contamination during cDNA preparation. When a human—speciﬁc
genomic insert aligned with a transcript, it was considered a human—
speciﬁc transcript variant. After manual inspection of the candidates,

we collected 112 human—speciﬁc transcript variants. The original
source of each insert was identiﬁed, and the contribution of the
insert to the derived transcript was determined (Supplementary
Table S1).

3.2 Characteristics of human-speciﬁc transcripts

Out of the total 112 cases, 74 insertions were associated with
known genes (Supplementary Table S 1). The insert regions provided
promoters, terminal exons, inserted segments or splice sites to
the host genes, generating novel human—speciﬁc transcript variants
of the genes. The remaining 38 cases were located in as of yet
unannotated genomic loci. It has been reported that most human
chromosomal regions that were thought not to harbor protein—
coding genes were indeed actively transcribed (Johnson et al., 2005;
Wong et al., 2001). A previous report has shown that intergenic
transcripts show patterns of tissue—speciﬁc conservation of their
expression, and about half of the expression differences in tissues
between humans and chimpanzees are due to intergenic transcripts
(Khaitovich et al., 2006). Human—speciﬁc inserts in intergenic
regions may drive novel cryptic transcription or reshape pre—existing

intergenic transcripts. They may also give rise to novel functional
RNAs, such as large non—coding RNAs or serve as a molecular
source for si— or miRNAs in humans. The novel inserts may promote
antisense transcription in human genes (Conley et al., 2008). Out
of the total 112 cases identiﬁed in this study, 13 insertions were
involved in generation or modiﬁcation of antisense transcripts of
known genes, which were described elsewhere in detail (Kim and
Hahn, 2010).

The majority (104 out of 112 cases) of the original insert
sources were transposable elements or retroviruses including L1
(44 cases), Alu (32 cases), SVA (24 cases) and HERVs (4 cases)
(Supplementary Table S2). RepeatMasker classiﬁed the L1 elements
observed in this study to L1HS, L1PA2 or L1PA3 subfamilies.
Manual classiﬁcation of L1 elements into Ta subfamilies revealed
that the most abundant groups were the L1HS;Pre—Ta (ACG/G)
and L1PA2;non—Ta subfamilies. These two L1 types have been
shown to be the most common insertion sequence ampliﬁed during
the period of ape evolution (Lee et al., 2007; Mathews et al.,
2003), and are differentially present in humans and chimpanzees
(Mills et al., 2007). All Alu repeat elements observed in this
study belonged to either the AluY or AluS subfamilies, which
are known to be active in human cells (Mills et al., 2007).
SVA is a composite retrotransposon consisting of SINE—R, VNTR
and Alu—like elements (Ostertag et al., 2003). SVA elements
are hominid speciﬁc and are actively mobilized in the human
genome (Hancks et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005). All SVA
elements belong to one of four subfamilies; SVA/C, SVA/D,
SVA/E and SVA/F. These subfamilies show differential insertion
patterns between humans and chimpanzees, with SVA/D being most
differentially present (Mills et al., 2007). In this study, SVA/D
insertion elements were found to be the most abundant SVA element
that generated human—speciﬁc transcript variants. The four HERV
elements involved in novel transcript formation were classiﬁed as
HERVK, HERVK9 or HERVH. There is published evidence that
HERVs can mobilize in the human genome, especially HERVK
(Mills et al., 2007).

We also found eight cases involved with non—repetitive genomic
DNAs; three cases of the direct mobilization of non—genic
(intron or intergenic) genomic segments, three cases of processed
cDNA integration or retrogenes probably by exploiting LINE
retrotransposition machinery, and two cases of tandem duplication
caused by DNA replication slippage.

We determined the insert contribution to the derived transcripts
on the basis of whether the insert contained a transcription start site,
polyadenylation site or splice site (Table 1). The insert provided a

promoter in 52 cases, a terminal exon in 31, an insertion in 15, a
splice donor in 9, a splice acceptor in 4 and an exon cassette in 1.

3.3 Novel promoters

We identiﬁed 52 cases in which the insert may be responsible for
driving transcription of the proximal genomic region (Table 1). Of
them, 37 insertion events provided novel promoters for the annotated
human genes. We assumed the insert to have promoter activity when
the 5’ end of the transcript was positioned within the insert. We did
not rule out the possibility that the cDNA product could be simply
truncated in the insert. Most of the new promoters were involved
with L1 elements; 35 cases were identiﬁed in this study. Some
SVA and Alu elements were also identiﬁed to promote transcription.
There is evidence in the literature that an Alu element can induce
transcription of an adjacent protein—coding gene. For example, the
ﬁrst exon of a p75TNFR gene transcript variant was derived from
an AluJo element (Singer et al., 2004).

Some of the human—speciﬁc transcript variants identiﬁed in this
study were assigned NCBI RefSeq transcripts: NM_000740, the
only RefSeq record of CHRM3 ; NR_002140, a non—coding transcript
of 0R6W1 P; and NM_001024647, one of ﬁve RefSeqs of the
RAB3IP gene. The CHRM3 gene was previously reported as an
example of a L1 ASP—promoted transcription of cellular genes
and the gene—breaking model (Speek, 2001; Wheelan et al., 2005)
although the L1 does not actually break the coding region of the
CHRM3 gene. The entire protein—coding region of CHRM3 is in the
last exon, and hence the L1—derived transcripts produce full—length
proteins. Acquisition of a human— speciﬁc promoter may increase the
expression level of full—length CHRM3 in human cells. In the case of
RAB3IP, the human—speciﬁc transcript originated from the ASP of a
L1 element integrated in an intron, which is an excellent example of
the gene—breaking model (Supplementary Fig. 2A) (Wheelan et al.,
2005). Other cases that complied with the gene—breaking model
identiﬁed in this study included CD96 and NRXN3.

It is known that L1 elements drive transcription of adjacent
cellular genes when the L1 element is inserted into the 5’ upstream
region of the gene (Speek, 2001). Transcripts starting from the L1
element could splice to the ﬁrst or second exon of the host gene and
would encode almost or fully functional full—length proteins. This
is in contrast to the gene—breaking model in which L1 integration
occurs within an intron and the novel downstream products usually
lack a large portion of the host protein N—terminus. Notable cases
of gaining new 5’ upstream promoters include CHRM3, MAL2,
TIGIT and RGS6 genes. The human—speciﬁc transcript variants
of the MAL2 and RGS6 genes were derived from the ASP of
the L1 elements. Interestingly, the novel TIGIT gene transcript
variant was derived from the L1PA3;non—Ta element sense strand
(Supplementary Fig. 2B). A splice donor in the 5’ untranslated region
(UTR) of the L1 element was used to splice to the second exon of
the TIGIT gene. The derived transcript would encode an almost
full—length protein using a methionine codon in the second exon as
a translation start codon.

We also found 12 cases where SVA elements appeared to drive
transcription. An SVA element integrated in the 5’ upstream region
provided a novel promoter for the TBPL2 gene (Supplementary
Fig. 2C). In the WDR66 gene, the SVA/D element inserted in
intron 19 seemed to promote the transcription of a human—speciﬁc

transcript variant that spliced to the last three exons of the WDR66
gene.

3.4 Novel polyadenylation sites

We identiﬁed a total of 31 cases in which the newly inserted DNA
introduced a polyadenylation site (Table 1). The splice donor site
for the new terminal exon could be either within the insert or in the
nearby upstream region possibly activated upon insertion. When the
newly inserted polyadenylation site was very close to the upstream
exon and induced premature cleavage of the transcript, the upstream
exon splice donor would not be functional, retaining the following
intronic segment. If the insert were situated in an intron, it would
induce premature termination of host gene transcription, which is
known as exon— or gene—trapping. Most of the mobile elements,
including L1, Alu and SVA are known to cause exon—trapping (Chen
et al., 2009; Hancks et al., 2009; Wheelan et al., 2005).

The LEPR gene, which encodes the leptin receptor protein,
contains a human—speciﬁc SVA element which serves as a terminal
exon, encoding a variant with a different C—terminus (Damert
et al., 2004). We successfully identiﬁed this human—speciﬁc LEPR
transcript variant in this study. The novel ATPQB gene transcript
variant terminates within the L1HS element situated in intron 4
(Supplementary Fig. 3A). The L1 contains a splice acceptor site and
a polyadenylation site, truncating the full—length ATPQB transcript
by exon—trapping. Interestingly, the L1 element sense strand was
incorporated into the transcript in contrast to the gene—breaking
model where the polyadenylation site of the L1 element antisense
strand was used (Wheelan et al., 2005). In the case of the F UT8
gene, the human—speciﬁc Alu in an intron shortened the transcript,
a typical example of Alu—induced exon—trapping (Supplementary
Fig. 3B).

Alu elements inserted in the 3’ ﬂanking region close to
a gene, as in the RAB3B and KIAAOI 01 genes, appear to
provide a novel polyadenylation site and extend the 3’ UTR
of the host gene. The RefSeq transcript NM_014736 of the
KIAAOIO] gene terminates within the human—speciﬁc Alqu8
element (Supplementary Fig. 3C). However, inspection of many
mRNAs and ESTs of the gene revealed that there is an upstream
polyadenylation site before the Alu. Most of the transcripts appear
to use the upstream signal and only a small portion of the transcripts
end within the Alu insert. It is likely that the extended read—through
transcripts miss the original polyadenylation signal and use the
alternative Alu polyadenylation signal instead.

3.5 Insertions within exons

Insertion within an exon results in a permanent change in the
structure of the host gene (Knebelmann et al., 1995; Makalowski
et al., 1994; Mitchell et al., 1991). We identiﬁed 15 cases where the
insert was situated within a host gene exon. Most of the insertions in
annotated genes were found in the 3’ UTR. Examples include an Alu
insertion in the RAB21, KIAA0319L, UTPI IL, LRRC58, SLCI3A],
GNBS and DSG3 genes, and L1 in the OPHN] gene.

The RABZ] gene case is notable in that the Alu insertion
occurred within a highly conserved segment (Fig. 2). Although
the region is untranslated, the nucleotide sequences were highly
conserved in tetrapods, including chicken (Gallus gallus), lizard
(Anolis carolinensis) and frog (Xenopus tropicalis). Alteration
of the 3’ UTR sequence and structure have been implicated in

human cancers, disease and distinct phenotypes (Abelson et al.,
2005; Mayr and Bartel, 2009). The evolutionarily conserved
regions in the 3’ UTRs may harbor regulatory elements crucial
for mRNA molecular function. Those regions may harbor post—
transcriptionalregulatory elements, which interact with trans—acting
factors including miRNAs or RNA—binding proteins. The RAB21
protein is reported to control integrin trafﬁcking, which is necessary
for cell cytokinesis (Pellinen et al., 2008). Alu disruption of the
conserved RABZI 3’ UTR may have altered the post—transcriptional
regulation of the human RABZ] gene.

Human—speciﬁc disruption of conserved 3’ UTR elements by
insertion would substantially modify regulation of mRNAs in
the human cell. Altered mRNA regulation such as turnover
rate, degradation or translatability may change the abundance of
encoded proteins and subsequently develop novel human—speciﬁc
phenotypes.

3.6 Novel splice donor and/0r acceptor sites

A newly inserted segment could bring a splice acceptor and/ or donor
site within the insert. We identiﬁed 14 cases where a splice donor
site (9 cases), a splice acceptor site (4 cases) or both (1 case) was
positioned within the insert (Table 1). For example, the novel human—
speciﬁc transcript variants of the TRIM60 and ALOX5 genes utilized
a splice donor site in the newly inserted Alu and SVA elements,
respectively.

It is common for an Alu element to introduce a splice acceptor
site to the host gene transcript (Lev—Maor et al., 2003). An example
identiﬁed in this study was the COPS7B gene. A splice acceptor
site within the Alu element and a cryptic donor site in the nearby
downstream region were utilized to add an exon cassette to the
COPS7B gene; 10 ESTs contain an Alu—derived exon. The Alu exon
carries multiple inframe stop codons, so the novel transcript variant
cannot encode a full—length COPS7B protein. Transcripts containing
a premature stop codon (PTC) would be subject to nonsense—
mediated mRNA decay (Brogna and Wen, 2009), minimizing the
production of truncated proteins. Since a portion of the COPS7B
transcripts would contain the PTC—containing Alu exon, the net
effect would be a reduction of full—length COPS7B protein in the cell.

We identiﬁed an intriguing case of exon—trapping in which a
mobile element was not used; instead, genomic DNA was involved.
There is a human—speciﬁc insert in an intron of the TBCID8B gene
on X chromosome; the splice acceptor is within the insert and
the shorter TBCID8B (NM_198881) variant ends in the proximal
downstream region of the insert (Fig. 3). Interestingly, the insert
matched a portion of intron 6 of the EBFI gene on chromosome
5 in the reverse direction. The insert showed typical features for
retrotransposition; a poly(A) tract and a direct repeat caused by target
site duplication. Therefore, it is very likely that a reverse—transcribed
product of a portion of the primary EBFI transcript was integrated
into the TBC1D8B intron by exploiting LINE retrotransposition
machinery.

3.7 Insertion/deletion polymorphisms

Analysis of individual human genome assemblies, including a
Caucasian (JCV), an Asian (YH) and an African (NA18507)
genome, and the NCBI dbSNP database revealed that at
least seven loci out of 112 are polymorphic among humans
(Supplementary Table S 1). Six of these were known polymorphisms

Fig. 2. Alu insertion in the conserved RABZI gene 3’ UTR. (A) The top line shows the full genomic structure of the human RABZI gene. The human—speciﬁc
AluY element is marked in grey. (B) The genomic region surrounding the Alu insertion (an arrow) is depicted. The line labeled ‘RAB21’ indicates the
RefSeq NM_014999; the thin, thick, and half thick lines represent the intron, coding exon, and 3’ UTR, respectively. The tracks labeled ‘Multiz Alignments
of 44 Vertebrates’ show sequence conservation in tetrapod species. (C) Multiple sequence alignment of the genomic region surrounding the Alu element
is shown. Note the high 3’ UTR sequence conservation, even in non—mammalian species including chicken, lizard, and X_tropicalis (Xenopus tropicalis).
The Alu element identiﬁed by RepeatMasker program is in lowercase. The putative target site duplication is marked with dots. Genome sequences were
retrieved from the UCSC Genome Browser database and the assembly versions are hg18 (human), panTro2 (chimpanzee), rheMac2 (rhesus macaque),
mm9 (mouse), canFam2 (dog), bosTau4 (cow), monDom5 (opossum), ornAnal (platypus), galGal3 (chicken), anoCarl (lizard), and xenTro2 (Xenopus,
X. tropicalis). The multiple sequence alignment was generated using MUSCLE (http://www.d1ive5.com/muscle/) and decorated by using BOXSHADE

recorded in dbSNP. For example, the L1HS;Pre—Ta (ACG/G)
element insertion at position 132946863—132952889 on
chromosome 5 of h18 genome is absent in YH and NA18507
genomes (dbSNP accession number rs66911382). These
polymorphisms may potentially contribute to transcriptome
and phenotypic diversity among humans.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this analysis, we identiﬁed 112 cases in which human—speciﬁc
genomic inserts mediated gene evolution in the human genome.

The human—speciﬁc inserts gave rise to novel promoters,
polyadenylation sites, insert segments and splice sites. Novel
promoters generated intergenic transcripts or drove transcription
of adjacent cellular genes. Novel polyadenylation sites and splice
sites induced exon—trapping or insertion of exon cassettes. The
new transcript variants may produce proteins with different N—
or C—termini. Generation of prematurely terminated variants could
lead to decreases in abundance of full—length functional proteins.
Insertions within exons could disrupt evolutionarily conserved
elements, resulting in substantial changes in the regulation of the
genes involved. An altered cellular level of functional proteins

Fig. 3. A novel T BCID8B gene terminal exon. (A) The last exon of RefSeq NM_198881 contains a part of the EBFI gene intron on chromosome 5, which
was retrotransposed to an intron of the T BCI D8B gene. A splice acceptor is positioned within the insert and a cryptic polyadenylation signal in the downstream
region. (B) A multiple sequence alignment of the nucleotide sequences surrounding the human—speciﬁc insert from human, chimpanzee, orangutan, and rhesus
macaque genomes, is shown. Sequences derived from the EBFI gene intron are underlined. The target site duplication is indicated with dots. Note the poly(T)
sequence, which is the poly(A) tail of the insert in the reverse direction. The novel splice acceptor site (AG), two putative polyadenylation signals (AATAAA),
and polyadenylation site for the T BCID8B transcript NM_198881 are marked by two asterisks, six asterisks, and an upside down triangle, respectively.
Genome sequences were obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser database: hg18 (human), panTro2 (chimpanzee), ponAbe2 (orangutan) and rheMac2

that a substantial portion of these human—speciﬁc modiﬁcations
may be directly associated with the development of various human
characteristics. Functional investigation of these human—speciﬁc
transcripts may provide clues as to how humans acquired certain
traits after divergence from the rest of the hominoids.

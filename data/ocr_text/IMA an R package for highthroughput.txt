1 INTRODUCTION

As a major epigenetic modiﬁcation, DNA methylation plays a
Vital role in transcriptional regulation and chromatin remodeling.
The aberration of DNA methylation proﬁle has been found
to be associated with many human diseases including cancer
(Jones and Baylin, 2007; Portela and Esteller, 2010). Use of
DNA methylation microarray is a popular approach in studies to
characterize the epigenetic landscape of human cells (Laird, 2010).
Two widely used commercial platforms to perform methylation
proﬁling are the GoldenGate Methylation Beadarray and Inﬁnium
HumanMethylation27 BeadChip provided by Illumina Inc. These
two arrays quantitatively target 1505 CpG loci covering ~800 genes
and 27 578 CpG sites targeting ~14 000 genes, respectively. Since
their release, many analytic methods have been developed to process
and analyze the Illumina DNA methylation array data [for a recent
summary, see Siegmund (2011)].

Compared with previously released Illumina DNA methylation
platforms, the recently launched Inﬁnium HumanMethylation450
BeadChip represents a signiﬁcant increase in the CpG site density
for quantifying methylation events. At the gene level, the 450K
microarray covers 99% of RefSeq genes with multiple sites in the
annotated promoter (1500 bp or 200 bp upstream of transcription

start site), 5’-UTR, ﬁrst exon, gene body and 3’-UTR. From the
CpG context, it covers 96% of CpG islands with multiple sites in the
annotated CpG Islands, shores (regions ﬂanking island) and shelves
(regions ﬂanking shores) (Bibikova et al., 2011). While the role of
DNA methylation in promoter and/0r CpG island regions is long
been appreciated, the importance of DNA methylation in gene body
or shore regions for transcription regulation and tumor initialization
has recently come to attention (Irizarry et al., 2009; Maunakea
et al., 2010). The signiﬁcantly increased coverage makes 450K
microarray a powerful platform for exploring methylation proﬁle in
these annotated regions. As each targeted region contains at least one
CpG site, treating the region as a unit in the differential methylation
analysis might help identify regions with consistently coordinate
methylation changes. From a statistical point of View, region-
based differential methylation analysis will reduce the burden of
multiple comparisons and increase the power to catch differentially
methylated regions associated with the phenotypes of interest. To
this end, we have developed a pipeline, IMA, for automatic site-level
and region-level methylation analysis using the 450K microarray.
While the pipeline is primarily designed as an automatic tool for
exploratory analysis and summarization, it is ﬂexible for users to
tailor within R statistical computing and graphics environment for
their speciﬁc needs.

2 DESCRIPTIONS

IMA is implemented in R and can be run on any platform with
an existing R and Bioconductor installation. The user can run
the pipeline with default settings or specify optional routes in the
parameter ﬁle. An overview of the IMA pipeline is provided below:

Preprocessing: IMA takes as input the ,8 values representing
the methylation levels of individual sites reported by Illumina
BeadStudio or GenomeStudio software. It allows user to choose
several ﬁltering steps or modify ﬁltering criteria for speciﬁc quality
control purposes. By default, IMA will ﬁlter out loci with missing
,8 value, from the X chromosome or with median detection P > 0.05.
As probe containing SNP(s) at/near the targeted CpG site might
not be sufﬁcient to measure DNA methylation level (but rather
genomic variation), users can choose to ﬁlter out the loci whose
methylation levels are measured by probes containing SNP(s) at/near
the targeted CpG site. The option for sample level quality control
is also provided (Christensen et al., 2011). Although the raw
,8 values will be analyzed as recommended by Illumina, the user

can choose Arcsine square root transformation when modeling the
methylation level as the response in a linear model (Marsit et al.,
2011; Rocke, 1993). Logit transformation is also available as an
option (Kuan et al., 2010). The default setting of IMA is that
no normalization will be performed, and quantile normalization
is available as an alternative preprocessing option. It has been
shown that quantile normalization is not sufﬁcient for removing
all the unwanted technical variation across samples (Teschendorff
et al., 2009). The development of normalization strategy for DNA
methylation study is an active area of ongoing research (Aryee et al.,
2011).

Methylation index calculation: the promoter, 5’-UTR, ﬁrst exon,
gene body and 3’-UTR are gene-based regions. The CpG island and
its surrounding shore and shelve regions are not necessary gene-
based, depending on their distance to the nearest genes. For each
speciﬁc region (e. g. ﬁrst exon), IMA will collect the loci within it
and derive an index of overall region methylation value. Currently,
there are three different index metrics implemented in IMA: mean,
median and Tukey’s Biweight robust average. By default, the median
,8 value will be used as the region’s methylation index for further
analysis.

Diﬁ‘erential methylation analysis: for each speciﬁc region,
Wilcoxon rank-sum test (default), Student’s t-test and empirical
Bayes statistics are available for inference in differential testing.
General linear models are available as an option to infer methylation
change associated with continuous covariate (e.g. age), as well as to
adjust confounding factors (e. g. batch). A variety of multiple testing
correction algorithms are available, including stringent Bonferroni
correction and widely used false discovery rate control. Users
can specify the signiﬁcance criteria in the parameter ﬁle. The
same statistical inference and multiple test correction procedures
described above can also be applied to each single site to obtain
site-level differential methylation inference.

Output: detailed output ﬁles are provided for each of the three
modules above. For the preprocessing module, the output contains
a matrix of methylation value for qualiﬁed loci across qualiﬁed
samples. For the methylation index calculation module, there
is a matrix of methylation index across the samples for each
region category of interest (e. g. South Shore). For the differential
methylation analysis module, the differential methylation values
(e. g. delta ,8) together with both raw and adjusted P-Values of each
region (or site) of interest will be provided.

3 DISCUSSION

The major differences between IMA and existing R packages for
Inﬁnium methylation analysis (e.g. Du et al., 2008) are that IMA
provides a pipeline, which automates the tasks commonly required
for the exploratory analysis and summarization of 450K DNA
methylation data at both site-level and region-level. The package
makes use of Illumina methylation annotation for region deﬁnition,
as well as several Bioconductor packages for various preprocessing
and differential testing steps (Gentleman et al., 2004).

Instead of providing recommendations about which speciﬁc
analysis method should be used, the main purpose of developing
the IMA package is to provide a range of commonly used DNA
methylation microarray analysis options for users to choose for
their exploratory analysis and summarization in an automatic way.

Written in open-source R environment, it provides the ﬂexibility
for users to adopt, extend and customize the functionality for their
speciﬁc needs. It can be used as an automatic pipeline of methylation
level index and differential analysis for downstream functional
exploration and hypothesis generation. For example, the matrix
of methylation index for shore regions produced by IMA can be
used as the input for model-based clustering (Houseman et al.,
2008) to identify clustered shores associated with the phenotype
of interest.

Analytic methods for DNA methylation microarray analysis are
still under rapid developments (Laird, 2010; Siegmund, 2011).
Future development of IMA package will include the extension
of its functionality by incorporating the latest preprocessing and
differential analysis methods. For example, options will be added to
ﬁlter out defective bead types (e. g. mismatched or non-uniquely
aligned probes) detected from systematic re-annotation efforts
(Barbosa—Morais et al., 2010).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Mass spectrometry (MS)-based high-throughput quanti-
tative proteomics shows great potential in large-scale clinical bio-
marker studies, identifying and quantifying thousands of proteins in
biological samples. However, there are unique challenges in analyzing
the quantitative proteomics data. One issue is that the quantification of
a given peptide is often missing in a subset of the experiments, espe-
cially for less abundant peptides. Another issue is that different MS
experiments of the same study have significantly varying numbers of
peptides quantified, which can result in more missing peptide abun-
dances in an experiment that has a smaller total number of quantified
peptides. To detect as many biomarker proteins as possible, it is
necessary to develop bioinformatics methods that appropriately
handle these challenges.

Results: We propose a Significance Analysis for Large-scale
Proteomics Studies (SALPS) that handles missing peptide intensity
values caused by the two mechanisms mentioned above. Our
model has a robust performance in both simulated data and prote-
omics data from a large clinical study. Because varying patients’
sample qualities and deviating instrument performances are not avoid-
able for clinical studies performed over the course of several years, we
believe that our approach will be useful to analyze large-scale clinical
proteomics data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mass spectrometry (MS) in large-scale clinical studies provides
new insights into how disease affects our bodies at the molecular
level (Altelaar et al., 2013; Paczesny et al., 2010), identifying
and quantifying thousands of proteins in patients’ samples.
Even though MS is a powerful tool in biomedical research, it
is subject to white noise, chemical noise and stochastic variation,
needing robust and sophisticated bioinformatics algorithms

(Nesvizhskii, 2010; Ryu, 2014). One of the challenges in analyz-
ing MS data is the absence of peptide abundance in a subset of
the measurements. Peptides are often not observed because of
their low intensities. And this intensity-dependent missing trend
can introduce bias into downstream analyses when it is ignored.
Wang et al. (2006) suggested a normalization procedure using the
top-L ordered statistics of peptide intensities in each sample (L is
a user-defined threshold) and proposed an imputation approach.
Karpievitch et al. (2009) modeled the random missing mechan-
ism and the peptide intensity-dependent missing mechanism
assuming that instrument detection thresholds vary from one
peptide to the other. Wang et al. (2012) carried out an inten-
sity-based analysis and a presence/absence analysis separately
and controlled their false discovery rates. In Wang et al.
(2012), they argued that logistic regressions were not adequate
to analyze presence/absence data when all intensity values were
missing for one group. However, it is not a problem of the 10-
gistic regression, but rather a problem of the test statistics in the
logistic regression. In the situation when all or almost all peptide
abundances are missing, Wald tests overestimate P—values of the
signiﬁcant tests, but log-likelihood ratio tests do work reliably
(Hauck and Donner, 1977). Thus, using a mixture model ap-
proach with proper test statistics instead of fitting two models
separately may be better.

Another challenge in the MS data analysis is that experiments
sometimes have different total numbers of quantified peptides.
This phenomenon is often observed in MS studies Wang et al.,
2006) and is inevitable for large-scale clinical studies because the
studies are often performed over the course of several years. The
quality of patient samples varies because of their different stor-
age time and the performance of the instrument(s) changes due
to the tuning of the MS instruments or the degradation of the
liquid chromatography (LC) columns over time. Varying total
numbers of quantiﬁed peptides result in unequal numbers of
missing peptide values across experiments. An experiment with
a smaller total number of quantified peptides has more missing
peptide abundances. For example, let us assume that Experiment
A produced 4000 quantified peptides and Experiment B pro-
duced only 2000 quantified peptides because the quality of bio-
logical sample B was not as good as A. Then, Experiment B has
2000 missing peptide intensities compared with Experiment A.
Now, to investigate this missing mechanism further, assume that
one peptide named X is present in Experiment A, but absent in

Experiment B. Another peptide named Y is present in both
experiments. The reason why peptide X is absent in
Experiment B but present in Experiment A can be one of the
following: (i) peptide X is less abundant in Experiment B than in
Experiment A (intensity-dependent missing mechanism); (ii) pep-
tide X is not abundant enough to be in the top 2000 quantiﬁed
peptides (total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing mechanism); or
(iii) peptide X is missing at random. Here, the total quantiﬁca-
tion-dependent missing mechanism should not be confused with
the intensity-based missing mechanism. The total quantiﬁcation-
dependent missing mechanism implies that peptide X may be less
abundant than peptide Y that is listed in the top 2000 quantiﬁed
peptides of Experiment B. However, such missing values are not
informative because we are not comparing peptide X with pep-
tide Y (at least not in this article), but comparing the abundances
of the peptide X between the Experiment A and B. Thus, it
would introduce bias if we blindly use the censored approach
proposed previously, assuming the missing values are caused
by the lower abundance of peptide X in Experiment B compared
with Experiment A. Karpievitch et al. (2009) and Wang et al.
(2012) did not deal with the issue of total quantiﬁcation-
dependent missing values.

Figure 1 demonstrates a peptide expression proﬁle with the
intensity-dependent missing values and the total quantiﬁcation-
dependent missing values. A colored cell represents observed
peptide abundance, while a white cell represents missing peptide
abundance. Two different colors—blue and red—represent two
sample groups (i.e. controls versus patients). The missing values
in part A of Figure 1 are only from the intensity-dependent
missing mechanism. The missing values in part B result from
both the intensity- and total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing
mechanisms. Because the missing values resulting from the vary-
ing total quantiﬁcation are not informative, one way to deal with
these missing values is to remove them.

In this article, we propose a Signiﬁcance Analysis for Large-
scale Proteomics Studies (SALPS) that ﬁlters the total-
quantiﬁcation-dependent missing values and makes use of the
intensity-dependent missing values. Using simulated data, we
show how SALPS performs with the missing values generated
from the two mechanisms. Finally, we demonstrate our model
performance using proteomics data of human blood monocytes
in a large-scale clinical study of trauma patients.

2 METHOD
2.1 Deﬁnitions

Here we deﬁne the terms frequently used in this article. A peptide is a
short chain of amino acids or a substring of a protein; thus, multiple
peptide sequences observed in an experiment can come from the same
protein. In a typical high-throughput proteomics study, the levels of the
peptides are quantiﬁed by the peak intensities in the LC-MS spectra.
Because one peptide eluted over time, the peptide intensity was a sum
of peak intensities of multiple LC/MS spectra. A quantiﬁed peptide was a
peptide with non-zero peptide intensity in a given experiment. One pep-
tide with the same sequence could have multiple charge states (i.e. 2, 3 or
4). One could either combine all charge states of the same peptide and use
it as one peptide intensity or treat the peptide with different charge states
as different peptides and used them as separate peptide intensities. In our
data analysis, we used the latter approach.

Peptides

 

 

Fig. 1. An example of the peptide experiment proﬁle measured in a MS
proteomics study. The rows and columns of this proﬁle represent peptides
and experiments, respectively. Different colors imply different groups (i.e.
control versus patients). A colored cell represents the abundance of a
peptide observed, while a white cell represents a missing observation of
peptide abundance. The missing values in part A are only from the in-
tensity-dependent missing mechanism, and in part B from both the in-
tensity- and total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing mechanisms

2.2 Signiﬁcance Analysis for Large-scale Proteomics
Studies

CenSOred regression with ﬁltering This section describes how we
used intensity-dependent missing values using a censored regression and
how we ﬁltered quantiﬁcation-dependent missing values. Our censored
regression was a mixture of two models: a probit regression that modeled
presences/absences of peptide intensities and a linear regression that mod-
eled peptide intensities. For each protein, a censored regression was con-
structed as the following:

M+Pi+Gj+6iﬂ ifmiﬂ=0,
yijl{

0 ifmiﬂ=l,

6U1~N(0a 02), 

mUZ~Bern0ulli(p,-j)
Pi; = (1301/ + P:- + GJ’),

where 1': l, ..., m was the index of a peptide, j = l, 2 was the index of a
group and I: l, ..., nj was the index of a biological replicate within a
group. yiJ-l represented a log-transformed intensity of peptide 1' measured
in biological replicate l of study group j. Jim was positive when mm = 0. 02
represented the variance of )2 given covariates. miJ-l represented an indica-
tor variable—whether a peptide quantiﬁcation was absent (=1) or not
(=0). pij was a probability of missing peptide quantiﬁcation. (I) was the
standard cumulative normal distribution. 11/ estimated a proportion of
peptide intensities that were absent at random. We also adjusted the
differences in the intensity values and missing rates between peptides by
adding Pi and  terms. It was known that even though peptides from the
same protein had the same abundance in a biological sample, their peak

Differential protein expression

 

intensities and missing rates varied because of their different ionization
efﬁciencies and detectibilities (Tang et al., 2006). Thus, it was necessary to
adjust these differences.

Equation (1) contained peptide terms and group terms for both the
linear regression part and the probit regression part. Here, we let ,Bg = G2
—G1 and yg= G’2 — G’1 for a convenience. Then, a positive value of ,Bg
implied that a protein of interest was more abundant in Group 2 com-
pared with Group 1. A negative value of yg implied that the protein had
less missing values in Group 2 compared with Group 1. Thus, ,Bg and yg
had opposite signs in the ideal case.

Before constructing the ﬁnal censored regressions and testing for the
differential proteins, we removed the total quantiﬁcation-dependent miss-
ing values by determining the ﬁltering threshold such that high propor-
tions of ,Bg and yg had opposite signs. Graphically, it attempted to
remove the vertical white spaces in part B in Figure 1. First, we obtained
a median value of observed intensities from all experiments for each
peptide. According to these median peptide intensities, we assigned
ranks to the peptides in a descending order. Then, we let kn be a ratio
between the rank of peptide 1' and the total number of quantiﬁed peptides
in Experiment I. For instance, if peptide iwas ranked in 2000” place and
Experiment I had 1000 quantiﬁed peptides, then its k value would be
2(= 3%). Next, we ﬁt the model (1) after ﬁltering the missing values
with various thresholds of k scores. (We expressed the threshold of k’s
as kth.) We measured the percentage of ,Bg and yg having opposite signs
with various kth values in {1, 1.5, 2, 2.5, . . .}. Then, we chose the kth that
produced the largest percentage of ,Bg yg < 0 and ﬁltered all missing values
with their k values greater than kth.

After ﬁltering the total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing values, we
were left with the intensity-dependent missing values and constructed
the ﬁnal model (1). The likelihood of this model was the following:

L= H [(1 —p.-,-)a¢<a(y.-,-z — vanl—mwipijimiu (2)
ijl
where 1),; = p. + P,- + Gj.

Maximum likelihood estimates of parameters were same as the linear
regression and probit regression. Thus, we estimated these parameters
using a standard package of linear regression and probit regression
in R. This model reduced to a probit regression when all peptide intensity
values in one group were missing, while it reduced to a linear regression
when all peptides intensity values were present. This model was similar
to a lognorrnal Hurdle regression commonly used in economics
(Wooldridge, 2010).

Hypothesis testings We used a bootstrap approach to detect proteins
whose abundances or missing rates were different between Group 1 and
2. The null hypothesis of interest was H0 : G1 = G2 = G’1 = G’2 = 0. We let
our test statistics —2)» = — 2(log(L0) — log(L)) where L0 was a likelihood
for the model without group terms for both linear regression and logistic
regression parts. Then, we constructed a null distribution of —2)» by
perrnuting subject group labels and estimated P—values based on the
null distribution. To correct multiple testing errors, q-values were com-
puted for each protein using Storey (2002). An alternative way to estimate
P—values is to use the likelihood-ratio test assuming that —2)» under the
null has chi-square distribution. However, the bootstrap gave more ac-
curate q-values than likelihood ratio tests (See Supplementary Materials),
and thus, we used the bootstrap approach to test H0.

As mentioned previously, for detected differential proteins with small
q-values, it is ideal to have ,Bg yg < 0. But, we can sometimes have proteins
with ,Bg yg > 0. In other words, in the ideal situation, if the peptides from
Protein X were more abundant in Group 2 than 1, then the intensities of
these peptides were supposed to be more frequently present in Group 2.
However, sometimes, these peptides can appear less frequently in
Group 2, but the difference in these frequencies between two groups
was not signiﬁcant. This would be more evident when yg was close to
zero. For example, in the situation when Protein X was actually more

abundant in Group 2 than 1, two of 100 peptides intensities were missing
for Group 2, and one of 100 peptides intensities was missing for Group 1.
Then, Group 1 had smaller missing rate for Protein X, but the difference
in the missing rates between two groups was negligible.

Thus, we further tested two null hypotheses, HOG : G1=G2 =0 and
HOG, : G’1=G’2=0 noting that ,Bg=G2 — G1 =0 and yg=G’2 — G’1 =0.
We restricted these tests to the differential proteins with q-values <q,;,
(i.e. qth = 0.01) and with ,Bgyg>0. Because it was not plausible to use
bootstrap for these tests, we used likelihood ratio tests. By taking a sign
of either ,Bg or yg (not both) with a smaller P—value, we determined
whether a protein of interest is more or less abundant in Group 1 than 2.

2.3 Datasets

Simulated data We generated several simulated datasets that were
aimed to reﬂect real MS data. The different simulated datasets contained
various proportions of total quantiﬁcation— and intensity-dependent miss-
ing values. Details of simulation procedures and parameters were shown
in the Supplementary Materials. In brief, peptide intensities were gener-
ated from the linear regression part of (1). Concerning the missing mech-
anisms, we had three parameters of interest, 11, $2 and b. 11 represented
the magnitude of association between mean peptide intensities and miss-
ing rates (11 e (0, 1]). A larger 11 indicated a stronger association between
peptide intensities and peptide missing rates in the data. 12 ranged in (0,1]
and represented the magnitude of association between k values and miss-
ing rates. The values of b were the probabilities that missing values were
generated from the total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing mechanism.
A higher b value would produce a larger portion of part B in Figure 1.

M onocyte proteomics data of trauma patients The data were gen-
erated by the National Institutes of Health large-scale collaborative pro-
gram, Inﬂammation and Host Response to Injury Consortium. The study
was reviewed and approved by the institutional review boards at each
participating site. Blood monocyte samples of 147 trauma patients were
collected within 12 h after the injury. Among 141 patients, 77 patients had
complicated recovery and 64 patients had uncomplicated recovery (Xiao
et al., 2011). Our interest was to ﬁnd the proteins whose abundances were
different between these two recovery groups.

Samples were prepared using 18O-labeled universal reference-based ap-
proach described in Qian et al. (2010) and analyzed by MS. Each experi-
ment contained peptides from a pool sample and from an individual
patient sample. Peptides from the pool sample were labeled with 18O
and used as universal standards. (We will call peptides from the pool
sample as heavy-labeled peptides and peptides from the individual patient
sample as light-labeled peptides.) Both heavy- and light-labeled peptides
were identiﬁed and quantiﬁed at false discovery rate 1%, and homoge-
neous proteins were grouped by MaxQuant (Version 1.4.1.2) (Cox and
Mann, 2008). The light-labeled peptide abundances were normalized by
their paired heavy-labeled peptide abundances. These normalized light-
labeled peptide abundances were used for SALPS.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation results

SALPS had good performances in detecting differential proteins.
Here, we compared SALPS with two alternative approaches.
One approach was to omit missing data and to carry the linear
regression on the remaining data. This is known as the complete
case analysis. Here, we denote it as LinearC. The variants of the
complete case data analysis were often used in the proteomics
(Oberg et al., 2008; Radulovic et al., 2004; Ryu et al., 2008;
Wang et al., 2003). The other approach was the linear regression
with imputation (denoted as LinearI). It is a simple approach

Fig. 2. Simulation results showing the number of differentially expressed proteins versus q-value at varying parameter values of (b, 11). b was the
probability that missing values were generated from the total quantiﬁcation-dependent missing mechanism. 11 was the magnitude of association between
mean peptide intensities and missing rates. 12 was the magnitude of association between k values and missing rates (12 = 0.50). The solid lines were based
on the estimated q-values, while the dotted lines were based on the actual q-values

that handles intensity-dependent missing data. In this approach,
we obtained the minimum observed peptide intensity for each
peptide and replaced missing values of the corresponding peptide
with this minimum value.

As shown in Figure 2, SALPS identiﬁed more differential pro-
teins than LinearC and LinearI in most of the parameter space,
(t1, t2, b). The only exception was when there was a relatively
weak association between peptide intensities and missing values
(a smaller value of $1). In this case, SALPS performed slightly
worse than LinearC (Fig. 2a). But, the difference in the number
of differential proteins at q<0.01 was 3.8% on average (See
Supplementary Materials). While SALPS performed the best or
very close to the best, the performances of LinearC and LinearI
ﬂuctuated. Fixing parameters, b( = 0.50) and t2( = 0.50), LinearC
performed better than LinearI for a smaller value of n (Fig. 2a
and b). For a bigger value of $1, LinearI performed better
(Fig. 2c). This was expected because LinearI does not perform
well when missing rate of peptide intensities does not reﬂect the
peptide intensities much.

We also investigated the relationship between the model per-
formances and the proportion of part B (represented by b) in
Figure 1. Again, our model performed the best or close to the
best as the parameter, b, varies. However, as the proportion of
part B increased (bigger b value), LinearC performed better than
LinearI (Fig. 21). As the proportion of part B decreased, LinearI

performed better (Fig. 2d and e). This implies that the missing
values have valuable information when experiments have similar
total numbers of quantiﬁed peptides and that it is better to
remove missing values when experiments have different total
numbers of quantiﬁed peptides. SALPS also performed well
with varying r2. More simulations with varying Q values were
also found in the Supplementary Materials.

In addition, we compare the performance of Karpievitch et al.
(2009) and Wang et al. (2012) in the simulated datasets. Wang
et al. (2012) performed better than Karpievitch et al. (2009), but
not as good as LinearI, LinearC and SALPS (Supplementary
Figure 5S). For example, in the simulation dataset, where
b =0.50, t1 =0.75, r2 =0.50, the numbers of truly differentially
expressed proteins detected by LinearI and LinearC are >75%
of the true differential proteins detected by SALPS, but this per-
centage reduced to <50% for Karpievitch et al. (2009) and Wang
et al. (2012).

Because in the simulated data, the true set of differential pro-
teins was known, we computed the actual q-values based on the
number of proteins that were falsely classiﬁed as differential pro-
teins. Our q-values based on the bootstrap-based tests were close
to the actual q-values (Fig. 2). The dotted lines in Figure 2
represented the actual q-values given the number of signiﬁcant
proteins. The dotted lines of SALPS were close to their estimated
(solid) lines.

Differential protein expression

 

At estimated q<0.01, ~99% of differential proteins detected
were from the true set of differential proteins for all three
approaches. When b = 0.50, t1 = 0.75, r2 = 0.50, SALPS detected
2273 proteins from the true set of differential proteins (q<0.01).
At the same q—value threshold, LinearC and LinearI detected
2007 and 2060 proteins from the true set, respectively. A total
of 1760 proteins were detected by all three approaches.

3.2 Monocyte proteomics data results

SALPS performed well in the monocyte proteomics data of
trauma patients. Using this dataset, we were interested in iden-
tifying proteins of which the abundance was different between
two patients groups (uncomplicated versus complicated recovery
patients). SALPS detected 78 differential proteins at q<0.0001
and 107 differential proteins at q<0.01. These proteins were
known to be associated with inﬂammatory response, immunolo-
gical disease and organismal abnormalities. For examples, matrix
metalloproteinase 8 (MMP8) was detected as signiﬁcant by only
SALPS. Matrix metalloproteinses were well known to be import-
ant in various inﬂammatory diseases (Lagente and Boichot,
2008). Speciﬁcally, Quintero et al. (2010) had shown that
MMP8 in monocytes reduced acute lung inﬂammation and
injury in mice. In our proteomics data of monocytes from pa-
tients, MMP8 was more abundant in patients of uncomplicated
recovery than complicated recovery, which aligned well with the
anti-inﬂammatory role of MMP8. Besides, damage-speciﬁc bind-
ing protein (DDBl) was not detected as signiﬁcant by LinearC,
but by SALPS and LinearI. In our monocytes proteomics data,
the complicated recovery patients had more DDBl proteins in
their monocytes than the uncomplicated patients within 12h
after the injury. This could indicate that complicated recovery
patients needed more DDBl proteins for DNA repair (Dualan
et al., 1995). However, as part of the cullin4-DDB1 E3 ubiquitin
ligase complex, multiple studies had shown that DDBl was
essential for viruses to escape from innate immune sensing
(Andrejeva et al., 2002; Laguette et al., 2014; Leupin et al.,
2003; Precious et al., 2005). Further studies are needed to discern
the functional impact of differentially expressed DDBl in trauma
patients.

In terms of the number of differential proteins, the perform-
ance of SALPS was better than the traditional approaches
(Fig. 3). Our approach detected ~25 and 300% more differential
proteins than LinearI and LinearC, respectively (q<0.01). Over
96 and 90% of differential proteins detected by LinearC and
LinearI were also detected by SALPS at the same q threshold.
LinearI worked well in this dataset identifying more differential
proteins than LinearC. In contrast, when we applied these algo-
rithms to another dataset, while SALPS still performed the best,
LinearC performed better than LinearI (see Supplementary
Materials). The algorithms of Karpievitch et al. (2009) and
Wang et al. (2012) did not converge when applied to the mono-
cyte proteomics data.

The percentage of ,BgBygB <0 was 81.31% at q<0.01. For the
rest of proteins with ,BgB ygB > 0, testing Holg and H0, determined

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

We developed a SALPS and demonstrated its performance. As
shown in our simulation studies (Fig. 2), it was important to
recognize the different causes of peptide missing values and to
handle them appropriately. Our model was ﬂexible enough to
handle missing values from different sources.

There are a few things we want to mention about our pro-
posed approach. First, we used a (log)normal distribution in the
linear regression part. However, one can use a truncated normal
distribution in place of the normal distribution. This model
would be the truncated normal hurdle model (W ooldridge,
2010). Second, we used the percentage of opposite signs between
,BgB and ygB to determine the ﬁltering threshold (kth). One can
also use a rank correlation between group covariates in linear
regression and probit regression and chose kth that gives the
smallest rank correlation. Third, SALPS estimates more param-
eters than the traditional approaches (e.g. 2p parameters were
estimated in SALPS versus p parameters in LinearI and
LinearC), thus demands larger sample sizes.

Nowadays, large-scale proteomics studies have become in-
creasingly important in biomedical research. Such a study
can provide a large-scale assessment of the relationship be-
tween proteomics and clinical outcomes. Potential protein
biomarkers can be used to further develop diagnostic and thera-
peutic targets. To detect as many potential protein biomarkers
as possible with high conﬁdence, it is important to use the
appropriate bioinformatics algorithm. The development of
SALPS was motivated by analyzing an ongoing multicenter clin-
ical study to examine the proteomic response to severe injury in
blood leukocytes, which currently includes MS analysis of >2100
samples of isolated monocytes, T cells and neutrophils from
trauma patients. We believe that SALPS can provide the valu-
able information in such large-scale population proteomics
studies.

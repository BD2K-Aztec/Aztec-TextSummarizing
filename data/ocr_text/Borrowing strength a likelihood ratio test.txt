ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cancer biology is a field where the complexity of
the phenomena battles against the availability of data. Often only
a few observations per signal source, i.e. genes, are available.
Such scenarios are becoming increasingly more relevant as modern
sensing technologies generally have no trouble in measuring lots of
channels, but where the number of subjects, such as patients or
samples, is limited. In statistics, this problem falls under the heading
‘large p, small 12’. Moreover, in such situations the use of asymptotic
analytical results should generally be mistrusted.

Results: We consider two cancer datasets, with the aim to mine
the activity of functional groups of genes. We propose a hierarchical
model with two layers in which the individual signals share a
common variance component. A likelihood ratio test is defined for
the difference between two collections of corresponding signals.
The small number of observations requires a careful consideration
of the bias of the statistic, which is corrected through an explicit
Bartlett correction. The test is validated on Monte Carlo simulations,
which show improved detection of differences compared with other
methods. In a leukaemia study and a cancerous fibroblast cell line,
we find that the method also works better in practice, i.e. it gives a
richer picture of the underlying biology.

1 INTRODUCTION

In this article, we develop a likelihood ratio (LR) test that aims to
detect small concordant changes in a collection of related signals
under two experimental conditions. Under certain conditions, it
can be shown that the LR test is the most powerful test in many
practical testing problems and potentially offers deeper insight
into complex phenomena, e. g. the biological processes underlying
cancer development. Exact calculation, however, is not always easy.
Previous work (Ideker et al., 2000) used LR tests for evaluating
changes in a single signal in the area of microarray analysis. Our
approach here differs from theirs by considering multiple concordant
changes. (Kong et al., 2006) suggested to use Hotelling’s T 2 statistic
for this purpose, but this is only a viable alternative when the
number of observations exceeds the number of channels. This is

in many modern genomic applications not the case. Alternatives
are ANCOVA approaches (Hummel et al., 2008; Mansmann and
Meister, 2005), but compared with the Hotelling T 2 test they
lose some power for correlated channels. Our approach is further
motivated by recent work that developed a global gene expression
estimation method for testing association with clinical outcome
(Goeman et al., 2004), although that test either makes asymptotic
assumptions for calculating signiﬁcance, which may be too liberal,
or uses permutation, which may not be optimal. The test we propose
takes into account the ‘magnitude and uncertainty’ of the changes.

In the ﬁeld of microarray analyses, two-stage methods have been
proposed that look for over-represented functional classes, e.g. as
deﬁned by gene ontology (GO), among differentially expressed
genes (Al-Shahrour et al., 2005; Breitling et al., 2004; Martin et al.,
2004). Although these methods are very powerful and simple, they
tend to look at clearly differentially expressed genes among which
patterns are to be found. These methods are exploratory in nature
and often require an arbitrary cutoff for the second stage analyses.
Our method is more a higher level exploratory method, which is
more sensitive to concordant small changes and does not require
arbitrary dichotomies.

2 MODEL FOR RELATED SIGNALS

Our aim is to devise a model for the expression of replicates of
m-related signals measured across two different conditions, say x
and y. This is a situation that is common in many high—frequency
sensing data, such as in astronomy, geography and ﬁnance. The
use of traditional mixed-effect models has also proved popular
within functional genomics. (Wolﬁnger et al., 2001) proposed a
simple mixed model combined with two-stage effect estimation for
detecting individually differentially expressed genes. Their model
allows for systematic nuisance effects; however, the estimation of
the effects of interest, i.e. the signals, is performed one-by-one using
individual gene-speciﬁc variances. These individual gene variances
ignore the fact that there is something common about the underlying
measurements. Others, such as (Kerr et al., 2000) and (Rosa et al.,
2005), have proposed models with a common variance, stressing that
one can borrow strength from measurements in the other channels,
but ignoring that there can still be orders of magnitude difference
between measurements.

Ordinary mixed-effect models are therefore not suited for
modelling sets of related, but possibly quantitatively different
signals. Instead, we need to think about a model that data adaptively
can move between a model that assumes individual variances for
each of the signals, to one that takes a common variance. For this

We assume that channels measure similar kinds of quantities.
This is for instance the case in microarray experiments, where each

presence of ‘similar’ signals, we shall assume the unknown variance

3 INFERENCE

The aim is to test whether the two conditions are same or
differ in one or more channels. Traditionally, one considered
series of univariate tests to tackle this question. However, modern

measurement instruments typically have lots of parallel channels.
Besides the difﬁculty of inferentially combining lots of tests, the
fundamental problem is that univariate tests ignore the information,
resulting from the similarity of the channels. Therefore, here we
consider a single test, which tests the joint equality of all the
average signal strength in all the channels across the two conditions,
Hoiuf=M§,VjSm.

Asymptotically, under certain regularity conditions, the likelihood
ratio statistic provides the most powerful test. However, when each
of the signal sources has only a small number of observations, the
distribution of such statistic can deviate heavily from its asymptotic
X2 distribution. The Bartlett correction is a ﬁrst-order correction of
likelihood ratio test statistic and involves rescaling the test statistic
to have the correct X2 mean under the null hypothesis with a ﬁnite
sample.

The model we have described is a highly parametric model.
However, inference based on the model is not very much affected
by violation of these parametric assumptions. In particular, the
likelihood ratio statistic will, even for skewed distributions such as
log—normal distribution, be approximately X2 distributed if n 3 30.
For larger m the likelihood ratio statistic will become more and more
normally distribution, irrespective of the number of observations
n. In realistic scenarios, such as microarray studies where the
groups are deﬁned through GO terms or KEGG categories, the
group size m is typically at least 20. For a moderate number
of observations, e.g. n=38 such as in the leukaemia example in
Section 4.3.2, this means that even if the underlying data are not
normally distributed the likelihood ratio test is still expected to
work. Often data in measurement channels are strictly positive
and therefore right-tailed. In such cases, it is obviously possible to
transform the data beforehand, e. g. by some power transformation
or the log-transformation.

3.1 Likelihood ratio statistic

In general, the logarithm of the likelihood ratio test statistic is
deﬁned as

A(X, Y): —2[ sup {1(9 |X, Y)}— sup {l(9|X, Y)}},
6690 GEO

where @0 are the hypothesized values under H0. We consider
separately the maximization of the likelihood under H0 and the full
parameter space.

explicit use of partial derivatives, provides a robust alternative to
NR iteration. Using the same starting values 80, the NM yielded
excellent agreement with NR.

In cases where the maximum likelihood for 8 achieves SMLE =

which is the usual pooled ML estimate of the variance. In order to
be able to evaluate the values of lo and 11 within the likelihood
ratio test statistic, we require the value of log-likehood under
these estimates. Applying an asymptotic expansion for the gamma

For large samples, n =nx +ny, the distribution of A(x, y) is
approximately distributed like a X63 distribution, where q =dim® —

BC = EH0{A(x,y)}/m
= -2EH0(lo—l1)/m (10)

with lo and 11 deﬁned in Equations (2) and (3). By deﬁning the
small sample likelihood ratio statistic as ABC (x, y) = A(x, y) /BC , we
achieve that precisely the Bartlett corrected likelihood ratio statistic
has EH0 {ABC} =m as would be expected for a x31 distribution.
Calculation of these two expectations in general is very involved.

with Monte Carlo simulations of the same value. We also check the

correction columns are the three derived approximations, where Equation (17) is the
simplest and most conservative one.

the null hypothesis of no differential signals in all of the channels.

Table 1 shows the comparison between the three forms
of the Bartlett correction. The column with the Monte Carlo
approximations should be seen as the (approximately) true values
that the ﬁnal three columns try to approximate. Importantly, the
Bartlett correction that we propose is independent of or and 8, given
that it is based on the asymptotic approximation (9), in particular,
on large values of 8. Therefore, it is not very surprising that the ﬁrst
approximation (15) does an excellent job in capturing the Bartlett
correction for 8 = 10 000. However, for large values of or and 8,
each of the channels is forced to have a similar variance and simpler
methods would be available. On the other hand, the approximation
(15) is somewhat liberal for small values for or and 8. The somewhat
more conservative and very simple upperbound (17) of the Bartlett
Correction results in better agreement with Monte Carlo runs in that
case. For small m, the latter lies closer to the upperbound and for
large m closer to its lowerbound.

Therefore, we conclude that for cases in which there is some
channel variance heterogeneity (i.e. small to moderate 8, relative
to J5), the simple Bartlett-Correction approximation, n / n — 2, does
do an excellent job as ﬁrst-order correction of the likelihood-ratio
statistic.

3.4 Dependent channels

The Bartlett-corrected likelihood ratio test (BC-LRT) we proposed
in this section makes some allowance for dependence between
the channels. In fact, the common variance distribution induces
some dependence on the measurements within the same channel.
However, conditionally on the variance the data from the individual
channels are assumed to be independent. This may be unproblematic
in many practical circumstances, especially when m is small and
the channels show only small correlation. However, in many
circumstances the dependence between the channels may be
substantial. For example, voxels on a fMRI scan or messenger
RNA (mRN A) data from genes with a common transcription factor
will show high interdependence. In such cases, we should make
allowance for the fact that the information that comes from the
various channels cannot be considered m pieces of separately
supporting evidence. In this section, we describe how this impacts

The value m refers to the number of genes in the GO-class, whereas m* is the number

the likelihood-ratio statistic and how we can accommodate this in
the test.

Crucially, as the likelihood ratio statistic, conditionally on or and
8 is a sum of channel data, dependence between the channels will
not affect the mean of the likelihood ratio statistic. Therefore, as
the Bartlett is a mean-value correction, it, conditional on or and
8, is also not affected by the dependence. Clearly, the shape of the
distribution is affected. In the extreme case, if the data in a particular
group consisted of m identical copies, the likelihood ratio statistic
for sufﬁcient sample size n would be a rescaled X12 variable under

H0, in fact m X X12 distributed, rather than a x31 random variable.

The following shows a practical guide to adjust the likelihood ratio
statistic in the case of dependence between the variables. The idea
is to estimate the number of independent variables by the number
of channels needed to explain at least, say, 95% of the correlation
in the data. This is done by considering eigenvalues of the observed
correlation matrix and calculating the number of eigenvalues to
exceed 95 % of the total sum. Notice that if n = nx +ny < m, the rank
of the correlation matrix is less than full rank and this method will
always conservatively suggest dependence, whereas the data could
be fully independent. In fact, when n < m the method work, but
will give conservative P-values. If one has additional information
that the channels are stochastically independent and the number of
observations n is of the same order as or smaller than m, it would
be better not to use the correction.

Consider the following two examples. In two groups of size m = 4
channels, the observed correlation matrices are, respectively, given
as

1.00 0.99 0.00 0.00
0.99 1.00 0.00 0.00 and

leukaemia example discussed in Section 4.3.2. Table 2 shows a
subset of the 235 GO terms under consideration and how the
potential dependence affects the power of the test.

4 APPLICATION

This section applies the method both to simulated and real data.
It is important to note that the computational performance of the
method does not deteriorate with larger number of observations
or channels. In fact, the numerical maximization described in
Section 3.1 converges slower with a small number of channels,
since the optimum is more likely obtained for a degenerate channel
variance (8,01 —> 00), which is computationally more expensive.

4.1 Simulation study

In this section, we ascertain two aspects of the Bartlett-corrected
test, to wit (i) its nominal coverage probability and (ii) its power.
We consider two series simulations to test either aspect of the test.
We would like to compare the method with possible alternatives.
The Hotelling T 2 test (Prokhorov, 2001) is a natural alternative
to our method as it is similarly multivariate and under full channel—
variance inhomogeneity (close to) the optimal test. One important
disadvantage of the Hotelling T 2 test is that it is only deﬁned for a
few more observations than channels, i.e. n > m +2. This means that
for the simulations nx+ny=n=4,m=2 and nx+ny=n=4,m=5
no Hotelling T 2 alternative can be calculated. This limits the use
of the Hotelling T 2, alternative in sparse data situations. In these

Fig. 2. Coverage probabilities of the BC-LRTs, in comparison with Sidak corrected univariate t-tests (n=4,m=2 and n=4,m=5) and the Hotelling T2

alternative (n = 12,m = 2 and n = 12,m = 5) based on 300 simulations

cases, it is possible to test the composite null hypothesis through a
series of univariate tests, joined through multiple testing correction,
such as a step-down Sidak correction, i.e. Pgidékz 1 — (1 —P(1))m,
where the P0) is the smallest observed P-value (Dudoit et al. , 2003).
We would like to point out that, despite the small sample sizes, the
t-tests are the optimal tests to use ‘from a univariate point of view’.

4.1.] Is the method unbiased? In this section, we show that the
method does not systemically give low P-values. This is essential,
otherwise it would lead to an unfair comparison to the other methods.
A way to test whether there is bias is to apply the method in the case
where there are no differences between the channels. In that case, the
resulting P-value should be an uniformly distributed value between
0 and 1. The ideal line in Figure 2 should therefore be a straight line
going from (0,0) to (1,1).

In the ﬁrst set of simulations, we consider 300 draws from the
null model, according to Equation (2), in which a = 3 and 8 = 1 / 3.
Furthermore, we vary the number of observations (n=nx +ny) at

two levels, 4 and 12, and the number of simultaneous channels
(m) at 2 and 5. These are challenging conditions for inference due
to a large variance heterogeneity—as a result of a small 8—and
a small number of observations n. The aim is to see whether the
method gives indeed rise to approximate uniform P-values. The
plots in Figure 2 show the results for each of the four scenarios for
the raw LR test, for two version of the BC—LRT and for Hotelling
T 2 test.

What we can see is that the most conservative Bartlett correction
(17), i.e. the simple n /n—2, is very close to the nominal coverage
probability in each of the simulations. Notice that for two channels
m = 2, there is no difference between the Equations (15 ) and (17) and
therefore only the latter is shown. The Hotelling T 2 test naturally
achieves the nominal coverage probabilities by the very deﬁnition
of a T 2 distribution.

4.1.2 Power of method In order to test the power of the procedure,
we perform a simulation where half of the times all the m

Fig. 3. Receiver operating characteristics of Hotelling T2 versus Bartlett corrected LRT using factor n/n —2 for (a) various sample sizes n, various numbers
of channels m, with effect size [1,, — ,uy = 0.5 and variance heterogeneity given by or = 3, 6 = 1 / 3; (b) for a larger number of channels m = 30, with effect size
[1,, — ,uy = 0.1 and a larger level of variance homogeneity (or = 12, 6 =4 / 3). Both simulations are based on 600 hypotheses: 300 had effect size 0 and 300 had
effect size as indicated above. For clarity, the legends are in the order of the lines in the graph

channels show activity in the presence of channel heterogeneity
(a = 3 and 6 = 1 / 3). We perform a total of 600 simulations, whereby
half of the null hypotheses are true and the other half false with
effect size ,ux — ,uy 20.5. We plot the receiver operating curve for
the simulation in Figure 3a. From this we can clearly see that the BC-
LRT has signiﬁcant power. However, in cases where the Hotelling
T 2 test can be used, i.e. if the number of observations are somewhat
larger than than the number of channels, to wit n > m+2, then this
test achieves a higher power. This is due to the fact that in these
simulation there are so few channels m: it is impossible to ‘borrow’
much ‘strength’ across the channels present.

A second simulation shows the dependence of the power of the
likelihood ratio test on the variance heterogeneity and the numbers of
channels present. We look at m = 30 channels with the same average
variance as above, but with two levels of variance heterogeneity, i.e.
a 23,6 21/3 and a 2 12,6 24/3. From Figure 3b, we can see how
in these cases the likelihood ratio test beats the Hotelling T 2 test.
Moreover, the more variance homogeneity, the larger the power of
the test. The power of Hotelling T 2 test does not depend on the
variance heterogeneity and only a single line has been plotted. As
before, the simulation is based on 600 iterations, whereby 300 under
H0 and 300 under H1 (here, effect size is taken ,ux — ,uy 20.1).

4.2 Comparison with other methods

It is crucial to compare the performance of the test with other
standard methods for combining P-values across joint hypotheses.
Effectively there are two approaches. Traditionally, the most
common method is to combine univariate P-values into a single
group P-value that represents the overall signiﬁcance of those
group of test. Fisher’s combined probability test (Manly, 1985)
was proposed early on as a way to test a single (joint) hypothesis
through m independent P-values. Under the null hypothesis each

P-value was independently uniform and, therefore, minus the sum
of the log-transformed P-values would be X2 distributed with 2m
degrees of freedom. Despite its easy applicability, this P-value
combination method is not very often applied in a bioinformatics
context. More commonly, P-values of several individual tests are
‘combined’ through some multiple testing procedure to explore
whether something, and what, is happening. Of those the Bonferroni
correction is most famous, but the Sidak correction is, in the
case of independent P-values, more sensitive. On the other hand,
Hotelling T 2 approach was a model-based approach for testing a
joint hypothesis directly. This is similar to the likelihood ratio test
we proposed and the Global test (Goeman et al., 2004).

4.3 Two microarray applications

Microarray gene expression experiments typically measure the
behaviour of a large number of genes with a relatively small number
of independent biological samples. The small number of independent
samples limits the statistical inference that can be made about the
behaviour of individual genes. Consequently, the microarray analyst
is faced with bewildering lists of differentially expressed (DE)
genes that are typically full of false positives—a direct result of
the well-known ‘small-n-large—p’ dimensionality problem: only a
few samples available and many genes to consider.

At the same time biologists are using microarrays to understand
processes involving the collective action of a number of genes, often
organized as a complex or pathway (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011).
To address these needs and remedy the problem of dimensionality,
we consider applying the BC-LRT to detect differentially expressed
pre-assigned groups of genes. GO (Ashburner et al., 2000) is a
bioinformatics initiative to unify the representation of genes and
gene products across the whole biological spectrum. At the leaves
of this directed acyclic graph or tree-like representation are the

testing. Group-wise P-values of normal and cancerous ﬁbroblast genes involving eight

individual genes, whereas higher up in the tree so-called annotation
terms unify groups of genes. All the genes that fall under a particular
annotation term typically relate to some functional property of these
genes and are therefore ideal candidates for a group-wise analysis.

4.3.] Comparison of cancerous and normal ﬁbroblast cells We
focus on a study by Nighean Barr (Wit and McClure, 2004), which
aimed to study differences in expression in cancerous and normal
ﬁbroblast cells. The ﬁbroblast tissue used was created in vitro
from two cell lines—one cancerous and one normal. From each of
these two cell lines, four separate replicates were obtained. Pairs of
cancerous and normal replicates were then hybridized to four two-
channel cDNA arrays, resulting in eight observations. The presence
of a slide effect requires some sort of correction. The simplest
possible correction, i.e. pairing the data, would reduce the number of
independent samples to four. However, the availability of thousands
(9216) of gene expressions per slide means that we can use a
ﬂexible slide correction model (df % 20) and still obtain an effective
number of observations 8 — 4 X 20 / 4 X 9216 = 7.998 close to 8. This
correction has been applied before analyzing the data. We focus on
94 groups of genes identiﬁed by various GO terms. The group or
channel size, m, varies from 4 to 178. It is clear that in most of these
cases it is impossible to apply a Hotelling T 2 test as m exceeds n.
We report the top 17 of the 94 GO terms in Table 3.

From Table 3, we can see that only 3 of the 17 GO terms
were declared differentially expressed by all four methods, i.e. the
Sidak adjusted t-tests, Global test (Goeman et al., 2004), Fisher’s
combined probability test (Manly, 1985) and our likelihood ratio
test with the most conservative Bartlett correction. These GO terms
are cystatin, gap junction protein (GJ P) and Claudin. Below, we refer
to GO terms as negative or positive DE, i.e. expression levels for
the cancerous condition are, respectively, mainly less or more than
for normal. Only three GO terms are negative DE: cystatin, GJ P and

laminin. Cystatin (also known as steﬁn) genes are responsible for
inhibiting cysteine proteases, i.e. enzymes that degrade proteins by
hydrolysis and are typically down regulated in skin cancer (Keppler,
2006), concurring with our ﬁnding. GJP is a family of membrane
proteins (connexin genes) that enables trafﬁcking, through channels,
of small ions and metabolites between neighbouring cells. Important
for cell—cell communication and coordination, GJPs maintain tissue
homeostasis. Cancer is a genetic disease involving aberrant cell
behaviour so that DE of GJP, that results in a loss of coordination
and homeostasis, is consistent with disruption by tumour activity.
Human skin consists of a thin epidermal layer attached by a
basement membrane (BM) to a dermal layer of ﬁbroblast-dominated
connective tissue (Sorrell and Caplan, 2004). Laminin is in important
constituent of BM and the direction of DE is tissue— and tumour-
speciﬁc, e.g. a gene for laminin 332 is positive and negative DE
for squamous and basal cell carcinomas, respectively (Marinkovich,
2007). Claudin, a family of cell-membrane tight junction proteins, is
also tissue-speciﬁc (Singh et al., 2010). Laminin G0 is detected by
our LRT-BC at the 5% level whereas at best it is marginal by Fisher’s,
Global or Sidak tests. A roughly similar pattern of detection occurs
for spectrin, an intracellular scaffold protein that maintains cell
membrane and cytoskeletal integrity, and ﬁbulin, an extracellular
matrix (ECM) protein secreted by cells.

Cyclin orchestrates the cell cycle by directing cyclin-dependent
kinase activity. Production and subsequent degradation of cyclin
by proteolysis are critical for cell cycle control. Cyclin genes
with pronounced DE are involved with S, G2 and mitosis phases.
Proteasomes are cylindrical protein structures within each cell
that contain active sites where proteolysis occurs. Up-regulation
of proteasome therefore indicates increased proteolysis so ’new
can be made from old’ and is consistent with down-regulation
of inhibitors (e.g. cystatin). Similar trends occur for cyclin, cell
division and mitochondria, that supplies ATP and is involved
with many cell-signalling pathways; so the GO terms indicate
tumour cell proliferation and growth — a hallmark of cancer
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). None of the four GO terms is
detected by the Sidak or Global tests at the 5% signiﬁcance
level, and Fisher’s test is marginal for cyclin and helicase.
Tumoru’s exhibit unstable genomes and this is shown by DE
of enzymes. Helicase, for example, drives the unwinding of
DNA or RNA helices into separate stands and is crucial for
replication, transcription, etc. Polymerases are involved in copying
and reading of DNA and RNA and often work co-operatively with
helicase motor proteins. Only the LRT-BC test conﬁrms DE of
the two GO terms; the other three tests exhibit, at best, marginal
DE. Similar results are found for the translocase gene family
involved with moving molecules across membranes and chromatin
remodelling.

Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a signalling protein
produced by cells that stimulates angiogenesis needed by cells
to access oxygen and nutrients from blood. DE of VEGF occurs
in premalignant neoplastic lesions as well developed tumours
(Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011) and it is noteworthy this angiogenic
factor is detected only by the LRT-BC and Fisher’s test. Of further
interest is the expression of insulin-like growth factor (IGF) G0,
a complex of proteins that cells use to communicate. Fibroblast
dermal cells, for example, communicate survival factor IGF-1 to
neighbouring epithelial keratinoctes (Lewis et al., 2009) and the
reduction of IGF-2 signal in tumoarigenic pathways has been shown

to reduce tumour growth (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011). Up-
regulation of IGF GO, therefore, conﬁrms ﬁbroblast skin cancer
growth and proliferation. Importantly, only the LRT-BC detects IGF
G0, the other tests being marginal at best. Fibroblasts are stromal
cells that typically produce collagen for ECM connective tissue.
Positive DE for keratin in the ﬁbroblast cancer suggests a possible
mesenchymal-to-epithelial transition (MET) and EMT since keratin
can be expressed by ﬁbroblasts recruited into cancer stroma (Ishii
et al. , 2005). EMT and MET trans-differentiation therefore suggests
invasiveness, another hallmark of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg,
2011). All tests declare keratin as DE, except Global which is
marginal. The cell- surface receptor, Fas, also known as CD95, forms
the death-inducing signalling complex (DISC) and the ultra-low
P-value indicates apoptosis (programmed cell death or suicide).
The conventional view is that apoptosis reduces cancer by attrition,
but paradoxically tumours often express high levels of Fas/CD95.
Recent evidence suggests that Fas could in fact have multiple roles
apart from DISC, for example, crosstalk may be involved with
Fas signalling, and importantly that the skin cancer cells have
may become apoptosis resistant (Chen et al., 2010; Green, 2010;
Hanahan and Weinberg, 2011; Peter et al., 2007). Insensitivity to
death signalling is yet another hallmark of cancer. Three tests detect
Fas DE, whereas Sidak is marginal.

The above analysis of GO terms for the skin cancer dataset clearly
shows the LRT-BC detecting many more GO terms than the other
three tests and reveals important cancer hallmarks, e. g. tumour
cell proliferation, growth, resistance to cell death, angiogenesis
and possibly trans-differentiation and invasiveness. Altogether, they
indicate the development of a tumour micro-environment and
suggest a follow-up study. LRT-BC has been shown in a previous
section to be more sensitive and unbiased. It presents, therefore, a
balanced and complete picture of signiﬁcant GO activity of skin
cancer ﬁbroblasts.

4.3.2 Leukaemia In leukaemia gene expression study, Golub
et al. (1999) considered 38 bone marrow samples obtained from
acute leukaemia patients at the time of diagnosis. Of these 38
samples, 11 were from acute myeloid leukaemia (AML) patients
and 27 from acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) patients. RNA
prepared from bone marrow mononuclear cells was hybridized to
high-density oligonucleotide microarrays, produced by Affymetrix
and containing probes for 6817 human genes. For each gene, the
experimenters obtained a quantitative expression level. Samples
were subjected to a priori quality control standards regarding the
amount of labelled RNA and the quality of the scanned microarray
image. After preproces sing Dudoit et al. (2002), the dataset consisted
of 3051 genes and 38 tumour mRNA samples. The aim of this study
was to obtain a automatically derived class predictor to determine
the class of new leukaemia cases. Although it is possible to create
such a predictor with a large number of individual genes, in a second
stage one is interested in a biological explanation of the difference
between the two types of leukaemia.

In this analysis, we considered 235 GO classes, each one with at
least ﬁve genes present on the microarray. For each GO class, we
calculated P-values according to our LRT with the most conservative
Bartlett correction and Goeman’s Global test. A summary of the
results are shown in Figure 4, whereas a detailed list of results for
all GO classes is given in the Supplementary Materials. From this
two important features become clear: (i) although the Global test

graph represents the number of genes in each GO class

and the LRT pick up the same signal, the LRT is, in general, more
powerful and (ii) the larger the group size m, the more powerful the
LRT test becomes. In fact, the correlation between the difference in
log P-value for the two methods and the group size is 0.55. This
feature, i.e. more power when m increases, is exactly what we call
‘borrowing strength’ in the title of this article.

There are important GO classes that the global test would have
missed in this case. For example ATP-dependent helicase activity
(GO:0008026) was non-signiﬁcant at the 5% level for the Global test
(not even considering multiple testing), but was highly signiﬁcant
(P-value < 0.001) for the LRT. This class of eight genes drives the
unwinding of a DNA or RNA helix and seems to be important in
distinguishing between ALL and AML cases.

5 CONCLUDING REMARKS

A property of many modern measurement techniques is the ability
to measure simultaneously large numbers of features. Often it is
of interest to test for concordant changes in particular subgroups of
these features. One can think of groups of genes, so-called pathways,
in genomic data or groups of labelled pixels in remote sensing data
as part of astronomical images, fMRI brain scans or geographic
surveys. Typically measurements are roughly on the same scale, but
assuming a common variance is too restrictive.

Sequential univariate tests with a ‘multiple testing correction’,
such as the Sidak-like correction, are commonly used in such
situations. Although they are simple, they are not particularly
powerful to detecting small concordant changes in many channels.
Multivariate tests, such as Hotelling’s T 2 test, are traditionally used
to deal with testing movement in multiple dimensions, but are not
suited when the number of dimensions (m) exceeds the number of
observations (n). This is typically the case in modern multichannel
data. Other methods considered in this article are Fisher’s method
of combining P-values and Goeman’s Global test. In the case of
real applications, both methods work reasonably well, but do not
achieve the same power as the likelihood ratio test with the most
conservative Bartlett correction.

Likelihood ratio test for related sparse signals

 

The advantage of the likelihood ratio test proposed in this
article consists ‘borrowing information’, i.e. sharing of variance
information across the measurement channels. We have shown in
a practical example how the power increases when the number
of features goes up. Moreover, its ability to detecting small but
concordant changes across a large number of signal sources makes
it preferable over more commonly used univariate tests. Ultimately,
this sensitive test gives us a richer picture of the underlying biology,
as we have shown in the comparison of normal and cancerous
ﬁbroblast cells.

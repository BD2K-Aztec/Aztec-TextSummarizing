ABSTRACT

Summary: The Microbial Proteomic Resource (MPR) is a
repository service that contains non-redundant protein databases
of related bacterial strains, which were generated through an in-
house developed software called Multi-Strain Mass Spectrometry
Prokaryotic DataBase Builder (MSMSpdbb). MSMSpdbb merges and
clusters protein sequences inferred from genomic sequences, and
provide a protein list in FASTA format that covers for divergence in
gene annotation, translational start site choice and presence of single
nucleotide polymorphisms and other mutations.

Availability: MSMSpdbb was developed in C++ using the Qt
libraries (Nokia) and licensed under the GNU General Public License
version 2. MSMSpdbb is freely available, and its installation files,
instructions for use and additional documentation can be found at
the MPR web site http://org.uib.no/prokaryotedb/ can also be found
at Proteomecommons.org (see Supplementary Methods for Hash
number).

1 INTRODUCTION

There are currently >900 completed bacterial genomic sequences
available and over 3000 ongoing genome projects (Genomes Online
Database GOLD) (Kyrpides, 1999). For proteomic purposes, there
are often several relevant annotated genomic sequences available,
and it may be difﬁcult to select the best option for characterization
of the experimental data. Different bioinformatic approaches for
annotation of genes are currently used and this affects the quality
of annotated protein lists used in proteomics (de Souza et al.,
2008; de Souza et al., 2009). Characterization of clinical bacterial
isolates with many speciﬁc genetic variations is suboptimal if
they are not represented in the selected database. Recent data
suggest that microbial Virulence can be related to single nucleotide

polymorphisms (SNPs) (Garcia Pelayo et al., 2009), and information
from more than one sequenced genome can be relevant. Therefore,
it is crucial to provide protein databases that can compensate for
annotation errors and cover genetic variations among closely related
organisms, and that provide readily identiﬁable unique observations.
This limitation is acknowledged by the efforts of investigators
to provide non-redundant protein databases with high genomic
coverage, as for example the International Protein Index (Kersey
et al., 2004).

The software Multi-Strain Mass Spectrometry Prokaryotic
DataBase Builder (MSMSpdbb) can merge protein databases from
several sources and be applied on any prokaryotic organism. The
clustering is performed so that sequences sharing high similarity
are merged and reported only once, and unique peptide sequences
observed in polymorphisms or with different translational start
site (TSS) choices are appended to the primary sequence in a
MS—friendly manner using non-assigned characters as previously
described by Schandorff et al. (2007). In short, N-terminal tryptic
peptides from divergent predictions of the TSS are appended to the
main sequence and separated by the code ‘0’, and polymorphic
peptides are appended with the code ‘J’. Currently, this can be
applied only using an in—house Mascot server, since the engine
search tool need to be set up to recognize those two letters as
a theoretical amino acid of mass zero, and also a new enzyme
rule for trypsin can be created, which will recognize J and O as
cleavage sites. Details of the database entry structure are described
in Supplementary Methods.

LTQ-Orbitrap tandem mass spectrometry data from Helicobacter
pylori (data not shown) or Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37RV
whole-cell lysate samples were used to test the new databases. The
data of M. tuberculosis H37RV were analyzed using the clustered
database of annotated proteins from eight genomic sequences of
the M. tuberculosis complex (MTC) (see Supplementary Methods).
The original annotation of M. tuberculosis H37RV (Tuberculist) was
used as a reference. We have previously shown that for analysis
of M.tuberculosis H37RV proteins, the Tuberculist annotation
performed better than a posterior annotation provided by the TIGR
Institute (not used in this work), but some peptides only entered
in the secondary annotation were also found (de Souza et al.,
2008). The question is how much extra peptide information can be
obtained from M.tuberculosis H37RV using all genomic sequences
with annotations from MTC organisms. Supplementary Figure 1

Fig. 1. Identiﬁcation of MT3222 in M. tuberculosis H37Rv. A representative
MS/MS spectrum present in the M.tuberculosis H37Rv whole-cell lysate
sample. The fragmentation proﬁle matched a peptide (inset) with a Mascot
score of 108 derived from MT3222, a hypothetical protein annotated only in
the CDC1551, H37Ra and KZN-1435 genomes.

shows that the MTC database had 14% more protein entries and
24% more theoretical unique peptides (7—50 amino acids long)
as compared with the Tuberculist database (Supplementary File 1
lists all proteins and peptides from both databases). A larger MTC
database did not signiﬁcantly compromise the statistical validation
of the data with Mascot. By using MaxQuant (Cox and Mann, 2008)
for validation, the number of identiﬁed MS/MS events were very
similar at 1% false discovery rate. The MTC database identiﬁed
0.34% more peptides than the Tuberculist database, observed in
high—quality spectra.

The higher number of peptides identiﬁed by the MTC database
was expected to be caused by differences in the interpretation
of coding sequences. For example, Figure 1 illustrate an MS/MS
fragmentation pattern of ion m/z 1221.641, identiﬁed as peptide
MAVDVDQWPTVGQILPVVYSPK from entry MT3222 (from the
M. tuberculosis CDC1551 annotation) with a Mascot Score of 108
(score 24 indicated P <0.01), 0.32 p.p.m. mass accuracy and a
MaxQuant posterior error probability of 8.67E-36. This protein
entry is only annotated in the M.tuberculosis CDC1551, H37Ra
and KZN-1435 genomes, and it was identiﬁed with two peptides
covering 23.6% of the sequence. However, the gene coding region
is present in all eight genomes showing that the gene was simply not
annotated in ﬁve of the genomes. Similar observations of previously
unrecognized gene products in M. tuberculosis H37Rv are between
50 and 130 amino acids long (data not shown). This shows that gene
prediction tools may fail to correctly annotate small genes.

Additionally, peptides with minor sequence variations were also
successfully identiﬁed using the MTC database. For example, the
protein Rv0412c contains a peptide, INSDISVGNYR, with a SNP
that is speciﬁc to the M. tuberculosis H37Rv and H37Ra genomes.
Supplementary Figure 2 shows the MS/MS fragmentation pattern of
the peptide with a Mascot score of 72. In the remaining genomes,
the aspartic acid is replaced by tyrosine, and we also identiﬁed
this peptide in clinical isolate samples of M.tuberculosis (data
not shown). Peptides containing SNPs were also observed in the
H.pylori sample (data not shown).

In conclusion, multi-strain proteomic databases allow for identi-
ﬁcation of sequence variations between strains such as SNPs
and divergent TSSs, in addition to cover limitations of gene
annotations without compromising peptide redundancy and peptide
identiﬁcation rates. The application of this type of databases for
proteomic characterization of relevant clinical strains which have
not been sequenced is of interest.

MSMSpdbb and its source code are freely available at the
Microbial Proteomic Resource at http://0rg.uib.n0/pr0kary0tedb/
and can be modiﬁed to be used for other bacterial species
(instructions about software usage are given in Supplementary
Methods). We have applied MSMSpdbb for many different species
of clinical and industrial interest, generating both full translations
and annotated-only clustered databases. The full translation option
from MSMSpdbb can also be used on individual genomes in order
to be able to identify unannotated proteins. While full translation
databases of merged genomes are often very large and could
compromise statistical validation of the data, a full translation of
an individual genome can be used at almost no false positive cost
(de Souza et al., 2009). So far, we have available databases of 32
species, and updates are done on a weekly basis, with further species
being added. Already available databases are also updated when new
genome sequences are released. On request, MSMSpdbb users will
also be allowed to upload their databases.

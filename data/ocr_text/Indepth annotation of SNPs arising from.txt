ABSTRACT

Summary: NGS-SNP is a collection of command-line scripts for
providing rich annotations for SNPs identified by the sequencing
of whole genomes from any organism with reference sequences
in Ensembl. Included among the annotations, several of which
are not available from any existing SNP annotation tools, are the
results of detailed comparisons with orthologous sequences. These
comparisons can, for example, identify SNPs that affect conserved
residues, or alter residues or genes linked to phenotypes in another
species.

Availability: NGS-SNP is available both as a set of scripts and
as a virtual machine. The virtual machine consists of a Linux
operating system with all the NGS-SNP dependencies pre—installed.
The source code and virtual machine are freely available for download
at http://stothard.afns.ualberta.ca/downloads/NGS-SNP/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The latest sequencing instruments in conjunction with SNP
discovery tools can be used to identify huge numbers of putative
SNPs. Whether the SNPs are discovered through genome or
transcriptome sequencing the next problem after identiﬁcation is
often annotating and choosing functionally important SNPs. Here,
we describe a collection of scripts called NGS-SNP (next- generation
sequencing SNP), for performing in-depth annotation of SNPs
identiﬁed by popular SNP discovery programs such as Maq (Li et al.,
2008) and SAMtools (Li et al., 2009). NGS-SNP can be applied
to data from any organism with reference sequences in Ensembl,
and provides numerous annotation ﬁelds, several of which are not
available from other tools.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The main component of NGS-SNP is a Perl script called
‘annotate_SNPs.pl’ that accepts a SNP list as input and generates
as output a SNP list with annotations added (Table 1). Information
used for SNP annotation is retrieved from Ensembl (Hubbard
et al., 2009), NCBI (Maglott et al., 2011) and UniProt (UniProt
Consortium, 2011). Using a locally installed version of Ensembl

the annotation script can process 4 million SNPs in about 2 days
on a standard desktop system. Users analyzing many SNP lists,
from different individuals of the same species for example, can
take advantage of the script’s ability to create a local database of
annotation results. This database allows all the annotations and the
ﬂanking sequence for any previously processed SNPs to be obtained
much more quickly. Additional components of NGS-SNP include a
script for merging, ﬁltering and sorting SNP lists as well as scripts
for obtaining reference chromosome and transcript sequences from
Ensembl that can be used with SNP discovery tools such as Maq.
When the annotation script identiﬁes an amino acid—changing
SNP it calculates an ‘alignment score change’ value a. This process
involves comparing the reference amino acid and the non-reference
amino acid to each orthologue. Brieﬂy, the amino acid encoded
by the variant (i.e. non-reference) allele v is compared to each
available orthologous amino acid 0 using a log-odds scoring matrix
(BLOSUM62 by default). This provides a score s(v, 0) for each of the
n orthologues. Similarly, the amino acid encoded by the reference
allele r is compared to the orthologues. Any set of species in Ensembl
can be used as the source of orthologous sequences. The average
score for the reference amino acid is subtracted from the average
score for the variant amino acid (1), and the result is scaled to
between —1 and 1, by dividing by the maximum possible value for the
scoring matrix. A positive value indicates that the variant amino acid
is more similar to the orthologues than the reference amino acid,
whereas a negative value indicates that the reference amino acid is
more similar to the orthologues. SNPs with large positive or negative
values may be of more initial interest as candidates for further study.

The annotation script includes a ‘model’ option that can be used
to specify a well-studied species to use as an additional annotation
source. When a SNP is located near or within a gene, annotations
describing the model species orthologue of the gene are obtained
from Ensembl, Entrez Gene and UniProt. These annotations are used
to generate values that appear in a ‘Model_Ann0tations’ ﬁeld, in
the form of key-value pairs. Examples of information provided in
this ﬁeld include KEGG pathway names (Kanehisa et al., 2010),
the number of interacting proteins, phenotypes associated with the
orthologue, the names of protein features overlapping with the SNP
site in the orthologue, and phenotypes associated with mutations
affecting the SNP site in the orthologue. The sample output given
in Supplementary File 1 begins with the results for a contrived SNP
designed to change a residue in the bovine HBB protein, to resemble
a mutation responsible for sickle-cell disease in humans.

The annotation script can optionally provide the genomic ﬂanking

Known SNP sites in the ﬂanking sequence and at the SNP position
can be included in the output, as lowercase IUPAC characters in
the ﬂanking, and as potentially additional alleles at the SNP site.
Supplementary File 2 contains the ﬂanking sequences provided by

the annotation script (with known SNPs indicated in lowercase) for
the 10 SNPs described in Supplementary File 1.

3 DISCUSSION

Many existing SNP annotation tools work only for human SNPs or
SNPs already present in dbSNP, or can only be used to process
a few thousand SNPs at a time (Chelala et al., 2009; Johnson
et al., 2008; Schmitt et al., 2010). Apart from NGS-SNP we are
aware of two tools designed to annotate the very large SNP lists
generated by whole-genome resequencing of humans and non—
human species. ANN OVAR (Wang et al., 2010) is a command-line
tool that uses information from the UCSC Genome Browser to
provide annotations. Squnt (Shetty et al., 2010) is web-based
and can be downloaded, and also relies on resources from the
UCSC Genome Browser. Both can place SNPs into functional
classes, describe nearby genes, and indicate which SNPs are
already described in dbSNP. Neither compares affected residues
to orthologous sequences, reports overlapping protein features or
domains, provides gene ontology information, or provides ﬂanking
sequence. The ability to map SNP-altered residues to a protein
in another species to retrieve additional information is also not
supported. However, ANN OVAR and Squnt provide a measure
of DNA conservation at the SNP site, can handle indels, and return
annotations much more quickly than NGS-SNP. These features and
others give each tool some unique advantages. The option to submit
SNPs to Squnt online may be particularly appealing to some users.

In summary, NGS-SNP can be used to annotate the SNP
lists returned from programs such as Maq and SAMtools. SNPs
are classiﬁed as synonymous, non-synonymous, 3’-UTR, etc.,
regardless of whether or not they match existing SNP records.
Numerous additional ﬁelds of information are provided, several of
which are not available from other tools.

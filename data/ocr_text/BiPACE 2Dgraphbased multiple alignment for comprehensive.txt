ABSTRACT

Motivation: Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography-mass spec-
trometry is an established method for the analysis of complex mixtures
in analytical chemistry and metabolomics. It produces large amounts
of data that require semiautomatic, but preferably automatic handling.
This involves the location of significant signals (peaks) and their
matching and alignment across different measurements. To date,
there exist only a few openly available algorithms for the retention
time alignment of peaks originating from such experiments that
scale well with increasing sample and peak numbers, while providing
reliable alignment results.

Results: We describe BiPACE 2D, an automated algorithm for reten-
tion time alignment of peaks from 2D gas chromatography-mass
spectrometry experiments and evaluate it on three previously pub-
lished datasets against the MSPA, SWPA and GUINEU algorithms. We
also provide a fourth dataset from an experiment studying the H2
production of two different strains of Chlamydomonas reinhardtii that
is available from the MetaboLights database together with the experi-
mental protocol, peak-detection results and manually curated multiple
peak alignment for future comparability with newly developed
algorithms.

Availability and implementation: BiPACE 2D is contained in the freely
available Maltcms framework, version 1.3, hosted at http://maltcms.sf.
net, under the terms of the L-GPL v3 or Eclipse Open Source licenses.
The software used for the evaluation along with the underlying datasets
is available at the same location. The C.reinhardtii dataset is freely
available at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/metabolights/MTBLS37.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comprehensive 2D gas chromatography (GC x GC) has
developed into a defacto standard analytical technique to resolve
complex mixtures of volatile chemical compounds in various
areas of research. It is often used for the separation and charac-
terization of petrol and gasoline mixtures (Arey et al., 2005;

Munich, 85354 Freising, Germany.

Fraga et al., 2000; Johnson et al., 2004; Ventura et al., 2011;
von Muhlen et al., 2006). It couples two chromatographic
columns, with possibly different characteristics, to achieve an
improved separation of complex mixtures over one-dimensional
gas chromatography. However, identiﬁcation of analytes in
GC x GC with a one-dimensional detector such as a ﬂame ion-
ization detector is often limited to the use of retention index
calculations (Arey et al., 2005) and can be improved by coupling
a mass spectrometer to the chromatograph (GC x GC—MS). In
the ﬁeld of metabolomics, which studies the multitude of organic
molecules produced, modiﬁed and consumed by living organisms
(metabolites), both GC x GC and GC x GC—MS have been suc-
cessfully used to characterize and quantify volatile metabolites
in different organisms (Doebbe et al., 2010; Koek et al., 2011;
Pierce et al., 2006; Porter et al., 2006; Vial et al., 2009).

The variability of retention times (RTs) in both GC >< GC and
GC x GC—MS requires sophisticated algorithms for automatic
alignment of corresponding analyte signals between different
samples. Additionally, the size and number of acquired sample
data pose a signiﬁcant challenge to automated methods and
effectively prevent large-scale manual intervention by human
experts (Hoffmann and Stoye, 2012). Preprocessing of
GC x GC—MS data involves the ﬁltering and noise reduction of
the raw signal, the localization, deconvolution, integration and
normalization of analyte signals of interest (peaks) (Amador-
Munoz and Marriott, 2008), as well as downstream matching of
peaks to create a multiple alignment of related signals from dif-
ferent samples. Then, statistical methods like analysis of variance,
principal components analysis (Ventura et al., 2011), partial least
squares (Johnson et al., 2004) and variants thereof may be applied
to compare samples for signiﬁcant differences and similarities
within and between experimental factor groups. A more complete
overview of current data processing methods and programs for
GC x GC and GC x GC—MS data may be found in Matos et a].
(2012), Reichenbach et a]. (2012) and Kallio et a]. (2009).

In this article, a novel automated method for the multiple align-
ment of GC >< GC—MS peaks is introduced: bidirectional best-hit
peak assignment and clique extension for 2D chromatograms
(BiPACE 2D), which is based on comparing peak mass spectra
and RTs in two dimensions between a large number of samples.

2 METHODS

2.1 Peak alignment for GC x GC—MS

For GC >< GC-MS peak alignment, the mass spectrum behind each time
point on the 2D chromatographic plane can be used as an additional

criterion for peak similarity or identity. The use of electron ionization in
GC X GC-MS produces rich fragmentation spectra that are comparable
with ﬁngerprints of each analyte. However, electron ionization is known
to lead to identical or similar spectra (due to detector noise) for certain
classes of analytes, especially structural isomers. Thus, an additional cri-
terion for their distinction is required, such as the RT information of the
mass spectrum in the ﬁrst and second dimensions of separation. A peak
in GC X GC-MS may encompass many mass spectra, so that a reduction
to a representative mass spectrum is advisable for improved signal-to-
noise ratio and better spectral database search results (Oh et al., 2008). If
those results are reliable and return few false-positive identiﬁcations, one
can subsequently use the assigned names to associate peaks across sam-
ples. However, the results of database searches may consistently associate
a spectrum erroneously with an analyte that happens to be just above the
identiﬁcation threshold used by the database, whereas the true analyte is
missing from the database.

Typically, peaks should be aligned between samples that were mea-
sured under identical (homogeneous) separation conditions. However,
the algorithms of Jeong et a]. (2012), Kim et al. (2011b) and Wang
et a]. (2010) also support alignment of peaks that were measured under
different (heterogeneous) conditions (e. g. different temperature gradient)
that lead to non-linear shifts especially in the ﬁrst RT of the GC X GC
chromatogram.

The MSORT algorithm (Oh et al., 2008) sorts and associates peaks
based on their absolute RT difference for each separation dimension
and mass spectral similarity using Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.
It successively builds a sorted peak table created from unassigned peak
tables and matches peaks from a reference table, a search table with the
highest number of merged peaks, against the remaining peaks using a
sorting criterion until all searchable peaks have been processed.

The algorithm DISCO (Wang et al., 2010; Wei et a]. ,2013) uses land-
mark peaks in each sample that are mapped to landmark peaks in a
reference sample using Euclidean distance to calculate RT similarity
and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient to determine the similarity of mass
spectra. Based on the landmark peaks, the method determines a local
linear interpolation that is applied to non-landmark peaks, thereby cor-
recting for non-linear RT distortion.

Kim et al. (2011a,b) have introduced two different algorithms to ap-
proach the peak alignment problem in GC X GC-MS. The Smith-
Waterman peak alignment (SWPA) approach uses variants of dynamic
programming to ﬁnd a peak matching with maximal score for pairwise
alignments. Their mixture similarity peak alignment (MSPA) method
includes the optimization of a likelihood function based on a para-
meterized mixture similarity, which involves the dot product as mass
spectral similarity and RT deviation calculation with different distance
metrics. Both of their approaches extend the pairwise alignments transi-
tively to a multiple peak alignment, based on a prior chosen reference
peak list.

GUINEU (Castillo et al., 2011) uses the SCORE ALIGNMENT algorithm,
which is based on a combined score, using predeﬁned windows for ﬁrst
and second dimension RT deviations and retention index deviation. The
method scores neighboring peaks against potential target peak groups,
building candidate paths of related peaks. The weighted cosine product
is used to avoid alignment of mass spectra with low pairwise scores,
with a user-deﬁned minimum threshold. Path generation and evalu-
ation is performed in parallel and followed by a subsequent post-
processing phase, where peaks that were assigned to multiple groups
are reassigned to the peak group with highest score until all such conﬂicts
are resolved.

Jeong et al. (2012) use a statistical model to align the peaks, based on
pairwise peak scores calculated from mass spectral similarity (cosine
score) and RT deviation score functions. Their approach uses landmark
peaks with a high posterior probability according to their model to cal-
culate an RT correction for the remaining peaks, which fall below a

speciﬁc posterior probability threshold. They additionally calculate a cor-
rected RT for aligned peaks.

The BIPACE and BIPACE RT algorithms were introduced in
Hoffmann et a]. (2012), showing their applicability for peak alignment
of one-dimensional gas chromatography-mass spectrometry data.
BIPACE 2D is a novel extension of BIPACE that uses the 2D RT infor-
mation in addition to mass spectral similarity to align peaks across
multiple chromatograms without requiring a user-deﬁned reference
chromatogram.

2.2 BiPACE 2D pairwise peak similarity function

Given a chromatogram C = {171,192, ...,pg} as an ordered set of peaks,
we deﬁne a 2D peak p = (m, i, [1, 12) as a tuple of a mass vector m, an
intensity vector i, both with the same dimensions, a ﬁrst column RT 11
and a second column RT 12. For two peaks p and q, represented by their
binned mass spectral intensity vectors with ﬁrst column RTs [1, 1,, 11,51,
second column RTs 12m, 12,5, and RT tolerances of D1 and D2, for the
ﬁrst and second column, respectively, we deﬁne a similarity function
following Robinson et al. (2007) as follows:

2
_ (12,17 _ [2,1])

_ 2
M 2D2 )' 5(1): q): 
2

130107961) 2: exp<— 2D, )-exp<
where S(p,q) is an arbitrary similarity function between the mass spec-
tral intensity vectors, such as the cosine, the weighted cosine (Stein
and Scott, 1994), the dot product, Pearson’s linear correlation coefﬁ-
cient or Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient. The f2d(-, -) can be
interpreted as a likelihood function that independently scores the
proximity and mass spectral similarity of its arguments. It is max-
imized by peaks that have low deviation in RTs and a high mass
spectral score. The impact of deviations in either RT dimension can
be individually adjusted Via the RT tolerance parameters D1 and D2
of the Gaussian RT penalty terms, where a higher value allows for
larger RT deviations.

To prune the search space early during the pairwise all-against-all peak
similarity calculation phase of our algorithm, each RT penalty term has
an additional threshold parameter (T 1 and T 2, respectively) that allows to
effectively stop any further evaluation of f2d(-, -) if the value of the thresh-
old for that term is not attained or exceeded. Thus, the mass spectral
score function may not need to be evaluated at all, resulting in a large
speedup at the expense of reduced sensitivity toward peaks with larger
RT deviations.

2.3 Peak pair matching

Given K chromatograms C1, ..., CK, let S = (V,E) be a complete
K—partite, weighted graph with vertex set V = P1 U  U PK, where parti-
tion P,- consists of all peaks from chromatogram C,, and edge set E rep-
resents the similarity values between all peak pairs from different
chromatograms. Finding all peak groups with maximal pairwise similar-
ity in S is equivalent to enumerating all cliques of S, a problem that
relates to the classic NP—complete problem CLIQUE (Karp, 1972) with
a runtime exponential in the size of the input, in this case the number of
peaks.

Then, for each pair of peaks p e C and q e C’ from distinct chromato-
grams C and C’, the peak with highest similarity to p in C’, denoted q’,
and the peak with highest similarity to q in C, denoted p’, can be assigned
as bidirectional best hits (BBHs) of each other, if p = p’ and q = q’
(Overbeek et al., 1999). All peak similarities of p to other peaks in C’
and of q to other peaks in C are set to a minimum similarity value,
effectively removing the corresponding edge in S, whereas the similarities
of the BBHs p and q are retained.

2.4 Merging and multiple alignment construction

Based on the reduced set of BBHs, let V’ be the set of all vertices that are
part of at least one BBH and S’ = (V’,E’) the reduced K—partite BBH
graph with V’ as its vertex set and E’ as its unweighted BBH edge set.
The S’ has, by construction, a polynomial bound on the number of max-
imal cliques contained in it. These cliques can be enumerated in polyno-
mial time (Rosgen and Stewart, 2007).

Then, starting from the initial bicliques (the BBHs), the cliques in S’
are merged into larger cliques, if all peaks within the potential clique are
BBHs of each other. Otherwise, the largest peak group that is also a
clique is retained, whereas all peaks that are not BBHs of at least one
of the retained peaks in the group are removed. Merging is continued
until all cliques have been processed. After completion of the merging
phase, cliques with at least k peaks, as controlled by the minimum clique
size (MCS) parameter, are reported in a multiple alignment table, ordered
by their median RT. Peaks that are not included in any of the ﬁnal cliques
are optionally reported in the automated mass spectal deconvolution and
identiﬁcation system (AMDIS)—compatible mass spectral program (MSP)
format (Stein, 1999) with their mass spectrum, RT, originating ﬁle and a
unique ID for manual inspection.

Following Hoffmann et al. (2012), the time and space complexity of
BIPACE 2D and BIPACE are equivalent to 0(K262) in time and (9(K26)
in space, where K is the number of chromatograms and K the upper
bound of the number of peaks in each chromatogram. The lower asymp-
totic space complexity results from the BBH selection process that stores
for every peak in one chromatogram only its best corresponding peak in
every other chromatogram.

2.5 Reference dataset generation

To evaluate their 2D RT alignment algorithm MSPA, Kim et al. (2011b)
use the raw peak lists as created by the ChromaTOF software (LECO
Corp, St Joseph, MI, USA) and create reference multiple alignments
based on the assigned peak names. Because each peak list can contain
multiple peaks with the same name, the authors use a method to resolve
such potential conﬂicts by selecting the peak with the largest recorded
area as the representative for a group of otherwise identically named
peaks. This approach is referenced in the remainder of this article as
‘grouping by maximum area’ (GMA). As we have investigated, GMA
may lead to arbitrary and spurious assignments of peaks to the same
alignment row (with identical names across peak reports), hampering
the clear deﬁnition of what true and false positives as well as negatives are.
Examples of potentially problematic assignments for MSPA dataset I (see
Section 3.1 for details) are the compounds (naphthalene), (naphthalene,
2—methyl—), (anthracene), (benzo[ghi]perylene), (inden0[ I ,2,3-ca’]pyrene),
(phenol, pentachl0r0-) and (phenol, 2,3,5,6—tetrachl0r0-), all of which
appear to have been assigned the wrong name in a number of cases,
as is shown in Supplementary Figure S1 of Supplementary File S1.
Corresponding plots for the other datasets are available as
Supplementary Figures S2—S4 in the same supplementary ﬁle. The com-
plete data comparing the GMA reference creation approach to our pro-
posed approach for all datasets used in this work are contained in
Supplementary File S2 for each dataset.

2.5.] The M GMA approach To address the issues with the ap-
proach used by Kim et al. (2011b), the reference generation method
was modiﬁed to remove spurious assignments that relate back to poten-
tially false assignments of peak names by the ChromaTOF software. As
mentioned previously, additional problems may arise from the selection
process that relies solely on picking the peak with the largest area as the
representative for a group of identically named peaks within each report.

The new method ‘modiﬁed grouping by maximum area’ (MGMA)
calculates, for all equally named peaks (peak groups) in all peak reports,

the standard deviation of the RTs in the ﬁrst and second dimension of
separation.

For an arbitrary group of peaks P with the same name, x :2 o(t1(P))
and y :2 o(t2(P)) are deﬁned as the standard deviations of the peak
group RTs in the ﬁrst (t1) and second (t2) dimension of separation. An
elliptical function centered at x0 = 0 and yo = 0 and with a major radius
deﬁned by a (maximum allowed standard deviation for t1) and minor
radius deﬁned by 17 (maximum allowed standard deviation for t2) is then
used to calculate the decision criterion 2:

2: (36—360)2 +0} —)’0)2
a2 b2
If 2 g 1, the group is retained. Otherwise, if z> 1, the group at (x, y) is
outside of the bounds of the ellipse deﬁned by x0, yo, a, b and is marked as
a potential outlier group. The parameters used for a and b for the differ-
ent datasets examined in Section 3 are given in Table 1.

Peaks belonging to outlier groups are removed by MGMA without
further consideration, as a large deviation in one or both RT dimensions
may be a strong hint toward wrongly assigned peak names. An approach
to further discriminate the members of such groups may lead to add-
itional sources of false peak assignments and has thus not been con-
sidered at this stage.

Additionally, all peaks that occur only once throughout all peak re-
ports are removed, as they cannot provide any reliable grouping infor-
mation and may again have resulted from spurious identiﬁcations by
the vendor software due to different sample quality and/or non-optimal
parameter settings used during peak detection and putative peak
identiﬁcation.

The ﬁnal reference multiple alignment is then created using GMA on
the remaining peaks. MGMA thus reports a completely contained subset
of the original peaks as reported by GMA. An example for this is given in
Section 3.3.

2.6 Peak alignment performance evaluation

A reference alignment peak group deﬁnes whether a peak, represented by
its index in the original peak list, is present in a sample or absent. Each
column in the reference alignment corresponds to one sample’s peak list,
whereas each row represents an aligned peak group, spanning multiple
samples. The results of each alignment algorithm are tested against each
reference alignment group until either a match is found or the group is
reported to be non-assignable to a counterpart in the reference alignment.

If a reported peak group can be positively assigned, all of the group’s
peaks that are present in the corresponding reference alignment group are
counted as true positives (TP). Peaks that are absent in both the reference
and reported alignment peak group are counted as true negatives (TN).
A peak that is reported as absent in the reference alignment group, but as
present in the alignment algorithm’s reported group, is recorded as a false
positive (FP). A false negative (FN) is counted if a peak is present in the
reference alignment group but not reported by the alignment algorithm’s
corresponding peak group.

The following commonly applied measures are used to assess the
quality of a multiple alignment:

TP
P . . = —
rec1s10n TP + FF (3)

matched peaks of the reference alignment, excluding absent ones, are

added to the number of FN to normalize Recall and F1 score with respect
to the size of the reference alignment.

We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of our row-wise multiple
alignment evaluation over the pairwise alignment evaluation as used by
Kim et al. (2011a,b) in Supplementary File S1. In the remainder of this
work, we refer to the value of the average F1 score based on pairwise
alignment evaluation for each algorithm parameterization as F1 1,.
Differences in the resulting numbers for F1p to the numbers published
in Kim et al. (2011a) are due to the evaluation scheme that we use. We
compare all possible unique pairwise combinations of alignment column
pairs against the corresponding reference alignment columns. Thus, our
absolute TP, FP, TN and FN numbers are higher, and the F11, tends to
be generally lower.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The GNU R scripts available with Kim et al. (2011a,b) were
carefully adapted to be able to run them within an automated
evaluation pipeline. The MSPA and SWPA dataset peak lists
were used unaltered as input to all evaluated programs, keeping
peaks that were split across multiple modulations, while remov-
ing peak artifacts with an identical area. To make the gap-less
multiple alignment output of MSPA and SWPA comparable with
the gapped multiple alignment of BIPACE 2D, we modiﬁed the
corresponding R-code to not remove incomplete peak groups.
GUINEU was modiﬁed to parse the ChromaTOF peak ﬁle format
with separate ﬁelds for ﬁrst and second column RTs and was
further adapted to run without a graphical user interface and to
record the original row index of each peak in the original peak
list for later evaluation.

The algorithms BIPACE, BIPACE RT and BIPACE 2D were
evaluated against GUINEU’s score alignment (Castillo et al.,
2011), MSPA (Kim et al., 2011a) and its variants PAD, PAS,
DW-PAS, SW-PAD and PAM, as well as against SWPA (Kim
et al., 2011b) and its variants SWRM, SWRE, SWRME and
SWRME2. The MSPA, SWPA and GUINEU methods used the
ChromaTOF peak lists as input directly. For the BIPACE meth-
ods, we converted the ChromaTOF peak lists to a backwards
compatible extended netCDF format (Rew and Davis, 1990),
supporting ﬁrst and second column elution time. BIPACE also
supports szL input ﬁles (Martens et al., 2011), containing the
standardized spectrum attributes ﬁrst_c0lamn_elati0n_time and
second_colamn_elati0n_time. The parameterizations reported as
optimal by both the OP-PAM and the likelihood-based param-
eter optimization for the SWPA methods were explicitly included

in the evaluation for each of the respective methods. The results
for the MSPA SW-PAD variant using Pearson’s correlation
between spectra and Euclidean distance for RT matching corres-
pond to the results of the DISCO algorithm (Kim et al., 2011a).
A detailed overview of the best results for each dataset and
variant is available in Supplementary Tables S1—S4 of
Supplementary File S1. Each algorithm was run and evaluated
for a range of different parameter values. The user-conﬁgurable
parameters (penalty terms, mass spectral score function, RT dis-
tance function) for MSPA and SWPA were taken from the cor-
responding publications (Kim et al., 2011a,b). We tested all
Viable combinations of score function (dot product, linear cor-
relation) and RT distance functions (Manhattan, Euclidean,
Canberra, Maximum). Kim and Zhang (2013) provide a recent
comparison of MSPA using an additional set of similarity func-
tions that were not evaluated here. For BIPACE and its variants,
the varied parameters included the mass spectral score function,
RT penalty terms (BIPACE RT and BIPACE 2D) and RT pen-
alty threshold (BIPACE RT and BIPACE 2D). The parameter
values for all methods are available for each dataset individually
within Supplementary File S2. Plots of the runtime and memory
usage of each parameterized method are included in
Supplementary File S1. They reﬂect only the peak alignment
phase, not the data import and ﬁltering phases of the algorithms.

3.1 MSPA datasets

The authors of the MSPA publication (Kim et al., 2011a) eval-
uated their algorithms on two different datasets. The ﬁrst one,
here termed MSPA dataset I, consists of 10 samples of 106 stand-
ard compound mixtures, measured throughout with the same
temperature gradient. It contains 1672 peaks in total, of which
752 in 81 rows were used in the GMA reference alignment. These
were further reduced to 592 peaks in 64 rows by MGMA.

The second dataset, MSPA dataset II, contains ﬁve samples of
rat plasma with spiked-in 6—compound standards, also measured
under identical temperature gradient conditions. The original
peak reports contained 3575 peaks. These were reduced
to 1682 peaks in 493 rows by GMA’s reference alignment gen-
eration, and further reduced by MGMA to 1081 peaks in
320 rows.

Table 1 holds the parameters used to generate the MGMA
reference alignments, for MSPA dataset I and MSPA dataset II,
respectively.

3.1.] Results for MSPA Dataset I Figure 1 shows the F1 score
obtained for each of the methods under consideration, against
both GMA and MGMA reference alignments. For both refer-
ences, BIPACE 2D achieves the highest F1 scores (0.9296 for
GMA and 0.9472 for MGMA reference), followed by BIPACE
RT (0.9181 and 0.9322). The GUINEU (0.9082 and 0.9165) and
MSPA-PAM (0.905 and 0.9169) variants follow closely behind.
BIPACE 2D also has a consistently better precision value (0.9551
and 0.9607) than any of the other methods. On both references,
the best BIPACE 2D instance uses RT penalty parameters of
D1 = 10, D2 = 0.5, M CS=2, the dot product as mass spectral
similarity and RT penalty thresholds of T1 = 0 and T 2 = 0.99,
effectively allowing only small differences in the second dimen-
sion RT. BIPACE 2D also achieves the best average pairwise F1 p

better than any GUINEU, MSPA or SWPA variant (Figure 2). The

instance on the GMA reference also achieves the highest
Flp value (0.6857 :l: 0.0264) with parameters D1 = 25,
D2 = 0.5, MCS = 2 and RT penalty thresholds of T1 = 0.75
and T2 = 0, effectively allowing only small differences in the
ﬁrst dimension RT, whereas allowing larger differences in the
second dimension RT. BIPACE RT scores the highest Flp
value of 0.8231 :l: 0.0201 on the MGMA reference with
D=30, T209 and MCS=2. The F1 and Flp values for
GUINEU, MSPA and the SWPA variants do not fall far behind
in this case on either reference alignment in comparison with the
other datasets (see Supplementary File S1, Section 4 for more
details).

3.2 SWPA dataset

The SWPA publication (Kim et al., 2011b) used two different
datasets for evaluation purposes. However, SWPA dataset II
(spiked-in) was excluded from this evaluation because it was
identical to MSPA dataset II. SWPA dataset I is a combination
of 16 samples, measured using three different temperature gradi-
ents. Therefore, it should be a signiﬁcant challenge for RT-based
algorithms. The dataset originally contained 2499 peaks, which
were reduced to 1201 peaks in 83 alignment rows by GMA, and
to 1090 peaks in 75 rows by MGMA. The parameters for the
MGMA reference alignment are given in Table l.

Fig. 3. F1 score for all parameterizations of the evaluated algorithms for
SWPA dataset I. MSPA-PAM, MSPA-PAS and MSPA-SW-PAD perform
better than the BIPACE, SWPA and GUINEU variants

considering F1 score, with values of 0.8366 (GMA reference) and
0.8517 (MGMA reference). The best GUINEU instance achieves
values of 0.7061 and 0.7148, whereas the best BIPACE instance
achieves F1 values of 0.6966 and 0.7136, respectively. More de-
tails are shown in Figure 3. Considering the F1 p score, the order
is unchanged, with MSPA-PAM achieving 0.7942 :l: 0.0914
and 0.8101 :l: 0.0882, GUINEU scoring 0.5142 :l: 0.314 and
0.529:l:0.309 and BIPACE trailing with 0.4772:l:0.248 and
0.4995 :l: 0.2479, on GMA and MGMA references.

The comparatively low F1 score for all BIPACE variants can
be explained by many peaks that are reported as being absent,
while they are present in either reference alignment. Those absent
peaks are counted as FNs and thus lead to a low Recall value
(Supplementary File S1, Section 5). However, the BIPACE vari-
ants perform better when considering TN and FP values. They
report fewer peaks per peak group, resulting in a more conser-
vative alignment when compared with either the MSPA or SWPA
variants, at the expense of more TPs.

BIPACE achieves high precision values for either reference
(0.9049 and 0.9146), but lacks in Recall (0.5174 and 0.5397),
leading to the comparatively low F1 and Flp scores, whereas
BIPACE 2D has slightly lower precision values (0.8588 and
0.8631) but higher Recall (0.5841 and 0.607). Detailed numbers

3.3 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii dataset

The C.reinhardtii dataset (CHLAMY dataset I) was originally ana-
lyzed in Doebbe et al. (2010). The experiment explored the dif-
ference in H2 production yield between the C.reinhardtii wild-
type strain cc406 (WT) and the high H2-producing strain
Stm6Glc4 (MUT) at two different time points, namely, before
(T1) and during (T2) the H2 production phase, with three repli-
cates for each of the factor combinations WT-Tl, WT-T2,
MUT-Tl, MUT-T2, yielding a total of 12 samples. For this art-
icle, the stored original samples of that experiment were prepared
according to the protocol in Doebbe et al. (2010) and then rea-
nalyzed using a LECO Pegasus 4D time-of-ﬂight mass spectrom-
eter (LECO, St Joseph, MI, USA). The Pegasus 4D system was
equipped with an Agilent 6890 gas chromatograph (Agilent,
Santa Clara, CA, USA).

3.3.] Sample acquisition Splitless injection of 1 ul sample
volume was conducted at 275°C injector temperature. The gas
chromatograph was equipped with a 30 m X 0.25 mm X 0.25 pm
ﬁhn thickness, Rtx-5 ms (Restek Corp., Bellefonte, PA, USA)
capillary column used as the primary column and a BPX—50
(SGE Incorporated, Austin, TX, USA) 2m X 0.1 mm X 0.1 pm
capillary column used as the secondary column. The temperature
program of the primary oven was set to the following conditions:
70°C for 2min, 4°C/min to 180°C, 2°C/min to 230°C and 4°C/
min to 325°C hold 3min. The temperature program of the sec-
ondary oven was set with an offset of 15°C to the primary oven
temperature. The thermal modulator was set 30°C relative to the
primary oven and used a modulation time of 5 s with a hot pulse
time of 0.4 s. The mass spectrometer ion source temperature was
set to 200°C, and the ionization was performed at —70 eV. The
detector voltage was set to 1600V and mass spectra were
recorded at 200 scans/second using a scanning range of
50—750 m/z.

3.3.2 Sample processing The samples were processed automat-
ically by the LECO ChromaTOF software v.4.22 at a signal-
to-noise ratio of 100. The baseline offset was 0.8 and the two
peak widths were set to 0.2 s (as measured from baseline to base-
line) and 15 s (ﬁrst dimension). By using the classiﬁcation feature
of the software, background peaks originating from column
bleed or solvent tailing were removed.

Analytes were putatively identiﬁed by database searches using
the Golm Metabolome Database, version 20100614 (Hummel
et al., 2007). The minimum required similarity threshold for
assignment of a compound name was set to 600. The original
ChromaTOF peak lists contained a total of 31 695 peaks for the
12 samples. All peaks with best matching library spectrum simi-
larity <600, ﬂagged as ‘Unknown’, were removed from further
consideration. The original peak lists were exported from
ChromaTOF using one ﬁeld [R.T. (s)] for the ﬁrst and second
column elution time. Therefore, we introduced two separate col-
umns for ﬁrst and second column elution time (‘lst Dimension
Time (s)’ and ‘2nd Dimension Time (s)’) to make them suitable
as input to both MSPA and SWPA.

GMA, MGMA and manual multiple alignment reference generation

The resulting peak lists for each sample were further rectiﬁed
by removing all peaks with unclear Gohn Metabolome Database
identiﬁcations containing an ‘NA’. These steps were required to
make the peak lists compatible to MSPA’s and SWPA’s peak
merging preprocessing step, which was needed for the generation
of the evaluation reference alignments with GMA and MGMA.
These unknowns would otherwise have lead to false peak group
assignments based on the peaks’ non-unique names. The removal
of ‘Unknown’ peaks and rectiﬁcation of ‘NA’s reduced the
number of peaks to a total of 4860. The ﬁnal GMA reference
alignment contained 2723 peaks in 369 rows, whereas the
MGMA reference, using the parameters given in Table 1, con-
tained 1629 peaks in 224 rows.

3.3.3 Manual reference To deﬁne the manual reference align-
ment, the reduced peak lists without ‘Unknown’s and ‘NA’s were
inspected and only peaks were kept that could be positively
conﬁrmed by assigned name and RTs within two of the three
samples within each factor combination of the experiment. For a
number of unclear cases, we additionally compared the mass
spectra of the questionable peaks manually to check for
common characteristic mass fragments. The ﬁnal manual refer-
ence alignment contained 436 peaks grouped into 68 distinct
rows.

The overlap of the three reference multiple alignments is Visua-
lized in Figure 4. As expected, the MGMA reference is a perfect
subset of the GMA reference. More interestingly, there is a large
overlap of the manual reference with the automated methods’
reference alignments, supporting the claim that these automated
methods for reference generation based on the assigned com-
pound names capture most of the peak alignments contained
in the manual reference alignment. A small proportion of
28 peaks (6.4% of peaks in the manual reference) occurs exclu-
sively within the manual alignment and not within any of the
automated methods. Of these, 24 peaks were differently assigned
in the automated methods versus the manual reference, whereas
four peaks were not reported at all by those methods. In all,
149 peaks were found missing from the manual reference in com-
parison with the GMA reference generation method, due to the
stricter selection criteria that were used to exclude potential FP
peak assignments.

The manual reference alignment, the peak reports for each
sample as exported from ChromaTOF and the raw data ﬁles
in netCDF format are available as dataset MTBLS37 from the
MetaboLights database (Haug et al., 2013).

Fig. 5. F1 score for all parameterizations of the evaluated algorithms for
CHLAMY dataset I. BIPACE 2D performs clearly better than any of the
other methods using the dot product as pairwise similarity between mass
spectra

3.3.4 Results for CHLAMY dataset I All three BIPACE variants
using either the cosine or Pearson’s linear correlation as similarity
functions between mass spectra perform better than either
GUINEU, MSPA or SWPA variant (Figure 5). BIPACE 2D achieves
F1 scores of 0.6692 (GMA reference), 0.7662 (MGMA reference)
and 0.7429 (MANUAL reference), with D1 = 100, D2 = 0.5,
thresholds T1 = 0.99 and T2 = 0.99, together with an MCS
value of 2. The F1 values are Visualized in Figure 5. BIPACE
2D also achieves the highest Recall values of 0.5752 (GMA),
0.7079 (MGMA) and 0.7596 (MANUAL), whereas still maintain-
ing reasonable values for Precision between 0.72 and 0.835
(Supplementary File S1, Section 6). The considerably low values
for Recall achieved by the different methods may be due to the
complexity of the biological samples and the large number of
closely related peaks and associated peak areas. The best average
pairwise F1 p scores are also achieved by BIPACE 2D
(GMA: 0.7198 :l: 0.0335, MGMA: 0.8293 :l: 0.0247, MANUAL:
0.864 :l: 0.0606), with GUINEU (GMA: 0.6434 :l: 0.0419, MGMA:
0.7766 :l:0.0338, MANUAL: 0.8481 :l:0.0528) placing second
and different MSPA variants placing third (GMA, MSPA-PAM:
0.5976 :l: 0.1283, MGMA, MSPA-DWPAS: 0.6907 :l: 0.1296,
MANUAL, MSPA-SW-PAD: 0.7475 :l: 0.1741).

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

We have introduced BIPACE 2D, an algorithm and software for
RT alignment of peak data from GC X GC—MS experiments. It
is implemented in the platform-independent Java programming
language and aligns peak data in vendor-independent formats,

such as szL (Martens et al., 2011) or netCDF. ChromaTOF
peak lists can be converted to netCDF ﬁles using the software
Maui (also available at http://maltcms.sf.net).

We have shown that BIPACE 2D is a competitive algorithm
that is able to achieve better precision and recall, as well as F1
and average pairwise F1 p score values in comparison with MSPA,
SWPA and GUINEU on three of the four evaluated datasets.
These three datasets were all acquired under homogeneous con-
ditions, whereas the dataset where BIPACE 2D did not outper-
form MSPA and GUINEU was acquired under heterogeneous
conditions. Thus, BIPACE 2D should ideally be applied to
data acquired under the same conditions, but due to its low
FP rate, it may still be a valid alternative for data acquired
under heterogeneous conditions as well. Concerning the param-
eters for BIPACE 2D, the weighted cosine appears to be the most
sensitive mass spectral similarity and should therefore be used as
the default. The M CS parameter was set to the minimum size of
two in all evaluated parameterizations, thus leading to all cliques
being reported by BIPACE and its variants. The D1 and D2
parameters should be set according to the expected RT standard
deviation of the samples under comparison, in separation dimen-
sions one and two, respectively. Finally, the threshold parameters
T 1 and 72 allow for ﬁne-tuning of the sensitivity of the algo-
rithm, where higher values exclude potential matches earlier
during the pairwise similarity calculation phase of BIPACE. It
is further notable that BIPACE 2D was on average 3—10 times
faster than any of the MSPA or SWPA variants for the larger and
more complex datasets (SWPA dataset I and CHLAMY dataset I,
see Supplementary File S1 for details), while consuming less
memory. GUINEU achieved comparable speed but required
more memory. We have demonstrated the applicability of
BIPACE 2D to small datasets with a few compounds, as well
as to larger datasets with hundreds to suspected thousands of
different compounds. BIPACE’s pairwise similarity calculation
can be run in parallel using multiple CPU cores to speed up its
runtime. It has been successfully tested on 250 ﬁles containing
100 000 peaks on commodity hardware within 9 GB of random
access memory. This qualiﬁes BIPACE 2D as a good candidate
for automated medium to high-throughput applications in the
ﬁeld of metabolomics and analytical chemistry.

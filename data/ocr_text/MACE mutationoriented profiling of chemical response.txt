Abstract

Summary: The mutational status of specific cancer lineages can affect the sensitivity to or resist—
ance against cancer drugs. The MACE database provides web—based interactive tools for interpret—
ing large chemical screening and gene expression datasets of cancer cell lines in terms of mutation
and lineage categories. Gl50 data of chemicals against individual NCI60 cell lines were normalized
and organized to statistically identify mutation— or lineage—specific chemical responses. Similarly,
DNA microarray data on NCI60 cell lines were processed to analyze mutation— or lineage—specific
gene expression signatures. A combined analysis of Gl50 and gene expression data to find poten—
tial associations between chemicals and genes is also a capability of this system. This database
will provide extensive, systematic information to identify lineage— or mutation—specific anticancer

agents and related gene targets.

Availability and implementation: The MACE web database is available at http://mace.sookmyung.

1 Introduction

Various drug responses are induced by somatic mutations in cancers.
Approaches to the analysis of gene functions related to drug sensitiv—
ity are becoming a popular strategy for overcoming drug resistance
and for predicting drug sensitivity (Tan, et 61]., 2010). Some efforts
have focused on the lineage—dependent association between cell lines
and drug response (Amatschek, et 61]., 2004; Dawany and Tozeren,
2010) and the identification of mutation—dependent compound sen—
sitivity (He, et 61]., 2013a; Kim, et al., 2012). Currently, many small
molecule databases have been developed, including several of the
following databases: chemical information with biological activity
and target information (Hastings, et 61]., 2013; Law, et 61]., 2014;
Seiler, et 61]., 2008), chemical search engines with a variety of chem—
informatics tools (Chen, et 61]., 2007; Goede, et 61]., 2005; Hsin,

et 61]., 2011; Masciocchi, et 61]., 2009), and chemical information
with extended response profiles on biological samples (Schmidt,
et al., 2009; Wang, et 61]., 2014). Most of these databases are
focused on the collection of chemical information, not organized for
quantitative analysis. Some studies integrating drug response with
genomic data have been established on a plentiful of cell lines, but
for limited numbers of chemicals (Barretina, et 61]., 2012; Garnett,
et 61]., 2012). Thus, we developed a web—based database, MACE
(Mutation—oriented Analysis of Chemical response and gene
Expression), to provide mutation— or lineage-oriented profiling of
chemical response and gene expression on a wide variety of cancer
cell lines from NCI60 datasets.

The NCI60 by the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP)
of NCI/NIH provides anticancer compound screening data for

Fig. 1. Distribution of lineages and mutations in NCI60 cell lines

NCI60 cancer cell lines. The quantified response data, G150—the
concentration that inhibits growth by 50%, are available for more
than 50,000 chemical compounds (Scudiero, et 61]., 1988). This re—
source can be used to find relationships among compound structure,
mechanism of action, cell lineage, and tumor mutations (He and
Yoon, 2012). The NCI60 cell lines represent nine cancer lineage
types (breast, CNS—central nervous system, colon, leukemia, mel-
anoma, lung, ovarian, prostate and renal). MACE includes top 15
most frequently mutated genes which are found in more than 4 cell
lines (TP53, CDKNZA, PTEN, KRAS, BRAF, PIK3CA, APC,
c—MYC-Amp, STK11, CTNNBl, SMAD4, RB1, MLH1, NRAS and
TN_stromal) (Figure 1). Mutations in these genes are known to be
involved in cancer—related cellular pathways. TP5 3 is a tumor
suppressor, and somatic mutations in TP53 are the most common
genetic changes found in human cancer (Olivier, et 61]., 2010).
Defects in the gene cyclin—dependent kinase inhibitor 2A (CDKN2A)
is involved in the genesis of many tumor types (Sulong, et 61]., 2009).
PTEN is a tumor suppressor, and PIK3CA is an oncogene. These
proteins make up the PTEN—PI3K signaling pathway, which is
involved in the regulation of many cancer related pathways
(Carracedo and Pandolfi, 2008). KRAS, NRAS and BRAF are onco-
genes involved in the ErbB signaling pathway, which mediates cell
growth and malignant transformation through kinase pathway acti—
vation (Brose, et 61]., 2002). APC is a tumor suppressor, and
CTNNB1 is an oncogene. Mutations in these genes cause defects
in Wnt signaling (Polakis, 2012). High expression of the oncogene
c—MYC (c—MYC—Amp) and mutational inactivation of the tumor
suppressor RB1 cause dysregulation of cell cycle control (Lin, et 61].,
2012). STK11 has been identified as a tumor suppressor involved in
the development of cancer, especially in lung cancer (Sanchez-
Cespedes, et 61]., 2002). Mutation of SMAD4 results in disruption of
TGFbeta signaling and occurs frequently in association with malig-
nant progression (Miyaki and Kuroki, 2003). Genetic mutation of
MLH1 is associated with colon cancer risk (Bonadona, et 61]., 2011),
and activated expression of TN_stromal is related to human breast
cancer (Ishihara, et 61]., 1995).

MACE provides tools for 1) category—based analysis of chemical
response or gene expression in cancer cell lines (Table 1), 2) finding
a correlation between chemical response and gene expression on
NCI60 cell lines, and 3) 2D— or 3D—based chemical structural
searches in real—time. The term “category” refers to mutational or
lineage groups of cell lines, and thus “a specific category” indicates
a specific mutation or lineage (e.g. BRAF or lung).

2 MACE overview

The overall data preprocessing and data flow of MACE are depicted
in Figure 2. We collected chemical response and gene expression
data for NCI60 cell lines, and chemical structure information as the

For the 50 839 chemicals (75 446 records) and the 54 613 gene probes, the
three types of proﬁles are analyzed. Note that the cell line MDA-MB—468 is
excluded. Data are obtained as follows: i) z-score by normalization of
—logG150, ii) logz (gene expression) by logz transformation of RMA normal-
ization, iii) fold change and log (fold change) by subtracting the median of
all cell lines from the average of in-category cell lines based on z-score and
log (gene expression), respectively.

primary dataset. NCI60 drug response data were obtained from the
NCI DTP (http://dtp.nci.nih.gov). The latest version, released in
2012, contains 50,839 compounds (75,446 records) with negative
log—transformed G150 values to characterize sensitivity across
NCI60 cancer cell lines. The distribution pattern of average —log
GI50 values for total chemicals are displayed in Supplementary
Figure 1. The figure shows that NCI60 response data were biased in
leukemia cell lines. To eliminate this bias, z—score normalization was
used against individual cell lines. Furthermore, microarray gene
expression data for the NCI60 cancer cell lines were obtained from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.
gov/geo/) dataset series GSE32474 (Pfister, et 61]., 2009). This data—
set was derived from 174 arrays performed in triplicate for NCI60
cancer cell lines. The experiments were carried out with the
Affymetrix U133 Plus 2.0 Array chip, which includes 54,613 probes.
The data were normalized using a Robust Multi—array Average
(RMA) algorithm (Irizarry, et 61]., 2003). In brief, the data prepro—
cessing includes normalization of the primary data, organization
of category—oriented profiles, building 2D structure and 3D shape
databases for chemicals, and calculation of cross correlation
between chemicals, between genes, and between chemicals and
genes.

MACE provides multiple query methods for chemical profiles
using simple text (including chemical name, NSC ID—the NCI’s
internal ID number, and CAS number) or structure, and for gene
expression profiles, both gene symbol and gene probe ID are used
(Figure 3). A simple text search for a chemical retrieves a particular
chemical structure and its information. The structure search has op—
tions to select 2D structure— and 3D shape—based similarity searches
for a chemical structure drawn via the structure editor. In addition,
groups of structures can be searched by filtering chemicals satisfying
user—defined criteria in terms of response difference and statistical
significance in a specific category. Likewise, groups of genes can
also be retrieved by filtering genes satisfying user—defined
conditions.

From the retrieved results, three types of profiles are available
for both datasets: mutation—based, lineage—based, and cell line—based
profiles (Table 1). For each profile, the data are visualized as three
types of graphs including a bar graph, a heatmap, and a waterfall
graph (Figure 4).

category compared to all cell lines. For a given chemical, the fold
change was calculated by subtracting the median z—score of all cell
lines to the average z—score of in—category cell lines (see Table 1).
Likewise, for a given gene, the log2(fold change) was calculated
by subtracting the median log2(gene expression) of all cell lines to
the average log2(gene expression) of in—category cell lines. A t—test

P—value is used to evaluate the statistical significance of the fold
change. In addition, we also calculated enrichment scores using an
odds ratio between the observed odds and the expected odds to de—
scribe specificity. The observed odds is the ratio of the number of
cell lines with a significant difference (fold change>1 and P < 0.01)
in a specific category to the number of all cell lines in that category.

Fig. 4. Mutation-oriented analysis of chemicals and gene expression.
Examples of mutation-based profiles (A—C) for a chemical, selumetinib (NSC
ID: 741078) and (D-F) for a gene, TYR (probe ID: 1555504_at), are displayed.
(A, D) Bar graphs for each mutation (P<0.01 as indicated by red colored
bars). (B, E) Heatmap display for mutation categories. (C, F) Waterfall graphs
for BRAF-mutant cell lines compared with other cell lines. The horizontal axis
represents all cell lines sorted by the y-axis value and the red dots indicate
the cell lines with the BRAF mutation

The expected odds is the ratio of cell lines with significant differ-
ences (fold change>1 and P < 0.01) among the NCI60 cell lines.

For example, the chemical selumetinib can be retrieved by typing
its name or NSC ID, 741078 (Figure 3). Then, from the chemical
structure information, one of three profiles can be selected.
Examples of mutation—based profiles are shown in Figure 4. At first,
the profile is displayed in a bar graph (Figures 4A). The bar graphs
show the response difference for each of 15 mutations. In the graph,
the names of mutant genes are listed on the x—axis and the chemical
response is represented on the y—axis in terms of fold change (i.e.,
difference of normalized —log G150 between a mutant subgroup and
all cell lines). The red bar in the graph indicates a significance level
(P value) less than 0.01 in the corresponding mutation group.
Multiple bar graphs per chemical may be shown if there are redun—
dant experiments for the given chemical. In the next step, all profiles
are clustered and displayed in the form of a heatmap (Figures 4B).
For selumetinib, there were three repeated experiments, which con—
sistently show BRAF and SMAD4 sensitivity among 15 mutations.
Clicking the bar graph or any row on the heatmap will direct to
waterfall graphs. For mutation—based profiles, 15 waterfall graphs
for 15 mutant genes are displayed. In this example, the waterfall
graph for BRAF is shown in Figure 4C. In each waterfall graph, the
response difference and the enrichment score are shown with each
corresponding significance level. For another example, the TYR

gene, a similar analysis can be performed. The gene symbol
TYR is mapped to three gene probes in the microarray dataset.
The expression difference of TYR is represented in terms of log2
(fold change) for 15 mutations. TYR overexpression is highly associ—
ated with BRAF mutation (Figure 4D). Heatmap shows that all of
three TYR probes consistently exhibit high expression in BRAF mu-
tant cell lines (Figure 4E). In the waterfall graph of Figure 4F, cell
lines with BRAF mutation (red dots) are highly enriched for the ex—
pression of the TYR gene.

Similarly, for lineage-based profiles, the same format of the data
for each of 9 lineages will be shown for chemical response and
gene expression. MACE also displays category—free bar graphs
and heatmaps for all cell lines. In the case of cell line—based profiles,
no waterfall graphs are provided.

4 2D and 3D similarity searches

MACE provides two types of similarity search for chemicals:
2D similarity calculated from structure fingerprints and 3D shape
similarity based on volume matches. MACE supports similarity,
substructure and superstructure searches for 2D structures against
over 48,000 chemical structures. For 2D structure—based similarity
searches, the query and the target structures are encoded into mo—
lecular fingerprints in the FP2 format using OpenBabel (O’Boyle,
et al., 2011). A 2D structure fingerprint is comprised of bit string
(a sequence of 0’s and 1’s) to denote the presence of a particular
substructure in a molecule. The 2D similarity is measured using the
Tanimoto score which quantifies topological similarity of chemical
bonding and atomic constitution in the range of 0 to 1. Chemicals
with a degree of similarity 0.5 or more will be retrieved in MACE.
The substructure and superstructure searches locate chemical struc—
tures that contain particular substructures and superstructures of
a query chemical, respectively. For 3D shape—based similarity
searches, the 3D conformer database has been built using OMEGA
(Hawkins and Nicholls, 2012), which consists of up to 2.1 million
conformers for ~48,000 chemicals. The maximum number of con—
formers per chemical was 200 for the 3D conformer database and
50 for a query, and the RMSD cutoff between conformers was
0.5  The 3D shape search runs on high—end commodity GPU hard-
ware to enable real—time shape similarity calculations. The 3D simi-
larity measure, TanimotoCombo, is the sum of shape and color
Tanimotos ranging from 0 to 2 implemented in FastROCS
(Hawkins, et al., 2007). The most similar 100 conformers for a
query chemical are returned as hits.

The 2D and 3D similarity searches are available via the structure
editor (Figure 5A). MarvinSketch is used for the structure editor,
which is developed by ChemAxon (http://www.chemaxon.com).
Users can draw or load structures and execute one of two searches.
Figure 5 shows some of the selected chemicals with the highest simi-
larity range from the results of 2D and 3D searches for a single
query chemical. For the retrieved chemicals of the search, all three
types of profiles and three formats of graphs are available as well.
In the present example, while 2D and 3D searches retrieve different
types of chemicals, they consistently exhibit a significant sensitivity
for PIK3 CA mutant cell lines. The results also show similar patterns
in the heatmaps of mutation—based profiles.

5 Profile-based similarity search

Another functionality of MACE is combinational analysis of drug
response and gene expression data. Cross correlation analysis is

Fig. 5. 2D and 3D chemical search powered by GPU machine. (A) After drawing or loading a chemical in the given structure editor, clicking the 2D-based or the
3D-based shape search button will return the summary of hit chemicals and their cellular response data in three profile types. Examples of 2D and 3D search
results for a query chemical are shown in (B, C), respectively, in the order of chemical structure and mutation-based response profiles in bar graphs and

heatmaps

available via profile—based similarity search. MACE searches chem—
icals/genes with similar profiles by comparison of cell line—based
profiles between all pairs of chemicals and genes. Though CellMiner
provides similarity analysis among drug response, gene and
microRNAs expression values, the result shows gene/drug list and
Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) values (Reinhold, et al.,
2012). MACE presents a heatmap of all results and makes the
results more clear. The profile—based similarity measure is based on
absolute PCC on all cell lines. Chemicals or genes with a correlation
value 2 0.6 and a P—value < 0.01 will be returned. Users can start
the search from the heatmap of the cell line—based profiles. For the
query chemical, the heatmap of cell line—based profiles and two
search buttons are shown in the top in Figure 6. Selecting one profile
on the heatmap first and clicking one type of search will retrieve cell
line—based profiles of hits with profile—based similarity measures
(absolute PCC) in bar graph format. An example of hits from similar
chemical and gene searches are shown in the middle and in the bot—
tom of the Figure 6, respectively. The example results exhibited
similar profiles and also show a significant sensitivity for BRAF
mutations.

6 Summary

MACE is a useful tool that integrates drug response and gene ex—
pression data for the purpose of mutation— or lineage—based analysis.
MACE provides fold changes for chemical responses and gene
expression together with enrichment scores as statistical methods to

find unknown sensitivity or selectivity of chemical response (or gene
expression) on given mutation or lineage categories.

MACE provides a powerful 3D shape—based algorithm for chem-
ical searches as well as for typical 2D searches. 3D shape compari—
son is a promising new approach for studying structure—activity
relationships in general drug discovery, overcoming the limitations
of chemical diversity in conventional 2D searches (He, et al.,
2013a). In a previous study, the 3D shape—based metric could pro—
vide better resolution than the 2D structure—based method for iden—
tifying compound pairs with similar cellular response profiles (He,
et al., 2013b). Adapting both 2D and 3D search methods, MACE
provides a flexible chemical search for the identification of various
chemical entities with similar profiles of cellular response in cancers.

Furthermore, MACE attempts to integrate chemical response
and gene expression data based on profile similarities over NCI60
cell lines. MACE enables identification of many unexpected rela—
tionships of gene—gene, chemical—chemical or gene—chemical pairs
that potentially exhibit common underlying mechanisms for chem-
ical response and/or gene expression. MACE also provides browsing
options for identification of highly sensitive or resistant chemicals
or signature genes to a given category, and as such, allows users
to exploit groups of chemicals with similar mutation- or lineage-
specific responses and genes with similar specific differences of
expression.

We believe that MACE will serve as an advanced tool in cancer
research, not only for the discovery of novel anticancer candidates
but also for understanding specific mechanisms of drug action and
gene expression.

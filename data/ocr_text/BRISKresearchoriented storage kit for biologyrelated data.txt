ABSTRACT

Motivation: In genetic science, large-scale international research
collaborations represent a growing trend. These collaborations
have demanding and challenging database, storage, retrieval and
communication needs. These studies typically involve demographic
and clinical data, in addition to the results from numerous genomic
studies (omics studies) such as gene expression, eQTL, genome-
wide association and methylation studies, which present numerous
challenges, thus the need for data integration platforms that can
handle these complex data structures. Inefficient methods of data
transfer and access control still plague research collaboration. As
science becomes more and more collaborative in nature, the need
for a system that adequately manages data sharing becomes
paramount.

Results: Biology-Related Information Storage Kit (BRISK) is a
package of several web-based data management tools that provide
a cohesive data integration and management platform. It was
specifically designed to provide the architecture necessary to
promote collaboration and expedite data sharing between scientists.
Availability and Implementation: The software, documentation,
Java source code and demo are available at http://genapha.icapture
.ubc.ca/brisk/index.jsp. BRISK was developed in Java, and tested
on an Apache Tomcat 6 server with a MySQL database.

1 INTRODUCTION

In biomedical studies, statistical power is important because some
associations can be undetected if statistical power is low. A simple
way to improve power is to increase the sample size; this drives
scientists to collaborate and share their data. Several consortia
have been created to facilitate collaborative scientiﬁc efforts
on national and international scales. Large—scale collaborations
generate substantial amounts of data that is useful for analysis
but can be difﬁcult to manage. Delegating access and managing
information for such large sets of data can be problematic if not
appropriately handled. Labs can adequately manage large amounts
of data by using laboratory information management systems.
However, delegating access to data can be a problem as some
groups may want to limit access to unpublished data (Schadt et al.,
2010). Studies of scientiﬁc publications, from the past 20 years,
have shown a continuous increase in collaboration between scientists

(Sonnenwald, 2007). New tools need to be developed to account for
the increasingly collaborative nature of science.

We were driven to develop Biology—related Information Storage
Kit (BRISK) to facilitate collaboration and simplify data sharing
for investigators in the AllerGen (The Allergy, Genes and
Environment Network) consortium (http://www.allergen—nce.ca/
and http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/index.do). BRISK is an open—
sourced software package that provides the infrastructure necessary
for efﬁcient communication between collaborators regarding data
and sample storage, data formats and data retrieval. It has the
ability to handle and organize large datasets, including data
generated in longitudinal studies. BRISK has been used by
investigators to retrieve information from hi gh—throughput Genome—
Wide Association Studies (GWAS) with hundreds of thousands of
markers (>500 000), to smaller scale Illumina Golden Gate arrays
with 1536 markers.

2 FUNCTIONALITY

BRISK is a package of three Java EE web applications that can
be used independently, or as a package to provide a unifying
system for managing samples and data. Communication between
tools in BRISK is made possible by the underlying database. The
BRISK software package has three main services; a Sample—based
laboratory information Management System, Investigator Services
and Web Information Services. Figure 1 provides an overview of
BRISK’s structure and the functionality of the three services. BRISK
was developed for deployment on a server running Apache Tomcat
6.0 and a MySQL database, with a Linux OS; however, these are not
strict requirements. The underlying code of the application is written
in Java 1.6, and uses Hibernate 3.3.1 to facilitate the mapping of
Java classes to database tables. The web interfaces are generated by
J avaServer Pages backed by the Struts Application Framework.

BRISK was designed for clinical investigators and both wet
(genotyping biology, microbiology) and dry laboratory (statistical
and administrative) users. BRISK is intended to be installed
by a database manager/developer and comes with deployment
instructions, and both user and technical manuals for developers
and permissions documentation which can be downloaded from
the BRISK site (http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/brisk/documentation
.do). In addition we have created an interactive demonstration (demo
site) preloaded with practice data that will allow users to explore the
utility of the BRISK package.

system (Van Rossum et al., 2010) It is intended to be used
internally by lab staff to manage sample, subject and container
data. Since the last release version of SLIMS, four new key
features—barcode support, remote sample entry, attachment of
ﬁles, Illumina importer—have been implemented into SLIMS to
make it an invaluable tool for sample management. The addition
of barcode functionality, for samples, provides lab staff greater
control over the management of physical samples. A new interface
made speciﬁcally for remote—entry was developed. Samples can
be tagged with barcodes and added into the database at the site of
sample collection; this is crucial for the management of samples
in multicenter studies. Users can attach datasheets and digitized
documents onto each sample, providing a centralized location for
investigators to obtain sample information. The attached ﬁles are
stored as Binary Large Objects on the database, so there is no
discrimination of ﬁle types when uploading. Database updates and
insertions are made simpler through a new data importer. When
genotyping data returns from a genotyping run at a centre that uses
the Illumina platform, we can use the exported data ﬁle generated
by Illumina BeadStudio to automatically populate the database with
little effort from the user.

2.2 Investigator services

Intended to be used primarily by principal investigators, statisticians
and data analysts, Investigator Services acts as a centralized location
for retrieving data. It allows each user to be self sufﬁcient, without
the need to rely on another staff member to generate analysis ﬁles for
them. After the database has been populated with data from a genome
wide association study (GWAS), Investigator Services provides
users with the ability to generate a variety of data formats, which
can then be used as input ﬁles for the various software packages
used in the statistical analysis. This has been accomplished with the
use of a graphical user interface (GUI) that questions the user about
the data format and content. Once the user has selected the dataset,
to be analyzed they are asked if they want to ﬁlter data by removing
duplicate subjects, twins and other relevant information. For family
datasets, the user is queried on the data formats (trio’s or case—
control). The next screen asks the user what genes to include, the
phenotype to be analyzed, covariates to be added and for continuous
variables do they want to convert the data to a binary phenotype. The
ﬁnal step asks the user for the data format, current options include
UNPHASED, binary PLINK, FBAT and SAGE ﬁle formats.

This allows each data analyst to work off a standardized set
of data to prevent the use of outdated or modiﬁed data. An

automated permissions request system is implemented to facilitate
data requests and maintain integrity of consortium studies. Each
user can be limited to the amount of data they have access to. If
a user wants access to data they are not currently authorized to
access, primary investigators can be notiﬁed to provide the user
with the necessary permissions. The status of data requests can be
monitored using a web—based user interface. Additionally, all data
requests are date and time stamped to provide an electronic record
of data requests and data releases. In our personal implementation
of BRISK, Investigator Services is only available via an internal
network link, this is to protect and maintain the security of
conﬁdential and sensitive information contained in the genotype and
phenotype databases which could be used to identify individuals.
Research Oriented tools (analysis ﬁles, raw genotyping QC results
and protocols, questionnaire, environmental exposure information)
refers to utilities that can interface directly with raw genotypes, or
link genotypes, phenotypes, exposures or questionnaire responses
together. Direct access to these databases is restricted to individuals
that are on—site and within the secure network. Information requests
from outside investigators are accepted by a public server, the
request is then automatically forwarded to the internal network by
the either database administrator or the local Principal Investigator
in charge of the study.

2.3 Web Information Services

Web Information Services is the public arm of our services and
was developed as an automatic data retrieval system for the massive
amounts of data generated in GWAS. It has two main functionalities:
it provides the lab with a place to describe their research and present
their ﬁndings, and it allows the public to explore and interact with
the data. The default Web Information Services template can be
modiﬁed with ease to ﬁt the theme of the lab, and the information
that needs to be presented. By default, when data are imported
into the database through SLIMS, data are put into the ‘Private’
dataset therefore only accessible by users with login credentials.
However, data can be made accessible to the public by adding
the data to the ‘Public’ dataset. Communication Tools includes a
suite of utilities that allows users to graphically view, plot and
interact with association results. Manhattan plots can be plotted to
the user speciﬁcations, a GUI guides the user through the selection
of variables to be plotted, see Figure 2 for an example plot of
association results.

Basic analysis tools are available for users that are interested
in taking a further look at the data; these tools include many
of the features ﬁrst developed for PATH (Zamar et al., 2009)
including a suite of mapping tools that connect to external databanks
such as the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI), and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
(Kanehisa, 2002; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000; Kanehisa et al.,
2006, 2008) and the Genetic Association Database (Becker
et al., 2004; http://geneticassociationdb.nih.gov). Custom mapping
tools allow the user to build their own pathways and view
pathways and test for gene—gene interactions. Web Information
Services has been set—up using the Genapha website as a model
(http://genapha.icapture.ubc.ca/index.do). Genapha was initially
designed to host the research results and ﬁndings from a
collaborative international genetics initiative to identify genes
related to asthma and allergy phenotypes (Daley et al., 2009).
During the development Genapha, we continued to add new tools
and features, and over time Genapha expanded from a static results
repository into an interactive site and we have incorporated many
of these features into BRISK.

3 DISCUSSION

BRISK was built taking into account the growing collaborative
nature of science. Data management in collaborative research
involves working with restrictions and protocols that are not
routinely found in research carried out in a single laboratory.
Researchers must consider how the data will be stored and
distributed so anyone that needs to access the data can do so without
difﬁculty. On the other hand, they must also restrict access to
sensitive and undisclosed data. Data integrity is ensured through
a multi—tier login system; each user account can only access data in
their account tier. By providing efﬁcient data storage and features
that cater to the needs of researchers, BRISK sets itself apart from
other database management tools. There is a similar open—sourced
data management package called SIMBioMS (Krestyaninova et al.,
2009). The feature set offered by SIMBioMS is oriented toward
storage and retrieval—related functions used in collaborative studies;
many of these features are also present in BRISK. However, in
addition to these basic features, BRISK contains tools that help
researchers organize, mine and analyze study data. Furthermore,
there are tools in BRISK that allow researchers to test and explore
additional data for further analysis. These features enable BRISK to
act as a centralized hub where users can go to access information.

BRISK is an advance from BioWarehouse (Lee et al., 2006)
in that BRISK uniﬁes information from clinical (phenotypes),
laboratory (SLIMS biological samples) and GWAS association
results with electronic online database resources. BioWarehouse
compiles information from a variety of electronic resources such
as ENZYME, KEGG and BioCyc and integrates the information
from these sources using a mulitdatabase approach. BioWarehouse
does not incorporate analysis tools, clinical or genotype information.
BioWharehouse retrieves and stores information locally. The
advantages of this approach are that users can select which version
of a database they wish to interrogate and they are not limited in the
types of databases that can be queried. The disadvantage is that the
data is stored locally and may not be up to date.

Similar to BioMediator and the BioConductor platforms that have
been developed for the analysis of gene expression arrays (Mei

et al., 2003) BRISK uses a semantic architecture such that the
data stays at the source (NCBI resources). This architecture has
several advantages; the data is stored, managed and maintained
at the source rather than locally. This avoids data warehousing,
which helps to manage and maximize local resources by cutting
down on the storage space necessary for BRISK. It also ensures
that at query time, when the data is accessed, the data is up
to date and accurate. We are able to do this because the NCBI
resources can be queried via the internet, although the number
of queries per user per minute is limited. Genetics is a rapidly
evolving and changing discipline and information is being changed,
compiled and updated daily, given these conditions dynamic access
is preferred over data warehousing. Also similar to BioMediator
and BioConductor, BRISK is an open source project, we anticipate
that ongoing development will be collaborative. BRISK has been
proven in heavy use and has been developed and maintained
by a professional development team. To facilitate the ongoing
development of BRISK we have published the project on Google
Code see (http://code.google.com/hosting/). Each service has its
own project site Investigator Services (http://code.google.com/p
/brisk—investigator—services/), Web Information Services (http://
code.google.com/p/brisk—web—information—servicesl) and BRISK
Sample—based Laboratory Information Management System (http://
code. google.com/p/brisk—slimsl). This will allow BRISK to further
evolve to meet the needs of its users and developers world—wide.

Limitations: BRISK currently manages and maintains genotype,
clinical and laboratory information. It works well with GWAS level
data but we acknowledge that BRISK does not address all the
needs of ‘omics’ studies. We have not addressed gene—expression,
methylation or sequence level data concerns in this release as these
utilities are currently in development. Data integration platforms are
an emerging endeavor and there is no ‘one size ﬁts all’ approach at
this time. This is likely because the development of these platforms
has been driven by the research needs of the groups they serve.
BRISK and Genapha (www.genapha.ca) were developed to meet
the needs of an emerging genetics consortium whose needs were the
management of laboratory samples, clinical phenotypes, exposure
and questionnaire data and genotypes from candidate gene and
GWAS. BRISK has numerous utilities to address these needs.

However, sequence level data will soon be the ‘norm’ for genetic
consortium studies, and new data models will need to be developed
that can handle the complexity and size of genome—wide sequence
data. Data import and exporting of genome—wide sequence data
within a MySQL database framework is unlikely to be feasible, as it
will be prohibitively time consuming. Data management needs are
growing rapidly and the need for new tools that can organize and
integrate data from diverse data structures and sources are urgently
needed.

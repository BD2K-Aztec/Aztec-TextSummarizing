Abstract

Motivation: Loops in proteins are often involved in biochemical functions. Their irregularity and
flexibility make experimental structure determination and computational modeling challenging.
Most current loop modeling methods focus on modeling single loops. In protein structure predic—
tion, multiple loops often need to be modeled simultaneously. As interactions among loops in spa—
tial proximity can be rather complex, sampling the conformations of multiple interacting loops is a
challenging task.

Results: In this study, we report a new method called multi—Ioop Qstance—guided Sequential chain—
ﬁwth Monte Carlo (M-DISGRO) for prediction of the conformations of multiple interacting loops in
proteins. Our method achieves an average RMSD of 1.93A for lowest energy conformations of 36
pairs of interacting protein loops with the total length ranging from 12 to 24 residues. We further
constructed a data set containing proteins with 2, 3 and 4 interacting loops. For the most challeng—
ing target proteins with four loops, the average RMSD of the lowest energy conformations is
2.35 A. Our method is also tested for predicting multiple loops in ﬁ—barrel membrane proteins. For
outer—membrane protein G, the lowest energy conformation has a RMSD of 2.62A for the three
extracellular interacting loops with a total length of 34 residues (12, 12 and 10 residues in each
loop).

Michalsky et 61]., 2003; Subramani and Floudas, 2012; van Vlijmen
and Karplus, 1997; Zhang et 61]., 2007a; Zhao et 61]., 2011; Zhu
et 61]., 2006;). Among these, database search methods can make ac—
curate loop prediction if templates of loop fragments to a query pro—
tein are found at a high level of confidence (Choi and Deane, 2010;
Michalsky et 61]., 2003). With the rapid expansion of the PDB, frag-
ment—based approaches are very effective for modeling loop struc—
tures (Fernandez—Fuentes et 61]., 2006a; Fernandez—Fuentes and Fiser,
2006b; Fernandez—Fuentes et 61]., 2010). Nevertheless, fragment
based loop modeling approaches are blind to the local environment
of loops, and currently are not applicable for modeling multiple
loops that are interacting with each other. In such cases, it is neces—
sary to use template—free methods to predict loop structures. Recent
advances have enabled template—free prediction of loops with high
accuracy (Canutescu and Dunbrack, 2003; Coutsias et 61]., 2004;
Fiser et 61]., 2000; Jacobson et 61]., 2004; Tang et 61]., 2014; Zhao
et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2006).

Most previous loop modeling studies have focused on predicting
structure of a single loop. In reality, multiple loops often need to be
modeled for a particular protein target, where loops in spatial prox—
imity can interact in complex ways (Housset et 61]., 1991; Zaccardi
et 61]., 2014). An example of interacting loops can be found in the
bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor (BPTI, pdb 6pti), where loop A
(residues 7—16) interacts with loop B (35—46). A single substitution
in loop B (Y35G, pdb 8pti) results in substantial changes to the
conformations of both loop A and loop B (Housset et 61]., 1991). In
this case, the conformations of the two loops are stabilized by their
interactions.

Interacting loops are also found in membrane proteins. For ex-
ample, in the B-barrel assembly machinery A protein, the extracellu—
lar loops interact with one another, and form a dome over the top of
the B—barrel domain (Noinaj et 61]., 2013). Given that the transmem—
brane strands of many B—barrel membrane proteins can be predicted
(Naveed et 61]., 2012), accurate loop structure prediction will facili-
tate the prediction of full structures of this important class of mem-
brane proteins.

Conventional methods for modeling interacting loops are to gen—
erate single loops sequentially one loop after another. However,
these methods are prone to be trapped at local energy minima
formed by intra—loop interactions, since it cannot effectively model
the complex interactions among the loops in spatial proximity. To
resolve this issue, several methods have been developed that can
model two interacting loops (Danielson and Lill, 2010; Rosenbach
and Rosenfeld, 1995). In Rosenbach and Rosenfeld (1995), a
method for simultaneous prediction of the structure of multiple
loops based on the bond—scaling—relaxation loop—closure algorithm
was reported. For two loops of lengths of five to seven residues in
spatial proximity, their results showed that more accurate predic—
tions can be made than modeling individual loop sequentially.
Danielson and Lill (2010) developed the Coers method, in which
an energetically feasible ensemble of individual loops are generated
using the loopyMod method (Soto et 61]., 2008) disregarding the
presence of other loops. Although successful in predicting a number
of interacting loop pairs, this method does not work well when both
loops have 29 residues. Methods have also been developed to model
loops in certain protein classes (e.g. antibodies, Sellers et 61]., 2010),
using information specific to these classes of proteins. To the best of
our knowledge, none of these existing methods can effectively pre—
dict three or more interacting loops.

In this study, we describe the multi—loop Distance—guided chain—
Growth Monte Carlo method (M—DISGRO) for simultaneously mod—
eling of two or more interacting loops. Based on chain—growth

Monte Carlo sampling, which has been applied to a number of stud—
ies of proteins (Liang et 61]., 2002; Lin et 61]., 2011; Tang et 61]., 2014;
Zhang and Liu, 2006; Zhang et 61]., 2007b), M—DISGRO simultan—
eously constructs multiple loops, and does not require completeness
of one loop before growing another loop. This sampling strategy
randomizes the order of the residues being sampled to generate
more diverse loop conformations, making it less likely to over—sam—
ple conformations in certain local energy minima. Consequently, in-
ter—loop interactions are taken into account more effectively
compared with sampling one loop at a time. In addition, loop
growth is guided by empirical end—to—end distance functions and
backbone dihedral angle distributions, allowing effective explor-
ation of low—energy conformational space (Liu, 2008; Liu and Chen,
1998; Tang et 61]., 2014; Wong, 2013; Zhang et 61]., 2007a). To im—
prove the sampling of long loops, we further introduce a strategy of
regrowing loops using fragments.

This article is organized as follows. We first describe the M-
DISGRO method in detail. We then present results for loop predic—
tion of soluble proteins using two different test data sets, followed
by results on predicting multiple interacting loops in B-barrel mem-
brane proteins. We show that M—DISGRO has significant advantages
in modeling native-like multi—loop compared with Coers reported
in Danielson and Lill (2010). The performance is further improved
when loop fragments are used.

2 Methods

2.1 Multi—Ioops distance—guided chain—growth Monte
Carlo (m—DiSGro)

Based on our previous DiSGro method for sampling single loops,
our task in this study is to model 11 Z 2 loops in spatial proximity in
protein structures (Tang et 61]., 2014). M—DISGRO simultaneously
samples conformations of the n loops. At each step of the chain
growth process, a residue 1' in a chosen loop p is added upon comple—
tion of the previous residues in all of the n loops. Here loop p is
chosen randomly from the n loops, regardless of loop lengths. The
newly added residue is represented by three consecutive backbone
atoms during the growth process: C atom of residue 1', N atom of

dcth, which is based on known distance dCAhct and the conditional distribu-
tion of 7t(dci,ct|dCAhct). Once dchct is sampled, C,- can be placed on two pos-
itions with equal probabilities. Here in is the selected position of C,-. C( is
placed at the position xC/J alternative to XCJ. Similarly, the N,-+1 atom has to
be on the circle QN and its position xNJ-H is determined by dNi+hCt in a similar
fashion

residue 1' —I— 1, and CA atom of residue i—I— 1 (Fig. 1). The coordinates
of the three atoms, Ci, Ni+1 and CA)“, are denoted as chi, XNJ+1
and XCA71+1, respectively. Here chi and XNJH are determined by
sampling the dihedral angles ((1),  We describe this sampling pro—
cess in detail in Section ‘Sampling backbone atoms’. The 0) dihedral
angles that determine the coordinate of CA atoms are sampled from
a normal distribution with a mean of 1800 and SD of 4°. Side—chains
are built upon completion of backbone placement of all loops. The
generated conformations of the loops are scored and ranked by our
atom—based distance—dependent empirical potential function. Our
potential function is an empirical function following (Li et al., 2003;
Miyazawa and Jernigan, 1996; Pokarowski et al., 2005; Zhang et
al., 2005; Zhou and Zhou, 2002). Explicit water molecules are not
considered, and there is no specific solvation energy calculation be—
yond what is implicit in the empirical potential function. Details of
side—chain construction and the atomic potential function are
described in Tang et al. (2014).

Unlike the Coers method, which is based on ensembles of
individual loops with complete structures (Danielson and Lill,
2010), M—DISGRO does not require completeness of one loop before
growing another loop. It generates multiple loops by randomly se—
lecting one residue to grow from all incomplete loops. All previously
built residues in different loops immediately become part of the
structural environment and contribute to the calculation of the co—
ordinates of future atoms. When compared with methods based on
sampling one whole loop at a time, our method can generate more
diverse conformations of multiple loops, and can effectively avoid
being trapped at some local energy minima.

2.2 Loop fragment libraries

During the chain growth process, a partial conformation may have
to adopt a state with very high (or infinite) energy, making further
growth fruitless. For example, it may be impossible to add any
atoms due to lack of available space and loops may fail to close. M-
DISGRO would have to terminate the whole chain—growth process
upon such a failure. This is costly if failure occurs when a significant
or the full portion of other loops have been built.

To increase the efficiency of sampling, we develop a fragment—
based regrowth method to repair failed loops in M—DISGRO, as the
near—native regions can be more efficiently explored by using frag—
ments to generate an adequate number of native—like loop conform-
ations. The overall procedure of M—DISGRO with fragments is
outlined in Figure 2.

For a protein with n loops to be sampled, we first build 11 loop
fragment libraries, one for each loop. Conformations in each library
are sampled independently in the absence of the other 11 — 1 loops.
All loop fragments are generated using the DiSGro single loop pre—
diction method (Tang et al., 2014). Conformations of the individual
loops generated are then ranked by the atom—based distance—
dependent empirical potential function described in Tang et al.
(2014). For each individual loop, the top—50 energetically favorable
loop conformations are retained to form the loop fragment library
specific to this loop.

During the chain-growth process, when a failure occurs in loop p
which begins at residue 5 and ends at residue t with a length of
(t — s —I— 1), a randomly selected fragment f of length (t — s — 3) from
its loop fragment library, is used to replace the residues from s to
(t — 4) of loop [9. As we apply the Coutsias—Seok—Jacobson—Dill
(CSJD) analytical closure method (Coutsias et al., 2004) at the resi—
due (t — 2) to close the loop, the replacement of residues 5 to (t — 2)
will lead to a high occurrence of highly similar loop conformations.

In order to introduce the necessary diversity in loop conformations
while at the same time achieving high sampling efficiency, we only
replace the residues 5 to (t — 4) with residues from fragment  The
multi—loop chain—growth process is then continued until the rest of
the residues of all loops, including residues (t — 3) to t of loop p, are
fully built. This fragment strategy is only used for loops of length
25. For short loops of length 34, the success rate of completing
loops without fragments is already sufficient.

2.3 Sampling backbone atoms

The procedure to sample backbone atoms is the same as that of the
single loop method DiSGro (Tang et al., 2014). Below we give a
brief description for completeness. Let C, be the C—terminal anchor
atom in the end residue t of a loop. We describe the sampling pro—
cedure for (Ci, 0,, Ni+1 and CA“) atoms as an example (Fig. 1).

C,- is generated first, followed by Ni+1. Denote the distance |Xc7t
—XCA71| between XCAJ and cht as dCAijct, and the distance |chi — cht
| between chi and cht as dchct. As the bond length chhci, and the
bond angle 0C7, are fixed, C,- will be located on a circle QC (Fig. 1):

QC : {X E R3| suchthat  — XCA71|| : chhci, (1)

and (X — XCAji) - (XCAJ — XNai) : cos 0(3)}

Given a fixed dcijct, C,- can be placed on two positions chi and Xclai
on circle QC, chi and Xclai are labeled as C,- and C(, respectively. As
the probability for placing C,- on either position is equal, we ran—
domly select one position to place atom Ci.

Sampling from the empirical distributions of dchct and mapping
back to C,- should encourage the growth of loops to connect to the
terminal Ct atom. Further analysis of the empirical distribution of
dchct given dCAhCt shows that dCAhCt can be very informative for
sampling dcijct in some cases. This leads us to design a strategy of

Fig. 2. The flowchart of M-DISGRO using fragments. In this example, three
interacting loops (L1—L3) are to be modeled. Loop fragment libraries for them
are constructed separately using the single loop method DiSGro (Tang et al.,
2014). At each step of the chain growth process, a residue is added to a ran-
domly chosen loop of L1-L3. This is repeated until all loops are completed.
Here newly added residues are shown in red online and grey in print. In this
example, a residue (red/grey circle) is added to L2 in step 1. Another residue
(red/grey circle) is added to L3 in step 2. When a failure occurs (L3 in this ex-
ample), a loop fragment is drawn from the corresponding library to replace
the failed conformation. This process of adding residues is continued until
the three missing loops are fully constructed

3 Results
3.1 Test sets

To assess the accuracy of M—DISGRO and facilitate direct comparison
with the Coers method reported in Danielson and Lill (2010), we
use their test set, which we name as the Coers Set. It is obtained
from high-resolution (1.53 A) structure of trypsin (pdb 1utk) (Leiros
et al., 2004). It contains 36 pairs of interacting loops, including 7
pairs of 6—6—residue loops, 10 pairs of 6—9—residue loops, 3 pairs of
9—9—residue loops, 9 pairs of 6—12—residue loops, 5 pairs of 9—
12-residue loops and 2 pairs of 12—12—residue loops.

We have also developed a new data set of 2—, 3— and 4—interacting
loops, called MultiSet, to assess the effectiveness of M—DISGRO in
more complex situations. Proteins in this set are taken from (Fiser et
al. (2000) and Soto et al. (2008). In total, MultiSet contains twenty
2—interacting loops, eleven 3—interacting loops and eight 4—interact—
ing loops (see Table 2). We use a strict criterion to select interacting
loops: all loops must be spatially close and interact with each other.
For example, each of the four loops has to be interacting with the
other three loops in a four—loop target. We use the edge simplices
from the alpha—shape computed from the protein structures to detect
interactions among neighboring loops (Edelsbrunner and Mucke,
1994; Li et al., 2003; Liang et al., 1998). Using alpha—shape elimin-
ates spurious neighbor interactions that are not in physical contact
(Ouyang and Liang, 2008; Zhang et al., 2005). Here we use the
solvent radius of 0.5  following (Singh and Thornton, 1993). In
MultiSet, loops have lengths ranging from 4 to 16. To construct a
challenging data set of two interacting loops, both loops have to be
at least 10—residue long. For three— and four—loop target proteins,
only those with at least one long loop (lengch 10) are included.
Multiple interacting loops are present across different protein fami-
lies. Based on the classification scheme of loops of the Archdb
(Bonet et al., 2013), 42.9% of long loops (210) and 48.6% of loops
in the MultiSet have already been classified, suggesting modeling
multiple loops will be applicable to a large number of proteins.

our atom—based distance—dependent empirical potential function
(Tang et al., 2014) instead of the DFIRE empirical potential func-
tion as in Danielson and Lill (2010). For each loop pair, the RMSD
of the lowest energy conformation to the native structure REM-n
among 10 000 trial conformations is reported. Our results are all re—
ported as global backbone RMSD, calculated using the N, CA, C
and O atoms of the backbone. The conformation of a loop is ob—
tained by superimposing its two ends on the ﬂanking secondary
structures, while the deviation is calculated using the backbone
atoms of the loop structure.

From the results summarized in Table 1, we find that M—DISGRO
performs significantly better than Coers. Compared with Coers,
M—DISGRO has a REM-n of 1.14 versus 2.35  for 6—6—residue loop pairs,
2.00 versus 3.39A for 6—9—residue loop pairs, 2.14 versus 4.38  for
9—9—residue loop pairs, 2.67 versus 4.43  for 6—12—residue loop pairs,
2.94 versus 5 .47A for 9—12—residue loop pairs and 3.32 versus 6.97A
for 12—12-residue loop pairs, respectively. Overall, the value of REM-n
is reduced significantly using M—DISGRO compared with Coers.

When fragments are used, M—DISGRO further improves REM-n to
1.5 7 from 2.00A for 6—9—residue loop pairs, 1.64 from 2.14A for
9—9—residue loop pairs, 2.5 3 from 2.67A for 6—12—residue loop
pairs, 2.41 from 2.94A for 9—12-residue loop pairs and 2.87 from
3.32A for 12—12—residue loop pairs, respectively. Only for 6—6—
residue loop pairs, M—DISGRO with fragment has a slightly larger
REM-n of 1.19 These results indicate that using loop fragment li—
brary is effective in improving the modeling accuracy when loops
are nine residues or longer.

We also report results using a single independent loop modeling
method s—DiSGro for comparison. A maximum number of 10 000
loop combinations are generated by initially combining the top—100
ranked single loop conformations of each loop region, similar to
Coers, except single loop conformations are generated here by the
DiSGro method (Tang et al., 2014) instead of the loopyMod (Soto
et al., 2008) used in Coers. s—DiSGro performs much worse in
modeling multiple interacting loops compared with M—DISGRO, with
or without fragments (3.15 versus 1.93/2.22 A), but shows improved
accuracy compared with Coers method (3.15 versus 4.02 A).

The average REM-n of 36 interacting loop pairs are 1.93 
(M-DISGRO with fragment), 2.22A (M—DISGRo without fragment),
3.152% (s-DiSGro) and 4.022% (Coers). Overall, M-DISGRO with
fragment shows significantly improved accuracy in modeling mul-
tiple interacting loops.

M-DISGRO is also much faster than Coers. The reported compu—
tational time of Coers is about 900 cpu minutes for two 12—residue
interacting loops on a single core of a Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz quad—
core machine (Danielson and Lill, 2010). The computation cost for
M—DISGRO without fragment is only 14 cpu minutes on a single

Fig. 3. Examples of prediction results of interacting loops of soluble proteins
and [i-barrel membrane proteins using M-DISGRO with fragment. The lowest
energy modeled loops by M-DISGRO with fragment is in red/dark. The native
loops are in white/light. (a) Four interacting loops of azurin (pdb 1nwp, resi-
dues 36—48, 65—79, 84—90 and 112—121). The total length of the four loops is
45. The REmin is 2.77 A. (b) Three extracellular loops of OmpG protein (pdb
2 x 9 k, residues 97—106, 138—149 and 177—188). The total length of the three
loops is 34. The REmin of this three-loop target is 2.62 A. There exists a short or-
helical secondary structure element of four residues which is correctly
predicted

2 GHz AMD Opteron processor. M—DISGRO with fragment takes a
slightly longer time of 17min, as loop fragment libraries specific to
the loops need to be constructed on the ﬂy.

3.3 Multi—Ioop structure prediction on MultiSet
We then test M—DISGRO on the MultiSet. Results are summarized in
Table 2.

For the eight proteins with four—interacting loops, the average
REM-n by M—DISGRO with and without fragment are 2.35 and 2.75 A,
respectively. M—DISGRO with fragment is close to the accuracy level
of sub—angstrom (1.04 A) for three target proteins containing only
one loop with more than 10 residues. The remaining five target pro—
teins are challenging, as they have at least two long loops with
length 210. For these five target proteins, M—DISGRO with fragment
has an REM-n of 3.13  Of these five, three of them have three long
loops. For example, the structure of mandelate racemase (pdb 2mnr)
has four loops of length 13, 13, 14 and 9, respectively. The REM-n by
M—DISGRO with fragment is 2.96  Another example is azurin (pdb
1nwp), which has four loops of length 7, 10, 13 and 15, respectively.
It is challenging to model a 15—residue loop in an inexact environ—
ment when three other interacting loops also need to be modeled as
well. The total length of these loops is 45 residues. As can be seen
from Figure 3a, M-DISGRO with fragment achieves good accuracy
for 1nwp, with an REM-n of 2.77 

For the eleven 3—loop target proteins, REM-n by M—DISGRO with
and without fragment are 2.13 and 2.32 A, respectively. For the
seven 3—loop target proteins with only one loop longer than 10 resi-
dues, M—DISGRO with fragment has an average REM-n of 1.86  The
REM-n of the rest of the three—loop target proteins with at least two
long loops are 2.52  by M—DISGRO with fragment.

For the twenty 2—loop target proteins, REM-n values are 2.61 and
3.26A with and without using fragments, respectively. This two—
loop data set is challenging, as both loops have lengths ZlO—residue.
Among the three— and four—loop target proteins, short loops can be
modeled fairly easily with high accuracy, which contribute to the
overall improved RMSD. In thirteen of the twenty 2—loops target
proteins, M-DISGRO with fragment achieves good accuracy of
REM," g 3 A, with six of them of RMSD g 2  Even when there is a
loop of length 2 15 , M-DISGRO with fragment also gives good REM-n.
An example is lactoferrin (pdb 11cf), which has a 16— and a 13—resi—
due loops. The RMSD of the lowest energy conformation is 2.63

Overall, M—DISGRO with fragment achieves good accuracy in mod—
eling multi—loops in the MultiSet. It also achieves an improved accuracy
compared with M—DISGRO without fragment, with an average R Em,” of
2.35 versus 2.75  for eight 4—loop, 2.13 versus 2.32A for eleven 3—
loop and 2.61 versus 3.26  for twenty 2—loop target proteins.

3.4 Multi—Ioop structure prediction of B—Barrel
membrane proteins
We also assess M—DISGRO in predicting loop conformations of B-bar-
rel membrane proteins. Results are summarized in Table 3. For
extracellular loops, the average RMSD of the lowest energy loop
conformations REM-n of the four proteins by M-DISGRO with frag-
ment is 1.88 Among these, 2 of the 4 extracellular loops in the
Neisserial surface protein A, NspA (pdb 1p4t) are longer than 10
residues (Vandeputte—Rutten et al., 2003). The predicted extracellu—
lar loop structures have an REM-n of 1.54  The outer membrane
protein G, OmpG (pdb 2 X 9 k) has three long extracellular loops of
length 10, 12 and 12, respectively. The REM-n of this three—loop tar—
get protein is 2.62  Noticeably, there is a short helix in the middle
of the 12-residue (138—149) loop. M—DISGRO with fragment success—
fully predicts this short helical secondary structural element without
any explicit additional secondary structure information (Fig. 3b).
The periplasmic loops are usually short turns connecting
B—strands. Most of them have lengths <10—residue. Prediction of
these periplasmic loops is not as challenging as prediction of extra—
cellular loops. The average RMSD REM-n of the lowest energy peri—
plasmic loop conformations of the four proteins by M—DISGRO with
fragment is 1.35  For the four interacting loops at the periplasmic
end of OmpG, REM-n is only 0.93 

4 Conclusion and Discussion

In this study, we present a multi—loop chain—growth Monte Carlo
method (M-DISGRO) for modeling interacting loops. Our method
samples multiple loops by growing one residue at a randomly se—
lected loop in each step. The calculation of the positions of newly
added atoms is determined by the coordinates of previous placed
atoms in all loops. This method is capable of exploring large con-
formational space of multi—loop effectively, without frequently being
trapped in narrow or dead space. With further incorporation of loop
fragment libraries, even failed loops can be efficiently regrown. M-
DISGRO has significant advantages in predicting multiple interacting
loops over previous methods, such as the Coers method
(Danielson and Lill, 2010), as interacting information among loops
are taken into account during the simultaneous chain—growth
process.

M-DISGRO can model multiple interacting loops simultaneously
and efficiently, especially for those target proteins with long loops.
For a set of 36 interacting loop pairs, M—DISGRO with and without
fragment have better average REM-n of 1.93 and 2.22 A, compared
with Coers of 4.02  For 12—12—residue loop pairs, the REM-n by
M—DISGRO with fragment is 2.87 A, and the average computing time
is only 17min. Furthermore, our method is the first that considers
three— and four—interacting loops explicitly. It successfully predicts
these loop structures, with an REM-n of 2.13  for three—loop target
proteins, and 2.35  for four—loop target proteins. Preliminary re-
sults on building loops in B—barrel membrane proteins suggest that
our method can be extended to model multiple loops of other com—
plex membrane proteins.

Our study shows that by randomizing the order of residues to be
sampled, we can generate more diverse sets of loop conformations,

which helps to increase the overall sampling effectiveness. However,
it is possible that there exist specific orders by which loop residues
are to be sampled that are especially effective for certain proteins.
For example, residues in more constrained environment may need to
be sampled first. One approach towards this is to look—ahead and
further sample a number of states that can be grown into in the next
step for each loop, and then select one state to place the next residue
according to either energy or other specific bias criterion. Those
sampled but unused states can be reused in future steps. This ap—
proach has been successfully applied to side chain conformations of
proteins (Zhang and Liu, 2006) and reaction network sampling
(Cao and Liang, 2013).

There are several directions for further improvement. The single
loop method DiSGro is an important component of M—DISGRO.
DiSGro is also the limiting step for the accuracy of modeled multiple
interacting loops, especially when there are long loops. We envision
that this can be improved by sampling dipeptide segment instead of
sampling individual residue currently implemented in DiSGro. It
will likely lead to improved sampling efficiency further and enable
longer loops to be modeled (Zhao et al., 2011). Our work is also
related to modeling loops in a flexible environment (Sellers et al.,
2008; Subramani and Floudas, 2012), as other loops can be re—
garded as the ﬂexible environment of the loop currently being mod—
eled. Furthermore, the atom—based distance—dependent empirical
potential function taken from Ref (Tang et al., 2014), can be im—
proved by using nonlinear kernel for training (Hu et al., 2004), or
by optimization using rapid iterations through a physical conver—
gence function (Thomas and Dill, 1996).

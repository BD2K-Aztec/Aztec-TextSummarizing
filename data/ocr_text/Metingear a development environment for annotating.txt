ABSTRACT

Summary: Genome-scale metabolic models often lack annotations
that would allow them to be used for further analysis. Previous efforts
have focused on associating metabolites in the model with a cross
reference, but this can be problematic if the reference is not freely
available, multiple resources are used or the metabolite is added
from a literature review. Associating each metabolite with chemical
structure provides unambiguous identification of the components
and a more detailed view of the metabolism. We have developed an
open-source desktop application that simpliﬁes the process of adding
database cross references and chemical structures to genome-scale
metabolic models. Annotated models can be exported to the Systems
Biology Markup Language open interchange format.

Availability: Source code, binaries, documentation and tutorials are
freely available at http://Johnmay.github.com/metingear. The applica-
tion is implemented in Java with bundles available for MS Windows
and Macintosh OS X.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-scale metabolic models have proved useful in areas such
as growth optimization and metabolic engineering (Thiele and
Palsson, 2010). The time required to generate a reconstruction
has decreased with improvements in automatic pipelines, such as
the popular model-SEED (Henry et al., 2010). Despite rapid
improvements in automation, extensive manual curation is still
required for an accurate model. Common practice is to down-
load the draft reconstruction and curate the model in a text-
based spreadsheet, adding missing reactions from multiple data-
bases and literature reviews. Although recent models are also
published in Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)
(Hucka et al., 2010), the spreadsheets contain additional anno-
tations that are not transferred to the SBML annotation model.
The main advantage of the annotations is that they allow iden-
tiﬁcation of the components in a model. Identifying which com-
ponents are present allows it to be integrated and analyzed with

other resources, such as metabolomics experiments, without add-
itional effort to map the components between datasets.

The large number of components in genome-scale models
means comprehensive annotation is time-consuming. For metab-
olites, these annotations constitute a cross reference to a chemical
or a metabolic pathway database. Although this can help to
identify what the metabolite is, there are limitations: (i) if the
metabolite was added from a literature review, the reference
dataset may not contain that entity, (ii) the reference dataset
contains the entity but at a different protonation state (the
protonation state of the entry is important, as conservation of
mass and charge is a requirement for constraint-based analysis)
and (iii) the reference databases are closed access or no longer
fully accessible. The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2012) is frequently used as a starting
point for models, but a paid subscription is now required for
bulk access.

Chemical structure is already used in smaller models of meta-
bolic pathways where atom—atom mappings between reactions
are required for metabolic ﬂux analysis. The inclusion of full
chemical structure in a genome-scale metabolic model is advan-
tageous over only including a cross reference. The structure is
database independent and allows direct metabolite identiﬁcation.
A reference to any database can be inferred by searching for an
isomorphic structure. Identiﬁcation is required when incorporat-
ing several reference datasets. If no mapping exists, then add-
itional processing is required to identify similarities and overlap.
Integrating the chemical structure directly into the model facili-
tates this integration on demand. Reconciled databases (see
Reconciled Databases, Supplementary Material) primarily use
a structure representation to merge entities between datasets.
These requirements are most beneﬁcial as models grow larger.
The recent human reconstruction (Thiele et al., 2013) includes
IUPAC International Chemical Identiﬁer (InChI) structure rep-
resentations. The structure also allows identiﬁcation of metabol-
ites that cannot be referenced to an existing database. A
metabolite may be added from a literature review or identiﬁed
experimentally from a mass spectrum. Models may include small
peptide chains or fatty acids associated with the acyl carrier pro-
tein. These metabolites are not normally found in chemical data-
bases but can still be assigned a chemical structure. Subtleties of
metabolites and reactions can be expressed and interpreted from
the structure. Metabolites are often referred by their trivial name,
from which it is difﬁcult to determine such subtleties. In

particular, the full structure can unambiguously describe the
protonation state and the stereochemistry.

Thermodynamic constraints and Gibbs free energy of forma-
tion can be estimated and used to constrain a model (J ankowski
et al., 2008). To estimate these constraints, the chemical structure
is required.

We have created Metingear, a desktop application to assist in
the annotation of metabolic models using both manual and auto-
mated techniques. The main goal is to facilitate the integration of
chemical structure into genome-scale models.

2 EXISTING SOFTWARE

Desktop tools that can speciﬁcally provide annotation of model
components include Pathway Tools (Karp et al., 2010), the
SuBliMinaL Toolbox (Swainston et al., 2011), Metannogen
(Gille et al., 2011) and GEnome-scale Metabolic models
Simulation, Reconstruction and Visualization (GEMSiRV)
(Liao et al., 2012).

Pathway Tools provides a comprehensive framework for
creating and querying models. Components can be annotated
with a cross reference to multiple databases, but these cannot
be exported to SBML. Chemical structure can be included with
metabolites, but it must be added manually for each entry.

The SuBliMinaL Toolbox allows the import of models from
KEGG, MetaCyc (Karp et al., 2010) and SBML. The toolbox
can annotate compartments, metabolites and enzymes and merge
models together using normalized annotations to the Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) ontology (Hastings et al.,
2013). The metabolite name is used to ﬁnd candidate cross ref-
erences, which are then added silently or selected from a list of
suggestions.

Metannogen allows manual editing of annotations in SBML
ﬁles locally and via a group annotation server; no assistance is
provided for creating new annotations.

GEMSiRV provides construction, simulation and visualiza-
tion of metabolic models. GEMSiRV allows import of models
from a spreadsheet, provided the required columns are in the
correct order. Annotations are ﬁxed for each metabolic entity
only allowing cross referencing to two speciﬁc resources.
Annotations are neither automated nor exported to SBML.

3 KEY FEATURES

Metingear can import existing models from SBML, KEGG
Markup Language (http://www.kegg.jp/kegg/xml/) and
Microsoft Excel spreadsheets. Genes, gene products and anno-
tations from a partial or fully assembled genome can also be
imported (see Additional Features, Supplementary Material).
Metingear provides a dynamic annotation system
(Supplementary Table S1) allowing each entity to hold multiple
annotations of the same type. The application allows annotation
of multiple cross references and is not coupled to a speciﬁc re-
source like other tools. If available, each new cross reference is
automatically encoded with Minimum Information Required in
the Annotation of Models (MIRIAM) registry (J uty et al., 2012)
information, which semantically describes the cross reference
allowing interoperability with other tools. The resource to
which a reference is referring can be inferred for manually

entered identiﬁers, improving usability when adding cross refer-
ences. Reactions can be entered via a reaction equation, and
individual reaction participants can be added, modiﬁed and
removed allowing for the representation of novel reactions.

Internally, Metingear uses the Chemistry Development Kit
(Steinbeck et al., 2003) to represent and manipulate chemical
structure. Multiple methods are used to attain a metabolite
that is annotated with a chemical structure (Fig. 1). If a cross
reference is available, a local or web service can be used to attach
the structure. To improve performance, Metingear can create a
local searchable index for data from multiple resources (see
Services, Supplementary Material). Cross references can be im-
ported directly from annotated SBML annotations or spread-
sheet columns. Annotations, including cross references, can be
extracted from notes provided by SBML input; recent models
may provide a chemical structure in line notations (International
Chemical Identiﬁer), which can also be transferred. If there are
no cross references available for import, a name search can be
used to ﬁnd a reference from a user-selected resource. As in the
SuBliMinaL Toolbox, entries can be silently assigned if there is
no difference in name or selected from a ranked list of candi-
dates. If no cross reference can be found, the structure can be
attached manually from several ﬁle formats or created semiauto-
matically. Dipeptides are often found in reconstructions that
model peptidoglycan synthesis, but a chemical structure database
may only provide entries for the individual residues. Dipeptide
and polypeptide structures can be automatically created by
matching the metabolite name.

Errors and inconsistency checks are provided to ensure a
robust model. Annotation of several published models identiﬁed
some missing information that could not be found in the native
spreadsheets (see Inconsistencies, Supplementary Material).

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The chemical structure can be used to merge metabolites and re-
actions in reconciled databases. Metingear allows multiple model
formats to be annotated and standardized for creation of custom
datasets and analysis. Future directions include extending the as-
sisted structure drawing to uniquely represent more metabolites,
such as acyl carrier protein-associated fatty acids. Substructure
searching and tools to compare the chemical diversity in and be-
tween metabolic models will also be integrated. With many

reconstruction pipelines already available, future work will pri-
marily focus on model analysis and bridging the chemical gap
between manual curation and the draft reconstruction.

Abstract

Summary: In next generation sequencing (NGS)—based genetic studies, researchers typically
perform genotype calling first and then apply standard genotype—based methods for association
testing. However, such a two—step approach ignores genotype calling uncertainty in the association
testing step and may incur power loss and/or inflated type—l error. In the recent literature, a few ro—
bust and efficient likelihood based methods including both likelihood ratio test (LRT) and score test
have been proposed to carry out association testing without intermediate genotype calling. These
methods take genotype calling uncertainty into account by directly incorporating genotype likeli—
hood function (GLF) of NGS data into association analysis. However, existing LRT methods are
computationally demanding or do not allow covariate adjustment; while existing score tests are
not applicable to markers with low minor allele frequency (MAF). We provide an LRT allowing
flexible covariate adjustment, develop a statistically more powerful score test and propose a
combination strategy (UNC combo) to leverage the advantages of both tests. We have carried out
extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of our proposed LRT and score test.
Simulations and real data analysis demonstrate the advantages of our proposed combination strat—
egy: it offers a satisfactory trade—off in terms of computational efficiency, applicability (accommo—
dating both common variants and variants with low MAF) and statistical power, particularly for the
analysis of quantitative trait where the power gain can be up to ~60% when the causal variant is of
low frequency (MAF < 0.01 ).

Bamshad et al., 2011; Goldstein et al., 2013; Haack et al., 2010;
Kiezun et al., 2012; Lange et al., 2014; Torgerson et al., 2012).
Most association testing methods are designed for genotypes, which
are not directly available from NGS data. Thus, to perform associ—
ation testing on NGS data, researchers typically perform genotype
calling first (Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2009, 2011; McKenna
et al., 2010; Mechanic et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). There are
multiple sources of non—negligible error in NGS data, such as base—
calling error and assembly or alignment error (Lee and Zhao, 2013;
Li et al., 2012; Nielsen et al., 2011), each of which can cause consid—
erable uncertainty in genotype calling. To take these various sources
of error into account, many existing genotype calling algorithms
adopt a probabilistic framework and generate genotype likelihood
functions (GLF). Currently, accurate genotype calling can be
achieved from GLF data either with high depth sequencing, or with
low depth sequencing if a large number of individuals are sequenced
(Kang et al., 2013; Li et al., 2009, 2010, 2011, 2012; Nielsen et al.,
2011; Pasaniuc et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2014; Zhi et al., 2012;
Zollner, 2012). However, genotype calling can incur a number of
problems, particularly when served as an intermediate step for asso—
ciation testing or inference in population genetics. First, uncertainty
in genotype calls is ultimately lost in subsequent inference, leading
to possible power loss. Second, for low coverage sequencing data,
multi-sample lineage disequilibrium (LD) aware methods can be
rather computationally intensive. Third, the dependence of
genotype calling on LD pattern may lead to potential bias in popula—
tion genetics inference (Li, 2011). Lastly, both uncertainty (particu—
larly differential uncertainty across varying values of phenotypic
traits) and inconsistencies in called genotypes may result in inflated
type—I error in association testing (Hong et al., 2012), particularly
when combined from multiple datasets of varying sequencing
depths.

In the literature, as an attractive alternative to the two—step test—
ing approach (i.e. genotype calling in the first step and association
testing based on called genotypes in the second step), computation—
ally efficient one—step methods have been proposed for association
analysis that directly model sequencing data for association testing
without the intermediate genotype calling step. These one—step
methods test association by incorporating GLF into the association
testing likelihood function and carrying out likelihood based associ—
ation inference (focusing primarily on testing) without explicitly
calling genotypes (Derkach et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2010, 2011; Li,
2011; Satten, 2013; Skotte et al., 2012). Among them, Kim et al.
(2010, 2011) and Li (2011) test allele frequency difference between
cases and controls via likelihood ratio test (LRT). However, LRT
requires numerical optimization under both the null and the alterna—
tive hypothesis and is therefore computationally demanding for
large—scale datasets. Furthermore, existing LRT methods are
designed only for binary traits and do not allow covariates adjust—
ment. Skotte et al. (2012) adopt a generalized linear model (GLM)
framework to accommodate both quantitative and binary traits and
to allow covariates with a motivation conceptually similar to the
one proposed for haplotype association testing (Schaid et al., 2002).
Skotte et al. (2012) sketch the possibility of an LRT, where they
envision a two—step approach that first estimates MAF based on a
partial likelihood without phenotype information and then plugs the
estimated MAF into the likelihood function to carry out association
testing. However, the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) of
MAF in the two—step approach is not the oracle estimator (details to
follow) and thus may incur power loss in subsequent association
testing. Skotte et al. (2012) develop a computationally efficient score
test (abbreviated as SKA score test hereafter) within the GLM

framework; however, the information matrix used for the construc—
tion of the SKA score test ignores the correlation between the MAF
estimator and estimators for the regression parameters, likely caus—
ing the SKA score test statistically underpowered. Moreover, the
score test is generally not applicable when MAF is low (Satten,
2013; Skotte et al., 2012) because the minimal degree of variation in
log-likelihood function required for numerical stability of score test
statistic cannot be reached. Type—I error inflation was reported in
the original work for MAF under 0.01 (Skotte et al., 2012). For the
same reason, a variation of the SKA score test developed particularly
for accommodating publicly available control groups (Derkach
et al., 2014) also adopts 0.01 as MAF threshold.

In this paper, we first provide an LRT for association analysis of
NGS data (UNC LRT), which allows covariate adjustment and han—
dles both quantitative and binary phenotypic traits. In our LRT, the
statistically efficient MLE of MAF is obtained in one unified frame-
work that simultaneously estimates MAF and association param—
eters. Second, we improve upon the work of Skotte et al. (2012) by
considering the correlation between MAF estimator and regression
parameter estimators in the information matrix and develop a statis—
tically more powerful score test (UNC score test). Third, although
LRT and score test are asymptomatically equivalent, it is well
known that their performance can differ considerably in practice.
We evaluate the performance of our proposed LRT and score test by
simulations and propose a combination strategy to take advantage
of both tests (hereafter, referred to as UNC Combo). Extensive
simulations and real data based analysis are carried out to examine
the robustness, computational efficiency and statistical power of
SKA score test, UNC score test, UNC LRT and UNC Combo. Our
results suggest advantages of UNC combo in practice when genetic
architecture (in particular, MAF of associated or causal genetic
variant(s)) is unknown, particularly for quantitative traits. In our
simulations, we observe gains in power up to 60% with losses of
less than 8% across a wide range of scenarios considered, when
using UNC Combo. In our real data based simulations, UNC
Combo is able to identify all causal SNPs while other methods miss
at least one.

2 Methods

2.1 Joint likelihood function
Suppose that a total of 11 individuals are sequenced and m SNPs are
discovered. Further assume that all m SNPs are biallelic and auto—
somal. For the ith individual, let D,- be the observed sequencing data
and Y,- the quantitative or binary phenotypic trait of interest,
X,- : {Xib j : 1, . . . , d} the vector of d covariates and Gik the unob—
served true genotype at the lath SNP. Our goal is to test whether the
lath SNP is associated with the trait of interest by performing single
marker association testing without explicit genotype calling.

Let pk denote MAF of the kthSNP. By Hardy—Weinberg equilib-
rium (HWE), f (Gik|pk), the probability of Gik, follows a binomial
distribution Binom(2, pk). For a quantitative or binary trait Y), we
capture the dependence of Y,- on Gik and X,- through a GLM in the
same way as in Skotte et al. (2012). Specifically, the probability
density function of Y,- takes the following form:

The joint log-likelihood function of the parameters
{or : (oco,oc1),ﬂ, ¢,pk} given 0 : {Y,-,D,-,X,-,z' : 1,  ,n} can be

written as:

flog Z {f(Yz-|Xz, Git; a, is, ¢)f(Dzlek)f(sz; pa}

G,k€(0,1,2)
where f (Di|G,-k) is the GLF from NGS data. To test whether the lath
SNP is associated with phenotypic trait of interest, the null hypoth-

esis is H0 : ﬂ = 0. This can be done using likelihood based testing
methods such as an LRT or score test.

2.2 A powerful LRT statistic
Skotte et al. (2012) sketch the possibility of a two—step
LRT approach to test the H0 above: (step 1) pk is estimated

by maximizing a partial log-likelihood function
Zlog Z (Di|G,-k)f(G,-k;pk)} without taking any pheno—
i=1 G,ke(0,1,2)

type information into account; (step 2) estimator of pk from step 1,
[3],, is plugged into Equation (2) where an LRT can be carried out.
However, step 1 ignores the correlation between Y,- and D,- and thus
[3,, obtained in step 1 is not the oracle estimator of pk under the al—
ternative hypothesis, which can consequently render the LRT in step
2 underpowered.

Here, we propose a statistically more powerful LRT (hereafter
referred to as UNC LRT) to test H0 : ﬂ : 0 by maximizing the log-
likelihood function l(oc, ﬂ, d), pk|O) in Equation (2) in one single step.
Specifically, UNC LRT statistic is

'nmcuu==—uu%ﬂ=«L%5uO)—Keﬁ¢%ﬁuou (a

where {d, E), 5k} (MLEs of {oc, d), pk} under the null) are obtained by
maximizing l(oc,ﬂ : 0,¢,pk|O) and {6c,i3,d),j3k} (MLEs of
{oc,ﬂ,¢,pk} under the alternative) by maximizing l(oc,ﬂ,¢,pk|0).
Existing optimization functionalities such as optim() function in R
can be used to maximize the log—likelihood functions above. The
TUNC LRT statistic asymptotically follows a 12 distribution with 1
degree of freedom.

2.3 Improved score test statistic (UNC score test)
The score test is appealing because parameters only need to be esti—
mated under H0. Under H0 : ﬂ : 0,

1(a7ﬂ : 07¢7Pklo)

z=1 G,ke(0,1,2)
(4)

Consequently, {oc, d), pk} can be estimated separately: [3,, (MLE of pk
under H0) can be estimated by only optimizing the second part of
the Equation (4); {§, ¢} (MLEs of {oc, ¢}) can thus be easily obtained
by applying starndard GLM algorithms on the first part of Equation

(4). The time-consuming numerical optimization over the entire par—
ameter space is thus avoided. Our score test statistic (hereafter
referred to as UNC score test) takes the following form:

N N N
N N N N

TUNC  = 5082.13 = 0, world, I3 = 0, wow, ﬂ = 0, ML.)
(5)

where S (or, ﬂ, d), pk) is the score function (the first—order derivative of
the log-likelihood fgnction) and S(&, ﬂ = 0, d313,) is its value eval—
uated at {82,13 2 o,¢,;§k} (MLE under H0 : [3 = 0). I(oc,ﬂ,¢,pk) is
the observed information matrix (the second derivative of
the log-likelihood function, mulitpliedbe —1) and I(&, ﬂ = 0, ¢,;k)
is its value evaluated at {55, ﬂN2N0, ¢,5k}. Skotte et al. (2012)
ignor the correlation between 55, ﬂ, d) and 5,, and SKA score test stat—
1st1c1s:

Tm  = 5%, 13 = 0, 301%, 13 = 0, 30502.13 = 0, QE) (6)

The information matrix in Equation (6) contains only the second
derivative with respect to or, ﬂ, d). It can be verified that

TUN C score 2 TSKA score - 

Thus SKA score test is therefore theoretically less powerful than
UNC score test. Details for the UNC score statistic and the proof of
inequality (7) can be found in supplementary materials.

As manifested in Equations (5) and (6), both the UNC and SKA
score test statistics involve the inverse of the information matrix
I _1(-). In practical settings, a very small pk would lead to little vari—
ation in the log-likelihood function, which may cause I to be ill—
conditioned. Consequently, 1‘1  may become numerically unstable
which could result in inﬂated type—I error (Skotte et al., 2012). The
practical implication is that these score test statistics cannot be
blindly applied without MAF threshold (Derkach et al., 2014;
Skotte et al., 2012).

2.4 Combination strategy (UNC combo)

We propose a practical combination strategy (UNC combo) which
combines the strengths of the two UNC tests to achieve a good bal—
ance between computational efficiency, applicability (over the entire
MAF spectrum) and statistical power. Denote the MAF of a SNP by
[9. UNC combo performs UNC score test when p > ptbresbold and
UNC LRT when pgpmskold. UNC combo enjoys the advantages of
UNC score test and UNC LRT in that: (i) it carries out UNC LRT
only for SNPs with pgpmsbold and is thus computationally more ef—
ficient than UNC LRT; and (ii) unlike UNC score test, which fails to
control type—I error for low frequency SNPs (details to follow), we
can apply UNC combo over the entire MAF spectrum. In practice, p
can be estimated by optimizing the second part of Equation (4) be—
fore UNC combo is applied.

3 Simulations

We perform extensive simulation studies under a range of settings to
evaluate the performance of SKA score test, UNC score test, UNC
LRT and UNC combo. We use COSI’s bestfit model to generate a
100-kb region that mimics LD pattern, local recombination rate and
population history of Europeans through a coalescent model
(Schaffner et al., 2005). Within the region, 45 000 chromosomes are
generated. We consider two baseline covariates: a binary covariate
X1 sampled from Bernoulli distribution with a success probability of
0.5 and a continuous covariate X2 sampled from standard normal

distribution. Quantitative trait values are generated via a simple lin—
ear regression model:

Y=O€0+O€1X1+O€2X2+ﬂck+8

where oco : 1, a1 = 1, 062 = 1 and 8 follows a standard normal distri—
bution. Binary trait values are generated via a logistic regression model:

lOg it(Prob(Y = 1)) = 060 + O€1X1 + 0(2X2 + ﬂGk

where oco : —3.65 (trait with 2.5% prevalence), a1 = 1 and
062 : 1. Under the null hypothesis, 10 000 replicates are generated to
evaluate Type—I errors. We evaluate type—I errors for three sample
sizes: 500, 1000 and 2000. Under the alternative hypothesis, we as—
sume one causal SNP and specify three MAFs for the causal SNP:
0.006, 0.011 (so that it is slightly above the MAF threshold) and
0.02. For each MAF, 1000 replicates each with sample size 1000 are
generated. Sequencing data are simulated using ShotGun (Kang
et al., 2013) with a per base pair error rate of 0.5%. Average
sequencing depths (d) are chosen to be 2X, 4X, 10X and 30X to
cover a wide range of depth scenarios.

3.1 Simulation results

We conduct our first series of simulation studies to evaluate SKA score
test, UNC score test and UNC LRT when only one SNP is tested.
Type—I errors across all scenarios of sample sizes and sequencing
depths are displayed in Tables 1, 2 and in Supplementary Tables S1—
S4 with significant threshold 1e—4. Intuitively, MAF threshold to
achieve controlled Type—I error may vary with sample size and/or
sequencing depth. Our simulations show that MAF threshold of 20 / 2
11 would be conservative enough to control type—I errors across a wide
spectrum of scenarios. For example in Tables 1 and 2, type-I errors of
the two score tests are well controlled for all sequencing depths if
13 > ﬁbres/701d : 0.01 ([3 is the MAF estimate). The severity of
type-I error inﬂation varies by sequencing depth d and ptbresbold: the
lower d and ptbresbold are, the greater the inﬂation of type—I error is.
That is because a lower sequencing depth and a smaller p cause the
information matrix to be more ill—conditioned and result in a more nu—
merically unstable score test statistic (more details in the Section 5).
The calculation of UNC LRT statistic involves only the subtraction of
two log—likelihoods and is fairly stable even when variation in log-like-
lihoods is small. As can be seen, the type—I errors of the UNC LRT are
all controlled, even when all SNPs are included (ptbresbold : 0).

 

Note: Signiﬁcant threshold is 1e — 4. Sample size n = 1000.
Grey marks inﬂated type-I errors.

Supplementary Figures Sl—S6 present the power results of single
SNP testing for quantitative and binary trait, with MAF of the
causal SNP taking three values: 0.006, 0.011 and 0.02. MAF
thresholds for score tests are chosen based on Tables 1 and 2 to as—
sure control of type—I errors (ptbresbold : 0.01). Powers of association
tests based on dosage after multi—sample LD aware calling are also
provided for comparison. For a quantitative trait, UNC LRT outper—
forms the two score tests by a large margin (up to ~95%) when
p g ptbresbold or p % pthresbold, which is expected since the causal
SNP(s) would be filtered out by a score test if [3 < ptbresbold. For a
binary trait, the powers of the score tests are maintained even if
pgptbmbold. This is because the causal allele is enriched among cases,
making [3 > ptbresbold. Overall, the performance of UNC score test is
always slightly better than or at least comparable to that of SKA
score test under various scenarios.

In practice, causal SNPs are unknown and we need to test all
SNPs in the genetic region(s) of interest. The second series of simula—
tion studies are therefore devoted to investigating the performance
of SKA score test, UNC score test and UNC LRT when multiple
SNPs are tested. The two score tests are carried out only for SNPs
satisfying [3 > ptbresbold. Meanwhile, UNC LRT is applied on all
SNPs. The type—I errors of these methods across all scenarios are dis—
played in Tables 3, 4 and in Supplementary Tables 85—88 for quanti—
tative and binary traits, respectively. We use a Bonferroni correction
to control type—I errors. As can be seen, type—I errors of UNC LRT
are well controlled across the entire spectrum of sequencing depths
and sample sizes without MAF filtering. Therefore, UNC LRT is
generally more robust than the two score tests and more appropriate
for the entire MAF spectrum. Similar to the single SNP testing series,
the two score tests have controlled type—I errors when [3 > ptbresbold
: 0.02 for n : 500, [3 > ptbresbold = 0.01 for n = 1000 and
[3 > ptmgwld = 0.005 for n = 2000.

Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures 87—811 present the statis—
tical power in this second series of simulations. Similar to the single
SNP testing series: if ptbresbold > [Jamal (e.g. [Jamal : 0.006) for a
quantitative trait, UNC LRT is much more powerful than UNC
score test; when the trait is binary, the powers of the two UNC tests
are comparable. If ptbresbold < pews“), UNC score test is more power—
ful than UNC LRT under most scenarios for both quantitative and
binary traits. Finally, the power of UNC score test is usually slightly
better than or at least comparable to that of the SKA score test under
all scenarios (e.g. [Jamal : 0.006, d : 2X for a binary trait). The
extent to which UNC score test improves over SKA score test

depends on the nature of the underlying association. In Appendix F,
we demonstrate a scenario in which the UNC score test outperforms
SKA score test by up to ~15 % by letting the effect of causal SNP de—
pend on covariates.

Now, we focus on the performance of UNC Combo in both series
of simulations described above. As demonstrated in Tables 1—4 and
Supplementary Tables 81—88, type—I errors of UNC combo are all well
controlled with ptbresbold(20/2n). Statistical power results of UNC
combo are also presented in Figure 1 and Supplementary Figures S1—
811. Note that UNC combo is most effective for quantitative traits: it
outperforms at least one of the two other UNC tests under all scen—
arios. By using UNC combo instead of the UNC score test, power
gain can be as high as ~90% (d = 30 and MAF : 0.006 in single
SNP testing series [Supplementary Fig. 81]) and ~70%
(d = 30 and MAF : 0.006 in multiple testing series [Fig. 1]) with
minimal loss (~8%) (d : 4 and MAF : 0.02 in the multiple test—
ing series [Supplementary Fig. 88]). For binary trait simulations, UNC
combo is uniformly the least powerful test, even when the causal
MAF is small. In fact, as aforementioned, case—control design makes [3
much larger than p and thus causal SNPs with small p are less likely
to be filtered out and missed by score tests (discussions regarding
using controls only to estimate MAF can be found in the Section 5 ).
Therefore, the ability of UNC combo to include all SNPs becomes less
necessary for binary traits and the added noise becomes the dominat—
ing consequence. In summary, we recommend UNC combo with
ptbresbold (20 / 211) for quantitative traits and UNC score test with
ptbresbold (20 / 211) for binary traits.

Table 5 presents the comparison of computational costs of SKA
score test, the three UNC methods and dosage—based test when
sequencing depth d : 4X. As displayed in Table 5, 33%—41% of
computation cost can be saved by adopting UNC combo instead of
UNC LRT. In practice, we usually have little prior knowledge re—
garding the MAFs of the causal SNPs and thus UNC combo can
achieve a reasonable trade—off between power and computational
burden for quantitative traits.

The average number of SNPs in one simulated genetic region is
N762 when d : 4X. “quanti” is abbreviation for quantitative.

Lausanne (Switzerland) are sequenced at relatively high depth (me—
dium depth ~27X) in the exons of 202 genes (Firmann et al., 2008;
Nelson et al., 2012). 7 genes on chromosome X are excluded from
drug related analysis. A total of 22 992 SNPs are discovered across the
195 autosomal genes among the 1956 subjects. Three SNPs
(G1, G2 and G3) on chromosomes 1, 6 and 8 are chosen to be casual
with [Jamal : 0.004, 0.01 and 0.15, respectively. Quantitative
trait is generated by

Y = 060 +0€1X1 + 062X2 +ﬂ1G1 +ﬂ2G2 +ﬂ3G3 +8

where X1,X2 and 8 are generated in the same way as in the simula—
tion study. oco : a1 = a2 = 1, ﬂl : 1.8, ﬂz : 1 and ﬂ3 : 0.16.
Moreover, data of two different sequencing depths are simulated by
(i) choosing 1 out of every 5 short reads (“Divided by 5” where
6574 SNPs are detected); (ii) choosing 1 out of every 10 short reads
(“Divided by 10” where 4255 SNPs are detected). As in the simula—
tion study, we pick ptbresbold : 0.005 for score tests and UNC combo
when trait is quantitative. Bonferroni correction is adopted to con—
trol type—I error.

Manhattan plots of association test statistics based on SKA score
test, UNC score test, UNC LRT and UNC combo are displayed in
Supplementary Figure 812. As shown in Supplementary Figure S12,
the two score tests perform similarly and both outperform UNC
LRT when pcausal > ptbresbold. On the other hand, UNC LRT can
identify causal SNPs with [Jamal < ptbresbold. As expected, UNC
combo combines the advantages of UNC score test and UNC LRT
and is more powerful than both under the realistic setting where
MAFs of the causal SNPs are unknown. Take “Divided by 5” as an
example: first, none of the methods result in any false positives; se—
cond, UNC score test identifies G2 (pcausal > pthresbold) while UNC
LRT fails to; on the other hand, UNC LRT successfully identified
G1 (pcausal < ptbresbold); third, UNC combo successfully detects
both G1 and G2; finally, “Divided by 5” is more powerful than
“Divided by 10”, which is expected as statistical power for associ—
ation testing decreases with sequencing depth.

5 Discussion

Association testing using NGS data without genotype calling is an
appealing approach. This approach not only avoids the potentially
computationally intensive genotype calling step but also carries all
of the information from sequencing into association, in contrast to

at least some information loss with an intermediate genotype calling
step. Population structure and other potential confounding factors
are almost inevitable in GWAS studies and need to be adjusted for.
In this article, we develop UNC score test and UNC LRT to allow
covariate adjustment in association testing based on GLFs. Both
UNC score test and UNC LRT directly incorporate the uncertainty
of the observed sequencing data into analysis by constructing likeli-
hood function based on GLFs and do not require explicit genotype
calling. Instead of a two step approach (Skotte et al., 2012), UNC
LRT produces MLE of MAF together with MLEs of regression par—
ameters in one step and thus is theoretically more powerful. The
UNC score test improves upon the previous work of Skotte et al.
(2012) by taking into account the correlation between regression
parameter estimators and MAF estimator.

Using simulations, we have demonstrated that UNC score test is
generally statistically more powerful than, or at least comparable to,

SKA score test. UNC score test is computationally faster than UNC
LRT because score test only involves the model under the null hy-
pothesis and does not require time—consuming optimization. On the
other hand, in practice, UNC LRT can be applied to SNPs over the
entire MAF spectrum while UNC score test can only be applied to
SNPs with MAFs greater than certain threshold (pt/9,65%”) because
type—I errors of score tests are inflated without MAF filtering. We
therefore propose a combination strategy (UNC combo) to take ad—
vantage of the strengths of our two tests. As shown in simulation re-
sults for quantitative trait, UNC combo improves upon the two
UNC tests in three aspects: (i) it can be applied to all SNPs across
the entire MAF spectrum, a desirable feature inherited from UNC
LRT; (ii) it is computationally more efficient than UNC LRT, be—
cause LRT is calculated only for SNPs with MAF below pthresbold;
(iii) it manifests higher statistical power than at least one of the two
UNC tests. In the real data analysis, UNC combo outperforms both

UNC LRT and UNC score test for simulated quantitative traits. For
the reasons above, we recommend UNC combo when the trait(s) of
interest is/are quantitative. For binary traits, UNC score test outper—
forms other methods and is thus recommended.

MAF and variation in log—likelihood function are two factors po—
tentially correlated with the inﬂation of type—I error of the score test.
We fit regression models to investigate the relationship among them.
We use the determinant of the information matrix as a measure of
variation in the log-likelihood function. A linear regression analysis
shows that UNC score test statistic is negatively associated with the
determinant of information matrix (P-value<2e—16). Moreover,
another linear regression indicates that the determinant of the infor—
mation matrix is positively associated with MAF (P—value < 2e—16).
Consequently, the lower the MAF of a SNP, the more ill—conditioned
the information matrix becomes and the more likely to result in
inﬂated type—I error.

For a simulated binary trait, we also evaluate an alternative ap—
proach to filter out SNPs for the score tests: namely, estimating
MAFs using only controls and filtering SNPs based on control MAF
estimation. Simulation results show that this approach may lead to
inﬂated type—I error (e.g. type—I error is 0.265 for UNC score test
and 0.132 for SKA score test with pthmbold : 0.01, d = 2 and
n = 1000). This is because MAFs of rare variants tent to be over—
estimated when only controls are used in estimation (Li and Leal,
2009; Liu and Leal, 2012; Yan and Li, 2014). For example, the
MAF estimate of ascertained singletons in controls would be double
of its true value (assuming equal numbers of cases and controls) if
only controls were used to estimate the MAF. These unwarrantedly
retained rare variants consequently lead to numerical instability and
eventually to inﬂated type—I errors.

In Appendix F, we introduce correlation between MAF estimator
and association parameter estimators by letting the effect of the
causal SNP depend on covariates. In real data, this can be observed
due to gene environment interactions. Under the scenario, UNC
score test outperforms SKA score test by up to ~15%. In practice,
non-negligible correlation between MAF and association parameters
estimators can arise in various and unknown ways. It is thus desir—
able to have a theoretically more powerful score test (UNC score
test) to guard against such scenarios where correlation among MAF
and regression parameters is non-negligible.

The optimal MAF threshold depends on the genetic architecture
(number, MAFs and effect sizes of the causal SNPs), which is gener—
ally unknown. This threshold also depends on the sample size (n)
and sequencing depth. To err on the conservative side, we choose
ptbresbold : 20 / 2n as adopted in the literature (Derkach et al., 2014;
Skotte et al., 2012) and as supported by our own simulation results.
In the future, an optimal threshold might be derived by taking
sequencing depth into account. Moreover, differential sequencing
depths between cases and controls introduce additional biases, lead—
ing to inﬂated type—I error of SKA as shown in Derkach et al.
(2014). Future work is desired to study the impact of differential
sequencing depths on our proposed UNC tests. Lastly, while the cur—
rent work focuses on single variant association, extension to rare
variant association testing is highly warranted given the higher level
of uncertainty in genotype calling for rarer variants.

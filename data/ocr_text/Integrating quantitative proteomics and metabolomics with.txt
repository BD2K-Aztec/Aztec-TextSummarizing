ABSTRACT

Motivation: The availability of modern sequencing techniques has
led to a rapid increase in the amount of reconstructed metabolic
networks. Using these models as a platform for the analysis
of high throughput transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic
data can provide valuable insight into conditional changes in
the metabolic activity of an organism. While transcriptomics and
proteomics provide important insights into the hierarchical regulation
of metabolic flux, metabolomics shed light on the actual enzyme
activity through metabolic regulation and mass action effects.
Here we introduce a new method, termed integrative omics-
metabolic analysis (IOMA) that quantitatively integrates proteomic
and metabolomic data with genome-scale metabolic models, to
more accurately predict metabolic flux distributions. The method is
formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem that seeks a
steady-state flux distribution in which flux through reactions with
measured proteomic and metabolomic data, is as consistent as
possible with kinetically derived flux estimations.

Results: IOMA is shown to successfully predict the metabolic state
of human erythrocytes (compared to kinetic model simulations),
showing a significant advantage over the commonly used methods
flux balance analysis and minimization of metabolic adjustment.
Thereafter, IOMA is shown to correctly predict metabolic fluxes
in Escherichia coli under different gene knockouts for which both
metabolomic and proteomic data is available, achieving higher
prediction accuracy over the extant methods. Considering the
lack of high-throughput flux measurements, while high-throughput
metabolomic and proteomic data are becoming readily available, we
expect IOMA to significantly contribute to future research of cellular
metabolism.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern genome—sequencing capabilities have led to the generation
of genome—scale metabolic network reconstructions for many
microorganisms, giving rise to more than 50 highly curated
metabolic reconstructions that have been published to date (Duarte
et al., 2004; Feist and Palsson, 2008). A metabolic network
reconstruction is composed of a set of biochemical reactions,
and the associations between these reactions and their enzyme—
coding genes. The constraint—based modeling (CBM) computational
framework serves to analyze the functionality of these genome scale

models, enabling the prediction of various metabolic phenotypes
in microorganism such as growth rates, nutrient uptake rates, by—
product secretions and gene essentiality (Price et al., 2004). CBM
has been used for a variety of applications including the comparative
metabolic analyses over multiple organisms (Blank et al., 2005; Lee
et al., 2009), drug discovery (Gordana et al., 2005), metabolic ﬂux
analysis (Rantanen et al., 2008), studies of network evolution (Fong
et al., 2005) and metabolic engineering tasks (Pharkya et al., 2004).

Using metabolic models as scaffolds for the analysis of
high throughput data such as transcriptomics, proteomics and
metabolomics suggests the possibility of inferring condition—
dependent changes in the metabolic activity of an organism.
Developing computational methods capable of predicting metabolic
ﬂux by integrating these data sources with a metabolic network
is hence a major challenge of metabolic network modeling.
Previous investigations have already utilized CBM to integrate
high—throughput molecular datasets with a metabolic network in a
qualitative manner: The methods developed by Akes son et al. (2004)
and Becker and Palsson (2008) use gene expression data to identify
genes that are absent or likely to be absent in certain contexts.
They then search for metabolic states that prevent (or minimize) the
ﬂux through the associated metabolic reactions. A recent method
by Shlomi et al. (2008) considers data on both lowly and highly
expressed genes in a given context, as cues for the likelihood that
their associated reactions carry metabolic ﬂux and employs CBM
to accumulate these cues into a global, consistent prediction of the
metabolic state. The lack of dependency on a cellular objective is a
marked advantage of this approach as the latter is difﬁcult to deﬁne
for multi—cellular organisms.

While transcriptomics and proteomics data provides important
insight into hierarchical regulation of metabolic ﬂux (representing
the control over the maximum activity of enzymes—i.e. vmax),
metabolomics may provide information on an additional level of
regulation called, metabolic regulation (Rossell et al., 2006). The
latter denotes the effect of metabolite concentrations on actual
enzyme activity through mass action, kinetic and allosteric effects.
A previous CBM method for integrating metabolomic data with
a metabolic network model, thermodynamic—based metabolic ﬂux
analysis (TMFA) (Henry et al., 2007), derives constraints on
reaction directionality from metabolite concentration data based
on thermodynamic principles. Another method by Cakir et al.
(2006) integrates quantitative metabolome data with genome—scale
models to identify reporter reactions, deﬁned as the set of reactions
that respond to genetic or environmental perturbations through
coordinated variations in the levels of surrounding metabolites.
Currently, however, there is no CBM method that enables the

integration of quantitative metabolomic data with a metabolic
network model to directly infer the metabolic ﬂuxes themselves.

In this article we introduce a novel CBM method, integrative
omics—metabolic analysis (IOMA), for integrating quantitative
proteomic and metabolomic data with genome—scale metabolic
network models to predict metabolic ﬂux. This is achieved primarily
by considering a mechanistic model of reaction rates. The method is
formulated as a quadratic programming (QP) problem (Nocedal and
Wright, 2006) geared to ﬁnd a feasible, steady—state ﬂux distribution,
such that: (i) a set of stoichiometric mass—balance and enzymatic
directionality constraints are satisﬁed; (ii) the ﬂux through a core set
of reactions for which measured proteomic and metabolomic data
exists is as consistent as possible with ﬂux estimations derived via
Michaelis Menten—like kinetic rate equations for these reactions. The
latter involves the estimation of missing enzyme kinetic constants,
by searching for optimal parameters as part of the optimization
problem, as described below. To examine the predictive performance
of IOMA, we applied it to predict metabolic ﬂux for red blood
cells (RBC) for which a detailed kinetic model is available for
validation (utilizing it to simulate metabolic ﬂux changes following
gene knockouts based on artiﬁcially generated proteomic data).
As a further validation, we applied IOMA to predict metabolic
ﬂux for Escherichia coli under different gene knockouts, utilizing
available metabolomic and proteomic data as input, and available
experimental ﬂuxes for validation (Ishii, 2007). A comparison of
IOMA’s performance to that of the commonly used methods of ﬂux
balance analysis (FBA) (Fell and Small, 1986; Kauffman et al.,
2003; Varma and Palsson, 1994) and minimization of metabolic
adjustment (MOMA) (Segre et al., 2002) shows the signiﬁcant
advantage of IOMA in both validation tests.

2 METHODS
2.1 CBM of metabolic network

A metabolic network consisting of n metabolites and m reactions can be
represented by a stoichiometric matrix, denoted by N, where the entry nl-j
represents the stoichiometric coefﬁcient of metabolite i in reaction j (Price
et al., 2004). A CBM model imposes mass balance, directionality and ﬂux
capacity constraints on the space of possible ﬂuxes in the metabolic network’s
reactions through the set of linear equations:

Ni7=0, (1)

1711; < 17 S 17m), (2)

where 17 stands for the ﬂux vector for all of the reactions in the model (i.e.
the ﬂux distribution). The exchange of metabolites with the environment is
represented as a set of exchange reactions, enabling for a pre—deﬁned set of
metabolites to be either taken up or secreted from the growth media. The
steady—state assumption represented in Equation ( l) constrains the production
rate of each metabolite to be equal to its consumption rate. Enzymatic
directionality and ﬂux capacity constraints deﬁne lower and upper bounds on
the ﬂuxes and are embedded in Equation (2). In the following, ﬂux vectors
satisfying these conditions will be referred to as feasible stead—state ﬂux
distributions.

2.2 The IOMA method

To associate quantitative measurements of protein and metabolite levels with
metabolic ﬂuxes, we used the following Michaelis Menten—like rate equation
to estimate the ﬂux 17 in a reaction transforming a set of substrates S to a set

of products P:

S. _ p.
Harem—k..:..)-kcaveH(—‘ >, 
si€s ’ P

iep km,pi +191-

where S,- and P,- denote the concentrations for the i—th substrate and i—th
product, respectively, and e denotes the enzyme concentration. km,s,- and
km,p,- denote the dissociation constants for the i—th substrate and i—th product,
respectively. Enzyme turnover rates in the forward and backward directions
are denoted by kc; and ICC—at, respectively. Given the substrate and product
metabolites’ concentration and their dissociation constants, the following
saturation values for the enzyme in the forward and backward directions

can be computed as following:
_ = H ( Pi )
km 7pi i

Si
a+=u(—, ),
Sies m’ 5’ +S’ pier

Given the above deﬁnitions, the rate Equation (3) takes the following form:
v=e~ (61+th —a_kc_at). (4)

To account for proteomics data that reﬂect relative protein levels compared
to some reference state (rather than absolute protein concentrations),
Equation (4) can be rewritten as following:

e
_ + + — —
V—E(Cl vmaX—a vmax), (5)

where eref denotes the enzyme concentration in the reference state,
and vﬁﬁax and vfgax are equal to the corresponding enzyme turnover rates
multiplied by emf. Hence, in order to predict the metabolic ﬂux through a
certain enzyme given relative concentration level and saturation coefﬁcients
(computed given absolute metabolite levels and metabolite dissociation
constants), the corresponding vmaX value of the enzyme is also required.

We describe a new CBM method that addresses the problem of predicting
genome—scale metabolic ﬂux distributions, 17 , for a set of k growth conditions
(i=1, ...,k), given (Fig. l): (i) relative enzyme concentrations for a
core set of enzymes (denoted E), under the various conditions, /efef,
where (j: l, ...,k) and ieE; (ii) absolute substrate and product metabolite
concentrations for enzymes in E; (iii) metabolite dissociation constants.
Concentrations and dissociation constants together enable us to compute
enzyme saturation values, a? and a? where j: l, ...,k, and ieE. The
method is formulated as a QP problem that searches for k ﬂux distributions,
such that: (i) each ﬂux distribution satisﬁes stoichiometric mass—balance and
reaction directionality constraints, (ii) the ﬂuxes through the core reactions
(for which proteomic and metabolomic data is given) are as consistent as
possible with the estimated rates calculated via Equation (5). The latter is
facilitated by searching for the v$axai and vrgaxal. parameters for all enzymes
ieE as part of the QP optimization. IOMA’s QP problem is formulated as
following:

where Equation (6) represents mass—balance constraint for the k—th ﬂux
distributions, Equation (7) represents reaction directionality and ﬂux capacity
constraints, and Equation (8) represents the estimated ﬂuxes for the core
reactions based on the proteomic and metabolomic data. To account for
missing concentration levels of substrate and product metabolites for some
enzymes, the presence of noise in both the proteomic and metabolomic data,
and the simplifying assumptions employed in the rate equation formalism, the

Fig. 1. The ﬁgure illustrates the associations between variables in IOMA’s
optimization problem imposed by the various constraints. Rows represent
enzymes and columns represent growth conditions—Le. the j—th column
representing the ﬂux distribution for the j—th condition (denoted by W.
Mass—balance [Equation (6)] and reaction directionality [Equation (7)] create
dependencies between ﬂuxes through different enzymes in one condition,
irrespectiver of all others conditions (i.e. associating ﬂuxes in one column).
The enzyme—kinetic constraint [Equation (8)] associates between ﬂuxes
through one enzyme in different growth conditions (via the enzyme’s
parameters vfﬁax and vglax, which are condition—invariant), irrespectiver of
all other enzymes (i.e. associating ﬂuxes in one row). The latter constraint is
deﬁned only for a core set of enzymes for which metabolomic and proteomic
data is available (marked in blue). The union of both types of row and
column constraints in IOMA’s optimization indirectly associates between
many additional ﬂuxes through various enzymes in different conditions.

error  variables were added to Equation (8), guaranteeing a feasible solution
for the QP problem. The optimization is hence formulated to minimize the
total sum of variance in the error variables for each enzyme across the k
conditions. We chose to minimize the variance of the error variables (and
not their total sum) to account for potential metabolic regulation mechanisms
that are not explicitly incorporated in the model (e. g. allosteric regulation)
and may systematically affect the metabolic ﬂux.

The application of IOMA in this article considers additional constraints
by utilizing additional datasets given as input for each knockout condition:
ﬁrst, for a knockout condition j of an enzyme—coding gene that is not backed
up by isozymes in the model, the ﬂux through the corresponding reactions
was constrained to zero via the following constraint:

40:0, j=1,...,k.

Second, the organism’s growth rate (denoted vGR) in a knockout condition j
is given and is used to constrain the biomass yield rate:
VhiomaSSZVGR’ j: 1’ “"k'

Third, experimentally measured exchange ﬂuxes (uptake and secretion rates
for several metabolites) were further used to constrain the predicted ﬂux
distributions via a two—step procedure: (i) we applied QP for each condition
j (j = l, ...,k) in order to ﬁnd a feasible steady—state ﬂux distribution 17 for
which the Euclidean distance to the given exchange ﬂuxes is minimized;
(ii) we added the following constraints to IOMA’s optimization problem, so
that the exchange ﬂuxes are ﬁxed at the values predicted in (i):

véx=téx, j: 1, .... ..k.
The commercial CPLEX solver was used for solving QP problems, on 64—bit
machines running Linux.

relies on random sampling of possible wild—type ﬂux distributions to predict
knockout effects. (b) Exchange ﬂuxes are given as input to both methods,
and are used by MOMA to obtain a more reliable prediction of the wild—type
ﬂux distribution. In both test scenarios, IOMA’s predictions are signiﬁcantly
more accurate.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Predicting gene knockout effects in the red blood
cell model

As a ﬁrst validation of IOMA, we applied it to predict metabolic
ﬂuxes in human erythrocytes. For this metabolic system, a detailed
kinetic model (Jamshidi, 2001) is readily available for validation,
by simulating the steady—state metabolic ﬂux after gene knockouts.
This model consists of four basic pathways: glycolysis, pentose—
phosphate pathway (PPP), adenosine nucleotide metabolism, and
the Rapoport—Leubering shunt, accounting for 48 metabolites, 39
internal reactions and nine exchange reactions. The set of differential
equations in the model, describing the dynamics of metabolite
concentration, were solved via the ‘ode15s’ solver in Matlab (The
Mathworks, Inc.). To generate synthetic proteomic and metaoblomic
data that can be used as input to IOMA, and the corresponding
ﬂux data for validation, we utilized the RBC kinetic model in the
following way: a gene knockout was modeled by restricting the
ﬂux through its corresponding reaction to zero. Random protein
levels were drawn from a uniform distribution, reﬂecting up to
5—fold increase or decrease in concentration compared to the wild—
type condition. These protein levels were then used to determine the
values in the kinetic model.

To apply IOMA to predict metabolic ﬂuxes for all gene knockouts
given a CBM model of RBC metabolism, we provide it with the
randomly generated proteomic data and the corresponding steady—
state metabolomic data (identiﬁed by the RBC kinetic model) for a
core set of 10 reactions whose rate equations (in the kinetic model)
are based on Michaelis Menten—like kinetics. The performance
of IOMA is evaluated in terms of predicting signiﬁcant changes
in ﬂux between the wild—type strain and each of the knockouts,
considering a threshold of 0.001 to deﬁne a signiﬁcant increase
or decrease in ﬂux. Repeating the analysis 50 times with random
proteomic data provided an average precision of 0.95, recall of
0.93, and an overall accuracy of 0.91 (where accuracy is the
rate of true predictions) (Fig. 2a). Similar results were obtained
assuming a normal distribution for protein levels with an average
precision of 0.96, recall of 0.94, and an overall accuracy of 0.92.

IOMA’s prediction accuracy is insensitive to the speciﬁc choice of
threshold, with thresholds in the range 0.0001—0.l yielding <2.5%
change in the prediction accuracy. Notably, applying other ﬂux
prediction methods such as FBA and MOMA in this setup, given
only metabolomic and proteomic data is problematic: FBA depends
on a deﬁnition of a cellular objective function (commonly assumed
to be the maximization of biomass yield rate in microbes), which is
not available in the RBC model. MOMA depends on data regarding
the wild—type ﬂux distribution, which in this test scenario was not
given as input. Utilizing a sampling technique (Becker et al., 2007)
to predict a set of 100 feasible ﬂux distributions for the wild—type
strain and applying MOMA to predict the knockout effects starting
from each of them resulted in a markedly lower average accuracy
of 0.45 (Fig. 2a).

To enable further comparison with MOMA, we considered a
second test scenario in which the ﬂuxes through exchange reactions
(representing the uptake and secretion of metabolites from the
growth environment; which are easier to measure experimentally) as
identiﬁed by the kinetic model, are also given as input to IOMA and
MOMA. The ﬂux distribution of the wild—type strain is computed via
QP, by searching for a feasible ﬂux vector, satisfying mass—balance
and reaction directionality constraints, minimizing the Euclidian
distance between the predicted exchange ﬂuxes and those given
as input. MOMA was applied starting from this predicted wild—
type ﬂux distribution, utilizing also the given ﬂux rates through
the exchange reactions for all knockout conditions (via additional
constraints in MOMA’s QP formulation). The additional ﬂux data
through exchange reactions is also utilized in a similar manner
by IOMA as described in the ‘Methods’ section. The results show
that while MOMA’s performance signiﬁcantly improves in this test
scenario, reaching an average accuracy of 0.82, IOMA still achieves
a statistically signiﬁcant higher accuracy of 0.91 (Fig. 2b) (Wilcoxon
P—value= 1.61 x 10—5).

To test the robustness of IOMA to noise in the proteomic and
metabolomic data, we repeated the ﬁrst test scenario (the more
challenging one, without using metabolite uptake and secretion rates
as input), while adding random noise to both data sources given as
input to IOMA. The noise was drawn from a normal distribution with
mean zero and SD = 10—50% of the true proteomic and metabolomic
levels (as obtained from the kinetic simulations). The results show
that IOMA still achieves a high accuracy of 0.95 and 0.84, for SD
levels of 10—50%, respectively, testifying for IOMA’s robustness to
noisy measurements.

3.2 Predicting metabolic ﬂuxes in E.coli via the
integration of experimental metabolomic and
proteomic data

As a second validation of IOMA, we applied it to the genome—scale
E.coli metabolic network model of Feist et al. (2007) accounting
for 1260 metabolic genes, 2382 reactions and 1668 metabolites, to
predict metabolic ﬂux distributions for wild—type E.coli K—12 and
23 single—gene knockouts, which cover most viable glycolysis and
PPPs knockouts, grown in glucose minimal medium. As input we
utilized experimentally measured absolute protein (mg—protein/g—
dry cell weight) and metabolite (mM) concentrations for a core set
of 11 reactions, uptake and secretion rates for nine metabolites,
and measured growth rates, all taken from the E.coli multi—omics
database (Ishii, 2007). Metabolites’ dissociation constants (km) were

obtained from the BRENDA database (Bennett et al., 2009). To
validate the predicted ﬂux distributions, we utilized experimentally
measured ﬂuxes in these knockout strains for 26 reactions in E. coli ’s
central metabolism, also taken from the multi—omics database.

To assess the accuracy of IOMA versus that of MOMA and
FBA, we compared their predictions of signiﬁcant increase or
decrease in ﬂux for the 26 measured reactions between the wild—
type and knockout strains (considering the same threshold of 0.001
to deﬁne signiﬁcant changes in ﬂux as done above). As shown in
Figure 3, IOMA achieves a prediction accuracy of 0.54 which is
markedly higher than that achieved by FBA and MOMA (0.44 and
0.38, respectively). The prediction accuracy is signiﬁcantly high
compared to random predictions, with a hypergeometric P—value
of 1.26 X 10—4 and 5.12 X 10—8 for the prediction of increased
and decreased ﬂuxes compared to the wild—type strain, respectively.
Notably, IOMA’s prediction accuracy is insensitive to the speciﬁc
choice of threshold (with thresholds in the range of 0.0001—0.l
yielding <5% change in the prediction accuracy of the various
methods).

An example ﬂux distribution predicted by IOMA following the
knockout of an enzyme in the non—oxidative branch of the PPP,
talB (Transaldolase B), is shown in Figure 4. The ﬁgure shows that
IOMA correctly predicts an increase in ﬂux through most of the
enzymes in glycolysis and a decreased ﬂux through enzymes in
PPP following the knockout of talB. FBA is only partially correct,
predicting an increased ﬂux through both glycolysis and PPP, while
MOMA falsely predicts both the increased glycolysis and decreased
PPP ﬂuxes.

To demonstrate the added value of utilizing both proteomics
and metabolomics to infer metabolic ﬂux, we compared IOMA’s
performance when given both proteomics and metabolomics, to
its performance when only one of the sources is given as input.
To utilize IOMA only with proteomic data, we considered zero
saturation coefﬁcients (aJr and a_) for all enzymes, while for
utilizing it only with metabolomic data, we considered a constant
expression level for each enzyme across the various conditions
(e/eref = 1). We ﬁnd that, quite expectedly, when only a single data

when using both data sources together, with the prediction accuracy
obtained when using only proteomic or metabolomic down to 0.45
and 0.42, respectively. Notably, using either data source alone still
improves the prediction accuracy upon FBA and MOMA. Gene
expression is signiﬁcantly easier to measure than proteomics and was
previously shown to signiﬁcantly correlate with protein levels (Lee
et al., 2000; Tuller et al., 2007). Here, we ﬁnd an average correlation
of 0.65 (with 19 knockouts yielding a signiﬁcant P—value <0.05)
between measured gene and protein expression levels across all gene
knockouts in the employed dataset (Ishii, 2007). Considering this
high correlation, we further explored the predictive performance of
IOMA’s given gene expression data instead of proteomic data. The
analysis shows that IOMA obtains an accuracy of 0.49 when utilizing
gene expression and metabolomics with a hypergeometric P—value
of 3.15 X 10—4 and 8.63 X 10—8 for the prediction of increased
and decreased ﬂuxes compared to the wild—type strain, respectively

(higher than the accuracy obtained with FBA and MOMA as reported
above).

4 DISCUSSION

This study presents a novel approach for integrating quantitative
proteomic and metabolomic data with a genome—scale metabolic
network model to predict ﬂux alterations under different
perturbations, based on a mechanistic model for determining
reaction rate. The method predicts feasible ﬂux distributions while
accounting for missing concentration levels of substrate and product
metabolites for some enzymes, for potential noise in both the
proteomic and metabolomic data, and for the simplifying rate
equation formalism used. IOMA is shown to successfully predict
changes in ﬂuxes both in E. coli ’s central metabolism under various
genetic perturbations and in a simulated RBC kinetic model,
displaying a signiﬁcant improvement versus the commonly used
FBA and MOMA methods.

Metabolic ﬂuxes are the most informative and direct indices of
the metabolic and physiological state of cells/tissues, and hence,
inferring their state in different biological contexts is probably the
holy grail of metabolic modeling. However, in a somewhat spiteful
way, while we are facing an ever increasing availability of numerous
pertaining high—throughput ‘omics’ data including transcriptomic,
proteomic and metabolomic measurements, the measurement of
ﬂuxes is still very challenging and limited to a small fraction
of the reactions present in cells. Hence, there is an emerging
need to continue and develop new computational methods for
robustly inferring the ﬂux state, while capitalizing on these other
available ‘omics’ measurements. In this context, IOMA presents
an important step forward in this direction, which hopefully will
be followed upon by others. IOMA proﬁts from the absolute
quantiﬁcation of metabolites levels (in contrast to fold changes), that
are becoming available, while absolute quantiﬁcation of proteins is
not necessary. Apart from the speciﬁc kind of reaction rate laws
utilized in this work, IOMA can be used with a variety of rate laws
including different types of regulation or enzyme saturation. The
only restriction is that the rate laws can be represented in the form
of Equation (5), where estimates of the terms aJr and a_ can be
recomputed based on available data. Future work for improving
ﬂux predictions, could possibly utilize existing information on
the thermodynamic constants of reactions to further constraint the
model’s solution space, following Henry et al. (2007).

Another potential application of IOMA is the prediction
of metabolic ﬂux alterations associated with human metabolic
disorders (as means for predicting potential clinical biomarkers).
Encouragingly, genome— scale human metabolic models have already
shown their value in this highly important clinical task [e. g. in the
case of inborn errors of metabolism (Shlomi and Cabili, 2009)],
but as the methods used up until now have been simple and
straightforward, there is certainly much room for improvement
ahead, to which methods like IOMA are bound to serve as solid
starting points.

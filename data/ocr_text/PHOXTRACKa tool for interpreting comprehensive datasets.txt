ABSTRACT

Summary: We introduce PHOXTRACK (PHOsphosite-X-TRacing
Analysis of Causal Kinases), a user-friendly freely available software
tool for analyzing large datasets of post-translational modifications of
proteins, such as phosphorylation, which are commonly gained by
mass spectrometry detection. In contrast to other currently applied
data analysis approaches, PHOXT RACK uses full sets of quantitative
proteomics data and applies non-parametric statistics to calculate
whether defined kinase-specific sets of phosphosite sequences indi-
cate statistically significant concordant differences between various
biological conditions. PHOXT RACK is an efficient tool for extracting
post-translational information of comprehensive proteomics datasets
to decipher key regulatory proteins and to infer biologically relevant
molecular pathways.

Availability: PHOXT RACK will be maintained over the next years and
is freely available as an online tool for non-commercial use at http://
phoxtrack.molgen.mpg.de. Users will also find a tutorial at this Web
site and can additionally give feedback at https://groups.google.com/
d/forum/phoxtrack-discuss.

Comprehensive analysis of the entire set of kinases and other
enzymes inducing post-translational protein modiﬁcation assists
in providing a holistic View of cellular states, and supports in
generating unbiased hypotheses for experimental testing. In par-
ticular, phosphorylation of proteins plays a pivotal role in the
regulation of many cellular signaling and disease processes. Mass
spectrometry technologies allow for comprehensive quantiﬁca-
tion of the proteome (Sauer et al., 2005), including the detection
of several 10000 phosphosite sequences of cellular proteins.
However, the current standard data analysis strategies applied
for the discovery of important regulatory kinases, such as
sequence motif analyses, are insufﬁcient for gaining speciﬁc in-
sights (Olsen and Mann, 2013). Moreover, these conventional
approaches suffer from severe inefﬁciencies, as they make
use of only a minor fraction of the information contained in
large-scale phosphoproteome datasets (see Supplementary
Background Information and results in Supplementary Figs

S1—S4). A major limitation of all current phosphoproteomic
data analyses consists in the need of setting a threshold for
determining signiﬁcantly hyper- and hypophosphorylated phos-
phosite (increased or decreased phosphorylation of a particular
amino acid relative to the control experiment). This generally
restricts the analyses on only few strongly regulated phosphosite
sequence sites and completely ignores the information of the
major part of the many thousands of phosphopeptides detected
in biological samples (Supplementary Fig. S5).

PHOXTRACK (PHOsphosite—X-TRacing Analysis of Causal
Kinases) largely overcomes these current limitations of phospho-
site sequence data analysis. Notably, PHOXTRACK considers
the full set of phosphosite sequences detected by mass spectrom-
etry, resulting in powerful and largely unbiased enrichment
of regulated kinases. PHOXTRACK further applies non-paramet-
ric Kolmogorov—Smirnov enrichment statistics (Meierhofer et al.,
2013; Subramanian et al., 2005) to calculate whether deﬁned
kinase-speciﬁc sets of phosphosites indicate statistically signiﬁcant
concordant differences between various biological samples under
investigation (Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. S6 and Tutorial).

We initially deﬁned experimentally validated kinase-speciﬁc
phosphosite sets using data from the public databases
PhosphoSitePlus (Hornbeck et al., 2012), Swiss-Prot, the
Human Protein Reference Database (Keshava Prasad et al.,
2009) and Phospho.ELM (Dinkel et al., 2011), containing
thousands of substrate sequence/kinase interactions derived
from thousands of human and murine studies (Fig. l and
Supplementary Table S1). Notably, the user can extend the list
of kinase-speciﬁc phosphosite sets by using alternative databases
including disease- and treatment-associated information.

We then used the prior deﬁned sets of kinase-speciﬁc phos-
phosites and computed an enrichment score that reﬂects the
degree to which the set of kinase-speciﬁc phosphosites is over-
represented at the top or bottom of a ranked list of detected
phosphorylation ratios (Fig. 1). As shown in Supplementary
Figs S7—S10, we successfully benchmarked the results obtained
by PHOXTRACK using biological data from technically diverse
proteomics studies focusing on cell cycle analysis, chemothera-
peutic treatment of embryonic stem cells, and phosphoproﬁling
of human breast cancer tissues of high- versus low-risk recur-
rence groups. In all these studies, conventional phosphosite data
analysis only roughly hinted to rather broadly deﬁned kinase
groups. Notably, PHOXTRACK indicated speciﬁcally causal
kinases, which could be conﬁrmed by additional experiments
including, for example, kinase/kinase substrate immunoblotting,
leading to fruitful network analyses and biological interpretation
(Supplementary Results).

Fig. 1. Principle of PHOXTRACK. (Left) Thousands of experimentally
veriﬁed sequence-speciﬁc kinase/substrate data were extracted from
public databases. The 13-mer sequence window around the phosphory-
lated site of the peptide (:l:6) is used as identiﬁer tag. In the current
version PHOXTRACK contains 7560 human and 3177 murine unique
phosphosite tags with kinase information, distributed to 1241 human and
651 murine kinase/substrate sets with up to 500 substrate phosphosites
per kinase. (Right) Large-scale phosphoproteome data commonly con-
tain several thousands of identiﬁed phosphosites of protein sequences
that were relatively quantiﬁed between two conditions (e.g. treated
versus non-treated samples). The user can submit a list of sequence
tags (:l:6) assigned to measured peptide ratios (logarithmized). (Bottom)
PHOXTRACK then compares the user list with the phosphosite set data-
bases and computes an enrichment score, which reﬂects the degree to
which the kinase-speciﬁc set of phosphosites is overrepresented at the
top (red) or bottom (blue) of the ranked phosphosite list submitted by
the user. PHOXTRACK thus predicts activation or inhibition of kinase
activity

Additional sensitivity will be achieved by steadily increasing
the quantity and quality of experimental data of phosphosite
sequences and of public databases containing information on
experimentally validated substrates of kinases. Currently,
PHOXTRACK makes use of comprehensive assembled se-
quence-speciﬁc kinase substrate data derived from human and
mouse samples (Supplementary Fig. Sll). But the
PHOXTRACK tool also enables the user to upload similar data-
bases for other organisms.

Furthermore, extension of the PHOXTRACK tool for further
post-translational modiﬁcations will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt from
community efforts to add experimentally validated protein modi-
ﬁcation data (for example acetylation, methylation or ubiquiti-
nation data) to maintained publically available databases. By
loading these data, PHOXTRACK can in principle be extended
for inferring the biological roles of a large variety of post-trans-
lational modiﬁcations in complex datasets.

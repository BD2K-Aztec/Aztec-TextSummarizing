ABSTRACT

Motivation: Quantitative determination of metabolic fluxes in single
tissue biopsies is difficult. We report a novel analysis approach and
software package for in vivo flux quantification using stable isotope
labeling.

Results: We developed a protocol based on brief, timed infusion
of 130 isotope-enriched substrates for the tricarboxylic acid
(TCA) cycle followed by quick freezing of tissue biopsies. NMR
measurements of tissue extracts were used for flux estimation based
on a computational model of carbon transitions between TCA cycle
metabolites and related amino acids. To this end, we developed
a computational framework in which metabolic systems can be
flexibly assembled, simulated and analyzed. Flux parameters were
quantified from NMR multiplets by a partial grid search followed by
repeated Nelder—Mead optimizations implemented on a computer
grid. We implemented a model of the TCA cycle and showed
by extensive simulations that the timed infusion protocol reliably
quantitates multiple fluxes. Experimental validation of the method
was done in Vivo on hearts of anesthetized pigs under two different
conditions: basal state (n =7) and cardiac stress caused by infusion
of dobutamine (n27). About nine tissue samples (40—200 mg dry-
weight) were taken per heart. TCA cycle flux was 6.11 i028 (SEM)
umol/mingdw at baseline versus 9.29i1.03 umol/mingdw for
dobutamine stress. Oxygen consumption calculated from the TCA
cycle flux and from ‘gold standard’ blood gas-based measurements
were close, correlating with r 20.88 (P < 10—4). Spatial heterogeneity
in metabolic fluxes is detectable amongst the small samples. We
propose that our novel isotope snapshot methodology is suitable for
flux measurements in biopsies in vivo.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic ﬂuxes reﬂect the function and dynamics of cells in
the body. However, measuring metabolic ﬂuxes in small tissue
samples in animals in vivo is very difﬁcult and needs (i) a special
experimental strategy and (ii) sophisticated computational analysis.
Measurement of metabolic ﬂuxes in whole organs or large tissue

volumes was possible by measuring time series of 13C incorporation
in intermediary metabolites with in vivo NMR spectroscopy (Chance
et al., 1983; Malloy et al., 1990). van Beek et al. (1998, 1999)
developed a strategy to infuse substrates enriched with stable
isotopes for several minutes and arrest metabolism before a steady
state of label incorporation is attained. Metabolic ﬂuxes are then
quantitated by computational analysis from NMR measurements on
a single tissue sample collected at a single time point. Given the
usually quite heterogeneous metabolism of tissue, this approach
overcomes the difﬁculty that a time series of metabolite levels
cannot be obtained from one small biopsy in tissue. However, an
advanced computational analysis is key to successfully perform
these metabolic ﬂux measurements in vivo and is presented here.

It was desirable to optimize the original computational analysis
strategy and software to quantitate ﬂuxes from biopsies. This
analysis was originally built on a package optimized for indicator—
dilution studies in a PET setting (van Beek et al., 1999). The
underlying models were built on early pre—steady—state labeling
work (Chance et al., 1983; Malloy et al., 1990; van Beek
et al., 1998, 1999). Meanwhile, further non—steady—state approaches
have been developed with applications in biotechnology (N6h
and Wiechert, 2006). Here, we present a new analysis approach
optimized for the single time point analysis applicable to biopsies.
This approach is embedded in a software package that makes it
possible to build carbon transition models for arbitrary metabolic
pathways without the need to apply a computer programming
language.

Metabolic ﬂuxes can be measured by infusion of substrates
labeled with radioactive or stable isotopes. Usually the time course
of incorporation of label is followed, for instance, by in vivo NMR
spectroscopy, or label is infused sufﬁciently long that a stable steady
state is reached. In the latter case relative ﬂuxes can be determined,
and if uptake from outside the cells can be measured, absolute ﬂuxes
can be derived. Under in vitro conditions, uptake of a substrate
can often easily be measured. For instance, the decrease of glucose
in cell culture medium gives its uptake in the cells. However, it
is difﬁcult to measure uptake of substrate in small regions in the
body from the blood. This would require measurement of metabolite

levels in the venous blood, which is feasible for whole organs
but difﬁcult for small regions due to the small size and dense
interconnection of venules and veins. On the other hand, the spatial
and biochemical resolution of non—invasive spectroscopic imaging
techniques is insufﬁcient.

Most existing methods and software [e.g. OpenFLUX (Quek
et al., 2009)] developed for ﬂux estimation require the close
approximation of a steady state of isotope label incorporation
(Antoniewicz et al., 2007; Kelleher, 2001; Sherry et al., 2004;
Wiechert, 2001). This leads to long experiments requiring a large
amount of isotope—enriched substrate and is particularly challenging
in mammalian experiments, where metabolic steady states are often
brief. To solve these problems, methods for quick ﬂux quantiﬁcation
have been designed (van Beek et al., 1998, 1999). In contrast with
previously developed methods, metabolism is arrested before an
isotopic steady state is reached and samples are taken. This generates
a snapshot of labeling at one time point. The extent of isotope
incorporation in carefully chosen key metabolites in the sample is
measured. Hence, using this experimental strategy, which we term
Labeling with Isotope for Pre—Steady—State Snapshots (LIPSSS),
only a single time point measurement is needed to quantify multiple
metabolic ﬂuxes.

The LIPSSS method was previously validated in isolated
hearts (van Beek et al., 1998, 1999). However, an enhanced
computational analysis able to analyze LIPSSS data including a
validation of this new ﬂux analysis approach in vivo is highly
desirable. To this end, a ﬂexible and improved simulation and
analysis algorithm is implemented in a software package named
FluxEs, described here. The software package allows assembling
the model equations for arbitrary metabolic systems using a simple
input format. This avoids extensive computer programming to hard
code the metabolic pathways and experimental protocols. Hence,
FluxEs facilitates a ﬂexible application to a broad range of metabolic
systems and enables life scientists without computer programming
skills to simulate and analyze stable isotope experiments.

Parameter estimation in large metabolic systems is a great chal—
lenge, particularly because a certain fraction of the model parameters
typically shows low sensitivity and ‘sloppiness’ (Gutenkunst et al.,
2007). The latter term means among others that the predicted
results are insensitive to certain parameter combinations, but very
sensitive to correlated changes in other parameter combinations. In
particular, parameters in these models often exhibit least squares cost
landscapes, which show ‘golf course’ characteristics with shallow
slopes and multiple narrow minima (Brown and Sethna, 2003).
Hence, we describe a new parameter optimization strategy suitable
to handle such metabolic systems, implemented in FluxEs. The
strategy that additionally includes suitable error estimation of the
quantiﬁed ﬂuxes and possible incorporation of prior knowledge via
Bayesian priors was developed by extensive computer simulations.

To validate the new analysis approach, we analyzed LIPSSS
data obtained from experiments on mammalian hearts in vivo
under two metabolic conditions: seven hearts studied under
baseline conditions, which had been analyzed before with the old
algorithms (Alders et al., 2004) and seven new hearts studied
under dobutamine stress to increase metabolism. To experimentally
validate the new analysis algorithms for the LIPSSS method in
FluxEs, the results were compared with a ‘gold standard’ method
to quantify aerobic metabolism in whole hearts using blood oxygen
measurements.

The FluxEs package runs in the R environment which is open
source. R is available on different computing platforms (MS
Windows, Linux, Macintosh, etc.), and is widely used for statistical
data analysis, for instance of microarray gene expression data.

In summary, we describe a new method for ﬂux quantiﬁcation
based on LIPSSS experiments. We present a computer package
(FluxEs) to easily implement computer models for arbitrary
metabolic pathways and quantify ﬂuxes by estimating model
parameters. Compared with our earlier pre—steady—state analysis
approach (Alders et al., 2004; van Beek et al., 1998, 1999), the
method described in this article includes a tailored approach to
parameter optimization necessary for ﬂux estimation, including
error analysis and use of prior knowledge. It was developed
and its properties were assessed based on a large number of
computer simulations. Finally, we validate the overall approach
experimentally on tissue samples taken during in vivo experiments
on porcine hearts.

2 METHODS
2.1 LIPSSS method and tricarboxylic acid cycle model

The investigation of biological systems using LIPSSS experiments involves
a timed, brief infusion of a substrate enriched with isotopic labels into
the metabolic system (van Beek et al., 1998, 1999). For instance, 13C
may be enriched in glucose or acetate, replacing the highly natural
abundant 12C. Metabolism in the sample is stopped at a predeﬁned time
before an isotopic steady state is reached. The isotope labels are distributed
by biochemical reactions and cause different combinations of isotopes,
termed isotopomers, in particular metabolite pools. For instance, two carbon
metabolites such as acetate or acetyl coenzyme A may consist of four
isotopomers: 12C12C, 12C13C, 13C12C and 13C13C.

Depending on the metabolic ﬂuxes all metabolite pools have a
characteristic composition of isotopomer fractions at each time point of the
dynamic phase before reaching isotopic steady state. Consequently, ﬂuxes
can be determined from measurements reﬂecting isotopomer fractions (van
Beek et al., 1998, 1999). Unfortunately, only relative ﬂux contributions can
be quantiﬁed if an isotopic steady state has been reached. However, before
isotopic equilibrium the isotope enrichment measurements yields sufﬁcient
information to quantify absolute ﬂux values. Single isotopomer fractions or
cumulated contributions of several different isotopomers are reﬂected by
distinct line intensities in single time point measurements done with NMR
spectroscopy or mass spectrometry (MS). The line intensities predicted by
model analysis depend on the metabolic ﬂuxes, and reversely, measured line
intensities allow quantifying ﬂuxes in the biological system (Section 2.3).
The model applied in this study (Fig. 1) was modiﬁed from a model of the
TCA cycle described previously (van Beek et al., 1998, 1999). Although any
metabolic pathway is easily implemented using the new computer package
(Supplementary Material), this TCA cycle model was chosen to demonstrate
the computer package because it applies to the validation experiments (see
below). The model consists of 10 metabolite pools: eight pools with a ﬁnite
metabolite content and two implemented as ‘virtual’ pools with negligible
amounts of metabolites. Such virtual pools were previously introduced
in mathematical models for isolated heart NMR experiments by Malloy
et al. (1990). They are implemented with algebraic equations rather than
differential equations and mix converging metabolic ﬂuxes without any
time delay. This approximates mixing of several metabolic ﬂuxes in small
metabolite pools exhibiting fast turnover rates.

Carbon is transferred between metabolites, from one speciﬁc atomic
position in one pool to another speciﬁc position in the next pool. In the TCA
cycle model, 50 such carbon transitions link the metabolites. The model has
been validated with in vivo NMR spectroscopy time course data (van Beek
et 61]., 1999).

Fig. 1. The carbon transition network of the TCA cycle consists of 10
metabolic pools: (1) acetate, (2) diluting pool that accounts for admixture of
other substrates forming acetyl coenzyme A (acCoA) such as carbohydrates
and fatty acids, (3) acCoA, (4) citrate (also representing cis—aconitate and
isocitrate), (5) oz—ketoglutarate, (6) glutamate, (7) anaplerotic pool, (8)
succinate, (9) oxaloacetate (also representing fumarate and malate) and (10)
aspartate. acCoA and succinate are implemented as ‘virtual’ pools (VP, see
text). Each circle represents a carbon atom and each string of circles a
molecule. The numbers in the circles give the numbering of the carbon atoms
according to standard nomenclature. Fluxes entering the system are presented
as dotted arrows, while ﬂuxes leaving the system are illustrated as dashed—
dotted arrows. The two exchange ﬂuxes between TCA cycle intermediates
and amino acids are indicated by dashed arrows. TCA cycle ﬂux is given by
continuous arrows. Half of the ﬂux between oz—ketoglutarate and succinate
is going via one branch (black arrows), the other half is going via the other
branch (gray arrows), reversing the carbon chain in the symmetric metabolite.
For parameter descriptions see text.

The model contains ﬁve parameters. Jtca (umol / min ' gdw) is the absolute
TCA cycle ﬂux and considered to be constant over the entire TCA cycle. Jexc
(umol/min gdw) is an exchange ﬂux swapping (i) oz—ketoglutarate carbon
skeleton with glutamate and (ii) aspartate’s skeleton with oxaloacetate back
and forth by transamination. The fractional parameter Pdi] accounts for the
relative dilution of the ﬂux from labeled acetate into the acetyl coenzyme A
pool by unlabeled substrates such as glucose, glycogen, fatty acids, etc., and
reﬂects relative carbon substrate ﬂuxes. The fractional anaplerotic ﬂux Panap
accounts for the relative anaplerotic dilution of the TCA cycle ﬂux with
metabolites, which remain unlabeled at early time points, during infusion of
enriched substrate (Sherry et al., 2004). Since pyruvate carboxylase activity,
which underlies anaplerosis into the oxaloacetate pool, is less important
in heart tissue, we did not incorporate additional anaplerotic ﬂux into the
oxaloacetate pool (Pound et al., 2009). Finall3y, the time constant T trans (min)
describes the exponential accumulation of 1 C label in acetyl coenzyme A
from infused 13C—acetate (Randle et 61]., 1970; van Beek 62‘ 611., 1999). The
myocardial oxygen consumption MVO2 ( umol / min ' gdw) linked to oxidative
phosphorylation is calculated from two of the parameters (Chatham et al.,
1995):

Mvoz = (2+PdiI)Jtea (1)

2.2 Experimental data

LIPSSS experiments were done on two groups of pigs studied under
anesthesia: basal state [n = 7, control group, previously analyzed with the old

algorithms in Alders et al. (2004)] and cardiac stress caused by dobutamine
infusion (n27, dobutamine group). Additionally, for each heart oxygen
consumption was calculated from blood gas and blood ﬂow measurements.
All experiments were performed according to the following protocol: after
the pigs were anesthetized, a continuous infusion of unlabeled acetate into
the left descending coronary artery was initiated to establish a metabolic
baseline within 6 min (Randle et 01., 1970). Dobutamine (10—1511. g / minekg)
was given via peripheral venous infusion in the second group. After 30 min
the infusion of unlabeled acetate was instantly replaced by an equally
concentrated [2—13C] acetate infusion for 4 min. Finally, a second switch was
made to [1,2—13C] acetate for an additional 90 s. For a detailed description
we refer to Alders et al. (2004)

The oxygen content of venous blood coming from the whole left ventricle
was measured in blood samples from the coronary sinus with a blood
gas analyzer. Local blood ﬂow was measured using radioactively labeled
microspheres in the same tissue regions as used for 13C NMR spectroscopy.
The blood gas and blood ﬂow measurements were then used to calculate
the oxygen consumption within the heart. An ~4 cm2 large area of the
anterior left ventricular free wall of the cardiac tissue was excised, ﬂash—
frozen, freeze—dried and subdivided into smaller parts. The subdivision led
to about nine tissue biopsies for each heart (40—200 mg dry weight). Finally,
metabolites were extracted from these biopsies using perchloric acid and
glutamate’s 13C NMR multiplets measured (Alders et al., 2004). Up to nine
independent multiplets were obtained and analyzed by the FluxEs program
to estimate the parameters of the TCA cycle model (Section 2.3).

2.3 Computer package and ﬂux parameter
optimization

Knowledge of metabolic ﬂux parameters is crucial to understand metabolism.
Therefore, we developed a computer package, named FluxEs, which applies
new analysis algorithms (see below) for the estimation of metabolic
parameters using information of isotopomer distributions. FluxEs is based on
our previously developed program FluxSimulator (Binsl et al., 2007), which
allowed simulation of isotopomer distributions but did not include parameter
estimation. FluxEs is running in the R computational environment and is
compatible with all operating systems on which R is implemented. Hence,
it was easy to port FluxEs from a desktop to the Dutch Life Science Grid
where all computations were performed. FluxEs accepts an easy input format
that offers non—computer scientists a convenient and ﬂexible way to specify
arbitrary metabolic models in a plain text ﬁle (Supplementary Material).
Using the information about the metabolic pathway and its carbon transitions,
the ordinary differential equations (ODEs) representing the mathematical
model are automatically assembled and the user is guided through the
optimization setup via command—line inputs. A description of the systems
of differential equations representing such models is given in Binsl et al.
(2007) and for the TCA cycle model example in van Beek et al. (1999).

By solving the ODEs via numerical integration [ODE solver
by Hindmarsh ( 1983)], isotopomer fractions evolving over time are
calculated for each metabolite pool of the model. The pool concentrations
were taken from Alders et al. (2004) and van Beek et al. (1999). During
parameter estimation the integration routine continuously calculates these
isotopomer fractions using different parameter estimates provided by the
optimization algorithm. An example of dynamically evolving isotopomer
fractions is given in Figure Sl (Supplementary Material). The isotopomer
fractions, determined for the time point at which the sample is taken in
the experiment, are then used to calculate simulated 13C NMR multiplet
intensities msim. These simulated NMR multiplet intensities are compared
with the experimental NMR multiplets mexp (van Beek et 01., 1999) and
weighted by the standard deviation (SD) 0 of the multiplet measurement
value for that time point (X2 scoring function). The SDs of the intensities
are derived from the NMR—free induction decay signal by the analysis
package AMARES (Vanhamme et al., 1997). A Bayesian prior with previous
knowledge about a parameter can be added to the cost function. In this term
13 is the expected value of the parameter, p the current value of the parameter

2.4 Parameter exploration and simulation

Initially, the ﬂux estimation procedure was extensively tested on synthetic
noisy data to ﬁnd an optimal strategy to estimate the parameters of the TCA
cycle model. Eight relevant metabolic states to be simulated were deﬁned
based on the experimental data: the samples of the control group (n = 63)
and the dobutamine group (n = 56) were hierarchically clustered (complete
linkage) according to their NMR multiplet intensities. We discovered four
clusters in the control (CLgon, CLEOH, CLgon, CLgon) and four clusters in the
dobutamine group (CLcllob, CLﬁob, CLE’lob, CLﬁob). Clusters within and among
the groups differed in the number of detectable multiplets and multiplet
intensities. To generate eight synthetic datasets corresponding to the clusters
the following steps were performed.

The sample closest to the average of the cluster’s samples was chosen as
representative. Then the experimental protocol introduced in Section 2.2 was
simulated with parameter values for Jtca, Jexc, T trans, Pdil and Panap giving
synthetic NMR multiplets close to the representative sample. According to
prior knowledge found in the literature (Martini et al., 2002; Panchal et al.,
2000, 2001), the relative anaplerosis of the TCA cycle ﬂux Panap was set to
6% of the TCA cycle ﬂux during the simulations.

In order to put realistic noise on the synthetic multiplets, we averaged the
standard errors of the NMR measurements for each multiplet in the cluster.
This error was added as Gaussian noise to the particular simulated multiplet.
For instance, the average relative standard error of all singlets of the third
carbon atom of glutamate (S3) in cluster CL;0n was 11.1%. Hence, 11.1%
Gaussian noise was added to the simulated S3 value. Finally, for all multiplets
it was checked whether intensities had become lower with the added noise
than the minimum intensity measurable for that multiplet in the cluster. Such
multiplets were considered not detectable and removed from the simulated
data. Following this procedure 25 noisy datasets were generated for each
cluster.

xgﬁm cost surfaces were visualized using 2D contour plots with pairs
of parameters as variables while keeping the remaining parameters ﬁxed.
The composition of the surface is deﬁned by the xgrim between multiplets
simulated with reference parameter values and multiplets computed for
parameter values deviating from the reference. Example contour plots are
shown in Figure 2 and discussed in Section 3. Using the contour plots
the parameter space was explored to discover (i) parameter sensitivities to
variations of other parameters and (ii) parameter combinations that give
little variation in model prediction. The latter are termed ‘sloppy’ directions
in parameter space (Gutenkunst et al., 2007).

2.5 Parameter optimization

The simulation studies demonstrated that parameter estimation in shallow
parameter landscapes using random start values is a challenge. To
improve this situation, a new strategy was developed to guide the
optimization to the global optimum. First, the parameter space of
dimension n25 parameters was covered by a grid. The grid points
were all combinations of: Jtca = (1,2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64) umol/minegdw, JeXC =
(1,2,4,8,16,32,64) umol/mingdw, Ttrans=(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9) min,
Panap=(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9) and Pdﬂ:(0.1,0.3,0.5,0.7,0.9). Afterwards,
for every grid point its xgﬁm value was calculated and the 10 grid points

with the lowest xzﬁor value were used as starting points for the subsequent
parameter estimation. To avoid missing those regions which are on average
low but without a particularly low grid point on a corner, the parameter
space was covered with n—dimensional polyhedrons using the grid points as
vertex points. To quantitate the average level of a polyhedron’s part of the

parameter combinations, plotted around the region of the global minimum.
Parameters Jtca and Pdil show a more diagonal and elliptic shape of the xgﬁm
landscape around the global optimum at point Jtca=9.5 umol/min'gdw
and Pdi1=0.45 (A). Insensitivity of parameter Jexc is shown by vertical
elliptic xgﬁm landscape around the global optimum located at Jtca=9.5

Section 2 are given in Supplementary Figure S2.

parameter space, the average xgrim value of all vertices belonging to that
polyhedron was determined. For each of the 10 polyhedrons with the lowest
average xgrim value, its vertex with lowest xgﬁm and the polyhedrons center
point (arithmetic mean) was determined. These two values were additionally
used as starting points for the parameter estimation. Grid points selected
multiple times were only used once. To choose reasonable exploration ranges,
prior knowledge from literature on maximal enzyme capacities and maximal
measured ﬂuxes is used to cover the complete feasible region.

After generating the synthetic datasets with known parameter values and
ﬁnding good start positions (see previous paragraph), a ﬁtting procedure
was used to re—estimate the ‘true’ parameters for all clusters. The parameter
ﬁtting was done by a downhill simplex optimization (Nelder—Mead) with
three consecutive stages. Each stage was terminated when either the
relative change in xgﬁm was below 10—8 or a maximum number of
500 iterations was achieved. While the ﬁrst stage used the initial start
values for optimization, the two subsequent stages utilize the parameter
estimates achieved by the preceding optimization module to continue the
optimization. This multiple stage strategy enables optimization algorithms
to escape local minima. The Nelder—Mead optimization was chosen due to
better performance in re—estimating known parameter values of the TCA
cycle model compared with other approaches (see Supplementary Material
for a comparison of different optimization routines). All parameters were
constrained according to literature information (Carvalho et al., 2001; Sherry
et al., 1998) in the following intervals: Jtca = [0, 64] umol/min gdw, Jexc =
[0,64] umol/min-gdw, TtranS=[0,5] min, Pdi1=[0,1] and Panap=[0,1].
Additionally, the parameter Panap was coupled to a Bayesian prior with an
expected value of 6%:l:3% of the TCA cycle ﬂux.

The results of the parameter re—estimation are discussed in Section 3 and
given in Figure 3. They show that the estimations of the TCA cycle ﬂux
Jtca, the transition time T trans and the relative dilution of the labeled acetyl
coenzyme A pool Pdi] work well. As expected the parameter estimation of
Panap works properly due to the Bayesian prior. However, the estimation
of the exchange ﬂux Jexc shows bias and has a larger SD especially in the
clusters characterized by few detectable multiplet peaks. In order to improve
the estimation of the parameters Jtca and Pdil, we constrained the parameters
Jexc and T trans with additional Bayesian priors derived from the measured
samples with many detectable multiplets (see below).

Error calculations for each individual sample are possible using the
asymptotic standard error for the linearized model [Equation (3)], although
not a priori guaranteed to give accurate results. For the linearized calculation
Bayesian constrained parameters were kept ﬁxed. Simulations showed that

by 25 simulations of the non—linear model with noise (Supplementary Table

Asymptotic error calculations [Equation (3)] on the simulations often
predicted high errors for Jexc and T trans, especially on datasets with a low
number of detectable multiplets. Hence, we constrained these two parameters
with additional Bayesian priors derived from those datasets that gave low
error in the parameter estimates. In these datasets we included all estimates
with linearized error estimates up to twice the minimum error found amongst
the simulations. These minimum error estimates were 2.87 umol/min' gdw
(cluster CLEOH) for the minimum SD of Jexc and 0.13 min for Ttrans (cluster
CLclm), respectively. From the accepted values the average and SD were
determined per cluster and combined into a Bayesian prior for Jexc and T trans.
These priors were than used in addition to the prior for Panap. This additional
prior knowledge improves the estimation of the two parameters (Jtca and Pdil)
that are in particular important for measuring energy metabolism. Please note
that the estimated values of the parameters constrained by Bayesian priors
have of course little value for the individual samples. The results of the
parameter estimation using the three priors are given in Figure 3 and show
that the standard error of the estimate of Jtca and Pdi] was decreased by 19%
and 39% on average relative to one prior.

The parameter ﬁtting procedure with three priors was applied to the
measured samples. Finally, all samples with errors on Jtca and Pdi] higher
than twice the maximum values found in simulations of the control group
(0.205 umol/min' gdw for Jtca in cluster CLE.0n and 0.329 for Pdi] in cluster
CLEOH) were rejected for further analysis.

The oxygen consumption for each heart MVIC‘)‘;art (umol/min' gdw) was

computed by adding its individual biopsy oxygen consumptions MVlgzOpsy

(umol/min. gdw) [Equation (1)] weighted by their dry weights, wbiopsy (g
dry mass), and divided by the sum of all dry weights [Equation (4)]. At
least two samples per heart had to pass the quality criterion. The calculated
oxygen consumptions were then compared with the ‘gold standard’ blood
gas oxygen consumptions measured in the experiments.

This comparison is valid since despite intensive research
(Bassingthwaighte and Beard, 1995; Prinzen and Bassingthwaighte,
2000) designated anatomical regions with consistently higher enzyme
activities or blood ﬂow have not been found. Hence, oxygen consumption
in several small regions can be added and compared with measured oxygen
consumption for the total region which encompasses the small regions plus
surrounding regions.

3 RESULTS

Using the FluxEs program arbitrary metabolic pathways can be
modeled. For the in vivo validation experiment, a model of the
TCA cycle was implemented (Fig. 1) and its ﬂux parameters were
optimized to ﬁt the experimentally measured NMR multiplets.
Oxygen consumption is stoichiometrically coupled to TCA cycle
ﬂux and could therefore be directly calculated from two of these
parameters (Chatham et al., 1995) [Equation (1)]. The optimization
criterion used for the parameter estimation consists of (i) the X2
between the NMR multiplets computed by FluxEs and the NMR
multiplets experimentally measured in the LIPSSS experiment and
(ii) previous knowledge about model parameters added via Bayesian
priors [Equation (2)]. The validation experiments were performed
on 14 pig hearts in vivo under two different metabolic conditions:
basal state and cardiac stress induced by dobutamine. In the same
hearts, myocardial oxygen consumption was quantiﬁed from blood
gas and blood ﬂow measurements. This classic physiological ‘gold
standard’ (Alders et al., 2004) was compared with the LIPSSS
oxygen consumption calculated from the parameter estimates
[Equation (4)].

3.1 Simulations

In order to determine an appropriate parameter estimation strategy,
we investigated a range of metabolic conditions of the data measured
in the LIPSSS experiments. Hierarchical clustering revealed four
clusters in each of the two experimental groups. To simulate the
conditions represented by these eight clusters, we generated 25
synthetic noisy datasets for each of these clusters under controlled
conditions, i.e. with known model parameters. The shape of the
parameter space was analyzed and parameters were re—estimated
from the synthetic data (Section 2).

The investigation of the parameter space revealed a ‘golf course’
landscape with shallow slopes and, sometimes multiple, narrow
minima (see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Material). We found ‘sloppy’

around the global optimum (Fig. 2A). Other parameter combinations
showed low cross—sensitivity (e.g. Jtca and Jexc) indicated by

horizontal or vertical X12) troughs around the global optimum

indicated by the diagonally oriented valleys in the X landscape

1101‘
(Fig. 2B). Since simulation showed the difﬁculty of the parameter
estimation in shallow parameter landscapes using random start
values, we designed another strategy based on a partial grid search
to ﬁnd better start values for parameter ﬁtting.

During the initial parameter re—estimation all parameters (Jtca,
Jexc, Ttrans and Pdil) except Panap were free between a minimum
and maximum value. Based on literature information (Martini
et al., 2002; Panchal et al., 2000, 2001), Panap was coupled to
a Bayesian prior with an expected value of 6%:l:3% of the TCA
cycle ﬂux Jtca. Simulations showed that if prior knowledge on
Panap is not used, its values reach physiologically impossible regions
and make the estimation of the remaining parameters less precise.
The results of the parameter estimation are given in Figure 3
(one prior) and demonstrate that estimation of Jtca, Ttrans and Pdil is
possible within small standard errors and without prior knowledge.
As expected, the estimation of Panap was good due to the prior
knowledge. However, parameter estimation with prior values for
Panap deliberately set wrong (Supplementary Material) show that
the remaining parameters have a low sensitivity for this parameter.
In contrast, the estimation of Jexc is much more difﬁcult and often
shows a high variety in the estimates. Nevertheless, just like Panap,
Jexc does not sensitively affect the remaining parameters.

In order to improve the estimation of the parameters Jtca and Pdil
on datasets with few multiplets, we also constrained parameters JeXC
and Ttrans with additional Bayesian priors (Section 2). The parameter
estimates are given in Figure 3 (three priors) and demonstrate that
the standard deviation of Jtca and Pdﬂ was decreased with 19% and
39% on average. There is no sensitive inﬂuence for the parameter
estimates of Jtca and Pdﬂ by the additionally prior constrained
parameters (Jexc and Ttrans), see Figure 3 (one prior and three priors).
Next, this strategy derived from the simulations was applied to the
experimental data below.

3.2 Testing ﬂux estimation in cardiac tissue samples

in vivo
We tested the new analysis methods for the LIPSSS data by
quantitating aerobic metabolic ﬂuxes in vivo in pig hearts. Acetate

enriched with 13C was infused in a coronary artery in anesthetized

pigs (Section 2). 13C NMR spectra of glutamate in extracts of
multiple contiguous samples from each heart were measured. Up
to nine multiplet intensities were obtained and analyzed with the
FluxEs package to determine the ﬁve metabolic parameters of the
TCA cycle model. Results for the ﬁve metabolic parameters for each
heart are given in Figure 4. One heart of the dobutamine group was
excluded because only one of its eight samples lead to acceptable
parameter estimates (Section 2). The standard error of the mean
reﬂects both real measurement error and true spatial variation of
metabolism among the samples. Spatial variation is substantial in
the heart at the level of TCA cycle enzyme activities and blood
supply of oxygen: blood ﬂow and succinate dehydrogenase enzyme
activity have a true spatial SD of about 20—25% of their average

values across samples of about 40—200 mg dry mass (Alders et al.,
2004 and references cited there).

Despite this substantial contribution of spatial variation across the
samples in each heart, the standard error of the mean for Jtca was of
order 9.5% in the control and 14.3% in the dobutamine group. Based
on the standard error of Jtca in the simulations, which was calculated
using the known NMR measurement error (Fig. 3), we estimate that
on average 1.3 umol/min-gdw of the standard error of Jtca for the
heart (Fig. 4) are due to real spatial variation. The remaining error
is due to measurement error. The acetate uptake, determined by
Jtca - (1 —Pdﬂ) (Fig. 1), is on average 3.53 :l:0.48 umol/min-gdw in
the control group and 2.53 :l:0.49 umol/min- gdw with dobutamine.
These measurements clearly show differences in energy metabolism
across 13 of the 14 hearts. The increase of TCA cycle ﬂux induced
by dobutamine reﬂects the higher cardiac workload (O’Donnell
et al., 2004). In addition, parameter Pdi] demonstrates increased
dilution of acetate with other carbon substrates as found previously
with in vivo NMR (Robitaille et al., 1993). The estimates of Jexc
show that it is lower during dobutamine stimulation. This is in
excellent agreement with a report on reduced 13C label transfer
from a—ketoglutarate to cytosolic glutamate during myocardial
dobutamine stress (O’Donnell et al., 2004). Please note that the
pig with heart Hﬁob (Fig. 4) showed by far the strongest response
to dobutamine: its heart rate increased to 210 beats per minute

compared with 130—178 beats per minute for the other hearts. This
explains the high Jtca and Jexc.

3.3 Testing oxygen consumption

The quantiﬁcation of Jtca and Pdi] using NMR multiplet intensities
from LIPSSS experiments means that the oxygen consumption
in individual samples [Equation (1)] and hence for entire hearts
[Equation (4)] can be calculated. We therefore compared the
calculated oxygen consumption based on the LIPSSS method in the
tissue samples with independently measured oxygen consumption
determined from classic blood gas oxygen and blood ﬂow
measurements. The value calculated from LIPSSS agreed with the
‘gold standard’ physiological measurements (Fig. 5), despite the fact
that the small tissue samples covered only part of the much larger
area that was covered by the blood gas oxygen measurement. The
overall correlation coefﬁcient is r=0.88 (11:13, P < 10—4) and
control and dobutamine group are clearly separated. The LIPSSS
method only measures oxygen consumption linked to TCA cycle
ﬂux. Additional oxygen consumption is also covered by the blood
gas measurements (Challoner, 1968; van Beek et al., 1999), which
may explain part of the higher values. We conclude that there is
agreement between the new method using LIPSSS analyzed with
FluxEs and independent ‘gold standard’ measurements.

4 DISCUSSION

We developed and tested analysis methods and software for
quantitation of metabolic ﬂuxes by in silica simulation of the LIPSSS

protocol and validated the approach in viva in animal LIPSSS
experiments. LIPSSS experiments entail that stable isotope—enriched
metabolic substrates are given to the biological system and that the
level of incorporation of the label in a brief, well—deﬁned period
of time allows determining the speed of metabolic turnover by
computational analysis.

As revealed by simulation (Fig. 3), the parameter estimates for
Jtca and Pdil show low standard errors and were not sensitive to
values of the parameters Jexc, Ttrans and Panap. This means that the
variations in Jexc, Ttrans and Panap have only small effects on the
estimation of Jtca and Pdil. Therefore, we chose to restrict Jexc, Ttrans
and Panap by prior knowledge encoded in Bayesian priors to improve
the estimation of Jtca and Pdﬂ. Furthermore, the in viva experiments
show that Jtca, Jexc and Pdil reveal the expected physiological
differences between the control and the dobutamine—stressed hearts.

Individual differences between the pigs were expected and indeed
observed (Figs 4 and 5). Oxygen consumption calculated from
model parameters corresponds with oxygen consumption measured
from blood gas and are close to the line of identity. It is expected
that oxygen consumption determined from blood gas is higher than
oxygen consumption calculated from the TCA cycle measured with
the LIPSSS protocol. The blood gas uptake includes other oxygen
consuming reactions, e.g. catalyzed by oxygenases or reactive
oxygen species formation in addition to the oxygen consumption
linked to the TCA cycle. Oxygen consumption calculated using
LIPSSS data reﬂects only the reaction with reducing equivalents
produced in the TCA cycle ﬂux. This is in accordance with
the ﬁndings of Challoner (1968). Hence, the expected oxygen
consumption calculated using LIPSSS data is lower than uptake of
oxygen from the blood. Measurements of other oxygen consuming
reactions should be added to TCA cycle—based calculations if
one wants to precisely predict oxygen uptake from the blood.
The differences in metabolism between hearts of the control and
dobutamine group are reﬂected by the higher average oxygen
consumption in the dobutamine group (high workload) compared
with the control group.

We have preliminary evidence that in future versions of the
software package (FluxEs 2.0) it is possible to implement (i) on
the ﬂy C code generation that makes simulations 15 times faster,
(ii) determination of optimal start values for parameter optimization
using a particle swarm algorithm (Kennedy and Eberhart, 1995), (iii)
simulation of NMR multiplet time series for multiple metabolites,
(iv) parameter optimization using NMR multiplet time series
of multiple metabolites, and (v) multiple nonlinear optimization
routines.

In conclusion, FluxEs is a framework designed for parameter
estimation in metabolic models by ﬁtting simulated NMR multiplets
against multiplets measured during LIPSSS experiments. FluxEs can
ﬂexibly handle arbitrary metabolic pathways that are not in isotopic
steady state and will work on most computer operating systems.
FluxEs was validated on NMR measurements from multiple tissue
biopsies from pig hearts. The LIPSSS protocol, based on taking
biopsies at a single time point, potentially has much higher spatial
and biochemical resolution than in viva NMR experiments. We
anticipate that the LIPSSS approach in combination with the
easy to use computer package FluxEs will prove applicable to
many metabolic pathways and biological systems, such as central
metabolism in cancer biopsies as well as neurotransmitter and central
metabolism in neural cell cultures and animal studies.

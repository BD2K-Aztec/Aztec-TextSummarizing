Abstract

Motivation: Increasing evidences suggest that most of the genome is transcribed into RNAs, but
many of them are not translated into proteins. All those RNAs that do not become proteins are
called ‘non—coding RNAs (ncRNAs)’, which outnumbers protein—coding genes. Interestingly, these
ncRNAs are shown to be more tissue specifically expressed than protein—coding genes. Given that
tissue—specific expressions of transcripts suggest their importance in the expressed tissue, re—
searchers are conducting biological experiments to elucidate the function of such ncRNAs. Owing
greatly to the advancement of next—generation techniques, especially RNA—seq, the amount of
high—throughput data are increasing rapidly. However, due to the complexity of the data as well as
its high volume, it is not easy to re—analyze such data to extract tissue—specific expressions of
ncRNAs from published datasets.

Results: Here, we introduce a new knowledge database called ‘C—It—Loci’, which allows a user
to screen for tissue—specific transcripts across three organisms: human, mouse and zebrafish. C—It—
Loci is intuitive and easy to use to identify not only protein—coding genes but also ncRNAs from
various tissues. C—It—Loci defines homology through sequence and positional conservation to allow
for the extraction of species—conserved loci. C—It—Loci can be used as a starting point for further bio—
logical experiments.

Availability and implementation: C—It—Loci is freely available online without registration at http://

1 Introduction

 

A series of articles by ‘Functional Annotation Of Mammalian gen-
ome (FANTOM)’ projects (Carninci et 61]., 2005), ‘ENCyclopedia Of
DNA Elements (ENCODE)’ consortium (Consortium, 2012), and
others clearly indicate that a majority of genome is transcribed in the
form of RNAs, yet only few percentages of them fall under the cat—
egory of protein—coding genes. The current estimate is that less than
3% of the mammalian genome encodes for protein—coding genes
(Lander et 61]., 2001; Uchida et 61]., 2012; Uchida and Dimmeler,

2015). Previously, many of the remaining RNAs were discarded as
transcriptional noises and experimental errors. However, through
the discovery of microRNAs (miRNAs) and other non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) (e.g. long non—coding RNAs (lncRNAs)), it became evi—
dent that RNAs have functions beyond templates for protein expres—
sion. The concept of ncRNAs is not new, as ribosomal RNAs
(rRNAs) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) do not encode for proteins but
are necessary for protein translation. Given such a complex reality of
transcriptomes, lncRNAs are an immensely important topic of study

for understanding biological systems. Furthermore they are of major
interest in medicine with a huge range of potential applications from
the detection of neurological diseases and treatments, anticancer
therapies, and even cardiac regeneration (Uchida et al., 2012;
Qureshi and Mehler, 2013; Tang et al., 2013). However, compared
to protein—coding genes, the functions of lncRNAs are poorly under-
stood. One of the major reasons is that lncRNAs exhibit low se—
quence conservation, making evolutionary comparison difficult.
Indeed, a recent study using a computational pipeline for homology-
based comparison found that only 3.4% of lncRNAs share sequence
conservation between human and other non-marsupial mammals
(Derrien et al., 2012) [compared to 85% of protein—coding genes be—
tween human and mice (Batzoglou et al., 2000)]. Although lncRNAs
are poorly conserved among species, their expression patterns are
distinct compared to those of protein—coding genes as a majority of
lncRNAs (both with high and low sequence conservation) is ex—
pressed in a tissue—specific manner (Cabili et al., 2011). Furthermore,
when a set of highly conserved lncRNAs was examined, their tissue
expressions are conserved between species (Derrien et al., 2012).
Since it is highly unlikely that the level of (convergent) evolution has
occurred to allow for the specificity of lncRNAs when comparing to
their poor sequence conservation, it is possible that evolutionary
pressure is effective but not on a sequence—specific manner, which
might suggests a sequence—independent way to understand the con—
servation of lncRNAs is necessary. Indeed, a number of methods
have already been explored. One is based on the observation that the
secondary structures of a number of lncRNAs are conserved
(Johnsson et al., 2014). However, a large—scale attempt using such
methodology is still impeded by poor understanding of secondary
structures of RNA in general (Johnsson et al., 2014). Other studies
have observed that promoter regions of lncRNAs are relatively con-
served even when compared to those of protein—coding genes
(Guttman et al., 2009; Derrien et al., 2012). Although defining spe-
cies—conservation via promoters is valuable, recent evidences from
chromatin conformational capture assays (e.g. 3C, 4C, Hi—C) suggest
that a promoter and enhancer could be up to 120kb from the tran-
scription start sites (TSS) of a gene to control its expression (Sanyal
et al., 2012). If this applies to the mammalian genome, it would be
difficult to define which region is controlling the expression of one
gene but not the other.

To overcome these challenges, in this study, we introduced pos—
itional conservation based on the idea that certain regions of the
genome are conserved from one species to another. This region is
defined as a pair of adjacent genes, which share adjacency and hom—
ology when compared across another species. Applying this concept
to three organisms (human, mouse and zebrafish), we built a know—
ledge database called ‘C—It—Loci’ (http://c—it—loci.uni—frankfurt.de)
using published RNA—seq datasets from various studies covering dif—
ferent tissues. Using C—It—Loci, we revisited the idea of tissue specifi—
city of protein—coding genes and lncRNAs. Furthermore, we
examined the definition of housekeeping genes and applied its con—
cept to screen for housekeeping lncRNAs. To show the applicability
of C—It—Loci, we screened for tissue—specific lncRNAs and confirmed
their expressions in the target tissues by surveying publicly—available
biological experimental data.

of CGP. The genomic coordinates from one protein-coding gene (‘Gene A') to
the immediately downstream protein-coding gene (‘Gene 8') are defined as
one locus unit. When homologous protein-coding genes are found in another
species for both protein-coding genes in the locus, this locus is defined as
‘conserved locus', which we called ‘C-lt-Loci Genomic Positions (CGP)'

sapiens, Mus musculus and Danio rerio, respectively (Flicek et al.,
2014). Of note, in the case of human genome, hg38 significantly dif-
fers from its previous human genome assembly hg19 (Supplementary

Table 81).

2.1 Generation of conserved regions

Three types of conserved regions were considered. The first type is
‘positional conservation’ (called ‘C—It—Loci Genomic Positions
(CGP)’) based on the presences of conserved protein pairs (Fig. 1b).
They are defined as the set of all pairs of adjacent protein—coding
genes within an organism’s genome, which are also adjacent when
compared to orthologs of another species. Corresponding ortholo—
gous pairs were found using the Ensembl Compara database via
Ensembl’s REST API (Yates et al., 2015). A total of 9757 conserved
gene pairs are shared between two or all species in C—It—Loci.

The second region type is based on the ultraconserved elements,
which are species—conserved regions that are shown to be transcrip—
tional regulators of key developmental genes (Bejerano et al., 2004).
The information about these regions was downloaded from
UCNEbase (Dimitrieva and Bucher, 2013). UCNEbase (http://ccg.
vital—it.ch/UCNEbase) is a database of ultra—conserved non—coding
elements (UCNEs). It contains two types of data: the individual
UCNEs themselves and genomic regulatory blocks

(UGRBs). UCNEs were defined as non—coding DNA regions
with Z 95% sequence identity between human and chicken and iden-
tified via whole—genome alignment. UGRBs or ‘UCNE clusters’ are
arrays of UCNEs, which are syntenically conserved (i.e. orthologs

served regions among three organisms used in this study

that are in the same order) between the human and chicken genomes
and generally within > 0.5 mega bases (mb) of each other.
Orthologous and paralogous regions were identified with and be—
tween other species using the program SSEARCH and additional
statistical methods regions with E—values less than 1e—4. UGRBs
range in size from 4.9 mb to 2 kilobases (kb) and an average of 16
UCNEs. A total of 240 UCNE clusters are included in C—It—Loci.

The third type is based on the species—conserved cis—regulatory
elements (enhancers) that are experimentally validated in transgenic
mice (Pennacchio et al., 2006). The information about these regions
was downloaded from the VISTA Enhancer Browser database (Visel
et al., 2007) (http://enhancer.lbl.gov). The enhancer elements used
in VISTA were selected for their conservation between human
and several non—mammalian vertebrates or extreme conservation
(2 200bp regions with 100% identity) between human, mouse and
rat. To allow for the detection of transcripts around these enhancers,
300 kb upstream and downstream were added to the VISTA regions
as enhancers have been shown to act independent of strand and at
distances of up to several hundred kb (Maston et al., 2006). A total
of 215 8 VISTA—conserved regions are included in C—It—Loci.

For the conversion between different genomic assemblies,
CrossMap (Zhao et al., 2014) was utilized. In total, 1462 regions
share among all species, whereas 9722 between human and mouse,
2749 between human and zebrafish, and 2608 mouse and zebrafish
(Fig. 2). The average sizes (in base pairs) of the regions for CGP,
UCNEbase, and VISTA regions are 178 097, 337429 and 601 879,
respectively, and their standard deviations are 314 064, 556 697 and
1317, respectively. There were 11 725 regions containing lncRNAs.
Of these, 8409 regions share a lncRNA among more than one
tissue, and 511 within all three species. Furthermore, 7881 of these
regions also contained the same biotype of lncRNA, and 3768 the
same enriched tissue, region, and biotype. The overlapped re—
gions among three conservation types are shown in Supplementary
Figure S2.

2.2 RNA—seq assembly

Raw sequence datasets were downloaded from the NCBI Sequence
Read Archive as SRA files or from EBI as fastq files (Kodama et al.,
2012; McWilliam et al., 2013). In total, 119 RNA—seq datasets were
utilized in this study (Supplementary Table S2): 28 human

vided to screen for tissue ‘expressed‘, ‘enriched’ and ‘specific’ conserved re-
gions as well as transcripts that are separated between protein-coding genes
and lncRNAs. Two tissues can be compared for the expressions. (b) Results
of quick search. Transcripts enriched in both heart and muscle are screened

(Taxonomy ID: 9606), 78 mouse (Taxonomy ID: 10090) and 13
zebrafish (Taxonomy ID: 7955). In the case of SRA files, fastq—
dump (version 2.1.7) was use to convert the SRA files to fastq files
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra). The first 10 bases of all reads
(i.e. adaptor sequences) were removed with fastx—trimmer (version
0.0.13) (Pearson et al., 1997). Although there are different bioinfor-
matics tools to analyze RNA—seq available, we chose to map the
trimmed reads with Tophat (version 2.0.11) and to annotate them
with Cufﬂinks (version 2.2.1) as this pipeline has been shown to out—
perform others when the reference genome is given (Engstrom et al.,
2013). Both programs were used with the default setting with the
Ensembl version 77 GTF annotations. Only annotated transcripts
with FPKM (Fragments Per Kilobase of exon per Million fragments
mapped) values greater than 1e—5 were added to the C—It—Loci
database.

2.3 The C—lt—Loci database

All the information and analyzed RNA—seq data were stored in
MySQL (Supplementary Fig. S1). For the web interface, the
CakePHP web framework was utilized. C—It—Loci allows users to ex—
plore the data from the following three main views: ‘REGIONS
(conserved regions)’, ‘GENES’ and ‘TRANSCRIPTS’ (Fig. 3). Each
view allows users to browse the data in order of accession as well as
to execute a search by a gene name or accession. Furthermore, query
tags are allowed to specify searches based on various other types of
data (e.g. taxonomy, tissue specificity). The search terms can be
combined in any combination and number with the Boolean oper—
ators ‘and’, ‘or’, ‘not’ and ‘()’. A wildcard is also allowed.

From the top page of C—It—Loci, a quick search function is pro—
vided for a tissue of interest or in comparison to another tissue.
Here, it is possible to screen for expressed (FPKM values above
zero), enriched (FPKM values greater than or equal to the average of
all tissues for the target transcript), or specific (expressed only in the
target tissue) transcripts.

‘sncRNAs‘ stands for short non-coding RNAs. In general, the similar trend of
tissue-specific expressions of lncRNAs compared to those of protein-coding
genes are observed for human, mouse and zebrafish

Gene Ontology (GO) annotations were obtained from the GO
annotations available for each transcript on the Ensembl database.
The GO terms available from the gene view are simply the unique set
of GO terms for each transcript produced by the gene. For each GO
term, a link to AmiGo 2 is provided (http://amigo.geneontology.org/
amigo) (Ashburner et al., 2000).

2.4 Exon array analysis

The sample dataset consisting of 11 tissues of human and mouse
were downloaded from Affymetrix, Inc. The CEL files were up-
loaded to our noncoder web interface (Gellert et al., 2013). The
data were pre—processed using RMA algorithm (Bolstad et al.,
2003). To calculate the correlation between exon arrays and RNA—
seq, the information from ENSEMBL was paired with the micro—
array data. Any exon array entry matching multiple transcripts was
mapped to all potential RNA—seq transcripts. To allow for the com—
parison between exon array and RNA—seq datasets, any Transcript
Cluster IDs on exon array with no RNA—Seq expression were
removed from the further analysis.

2.5 Screening for housekeeping lncRNAs

The previously described set of housekeeping protein—coding genes
(Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013) was downloaded from http://www.
tau.ac.il/~elieis/HKG/. Based on this list, a standard deviation (SD)
was calculated for each housekeeping protein—coding gene using
FPKM values across tissues. Then, an average SD was derived for
housekeeping protein—coding genes. Using this average SD as a
threshold, when a standard deviation of the FPKM values of the
lncRNA is lower than that of the average SD, we defined this
lncRNA to be a ‘housekeeping lncRNA’.

2.6 Expression patterns of lncRNAs compared to those
of protein—coding genes

Previous studies indicate that lncRNAs are more tissue specifically
expressed than protein—coding genes (Derrien et al., 2012). To test

The band inside the box shows the median, whereas the whiskers represent
O3+1.5*IOR (interquartile range, 03-01) for the top and O1-1.5*IOR for the
bottom. Across tissues, the box-and-whisker plots show that the median
FPKM values of HK protein-coding genes vary significantly, especially for
bladder. HK lncRNAs show similar distribution across tissues, but their FPKM
values are 10-fold lower than those of protein-coding genes

whether such a trend holds true, the transcripts in C—It—Loci were
screened across various tissues (Fig. 4). Compared to protein—coding
genes, high percent of transcripts are specifically expressed only in a
few tissues. Furthermore, this trend holds even more when the
threshold for minimum FPKM values was increased. Based on these
results, we could confirm that lncRNAs are generally lowly ex-
pressed compared to protein—coding genes, and their expression pat—
terns are more tissue—specific than those of protein—coding genes.
However, we also noted the presence of lncRNAs whose expressions
are detected in all tissues included in C—It—Loci even FPKM values
above 5, which corresponds to more than one RNA molecule per
cell when homogenous cell type was considered (Mortazavi et al.,
2008)

Given that there exist so—called ‘housekeeping (HK) genes’ that
are expressed in various tissues at the relatively constant level, we
questioned whether there are such HK lncRNAs exist or not. By
using the list of 3804 HK protein—coding genes (Eisenberg and
Levanon, 2013), we first examined their expression levels in the tis—
sues deposited into C—It—Loci. As reported in the original article
(Eisenberg and Levanon, 2013), the expression levels of these HK
protein—coding genes vary quite significantly when the whole tran-
script is considered compared to that of exon, which the authors
used, indicating that the expressions of HK protein—coding genes are
not as constant as one would expect when they are examined at the
tissue level (Fig. 5a). Next, we calculated an average standard devi—
ation of FPKM values of 3804 HK protein—coding genes across all
tissues and use this standard deviation (1.258 in log2 of FPKM val-
ues) to screen for HK lncRNAs. Using this criterion, we were able to
identify 959 HK lncRNAs. Although their standard deviation of
FPKM values are similar to those of HK protein—coding genes, their
median FPKM values for human are 10—fold lower than those of HK
protein—coding genes (Fig. 5b).

Next, we questioned whether HK protein—coding genes and
lncRNAs are located closely to each other on the genome or not. In
the case of HK protein—coding genes, 534 loci are in between HK
protein—coding genes and 2777 loci with one HK protein—coding
gene in either up or downstream genomic location. When HK
lncRNAs were examined, 428 out of 95 9 HK lncRNAs are located
in 609 loci. Of 609 loci, 36 loci are in between HK protein—coding

2.7 Comparison to microarray data

Since 1990s, microarrays have been a technology of choice for
transcriptomics studies. In our previous study (Gellert et al., 2013),
we compared the results of microarrays (exon arrays) to those of
RNA—seq data for the selected set of samples. Here, we revisited
our previous study with more tissues and more comprehensive ana—
lysis of RNA—seq data (Fig. 6). In the case of protein—coding genes,
the correlations between fold changes of RNA—seq and exon array
data are very high. The best scores are Pearson correlation of
R2=0.669 between skeletal muscle and testis for human and
R2 = 0.825 between lung and testis for mice and. In contrast, cor—
relations for lncRNAs are noticeably weaker in general. However,
in some cases, correlations are comparable to those of protein—
coding genes: R2=0.669 between skeletal muscle and testis for
human and R2=0.723 between heart and testis for mice. The
lower correlations for lncRNAs are likely due to a number of fac—
tors. First, the probe coverage of lncRNAs on exon arrays is lower
compared to those of protein—coding genes (at least 4 probes per
exon of a protein—coding gene) as exon arrays are designed to de—
tect exons of protein—coding genes rather than lncRNAs. Second, as
we pointed in our previous study (Gellert et al., 2013) and con—
firmed further in Figure 4, lncRNAs are lower expressed than pro—
tein—coding genes opening the possibility of greater experimental
errors. Given such differences, compare to microarrays, RNA—seq
data provide more reliable expressions of lncRNAs in various
tissues, which C—It—Loci is based on.

Although C—It—Loci is based on the experimental data (i.e. RNA—
seq), it is important to test the validity of the information and

functionalities of C—It—Loci in the context of biological experiments.
For this purpose, we carried out a case study for long intergenic
ncRNAs (lincRNAs). The Allen Brain Atlas (http://www.brain—
map.org) provides detailed information about transcripts expressed
in the human and mouse brains, including in situ hybridization re-
sults of mouse brain. To test the validity of our C—It—Loci,
from the ‘TRANSCRIPTS’ tab, mouse lincRNAs that are brain—
specific within CGP conserved region are screened using the fol—
lowing query: ‘TAXID:10090 and BIOTYPEzlincRNA and
SPECIFICzBrain and REGIONTYPEzCGP’. This query yielded 22
transcripts from 20 genes (Supplementary Table S3). Of these 20
genes, three are included in the Allen Brain Atlas. In the case of
Meg3, both Meg3-002 (ENSMUST00000124106) and Meg3-004
(ENSMUST00000143272) are highly expressed (FPKM values of
435.831 and 193.165, respectively) (Fig. 7a and b). Indeed, when
the in situ hybridization images provided by the Allen Brain Atlas
were examined, Meg3 is highly expressed in the mouse adult brain
(Fig. 7c). Two others are lowly expressed: A130030D18Rik
(FPKM=0.046) and A930104D05Ri/e (FPKM=0.033). When in
situ images were examined, their expressions are region-specific in
the brain, which explains their low FPKM values when whole brain
was considered for RNA—seq data (Fig. 7d and e). By examining the
in situ hybridization results of mouse brain, it is possible to confirm
the expression patterns and to observe the correlation of FPKM val—
ues to the experimental data using different technique for the detec—
tion of transcripts.

3 Discussion

In this study, we analyzed RNA—seq data of various tissues from
human, mouse and zebrafish. Using the latest genomic assemblies
from Ensembl, we annotated each detected transcripts with detailed
biotypes known to the scientific community to avoid ambiguity cur—
rently existing in the field of lncRNAs (Uchida and Dimmeler,
2015 ). The analyzed datasets can be explored through our C—It—Loci
knowledge database, which allows users to screen for tissue—
expressed, enriched and specific transcripts. C—It—Loci was built to
assist researchers with a limited knowledge about analysis of RNA—
seq data as well as bioinformatics and computational programs. An
easy—to—use quick search function is provided at the top page of C—It—
Loci so that users can perform an in silico screening of transcripts
that are expressed, enriched and/or specific by comparing up to two
tissues. As an output of such in silico screening, easy—to—view Venn
diagrams are provided for conserved regions and transcripts for pro—
tein—coding genes and lncRNAs separately. These Venn diagrams
are clickable, which jumps to the table that lists all the identified
conserved regions or transcripts. From this table, users can explore
the detailed information about each entry. In the detailed informa-
tion page for conserved region, gene, or transcript, Ensembl ID is
provided along with an official gene name and symbol, genomic pos—
ition and biotype. Furthermore, link out to Ensembl database and
the UCSC Genome Browser are provided. Within the same page,
genome browser is implemented so that users can visually inspect
the location of the identified gene and its corresponding transcripts
(i.e. isoforms). In addition, a heat map is provided to examine the
expression patterns of the identified gene and its isoforms. A tab is
implemented to view only for those expressed tissues as well as nu—
merical FPKM values are provided in the table format. In the case of
the identified gene that follows under conserved regions, a list of
conserved regions and their region types are provided along with the
links to the corresponding information. Since gene ontology terms
are often used in the research community to categorize protein—cod—
ing genes, GO terms are provided along with the link to the corres—
ponding information page provided by AmiGO 2.

There are many databases available that contain expressions of
protein—coding genes across various tissues, including our own ‘C—It’
knowledge database (Gellert et al., 2010). In the case of lncRNAs,
there are three databases available that include the expressions of
lncRNAs across tissues; namely, lncRNAMap (Chan et al., 2014),
lncRNAtor (Park et al., 2014) and NONCODE (Xie et al., 2014).
lncRNAMap is limited to human lncRNAs and provides a link out
to the UCSC Genome Browser for expression data, whereas
lncRNAtor and NONCODE include more species. Of these three
databases, lncRNAtor includes the most amount of next—generation
sequencing datasets, including RNA—seq. Compared to these data—
bases, our C—It—Loci differs in the following points. First, the latest
genomic assembly for human (hg38) is utilized, whereas all the other
databases are based on hg19, which was released in February 2009,
and numerous transcripts are not included or ambiguously anno—
tated (Supplementary Table S1). Second, C—It—Loci allows an in sil-
ico screening of tissue—expressed, enriched and specific transcripts
by comparing two tissues, whose function is missing in all other
databases. Supplementary Table S4 is provided to give an overview
of tissue—specific transcripts in each tissue. Such information can
only be obtained through C—It—Loci, which would be valuable to
conduct loss—of—function studies to elucidate the functions of such
tissue—specific transcripts, including yet-function-unknown
lncRNAs. Third, C-It-Loci defines homologous lncRNAs among
three organisms, which are not so well defined in all the other

databases. Of note, while our study was underway, LNCipededia
(Volders et al., 2015), which is a database for human lncRNAs,
introduced a similar method of defining homology based on gen—
omic position. However, LNCipedia does not provide a list of con—
served mouse and zebrafish lncRNAs. In our C—It—Loci, we utilized
three types of conserved regions and provided all the transcripts that
follow under each conserved region. Of all the databases of protein—
coding genes and lncRNAs currently available to the research
community, our C—It—Loci is the only database that includes both
protein—coding genes and lncRNAs as well as other types of tran—
scripts [e.g. small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs)]. We anticipate that
our C—It—Loci serves as a start point for conducting functional stud—
ies in tissue—enriched/specific transcripts, including lncRNAs.

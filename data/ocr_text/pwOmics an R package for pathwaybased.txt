Abstract

Summary: Characterization of biological processes is progressively enabled with the increased
generation of omics data on different signaling levels. Here we present a straightforward approach
for the integrative analysis of data from different high—throughput technologies based on pathway
and interaction models from public databases. pWOmics performs pathway—based level—specific
data comparison of coupled human proteomic and genomic/transcriptomic datasets based on their
log fold changes. Separate downstream and upstream analyses results on the functional levels of
pathways, transcription factors and genes/transcripts are performed in the cross—platform consen—
sus analysis. These provide a basis for the combined interpretation of regulatory effects over time.
Via network reconstruction and inference methods (Steiner tree, dynamic Bayesian network
inference) consensus graphical networks can be generated for further analyses and visualization.

Availability and implementation: The R package pWOmics is freely available on Bioconductor

1 Introduction

High-throughput technologies applied in systems biology research
generate large amounts of molecular information nowadays.
Interpretation of genome— and proteome—wide data is dependent on
current analysis tools. As each technique shows a certain bias and
has natural limitations in identifying full signaling responses (Yeger-
Lotem et 61]., 2009), cross—platform analysis is an up—to—date ap—
proach in order to connect biological implications on different sig-
naling levels. Usage of diverse data types provides a deeper
understanding of global biological functions and the underlying
processes (Kholodenko et 61]., 2012). Thus, development of integra—
tive software solutions for data from different high—throughput tech-
niques is a current major challenge for bioinformatic analysis.
Existing widely used commercial software solutions such as
QIAGEN’s Ingenuity® Pathway Analysis (IPA®, QIAGEN
Redwood City, www.qiagen.com/ingenuity) or MetaCore (GeneGo,
Inc., St. Joseph, MI) and also open—source software, such as

Cytoscape (Shannon et 61]., 2003), often handle proteomic and gen-
omic/transcriptomic data as if coming from the same functional
level. More specific integration tools which are considering these
levels include, e.g. the web tool IMPaLA (Kamburov et 61]., 2011),
which provides knowledge based data integration on transcriptom—
ics or proteomics data combined with metabolomics data, and the
webserver SteinerNet (Tuncbag et 61]., 2012), which enables
integration of transcriptional, proteomic and interactome data
utilizing Steiner trees. However, prmics combines these distinct
omics levels of evidence in order to refine the understanding of
molecular mechanisms including the biologically important time ef—
fect. Thereby, it joins tools used for network analysis (Kristensen et
61]., 2014), but adds a level of complexity by attributing weight to
the different functional levels of measurement in the first place and
the dimension of time in the second place. We implemented
prmics as open—source package for R, a free software environ-
ment for statistical computing commonly used for bioinformatic
analyses.

2 Approach

prmics provides analyses functionalities and comparative integra—
tion features for coupled human proteome and genome/transcrip—
tome datasets. The analysis workflow is adapted to account for the
biological control mechanisms occurring on the different regulation
levels such as transcriptional control on gene level, mRNA process—
ing on transcript level and post—translational modifications on pro—
tein level, as illustrated in Figure 1. The two datasets are initially
analyzed separately enabling a level—specific interpretation of up—
and downstream changes of regulatory molecules. The protein based
downstream analysis comprises the pathway—based identification of
transcription factors (TF) of differentially abundant proteins and
their target genes. The gene/transcription based upstream analysis
identifies TFs and proteomic regulators based on differentially ex—
pressed transcripts or genes. As high—throughput data are increas—
ingly used to follow time—dependent biological regulation after
perturbation, the main benefit of prmics is the cross—platform
time series analysis functionality, but consensus analysis can be per—
formed also on single time point measurements.

3 Package features
3.1 Databases

Existing knowledge stored in public databases is a key element for
data integration in the approach outlined above (Kramer et 61].,
2014). Databases used here are pathway databases, TF—target data—
bases and a protein—protein interaction database. Pathway data—
bases can be selected individually or as combination of KEGG
(Kanehisa et 61]., 2014), Reactome (Croft et 61]., 2014), Pathway
Interaction Database (Schaefer et 61]., 2009) and Biocarta
(Nishimura, 2001). The information is used as gene sets in the
downstream analysis and combined with topological information in
upstream analysis. Prior knowledge for network reconstruction is
based on the connected graph from protein—protein-interaction
(PPI) database STRING (Franceschini et 61]., 2013). For TF—target
gene identification processes the user can choose from databases
ChEA (Lachmann et 61]., 2010) and/or Pazar (Portales—Casamar et
61]., 2009) or specify an own file, e.g. containing commercial data—
base information.

3.2 Individual comparative analysis
In the individual analysis database information is used to identify sig—
naling molecules of the different functional levels for a level—specific

results of a static consensus analysis, a dynamic analysis and the time profile

comparison. Identification of pathways containing differentially
abundant proteins is performed via a Biopax model generated by the
R package rBiopaxParser (Kramer et 61]., 2013) on basis of the se—
lected pathway databases. Enrichment of pathways in downstream
analysis and TFs in upstream analysis is optional. Upstream regula—
tors of TFs are identified via their pathways, but only those path—
ways are considered further which contain a user—specified number
of TFs. Overlapping proteins found as neighbors of a certain order
of those TFs are assumed to be proteomic regulators. Easy access to
the individual level results is provided.

3.3 Consensus analysis

In the consensus analysis the intersection of signaling molecules on
each functional level is identified and used for building consensus nets.
For each matching time point a Steiner tree (Sadeghi and Fréhlich,
2013) is generated (implemented via the shortest paths based approxi—
mation algorithm) on the basis of intersecting proteins and TFs from
up— and downstream analysis and the connected PPI STRING network.
For this network reconstruction method intersecting molecules re—
garded as ‘terminal nodes’ are mapped to the PPI—network and those
pathway components on shortest interconnecting paths are included
which provide the shortest length of the overall network. Subsequently
intersecting TF—target relations are included to contribute to the static
consensus graphs for each matching time point. The dynamic consen-
sus analysis additionally considers signaling changes over time by
applying dynamic Bayesian network inference via the R package
ebdeet (Rau et 61]., 2010). Nodes considered in this step are those
identified in all static consensus graphs. With smoothing splines an ap—
propriate number of time points are generated under the simplifying as—
sumption of a gradual change of signaling over time. This longitudinal
dataset is then used for the inference step. The result allows a signifi-
cance level—based visualization of the dynamic Bayesian network.

3.4 Time profile clustering

To identify similar co—regulation patterns over time prmics pro—
vides an integrated time profile clustering, based on the soft cluster—
ing fuzzy c-means algorithm implemented in the R package Mfuzz
(Kumar et 61]., 2007). The soft—clustering approach has the advan—
tage of assigning several clusters to one signaling molecule based on
similarity of log-fold change dynamics to several clusters. Thus it en—
ables an adequate clustering of complex expression time profiles,
which are characterized by fine—tuned transcriptional mechanisms.

3.5 Data visualization

For easier biological interpretation users can visualize following re-
sults: (i) Static consensus nets—based on matching time point com-
parisons of the two datasets. (ii) Dynamic consensus net—based on
dynamic Bayesian network inference. (iii) Time profile clustering—
based on softly clustered log—fold changes with a combined visual—
ization of proteins and genes/transcripts.

4 Summary

We developed an R package as integrative pathway—based level—
specific tool for the analysis and interpretation of signaling meas-
ured in parallel on different platforms. The presented approach
enables the reduction of results to a very reliable set of regulatory
signaling components, time profile clustering and the interpretation
of static and dynamic consensus results. Further details and ex—
amples are provided in the package documentation.

Abstract

Motivation: Enhancers are of short regulatory DNA elements. They can be bound with proteins
(activators) to activate transcription of a gene, and hence play a critical role in promoting gene tran—
scription in eukaryotes. With the avalanche of DNA sequences generated in the post—genomic age,
it is a challenging task to develop computational methods for timely identifying enhancers from ex—
tremely complicated DNA sequences. Although some efforts have been made in this regard, they
were limited at only identifying whether a query DNA element being of an enhancer or not.
According to the distinct levels of biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes, how—
ever, enhancers should be further classified into strong and weak ones in strength.

Results: In View of this, a two—layer predictor called ‘iEnhancer-ZL’ was proposed by formulating
DNA elements with the ‘pseudo k—tuple nucleotide composition’, into which the six DNA local par—
ameters were incorporated. To the best of our knowledge, it is the first computational predictor
ever established for identifying not only enhancers, but also their strength. Rigorous cross—
validation tests have indicated that iEnhancer-ZL holds very high potential to become a useful tool
for genome analysis.

Availability and implementation: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a web server
for the two—layer predictor was established at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer—2L/, by which
users can easily get their desired results without the need to go through the mathematical details.

1 Introduction

Enhancers are distinct genomic regions that can upregulate tran— be 20 kb or further away from a gene, or even located on a different
scription of target genes through interaction With transcription fac— chromosome. This feature makes the prediction of enhancer a chal—
tors (TF5) (Shlyueva et 61]., 2014). In contrast to gene proximal lenging task.

Experimental methods, such as chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by deep sequencing (Heintzman and Ren, 2009), can suc—
cessfully detect many regulatory enhancers by targeting enhancer
binding TF, such as P300 (Heintzman et 61]., 2007; Visel et 61].,
2009). But TF only binds to enhancers in a cell—specific manner. Not
all of the functional enhancers are occupied by a certain TF. Besides,
active enhancers are nucleosome—depleted open regions, which dis—
play deoxyribonuclease or DNase I hypersensitivity (Boyle et 61].,
2011). But, many other DNA elements, such as promoters, are also
accessible by DNase I. The histones in the flanking nucleosomes of
enhancer often carry characteristic post—translational modifications.
Accordingly, genome—wide mapping of histone modifications (Ernst
et 61]., 2011; Erwin et 61]., 2014; Fernandez and Miranda—Saavedra,
2012; Firpi et al., 2010; Kleftogiannis et 61]., 2015; Rajagopal et 61].,
2013) allows accurate determination and classification of enhancers
and promoters. For instance, the open chromatin regions flanked by
histone modifications, such as H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, have been
classified as strong enhancers, while the regions ﬂanked by
H3K4me1 classified as weak enhancers (Fig. 1). These kinds of tech—
niques have now been widely used and the results thus obtained are
quite consistent with the enhancer activity assays.

Unfortunately, the experimental methods by the aforementioned
authors are expensive and time consuming. Therefore, several com—
putational methods were developed in an attempt to timely predict
enhancers in genomes. These methods differ in operation algorithms
and input features. For instance, Firpi et al. (2010) developed a pre—
dictor called CSI—ANN by using an Artificial Neural Network
(ANN) approach combined with efficient data transformation and
feature extraction. Fernandez and Miranda—Saavedra (2012) pro—
posed a support vector machine (SVM) classifier called
ChromeGenSVM by employing a genetic algorithm to optimize spe—
cific histone epigenetic marks in feature selection process. Using
the random forest algorithm, Rajagopal et al. (2013) proposed a
predictor called RFECS to identify enhancers. By combining a
multiple kernel learning method and evolutionary conservation,

Weak enhancer

open chromatin regions flanked by histone modifications (such as H3K4me3
and H3K27ac) are of strong enhancer (top), while those flanked by H3K4me1
are of weak enhancer (bottom)

Erwin et al. (2014) developed a different enhancer predictor
called EnhancerFinder. Considering the inherent limitation of the
conventional k—mers approach due to the high—dimension and over—
fitting problems, Ghandi et al. (2014) utilized the gapped k—mers to
develop a classifier named GKM—SVM for identifying enhancers.
Very recently, using an ensemble prediction framework,
Kleftogiannis et al. (2015) developed a novel predictor called DEEP
and they claimed that it performed better than the four state—of—the—
art methods in identifying enhancers.

Although the aforementioned computational methods can yield
quite encouraging results and each of them has its own advantage, fur—
ther work is needed due to the following reasons. Most of those stud—
ies were focused on discriminating enhancers from other regulatory
elements. But it was shown that enhancers are a large group of func—
tional elements with many different subgroups, such as, strong enhan—
cers, weak enhancers and poised or inactive enhancers (Shlyueva
et 61]., 2014), implying that enhancers of distinct subgroups will have
different biological activities and regulatory effects on target genes.
Therefore, in order to really understand the mechanism underlying
the gene regulation through enhancers, it is indispensable to classify
them according to their attributes to these subgroups. This study was
initiated in an attempt to address this problem.

According to the Chou’s 5 —step rule (Chou, 2011) and performed
in a series of recent publications (Chen et 61]., 2014; Ding et 61]., 2014;
Jia et al., 2015a; Lin et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014; Xu et al., 2014a,
2015), to establish a really useful sequence—based statistical predictor
for a biological system, we should consider the following five proced—
ures: (1) construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test
the predictor; (2) formulate the biological sequence samples with an
effective mathematical expression that can truly reﬂect their intrinsic
correlation with the target to be predicted; (3) introduce or develop a
powerful algorithm (or engine) to operate the prediction; (4) properly
perform cross—validation tests to objectively evaluate the anticipated
accuracy of the predictor and (5) establish a user—friendly web—server
for the predictor that is accessible to the public. Below, we are to
describe how to deal with these steps one—by—one.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Benchmark dataset

The benchmark dataset was constructed based on the chromatin
state information of nine cell lines, including H1ES, K562,
GM12878, HepG2, HUVEC, HSMM, NHLF, NHEK and HMEC.
The chromatin state information was annotated by ChromHMM
(Ernst and Kellis, 2012; Ernst et 61]., 2011) with the whole genome
profile of multiple histone marks, such as H3K4me1, H3K4me3,
H3K27ac, etc.

As pointed out by a comprehensive review (Chou and Shen,
2007a), there is no need to separate a benchmark dataset into a train—
ing dataset and a testing dataset for validating a prediction method if
it is examined by the jackknife test or subsampling (K—fold) cross val—
idation because the outcome thus obtained is actually from a combin—
ation of many different independent dataset tests. Thus, the
benchmark dataset set S for this study can be formulated as

{ S 2 8+ U 8— (1)
8+ : Ssiirong U S:rsreak

where ST is the set that contains non—enhancers only, U is the symbol
for union in the set theory, ST is the set containing enhancers only,
Sirong is the subset containing the strong enhancers only and Sjveak is
the subset containing the weak enhancers only. The strong

tated in all the nine tissues mentioned above, but the weak enhan—

and the non—enhancers in ST are clearly anno-

cers in Sjveak vary significantly with different tissues. To cope with
this kind of situation, the weak enhancers were constructed based
on the human embryonic stem cell.

All the samples obtained via the above procedure were divided
into 200 bp fragments in order to be consistent with the length of
nucleosome and linker DNA. All those samples with length <200 bp
were removed. Thus, we obtained 742 strong enhancers, 370517
weak enhancers, and 5 257 994 non—enhancers. To get rid of redun—
dancy and avoid bias, the CD—HIT software (Li and Godzik, 2006)
was used by setting the cutoff threshold at 80% to remove those
DNA fragments with high sequence similarity (note that the most
stringent cutoff threshold for DNA sequences allowed by CD—HIT
was 75%). The numbers of weak enhancers and non—enhancers are
much larger than that of strong enhancers. To get a benchmark
dataset with balanced subsets in size, we randomly picked 742 sam-
ples from the weak enhancers and 1484 samples from the non-en-
hancers. The final benchmark dataset S thus obtained contains 2968
samples, of which 742 are strong enhancers belonging to Sstrong, 742

weak enhancers belonging to ST and 1484 non-enhancers

weak’
belonging to ST (cf. Equation 1). The sequences of the 2968 sam—
ples classified into three subsets are given in Supplementary

Information 81.

2.2 Pseudo k—tuple nucleotide composition (PseKNC)
Suppose a DNA sample D with L nucleotides; i.e.

D=N1N2N3"‘Ni"‘NL (2)

where N1 represents the first nucleotide at the sample sequence pos—
ition 1, N2 the second nucleotide at the position 2, and so forth.
They can be any of the four nucleotides; i.e.

NiE {A(adenine) C(cytosine) G(guanine) T(thymine)} (3)

If the DNA sequence sample is represented by the k—tuple nucleo—
tide (or k—mers) composition (Ioshikhes et al., 1996), the corres—
ponding feature vector will contain 4/2 components, as given by

D=m f2 f3  f.-  f4k 1T. <4)

where the symbol T is the transpose operator,  represents the nor—
malized occurrence frequency of the ith k—mer. As we can see from
Equation (4), with the incensement of k values, although longer—
range information can be incorporated, the vector’s dimension will
increase rapidly. As we can see from Equation (4), when k > 4, the
number of the vector components will rapidly increase, causing the
so—called ‘high—dimension disaster’ (Wang et al., 2008) or overfitting
problem that will significantly reduce the deviation tolerance or
cluster—tolerant capacity (Chou, 1999) so as to lower down the pre—
diction success rate or stability. Therefore, the k—mers approach is
useful only when the value of k is very small. In other words, it can
only be used to incorporate the local or short—range sequence—order
information, but certainly not the global or long—range sequence—
order information. To approximately cover the long—range se—
quence—order effects, one popular and well—known method is to use
the pseudo components that were originally introduced in dealing
with protein/peptide sequences (Chou, 2001, 2005) and recently ex—
tended to deal with DNA/RNA sequences (Chen et al., 2014a, b, c,
2015a, b; Liu et al., 2015a, b, c).

According to the concept of pseudo components, the DNA
sample of Equation (2) can be formulated by the vector called

pseudo k—tuple nucleotide composition of PseKNC (Chen et al.,
2014a);i.e.

D:[d1 d2  d4/a d4k+1  d4k+xllT (5)

where

fu
% (
2:1]? + “12,/"L461
w0u_4k

2:1]? + “12,/"L461

In Equation (6), the definition of fu (u = 1, 2, . , 4k) is the
same as the components in Equation (4), meaning the normalized

(4k<ug4k+/l)

occurrence frequency of the nth non-overlapping k-mer in the DNA
sequence, and

where 01 is called the first—tier correlation factor that reﬂects the se—
quence—order correlation between all the most contiguous dinucleo—
tide along a DNA sequence (Fig. 2a), 02, the second—tier correlation
factor between all the second most contiguous dinucleotide
(Fig. 2b); 03, the third—tier correlation factor between all the third
most contiguous dinucleotide (Fig. 2c); and so forth. Ci7i+i denotes
the coupling factor of the ith dinucleotide with the (i —I— j)th one
along a DNA sequence, and its detailed definition is given by

where ,u is the number of DNA physicochemical properties con—
sidered that is equal to 6 in this study and will be further explained
bellow.

Now, it is clear that the first 4k components in Equation (5) are
used to incorporate the short—range or local sequence—order informa-
tion of the DNA sequence, while the remaining components used for
its long—range or global sequence order information. Obviously, 2
can also be viewed as the number of the total pseudo components
used to reﬂect the long—range or global sequence effect (Liu et al.,

2005). The concrete values for 2 and w will be further discussed
later.

2.3 DNA local structural property parameters

Many reports indicate that DNA physicochemical properties play
important roles in gene expression regulation (Brukner et al., 1995 ;
Fukue et al., 2005; Gowers and Halford, 2003), and that they are
also useful for conducting genome analysis (Miele et al., 2008).
Actually, being evolutionarily more constrained than the underlying
actual sequence, they are also closely correlated with the functional
non—coding elements such as enhancers (Parker et al., 2009).
Accordingly, it is reasonable to use the physicochemical properties
of nucleotides to define the coupling factors of Equation (8).

According to Dickerson (1989), the spatial arrangements of two
neighboring base pairs are usually characterized by six parameters,
of which three are local translational parameters (shift, slide and
rise) and other three are the local angular parameters (twist, tilt and
roll).

The detailed values for the six DNA local parameters are
given in Table 82-1 of Supplementary Information SZ, which
were used to calculate the coupling factors of Equation (8) to reflect
global or long—range sequence pattern information for the DNA se—
quences concerned. Note that before substituting these parameters
into Equation (8), all the original values Pg(D,-) (i : 1, 2,

3,  , 6) were subjected to a standard conversion, as described
by
P (Dz) —P (Di)
P D,- <2 ¥, (9)
g( ) SD{<Pg<D.->>}

where the symbol ( ) means taking the average of the quantity
therein over the 42 = 16 different dinucleotides, and SD means the
corresponding standard deviation. For the detailed mathematical
formulation of SD, see Equation (4) of Chou (2001) or Equation (4)
of Chou (2005 ). The advantage to do so is that the converted values
obtained by Equation (9) will have a zero mean value over the 16
different dinucleotides, and will remain unchanged if going through
the same conversion procedure again (Chou and Shen, 2007b).
Listed in Table 82—2 of Supplementary Information SZ are the cor—
responding values obtained via the standard conversion of Equation
(9) from the data in Table 82—1 of Supplementary Information 82.

Thus, any DNA sequence can be uniquely defined by a feature
vector of Equation (5 ), where the short—range or local sequence pat—
tern can be reﬂected by the 4k k—tuple nucleotides, while the long—
range or global sequence correlation can be reﬂected by the 2 pseudo
components as given by Equations (6—8.).

2.4 Support vector machine

Being widely used in the realm of bioinformatics (see, e.g. Chen
et al., 2015c; Liu et al., 2015e, f; Qiu et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2015;
Xu et al., 2015), SVM is a machine—learning algorithm based on the
statistical learning theory (Cortes and Vapnik, 1995). An SVM
training algorithm builds a non-probabilistic binary linear classifier
to assign new samples into one of the two categories. In an SVM
model, the samples are mapped to points in space, where the separ—
ate categories are divided by a clear wide gap. New samples are then
mapped into that same space and their categories are predicted ac—
cording to which side of the gap they fall on. In addition to linear
classification, SVMs can efficiently perform a non-linear classifica-
tion by using the so—called kernel trick, implicitly mapping the in-
puts into high—dimensional feature spaces.

In this study, we used the functions provided in LIBSVM (Chang
and Lin, 2009), a library for SVM classification and regression. The
RBF kernel function contains two parameters C and y , which will
be optimized for the benchmark dataset via the grid search tool pro—
vided in LIBSVM (Chang and Lin, 2011), as will be further dis-
cussed later.

For a brief formulation of SVM and how it works, see Cai et al.
(2003), Chou and Cai (2002); for more details about SVM, see a
monograph (Cristianini and Shawe—Taylor, 2000).

2.5 Two—layer classification framework

To make the prediction method not only able to identify whether a
DNA sample is an enhancer but also make it able to identify the
strength type, here we are to develop a two—layer predictor similar
to the treatment in identifying membrane proteins and their types
(Chou and Shen, 2007a,b).

The first—layer predictor was trained and tested by the bench—
mark dataset in the first equation of Equation (1); while the second—
layer predictor was trained and tested by its second equation.

Both the two predictors were operated with the SVM
algorithm as described in the last section. But their parameters
(a, 2 and w were optimized separately, as will be further discussed
later.

The two—layer predictor thus obtained is called Enhancer-2L. To
provide an intuitive view, a ﬂowchart to show the process of how
the 2—layer classifier works is given in Figure 3.

2.6 Performance metrics and cross validation

To more completely and objectively evaluate the quality of a pre—
dictor, one needs to consider two things. One is the metrics used to
quantitatively measure its performance, and the other is the test
method adopted during the cross validation.

The predictions performed by both the layers in Enhancer-2L are
actually in dealing with a binary (two—lass) classification problem.
Its first layer is to address whether a query DNA sample belonging
to an enhancer or non—enhancer. If it is the former, the prediction
will be automatically continued by its second layer to find out where
the enhancer is of the strong type or weak one. For this kind of

where TP represents the true positive; TN, the true negative; FP, the
false positive; FN, the false negative; Sn, the sensitivity; Sp, the spe—
cificity; Acc, the accuracy; MCC, the Mathew’s correlation coeffi—
cient (Chen et al., 2007). But the metrics formulated in Equation
(10) is not easy—to—understand for most experimental scientists, and
hence here we would prefer to use the following formulation as
done by many investigators in a series of recent publications (see,
e.g. Chen et al., 2012, 2013; Guo et al., 2014; Jia et al., 2015b; Lin
et al., 2014; Qiu et al., 2014, 2015; Xiao et al., 2015; Xu et al.,

where NJr is the total number of the positive samples or enhancers
investigated while N; the number of enhancer samples incorrectly
predicted to be of non—enhancer; N _ the total number of the nega—
tive samples or non—enhancers investigated while N; the number of
the non—enhancers incorrectly predicted to be of enhancer.

Based on Equation (11), the following are evident. When N;
: 0 meaning none of the enhancers was incorrectly predicted be—
longing to non—enhancers, we have the sensitivity Sn : 1. When N;
: N + meaning that all the enhancers were incorrectly predicted be—
longing to non—enhancers, we have the sensitivity Sn : 0. Similarly,
when N; : 0 meaning none of the non—enhancers was mispredicted,
we have the specificity Sp : 1; whereas N; :N_ meaning that all
the non—enhancers were incorrectly predicted as enhancers, we have
the specificity Sp : 0. When N; = N; = 0 meaning that none of
enhancers in the positive dataset and none of the non—enhancers in
the negative dataset were incorrectly predicted, we have the overall
accuracy Acc : 1 and MCC : 1; when N; : N+ and N; 2N—
meaning that all the enhancers in the positive dataset and all the
non-enhancers in the negative dataset were incorrectly predicted, we
have the overall accuracy Acc : 0 and MCC : —1; whereas when
N; : N+/2 and N; :N_/2 we have Acc : 0.5 and MCC : 0
meaning no better than random guess. As we can see from the above
discussion, it would make the meanings of sensitivity, specificity,
overall accuracy, and Mathew’s correlation coefficient much more
intuitive and easier—to—understand by using the metrics formulated
in Equation (11) instead of Equation (10), particularly for the mean—
ing of MCC.

Note that, however, the set of metrics in Equation (11) is valid
only for the single—label systems. For the multi—label systems whose
emergence has become more frequent in system biology (Chou et al.,
2012; Lin et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2011) and sys—
tem medicine (Xiao et al., 2013), a completely different set of met—
rics is needed as elaborated in Chou (2013).

With the performance metrics well defined, now let us consider
the test methods. In statistical prediction, the following three cross—
validation methods are often used to calculate the metrics values for
a predictor: independent dataset test, subsampling (or K—fold cross—
validation) test and jackknife test (Chou and Zhang, 1995 ). Of the
three methods, however, the jackknife test is deemed the least arbi—
trary that can always yield a unique outcome for a given benchmark
dataset as elucidated in Chou (2011) and demonstrated by
Equations (28)—(32) therein. Therefore, the jackknife test has been
widely recognized and increasingly used by investigators to examine
the quality of various predictors (see, e.g. Dehzangi et al., 2015;
Hajisharifi et al., 2014; Khan et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015; Liu
et al., 2015a; Mondal and Pai, 2014; Zhou and Assa—Munt, 2001).

Accordingly, in this study we also use the jackknife test to evalu—
ate the accuracy of the current predictor. During the jackknife test,
each of the samples in the benchmark dataset is in turn singled out
as an independent test sample and all the rule—parameters are calcu—
lated without including the sample being identified. Although the
jackknife test may take more computational time, it is worthwhile
because it will always yield a unique outcome for a given benchmark
dataset.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Parameter optimization

As we can see from Equations (5—7), the present model depends on
the three parameters (a, w and 2, where [2 reﬂects the local or short—
range sequence—order effect, w is the weight factor usually within
the range from 0 to 1 and 2 is the number of correlation tiers con—
sidered to reﬂect the global sequence pattern effect (Fig. 2).
In general, the greater the k or 2 is, the more local or global se—
quence—order information the model will contain; but if k or 2 is too
large, it may cause the high—dimension problem, reducing the clus—
ter—tolerant capacity (Chou, 1999) so as to lower down the cross—
validation accuracy due to over—fitting or ‘high dimension disaster’
problem (Wang et al., 2008). Therefore, our searching for the opti—

It can be seen from the above equation that to optimize the val—

= 2200 different cases for each of the two layers in iEnhancer-ZL.
To reduce the computational time, we used the 5—fold cross—valid—

ation to determine the optimal parameters, and the results thus ob—
tained for the two layers of iEnhancer-ZL are

k = 6 for both 1st and 2nd layers
2 = 9 for both 1st and 2nd layers

w = 0.1 for the 1st layer (13)

w = 0.4 for the 2nd layer

3.2 The performance in identifying enhancers and
classifying their strength types
Subsequently, the parameter values in Equation (13) are used to con—
duct the rigorous jackknife tests on the iEnhancer-ZL predictor for
calculating the Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC as defined in Equation (11).
The results thus obtained are given in Table 1, from which we can
see that the overall accuracy (Acc) by the first layer of iEnhancer-ZL
is ~77% with MCC being 0.54. Although these rates are only
slightly better than the corresponding jackknife rates obtained by
gkm—SVM (Ghandi et al., 2014) and kmer (Ioshikhes et al., 1996)
on the same benchmark dataset used in this study, the success rates
(see the third row of Table 1) achieved by the second layer of
iEnhancer-ZL in identifying the types of enhancers is beyond the
reach of gkm—SVM (Ghandi et al., 2014) and kmer (Ioshikhes et al.,
1996). To the best of our knowledge, iEnhancer-ZL is so far the first
computational predictor ever established for being able to identify—
ing not only the enhances but also their types in strength.

As pointed out in Chou (2015 ), the availability of web—server for
a prediction method will make it much more convenient to users.
Unfortunately, neither kmer (Ioshikhes et al., 1996) nor gkm—SVM
(Ghandi et al., 2014) had a web—server, and hence their practical
usage was limited. In contrast, the web—server for the new
iEnhancer-ZL is available, as detailed below.

3.3 Web—server and its user guide

For the convenience of users, particularly for the vast majority of ex—
perimental scientists, a publicly accessible web—server for iEnhancer—ZL
has been established. Moreover, to maximize users’ convenience, given
below is a step—by—step guide on how to use it to get the desired results
without the need to go through the above mathematical details.

Step 1: Open the web—server by clicking the link at http://bioinfor-
matics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer—2L/ and you will see the top page of
iEnhancer-ZL as shown in Figure 4. Click on the Readme button to
see a brief introduction about the server.

Step 2: You can either type or copy and paste the query sequences
into the input box at the center of Figure 4, or directly upload your in—
put data by the Browse button. The input sequence should be in the
FASTA format. A potential sequence in FASTA format consists of a
single initial line beginning with the symbol, >, in the first column, fol-
lowed by lines of sequence data in which nucleotides are represented
using single—letter codes. Except for the mandatory symbol >, all the
other characters in the single initial line are optional and only used for
the purpose of identification and description. The sequence ends if an—
other line starting with the symbol > appears; this indicates the start of
another sequence. Example sequences in FASTA format can be seen by
clicking on the Example button right above the input box.

Step 3: Click on the Submit button to see the predicted results.
The predicted results will be shown on the screen. For example, if

Fig. 4. A semi-screenshot to show the top page of the web-server iEnhancer-
2L. Its web-site address is http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer-2L/

using the query sequences in the Example window, you will see the
following on the screen: (1) the first query sequence contains nine
strong enhancers: sub—sequences 1—200, 2—201, 3—202, 4—203,
5—204, 6—205, 7—206, 8—207 and 9—208; (2) the second query
sequence contains one weak enhancer at sub—sequence 1—200; (3)
the third query sequence contains one weak enhancer at sub—se—
quence 1—200; (4) the fourth query sequence contains no enhancer;
(5 ) the fifth query sequence contains no enhancer. All these pre—
dicted results are fully consistent with experimental observations.

Step 4: You can also download the predicted results into a file by
clicking the Download button on the aforementioned screen.

4 Conclusion

It is a big challenge to identify the enhancers from enormous amount
of DNA sequences generated in the postgenomic era. One of the
keys to develop a sequence—based predictor is how to effectively for—
mulate the sequence samples concerned. Inspired by the successes of
introducing the pseudo amino acid composition or PseAAC to for—
mulate protein/peptide samples (Chou 2001, 2005 ), in the currently
proposed iEnhancer-ZL predictor, we have used the pseudo le-tuple
nucleotide composition or PseKNC to formulate DNA samples, in
which the local sequence patterns of DNA samples are reflected by
the le—mer composition, while their global sequence patterns re—
ﬂected by the pseudo components (Liu et al., 2015f).

iEnhancer-ZL is a two-layer predictor. Its first layer is to identify
whether a query DNA element is of enhancer or not. If the outcome
is yes, then the second layer will automatically continue to identify
its strength: strong or weak. To the best of our knowledge, it is the
first predictor ever developed that can be also used to classify enhan—
cers according to their strength.

A user-friendly web server for iEnhancer-ZL has been established
at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/iEnhancer—2L/, by which users
can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through
the complicated mathematics involved, which were presented here
just for its integrity. It is also the first web—server ever established for
identification/classification of enhancers.

It is anticipated that iEnhancer-ZL may become a very useful
high throughput tool for studying enhancers or, at the very least,
play an important complementary role to the existing methods in
this area.

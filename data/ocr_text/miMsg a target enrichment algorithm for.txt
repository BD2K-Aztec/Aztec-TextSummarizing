ABSTRACT

Motivation: Algorithms predicting microRNA (miR)—mRNA interactions
generate high numbers of possible interactions, many of which might
be non-existent or irrelevant in a certain biological context. It is desir-
able to develop a transparent, user-friendly, unbiased tool to enrich
miR—mRNA predictions.

Results: The miMsg algorithm uses matched miR/mRNA expression
data to enrich miR—mRNA predictions. lt grades interactions by the
number, magnitude and signiﬁcance of misplacements in the com-
bined ranking profiles of miR/mRNA expression assessed over mul-
tiple biological samples. miMsg requires minimal user input and makes
no statistical assumptions. lt identified 921 out of 56 262 interactions
as top scoring and significant in an actual germ cell cancer dataset.
Twenty-eight miR—mRNA pairs were deemed of highest interest based
on ranking by miMsg and supported by current knowledge about
validated interactions and biological function. To conclude, miMsg is
an effective algorithm to reduce a high number of predicted inter-
actions to a small set of high confidence interactions for further study.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRs) are a subclass of a large group of non-
coding RNAs that play an important role in post-transcriptional
regulation of gene expression, crucially inﬂuencing development
and physiology (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009; He and
Hannon, 2004; Mallory and Vaucheret, 2006; Pauli et al.,
2011; Taft et al., 2010). In addition, miRs also contribute to
initiation and progression of diseases, including cancer
(Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009; Esquela—Kerscher and Slack,
2006; Krol et al., 2010). Around 2000 miRs have been identiﬁed
in mammals so far [miRBase, (Grifﬁths-J ones et al., 2006)], each
possibly regulating (protein levels of) hundreds of different

mRNAs according to available prediction algorithms (Bartel,
2009). Much research has been done to elucidate the regulation
of mRNA levels by miRs. Initial results showed that in plants
mRNA degradation occurs by fully complementary binding of
miRs to open reading frames (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011).
In animals, miRs were hypothesized to predominantly repress
translation by binding of partially complementary sequences to
their target’s mRNAs 3’-untranslated region, hence not leading
to mRNA degradation (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009;
Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011; Sobkowiak et al., 2008;
Voinnet, 2009). However, mRNA degradation as a consequence
of miR binding has also been demonstrated in animals (Carthew
and Sontheimer, 2009; Eulalio et al., 2008; F ilipowicz et al., 2008;
Huang et al., 2007b; Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011; Lim et al.,
2005; Thomas et al., 2010; Wu and Belasco, 2008). In general,
induction of miR expression results in reduced levels of their
mRNA targets, while depletion of a speciﬁc miR will lead
higher target levels (Baek et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010;
Hendrickson et al., 2009; Selbach et al., 2008). Inactivation of
the miR processing pathway also leads to higher overall levels of
mRNA targets (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011; Schmitter
et al., 2006). Therefore, the current dogma acknowledges that
both translational repression and mRNA degradation are pre-
sent in plants and animals (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009;
Eulalio et al., 2008; Filipowicz et al., 2008; Huang et al.,
2007b; Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011; Lim et al., 2005;
Rajewsky, 2006; Thomas et al., 2010; Wu and Belasco, 2008).
These effects on mRNA levels are also detectable in gene expres-
sion data (Huntzinger and Izaurralde, 2011; Lim et al., 2005).
Degradation of mRNAs by miRs can be detected in high-
throughput expression data and can be successfully applied to
enrich the many possible interactions suggested by sequence-
based prediction algorithms (Barbato et al., 2009), e.g.
TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2003), Miranda (John et al., 2004) or
PicTar (Krek et al., 2005). In this article, a novel method
(miMsg) will be presented to enrich predicted miR—mRNA inter-
actions within a speciﬁc biological context. The algorithm uses
matched high-throughput miR and mRNA expression data of
biological samples. The miMsg algorithm is based on relative
ranking (RR) proﬁles of the expression data and does not
directly assess the absolute expression levels. Therefore, the al-
gorithm can be applied to detect small effects of miRs on

miMsg-miR target enrichment using expression data

 

mRNA, inferring power by detecting patterns over multiple bio-
logical samples. In recent literature, various other computational
methods have been applied to matched mRNA and miR expres-
sion data including regression, correlation analysis and Bayesian
learning algorithms [detailed comparison and review of previously
published related methods is provided in Supplementary data A
and (Barbato et al., 2009)]. In comparison, miMsg is independent
of the methods used to measure expression levels and the statis-
tical properties of the data. It also only needs a minimal number of
user-deﬁned parameters and has built-in quality control. Finally,
it yields a result that is directly related to the observed expression
patterns and also supplies a Visualization tool for individual inter-
actions. miMs g is extensively benchmarked against other methods
using 16 different (sub)sets of cancer-related expression data.
Benchmarking shows that non-parametric correlation methods
are inferior to the other algorithms tested. For the remaining al-
gorithms, results vary strongly depending on the dataset, and
overlap is minimal, identifying miMsg as a valuable alternative.
As a proof of principle, miMsg is applied to germ cell tumor
(GCT) data, investigating mRNA degradation, as most miR
have an inhibitory effect on mRNA/protein levels. In this deregu-
lated (cancer) context, miMsg identiﬁed validated relevant inter-
actions and miRs/mRNAs.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

2.1 Biological samples, expression proﬁling, data
normalization and statistics

The following matched GCT samples were included: ﬁve sper-
matocytic seminomas (SS, type III GCT), three seminomas (SE,
type II GCT) and three embryonal carcinomas (EC, type II
GCT) (Oosterhuis and Looijenga, 2005). mRNA expression
data (Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 Array) was acquired,
pre—processed and normalized as described in (Looijenga et al.,
2006). Matched miR expression data (multiplex qPCR, Applied
Biosystems) were acquired as described in Supplementary Data
M. Raw Ct values were normalized to RNU6b (results main text,
Supplementary Table S1) or their global average [(Mestdagh
et al., 2009), Supplementary Table S2, signiﬁcant overlap with
RNU6b-based normalization (30% overlap, P< 0.01 based on
simulation)]. Unless speciﬁed otherwise, a t-test was used to com-
pare groups (Excel 2010/Matlab 2012a).

2.2 Annotation and target prediction matching

mRNA target predictions were downloaded from TargetScan’s
Web site (conserved miR families). The most recent annotation
ﬁles for the Affymetrix GeneChip HG—Ul33-Plus2 were down-
loaded from the manufacturer’s website. Data were carefully
parsed to ﬁt the miMsg format (Supplementary Data B). miR
annotations were split and matched on miR family, class and
member separately to prevent missed matches. Gene symbols
were used to merge Affymetrix probe annotations with
TargetScan‘s predictions. Only predictions for humans were
included (speciele = 9606) and only probes marked as speciﬁc
for one transcript were selected (sufﬁx ‘_at’). In the end, 37 956
mRNA probes and 293 miRs were available for analysis. Of
these, 5919 mRNA probes and 148 miRs were predicted to inter-
act (inhibition, 56262 interactions, Table 1).

3 ALGORITHM

miMsg uses miRNA/mRNA expression and publicly available
databases with predicted interactions to enrich miR—mRNA
interactions within a speciﬁc biological context. The miMsg
algorithm is based on the dogma that low mRNA target levels
as a result of degradation are detectable in real targets of a spe-
ciﬁc miR and are absent in non-interacting predicted targets.
miMsg is preeminently applicable to miR—mRNA interactions
because the relevance of miR—mRNA interactions in a biologic-
ally coherent set of samples depends on how the samples inter-
relate (i.e. ranking) rather than individual expression levels. In an
ideal interaction proﬁle, high expression of a miR in a tissue
should be coupled with low mRNA expression. By observing
this over multiple tissues, miMsg creates a combined ranking
proﬁle of miR/mRNA expression for each interaction
(RR, Fig. 1).

The output of the miMsg algorithm is straightforward
and focuses on biological interpretation. It detects inter-
actions with similar or inverse RR depending on the predicted
functional relation. The algorithm computes only three scores
for each interaction. These are intuitively related to the observed
RR and describe the quality and signiﬁcance of the deviation
from the ideal interaction proﬁle. These scores are used to iden-
tify relevant and signiﬁcant patterns, which can be further
studied.

3.1 Deﬁnitions

As explained in Figure 1A, the miMsg algorithm uses two
matched sets of expression data: A and B. CC contains the
hypothesized interactions between A and B and their direction
(inhibition for miR—mRNA interactions). The RR of the expres-
sion levels is presented in RRJ- for each interaction j and used to
calculate the following quantities: (i) ej as an estimate for the
number of misplacements in RRJ- (Deﬁnition 1), (ii) oj as a
measure for the magnitude of these misplacements (Deﬁnition
2) and (iii) Qtj (effect size), which combines the ej and 0]-
(Deﬁnition 3). Also, associated levels of (empirically derived)
signiﬁcance and false discovery rate (FDR) are presented.
Next, these quantities are formally deﬁned (also see
Supplementary Data B—E).

Let n denote the total number of interactions between the two
datasets and m the total number of biological samples per inter-
action. Furthermore, let j=1,...,n denote the interaction and
i: I, . . ., m the biological sample.

DEFINITION l: e, (RELATIVE NUMBER OF MISPLACEMENTS). The rela-
tive number of misplacements ej is deﬁned as follows:

 

1h
- = 0 1
where ibj = 0,1, . . ., m-I denotes the number of misplacements in the

RR of interaction j involving m samples. A misplacement is deﬁned
as a diﬁ’erence between adjacent ranks being unequal to I, i.e.
ordering differs from ideal profile. (Supplementary Data D).

The relative number of misplacements alone is an incomplete
measure for how well the proﬁle in RRJ- correlates to the ideal
proﬁle. The magnitude of the difference between adjacent ranks
is important as well. Small differences between adjacent ranks

(small misplacements) are considered less serious than larger
ones (Fig. 1D). Therefore, consider the following measure for
the magnitude of the misplacements in RRj.

DEFINITION 2: a, (MAGNITUDE OF MISPLACEMENTS). The relative
magnitude of the misplacements 0], measured by its relative vari-
ance, is defined as follows:

a = Eli—11 lRRj.i+1 — RRM — 1|
J floor(m72)

 

e[01]

where RR),- denotes the ith biological sample in the jth interaction,
and floor( m2 /2 ) is the maximum obtainable variance in a RR con-
taining m biological samples.

To quantify the combined effect of the number and magni-
tude of the misplacements, a combined score (effect size) is
deﬁned.

DEFINITION 3: 7t, (COMBINED EFFECT SIZE). The number and mag-
nitude of misplacements (Definition 1, 2 ) are combined in Aj using
the following equation:

Aj=8j+oj—(ej-oj)e[0 1]

7» is a monotonically increasing function of e and a, which
approaches zero if and only if both 8 and o approach zero
(e:[0 1] and o:[0 1]). It is a measure for the combined
effect size of e and o and is used to easily rank selected inter-
actions. Low values of 7» indicate a better match to the ideal RR
(Fig. 1D).

Finally, a statistical test is required to show relevance and
statistical signiﬁcance of the scores.

3.1.1. Significance and relevance The ﬁnal steps of the algo-
rithm determine (i) which interaction patterns are statistically
unlikely to occur by chance and (ii) which values of 7» should
be considered relevant (2 sufﬁciently low) (Fig. 1C). These
independent steps will be discussed below.

3.1.1.1 Significance In the preceding computations, the abso-
lute values of e, o and 7» that result for each interaction may be
coincidental. Hence, a measure of statistical signiﬁcance is
required. As no a priori knowledge about the statistical proper-
ties of the data is present, an empirically derived 2D cumulative

distribution function (cdf) is generated to assess the probability
of coincidental (e, o) combinations. This cdf is iteratively
approximated using permuted (shufﬂed) versions of the original
expression data. After each iteration, the cdf is evaluated at all
possible combinations (8k, om) present in the real data,
k: 1,2, . . .,K and m=1,2,. ..,M. This yields a cdf ,o(e, a) that
can be compared between iterations at (e, o). The process of
adding (8, o) combinations from permuted data is repeated
until the difference between the current and previous iteration
is neglectable (i.e. <tol). This difference is deﬁned as the relative
root mean square error (rre):

 

215:1 2314:1(10X8k, 0m) — [Oi—1(8k) 0m))2
215:1 233:1 [012(8k, 0m)

 

rrei 2

After convergence, the resulting pdet(e, o) is evaluated at
all combinations from the real data (8k, am) to assess their re-
spective P-Values (Supplementary Data E). pdet(e, o) is uniquely
generated for each group of interactions with the same number
of unique biological samples, as this number deﬁnes the theor-
etical variability of e and o [i.e. the shape of pdet(e, 0)].
(Supplementary Data F for more information about repetitive
values.) Formally, an interaction is deemed signiﬁcant if the fol-
lowing holds.

DEFINITION 4: STATISTICAL SIGNIFICANCE. Consider the jth inter-
action, the corresponding measures ej and oj (Definition 1, 2 )
and a user-deﬁned level of significance 01. Moreover, consider the
cdf pdef(e,o) obtained using the procedure discussed in Section
3.1.1.]. Then, the jth interaction is deﬁned to be significant if

pdef(8:0) S at.

3.1.1.2 Relevance Apart from the signiﬁcance of an inter-
action pattern, it is required to determine which values of 7»
should be considered low enough (i.e. relevant). High values of
7» might still be statistically signiﬁcant, but do not constitute
relevant interaction patterns. By iteratively using permuted
expression data as input for miMsg, a cdf of 7» is generated,
denoted by ‘50») (analogous to 3.1.1.1). Using 1, the FDR for
all signiﬁcant values of 7» is determined. The researcher can
determine a maximal acceptable FDR (B, usually5 1%/ 5%).

3.2 Output

The ﬁnal output of miMsg is a table with all signiﬁcant inter-
actions and associated values of e, o and A as well as the
associated P-Values (example: Supplementary Table S1) and
F DRs. Also, an overview of the raw expression levels is supplied.
A detailed runﬁle with settings and properties of the input/
output is generated as well as a Visualization of the quality of
the results. An additional tool is supplied to Visualize individual
signiﬁcant interactions (example: Fig. 2; Supplementary
Data G).

 

Fig. 1. Flowchart of miMsg. (A) (User-deﬁned parameters) a, the desired
level of signiﬁcance (usually a 5 0.05); umin, the minimal number of
unique samples required in an interaction to qualify for analysis
(11ng 3); tol, the accepted variation at convergence of the empirically
derived cdf of (8,o)/A (default: 5 104). The following steps are executed:
(1) Deﬁne two sets of measurements: A and B. Columns represent
matched biological samples and rows contain measurements for miRs
(A) or mRNAs (B). (2) A and B are linked using table CC containing
predicted miR—mRNA interactions. This results in sets AV and BV. (3)
Using AV and BV, the RR for each interaction is calculated. This process
is depicted graphically in Figure 1B. (4) Using RR, the measures 8, o and
A (Deﬁnition 1—3) are calculated, describing the deviation of RR from the
ideal interaction proﬁle for each interaction. (5) An empirical 2D cdf for
(8,0) is computed using iterative permuted versions of AV and BV (AVp
and BVp, gray area). This cdf is then used to derive the signiﬁcance of the
scores for each interaction. (6) A, the associated level of signiﬁcance and
the FDR (Deﬁnition 3—5) are used to identify biologically relevant and
signiﬁcant interactions. (Asterisk)An empirically derived cdf of A is gen-
erated by permuting A and B. Using this cdf, the FDR of A is calculated
for all signiﬁcant interactions to determine which values of A are sufﬁ-
ciently low and thus represent relevant interaction proﬁles. (B) Example
of the calculation of RR. Five tissues (Tl—T5) are analyzed for a single
interaction j (hypothesis 2 inhibition). Values in (A) and (B) are equal to
their rank x 100. AVj/ij are sorted according to BVj. The ranks of AVj in
this sorted set constitute RRj and are used to compute ej, oj and Aj:
III]: {3-2: 1; 4-3 =1;1-47£1;5-17£1}=2, 8j=2/(5-1) 20.5; oj = (|3-2-1
|+| 4-3-1 |+| 1-4-1 |+| 5-1-1|)/ceil(52/2)=7/13, Aj=0.5+7/13-[0.5*(7/
13)] 20.8 (Supplementary Data B—G). (C) Graphical representation of
the selection of interaction patterns that are both signiﬁcant and relevant

50 = 0.22 —> Ablackz 0.3616. This illustrates deﬁnitions 2 and 3: larger
displacements are penalized more severely. It also shows that miMsg is
tailored to detect linear patterns with multiple ‘line segments’, only pena-
lizing discontinuities at their boundaries. Non-parametric correlation
methods (Spearman and Kendall) identify the whole discontinuity as a
disturbance of the overall pattern and repeatedly penalize all ranks
involved (Supplementary Data L). Because groups of biological samples
can behave differently but still correlate well per group, this leads to
underappreciated patterns

4 APPLICATION AND BENCHAMARKING

A selection of histologically diverse GCTs was analyzed to illus-
trate the applicability and functionality of miMsg. Firstly, the
performance of miMsg was studied by assessing the response to
permuted or random data. Secondly, a selection of top-scoring
and highly signiﬁcant interactions was further investigated.
Finally, extensive benchmarking was done including 16
datasets/subsets and 5 different algorithms for the selection of
miR—mRNA interactions.

4.1 GCT data

4 .1 .1 Response to permuted/random data and noise To assess the
robustness of the miMsg algorithm and the relevance of the pat-
terns detected, various tests with random permuted and modiﬁed
tests were run. When compared with 800 runs with permuted or
random expression data, miMsg identiﬁed signiﬁcantly more and
better scoring interactions in the real biologically relevant data
(P<0.01). This suggests detection of relevant patterns in biolo-
gical data (Supplementary Data H). Replacement of a fraction of
the predicted interactions with random interactions did not
prevent miMsg from identifying the originally top-scoring inter-
actions. Moreover, random or targeted reduction of the dataset
did not change miMsg’s identiﬁcation and grading of originally
selected interactions. This shows that miMsg is relatively insensi-
tive to (introduced) noise and the number of predicted targets
(Supplementary Data I).

4.1.2 Detection, selection and verification of interactions High
quality of the RRs was identiﬁed by both a low P—Value (signiﬁ-
cant) and a low value of A (relevant proﬁle, Fig. 2). A selection of
6093 signiﬁcant interactions was identiﬁed from the original pool
of 56 262 predicted interactions (Supplementary Table S1). Top-
scoring sets with 1% / 5% FDR and a top-100 (FDR 0.1%) were
deﬁned based on the accumulated data of 400 runs with per-
muted expression data (Table 1). These top-scoring and highly
signiﬁcant subsets were matched with miRTarBase to identify
experimentally validated interactions. miRTarBase is a litera-
ture-based database of 3969 experimentally validated inter-
actions between 625 miRs and 2433 genes in 14 species
(version: April 15, 2011) (Hsu et al., 2011). Only human inter-
actions were included (n = 2817). The fraction of validated inter-
actions in all predicted interactions was relatively small as most
of the predicted miR—mRNA interactions used as input are not
yet experimentally validated. However, enrichment of validated
interactions (%) in the selected subset was of interest as a quality
measure (rather than the a priori % of validated interactions).
Still, enrichment might not be present because interactions
validated in non-GCT systems are not necessarily active in
GCTs. However, from all algorithms tested in the benchmarking,
miMsg showed the highest enrichment for validated inter-
actions in the GCT dataset (37%, Supplementary Data L:
Supplementary Fig. S22).

4.2 Benchmarking

miMsg was compared with existing algorithms for miR—mRNA
interaction analysis using common non-parametric correlation
methods (Spearman and Kendall), a method using Bayesian
learning [GenmiR++ (Huang et al., 2007a,b)] and a LASSO—
based regression algorithm (Lu et al., 2011) (Supplementary
Data A). Twelve dataset/subsets were investigated. Three were
obtained from the original LASSO publication: Madison (naso-
pharyngeal cancer), Broad (various types and normal tissues,
also used in the GenmiR publication) and MSKCC (prostate
cancer). The other datasets included parallel miR—mRNA data
from different genetic subtypes of multiple myeloma [MM;
(Gutierrez et al., 2010)] and our primary GCT dataset. Several
subsets of the GCT and MM sets were analyzed. To start with,
random subsets of interactions were constructed that were com-
parable with the (LASSO) datasets from (Lu et al., 2011) with
regard to the number of (validated) interactions. Also, biologic-
ally coherent subsets were created including only validated inter-
actions or only genes differentially expressed between tumor
types [analogous to (Lu et al., 2011)].

Algorithms were benchmarked based on several criteria
(Table 2, Fig. 3). For all algorithms, highly variable performance
and little overlap between results were observed between data-
sets. Overall, common non—parametric correlation methods
(Spearman/Kendall) are clearly outperformed by miMsg,
LASSO and GenmiR (also see Fig. 1D). Between miMsg,
LASSO and GenmiR there is no obvious best choice.
Although we favor miMsg because of the limited number of
interactions selected and the unbiased distribution-free ap-
proach, application of different algorithms can aid the selection
of relevant interactions. (Table 2, Fig. 3, Benchmarking in detail:

Motivation: Selection of a high fraction (= high number) of interactions is not feasible when applying the
results to research. In addition, if validated interactions are active in the studied tissues, there should be a
higher fraction of validated interactions in the selected interactions as compared with the complete dataset.

Result: Different algorithms select constant fractions from almost all datasets. LASSO selects ca. 50% of all
interactions; the other algorithms select %5%. Enrichment for validated interactions varies greatly between
datasets with no clear trend toward one optimal algorithm (correlation 2 worst). In the large datasets (GCT
and MM), miMsg outperforms the other algorithms by achieving 37% and 33% enrichment for validated
interactions (or 5 0.05, FDR 5 0.05).

Motivation: Unperrnuted data in general should perform better than random data. Also, validated inter-
actions should outperform permuted data (ROC analysis).

Result: The total set of (validated) interactions most likely contains a high number of not interacting miR—
mRNA pairs/validated interactions that are not active. These are not expected to perform better than
random data. For most datasets, the algorithms therefore have difﬁculty outperforming permuted data
when considering all (validated) interactions. GenmiR performs well on some datasets followed by
miMsg; correlation analyses show the worst overall performance. When only the selected interactions are
considered LASSO, miMsg and to a lesser extend GenmiR perform much better in assigning higher scores to
unpermuted data and validated interactions.

Motivation: Algorithms using different approaches, but identifying many of the same interactions might be
more trustworthy.

Results: There is limited overlap between the interactions selected by the various algorithms even when only
good scoring interactions (top-100 or less) are considered. Spearman and Kendall overlap ca. 100% because
of high similarity in methodology.

Motivation: The size of the dataset and the fraction of validated interactions might inﬂuence performance of
the algorithms.

Results: For all algorithms, performance does not consistently improve when using smaller random subsets
with a higher fraction of validated interactions.

Motivation: Pre-selection of relevant interactions based on (gene) expression/validated interactions might
inﬂuence performance of the algorithms.

Results: For all algorithms, performance does not consistently improve when using pre-selected/validated
only sets of interactions.

5 DISCUSSION

miRs simultaneously, independent of miR/mRNA interaction.
Multiple samples per cluster are required to reduce this non-spe-

5.1 miMsg: considerations (input and application)

Predicted interactions. A sensible trusted set of predicted inter-
actions is a requirement to generate biological relevant output
when using miMsg. Supplementary Data H illustrates the effect
of random non-sense interactions. Inverse expression patterns
may occur by coincidence in expression data, which is not
permuted/randomized. miMsg might still identify top-scoring
signiﬁcant interactions in these experiments. This effect dis-
appears when expression data is permutated/randomized.
Biological samples. miMsg generates optimal results when
using biological samples that are clearly related to the studied
hypothesis and include multiple comparable as well as clinically/
biologically diverse samples in roughly equally sized groups.
More samples indicate a lower probability of coincidental
RRs. Moreover, rankings become more sensible when the sam-
ples differ biologically/clinically (Fig. 2A). However, clustering
on biological/histological subtype may occur for many genes/

ciﬁc effect.

Expression data. Adequate measurement precision of the data
is of particular importance, as miMsg relies heavily on ranking.
Samples with identical expression levels for certain miRs/
mRNAs due to rounding off will be excluded in the analysis of
interactions involving these miRs/mRNAs (Supplementary Data
F). On the other hand, precision outside of the detection meth-
od’s sensitivity/thresholds will not contribute to better results in
miMsg.

Scope of the study, limitations and future plans. In this article,
miMsg is applied to mRNA inhibition by miRs. Although there
is strong evidence that miRs inﬂuence mRNA levels, the com-
bined effect of mRNA inhibition and translational repression
without inﬂuencing mRNA levels (Huntzinger and Izaurralde,
2011) will not be detected by miMsg. Moreover, miMsg is
applied to cancer-related datasets. Cancer is a deregulated state
in which interactions might be detected easily. Theoretically

Fig. 3. Overlap between interactions selected by the various algorithms
(GCT: 56262 interactions). Maximum total overlap between ﬁve algo-
rithms is (5—1) x 100% = 400% (inner ticks). Outer ticks identify the % of
this maximal overlap that is realized for a speciﬁc algorithm/dataset. The
width of the ribbon identiﬁes the overlap between two algorithms as a %
of the number of selected interactions by each algorithm separately.
Algorithm labels ‘name—total number of selected interactions—% of
all interactions selected’. (Example of interpretation) Overall, miMsg
shows N25% overlap with all other methods. Consider the ribbon from
miMsg to LASSO: Of the 3473 interactions selected by miMsg, 54%
overlaps with the selection of the LASSO algorithm. On the hand,
this overlap with miMsg constitutes only 7.5% of the 25 337 interactions
selected by LASSO. Figure generated using Circos (Krzywinski et al.,
2009)

miMsg is also applicable to other datasets/directions (non-
cancer, other than miR/mRNA interactions, stimulation).
miMsg might also be used to create a reference database of
miR—mRNA interaction signatures in different tissues/cells.
These applications need to be investigated further.

5.2 Preliminary assessment of GCT results

miMsg was applied to expression data from a deﬁned set of
human GCTs. They represent the so—called type II (SE and
EC) and type III (SS) subtypes. Despite a good response to sys-
temic treatment, metastatic type II GCTs are a major cause of
death in young adults. Both SE and EC originate from primor-
dial germ cells / gonocytes. These cells have an intrinsic totipotent
capacity and mimic totipotent embryonic stem (ES) cells. Type
III GCTs originate from more differentiated germ cells and show
no embryonic features (Looijenga, 2009; Oosterhuis and
Looijenga, 2005). GCTs and their precursor lesions (either car-
cinoma in situ or gonadoblastoma) can be detected and classiﬁed
by speciﬁc immunohistochemical markers and show distinct pat-
terns /aberrations in DNA copy number and mRNA/miR expres-
sion (Gillis et al., 2007; Looijenga et al., 2006; Veltman et al.,
2005).

Based on a systematic literature review top-scoring (top-100)
and validated (FDR 5 5%) miRs/mRNAs associated with GCs/
GCTs were shown to be involved in (i) pluripotency/ germ line

development, (ii) TP53- and TFGB-mediated apoptosis +ther-
apy sensitivity, (iii) fetal development (iv) germ cell micro-envir-
onment, (V) proliferation and (Vi) carcinogenesis in general
(extended review and references presented in Supplementary
Data K).

Moreover, miR-23ab and miR-27ab were highly enriched in
the top-100 top-scoring subset (11: 19/100, Fig. 4). These miRs
are part of the miR-23 paralog clusters: miR23a/27a/24-2 (cluster
A, chromosome 19) and miR23b/27b/24-1 (cluster B, chromo-
some 9).

The miRs in these clusters are not necessarily regulated iden-
tically, but are thought to be closely related based on their evo-
lutionary conservation, sequence homology, genomic clustering
and simultaneous expression level changes in human diseases
including cancer (Chhabra et al., 2010; Tanzer and Stadler,
2004).

There was signiﬁcant differential expression of these miR
families, clusters and individual miRs between EC, SE and SS
(P< 0.05). The low expression in SE as compared with EC (both
type II GCTs) is interesting because these tumor types differ in
prognosis and biological behavior. Moreover, around half of the
19 top-scoring miR-23 paralog targets were shown to be targeted
by miRs in human ES cells (Lipchina et al., 2011)
(Supplementary Data K).

This overview does not imply proven functional relations, but
shows that miMsg can be successfully applied to identify relevant
targets for further study and validation in GCT-speciﬁc models.

6 CONCLUSION

To conclude, the miMsg algorithm is an unbiased tool to enrich
predicted miR—mRNA interactions for a speciﬁc biological con-
text using matched high-throughput miR/mRNA expression
data (Fig. 1). As interactions are graded on scores directly related
to combined ranking proﬁles of miR/mRNA expression, miMsg
is suitable to detect subtle miR—mRNA interactions (Fig. 2).
miMsg selected 0.18/1.64/6.17% (FDR 0.1/1/5%) highly relevant
and signiﬁcant interactions in the GCT data (Table 1, Fig. 4). In
the largest datasets (GCT/MM: 56 262/27 129 interactions),
miMsg outperforms the other algorithms by achieving 37/33%
enrichment for validated interactions. Overlap between inter-
actions selected by different algorithms is limited. Overall, the
benchmarking results illustrate that there is no obvious best
choice between miMsg, LASSO and GenmiR++. Spearman’s
and Kendall’s correlation methods perform worst. Results
depend strongly on the dataset used. Although we favor
miMsg because of its limited fraction of selected interactions
[85 versus ~50% (LASSO)] and unbiased distribution-free ap-
proach, application of different algorithms can aid selection of
relevant interactions.

A systematic literature review of the GCT results showed as-
sociation of top-scoring miRs/mRNAs with processes regulating
germ cells (proliferation/differentiation) and GCT development.
Moreover, interactions involving miR-23 paralogs were highly
enriched in the top-100. Fifty percent of the mRNAs involved
in these interactions were shown to be miR-binding in ES cells.
Based on (i) top-100 ranking by miMsg/FDR 5 1%, (ii) involve-
ment of the enriched miR-23 paralog cluster, (iii) known miR—
mRNA interaction and/or (iv) experimental validation, 28 high

(Krzywinski et al., 2009). Lines represent interactions between miRs and mRNAs. Black text/lines =miR-23ab/27ab cluster (top-100) or validated
interactions in top-scoring signiﬁcant interactions (FDR 5 1%). Gray text/lines 2 other miRs/mRNAs (top-100). Circles represent miRs (open circles)
and targets (mRNAs, closed circles). Larger circles indicate better scoring interactions. Depending on the local density of the plot and the available space,
the location of the circles cannot always exactly correspond to the genomic position of the miR/mRNA. Based on the known functions of the miRs/
mRNAs, four top-scoring interactions were identiﬁed as most important (PHFI7/miR—23a) PHFI7 promotes apoptosis, is a known renal tumor
suppressor and associates with OCT3/4 (Pardo et al., 2010), a key protein in germ cell cancer (Looijenga, 2009). Moreover, miR23a has been shown
to function as a tumor suppressor-miR via repression by c-Myc. (IRFI/miR—23b) [RF] is involved in the pathogenesis of infertility in men with germ cell
maturation arrest (validated in GCT cell line NT2) (Lian et al., 2010). Moreover, miR-23b is associated with the hormone regulated process of
spermiation in Sertoli cells (Nicholls et al., 2011). (IRSI/miR-7) IRS] is present in peritubular myoid and interstitial cells (Kokk et al., 2005),
which might suggest a role in the micro-environment of germ cells. miR-7 interferes with germ line differentiation in Drosophila (Pek et al., 2009).
(HIPK2/miR—27a) This interaction is validated in ovarian carcinoma cell lines when studying multidrug resistance (Li et al., 2010). miR-27a has also been
shown to inﬂuence oncogenesis, proliferation and differentiation in various forms of cancer Chhabra et al., 2010). This interaction was present twice in
the FDR5 1% top set

conﬁdence interactions were selected. Literature review identiﬁed
four of these as most relevant for further study (Fig. 4). To
conclude, miMsg was highly effective in reducing a high
number of predicted miR—mRNA interactions in GCT data,
generating a small high-conﬁdence set directly applicable to
further research.

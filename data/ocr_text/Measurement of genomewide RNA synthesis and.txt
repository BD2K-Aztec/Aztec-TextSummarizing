ABSTRACT

Summary: Standard transcriptomics measures total cellular RNA
levels. Our understanding of gene regulation would be greatly
improved if we could measure RNA synthesis and decay rates on a
genome-wide level. To that end, the Dynamic Transcriptome Analysis
(DTA) method has been developed. DTA combines metabolic RNA
labeling with standard transcriptomics to measure RNA synthesis
and decay rates in a precise and non-perturbing manner. Here, we
present the open source R/Bioconductor software package DTA. lt
implements all required bioinformatics steps that allow the accurate
absolute quantification and comparison of RNA turnover.

1 INTRODUCTION

Total RNA levels are a consequence of RNA synthesis and decay.
These individual contributions can be monitored by Dynamic
Transcriptome Analysis (DTA, Amorim et al., 2010, Friedel et al.,
2010, Miller et al., 2011). DTA requires culturing cells in the
presence of a labeling substrate (e.g. 4sU or 4tU). During a short,
non—perturbing RNA labeling pulse, cells incorporate 4tUTP into
newly transcribed RNA instead of uridine. This setup yields three
types of RNA fractions: total cellular RNA, newly transcribed
labeled RNA and pre—existing unlabeled RNA. The quantiﬁcation
of these fractions on microarrays or by RNA—seq is used to estimate
RNA synthesis and decay rates on a genome—wide scale, assuming
exponential decay. For each RNA g, the synthesis rate Mg and the
decay rate Ag are estimated from the equations

where t is the labeling duration, CCL the cell cycle length,
and Lg, Ug, Tg are the measurements of the labeled, unlabeled
and total RNA fractions, respectively. at can be set to 0 in the
case of primary cells (e.g. macrophages). It has been shown that
DTA has higher sensitivity and higher temporal resolution in
detecting gene regulatory changes than standard transcriptomics

(Miller et al., 2011). One of the technical obstacles of standard
transcriptomics is the unknown normalization factor between
samples, i.e. wild—type and mutant cells. Variations in RNA
extraction efﬁciencies and ampliﬁcation steps in the biochemical
protocol introduce differences in the global intensity levels. The
estimation of the normalization factors limits the precision of
DTA. We have extended DTA to comparative DTA (cDTA), to
eliminate this obstacle (Sun et al., 2011). cDTA allows for direct
comparison of RNA synthesis and decay rates between samples.
This is done by mixing an internal normalization standard of
Schizosaccharomyces pombe (Sp) cells to samples of wild—type or
perturbed Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Sc) cells. Here, we present the
R/Bioconductor package DTA. It implements all required methods
to estimate RNA synthesis and decay rates from pre—processed
microarray or RNA—Seq measurements of any organisms that are
obtained via the DTA or the cDTA protocol.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND AVAILABILITY

DTA is implemented in R (version 2 2.14, Ihaka et al., 1996) and
is part of Bioconductor (version 2 2.10, Gentleman et al., 2004).
To download and install DTA and all its dependencies refer to
http://bioconductor. org/packages/ 2. 10/bioc/html/DTA.html.

Other methods to infer RNA decay rates from gene expression
data have been published by Friedel et al. (2010) and Rabani et al.
(2010). So far, only Friedel et al. (2010) have provided a Java
implementation of their estimation procedure. The DTA package
is the ﬁrst to cover all aspects of the RNA labeling technique:
Bias correction, detailed visualization of quality control aspects and
proper handling of the results. It contains simulation methods and
functions for error estimation based on replicates and resampling.
Further it contains four example datasets for Yeast, Mouse and
Human (Doelken et al., 2008; Miller et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2011).

3 USAGE AND APPLICATION

DTA can be used for genome—wide synthesis and decay rate
estimation under all kinds of perturbations and for all kinds of
organisms. The rate extraction procedure can be easily accessed
via the core function DTA.estimate. Its input consists of a
matrix containing the normalized measurements of the total, labeled
and unlabeled RNA fractions (datama t) and a description of the
experimental design (phenoma t). For a more detailed explanation
of the required objects, we refer to the package vignette. In addition
to this, the number of uridines in each transcript is needed for

labeling bias assessment. This data is part of our package for a
number of model organisms such as yeast, drosophila, mouse and
human (Sc . tnumber etc.). Optionally, a vector of transcripts that
are considered valid for parameter estimation (reliable) can
be speciﬁed. We illustrate the functionality of DTA on a dataset
from (Sun et al., 2011), which compares an RNA Polymerase II
Sc point mutant with a reduced elongation rate to wild—type Sc. As
expected, synthesis rates are globally decreased, but surprisingly this
is compensated by a global reduction in decay rates (Fig. 1). The
R—objects required for this analysis are included in the DTA package.

The raw data is ﬁrst normalized, mapped to Yeast ORF IDs and
then the estimation procedure DTA. estimate generates a series
of quality control plots, if check = TRUE. These are absolutely
essential to check the reliability of the results. RStudio users should
consider the parameter RS tudio.

> Sc.datamat = DTA.map.it(cDTA.datamat,

> Pol = DTA.estimate(Pol.phenomat,Sc.datamat,
Sc.tnumber,Sc.ensg.reliable,ccl = 149.8,
LtoTratio = 0.05,check = FALSE)

Note that it is advisable to experimentally determine the median cell
cycle length (cc 1) of a sample if appropriate as a correction factor.
Additionally, the ratio of labeled to total mRN A can be passed to the
estimation procedure to yield the reported median wild—type mRNA
half—lives of (Miller et al., 2011). The same ratio is then used to
estimate the mRNA half—lives of the rpbl—N488D strain (Po 1). This
is reasonable as the data has been pre—processed via added Sp cells
(DTA . normal i ze). To yield Figure 1, just execute the following:

> r = Sc.ensg.reliable

> X = log2(Pol$"6"$"dr"[r]/Wt$"6"$"dr"[r])

> y = log2(Pol$"6"$"sr"[r]/Wt$"6"$"sr"[r])

4 CONCLUSION

The DTA package delivers straightforward methods to estimate RNA
synthesis and decay rates from pre—processed microarray or RNA—
Seq measurements that are obtained via the DTA/cDTA protocol.
The DTA package fulﬁlls the high standard of the Bioconductor
platform, regarding documentation and usability. It can therefore
be easily incorporated in R scripts for pre—processing and further
statistical analysis of the results can readily be carried out by other
methods within the R/Biocondactor programming environment.

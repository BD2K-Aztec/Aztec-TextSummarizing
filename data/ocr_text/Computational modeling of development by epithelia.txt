Abstract

Motivation: The transformation of the embryo during development requires complex gene net—
works, cell signaling and gene—regulated cell behaviors (division, adhesion, polarization, apoptosis,
contraction, extracellular matrix secretion, signal secretion and reception, etc.). There are several
models of development implementing these phenomena, but none considers at the same time the
very different bio—mechanical properties of epithelia, mesenchyme, extracellular matrix and their
interactions.

Results: Here, we present a new computational model and accompanying open—source software,
EmbryoMaker, that allows the user to simulate custom developmental processes by designing cus—
tom gene networks capable of regulating cell signaling and all animal basic cell behaviors. We also
include an editor to implement different initial conditions, mutations and experimental manipula—
tions. We show the applicability of the model by simulating several complex examples of animal
development.

Multi—scale computational models help in making the complexity of
development more amenable to the human mind. They may be con—
ceived as summaries of what is known about the development of an
organ or embryo part. Such summaries, however, should be built
upon explicit mechanistic hypotheses about how development
works in these systems. Computational models can then provide ex—
plicit quantitative predictions about how an embryo changes over
time according to each specific mechanistic hypothesis. These quan—
titative predictions (e.g. quantitative morphology as the position of
each cell in space and the levels of expression of different genes in

the rejection or provisional acceptance of a hypothesis (further ex—
periments would be required for actual acceptance of an
hypothesis).

There is a long list of models of pattern formation and morpho—
genesis involving cell—cell communication and biomechanics. Some
of them simulate the development of different organs, such as teeth
(Salazar—Ciudad 2008; Salazar—Ciudad and Jernvall 2010), limb
(Hentschel et al. 2004), turtle shell’s scutes (Moustakas—Verho et al.
2014), to cite a few. In other cases, processes involving the whole
embryo, such as gastrulation in the sea urchin, are reproduced

(Cummings 1990, 1994, 2005; Davidson et al. 1995). Others imple—
ment a framework of cell biomechanical interactions and gene regu—
lation, including one or several cell behaviors, namely cell division,
apoptosis and growth.

Some early models already identified the relevance of the com—
bination of cell signaling and morphogenetic movements by making
the local curvature of epithelial to depend on morphogen concentra—
tions (Cummings 1990, 1994, 2005).

The cellular Potts model (CPM) (Graner and Glazier 1992) de—
fines a regular lattice in which cells occupy several contiguous lat—
tice positions. Cells may extend to further lattice positions or
retract from them by minimizing a Hamiltonian energy function
based on cell adhesion, volume conservation and other mechanical
properties. The CPM is especially suitable for developmental sys—
tems in which cells change their neighbors and shape in rather dy—
namic ways (such as in cell sorting and migration by chemotaxis
and haptotaxis). However, tissues in which forces can be transmit—
ted along a specific direction at long distances, such as in epithelia,
may not be so easily grasped by the CPM. There are several models
based on CPM that implement several cell behaviors such as cell
division, cell migration (by chemotaxis), apoptosis and cell—cell
signaling (Hogeweg 2000; Izaguirre et al. 2004; Starrufﬁ et al.
2014)

In the vertex model (Honda et al. 2004), cells are defined by the
contact surfaces with other cells or the media. Each cell is a polygon
[or polyhedron in the three—dimensional (3D) case] defined by a set
of vertices and edges (and faces in the 3D case). Forces are calculated
based on overdamped motion equations or a Monte Carlo algo—
rithm. This model is suited to simulate dynamics of densely packed
tissues like epithelia but is not very well suited to simulate processes
involving mesenchymal tissues or processes in which cells move
freely in the extracellular space and seldom form tightly packed cell
condensates. In some cases, cell signaling and gene regulatory net—
works have been implemented as well (Farhadifar et al. 2007; Pitt—
Francis et al. 2009; Smith et al. 2012).

The viscoelastic model (or IBCell model) (Rejniak 2007) com—
bines an off—grid representation of cells as elastic bodies with a lat—
tice Boltzmann method to simulate intra and intercellular fluids.
Thus, each cell is represented by a set of points forming an elastic
body in a continuous two—dimensional space, but chemical sub—
stance concentration is calculated on a regular grid in discrete
space. Then the position of each cell part on this grid has to be
interpolated every time to correctly calculate how fluid fluxes in
the grid affect cell shape. This implementation and level of detail
make the model computationally very costly and thus precludes,
according to the authors (Tanaka et al. 2015), its extension to 3D
problems. Several cell behaviors have been implemented: cell pro—
liferation (Rejniak 2007), cell growth and cell—cell signaling
(Merks et al. 2011).

The subcellular element model (SEM) (Newman 2005;
Sandersius and Newman 2008) is an off—latice model in which cells
are made of groups of point elements that interact mechanically
based on a potential equation. Motion is computed with Langevin
overdamped dynamics. In some cases, cells are modeled with a sin—
gle subcellular element, thus approximating Drasdo’s spheroid
model (Delile et al. 2013; Drasdo et al. 2007). The original model
does not implement any cell behaviors apart from cell—cell adhesion,
but in a more recent implementation of the model (Delile et al.
2013), cell division, polarization, cell signaling, migration and some
basic gene networks are implemented.

Here, we present a new general multi—scale model of develop—
ment, the EmbryoMaker, that differs from previous models in a

fundamental way: the model recognizes that the bio—mechanical
properties of epithelia, extracellular matrix (ECM) and mesenchyme
are crucial to correctly understand many processes in early animal
development and in organogenesis. Other models are adequate for
either mesenchymal cells or flat epithelia but not for both or for
their interaction as it occurs in development (Biggs and Mikkola
2014)

The EmbryoMaker is based on the SEM for mesenchymal cells
but not for the epithelia and for the non—mechanical interactions.
Epithelial cells are instead assumed to be made of cylindrical subcel—
lular elements rather than spheres as cells in the SEM. In addition,
epithelial—specific rules are used to capture how epithelia interact
with mesenchyme and ECM and, in general, how they behave in
development.

In addition, our model implements the most complete set of basic
cell behaviors used by cells in animal development (cell growth and
division, cell death, cell migration, polarization, ECM secretion,
cell—cell adhesion, cell—cell signaling and epithelial to mesenchymal
transition). This is done by a unified set of rules acting on the cells’
subcellular elements. EmbryoMaker includes also a detailed imple—
mentation of cell’s molecular mechanisms involved in regulation
and cell—cell communication. This includes transcriptional and post—
transcriptional gene networks and signaling by the diffusion of gene
products in the extra—cellular space and the binding to their specific
receptors. A fundamental aspect of the model is that the gene prod—
ucts present in each subcellular element can regulate its mechanical
properties and activate or repress specific cell behaviors. This allows
an explicit multi—scale coupling between microscale regulatory mo—
lecular processes and macroscale mechanical properties and cell
behaviors.

2 Structure of the model

Our modeling framework is, thus, multi—scale; it includes cells,
ECM, cell parts and regulatory molecules that interact in intracellu—
lar networks and molecules that diffuse between cells in the extracel—
lular space and affect gene expression in other cells (see
Supplementary Fig. 81). The parameters of the model specify how
much each molecule regulates those and also the intra and extracel—
lular molecule regulatory network. The model allows to implement
any arbitrary gene network and initial condition. Thus, different im-
plementations of the model will have different number of param-
eters according to how many genes and molecules it includes. The
number of subcellular elements (also called nodes in here) in a cell
and the number of cells can change due to cell growth and cell
division.

2.1 Biomechanics

Subcellular elements or nodes represent a physical part of a cell.
Mesenchymal nodes are spherical, while epithelial nodes are cylin-
drical. Each cylinder consists of two elements that move independ—
ently, an apical and a basal one, which may have different
mechanical properties. These two nodes are tied by an elastic spring
(Fig. 1E). The ECM consists of spherical nodes that do not belong to
any cell.

ADD

Each node has a radius of interaction p that defines the max—

imum distance at which the node is in contact with other nodes and

EQD at which the mechanical interaction is

a radius of equilibrium p
at equilibrium (i.e. the interaction force is zero). Nodes i and j will
experience a repulsive force when they are closer than their equilib-

rium distance (deD = prD + PEQD

,- ) and an attractive force when

Fig. 1. (A) Mechanical interactions between spherical elements are deter-
mined by the distance between their centers and their distance of equilib-
rium. (B-D) Mechanical interactions between two cylindric elements or
between a cylindric and a spheric one act along a vector normal to the surface
of interaction between the two elements. (E) The two nodes composing a
cylindric element are tied by an unbreakable elastic spring. (F) Epithelial
bending is regulated by two different forces, a bending radial force and a
bending rotational force. All arrows represent force vectors

their distance is longer than dig-(2D but closer than elf/)DD (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Data). The modulus fAij of the mechanical force vec—
tor is calculated as,

fAij = legEP(d,-,- — deD) if d,,- < deD
fAz-l- = leg-(OW)- — dEQD> if al.-,- ngQD <1)
fAii : 0 if 611," Z dg-‘DD

Note that the elastic coefficients (leng and kEOU) may be differ-
ent in the repulsive and attractive case and depend on the mechan—
ical properties of the nodes i and j (that in our model can be
regulated by molecules). The direction of force vectors differ be—
tween the mesenchymal—mesenchymal, the epithelial—epithelial and
the epithelial—mesenchymal interaction, since vectors need to be nor—
mal to the contact interface between the two elements (Fig. 1B-D,
see Supplementary Data). Our model, thus, makes the assumption,
as in the SEM, that cell shape can be represented with some degree
of accuracy by a set of movable points (the nodes) that adhere to
each other (so that each cell is a cohesive entity by the cohesion be—
tween its nodes). This way adhesion between cells is represented
also as adhesion between nodes. We also assume that no two cells
can occupy the same physical space and that, thus, there would a re—
pulsion force when two nodes get to close.

The model also assumes, in contrast to the SEM, that epithelial
tissues always tend to minimize local curvature (Forgacs and
Newman 2005) and that epithelial cells always tend to orient their
apical—basal axis normal to the local tissue surface. In order to evalu—
ate the local curvature between apical nodes i and 1', we consider the
vector 67,-, connecting those two nodes, 5}; and $71 as the vectors that
define the elastic link to their basal counterparts and mﬁkl as the
sum of s}; and $71 which defines the vector normal to the surface

between i and j. The bending radial force tends to minimize the local
curvature of the epithelial sheet, while the bending rotational force
reorients the cylinders, so that their longitudinal axis (3) is always
normal to the epithelial surface (Fig. 1F, see also Supplementary Fig.
84B and C). The bending radial force is defined by the vector ngTii
and the bending rotational force by fEﬁp,,-,

Where leg-ST and leng derive from node’s mechanical properties apd
the circumflex denotes unit vector. Note that the force vector fESTii
will be normal to the epithelial surface and fggpii will be parallel to
the vector connecting i and j (Fig. 1F).

Motion is computed by a hybrid method, solving a system of
PDEs assuming Langevin overdamped dynamics (see Supplementary
Data) and then applying Monte Carlo random displacements to a
certain proportion of nodes at each time step (See Supplementary
Data). This way some stochasticity is introduced into the model.

2.2 Gene and molecular regulation

The model assumes that all molecules are contained within the sys—
tem’s nodes, whether they belong to a cell or to ECM. Diffusion is
then the transport of molecules between nodes. Thus, both calcula—
tions of movement and specific molecule concentrations occur only
on nodes and molecules carried by nodes, respectively. We use the
term regulatory molecules to refer to any molecule irrespectively of
whether a molecule is a gene product or not.

Each regulatory molecule has a set of intrinsic characteristics
that are assumed to be genetically encoded and thus do not change
over model dynamics. We call those molecular parameters. For each
regulatory molecule, these are diffusivity coefficient, intrinsic rate of
degradation, regulatory interactions at the level of transcription and
at the level of catalytic reactions, regulation of each node property
and regulation of cell behaviors and cell properties (See
Supplementary Data). Some regulatory molecules act as inter—cellu—
lar adhesion molecules, for which there is a matrix that specifies the
binding affinity of each pair of adhesion molecules. Transcription
occurs only in the nuclear node of each cell, and we assume it fol—
lows a saturating function similar to Michaelis—Menten (as in many
other previous models, Mjolsness et al. 1991):

"g

1:
9a = —1,g <4)

1 + q) 2 tlkgzl

Where Qik is the rate of transcription of gene [a in node i, g1] is the
amount of transcriptional factor I in node i and tlk is the strength by
which each specific transcriptional factor k activates (positive tlk) or
inhibits (negative tlk) the transcription of gene 1. The sum is done
through all the regulatory molecules and by definition only tran-
scriptional factors have tlk terms different from zero. The set of tlk
values in a model constitute the matrix T (whose size depends on the
number of genes included in the model). 0) is a function that is equal
to 0 for values of x smaller than 0 and equals to x when x is greater
than 0 (@(x) = 0 if x < 0 and @(x) = x if x > 0). This function is
used to ensure that there is no such a thing as negative transcription
(although tlk can be negative and thus repress transcription).

The model represents two states of the same protein as two dif—
ferent regulatory molecules with different molecular properties.

of one regulatory molecule into another. Thus,

The first term defines the rate of production of regulatory mol—
ecule k in node 1' due to the transformation of other molecule 1 into [3
catalyzed by j. The second term defines the rate of loss of form [a due
to its transformation into molecule 1 mediated by catalysis by 1'. Each
element rjlk specifies the catalytic activity of regulatory molecule j on
the transformation of regulatory molecule 1 into regulatory molecule
13. As before, we assume Michaelis—Menten kinetics similar to those
known to occur in enzymatically catalyzed reactions. For simplicity,
we assume KM equals 1. As before the set of all, rjlk values consti—
tutes matrix R.

2.3 Molecular diffusion and signaling

We assume that regulatory molecules can diffuse between nodes in a
cell. Extracellular diffusible molecules can diffuse between nodes in
different cells. For these molecules, its concentration in a node repre—
sents concentration in the extracellular space close to the node.
Diffusion cannot occur in empty space but it can occur in aqueous
media represented as ECM nodes. This is implemented by applying
Fick’s second law in the context of the irregular and changing mesh
made by all the nodes that are not too far from each other (this dis—
tance is itself considered, see Supplementary Data for details). This
method allows to implement diffusion in a way that is not computa—
tionally very costly. Since molecules are only defined within nodes,
they cannot diffuse toward empty spaces or cavities. This limitation
can be overcome, if necessary, by filling empty spaces with ECM
nodes. Diffusible molecules may interact with membrane receptors.
The model also considers membrane tethered ligand and receptor
complexes, such as in the Notch—Delta signaling pathway (Meir et
al. 2002, see Supplementary Data).

2.4 Cell behaviors and regulation of node properties

The model is specifically designed to incorporate all animal cell be—
haviors as simple rules on cell nodes (Fig. 2, see Supplementary Data
and Supplementary Figs. 85—810). This way the temporal and spatial
scales of these rules are compatible with each other. Growth is in-
crease in the sizes of the elements in a cell, until a maximum element
size is reached (Fig. 2A and Supplementary Fig. S6). Only then a
new small element is added to the cell, which can then undergo fur—
ther growth. The model allows to choose the number of elements a
cell is made of (though that number may ﬂuctuate due to growth,
division or death). Large number of elements per cell should be
chosen when cell shape changes are a driving force in development.
Otherwise cells can be chosen to comprise few or even a single elem—
ent. Cell division is the splitting of a cell’s nodes between two daugh—
ter cells (Fig. 2B and Supplementary Fig. S7, see Supplementary
Data). Apoptosis is implemented as a gradual decrease in the size of
nodes in a cell (Fig. 2C and Supplementary Fig. 88, see
Supplementary Data) until nodes, and eventually the cell, disappear.
Adhesion is implemented as the strength of the attractive force be—
tween elements from different cells. Cell contraction, or expansion,
is simply a limited decrease, or increase, in the size of some elements
in a cell. This can occur actively as a result of gene expression
changes. Nodes can also have some degree of plasticity, which can
be genetically regulated, and decrease or increase their size if put

under strong compressive or tensile forces, respectively, by sur—
rounding nodes. Migration is the result of random node movement
(see Supplementary Data) biased by differential adhesion or chemo-
attractant gradients (although the mobility of elements can be
increased by gene regulation to simulate cell body extensions like
filopodia). Cell shape changes are the result of the relative move—
ments of the elements in a cell. ECM secretion results from the pro—
duction of ECM nodes by cells expressing a specific gene (Fig. 2D
and Supplementary Fig. S9, see Supplementary Data). Cells can also
undergo epithelial—mesenchymal transitions (Fig. 2E and
Supplementary Fig. 810, see Supplementary Data).

An important aspect of our model is that all cell behaviors and
elements’ bio—mechanical properties (such as adhesion) can be af—
fected by the regulatory molecules present in nodes. Specific equa—
tions apply for the molecular regulation of each cell behavior, see
Supplementary Data for details. Each column of matrix C specifies
how strongly each molecule positively or negatively regulates a cer—
tain cell behavior.

Regulation of node mechanical properties at each time step
follows:

P1110 = $09,110) + (1 — PPIF)Z€I/egzk> (6)
k=1

Where p11- (t) is the value of node property I in node i at time t and
pll-(O) is the value of that node property I in node i when the node

was created (this is in the initial condition or when the node first

DIF

arose through growth). [9,- is the degree of differentiation in node i

(differentiation slows down changes in nodes). The effect of mol—
ecule k on node property I is the model parameter elk of matrix E.

EQD

A slightly different rule applies to node size, p . At each time

step, this property is equal to:

The first term is due to active contraction, the second to cell growth
or apoptosis, the third to cell mechanical plasticity and the fourth to vol—
ume conservation. Cell contraction occurs when a molecule regulates
negatively the node property [)COD. Since contraction is happening in
the nodes, cells may have contraction in only part of its nodes, as it is
necessary in a number of developmental processes such as in invagin—
ation by apical cell contraction. pCOD is calculated as in Equation (7)
above. The other terms are explained in the Supplementary Data.

The cell behaviors described above are in fact the most basic ani—
mal cells have. However, individual cells can do more complex behav—
iors by differentially activating these basic cell behaviors in different
parts of the cell. This is possible in our model because different nodes
in a cell can have different concentrations of different regulatory mol—
ecules (since transcription occurs in the nucleus node but other reac—
tions and signaling occurs in all nodes). This allows a rich set of
spatially polarized cell behaviors. Thus, for instance, the orientation
of cell division plane is by default normal to the longest axis of the
cell following Hertwig’s rule (Minc et al. 201 1) but can be oriented in
the model by the direction of intra—cellular gene product gradients
through the nodes in a cell (that may arise from extra—cellular gradi—
ents through signaling, not affecting transcription). In a similar man-
ner, intra—cellular gradients can regulate asymmetric division (Salazar—
Ciudad et al. 2003) quantitatively controlling how much larger is one
daughter cell with respect to the other. Similarly, intracellular differ-
ences in regulatory molecule concentrations can lead to contraction of
only specific parts of a cell, as in the apical contraction required for
invagination of epithelia. Similarly, cells can migrate in a polarized
manner by preferentially extending more filopodia toward one side of
the cell than to others. This can be reproduced in the model by differ—
entially regulating the mobility of nodes along the cell.

2.5 Initial conditions, model parameters and model
structure

For the application of the model to the study of pattern formation
and morphogenesis in a specific experimental developmental system,
three sets of developmental parameters need to be specified by the
user: (i) The network of interactions between regulatory molecules
(the T and R matrices), (ii) how these regulatory molecules affect
each node property (E matrix) and cell behavior (C matrix) and (iii)
the initial conditions as the spatial location of each node and the
quantity of each regulatory molecule in each of them.

3 Implementation

The EmbryoMaker software implements the model herein described
and provides a user—friendly environment to design and manipulate
custom developmental systems. An editor allows the user to design
cells, nodes and gene expression in the initial conditions or at any
time during a simulation. The NetworkMaker software allows to
design and edit gene network topologies and set model parameters.
A central panel displays each application network. User Manuals
are downloadable from ‘http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/salazar/
software.html’. We use the cell behavior ontology (Sluka et al.
2014) for the example model of sea urchin gastrulation (Section 4).
The OWL file describing the system can be downloaded from
‘http://www.biocenter.helsinki.fi/salazar/software.html’.

4 Application examples

In this section, we provide a set of examples of how the model can
be applied to animal development. The aim in these examples is not

to understand their dynamics better but to show that the model is
realistic and general enough to consider many different animal sys-
tems. We have started by implementing a set of developmental
mechanisms that have been proposed to be the most basic ones in
animal development (Salazar—Ciudad et al. 2003). This is the simpler
developmental mechanisms able to produce pattern formation by
using only one cell behavior (see Fig. 3 and Supplementary Figs.
S1 1—S16 for the genotype—phenotype maps).

We also apply the model to a paradigmatic example of animal
morphogenesis: the sea urchin gastrulation (Lane et al. 1993). In
this example, we do not intend to provide any new fundamental
understanding about the sea urchin development per 56. Instead we
use sea urchin gastrulation to explain the steps by which the model
is applied to a specific system.

At the onset of gastrulation, the sea urchin embryo consists of a
hollow sphere of epithelial cells with some mesenchymal cells scat—
tered in the blastocoel cavity. At the vegetal pole of the embryo,
there is a group of cells called the vegetal plate. The early invagin-
ation of the vegetal plate arises from two combined processes: the
apical constriction of the vegetal plate cells and the secretion of
ECM on their apical side (Lane et al. 1993). Experiments by Lane
et al. applied different drugs to sea urchin embryos to specifically

the other different degrees of invagination were achieved, with no
invagination when both drugs were applied.

ECM layer acting as the semi—rigid egg cover of the sea urchin (hya—
line layer). It is known that only cells in the vegetal plate are
involved in apical constriction and ECM secretion, so we assume a
molecule (from now on called molecule A) to be present in the ap—
ical side of the most central vegetal cells in the embryo (in black in
Fig. 4) to regulate those two processes. The model assumes that
actomyosin contraction in the apical cell cortex triggered by mol-
ecule A results in a decrease of apical cell surface, which is translated
as a decrease in apical surface of the cell’s cylinders. The initial con-
ditions were set with the EmbryoMaker editor. We set the three dif—
ferent experimental conditions using NetworkMaker. In the first,
we set an elk value different from zero and negative, so that A leads

to apical contraction by decreasing the contraction radius, [)COD, as

Fig. 4. Application of the model to sea urchin gastrulation. (A) A hollow spher-
ical epithelium surrounded by a rigid outer layer of ECM. A group of cells in
the vegetal pole of the embryo express a specific gene product on their apical
side (black). The ‘black gene product’ may regulate cell constriction, ECM se-
cretion or both. (B) Different degrees of invagination, measured as the depth
of the archenteron (black arrow), are achieved using each one of the mechan-
isms or both at the same time. All simulations were run 1500 time steps.
Parameter values for: active contraction eACOD = —0.05, active ECM secretion
eAECM = 0.9, inactive contraction eACOD = 0.0 and inactive ECM secretion
eAECM 20.9. Other node properties were set homogeneous among all nodes
for all simulations: pREcz 5.0, p(°‘DH = 5.0, pESTz 10.0, pERP=10.0, pEQDz 0.15
and pADDz 0.27. The latter are standard values in which epithelia are stable

specified in Equation (7) (with [a being for contraction and I being
for molecule A). In the second experiment, A promotes the secretion
of ECM in the nodes where it is present according to the equation
for ECM secretion:

 

8PECM "g
a, — m; cngm. (8)

Where pIECM is the rate at which ECM accumulates around node i.
(:51de is the C matrix element where the effect of molecule m (in this

case A) on ECM secretion is specified and gim is the concentration of
ECM

m in node 1'. Once [9,- reaches a value of one a ECM node is se—
creted near node i (see Supplementary Data for the equations for the
molecular regulation of other cell behaviors). Thus, this equation
simply assumes that the rate of secretion of ECM is a linear function
of the concentration of the regulatory molecules that promotes this
secretion.

In the third experiment, A promotes both processes at the same
time. The first experiment is the one in which an applied drug in-
hibits ECM secretion, the second is the one in which a drug inhibits
apical contraction and the third is the one in which no drugs are
applied. The experiments thus only involve different values in the
6A COD and 6A ECM parameters. These were manually set to match the
morphologies observed in the two drug experiments. When these
two values are used at the same time, in the third experiment, a
deeper invagination resembling the one observed experimentally
(Lane et al. 1993), when drugs are not added is found in the model

simulations (Fig. 4B). There are several earlier modelling approaches

on sea urchin gastrulation (Cummings 1990, 1994, 2005 ; Davidson
et al. 1995) that undergo a more analytical and systematic study of
the invagination process. However, as we mention earlier, our aim
in this example is only to show that our model can be applied to real
developmental systems.

The above examples consider only developmental mechanisms that
involve only one or two cell behaviors at the same time. An additional
example combines the regulation of several different cell behaviors to
show how from simple initial conditions (Fig. 5) a more complex gas—
trula—like embryo can be produced (see Supplementary Data section 2
for a more detailed explanation of the observed dynamics).

5 Discussion

Our model differs from previous ones in implementing all the cell
behaviors known in animal cells. In addition, it explicitly imple-
ments the molecular quantitative regulation of all cell mechanical
properties and cell behaviors. Ours differs from previous models in
explicitly considering the different mechanical properties of epithe—
lial and mesenchymal cells and ECM and their interactions.

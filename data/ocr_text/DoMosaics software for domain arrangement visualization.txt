ABSTRACT

Summary: DoMosaics is an application that unifies protein domain
annotation, domain arrangement analysis and visualization in a
single tool. It simplifies the analysis of protein families by consolidating
disjunct procedures based on often inconvenient command-line
applications and complex analysis tools. It provides a simple user
interface with access to domain annotation services such as
InterProScan or a local HMMER installation, and can be used to com-
pare, analyze and visualize the evolution of domain architectures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein evolution can be treated as a series of domain-wise
changes that alter their domain arrangement (or architecture),
the sequence of a proteins’ constituent domains. The majority of
novel arrangements can be explained by rearranging domains
and processes such as fusion, ﬁssion and terminal domain loss
are thought to be the primary forces at play (Moore et al., 2013).
The signatures of domains are stored in specialized domain data-
bases such as Pfam (Punta et al., 2012), SUPERFAMILY (de
Lima Morais et al., 2011) or InterPro (Hunter et al., 2012).
Existing tools that exploit domain content for evolutionary ana-
lysis focus on speciﬁc aspects, primarily the identiﬁcation of
homologous proteins, and are often limited to a single domain
deﬁnition database. Services are either provided in the form of
web servers such as d-Omix Michadakul et al., 2009) or
DAhunter (now WDAC) (Lee and Lee, 2008), or as standalone
applications such as PfamAlyzer (Hollich and Sonnhammer,
2007), Nifas (Storm and Sonnhammer, 2001) or XDOM
(Gouzy et al., 1997). The recently described tool ArchSchema
(Tamuri and Laskowski, 2010) takes a domain-graph approach
to illustrate related domain arrangements. However, none of
these tools combine annotation, analysis, search and Visualiza-
tion into a single framework.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst three
authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

DoMosaics collates all steps from domain annotation, hom-
ology search, analysis of architectural evolution to creation of
customizable publication-ready ﬁgures into a single tool.

2 METHODS

DoMosaics is a JAVA program and requires JAVA 1.6 or better.
Phylogenetic trees can be constructed based on sequences remotely
using SOAP services or locally using distances between domain
arrangements in the form of domain edit or J accard distances. Tree com-
putation makes use of the Phylogenetic Analysis Library by Drummond
and Strimmer (2001); tree Visualization loosely uses procedures described
by Griebel et a]. (2008). Searches for similar domain arrangement by
domain string alignments are performed using the RADS/RAMPAGE
web service (Terrapon et al., 2013). Finally, DoMosaics allows for
content-dependent annotation using CODD (Terrapon et al., 2009).

3 RESULTS

The program can be started directly from the DoMosaics web
page using JAVA Web Start. Alternatively, a precompiled JAVA
archive ﬁle (JAR) can be downloaded. An example dataset and
the program documentation are included in the program.

3.1 Example: Drosophila aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases

We applied DoMosaics to a simple analysis of the Drosophila
aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases (see Fig. 1). We extracted FlyBase
deﬁned orthologs of the Drosophila melanogaster protein
FBpp0083898 and loaded the corresponding fasta ﬁle into a
new DoMosaics project. Domain annotation was conducted in
two steps. First, all sequences were annotated using the remote
hmmpfam scan provided by the InterProScan service for which
DoMosaics provides a graphical user interface. Second, domain
annotation was derived based on a local installation of hmmscan
against Pfam-deﬁned models; in this second scan we used a high
E—Value cutoff of 2.0 as opposed to the model-deﬁned gathering
thresholds used by InterProScan. Domain annotation reveals
four unique arrangements (see Fig. la). All arrangements contain
the C—terminal domains ProRS-C_l and HGTP_anticodon.
Three arrangements contain N—tenninal deletions; the arrange-
ment found in Drosophila sechellia lacks the WHEP—TRS repeat
array and the C—terminal region of the tRNA-synt_2b domains.
Traces of the latter are only found by loosening E—Value; how-
ever, such traces are also recognizable in the domain dotplot (see
Fig lb). The context-dependent annotation using CODD and

Fig. 1. Drosophila orthologs of aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases. (a) Domains were annotated and arrangements were associated with a species tree.
Domains were manually aligned; same domains were aligned by comparison of domain sequences. Domains are illustrated as unproportional boxes;
dotted white boxes signify CODD domains that match below the model deﬁned threshold, yet can be asserted based on domain co-occurrence (Terrapon
et al., 2009). Annotation against Pfam models shows four unique arrangements; context-dependent annotation conducted using CODD and loosened
E—Value thresholds show traces of a C-terminal glutathione S-transferase domain in nine arrangements and traces of tRNA-synt_1e, RNA _pol_rpb1_1
and Val_tRNA-synt_C in three, two and one arrangement, respectively. 0)) Domain dotplot (a dotplot that includes pairwise domain sequence com-
parisons indicated as percent identity) of the aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases found in D.melan0gaster and D.sechellia. The domain dotplot indicates a
deletion of the WHEP-TRS repeat array, possibly also effecting the tRNA-synt_2b domain, of which only traces can be found in D.sechellia (ﬁgure
exported as.svg followed by minor edits: border/color change of putative domains; above-tree domain legend)

relaxed E—Value thresholds reveals traces of a number of previ-
ously unseen domains, such as the C—terminal occurring GST_C
domain or the tRNA-synt_le domain.

Although it remains unclear whether differences correspond to
evolutionary events or annotation artifacts stemming from pro-
ﬁle bias or failure in gene predictions, such analysis is quickly
conducted and allows Visual inspection of possible events. All
steps, from the annotation to the analysis and Visualization can

be conducted within minutes.

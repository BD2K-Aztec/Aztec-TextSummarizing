ABSTRACT

Motivation: We present a method that identifies associations
between amino acid changes in potentially significant sites in an
alignment (taking into account several amino acid properties) with
phenotypic data, through the phylogenetic mixed model. The latter
accounts for the dependency of the observations (organisms). It is
known from previous studies that the pathogenic aspect of many
organisms may be associated with a single or just few changes
in amino acids, which have a strong structural and/or functional
impact on the protein. Discovering these sites is a big step toward
understanding pathogenicity. Our method is able to discover such
sites in proteins responsible for the pathogenic character of a group
of bacteria.

Results: We use our method to predict potentially significant sites
in the RpoS protein from a set of 209 bacteria. Several sites with
significant differences in biological relevant regions were found.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next—generation sequencing has dramatically increased the amount
of biological data available. This technology has made sequencing
cheaper and faster, while stimulating the development of several
methodologies. The number of sequenced genomes has increased
dramatically over the past few years, reaching 1815 sequenced
genomes at the time of writing (Genome Project database at the
NCBI). In bacteria, several strains are sequenced from different
organisms with the number of available genomes steadily increasing.
At this time, >3800 strains corresponding to >400 species are
being sequenced (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/lproks.cgi,
last accessed date April 25, 2011).

The multitude of genomes gives the possibility to identify
orthologous groups of proteins among many closely related strains.
For very similar strains, thousands of these orthologous groups
may exist, implying a dimension expansion of problems involving
alignments. Indeed, aligning thousands of proteins from hundreds

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of strains, exploring the alignments and identifying interesting sites
is a daunting task. When dealing with very large alignments, the
overview is easily lost. This leads to the idea of establishing a more
automated way of ﬁnding signiﬁcant positions in the alignments,
that are sites in the protein in which amino acid changes could alter
the function.

In general, multiple sequence alignments identify regions of
similarity that may result from functional, structural or evolutionary
relationships between the sequences and frequently a mixture
of them. If two sequences in an alignment share a common
ancestor, mismatches can be interpreted as point mutations and
gaps as insertions or deletions introduced in one or both lineages
since they diverged from that ancestor. Hence, behind a multiple
sequence alignment of orthologs lies a phylogeny. When analyzing
alignments in order to perform association studies with some meta—
information, such as speciﬁc phenotypic data, one should therefore
consider the phylogenetic relationship between the organisms.
The method presented here identiﬁes associations between amino
acid changes in ‘interesting’ positions in an alignment (taking
into account several amino acid properties) with some meta—
information (e. g. phenotypic data). The proposed method has general
applicability to other organisms, different amino acid properties,
different metadata. As a motivating example, we applied it to a set
of 209 bacterial strains belonging to several genera (72 genera, 117
species) with the aim of ﬁnding amino acid changes that might be
correlated with the pathogenicity of the bacteria.

The pathogenicity character is mainly determined by the presence
of speciﬁc genes, such as toxins, often referred to as virulence
genes. However, several studies have shown that the pathogenicity
character of different bacterial strains is determined by changes in
amino acids causing changes in protein structure, and hence function
(Conenello et al., 2007; Marjuki et al., 2010; Sokurenko et al., 1998).
Thus, the pathogenicity character can also be conferred by speciﬁc
genetic variations having an effect on protein function and not solely
by the presence or absence of virulence factor genes as previously
assumed (Falkow, 1997). We have assembled a screening method
that identiﬁes signiﬁcant sites in an alignment (which might confer
the pathogenicity character to some bacteria) through the application
of linear mixed models on different amino acid properties in each
of those columns.

Amino acid properties can be grouped according to many different
characteristics, such as size, polarity, alpha helix or beta sheet
propensity. Substitutions severely changing the value of some key
properties (e. g. from polar to non—polar) tend to have a stronger effect
on the tertiary structure, and probably on the function of the protein.

Identifying associations between amino acid changes and meta information

 

If those substitutions are associated with the label (metadata),
they deﬁne an ‘interesting’ alignment position, which might be
responsible for pathogenicity. The amino acid properties considered
depend on the speciﬁc problem as will be discussed later.

Our method is divided into several steps, which we shall outline
below. Additionally, we provide results from a real biological
example. Finally, we discuss the ﬂexibility of the method as well
as potential applications.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

As explained above, pathogenicity can result from a mutation of some
speciﬁc amino acids of the protein. Such a mutation could alter some local
structural feature of the protein, with potential functional impact. In order
to ﬁnd this variation, we need to look for potentially ‘interesting’ columns
in alignments. To those columns, given the class label (metadata) of the
organisms and some relevant amino acid properties, (generalized) linear
mixed models are applied to determine the effect of some relevant amino acid
properties on pathogenicity. The method can be summarized as follows:

(1) Find orthologous groups of n genomes where the label of the organism
(such as pathogen/non—pathogen) is known.

(2) For each orthologous group, let A be the alignment of n genomes
restricted to the group.

(3) Filter out irrelevant columns, keeping columns with sufﬁcient
changes. Only consider these columns in the following steps.

(4) Apply a phylogenetic mixed model to each column of the
subalignment on each relevant amino acid property using the
phylogenetic relationship matrix (from the phylogenetic tree) to
account for non—independent observations.

(5) Identify for each column the correlation of the label and the amino
acid property, generally via the contrast of ‘ﬁxed’ effects.

(6) Summarize results and compute statistical measures.

The approach was implemented in the bcool R package available at the
CRAN network http://cran.r—project.org/.

2.2 Applying the phylogenetic mixed model

Orthologous groups are determined for the proteins of interest, and
alignments are generated. Before proceeding with each alignment, we discard
irrelevant columns from the alignment. First, the columns without variance,
mainly the perfectly conserved sites, are discarded. In addition, we ﬁlter out
sites with a high number of gaps. On each of the remaining columns, a linear
mixed model is applied. The phylogenetic mixed model of Lynch (PMM)
partitions phenotypic values into three components:

i=xB+zZt+a (1)

where I7 is the vector of observations (the dependent variable), B is the vector
of ﬁxed effects, Z; is the vector of phylogenetic heritable additive effects and
Z is the vector of independent and identically distributed residual errors. X is
the incidence matrix that associates effects with observations. The number
of columns of X are the number of ﬁxed effect levels one wants to consider.
Z is the matrix that associates additive effects with observations. Both of
them, X and Z, are matrices relating the observations I7 to the regressors
B and 31.

Equation (1) is applicable to very general cases, especially B could be a
vector holding the re gres sors for many different ﬁxed effects and several link
functions can be used for Y, extending the theory to generalized linear mixed
models. In the case of a binary labeling (such as pathogen/non—pathogen),
X contains the labels of the organisms, thus having a dimension of n x 2
(n being the number of organisms considered). Vector Xil corresponds to the

pathogens and it holds xil =1 for pathogens, and xil =0 for non—pathogens.
Vector X12 stands for non—pathogens and it holds x12 =0 for pathogens and
x12 2 1 for non—pathogens.

Each y,- is the value of the amino acid property considered in the
organism i. Z is the matrix relating species to observations and in our
case corresponds to a diagonal matrix of dimensions n x n. Random effects
are normally distributed with mean 0 and variance matrices R and G,
corresponding to residual and additive effects, respectively. In the univariate
case, R=In><oe2 and G=AXO§, 03 and 03 standing for residual and
additive variances. The A matrix represents the phylogenetic relations
between the n organisms. It holds evolutionary ‘time’ values tl‘j representing
the time that organism i shared with organism j before speciation. The a,-
and el- values stand for random organism effects and the error term for
each organism, respectively. These two vectors, and the ﬁxed effects, B,
are the ones to be estimated. B has dimension 2 (pp: pathogen, ﬁnp: non—
pathogen) in our binary case, since we are calculating the ﬁxed effects of
the pathogenicity. Henderson and coworkers (Henderson, 1949) found an
approach to efﬁciently estimate the ﬁxed and random effects via BLUE
(best linear unbiased estimator) and BLUP (best linear unbiased predictor),
when the variance of El and Z are known. However, this is not the most
general scenario which, in effect, is not applicable to our speciﬁc case.
Hence, estimation methodologies are applied for inferring the values of B,
Z; and 2 together with the variances. Bayesian and frequentist approaches
are usually applied, each of them with their advantages and disadvantages
(Blasco, 2001). In this work, a Bayesian approach similar to the one presented
by Naya et al. (2006) is chosen, hence not just a single value for the difference
between B, and B”, is determined, but a posterior probability distribution.
Our package makes extensive usage of the main function implemented in
the MCMCglmm package (Hadﬁeld, 2010).

As stated above, we ﬁltered non—signiﬁcant columns and we apply a
PMM to each of the remaining for each amino acid property. Let us say p
‘interesting’ columns are found (after ﬁltering or with Analysis of Variance
(ANOVA), entropy or conditional entropy, see Section 2.5) and m amino
acid properties are considered relevant for the labels of the n organisms
(e. g. pathogen, non—pathogen). For each column 1...p and each property
1...m Equation (1) is solved, each combination giving a different I7 vector,
providing estimations of B, Z; and E (Fig. 1). Instead of working with two
distributions, BI, and Bnp, we are interested in the difference Bdiffz BI, — Bnp.
The processing of the columns, that is, applying the PMM to each of the p
n x m matrices, generates m x p posterior distributions of the ﬁxed effects.
These are further processed for signiﬁcance determination, as explained in
the next section.

2.3 Finding the really signiﬁcant columns

In our case, m distributions (ﬁxed effects) are calculated for each column.
A way of summarizing the data can be seen in Figure 2. In the matrix M,
rows represent the m properties, while the p columns represent the interesting
sites in the alignment. Each entry Mi]- holds a selected summary statistic,
for example the number of times (iterations) the difference of Bp—Bnp is >0
(gtOij) for property i in column j. Also, P—values from a t—test (or other tests)
might be used as a signiﬁcant summary statistic. Here, we focus on gt0.
Since gt0 displays the proportion of the distribution being >0, not only large
values of gt0 represent a large difference between B], and Bnp, but also small
values (Bdiff negative values). Hence, very large or very small gt0 values are
relevant, since they show a signiﬁcant difference between the two labels.
In order to assess the global signiﬁcance of the alignment position based
on the gt0 of each property, in a ﬁrst step a transformation is performed:
le=2'(gt0ij—O.5), to center the values. Tij values close to 1 and —1 are
signiﬁcant. One could simply set a signiﬁcance level, say 0.9 and —0.9,
and consider the entries above or below that number signiﬁcant. Here, we
summarize all entries corresponding to one column even further:

amino acid properties are considered relevant for the determination of the

For each column, one obtains an n xm matrix representing the values of
the property for each amino acid in the column (rightmost matrix). On
this matrix, a phylogenetic mixed model is applied, obtaining as a result
estimations for the Bdiff vector. In this case, Bdiff is the difference of
the distributions of pathogen and non—pathogen. m such distributions are
determined for each of the p columns, resulting in an m x p matrix.

Fig. 2. For each column, a statistical value is calculated and a summary
statistic is determined. ST}. represents the relevance of the column j, large
ST}. values (close to 1) suggest a crucial alignment column.

ST}. lies between 0 and 1. The larger the value, the more signiﬁcant the
column. A value of 1 suggests that all properties have values of 1 or —1 in
that column, hence the relevance of the column is very high.

One would like to know the distribution of the score in order to be
able to assess a signiﬁcance value for the column. It is easy to see that a
linear relationship of ST}. with a standard xi distribution exists: under the

null hypothesis of no differences between ﬁxed effects (BdiffZO), gt0 has a
binomial distribution, with success probability P=0.5. For big k (number
of iterations), gm—P follows a standard normal distribution. It follows that

The sum of squares of standard normally distributed variables is X2

Summarizing for each column we obtain

which is x; distributed with m degrees of freedom. Normally k corresponds
to the number of iterations in each MCMC run, which is the same for each
property. However, since autocorrelation is expected in each run, the real
number of independent iterations becomes smaller. Hence, we also calculated
here the S’ score with the effective number of iterations kmaj, so the formula
becomes a little different: since k is changing with the property and site (km)
it cannot be factored out from the sum.

Since S’ has a known distribution, statistical signiﬁcance can be
assessed. Nevertheless, when testing the signiﬁcance on real data, almost all
columns were considered signiﬁcant. That is, the null hypothesis (proportion
of differences > 0) is too weak to represent the biological problem
under investigation, making the consideration of the score’s signiﬁcance
impractical. Still, ST]. is intuitive and easy to understand, since it ranges
from 0 to 1. Moreover, the sole fact of a column being statistically signiﬁcant
does not mean that it is biologically signiﬁcant. Hence, the effect size has
to be measured as well. In addition to the ST score, we calculated the effect
sizes for each property by dividing the median of Bdiff by the range of
the corresponding amino acid property. These values (for each of the ﬁve
considered properties per column) were squared, then added together and
ﬁnally the square root was taken. This value correspond to the [2 norm for
the effect sizes. When analyzing the correlation between the ST score and
the effect sizes one ﬁnds high correlations, as discussed below.

2.4 Permutation test for signiﬁcance assessment

We implemented a simple permutation test to check for signiﬁcance on
the obtained ST scores. For this, we randomly permuted the amino acids
at a given position (and thus, the properties) and calculated the ST score.
This approach is computationally very expensive and only practical for few
sites. However, as discussed below, the permutation test displayed beneﬁcial
properties that allows its usage for all potentially signiﬁcant sites.

2.5 Alternative fast determination of potentially
signiﬁcant columns

Since our approach is computationally expensive for large alignments,
particularly with evolutionary distant species, we considered three fast
alternative methods that could lead to potentially similar results: (i) the
entropy of the columns, (ii) the reduction of the conditional entropy
and (iii) ANOVA P—values. The well—known entropy (Shannon, 1948) is
associated with the degree of uncertainty of a variable. The logic behind
considering entropy as a fast approach to identify potentially ‘interesting’
sites is that only the columns with enough variation can reasonably explain
the differences between labels. Tightly related, the conditional entropy
quantiﬁes the remaining entropy of a random variable Y given that the
value of another random variable X is known. In our case, for each
column the random variable X is the label (the pathogenicity) of the
organism and Y is the amino acid at the selected position in the alignment.
Intuitively, the conditional entropy measures the amount of uncertainty that
remains, e. g. how little you know about the amino acid frequency, when the
pathogenicity of the organism is known. If the remaining conditional entropy
is small, the label ‘determines’ the property of the amino acid. When high,
the amino acid frequency is independent from the label. We calculated the
Conditional Entropy Reduction (CER), a value between 0 and 1 for each
column of the alignment. High CER values are promising, while low ones
are less signiﬁcant. It is important to note that these (entropy) approaches
are independent of the amino acid properties selected.

In the same sense, we implemented an ANOVA approach. In its simplest
form, ANOVA provides a statistical test of whether or not the means of several

Identifying associations between amino acid changes and meta information

 

groups are all equal. For each column and each property, one may calculate
the F statistics and a P—value in order to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the
differences of variances within and between the groups. In our example,
there are only two groups, pathogenic and non—pathogenic. The P—values are
log—transformed and the mean and median of the properties are determined.
Moreover, for each column the number of signiﬁcant properties (P—values
< cutoff) is calculated. The latter together with the mean and median give
an idea of which columns have differences in amino acid properties in each
group (pathogens and non—pathogens). Since several ANOVA assumptions
are violated, mainly the independence of the observations, results from this
method can only be considered as a fast and rough approximation to the
phylogenetic mixed model (PMM) endpoints.

2.6 Example dataset

Sigma factors are a family of proteins, which are a subunit of RNA
polymerases in eubacteria and they provide the catalytic core RNA
polymerase with the ability of promoter sequence recognition and initiation
of speciﬁc transcription (Helmann and Chamberlin, 1988). In this work, the
sigma factor 038 (also known as US or RpoS) was used to test the method.
From the KEGG database (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), all the orthologs for
this gene were downloaded and a group of 209 organisms for which the (see
Supplementary Material). The alignment of the 209 RpoS sequences was
performed with MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004). Since we are incorporating the
phylogenetic inertia into the calculations with the PMM, a phylogenetic tree
is needed. For this, we chose seven genes present in all considered organisms:
secA, secE, secY, rpoS, srp54, ftsY and yidC. Their alignments were also
computed with MUSCLE and the tree reconstruction was performed with
Phyml (Guindon et al., 2005) based on the concatenation of these alignments
using default parameters.

The amino acid properties considered were the residue accessible surface
area in folded protein [RAS] (Chothia, 1976), relative mutability [MUT]
(Jones et al., 1992), hydropathy index [KD] (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982),
normalized frequency of alpha—helix [ALPHA] and beta—sheet [BETA] with
weights (Levitt, 1978).

3 RESULTS

In a ﬁrst step, we explored the ability of the three fast scanning
methods with two aims: (i) as fast alternatives to the PMM, and (ii) as
fast initial ﬁltering of columns to further apply the PMM. We deﬁned
ST]. as the gold standard. For this reason, our method was applied
to the 275 columns in the alignment of RpoS that remained after
removing columns that were totally conserved or that contained >5%
gaps. Subsequently, we calculated the ST score for each column.
Unexpectedly, ANOVA and CER performed extremely bad. The rank
correlation between ST}. and CER was —0.204 (P<10T3) while

between ANOVA (median) and ST it was 0.221 (P < 10—3). On the
other hand, the simple entropy approach displayed a rank correlation
of 0.617 (P < 10—15). However, despite the reasonable correlation
value, only 25% of the columns can be safely ignored based on the
entropy value. In the light of these results, it is clear that none of
the previous fast methods reasonably predict the PMM results and
therefore cannot be used in the initial screening procedure. Given
this situation, we continued the analysis with the 275 columns in
the alignment. However, as these methods are based on completely
different assumptions and even theoretical foundations, it could be
interesting to keep them at hand to compare predictions.

A cutoff corresponding to the 95 percentile of ST was chosen
in order to keep the most signiﬁcant columns for further analysis,
which led to 14 remaining columns. Table 1 shows those signiﬁcant
positions and the respective scores for each property as well as the

ST score. Furthermore, we predicted the secondary structure of RpoS
using the PSIPRED server (Bryson et al., 2005) applied to the RpoS
protein from Escherichia coli as model. For each of the signiﬁcant
columns in Table 1, we denoted whether it lies within an alpha helix
or coil region. In addition, the amino acids enriched (5% difference
in the general frequency) at each position in pathogens and non—
pathogens are shown.

In order to assess the signiﬁcance of the ST scores, bootstrapping
was performed, permuting the properties in each bootstrap.
It can easily be appreciated that the distribution of bootstraps for
intermediate or high scores are similar (Fig. 3).

A different approach to ﬁnd ‘interesting’ sites come from the
effect sizes. Figure 4 shows the 12 values per position, smoothed
considering the neighbor positions with a DEMA function (double
exponential moving average). That is, for each position we consider
the whole ‘region’ (n23, the adjacent neighbors at each side) and
average the 12 values weighted by a double exponential according to
the distance. We permuted the positions and calculated the DEMA
for each position, taking only the maximum into account before
permuting positions again. Three different peaks were observed over
the 97.5 percentile of the bootstrap, corresponding to sites 96—98,
374—376 and 510—514 (Fig. 4). Table 2 shows, for each of these
peaks, the difference of the effect size (pathogen—non—pathogen) of
each property, in order to investigate the contribution of each of (see
Supplementary Material for a complete list of effect sizes).

Cumulative effect sizes were calculated in order to observe overall
tendencies along the alignment. Figure 5 shows the cumulative sum
of the effect size in each of the ﬁve properties along the positions
in the alignment. The cumulative effect sizes were calculated based
only on the signiﬁcant positions. Were the distribution of the effect
sizes random, meaning that no tendency in pathogens or non—
pathogens would be detectable, a line oscillating around zero should
be observed (similar to the dotted one).

Finally, in our example, an alignment with 209 species, 275
relevant columns and 5 properties took 8 h for running 105 iterations
in a MacBook Pro with Intel Core i7 processor (2.66GHz) and
8 GB of RAM. While the three approaches we assayed for quick

Fig. 3. The box plots represent the scores calculated from 100 bootstraps
for all positions with signiﬁcant scores (Fig. 2), and three arbitrarily chosen
positions with insigniﬁcant scores (to the right of the dashed line). The
triangles and rhomboids are the actual ST scores. While triangles (signiﬁcant
scores) lie above the bootstrap distribution, rhomboids (insigniﬁcant scores)
are falling into the distribution range. This is in agreement with our
assessment of signiﬁcance based on ST. The empirical distribution of ST
is plotted as a rotated density plot on the right, i.e. the the y—axis represents
the score’s values while the x—axis represents their abundance.

selection of signiﬁcant columns failed to select good candidates
(which precludes their usage in the ﬁltering step), a two stages
approach of the PMM can be used with straightforward results.
The rank correlation between the ﬁnal ST and estimates obtained
at 1000, 5000 and 10000 iterations was always >0.960 (data not
shown). The number of columns to include from a ﬁrst quick run to
retain the ﬁnal 1% to 5% top values was below the double for 5000
and 10 000 iterations. This suggest a ﬁrst run with 10 000 iterations,
selecting a number of top—ranking columns that double the desired
ﬁnal proportion of sites of interest and doing the ﬁnal run only for
this set.

4 DISCUSSION

In the present work, we have shown how linear mixed models
may serve to pinpoint ‘interesting’ residues in protein alignments,
associated with meta—information labels. Our method is closely
connected to the PMM (Lynch, 1991), albeit cast within a Bayesian
framework, as previous work has put forward (Naya et al., 2006).
Linear mixed models are extremely ﬂexible, being particularly
well suited to account for non—independence of observations,
especially when dealing with closely related taxa. We applied the
PMM, using ﬁve amino acid descriptors of our own choice. It is
worth mentioning that while arbitrary, our selection is based on
sensible physicochemical assumptions, under which their mutation
is expected to impact a functional protein. The PMM was performed
over the whole set of relevant columns. As a ﬁrst step, we created
a summary statistic (ST) that allows assessing a site’s signiﬁcance,

the maximums’ bootstrap distribution. Peaks above the upper dashed line

the maximum values obtained by each bootstrap in a violin plot (basically

interquartile range (IQR) and the 1.5—IQR, respectively; a kernel estimate of

with all properties being jointly considered. Several studies divided
the sigma factors (and the RpoS protein) into four regions with
different roles (Gopal and Chatterji, 1997; Gruber and Gross, 2003;
Ohnuma et al., 2000; Reddy et al., 1997). The highest ST score
observed in Table 1 was 0.978, which corresponds to a residue in
Region 3 of RpoS’ structure (position 376, 202 in the reference E. coli
RpoS protein). This region is involved in recognition of the —10
promoter elements (subregions 2.3, 2.4 and 3). Other interesting
residues in Region 3 are 465 and 427 with scores of 0.942 and
0.924, respectively. While columns 376 and 465 are predicted to lie
in alpha—helix secondary structures, column 427 belongs to a coil
region. Following the ST scores, Region 3 harbors most residue
changes associated with pathogenicity. It is noteworthy that leucine
is among the residues enriched at these positions in non—pathogenic
organisms. In pathogenic, valine is enriched for columns 337,
427 and 465. While both residues, valine and leucine, are aliphatic,
they show strong differences in frequencies at alpha—helix and beta—
sheet structures. Additionally, position 514 in the alignment (with
score 0.868), corresponding to subregion 4.2, is very interesting.
Recognition of the —35 promoter element is mediated by a helix—
turn—helix unit in this subregion, and amino acids from this region
may also provide a contact point for some activator proteins.

ST scores near 1 are ‘good’, even though no statistical
signiﬁcance value is attached to them. Moreover, by ordering
the scores increasingly one can rank the columns, from less to
more ‘interesting’, analyzing only the most ‘interesting’ of them.

Fig. 5. Cumulative effect sizes per site in alignment. Only signiﬁcant
changes (according to the gt0 value) were included. Each line corresponds
to one amino acid property.

In our example, the X2 values calculated were almost all signiﬁcant,
even using the correction for the effective number of samples
in MCMC runs and correcting for multiple testing (data not
shown). This problem, probably associated with the very relaxed
null hypothesis tested, makes this statistical approach impractical.
However, techniques such as bootstrapping can be used as a proxy
for the signiﬁcance score. When we performed 100 bootstraps for
the sites with highest ST values, the distributions of values obtained
in the bootstrapping process were well below the real scores (Fig. 3).
On the other hand, when we performed the bootstrap for columns
with low to intermediate scores the real values fell inside the
bootstrap distribution, pointing to the expected non—signiﬁcance.
Furthermore, for medium to very high ST values the bootstrap
distributions were strikingly similar, which in principle allows

a signiﬁcant reduction in the number of columns to consider for
the bootstrap process.

Statistical signiﬁcance of the observed ﬁxed effects is
fundamental to avoid spurious correlations. However, the real
biological signiﬁcance of the observed changes is probably more
associated to the effect size, that is, the relative difference in each
of the considered properties. While correlation between ST and
effect sizes were reasonably high and signiﬁcant for all considered
properties (RAS: 0.651, MUT: 0.610, KD: 0.710, ALPHA: 0.631
and BETA: 0.641), an alternative view could emerge if candidate
selection is based on effect sizes. For this reason, we calculated the
[2 —norm for each column in the alignment using the (standardized)
effect sizes. Three peaks were signiﬁcant as shown in Figure 4,
corresponding to positions 96—98, 374—376 and 510—514. The
change in RAS in region 374—376 is noteworthy, and the change
in all properties for column 376 is of particular interest (Table 2).
Residues at position 510 in the alignment showed an increase
in RAS together with a decrease of hydropathy in pathogenic
organisms. While the effect sizes of known reported cases are bigger
than that observed in our case (e.g. Marjuki et al., 2010), it is
worth mentioning that we are detecting weaker signals present in a
large number of organisms spread across very distant phylogenetic
groups, hence smaller effect sizes are, in fact, expected. The RAS
and mutability are consistently larger in pathogenic organisms
as compared with their non—pathogenic counterpart. Furthermore,
given the observed pattern we analyzed the mean RAS per organism
with a linear mixed model and found a signiﬁcant difference
between pathogens and non—pathogens (mean difference 0.364, 95%
conﬁdence interval 0.161—0.568; data not shown). Additionally, for
pathogens high mutability may constitute a selective advantage,
e. g. to cope with a changing host environment. The behavior of other
properties is more erratic, with increases and decreases alternating
across the protein sequence.

Several points in our approach are worthy of discussion. First, the
amino acid properties are usually limited to 20 possible values. In
general, they are measured in a continuous scale, but the limited set
of values (few amino acids are in each site in the alignment) suggests
that a categorical representation is an interesting alternative.
However, even with discrete data, the simple linear mixed model
performs almost equivalent to more complex models based on
generalized mixed model theory, with the enormous advantage of
the simplicity for interpretation (Peﬁagaricano et al., 2011). Second,
while we focused our analysis on the ‘ﬁxed effects’, essentially the
difference in the properties between pathogens and non—pathogens,
the ‘random effects’ and particularly ‘additive effects’ carry very
important information regarding tendencies along the phylogenetic
structure. Third, phylogenetic heritability (I12) is a key component
in the PMM. Heritability, usually deﬁned as the proportion of
phenotypic variance attributable to ‘additive effects’, indicates the
importance of the phylogenetic information with regard to the
estimation process. Values of h2 near 1 indicate that characteristics
are highly dependent on the phylogenetic structure, while values
near 0 indicate independence of the phylogeny. In our case, the
ﬁrst quartile of h2 was >0.75 for all properties, pointing toward
the general importance of taking into account phylogenies in the
linear model. Fourth, the computational performance of our method
is adequate for medium size problems and a two—stage approach
of the PMM can be used to reduce the computational burden.
Moreover, our approach is trivially parallelizable, both in properties

and columns, giving a broad set of possibilities through several
R packages (doMPI, Rmpi, multicore) or even manually splitting
the work. Fifth, our approach is statistical. Faber and coworkers
showed that a change in a single amino acid in a glycoprotein in the
Rabies Virus, the mutation of asparagine at position 194 to lysine,
enhances virulence and virus spread (Faber et al., 2005). However,
such an example would not be suited for our method, because there
are essentially only two observations and then few possibilities to
apply statistics.

Sixth, while we selected ﬁve properties based on our experience,
there are an enormous number of different properties to combine.
However, a large number of different properties are highly correlated
(Kawashima et al., 2008), clustering in only six groups: or and turn
propensities (A), ,8 propensity (B), composition (C), hydrophobicity
(H), physicochemical (P) and other properties (0) (Tomii and
Kanehisa, 1996). Based on this clustering, several choices will
render similar results, identifying the same sites.

Another interesting alternative is to consider pathogenicity as
the dependent variable, while considering all sites’ properties as
predictors. This poses a typical problem of dimensionality, as
there are usually more regressors than observations. However,
some shrinkage techniques such as the Bayesian LASSO (de los
Campos et al., 2009; Park and Casella, 2008) can accommodate
the dimensionality issue, producing stronger shrinkage of regression
coefﬁcients that are close to zero and less shrinkage of those with
large absolute values. Major caveats with this approach are the
potential overlooking of very similar sites and the difﬁculty in results
interpretation as the Bayesian LASSO is well suited for dependent
variable prediction, while our aim is identiﬁcation of relevant sites.
However, the possibilities this approach raises deserve further work.

Our approach helps to efﬁciently identify relevant columns in an
alignment that might be associated with the label of the organisms
considered, based on relevant amino acid properties. It could
be argued that columns in an alignment coevolve, and are not
independent from each other, so one should consider this when
searching for signiﬁcant positions. Even though we implemented
the R package considering only a univariate model (columns being
independent), it is easily extendable to bivariate (two columns)
models. Coevolution might be incorporated that way. Furthermore,
multivariate models are straightforward to implement under this
framework. Complete regions might be considered via a ‘repeated
measure model’, though at the cost of increased computing time.
Even though we applied this method to examples with two organism
labels, it is extendable to multiclass labels, and not limited to the
case of pathogen/non—pathogen. The ability of the proposed method
to cope with different scenarios lies in its ﬂexibility.

5 CONCLUSION

We present a method based on PMM and amino acid characteristics
that helps ﬁnding ‘interesting’ columns in a protein sequence
alignment, which might be responsible for a structural change in a
protein, possibly affecting its function. We presented an example of
this method through an alignment of bacterial RpoS sequences, using
ﬁve amino acid properties in order to distinguish which columns
could be associated with the pathogenic character of some strains.
Our method is extremely ﬂexible and can be applied to all kinds
of labels, univariate or multivariate, and even taking account of
several effects together. Although we mainly explored the ﬁxed

effects, a lot of additional possibilities can be exploited from random
effects. In the present work, we presented one variant of all these
possibilities and implemented it as an R package.

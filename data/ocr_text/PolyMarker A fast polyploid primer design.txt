Abstract

Summary: The design of genetic markers is of particular relevance in crop breeding programs.
Despite many economically important crops being polyploid organisms, the current primer design
tools are tailored for diploid species. Bread wheat, for instance, is a hexaploid comprising of three
related genomes and the performance of genetic markers is diminished if the primers are not gen-
ome specific. PolyMarker is a pipeline that generates SNP markers by selecting candidate primers
for a specified genome using local alignments and standard primer design tools to test the viability
of the primers. A command line tool and a web interface are available to the community.

Availability and implementation: PolyMarker is available as a ruby BioGem: bio—polyploid—

tools. Web interface: http://polymarker.tgac.ac.uk.

1 Introduction

Breeding programs rely on dense genetic maps with markers (e.g.
SNPs) that can be used to identify the presence or absence of specific
alleles in homozygous or heterozygous state. Standard primer design
tools are designed to work in diploids, where genome duplications
are rare. Wheat is a polyploid composed of three genomes (A, B and
D; referred to as homoeologues) that are related (between 96 and
98% sequence identity), yet distinct. This creates a problem for the
design of PCR primers specific to an individual homoeologue. A
common approach to circumvent this issue is to manually design pri-
mers with a genome specific variant at the 3’ of the primer to in-
crease specificity. We introduce PolyMarker, a tool to automate the
design of genome specific primers, thereby reducing the time in-
vested in this process. To make PolyMarker accessible to scientists
and breeders, we developed a web server where custom SNPs can be
submitted for the design of genome specific assays.

2 Description of the tool

First, PolyMarker converts the input marker information (chromo-
some arm, sequence adjacent to the SNP and parental alleles) into a

fasta file with the sequences that can be queried to the genomic ref-
erence. The search is performed with Exonerate (Slater and Birney,
2005), with the option —ryo (roll your own format) to facilitate the
parsing. The region flanking the SNP, twice the size of the maximum
amplification product (200 bp for amplification products up to
100 bp), on the best hit of each chromosome is extracted. A local
alignment between homoeologues and paralogues, is refined with
MAFFT (Katoh and Standley, 2013), executed using the binder pro-
vided in bioruby.

The local alignment is used to produce a mask containing
all the variations across homoeologues and the input sequence
(Supplementary Fig. 51). The mask indicates the type of variation on
each position: (i) Specific: homoeologous polymorphism which is
only present in the target genome; (ii) Semi-specific: homoeologous
polymorphism which is found in more than one genome but it dis-
criminates against one of the off-target genomes or when not all the
homoeologous sequences were found; (iii) Non-specific: when no
variation is found across homoeologues; (iv) Homoeologous: The
target SNP is present across different chromosomes and; (v) Non-
homoeologous: The target SNP is not present across chromosomes.
PolyMarker default is to design a three-primer assay for KASP

genotyping (LGC Genomics, 2013), that comprises a common pri-
mer and two allele-specific primers. Since the allele-specific primers
are restricted in position, the common primer is used to incorporate
the chromosome specific variants when possible.

To test if the primer candidates are viable Primer3 (Rozen and
Skaletsky, 2000) is invoked using the genomic reference of the target
chromosome. The starting positions of the primers to distinguish be-
tween alleles is selected with the SEQUENCE_FORCE_LEFT_END
option of primer3. To design the common primer the option
SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END is used on two runs of primer3, for
the chromosome specific and semi-specific primers. A final run of pri-
mer3 is executed without the SEQUENCE_FORCE_RIGHT_END op-
tion to find viable primers. After the primers are tested with Primer3,
PolyMarker selects a primer pair with the highest specificity.

PolyMarker is a pipeline (Fig. 1) written as a Biogem (Bonnal
et al., 2012), extending bioruby (Goto et al., 2010) to extract re-
gions from fasta files and to support operations on nucleotide se-
quences with IUPAC ambiguity codes (Cornish-Bowden, 1985).

2.1 Web interface

Our objective was to make PolyMarker accessible via a web inter-
face where breeders and researchers could submit their markers to
custom-design genome-specific SNP assays. A typical output is
described in the supplemental material. Batch submission of several
markers is possible. The web interface is implemented in java with
MySQL database the markers information. The source code of the
web interface and the daemon are available for the community to
set up a private server.

2.2 Example results

The pipeline was developed originally to design KASP assays to
validate putative SNPs from RNA-Seq data [28 out of 35 assays
polymorphic (80%; Ramirez-Gonzalez et al., 2014)]. PolyMarker
was also used to generate KASP assays for the 81 587 markers in the
iSelect array from Wang et al. (2014) (Supplemental Material).

3 Summary

PolyMarker is a pipeline that facilitates the design of primers in poly-
ploid organisms. A web interface is available to design primers for

hexaploid wheat. The use of PolyMarker reduces the time spent de-
signing genome specific assays and highlighting homoeologous SNPs.

Abstract

Motivation: Depletion of loss-of-function (LoF) mutations may provide a rank of genic functional in-

tolerance and consequently susceptibility to disease.

Results: Here we have studied LoF mutations in 60706 unrelated individuals and show that the
most intolerant quartile of ranked genes is enriched in rare and early onset diseases and explains
87% of de novo haploinsufficient OMIM mutations, 17% more than any other gene scoring tool.
We detected particular enrichment in expression of the depleted LoF genes in brain (odds
ratio = 1.5; P-value = 4.2e—07). By searching for de novo haploinsufficient mutations putatively asso-
ciated with neurodevelopmental disorders in four recent studies, we were able to explain 81% of
them. Taken together, this study provides a novel gene intolerance ranking system, called LoFtool,
which may help in ranking genes of interest based on their LoF intolerance and tissue expression.
Availability and implementation: The LoFtool gene scores are available in the Supplementary data.

1 Introduction

Next generation sequencing technology has generated a vast amount of
genomic data, but for clinical applications, interpretability of the results
remains a major challenge. Whole exome sequencing has recently
started to detect variants related to rare Mendelian and complex dis-
eases, usually in a trio setting where both the patient and the parents
are exome sequenced in order to identify de novo disease-associated
mutations (Allen et al., 2013; Fromer et al., 2014; Neale et al., 2012;
Zaidi et al., 2013; Zhang, 2014). Presently several tools exist to predict
a single variant’s pathogenicity, like PolyPhen (Adzhubei et al., 2013)
and SIFT (Ng and Henikoff, 2003), but they do not extrapolate their
predictions to the gene level. There are also tools that prioritize candi-
date disease-causing genes such as ENDEAVOUR (Tranchevent et al.,
2008) or Prioritizer (Franke et al., 2006), but these need a priori genetic
knowledge of the disease. Recently, a new set of tools that prioritize
candidate disease-causing genes with no a priori disease knowledge has
emerged. By using the whole exome sequences of 6503 individuals,

from the NHLBI GO Exome Sequencing Project (ESP) (Tennessen
et al., 2012), Petrovski et al. (2013) devised a ‘residual variance intoler-
ance score’ (RVIS) from common missense and loss-of—function (LoF)
variants versus total number of protein coding variants regardless of
their frequency in the ESP population. A complementary approach for
gene-level prioritization of disease genes calibrates de novo mutation
rates per gene based on exome-sequenced trios in order to prioritize real
excess of de novo mutations (Samocha et al., 2014). EvoTol (Rackham
et al., 2015), another gene score, measures the gene’s intolerance to mu-
tations using evolutionary conservation of protein sequences. Here we
developed an alternative gene score method called LoFtool, based on
the mutation patterns in the exomes of 60 706 unrelated individuals
from the Exome Aggregation Consortium (ExAC) dataset (http://exac.
broadinstitute.orgl). Although LoF intolerance is not a synonym of gen-
eral intolerance, LoF mutations have the greatest pathogenic potential
and hence are a good proxy for general genic intolerance to functional

variation. LoFtool is based on the ratio of LoF to synonymous muta-
tions for each gene, adjusting for the gene de novo mutation rate and
evolutionary protein conservation (Section 2). We evaluate LoFtool
against RVIS (Petrovski. et al., 2013), Z—score (Samocha et al., 2014)
and EvoTol (Rackham et al., 2015), and show that it clearly outper-
forms them in identifying de novo haploinsufficient disease-causing
genes from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) data-
base (Hamosh et al., 2005), and from studies of neurodevelopmental
disorders (Lee et al., 2014; Soden et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2015;
Yang et al., 2014).

2 Methods

The LoFtool gene score. Our method to prioritize candidate disease-
causing genes is based on the Exome Aggregation Consortium
(ExAC) dataset (http://exac.broadinstitute.orgl). This dataset com-
prises exome sequencing data for 60 706 unrelated individuals from
several studies, reprocessed and jointly variant-called with the same
analysis pipeline. We retrieved from ExAC all the synonymous and
high confident LoF mutations called as such with the LOFTEE tool
(https://github.com/konradjk/loftee). High confident LoF mutations
were here defined as stop-gained, splice site disrupting and frame-
shift variants that are not: (i) the ancestral allele (across primates),
(ii) in the last 5% of the transcript, (iii) in exons and introns with
non-canonical splice sites around it, (iv) in introns less than 15 bp,
(v) in genes with only a single exon and (vi) in acceptor sites rescued
by in-frame acceptor site. Then for each RefSeq known protein cod-
ing gene (except ribosomal proteins) with a HUGO Gene
Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) name and belonging to the con-
sensus coding sequence (CCDS) transcripts database (Pruitt et al.,
2009) we obtained the ratio of the number of LoF versus synonym-
ous mutations. Afterwards, we corrected for each gene de novo mu-
tation rate by dividing the LoF/synonymous ratio by the -log10 LoF
de novo probability of each gene (Samocha et al., 2014). Then we
multiplied this LoF intolerance percentile by the EvoTol percentile
and obtained a value that was transformed into our final LoFtool in-
tolerance percentile. The genes with the lower LoFtool percentiles
represent the genes that are most intolerant to functional variation
(Supplementary Table S1). We only probed genes that had at least a
10-fold mean coverage in 70% of their CCDS in the ESP database,
and had available EvoTol percentiles to allow comparisons with
RVIS and EvoTol. In total we obtained 14515 genes with LoFtool
scores. Because of the stringent LoF filters applied, we chose not to
further analyze 906 genes with no LoF in 60 706 individuals from
the ExAC database (non-ribosomal RefSeq known protein coding
genes with at least a 10-fold mean exonic coverage in ExAC).
Nevertheless, we report them in Supplementary Table S2 as these
might be enriched in essential genes.

3 Results

3.1 LoFtool discrimination of different kinds of
Mendelian diseases

To assess if LoFtool could differentiate between genes that do or do
not cause Mendelian diseases, we compared the LoFtool percentiles
in the different OMIM gene categories: ‘haploinsufficiency,’ ‘domin-
ant-negative,’ ‘de novo’ disease causing, and ‘recessive’ (as adopted
from Dataset S1 (Petrovski. et al., 2013)). Genes that do not belong
to these categories were defined as non-disease related (‘non
OMIM’). We observed that Mendelian diseases genes have signifi-
cantly lower LoFtool percentiles than non-disease related genes

(Fig. 1), with the strongest associations seen in haploinsufficient and
de novo diseases (Wilcoxon rank sum test P-value = 1.7e — 49 and
1.5 e — 91, respectively).

We also tested the better curated ClinGen haploinsufficient (HI)
gene list available at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/dbvar/
clingenl, although the LoFtool scores from the OMIM HI versus
ClinGen HI genes were not significantly different (P-value = 0.3078,
Wilcoxon rank sum test). In agreement and as a positive control for
this haploinsufficient feature, LoFtool percentiles were also signifi-
cantly lower for genes in chromosome X (P-value = 1.17e — 27,
Wilcoxon rank sum test). This suggests that genes intolerant to func-
tional variation in the human population are more prone to cause
Mendelian diseases than genes that endure functional variation. We
then benchmarked our method against RVIS (Petrovski. et al.,
2013), Z-score (Samocha et al., 2014) and EvoTol (Rackham et al.,
2015) for these different OMIM gene categories, as previously done
to compare RVIS and EvoTol (Rackham et al., 2015). In Figure 2

intolerance quartile is depicted. Overall, LoFtool has similar power
in identifying all Mendelian disease genes as EvoTol (46% LoFtool,
48% EvoTol, 35% RVIS). However, LoFtool is better in identifying
de novo, haploinsufficient and dominant negative OMIM muta-
tions, with a clear superior performance for the de novo haploinsuf-
ficient genes, 87% of which were detected by LoFtool compared
with 70% by Z-score, 65% by EvoTol and 60% by RVIS (Fig. 2).
Despite the fact that online versions of RVIS and Z-score based on
ExAC database already exist (http://chgv.org/GenicIntolerancel,
ftp://ftp.broadinstitute.org/pub/ExAC_release/release0.3/), their
ExAC scores are very much similar to their original scores here
tested.

To test whether LoFtool is better at predicting early or late onset
diseases with autosomal dominant mode of inheritance we analyzed
a hand-curated version of OMIM that has information about disease
age of onset (Blekhman et al., 2008). As can be seen for the most in-
tolerant genes quartile (25%) in Supplementary Figure S1, the ear-
lier the age at onset of disease the better is the predictive value of
LoFtool, particularly before the age of reproduction (Fisher’s Exact
Test P-value = 4.72e — 12, odds ratio = 3.1). Since LoFtool excels in
identifying de novo haploinsufficient mutations with relatively early
age of onset, we hypothesized that the LoFtool gene score would be
enriched in predicting rare diseases. To test this, we extracted genes
from the ClinVar database where the gene mutation is classified by
the Office of Rare Diseases Research at NIH (Landrum et al., 2014).
LoFtool’s most intolerant gene quartile was enriched in rare disease
genes (Fisher’s Exact Test P-value = 9.9e — 34, odds ratio 22.1),
suggesting that it could be helpful in ranking new rare Mendelian
disease genes. Moreover, LoFtool percentiles were also significantly
lower for genes that produce lethal knockout mouse lines from the
International Mouse Phenotype Consortium (Brown and Moore,
2012) (P-value = 4.2e — 18, Wilcoxon rank sum test). Taken to-
gether, this is in line with LoFtool’s intolerance to functional vari-
ation, with consequent deleterious effect on fitness.

3.2 Enrichment of expression in brain and in genes
causing neurodevelopmental disorders

We then asked if the most intolerant LoFtool genes showed enriched
expression in any human tissue by exploring the Genotype-Tissue
Expression project database (GTEx Consortium, 2015), which pro-
vides a comprehensive atlas of gene expression in different human
tissues. For each of the 14 515 genes with LoFtool scores we com-
puted if any of those were particularly expressed in a specific tissue
(non-sex related tissue with minimum of 30 samples), defined as
being at least 3 times more expressed than in any other tissue
(Supplementary Table S1). As expression of the most intolerant
LoFtool quartile was enriched in brain (Fisher’s Exact Test P-value
= 4.2e — 07, odds ratio = 1.5), we tested whether LoFtool would be
a good ranking classifier of genes involved in neurodevelopmental
disease. To do this we analyzed all de novo haploinsufficient genes
from four recent large studies with exome sequencing data in cases
(mostly trios) with neurodevelopmental disorders (Lee H et al.,
2014; Soden et al., 2014; Wright et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014)
(Supplementary Table S3). The most intolerant LoFtool quartile of
ranked genes explained 81% of these genes (ROC AUC=0.86),
while Z-score explained 84% (ROC AUC = 0.87), RVIS 64% (ROC
AUC = 0.80) and EvoTol 54% (ROC AUC = 0.64) (Fig. 3). Z-score
(AUC = 0.87) seems to perform slightly better that LoFtool
(AUC = 0.86) in the capability to predict de novo haploinsufficient
genes associated with neurodevelopmental disorders, although this

2015; Soden et al., 2014)

difference is not statistical significance (P-value = 0.5808, Wilcoxon
rank sum test).

Moreover, the most intolerant LoFtool quartile was also en-
riched in previous independently reported extreme de novo muta-
tions in neurodevelopmental disorders, as stored in NPdenovo
database (Li et al., 2015) (Fisher’s Exact Test P-value=2.3e— 3,
odds ratio = 1.9). Most importantly, LoFtool have significantly
lower scores (more intolerant) for genes associated with diseases re-
ported in the NPdenovo database versus the respective controls, giv-
ing validity to LoFtool’s performance. LoFtool performs the best
when comparing its gene score percentile of controls versus autism
(P-value = 0.004, Wilcoxon rank sum test) and controls versus
schizophrenia (P-value = 6.45e — 05, Wilcoxon rank sum test),
while it is second when comparing its gene score percentile of con-
trols versus epileptic encephalopathy and intellectual disability, after
Samocha’s Z-score (Supplementary Fig. 52).

4 Discussion

We have shown that LoFtool discriminates between genes that do
and do not cause disease (mostly early onset), outperforming other
state-of—the-art gene scoring methods. LoFtool predicts genome-
wide de novo haploinsufficient mutations accurately and could be of
help in search for genetic causes of rare Mendelian diseases.
Moreover, its brain expression enrichment coupled to a ROC AUC
of 0.86 in detecting neurodevelopmental disorder genes makes
LoFtool also an attractive method for investigating complex brain
diseases with strong genetic effects. In addition, our LoFtool score
has already been adopted by popular variant annotation tools like
ANNOVAR, Sanff, deSFP, UCSC Genome Browser Variant
Integrator and Ensembl Variant Effect Predictor (Cingolani et al.,
2012; Karolchik et al, 2014; Liu et al, 2013; McLaren et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2010), which highlights the wide applicability of our
gene intolerance score. Future work could focus on functional pro-
tein domains, rather than the overall gene mutation burden, in order
to more easily prioritize the avalanche of rare variants putatively

associated with a phenotype of interest (Lee et al., 2014). Taken to-
gether, this study provides a novel gene intolerance ranking system
that ranks genes based on their loss-of-function intolerance and tis-
sue expression specificity.

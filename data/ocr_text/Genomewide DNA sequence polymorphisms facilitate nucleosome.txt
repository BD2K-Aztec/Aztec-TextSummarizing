ABSTRACT

Motivation: The intrinsic DNA sequence is an important determinant
of nucleosome positioning. Some DNA sequence patterns can
facilitate nucleosome formation, while others can inhibit nucleosome
formation. Nucleosome positioning influences the overall rate of
sequence evolution. However, its impacts on specific patterns of
sequence evolution are still poorly understood.

Results: Here, we examined whether nucleosomal DNA and
nucleosome-depleted DNA show distinct polymorphism patterns to
maintain adequate nucleosome architecture on a genome scale in
yeast. We found that sequence polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA
tend to facilitate nucleosome formation, whereas polymorphisms in
nucleosome-depleted DNA tend to inhibit nucleosome formation,
which is especially evident at nucleosome-disfavored sequences
in nucleosome-free regions at both ends of genes. Sequence
polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome positioning correspond
to stable nucleosome positioning. These results reveal that
sequence polymorphisms are under selective constraints to maintain
nucleosome positioning.

1 INTRODUCTION

The nucleosome is the fundamental unit of eukaryotic chromatin,
which consists of a histone octamer around which a stretch
of 147 bp DNA is wrapped. Most of the DNA is wrapped in
nucleosomes, with adjacent nucleosomes generally separated by
~20—50 bp of unwrapped linker DNA. The nucleosome limits
the accessibility of nucleosomal DNA to regulatory DNA—binding
proteins. Nucleosome positioning thus plays an essential role in the
regulation of diverse cellular processes, including DNA replication,
recombination, repair, transcription, chromosome segregation and
cell division. Nucleosome positioning is determined by multiple
factors, including the intrinsic DNA sequence, DNA methylation,
histone variants, post—translational modiﬁcations, transcription
factors and chromatin remodelers (Segal and Widom, 2009).
Sequence evolution can be under selection to facilitate
speciﬁc cellular processes. There is evidence for selection on
synonymous codons required for accurate translation (Akashi, 2003;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Stoletzki and Eyre—Walker, 2007). Sequence patterns in exons are
also under selection to facilitate correct splicing (Parmley and Hurst,
2007; Zhang et al., 2008). Genome—wide analysis on nucleosome
positioning in yeast has revealed that linker DNA evolves more
slowly than nucleosomal DNA (Warnecke et al., 2008; Washietl
et al., 2008). A possible explanation is that nucleosomes occlude
the DNA from access to most DNA repair proteins, resulting in low
repair efﬁciency in nucleosomal DNA (Ataian and Krebs, 2006;
Thoma, 2005).

Experimental evidence indicates that DNA sequences differ
greatly in their abilities to bend and twist (Widom, 2001).
Consequently, some DNA sequence patterns facilitate nucleosome
formation, whereas others distort nucleosome formation (Field
at al., 2008). The intrinsic DNA sequence is one dominant factor
responsible for nucleosome positioning (Segal et al., 2006). Linker
DNA—based nucleosome depletion signals have been shown to be
more critical for nucleosome positioning than nucleosome formation
signals (Peckham et al., 2007; Yuan and Liu, 2008). An alternative
explanation for the slower sequence evolution rates of linker DNA is
that the extent of sequence evolution in linker DNA is under selection
to maintain the nucleosomal organization. Although the impact of
nucleosome positioning on the overall rate of sequence evolution is
clear, its impacts on speciﬁc patterns of sequence evolution remain
to be elucidated.

In this study, we investigated into the relationship between
nucleosome positioning and nucleotide polymorphism patterns
within Saccharomyces cerevisiae populations. We analyzed genome—
wide single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) data in S.cerevisiae
populations. We found distinct polymorphism biases between
nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome—depleted DNA. Polymorphism
patterns that facilitate nucleosome formation are preferred in
nucleosomal DNA, while polymorphism patterns with nucleosome—
excluding properties are favored in nucleosome—depleted DNA.
We also found that nucleotide polymorphism patterns that
facilitate nucleosome positioning correspond to stable nucleosome
positioning.

2 METHODS

We used the genome—wide resequencing dataset of 38 aligned strains
of S.cerevisiae that were generated by the Saccharomyces Genome
Resequencing Project (Liti et al., 2009). These strains were sampled from
different ecological niches and from locations on different continents.
These strains include lab, pathogenic, baking, wine, food spoilage, natural
fermentation, sake, probiotic and plant isolates. These data were collected by
a combination of ABI and Illumina GA (Solexa) sequencing, which detected
a total of 2 125 945 high—quality individual SNPs, which were grouped into

DNA polymorphisms and nucleosome positioning

 

235 127 distinct sites in the reference strain S288c. There are 12 possible
nucleotide polymorphism types relative to the reference strain (i.e. A—> C,
A—> G, A—>T, C—>A, C—>G, C—>T, G—>A, G—> C, G—>T, T—>A,
T —> C, T —> G). For each of SNP sites, there are three possible polymorphism
types relative to the reference strain.

We used the genome—wide nucleosome positioning dataset of S.cerevisiae
that were generated by Chip—Seq (Mavrich et al., 2008). A total of 53 026
nucleosome locations were identiﬁed by at least three sequencing reads of
>100 bp each. We also used other three independent datasets of nucleosome
positioning (Lee et al., 2007; Shivaswamy et al., 2008; Whitehouse et al.,
2007) to test the robustness to choice of datasets, which contain 70 868,
49 043 and 63 026 nucleosomes, respectively (see Supplementary Table SI
for the summary of nucleosome positioning data). The reference strain is the
strain on which nucleosome locations were measured. The main results in
this study were tested on each of the four independent datasets of nucleosome
positioning, and could be reproduced on each of the four datasets. The main
conclusions in this study are robust to the choice of datasets.

For most genes, there is a wide nucleosome—free region (NFR) at their
both 5/ ends and 3/ ends. These NFRs play important roles in nucleosome
positioning in gene bodies (Mavrich et al., 2008). We classiﬁed genome—
wide nucleosome—depleted regions as 5/ end NFR, 3/ end NFR and linker
DNA. The 5/ end NFR was deﬁned as the ﬁrst nucleosome—depleted region
immediately upstream of transcription start site (TSS). The 3/ end NFR was
deﬁned as the ﬁrst nucleosome—depleted region immediately downstream of
transcription termination site. Linker DNA was deﬁned as the nucleosome—
depleted regions except 5/ end NFR and 3/ end NFR. We classiﬁed every
SNP site into four categories according to its location, including nucleosomal
DNA SNP, 5/ end NFR SNP, 3/ end NFR SNP and linker DNA SNP (see
Supplementary Table SI for the frequency and density of each category of
SNPs).

Nucleosome fuzziness was measured by the SD of sequencing read
locations that deﬁne each nucleosome position (Mavrich et al., 2008).
Nucleosome fuzziness is a measure of how delocalized or spread out a
nucleosome position is. We calculated for each promoter or each coding
region the average fuzziness of its nucleosomes. We compared genes where
most nucleotide polymorphisms on promoters (or coding regions) facilitate
nucleosome positioning with the other genes in terms of their average
nucleosome fuzziness. Promoter region was deﬁned as the region 455 bp
upstream of TSS (the upstream region was truncated if it overlapped with
neighboring genes). This threshold was chosen according to the observation
that the median intergenic distance in S.cerevisiae is 455 bp (Kristiansson
et 61]., 2009).

We used linker DNA potential (LDP) data of every one of the 1024
possible sequences of length 5 (i.e. 5mers). Genome—wide occupancy of
nucleosomes assembled on puriﬁed yeast genomic DNA was measured by
Kaplan et al. (2009). This in vitro nucleosome map is determined only by
the intrinsic sequence preferences of nucleosomes. For each 5mer, they
calculated the reciprocal of the average in vitro nucleosome occupancy
across all its instances in the map, where this reciprocal average occupancy
is then scaled to a probability by dividing it by the sum of all such
reciprocal occupancies across all 5mers. The resulting values range from
6.74><10_4 (for 5mer GCAGC) to 1.48 ><10_3 (for 5mer AAAAA). We
termed these resulting values as LDP. The nucleosome—disfavored sequences
have relatively high LDP and the nucleosome—favored sequences have
relatively low LDP. The nucleosome occupancy predicted by the model using
the LDP of 5mers alone shows per—base pair correlation of 0.876 with in vivo
nucleosome occupancy data (Kaplan et al., 2009). This result demonstrates
that the LDP of 5mers is highly representative of the intrinsic sequence
preferences of nucleosomes. High LDP values correspond to high sequence
preferences of nucleosome depletion, whereas low LDP values correspond
to high sequence preferences of nucleosome formation.

Gene coordinate data were downloaded from the Saccharomyces Genome
Database (http://www.yeastgen0me.org). Using this data, we distinguished
coding regions from non—coding regions. The TSS data was taken from David

et al. (2006). Transcription factor binding data was taken from Harbison et al.
(2004), which includes the indentiﬁed exact binding sites at promoters for
each transcription factor. A P—value cutoff of 0.001 was used to deﬁne the set
of genes bound by a particular transcription factor. The dataset includes 9678
binding sites for 101 transcription factors. Using these data, we identiﬁed
SNP sites that are in the transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) for a
separate analysis.

3 RESULTS
3.1 LDP of polymorphisms

We mainly used three types of datasets. First, we used the genome—
wide nucleosome positioning dataset of S.cerevisiae in which a
total of 53 026 nucleosome locations were identiﬁed (Mavrich
et al., 2008). Second, we used the SNP data from 38 aligned
strains of S.cerevisiae (Liti et al., 2009). A total of 2125 945
high—quality individual SNPs relative to the reference strain S288c
were identiﬁed, which were grouped into 235127 distinct sites
on the reference strain. The reference strain is the strain on
which nucleosome locations were measured (Mavrich et al., 2008).
Assuming that nucleosome positioning should be evolutionarily
conserved among strains, we could use the nucleosome positioning
data on the reference strain to study the impacts of nucleosome
positioning on sequence polymorphisms that are relative to the
reference strain. This assumption is reasonable as only ~10% of
the nucleosome positioning shows divergence between S. cerevisiae
and Sparadoxus (Tirosh et al., 2010; Tsankov et al., 2010),
and nucleosome divergence should be lower among strains of
S.cerevisiae. Third, we used LDP data of every one of the 1024
possible 5mers (Kaplan et al., 2009). High LDP values correspond
to high sequence preferences of nucleosome depletion, whereas low
LDP values correspond to high sequence preferences of nucleosome
formation (see Section 2 for details).

For one 5mer, there are three possible polymorphism types
relative to the reference strain at each position (see the example 5mer
AGGCT in Fig. 1). The 5mer can be converted into other 15 possible
5mers through SNP These possible 5mers differ in their LDP values
(I in Fig. 1 is for LDP values of the 15 possible 5mers). Considering
all non—reference strains, we counted the number for each of three
possible polymorphism types relative to the reference strain at each
SNP site, respectively. For each of the 1024 5mers, we detected all
its instances that cover SNP sites across the genome, and classiﬁed
these instances into four categories according to their locations,
including nucleosomal DNA instances, 5’ end NFR instances, 3’ end
NFR instances and linker DNA instances (see Section 2). For each
category of one 5mer, we summed up the above counted numbers
for each of the three possible polymorphism types at each of the
ﬁve positions from all its instances (Cn for nucleosomal DNA in
Fig. 1, the index n represents nucleosomal DNA), and calculated
the nucleotide polymorphism frequency (fn for nucleosomal DNA
in Fig. 1).

f0,i)=C(i,i)/(C(1,i)+--'+C(4,i)) (1)

Take the ﬁrst column in fn of the 5mer AGGCT in Figure 1 for
example, considering all instances covering SNP sites, at the ﬁrst
position, 10% of the nucleotide polymorphisms in nucleosomal
DNA are from base A to base C (from 5mer AGGCT to CGGCT),
77% of the nucleotide polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA are

Fig. 1. The calculation of LDP of polymorphisms for one example 5mer
AGGCT. This is an example for nucleosomal DNA. The same procedure
is carried out for the other three categories: 5/ end NFR, 3/ end NFR and
linker DNA. The 5mer AGGCT can be converted into other 15 possible
5mers through SNP. These 5mers differ in their LDP values. We counted the
numbers for each polymorphism type at each of the ﬁve positions from all its
instances, and calculated the nucleotide polymorphism frequency. We also
calculated background nucleotide polymorphism frequency relative to the
reference strain for all SNPs. The value in the background frequency matrix
represents the frequency of polymorphism from the column—indicated base
(reference strain) to the row—indicated base. LDP values of polymorphisms
were calculated in nucleosomal DNA Ln and background Lb, respectively.
Ln were normalized by LDP value of the original 5mer and L1,. These
normalized LDP values are independent of the LDP value of the original
5mer before nucleotide polymorphism, and are only dependent of nucleotide
polymorphism frequency values and the LDP values of the corresponding
5mers that are converted into. They represent the changing trends of
nucleotide polymorphism towards high LDP values compared to those of
background polymorphisms.

from base A to base G (from 5mer AGGCT to GGGCT) and
13% of the nucleotide polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA are
from base A to base T (from 5mer AGGCT to TGGCT). The
nucleotide polymorphism frequency corresponds to each of the 15
possible 5mers that are converted into. We multiplied the nucleotide
polymorphism frequency by the LDP value of the corresponding
5mer after polymorphism, and termed the summation of the three
resulting values at each position as LDP of nucleotide polymorphism
(Ln for nucleosomal DNA in Fig. 1).

L(i)=l(1,i)Xf(1,i)—l—-~~—l—l(4,i)Xf(4,i) (2)

As similar sequence patterns show similar preferences of
nucleosomes (Kaplan et al., 2009), the LDP values of nucleotide
polymorphism should be partly dependent on the LDP value of
the original 5mer before polymorphism. To control for this effect,
we divided LDP values of nucleotide polymorphism by LDP
value of the original 5mer (8.93 X 10‘4 for the example 5mer
AGGCT in Fig. 1). The resulting values represent the changing
trends of LDP of nucleotide polymorphism. However, the resulting
LDP values of nucleotide polymorphism might be confounded
by genome—wide background nucleotide polymorphisms. First, if
LDP values of nucleotide polymorphism in nucleosomal DNA for
one 5mer are as high as those in nucleosome—depleted DNA, it
indicates that the changing trend towards high LDP values of

nucleotide polymorphism is just a general feature of genome—
wide background nucleotide polymorphisms, not characteristic to
nucleotide polymorphisms in nucleosome—depleted DNA. Second,
for one 5mer with extremely high or low LDP value, the LDP
values of 5mers converted into through SNP are more likely to
be lower or higher compared with the original LDP value. To
evaluate whether polymorphisms facilitate or inhibit nucleosome
positioning, we should compare changing trends of LDP values of
nucleotide polymorphisms to those of background polymorphisms,
that is, to compare LDP of nucleotide polymorphism with those of
genome—wide background nucleotide polymorphisms. Considering
the two points above, we next normalized LDP of nucleotide
polymorphism by genome—wide background levels (Fig. 1). We
calculated nucleotide polymorphism frequency relative to the
reference strain for all 2125 945 SNPs (B in Fig. 1). Using
these universal background polymorphism frequency values and
the corresponding LDP values, we calculated LDP of background
nucleotide polymorphism for each 5mer as the method above
[Equation (2)]. We divided LDP values of nucleotide polymorphism
(Ln, Ll, L5NFR, L3NFR) for each 5mer by those of background
polymorphisms (Lb) (Fig. 1). These normalized LDP values are
independent of the LDP value of the original 5mer before nucleotide
polymorphism, and are only dependent of nucleotide polymorphism
frequency values and the LDP value of the corresponding 5mers that
are converted into. They represent the changing trends of LDP values
of nucleotide polymorphisms compared with those of background
polymorphisms. In the following analysis, we termed the normalized
LDP values of nucleotide polymorphisms as LDP of polymorphisms.

3.2 Distinct LDP values of polymorphisms between
nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome-depleted DNA

We examined whether the polymorphisms on non—reference strains
are under constraints to maintain the nucleosome organization on
the reference strain. If this is the case, the polymorphism types
that facilitate nucleosome positioning should be favored, that is,
polymorphism types that facilitate nucleosome formation should
be favored in nucleosomal DNA, and polymorphism types that
facilitate nucleosome depletion should be favored in nucleosome—
depleted DNA. The instances of one 5mer should show different
LDP values of polymorphisms between nucleosomal DNA and
nucleosome—depleted DNA. Considering all 1024 5mers (5 LDP
values of polymorphisms per 5mer, a total of 5120 values), LDP
of polymorphisms in nucleosome—depleted DNA are signiﬁcantly
higher than those of nucleosomal DNA (Mann—Whitney U —test,
P<10T9 for nucleosomal DNA versus linker DNA, P<10T30
for nucleosomal DNA versus 5’ end NFR DNA, P<10_44 for
nucleosomal DNA versus 3’ end NFR DNA, Fig. 2A). To exclude
any potentially unforeseen experimental bias in the nucleosome
data we used, we performed the above analysis on another three
independent datasets of nucleosome positioning (Lee et al., 2007;
Shivaswamy et al., 2008; Whitehouse et al., 2007), respectively. We
found that the distinction of LDP values of polymorphisms between
nucleosome—depleted DNA and nucleosomal DNA is robust to the
choice of datasets (Supplementary Fig. S1). To test any potentially
artifact caused by the choice of reference strain, we performed the
analysis above using reference nucleotide instead of reference strain.
For every SNP site, we identiﬁed the most conserved nucleotide
among all strains as the reference nucleotide, and calculated

the frequency of each of the three possible polymorphism types
relative to the reference nucleotide, respectively. For SNP sites
with more than one nucleotide being the most conserved, we
chose one at random. We reasoned that the conserved nucleotides
should correspond to the conserved nucleosome positioning, and
we could test whether polymorphisms relative to the conserved
nucleotides facilitate the conserved nucleosome positioning. We
found that LDP of polymorphisms in nucleosome—depleted DNA

are still signiﬁcantly higher than those of nucleosomal DNA
(Mann—Whitney U —test, P<10T10 for nucleosomal DNA versus
linker DNA, P < 10‘29 for nucleosomal DNA versus 5’ end NFR
DNA, P <10—35 for nucleosomal DNA versus 3’ end NFR DNA,
Supplementary Fig. S2).

We further tested the distinction of LDP values of polymorphisms
between nucleosome—depleted DNA and nucleosomal DNA.
Nucleotide polymorphisms in coding regions are under selection to
maintain speciﬁc functions. Although nucleotide polymorphisms are
generally assumed to occur more or less independently of selection
in non—coding regions, TFBSs tend to be evolutionarily conserved
to guarantee transcription factor binding. We distinguished coding
regions from non—coding regions using gene coordinate data, and
used the genome—wide dataset of 9678 binding sites for 101
transcription factors (Harbison et al., 2004). We repeated the analysis
as above for three types of SNP sites respectively: those in coding
regions, those in TFBSs and the others. Note that as TFBSs lie
upstream of genes, we considered SNPs in TFBSs in terms of only
three categories, including nucleosomal DNA SNPs, 5’ end NFR
SNPs and linker DNA SNPs, but not 3’ end NFR SNPs. In addition,
though NFRs lie at both 5’ end and 3’ end of genes, they still overlap
with coding regions. In other words, some SNP sites in coding region
lie in NFRs. We could thus compare LDP values of polymorphisms
of NFR DNA with those in nucleosomal DNA for SNP sites
in coding regions. For SNPs in coding regions, LDP values of
polymorphisms in nucleosome—depleted DNA are still signiﬁcantly
higher than those of nucleosomal DNA (Mann—Whitney U —test,
P<10T10 for nucleosomal DNA versus linker DNA, P<10T14
for nucleosomal DNA versus 5’ end NFR DNA, P<10_14 for
nucleosomal DNA versus 3’ end NFR DNA, Fig. 2B). Similar
results could be reproduced when excluding SNP sites that are in
coding regions or in TFBSs (Mann—Whitney U —test, P < 10_17 for
nucleosomal DNA versus linker DNA, P < 10‘11 for nucleosomal
DNA versus 5’ end NFR DNA, P< 10‘16 for nucleosomal DNA
versus 3’ end NFR DNA, Fig. 2C). However, for SNPs in TFBSs,
LDP values of polymorphisms in nucleosome—depleted DNA are
comparable with those of nucleosomal DNA (Mann—Whitney
U —test, P = 0.07 for nucleosomal DNA versus linker DNA, P = 0.26
for nucleosomal DNA versus 5’ end NFR DNA, Supplementary
Fig. S3), indicating less constraints of nucleosome positioning on
nucleotide polymorphisms in TFBSs.

We repeated the above analysis by randomly shufﬂing SNP
data and nucleosome positioning data, respectively. If nucleotide
polymorphisms are not under constraints of nucleosome positioning,
the random perturbation on both datasets should not weaken the
distinction of LDP values of polymorphisms between nucleosome—
depleted DNA and nucleosomal DNA, and the statistical signiﬁcance
should be as high as those in realistic SNP data. First, we shufﬂed
the SNP data. Fixing the number of SNPs on each SNP site,
for every SNP, we substituted the nucleotide in the non—reference
strain with the possible three nucleotides at random according
to the nucleotide in the reference strain and the background
polymorphism frequency calculated above (B in Fig. 1). In this
way, we generated a new randomized SNP map. We repeated this
randomized experiment 1000 times, generating a total of 1000
randomized SNP maps. We found that the statistical differences
of LDP values of polymorphisms between nucleosome—depleted
DNA and nucleosomal DNA for all these randomized SNP maps
are weaker than those of realistic SNP data (Fig. 2D). Second,
we shufﬂed the nucleosome positioning data. Fixing the number

of SNP sites for each nucleosomal category (i.e. nucleosomal
DNA, 5’ end NFR, 3’ end NFR and linker DNA), we randomly
shufﬂed the category type for each SNP site. Repeating this
randomized experiment 1000 times, we generated a total of 1000
randomized maps. We found that the statistical differences of LDP
values of polymorphisms between nucleosome—depleted DNA and
nucleosomal DNA for all these randomized SNP maps are weaker
than those of realistic SNP data (Fig. 2E).

Finally, we quantitatively evaluated the constraints of nucleosome
positioning on nucleotide polymorphism. For each polymorphism
type at each position of one 5mer, we examined whether it facilitates
nucleosome positioning or not by comparing its corresponding
LDP value with background level. If l(j,i) is smaller than Lb(i)
in nucleosomal DNA or l(j, i) is higher than Lb(i) in nucleosome—
depleted DNA (Fig. 1), the corresponding polymorphism type
was considered to facilitate nucleosome positioning. Otherwise,
the corresponding polymorphism type was considered to inhibit
nucleosome positioning. We counted the number of sequence
polymorphisms that facilitate or inhibit nucleosome positioning,
which were then subtracted by the corresponding number expected
by the background polymorphism frequency. In this procedure, to
control for the background polymorphism, we only considered those
satisfy f (j,i) > fb(j,i), that is, the counted number must be higher
than the expected number. We found that nucleotide polymorphisms
facilitating nucleosome positioning are more prevalent than those
inhibiting nucleosome positioning, occupying 55.6% of the total.
The fraction value is 55.8 and 55.3%, when we analyze nucleosomal
DNA alone and nucleosome—depleted DNA alone. These results
suggest that both nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome—depleted
DNA are under constraints to facilitate nucleosome positioning. To
evaluate the statistical signiﬁcance of the prevalence of nucleotide
polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome positioning, we repeated the
randomized experiment shufﬂing the SNP data as above 1000 times.
We found that the fraction of sequence polymorphisms facilitating
nucleosome positioning is lower in randomized experiments,
ranging from 47.3% to 51.2% (Fig. 2F). Comparing the number
of sequence polymorphisms that facilitate or inhibit nucleosome
positioning in realistic data with those in randomized experiments,
we found that the prevalence of nucleotide polymorphisms
facilitating nucleosome positioning in realistic data is more
statistically signiﬁcant than those in randomized experiments (P N 0
for each of the 1000 randomized experiments, chi—square test).

Taken together, we observed distinct nucleotide polymorphism
patterns between nucleosomal DNA and nucleosome—depleted
DNA. Polymorphisms that facilitate nucleosome formation are
favored in nucleosomal DNA, whereas polymorphisms that inhibit
nucleosome formation are favored in nucleosome—depleted DNA.

3.3 Sequences with high LDP values in NFR regions
have nucleosome-disfavored polymorphisms

We asked whether some speciﬁc 5mers are under strong constraints
to conserve the nucleosome organization. As stated above, the
LDP values of polymorphisms have been normalized by the initial
LDP values and the LDP values of background polymorphisms.
They represent the changing trends of nucleotide polymorphisms
toward high LDP values compared with those of background
polymorphisms. A high initial LDP value does not necessarily mean
that the LDP value of polymorphisms will be high. As nucleosome—
disfavored sequences in NFR regions have been shown to be more

original LDP values and average LDP values of polymorphisms in 5’ end
NFR. The Spearman correlation and the statistical signiﬁcance of the scatter

critical for nucleosome positioning (Peckham et al., 2007; Yuan and
Liu, 2008), we asked whether sequences with high LDP values in
NFR regions are under strong constraints compared with those with
low LDP values, having nucleosome—disfavored polymorphisms for
the maintenance of nucleosome organization. As LDP values of
polymorphisms of each 5mer is a vector of length 5, we used its
average value (Supplementary Table S2). We found that LDP values
of original 5mers show a signiﬁcantly positive correlation with LDP
values of polymorphisms in both NFR regions (Fig. 3). Similar
positive correlation in both NFR regions can be observed in the
three additional datasets of nucleosome positioning (Supplementary
Figs S4—S6). However, no signiﬁcant correlation between LDP
values of original 5mers and LDP values of polymorphisms was
observed in linker DNA (Supplementary Fig. S7A).

We next asked whether nucleosome—favored sequences in
nucleosomal DNA are under strong constraints compared with
nucleosome—disfavored sequences. We found no signiﬁcant
correlation between LDP values of original 5mers and LDP values
of polymorphisms in nucleosomal DNA (Supplementary Fig. S7B).
These results suggest that nucleosome—favored sequences and
nucleosome—disfavored sequences in nucleosomal DNA are under
comparable constraints to conserve the nucleosome organization.

3.4 Polymorphisms facilitating nucleosome positioning
correspond to stable nucleosome positioning

We tested whether sequence polymorphisms that are under
constraints of nucleosome positioning in turn stabilize nucleosome
positioning. First, we estimated the extent of nucleosome positioning
constraints on sequence polymorphism for each promoter or each

coding region. For each SNP site, we used a method similar as
above to calculate its LDP values of polymorphisms (Supplementary
Fig. S8). We used the average of LDP values of polymorphisms
normalized by those of genome—wide background polymorphisms
to represent the LDP changing trends of nucleotide polymorphism.
If the average resulting value in nucleosomal DNA is smaller
than 1 or that in nucleosome—depleted DNA is higher than 1, this
SNP site was considered to facilitate nucleosome positioning. For
simplicity, we calculated for each promoter or each coding region the
fraction of its nucleotide polymorphisms that facilitate nucleosome
positioning relative to background polymorphisms. We identiﬁed
the top 10% promoters or coding regions with the highest fraction
values as promoters or coding regions with strong nucleosome
positioning constraints on nucleotide polymorphisms. Next, we
used nucleosome fuzziness to represent the degree of stableness
of nucleosome positioning. Nucleosome positioning is not static,
and unstable nucleosome positioning should make the nucleosome
spread out over a broad region along DNA. Nucleosome fuzziness
is a measure of how delocalized or spread out a nucleosome
position is. Low nucleosome fuzziness corresponds to stable
nucleosome positioning. Nucleosome fuzziness data are available
for each nucleosome on the reference strain (Mavrich et al., 2008).
Note that nucleosome fuzziness is not a measure of nucleosome
variation among strains. We calculated for each promoter or each
coding region, the average fuzziness of its nucleosomes. We
found that strong nucleosome positioning constraints on nucleotide
polymorphism correspond to stable nucleosome positioning (i.e. low
nucleosome fuzziness) both in promoters and in coding regions
(the ﬁrst columns in Fig. 4A and B). This correspondence also
exists when we used the top 20% promoters. Similar results can
be reproduced in the three independent datasets of nucleosome
positioning (the second to the fourth columns in Fig. 4A and B).

We next investigated into the relationship between nucleosome
positioning constraints on sequence polymorphisms and gene
expression. Nucleosome positioning in promoter regions controls
the binding of transcription—related proteins to DNA, and thus it
is very critical for gene expression. Variation in gene expression
is linked to changes of nucleosome organization in promoter
regions (Choi and Kim, 2009). We asked whether nucleosome
positioning constraints on nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter
regions are also linked to variation in gene expression. We
used seven measures for expression variability as in a previous
study (Choi and Kim, 2009), including stochastic noise (stn),
responsiveness (res), stress response (str), trans variability (trv),
mutational variance (muv), interstrain variation (isv) and expression
divergence (div). We found that strong nucleosome positioning
constraints on nucleotide polymorphisms in promoter regions
correspond to low variability of gene expression (Fig. 4C). However,
when controlling for nucleosome fuzziness, this correspondence
disappeared (P > 0.05, Mann—Whitney U —test; Supplementary Fig.
S9), suggesting that this correspondence may be caused by the
correspondence between stable nucleosome positioning and low
variability of gene expression.

Fig. 4. Strong constraints of nucleosome positioning on nucleotide
polymorphisms correspond to stable nucleosome positioning. (A) Average
values that correspond to nucleosome fuzziness on promoters are shown
for genes where most nucleotide polymorphisms on promoters facilitate
nucleosome positioning and the other genes. P—values were from Mann—
Whitney U —test. The results are shown for the four independent datasets
of nucleosome positioning, including those of Pugh et al., Lee et al.,
Shivaswamy et al. and Whitehouse et al. Nucleosome fuzziness was used
to represent nucleosome delocalization. Low nucleosome delocalization
corresponds to high nucleosome stability. (B) Same as (A), but for coding

promoters facilitate nucleosome positioning and the other genes. The seven
measures include stochastic noise (stn), responsiveness (res), stress response
(str), trans variability (trv), mutational variance (muv), interstrain variation
(isv) and expression divergence (div). Measures with a pink square on the
bottom are statistically signiﬁcant between the two gene classes (P <0.01,
Mann—Whitney U —test). Values were normalized using the function zscore
in Matlab, such that their means are zero and SDs are one. Error bars were
calculated by bootstrapping.

are favored in nucleosomal regions, whereas those inhibiting
nucleosome formation are biased in nucleosome—depleted regions.
This observation reveals the constraints of nucleosome positioning
on sequence polymorphisms. We estimated that nucleosome
positioning explains ~4% to ~8% more sequence polymorphisms
than is expected by chance (Fig. 2F). Moreover, the proportion
of sequence polymorphisms that can be explained by nucleosome
positioning is comparable between nucleosomal DNA and
nucleosome—depleted DNA, indicating that the constraints
of nucleosome positioning on sequence polymorphisms are
comparable between these two types of DNA.

Nucleosome—disfavored sequences have been shown to play a
more important role in nucleosome positioning compared with
nucleosome—favored sequences (Peckham et al., 2007; Yuan and
Liu, 2008). Speciﬁcally, nucleosome—disfavored sequences in NFRs
set a barrier for nucleosome positioning in gene bodies (Mavrich
et al., 2008). Indeed, we have shown that nucleosome—disfavored
sequences in NFR regions are under strong constraints to have
nucleosome—disfavored polymorphisms, facilitating nucleosome
depletion. On the other hand, in nucleosomal DNA, nucleosome—
favored and nucleosome—disfavored sequences are under similar
constraints to have nucleosome—favored polymorphisms. These
results demonstrate the different constraints of nucleosome
positioning on nucleotide polymorphisms.

The intrinsic genomic sequence is an important determinant
of nucleosome positioning. Nucleosome architecture in promoter
regions is essential to control gene expression. Gene expression
divergence in yeast has been shown to be coupled to evolution
of DNA—encoded nucleosome organization (Field et al., 2009).
We have shown that strong constraints of nucleosome positioning
on sequence polymorphisms correspond to stable nucleosome
positioning and low variability of gene expression (Fig. 4).
We speculated that stable nucleosome positioning imposes
strong constraints on sequence polymorphisms, keeping its
stable positioning. Genes having stable nucleosome positioning
in promoter regions should have relatively constant chromatin
structure. As variation of gene expression should require the
alternation of chromatin structure in promoter regions, genes
having stable nucleosome positioning in promoter regions have low
variability of gene expression.

Although nucleosome positioning is not static, a considerable
fraction of nucleosomes are well—positioned (Lee et al., 2007). These
well—positioned nucleosomes could better limit the accessibility of
DNA regulatory elements compared with delocalized nucleosomes,
preventing inappropriate biological processes from regulatory
protein stochastic binding. We found that strong constraints of
nucleosome positioning on sequence polymorphisms correspond to
stable nucleosome positioning (i.e. well—positioned nucleosomes)
and low variability of gene expression (Fig. 4). The polymorphism
patterns that facilitate nucleosome positioning could help well—
positioned nucleosomes protect DNA regulatory elements, leading
to low variability of gene expression. During DNA—dependent
biological processes (e.g. transcription), regulatory proteins (e.g.
chromatin remodelers) are recruited to reposition nucleosomes to
expose DNA regulatory elements by overriding the underlying
nucleosome positioning DNA signals.

Sequence polymorphism is under constraints of nucleosome
positioning in intergenic regions. As sequence polymorphisms
in these regions are previously assumed to be independent of
constraints, this ﬁnding reveals a new constraint at the DNA
level in these regions. Our results give evidence for the important
roles of DNA in nucleosome positioning, and also facilitate
the understanding of a new selective constraint on sequence
polymorphism on a genome—scale level.

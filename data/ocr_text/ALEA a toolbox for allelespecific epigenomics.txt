ABSTRACT

The assessment of expression and epigenomic status using sequen-
cing based methods provides an unprecedented opportunity to iden-
tify and correlate allelic differences with epigenomic status. We
present ALEA, a computational toolbox for allele-specific epigenomics
analysis, which incorporates allelic variation data within existing re-
sources, allowing for the identification of significant associations be-
tween epigenetic modifications and specific allelic variants in human
and mouse cells. ALEA provides a customizable pipeline of command
line tools for allele-specific analysis of next-generation sequencing
data (ChlP-seq, RNA-seq, etc.) that takes the raw sequencing data
and produces separate allelic tracks ready to be viewed on genome
browsers. The pipeline has been validated using human and hybrid
mouse ChlP-seq and RNA-seq data.

able online at http://www.bcgsc.ca/pIatform/bioinfo/software/alea.

1 INTRODUCTION

Each diploid cell consists of two near-identical copies of the
genome. Despite the similarity of these paternally and maternally
contributed genomes, they differ in certain genomic loci due to
heterozygous variants such as single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs), indels and structural variations, which can be used to
find allele-speciﬁc (AS) epigenetic variations. AS events may
occur everywhere, including regions devoid of heterozygous vari-
ants. However, computational tools can only focus on heterozy-
gous loci where the allelic differences are distinguishable.
AlleleSeq (Rozowsky et al., 2011) is a computational pipeline
for phasing heterozygous variants from trio (father, mother
and child) data, constructing diploid personal genome and

aligning short sequencing reads to maternal and paternal gen-
omes. iASeq Wei et al., 2012) uses a machine-learning approach
to find the allelic imbalance by jointly analyzing multiple
ChIP-seq datasets and by improving the AS inference using cor-
relations among them. Allim (Pandey et al., 2013) is a more
recent AS tool for RNA-seq analysis of F1 individuals that
generates a polymorphism-aware diploid reference genome
from trio genomic and/or transcriptomic sequences, and corrects
the residual mapping bias when measuring the allelic expression
imbalance. What limits application of these tools for AS epige-
nomics studies is that the majority of genomic datasets are gen-
erated from single patient samples, which do not include genomic
data from the parents of the patients. Also, it is not always prac-
tical or desirable to sequence multiple epigenomic marks for each
patient as required by iASeq.

To address these limitations, we developed a new pipeline,
ALEA, for AS epigenomics analysis. ALEA takes advantage of
the available genomic resources for human (The 1000 Genomes
Project Consortium) and mouse (The Mouse Genomes Project)
to reconstruct diploid in silico genomes for human or hybrid mice
under study. Then, for each accompanying ChIP-seq or RNA-
seq dataset, ALEA generates two wiggle track format files from
short reads aligned differentially to each haplotype.

2 METHODS

ALEA consists of the following four modules for which the processes, the
input and output files and their formats are shown in Figure 1.

A. Genotype phasing: For human samples, genotypes are typically
called from whole genome-sequencing short reads accompanying the epi-
genomic dataset under AS study. SHAPEIT2 (Delaneau et al., 2013) is
then used to phase genotypes using the publicly available reference panel
of haplotypes, provided by the 1000 Genomes project (McVean et al.,
2012). We then use the phased haplotypes together with the original
unphased variant files in the Variant Call Format WCF) to create a
phased variant file with two haplotypes containing homozygous and
phased heterozygous SNPs and indels (Fig. la). For mouse datasets,
ALEA accepts epigenomic marks from F1 hybrid offspring whose par-
ents are among the 17 inbred strains available from the Mouse Genomes
Project (Keane et al., 2011).

B. Diplaia’ personal genome reconstruction: The output of the
phasing module, the phased variant ﬁle, together with the reference
genome is fed into the second module (Fig. lb) in which haplotype re-
gions are reconstructed from the individual haplotypes. Two in silica
genomes are created to be used for the optimal identiﬁcation of chromo-
somal or AS effects. For mouse, the two in silica genomes represent the
parental haplotypes, whereas for human the two genomes will essentially
be a mosaic of the parental haplotypes due to the unlikeliness of true
long-range phasing. The homozygous SNPs and indels do not need phas-
ing, and they are simply assigned to both parental genomes. Although the
homozygous variants are not informative for AS analyses, they may be
included to investigate speciﬁc epigenomic signatures between
individuals.

C. Haplotype—specific read alignment: This module aligns short
sequencing reads to the in silica genomes constructed by the previous
module and detects reads that are uniquely aligned only to one of the
two genomes (Fig. 1c). Thus, all reads aligned to multiple locations of
either haplotypes or aligned uniquely to both haplotypes are ﬁltered out
and only AS reads mapping to the regions containing heterozygous
SNPs are detected. We provide two methods to detect the AS reads:
(i) aligning the reads to a concatenated parental genome and (ii) aligning
the reads to each parental genome separately. Details and comparison of
the two methods are included in the Section 1 of the Supplementary
Material.

D. Projection to reference genome: The fourth module (Fig. 1d)
generates two haplotype-speciﬁc track ﬁles from mapped reads and pro-
jects them back to the reference genome. Owing to the existence of indels
in the construction of parental in silica genomes, the coordinates of the
tracks are skewed when compared with the reference genome. However,
most visualization tools work based on alignment to reference genomes.
Using an index created with the in silica genomes, ALEA maps the tracks
back to the reference genome.

3 EVALUATION

We used known imprinted genes to validate our AS method for
both human and mouse, as these regions are known to show
allelic differences in both expression and speciﬁc histone
marks. We used our AS pipeline on human skin ﬁbroblast
RNA-seq and H3K36me3 ChIP—seq datasets generated from
the same individual. These data are available for download
under the Gene Expression Omnibus accession numbers
GSM751277 and GSM817238. Having advance access to unpub-
lished whole genome-sequencing data for this individual, we
called and phased the genotype, reconstructed in silica genomes
and generated separate read proﬁles for each haplotype for
RNA-seq and H3K36me3 data. Figure 2a shows the monoallelic
H3K36me3 enrichment of expressed alleles in selected human-
imprinted genes. A similar approach was also applied to a re-
cently published dataset for mouse trophoblast cells (Calabrese
et al., 2012), including RNA-seq and H3K36me3 ChIP—seq data
derived from crosses between CAST/EiJ (Cast) and C57BL/6J
(B6) mice. As we expected, H3K36me3 enriches the gene body of
active genes and correlates with expression level of selected im-
printed genes in a monoallelic manner (Fig. 2b). The details of
the quantitative analysis and validation of haplotype-speciﬁc
wiggle track format ﬁles for human and mouse are described
in the Section 2 of the Supplementary Material.

Fig. 2. Viewing haplotype-speciﬁc read tracks in the WashU epigenome browser using the same scale for both haplotypes in each gene reveals that AS
H3K36me3 enrichment and RNA-seq expression in selected imprinted genes are correlated. (a) The tracks show opposite haplotype-speciﬁc RNA-seq
and H3K36me3 read proﬁles for IGF2 and PLAGLl versus RTLl in human skin ﬁbroblast, consistent with the fact that IGF2 and PLAGLl have
different imprinting status compared with RTLl. (b) Slc38a4 (Mirg)-imprinted gene is paternally (maternally) expressed in mouse trophoblast cells. The

SNP-poor regions are devoid of reads as expected

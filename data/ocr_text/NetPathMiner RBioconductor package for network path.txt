ABSTRACT

Summary: NetPathMiner is a general framework for mining, from
genome-scale networks, paths that are related to specific experimen-
tal conditions. NetPathMiner interfaces with various input formats
including KGML, SBML and BioPAX files and allows for manipulation
of networks in three different forms: metabolic, reaction and gene
representations. NetPathMiner ranks the obtained paths and applies
Markov model-based clustering and classification methods to the
ranked paths for easy interpretation. NetPathMiner also provides
static and interactive visualizations of networks and paths to aid
manual investigation.

Availability: The package is available through Bioconductor and from
Github at http://github.com/ahmohamed/NetPathMiner

1 INTRODUCTION

Mining subnetworks from genome-scale biological networks is
an important step in biological data analysis because as their size
and complexity increase, manual analysis becomes infeasible.
Various methods for subnetwork mining from experimental
data are available, where output subnetworks are expressed as
sets of nodes (Vert and Kanehisa, 2003), frequent subgraphs
(Chechik et al., 2008) or linear paths (Hancock et al., 2010).
We focus on linear paths, which are particularly useful by carry-
ing an intuitive meaning, as in metabolic reaction paths and sig-
naling cascades.

Currently, software for mining paths from networks is ham-
pered by two main challenges: (i) The lack of a universal parsing
tool for different pathway types and database ﬁle formats. In
fact, pathways can be diverse, such as metabolic or signaling,
representing chemical conversions or protein interactions,
respectively. Also, pathway information in databases can be
accessed through different ﬁle formats, with each format repre-
senting pathway structure and annotation differently. (ii) The
lack of effective visualizations for (a) different network types
and (b) up to thousands of paths.

Currently available tools are either speciﬁc to particular path-
way types or ﬁle formats. An earlier approach, Patthmker

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Hancock et al., 2010), is limited to mining paths from metabolic
networks constructed from KGML ﬁles, providing static visual-
ization on one network representation only. Tools like Pathview
(Luo and Brouwer, 2013) and rBiopaxParser (Kramer et al.,
2013) also construct networks from only one ﬁle format.

We present NetPathMiner, an R package, to overcome the
two main challenges. Figure 1 describes the process ﬂow imple-
mented in our package (see next section and Supplementary
Materials for details). NetPathMiner implements a ﬂexible
module-based process ﬂow for network path mining and visual-
ization, which can be fully integrated with user-customized func-
tions. NetPathMiner enables fast processing for all KGML,
SBML and BioPAX formats into genome-scale metabolic or sig-
naling networks (See Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 in detail).
NetPathMiner also provides path highlighting over three differ-
ent representations and interactive visualizations, making the
analysis of even thousands of output paths possible.

2 MAIN FEATURES
2.1 Pathway ﬁle processing (Step 1 in Figure 1)

Table 1 summarizes key differences among ﬁle formats supported by
NetPathMiner. To alleviate these differences, NetPathMiner processes
ﬁles into either one of the two outputs, regardless of input formats: (i)
Metabolic networks, in metabolic representation, as a bipartite graph
with metabolites and reactions parts, and edges representing production
or consumption of metabolites. (ii) Signaling networks, in gene represen-
tation where vertices and edges represent genes and their interactions.
NetPathMiner can merge multiple ﬁles into a single network.

Network Objects and annOIatiOnS. We chose igraph (Csardi and
Nepusz, 2006) to represent all constructed network objects in R to efﬁ-
ciently handle large graphs commonly encountered in biology and to
allow NetPathMiner to integrate with other network analysis tools.
NetPathMiner stores extracted annotations according to MIRIAM
guidelines and implements an attribute fetcher using BridgeDb web ser-
vice (van Iersel et al., 2010) to convert between different annotations.

2.2 Network representations (Step 2)

For metabolic representation, NetPathMiner generates two other repre-
sentations: (i) Reaction representation, where edges represent successive
reactions, (ii) Gene representation, where vertices represent genes and
edges represent participation in successive reactions. Multiple representa-
tions allow investigation of both chemical and genetic components of
metabolic activity.

2.3 Weighting networks and path ranking (Steps 3, 4)

Given a network in reaction or gene representations, edge weights can be
computed by Pearson correlation, or a user-deﬁned function, of expres-
sion proﬁles of adjacent genes. If gene expression is measured for differ-
ent categories (control/treatment), edge weights can be computed for each
category separately. From a weighted network, NetPathMiner ranks
node sequences by two methods: (i) ‘shortest path’ (Hancock et al.,
2010) returning a list of k-maximum weighted paths, (ii) ‘P—value’
(Hancock et al., 2012) returning the paths of which the sum of edge
weights is signiﬁcantly higher than that of random paths. Path ranking
can be used independently or as a part of the entire process.

2.4 Clustering and classiﬁcation of paths (Step 5)

NetPathMiner provides machine learning methods to summarize output
paths. Using Markov mixture models, paths can be clustered or classiﬁed
according to their structure or association with a response label, respect-
ively. Both methods are adopted from PathRanker (Hancock et al., 2010).

2.5 Visualization (Step 6)

NetPathMiner provides both static and interactive visualizations of ranked
paths using annotation information and machine learning techniques,

making manual investigation easier. Figure 2a-c show a visualization ex-
ample of different graph representations using the output of the last step,
allowing users to examine metabolic regulation at different biological
system levels. Visualization function matches vertices across all input rep-
resentations and plots them using the same layout. To make visualization
of a huge number of paths clearer, NetPathMiner assigns the same color
to all paths in each obtained cluster, and assigns the same color to vertices
within the same cellular compartment (not shown). Figure 2d and e show
vertices in each path as well as probability of each path belonging to
clusters. NetPathMiner also supports interactive visualization in
Cytoscape by either exporting networks in GML format or using
RCytoscape (Shannon et al., 2013), which allows thorough investigation
of vertex annotations and full customization of network colors and layout.

3 CONCLUSION

We present NetPathMiner, an easy-to-use R package for net-
work path mining. NetPathMiner constructs genome-scale net-
works from KGML, SBML and BioPAX ﬁles, overcoming the
limitations of current tools. NetPathMiner summarizes output
paths using machine learning methods and provides different
visualizations, easing manual investigations. All modules in
NetPathMiner can be used independently, particularly the path-
way ﬁle processing module, and replaced with user-customized
modules. Future developments include supporting other network
representations, such as rule-based modeling formats, as inputs
and outputs for broader integration.

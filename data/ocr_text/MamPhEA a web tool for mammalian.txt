ABSTRACT

Summary: MamPhEA is a web application dedicated to
understanding functional properties of mammalian gene sets
based on mouse-mutant phenotypes. It allows users to conduct
enrichment analysis on predefined or user-defined phenotypes,
gives users the option to specify phenotypes derived from null
mutations, produces easily comprehensible results and supports
analyses on genes of all mammalian species with a fully sequenced
genome.

1 INTRODUCTION

To biologically interpret gene lists generated from high-throughput
studies, enrichment analyses on annotations of gene features, such as
terms of Gene Ontology (GO; http://www.gene0ntology.0rg), have
become routine in genomic research. Numerous enrichment tools
have been developed in the past few years (see review by (Huang
et al., 2009). The implementation of novel statistics has provided
new tools to deal with gene sets of special property, e.g. Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) for genes with an ordered structure
(Subramanian et al., 2005). However, the power of enrichment
analyses still relies largely on the biological nature of backend
annotations used for ﬁnding enrichment.

Most mouse (Mus musculus) mutants generated in laboratories
have been designed to aid the study of human genetics, physiology
or diseases progression. According to the current version of Mouse
Genome Informatics (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.0rg/; Blake
et al., 2009), nearly 9000 genes in the mouse genome have been
mutated and phenotyped in the way that closely resembles human
clinical examinations. The mutant phenotypes characterize the
consequence of disturbing or disrupting the information output of a
gene and thus are ideal to aid understanding of how genes function
at the systems level. These unique attributes make the enrichment
analyses incorporating mouse-mutant phenotypes outperform those
using GO or KEGG pathways (http://www.gen0me.jp/kegg/), the
two most widely used backend databases in enrichment analyses
(Huang et al., 2009), in human disease candidate gene prioritization

(Chen et al., 2007) and in work to understand genetic bases of
neurological disorders (Webber et al., 2009). These cases clearly
suggest a pressing need for a versatile enrichment tool from the
aspect of mutant phenotypes in studying mammalian biology.

We have therefore developed MamPhEA (Malian P_hen0type
Enrichment Analysis). In comparison to ToppGene (Chen et al.,
2009), the only other enrichment tool employing mouse phenotypes,
MamPhEA has several unique features. First, MamPhEA allows
users to perform enrichment analysis not only on phenotypes
predeﬁned by MGI, but also on user-deﬁned phenotypes to study
complex traits. Second, different types of mutations impact protein
functions distinctly; to remove potential biases caused by the
use of data derived from differential mutagenesis approaches
(Liao and Zhang, 2008), MamPhEA allows users to perform
analysis of phenotypes exclusively derived from loss-of-function
mutations. Third, in order to give users easily understood results,
MamPhEA generates graphical and downloadable output displaying
the enriched or depleted phenotypes according to the hierarchical
structure of the phenotypic classiﬁcation. And, ﬁnally, MamPhEA
supports analyses of genes of all mammalian species with a fully
sequenced genome (35 to date).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The core phenotype data, including phenotype descriptions of each
mouse mutant strain (represented as MP IDs) and Mammalian
Phenotype Ontology (MPO), were retrieved from MGI. The MP IDs
are hierarchically structured; thus, if a mouse gene is annotated for
an MP ID, it is assigned to all the parental MP IDs. Data of the mouse
strains with multiple mutated genes were excluded. Only phenotypes
of mouse strains with homozygous mutation are considered. Loss-
of-function phenotypes, here, are deﬁned as phenotypes resulted
from mutations generated by targeted gene deletions, random gene
disruptions or gene trapping (Liao and Zhang, 2007). Finally, 8824
genes with MP IDs and 5982 genes with loss-of-function MP IDs
were identiﬁed. To support analysis on other mammalian genomes,
we obtained the orthology information of mammalian genes from
Ensembl (http://www.ensembl.0rg/). MamPhEA accepts all gene
identiﬁers cross-referenced by Ensembl (e.g. RefSeq ID, Ensembl
ID and Affymatrix ID).

MamPhEA typically compares two gene sets. When one gene set
is given, it is compared to the rest of the genes in the genome. Users
need to specify the scale of phenotypes to be examined. Signiﬁcantly
enriched or depleted phenotypes are detected by Fisher’s exact test.
P-Values are Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests. One novel
feature of MamPhEA is allowing users to customize phenotypes

of their own interest by combining existing MP IDs. Potentially
relevant MP IDs can be searched by keyword or by browsing MP0.
The option of customizing phenotypes broadens the applicability
of MamPhEA in studying complex traits or diseases, such as gene
essentiality (see Example in Section 3.2).

MamPhEA generates graphical output displaying enriched or
depleted phenotypes that are hierarchically structured according to
MP0. MamPhEA also produces classic output in a simple linear text
format showing differentially enriched MP IDs. The Web interface of
MamPhEA is built by J avaServer Pages (J SP) and MySQL database
on an Apache Tomcat server.

3 EXAMPLES

We provide two examples to illustrate the use of MamPhEA in
hypothesis testing and knowledge discovery.

3.1 Tissue expression and gene function (Example 1 on
the MamPhEA home page)

Genes have to be expressed to function in the cell; thus, it is
expected that deleting genes highly expressed in a certain tissue
from the genome will lead to dysfunction of tissues where the
deleted genes are expressed in. We compared human genes highly
expressed in liver (gene set 1) with those highly expressed in
testis (gene set 2) (Supplementary Dataset 1). Highly expressed
genes are deﬁned as genes with top 20% expression level genome
widely in a tissue, based on the human RNAseq data (Wang et al.,
2008). As expected, liver-expressed genes (gene set 1) are enriched
with phenotypes of abnormal homeostasis, abnormal metabolism
and abnormal morphology or physiology of liver/biliary system
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Therefore, contrary to the assertion
of the neutral model of transcriptome evolution (Khaitovich et al.,
2004; Yanai et al., 2004), we conﬁrm that expression of a gene is
an important component of gene function and should be targeted by
natural selection during evolution (Liao and Zhang, 2006).

3.2 Expression level and gene essentiality (Example 2
on the MamPhEA home page)

A gene is said to be essential if its deletion would render the ﬁtness
of the organism zero. Accordingly, the phenotype ‘essentiality’ of
mammals can be deﬁned as premature death or infertility of the
mutant and can be customized through merging existing MGI—
predeﬁned MP IDs (MP:0002080 prenatal lethality, MP:0002081
perinatal lethality, MP:0002082 post-natal lethality, MP:0002160
abnormal reproductive system morphology and MP:0001919
abnormal reproductive system physiology) (Supplementary Fig. 3)
on the basis of loss-of—function mutations (Liao and Zhang, 2007).
It has been found that highly expressed genes tend to be more
essential than lowly expressed genes in several prokaryotes and
eukaryotes (Hannay et al., 2008). Using MamPhEA, we examined
whether this is also true for the mouse. Mouse gene list of high
expression levels (top 20%, gene set 1) and that of low expression
levels (bottom 20%, gene set 2) were selected according to RNAseq
data from the mouse brain (Mortazavi et al., 2008) (Supplementary

Dataset 2), and were fed to MamPhEA to ﬁnd differential enrichment
of the customized phenotype ‘essentiality’. Consistent with previous
ﬁndings in other organisms (Hannay et al., 2008), highly expressed
genes were found to be more essential (609/1197= 51% essential
genes) than lowly expressed genes (273/718 = 38% essential genes)
for the mouse (P =4.95E—8) (Supplementary Fig. 4).

4 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE

MamPhEA is designed to perform enrichment analysis on
mammalian mutant phenotypes. The international genetics
community has initiated the Knockout Mouse Project to individually
delete and phenotype every gene in the mouse genome (Austin
et al., 2004). With the rapid growth of mouse phenotype data
in the near future, the power of MamPhEA is expected to
continuously increase. We update the databases used to build
MamPhEA regularly. The online tutorial of MamPhEA is available
at http://evol.nhri.org.tw/MamPhEA/tutorial.html.

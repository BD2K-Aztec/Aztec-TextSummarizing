ABSTRACT

Summary: SPLATCHE2 is a program to simulate the demography of
populations and the resulting molecular diversity for a wide range of
evolutionary scenarios. The spatially explicit simulation framework
can account for environmental heterogeneity and fluctuations, and
it can manage multiple population sources. A coalescent-based
approach is used to generate genetic markers mostly used in
population genetics studies (DNA sequences, SNPs, STRs or
RFLPs). Various combinations of independent, fully or partially linked
genetic markers can be produced under a recombination model
based on the ancestral recombination graph. Competition between
two populations (or species) can also be simulated with user-defined
levels of admixture between the two populations. SPLATCHE2
may be used to generate the expected genetic diversity under
complex demographic scenarios and can thus serve to test null
hypotheses. For model parameter estimation, SPLATCH E2 can easily
be integrated into an Approximate Bayesian Computation (ABC)
framework.

Availability and implementation: SPLATCHE2 is a C++ program
compiled for Windows and Linux platforms. It is freely available
at www.splatche.com, together with its related documentation and
example data.

1 INTRODUCTION

SPLATCHE2 (for SPatiaL And Temporal Coalescences in
Heterogeneous Environments, version 2.0) is derived from the
program SPLATCHE released in 2004 (Currat et al., 2004). This
coalescent-based program has been developed to model complex and
spatially explicit demographic scenarios, such as range expansions,
in a heterogeneous and dynamic environment, and to simulate the
resulting molecular diversity of sampled individuals at arbitrary
locations. It thus makes it possible to realistically model the
environment in order to study the impact of ecological factors on the
genetic structure of populations. This approach has already proved

invaluable to study the patterns of genetic variation in spatially
explicit contexts (F011 and Gaggiotti, 2006; Ray et al., 2005) or
the genetic consequences of range expansion (Currat et al., 2006;
Hamilton et al., 2005; Klopfstein et al., 2005; Ray et al., 2003;
Wegmann et al., 2006).

Many improvements and new functionalities have been added
here as compared to the original version of SPLATCHE, allowing the
simulation of a much wider range of evolutionary scenarios. Some of
these new features have already been used in published studies, such
as the simulation of admixture and competition between populations
(Currat and Excofﬁer, 2004, 2005; Currat et al., 2008; Francois et al.,
2010) or the possibility of deﬁning multiple source populations
(Ray et al., 2005). Those extensions have now been incorporated
into SPLATCHE2, together with the ability (i) to simulate linked
or partially linked loci, (ii) to have multiple coalescent events per
generation and (iii) to generate single-nucleotide polymorphism
(SNPs). Moreover, SPLATCHE2 is also available as a non— graphical
console program that can be used on computer clusters. Here, we
brieﬂy describe the main features of SPLATCHE2, noting that a
more detailed description can be found in a user manual.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Demographic simulation

SPLATCHE2 begins by simulating the demography of one (or two
overlapping and interacting) subdivided population(s) made up of haploid
individuals. The population demes are arranged on a 2D lattice and each
population can expand from one or several sources. Local deme density
is logistically regulated, and migration can occur between a deme and its
four nearest neighbors. Directional constraints for migration can be deﬁned
through a friction parameter. Deme carrying capacity and friction can be set
to arbitrary values in every deme and changed at any generation to simulate
environmental heterogeneity and its ﬂuctuation over time. Competition
between two populations (or species) can also be simulated, potentially
leading to the extinction of one of them. An admixture parameter A may
be used to simulate gene ﬂow between the two populations (or species). The
intensity of inter-population gene ﬂow can vary between 0 (no admixture)
and 1 (full interbreeding).

2.2 Coalescent simulation

The second phase of the simulations uses the demographic history simulated
in the previous forward step (population sizes, admixture and migration
events) to generate the genetic diversity for a set of samples drawn from the

population. Abackward, discrete coalescent model (Hudson, 1990; Kingman,
1982) including recombination based on the ancestral recombination graph
(as in the program SIMCOAL2, Laval and Excofﬁer, 2004) is implemented.
Under the coalescent approach, only the genealogy of sampled lineages needs
to be reconstructed, which results in an enormous gain in term of computation
time.

The coalescent tree obtained after such a simulation is then used to
generate molecular diversity for the set of samples. Various commonly
used genetic markers can be simulated, such as full DNA sequences, SNPs,
short tandem repeats (STRs) and restriction fragment length polymorphism
(RFLP). Various combinations of independent, fully or partially linked
loci may be simulated. Note that despite simulating haploid genes, diploid
individuals can be simulated by combining pairs of alleles or chromosomes
under the assumption of Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium.

Other coalescent simulation programs can generate genetic data under
an island model (Hudson, 2002; Laval and Excofﬁer, 2004). Moreover,
other forward simulation programs can also generate data under complex
demographic models (Neuenschwander et al., 2008). To our knowledge,
SPLATCHE2 is currently the only coalescent simulation program that can
integrate a dynamic and spatially explicit environment.

2.3 Outputs and integration into an approximate
Bayesian computation framework

The main outputs of SPLATCHE2 are a set of ARLEQUIN ﬁles (Excofﬁer
et al., 2005; Excofﬁer and Lischer, 2010) including the resulting genetic
diversity of the simulated samples. These ﬁles can thus be analyzed by
ARLEQUIN to compute a wide array of summary statistics on the data.
Moreover, many aspects of the coalescent process may be directly Visualized,
either as a tree (NEXUS format) or as the geographic locations of coalescent
events. When simulating two interbreeding populations, one can output
the resulting ﬁnal levels of genetic introgression between populations
(Currat et al., 2008). In the Windows graphical interface, various aspects
of the demography and genetics can also be Visualized (e.g. bitmaps
of deme densities, migration intensities, movement of genes during the
backward simulation). The command-line version of SPLATCHE2 has been
developed to facilitate the parallelization of the simulations, such as to
allow one to estimate population parameters [e.g. Approximate Bayesian
Computation (ABC); Beaumont et al., 2002]. Indeed, SPLATCHE2 can be
easily integrated into the ABCtoolbox framework (Wegmann et al., 2010)
allowing one to get posterior distributions of various demographic and
genetic parameters.

3 CONCLUSION

SPLATCHE2 can be used to simulate complex and realistic
demographic models and to generate the associated molecular
diversity of sampled individuals. Alternative population or
environmental histories can be modelled and compared through
their impacts on resulting genetic diversity. Due to its explicit
handling of spatial information and of environmental and temporal
heterogeneities, SPLATCHE2 is particularly well suited for studying
spatially distributed population samples over relatively short
evolutionary time scales (i.e. a few thousand generations).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Protein—protein interactions play a critical role in many bio-
logical processes. Despite that, the number of servers that provide an
easy and comprehensive method to predict them is still limited. Here,
we present iLoops, a web server that predicts whether a pair of pro-
teins can interact using local structural features. The inputs of the
server are as follows: (i) the sequences of the query proteins and (ii)
the pairs to be tested. Structural features are assigned to the query
proteins by sequence similarity. Pairs of structural features (formed by
loops or domains) are classified according to their likelihood to favor or
disfavor a protein—protein interaction, depending on their observation
in known interacting and non-interacting pairs. The server evaluates
the putative interaction using a random forest classifier.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions (PPIs) mediate almost all processes
in living cells. Thus, the discovery of new PPIs is the key to
understanding the complexity of biological systems. Several ex-
perimental methods have been developed to identify new PPIs;
among them, yeast two-hybrid and tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation
are the most used high-throughput methods (Yu et al., 2008).
However, these methods are still economically and time-costly,
and are hindered by the high amount of false-negative inter-
actions (Braun et al., 2009).

Mirroring the experimental techniques, computational meth-
ods have also been developed to identify new PPIs. These com-
putational methods can be divided into three main approaches,
depending on the contextual properties they exploit: structural,
genomic or biological (Skrabanek et al., 2008). Structural context
methods, such as InterPreTS (Aloy and Russell, 2003), PIPE
(Pitre et al., 2006) or Struct2Net (Singh et al., 2010), extrapolate
structural information of a protein directly from its sequence and
predict or score PPIs based on the molecular composition and

structural conformation of the partners. Otherwise, genomic con-
text methods like STRING (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) or
Predictome (Mellor et al., 2002) provide predictions of PPIs
based on gene fusion, gene co-localization and phylogenetic pro-
ﬁles. Finally, biological context methods [e.g. GeneCensus
(Jansen et al., 2003)] use Bayesian networks to produce reliable
predictions.

To properly assess the success of any PPI prediction method, a
reference set of non-interacting protein pairs (NIPs) is required
(Ben-Hur and Noble, 2006; Trabuco et al., 2012). The Negatome
database (Smialowski et al., 2010) is a set of protein pairs that
are unlikely to engage in physical direct interactions compiled
through manually curated literature and crystallographic data.

Here, we present the iLoops web server, a web implementation
of our recently published structural context method (Planas-
Iglesias et al., 2013) that exploits ArchDB classiﬁcation of
loops (Espadaler et al., 2004) to predict PPIs. Our method ex-
plores the balance of structural features (SFs) observed in PPIs
and/or NIPs. The server provides PPI predictions with an asso-
ciated precision using a random forest (RF) classiﬁer (Hall et al.,
2009) and considering different ratios between PPIs and NIPs.

2 METHODS

2.1 Signatures

We use the classiﬁcation of loops from ArchDB (Espadaler et al., 2004)
and domains from SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008) to deﬁne the local SFs;
hence, SFs are domains or loops. Protein signatures are deﬁned as groups
of 1—3 SFs (either loops or domains). Interaction signatures are deﬁned as
pairs of protein signatures of the same type between two proteins, inter-
acting or not interacting.

2.2 Alignment of protein signatures

Structural features are annotated on the sequences using BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997). SFs are assigned to a query protein if the sequence
alignment is above the twilight zone (Rost, 1999) and the coverage of the
SF is high enough (100% for loops, 75% for domains) (Fig. 1a). The
prediction is limited to pairs of proteins with some SF.

2.3 Evaluation of interaction signatures

Interaction signatures are scored as favoring or disfavoring the interaction
(Fig. 1b) as in Planas-Iglesias et a]. (2013), using the Negatome database
(Smialowski et al., 2010) for NIPs and the integration of several sources of
PPIs with BIANA (Garcia-Garcia et al., 2010) for PPIs. In this server, we
use larger sets of PPIs and NIPs as training and testing sets, allowing

The prediction is limited to pairs with scored interaction signatures.

2.4 Predicting a PPI

We use RF models for the prediction. RF models were generated with the
WEKA package (Hall et al., 2009) by learning from the signatures of the
training sets. Several RF models were obtained using different relative
costs (RCs) to penalize the ratio of false-positive predictions. Associated
precisions were computed for different unbalance ratios (URs) of PPIs
and NIPs (Planas-Iglesias et al., 2013). The actual server uses these RF
models to provide the prediction of the input protein pairs (Fig. 1c). Each
prediction has an inferred precision derived from our tests with different
URs.

3 RESULTS: SERVER USAGE

The input for the iLoops web server is a set of FASTA sequences
and the list of pairs of proteins to test. Data are provided
through a text area, and the user selects the type of SFs to use
for the prediction. Each submission is limited to 25 protein pairs.
The server provides a job identiﬁcation code that can be used to
retrieve the predictions. Predictions are browsed through the web
interface or can be downloaded in a compressed xml ﬁle. They
are provided as a Boolean decision (YES/NO) for each query
pair of the input list, plus the score given by the RF model. An
inferred precision is also provided depending on the expected UR
between PPIs and NIPs. This UR is selected by the user and
depends on the experiment conditions (e.g. for any pair of co-
localized human proteins the UR is ~1 / 50). The server selects by
default the best RC for a given UR. Advanced options allow the
user to select different RCs for the RF classiﬁer. Details for each
prediction display the SFs assigned to each query protein and a
list of favoring (positive) and disfavoring (negative) interaction

signatures sorted by their P—value. Help and FAQ sections in the
server provide detailed information for setting parameters and
examples of use.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

This work presents a server that predicts whether two proteins
can interact based on the identiﬁcation of SFs. The objective is
to use loop or domain patterns learnt from PPIs and NIPs to
predict the binding between protein pairs. The server provides a
user-friendly interface and a comprehensive results page.
Predictions can be traced back to the original databases to
understand how they were obtained. Such traceability allows
the user to comprehend the results and devise new experiments
for a particular interaction (e.g. identifying interaction signa-
tures that are relevant for the RF decision). The iLoops
server offers the possibility to select the expected ratio between
PPIs and NIPs in the predictions. Thus, iLoops allows the user
to address different questions, such as predicting the largest
amount of real interactions or minimizing the number of false
predictions, providing an inferred precision of the prediction.
For instance, predictions within a balanced set (1 PPI for each
1 NIP) can achieve 89% of precision and 81% of recall; con-
versely, predictions made on a set containing 1 PPI for each 50
NIPs (see earlier in the text) may expect 38% of precision and
39% of recall with an RC of 20 (Planas—Iglesias et al., 2013).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Leveraging gene expression data through large-scale in-
tegrative analyses for multicellular organisms is challenging because
most samples are not fully annotated to their tissue/cell—type of origin.
A computational method to classify samples using their entire gene
expression profiles is needed. Such a method must be applicable
across thousands of independent studies, hundreds of gene expres-
sion technologies and hundreds of diverse human tissues and
cell-types.

Results: We present Unveiling RNA Sample Annotation (URSA) that
leverages the complex tissue/cell—type relationships and simultan-
eously estimates the probabilities associated with hundreds of tis-
sues/cell—types for any given gene expression profile. URSA
provides accurate and intuitive probability values for expression
profiles across independent studies and outperforms other methods,
irrespective of data preprocessing techniques. Moreover, without
re-training, URSA can be used to classify samples from diverse micro-
array platforms and even from next-generation sequencing technol-
ogy. Finally, we provide a molecular interpretation for the tissue and
cell-type models as the biological basis for URSA’s classifications.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-scale expression proﬁling is an invaluable technique for
quantifying gene-level activity under different experimental con-
ditions. For more than a decade, researchers and clinicians have
submitted their experimental data to public repositories such as
NCBI’s Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et al., 2011)
and EBI’s ArrayExpress (Rustici et al., 2013). These repositories
now include almost half a million human expression proﬁles
from multiple laboratories and hospitals—only to further grow
with the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies.
Large but independent microarray datasets have been used to
discover tissue-speciﬁc patterns (Lukk et al., 2010; Shyamsundar

et al., 2005), establish breast cancer subtypes (Cancer Genome
Atlas, 2012; Curtis et al., 2012) and delineate the transcriptome
response to candidate drugs (Heiser et al., 2012; Lamb et al.,
2006). Previous integrative studies have leveraged these inde-
pendent datasets and have developed methods based on correl-
ation (Hibbs et al., 2007), differential expression (Engreitz et al.,
2011), supervised learning (Greene and Troyanskaya, 2011) and
data integration Wong et al., 2012). However, directly dealing
with multicellularity is paramount for precisely deﬁning human
homeostasis, disease manifestation and pharmacokinetics/
pharmacodynamics. To some effect, few studies have focused
on certain sample characteristics such as disease or phenotype
(Huang et al., 2010; Schmid et al., 2012). Yet, to take full ad-
vantage of the entire compendia in all the above contexts, we
must explicitly uncover tissue/cell—type-speciﬁc signals in
genome-wide expression data.

The current exponential rate of data submission nevertheless
makes manual annotation impractical, leaving a curated anno-
tation index for only a small fraction of samples (Supplementary
Fig. Sl). Text-mining sample descriptions are often unreliable
due to the lack of standardized nomenclature and structured
descriptive information (Krallinger et al., 2010). Furthermore,
textual information may not reﬂect the potential speciﬁcity and
heterogeneity that are concealed in the molecular-level expres-
sion measurements of these samples. Therefore, we need a seal-
able and robust computational method to discover the tissue/
cell-type signals in each gene expression proﬁle deposited in
these large heterogeneous data compendia.

In practice, tissue/cell—type annotation of gene expression pro-
ﬁles relies on the expression of known biomarker genes.
Although pervasive, this approach is limited by the number of
sufﬁcient (or often any) known discriminative expression bio-
markers and ignores potential speciﬁc signals in the entire tran-
scriptome. Machine learning methods that model genome-wide
expression have emerged as promising alternatives (Li et al.,
2004), but so far have only been applied in the context of clas-
sifying tumor subtypes (e. g. ALL versus AML) in single datasets
(Juric et al., 2005; Ramaswamy et al., 2001; Tibshirani et al.,
2002). Applying such methods across a large collection of data-
sets is impeded by the dataset, platform and technology biases
(Leek et al., 2010; Rung and Brazma, 2013). The only successful
attempt at addressing dataset biases is a nearest -neighbor (NN)
classiﬁcation method based on the barcode algorithm (McCall
et al., 2011; Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007).

The task of indexing these large heterogeneous data collections
by tissues/cell—types presents substantial challenges. First, a

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

successful method for this task should be able to classify the
variety of human tissues/cell—types, not just the better-studied
large tissue classes. For example, classifying blood from brain is
a relatively easy problem, but discriminating among different
subtypes of blood is a much harder one. Second, the method
should maintain consistency with the developmental and ana-
tomical relationships between these tissues and cell-types.
Third, the method must be robust across independent datasets
to overcome study/laboratory biases. Finally, with emerging pro-
ﬁling technologies, the method should be readily applicable to
novel platforms/technologies. No existing approach, to our
knowledge, addresses all these challenges.

Here, we present a computational algorithm Unveiling RNA
Sample Annotation (URSA) that is the ﬁrst to leverage the
relationships between tissues and cell-types (based on a tissue
ontology) and accurately identiﬁes speciﬁc tissue/cell—type signals
present in a given gene expression proﬁle. URSA constructs in-
dividual tissue/cell—type classiﬁers based on ontology-aware
sample labels and uses Bayesian Network Correction (BNC)

gregation method uses this ontological structure to model the potential
dependencies between individual cell-type models. The double circles in-
dicate the noisy individual model predictions )2, and the single circles
indicate the latent calibrated predictions y,-

(Barutcuoglu et al., 2006) to integrate these individual classiﬁers.
We demonstrate that URSA substantially outperforms barcode-
based NN classiﬁcation (the only prior approach to this prob-
lem) (Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007), as well as independent classiﬁers
that do not use the tissue ontology. Furthermore, although
URSA is trained on data from the single most popular micro-
array platform, it is able to make tissue/cell—type predictions
(without re-training) for samples measured by other microarray
platforms and even by next-generation RNA sequencing.

In the process of classiﬁcation, our approach learns tissue/cell-
type signals without the use of any tissue-speciﬁc gene database
such as the human protein reference database (Prasad et al.,
2009). Thus, by examining the biological pathways enriched
among the feature-weights in each tissue/cell—type classiﬁer, we
are able to provide a molecular-level interpretation of URSA’s
predictions.

2 METHODS

We setup the tissue/cell—type signal classiﬁcation problem as a hierarch-
ical multilabel classiﬁcation problem. From a curated collection of sam-
ples, we ﬁrst label samples into positives and negatives based on the tissue
ontology to train an individual classiﬁer for each tissue/cell—type. We then
aggregate these individual classiﬁers (in a Bayesian framework) based on
their ontological relationships (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S2)
(Gremse et al., 2011). Each individual classiﬁer identiﬁes indicative fea-
tures (i.e. genes) for that tissue or cell-type, and the Bayesian network
models the probabilistic relationship between classiﬁers to reﬁne those
individual predictions. We have previously demonstrated that such BNC
improves classiﬁcation accuracy in other settings, including gene function
prediction and geometric shape classiﬁcation (Barutcuoglu and DeCoro,
2006; Barutcuoglu et al., 2006; Guan et al., 2008; Park et al., 2010).
URSA uses the BNC approach to tackle the challenges in tissue and
cell-type prediction: limited gold standards for many general (e.g. leuko-
cyte) and speciﬁc (e.g. T—cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell and
monocyte-derived dendritic cell) tissues/cell—types, and heterogeneity
and diversity in large expression compendia.

2.1 Gold standard generation by manual sample
annotation

A set of high-quality tissue and cell-type annotations is needed for train-
ing accurate classiﬁers within the URSA framework. To this end, we
manually annotated the cell-type(s) of >14 000 microarray experiments
ranging over 500 GEO series/datasets from the hgul33plus2 platform.
These annotations are based on the sample descriptions and other textual
information available in GEO as well as the associated publications.
Tissue and cell-type terms in the BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO)
were used as the controlled vocabulary for sample annotation (Gremse
et al., 2011). Detailed description of the manual sample annotation pro-
cess is provided in the Supplementary Information. In our manual anno-
tations, 71 tissue/cell—type terms were represented by at least 3 GEO series
and 95 terms were represented in at least 2 GEO series. We excluded the
term connective tissue from the ontology because it had many children
terms, and thus appeared unresolved.

With an ontology of tissues, these manually curated annotations can
be hierarchically propagated: e. g. monocyte samples can also annotated to
leukocyte and blood (Fig. 1a and Supplementary Fig. S2). The minimal
subgraph (i.e. directed acyclic graph) that is rooted at the whole body term
and includes all cell-type terms covered in our manual annotations was
identiﬁed, and our manual annotations for 95 tissues/cell—types were then
propagated up to their ancestors based on the tissue ontology, hence
providing examples for over 244 different tissue/cell—type terms.

2.2 Expression data preparation

The Supplementary raw CEL ﬁles of gene expression samples were down-
loaded from GEO, and their probes were mapped to Entrez GeneIDs
using the BrainArray Custom CDF (Barrett et al., 2011; Dai et al., 2005).
To compare methods across different preprocessing techniques, expres-
sion data were processed using each of the three alternative preprocessing
algorithms: MAS5.0, fRMA and Barcode (Hubbell et al., 2002; McCall
et al., 2010, 2011). Default parameters and subroutines were used for each
preprocessing approach. Additionally, the absolute expression values
from the standard MAS5.0 were log transformed. As our method aims
at classifying single expression proﬁles, series-based preprocessing tech-
niques (i.e. RMA) were excluded from our study (Irizarry et al., 2003).
The Illumina Human Bodymap 2.0 RNA-seq data (GSE30611) was
downloaded from GEO and mapped to NCBI’s transcript reference
using the Bowtie and Tophat alignment algorithms with default param-
eters (Langmead et al., 2009; Trapnell et al., 2009). For tissue/cell—type
prediction, FPKM transcript expression values were given as input to our
hgul33plus2-trained method. Data transformation and signiﬁcance test
for RNA-seq (and cross platform) experiments are explained later in this
sectron.

2.3 Individual tissue and cell-type classiﬁers

Labeling positive and negative samples correctly is essential for any ac-
curate classiﬁer. Conventional multilabel classiﬁcation assumes that all
labels are mutually exclusive. For example in our study, macrophage
samples would be considered negative examples when classifying for
leukocytes, ignoring the fact that macrophages are merely a speciﬁc type
of leukocytes (Fig. 1b). Using the tissue ontology, we thus reconsider the
positive and negative samples for each individual tissue and cell-type
classiﬁer. For a given tissue term, samples annotated directly to that
term or any of its descendant terms (i.e. cell-types) are now considered
positive; samples annotated to only its ancestor terms are excluded from
training; and the remaining samples annotated to other term in the ontol-
ogy—including sibling terms—are considered negative. Now, macrophage
samples would be considered positive examples for the leukocyte classi-
ﬁer. This re-labeling is based on the very design of the tissue ontology,
and consequently expands the number of positive examples and removes
ambiguous examples.

Each individual tissue or cell-type is ﬁrst classiﬁed using an independ-
ent one-versus-all support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer using the
ontology-aware training standard. SVM maximizes the margin between
positive (i.e. yi = 1) and negative (i.e. yi = —1) examples and ﬁnds a linear
decision boundary without any assumptions of the probability distribu-
tions (Burges, 1998). Given 1 pairs (i.e. samples) of expression data xi and
its label yi, we use the L2 linear SVM (with the default cost parameter)
implemented in the LIBLINEAR software (Fan et al., 2012):

mwinéwTw + CZ;1 max(1 — y,-wa,-,0)2

where C > 0 is the cost parameter, and w the linear decision boundary (i.e.
feature weight vector). Bayesian correction (explained later in text) is
trained and applied using the SVM outputs 91, . . . ,yN of these N cell-
type-speciﬁc models.

2.4 Bayesian network correction

We use the structure of the tissue ontology as a framework of the
Bayesian network (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Fig. S2). We model each
term’s SVM output as a random event y,- and treat it as a noisy obser-
vation of a latent binary event y,~ representing the true label (i.e. cell-type)
of a given sample (Fig. 1b). The edges from y to y impose the independ-
ence of the noisy random variable y,- to all other noisy variables y,- (i 75 j)
given its true label y,-. This allows us to calculate the likelihood:

A A N A
PO’I:  :yN lyla  :yN) = “1.21 P(yi|yi)

The distribution of positive and negative unthresholded SVM outputs
varies across different terms (i.e. cell-types), and so the output values were
dynamically binned based on the number of positive examples and their
range. These empirical distributions represent the conditional probabil-
ities P03, | y,= 0) and P03, | y,= 1). The conditional probability table for
each term was estimated based on a 2-fold cross-validation that never
split datasets between folds to mitigate potential batch effects. Laplace
smoothing was applied for robustness.

The parent—child conditional probability tables were deﬁned as in the
original Bayesian correction method (Barutcuoglu et al., 2006).
Intuitively, constant priors of 0.5 were assigned to leaf nodes, and the
whole-body root node was assigned a probability of 1. This root assign-
ment allows potential dependencies between every latent variable. This
allows us to calculate the prior:

P(yl,  ,yN) = “:0 PO’iIChO’i»

where ch(y,~) is child labels of y,.

Finally, we infer the posterior probabilities P(y,-|y], . . . ,yN) for each
term i using the Lauritzen algorithm as implemented in the SMILE li-
brary (Druzdzel, 1999; Lauritzen and Werrnuth, 1989). These posterior
probabilities for each term (i.e. cell-type) are the estimated probabilities
that our method uses to annotate gene expression samples.

2.5 Method training and testing

Genomic experiments are known to suffer from potential laboratory and
dataset biases (Leek et al., 2010; Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007). Not control-
ling for this bias (during evaluation of any method applied to these data)
may result in an overestimation of performance and overﬁtting to
dataset-speciﬁc biases at the expense of the desired signals. Therefore,
for each cell-type, the series/datasets of the manually annotated samples
were partitioned into three sets with each set containing roughly the same
number of samples. Two partitions were used as the training set and the
other as the testing set. Never splitting a single series/dataset between
training and test sample sets ensures that our approach does not identify
signals speciﬁc to particular studies, but rather those reﬂective of cell-
types and tissues.

2.6 Cross-platform prediction

The individual classiﬁers in URSA were trained on samples only from the
most popular Affymetrix Human Genome U133 Plus 2.0 platform
(hgul 33plus2). URSA has not been explicitly modiﬁed or tuned for pre-
dicting across other platforms. As input to our method, a gene expression
proﬁle from other array-based and sequence-based platforms were quan-
tile transformed to generate a hgul33plus2-like expression proﬁle
(Section 2.6.1., later in the text). Additionally, a permutation test
(Section 2.6.2., later in the text) was performed to correct for potential
biases from gene coverage differences across platforms.

2.6.1 Quantile transformation The individual cell-type models in
URSA have been trained on one microarray platform (hgul33plus2).
To detect cell-type-speciﬁc information from other gene expression plat-
forms, we must ﬁrst transform those expression values to a comparable
expression space. If we can effectively transform those values, our meth-
od—without any modiﬁcations or retraining—may be able to measure
cell-type-speciﬁc signals in these cross-platform experiments. The individ-
ual expression values x,- may not be comparable across different platform
technologies (especially between array-based and sequence-based plat-
forms), but signals based on the relative abundance between genes
should be more or less preserved irrespective of the technology used.
Therefore, we quantile transform these cross-platform samples to pre-
served their relative gene abundances (or gene order) and compute

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

hgul33plus2-like expression values based on a hgul33plus2 reference dis-
tribution. This reference distribution was constructed by averaging the
expression value of each quantile across 1000 random hgul33plus2
arrays.

The most crucial bottleneck for cross-platforrn annotation is the bias
in gene coverage across platforms. The hgu95v2 microarray platform
(covering ~12 000 genes), for example, covers about two-thirds the
genes covered by hgul33plus2 (~18000 genes). Classiﬁcation is handi-
capped by thousands of missing values, and hence, the mean expression
value of the reference distribution was used to impute missing gene values
(Troyanskaya et al., 2001).

2.6.2 Permutation test A simple permutation test was performed to
select signiﬁcant predictions. The input data xj consist of real and
imputed gene values. Introducing noise to the actual data will blur any
real signal and decrease its associated probability value. Thus, we per-
mute only the sample data n1(xj), . . . , nK(x]-) to generate a null distribu-
tion of SVM outputs 7t()3,~)=(7tk(y1),..., nk (yN)), where nk(y,~)=w,~T-
nk(xj). This null distribution is then used to call out questionable anno-
tations: any tissue annotation P(y,-|y], . . . , yN) with a value lower than
even a single random annotation P(y,~| nk()31),. . . , nk()3N)) is considered
insigniﬁcant and assigned a value of 0.

2.7 Double-blind evaluation of sample annotations

In addition to the evaluation based on our manual sample annotations
(Section 2.5., earlier in text), we conducted a rigorous double-blind lit-
erature-based study to evaluate the quality of URSA’s novel predictions.
To control for any subjective bias, we must also evaluate a random group
of predictions in the same literature-based study. First, 120 hgul33plus2
array experiments from GEO that were not in our manual annotation
were randomly selected. These experiments were partitioned into three
groups. URSA annotations were made for all samples, but only group 1
predictions were retained and group 2 samples were assigned predictions
from group 3. This procedure provides random annotations while ensur-
ing the same apparent behavior of predictions as true predicted annota-
tions. We use this conservative background to completely blind the
evaluator from distinguishing original from random annotations.

The quality of predicted annotations should be judged based on re-
trieval of both the most precise tissue term and more general terms con-
sistent with the precise term. For example, an acute lymphocytic leukemia
( ALL) sample predicted to ALL but also other non-blood related terms
such as urinary bladder and colon is precise but not consistent, whereas
the same sample predicted to blood cancer cell or leukocyte in addition to
ALL is both precise and consistent. Estimated annotations in group 1 (i.e.
original) and group 2 (i.e. random) were evaluated as precise and/or
consistent based on associated publications and textual sample descrip-
tions. We also repeated this double-blind study for other microarray
platforms: hgul33a, hgu95v2 and hugenel.0st.

3 RESULTS

We address the cell-type prediction challenge as a multilabel
classiﬁcation problem with hierarchical constraints to account
for the diverse nature of biological samples. We assess the
impact of incorporating the tissue ontology in our method and
the method’s robustness across different microarray preprocess-
ing methods. Although our method can be readily retrained to
any additional expression technologies given manually curated
samples, we ﬁnd that our method is capable of precisely annotat-
ing samples across platforms (including next-generation
sequencing-based assays) without any modiﬁcations to the ori-
ginal method or its parameters. We ﬁnally show that our

tissue/cell—type predictions are interpretable based on the biolo-
gical processes enriched among learned informative genes.

3.1 URSA uses the tissue ontology to accurately predict
tissue/cell-type signals

To address the challenge of limited gold standards and high noise
levels in the tissue/cell—type classiﬁcation problem, URSA incorp-
orates the BTO to better predict tissue/cell—type signals in a given
gene expression sample. BTO systematically deﬁnes parent-to-
child relationships between tissue and cell-type terms (Gremse
et al., 2011). URSA wields the complexity of this ontology to
both systematically label samples to train tissue/cell—type SVM
classiﬁers and also apply BNC to make consistent predictions.

To measure the impact of incorporating the ontology, we com-
pare URSA with individual (i.e. independent) one-versus-all
SVM classiﬁers whose outputs are converted to estimate prob-
ability values using logistic regression (Platt, 1999). For these
one-versus-all SVMs, whole blood samples are considered as
negatives in a leukocyte classiﬁer, for example. Both methods
were trained on ~9000 samples and tested on ~5000 independent
samples (Fig. 2a). The top-predicted term for each sample was
evaluated and automatically considered incorrect if the estimated
probability value was below a cutoff. Multiple cutoffs from 0 (i.e.
no cutoff) to 0.9 (i.e. high-conﬁdence cutoff) were tested
(Fig. 2a). This setup simulates the user experience with a prede-
ﬁned cutoff and penalizes correct top predictions with a low
probability value.

Across the entire range of probability cutoffs, URSA offers
accurate top predictions for more samples in the holdout set.
Without a cutoff on the estimated probabilities, both naive
SVM and ontology-aware URSA show considerable accuracy
of the top-predicted term over the heterogeneous evaluation set
(Fig. 2a, leftmost bar). However, URSA accurately predicts an
additional ~550 samples misclassiﬁed by the independent SVMs.
Furthermore, URSA conveniently computes a probability value
for each predicted tissue/cell—type annotation that provides a
natural intuition about the strength of the predicted tissue/cell-
type signal present in a given sample. Although probabilities can
also be obtained for the individual SVMs, URSA’s Bayesian
framework provides a uniﬁed probabilistic model that enforces
potential dependencies between distant and close tissues. This
abstraction consequently computes consistent parameter estima-
tions: e.g. if the probability for leukocyte is high, then the prob-
ability for blood should also be high, but not necessarily vice
versa. Lending import to the calibrated probability values calcu-
lated by BNC, the proportion of URSA’s accurate corrections of
SVM’s mis-annotations increases with higher probability cutoffs
(Fig. 2a). In case of high conﬁdence predictions (0.9 cutoff),
URSA provides accurate annotations for ~94% of the test sam-
ples, 45% (>2200) of which were misclassiﬁed by the individual
SVMs. More detailed description is provided in the
Supplementary Information.

In addition to the overall performance evaluation, it is import-
ant to consider how annotation accuracy depends on the number
of expression proﬁles available for training for each tissue term
(namely ‘term size’). Term size also serves as an appropriate es-
timation of the term’s speciﬁcity in the tissue ontology, as sample
annotations were propagated based on the same ontology.

direct sample annotations, and the size of the point represents the
number of samples curated to that particular tissue or cell-type. Points
above the diagonal correspond to improvements by our method. URSA’s
improvements are independent of term size

URSA’s ontology-aware Bayesian framework aggregates multiple
individual classiﬁers so that classiﬁers for large terms (such as
blood) could help classify related speciﬁc small terms (such as
T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell). Using area under the
precision-recall curve (AUPRC), we compare the entire ranking
accuracy of URSA and the individual SVM classiﬁers across tis-
sues/cell—types. URSA provides increased performance for 65 of
the 71 tissue terms spanning both large general terms (such as B-
lymphocyte>0.98, breast> 0.89 and lung>0.95) and small spe-
ciﬁc terms (such as T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia cell: 1,
HeLa cell > 0.91 and bronchial epithelial cell > 0.83) (Fig. 2b and

Supplementary Table S1). Decreased performance for a few terms
could be attributed to the incompleteness of the tissue ontology
(e.g. the missing parental relationship between hepatocyte and
hepatoma cell). URSA’s improvements over individual SVMs
are greater for leaf nodes than non-leaf nodes (Supplementary
Fig. S3). The observed inverse relationship and larger improve-
ments for leaf nodes than for non-leaf nodes highlights the need
for URSA—especially for the speciﬁc terms where individual clas-
siﬁers often perform poorly due to the lack of training data. Thus,
although the number of training samples affects the quality of
individual models, our results show that exploiting the known
cell-type associations enables URSA to be reasonably immune
to this effect. These results are further discussed in the
Supplementary Information.

Even without the use of the tissue ontology, independent
SVMs perform reasonably well for easy problems such as dis-
criminating blood samples, and so the improvement of our ap-
proach is relatively small (AUPRC of 0.9072 for individual
SVMs versus AUPRC of 0.9823 for URSA). However, inde-
pendent SVMs are unable to effectively discriminate more spe-
ciﬁc cell-type samples such as T -cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia
cell samples (SVM AUPRC 0.0034), whereas our ontology-
aware approach accurately classiﬁes holdout samples of this spe-
ciﬁc blood cancer subtype (URSA AUPRC 1.0). This improve-
ment of URSA can be attributed to the effective incorporation of
the ontological complexity (Supplementary Fig. S2). Notice this
improvement also holds true across a wide range of non-blood
cell-types such as prostate gland (0.0317 versus 0.9906), bronchial
epithelial cell (0.0174 versus 0.8333) and mesenchymal stem cell
(MSC) (0.0017 versus 0.6093) (Fig. 2b and Supplementary Table
S1). The fact that these signals were learned in a completely data-
driven approach—not from known biomarkers—indicates that
our method can provide a data-driven estimation of speciﬁc
blood (and non-blood) cell-type signals.

3.2 URSA’s performance is robust to expression data
preprocessing

Data preprocessing and normalization can have a signiﬁcant
impact on downstream analysis, including prediction of tissues/
cell-type signals (Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007). MAS5.0 and fRMA
are the two most well-known algorithms for preprocessing single
arrays (Hubbell et al., 2002; McCall et al., 2010). Additionally,
the barcode preprocessing algorithm was shown to accurately
estimate whether a gene is expressed in a given microarray ex-
periment and in speciﬁc tissues (McCall et al., 2011; Zilliox and
Irizarry, 2007).

We test the robustness of URSA’s ranking accuracy to differ-
ent preprocessing methods. Our ﬁrst evaluation (using AUPRC)
shows that URSA improves performance over individual SVMs
across all three data processing methods: MAS5.0 (Fig. 2b),
fRMA and Barcode (Supplementary Fig. S4). Next, we compare
URSA with a NN classiﬁer after barcode processing, which is, to
our knowledge, the only previous approach shown to predict
cell-type (Zilliox and Irizarry, 2007). It is important to note
that the overall accuracy of the NN classiﬁer relies on the accur-
acy of the barcode preprocessing algorithm. URSA correctly
annotates ~95% of the test samples independent of the prepro-
cessing algorithm used, with >650 samples being correctly

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

predicted exclusively using URSA (Supplementary Fig. 5a).
Furthermore, our method returns better ranking accuracy for
at least 50 of the 71 tissues/cell—types than the NN classiﬁer
(Supplementary Figs. S5b and S6). Again, the performance im-
provements appear to be robust to term size.

These analyses show that URSA can adapt to both generic
(e.g. MAS5.0) and speciﬁc (e. g. Barcode) preprocessing methods
to discover tissue/cell—type-speciﬁc information in genome-scale
experiments. Moreover, robustness to preprocessing suggests
that URSA is modeling biological signals rather than systematic
biases or data processing artifacts present in these large compen-
dia. We focus our remaining analyses using the most commonly
used MAS5.0, chosen for its simplicity and application to many
array platforms.

3.3 URSA is precise for experiments from other
expression platforms

URSA is trained using data from the most popular gene expres-
sion microarray platform HG-U133 Plus 2.0 (hgul33plus2)—
with ~70 000 samples (from 2500 datasets/series) in GEO. We
have shown that URSA performs well for samples from this
platform, but there exist many other expression datasets that
use other platforms, with new ones emerging continuously. The
Affymetrix Human Genome U133A (hgul33a), for example, is
arguably the second most common microarray platform, asso-
ciated with ~1000 studies in GEO. Other genome-wide array
platforms such as HG-U95Av2 (hgu95av2) and HuGene 1.0
ST (hugenelst) have been used for their focused gene coverage.
As hundreds of such platforms have been used for human gene
expression measurements, re-training classiﬁers for each plat-
form is impractical. Instead, the challenge is to overcome tech-
nical differences across platforms and predict tissue/cell—type
signals in a platform-independent manner.

We test URSA’s potential to measure the tissue-speciﬁc signa-
tures in proﬁles from other array-based platforms without re-
training its parameters. For this, we quantile-transform input
data from cross-platform samples and ﬁlter ﬁnal predictions by
using a permutation test (see Section 2). To evaluate these pre-
dictions in a manner that best emulates an end-user’s experience,
we conduct a double-blind literature study on ‘original’ and
‘random’ annotations (see Section 2). The evaluation shows
that the majority of URSA’s predicted annotations are both pre-
cise and consistent regardless of the microarray platform
(Supplementary Fig. S7). Despite missing expression values for
>10 000 genes (due to limited gene coverage), our method is still
able to provide high-quality annotations even for hgu9 5av2 sam-
ples. These consistent trends illustrate URSA’s potential to
detect cell-type-speciﬁc signals across microarray platforms
rising above technical biases and even substantial gene coverage
differences.

Next-generation sequencing is another rapidly growing tech-
nology for transcriptome proﬁling. A sample annotation method
that can be applied to this burgeoning technology is also of great
interest, and yet the current number of available tissue/cell—type-
speciﬁc experiments limits the prospect of effectively training
classiﬁers speciﬁcally for RNA-seq experiments. To address
this problem, we test URSA’s ability to detect tissue-speciﬁc sig-
natures in RNA-seq experiments using the model trained on

UFISA prediction

Fig. 3. Accurate prediction of tissue of origin for RNA-seq samples.
Heatmap of URSA’s estimated tissue probabilities of 32 RNA-seq ex-
periments (16 different tissues) in the Illumina Bodymap dataset. The
rows are the individual samples, either single-end (s) or pair-end (p),
and the columns are the estimated cell-types

microarray data. At the outset, this is a challenging task due
to the substantial technical differences between microarrays
and RNA-seq. We challenge URSA to annotate RNA-seq ex-
periments in the Illumina Bodymap 2.0 reference dataset
(GSE30611), which consists of a diverse set of samples from 16
different tissues, generated with both single-end and pair-end
sequencing methods. URSA correctly predicts the tissue of
origin for all single-end and pair-end samples, except for adrenal
gland and adipose tissue samples (Fig. 3). For adrenal gland,
URSA ranked adrenal gland as the second most signiﬁcant
tissue signal for adrenal gland samples (and not for any of the
other tissue types such as kidney or thyroid gland). Although
URSA can eventually be re-trained to better ﬁt growing next-
generation sequencing data, its robustness across platforms and
technologies demonstrates URSA’s promise to remain applicable
and relevant to emerging experimental approaches and data
processing methods.

3.4 URSA’s tissue and cell-type-speciﬁc models are
biologically interpretable

With accurate models constructed from >14 000 diverse samples
representing over 244 tissue/cell—type terms, URSA’s discrimina-
tive features (i.e. genes) could paint a molecular portrait of
tissue/cell—type-speciﬁc gene expression. To test this hypothesis,

Fig. 4. Tissue-speciﬁc biological processes enriched in URSA’s skeletal muscle and heart models. Barplot of enrichment z-scores of top GO terms in the
two models are shown. Both skeletal muscle and heart are primarily populated by muscle cells; yet, the heart tissue model selects genes speciﬁcally

involved in cardiac muscle processes

we use the PAGE algorithm (Kim and Volsky, 2005) to examine
the Gene Ontology (GO) biological processes (Ashburner et al.,
2000) represented in each tissue/cell—type model. In effect, the
analysis summarizes the gene weights and offers a rich description
of the models. Testing all 244 cell-type models, we ﬁnd that many
of the processes enriched among most informative genes in these
models appear to be the relevant cell-type-speciﬁc GO terms. For
example, the top GO term for the B-lymphocyte model is B cell
activation (adjusted P<0.001), whereas the top GO term for the
B-cell lymphoma cell model is regulation of inflammatory response
(adjusted P<0.001). GO terms astrocyte diﬁ’erentiation, regula-
tion of synaptic transmission and behavior are enriched in the
brain model (adjusted P < 0.001). Complete results with associated
z-scores are provided in Supplementary Table S2 and further dis-
cussed in the Supplementary Information.

Certain associations are not necessarily obvious. The top GO
terms in the MSC model include mesenchymal-speciﬁc develop-
mental processes such as skeletal system development, cartilage
condensation and muscle organ morphogenesis (Supplementary
Table S2). The enrichment of glycosaminoglycan biosynthetic
process in the MSC model has some support in that glycosami-
noglycans regulate osteoblast differentiation of bone marrow-
derived human MSCs and chondrogenesis in mouse MSCs
(Kim et al., 2007; Mathews et al., 2012). The top speciﬁc GO
terms in the embryonic stem cell (ESC) model include calcium-
dependent cell—cell adhesion, positive regulation of Wnt receptor
signaling pathway and glutamine family amino acid metabolic pro-
cess. During mouse embryogenesis, inner mass formation and
cell surface polarization is regulated by the calcium-dependent
cell—cell adhesion system (Shirayoshi et al., 1983). Highly con-
served Wnt family proteins play a key role in embryogenesis and
oncogenesis, but moreover the positive regulation (i.e. activation)
of Wnt signaling maintains the pluripotency in human ESCs

(Logan and Nusse, 2004; Peifer and Polakis, 2000; Sato et al.,
2004). L-glutamine is needed for the culture and maintenance of

1n
high concentrations ' Eldor, 2006; Kent,
2009; Nakazawa et al., 1997). The enrichment of these non-trivial
and speciﬁc biological processes demonstrates the expressive
(and accurate) interpretation of URSA’s predictions.

Based on the enriched biological processes (i.e. GO terms), we
examine whether the models are speciﬁc enough to distinguish
even closely related cell-types such as skeletal muscle cells and
heart cells (Fig. 4). Skeletal muscle and heart are among the
most studied human tissues, and thus are appropriate examples
to test the speciﬁcity of our models, which are based solely on
genome-wide expression experiments. Both skeletal muscle and
heart are comprised of muscle cells, and so one might expect
that the top GO terms for both tissue models would be general
muscle-related GO terms such as actin-mediated cell contraction.
Instead, we ﬁnd that although all top enriched processes for skel-
etal muscle are general muscle GO terms as expected, the top
processes for heart (e. g. ventricular cardiac muscle tissue develop-
ment and heart contraction) are speciﬁc to heart cells (Fig. 4).
Thus, without prior knowledge of tissue and cell-type-speciﬁc
genes, URSA’s models identify genes involved in corresponding
cell-type-speciﬁc biological processes. This approach could be ex-
tended for understanding poorly characterized cell-types including
speciﬁc cancer subtypes. Our analysis altogether provides biolo-
gical intuition and credence to the basis for URSA’s tissue and
cell-type annotations.

Ontology-aware tissue/cell-type classification

 

samples to their tissue and cell-type of origin. In this article, we
present a scalable computational method URSA that predicts
tissue/cell—type signals in expression proﬁles across platforms
and technologies. Key to its performance is the incorporation
of the tissue ontology. Much of URSA’s improved performance
can be attributed to the construction of more than one hundred
additional intermediate (i.e. non-leaf) classiﬁers, which are then
integrated using a Bayesian framework.

URSA can be used to automatically annotate samples in
public gene expression repositories where most samples are cur-
rently lacking tissue/cell—type-speciﬁc information. Researchers
can discover speciﬁc signals in their own samples via our inter-
active interface at ursa.princeton.edu. Others interested in inte-
grative studies can download the URSA C++ software and
annotate samples on a large scale.

Despite URSA’s current applicability to a wide variety of tis-
sues/cell-types, its predictions can be further improved as the
ontology used for integration adds additional terms and associ-
ations. For example, immunologists may be interested in the
signal of speciﬁc T-lymphocytes such as CD4+ T cells, Th17
cells, germinal B cells, and so forth. Unfortunately, the current
BRENDA ontology (which was used as a controlled vocabulary
and the ontology structure of our method) does not include such
terms. Nonetheless, URSA’s ability to delineate tissue/cell—type
signals without known biomarker genes makes it naturally ex-
tendable to such speciﬁc cell-types as the BRENDA ontology is
extended with more terms and associations (Gremse et al., 2011).
We plan to regularly maintain and update the software with new
tissue and cell-type annotations and the latest version of the
BRENDA ontology.

Both the strength and the limitation of our method across
platforms and technologies depend on the amount of tissue
signal in the gene order and the number of missing values. For
a given gene expression proﬁle from a different platform, quan-
tile transformation is applied to compute hg133plus2-like expres-
sion values. In consequence, our method is robust to different
normalization techniques used because only the information of
relative gene abundance is transferred. However, speciﬁc signals
associated with the particular gene expression value may be lost,
and properly incorporating such signals may provide greater pre-
diction accuracy. Furthermore, expression values for genes not
measured in hg133plus2 could affect the accuracy of our method,
although simple mean imputation seems to alleviate that effect.

URSA’s tissue and cell-type-speciﬁc models provide a biolo-
gical interpretation of its predictions. As such, URSA could po-
tentially be used to test and identify possible sample
contaminations, resolve cancer samples of unknown primary ori-
gin and perhaps provide insight into the molecular basis of
poorly characterized clinical subtypes.

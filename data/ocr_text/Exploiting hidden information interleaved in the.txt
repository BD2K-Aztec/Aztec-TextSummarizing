Abstract

Motivation: Dozens of studies in recent years have demonstrated that codon usage encodes
various aspects related to all stages of gene expression regulation. When relevant high-quality
large-scale gene expression data are available, it is possible to statistically infer and model these
signals, enabling analysing and engineering gene expression. However, when these data are not
available, it is impossible to infer and validate such models.

Results: In this current study, we suggest Chimera—an unsupervised computationally efficient ap-
proach for exploiting hidden high-dimensional information related to the way gene expression is
encoded in the open reading frame (ORF), based solely on the genome of the analysed organism.
One version of the approach, named Chimera Average Repetitive Substring (ChimeraARS), esti-
mates the adaptability of an ORF to the intracellular gene expression machinery of a genome
(host), by computing its tendency to include long substrings that appear in its coding sequences;
the second version, named ChimeraMap, engineers the codons of a protein such that it will include
long substrings of codons that appear in the host coding sequences, improving its adaptation to a
new host’s gene expression machinery. We demonstrate the applicability of the new approach for
analysing and engineering heterologous genes and for analysing endogenous genes. Specifically,
focusing on Escherichia coli, we show that it can exploit information that cannot be detected by
conventional approaches (e.g. the CAI—Codon Adaptation Index), which only consider single
codon distributions; for example, we report correlations of up to 0.67 for the ChimeraARS measure
with heterologous gene expression, when the CAI yielded no correlation.

(Ramakrishnan 2002) and ribosomal RNA composing it (Li et al.,
2012), tRNAs (Alberts et al., 2002), micro-RNAs (miRNAs;
Forman and Coller, 2010), other mRNAs (Zur and Tuller, 2012),
proteins (Hogan et al., 2008) (including transcription factors;
Stergachis et al., 2013), and the mRNA sequence itself via its folding
(Gu et al., 2010; Tuller et al., 2011) (Fig. 1). The affinity of these
interactions is affected by the nucleotide composition in various
parts of the transcript (Alberts et al., 2002; Cannarozzi et al., 2010;
Chamary et al., 2006; Forman and Coller, 2010; Gu et al., 2010;
Hogan et al., 2008; Kozak, 1986; Kudla et al., 2009; Li et al., 2012;
Plotkin and Kudla, 2010; Schnall-Levin et al., 2010; Stergachis
et al., 2013; Tuller et al., 2010; Zur and Tuller, 2012; Zur and
Tuller, 2013a, b), and can usually be described by Markovian mod-
els and/or position-specific scoring matrices (Pevsner, 2009).
However, there are debates regarding the nature and the efficiency
of some of these interactions (Plotkin and Kudla, 2010).

The studies mentioned earlier support the conjecture that it is pos-
sible to accurately predict gene expression aspects based solely on the
coding sequence, and that by manipulating synonymous aspects of the
coding sequence itself, it is possible to affect all gene expression stages.
There are three major drawbacks to the current measures for inferring
gene expression based on the coding sequence (ORF):

First, most of the conventional methods for estimating the adaptive-
ness of a transcript to the gene expression regulatory machinery
are based on the independent distribution of single codons in the
coding sequence (i.e. single codon usage bias). Although there are
dozens of measures based on single codon distributions (dos Reis
et al., 2004; Sharp and Li, 1987), these methods often fail to ex-
hibit meaningful relations with the (usually heterologous) expres-
sion levels of genes (Goodman et al., 2013; Kudla et al., 2009).

It is clear that such indexes cannot fully capture all the gene ex-
pression information encoded in the ORF as some of it is not dir-
ectly related to codon decoding. For example, the binding site of
miRNAs is around 22 nt, information not fully described by the

independent distribution of single codons. Thus, a simple approach
that can capture various aspects of gene expression regulation
(Fig. 1) is needed; we term this type of statistical information as
‘high-dimensional information’ as it is related to substrings of nu-
cleotides longer than codons. This type of statistic has the potential
to encapsulate all known and unknown intracellular interactions.

Second, currently most of the models related to the biophysical na-
ture of the various interactions of macro-molecules with the ORF are
based on the analyses of gene expression measurements (e.g. mRNA
levels, protein levels, ribosomal densities, etc.) (dos Reis et al., 2004;
Lee et al., 2011; Reuveni et al., 2011; Schwanhausser et al., 2011;
Vogel et al., 2010; Zur and Tuller, 2013a, b); specifically, this infor-
mation can be used for inferring the parameters of the simulative and/
or predictive gene expression models. However, today there are
around 26 000 genomes of different organisms (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/genome), but large-scale gene expression information [e.g.
protein abundance (PA) measurements] is available for only a few
dozen (Wang et al., 2012). Thus, we aim to develop an unsupervised
measure that is based solely on the genome of the analysed organism,
without the necessity of additional gene expression measurements.

Third, there is a growing surge of new studies reporting novel rules
related to the ways various aspects of gene expression are encoded in
the transcript. One relatively simple rule suggests that the distribution
of codon pairs affects gene expression and the fitness of organisms
and viruses (Coleman et al., 2008; Irwin et al., 1995; Tats et al.,
2008); however, many of these rules are more complicated and com-
plex (Li et al., 2012; Plotkin and Kudla, 2010; Stergachis et al., 2013;
Zur and Tuller, 2013a, b) (see also Supplementary Material). Thus, it
is apparent that numerous additional rules are yet to be deciphered.
Moreover, many of the established rules are organism specific and/or
condition/tissue specific, and may not hold in different organisms/con-
ditions than the ones used for their inference. Thus, we aim at de-
veloping a measure that can exploit ‘hidden’ (i.e. unexplored) gene
expression information encoded in the ORF, which may be related to
yet unknown gene expression rules.

In the following sections, we describe an approach which encapsu-
lates all the three points mentioned above. Additionally, we devise a
novel approach for engineering genes for heterologous gene expres-
sion (Goodman et al., 2013; Gustafsson et al., 2004; Plotkin and
Kudla, 2010; Vervoort et al., 2000) based on the aforementioned con-
cepts. In Section 2 (and Supplementary Material), we will describe our
new computationally efficient approach for exploiting hidden high-
dimensional information interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic
code without prior knowledge. Since our approach is based on engin-
eering new genes or analysing genes based on patterns that appear in
different endogenous genes, we named it Chimera, which is a mytho-
logical creature composed of three different animals.

In Section 3, we will show that indeed such high-dimensional in-
formation appears in the coding regions of the analysed organisms,
and that we can at least partially infer it with our approach. As a
model organism we analyse Escherichia coli, which is the only organ-
ism with large-scale measurements of heterologous gene expression.

2 Methods

Inspired by universal approaches for data compression without any
prior knowledge of its statistical characteristics (Ulitsky et al., 2006;
Ziv and Lempel, 1977), we suggest the Chimera approach.
Generally, the approach is based on the idea that various aspects of
gene expression (mentioned above) are encoded in the ORF; thus,
these ‘codes’ (information) are frequently repeated in the coding

sequences of the organism; in addition, we expect to see more of
these codes in genes (both heterologous and endogenous) that are
highly expressed and/or more tightly regulated. Furthermore, based
on this idea we can optimize the expression levels of a heterologous
gene by engineering its codons (substrings of codons and not only
single ones) such that they will be similar to the ones that appear in
the endogenous genes of the host. This approach can be extrapo-
lated to many variants, two of which we will consider in this study:
(i) a new measure for the adaptation of the coding sequence to the
intracellular gene expression regulatory machinery named Chimera
Average Repetitive Suhstring or ChimeraARS and (ii) a new algo-
rithm for engineering heterologous genes without prior knowledge
and based only on the genome of the host named ChimeraMap. In
this section, we briefly describe ChimeraARS and ChimeraMap.

The ChimeraARS is depicted in Figure 2A. A given gene which
codes a protein, P, can be described as a sequence of codons, S; thus,
the new measure is based on the tendency of substrings in S to appear
in other genes, that is, in a reference set G. It is important to mention
that various definitions of G are possible, including considering only
highly expressed genes. For simplicity and demonstrating the unsuper-
vised advantage of our approach, we assume that G includes the entire
genome. The measure is based on the assumption that evolution
shapes the organismal coding sequences to improve their interaction
with the intra-cellular gene expression machinery. Thus, if longer sub-
strings of S tend to appear in the organism’s ORFs, it suggests that P
is more optimized to the intra-cellular gene expression machinery, and
thus it is probably more highly expressed. In addition, as we explain
in the following subsection, our measure also has important statistical
and information theoretic properties. Computing the ChimeraARS
score, ChimeraARS(G,S), of a coding sequence (S) given a reference
genome (G) includes the following steps (Fig. 2A; further details in the
following subsections):

1. For each position i in the coding sequence S ﬁnd the longest sub-
string S; that starts in that position, and also appears in at least
one of the coding sequences of the genome G.

2. Let |S| denote the length of a sequence S; the ChimeraARS of S is
the mean length of all the substrings S§:2S§/ |S

As we demonstrate in the ensuing subsections, the ChimeraARS
exploits information that does not appear in single codon distribu-
tions. Thus, among others, it can be used for estimating the adapta-
tion of the composite codon content of a gene to the cellular gene
expression machinery; because highly expressed genes are expected
to be more adapted, it can specifically be used for predicting the pro-
tein levels of a gene from its codon distribution, while considering
the high-dimensional distribution of codons.

The objective of the ChimeraMap algorithm is described in
Figure 2B (further details in the following subsections). Given a tar-
get protein (P), whose coding sequence is S, and a host genome (G),
ChimeraMap finds a new coding sequence (S‘“‘) that codes the pro-
tein P but is composed of a minimal number of (non-overlapping)
‘codon blocks’ that appear in the host genome (Fig. 2B). If several
blocks of the same length exist, we select the most frequent one,
thus further improving the adaptability of S ‘“‘ to G.

We believe that the ChimeraMap can be used for optimizing the
coding sequences of heterologous genes for expressing them in a
new host. It is easy to see that under this construction, the bounda-
ries between blocks are the only regions with codon sequences that
may not appear in the host genome; the ChimeraMap minimizes
these regions by minimizing the number of ‘codon blocks’. Since the
‘codon blocks’ already appear in the host genome, they are expected

Fig. 2. (A) An illustration of the ChimeraARS measure. To compute the
ChimeraARS measure for a certain ORF, we find for each codon (or nucleotide)
position in the ORF the longest substring that starts in this position, but also ap-
pears in one of the ORFs of the genome. The score is based on the average
over the lengths of all these substrings. (B) An illustration of the ChimeraMap
measure. The objective function of this algorithm is covering the coding se-
quence of the target gene with a minimal number of most frequent codon
blocks that appear in the host genome, such that the protein encoded in the re-
sulting coding sequence is identical to the protein encoded in the target gene.
Under this construction, the boundaries between blocks are the only regions
with codon sequences that may not appear in the host genome; the
ChimeraMap minimizes these regions by minimizing the number of blocks

to be compatible with the host gene expression machinery; the boun-
daries between blocks, on the other hand, correspond to substrings
that do not appear in the host genome, thus they may not be com-
patible with the host gene expression machinery and ChimeraMap
minimizes them.

2.1 Properties of the ChimeraMap and the ChimeraARS
approaches

All the details regarding the algorithms for the computation
of the ChimeraARS score and the ChimeraMap output appear in
the following subsections. Here, we only brieﬂy outline the algorith-
mic approach and mention the general properties of these
algorithms.

ChimeraARS is based on a pre-processing step of generating a
suffix tree (or array) of all the coding sequences of the reference gen-
ome (G); based on this suffix tree all the longest substrings of the
target P can be computed in an efficient manner, resulting in a total
running time complexity of O(|G| + |P|). The ChimeraMap is also
based on the same pre-processing step in addition to a dynamic pro-
gramming (DP) algorithm that finds the optimal solution with total
running time complexity of O(|G| + |P

ChimeraARS (and thus the ChimeraMap objective) is inspired by
information theoretic approaches for universal compression of
Markovian sequences, and estimating the number of bits required
for describing one sequence (S) given a second one (G)
(Farach et al., 1995; Ulitsky et al., 2006; Wyner, 1993; Wyner and
Wyner, 1995; Ziv and Lempel, 1977). More specifically and for-
mally, let x” denote a codon sequence of length 11. Specifically, if
the codon distribution in G and S is generated by Markovian
processes with probability distributions MS and MG
(Ms(x”)/MG(x”) is the probability of emitting x” based on the
Markovian model Ms/MG respectively), the ChimeraARS(G,S) esti-
mates the following measure (see proofs and/or explanations in
Ulitsky et al., 2006; Wyner, 1993):

108(G)/—EMS108(MG) (1)

If the distribution of S and G is similar, S can be better com-
pressed by G. If MSZMg, then the ChimeraARS(G,S) [Equation
(1)] converges to log /H(Ms), where H(MS) is the entropy of
MS and it is known that H(MS) is smaller than —EMSlog (Mg)
[Equation (2)] for MS aé Mg.

Finally, by definition, genes designed according to the
ChimeraMap algorithm should have higher ChimeraARS scores:
ChimeraMap engineers the coding sequence of the target gene such
that it will include long substrings that appear in a reference genome,
while the ChimeraARS measure detects the tendency of a coding se-
quence to include long substrings that appear in a reference genome,
and thus its adaptability to the genome’s gene expression machinery.

2.2 The Chimera algorithms

1. The algorithm of the ﬁrst version, ChimeraARS: The pre-process-
ing step of the algorithm is based on building a sufﬁx tree (or suf-
ﬁx array) (Gusﬁeld, 1997; Manber and Myers, 1993) for the
coding sequences of the host genome. This can be done in O(|G|),
where |G| is the length of the proteome/coding sequences of the
host (Farach, 1997; Manber and Myers, 1993). We will discuss
the complexity of a sufﬁx tree implementation, though due to the
genomes’ size in practice sometimes a sufﬁx array implementation
is advisable if space considerations are more critical than time.
Then, the length of the longest substring starting at each position
in the target gene that appears in the host genome can be found
in an efficient manner in O(|P|) (Gusfield, 1997) [matching statis-
tics algorithm, pp. 132—134, this is achieved by building the suffix
tree for G maintaining the suffix links (shortcuts between internal
nodes related to substrings and their suffixes), which are then uti-
lized together with the skip/count trick to shorten traversal time].
Thus, the total time complexity of the algorithm is O(|G| + |P|).

2. The algorithm of the second version, ChimeraMap: This is a DP
algorithm that builds an optimized representation of a given pro-
tein P, maintaining the encoded protein, to that of a speciﬁed ref-
erence (host) genome G, by minimizing the number of (most
frequent) substrings from the reference genome required to cover
it. This problem naively solved is essentially exponential.
ChimeraMap reduces this to polynomial time based on the obser-
vation that the optimal solution can be greedily extended in each
DP step. Similarly to the ChimeraARS, the pre-processing step of
the algorithm is based on building a sufﬁx tree (Gusﬁeld, 1997)
for the coding sequences of the reference genome in time 0( | G|).
The premise of the algorithm is that all that is necessary is to con-
sider only the previous step in the DP optimal solution space.
Thus, utilizing DP, at each step i (in which the length i of the sub-
string of P we are looking at grows by 1 from the previous step,
with i being from 1 to |P|), we look at the previous step’s (i — 1)
optimal solution and determine based on it what the optimal solu-
tion for step i is. The manner in which ChimeraMap tries to
elongate the previous optimal solution to length i is as follows.
Each optimal solution is represented by a list of pairs of numbers,
symbolizing the start and end positions of the substrings (blocks)
covering P up to that point (Fig. 2B). ChimeraMap looks at the
last such block ([start end]) and tries to find a match in the suffix
tree of G for P(start:i), and if that fails for P(end+ 1:i). If we
maintain a pointer to the end of solution i — 1 in the suffix tree,
then we can check in 0(1) if there is a match for P(start:i), by
simply continuing the down traversal on the current edge to the
next character. If a match is found we are done, otherwise a
pointer is kept to the root of the tree and we can begin the search
for P(end + 1:i) in constant time. Thus, we get a total time

complexity of O(|G| + |P|). One interesting observation regarding
the properties of the ChimeraMap is that there exists a maximal
length for a ‘covering’ substring from a reference genome. Let
lcsMAX denote the length of the longest substring that is common
to P and G. lcsMAX can be calculated using the common suffix
tree of P that is found in G and all its prefixes. If the sequences G
and P are generated by a Markov process, O(lcsMAX) is expected
to be of the order of O(log|G|) [see Equation (1)]; in the
analysed organism, |G| equals 3 958 573, the log of which is
15.2, while the mean lcsMAX is 15.3 with a standard deviation
(STD) of 38.

2.3 The optimality of the ChimeraMap
Here, we prove that the DP algorithm for the second version of the
Chimera approach, the ChimeraMap, indeed finds an optimal solu-
tion with induction, n = 

The base case: i: 1: The algorithm initiates with the first charac-
ter of P. The first solution is therefore the block [1,1], and it is
trivially optimal.

Inductive step: assume optimality for i=n- 1: We assume we
have optimal solutions for all the algorithm steps up to n — 1.

Prove optimality for i: n: The algorithm at each step looks back at

 

 

the previous solution and elongates it according to the following rule:
look at the last mapped block ([start end]) of the solution and try to
find a match in the suffix tree for P(start:i), and if that fails for
P(end + 1:i). If a match is found, merge to the current previous solu-
tion in the appropriate manner. For each solution, we elongate its last
block, thus not increasing the number of substrings covering P, and
since that solution was optimal, so is our solution for i. If we cannot
elongate an existing block, we will open a new one, [end+ 1 i], thus
increasing the previous optimal solution by one. If an existing block
could have been elongated, this solution is chosen as the optimal for
step i. If not, the optimal solution grows by no more than one. Now
assume that the optimal solution of step i: n includes 1 blocks. We as-
sume that the algorithm found all the optimal solutions for i< n and
show that it will find the optimal solution for i = n.

Since the optimal solution of i = n includes 1 blocks, the optimal
solution for i: n — 1 includes either I— 1 or 1 blocks. If it is of length
l — 1, then no extension of the last block exists, and the algorithm
adds a new block to the ith solution. If it is of length 1 blocks, this
means that an extension exists. Let us assume by negation that the
last block of the solution i = n — 1 is of length w and represents the
string or and cannot be extended. Thus, since according to our as-
sumption the optimal solution for the ith step includes 1 blocks, there
must be a block representing the string [i of length > w that can be
extended. But or is a suffix of [i and therefore can also be extended,
contradicting our negation assumption.

2.4 Additional information

Due to lack of space, additional information related to the Chimera
approach, datasets analysed, statistical analysis, and the Codon
Adaptation Index (CAI) (Sharp and Li, 1987), appear in the
Supplementary Material.

The following analysis further demonstrates the relation described
above between the ChimeraMap algorithm and the ChimeraARS
scores. We uniformly selected 100 E.coli genes according to their PA
levels and created the following variations: (i) Performing 100 random-
izations of these genes while maintaining the encoded protein, the

replacing every synonymous codon with its most abundant version,
which we termed MFSC (most frequent synonymous codon), a vari-
ation representing the encapsulation of single codon distribution.
(iii) We engineered them according to the ChimeraMap. The results of
this analysis can be seen in Figure 3, where clearly and significantly the
ChimeraMap engineered genes obtain the highest ChimeraARS scores
compared with both the randomized and MFSC versions.

3.1 High-dimensional information is encoded in the
codon usage bias and can be exploited by the Chimera
approach

In this subsection, we show that high-dimensional information ap-
pears in the coding sequences of organisms via several tests. This
was achieved by comparing the ChimeraARS scores of endogenous
E.coli genes with the ones obtained for randomized genomes that
maintain the protein content and frequencies of single codons. If in-
deed patterns of substrings of codons (longer than one) tend to re-
peat in the endogenous genome more than expected by chance, the
ChimeraARS scores will tend to be higher in the real genome in
comparison with the randomized genome.

Specifically, in order to compute the ChimeraARS measure for
endogenous genes, for each gene instead of using the entire genome,
we considered all the genes excluding the current one as the refer-
ence genome. First, we computed the ChimeraARS measure for the
real and randomized E.coli genome; the randomized genome
encoded the same protein and single codon frequencies in each gene
as in the original E.coli genome; however, it did not include the
same higher dimensional distributions (further details in the
Supplementary Material). For each gene, we calculated its
ChimeraARS score, which is the mean over the maximum substring
length of each of its codon/nucleotide positions, that can be found in
all the other genome genes. The distributions of the ChimeraARS
scores in the real versus the randomized genome appear in
Figure 4A, after removing paralogs in order to demonstrate that the
relation cannot be attributed to sequence similarity among paralogs
(see Supplementary Figure S1 for an analysis including all the genes).
As can be seen, the ChimerARS scores are significantly higher in the
real genome (16.7 versus 11.1; P: 10‘“). This result supports the
conjecture that long substrings of codons/nucleotides tend to appear
in the coding sequences of the analysed organism more than

expected by chance; thus, this result supports the hypothesis that at
least some of the repetitive codon substrings affect the fitness of
E.coli. The analyses performed in the next subsections support the
conjecture that this high-dimensional information is probably
related at least partially to gene expression regulation, as
ChimeraARS scores correlate with the expression levels of endogen-
ous and heterologous genes.

We performed an additional validation where we wanted to ver-
ify that the engineered genes which the ChimeraMap algorithm pro-
duces maintain the noted higher length distribution, and that it is
higher than the one obtained for randomized genomes also in this
case. To this end, taking each gene as a target, we built its
ChimeraMap version, which encodes the same protein, but is com-
posed of the maximal most frequent substrings in all the other genes
of the genome (excluding the current gene). We performed this for
the real and randomized E.coli genome, respectively. As can be seen
in Figure 4B, indeed the ChimeraMap engineered genes have higher
ChimeraARS scores in the real genome (18.2 versus 16.8;
P: 10‘173). This result further substantiates the conjecture that
long substrings of codons do tend to appear in the coding sequences
of the analysed organism more than expected by chance, and that
the ChimeraMap algorithm can exploit this information.

3.2 Measures based on the Chimera approach correlate
with various aspects of gene expression and include
information that does not appear in conventional codon
usage bias measures

In the previous subsection, we showed that long substrings of
codons/nucleotides tend to repeat in the coding sequences of E.coli
more than expected by chance. In the current subsection, we will
show that the repeated substrings, and thus the ChimeraARS score,
are related to the expression levels of endogenous genes. To this end,
we compared the correlation obtained between the CAI (Sharp and
Li, 1987) (a measure based on the independent distribution of single
codons; see details in the Supplementary Material), and measure-
ments related to various gene expression aspects/stages (mRNA lev-
els, ribosomal density and protein levels), to the one obtained based
on a regressor of both the CAI and ChimeraARS (the analysis was
based on cross validation and control for the number of features in
the regressor/predictor; more details in the Supplementary
Material). As can be seen in Figure 5, the correlation with gene ex-
pression indeed increases when adding the ChimeraARS feature
relatively to regression based on the CAI alone, also when control-
ling for the number of features by computing adjusted correlations
(Supplementary Material, see Supplementary Figure 52 for the cor-
relations achieved for each measure separately); the result supports
the conjecture that the ChimeraARS infers information related to
expression levels which cannot be detected by conventional
approaches such as the CAI. Thus, information related to gene ex-
pression regulation is encoded in high-dimensional distributions of
codons and nucleotides in the coding sequence.

3.3 Analyses of heterologous gene expression by the
Chimera approach demonstrate its advantages over
conventional codon usage bias measures

Goodman et al. (2013) recently designed a heterologous gene library
utilizing the first 11 amino acids including the initiating methionine
from 137 essential genes in E.coli. They generated 13 variants of
each gene, where they changed the synonymous codons used to en-
code the peptide, always keeping the start codon as ATG. Using two
promoters and four RBSs (Ribosome Binding Site), they generated

value < 10“”); the increase in the ChimeraARS scores relatively to (A) is due
to the fact that by definition, ChimeraMap genes that are engineered based
on this algorithm tend to include longer repetitive substrings that appear in
the host genomic coding sequences, and thus result in higher ChimeraARS
scores; this phenomenon can be seen in the random genome as well, further
demonstrating ChimeraMap’s ability to engineer genes. In both analyses,

tions are monotone but clearly not linear

E.coli gene (such that it will correspond to the first 11 codons that
were modified in the heterologous gene library), we calculate the
ChimeraARS score for each of the heterologous 11 codon long cod-
ing sequences. We calculated the correlation of the Goodman et al.
translation rates with the ChimeraARS score, and compared these
with the ones achieved for the CAI. As can be seen in Figure 6, al-
though the CAI does not correlate with the translation rates of the
heterologous gene library (correlation between —0.34 and 0.09; and
mostly not significant, where the negative correlation is in the wrong
direction), the ChimeraARS does (correlation mostly between 0.3
and 0.67; all P < 0.02,). This result demonstrates that the
ChimeraARS can detect the expression of genes also in heterologous
systems; in addition, it supports the conjecture that the relation be-
tween the ChimeraARS score and expression levels reported in the
previous subsection is at least partially causal/direct—higher
ChimeraARS scores contribute to higher expression levels (because
these are heterologous and not endogenous genes). Finally, since by
definition (as explained above) genes designed by the ChimeraMap
algorithm have higher ChimeraARS scores, these results support the
conjecture that the ChimeraMap algorithm should be able to opti-
mize expression levels of genes at least in the analysed organism.

4 Discussion

We describe a novel computational approach named Chimera for
exploiting high-dimensional information related to gene expression
that is interleaved in the redundancy of the genetic code, and for en-
gineering coding regions of heterologous genes without prior know-
ledge. Our approach is inspired by an information theoretic
technique for data compression, and is very efficient in terms of
computational running time.

One version of the approach, ChimeraARS, can be used for esti-
mating the amount of information related to gene expression
encoded in a coding sequence, and thereby its adaptability to the cel-
lular gene expression machinery; as we demonstrate here, this

estimation is expected to correlate with the expression levels and/or
gene expression regulation levels of a gene. In addition, we show
that the ChimeraARS exploits high-dimensional information that is
not included in indexes, such as the CAI, that are based on the distri-
bution of single codons.

Furthermore, we suggest a version of the Chimera approach,
ChimeraMap, that can be used for engineering new genes for their
efficient expression in a new host. The ChimeraMap optimizes the
coding sequence encoding a protein such that it will include as few
as possible substrings of the host genome (i.e. longer substrings). We
show that the output of the ChimeraMap correlates with the
ChimeraARS score; in addition, we show that the ChimeraARS
score predicts the expression levels of heterologous genes in E.coli
well. Thus, the ChimeraMap is expected to be a useful approach for
heterologous coding sequence optimization.

More generally, the analyses reported in this study suggest that
codon bias, if defined accurately, is useful in detecting highly ex-
pressed genes in cases where conventional approaches do not work,
such as heterologous gene expression (Goodman et al., 2013). In
addition, we show that the protein levels of endogenous and heterol-
ogous genes can be defined by their codon and amino acid content
based only on genomic information.

Naturally, our approach can be generalized in various ways. For
example, here for simplicity (and demonstrating the unsupervised
advantage of our approach) the reference set of genes used for the
Chimera approach included the entire genome. We can readily think
of other relevant reference sets such as highly expressed genes, tis-
sue-specific genes, or genes with a certain function or property.
Another variation is related to the objective function of the
ChimeraMap algorithm; there are many relevant objective func-
tions, such as functions that penalize shorter codon blocks non-uni-
formly along the ORF (if we have prior knowledge that certain
regions in the ORF contribute less to its regulation), function(s) that
trade-off frequency versus substring length in a different manner
than the one reported here, or weighted functions according to the
frequency of the substrings. Thus, we can extrapolate many variants
of the approach, and in that manner calibrate it to suit specific prob-
lems. The last example is related to the alphabet used; here, for sim-
plicity, we worked with nucleotides (Supplementary Material);
however, it may make sense to work with codons, codon pairs, or
divide the codons to sub-sets of codons assumed to be ‘identical’.

Moreover, a version of the Chimera approach may also be used
for engineering and estimating the information related to gene ex-
pression encoded in other parts of the gene such as untranslated re-
gions and introns, known to also include signals related to gene
expression regulation (Goodarzi et al., 2012; Wang and Cooper,
2007)

The ChimeraARS algorithm may also be modified to consider
both substrings’ lengths and their frequencies. In such a case, the
major challenge is to model the trade-off between length and fre-
quency. We believe that the trade-off is organismal specific and
should be inferred for each organism separately, possibly based on
gene expression (adding additional layers of complexity to such a
measure).

Finally, in this study, we analysed E.coli because this is the only
organism with large-scale measurements of both heterologous and
endogenous gene expression data. However, we believe that the re-
sults reported here will be even more significant for eukaryotes, and
specifically multi-cellular organisms such as plants; there are differ-
ent stages of gene expression, including many types of interactions
with the mRNA molecules that occur only in these groups of organ-
isms; for example, splicing, interaction with the nuclear pores, and

regulation by miRNA (Fig. 1), occur only in eukaryotes; all these ex-
amples include interactions between the intracellular machinery and
the mRNA molecule, and are at least partially encoded in the ORF
via the high-dimensional distribution of codons. These signals are
expected to be detected by the Chimera approach, but not by single
codon measures of codon usage bias.

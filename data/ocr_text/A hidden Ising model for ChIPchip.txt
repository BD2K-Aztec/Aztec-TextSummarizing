ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChlP) coupled with
tiling microarray (chip) experiments have been used in a wide range
of biological studies such as identification of transcription factor
binding sites and investigation of DNA methylation and histone
modification. Hidden Markov models are widely used to model
the spatial dependency of ChlP-chip data. However, parameter
estimation for these models is typically either heuristic or suboptimal,
leading to inconsistencies in their applications. To overcome this
limitation and to develop an efficient software, we propose a hidden
ferromagnetic lsing model for ChlP-chip data analysis.

Results: We have developed a simple, but powerful Bayesian
hierarchical model for ChlP-chip data via a hidden lsing model.
Metropolis within Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to simulate from
the posterior distribution of the model parameters. The proposed
model naturally incorporates the spatial dependency of the data, and
can be used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and
sample sizes. We illustrate the method using three publicly available
datasets and various simulated datasets, and compare it with three
closely related methods, namely TileMap HMM, tileHMM and BAC.
We find that our method performs as well as TileMap HMM and BAC
for the high-resolution data from Affymetrix platform, but significantly
outperforms the other three methods for the low-resolution data
from Agilent platform. Compared with the BAC method which also
involves MCMC simulations, our method is computationally much
more efficient.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identiﬁcation of the sites of interactions between proteins and
genomic DNA is one of the most important topics in biological
research. The emergence of high—density tiling microarrays has
made it possible to create high—resolution global maps of the
in vivo interactions between speciﬁc proteins and genomes. Tiling
arrays use millions of short oligonucleotide probes with various
resolutions to interrogate genomic regions of interest. Chromatin
immunoprecipitation (ChIP)—chip analysis has become a powerful
technique used to determine the binding sites of DNA—binding

proteins at a genome—wide basis (Cawley et al., 2004; Boyer et al.,
2005).

It is a challenge to analyze ChIP—chip data, due to the huge
amount of probes, the small number of replicates and various noises
introduced in the experiments. The most important feature of ChIP—
chip data is the neighboring dependency of the probe intensities.
Quite a few of existing methods in the literature make efforts
to incorporate the dependence structure of ChIP—chip data into
various statistical models. Sliding window methods may be the most
straightforward ones. These methods are to test a hypothesis for
each probe or region using the statistic that is built based on all
the probes’ information within a sliding window of certain genomic
distance. The test statistics used are varied. For example, Cawley
et al. (2004) used Wilcoxon’s rank sum statistics, Keles et al. (2006)
used the moving average of classical t—statistics, J i and Wang (2005)
used the moving average of empirical Bayesian t—statistics and
Buck et al.(2005) used the moving average of log2 ratios. Since
a huge number of tests are performed and the test statistics are not
independent, these approaches leave with a difﬁcult problem for
multiple hypothesis testing adjustment. Two signiﬁcant variants of
the sliding window methods are the joint binding deconvolution
(JBD; Qi et al., 2006) and the model—based deconvolution (with the
software MeDiChI) (Reiss et al., 2008), which ﬁt a local regression
for each probe with the nearby probes within a sliding window used
as explanatory variables, and the inference is made based on the
ﬁtted regression coefﬁcients.

Hidden Markov models (HMMs; Ji and Wang, 2005; Li et al.,
2005; Munch et al., 2006; Humburg et al., 2008) are appealing
approaches to model the dependency of ChIP—chip data. However, in
most of the existing implementations of HMM methods, parameter
estimation for the models is typically either ad hoc or suboptimal for
ChIP—chip data. For example, Li et al. (2005) estimated the model
parameters using the results from a previous Affymetrix SNP array
experiments. Munch et al. (2006) estimated the model parameters
using the Baum—Welch algorithm (Baum, 1972). Humburg et al.
(2008) used the Baum—Welch algorithm (Rabiner, 1989) plus Viterbi
training (J uang and Rabiner, 1990) to estimate the model parameters.
The major limitation of these algorithms, as pointed out by Humburg
et al. (2008), is that the Baum—Welch algorithm tends to converge
to a local maximum of the likelihood function and the Viterbi
training algorithm even fails to converge to a local maximum of the
likelihood in some cases. Therefore, the parameter estimates and
followed inference are often suboptimal to the problem. Markov
random ﬁelds is a natural generation of Markov processes in which
a space index is used to replace the time index. Markov random
ﬁeld models are appealing alternative approaches for ChIP—chip
data because the spacial dependency can be naturally modeled.

The Bayesian hierarchical model proposed by Gottardo et al.
(2008) modeled the probe intensities using a mixture of normal
distributions, and the spatial dependency of the probes through a
Markov random ﬁeld prior, which is a Gaussian intrinsic auto—
regression model (Besag and Kooperberg, 1995). The important
feature of this model is that neighboring probes are encouraged to
be in the same state (enriched or non—enriched), which is a typical
characteristic of ChIP—chip data. The inference is based on the joint
probability of neighboring probes, which in fact is an off—model
remedy because the model itself is not able to completely simulate
the spatial dependency of ChIP—chip data. A limitation of the model
used by Gottardo et al. (2008) is that it is very computationally
intensive: for a dataset with 300 000 probes, it needs about 10h for
15 000 iterations on a personal computer.

We note that the locally self—clustering behavior of the ChIP—
chip data is extremely similar to the phenomenon observed
in ferromagnetic materials, which has been extensively studied
by physicists. In ferromagnetic materials, many electrons act
cooperatively and spin in the same direction. The Ising model,
named after the German physicist Ernst Ising, was designed to
investigate whether local forces can cause a large number of the
electrons to spin in the same direction. For further details of the
Ising model, we refer the reader to Kindermann and Snell (1980).
Here, we just brieﬂy describe the concept. The 1D Ising model
considers a sequence of points on a line. At each point, there is
an atom of a magnetic material which at any given moments is
in one of two states, ‘up’ and ‘down’. If we think of each probe
along the chromosomes is in one of two states, enriched or non—
enriched, then the Ising model could be a good ﬁt to ChIP—chip data.
In this article, we propose to model ChIP—chip data through a hidden
ferromagnetic Ising model. The rationale underlying this modeling
will be explained further in later sections. Our method differs from
the existing methods that also model the spacial dependency such
as HMMs (Ji and Wang, 2005; Li et al., 2005; Munch et al.,
2006; Humburg et al., 2008) and the Bayesian hierarchical model
(Gottardo et al., 2008) in several respects. First, unlike the existing
HMM methods, we model ChIP—chip data in a fully Bayesian
framework and simulate the posterior distributions of the model
parameters using the Metropolis within Gibbs sampler. Second,
our method naturally takes into account the dependence structure
of the data, does not need off—model remedy for inference and is
computationally much more efﬁcient as compared with the Bayesian
hierarchical model (Gottardo et al., 2008). Third, our method makes
little assumption about the size of IP—enriched regions, and it is able
to detect IP—enriched regions with few to numerous probes. As a
result, our method signiﬁcantly outperforms the existing methods for
the data with low—genomic resolutions. We will demonstrate these
advantages of our method using three real and various simulated
datasets.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows. In Section 2,
we describe our new Bayesian hierarchical model and its Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) implementation. In Section 3, we
compare our method to three closely related methods, namely
TileMap HMM (Ji and Wang, 2005), tileHMM (Humburg et al.,
2008) and BAC (Gottardo et al., 2008) using three experimental
datasets. In Section 4, we comparatively evaluate the performances
of our method and the three alternative methods by a series of
simulation studies. In Section 5, we conclude this article with a
brief discussion.

2 THE MODEL

Let y=(y1, ...,yn) be a realization of relative enrichment measurements
Y: (Y 1, ..., Y”) on n probes along chromosomes. Here, the deﬁnition of
Yl- is ﬂexible. It could be any appropriate measurement for comparison of
treatment (IF—enriched) and control (non—enriched) samples. For example, y,-
could be a log ratio of IP—enriched and control samples for an experiment
with single replicate, or a summary statistic constructed at the probe level for
an experiment with multiple replicates. The proposed method is designed to
model the probe enrichment measurements, instead of the probe intensities,
as the latter may have sequence—speciﬁc effects due to different binding
afﬁnities. A wisely designed statistic of enrichment measurement could
remove the sequence—speciﬁc effects in preparation of the data y, for example,
by subtracting the probe intensities of the control samples from that of the IP—
enriched samples. We let each probe associate with a binary latent variable
X,- e {— l, l}, where X,- = 1 denotes that the probe belongs to a enriched region,
and —l a non—enriched region. We assume, conditioning on X,- =x,-, Y ,- follows
a normal distribution

N ,02 ifx-=—1,
yilxi~{ (Ma ) 1

N(;Lb,0'2) irx,=1. (1)

Furthermore, we assume, conditioning on X=(X1,...,X,,), Y1,...,Y,, are
independent. Thus, we have

2.1 The priors

Let A204. To conduct a Bayesian analysis, we assume that 6 and
(11.0, ab, A) have the following prior densities:
1
13” Uniform(0,100), Mum/Lb, A) 0< X. (3)
The prior imposed on 6, which, as a practical matter, is equivalent to

uniform(0,oo), but ensures the posterior to be proper. The hidden state
vector X is modeled by a 1D ferromagnetic Ising model

1 11—1
mmn=zgwm0§3mnq, m
i=1

where 6 is the interaction parameter, and Z (6) is the normalizing constant
of the distribution, which has a closed form (Baxter, 1982)

mn=ﬂwmww*. (a

When 6 = 0, it means that there is no interaction between probes; when 6 < 0,
the model (4) tends to generate a spatial pattern with more adjacent probes
being in opposite states; when 6 > 0, the model (4) is called the ferromagnetic
Ising model. Only when 6 > 0, the proposed model reﬂects the structure of
ChIP—chip data. Therefore, we restrict 6 to be positive. A large positive
value of 6 gives rise to large clusters of probes. Here, we only consider the
interactions among the nearest neighbors. When the interaction is beyond
the nearest neighbors, the model turns into a high—order Ising model, and
Z (6) become intractable. For a high—order 1D Ising model, sampling from
the posterior distribution of 6 is extremely difﬁcult considering the huge
number of probes that are needed to be processed.

The rationale underlying the model (4) can be justiﬁed from the
perspective of ChIP—chip experiments as follows. In ChIP—chip experiments,
genomic DNA is sheared into fragments with various lengths, typically
ranging from 200 to 1000 bp. The DNA fragments bound by binding proteins

are enriched through immunoprecipitation (IP). After ampliﬁcation and
labeling, the IP—enriched DNA fragments are further chopped to smaller
pieces for hybridizations. As a result of this process, all probes in the vicinity
of the binding sites have chances to hybridize to the IP—enriched DNA
fragments, resulting in consecutive probes with relatively high intensities.
In contrast, if the DNA fragments do not contain binding sites, it is expected
that the probe intensities in that genomic regions represented by consecutive
probes are primarily composed of background intensities. Therefore, the
probes along the chromosomes tend to form clusters, which are made of
consecutive probes of the same state (enriched or non—enriched). The cluster
sizes depend on the genomic resolution and the lengths of sheared DNA
fragments. For example, for an array with 35 bp resolution, each IP—enriched
region may consist of approximately 10—58 probes; and for an array with
280 bp resolution, each IP—enriched region may consist of approximately
1—7 probes. This locally self—clustering phenomenon of ChIP—chip data is
extremely similar to the cooperative behavior of magnetic materials, which
has been modeled by Ising models in physics. If we code the probes belonging
to the enriched and non—enriched regions by l and —1, respectively, then the
hidden state vector introduced in (1) can be viewed as a conﬁguration of an
Ising model and can thus be modeled by (4).

We note that an analogy of our model in 2D space, where Y is observed on
a rectangular lattice, has often been used in image analysis and segmentation
(see, e.g. Hum et al., 2003; Ibanez and Simo, 2003).

2.2 The full conditionals

Let na 2 217:1 I (x,- = — l) and m, = 217:1 I (x,- = 1) be the total numbers of non—
enriched and enriched probes, respectively. Let y, = % 227:1 I (x,- = — l)y,- and
52;, = % 217:1] (x,- = l)y,- be the sample means of the measurements for non—
enriched and enriched probes, respectively. In addition, let N(a,b) denote
a Gaussian distribution with mean a and variance [7, let Ga(a,b) denote a
gamma distribution with mean a/b and variance a/bz, and let y | ' denote the
full conditional distribution of y given everything else in the model. After
some algebra, we get the following full conditional distributions:

2.3 Metropolis within Gibbs sampling

Given the full conditional distributions (6—9), it is straightforward to simulate
from the posterior distributions using a cyclic Gibbs sampler. The posterior
distribution of 6 can be simulated using the Metropolis—Hastings algorithm
with a Gaussian random walk proposal. The acceptance probability of the

update is

where 6 is the current value and 6/ is the proposed value. The posterior
probabilities of the hidden variable X i, i = l, 2, . . . , n, will be used for inference
of binding sites.

3 CASE STUDY: ANALYSIS OF TRANSCRIPTION
FACTOR CHIP-CHIP DATA

3.1 The p53, Oct4 and Nanog data

Cawley et al. (2004) mapped the binding sites of three transcription factors
(TFs), p53, Spl and cMyc on human chromosomes 21 and 22 using the
Affymetrix tiling arrays with an average of 35 bp resolution. All experiments
were done with six replicates. The perfect match (PM) intensities were used
as the measurements of the abundance of DNA fragments. The PM intensities
were log2 transformed and then quantile normalized within treatment and
control replicate groups, respectively (Irizarry et al., 2003). Finally, all arrays
were scaled to have the same median value. Here, we focus on the p53—D01
experiments in which antibody p53—D01 was used for the IP, and the antibody
against bacterial GST was used in the control experiment. The chromosome
22 in the p53 experiments had the most validated regions (nine in total).
Therefore, the RT—PCR validated regions on the chromosome 22 were used
as the gold standard for comparison.

Boyer et al. (2005) used the Agilent promoter arrays with an average of
280 bp resolution to identify the binding sites of three TFs Oct4, Nanog and
Sox2. In the experiments, IP—enriched DNA was labeled with Cy5 dye, and
whole—cell extract DNA was used as a control and labeled with Cy3 dye. All
experiments were done in duplicates. The Cy5 and Cy3 intensities were log2
transformed and then quantile normalized. Oct4 and Nanog data were used
for the purpose of illustration and comparison.

3.2 A comparative evaluation of the four methods

Both TileMap HMM (Ji and Wong, 2005) and tileHMM (Humburg et 01.,
2008) use a two—step approach for the data with multiple replicates. In
the ﬁrst step, probe—level statistics that measure the relative abundance of
DNA fragments in the treatment and control experiments are calculated.
In the second step, the regularized t—statistics are used to build a HMM,
in which they are treated as the outcomes of enriched and non—enriched
hidden states. Following these approaches, we also used a two—step approach
for the data with multiple replicates. We ﬁrst calculated a statistic for
each probe and then modeled the statistics using the proposed method.
Regarding the probe—level statistics, there are several choices available,
for instance, the moderated t—statistic (Smyth, 2004), the empirical Bayes
t—statistic (Ji and Wong, 2005) and the shrinkage t—statistic (Opgen—Rhein
and Strimmer, 2007). All these statistics are constructed by borrowing
information from all probes on the microarray to estimate individual
variances, resulting in increased performance compared with the ordinary
t—statistic. To compare the performances of the proposed method and the
alternative methods, we used the same statistic for all the three methods.
Here, we chose the moderated t—statistic, which has been implemented in
the limma package in R (http://www.bioconductor.org/). For this reason, we
will call the moderated t—statistic limma t—statistic. The limma t—statistic has
a robust behavior and good performance even for small numbers of replicates
(Smyth, 2004; Opgen—Rhein and Strimmer, 2007). Therefore, we used this
statistic as the enrichment measurement of DNA fragments.

For comparison of our method and the three alternative methods, we
ﬁrst evaluated these methods using a high— genomic resolution dataset—the
p53 chromosome 22 data, and then two low—genomic resolution datasets—
the Nanog and Oct4 data. To use our method, we need to initialize two
model parameters, the latent vector X and the interaction parameter 6.

Nanog and Oct4 data.

For both parameters, prior information can be used to set the initial values.
It is generally known that the enrichment measurement of an enriched probe
is typically several standard deviations (SDs) higher than the mean value.
Therefore, we set the initial sate of each probe to 1 if its limma t—statistic is >2
SDs of the mean value and 0 otherwise. The parameter 6 plays an important
role on the model (4). It affects the cluster number and size of the probes.
A probe cluster is deﬁned as consecutive probes in the same state (enriched
or non—enriched). We can think of a genome that is partitioned into a series
of segments, non—enriched and enriched regions, and each of the segments
is a cluster. When 6 is small, the neighboring effect of probes is weak. As a
result, the probes tend to form many small clusters. When 6 increases, the
number of probe clusters decreases, and the cluster size increases. We set
the initial value of 6 to 3.0 and updated 6 using the Metropolis—Hastings
algorithm with a Gaussian random walk proposal with SD 0.01. The other
parameters were updated using a cyclic Gibbs sampler.

To apply TileMap HMM and BAC to ChIP—chip data, an important
parameter to be determined in advance is the size of the sliding window.
Both TileMap HMM and BAC have been used to analyze the p53 data, thus
we just used the default parameters given by the authors. For the Agilent
Oct4 and Nanog data, we followed the suggestions by the authors, adjusting
the sliding window size according to the probe resolution and the average
length of the sheared DNA fragments. Boyer et al. (2005) reported that the
maximum sheared DNA fragment size was ~550 bp, which suggests that the
DNA fragments would approximately cover three to ﬁve probes, given that
the probe resolution is ~280 bp. In fact, we have tried different window sizes
for the two methods and found the results were best when the size was set
to this range. This is consistent with our estimation. The tileHMM method
uses t emission distribution in the HMM, thus it needs to choose a degree of
freedom for the t—distribution. We also tried different values in order to obtain
the best results. Therefore, for the three alternative methods, we report the
best results we could obtain. For our method, we let the Metropolis within
Gibbs sampler run for 50 000 iterations (the ﬁrst 10 000 used as bum—in)
for the p53 and Nanog data, and 70 000 iterations (the ﬁrst 30 000 used as
burn—in) for the Oct4 data. Figure 1 shows the histograms of the 6 samples
generated from their posterior distributions. The means and standard errors
(in the parentheses) of the 6 parameters are 3.55(0.026),2.58(0.013) and
2.96(0.024) for the p53, Nanog and Oct4 data, respectively.

We compared our methods with the three alternative methods using the
validated regions or high—conﬁdence enriched regions as the gold standard.
For the p53 chromosome 22 data, there were nine RT—PCR validated enriched
regions. For the Nanog and Oct4 data, although there were not RT—PCR
validated regions, the authors (Boyer et al., 2005) reported 367 potentially

The lsing, TileMap HMM and BAC detect all the nine validated (V) regions for the
p53 data at ﬁxed posterior probability and FDR cutoffs; tileHMM essentially fails for
the p53 data. For the Oct4 and N anog data, the Ising method detects much more gold
(G) regions and total enriched regions than TileMap HMM and BAC; tileHMM detects
more gold regions than lsing at the expense of big false positives.

enriched regions on 353 genes that were co—occupied by the three TFs,
Nanog, Oct4 and Sox2. To detect enriched regions, Boyer et a]. (2005)
calculated a score for each probe using the so—called whole—chip error model.
A single probe P—value (SPP) was then calculated for each score, and a probe
set P—value (PSP) was calculated for the average score of each probe and its
two immediate neighbors. Aprobe set is said to be enriched if its PSP <0.001
and two of the SPPs<0.005, or the center SPP< 0.001 and one of the ﬂanking
SPPs<0.l. Although the false discovery rate (FDR) was not estimated for
the 367 regions, they still should be a good standard for the comparison
considering that these regions are detected by all the three experiments. To
ease comparison, we selected ﬁxed posterior probability and FDR cutoffs.
The latter was calculated using a direct posterior probability approach as
described in Newton et al. (2004). Following the approach used by Cawley
et al. (2004), we merged adjacent enriched probes separated by 500 bp or less
into the same enriched region. The results are summarized in Table l, where
‘Ising’ refers to our method. For the p53 data, at the posterior probability
cutoff 0.9 and FDR cutoff 0.05, all the four methods detect the nine validated
enriched regions. Although tileHMM detects all the nine validated regions,
it essentially fails for the p53 data. For example, it detects 15 027 enriched
regions, which are obviously dominated by false enriched regions. We further
looked into the ranking performance of these validated regions. The nine
validated regions on chromosome 22 are found by lsing, TileMap HMM and
BAC in their top 60 regions. However, none is found by tileHMM, which
further supports that most of the enriched regions detected by tileHMM are
false positives. For the Oct4 and Nano g data, at the ﬁxed posterior probability
and FDR cutoffs, our approach detects much more gold regions and total

the Oct4 data because it only detects a small number of enriched regions at
various posterior probability and FDR cutoffs. It is pretty clear that most of
the enriched regions are not detected by TileMap HMM and BAC for the
Oct4 and Nano g data. Although tileHMM detects more gold regions than our
method, it achieves this at the expense of a lot of false positives. Therefore,
based on these real examples, our approach seems to perform at least as well
as the others for the high—resolution data, but signiﬁcantly outperform the
others for the low—resolution data.

To get a better sense of the performance of these methods, it may be
necessary to show the results in a typical genomic region. Figures 2 and 3
show the posterior probabilities of probes in enriched state against the
genomic positions for a small portion of the p53 and Oct4 data. In general, the
posterior probabilities produced by TileMap HMM, BAC and our methods
tend to be dichotomized, either close to 0 or 1. As expected, most of the
posterior probabilities are close to 0, which corresponds to the non—enriched
state. This indicates a clear classiﬁcation of enriched and non—enriched
probes. In contrast, the posterior probabilities generated by tileHMM are not

Fig. 4. Distribution of limma t—statistics and posterior probabilities of probes
in enriched state in typical enriched regions for the p53 data (A and B) and
the Nanog data (C and D). The enriched region for the p53 data contains

enriched region for the Oct4 data only contains 4—5 probes due to the low
probe resolution (280 bp).

dichotomized, indicating that it is not able to produce a clear classiﬁcation of
enriched and non—enriched probes. For the high—resolution p53 data, TileMap
HMM, BAC and our method work well. The two conﬁrmed enriched regions
are successfully detected by all the three methods (Fig. 2). However, most
of the posterior probabilities generated by tileHMM are close to l, and this
is obviously unrealistic (Fig. 2). For the low—resolution data, as shown in
Figure 3, our method detects more potential enriched regions than TileMap
HMM and BAC. TileHMM also fails for this data, because the posterior
probabilities generated by that are not dichotomized and have too many
high values in the non—enriched regions. Figure 4 shows the typical enriched
regions detected by our method for the data with high— and low—genomic
resolutions. Due to different genomic resolutions, the numbers of probes used
to interrogate the enriched regions are much different. The enriched region
for the p53 data in Figure 4 are composed of about 19 probes. In contrast,
there are only 4—5 probes in the Nanog enriched region. Our method is able
to detect enriched regions with few to numerous probes.

4 SIMULATION STUDIES

In order to have a thorough evaluation of the performance of
the Ising model in comparison with the other three methods, we
carried out a series of simulations. For a fair comparison, we tried
to generate simulated data that reﬂect the underlying structure of
ChIP—chip data, instead of generating particular data to satisfy each
model. The probe enrichment measurements in a enriched region
typically form a triangular or bell—shaped structure (e. g. see Fig. 4),
where the peak location is usually closest to the actual binding site.
Following Gottardo et al. (2008), we used the function given by
M exp(—4D1,27 /L2) to model the probe intensities in the enriched
regions, where M is the value of the peak, Dp is the genomic distance
between probe 19 and the peak and L is the length of the enriched
region.

To generate simulated data with high— and low—genomic
resolutions, we used the ﬁrst 40 000 genomic positions of the
Affymetrix chromosome 22 and the Agilent chromosome 1 as the
genomic coordinates, respectively. The binding site of a TF is

typically about several base pairs, thus a probe can completely
cover it. Therefore, it is appropriate to choose the genomic position
of a probe as a peak position. To generate data for enriched
regions, we randomly selected 40 genomic positions as the peak
positions. The values for the peaks were randomly generated from
a uniform distribution between 3 and 8, and the length of the
enriched regions (parameter for L) were randomly generated from
a uniform distribution between 400 bp and 1000 bp. The probes in
a given enriched region were set to the values according to the
function M exp(—4Dl2, /L2) if the distances between the probes and
the peak are SL / 2 bp, and zero otherwise. In addition, we also added
background noises to the probes in the enriched regions. Background
noises were generated from the normal distributions with mean 0 and
variances of 1, 2.25 and 4, respectively. For the probes in the non—
enriched regions, their values were set to pure background noises.
We simulated 60 high—resolution and 60 low—resolution datasets.
Each dataset contained three replicates for both control and treatment
conditions, and each replicate contained 40 000 probes. Among
the 60 high— or low—resolution datasets, 20 were created using the
background noise with a variance of 1, another 20 with a variance of
2.25 and the rest 20 with a variance of 4. In summary, we generated
six different datasets corresponding to the six combinations: two
different genomic coordinates x three different background noises.

We evaluated the performance of the four methods by comparing
the receiving operating characteristic (ROC) curves for each
simulation scenario. The ROC curves show the average number
of positive regions against the average number of false positive
regions detected by each method when varying the posterior
probability cutoff (Fig. 5). For the simulated high—resolution data
(Fig. 5A, C and E), regardless the amount of noise added to the
data, all the methods perform almost equally well. The area under
ROC curve (AUC) is around 1 for each method. This indicates that
all the four methods are quite robust to the noise. For the simulated

low—resolution data (Fig. 5B, D and F), our method performs the best
when the level of noise is low (the variance of noise are equal to 1
or 2.25). When the variance of noise increases to 4, BAC performs
the best, followed by TileMap HMM and our method. TileHMM
performs the worst for the simulated low—resolution data with an
extremely large false positive rate. This can be seen from Figure 5B,
D and F, where the corresponding curves are almost ﬂat and close
to the horizontal axis. For the low—resolution data, the deteriorated
performance of the these methods with increase of the background
noise is quite understandable, because the enriched regions typically
contain only a few probes, and are thus more easily affected by the
norse.

5 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have presented a simple, but powerful Bayesian
hierarchical method to model ChIP—chip data through a hidden
ferromagnetic Ising model. This approach naturally takes into
account the intrinsic dependency of ChIP—chip data, and can be
used to analyze data with various genomic resolutions and sample
sizes. We comparatively evaluated our method and three closely
related methods using three real and various simulated datasets. The
results showed that our method performed as well as TileMap HMM
and BAC in terms of sensitivity and speciﬁcity in detecting IP—
enriched regions for the high—resolution data. However, our method
signiﬁcantly outperformed the alternatives for the low—resolution
data. The results showed that tileHMM did not work consistently.
It essentially failed for the p53, Nanog and Oct4 data because
it was not able to distinguish enriched and non—enriched probes
(see Figs 2, 3 and Table 1). The regions detected by tileHMM
are obviously dominated by false positives. However, it worked
as well as the three alternative methods on the simulated high—
resolution data (Fig. 5A, C and E). For the simulated low—resolution
data, tileHMM had extremely high false positive rates at various
posterior probability cutoffs (Fig. 5B, D and F). Since all the four
methods essentially make efforts to estimate the state (enriched
or non—enriched) of each probe, ideally it is expected that probe—
level posterior probabilities should be dichotomized, either close to
1 (for the enriched state) or 0 (for the non—enriched state), which
can be used as a criterion for evaluating the performance of these
methods. In terms of dichotomization, our method performed the
best, followed by TileMap HMM and BAC, and tileHMM performed
the worst.

The three alternative methods used for comparison in this article
are closely related to the Ising model we use. The Markov model is
essentially a 1D Ising model (for details see Kindermann and Snell,
1980). Vice versa, the model we proposed can also be treated as a
HMM in which the transition matrix is determined by the interaction
parameter 6, and the emission probabilities are determined by the
Equation (9). In addition, the Gaussian intrinsic auto—regression
model used by Gottardo et al. (2008) can also be viewed as a
continuous extension of the Ising model.

Since all the four methods basically use the same idea to model
ChIP—chip data, why does our method outperform the others for
the low—resolution data? This could be owed to the way we model
the data and the algorithm used for parameter estimation. In our
method, Metropolis within Gibbs sampling algorithm is used to
estimate the model parameters, which is known to converge to their
target distributions when the number of iterations becomes large.

ChIP-chip data analysis

 

Our method allows for a more precise estimation of the model
parameters, which in turn, leads to an improvement in detecting IP—
enriched regions. In contrast, tileHMM is a non—Bayesian method,
where the parameters are estimated using the Baum—Welch and/or
Viterbi training algorithm. It is known that the Baum—Welch
algorithm tends to converge to a local maximum of the likelihood
function, and the Viterbi training algorithm may not even converge
to the local maximum. The inconsistent performance of tileHMM on
the real and simulated data indicates that the inferiority of tileHMM
is mainly due to its training algorithm. In TileMap HMM, the model
parameter estimation is typically ad hoc. It assigns a ﬁxed value to
the transition probability from an enriched probe i to a non—enriched
probe i—l—l if the two adjacent probes are in a predeﬁned window
with certain genomic distance. For example, for the array with
35 bp resolution and average DNA fragments ~1000 bp, TileMap
HMM sets the transition probability to 1/28 because it assumes
that typical IP—enriched regions contain about 28 probes and 1/28
matches the mean length of a segment in an enriched region. In
addition, TileMap HMM tends to be conservative in detecting IP—
enriched regions. BAC models the spatial dependency of probes
via a Gaussian intrinsic auto—regression model, as aforementioned,
which can be viewed as a continuous extension of the Ising model.
To further make use of information of neighboring probes, Gottardo
et al. (2008) included in BAC an extra step to estimate the joint
posterior probability of the probes in a sliding window. However, as
demonstrated by our numerical examples, this off—model remedy is
not very effective, especially for the low—resolution data. In addition,
BAC directly models the probe intensity using a mixed—effect model.
It assumes that each probe has a probe— speciﬁc background intensity,
enrichment effect and random error. As a result, there are a huge
number of parameters needed to be estimated, which not only
signiﬁcantly increases the computational burden but also makes
the model potentially over—ﬁtted, especially when the number of
replicates is small.

In summary, we have proposed a hidden ferromagnetic Ising
model for ChIP—chip data analysis. The proposed method models
the data in a fully Bayesian framework, which enables the model
parameters to be estimated in a precise way. This overcomes the
difﬁculty in parameter estimation for the existing HMM methods,
leading to a signiﬁcant improvement in detecting IP—enriched
regions, especially for the low—resolution data. In contrast, the
parameter estimation in most of the existing HMM methods, is
typically either ad hoc or suboptimal. BAC also models the ChIP—
chip data in a fully Bayesian framework. Compared with BAC, our
model is much simpler and the computational burden is signiﬁcantly
reduced. For example, for a dataset with 500 000 probes, to run
15 000 iterations on a 64—bit Linux machine with 2.4 GHz CPU, our
method needed ~15 min, but BAC needed ~20 h. In addition, our
method makes little assumptions about the size of the IP—enriched
regions, and it can be used for the data with various levels of genomic
resolution.

Finally, we would like to point out that, with minor modiﬁcations,
the proposed method may be applicable to other spatially correlated
data such as ChIP—seq data (see, e.g. Park, 2009 for a review).
To accommodate the discreteness of ChIP—seq data, a Poisson—like
model can be used for the summary measurement Y.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Large numbers of long intergenic non-coding RNA
(lincRNA) have been detected through high-throughput sequencing
technology. However, currently we still know very little about their
functions. Therefore, a lincRNA function annotation database is
needed to facilitate the study in this field. In this article, we present
Linc2GO, a web resource that aims to provide comprehensive func-
tional annotations for human lincRNA. MicroRNA-mRNA and
microRNA-lincRNA interaction data were integrated to generate
lincRNA functional annotations based on the ‘competing endogenous
RNA hypothesis’. To the best of our knowledge, Linc2GO is the first
database that makes use of the ‘competing endogenous RNA hypoth-
esis’ to predict lincRNA functions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Long intergenic non-coding RNAs (lincRNAs) are endogenous
long non-coding RNA molecules that transcribed from
‘intergenic’ regions of the genome. In recent years, as high-
throughput sequencing technology developed, more and more
lincRNA have been identiﬁed (Guttman et al., 2009; Pauli
et al., 2012; Young et al., 2012).

It has been demonstrated that lincRNAs play critical roles in
regulating multiple important biological processes (Guttman
et al., 2011; Guttman and Rinn, 2012; Khalil et al., 2009;
Moran et al., 2012). However, currently most lincRNAs are
still poorly studied. Owing to the importance of lincRNA, it
has become very necessary to develop computational tools to
predict lincRNA functions. Previous researchers have proposed
a ‘co-expression—based’ method to predict lincRNA functions
and achieved many meaningful results (Guo et al., 2013; Liao
et al., 2011; Loewer et al., 2010). That is, if a lincRNA is co-
expressed with a protein-coding gene whose function is already
known, then the lincRNA is predicted to take similar functions.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

In this article, we predict lincRNA functions in a rather dif-
ferent approach and present Linc2GO, a novel lincRNA func-
tion annotation database. Instead of using the co-expression
information of lincRNA and protein coding-gene, our work is
based on the competing endogenous RNA hypothesis (ceRNA
hypothesis): lincRNA can function as microRNA ‘sponge’ to
interact directly with microRNA and prevent them from binding
to mRNA. In this way, lincRNA regulates gene expression and
meanwhile regulates the biological processes in which they get
involved in (Salmena et al. 2011; Zhao et al., 2008). For example,
MAMLl and MEF2C are two important transcription factors
that activate muscle-speciﬁc gene expression. Marcella Cesana
et al. showed that a lincRNA, linc-MDl, regulates muscle dif-
ferentiation by interacting with two microRNAs, miR-l35 and
miR-l33, which can bind to MAMLl and MEF2C to regulate
their expressions (Cesana et al., 2011). Based on the above fact, it
is natural to infer that if a lincRNA and an mRNA share some
microRNAs that can interact with both of them, then the two
have similar biological functions.

2 METHODS

We downloaded three microRNA-mRNA interaction datasets predicted
by three different algorithms: TargetScan (Bartel, 2007; Lewis et al.,
2005), miRanda (Betel et al., 2010) and PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007).
Then we integrated them into one dataset, which is much more accurate
(See Supplementary Material). Finally, we got 1218961 microRNA-
mRNA interactions.

Human lincRNAs are from “Human lincRNA Catalog” (Cabili et al.,
2011). All lincRNA sequences were downloaded from UCSC genome
browser. MicroRNA sequences were downloaded from miRBase
(Kozomara and Grifﬁths-Jones, 2011). The miRanda software is used
to predict microRNA-lincRNA interactions with default parameters.
We ﬁnally got 2 198 132 human microRNA-lincRNA interactions.

Having acquired the microRNA-mRNA and microRNA-lincRNA
interaction data, we followed the principle and workﬂow shown in
Figure l to generate lincRNA functional annotations.

First, for each ceRNA-ceRNA pair (the ceRNA-ceRNA pairs here
include lincRNA-mRNA pairs, mRNA-mRNA pairs and lincRNA-
lincRNA pairs), hypergeometric distribution was used to measure
whether the two ceRNAs signiﬁcantly share some microRNAs that can
interact with both of them. The P—value was calculated as:

x—l L N—L
P=1_Z(l)g\1f"—l)
[—0 (M)
where N is the total number of microRNA, M is the number of

microRNAs that interact with the ﬁrst ceRNA, L is the number of
microRNAs that interact with the second ceRNA and x is the number

of microRNAs that interact with both of them. Only the ceRNA-ceRNA
pairs with a small P-value (FDR <0.05) were kept for further analyses.

Next, we combined the kept ceRNA-ceRNA pairs to generate a
‘ceRNA network’ with network nodes represented by ceRNA (either
lincRNA or mRNA), and the two ceRNAs presented in the same
ceRNA-ceRNA pair were connected by an edge. For each lincRNA in
the ceRNA network, we collected all its mRNA neighbors and mapped
them to corresponding genes, getting a gene set. GO enrichment analysis
and KEGG enrichment analysis were then applied to the gene set. The
ﬁnal generated GO terms and KEGG pathway terms were assigned to
the lincRNA as its functional annotation.

3 RESULTS

In the finally generated functional annotations, there were 7202
lincRNAs that were assigned with at least one GO BP term. We
did a detailed analysis of GO BP terms and showed that
lincRNAs play critical roles in multiple biological processes
such as nervous system processes, cellular development, cell-cell
communication, biological adhesion, cellular component organ-
ization and so on (see Supplementary Material). As we know,
Linc2GO is the ﬁrst database that provides comprehensive
human lincRNA function annotations.

The Linc2GO has provided a user-friendly interface to access
functional annotations (See Supplementary Fig. S1). Three add-
itional text ﬁles in csv format that contain all predicted func-
tional annotations are also downloadable to provide
convenient access in computational projects.

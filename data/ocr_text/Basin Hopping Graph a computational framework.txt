ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA folding is a complicated kinetic process. The min-
imum free energy structure provides only a static view of the most
stable conformational state of the system. It is insufficient to give de-
tailed insights into the dynamic behavior of RNAs. A sufficiently
sophisticated analysis of the folding free energy landscape, however,
can provide the relevant information.

Results: We introduce the Basin Hopping Graph (BHG) as a novel
coarse-grained model of folding landscapes. Each vertex of the
BHG is a local minimum, which represents the corresponding basin
in the landscape. Its edges connect basins when the direct transitions
between them are ‘energetically favorable’. Edge weights endcode the
corresponding saddle heights and thus measure the difficulties of
these favorable transitions. BHGs can be approximated accurately
and efficiently for RNA molecules well beyond the length range ac-
cessible to enumerative algorithms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Much of RNA’s functional complexity is rooted not only in the
details of its intricate 3D structure but also in its ability to adap-
tively acquire distinct conformations on its own or in response to
speciﬁc cellular signals including the recognition of proteins, nu-
cleic acids, metal ions, metabolites, vitamins, changes in tempera-
ture and even RNA biosynthesis itself. These conformational
transitions are spatially and temporally tuned to achieve a variety
of functions. The most obvious examples are riboswitches
(Baumstark et al., 1997; Perrotta and Been, 1998; Schultes and

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Bartel, 2000) and RNA thermometers (Klinkert and
Narberhaus, 2009; Narberhaus et al., 2006).

The intricate structures of RNAs are typically modeled to a
reasonable approximation in terms of secondary structures
(Thirumalai et al., 2001). This is because the thermal melting
data (thermodynamic free energy model) of secondary structures
have been interpreted by a nearest-neighbor model (Mathews
et al., 1999, 2004) and form the basis for widely used structure
prediction algorithms that predict secondary structure with rea-
sonable accuracy (Hofacker, 2003; Zuker, 2003; Zuker and
Sankoff, 1984). In particular, the partition function of the
Boltzmann ensemble of secondary structures for a given RNA
sequence can be computed in cubic time using a well-known
dynamic programming approach (McCaskill, 1990). Thus, a sto-
chastic backtracking algorithm (Ding and Lawrence, 2003) can
be used to produce representative structures and to generate
Boltzmann-weighted samples to assess complex structural fea-
tures like base pair probabilities.

The inclusion of pseudoknots and other tertiary contacts into
RNA structure prediction remains time-consuming and technic-
ally challenging (Das and Baker, 2007; Rivas and Eddy, 1999;
Rother et al., 2011; Smit et al., 2009). In its most general form,
the problem is NP-complete (Manuch et al., 2011). Furthermore,
free energy models for pseudoknots are based on sparse experi-
mental data and hence are crude at best. Nevertheless, secondary
structures with pseudoknots can be important for the dynamics
of folding (Isambert and Siggia, 2000). Owing to the journal’s
length restrictions, we focus on the Boltzmann ensemble of sec-
ondary structures in the main text and relegate the extension to
structures with pseudoknots to Supplementary Material Part H.
For brevity, we will speak of the ‘energy’ instead of ‘free energy’
of a secondary structure.

The kinetic process of RNA folding can be described as a
dynamic process in the molecule’s energy landscape (Flamm
et al., 2002). The energy landscape is a particular network
whose vertices represent all the possible structures and whose
edges connect structures that can be interconverted by elemen-
tary rearrangements, typically the opening or closing of individ-
ual base pairs. For each structure as a vertex in the landscape, its
energy is evaluated based on the thermodynamic energy model
(Mathews et al., 1999) for characterizing its dynamical state.

Thus, the transition rates between adjacent secondary structures
can be estimated by the Metropolis rule (Flamm et al., 2000;
Xayaphoummine et al., 2007). In this setting, the RNA folding
process is viewed as a Markov chain, and the transition rates
between two adjacent structures in the landscape are related with
their energy differences. Typically, different structural transitions
are of different rates as observed by Smit et al. (2007), which is
consistent with the thermodynamic picture: the equilibrium dis-
tribution of this Markov process coincides with the Boltzmann
distribution of the secondary structures.

The number of different secondary structures, however, makes
it impossible to enumerate the entire landscape except for short
sequences, so that one has to resort to coarse-grained approxi-
mations. The barrier tree of the landscape, Figure 1B, encodes
the local minima and their connecting energy barriers. The idea
to elucidate the basin structure of a landscape by means of a
barrier tree has been developed independently in different con-
texts, including potential energy surfaces for protein folding
(Garstecki et al., 1999; Wales, 2011), spin glasses (Klotz and
Kobe, 1994) and molecular clusters (Doye et al., 1999). The
exact computation of barrier trees in general requires the enu-
meration of the landscape. For RNA secondary structures, a
modification of the backtracking step in the dynamic program-
ming folding algorithm can be used to enumerate only the
lowest-lying fraction of the landscapes (VVuchty et al., 1999).
However, even within this favorable setting, barrier trees are ac-
cessible only for RNA molecules with up to ~100 nt.

An alternative to the exact construction of barrier trees is the
use of heuristic approaches. For example, Tang et al. (2008)
adopted computational techniques for motion planning in ro-
botics to obtain an approximated representation of the RNA
folding landscape. A different type of coarse graining can be
obtained by conditioning the folding algorithms on the distances
from two reference points, resulting in a kind of 2D ‘projection’
of the landscape (Lorenz et al., 2009). Heuristic methods are also
used to (locally) navigate the optimal folding path between two
given structures. For instance, f indpath (Flamm et al., 2000) is
a fast algorithm that produces excellent quality direct pathways
based on the Morgan—Higgs algorithm (Morgan and Higgs,
1998). Furthermore, RNAtabupath (Dotu et al., 2010) and its
related web server, RNApathfinc'ler, used a tabu semi-greedy
heuristic to determine nearly optimal folding pathways between
two given secondary structures. Lorenz et al. (2009) developed a

The difficult part in computing coarse graining models such as
barrier trees is to determine the saddle points. The local minima,
on the other hand, can be obtained efﬁciently by means of mod-
ified dynamic programming algorithms. This was demonstrated
first by Clote (2005) with respect to the Nussinov—Jacobson
energy model and later extended to the Turner energy model
by Lorenz and Clote (2011). Their extension of McCaskill’s al-
gorithm can be used to generate Boltzmann-weighted samples of
local minima. Empirically, they find that the number of local
optima is roughly the square root of the number of secondary
structures, i.e. it grows exponentially with chain length. Exact
combinatorial results have been derived by Fusy and Clote
(2012) for the base stacking energy model, which is a variant
of the Nussinov model, where each stacked base pair contributes
—1 toward the energy of the structure.

Hence, for large RNAs, one still has to resort to sampling.
Boltzmann-weighted samples are not necessarily the most effi-
cient way to explore the basin structure of the landscape because
they are strongly biased toward usually small fraction of low
energy structures. Sahoo and Albrecht (2012) thus considered a
stochastic sampling method to obtain local minima within a
prescribed distance of a reference structure: random structures
are iteratively improved by gradient (down-hill) walks until local
minima are reached. Such samples can be used to estimate the
total number of local minima following the arguments of
Garnier and Kallel (2000).

The remainder of this contribution is organized as follows. In
Sections 2.1 and 2.2, we first introduce the basic concepts and
existing results in the field of RNA folding landscapes. In Section
2.3, we introduce the ‘Basin Hopping Graph’ (BHG) as a new
coarse graining model of the energy landscape and then describe
algorithms for its construction. In Section 3, we present and
discuss our experimental results. Section 4 summarizes the article
and suggests directions for future work.

2 THEORY

2.1 RNA folding landscapes

Given an RNA sequence a, let X: X, denote the set of all
secondary structures that can be formed by 0 assuming that (i)
only canonical (GC, AU and GU) base pairs are formed, (ii) base
pairs do not cross, i.e. pseudoknots are not formed, and (iii)
hairpin loops have a minimum length of 3. These conditions
define the ensemble of structures implemented in the most com-
monly used RNA folding tools including mfolc'l (Zuker and
Sankoff, 1984) and the ViennaRNA Package (Hofacker
et al., 1994; Lorenz et al., 2011). It is well known that the car-
dinality |Xa| grows exponentially with the length of o [(Hofacker
et al., 1996) and the references therein] provided the stickiness of
o, i.e. the probability that two arbitrarily chosen nucleotides in a
can form a base pair, is relatively large. This is true for most
biological RNA sequences, as the values of stickiness for RNAs
are around 0.375 (Hofacker et al., 1994).

This set of discrete conformations is arranged as a graph by
deﬁning a ‘move set’, i.e. by specifying which pairs of secondary
structures can be interconverted in a single step [(Reidys and

Stadler, 2002) and the references therein]. Figure 1A gives a
simple example. Each vertex of the RNA folding landscape,
i.e. each RNA secondary structure x, is associated with an
energy f(x). A well-established energy model allows us to expli-
citly compute ﬁx) for every structure x in terms of additive con-
tributions for base pair stacking as well as hairpin loops, interior
loops, bulges and multiloops (Mathews et al., 1999).

2.2 Local minima, saddles and basins

A secondary structure x e X is a local minimum (LM) of the
landscape if it does not have neighbors with lower energy. In
particular, x is a global minimum or a minimum free energy struc-
ture (MFE) if its energy is minimal within X. For each LM x, we
deﬁne its gradient basin G(x) C X as the set of structures 2 e X so
that the unique gradient walk with starting point in 2 ends in x.
We note for later reference that the gradient basins of all the
LMs in the RNA folding landscape forms a partition of its con-
ﬁguration space X. This partitioning forms an intuitive coarse-
grained model of the landscape.

An important concept for our own approach is the direct
saddle. A direct saddle between two LMs x and y is a structure
s e X with minimal energy so that both x and y are reachable
from s by means of an adaptive walk. We call DS(x, y) = f(s) the
direct saddle height between x and y. Not every pair of LMs is
connected by direct saddles. However, the graph consisting of
LMs and their connections by direct saddles is always connected
(Supplementary Material Part A; Klemm et al., 2014).

The cycle Bh(x) of x at energy level n can be deﬁned as a
maximal connected subset of {z e X [f(z) g b} that contains x.
In other words, Bh(x) is the set of structures found by a ﬂooding
algorithm starting at x (Flamm et al., 2000, 2002; Sibani et al.,
1999). In particular, the basin B(s) = Bﬂs) (s) of s (Flamm et al.,
2002) is the set of all points in X that can be reached from s by a
path whose elevation never exceeds f(s).

The saddle height S(x, y) between any two vertices x and y is
the minimal value b for which y e Bh(x). In other words, S(x, y)
is the level at which two cycles Bh(x) and Bh (y) ‘merge’. If x and
y are LMs connected by a direct saddle point, then
S(x, y) g DS(x, y). A structure s e X is called a saddle between
x, y e X if (i) f(s) = S(x, y) and (ii) there is a path P connecting x
and y so that f(s) Z f(z) for all z e P. A path P* connecting x
and y in the landscape is energetically optimal if
maxZE 13* f(2) = S(x, y). Energetically optimal paths are not neces-
sarily unique (Supplementary Material Part C). For RNA fold-
ing landscapes, the problems of computing saddle heights, saddle
points and the energetically optimal path are NP-hard (Manuch
et al., 2011).

It has been proven in (Flamm et al., 2002) that for any two
saddles s’ and s”, B(s’) g B(s”), B(s”) g B(s’) or B(s”) ﬂ B(s’) = 0
is satisﬁed, i.e. the basins below saddles of a landscape form a
hierarchy with respect to set inclusion order (Supplementary
Material Part B). Because the landscape is connected, this hier-
archical structure is naturally represented by a tree called barrier
tree (Flamm et al., 2002; Wolﬁnger et al., 2004). The leaves and
interior nodes of this tree correspond to the LMs and their saddle
points, respectively.

The barrier tree can be computed using a ﬂooding algorithm
(Flamm et al., 2000; Sibani et al., 1999) implemented, e.g. in the

program barriers (Flamm et al., 2002). It takes an energy
sorted list of structures as input. This list may contain either
all structures or only the structures below some threshold
energy. The only part of barriers that relies on the geometric
properties of the conﬁguration space is the routine that generates
all neighbors of each structure in the list. Therefore, barriers
has a time complexity of 0(A x K), where A denotes the max-
imum number of neighbors for a structure in the landscape, and
K denotes the number of structures in the input list. For the
technical complications arising from degeneracy in the land-
scape, see Flamm et al. (2002).

The barrier tree abstraction has two major disadvantages: (i) It
neglects much of the geometric information of the folding land-
scape because the neighborhood relation between basins is
ignored as illustrated in Figure 2. (ii) The high computational
cost makes it unfeasible in practice for RNA molecules with a
length >100 nt.

2.3 The Basin Hopping Graph

2.3.] Definition The BHG has been devised to overcome these
shortcomings. The basic idea is to incorporate additional neigh-
borhood information by considering LMs as adjacent if the tran-
sition between their corresponding basins is ‘energetically
optimal’. For two given LMs x and y, the condition energetically
optimal requires that their direct saddle height is equal to their
saddle height, i.e. DS(x, y) = S(x, y). A schematic diagram of the
BHG for a toy landscape is illustrated in Figure 2, in which, the
transition from A to B on Figure 2 is energetically optimal, as
S(A, B) = DS(A, B) = 0, but the transition from A to D is not, as
0.5 = DS(A, D) >S(A, D) = 0.

We focus on the energetically optimal transitions because, on
one hand as proven in Supplementary Material Lemma S1, the
energetically optimal paths connecting two local minima x and y
can be represented as a concatenation of energetically optimal
transitions between neighboring basins. In Figure 2, for example,
there are two energetically optimal paths between A and D:
A —> B —> D and A —> C —> D. Both paths are composed of

Fig. 2. A landscape with four local minima (A, B, C, and D) is illustrated
in the left hand side. Its corresponding barrier tree (top) and BHG
(bottom) are shown on the right hand side with saddle heights annotated

are all equal to 0 kcal/mol. Regarding direct saddle heights, except
DS(A,D) = DS(B, C) = 0.5kcal/mol, the rest are all of value 0kcal/mol.
One key difference is that the energetically favorable neighborhood rela-
tion between the basins can be displayed in the BHG but not in the
barrier tree

optimal transitions between neighbored basins (A,B), (B, D),
(A, C) and (C, D).

On the other hand, a key observation is that the ‘energetically
optimal’ transitions are usually rare and hence the BHG is a
fairly sparse graph. Therefore, the BHG may be the minimal
‘information container’ that is able to track the energetically op-
timal paths between any two local minima in the RNA land-
scape. We have shown in Figure 2 that the barrier tree fails to
track the optimal path between A and D. In Supplementary
Material Part C, we further prove inductively that the barrier
tree is equivalent to the dendrogram obtained from the BHG by
single linkage clustering.

The BHG could be constructed by enumeration and ﬂooding
in a manner similar to the barrier tree. Instead, we describe an
efﬁcient heuristic that allows us to overcome the stringent length
restrictions imposed by enumerative approaches. The procedure
consists of two largely independent components: (i) The
RNAlocmin program generates a sample set of LMs within a
user-deﬁned energy range above the MFE. This component re-
places the exhaustive enumeration of all low energy states. (ii)
The BHGbuilc'ler algorithm is then used to estimate direct
saddle points and to determine the BHG adjacency on the
input set of LMs. As we show below, the vertex and edge weights
can be estimated along the way.

2.3.2 RNAlocmin The basic idea of RNAlocmin is straightfor-
ward: it samples a start structure and then uses a gradient walk to
determine the corresponding LM. The main technical difﬁculty is
to make the sampling part efﬁcient. Boltzmann sampling, as im-
plemented in RNAsubopt —p or sf old (Ding and Lawrence,
2003; Ding et al., 2004), predominantly yields structures close to
the MFE, which are frequently transported to the global min-
imum or one of the other local optima with low energy.

To avoid this kind of oversampling, we resort to the idea
underlying Simulated Annealing and modify the Boltzmann
weights by an extra scaling factor S that artiﬁcially increases
the sample temperature:

Pas) = eﬁ/Q. (1)

where Q the correspondingly modiﬁed partition function and S
serves as a normalization factor. A change of the thermodynamic
temperature T also affects the RNA energy parameters, which
are free energy contributions (Mathews et al., 1999), and hence
affects f(s) in a biased manner. It is necessary, therefore, to be
able to vary the thermodynamic temperature and the sample
temperature S independently. For S = l we obtain regular
Boltzmann ensembles, for S—> 00 we approach uniform sam-
pling of X. The implementations of the partition function algo-
rithms of the ViennaRNA Package have been modiﬁed to
provide this option from version 2.0.3 on.

Because we are interested in the LMs within a prescribed
energy increment above the MFE, it pays to adjust S accordingly.
Instead of a ﬁxed optimal S, we use an adaptive S-schedule,
which prefers LMs with relatively low energies. As the thermo-
dynamic energy model of RNAs is strongly dependent on the
input sequence, we ﬁrst estimate the expected energies as a func-
tion of S. To this end, we obtain a set of LMs from 1000 sampled
structures and tabulate the average energy of the LMs for each

structures with the lowest energies

S = 0.4 —I— k x 0.1 in which an integer k ranges over the interval
[0, 21], Figure 3 (top). From these values we obtain an estimate
e(S) for the expected free energy by linear interpolation. In prin-
ciple, one could precompute these tables for various sequence
compositions. We found, however, that the computational over-
head to estimate these values for each input is tolerable in prac-
tice. Alternatively, one could also estimate the e(S) ‘on the ﬂy’
from the already sampled LMs.

From each sampled structure s, we obtain the corresponding
LM x via a gradient walk starting from s. In practice, the imple-
mentation does not completely evaluate candidate structures but
considers the energy increments for opening and closing individ-
ual base pairs, each of which can be obtained by three lookups
from the tabulated energy model. For each LM x, the number
q(x) of gradient walks terminating in x is recorded to keep track
of sampling efﬁciency. Sahoo and Albrecht (2012) introduced a
heuristic criterion designed to avoid reaching the same LM too
many times from different initial random starting points. They
propose that the sampling is sufﬁcient when most of the minima
have been seen at least twice. We modify this rule and stipulate
that sampling is sufﬁcient up to energy level e if 6? << 5;, where
6; denotes the number of minima with an energy less than e that
have been detected at least once and at most k times
(6; = |{x|l g q(x) g k; E(x)<e}|). The rule of (Sahoo and
Albrecht, 2012) and its energy-dependent variants are empirically
well supported (see also Section 3) but so far lack a good theor-
etical justiﬁcation.

To turn the rule into an operational criterion, we determine, at
a given step of the sample procedure, the smallest energy cutoff e
so that 66 3 116;, where the so-called convergence parameter ,u
is a user-deﬁned threshold, set to ,u = 0.1 by default. The energy
e is then interpreted as the desired expected energy for the next
sampling epoch. The corresponding value of S is obtained from
the precomputed table mentioned above. RNAlocmin continues
until the energy e exceeds the user-deﬁned upper bound or if the
requested number of iterations have been done.

The time complexity of RNAlocmin is composed of two parts.
First, samples have to be gathered by RNAsubopt, and then

Fig. 4. Iterative path construction in BHGbuilder. First, an initial path
x —> 171 —> - - - —> p7 —> y is computed with ﬁndpath for the ﬁrst pair of
LMs (x, y) in the priority queue B. The base pair distance between x and
y is 8. Next, the gradient walks starting from {p1, . . . , p7} determine three
consecutive LMs v1, v4 and v6. Thus, the adjacent pairs (x, v1), (v1, V4),
(V4, v6) and (v6, y) are inserted into B for the next iteration

gradient walks have to be constructed for each sample. The time
complexity of an average gradient walk is 0(n2), where n is the
length of the sequence. We are dealing mainly with highly folded
structures and they tend to only have small number of insertions
possible, and therefore, these structures have 0(n) neighbors.
Recomputing their energy is in 0(1) steps as mentioned earlier,
and the gradient walk has at most 0(n) steps on RNA land-
scapes. For each value of S, we have a setup cost of 0(n3) for
the forward recursion of McCaskill’s algorithms and 0(n2) to
generate a sample. The complexity of the latter step could be
reduced to 0(n log n) using the Boustrophedon method (Ponty,
2008). As the sampling step is already dominated by the effort
for the gradient walk, we retained the simpler implementation.
The total time complexity is then 0(1 - n3 + N - n2), where I is the
number of S-sampling epochs and N is the total number of
sampled structures.

For performance evaluation, we generated samples of 10 ran-
domly generated RNA sequences with uniform nucleotide com-
position for each length from 60 to 500 (Supplementary Material
Part D Fig. S2). For each sequence, LMs are generated from at
most 105 start structures for each value of S. Computations were
performed on an Intel Xeon CPU E5450 3.00 GHz.

2.3.3 BHGbuilder BHGbuilder aims to determine the BHG
adjacency and the corresponding edge weights (saddle heights)
between these adjacent LMs. Initially, all pairs of LMs are
arranged in a priority queue B by increasing base pair distance.
Then BHGbuilder uses an iterative procedure to determine the
BHG-adjacent LMs: for each pair of LMs in 8, (i) an initial path
73 = (x = p0,p1, pIII = y) is computed with some existing
heuristic path-ﬁnding algorithm. Our implementation uses
f indpath (Flamm et al., 2000) provided by the ViennaRNA
Package as the default underlying algorithm (alternatives such
as Pathfinder could be used as well); (ii) an iterative re-
evaluation procedure (Fig. 4) is used to improve 73. At each

when L is empty and returns an approximation of the BHG

RNA sequences of lengths 60—500. The crosses annotate the time
points when S get updated

in the path-construction step. Its edges are the BHG adjacencies
as outlined above. Finally, a double-sided ﬂooding procedure
(optional) is called to further improve the edge weights between
two BHG-adjacent vertices. Here, an exact saddle can be dis-
covered by enumerating the structures in these two adjacent
basins if the number of structures enumerated does not overcome
a certain threshold.

BHGbuilder has a time complexity of 0(P - M2 + E - K - n),
where terms capture the above described algorithm and the
ﬂooding of the resulting pairs of LMs: P is the time complexity
of one run of the underlying path-ﬁnding algorithm, 0(n2) in the
case of f indpath; M is number of LMs in the input, E ~ M
denotes the number of edges in the BHG as an output; K denotes
the maximal number of additional structures appearing in the
ﬂooding procedure and 0(n) is the average time complexity to
compute the neighborhood for each structure. Therefore,
the time complexity of BHGbuilder with findpath is
0(M2-n2+M-K-n).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 RNAlocmin

Figure 5 summarizes the sampling schedule and the size-weighted
fraction of undetected basins as a function of invested CPU time.
Not surprisingly, the sampling times to reach a given level of
coverage of the landscape increase with sequence length. This
is an obvious consequence of the exponential increase in the
number of LMs. Nevertheless, the adaptive S schedule is effective
because for different RNA lengths, the speed of ﬁnding new LMs
remains stable, i.e. the number of detected LMs grows linearly
with respect to the running time (shown in the Supplementary
Material Part D Fig. S2).

Figure 5 (right) shows that for sequence lengths up to 500 nt,
RNAlocmin is able to ﬁnd a collection of LMs whose combined
basin sizes cover more than two-thirds of the search space within
200s. For sequences shorter than 300 nt, this fraction increases
to 80%. Similar results are obtained from biological RNA se-
quences and collected in Supplementary Material Part E Figures
S3—Sll.

To compare the performance of RNAlocmin with
RNAlocopt (Lorenz and Clote, 2011), we allocate the same
CPU time to both programs and evaluate the total number of
detected LMs and the size-weighted fraction of undiscovered

3.2 BHGbuilder

3.2.1 Approximated BHG versus Barrier tree In Figure 7, we
compared the BHG (top) and the barrier tree (bottom) for the
RNA molecule 5’-GUGUCGCUUUCGAUUAAGGACCUAC
AACAGGCU—3’. To highlight the difference between the barrier
tree and the BHG, we consider the refolding pathway between (i)
the MFE and (ii) the next-lowest LM. Both structures readily
allow us to read off the saddle height as 1.9 kcal/mol. The BHG
shows that there are two alternative optimal pathways
l—>ll—>5—>l7—>9—>8—>2 and l—>ll—>5—>l7—>
9 —> 3 —> 2. The barrier tree provides a much more ambiguous
picture. It suggests a refolding pathway climbing to the saddle
separating LM 1 and LM 2 but does not provide any indication
of the intermediate states. The path backtracking procedure im-
plemented in barriers can identify the ﬁrst folding pathway.
Owing to the inherent tree topology, however, it is not possible
to also ﬁnd the alternative connection. We note here, this path
backtracking procedure is limited to RNA molecules 100nt only,
as the number of optimal paths is usually too big.

There are pairs of LMs that are not connected by an energet-
ically optimal path but are still BHG adjacent. An example is
LM 1 and LM 5 in Figure 7, which are adjacent in the BHG
while 1.6 = S(l, 5) <DS(l, 5) = 3.2. These cases appear when the
underlying path-searching algorithm misses the optimal solution
for the initial path. In practice, these ‘energetically suboptimal’
paths rarely hurt the computation of the saddle height, which is
calculated only after the entire BHG, and hence the competing
indirect paths, have been determined. As these paths usually
reduce the graph distance at the expense of a small energy pen-
alty, such paths may still be relevant for the folding kinetics. One
might want to consider an optimization criterion that involves

both path length and energy instead of just peak energy along the
path as we do here.

3.2.2 Approximation of saddle heights BHGbuilder is a heur-
istic algorithm and thus will in general only ﬁnd upper bounds of
saddle heights. For moderate-size RNAs, a direct comparison
with exact values obtained from barriers is possible. For
larger molecules, we compare with other heuristics. In particular,
it is interesting to check whether the construction of the BHG
brings a further improvement of the saddle heights compared
with the path construction heuristic findpath alone. Because
BHGbuilder uses findpath for its initial estimates of saddle
heights, it is of course guaranteed that Sbmiersbc, y) g

BHGbuilder over f indpath are mostly a consequence of
the inclusion of additional LMs such as (17) in Figure 7 (top),
which is necessary for the optimal path. In Figure 8, we use two
snRNAs as examples, the 107 nt U6 snRNA of Melitaea cinxia
and the 166 nt Ul snRNA of the mouse. For U6, we sample 1000
LMs and determine the exact saddle heights between all pairs by
ﬂooding with RNAsubopt/barriers. The saddle point esti-
mates are similar in this case, with BHGbuilder obtaining the

Fig. 8. Comparison of the saddle height estimates of BHGbuilder and
f indpath for Melitaea cinxia U6 snRNA JX878560.1 (107 nt) and the
Mus musculus U1 snRNA NR_004413.2 (166 nt). Here, the x-axes denote
the indices of LM-pairs, which are sorted according to their saddle
heights in an increasing order and the y-axes are the corresponding
saddle heights (kcal/mol) estimations derived from different methods.
The inset shows the difference in saddle heights between BHGbuilder
and f indpath

exact values and only small errors of up to 0.1kcal/mol in
~7.4% of the pairs for f indpath. For the 166 nt mouse Ul
snRNA, however, an exact computation with barriers
already exceeds our hardware limitations. The direct comparison
of BHGbuilder and f indpath yields a moderate improve-
ment of on average 0.8 kcal/mol for almost half of the pairs
of LMs.

BHGbuilder performs equally well or better than f indpath
in all 10 examples of Supplementary Material Part F Figures
Sl2—S2l. For three cases, we ﬁnd substantial improvements of
the saddle point energies that can help to derive more exact RNA
kinetic parameters. In seven cases, only small or no improve-
ments were obtained. Still, the adjacency information generated
by BHGbui lde r, can add further accuracy to kinetic parameters
in all cases because it provides information on alternative con-
nections between LMs; see Supplementary Material Part F for
details.

3.2.3 Prediction of folding pathways BHGbuilder can also be
used to predict the optimal folding path between a pair of user-
prescribed LMs. Here we make use of the iterative path improve-
ment step to elaborate on underlying folding path prediction
software such as findpath (Flamm et al., 2000),
RNAtabupath (Dotu et al., 2010) and Pathfinder (Lorenz
et al., 2009). In Table l, we compare BHGbuilder with find—
path, RNAtabupath and Pathfinder on 100 randomly gen-
erated instances with n = 200, i.e. well beyond the reach of exact
enumeration. Interestingly, the computationally expensive ﬂood-
ing step brings no improvement for this task. Pathfinder
nearly always obtains the path with the lowest peak height but
is more than two orders of magnitude slower.

3.2.4 SV11 RNA: a hard case The SV11 sequence is a particu-
larly hard test case for landscape-oriented algorithms because it
features a functional metastable state with high energy and a
high energy barrier. The 115nt SV11 RNA was discovered in
in vitro selection experiments as an excellent substrate for QB
replicase (Biebricher and Luce, 1992). It features a nearly palin-
dromic sequence with an extremely stable hairpin-like MFE
structure. Pulse-chase experiments showed that the active

distances from MFE and metastable structure are shown for a sample of
4 X 106 structures for RNAlocmin (A) and 108 structures for
RNAlocopt (B). The metastable basin is missed completely by
RNAlocopt. Panels (C) and (D) record the folding energy and base
pair distance from the MFE structure along the optimal (re)folding
path from the MFE to the metastable state as computed by
BHGbuilder. The x—axis is the number of structures along the path

conformation is a metastable structure formed during replica-
tion, while the MFE serves as a template for the QB replicase.
Melting experiments indicated that the metastable conformation
comprises two distinct stems (Biebricher and Luce, 1992).

The energy difference between the MFE and the metastable
conformation is 28.5 kcal/mol, well beyond the reach of exhaust-
ive enumeration. Boltzmann sampling is also inefﬁcient for such
large energy differences as well, hence RNAlocopt is still
trapped in the vicinity of the MFE after lh at a sample size of
108. During the same wall clock time, RNAlocmin (convergence
parameter ,0. = 0.8) found the metastable in a sample of 4 x 106
structures.

Figure 9A and B summarize the differences between
RNAlocopt and RNAlocmin in the base pair distance distribu-
tions of the LMs. While RNAlocopt found only 620 distinct
LMs, we obtained 2619 305 with RNAlocmin using a much
smaller sample size. Importantly, RNAlocmin covers not only
LMs near to MFE but also, due to the adaptive schedule, those
more distant LMs in energy and base pairing pattern.
RNAlocmin found the metastable stable state as the 365172th
LM w.r.t. energy.

BHGbuilder cannot process an input set of this size within
reasonable time. Most of the LMs, however, are not persistent.
They are either shallow or just ‘transition’ LMs with only two
neighbors in the ﬁnal BHG. Therefore, we selected from the
initial input set those that remains LM with respect to an ex-
panded move set that includes base pair shifts (VVuchty et al.,
1999). Now the metastable has rank ~6700 w.r.t. energy.
Starting from the 7000 lowest LMs w.r.t. to the expanded
move set and removing shallow LMs whose gradient basin has
an escape barrier <l.0 kcal/mol leaves an initial set of 2665 non-
shallow LMs as input. BHGbuilder constructs a BHG with
110593 vertices and 224666 edges in <20 h. The optimal folding
path connecting MFE to metastable state in the BHG has a
saddle height of —59.2kcal/mol. This is a 3.1kca1/mol improve-
ment over both f indpath and Pathfinder. We visualized
the optimal path by monitoring how the free energies and the
base pair distances (with MFE) vary along this path in Figure 9C
and D, respectively. With few exceptions, the base pair distance
monotonically decreases along the pathway. Interestingly, most
of these detours appear in close vicinity of high energy peaks,
which is potentially necessary to circle around the high energy
barriers.

4 CONCLUDING REMARKS

The BHG introduced here is a conceptually rigorous coarse
graining of a landscape comprising the LMs and those direct
saddle points between them that are also globally the most fa-
vorable connections. At the same time it is a reﬁnement of the
barrier tree, which can be obtained from the BHG by single
linkage clustering. It is not speciﬁc to RNA folding, which we
used as a concrete application here, but can be computed in
principle for any landscape.

The focus on the BHG adjacency captures the most likely
transitions between basins. Thus, when the BHG serves as a
basis for computing folding dynamics, one-step transition rate
[F’ny between any two given local minima x and y is approxi-
mated by an Arrhenius rule as [Pnyoce_S(x=y)/RT if x and y are
adjacent in the BHG and 0 otherwise. This improves on the
Arrhenius approximation for the barrier tree in which
[P’nyoce_S(x’y)/RT for each pair of local minima. Using Figure 2
as an example, in the BHG, any pathway from A to D needs to
pass through either B or C, and thus, it requires two steps to
refold from A to D. However, in a barrier tree, this is approxi-
mated as a one-step transition because it omits the geometric
information between two basins. This approximation will be
less accurate than the macro-state transition rates model outlined
by Wolﬁnger et al. (2004). For instance, the direct transition
between A and D in Figure 2 is neglected in the BHG model.
A toy kinetic example comparing the three discussed approaches

is presented in Supplementary Material Part G. The exponential
relation between energies and rates suggests that energetically
non-optimal direct transitions will play only a minor role com-
pared with pathways with multiple intermediates that all have
strictly smaller peak energies. This is true only for differences
larger than a few kT. To accommodate this point, we can replace
energetic optimality by a relaxed condition of the form
DS(x, y) — S(x, y) S AEe , which includes some suboptimal
direct transitions between basins to the BHG. It will be interest-
ing to see how the threshold AEef affects the folding kinetics. It is
computationally feasible to keep suboptimal transitions as long
as AEef is a small multiple of kT.

The BHG has been introduced with the explicit purpose of
allowing for an efﬁcient high-quality heuristic approximation
so as to overcome the stringent size limitations of the exact al-
gorithms. Empirically we ﬁnd that the combination of improved
sampling of low-energy local LMs with RNAlocmin, fast con-
struction of initial candidate saddles with f indpath and the
construction of the BHG by iterative path improvement with
BHGbuilder comes close to the exact solutions for small sys-
tems. At the same time, it extends the range at which RNA
folding landscapes can be studied to at least 300 nt, thus includ-
ing most structured RNAs of biological interest, such as RNAs
shown in Supplementary Material Part E and F. BHGbui lder is
also capable of exploring partial landscapes determined by the
input set of LMs. Therefore, it allows us to ‘zoom—in’ and focus
on the region of particular biological interest. The methods are
readily extended to pseudoknotted RNAs as shown in
Supplementary Material Part H. However, they become compu-
tationally much more demanding.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: We have implemented a coalescent simulation program
for a structured population with selection at a single diploid locus.
The program includes the functionality of the simulator ms to
model population structure and demography, but adds a model for
deme- and time-dependent selection using forward simulations. The
program can be used, e.g. to study hard and soft selective sweeps
in structured populations or the genetic footprint of local adaptation.
The implementation is designed to be easily extendable and widely
deployable. The interface and output format are compatible with ms.
Performance is comparable even with selection included.
Availability: The program is freely available from http://www.mabs
.at/ewing/msms/ along with manuals and examples. The source is
freely available under a GPL type license.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coalescent simulations are a standard method to generate population
samples under various models of evolution. The widely used
simulator ms (Hudson, 2002) is a powerful tool for genealogies
in general structured populations under neutrality, with high
performance and an easy to use interface. However, it does not allow
for selection. On the other hand, several programs are available to
simulate polymorphism data for a neutral locus linked to a selected
site (e. g. Kim and Stephan, 2002; Pennings and Hermisson, 2006b;
Spencer and Coop, 2004; Teshima and Innan, 2009), but they do not
allow for population structure. Only the speciﬁc scenario of selection
in a colony population that has split from a large founder population
without subsequent migration has been considered (Li and Stephan,
2006; Thornton and Jensen, 2006).

In msms, we implement the functionality of Hudson’s ms in
a simulator that allows for selection at a single diploid locus
with two alleles. For neutral genealogies, the program’s usage and
assumptions are identical to ms. In particular, msms is compatible
with ms in both output format and command—line options. This
permits the wide range of tools that work with ms to also
work with msms. Complicated models can now have selection
added with only small adjustments and by swapping ms with

msms. Applications include the power of various tests to detect
selective sweeps in structured populations, including adaptation
from standing genetic variation and from recurrent mutation (soft
sweeps, Hermisson and Pennings, 2005; Pennings and Hermisson,
2006a, b), the genetic footprint of local adaptation and adaptive gene
ﬂow after population splits. Extensions beyond previous programs
also include the output of joint site—frequency spectra and the
possibility of specifying multiple neutral loci. The performance
of msms is generally comparable to ms (see the manual for a
detailed runtime comparison). Complex population demographies
can therefore be studied with selection added, without imposing
additional computation time limitations. The name msms refers to
the German “‘mach” Stichprobe mit Selektion’ (i.e. make sample
with selection).

2 METHODS

The coalescent (Hudson, 1983; Kingman, 1982) is a stochastic process
to generate genealogies from a population by tracing randomly sampled
alleles backwards in time. Population structure, as well as demography and
recombination, are readily incorporated into a coalescent framework (for
review, Hein et al., 2005; Wakeley, 2008).

To include selection into a simulator based on the coalescent, we extend
the approach of (Kaplan et al., 1989) and (Barton et al., 2004) to the case of
structured populations. Conditioned on the frequency paths of the beneﬁcial
allele in all demes of the metapopulation, ancestral lines of one or several
neutral markers linked to the beneﬁcial allele can be followed backward in
time. The structured coalescent as described by (Kaplan et al., 1989) is thus
structured by both geography and genetic background. It is implemented by
a three—step procedure. (i) The ﬁrst step consists of generating the frequency
paths (trajectories) of the selected allele in all demes by multinomial
sampling in a Wright—Fisher model for an arbitrary geographical structure.
(ii) The second step is the construction of the genealogy at one or several

neutral loci using a structured ancestral recombination graph conditioned on
the frequency paths. (iii) Finally, neutral mutations are added to the branches
of the genealogical tree according to a Poisson process.

Forward simulations: in the current version of the program, the time—forward
simulations to generate the trajectory of the selected allele assume selection
at a single locus with two alleles A and a. Individuals can be haploid 0r
diploid. For diploids, the ﬁtness values for the three genotypes in deme
i are 1+sf’“, 1+sz and 1+sj-4A, respectively. Selection can differ among
demes. Migration from deme j to deme i is deﬁned as the proportion mi]- of
deme i that is made up of migrants from deme j. We let mi,- 2 1 —ijij,
which is the proportion of non—migrants in deme i. Let N,- and n,- be the
population size and the number of A copies in deme i, respectively, and
x,- =n,-/(2N,-) its frequency. The simulator allows for recurrent mutation at
the selected site with rates it from a—>A and 1) from A—>a. All model
parameters (for mutation, selection and migration) can change with time in
a step—wise fashion. The simulator further allows for changes in population
size and in the number of demes (splits and mergers) in analogy to ms.

Consider a single deme i with proportion x,- of the A allele. Selection,
mutation and migration occur according to the deterministic recurrence
equation

 of A copies in the next generation is given by

Simulation runs start with an arbitrary starting frequency x(0) and continue

until some stopping condition (e.g. loss or ﬁxation of the A allele) is met.

Coalescent simulations: simulations with recombination according to the
ancestral recombination graph (ARG) are carried out conditional on the
frequency of the A allele in all demes. In the time before the ﬁrst origin of
A, and after its ﬁxation in all demes (if applicable), the ARG is the standard
neutral one (in a structured population). During the selection phase, events
of different types (coalescence, mutation at the selected locus, migration
and recombination) occur according to a competing Poisson process scheme
with rates that depend on the stochastic trajectory of the selected allele. For
example, coalescence in the A and a background in deme i occurs at rates
proportional to l/xl-(t) and 1/(1—xl-(t)), respectively, and migration of the
selected allele from j to i (forward in time) at a rate proportional to xj(t)/x,-(t).
Rates for other events and all details are given in the documentation
(Supplementary Material).

The coalescent simulations assume continuous time and events are not
linked to discrete generation steps. For high recombination and migration
rates, and for low frequencies of the A allele, the time between consecutive
events can get smaller than a generation time. To reconcile this with the
discrete time—forward simulations, the trajectory of the A allele is treated as
a piecewise constant function with (potential) jumps after every generation.

Validation: the simulation program was validated using ms for complex
neutral genealogies and for selection in a panmictic population using the
simulator by (Pennings and Hermisson, 2006a), which builds on (Kim
and Stephan, 2002). No signiﬁcant deviations were found when comparing
marginal allele frequency spectra or the distribution of Tajima’s D statistic

with a X2 or Kolmogrorov—Smirnov test. Appropriate analytical results have
also been checked and matched.

3 EXAMPLE

To illustrate the capabilities of the program and its performance, we use
the model for human demography with parameters inferred in (Gutenkunst
et al., 2009). Example parameters and the program command line for
this example are included in the manual. Figure 1 shows pairwise spectra
for Europeans and Asians under neutrality and with selection only in the
European population. The initial frequency of the beneﬁcial allele is zero,
adaptation occurs from recurrent mutation at the selected locus. The run times
for 10000 replicates were 142 s and 156 s for the neutral and the selected
case, respectively (using a single core of a 2.2 GHz quad core AMD Opteron
processor). Thus, considering selection does not adversely degrade running
times permitting a wide range of applications.

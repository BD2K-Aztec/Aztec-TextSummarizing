ABSTRACT

Summary: Prions are self-templating protein aggregates that stably
perpetuate distinct biological states and are of keen interest to re-
searchers in both evolutionary and biomedical science. The best
understood prions are from yeast and have a prion-forming domain
with strongly biased amino acid composition, most notably enriched
for Q or N. PLAAC is a web application that scans protein sequences
for domains with prion-like amino acid composition. Users can upload
sequence files, or paste sequences directly into a textbox. PLAAC
ranks the input sequences by several summary scores and allows
scores along sequences to be visualized. Text output files can be
downloaded for further analyses, and visualizations saved in PDF
and PNG formats.

Availability and implementation: http://plaac.wi.mit.edu/. The Ruby-
based web framework and the command-line software (implemented
in Java, with visualization routines in R) are available at http://github.
com/whitehead/plaac under the MIT license. All software can be run
under OS X, Windows and Unix.

1 INTRODUCTION

Prions are proteins that can switch from non-aggregated states to
self-templating highly ordered aggregates. This property allows
them to confer stable changes in biological states that are of great
interest in molecular and evolutionary biology (Newby and
Lindquist, 2013). For example, they create neurodegenerative
diseases, perpetuate activity states in neural synapses and provide
access to a broad realm of phenotypic diversiﬁcation in mi-
crobes. The ability to identify potential prion-like proteins
from sequence data would speed the search for new prions
across a wide variety of taxa. We previously developed (Alberti
et al., 2009) a hidden Markov model (HMM) to identify candi-
date prions and parse these candidates into prion-like domains
(PrLDs) and non-PrLDs, on the basis of amino acid (AA) com-
position. Brieﬂy, the HMM has two hidden states, for PrLD and
background, and the output symbols are the 20 AAs. The output

probabilities for the PrLD state were constructed based on the AA
frequencies in the PrLDs of four prions of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
that were known at the time. This algorithm and extensions have
since been used in several studies to identify prion-like sequences in
yeast (Holmes et al., 2013) and also in humans (Kim et al., 2013;
King et al., 2012), in which several proteins with PrLDs are asso-
ciated with ALS and related neurodegenerative disorders. Here we
describe a web-based front end to the prion-prediction algorithm,
PLAAC, and give an overview of implementation and extensions;
further details are provided on the PLAAC Web site.

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

PLAAC supports the scanning of single protein sequences for
potential PrLDs, as well as the seaming of whole proteomes.
The user can specify a minimum length for prion domains (set
by a textbox, by default Lcore = 60), and can optionally use or-
ganism-speciﬁc background AA frequencies in the HMM instead
of the default S.cerevisiae background frequencies. These fre-
quencies can be computed from the uploaded sequences, or se-
lected from precomputed organism-speciﬁc frequencies (set by a
dropdown list). A parameter or (set via a slider) allows continu-
ous interpolation between organism-speciﬁc background fre-
quencies (or = 0) and S.cerevisiae background frequencies
(or = 1). We have used or = 0.5 when scanning other species, re-
ﬂecting our uncertainty in the degree to which the corresponding
PrLD AA frequencies are skewed toward S. cerevisiae back-
ground frequencies (as opposed to being species-independent).

Resulting output including per-protein summary tables and
per-residue tables for selected proteins can be downloaded as
text ﬁles. Visualizations can also be downloaded as PNG or
PDF ﬁles (Fig. 1). The command-line program allows additional
control over plots [which tracks to display, and whether to show
sliding averages of per-residue scores (Alberti et al., 2009) or
sliding averages of these sliding averages (Kim et al., 2013)].

Single sequence: To search for PrLDs in a single sequence, the
user pastes into a textbox or uploads the protein sequence, either
in F ASTA format or as bare sequence, and may modify the Lcore
and or parameters, if desired. After submission, scores (including
COREscore, LLR and PAPA scores described below) for the
sequence are displayed along with a graphical visualization of
the location, if any, of predicted PrLDs.

Fig. 1. Visualization outputs from PLAAC. Top: four known yeast prion
proteins with each AA color-coded by its enrichment log-likelihood ratio
in PrLDs (styled after the Sequence Enrichment Visualization Tool; http://
jura.wi.mit.edu/cgi—bin/bio/draw_enrichment.pl), with HMM parse indi-
cated by outer bars. Bottom: detailed visualization of the Sup35 protein,
including several prion-prediction scores discussed in the main text

Multiple sequences and whole proteomes: To scan multiple pro-
tein sequences (including whole proteomes), the user again pastes
or uploads them in F ASTA format. (Upload is recommended for
more than a few sequences.) Lcore and a parameters may be
adjusted, and background frequencies may be computed directly
from the provided sequences (not recommended if uploading or
pasting just a few sequences). The user is presented with a sum-
mary table with a row for each uploaded protein ranked by
COREscore from highest to lowest and then may select candi-
dates in this summary list to generate plots for further
visualization.

Output ranking and scores: Multiple sequences are ranked for
prion-like properties by the COREscore metric (Alberti et al.,
2009), which is the maximum sum of per-residue log-likelihood
ratios for any subsequence of length Lcore that falls entirely
within the PrLD state in the HMM Viterbi parse, provided a
sequence of this length exists, and is undeﬁned (NaN) otherwise.
In addition, we compute a score LLR (for log-likelihood ratio)
that is otherwise identical to COREscore, but without the re-
quirement that the sequence falls entirely within the PrLD state
of the HMM parse. Because LLR does not impose a hard cutoff,
it can be useful when doing exploratory whole-proteome ana-
lyses, e.g. on the overall distribution of (near) PrLDs. However,
examining whether the region with the highest LLR score falls
entirely within the PrLD state in the HMM parse may be in-
formative, e. g. when selecting domains to clone for studies of
candidate PrLDs fused to reporter proteins.

Algorithm updates: Since the publication of (Alberti et al.,
2009), the AA frequencies for the PrLD state of the HMM
have been updated based on 28 candidate PrLDs that showed
switching behavior or strong amyloid formation experimentally
(see source code for details). These updated AA frequencies were
used in later publications (Holmes et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013;
King et al., 2012).

A subsequent algorithm called PAPA (Toombs et al., 2010,
2012) that uses AA scores derived from a random mutagenesis
screen can downweigh many of the apparent false positives from
Alberti et al. (2009), and can give sharper predictions for the re-
sults of point mutations (Kim et al., 2013). It appears that a small
number of hydrophobic residues can speed amyloid formation in
regions otherwise highly enriched for polar uncharged residues
such as Q and N (Toombs et al., 2010). PLAAC and PAPA are
complementary, as PLAAC identiﬁes such regions, and PAPA
has been validated only on such regions. (Single scores based on
local averages of per-residue AA scores do not adequately capture
the trade-off between hydrophobic and polar uncharged residues.)
We reimplemented PAPA, and included this score in the output
and visualizations, along with predictions of intrinsically unfolded
protein regions from a reimplementation of F oldIndex (Prilusky
et al., 2005). It is also important to note that there are several
known prions that are not strongly Q/N—rich (e.g. het-S, PrP,
Mod5), but as systematic experimental screening for prion-like
propagation is lacking for non-Q/N—rich proteins, it is difﬁcult
to estimate the false-negative rates of these algorithms.

PLAAC has been developed as a web application to allow
users to scan single protein sequences as well as whole proteomes
for the presence of PrLDs. We have also augmented the original
algorithm with additional scores, making uniﬁed comparisons
possible.

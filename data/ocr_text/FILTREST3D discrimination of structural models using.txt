ABSTRACT

Summary: Automatic methods for macromolecular structure
prediction (fold recognition, de novo folding and docking programs)
produce large sets of alternative models. These large model sets
often include many native-like structures, which are often scored
as false positives. Such native-like models can be more easily
identified based on data from experimental analyses used as
structural restraints (e.g. identification of nearby residues by cross-
linking, chemical modification, site-directed mutagenesis, deuterium
exchange coupled with mass spectrometry, etc.). We present a
simple server for scoring and ranking of models according to their
agreement with user-defined restraints.

Availability: FILTREST3D is freely available for users as a web server

1 INTRODUCTION

Contemporary methods for modeling of macromolecular structures
are generally incapable of producing a single, well-deﬁned,
conﬁdent model and instead generate numerous alternative
conformations (called ‘decoys’ in folding or ‘poses’ in docking).
Benchmarking experiments CASP and CAPRI have demonstrated
that among sets of alternatives there are often models that somewhat
resemble the native structure; however, current algorithms still have
difﬁculty in identifying the correct solution from the list of false
positives without additional data.

It is known that the inclusion of sparse experimental data as spatial
restraints can greatly improve the discrimination of near-native
protein structure models from alternative conformations. Structural
features of proteins are commonly studied using low-resolution
methods. For example, functionally important residues that cluster
together in space (such as the active sites) can be identiﬁed by

mutagenesis. Exposed protein and nucleic acid surfaces or ligand-
binding sites can be discovered by chemical modiﬁcation. The crude
topology of a protein structure can be predicted by intra- or inter-
molecular cross-linking and identiﬁcation of cross-linked peptide
fragments by mass spectroscopy. The shape of the molecule can be
studied by electron microscopy or small angle scattering of X-rays or
neutrons, whereas sparse NMR data can be used to characterize local
conformation of the polypeptide and identify long-range contacts.
These experiments produce data that are more ambiguous, fuzzy
and of much lower resolution than X-ray crystallography or fully
assigned NMR. Thus, they cannot be used alone to solve the
structure of a protein or a macromolecular complex. However, a
combination of experimental results with bioinformatics methods
signiﬁcantly improves the probability of ﬁnding a correct global
fold and architecture of functionally important regions (Potluri et al.,
2004; Ye et al., 2004).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

FILTREST3D is a standalone open source Python program and
a freely available web server (http://ﬁltrest3d.genesilico.pl/) for
scoring and ranking of models according to consistency with
user-deﬁned restraints (derived from experiments or computational
predictions). The FILTEST3D scoring function is a simple sum
of Violations, expressed in real values (e.g. distance below the
given threshold and solvation above a given threshold) multiplied
by the weights. Weights can be assigned by the users depending
on the conﬁdence and/or accuracy of different restraints. As
heterogenous experimental datasets often contain various errors,
FILTREST3D allows for ranking of models based on mutually
inconsistent restraints. Different restraints can also be connected
with the logical operators ‘and’/ ‘or’. Discrimination with sparse
or weak restraints may result in assigning good scores to many
different models, which may suggest that more data should be used
to allow for sharp discrimination. Alternatively, if all decoys Violate
the restraints, the user may consider it as a suggestion to perform
additional modeling. Obviously, the interpretation of the results is
the responsibility of the user.

FILTREST3D distinguishes alternative models of individual
protein and nucleic acid molecules as well as protein—protein,
protein—nucleic acid and protein—ligand complexes. The available
restraint types include distance, solvation, local and global

secondary structure composition and existence of knots in protein
structure. Distance restraints limit permitted range of distances
between the residues (e.g. ‘5 A between any atom of residue X
and residue Y’ or ‘5—10A between the C-oc residue X in chain
A and any residue of the fragment Y—Z in chain B’) or sets of
residues (e. g. between B-sheetA171-C182 of chain A, and an oc—helix
A57—D62 of chain B). Amino acid burial/exposition to the solvent
may be given as a range of relative solvent accessibility (ASA)
expressed in percentages. Local secondary structure can be speciﬁed
for a given range of residues (e.g. ‘there is an oc—helix spanning
residues 151—162’). Global secondary structure composition (e.g.
from circular dichroism experiments) may be given as a percentage
of helical and extended residues. Topological knots are rare in native
structures but may occur in misfolded models; therefore, we also
implemented a procedure for knot detection (Taylor, 2000). In case
of mutually exclusive restraints, FILTREST3D allows different sets
of mutually exclusive restraints to be applied with an ‘OR’ operator
that returns the smallest penalty from all alternatives.

FILTREST3D generates an output ﬁle with the ranking and
information about all restraints as well as a script to Visualize the
restraints on the model with PyMol (http://www.pymol.org). The
web server automatically compares and clusters the best models,
so that the user may easily discover any patterns that may emerge
among multiple models that satisfy the restraints.

We tested FILTREST3D on various sets of alternative structures
generated by modeling and/0r docking, and tested by restraints
from a variety of experimental methods. Published examples of our
analyses include reinterpretation of the crystal structure of MutL
C—terminal domain and identiﬁcation of a correct dimer structure
(Kosinski et al., 2005) as well as de novo generation of a docking
complex between tRNA and two domains of methyltransferase
PAB1283 (Gabant et al., 2006). We have also benchmarked
FILTREST3D on a set of 10 CAPRI targets (Supplementary Data);
our method was able to identify 657 (97%) of 678 models assessed
as of high or medium quality according to CAPRI criteria.

Here, we present a practical example to discriminate between
decoys obtained by low-resolution docking with GRAMM (Vakser,
1995) of a TruA enzyme structure (PDB code 1VS3, apo form) to
its tRNA substrate (PDB code 2VOG, a complex with an unrelated
protein). As a reference, we used the native structure of this complex
(PBD code 2NRO). We produced 30 000 decoys with the grid
step: 3.5 A, and repulsion parameter 20. None of these decoys
could be identiﬁed as native-like by the published potential for
scoring protein—RNA interactions (Zheng et al., 2007), and the top-
scored three decoys exhibited root mean square deviation to the
native structure of >40 A (data not shown). For discrimination of
native—like complexes with FILTREST3D, we used ﬁve distance
restraints. TruA residues R50 and N52 are known to be involved in
the catalysis of isomerization of U39 in tRNA (two speciﬁc amino
acid—nucleotide restraints) and R23, H119 and R162 are involved
in RNA binding (three general restraints for interactions with any
nucleotide of the whole tRNA molecule). All restraints were used
with the same weights (default values). The ﬁltering took 8 h with the
standalone version of the program running on a Linux workstation
with the 3.06 GHz Intel Xeon processor. Only two decoys satisﬁed
all restraints. They were similar to each other and exhibited a native-
like orientation of the tRNA with respect to the protein, despite
relatively high RMSD to the native structure (22.36 and 26.56 A;
see the FILTREST3D web site for details and images). Based on

this example and on our previously published analyses, we conclude
that FILTREST3D allows for identiﬁcation of biologically relevant
models among decoys generated by low-resolution docking, even in
situations where the decoys are too far from the native structure to
be discriminated by other means, such as the use of potentials for
protein—RNA interactions.

In principle, the same analysis can be carried out Via the web
server version of the program. However, the web server has a limited
capacity for handling large ﬁles. Hence, the input should be split
into several independent ﬁles of no more than 1GB. Besides, the
successful submission of large ﬁles is dependent on the network
connection, therefore, we strongly recommend using the standalone
version of FILTREST3D for scoring large sets of decoys (>1000
structures or ﬁle size >100 MB).

There exist other specialized tools for restraint-driven modeling or
docking, such as MODELLER (Sali and Blundell, 1993), Haddock
(Dominguez et al., 2003), RAPPER (Fumham et al., 2006) or IMP
(Alber et al., 2007). FILTREST is not a modeling tool, but a more
universal model scoring tool: it can analyze all types of models,
including decoys from de novo folding, nucleic acids, etc. Further,
to our best knowledge, FILTREST3D is the only online service that
allows scoring of models based on combination of distance restraints
with other factors such as local or global structure or molecule shape,
and that implements logical operators to enable sets of alternative
restraints.

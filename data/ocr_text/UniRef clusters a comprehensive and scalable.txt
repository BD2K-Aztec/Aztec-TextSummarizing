Abstract

Motivation: UniRef databases provide full—scale clustering of UniProtKB sequences and are utilized
for a broad range of applications, particularly similarity—based functional annotation. Non—redun—
dancy and intra—cluster homogeneity in UniRef were recently improved by adding a sequence
length overlap threshold. Our hypothesis is that these improvements would enhance the speed
and sensitivity of similarity searches and improve the consistency of annotation within clusters.
Results: Intra—cluster molecular function consistency was examined by analysis of Gene Ontology
terms. Results show that UniRef clusters bring together proteins of identical molecular function in
more than 97% of the clusters, implying that clusters are useful for annotation and can also be
used to detect annotation inconsistencies. To examine coverage in similarity results, BLASTP
searches against UniRef50 followed by expansion of the hit lists with cluster members demon—
strated advantages compared with searches against UniProtKB sequences; the searches are con—
cise (N7 times shorter hit list before expansion), faster (N6 times) and more sensitive in detection
of remote similarities (>96% recall at e—value <0.0001). Our results support the use of UniRef clus—
ters as a comprehensive and scalable alternative to native sequence databases for similarity
searches and reinforces its reliability for use in functional annotation.

summary cluster and membership information, including the
sequence of a representative (best—annotated) protein, member count
and common taxonomy of the cluster, the accession numbers of all
the merged entries and links to rich functional annotation in
UniProtKB to facilitate biological discovery.

The UniRef databases have been produced for 10 years and are
used worldwide for a broad range of applications. Since first
released in 2004, UniRef has been cited over 400 times based on
Google Scholar and unique citations from PubMed Central.
UniRef’s ability to reduce redundancy while preserving information
on source and quality annotation has proven useful in many studies
based on the citation analysis. The most common uses of UniRef
databases continue to be in functional annotation, family classifica-
tion, systems biology, structural genomics, phylogenetic analysis
and mass spectrometry. Recent studies have also used UniRef for im-
proving protein sequence alignments through homology extension
(Chang et 61]., 2012), increasing sequence search sensitivity with
transitive alignments (Malde and Furmanek, 2013), developing rep—
resentative proteomes and proteome clusters (Chen et 61]., 2011),
predicting the functional effects of disease variants (Capriotti and
Altman, 2011a, b; Sim et 61]., 2012), performing functional screening
of metagenomics data (Foerstner et 61]., 2008; Wommack et 61].,
2012), developing large—scale hierarchical clustering algorithms
(Loewenstein et 61]., 2008), studying gene duplication (Rivera et 61].,
2010) and conducting genomic studies of peptide and oligonucleo—
tide frequencies (Capone et 61]., 2010). Based on the UniProt usage
statistics, UniRef web pages receive approximately 200 000 hits per
month. The UniRef file download has been increasing steadily since
its inception with an annual growth rate of 20% in recent years,
now reaching more than 3000 annual unique IP downloads.

In this article, we present analysis of two additional qualities of
UniRef databases: That clusters bring together proteins with similar
to identical functional annotation and that similarity searches are
faster and as sensitive as searches on native sequence databases. We
also provide an update on UniRef database production and
coverage.

2 System and methods
2.1 UniRef database production

The UniRef databases have been produced as a component of
UniProt (2013) since its first release in January 5, 2004 and updated
with each release of UniProtKB. Production details were previously
described (Suzek et 61]., 2007). Briefly, the databases are generated in
a hierarchical fashion; UniRef100 clusters are generated first using
sequences from UniProtKB and UniParc, UniRef90 clusters are
then generated using UniRef100 clusters and UniRef50 clusters
are generated using UniRef90 clusters. The clusters are computed
using a parallelized version of the CD—HIT algorithm (Li et 61].,
2001; Li and Godzik, 2006). Using a full update procedure, the clus—
ters are computed ab initio at the end of year and are updated for
the remaining year using an incremental procedure that favors
clustering of new sequences under existing clusters. The representa—
tives of clusters are selected based on the level of curation (reviewed
versus unreviewed), protein name (e.g. names do not contain hypo—
thetical or putative preferred), source organism (e.g. proteins from
model organisms preferred) and length of protein. The UniRef iden-
tifiers are derived from the cluster ‘representatives’ identifiers and
are preserved for approximately 98% of the clusters between
releases. UniRef production has been continuously enhanced to
improve the quality and information content of the databases, as

well as the efficiency of cluster computation to cope with explosive
growth in sequences being reported.

Starting in January, 2013 an 80% sequence length overlap
threshold was introduced for the computation of UniRef90 and
UniRef50 databases, that is each member of a given UniRef90
and UniRef50 cluster will have a minimum length overlap of 80%
with the longest (seed) sequence. Computed in this manner UniRef
is conceptually similar to the PIRSF ‘homeomorphic’ family classifi-
cation (Wu et 61]., 2004). This overlap threshold prevents proteins
sharing only partial sequences from being clustered together. For
example, polyproteins and their component proteins, or clusters of
domain families partially sharing domain architecture. The thresh—
old also improves intra—cluster molecular function consistency.
UniRef100 is computed without the overlap threshold in order to
remove sequence redundancy resulting from subfragments. The par-
allel cluster computation algorithm (Suzek et 61]., 2007) has been
revised to accommodate the new overlap threshold.

2.2 Characterization of UniRef clusters

To characterize functional properties of UniRef clusters, we assess
the intra—cluster molecular function consistency by using Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et 61]., 2000) molecular function annota—
tions of cluster members in UniProtKB. The consistency between
these GO term assignments can be at different levels ranging from
all members sharing identical GO terms to members with unrelated
GO terms that can only be traced back to the ROOT term in GO
hierarchy (i.e. GO:0003674 molecular function). In defining the
levels of consistency, we used the GO term specificity (P) metric
computed based on a term’s hierarchical level:

P 2 1 Number of Offspring

 

— Number of Offspring —I— Number of Ancestors
(Louie et al., 2010)

where a GO term is more specific (has a larger specificity metric) if
the number of ancestors is greater than the number of descendants.
The P : 1.0 means a GO term has no descendants (the most
specific) and P = 0.0 means the ROOT term (i.e. GO:0003674 mo—
lecular function) that has no ancestors (the least specific).
Accordingly, we categorized UniRef clusters based on their intra—
cluster consistency at four levels as shown and described in Figure 1.

2.3 UniRef databases for sequence similarity searches
Sequence similarity searches against UniRef database leverage its
strength in removing sequencing bias and redundancy, while taking
advantage of its power of clustering proteins of similar function (see
Section 3.3). Users can avoid compiling and comparing hundreds of
BLAST (Altschul et 61]., 1990) result pages containing highly similar, if
not identical, sequences. Similarity searches against protein sequence
clusters have been shown to be equally sensitive but return faster re—
sults (Park et 61]., 2000; Li et 61]., 2002; Itoh et 61]., 2004; Cameron
et 61]., 2007) when compared against native sequence databases of
sizes ranging from approximately 400 000 to 2.6 million sequences—
several fold smaller than current sequence set used to compute UniRef
databases. We tested the effectiveness and performance of UniRef50
for sequence similarity searches as an ever—expanding and continu—
ously updated database available to scientific community.

To do this, we compared results from two full-scale BLASTP
searches using UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot query sequences against two
separate target databases. UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot is a query set that
contains sequences of different length, taxonomy and composition.

Fig. 1. The categories of UniRef clusters based on intra-cluster functional
consistency. Upper left panel shows an example of GO term hierarchy used.
Other panels illustrate the UniRef clusters in categories based on their intra-
cluster consistency; | (All members have identical GO terms), "-1 (all mem-
bers share common GO terms and some have additional less or equally
specific GO terms, not children of the shared GO terms), "-2 (all members
share common GO terms and some have additional more specific GO terms),
I” (only some members share common GO terms but all member’s GO terms
can be traced to a common non-root parent GO term, is a child of one of the
shared GO terms) and IV (members do not have any common GO term and
the existing ones cannot be traced to a common non-root parent GO term)

The first BLASTP search used the UniRef50 cluster seed sequences
as a target database and the search results were expanded using the
members of the corresponding UniRef50 clusters upon completion
of the run (referred to as ‘UniRef50—based searches’). The expanded
results included all the subfragments computed at UniRef100
level. The second BLASTP search used all of the UniProtKB
sequences as a target database (referred to as ‘UniProtKB—based
searches’). In either BLASTP search, the same effective database size
(computed based on target consisting of UniProtKB sequences),
e—value threshold (10) and a large hit list size (10 million) are used
as parameters.

The UniRef50—based and UniProtKB—based searches are com—
pared using precision and recall, defined as:

, , True Positive
Prec1s1on=

 

True Positive —1— False Negative

_ Numbers of hits common to UniProtKB and UniRef5 0—based searches
_ Numbers of hits in expanded UniRef5 0—based search

 

True Positive (2)
Recall :

 

True Positive —1— False Negative

_ Numbers of hits common to UniProtKB and UniRef50—based searches
_ Numbers of hits in UniProtKB-based search

 

(3)

where ‘hits in expanded UniRef—50—based search’ consist of all
underlying cluster members. These metrics assume the UniProtKB—
based searches result in all true hits.

Malde and Furmanek (2013) showed that using UniRef50 as an
intermediate database can increase sequence search sensitivity when
compared with directly searching the target database. In our study,
to compare the ability of UniRef50—based and UniProtKB—based
searches to detect distant similarity by BLASTP, we constructed an
evaluation dataset based on a different criterion. Pfam domains are
detected by curated hidden Markov models, a sensitive means to
detect distant similarities that can be expected to find even remotely
similar domains. Our dataset contained query—target pairs of

UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot Human (query) and UniProtKB (target) pro—
tein sequences where query and target share at least one Pfam
(Punta et al., 2012) domain spanning more than 80% of the target
protein. Figure 2 shows an example for targets UniProtKB:A75 004
and UniProtKBzQ81288 that are paired with UniProtKB:P40123
using two domains Pfam:PF01213 and Pfam:PF08603. From a total
of 20 247 UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot human sequences, 15 537 paired
with at least one target protein meeting our criteria, resulting in 43
523 748 query—target pairs. We also used all InterPro (Hunter et al.,
2012) domains to construct an alternative evaluation dataset with
the same query set and criteria. This dataset contained 831 524 768
pairs for 18 049 queries.

We then counted how many of these query—target pairs are
detected by each search. For each human query sequence, we com—
puted the percent difference in related sequences detected by
UniRef50—based searches (expanded to all cluster members) versus
UniProtKB—based searches. In essence, we try to identify distant sim—
ilarities missed by UniProtKB— or UniRef50—based searches that are
typically identified through domain families.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Database coverage, size reduction and cluster
distribution

UniRef release 2014_08 (September 3, 2014) was computed from
96 055 068 sequences, including all UniProtKB sequences and iso—
forms (82 710 662) plus selected UniParc sequences (13 344 406)
that were not represented in UniProtKB. It consists of 44 408 603
(UniRef100), 25 890 643 (UniRef90) and 11 862 245 (UniRef50)
clusters, with a database size reduction of 54%, 73% and 88%,
respectively. Although the sequence space has expanded over
80—fold since the first release in 2004, the parallel CD-HIT cluster-
ing algorithm modified for UniRef (Suzek et al., 2007) has proven to
be effective in coping with sequence growth. Furthermore, the intro-
duction of the 80% sequence length overlap threshold to the compu—
tation of UniRef90 and UniRef50 reduced the compute time more
than 5 -fold, further improving the scalability of UniRef. Note that
the new overlap threshold has little effect on UniRef50 cluster topol—
ogies, since it results in less than 5% increase in number of clusters
and less than 2% change of representative sequences.

The number of protein sequences in UniProtKB continues to rise
at an accelerated pace (Fig. 3). Comparing the growth of UniRef
with UniProtKB shows a correspondingly improved relative reduc—
tion in database size by UniRef, particularly apparent in the last 3
years. The relative reduction in database size went from 5 %/42%/
70% in 2004 to 54%/73%/88% in 2014 for UniRef100, UniRef90
and UniRef50, respectively, illustrating the effectiveness of UniRef
in minimizing sequence redundancy.

The size distribution of UniRef clusters continues to follow a
logarithmic curve (Fig. 4), consistent with the power law distribu—
tions observed in a variety of bioinformatics measures (Luscombe
et al., 2002; Kunin et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2005). Single—member
clusters constitute a majority of UniRef clusters at all levels; 67% of
UniRef50 clusters, 78% of UniRef90 clusters and 89% of
UniRef100 clusters have only one member. The largest UniRef100
cluster in the current release 2014_01 contains 9215 highly con-
served ‘Histone H3.2’ proteins from eukaryotes, the largest
UniRef90 cluster contains 43 060 ‘Ribulose bisphosphate carboxyl—
ase large chain’ proteins mainly from eukaryotes and a few
unknown organisms (environmental samples), and the largest
UniRef50 cluster contains 76 446 ‘Cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1’
proteins from eukaryotes.

3.2 Preservation of GO molecular function in UniRef
clusters

The evaluation of UniRef clusters and the evaluation of UniRef50—
based sequence similarity search (Section 3.3) was conducted using
UniRef release 2013_02 (February 6, 2013) following the introduc—
tion of the 80% overlap threshold. We used GO molecular function
terms for consistency analysis as described in Section 2.2. Only clus—
ters with at least two UniProtKB members annotated with GO
molecular function terms, regardless of their evidence codes, were
included in the analysis. 1 449 352 UniRef90 clusters and 888 751
UniRef50 clusters met the criteria, account for 50.32% and 41.28%
of the multi-member UniRef90 and UniRef50 clusters, respectively.
Clusters used in the analysis were categorized based on intra—cluster
consistency into four levels (Table 1).

Categories I and II, which represent clusters bringing together pro-
teins of identical and common function, account for 98.83%
of UniRef90 and 97.01% of UniRef50 clusters analyzed. In
the analyzed set only 0.22% of UniRef90 and 0.62% of UniRef50 clus—
ters were considered inconsistent (Category IV), by the criterion that the
lowest shared parent annotated GO term was the ROOT node.

We computed the specificity of a UniRef cluster as the maximum
specificity P (Equation (1)) for all GO molecular function terms
from cluster’s members. Figure 5 shows the distribution of
UniRef90 clusters’ specificities where 92% of clusters with specifi—
city 1.0 belong to Categories I and II—1. The common GO terms for
these clusters at specificity 1.0 also reach P: 1.0. This shows the
clusters’ members are consistent on their most specific GO term
assignments. At lower cluster specificity levels, Category I still
constitutes the majority. Categories III and IV are too small to be
compared meaningfully. UniRef50 clusters’ have a category distribu—
tion similar to UniRef90.

A more detailed analysis of individual clusters in different cate—
gories reveals different functional properties of these categories.

Category I clusters constitute the ideal where all members of a clus—
ter are consistently annotated with the same GO terms. For example
in release 2013_02, all members of the cluster UniRef90_G1UIH8
are annotated with the same GO terms: ‘GO:0003824 catalytic ac—
tivity,’ ‘GO:0030170 pyridoxal phosphate binding,’ ‘GO:0008483
transaminase activity’ and ‘GO:0016740 transferase activity.’
The exhibited GO term consistency in annotations, supported with
sequence similarity and overlap, could be used to make cluster level
GO term assignments.

thresholds

Category II—1 clusters consist of members annotated with com—
mon GO terms and additional GO terms that are no more specific,
many of which are parents of common ones. For example in release
2013_02, all the members (when fragments are excluded from
UniRef100) of the cluster UniRef50_Q9P225 are annotated with
the same GO terms; ‘GO:0005524 ATP binding’, ‘GO:0017111 nu-
cleoside—triphosphatase activity’, ‘GO:0016887 ATPase activity’,
‘GO:0000166 nucleotide binding’ and ‘GO:0003777 microtubule
motor activity’. However, only some members of this cluster such
as UniProtKB entries POC6F1 and Q9P225 are also annotated with
‘GO:0003774 motor activity’ that is a parent to ‘GO:0003777
microtubule motor activity’. Such annotation discrepancies are
generally corrected in UniProtKB updates. In the case of
UniRef50_Q9P225, starting release 2013_10, the members no
longer list ‘GO:0003774 motor activity’.

The cases of Category II—2 could be indicative of missing or
less specific (under—annotated) GO terms. For example in release
2013_02, cluster UniRef50_I8GP88 consists of ‘D—alanine—poly
(phosphoribitol) ligase, subunit 1’ proteins from several
Mycobacterium species. All of these proteins are annotated with
the corresponding GO term ‘GO:0047473 D—alanine—poly(phos—
phoribitol) ligase activity’ with the exception of
UniProtKB:B1MLB4. This UniProtKB entry is annotated only
with the term ‘GO:0003824 catalytic activity’ even if it has the
identical sequence (sharing the same UniRef100) with other mem-
bers of the UniRef5 0_18GP88.

Considering GO molecular function annotations in UniProtKB
are predominantly assigned using sequence similarity—based methods
(e.g. InterPro), we also tested whether our results are biased by a
data circularity problem and replicated our consistency analysis on
UniRef clusters containing members from 12 model organisms with
comprehensive and reliable GO annotation: nine are part of the GO
Reference set (Reference Genome Group of the Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2009), including Arabidopsis thalicma, Caenorhabditis
elegans, Danio rerio, Drosopbila melanogaster, Callus, Homo sapi-
ens, Mus musculus, Rattus norvegicus and Saccharomyces cerez/i-
side; the remaining three are Bos Taurus, Cam's familiaris and 5145
scrofa. 55 231 UniRef90 clusters and 44 281 UniRef50 clusters met
the criteria. Similar to the analysis on all clusters, in this analysis
Categories I and II account for 97.41% of UniRef90 and 94.94% of
UniRef50 clusters analyzed. The distribution of clusters at different
levels of specificities shared the similar pattern with the analysis con—
ducted using all clusters.

3.3 Speed and sensitivity of UniRef50—based sequence
similarity searches

To evaluate the speed and sensitivity of UniRef—based sequence simi—
larity searches we compared BLASTP searches using 539 165

UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot entries as query sequences against two target
databases—UniRef50 (totaling 6 551 126 seed sequences for all
UniRef50 clusters) and UniProtKB (totaling 30 309 136 source se—
quences used to compute UniRef)—using the same effective data—
base size and identical parameter settings.

For an e—value threshold of 10, UniProtKB—based searches
returned at least one hit for 535 852 query sequences. Using these
results as the ‘gold standard,’ only 183 of them (0.03% of query
sequences) do not return any hits in UniRef50—based searches.
Among these negative results, 139 are sperm protamine proteins
with long stretches of repeating residues (e.g. UniProtKB:P04553),
and the remaining are short peptides (<40 residues, e.g.
UniProtKB:P84925) or contain repeat or compositionally biased
regions (e.g. UniProtKB entries P04368 or P86797) that adversely
affect BLASTP searches. On the other hand, 1295 query sequences
returned hits on UniRef50—based searches, but not UniProtKB—based
searches, all of which are short peptides (<40 residues, e.g.
UniProtKB:P83010) except an uncharacterized protein with a poly—
asparagine repeat region (UniProtKBzQ54B23).

The average hit list for UniProtKB—based searches is approxi—
mately 10 100 entries, while for UniRef50—based searches it is only
approximately 1400 entries. When presented in tabular format, the
full-scale BLASTP results from UniProtKB—based searches occupy
about eight times more space than UniRef50—based searches
(450GB versus 38GB). The total computation time is directly pro—
portional to the size of the target database, accordingly UniProtKB-
based searches took about 6>< more time than UniRef50—based
searches (on a 121 core Intel Xeon 2.80GHz Linux cluster). The
precision and recall of UniRef50—based searches, defined assuming
all UniProtKB—based search results as correct (Equations (2) and
(3)), are shown in Figure 6. The results were evaluated at different
e—value thresholds ranging 10 to 10e—10 using expanded
UniRef50—based BLASTP hits covering all underlying cluster mem-
bers. The best results plateaued at e—value <0.0001, achieving a
precision of more than 91% and a recall of more than 96%,
respectively.

To determine how the use of UniRef affects sensitivity in
sequence searches, the ability of UniRef50—based searches to detect
distant similarity was evaluated using a dataset of query—target pairs
constructed using Pfam domains (see Section 2.3). From the total of
43 523 748 query—target pairs, UniRef50—based searches detected a
total of 24 602 566 (56.53%) target sequences, whereas UniProtKB—
based searches detected 22 955 75 3(52.74%) targets. Figure 7 illus—
trates the percentage difference in distant similarities detected by
UniRef50—based versus UniProtKB—based searches for 15 537 query
sequences where the search detected at least one target with a Pfam
domain meeting the 80% overlap criterion. UniRef50—based
searches improved detection of distant similarities in 72.50% of the
cases at various levels (>0—25 0%), with a large improvement
(>100% increase) in 9.17% of the cases and a moderate improve—
ment (50—100% increase) in 6.98% of cases. On the other hand, in
6.71% of cases (total of 1042), UniProtKB—based searches detected
more distant similarities. The InterPro—based analysis has a similar
distribution for the percentage differences in detected distant simi—
larities (not shown).

We further examined multiple cases where UniRef50—based
searches out—performed or under—performed in comparison with
UniProtKB—based searches. Many of the UniRef50 outperforming cases
involved clusters where the seed sequence was significantly longer than
some of other member sequences. This can happen because there is no
overlap restriction on UniRef100 allowing identical and fragment
sequences to cluster. For extreme cases where BLASTP queries on

Percentage Change in Distant Similarities Detestecl

Fig. 7. The percentage difference in distant similarities detected by UniRef50-
versus UniProtKB-based searches based on the dataset constructed using
Pfam domains

UniRef50 found more than 250% more similar proteins than queries
on UniProtKB, the majority of the additional sequences found were all
marked as fragment sequences. One example in this group is the
UniRef50—based search using a 273—aa long query protein ‘Voltage—
gated hydrogen channels 1 protein’ (UniProtKB:Q96D96) containing
an ‘Ion transport protein’ (Pfam:PF005 20), which resulted in the largest
percentage increase in detected similarities when compared with
UniProtKB—based searches. In this case, the UniProtKB—based search
detected only one protein (UniProtKB:C3Z7Z7), a 78—aa fragment
sequence, whereas UniRef50—based search detected an additional
217—related proteins from 19 UniRef50 clusters. Among these UniRef
clusters, all of their seed sequences were longer than the 273—aa query
sequence, ranging from 417—aa to 2745—aa, with 16 seeds being more
than 1000—aa and containing multiple copies of the PF00520 domain.
In this case all the additional 217 proteins found using UniRef were
marked as fragment sequences in UniProtKB ranging in size from
18—aa to 225—aa.

An example where UniRef detected many more remotely similar
non-fragment proteins is a query using ‘RNA demethylase
ALKBH5’ (UniProtKB:Q6P6C2), a 394—aa human protein involved
in RNA demethylation affecting mRNA processing and export and
required for spermatogenesis. Q6P6C2 contains a ZOG—Fe(II) oxy—
genase domain (Pfam:PF135 32). The test set contained 2057
query—target pairs. BLASTP against UniProtKB detected only 11
pairs while BLASTP with expansion against UniRef50 detected 821
including all 11 detected using UniProtKB. Only 13 of the additional
810 pairs detected using UniRef50 were marked as fragments. The
additional sequences detected by UniRef50 were found in clusters
UniRef50_K6KEE3 with 3 members and UniRef50_P05050 with
2312 members. Although BLASTP against UniProtKB did detect a
few of the members of UniRef50_P05050 including the seed
sequence A6SZ37, it did not detect most of the remotely similar
Pfam:PF135 32 containing ‘Alpha—ketoglutarate—dependent dioxyge—
nase AlkB’ bacterial proteins involved in DNA repair making up the
majority of sequences in this cluster. Alignment of 154 cluster mem-
bers, 1 for each species contained and ranging in length from 127 to
266 aa, with Clustal Omega (Sievers et al., 2011) showed good
alignment throughout the length of the sequences with 28 identical
and 27 similar positions distributed throughout the alignment with
9.69% overall identity (data not shown).

In cases where UniProtKB searches out—performed UniRef50, many
of the missing proteins had a low degree of similarity to the query and
were contained in clusters where the seed sequence was not detected
by BLASTP using UniProtKB or UniRef50, effectively masking
them from detection. In one example using a 304—aa Human ‘DTW

domain-containing protein 1’ (UniProtKBzQ8N5 C7) of unknown func—
tion containing a DTW domain (Pfam:PF03942, unknown function) as
query, we obtained 1589 possible query—target pairs. BLASTP against
UniProtKB found 285 of these and against UniRef50 with expansion
found 208. There were 102 pairs unique to the UniProtKB results and
8 unique to UniRef50. All of the 102 proteins unique to UniProtKB
were 200—aa ‘DTW domain proteins’ from different strains of Vibrio
cholera and shared a single cluster UniRef50_A7K659 with 270
member sequences. The seed sequence (A7K659) was not detected
by BLASTP (<14% sequence identity with Q8N5C7), but 102
slightly more similar cluster members (e.g. D7HA32) were detected
using UniProtKB that were hidden when using UniRef50. The eight
sequences unique to the UniRef50 search were from four UniRef50
clusters containing members from multiple bacterial species and vary—
ing in length from 150 to 208 aa.

We also compared UniRef50— and UniProtKB—based searches
using ROC50 score (Gribskov and Robinson, 1996), which is the
area under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve up to
the first 50 false positives. As shown in Figure 8, the ROC50 scores
for UniRef50—based searches are higher in general when compared
with corresponding UniProtKB—based ones (73.4% above diagonal)
signifying better sensitivity and specificity.

4 Conclusions

In this article, we provide a detailed analysis of intra—cluster molecu—
lar function consistency, and assess the suitability of UniRef
databases as the target databases in making functional annotation,
taking advantage of their low sequence redundancy and bias,
especially in the case of UniRef50.

More than 97% of the UniRef90 and UniRef50 clusters were
shown to bring together proteins of identical or common molecular
function (as captured by GO terms). This outcome reflects the fact
that many GO terms are assigned on the basis of sequence similar—
ity—based methods such as InterPro, and further reinforces their use
in sequence similarity—based functional annotations. The strong
intra—cluster molecular function consistency lends itself to develop—
ment of new UniRef features such as cluster—level GO annotations
whereas the annotation inconsistencies observed in approximately
3% of the clusters is an indicative for a potential use of UniRef data—
bases in detection of annotation errors.

UniRef50—based BLASTP searches are faster (N6 times), more
concise (lists 7 times shorter), and overall more sensitive in detection
of remote similarities, while close to complete recall (>96% at e—value
<0.0001) when compared with UniProtKB—based searches. The hit
list consisting of the UniRef50 seed sequences not only reduces the
redundancy, but also provides access to information from the
corresponding UniRef50 clusters, such as the GO annotations
from individual members. In addition, the hit lists when
expanded using corresponding UniRef50 cluster members provide an
effective way to locate the similar sequences that are already
identified by UniRef50 and detect more remote similarities for the
query sequence. UniRef50—based searches when compared with
UniProtKB—based searches provide the means necessary to identify
more easily a shorter list of clusters representing similar proteins from
diverse taxa.

In conclusion, our analysis supports the efficiency of using
UniRef databases as a powerful alternative to native sequence data—
bases for similarity searches and in using those searches in functional
annotation. Our analysis also revealed new uses for UniRef cluster
such as correction of GO term annotations through detection of the
intra—cluster molecular function incoherencies. UniRef clusters for
any UniProtKB entry can be viewed under the ‘similar protein’
section of every entry on the UniProt website.

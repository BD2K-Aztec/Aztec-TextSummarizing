ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most biological processes are mediated by the protein—
protein interactions. Determination of the protein—protein structures
and insight into their interactions are vital to understand the mechan-
isms of protein functions. Currently, compared with the isolated pro-
tein structures, only a small fraction of protein—protein structures are
experimentally solved. Therefore, the computational docking methods
play an increasing role in predicting the structures and interactions of
protein—protein complexes. The scoring function of protein—protein
interactions is the key responsible for the accuracy of the computa-
tional docking. Previous scoring functions were mostly developed by
optimizing the binding affinity which determines the stability of the
protein—protein complex, but they are often lack of the consideration
of speciﬁcity which determines the discrimination of native protein—
protein complex against competitive ones.

Results: We developed a scoring function (named as SPA-PP, spe-
cificity and affinity of the protein—protein interactions) by incorporating
both the specificity and affinity into the optimization strategy. The
testing results and comparisons with other scoring functions show
that SPA-PP performs remarkably on both predictions of binding
pose and binding affinity. Thus, SPA-PP is a promising quantification
of protein—protein interactions, which can be implemented into the
protein docking tools and applied for the predictions of protein—protein
structure and affinity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins often function only when they are assembled into
complexes (Sali et al., 2003). The formation of highly efﬁcient
and speciﬁc protein complexes, particularly protein—protein com-
plexes, is a fundamental process in the cell. The structures of the
protein—protein complexes are the principal components of a
systems-level description of genome-wide protein networks,

which rely on the coordinated and tightly regulated activities
of interacting proteins (Kim et al., 2006). The protein—protein
interactions play a key role in various mechanisms of protein
functions (Jones and Thornton, 1996; Ortuso et al., 2006) and
become attractive targets for therapeutic intervention (Loregian
and Palu, 2005). Thus, determination of the protein—protein
structures and insights into their interactions are increasingly
important in the post-genomic era.

Although the individual protein structures are increasingly
well determined, protein assemblies are still poorly represented
in the Protein Data Bank (Chiu et al., 2006; Dutta and Berman,
2005; Steven and Baumeister, 2008). This is because the experi-
mental determination of assembly compositions and structures
generally requires the combination of a number of the experi-
mental techniques and theoretical approaches to maximize com-
pleteness, accuracy and resolution (Sali et al., 2003). As an
alternative, computational docking approaches provide a prac-
tical mean to predict the structures of multi-protein assemblies
starting from the individual components (Janin, 2002).
Computational docking procedure usually incorporates two
steps (Halperin et al., 2002), initial sampling of the conﬁgur-
ational space of the interacting proteins to generate docking
poses and pose scoring to select the putative native (or near-
native) protein—protein conformations. Comparative assessment
of the current protein—protein docking and scoring approaches
shows that efﬁcient sampling strategies may generate the library
of poses, including the native or near-native poses. However, the
scoring function often fails to discriminate the native or near-
native poses against other non-native poses and can not always
produce reliable estimation of the binding afﬁnity of the complex
(Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010; Lensink et al., 2007; Lensink and
Wodak, 2010), suggesting there is substantial room for the im-
provement of the scoring functions.

The development strategies of previous scoring functions for
protein—protein docking (Moreira et al., 2010), whether physics-
based, empirical or knowledge-based, mainly focus on the
prediction of binding afﬁnity (or free energy), which determines
the stability of the complex. However, high afﬁnity does not
guarantee high speciﬁcity, which is controlled by either partner
binding to other proteins discriminativer (Bolon et al., 2005;
Grigoryan et al., 2009; Havranek et al., 2003; Janin, 1995;
Kortemme et al., 2004; Shifman and Mayo, 2003). The develop-
ment strategies of previous scoring functions are often lack of the

considerations of the speciﬁcity, which is the discrimination
of the speciﬁc native protein—protein complex against the
competitive ones. According to the Boltzman distribution
(P ~ exp[—F / K71), the equilibrium population is exponentially
dependent on the binding free energy. A gap in binding free
energy or afﬁnity will lead to signiﬁcant population discrimin-
ation between the speciﬁc complex and alternative ones. As such,
introducing the consideration of speciﬁcity into the computa-
tional design of protein—protein interactions has achieve a few
successful applications (Bolon et al., 2005; Grigoryan et al., 2009;
Havranek et al., 2003; Kortemme et al., 2004; Shifman and
Mayo, 2003). These work designed interactions that seek to sta-
bilize the desired structures and also destabilize the competitive
structures, as the speciﬁcity-related interactions lie in the binding
patches constituting the interface of the complex (Malod-Dognin
et al., 2012). Thus, to develop a scoring function, the strategy
should satisfy the requirement that the stability of the speciﬁc
complex is maximized, whereas the stability of competing com-
plexes is minimized, which can guarantee both the stability and
the speciﬁcity for the speciﬁc complex.

The conventional deﬁnition of speciﬁcity is the preference of a
protein ligand speciﬁcally binding to a protein receptor over
other competitive alternatives (Bolon et al., 2005; Grigoryan
et al., 2009; Havranek et al., 2003; Janin, 1995;Kortemme
et al., 2004; Shifman and Mayo, 2003). The deﬁnition is clear,
although in practice, the quantiﬁcation of the conventional spe-
ciﬁcity still remains challenging (Grigoryan et al., 2009). The
conventional speciﬁcity requires comparison of the afﬁnities of
all the different protein receptors with the same protein ligand
(Fig. 1a). This makes the practical quantiﬁcation of the speciﬁ-
city impossible, as the receptor universe is huge, and the infor-
mation is often incomplete on the competitive alternatives. To
circumvent the challenge, we have proposed a novel concept
named as intrinsic speciﬁcity, which had been successfully
applied in the receptor—ligand (where the ligand is small molecule
and the receptor is the protein) system WVang and Verkhivker,
2003; Wang et al., 2007; Yan and Wang, 2012). Here, we apply
the concept to the protein—protein system. The intrinsic speciﬁ-
city refers to the preference in afﬁnity of a protein ligand binding
to its protein receptor with a preferred pose over other poses
(Fig. 1b). Imagining the N— and C-terminus of multiple protein
receptors is linked together, resulting in an effective single large
receptor; then the conventional speciﬁcity can be transformed to
the intrinsic speciﬁcity that a ligand binds to the large receptor
covering the whole universe of proteins with a preferred pose
over other poses (Fig. 1). The equivalence of conventional spe-
ciﬁcity and intrinsic speciﬁcity is under the assumption that the
protein receptor is sufﬁciently large to represent the whole uni-
verse of proteins and their interfaces. In reality, there is only
ﬁnite number of protein folds (~1300) in nature (Andreeva
et al., 2008). Thus, the protein receptor may not need to be in-
ﬁnitely large to represent the whole universe of proteins. A
reasonable size of protein surface may provide a few of the
diversiﬁed interfacial interactions presumably formed by the
whole universe of proteins.

The process of protein—protein binding can be physically
quantiﬁed and visualized as a funnel-like energy landscape
towards the native binding state with local roughness along the
binding paths (Bryngelson et al., 1995; Dominy and

linked together

Shakhnovich, 2004; Janin, 1996; Levy et al., 2004; Liu et al.,
2004b; Miller and Dill, 1997; Rejto and Verkhivker, 1996; Tsai
et al., 1999; Wang and Verkhivker, 2003; Wang et al., 2007). The
native conformation of the complex is the conformation with the
lowest binding energy. The energies of the conformation ensem-
ble follow a statistical Gaussian-like distribution. According to
the theory of energy landscape, the intrinsic speciﬁcity ratio
(ISR = A‘SE—f/E, where (SE is the energy gap between the energy
of native conformation and the average energy of conformation
ensemble, AE is the energy roughness or the width of the energy
distribution of the conformation ensemble and S is the conform-
ational entropy) can be deﬁned to quantify the magnitude of
intrinsic speciﬁcity. The ISR indicates the capability of discrimi-
nating the native binding conformation from other non-native
ones for a particular protein ligand on its receptor. The ISR can
be readily quantiﬁed with computationally generated non-native
poses (decoys). Therefore, ISR physically provides a quantitative
measure of the thermodynamic speciﬁcity without evaluating the
conventional speciﬁcity through exploring the whole set of re-
ceptor universe.

In this work, we designed a strategy for developing the
scoring function of protein—protein interactions to maximize
the afﬁnity and speciﬁcity simultaneously. The idea of the strat-
egy is to adjust the statistical knowledge-based potentials of atom
pairs by iteration until the scoring function can discriminate the
native binding pose against the decoys. The developing proced-
ure is shown in Supplementary Figure 51. We tested the derived
scoring function of protein—protein interactions (named as
SPA-PP) via the performance on the identiﬁcation of native
binding pose and the prediction of binding afﬁnity, and we
made comparisons with the results calculated by the widely
used software RosettaDock and two other existing scoring
functions.

Quantification of protein-protein interactions

 

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Preparation of the datasets

The dataset of protein—protein complexes for developing SPA-PP was
extracted from the Dockground resource (Douguet et al., 2006), which
provides a dynamic generation of dataset of protein—protein complexes
based on the user-deﬁned ﬁltering criteria. To drive a high quality set of
pairwise non-redundant protein—protein complexes of training dataset
and testing dataset, a series of ﬁltering criteria were composed on the
Dockground resource. Only the dimeric complexes solved by X-ray
diffraction with resolutions better than 2.5A were selected. The se-
quence identity (<70%) between each two complexes was used to dis-
card redundant structures. The dimeric structures with true biological
interfaces were kept by checking the head lines of the pdb ﬁles with
remarks ‘AUTHOR DETERMINED BIOLOGICAL UNIT:
DIMERIC’ or ‘SOFTWARE DETERMINED QUATERNARY
STRUCTURE: DIMERIC’ or both of them. The threshold number
of interface residues were set to be >30. The resulting dataset contains
3045 dimeric protein—protein complexes, including 2648 homodimers
and 397 heterodimers (Supplementary Table S1). This dataset was ran-
domly partitioned into two equal subsamples, one subsample is assigned
as the training dataset and the other one as the testing dataset (named
as testing datasetl).

In addition to the aforementioned testing datasetl, a benchmark data-
set for testing was also collected. It combines three available protein—
protein benchmarks. The ﬁrst benchmark is the non-redundant
protein—protein docking benchmark version 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010),
which contains 176 complexes. The second benchmark is the
Dockground benchmark (Gao et al., 2007), which contains 233 com-
plexes. The third benchmark is an afﬁnity benchmark (Kastritis et al.,
2011), which contains 144 complexes with measured dissociation con-
stants. By keeping one entry if there are overlaps among the pdb lists
of these three protein—protein benchmarks, the remaining 325 complexes
constitute our benchmark dataset (Supplementary Table S2), which
covers all available benchmarks of protein—protein complexes. For con-
venience, this benchmark dataset was named as testing dataset2. Both
testing datasetl and dataset2 were used for the validation of ability of
binding pose prediction for SPA-PP, and among the testing dataset2, the
144 complexes with experimental measured afﬁnities were used for the
validation of the ability of binding afﬁnity prediction for SPA-PP.

2.2 Preparation of docking decoys

To develop SPA-PP, an ensemble of decoys is needed to calculate the ISR
and carry out the iteration algorithm. The RosettaDock v3.2.1 was taken
as the structure optimizing and docking tool (Chaudhury et al., 2011;
Gray et al., 2003) for both the training and testing complexes. Three steps
were performed. First, each docking partner of the complex was prepared
in isolation for optimizing their side-chain conformations before docking
using the pre-packing protocol. Second, the pre-packed complexes were
then relaxed and minimized with high resolution by the reﬁnement proto-
col. Third, the reﬁned structures were taken as the starting structures for
the docking using the local docking perturbation protocol. The smaller
protein was deﬁned as the docking ligand in the complex, and the other
was assigned as the receptor, which was kept ﬁxed during docking.
Thousand ligand orientations for each complex were generated by dock-
ing. Other docking parameters were set as default. The generated decoys
are normally structured diversely with Irms (interface Co, root-mean-
square displacement between the native conformation and docked
decoys) ranging from small to large values. Three example complexes
with small, middle and large number of interfacial residues are shown
in Supplementary Figure S2 to illustrate the structural diversity of the
decoys.

2.3 Derivation of observed statistical potentials

The knowledge-based statistical scoring function needs a set of distance-
dependent atom-pair potentials to quantify the interactions. In our work,
the initial observed atom-pair potentials were directly derived from the
Boltzmann relation widely used in the knowledge-based statistical poten-
tials (Jiang et al., 2002; Koppensteiner and Sippl, 1998; Su et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2005a), which is

uzbs (r) = —KBT ln gzbs (r) (1)

where ggbs (r) is the observed pair distribution function, which can be
calculated by

12:30)
12%) '

fzbs (r) is the observed number density of atom-pair k within a spherical
shell between r and r + Sr, and the fzbs (R) is the number density within
the sphere of the reference state where there are no interactions between
atoms. The former can be directly extracted from the database of pro-
tein—protein complexes, whereas the later was obtained based on the ap-
proximation that the atom-pair k is uniformly distributed in the sphere of
the reference state (Sippl, 1990). Respectively, they were calculated as

 

$10 = (2)

 

S _ 1 M nm(r)
S 1 M
f7? (R) = M Em :—V(;) (4)

where M is the total number (3045) of native protein—protein complexes
extracted from the Dockground resource, nZ1(r) and N? are the numbers
of atom-pair k within the spherical shell and the reference sphere,
respectively, for a given protein—protein complex m, where
N? = 2, 11210). V(r) =§n((r+ Ar)3 —r3) and V(R) =§nR3 are the
volumes of the spherical shell and the reference sphere, respectively,
where Ar is the bin size and R is the radius of sphere. Ar and R are
set as 0.3 A and 6.4 A, respectively. There are 14 spherical shells with bin
size 0.3  from the shortest radius 2.2 Based on the deﬁnition of atom
type by SYBYL (Clark et al., 1989), 12 atom types were used to cover the
heavy atoms involved in protein—protein interactions (Supplementary
Table S3), these atom types were converted from PDB ﬁles by
OpenBabel (Guha et al., 2006). These atom types lead to 78 types of
atom pairs for the protein—protein interactions. There are 1092 types of
interaction pair by multiplying the number of atom pairs (78) and the
number of shells (14).

2.4 Derivation of expected statistical potentials

The observed statistical potentials have its limitations, as the statistical
potentials extracted from Equation (1) is not exactly the expected poten-
tials that nature uses to stabilize the complexes (Thomas and Dill, 1996a).
The origin of this problem lies in the construction of the reference state
where the atom pairs are uniformly distributed and independent of each
other (Sippl, 1990). In reality, the protein interactions involve the
excluded volume, sequences and connectivity. Thus, the observed statis-
tical potentials are always not equal to the expected potentials (Thomas
and Dill, 1996b). To solve the reference state issue and improve the stat-
istical potentials, earlier efforts (Goldstein et al., 1992; Huang and Zou,
2008; Muegge and Martin, 1999; Thomas and Dill, 1996a; Zhang et al.,
2005b) taking different approaches have been devoted in optimizing the
statistical potentials. An effective way is to take into account both native
and non-native conformations (decoys) (Goldstein et al., 1992; Huang
and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a) based on the energy landscape
theory (Goldstein et al., 1992; Levy et al., 2004) that the native conforrn—
ation should be sufﬁciently favored over alternative non-native structures

thermodynamically. However, none of the earlier works combined both
the speciﬁcity and afﬁnity to discriminate native conformation over non-
native conformations of protein—protein docking. In this work, we
considered the importance of both the afﬁnity for stabilizing the native
conformation and the speciﬁcity of discrimination over non-native
conformations to optimize the statistical potentials. We used the iterative
method (Huang and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a) shown in the
next subsection to realize the optimization.

Similarly as the observed statistical potentials, the expected statistical
potentials are calculated as

ulixp (r) = —KBT ln glixp (r) (5)

where glixp (r) is the expected pair distribution function from all the native

and non-native conformations, which is

2 12%)
f7.” (R)
Given the population discrimination of the native and non-native con-
formations, the expected number density of atom-pair k was calculated

with Boltzmann-averaged weighting over the ensemble of conformations
(Huang and Zou, 2008; Thomas and Dill, 1996a), that is

where M is the number of native complexes aforementioned, and N is the
number of total conformations (1001, including the native conformation
and decoys) for each complex m. n represents the nth generated decoy of
the complex m. ,8 is an arbitrary constant analogous to the inverse of
temperature and set as 0.1. Umn is the parameter that is assumed to be
able to discriminate the naive conformation against decoys. As discussed,
both the stability and speciﬁcity are required to form a speciﬁc functional
complex. Thus, Umn is designed as a combination parameter coupling the
afﬁnity and ISR, which is given by

Umn = VEmn + Amn 

where Emn is the energy score of the protein—protein conformation
(nth decoy of the complex m) by summing over all the expected inter-
atomic pair potentials among the interface, representing the afﬁnity of the
protein—protein conformation. Am” is the ISR representing the speciﬁcity
of the protein—protein conformation Wang and Verkhivker, 2003; Wang
et al., 2007; Yan and Wang, 2012). y is a parameter that balances the
values of Em and Am” and is set as 0.01 because of the ratio of average
Em and Am”. Em and Am” are calculated as

 

Emn = Z Z Zil€(r)1"k(r) 
k r
A... a...  (11)

tk(r) represents the occurrence times of the atom-pair interaction between
the protein—protein interface. am is a scaling factor that accounts for the
contribution of the entropy to the speciﬁcity (am 2 #Sm, where Sm is the
conformational entropy of the complex m) Wang and Verkhivker, 2003).
Here, am approximately depends on the number of interfacial residues
(am ~ ) of the native protein—protein conformation of the complex m.
An interfacial residue is deﬁned if any atom of this residue in one partner
of the native protein—protein conformation is within 10A from the other
partner. am normalizes the increase of ISR with the number of interfacial
residues. SEW, is the energy gap between the energy of a given conform-

ation Em” and the average energy of the conformation ensemble < E; > ,

 

including the native conformation and all the decoys of the complex m,
AEmn is the energy roughness or the width of the energy distribution of
conformation ensemble, namely, SEW, = Emn — <15; > and
AEm, = ,/ <(E5n)2> — <E5n>2, < > means the average over the ensemble of
conformations.

2.5 Optimization of scoring function

The basic idea of the iterative method here is to circumvent the inaccess-
ible reference state problem by improving the statistical pair potentials
until they are able to discriminate native binding mode from decoys. The
expected potentials obtained from the ensemble of conformations gener-
ally are not equal to the potentials from the observed native conform-
ations. The difference between the expected statistical potentials and the
observed statistical potentials, as well as the iterative equation can be
expressed by

4115.0) = ui;(r) — quSU) (12)
“1.7110 = ui;(r) + xAuin) (13)

u;;(r) is the expected distance-dependant potentials ulixp (r) starting from

i = 0, and the new expected statistical distance-dependant pair potentials
ug+1)(r) was taken to compute the Em and Am”, as well as Um”, through
Equations (9—11). In return, the Umn was used to update the expected pair
potentials through Equations (5—9). Thus, the expected pair potentials
were adjusted with the difference Auﬂr) at each iteration step. The x
controls the speed of the convergence and was set as 0.1. The iterative
procedure was repeated until the success rate of the best-scored conform-
ations passing the high-quality accuracy of CAPRI criteria
(Supplementary Table S4) converges to a value (normally over 98.0%).
The ﬁnal set of the expected pair potentials constitutes the optimized
scoring function of protein—protein interactions, i.e. SPA-PP.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Optimized scoring function

A straightforward way to validate the effectiveness of the itera-
tive procedure on the improvement of the scoring function is to
show the evolution of the average RMSD of the best-scored
poses and the success rate of the best-scored poses passing high
accuracy of CAPRI evaluation criteria (Fig. 2a). It can be seen
that the success rate increases from 93.3% and converges to
98.1%, whereas the average RMSD decreases from 0.53 and
approaches to 0.17 as the adjusting of the scoring function via
iteration. Almost all the best-scored poses of the protein—protein
complexes in the training set are identiﬁed as the native conform-
ations by the optimized scoring function (SPA-PP), and the
structures of the best-scored poses are identical to their native
conformations with low RMSDs. This indicates that the accur-
acy of the statistical expected knowledge-based pair potentials
are improved gradually as the iteration continues until the con-
vergence is reached.

Our optimization strategy couples the adjustments of the af-
ﬁnity and speciﬁcity simultaneously. We can see that the distri-
bution of ISR value of pre-optimized and optimized SPA-PP is
clearly separated, and the average value of ISRs for the native
poses increases from 5.3 to 7.3 (Fig. 2b). It implies that the spe-
ciﬁcity of native conformation is more obvious, whereas the sta-
bility is more strengthened by the optimized SPA-PP. The results
validate that the performance of SPA-PP is optimized and

improved on characterizing both the stability and speciﬁcity of
the native pose.

To assess how different the docking predictions ranked by a
new scoring function from a random order, Feliu and Oliva.
(2010) proposed a statistical assessment of the performance of
a scoring function on determining the number of near-native
conformations among the top-ranked conformations. In this
work, we used its P—value calculation [details are in the Feliu
and Oliva (2010)] to get the number of successful cases among
our testing datasetl (320 complexes). A successful case is deﬁned
by considering at least one hit located in the top-ranked decoys
of the complex. The success curves (Supplementary Fig. S3)
show that the successful rate of optimized SPA-PP is much
better than that of random ordering. Also, compared with pre-
optimized SPA-PP, the successful rate of optimized SPA-PP is
improved after optimization. The statistical assessment indicates
that the optimization strategy is successful, and the optimized
SPA-PP could be an accurate scoring function on the predictions
of native pose identiﬁcation and binding afﬁnity ranking.

In the protein—protein docking problem, scoring functions are
generally used for two applications: (i) to score and rank the
binding poses generated by the docking programs and (ii) to
predict and explain the experimentally determined protein—pro-
tein afﬁnities. Thus, to evaluate the performance of SPA-PP, two
kinds of tests related to corresponding applications are carried
out, and the testing results are shown later.

3.2 Binding pose prediction

The purpose of protein—protein docking is to look for the native
or near-native binding mode for the assembly proteins. Whether
the scoring function can select out the best-scored binding pose
that resembles the native conformation determines the scoring
and ranking ability of the scoring function. Ideally, the scoring
function should be transferable and work equally for the diverse
protein—protein complexes. For this reason, the performance of
binding pose prediction for SPA-PP is tested on two diverse
testing datasets (testing datasetl and dataset2, for details see
Section 2).

The performances of identifying the native pose are compared
among the optimized SPA-PP, pre-optimized SPA-PP and the
energy function implemented in RosettaDock3.2.l (Table 1).
Also, to emphasize the importance of ISR on the optimization
of scoring function, the optimized scoring function, which is

obtained by only taking afﬁnity into the optimization (called
as Afﬁnity-PP), is also listed for comparison, i.e. Equation 9
becomes Um” = yEmn. The success rates of the native pose iden-
tiﬁcation for both testing datasets show that the optimized SPA-
PP performs much better than pre-optimized SPA-PP and even
better than RosettaDock whose force ﬁelds perform extremely
well for protein folding and protein assembly over other energy
functions (King et al., 2012; Schueler-Furman et al., 2005). This
suggests that optimized SPA-PP is successful on the ability to
identify native or near-native binding poses. The comparison of
Afﬁnity-PP and SPA-PP demonstrates that incorporation of ISR
into the optimization strategy improves the performance of the
scoring function on the identiﬁcation of native or near-native
binding poses. The high success rate also means that optimized
SPA-PP is effective to discriminate the native binding pose
against decoys, namely, able to characterize the speciﬁcity.

3.3 Binding afﬁnity prediction

In addition to the prediction of binding pose, the prediction of
binding afﬁnity is another important application of protein—pro-
tein scoring function (Kastritis and Bonvin, 2010). It determines
the accuracy of binding energy predicted by the scoring function
compared with the experimental measurements. Because of seal-
ing, the scoring functions usually can not reproduce the absolute
values of experimental binding afﬁnity; the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient (C p) between the predicted and experimental mea-
sured binding afﬁnities was computed. Among the 144 com-
plexes of afﬁnity benchmark set (Kastritis et al., 2011), 72
complexes are deﬁned as rigid docking complexes with
[ms 3 1.0A (interface Co, root-mean—square displacement be-
tween the bound and unbound complexes), and the remaining
are classiﬁed as ﬂexible docking complexes. This benchmark set
of binding afﬁnities contains a diverse set of protein—protein
complexes with reliable experimental binding afﬁnities and for
the ﬁrst time provides an opportunity for evaluating the perform-
ance of scoring functions on the binding afﬁnity prediction.
The correlations between the predicted and experimental afﬁ-
nities are shown in Table 2. The results of DFIRE (Liu et al.,
2004a) and PMF (Su et al., 2009) were obtained from the litera-
ture (Moal et al., 2011), and for consistence with this literature,
the complexes lUUG, lIQD, lNSN, 1DE4, 1M10, lNCA and
1NB5 were also excluded in the calculations. Compared with
RosettaDock, as well as other two scoring functions DFIRE
and PMF (Moal et al., 2011), the performance of SPA-PP for
the rigid docking complexes ranks best with Cp 2 0.63 (Table 2
and Fig. 3), and the Cp for all the benchmark set is only lower
than that of RosettaDock. The results indicate that SPA-PP is

Fig. 3. Pearson correlation between the predicted and experimental bind-
ing afﬁnities for the rigid docking complexes. The correlation coefﬁcient
(Cp) is 0.63 (statistical signiﬁcance P<0.001). The predicted afﬁnity is
obtained by sealing the binding scores with a linear equa-
tion:y=0.018 x —4.79, which is a ﬁtting equation based on the experi-
mental afﬁnities

not only capable of discriminating the native conformation
against non-native conformations but also accurately predicting
the binding afﬁnities for protein—protein binding without large
conformational change. The comparison of Afﬁnity-PP and
SPA-PP demonstrates that ISR is an important factor to
improve the performance of the scoring function. The speciﬁcity
is critical to the protein—protein interactions and necessary to be
incorporated to the optimization of scoring function. It is worth
noticing that for ﬂexible binding, SPA-PP, as well as other scor-
ing functions, performs poorly with C ps < 0.3. This is reasonable,
as the scoring function only captures the features of static struc-
ture and can not easily incorporate the information of conform-
ational change because of ﬂexibility. RosettaDock includes
minimization function during the docking process. This mini-
mization is restricted to the side-chain rotamers. That means
RosettaDock considers certain degrees of ﬂexibility into the
docking process. This might be the reason why RosettaDock
seems to be better in semi-rigid docking than others
(Supplementary Table S5). However, all scoring functions,

including RosettaDock, are bad in scoring performance on the
docking with large conformational changes. The computation-
ally efﬁcient treatment of large conformational changes during
binding still remains a challenge (Zacharias, 2010).

4 CONCLUSION

In this work, we developed a scoring function for protein—protein
interactions, named as SPA-PP. The development strategy of
SPA-PP takes into account of both speciﬁcity and afﬁnity of
protein—protein binding. It represents a signiﬁcant advance
over the previous investigations on protein—protein binding inter-
actions and scoring functions, which only focused on afﬁnity for
development. Also, we used the largest set of high-quality pro-
tein—protein structures so far for training the scoring function. It
makes SPA-PP independent on the training set and more general
for applications. The remarkable performance of SPA-PP was
validated by testing the ability on the predictions of native pose
and binding afﬁnity. The success of SPA-PP demonstrates that
the speciﬁcity is critical to the protein—protein interactions and
necessary to be incorporated to the scoring function and the
computational design of the protein—protein interactions. SPA-
PP is a kind of statistical pair-potentials, which are discrete po-
tentials dependent on the distances between the interacting atom
pairs. The statistical pair-potentials incorporate multiple energy
terms, such as van der Waals interactions, electrostatic inter-
actions and hydrophobic interactions, into one potential energy
term. Therefore, the computational docking procedure with
SPA-PP could cost less computational time if SPA-PP is imple-
mented into the sampling and ranking of protein—protein
binding.

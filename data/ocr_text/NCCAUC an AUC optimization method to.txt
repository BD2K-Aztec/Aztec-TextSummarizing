Abstract

Motivation: In prognosis and survival studies, an important goal is to identify multi—biomarker pan—
els with predictive power using molecular characteristics or clinical observations. Such analysis is
often challenged by censored, small—sample—size, but high—dimensional genomic profiles or clinical
data. Therefore, sophisticated models and algorithms are in pressing need.

Results: In this study, we propose a novel Area Under Curve (AUC) optimization method for multi—
biomarker panel identification named Nearest Centroid Classifier for AUC optimization (NCC—AUC).
Our method is motived by the connection between AUC score for classification accuracy evaluation
and Harrell’s concordance index in survival analysis. This connection allows us to convert the sur—
vival time regression problem to a binary classification problem. Then an optimization model is for—
mulated to directly maximize AUC and meanwhile minimize the number of selected features to
construct a predictor in the nearest centroid classifier framework. NCC—AUC shows its great per—
formance by validating both in genomic data of breast cancer and clinical data of stage 18 Non—
Small—Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC). For the genomic data, NCC—AUC outperforms Support Vector
Machine (SVM) and Support Vector Machine—based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM—RFE) in
classification accuracy. It tends to select a multi—biomarker panel with low average redundancy and
enriched biological meanings. Also NCC—AUC is more significant in separation of low and high risk
cohorts than widely used Cox model (Cox proportional—hazards regression model) and L1—Cox
model (L1 penalized in Cox model). These performance gains of NCC—AUC are quite robust across 5
subtypes of breast cancer. Further in an independent clinical data, NCC—AUC outperforms SVM and
SVM—RFE in predictive accuracy and is consistently better than Cox model and L1—Cox model in
grouping patients into high and low risk categories.

Conclusion: In summary, NCC—AUC provides a rigorous optimization framework to systematically
reveal multi—biomarker panel from genomic and clinical data. It can serve as a useful tool to identify
prognostic biomarkers for survival analysis.

1 Introduction

Survival analysis studies the time to occurrence of a certain event.
Identifying significant biomarkers for prediction is longstanding as
an important topic to provide better understanding. Here one key
challenge is that the outcome variable of interest for survival ana—
lysis is sometimes censored, which means the survive time is only
partially known. In addition, the candidate features are always in
high-dimension with the rapid development of high—throughput
measurement technologies. As a result, discovering feature combin—
ations is suffering from ‘curse of dimensionality’. How to overcome
the above difficulties and identify the most accurate prognostic
multi-biomarker panel from survival data to assist clinicians is the
problem we want to address.

The most widely used model for survival analysis is Cox propor—
tional—hazards regression model (Cox model). It can handle the cen—
sored survival data in a rigorous way (Breslow, 1975 ; David, 1972)
and provides an estimation of the hazard ratio and its confidence
interval. However, Cox model directly utilizes the noisy and cen—
sored data to predict the survival ratio thus often leads to poor prog—
nosis. Also Cox model uses all features with high dimensionality in
general. It is trained on a particular dataset and usually generalized
poorly to other independent datasets. To avoid overfitting, L1 penal—
ized Cox model (Ll—Cox model) was proposed to perform variable
selection and shrinkage, which makes it very useful for de-noising
and identifying the most meaningful features (Goeman, 2010).
Nonetheless, both Cox model and L1—Cox model heavily depend on
the quality of input survival time.

In reality, Harrell’s Concordance Index (CI) is a widely used per—
formance measure for assessing prediction models in survival ana—
lysis. The main idea is that it doesn’t consider the value of survival
time but the rank of patients by their survival times (Harrell et 61].,
1982, 1996). In DREAM Breast Cancer Prognosis Challenge, chal—
lenge models will be scored by calculating the CI between the pre—
dicted survival and the true survival information in the validation
dataset. The final assessment of models and the determination of the
best performer will be based on the CI of predictions on the test
dataset (http://www.the—dream—project.org/). Recently, CI is used to
assess the clinical utility of cancer genomic and proteomic data
across tumor types in The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project
(Yuan et 61]., 2014).

In this sense, it is natural to directly optimize CI to select bio—
markers and construct predictive models. However maximizing CI
is a non—convex optimization problem with non—differentiable ob—
jective function and hard to solve (Steck et 61]., 2008). We notice
that CI and AUC (Area Under ROC Curve) are identical and equate
the Mann—Whitney statistics in the absence of censored data (Koziol
and Jia, 2009; Wolf et 61]., 2011). We could use AUC to assess the
classification accuracy and further to approximate CI. With this
connection, our motivation is to convert survival time regression to
a binary classification problem and then maximizing AUC. For ex-
ample, we choose the 5—year threshold in practice without loss of
generality, i.e. we predict whether the patient can live longer than 5
years. In clinical study, the 5 —year survival rate is commonly used as
a survival rate for estimating the prognosis of a particular disease. It
serves as a general accepted standard by the American Cancer
Society to assess the cancer malignancy. In addition, 5—year thresh-
old leads to the balanced positive and negative datasets
(Supplemental Table S4). In this way we focus to solve a classifica—
tion problem about maximizing AUC.

Classical classification methods, such as support vector machine
(Shivaswamy et 61]., 2007; Van Belle et 61]., 2011), logistic regression

(Efron, 1988), k-nearest neighbor (Parry et 61]., 2010), have been
widely used in survival analysis and achieved good performance.
Moreover, Heagerty et al. (2000) proposed the time—dependent
AUC, which was adopted as evaluation for the model performance
(Bonato et 61]., 2011; Cerhan et 61]., 2007; Simon et 61]., 2011).
Nevertheless, none of these methods optimize AUC directly to con—
struct classifiers.

AUC is an important performance measure that has been widely
used (Metz, 1978). Some algorithms have been developed to opti—
mize AUC based on surrogate loss (Herschtal and Raskutti, 2004;
Zhao et 61]., 2011). Those technologies can be borrowed in optimiz-
ing AUC to deal with the censored survival data. Meanwhile, the
rapidly developed high—throughput measuring techniques usually
generate high dimensional genomic or clinical data. Feature selec—
tion is necessary along with model estimation to reduce data dimen—
sion and model complexity. Also it helps to provide intuitive
understanding. Here, we denote selected features having potential
diagnostic usage as biomarkers. Importantly, features combine in
linear or nonlinear ways to improve diagnostic accuracy. This useful
feature combination is named as multi—biomarker panel.

It’s a challenging task to select a biomarker subset to maximize
accuracy in computation. Here wrapper methods give a good ex—
ample for its complexity. The idea of these state—of—art feature selec—
tion algorithms is to use each subset to train a model and then test
on a hold—out dataset. Since wrapper methods need to go through all
the possible subsets, they are computationally intensive. For ex-
ample if there are 50 features, it should train 250 models to select the
best subset by comparing models’ error rates on the hold—out valid—
ation dataset. To reduce the computational complexity, some heur—
istic methods have been proposed. For example, Support Vector
Machine—based Recursive Feature Elimination (SVM—RFE) has be-
come one of the leading methods and is being widely used (Guyon
et 61]., 2002). It adopts an intuitive strategy to remove a feature with
the smallest coefficient in SVM model one step. We note that this
stepwise feature selection strategy may miss some critical feature
combinations.

In this article, we convert the survival time regression to a classi—
fication problem aiming to select a small group of biomarkers and
maximize AUC score. Specially, we propose a single optimization
model based on nearest centroid classifier with feature selection,
which maximizes AUC and minimizes the number of selected fea—
tures simultaneously. To make the computation tractable, maximiz-
ing AUC is slacked to minimize a loss function. Meanwhile, we use
L1 ‘norm’ to minimize the number of selected features instead of L0
‘norm’ thus make it could be efficiently solved by a linear program—
ming. Finally our method predicts whether a patient survives longer
than 5 years in a fast and efficient way. To validate the performance,
we apply the new method to gene expression data of breast cancer
and clinical data of stage IB Non—Small—Cell Lung Cancer (NSCLC).
The results show that our method can identify panels of biomarkers
with good survival prediction performance.

2 Methods
2.1 Overview of NCC—AUC

We propose a novel method based on nearest centroid classifier and
maximize classification accuracy by AUC. Simultaneously, we min—
imize the number of features to select the best multi—biomarker
panel for survival prediction. To make the computation efficient, we
approximate AUC by a loss function. Meanwhile the number of
features (L0 ‘norm’) is approximated by the sum of probability for

selecting the features (L1 ‘norm’). To balance these two objectives, a
parameter 2 is introduced to formulate the model as a single—object—
ive—function optimization problem. Solving the optimization prob—
lem allows us to select a panel of biomarkers to assist survival
prediction (Fig. 1). We name our method as NCC—AUC (Nearest
Centroid Classifier for AUC optimization).

2.2 Survival time classification
As shown in Figure 1, the identification of patients with longer survival
time is treated here as a binary classification problem. We apply a
threshold (5 years) to the survival time to each patient and classify all
the patients into two groups: positive samples are patients living shorter
than 5 years and negative samples are those patients living longer than
5 years. For the censored data, we only keep the patients with censored
time above 5 years and classified them as negative samples.

Assume that we have 11 positive samples X1,X2, - - - ,Xn and m
negative samples Y1, Y2, - - - , Ym. Each sample is represented by a p—
dimensional feature vector. Then the centroids of the positive and

. 7‘ x- T Y- .
negative classes are 11+ : % and ,u_ = % respectively.

The idea of nearest centroids is intuitive. If X is a positive sam—
ple, it should satisfy,

||X — M+|| < “X — 11—“ (1)
Dealing with the L2 ‘norm’ leads to

ZXTUL — (a) < “ll—H2 — ||M+||2 (2)

Similarly, if X is a negative sample, it should satisfy,

2X0“, — m < ||u+||2 — “ll—HZ <3)

Let w : 11+ — ,u_ and b : —(||u+||2 — ||,u_||2)/2, then we get a linear
classifier,

(:00 = wTX+ b = (u, — mTX — (llmllz — llu_||2)/2 (4)

When X is a positive sample, C(X) : wTX —l— b > 0. When X is a
negative sample, C(X) : wTX —l— b < 0.

It is not fair to evaluate a classifier by only a cutoff such as zero.
AUC is a good settlement for such problem by considering pairwise
comparison. Specially, the AUC of the classier C(X) should be

AUC =  :m:I<C(X,-) — C(Y))> (5)

i=1 j:

1 x>0

where I(x) : {

However, the classifier deals with all the features without differ—

ence. Noise will be added and the dominate features won’t be found.
We introduce a feature selection variable 0, which is a p—dimensional
vector.

Fig. 1. The flowchart of our NCC-AUC method. Step 1, we group patients into
positive and negative samples by thresholding the survival time. Step 2, by
utilizing nearest centroid classifier, we maximize the classification accuracy
(AUC) and minimize the number of selected features simultaneously. To bal-
ance the two objectives, we introduce a parameter A to formulate it as an opti-
mization problem with a single objective function. Step 3, by solving the
optimization model, we could select a panel of features which maximizes its
AUC score in classification

2.3 Constructing optimization model
Specifically, we want to find a vector 0 to maximize the objective
function as follows,

AUC = i: Edda, x,) — C(e, Y») (7)
i=1 i=1
As the paper (Zhao et al., 2011) states, the value of AUC(0) keeps
the same for the classifier coC(0,X) where co > 0, therefore, we
only consider the situation 020.

Ideally, we would want the score for positive samples to be
higher than that for negative samples, which yields 1 for the AUC
and completely differentiates positive and negative samples. This
could be measured by the Mann—Whitney U test (Siegel, 1956) to
test whether the positive samples ranked higher than negative sam-
ples P(X > Y).

We note that 1 — AUC(0) can be interpreted as the misclassifica—
tion rate. Then we formulate the feature selection and classification

problem aimed for minimizing the misclassification rate (maximiz-

ing the AUC score).
min 1 — AUC(0)
020

However the objective function of this optimization problem is
non—convex. For efficient computation, it is sensible to minimize a
convex surrogate loss function. We choose the hinge loss function
used in support vector machine as,

where x+ : xI(x > 0).
So the problem can be simplified as follows,

2.4 Parameter tuning

Parameter 2 is a single parameter to be tuned in our model. We
chose 2 by two steps: primary adjustment and further adjustment. In
primary adjustment, we tested 0.00001, 0.0001, 0.001, 0.01, 0.1, 1,
10, 100, 1000, 10 000, 100 000 for A. Then the best parameter 2 is
obtained by comparing the sum of training and validating AUCs.
Next step we selected the interval containing the best parameter 2
for further adjustment. For example, we selected interval [0.001,
0.1] if the best parameter 2 = 0.01 was obtained by the primary ad—
justment. Further, we set step length as 0.01 and selected optimal 2
in interval [0.001, 0.1]. Larger 2 means fewer selected features and
larger misclassification rate. In this way we balanced these two
terms in the objective function and selected parameter 2 with smaller
misclassification and relative fewer features. All the calculations
were calculated by MATLAB R2013a environment on a computer
3.40 GHz Inter Core i7—2600CPU and 16 GB memory.

2.5 Datasets

We validated our method both in genomic data and clinical data.

1. Gene expression proﬁles of breast cancer: Molecular Taxonomy
of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC) con-
tains patients’ overall survival time, expression proﬁles, and

PAM50 subtype annotations of 1981 breast tumors collected from
participants of the METABRIC trial (Curtis et al., 2012). This
dataset was accessed through Synapse (synapse.sagebase.org). The
gene expression proﬁles contain 49 576 probe sets of 1981 patients
with 328 basal—like tumors, 238 HER2—l— tumors, 719 luminal A,
490 luminal B and 200 normal—like tumors. In each subtype, we
randomly selected 50—60% samples as training cohort
(Supplemental Table S4).

2. Clinical data of lung cancer: The clinical data of lung cancer was
downloaded from http://jco.ascopubs.org/content/27/7/1091/
suppl and it contained 148 stage IB NSCLC patients with 37 bio—
markers (Zhu et al., 2009). The 37 biomarkers included age,
gender, cancer—cell type, tumor diameter and 33 immunohisto—
chemistry biomarkers. We randomly selected approximate 2/3
samples as training cohort and the others were validation
cohort.

3 Results

3.1 Performance on gene expression profiles

of breast cancer

3.1.1 Functional gene panel identified by NCC-AUC in

basal-like subtype

Frist of all, we divided the patients into two groups by the fact that
if a patient could survive more than 5 years or not. We selected sig—
nificance genes by t—test and kept the 2101 genes with
P-value<0.001. In Basal—like subtype, we randomly selected 200
samples from 328 samples as training cohort and the others are
treated as validation cohort. NCC—AUC selects 97 genes with train—
ing AUC : 1 and validation AUC : 0.7207 (Fig. 2A) by setting
2 = 0.001. Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian
et al., 2005) reveals that these genes contain 22 up—regulated genes
with q—value < 10‘15 and 15 down—regulated genes with q—value <
10‘7 in basal—like subtype (Smid et al., 2008; Supplementary Table
S1). GSEA also shows that these genes contain 16 genes which could
discriminate basal—like subtype from luminal subtype with q—value
< 10_13 (Farmer et al., 2005 ). These evidences support that the se—
lected genes are closely correlated with basal—like subtype.

3.1.2 NCC-AUC outperforms SVM and SVM-RFE in basal-like
subtype

The main advantage of NCC—AUC is to optimize classification ac—
curacy and select the best biomarker panel in a single model. Here
we demonstrate the performance gain of our NCC—AUC by compar—
ing with SVM and SVM—RFE. SVM is a supervised learning model
and has been widely used in machine learning (Cortes and Vapnik,
1995) to achieve high accuracy in classifying a small set of samples.
SVM—RFE is one of the most successful wrapper methods in feature
selection (Guyon et al., 2002). SVM—RFE conducts feature selection
in a sequential backward elimination manner, which starts with all
the features and discards one feature at a time by checking the classi—
fication accuracy. SVM and SVM—RFE are implemented by
MATLAB R2013a with default parameters.

SVM gets AUC : 1 in training cohort while 0.5187 in validation
cohort in basal—like subtype dataset (Fig. 2A). This shows that it’s
necessary to remove redundancy genes to avoid overfitting. If we
add the feature selection option in SVM, SVM—RFE identifies a
panel of 53 genes with performance of AUC : 1 in training cohort
and AUC: 0.5513 in validation cohort (Fig. 2A). NCC—AUC per—
forms better with AUC : 0.7207 in validation cohort and the same
AUC in training cohort. The improvement is due to the fact that

NCC—AUC optimizes AUC directly while SVM and SVM—RFE opti—
mize the classification error. Also NCC—AUC regularizes the number
of selected feature in a simultaneous way while SVM—RFE in a step—
wise way. In conclusion, NCC—AUC shows advantage in classifica—
tion and outperforms SVM—RFE in basal—like subtype.

3.1.3 NCC-AUC outperforms Cox model and L1-Cox model in
basal-like subtype

To show the advantage to treat the survival time regression problem
as a binary classification problem, we compared our NCC—AUC
with Cox model and L1 penalized in Cox model. In survival analysis,
Cox model and L1—Cox model are typical methods to fully make use
of the survival time while our NCC—AUC only uses whether the sur—
vival time is longer than 5 years. Cox model is one of most classical
model in survival analysis, and shows efficiency for censored data
(Efron, 1977). L1 penalized Cox model has the property that it sim—
ultaneously performs variable selection and shrinkage, which makes
it very useful for finding interpretable prediction rules in high-di-
mensional data (Goeman, 2010). Cox model and L1—Cox model are
implemented by R package ‘survival’ and ‘penalized’ with default
parameters.

To investigate Kaplan—Meier analysis for the multiple-biomarker
panel by NCC—AUC, we selected cutoff score based on ROC ana—
lysis. The score close to the point with best sensitivity and specificity
balance was selected as the cutoff. Then we could classify samples
into two classes in training and validation cohorts with the panel se—
lected by NCC—AUC. In basal—like subtype, there are 114 predicted
low risk samples and 86 predicted high risk samples in training co-
hort. Log—rank test demonstrates that the two groups have signifi—
cant P—value < 0.00001 (Fig. 3A). In validation cohort, there are 78
predicted low risk samples and 50 predicted high risk samples. Log—
rank test shows that P—value is significant (0.009) (Fig. 3B). In com—
parison, Cox model also shows significant difference between
predicted low risk patients and predicted high patients with
P-value < 0.00001 in training cohort but not significant with P-
value = 0.235 in validation cohort (Fig. 3C, 3D). With feature selec—
tion strategy, L1—Cox model identifies a panel of 53 genes and gets
P-value < 0.00001 in training cohort and P—value: 0.735 in valid—
ation cohort (Fig. 3E, 3F). Here we selected the median value as the
cutoff for Cox model and L1—Cox model to convenient compare
with NCC—AUC. Therefore, NCC—AUC performs better than Cox
model and L1—Cox model in basal—like subtype.

3.1.4 NCC-AUC outperforms SVM, SVM-RFE, Cox model and
Ll-Cox model across other subtypes

We applied NCC—AUC to other subtypes of breast cancer and com—
pared with SVM, SVM—RFE in classification accuracy. In Her2—l—
subtype, NCC—AUC identifies 57 genes with AUC : 0.7051 in valid—

and (F) show the results in training and validation cohort for L1-Cox model

SVM-RFE with AUC : 0.6208 (Fig. 2B). In other three subtypes, we
also get consistent improvement (Fig. 2C—E). Especially in normal-
like subtype, our method improves AUC from 0.6006 (SVM—RFE)
to 0.7810 in validation cohort (Fig. 2E). These demonstrate that
NCC—AUC outperforms classical classification model SVM and
SVM—RFE across different subtypes.

In addition, we compared NCC—AUC with Cox model and
L1—Cox model to show its advantage in survival analysis. In
luminalA subtype, log—rank test shows that Cox model (P—
value:0.630) is non—significant and L1-Cox model (P-
value:0.001) indicates significant difference between predicted
high risk patients and predicted low risk patients in validation co—
hort (Fig. 4). Nevertheless, NCC—AUC shows better significance
than L1—Cox model in validation cohort (P—value<0.00001). In
luminalB subtype, both Cox model (P—value:0.063) and L1—Cox
model (P—value:0.303) are not significant but NCC—AUC (P—
value = 0.00005) shows significance in validation cohort. In normal-
like and Her2—I— subtype, NCC—AUC also shows much better

Fig. 4. Kaplan-Meier survival estimation for other subtypes of breast cancer in
validation cohorts by NCC-AUC, Cox model and L1-Cox model. NCC-AUC
shows consistent improvement over existing methods

performance than Cox model and L1—Cox model (Fig. 4). These evi—
dence strongly support that NCC—AUC outperforms classical sur—
vival analysis method Cox model and L1—Cox model across subtypes
of breast cancer.

3.1.5 The performance gain by NCC-AUC is robust

The performance gain by NCC—AUC is robust to the random split—
ting of training and validation cohorts. To demonstrate this, we ran—
domly selected 200 samples from 328 samples as training cohort in
basal—like subtype and the others are in validation cohort. The pro—
cedure was repeated by 100 times. SVM and SVM—RFE serve as con—
trol (Fig. 5A). The mean AUC of NCC—AUC is 0.7264 and the
variance is 0.0012. It significantly improves the results of SVM
0.5337 (P—value < 10‘”, Student’s t—test) and SVM-RFE 0.5879 (P-

0T74, Student’s t—test), respectively. Those side—by—side

value < 1
comparisons show that NCC—AUC is a robust method and it is not
inﬂuenced by randomly sampling the training cohort.

To look at the consistent improvement for the different thresh-
olds, we also took threshold as 3, 4, 6, 7 years to divide the patients
into two groups in the basal—like subtype. NCC—AUC consistently
outperforms SVM and SVM—RFE at different thresholds
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Moreover, we compared NCC—AUC with
Cox model and L1—Cox model. Results show that the improvement
of NCC—AUC is robust (Supplementary Fig. S2).

To demonstrate NCC—AUC is robust at different thresholds, we
randomly selected 200 samples from 328 samples as training cohort
in basal—like subtype 100 times. Then the time—dependent AUC
(Heagerty et al., 2000) of validation cohort at different thresholds
can be obtained. The results demonstrate that NCC—AUC is robust
at the threshold:5, 6, 7 years by Student’s t—test (Supplementary
Fig. S3).

3.1.6 NCC-AUC selects biological meaningful biomarkers with
low redundancy

NCC—AUC is efficient in selecting biomarkers with low redundancy
and identifying plausible biomarkers consistent with existing anno—
tations and previous study. Good multi—biomarker panel should be a
set of non—redundant and complementary biomarkers that maintain
the maximal classification ability. To show NCC—AUC can select
low redundancy biomarkers, we proposed a mean redundancy score

and compared NCC—AUC with L1—Cox model and SVM-RFE in
basal—like subtype. Here we evaluated biomarker redundancy by the
mean redundancy score among the identified biomarkers. Given a
set of biomarkers, the average redundant score is defined as the aver—
age of pairwise Pearson Correlation Coefficients (PCC). The bio—
marker redundancy of NCC—AUC is 0.3897 and the improvements
compared to L1—Cox model and SVM—RFE are significant: 0.5504
(P-value< 10‘141, Student’s t—test) and 0.5251 (P—value< 10‘107,
Student’s t—test), respectively (Fig. 5B).

To demonstrate that NCC—AUC can select more plausible bio—
markers than L1—Cox model and SVM—RFE, we further applied
GSEA for the genes identified L1—Cox model, and SVM—RFE and
compared with NCC—AUC. Results show that SVM—RFE selects one
gene set (SMID_BREAST_CANCER_BASAL_UP) closely associated
with basal—like subtype (Supplementary Table S2). While NCC—
AUC selects three gene sets related to basal—like subtype
(SMID_BREAST_CANCER_BASAL_UP, FARMER_BREAST _CA
NCER_BASAL_VS_LULMINAL, SMID_BREAST_CANC—ER_BAS
AL_DN). Although SMID_BREAST_CANCER_BASA- L_UP shows
up in both results, our NCC—AUC gets a 22 gene overlap with a sig—
nificant q—value (1.79E—16). SVM—RFE obtains a 9 gene overlap
with a q—value 1.10E—04. For L1—Cox model, it can select 50 genes
which overlap significantly with the three gene sets related to basal—
like subtype (Supplementary Table S3). However, the significance
levels are all less than the 97 genes identified by NCC—AUC. For ex—
ample, this 50 gene set overlaps with SMID_BREAST_CANCER
_BASAL_UP by 12 genes with a q—value 1.11E—08. Moreover, we
investigated the genes which were uniquely identified by NCC—AUC
in basal—like subtype. We found that more than half of these genes
are not contained in L1—Cox model and SVM—RFE (Fig. 5C). By
checking the functional annotation, half of these genes are contained
in top 10 gene sets by GSEA from the 97 genes identified by NCC—
AUC.

To look at the consistency, we compared prognosis result by
NCC—AUC in validation cohort in all subtypes. We found that

normal—like subtype shows the best result, followed by lunminalA,
luminalB, basal-like, Her2—i—. Apart from Her2—i—, the order of other
four subtypes are consistent with two studies for the same dataset
(Jerby—Arnon et al., 2014; Liu et al., 2014). Except for normal-like
subtype, the validation AUC of the other four subtypes are low,
which further confers the limitation of gene expression data in
breast cancer prognosis prediction. In addition, we also found that
more than half of the genes selected by SVM—RFE are consistent
with NCC—AUC in basal—like subtype (Fig. 5C). Taken together,
NCC—AUC selects biologically meaningful genes, which are consist—
ent with other research in basal—like subtype.

3.2 Performance in clinical data of lung cancer

3.2.1 Multi-biomarker panel identified by NCC-AUC

in clinical data

In addition to genomic data, we further tested NCC—AUC in clinical
data for multiple—biomarker panel identification. The training co-
hort contains 42 positive samples and 58 negative samples, and val—
idation cohort contains 20 positive samples and 28 negative
samples. NCC—AUC selects a panel of 12 biomarkers with
AUC:0.8284 in training cohort and AUC:0.7589 in validation
cohort by setting 220.013 (Fig. 6). The panel consists of p21ras,
NM23-H1, CD34-MVD, BAX, CD44v6, EMA, CEA, cyclin-D1,
p27kip1, VEGF, cancer—cell type and PCNA. p21ras is an oncogene
and has been reported as an independent predictors of prognosis for
NSCLC (Gessner, 1998; Kim et al., 1998). Besides, NM23—H1 in-
creases CD34—MVD’s expression and VEGF and may be associated
with NSCLC metastasis (Che et al., 2005 ). BAX has important regu—
latory roles in apoptosis and is associated with early stage NSCLC
(Krajewski et al., 1994; Milas et al., 2003). In addition, CD44v6 is
related to CEA and EMA and may play role in differenti-
ation and progression of NSCLC (Nguyen et al., 1999). These bio—
markers combine together to form a panel to assist survival time
prediction.

3.2.2 NCC-AUC outperforms SVM and SVM-RFE in clinical data
Compared with NCC—AUC, SVM gets AUC: 0.9020 and
AUC: 0.4786 in training and validation cohort respectively
(Fig. 6). It shows that NCC—AUC successfully avoids overfitting by
selecting a panel of biomarkers to de—noise. SVM—RFE identifies a
panel of 8 biomarkers with performance of AUC : 0.8173 in train—
ing cohort and AUC: 0.5037 in validation cohort (Fig. 6). NCC—
AUC is better with training AUC: 0.8284 and validation
AUC : 0.7589. Those comparison shows that NCC—AUC possesses
advantage in feature selection and performs better than SVM—RFE
in both training and validation cohorts of clinical data.

3.2.3 NCC-AUC outperforms Cox model and L1-Cox model in
clinical data

To investigate the survival analysis by NCC—AUC, we selected a cut—
off score similar as before and then classified training and validation
cohort into two groups. The training cohort contains 55 predicted
low risk and 45 predicted high risk patients. Similarly, the validation
cohort contains 25 predicted low risk and 23 predicted high risk pa-
tients. Log—rank test shows P—value < 0.00001 in training cohort and
P—value:0.0158 in validation cohort (Fig. 7A, 7B). Compared to
NCC—AUC, Cox model shows significance in training cohort (P-
value < 0.00001) while non-significance in validation cohort
(P—value : 0.5939) (Fig. 7C, 7D). With feature selection strategy,
L1—Cox model identifies a panel of 17 biomarkers with P-
value < 0.00001 in training cohort and 0.7166 in validation cohort

verting survival time prediction to a classification problem with
evaluating AUC accuracy significantly improves patient survival pre—
diction and achieves better performance than classical survival
models.

4 Discussion and conclusion

Selecting multi—biomarker panel in cancer survival analysis is a chal—
lenging task because of the complexity of cancer pathogenesis and
the difficulty of estimating the time until event occurs. Cox model is
a classical model and widely used in survival analysis and L1—Cox
model could select a panel of features for survival risk ratio estima—
tion. However, the quality of survival time is very crucial for Cox

model and L1—Cox model. Inspired by the fact that CI is a good
measure for survival estimation, we aim to optimize CI directly.
Noticing that AUC is a good approximation for CI, we treat the
problem as a classification problem. This key idea allows us to pro—
pose NCC—AUC to identify meaningful biomarkers for survival ana-
lysis. NCC—AUC optimizes AUC and the number of biomarkers
simultaneously thus we could select a multi—biomarker panel that
has more powerful prognosis—predicting ability.

We demonstrated the good performance of NCC—AUC on not
only gene expression profiles of breast cancer but also clinical data
of Stage IB NSCLC. We observed that the multi—biomarker panel
identified by NCC—AUC is more plausible in biology. For example,
in basal—like subtype NCC—AUC identifies 97 genes and GSEA anno—
tation shows that these genes were closely related with this subtype
(Supplementary Table S1). Furthermore, these genes also show
lower average redundancy than L1—Cox model and SVM-RFE. This
further demonstrates NCC—AUC’s ability to remove redundant fea—
tures. In addition, NCC—AUC shows robust performance gain across
tumor subtypes and training cohort sampling, and it also shows con—
sistent improvement than SVM, SVM—RFE, Cox model and L1—Cox
model at different thresholds. Finally, we validated NCC—AUC in
clinical data and NCC—AUC selects the biomarkers closely associ—
ated with stage IB NSCLC. Thus NCC—AUC holds the promise to
identify plausible multi—biomarker panel to assist survival analysis.

Our results show that the binary classification framework works
well in real survival data analysis. The comparisons with traditional
survival analysis, such as Cox model and L1—Cox model, clearly dem—
onstrate this point. Unlike Cox model, NCC—AUC converts survival
time prediction to a classification problem and evaluates classification
by AUC. Here AUC is a good approximation of CI which is a classical
index in survival analysis. Importantly NCC—AUC performs better
than Cox model and L1—Cox model in validation cohort for both gene
expression dataset and clinical dataset (Supplemental Tables 85, S6).
Therefore, we have a good reason to believe that NCC—AUC is a use—
ful tool for survival analysis. Especially when the survival data is
noisy, NCC—AUC can be more useful to ignore the detailed values.

Further comparison with existing feature selection method
SVM—RFE reveals the advantage of NCC—AUC in feature selection.
Unlike SVM—RFE’s stepwise way to eliminate one feature in each
step, NCC—AUC allows us to select the best feature combination by
solving a single optimization model. We showed that NCC—AUC is
better than SVM—RFE in both datasets (Supplemental Tables 85,
S6). In addition, we maximize AUC to improve the classification
accuracy instead of classification error with a specified cutoff in
SVM—RFE. Furthermore, NCC—AUC is formulated as a linear
programming and could be solved rapidly and effectively.

We acknowledge that our current NCC—AUC is limited in several
ways, which suggests future improvements. On one hand, NCC—
AUC is limited in identifying much biological insights. NCC—AUC
directly selects the molecular signatures for the samples with differ-
ent phenotypes (whether a patient survive more than 5 years) while
a posteriori justification may happen from molecular level to pheno—
type level then the ambiguous molecular signature may be useless.
(Piao et al., 2011) proposed a method to reduce the justification,
which may help to solve the problem. In addition, two improve—
ments may enhance the biological insights in the future work. One is
that we should integrate the pathway information into NCC—AUC
and then we will identify the network biomarker with good inter—
pretability; the other is that, we should also take the values of sur—
vival time into account rather than only take a threshold. We tried
to maximize the sum of PCCs of the selected features and survival
time, which shows no significant improvement (P—value:0.9186,

Student’s t—test) (Supplementary Fig. S4) in the basal—like subtype.
But it integrates more information and may have a significant im-
provement in other cases. NCC—AUC is also limited in model con—
struction. We classify patients by assessing whether the patient’s
survival time is longer than 5 years. We assume that the two classes
are stable and have its own centroid distribution, which allows us to
design simple nearest centroid based classifier. Besides, NCC—AUC
failed to consider some patients with censored survival time. This ig-
nores the information from censored patients with survival time less
than five years. In addition, NCC—AUC is based on linear classifier
and we should seek other nonlinear classification methods. Finally,
AUC is only a good measure of CI and we should consider to opti—
mize CI directly in future.

In conclusion, we convert the survival time regression problem
to a classification problem motivated by optimizing CI. In practice,
we evaluate classification accuracy by AUC and propose a novel op—
timization model to maximize it. Our main contribution is to simul—
taneously optimize two objectives: AUC and the number of selected
features. We slack AUC by a loss function and the number of fea—
tures by L1 ‘norm’ and solve the problem via a linear programming.
We applied NCC—AUC to gene expression profiles of breast cancer
and stage IB NSCLC. The results fully demonstrate the advantages
of NCC—AUC by outperforming SVM, SVM—RFE, Cox model and
L1—Cox model. Our novel method holds the promise to predict the
reliable prognosis of breast cancer and stage IB NSCLC. We also
note that our new method can be widely extended in analyzing can-
cer genomics data and studying other complex diseases.

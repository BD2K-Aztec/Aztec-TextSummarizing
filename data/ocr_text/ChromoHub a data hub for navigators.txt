ABSTRACT

Summary: The rapidly increasing research activity focused
on chromatin-mediated regulation of epigenetic mechanisms is
generating waves of data on writers, readers and erasers of the
histone code, such as protein methyltransferases, bromodomains
or histone deacetylases. To make these data easily accessible to
communities of research scientists coming from diverse horizons,
we have created ChromoHub, an online resource where users can
map on phylogenetic trees disease associations, protein structures,
chemical inhibitors, histone substrates, chromosomal aberrations
and other types of data extracted from public repositories and
the published literature. The interface can be used to define the
structural or chemical coverage of a protein family, highlight domain
architectures, interrogate disease relevance or zoom in on specific
genes for more detailed information. This open-access resource
should serve as a hub for cell biologists, medicinal chemists,
structural biologists and other navigators that explore the biology
of chromatin signalling.

1 INTRODUCTION

Chromatin-mediated control of gene expression and cell fate is
regulated in part by distinct combinations of post-translational
modiﬁcations on histone proteins, predominantly methylation or
acetylation of lysine or arginine side chains at the N-terminal tails of
histones (Fierz and Muir, 2012; Kouzarides, 2007; Strahl and Allis,
2000). Alteration of this histone code can lead to diseases states, and
chemical inhibition of proteins that write, read or erase histone marks
represents a promising avenue to restore to normal level disease-
associated gene expression (Arrowsmith et al., 2012). Following the
clinical validation of this strategy with histone deacetylase (HDAC)
inhibitors (Prince et al., 2009), writers, readers and erasers of histone
marks constitute emerging therapeutic target classes for a variety of

disease conditions. Consequently, a dramatic increase in research
activity has been observed in the ﬁeld. The rapidly growing body of
heterogeneous data generated by diverse communities of scientists
is in part accessible through public repositories or the published
literature. But retrieving the data is time-consuming at best for the
non-specialist: will a cell biologist know where to ﬁnd what small
molecule inhibitors are available for his protein of interest, and
what their IC50’s are? Will a medicinal chemist easily retrieve all
compounds co-crystallized with her protein target? Will a biochemist
know which somatic aberration, buried in vast cancer genomics
databases, is linked to the protein he is characterizing?

We have built a database that integrates such heterogeneous
data types extracted from multiple repositories and the published
literature. A simple yet powerful web interface allows research
scientists coming from diverse horizons who are interested in
writers, readers and erasers of the histone code to interrogate
this database through phylogenetic representations of each protein
family. The interface is freely available and should promote cross-
pollination between diverse communities of scientists interested in
epigenetic signalling.

2 METHODS

2.1 Assembling protein families

Human protein families were deﬁned by the presence of speciﬁc domains
involved in writing, reading and erasing histone marks (Arrowsmith et al.,
2012; Kouzarides, 2007): protein methyltransferase (PMT) and histone
acetyltransferase (HAT) domains for writers, lysine demethylase (KDM)
and HDAC domains for erasers and bromodomains (BRD) for readers of
acetylated lysines. Different domains are known to bind methyl-lysines
(Tudor, MBT, Chromo, PWWP, PHD and BAH), and each deﬁned a
subfamily of its own (Kuo et al., 2012; Taverna et al., 2007). The human
protein reference database (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009), the PFAM (Punta
et al., 2012) and SMART databases (Schultz et al., 2000) were queried to
retrieve all human genes containing at least one of these domains. Duplicates
were removed and missing genes clearly documented in the published
literature were added manually.

2.2 Generating phylogenetic trees

For each protein family, two phylogenetic trees were produced. The ﬁrst was
based on a ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007) multiple sequence alignment of the
default UniProt protein variant of each human gene. The second was based
on a multiple sequence alignment of the domain after which the family was
named (a domain-based tree was not generated for HATs as the catalytic
domain is not always clearly deﬁned for this family). In this case, a seed

sequence alignment was derived from available protein structures by aligning
residues that were superimposed in the three-dimensional space in ICM
(Molsoft, San Diego). Additional sequences were appended by aligning them
to the closest seed sequence in ICM. A PHP script plotted a phylogenetic tree
from the Newick string of the multiple sequence alignment and automatically
deﬁned X ,Y coordinates next to each leaf of the tree for metadata mapping
(Supplementary Methods). We veriﬁed that this methodology produced a
phylogeny in agreement with trees previously published in the literature
(Filippakopoulos et al., 2012; Richon et al., 2011). A larger version of
the PMT family was reported that includes numerous putative arginine
methyltransferases; these were not included as the authors of that work
stated that they did not want to imply that these proteins are protein arginine
methyltransferases per se (Richon et al., 2011).

2.3 Metadata source

Data related to the biology, structural and chemical coverage of each
gene were extracted from diverse repositories and stored in MySQL.
Function summary, sub-cellular location and polymorphisms were retrieved
from UniProt records. Tissue expression data were collected from
the GNF’s BioGPS (Wu et al., 2009). Cancer-associated chromosomal
aberrations were extracted from the Mitelman database (http://cgap.nci.nih.
gov/Chromosomes/Mitelman) and the Sanger Institute’s cancer gene census
(http://www.sanger.ac.uk/genetics/CGP/Censusl). Protein interactions were
from the String database (Szklarczyk et al., 2011). Structural coverage
was produced by querying the Protein Databank (http://www.rcsb.org/pdb)
with Blast. Protein domain architecture was deﬁned by querying the PFAM
database with HMMER (e-value cutoff of 0.01) (Sonnhammer et al., 1998).
NIH funding was extracted from NIH’s RePORT (http://projectreporternih.
gov/reporter.cfm) and published literature from Pubmed. NCBI’s built-in
links between Pubmed records and genes were used to retrieve articles
associated to human, mouse or rat orthologues of the gene of interest,
and keywords embedded in Pubmed’s MeSH terms served to associate
Pubmed records with diseases. Histone substrates and chemical inhibitors
were manually extracted from the literature and all records were linked to
their respective Pubmed or patent reference. All chemical inhibitors from
Bindinng can also be mapped on the trees (Liu et al., 2007). Pubmed
records, disease association, funding and structure coverage are updated
automatically on a weekly basis. Other data are updated manually.

3 RESULTS

The online user interface is based on phylogenetic representations
of protein families involved in writing, reading and erasing
histone post-translational modiﬁcations. Users can choose between
phylogenetic classiﬁcation derived from multiple alignments of full—
length sequences or sequences of the domain after which the family
was named. Thumbnails of phylogenetic trees for each protein
family can be clicked to display larger images. Once a tree is
selected, the sequence alignment used to generate the tree can be
downloaded. Checkboxes can be selected to map a diverse array of
data on the tree of interest. Information on the data source is provided
in a window that pops-up when hovering over a [i] icon next to
the checkbox. Once a checkbox is selected, associated symbols
are shown next to each protein for which data is available. More
information is then accessible by hovering over or clicking on the
symbol of interest.

Users can easily navigate the functional, structural and chemical
landscape of each protein family. They can display functional
summaries for each gene on the trees, list structures in the
Protein Databank covering each gene and map them on linear
representations of the protein where PFAM domains are highlighted,

display small molecule co-crystallized with any protein or retrieve
chemical inhibitors reported in the published or patent literature;
they can see the number of entries in Pubmed for each gene and
inspect disease associations automatically inferred from Pubmed
records; users can easily access chromosomal aberrations linked
to cancer, tissue expression data, sub-cellular location or histone
substrates. Images can be saved on the desktop and embedded
in presentations. Newcomers in the ﬁeld can search for potential
collaborators by looking for research laboratories with active
funding on their gene of interest.

4 CONCLUSION

The explosion of research activity on epigenetic signalling and
recent technological breakthroughs in genome-scale biology are
providing a wealth of data related to writers, readers and erasers
of histone marks. The open-access resource that we have developed
should help research scientists involved in chromatin biology rapidly
ﬁnd data that inform their research.

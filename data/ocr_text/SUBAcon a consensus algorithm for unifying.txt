ABSTRACT

Motivation: Knowing the subcellular location of proteins is critical for
understanding their function and developing accurate networks repre-
senting eukaryotic biological processes. Many computational tools
have been developed to predict proteome-wide subcellular location,
and abundant experimental data from green fluorescent protein (GFP)
tagging or mass spectrometry (MS) are available in the model plant,
Arabidopsis. None of these approaches is error-free, and thus, results
are often contradictory.

Results: To help unify these multiple data sources, we have de-
veloped the SUBcellular Arabidopsis consensus (SUBAcon) algorithm,
a naive Bayes classifier that integrates 22 computational prediction
algorithms, experimental GFP and MS localizations, protein—protein
interaction and co-expression data to derive a consensus call and
probability. SUBAcon classifies protein location in Arabidopsis more
accurately than single predictors.

Availability: SUBAcon is a useful tool for recovering proteome-
wide subcellular locations of Arabidopsis proteins and is displayed
in the SUBA3 database (http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au). The
source code and input data is available through the SUBA3 server
(http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au//SUBAcon.html) and the
Arabidopsis Sprroteome REference (ASURE) training set can be ac-
cessed using the ASURE web portal (http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.
edu.au/ASURE).

1 INTRODUCTION

Owing to the tight relationship between subcellular compart-
ments and protein function, proteome-wide protein localization
is an important goal in cell biology. Direct identification of pro-
teins in subcellular compartments via mass spectrometry (MS)
remains the most popular large-scale approach in crude and
compartment-enriched samples (Joshi et al., 2011). However,
despite signiﬁcant technological progress, experimental data are
not error-free contributing to overlapping or contradicting
datasets (Ehnore et al., 2012; Ito et al., 2011; Nikolovski et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2012; Sakamoto and Takagi, 2013). The green ﬂuorescent pro-
tein (GFP)-tagged protein approach is generally more accurate,
but labor- and time-intensive, resulting in small study sizes with
only a few high-throughput studies (Boruc et al., 2010; Dunkley
et al., 2006; Lee et al., 2011). Though the low coverage makes
GFP insufﬁcient as a stand-alone dataset for proteome-wide
localization, this methodology remains one of the most widely
accepted by biologists. With the help of manual curation from
the literature, previously scattered MS and GFP data for
Arabidopsis can now be found aggregated in locations
including SUBA3 (Tanz et al., 2013), UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot
(Schneider et al., 2009; TheUniProtConsortium, 2011) and
TAIR (Lamesch et al., 2012). These aggregated data present
a valuable resource for accessing large-scale protein localization
datasets.

Association data such as protein—protein interaction (PPI) and
transcript co-expression analyses help assess the proteome in
terms of functional clusters. Given that proteins in functional
pathways tend to more often co-locate than not, these data
contain indirect experimental evidence for location. Both
co-expression and PPI-associated protein sets are enriched for
same-location protein groups (Geisler-Lee et al., 2007; Huh
et al., 2003), and PPI data have been suggested previously to
be resources for predicting subcellular location of proteins in
multiple eukaryotic species (Jiang and Wu, 2012; Shin et al.,
2009). Less is known about the value of co-expression data
for predicting co-location, despite the widespread use of
co-expression networks to infer shared function (Stuart et al.,
2003). These voluminous expression datasets have remained
a relatively untapped data resource for subcellular location
prediction.

Many proteome-wide subcellular location predictors have
been developed based on sequence properties (Chou and Shen,
2010; Shen et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2010). Various machine learn-
ing and pattern recognition approaches have proved popular for
this purpose (Chou and Shen, 2007), including support vector
machines (SVM) (Hua and Sun, 2001), k-nearest neighbor
(KNN) (Horton et al., 2007), neural networks (Small et al.,
2004) and hidden Markov models (Lin et al., 2011). Each
bears individual advantages and shortcomings in terms of the
number of required features, the danger of over-fitting and
the ability to handle multiple optima. Single machine learning
approaches (Blum et al., 2009) can be stacked into dual algo-
rithms (Petsalaki et al., 2006; Pierleoni et al., 2006), which have

SUBAcon - Arabidopsis subcellular protein location consensus

 

shown some improvements in accuracy. The majority of
predictors derive subcellular location using protein sequence fea-
tures, associated properties and/or Gene Ontology (Shen et al.,
2007) and curator annotations (Briesemeister et al., 2010).
Sequence-based predictors attempt to identify sequence patterns
in the primary protein sequence that target proteins to individual
organelles (Blum et al., 2009; Claros and Vincens, 1996; Zybailov
et al., 2008). Distinct machine-learning algorithms often yield
different results from similar or identical inputs with surprisingly
poor overlap (Tanz and Small, 2011). The often incongruent
results from predictors are probably the main reason why experi-
mental data remain the gold standard for most biologists, despite
the unresolved difﬁculties associated with the experimental
approaches (Millar et al., 2009).

Given the lack of a single best method for inferring subcellular
location, concepts that use all available knowledge about pro-
teins are attractive approaches for forming a consensus view.
Integrating varied data sources has been used in yeast mitochon-
drial studies, where this approach revealed promising new
insights into genes involved in mitochondrial functions
(Prokisch et al., 2004). In Arabidopsis, various resources for
interrogating aggregate location information exist (Heazlewood
et al., 2007; Joshi et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2009; Tanz et al., 2013).
In general, none of these plant databases addresses the challenge
of unifying the data for large-scale single location calls, including
conﬁdence values.

Previously, we reported on database extensions within the
SUBA3 database, including the mention of an initial version of
the SUBcellular Arabidopsis consensus (SUBAcon) algorithm
that integrates GFP and MS data together with computational
predictors (Tanz et al., 2013). Here, we fully describe the devel-
opment of the Bayesian classiﬁer SUBAcon that uses aggregated
computational predictor outputs, direct MS, GFP localizations
and now also indirect PPI and co-expression data to produce
consensus calls for subcellular locations of Arabidopsis proteins.
Additionally, we then analyze the SUBAcon calls to assess their
usability for biologists. We found that SUBAcon increased sub-
cellular localization classiﬁcation accuracy and offers localization
probability values that enable the user to interpret conﬂicting
observations and predictions as well as extract consensus loca-
tion datasets for large-scale protein sets for further use.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The non-redundant Arabidopsis proteome, subcellular location predictor
outputs and experimentally determined subcellular locations were ob-
tained from SUBA3 (Tanz et al., 2013). Subcellular locations were as-
signed to the 10 categories: cytosol, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular,
Golgi, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxisome, plastid, plasma membrane
and vacuole. The subcellular category ‘cytoskeleton’ was included in the
category ‘cytosol’. PPI datasets of 24 336 protein pairs were obtained
from the IntAct database (Kerrien et al., 2012) and SUBA3 (Tanz
et al., 2013). Co-expression datasets were obtained from ATTEDII ver-
sion 6.1 (http://atted.jp). For each co-expressed gene pair (AGI_A,
AGI_B), the mutual rank (MR), which is the geometric mean between
the two ranks (AGI_A => AGI_B; AGI_B => AGI_A) restricted to
MR< 300 and the Pearson’s product-momentum correlation coefﬁcient

(PCC) were obtained (Obayashi et al., 2009). The dataset contained
7 503 932 gene pairs derived from 26459 distinct loci.

2.2 Generation of the Arabidopsis Sprroteome
REference

A curated Arabidopsis Sprroteome REference (ASURE) dataset was
established using Arabidopsis proteins whose subcellular location can be
conﬁdently inferred from their known functions as catalogued by TAIR
(Lamesch et al., 2012). In the absence of any functional data from
Arabidopsis, evidence from other species was used. ASURE offers trans-
parent choices of reference proteins and locations by a community of
curators and is being updated frequently. We invite scientists working
on Arabidopsis to submit new entries or curate existing proteins to im-
prove training set accuracy. More detailed information about curatorship
and protein inclusion criteria are available through the Web server
(http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/ASURE). ASURE currently con-
sists of 5325 (including 400 multi-targeted proteins) of which 997,
balanced across all 10 compartments, were individually manually curated
according to the above criteria. The ASURE standard is openly accessible
through the above browse, download and curation portal.

2.3 Location categories and primary workflow

The prior proportions of each subcellular proteome used for SUBAcon
training were taken from the calculated distribution of the non-redundant
proteome in animal and yeast cells (Guda, 2010) and the estimated size of
the plastid proteome in plant cells (Huang et al., 2013; Kleffmann et al.,
2004; Martin et al., 2002). These proportions were 15.5% cytosol, 3.1%
endoplasmic reticulum, 10.3% extracellular, 1.0% Golgi, 6.3% mito-
chondrion, 30.0% nucleus, 1.4% peroxisome, 16.5% plasma membrane,
12.6% plastid and 3.1% vacuole.

SUBAcon was developed in two phases. Phase 1 classiﬁed proteins
into the location categories cytosol, mitochondrion, nucleus, peroxi-
some, plastid or secretory. The aggregate location ‘secretory’ included
the locations Golgi, endoplasmic reticulum, extracellular, plasma mem-
brane and vacuole. Proteins within the phase 1 secretory location were
classiﬁed into further individual locations during phase 2. Subcellular
targeting predictions for ASURE proteins were performed using 22
different available subcellular prediction programs (Supplementary
Table S1). Subcellular locations from experimental data from SUBA3
(GFP and MS data) were treated as ‘predictions’ for the development of
SUBAcon, and multiple locations were weighted based on the number
of times each location has been reported. Multilocation outputs derived
from ATP and Plant-mPLoc were treated as a separate output feature.
The category ‘unknown’ indicates when no subcellular location output
was available. In the primary input table, each row refers to a single
protein from ASURE, each column refers to a predictor and the last
column to the ASURE location (Supplementary Table S2). Phase 1
included 5325 proteins and 26 components (22 predictors and 4 experi-
mental components); phase 2 included 1200 proteins and 10
components.

2.4 Generating frequency input tables

For each predictor and a given subcellular ASURE subset (e.g. all pro-
teins of the cytosol), we computed the frequency of each location occur-
ring in the primary input table. Mathematically, these frequencies are
deﬁned as:

floc _ nifX +05

l—>>l<

where:

1113: X is number of times predictor-i predicts location X when true
location is loo.

0: is the Laplace correction—usually 1.

K,- is the number of features output by predictor-i.

N12,, is the total number of proteins predicted by predictor-i for which
the ASURE gold standard gives location: Ice.

The Laplace correction was used to avoid low counts that have no bio-
logical relevance. If the number of prediction counts and total number of
predicted proteins goes toward zero, the frequency estimate returns to its
‘uniform’ value 1/K where K is the number of possible outcomes for a
given predictor. The calculated frequencies were arranged in six frequency
input tables for phase 1 and ﬁve input tables for phase 2 according to the
ASURE location categories. An example for the location mitochondrion
is given in Supplementary Table S3. Blank cells represent locations not
predicted by the particular predictor. Each input source (22 predictors, 4
experimental) offered seven (phase 1) or ten (phase 2) features to compare
with the known location in ASURE (e.g. mitochondrion).

3 ALGORITHM

For the naive Bayes model for probability estimation, the
‘frequency signatures’ were used as input to a naive Bayes
model with the goal of matching characteristic signatures to a
particular subcellular location. Mathematically, the probability
estimation was calculated as

P(protein —>loc|p1—> X1,p2 —> X2, ...,p26 —> X26)

26

where:

p,- are the 26 predictors: 22 computational and 4
experimental.

X ,- are the locations they predict for this protein, e.g.
cytosol.

l.in the frequencies that this prediction X ,- occurs when

the gold standard say ‘100’ for this predictor i.
Pp,,0,(loc) the prior probability that a (any) protein is targeted
to this location

The two factors that constrained the probability calculation
were the Laplace correction (a) and the prior probabilities of
proteins to be found in a particular subcellular compartment
(Pprior). Variation of at indicated that a = l was optimal. To
validate the SUBAcon classiﬁcation model, we used the jack-
knife method. For validation, contingency tables were generated
and used to calculate frequencies of true- and false-positive
results as well as true- and false-negative results. To estimate
the overall performance of SUBAcon, the mutual information
(MI) as a direct function of this contingency table was
calculated as:

 

fij
ﬁjln ’
 (mam/k.)

where f deﬁnes the frequency of the feature matching counts
divided by the total counts i.e. frequencies. For each compart-
ment, the Matthews correlation coefﬁcients (MCCs) were

calculated as the square root of the MI computation approxi-
mated as a X2 function and applied to the 2 x 2 true, false posi-
tive and negative contingency using:

TP x TN — FP x FN
\/(TP+FP)(TP+FN)(TN+ FP)(TN+FN)

 

 

SUBAcon generates a matrix of probabilities for each protein
and each subcellular location (Supplementary Table S4). In the
ﬁnal output, the probability of the secretory location from phase
1 was multiplied with the probability of the secretory sublocation
from phase 2 to provide the correct probabilities for all 10 loca-
tions. These probabilities can be found in the SUBA3 ﬁatﬁle for
each protein when scrolling over the subcellular location in the
cell cartoon (e. g. http://suba.p1antenergy.uwa.edu.au/ﬁatﬁ1e.
php?id =AT5G36290.1). To generate the ﬁnal location call, the
location with the highest probability (P) was chosen for each
protein. If this location had a calculated P>0.5, the protein
was classiﬁed as single-targeted to this location. When the prob-
ability was smaller (P<0.5), proteins were classiﬁed as multi-
targeted and the next most likely location was added to the
consensus call until the sum of probabilities from all included
locations reached P>0.5.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

4.1 The Arabidopsis Sprroteome REference is a
balanced proteome standard suitable for training

The development of a global subcellular classiﬁcation algorithm
requires a balanced reference standard for training and testing.
The ASURE was generated as described above and contains at
least 10% of each estimated subcellular proteome for phase 1
locations and at least 5% of each secretory compartment in
phase 2. Because experimental (GFP, MS) data were introduced
in the classiﬁcation algorithm, the assembly of ASURE prote-
omes avoided the use of experimental localization unlike previ-
ously reported organellar reference sets (Ito et al., 2011; Millar
et al., 2006; Parsons et al., 2012). To minimize circular reasoning,
the inclusion criteria for curated ASURE proteins were instead
based on protein function (see Methods).

The number of proteins per compartment in ASURE was
balanced to range within :l:2% of the proposed relative occur-
rences of whole subcellular proteomes (Guda, 2010) with slightly
more nuclear proteins and less plasma membrane proteins
(Supplementary Fig. S1). ASURE contains 251 multi-targeted
proteins (4.7%), slightly lower than is estimated overall in eu-
karyotic proteomes (King and Guda, 2007). The deviation from
prior proportions of the subcellular proteomes (Supplementary
Fig. S2) as well as reducing ASURE size to 2000 proteins (data
not shown) had little impact on classiﬁcation performance as
tested by the jackknife method. Therefore, the current size of
ASURE is sufﬁciently large to achieve reliable classiﬁcations
and possible differences between estimated and actual compart-
mental proteome sizes in Arabidopsis are unlikely to distort our
results.

We compared ASURE with the peer-reviewed reference set
used for training the classiﬁers MultiLoc2 (Blum et al., 2009),
EpiLoc (Brady and Shatkay, 2008) and YLoc (Briesemeister

SUBAcon - Arabidopsis subcellular protein location consensus

 

et al., 2010). This reference proteome dataset contains 5959
SWISSprot-derived eukaryotic proteins and their subcellular an-
notations of which 769 were Arabidopsis proteins with a similar
subcellular distribution to ASURE. The overlap of the reference
proteins and ASURE proteins included 377 proteins. Only one
protein was assigned to a different location. Sufﬁcient data
justiﬁed its location as annotated in ASURE (Supplementary
Table S5).

ASURE contains 2582 proteins (48.5%) that have been inde-
pendently experimentally localized (Supplementary Fig. SlB).
Of the ASURE proteins with experimental data, 87% of proteins
had at least one reported experimental location that matched the
location assigned in ASURE. This implied a combined error
rate of 13% in the experimental locations and the ASURE
assignments. We obtained a high-conﬁdence Arabidopsis plastid
proteome reference that has been generated using orthologous
relationships with maize, manually removing suspected contam-
ination in multiple MS datasets and cross-referencing GFP
fusion validation (Huang et al., 2013). This dataset contained
1559 Arabidopsis plastid proteins, of which 550 proteins are
also contained in ASURE. Less than 0.5% of proteins were as-
signed to an alternate location by MS (Supplementary Table S5),
indicating that manual curation of experimental data as well as
ASURE using several sources creates high-conﬁdence reference
sets. Overall, the discrepancy between ASURE and independent
curated experimental and annotated reference standards was
<l%. This showed that ASURE was sufﬁciently accurate for
use as a reference proteome in this study.

4.2 Integrating multiple computational prediction and
classiﬁcation algorithms determines protein location
more accurately than single predictors

Individual predictors exhibit strengths and weaknesses, and their
discrepancies are considerable. For uniﬁcation of a number of
multi- and single compartment predictor outputs and generating
an overall estimation of subcellular location, we integrated 22
selected computational predictors into a two-phase naive Bayes
classiﬁer (Fig. 1A). To test for independence of input variables,
we assessed the predictor data channels (22 predictors contain 73
data channels) for partial correlations (Supplementary Fig. S3).
Analysis showed that maximally 5—10 channels could be con-
sidered dependent and that removal of these channels did not
change the classiﬁcation outcome. This suggests that the 22 com-
putational predictors generate independent predictions by means
of distinct computational methods despite using similar input
variables.

The variance between ASURE location and the location
output from the naive Bayes classiﬁer was evaluated by the jack-
knife resampling. The naive Bayes algorithm produced probabil-
ities for each protein and each compartment that can be used as
a conﬁdence measure for subcellular localization. Hereafter, one
location call is displayed per protein with a single location for
high probabilities (P(x) > 0.5) or a multilocation call for accumu-
lated multiple lower probabilities (2P(X)>0.5). The integration
of the 22 predictors equaled or surpassed the classiﬁcation
accuracy for most compartments in comparison with single
predictors (Table 1, Supplementary Table S6).

4.3 Including experimentally determined locations
from proteomics and GFP tagging data improves
classiﬁcation performance

According to SUBA3, 9321 distinct Arabidopsis proteins have
at least one direct experimentally determined location (Fig. 1B)
covering 26.3% of the proteome. Because of the labor-intensive
nature of the GFP methodology, the proteome coverage with
4110 independent GFP localizations of 2647 proteins (~7.5%)
was relatively low. In contrast, SUBA3 MS data at time of writ-
ing contain 24142 localizations for 7892 proteins and covers
~22% of the Arabidopsis proteome. Similarly to the GFP
data, MS data were weighted by the number of independent
localizations per protein but also weighted by the number
of MS studies per compartment to account for the variable
number of studies available for each compartment
(Supplementary Table S7). The weighing of individual experi-
mentation adjusted the inﬂuence of experimental data when
more than one study was available, as they were independent
data points contributing to the evidence base. The weighing of
observed proteins in organellar separation experimentation
avoids over- and underestimation of experimental data owing
to the uneven study distribution targeting certain organelles.
Both, MS and GFP data signiﬁcantly improved classiﬁcation
performance as shown by MI (Supplementary Fig. S4A).

Comparing GFP and MS in terms of data agreement, a higher
proportion of GFP localizations (~78%) agreed with the
ASURE locations in comparison with the MS dataset (~65%),
indicating that MS data included greater error rates. As might be
expected, the proportion of location mismatches in experimental
data was compartment-speciﬁc (Supplementary Table S8).
Subcellular localization data of proteins with more than one
experimental localization showed a high rate of discrepancy.

4.4 Integration of PPIs improves classiﬁcation of
cytosolic, endoplasmic reticulum and plasma
membrane proteins

We have shown in the past that proteins predicted to interact are
likely to both co-localize and derive from co-expressed genes
(Geisler-Lee et al., 2007). Thus, knowing the location of inter-
acting and co-expressed proteins provides a valuable source of
information. For integration into SUBAcon, the PPI partners
of a query protein were required to be within ASURE, and the
location of the PPI partner was used as an indication of location
of the test protein. The PPI experimental data covered 1474 pro-
teins additional to GFP and MS data of which 670 proteins were
also not covered by co-expression data. Of all PPI protein pairs
within ASURE, >75% were found in the same compartment,
and ~9% were found in adjacent compartments (Supplementary
Fig. S5A). These PPIs represent biologically feasible physical
interaction partners. The remaining 15% were neither matching
nor adjacent, which may include proteins that relocate to interact
(e.g. signaling) and false positive PPIs that are biochemically
possible but do not occur physiologically due to spatial separ-
ation in the cell. Assessment of PPI combinations in each
compartment showed that interaction frequency within the
same compartment was compartment-speciﬁc (Supplementary
Table S9).

The integration of PPI data into SUBAcon extended the ex-
perimental coverage from 26% to 33% (Supplementary Fig. S4).
Despite the small additive contribution to the overall prediction
power of SUBAcon, the PPI data were a valuable contribution
to particular compartments, including the plasma membrane,
cytosol and endoplasmic reticulum (Supplementary Fig. S4C).
Some of the latter compartments are challenging to predict
by single computational algorithms, and their protein comple-
ments are often contaminants in MS preparations of other
compartments.

4.5 Integration of co-expression associations increases
the coverage of the experimental data

For retrieving meaningful relationships, the co-expressed
gene pairs within ASURE were assessed for their
compartment-speciﬁc co-expression strength using MR and cor-
relation strength by PCC in relation to classiﬁcation performance
(by MCC). Analysis of variable MR thresholds at the ﬁxed PCC
threshold of >0.5 showed the greatest loss of coverage when
decreasing the MR threshold below 40 and greatest loss of MI
when increasing the MR above 50 (Supplementary Fig. S5B). As
a compromise between coverage and classiﬁcation performance,
the cut-off was set to MR <50, comparable with previous studies
(Kourmpetis et al., 2011). Analysis of correlation strength by
PCC and classiﬁcation performance by MCC indicated that cor-
relation strength is compartment—speciﬁc (Supplementary Table
S10). However, most proteins encoded by co-expressed genes
were localized within the same compartment independent of
average compartmental correlation strength (Supplementary
Table S1 1). The PCC threshold for SUBAcon training was
chosen for each compartment at the point of the highest possible
MCC value while preserving coverage (Supplementary Fig. S5C).
Overall, 12533 proteins could be linked to a co-expressed gene
encoding a protein in ASURE. Of this set, 6565 proteins did not
have any alternative experimental localization data. The inclu-
sion of co-expression data increased classiﬁcation performance
for all compartments except for the peroxisome where perform-
ance remained unchanged (Supplementary Fig. S4C). The largest
increases in MCC score were observed for Golgi (+ 1.9%), mito-
chondrion (+ 2.5%) and vacuole (+ 1.5%).

4.6 A combination of in silico predictions and
experimental data has the highest localization
accuracy

All four sources of experimental data combined provided input
data for 17341 proteins (a proteome coverage of 49%). The
remaining proteins (51%) were classiﬁed based solely on compu-
tational integration of predictor algorithms. SUBAcon was
trained on ASURE, and classiﬁcation calls were generated for
all proteins and splice variants according to TAIR10. The clas-
siﬁcation performance of SUBAcon was compared with the 22
predictors (naive Bayes) and all single components (within their
proteome coverage).

SUBAcon - Arabidopsis subcellular protein location consensus

 

Generally, MI (1.026) and accuracies were highest when inte-
grating all 26 components (Supplementary Fig. S4A, Table 1).
Each experimental component added to the increase of the over-
all MI (Supplementary Fig. S4B). The integration of experimen-
tal data improved the classiﬁcation most for Golgi and vacuolar
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S4C) for which computational pre-
diction algorithms performed the poorest. The evaluation of the
performance in individual compartments showed that SUBAcon
achieved high classiﬁcation performance (Fig. 2) and accuracy
(Table 1) compared with all single predictors and the classiﬁer
trained on prediction calls alone. The distribution of features for
each location category across components integrated in
SUBAcon indicated that no component was error-free
(Supplementary Fig. S6). Thereafter, SUBAcon decision-
making is determined by the output frequencies for data channel
of each component. For some compartments (e.g. cat-
egory = mitochondrion), the classiﬁcation was highly inﬂuenced
by experimental data and at some single predictors that pro-
duced the same compartment outputs (feature = mitochondrion)
as the ﬁnal SUBAcon call. In contrast, the probability increase
for other compartments (e.g. category = extracellular) derived
from combinations of features (e.g. features = extracellular,
vacuole and Golgi). Altering the balance between computational
predictions and experimental observations by decreasing the
number of computational predictors used did not change the
overall performance of SUBAcon (data not shown).

4.7 SUBAcon estimates plausible subcellular proteome
sizes using all available data

Using output calls from single prediction algorithms as well as
subcellular proteome size approximations derived from the lit-
erature (Supplementary Table S12), we compared the estimated
subcellular proteome size ranges with the SUBAcon classiﬁer-
derived estimates. The range predicted by different algorithms
was large (Fig. 3) with mitochondrion, cytosol and endoplasmic
reticulum proteomes mostly overpredicted in size and plasma
membrane proteome mostly underestimated in size. SUBAcon
estimated subcellular proteome sizes closer to the mean predicted
proteome sizes and close to manually curated estimates from
experts in the ﬁeld (Table 2). The classiﬁcation of endoplasmic
reticulum and Golgi was most conservative, whereas the plasma
membrane proteome size was large compared with predictor es-
timates but within the range suggested by several independent
studies (Ahnen et al., 2009; Elmore et al., 2012; Guda, 2010;
Komatsu, 2008; Marmagne et al., 2004). SUBAcon avoided
overprediction of mitochondrial and plastid proteome size.

4.8 SUBAcon attempts to classify multi—targeted proteins

To address multi-targeted proteins in the Arabidopsis proteome,
the SUBAcon output probability for single or multilocation pro-
teins was assessed. By varying the probability cut-off in both
phases, we found that for any 0.1 increase in probability thresh-
old above 0.5, more than twice as many false calls than true
calls were added as second locations decreasing the compartmen-
tal (MCC) and overall (MI) classiﬁcation performance
(Supplementary Fig. S7A). This led to choosing 0.5 as a conser-
vative threshold yielding a total number of 1501 (4.2%)
multi-targeted proteins. SUBAcon assigned 1482 protiens to

cation proteins. Relative to subproteome sizes, again secretory
compartments exhibited a higher percentage of multi-targeted
proteins (Supplementary Fig. S7B). In contrast, plastids, mito-
chondria and nucleus had the lowest percentage of multi-targeted
proteins relative to their subcellular proteome size.

5 DISCUSSION

The subcellular localization of proteins is a critical step toward
understanding protein function and developing networks repre-
senting the biological processes within eukaryotic cells. Several
tools have been developed to predict subcellular locations to help
ﬁll gaps in experimental datasets (Imai and Nakai, 2010). As
experimental data resources grow and the number of predictors
increases, new strategies are needed to integrate this multi-
faceted information. SUBAcon integrates 22 published pre-
dictors and four experimental data types to generate a probabil-
ity distribution of subcellular location for each Arabidopsis
protein. This objectively weighs individual predictors and experi-
mental data to assign proteins to a location (or locations) more
accurately than any of the input predictors or data can alone.

SUBAcon implements a naive Bayes algorithm, which is the
simplest form of a Bayesian network and assumes that all inputs
are independent. Input variable independence in real life is nearly
impossible to meet, but nevertheless naive Bayes classiﬁers often
perform comparably or superior to other more complex algo-
rithms not relying on this criterion (Regnier-Coudert et al.,
2012; Zhang, 2005). Of the 22 predictors used in this study, at
least half used similar protein properties to generate the location
calls. However, it is the generated location calls that act as the
actual naive Bayes input variables, and as these did not correlate
strongly (Supplementary Fig. S3) and overlap surprisingly poorly
(Supplementary Table S12), we considered that independence
criteria were met.

Based on the naive Bayes theory, redundant or weak pre-
dictors do not worsen the classiﬁcation performance but can
provide signiﬁcant noise reduction and performance improve-
ment when used integrated (Guyon and Elisseff, 2003).

SUBAcon - Arabidopsis subcellular protein location consensus

 

Beneﬁts of selecting informative predictors but omitting redun-
dant ones have been reported in previously developed ensemble
predictors, e. g. PROlocalizer (Laurila and Vihinen, 2011), as well
as KNN single algorithms, and voting systems (Liu et al., 2013)
or SVM (Li et al., 2012; Shen et al., 2007). In contrast to the
latter studies, we did not omit any predictor or data channel.
This avoids overﬁtting data to ASURE by selecting ASURE-
speciﬁc non-redundancies as well as omitting potential informa-
tion beneﬁting classiﬁcation. These strategies have been dis-
cussed as the main strength of the naive Bayes over other
integration methodologies (Kuncheva, 2006).

Furthermore, naive Bayes networks can handle many dimen-
sions of information and are superior to other classiﬁers when
large numbers of variables are being considered (Regnier-
Coudert et al., 2012). We integrated four independent experimen-
tal data types into SUBAcon. Similar large-scale integration of
experimental localization data into algorithms as a ‘prediction’
has not been reported for Arabidopsis, but a recent report has
indicated that experimental evidence derived by automated
mining of annotations, abstracts or proteome databases similar
to SUBA3 has been a valuable improvement on top of sequence-
based predictions (Binder et al., 2014). SUBAcon uses manually
curated GFP as well as MS, PPI and co-expression data that
cannot be accessed using automated text mining. All four data
types contributed to improving classiﬁcation accuracy.
Assessment of classiﬁcation improvement for each type of
experimental data showed that despite the overall highest
improvement achieved by MS, it was the GFP-tagging data
that contributed most for the proteins where these data are avail-
able. Further, we have shown that PPI data despite being a small
dataset have informative same-location properties. While such
data have been shown to be effective for location prediction
in yeast (Jiang and Wu, 2012), they have been underused in
Arabidopsis until now. Similarly, co-expression data have been
widely used for predicting function but not subcellular location
in Arabidopsis (Heyndrickx and Vandepoele, 2012). The present
study has shown that co-expression alone is highly informative of
location for the plastid and endoplasmic reticulum. In addition,
it has analytical value for other compartments that rivals some
sequence-based predictors within coverage.

We have built SUBAcon in a modular structure allowing easy
integration of new datasets and predictors. SUBAcon will be
retrained regularly on updating experimental localization data
in SUBA3. In light of the strong inﬂuence of experimental
data on classiﬁcation outcome, this will be a key aspect of up-
to-date classiﬁcation. In the context of systems biology
approaches, knowledge of proteome-wide subcellular locations
is an important component for deﬁning functional neighbor-
hoods and deducing metabolic and signaling networks within
complex eukaryotic cells. We anticipate SUBAcon to be a
broadly applicable and helpful tool for experimentalists and mod-
elers requiring systematic information on Arabidopsis proteins or
homologs from other plants.

5.1 Access to SUBAcon

SUBAcon is a one-stop tool for Arabidopsis protein localization
that integrates 22 prediction outputs and 4 complementary
experimental data types to arrive at a consensus call with

superior accuracy to any single component. It is available
through the search page of SUBA3 (http://suba.plantenergy.
uwa.edu.au), and its outputs are retrieved automatically when
downloading batch query results. The source code and data
input table for SUBAcon are available through our Web site
(http://suba.plantenergy.uwa.edu.au/SUBAcon.html). The user
can submit lists of protein identiﬁers (AGIs), and the SUBA
result page provides the SUBAcon consensus call as well as
underlying single evidence for user-based interpretation.

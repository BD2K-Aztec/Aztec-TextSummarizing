ABSTRACT

Summary: TRFolder-W is a web server capable of predicting core
structures of telomerase RNA (TR) in yeast genomes. TRFolder is a
command-line Python toolkit for TR-specific structure prediction. We
developed a web-version built on the django web framework, lever-
aging the work done previously, to include enhancements to increase
flexibility of usage. To date, there are five core sub-structures com-
monly found in TR of fungal species, which are the template region,
downstream pseudoknot, boundary element, core-closing stem and
triple helix. The aim of TRFolder-W is to use the five core structures as
fundamental units to predict potential TR genes for yeast, and to pro-
vide a user-friendly interface. Moreover, the application of TRFolder-W
can be extended to predict the characteristic structure on species
other than fungal species.

Availability: The web server TRFolder-W is available at http://

1 INTRODUCTION

The ability of telomerase to repair telomeres increases the
cell-division cycles of a lineage, each of which otherwise shortens
the telomeres. Telomerase RNA (TR) is one fundamental com-
ponent of telomerase. Secondary structure prediction facilitates
identifying TR genes which are highly divergent in their se-
quences. Compared to the sequences, the secondary structures
of TR are much more conserved. There are few existing compu-
tational tools that can accurately predict TR structures; the
difﬁculties are mainly caused by the extensive variance in TR
sequences and stem-loop length, and structures such as the
pseudoknot.

In our previous work, TRFolder showed a high accuracy for
known yeast TR structures folding, and gave predictions with
high conﬁdence for unknown yeast TR structures. The reported
limitations of usage of TRFolder mainly focus on installation
troubleshooting and the template position requirement.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Therefore, we developed a web version of TRF older capable of
pseudoknot prediction without input of the template position.

2 FUNCTIONALITIES OF THE SYSTEM

TRFolder-W accepts a FASTA ﬁle as input which allows mul-
tiple sequences. The template position for each sequence can be
provided in the identiﬁer line. If the template position is un-
known, TRFolder-W will predict just the pseudoknot. The
system has the following functionalities.

(l) Predicting pseudoknot structure: 5’ pseudoknot structures
close to the template sequence are extensively found in
fungi. TRFolder-W starts with pseudoknot searching,
and is able to target all the pseudoknot-like structures
assembled from two potential stem-loops.

(2) Predicting triple helix structure: a triple helix motif within
the pseudoknot, which is mainly U-A pairs, has been
identiﬁed in Kluyveromyces. This is implemented in
TRF older as a ﬁltering functionality; triple helix folding
will signiﬁcantly reduce the number of pseudoknot-like
candidates.

(3) Predicting the boundary element: The boundary element is
a stem-loop structure located at upstream of the template
sequence. For a given position of the template,
TRFolder-W will predict a boundary element.

(4) Predicting core closing stem: The core closing stem is a
long-range base-pair region containing the bounding
boundary element, template and pseudoknot. For each
combination of boundary element and pseudoknot, its
enclosing sequence will be further folded to shape a core
closing stem.

(5) Adjusting the stem-loop scan window size: A pseudoknot
structure is shaped by two crossing and non-overlapping
stems. The window size for stem searching can be adjusted
by users. The current window size was trained from known
yeast pseudoknots.

(6) Incorporating user’s training data: A logodds matrix, rep-
resenting the frequency of pairing between each of two
bases (Guo et al., 2011), is applied to measure the likeli-
hood of structure predictions. For each core structure, one
5 x 5 logodds matrix was trained on the basis of known
yeast TR structures. TRFolder-W allows the user to use
other scoring matrices instead.

3 INTERFACE FEATURES

Users can use either text-based input or local ﬁle uploading to
submit their dataset. Since users may not have training data, we
organized parameter settings into two panels to avoid confusion.
The basic panel provides a set of parameters optimized to predict
all known TR structure in yeast, which could also be subse-
quently applied to other species. Since the template position is
also usually unknown, the panel allows users to optionally search
boundary element and core closing stem. The default stem-loop
scan window size and logodds matrices were trained from known
TR structures. The advanced panel can be used by users who
have training data. Using modiﬁed settings, the prediction result
can be signiﬁcantly changed. After submission of data,
TRFolder-W will display an estimate of the running time used
in the searching process and redirect to a result page once the
search is done. It also gives an explicit URL to the result page
that the user can check back for search results. The folding struc-
tures make use of bracket view which is commonly used in RNA
folding. For each query sequence, the top 10 scored candidates
will be listed by default and the user can select a different
number.

4 PERFORMANCE SUMMARY

TRFolder-W successfully conﬁrmed TR structures of
Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces which have been published.
To date, TRs of ﬁve Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces (Lin
et al., 2004; Shefer et al., 2007; Tzfati et al., 2000) that are
Kluyveromyces lactis, Kluyveromyces dobzhanskii, Kluyveromyces
aestuarii, Kluyveromyces nonfermentans, Kluyveromyces wicker-
hamii, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Saccharomyces kudriavzevii,
Saccharomyces cariocanus, Saccharomyces paradoxus and
Saccharomyces mikatas have been proposed in multiple litera-
tures. Except for K. wickerhamii which has a different stem 1
of the pseudoknot, TRFolder-W is capable of predicting highly
similar TR core structures to published ones. The minor vari-
ances are mainly attributed to published structures having many
non-canonical base pairs such as U—U and bulges. These limita-
tions might be overcome by simply increasing the number of
training data.

In addition to verifying published TRs, TRFolder-W was
applied to predict TR structures for six novel yeast species,
which are Candida glabrata, Ashbya gossypii, Candida albicans,
Candida guilliermondii, Pichia stipitis and Delphinium hansenii. In
most of these species, the TR genes recently identiﬁed by
Gunisova et al. (2009) were also conﬁrmed by our independent
analysis. The typical signals of potentially correct TR structures
consist of pseudoknot candidates close to putative templates,
good stem-loop structures and TR core structures within the
range of TR genes. Using TRFolder-W, we were able to identify
template-close pseudoknot candidates in C. albicans, A. gossypii,
P. stipiti and D. hansenii, all of which have long stem-loop for

TR core structures. In C. guilliermondii and C. albicans, the
structure predictions fall within the mapped genes. The pseudo-
knot and triple helix predicted in C. glabrata is highly similar to
those recently proposed by Kachouri-Lafond et al. (2009).

TRFolder-W was used to predict TR core structures for a
novel yeast species Candida parapsilosis which was not included
in our previous studies (Guo et al., 2011). The telomerase RNA
gene sequence and telomeric repeat sequence for C. parapsilosis
have been available in the NCBI and Telomerase Database
(http://telomerase.asu.edu/) individually. TRFolder-W is able
to predict top ranked template-close pseudoknot, triple helix
and boundary element candidates, all of which have the
stem-loop structure and distance to template ﬁtting within the
length proﬁle deﬁned by published TR structures in
Saccharomyces and Kluyveromyces (Supplementary Table S1).
TRFolder-W also detected a core-closing stem candidate with
7 bp stem length outside C. parapsilosis RNA gene by searching
its 2kb surrounding genome sequence.

As a model organism, Caenorhabditis elegans telomerase RNA
has not yet been reported. We used TRFolder-W on segments of
C. elegans DNA and found 11 potential telomerase RNA struc-
tures for the further experimental validation. This indicates
TRFolder-W may be applicable to species other than fungal
species to reduce a set of candidate telomerase RNA regions to
a smaller set.

TRFolder-W employs an exhaustive search approach in time
0( W3 N), where W is the size of the stem-loop seaming window
and N is the length of the sequence, to predict TR core struc-
tures. W is a parameter that can be set with a known range, but it
could be as long as N. Since this is computationally expensive
and time consuming, for each species, a 4kb RNA sequence cut
from the genome surrounding the template was usually used to
do test. TRFolder-W uses the features of TR structures to pro-
vide a means to identify TR genes and can be used as an alter-
native TR—speciﬁc structure prediction toolkit.

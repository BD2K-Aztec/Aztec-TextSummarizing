ABSTRACT

Motivation: There is an urgent need for new medications to combat
influenza pandemics.

Methods: Using the genome analysis of the influenza A virus
performed previously, we designed and performed a combinatorial
exhaustive systematic methodology for optimal design of universal
therapeutic small interfering RNA molecules (siRNAs) targeting all
diverse influenza A viral strains. The rationale was to integrate the
factors for highly efficient design in a pipeline of analysis performed
on possible influenza-targeting siRNAs. This analysis selects specific
siRNAs that has the ability to target highly conserved, accessible and
biologically significant regions. This would require minimal dosage
and side effects.

Results and Discussion: First, >6000 possible siRNAs were
designed. Successive filtration followed where a novel method
for siRNA scoring filtration layers was implemented. This method
excluded siRNAs below the 90% experimental inhibition mapped
scores using the intersection of 12 different scoring algorithms.
Further filtration of siRNAs is done by eliminating those with off-
targets in the human genome and those with undesirable properties
and selecting siRNA targeting highly probable single-stranded
regions. Finally, the optimal properties of the siRNA were ensured
through selection of those targeting 100% conserved, biologically
functional short motifs. Validation of a predicted active (sh114) and
a predicted inactive (sh113) (that was filtered out in Stage 8) silencer
of the N81 gene showed significant inhibition of the N81 gene
for sh114, with negligible decrease for sh113 which failed target
accessibility. This demonstrated the fertility of this methodology.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 siRNA importance

RNA interference (RNAi) is a naturally occurring endogenous
biological post—transcriptional cellular mechanism that regulates
against foreign genetic elements, such as viruses and inserted
gene transcripts, as well as in—home gene expression regulation.
Small interfering RNA (siRNA) molecules utilize this mechanism
to promote homology—dependent messenger RNA (mRNA)
degradation (Ichim et al., 2004). siRNA triggers the formation of
the RNA—induced silencing complex (RISC) in which the double—
stranded siRNA is incorporated and unwound, and then binds
to the target mRNA sequence, resulting in its cleavage (Meister
et al., 2004). The utilization of siRNA as a molecular target to
silence gene expression has been extensive as a research tool in
functional genomics (Taylorl et al., 2008). The unprecedented
advantage of siRNA molecules, due to their ability to effectively and
speciﬁcally inhibit disease—causing genes, raised great expectations
in therapeutic applications and drug discovery (Chen et al., 2008;
Kim and Rossi, 2007; Naito et al., 2007). Advantages of siRNA
therapeutics include their feasibility in clinical trials and the fact
that they do not rely on an intact immune system. For a review of
current siRNA drugs, see Vaishnaw et al. (2011).

1.2 Features of effective siRNAs

The identiﬁcation of structural and sequence positional reference
elements that characterize highly functional siRNAs have been
elucidated in previous studies (Patzel, 2007). For a large—scale
feature selection study, see Klingelhoefer et al. (2009). First,
sequence space conservation is determinative, as a single base
pair change in the 5’ or central region of the siRNA may affect
functionality (Birmingham et al., 2007). It is worth noting that
mismatches found at the 3’ end of the antisense strand siRNA
duplex have minimal to no effect on functionality (Naito et al.,
2009). Second, the sequence of the designed siRNA duplex
including antisense positional preferences and words have been
determined by early classical works (e.g. Amarzguioui and Prydz,

2004; Hsieh et al., 2004) and reﬁned by use of statistical and
artiﬁcial intelligence models contribute to the activity of siRNAs by
enhancing strand selection, target annealing and cleavage (Shabalina
et al., 2006). While unwanted features include repeats, low—
complexity regions, immune—stimulating motifs and others (Gredell
et al., 2008; Klingelhoefer et al., 2009; Lu and Mathews, 2008).
Third, the thermodynamic properties including the structures of
both the siRNA and targeted mRNA and its accessibility are highly
determinant for siRNA efﬁcacy. For example, palindromes may
cause unwanted secondary structures, lowering the probability of
siRNA loading onto the RISC. Factors that increase the duplex
stability resulting in the inhibition of the unwinding, such as high
GC content, are unfavorable. Notably, differential end stability
represents the most signiﬁcant single feature in determining siRNA
efﬁcacy, since the more ﬂexible (less stable) 5’ end of the duplex
is loaded onto RISC the greater the efﬁciency (Birmingham et al.,
2007; Ichihara et al., 2007). Fourth, to ensure speciﬁcity to target
regions, siRNA speciﬁcity can be enhanced by including a sequence
alignment ﬁlter and eliminating all candidate siRNAs that have
perfect or near—perfect complementarities with unintended targets
(Birmingham et al., 2007). siRNA can also induce moderate
levels of gene knockdown by seed—mediated translation attenuation
(Birmingham et al., 2006). This process of off—targeting can be
minimized by including design parameters that select siRNA with
low 3’ untranslated region (UTR) seed complement frequencies
(Jackson et al., 2006b). In addition, siRNA length between 21 and
23 bp manages to overcome the non—speciﬁc interferon—mediated
immune response (Jackson and Linsley, 2010).

1.3 Inﬂuenza and RNAi

The genome of inﬂuenza A viruses consists of eight single—stranded
negative sense RNA segments that encode 10 or 11 viral proteins.
The N81 protein is an RNA binding protein that contributes to viral
pathogenicity and plays a central role in the prevention of interferon—
mediated antiviral response. NSl protein is essential for the ability of
inﬂuenza viruses to productively infect humans, and the generation
of an HlNl mutant virus bearing NS] deletions in its genomes results
in the formation of an attenuated strain upon infection of macaca
Rhesus monkeys (Baskin et al., 2007). The feasibility of targeting
inﬂuenzaA virus was previously demonstrated in studies by Ge et al.
(2003) and Zhou et al. (2007) who showed that siRNAs speciﬁc
to conserved regions of the NP and M segments were successful
potent and long—term inhibitors of inﬂuenza viral replication in cell
lines, embryonated chicken eggs and mice. Expression plasmids
that provide a more sustained siRNA production inside cells were
also successfully utilized (Sui et al., 2009; Zhou et al., 2007,
2008). Interestingly, local successful delivery of nucleic acids to the
respiratory tract was achieved using aerosols (Dreyfus et al., 2007).
However, targeting escape mutants and all diverse strains in addition
to other drug design heralds are still to be met (McSwiggen and Seth,
2008). Although, databases for mammalian gene silencing exist
(Ren et al., 2006), iRNAs for pathogens silencing and therapeutic
applications require careful design considerations.

In our previous work, a systematic genomic analysis of the
inﬂuenza A virus was performed, which revealed genome—conserved
regions, accessible regions, functional motifs, and a cross—species
conservation and variability (ElHefnawi, 2011). Here, design and
selection of optimal siRNAs for all diverse strains of the inﬂuenza

A virus are performed by integration of the factors that affect the
functionality, speciﬁcity and potency of the siRNAs. For more
details on the bioinformatics applications to the design and selection
of efﬁcient siRNAs, see the chapter of ElHefnawi (2011). Efﬁcient
siRNA design is very important to increase potency and hence
decrease dosage and possible side effects. Thus, a novel approach is
deduced with high fertility in eliminating false positives which has
been tested experimentally as a pilot phase on the NS] gene to test for
both the siRNA that was predicted to be efﬁcient and a siRNA that
was predicted to give low efﬁcacy due to target inaccessibility. Thus,
providing a candidate best set of siRNAs for ﬁve segments of the
virus recommended for animal models and clinical trials. The steps
presented here include designing of all possible siRNAs using the
consensus sequences of the conserved regions. This included both
ﬁrst—generation algorithms, which focused on sequence features,
followed by second—generation algorithms, which included many
other features including scoring, thermodynamics of the siRNAs
and target accessibility. In Stage 7, novel multiscore—ﬁltration was
performed. Criteria were based on deﬁning accepted threshold
scores after mapping the second—generation scores to the inhibitory
percent of the Heuskin/Novartis siRNA training set (Huesken et al.,
2005). This was followed by omitting siRNAs with off—target effects
(<2 mismatches to the off—target mRNAs), siRNA undesirable
sequence motifs and low—target accessibility proﬁle. The outcome
was a potential set of siRNAs for each of the studied segments,
which can be potentially used as a new medication for the virus.
We present the siRNA design methodology (Fig. l), and elaborate
on ﬁltering, selection, scoring and optimizing steps. Experimental
validation of two siRNAs targeting the NS] mRNA was performed;
one that passed all stages of ﬁltration and selection, and one that
passed all stages except Stage 8 of target accessibility check, where
it was predicted to be target inaccessible. This demonstrated the
fertility of this approach in eliminating false positives and the
marked signiﬁcance of target accessibility on the functionality of
siRNAs. The NS] gene was chosen for the validation phase because
it was not tested before for silencing, as it is more variable than
some of the other segments and thus being a harder target to
handle (ElHefnawi, 2011). This study considered challenges and
factors including: (i) viral resistance by continuous mutation (even
a single mismatch) in the viral genome, which helps its escape
from the targeted siRNA; (ii) viral resistance through changes in
the target accessibility including changes in the RNA secondary
structure—similar changes were reported with HIV (Suzuki et al.,
2008); (iii) wide off—target effects of siRNAs due to high sequence
homology with human mRNA transcripts; and (iv) genetic re—
assortment of inﬂuenza genome in the future that may lead to
potential novel strains causing great pathogenicity. To overcome
the ﬁrst two challenges, our strategy included targeting the highly
structurally conserved regions, targeting the virus with more than
one siRNA to increase the chances of preventing possible mutations,
and downregulating several essential biological functions. Our
strategy to overcome the third challenge was achieved by completely
omitting off—targeting siRNAs, since previous studies have revealed
that partial complementation to cellular mRNAs and mismatches
to target mRNA has a wide off—targeting effect (Jackson et al.,
2006a). This was overcome by adding a second phase of off—
target ﬁltering for siRNAs with seed matches to 3’ UTR of human
mRNAs. To overcome the fourth challenge, we designed siRNAs
that could target the highly conserved and functionally essential

regions in the genome (ElHefnawi, 2011). Also, inclusion of other
species in the selection, analysis and design ensures that siRNAs
remains valuable for future strains that would emerge from other
hosts. The impact of the study would be to have a model for a
systematic, comprehensive and novel in silico approach that was
also experimentally tested, that could be replicated for other viruses
and whose siRNA genome predictions close the gap between the
accelerating ﬁelds of bioinformatics and experimental sciences. This
approach is similar to the virtual screening of chemical databases
for ﬁnding/optimizing leads, and we hope it will be further modiﬁed
for other classes of non-coding RNA molecules like miRNA/RNA
aptamers. To our knowledge, this systematic exhaustive approach
of siRNA designing, ﬁltration and selection, using an integrated set
of tools and algorithms, as well as extensive bioinformatics analysis
has not been previously performed.

2 METHODS

Figure 1, depicts a ﬂow chart outlining the nine—stage approach for design
ranking and selection of optimal siRNAs against the diverse strains of the
inﬂuenza A virus.

Stages 1—4 were addressed in detail in ElHefnawi (2011). Inﬂuenza A
virus genome segments from different hosts, different subtypes and different
geographic regions were analyzed in silico. Genomic conserved regions

across all diverse strains and hosts were extracted from the multiple sequence
alignments and the conservation percentage was calculated. Additionally,
analysis of interinﬂuenza and intrainﬂuenza host—origin variability in
different segments and the GC percentage of the segments in the different
hosts were performed. Conserved genomic regions were correlated with
biologically functional motifs for appropriate functional annotation. The
current work addresses Stages 5—9 as outlined in Figure l. The workﬂow
outlined in Figure l was semiautomated using BioPerl scripts.

2.1 Stage 5: siRNA design

Two siRNA datasets were designed by different tools using each of the
consensus sequences of conserved regions separately as an input in order for
the siRNA to target the viral mRNAs in all species. The ﬁrst siRNA dataset
was designed using siVirus (which uses a pre—compiled human inﬂuenza A
segment sequences database) (Naito et al., 2006). This was done by ﬁnding
all possible siRNAs that are selected based on the conserved nucleotide
region positions and then rank them based on their percent of targeting in
all the studied strains. Also, it has a tool siDirect (Naito et al., 2004), which
checks siRNAs for off—targets.

The second siRNA dataset was designed using diverse tools: siRNA
software design siRNA Design Software (SDS) (Ichim et al., 2004; Yiu
et al., 2005) version 3, the THERMO—COMPOSITION 19 & 21 (Shabalina
et al., 2006), DSIR (Vert et al., 2006), SCALES (Matveeva et al., 2007) and
ISCORE (Ichihara et al., 2007) programs.

The siVirus designs siRNAs based on any of the three popularly utilized
basic algorithms for design (Naito et al., 2006). The SDS server uses ﬁrst— and
second— generation algorithms in the design process, as well as algorithms of
different pharmaceutical companies (Yiu et al., 2005). While the ISCORE
software designs and scores the efﬁcacy of siRNAs according to many
different ﬁrst— and second—generation algorithms, and has its own score
(Ichihara et al., 2007).

2.2 Stage 6: Ranking the siRNA by scoring and sorting

The total number of siRNAs designed using siVirus software (Dataset l)
were sorted and ranked according to many criteria:

(1) Conservation percentage of the target region among the sequences.

(2) The number of guidelines satisﬁed by the siRNAs. The basic
guidelines for siRNA designs, established by Tuschl et a]. (2001),
Reynolds et al., (2004), Amarzguioui and Prydz (2004), Ui—Tei et a].
(2004) and Hsieh et a]. (2004), were checked in the siRNAs. Ranking
based on the fulﬁllment of these guidelines was performed.

(3) Off targets in the human genome.

Also, the siRNAs from both datasets were scored using all available second—
generation scoring algorithms, including the i—Score Designer, DSIR, siRNA
SCALES, THERMO—COMPOSITION 19 & 21 (Shabalina et al., 2006)
and S—Biopredsi programs (Ichihara et al., 2007; Ichim et al., 2004),
which were based on different machine learning approaches for selecting
the best siRNAs. The i—Score Designer includes most of these scoring
algorithms implemented. THERMO—COMPOSITION l9 & 21 is based
on thermodynamics as well as compositional features like dinucleotide
frequency index. The SCALES tool also implemented linear regression to
derive positional preferences for the siRNA sequence (Matveeva et al., 2007).

2.3 Stage 7: primary ﬁltering using threshold scores
and exact off-target matches

Stage 7 was performed using three selection criteria; mapping threshold
scores for 70 and 90% experimental inhibition and ﬁltering the siRNAs
below the average threshold scores of all 11 utilized algorithms, off—targets
and exclusion of siRNAs with undesirable nucleotide properties.
Well—characterized siRNAs, with a measured inhibition percent to their
target genes, were utilized in order to systematically interpret the scoring

results of the different algorithms and ﬁlter the best and most potent
siRNAs. The Huesken experimental Biopredsi siRNAs learning dataset
(Huesken et al., 2005) was utilized, scored and experimental inhibition
efﬁciency mapped to the different algorithm scores in order to calculate
the average, start and end scores for the 70 and 90% cutoff scores. The
siRNAs in both datasets were sorted according to these scores and underwent
successive ﬁltration, so the remaining siRNAs exceed the threshold of all
algorithms. Next, the siRNAs were locally aligned using BLAST against
the human mRNA reference sequence database (Meister et al., 2004) using
the parameters provided in the classical Birmingham protocol (Birmingham
et al., 2007). A BioPerl script was used for the automation of this step. The
matches were manually screened and scrutinized, and the siRNAs with less
than two mismatches to a human mRNA (off—targets) were ﬁrst excluded,
and later other highly matching siRNAs were ﬁltered. Finally, siRNAs
with unwanted parameters were ﬁltered. These parameters include high GC
stretches, trinucleotide palindromes, more than ﬁve consecutive repeated
nucleotides, internal repeats and 4G stretches as well as other undesirable
properties plus additional measures outlined in the Birmingham protocol
(Birmingham et 61]., 2007).

2.4 Stage 8: thermodynamic properties and target
accessibility

A number of tools such as I—Score, SFOLD and RNAXs were used in this
stage for target accessibility and thermodynamics calculation and evaluation.
The i—Score Designer results (Ichihara et al., 2007) provided the whole and
partial dG of each siRNA. The SFOLD and RNAXs tools (Ding at 611.,
2004) were used to calculate different contributions to the target accessibility
using the consensus of each segment. This is accomplished by mapping
highly probable single—stranded regions in the inﬂuenza A virus segments.
The measure of the binding afﬁnity and target accessibility combined was
assessed using the RNAUP tool that is part of the RNAXs tool (Muckstein
et al., 2006; Tafer et al., 2008). The number of single—stranded base pairs at
the 5’ and 3’ ends of the target mRNA has recently been shown to signiﬁcantly
contribute to the effectiveness of siRNAs by Patzel et a]. (2005) in their recent
patent ‘structure of active guide RNA molecules and method of selection’.
The same conclusion was reached by Gredell et a]. (2008) and Tafer et a].
(2008), therefore this was also used as criteria for ﬁltering with a threshold of
>0.5 average probability of the ﬁve nucleotides at the 5’ and four nucleotides
at the 3’ UTRs.

2.5 Stage 9: ﬁnal optimization steps

In substage 9a, the 90% potent siRNAs (from substage 7b) were mapped
to functional motif regions on the inﬂuenza genome (100% conserved)
as a ﬁrst line of selection where the 90% siRNA set was analyzed to
select the siRNAs that target functional motifs. Then, in substage 9b,
the resulting siRNAs were added to Stage 8 output from multiple target
accessibility analysis. Additionally, this was followed by ﬁltering to include
siRNAs which target highly accessible regions (>0.5 average probability
at the 5’ and 3’ ends). This allowed us to combine highly potent siRNAs
that are universally applicable for the diverse inﬂuenza strains and target
biologically signiﬁcant sites.

The second phase of off—targets search (implemented in 90) ﬁltered
siRNAs with seed region complementarity to human mRNA 3’ UTR (Jackson
et al., 2006b). This was based on recent ﬁndings that exact complementarity
at the 3’ UTR region with nucleotides 2—7 at 5’ end of the antisense
strand of the siRNA molecule (seed region) enhances the chances of partial
translational attenuation (Jackson and Linsley, 2010). This was done by
searching the Ensemble genome browser (Hubbard et al., 2009) for matches
with the designed siRNAs seed region at 3’ UTR of the various human gene
transcripts.

2.6 Best siRNAs

The efﬁciency and suitability of siRNA for use as universal silencers of
inﬂuenza A virus were investigated by manual selection according to the
following criteria: the ﬁnal selection lists of ‘best siRNAs’ included only
those siRNAs with target mRNA region conservation >90%, no ﬁrst— or
second—phase off—targets, low RNAUP total energy score for accessibility,
and single—stranded probability score for terminal ends >0.5 using the single—
stranded probability score generated by SFOLD and RNAXs.

3 EXPERIMENTAL MATERIALS & METHODS

Cell line: human embryonic kidney (HEK) cell line was grown in
Dulbecco’s modiﬁed Eagle’s medium (Bio—Whittaker, Cambrex Bio
Science, Verviers, Belgium), supplemented with 10% fetal bovine
serum (Biological Industries, Kibbutz Beit Haemek, Israel) and
antibiotics.

Plasmids: the coding sequence of the N81 protein was obtained
from the Italian National Inﬂuenza Center (ISS, Rome, Italy)
belonging to an Italian isolate of the H1N1 2009 swine pandemic
inﬂuenza A virus. The DNA vector expressing the above mentioned
NSl protein (pFLAG CMV2 NSl H1N1v) was obtained. First,
the N81 coding sequence generated by de novo gene synthesis
(GenScript USA Inc., Piscataway, NJ, USA) is provided into the
pUC57 cloning vector. Then, it was subcloned, in—frame with the
FLAG epitope, into the pFLAG CMV2 expression vector (Sigma—
Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA). The ‘in—frame’ insertion of the
N81 H1N1 coding sequence with the sequence of the FLAG
epitope was veriﬁed by DNA sequencing. NS 1 —speciﬁc pU6 shRNA—
expressing vectors (sh113 and sh114) as well as the luciferase—
speciﬁc expressing vector (shLuc) were also obtained in the same
way, which is de novo gene synthesis (GenScript USA Inc.), and
then provided into the pUC57 cloning vector.

Transient transfection: HEK 293 cells were seeded at 1:6 dilutions
from a 90% conﬂuent plate 24h prior to transfection. Transient
transfection experiments were performed using the calcium
phosphate transfection system (Life Technologies, invitrogen
Corporation, Carlsbad, CA, USA). Upon 17 h, medium was replaced
and cells were collected 7 h later.

Immunoblotting analysis: transfected HEK 293 cells were
lysed in 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate loading dye supplemented
with 5% ,B—mercaptoethanol. Then, whole cell extracts (WCEs)
were loaded onto a 10% sodium dodecyl sulfate—polyacrylamide
gel electrophoresis upon boiling at 100°C for 5min and 30s
centrifugation to eliminate cell debris. Upon electrophoresis, WCEs
were transferred onto a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientiﬁc,
Rockford, IL, USA). Immunoblot analysis was performed by
probing blots with a monoclonal antibody (Ab) against the FLAG
epitope (Sigma—Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) and a polyclonal
Ab against ,B—actin (Santa Cruz Biotechnology Inc., Santa Cruz,
CA, USA), and then with anti—mouse or anti—goat horseradish
peroxidase—coupled secondary antibody (1:2000 dilution) (Santa
Cruz Biotechnology Inc.), respectively. The detection reaction was
performed using the SuperSignal West Pico Chemioluminescent
substrate (Thermo Scientiﬁc, Rockford, IL, USA).

As it is a big challenge to design universally applicable siRNAs
for inﬂuenza that are potent, speciﬁc and non—toxic, we sought

them out based on the many factors that affect siRNA efﬁciency.
Continuing previous work that utilized siRNAs against the M and
NP segments, the silencing of the NS] protein was also demonstrated
experimentally as a test of our methodology in addition to checking
the efﬁciency of the criteria by siRNAs that was ﬁltered out in Stage

(Fig. 2). Moreover, we provided the methodology and results for
each ﬁltration stage in Supplementary File S 1. The total siRNAs that
were designed (Stage 5) from both datasets, the siRNAs remaining
after the 70 and 90% inhibition cutoff scores ﬁltration (Stages 6 and
7), the siRNAs after the target accessibility ﬁltration (Stage 8) are all
displayed sequentially in the different sheets for all the six segments.
Ge et al. (2003) have formulated a broad inhibitor of inﬂuenza A
virus H1N1 strain: NP1496 and PA 2087. Our methodology has
similar extrapolated three siRNAs that target the same segments
(1499, 1500 in the Stage 8 siRNAs NP segment and 2088 in Stage 7
siRNAs). Similarly, Zhou et al. (2008) have tested H5N1 targeting
siRNAs.

Here, siRNAs targeting all diverse strains of inﬂuenza were
sought through analyzing different hosts, ﬁnding common conserved
regions and using the design power of the best recommended
second—generation algorithms.

This was complemented by target accessibility analysis of
the siRNAs using different approaches. Additionally, we selected
siRNAs that target functional and completely conserved motifs
to ensure a comprehensive exhaustive methodology for efﬁcient
potent siRNA selection. Out of the total designed siRNAs using
siVirus, and second—generation tools, more than half remained
after ﬁltering the 70% inhibition scores and omitting siRNAs with
less than two mismatches to human mRNAs. The RISC off—target

effect was eliminated by excluding all siRNAs with two or less
mismatches to human mRNAs. After mapping the siRNAs of
70% average experimental inhibition percent to various algorithms’
scores, hundreds of siRNA that covered the ﬁve inﬂuenza genome
remained. The highest number of siRNAs targets PB] (the largest
segment). Cropping the list to the scores corresponding to the 90%
inhibition reduced the numbers of siRNAs by more than a half, with
more than a hundred siRNA for each segment. Using optimization
steps, like choosing siRNAs with terminal ends having high single—
stranded probability, the remaining siRNAs in each segment were in
tens. Finally, using siRNAs that target functional conserved motifs,
the number of siRNAs in each segment was reduced substantially
to few siRNAs that we predict to be potent efﬁcient silencers.

4.1 Experimental validation of the optimal siRNAs

As detailed earlier, two siRNAs were inserted separately into
expression vectors along with controls and tested for their ability
to diminish the N81 protein production. Sh114 is the predicted
potent siRNA which is seg8cr06_114 in Stage 9a dataset 2 in
Supplementary File Sl after its insertion into the PUC57 vector.
Sh113 is the ﬁltered siRNA after Stage 8 target accessibility, which
is seg8cr06_113 in Stage 9a dataset 2 in Supplementary File Sl after
its insertion into the PUC57 vector. As illustrated in Figure 2, sh114
showed marked inhibition (0.3 relative to 2 for control) of the N81
protein, while sh113 showed much less inhibition (1.2 relative to 2
for control).

The N81 protein consists of two domains; the RNA—binding
domain and the effector domain. It has various functions
during inﬂuenza A virus infection such as protecting inﬂuenza
A virus against the antiviral state, inhibiting several kinds
of proinﬂammatory cytokines and blocking the maturation and
exportation of the host cellular antiviral mRNAs. Thus, it is regarded
as an appealing speciﬁc target for therapeutic intervention. This is
the ﬁrst demonstration of its inhibition using siRNAs.

The RNAXs tool which gave a lower accessibility for sh113
performed well in predicting target accessibility and this supports the
impact of target accessibility for efﬁcient siRNA design (Hofacker
and Tafer, 2010). Measuring the level of the protein itself rather than
the transcript gives a direct evidence of the silencing by siRNAs
since both mRNA and protein levels are equally affected by this
knock—down strategy (Tan et al., 2005). Also, the rational design
process that selected a few from thousands possible could further
help for other tasks of therapeutic siRNA design.

The choice of the N81 protein from the inﬂuenza A H1N1 2009
pandemic virus to test the efﬁcacy of the siRNAs designed here has
been made due to the inability of N81 from this strain to inhibit the
export of RNA polymerase II transcripts (Hale et al., 2010); this is of
crucial importance not to have a bias in the western blotting analysis,
when the N81 protein is expressed through an RNA polymerase II
transcribed vector.

In conclusion, this study explores an exhaustive methodology
to design the best siRNAs that can be tested as candidates for
therapeutic treatment of the recent avian and swine inﬂuenza strains
as well as emerging strains. Our study is a prototype for designing
siRNA to target highly divergent viral genomes. The best siRNAs
represented in Figure 3 that target ﬁve segments PB2, PB], NP,
M and NS are recommended as novel potent speciﬁc inhibitors
of inﬂuenza A virus and the siRNA targeting the NS] gene was

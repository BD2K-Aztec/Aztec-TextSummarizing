ABSTRACT

Motivation: Integral polytopic membrane proteins contain only two
types of folds in their transmembrane domains: oz-helix bundles and
ﬁ-barrels. The increasing number of available crystal structures of
these proteins permits an initial estimation of how sequence variability
affects the structure conservation in their transmembrane domains.
We, thus, aim to determine the painNise sequence identity necessary
to maintain the transmembrane molecular architectures compatible
with the hydrophobic nature of the lipid bilayer.

Results: Root-mean-square deviation (rmsd) and sequence identity
were calculated from the structural alignments of pairs of homologous
polytopic membrane proteins sharing the same fold. Analysis of these
data reveals that transmembrane segment pairs with sequence iden-
tity in the so-called ‘twilight zone’ (20—35%) display high-structural
similarity (rmsd<1.5A). Moreover, a large group of ﬁ-barrel pairs
with low-sequence identity (<20%) still maintain a close structural
similarity (rmsd<2.5 A). Thus, we conclude that fold preservation in
transmembrane regions requires less sequence conservation than for
globular proteins. These findings have direct implications in homology
modeling of evolutionary-related membrane proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

Integral polytopic membrane proteins mediate the interaction of
the cell with its surroundings, being involved in multiple cellular
processes, as selective molecular transport, signaling, respiration
and motility. Because of their relevance to cellular physiology
and their accessibility from the extracellular environment, mem-
brane proteins represent a signiﬁcant portion of therapeutic drug
targets (Arinaminpathy et al., 2009; Hopkins and Groom, 2002).
Particularly G protein-coupled receptors, transport proteins and
ion channels are among the most prominent target families for
the pharmaceutical industry.

Although membrane proteins represent ~20—30% of all pro-
teins in sequenced genomes (Krogh et al., 2001), only 2% of crys-
tal structures deposited in the Protein Data Bank are membrane
proteins (Tusnady et al., 2005a), mainly because of the difﬁculty

of their overexpression, puriﬁcation and crystallization (Bill
at al., 2011).

Thus, because of the limited high-resolution structural
information on membrane proteins, computational techniques
to predict their three-dimensional (3D) structure from the
amino acid sequence are a valuable tool (Pieper et al., 2013).
Recently, de novo techniques using evolutionary constraints
have been applied to predict 3D structures for transmembrane
(TM) proteins (Nugent and Jones, 2012). Homology models of
proteins with unknown experimental structure can also be built
from homologous proteins of known structure and similar
sequence (templates). This method is based on the fact that in
homologous proteins, structure is more conserved than sequence.
In general, homologous proteins with a sequence identity >35%
have a similar 3D structure. This similarity is less common
in pairs of homologous proteins with sequence identity in the
‘twilight zone’ (threshold of 20—35%) (Chothia and Lesk, 1986;
Krissinel and Henrick, 2004; Rost, 1999). Although these con-
clusions were achieved from the analysis of crystal structures
of soluble proteins, homology modeling methods are also appro-
priate for membrane proteins, obtaining rmsd<2A relative
to the native structure in the TM region for sequence identities
of 230% (Forrest et al., 2006). However, because of the relative
scarcity of reference structures, these methods are frequently
applied using templates with sequence identity below the ‘twi-
light zone’, with reasonable results (see, for instance, Callebaut
et al., 2006; Engel and Stahlberg, 2002; Patny et al., 2006;
Sansom et al., 2002). This is particularly true for the core
of the TM regions and has inspired new template-based coord-
inate generation protocols for membrane proteins (Kelm et al.,
2010).

This apparent difference between membrane and globular
proteins probably arises because of their different environment.
The lipid bilayer imposes a physical constraint that limits the
number of folds that polypeptide chains can adopt when inserted
in a membrane. These include or-helix bundles in bacterial,
archaeal and eukaryotic cells and ﬁ-barrels in the outer mem-
brane of bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts (Bowie, 2005;
Wimley, 2003). These two folds contain secondary structure
elements that maximize the hydrogen bond interactions among
backbone atoms, whereas hydrophobic side chains are preferen-
tially oriented toward the membrane lipids. As a consequence,
many TM proteins share similar structural arrangements, even
with marginal sequence identities (Gonzalez et al., 2012; Sansom
et al., 2002), suggesting that relatively few conserved residues
are sufﬁcient to determine the molecular architecture of a
particular TM fold.

sequence identity (‘11:)

Fig. 1. Relation between sequence identity and rmsd calculated from the superimposition of the backbone oz-carbon atoms in TM segments of hom-
ologous pairs of membrane proteins, containing both oz-helix bundles (blue) and B-barrels (red). Power functions that ﬁt sequence identity and rmsd for
oz-helix bundles (blue line; y = 36.5xTO‘97, R2: 0.69) and B-barrels (red line; y = 6.6x_0‘53, R2 = 0.72) are also shown. At low-sequence identities, B-barrel

domains seem to have a closer structural similarity than oz-helix bundles

The present study aims to test the hypothesis that computa-
tional structural biologists have been implicitly using when build-
ing homology models of membrane proteins using templates
of low-sequence identity: the fold in membrane proteins is less
dependent on sequence variability than in globular proteins. By
analyzing the relationship between structure and sequence in a
database of membrane protein crystal structures, we show that
fold preservation in the TM region of membrane proteins
requires a lower degree of sequence conservation than in globular
proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Membrane protein dataset

The coordinates of polytopic TM proteins with three or more homolo-
gous structures and resolution <4.0A were obtained from the Protein
Data Bank (Berrnan et al., 2000). Selected proteins were classiﬁed accord-
ing to the SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995) and OPM (Lomize et al., 2006)
databases and include receptors, energy transfer molecules, transporters
and channels from different phyla. The native inactive state (i.e. without
mutations or activating ligands) was selected for those proteins with more
than one structure available. A total of 159 membrane proteins (111
oz-helix bundles and 48 B-barrels) representing 25 different families were
analyzed (Supplementary Table S1). This resulted in a comparison of 432
pairs (250 in oz-heliX bundles and 182 in B-barrels) of homologous TM
protein subunits.

2.2 Determination of the transmembrane region

There exist several methods to annotate the membrane-spanning elements
of TM proteins. We tested the TMDET (Tusnady et al., 2005b) and OPM
(Lomize et al., 2006) algorithms, which yielded similar results when
applied to our dataset. We observed that in the crystal structures of G
protein-coupled receptors, some of the helices that form the TM bundle
extend beyond the presumed boundaries of the membrane toward the
cytoplasm. In such cases, we decided to extend the deﬁnition of TM

segment obtained by TMDET to include these helical regions. To
remove redundancy in our dataset, we selected one of the TM subunits
as representative for homo-multimeric complexes.

2.3 Structural and sequence alignment

A pairwise structure alignment between members of each protein family
was carried out using the Secondary Structure Matching (SSM) algorithm
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2004). From the structural alignments, we
obtained root-mean-square deviations (rmsd) of the backbone oz-carbon
atoms and sequence identity, as the fraction of identical residues in the
total number of (structurally) aligned residues. Structural alignments were
performed separately for either the entire protein (i.e. considering TM
and less structured non-TM segments) or the TM domain.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Relation between sequence and structure in the
transmembrane domains of membrane proteins

Figure 1 and Supplementary Figure S1 show the relation
between sequence identity and rmsd calculated from the pairwise
structure alignments of homologous pairs of polytopic mem-
brane proteins (see Section 2). In the inset, the data are divided
into three categories: pairs of high- (>35%), medium- (20—35%)
and low- (<20%) sequence identity. Clearly, pairs of membrane
proteins with high-sequence identity have highly similar
structures, with rmsd values <1A (0.89:l:0.43A and 0.80:l:
0.32A for oz-helix bundles and ﬂ-barrels, respectively). Protein
pairs with medium sequence identities in the ‘twilight zone’, as
deﬁned for globular proteins (Rost, 1999), also display high-
structural similarity, with rmsd values <2.0A (1.59 :l:0.55A
and l.30:l:0.35 A). Obviously, as sequences diverge, structures
become more dissimilar. However, a large group of protein pairs
with low-sequence identity still maintains a close structural simi-
larity, with rmsd values <3 A (2.69 :l:0.51 A and 2.00 :l:0.34 A).

Fig. 2. Comparison of sequence identity and rmsd for membrane and
globular proteins. The curves ﬁt rmsd and sequence identity values for
entire membrane proteins (in green; y = 17.0x_0‘70, R2 = 0.63) and for TM
segments (in orange; y=10.8x_0‘65, R2=O.61). Both curves are super-
imposed to data for globular proteins represented as contour maps of
the reduced density of probability of obtaining 3D alignments with
the corresponding rmsd (Krissinel and Henrick, 2004). Transmembrane
segments present higher structural similarity (lower rmsd) than globular
proteins at low values of sequence identity (<40%)

These rmsd values do not seem to depend on the number of
transmembrane helices and strands (Supplementary Fig. S2).
These results highlight the strong conservation of the TM fold
even at low-sequence identities. This way, homology models of
TM regions in evolutionary-related proteins sharing low-
sequence identities (<20%) can result in acceptable 3D molecular
models (rmsd < 3 A).

3.2 Comparison of oc-helix and [i-barrel
transmembrane domains

The power curves in Figure 1 ﬁt the data calculated from the TM
domains of oz-helix bundles (blue line) and ﬂ-barrels (red line).
The relation between sequence and structure in these two types
of folds follows slightly different trends for sequence identities
below the twilight zone. Clearly, ﬂ-barrel domains display on
average a closer structural similarity at low-sequence identities
(<30%). Therefore, ﬂ-barrel architectures seem to be more
robust to sequence variations than oz-helix bundles (Williams
and Lovell, 2009).

3.3 Comparison of membrane and globular proteins

Figure 2 shows the relation between sequence identity and rmsd
of membrane protein domains, both or-helix and ﬂ-barrels [con-
sidering only the TM domains, in orange or the entire (TM and
non-TM segments) protein, in green] compared with a contour
map of probability density calculated for globular proteins
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2004). The plot shows that when
considering only TM regions (orange), pairs of membrane pro-
teins display lower rmsd values than pairs of globular proteins,

particularly in the low-residue conservation range (<40%).
Although in globular proteins, or in entire membrane protein
domains (i.e. considering TM- and non-TM segments), a high-
structural similarity (<2 A) requires sequence identities of ~20%
(Chothia and Lesk, 1986; Krissinel and Henrick, 2004), a similar
degree of structural similarity within TM domains can be
achieved with ~10% of sequence identity. This supports the
idea that TM templates of relatively low-sequence identity can
be used for homology modeling of the TM regions of membrane
proteins.

3.4 Comparison of transmembrane and
non-transmembrane segments

Rmsd values calculated from the superimposition of the back-
bone a-carbon atoms of the entire protein domain (containing
both water-exposed and membrane-embedded regions) are on
average larger than the rmsd values calculated exclusively for
the TM segments (Fig. 2). This observation reﬂects the fact
that the structure of membrane-embedded regions is more con-
served than in water-exposed domains. Most probably, the high-
structural conservation of the TM core preserves a conserved
functional mechanism, whereas the variable solvent-exposed re-
gions are responsible for the speciﬁcity of a wide range of extra-
cellular stimuli and comprise loops with non-conserved structure.
Thus, because amino acid substitutions at the TM region have
less inﬂuence in structure than those in solvent accessible regions,
homology modeling of the TM domains can be far more accur-
ate that the outer structural elements (Forrest et al., 2006).

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this work, we have assessed the relation between sequence
identity and structure conservation in a dataset of polytopic
membrane proteins. Our analysis shows that the TM regions
of membrane proteins present a high-structure similarity
(rmsd = 1—2 A) in the twilight zone (20—35% sequence identity).
The degree of structure similarity differs between oz-helix bundles
and ﬂ-barrels (Fig. 1). Comparison of our results with similar
studies in globular proteins (Chothia and Lesk, 1986; Krissinel
and Henrick, 2004; Rost, 1999) shows that the TM region of
membrane proteins presents a higher degree of structural simi-
larity than globular proteins, particularly in the twilight zone
(Fig. 2). Moreover, in contrast to globular proteins, a signiﬁcant
set of membrane proteins maintains a strong conservation of the
TM structure even at low-sequence identity (<20 %). This ﬁnding
suggests that it is possible to obtain relatively accurate 3D
models of the TM regions of membrane proteins by homology
modeling techniques even at low-sequence identities. In this
regard, there are several examples in the literature that support
such applicability (Blattermann et al., 2012; Callebaut et al.,
2006; Engel and Stahlberg, 2002; Patny et al., 2006; Sansom
et al., 2002; Zeth, 2010).

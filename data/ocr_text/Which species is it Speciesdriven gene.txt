ABSTRACT

Motivation: The scientific literature contains a wealth of information
about biological systems. Manual curation lacks the scalability to
extract this information due to the ever-increasing numbers of
papers being published. The development and application of text
mining technologies has been proposed as a way of dealing with
this problem. However, the inter-species ambiguity of the genomic
nomenclature makes mapping of gene mentions identified in text
to their corresponding Entrez gene identifiers an extremely difficult
task. We propose a novel method, which transforms a MEDLINE
record into a mixture of adjacency matrices; by performing a random
walkover the resulting graph, we can perform multi-class supervised
classification allowing the assignment of taxonomy identifiers to
individual gene mentions. The ability to achieve good performance
at this task has a direct impact on the performance of normalizing
gene mentions to Entrez gene identifiers. Such graph mixtures
add flexibility and allow us to generate probabilistic classification
schemes that naturally reflect the uncertainties inherent, even in
literature-derived data.

Results: Our method performs well in terms of both micro-
and macro-averaged performance, achieving micro-F1 of 0.76 and
macro-F1 of 0.36 on the publicly available DECA corpus. Re-curation
of the DECA corpus was performed, with our method achieving 0.88
micro-F1 and 0.51 macro-F1. Our method improves over standard
classification techniques [such as support vector machines (SVMs)]
in a number of ways: flexibility, interpretability and its resistance to
the effects of class bias in the training data. Good performance is
achieved without the need for computationally expensive parse tree
generation or ‘bag of words classification’.

1 INTRODUCTION

The scientiﬁc literature contains a wealth of information
about biological organisms that is relevant for biomedical
scientists: from descriptions of protein—protein interactions (PPIs)

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Hoffmann et al., 2005) to parameters for models of biological
systems (Hakenberg et al., 2004). The ever—increasing publication
rate now means that it has become impossible for manual curators to
extract this information comprehensively. This situation has led to a
sustained interest in the development and application of text mining
(TM) methods to the biological and biomedical domain (Ananiadou
et al., 2006; Harmston et al., 2010).

Many organisms are used to investigate biological processes
and phenomena (Fields and Johnston, 2005) with the expectation
that any understanding obtained can be applied to other organisms
(e.g. the zebraﬁsh immune system is used as a model of the
human immune system). However, in some cases this mapping of
experimental results is not justiﬁed due to inter—species variation (i.e.
a protein may be subject to neo/subfunctionalization), which could
lead to erroneous inferences being drawn. Therefore, it is important
to identify the species to which any genes (and other entities of
interest) mentioned in a paper belong, and in which species the
experiments were performed in order to reduce the chances of this
kind of mistake occurring. Here, we provide a new method that is
able to achieve this automatically embedded in a TM framework.

A typical TM pipeline works by ﬁrst recognizing or tagging named
entities (NEs) of interest (e.g. gene mentions or species mentions)
in a block of text and then normalizing or mapping these mentions
to canonical unique identiﬁers (e. g. Entrez gene identiﬁers or
NCBI Taxonomy identiﬁers). This normalization process facilitates
summarizing and integration of results obtained using TM with
other types of biological knowledge. However, the ambiguity and
variability of the genomic nomenclature makes this task extremely
challenging. A single gene mention can potentially refer to many
genes within a species or across species.

The inter—species ambiguity of the genomic nomenclature (Chen
et al., 2005; Mons, 2005) means that identifying the correct
species of a gene mention is an important subtask of gene
normalization (Hakenberg et al., 2008; Wang and Matthews, 2008),
but despite of this there has been only limited work in this
area. Kappeler et al. (2009) investigated methods to identify the
focal organisms of an abstract using a custom species tagger and
various heuristics. This work showed that identifying the species
mentioned in an abstract was beneﬁcial both for gene normalization
and PPI extraction. Genes from several species can be mentioned
in a single article (e.g. an article on evolutionary analysis of a
gene may refer to its homologues in multiple species) so it is
important to perform species disambiguation at the level of an
individual gene mention. Not performing species—driven gene name
disambiguation led to poor performance in the BioCreative (BC)

Species-driven gene mention disambiguation

 

II PPI extraction task (Krallinger et al., 2008) as gene mentions
participating in interactions were required to be normalized to
identiﬁers from various species. The simplest method to perform
species disambiguation is to assign taxonomy identiﬁers based on
a majority vote, where the most frequent taxonomy identiﬁer in
a document is assigned to all genes in that document. Another
simple way to perform species disambiguation at the document
level is to use the MeSH terms attached to a MEDLINE record.
MeSH is a controlled vocabulary where terms are assigned to new
documents by a team of annotators. However, not all records have
MeSH identiﬁers and there is an implicit assumption of both the
completeness of MeSH vocabulary (with respect to species names)
and the reliability of the manual annotations.

Both the BC 115 (Leitner et al., 2010) and BC III gene
normalization task were concerned with inter—species gene
normalization at the document level. Inter—species gene name
disambiguation is a difﬁcult task, as is evident from the large
difference in performance between the best results reported in the
BC II evaluation (which only looked at identiﬁers from human) and
BC 115. Verspoor et al. (2010) investigated different strategies for
assigning species corresponding to genes mentions, e.g. assigning
gene mentions to a species based on their proximity to species
words, or by considering which species was mentioned ﬁrst in
the document. The publicly accessible GNAT (Hakenberg et al.,
2011) and GeneTUKit (Huang et al., 2011) systems both perform
species—driven gene name disambiguation to achieve high levels of
performance in gene name normalization tasks. Methods which only
look a global features of a document lead to poor performance at the
level of individual mentions. In order to improve performance, the
syntactical/contextual relationship (i.e. co—occurrence in a sentence
or noun phrase) of words suggestive of a certain species with an
individual gene mention needs to be used.

Recently, Wang et al. (2010) produced the freely available
DECA corpus (available for download from http://www.nactem
.ac.uk/decal) allowing the development and evaluation of methods
for species disambiguation at the mention level. The DECA corpus
is an annotated corpus of 636 abstracts from the BC I and BC II
gene normalization tasks, consisting of pairs of gene mentions and
NCBI taxonomy identiﬁers. Gene mentions were identiﬁed using
dictionary—based named entity recognition, and taxonomy identiﬁers
were manually assigned to the identiﬁed mentions by PhD level
biologists. The annotators were only allowed to choose from 10
potential taxonomy identiﬁers (those identiﬁed as the most frequent
based on the BC II Protein Interaction Pairs task (Krallinger et al.,
2008), if the gene mention was found to belong to another species
then it was annotated as ‘Other’. Several methods were proposed
and evaluated (RELATION, ML and HYBRID methods) on this
corpus. A hybrid method combining a syntactic parser with both a
relation and supervised classiﬁcation model was found to have the
best overall performance.

We propose a novel method, which transforms a MEDLINE
record into a mixture of adjacency matrices and by using a random
walkover this mixture model performs multi—class supervised
classiﬁcation (where the potential classes are deﬁned by the contents
of a record). Each class corresponds to a single NCBI Taxonomy
identiﬁer. This method does not require training data for all potential
classes in order to achieve high performance and does not only
perform classiﬁcation but also provides a probability, which serves
to quantify the certainty attached to a classiﬁcation.

2 METHODS
2.1 Preprocessing of the DECA corpus

Two of the abstracts in the original DECA corpus were found to be duplicates
and were removed (corpus A). Error analysis of the results produced by our
method led us to identify several annotation mistakes in the corpus. This
led to extensive manual re—curation of the corpus. Where possible if the
species was proposed in the original corpus as 0 (other species), it was re—
annotated with its correct taxonomy identiﬁer (corpus B). A representative
selection of these re—annotations were checked by another annotator and
found to be correct. This led to a large increase in the number of potential
classes to distinguish between. Statistics regarding the resulting corpora
are provided in Table 1. We evaluated our method on both the original
corpus (with duplicate documents removed) and on the re—annotated version
(Supplementary Material I). Where available, MeSH terms for all abstracts
were obtained from the MEDLINE database. Titles were also obtained from
MEDLINE when they were absent from the original BC corpora.

2.2 Processing pipeline

The resulting text was then split into sentences using the Julie Sentence
Boundary detector (Hahn et al., 2008). After this, shallow parsing using the
GENIA tagger (Tsuruoka et al., 2005) was then performed on these sentences
providing information on the boundaries of noun and verb phrases. We use
the gene mentions provided in the DECA corpus.

As in previous work, we collectively refer to words suggestive of the
species of a gene entity (such as species mentions, cell line mentions, MeSH
terms and preﬁxes) as species words. We evaluate our method using two
different methods for identifying these species words. In order to provide as
fair a comparison as possible to the results in the original DECA paper, we
used the U—Compare (Kano et al., 2009) NaCTeM Species Word Detector in
order to identify species mentions. This component both identiﬁes species
mentions and normalizes them to their corresponding NCBI Taxonomy
identiﬁer. We obtained the mapping used by Wang et al. (2010) in order to
map non—species identiﬁers to species identiﬁers (i.e. allowing the mapping
of mammalian to 9606 and Drosophila to 7227). We denote the use of this set
of species words on corpus A as A1. We also evaluate how the performance
depends on the set of species words used. A custom species word detection
and normalization component was used, which identiﬁes a variety of species
words (species mentions, cell line mentions and MeSH terms) and normalizes
them to NCBI taxonomy identiﬁers. We denote the use of this set of species
words on corpus A as A2.

Species mentions were identiﬁed using the LINNAEUS species tagger
(Gerner et al., 2010) combined with an implementation of the Schwartz and
Hearst algorithm (Schwartz and Hearst, 2003) to identify and disambiguate
abbreviations. Species mentions which were part of experimental methods
mentions were then ﬁltered out (i.e. yeast from yeast two—hybrid method).
Experimental methods were identiﬁed using exact text matching against a
dictionary of experimental methods extracted from the PSIzMI ontology
(Supplementary Material 11). Species mentions were then normalized to

NCBI Taxonomy identiﬁers using dictionary lookup and a set of heuristics
to help handle mentions that mapped to multiple identiﬁers.

One type of species mention that can lead to this problem is the use of a
shortened form of the Linnaean binomial species name (D. miranda) without
the explicit declaration of the long form (Drosophila melanogaster). Authors
may do this when talking about a number of species from the same genus,
the ﬁrst species mention been written with its full Linnaean binomial name,
followed by mentions with an abbreviated genus component of the name.
This observation allows the use of a heuristic where an ambiguous mention
is normalized by using the taxonomic tree. Given an ambiguous mention,
we identify the potential genera it could be associated with and look in
the abstract for any unambiguous mentions with these potential genera. If
only one exists, we propose this to be the genus of the mention and use
this to normalize the species mention to a unique taxonomy identiﬁer e.g.
if an abstract contains mentions of D.melanogaster and D.miranda then
D.miranda would be mapped as Drosophila miranda rather than Diaspis
miranda as Drosophila is the genus of both Drosophila melanogaster and
Drosophila miranda. In the cases where this heuristic could not be applied
and the ambiguous abbreviation potentially referred to a major model
organism (e.g. Caenorhabditis elegans maps to 41 different organisms)
and a long form is not present, then the mention is mapped to the most
probable model organism [Celegans (6239)]. This module was evaluated
on the Linnaeus—100 corpus achieving 0.9683 precision and 0.9606 recall.
When no further rules could be applied to ambiguous mentions, a uniform
probability was assigned to all remaining potential taxonomy identiﬁers.
While this does not decrease the number of ambiguous species mentions
found in the DECA corpus, it does have a large impact on reducing the
number of ambiguous mentions found when normalizing species mentions
tagged in the entire MEDLINE database.

Cell line mentions were tagged using both the ABNER (Settles, 2005) and
the GENIA tagger. These mentions were then mapped to taxonomy identiﬁers
using a manually curated dictionary, which was created by integrating CLKB
(Samtivijai et al., 2008), ATCC, HyperCLDB (Romano et al., 2009), MeSH
ontology and the DMSZ catalogues (Supplementary Material III). If a cell
line mention could be normalized to multiple taxonomy identiﬁers, then the
same probability was assigned to all the potential identiﬁers that the mention
could refer to. MeSH terms from the B subtree of the MeSH ontology were
mapped to taxonomy identiﬁers using exact dictionary matching against the
NCBI taxonomy database (Supplementary Material IV).

Sometimes preﬁxes (e.g. At, Zm, 0s, h, r, m, d, y) are attached to
gene mentions to indicate the species that the gene symbol is referring to.
Typically, this is only allowed by a limited number of journals, and only
to help avoid confusion during cross—species comparisons. Preﬁxes can also
be used to indicate whether the gene mention refers to a mutant version
(e.g. mSos—l) or that it is a ribosomal gene (e.g. rChromatin); these are, of
course, ambiguous with the preﬁx for mouse (m) and rat (r), respectively.
Where possible we distinguish the correct sense of the preﬁx by using the
long form (if present) identiﬁed by the implementation of the Schwartz and
Hearst algorithm.

2.3 Random walks over a mixture of adjacency
matrices

We propose a novel method to solve the species—driven gene name
disambiguation problem by using a random walkover an additive mixture
model of adjacency matrices (Fig. 1). For a speciﬁc document, i, we denote
the set of gene mentions for that document as Mi, the set of species words
associated with that document as N,- and the set of taxonomy identiﬁers
to which the species words in that document can be normalized to as 0i.
We assume that different authors state the species of a gene mention over all
documents in a similar way irrespective of the actual species being proposed.
We represent the relationships between these species words and gene
mentions as a directed bipartite graph, G031), with edges, e 6 E031), from nodes

in M,- to nodes in Ni.

Ly9 is a mouse cell membrane antigen found on all
lymphocytes and coded for by a gene that maps to chromosome

a full—length cDNA clone for mouse Ly9. Using cross—species
hybridization we isolated cDNA clones encoding the human
homologue Humly9. PMID:8537117

Each matrix, AW), represents the adjacency matrix for a speciﬁc
relationship type j in document i (Table 2) and is generated by combining
the entities and information generated by the processing pipeline. An edge
exists between a gene mention (m), species word (n) pair for a speciﬁc feature
(j) if that feature holds for that pair [i.e. J (m,n) evaluates to true]. This is
equivalent to its corresponding entry in Ag? being equal to 1. If m and n are
in the same sentence, then the corresponding entry for adjacency matrix 1 is
1. These are then combined together using an additive mixture model. The
normalization of species mentions to taxonomy identiﬁers is represented by
a different directed bipartite graph, at,

Features are divided into two sets J and K, for use in the two-step and three-step random
walk, respectively. Also shown is the coefﬁcient of variation (CV) for the estimated
parameters on the both versions of the corpus using our custom species word detection
and normalization component (A2 and B).

The union of these two bipartite graphs is then taken, resulting in a tripartite
graph. We deﬁne the union operator on adjacency matrices to give the same
result as a graph join (Harary, 1994) on the graphs they encode,

Add) U30) E God) U50)

2 (Ml-.Nt. 0t.E0‘>.E<">). (6)

The corresponding adjacency matrix is then row—normalized to form a
transition matrix, and random walks of either length 2 or 3 depending on
the adjacency matrix are performed.

For example, an author may refer to mouse Ly9 and then later just
Ly9 while still referring to the mouse version of Ly9. The second term in
Equation (7) allows the transfer of information between gene mentions with
the same surface form. Here the second Ly9 (Fig. 1) can reach identiﬁer
10 090 through a three—step random walk by ﬁrst walking to a previous
mention of Ly9 and then on from there. This allows use of the contextual
information of the previous Ly9 in making a decision about the second
mention. We allow spreading of information in two distinct directions (from
earlier/later mentions to later/earlier mentions).

The two tripartite graphs are then combined with the value at position mo
stating the probability of ending at taxonomy identiﬁer 0 starting from gene
mention m. The probability that a speciﬁc gene mention m is associated with
taxonomy identiﬁer o is given by,

The ﬁrst term in the likelihood equation corresponds to the two—step random
walks through the network and the second term to three—step random walks. A
gene mention is as signed the taxonomy identiﬁer with the highest probability
in its row in the ﬁnal tripartite adjacency matrix. If the maximum value is
not unique (i.e. there is a tie), no classiﬁcation is made. We only allow
edges between gene mentions where they have the same surface form (e. g.
M,- E M). Random walks longer than length 3 are not possible in this network
topology. C1 is the normalization vector for the transition matrix for the two—
step random walk random and Ck is the normalization vector for the transition
matrices for three—step random walk (where each matrix represents a different
direction that the walk can proceed in). Each entry in the normalization vector

is calculated as the reciprocal of the equivalent row sum for each row in A*.
We then can the calculate the likelihood using Equation (7).

The parameters (6*) of the individual components of the mixture model

3 RESULTS

Our method was evaluated using 5—fold cross—validation over the
DECA corpus. We assume that gene mentions are provided and
the aim is to assign a single taxonomy identiﬁer to individual gene
mentions. We calculated the micro—precision, micro—recall, micro—
F1, macro—precision, macro—recall and macro—F1 over the different
versions of the DECA corpus. Precision is calculated as the total
number of correctly assigned gene mention—taxonomy identiﬁer
pairs divided by the total number of assigned pairs. Recall is
calculated as the total number of correctly assigned ‘gene mention—
taxonomy identiﬁer’ pairs divided by the total number of pairs
annotated in the corpus. F1 is the unweighted harmonic mean of
precision and recall. Micro—averaged metrics are calculated globally
over all potential classes. These metrics provide a measure of how
well our method is doing over all the instances in the corpus.
However, training data for multi—classiﬁcation tasks can exhibit a
class bias, where certain classes are over—represented. This can lead
to high micro—averaged performance as the method may work well
on the classes with a large number of instances, but the method may
show poor performance on rarer classes with few or no instances
in the training set. Macro—averaged metrics provide measures where
this class bias is taken into consideration by explicitly assuming
that the class sizes are equal. This is achieved by taking the mean of
the desired performance metric over the potential classes. Methods
that report high micro—average and low macro—average performance
suggest that the method is susceptible to local over—ﬁtting.

Our method performs well compared to the current state—of—the—
art methods reported previously by Wang et al. (2010), in terms of
both macro— and micro—averaged metrics (Table 3). Randomization
testing was performed and the method was found by signiﬁcantly
outperforming the previously reported ML method in terms of
macro—averaged performance and the RELATION method in terms
of both macro— and micro—averaged performance (Table 4).

In comparison to the method in Wang et al. (2010), which only
used a species tagger and preﬁx resolution system, using a different
species tagger and additionally using cell lines and MeSH terms as
extra sources of evidence was found to improve overall performance.
A number of abstracts contain no species mentions and the only clue
with regard to the species is the assigned MeSH terms. If MeSH
terms were not used in the model, the micro—averaged F1 would
decrease to 0.7344 and 0.7572, for corpus A2 and B, respectively [we
note that our method resolves many more species than the method
of Wang et al. (2010) and hence a decrease in micro—averages is
expected]. Not including cell line mentions in the evaluation resulted
in a decrease to 0.8459 and 0.8840 for corpus A2 and B in terms
on F1. This shows that in addition to identifying species names,
using other sources of evidence improves the overall performance.
Our method enables the integration of these additional sources of
evidence in a coherent and easily understandable manner.

We show the performance measures on the individual classes for
A1, A2, B in Tables 5, 6 and 7, respectively. It should be noted that
the method can disambiguate species even when the species has
only a small number of instances in the corpus. High performance is
achieved even when members of a class are absent from the training
data for that fold (as certain classes are only present in one document
in the corpus).

Examination of the parameter estimates over the different folds
shows that they are relatively stable, with most having a small
coefﬁcient of variation (CV) (Table 2). The rank of the parameters

 

is notably similar over all folds (Spearmans ,0 = 0.9621 and 0.9718
for corpus A2 and B, respectively). This shows that the relative
importance of the features is highly consistent over all folds,
supporting the assumption that authors state the species of a gene in
a consistent manner irrespective of the actual species.

4 DISCUSSION

Unlike other classiﬁcation (e. g. SVMs) approaches, our method does
not provide a hard classiﬁcation (‘yes’l‘no’) and instead provides
a probability associated with each classiﬁcation it makes. This
probability reﬂects both the uncertainty in assigning a species word
to a gene mention, and in the normalization of a species word to an
NCBI taxonomy identiﬁer, allowing uncertainty to be propagated.
Thus, the reliability of the proposed species identiﬁer can be assessed
directly, and we do not artiﬁcially inﬂate conﬁdence in a given
classiﬁcation. Where there is insufﬁcient evidence in the abstract
to distinguish between the species of an entity, a Maximum Entropy
(MaxEnt) approach is followed where all potential taxonomy
identiﬁers are assigned a uniform probability (no classiﬁcation is
made). Like the relation method proposed by Wang et al. (2010), our
method does not require separate training data for each class/species
and instead assumes that authors propose the species of an entity in a
uniform manner over all species. The method is conceptually similar
to construction—integration model proposed by Kintsch (1988).

In the absence of any species words, it is not possible to propose
a taxonomy identiﬁer for any gene mentions within that abstract.
In future, it may be possible to use an imputation step where we
could probabilistically assign an identiﬁer based on the frequency of
species in PubMed, or by looking at its candidates in BioThesaurus
(Liu et al., 2006) and assigning a uniform probability over all
potential taxonomy identiﬁers.

The performance of any species disambiguation method is highly
dependent on the performance of the components responsible
for tagging and normalizing species words. Here, we used both
the NaCTeM Species Word Detector and the LINNAEUS tagger
for species named entity recognition (NER), and any publicly
available/custom—built species tagger could be used [e. g. TaxonGrab
(Koning et al., 2005) or the OrganismTagger (Naderi et al., 2011) ].
One of the issues with species name identiﬁcation is that authors can
use the genus name as shorthand for the species name. Performance
of the method would improve if genus names were identiﬁed
and normalized to the major model organism in that genus [e. g.
identifying and normalising Arabidopsis to Arabidopsis thaliana
(3702)]. However, this would require a species tagger capable
of distinguishing whether the genus mention is referring to an

individual species or the genus as a whole in order to not adversely
impact precision.

In cases involving co—ordination (e.g. the human and mouse
KLHLI genes (PMID: 10888605), both elements of the coordination
are assigned to the named entity with similar (but not necessarily
equal) probabilities of being the correct one. In some cases, this
leads to false positives. Unlike the previous work by Wang et al.
(2010), we have not investigated the use of the computationally
expensive syntactic parse trees; however, these could possibly be
used as an additional feature in our model and enable us to handle
coordinated entities. We ﬁnd, however, that good performance can
be achieved without incurring the heavy computational burden of
generating parse trees of sentences in the MEDLINE abstracts. We
believe that in future species disambiguation should be considered
as a multi—label classiﬁcation problem, where a gene mention can
have many taxonomy identiﬁers assigned to it, although it would
require another complete re—curation (and extension) of the DECA
corpus to make this possible. It is not possible to include ‘bag of
words’ style features in the proposed graph mixture model and so
we have not investigated their use here.

The results show that our method attains perfect precision and
recall for some classes and performs poorly for others. Some of the
low incidence species in Table 7 occur in only 1—fold (sometimes in
only one document). Even though the training information for these
speciﬁc classes is non—existent, our method achieves remarkable
performance on some of these classes. The main reason for poor
performance on these low incidence classes is that the evidence
for other classes in an abstract overwhelms the evidence for that
class (i.e. the correct class has a single species word while the
incorrect class has many species words close to the gene mention).
Examination of misclassiﬁcations revealed two situations where our
method can perform poorly: in cases where the abstract describes the
result of a transfection experiment where a gene from one species
is transfected into another species; and when an abstract is talking
about the interactions between viral and host genes, the host species
is implicitly mentioned in the name of the virus and is not identiﬁed
by the species NER component, leading to possible misclassiﬁcation
of host genes as viral genes. Beyond this no systematic sources of
bias were detectable.

In principle, we could also use higher order information in this
task. For example, it has previously been noted that other species
words such as the names of diseases (e. g. Creutzfeldt——Jakob disease
and Li—Fraumeni syndrome) are indicative of human; however,
we leave the identiﬁcation, mapping and evaluation of such clues
for future work. Previous work in gene normalization has found
that examining co—authorship networks (Farkas, 2008) can improve
performance in gene normalization tasks. As researchers would
tend to work on a limited number of organisms during their career
(e.g. ‘researcher A only works on species ‘X ’), it seems that this
information could also be exploited in distinguishing the species
of named entities, but this requires us to identify authors reliably
(which would be simpliﬁed immeasurably by researcher IDs).

5 CONCLUSION

Our method performs well in terms of both macro— and micro—
averaged performance of previous methods and shows signiﬁcant
improvements over the RELATION method proposed by Wang
et al. (2010). Most importantly, our approach, once the reliable

corpora are in place, can be applied in an automatic fashion
without any further user intervention, which will greatly aid its
employment in the context of novel organisms or contexts which
consider broad phylogenetic panels. We are currently integrating
this approach with our TM pipeline (Serendipity) in order to
generate species speciﬁc PPI networks for a variety of organisms
(Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Escherichia coli and for various host—
pathogen interaction/infection networks). The method is quite
generic and could potentially be used for a host of relation
classiﬁcation tasks, such as assigning genes to PATO identiﬁers
using phenotype clues identiﬁed in an abstract potentially allowing
the automatic association of genes to phenotypic information. This
is already a taxing problem for human annotators, but computational
approaches such as proposed here are the only really viable option
in order to cope with the wealth of information being generated in
genomics and systems biology.

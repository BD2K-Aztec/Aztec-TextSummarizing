Abstract

Motivation: Comparing protein tertiary structures is a fundamental procedure in structural biology
and protein bioinformatics. Structure comparison is important particularly for evaluating computa—
tional protein structure models. Most of the model structure evaluation methods perform rigid
body superimposition of a structure model to its crystal structure and measure the difference of
the corresponding residue or atom positions between them. However, these methods neglect in—
trinsic flexibility of proteins by treating the native structure as a rigid molecule. Because different
parts of proteins have different levels of flexibility, for example, exposed loop regions are usually
more flexible than the core region of a protein structure, disagreement of a model to the native
needs to be evaluated differently depending on the flexibility of residues in a protein.

Results: We propose a score named FlexScore for comparing protein structures that consider flexi—
bility of each residue in the native state of proteins. Flexibility information may be extracted from
experiments such as NMR or molecular dynamics simulation. FlexScore considers an ensemble of
conformations of a protein described as a multivariate Gaussian distribution of atomic displace—
ments and compares a query computational model with the ensemble. We compare FlexScore
with other commonly used structure similarity scores over various examples. FlexScore agrees
with experts’ intuitive assessment of computational models and provides information of practical

 

usefulness of models.

1 Introduction

Proteins are intrinsically ﬂexible molecules. Flexibility is essential in
understanding protein activity Where conformational entropy has a
major role, including protein-ligand (Tzeng and Kalodimos, 2012),
protein—protein interactions (Betts and Sternberg, 1999), protein
allostery (Popovych et 61]., 2006), and protein folding.

Although it is conventional to consider a single structure for a pro—
tein particularly When the structure was solved by X—ray crystallog—
raphy, a protein can change its conformation in different
experimental conditions (Andrec et 61]., 2007; Garbuzynskiy et 61].,
2005; Kosloff and Kolodny, 2008). Furthermore, there is compelling
evidence that indicates even X—ray diffraction data contains ﬂexibility
information and that diffraction data can be interpreted into different
conformations (DePristo et 61]., 2004; Kuzmanic et 61]., 2011). Indeed,
a group of structural biologists proposed to deposit an ensemble of

structures even for X—ray crystallography to public databases so that
data represent structural heterogeneity and dynamics more properly
(Furnham et 61]., 2006). Thus, in principle it is more appropriate to
represent a protein structure as an ensemble of alternative conform—
ations (Fenwick et 61]., 2011; Olsson et 61]., 2014). In practice, ﬂexibil-
ity information of a protein can be obtained either from experiments,
such as NMR, or computational analysis including molecular dy-
namics (MD) simulations and normal mode analysis. By bringing
ﬂexibility into the picture of proteins, the protein sequence—to—
structure—to—function paradigm (Fetrow and Skolnick, 1998) must be
revised to sequence—to—structure—to—dynamics—to—function.

Reflecting the current situation that a protein is usually repre—
sented With a single conformation, most of the commonly used pro—
tein structure model evaluation methods compare a model against a
single structure of the protein (‘the native structure’). For example,

the most commonly used dissimilarity measure, the root mean
square deviation (RMSD), quantifies difference of corresponding
positions of two rigid structures after optimal superimposition
(Kabsch, 1978):

rmsd(A,B) :

 

where A and B are the Cartesian coordinates of atoms of two proteins,
A

x,- is the coordinates of atom i in protein A and N is the number of
atom pairs to be compared. In the protein structure prediction field,
measures that are based on RMSD, such as GDT—TS (Zemla, 2003),
TM—score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005), are also used, which all com—
pare two rigid structures. There are other methods that compare dif—
ferent representations of protein structures (Hasegawa and Holm,
2009), but they all belong to the rigid structure comparison realm and
suffer from the same problem of neglecting protein ﬂexibility. In eval-
uating a computational model, neglecting ﬂexibility in the native
structure results in overestimating displacement of residues in the
model at ﬂexible regions and underestimating displacement at rigid re—
gions of the protein. For example, structure difference in a model at a
ﬂexible tail of the protein does not need to be penalized as long as the
tail is modeled within the range of reasonable tail motion. On the
other hand, a displacement of residues in a model at the core of a pro—
tein may be considered as a severe error of the model. Simply superim-
posing a rigid model to the single rigid conformation of the native
structure cannot distinguish these two cases.

Although considering the flexibility is still not common for eval-
uating protein structure prediction models, there have been several
structure comparison methods that consider protein ﬂexibility. In
the simplest form, flexibility can be indirectly represented as weights
assigned to each residue in a pair of protein structures to be com—
pared, where weights are computed from the B—factors in crystallog—
raphy (Wu and Wu, 2010) or theoretical estimates of ﬂuctuation.
Weights can be also computed from the distance of corresponding
residues in the previous round of alignment in iterative computa—
tions of RMSD (Damm and Carlson, 2006). FlexE uses a residue—
level elastic network model and evaluates the difference of two
structures in terms of energetic cost for deforming one structure into
the other (Perez et 61]., 2012).

An alternative strategy is to consider ensembles of protein struc—
tures. Briischweiler proposed a fast computational method for aver—
aging pairwise RMSD of two ensembles (Bruschweiler, 2003). The
Kullback—Leibler divergence was used to quantify the similarity of
two structure ensembles (Lindorff—Larsen and Ferkinghoff-Borg,
2009). An algorithm was developed for specifically aligning struc—
ture ensembles in a MD trajectory, which minimizes the variance of
structures as well as pairwise displacement of structures from adja—
cent time frames (Gapsys and de Groot, 2013). THESEUS
(Theobald and Wuttke, 2006) and bFit (Mechelke and Habeck,
2010) use maximum likelihood to superimpose ﬂexible protein
structures where atom positions are assumed to have Gaussian dis—
tribution. An advantage of these two methods is that they are free of
ad [906 parameters.

Related works include structure alignment algorithms that expli-
citly consider local conformational change in structures caused by
ﬂexibility (Shatsky et 61]., 2002; Ye and Godzik, 2003) and protein
ﬂexible functional site identification (Moll et 61]., 2010; Sael and
Kihara, 2012).

In this work, we propose a score for evaluating quality of protein
structure models by taking flexibility of the native protein structure
into account. The score named FlexScore (FS) quantifies how well

each residue in the query model locates within the displacement
range observed in structure ensemble. Among the existing methods
mentioned above, only FlexE was designed for structure model
evaluation. In contrast to FlexE, which needs parameter setting for
an underlying elastic network model and outputs an energy value to
a model that is not straightforward to interpret, our method does
not need arbitrary parameters and provides an intuitive score that is
easy to compare with conventional structure evaluation scores.

Below we first introduce FS and clarify the characteristics of the
score using illustrative models. Then we compare FS with RMSD,
GDT—TS (Zemla, 2003), and TM—score (Zhang and Skolnick, 2005)
on several computational models. Lastly, FS was applied to evaluate
computational models that were submitted to the Critical
Assessment of Techniques for protein Structure Prediction (CASP;
Moult et 61]., 2014). It is shown that FS provides more reasonable
and complete evaluation for structure models in comparison with
other commonly used structure similarity scores.

2 Methods

We begin with outlining the algorithm of the structure superimpos—
ition method that was used for computing FS and then explain the
dataset of protein models we used.

2.1 Maximum likelihood superimposition of protein
ensembles
First, an ensemble of alternative conformations of a reference struc—
ture (native structure), against which computational models will be
compared, is obtained from MD simulation (details given in the
next section) or an experimental method, e.g. NMR. Then, the en—
semble of conformations is represented as a probabilistic model,
where a probability density function describes each residue Cor atom
displacements from the ensemble mean. A probabilistic model is
defined using structure superimposition by maximum likelihood es-
timation on the multivariate Gaussian model (Hirsch and Habeck,
2008; Mechelke and Habeck, 2010; Rother et 61]., 2008). We used
the framework of THESEUS for this ensemble superimposition, as it
properly considers variance and correlations of atoms in the struc—
tures in an explicit fashion. Below we briefly outline the algorithm.
For more details refer to the original paper (Theobald and Wuttke,
2006).

The coordinates of a structure X,- in an ensemble can be repre—
sented as

x,- = (M + E,)R,T — 1H? (2)

using a mean structure M, a zero—mean Gaussian matrix displace—
ment E,- that follows a Gaussian distribution of Nk,3(0, 2, I3), where
Z is a k X [a covariance matrix where k is the number of Car atoms in
the structure, a rotation matrix R,, a 3 X 1 translational vector ti,
and a k X 1 column vector of ones. T denotes transpose of a matrix.
As commonly used in Bayesian analysis, eigenvalues of the covari—
ance matrix are assumed to be distributed according to an inverse
Gamma distribution, which is defined with a parameter or.

According to this multivariate Gaussian error model of the na—
tive state ensemble, the parameters can be iteratively estimated by
optimizing the following log-likelihood function:

1r, = 1(R, t, M, aIX, 2) = 1(R, t,M, XIX) + Imp) <3)

This is called a hierarchical model, which combines the log—
likelihood that comes directly from Equation (2) (first term) and the
log-likelihood of an inverse Gamma distribution, where i are

eigenvalues of Z. X is the ensemble that contains 11 structures. The
parameters are estimated iteratively, given X and an initial value of
estimated covariance, :3 = I and or = 0.

First, t, M, and R are estimated iteratively. It is shown that the
translation t can be estimated as

T —1
2,=_M (4)

1,3241,a
Hat (A) denotes an estimated value. The rotation matrix R is
derived by single value decomposition (SVD) of
MTZ_1 X,- —l— 1k}? . The mean structure M is computed as the
average of the translated/rotated ensemble structures coordinates.
Then, the covariance matrix can be estimated as usual:

:5=2i<<Xi+12>Ri—M><<xi+1ka:>Ri—M>T <s>
i=1

Here 25 denotes the sample covariance matrix that is computed
for the first term in the right hand side of Equation (3). Next, at of
the inverse Gamma distribution and the eigenvalues 2 are estimated
iteratively by solving

and

a = k <7)

k—m

where :3], is the estimated covariance matrix of the hierarchical
model, the left side of Equation (3), m is the number of missing
eigenvalues, E(25_n1|oc,y,c) is the expected value of the inverse of the
m smallest missing eigenvalues conditional on the smallest observed
eigenvalue 6, y is the shape parameter of the inverse Gamma distri—
bution, which is set to 0.5. Once or and :3], are updated, t, M, and R
are again updated and iterations continue until convergence.

2.2 FlexScore

Given the estimated covariance matrix :3], and the ensemble mean
M, it is possible to superimpose a protein structure model to the en—
semble, which was not primarily included in the original ensemble.
Consider a computational protein structure model Y. Y contains the
amino acid sequence identical to the reference protein structures, X.
Using :3], and M the translation vector and the rotation matrix for
Y can be computed by applying Equation (4) for the translation vec—
tor and by SVD of MT:;1 (Y —l— 1k}? for the rotation matrix.

After translation and rotation of Y, we define FlexScore, FS, as

Ms

FS(Y) 2%

H
H

where 2, is the eigenvalue of the covariance matrix 2],, thus vari—
ance of Car atom i and qup is the position of Car atom 1' after super—
imposition. FS has a simple interpretation: how far, on average,
residue positions of the computational model are to the native state
ensemble in standard deviations units. The best score of 0 is ob—
tained for a model if the model has the identical conformation as the
mean. As a model deviates from the mean structure, the score will
be larger.

2.3 Protein native—state ensembles

An ensemble of native structures of a target protein was constructed
by a MD simulation. A 10—ns—long MD simulation of the native state
of a target protein was performed with bound ligands and ions with
explicit water representation using a structure deposited in the
Protein Data Bank (PDB). 1 MD run is sufficient because as shown
in Supplementary Figure S1, ﬂexibilities observed in independent
MD trajectories are usually consistent with each other. Selenium
atoms in selenomethionine residues were replaced with Sulphur.
NMR—solved protein structures were simulated using the first model
in the PDB files. The force field used for simulations was AMBER-
99SB"‘ with a NVT system. For details of the simulations, see a
Supplementary Material in a paper by Hospital et al. (2012). From a
simulation trajectory, we extracted structure at each 10 picoseconds
to form an ensemble of structures.

2.4 Computational protein models

We chose 10 CASP 10 and 18 CASP11 targets as follows, which
meet the following criteria for applying and evaluating FS: (i) mono—
mers; (ii) no missing residues in the middle of chains in the PDB file;
(iii) does not contain ligands for which force—field are not developed
yet. For these targets, we analyzed server models with a complete
chain. The number of models for each target ranged from 201 to
257 (average: 224.9). For the CASP11 targets, 10 ‘template—based
modeling’ and 8 ‘free—modeling’ where chosen. The number of mod—
els for CASP11 targets ranged from 163 to 191 (average 175.5).

2.5 Conventional scores

FS was compared with RMSD (Equation (1)) and two widely used
model evaluation scores, GDT—TS (Zemla, 2003) and TM—Score
(Zhang and Skolnick, 2005). GDT—TS is the average of fraction of
residues in a model that are predicted within 1, 2, 4, and 8  after
superimposing the model to a reference structure of the protein.
TM—Score is also a fraction of residues in a model that are closer
than a heuristic cutoff value to corresponding residue positions after
superimposing the model to a reference structure. Thus, both scores
range from 0 to 1, with 1 as the best score.

3 Results

3.1 FS for two example structures

To illustrate characteristics of FS, we made two structure models for
the C—terminal domain (residue 529—5 77) of human CSTF—64 pro—
tein (PDB ID: 2j8p). From the first structure model of this protein in
its PDB file (this protein was solved by NMR), two models were
built by manual modification, which have identical RMSD, GDT-
TS, and TM—Score values (1.47, 0.95, and 0.93, respectively) be—
tween each other. The first model (shown in green in Fig. 1A) was
modified at a helical region (residues 550—554), while the second
model (shown in blue) was modified at the C—terminal fragment
(residue 573—5 77). Referring to the structure ensemble of this pro—
tein (all NMR models in the PDB file) shown in gray in the figure,
the second model (blue) would be better than the first one in green
because the deviation of the blue model at the C—terminus is still in
the range of observed structure variation. In contrast to the existing
scores that give the same quality evaluation to the two models, FS
gave clear distinction between these models: the first model had FS
: 1.96, and the second model had FS : 1.42. Figure 1B shows the
variance of the NMR ensemble, and the deviation of the two models
from the mean structure, and FS computed at each residue. It is clear
that the deviated helical region in the first model was appropriately

3.2 FS for structure models
Next, we computed FS for structure models of the 28 CASP targets
and compared the scores with RMSD, GDT—TS, and TM—Score.
Table 1 summarizes correlation of the FS and the other three scores.
Overall, FS correlated well for most of the cases with GDT—TS,
TM—Score, and RMSD. Because the smaller the better for FS, it has
positive correlation with RMSD while negative with GDT—TS and
TM—Score. However, there are exceptions, T0651, T780, T0808,
T0814, and T0853, where FS has a strong correlation to RMSD
while essentially no correlation with GDT—TS and TM—Score. In
these cases, the quality of all the models is low as can be seen in the
average score values in Table 1. Some models have long unphysical,
totally stretched regions, which made their RMSD large. These bad
regions of a model were severely penalized in RMSD and FS, which

made their correlation high with each other but the correlation to
GDT—TS and TM—Score low, because such regions were neglected by
these two scores.

Table 1 shows that RMSD has the largest correlation among the
three scores with FS. However, RMSD and FS have substantially
lower correlation for T0655, T0675, T0716, T0769, and T0773
(Fig. 2A). This is owing to the flexible nature of these target pro—
teins, which was shown in Figure 2B. Compared with a rigid target
structure T0714 shown in Figure 2B for which FS has a correlation
coefficient of 0.98 with RMSD, these three targets have one or two
ﬂexible regions. Because RMSD optimizes non—weighted (homosce—
dastic) mean deviation in comparing a model and a reference struc—
ture, it results in overestimating error for such flexible proteins,
which makes a lower correlation with FS. Note that as shown in
Supplementary Table S1, overall correlation between GDT—TS and
TM-Score is slightly higher than that of between FS and RMSD.
Correlation between the scores for invididual targets are provided in
Supplementary Figure S2, where differences between FS and RMSD
are observed in many targets.

We have also examined score correlation separately for template—
based (TB) targets and free modeling (FM) targets ("' in Table 1).
Naturally, the quality of computational models are higher for TB
targets (i.e. higher GDT—TS, TM—Score, and lower RMSD values)
than FM targets, because the latter are more difficult to model. For
the TB targets, FS showed high correlation to RMSD and had mod—
erate correlation to GDT—TS and TM—Score (0.488 and 0.513,

Fig. 2. Correlation of FS and RMSD. (A) Correlation coefficient between FS
and RMSD relative to the average standard deviation of C01 atoms of ensem-
ble structures. (B) The flexibility of four target proteins, T0716, T0714, T0675
and T0655. The standard deviation of each Cor atoms is shown. T0714 is an ex-
ample of rigid structures for comparison

respectively). For FM targets, the correlation to the GDT—TS and
TM—Score dropped substantially to a low level (0.143 and 0.219)
while the correlation to the RMSD became even higher for FM tar—
gets (0.93 and 0.99, respectively).

We now discuss some examples of models that have inconsistent
relative scores by FS with RMSD, GDT—TS or TM—Score. The first
examples are models of T0716 (Fig. 3). For this target, FS has over—
all sufficient correlation to the other three scores (Fig. 3A), 0.88
with RMSD, and —0.82 and —0.79 with GDT—TS and TM—Score.
However, there are notable differences that deserve attention. There
are models with similar FS between 2.5 and 4 but have diverse
RMSD values that range between 4 and 8  (the right panel in
Fig. 3A). Figure 3B shows superimposition of two such models rela—
tive to the ensemble structures generated by MD. These two models
in green and orange have largely different RMSDs of 3.93  and
5.40  while with similar FS s of 2.75 and 2.71, respectively.

 

 

Fig. 3. Score comparison of models for T0716. (A) Score correlation of FS
with GDT-TS, TM-Score and RMSD (left to right). The correlation coefficient
between the two score was —0.82, —0.79, and 0.88, respectively.
(B) Superimposition of two models (green and orange) for T0716 onto MD-
derived structural ensemble (thin lines). Both models have a similar FS (2.75
and 2.71), GDT TS (0.75 and 0.73) and TM-Score (0.72 and 0.70), but distin-
guishable RMSD (3.93 A and 5.40 A, respectively). (C) Superimposition of an-
other pair of models for T0716. They have similar GDT-TS (0.52 and 0.51 for
green and orange) and TM-Score (0.48 and 0.49), but have substantially dif-
ferent FS of7.4 and 24.1, respectively

As Figure 3B shows, the target protein is ﬂexible in its N— and C—ter—
minus. Considering the flexible regions of the protein, the quality of
both models are essentially the same, because the core region of the
two models is modeled correctly and the tail region is within the
ensemble.

The second pair of models (Fig. 3C) has a similar GDT—TS score
of 0.52 (green) and 0.51 (orange) but has different FS of 7.4 and
24.1, respectively (the left panel, Fig. 3A). As the figure shows, al—
though the two models share common structures with the crystal
structure at the middle part of the protein (the left side in the figure),
the green model has a better agreement of the topology to the struc—
ture ensemble. The orange model has long—stretched helices in both

Fig. 4. Score comparison of models for T0655. (A) Score correlation of FS
with GDT-TS, TM-Score and RMSD (left to right). The correlation coefficient
between the two score was —0.83, —0.88 and 0.77, respectively.
(B) Superimposition of two models (green and orange) for T0655 onto MD-
derived structural ensemble (thin lines). Both models have a similar GDT-TS
score (0.50 and 0.54), and TM-Score (0.61 and 0.66), but they have different
FS (23.05 and 9.2, respectively)

chain termini, which largely disagree with the reference structure en—
semble. Reﬂecting these characteristics of the two models, FS for the
green model is substantially better than the orange model (7.4 for
the chain in green and 24.1 for the chain in orange).

The next examples are for the target T065 5 (Fig. 4). Looking at
the score correlation in Figure 4A, there are a cluster of models that
have a GDT—TS score around 0.5 or TM—Score of 0.6. FS, in con—
trast, distinguishes the quality of these models with a diverse range
of score values. Figure 4B shows such examples. The two models in
Figure 4B capture correct ﬂ—class fold in the middle of the protein.
The green model has totally unstructured tails that are far off from
the structure ensemble of its reference structure, which is reﬂected in
a substantially worse FS of 23.05 than the orange one (9.2). This
quality difference can be also detected by RMSD (25.93  and 7.28
A, respectively, for the green and the orange model); however, the
structure alignments computed for the green model by the FS and
the RMSD computation are different (Supplementary Fig. S3).
RMSD of the core region of the green model (residue 22—142) by FS
computation was 4.01 A, while the RMSD superimposition gave 17.
22  Thus, considering the ensemble helped making better align—
ments in the FS case.

The last example is from the target T0714 (Fig. 5). These two
models have similar GDT—TS (0.84 and 0.83 for the green and the
orange model, respectively), and similar TM—Score (0.83 and 0.86,
respectively). We also computed GDT—HA score for these models,
which was 0.64 and 0.61, respectively. In contrast, FS indicates that
the orange model, which has a score of 2.69 has a better quality
than the green one, which has a score of 4.42. This is a reasonable
evaluation considering the larger number of incorrect regions in the
green model that are off from the ensemble structures (indicated
with blue circles in the figure).

3.3 FS using NMR ensemble
In Figure 6, we compared FS computed using a MD—generated en—
semble and an NMR—derived ensemble. The two scores are

0.84 and 0.83, and TM-Score of 0.83 and 0.86, respectively. FS of the two
models are 4.42 and 2.69, for the green and the orange models, respectively

3.4 Ranking prediction groups in CASP models

In the last section, we examine how performance of prediction
methods are ranked among peers with FS. For this experiment, we
used the 10 CASP10 targets selected in Section 2.4. There were 68
groups who submitted server models to at least one of these 10 tar—
gets in CASP10, who were subject to the analysis. In CASP, a group
can submit up to five models for a target, but here only the first
models (TS1 model) were evaluated. Ranking of the groups with FS
was compared with those by three other scores, GDT—TS, TM-
Score, and RMSD.

For this comparison, we devised another score named FS—GDT
based on FS, which follows the concept of GDT—TS. Similar to the
GDT—TS that counts the fraction of C01 positions that fall within 1,
2, 4 and 8  to the corresponding positions in the reference structure
after superimposition, FS—GDT computes the average fraction of
residues (Cor positions) that have FS within 1, 2, 4, and 8.

Ranking of the groups was determined by the accumulated
Z—score in the same way as performed for the official CASP rank-
ings: (i) For a target, Z—scores from a raw score were computed for
all TS1 models. (ii) Then, bad models with a Z—score of —2.0 or
lower were removed as outliers. (iii) Z—scores were recalculated
without the outliers; (iv) and finally, each group accumulates the
Z—score from the previous step from each target. Table 2 shows the
group ranking results up to the top 10 groups. Because the purpose
of ranking groups is not to decide who did well and who did not but
to examine similarity of ranking by different scores, the group iden—
tities are denoted with alphabets.

Overall the group ranking by FS and FS—GDT correlated well
with GDT—TS, TM—Score, and RMSD. In Table 2, Group A was
consistently ranked the top by all the scores and every pair of scores
shares at least four groups among the top 5 ranked groups by the
scores. The Spearman’s correlation coefficients between rankings by
FS and FS—GDT against the other three existing scores are all
high, all over 0.9 except for the FS—GDT and RMSD pair (0.806)
(Table 3A). Correlation between FS and FS—GDT with the other

scores is also high when the sum of the Z—scores used to rank the
groups were compared (Table 3B). Thus, while FS provides alterna—
tive evaluation to structure models by reasonably considering pro-
tein ﬂexibility (Section 3.1 and 3.2), evaluation is close and
consistent with the other existing scores when it comes to ranking of
groups.

Equivalent data to Tables 2 and 3 for the CASP11 targets are
provided in Supplementary Material (Supplementary Tables S3 and
S4), which consistently show strong correlation between group
rankings by different scores.

4 Discussion

We proposed a new score named FS and its variant, FS-GDT, which
evaluates the quality of computational protein structure models by
considering ﬂexibility of protein chains. FS effectively distinguishes
deviations of a model from a reference structure at intrinsically flex-
ible and rigid regions, and assigns more permissive scores to the for—
mer than the latter. This is reasonable from the biophysics
perspective of protein structures.

The ﬂexibility of a protein was measured from a MD simulation
of 10 ns because it was long enough to observe large ﬂexibility in
protein terminal regions and to highlight incorrect regions of struc—
ture models that are beyond the range of chain ﬂexibility. For a
CASP11 model, T0733, we extended the MD run to 100 ns, but FS
did not show meaningful change (Supplementary Table S2 and Fig.
S4). The framework provided here is valid in principle with any data
of protein ﬂexibility, and FS would provide reasonable evaluation to
these models under the provided flexibility information.

We point out that MD simulations are easier to perform than it
used to be, for example by using web—based MD tools (Hospital
et al., 2012; Lee et al., 2016). Previously, we developed a method
named FlexPred, which predicts absolute values of residue fluctu—
ation from a tertiary structure (i.e. a PDB file) of a target protein
(Jamroz et al., 2012), which can be also used to obtain ﬂexibility.

At this juncture, it would be of interest to discuss difference of
using MD simulations and using B—factors as the source of ﬂuctu—
ation. As mentioned in Introduction, the work by Wu 8C Wu intro-
duced a B—factor weighted RMSD (2010). First of all, the level of
ﬂuctuation considered are different between them. B—factors indicate
discrepancy of a solved structure to the X—ray diffraction pattern of
the protein. Thus, although the B—factors were shown to have correl—
ation to residue ﬂexibility observed in computational simulation
(Haliloglu and Bahar, 1998), it is ﬂexibility in the crystal condition
of proteins. It was shown that B—factors are appropriate measure of
ﬂuctuations for stable parts of proteins, but significantly underesti—
mate motion in flexible regions (Eastman et al., 1999). In contrast,
MD used in FS is aimed at considering flexibility of proteins in solu-
tion, which is a more natural environment for proteins. From a tech—
nical stand point, to use B—factors for ﬂexibility value, a weight
parameter needs to be arbitrarily selected because B—factors do not
provide absolute values of ﬂexibility (Wu and Wu, 2010). Also in
FS, flexibility is used more explicitly in the structure superimposition
step than the B—factor weighted RMSD.

The results in the prediction group ranking shows that FS is in
reasonable agreement with the other existing scores. In recent
rounds of the CASP experiments, computational models are eval—
uated with a combination of several scoring terms that examine dif-
ferent structural aspects of models (Kim and Kihara, 2015; Moult
et al., 2014). Combined with other scores, FS will be able to provide
a new viewpoint to the protein structure evaluation. The technique

of considering ensemble structures will be also useful for various
other related problems including multiple protein structure align—
ment, ﬂexible protein—protein or protein—ligand docking, flexible
structure fitting to electron microscopy density maps.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present SVDetect, a program designed to identify
genomic structural variations from paired-end and mate-pair next-
generation sequencing data produced by the Illumina GA and
ABI SOLiD platforms. Applying both sliding-window and clustering
strategies, we use anomalously mapped read pairs provided by
current short read aligners to localize genomic rearrangements
and classify them according to their type, e.g. large insertions—
deletions, inversions, duplications and balanced or unbalanced inter-
chromosomal translocations. SVDetect outputs predicted structural
variants in various file formats for appropriate graphical visualization.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation of genomic structural variations is a key step
in understanding human genetic diversity and evolution as well
as disease etiology. Numerous genetic diseases, including cancer,
have been associated with structural variants (SVs; Futreal et al.,
2004). Although array—based techniques have been successful in
many studies for detecting SVs, the relatively low resolution in
the detection of breakpoints and the characterization of small
SVs remained challenging. With the arrival of high—throughput
sequencing technologies such as the Illumina Genome Analyzer or
the Applied Biosystems SOLiD system, using short—insert paired—
end or mate—paired reads (referred here as paired—ends) has improved
our ability to detect SVs (Korbel et al., 2007). With a priori
information from paired—ends such as order, orientation and insert
size of pairs as constraints during read alignment to the reference
genome, anomalously mapped pairs indicate potential genomic
variations from the reference. The need for algorithms speciﬁcally
designed for SV prediction from paired—end mapping (PEM) data has
recently led to the development of new software packages, including

GASV (Sindi et al., 2009), BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009) and
others (see review, Medvedev et al., 2009).

Here, we present a new freely available program called SVDetect
for SV detection and type prediction from PEM data. SVDetect
identiﬁes different types of SVs, e. g. large insertions—deletions and
inversions, with both clustering and sliding—window strategies, and
helps to visualize them at the genomic scale. Compared to other
tools, the novelty of our method consists in its multiple ability
to: (i) analyze both paired—end and mate—pair sequencing data;
(ii) use unique PEM constraints to improve SV detection; (iii) predict
various types of tandem duplication and to distinguish between
balanced and unbalanced rearrangements; (iv) compare SVs across
multiple samples; (v) construct copy number proﬁles; and (vi) create
various output ﬁle formats for graphical views of SV.

2 METHODS

The ﬁrst step in SVDetect is to regroup all pairs that are suspected to
originate from the same SV. The input consists of paired—ends mapped to the
reference genome, so that either the orientation of pairs is incorrect and/or the
distance between them is out of the typical range. Starting from a list of such
paired—end anomalous mapping, SVDetect uses a sliding—window strategy to
identify all groups of pairs sharing a similar genomic location. The reference
genome is divided into overlapping windows of ﬁxed size, and each pair of
windows can possibly form a link if at least one pair anchors them by its ends
(Fig. 1A). To each link connecting two genomic fragments, we assigned a
certain number of features, such as chromosomal location, number of pairs,
orientation and order of the involved paired—ends. After removing redundant
links, these features are further used in the ﬁltering step to call clusters of
anomalous paired—end reads and detect the type of corresponding SVs.

The ﬁltering procedure of SVDetect takes as input all links previously
identiﬁed and uses user—deﬁned ﬁltering parameter values to call PEM
clusters. The minimum number of paired—ends is one of the most important
ﬁltering parameters to call a cluster. Use of such a threshold improves
conﬁdence in the detection of SVs. Another option is ﬁltering of pairs
whose ends are not oriented in the same way as the ends of the majority
of pairs in the two linked regions. If one of the two ends of remaining pairs
has an unexpected strand orientation, the cluster is annotated as a potential
inversion. The order of paired—ends is used to annotate an inter—chromosomal
cluster both as a balanced or an unbalanced translocation, and to estimate a
genomic coordinate range of predicted breakpoints (the resolution depending
on the insert size). To achieve this goal, SVDetect ﬁlters out any pair for
which the order of a read and its mate is inconsistent with the majority of
pairs in the cluster. The read order is also used to characterize balanced SV
affecting only one chromosome, e.g. to predict the two breakpoints of an

inversion (see Supplementary Material for details of PEM signatures and the
order ﬁltering procedure).

Constraints on the distance between mapped ends in a pair are used
to ﬁlter intra—chromosomal PEM clusters when calling insertion—deletion
events. Assuming the normality of insert size distribution of aligned reads,
we generally use 2 to 3SD from the mean insert size to detect potential
deletions and insertions. The mean insert size for pairs in a called cluster is
then provided. By combining the information about strand, order and insert
size of paired—end reads for each cluster, the type of rearrangement can be
predicted. Lastly, predicted SVs coming from multiple paired—end datasets
can be compared to identify common or sample—speciﬁc variants.

SVDetect provides additional functionality to analyze paired—end
coverage complementary to the previously described strategy, to improve SV
characterization. From all pairs correctly mapped with the expected insert
size, we calculate the log—ratio of depth—of—coverage between a sample and
a control dataset in a sliding window along the genome. This ratio is used
to characterize copy—number proﬁles by identifying potential loss or gain
events, and can be compared to the previously predicted SV positions.

SVDetect offers different output formats to facilitate the subsequent
analysis of reported paired—end clusters. Data conversion to the BED format
or the Circos link format (Krzywinski et 01., 2009) is available for the
graphical representation of pairs and/or copy—number proﬁles (Fig. 1B).
A user—deﬁned color—code related to the number of pairs can be chosen for
better visualization of potentially signiﬁcant SVs.

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the use of SVDetect, we tested the program to
predict SVs from two different types of mate—pair sequencing data:
Illumina GAII 50 bp reads of neuroblastoma cell lines, and Applied
Biosystems SOLiD v2 25 bp reads of a wild—type and mutant pif] A
strains in yeast. First, from 2070 anomalous Illumina read pairs in
the chromosome arms Sq and 11p, we found 37 clusters speciﬁc to
the neuroblastoma sample compared with a reference sample. Only

one signiﬁcant cluster (seven pairs) suggests an inter—chromosomal
SV, predicted to be an unbalanced translocation that is also supported
by the corresponding copy—number proﬁle (Fig. 1B). Close to the
predicted breakpoint location in Sq, we found an intra—chromosomal
cluster predicted to be an inverted duplication, suggesting a more
complex genome rearrangement. The yeast mate—paired datasets
were used to compare SVDetect with the variant detection tool
GASV. From approximately 1 million of aberrantly mapped read
pairs in the wild—type and mutant strains, both tools retrieved all ﬁve
known SVs in the mutant strain. With respect to GASV, the speciﬁc
ﬁltering procedures introduced by SVDetect discard hypothetical
rearrangements supported with inconsistent orientation or order of
their read pairs (see Supplementary Material for tool comparison
and data analysis).

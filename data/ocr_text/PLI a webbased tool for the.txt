ABSTRACT

Motivation: A large fraction of the entries contained in the Protein
Data Bank describe proteins in complex with low molecular weight
molecules such as physiological compounds or synthetic drugs. In
many cases, the same molecule is found in distinct protein-ligand
complexes. There is an increasing interest in Medicinal Chemistry in
comparing protein binding sites to get insight on interactions that
modulate the binding specificity, as this structural information can
be correlated with other experimental data of biochemical or physio-
logical nature and may help in rational drug design.

Results: The web service protein-ligand interaction presented here
provides a tool to analyse and compare the binding pockets of hom-
ologous proteins in complex with a selected ligand. The information is
deduced from protein-ligand complexes present in the Protein Data
Bank and stored in the underlying database.

1 INTRODUCTION

About one fourth of the entries deposited with the Protein Data
Bank (PDB; Dutta et al., 2009) represent proteins in complex
with small molecules (not including common salts and com-
pounds commonly used in molecular and structural biology).
The number of these ligands, in the PDB referred to as hetero-
geneous compounds, is currently ~14 000. Binding speciﬁcity is
achieved by the formation of a network of interactions between
the protein and the ligand, which depends on the shape and on
the physicochemical nature of the amino acids forming the bind-
ing pocket, as well as on structure flexibility of both ligand and
protein. In particular, ~17% of the ligands present in the PDB
are found in complex with distinct proteins. The proteins
involved may either share homology with each other or belong
to distinct families. In the ﬁrst case, it is possible to establish a
relationship of structural equivalence among the amino acids
forming the binding pockets; this allows to analyse the residue

conservation and to identify interactions with the ligand, which
are maintained despite mutated residues. If the proteins belong
to distinct structural families, it might still be useful to compare
the amino acid composition of the distinct binding pockets and
the involved protein-ligand interactions. In the current release of
the PDB database, a total number of 1593 ligands are found in
complexes with at least two homologous proteins (adopting a
maximum value of 95% identical residues to avoid similar or
just point-mutated proteins), and 1049 are found in complex
with at least two unrelated proteins. The PLI database and the
associated web server described here have been developed to
provide an easily usable tool to compare the binding pockets
interacting with a selected ligand as observed in experimentally
determined PDB protein complexes.

2 METHODS

The web tool is based on an underlying database, which is updated regu-
larly with an automated procedure to include new PDB entries and het-
erogeneous compounds. For each heterogeneous compound, identiﬁed in
the PDB with a Het_id code, the list of PDB entries that contain the
compound is obtained from the PDBsum website (Laskowski et al.,
2005). To avoid the inclusion of small molecules having low speciﬁcity
and therefore high frequency of occurrence, only ligands found in a max-
imum number of 25 PDB entries are included in the database. This re-
sulted in the exclusion of ~3% of the entries (412 instances on the current
PDB release). Owing to intrinsic complexity, also the instances with bind-
ing pocket located at the proteinzprotein interface or those with the ligand
not in direct contact with protein atoms (e.g. in the presence of a cluster
of ligands) are not included in the database. The current database in-
cludes 9372 distinct ligands, of which 574 classiﬁed as Drugs according to
KEGG and DrugBank (Kaneisha et al., 2012; Knox et al., 2001). The
data acquisition and processing, repeated for each ligand, consist in four
steps. In the ﬁrst step, the PDB entries associated with the speciﬁc ligand
are sorted in homologous families (Fig. la). In the second step, for each
PDB entry, the amino acids in interaction with the bound ligand are
deduced from the LigPlot output of PDBsum Wallace 61 al., 1995).
The third step is carried out on each group of homologous proteins
identiﬁed in step one: the pair-wise sequence alignments deduced from
the SAS section of PDBsum are used to identify the structurally equiva-
lent amino acids of the binding pockets (Fig. lb). The fourth step consists
of computing, for each pair of homologous protein structures, the degree
of conservation of the binding pocket residues. This value is then com-
pared with the overall amino acid conservation to identify putative evo-
lutionary constraints involving binding pocket residues (Fig. lc; see
supplementary materials for details).

3 RESULTS

Drug design and lead optimization often rely on information
obtained by structural biology methods; this information may
integrate that obtained with other approaches such as those
used to generate pharmacophore models (e.g. Ortuso et al.,
2006). In spite of the abundant, and rapidly growing, structural
information in the PDB describing the interaction of ligands
with distinct target proteins, there is a substantial lack of tools
for the comparison of the binding pockets of homologous
proteins not requiring the use of programs of structural

superposition and signiﬁcant expertise in the ﬁeld of structural
biology. Furthermore, the structural superposition and com-
parison becomes rapidly time-consuming if the number of hom-
ologous protein-ligand complexes exceeds four. The PLI
web service provides and aids to carry out this comparison
(see Fig. 1).

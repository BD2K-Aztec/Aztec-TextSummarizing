ABSTRACT

Motivation: In silica prediction of drug-target interactions plays an
important role toward identifying and developing new uses of existing
or abandoned drugs. Network-based approaches have recently
become a popular tool for discovering new drug-target interactions
(DTIs). Unfortunately, most of these network-based approaches can
only predict binary interactions between drugs and targets, and infor-
mation about different types of interactions has not been well ex-
ploited for DTI prediction in previous studies. On the other hand,
incorporating additional information about drug-target relationships
or drug modes of action can improve prediction of DTIs.
Furthermore, the predicted types of DTIs can broaden our understand-
ing about the molecular basis of drug action.

Results: We propose a first machine learning approach to integrate
multiple types of DTIs and predict unknown drug-target relationships
or drug modes of action. We cast the new DTI prediction problem into
a two-layer graphical model, called restricted Boltzmann machine, and
apply a practical learning algorithm to train our model and make pre-
dictions. Tests on two public databases show that our restricted
Boltzmann machine model can effectively capture the latent features
of a DTI network and achieve excellent performance on predicting
different types of DTIs, with the area under precision-recall curve up
to 89.6. In addition, we demonstrate that integrating multiple types of
DTIs can significantly outperform other predictions either by simply
mixing multiple types of interactions without distinction or using only
a single interaction type. Further tests show that our approach can
infer a high fraction of novel DTIs that has been validated by known
experiments in the literature or other databases. These results indicate
that our approach can have highly practical relevance to DTI predic-
tion and drug repositioning, and hence advance the drug discovery
process.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drug development currently remains an expensive and time-con-
suming process with extremely low success rate: it typically takes
10—15 years and $800 million—1 billion to bring a new drug to
market (Dimasi, 2001). In recent decades, the rate of the number
of new drugs approved by the US Food and Drug
Administration versus the amount of money invested in pharma-
ceutical research and development has signiﬁcantly declined
(Booth and Zemmel, 2004). This productivity problem has

urged drug developers to seek new uses for existing or aban-
doned drugs (Booth and Zemmel, 2004). Such a new strategy
is also called drug repositioning or drug repurposing. A strong
support for the possibility of drug repositioning is the increas-
ingly accepted concept of ‘polypharmacology’, i.e. individual
drugs can interact with multiple targets rather than a single
target (MacDonald et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2012). For example,
serotonin and serotonergic drugs can interact with both 5-HT G
protein-coupled receptors and 59HT3A ion channel proteins,
even though these two target proteins are not related in sequence
or structure (Cheng et al., 2012; Keiser et al., 2007; Kroeze et al.,
2002; Roth et al., 2004). This polypharmacological property of a
drug enables us to identify more than one target that it can act on
and hence develop its new uses.

In silica prediction of interactions between drugs and target
proteins provides an important tool for drug repositioning, as it
can significantly reduce wet-laboratory work and lower the cost
of the experimental determination of new drug-target inter-
actions (DTIs). Various methods have been proposed for in
silico DTI prediction. When 3D structures are available, molecu-
lar docking is commonly used to virtually screen a large number
of compounds against a target protein (Cheng et al., 2007;
Donald, 2011; Morris et al., 2009). When 3D structures of mol-
ecules are absent, a number of different approaches have been
developed to address the in silico DTI prediction problem. Most
of these structure-free methods can be grouped into two classes,
namely, ligand-based and network-based approaches. A represen-
tative ligand-based approach is the similarity ensemble approach
(Keiser et al., 2007, 2009), which predicts new DTIs using 2D
structure similarity of ligands. Although ligand-based
approaches are able to discover a number of DTIs that have
been validated experimentally, they have difﬁculty in identifying
drugs with novel scaffolds that differ from those of reference
compounds (Yabuuchi et al., 2011).

Numerous network-based approaches have been proposed to
exploit latent features of DTI profiles and have recently become
a popular tool for DTI prediction and drug repositioning
(Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009; Chen et al., 2012; Cheng et al.,
2012; Mei et al., 2012; van Laarhoven et al., 2011; Xia et al.,
2010; Xie et al., 2012; Yamanishi et al., 2008). Although these
network-based approaches have achieved promising results,
most of them can only predict binary DTIs, that is, they can
only determine whether a drug interacts with a target protein,
but cannot tell how they interact with each other. However, in-
dividual DTIs generally have different meanings. For example,
drug-target pairs can be described by different relationships, such
as direct and indirect interactions (Gunther et al., 2008). A direct
interaction is usually caused by protein-ligand binding, whereas
an indirect interaction can be induced by the changed expression

Predicting DTIs using RBMs

 

level of a protein or active metabolites produced by a drug. In
addition, DTIs can be annotated with different drug modes of
action, e.g. activation and inhibition (Kuhn et al., 2012). Here,
‘drug modes of action’ may be slightly different from the term
used in the literature, e.g. (Iorio et al., 2010). In this article, we
mainly use this term to represent the following three speciﬁc
types of interactions: binding, activation and inhibition.
Hereinafter, we will use ‘types of DTIs’ to represent both drug-
target relationships and drug modes of action. A network in
which links are associated with different meanings is called the
multidimensional network (Lu and Zhou, 2011). In our context,
we call a DTI network where links are annotated with different
types of interactions the multidimensional DT I network. On the
one hand, types of DTIs provide additional useful information,
which can be incorporated into a multidimensional network to
improve DTI prediction. On the other hand, the predicted types
of DTIs can extend our understanding about the molecular basis
of drug action. Despite these positive aspects, current rich infor-
mation about types of DT Is (Gunther et al., 2008; Kuhn et al.,
2012) has not been well exploited for DT I prediction, and how to
incorporate such information into a multidimensional network to
predict diﬂerent types of DT Is still remains an open question.

In this article, we propose an effective machine-learning ap-
proach to accurately predict different types of DTIs on a multi-
dimensional network. Unlike previous network-based
approaches (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009; Chen et al., 2012;
Cheng et al., 2012; Mei et al., 2012; van Laarhoven et al., 2011;
Xia et al., 2010; Yamanishi et al., 2008), which only predict
binary DTIs, our approach not only identiﬁes new DTIs but
also infers their corresponding types of interactions, such as
drug-target relationships or drug modes of action. Our approach
uses a generalized version of a two-layer undirected graphical
model, called restricted Boltzmann machine (RBM) (Hinton
and Salakhutdinov, 2006), to represent a multidimensional
DTI network, which encodes different types of DTIs. In add-
ition, we apply a practical learning algorithm, called Contrastive
Divergence (CD) (Hinton, 2002), to train our RBM model and
predict unknown types of DTIs.

To our knowledge, our work is the first approach to predict
diﬂerent types of DT Is on a multidimensional network, which
not only describes binary DT Is but also encodes their correspond-
ing types of interactions. We have tested our algorithm on two
public databases, namely, MATADOR (Gunther et al., 2008)
and STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2012), which contain information
about drug-target relationships and drug modes of action, re-
spectively. Our tests demonstrate that our RBM model can be
used as a highly powerful tool for integrating different types of
DTIs into a multidimensional network and predicting different
types of interactions with high accuracy. In particular, our results
show that integrating different types of DTIs into prediction with
distinction can achieve the area under precision-recall curve
(AUPR) up to 89.6, which can signiﬁcantly outperform other
predictions either by simply mixing multiple types of interactions
without distinction or using only a single interaction type.
Further tests show that our approach can predict a high percent-
age of novel DTIs that has been validated by known experiments
in the literature or other databases. These results indicate that
our approach can have potential applications in drug reposition-
ing and hence advance the drug discovery process.

1.1 Related work

A number of network-based approaches have been proposed for
predicting unknown interactions between drugs and targets. In
Yamanishi et al. (2008), a supervised learning framework was
developed based on a bipartite graph, which integrates both
chemical and genomic spaces by mapping them into a uniﬁed
space. Cheng et al. (2012) proposed a network-based inference
approach to predict new DTIs by exploiting the topology simi-
larity of the underlying interaction network. In Zhao and Li
(2010), drug phenotypic, chemical indexes and protein—protein
interactions in genomic space were integrated into a computa-
tional framework for DTI prediction. Chen et al. (2012) pro-
posed a random walk approach for DTI prediction based on a
heterogeneous network, which integrates drug similarity, target
similarity and DTI similarity. Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009)
presented a new approach, called Bipartite Local Model
(BLM), to predict unknown DTIs by combining independent
drug-based and target-based prediction results using a supervised
learning method. Mei et al. (2012) further extended this BLM
approach to incorporate the capacity of learning from neighbors
and predict the interactions for new drug or target candidates. In
Xia et al. (2010), a manifold regularization semi-supervised learn-
ing method was proposed to integrate heterogenous biological
data sources for DTI prediction. A regularized least square al-
gorithm was proposed in van Laarhoven et al. (2011) for DTI
prediction using a product of kernels derived from DTI proﬁles.
In Gottlieb et al. (2011), He et al. (2010) and Perhnan et al.
(2011), DTI prediction was formulated into a classiﬁcation prob-
lem after deﬁning multiple groups of drug-related and target-
related features, such as drug—drug and gene—gene similarity
measures. In addition to chemical and genomic data, phenotypic
information, such as side-effect proﬁles (Campillos et al., 2008;
Mizutani et al., 2012), transcriptional response data (Iorio et al.,
2010) and public gene expression data (Dudley et al., 2011; Sirota
et al., 2011), has also been used for DTI prediction and drug
repositioning. Although previous network-based approaches
have achieved promising results for DTI prediction and drug
repositioning, few of them are speciﬁcally designed for integrat-
ing and predicting different types of DTIs on a multidimensional
network.

RBMs, which are used as important learning modules for con-
structing deep belief nets (Arel et al., 2010; Bengio, 2009), have
been successfully applied in many ﬁelds, such as dimensionality
reduction (Hinton and Salakhutdinov, 2006), classiﬁcation (Lar-
ochelle and Bengio, 2008), collaborative ﬁltering (Salakhutdinov
et al., 2007) and computational biology (Eickholt and Cheng,
2012). Recently, the predictive power of RBMs has also been
demonstrated in the Netﬁix Prize contest (Bell and Koren,
2007; Salakhutdinov et al., 2007), a public competition for de-
veloping the best collaborative ﬁltering algorithm to predict user
ratings for movies. To our knowledge, our work is the ﬁrst ap-
proach to apply RBMs into large-scale DTI prediction.

Fig. 1. An RBM with binary hidden units representing latent features
and visible units encoding observed types of DTIs. (A) Overview of an
RBM, where m is the number of hidden units and n is the number of
visible units. (B) The information encoded in a visible unit

used to learn a probability distribution over input data (Hinton and
Salakhutdinov, 2006). As shown in Figure 1A, an RBM consists of a
layer of visible units and a layer of hidden units. Each visible unit is
connected to all hidden units, and no intra-layer connection exists be-
tween any pair of visible units or any pair of hidden units. In our RBM
model, visible units encode observed types of DTIs, such as drug-target
relationships and drug modes of action (Fig. 1B), and hidden units rep-
resent latent features describing DTIs.

We use a simple example (Fig. 2) to describe how to construct RBMs
from a multidimensional DTI network. Figure 2A shows a toy example
of a multidimensional DTI network, where each DTI is associated with
binary variables, which represent the states of direct and indirect inter-
actions, respectively. As shown in Figure 2B, we build a speciﬁc RBM for
every single target with the same number of hidden units and the same
deﬁnitions of visible units. The binary states of visible variables for those
missing DTIs are treated as zero in the constructed RBMs. The con-
structed RBMs for a multidimensional DTI network are associated
with the same parameters. In other words, the constructed RBMs for
all targets use the same parameters between hidden and visible layers.
In Figure 2B, both RBMs for both target 1 and target 2 share the same
parameters.

Compared with other prediction approaches, our RBM model can
capture not only the correlations of drug-target pairs in a DTI network
but also the correlations of different types of DTIs. Here, we use the
simple example shown in Figure 2 to illustrate how our RBM model
exploits the corrections in a multidimensional network to make predic-
tion. Suppose that we have known different types of DTIs for target 1 in
this example. To know which states of hidden units our RBM model
should have, we let the three drugs send messages to hidden units and
update their corresponding states. Conversely, once we know the states of
hidden units for target 1, hidden units then send messages to visible units
for the connected drugs and update their corresponding states. As in
other collaborative ﬁltering applications (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007),
after a number of iterations of the aforementioned updates, our RBM
model can effectively capture the underlying features encoded in a multi-
dimensional network. Based on the trained parameters between layers of
hidden and visible units, our RBM model can then predict unknown
types of DTIs based on input visible data.

In an RBM, suppose that in total there are n visible units, m hidden
units and t types of DTI encoded in a visible unit. Let binary indicator
vector vi 2 (v1, ..., vf‘, ..., v?), i: l, ...,n, denote state of the i—th vis-
ible unit, where visible variables vf.‘ = 1 if the k-th type of DTI is observed
in input data, and vf.‘ = 0 otherwise. Let binary indicator variable h],
j = l, ...,m, denote the state of the j-th hidden unit. Let  be the
weight associated with a connection between visible variable vf.‘ and
hidden variable hj. Let v 2 (v1, ...,vn) and h = (h, ...,hm) denote the
conﬁgurations of visible and hidden layers, respectively. Then (v, h) is
called a joint conﬁguration of an RBM. As there is no intra-layer connec-
tion within both hidden and visible layers in an RBM, the energy of a

where n, m and t are the numbers of visible units, hidden units and types
of DTI encoded in a visible unit, respectively, vf‘, hj are visible variables
and hidden units, respectively, and a1“, bj are their corresponding bias
weights (offsets), and  is the corresponding weight for the connection
between visible variable vf.‘ and hidden variable h]. Then, the probability
of a joint conﬁguration (v, h) can be deﬁned by

Pr(v, h) = %exp(—E(v, h)) (2)

where Z = Z“, (—E(V, h)) is called the normalizing constant or partition
function. Summing over all possible conﬁgurations of h, we obtain the
following marginal distribution over visible data v:

Pr(v) =  exp(—E(V, h)). (3)

As there is no intra-layer connection between any pair of visible or
hidden units, we can deﬁne the following conditional probabilities:

Pr(vf = 1 I h) = (ref + f ijhj) (4)

where n, m and t are the numbers of visible units, hidden units and types
of DTI encoded in a visible unit, respectively, and a(x) = l/(l + e"“) is
the logistic function. These conditional probabilities are important for the
iterative updates between hidden and visible layers when training an
RBM model.

Unlike the conditional probabilities of visible variables in
Salakhutdinov et al. (2007), which used a conditional multinomial distri-
bution, here, our conditional probability of visible variables in Equation
(4) uses a conditional Bernoulli distribution. This is because in our RBM
model, more than one visible variable can be assigned one for a DTI. For
example, a DTI can be annotated with ‘direct’, ‘binding’ and ‘inhibition’
simultaneously. Our RBM model is data-driven and respect data as much
as possible. As also demonstrated in Salakhutdinov et al. (2007), RBMs
can capture the nature distribution of data. As we treat each interaction
type as a separate binary variable, it is possible that two inconsistent
interaction types (e.g. ‘direct’ and ‘indirect’) can be both yielded by our
RBM model. This means that the data implies that these two interaction

types are both possible. In addition, by deﬁning each interaction type as a
separate variable, our RBM model is general and can be easily extended
to include more interaction types from other data sources without much
manual inspection on the consistence of different types of DTIs.

2.2 Training

We ﬁrst use a real example to demonstrate the complexity of parameter
training in our RBM model. In the MATADOR-based data that we have
tested (Section 3.1), the number of drugs is n = 784. When only predict-
ing direct and indirect interactions, the number of interaction types that
we need to consider is t=2. In our RBM model, we typically set the
number of hidden units m = 100. In such a case, the total number of
parameters in our RBM model is n >1< t + m + n >1< m >1< t = 158468. In gen-
eral, training an RBM with such a large number of parameters posts a
difﬁcult task. Later in the text, we will describe how to perform parameter
training in an RBM model.

To train an RBM and learn its parameter, we need to maximize the
likelihood of visible data with respect to the parameters W, a? and b].
To achieve this goal, we could perform gradient ascent in the log-likeli-
hood of the training data derived from Equation (3) and incrementally
adjust the weights and biases:

810gPr(v)
AWE: —=
’1 6 8Vij.

k k

where 8 is the learning rate, < - > dam denotes an expectation of the data
distribution and < - >m0del denotes an expectation of the distribution
deﬁned by the model.

In Equation (6), < - >dam can be computed easily based on the fre-
quency information obtained from visible data. Unfortunately, it is gen-
erally difﬁcult to compute < - > mode], as it would require exponential time
to do so. To avoid this problem, Hinton (2002) proposed a practical
learning algorithm, called Contrastive Divergence (CD), which minimizes
the Kullback—Leibler divergence. In this work, we use a mean-ﬁeld ver-
sion of the CD algorithm (Le Roux and Bengio, 2008; Welling and
Hinton, 2002) to train our RBM model. In particular, we use the follow-
ing procedure in each training pass to incrementally adjust the weights
and biases:

AW§=€(<V§/‘1j>data_ <v§hj>T) 

Aaf=e(<vf.‘>dam— <va>T) (8)

Abj=e(<hj>dam— <hj>T) (9)

where 8 is the learning rate, < - >dam denotes an average value over all
input data for each update and < - > T denotes the average value over T
mean-ﬁeld iterations, which is considered a good approximation of
< - >m0del in the log-likelihood function in Equation (6) (Hinton, 2002;
Le Roux and Bengio, 2008; Welling and Hinton, 2002).

2.3 Making predictions

To predict the unknown types of DTIs for a given target with visible data
v, we compute the following probability distribution after one iteration of
the mean-ﬁeld updates (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007):

n l
ﬁj : Pr(hj I V) = 0(1)} + Z Z  
i=1 k=1
Pr(vf=1|131, ---,ﬁm)=a(af+ZWf§3-), (11)
1:1

where n, m and t are the numbers of visible units, hidden units and types

of DTI encoded in a visible unit, respectively, W’s, af.‘ and bj are

parameters that have been learned in Section 2.2, and pj is the conditional
probability of hidden variable hj- given visible data. After that, we com-
pute the expectation as our ﬁnal prediction for the query target.

2.4 Conditional RBMs

For a drug-target pair, which does not have a connection on a multidi-
mensional DTI network, it could be considered either a missing inter-
action or a negative interaction. In general, a set of known DTIs that
have been veriﬁed experimentally provide more reliable information than
those drug-target pairs, which do not have connections on a multidimen-
sional DTI network. To incorporate this additional information, we use a
conditional RBM (Salakhutdinov et al., 2007) to further formulate our
prediction problem. Let r = (r1, . . . , rm) be a binary indicator vector, in
which rj = 1 if there exists a known DTI between the input target and the
j-th drug, and rj = 0 otherwise. The states of rJ- can be directly obtained
based on the visible DTI data from a constructed DTI network. Here, r is
a binary indicator vector representing the reliability of observed data. In
general, DTIs that have been veriﬁed experimentally provide more reli-
able information than unknown DTIs. A conditional RBM deﬁnes a
joint distribution over (v, h) conditioned on r. In a conditional RBM,
the conditional probabilities of visible and hidden units can be written as:

n l m
Pr(hj =1|v,r)=a<bj+ZZWf§va+ZDUr,), (12)
i=1 k=1 i=1
where Di]- is a parameter describing the effect of r on h. The parameter DU-
can be also learned using the CD algorithm:

ADij=6(<//lj>dam— <hj>T)l'i. 

2.5 Implementation

We chose a conditional RBM to perform DTI prediction on a multidi-
mensional network that encodes different types of DTIs. The algorithm
was implemented in Java, using the jaRBM package (http://sourceforge.
net/projects/jarbm/). For the value of m, we chose an empirical range
according to the literature. Here, we chose m = 100. We set learning
rate 6 = 0.01. For other parameters, we chose the default values that
were deﬁned in the jaRBM package. The initial values of W’s, bj, a?
and Di]- were sampled from Gaussian distribution with standard deriv-
ation 0.1. In the CD learning procedure, we ran the mean-ﬁeld updates
100 passes over training data. The training of our RBM model runs in
several hours on a typical training dataset. For example, the training of
our RBM model on the MATADOR-based data (Supplementary Table
S1 in Section S1) takes 5.5 h on a PC machine with a 3.3 GHz Intel core i5
processor and 4 GB memory.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Datasets and evaluation metrics

We tested our RBM model on two datasets, which were derived
from MATADOR (Gunther et al., 2008) and STITCH (Kuhn
et al., 2012), respectively. MATADOR is a manually curated
online database, which mainly describes drug-target relation-
ships, including direct and indirect DTIs. The list of direct and
indirect DTIs in MATADOR was ﬁrst extracted by automated
text-mining and then followed by manual annotation (Gunther
et al., 2008). STITCH provides modes of action for the inter-
actions between proteins and chemicals, which were annotated
based on evidence derived from known experiments in the litera-
ture (Kuhn et al., 2012). For the MATADOR-based dataset,
we only extracted those DTI records in which protein and

drug names are present and annotation terms correspond to
‘DIRECT’ or ‘INDIRECT’. For the STITCH-based dataset,
we only kept a list of DTI records in which drugs and target
proteins overlap those in MATADOR. For the mode of action
term in the STITCH-based data, we only considered ‘binding’,
‘activation’ and ‘inhibition’. In summary, the MATADOR-
based dataset contains 784 drugs, 2431 protein targets and
13 064 DTIs, in which 7862 interactions are direct and 5202 inter-
actions are indirect. The STITCH-based dataset contains 598
drugs, 671 protein targets and 3296 DTIs, in which 2589, 945
and 1493 interactions are annotated with ‘binding’, ‘activation’
and ‘inhibition’, respectively. Descriptive statistics about these
two datasets can be found in Table S1 in Supplementary
Material Section S1.

Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) and Precision-Recall
(PR) curves are commonly used to assess the performance of a
prediction model. For highly skewed data, ROC curves can give
an overoptimistic picture of an algorithm’s performance (Davis
and Goadrich, 2006). In this scenario, PR curves provide a better
view of the prediction results than ROC curves. As stated in
Bleakley and Yamanishi (2009) and van Laarhoven et al.
(2011), when evaluating the DTI prediction results, in which
there are usually few positive DTIs, PR curves provide greater
biological signiﬁcance and are considered a better quality meas-
ure than ROC curves. Therefore, we mainly used PR curves and
the AUPR curve to evaluate the performance of our algorithm,
though we also reported the area under the ROC curve (AUC) in
our test results.

3.2 Predicting direct and indirect DTIs

In general, drug-target relationships can be classiﬁed into two
categories, including direct and indirect interactions. Direct inter-
actions are usually caused by protein-ligand binding, whereas
indirect interactions can be driven by different mechanisms.
For instance, indirect interactions can be induced by metabolites
of drugs or changes in gene expressions (Gunther et al., 2008). To
examine whether our algorithm can accurately predict direct and
indirect DTIs on a multidimensional network, we tested it on the
MATADOR-based data. In particular, we performed the follow-
ing three tests: (i) Integrating both direct and indirect DTIs with
distinction, which means that the input data of the RBM is a
multidimensional vector indicating different types of inter-
actions; (ii) Mixing both direct and indirect DTIs without dis-
tinction, which means that the input data is a one-dimensional
binary vector indicating whether DTIs are observed; (iii) Using
only a single interaction type (i.e. using only direct or indirect
DTIs). For each test, we performed a 10-fold cross-validation
procedure, as described in Supplementary Material Section S3.
The results of the aforementioned three tests are summarized
in Table 1, and their corresponding PR curves are shown in
Figure 3. When integrating both direct and indirect interactions
with distinction, our algorithm achieved the best performance
with an AUPR score up to 89.6 for direct interaction prediction
and 80.1 for indirect interaction prediction. These results demon-
strated that our RBM model can effectively integrate different
drug-target relationships on a multidimensional DTI network to
accurately predict direct or indirect interactions. In addition, our
results showed that integrating both direct and indirect DTIs

with distinction signiﬁcantly outperformed the other two tests,
which only considered a single interaction type or simply mixed
direct and indirect interactions without distinction. In particular,
the integration of direct and indirect interactions improved the
AUPR score by >10% for direct interaction prediction and
>17% for indirect interaction prediction (Table 1). In PR
curves, compared with the other two tests, integrating both inter-
action types with distinction achieved a better precision value
almost at every recall value (Fig. 3). An interesting result is that
mixing both interactions without distinction yielded worse per-
formance than using a single interaction type (Table 1). For ex-
ample, for direct interaction prediction, the AUPR score was
decreased from 78.9 to 72.1. This result implies that incorporating
a new data type into DTI prediction is non-trivial and requires

Predicting DTIs using RBMs

 

careful data integration. In addition, our results show that our
RBM model respect the data and can predict a high percentage
of consistent DTIs. For example, when we chose 0.5 as the prob-
ability threshold to infer the interaction type, >99% of positive
DTIs predicted by our algorithm were consistent (i.e. <1 % of DTIs
were predicted as both direct and indirect interactions).

In our 10-fold cross-validation test (Table 1), the test method
‘using direct (indirect) interaction only’ used less training data
than other two test methods. This may create bias when compar-
ing two prediction methods using training data with different
sizes. To make a fair comparison, we have made an additional
comparison between methods ‘integrating data with distinction’
and ‘using direct (indirect) interaction only’ using training data
of the same size (Supplementary Material Section S4). Our new
comparison results conﬁrmed that integrating data with distinc-
tion outperformed the method that uses a single interaction only.

To check whether our algorithm can have a wider range of
applications, we also performed a 5-fold cross-validation test
(Supplementary Material Section S3). Compared with the 10-
fold cross-validation results, we only found a small decrease in
our algorithm’s performance in the 5-fold cross-validation test.

To perform more sanity check on our algorithm’s perform-
ance, we also conducted another test that is similar to leave-one-
out cross-validation except that we removed homologous pro-
teins from training data. For training data, we only kept those
DTIs in which proteins have sequence identity < 25 % to the target
of the validating interaction. This process can signiﬁcantly reduce
the size of dataset. In our test, the training dataset has only ~300
targets. This test is more rigorous than previous leave-one-out
cross-validation (LOOCV) tests performed in (Bleakley and
Yamanishi, 2009; van Laarhoven et al., 2011; Yamanishi et al.,
2008), in that we have removed similar proteins with high sequence
identity from training data and thus reduced impact of protein
homology on the network-based prediction of DTIs.

The results of our LOOCV like test show that, our approach
still achieved decent prediction accuracy, with AUPR 79.0 for
direct interaction prediction, but the AUPR score for indirect
interaction prediction dropped to 59.1. We further investigated
this problem and found that the average degree of indirect inter-
actions with drugs for targets in training data was reduced to
1.67. With insufﬁcient number of DTIs, it would be difﬁcult to
train our RBM model and make accurate prediction.

To mimic the real situation in which DTI network data are
available, we also performed an additional test on those DTIs in
which the degree of the target is above the average degree of the
multidimensional network (i.e. the degree of the target in the
validating interaction is Z 6). The results of this test show that,
our approach achieved decent performance, with AUPR 80.4 for
direct interaction prediction and 74.5 for indirect interaction pre-
diction. These results indicate that in the real situation, our RBM
model can make reasonably accurate prediction even homolo-
gous proteins are not present in training data.

As little work has been developed for predicting unknown
types of DTIs in a multidimensional network, it is difﬁcult for
us to directly compare our work with other prediction
approaches. Instead, we have compared our algorithm with a
simple logic-based approach on the MATADOR-based data.
This simple logic-based approach follows the basic premise (i.e.
similar drugs and targets should have similar interactions) that

has been widely used in previous prediction approaches. More
details of this simple logic-based algorithm can be found
in Supplementary Material Section S5. As summarized in
Table 2, the comparison results show that our algorithm outper-
formed the simple logic based approach. This is expected, as the
simple logic based approach simply uses the closest interaction
type proﬁles to predict unknown types of DTIs. Such a strategy
only exploits a small proportion of training data and cannot be
sufﬁcient enough to capture the deep correlations of different
types of DTIs in a multidimensional network. On the other
hand, our RBM model uses hidden units to represent the intrin-
sic correlations of different types of DTIs in the network and can
effectively capture the latent feature of drug-target relationships
and thus make accurate predictions.

Overall, our approach achieved better performance for direct
interaction prediction than for indirect interaction prediction
(Table 1). Probably this is because in the MATADOR-based
data, indirect interactions describe many different mechanisms
of DTIs and thus provide less predictive power than direct inter-
actions. We expect that our method would achieve better per-
formance for indirect interaction prediction if different
mechanisms of indirect DTIs in the MATADOR-based data
could be further identiﬁed.

3.3 Predicting drug modes of action

In addition to direct and indirect interactions, DTIs can be also
annotated with different drug modes of action, such as activation
or inhibition. To evaluate our algorithm’s performance on pre-
dicting different drug modes of action, we tested it mainly on the
STITCH-based data. We focused on three drug modes of action,
including binding, activation and inhibition. In addition to test-
ing the STITCH-based data, we included two additional tests,
which further incorporated the MATADOR-based data, that is,
each DTI in the STITCH-based data was also associated with
direct or indirect interaction derived from the MATADOR-
based data. Overall, we conducted the following ﬁve tests: (i)
integrating both drug-target relationships from the
MATADOR-based data and drug modes of action from the
STITCH-based data with distinction; (ii) mixing DTIs from
both MATADOR-based and STITCH-based data without dis-
tinction (i.e. all DTIs were associated with only binary values);
(iii) integrating drug modes of action from the STITCH-based
data with distinction; (iv) mixing drug modes of action from the
STITCH-based data without distinction; and (v) using a singe
mode of action from the STITCH-based data. For every test, we

also carried out a 10-fold cross-validation procedure as described
in Supplementary Material Section S3.

Both AUC and AUPR scores of the aforementioned ﬁve tests
are reported in Table 3, and their corresponding PR curves are
shown in Figure 4. When integrating different types of DTIs with
distinction, our algorithm can achieve AUC up to 96.9 and
AUPR up to 79.1. The test results showed that our RBM
model can effectively exploit different types of interactions
encoded in a multidimensional DTI network to predict drug
modes of action. Among all ﬁve tests, integrating different
types of DTIs with distinction produced higher AUPR scores
than the other tests, which used only a single interaction type
or simply mixed types of interactions without distinction. When
differentiating different types of DTIs, integrating direct and in-
direct interactions from the MATADOR-based data slightly im-
proved the prediction performance. When comparing the results
on predicting different modes of action, binding interactions
were predicted with higher accuracy than activation and inhib-
ition interactions. This is probably because in the STITCH-based
data, binding interactions are more informative in predicting
DTIs than other two modes of action.

As in Section 3.2, we also performed an additional test using
training data of the same size for comparing methods ‘integrating
data with distinction’ and ‘using a single data type only’, when
predicting different modes of action. Our new comparison results
conﬁrmed that integrating different data types with distinction
outperformed the method that uses only a single data type
(Supplementary Material Section S4).

3.4 New predictions

To examine our algorithm’s ability for predicting novel DTIs
that are not present in our data derived from MATADOR, we

Table 3. Results on predicting drug modes of action

performed the following test, which is similar to the experiments
conducted in (Bleakley and Yamanishi, 2009; van Laarhoven
et al., 2011). We predicted unknown direct DTIs using the com-
plete MATADOR-based dataset as training data. For the pre-
dicted results, we mainly focused on DTIs involving these
proteins that are not listed as drug-metabolizing enzymes or
transporter proteins in DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011). We cut-
putted the set of the top 50 scoring predictions that are not pre-
sent in training data. We then checked whether these new
predicted DTIs appear in other databases, including ChEMBL
(Gaulton et al., 2011), DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011) and
STITCH (Kuhn et al., 2012).

Supplementary Figure S1 in Section S2 visualizes part of the
DTI network constructed based on the set of the 50 highest
scoring interactions predicted by our approach using the
MATADOR-based data. Table 4 shows the list of the top 10
scoring direct DTI predictions. Among these predicted DTIs, a
high fraction of the predicted interactions (7 of 10) was found in
ChEMBL, DrugBank or STITCH. In the remaining three DTIs
that we did not ﬁnd experimental evidence from the three data-
bases, there might still exist interaction for each drug-target pair.
For example, although it is known that mifepristone does not
bind to estrogen receptor, it may have some effects on the ex-
pression of estrogen receptor (Jiang et al., 2007).

In Table 4, some of our new predictions are trivial, as they can
also be easily derived based on known interactions of similar
proteins or drugs in the dataset. However, our new predictions
also provided some interesting results. For example, among the
top 50 scoring predictions, our algorithm suggested that there
may exist interactions between spironolactone and the mem-
brane progestin receptor gamma protein and between mesalazine
(also called 5-aminosalicylic acid) and leukotriene—A4 hydrolase

N ate: ‘Integrating MATADOR and STITCH with distinction’ corresponds to the test in which our algorithm integrated both drug-target relationships from the MATADOR-
based data and drug modes of action from the STITCH-based data with distinction. ‘Mixing MATADOR and STITCH without distinction’ corresponds to the test in which
our algorithm mixed DTIs from both MATADOR-based and STITCH-based data without distinction. ‘Integrating data with distinction’ corresponds to the test in which our
algorithm integrated drug modes of action from the STITCH-based data with distinction. ‘Mixing data without distinction’ corresponds to the test in which our algorithm
mixed drug modes of action from the STITCH-based data without distinction. ‘Using binding (activation or inhibition) interactions only’ corresponds to the test in which our

algorithm used only binding (activation or inhibition) interactions from the STITCH-based data. The highest AUPR score is shown in bold.

(LTA4H) enzyme. Spironolactone is known as a diuretic or anti-
hypertensive drug and can act on the aldosterone receptor as a
competitive antagonist (Macdonald, 1997). Our predicted inter-
action between spironolactone and membrane progestin receptor
gamma protein indicates that spironolactone may have some
progestogenic function. Interestingly, this hypothesis can be con-
ﬁrmed from the clinical studies performed in (Nakhjavani et al.,
2009). In addition, mesalazine is an anti-inﬂammatory drug that
is primarily used to treat inﬂammatory bowel disease (Sandborn
et al., 2007). LTA4H is an important enzyme that converts leu-
kotriene-A4 to leukotriene-B4 (Rudberg et al., 2004). It has been
proposed that leukotriene-B4 may play an important role in a
number of different acute and chronic inﬂammatory diseases,
including inﬂammatory bowel disease (Haeggstrdm, 2000).
These studies imply that our predicted interaction between mesa-
lazine and LTA4H is probably true.

These results on new predictions indicated that our RBM
model is practically useful in predicting novel DTIs and can
have potential applications in drug repositioning.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we proposed a ﬁrst machine-learning approach to
predict different types of DTIs on a multidimensional network.
Our approach uses an RBM model to effectively encode multiple
sources of information about DTIs and accurately predict

different types of DTIs, such as drug-target relationships or
drug modes of action. Tests on two public databases showed
that our algorithm can achieve excellent prediction performance
with high AUPR scores. Further tests indicated that our ap-
proach can infer a list of novel DTIs, which is practically
useful for drug repositioning.

Although our algorithm has been tested only on direct and
indirect drug-target relationships, and three drug modes of
action, it is general and can be easily extended to integrate
other types of DTIs (e.g. phenotypic effects). Current version
of our prediction algorithm only considers connections between
drugs and targets. In the future, we will extend our approach to
exploit the connections within target proteins or drugs. For ex-
ample, the sequence similarity scores between target proteins, the
substructure similarity scores between drugs or drug—drug inter-
actions (Gottlieb et al., 2012; Tatonetti et al., 2012) can be also
incorporated into our prediction model. As the conventional
version of an RBM does not allow the connections within the
same layer, such an extension will require careful thought.
Currently, our algorithm has been tested only on two databases
(i.e. MATADOR and STITCH). We will test it on more data in
the future. For example, it will have more signiﬁcance if we can
predict DTIs based on human proteins and all molecules in
PubChem (Kaiser, 2005) or a similar database. Finally, we are
also seeking wet-laboratory collaborators to experimentally
verify the highest scoring DTIs predicted by our algorithm.

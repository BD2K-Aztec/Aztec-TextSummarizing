ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions have
been established as a powerful tool for the prediction of cellular
phenotypes and metabolic capabilities of organisms. In recent years,
the number of network reconstructions has been constantly increas-
ing, mostly because of the availability of novel (semi-)automated pro-
cedures, which enabled the reconstruction of metabolic models based
on individual genomes and their annotation. The resulting models are
widely used in numerous applications. However, the accuracy and
predictive power of network reconstructions are commonly limited
by inherent inconsistencies and gaps.

Results: Here we present a novel method to validate metabolic
network reconstructions based on the concept of autocatalytic sets.
Autocatalytic sets correspond to collections of metabolites that,
besides enzymes and a growth medium, are required to produce all
biomass components in a metabolic model. These autocatalytic sets
are well-conserved across all domains of life, and their identification in
speciﬁc genome-scale reconstructions allows us to draw conclusions
about potential inconsistencies in these models. The method is
capable of detecting inconsistencies, which are neglected by other
gap-finding methods. We tested our method on the Model SEED,
which is the largest repository for automatically generated genome-
scale network reconstructions. In this way, we were able to identify a
significant number of missing pathways in several of these reconstruc-
tions. Hence, the method we report represents a powerful tool to
identify inconsistencies in large-scale metabolic networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, genome-scale metabolic network reconstructions
have become an important tool in systems biology (Thiele and
Palsson, 2010). They have the strong potential to combine dis-
tinct experimental data with bibliomic resources to generate a
comprehensive knowledge base (Feist and Palsson, 2008;
Wesser et al., 2011). The resulting network reconstructions
have been widely used to simulate metabolic processes or to
explore the metabolic capabilities of various species (Kaleta
et al., 2011; Ruppin et al., 2010). A prominent approach applying
network reconstructions is constraint-based modeling, such as
ﬂux balance analysis (FBA) (Lewis et al., 2012; Ruppin et al.,
2010). The use of metabolic models and associated methods has
granted access to diverse scientiﬁc subjects, such as analysis of
the bacterial metabolism OK us et al., 2009), the prediction
of growth rates of Escherichia coli Warma and Palsson, 1994),
the comparison of growth rates between wild type and mutant
strains of E.coli (Segre et al., 2002) and metabolic engineering
Wang et al., 2006).

Until recently, the process of network reconstruction was time-
consuming and necessarily required laborious curation effort
(Durot et al., 2009). To cope with the increasing amount of
available data, automated methods became necessary to produce
high-throughput reconstructions as well. Several approaches are
available to address this issue (Barua and Reed, 2010; Jerby
et al., 2010; Li et al., 2010). The Model SEED project success-
fully implemented one of these approaches and contains
>190 metabolic reconstructions, which were primarily generated
in an automated way (Henry et al., 2010).

However, the automated process may neglect metabolic
capabilities of the focal organism or include wrongly identiﬁed
functionalities (Orth and Palsson, 2010). To minimize this bias,
manual reﬁnement and optimization are instrumental in the
reconstruction process (Henry et al., 2010; Thiele and Palsson,
2010), representing the most intricate elements in the workﬂow.
To accelerate model curation, automated and semi-automated
methods for the detection and correction of gaps were developed
and integrated in the automated reconstruction process by
the Model SEED (GapFind and GapFill) (Henry et al., 2010;
Satish Kumar et al., 2007). The most common approach used
to identify gaps in network reconstructions is constraint-based

modeling that relies on optimization-based algorithms. The pre-
dominant aim is to detect metabolites that cannot be produced at
a steady state (Latendresse et al., 2012; Ponce-dc Leon et al.,
2013; Satish Kumar et al., 2007).

Here we report ASBIG (Autocatalytic Set-Based Identiﬁcation
of Gaps), a method that detects incomplete parts of network
reconstructions based on a novel approach: identifying elements
(compounds) of catalytic cycles. ASBIG screens models for
essential, self-replicating metabolites, which are pivotal elements
of the underlying metabolism. A metabolite is considered to be
pivotal if it is required for metabolism to proceed. The com-
pounds are called ‘self-replicating’, or ‘autocatalytic’, as they
are usually required for their own biosynthesis (Kun et al.,
2008). Hence, their production is inaccessible unless an initial
amount of the compound is already available. Self-replicating
metabolites are energy-currency cofactors, such as ATP and
NAD. If these compounds are not present within the cell, even
a rich nutritional medium is often insufﬁcient for an organism to
produce all of its biomass components. The deﬁnition of self-
replicating metabolites originates from the work of Eigen and
Schuster (1977), in which the concepts of catalytic cycles and
autocatalysis were described on a molecular level. The search
for autocatalytic compounds is conducted via the method of
scope analysis (Handorf et al., 2005).

The set of self-replicators in each network reconstruction
is generally small (Kun et al., 2008). Furthermore, autocatalytic
sets of different organisms very likely contain similar
well-conserved compounds. These observations can be used to
survey any given metabolic network to detect inherent inconsis-
tencies. If the number of self-replicating compounds is compar-
ably large or unexpected elements and large macromolecules are
included in the set, conclusions about possible inconsistencies
can be drawn. Hence, gaps in the reconstructed network can
lead to the presence of unexpected compounds in the set of
self-replicators (owing to the impaired biosynthesis of this com-
pound or its successors).

ASBIG enriches the tool box of gap-ﬁnding procedures, as
common ﬂux calculating methods are susceptible to overlook
gaps associated with autocatalytic cycles. One simple example
is a cofactor that is required for the production of a biomass
component but itself is not present in the biomass reaction. In
such a case, it would be sufﬁcient for constraint-based methods,
such as FBA, if reactions that replenish the cofactor exist to
produce biomass. A biosynthetic route of this essential cofactor
would not be required making the detection of a lack of this
route impossible for F BA. ASBIG uses scope analysis to deter-
mine such inconsistencies. Although this approach disregards the
exact stoichiometric properties of metabolic reactions, our
method is not susceptible to problems known to occur when
using purely topology-based procedures (de Figueiredo et al.,
2008).

To outline the beneﬁt of ASBIG, selected reconstructions from
the following organisms were examined: E.coli, Arabidopsis thali-
ana, Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Bacillus subtilis, Chlamydomonas
reinhardtii, and Zea mays (Table 1). Using our method, we were
able to identify missing pathways in all of these networks except
for the E.coli reconstruction. Subsequently, the detected incon-
sistencies were resolved using information from the KEGG data-
base (Kanehisa et al., 2006) and other resources, like BioCyc,

BsubCyc (Caspi et al., 2010) or the Plant metabolic pathway
database (Zhang et al., 2010). Furthermore, all available recon-
structions of the Model SEED project (Henry et al., 2010) have
been screened to demonstrate the applicability of the method on
a large scale. As one substantial beneﬁt of this screening,
common inconsistencies widespread across numerous models
were identiﬁed. Additionally, ASBIG detected missing reactions
that were deleted manually from the model of E.coli for valid-
ation purposes, demonstrating the reliability and applicability of
our method.

In summary, ASBIG is a reliable method for the detection
of inconsistencies in any metabolic network reconstruction.
It provides an efﬁcient approach to validate metabolic models.
By pinpointing discrepancies of network reconstructions, the
method supports the improvement of the high number of incom-
plete models generated by high-throughput methods. Thus,
ASBIG can signiﬁcantly contribute to improve the quality of
metabolic network reconstructions.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS
2.1 Models

ASBIG uses a genome-scale reconstruction of metabolic networks as
input. It was applied to investigate the following models: iJOl366
of E.coli K-12 MG1655, iBSU1103 of B.sabtilis 168, AraGEM of
A.thaliana, iRC1080 of C.reinhara'tii, iMM904 of S.cerevisiae and
DTMaize_C4GEM_45632 of Z.mays. Additionally, >190 models
provided by the Model SEED project Oienry et al., 2010) (as available
in October 2012) were screened.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of autocatalytic metabolic sets

The algorithm was implemented in JAVA. Genome-scale metabolic
networks are processed in the standardized Systems Biology Markup
Language using the JAVA package jigcell.sbml2 W ass et al., 2004).

2.3 Initial set of metabolites (seed set)

A predeﬁned set of metabolites, named ‘initial seed set’, acts as the start-
ing point for ASBIG. It combines the components of a nutritional
medium with additional pivotal elements. The set of additional elements
is composed of two subsets: metabolites identiﬁed as crucial by ASBIG
(see Section 3.1) and autocatalytic compounds whose biosynthesis
depends on their own presence (cf. Kun et al., 2008). These were as
follows: Adenosine triphosphate (ATP), nicotinamide adenine dinucleo-
tide (NAD) and coenzyme A (CoA).

Hence, the composition of the initial seed set is assumed to include all
essential components necessary for the growth of the organism.

2.4 Scope analysis

ASBIG uses the concept of scopes (Handorf et al., 2005), which can be
determined for a given sets of metabolites. The scope is a (large) set of
metabolites and corresponds to all compounds that can, in principle, be
produced from a (small) predeﬁned set of metabolites. The concept of
scope analysis relies on three aspects mandorf et al., 2005) (i) a reaction is
considered to take place if all of its substrates (or products in the case of
reversible reactions) have non-zero concentrations, (ii) products of one
reaction are immediately considered as potential substrates of another
one and (iii) starting with a small set of metabolites, iteratively increasing
sets of reactions (and metabolites) are generated by screening the model
for further reactions with a non-zero ﬂux. The fundamental principle

of ASBIG relies on the calculation of a scope set based on a given seed set
of metabolites.

2.5 Biomass reaction

An essential feature among most network reconstructions is the biomass
reaction, which is crucial for the ASBIG method. During a run of
ASBIG, this reaction is used as a benchmark to evaluate generated
metabolite sets. The biomass reaction constitutes a hypothetical reaction
within the model that includes all metabolites necessary for the growth of
the corresponding organism as substrate (biomass compounds). Usually,
it is an essential element of FBA (Feist and Palsson, 2010). For ASBIG,
it is reasonable to use this reaction as benchmark and compare metabolite
sets based on their ability, to provide access to the biomass compounds.
A seed set cannot be considered as adequate for the corresponding
organisms until all biomass compounds are within the scope of the
seed set.

2.6 Expanded seed set

Given the initial seed set, not all biomass compounds are necessarily part
of the computed scope. Hence, the initial seed set is insufﬁcient and needs

Fig. 2. Scenario to illustrate the necessity of a random approach to
minimize the extended seed set. A and B represent initial metabolites,
whereas C is an add-on compound. Light gray circles symbolize inter-
mediates of the depicted pathways, and the dark gray circles represent
biomass compounds. Dashed arrows hint further reaction routes. A and
B together lead to the same biomass components as the availability of C.
If, for example, A is deleted in the second phase of ASBIG, B alone lacks
the potential to maintain the producibility of the two biomass com-
pounds. Consequently, C would emerge in the ﬁnal minimal seed set

to be expanded to generate a scope comprising all biomass components.
Iteratively, metabolites, named ‘aa’d—on metabolites’, are added using a
greedy approach. In each iteration, each metabolite that is not within
the previously calculated scope is considered and inserted into the
extended seed set on a trial basis. Finally, the compound, which results
in the biggest increase of scope size represents the add-on metabolite of
this iteration and remains in the extended seed set (independent of its
impact on the biomass function). To this end, a scope analysis has to be
performed for each metabolite, which was not part of the previously
computed scope. If two metabolites yield an identical increase in scope
size, the smaller metabolite in terms of the number of carbon atoms is
chosen. Subsequently, a scope analysis is conducted with the temporary
expanded seed set. The expansion process stops when the current
expanded seed set results in a scope set that comprises all biomass com-
pounds (Fig. 1 A and B).

2.7 Determining the minimal seed set

Most likely, not every metabolite of the expanded seed set contributes
signiﬁcantly to biomass production. For this reason, we aimed to deter-
mine a minimal seed set in terms of size during the second phase of
ASBIG (Fig. 1C). To minimize the size of the expanded seed set, each
element is removed on trial, and the scope of the remaining seed set is
computed. If all biomass compounds are still within the scope, the elem-
ent remains removed, otherwise it is reinserted. Potential dependencies
between compounds of the expanded seed set impede a deterministic
strategy to remove elements from the expanded seed set. Alternatively,
a strategy accomplishing randomized removal of seed compounds is
applied—with respect to one constraint: Elements of the initial seed set
(depicted as light gray squares in Fig. 1) were prioritized and were only
examined once all other add-on metabolites (dark gray squares in Fig. 1)
have been tested (random removal with priorities). Unconstrained ran-
domized removal can be critical, as the following example illustrates
(Fig. 2): Three metabolites, A, B, and C, are included in the expanded
seed set. A and B are initially given compounds, whereas C was appended
as add-on metabolite. C, self-evidently, enlarges the scope size. However,
the enlargement may not affect the biomass production (Fig. 2A and B
together unlock the same biomass compounds as the presence of C)
In other words, C constitutes an add-on metabolite, because of its
impact on the scope size, but C is not necessary for biomass production.
However, in case of an unconstrained random approach to calculate the
minimal seed set, it is two times more likely that C remains in the minimal
seed set: if and only if C is deleted ﬁrst, A and B remain in the minimal
seed set. In the two remaining cases of primary deletion of A or B, C will

Fig. 3. Visualization of the minimal seed set generation. Beginning with
the extended seed set, the method computes 100 (potentially different)
minimal seed sets with the constrained random procedure as described.
Out of these, the most prevalent compound(s) (depicted in black) are
marked as inherent part of the emerging minimal seed set and are not
considered in following iterations. Within these, the procedure is repeated
until the set of ﬁxed elements is capable of producing a scope that com-
prises all biomass components (bottom part)

be part of the minimal seed set to ensure the accessibility of the relevant
biomass compounds. This would be in contrast to the basic principle of
ASBIG to retain the initial metabolites. To minimize this bias, all com-
ponents of the initial seed set are prioritized.

This illustrates the problem of dependencies between different com-
pounds of the seed set, which, of course, can occur between any subset of
metabolites.

To account for such properties of the expanded seed set, the actual
implementation comprises two iteratively repeated steps: During the ﬁrst
step, a distinct number of runs of random removal with priorities is
performed to generate a pool of potential minimal seed sets (possibly,
all potential minimal seed sets are different). For the analyses presented
here, 100 runs were performed in one cycle. In the second step, the tem-
porary minimal seed sets are evaluated and the metabolite(s) with the
maximal number of occurrences is (are) marked as deﬁnite element(s)
of the ﬁnal minimal seed set (marked in black in step 2 of Fig. 3).
Subsequently, ﬁxed metabolites are not removed on trial anymore in
the following iterations. Instead, they constitute an invariant part of
every temporary minimal seed set once they have been ﬁxed. In the
next iteration, only the remaining compounds of the expanded seed set
are removed on trial. The procedure is repeated until the set of ﬁxed
metabolites is capable of generating a scope that includes all biomass
compounds.

To obtain more information about the reasons why a speciﬁc metab-
olite occurs in the seed set, it can be beneﬁcial to repeat the workﬂow
using a slightly different approach (‘proa’acibility constraint’). The differ-
ence to the default procedure is an additional constraint during seed set
expansion restricting the possibility of any considered compound to
become part of the expanded seed set. More precisely, each metabolite
outside the previously computed scope is considered as putative add-on
metabolite only if its corresponding scope contains a reaction that ensures
the production of the metabolite.

The described change in the workﬂow is not part of the default pref-
erences. It is left to the user whether an additional run with the altered
approach is required.

2.8 Final minimal seed set

ASBIG computes a ﬁnal minimal seed set, whose scope set includes all
biomass compounds. The minimal seed set consists of two major parts:
initially given metabolites and add-on metabolites. The incorporated add-
on metabolites can be divided into two major classes: (i) metabolites
described in Section 3.1, which are elementary because of the structure
of the model and not of principal interest, and (ii) metabolites, which
show an autocatalytic behavior and embody a pivotal part of the metab-
olism. These compounds constitute the crucial result of ASBIG, as their
presence in the minimal seed set indicates potential gaps within the meta-
bolic network reconstruction.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We developed a new method to detect inconsistencies in meta-
bolic network reconstructions. The key step in this method
is the identiﬁcation of metabolites, which are necessary to
‘unlock’ speciﬁc metabolic pathways, that is, to make them
accessible. Such metabolites usually represent cofactors that
are required, besides the substrate of a pathway, to produce
the corresponding products. As outlined above, although a
wide range of metabolites of a biochemical network can usu-
ally be produced from a small set of precursor metabolites, an
additional set of cofactors such as ATP and NAD is required
to make most of metabolism accessible. The central goal of
our approach is to identify these cofactors, which we call auto-
catalytic compounds, for a speciﬁc network and compare them
with the usually well-conserved set of autocatalytic compounds
of other metabolic models. If uncommon autocatalytic com-
pounds are identiﬁed, this can usually be regarded as an indi-
cator of missing metabolic functionality in a network
reconstruction.

Figure 1 depicts the methodical procedure. First, the recon-
struction of interest is examined via scope analysis with a prede-
ﬁned initial seed set (always containing the same metabolites
regardless of the metabolic model investigated). This initial
seed set is incrementally expanded by additional compounds
until all biomass components are included in the computed meta-
bolic scope (leading to an expanded metabolic seed set, Fig. 1B).
Each compound added, named add-on metabolite, unlocks
certain pathways in the model and leads to a larger metabolic
scope. However, not every add-on metabolite contributes to the
biomass production. Hence, in the last step of the ASBIG
analysis, the expanded seed set is minimized to the minimal set
of compounds required for biomass production (Fig. 1C).

In summary, for every metabolic reconstruction, a minimal set
of metabolites is computed. This minimal set allows the produc-
tion of all biomass components and consists of initially given
metabolites and a subset of add-on metabolites (see 2.8).
As prerequisite for each model investigation, it is assumed that
those parts of the model that are necessary for the biomass pro-
duction can be unlocked with the initially given metabolites.
However, this assumption was not true for most investigated
metabolic reconstructions and add-on metabolites had to be
included. Each add-on metabolite has the capacity to provide
access to priorly blocked parts of metabolism, and thus, uncovers
putative gaps within a metabolic network reconstruction.

Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies

 

3.1 Commonly identiﬁed inconsistencies in multiple
reconstructions

Initial runs of ASBIG indicated the presence of common
autocatalytic compounds in all (or at least the majority of) the
investigated metabolic models. This observation was a conse-
quence of similar features among different models. Often,
protein-derived reaction components, like the cofactor thiore—
doxin or the cofactor-carrying acyl carrier protein (ACP), were
implemented as discrete compounds. However, biosynthesis of
ribosomal protein is not included in most metabolic network
reconstructions. As a result, these protein-derived compounds
were present in the minimal seed set. Occasionally, metabolites
that require protein-derived compounds for their biosynthesis
appeared in the minimal seed set. Their assignment to the cor-
responding protein—derived compound involved additional
effort, which could be avoided by integrating the protein-derived
reaction components in the initial seed set.

Another metabolite identiﬁed by ASBIG in several network
reconstructions was dihydrolipoamide. In these models, dihydro-
lipoamide was part of small isolated reaction cycles, excluding its
own de novo biosynthesis. Hence, dihydrolipoamide and other
commonly identiﬁed metabolites could be regarded as autocata-
lytic, although the lack of their biosynthetic pathways repre-
sented a common ﬂaw of the corresponding metabolic
networks. Consequently, the compounds were added to the
initial seed set for subsequent analyses (see supplementary infor-
mation for a complete list of initial seed set compounds).

3.2 Application to selected reconstructions

3.2.1 Escherichia coli The metabolism of E.c0li is well
investigated and the associated metabolic reconstruction is one
of the best-curated models (Orth et al., 2011). Accordingly, no
peculiarities or gaps were detected by ASBIG.

3.2.2 Arabidopsis thaliana ASBIG identiﬁed several inconsis-
tencies in the A.thaliarta model. The presence of cytosolic nico-
tinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP) in the
minimal seed set unraveled the lack of a NAD phosphorylation
reaction in the cytosol. Similarly, plastidic NADP turned out to
be autocatalytic because of its metabolic connection to plastidic
hexadecanoic acid (palmitic acid), which was also found in the
minimal seed set.

Plant hexadecanoic acid production involves the NADH-
dependent reduction of trans-2—hexadecenoyl-ACP to hexadeca-
noyl-ACP. However, the insertion of plastidic NAD, ACP and
CoA did not result in the biosynthesis of hexadecanoic acid.
Instead, plastidic NADP that is required in its reduced form
(NADPH) during the reduction of oxohexadecanoyl-ACP to
hydroxypalmitoyl—ACP was present in the minimal seed set.
Thus, plastidic CoA, ACP, NADH and NADPH are crucial
factors to enable fatty acid biosynthesis in the A.thaliarta
model. However, the requirement of NADPH in addition to
NADH was unexpected and had to be resolved through detailed
manual network analysis.

The requirement of both plastidic and cytosolic NADPH
suggested a gap in the phosphorylation process of NAD. The
A.thaliarta genome contains two genes coding for NAD kinases,
which are annotated as NADKl and NADK2 (Turner et al.,

localized in the cytosol and plastid stoma, respectively Waller
et al., 2010). The reactions catalyzed by theses enzymes
(EC 2.7.1.23) were absent in the metabolic reconstruction of
A.thaliarta, and NADPH lost its autocatalytic property by
adding the reaction EC 2.7.1.23 to the cytosol and to the plastidic
stoma compartment. Consequently, plastidic and cytosolic
NADPH was not detected in the minimal seed set anymore.

3.2.3 Bacillus subtilis Applying ASBIG to zBSU1103, the meta-
bolic network model of B.sabtilis, revealed two pathways with
deﬁcient or no accessibility: cell wall biosynthesis and thiamine
biosynthesis.

Although the relevant genes for thiamine biosynthesis in
B.sabtilis are known (Lawhorn et al., 2004), the corresponding
pathway was not present in zBSU1103. As a result, thiamine was
an inevitable component of the minimal seed set. Adding the
thiamine biosynthetic pathway resulted in a gain of functionality
for the model and the elimination of thiamine from the minimal
seed set.

In addition to thiamine, geranylgeranyl diphosphate (PP) and
glycerol teichoic acid were part of the ﬁnal minimal seed set.
In the model, geranylgeranyl PP is the direct precursor of
undecaprenyl PP (UDPP), which is an intermediate in the
biosynthesis of the cell wall components peptidoglycan (PGL)
and teichoic acid (Fig. 4, EC 2.7.8.13 and EC 2.7.8.33)
(Swoboda et al., 2010). Hence, geranylgeranyl PP and glycerol
teichoic acid were required in the minimal seed set for the cell
wall biosynthesis.

The corresponding pathways in the model were examined
to resolve the need for the two compounds. The teichoic acid
biosynthetic pathway was implemented in zBSU1103. However,
teichoic acid synthesis remained locked in a scope analysis
with the initial seed set owing to the unavailability of UDPP.
As mentioned above, geranylgeranyl PP is assigned as the direct
precursor of UDPP in the zBSU1103 model. In contrast, the
database BsubCyc indicates trans,trarts—farnesyl PP as the
precursor of UDPP (BsubCyc: di-trans,poly—cis-undecaprenyl
phosphate biosynthesis). Furthermore, the gene appS in
B.sabtillis encodes an UDPP synthase (Inaoka and Ochi,

2012), which requires trans,trarts—farnesyl PP to produce UDPP
(EC 2.5.1.31, Fig. 4). Apparently, the reaction EC 2.5.1.31 of the
model included an incorrect substrate assignment leading to the
substrate incorporation into the minimal seed set, a conﬂicting
minimal seed metabolite. The exchange of geranylgeranyl PP
with trans,trarts—farnesyl PP in the reaction EC 2.5.1.31 resolved
the need for the conﬂicting minimal seed metabolite and
geranylgeranyl PP was eliminated from the minimal seed set.
The identiﬁcation of conﬂicting minimal seed metabolites dem-
onstrates the ability of ASBIG to detect wrongly implemented
reactants.

Despite the modiﬁcation of reaction EC 2.5.1.31, teichoic acid
remained in the minimal seed set because of its ability to provide
the PGL polymer to the metabolic scope (the backward reaction
of EC. 3.6.3.40 removes teichoic acid from PGL, Fig. 4).
To avoid this property of teichoic acid, a reaction, which trans-
forms multiple PGL monomers to a polymer, was implemented
in the model (Fig. 4, light gray dashed arrow). As a result, no
polymers had to be provided as self-replicators anymore, and
teichoic acid was eliminated from the ﬁnal minimal seed set.
To sum up, the application of ASBIG substantially improved
the integrity of the Bsubtilis model zBSU1103 leading to a
more comprehensive representation of the in vivo metabolism.
Furthermore, the investigation of iBSU1103 illustrates central
characteristics of the method: computed add-on metabolites not
necessarily indicate the corresponding pathway or speciﬁc loca-
tion of an inconsistency, and the results generated by ASBIG can
suggest the inclusion of further functionality for the model.

3.2.4 Chlamydomonas reinhardtii The minimal seed set for
iRC1080, the metabolic model of C.reirthara’tii, contained
add-on metabolites that indicated the lack of functionalities
in some biosynthetic pathways. To access all components
of the biomass reaction, thiamine, glutathione, chorismate,
magnesium-protoporphyrin IX 13-monomethyl ester and
plastidic plastoquinone expanded the initial seed set.

The biosynthesis for thiamine was not implemented in the
model, likely because critical parts of the pathway still require
experimental conﬁrmation (Moulin et al., 2013). However, the
basic metabolic routes of de novo thiamine biosynthesis in
C.reirthara’tii are known, and the corresponding reactions could
be added to the model. After the implementation, thiamine lost
its autocatalytic property.

The presence of glutathione in the minimal seed set could be
linked to the biosynthetic pathway of cysteine. Assimilatory sul-
fate reduction in C.reirthara’tii depends on glutathione and leads
to the generation of hydrogen sulﬁde. Subsequently, hydrogen
sulﬁde can be incorporated into 0-acetyl-L-serine to form cyst-
eine. Hence, it was assumed that hydrogen sulﬁde, glutathione
or cysteine were required to be part of the minimal seed set.
Three runs of ASBIG, each with one out of the three compo-
nents in the initial seed set, conﬁrmed this assumption
(and resulted, for hydrogen sulﬁde and cysteine, in the replace-
ment of glutathione in the minimal seed set).

It was further possible to identify an impaired biosynthesis of
chlorophyllide a explaining the presence of protoporphyrin IX
13-monomethyl ester in the minimal seed set. S—adenosyl-
L-methionine (SAM) was one of the substrates to produce the
protoporphyrin ester. Hence, another run of ASBIG was

performed with SAM included in the initial seed set. This led
to the removal of protoporphyrin IX 13-monomethyl ester,
implicating the relevance of SAM.

The essential character for both plastidic SAM and cytosolic
chorismate could be explained with a missing transport reaction
between plastid and cytosol or missing biosynthetic pathways in
one of the compartments. A putative transport enzyme could
overcome this lack in both cases, even though no such trans-
porters have been identiﬁed in C.reirthara’tii yet. However, an
enzyme to import SAM into the chloroplast was reported for
A.thaliarta (Bouvier et al., 2006). Therefore, the ﬁndings of
ASBIG highlight the need for further investigations of the meta-
bolic capabilities of C.reirthardtii.

The putative plastoquinone biosynthetic pathway for
C.reirthara’tii is available in the KEGG database (KEGG: ubi-
quinone and other terpenoid-quinone biosynthesis). As it was
not integrated in the investigated C.reirthara’tii metabolic
model, plastoquinone possessed autocatalytic property. Despite
the lack of experimental evidence, the pathway was added to the
model. First, the network reconstruction had to be expanded by
two metabolites previously not implemented: nonaprenyl PP and
2-methyl-6-solanyl—1,4—benzoquinol. Nonaprenyl PP is the prod-
uct of the reaction of geranylgeranyl PP with ﬁve molecules of
isopentenyl PP (catalyzed by EC 2.5.1.85). Subsequently, nona-
prenyl PP reacts with homogentisate to form 2-methyl—6—solanyl-
1,4—benzoquinol (Merchant et al., 2007), which is further
converted to plastoquinone in a SAM-dependent reaction.
The enzyme involved in the plastoquinone formation is not yet
characterized, however, it is assumed that VT E3 codes for the
corresponding enzyme (Merchant et al., 2007). By adding
the aforementioned metabolic reactions to the C.reirthara’tii
model, plastoquinone lost its autocatalytic property and was
eliminated from the minimal seed set.

The results for the examined network reconstruction of
C.reirthara’tii, iRC1080, show the versatile capabilities
of ASBIG, for example, to identify inconsistencies that require
additional experimental investigation as shown for the case of
SAM or chorismate.

3.2.5 Saccharomyces cerevisiae In the S.cerevisiae model
iMM904, dolichol was identiﬁed as a crucial add-on metabolite
of the minimal seed set, implying an impaired biosynthesis of
the compound. A survey of the metabolic model conﬁrmed the
absence of the corresponding pathway, although the biosynthesis
of dolichol in S.cerevisiae has been previously described
(Grabiriska and Palamarczyk, 2002). To implement the meta-
bolic route in the network reconstruction, several additions
were required: (i) the condensation of farnesyl PP with 13 units
of isopentenyl pyrophosphate to form polyprenyl PP (EC
2.5.1.87), (ii) the formation of polyprenol from polyprenyl PP
and water (both polyprenyl PP and polyprenol had to be imple-
mented as novel compounds in the model) and (iii) the conver-
sion of polyprenol to dolichol. Manual expansion of the network
reconstruction of S.cerevisiae provided access to the novel bio-
synthetic pathway of dolichol, thus eliminating the compound
from the minimal seed set.

Another unexpected metabolite in the minimal seed set
was NADP located in the endoplasmatic reticulum (ER).
This compound remained in the minimal seed set because of

Computing autocatalytic sets to unravel inconsistencies

 

the lack of information on a potential pathway providing NADP
in the ER.

Even though dolichol is the only gap-indicating add-on
metabolite, the identiﬁcation of NADP as an autocatalytic com-
pound suggests general inconsistencies of the model.

3.2.6 Zea mays Application of ASBIG to the Z.mays model
DTMaize_C4GEM_45632 revealed four add-on metabolites in
the ﬁnal minimal seed set that required further investigation:
thiamine, NADP, undecaprenyl phosphate (UDP), and
4-methylthio-2—oxobutanoate (all localized in the cytosol).

Although maize is capable of thiamine biosynthesis, the
pathway has not yet been fully characterized (Belanger et al.,
1995), and thus, is not entirely represented within the metabolic
network model. As a result, the biosynthetic route of thiamine
was blocked and thiamine had to be incorporated in the minimal
seed set. With the future availability of novel information, the
model can be improved by additionally including this speciﬁc
biosynthetic pathway.

The absence of a cytosolic NAD kinase necessitated NADP to
be an element of the minimal seed set. However, transcriptome
analysis and automated annotation suggested the existence
of a functional NAD kinase in Z.mays (UniProt ID:
B6TAB2_MAIIZE) (Alexandrov et al., 2009). Therefore, the re-
action (EC 2.7.1.23) was added leading to the elimination of
NADP from the minimal seed set.

Subsequently, the crucial character of UDP was examined
and a missing reaction to phosphorylate uridine 5’-phosphate
(UMP) to UDP in UTP biosynthetic pathway was identiﬁed.
As for the NAD kinase, transcriptome data and electronic
annotation (UniProt ID: B6T904_MAIZE) (Alexandrov
et al., 2009) suggested the presence of a functional UMP
kinase. Hence, the detected gap could be resolved by imple-
menting the additional reaction, thus eliminating UDP from
the minimal seed set.

The application of the more restrictive ‘producibility
constraint’ during the seed set expansion (see Section 2) allowed
to link the autocatalytic metabolite 4-methylthio-2—oxobutanoate
with the biosynthetic pathway of methionine. 4-Methylthio-
2-oxobutanoate was part of the minimal seed set owing to its
ability to bypass a blocked canonical methionine biosynthetic
pathway (KEGG: map00270). It was assumed that a limited
availability of cysteine, an essential intermediate in the methio-
nine biosynthesis, caused the blocked methionine production
(see also cysteine biosynthesis in C.reirthara’tii). By adding
cysteine to the initial seed set, folate instead of 4-methylthio-
2-oxobutanoate was represented as an essential add-on metabol-
ite of the minimal seed set. Evidently, the canonical methionine
biosynthetic pathway was inaccessible unless cysteine and folate
(or precursors/intermediates of the corresponding pathways)
were part of the minimal seed set. A derivative of folate, the
methyl group donor methyltetrahydropteroyltri-L-glutamate, is
vital for the last step of the methionine biosynthesis (Hanson
and Gregory, 2011). However, the biosynthesis of folate and
its derivatives was impaired in the model, likely because the
in vivo pathway is not yet fully understood (Hesse et al., 2004),
leading to the inevitable role of folate. Comparable with thia-
mine, the implementation of the biosynthetic pathway in the

model depends on additional experiments to elucidate folate bio-
synthesis in Z.mays.

Another inconsistency in the last step of the methionine bio-
synthesis was identiﬁed: According to literature, the triglutamate
of methyltetrahydrofolate (MeTHF), methyltetrahydropteroyl-
tri-L-glutamate, acts as the substrate for the methionine
synthase (EC 2.1.1.14) (Eckermann et al., 2000; Eichel et al.,
1995). In the Z.mays model, this enzyme used ‘pure’ MeTHF
as methyl donor (Fig. 4), indicating a conﬂicting minimal seed
metabolite. Additionally, another methionine-producing
reaction (EC 2.4.2.7), which involved methyltetrahydropteroyl-
tri-L-glutamate as substrate, was available. However, the latter
reaction was misassigned, as the denoted EC number character-
izes an adenine phosphoribosyltransferase (EC 2.4.2.7).
Thus, methyltetrahydropteroyltri-L-glutamate was implemented
as substrate for the methionine synthase (EC 2.1.1.14), and
the redundant misassigned reaction (EC 2.4.2.7) was deleted.
As the Z.mays model lacked the reactions necessary for the
transfer of the single carbon to tetrahydropteroyltri-L- glutamate,
the triglutamate of MeTHF replaced folate (precursor of
MeTHF) in the ﬁnal minimal seed set. Although the exact mech-
anism of the methyl group transfer is not completely character-
ized for plants, the basic pathway composed of two reactions
is known (Ravanel et al., 1998). Hence, the pathway was imple-
mented in the model to connect methyltetrahydropteroyltri-
L—glutamate with the folate metabolism. Subsequently, folate
and cysteine were part of the minimal seed set again and enabled
methionine biosynthesis.

Each of the four identiﬁed add-on metabolites indicates substan-
tial restrictions in the Z.mays model DTMaize_C4GEM_45632.
Even though not each issue could be resolved, the results of
ASBIG provide valuable indications to the Z.mays model for
improvements.

3.3 Application to automatically reconstructed networks

To further scrutinize the ability of ASBIG to improve the
consistency of metabolic network reconstructions, we analyzed
193 genome-scale metabolic networks, which have been recon-
structed automatically based on the organisms’ genome
sequences and genomic annotations (Henry et al., 2010).
Among all models, 234 different metabolites were identiﬁed as
crucial elements in the ﬁnal minimal seed set after adding them
during scope analysis. This list of compounds suggested that
reactions were possibly missing in the biosynthetic pathways
linked to these metabolites (Supplementary Table S1). A median
of 6 additional compounds per model, necessary to facilitate bio-
mass production, was identiﬁed (Supplementary Fig. S2). In 69%
of all models, PGL polymer (n—1 subunits) was identiﬁed as an
inevitable compound. Peptidoglycan polymers are found in the
membranes of bacteria and occur with a varying number of sub-
units Wollmer and Holtje, 2004). The elongation and shortening
of this polymer are included in the models, but not the de novo
biosynthesis. Furthermore, in multiple models, which were ana-
lyzed by ASBIG, external spermidine (47%), the glutamate-ac-
cepting tRNA (26%), thiamine (24%), external alanylhistidine
(22%) and glycyl-L-asparagine (21%) were frequently identiﬁed
as compounds that could not be synthesized. The recurrence of
these compounds might be owing to missing knowledge of

possible biosynthetic routes or owing to properties of the recon-
struction process (all 193 automated reconstructions analyzed
here were generated using the same procedure) (Henry et al.,
2010). On the other hand, 194 of the 243 compounds were identi-
ﬁed in <5% of all automated reconstructions analyzed, suggesting
model-speciﬁc gaps or errors in the reconstruction or actual
auxotrophies of the organisms.

Taken together, our analysis of a wide range of different auto-
matically reconstructed metabolic networks reveals that several
metabolites have an autocatalytic property or are inevitable for
biomass production. The identiﬁcation of these autocatalytic
metabolites using ASBIG can improve the quality of the recon-
struction by suggesting that the de novo biosynthetic pathways of
the identiﬁed metabolites are either incomplete or missing.

3.4 Validation of ASBIG 0n auxotrophic mutants of
E.coli

As mentioned above, no gaps were identiﬁed in the E.c0li
model iJOl366. Using this network, we knocked out reactions,
recalculated the minimal seed set and compared the changes
with reported experimental phenotypes of single-gene deletion
mutants of E.c0li K12 derivatives (Bertels et al., 2012). Using
this approach, we were able to validate ASBIG in terms of the
method’s potential to predict gene essentiality as well as altered
nutritional requirements of mutants compared with the wild
type strain. We deleted 10 reactions, one at the time, each
one in the biosynthetic pathways of a speciﬁc amino acid.
The deleted reactions correspond to gene deletions, which are
known to cause a speciﬁc auxotrophy for the focal amino acid
of the mutant strain (Bertels et al., 2012). For each of the
mutated networks, ASBIG identiﬁed an add-on metabolite,
which was necessary to ensure biomass production. The add-
on metabolite was the ﬁnal product (the amino acid) of the
affected pathway, an intermediate within the pathway or a
derivative of the focal amino acid (for an overview see
Supplementary Table S2). Hence, the output of ASBIG reﬂects
the auxotrophy of the mutant strain impressively demonstrat-
ing the capability of ASBIG to detect gaps within primary
metabolic pathways.

4 CONCLUSION

In conclusion, ASBIG is an efﬁcient method for detecting incon-
sistencies in existing genome-scale metabolic network reconstruc-
tions. The method facilitates network validation and automated
gap detection in primary metabolism contributing considerably
to the quality improvement of metabolic models. ASBIG com-
bines the conceptual approaches of autocatalytic metabolites and
scope analysis, thereby allowing to test network reconstructions
for their integrity. For each investigated metabolic model, a min-
imal seed set of metabolites, which provides access to all funda-
mental metabolic pathways, is computed. Putative ﬂaws of the
model can be deduced directly from identiﬁed minimal seed set.

The beneﬁt of ASBIG was demonstrated by investigating
different metabolic models. In the closely examined models, nu-
merous kinds of errors could be identiﬁed including i) missing
reactions, ii) missing pathways or iii) gaps caused by insufﬁcient
knowledge of metabolic processes. Furthermore, not only single

gaps in individual models were identiﬁed, but also common ﬂaws
simultaneously present in several network reconstructions, could
be detected in a large screen of 190 network reconstructions.

In contrast to the commonly applied gap-ﬁnding approach
(i.e. deriving putative gaps from the calculated ﬂux distribu-
tions), ASBIG is a simple method and detects other types of
inconsistencies. Hence, the application of ASBIG contributes
signiﬁcantly to model reﬁnement and validation representing a
complementary approach to existing gap-ﬁnding methods.

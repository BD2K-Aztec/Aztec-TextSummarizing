Abstract

Motivation: Structure of most proteins is flexible. Identification and analysis of intramolecular mo—
tions is a complex problem. Breaking a structure into relatively rigid parts, the so—called dynamic
domains, may help comprehend the complexity of protein’s mobility. We propose a new approach
called ResiCon (Residue Contacts analysis), which performs this task by applying a data—mining
analysis of an ensemble of protein configurations and recognizes dynamic domains, hinges and
interfacial regions, by considering contacts between residues.

Results: Dynamic domains found by ResiCon are more compact than those identified by two other
popular methods: PiSQRD and GeoStaS. The current analysis was carried out using a known refer—
ence set of 30 NMR protein structures, as well as molecular dynamics simulation data of flap open—
ing events in HIV—1 protease. The more detailed analysis of HIV—1 protease dataset shows that
ResiCon identified dynamic domains involved in structural changes of functional importance.

1 Introduction

 

OXFORD

Domains in traditional sense are regarded as parts of the protein

Proteins are not static. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spec—
troscopy (Martin and Zektzer, 1988) and the spin—echo spectros—
copy (Bu and Callaway,2011) experiments show that in several
cases it was proven that flexibility may be crucial to protein func-
tionality (Farago et 61]., 2010; Hamelberg and McCammon., 2005).
Although experimental methods provide only general clues about
intramolecular motions, molecular dynamics (MD) simulations ex—
tend their reach by giving a higher—resolution picture—both in space
and time—of protein mobility. By studying an NMR ensemble or
MD trajectory one may notice that it is composed of relatively rigid
structural parts, often referred to as dynamic domains (Hayward
et al., 1997).

which are: conserved (in terms of evolution), autonomous (in terms
of folding) and/0r compact (in terms of tertiary structure). Such
‘static’ domains are identified through sequence homology, struc—
tural analysis of a single configuration or both. (For conventional
methods of identifying protein domains based on multiple sequences
or a single structure see e.g. Bork, 1991; Richardson 1981.)
Conversely, dynamic domains depend on structural transitions
performed by the protein.

A number of methods for identification of dynamic domains
have been developed. The simplest procedures are based on normal
mode analysis, which assumes a harmonic approximation of the po—
tential energy function (Hinsen, 1998). More advanced approaches

use the Gaussian Network Model and analyze correlations in mo-
tions between the residues of the protein (Yesylevskyy et al., 2006).
Many other approaches have also been developed (Bahar et al.,
1997; Bernhard et al., 2010; Genoni et al., 2012; Potestio et al.,
2009; Wriggers and Schulten, 1997), but all of them anticipate dy—
namic domains by analyzing a single structure of a protein. Another
class of methods for dynamic domains assignment requires exactly
two configurations (see Hayward and Berendsen, 1998; Lee et al.,
2003; Ye and Godzik, 2003). However, the assumption that two
‘representative’ structures encompass all relevant motions is rather
speculative.

Experimental and in silico methods reach beyond single—struc—
ture representation, and are capable of producing numerous config—
urations of a given protein. Rather than inferring dynamic domains
from one or two structures, a more natural approach would be to
determine them based on an ensemble of configurations. GeoStaS is
the only method known to us that analyzes a whole ensemble of
configurations and assigns each residue to a dynamic domain
(Romanowska et al., 2012). Although GeoStaS can analyze not only
proteins, but also nucleic acids, it fails to discover dynamic domains
whenever they rotate with respect to each other. Alternative meth—
ods of analyzing ensembles of configurations assign residues to a
static ‘core’ or unstructured bundle (see Kirchner and Guntert,
2011; Snyder and Montelione, 2005).

The purpose of this study was to develop a novel methodology
named ResiCon, capable of extracting dynamic domains from an en-
semble of protein’s configurations. ResiCon analyzes strengths of
contacts between residues based exclusively on geometrical changes
occurring in the provided set of structures. The set may be an NMR
ensemble of configurations, or snapshots produced in the course of
an MD simulation. ResiCon’s main functionality is to identify
dynamic domains, but it can also find hinges and interfacial
(interdomain) regions.

2 Approach

ResiCon starts with identifying pairs of residues which are in con-
tact. There are several definitions of contacts between amino—acid
residues in the literature. We used the definition presented in
Daniluk and Lesyng (2011) and adapted it to the case when more
than one structure is given (see also Daniluk and Lesyng 2014).

Next, ResiCon constructs a virtual scaffold, connecting residues
which are in contact with bars. Stiffness of a given bar reﬂects the
estimated strength of the corresponding contact.

Finally, to identify dynamic domains, ResiCon carries out a par—
titioning (by computing minimal cuts) of the scaffold, cutting
weaker and preserving stiffer bars. This partitioning is carried out
by applying a spectral clustering algorithm presented in the follow—
ing section.

The fundamental underlying assumption is that stability of rigid
parts results from stable interactions between its residues. However,
in our approach we do not analyze physical interactions between
residues—they may be hydrophobic, electrostatic or significant in
some other way. We simply assume that the measure of strength of a
contact between residues is reflected by their geometrical variability
across a given sample of structures.

3 Methods

Throughout this article we use terms: model, conﬁguration, struc-
ture and conformation interchangeably. We will refer to a set of

structures acquired from an MD trajectory or NMR experiment as
the ensemble of conﬁgurations or simply: an ensemble. Let us denote
the number of structures in an ensemble by S.

3.1 Residue contact

For each pair of residues in every model we compute distances be—
tween Ca atoms (dd) and between geometrical centers of side—chains
RC (dc) (for glycine RC : C0,, and for alanine RC : Cg). We say
that two residues are in contact, if at least one configuration in the
ensemble satisfies the condition:

(d,g6.5A) or (dC38A and da—dC20.75A) (1)

Threshold values are the same as in definition of contact presented
in Daniluk and Lesyng (2011) and relate to the range of distances in
which physical interactions between residues occur. The second sub—
condition favors residues whose side—chains point toward each other
(see Fig. 1). Residues that are sequential neighbors are not taken
into account.

We assign a quantitative value to the strength of a contact in
terms of geometrical variability of the structural part associated
with that contact. Such measure is required to capture not only
changes in da, but also rotational shifts and alterations in the back—
bone in the vicinity of both residues that are in contact. To do so,
we constructed structural parts, comprising sequential neighbors of
the two residues in contact. ResiCon assigns a numerical value to
the geometric variability by using the least root mean square devi—
ation (RMSD) (Kabsch, 1976). Before elaborating on the details, we
proceed with the following definitions.

Elements

An element is a structural part of a protein centered around a given
residue. It comprises five points, corresponding to the positions of
the C, atoms of the central residue, and its four sequential neighbors
(two preceding and two following). For each model 5 in an ensem-
ble, and each residue i, an element—denoted by Ef—is constructed.
Residues for which an element cannot be built (e.g. N— and C—
termini) are omitted.

Geometrical variability

We consider pairs of elements, Eff- ::   and express structural
deviation of a contact between two configurations r and s by RMSD
of  and  We use the following function to express the strength
of a contact in terms of the whole ensemble:

G(i,j) :2 max

The smaller the geometric variability, the stronger the contact.

Method for identification of dynamic domains, hinges and interfacial regions 27

 

We tested several statistics based on RMSDs of pairs of elements.
This particular definition of G assumes that a strong contact is not
‘broken’ in any pair of models. Conversely, a contact whose struc—
tural stability is breached at least once is assumed to be weak and
not contributing to the stability of a given dynamic domain.

Note that conformational transitions may be rapid or insuffi-
ciently sampled. Therefore, defining geometrical variability in terms
of some averaging statistic (e.g. mean, median) might lead to omit—
ting significant structural changes occurring in a protein.

3.2 Contact matrix

We now describe a matrix representation of an edge—weighted
graph, in which nodes correspond to residues. Because we used a
spectral clustering algorithm which required that weights in the
graph were in the interval [0,1], we needed to renormalize the geo—
metrical variability. We calculated the weight between nodes i and j
using the following contact function:

1 |i — j| g 1
D(i, j) :2 La7g(G(i,  residues iandj are in contact
0

otherwise

where Low:
La.r(x) == (1 + ext)“

is a logistic function. We refer to matrix [D(i,j)]il- as the contact
matrix.

Parameters ﬂ > 0 and or > 0 allow for the customization of
ResiCon. The logistic function, Low, can be thought of as a rescaling
transformation for the measure of geometrical variability, G. It has
a simple interpretation—values of G exceeding or are smoothly cut—
off, where the degree of ‘smoothness’ is determined by ﬂ. All results
presented in this article were acquired with default values of or and ﬂ:

1
ﬁdefault -— m

“default 1: MG) (2)
where the 0' and it stand for standard deviation and mean taken over
values of G for all pairs of elements.

Another feature of the logistic function becomes apparent if we
consider an ensemble composed of (nearly) identical structures. This
has two possible interpretations: the protein is very stable and no
conformational changes exist, or that the provided ensemble does
not represent such changes. Thus, ResiCon will assume that the con—
tacts are strong—nearly as strong as the peptide bonds
(G % 0 :> Lay; % 1). Consequently, the contact matrix becomes a
so—called contact map, assigning binary values to pairs of residues
(i.e. 1 if a contact occurred at least once, and 0 otherwise).

3.3 Clustering

The contact matrix may be treated as a similarity matrix, denoted
W, and be used as input in a clustering procedure. Thus, we consider
residues to be similar if they are likely to belong to the same dy—
namic domain. The identified clusters would then correspond to
quasi—rigid structural parts.

The choice of a clustering algorithm is not a trivial task and for
the identification of dynamic domains two crucial requirements
need to be met. First, contact matrices for various proteins vary in
dimension and density and the clustering algorithm needs to per—
form well regardless of these variabilities. Second, the algorithm
should facilitate an automated method of choosing the optimal
number of clusters.

Agglomerative hierarchical clustering algorithms are one of the
most popular approaches to clustering (Han et al., 2006). They fol—
low a greedy scheme to construct a dendrogram encoding distances
between clusters. This dendrogram can be cut at a certain height,
which determines the number of clusters. If the height parameter
could be set so that for all similarity matrices we would obtain high-
quality clusters, the hierarchical clustering would have been a good
candidate for a clustering procedure. However, as we explain in the
Supplementary Materials, estimation of this parameter is difficult,
and to determine the number of clusters we would need to extend
the conventional hierarchical clustering with a measure of cluster
quality.

This was one of the reasons we have chosen a spectral clustering
algorithm, which has an inherent indicator of a partitioning’s
quality.

Spectral clustering

Clustering algorithms based on finding the eigensystem of the simi-
larity matrix (or more often a matrix derived from it) are termed
spectral algorithms. They perform a clustering by minimizing the
cost of cutting a graph into subgraphs, which agrees with our intu—
ition about finding quasi—rigid parts based on a contact matrix.
Optimal clustering is achieved by discarding contacts with the low—
est total weight (as few and as weak as possible) to achieve a parti—
tioning into unconnected regions.

In the case of the clustering algorithm used in ResiCon optimal
partitioning is decoded from eigenvectors corresponding to the
largest eigenvalues of a stochastic matrix D‘1W, where D 2:
diag(d(1), . . .,d(n)) and d(i) :2 Z7217i7é1- w(i,j) (see Weber et al.,
2004). This transformation of the similarity matrix ensures that
the identified clusters tend to have similar sizes, which prevents
from identifying singular nodes as clusters. Spectral algorithms
make no assumptions on the shape of clusters, and, in contrast to
the greedy procedures, are insensitive to the ordering of vertices.

In Figure 2, we present a 150 x 150 similarity matrix with rows
and columns ordered in two different ways. The ordering on the
right is dictated by the spectral clustering—elements 1—50 were as—
signed to the first cluster, 51—90 to the second and 91—150 to the
third. To find these three clusters we use the first three eigenvectors
(corresponding to three largest eigenvalues) of the stochastic matrix
D‘1W. The first eigenvector always has a constant value in all pos—
itions and corresponds to a trivial clustering into a single group. The
second eigenvector encodes a partitioning into two groups: nodes
51—90 in the first, and the remaining nodes in the second group. The
third eigenvector allows to discern the third cluster, composed of
nodes 1—50.

Clustering algorithm

We used a spectral clustering algorithm in which partitioning of a
graph is expressed in terms of a membership matrix X. A short de—
scription of the procedure is presented below, for details refer to
Weber et al. (2004).

Let Y denote the matrix containing la eigenvectors of the D‘1 W
stochastic matrix, corresponding to la largest eigenvalues. The pro—
cedure computes a linear mapping A from the eigenvectors Y to the
membership matrix:

AY=X

The element X,,- of this matrix represents the membership of the ith
node in the jth cluster. Therefore, if n is the number of nodes in the
graph and la is the number of clusters, then X E Rm‘k.

This algorithm has two important features:

° it computes the membership matrix X which allows for overlap—
ping clusters and

° it offers an indicator, called Xmin, used to determine the optimal
number of clusters.

Number of clusters

ResiCon first checks if la : 1. To do so, a partitioning into two clus—
ters is carried out. The spectral algorithm presented above finds an
optimal cut (Weber et al., 2004) leading to clusters A and B (two
sets of indices, that correspond to nodes). We express the cost of
such cut by:

22W

ieA jeB

f: (2 Wax: We),

k,leA k,leB

where w,,- is the weight of the edge between nodes i and j. The val—
idity of a clustering into clusters A and B was checked by asserting
that its cost is less than a given threshold. If the criterion was
met, we assumed that a clustering into two or more clusters
existed. Default threshold for f used to produce all results pre—
sented in this study was 0.1. Above this value we observed that
compact static proteins were partitioned into short (less than four
residues long) segments, which we regarded as improper dynamic
domains. On the other hand, lower values resulted in a single dy—
namic domain assignment in several cases where two domains
were apparent.

If la > 1, the optimal number of clusters is determined with the
use of the indicator presented in Weber et al. (2004). Here, we give
a short overview of the properties of Xmin and propose a simple pro—
cedure for computing the optimal number of clusters. The indicator
XminUe) is defined as the minimal element of the membership matrix
X found by partitioning it into la clusters.

In the case of la : 2 the indicator is always zero, Xmin(2) : 0. For
la > 2 the indicator is less than zero, however if Xmin(le) % 0, the clus—
tering into la clusters is the optimal one (Fig. 3). Let us recall the no—
tion of visualizing a clustering by a block-like similarity matrix.
Roughly speaking, the value of Xmin(le) resembles the deviation
of the similarity matrix from the ‘pure’ block—like form. However, it
is difficult to decide which values of Xmin are sufficiently close to
zero to indicate the optimal number of clusters. Therefore, the prob—
lem at hand is: does the optimal number of clusters equal two, or
more?

In our first approach, the optimal number of clusters was chosen
based on a threshold—the optimal la was the one for which Xmin was

Fig. 3. Values of the Xmin indicator for k = 2,. . ., 10, computed for HIV-1 prote-
ase. Because Xmin(4) is closer to 0 than Xmin(6), the optimal number of clusters
is 4

above a certain value. However, it was difficult to find the right
threshold because values of Xmin strongly depend on the number of
nodes in the graph. Therefore, the following procedure was adapted
in ResiCon:

1. Determine the cost of the optimal cut. If it exceeds the 0.1
threshold, the optimal number of clusters is la : 1. Otherwise, as—
sume that la > 1 and continue the procedure.

2. Compute the values of Xmin for partitionings into 3, 4, . . . ,M
clusters.

3. Find [21 > 2 for which Xmin is closest to 0, and 122 > 2 for which

Xmin is the second closest to 0.

4. If Xmin(le1) > 0.5Xmin(le2), then the number of clusters is la 2121.
Otherwise, la : 2.

The 0.5 constant in the fourth point means that we choose [21 as the
number of clusters, if Xmin(le1) is closer to 0 then to the next best
Xmin (i.e. Xmin(le2)). The maximal number of clusters M is set to 10
by default, but the user can specify a different number. All results
presented in this article were computed with M = 10.

In other words, ResiCon chooses la > 2 for which the indicator
Xmin is ‘relatively close’ to 0. When no such value exists, a partition—

ing into two clusters is assumed to be optimal.

3.4 Hinges and interfacial regions

Hinges

We define hinges as parts of the structure satisfying both of the fol—
lowing conditions:

1. they do not belong conclusively (in terms of membership as ex-
plained below) to any dynamic domain and
2. they are sequentially located between dynamic domains.

The first condition is tested in terms of membership: if a residue
membership in any cluster does not exceed certain threshold Xhinge it
may belong to a hinge. The default value of the parameter is 0.65,
but the user can specify a different value.

Interfacial regions
A residue is assumed to compose an interfacial region if two condi-
tions are met:

1. it does not belong to any hinge and
2. it was in contact with a residue that does not belong to the same
dynamic domain at least once.

3.5 Results comparison
According to our knowledge, no expert curated database of dynamic
domains exists. Also, we are not aware of any quality measure for

Method for identification of dynamic domains, hinges and interfacial regions 29

 

the dynamic domains assignment. Therefore, we compared different
methods by analyzing agreement between their results.

We used the measure presented in Meila (2007) called Variation of
Information (VI) to analyze the results compatibility. It has the advan—
tage of being a metric in the space of all partitionings of a given data—
set. The downside of VI is that its values do not lie in a fixed interval
(e.g. [0, 1]), but instead have an upper bound that depends on the size
of data. In our case data size equals the number of residues in a given
protein. This means that values of VI for partitionings of one protein
are not directly comparable to the values acquired for partitionings of
another protein, with a different number of residues. Nonetheless,
when considering a particular protein, the VI metric quantifies the
agreement between different assignments of dynamic domains. Here
we give an outline of the method, for details see Meila (2007).

Let us denote a clustering by C. It is composed of clusters—
mutually disjoint subsets C1, . . . , Ck. That is, C = {C1, . . . , Ck} such
that C,- D C,- = 0 for all pairs i, 1'. Assume that the numbers of points
in consecutive clusters are n1, . . . ,nk. Then, the probability that a
random point from the dataset belongs to the ith cluster is

. 711'
P(z) :: E,
where n is the number of all points in the set. Note that 2:1 n,- = n.
Analogously, let another clustering of the same set of points
C’ = {C1, . . . , Ciel} be composed of clusters with n’1,...,n;€, points.
By nii/ we will denote the number of points assigned to cluster i in
clustering C and cluster 1" in C’. Then,

Pp, j’) z: 

is the probability of randomly choosing a point that belongs to both
clusters.

The VI measure is defined in terms of entropy and joint entropy
of the probability distributions defined above. That is, if the entropy
of clustering C is expressed by:

k
ma 1: —Z 13(010321’0):
i=1
and the joint entropy of two clusterings is given by
kl

Z P(i7j/)10g2p(i7ji)a

r=1

H(C, C’) := —

k
:1

then the variation of information of the two clusterings is defined as

VI(C, c’) :2 2H(C, c’) — H(C) — H(C’)

3.6 Quality of dynamic domains

We consider dynamic domains to be structural parts of the protein,
which move with respect to each other, but remain internally rigid.
In order to assess which method for dynamic domains identification
is better, a measure was required that would quantify the quality of
a given assignment. We did not find such a scoring function in the
literature, and propose the following geometrical measure called
total geometrical variability:

k
9:: max )RMSD(D§,Df-),

1._1 pairs of states (r,s

where Df- is the set of C, atoms comprising the domain D,- in the
state s, and la is the number of domains. Smaller values of Q indicate
higher quality.

Note that typically, if a domain is structurally rigid, the maximal
RMSD for that domain is smaller than the sum of maximal RMSDs
of its two subsets. Therefore, the proposed measure favors large, com—
pact domains. It is also worth noting that for a trivial dynamic do-
main (single residue) the RMSD is undefined. We set its value to 0,
although this artificially reduces Q (see section ‘Quality analysis’).

4 Results and discussion

We compared ResiCon with two recent methods: GeoStaS
(Romanowska et al., 2012) and PiSQRD (Potestio et al., 2009). The
latter method represents the class of methods which identify dy—
namic domains by analyzing a single structure. We used a test set
comprising 30 NMR—resolved protein structures exhibiting signifi-
cant mobility, which was previously used in Snyder and Montelione
(2005), Kirchner and Guntert (2011) and Romanowska et al.
(2012). The set was initially proposed to examine the efficacy of a
method of identifying structurally stable cores in flexible proteins.
These structures often contain a single rigid core with significant
geometrical distortions present in peripheral regions (as indicated in
Snyder and Montelione, 2005 and also observable in ResiCon’s
results).

We have also used ResiCon to analyze a canonical test case—the
HIV—1 protease molecule—using an MD trajectory computed with a
coarse—grained force field RedMD (Gorecki et al. 2007, 2009) as
input data. This example shows that ResiCon is capable of finding
dynamic domains of a protein whose functionality depends on flexi-
bility and mobility of its rigid parts.

We also explain the so—called zebra effect—a peculiar result pro-
duced by ResiCon, observed in several cases. This effect is especially
strong when a suboptimal number of clusters is chosen.

4.1 Comparative analysis

ResiCon and GeoStaS are both designed to work on an ensemble of
structures, and produce a single partitioning into dynamic domains.
Both methods impose no assumptions about sampling and order of
provided conformations. ResiCon uses maximal local distortions
computed over all pairs of frames, indifferent to over— or undersam—
pling of configurations, as long as they are present in the ensemble.

However, the PiSQRD server by default analyzes a single struc—
ture and estimates the so—called low-energy modes, which are the
eigenvectors of the structural covariance matrix (under the canon—
ical ensemble, i.e. assuming Boltzmann distribution of configur-
ations). These low—energy modes are assumed to carry the
information relevant to dynamic domains identification. We
observed that the choice of an input structure influences the results
significantly, but there is no definite criterion for choosing the right
structure for the analysis. The PiSQRD server provided with a PDB
file containing NMR models by default finds dynamic domains for
the first model. This might introduce a bias unfavorable for
PiSQRD’s performance. We, therefore, decided to examine results
produced by PiSQRD for every structure in the ensemble in order to
compare ResiCon against its full capacity. The best dynamic do—
mains were chosen and presented together with the results produced
by ResiCon and GeoStaS in Table 1.

PiSQRD also gives a possibility of providing a set of low—energy
modes extracted from a structural covariance matrix estimated from
a set of structures, but this procedure is not straightforward and re—
quires additional assumptions (see Supplementary Materials). We
scrutinize the quality of dynamic domains found by PiSQRD from
user—provided low—energy modes in the section ‘Quality analysis’.

(denoted by P1 and P2) for an exemplary 1d1d protein,
and how they relate to the results given by ResiCon (R) and GeoStaS

produced by ResiCon, while P1 gives a sliced—and—diced picture of
the protein’s mobility. It seems that a partitioning produced by
PiSQRD depends on physical properties embedded in a particular
configuration. Although NMR models carrying information about

The ordering of the results is the same as in Figure 5, i.e. best-scoring results are ﬁrst.

Nearly 50% of the assignments produced by PiSQRD for 1d1d
are coherent with the clustering given by ResiCon (see
Supplementary Materials). On the other hand, the result given by
GeoStaS differs from all results produced by PiSQRD. In fact,
ResiCon and PiSQRD are more coherent than GeoStaS and
PiSQRD, which can be expressed by the mean of VI. However, it
would be naive to use the mean value as an indicator of self—
consistency of PiSQRD. Among partitionings produced by PiSQRD,
N (N — 1) / 2 agreements were calculated (where N is the number of
models of 1d1d), whereas the comparison of ResiCon or GeoStaS
with PiSQRD gave N values of VI. Consequently, the average value
of VI between PiSQRD clusterings is not directly comparable with
the average value of VI, e.g. for ResiCon versus PiSQRD.

Therefore, to give a better picture of the divergence of results we
exploit the fact that VI is a metric in the space of all clusterings. For
a given partitioning we computed the radius of a ball centered at
that partitioning, encompassing a certain fraction of the results. In
Table 2 we provide values of radii of balls which encompass 25 , 50
and 75 % of the results. In the case of PiSQRD, we constructed balls
(for a given percentage of results) centered at each partitioning, and
computed the mean values of their radii. The mean of radii does not
carry the bias mentioned earlier. In addition, histograms of VI for
each protein can be found in Supplementary Materials.

4.2 Quality analysis

The box-and-whisker plot in Figure 5 provides a concise picture of
quality scores Q (see Section ‘Methods’) of the dynamic domains as—
signments. It clearly shows that beyond a few exceptions ResiCon
gives the best results. There are seven notable exceptions: 4a5v,
2ktf, 3egf, ladr, lbf8,and 2kr6.

The single dynamic domains found by PiSQRD (blue in Fig. 5)
were produced using low—energy modes, computed as eigenvectors of
a structural covariance matrix estimated by superimposing all models
in an ensemble on a representative structure. In the Supplementary
Materials, we explain how this representative structure is chosen, and
show qualities of dynamic domains found by PiSQRD using different
methods of estimating the structural covariance matrix. It should be
emphasized, however, that these dynamic domains strongly depend
on the method of estimating the structural covariance matrix, which
is not part of PiSQRD’s functionality. Therefore, these results should
only be treated as an additional insight into what the user can expect
from a more complex analysis of NMR structures.

In the case of ladr GeoStaS gave partitionings with lower Q, by
introducing a trivial domain (cutting off C— and N—termini—see
Supplementary Materials). On the other hand, for 4a5v GeoStaS
identified a single domain, which gave a lower value of Q than any
other partitioning.

mined from structural covariance matrices (see Supplementary Materials)

For proteins 2ktf , 3egf and 2htg, PiSQRD produced results
with lower Q than ResiCon, by finding numerous small quasi-rigid
fragments. However, for 2ktf > 25% of assignments found by
PiSQRD contained a trivial, single—residue domain (indicated in red,
with an asterisk). Although our measure does not penalize for this,
we consider such behavior undesirable. Also, note that proteins
3egf and 2htg comprise 53 and 27 residues accordingly. It seems
that in case of small proteins ResiCon often identifies a single do—
main, which does not necessarily result in the lowest Q.

The 2kr6 protein is an interesting example. It contains a ﬂexible
linker composed of >30 residues. As a consequence, partitionings
with high values of Q are observed. Only PiSQRD was able to pro—
duce lower values of Q, by cutting the linker into many shorter parts.
The example of the 2kr6 protein shows that ResiCon does not con—
sider unstructured regions to be separate dynamic domains. Instead,
residues constituting linkers and lacking long—distance contacts are as—
signed to dynamic domains which are closest in sequence.

4.3 Comments

Although PiSQRD’s capability of analyzing a single structure may be
considered an advantage, results presented in Table 2 and Figure 5
show that there is a large discrepancy for different configurations of
the same protein. Nevertheless, based on the histograms of VI
presented in Supplementary Materials and the values of radii in Table
2, we conclude that in most cases results given by ResiCon and
PiSQRD are mutually more coherent, than GeoStaS and PiSQRD
(e.g. lcfc, lqo6, 1vvd, lvve, lyug, 2k3c).Notable exceptions
are: 2rgf , 2pas, 3mef and lzo'la. For these proteins ResiCon did
not find any significant structural transitions and achieved the lowest
value of Q (see Fig. 5) by assigning a single domain.

Dynamic domains found by ResiCon are generally larger
(particularly: 2k3c, 1d1d, 2k0e and 2kr6). Conversely, GeoStaS
often allocates flexible N— and C—terminal parts (e . g . ladr,
lqo6 , 1vve, 3egf) as quasi—rigid parts. The size of dynamic do—
mains is also the main difference between ResiCon and PiSQRD. In
case of small, static proteins (such as 1aey, 1pkt , lpit , Zsz ,
2ait, 3egf and lzo'la), PiSQRD identifies numerous small and

often trivial dynamic domains. ResiCon on the other hand detects
no significant conformational changes (by analyzing an ensemble),
and assigns a single dynamic domain. We observe that in many cases
ResiCon identified a single domain which had the lowest value of Q
among all partitionings (see 2rgf, 2pas, 1aey, 1pkt, lpit,
2vil, laiw, 3mef, Zsz, lleb, 2ait, 2pni, 2114). In these
cases ResiCon correctly detected that no significant transitions were
present in the protein. Therefore, unlike PiSQRD and GeoStaS,
ResiCon can reliably indicate whether conformational changes
occur in an ensemble of structures.

It is also noteworthy that ResiCon does not employ any post—
processing procedures. This keeps the algorithm simple and clean,
but results in a discontinuity of certain partitionings (see 4a5v,
lbf 8 and 1vvd), which we refer to as the zebra effect. Although
this seems to be an artifact of the clustering algorithm, we will take
a closer look at this effect and show that it may also carry valuable
information referring to the protein’s dynamics.

4.4 HIV—1 protease

An analysis of an MD trajectory of the HIV—1 protease showcases
ResiCon’s capabilities. This protein undergoes substantial conform—
ational changes associated with opening/closing of its structural parts,
so—called flaps (Hamelberg and McCammon, 2005). A database of X—
ray—resolved structures, representing configurations which the prote—
ase can attain, is available (Vondrasek and Wlodawer, 2002).

We examined a set of configurations of the HIV—1 protease
acquired from a simulation carried out using the RedMD package
(Gorecki et al., 2009). This coarse—grained force field was designed
to simulate intramolecular motions in proteins and nucleic acids. It
has correctly predicted the flap—opening motion in the HIV-1 prote-
ase, which is known biological fact (Hamelberg and McCammon,
2005), and was independently confirmed by an all—atom MD simu-
lation (Sadiq and De Fabritiis, 2010). Roughly, ~1% of the trajec—
tory seems to exhibit significant conformational transitions (flap
opening events). This is a typical scenario in MD simulations,
where a transition between meta—stable states is swift and fairly
short. We needed a set of representative structures in order to find

and PiSQRD. Structures are colored according to the dynamic domains de-

dynamic domains using ResiCon. From the whole trajectory, we ex—
tracted a set of 200 configurations using a generic procedure based
on the Principal Component Analysis, implemented in the R pro-
gramming language (in the bio3o'l package—Grant et al., 2006)—
see Supplementary Materials.

Values of Xmin for different numbers of clusters are given in
Figure 3. The optimal number of clusters according to our procedure
is 4. Figure 6 depicts the dynamic domains found by ResiCon and
two representative configurations of the protease, as well as re—
sults from GeoStaS and PiSQRD. Because the sample of configur—
ations was drawn according to the Boltzmann distribution, we
were able to straightforwardly estimate the structural covariance
matrix and provide PiSQRD with well—founded low—energy
modes, and acquire a high—quality partitioning into two domains.
Results produced by GeoStaS were acquired from the whole tra—
jectory of the protease.

Dynamic domains identified by ResiCon have the highest value
of the Q measure. Note that ResiCon does not try to minimize Q,
but to produce a clustering with the optimal value of the Xmin indica-
tor. Consequently, at the cost of a slightly higher Q (ca. 1 A) we ar-
rive at a partitioning which corresponds to the biologically relevant
sub—division of the protein. It is also worth mentioning that
ResiCon’s partitioning into 12:2 clusters incidentally leads to an
identical assignment as the one produced by PiSQRD.

Motions of the ﬂaps between the closed and open states are cru—
cial in the functionality of the HIV—1 protease. It is also known that
throughout their motion they remain quasi—rigid (Freedberg et al.,
2002). Therefore, using ResiCon, we successfully extracted a simpli—
fied picture of the mobility of HIV—1 protease, which agrees with ex—
perimental knowledge.

Alternative partitioning into six clusters (see Fig. 7) also deserves
interest. Apart from the ﬂaps, additional dynamic domains

 

 

   
  
  
 

Fig. 8. From the analysis carried out by ResiCon one can see that throughout
the trajectory ASN-83 not only remains close to residues in the N-terminal
arm domain but also fills a cavity in that dynamic domain

resembling ‘arms’ carrying the ﬂaps can be observed. Note that con—
versely to the case of the four dynamic domains, the quasi—static re—
gions are similar, but not ideally reﬂective. This indicates that
motions of the two centrally symmetric sub—units of the HIV—1 pro-
tease in the provided trajectory were slightly different.

It can be also seen that domains are discontinuous. Especially,
residues belonging to the N—terminal lobe (yellow) and to the arm
(cyan) are interleaved. In the following section we will analyze this ef-
fect, and show that this partitioning also carries valuable information.

4.5 The zebra effect

Dynamic domains found by ResiCon may include residues that seem
to be pulled out from another quasi—rigid fragment. This is indicated
as discontinuities (stripes) in Figure 7. Let us take a look at an ex—
ample of such an extracted residue and try to understand the source
of this effect. ResiCon assigned the ASN—83 residue to the arm
(gray) dynamic domain (see Fig. 8). However, its sequential neigh—
bors belong to the lobe domain (yellow). The reason of this discon—
tinuity is that, although ASN—83 has peptide bonds with its yellow
neighbors, they are outweighted by contacts with the gray residues
(see Fig. 8). The discontinuity suggests that throughout the trajec—
tory ASN—83 remained docked in the cavity of the arm domain,
while its peptide bonds formed an axis of a hinge.

It seems that the zebra effect is not accidental, and that it can be
used to find residues which act as ‘pivot points’. However, this effect
is volatile and depends on small ﬂuctuations in the input. Residues
are assigned to dynamic domains based on the fuzzy membership
matrix. At certain positions values of membership to different do—
mains may be almost equal, and when discretized cause emergence
of stripes. Therefore, to strengthen the identification of these ‘pivot
point’ residues, a more thorough analysis of the membership matrix
is required.

5 Conclusions

Typically, protein structures are flexible and mobile, and their con—
formational changes may be crucial in facilitating signaling and met-
abolical processes in which they participate. Breaking a structure
into dynamic domains may be compared with discovering gears and
levers connected by cogs and pegs analogous to those found in clas—
sical machines. Such analyses allow us to better understand molecu—
lar mechanisms responsible for biological functions (e.g. Taylor et
al., 2013), facilitate MD simulations in large time-scales with simpli-
fied forcefields (e.g. Sinitskiy et al., 2012), or discover potential
binding sites when designing inhibitors (e.g. Zhang et al., 2009).

We have presented a universal tool for discovering dynamic do—
mains in proteins. ResiCon is capable of analyzing a single structure,
or an NMR ensemble of structures provided in a PDB format. It can
also be applied to the set of independently obtained structures (e.g.
X—ray crystallographic structures obtained under different condi—
tions). In any case, it provides a complete set of results comprising
partitioning of the molecule into dynamic domains with additional
highlighting of residues composing hinges and interfacial regions.
ResiCon also provides an indicator of partitioning quality, and sug—
gests the optimal number of domains.

We tested our method using the reference set of NMR structures.
It is comparable or better than the recently developed GeoStaS and
PiSQRD. Apart from giving more compact dynamic domains, it is
also capable of distinguishing structures composed of a single quasi—
rigid region.

We have made ResiCon available online (http://www.dwor
kowa.imdik.pan.pl/EP/ResiCon). To make the analysis feasible and
limit the number of uploads, queries may be rerun with changed par—
ameters. Also, all queries and results are stored on our server. (These
two features require registration for security reasons.)

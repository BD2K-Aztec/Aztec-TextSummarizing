Abstract

Motivation: The SEABED web server integrates a variety of docking and QSAR techniques in a
user-friendly environment. SEABED goes beyond the basic docking and QSAR web tools and im-
plements extended functionalities like receptor preparation, library editing, flexible ensemble dock-
ing, hybrid docking/QSAR experiments or virtual screening on protein mutants. SEABED is not a
monolithic workflow tool but Software as a Service platform.

Availability and implementation: SEABED is a free web server available at http://www.bsc.es/

 

SEABED. No registration is required.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.

 

1 Introduction

In silico methods such as molecular docking and quantitative-activ-
ity relationship (QSAR) are gaining an increased role in drug discov-
ery (Alvarez, 2004; Bajorath, 2002). QSAR approaches are
predictive models trained to distinguish compounds from molecular
descriptors. Molecular docking tries to recover active ligands by
finding the best possible fitting of compounds to a 3D-binding site.
QSAR is faster and often more robust than docking approaches, but
is limited to suggesting molecules close to those of proven activity.
Docking requires knowledge of the structure of biological target, is
computationally very demanding, and is less robust than QSAR, but
can make suggestions for new drug scaffolds. We are then looking at
two complementary techniques, and it is not a surprise that during
daily practice drug designers are continuously using both
approaches, which is largely facilitated by commercial programs,
and a non-negligible list of open source software and web services
(Coleman et al., 2013; Grosdidier et al. 2011; O’Boyle et al., 2011;
Tetko et al., 2005; Trott and Olson, 2010). SEABED is a web server

that automates different tools for virtual screening. This includes
classical QSAR (with a large variety of machine learning tools) or
molecular docking (with many features for target and ligand-
binding characterization). The server allows a unique integration of
molecular dynamics information in ﬂexible (ensemble) docking
(Carlson, 2002; Chaudhuri et al., 2012; Rueda et al., 2009) enriched
with essential dynamics MD (EDMD) sampling (Carrillo et al.,
2012). It also enables us to combine in a single project docking and
QSAR (following the ideas in Yoon et al., 2005), and to incorporate
genetic variability into the docking process. The modular nature of
SEABED (see Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Data)
allows an easy extension to incorporate additional modules.
Users can automate docking, QSAR, structure-ensemble docking,
hybrid docking/QSAR and docking of protein mutants
(Supplementary Table S1 provides an estimated processing time for
each feature). The server is complemented with other functionalities
to prepare the receptor and the compound libraries. Receptor and
compounds can be uploaded by the user or extracted from public
databases.

2 Methods

2.1 Basic capabilities

SEABED provides a default representative subset of molecules.
Users can use similarity measures to retrieve chemical entities similar
to a lead using Tanimoto score based on Daylight fingerprints and
can derive a series of descriptors for potential binders, such as
Lipinski’s, logP contributions or atomic charges (see Supplementary
Data). Macromolecular receptors can be explored using our quality
control (see Supplementary Table 52). Users can also explore the ti-
tration of a protein for a given pH (Li et al., 2005) to generate realis-
tic electrostatic distributions, to compute and to visualize
interaction potentials determined by means of our cMIP algorithm,
(Gelp’i et al., 2001). SEABED can automatically locate the binding
site of the receptor from holo structures, or predict cavities from apo
forms using FPocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009). Receptor and ligand
preparation, docking and scoring is implemented using Autodock
Vina tools (Trott and Olson 2010). Docking results are shown as a
dynamic table of 2D compounds ranked by docking score. For each
docked ligand, users can explore a 3D view of the atom and amino
acid contributions to the binding energy based on Van der Waalls
and electrostatic potentials (Orozco and Luque, 2000), information
that can be useful for mutation design and for lead optimization.

2.2 Advanced capabilities

To account for receptor flexibility SEABED supports ensemble
docking. The receptor can be either multiple rigid structures taken
from PDB, homology models or snapshots from a MD simulation.
Our server is integrated into INB’s FlexPortal (http://mmb.irbbarce
lona.org/FlexPortall) and links out to MoDEL (Meyer et al., 2010),
MDWeb (Hospital et al., 2012) and FlexServ (Camps et al., 2009)
to access existing trajectories or calculate an ensemble of 3D struc-
tures from MD simulations. The supported formats are PDB,
Charmm, Amber, Gromacs or NAMD, among others (see
Supplementary Table S3). By default, the server processes the dynamic
information on the receptor or receptor-ligand trajectory and selects
up to 10 representative snapshots from a K-means snapshot clustering,
based on all protein/pocket atom RMSd (pocket can be selected
manually by the user, or guessed by SEABED, see Supplementary
Data). Docking results for ensemble docking are presented in a similar
way than those of rigid docking, but the page adds now both the best
and the average scores among the MD ensemble.

SEABED supports QSAR studies using a wide list of 1D and 2D
fingerprints (Supplementary Table S4). The server implements sev-
eral machine learning methods, with some configurable parameters
including Random Forest, Support Vector Machines or Naive
Bayes, among others—see full list in Supplementary Table S5. For
trained models, the ROC curve and Area Under the Curve (AUC)
score is computed with 10-fold cross-validation. Predictive QSAR
models are then stored and can be applied later to other extended
small molecules datasets. It is also possible to scan drug-like Zinc
(15M of compounds).

Hybrid docking/QSAR is run providing the receptor’s 3D struc-
ture to screen a library. First, a docking experiment for a short list of
molecules is run to define one set of ‘actives’ (molecules docked with
good scores) and another set of ‘decoys’ (bad dockings). These two
sets are then used to train machine learning algorithms to derive pre-
dictive QSAR models. As shown by others, this hybrid approach in-
creases performance by some orders of magnitude with respect to
massive docking and shows good prediction rates (Cherkasov et al.,
2006; Fukunishi et al., 2008, Goﬁi et al., in preparation; Yoon et al.,
2005)

SEABED can automatically search for known annotated protein
mutants as those deposited in the 1000 Genomes database (McVean
et al., 2012). Non-synonymous SNPs are flagged on the protein’s
3D structure. The predicted pathological nature of the mutation is
determined using PMUT (Ferrer-Costa et al., 2005). The server
allows the user to obtain 3D models of the mutants by running
PELE refinements (Borrelli et al., 2005; Madadkar-Sobhani and
Guallar, 2013).

2.3 How to use SEABED

SEABED provides a virtual workspace to scan for active compounds
of a given target. This section describes how to test the prediction
capability of SEABED on MAP kinase (MK14) p38 alpha (see full
details in Supplementary Data and SEABED online Tutorial/Getting
Started sections). MK14 is a protein involved on a wide variety of
cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, transcription
regulation and development. Figure 1 shows the basic schema of
SEABED basic protocol to run a rigid docking, an ensemble docking
and a docking on known mutants of MK14.

On SEABED’s landing page, user needs to create and name a
‘New project’ (see details at http://www.bsc.es/SEABED/static/
NewProject.html). For a rigid docking, user needs to first upload the
target structure, upload a set of small molecules and select a binding
site before launching the docking (see Fig. 1a—d) and full description
at http://www.bsc.es/SEABED/static/RigidDocking.html). For this
example we select 1A9U (one of the structures of MK14) from
‘Upload PDB/traj’. SEABED pre-loads a set of drug-like compounds
on every project by default, but for this example we will upload
(through ‘Upload SDF’ button) a set of known active/decoy com-
pounds in SDF format that can be downloaded from DUD-E data-
base (Mysinger et al., 2012). Then, we will run ‘New Docking’ and
choose to automatically predict binding site region and run all dock-
ings in background. Registered users (registration is optional) will
be notified by email once the job is completed. Docking results
(Fig. 1f) are available in a table format and can be downloaded as
an SDF file. Results can be filtered by ranking score and re-loaded as

Fig. 1. Workflows available to SEABED. For rigid docking, users (a) upload a
protein structure, (b) upload a set of small molecules, (0) select or predict
binding site, (d) launch docking and (f) get small molecules ranked by docking
score. A sub set of this list can be saved and stored in the workspace for other
experiments. For MD ensemble docking the workflow is similar but users
need to (g) upload a MD trajectory instead of a rigid PDB structure and then
(h) choose a set of snapshots before (i) launch and (j) get docking results. For
mutants, users need to first (k) model protein variant and then (I) launch dock-
ing and (m) get results

a new subset on the workspace. The expected results (AUC and
ROC curves) of this test are available on Supplementary Data.

Ensemble docking adds a few steps to the workﬂow, as the user
needs to upload a MD trajectory and choose a number of represen-
tative snapshots to be used in docking (Fig. 1g—i and full description
at (http://www.bsc.es/SEABED/static/EnsembleDocking.html). To
run Ensemble docking, select ‘New Docking’ from the bottom menu
and select ‘Molecular Dynamics’ on the Select target panel.
SEABED will expect two files: topology (Reference file) and coord-
inates (Trajectory file). Then we will choose the number of represen-
tative snapshots (up to 10) based on K-means clustering and RMSd
score of atoms from pocket. The expected results (Fig. 1j) are also
available on Supplementary Data. As reported in a previous work
(Chaudhuri et al., 2012) for 1A9U, MD ensemble can significantly
improve AUC score, from 0.64 for rigid docking to 0.75 for ensem-
ble docking.

The last workﬂow of this example explains how to use SEABED
to run docking on known mutants of this protein. Users will need to
search and model mutants by following the workflow steps on
Figure 1k—m. A full description is available at http://www.bsc.es/
SEABED/static/MutantDocking.html). SEABED is able to identify
two mutants from MK14 found in 1000 Genomes database (P6A
and D343G). From the ‘Structures’ panel go to 1a9u and select
‘Info’. Then select ‘Mutation Information’ from the drop down
menu. Then select ‘Model the mutation’ and the two new structures
will be available on the ‘Structures’ main panel. Then run a rigid
docking workﬂow. Docking these mutants using the same dataset
(see expected results on Supplementary Data) we do not see big dif-
ferences compared with the wild type. Thus, the performance of the
mutants does not differ significantly. For a more detailed description
of this example see Supplementary Data and SEABED online
Tutorial and Getting Started sections.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Much is now known about the mechanistic details of
gene translation. There are also rapid advances in high-throughput
technologies to determine quantitative aspects of the system.
As a consequence-realistic and system-wide simulation models of
translation are now feasible. Such models are also needed as devices
to integrate a large volume of highly fragmented data known about
translation.

Software: In this application note, we present a novel, highly
efficient software tool to model translation. The tool represents
the main aspects of translation. Features include a representation
of exhaustible tRNA pools, ribosome—ribosome interactions and
differential initiation rates for different mRNA species. The tool is
written in Java, and is hence portable and can be parameterized
for any organism.

Availability: The model can be obtained from the authors or directly
downloaded from the authors’ home-page (http://goo.gl/JUWvl).

1 INTRODUCTION

Progress in biotechnological methods means that we now have a
very good working knowledge of the biological components that
are essential for gene translation. Moreover, rapid improvement
of quantitative methods in high-throughput biology enables us to
obtain kinetic rate constants and other parameters of the system.
To date there are no available tools that allow the user to
develop a quantitative system-wide understanding of translation
from the available data. In this application note, we present a
generic model of translation that can be used precisely for this
purpose. It can be parameterized to describe translation of any
eukaryotic or prokaryotic cell. The model can be used to answer
fundamental questions about the dynamics of translation, including
its limiting factors under various conditions. Moreover, it could also
be of signiﬁcant practical and industrial utility, for example within
bioprocessing to understand how recombinant protein impacts on
the translation of endogenous genes.

Prima facia translation is a driven walk of ribosomes over a
sequence of codons contained on the mRNA. A ribosome can only
progress to the next codon if an aa-tRNA has bound to it and
delivered its amino acid to the growing polypeptide. There are a
number of couplings between system variables. Transcripts interact
with one another Via the competition for aa-tRNA and ribosomes.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Within a polysome, ribosomes may collide with one another
potentially resulting in ‘trafﬁc jams’ that may slow down translation
signiﬁcantly. The relative importance of these interactions is
parameter and hence species dependent.

There have been many previous attempts to model translation.
None of those provides a system-wide and dynamic representation
of the system. The biophysical mechanism of polypeptide elongation
as an 18-step process that has ﬁrst been described by Gromadski
and Rodnina (2004). Zouridis and Hatzimanikatis (2007) have
performed a sensitivity analysis of the variables involved in
the translation process and also modelled translation of a single
transcript. Romano et al. (2009) modelled translation as a
totally asymmetric exclusion process. While they provide analytic
insights speciﬁcally illuminating the effects of ribosome—ribosome
interactions on transcripts, their model assumptions are by necessity
too simpliﬁed to provide a comprehensive insight into the various
factors inﬂuencing translation dynamics. Chu et al. (2011) presented
a stochastic mean-ﬁeld model of translation where the heterogeneity
of the model transcript population is represented by its average
sequence. While this model reproduces overall features of the
translation system well, its mean-ﬁeld assumption leaves out crucial
aspects relating to transcript—transcript competition for ribosomes as
well as translation initiation. Most recently, Reuveni et al. (2011)
presented a model based on a master equation approach. This model
does not represent free ribosomes explicitly, nor does it take into
account competition for aa-tRNA or ribosomes.

2 RESULTS

The tool described here uses a hybrid approach mixing agent—
based techniques with event-driven stochastic simulation algorithms
(Gillespie, 1977). The individual mRN As are explicitly represented
as strings of codons; they also contain an ‘initial binding site’ that
summarizes the 5’-UTR of every transcript. Each transcript can be
occupied by one or more ribosomes. The spatial arrangement of
codons makes it necessary to keep track of the position of individual
ribosomes on the mRNA; consequently, ribosomes are represented
as agents encapsulating information about the particular transcript
they are bound to, the position thereon as well as information about
the tRNA they are interacting with. Individual tRNA molecules on
the other hand are assumed to be perfectly mixed within the cell
compartment and need not be accounted for individually. Therefore,
the model merely tracks the number of amino-acylated, uncharged,
bound and unbound tRNAs. The total numbers of tRNA, mRNA
and ribosomes are assumed to be unchanged over the course of a
simulation run.

A model of translation

 

The simulation is driven by discrete events that are scheduled
using Gillespie’s algorithm. These events are as follows:

(i) Binding of free ribosomes to an initial binding site on a
transcript.
(ii) Binding of ribosomes located on an initial binding site to the
ﬁrst codon (AUG site).
(iii) Binding of near/non-cognate aa-tRNAs to unoccupied bound
ribosomes.
(iV) Unbinding of near/non-cognate tRNAs from a bound
ribosome.
(V) Translocation of ribosomes to the next codon.
(Vi) Aminoacylation of uncharged tRNA.
(Vii) Re—initiation/dissociation of ribosome once the ribosome has
reached the end of the ORF.

In real systems, the rate with which free ribosomes bind to
the 5/ cap of the transcript is partially determined by structural
properties of the 5’-UTR. Furthermore, translation initiation is a
multi- step process that involves the assembly of ribosomal subunits,
scanning of the 5’-UTR (von der Haar and McCarthy, 2002) but
also regulatory interactions at ,u-ORFs. Simulating these processes
within the context of a system-wide model of translation would not
be possible. Moreover, it would not be useful because the relevant
parameters of initiation are poorly known. Hence, for reasons of
parsimony and computational efﬁciency this complex sequence of
events was collapsed into a single initiation step (Event (i)) following
second-order kinetics with a mRNA-type speciﬁc rate constant.
Translation proper starts when the ribosome binds to the ﬁrst AUG
site (Event (ii)). This step follows 0-th order dynamics with a rate
that is ORF speciﬁc.

Movement of a ribosome from one codon to the next requires
an aa-tRNA to bind to the ribosomal binding site, to pass a proof-
reading step and to deliver the amino acid. Gromadski and Rodnina
(2004) described this in detail as an 18-step process. Within the
present model, this is reduced to three essential steps, corresponding
to events (iii) to (V). The model assumes that both cognate and near-
cognate (but not non-cognate) aa-tRNAs bind to the ribosome. Once
an aa-tRNA is bound to a ribosome, it is decided probabilistically
whether or not the tRNA is accepted or rejected. The probabilities
depend on whether the aa-tRNA is cognate or near-cognate. If it
is accepted then an event of type (V) is scheduled. Otherwise the
rejected aa-tRNA unbinds during an event of type (iV) and the
aa-tRNA is returned to the pool. It is generally thought (Fluitt
et al., 2007) that signiﬁcant amounts of time are taken up by
aa-tRNA probing the ribosomal binding site without transferring
the amino acid.

A translocation event (V) results in a de-aminoacylation of the
tRNA at the ribosomal P-site. The unbinding of the spent tRNA is
delayed until the next elongation cycle is completed. Following the
exit of the uncharged tRNA, an aminoacylation event (type (Vi)) is
scheduled using Gillespie’s algorithm assuming ﬁrst-order kinetics
and a ﬁxed rate constant that is equal for all tRNA species (Chu
et al., 2011).

Once a ribosome has ﬁnished translating the mRNA, there are
two possibilities. Either it is returned to the pool of free ribosomes

or it re-binds again at the ﬁrst AUG site to go through another
round of translation. Each re-initiation event is a stochastic event.
In addition, the program allows the user to set a maximum number
of re—initiations per ribosome.

Ribosomes on the mRNA have an excluded volume that can
be set by the user. By default, it is assumed that a ribosome
occupies six codons to either side of its central codon, preventing
other ribosomes to occupy this space. During elongation, and also
initiation a situation may occur where a ribosome attempts to bind
to excluded codons. If this happens, then the ribosome does not
proceed with its movement until the relevant site is freed again.

3 DISCUSSION

The software is written in Java (version 1.6) and runs on any
computer platform that supports a Java Virtual machine. Parameters
are entered Via parameter ﬁles. The user can select the ORFs to be
expressed (using FASTA format) and specify mRN A copy numbers
and ribosome—mRNA afﬁnities for each ORF. During execution, the
program outputs data whenever a ribosome has ﬁnished a translation
round. This output includes the ORF that has just been translated,
the translation time, the length of the ORF and the proportion
of free ribosomes. Upon completion, the program also outputs a
summary ﬁle with comprehensive statistics about each codon and
ORF including translation error, usage rates (for codons and tRNA)
and total translation numbers and polysome sizes for individual
ORFs. The run-time of the model depends on the parameters, the
number of transcripts to be simulated and the number of ribosomes.
Using realistic parameters for Saccharomyces cerevisiae, we found
that 15 000 s of translation can be simulated within 5 days using a
single core of a 2 GHz Intel Xeon processor.

ABSTRACT

Summary: As a common post-translational modification, protein gly-
cosylation plays an important role in many biological processes, and it
is known to be associated with human diseases. Mass spectrometry
(MS)-based glycomic profiling techniques have been developed to
measure the abundances of glycans in complex biological samples
and applied to the discovery of putative glycan biomarkers. To auto-
mate the annotation of glycomic profiles in the liquid chromatography-
MS (LC—MS) data, we present here a user-friendly software tool,
MultiGlycan, implemented in C# on Windows systems. We tested
MultiGlycan by using several glycomic profiling datasets acquired
using LC—MS under different preparations and show that
MultiGlycan executes fast and generates robust and reliable results.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glycosylation is one of the most common post-translational
modiﬁcations of proteins, in which glycans are covalently
linked to the side chain of Asn (i.e. N—linked glycosylations) or
Ser/Thr (i.e. O-linked glycosylations) residues. The alteration of
protein glycosylation is known to be associated with various bio-
logical processes and human diseases. Because of high sensitivity
and throughput, mass spectrometry (MS) is routinely used to
identify and quantify glycans derived from a complex biological
sample. Several studies show that differences in glycomic proﬁles
(in both N-linked and O-linked glycans) are observed between
disease and healthy human individuals (de Leoz et al., 2011).
To automate the application of glycomics to the discovery of
putative glycan biomarkers, several software tools have been de-
veloped to annotate glycans in a mass spectrum by matching the
measured mass-to-charge values (m/z) of glycans to theoretical
values. Cartoonist (Goldberg et al., 2005) can assign glycans
from a list of ~2800 N—glycan candidates (derived from glycan
synthetic pathways) to peaks in a matrix-assisted laser desorption

ionization time-of-ﬂight (MALDI-TOF) spectrum based on their
masses that are calibrated using linear models. GlycoWorkbench
(Ceroni et al., 2008) provides an interface for users to draw
glycan structures that can be subsequently used to match the
peaks in MALDI-TOF spectra. Both Cartoonist and
GlycoWorkbench can incorporate fragment ions from tandem
mass spectra (MS/MS) to achieve higher conﬁdence in glycan
assignment. Recent advancement in glycomic proﬁling tech-
niques incorporate electro-spray ionization (ESI), wherein
native or derivatized glycans are chromatographically separated
using hydrophilic interaction chromatography, reversed-phase
chromatography (Hu and Mechref, 2012) or porous graphitized
carbon column before online ESI—MS analyses. Enhanced ESI
sensitivity is observed with derivatization, such as permethyla—
tion of glycans, which can be efﬁciently separated by reversed-
phase chromatography. GlcheSoft (Maxwell et al., 2012) is a
recently published software tool for annotation of multiple
charged glycan ions in liquid chromatography (LC)—ESI—MS
data. However, GlcheSoft is limited to only one adduct type
and requires previous data processing using deconvolution soft-
ware, Decon2Ls (J aitly et al., 2009). Here, we present a new tool
MultiGlycan that can annotate a user-deﬁned list of glycans
observed in MALDI-TOF or LC—ESI—MS data. For MALDI-
TOF, MultiGlycan works by matching experimental isotopic
envelopes with the theoretical envelopes of glycans. Using a mix-
ture model, MultiGlycan can also account for overlapping
glycan isotopic distributions. MultiGlycan-ESI, which we will
focus on here, links together envelopes using the mass of a spe-
ciﬁed adduct, or multiple (including ammonia, sodium, potas-
sium or other deﬁned by the user) adducts simultaneously,
leading to more conﬁdent glycan annotation.

Users can tackle speciﬁc glycan targets by providing a selected
set of monosaccharide compositions, or conduct a blind search
of glycans without specifying the compositions. The program will
report abundances of annotated glycans based on the total ion
intensities of the glycan carrying various charges and adducts
within consecutive MS scans.

2 METHODS

MultiGlycan supports szML and Thermo Fisher .raw (provided
vendor-speciﬁc Xcalibur software is installed) input ﬁle formats. For
every MS spectrum, after peak detection, MultiGlycan uses the
THRASH algorithm from Decon2LS code to de-isotope isotopic distri-
butions. MultiGlycan contains a built-in glycan list representing N-linked

glycans that are generated by using the synthetic pathways of N—linked
glycans in human (Krambeck and Betenbaugh, 2005). Alternatively, users
can choose to build their own N— or O-linked glycan list in a comma
separated values (CSV) ﬁle. For LC—ESI—MS data, after retrieving the
ions from the input data, MultiGlycan matches these ions with a set of
glycan masses and adducts from a built-in or user-deﬁned list.

In the ﬁnal report, MultiGlycan automatically merges the same glycan
across consecutive MS scans. MultiGlycan also provides an intuitive
quantitation measure. Each output associated with a glycan is the sum-
mation of peaks with and without adducts in the whole-isotope envelope
in the spectrum, and then summed within an elution window. These
results can be directly used in large-scale glycomics studies.

3 RESULTS

MultiGlycan was tested on six LC—MS datasets acquired from
two N—glycan samples, released by using 60U of PNGase F
(Flavobacterium meningosepticum), from ribonuclease B
(RiboB), human serum glycoproteins (HBS) and glycoproteins
from three cancer cell lines, respectively (for details, see in Sup-
plementary Table S1).

A Dionex 3000 Ultimate nano-LC system (Dionex, Sunnyvale,
CA, USA) connected to a Velos LTQ Orbitrap hybrid mass
spectrometer (Thermo Scientiﬁc, San Jose, CA, USA) was used
for permethylated N—glycan analysis in this study. The mass spec-
trometer was operated in data-dependent acquisition mode with
one scan event containing a full-scan MS along with a collision
induced dissociation MS /MS, and another scan event containing
a full-scan MS (m/z from 500 to 2000). In the analysis of native
RiboB, only MS scans were acquired.

The complete list of glycan proﬁling results from MS spectra
within datasets used in this analysis can be found in
Supplementary Tables S2—S4. The program reports high-man-
nose N—glycans for both standard RiboB samples as expected:
four of ﬁve known N—glycans for the permethylated and three of
ﬁve for the native sample were reported (see Supplementary
Tables S2 and S3, respectively). MultiGlycan annotated 79
N—glycans in the HBS sample, and 53 of them matched the
manually annotated ones from an earlier study (Hu and
Mechref, 2012) (Supplementary Table S4). Additionally, 26
N—glycans annotated by MultiGlycan were conﬁrmed by
manual annotation (Supplementary Fig. S1). The addition of

adducts enables more conﬁdent assignment to glycan compos-
itions that otherwise are difﬁcult to assign simply using p.p.m.
mass error. For example, in HBS experiment, an ion at
1090.572 m/z can be matched to two different glycan compos-
itions within 10 ppm, viz., [HexNAc5Hex8deHex2+3H]3+ and
[HexNAcsHex7deHex1NeuAcl+NH4+2H]3+. However, the
presence of isotopic distribution at 1084.893 m/z accounts for
[HexNAcsHex7deHex1NeuAcl+3H]3+ (see the corresponding
MS/ MS spectrum in Supplementary Fig. S2) allowing the correct
assignment of [HexNAc5Hex7deHex1NeuAcl] to this glycan.
Thus, clustering isotopic distributions that are linked by adducts
in this manner enables accurate annotation for glycan proﬁling.

We compared MultiGlycan performance with GlycoReSoft on
the HBS and three other cancer cell line samples. In HBS among
the 45 glycans that GlycoReSoft found, 35 were conﬁrmed
manually that are all contained in the reported 79 glycans by
MultiGlycan (Supplementary Table S5 and Supplementary Fig.
S3). The remaining 10 were not reported in the study conducted
by Hu and Mechref (2012). In three cancer cell line samples,
MultiGlycan also identiﬁed more glycans than GlycoReSoft,
most of which are consistent with manual annotation (Table 1,
also see Supplementary Tables S6—S8 and Supplementary Figs
S4—S6).

MultiGlycan allows users to run the analysis directly on the
raw ﬁle. Moreover, it can handle multiple adducts, and any
speciﬁed glycan list. All these features make MultiGlycan a
robust tool ready for high-throughput glycomic data analysis.

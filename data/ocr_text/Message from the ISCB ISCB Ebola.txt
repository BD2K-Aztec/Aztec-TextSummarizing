ABSTRACT

Speed is of the essence in combating Ebola; thus, computational
approaches should form a significant component of Ebola research.
As for the development of any modern drug, computational biology is
uniquely positioned to contribute through comparative analysis of the
genome sequences of Ebola strains and three-dimensional protein
modeling. Other computational approaches to Ebola may include
large-scale docking studies of Ebola proteins with human proteins
and with small-molecule libraries, computational modeling of the
spread of the virus, computational mining of the Ebola literature and
creation of a curated Ebola database. Taken together, such compu-
tational efforts could significantly accelerate traditional scientific
approaches. In recognition of the need for important and immediate
solutions from the field of computational biology against Ebola, the
International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) announces a
prize for an important computational advance in fighting the Ebola
virus. ISCB will confer the ISCB Fight against Ebola Award, along
with a prize of US$2000, at its July 2016 annual meeting (ISCB
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology 2016, Orlando, FL).

1 INTERNATIONAL SOCIETY FOR
COMPUTATIONAL BIOLOGY

The International Society for Computational Biology (ISCB) is
dedicated to advancing the understanding of living systems
through computation. ISCB now represents more than 3200
computational biologists working in over 70 countries. It organ-
izes more than seven annual international meetings and confers
several major prizes, including the ISCB Accomplishment by a
Senior Scientist Award, the ISCB Overton Prize and the ISCB
Outstanding Contributions Award. With the ISCB Fight against
Ebola Award, the society offers for the ﬁrst time an award for a
speciﬁc scientiﬁc objective, thereby acknowledging the urgency
of action required to ﬁght a rising challenge.

2 EBOLA

The Ebola Virus (EBOV) causes the Ebola Virus disease (EVD), a
disease with high fatality rates that has killed over 6300 individ-
uals from February to December 1, 2014, in the current outbreak
(Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2014). The ﬁrst
reports assessing spreading risk have been published (Gomes
et al., 2014). Recently, 99 EBOV genomes from 78 patients
have been analyzed (Gire et al., 2014). To facilitate global re-
search, the respective author teams made all their data freely
available. This laudable decision aligns with the ISCB open-
access policy (Lathrop et al., 2011a, b). Given the great urgency
of creating an adequate response to Ebola in a short time frame,
we urge funding agencies to develop special grant mechanisms
for Ebola research, such as that which the United States
National Science Foundation has recently announced
(National Science Foundation, 2014). For example, funding
agencies could allow existing grant recipients to redirect funds
from or apply for administrative supplements to appropriate
existing grants for research dedicated to Ebola.

ISCB Fight against Ebola Award ISCB will confer the award,
along with a prize of US$2000, at the ISCB annual meeting,
Intelligent Systems for Molecular Biology, in July 2016,
Orlando, FL.

3 JUDGMENT CRITERIA

The award will be conferred on the submission that most closely
meets the goal of providing an immediate solution from the ﬁeld
of computational biology as assessed according to the following
terms: (i) high impact, (ii) broad access, (iii) measurable out-
comes on understanding, handling, treating or preventing the
disease and (iv) close interaction with established mechanisms
of Ebola control and research.

A selected team comprising experts chosen from areas such as
Ebola research, epidemiology, public health, computational Vir-
ology, structural biology, vaccine development, translational bio-
informatics, genomics and genome analysis will assess all

submissions. We will only consider submissions that remain
within a limit of two pages. Please note that your submission
could be in the style of a journal paper. Be advised of the fol-
lowing constraints when ﬁtting your material onto the two pages:
(i) the typeface must be Arial font throughout, using a minimum
9-pt font size for ﬁgures and a minimum of 10-pt Arial for the
text. The precise minimum page margins depend on your choice
of format (US letter: a minimum of 1.25 inches on top and
bottom and a minimum of 2.5 inches at the sides; A4: a min-
imum of 3 cm on top and bottom and a minimum of 1.5 cm on
both sides). Submissions must be sent through email (a single
PDF document) to Diane Kovats (admin@iscb.org) using the
text ‘ISCB Fight against Ebola Award’ in the subject and body
of the email. The deadline for submission is April 10, 2016 (any
time zone).

Conflict of Interest: none declared.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Human cells are organized into compartments of different
biochemical cellular processes. Having proteins appear at the right
time to the correct locations in the cellular compartments is required
to conduct their functions in normal cells, whereas mislocalization of
proteins can result in pathological diseases, including cancer.
Results: To reveal the cancer-related protein mislocalizations, we
developed an image-based multi-label subcellular location predictor,
iLocator, which covers seven cellular localizations. The iLocator in-
corporates both global and local image descriptors and generates
predictions by using an ensemble multi-label classifier. The algorithm
has the ability to treat both single- and multiple-location proteins. We
first trained and tested iLocator on 3240 normal human tissue images
that have known subcellular location information from the human pro-
tein atlas. The iLocator was then used to generate protein localization
predictions for 3696 protein images from seven cancer tissues that
have no location annotations in the human protein atlas. By comparing
the output data from normal and cancer tissues, we detected eight
potential cancer biomarker proteins that have significant localization
differences with P-value < 0.01.

1 INTRODUCTION

The knowledge of the subcellular/organelle localization of pro-
tein molecules can provide important help for understanding
their functions in cells (Chou and Shen, 2008; Emanuelsson
et al., 2007). In the past decade, a variety of methods have
been developed for predicting the subcellular localizations of
proteins (Nair and Rost, 2009). These methods can be grouped
into two categories: one-dimensional (1D) amino acid sequence-
based and two-dimensional (2D) image-based methods.

The sequence-based methods usually generate protein sub-
cellular location predictions through homology transfer

(Nair and Rost, 2009), target signal search (Emanuelsson
et al., 2007) or statistical machine learning (Chou and Shen,
2008). These methods have been successfully applied to
genome-wide large-scale function annotations, but they are
hard to detect protein translocations, which often cause changes
in the related biological network functions. One reason is that
when the translocation occurs, the primary sequences of the
translocated protein are about the same, which cannot be de-
tected by the sequence-based comparisons. Therefore, the intui-
tive 2D image-based algorithms are explored in this situation
(Peng et al., 2012).

Efforts on the 2D image-based approaches are mainly focused
on three aspects: (i) studies on new representative image descrip-
tors, with examples including the subcellular location features
(SLFs) for protein distributions as proposed by Boland and
Murphy (2001); (ii) studies on improving the accuracy of classi-
fication algorithms, with examples including the classiﬁcation
based on multi-resolution subspaces as reported by Chebira
et al. (2007), and the two discriminative models by Li et al.
(2012b), which extended the logistic regression with structure
latent variables; and (iii) applications of existing predictors to
the data analysis (Li et al., 2012a).

Most of the 2D methods are single-label predictors, i.e. they
assumed that each protein corresponds to only one location.
However, nearly 20% of human proteins co-exist at :2 different
subcellular locations (Zhu et al., 2009). These multi-label pro-
teins often contain signiﬁcant biological information, such as
protein complex transcription in cell cycles. Only few studies
have attempted to predict distribution from human protein
images in multiple-location cases (Peng et al., 2010; Zhao
et al., 2005). These studies tried to use statistics of fluorescence
objects to differentiate location patterns. In these approaches,
protein ﬂuorescence objects in images are detected and clustered
into several types based on their shape, size and position in cells;
then each single-label pattern is represented by a set of objects in
distinct types. Finally, a multi-label image is linearly decomposed
into the object frequencies in each type (Zhao et al., 2005).
Such methods have several limitations: (i) overlapping objects
and filamentous proteins will confuse the object detection algo-
rithm because a continuous region of pixels was deﬁned as an
object; and (ii) prediction accuracy is limited by the simple linear
model. The former limitation may lead to incorrect object

targets, and the latter tends to cause the constructed classiﬁer to
be too sensitive to the noise and overﬁtting.

Instead of the linear statistics, in this study we seek to develop
a more ﬂexible and accurate machine learning predictor, named
iLocator, which can handle multi- and single-label samples
simultaneously. Three factors critical for machine learning algo-
rithm developments, including high-quality benchmark dataset,
highly discriminative image descriptors and accurate multi-label
learning algorithms, will be carefully designed and systemically
examined.

For benchmark training and testing, we will collect the high-
resolution immunohistochemistry (IHC) microscopy images
from the human protein atlas (HPA, http://www.proteinatlas.
org/) (Ponten et al., 2008). The efﬁciency of both global and
local image descriptors will be examined as input to the classi-
ﬁers. The global features contain the Haralick texture features
and the DNA distribution features, which both belong to the
well-deﬁned SLFs (Boland and Murphy, 2001). The local
binary patterns (LBPs) are applied for the ﬁrst time to this
multi-label problem to describe the local details. Moreover, we
will implement an ensemble classiﬁer in iLocator composed of
two multi-label learning modes, i.e., binary relevance (BR)
(Boutell et al., 2004) and classiﬁer chains (CC) (Read et al.,
2009), because both have been reported performing well in
multi-label image pattern recognition.

For normal cell function, it is critical to have the proteins
appear at the right location at the correct time for forming
appropriate interactions with correct molecular partners.
Mislocalization will make the proteins inaccessible, and thereby
not be integrated into the proper functional biological networks
or pathways. Protein function loss caused by the mislocalization
will inevitably affect the whole biological system, which has been
found to be associated with many human diseases (Hung and
Link, 2011). Several potential reasons can result in aberrant pro-
tein locations, such as amino acid mutations in targeting signal
sequence, changes in the post-translational modiﬁcations and
the expression level, and trafﬁcking machinery deregulations.
To fully understand the underlying mechanisms of the protein
mislocalizations, it is important to ﬁrst identify the mislocalized
protein targets. Although studies to look for biomarker proteins
have been previously reported (Murphy, 2004), these studies only
involved single-label classiﬁers, which cannot detect changes
from multiple locations to a single location, from a single loca-
tion to multiple locations or from multiple locations to different
multiple locations. Considering the fact that there are ~20%
human proteins co-localized in more than one location, these
changes can occur frequently. For example, in a healthy cell,
protein cylin D1 can shuttle between the nucleus and cytoplasm.
In contrast, a reduction of cyclin D1 exported from the nucleus
can lead to overexpression of this protein in the nucleus, and the
inactivation of retinoblastoma, which is a tumor-suppressing
protein (Gladden and Diehl, 2005). Other such multiple-location
shuttling proteins associated with cancers include p53, BRCAl,
SOX9 and APC (Bratthauer and Vinh, 2009; Fabbro and
Henderson, 2003). Detecting these changes requires accurate
multi-label predictors. In this study, iLocator has been applied
to screen such potential mislocated biomarkers in our protein
dataset, which includes multi-label proteins. By comparing the
predictions output from iLocator between cancer and normal

tissues, several proteins have been detected as potential cancer
biomarkers.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

The ﬂow chart of the experiment in this study is depicted in Figure 1,
which includes two procedures of iLocator development and the applica-
tion for cancer biomarker detection.

2.1 Preparing dataset

The basic idea of the statistical machine learning is to learn the discrim-
inative rules from training datasets. Hence, the image data quality is of
critical importance for the experiments of this study. For instance, it has
been pointed out that the high quality of antibody staining provides a
more accurate reﬂection of subcellular patterns (Uhlen et al., 2010). Here,
the benchmark dataset is constructed from the HPA database. We
selected high-quality samples based on two indexes: the validation score
and the objective score in HPA (Ponten et al., 2008). Protein labels were
obtained from the HPA and UniProt. We collected proteins from both
the normal image dataset and the cancer image dataset (Supplementary
Table S1).

2.1.] Normal image dataset This dataset was used for training and
testing classiﬁers. It contained 3240 images from 28 proteins in normal
cells, of which seven proteins with two or more organelle labels (in
normal tissues) are considered as multi—label proteins. We considered
seven major organelles: cytoplasm, endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi appar-
atus, lysosome, mitochondria, nucleus and vesicles.

2.1.2 Cancer image dataset The subcellular locations of cancer
images are not annotated in HPA, so the cancer image dataset was to
be predicted and compared with the data from normal cells to detect
mislocalizations. This dataset contained 3696 cancer images of the same
28 proteins as in the normal dataset. Seven cancers were considered in this
study: breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic cancer, prostate cancer, renal
cancer, thyroid cancer and urothelial cancer.

Each IHC image shows a speciﬁc protein in brown and DNA in purple
(Ponten et al., 2008). To avoid artifacts from poorly stained images,
such as those with too much black or cyan dye, we removed images
that had hue values exceeding a threshold of 13 in the hue, saturation
and value color space (Newberg and Murphy, 2008). After this step, 3207

images remained, including 823 multi—label ones. Then, the datasets were
partitioned into 2 folds: 1604 images (include 412 multi-label ones) were
put into the training set, whereas the other 1603 (include 411 multi—label
ones) were put in the testing set.

2.2 Image separation

The original HPA image is the fusion of DNA (purple sections) and
protein (brown sections). Because we mainly need the distribution of
protein, it is important to separate the protein channel from that of the
DNA. We tested two separation techniques, i.e., linear spectral separation
(LIN) and blind spectral separation by non-negative matrix factorization
(NMF), on the benchmark dataset. Both of them separate purple and
brown channels through color transforming (Newberg and Murphy,
2008).

2.3 Feature extraction

After the separation step, we extracted Haralick texture features, DNA
distribution features and LBP features from the separated channels.
Haralick features describe image texture by some intuitive aspects of
image, such as inertia and isotropy (Nanni et al., 2010a). Here, we used
10 Daubechies ﬁlters with vanishing moments from 1—10 (dbl—dblO)
when extracting Haralick features. Each of them can generate an inde-
pendent set of 836 Haralick features. Four DNA distribution features
were used because the nucleus is fairly consistent among cells as a
common point, and may provide reference for determining the protein
localization pattern (Newberg and Murphy, 2008). In this study, LBP is
256-dimensional (See Supplementary Fig. S1 for an example of the LBP
descriptor), which characterizes the spatial structure of local image tex-
ture and can detect micropatterns in the image, such as ﬂat areas, edges
and spots (Nanni et al., 2010a; Tahir et al., 2012).

To reduce computational time and avoid overﬁtting, feature selection
was performed to select the most informative features. We selected fea-
tures using stepwise discriminant analysis (SDA) (Newberg and Murphy,
2008). The output of SDA is a subset of features ranked in terms of their
importance and can be fed into classiﬁers.

2.4 Multi—label classiﬁcation

We trained classiﬁcation models using BR and CC modes, respectively.
According to BR, one binary algorithm is trained for predicting the rele-
vance of one class. The method ‘cross-training’ was used in the training
section (Tsoumakas et al., 2010). Cross-training means that when creating
a label classiﬁer, all the training samples associated with this label are
considered as positive samples, whereas all others are considered as nega-
tive ones. As in BR, CC also trains seven binary classiﬁers corresponding
to seven labels. However, considering labels that are correlated might
indicate multiple possible locations, CC takes the correlation among
labels into account. It extends the attribute space of each classiﬁer with
the 0/ 1 label of all previous classiﬁers, and the seven binary classiﬁers are
linked to form a chain (See Supplementary Fig. S2 for illustrations of BR
and CC learning modes) (Read et al., 2009). Because different label orders
can give slightly different results, we used a random chain order. We
applied support vector machine (SVM) as the classiﬁer, and the
LIBSVM-2.9l-l package was used (http://www.csie.ntu.edu.tw/~lein/
libsvm/).

Each classiﬁer based on BR or CC can output a seven-dimensional
(7D) score vector [5 1, 52, . . . , S7] per testing image, where each score cor-
responds to a speciﬁc class (organelle). The score represents the conﬁ-
dence of belonging to the corresponding class. It is positive if the
corresponding binary classiﬁer predicts the image belongs to the class,
and negative if not. To decide the label set of a sample from its score
vector, we used two criteria, i.e. top criterion and threshold criterion
(Boutell et al., 2004), and obtained intersection elements of their results
to compose the ﬁnal label set. The top criterion considers that the label

set consists of the labels with positive scores, and if all seven scores
are negative, the label with the maximum score is considered as the
unique label. The assumption of threshold criterion is that the score
values corresponding to the real labels are the largest, and, in the case
of multiple labels, have similar scores. Therefore, a threshold T is needed
to judge whether the top scores are close enough. When deciding whether
the label c should be assigned to the predicted label set, we deﬁned H; to
denote yes and H 2 no. And dif was deﬁned as the difference between the
biggest score and the cth one:

dif: 77161960052, ---,S7} — Sc (1)

Then H1, is determined according to magnitude of dif: H1 is true if
difz T, and H 2 is true if djf< T. The objective function is:

b

argmazz: P(H8| dif)
8:1, 2

= argmazz: P(dif| H8) - P(Hs) / P(dif) (2)
821,2

argmazz: P(dif | H 8) - P(H8)
821,2

The probabilities of dif in H1 and H 2 (P(dif|H1) and P(dif|H2)), and
the probabilities of H1 and H 2 (P(H1) and P(H2)), can be calculated from
the training set (Fig. 2A—D). The process of determining T uses maximum
a posteriori (MAP) principle (Fig. 2E). According to Equation (2), T is
at the intersection of P(dif|H1) - P(H1) and P(dif|H2) - P(H2).

Detect mislocated human proteins using iLocator

 

In this study, we evaluated the performance of the classiﬁer by ﬁve
multi-label classiﬁcation metrics: subset accuracy, accuracy, recall, preci-
sion and average label accuracy (See Supplementary text for details).
Among them, subset accuracy is the fraction of samples whose predicted
label set is exactly the same as the true label set. We evaluated the
performance of classiﬁcation mainly by it.

2.5 Identifying potential biomarkers

Protein subcellular mislocations are found to have correlations with
human diseases (Hung and Link, 2011). To reveal the hidden mechan-
isms, it is important to know the protein locations in normal and cancer
conditions, respectively. Because there are no explicit subcellular location
annotation data for proteins in cancer tissues in HPA, we cannot com-
pare these two conditions directly. Therefore, we used the obtained clas-
siﬁers to give predictions of these 28 proteins in normal and cancer
tissues, respectively. The cancer image dataset contains 3696 images,
and involves seven cancers, i.e. breast cancer, lung cancer, pancreatic
cancer, prostate cancer, renal cancer, thyroid cancer and urothelial
cancer (Supplementary Table S1). For each query protein—tissue combin-
ation, suppose there are N normal images and M cancer images. Each
image has a 7D score vector. With these score vectors, we screened bio-
markers by two steps: ﬁrst, screening by the direct comparison method;
second, screening by evaluating the signiﬁcance of location changes using
the t—test. In the ﬁrst step, we calculate an average vector from these N
normal vectors and use it to determine the ﬁnal label set. The label set
corresponding to the cancer state can also be determined with the similar
procedures. The direct comparison method selects these protein—tissue
combinations satisfying the two conditions: (i) the label set of normal
and cancer states are not exactly the same and (ii) sign (+ and —) of the
average predicted scores of these changing locations are opposite between
normal and cancer states. In the second step, for each selected combin-
ation by step 1, an independent sample t—test is conducted on the M and
N score vectors. The detailed process on one example protein—tissue com-
bination can be found as Supplementary Figure S3. For each biomarker
protein—tissue combination, the t—test will output a P—value vector, where
each element represents the conﬁdence of mislocalization in a subcellular
location from normal to the cancer condition. These protein candidates
are considered as reliable potential biomarkers only if the P—values of
their translocations are <0.01.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Creating and validating single classiﬁers

In the initial experience, we tested LIN and NMF, respectively.
The experimental results show that LIN approach outperforms
NMF by 5—10% on the testing dataset (Supplementary Fig. S4).
This is consistent with a previous report (Newberg and
Murphy, 2008). Considering LIN can yield better results and
its faster speed, it was adopted in the following study of creating
iLocator.

To test whether pre—processing of images by enhancing tech-
nique is helpful for improving the classiﬁcation performance in
this study, we compared the contrast limited adaptive histogram
equalization enhancing, and nothing is performed on the current
dataset. The results show that the latter outperforms contrast
limited adaptive histogram equalization by 3—5% in the subset
accuracy and thus was adopted in the following experiments,
which are similar to a previous study (Paci et al., 2013).

Then we calculated various features from the separated DNA
and protein channels without pre—processing, selected image fea-
tures by SDA, and then trained classiﬁcation models using BR

and CC modes, respectively. We tested these classiﬁers on the
testing set. When deciding the label set of a sample from its score
vector, we had to determine the difference threshold T before
using threshold criterion (Fig. 2). Consequently, the subset
accuracies of these single classiﬁers range from 57.89 to
67.12%. The performance of CC is superior to BR because CC
can capture complex correlations, such as proteins co-existing at
different locations due to spatial proximity or functional reasons.

3.2 Effects of discriminative features and classiﬁcation
methods

The SLFs, including DNA features and Haralick features, can
make good sense in predicting protein localizations (Newberg
and Murphy, 2008). In this study, we added the LBP features
to SLF vectors and obtained a 1096 (4 —l— 836 + 256)-dimensional
image descriptor. After feature selection, we obtained the most
informative features that can be fed into classiﬁers. From

is not small in the top ranked features, where it is also interesting
to ﬁnd that the LBPs contribute to the top 1 selection. This
demonstrates that both the LBP features and SLFs have a sig-
niﬁcant role in distinguishing different protein location patterns.

The classiﬁcation results also demonstrate LBPs signiﬁcantly
contribute to the performance improvements (Fig. 3B and C).
For instance, on the db8 model, the subset accuracy improved
from 52.96 to 61.82% by adding LBP in BR, and similarly, a
7.11% improvement was observed in the CC mode (Fig. 3B).
Besides, the results of subset accuracy demonstrate the superior-
ity of CC over BR, indicating CC predicts more samples with all
the labels correctly identiﬁed. It is also interesting that CC is not
always better than BR in some metrics (Fig. 3C). The reason
is that CC has a disadvantage: it may add some irrelevant attri-
butes about other labels, which can make confusion in classiﬁ-
cation. The effect of this disadvantage is obvious on single-label
samples, which can be conﬁrmed in later experience.

Although the overall performance was improved by LBP, it
was not clear how such enhancement happened. To reveal this
point, we separated the testing set into two groups: a single-label
image set and a multi-label image set. We further represented the
two groups with SLFs alone, and with both SLFs and LBP,
respectively. The classiﬁcation results show that the improve-
ments of each evaluating metric in the multi-label testing set
are more salient than in the single-label set when incorporating
LBP (Fig. 4). For example, the increments of subset accuracy in
multi-label set by BR and CC were 11.68 and 14.84%, whereas
in the single-label set, the improvements were 7.89 and 4.45%,
respectively. The disparity indicates that the multi-label samples
beneﬁt more from adding LBP. The reason is that a multi-label
pattern is a mixture of several single-label patterns, and LBPs are
local features representing statistics of binary micropatterns.
Hence, LBP can catch the subtle local features that are important
for multi-label classiﬁcation.

Besides, three more phenomena can be observed from
Figure 4. The ﬁrst is that, in general, multi-label images are
much more difﬁcult for classiﬁcation than the single-label ones.
This is demonstrated by the better performance of single-label
(BR) and single-label (CC) images than multi-label (BR) and

multi-label (CC) images are better than multi-label (BR) ones,
especially subset accuracy, which shows a difference of 15.57%.

multi-label testing dataset classiﬁed using BR and CC modes with db8

This phenomenon indicates that considering correlations among
labels is particularly important for multi-label set prediction.
Finally, we can see the single-label (BR) samples are higher
than single-label (CC) ones, especially when adding LBP. This
phenomenon reveals that CC is not always better than BR on
single-label samples because it may take irrelevant attributes
into account. Considering the latter two phenomena, to get
advantages of BR and CC together, we tended to combine
their models.

3.3 Performance of ensembled classiﬁer

Therefore, considering an ensemble of multiple classiﬁers gener-
ally gives a better performance (Shen and Chou, 2006), we con-
structed an ensembled classiﬁer by combining the BR and CC
classiﬁers on dbl—dblO. Each of these 20 classiﬁers will output a
classiﬁcation vector consisting of seven probabilities of the query
image to the seven covered subcellular locations. We then took
the average of these 20 output vectors to generate the ﬁnal pre-
dictions. This ensembled model is ﬁnally used in iLocator
(Fig. 1A). Its ﬁve evaluation criteria of subset accuracy, accur-
acy, recall, precision and average label accuracy are 72.49, 77.83,
75.45, 80.50 and 92.71%, respectively. As expected, we can see
big improvements in all the metrics compared with any single
simple classiﬁer.

3.4 Identifying cancer biomarkers

In the entire dataset, there are ~3 normal images and ~24 cancer
images for each protein—tissue combination. We screened bio-
markers by the two steps presented before. The ﬁrst step gives
predicted label sets of all the protein—tissue combinations in
normal and cancer conditions, respectively (Fig. 5A and B).
Subcellular location changes in 12 proteins were detected by
direct comparison (Fig. 5C). These 12 proteins constitute an ini-
tial set of potential biomarkers. Then we conducted an independ-
ent sample t—test on their corresponding score vectors to evaluate
the signiﬁcance levels of the localization changes. There are eight
proteins with 18 protein—tissue combinations left after the second
step (Fig. 5D and Table 1).

According to HPA, there are multiple subtypes for some can-
cers like breast cancer, lung cancer and thyroid cancer, so it is
necessary to study the effectiveness of screened biomarkers listed
in Table l for subtype cancers. Thus, we conducted further
experiments for the following subtypes: breast cancer of duct
carcinoma and lobular carcinoma, lung cancer of adenocarcin-
oma and squamous cell carcinoma, thyroid cancer of follicular
adenoma carcinoma and papillary adenocarcinoma. In Table 1,
eight protein—tissue combinations relating to the three cancers
need to be further certiﬁcated. Using the same method as sec-
tion 2.5, we compared the images from each subtype of cancers
with the normal images separately. The ﬁnal results show that
all the tested proteins, except CPT2, have the same altered sub-
cellular locations among all of the cancer subtypes for a given
tissue. However, CPT2 is an exception, where its subcellular
location in the lung squamous cell carcinoma subtype is mito-
chondria, the same as the normal condition. This result indicates
that CPT2 is only a suitable biomarker for lung adenocarcin-
oma (Table l).

and the gray are P—value> 0.01. The eight proteins involving with black lines were considered as reliable potential biomarkers

From the listed detailed P—values of the involved translocation
changes of the eight proteins (Table l), we can make ﬁve inter-
esting observations:

First, biomarker proteins in cancer tissues tend to move
away from other structures and function only in the cyto-
plasm, except for GOLGA5, DBT and CPT2. This is con-
sistent with previous results that a protein’s cytoplasmic
localization can serve as an inactivation mechanism that
gives rise to uncontrolled cell proliferation and the onset
of disease, which was suggested as a general mechanism

for the inactivation of tumor suppressors (Salmena and
Pandolﬁ, 2007).

Second, ﬁve screened biomarkers changed from multiple lo-
cations to only a single location. Among them, translocations
from the cytoplasm and nucleus co-localization to the
cytoplasm alone are most frequent. Capable of shuttling
between cytoplasm and nucleus and performing functions
in nucleus subcellular localization are revealed as important
features for some tumor suppressors (F abbro and Henderson,
2003). Loss of functions in the nucleus of these proteins

Fourth, it also can be seen that if mislocalization occurs, the
changes are the same for one protein in different tissues,
except the protein GOLGA5. GOLGA5 translocates from

can change their roles in the cell cycle and can be fatal (Hu
et al., 2004).

Third, the results also demonstrate that the developed
iLocator can deal with both multi-label and single-label pro-
teins. Of the ﬁnal eight proteins, six involve multiple locations
demonstrating the importance of developing sensitive
multi-label classiﬁers; translocations on protein HIPl and
GOLGA5 also demonstrate that iLocator can still be effect-
ively applied to single-label translocation problems.

the Golgi apparatus to the mitochondrion in thyroid cancer,
and from the Golgi apparatus to the ER in the other ﬁve
cancers. This point, as well as the fact that mislocalization
does not occur in all the considered cancers, demonstrates
that the metabolic process of protein is various in different
tissues. So it is a reasonable way to study the protein subcel-
lular mislocalization in different tissues separately.

Finally, the biomarker protein CPT2 works for lung adeno-
carcinoma but not lung squamous cell carcinoma. This dem-
onstrates that different subtypes of the same cancer might
be driven by different protein translocations. This point is
reasonable when considering that cancer subtypes have vari-
ous pathogenesis.

Some information in the literature can also be found to sup-
port our predicted biomarker results. In the annotations in
UniProt, ACTN4 locates in both the nucleus and cytoplasm in
normal tissues. According to our predicted results, it will locate
only in the cytoplasm when cancer occurs in the lung, prostate or
kidney. This screened result is consistent with the literature,
which found that ACTN4 decreases in the nucleus and locates
exclusively to the cytoplasm in cancerous samples and may serve
as a biomarker (Honda et al., 1998; Jasavala et al., 2007). Our
results also showed that the FHL2 protein is an indicator of
thyroid cancer when it only functions in cytoplasm and loses
its ability to locate to the nucleus (P-value = 0.0037). The litera-
ture supports the ﬁnding that cytoplasmic FHL2 is involved in
cancer invasion (Kahl et al., 2006; Konig et al., 2010). Besides, it
is also detected that the protein GOLGA5 can translocate
from the Golgi apparatus to the mitochondrion in thyroid
cancer. This is consistent with the literature specifying that the
translocations involving GOLGA5 have been found in thyroid
tumors (Corvi et al., 2000; Klugbauer, et al., 1998). All these
supporting ﬁndings conﬁrm the effectiveness of our system.

4 DISCUSSION

We have built an IHC image-based multi-label human protein
subcellular location predictor iLocator and presented a frame-
work to screen cancer biomarkers. The iLocator is an efﬁcient
bioimage—based predictor that can handle both single- and mul-
tiple-location site proteins simultaneously. By applying iLocator
to the datasets from both normal and cancer tissues, eight pro-
teins were identiﬁed as cancer biomarkers. We showed that those
proteins that can shuttle between multiple subcellular locations
are important for normal cell functions, and losing one of the
locations may cause disease. These identiﬁed mislocated disease-
causing protein targets have also opened a new avenue for the
therapeutic treatment of some human diseases. For example, by
relocating these mislocated proteins to the correct subcellular
localizations, they can restore their correct functions, which are
helpful to cure the diseases. Although these techniques are still in
the infancy stage, they have a promising and bright future.

Based on the current study, the following efforts will be made
in future studies toward improving the performance of iLocator.

(1) In this article, we used both the global and local features
as the input to the prediction engine and found that the local
features are sensitive to detect the distribution differences among
multiple locations. Here, we used LBP as the local feature, which
is a baseline texture descriptor. Actually, some LBP variants,
such as local ternary patterns and local quinary patterns, have
been proposed and proven to be powerful in image descriptions
(Nanni et al., 2010b; Paci et al., 2013). Therefore, we will try to
use these LBP variants as a future development.

(2) To handle high-dimensional image feature vectors, the
feature reduction is demonstrated necessary in our experiments

and other studies. The SDA method was used in this article to
select representative features and performed well. As an alterna-
tive, we also tested the random subspace ensemble of SVM, for
it saves the feature selection step, and performs well in other
studies (Paci et al., 2013). According to our experiments, the
random subspace ensemble of the SVM approach is not as
good as the ensemble of BR and CC algorithms used in this
study (data not shown). The reason could be that the random
selected features are not informative to reﬂect the multi-label
samples, and the output of the follow-up single classiﬁers can
cause the ﬂuctuation of the voting results, which are sensitive to
noise. These results demonstrate the importance of the develop-
ment of an effective control mechanism that is able to make the
subspace approach suitable to handle multi-label samples.

(3) Fusion of BR and CC algorithms in iLocator is demon-
strated useful for enhancing the classiﬁcation accuracy of multi-
label samples. The performance of CC mode conﬁrms that
passing association information among labels is able to reﬂect
the different propensities of cellular component co-localizations
of proteins. Thus, for the bioimage—based multi-label protein
classiﬁcation problem, it is also important to dig into the existing
large databases to model the associations among labels.

(4) The sequence-based and image-based protein subcellular
location prediction approaches differ in many ways, including the
feature descriptors and classiﬁcation algorithms. Considering
that they both deal with protein samples, the combination of
the two strategies should help enhance the classiﬁcation accuracy
because of the complementarities, which can also provide a
better understanding of the protein translocations both intui-
tively and at the amino acid level. In the next step, we plan
to explore the idea and combine our 1D sequence-based protein
subcellular location predictor Cell-PLoc (Chou and Shen, 2008)
and the 2D image-based iLocator as developed in this work.

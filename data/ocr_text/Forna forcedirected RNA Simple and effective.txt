Abstract

Motivation: The secondary structure of RNA is integral to the variety of functions it carries out in
the cell and its depiction allows researchers to develop hypotheses about which nucleotides and
base pairs are functionally relevant. Current approaches to visualizing secondary structure provide
an adequate platform for the conversion of static text—based representations to 2D images, but are
limited in their offer of interactivity as well as their ability to display larger structures, multiple
structures and pseudoknotted structures.

Results: In this article, we present forna, a web—based tool for displaying RNA secondary structure
which allows users to easily convert sequences and secondary structures to clean, concise and cus—
tomizable visualizations. It supports, among other features, the simultaneous visualization of mul—
tiple structures, the display of pseudoknotted structures, the interactive editing of the displayed
structures, and the automatic generation of secondary structure diagrams from PDB files. It re—
quires no software installation apart from a modern web browser.

Availability and implementation: The web interface of forna is available at http://rna.tbi.univie.ac.
at/forna while the source code is available on github at \MNw.github.com/pkerpedjiev/forna.

1 Introduction

The use of secondary structure diagrams is ubiquitous within the
field of RNA biology. They convey not only which nucleotides are
paired, but also and perhaps more importantly, which are unpaired.
The contents and positions of sub—structures such as hairpin loops,
interior loops, multiloop junctions and external loops are immedi—
ately evident. Such information is of great value to researchers seek—
ing to identify putative mutations to perform when seeking to
isolate the structural basis of a biological effect, to find protein bind-
ing, and to provide a context for observed behavior. It is used as
both an exploratory as well as a communicative tool. Researchers
examine secondary structure diagrams to gain insights about
potential functions and mechanisms as well as to describe and dis—
seminate them.

Although there are a number of available tools (Byun and Han,
2009; Darty et 61]., 2009; Hecker et 61]., 2013; Wiese et 61]., 2005) for
visualizing the secondary structure of RNA molecules, with the ex—
ception of PseudoViewer, none are available online without java
and none offer the ﬂexibility in exploring, arranging and manipulat-
ing the structure that f orna does (Table 1 for an enumerated com—
parison of features).

2 Approach

Our tool, called f orna (for f orce—directed rna), consists of a web
interface and a server which allows users to input RNA secondary
structures as dot—bracket strings, and displays it as a force—directed
graph (Screenshot in Fig. 1). In a manner previously demonstrated
by jViz.RNA (Wiese et 61]., 2005) the user can then position each of

f orna provides at least three convenient features not found in other programs.

the nucleotides and stems by dragging them. Each of the nucleotides
is represented as a node, whereas backbone and base—pair bonds are
considered links. Connections are treated as springs and a force is
calculated to keep them a fixed distance from each other. Hidden
helper nodes and extra links help to maintain the familiar RNA sec-
ondary structure layout. The initial position of each node (nucleo—
tide) is calculated using the NAView algorithm (Bruccoleri and
Heinrich, 1988), but is subsequently optimized by the force—directed
layout algorithm. This can (especially for larger molecules) lead to
artifacts such as twisted helices and nested loops, but these are easily
rectified by dragging the affected nodes to their correct positions.

2.1 Input/output

Users can enter structures in dot—bracket format (Supplementary
Material Sections 81.3, 81.6 and 81.7). When done, the diagram can
be saved as either a vector (SVG) or raster (PNG) graphic. If one
wishes to edit the structure again in the future, it can be saved and
reloaded in f orna using the JSON format.

2.2 Dragging to position elements

The layout can be rearranged by selecting and dragging single or mul-
tiple nodes. The virtual forces then pull the structure toward an RNA—
like layout with nearly uniform link distances. This behavior is similar
to that available in jViz.Rna and valuable for arranging the nucleo-
tides in a relevant, meaningful or simply aesthetically pleasing manner.

2.3 Pseudoknots and custom links (Supplementary
Material Sections 81.1 and 81.6)

It is often necessary to display the interaction between two
molecules or between different parts of the same molecule (i.e. pseu—
doknots). Although the user can enter pseudoknotted structures in
dot—bracket notation (i.e. ((..[[..))..]]), the pseudoknotted nucleotides
in these cases are added as links with no strength. One may also add
custom links by holding down shift and dragging from one nucleo-
tide to another. This creates a spring—loaded link which can bring
distal portions of a molecule together, or connect separate mol—
ecules. Such links are useful in depicting RNA—RNA interactions.

2.4 Coloring (Supplementary Material Section 31.4)

The coloring of nucleotides is essential for overlaying metadata on top
of a structure. f orna provides three default coloring modes: position,
structure and sequence which color nucleotides according to their pos—
ition in the molecule, the type of structural element they are in (i.e.
stem, interior, hairpin, multi or exterior loop) or their identity (A,C,G

Fig. 1. Screenshot of forna web app displaying the ‘Bacterial Ribonuclease P
Holoenzyme in Complex with tRNA’ (PDB ID: 3010). Immediately evident are
the regions of the tRNA which are in contact with the ribonuclease, namely
the 5’ and 3’ end nucleotides, as well as the T‘I’C loop. An RNA-binding pro-
tein is shown as a gray node in the lower-right hand region of the diagram

or U). A custom coloring mode is provided where bespoke values (as
from probing data) can be entered in a text field.

2.5 Integrated structure prediction (Supplementary
Material Section 81.5)

To simplify the process of going from sequence to secondary struc—
ture, forna provides a transparent interface to the Vienna RNA
Package (Lorenz et al., 2011) which automatically calculates the
minimum free energy for a particular sequence if no secondary struc—
ture is provided. This allows one to paste a sequence in the input
field and immediately view its predicted secondary structure, with—
out using additional tools.

2.6 Tertiary to secondary structure (Supplementary
Material Sections 81.2 and 81.6)

One of the most important and unique features of forna is the
automatic display of secondary structure information given a 3D
structure as a PDB file. forna automatically extracts base—pair
interaction information using MC—Annotate (Gendron et al., 2001)
and displays the canonical secondary structure, which can be
explored, manipulated or colored as described in the previous sec—
tions. Multiple chains are displayed as disconnected graphs. Proteins
are displayed as larger gray nodes and interactions between different
chains are represented as dashed lines (Fig. 1).

2.7 Reusable display container (Supplementary

Material Section 82)

Researchers can effortlessly share RNA structures online by adding
a few lines of javascript to their web page and showing a diagram of
the secondary structure embedded as an SVG container attached to
any specified element in the DOM tree. This rendering is purely cli-
ent side and requires no calls to the server.

3 Conclusion

We provide an easy to use, accessible, free, open—source web tool for
RNA secondary structure visualization that produces beautiful,
highly customizable plots. Our tool requires no externally installed

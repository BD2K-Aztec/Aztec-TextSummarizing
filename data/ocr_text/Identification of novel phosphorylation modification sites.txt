ABSTRACT

Motivation: Phosphorylation modifications of specific protein
residues are involved in a wide range of biological processes such
as modulation of intracellular signal networks. Here, we present
the development and application of a bioinformatics procedure for
systematic identification of human-specific phosphorylation sites
in proteins that may have occurred after the human—chimpanzee
divergence.

Results: We collected annotated human phosphorylation sites and
compared each site to orthologous mammalian proteins across
taxa including chimpanzee, orangutan, rhesus macaque, marmoset,
mouse, dog, cow, elephant, opossum and platypus. We identified 37
human-specific gains of annotated phosphorylation sites in
35 proteins: 22 serines, 12 threonines and 3 tyrosines. The novel
phosphorylation sites are situated in highly conserved segments of
the protein. Proteins with novel phosphorylation sites are involved
in crucial biological processes such as cell division (AURKB,
CASC5, MKI67 and PDCD4) and chromatin remodeling (HIRA,
HIRIP3, HIST1H1T, NAP1 L4 and LRWD1). Modified phosphorylatable
residues produce novel target sites for protein kinases such as
cyclin-dependent kinases and casein kinases, possibly resulting in
rewiring and fine-tuning of phosphorylation regulatory networks. The
potential human-specific phosphorylation sites identified in this study
are useful as candidates for functional analysis to identify novel
phenotypes in humans.

1 INTRODUCTION

Humans have many distinct phenotypic traits compared with the
other great apes, such as loss of body hair, upright posture,
accelerated brain expansion and more complex cognitive abilities
(Varki and Altheide, 2005). These traits must have originated as
genetic modiﬁcations and undergone subsequent natural selection in
the human lineage after humans diverged from their closest liVing
relatives, the chimpanzees. The accelerated sequence substitution

of proteins may be associated with the evolution of certain human-
speciﬁc traits: for example, genes implicated in nervous system
development were found to display signiﬁcantly higher rates of
protein evolution in the human lineage (Dorus et al., 2004). The
FOXP2 protein, which is known to be associated with speech
and language in humans, acquired two amino acid substitutions
speciﬁc to humans after the human—chimpanzee divergence (Enard
et al., 2002). The human FOXP2 protein has been reported to
differentially regulate genes involved in central nervous system
development compared with the chimpanzee ortholog (Konopka
et al., 2009). Interestingly, loss of proteins has also been implicated
in the development of human-speciﬁc traits (Olson, 1999). For
example, inactivation of the M YHI 6 gene in humans may be related
to the reduction of the masticatory muscle and expansion of the brain
(Stedman et al., 2004). Other proteins that became inactive only in
humans include BASE, SERPINA13 and MOXD2 (Hahn and Lee,
2005, 2006; Hahn et al., 2007).

Phosphorylation is a fundamental post-translational modiﬁcation
(PTM) of proteins that acts in many important biological processes,
such as cellular signaling pathways through the modulation of
protein function, stability, interaction and localization (Pawson
and Scott, 2005). Several tens of thousands of phosphorylation
modiﬁcation sites have been characterized in human proteins using
high-throughput proteomic analyses (Beausoleil et al., 2004; Olsen
et al., 2006; Oppermann et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2008). Data
regarding phosphorylation modiﬁcation sites in human proteins are
available Via databases, such as UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (UniProt
Consortium, 2010), PHOSIDA (Gnad et al., 2007) and dbPTM (Lee
et al., 2006).

It is likely that biologically important phosphorylation sites are
evolutionarily conserved (Malik et al., 2008). Tan et al. (2009a)
identiﬁed 479 phosphorylation sites in 344 human proteins that
appear to be positionally conserved between human and at least
one species of ﬂy, worm or yeast and proposed that these sites
are involved in fundamental cellular processes. Nevertheless, the
gain and loss of protein phosphorylation sites may rewire biological
networks and be regarded as a motive force for adaptive evolution
(Shou et al., 2011; Vener, 1990). The gain or loss of phosphorylation
sites in Cdkl substrates in yeasts may have facilitated the evolution
of kinase—signaling circuits (Holt et al., 2009). Tan et al. (2009b)
reported that tyrosine residues have been selectively lost through
metazoan evolution to remove deleterious tyrosine phosphorylations
as tyrosine kinases have been expanded. It is argued that evolution

Human-specific phosphorylation modification sites

 

of phosphorylation regulatory network could play a prime role in
generating phenotypic changes during organismal evolution (Moses
and Landry, 2010). It has been proposed that the human-speciﬁc
serine residue in the human FOXP2 protein may provide a novel
phosphorylation site for protein kinase C (Enard et al., 2002),
although there is no supporting experimental evidence for this
hypothesis.

In this study, we hypothesize that novel phosphorylation sites
in the human proteins that originated after the human—chimpanzee
divergence may have been involved in the evolution of human—
speciﬁc traits through the strengthening and/or rewiring of existing
protein interaction networks. To address this possibility, we
developed a bioinformatics procedure to systematically identify
novel human-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites. Using this procedure,
we identiﬁed 37 novel phosphorylation sites that have arisen in
human proteins. We also identiﬁed 31 phosphorylation sites that
are conserved in humans and other mammals, but have been lost in
the chimpanzee proteins.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and bioinformatics tools

To identify annotated phosphorylation modiﬁcation sites in human
proteins, we downloaded the human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records
from the UniProt database (http://www.uniprot.org/). The HomoloGene
database of the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/homologene) was consulted for the initial
collection of RefSeq accession numbers of orthologous mammalian protein
sequences for each human protein, which were then retrieved from the NCBI
RefSeq database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0V/RefSeq/). The data analyzed
in this study were downloaded on January 4, 2011. Since the HomoloGene
database includes only six mammalian species (human, chimpanzee, mouse,
rat, dog and cow), we also accessed the mammalian genome assemblies
available in the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome
Browser database (http://genome.ucsc.edu) to verify and predict more
orthologous proteins in orangutan, rhesus macaque, marmoset and other non-
primate mammals. The genome assemblies analyzed in this study include
th9 (human), panTro2 (chimpanzee), ponAbe2 (orangutan), rheMac2
(rhesus macaque), calJac3 (marmoset), mm9 (mouse), m4 (rat), canFam2
(dog), felCat4 (cat), bosTau4 (cow), susScr2 (pig), eunab2 (horse), lofor3
(elephant), monDom5 (opossum) and omAnal (platypus).

The MUSCLE program (http://www.drive5.com/muscle/) was used
to construct multiple sequence alignments (Edgar, 2004), which were
then decorated using the BOXSHADE server (http://www.ch.embnet
.org/software/BOX_form.html). Pairwise alignments between cDNAs and
genomic sequences were performed to identify exons using the SIM4
program (http://globin.cse.psu.edu/dist/sim4/) (Florea et al., 1998). We wrote
some ad hoc PERL scripts to manipulate sequences, database records and
software outputs.

2.2 Selection of candidates for gain or loss of
phosphorylation sites during human and
chimpanzee evolution

We downloaded human UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot records for phosphorylation
modiﬁcation site information. For each UniProt record, we examined the
feature table (FT) lines showing post-translationally modiﬁed residues
(key name ‘MOD_RES’). When the lines contained one of the keywords
‘Phosphoserine’, ‘Phosphothreonine’ or ‘Phosphotyrosine’, the sequence
record was collected. A total of 32 750 phosphorylation modiﬁcation sites
were retrieved for 6950 proteins.

To identify potential human-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites, we performed
multiple sequence alignments for each human protein with orthologous
mammalian proteins including chimpanzee proteins. We used the
RefSeq accession numbers in UniProt records as keys to identify the
corresponding HomoloGene datasets. The non-human RefSeq proteins for
each HomoloGene dataset were extracted from the RefSeq protein database
and combined with the UniProt human protein sequence to construct an
orthologous protein sequence set. A total of 6425 orthologous protein sets
were prepared. Multiple sequence alignments were produced using the
MUSCLE program. For each aligned human phosphorylation site, when the
orthologous chimpanzee sequence was not one of three phosphorylatable
residues (serine, threonine or tyrosine), the position was identiﬁed as a
potential human-speciﬁc phosphorylation site. A total of 90 annotated human
phosphorylation sites were found to differ from the orthologous chimpanzee
sequences.

2.3 Manual inspection of datasets

As a ﬁnal step, we manually scrutinized the 90 candidate human
phosphorylation sites to identify human-speciﬁc gains or chimpanzee-
speciﬁc losses of phosphorylation sites. The mammalian ortholog sequences
were retrieved from the HomoloGene database, the NCBI protein sequence
database or predicted from genome assemblies available through the UCSC
Genome Browser database. The sequencing qualities of the chimpanzee
codons corresponding to the human phosphorylated amino acid residues
were examined to ensure that any sequence differences between human and
chimpanzee proteins were not due to sequencing errors.

When chimpanzee and orangutan sequences lacked a phosphorylatable
residue at an aligned human phosphorylation site, we concluded that
the human protein acquired the phosphorylation site after the human—
chimpanzee divergence. When non-chimpanzee primates or other mammals
exhibited the same amino acid sequence as the human phosphorylation site
but the chimpanzee protein had a different sequence, we concluded that
the chimpanzee protein had lost the phosphorylation site after the human—
chimpanzee divergence. Of the 90 candidate sites, 37 were identiﬁed as
unique to human proteins and 31 as lost in chimpanzee proteins. The
remaining 22 cases were discarded due to ambiguous orthology relationship,
incorrect prediction of the chimpanzee protein or low sequence quality of
the orthologous chimpanzee codons.

2.4 Polymorphisms among modern humans and
Neanderthal alleles

To identify possible polymorphisms in the codons for human-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites, we examined human polymorphism information
available Via the UCSC Genome Browser database. The polymorphism data
were drawn from the simple nucleotide polymorphism database (dbSNP)
build 132 and personal genomes including two anonymous Yoruban Africans
(UCSC track name NA19240 and NA18507), three anonymous Europeans
(NA12878, NA12891 and NA12892), J. Craig Venter (Venter), James Watson
(Watson), one anonymous Han Chinese (YH) and one anonymous Korean
(SJK). Detailed information on the SNP data was obtained from dbSNP
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/SNP/).

We also analyzed the Neanderthal sequence data (Green et al., 2010)
available in the UCSC Genome Browser (the ‘Neandertal Alleles in
Human/Chimp Coding Non-synonymous Differences in Human Lineage’
track) to examine Neanderthal alleles.

We examined 32 750 annotated phosphorylation modiﬁcation sites in
6950 human proteins to identify 37 human-speciﬁc phosphorylation

sites in 35 proteins that presumably originated after the human—
chimpanzee divergence (Table 1). Multiple sequence alignments
of phosphorylation sites and the surrounding regions of the
representative proteins are shown in Figure 1. Alignments for all
of the cases are shown in Supplementary Figure 81.

Two proteins, MKI67 and PDXDC1, each acquired two novel
phosphorylation sites, while the remaining 33 proteins acquired one
site each. The amino acid residues of the novel phosphorylation sites
in human proteins include 22 serines, 12 threonines and 3 tyrosines.
Among 37 annotated phosphorylation sites, 36 were experimentally
identiﬁed either by large-scale analyses using mass spectrometry
(35 sites) or by conventional molecular biology method (HIRA
serine 687) (Hall et al., 2001). Eight sites were detected in more
than two independent experiments. None of these 37 sites has yet
been assigned a biological function.

Interestingly, the regions surrounding human-speciﬁc
phosphorylation sites are strongly conserved among mammalian
orthologs, including those of the non-placental mammals opossum
(marsupial) and platypus (monotreme). Representative proteins are
ABCF1, ADNP, BAIAP2L1, HIRA, NAP1L4, NOP2, PDCD4,
RUSC2, SNRPA, TARBP1, TP53BP1 and USP7 (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. 81). The human ABCF1 protein, for example,
has a phosphorylated threonine residue at position 108, where an
alanine residue is found in all other mammals including opossum
and platypus. Proteins that are highly conserved across mammalian
taxa or at least among primates but that have undergone accelerated
amino acid substitution during human evolution are proposed to be
involved in the development of adaptive human phenotypes (Clark
et al., 2003). The proteins identiﬁed in this study exhibit not only
human-speciﬁc amino acid changes but also novel phosphorylation
sites, possibly resulting in dramatic effects on the functions of the
proteins themselves, as well as those of their associated protein
networks.

In four cases (HIRIP3, LRWD1, PAG1 and PDXDC1 serine 737),
human phosphorylation sites produce the same amino acid residues
in non—primate mammals but not in other primates. The human
LRWD1 protein, for example, has a phosphorylated serine at
position 259, where other primates have glycines (Supplementary
Fig. S 1, No. 14). In contrast, some non-primate mammals including
mouse, cat, horse, pig and cow exhibit a serine residue at this
position. Mouse and primates belong to Euarchontoglires and cat,
horse, pig and cow to Laurasiatheria. Therefore, in these cases, it
is probable that phosphorylation sites were acquired in ancestral
proteins before divergence of Euarchontoglires and Laurasiatheria
but were lost in primate ancestors, again becoming phosphorylatable
during human evolution.

3.2 Notable cases of human-speciﬁc gains of
phosphorylation sites

3.2.] ABCF1 The human ABCF1 (also known as ABC50)
protein, which is a member of the superfamily of ATP—binding
cassette (ABC) transporters, has a human-speciﬁc phosphorylated
threonine residue at position 108 (Fig. 1A). The ABCF1 protein
was reported to interact with eukaryotic initiation factor eIF2 and
promote translation initiation in mammalian cells by binding to
ribosomes (Paytubi et al., 2008, 2009). Serine 109 and serine
140 of the ABCF1 protein were found to be phosphorylated
by casein kinase 2 (CK2), and mutations of these sites resulted

in marked decreases in the association of eIF2 with ribosomes
(Paytubi et al., 2008). Currently, the human ABCF1 protein has
nine annotated phosphorylation sites. It is possible that modiﬁcation
of the human-speciﬁc phosphorylation site threonine 108 can
positively or negatively affect the function of the adjacent CK2 target
serine 109.

3.2.2 AURKB and CASC5 The human AURKB and CASC5
proteins acquired novel phosphorylation sites serine 7 and
serine 1076, respectively (Supplementary Fig. Sl, Nos 3 and 7).
The human AURKB protein or aurora kinase B is a serine/threonine
kinase that functions in the attachment of the mitotic spindle
to the centromere during cell division for accurate chromosome
segregation (Lampson et al., 2004). AURKB interacts with many
proteins including INCENP, BIRC5 (also known as SurViVin) and
NINL (also known as Nlp) and modulates their functions Via
phosphorylation (Honda et al., 2003; Yan et al., 2010).

CASC5 (also known as KNL1) has been reported to oppose
AURKB activity by promoting dephosphorylation of AURKB
substrates (Liu et al. , 2010). Interestingly, CASC5 itself is a substrate
for AURKB and is down-regulated by phosphorylation (Welburn
et al., 2010). Both the AURKB and CASC5 proteins exhibit many
phosphorylation targets, with 13 and 21 annotated sites, respectively.
The human—speciﬁc phosphorylation of the AURKB serine 7 and
CASC5 serine 1076 might result in ﬁne adjustments in protein
interaction networks and in the human cell division process.

3.2.3 HIRA, HIRIP3 and NAP1L4 The HIRA protein is an
evolutionarily conserved histone chaperone that preferentially
places the variant histone H33 in nucleosomes and that plays
an important role in the formation of senescence-associated
heterochromatin foci (Zhang et al. , 2005). The HIRIP3 protein is also
a histone—binding protein (Lorain et al., 1998). The human HIRA
and HIRIP3 proteins are heavily phosphorylated, with 14 and 35
annotated sites, respectively. Interestingly, the human HIRA and
HIRIP3 proteins acquired novel phosphorylation targets serine 687
and serine 300, respectively (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 81,
No. 10, respectively). HIRA and HIRIP3 proteins have been reported
to directly interact with each other (Lorain et al. , 1998). The human—
speciﬁc HIRA serine 687 is located in the H2B—binding region
(Lorain et al., 1998) and reported to be phosphorylated by the
cyclin—dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) (Hall et al., 2001).

NAP1L4 is also a histone chaperone that belongs to the
nucleosome assembly protein (NAP) family and can interact with
both core and linker histones (Okuwaki et al., 2010; Rodriguez
et al., 1997). The human NAP1L4 (Fig. 1C) has 13 phosphorylation
sites with one human-speciﬁc site, serine 139. Modiﬁcations of
human HIRA, HIRIP3 and NAP1L4 proteins might be implicated
in chromatin—remodeling evolution.

3.2.4 LWRDI The human LRWD1 [also known as origin
recognition complex-associated (ORCA)] protein mediates the
origin recognition complex (ORC) in chromatin which is critical
for the initiation of pre—replication complex assembly in G1 and
chromatin organization in post-G1 cells (Shen et al., 2010). The
human LRWD1 has seven annotated phosphorylation sites, of which
the serine 259 site is human-speciﬁc. Other primates have a glycine
residue at this position (Supplementary Fig. Sl, No 14).

Fig. 1. Multiple sequence alignments of representative cases of human-speciﬁc gains of phosphorylation sites. The human-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites (*),
shared sites (+) and the surrounding regions (20 aligned positions on both sides) for each case are presented. Residues that were identical in 250% of the
aligned proteins are highlighted with black backgrounds. Opossum NAP1L4 and platypus USP7 exhibit the same phosphorylatable amino acid residue as

does the respective human protein, probably reﬂecting independent gains.

3.2.5 MKI67 and PDCD4 The human MKI67 (also known
as Ki-67) is a nuclear protein that is associated with and may
be necessary for cellular proliferation (Gerdes et al., 1991).
Overexpression of MKI67 is associated with many cancers,
including neuroendocrine carcinomas and colorectal cancers (Erler
et al., 2011; Ma et al. , 2010). The human MKI67 protein, which has
124 phosphorylation sites, acquired two novel phosphorylation sites,
serine 1256 and serine 3042 (Supplementary Fig. Sl, Nos 15 and 16,
respectively). In contrast, the PDCD4 protein is a tumor suppressor
(GOke et al., 2004; Yang et al., 2006). The human PDCD4 protein
acquired a novel phosphorylation site, serine 80, resulting in a total
of nine phosphorylation sites. All other mammals that have been
studied, including opossum and platypus, have an asparagine residue
at this site (Fig. 1D). The mammalian PDCD4 proteins show strong
sequence conservation, indicating that they play important roles in
mammalian biology.

3.2.6 SNRPA and TARBPI The SNRPA protein (also known
as U1A) is associated with stem/loop 2 of the U1 small nuclear
RNA (snRNA) and forms the spliceosomal U1 small nuclear
ribonucleoprotein (snRNP), which is required for mRNA
splicing (Law et al., 2006). The SNRPA proteins are highly
conserved in mammals, and the human SNRPA has a single
novel phosphorylation site, threonine 131 (Fig. 1E). TARBPl
is also an RNA binding protein that was initially identiﬁed
as a binding protein of the human immunodeﬁciency Virus-1
(HIV-1) trans-activation-responsive (TAR) RNA (Sheline
et al., 1991). TARBPl binds directly to DICER1 and loads
small interfering RNA into the RNA-induced silencing
complex (RISC) (MacRae et al., 2008). The human TARBPl
protein also acquired a single novel phosphorylation site,
serine 1442. These modiﬁcations may alter RNA biology in
humans.

Human-specific phosphorylation modification sites

 

3.2.7 USP7 and USP36 The USP7 and USP36 proteins are
cysteine proteases that function as deubiquitinating enzymes (de
Bie et al., 2010; Endo et al., 2009). Protein ubiquitination is
one of the fundamental regulatory PTMs that control intracellular
protein signal networks (Komander, 2009). The human USP7
and USP36 proteins acquired human-speciﬁc phosphorylation
sites, threonine 54 and tyrosine 874, respectively (Fig. 1F and
Supplementary Fig. Sl, No 36, respectively). It is notable that
the threonine 54 of the USP7 protein is embedded in a strongly
conserved region. The newly acquired phosphorylatable residues
of these deubiquitinating enzymes may provide novel regulatory
phosphorylation targets in human cells.

3.3 Polymorphisms among modern humans and
Neanderthal alleles

Human polymorphism data drawn from the UCSC Genome Browser
database were examined to identify possible amino acid—altering
polymorphisms in codons encoding phosphorylated residues. We
found non-synonymous SNPs at the phosphorylation sites in
C10rf131 and NOP2 proteins.

The ﬁrst base of the codon for the C10rf131 protein position
163 shows an A/G polymorphism (dbSNP accession number
rs115635619). The allelic codons are ACA and GCA, encoding
threonine and alanine, respectively. Interestingly, the corresponding
chimpanzee codon is ATA, encoding isoleucine which is common in
other primates, indicating that the both ACA (threonine) and GCA
(alanine) are derived alleles. The frequency data available in dbSNP
show that the ACA (threonine) allele frequency is 98.3% in Africans,
indicating that the phosphorylatable allele is prevalent.

The second base of the codon for the NOP2 protein position 140
exhibits a C/T polymorphism (rs35556146). The codon variants
are ACG and ATG, encoding threonine (derived) and methionine
(ancestral), respectively. The derived phosphorylatable allele is
prevalent in modern humans: 92.5% in Africans and 100% in both
Europeans and Asians.

In a modern human-Neanderthal genome comparison, we have
found that 20 derived sites are shared with Neanderthal DNA,
indicating that the acquisition of these phosphorylatable residues
occurred before the divergence of modern humans and Neanderthals.
No information is available for the rest of the cases.

3.4 Losses of phosphorylation sites in chimpanzee
proteins

When annotated human phosphorylation sites are shared with
other primates and mammals, but different non-phosphorylatable
residues are found in chimpanzees compared with those in the
other animals, we conclude that the phosphorylation site was
lost in chimpanzees after the human—chimpanzee divergence. By
applying this condition, we identiﬁed 31 chimpanzee proteins with
losses of annotated phosphorylation sites (Supplementary Table S 1).
Multiple sequence alignments surrounding the mutated sites are
shown in Supplementary Figure S2. In most cases, the annotated
phosphorylation sites are conserved across mammals except in the
chimpanzee, implying that phosphorylation at the corresponding
position was acquired early in mammalian evolution. For example,
the human ASPM protein residue number 1103 is serine, which
is conserved across mammals including opossum and platypus
(Supplementary Fig. S2, No. 2). However, the chimpanzee protein

has a cysteine residue at the corresponding position. The original
phosphorylated amino acid sequences lost in chimpanzee proteins
include 20 serines, 10 threonines and 1 tyrosine.

4 DISCUSSION

We identiﬁed 37 cases of novel phosphorylation site gains in
35 human proteins that likely arose after the human—chimpanzee
divergence. Human proteins with novel phosphorylation
modiﬁcation sites are involved in various biological processes:
for example, AURKB, CASC5, MKI67, PDCD4 in the cell cycle;
HIRA, HIRIP3, HIST1H1T, NAP1L4 and LRWD1 are involved
in chromatin remodeling; SNRPA and TARBP1 are involved in
RNA biology; and USP7 and USP36 are involved in protein
deubiquitination.

The number of novel phosphorylation sites in human proteins
and the number of lost sites in chimpanzee proteins are very
similar, 37 versus 31, indicating that gain and loss events occurred
at comparable rates in both taxa. The distributions of changed
residues are also similar. The amino acid residues of the 37 novel
human phosphorylation sites include 22 serines, 12 threonines and
3 tyrosines. In chimpanzee proteins, 20 serines, 10 threonines and
1 tyrosine have been mutated to non-phosphorylatable residues. The
conversion to or from serine is more frequent than other conversions.
This difference may be explained in terms of the numbers of codons
in the genetic code. There are six codons for serine, four for threonine
and two for tyrosine. If a mutation is completely random, it is likely
that the serine codon will appear more often than will threonine or
tyrosine.

The distribution of the lost phosphorylatable residues may
simply be due to the frequencies of the phosphorylated residues
in the proteome. The human protein dataset analyzed in this
study contains 23 977 phosphoserines, 5610 phosphothreonines and
3163 phosphotyrosines. Because phosphoserine is more common
than phosphothreonine or phosphotyrosine, it is expected that
phosphoserine is lost more often at similar mutation rates. However,
we cannot rule out the possibility that there could be evolutionary
constraints regarding the gain or loss of phosphorylation sites. It
is possible that the relatively small number of gain or loss of
phosphotyrosine sites reﬂects the fact that phosphotyrosine sites
are involved in more biologically important processes than are
phosphothreonine or phosphoserine sites. It has been proposed
that, as tyrosine kinases have been expanded during metazoan
evolution, tyrosine residues have been selectively removed to
minimize possibly deleterious tyrosine phosphorylations (Tan et al. ,
2009b).

The casein kinase 1 (CK1) family of protein kinases functions
as signal transduction pathway regulators in eukaryotic cells and
recognizes the motif S-X-X-S/T* (Gnad et al., 2007). The three
novel phosphorylation sites of ABCF1, MKI67 (serine 1256) and
TARBP1 match the CK1 motif. CK2 has been implicated in several
cellular processes including cell-cycle control and DNA repair, and
it recognizes the motif S/T*-X-X-E, where E is aspartic acid (Gnad
et al., 2007). There are six human-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites
(ABCF1, ADNP, PDXDC1 serine 737 and serine 779, RUSC2 and
USP7) that match the CK2 motif. We assume that the advent of new
target sites for the various kinases in these proteins may result in
evolution of protein regulatory networks. There are four CK1 sites

(C17orf56, EIF4G1, NEK1 and PLEKHG3) and three CK2 sites
(BSN, CENPF and PRR11) that are lost in chimpanzee proteins.

The CDKs recognize the consensus sequence S/T*-P-X-K/R,
where S/T* is the phosphorylated serine or threonine, P is proline,
X is any amino acid, K is lysine and R is arginine (Moses et al.,
2007). They also weakly recognize the sequence S/T*-P. Among 37
novel human-speciﬁc phosphorylation sites, two cases (BAIAP2L1
and HIRA) match the strong consensus and 12 cases (BAIAP2L1,
CASC5, HIRA, HIST1H1T, LRWD1, RCSD1, RRP8, RUSC2,
SNRPA, SVIL and TJP2) match the weak consensus. Similarly,
out of 31 sites lost in chimpanzee, two (GBF1 and MELK) and
10 cases (C17orf56, CCNO, COPB2, EIF4G1, EPN1, MEK1,
RAD52, TP53BP1, WDR62 and WRAP53) match the strong and
weak consensus sequences, respectively.

The similar rate of phosphorylation site gain in humans and loss
in chimpanzees is consistent with the previous report that CDK
consensus sites in clusters turn over rapidly (Moses et al., 2007).
When we examined surrounding regions of the phosphorylation
sites, either gained in humans or lost in chimpanzees, we found
at least one additional phosphorylation site within a 20-residue
distance in 26 human-speciﬁc gains and in 21 chimpanzee—speciﬁc
losses. And hence, in about two-thirds of the cases, gain or loss
of phosphorylation site occurred in clusters. Nevertheless, gain
of novel phosphorylation sites may drive regulatory evolution
as demonstrated that acquisition of CDK consensus sites in
a replication protein Mcm3 is associated with the evolution
of CDK-mediated shuttling of mini-chromosome maintenance
complex in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Moses et al., 2007).

The UniProt database annotation records include pho sphorylation
sites of non-human proteins. In a parallel study, we surveyed
sites to identify human-speciﬁc loss of ancestral phosphorylation
sites. We retrieved data for 21374 phosphorylation sites (14 328
serines, 3714 threonines and 3332 tyrosines) in 5618 non—human
proteins. However, we were unable to identify any instances
of human-speciﬁc loss, probably because most of the annotated
phosphorylation sites in non-human proteins available in the UniProt
database were not determined in independent experiments, but
were deduced based on sequence similarities to human protein
phosphorylation data. Use of high-throughput analysis data for
non-human mammals, such as recently reported phosphorylation
data for mouse tissues (Huttlin et al., 2010), may enable us
to collect human-speciﬁc loss of phosphorylation sites in the
future.

We also encountered limitations of the HomoloGene and RefSeq
databases. We found that many of the predicted chimpanzee protein
sequences in the RefSeq database are not complete or are not
accurate, possibly due to the draft quality of the current chimpanzee
assembly (Taudien et al., 2006). If high-quality chimpanzee protein
sequences are eventually obtained, we may be able to identify more
instances of gain and loss of phosphorylation sites and other PTM
sites.

The procedure presented in this study may be applied to
other PTM sites such as N -glycosylation, 0-glycosylation,
acetylation, methylation, SUMOylation, ubiquitination,
glycosylphosphatidylinositol anchoring and proteolytic cleavage
sites. We are currently researching these modiﬁcations. Recent
advancements in large-scale analyses of the human proteomes
have greatly increased the amount of PTM data that is available
(Gnad et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2006). Through the analysis of these

large datasets, our knowledge of the evolution of PTM sites and
associated protein networks will be greatly expanded.

In conclusion, we identiﬁed 37 novel phosphorylation sites
in human proteins that arose after the human—chimpanzee
divergence. We propose that functional study of these human-
speciﬁc phosphorylation candidates may explain the molecular
mechanism of some human-speciﬁc phenotypes.

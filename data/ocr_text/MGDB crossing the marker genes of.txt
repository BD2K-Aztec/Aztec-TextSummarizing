ABSTRACT

Summary: The microarrays performed by scientific teams grow expo-
nentially. These microarray data could be useful for researchers
around the world, but unfortunately they are underused. To fully exploit
these data, it is necessary (i) to extract these data from a repository of
the high-throughput gene expression data like Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) and (ii) to make the data from different microarrays
comparable with tools easy to use for scientists. We have developed
these two solutions in our server, implementing a database of micro-
array marker genes (Marker Genes Data Base). This database con-
tains the marker genes of all GEO microarray datasets and it is
updated monthly with the new microarrays from GEO. Thus, re-
searchers can see whether the marker genes of their microarray are
marker genes in other microarrays in the database, expanding the
analysis of their microarray to the rest of the public microarrays. This
solution helps not only to corroborate the conclusions regarding a
researcher’s microarray but also to identify the phenotype of different
subsets of individuals under investigation, to frame the results with
microarray experiments from other species, pathologies or tissues,
to search for drugs that promote the transition between the studied
phenotypes, to detect undesirable side effects of the treatment
applied, etc. Thus, the researcher can quickly add relevant information
to his/her studies from all of the previous analyses performed in other
studies as long as they have been deposited in public repositories.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since 2002, the Nature journals, among others, have announced
that authors were thereafter required to deposit microarray data in
public repositories like Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett
et al., 2011) or ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2007) so that anyone
could freely access and critically evaluate the data discussed in
manuscripts (Nature, 2002). But how could all of these data help
your particular research? How could all of this information enrich
your microarray data analysis to make conclusions, to formulate
hypotheses or even to construct new models from them?

To date, GEO archives ~20 000 studies comprising 500000
samples, 33 billion individual measurements for >l300

organisms, submitted by 8000 laboratories from around the
world, and supporting data for >10 000 published manuscripts
(Barrett et al., 2011).

Samples within GEO datasets are further grouped and classi-
fied into subsets according to the experimental variables under
examination in each study, for instance ‘tissue’ or ‘strain’. So,
any gene of the microarray will be a marker gene of the micro-
array if its expression displays a significant effect in relation to
subsets, that is, if the expression values pass a threshold of stat-
istical difference between any experimental-variable subset and
another (Barrett et al., 2011).

The experimental variables are based on the sample origin,
such as species, specimen, strain, individual, tissue, development
stage, cell type, cell line, on individual features like age or gender,
on pharmacological experimentation such as agent, dose, proto-
col, on the disease genesis such as genotype/variation, disease
state, infection, shock, stress or on other experimental conditions
like temperature or time.

How can we establish a correspondence between these sample
subsets perfectly classified by experimental variable and the
sample clusters obtained by statistical methods from our micro-
array under study? We can do this by verifying that marker genes
are the same in both microarrays, similar to CMAP (Lamb et al.,
2006), because it can imply that the subsets of both microarrays
describe the same phenotypes.

So, although the experimental-variable subsets of GEO
microarrays are defined by microarray developers, and the
experimental variables are subjected to the hypothesis that
the researchers wanted to investigate, these micrroarray
data can be reused for investigations around the world even
when their hypotheses are completely different from the
originals.

Our tool can be used for different purposes:

1. To study the role of marker genes of the user’s microarray in
other microarrays.

2. To assign biological meaning to the sample clusters of the
user’s microarray. This can include the following:

2.1. To compare the user’s experiments with experiments for
the same pathology but in different tissues, in different
species or directly different pathologies.

2.2. To search for drugs whose effect causes the transition
between the phenotypes studied in the user’s
microarray.

MGDB: crossing the marker genes of a user microarray with a database of public-microarrays marker genes

 

2.3. To study the phenotype of different subsets of individ-
uals under investigation.

2.4. To search undesirable side effects of a treatment studied
in the user’s microarray.

2 METHODOLOGY

Database of microarray marker genes: The samples of GEO
microarray datasets are classiﬁed by experimental variable such
as treatment, protocol, disease state, patients’ condition, tissue.
So, our database of microarray marker genes contains the genes
with statistically signiﬁcant differences in their expression be-
tween any experimental variable subset and another for each
GEO microarray. The system obtains these marker genes directly
from GEO. The database is updated monthly with the marker
genes of the new GEO datasets.

Marker-gene search in the user’s microarray: The deﬁnition of
sample clusters and the marker-gene search in the user’s micro-
array is totally versatile. Our system provides the sample clusters
calculated by common clustering methods (HC, SOM, SOTA) or
allows the researcher to deﬁne them based on his/her hypothesis.
The marker genes can be searched for by having some of the
clusters being upregulated or downregulated with respect to the
basal value, or by being overexpressed or underexpressed with
respect to other clusters. All possible combinations are allowed
and different combinations will supply different sets of marker
genes (Huerta et al., 2009). This procedure permits the researcher
to limit the search of matching microarrays to a speciﬁc pheno-
typic change.

Crossing the user’s microarray marker genes with the database
of microarray marker genes: By comparing the marker genes of
the user’s sample clusters with the marker genes of the database,
the system returns all microarrays with common marker genes
with respect to the speciﬁc search for the user’s microarray.
Then, the correspondence between the sample-clusters of the
user’s microarray and the matching microarrays can be eluci-
dated using the graphical interface (Fig. l). A correspondence
can be established between two clusters if the common marker
genes overexpressed in one cluster are overexpressed in the other.

3 RESULTS

When our application crosses the marker genes of the user’s
microarray sample clusters with the database of microarray
marker genes, two types of lists are provided:
List-of-microarrays View: The list of matching microarrays is
ordered by the number of marker genes in common between the
user’s microarray speciﬁc search and the matching microarrays.
The list of microarrays can be ﬁltered by the experimental vari-
able, like ‘agent’, ‘dose’ or ‘time’, to limit the search to a concrete
scope, or by keywords like ‘breast cancer’. The common marker
genes between the user’s microarray and each matching micro-
array can be analyzed in the list-oﬁmarker-genes view.
List-of-marker-genes View: The common marker genes between
the two microarrays are listed. The cluster distribution along the

Fig. 1. The list of marker-genes view. The common marker genes be-
tween a matching microarray from GEO and the user’s microarray are
listed. The distribution of the clusters along the gene expression is shown
for each gene and the two microarrays. Comparing the two bar charts of
each marker gene the researcher can establish the correspondences be-
tween the clusters of his/her microarray and the subsets of the GEO
microarray. Dist value shows the difference in expression among the
clusters speciﬁed in the marker-gene search

gene expression is shown for each marker gene and both micro-
arrays. In this way, the researcher can quickly establish the cor-
respondence between the clusters of his/her own microarray and
the public microarray. The more microarrays satisfactorily com-
pared, the more attributes that can be assigned to the user’s
microarray sample clusters, which could have been calculated
by statistical methods and, thus, their biological signiﬁcance be
unknown.

As a result, the user can enrich his/her microarray data ana-
lysis and sample clusters, improve his/her future experimental
design and check the hypotheses generated from the data in
the ways cited in the Section 1.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The accuracy of reference genomes is important for
downstream analysis but a low error rate requires expensive manual
interrogation of the sequence. Here, we describe a novel algorithm
(Iterative Correction of Reference Nucleotides) that iteratively aligns
deep coverage of short sequencing reads to correct errors in
reference genome sequences and evaluate their accuracy.

Results: Using Plasmodium falciparum (81% A+T content) as an
extreme example, we show that the algorithm is highly accurate
and corrects over 2000 errors in the reference sequence. We
give examples of its application to numerous other eukaryotic and
prokaryotic genomes and suggest additional applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although there are now over 5000 whole genome sequences in the
public databases, their level of accuracy varies considerably. The
aspiration set by the Human Genome Project was for a maximum
of one error per 10 kb of ﬁnished sequence (International Human
Genome Sequencing Consortium, 2001). However, the true error
rate varies signiﬁcantly from this ﬁgure depending on the nature
of the sequence (base composition, repeats, etc.) both in human
and in other organisms. Even to achieve this error rate, expensive
manual ﬁnishing is required to ensure that each base is covered by
at least 2 clones and has a cumulative Phred score of at least 40
(Ewing and Green, 1998). The ‘Gold Standard’ for quality involves
the manual inspection of each base by an experienced ﬁnisher. This
is a major expense within a genome project. For example, nine
chromosomes of Plasmodium falciparum were completed at the
Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute (Hall et al., 2002), by the equivalent
of approximately seven ﬁnishers working for up to 5 years. Despite
this and subsequent efforts since publication, as we show here, many
errors are still present. Even in genomes described as completed or
ﬁnished, the underlying quality at each base is unknown and the error
rate can be variable genome—wide. Therefore, rapidly ﬁxing errors,
highlighting regions that are error—prone and quantifying accuracy
genome—wide is a priority that will signiﬁcantly beneﬁt the end user.

So far, few methods exist to correct genomic errors
automatically. There are algorithms to improve base calling
(Gajer et al., 2004) or to detect frameshifts by protein
homology or by sequence analysis. New assembly software like
Mira (http://www.chevreux.org/projects_mira.html) has also been
developed that allows hybrid assemblies with different sequencing
technologies. This can both assemble mixed Sanger/454 data and
improve the homopolymer length errors in 454 technologies using
high Illumina read coverage. To date, however, no methods exist
that can accurately detect and correct base errors and small indels
in genome sequences.

We have developed an algorithm that uses deep coverage
of sequence reads produced using Illumina’s Genome Analyser
platform, mapped iteratively to a reference genome, in a way that
allows conﬁdent sequence correction.

2 METHODS

Due to their short length, mapping reads from second generation sequencing
platforms is highly susceptible to single base errors or small indels. Small
corrections made to a reference can, therefore, improve the mapability of
short reads and, conversely, introducing small errors in a reference will
markedly reduce mapability. We have made use of this fact in developing a
new methodology to automatically correct base errors and short insertions
or deletions (indels) of up to 3 bp. In an iterative process, short reads are
mapped against the genome and high—quality discrepancies and indels are
identiﬁed and corrected. In each iteration, we compare the coverage of
perfectly mapping reads at each corrected base before and after correction.
Corrections that reduce the read coverage at that position are rejected. In this
way, we evaluate whether each potential correction is accurate or not. We
repeat the iterations until no new corrections are called.

2.1 Data

For the Rfalciparum reference sequence, we used 3D7 version 2.1.4
(ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/pathogens/Plasmodium/falciparum/3D7/3D7.
version2.1.4/). All Illumina data were produced within the Sanger
sequencing facility. The protocol to obtain PCR—free data is described in
Kozarewa er al. (2009). Preparation of other samples can be seen in Quail
et al. (2008).

2.2 Iterative Correction of Reference Nucleotides
Implementation

An overview of Iterative Correction of Reference Nucleotides (iCORN) is
given in Figure 1. The program itself is hosted at http://icom.sourceforge.net/.
Short reads are ﬁrst mapped with SSAHA2 (Ning er al., 2001) against
the genome sequence that is to be corrected (although another mapping
algorithm could be used, e.g. Li et al., 2008). Standard Illumina mapping

values are used with the ‘paired’ option when reads are paired. Read
pairs that do not map within the correct insert size constraint, map to
different chromosomes or are in the wrong orientation, are ignored. Using
the SSAHA pileup pipeline (ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/zn1/ssaha_pileup/),
single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and short indels (1—3 bp) are called
from the remaining read pairs. Note that, each ‘SNP’ or ‘indel’ called by the
software refers to potential sequencing errors or sample heterogeneity. A SNP
is accepted if it has a SSAHA SNP quality of at least 60. Short indels are
called if they occur in at least 30% of the reads with a minimum read coverage
of at least 5. These parameters are the standard values but can be changed.
The called SNP and indel errors are corrected in the genome sequence and
saved as a new version.

To evaluate the corrections, the coverage of each base before correction
is compared to that after correction using SNP—o—matic (Manske and
Kwiatkowski, 2009) that only maps reads mapping perfectly over their whole
length. If read coverage of a corrected base goes down, the change is rejected
and the original sequence is restored. If there is no change in coverage, we
assume that this region may have additional errors and accept the correction.

The procedure is repeated, using the newly corrected genome sequence as
the reference and continues to iterate until no new errors can be found. The
algorithm returns all changes, including coverage statistics, in GFF format
[visible with Artemis (Carver et al., 2008)] or as Gap4 feature ﬁle.

3 RESULTS

To calibrate the SSAHA2 alignment score threshold to detect real
base errors but minimize false positives, all calls on a single
chromosome at different calling thresholds were manually inspected
by an experienced professional ﬁnisher. This involved interrogating
the capillary reads and their quality scores in a GAP4 database.
Using a SSAHA SNP score of 60 (reﬂecting a base coverage of
:20) resulted in all of the corrections being conﬁrmed. This score
was subsequently adopted for future analyses.

We ﬁrst applied our algorithm to the genome sequence of
P. falciparum: a reference sequence whose low complexity results
from an extremely biased base composition (19% G+C content)

and presents a challenge to short read alignment algorithms due
to its exceptionally low information content. For the analysis, we
used 28 million 36 bp paired—end and 20 million 76 bp paired—end
Illumina reads. The mean coverage obtained by mapping read pairs
with the correct fragment size was 82.9X and we used a minimum
coverage of 20—fold to call changes (see Section 2). An example
of a corrected region can be seen in Figure 2. The coverage plots
show that the amount of mapping reads and perfectly mapping reads
increase with each iteration.

After 6 iterations, no new corrections were called. We found
a total of 1906 base errors and 368 indels. In the ﬁrst iteration,
81% of the base errors were corrected. After the corrections, the
coverage of 84 827 more bases pairs increased to at least 5 and 87 952
additional reads were perfectly mapped. For most chromosomes,
the single base error detection drops to zero after the ﬁfth iteration
(Supplementary Table S 1). Intitially, we found 208 sites (SNP score
:60) that appear to be heterozygous in this haploid organism, using a
cutoff of 15% of calls of an alternative base. Visual inspection of the
areas in which these heterozygous calls occurred, however, revealed
that the majority (75%) were roughly symmetrically distributed
around homopolymeric tracts. The remainder appears to be strand
speciﬁc as they only occur in one read direction and are clustered in
general in sequences that are rich in T and G bases. These calls were
not present in the original capillary sequence data and we believe
them to be hitherto unreported systematic errors occurring during
Illumina sequencing (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Ninety—six percent of the genome is covered by a read depth of
:20, so that we were unable at this level of conﬁdence to correct the
remaining 4% of the genome. These regions are mostly telomeric
and non—unique.

To test the accuracy of our algorithm, we randomly introduced
approximately one error per 50 kb into the 3D7 sequence 2.1.4,
inserting a total of 457 errors and used the Illumina reads to
correct this altered genome using iCORN. In the ﬁrst iteration,
435 (96%) of the errors were found (Supplementary Table S2).
As the errors were generated randomly, they were not clustered

Sequence quality: ‘A’ indicates manually ﬁnished and published genomes and ‘B’ indicates a draft assembly. SNPs and Indels shows the total number called between the ﬁrst and
last iteration. Rejected indicates the total number of changes that were rejected because they decreased the total of perfectly mapping reads at that location. Percent genome covered
indicates how many bases are covered at least ﬁve times by perfectly mapping reads, before and after the correction. New mapable reads indicates the additional number of reads
that could be mapped by SSAHA between the ﬁrst and last iteration. Further information can be found in Supplementary Table S3.

and could be found quickly. The random distribution also explains
that 4% of the introduced errors cannot be found, as 4% of the
genome is not covered sufﬁciently to be corrected, (Supplementary
Table S1).

We further evaluated the performance of iCORN by manually
inspecting the capillary chromatograms of called errors in
chromosomes 5, 9 and 14. Of 174 corrected errors, 1 was rejected.
This region comprised a string of 45 As with a G in the middle
and was re—sequenced following polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
ampliﬁcation. This conﬁrmed the presence of the G that had been
erroneously corrected by iCORN to an A. We suspect that this may
be due to the fact that polyA sequences are over represented in
Illumina data because of occasional edge effects on the slide. Finally,
we designed an additional 96 PCR products over regions with
correction. Eighty—eight out of 96 PCR reactions were successful
and in no case did the PCR product sequence disagree with the
changes called by iCORN.

We next went on to assess the utility of this approach to correct
the homopolymer errors that can occur using 454 technology
(Droege and Hill, 2008). We applied it to a 454 assembly of
310 242 reads (fragment size 3kb) from Rberghei. The contigs
from the assembly were corrected with ~50 million 76 bp PCR—
free paired—end Illumina reads. After 6 iterations, 25 976 SNPs and
33 860 indels were called (Table 1). Figure 3A shows a typical
example where multiple frameshifts due to homopolymer errors are
corrected after just two iterations. Figure 3B shows similar data from
the correction of a 454 assembly of Clostridium diﬁicile using deep
Illumina coverage. In both cases more indels than SNPs are called
due to homopolymer errors.

Finally, we applied iCORN to a series of other eukaryotic
and prokaryotic genome projects in various stages of completion
(Table 1). For ﬁnished bacterial genomes, very few or no corrections
were made. For those in draft assembly, it was possible to call a
number of errors in relatively few iterations. This is presumably

because bacteria generally have higher coverage, are shorter and
have a less complex genome structure than eukaryotes. All errors
in Yersinia enterocolitica and Streptococcus suis were conﬁrmed by
manual inspection of the trace ﬁles.

4 DISCUSSION

Here, we have shown that iterative mapping of short reads can
correct errors remaining in a reference genome with great accuracy.
Critical to the success of this approach is the use of two different
mapping strategies during the iterations. High—quality discrepancies
called using SSAHA2 are introduced into the genome and only
conﬁrmed if a separate mapping of perfectly aligning reads along
their whole length using SNP—o—matic does not decrease coverage
at the altered sites. Iterative mapping approaches have been used
before to derive a consensus genome sequence from metagenomic
sequencing data (Dutilh et al., 2009) but since this derives
from aggregated sequences from an unknown number of starting

genotypes, the resulting consensus represents no single genome and
hides much of the diversity present in the original sequence pool.

We have also shown that, after very few iterations, iCORN is
efﬁcient at correcting homopolymer errors that are often present
in 454 data, thus potentially improving the ability to combine
assemblies constructed using different sequencing technologies.

We have explored the use of iCORN to ‘morph’ a reference
genome into a closely related genotype using deep short read
coverage. Although this approach may produce erroneous sequence
changes, we have found that it has been very successful in improving
the mapping of assembled contigs from a new genotype onto a
reference genome.

Finally, with third generation sequencing technology on the
horizon, bringing gigabase coverage from much longer read lengths
but with an increase in error rates, the use of additional Illumina
reads and algorithms such as iCORN may be of considerable use in
ﬁrst—pass error correction.

ABSTRACT

Connections between disease phenotypes and drug effects can be
made by identifying commonalities in the associated patterns of dif-
ferential gene expression. Searchable databases that record the im-
pacts of chemical or genetic perturbations on the transcriptome—here
referred to as ‘connectivity maps’—permit discovery of such com-
monalities. We describe two R packages, gCMAP and gCMAPWeb,
which provide a complete framework to construct and query connect-
ivity maps assembled from user-defined collections of differential gene
expression data. Microarray or RNAseq data are processed in a stan-
dardized way, and results can be interrogated using various well-
established gene set enrichment methods. The packages also feature
an easy-to—deploy web application that facilitates reproducible re-
search through automatic generation of graphical and tabular reports.
Availability and implementation: The gCMAP and gCMAPWeb R
packages are freely available for UNIX, Windows and Mac OS X oper-
ating systems at Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org).

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray and RNAseq technologies enable the study of tran-
scriptional changes triggered by experimental perturbations.
Gene expression changes observed after one perturbation often
resemble those produced by others, suggesting a shared biolo-
gical mechanism (Lamb et al., 2006). This strategy for establish-
ing links between perturbations can then be used, for example, to
identify bioactive compounds (Kunkel et al., 2011; Stumpel et al.,
2012), elucidate their mode of action (Coombs et al., 2012) or
reposition approved pharmaceuticals for use in new indications
(Dudley et al., 2011). Standalone tools (Subramanian et al.,
2005), modular software libraries (Pacini et al., 2013) or hosted
web applications are available to query the original Connectivity
Map (Lamb et al., 2006), but tools that allow users to easily
compile and search their own reference datasets are lacking.
The gCMAP package provides utilities and memory-efﬁcient
structures to create, store and query large experimental datasets.
gCMAP also provides a uniﬁed R command-line interface to
multiple gene set enrichment (GSE) approaches, permitting
their use for querying user-created connectivity maps as well as
more traditional gene set collections—e.g. Gene Ontology,
Reactome or WikiPathways (Jupe et al., 2012; Kelder et al.,

2012). In addition, the companion gCMAPWeb package pro-
vides a customizable browser-based graphical user interface,
and can leverage R’s built-in web server or be integrated into a
production-scale server.

2 FEATURES

To compile a new connectivity map, users supply expression data
in the form of standard Bioconductor ExpressionSet objects.
gCMAP provides convenience functions to split large studies
into individual perturbation instances and process them in
batch, taking advantage of the widely used limma (Smyth,
2004) and DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010) Bioconductor pack-
ages. QC metrics permit removal of unsuitable experiments, e. g.
those suffering from normalization artifacts (Supplementary
Material). To allow memory-efﬁcient access to large datasets,
results are stored on disk and data subsets are loaded on demand.

gCMAP represents gene set membership and (optionally) dir-
ection of expression change via sparse numerical matrices,
enabling efﬁcient GSE analysis using matrix operations.
Analysis of complete differential expression proﬁles, which re-
tains more information than gene sets, is also supported, permit-
ting permutation—based assessment of statistical signiﬁcance.

gCMAP implements several well-established GSE methods,
including Fisher’s exact test, the original GSEA statistic (Lamb
et al., 2006), the JG score (Jiang and Gentleman, 2007), mgsa
(Bauer et al., 2011) and Roast Wu et al., 2010). All gCMAP
implementations use common input and output formats,
enabling direct comparisons among the supported statistics.

The gCMAP Web package complements gCMAP by providing
a graphical user interface through a distributable web application.
gCMAP Web leverages R’s built-in web server, permitting single-
user access on any computer running R, and can also be inte-
grated into an Apache web server in a multiuser environment. To
submit queries, users can paste gene identiﬁers directly into a web
form or upload text ﬁles (Supplementary File S1). gCMAPWeb
returns results in graphical and tabular form, with detail at the
gene set and single-gene levels (Fig. 1). Every report, including
graphs, tables and a binary R object, is available for download.
The gCMAPWeb user interface is automatically conﬁgured to
match reference datasets but can be easily customized.

3 EXAMPLES

We used gCMAP to reconstruct the original Connectivity
Map Lamb et a]. (2006), containing 453 individual perturbations
in ﬁve human cell lines, from raw microarray data (ArrayExpress
E—GEOD-5258, Supplementary File S1). We then used
gCMAPWeb to query this dataset with genes found to be

to the experiment corresponding to the query itself (blue dot). (C) Distribution of Z—scores indicating differential expression following MG— 132 treatment

up- or downregulated in MCF7 cells treated with the NFKB
inhibitor 15-6 prostaglandin J2. Top hits included MG—l32/Z-
Leu-Leu-Leu—CHO and celastrol, two known inhibitors of the
same pathway (Fig. 1).

To assess differential expression from count data, gCMAP
leverages the widely used DESeq package (Anders and Huber,
2010). To re-examine the transcriptional response of HepG2 cells
to the carcinogen Benzo[a]pyrene [van Delft et al. (2012), ENA
accession SRP011233, Supplementary File S2], we constructed a
local gene set collection from WikiPathways (Kelder et al., 2012)
and queried it with genes signiﬁcantly up- or downregulated in
response to Benzo[a]pyrene. In concordance with the original
study, gCMAPWeb reported signiﬁcant overlap between the
query and the Benzo[a]pyrene metabolism and Nrf2/Keaf 1 path-
ways [van Delft et al. (2012), Supplementary File S1].

4 CONCLUSION

The gCMAP Bioconductor packages combine powerful com-
mand-line functionality with a convenient portable web applica-
tion. The efﬁcient handling of large datasets empowers users to
assemble large connectivity maps from private or public data,
query them programmatically or through an interactive user
interface and store queries and results in a reproducible report.

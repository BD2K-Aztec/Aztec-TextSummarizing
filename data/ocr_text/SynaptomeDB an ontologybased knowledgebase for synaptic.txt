ABSTRACT

Motivation: The synapse is integral to the function of the brain
and may be an important source of dysfunction underlying many
neuropsychiatric disorders. Consequently, it is an excellent candidate
for large-scale genomic and proteomic study. However, while the
tools and databases available for the annotation of high-throughput
DNA and protein are generally robust, a comprehensive resource
dedicated to the integration of information about the synapse is
lacking.

Results: We present an integrated database, called SynaptomeDB,
to retrieve and annotate genes comprising the synaptome.
These genes encode components of the synapse including
neurotransmitters and their receptors, adhesion/cytoskeletal
proteins, scaffold proteins, membrane transporters. SynaptomeDB
integrates various and complex data sources for synaptic genes
and proteins.

1 INTRODUCTION

The synapse is fundamental to the structure and function of
the brain through its role in connecting neurons into circuits
(Chua et al., 2010). As a result, the synapse is an excellent
target of large-scale study of neuropsychiatric disorders. Over
the past decade, the number of identiﬁed synaptic proteins has
increased dramatically, creating a need for a comprehensive resource
to integrate information about synaptic genes and proteins (the
‘synaptome’) from multiple heterogeneous sources. These genes
encode components of the synapse including neurotransmitters and
their receptors, adhesion/cytoskeletal proteins, scaffold proteins,
transporters and others (Wu et al., 2010). Here, we report on an
integrated database, SynaptomeDB, which provides a detailed and
experimentally veriﬁed annotation of all known synaptic proteins.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The development of SynaptomeDB has been motivated by a desire
to have a database that can interoperate with different resources by
simply storing the object keys (database identiﬁers), some important
attributes such as symbol and name, and the relationships among
the objects. The database does not actually store large objects, like
sequence records, but built-in web services can retrieve the subset
of objects of interest on demand from other sources such as EBI and
NCBI.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection

The human synaptome protein list was compiled from a review of all peer-
reviewed proteomics studies from 2004 to 2010, as well from as publicly
available databases that included proteins in the post- and, pre-synapse, the
presynaptic active zone and the synaptic vesicle (Abul-Husn et al., 2009;
Zhang et al., 2007). To date, more than 2200 published studies have reported
data on post— or pre-synaptic genes and proteins, active zone and vesicles.
Synaptome genes were annotated based on RefSeq (GRCh37/hg19) and
UCSC (hg19) to identify human orthologs. We further annotated these genes
by querying 42 databases covering all aspects of biology, including genes,
proteins, pathways and other biological concepts. Both the annotation and
curation processes are fully automated and can be executed regularly. The
ﬂowchart of the SynaptomeDB construction along with sample queries and
explanation of curation process are illustrated in Supplementary Material
1. SynaptomeDB is a gene-centered relational database. It relies primarily
on existing database identiﬁers derived from community databases such
as NCBI, GO (Ashbumer et al., 2000), EBI (Goujon et al., 2010) and
Ensembl (Flicek et al., 2011) as well as the known relationships among
those identiﬁers based on the NCBI Refseq (Mudunuri et al., 2000). The
Relational database makes it possible to enhance the SynaptomeDB as an
extensible platform for integration with other environments such as variation
analysis. Regular updates of the database will be performed to incorporate
new information. First, the annotation process will be performed on new
genes. A simple update will then be executed to populate the other data
in the database. The relational structure of the database allows updates to
populate automatically in all related ﬁelds. Regular updates of the database
will be performed weekly to incorporate new information.

2.2 Pathway enrichment

The Overrepresentation analysis (Fury et al., 2006), detailed in
Supplementary Material 2, was performed against a collection of
gene sets curated in the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB)

(Liberzon et al., 2011) to identify pathways that are enriched for synaptic
genes, which can inform subsequent biological analyses. Here, the proportion
of genes in a given pathway appearing on the SynaptomeDB list is compared
with the proportion of genes not appearing on the list, and a hypergeometric
test (Holmans, 2010) is performed to test for differences in these proportions.
This analysis is also fully automated and can be updated as new genes and
sets are identiﬁed.

3 RESULTS

We assembled a list of genes (n: 1886) that encode all known
proteins of the synapse. This comprises 575 genes encoding proteins
in the presynaptic nerve terminal and active zone, 107 from the
synaptic vesicles and 1755 from the postsynaptic density (there
is some overlap between categories). The list includes strong
candidates for a number of neuropsychiatric disorders such as, for
example, ANK3 for bipolar disorder (Ferreira et al., 2008), GRM7
for major depression (Shyn et al., 2011), PDE4B for schizophrenia
(Kahler et al., 2010) and SHANK3 for autism (Gauthier et al.,
2009). SynaptomeDB is a database with a web front application
resource that integrates the various and complex data sources for
these synaptic genes.

3.1 Database design and features

The database is created using MySQL 5.5. The parsers are written
in perl and Bioperl (Stajich et al., 2002). The Ensembl BioMart
is also used to create some of the tables. A conceptual model of
the database is shown in Supplementary Material 3. These tables
describe fundamental information about a particular gene: name,
description, associated accession numbers, chromosome location,
function and comparative map information among other variables.
Information from Ensembl also occupies a signiﬁcant part of the
database. It is important to note that no extensive cleaning of the
data is performed during the database creation and update process.
As detailed in Supplementary Material 1, the major cleaning process
involves character screening to make sure the data is compatible for
HTML Viewing as well as database query. This allows automatic
updates and eliminates some well-known problems created by data
cleaning.

3.2 Web interface

SynaptomeDB provides a user-friendly web interface. Users can
query SynaptomeDB using gene information such as names, gene
IDs, synonyms and genomic regions. The output consists of a
graphical representation of protein structure from PDB (Berman
et al., 2000), protein—protein interactions from STRING (von
Mering et al., 2003) and protein domain architecture from HPRD
(Keshava et al., 2009). All information was hyperlinked to its
original resources. SynaptomeDB allows the user to export multiple
samples from different sample sets, in a desired order, to a number
of common ﬁle formats including Excel, Word, CSV and XML.
The web interface of SynaptomeDB provides a rich set of functions
for searching the database. In general, search results are initially
presented as the summary statements of individual gene records
contained in SynaptomeDB, along with additional links to the gene
detail page that reveal all details of the gene records returned
by the query. A simple text search function is also provided to
enable maximum ﬂexibility in searching all records. The advanced
search page provides complex searching functions. General database

statistics are shown on the home page and reveal a quick summary
of genes, as well as the last updates of the system.

4 FUTURE PLANS AND CONCLUSIONS

The database was constructed following guideline described
previously (Kirov et al., 2005). It can be used to answer complex
queries, such as deﬁning a set of candidate genes based on the
genome localization or speciﬁc function. The database provides
a valuable resource to both experimental and bioinformatics
groups by bringing together different sources of information and
functional annotation in one place, and in a high-throughput fashion.
A synaptome-based strategy for psychiatric genetic sequencing is
valuable because there is evidence for synaptic proteins playing a
role in psychiatric disorders (Glessner et al., 2010), and because
these proteins represent the most ‘druggable’ targets for pursuit
of novel therapies. Our application will further research in this
area both in its current form and with additional modiﬁcations that
will include incorporating navigation based on GO and functional
pathways and networks among the Synaptome genes in the DB and
to also include or link with protein—protein interactions. We intend
to extend SynaptomeDB to connect to other psychiatric resources
such as SZGene (Allen et al., 2008) and Alzgene (Bertram et al.,
2007), and also to integrate variants from several ongoing studies
that include synaptome genes, including the 1000 Genomes Project.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Spoligotyping is a well-established genotyping technique
based on the presence of unique DNA sequences in Mycobacterium
tuberculosis (Mtb), the causal agent of tuberculosis disease (TB).
Although advances in sequencing technologies are leading to
whole-genome bacterial characterization, tens of thousands of isolates
have been spoligotyped, giving a global view of Mtb strain diversity. To
bridge the gap, we have developed SpolPred, a software to predict the
spoligotype from raw sequence reads. Our approach is compared with
experimentally and de novo assembly determined strain types in a set
of 44 Mtb isolates. In silica and experimental results are identical for
almost all isolates (39/44). However, SpolPred detected five experi-
mentally false spoligotypes and was more accurate and faster than
the assembling strategy. Application of SpolPred to an additional
seven isolates with no laboratory data led to types that clustered
with identical experimental types in a phylogenetic analysis using
single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Our results demonstrate the useful-
ness of the tool and its role in revealing experimental limitations.

able from www.pathogenseq.org/spolpred.

1 INTRODUCTION

Tuberculosis is an infectious disease caused by bacterium of the
M ycobacterium tuberculosis (M tb) complex. Genotyping tech-
niques based on the presence of repetitive elements, conserved
sequences, or loci with variable numbers of tandem repeats have
been standardized (Kanduma et al., 2003), allowing the compari-
son of isolates between laboratories and regions worldwide. The
popular Spoligotyping approach (Kamerbeek et al., 1997) ex-
ploits the polymorphism at the direct repeat (DR) locus of
M tb. It is based on the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampli-
ﬁcation of 43 short unique sequences (termed spacers) found
between well-conserved 36-bp DRs and the subsequent

hybridization of the products onto a membrane with oligo-
nucleotides complementary to each spacer. Since strains vary in
the occurrence of particular spacers, each sample produces a
distinctive spot pattern, which is then translated into a numerical
code of 15 digits known as octal code (Dale et al., 2001). The
web-based database SITVITWEB contains 2740 shared types or
spoligotype international types (SITs) found among 58 180 clin-
ical isolates, subsequently grouped into a list of 62 lineages/sub-
lineages which normally show a geographic distribution (Demay
et al., 2012). In silico genotyping approaches are required to
bridge the gap between experimental and high-throughput
sequencing, leading to the development of SpolPred, a software
to predict the spoligotype from raw sequence reads.

2 METHODS

We have developed a C executable to predict the spoligotype octal code
from ﬁles of fastq format. By making use of a 2-bit per nucleotide coding
strategy to speed up performance, every 25-bp unique spacer is queried
against each read allowing up to one mismatch (Ioerger et al., 2009). The
spacer sequences chosen are the same as those used as probes in the
original Spoligotyping assay (Kamerbeek et al., 1997). The read length
can be changed to support data from different (single or paired end,
minimum 35 bp) sequencing platforms (see User Manual for more avail-
able options). The appearance of all 43 queries is eventually translated
into the octal code which is then matched to a spoligotype in
SITVITWEB. The software has been applied to 51 Ugandan M tb isolates
which underwent sequencing using Illumina—GAII 76-bp paired end tech-
nology at the Sanger Institute. The number of paired reads varied per
sample from 10 to 30 million. To evaluate accuracy, Spolpred—predicted
results were compared with those experimentally determined for 44 sam-
ples in our laboratory. In addition, results were compared with those
manually extracted from de novo genome assemblies, generated using
Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) [default settings, except 51k-mer
word length, insert length (300 bp) and its standard deviation (30 bp)].
Subsequently, the same 25-bp spacers were queried against the resulting
contigs. A cluster dendogram was constructed using 6998 single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to allow the investigation of seven
isolates with no experimental data.

3 RESULTS

The software was tested on a 64-bit Ubuntu Linux computer
with a 3.07GHz processor and 8GB of RAM. As expected,
running time per fastq ﬁle increased proportionally with read

coverage. Nevertheless, processed reads per unit of time re-
mained constant (~500 000 reads per minute). SpolPred-inferred
SIT numbers matched the experimental ones for 39 samples
(88.6%). The resulting octal codes from both in silica approaches
were identical for 42 (95.5%) of the 44 samples with experimental
results (see Supplementary Table S1 for detailed results). In the
remaining two isolates, de novo assembly failed to detect spacer
25, which happens to fall between contiguous assembled contigs.
The overall ﬁve non-matched in silica and experiment results
were due to the increased in silica sensitivity of the detection of
spacer 15 in the ﬁve samples and, additionally, spacer 26 in one
sample. When the original hybridization blots were checked, an
irregular signal distribution for spacer 15 across all samples was
noted. Some signals were either too faint or just not detectable to
be manually assigned as being present. Although predicted spo-
ligotypes remained unchanged for samples 26 and 48, the other
three (25, 40 and 49), which had octal codes not previously
reported in the SITVITWEB database, were re-assigned to dif-
ferent spoligotypes. Interestingly, these three isolates are consist-
ently clustered in the SNP-based dendogram, i.e. within a clade
of samples having the same experimental type. Similarly, all sam-
ples with no laboratory data were clustered with isolates of the
same predicted spoligotype (Fig. 1).

4 DISCUSSION

Although SNPs and other genetic variation derived from sequen-
cing projects are likely to become the markers of choice due to
their discriminatory power, PCR genotyping techniques are still
widely employed. In this regard, SpolPred will enable the com-
plementary comparison of computationally inferred spoligotypes
with laboratory results. Currently, the tedious parameter opti-
mization and computational requirements for de novo assembly
are important constraints. Only 42 (95.5%) spoligotypes could
be accurately inferred using the de novo strategy implemented.
The region in the DR locus harbouring spacer 25 does not seem
to be reconstructed in two genomes, resulting in an incorrect type
classiﬁcation. Importantly, in those ﬁve samples for which
SpolPred and experimental patterns differ, predicted octal
codes were exactly the same when using both computational
approaches. Furthermore, the newly assigned spoligotypes
(namely, isolates 25, 40 and 49 in Fig. 1) are clustered with
other isolates having coincident experimental and in silica pre-
dicted lineages. The absent sequence responsible for the discre-
pancies observed, namely, spacer 15, was the same across all ﬁve
problematic isolates. The ambiguous distinction of this spacer
has been reported (Abadia et al., 2011) and explained in terms
of the presence of a 4-nt deletion adjacent to the ampliﬁed se-
quence (van Embden et al., 2000), which would not allow a
proper primer hybridization. Other ambiguities caused by the
insertion of IS6110 copies in the DR region have also been re-
ported (Filliol et al., 2000). As demonstrated, the software can be
employed to accurately and quickly conﬁrm experimentally
determined spoligotypes, infer them from sequenced isolates
with no laboratory data and reveal unexpected cases of wrongly
assigned types. Other causes of TB misclassiﬁcation such as la-
boratory cross contamination, PCR contamination or ambigu-
ous hybridization patterns could also be clariﬁed. With the
amount of sequence data increasingly growing, software like
SpolPred will be useful additions to pipelines used to infer TB

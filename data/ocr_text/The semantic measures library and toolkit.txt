ABSTRACT

Summary: The semantic measures library and toolkit are robust
open-source and easy to use software solutions dedicated to seman-
tic measures. They can be used for large-scale computations and
analyses of semantic similarities between terms/concepts defined in
terminologies and ontologies. The comparison of entities (e.g. genes)
annotated by concepts is also supported. A large collection of meas-
ures is available. Not limited to a specific application context, the
library and the toolkit can be used with various controlled vocabularies
and ontology speciﬁcations (e.g. Open Biomedical Ontology,
Resource Description Framework). The project targets both designers
and practitioners of semantic measures providing a JAVA library, as
well as a command-line tool that can be used on personal computers
or computer clusters.

Availability and implementation: Downloads, documentation,
tutorials, evaluation and support are available at http://www.seman-
tic-measures—library.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biomedical ontologies provide well-structured and controlled
vocabularies of speciﬁc domains, e. g. biological processes and
clinical healthcare terminology. They are increasingly used to
drive data integration, information retrieval, data annotations
and decision support, to cite a few (Stevens et al., 2000).Open
repositories such as the Open Biomedical Ontology (OBO)
Foundry or BioPortal (Smith et al., 2007; Whetzel et al., 2011)
provide access to hundreds of biomedical ontologies expressed in
various formats, e.g. Resource Description Framework (RDF),
OBO, Web Ontology Language (OWL). These structured
vocabularies are used to characterize entities through conceptual
annotations. For instance, genes (products) can be annotated by
Gene Ontology (GO) terms to deﬁne their molecular functions,
their cellular locations or the biological processes in which they
are involved (Ashburner et al., 2000). Those unambiguous anno-
tations can, therefore, be used to query large collections of data
taking into account the knowledge deﬁned in the ontology, i.e.
practitioners searching for genes annotated to ‘nucleoside bind-
ing’ will also retrieve genes annotated to ‘ATP binding’, as
the ontology speciﬁes that ‘ATP binding’ is a speciﬁc type of
‘nucleoside binding’. However, in some cases, exact searches

are too constraining, and we search for entities that are similar
or related to the query. Such an imprecise search is based on
information retrieval techniques that require a function to esti-
mate whether or not two entities are similar or related with
regards to their conceptual annotations. Therefore, to exploit
ontologies and corresponding annotations, semantic measures
are required. They aim to compare concepts by taking into
account the semantic space in which they are deﬁned. They
can, therefore, be used to assess the degree of likeness of concepts
deﬁned in ontologies or between entities annotated by those con-
cepts (Pesquita et al., 2009).

An increasing number of algorithms rely on semantic meas-
ures, for instance to analyze genes based on their molecular func-
tions (Sy et al., 2012) or related diseases (Li et al., 2011).
Semantic measures can also assist in comparisons of patient
records, chemical compounds, diseases or any entity that can
be characterized by unambiguous terms or concepts deﬁned in
ontologies or thesauri.

Numerous communities are involved in the study of semantic
measures (e.g. bioinformatics, Natural Language Processing,
artiﬁcial intelligence and Semantic Web). Owing to their
popularity, many measures have been designed for different
ontologies and treatments (e. g. gene analysis, information re-
trieval): a recent survey distinguished tens of measures dedicated
to the GO alone (Guzzi et al., 2012). However, communities
focusing on other types of annotated entities (e. g. patient
records) also beneﬁt theoretical ﬁndings made by studying meas-
ures in other speciﬁc domains such as molecular biology and vice
versa. Nevertheless, most software solutions related to semantic
measures are developed for a speciﬁc terminology/ontology and
only focus on a limited set of measures (Frohlich et al., 2007; Li
et al., 2011; McInnes et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2010). To federate
efforts related to the design and analysis of semantic measures
and to respond to the need for a generic software tool dedicated
to them, we developed the semantic measures library (SML).
This article presents its beneﬁts for the computation of semantic
measures using bio-ontologies.

2 THE SML AND TOOLKIT

The SML is an extensive, efﬁcient and generic open-source
library dedicated to the computation, development and analysis
of semantic measures. Numerous functionalities provided by the
SML are also available within the SML-Toolkit, a command-line
program that can be used by non-developers to easily compute
semantic measures on personal computers or computer clusters.
The SML and the toolkit are distributed under the open-source

Semantic Measures Library and toolkit

 

CeCILL license (compatible with the widely used GNU General
Public License).

The SML uses cross-platform JAVA programing language
version 1.7, which is available for most operating systems.
It can be used to compute semantic similarities of concepts/
terms deﬁned in structured terminologies and ontologies. It can
also be used to assess the semantic similarity of pairs of entities
annotated by concepts, e. g. patient records annotated by groups
of concepts, genes annotated by GO terms, PubMed articles
annotated by MeSH descriptors. Considering a pair of terms/
entities, the library computes a similarity score. Developers
can, therefore, easily embed source code referring to the library
to compute measures in their own algorithms and applications.

The library supports various ontology formats and speciﬁca-
tions (e. g. OBO, RDF, OWL). Speciﬁc ontology loaders are also
provided to handle widely used biomedical terminologies such as
MeSH and SNOMED Clinical Terms (SNOMED CT). Custom
knowledge representation loaders can also be added to the SML.
In addition, low-level access to the library enables developers to
ﬁnely control the underlying graph model (ontology) to apply
speciﬁc treatments sometimes required for the computation of
semantic measures (e.g. transitive reduction to remove taxonom-
ical redundancies).

A large collection of semantic measures is provided out-of-the-
box—version 0.7 supports about 50 measures relying on different
strategies. Thanks to the ﬁne-grained control provided by the
library, this leads to about 1500 speciﬁc measure conﬁgurations
that can be speciﬁed for context-speciﬁc applications. In add-
ition, the algorithms developed in the SML provide the designers
of semantic measures an extensive Application Programming
Interface and framework to easily develop, test and evaluate
new measures. Moreover, because of its generic underlying
graph data model, semantic measures developed using the
SML will beneﬁt a large audience. Those measures are not
restricted to a speciﬁc ontology, which is the case with existing
software solutions, and can, therefore, be used with the
various knowledge representations supported by the library.
Furthermore, the SML relies on a graph model compatible
with the Linked Data paradigm. This enables SML users to
take advantage of the growing number of datasets published
according to Linked Data and Semantic Web visions, e.g. see
Bio2RDF initiative (Belleau et al., 2008).

The SML enables large-scale computations and analyses of
semantic measures. It supports multi-threaded processes for
fast parallel computation on multicore processors. Table 1
presents a running time comparison between three libraries dedi-
cated to the GO and the SML (detailed protocol, associated
source code and additional evaluations are provided at http://
www.semantic-measures-library.com/sml/performance).

Based on the SML, an open-source toolkit enables non-
developers to beneﬁt from functionalities provided by the library
through easy to use command-line software. The SML-Toolkit is
highly tuneable and enables context-speciﬁc conﬁgurations to be
speciﬁed depending on the experiment performed: knowledge
base to use (ontologies, annotations), required data preprocess-
ing (e.g. the removal of taxonomic redundancies), measure
constraints (e. g. algorithmic complexity, information to take
into account), set of queries to perform (i.e. concept or entity
identiﬁers) and other (optional) parameters (e.g. output ﬁle,

computer resources allocated). Detailed conﬁgurations can be
speciﬁed using an extensible mark-up language ﬁle. Speciﬁc com-
mand-line interfaces, called proﬁles, are also developed to ease
the use of the SML-Toolkit in speciﬁc use cases, e. g. to estimate
the similarity of genes regarding their GO term annotations.
Such proﬁles can be used to hide the advanced capabilities of
the library, and therefore improve the experience for users inter-
ested only in computing semantic measures in a speciﬁc context
of use (e.g. gene or disease analysis). Related source code and
issue trackers are available from the public dedicated repository.
Community support is also provided to facilitate usage and
ensure improvements of both the library and the toolkit.

Open source, generic, efﬁcient and highly tuneable, the SML
and the toolkit are not limited to a speciﬁc ontology and can,
therefore, be used in a broad ﬁeld of application, (scientiﬁc)
projects and software solutions [e.g. Harispe et al. (2013), Sy
et al. (2012)].

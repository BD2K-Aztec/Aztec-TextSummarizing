ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein movements form a continuum from large domain
rearrangements (including folding and restructuring) to side-chain
rotamer changes and small rearrangements. Understanding side-
chain flexibility upon binding is important to understand molecular
recognition events and predict ligand binding.

Methods: In the present work, we developed a well-curated non-
redundant dataset of 188 proteins in pairs of structures in the Apo
(unbound) and Holo (bound) forms to study the extent and the factors
that guide side-chain rotamer changes upon binding.

Results: Our analysis shows that side-chain rotamer changes
are widespread with only 10% of binding sites displaying no
conformational changes. Overall, at most five rotamer changes
account for the observed movements in 90% of the cases.
Furthermore, rotamer changes are essential in 32% of flexible
binding sites. The different amino acids have a 11-fold difference
in their probability to undergo changes. Side-chain flexibility
represents an intrinsic property of amino acids as it correlates well
with configurational entropy differences. Furthermore, on average
b-factors and solvent accessible surface areas can discriminate
flexible side-chains in the Apo form. Finally, there is a rearrangement
of the hydrogen-bonding network upon binding primarily with a loss
of H-bonds with water molecules and a gain of H-bonds with protein
residues for flexible residues. Interestingly, only 25% of side chains
capable of forming H-bonds do so with the ligand upon binding.
In terms of drug design, this last result shows that there is a large
number of potential interactions that may be exploited to modulate
the specificity and sensitivity of inhibitors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Proteins bind small molecules as substrates, cofactors and allosteric
regulators in order to perform essential cellular functions. As
a consequence of induced ﬁt (Koshland, 1958), conformational
selection (Rubin and Changeux, 1966) or more likely a combination
of both (Csermely et al., 2010), the ligand—bound protein may
display a wide gamut of structural changes. These changes can
range from large movements of entire domains to small side—chain
rearrangements in the binding site.

It is widely accepted that ﬂexibility is essential for protein function
(Chothia et al., 1983; Lesk and Chothia, 1984). Studying dynamic
aspects of protein structure using nuclear magnetic resonance

spectroscopy, for example, is still sufﬁciently costly and time
consuming as to prevent its use in the same scale as X—ray
crystallography. X—ray crystallography produces a ‘snapshot’ of
a protein that offers little information on dynamic aspects of
structure. However, it is possible to compare different ‘snapshots’
to infer dynamic properties of the protein. For example, one can
compare two structures of the same protein crystalized in different
conditions, say in the bound (H010) and unbound (Apo) forms.
Although this type of comparison is neutral with respect to the
mechanism of binding (induced—ﬁt or conformational selection),
it makes possible, given the amount of available data, to perform
statistically signiﬁcant large—scale studies of conformational changes
associated to ligand binding.

Understanding the factors that affect protein ﬂexibility has
important practical applications, as efforts in trying to simulate
ﬂexibility (even restricted to side—chain movements) have been
limited so far by the drastic increase in the size of the associated
conformational search space. For example, docking algorithms are
an example in which the ﬂexibility of the protein can have a
drastic impact on the results. As such, any knowledge that can be
applied to decrease in a sensible way the size of the search space is
advantageous.

Our earlier study (Najmanovich et al., 2000), among the ﬁrst
statistical studies of side—chain ﬂexibility upon ligand binding,
uncovered general features regarding side—chain rearrangements. We
used a dataset of paired X—ray structures of the same protein in
bound and unbound forms comprising 353 complexes representing
153 different proteins. We used a 60° dihedral angle difference
threshold to denote the occurrence of conformational changes. Using
this deﬁnition, we showed that up to three ﬂexible residues account
for the conformational changes observed in 85% of all binding—
sites studied and that different amino acid types have different
probabilities to be observed in conformationally different states upon
binding.

More recently, a study revisited the question of side—chain
ﬂexibility upon binding measuring Cartesian coordinate differences
(Gutteridge and Thornton, 2005) using an ensemble of 60
complexes. The authors measured root mean square differences
(RMSD) of Cartesian coordinates between atoms in the Apo form
and those in the Holo form bound to all ligands necessary for the
reaction at hand. For example, if an enzyme requires a cofactor
or multiple substrates, the Holo form used for comparisons was
that containing all such ligands present. The authors calculated the
RMSD between: (i) all atoms in the superimposed structures; (ii)
atoms belonging to residues that bind the ligands or (iii) those
implicated in catalysis. As a control, the authors calculated the
RMSD between pairs of different Apo form structures of the same

proteins. On the basis of histograms of such RMSD distributions, the
authors conclude that conformational changes on substrate binding
can be quite subtle (RMSD < 1 A) and that such movements are
of the same magnitude as those observed between Apo forms. As
recognized by the authors, the RMSD is a problematic quantity
when detecting local movements, as the RMSD is a global quantity
that measures an average over all residues/atoms considered. For
the same reason, RMSD distributions for sets containing largely
different numbers of atoms should not be compared (such as binding
site and catalytic site residue sets). Interestingly, the authors suggest
that catalytic residues are more rigid than binding site (non—catalytic)
residues. However, the use of the global RMSD as a measure of
ﬂexibility makes it difﬁcult to judge the extent of local movements
taking place.

Using an indirect approach, a study explored side—chain
movements upon binding using success in ﬂexible docking
simulations to evaluate the extent of movements required upon
binding to accommodate ligands within 2.5 A of the observed
crystallographic solution (Zavodszky and Kuhn, 2005). On the basis
of the docking results obtained using a dataset of 63 complexes
representing 20 different proteins, the authors proposed the minimal
rotation hypothesis. This hypothesis states that protein side—chains
move as little as necessary in order to accommodate ligand binding,
i.e. involving mostly modest changes of less than 15°. Two caveats
in this study may limit the extent of their conclusions. First, the
small number of unique proteins studied. Second, and perhaps more
important, the fact that the authors use success in detecting a docked
conformation of the ligand (in the presence of side—chain ﬂexibility)
within 2.5 A of the crystallographic solution as a measure of the
importance of ﬂexibility upon binding. It is unclear if dihedral
angle changes of < 15° would sufﬁce to accommodate the ligands in
their precise experimentally observed positions with less permissive
RMSD than the 2.5 A used. Therefore, while the minimal rotation
hypothesis may be a useful approximation in docking simulations
if validated in a larger dataset, it still remains to be seen if it is
applicable to explain side—chain ﬂexibility upon binding.

Our earlier study (Najmanovich et al., 2000) was based on
dihedral angle differences. However, such a measurement is in
fact a surrogate measure, a more direct measurement of side—
chain conformational changes that is more properly anchored on
thermodynamic principles is required to measure the extent with
which true side—chain conformational changes are observed as a
result of ligand binding. This is particularly important in light of the
results of the articles discussed above (Gutteridge and Thornton,
2005; Zavodszky and Kuhn, 2005) suggesting that small—scale
changes are sufﬁcient to account for side—chain ﬂexibility in ligand
binding.

Side—chain rotamers are deﬁned as particular combination of side—
chain dihedral angle ranges. Average dihedral angle combinations of
frequently observed conformations represent energetically favorable
states. The classiﬁcation of side chains into rotamers using side—
chain rotamer libraries (Dunbrack and Cohen, 1997) makes it
possible to determine the extent of side—chain conformational
transitions between energetically distinct states as a result of ligand
binding. Such libraries also tabulate the probability with which
different rotamers are observed. Therefore, in principle rotamer
libraries can also help decrease conformational search space with
the use of rotamers as representative conformations of energetically
favorable states.

The amino acids observed in any particular protein—binding site
are the result of natural selection fulﬁlling a myriad of constraints.
These include structural constraints in terms of the geometry of the
binding site and particularly of catalytic residues as well as physico—
chemical constraints related to binding. The evolutionary selection
of binding site amino acids involved in binding is due in part also to
the ﬂexibility of side chains as it impacts the speciﬁcity with respect
to the natural (cognate) ligands as well as the selectivity of the
binding site in terms of preventing the binding of competing ligands
within the cellular milieu (Naj manovich et al., 2008). Therefore, the
conformational changes observed when studying the binding of non—
cognate ligands might not necessarily be equivalent to those seen
with cognate ligands. Therefore, in order to draw conclusions about
the extent of side—chain ﬂexibility upon binding one has to restrict
the analysis to proteins bound to cognate or near cognate ligands. As
protein—ligand complexes present in the protein databank (Berman
et al., 2007, 2000) contain both cognate and non—cognate ligands, it
is important to consider this factor when selecting a dataset (Bashton
et al., 2007). None of the previous studies mentioned above, with the
exception to some extent of the work by Gutteridge and Thornton
(2005), takes this factor in consideration.

In order to clarify the extent of side—chain ﬂexibility observed
upon ligand binding, it is necessary to perform an analysis using
a non—redundant dataset of protein cognate—ligand pairs as large as
possible to increase the statistical signiﬁcance of the results. Such an
analysis must also be based on the detection of side—chain rotamer
transitions as a way to assure that observed conformational changes
involve the transition across energetic barriers.

In this study, we built a curated non—redundant dataset of pairs
of X—ray protein structures, representing the cognate—ligand bound
(H010) and unbound (Apo) forms of the same protein, in order to
study multiple aspects of side—chain ﬂexibility upon ligand binding.
The curation involves the ﬁltering or correction of potential factors
(such as the assignment of atoms during reﬁnement) affecting the
quality of the structures. The steps involved in creating a non—
redundant dataset assure that our conclusions are not biased by
over—representation of particular proteins or small samples. The non—
redundant dataset created as part of this work could be used as
a docking benchmark dataset particularly when the effect of side—
chain ﬂexibility needs to be taken in consideration in the analysis of
the performance of docking algorithms.

We study many aspects of side—chain ﬂexibility by addressing the
following questions: (i) What fraction of binding—sites undergoes
change upon binding? (ii) To what extent are these movements
critical for binding? (iii) How ﬂexible are the individual amino
acid side—chains? and (iv) Is the observed ﬂexibility of side chains
characteristic of the binding site environment or reﬂect intrinsic
properties of the amino acids?

2 METHODS

2.1 Deﬁnition of database entries

In this study, we only use X—ray protein structures from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB) release of October 2010. Since lower resolution structures (above 3.0
A resolution) raise the level of uncertainty in the assignment of side—chain
conformations, only structures with resolution better or equal to 2.50 A are
used for this study.

An entry in the database consists of a pair of structures of a given protein
and a particular ligand that is bound to one of the structures, the H010 form for

Side-chain rotamer changes upon ligand binding

 

that ligand, while the second protein structure of the same protein represents
the Apo form with respect to that ligand. The sequences of the H010 and
Apo forms must be identical (100% sequence identity) over at least 80%
of the length of either (overlap). These criteria allow us to detect different
structures of the same protein in cases where there are small differences in
the N and C termini of the proteins, such as when a particular domain of a
multi—domain protein is cloned separately and different groups may choose
slightly different domain boundaries or the presence of His—tags or other
sequences required for puriﬁcation.

Our objective in this study is to observe side—chain conformational
changes associated to ligand binding. To maximize the chances that
the binding ligand is the only factor affecting the observed side—chain
conformational changes, in this study we restrict our analysis to pairs of
structures which differ by the presence of one ligand and thus are deﬁned as
Apo and H010 forms for that ligand. The Apo and H010 forms may be bound
to other ligands, as long as such ligands are present in both structures and
make the equivalent contacts with the protein. Speciﬁcally, we remove cases
where such extra ligands have more than 10 different contacts in the Apo
and H010 forms.

One problem when working with X—ray structures is that sometimes one
or more atoms or entire residues could not be resolved due to uncertainty
of atom positioning caused by high movements in the crystal. PDB entries
missing any binding site side—chain atoms were removed.

2.2 Correction of atom assignments

We ﬁlter the dataset to distinguish certain potential artifacts in the assignment
of atoms during reﬁnement. The assignment of nitrogen and oxygen atoms
in electron—density maps is very challenging due their similarities. In
many cases it is not possible except at extremely high resolution or when
surrounding atoms help distinguish hydrogen bond donor and acceptor N— or
O—containing groups. When the two atoms cannot be distinguished, the
outermost dihedral angle may be uncertain by 1800 in the cases of Asn and
Gln. An analysis of a dataset of highly resolved structures showed that Asn
and Gln amides needed to be ﬂipped in 20% of cases (Word et 01., 1999). In
the context of studying side—chain rearrangements with rotamers that have
predeﬁned dihedral angles, erroneous atom assignments may lead to errors in
the measurement of the frequency of side—chain rotamer changes. Although
high—resolution structures (~1 A) are unlikely to contain mis—assignments, it
would impossible to generate a dataset sufﬁciently large to derive statistically
signiﬁcant conclusions. In the present work, we ensure atoms are correctly
assigned and correct assignments when necessary.

Correcting erroneous atom assignments requires the analysis of hydrogen
bonding interactions. We do so by using the program REDUCE that adds
hydrogen atoms in standard geometry in order to satisfy physico—chemical
constraints (Word et al., 1999). In agreement with the previous study,
approximately one—ﬁfth of binding site residues (17% for Asn, 16% for
His and 20% for Gln) required a ﬂip in order to avoid the amide clashing
with neighboring atoms (Word et al., 1999). Moreover, we remove hydrogen
atoms from phosphates and carboxylic groups, as they are more likely to be
deprotonated in physiological conditions. In the case of ligands, the HET
dictionary provided by the PDB is used to retrieve connectivity information.

2.3 Selection of ligands and deﬁnition of binding sites

For simplicity, our analysis is restricted to ligands that appear as HETATM
in PDB records and otherwise excludes nucleic acids or peptides as the
focus of this study lies on the interactions between small molecules and
proteins. Furthermore, as we are interested in speciﬁc interactions of cognate
ligands with binding sites that evolved to bind such molecules, the most
common molecules found in crystallization buffers are also excluded from
our analysis. Such molecules do not play any role in protein function in
the majority of cases and comprise sulphates (S04), phosphates (P04),
glycerol (GOL), ammonium (NH4), citric acid (CIT), (4s)—2—methyl—2,4—
pentanediol (MPD), 2—amino—2—hydroxymethyl—propane—1,3—diol (TRS) and

2—(N—morpholino)—ethanesulphonic acid (MES). Although water molecules
do play a major role in catalysis, their implication in binding has been
studied in detail elsewhere (Barillari et 01., 2007; Levy and Onuchic, 2006)
and are not considered as ligands in the present work. Finally, covalently
bound ligands are discarded, as we are interested exclusively in side—chain
movements upon binding as a result of non—bonded interactions.

A few ﬁlters are applied to decrease the number of cases involving non—
speciﬁc binding such as imposing a minimum number of ligand—protein
contacts and number atoms in the ligand. The reason for the latter is that
very small ligands (ﬁve atoms or less) only make a few key interactions with
the protein and can bind non—speciﬁcally. Moreover, one issue when working
with PDB ﬁles is that they contain the coordinates of the asymmetric unit,
which does not necessarily represent the biological unit of the protein. To
circumvent this potential source of errors when using asymmetric units, we
only retain ligands that are buried into a protein cavity belonging to a single
polypeptidic chain. The fraction of ligand area in contact FC 2 SASb/SASf
is used to quantify the degree of burial of a ligand, in which we compare
the solvent accessible surface (SAS) of the free ligand (SASf) to the bound
ligand form (SASb) in the same ligand conformation. The minimum allowed
fraction of ligand area in contact is 0.70.

The binding pocket is deﬁned as the set of residues with at least one atom
with surface area in contact with an atom of the ligand. Surfaces in contact
between atoms as well as SAS are calculated using a Voronoi Polyhedra
analytical algorithm (McConkey et 01., 2002) using standard van der Waals
radii used for the protein and the ligand atoms as described elsewhere (Tsai
et 01., 1999). To ensure ligands are speciﬁcally bound to the protein, ligands
must contain a minimum of ﬁve non—hydrogen atoms and to be in contact
with at least ﬁve residues in the protein.

2.4 Generating non-redundant subsets

Using the ﬁlters and parameters described in the preceding paragraphs, we
obtain a redundant dataset that we call the PRIMARY (PRI) database. Non—
redundant subsets are derived from the PRI dataset.

Our objective in developing non—redundant datasets is that every ligand
and protein domain combination is represented equally. To do so, ligands are
associated to a Pfam domain (Punta et al., 2011) based on the protein domains
with which they interact using the PROCOGNATE v.1.6 database (Bashton
et 01., 2007). In cases where domain assignments for a given complex are not
available in PROCOGNATE, a domain is manually assigned by searching the
protein sequence using Hidden Markov Models (HMM) against the HMM
Pfam library A using HMMer (Finn et 61]., 2011). Similar to PROCOGNATE,
if at least 75% of the total number of contacts of a molecule occur with atoms
belonging to a particular Pfam domain, its binding is assigned to that domain.
In cases where a molecule has contacts with multiple domains and none has at
least 75% of the total contacts, all domains in contact are assigned, leading to
multiple entries. The ﬁrst non—redundant dataset is called PFAM and contains
one entry for each different ligand/Pfam domain combination. Different
entries could be chosen as a representative for a given ligand/Pfam domain
combination. For example, two different human protein kinases bound to
ATP and compared to their respective Apo forms could be present in the
PRI dataset. In the PFAM dataset, only one representative is retained. The
representative Pfam/ligand combination is chosen according to the largest
fraction of ligand area in contact (RC).

One problem with the non—redundant PFAM dataset is that the same or
different proteins representing the same Pfam domain and bound to different
ligands appear as different entries in the database. To remove this source
of redundancy with respect to protein sequences, a more stringent dataset
called SEQ was derived from the PFAM dataset. In the SEQ dataset, only
entries with protein sequence identity below 50% for a given Pfam domain
are retained. As before, the choice between different entries is made based on
RC. Supplementary Figure S1 shows the relationship between the PFAM and
SEQ datasets. In this case, one is ultimately loosing some bona ﬁde entries
by choosing a representative entry among many containing different ligands.

2.5 Side-chain rearrangement analysis

Throughout this study, the Penultimate backbone—independent rotamer
library is used as reference for rotamer assignment (Lovell et al., 2000). We
use similar ﬁlters as the Penultimate backbone—independent rotamer library to
ﬁlter out low—quality non—rotameric (NR) side—chain conformations. Namely,
we eliminate NR side Chains with any heavy atom having either an absolute
B—factor > 40, an occupancy < 1.0 or containing an alternative conformation.

We use a rotamer—based approach assuming that residues observed
in different rotameric states point to conformational states separated by
energetic barriers. Residues observed in different rotameric states in the
Apo and H010 forms are referred as ﬂexible throughout or rigid otherwise.
Rotamers are deﬁned as a combination of dihedral angles. We calculate
for each rotatable bond i, the dihedral angles (referred as x,- throughout),
using the same deﬁnition of atom names and X angles as the one used by
Lovell et al. (2000). A rotamer of residue type R (RROT) from the Penultimate
rotamer library is assigned to each binding—site residue (RBPK), by comparing
RBPK x,- to the corresponding RROT Xi. A rotamer is excluded when RBPK
X,- is not within the range RROT Xi:l: 30° (unless a speciﬁc range is deﬁned
for the particular rotamer in the library). After excluding all rotamers that
are not applicable, the remaining rotamer is the one to be assigned. In cases
where all rotamers are excluded, the side chain is assigned as NR. Cases for
which the bound and unbound rotamers are assigned to NR are removed,
as it is difﬁcult to judge if the potential side—chain movements represent
energetically separate states.

The probability of a residue type i to undergo side—chain conformational
changes upon ligand binding (Pi) is calculated as previously described
(Najmanovich et 01., 2000) as follows:

P N’Rj: (NIB (1)
 —Ta
Ni Ni

where N? is the total number of cases in which the rotamers differ and NiT
is the total number of residues of type i in all binding sites. The second term
is the error estimation involved in the measurement.

In some cases, the binding of a ligand can lead to major conformational
changes, resulting in signiﬁcant different protein conformations. In order
to simplify our analysis, we choose to limit our study to cases where the
average backbone displacement of the binding site is below 2.50 A (RMSD).
Although this threshold may seem a bit permissive, we ﬁnd that such a
threshold offers an acceptable balance as a more stringent threshold leads to
a signiﬁcant loss of data.

2.6 Physical constraints analysis

Steric clashes are quantiﬁed using a potential (WALL) after superimposition
of the H010 and Apo structures. This allows us to judge if the Holo ligand pose
would be acceptable in the Apo form (referred as Apo—bound throughput) in
spite of side—chain rotameric changes. The potential is described as follows:

N N 1 12 1 12
WALLszalleZ|:(—) —(r.+rl)  (2)
l J

r..
i=1 j=1 ’1

 

where Kwau is a penalty constant of value 106 i is the Nth ligand atom; j the
M th protein atom; rl-j the distance between atoms i and j and r,- and rj the
van der Waals radii. The greater the potential is, the more clashes there are.
The potential is similar to that previously described by Sobolev et al. (1996),
developed to prevent steric clashes in docking simulations. We calculate the
differences in WALL term from the H010 to Apo forms. A threshold value is
empirically set upon visual inspection of Apo—bound forms to a value of 150
for all ligand—protein contacts, above which the ligand pose in the Apo form
is no longer acceptable. This positive value accounts for slight inaccuracies
in the radii of ligand atoms. A threshold of 25 is used when considering steric
clashes for individual side—Chain atoms.

2.7 Hydrogen bonding network analysis

Hydrogen bonding is a directional interaction in which an Acceptor ‘A’ shares
electrons with an hydrogen bound to a Donor ‘D’ (commonly referred as
D—H  A). In this study, only strong hydrogen bonding with side chains are
considered, i.e. cases where both donor and acceptor are oxygen or nitrogen
atoms. Thus, in our study, only the following residues are considered: Arg,
Asn, Asp, Gln, Glu, His, Lys, Ser, Trp and Tyr. Considering the prevalence
of multifurcation in hydrogen bonding (Sarkhel and Desiraju, 2004), the
geometric criteria for their detection are set as dHWA 5 2.7 A (as long as
atoms were not clashing: deA 2 1.5 A) and ®D_HWA 2 90°. We calculate
the number of H—bonds formed between binding site side chains and the
following three entities: water, ligand and protein. The difference of H—bonds
between the unbound and bound forms is expressed as conserved, gain or
loss. Conserved denotes that the total number of H—bonds formed with an
entity remains the same after binding whereas a gain denotes new H—bonds
are formed after binding. If a residue does not have any H—bond in both forms,
it is assigned as conserved. As hydrogen atoms are not explicitly added to
water, those acting as donors were treated as if they could always present a
hydrogen atom in optimal geometric position.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

In this study, we generated a database that consists of pairs of
identical proteins in Holo (bound to a ligand) and Apo (unbound
to the ligand) forms to analyze side—chain ﬂexibility upon ligand
binding. Our objective is to develop a dataset where, as much as
possible, the only factor that inﬂuences ﬂexibility is the binding of
the ligand in question. The PRI database is the largest dataset that
meets our criteria and contains 1812 entries. The database comprises
1270 different crystallographic structures (average resolution of
1.93 A) deﬁning 163 protein families and 1110 different ligands
(Supplementary Table SI). For the purposes statistical analyses,
the PRI database is redundant. For example, several proteins were
crystallized multiple times under similar experimental conditions.
Furthermore, the same PDB might be considered as Holo for a given
ligand but as Apo for another ligand.

Two non—redundant subsets (PFAM and SEQ) were generated
from PRI. In PFAM, each ligand is uniquely bound to a protein
domain (Supplementary Fig. 1), in other words one entry per
domain—ligand combination. The same domain can bind different
ligands in the PFAM dataset, which can result in different binding
site conformations. This subset contains 631 entries deﬁning 884
structures bound to 631 different ligands. The PFAM subset still
contains a bias toward particular families of proteins that are over
represented in this dataset such as protein kinases (Pfam PF00069)
and trypsin (Pfam PF00089) domains, with 143 and 61 cases,
respectively, that were crystallized multiple times with distinct
ligands.

The more restrictive SEQ subset (with 188 entries) removes this
bias allowing only one representative for each group of sequences
with up to 50% sequence identity belonging to the same Pfam
domain. Thus, a protein could appear multiple times in the subset
as a result of convergent evolution or if the family diverged
sufﬁciently as to be classiﬁed into different Pfam families. For
example, the PFAM subset only contains seven protein kinase
structures, representing kinases with <50% sequence similarity.
Statistics for the SEQ subset are shown in Supplementary Table
II. Throughout the study, the SEQ subset is used. The list of entries,
residues analyzed as well as supplementary data are available at:

Number of residues undergoing change

side chains undergo conformational change in ~90% of binding—sites (inset).
Green bars/triangles show the results obtained using and angular difference
threshold of 60° as the criteria for the occurrence of conformational changes

3.1 Side-chain rotamer changes are common

We calculated the fraction of binding pockets undergoing side—chain
conformational changes. Residues undergoing changes in binding
sites are calculated using a rotamer—based approach as well as the
A X threshold of 60° used in our previous study (Naj manovich et al.,
2000). The Poisson—like distribution obtained (Fig. 1) shows that
most binding sites undergo only one rearrangement using the A X
threshold method and 1 or 2 rearrangements using the rotamer—
based method. This result differs from the asymptotically decreasing
distribution observed in our previous study (Najmanovich et al.,
2000) in which the most common case was that of binding sites with
no rearrangements between the bound and unbound forms. There
is a signiﬁcant decrease (2—fold) in the proportion of binding sites
where no rearrangements are observed (denoted as rigid henceforth)
from what was previously shown. This is particularly interesting, as
our methodology in which side chains with very large amplitudes
of movements were excluded from the dataset would shift the
distribution towards the left—hand side (Supplementary Fig. 2).
Therefore, the smaller fraction of rigid binding sites compared to the
previous study can be explained by the more stringent constraints
used to build the dataset in the current study.

Our previous study looked at each X ,- individually using different
threshold dihedral angle values of 45°, 60° and 75° and noticed
that side—chain rearrangements are largely insensitive to variation in
the threshold. Using the present dataset, we observe a shift in the
distributions using higher thresholds (Supplementary Figs 3—4). The
use of A X thresholds is based on the assumption that large angular
differences generally indicate structures belonging to different
rotamers. However, the use of ad hoc thresholds could overestimate
side—chain rearrangements when the A X threshold is too low or
underestimate the rearrangements when the threshold is too high.

The rotamer—based approach used in this study is more appropriate
as each residue has its own rotamer classiﬁcation that renders
unnecessary the use of ad hoc error—prone thresholds. We account
in part for the effect of intrinsic disorder in ﬂexibility when using

rotamers as the deﬁnition of rotamers consider variations in dihedral
angle values.

Overall, our results show that ~12% of binding sites do not
change conformation upon ligand binding. In other words, in ~88%
of the cases, at least one residue undergo changes which shows
the large amount of ﬂexibility that occurs upon ligand binding.
Thus, our results show that a signiﬁcant amount of ﬂexibility
occurs upon ligand binding when considering rotamer changes
as opposed to RMSD values (Gutteridge and Thornton, 2005).
Furthermore, such widespread rotamer transitions represent changes
between energetically separate states, thus placing doubt over the
validity of the minimal rotation hypothesis outside the context
of docking simulations and the small dataset upon which it was
developed (Zavodszky and Kuhn, 2005). Although it would be
desirable to set all residues as ﬂexible when predicting the structure
of protein, it is impractical from a computational point of view
considering the exponential increase in size of the search space.
However, considering at most ﬁve side chains as ﬂexible account
for all side—chain rotamer changes in ~90% of binding sites (inset
Fig. 1). Therefore, the introduction of side—chain ﬂexibility on a
limited number of binding site residues can be seen as a realistic
simpliﬁcation.

3.2 Side-chain ﬂexibility is crucial for binding

3.2.] Steric constraints We investigated the role of side—chain
ﬂexibility from a steric point—of—view using the WALL potential
Equation (2) in order to understand to what extent side—chain
conformational changes are essential to accommodate the ligand in
the binding site. To do so we superimpose the Apo and H010 forms
and transplant the ligand to the Apo form, what we call Apo—bound
form. We calculate the WALL difference between Apo—bound and
H010 forms for all binding sites in the SEQ database (Fig. 2).

As expected, in the subset of binding sites in which no rotamer
changes were observed, the Apo—bound and H010 forms show no
signiﬁcant differences in their steric potential for rigid binding
sites. Overall, in 32% of ﬂexible cases (28% of all binding sites),
side—chain rearrangements are required to accommodate the ligand
and to avoid steric clashes. In the context of molecular docking,
these results demonstrate the importance of considering side—chain
ﬂexibility and deﬁne a natural threshold for the accuracy of rigid
docking algorithms tested on an unbiased non—redundant dataset.

3.2.2 The minimal rotation hypothesis The rigid binding site
in Figure 2 in which there are severe clashes (the rightmost
case in green) is that of Lectin bound to N —acetyl—glucosamine
(Supplementary Fig. 5). In this case, the residue that contributes
the most to the WALL term is at 2.0 A in the Apo—bound form
but and moves just enough (0.7 A) to avoid clashing with ligand
atoms in the Holo structure. However, this small change is brought
about by a small rotation that does not represent a rotamer change.
When looking at the residue responsible for the most severe clashes
in the Apo—bound form (Supplementary Fig. 6), we observe 170
residues with critical steric clashes. Of these, 54 undergo a rotamer
change (out of 472 that undergo rotamer change) and 116 have
changes insufﬁcient to classify as a different rotamer (out of 1923
that remain rigid). Overall, only in 37 critical cases (2 ﬂexible
and 35 rigid side chains) a dihedral angle change of less than
15° is responsible for the change, in agreement with the minimal
rotation hypothesis (Zavodszky and Kuhn, 2005) distributed among
34 binding—sites (out of 188). Therefore, the minimal rotation
hypothesis is valid in 21.7% of residues critical for binding (whereas
ours is in 31.8%) corresponding to 18% of binding—sites. The
previous results illustrate the difﬁculty of introducing side—chain
ﬂexibility and that no single approach can describe all observed
changes.

3.3 Flexibility is correlated with entropy differences

In this section, we discuss particular aspects of side—chain ﬂexibility
for the different side chains. A total of 2395 residues were considered
for the statistical analysis with an average of 141 per residue. Cys
has the lowest number of observations with 42 and Leu the highest
with 234. Gly and Ala are not considered since they do not have any
dihedral bonds as well as Pro, because movement of its side—chain
inevitably causes backbone movements. Cys residues participating
in disulﬁde bonds are also excluded as their conformations are
constrained. A detailed list of the residues is accessible at our
website.

We show in Figure 3 the probability with which each residue
undergoes changes (probabilities are listed in Supplementary Table
III). In general, the probability of a residue to undergo rotamer
change upon binding increases with the number of ﬂexible bonds
(in parenthesis) in the following order: Lys(4) > Arg(4), Gln(3),
Met(3) > Asn(2) > Asp(2), Phe(2), Ser(1), Tyr(2), Glu(3) > Ile(2),
His(2), Leu(2) > Trp(2) > Val(1), Thr(1), Cys(1). There is a 11—fold
difference between the probabilities of Cys and Lys. The ﬂexibility
scale correlates with that in our previous study (Najmanovich
et al., 2000) despite the methodological differences between the
two studies and the differences in the procedure used to create a
non—redundant dataset.

Lee et al. (1994) estimated changes of side—chain conformational
entropy (AS) in folding/binding for the different amino acids placed
at the center of a nine residue a—helix. The probability proﬁles they
calculated agree with the frequencies of occurrence of the different
side—chain rotamers. The AS of Lee et al. (1994) correlates well with
our ﬂexibility scale (R—value is 0.72) apart from a few disparities
(Fig. 3, inset). The correlation observed strengthens the validity
of the ﬂexibility scale. It also suggests that the closer distance
between side chains within binding sites (due to its concavity) does
not have a major effect on the entropy of amino acids (as AS

Fig. 3. Side—chain ﬂexibility upon binding. The probabilities to undergo
rotamer change for different amino acids are shown according to amino acid
types. The probability scale correlates with entropy differences (inset)

values were calculated with residues in the surface of an exposed oz—
helix). Therefore, binding—site residues and residues exposed in the
protein surface should behave similarly with respect to ﬂexibility.
The disparities observed in the correlation could be explained by the
contribution of other factors such as local interactions or those with
the ligand. The result suggests that ﬂexibility is an intrinsic property
of amino acids.

As ﬂexibility correlates with entropy differences, it is interesting
to see if there are differences between ﬂexible and rigid residues with
respect to quantities related to geometric constraints. In particular,
b—factors and solvent accessible surface (SAS) areas. We observe
greater SAS and b—factors for ﬂexible residues (Fig. 4). These
differences suggest that it should be possible to identify ﬂexible
residues in the Apo form.

It was previously suggested that ligand binding induces NR
conformations for some amino acid types (Heringa and Argos,
1999). In our dataset, we do not detect any pronounced differences
in the number residues in NR conformations between H010 and Apo
forms with 127 versus 104 cases (out of 2395 residues). Finally,
it was observed that side chains with unfavorable conformations
are more mobile than rotameric ones (Carugo and Argos, 1997).
Assuming that all side chains observed in NR conformation in the
Apo form underwent considerable movements upon binding, we can
place an upper bound on the number of residues in NR conformations
undergoing large rotations and compare to the number of residues in
rotameric states undergoing equally large rotations. We observe 375
NR conformations in the Apo form (an overestimation considering
the assumption of movement between NR conformations) compared
to 368 rotameric conformations that undergo rotamer change (to
another rotamer or an NR conformation). Although we do not make
a distinction according to amino acid types, we do not observe that
NR conformations are more mobile than rotameric ones.

3.3.] Hydrogen bonding network We are also interested to
understand how enthalpic factors may affect ﬂexibility. We focus
on hydrogen bonds (H—bonds) as this is one of the most important

freedom of movement in the unbound form is quantiﬁed using b—factors
whereas the lower part represents the normalized solvent accessible surface
areas (SAS). Rigid (blue) and ﬂexible (green) residues are compared.
Residues are ordered in respect to the ﬂexibility scale. Student t—tests are
used for statistical signiﬁcance

ligand—protein—speciﬁc interactions. For simplicity, we focus only
on the number of H—bonds conserved, gained or lost upon binding
and not on a detailed case—speciﬁc analysis of rearrangements of the
H—bond network that occurs upon binding. This is because we do not
have any information on the pathway (within the H—bond network)
or dynamic aspects of such changes for each enzyme as we only
use X—ray structures representing the initial and ﬁnal states of the
binding process. Therefore, any cases where the rearrangement of
the H—bond network does not change the total number of H—bonds
that occur involving protein and water atoms upon introduction of
the ligand cannot be detected.

In order to understand the contribution of H—bonding ﬂexibility,
we calculated the average number of H—bonds formed with the
protein and water molecules. We notice that for His, Arg, Lys,
Ser and Thr, they participate in more H—bonds when they are rigid
(Supplementary Fig. S7). For the remaining residues, we do not
observe a statistically signiﬁcant difference between ﬂexible and
rigid. This shows that upon binding of a ligand, the H—bonding
interactions are easily broken. Glu has a lower probability of moving
than expected considering its number of ﬂexible bonds. This may be
due to the fact that acidic residues have a high tendency to participate
in H—bonding (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Although there are small differences on the pattern of H—bonds
conserved, gained or lost with water molecules for different amino
acid types (Supplementary Fig. 8A and B), the overall rates are
essentially indistinguishable between ﬂexible and rigid side—chains
(left bars, Fig. 5). Approximately 35% of residues lost H—bonds with
water, as expected considering that water molecules within the cleft
must be displaced during binding, while others may be necessary
for enzyme reaction (Okada et al., 2002; Stillman et al., 1993).
Interestingly, only around 15% of residues gain H—bonds with water.

Fig. 5. Rearrangement of the Hydrogen bonding network. We plot the
proportion of residues that conserve the number, gain or loose H—bonds with
water molecules, protein or ligand atoms. We observe a 36% decrease in the
number of H—bonds between binding—site residues and water molecules with
a concomitant increase of the number of H—bonds for with protein atoms
for ﬂexible residues (center left), likely formed with rigid residues as these
conserve the number of H—bonds in 80% (center right) of cases. Interestingly,
~75% of residues that could form H—bonds with the ligand upon binding do
not fulﬁll these interactions (right—hand bars)

We also compare the number of H—bonds formed within the
protein (center bars Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. 8C and D). Rigid
residues maintain the number H—bonds in 80% of cases compared
to 60% for ﬂexible residues. This result supports our rotamer—based
approach in the sense that residues that did not signiﬁcantly move
(rigid residues) are less prone to create or lose H—bonds than ﬂexible
residues. On the other hand, ﬂexible residues have a slightly higher
H—bond gain than loss. This result raises the possibility that ﬂexible
residues are replacing H—bonds with rigid residues that occurred
before binding with water molecules. We also analyzed the number
of H—bonds between the protein and the ligand for ﬂexible and
rigid residues. We notice a slight increase in the formation of H—
bonds with the ligand for ﬂexible residues (28% over 22% for
rigid) for residues that initially formed H—bonds with the protein
(Supplementary Table SIV). Interestingly, three quarters of the
residues that participate (or can participate) in H—bonds do not create
H—bonds with the ligand (right bars Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig.
8E and F). As such, there is a vast untapped well of potential
interactions occurring unfulﬁlled or fulﬁlled with protein atoms
and/or water molecules that could be exploited in terms of creating
new interactions with, for example, an inhibitor.

4 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we show side—chain rotamer changes upon binding
are widespread occurring in nearly 90% of binding sites studied.
Moreover, in 32% of ﬂexible cases (28% overall), steric clashes
would prevent ligand binding in the absence of movements. In the
context of molecular docking, one may not succeed in ﬁnding the
right solution in a large fraction of cases if the protein is not allowed
to be ﬂexible. At the same time, it is feasible to introduce side—chain
ﬂexibility on a limited number of residues as our results show that
ﬁve ﬂexible side chains account for 90% of the observed cases.

Overall, we studied 2395 side chains. Of these, 472 undergo side—
chain rotamer changes or ~20% of all residues. We detected 170
residues whose movements are critical for binding. Among these,
37 undergo dihedral angle rotations of 15° or less distributed among
34 binding sites (18% of all binding sites). Zavodsky and Kuhn
(2005) state that ‘Most side chains do not shift to a new rotamer, and
small motions are both necessary and sufﬁcient to predict the correct
binding orientation and most protein—ligand interactions for the 20
proteins analyzed’. In our dataset, the minimal rotation hypothesis
applies to ~22% of (37/ 170) of all sterically critical residues, while
the other 78% are accommodated by larger rotations that may or may
not lead to a rotamer change, almost four times the cases covered
by the minimal rotation hypothesis.

We observe that side—chain ﬂexibility reﬂects an intrinsic property
of amino acid side chains as it is correlated to conﬁgurational entropy
differences. Indeed, side chains in the Apo form with higher mobility
(b—factors) and exposed surface to the solvent are more likely to
undergo side—chain rotamer changes.

Interestingly, we observe a rearrangement of the H—bond network
that leads us to propose that upon binding, there is a disruption
of H—bonds with water concomitant with a gain of H—bonds for
ﬂexible residues, leading to conservation of the number of H—bonds
of rigid residues. Furthermore, 75% of residues with potential to
form H—bonds do not change the number of H—bonds in which they
participate. This points to the possibility that there is a vast potential
to develop inhibitors that could take advantage of this undisturbed
H—bond network to modulate selectivity and speciﬁcity.

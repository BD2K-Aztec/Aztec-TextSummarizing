ABSTRACT

Summary: The structural genomics of histone tail recognition web
server is an open access resource that presents within mini articles
all publicly available experimental structures of histone tails in
complex with human proteins. Each article is composed of interactive
3D slides that dissect the structural mechanism underlying the
recognition of specific sequences and histone marks. A concise
text html-linked to interactive graphics guides the reader through
the main features of the interaction. This resource can be used
to analyze and compare binding modes across multiple histone
recognition modules, to evaluate the chemical tractability of binding
sites involved in epigenetic signaling and design small molecule
inhibitors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Post-translational modiﬁcations of histone proteins regulate chro-
matin compaction, mediate epigenetic regulation of transcription
and control cellular differentiation in health and disease (Grewal
and Moazed, 2003). A variety of epigenetic marks are deposited,
removed and sensed individually and in combinations by so-called
‘Writers, erasers and readers’ of the ‘histone code’ (Jenuwein and
Allis, 2001; Kouzarides, 2007; Strahl and Allis, 2000). Most post-
translational modiﬁcations occur at lysine residues on the N-terminal
unstructured portion of histones.

The structural mechanisms underlying speciﬁc recognition of
histone tail sequences and post-translational modiﬁcations are
central to the emerging concept of chromatin as a complex signaling
platform where diverse epigenetic marks can make or break circuits
in a synergistic or antagonistic manner (Fischle et al., 2003a, b;
Garske et al., 2010; Latham and Dent, 2007). Additionally, the
binding mode of individual histone tail side chains to catalytic

domains or effector modules can be used as a guide to design
competitive inhibitors (Culhane et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009).

We have developed the structural genomics of histone tail
recognition web server. This resource allows the user to browse
within mini articles high—quality graphics and interactive 3D slides
of all available crystal and nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
structures of human proteins in complex with histone tail peptides.
Each article highlights the main features of the structures, and
the recognition mechanism at atomic resolution. The intuitive and
easy-to-use interface has been designed to facilitate the analysis
of structural features, even if the user does not have any previous
experience in molecular graphics programs. It is hoped that this
resource, updated on a monthly basis, will prove itself useful to
decode the structural determinants of histone recognition and design
chemical inhibitors targeting the writers, readers and erasers of
histone marks.

2 RESULTS

The server contains, as of May 2010, structures of 47 histone—
protein complexes organized along schematic representations of
histone H3, H4 and H2A.x tails. The name of each gene is
linked to its corresponding set of 3D slides, and color-coded based
on the nature of the histone binding domain. Twelve structure
classes are represented: histone methyltransferases (Cheng et al.,
2005; Copeland et al., 2009), lysine demethylases (Marmorstein
and Trievel, 2009), bromodomains (Mujtaba et al., 2007; Taverna
et al., 2007), histone acetyltransferases (Bemdsen and Denu, 2008;
Marmorstein and Trievel, 2009), six readers of methylated lysine
(MBTs, Tudor, PHDs, Chromo, PWWP and ‘Other’ domains)
(Adams-Cioaba and Min, 2009; Taverna et al., 2007) and the two
readers of phosphorylation marks 14-3-3 and BRCT (Macdonald
et al., 2005; Stucki et al., 2005).

All 3D articles follow the same template. The opening View
shows a molecular surface of the protein with electrostatic potential
coloring and bound histone. Successive bullet points in the mini—
article, linked to interactive 3D slides, guide the reader through the
main features of histone recognition as follows. (i) Overall topology
of the structure, which highlights the tertiary arrangement of the
molecule, and the relative orientation of multiple domains when
applicable. This View is useful, for instance, to see how the histone
H3 tail is sandwiched between the JMJ and PHD domains of PHF8
(Horton et al., 2010). (ii) Hydrogen bonds between the histone

peptide and its recognition platform. This View highlights with
atomic resolution interactions that typically act as determinant for
speciﬁcity. Water molecules mediating interactions are also shown.
Residue numbers are accessible by a single click, which can be
useful to scientists wishing to follow-up with targeted mutagenesis.
(iii) Molecular surface of the binding site with bound histone tail.
This View reveals side chains that contribute the most to binding, and
may be used as a guide to design selective inhibitors, as illustrated
in the structure browser of the methyltransferase GLP. 3D slides
clearly show how (a) two inhibitors occupy the histone binding
site (b) both inhibitors mimic the interaction of Arg 8 of histone
3 (H3R8) with the receptor and (c) the most potent inhibitor also
occupies the substrate lysine (H3K9) binding channel (Chang et al.,
2009; Liu et al., 2009). (iV) Electrostatics of the entire structure,
which provides a more realistic rendition of the overall complex.

Ad hoc bullet points are often complementing this basic template
to present features reported in published articles. Finally, a color—
coded amino acid sequence of the protein highlights residues
hydrogen bonded to the histone tail.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Structural analyses are carried out—and 3D graphics generated—
with the software ICM (Molsoft LLC). The activeICM and iSee
technology, recently developed for publishing 3D content, is used to
illustrate the web version of the articles (Abagyan et al. , 2006; Raush
et al., 2009). On their ﬁrst Visit, users are asked to download a free,
cross-platform, browser-independent plug-in, necessary to embed
interactive graphics within a web browser. Articles are divided into
two panes, one for text and one for graphics. HTML links in the text
window trigger 3D slides in the graphics window, allowing rotation
and zooming (Supplementary Fig. 1). For any structure, users can
also choose to Visualize histograms showing the number of hydrogen
bonds engaged with side— and main chain of each histone residue.

The Protein Databank is scanned on a monthly basis to identify
novel structures of human proteins in complex with histone tails.
Updates are completed within 4 weeks, which ensures that the
resource is not outdated by more than 2 months.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Organic enzyme cofactors are involved in many enzyme
reactions. Therefore, the analysis of cofactors is crucial to gain
a better understanding of enzyme catalysis. To aid this, we have
created the CoFactor database.

Results: CoFactor provides a web interface to access hand-curated
data extracted from the literature on organic enzyme cofactors in
biocatalysis, as well as automatically collected information. CoFactor
includes information on the conformational and solvent accessibility
variation of the enzyme-bound cofactors, as well as mechanistic and
structural information about the hosting enzymes.

Availability: The database is publicly available and can be accessed
at http://www.ebi.ac.uk/thornton-srv/databases/CoFactor

Contact: julia.fischer@ebi.ac.uk

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enzymes are proteins that catalyze the repertoire of chemical
reactions found in nature, and as such are vitally important
molecules. They are generally composed of the 20 common amino
acid residues, but many also require small molecules in addition for
the catalysis to occur. In some cases, these molecules are involved in
regulation or in ensuring the correct folding remote from the active
site. However, many are termed cofactors, as they are required in
the active site and are directly involved in catalysis. These cofactors
may be either metal ions, whose involvement in catalysis we handle
in Metal—MACiE (Andreini et al., 2009), or small organic molecules,
which are described here. In both cases, these cofactors extend and
enhance the basic catalytic toolkit of enzymes.

To date, there has been little collation of information on organic
cofactors and their functions outside of the primary literature.
CoFactor has been designed to remedy this, as MACiE (Holliday
et al., 2007) and Metal—MACiE were designed to collate data on
enzyme mechanisms and metal ions in catalysis, respectively.

2 DATA CONTENT

The CoFactor database contains 27 entries for organic enzyme
cofactors (see Supplementary Table S 1). On the index page, the user
can choose which cofactor entry to view. The left—hand navigation
contains links to all the pages described, as well as to the home page,

a glossary page, a contact form and a database statistics page. For
each cofactor, the web site provides:

(1) Overview page—hand—curated information, mostly from
primary literature. This includes general information about
the molecule, its chemical properties, and about pathways
where appropriate.

(2) Mechanism (if available in MACiE)—in the standard curly
arrow representation of organic chemistry and an optional
textual description.

(3) Enzymes and domains—enzyme information is integrated
with associated 3D structures from PDBe, PDBsum,
(Laskowski, 2009), CATH domains (Orengo et al., 1997),
MACiE enzyme mechanism, proteins that have been assigned
this E.C. number according to Uniprot (Consortium, 2008),
as well as a reference that documents the provenance of the
information.

(4) (a) Enzymes that use this cofactor—including visual
representations of the cofactor’s distribution over enzyme
reaction space and its chemical proﬁle, based on the
enzyme classiﬁcation (NC—IUBMB and Webb, 1992).

(b) Enzymes that synthesize this cofactor.

(c) Enzymes that recycle this cofactor (if known and
applicable).

(d) Domains that bind this cofactor, taken from
PROCOGNATE (Bashton et al., 2006).

(5) Compound—names and identiﬁers of the same molecule in
ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2008), KEGG COMPOUND
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), PDBeChem (Boutselakis et al.,
2003) and PROCOGNATE (Bashton et al., 2006). For each
PDB HET code, the web site provides:

(a) Conformation of the cofactor—shows the superimposed
molecules, as described in Section 3, in a three—
dimensional molecule viewer.

(b) Solvent accessibility—displays the average atomic
solvent accessibility and its standard deviation for each
HET code (PDB identiﬁer for non—amino acid molecules)
associated with this cofactor.

3 METHODS

The data collection process used to populate the database is summarized in
Figure 1.

All X—ray and NMR structures in the PDBe biological assemblies database
(Boutselakis et al., 2003), which contain a HET group assigned to a cofactor,
have been used for the superposition and solvent accessibility calculations.
All instances of one cofactor HET group have been superimposed on a

applied to compute the solvent accessibility of each atom a in each cofactor
twice: ﬁrst for the biological assembly (SAbiOlAssemb1y(a)) and second for the
cofactor alone SAcofactorAlone(Cl). The relative solvent accessibility of each
atom a RSA(a) has been calculated as shown in below.

The mechanisms are based on all the information on a cofactor molecule
in MACiE. A11 mechanisms have been visually inspected and all substrates
and products have been abstracted to be reduced to the essential bonds that
are involved in the reaction mechanism catalyzed by this cofactor.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

The CoFactor database provides an overview for each organic
enzyme cofactor. It integrates information on the organic compounds
with protein structures, domains, sequences, enzyme reactions and
mechanisms. These data can be used to learn about the tasks of
cofactors in biocatalysis and an analysis of cofactor properties,
structure and function is in progress (Fischer, J.D. et al., submitted
for publication). Most of the cofactors have been known for many
years, with very few recent discoveries. Therefore, we do not expect
that this data resource will require major changes in the future.

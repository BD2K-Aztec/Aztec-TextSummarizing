ABSTRACT

Summary: phyloMeta is an easy to use console program
for integrating phylogenetic information into meta-analysis. It is
designed to help ecologists, evolutionary biologists and conservation
biologists analyze effect size data extracted from published studies
in a comparative phylogenetic context. This software estimates
phylogenetic versions of all the traditional meta-analytical statistics
used for: pooling effect sizes with weighted regressions; evaluating
the homogeneity of these effect sizes; performing moderator tests
akin to ANOVA style analyses; and analyzing data with fixed- and
random-effects models. phyloMeta is developed in C/C++ and can
be used via command line in MS Windows environments.
Availability: phyloMeta can be obtained freely as an executable on
the web at http://lajeunesse.myweb.usf.edu/publications

1 INTRODUCTION

The statistics of meta-analysis consist of quantifying experimental
outcomes with effect sizes, assigning a weight to each effect size
that is inversely proportional to its variance, and then averaging
these weighted effect sizes to provide an overall synthesis of
multiple published studies (Hedges and Olkin, 1985). Ecologists
and evolutionary biologists rely heavily on these statistics to
provide research summaries and to test hypotheses on moderators of
experimental outcomes—often pooling research from different taxa
to achieve these goals (Lajeunesse, 2010).

However, pooling effect size data from multiple taxa can
potentially bias the outcome of meta-analysis because of the
non-independence of effect sizes due to the shared phylogenetic
history of taxa (Lajeunesse, 2009). phyloMeta ﬁlls a gap in the
statistical tools needed to assess and account for this form of
non—independence when performing a meta-analysis on ecological
research. This software reports all the familiar statistics of meta-
analysis (e.g. pooled effect sizes paired with 95% conﬁdence
intervals and homogeneity tests) along with phylogenetic versions
of these statistics (as reported in Lajeunesse, 2009; Lajeunesse
et al., 2011). My intention with this software is to overcome the
current limitations of Widespread meta-analytical software such
as metaWin (Rosenberg et al., 2000) and the emerging metafor
package in R (Viechtbauer, 2010). These tools are unable to integrate
the covariances necessary to account for phylogenetic correlations
among effect sizes from related taxa.

2 STATISTICAL METHODS

The statistical methods reported by phyloMeta are based on
the generalized least squares (GLS) approach to meta-analysis
described by Lajeunesse (2009) and Lajeunesse et al. (2011).
These include: weighted regressions to pool effect sizes paired
with conﬁdence intervals; homogeneity statistics (Q-tests) used
for evaluating Whether effect size should be pooled Without bias;
conservative adjustments of homogeneity tests should the phylogeny
contain polytomies; analyses for both ﬁxed- and random-effects
models; ANOVA style moderator analyses, based on partitioning
Within- and between— group homogeneity tests; calculation of model
selection criteria (AIC scores) to evaluate the relative ﬁt of
competing regression models. These methods are modiﬁcations of
the regression models of Hedges and Olkin (1985) and Hedges
(1992).

Brieﬂy for example, in a ﬁxed-effects meta-analysis of k number
of effect sizes, the following GLS regression equation in matrix
notation is used to pool all these k effects into an overall average
effect 3:

3=(XTw—1X)—1xTw—1E, (1)
Where X is a k X 1 column vector of ones, E is a k X 1 column vector
of the effect sizes, and W is the variance—covariance matrix that
deﬁnes how effect sizes are to be weighted and how they relate to
one another, and is deﬁned as:

W=DPD. (2)

This variance—covariance matrix contains the weights due to
sampling error as required by meta-analysis (these are deﬁned
in D, a k Xk diagonal matrix of the SDs of each effect size)
and the phylogenetic correlations. The phylogenetic correlations
P is a k X k diagonal matrix containing the shared branch length
distances of each taxa on a phylogenetic tree. See Rohlf (2001)
for an example of this correlation matrix. In a traditional meta-
analysis, P is simply deﬁned as an Identity matrix—indicating
that effect sizes are independent (Lajeunesse, 2009). Currently,
phyloMeta (V. 1.3 as of 05/12/2011) assumes, as in Felsenstein’s
(1985) phylogenetically independent contrasts, that branch lengths
are proportional to the expected change (e.g. a Brownian motion
model of evolution). Future releases will include diagnostics of this
assumption [as described in Lajeunesse (2009)].

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The software requires no installation and little input from the user
other than a text ﬁle containing the meta-analytical data and second

text ﬁle of the hypothesized phylogeny in NEWICK format. This
NEWICK tree is converted into a correlation matrix (P) that is
integrated into the GLS weighted regression models (Lajeunesse,
2009). Users are prompted for the names of each ﬁle on each run,
and all analyses (e.g. Q-tests, ﬁxed- and random-effects models)
are executed automatically. As a console program, phyloMeta also
accepts these two ﬁle names as command line arguments; this
facilitates the calling of phyloMeta in R for rapid Visualization of
results or for simulation analyses.

After each run, phyloMeta saves all the results in a single text
ﬁle. Finally, phyloMeta can analyze data based on any effect size
metric (e.g. Hedges’ d, log response ratio, correlations) as long as
these data are paired with valid variance estimates. By deﬁnition,
variances are required for meta-analysis and are used as weights in
a weighted regression (Hedges, 1992).

I currently compile phyloMeta with an early version of MS VC++
(6.0) to avoid use of the Windows .Net framework. This allows
for a broad portability among early and later releases of Microsoft
Windows (i.e. NT, XP, Vista, Windows 7) without any additional
installation from the user.

4 PUBLISHED APPLICATIONS

Several published meta-analyses have already used a beta version
of phyloMeta for pooling and testing hypotheses with effect size
data in a phylogenetic context. I highlight below a few of these
studies to emphasize the potential broad applications of phyloMeta
for ecological synthesis. These studies also serve as illustrative
examples on how to use and report the output of phyloMeta,
and provide important information on how to acquire or construct
phylogenetic trees for meta-analysis.

For example, Carmona et al. (2011) pooled correlations among
40 plant species to test the importance of secondary metabolites
over other plant characteristics (e. g. life history traits) as predictors
of anti-herbivore defense. They found no signiﬁcant differences
between the traditional and phylogenetically independent meta-
analyses, and chose to report only the latter. Their phylogenetic tree
of plants was estimated using phylomatic (Webb and Donoghue,
2004) with internal branch length distances based on divergence
times found on the timetree website (Hedges and Kumar, 2009).
Meunier et al. (2011) also pooled correlations with phyloMeta,
but here focused on testing hypotheses of the adaptive function of
melanin-based coloration in 26 bird species. In this meta-analysis,
they used a molecular phylogeny estimated from gene sequence
data publically available online at GenBank. In another meta-
analysis, results from traditional and phylogenetically independent
meta-analysis were compared among studies based on 87 plant
species to evaluate correlations between ﬁtness and ﬂowering
synchrony (Munguia—Rosas et al., 2011). Finally, Ord et al. (2011)
broadly surveyed published research on amphibians, birds, ﬁsh,
mammals and insects to test how animals respond to encounters
with conspeciﬁc or heterospeciﬁc species in their environments. For
their meta-analysis, they used a composite phylogenetic tree with

a topology derived from public web databases (e. g. Encyclopedia of
Life, eol. org) and published phylogenies.

5 CONCLUSION AND PROSPECTUS

phyloMeta is a stand-alone software for assessing and accounting
of phylogenetic non-independence of meta-analytical data. I am
continuously developing this software and custom versions can be
made upon request for speciﬁc research requirements.

Further developments of the software will include optimizations
Via maximum likelihood for different models of evolution [e. g.
Ornstein—Uhlenbeck processes; Lajeunesse (2009)], and integration
of diagnostics useful for evaluating phylogenetic bias and
publication bias in effect size data.

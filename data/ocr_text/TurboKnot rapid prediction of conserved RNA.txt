ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many RNA molecules function without being translated
into proteins, and function depends on structure. Pseudoknots are
motifs in RNA secondary structures that are difficult to predict but
are also often functionally important.

Results: TurboKnot is a new algorithm for predicting the secondary
structure, including pseudoknotted pairs, conserved across multiple
sequences. TurboKnot finds 81.6% of all known base pairs in
the systems tested, and 75.6% of predicted pairs were found in the
known structures. Pseudoknots are found with half or better of the
false-positive rate of previous methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

In many cases, RNA functions in cells without being translated into
proteins. These non—coding RNAs (ncRNAs) carry out a wide range
of functions, including catalysis, intracellular protein trafﬁcking,
immunity and gene regulation (Doudna and Cech, 2002; Gesteland
et al., 2005; Marrafﬁni and Sontheimer, 2010; Nissen et al., 2000;
Tucker and Breaker, 2005; Walter and Blobel, 1982; Wu and
Belasco, 2008). The functions of these ncRNAs depend on their
structures.

RNA structure is hierarchical, beginning with the sequence of
nucleotides (the primary structure), then the set of all canonical,
i.e. GC, AU and GU base pairs (the secondary structure), and
ultimately the full 3D positioning of all the atoms in the molecule
(the tertiary structure). The secondary structure tends to form
on a faster time scale and with stronger interactions than those
interactions that fold the tertiary structure, so the secondary structure
can usually be predicted independently of knowing the overall
tertiary structure (Tinoco and Bustamante, 1999).

The most accurate method of secondary structure determination
is comparative sequence analysis. It relies on the hypothesis that
sequences that serve the same function share the same structure.
But comparative sequence analysis is impractical in many situations

because it requires signiﬁcant human insight and a large number
of diverse sequences (Gutell et al., 2002; Woese and Pace, 1993).
Commonly, the secondary structure for a single sequence is predicted
using free energy minimization. These methods use a set of
thermodynamic parameters that predict the folding free energy
change of a given structure and a dynamic programming algorithm
to ﬁnd the structure with lowest free energy change (Mathews and
Turner, 2006; Mathews et al., 2004).

The thermodynamic parameters can be used with a different type
of dynamic programming algorithm to predict a partition function,
which can be used to predict the base pairing probability for all
possible canonical pairs (McCaskill, 1990). Base pair probabilities
can be used to assemble structures called maximum expected
accuracy (MEA) structures (Do at al., 2006; Hamada et al., 2009;
Knudsen and Hein, 1999; Lu et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, MEA prediction
seeks to maximize the sum of probabilities of each base pair for
all paired bases and the probabilities of being single—stranded for
all unpaired bases. Empirically, MEA structure prediction works
because that base pairs predicted to be the most probable are the
most likely to be in the known structure (Mathews, 2004).

Although comparative sequence analysis is not yet automated,
a number of methods have been developed to improve structure
prediction by using the information available in homologous
sequences. (Bernhart et al., 2008; Harmanci et al., 2007, 2008;
Mathews and Turner, 2002; Steffen et al., 2006; Will et al., 2007;
Xu et al., 2007). These methods use a supplied input sequence
alignment, predict the structure for each sequence and then ﬁnd the
common structure, or align and fold the sequences simultaneously.
These programs have been reviewed previously (Bernhart et al.,
2008).

The recently published TurboFold algorithm is one such method
that improves secondary structure prediction by predicting a
conserved structure using two or more homologous sequences
(Harmanci et al., 2011). It reﬁnes base pairing probabilities of an
arbitrary number of sequences using their probabilistic alignments
in an iterative manner. Structures are then assembled using a MEA
algorithm from the ﬁnal set of base pairing probabilities.

Because of computational complexity, most programs that predict
secondary structure do not predict pseudoknots. Formally, a
pseudoknot occurs if an RNA has two base pairs, one between bases
1’ and j, and a second between i’ and j’, such that i< i’ <j< j’.
Pseudoknots make up only a small fraction of base pairs, but they
are often found in ncRNAs. Predicting the minimum free energy
secondary structure that includes pseudoknots of any topology has
been proven to be NP—hard (Lyngsgzs and Pederson, 2000). In spite of
this, a number of single—sequence methods have been developed to

predict structures with pseudoknots (Akutsu, 2000; Condon et al.,
2004; Dirks and Pierce, 2003; Reeder and Giegerich, 2004; Rivas
and Eddy, 1999; Uemura et al., 1999). These methods limit the set of
possible pseudoknot topologies to accelerate the search. A number of
available methods has been previously reviewed (Liu et al., 2010).

Recently, a new algorithm was published, ProbKnot, that uses a
single sequence partition function to predict pairing probabilities and
assigns base pairs if the two bases are mutually maximally probable
to pair with one another (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010). This
algorithm can ﬁnd pseudoknots of any topology. While the partition
function does not include terms for pseudoknotted structures, the
ProbKnot algorithm was able to ﬁnd pseudoknotted base pairs with
reasonable accuracy compared with other methods, and at minimal
computational cost: the algorithm is 0(N2) in addition to the 0(N3)
partition function calculation.

Approaches to the pseudoknot prediction problem that employ
information from sequence and structural homology are few in
number. Like single sequence methods (Abrahams et al., 1990;
Isambert and Siggia, 2000), a Monte Carlo alignment and folding
method has also been published (Meyer and Miklos, 2007). Also
analogous to single sequence methods (Dawson et al., 2007; J abbari
et al., 2008; Ren et al., 2005), another approach identiﬁes common
pseudoknot—free structures and then iteratively matches regions
that can form pseudoknots (Ruan et al., 2004). A third approach
computes a score matrix based on alignment and thermodynamic
information and uses a maximum weight matching (MWM)
algorithm to assemble an optimal secondary structure (Tabaska et al.,
1998; Witwer et al., 2004). The latter two approaches are dependent
on a high—quality sequence alignment as input, either one assembled
manually or one computed from sequences with a large degree of
sequence identity (70% or more). Such alignments are not always
available, particularly for newly discovered classes of RNAs.

This contribution reports a new algorithm, TurboKnot, for
predicting RNA secondary structures conserved in multiple
sequences, including pseudoknots. TurboKnot assembles structures
in the same way as ProbKnot, but with the pairing probabilities
predicted by a TurboFold calculation using multiple sequences to
inform the pairing probabilities. The additional computational cost
compared with TurboFold is small compared with the TurboFold
calculation itself, just 0(MN2), where M is the number of sequences
used and N is the length of the longest sequence. It is benchmarked
against two algorithms capable of predicting pseudoknots that also
use multiple sequences as input, ILM and meatch (Ruan et al.,
2004; Witwer et al., 2004). It is also benchmarked against the single
sequence ProbKnot algorithm (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010).
Finally, two algorithms that cannot predict pseudoknots are included
in the benchmark, TurboFold (Harmanci et al., 2011) and MEA
(MaxExpect) (Lu et al., 2009).

2 METHODS
2.1 Predicting base pair probabilities

For TurboKnot, base pair probabilities were predicted using TurboFold
(Harmanci et al., 2011). This algorithm employs the nearest neighbor
thermodynamic parameters (Mathews et al., 1999, 2004; Xia et al., 1998).
The per—branching—helix bonus parameter, however, was left at —0.6 kcal/mol,
consistent with optical melting data (Diamond et al., 2001), rather than using
the optimized parameter of Mathews et a]. (2004). TurboFold was run using
four iterations instead of the default of three for an increase in accuracy at

the expense of computational cost, but otherwise was run with the default
parameters.

2.2 Assembling structures

Structures were constructed using the same method as the ProbKnot
algorithm. First, maximal pairing probabilities for each base i were identiﬁed
from the TurboFold output and stored in an array Pmax(i). Next, all pairing
probabilities for all base pairs, P(i , j) were checked, and if P(i, j) is equal to
Pmax(i) and PmaxU), a base pair was assigned between bases i and j. This
process can be iterated, where subsequent iterations only examine the bases
that remained unpaired from previous iterations, but subsequent iterations
were not found to increase the accuracy of the results (data not shown).
Finally, all base pairs involved in helices shorter in length than 3 bp were
removed (helices were not considered to be interrupted by single bulges
or 1 x 1 internal loops). This structure prediction process was performed
independently for each sequence run in a single TurboFold calculation.

2.3 MWM

MWM calculations were performed with Wmatch from MATHPROG
(http://elib.zib.de/pub/Packages/mathprog/matching/weighted/) (Micali and
Vazirani, 1980). Edges were only supplied to the algorithm for consideration
if their computed pairing probability was 210—6. As with TurboKnot, all
helices shorter than 3 bp were removed from the structure.

2.4 Assessment

Sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) were used to evaluate each
algorithm tested. Sensitivity measures the fraction of pairs in each known
structure found:

. . . True Positive Pairs
Sens1t1v1ty =

 

True Positive Pairs + False Negative Pairs
PPV measures the fraction of pairs predicted that are correct:

True Positive Pairs

 

PPV: . . . . . .
True Pos1t1ve Pairs + False Pos1t1ve Pairs

Because it is difﬁcult to determine the exact register of pairs by comparative
analysis and because pairing can ﬂuctuate because of thermal motions,
predicted base pairs between iand j were counted as correct if iwas paired
with j, j— 1, or j+1, or ifj was paired with i—l or i+1. Assessment
using only exact matching base pairs is supplied in Supplementary
Tables SI and S2.

All sequences were tested on a randomly chosen subset (with replacement)
of seven different subtypes of RNA: SS RNA, tRNA, RNase P RNA, SRP
RNA, tmRNA, telomerase RNA and group I introns (Brown, 1998; Chen
et al., 2000; Damberger and Gutell, 1994; Sprinzl et al., 1998; Szymanski
et al., 1998; Waring and Davies, 1984; Zwieb and Wower, 2000). For
all multisequence methods, ﬁve RNAs of each type were selected to be
computed together in each calculation. Particular RNA sequences could
be chosen more than once as a part of different calculations. These were
considered to be separate results, as multiple sequence methods may give
different results for the same sequence depending on the other sequences used
in the calculation. For consistency, duplicate sequences were also counted
as independent calculations when using single—sequence methods to predict
structures, even though the resulting structures would be identical. Average
values of sensitivity and PPV were computed for each class of RNAs. The
overall average is the mean of the individual averages on sequence types.

2.5 Pseudoknot evaluation

Pseudoknots were identiﬁed using the algorithm of Smit et a]. (2008) to
identify the fewest pairs that could be removed to remove the pseudoknot
from the structure. Predicted pseudoknotted base pairs were only counted

as correct if the i— j pair was in the accepted structure (allowing thermal
ﬂuctuation as in Section 2.4), the pair was counted as a pseudoknot by the
Smit et al. algorithm, and the pair was pseudoknotted. A pair was considered
pseudoknotted if it met the i< i/ < j < j/ criterion, with at least one other
pair i/ — j/ that was also a correct pair compared with the accepted structure
(Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010).

3 RESULTS

Over the range of RNA families tested, which have a variety of
functions and structures, TurboKnot averaged a sensitivity of 79.8%
(Table 1) and a PPV of 72.9% (Table 2). For comparison, TurboKnot
was benchmarked against two other multisequence methods that
can predict pseudoknots: ILM version 1.0 (Ruan et al., 2004)
and meatch version 1.2.1 (Witwer et al., 2004). Each was run
with default parameters. Sequences were aligned for input into
these algorithms using MUSCLE version 3.6 (Edgar, 2004), which
performs well for RNA sequence alignment compared with other
available tools (Wilm et al., 2006). In addition to these two methods,
benchmarks were run using ProbKnot (Bellaousov and Mathews,
2010), a single sequence method that can predict pseudoknots,
TurboFold (Harmanci et al., 2011), the underlying multisequence

method that cannot predict pseudoknots and MaxExpect (Lu et al.,
2009), a single sequence method that cannot predict pseudoknots.
Other single—sequence methods capable of predicting pseudoknots
were recently benchmarked (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010), and
ProbKnot compares favorably against these. It is used here as a
representative of this class of algorithms. One algorithm, DotKnot,
has been published more recently. Its performance on this test
set is included in Supplementary Tables S3—SS for comparison.
Similarly, multisequence algorithms that cannot predict pseudoknots
were recently benchmarked (Harmanci et al., 2011), and TurboFold
compares favorable and is used as a representative of them here.

The average sensitivity and PPV of TurboKnot were better than
any other method capable of predicting pseudoknots. Additionally,
TurboKnot had a higher sensitivity than TurboFold, albeit at a trade—
off in PPV. Since TurboKnot considers a larger structure space than
TurboFold, it is natural to ﬁnd more correct base pairs with a cost
to the PPV.

For pseudoknots in particular, TurboKnot found 289 correct
pseudoknotted base pairs out of a total of 5897 in the
known structures, and it made 672 false positive predictions of
pseudoknotted pairs (Table 3). This is more true positives and fewer
false positives than any other tested method. When considering

structures with pseudoknots rather than individual pairs, TurboKnot
found at least one true positive pseudoknot in 59 structures out of
239 predictions, and out of 426 tested structures that contain at least
one pseudoknot (Supplementary Table S6). This is again more true
positives and fewer false positives than any other tested method.

The use of an MWM algorithm to assemble structures given
the TurboFold pair probabilities was also considered as a control
(Supplementary Tables S7 and S8). This approach resulted in the
identiﬁcation of the exact same set of correct base pairs as those
based on mutual maximum probability pairs, plus a small number of
extra incorrect pairs. The additional, incorrect pairs were so few that
they only affected the second decimal places of the PPV percentages.
The exception was the tmRNA family, in which a small number of
additional correct base pairs were identiﬁed. The minor difference
between these two approaches was due to how well the TurboFold
algorithm reﬁnes the pairing probabilities by excluding structures
that are not conserved.

As another control, an MWM algorithm was used to predict
structures from pair probabilities calculated using a single sequence
partition function. This added a number of spurious base pairs

(Supplementary Table S9). This emphasized the importance of the
ProbKnot approach when single sequences are used.

Time benchmarks were performed on all tested algorithms.
Groups of ﬁve random sequences were used, with average lengths
varying from 80.0 nt to 458.8 nt (Table 4). The meatch algorithm
performed the fastest. TurboKnot was signiﬁcantly slower, but it
could still carry out the computations in a reasonable amount of
time for a user with a typical desktop computer.

Figure 1 shows a sample structure prediction for Mycobacterium
tuberculosis RNase P using TurboKnot, ProbKnot or TurboFold
(Brown, 1998). The TurboKnot and TurboFold structures are similar,
but the TurboKnot algorithm is able to identify most of the
pseudoknotted base pairs. ProbKnot has a lower sensitivity and
PPV overall for non—pseudoknotted base pairs in this structure. It
identiﬁes the four correct pseudoknotted base pairs that TurboKnot
missed, but it also ﬁnds eight pseudoknotted base pairs that are not
in the accepted structure.

Fig. 1. Accepted and predicted structures for M. tuberculosis RNase P. (a) The accepted structure of M. tuberculosis RNase P. (Brown, 1998). (b) The structure
predicted by TurboKnot. (c) The structure predicted by ProbKnot. (d) The structure predicted by TurboFold. Correctly predicted base pairs are shown with
thick lines, and incorrect pairs with thin lines. Figures were drawn using the XRNA program (http://ma.ucsc.edu/macenter/xma/).

compared to TurboFold is low; of the base pairs on ends of helices
predicted by TurboKnot and not TurboFold, 27.6% were correct in
all the structures. This is for cases where a helix is in common in the
predictions of TurboKnot and TurboFold. Single nucleotide bulges
are not considered to break a helix. These helices that are extended
by lbp on an end are sometimes correct, so they do increase the
sensitivity score of TurboKnot compared with TurboFold but at the
expense of PPV.

4 DISCUSSION

In the same way as the ProbKnot algorithm, TurboKnot is able
to assemble structures containing pseudoknots using base pair
probabilities. Using probabilities from TurboFold that are functions
of structural alignment and homology information in addition to
thermodynamic stability signiﬁcantly improves predictions when
considering all base pairs and when considering just pseudoknots.
Compared with TurboKnot, some methods were able to ﬁnd more

true pseudoknotted pairs on some systems. For example, meatch
found more true pseudoknotted pairs in telomerase RNA, but in the
process it predicted more than twice as many false positive pairs as
there were true pseudoknotted pairs in the accepted structures.

Single sequence methods, with or without pseudoknot—prediction
capabilities, were reported as having poor performance on the
prediction of tmRNA structure (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010).
The results with the sequences used here are consistent with
that result. TurboKnot (and TurboFold), however, show signiﬁcant
improvement for this difﬁcult class of RNAs. TurboKnot shows its
best pseudoknot—prediction capabilities on this class of RNAs, with
49% of all predicted pseudoknotted base pairs being true positives.

In contrast, Group I introns show slightly worse sensitivity
in TurboFold and TurboKnot compared with MaxExpect and
ProbKnot, although they did still have higher PPVs. This is likely
because the long insertions present in some Group I introns makes
accurate sequence alignment difﬁcult. Indeed, ILM and meatch,
which are dependent on a sequence alignment algorithm for input,
did not perform well with randomly chosen groups of sequences
from this class of RNAs. These algorithms may have more success,
however, when sequences with higher sequence similarity are used
or when using a manually curated alignment, which would allow
for more accurate sequence alignment. Such groups of sequences
are not always available.

ILM was benchmarked in a previous study using just one sequence
rather than an alignment, and, unexpectedly, it appears less accurate
when using multiple sequences as input compared with previously
reported benchmarks (Bellaousov and Mathews, 2010; Ruan et al.,
2004). This is likely because it was hindered by errors made by
the sequence alignment algorithm, which aligns sequences but
not secondary structure (Edgar, 2004). It fared much better when
given manually curated alignments based on structural homology
(Ruan et al., 2004). Because meatch, which was given the same
input sequence alignments, had similar results on similar classes
of RNAs, it is likely tools that consider both secondary structure
and alignment at the same time are necessary to accurately align
functionally similar RNAs which are not chosen to have a relatively
high sequence identity.

While TurboKnot has signiﬁcantly improved pseudoknot
prediction accuracy, more work is needed to raise the accuracy to
the current standard for non—pseudoknotted base pairs. Dirks and
Pierce (2004) report an algorithm that computes a partition function
that includes pseudoknots of some limited topologies in 0(N4) time.
This partition function could be used by TurboFold and TurboKnot
to consider a larger structure space, ideally increasing the probability
of true pseudoknots at the expense of false ones that are predicted
currently at an acceptable increase in computational expense.

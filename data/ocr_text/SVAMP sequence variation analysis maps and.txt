ABSTRACT

Summary: SVAMP is a stand-alone desktop application to visualize
genomic variants (in variant call format) in the context of geographical
metadata. Users of SVAMP are able to generate phylogenetic trees
and perform principal coordinate analysis in real time from variant call
format (VCF) and associated metadata files. Allele frequency map,
geographical map of isolates, Tajima’s D metric, single nucleotide
polymorphism density, GC and variation density are also available
for visualization in real time. We demonstrate the utility of SVAMP in
tracking a methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus outbreak from
published next-generation sequencing data across 15 countries. We
also demonstrate the scalability and accuracy of our software on 245
Plasmodium falciparum malaria isolates from three continents.

aries, user manual and example datasets are available at http://cbrc.

1 INTRODUCTION

Associating sequence variants [single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) and indels] with sample metadata such as geographical
location and drug susceptibility have played a key role in study-
ing the population structure (Manske et al., 2012), identifying
mechanisms of drug resistance (Downing et al., 2011) and track-
ing the transmission of an infectious disease (Harris et al., 2010).
With the increasing application of deep sequencing as an ap-
proach, the number and volume of population studies with
geo-biological information and associated genomic data will con-
tinue to grow. This increases the demand for tools to integrate,
visualize and analyse complex genomic epidemiological data in
real time, including browsing genome variation patterns and as-
sessing population structure or geo-phylogeny. Although soft-
ware such as Polylens (Berry et al., 2013) and GenGIS (Parks
et al., 2009) can integrate geographical and genetic sequence
data, there is a need to scale up to whole genome variation in
the standardized VCF format (Danecek et al., 2011) with inform-
ative population genetic analysis. This motivated us to develop

SVAMP, a stand-alone Qt/C++ application capable of analys-
ing variants in the context of geography and aiding in making
inferences on the population structure. SVAMP is built on the
open-source software VarB (Preston et al., 2012).

2 METHODS

Input to SVAMP software is a bundle of multisample VCF ﬁle, reference
FASTA, annotation general feature format (GFF) and a precalculated
SQLite database ﬁle. The bundle preparation script included as a part of
SVAMP software captures the geographical coordinates, date of isolation
and the genome coverage of samples. The ﬁles when loaded into SVAMP
will aid the user in performing key population genomics analysis in real
time and visualize the results. Two popular methods of analysing sample
relatedness, principal coordinate analysis [PCoA, Torgerson—Gower scal-
ing (Gower, 1966)] and geo-phylogenetic tree, are integrated into
SVAMP. The pairwise dissimilarity matrix D is ﬁrst computed based
on the Hamming distance (Hamming, 1950) (d) between pairs of samples
(1', j) using equation

L
dam = 1/L2 [5,]. 7A 5,1}
k=1

where k is the index of the genomic position out of L considered pos-
itions. Siak is the genotype called by sample 1' at position k in the genome.
Positions that have missing genotype information are ignored in the com-
putation; therefore, the multisample VCF ﬁle should ideally consist of
samples and variants with reasonably complete data. The matrix D forms
the basis for subsequent PCoA and phylogenetic tree reconstruction and
consists of N (number of samples) rows and K (number of variant pos-
itions) columns.

PCoA, equivalently multidimensional scaling, is computed as per the R
function cmdscalc, and the phylogenetic tree is constructed using Fitch—
Margoliash algorithm (Fitch and Margolia, 1967). The user is provided
with an option to group colours based on a known phenotype (e.g. drug
susceptibility) or a custom classiﬁcation. The ability to perform tree com-
putation using external phylogeny package is also supported by saving
alignments in a compatible format and visualizing the tree in SVAMP.
The PCoA, phylogenetic tree and exporting alignments can be performed
on multiple regions of interest within a subset of samples. Integrating
popular bam viewers such as Lookch (Manske and Kwiatkowski,
2009) to view read alignment evidence for variants is an added feature
of SVAMP.

3 RESULTS

We have evaluated the application and scalability of SVAMP
using two published datasets: (i) a bacterial population study
(Harris et al., 2010) on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus
aureus (commonly known as MRSA) and (ii) a worldwide

3.1 MRSA outbreak analysis using SVAMP

The MRSA dataset visualised in SVAMP as shown in Figure 1
contains 4310 SNP sites determined from 63 isolates obtained
from various hospitals across 15 countries, spanning a period of
>25 years. The linear phylogenetic tree constructed using SVAMP
is shown in Supplementary Figure S1, and the circular tree in
Supplementary Figure S2 is consistent with that described in the
paper by Harris et al. (2010). Supplementary Figure S3 shows the
Portuguese samples on the tree overlaid on the geographical map
displaying the year of isolation and location. Supplementary
Figure S4 shows the two European isolates DEN907 and TW20
clearly joining the Asian clade. From Supplementary Figure S 1, it
can also be observed that ﬁve isolates from Thailand S21, S24,
S39, S42 and S81 obtained from the same hospital cluster together
to form a single subclade. Colour coding the isolates based on the
country of origin allows the visualization of the geographical map
and the tree simultaneously, assisting with making genomic epi-
demiological inference.

3.2 Exploring the population structure of Malaria isolates
using SVAMP

The raw sequencing data obtained from P. falciparum diversity
study (Manske et al., 2012) were mapped using smalt, and SNPs

were called using samtools. Resulting variants were merged using
vcftools. Only coding region variants that do not fall in var, rifin
and stevor gene (the hypervariable gene families in malaria) sites
were included. After ﬁltering for quality and missing data, 26 918
SNPs were retained. This dataset consists of 245 samples from
six countries: three from Africa (AFR), two from Southeast Asia
(SEA) and Papua New Guinea (PNG). The PCoA analysis using
SVAMP in Supplementary Figure S5 clearly shows three differ-
ent clusters as three different groups AFR, SEA and PNG, as
seen in the paper by Manske et al. (2012). As expected, individual
continental PCoA analyses demonstrate separation between East
and West African samples (Supplementary Fig. S6) and between
Thailand and Cambodia samples. The commands and param-
eters used to obtain the ﬁnal dataset used in SVAMP are ex-
plained in the Supplementary Materials.

3.3 Memory and computational speed of SVAMP on
MRSA and malaria datasets

Memory usage and computational speed of SVAMP was evalu-
ated on a laptop computer with 2 cores (4 GB RAM) and on a
workstation with 12 CPU cores (96 GB RAM). The results were
averaged for both MRSA and malaria datasets and are shown in
Table 1.

CONCLUSIONS

By using the sequence variant and associated geographical infor-
mation, we believe the software SVAMP will aid greatly in ana-
lysing isolates from an outbreak, as well as predicting the
population structure in epidemiological studies.

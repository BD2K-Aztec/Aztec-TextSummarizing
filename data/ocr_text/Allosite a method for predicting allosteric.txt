ABSTRACT

Motivation: The use of allosteric modulators as preferred therapeutic
agents against classic orthosteric ligands has colossal advantages,
including higher specificity, fewer side effects and lower toxicity.
Therefore, the computational prediction of allosteric sites in proteins
is receiving increased attention in the field of drug discovery. Allosite is
a newly developed automatic tool for the prediction of allosteric sites
in proteins of interest and is now available through a web server.
Availability: The Allosite server and tutorials are freely available at

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Allostery is a fundamental process that regulates a protein’s
functional activity by means of changes in the conformation
and dynamics induced by the action of an effector at a site dis-
tinct from the active site, also termed as the allosteric site. From
the perspective of drug discovery, because allosteric sites evolved
under lower sequence-conservation pressure compared with the
evolutionarily conserved active sites, targeting allosteric sites can
provide unprecedented advantages in terms of higher speciﬁcity,
fewer side effects and lower toxicity (Nussinov et al., 2011).
Therefore, identiﬁcation of allosteric sites in proteins of interest
is a prerequisite for the development of allosteric drugs with a
wide range of chemotypes.

Thus far, several methods have been tried to detect allosteric
sites in proteins, including the geometry-based generic predictor,
‘binding leverage’, and normal mode analysis (Mitternacht et al.,
2011a, b; Panjkovich and Daura, 2012). Owing to the limited size
of the datasets in these studies, as well as the lack of knowledge
about common characteristics of allosteric sites, such methods
often suffer from an overly specialized range of applications
(Fukunaga, 1990), and therefore it is imperative to develop
novel and general methods to precisely locate allosteric sites in
proteins.

Currently, a vast array of known allosteric sites has been dis-
covered by high-throughput screening followed by X-ray

crystallography, phage display and tethering, yet most of these
discoveries are serendipitous. This reliance on serendipity can be
ascribed to the pronounced deﬁciency of understanding of the
structural characteristics of allosteric sites. With our continuous
endeavors invested in recruiting the allosteric proteins and allo-
steric sites deposited in the allosteric database (ASD) (Huang
et al., 2011), together with recent preliminary understanding of
the characteristics of allosteric proteins and modulators (Li et al.,
2013; Wang et al., 2012), we hope to lay the foundation for
exploiting a high-efﬁciency model to detect allosteric sites.

In this study, we present for the ﬁrst time a web service,
Allosite, which uses elegant algorithms such as pocket-based
analysis and support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer to predict
the location of allosteric sites in proteins. Allosite’s model uses a
rigorous selection of high-quality datasets for training and ex-
hibits a high accuracy of ~95% on the test set. More import-
antly, the prediction of novel allosteric sites for several proteins
using Allosite was experimentally supported by mutagenesis.
Thus, the prediction capability and the user-friendly interface
of this web server can be of great beneﬁt to biologists and me-
dicinal chemists by serving as a starting point for identifying the
location of allosteric sites and following allosteric drug design.

2 METHODS

Ninety crystal structures of non-redundant allosteric proteins with a reso-
lution better than 3 A were carefully extracted from ASD. By means of a
discriminated feature selection method, a subset of 21 site descriptors best
suited to delineate the characteristics of allosteric sites was selected and
the parameters in SVM were optimized. Then, the SVM model for allo-
steric site identiﬁcation was trained and tested, and a ﬁnal model was
deployed in the web server of Allosite. Detailed information about the
process of model construction is provided in the Supplementary
information.

3 RESULTS

We have extensively tested our algorithm, and the results are
summarized in the Supplementary Table S1. The accuracies of
the 5-fold cross-validation for the three training sets are all
>92%. Using the models derived from training data, the predic-
tion accuracies on test sets are all >95%, and both the sensitiv-
ities and speciﬁcities are >83%, indicating the satisfactory
prediction capability of our model in the ﬁnding of allosteric
sites. To further validate the reliability of the Allosite server in
practice, additional allosteric proteins with unknown allosteric
sites were collected from ASD (Supplementary Table S2).

chains of crucial residues supported by experimental mutagenesis in the allosteric sites are shown as stick and labeled. Detailed information is described

in the Supplementary Table S2

Allosite is capable of identifying potential allosteric sites in all
systems. In the four of ﬁve cases, we have found mutations that
affect the orthosteric functions of the proteins in the area of the
predicted allosteric sites by literature survey (Fig. 1), which give
support to the predictive results of Allosite in real applications.
In addition, the predicted allosteric site in coagulation factor IX
also could provide a useful hint to guide experimental validation
(Supplementary Table S2). Perhaps more importantly, the ﬁnd-
ings can be used to design compounds against these pockets.

3.1 Usage and output

For each job, the user can specify the proteins of interest either
with a PDB ID or by uploading PDB ﬁles under ‘Base
Structure’. After deﬁning a query protein, a ‘Job Name’ must
be set before submitting, which allows the users to locate their
queries in the ‘Job Queue’. Once the run is submitted, a unique
Job ID appears on the submission page. The users can apply this
Job ID or Job Name to track the job’s status or to access results
in the ‘Job Queue’ page of Allosite. On completion of a job, a
button labeled ‘Finished’ emerges in the ‘Job Queue’. A repre-
sentative run of an Allosite job takes 15—30 s, depending on the
size and the complexity of the input protein.

Clicking the ‘Finished’ button links to the result, which con-
tains the interactive 3D representation of the protein structure

and the pocket properties of the predicted allosteric site
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The residues of the predicted allosteric
site can be downloaded for ofﬂine analysis under the ‘Download
Results’ panel. Further, the predicted allosteric site and residues
forming the allosteric site can be accessed in a separate ﬁgure in a
Jmol applet for visual analysis by clicking the ‘Show Pocket’
button.

The Allosite Web site includes a step-by-step tutorial in the
‘Help’ page. The server requires Java and Javascript to be
enabled, and has been tested on all major web browsers.

4 CONCLUSION

The Allosite web server conveniently provides a user-friendly
interface to predict the allosteric sites of a protein structure of
interest. Furthermore, critical properties that are pertinent to
characterize the allosteric site are offered. To the best of our
knowledge, this web server is the ﬁrst of its kind and will be of
considerable value to scientists interested in allosteric drug design.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The comparative analysis of gene gain and loss rates is
critical for understanding the role of natural selection and adaptation
in shaping gene family sizes. Studying complete genome data from
closely related species allows accurate estimation of gene family
turnover rates. Current methods and software tools, however, are not
well designed for dealing with certain kinds of functional elements,
such as microRNAs or transcription factor binding sites.

Results: Here, we describe BadiRate, a new software tool to
estimate family turnover rates, as well as the number of elements
in internal phylogenetic nodes, by likelihood-based methods and
parsimony. lt implements two stochastic population models, which
provide the appropriate statistical framework for testing hypothesis,
such as lineage-specific gene family expansions or contractions. We
have assessed the accuracy of BadiRate by computer simulations,
and have also illustrated its functionality by analyzing a representative
empirical dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is generally accepted that gene and genome duplications are a
major evolutionary mechanism for generating functional innovation
(Ohno, 1970). The increasing availability of closely related genome
sequences allows an accurate analysis of gene family evolution
(Hahn et al., 2007; Sanchez—Gracia et al., 2009; Vieira and Rozas,
2010). Such studies have shown that most families are highly
dynamic and evolve under a birth—and—death (BD) process (Nei
and Rooney, 2005). Indeed, the comprehensive analysis of gene
gains and losses can provide helpful insight into the role of natural
selection and adaptation in shaping gene family size variation.

The stochastic BD model (BDM) (Hahn et al., 2005) implemented
in the programs CAFE (De Bie et al., 2006) and BEGFE (Liu et al.,
2011) allows estimating the family turnover rate 0») by maximum
likelihood (ML) and by Bayesian methods, respectively. This model,
nevertheless, has some drawbacks. First, it assumes equal BD rates,
an assumption that may not hold. Secondly, because duplications

from zero ancestral genes are not possible (zero is an absorbing state
in the probabilistic BDM), it cannot handle gene families without
elements in the phylogenetic root. These assumptions can therefore
bias the estimates of both the number of members in internal
nodes, as well as the BD rate. Two recently developed computer
programs, GLOOME (Cohen et al., 2010) and Count (Csuros,
2010), overcome these difﬁculties. Nevertheless, GLOOME can
only model presence/absence of phyletic patterns instead of size
changes, whereas Count assumes independent turnover rates for all
lineages, which precludes testing biological relevant hypothesis such
as linage—speciﬁc accelerations.

Here, we describe BadiRate, a new software tool to estimate
family turnover rates through the Gain—and—Death (GD) and the
Birth—Death—and—Innovation (BDI, also known as Birth—Death—
and—Immigration) stochastic models. The current implementation
allows modeling families of diverse functional elements, such
as microRNAs, cis—regulatory elements or coding—protein genes.
Additionally, these models provide a statistical framework for
hypothesis testing, such as family expansions/contractions in
speciﬁc lineages.

2 DESCRIPTION

BadiRate implements methods to estimate the family turnover rates
such as, gain (y), birth (,8), death (6) and innovation (L) rates.
These rates can be classiﬁed as density—dependent (BD) and density—
independent (gain and innovation). Indeed, the probability of having
a death (e. g. a gene loss Via deletion or pseudogenization) or a birth
(e. g. a gene gain by unequal crossing—over) event is proportional to
the actual family size. Conversely, the probability of having a gain
or innovation [e.g. horizontal gene transfer (HGT) or by de novo
origin of short cis—regulatory elements] event does not depend on
the actual gene number.

We have implemented two stochastic population models in
BadiRate, the EDI and the GD models (Csuros and Miklos, 2009;
Hahn et al., 2005) (for details see Supplementary Material), to
analyze the evolution of such diverse functional elements. The GD
model is especially suitable for analyzing families where members
might have a de novo origin, such as transcription factor binding
sites (TFBSs) and small non—coding RNAs (miRNAs, piRNAs, etc)
or even families exhibiting high HGT. In contrast, the BDI model is
appropriated to study gene families whose major mechanism for the
acquisition of genes is density—dependent (although it can also model
scenarios with a reduced number of HGT or de novo origin events).
BadiRate also implements a particular case of the BDI model in
which BD rates are assumed to be equal, the Lambda—Innovation

model (LI). This model is nearly equivalent to that implemented
in CAFE (except for the innovation parameter), which allows the
comparison between the two programs.

We have implemented three statistical frameworks to estimate
family turnover rates and the number of members in internal
nodes: maximum a posteriori (MAP), ML and parsimony (see
Supplementary Material). Likelihood—based methods have the
advantage of contrasting biological relevant scenarios, such as the
identiﬁcation of gene families or speciﬁc—lineages with extreme
turnover rates (Johnson and Omland, 2004). Moreover, the MAP
approach allows the incorporation of prior biological information
without a large computational cost.

BadiRate requires as input the established species phylogenetic
tree and a tab—delimited ﬁle with the family size of each species
represented in the phylogeny (see BadiRate’s documentation).

3 SIMULATION RESULTS

We assessed the accuracy of the turnover rates estimates by
computer simulations on the well—characterized l2 Drosophila
species phylogeny (Supplementary Material; Supplementary
Figures Sl, S2, S3, S4 and SS). Particularly, we benchmarked the
BadiRate ML (under the BDI, LI and GD models) and parsimony
estimates, as well as the CAFE (v2.2) ML estimates (under the
implemented BDM model).

Our results show that, in general (and as expected), the parsimony
algorithm performs worse than ML methods (Fig. 1A). Among
the ML models, the BDI method outperforms all others (LI
and CAFE), especially in cases where small—size families have
asymmetric birth/death rates, i.e. ,8>6 or vice versa (Fig. 1B;
Supplementary Figure S2). Apart from the higher accuracy of the
BDI model, which mainly results from the separate estimation
of BD rates, the LI model also outperforms CAFE even in
scenarios with a null innovation rate (Fig. 1A and C; Supplementary
Figure S3). Unlike LI and CAFE, which are particular cases of
the BDI model, the performance of the GD model is not directly
comparable to BDI. Still, our simulations show good performance
of the GD model in the analyzed scenarios (Supplementary
Figure S4).

4 EMPIRICAL RESULTS

We also illustrate the BadiRate application by analyzing the
suggested miRNA expansion in the D.willist0ni lineage (Nozawa
et al., 2010). Since the identiﬁcation of the miRNA copies in
the 11 Drosophila species was conducted by similarity based
on the available D.melan0gaster miRNA data, the identiﬁcation
of the family members is less accurate for longer divergence times.
To control for this effect, we contrasted two scenarios, one assuming
independent turnover rates in two classes of branches (in the internal
lineages leading to D.melan0gaster and in the rest of branches)
and the other incorporating a third class of turnover rates (for the
D.willist0ni lineage). The lower Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)
value of the second scenario (AIC = 15098128) compared with the
ﬁrst one (AIC=1518.3918) suggests that the D.willist0ni lineage
indeed has distinct miRNA turnover rates. We also inferred the
most likely number of miRNA elements in the internal nodes of
the Drosophila phylogeny; these ﬁgures are very similar to that
estimated in (Nozawa et al., 2010) (Supplementary Figure S6).

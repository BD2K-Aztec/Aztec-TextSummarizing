ABSTRACT

Summary: SPRINT is a software package that performs
computational multistate protein design using state-of-the-art
inference on probabilistic graphical models. The input to SPRINT is
a list of protein structures, the rotamers modeled for each structure
and the pre-calculated rotamer energies. Probabilistic inference is
performed using the belief propagation or A* algorithms, and dead-
end elimination can be applied as pre-processing. The output can
either be a list of amino acid sequences simultaneously compatible
with these structures, or probabilistic amino acid profiles compatible
with the structures. In addition, higher order (e.g. pain/vise) amino
acid probabilities can also be predicted. Finally, SPRINT also has a
module for protein side-chain prediction and single-state design.

1 INTRODUCTION

The objective of engineering a protein to perform a particular
biological function is called protein design. The design problem
is usually restricted to the search for an amino acid sequence that
assumes a target 3D structure (Kuhlman et al., 2003), presuming
that it will possess a corresponding function. This paradigm
typically assumes a ﬁxed protein backbone, and the amino acid
side chain conformations to be considered are taken from a library
of energetically favorable empirical observations termed rotamers
(Dunbrack and Karplus, 1993). Lastly, pairwise atomic energy
functions are used to assign pseudo—physical energetic values to
pairs of rotamer atoms (Gordon et al., 1999), and thus employed to
score the compatibility of a particular sequence to the structure.
Recently, researchers have moved toward more realistic modeling
of proteins in their cellular environment by generalizing the design
concept to explicitly seek sequences that adopt multiple functional
states, (Ambroggio and Kuhlman, 2006; Havranek and Harbury,
2003). We have achieved this goal by formulating protein design
using probabilistic graphical models (Fromer et al., 2010). Here, we

present the software built to this end, SPRINT (side—chain prediction
inference toolbox for multistate protein design). SPRINT accepts
as input multiple protein structures, their respective rotamers and
their pre—calculated energies. Furthermore, it is explicitly built to
provide the user with a global view of the sequence space compatible
with these multiple structures, since we have shown the signiﬁcance
of predicting both multiple low—energy sequences (Fromer and
Shifman, 2009; Fromer and Yanover, 2009) and amino acid proﬁles
(Fromer and Yanover, 2008).

2 METHODS

SPRINT is an open—source C++ software package that uses structural data
to design functional protein sequences. The probabilistic inference core
of SPRINT is based on the FastInf package (J aimovich et 01., 2010).
Protein structures are cast as probabilistic graphical models, and inference is
performed to obtain amino acid sequences compatible with the multiple input
structures (Fromer et al., 2010). Multiple sequences can be predicted using
the type—speciﬁc Best Max—Marginal First algorithm (Fromer and Yanover,
2009), and amino acid proﬁles can be calculated using the sum—product belief
propagation (BP) algorithm (Fromer and Yanover, 2008). See Figure l for
an overview of the SPRINT procedure.

3 RESULTS

SPRINT can be downloaded and installed on the user’s machine. In
addition, due to their object—oriented nature, SPRINT modules can
be extended to provide user—speciﬁc functionalities, such as atomic
energy function calculations for input PDB structures.

Figure 1 demonstrates a run of the SPRINT package on
the peroxisome proliferator—activated receptor (PPAR) interface
design problem from Fromer et al. (2010). As input, rotamer—
rotamer energies must be pre—computed (obtained here using the
RosettaDesign package; Kuhlman et al., 2003) for each protein
structure and stored in the FastInf format (see http://www.protonet
.cs.huji.ac.il/sprint/energies.php for details). The energy ﬁles, along
with the relevant rotamer lists, are the input that SPRINT uses to
construct a probabilistic graphical model. Since it has been shown
that state—of—the—art atomic energy functions can still beneﬁt from
signiﬁcant improvement (Potapov et al., 2009), we did not choose
a particular energy function to be included in the package but leave
this choice to the user, thus separating the energetic aspects of the
design process from the search process.

Fig. 1. The SPRINT input consists of a set of protein structures (e.g. 1K74.protein), their rotamer lists and pre—calculated interaction energies. These are
converted into a probabilistic graphical model (illustrated here for four positions) and a probabilistic inference algorithm is run. The user can choose to output
multiple low—energy amino acid sequences (top) or globally consistent amino acid probabilities (bottom). In this example, we demonstrate a run of SPRINT
on the interface of PPAR, where the goal is to design PPAR interface sequences compatible with binding both the retinoic acid receptor (RXR, PDB code
lK74) and another PPAR monomer (PDB code 2PRG) (Fromer et al, 2010). The SPRINT command—line options for running these examples are shown
on the arrows, and the data ﬁles can be found at http://www.protonet.cs.huji.ac.il/sprint/#examples. The extensive benchmarking results for the algorithms
implemented in the open—source SPRINT package are shown at far right; detailed lists can be found in Supplementary Tables Sl—S4.

SPRINT builds a graphical model to represent all protein
structures in the multistate design by connecting corresponding
positions in the structures and requiring that they choose the same
amino acid. In Figure 1, SPRINT will design the PPAR interface
to be optimal for binding both RXR and another PPAR monomer.
Probabilistic inference is performed using either the BP (Fromer
et al, 2010) or A>l< algorithms (Leach and Lemon, 1998), and type—
dependent dead—end elimination can be applied as pre—proces sing for
the prediction of low—energy sequences (Yanover et al, 2007). We
have previously shown that BP—based approaches outperform other
methods in predicting sequences with low energies and computing
more accurate sequence proﬁles (Fromer and Yanover, 2008, 2009);
see Figure 1, Supplementary Tables S1—S4, and accompanying
references for details.

The user can choose to predict either multiple low—energy
sequences suitable for the input protein structures, or to predict
amino acid probabilities for each position (or pair of positions).
Figure 1 shows both options, with the 10 interface sequences most
suited to bind both RXR and PPAR (top), and positional probabilities
(bottom) calculated by approximating a statistical evaluation of
all possible sequences weighted by the Boltzmann distribution of
their side—chain conformational free energies (Fromer and Yanover,
2008). In Fromer et al. (2010), it was found that the sequences
predicted to bind both targets better match evolutionary PPAR
proﬁles than those optimized to bind only one target.

To this date, we have successfully used SPRINT for numerous
single—state design problems (7 to 92 designed positions, rotamer
space 1024 to 10200, Fromer and Yanover, 2009) and hundreds of
multistate design problems (20 positions, up to three states with
combined rotamer space 10200, Fromer and Shifman, 2009), where
in all cases all amino acids were permitted at each design position.
Lastly, we note that SPRINT also has a module for protein side—chain
placement and single—state design; see web site for details.

Abstract

Summary: EpiToolKit is a virtual workbench for immunological questions with a focus on vaccine
design. It offers an array of immunoinformatics tools covering MHC genotyping, epitope and neo—
epitope prediction, epitope selection for vaccine design, and epitope assembly. In its recently
re—implemented version 2.0, EpiToolKit provides a range of new functionality and for the first time
allows combining tools into complex workflows. For inexperienced users it offers simplified inter—
faces to guide the users through the analysis of complex immunological data sets.

1 Introduction

Epitope—based vaccine design offers novel and rational ways to de—
velop vaccines based on genomic information. The design process
undergoes several steps. The first step aims at identifying antigenic
peptides (called epitopes) that induce a T—cell mediated immune re-
action after presentation on the cell surface by proteins of the major
histocompatibility complex (MHC). In the second step a subset, usu—
ally of size 10—20 epitopes, is selected forming the basis of the vac—
cine. Due to the high polymorphism within the MHC cluster, each
individual possesses a unique set of MHC alleles and therefore pre—
sents a different set of epitopes. Hence, it is not only necessary to
identify the individuals MHC genotype but also to tailor the epitope
selection to match the MHC allele restrictions of a population
(population—optimized vaccine) or that of an individual (personal—
ized vaccines). The third step of the design pipeline is concerned
with the delivery of the selected epitopes. A common strategy
concatenates the epitopes into a so—called string—of—beads polypep—
tide. The epitope order within a string—of—beads plays a crucial role

especially in degradation. Therefore it is necessary to optimize the
ordering such that the recovery probability of the epitopes is
maximal.

Since the underlying data and the interdependencies of the design
pipeline are complex and require bioinformatics tools to obtain opti—
mal results, we developed a web—based platform EpiToolKit (ETK)
to make such approaches accessible to a broader audience. ETK ex—
tends its predecessor by supporting MHC genotyping, and epitope
assembly besides epitope discovery and epitope selection. Thus, it
covers each of the described design steps and can be used for person—
alized or population—optimized vaccine development as well as for
other immunological applications (e.g. large—scale epitope predic—
tion). Additionally, functionalities such as the supported prediction
methods and input formats have been extended. Also ETK is now
based on a customized version of the open—source platform Galaxy
(Goecks et 61]., 2010), which allows a ﬂexible combination of tools
into workflows, a reliable recording and sharing of results, and the
integration with high-performance computing resources.

Fig. 1. Example Workflow for population-based vaccine design. Allele Selection allows to specify the target population represented by their MHC alleles. Allele

Frequencies then assigns frequencies to the chosen MHC alleles based on preassembled data or manually assigned frequencies. Epitope Conservation takes a
file containing multiple MSA of antigens and constructs consensus sequences for each of them and calculates conservation scores for each k-mer peptide gener-
ated from the consensus sequences. Epitope Prediction performs the epitope prediction for the specified MHC alleles and the consensus sequences. Epitope

Selection consumes the prediction results and selects a pre-defined number of epitopes under constraints for the specified target population and antigens.
Epitope Assemblyarranges the selected epitopes such that their recovery probability after proteasomal cleavage is maximal

2 Material and methods

ETK was designed to ease the use for inexperienced users but still re—
tain high ﬂexibility in combining the different tools. Under the tab
Single Tools the interfaces are simplified into several configuration
steps equipped with help texts. Under the Workﬂow tab these steps
are available as independent nodes, allowing the development of
complex workflows. All ETK tools generate two outputs: an inter—
active presentation of the results as html and an internal representa—
tion that can be used as input to other tools.

ETK integrates OptiType, a newly developed NGS—based MHC
genotyping approach that is superior in accuracy to existing meth—
ods (Szolek et al., 2014). OptiType uses integer linear programming
to simultaneously select all major MHC class I alleles comprising
the genotype and supports Exome—Seq, RNA—Seq and whole—genome
sequencing data. ETK also provides access to a collection of popular
epitope prediction tools. The available methods include
SYFPEITHI, BIMAS, SVMHC, the NetMHC family (reviewed in
Toussaint and Kohlbacher, 2009), UniTope (Toussaint et al.,
2011a), and TEPITOPEpan (Zhang et al., 2012). With Polymorphic
Epitope Prediction ETK extends epitope prediction to the incorpor—
ation of sequencing variations and is therefore vital for personalized
design approaches. This method is based on SNEP (Schuler et al.,
2005) and was extended to handle indels and frame shifts besides
single nucleotide polymorphisms. It either searches for known vari—
ations of a given protein within dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) or uses
a list of variations in vcf format. In both cases the variations are
annotated using ANNOVAR (Wang et al., 2010) to construct all
polymorphic epitopes. This pipeline can be used to identify minor
histocompatibility antigens (Feldhahn et al., 2012) or neoepitopes,
which are of high interest in cancer vaccine design (Kyzirakos et al.,
2013).

For epitope selection ETK re—implements the mathematical
framework OptiTope (reviewed in Toussaint and Kohlbacher,
2009). It determines a set of epitopes that maximizes the overall im-
munogenicity under constraints and thus the probability of inducing
a long lasting immunity. Overall immunogenicity of an epitope set is
defined as the sum over the immunogenicity of each epitope MHC
allele pair, weighted by the probability of an MHC allele to appear
in the target population or person.

The problem of epitope ordering for string—of—beads design has
been previously formulated as a traveling salesman problem
(Toussaint et al., 2011b) and is now available in ETK. Since this ap—
proach is dependent on proteasomal cleavage site predictions, ETK
offers two cleavage prediction approaches, PCM and NetChop
(reviewed in Toussaint and Kohlbacher, 2009).

3 Applications

To demonstrate ETKs capabilities, a workflow for designing popu—
lation—optimized vaccines for seasonal inﬂuenza was developed
(Fig. 1). Based on the yearly WHO recommendations a dataset con—
sisting of H1N1 and H3N2 strains was extracted from the Inﬂuenza
research database (Squires et al., 2012). Using NetMHC and default
configurations for the Epitope Selection step, 10 epitopes were se—
lected. The epitopes covered 5 out of 10 antigens and 26 out of 47
MHC alleles with a population coverage of 99.66%. On average
each epitope was predicted to bind to 14:33 MHC alleles.
According to the Immune Epitope Database (Vita et al., 2009) 10
out of 10 epitopes are known MHC binders or substrings of such
and 5 out of 10 are T—cell reactive epitopes or substrings of such.
For detailed results see Supplementary Tables 81—83.

4 Conclusion

With ETK we provide a ﬂexible and yet easy to use platform for ra—
tional vaccine design. Beyond the presented application ETK can be
used to tackle a manifold of other immunological questions and
thus should not only be valuable for applied medical but also for
basic immunological research.

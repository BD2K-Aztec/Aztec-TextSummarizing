Abstract

Motivation: A tool for reliably predicting the impact of variations on protein stability is extremely
important for both protein engineering and for understanding the effects of Mendelian and somatic
mutations in the genome. Next Generation Sequencing studies are constantly increasing the num-
ber of protein sequences. Given the huge disproportion between protein sequences and structures,
there is a need for tools suited to annotate the effect of mutations starting from protein sequence
without relying on the structure. Here, we describe INPS, a novel approach for annotating the effect
of non-synonymous mutations on the protein stability from its sequence. INPS is based on SVM
regression and it is trained to predict the thermodynamic free energy change upon single-point
variations in protein sequences.

Results: We show that INPS performs similarly to the state-of-the-art methods based on protein
structure when tested in cross-validation on a non-redundant dataset. INPS performs very well
also on a newly generated dataset consisting of a number of variations occurring in the tumor
suppressor protein p53. Our results suggest that INPS is a tool suited for computing the effect of
non-synonymous polymorphisms on protein stability when the protein structure is not available.
We also show that INPS predictions are complementary to those of the state-of-the-art, structure-
based method mCSM. When the two methods are combined, the overall prediction on the p53 set
scores significantly higher than those of the single methods.

1 Introduction

OXFORD

 

The increasing amount of data generated by the several sequencing
initiatives (Hudson et al., 2012; Stratton et al., 2012) calls for accur-
ate and reliable computational approaches to predict the impact of
mutations on the phenotype, and possibly for methods to correlate
them with diseases (Casadio et al., 201 1). More to this, the ability of
accurately predicting the impact of non-synonymous single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms (nsSNPs) on protein stability is essential for

understanding the effects of human genome variations (Lahti et al.,
2012). Several methods have been developed so far to predict the ef-
fect of nsSNPs on the protein stability. Some of them require the
knowledge of the protein structure: AUTO-MUTE (Masso and
Vaisman, 2008), CUPSAT (Parthiban et al., 2006), Dmutant (Zhou
and Zhou, 2002), FoldX (Guerois et al., 2002), Eris (Yin et al.,
2007), PoPMuSiC (Dehouck et al., 2009), SDM (Topham et al.,
1997; Worth et al., 2011), mCSM (Pires et al., 2014a) and NeEMO

(Giollo et al., 2014). Other methods are based only on protein se-
quences (iPTREE-STAB: Huang et al., 2007; MuStab: Teng et al.,
2010) or can use both protein sequences and protein structures
(I-mutant2.0: Capriotti et al., 2005; Imutant3.0 Capriotti et al.,
2008; Mupro: Cheng et al., 2006). Besides the single methods, other
approaches have been tested, such as meta-predictors (iStable: Chen
et al., 2013), filtering approaches based on the available information
about mutations in the same protein site (Wainreb et al., 2011) and
ensemble predictors (Pires et al., 2014b).

The available methods were trained under different conditions
and on different datasets. They address three different questions.
Brieﬂy, they can: (i) predict the AAG real values (in regression) upon
residue substitution, (ii) predict whether a residue substitution pro-
motes a AAG increase or decrease (two class predictors) and (iii) pre-
dict whether a mutation is stabilizing, destabilizing or not affecting
the protein stability (three class predictors). Noticeably, it is also
very difficult to find a good benchmark test set, since all the methods
have to deal with the paucity of the available experimental data.
Almost all methods are trained on data derived from the same
source: the ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006 ).

In 2010, Khan and Vihinen made a thorough evaluation of the
different methods considering them as ‘pure classifiers’ (i.e. the
methods that predicted the AAG real values were converted into
classifiers). The authors showed that the best performing methods
(I-Mutant3.0-[structure based], Dmutant and FoldX) exploit the
protein structure information (Khan and Vihinen, 2010).

Recently, Pires et al. (2014a) introduced two relevant advance-
ments when evaluating the performance of different methods. They
described: (i) a more correct way to avoid similarity between train-
ing and testing sets when adopting a cross validation procedure and
(ii) a new independent benchmark consisting of a wide range of mu-
tations occurring in the tumor suppressor protein p5 3, not present
in the original ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006). In this art-
icle, we take advantage of these efforts, and we describe INPS (a pre-
dictor of the Impact of Non-synonymous-variations on Protein
Stability), a new method that computes the AAG values of protein
variants without requiring the knowledge of the protein structure.
We show that when evolutionary information is taken into account,
INPS performances are very close to those obtained by the state-of-
the-art methods based on 3D structure, mCSM and Duet. We also
show that INPS predictions are complementary to those obtained
with mCSM (or Duet) and that their combinations, obtained by
averaging the predictions, outperform previously introduced and
combined approaches (Pires et al., 2014b).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Datasets

In this article, we adopted two previously introduced datasets for
the prediction of protein stability variations upon single point muta-
tions (Pires et al., 2014a): 52648 and P53. 52648 was originally
derived from the ProTherm database (Kumar et al., 2006) and cor-
rected by the authors of the PoPMuSiC algorithm (Dehouck et al.,
2009). The dataset comprises 2648 single-point variations in 132
different globular proteins. In this article, we adopted the two 5-fold
cross-validation procedure introduced by Pires et al., (2014a) and
the single training/testing set called ‘blind’ by the authors (Pires
et al., 2014a). The first kind of cross-validation fold, labeled as pro-
tein-fold (‘prot’), groups the variations according to their protein
origin (variations belonging to the same protein appear in the same
test set). The second type of cross-validation fold, labeled as pos-
ition-fold (‘pos’), groups variations according to their positions

along the protein sequence (multiple variations of the same protein
position are grouped together in the same test-set). The two different
ways of splitting the same non-redundant 52648 set for a 5-fold
cross-validation procedure are introduced to remove biases due to ei-
ther the presence of the same protein or of the presence of the same
protein position in both training and testing (Pires et al., 2014a). For
sake of comparison, we also report the performances of the methods
using a 5-fold cross validation made by random splitting the muta-
tions in 5 sets (‘random’). The ‘blind’ test set consists of a subset of
351 mutations extracted from the original 52648 dataset, leaving the
complement in the training set, comprising 2297 mutations.

The dataset of P5 3 variations was also introduced by Pires et al.
(2014a) as a case study, and consists of 42 variations within the
DNA binding domain of the tumor suppressor protein p5 3, whose
thermodynamic effects have previously been experimentally charac-
terized and collected by several authors (see Pires et al., 2014a and
references therein). When assessing the performances on this data-
set, our method was trained on the subset of 2643 variations ob-
tained by excluding 5 variations of P53 protein from the original
52648 dataset. This was done to remove the bias due to the presence
of the same chain into the training set.

We also introduce the thermodynamic reversibility of the muta-
tions, i.e. we consider that the inverse variation in a protein (e.g. GA
and AG) is characterized by the negative value of the experimentally
detected AAG (Capriotti et al., 2008). By this, we both recast the
thermodynamic property of the problem (AAG(A,B) = —AAG(B,A))
and balance the distribution of the available experimental measure-
ments of free energy changes (Capriotti et al., 2008).

2.2 The INPS machine learning algorithm

INPS is based on a support vector regression (SVR) as implemented
by the libsvm package (Chang et al., 2011). To reduce the number
of hyper-parameters of the SVR, we tested only the linear and the ra-
dial basis function (RBF) kernels. In both cases, we used all the de-
fault parameters of the SVR, with the exception of C and )2. For the
linear kernel, we optimized only the parameter C, which controls
the trade-off between the margin width and the classification error
on the training set. For the RBF kernel, both the values of C and y
()2 represents the inverse of the width of the RBF kernel, roughly
defining the area of inﬂuence of a support vector, Chang et al.,
201 1) were tuned using a grid search procedure.

2.3 INPS: input encoding

INPS predictor consists of a SVR trained on the 52648 dataset using
seven features of two kinds: (i) six descriptors encode the mutation
type; (ii) one descriptor encodes the evolutionary information. The
variation of residue w with m is encoded with six real numbers:

0 one input for the substitution w—>m (BL62), scored with the
Blosum62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992);

0 two inputs for the hydrophobicity of the native (Hyw) and the
mutant (Hym) residues rated with the Kyte-Doolitle scale (Kyte
and Doolittle, 1982);

0 one input to account for the mutability of the native residue
(Mb) scored with the Dayhoff mutability scale (Dayhoff et al.,
1978b

0 two inputs (MWm, MWw) representing the molecular weights
of the native and the mutant residues, respectively.

The evolutionary information is derived by analyzing the mul-
tiple sequence alignments of each query sequence obtained by run-
ning jackhmmer (Eddy, 2011) against the UNIREF90 dataset

(release September, 2014). The parameters were set to: -N 3,
-E 0.001, -domE 0.001, -incE 0.001, -incdomE 0.001. For each
query protein, its multiple sequence alignment was processed to
compute two different scores, derived from a sequence profile and a
HMM model, respectively.

Both scores are separately adopted and tested. Specifically, con-
cerning the ‘profile’ score, the evolutionary information value is
encoded by taking the difference between the wild-type (w) and the
mutant (m) residues at the position of the profile where the mutation
occurs. More formally, if P[k] [a] represents the frequency of the resi-
due a at the kth position of the sequence profile, the ‘profile’ score is
computed as P[k][w] — P[k] [m].

As an alternative (the so-called ‘HMM’ score), the evolutionary
information was encoded by means of a HMM model obtained by
running the hmmbuild program from the HMMER suite (Eddy,
1998) on the multiple sequence alignment. Both the native and the
mutated sequences are then aligned to the HMM with the
hmmsearch program and the difference of the scores is taken as an
estimation of the variation distance between the two sequences
(HMM).

3 Results

3.1 Computing the change of protein stability upon
residue substitution

For sake of clarity, we first evaluated to which extent each feature
contributes information to the problem of computing changes in AG
values upon residue substitution in the protein sequence (without
using the inverse mutations). In Table 1, we list the Pearson correl-
ation value of the various selected features with respect to the real-
valued AAGs in the 52648 set. All the selected features carry infor-
mation different from random (the P-values associated to the correl-
ation coefficients are significant). When encoding the variation type,
the Blosum62 (BL62) substitution matrix score is the feature with
the lowest correlation value, whereas the Hydrophobic difference
between mutated and wild type residues (AHy=Hym—Hyw) ap-
pears the most relevant to infer the AG difference. Among the fea-
tures encoding the evolutionary information, the HMM score is
more informative than the profile score. We trained different SVRs
(see Section 2 for details) and we adopted the more stringent 5-fold

Table 1. Pearson correlation between $2648 DDG values and se-
quence-based features

cross-validation split previously described (Pires et al., 2014a) to
evaluate the method performance as a function of the different input
features. The evaluation considered both the Pearson correlation
and the standard error between the real and the predicted AAG
values.

Table 2 lists the correlation values obtained for each different in-
put feature, after performing an optimization of the parameters on
the training set with a grid search (without using the inverse muta-
tions). In the first line (Mut) we report the correlation of the method
when only the features encoding the variation type are included
(namely, BL62+Hy+Mb+MW). In rows from two to four we
added the features encoding the evolutionary information (Profile
and HMM). When the evolutionary information is included, the
Pearson correlation coefficient values increase by ten percentage
points. The best predictor on the 52648 dataset is obtained with the
inclusion of the HMM score (line three in Table 2). We also eval-
uated the performance of the method (Mut+HMM) by excluding
step by step each of the components of the variation encoding (last
four lines in Table 2). The performance only decreases when
the hydrophobic information is not included in the input (the
Pearson correlation and the standard error fall significantly, line six
in Table 2). This finding corroborates the notion that the hydropho-
bic information is very relevant for the predictions of the AAG
values.

It is also worth mentioning that the performances of the method
(for the different input encodings) are very stable for a wide range of
SVR parameter values. Indeed, when the SVM parameters change,
the Pearson correlation in cross-validation only ranges in the inter-
val 0.50—0.52, with a corresponding standard error of 1.28—1.26
kcal/mol (see Supplementary Materials).

3.2 Inverse variations

From the thermodynamic point of view, an experimentally deter-
mined IAAGI value should hold in a protein for a variant and its re-
verse (Capriotti et al., 2008): a protein and its variant should be
endowed with the same absolute free energy change, irrespective of
the reference protein (native or variant). If this is so, we can assume
that the absolute value of free energy change is the same in going
from one molecule to the other and that what changes is only the
AAG sign. By this, given a free energy value derived experimentally

Predicted ELISE

Fig. 1. Predicted versus observed free energy changes (AAG) upon single
point variations. The predictions are obtained using the per-protein 5-fold
cross-validation on 82648 (as described by Pires et al., 2014a)

from a protein variation, we can take advantage of the previous
statement and use the inverse variation (namely, the variation that
transforms back the variant into the original protein) by considering
the value of the experimental measure with the opposite sign
(—AAG). Here we exploit this fact by testing the effect of adding the
inverse variations to the cross-validation training and/or testing sets.

In Table 3, we show the results obtained by comparing the best
performing method reported Table 2 (Mut+HMM) with its re-
trained version that includes the inverse variations in the learning
sets. It appears that the method trained by including the inverse vari-
ations performs better in terms of correlation also when evaluated
on test sets that do not contain them (Table 3, first column). When
the inverse variations are included in the test sets (Table 3, last col-
umn) the training containing both direct and inverse variations per-
forms significantly better as proven by the increase of both index
values (Pearson correlation and mean square error). This indicates
that the added (anti-symmetric) information can be helpful to stabil-
ize the method and balancing it. For this reason, INPS is the pre-
dictor version trained using ‘both’ direct and inverse variations.
However, for comparing with other predictors, we always test the
method only on the observed and experimentally detected free en-
ergy changes upon variations (direct values).

In Figure 1, we plot the cross-validation values of the 2648 ex-
perimentally detected free energy changes upon variations with re-
spect to INPS predictions (INPS is trained on both direct and inverse
AAGs). It worth noticing that simply fitting the predicted versus the

quence in the corresponding protein multiple sequence alignment

very close to 1 (Fig. 1).

3.3 Input alignment and performance

INPS relies on the multiple sequence alignment that is built to com-
pute the HMM model to derive the scores of the wild-type and
mutated sequences. This implies that we may aspect that the per-
formances can be affected by the alignment quality and size. In
Figure 2, we plot the graph of the Pearson correlation as a function
of the number of sequences aligned to build the HMM model. The
variations contained in the 52648 test set (as listed in the prot-folds
by Pires et al., 2014a) are grouped according to the number of the
aligned sequences relative to the protein whose variations are refer-
ring to. We group them in five different bins (Fig. 2), then for each
subset, we computed the Pearson correlation between the predicted
and the observed values. The figure shows that when the number of
aligned proteins is larger than 105, the performance is higher than
the average (0.53 in Table 3). On the contrary, when the number of
aligned sequences falls below 100, the performance is lower than ex-
pected (Fig. 2).

3.4 Comparison with existing methods

Recently three state-of-the-art and structure-based methods have
been described, mCSM (Pires et al., 2014a), Duet (Pires et al.,
2014b) and NeEMO (Giollo et al., 2014). Our purpose here is to
compare INPS, that is sequence based, with the best performing
structure-based methods that have been routinely outperforming
the sequence-based ones. For sake of comparison on the specific
task of predicting AAG values upon residue substitution, we focus
on the same five splitting sets of 52468 that were previously
described (Pires et al., 2014a) and are briefly introduced in Section
2. Apparently, when the split of the training set for the 5 -fold cross
validation procedure is done random (rand), per protein (prot) or
per position (pos) (Pires et al., 2014a), the stringency of the train-
ing versus testing procedure changes. The per-protein split intro-
duces less similarity in the training/testing set partition than the
per-position split, and even less when compared with the random
one. Therefore, we also tested our INPS using the same partitions
of the 52468 set, as done before (Pires et al., 2014a). In Table 4 we
show that our sequence based INPS performs as well as the

structure based mCSM adopting the same strategy for the stringent
cross validation procedure (first and second column of Table 4)
and well compares when the random split is adopted (third column
in Table 4). On the blind set, also previously introduced (Pires
et al., 2014a), INPS scores quite well when compared with the
state-of-the-art predictors (mCSM, PopMusic and Duet). This is so
even when all the methods are benchmarked on the P53 set (fifth
column in Table 4). On this set, our sequence based method
outperforms or performs similarly to all the-state-of the-art struc-
ture-based methods. IStable (Chen et al., 2013) which is a meta-
predictor that exploits the predictions of several structure-based
methods (I-Mutant2.0, AUTO-MUTE, MUPRO, POPMu5iC2.0,
CUPSAT) is not able to achieve the single-method performances of
mCSM and INPS. For the recently introduced Duet (to combine
two structure-based methods: SDM and mCSM, see Pires et al.,
2014b), the mean standard error reduces to 1.39 kcal/mol, while
correlation is still high. However, SDM and mCSM are both struc-
ture-based methods and do not include evolutionary information.
Then, we simply combined INPS with mCSM or Duet by averaging
the AAG values provided by the two tools. In these cases, the
prediction level further improves and achieves the highest perform-
ance obtained on the P53 dataset (last two lines in Table 4).

The result indicates that INPS carries a complementary and useful
information with respect to the structure-based methods.

Using the AAG sign, INPS predictions can be interpreted to iden-
tify stabilizing and destabilizing variations. Although this is not the
optimal solution to develop a classifier of stability variations, in this
task INPS performs equally well or better than the most recent
methods on the P53 dataset (See Table 15, Supplementary
Materials). In particular when the Matthews correlation coefficient
is taken into account INPS outperforms the state-of-the-art methods
(when evaluated on the P5 3 set, Table 15, supplementary materials).
Given the paucity of the available data to benchmark the different
methods using ‘real’ blind sets (in this case only 42 variations), the
results reported in our article should be considered only indicative
of how the different methods score.

In Figure 3, we plot the predicted versus the observed values of
AAG for the P5 3 dataset (dark diamonds). To highlight the ability to
predict anti-symmetrically the inverse variations we also plot the
anti-symmetric pairs in gray squares (Fig. 3). It is evident that INPS
learned the thermodynamic anti-symmetric property. The property
is equivalent to a rotation of 180° around the origin and after the ro-
tation, the dark diamonds superimpose quite well the gray squares.

In case we add the predictions of the inverse mutation the
Pearson correlation and the mean square errors become 0.80 and
1.51, respectively.

4 Discussion and conclusions

In this article, we introduce INPS, a new method only based on se-
quence information, for predicting the effect of variations on protein
stability. The novelty is that the method takes the protein sequence as
input and reaches a performance that is similar to that achieved by
adopting protein structures. Therefore, our INPS can be used in large
amount of cases in which protein structure is not available. We
showed that, thanks to the evolutionary information, in the form of
HMM, INPS performance is similar to those of the best-performing
structure-based methods. Furthermore, we showed that INPS predic-
tions are complementary to those generated by the best-performing
mCSM and Duet structure-based predictors (at least when tested on
the new p5 3 set). When mCSM or Duet are combined with INPS, by
averaging their AAG values, the overall performance significantly im-
proves. However and most importantly, we show that with INPS and
starting from the protein sequence, it is possible to obtain a reliable
prediction for inferring the effect of variations on protein stability.
This can be useful to annotate protein variants when the protein struc-
ture is not available and/or after detecting non-synonymous single nu-
cleotide polymorphisms during massive sequencing experiments.

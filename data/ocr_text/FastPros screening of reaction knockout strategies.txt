ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although constraint-based flux analysis of knockout
strains has facilitated the production of desirable metabolites in mi-
crobes, current screening methods have placed a limitation on the
number knockouts that can be simultaneously analyzed.

Results: Here, we propose a novel screening method named
FastPros. In this method, the potential of a given reaction knockout
for production of a specific metabolite is evaluated by shadow pricing
of the constraint in the flux balance analysis, which generates a
screening score to obtain candidate knockout sets. To evaluate the
performance of FastPros, we screened knockout sets to produce
each metabolite in the entire Escherichia coli metabolic network. We
found that 75% of these metabolites could be produced under bio-
mass maximization conditions by adding up to 25 reaction knockouts.
Furthermore, we demonstrated that using FastPros in tandem with
another screening method, OptKnock, could further improve target
metabolite productivity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic engineering of microbes has been successfully used for
the production of a variety of useful compounds in microbes
(Keasling, 2010; Shimizu, 2002; Stephanopoulos et al., 1998;
Zaldivar et al., 2001). Moreover, genetic modiﬁcation techniques
have enabled the disruption and ‘rewiring’ of metabolic ﬂuxes to
improve the production of target products (Atsumi et al., 2008;
Becker et al., 2011). Owing to the complexity of metabolic sys-
tems, however, achieving a desired metabolic state through gen-
etic modiﬁcation remains difﬁcult. Given that several individual
genetic modiﬁcations are often required to improve target prod-
uctivity (Becker et al., 2011; Yim et al., 2011), the selection of an
appropriate set of modiﬁcations from a large number of possible
combinations is challenging. To overcome this obstacle, tools
based on computer simulation and mathematical modeling

have been developed, which make possible screening for appro-
priate sets of genetic modiﬁcations to improve target productiv-
ity (Burgard et al., 2003; Patil et al., 2005; Tepper and Shlomi,
2010). Flux balance analysis (F BA) is a widely used method for
estimating metabolic ﬂuxes using genome-scale metabolic models
(GSMs) (Feist and Palsson, 2008; Oberhardt et al., 2009). In
F BA, metabolic ﬂuxes can be quantitatively estimated by assum-
ing a steady state metabolic system and optimization of an ob-
jective function. Maximization of biomass production ﬂux has
been generally adopted as the objective function, and it has been
demonstrated that metabolic ﬂuxes estimated by maximizing
biomass production are in agreement with experimentally ob-
tained ﬂuxes Warma and Palsson, 1994; Yoshikawa et al.,
2011). Therefore, quantitative ﬂux predictions by F BA can ac-
celerate the rational design of metabolic networks to improve the
yield of target products (Alper, et al., 2005; Park, et al, 2007).

In silica screening of genetic modiﬁcations is a widely used
application of F BA for metabolic engineering, and to date sev-
eral such algorithms have been proposed (Tomar and De, 2013;
Zomorrodi et al., 2012). These algorithms can be classiﬁed into
two categories: comprehensive screening and iterative screening.
For example, the popular comprehensive knockout screening al-
gorithm OptKnock, which has been used in both academic and
industrial settings (Fong et al., 2005; Pharkya and Maranas,
2006; Yim et al., 2011), identiﬁes the reaction knockouts that
hold the most promise for achieving the highest target produc-
tion yield among all possible sets of reaction knockouts (Burgard
et al., 2003). However, as the calculation time increases exponen-
tially as a function of the number of reaction knockouts that are
simultaneously present in the original network, the maximum
number of reaction knockouts to which this strategy can be
applied is limited.

Iterative screening for increasing the target productivity can be
carried out at relatively low computational costs. In a simple
iterative knockout screening method, the effects of all possible
single reaction knockouts on metabolic ﬂuxes are evaluated in
the ﬁrst iteration, and the reactions whose knockouts result in
the highest score (e.g. highest production yields under biomass
production maximization) are selected. In the second iteration, in
addition to the reaction knockouts selected in the ﬁrst iteration,
the effects of additional single reaction knockouts are screened.
This approach has a drawback, however, of incompletely search-
ing the knockout combinations. For example, when target pro-
duction yields under biomass maximization are used as a score

for screening, iterative screening fails to identify the combin-
ations of two knockouts that show higher production yields
only when they are disrupted simultaneously. To overcome this
drawback, several systematic screening methods have been de-
veloped, such as OptGene (Patil et al., 2005), OptFlux (Rocha
et al., 2010), Genetic Design through Local Search (GDLS) (Lun
et al., 2009) and Strength Pareto Evolutionary Algorithm (Link
et al., 2008). For example, OptGene uses a genetic algorithm to
search the vast solution space to obtain optimal knockout sets.
Using these approaches, sets of reaction knockouts that improve
the target production have been successfully identiﬁed with rela-
tively small computational costs. However, if the target produc-
tion yields are used for the screening score, it is often difﬁcult to
identify which sets of multiple knockouts cause the target pro-
duction that occurs only when the knockouts are done simultan-
eously. One possible strategy for this problem is to use a
screening score that reﬂects the potential a knockout has to in-
crease the production yields in concert with other knockouts.

In the present study, we developed a new iterative screening
algorithm, 1_7ast glgorithm of knockout screening for target
mduction based on shadow price analysis (FastPros), which
uses biomass production maximization to identify sets of meta-
bolic reactions whose simultaneous knockouts result in the pro-
duction of a target metabolite. In this algorithm, we adopted a
novel score for iterative knockout screening based on the change
in biomass production ﬂux caused by a slight increase in the
target production ﬂux, uTARGET. This value corresponds to the
shadow price of the constraint of the target-metabolite produc-
tion ﬂux in the linear programming problem. We demonstrate
that uTARGET represents the potential of target production
and increasing this value by iterative screening of the reaction
knockouts generates sets of knockouts that realize the target
production. Furthermore, we show that combining F astPros
with another tool, OptKnock, provides further improvement of
the target production.

2 METHODS

2.1 Genome-scale metabolic model of Escherichia coli

As an original metabolic model, we used a GSM of E.coli K-12 MG1655
named iAF1260 (Feist et al., 2007), which contains 1260 open reading
frames from the latest genome annotation and over 2000 transport and
intracellular reactions. To evaluate the production potential of each cyto-
solic metabolite in this GSM, we added a transport reaction of the target
metabolite if it was absent in the original model, which was assumed to be
diffusion transport.

To reduce the computational cost of FBA-based screening, we con-
structed simpliﬁed metabolic models based on our previous study (Ohno
et al., 2013), which provides identical ﬂux estimations and screening re-
sults to the original model. Brieﬂy, we ﬁrst identiﬁed metabolic reactions
whose maximum and minimum ﬂuxes were zero under given environ-
mental conditions by ﬂux variability analysis (Mahadevan and Schilling,
2003) and then removed these reactions from the original model to which
target metabolite transporters were added. Second, adjacent metabolic
reactions without branching were combined into a single lumped reac-
tion, as the knockout of adjacent reactions results in an identical effect on
the ﬂux changes. Third, we identiﬁed combined reactions encoded by the
same gene sets, as these reactions cannot be separately disrupted in ex-
periments. Finally, knockouts of the reactions encoded by gapA, pgk, em
and gpmA were removed from reaction sets, as their reactions appear

essential in vivo (Baba et al., 2006; Foster et al., 2010). Because the
reduced models, including lumped metabolic reactions, were used for
the knockout screening, we describe below a knockout using a represen-
tative reaction in the lumped reaction.

2.2 Flux balance analysis

Constraint-based FBA was performed based on previous studies (Ohno
et al., 2013; Orth et al., 2010; Shinfuku et al., 2009). Brieﬂy, a pseudo-
steady state of the metabolic proﬁle was assumed, i.e. the net sum of all
production and consumption metabolic ﬂuxes for each internal metabol-
ite was set to zero. This assumption resulted in a feasible space that was a
convex set in the N—dimensional space of metabolic ﬂuxes (where N
stands for the total number of ﬂuxes). In FBA, a particular objective
function written as a linear combination of ﬂuxes can be used to calculate
the optimal solution at one corner in the feasible ﬂux space. In this study,
we used the maximization of biomass production ﬂux as the objective
function. After obtaining the maximal biomass production ﬂux by linear
programming, we further maximized the production ﬂux of target me-
tabolites under ﬁxed biomass production ﬂux on the maximal value to
avoid alternative production ﬂux.

For all simulations, glucose was used as the sole carbon source, and its
uptake rate was set to 10 mmol/gDW/h. The oxygen uptake rate was set to
5mmol/gDW/h, which corresponds to a microaerobic condition, i.e. the
oxygen uptake is insufﬁcient to oxidize all NADH produced in glycolysis
and the tricarboxylic acid cycle in the electron transfer system. This rela-
tively low oxygen uptake rate was chosen, as higher production yields of
target metabolites can be obtained under these conditions, in comparison
with the higher oxygen uptake rate when carbon is mainly used to generate
biomass and C02. Other external metabolites such as C02 and NH3 were
allowed to be freely transported through the cell membrane in accordance
with a previous study (Feist et al., 2007). All calculations, including linear
programming problems, were run using GNU Linear Programming Kit
(GLPK) (www.gnu.org/software/glpk/) and MATLAB on a Windows ma-
chine with Intel Xeon 2.66 GHz processors.

2.3 u TARGET: a novel score for knockout screening

Consider the case in which the production ﬂux of a target metabolite is
zero under biomass ﬂux maximization. In this case, the increase in the
target production ﬂux from zero ﬂux brings about a decrease in the bio-
mass production ﬂux. In contrast, if the target is produced under biomass
production maximization, it corresponds to the case that an increase in
the target production ﬂux increases the biomass production ﬂux. The
change in biomass production ﬂux caused by the increase in target pro-
duction ﬂux is a useful measure to represent the potential of the target
production. In this study, we deﬁned the potential of the target produc-
tion, uTARGET, as follows:

A Vgrowth

“TARGET = ,
A Vtarget

where Avgmwth is the change in biomass production ﬂux caused by the
increase in the target production ﬂux by Avtarget from zero ﬂux. When
uTARGET is positive, the target is produced under the biomass production
maximization, whereas if it is negative, the target is not produced. Here,
the absolute value of uTARGET represents the difﬁculty of altering the sign
of this value. When uTARGET is a small negative value close to zero, a
change in its sign can be effected relatively easily by the addition of a
single reaction knockout. In contrast, when the value is large and nega-
tive, the probability of ﬁnding a reaction knockout that changes the sign
of uTARGET is small. The essence of FastPros is to use uTARGET as a score
for iterative knockout screening. Even if uTARGET of the wild-type meta-
bolic network is a large negative value, the iterative screening of single
reaction knockouts that increase this value can result in approaching a

positive uTARGET, which corresponds to target production under biomass
production maximization.

uTARGET corresponds to the shadow price of the constraint in which a
target production rate is subjected in an FBA problem. The shadow price
in a linear programming problem is deﬁned as the small change in the
objective function associated with the strengthening or relaxing of a par-
ticular constraint. Accordingly, uTARGET can be calculated using the
following linear pro gramming problem:

where M and R are the set of metabolites and reactions, respectively. vj is
the metabolic ﬂux of reaction j. vgmwth, vglc_up,ake, v02_,,pmke and vatp_ma,-,,
are the biomass production rate, the glucose uptake rate, the oxygen
uptake rate and non—growth—associated ATP maintenance requirement,
respectively. Sij is the stoichiometric coefﬁcient of metabolite i in reac-
tion j. Riﬂe, and Rm, are the set of irreversible and reversible reactions in
the metabolic model, respectively, and Rm, involves the exchange reac-
tions of available nutrients for a cell, based on a previous article (Feist
et al., 2007). bmrge, was set to 10—5 to avoid an alternative solution of
uTARGET. GUR and OUR are the maximum uptake rate of glucose and
oxygen, respectively, and were set to 10 and 5mmol/gDW/h, as described
earlier in the text. NGAM (the non—growth—associated ATP maintenance
requirement) was set to 8.39 mmol/gDW/h per a previous study (Feist
et al., 2007). @23th the minimum cell growth rate, was set to 0.05/h, as
strains with such a growth rate are anticipated to be difﬁcult to construct
experimentally. In this linear programming problem, uTARGET was calcu-
lated as the shadow price of the constraint of the target production ﬂux

(vtarget = btarget)°

2.4 Screening procedure of FastPros

The screening procedure is schematically illustrated in Supplementary
Figure S1. Starting from a reduced metabolic model of E.coli with N
possible single knockouts, the uTARGET of those networks with all possible
double reaction knockouts were calculated. Then, top P knockout sets
with regard to this score were chosen for the parent knockout sets. For
each generation, all possible single reaction knockouts were further added
to the parent sets (leading P x N knockout sets), and among these knock-
out sets that increased uTARGET from the parent sets, P knockout sets with
the largest uTARGET were selected as the parent sets of the next generation.
If uTARGET of a selected knockout set became positive or zero, this knock-
out set was excluded from the iterative screening and was stored as a
candidate knockout set for further analysis. The cycle of mutation (add-
itional single reaction knockout) and selection was continued until the
number of iterations (i.e. the number of knockouts) reached a maximum
number to obtain various sets of reaction knockouts whose additions to
the wild-type network result in positive uTARGET values. Throughout the
article, the maximum iteration number was set to 25.

The number of parent knockout sets, P, was determined heuristically.
We performed FastPros screening to obtain metabolites whose produc-
tion is predicted by adding up to 25 reaction knockouts using P : 0.5N,
P : N and P : 1.5N. We found that the number of screened metabolites
in the case of P : 0.5N was signiﬁcantly smaller than the case of P: N

(~18% metabolites screened in P : N were failed to be identiﬁed), where-
as the number of screened metabolites was the same for P: N and
P: 1.5N. The average calculation times for performing the knockout
screening of one metabolite by single Xeon CPU (2.66GHz) were 2.6,
6.2 and 11.4h for P: 0.5N, P: N and P: 1.5N, respectively. Based on
these analyses, we determined P: N is appropriate for FastPros screen-
ing using the reduced metabolic network of E.coli in this study.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Screening of knockout sets for target production

To investigate the performance of F astPros, we selected 625 me-
tabolites in the E.coli metabolic model and the screened reaction
knockout sets that result in the production of each metabolite
when the biomass production is maximized. For each target me-
tabolite, iterative screening of the reaction knockouts for increas-
ing the production was performed as described earlier in the text.
From this screening, positive or zero uTARGET values were ob-
tained for 472 (75%) of the 625 metabolites, including amino
acids, nucleic acids, lipids and cofactors by adding up to 25 re-
action knockouts to the wild-type metabolic network with each
target transporter. This result indicates that production of the
corresponding metabolites by the biomass production maximiza-
tion is possible when adding these selected knockout sets.
Figure 1 presents the distribution of the minimum number of
reaction knockouts necessary for the target metabolite produc-
tion. The list of producible metabolites and knockouts necessary
for their productions is presented in Supplementary Table S1
(available at http://www-shimizu.ist.osaka-u.ac.jp/shimizu_lab/
F astPros/).

The accuracy of the iterative screening by F astPros was eval-
uated by comparing the screening results to those obtained by
the comprehensive screening method OptKnock. Owing to the
computational cost, the maximum number of reaction knockouts
was set to 3 for OptKnock screening. Comprehensive screening
by OptKnock showed that 152 of 625 metabolites are produced
when maximizing the biomass production ﬂux by adding three or
fewer reaction knockouts. Of the 152 metabolites screened by
OptKnock, 136 metabolites were also identiﬁed under a max-
imum of 3 knockouts using our iterative screening based
on uTARGET, indicating high accuracy of F astPros screening.

The other 16 metabolites were also identiﬁed by >3 reaction
knockouts in F astPros (Supplementary Table S1). It should be
stressed that the computational time of comprehensive screening
generally increases exponentially with the number of knockouts,
and that the maximum number of knockouts is accordingly lim-
ited. In contrast, F astPros enables the screening of a larger
number of knockouts for target production with low computa-
tional cost and has an accuracy that is comparable with that of
comprehensive screening methods. In fact, our method demon-
strated that a signiﬁcant number of metabolites exist whose pro-
duction requires >10 reaction knockouts, an outcome that would
be difﬁcult to identify by comprehensive screenings.

Furthermore, we compared the screening performance of
F astPros with OptGene and GDLS, which are widely-used itera-
tive knockout screening methods. In the OptGene and GDLS
screenings, we adopted the same parameter sets used in the ori-
ginal reports (Lun et al., 2009; Patil et al., 2005) except for the
maximum numbers of knockouts. As a result, 247 and 55 me-
tabolites were identiﬁed when adding a maximum of 25 reaction
knockouts, respectively. On the other hand, using F astPros, we
successfully screened 472 metabolites. The results of these screen-
ings are presented in Supplementary Table S1. Among the 247
metabolites screened by OptGene, 244 were also screened by
F astPros, whereas all 55 metabolites screened by GDLS were
screened by F astPros. As shown in Supplementary Figure S2,
although OptGene and GDLS successfully identiﬁed knockout
sets when using a small number of reaction knockouts, they
failed when relatively large numbers of simultaneous knockouts
were necessary for the metabolite productions. This result is be-
cause the target production ﬂux, which was used as the ﬁtness
score, needs to be increased in iterative knockout screenings. The
target production ﬂux can be used for the ﬁtness score only when
the target metabolites are already produced by the wild-type net-
work or after a small number of simultaneous knockouts.
Otherwise, searching the huge number of possible knockout
sets without target production makes ﬁnding a set of knockouts
with non-zero target production extremely difﬁcult. For ex-
ample, in OptGene, the initial population of knockout sets is
usually determined randomly. If there is no set of knockouts
that result in the target production in the initial population, se-
lecting knockout sets with higher target production is effectively
impossible. In contrast, in FastPros, the use of uTARGET as the
ﬁtness score enables us to ﬁnd reaction knockouts that can po-
tentially contribute to the target production even when there are
no sets of knockouts that have the target production in the initial
population.

3.2 Improvement of target production yield by using
FastPros and OptKnock

Although F astPros provides sets of reaction knockout candi-
dates as described earlier, these knockout sets did not always
result in the desired high production yield of target metabolites
required for engineering metabolic design. The sign of uTARGET
represents only whether the production of a target metabolite is
beneﬁcial for growth and the absolute value of this score does
not correspond to its productivity. Therefore, iterative screening
using uTARGET is insufﬁcient for identifying the reaction knock-
outs that cause high-target productivity.

Therefore, we proposed an alternative algorithm for knockout
screening for high-target production using both F astPros and
OptKnock. As mentioned earlier in the text, iterative screening
using uTARGET generates sets of reaction knockouts that increase
the score to a positive value. It was anticipated that these
screened reaction knockouts have a relatively large impact on
the metabolic ﬂuxes changing toward production of the target.
Accordingly, to obtain a set of reaction knockouts resulting in an
optimal yield of a target metabolite, it is appropriate to search
for an optimal combination of knockouts from those screened
based on uTARGET values. To obtain such a combination, we used
the OptKnock algorithm, in which candidates of reaction knock-
outs were restricted to those obtained in the F astPros screening.
Various sets of knockouts resulting in positive or zero uTARGET
values were collected, of which 30 unique reaction knockouts
that contributed to the highest production yields were used as
knockout candidates for the OptKnock screening with several
maximum numbers of knockouts (3, 5 and 10 KO). In this ana-
lysis, we considered the production of 380 target metabolites
whose productions were predicted by adding no more than 10
reaction knockouts by FastPros (Supplementary Table S2). We
found that for 106 (28%) of the target metabolites, production
yields increased by >5% of the theoretical maximum yield
(TMSO in comparison with the cases in which FastPros only
was used. For example, the production yields of succinate and
sedoheptulose 7-phosphate were predicted by F astPros only to
be 22 and 55% of the TMY, respectively, but were 74 and 79%
of TMY when using FastPros-based OptKnock screening
(Figure 2A and B). In another example, the production yield
of glycerol was estimated to be 68% of the TMY by F astPros-
based OptKnock screening, but zero using OptKnock only
(Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the combination of
FastPros and OptKnock can provide appropriate sets of reaction
knockouts for high-target production yields. Moreover, the
target production yields using both FastPros and OptKnock
compared favorably with those using OptGene or GDLS
(Supplementary Fig. S3), indicating the proposed approach can
be an alternative to the other knockout screening methods.

FastPros: knockout screening for metabolic engineering

 

3.3 Examples of knockout screening by FastPros

Geranyl diphosphate (GPP) can be biologically converted into
geraniol, which is an aromatic material commonly used in per-
fume. GPP is also an intermediate in a terpenoid biosynthesis
pathway (the non-mevalonate pathway). Accordingly, reaction
knockouts that increase the biosynthesis ﬂux toward GPP can
increase the production of terpenoids in E.coli. Therefore, the
design of appropriate metabolic networks for GPP production
is valuable for engineering applications. We performed F astPros
screening for GPP production and identiﬁed 88 sets of reaction
knockouts that resulted in the production of GPP when biomass
production was maximized. These knockout sets contained 25
unique reactions that were selected for the OptKnock screening
(Supplementary Table S3). Knockouts of seven reactions re-
sulted in the highest yield of GPP, 0.34 g/g-glucose (53.3% of
TMSO. Figure 3A and B shows the estimated ﬂux proﬁles of
wild type and of the identiﬁed knockouts, respectively. The pro-
duction of GPP from glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and pyruvate
as precursors requires the reducing power of NADH and
NADPH. Therefore, competing NADH and NADPH oxidiza-
tion pathways, such as ethanol and lactate production pathways,
were mainly disrupted for GPP production (see details in
Supplementary Material).

L-Phenylalanine (L-Phe) is an aromatic amino acid with many
applications in the food and pharmaceutical industries, such as
aspartame. Because chemical synthesis of L-Phe generates ra-
cemic mixtures of D- and L-Phe, the production of pure L-Phe
in bioprocesses is important. E.coli contains a natural L-Phe bio-
synthetic pathway that has been used in commercial production.
We performed FastPros screening and identiﬁed 57 knockout
sets for the production of L-Phe, including 44 unique reactions.
Of these, 30 reactions contributing higher production yields were
selected for OptKnock screening (Supplementary Table S4).
A production yield of 0.27 g/g-glucose (58.0% of TMY) was esti-
mated for the knockout of 10 reactions. Figure 3C shows the
estimated ﬂux proﬁle of the obtained L-Phe production network.

One mole of L-Phe is synthesized from 2mol of phosphoenolpyr-
uvate (PEP) in glycolysis and lmol of erythrose 4-phosphate
(E4P) in the pentose phosphate pathway. Accordingly, reactions
that convert PEP or other metabolites in upper glycolysis into
pyruvate were knocked out, enhancing the carbon ﬂow from
PEP and E4P to L-Phe (see details in Supplementary Material).

3.4 Similarity of knocked out reactions

The results of F astPros screening demonstrated that metabolites
often share the same reaction knockouts for their production.
Here, we analyzed the similarity of knockout candidate sets
among the target metabolites, with the aim of identifying a
common knockout set for the production of a speciﬁc class of
metabolites. The identiﬁcation of such common knockout sets
enables the design of a common parent strain, from which pro-
duction strains for various target metabolites can be generated
by adding a variety of additional reaction knockouts to the
parent strain.

Figure 4 illustrates a dendrogram of the production targets, in
which the similarity between two targets has been calculated
by the membership-based J accard similarity coefﬁcient
(Levanodowsky and Winter, 1971) of the reaction knockouts
sets obtained by FastPros-based OptKnock screening. It can
be seen that several clusters of metabolites exist, and we found
that metabolites belonging to a same cluster tend to be close in
the metabolic network (see Supplementary Table S5). For ex-
ample, Cluster 1 in Figure 4 consisted of 103 metabolites, most
of which were lipids or their derivatives such as decanoate, phos-
phatidylglycerol and GPP. In this cluster, knockouts of the alco-
hol dehydrogenase (ADH), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH),
methylglyoxal synthase (MGS), and PEP carboxylase (PPC) re-
actions were shared among >90% of these targets, suggesting
these knockouts could be a basic strategy for the production of
metabolites (i.e. lipids and their derivatives) in this cluster.
Cluster 2 comprised 15 target metabolites, which consisted of
intermediates and derivatives of the aromatic acid biosynthesis

same metabolic class. For example, majorities of metabolites in Clusters 1, 2 and 3 are lipid and their derivatives, aromatic amino acids and precursors
and sugars and sugar phosphates, respectively. Metabolites in the same cluster share the same reaction knockouts for their production (see details in

pathway (3-dehydro-shikimate, L—Phe, etc.), and knockouts of
PPC, pyruvate carboxylase, MGS and phosphoglycerate de-
hydrogenase were shared by the metabolites in this cluster.
Cluster 3 consisted of 29 target metabolites, most of which
were sugars or sugar phosphates, the production of which
shared knockouts of PPC, pyruvate kinase, phosphoglycerate
dehydrogenase and glucose 6-phosphate dehydrogenase. The de-
tailed mechanisms to produce the metabolites in Clusters 1, 2 and
3 are discussed in the Supplementary Material.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a novel algorithm, F astPros, to screen sets of
reaction knockouts that produce target metabolites. We used a
screening score, uTARGET, which is calculated as a shadow price in
a linear programming problem, to evaluate the potential of target
production under the condition of biomass production maximiza-
tion. It should be stressed that F astPros enables us to identify
reaction knockout sets with a large number of reactions, which
has hitherto been difﬁcult to achieve by both comprehensive and
iterative screening methods. We conﬁrmed that F astPros has sig-
niﬁcant advantages for screening knockout sets to the widely used
methods OptGene and GDLS (Supplementary Fig. S2). We
expect that the use of F astPros will greatly accelerate computer-
aided metabolic design for industrial bioproductions.

The F astPros screening method we have proposed can be used
in collaboration with other in silico methods for metabolic engin-
eering, for example, for the production of non-native metabolites.
Although in this study we considered only the screening of reac-
tion knockouts from a wild-type metabolic network, FastPros
screening would be applicable, for example, after the addition of
heterologous reaction pathways to produce desired non-native
targets (Chatsurachai et al., 2012; Cho et al., 2010; Pharkya
et al., 2004). The combinatorial use of F astPros and other net-
work-expansion algorithms enables us to design appropriate
metabolic networks for non-native metabolite productions. As
another example, metabolic networks designed by F astPros
screening can be used as initial conditions for other network-
design algorithms, such as OptKnock and OptStrain (Pharkya

et al., 2004). Knockout sets leading to higher target productivities
can effectively prune suboptimal solutions, thereby reducing com-
putation time to identify the global optimal solution in compre-
hensive screenings (Kim et al., 2011). Moreover, some previous
reports have successfully incorporated the effect of gene upregu-
lations for target metabolite productions (Kim and Reed, 2010;
Pharkya and Maranas, 2006). This strategy for the evaluation of
gene upregulation can be integrated into F astPros analysis, which
enables us to screen sets of gene manipulations, including both
gene deletions and upregulations, to realize target metabolite pre-
diction with high productivity.

Although F astPros is based on reaction knockouts, we also
considered gene deletions. As mentioned in Section 2, reactions
encoded by the same gene sets in a reduced model are knocked out
simultaneously (e. g. two transketolase reactions are knocked out
at once, as they both are encoded by the same tktA and tktB gene
sets), which avoids cases where only a part of the reactions
encoded by the same gene sets is disrupted in silico. By considering
the relationship between metabolic reactions and genes encoding
corresponding enzymes, we can develop strategies for gene ma-
nipulation using in silico screening by F astPros.

The algorithm of F astPros is based on the assumption of bio-
mass production maximization, that is, that metabolic ﬂuxes are
organized to achieve an optimal proﬁle for cellular growth. Of
course, this assumption is not always the case experimentally. If a
strain after the predicted reaction knockouts cannot be obtained
due to no or slow growth, screening should be performed again
with consideration of lethal or growth-defect knockouts. The in-
tegration of data on synthetic lethality (Typas et al., 2008) to
F astPros screening might facilitate avoiding mismatches between
predicted growth and experimental results. Setting larger growth
thresholds in F astPros can also help avoid mutant strains that
have growth defects. An alternative way to avoid growth defects
is to use an appropriate selection score, which ensures the cell
growth. For example, the Biomass-Product Coupled Yield is cal-
culated as a product of production yield and cell growth yield
(Patil et al., 2005). Using Biomass-Product Coupled Yield as the
selection score in the FastPros analysis, we can expect to obtain
knockout sets that result in both the target production and active

growth. Even if a strain after the predicted reaction knockouts is
successfully constructed, it can remain in a non-optimal metabolic
state. Conﬂicts between experiments and in silica predictions can
be eliminated by experimental evolution. Several studies have
demonstrated that when a microorganism strain is cultured for
an extended period to select individuals with optimized growth
under a given condition, the realized ﬂux proﬁle gradually
approaches the calculated optimal ﬂux proﬁle (F ong et al.,
2005; Lewis et al., 2010). The combination of in silica screening
and experimental evolution that achieves an optimal ﬂux proﬁle
experimentally is a potentially practical application for obtaining
valuable strains for bioproduction.

In conclusion, we have developed a novel computational al-
gorithm, F astPros, that accelerates microbial strain improvement
and have demonstrated the applicability of F astPros to cell-wide
metabolite productions in E.cali. uTARGET was adopted as the
screening score to identify those reaction knockouts that have
greater potential for target metabolite production. This score
could be readily calculated as a shadow price in modiﬁed FBA
simulations. We identiﬁed numerous metabolites in E.cali whose
production was enhanced under biomass production maximiza-
tion only when multiple reactions were simultaneously knocked
out. We expect that our algorithm and the concept of uTARGET
will improve metabolic engineering technologies and facilitate
biological production of a broad range of valuable chemicals.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present a tool called MRSD (Metabolic Route Search
and Design) to search and design routes based on the weighted
compound transform diagraph. The search submodule returns routes
between a source and product compound within seconds in the
network of one or multiple organisms based on data from KEGG. The
design submodule designs a route from an appointed compound in
an interactive mode. The two complementary functions, Metabolic
Route Search and Design, can be broadly used in biosynthesis,
bio-pharmaceuticals and the other related fields.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advent of post—genomic era and increasing use of
computational techniques, great development has taken place
in computational prediction in metabolic pathways which has
numerous applications in systems biology and synthetic biology, for
example, the design of tracer or knockout experiments (Blum and
Kohlbacher, 2008). The primary method adopted by current tools for
studying the metabolic pathways is to use the traditional algorithms
of paths searching to compute the metabolic routes. Related works
include Rahnuma (Mithani et al., 2009), MetaRoute (Blum and
Kohlbacher, 2008), Pathway Hunter Tool (Rahman et al., 2005),
FMM (Chou et al., 2009) and so on. Unlike previous methods, our
application takes into account the relative conservation of reactions
that can be measured by the reaction’s frequency which is equals to
the number of organisms that the reaction exists. Also, these tools
either have no intermediates constraint or do not give a global and
visual view of the search result. Furthermore, the user may want to
design a route manually when there is no route to fulﬁl his needs in
the search results; unfortunately, there are currently no tools provide
such function, including the tools mentioned above.

Here, we described a tool called MRSD (Metabolic Route Search
and Design) for searching and designing the metabolic routes based
on the different organisms’ metabolic networks in KEGG. The
search function enables users to perform route search in a weighted

compound transforming graph in which the weight of the edge is a
relevance function about the reaction’s frequency (Supplementary
Material), in single organisms or groups of organisms with several
constraints (such as using the intermediate metabolites or not). The
new metabolic routes in the search results can be broadly used in
synthetic biology. The design function can be employed when there
is no metabolic route that satisﬁed the users’ need in the results
computed by search function, or in another situation that the user
only knows or only cares for the metabolic route from a speciﬁc
source or end up with a speciﬁc product compound. The design
function, which produces user’s interested routes in an interactive
mode, can be used in biopharmaceuticals and other related ﬁelds.

2 METHODS

The MRSD functions based on the compound transforming graph which is
a weighted digraph representing a metabolic network. The vertices in the
graph represent the compounds, and the edges are the reactions connecting
the substrates and products of the reactions. The head vertex acts as substrate
in the reaction represented by the edge and the tail vertex acts as product.
In this graph, one edge may represent various reactions because different
reactions may have the same subset of reactants and products. In the graph
of an individual organism, the weight of each edge is equal to the sum of
frequencies of reactions that produce the corresponding product with the
reactant. For a combined graph of various organisms, the weight of each
edge is the sum frequencies of that in these organisms without regard to the
duplicate of the reactions which may exits in more than one organism. The
reason for this strategy is that we consider these reactions which exist in
most of organisms have higher priorities than the others which only appear
in few organisms.

MRSD contains two major functions: MRS (Metabolic Route Search)
and MRD (Metabolic Route Design). On one hand, if you want to produce
a known product from a known source, then the MRS can be employed.
On the other hand, if only one metabolite is known and you want to know
how to produce this metabolite or which metabolites can be produced by
this one, then the MRD can be used in this situation. In addition, if the result
routes of MRS do not fulﬁl your needs exactly, you can use MRD to design
a route to introduce some minority modiﬁes on the routes provided by MRS,
which means that you can optimize the route by MRD according to the routes
computed by MRS (Supplementary Material).

MRS computes pathways between the source metabolite and the product
metabolite by performing the k—shortest algorithm (Eppstein, 1998) on the
weighted compound transform graph. MRS ﬁnds these shortest routes with
maximum weight. Under these constraints, we convert the weighted graph to
a probability weighted graph in which the edge with higher weight gets lower
value in order to satisﬁed Eppstein’s algorithm (Supplementary Material).
The result routes are a connected sequence of distinct reactions in which the
product of one reaction acts as a substrate in the next reaction.

MRD designs a route in an interactive mode according to the
assigned metabolite and the users’ choices. All the corresponding candidate
metabolites are provided by MRD based on the user—preferred compound in
each step. The computation of the candidates can be introduced to ﬁnd the
neighbour nodes of the current compound in the compound transfer graph.

3 APPLICATIONS

3.1 MRS

The main application of the MRS is exploring the appointed
metabolic network for all routes transforming the source metabolite
to the product metabolite, which can be extensively used in synthetic
biology and other related ﬁelds.

There are several settings to be deﬁned before starting a search:
the source metabolite, product metabolite and the selected networks
are required; and the remaining settings including whether the
search using the intermediate metabolites or not are optional. The
user can specify a list of intermediate metabolites separated by
vertical line. The user can perform a route search on the metabolic
network of one bacterium or on the combined network of a group
of bacteria. Furthermore, it is possible for the user to search all
routes in the super bacteria’ of the KEGG bacteria database. The
‘super bacteria’ is a virtual bacterium which is combined from all
the bacteria in the KEGG bacteria database and contains all the
reactions and compounds in this database. The user can also search
the chemosynthesis route between two compounds represented by
InChi string (Supplementary Material) by changing the interface
type.

We perform a search on the metabolic network of the ‘super—
bacteria’ to ﬁnd a route from glucose to l—butanol (Atsumi et al.,
2008). This is an interesting and useful route, which can facilitate
strain improvement for speciﬁcity and productivity, as its production
l—butanol offers many advantages as a substitute for gasoline
because of higher energy content and higher hydrophobicity. We
just reset the maximum number of routes to 30 and leave other
constraints blank to use the default values. As shown in the
Figure 1 (A2), the relevant routes from source compound to product
compound construct a complex metabolic network. We also noticed
that the highlighted route is exactly in accordance with the route
designed by Atsumi. Except the route mentioned above, MRS also
provides other routes that may be more interesting and useful for
researchers.

3.2 MRD

Consider you only know a product (source) compound and you
want to design a metabolic route that ends with (starts from) this
compound; in this case you may ﬁnd it useful to employ the MRD. A
user can enter a query compound into the MRD by name, KEGG ID,
formula, directly paste or enter an InChi string. The MRD provides
all possible candidates in KEGG according to the input compound.
The user can choose any of the predicted products to continue the
prediction recurrently. If there are no candidates available or the user
has found the route he wanted, the process ends.

As an example, we design a route to produce succinate. After
we set the product compound and the design direction, the system
provides all possible candidates compound which includes succinyl
coenzyme A, trans—butenedioic acid, etc. Then we select succinyl
coenzyme A and continue. Few steps later, we can get the designed

4 CONCLUSIONS

The MRSD is a user—friendly and versatile tool that can be employed
in many different applications including predicting biosynthetic
or catabolic routes, biopharmaceuticals and other related ﬁelds
through the separate or complementary use of MRS and MRD.
MRS performs a route searching in the weighted compound
transforming graph which take into account of the statistical property
of the reactions, with several constraints considered to produce
more convincible results. MRD is a new and useful tool to
assist user in designing a route interactively. MRS and MRD can
complement each other in helping researchers to continue their work
conveniently.

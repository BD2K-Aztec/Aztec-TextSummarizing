Abstract

Motivation: An important problematic of metabolomics is to identify metabolites using tandem
mass spectrometry data. Machine learning methods have been proposed recently to solve this
problem by predicting molecular fingerprint vectors and matching these fingerprints against exist—
ing molecular structure databases. In this work we propose to address the metabolite identification
problem using a structured output prediction approach. This type of approach is not limited to vec—
tor output space and can handle structured output space such as the molecule space.

Results: We use the Input Output Kernel Regression method to learn the mapping between tandem
mass spectra and molecular structures. The principle of this method is to encode the similarities in
the input (spectra) space and the similarities in the output (molecule) space using two kernel func—
tions. This method approximates the spectra—molecule mapping in two phases. The first phase
corresponds to a regression problem from the input space to the feature space associated to the
output kernel. The second phase is a preimage problem, consisting in mapping back the predicted
output feature vectors to the molecule space. We show that our approach achieves state—of—the—art
accuracy in metabolite identification. Moreover, our method has the advantage of decreasing
the running times for the training step and the test step by several orders of magnitude over the

 

preceding methods.

1 Introduction

Metabolomics is a science which concerns the study of small mol-
ecules, called metabolites, and their interactions in the cell. An im-
portant problem of metabolomics is the identification of the
metabolites present in a sample. Information on metabolites can be
obtained using tandem mass spectrometry. This technology allows
to obtain a tandem mass spectrum, also called MS/MS spectrum, by
fragmenting a compound. A MS/MS spectrum is a plot containing a
set of peaks, where each peak corresponds to a fragment. These
peaks represent the relative abundance of the different fragments,
also called intensity, in function of their mass—to—charge ratio. The
identification of the metabolite from its mass spectrum is then
needed for a more detailed biological interpretation. In general this
step consists in a research of the obtained spectrum in databases of
reference spectra, followed by an analysis by experts of the domain.

Computational approaches for interpreting and predicting MS/
MS data of small molecules date back to the 1960s (Lindsay et 61].,
1980). However, the early approaches were hampered by the unavail—
ability of large scale data on molecular structures as well as reference
spectra. The introduction of molecular structure databases such as
PubChem (Bolton et 61]., 2008) as well as open mass spectral reference
databases (da Silva et 61]., 2015 ; Horai et 61]., 2010) has in recent years
fuelled the development of novel methods. Several novel strategies
have been proposed, including simulation of mass spectra from mo-
lecular structure (Allen et 61]., 2014, 2015), combinatorial fragmenta-
tion (Heinonen et 61]., 2008; Hill and Mortishire—Smith, 2005; Ridder
et 61]., 2013; Wang et 61]., 2014; Wolf et 61]., 2010) and prediction of
molecular fingerprints (Heinonen et 61]., 2012; Shen et 61]., 2014).

Metabolite identification with IOKR

 

2014) have been proposed very recently for learning a mapping be-
tween tandem mass spectra and metabolites. These methods fall into
two general approaches. The first group of methods (Duhrkop et 61].,
2015; Heinonen et 61]., 2012; Shen et 61]., 2013, 2014) introduces an
intermediary step consisting in predicting molecular fingerprints for
the metabolites from their mass spectra using Support Vector
Machines (SVMs).

Molecular fingerprints are a standard representation for mol—
ecules, used in cheminformatics and drug discovery. They are typic—
ally represented as binary vectors, whose values indicate the
presence or absence of some molecular properties, e.g. the existence
of particular substructures in the metabolite or some physiochemical
properties. If two molecules share a large number of molecular prop—
erties they are likely to be similar in structure, which is the rationale
in using them for metabolite identification. To identify a metabolite,
the fingerprint predicted from its tandem mass spectrum is matched
against a large molecular database such as PubChem. In Shen et al.
(2014) and Duhrkop et al. (2015) fragmentation trees are computed
to model the fragmentation process of the molecules and then used
for predicting the molecular fingerprints. The other machine learn-
ing approach for metabolite identification, used by CFM-ID (Allen
et 61]., 2014, 2015), also relies on a two—step scheme, where the first
step consists in predicting the mass spectra of the candidate mol—
ecules by modeling their fragmentation processes. In the second
step, the simulated spectra of the candidate molecules are compared
with the spectrum of the test metabolite.

The goal of this work is to solve the metabolite identification
problem in a single step, using a structured prediction method.
These methods make use of structural dependencies existing among
complex outputs (e.g. the fingerprints of a molecule) to improve the
accuracy and make prediction efficiently. These methods have
achieved an improved prediction performance over methods that
predict parts of a structure independently in numerous applications.
In the literature, two main structured prediction approaches can be
distinguished. The first one models the dependencies between struc—
tured inputs and outputs using a joint feature map ¢(x, y)
(Marchand et 61]., 2014; Rousu et 61]., 2007; Su and Rousu, 2015;
Taskar et 61]., 2004; Tsochantaridis et 61]., 2004), and learns to dis—
criminate the correct structure 3) for an input x from all incorrect
output structures. The second one, called Output Kernel Regression,
consists in learning a mapping between the input set and the feature
space associated to some output kernel. A preimage problem, which
consists in mapping back the predicted output feature vectors to the
output space, is then solved. Existing Output Kernel Regression
methods are Kernel Dependency Estimation (Cortes et 61]., 2005;
Kadri et 61]., 2013; Weston et 61]., 2003), Output Kernel Trees
(Geurts et 61]., 2006) and Input Output Kernel Regression (IOKR)
(Brouard et 61]., 2011, 2015).

In this work, we show how to apply the IOKR framework for
solving the metabolite identification problem. Our method reaches
improved identification rates compared with the previous state—of—
the—art of Duhrkop et al. (2015). More importantly, though,
the IOKR framework results in vast improvements in running
times: the method is one to two orders of magnitude faster in the
prediction phase, and four orders of magnitude faster during
training.

In the following, we note X the set of input tandem mass spectra,

also known as MS/MS spectra, and 3? the set containing the 2D mo-
lecular structures corresponding to the spectra. We want to learn a
function f that maps a MS/MS spectrum x E X to its corresponding
molecular structure 3) E 3). In this problem both input and output
data are structured. Structured data refer to data having an internal
structure, for example a graph or a tree, or to data being inter—
dependent to each other. To solve this problem we use the IOKR
framework that can learn a mapping between structured inputs and
structured outputs. This framework has been introduced by Brouard
et al. (2011) to solve link prediction in the semi—supervised setting.
In Brouard et al. (2015), this approach has been extended to address
general structured output prediction problems. In this section we de—
scribe this method and explain how it can be applied to solve metab—
olite identification.

In the IOKR approach the internal structure of the output data is
encoded using a kernel function Ky : 3) x 3) —> R. A kernel function
is a positive semi—definite function that measures the similarity be—
tween two elements. Its values can be evaluated by computing scalar
products in a high—dimensional space, called the feature space. In the
case of the output kernel Ky, this writes as follows:

WM’) 6 37 X 3’, my) = (My), ¢y(y’)>;,,

where the Hilbert space 7:), is the feature space associated to Ky and
¢y : 3) —> 7:), is a feature map that maps the outputs to the output
feature space. Depending of the kernel used, for example when using
a Gaussian kernel, the feature map d5, might not be explicitly
known. We will see later that we only need to evaluate inner prod—
ucts between feature vectors for computing the solution, which is
possible using the kernel trick in the output space. This means that
the scalar products in the feature space are replaced by the kernel
values.

The spectra—metabolite mapping problem can then be decom—
posed in two tasks (see Figure 1). The first task consists in learning a
function 19 between the input set X and the Hilbert space 7:), that ap—
proximates the feature map d5. This task is called Output Kernel
Regression. The second task is a pre—image problem that requires to
learn or define a function g from f), to the output set 3). We detail
these two steps in the following subsections.

2.1 Output Kernel Regression

The values of the function 19 that we want to learn in the Output
Kernel Regression step are vectors belonging to the Hilbert space 7:),
and not scalars. IOKR uses the Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Space
(RKHS) theory devoted to vector—valued functions (Micchelli and

Fig. 1. Overview of the IOKR framework for solving the metabolite identifica-
tion problem. The mapping f between MS/MS spectra and 2D molecular
structures is learnt by approximating the output feature map (by with a func-
tion h and solving a preimage problem

Pontil, 2005 ; Senkene and Tempel’man, 1973) in order to find an ap—
propriate functional space H for searching the function 19. This theory
extends nicely the kernel methods to the problem of learning vector—
valued functions. It has been used in the literature to solve different
learning problems such as multi—task learning (Evgeniou et al., 2005),
functional regression (Kadri et al., 2010), link prediction (Brouard
et al., 201 1) and vector autoregression (Lim et al., 2014).

In this theory, a kernel ICx : X x X —> £(.7:y,.7:y) is a function
whose values are linear operators from f), to 7:3,, where f), is a gen-
eral Hilbert space. This theory does not require any assumption on
the existence of an output kernel Ky. [CC is called an operator—valued
kernel if it verifies the two following properties:

1. Vx,x’ E X, ICx(x,x’) : ICx(x’,x)*, where >l< denotes the adjoint.
ICx(x’,x)* is deﬁned as the linear operator satisfying
<Kx(x/7x)}~li7§lj>fy Z (I’ia’Cx(x/ax)*l~’j>f,= V3717?) E fy

2- Vm E N7 V{(xi7§,i)}i:1 Q X X 73727321(I’zalcx(xi=xi)§’j>fy Z 0

In the case where the dimension d of f), is finite, the kernel [CC is a
function whose values are matrices of size d X d and the kernel ma-
trix is a block matrix.

In the IOKR approach, the function 19 : X —> f), is searched in
the RKHS with reproducing kernel ICx. We denote this space H.
This means that we are searching models of the following form:

Vx E X, 19(x) = Zile(x,x,-)c,-, c,- E fy.

Let {(x,-, ¢y(yg))}f:1 Q X X f), be the set of training examples.
The function 19 is searched by minimizing a regularized optimization
problem. In this article, we chose to use the regularized least—squares
loss function in the supervised setting:

, E
argglimzﬂ ||b(xz) — mimic, + Walla, <1)
G

where 2 > 0 is a regularization parameter. A sufficiently high
enough value of 2 prevents overfitting. According to the Representer
Theorem (Micchelli and Pontil, 2005 ), the solution of this optimiza—
tion problem can be written as a linear combination of the operator—
valued kernel evaluated on the training examples:

A E
Ia(x,-) = 2,21 ICx(x,-,x,-)c,-,

where Ci, j = 1, . . . ,E, are vectors in 7:3,. By replacing this expression
in the optimization problem (1) and computing the derivative of the

optimization problem, it has been shown by Micchelli and Pontil
(2005 ) that the vectors Ci, j = 1, . . . ,E verify the following equation:

2:21 (ICx(x/'7 9C1) + lag/")Ci : 

where (3),- = 1 and 5),- = 0 for allj 7E i.
If the dimension d of the output feature space 7:), is finite, this so—
lution can be rewritten in closed form as follows:

vec(Cg) 2 (Elm + KX,)_1vec(Q>y,), (2)

where Cg : (c1, . . . , Cg) and @y, : (¢y(y1), . . . , ¢y(yg)) are two
matrices of size d X E; I gd denotes the identity matrix of size Ed >< Ed;
and KX, is the Gram matrix of the operator—valued kernel [QC on the
training set. This is a E X E block matrix, each block being of size d
X d. vec(Cg) is a column vector of length Ed obtained by stacking
the columns of the matrix Cg on top of each other. Equation (2) gen—
eralizes the solution obtained with kernel ridge regression to the
case of vector—valued functions.

2.2 Preimage step

To predict the output metabolite f(x) associated to the spectra
x E X, we must determine the pre-image of 19(x) by d5. For this, we
search the metabolite y in a set of candidates 37* that minimizes the
following criteria:

f(x) = argmin wax) — mm, <3)
yEV
As we consider that the output kernel is normalized, Equation
(3) becomes:

ﬁx) = argmax <1? (x), m)»,-
yEV
In this work, we consider operator—valued kernels of the follow—
ing form:

V(x,x’) E X X X, ICx(x,x’) : Kx(x,x’) >l< Id, (4)

where xx : X x X —> R is a scalar input kernel. We note fx the
Hilbert space associated to this kernel and Q, : X —> fx a feature
map of xx. By using this operator—valued kernel and replacing I; by
the solution given in the previous subsection, we obtain the follow—
ing solution for metabolite identification with IOKR:

A

f(x) = arggxax ¢,<y>Td>Y.<ug + man—101%, we),
ye *

where @X, : (¢x(x1), . . . , ¢x(xg)) and KX, is the Gram matrix of the
scalar kernel xx on the training set. Using the kernel trick in the out—
put space allows us to evaluate I? even in the case where the out—
put feature map d5, is not known explicitly. The solution can be

rewritten as follows:

A

f(x) = argmax (kngng + Kxn‘lkg,

yEV
KyO’bY) Kx(x17x)
where kg = and k2 : are two column
WW: 3’) MW: x)
vectors.
2.3 Kernels

In the following, we describe the pairs of kernels (Ky, xx) that we
used for solving the metabolite identification problem with IOKR.

2.3.1 Input kernels

We considered several existing mass spectral kernels for the scalar
input kernel xx (Duhrkop et al., 2015; Heinonen et al., 2012; Shen
et al., 2014). The kernels we used in this article are listed in Table 2.
Most of them are defined based on fragmentation trees (Duhrkop
et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2014). Introduced by Bocker and Rasche
(2008), fragmentation trees model the fragmentation process of a
molecule in a tree shape: nodes of this tree are molecular formulas
that correspond to the unfragmented molecule and its fragments. An
edge between two nodes indicates the existence of a fragmentation
reaction between two fragments or between the unfragmented mol—
ecule and one of its fragments. These edges are directed and corres—
pond to losses. An example of fragmentation tree is given in

Table 2. Description ofthe input kernels used in this article

Figure 2. Based on fragmentation trees, different categories of ker—
nels have been proposed, such as: loss—based kernels, node—based
kernels, path—based kernels or fragmentation tree alignment kernels.

We also used the recalibrated probability product kernel (PPKr),
which is computed on preprocessed spectra. The PPK kernel, intro-
duced by Heinonen et al. (2012), is computed from MS/MS spectra
by modeling each peak in a spectrum by a normal distribution with
two dimensions: the mass—to—charge ratio and the intensity. A spec—
trum is then modeled as a mixture of normal distributions. The PPK
kernel between two spectra is evaluated by integrating the product
between the two corresponding mixture distributions.

We learned a linear combination of these 24 input kernels using
multiple kernel learning (MKL). We used uniform MKL

(UNIMKL), which associates the same weight to each kernel. We
also applied the ALIGNF approach (Cortes et al., 2012) which ob—
tained the best performance for metabolite identification in the com-
parison performed by Shen et al. (2014). ALIGNF searches to
maximize the centered kernel alignment between the combined ker—
nel matrix and an ideal target kernel matrix Ky:

where 1 is a column vector of ones of length E. In Cortes et al.
(2012), the target kernel was defined as K : yTy in the case of sin—
gle label classification. Here we used the Gram matrix of the output
kernel Ky on the training set. The combination of kernels learned
with ALIGNF was then used for the scalar input kernel xx in IOKR.

2.3.2 Output kernels
For the output kernel, we have to define a similarity that takes into ac—
count the inherent structure of the metabolites. We compared the results
obtained using different graph kernels (path, shortest—path and graphlet
kernels) as well as kernels defined on molecular fingerprints. A molecu—
lar fingerprint is a vector encoding the structure of a molecule.
Generally the values of this vector are binary values that indicate the
presence or absence of certain molecular properties. A bit can indicate
for example the presence of a chemical atom, a type of ring, an atom
pair or a common functional group in the structure of the molecule.

We consider here the kernels that obtained the best perform—
ances, which are the kernels based on fingerprints. We used the set
of 2,765 binary molecular properties described in Duhrkop et al.
(2015). More details about these molecular properties are given in
the Supplementary Materials. In the experiments, we considered dif—
ferent type of output kernels:

c y’),
° polynomial kernel: Ky(y,y : éc(y)Tc(y’) —l— a) ,
° Gaussian kernel: Ky(y, y’) : exp(—y||c(y) — c(y’)||2),

where C(32) and C(y’) denote the molecular fingerprints of y and y’.

3 Results

We evaluated and compared our approach on a subset of 4138 MS/
MS spectra extracted from the GNPS (Global Natural Products
Social) public spectral library (https://gnps.ucsd.edu/ProteoSAFe/
libraries.jsp) in Duhrkop et al. (2015).

3.1 Protocol
The evaluation was performed using a 10—fold cross—validation (10—
CV) procedure such that all compounds having the same structure
are contained in the same fold. The input and output kernels were
centered and normalized. The regularization parameter 2 and the
parameter(s) of the output kernel were selected using leave—one—out
CV on each training fold. We used the averaged mean squared error
(MSE) as error measure for tuning these parameters. The leave—one—
out estimate of the averaged MSE was computed using the closed—
form solution proved in Brouard et al. (2015 ).

In the prediction step, the method was evaluated on 3,868 com—
pounds. For solving the pre—image step, following Duhrkop et al.

(2015 ) we assumed that all spectra have already their molecular for-
mula predicted as a preprocessing step, and we searched among the
PubChem (Bolton et al., 2008) structures having the same molecular
formula as the current target. We computed the distance between
the predicted output feature vector 1; (see Equation 3) and the
output feature vectors of all the candidates. After the pre—image
step, we ranked the candidates according to their distances to I;
(from the smallest distance value to the highest one). For the evalu—
ation, we evaluated the rank obtained by the true molecular struc—
ture among the candidate set for each test example and then we
computed the percentage of structures that have been ranked lower
than k, and this for varying k values. A test compound is said to be
correctly identified if its correct structure is ranked first in the list.

3.2 Comparison with competing methods

We compared the performances of our method with two competing
methods: FingerID (Heinonen et al., 2012) and CSI:FingerID.
Duhrkop et al. (2015) showed that CSI:FingerID improved signifi-
cantly the metabolite identification rate compared with competing
methods including CFM—ID (Allen et al., 2015), MetFrag (Wolf
et al., 2010), MAGMa (Ridder et al., 2013), MIDAS (Wang et al.,
2014) as well as FingerID—the second most accurate method in
their comparison. Both FingerID and CSI:FingerID train a SVM
classifier for each molecular property. A scoring function is then
used to compare the predicted fingerprint with the candidate finger-
prints and the candidate fingerprints are sorted correspondingly.
FingerID uses as input the PPK kernel, whereas CSI:FingerID learns
a combination of this kernel with different kernels defined on frag-
mentation trees using ALIGNF. In our experiment, we evaluated the
performances of CSI:FingerID with unit scoring and with the modi—
fied Platt score, which was shown to perform the best among the dif—
ferent scores compared by Duhrkop et al. (2015 ).

3.2.1 Identification performance

CSI:FingerID and FingerID were retrained on the 4138 GNPS spec—
tra. For all methods, the parameter(s) were tuned on the training set
using an internal 10—CV procedure. For the SVM—based approaches,
the soft margin parameter C was tuned independently for each
SVM. Table 3 shows the results obtained with IOKR, FingerID and
CSI:FingerID and the differences with the identification percentage
of CSI:FingerID modified Platt are visualized in Figure 3. We ob—
serve that IOKR with UNIMKL combined kernel and Gaussian out—

top 20, we observe that IOKR outperforms CSI:FingerID unit in all
the cases. When using a Gaussian kernel in output, IOKR improves
upon CSI:FingerID modified Platt by around 2 percentage units. We
performed statistical significance tests of the identification perform-
ance for the different approaches. These tests show that the differ—
ence between CSI:FingerID modified Platt and IOKR using a
Gaussian output kernel is very significant. The corresponding P-val-
ues are 1.8e—16 with UNIMKL combination and 8e-14 with
ALIGNF combination. A table containing all the P—values is given in
the Supplementary Materials.

3.2.2 Running times

We computed the running times of CSI:FingerID and IOKR using
the 4138 spectra from GNPS as training set and 625 spectra from
the Massbank dataset (Horai et al., 2010) as test set (see Table 4).
The running times correspond to the times that would have been ob—
tained if we were using a single core. The training times were com—
puted using fixed values for the parameters (regularization and
kernel parameters). The computation of the fragmentation trees, in—
put kernels and fingerprints was not taken into account here.
The running times for the training and the test steps are shown in
Table 4. In this table, we observe a substantial difference between
the training times obtained with these two approaches: the IOKR
method is approximately 7000 times faster to train. This can be ex—
plained by the fact that CSI:FingerID needs to train a SVM classifier
for each molecular property, this means 2765 SVMs to train in this
experiment. For the same reason, IOKR also presents smaller test
time compared with CSI:FingerID. In the case of the linear kernel,
the test running time of IOKR is smaller than when using a
Gaussian or polynomial kernel. This comes from the fact that we
can avoid kernel computations in the pre—image step for the linear
kernel by computing explicitly the output feature vectors.

3.3 Detailed evaluation of identification with IOKR
We will now analyze more in details the results obtained with our
method on the GNPS dataset.

We begin by presenting the results obtained for the different in-
put and output kernels introduced in Section 2. Figure 4 contains

Table 4. Running time evaluation

 

 

Training time Test time
CSI:FingerID 82 h 28 min 23 s 1 h 11 min 31 s
IOKR linear 42 s 1 min 15 s
IOKR polynomial 38 s 21 min 58 s
IOKR Gaussian 41 s 33 min 15 s

 

These running times were obtained by training the methods on the 4138
GNPS spectra and using 625 spectra from Massbank as test set.

the percentage of correctly identified structures (i.e. correct struc—
tures ranked top over all candidates) obtained with IOKR for the
different pairs of input and output kernels. The two last columns
correspond to the linear kernel combinations with UNIMKL and
ALIGNF. We observe that the two MKL approaches clearly improve
the results compared with the single kernels. The best performance
is obtained with the UNIMKL approach, which is performing
slightly better than ALIGNF. 30.74% of the metabolites are cor—
rectly identified with UNIMKL combined kernel. Among the indi-
vidual input kernels, tree alignment—based kernels, node—based
kernels [except Node subformula (NSF)] and the PPKr kernel obtain
the best results. At the opposite end, the loss—based kernels and
chemical element counting (CEC) are associated with low percent—
age of correct identified metabolites. Regarding output kernels, we
notice that the performance obtained with linear and polynomial
kernels are the same. This is because the optimal parameters selected
for the polynomial kernel are 0 for the offset parameter and 1 for
the degree, thus equalling linear kernel. Using Gaussian kernel seems
to slightly improve the percentage of correctly identified structures
for some input kernels, except for the root loss binary (RLB) kernel.

The averaged kernel weights learned with the ALIGNF algo—
rithm on the training folds are visualized in Figure 5 for the three
output kernels. The PPKr kernel is selected with the highest weight
by ALIGNF for the three output kernels. Consistently with Figure 4,
linear and the polynomial kernels are effectively the same. We ob—
serve that the weights are quite sparse: 14 kernels on a total of 24
are associated to a weight that is lower than 10T6. In order to ana—
lyze why these 10 particular kernels are selected by ALIGNF, we
plotted the pairwise kernel alignment scores between the input ker—
nels, as well as the alignment scores between the input and output
kernels (see in the Supplementary Materials). The first plot shows
which input kernels are similar to each other. Nine groups of kernels
can be distinguished and we notice that at least one kernel in each
group is selected by ALIGNF. The only exception is the group con—
taining the subtree kernel CSC but this might be because this input
kernel is the one having the lowest alignment score with the output
kernel. The sparsity of the kernel weights can therefore be explained
by the fact that some kernels are very similar to each other and thus
contain redundant information.

3.4 Prediction analysis

In the following, we detail the performance of the testing metabol—
ites with IOKR in function of the size of their candidate sets. For
this, we consider the best pair of kernels: UNIMKL combined kernel
in input and Gaussian kernel in output. Figure 6a shows the distri—
bution of the sizes of candidate sets, and the figure 6b represents the
percentage of correctly identified metabolites in top 1, top 10 and
above. We observe that the majority of the candidate sets contain
<1000 candidates in our dataset. For these candidate sets, 32.8% of
metabolites are identified correctly in the first position (magenta

bars) and 71.7% are within the top 10 (cyan bars). The sizes of the
candidate sets do not seem to have a strong influence on the identifi-
cation accuracy. Even for large candidate sets our method is able
to identify significant proportions of molecules within top 1 and
top 10.

We found 1203 compounds in the GNPS dataset that can be
linked to the ontological classification database ChEBI (Hastings
et al., 2013). We are interested in evaluating whether there are some
classes of compounds we can identify very well and some for which
we cannot. Due to the hierarchical nature of the ontological classifi-
cation, the classes far away from the root are very specific classes
and contain very few compounds while the classes close to the root
are very generic classes which contain too many compounds. As a
result, we restrict the attention to the classes with shortest paths of
length 7 from the root node chemical entity (ChEBI id 24431). For
those classes, we count how many compounds in the GNPS dataset
belong to them and represent the counts as the size of the points in
Figure 7. For each compound, the number of candidates and rank of
the correct compound are known, so we plot the median number of
candidates associated with the compounds in each class on the
x—axis and the proportion of cases for which we have correct com—
pounds with rank 310 on the y—axis. Notice that we only show the
classes containing at least 10 compounds.

From the Figure 7, it is clear that the number of candidates asso—
ciated with the compounds is not a major factor of the identification
results. Many classes with larger number of compounds, as shown
with larger points, have around 60% of the cases where the identifi—
cation lies within top 10. There are some classes we can identify
very well like 3-aryl—1-benzopyrans (ChEBI id: 50753), also called
isoflaz/onoids, and beterocyclic antibiotics (ChEBI id: 24531), while
some classes, shown at the bottom of the figure, contain compounds

that are more difficult to identify with our method. Among the diffi-
cult cases, there are the compounds belonging to the cyclic amide
(ChEBI id: 23443) class and to the cyanides (ChEBI id: 23424) class.
The compounds in the cyanide class contain a cyanid—anion side—
group, which corresponds to a carbon atom connected to a nitrogen
atom via a triple bond.

We also studied the differences in prediction performance be-
tween CSI:FingerID and IOKR for the different compound classes.
A detailed plot showing the differences between the numbers of
compounds better ranked by the two methods is given in the
Supplementary Materials. This plot shows that IOKR obtains better
performances than CSI:FingerID in 74% of the classes. Interestingly
IOKR presents the highest improvement for the cyanides class and
one of its child. On the opposite CSI—FingerID considerably im-
proves the performance for the compounds belonging to the betero-
cyclic antibiotics class and two of its children.

4 Discussion

In this article, we have proposed for the first time to solve the metab—
olite identification problem using a structured output prediction
method, namely IOKR. We have shown that our method improves
the metabolite identification rate comparing to competing methods
with considerable shorter running time, in practise allowing training
the models on a single computer instead of a large computing clus—
ter. In addition, the structured output approach provides a more
streamlined—and thus more easy to maintain—one—step prediction
pipeline, as opposed to two—step pipelines of CSI:FingerID and
FingerID which call for predicting and scoring fingerprints as an
intermediate step.

The size of the point is proportional to the number of compounds in GNPS
dataset that belong to that class and we only show classes with at least 10
compounds. The classes we can identify well are shown in red and the
classes we cannot are shown in blue with ChEBI id and name next to them

For future work, the most important direction is to address the
prediction of the ‘dark matter’ in metabolomics (da Silva et al.,
2015): the metabolites that fall outside the compounds in molecular
structure databases. There, we need to design better kernels and
preimage algorithms for molecular structures.

Finally, it is important to note that the recent breakthroughs in
machine learning methodologies for metabolite identification rely
heavily on the existence off community efforts building open refer-
ence databases such as GNPS and Massbank. At the same time, the
reference databases still cover a small fraction of relevant metabolite
space. Although machine learning can generalize and extrapolate be—
yond the training data, as also shown in this article, the scarceness
of training data still imposes limits on how accurate models can be
built. To really push metabolomics forward, we should widen and
make more systematic the community efforts in building and utiliz-
ing reference databases.

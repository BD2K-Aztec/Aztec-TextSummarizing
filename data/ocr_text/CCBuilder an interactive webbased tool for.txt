ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ability to accurately model protein structures at the
atomistic level underpins efforts to understand protein folding, to en-
gineer natural proteins predictably and to design proteins de novo.
Homology-based methods are well established and produce impres-
sive results. However, these are limited to structures presented by and
resolved for natural proteins. Addressing this problem more widely
and deriving truly ab initio models requires mathematical descriptions
for protein folds; the means to decorate these with natural, engineered
or de novo sequences; and methods to score the resulting models.
Results: We present CCBuilder, a web-based application that tackles
the problem for a defined but large class of protein structure, the at-
helical coiled coils. CCBuilder generates coiled-coil backbones, builds
side chains onto these frameworks and provides a range of metrics to
measure the quality of the models. Its straightforward graphical user
interface provides broad functionality that allows users to build and
assess models, in which helix geometry, coiled-coil architecture and
topology and protein sequence can be varied rapidly. We demonstrate
the utility of CCBuilder by assembling models for 653 coiled-coil struc-
tures from the PDB, which cover >96% of the known coiled-coil types,
and by generating models for rarer and de novo coiled-coil structures.
Availability and implementation: CCBuilder is freely available, with-
out registration, at http://coiledcoils.chm.bris.ac.uk/app/cc_builder/

1 INTRODUCTION

The accurate prediction and modelling of protein structures
remain key challenges in structural bioinformatics. Advances
here enable applications in protein folding, design and engineer-
ing, where sequence information needs to be translated to give
insight into protein structure, function and mutation. However,
given the degrees of freedom inherent in polypeptide chains, the
modelling of all potential structures that a sequence, even of
modest length, could adopt is intractable computationally.
Therefore, it is necessary to restrict the structural space being
searched and modelled. Currently, this is done through compara-
tive modelling (Marti-Renom et al., 2000), fold recognition
(Lobley et a]. 2009; Wu and Zhang, 2008), fragment-based

recombination (Rohl et al., 2004) or other methods of restricting
conformational space (Rooman et al., 1991; Park and Levitt,
1995; Gibbs et al., 2001).

Another route is to define the space to be searched by struc-
tural parameterization of protein folds (Bowie et al., 1991; Koga
et al., 2012; Ponder and Richards, 1987). This becomes tractable
(i) if there is a high probability that a sequence will fall into a
broad class of protein structure; and (ii) if these 3D structures
can be described mathematically to allow robust parameteriza-
tion. The or-helical coiled coil is an example of such a protein fold
where there are good broad-brush links between sequence and
the overall structural class (Delorenzi and Speed, 2002; Lupas
et al., 1991; Vincent et al., 2013). Furthermore, the backbone
architectures can be described by a small number of structural
parameters (Crick, 1953a; Offer and Sessions, 1995). Therefore,
we have developed a tool for coiled-coil structures that uses para-
metric modelling.

Coiled coils are bundles of or-helices in which component
strands wrap around each other to form rope-like super-helical
structures (Lupas and Gruber, 2005). In the simplest cases, this is
encoded by a relatively straightforward seven-residue repeating
pattern of hydrophobic (h) and polar (p) amino acids, ‘hpphppp’
Woolfson et al., 2012), often assigned abcdefg (Fig. la). This
patterning, combined with the ~3.6 residues per turn of an or-
helix, generates a hydrophobic stripe that spirals around each
helix giving the interface between the component helices (Fig.
lb). The interface is packed tightly together through so-called
‘knobs-into-holes’ (KIH) packing (Crick, 1953b) where the
‘knob’ residue on one helix projects into a ‘hole’ generated by
a constellation of four residues on the partner helix (Fig. 1c).

Despite the relatively straightforward sequence repeat and
mode of packing, complexity arises because coiled coils are not
limited to the common dimeric, trimeric and tetrameric oligo-
mers: pentamers (Malashkevich et al., 1996), a decamer (Sun
et al., 2014) and a dodecamer (Koronakis et al., 2000) are
observed in nature, while there also exist a de novo hexamer
(Zaccai et al., 2011) and an engineered heptamer (Liu et al.,
2006). Furthermore, within these gross architectures, the helices
can be arranged in parallel, antiparallel or mixed topologies, and
the assemblies can be homo- or hetero-typic (Lupas and Gruber,
2005; Testa et al., 2009; Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009). For the
lower-order assemblies (241), oligomer state is largely dictated by
the side chains that form the a/d interface (Harbury et al., 1993,
1994; Woolfson and Alber, 1995) and how they can pack

together in space. The speciﬁcation of oligomers above tetramer
is less well understood, but it is clear that more complex sequence
patterns than hpphppp are required (W oolfson et al., 2012). In
other words, we have a good understanding of how parallel
dimers, trimers and tetramers are speciﬁed by natural sequences
and how these can be made de novo; however, beyond these there
is more to learn.

Although methods are available to model coiled coils (Crick,
1953a; Offer et al., 2002; Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011), these
only generate the a-helical backbones, which severely limits the
modelling, prediction and design of coiled-coil structures. This is
because of the clear link between the make up of helix—helix
interfacing residues and coiled-coil oligomer state (Harbury

et al., 1993; Woolfson and Alber, 1995), i.e. a side-chain packing
effect, which must be captured in models.

Our aim was to improve the modelling and design of coiled-
coil sequences and structures and to develop a tool for non-
specialist to perform these tasks. While the large database of
known coiled coils has informed and allowed us to test our ap-
proach (Lupas and Gruber, 2005; Moutevelis and Woolfson,
2009; Testa et al., 2009), coiled-coil proteins present considerable
scope for generating completely de novo structures (W oolfson,
2005; Zaccai et al., 2011). This illustrates further the power and
potential of this type of structural parametric modelling.

We set out to create an application that could model as many
coiled-coil architectures and topologies as possible, that is, those

observed already in nature plus those that are theoretically pos-
sible but currently without natural precedents. To do this, we
divided the problem into two parts: ﬁrst, to generate backbone
models for the many coiled-coil structures possible; second, to ﬁt
and score sequences onto these frameworks.

CCBuilder is a web-based application that generates complete
(backbone and side chain) atomistic models of heptad-based
coiled coils in conformations speciﬁed by the user. Models are
scored for feasibility with a measure of backbone strain, a test for
KIH packing, and two atom-based forceﬁelds. A basic ‘Builder’
mode is capable of modelling homo- and hetero-oligomeric
coiled coils in parallel (up to 26 chains) and antiparallel (even
numbered chains up to 26) conformations. This covers 96.3% of
coiled coils in CC+ (Testa et al., 2009) with 350% sequence
redundancy. Furthermore, an ‘Advanced’ builder mode allows
parameters to be speciﬁed for individual or-helices around a
super-helical axis, enabling some of the remaining more unusual
coiled-coil conformations to be modelled. It also presents oppor-
tunities for building models for the many as yet unobserved, but
theoretically possible, coiled-coil structures.

2 METHODS

2.1 Application architecture

CCBuilder has three main parts: a web-based graphical user interface
(GUI), a coiled coil modelling component and a validation/scoring
method. The GUI is set up as part of a Linux, Apache, NoSQL/
MongoDB, Python/Django stack with a browser-based front end for
collecting input parameters and returning the resultant models to the
user. As models are generated server side, modelling, validation and visu-
alization can be performed on any device with a WebGL—enabled brow-
ser, including certain mobile platforms.

The GUI has a GLmol—powered molecular viewer (http://webglmol.
sourceforge.jp/index-en.html) to display the models generated (Fig. 2a).
Beside this, there are six main tabs: “Build”, “Log”, “Models”, ‘Interface’,
“Plot” and “Information”. “Build” collects input parameters and displays
model scoring. It also has a list of example models based on known
coiled-coil crystal structures (Table l) as a guide for parameter selection.
“Log” gives a detailed list of energies per residue, which is useful for
identifying clashes between side chains, as well as a full SOCKET
Malshaw and Woolfson, 2001) report to indicate if and where KIH
interactions are made. “Models” gives a history of the last 10 models
generated and allows these to be rebuilt or downloaded by the user.
“Interface” allows the interface angle—a parameter that deﬁnes the rota-
tion of helices relative to the long axis of the coiled coil (Fig. lf)—to be
set graphically, easing parameter selection. “Plot” displays a line graph of
the Rosetta and Bristol University Docking Engine (BUDE) scores for
the last 10 models generated. The “Information” tab gives a brief guide to
operation and a list of useful references.

Building a model requires basic sequence and register information
along with oligomer state and three geometric parameters: radius, pitch
and interface angle/(131, Figure ld—f. Initially, a poly-glycine model of the
oz-helical backbone is generated using Crick”s mathematical description of
a coiled coil (Crick, 1953a), as implemented in MAKECCSC (Offer and
Sessions, 1995). To generate antiparallel helices, the coordinates of spe-
ciﬁed helices are rotated around the axis deﬁned by the vector between
the centre of the antiparallel helix and the centre of the whole assembly.
This is performed using rotation matrices that are generated for each
antiparallel chain and are applied to the atomic coordinates. If a z-shift
parameter is required—which is a displacement of a helix along the length
of the super-helical axis, measured in A—helices are also rotated about,
as well as translated along, the super-helical axis. This is to maintain the

orientation of the helices relative to the assembly. The rotation angle (6°)
is calculated from the distance of z-shift (z) required and the pitch of the
assembly (P).

a:  x 360 (1)

This angle and the super-helical axis are used to generate a rotation
matrix, which is applied to the shifted strands, ensuring that these remain
in phase with the pitch of the assembly after translation.

After the backbone has been created, side chains are added onto this
frame using SCRWL 4 (Krivov et al., 2009), and the side-chain relaxation
algorithm from the Rosetta molecular modelling package as implemented
in PyRosetta (Chaudhury et al., 2010). The model is then ready for val-
idation. Three methods are applied to test model validity: a measure of
backbone strain, testing for KIH packing, and two all-atom scoring
functions.

As users are free to specify a broad range of values for input param-
eters, there is the potential to generate strained helices (i.e. helices where
geometry and hydrogen bonding are far from ideal) through using either

low or high pitch values. Rather than restrict the permitted values, a
measure of backbone strain is used to allow users the choice of what
models to accept and reject. To determine whether the backbone in the
models is strained, the number of residues per oz-helical turn (11) was
calculated, using Helanal (Bansal et al., 2000), for a set of 32 878, non-
redundant, oz-helices selected from 2417 crystal structures with a reso-
lution of better than 1.6A and sequence identity <30%. The value for
n for the model, which is extracted from MAKECCSC when the model is
generated, is returned to the user with an indication of how it compares
with the reference distribution.

Models are tested for KIH packing using SOCKET (Walshaw and
Woolfson, 2001). A full report is available in the “Log” tab detailing
which residues are involved. The cut-off distance for ﬁnding KIH packing
is 7A as default, but this can be modiﬁed via the “Build” tab. Knob
residues are highlighted in the model viewer as “sticks” compared with
the “line” representation for other residues.

Two scoring functions are applied to the ﬁnal model: Rosetta (Bradley
et al., 2005) using the standard force ﬁeld, with the “Score 12” patch; and
BUDE (McIntosh-Smith et al., 2011; Mcintosh—smith et al., 2014).
BUDE uses an empirical free-energy force ﬁeld to predict the free
energy of binding between two molecules. BUDE is a general purpose,
GPU-accelerated, molecular-docking program designed to perform vir-
tual screening, binding site identiﬁcation and protein—protein docking in
real space. Here, we have applied it to calculate binding energies between
the component chains of coiled-coil models by making minor modiﬁca-
tions to the original residue-based force ﬁeld parameters (the resulting
force ﬁeld is Bude_FF-Rl).

For CCBuilder, BUDE scores a single conformation speciﬁed by the
user during model generation. One oz-helix in the coiled coil is designated
as the “ligand”, with the other helix/helices designated as the “receptor”
before energy of binding is calculated. This is repeated for each strand in
the assembly and averaged to generate the ﬁnal score. As BUDE is de-
signed to minimize thousands of potential drug candidates, each in a
range of different conformations, the binding energy of a single conform-
ation can be evaluated in a fraction of a second, making it ideal for a web-
based application where response time contributes to overall user
experience.

2.2 Helix-building validation

To test the model-building protocol, we rebuilt a set of 594 parallel
homo-oligomeric coiled coils (oligomer state between 2 and 6 and 240
amino acids) selected from CC+, a relational database of coiled-coil
proteins (Testa et al., 2009). The parameters required to build models
of these coiled coils were extracted from the crystal structures using
TWISTER (Strelkov and Burkhard, 2002), which measures them in
three residue frames before averaging across the length of the protein.
The coordinates of the structure and the model were ﬁtted, and the
RMSD was calculated using the McLachlan algorithm (McLachlan,
1982) as implemented in the program ProFit (Martin, A.C.R., http://

www.bioinf.org.uk/software/proﬁt/). To allow for comparison between
sequences of different length, the RMSD scores were normalized using
the RMSD100 algorithm (Carugo and Pongor, 2001), where N = number
of amino acids.

CCBuilder”s antiparallel mode was tested in the same manner. A set of
59 homo-oligomeric antiparallel coiled-coil dimers, with 340 amino
acids, was modelled in CCBuilder, and RMSD values between the
model and the crystal structure calculated and normalized to
RMSD100 scores.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Residues per or-helical turn as a measure of backbone
strain

Helanal (Bansal et al., 2000) was used to determine the mean
value of n in a set of oz-helices extracted from high-resolution
structures (<1.6A) (Fig. 3a). This was found to be 3.60, which
should represent average geometry for an unstrained oz-helix.
However, the distribution was broader than expected, with a
shoulder around n = 3.3. This closely mirrors an aforementioned
distribution found in a smaller set of oz-helices (Chothia et al.,
1981), with the shoulder being attributed to segments of 310-helix
found at the ends of a-helical regions. These non—or-helical re-
gions were ﬁltered out using helix deﬁnitions from DS SP (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983) (Fig. 3b), generating a mean value of n = 3.65.
For comparison, we determined the distribution in oz-helices from
coiled coils of the CC+ database (Testa et al., 2009). For these,
the mean value was 3.62. As judged by Student’s t—test, the
two distributions were indistinguishable, t(6768) = 27.90,
P = 2.2 x 1016. Thus, models returned with n = 3.65:l:0.07
should be considered as models with good backbone geometry
for coiled coils and helical assemblies in general.

3.2 Model validation

Models were constructed based on parameters derived from
known crystal structures to test CCBuilder”s model-building
protocol. The building process was automated to produce 653
models for comparison with the corresponding crystal structure
(Table 2 and Fig. 4). We found that backbones were modelled
well, with an average RMSD100 score of <0.80 A measured over
all backbone atoms, similar to previously reported values for

backbone models (Grigoryan and Degrado, 2011). With side-
chain atoms included, the calculated models reproduced the ex-
perimental structures with a reasonable mean RMSD100 score
of 2.20 A. This value is inﬂated, especially in lower order coiled
coils, as ﬁve of seven residues of the heptad repeat—i.e. those
other than a and d—are relatively unconstrained (Fig. la). It
should follow that as oligomer state increases, more residues
become constrained as the helix—helix interfaces broaden—i.e.
to partially include those at e and g—and therefore, the averaged
RMSD100 scores should decrease. This was observed with aver-
age all-atom RMSD100 scores for dimers (250), trimers (266)
and tetramers (50) being 2.38 A, 2.13 A and 1.69 A, respectively.

On average, the RMSD100 scores were higher for the antipar-
allel models than the parallel models (Table 2). This can be
understood in that the latter required an extra parameter (the
z-shift) to describe them, leading to a larger parameter and struc-
ture space. As TWISTER (Strelkov and Burkhard, 2002) does
not measure this parameter and could not determine this a priori,
z-shifts were applied to each model individually as they were
constructed, through sequentially varying the value and scoring
the model.

for the well-characterized coiled-coil dimer from the yeast tran-
scriptional activator GCN4 (2ZTA) (Gonzalez et al., 1996), an
antiparallel dimeric coiled coil from bovine IFl (lGMJ)
(Cabezén et al., 2001), the de novo parallel hexameric coiled
coil CC-Hex (3R3K) (Zaccai et al., 2011) and a slipped engin-
eered heptameric mutant of the aforementioned GCN4 peptide
(2HY6) (Liu et al., 2006). These were selected to demonstrate a
range of different model types that CCBuilder can generate.
From these overlays, it is apparent that CCBuilder captures
the gross structural properties of the assemblies, with good align-
ment of the backbones.

As mentioned above, a possible consequence of coiled-coil
folding is that residues outside the a and d sites could be rela-
tively unconstrained (Fig. 1). That said, along with residues at
the e and g sites, it is those at a and d that contribute most to
stability and oligomer-state deﬁnition for the vast majority of
coiled-coil structures. Thus, we felt it important that these resi-
dues were modelled accurately. Of the core residues in the exam-
ined structures, the experimentally observed rotamers were
consistently selected in our models for valine and isoleucine,
and the correct leucine rotamers were reproduced well in both
dimers and the slipped heptamer. However, for CC-Hex, the
rotamers of the leucine side chains were almost all incorrectly
assigned, possibly indicating that these residues are less con-
strained in this particular structure. Interestingly, and consistent
with this, we ﬁnd that these leucine residues, which fall at a sites,

elsewhere if rotamer selection can be improved using a coiled-

4 DISCUSSION

We have described CCBuilder, a web-based interactive tool for
generating models of coiled-coil structures. The input sequences
and parameters can be taken from known examples, or can be

completely novel, allowing modelling of natural and de novo
coiled coils. For the former, CCBuilder produces models that
accurately match existing crystal structures, not just for the
common parallel dimers, trimers, tetramers and antiparallel
dimers but also for more unusual coiled-coil geometries. For
de novo coiled coils, unrestricted selection of parameters allows
the user to freely explore potential coiled-coil conformation
space, but this is only useful if there is robust model validation
to guide the users design. In CCBuilder, this is provided through
the combination of a measure of backbone strain, checking for
KIH packing and the choice of two all-atom scoring functions.

Using the number of residues per a-helical turn as a measure
of backbone strain exploits a parameter that is generated during
backbone construction at little computational cost. It also en-
sures good a-helical backbone geometry, which we ﬁnd to be
tightly deﬁned in general protein structures and coiled coils.
The KIH check, which is done rapidly on the ﬂy with
SOCKET (W alshaw and Woolfson, 2001), is important to
ensure that this signature feature of coiled coils that gives intim-
ate helix—helix packing is captured in the models.

For the ﬁnal stage of model validation, both the Rosetta and
BUDE force ﬁelds are included to offer the user a choice of
scoring method. For this application of constructing coiled-coil
bundles, however, we ﬁnd that BUDE is better suited to scoring
interactions between the component helices than the standard
Rosetta force ﬁeld. We believe that this is because of (i) the
relative hardness of atoms in the two force ﬁelds, with BUDE
being the “softer”, allowing better accommodation of minor geo-
metrical inaccuracies; and (ii) the BUDE hydrophobicity func-
tion giving a better representation of desolvation.

Both the models created for the large rebuild of known coiled-
coil structures (Table 2 and Fig. 4) and the dimeric and hexame-
ric models shown in Figure 5a—c used only the parameters
included in the “Basic” build mode. With this functionality
alone, it is possible to model >96% of known coiled-coil struc-
tures (Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009; Testa et al., 2009), which
should account for the vast majority of biologically relevant
coiled coils. It should be possible to model most of the remaining
coiled coils using the features included on the “Advanced” mode,
which allows parameters to be speciﬁed for each chain individu-
ally relative to a central helical axis. The advanced mode was
used to recreate the heptameric model (Fig. 5d), where one of the
interfaces between component helices is slipped by a heptad
(~10 A), leaving a layer of hydrophobic “core” residue unsatisﬁed
on two strands. Modelling this required systematic variation of z-
shift for each component chain. Nonetheless, the model returned
closely matched the experimental structure.

CCBuilder also allows the construction of models for coiled-
coil sequences where structural data are not available. The re-
sulting coordinate sets have potential as search models for mo-
lecular-replacement solutions for X-ray diffraction data or as
initial structures in molecular modelling and dynamics simula-
tions. Furthermore, CCBuilder could be used predictively, allow-
ing the rational design of mutants of existing coiled coils, or for
completely de novo sequences and structures. Thus, CCBuilder
should expedite the generation and visualization of models and
allow real-time reﬁnement of these via the input parameters by
the user, above and beyond what is available through any other
software currently available. The combination of measuring

backbone geometry, checking for KIH packing and all-atom
scoring functions allows the robust assessment of the feasibility
of models. Thus, we suggest that CCBuilder is the best currently
available tool for the design of coiled-coil proteins and assem-
blies that are theoretically possible, but havle yet to be observed
in nature (Woolfson et al, 2012).

ABSTRACT

Summary: We created a fast, robust and general C+ + implementa-
tion of a single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) set enrichment algo-
rithm to identify cell types, tissues and pathways affected by risk loci.
|t tests trait-associated genomic loci for enrichment of specificity to
conditions (cell types, tissues and pathways). We use a non-paramet-
ric statistical approach to compute empirical P—values by comparison
with null SNP sets. As a proof of concept, we present novel applica-
tions of our method to four sets of genome-wide significant SNPs
associated with red blood cell count, multiple sclerosis, celiac disease
and HDL cholesterol.

1 INTRODUCTION

As genome-wide association studies (GWAS) continue to ﬁnd
disease alleles, investigators seek to identify the set of pathways
and tissue types affected by these alleles, and the physiological
conditions under which they act (Elbers et al., 2009; Lango Allen
et al., 2010; Raychaudhuri, 2011; Wang et al., 2013; Yaspan and
Veatch, 2011). For example, we have previously presented
statistical methods to identify immune cell types for further func-
tional investigation by ﬁnding cell type-speciﬁc expression of
genes in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with autoimmune disease-
associated single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Hu et al.,
2011). Presumably, alleles inﬂuence disease risk through path-
ways speciﬁc to these cell types.

We sought a general implementation of these methods to
leverage data from high-throughput functional assays that
assess genome-wide transcription, protein binding, epigenetic
modiﬁcations and other functional parameters across diverse
cellular conditions and tissue types. Each of these diverse data
types can be represented as a continuous matrix of genes
and conditions (e.g. cell types, tissues, pathways, experimental
conditions). Databases such as Gene Ontology (GO) (Botstein

at al., 2000) offer expert-deﬁned pathways and complementary
gene annotations that can be represented as binary values.

Investigators have already described strategies to assess enrich-
ment of GWA results for pathways or gene sets but not for
condition speciﬁcity (Holden et al., 2008; Weng et al., 2011).
In contrast to these methods, we do not require genotypes,
P—values, a priori gene sets or pathways or a priori deﬁnitions
of gene—SNP associations. We require only a list of SNP identi-
ﬁers, use LD structures to identify plausibly inﬂuential genes and
use a simple sampling approach to identify the conditions they
inﬂuence.

SNPsea is a general algorithm to identify the conditions rele-
vant to a trait by assessing the genes within associated loci for
enrichment of condition speciﬁcity.

2 METHODS

For a given set of SNPs, SNPsea tests genes implicated by LD, in aggre-
gate, for enrichment of speciﬁcity to a condition in a given matrix of
genes and conditions. The matrix must be normalized so that conditions
are comparable.

First, we identify genes implicated by each SNP using LD from refer-
ence genomes. Second, we calculate a speciﬁcity score for each condition
with these genes. Finally, we compare these scores with scores obtained
with null sets of matched SNP sets to calculate an empirical P—value for
each condition (see Supplementary Notes for algorithm details).

We empirically calculate P—values because we previously found that
analytical distributions can result in inaccurate P—values (Hu et al., 2011).
SNP linkage intervals, gene densities, gene sizes and gene functions are
correlated across the genome and are challenging to model analytically.

We used C + + for fast computation of P-values because Python was
prohibitively slow. The online reference manual details compilation and
installation procedures; we also provide executable ﬁles for immediate use
on select platforms.

2.1 Multiple genes implicated by LD

Accurate analyses must address the critical issue that SNPs from GWA
studies frequently implicate more than one gene (50% of GWAS Catalog
SNPs, Supplementary Fig. S2).

We deﬁned LD intervals with SNPs from the 1000 Genomes Project
(EUR) (Genomes Project Consortium, 2010) and a previously described
strategy (Supplementary Fig. S1) (Rossin et al., 2011). A SNP implicates
genes overlapping its LD interval, deﬁned by the furthest SNPs in a 1 Mb
window with r2>0.5. To ensure the associated genes are included, we
extend each interval to the nearest recombination hotspots with

recombination rate >3 cM/Mb (HapMap3) (Myers et al., 2005). We
merge SNPs with shared genes into a single locus.

By default, we assume that each associated locus harbours a single
inﬂuential gene rather than multiple genes. We provide an alternative
scoring method to account for multiple genes (Supplementary Notes)
that produces similar results in four traits we tested (Supplementary
Fig. S4).

Because interval lengths depend on the choice of r2 threshold, we
looked for an effect of this choice (Supplementary Fig. S3). The signiﬁ-
cant result for the Gene Atlas and blood cell count SNPs is robust to
different thresholds. Similarly, the choice of r2 threshold has little effect
on the signiﬁcant GO enrichment result for these SNPs.

2.2 Type I error estimates

We tested 10000 sets of 100 randomly selected LD-pruned SNPs. For
each condition (tissue or GO term), we observed appropriate proportions
of P—values <0.5, 0.1, 0.05, 0.01 and 0.005 (Supplementary Fig. S5).

3 EXAMPLES

We used SNPsea to identify tissues relevant to blood cell count
by testing 45 genome-wide signiﬁcant SNPs (van der Harst et al.,
2012) with expression data (Gene Atlas) for 17 581 genes across
79 human tissues (Su et al., 2004). Bone marrow CD71+ early
erythroid cells are signiﬁcantly enriched for cell type-speciﬁc
expression of the genes within the trait-associated loci
(P = 2 x 107) (Fig. 1).

The genes in these loci are enriched for the term hemopoiesis
(GO:0030097) (P = 2 x 10’5) (Supplementary Fig. S6), suggest-
ing that blood cell count may be inﬂuenced by the genes ex-
pressed speciﬁcally in early erythroid cells and involved in
forming blood cellular components.

We provide additional examples for SNPs associated with
multiple sclerosis, celiac disease and HDL cholesterol. Each in-
cludes Gene Atlas and GO enrichments, r2 comparisons and
comparisons of results assuming a single or multiple causal
genes (Supplementary Figs S7—9).

ABSTRACT

Summary: We have implemented a computational platform
(Moksiskaan) that integrates pathway, protein—protein interaction,
genome and literature mining data to result in comprehensive
networks for a list of genes or proteins. Moksiskaan is able
to generate hypothetical pathways for these genes or proteins
as well as estimate their activation statuses using regulation
information in pathway repositories. An automatically generated
result document provides a detailed description of the query genes,
biological processes and drug targets. Moksiskaan networks can be
downloaded to Cytoscape for further analysis. To demonstrate the
utility of Moksiskaan, we use gene microarray and clinical data from
>200 glioblastoma multiforme primary tumor samples and translate
the resulting set of 124 survival-associated genes to a network.

1 INTRODUCTION

High—throughput technologies, such as gene microarrays, are
effective in proﬁling gene expressions genome-wide and have
become standard means in biomedicine. Consequently, a multitude
of computational methods have been successfully applied to high-
throughput data resulting in the discovery of a large number of
disease-associated genes. An unresolved issue to date, however,
is how to interpret these results, such as gene lists, in biological
context. A popular solution is to apply statistical methods to identify
Gene Ontology categories or pathways that are associated with the
differentially expressed genes (DEGs), such as SPIA (Tarca et al.,
2008), SubpathwayMiner (Li et al., 2009) and KOBAS (Wu et al.,
2006). These methods typically use a pathway repository, such as
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2009), to assess whether a pathway is
signiﬁcantly inﬂuenced by the DEGs and produce a P-Value or a
score for each pathway.

Many pathways crosstalk, i.e. two or more pathways inﬂuence
each other. Thus, a gene may belong to a number of canonical
pathways or be inﬂuenced by many canonical pathways. Pathway
analysis methods that do not take crosstalking into account may
not be able to produce a comprehensive View on the impact of

the DEGs to pathways. In order to address the crosstalk issue, we
have implemented a computational platform called Moksiskaan that
integrates data from KEGG pathway and drug databases (Kanehisa
et al., 2009), cPath (Cerami et al., 2006)-based Pathway Commons
repository of pathways (http://www.pathwaycomm0ns.org/pcl),
Ensembl genome database (Hubbard et al., 2009), FINA protein—
protein interaction database (Wu et al., 2009) and SNPs3D literature
mining database (Yue et al., 2006) to translate gene or protein lists
to networks. Moksiskaan is able to (i) rapidly give an overview
of the biological functions of a list of genes, such as DEGs;
and (ii) form hypothetical pathways consisting of interconnections
between the genes. It can also be used to suggest drugs to target
proteins. Moksiskaan— generated networks can be Viewed as PDFs or
downloaded to Cytoscape (Cline et al., 2007) for further analysis.

2 APPROACH

Moksiskaan provides a ﬂexible and powerful schema to store and
query elements of an abstract and extensible data type structure
bioentity that currently represents genes, transcripts, proteins, drugs
and pathways as bioentity types. The connections between bioentity
types are strongly typed. For instance, a protein coding gene link is
used to connect proteins to their source genes only.

Moksiskaan can be used in four different modes. The ﬁrst
mode (‘connected’) constructs a comprehensive network for a list
of genes (or other bioentities) by using all imported pathways
to identify known regulations between the genes in the list.
Connections between these genes are Visualized along intermediate
genes controlled with a user-deﬁned parameter n, which describes
the maximum number of genes between two genes in the list. For
example, if n = 2 and the gene list contains Sos and MEK as DEGs in
the ErbB signaling pathway, also their intermediate genes Ras and
Raf are Visualized in the network. The coloring of Sos and MEK
in the resulting network corresponds to their observed expression
value, whereas Ras and Raf expression values are estimated from the
network using Boolean logic. In this example, if Sos is upregulated,
also Ras and Raf are predicted to be upregulated. Finally, topology
of the network is pruned using expression data on all DEGs so that
only edges that do not conﬂict with the observed states are retained.
Orphan genes with no neighbors are removed from the network.
The other three modes are: ‘up’ (only genes that are in upstream are
searched), ‘down’ (only genes that are in downstream are searched)
and ‘both’ (genes are searched using the modes ‘up’ and ‘down’).

3 METHODS

Moksiskaan runs on the Anduril workﬂow framework (freely available
at http://csbi.ltdk.helsinki.ﬁ/anduril/) and has been implemented using

associated genes. Edge colors and end point shapes distinguish between
the connection types as described in the upper left comer. Green and blue

the Hibernate framework, which simpliﬁes the data accession (Fevre
et al., 2007). Hibernate enables a separation between the database engine
(PostgreSQL) and the code, and provides a single point of maintenance for
the schema that is then propagated to:

0 SQL statements responsible for the database construction,

- Entity-relationship (ER) diagrams,

- HTML-based descriptions of the relations and their attributes, and
0 Java classes that are used to represent the data.

To demonstrate Moksiskaan, we used The Cancer Genome Atlas dataset
on glioblastoma multiforme, which is the most aggressive form of brain
cancers (McLendon et al., 2008). We downloaded the RMA normalized
gene expression (Affymetrix) data for 228 tumor samples belonging to
198 patients along with clinical data, as well as expression proﬁles for
10 normal tissue samples that were used as controls (McLendon et al.,
2008). We then used Kaplan—Meier method with log-rank test to identify
survival-associated genes. This resulted in 124 genes having a P-Value <0.01,
which were used as an input to Moksiskaan. We used ‘down’ mode (n :1)
to identify downstream genes that the survival-associated genes regulate.
Protein—protein interactions were disabled to reduce network complexity for
Visualization. The resulting network ﬁgure is presented in Supplementary
Material, and a zoom-in to the network in Figure 1.

4 DISCUSSION

In the network for 124 survival-associated genes, the genes EGFR
and ErbB2 are linked with a brown line with a triangle, which
denotes a protein complex (Fig. 1). Indeed, the genes EGFR
and ErbBZ encode receptors that can form a heterodimer, which
activates downstream signaling affecting various phenotypes, such
as cell growth and cell motility (Yarden and Shilo, 2007). The
Moksiskaan network further suggests that the EGFR and ErbBZ
complex activates the PI3K pathway directly (a node with eight
PIK3 genes) and Via J AKl. Activation of the PI3K pathway directly

by EGFR and ErbB2 is well—known (Liu et al., 2009; Yarden and
Shilo, 2007). However, JAKl has been mainly associated with
the immune system (Igaz et al., 2001) and is not considered as
a part of the canonical EGFR pathway (Yarden and Shilo, 2007).
Thus, the latter connection between EGFR/ErbB2 and PI3K pathway
could have remained unnoticed without a comprehensive network
approach. The drug data integration together with Gene Ontology
analysis, protein interactions and gene annotations are provided in
Supplementary Material.

In summary, we have designed and implemented a platform
that allows translation of gene lists to comprehensive networks
by integrating pathway, protein—protein interaction, literature
mining and genome data. This integrated set of regulatory
connections allows identiﬁcation of novel and experimentally
testable hypotheses. The networks generated by the Moksiskaan
platform can be downloaded to Cytoscape for editing and advanced
analysis.

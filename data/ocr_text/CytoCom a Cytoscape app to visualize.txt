Abstract

Summary: CytoCom is an interactive plugin for Cytoscape that can be used to search, explore, ana—
lyse and visualize human disease comorbidity network. It represents disease—disease associations
in terms of bipartite graphs and provides International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision
(ICD9)—centric and disease name centric views of disease information. It allows users to find associ—
ations between diseases based on the two measures: Relative Risk (RR) and qb—correlation values.
In the disease network, the size of each node is based on the prevalence of that disease. CytoCom
is capable of clustering disease network based on the ICD9 disease category. It provides user—
friendly access that facilitates exploration of human diseases, and finds additional associated dis—
eases by double—clicking a node in the existing network. Additional comorbid diseases are then
connected to the existing network. It is able to assist users for interpretation and exploration of the
human diseases by a variety of built—in functions. Moreover, CytoCom permits multi—colouring of
disease nodes according to standard disease classification for expedient visualization.

Availability and implementation: CytoCom is compatible with CytoScape 3.1.0 or later version.

1 Introduction

The term ‘comorbidity’ refers to the coexistence or presence of mul—
tiple diseases or disorders in relation to a primary disease or disorder
in a patient (Moni and Lid, 2014). A comorbidity relationship be—
tween two diseases eXists whenever they appear simultaneously in a
patient more than chance alone (Hidalgo et 61]., 2009). It represents
the co—occurrence of diseases or presence of different medical condi-
tions one after another in the same patient (Moni and Lid, 2014;
Hidalgo et 61]., 2009). Two diseases are connected if they are co—
eXpressed in a significant number of patients in a population
(Hidalgo et 61]., 2009). If two diseases have associated comorbidity,
the occurrence of one of them in a patient may increase the likeli-
hood of developing another disease.

The main challenge for research in the biomedical field is to
understand the associations between human diseases. Clinical data
contains many important clarifications regarding the occurrence of
comorbidity in patients with two or more diseases. To measure a re—
lationship based on disease co—occurrence, we need to quantify the
strength of the comorbidity risk. We have adapted two comorbidity
measures to quantify the strength of comorbidity associations be—
tween two diseases: (i) the Relative Risk — the probability that a
number of patients will be diagnosed with both diseases relative to
the probability that a number of patients will be similarly diagnosed
according to random expectation based on disease prevalence, as the
quantified measures of comorbidity tendency of two disease pairs;
and (ii) ¢-correlation — Pearsons correlation for binary variables, to
measure the robustness of the comorbidity association.

Fig. 1. Cytoscape screenshot of CytoCom. The centre of the screen shows an example of DCN, which is constructed based on clinical data. Each node represents
a unique disease; the nodes are coloured according to their disease categories so that diseases of the same category have the same colour. Two nodes are con-
sidered to be linked if the diseases are significantly comorbid more than the randomly expected according to their specified RR and d) values

Cytoscape is a widely used Java—based, open—source platform for
network visualization and analysis (Shannon et al., 2003). The
Cytoscape framework is extendable through the implementation of
apps. We have developed a Cytoscape app, named CytoCom, that
enables a user to visualize the disease—disease network. To the best
of our knowledge, CytoCom is the first app to provide a user with
the facility to query, analyse and visualize disease—disease dynamic
network using clinical information. CytoCom can be started
from the control panel in Cytoscape. The main panel is shown in
Figure 1.

2 Overview

2.1 Network data sources

Patient medical records offer reliable data on diseases. To achieve a
comprehensive study, we identify the comorbidity correlations of
diseases based on the clinical information from the US Medicare
claims database, http://www.icd9data.com, and collected from
Hidalgo et al. (2009). Demographically, our dataset consists of the
medical records of 13,039,018 patients in the ICD—9—CM format.
International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes are
3—5 digits long and have hierarchical structures, with each 4—digit
code being a subset of a 5—digit code, both of which also contain a
further 3—digit code subset. In total, the ICD—9—CM includes 657 dif—
ferent categories at the 3—digit level. Each digit span for all diseases
is then further classified based on gender and race.

2.2 Network construction

To understand the correlations between diseases, the disease—disease
pair comorbidity correlations are visualized as a bipartite network
graph. Two diseases are connected through an edge if they are asso—
ciated. CytoCom constructs disease comorbidity network (DCN) in
which nodes are diseases and edges indicate the comorbidity associ—
ations among them. CytoCom includes edges between disease pairs

for which the co—occurrence is significantly greater than the random
expectation based on the population prevalence of the diseases. For
a pair of diseases 1' and 1', we used two novel statistical measures to
quantify the relationship between two diseases: Relative Risk (RRij)
and ¢—correlation (dyi) based on the Hidalgo et al. (2009). The two
comorbidity measures are not completely independent each other.
The RRij allows us to quantify the co—occurrence of disease pairs
compared with the random expectation and dyl- allows us to measure
the robustness of the comorbidity associations. Users can use integer
or decimal numbers as input for both RR,,- and dyi. When two dis—
eases co—occur more frequently than expected by chance, we will get
RRij > 1 and dyl- > 0. The significance of the RR,,- is calculated using
the Katz et al. method to estimate confidence intervals (Katz et al.
1978). To explore a particular disease, user needs to enter the seed
disease code in the search box; CytoCom makes use of Cytoscape to
construct the network and create a network view of disease associ—
ation. The user can filter network using different input parameters
based on gender, race and ICD—9 codes.

2.3 Network visualization

In the ICD—9 classification, diseases are assigned to different disease
categories based on the first three digits of a given ICD—9 code. This
classification is represented by a specific colouring of the nodes. The
size of the nodes is visualized according to the prevalence of the dis—
eases. More common diseases are represented as larger nodes.
Additional associated diseases could be found by double clicking of
a disease node of the existing network, which enables to access
more association or comorbidity information of that disease.
The additional diseases network is added to the existing network dy—
namically. Herein, the multi—colouring of disease nodes offers a con—
venient visualization of disease classifications in the networks. In
addition, it offers a user—friendly means of conducting a visual ex—
ploration. CytoCom automatically creates a database table of map—
ping ICD—9 codes to disease names. It is also possible to export the

details in user manual).

3 Conclusion

Exploring the associations between diseases could greatly enhance
our understanding of pathogenesis and eventually lead to better
diagnosis and treatment. CytoCom is an easy—to—use app to analyse
and investigate the human DCN. This app will help users to advance
their knowledge on disease mechanism and disease comorbidities in
a quantitative and graphical way. We plan regular updates to the
CytoCom app as well as the integration of further data sources.

Abstract

Summary: The lack of visualization frameworks to guide interpretation and facilitate discovery is a
potential bottleneck for precision medicine, systems genetics and other studies. To address this we
have developed an interactive, reproducible, web-based prioritization approach that builds on our
earlier work. HitWalker2 is highly flexible and can utilize many data types and prioritization methods
based upon available data and desired questions, allowing it to be utilized in a diverse range of stud-
ies such as cancer, infectious disease and psychiatric disorders.

Availability and implementation: Source code is freely available at https://github.com/biodev/
HitWalker2 and implemented using Python/Django, Neo4j and Javascript (D3.js and jOuery). We
support major open source browsers (e.g. Firefox and Chromium/Chrome).

1 Introduction

Across domains, the need to integrate and prioritize genes or variants is
a common theme—for therapeutic selection, as well as for mechanistic
and perturbation studies. Network-context methods can facilitate
the ranking of genes and associated genetic variants/mutations. For in-
stance, some serve to rank the variant genes of individual subjects rela-
tive to orthogonal biological assay data (Bottome et al., 2013; Jia and
Zhao, 2014) whereas others can be used for GWAS or QTL studies
(Kohler et al., 2008). As a whole, these approaches can integrate differ-
ent data types and statically report results, but up to now have
not focused on making the data ‘accessible’ with respect to discovery,
interpretation and knowledge acquisition. To this end we developed
HitWalker2, which is a highly customizable approach to both produc-
ing a ranked list of genes utilizing network and external information
and exploring these results using graph-centric interactive visualiza-
tions. Details of the HitWalker2 workﬂow and framework itself can be
found in the Supplementary Material.

2 Description of software

2.1 Overview

The original HitWalker R package provided a means to priori-
tize variants stored in an SQL database and display the results
using a static image of a relevant subnetwork and a text sum-
mary that could be exported to an Excel document. Interaction
with the program was via R syntax and as such it required a
working R environment or access to a server that does and
some familiarity with the language (or additional training
time).

HitWalker2 contains all of the features of the original but add-
itionally was designed as an approach to allow users to access mean-
ingful aspects of their data through interactions with genes, subjects
and groups as a series of graphs organized as panels. The vast major-
ity of these interactions involve mouse clicks and dragging oper-
ations, a paradigm which bench scientists and clinicians will be
familiar with.

HitWalker2 extends the static subnetwork image of HitWalker
to allow user interactivity along multiple levels. This interactivity
is not just due to relatively basic features such as reorganizing
nodes and retrieving information about nodes. More importantly, it
provides the ability to ask biologically meaningful questions with or
without use of a prioritization approach.

2.2 Functionality

In the original Hitwalker framework, the key focus was on prioritiz-
ing genes in individual samples. We have extended this in
HitWalker2 to now include: (i) summarization and subsetting of co-
hort-level phenotypic attributes, (ii) cohort-level identification of re-
current genes based on ‘hits’ (as defined by thresholding multiple
biological assay results), (iii) identification of subset of cohort
with the same hit results in a given set of genes, (iv) pathway-context
for results (individual, subset and full cohort), (v) ability to group
subjects and genes by specified relationships/queries, (vi) ability to
export results via CSV/PDF and (vii) fully interactive web-based
visualization platform.

3 Applications

3.1 Overview

We created a base database for human samples consisting of high
confidence STRING interactions (Jensen et al., 2009), pathways
from Pathway Commons (Cerami et al., 2011) and gene symbol
mapping information from NCBI (Maglott et al., 2005). This data-
base is available at our Github wiki along with steps used in its
creation.

3.1.1 Precision medicine use case

One of the major translational challenges is target classification and
prioritization in the clinical setting (Andre et al., 2014). In this use
case, the goal is to rank the cancer variants relative to expression
and drug sensitivity that could guide therapeutic selection (Fig. 1).
To illustrate this use case, we utilize cancer expression, variant and
drug data from the Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (Barretina et al.,
2012). An expanded demo and walk-through of this example is pro-
vided on the Github wiki. We note that Hitwalker2 provides context
to allow the user to move beyond individualized prioritization. For
the HepG2 example, we have identified a prioritized gene set
derived from the corresponding inhibitor assay results. We can then
determine whether other samples or members of the cohort have
mutations in the same genes (Supplementary Fig. S1). The inter-
active panels allow both individual and cohort level summaries. For
example, at the cohort level, one can rapidly determine the most re-
currently mutated genes in the cohort or for a selected subset of the
cohort. Any overexpressed genes or drug sensitivity hits will auto-
matically be displayed as part of the result. Pathways containing
interesting genes can then be visualized (Supplementary Fig. 52).
Exporting these results can be done via images of the graph panel(s)
as well as text files.

3.1.2 GWAS evidence-based visualization use case

ADHD GWAS results (Psychiatric Genetic Consortium; http://www.
med.unc.edu/pgcl) were combined with study genotypes (unpublished
data, JN and BW) and DNA methylation P-values (Wilmot et al.,
2015). In addition to top SNPs identified from a single GWAS study,
it is useful to combine GWAS from multiple data sets and additional
data types to strengthen the support for biologically important SNPs.
For this use case, the focus is on rapidly identifying candidate genes

The set of cell lines with NRAS mutations in the exome data was first
retrieved and subsetted to only those cell lines derived from skin. Drug treat-
ment data were used to identify MAPK7 as the most frequently perturbed
gene target (GeneScore). The user can then explore the mutational burden of
the pathways containing MAPK7, in this example, the Toll-Like Receptor 3
Cascade pathway from Reactome

with support across multiple studies and data types (Supplementary
Fig. S3). P-values from a case/control meta-analysis of four Attention
Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder datasets were used to compare with
SNPs from a candidate gene study. This use case could also allow
identification of inconsistencies across studies and provide network-
context to GWAS results from both a patient and cohort perspective.

4 Discussion

HitWalker2 provides a visual, reproducible and flexible framework
for prioritization that is applicable to a large number of clinical,
translational and basic science use cases. The interactive framework
facilitates discovery and guide interpretation in a robust and scalable
way. This is timely given the growing recognition for more emphasis
on human—data interactions.

The HitWalker2 framework is datatype agnostic and can include
any type of experiment/assay which at the end suggests an effect on
a gene such as variant/mutation data, copy number variation, ex-
pression as well as siRNA or drug screens.

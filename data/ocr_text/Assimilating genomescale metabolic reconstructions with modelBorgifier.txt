ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-scale reconstructions and models, as collec-
tions of genomic and metabolic information, provide a useful means
to compare organisms. Comparison requires that models are similarly
notated to pair shared components.

Result: Matching and comparison of genome-scale reconstructions
and models are facilitated by modelBorgifier. It reconciles models in
light of different annotation schemes, allowing diverse models to
become useful for synchronous investigation.

Availability and implementation: The modelBorgifier toolbox is

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic reconstructions can help develop hypothesis-driven dis-
covery, provide a background for high-throughput data and pro-
vide an in silico sandbox for metabolic engineering (Oberhardt
et al., 2009). Because reconstructions are easily interpretable and
functionally testable representations of an organism’s genome
and metabolism, they also provide a means to compare organ-
isms (Oberhardt et al., 2011). Comparing reconstructions allows
for conserved metabolic pathways, growth predictions under
similar conditions and multi-organism communities to be inves-
tigated. Importantly, these studies are predicated on the stipula-
tion that the concerned models are semantically compatible,
consistently annotated and similarly notated. Ideally, reaction
and metabolite entries would use identical naming methods.

The increased popularity of genome-scale reconstructions and
models (GEMs) has sparked the development of markup and
semantic standards. Namely, Systems Biology Markup
Language (SBML) has been adopted as the lingua franca for
model exchange (Hucka et al., 2003). However, this standard
does not deﬁne a naming scheme for reactions and metabolites
or a generally accepted reference database. Consequently, fully
automated comparison of GEMs from diverse sources is cur-
rently impossible.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To rectify this situation, some attempts have been made to
create collections of GEMs that use a standard reaction and
metabolite nomenclature. This includes the BIGG database
(Schellenberger et al., 2010) and MetRxn (Kumar et al., 2012).
Although both provide online databases of curated models, users
cannot submit models. This precludes the spontaneous compari-
son of additional or novel GEMs, such as those from the model
SEED (Henry et al., 2010).

Tools do exist to compare and to merge arbitrary SBML for-
matted regulatory (Randhawa et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2010) or
biochemical (Krause et al., 2010; Schulz et al., 2012) models.
However, these methods are predominantly aimed at combining
(sub-) models into larger entities.

Here we present, modelBorgiﬁer, a tool that is specifically
aimed at comparing and combining large, curated or automatic-
ally generated, organism—speciﬁc genome-scale reconstructions. It
is implemented in MATLAB and integrates seamlessly with the
popular openCOBRA Toolbox (Schellenberger et al., 2011).

Model comparison uses both greedy and network comparison
techniques to find matching reaction and metabolite entries.
Merging is done in a semiautomated fashion; manual match/
no match decisions are fed to machine learning algorithms to
augment auto-matching. The resulting composite model provides
a framework to compare models, a means to share information
between them and a reaction database for in silico meta-
bolic engineering. The original models can be extracted from
the composition with mathematical fidelity and addended
information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Model comparison and matching

Model comparison is performed via pairwise comparison of reactions
based on 40 parameters. Reactions are scored via both greedy (string
similarity) comparison of their annotations and the annotations of their
reactants, and their local network topology. The weighted sum of the 40
parameters constitutes the similarity score for each pair of reactions or
metabolites.

After reactions are scored, the user is guided with a graphical user
interface (GUI, Fig. l) to declare reactions as possessing a match or as
new. Once a reaction is designated, the involved metabolites are com-
pared and matched or declared new with an analogous GUI. Metabolites
can be compared independently of reactions.

The process of matching a reaction (or metabolite) from the compari-
son model can be seen as a set of binary decisions between match or no
match for each reaction (or metabolite) in the template model. If the

result is ‘no match’ for all reactions (or metabolites) in the template
model, the reaction is declared new. Based on the similarity score, reac-
tions and metabolites can be designated automatically by setting cutoff
scores for match and no match. Because declared metabolites can eluci-
date the proper designation for yet unconsidered reactions, auto-match-
ing proceeds iteratively when initiated.

Sets of previously declared matches and no matches are used to opti-
mize the weighting of the scoring parameters to improve the accuracy of
auto-matching. To this end, support vector machine (SVM) learning,
a linear and an exponential weighting model are available in
modelBorgiﬁer. Via machine learning, the scoring vector is tailored to
emphasize only the annotation information in the models that is pertinent
to comparison.

2.2 Model merging

When merging two models, modelBorgiﬁer ensures that models can later
be retrieved from the composition in a mathematically identical form and
indeed carry the same ﬂux. Reaction and metabolite matches (including
those that differ only in their compartment location) share annota-
tion information. Original model IDs are retained, but for the purposes
of the composite model there is a unique ID list for reactions and
metabolites.

Comparison statistics are automatically generated between source
models that constitute the composition. This includes completeness of
annotations, FBA results and similarity between models in terms of
shared reactions and metabolites (both literal and compartment agnos-
tic). Because the composition can contain many models, all cross simila-
rities are calculated.

2.3 Model import and export

All models that can be imported natively into the MATLAB environment
via the openCOBRA Toolbox can be read, compared and combined by
modelBorgiﬁer. Augmented reconstructions extracted from a composite
model can be written to SBML. The merged model itself can be saved as a
MATLABmat ﬁle for future comparisons or modiﬁcations. It can also
be ﬂattened and treated as a standalone model, but the ability to extract
the source models is then lost.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The modelBorgiﬁer toolbox was created in the MATLAB pro-
gramming environment. It uses the flux balance analysis

functionality from the openCOBRA Toolbox for model valid-
ation and gap ﬁlling, and the contained MATLAB
SBMLToolbox for model import and export. To improve
weighting of scoring parameters, SVM, linear or exponential op-
timization are used alternatively. SVM machine learning relies on
the LIBSVM library (Chang and Lin, 2013), and linear and ex-
ponential optimization depends on the MATLAB optimization
toolbox. The modelBorgiﬁer toolbox requires no installation
beyond adding the folder to the MATLAB path. A manual
with instructions and examples is available.

The time required to compare models is reduced by
modelBorgiﬁer as compared with purely manual method. For
instance, on a standard desktop PC, it takes ~4h to compare
iBSU1103 and i] 01366. The time required for model comparison
scales linearly with the number of pairwise comparisons
(Supplementary Fig. S1). User oversight of the merging can gen-
erally be performed in a few hours but depends on the quality of
the auto-matching.

4 CONCLUSION

The modelBorgiﬁer toolbox is a script suite that facilitates com-
paring and combining openCOBRA Toolbox compatible
genome-scale metabolic reconstructions. It assists in the arduous
task of reconciling dissimilarly annotated models in an efﬁcient
and practical manner, combining user oversight, and smart auto-
mation. modelBorgiﬁer works simply within COBRA, which
already enjoys general ease of use, a wide function selection
and an active community (http://opencobra.sourceforge.net/).

By combining models, the user can easily compare as well as
share information among models. Comparing two reconstruc-
tions for the same organism can be useful for building a
more complete model or one more tailored to speciﬁc investiga-
tions. Comparing reconstructions from different sources for the
same organism can elucidate gaps or mistakes in either of
the reconstructions. Additional datasets, such as thermodynamic
data, can be mapped across multiple reconstructions. The
composite model can also serve as a source database of reac-
tions for in silico metabolic engineering tools (Zomorrodi et al.,
2012).

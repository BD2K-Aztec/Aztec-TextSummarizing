ABSTRACT

Summary: Analyzing large-scale interaction networks has generated
numerous insights in systems biology. However, such studies have
primarily been focused on highly co-expressed, stable interactions.
Most transient interactions that carry out equally important functions,
especially in signal transduction pathways, are yet to be elucidated
and are often wrongly discarded as false positives. Here, we revisit
a previously described Smith—Waterman-like dynamic programming
algorithm and use it to distinguish stable and transient interactions
on a genomic scale in human and yeast. We find that in
biological networks, transient interactions are key links topologically
connecting tightly regulated functional modules formed by stable
interactions and are essential to maintaining the integrity of cellular
networks. We also perform a systematic analysis of interaction
dynamics across different technologies and find that high-throughput
yeast two-hybrid is the only available technology for detecting
transient interactions on a large scale.

1 INTRODUCTION

The protein—protein interactome of an organism is the network
of all biophysically possible interactions of different proteins
in that organism (Yu et al., 2008). It is of key importance to
accurately map this network as most proteins function by interacting
with other proteins (Pawson and Nash, 2000). Moreover, a better
understanding of genotype to phenotype relationships in human
disease requires modeling of how disease—causing mutations might
affect protein interactions and interactome properties (Goh et al.,
2007; Wang et al., 2011). Currently, there are two main high—
throughput technologies to generate high—quality protein—protein
interactomes on a large scale: yeast two—hybrid (Y2H), where a
protein interaction reconstitutes a transcription factor which then
activates expression of reporter genes (Fields and Song, 1989), and
afﬁnity puriﬁcation followed by mass spectrometry (AP/MS), where
proteins bound to tagged baits are co—puriﬁed and identiﬁed (Rigaut
et al., 1999). High—throughput Y2H maps have been generated for
yeast, ﬂy, worm and human, while large—scale AP/MS datasets have

been generated for yeast, worm and human (Jensen and Bork, 2008;
Yu et al., 2008). An alternative approach, adopted by most databases,
is to obtain literature—curated (LC) interactions (Cusick et al., 2009).

It has been shown that well—controlled Y2H and AP/MS
experiments are both of high quality but of complementary nature—
Y2H identiﬁes direct binary interactions whereas AP/MS determines
co—complex associations (Jensen and Bork, 2008; Yu et al., 2008).
Moreover, gene expression and other functional genomics datasets
are routinely integrated with protein—protein interactions to validate
their biological relevance—for example, interactions between
proteins encoded by co—expressed genes are often considered to be of
high quality (Ge et al., 2001; Suthram et al., 2006; von Mering et al.,
2002). In these analyses, gene co—expression is normally determined
by a high Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC), which really means
that the expression levels of the two genes are correlated over
most conditions, i.e. they are globally co—expressed (Fig. 1A).
Previous studies have shown that interacting proteins within stable
complexes also tend to be encoded by globally co—expressed gene
pairs (Jansen et al., 2002; Yu et al., 2008). On the other hand,
the regulation and coordination of the subcellular machinery is
achieved by dynamic transient interactions for example in signal
transduction pathways (Jansen et al., 2002). Proteins involved in
transient interactions are not globally co—expressed. Rather, they
share local blocks of co—expression. Transient interactions and their
dynamics have signiﬁcant biological importance, but most genes in
these pathways are often co—expressed only under certain conditions
(Fig. 1B). As a result, these are usually discarded as false positives
(Ge et al., 2001; Suthram et al., 2006). Here, we take advantage of a
novel measurement of expression relationships (Qian et al., 2001) to
directly distinguish stable from transient interactions on a genome—
wide scale in human and yeast and systematically analyze their
topological and biological signiﬁcance. We also evaluate different
technologies in terms of their sensitivity in detecting interaction
dynamics on a genomic scale.

2 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

2.1 Expression dynamics: global versus
local co-expression

For our analysis, we created compendiums of gene expression
and high—quality large—scale protein—protein interaction datasets
for human and yeast (Supplementary Note SNl). We decided
to use time course datasets because four distinct kinds of
expression relationships—co—expression, time—shifted, inverted and
inverted time—shifted—can be determined using such datasets

(Qian et al., 2001). Details of the biological signiﬁcance of each
of these four categories can be found in Supplementary Note SN2.
As the cell is in a different state at each of these time points, we are
in fact measuring expression under different intracellular conditions.
All datasets are carefully normalized to remove potential noise
(Irizarry et al., 2003; Johnson et al., 2007; Luscombe et al., 2003; Yu
et al., 2007b). We also compiled high—quality large—scale protein—
protein interaction datasets for human and yeast spanning both
high—throughput technologies—Y2H and AP/MS. We consolidated
high—quality binary interactions in the literature from various
databases (Supplementary Note SN3). Although traditionally these
LC interactions are considered to be of high quality, recent studies
have shown that many of them, especially those supported by
only one publication, in fact tend to be false positives (Cusick
et al., 2009). To remove unreliable interactions from our analysis,
we carefully compiled comprehensive sets of high—quality binary
LC interactions supported by multiple publications (named ‘LC—
multiple’) for human and yeast. High—quality LC co—complex
associations were obtained from MIPS (Mewes et al., 2011)
for yeast and Reactome (D’Eustachio, 2011) for human—two
databases generally considered as gold standards for complexes
in the corresponding organisms (Jansen et al., 2002; Lage et al.,
2007).

From these datasets, we ﬁrst calculated the PCC for expression
proﬁles corresponding to interacting protein pairs in the high—quality
interaction datasets described above. For a pair of gene expression
proﬁles, PCC reports the global correlation of expression levels
across all conditions (Qian et al., 2001). A PCC value close to
one indicates the pair of genes is globally co—expressed (Fig. 1A),
whereas values close to zero indicate random, uncorrelated

expression patterns. We ﬁnd that the different interaction datasets
for both human and yeast are signiﬁcantly enriched for global
co—expression as opposed to random gene pairs (Figs. 2A &
B). Since PCC is a linear correlation coefﬁcient and certain co—
expression relationships could be non—linear, we also used the
maximal information coefﬁcient (MIC) (Reshef et al., 2011) to
explore global expression dynamics of the different interaction
datasets in human and yeast. MIC belongs to a class of maximal
information—based nonparametric exploration (MINE) statistics and
has been shown to be very robust in detecting a wide range of
associations both linear and not (Reshef et al., 2011). Using MIC,
we revalidate the global expression dynamics captured by PCC—all
the high—quality interaction datasets in both human and yeast have
signiﬁcantly enriched global co—expression as opposed to random
gene pairs (Supplementary Figure SF1). Interacting protein pairs
that have PCC greater than a certain cutoff (Supplementary Note
SN4) are deﬁned as stable interactions.

However, gene pairs that are only co—expressed under certain
conditions could have low and non—signiﬁcant global PCC/MIC
values. These often go undetected in the global nature of the
computation, making global correlation an ineffective method
for identifying condition—speciﬁc characteristics of transient
interactions. To deﬁne dynamic co—expression relationships, we
employed a Smith—Waterman—like dynamic programming algorithm
as described previously (Qian et al., 2001). For each pair of
genes and their expression proﬁles, this algorithm calculates local
expression—correlation scores (LES) to ﬁnd subsets of conditions
with correlated expression levels (Fig. 1B). Interacting proteins that
do not pass the global PCC cutoff but have high LES are deﬁned as
transient interactions (see Section 4).

2.2 Interaction dynamics: stable versus transient

Next, to explore interaction dynamics across different technologies,
we compared how successful different experimental techniques were
in detecting stable and transient interactions. In agreement with
previous studies, stable interactions within subcellular complexes
show a strong enrichment of proteins encoded by globally co—
expressed genes (Figs. 2A & B, Supplementary Figure SF1). On
the other hand, although statistically signiﬁcant, the enrichment of
these globally co—expressed pairs is much less for binary interactions
from both large—scale Y2H and LC sources. This lack of global
co—expression has often been used as an argument to suggest that
high—throughput Y2H interactions are of low quality (Ge et al., 2001;
Suthram et al., 2006; von Mering et al., 2002). However, a recent
study applied orthogonal assays to experimentally conﬁrm that these
binary interactions are in fact highly reliable (Yu et al., 2008).
Figures 2C and D shows that in both human and yeast, Y2H is the
only technology consistently able to identify transient interactions
signiﬁcantly more than random expectation. Surprisingly, binary
interactions from the literature are not enriched with transient
ones. Given the sociological biases within interactions from the
literature (Cusick et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2008), there might be many
compounding factors for this result. Stable interactions are easier
to recapitulate under different experimental conditions, whereas
transient interactions can only be tested under speciﬁc conditions.
Therefore, transient interactions are more likely to be considered
as false positives and not reported in the literature. In addition,
in the post—genomic era, many candidate interaction partners are

ﬁrst identiﬁed based on gene expression and other genomic features
favoring selection of stable interactions over transient ones. This
result further highlights the importance of high—throughput Y2H
because it is the only technology available to detect transient
interactions, conﬁrming that different protein interaction detection
technologies capture different modes of biochemical interactions
(Jensen and Bork, 2008; Yu et al., 2008).

2.3 Biological signiﬁcance of transient interactions

To assess the biological signiﬁcance of transient interactions as
deﬁned by our algorithm, we computed functional similarity
of protein pairs involved in these interactions. We ﬁnd that
transient interactions are signiﬁcantly enriched for proteins with
similar functions and the fold enrichment is comparable to that
of stable interactions in both human and yeast (Supplementary
Figure SF2.). These results conﬁrm the validity of our deﬁnition
of transient interactions. We therefore provide the ﬁrst method
to systematically detect transient interactions on a genomic scale.
Although our method might miss certain transient interactions,
especially extremely transient ones that are virtually impossible to
distinguish from random, our results conﬁrm that those detected
by our method are high quality and share signiﬁcant functional
similarity.

A good example of transient interactions identiﬁed by Y2H is
the interaction between Sfb2 and Sec23. This interaction has been
conﬁrmed in vivo (Peng et al., 2000). Sec23 is a subunit of the
COPII complex required for the budding of transport vesicles from
endoplasmic reticulum (Miller et al., 2003). SFBZ has a 56%
sequence identity with SEC24, an essential component of COPII
involved in cargo selection (Miller et al. 2003). Overexpression
of SFBZ can rescue the secZ4 null mutant cells (Kurihara et al.,
2000). Furthermore, it has been suggested experimentally that Sfb2
may recognize different export signals from those of Sec24 and
may be used under non—normal growth conditions (Miller et al.,
2003; Peng et al., 2000). These results agree with the expression
dynamics revealed by our new analysis—SFBZ and SE C23 are only
co—expressed during stress response (Fig. 3A).

2.4 Transient interactions key in maintaining
network integrity

Traditionally, in network analysis, the focus has been on nodes.
Hubs are crucial in maintaining the integrity of biological networks
(Albert et al., 2000; Barabasi and Albert, 1999; Jeong et al., 2000).
Interaction networks have two broad categories of hubs. Date hubs
have low average PCC with their interactors and hold the key in
maintaining the integrity of cellular networks, while party hubs have

Genome-scale analysis of interaction dynamics

 

high average PCC with their interactors and are often contained in
tightly organized modules (Han et al., 2004). We ﬁnd that date hubs
have a signiﬁcant propensity to be involved in transient interactions
(Figs. 3B & 3C), suggesting that these play an important role in
maintaining the integrity of the networks. To validate this result, we
compared the edge ‘betweenness’ of global and transient interactions
(Supplementary Note SN5). Edge betweenness can be used to detect
community structure within networks (Girvan and Newman, 2002).
Clusters detected by this approach tend to share similar functions
(Dunn et al., 2005). We ﬁnd that transient interactions for both
human and yeast have a signiﬁcantly higher betweenness than
stable interactions (Fig. 3D). This implies that transient interactions
hold the key in maintaining the integrity of the underlying cellular
network. Disrupting these will partition the interactome into disjoint
clusters, unable to perform temporally and spatially well—regulated
processes.

To further explore topological properties of transient interactions,
we examined connectivity in response to progressive edge removal
and found that selectively removing transient interactions increased
characteristic path length much more sharply than selectively
removing stable or random interactions (Figs. 3E & 3F). Biological
interactomes are small—world networks and removing a random edge
is unlikely to signiﬁcantly alter connectivity, as most random edges
are not essential in maintaining network integrity (Albert et al.,
2000). However, selectively disrupting key edges disrupts network
structure and increases the characteristic path length signiﬁcantly.
Since removal of transient interactions causes the sharpest increase
in path length, these are indeed critical for network integrity.

3 CONCLUSIONS

Here, we utilize a previously described Smith—Waterman—like
dynamic programming algorithm to segregate transient interactions
from stable complexes on a genomic scale directly from gene
expression data. For the ﬁrst time, we distinguish their biological
roles and show that although transient interactions are currently
underexplored, they perform key biological functions and are
essential to maintaining the integrity of cellular networks. Moreover,
we ﬁnd that Y2H is currently the only technology that is
able to determine transient interactions on a large scale. Our
ﬁndings are likely to generate signiﬁcant interest in designing
experiments to detect transient interactions to further explore their
properties.

4 METHODS
4.1 Calculating PCC, MIC and LES

PCC was calculated in a massively parallel Java program (Supplementary
Note SN6) using the Parallel Java framework (Kaminsky, 2010). MIC
was calculated using a Java implementation provided by Reshef et al
(2011). Transient interactions for human and yeast were identiﬁed with a
similar Parallel Java implementation of a Smith—Waterman—like dynamic
programming algorithm (Supplementary Note SN7) to calculate LES (Qian
et al., 2001). A summarization of the total count and technology—speciﬁc
count of stable and transient interactions is listed in Supplementary Tables
STl and ST2.

4.2 Calculating betweenness and functional similarity

Edge betweenness was calculated using the Girvan—Newman algorithm
(Girvan and Newman, 2002). Functional similarity was studied using total
ancestry measure—a metric that takes the entire biological process tree
and calculates the association of each gene with a biological process.
For each protein pair query, it computes what fraction of all possible
protein pairs that share the same set of Gene Ontology (Ashbumer et al.,
2000) biological pathway terms as the query pair (Yu et al., 2007a).
The calculations are performed using a massively Parallel Java program
(Kaminsky, 2010).

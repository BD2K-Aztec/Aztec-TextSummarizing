ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding the encoding and propagation of
information by biochemical reaction networks and the relationship of
such information processing properties to modular network structure
is of fundamental importance in the study of cell signalling and
regulation. However, a rigorous, automated approach for general
biochemical networks has not been available, and high-throughput
analysis has therefore been out of reach.

Results: Modularization Identification by Dynamic Independence
Algorithms (MIDIA) is a user-friendly, extensible R package that
performs automated analysis of how information is processed by
biochemical networks. An important component is the algorithm’s
ability to identify exact network decompositions based on both the
mass action kinetics and informational properties of the network.
These modularizations are visualized using a tree structure from
which important dynamic conditional independence properties can
be directly read. Only partial stoichiometric information needs to be
used as input to MIDIA, and neither simulations nor knowledge of
rate parameters are required. When applied to a signalling network,
for example, the method identifies the routes and species involved in
the sequential propagation of information between its multiple inputs
and outputs. These routes correspond to the relevant paths in the tree
structure and may be further visualized using the Input—Output Path
Matrix tool. MIDIA remains computationally feasible for the largest
network reconstructions currently available and is straightfonlvard
to use with models written in Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML).

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding how information is encoded and transferred by
biochemical networks is of central importance in cellular and
systems biology (Barkai and Shilo, 2007; Nurse, 2008). We recently
introduced a rigorous new approach grounded in biochemical, mass

action kinetics and based on dynamic conditional independences
between species trajectories (Bowsher, 2010, 2011). A species
trajectory is the time course of the number of molecules of a
particular type of biomolecule. By deriving dynamic conditional
independences, we are able to identify the species trajectories
that fully encode the relevant information and thus to trace the
sequential process of information transfer through the network
(Section 5.2.1 in Supplementary Material). Importantly, the
approach is applicable to a wide class of stochastic dynamics
(Bowsher, 2011).

A suitable foundation has thus been laid for automated and
potentially high-throughput computational analysis of information
processing, kinetic independence and modular architecture for
a wide class of biochemical networks. Here, the necessary
algorithms and software for such analyses are made available
to the community in a user-friendly, extensible package called
MIDIA (Modularization Identiﬁcation by Dynamic Independence
Algorithms). The package is written in the freely available
R language and is therefore applicable to the majority of
operating systems (including Windows, Mac and Linux). MIDIA
is straightforward to use with models of intracellular dynamics
written in Systems Biology Markup Language or SBML (Hucka
et al., 2003) and hence also with public repositories of systems
biology models such as the BioModels Database (Le Novere et al.,
2006).

An important component of MIDIA is the ability to compute
exact network decompositions based on dynamic independence
properties of the modules (Section 5.2.3 in Supplementary Material).
MIDIA identiﬁes the species resulting in the overlap of modules
and thus the important intermediaries in the network. Of all
those species present in other modules, only those in a given
module’s overlap region or intersection are relevant for the
instantaneous kinetics of its other species and (if stipulated) for
the trajectory of the module. Noteworthy departures from previous
approaches to module identiﬁcation are that the decompositions are
explicitly based on dynamic, informational properties, and that these
decompositions are not partitions. Graphical, community detection-
based methods (Guimera and Amaral, 2005; Kashtan and Alon,
2005) were extended by Saez-Rodriguez et al. (2008) to kinetic (but
solely deterministic) models of signalling networks by partitioning
the species between modules so as to minimize inter—modular
‘retroactiVity’. Constraint-based module detection methods such as
correlated reaction sets (or ‘Co-sets’, Papin et al., 2004) assume
steady-state dynamics in which concentrations are constant over
time. We believe that this limits the scope of their applicability,

particularly in the context of the dynamics of gene regulatory and
signalling networks.

2 RESULTS

Use of the majority of the functionality of MIDIA requires no
knowledge of the R language beyond that needed to call the
MIDIA( .) function. The function’s input variables are shown
immediately below.

PLOT,InfoProc,Granularity,MaxIter,PlotJTree)

2.1 Inputs

To analyse a biochemical reaction network, MIDIA requires
speciﬁcation of that network in terms of its reactant, product and
quasi -st0ichi0metric matrices. The ﬁrst two matrices simply identify
the reactants and products of each reaction. The third identiﬁes
two groups of species for each reaction: those overall consumed
by the reaction and those overall produced by it. Input of a full
(as opposed to quasi-) stoichiometrix matrix is not necessary but,
when available, reﬁnes the resultant analysis. The MIDIA function
mRmSmP f romSBML ( " SBMLmodel . xml " ) returns the required
input matrices for a network written in SBML using the rsbml
package (an R binding for libsbml available within Bioconductor’s
biocLite).

The full functionality of MIDIA, speciﬁcally the analysis of
information processing properties, requires that a reaction network
is speciﬁed (in the manner just described). Nevertheless, for all other
types of biomolecular network that may be represented as a graph,
MIDIA provides a generic approach for exact, computationally
efﬁcient decomposition into possibly overlapping modules. Protein
interaction and gene regulatory networks, for example, can thus be
modularized by directly inputting the undirected version of the graph
corresponding to the network (using the variable uG). The extent of
coarse-graining employed in a modularization may be controlled
using the variable Granularity. A full description of all input
variables is given in Sections 3 and 4 in Supplementary Material.

2.2 Outputs

Several outputs may be computed and plotted by MIDIA
when analyzing a biochemical reaction network. The Kinetic
Independence Graph (KIG, Section 5.2.2 in Supplementary
Material), is a fundamental, graphical description of the network’s
mass action kinetics and is needed for all subsequent outputs.
For each node (i.e. species), this directed graph displays those
other nodes whose copy number inﬂuences the instantaneous,
stochastic kinetics of that species (Bowsher, 2010, 2011). There
are two basic types of modularization that serve as MIDIA
outputs (Section 5.2.3 in Supplementary Material)—those based
on instantaneous or local kinetics alone (TMI), and those based
also on the dynamic conditional independence of modules (TM).
Both modularization types are represented and plotted by MIDIA
as (junction) trees. The second type, TM, is computed from the ﬁrst
and is the one that enables the analysis of information processing
properties. Finally, the Input—Output Path Matrix (Section 5.2.4
in Supplementary Material) is a powerful tool—complementary
to the tree structure TM—for Visualizing ‘routes’ of information
propagation between speciﬁed input—output pairs or between pairs

The species in each rectangle and in its associated edges in the tree constitute
a single module of the decomposition. Each edge thus represents the overlap
of 2 particular modules. The species in the edges, 13% of all network species,
are identiﬁed by MIDIA as important kinetic intermediaries. Modules are
uniquely numbered and numbers of species are shown in parentheses. The
variables MODE and Granularity were set to COARSEGRAIN and 3 0,
respectively. No rectangle in the tree has species in common with an edge or
another rectangle. The comparable analysis using the version of YEASTNET
without multiple reaction compartments (data not shown) ﬁnds 12% of all
network species in the edges.

of modules of particular interest. The various output types and their
interpretation are discussed, together with illustrative examples and
sample code, in Sections 2 and 5.2 in Supplementary Material (see
also Sections 3 and 4 in Supplementary Material).

3 DISCUSSION

In order to illustrate the ability of the MIDIA software to
analyse large network reconstructions, it is applied here to
YEASTNET (V4.02, see www.comp-sys-bio.org/yeastnet), the
consensus reconstruction of yeast metabolism that builds on the
one published by Herrgard et al. (2008). For simplicity, attention
is focused on separate analysis of the largest, single connected
component, consisting of 1730 reactions and 1520 species. Figure 1
shows the modularization based on instantaneous kinetics, TM],
returned by MIDIA (run time of 2.1 h on a 2.5 GHZ, 3.5 GB RAM
laptop machine). The analysis identiﬁes, e.g. the particular 202 of
the 1520 species (13%) solely responsible for mediating kinetic
effects between the module rectangles that themselves contain the
vast majority of the network species (see caption also).

MIDIA is a powerful, user-friendly and extensible software tool
for computational analysis of information processing, dynamic
independence and modular architecture in biochemical networks,
including reaction networks that exhibit a wide range of stochastic
dynamics. A particular strength is that uncertainty about the network
structure and kinetics is accommodated in the following respects:
no knowledge of rate parameters is required; partial stoichiometric
information alone needs to be used as input (exact stoichiometries
are not needed); and the false inclusion of reactions in the network
speciﬁcation invalidates neither the information processing analysis
nor the computed modularizations.

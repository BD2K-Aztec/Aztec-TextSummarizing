ABSTRACT

Summary: TREAT (Iargeted ﬁ-sequencing Annotation Iool) is
a tool for facile navigation and mining of the variants from both
targeted resequencing and whole exome sequencing. It provides a
rich integration of publicly available as well as in-house developed
annotations and visualizations for variants, variant-hosting genes and
host-gene pathways.

Availability and implementation: TREAT is freely available to
non-commercial users as either a stand-alone annotation and
visualization tool, or as a comprehensive workflow integrating
sequencing alignment and variant calling. The executables,
instructions and the Amazon Cloud Images of TREAT can be
downloaded at the website: http://ndc.mayo.edu/mayo/research/
biostat/stand-alone—packages.cfm

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing offers the promise of scientiﬁc
discovery with the challenge of results interpretation (Schuster,
2008). One experiment such as exome sequencing can generate
tens of thousands of single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and small
insertions or deletions (INDELs), which must be elucidated in the
search for disease associated mutations (Ansorge, 2009; Metzker,
2010). Whole exome sequencing is an application of NGS that
has been successfully used to identify disease-associated variants
in several monogenic disorders (Gilissen et al., 2010; Lupski
et al., 2010; Ng et al., 2009, 2010) and complex diseases
(Bonnefond et al., 2010; Harbour et al., 2010). While these studies
demonstrated the power of NGS, they also highlighted the challenge
of efﬁciently sifting through thousands of variants to identify a
subset that is potentially clinically relevant. Bioinformatics solutions
are beginning to be released that address this challenge and
facilitate ﬁltering and interpretation of human sequence variation

data (Nix et al., 2010; Sana et al., 2011; Shetty et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2010). We developed TREAT to extend the functionality of
these tools and directly integrated structured and sortable formats
with embedded hyperlinks to sequence alignment, gene speciﬁcity
and gene pathway visualizations. In addition, to enable broad
accessibility, we have fully deployed TREAT to the Amazon Cloud.
TREAT is optionally offered as part of a complete workﬂow for
exome or targeted sequencing, providing users with a convenient
method for integrated sequence alignment, mutation detection and
results interpretation. We believe this tool offers investigators with
an accessible and convenient method for annotating and visualizing
sequencing data and a means of efﬁciently identifying variants of
interest.

2 METHODS AND RESULTS

2.1 Variant annotation

TREAT provides four categories of variant annotations (Supplementary
Figure SI): (i) the general variant annotations which provide the physical
locations, and the dbSNP IDs and allele frequencies of known variants from
HapMap and 1000 Genome Pilot Project in Caucasian (CEU), Yoruban (YRI)
and East Asian (CHB/JPT) populations; (ii) sample-speciﬁc read depths
supporting A, C, G, T bases at each variant position, and the quality scores
for base calls and read mappings. These annotations are only available
when the users choose to use TREAT for read alignment and variant
calling; (iii) publically available annotations from SIFT (Kumar et al. , 2009)
and SeattleSeq (http://gvs.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSqunnotationl) that
include variant classiﬁcations (synonymous, missense, non-sense, frame-
shift, etc.) and the predictions of the functional impact of the variants from
SIFT and PolyPhen2 and (iv) in-house developed novel annotations including
the tissue expression speciﬁcity measures for variant-hosting genes (detailed
in Supplementary Data S2), and the identiﬁcation of variants adjacent
to exon—intron boundaries that potentially disrupt known splice-sites. An
additional novel function of TREAT is the hyperlinks of each variant hosting
gene to its associated KEGG pathway(s) (http://www.genome.jp/kegg) and
Gene Ontology terms (http://www.geneontologyorgl).

2.2 Reporting and visualization

TREAT automatically creates output in one easy-to-navigate HTML page,
which provides the project description, QC reports, target coverage and
sequencing depth information, descriptions of the annotations provided by
TREAT, and links to the SNV and INDEL reports. The Microsoft Excel
formatted SNV and INDEL reports provide row-based synopses of per-
variant annotation. Each variant is hyperlinked to Integrative Genomics

Viewer (IGV) (Robinson et al., 2011) for the visualization of read alignments
and variant calling information at the variant position. The functions of the
variant hosting genes are illustrated via hyperlinks to the KEGG pathways
and Gene Ontology terms, and the tissue expression speciﬁcity graph.

2.3 Access

TREAT is deployed in two formats, a standalone annotation application
and an integrated version for an end-to-end analysis of exome or targeted
sequencing data. The standalone annotation tool takes the list of called
variants as input ﬁles and allows users the ﬂexibility of generating the
variants using alignment and variant calling tools of their own choosing.
The integrated version accepts either FASTQ or BAM ﬁles as input ﬁles
and carries out sequence alignment using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009)
or Bowie (Langmead et al., 2009), local sequence re—alignment (GATK;
McKenna et al., 2010) and variant calling (GATK or SNVMix; Goya
et al., 2010), which provides users with a convenient solution to their
informatics needs. Both TREAT versions can be downloaded for local
runs, or can be launched on the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2)
(http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Elastic_Compute_Cloud) using
Amazon Machine Images provided at our Website. The Machine Images
are loaded with all the open-source tools and necessary annotation ﬁles for
the direct execution of TREAT. The run time and cost estimate of TREAT
Cloud version are provided in the Supplementary Data.

3 DISCUSSIONS

We have developed a bioinformatics tool, TREAT, which addresses
the current challenges in analyzing and interpreting targeted and
whole exome sequencing data. The annotations provided by TREAT
have been carefully evaluated and selected from a pool of available
open source tools and databases, and complimented by additional in—
house developed annotations (details at the TREAT website). The
variant reports in Excel format integrate the visualizations of the
sequence alignment at variant positions, pathways and expression
speciﬁcity of the variant hosting genes via clickable hyperlinks for
each reported INDELs and SNVs. In addition, the summary of the
targeted resequencing results is stored in a centralized HTML report
with links to the TREAT website, the targeted region coverage report
and the read QC report, the description of the TREAT workﬂow, and
links to the website of the annotation tools and databases.

For maximum ﬂexibility, two versions of TREAT were
implemented: an annotation only version, and a version integrating
read alignment, variant calling and annotations. Both versions can
be downloaded as local installations or as Amazon Cloud images
which makes TREAT available for users with no access to local
bioinformatics infrastructures. By targeting all user groups and
enabling rapid integration of emerging analytic methods, we believe
that TREAT provides a sustainable NGS analytic workﬂow with
wide applicability to the research community.

We plan to continue adding new functionality and features
to TREAT to make it a comprehensive tool for targeted and
exome analysis. These include the development of an in—house
variant database that collects all variants detected from hundreds of
individuals with various types of diseases using exome and whole
genome sequencing. This database will provide critical annotations
whether the observed variants are truly ‘novel’ or disease speciﬁc.
In addition, we are in the process of making TREAT applicable to
whole genome sequencing data analysis, this would require adding
annotation tracks for non-coding regions such as the conservations
and regulatory domains.

In summary, the rich set of annotations provided by TREAT, the
easy to use, centralized HTML summary report, and the Excel—
formatted variant reports with hyperlinked visualization utilities
enable the ﬁltering of detected variants based on their functional
characteristics, and allow the researchers to navigate, ﬁlter and
elucidate tens of thousands of variants to focus on potential
disease-associated variant(s).

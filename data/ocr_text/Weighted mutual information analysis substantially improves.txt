Abstract

Motivation: Functional protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks elucidate molecular pathways
underlying complex phenotypes, including those of human diseases. Extrapolation of domain—do—
main interactions (DDls) from known PPIs is a major domain—based method for inferring functional
PPI networks. However, the protein domain is a functional unit of the protein. Therefore, we should
be able to effectively infer functional interactions between proteins based on the co—occurrence of
domains.

Results: Here, we present a method for inferring accurate functional PPIs based on the similarity of
domain composition between proteins by weighted mutual information (Ml) that assigned different
weights to the domains based on their genome—wide frequencies. Weighted Ml outperforms other
domain—based network inference methods and is highly predictive for pathways as well as pheno—
types. A genome—scale human functional network determined by our method reveals numerous
communities that are significantly associated with known pathways and diseases. Domain—based
functional networks may, therefore, have potential applications in mapping domain—to—pathway or
domain—to—phenotype associations.

on the domain profile matrix is available from wmnN.netbio|ab.org/WNVMI.

1 Introduction

Proteins are major functional molecules that conduct cellular proc—
esses. Interactions between proteins are important for understanding
the molecular mechanisms of complex traits, including diseases. For
example, network—based analysis has recently gained popularity in
interpreting data from genome—wide association studies (GWAS)
and whole exome sequencing (WES) for human diseases such as can—
cer (Krogan et 61]., 2015; Leiserson et 61]., 2013; Mutation and
Pathway Analysis working group of the International Cancer
Genome Consortium, 2015 ; Shim and Lee, 2015). Although a large
number of protein—protein interactions (PPIs) have been mapped via
experimental detection of physical interactions between proteins, in

silica methods are still useful for inferring functional PPIs (Rao
et 61]., 2014) because proteins may work cooperatively without phys—
ical interaction.

Interactions between proteins are typically mediated by domain—
domain interactions (DDIs); thus, protein domains can be used to
infer PPIs (Deng et al., 2002; Reimand et 61]., 2012; Sprinzak and
Margalit, 2001; Wojcik and Schachter, 2001). Indeed, frequently
observed domain pairs between interacting proteins have been iden—
tified as powerful predictors of PPIs (Deng et 61]., 2002; Sprinzak
and Margalit, 2001). These observations have motivated the system—
atic extraction of DDIs from known PPIs and extrapolation to new
PPIs. Many algorithms have been developed to extract DDIs from

PPIs, as well as to infer new PPIs based on these DDIs, which have
been collected into meta—databases (Kim et 61]., 2012; Yellaboina
et al., 2011).

Functional PPIs can also be inferred from shared domains be—
tween proteins because protein domains are structural, functional
and evolutionary units of proteins. In addition, because proteins
evolved through gene duplication, recombination, fusion and fission
towards specific functions, there exist limited rules for domain com-
bination (Chothia et 61]., 2003; Moore et 61]., 2008). However, the
presence of shared domains between proteins may not be a sufficient
model of functional PPIs. For example, a DNA-binding domain
exists in most transcription factors, which regulate many different
biological processes. Thus, such a shared domain between two pro—
teins may not be a strong indicator of their functional association
with the same pathway. Therefore, we do not expect the prediction
of functional PPIs based on domain sharing to be effective. There
exists a need for a method to infer functional associations between
proteins based on domain co—occurrence.

In this study, we propose a method to infer PPIs based on do—
main occurrence. Any protein can be represented by a domain pro—
file, which is a vector reﬂecting the presence or absence of domains.
Functional associations between proteins are then measured by the
similarity between their domain profiles. Unlike DDI-based infer-
ence of PPIs, this approach does not require prior knowledge of the
PPIs from which the DDIs are extracted. In addition, to measure do—
main profile similarity with higher functional relevance, we wanted
to account for unequal distribution of functional information con-
tent across profiles and domains. Mutual information (MI) differen-
tially compares profile information based on their entropy. We
hypothesized that rarer domains tended to be involved in more spe—
cific pathways. Therefore, in addition to traditional MI, we tested a
weighted MI method that assigned different weights to domains
based on their genome—wide frequencies. Here, we demonstrate that
weighted MI outperforms traditional MI in the inference of func-
tional PPIs based on domain profile similarity in both yeast and
human. We also found that domain profile similarity by weighted
MI constructs substantially improved functional networks compared
to those based on DDIs. Our domain—based network inference
method constructed highly predictive functional networks for com-
plex phenotypes such as human diseases. Finally, we observed
that communities of our domain—based network are significantly
associated with known pathways or diseases, implicating a potential
application of domain—based functional networks in mapping associ—
ations between domains and pathways/diseases.

2 Methods

2.1 Pathway and phenotype annotation sets

Inferred functional PPI networks were analyzed using various path—
way or phenotype annotations. For pathway analysis, we used Gene
Ontology Consortium (2013) biological process (GOBP) annota—
tions for yeast and human. For yeast phenotype analysis, we used a
set of literature—based annotations of yeast genes for 100 knockout
(KO) phenotypes (McGary et 61]., 2007). For human phenotype ana—
lysis, two disease gene databases were used: Online Mendelian
Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (Amberger et 61]., 2015) and Disease
Ontology (DO) (Kibbe et 61]., 2015).

2.2 Generation of domain profiles for proteins
The InterPro database (Mitchell et 61]., 2015) (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/
interpro), which collects domain annotations from diverse sources,

includes over 20 000 entries. We downloaded InterPro entries (v38)
for yeast and human proteins via BioMart, and generated domain
profiles for 17 013 and 4921 proteins using 8362 and 4261 domains
for human and yeast, respectively. A stack of domain profiles, i.e. a
protein—domain matrix, was defined as follows:

DEFINITION 1: Protein—domain matrix M

Given 11 proteins and m domains, let a protein—domain matrix
M : [cij] be an n X m matrix whose elements 6,,- indicate the presence
or absence of a domain d,- within a protein [9,- as follows:

{1, if protein [9,- contains domain d,-
Cil' =

0, otherwise

2.3 Inference of functional PPIs by Ml analysis

Given a protein—domain matrix, the functional association between
two proteins can be measured using MI analysis, which measures
the mutual dependence between two discrete random variables (e.g.
domain profiles) as described in Definition 2.

DEFINITION 2: MI I
Given two discrete random variables X and Y,

1(x, Y) = H(X) + H(Y) — H(x, Y)

where H(X), which represents the entropy (i.e. measure of uncer—
tainty) of random variable X, and H (X, Y) represents the joint en—
tropy between discrete random variables X and Y with joint
distribution [)(X, Y). H(X), H(Y) and H(X, Y) defined as:

mm = — 2f: poo) Jog poo)
W) = — ngpm) Jog pm)

kx ky
H(X7 Y) Z _ 21:1 Zi=1P(Xi= Yi) ‘log 19(Xiv Yi)

where [ex and lay are the cardinality of the outcomes of X and Y,
respectively.

Higher MI results when the entropy of each random variable is
high and the relative entropy between two random variables is low.
In addition to traditional MI, we tested weighted MI, which adds
more weight to the rarer profile features, as described in the follow—
ing definitions:

DEFINITION 3: Domain-specific weight
Given the n—by—m protein—domain matrix M, the domain-
specific weight co,- for each domain j is defined as:

where 6,,- denotes the value of the indicated cell in matrix M.

DEFINITION 4: Weighted MI I a,
Given two proteins X and Y,

1,,(x, Y) = Ha,(X) + Hw(Y) — Hw(X, Y)

where Ha, (X) and Hw(Y) represent the weighted entropy of protein
X and protein Y, respectively, and can be calculated as follows:

2.4 Functional PPI inference based on DDI

Based on the rationale that domains mediate interactions between
proteins, PPIs can be inferred by DDIs. Various algorithms have
been applied to extract DDIs from known PPIs. These DDIs have
been deposited into databases such as DOMINE (Yellaboina et al.,
2011), which collects DDIs from 15 different sources of evidence.
Assuming that DDIs from different sources are independent, we as—
signed a weight to each DDI based on the number of sources; thus,
this weight ranged from 0 to 15. The score of a functional inter—
action between protein i and protein 1', which is Often mediated by
multiple DDIs, was calculated using the following definition:

DEFINITION 5: The score of each PPI mediated by multiple DDIs
was defined as

Si)" 2% Z 0141/

uEi, UEi

where 0m, is the weight of a DDI between domain a and domain 11
and N is the number of DDIs involved in the interaction between
proteins i and j with weight greater than zero.

2.5 Likelihood of inferred functional PPIs

The functional significance of each inferred PPI was measured by
the log likelihood score (LLS), which is based on a Bayesian statistics
framework as described previously (Lee et al., 2004). LLS is defined
as follows:

LLS = 1n 

P (L)/ P (*L)

where P(L|E) and P(u—L|E) represent the frequencies of positive (L)
and negative (u—L) gold standard pathway links observed in the
given source of evidence (E), and P(L) and P(u—L) represent the prior
expectations (i.e. the total frequencies of all positive and negative
gold standard pathway gene pairs, respectively). To avoid over—
fitting, we used ‘0.632 bootstrapping’ for all LLS calculations due
to its credibility in estimating classifier error rates. For this study,
gold standard pathway links were generated by pairing two proteins
annotated for the same GOBP terms.

3 Results

3.1 Overview of weighted Ml to infer functional PPIs
from domain profiles

Given that domains are functional units of proteins, the functions of
a protein can be represented by its domain composition. We sum—
marized protein functions as profiles of binary scores that indicate

the presence or absence of a given domain. These domain profiles
can then be used to infer functional associations between proteins
based on their similarity. In this study, we generated domain profiles
for proteins using domains registered to a comprehensive domain
database, InterPrO, as of May 2014 (Mitchell et al., 2015 ).
Figure 1A illustrates an example of a protein—domain matrix com—
posed Of multiple domain profiles. Domain profiles are generally
sparse because most proteins contain only a few of the several thou—
sand domains annotated in the InterPro database. For example,
~22% and ~40% of proteins annotated by InterPro contain a single
domain in human and yeast. Meanwhile, only 2% and 0.25% of
proteins contain ten or more domains in human and yeast, respect—
ively (Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. 81A). TO measure profile simi-
larity with high functional relevance, we took into account the
unequal distribution of information content across different do—
mains and domain profiles. As shown in Figure 1A, two questions
about non-uniformity in information content need to be addressed
when measuring profile similarity: (i) Which domain profile is more
informative? (ii) Which domain is more informative?

To address the first question of non—uniform information content
across domain profiles, we employed MI, which accounts for the en—
tropy within a profile via the similarity measure; profiles with higher
entropy are more informative. Using information theory, MI de—
scribes how much information is shared between two variables (e.g.
two domain profiles). Whereas most commonly used correlation co—
efficient measures, such as Pearson’s (r), Spearman’s (p) and
Kendall’s (T), can only measure linear relationships (monotonic rela—
tionship) between two variables, MI can measure nonlinear depend—
encies. Therefore, there is no need to specify a theoretical
probability distribution or use a mean—variance model to account
for non—linear dependencies. In the case of the domain profile, the
rate of occurrence change between two proteins is not constant for
the entire range of proteins or their component domains. Moreover,
MI accounts for the individual entropy of each input, as well as the
joint entropy between two variables, which is advantageous in the
case of very sparse profiles.

Unequal distribution of information content among domains is
illustrated by the power—law distribution of domain occurrence
among proteins. From this, we hypothesized that rare domains are
associated with relatively specific biological processes while com—
monly occurring domains contribute to diverse functions (Fig. 1C
and Supplementary Fig. S1B). For example, the zinc finger C2H2-
like (IPR015 880) domain occurs in 793 proteins and plays a role in
binding DNA, RNA, protein and/or lipid substrates, such as zinc ion
binding and nucleic acid binding. Even if a protein containing the
zinc finger domain acts as a core transcription factor, it is difficult to
assert that zinc finger domains are associated with a specific path—
way. Therefore, we assigned higher weights to the rarer domains
during MI calculation based on the assumption that rarer domains
have higher information content or pathway specificity (see
Definition 4). A similar approach for image registration, in which
spatially weighted MI analysis accounted for differential medical im-
portance (Park et al., 2010; Patel et al., 2011; Suh et al., 2010) or
pixel contribution (Rivaz and Collins, 2012; Zhuang et al., 2011),
was shown to be superior to traditional MI analysis.

Fig. 1. Summary of weighted Ml analysis to infer domain-based functional associations between genes. (A) An illustration of a protein—domain matrix composed
of six proteins (p1—p5) and five domains (d1—d5). Each cell of the matrix has a value of 1 if the given domain exists in the protein, and a value of 0 in all other cases.
The distribution of domain occurrence (i.e. domain profiles) are different across proteins. Some domain profiles are more informative than others, and entropy
can be used to measure the information content, in which high entropy reflects more informative profiles. Information content across domains is not distributed
uniformly. Some domains are associated with more specific functions than others. In general, the more rare the domain, the more informative it is. (B) The distri-
bution of the number of human proteins harbouring k domains. The distribution indicates that most human proteins have only a few domains, and that only a

PPIs inferred from domain profile similarity by weighted MI.
Homologous proteins generate similar domain profiles. To infer
functional PPIs based on domain profile similarity rather than se-
quence similarity, we excluded paralogous protein pairs (defined by
a blastp E—value threshold of 10 T 3) from all domain—based PPI net-
works. The likelihood that two proteins participate in the same
GOBP pathway was measured for every bin of 1000 PPIs ordered
from the highest edge score (i.e. from the MI, weighted MI or DDI-
based score). If the LLS was greater than zero, the two proteins were
more likely to be associated functionally than expected at random.
For example, networks inferred from domain profile similarity by
weighted MI have 12 000 and 94 000 PPIs before the first bin of
1000 PPIs with negative LLS for yeast and human, respectively.

To test the inference power of each domain—based score for func—
tional PPIs, we performed regression analysis between domain—
based scores and LLS of protein pairs that share GOBP pathway an—
notations. Functional PPIs by shared domains were excluded from
this analysis because they were based on binary edge scores, which
were not sortable for regression analysis. We tested regressions for
the top 15 000 and 200 000 PPIs for all yeast and human networks,

respectively. PPI networks were fitted by a sigmoid or linear func-
tion. Based on the best—fit relationships for each network, we found
that weighted MI was the best regression model for functional PPIs
in both yeast and human (Fig. 2).

Next, we assessed functional PPI networks by precision-recall
analysis, in which we defined recall as the coverage of the coding gen—
ome and precision was defined as the probability that the inferred
PPIs shared pathway annotations in GOBP. We found that functional
PPI networks inferred from domain profile similarity by weighted MI
outperformed all other domain—based networks for both yeast and
human (Fig. 3). Functional PPIs based on the presence of shared do—
mains between proteins generated the largest PPI networks, which
also covered the largest number of coding genes, but with low preci—
sion. Functional PPIs based on DDIs or domain profile similarity by
traditional MI covered fewer coding genomes. In addition, precision
was higher than functional PPIs based on the presence of shared do—
mains, but less than that of weighted MI. Notably, confident net—
works of 12 000 and 94 000 PPIs by weighted MI covered 45% and
65% of coding genomes in yeast and human, respectively. Therefore,
we concluded that domain profile similarity by weighted MI is the
best domain—based PPI inference method and can be used to construct
genome—scale functional networks in humans.

3.3 Functional PPIs based on domain profile similarity
are highly predictive for complex phenotypes

Recently, network—based analysis of candidate genes has become
more popular in the genetic dissection of complex phenotypes such
as human diseases. For example, PPI networks predictive for human
diseases have been used to identify novel disease genes by network
association with known disease genes, network—based prioritization
candidates within susceptible diseases in the same chromosomal re—
gion or GWAS loci. Moreover, PPI networks have been applied to
disease modules by searching for subnetworks enriched for patient-
specific mutations or disease—associated single nucleotide poly—
morphisms (SNPs) (Barabasi et al., 2011; Jia and Zhao, 2014;
Leiserson et al., 2013; Mutation and Pathway Analysis working
group of the International Cancer Genome Consortium, 2015; Shim
and Lee, 2015 ). To test the capability of domain—based functional
PPI networks for studying complex phenotypes, we assessed the pre—
cision of the networks for connecting proteins that share phenotypes
in yeast and humans. Using similar precision—recall analyses as those
used to test the predictive power for GOBP pathways, we found that
using functional PPIs inferred from domain profile similarity by
weighted MI is highly predictive of both yeast KO phenotypes and
human diseases in the OMIM database (Fig. 4). These results dem—
onstrate that domain—based functional PPI networks are highly pre-
dictive for pathways as well as phenotypes, suggesting that they can
be applied towards network—based analysis of complex phenotypes,
including human diseases.

3.4 Domain—based human functional PPIs elucidate net—
work communities associated with pathways and
diseases

The high likelihood of an association between proteins involved in
the same pathways may allow genome—scale reconstruction of func—
tional modules represented as network communities. Using CFinder
(Derenyi et al., 2005), a software that identifies network commun—
ities with overlaps, we searched for all 10 clique—connected sub—
graphs in the human functional network of 94 000 confident PPIs
based on domain profile similarity by weighted MI. A total of 430
communities were identified. We tested these communities for their
association with GOBP and DO—Lite gene sets by Fisher’s exact test.
Using a criterion of P < 0.01, at least three member genes for the test
pathway or disease set and at least two overlapped genes between
communities and gene sets, we found that 282 (65 %) and 198

(46%) of 430 communities are significantly associated with at least
one GOBP pathway and DO—Lite disease, respectively. These results
suggest that domain—based network communities tend to be signifi-
cantly associated with pathways or diseases, implicating the poten—
tial application of domain—based functional networks in mapping
domain—to—pathway and domain—to—disease associations.

Figure 5 shows 16 of the 20 communities with the strongest asso—
ciation with pathways or diseases in the largest component of the
domain—based functional network, which contained 61 133 links
among 5676 coding genes. Among the 16 communities, 15 and 10
were significantly associated with GOBP terms (Fig. 5A and
Supplementary Table S1) and DO—Lite terms (Fig. 5B and
Supplementary Table S2), respectively. Notably, some communities
were associated with diseases and their relevant biological processes.
For example, two enriched diseases for community C4 (i.e. 4th larg-
est community), epidermolysis bullosa (P : 1.38e—07) and ectoder—
mal dysplasia (P : 1.91e—06), are likely to be inﬂuenced by
epidermis development (P: 1.84e—27) and ectoderm development
(P : 1.91e—06), which are also significantly enriched for C4. As an-
other example, the pathway set linked to the perception of sound
(P : 1.08e—03) and the disease set for deafness (P : 2.76e—04) were
identified as associated significantly with C20. Furthermore, a path—
way term for the antimicrobial humoral response (P 25.21e—04),
as well as a disease term for infection by Cryptococcus neoformans
(P=7.71e—07), were enriched for C18. Many other communities
connected diseases and pathways whose relationships are less obvi—
ous, but implicated by previous studies. For example, C1 was associ—
ated with blood coagulation (P : 3.49e—08) and macular
degeneration (P 22.07e—05); a relationship between anticoagulant

Fig. 5. Major communities of a human domain-based functional network. The
largest component of the human domain-based network by weighted Ml
(90000 links) contains 61 133 links among 5676 coding genes. Among the 20
largest communities identified by CFinder analysis, 16 were included in the
largest component network. A few significantly associated GOBP terms (A)
and DO-Lite terms (B) for each community are listed along with their signifi-

medication and massive intraocular haemorrhage in age—related
macular degeneration has previously been reported (Tilanus et al.,
2000). As another example, community C8 was associated with the
lipid metabolic process (P : 1.09e—03) and Cushing syndrome
(P=3.28e—06); elevated triglyceride levels have been observed in
patients with Cushing syndrome (Chanson and Salenave, 2010).
Furthermore, C13 was associated with the integrin—mediated signal—
ling pathway (P:5.15e—07) and polyarthritis (P=1.74e—03); a
significant contribution of integrin to inﬂammatory cartilage de—
struction has previously been reported (Peters et al., 2012). Finally,
C18 was associated with cell adhesion (P 24.98e—05) and
Pseudoxanthoma elasticum infection (P = 6 .63e—09); elevated levels
of the cell adhesion molecule P—selectin have been observed in pa—
tients infected with Relasticum (Gotting et al., 2008). These results
demonstrate the usefulness of domain—based functional networks for
studying the underlying molecular mechanisms of diseases.

We also compared communities of PPI networks, one by domain
profile similarity based on WMI and the other by DDI—based infer—
ences. We found that the WMI—based network gives substantially
more communities with much smaller range of size distribution, and
more communities that are associated with diseases or pathways
among top 20 communities (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating su—
periority of WMI—based network over DDI—based network in recon—
structing functional and disease modules.

4 Discussion

The protein domain is a widely accepted functional unit of proteins.
Thus, domains can be expected to convey information about the
pathways and phenotypes proteins are involved in. However, the
use of domains to predict these pathways and phenotypes based on
domain occurrence remains limited. Many domains are associated
with multiple pathways that are involved in distinct physiological
processes. Therefore, domain occurrence may not be a sufficient in-
dicator of domain involvement in specific pathways or phenotypes.
Furthermore, some domains appear to be basic components of a
large number of proteins. Therefore, domain—based pathway model—
ling has been challenging. In this study, we demonstrated the feasi—
bility of constructing highly predictive functional PPI networks for
pathways and diseases using an information theory approach with
differential weights across domains. However, despite superior ac—
curacy, PPI networks by weighted MI exhibit smaller genome cover—
age than those derived by simple domain sharing, which indicates
that many domains are general—purpose components of proteins that
do not indicate any specific pathways. These observations suggest
that we may be able to use domain—based networks to distinguish
domains involved in specific pathways from those that participate in
general processes. This enables more reliable pathway prediction
based on domain information.

Although we demonstrated the utility of weighted MI to con—
struct domain—based functional PPI for yeast and human in this
study, the same method can be easily applied to other organisms and
may potentially benefit relatively lesser understood organisms for
which only protein sequences with electronic annotation of domains
are available.

We also demonstrated that human domain—based network com—
munities tend to be associated with pathways and diseases, suggest—
ing a potential application for domain—based functional networks in
mapping domain—to—pathway and domain—to—disease associations.
Although we have made vast progress in in silico models to identify
associated pathways and diseases for genes, models using domains

as indicators remain are less developed. Given that the domain is a
more fundamental functional unit of proteins, pathway or disease
annotation for each domain would be more relevant to the genome.
Therefore, significant efforts have been invested into the manual
curation of relationships between domains and pathways, such as
InterPr02GO (Burge et al., 2012). We anticipate that the develop—
ment of an automatic mapper of domains to GOBP terms will accel—
erate this manual curation project. In addition, the prediction of
domain—to—disease associations will provide new insights into the
analysis of disease—specific genomics data, such as disease—associated
SNPs and mutations, which potentially opens new routes to under—
standing the molecular mechanisms of human diseases in the future.

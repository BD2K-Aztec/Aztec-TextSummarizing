Abstract

Motivation: Protein function depends on its structural stability. The effects of single point vari-
ations on protein stability can elucidate the molecular mechanisms of human diseases and help in
developing new drugs. Recently, we introduced INPS, a method suited to predict the effect of vari-
ations on protein stability from protein sequence and whose performance is competitive with the
available state-of—the-art tools.

Results: In this article, we describe INPS-MD (Impact of Non synonymous variations on Protein
Stability-Multi-Dimension), a web server for the prediction of protein stability changes upon single
point variation from protein sequence and/or structure. Here, we complement INPS with a new pre-
dictor (INPS3D) that exploits features derived from protein 3D structure. INPS3D scores with
Pearson’s correlation to experimental AAG values of 0.58 in cross validation and of 0.72 on a blind
test set. The sequence-based INPS scores slightly lower than the structure-based INPS3D and both
on the same blind test sets well compare with the state-of—the-art methods.

Availability and Implementation: INPS and INPS3D are available at the same web server: http://
inpsmd.biocomp.unibo.it.

1 Introduction

Stability of protein variants may or may not be different for wild type.
This information is relevant to understand the relation between pro-
tein variants and insurgence of diseases (Ashley, 2015; Lu et al.,
2014). Several methods have been developed so far to predict stability
change in protein variants, either based on protein sequence or struc-
ture features (Folkman et al., 2016; Huang et al., 2007; Laimer et al.,
2016; Pires et al., 2014; Teng et al., 2010). Recently we developed
INPS (Fariselli et al., 2015), a sequence-based method devised to pre-
dict protein stability change (AAG) upon single-point variations, well
comparing with the state-of-the-art methods. Here we present a web
server, INPS-MD that includes the sequence-based INPS, and a new

method INPS3D, exploiting descriptors derived from the protein 3D
structure. Benchmark results, performed on two experimentally
derived datasets of variations, show that the structure-based INPS-3D
performs better than the sequence-based INPS when predicting the
change in protein stability upon variation. INPS-MD is available at
http://inpsmd.biocomp.unibo.it.

2 INPS3D

INPS (Fariselli et al., 2015) is based on descriptors extracted from
the protein sequence. Briefly, seven features are used to encode a sin-
gle-point mutation: (i) the substitution score w —> m derived from

the Blosum62 matrix (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992); (ii) the Kyte—
Doolittle hydrophobicity (Kyte and Doolittle, 1982) scores of native
and changed residues (two descriptors); (iii) the mutability index of
the native residue (Dayhoff et al., 1978); (iv) the molecular weights
of native and changed residues (two descriptors); (v) the difference
in the alignment score between the native and variant sequences and
a HMM, encoding evolutionary information of the wild type se-
quence (Fariselli et al., 2015). Sequence descriptors are mapped to
AAG values using a Support Vector Regression (Chang et al., 2011)
with a radial basis function kernel. In INPS3D, the set of INPS de-
scriptors also includes features derived from protein 3D structure. In
particular, the following two additional structure-based descriptors
are considered: (i) one descriptor corresponding to the Relative
Solvent Accessibility (RSA) of the native residue. The absolute solv-
ent accessibility is computed from the PDB file using the DSSP
method (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) and then normalized as previ-
ously described in Rost and Sander (1994); (ii) another descriptor
encodes for the local energy difference (ED) between native and
mutated protein structures. The energy is computed by means of a
contact potential previously described in Bastolla et al. (2001).
Given the set n of neighbors of the changed residue (two residues are
considered in contact if the minimal distance between all atoms is
<5 A), the contact ED is scored as:

ZreNPQ, w) — P(r, m) (1)

where w and m are, respectively, the native and the mutated resi-
dues, and P is the contact potential defined over pair of residues
(Bastolla et al., 2001).

2.1 Web server usage

INPS and INPS3D are included in INPS-MD, available at http://
inpsmd.biocomp.unibo.it. Here, the user can select the sequence-
based INPS or the structure-based INPS3D, when the protein struc-
ture is available. In both cases, the user must provide input files and
parameters through the input submission form: (i) the query protein
in the form of a single FASTA file in the case of INPS, or a valid
PDB file in the case of INPS3D. In the latter case, the target PDB
chain ID must be specified; (ii) a single file containing the list of
point variations relative to the sequence or PDB chain. Upon sub-
mission, the server provides the user with a universal job identifier
that can be thereafter used to retrieve results. For each variation
listed in the input file, the server computes protein descriptors and
performs AAG predictions. Upon job completion, results can be
visualized online or downloaded in plain-text format.

3 Results and conclusion

INPS and INPS3D are benchmarked on three different sets previ-
ously released (Pires et al., 2014): (i) the 52648 dataset, comprising
2648 single-point mutations in 132 proteins derived from ProTherm
(Kumar et al., 2006), (ii) a subset of 52648 used as blind test set
comprising 351 variations in 60 proteins and (iii) a dataset of 42
variations within the DNA-binding domain of the tumor suppressor
protein P53. Table 1 lists results obtained for INPS and INPS3D
with a cross validation procedure on the first set and adopting the
remaining two as blind test sets. INPS3D outperforms INPS, achiev-
ing a Pearson’s correlation 7% points higher than INPS and a stand-
ard error of 0.1 kcal/mol smaller in AAG prediction. The relative
contribution of the two structural features indicates that RSA is
more informative than ED. Their combination leads to a further im-
provement in the performance (Pearson’s correlation is 0.5 8). INPS

and INPS3D predictions strongly correlate (Supplementary Figure
51) and well compare with the state-of— the-art predictors when
tested on the same datasets (see Supplementary Table 51). INPS3D
input includes information derived from multiple sequence align-
ment and its performance is dependent on the number of aligned se-
quences. INPS3D is less sensitive than INPS, and even when the
number of aligned sequences is <100, its Pearson’s correlation is still
0.5 (Supplementary Figure 52). 52648 dataset contains some redun-
dancy (44 proteins out of the 132 share >25% identity). In the most
stringent per-protein split (Pires et al. 2014), 16 pairs of proteins
have sequence similarity between the training and testing sets.
However, INPS and INPS3D seem unaffected by this redundancy,
since no differences in the cross-validation performances are de-
tected when the sequence similarity is removed. These cross-valid-
ation sets, together with the BLAST outputs, are available at the
web server page. INPS-MD is a new web server that integrates infor-
mation from sequence and structure to predict protein stability per-
turbation upon residue variations and allows the prediction in
multi-dimensions.

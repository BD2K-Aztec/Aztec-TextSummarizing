ABSTRACT

Motivation: Representing domain knowledge in biology has
traditionally been accomplished by creating simple hierarchies of
classes with textual annotations. Recently, expressive ontology
languages, such as Web Ontology Language, have become more
widely adopted, supporting axioms that express logical relationships
other than class—subclass, e.g. disjointness. This is improving the
coverage and validity of the knowledge contained in biological ontol-
ogies. However, current semantic tools still need to adapt to this more
expressive information. In this article, we propose a method to inte-
grate disjointness axioms, which are being incorporated in real-world
ontologies, such as the Gene Ontology and the chemical entities of
biological interest ontology, into semantic similarity, the measure that
estimates the closeness in meaning between classes.

Results: We present a modification of the measure of shared infor-
mation content, which extends the base measure to allow the incorp-
oration of disjointness information. To evaluate our approach, we
applied it to several randomly selected datasets extracted from the
chemical entities of biological interest ontology. In 93.8% of these
datasets, our measure performed better than the base measure of
shared information content. This supports the idea that semantic simi-
larity is more accurate if it extends beyond the hierarchy of classes of
the ontology.

1 INTRODUCTION

Semantic similarity has direct application to the class—subclass
hierarchy of many biomedical ontologies, such as the Gene
Ontology (GO; Lord et al., 2003), the chemical entities of biolo-
gical interest ontology (ChEBI; Ferreira and Couto, 2010) and
the human phenotype ontology (Kchler et al., 2009). Semantic
similarity assigns a quantitative measure of similarity between
two entities in an ontology, which has seen multiple applications

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

in semantic web and bioinformatics contexts (Grego and Couto,
2013).

The state-of—the-art in knowledge representation in the
biomedical domain is evolving to make use of ontology lan-
guages such as the Web Ontology Language (OWL). OWL
allows for more logically expressive axioms than the simple
class—subclass hierarchy and the relational statements favored
in early bio-ontology releases (McGuinness and van Harmelen,
2004). Following this trend, there is a need to adjust the current
similarity measures to conform to current practices in ontology
development (Couto and Pinto, 2013). Ontologies such as ChEBI
and G0 now contain disjointness axioms, which express for a
pair of classes the constraint that an instance of one of them
cannot also be an instance of the other [Although the terms
‘class’ and ‘concept’ are usually interchangeable in literature,
the former is favored by the Semantic Web and OWL language
communities and the latter by the description logic (DL) com-
munity. In this article, we use the term ‘class’.]. The constraint
also restricts subclasses from being a subclass of both of the
disjoint classes. If such shared instances or subclasses are de-
tected by an ontology reasoner, the reasoner will flag the ontol-
ogy as inconsistent, which can be used by ontology developers as
a validation step to prevent errors in ontology development.

In this article, we propose that disjointness axioms can also
enhance the information that is exploited by similarity measures.
Figure 1 illustrates this situation. In this snippet, it is stated that
no instance of Rectangle can simultaneously be an instance of
Trapezoid. However, given the open-world assumption that
underlies ontologies, there can be instances of Rectangle that
are also instances of Parallelogram (in fact, it is a consequence
of the relevant geometric definitions that all squares are both
rectangles and parallelograms). (Informally, the open-world as-
sumption states that what is not known to hold does not give any
information about what is known not to hold. One consequence
is that if an ontology does not contain subclasses for a given
class, it cannot be assumed that no such subclasses exist.) For
this reason, the similarity between Rectangle and Parallelogram
should intuitively be higher than the similarity between Rectangle
and Trapezoid. Using a to represent the two-argument function
that returns the similarity between two classes:

0(Rectangle, Parallelogram) > 0(Rec tangle, Trapezoid) (l)

Fig. 1. A snippet of a hypothetical shape ontology. Arrows represent
class—subclass relationships and dashed lines represent disjointness
axioms. We use the term Trapezoid to mean a quadrilateral with two par-
allel sides and two obtuse angles. Note that proper shape ontology would
classify Square as a subclass of Rectangle, Rhombus and Parallelogram.
However, for the sake of the argument being exposed, we assume that such
information is as yet unknown by the ontology creators

Several current semantic similarity measures make use of the
idea of information content (IC) applied to the classes of the
ontology (Resnik, 1995; Sanchez and Batet, 2011). The IC is a
number that reﬂects how speciﬁc the class is. For example, in the
illustration in Figure 1, Shape is the least speciﬁc class, receiving
a lower IC than the other classes. There have been many pro-
posals for how best to measure the IC of a class [See, e.g.
Seddiqui and Aono (2010) and Van Buggenhout and Ceusters
(2005)].

Another notion commonly used in semantic similarity is the
most informative common ancestor (MICA; Resnik, 1995). This
applies to a pair of classes x and y, and is deﬁned as the class
with the highest IC from the set of all ancestors of both x and y:

MICA(x, y) = arg maxc{IC(c) | c e A(x) ﬂ A(y)} (2)

where A(x) is the set of ancestors (super-classes) of x, including x.

The ﬁrst semantic similarity measure to make use of IC, by
Resnik (1995), estimates similarity as the IC of the MICA be-
tween x and y. The motivation behind this choice of the formula
is simple: x and y share a certain amount of information, and the
MICA is one way to estimate this shared information. Many
semantic similarity measures are based on this notion of shared
IC (Jiang and Conrath, 1997; Lin, 1998; Pesquita et al., 2008).
For example:

O‘Resnikocsa y) =  y» 

2 X IC(MICA(x, y))
IC(x) —I— IC(y)

On the other hand, work has been published recently showing
a new approach to the problem of ﬁnding the best way to meas-
ure shared IC between two classes. Although shared IC has been
assumed to be best estimated as IC(MICA(x, y)) (Resnik, 1995),
Couto and Silva (2011) suggest DiShIn, which behaves as an add-
on to the measure of IC, and contributes to a better measure of
shared IC by exploring multiple parentage to ensure that all the
shared information across multiple ancestors is taken into
account.

Just as was done for DiShIn, instead of proposing a semantic
similarity measure, we propose an add-on that can be used by
existing measures, such as the ones in Equations (3) and (4). Our
add-0n reﬁnes the estimation of shared information between the

two classes by incorporating the disjointness axioms in the ontol-
ogy. We call the new shared IC measure IC:lisj (x, y), which will be
based on a prior measure of shared IC, denoted by ICS(x, y). We
stress that any measure of shared IC can be used as a base to
ICES], not just the one proposed by Resnik, as is the case with
DiShIn.

Given the example presented in Figure l and the inequality of
Equation (1), it would be desirable for the measure of shared IC
to decrease for classes that are known to be disjoint, to formalize
the intuition that disjoint classes are less similar, as they cannot
share instances. Furthermore, to respect the open-world assump-
tion that often accompanies ontologies, the measure should stay
unchanged when two classes are not known to be disjoint.

With this novel measure of shared IC, we intend to show that
semantic similarity can take advantage of the disjointness axioms
of an ontology, thus providing evidence that future measures
should consider them in evaluating the closeness in meaning
between two classes.

2 CHEBI

For the evaluation of our proposal, we have computed shared IC
for ChEBI, the ontology of Chemical Entities of Biological
Interest (Degtyarenko et al., 2008). It is worth, as such, to intro-
duce the reader to the state of disjointness information that this
ontology includes. In the Open Biological and Biomedical
Ontologies community (in which ChEBI is embedded), there is
a tacit agreement that it is good practice to ensure that sibling
terms are mutually disjoint. This is, however, not the case for
ChEBI: mid-level chemical classes, which constitute most of
ChEBI, are generally not pairwise disjoint, as chemical classiﬁ-
cation is compositional, i.e. classes often reﬂect parts or proper-
ties of molecules that may co-occur in many different
combinations in fully speciﬁed molecules (Hastings et al., 2012b).

In an ontology of chemical compounds, a leaf class can, in
theory, be regarded as disjoint with the other leaf classes. For
example, a-D-glucose is disjoint with histidine. However, ChEBI
is not a complete ontology for chemistry, and some of the leaves
it contains do not follow this rule. For example, aminophospho-
lipid, deﬁned as ‘a phospholipid that contains one or more amino
groups’, is a leaf in ChEBI at present. However, this class rep-
resents the molecules that contain speciﬁc substructures and, as
such, it is not necessarily disjoint with the other leaves. Given
that ChEBI is a work in progress, where new knowledge is added
after careful manual duration, this has resulted in aminophospho-
lipid being presently a leaf. Other such cases can be found, ren-
dering even the theoretical rule that all leaves are disjoint not
applicable.

Thus, in what follows, we have not attempted to automatically
enhance the number of disjointness axioms available in ChEBI.
Rather, we have used only those axioms that have explicitly been
added to the ontology.

3 METHODS

3.1 Shared information using disjointness

We propose the new measure of shared IC:

ICZistcsy) = ICSOQJ’) — [C(Xsy) (5)

Disjointness in semantic similarity

 

 

Fig. 2. An illustration of an ontology containing disjointness axioms.
Arrows between classes represent class—subclass relationships and
dashed lines represent disjointness

where ICS(x, y) is any measure of shared IC between x and y, k(x, y) > 0 if
x and y are disjoint and k(x, y) = 0 otherwise.

Two points were crucial in the development of our measure.
First, we note that, as is, this equation presents a discontinuity. In the
hypothetical ontology of Figure 2, this measure leads to
ICiﬁsj(D,E)<IC(B). Depending on the value k(D, E), this could lead to
ICzisj(D,E)<IC(A) = ICiﬁsj(D,F), which, however, should not be pos-
sible, as D and E share more information than D and F. Therefore,
k was bounded according to the IC of the most informative ancestor of
the MICA, which, in this case, results in k(D, E) 5 IC(B) — IC(A).

The second major point associated with our measure is an operational
notion: the likelihood of two classes sharing ancestors that are not
asserted as such. We call this the potential for implicit common ancestors
(ICAs). Take as an example the ontology snippets of Figure 3. In situ-
ation B, given the open-world assumption, there is a small chance that Y
turns out to be a subclass of A”, while in situation A that cannot happen,
as Y is inferred to be disjoint with X’. This suggests that there is a lower
potential for ICA between the classes X and Y in situation A, as the
disjointness is declared between the direct subclasses of M.

Rather than modeling the potential for ICA, we model the unlikelihood
of ICA as the function f(x, )2), which returns higher values for situations
with lower potential for ICA:

1

f(xsy) maX{p(a’ b)

where A(x) is the set of ancestors of x (including x), J(a, b) is true when a

and b are disjoint (either by assertion of inference), and false otherwise

and p(a, b) is the length of the shortest path from a to b. The path length

takes into account only the class—subclass relations, not the disjointness
arcs (the dashed edges of the ﬁgures).

Using the example ontologies in Figure 3, we can illustrate this
deﬁnition by calculating f(X, Y). In B, J(a, b) is true only for
(a, b) = (X, Y); the shortest path from X to Y, using only class—subclass
relations, is X —> X’ —> M —> Y’ —> Y, which has length 4. Therefore,
f(X, Y) = max{%,0} = i. In A, J(a,b) is true for (a, b) e {(X, Y),
(X, Y’), (X’, Y), (X’, Y’)}. These correspond to paths of length {4, 3, 3, 2},
respectively, leading to f(X, Y) = max{%, %, %, 0} =  Finally, for non-

|aeAQjAbeAQ)AKdM}Um} (e

disjoint terms, such as A” and Y’ in situation B, J(a,b) is always false:
therefore, the ﬁrst set of the union becomes empty, resulting in

f(xsy) = 
The general procedure to calculate ICzistc, y) is, therefore:
(1) Determine M = MICA(X, y);

(2) Determine Z = arg maxC{IC(c) | c e A(M)}, i.e. the most inform-
ative ancestor of M;

 

Fig. 3. This image illustrates the notion of the potential for ICAs between
two classes. In both cases, MICA(X, Y) = M, and the most informative
ancestor of M is Z. The difference is in the location of the disjointness
axiom. In situation A, there is a lower likelihood of ICA between X and
Y, because the axiom of disjointness is closer to their common ancestry

(3) Estimate the unlikelihood of ICA, f(x, )2), as described in (6);

(4) Calculatﬁ k(x,y) =f(x,y) -(1C(M) —1C(Z));

(5) Calculate ICzistc, y) = ICS(x, y) — k(x, y).

With this procedure, the new shared IC is estimated as a weighted
average between IC(M) and IC(Z), where a higher f (lower potential
for ICA) leads to a shared IC closer to IC(Z) and lower f (higher poten-
tial for ICA) leads to a shared IC closer to IC(M). This means that the
shared IC decreases by a larger amount when there is a smaller potential
for ICAs. Note that if the two classes are not disjoint, k(x, y) = 0 and

ICES]. = ICS, which satisfy the open-world assumption.

3.2 Assessment

The assessment was done in the following three steps: (i) increase in cor-
relation coefﬁcient, (ii) effect of the number of disjointness axioms and
(iii) the effect of our measure in several random datasets.

3.2.1 Increase in correlation coeﬂicient First, we applied our new
measure of shared IC to a subset of ChEBI. Disjoint axioms were sup-
plied by the ChEBI development team (Hastings et al., 2012a, 2013), and
the main ontology was directly extracted from the ofﬁcial web page
(http://www.ebi.ac.uk/chebi/downloadsForward.do) on October 18,
2012 (corresponding to version 96 of the ontology).

To avoid any bias to an external corpus, IC for a class c was calculated
with an intrinsic measure based on the total number of direct and inferred
subclasses of c (Van Buggenhout and Ceusters, 2005):

_ 10g ID(c)I
log N N

 

 

IC(C) = — (7)
where D(c) is the set of subclasses of c (including c) and N is the total
number of classes in the ontology. For example, leaves of the ontology
(those classes without any descendants) have the maximum possible IC,
1.0. It is worth noting again that this is but one of the many possible ways
of measuring IC, and that our measure can be adapted to any of them.
We also used, for this assessment, the classical notion of shared IC pro-
posed by Resnik (1995):

Idmw=mmmmMm m

The subset of chemical classes from ChEBI used in this assessment
(see Supplementary Material A) was randomly selected by ﬁrst choosing

a pair of asserted disjoint classes in the ontology, A’ and B’, and then
choosing two classes A and B, respectively, descendants of A’ and B’,
both fulﬁlling two conditions:

0 Classes, not leaves: as many of ChEBI’s leaves represent fully speci-
ﬁed chemical compounds but we lack a trivial way to detect whether
they do so (see Section 2), we decided not to use the leaves in the
testing dataset.

0 Classes with sufﬁcient structural information: a class was included
in the dataset if either (i) it contains a Simpliﬁed Molecular-Input
Line-Entry System (SMILES) representation of its chemical
structure or (ii) at least 80% of its leaf descendants contain such a
representation. This allowed us to compare semantic similarity with a
purely structural measure, as explained later in the text. Only classes in
the chemical entity branch of ChEBI can fulﬁll this condition.

These selection criteria were applied until 40 distinct classes were
found. Therefore, the resulting set contained some pairs of classes that
are disjoint and some that are not. We chose to create a dataset bounded
by a number of classes rather than use all disjointness axioms at once
because it would be much larger and therefore analysis would take more
time.

To assess the usefulness of the disjointness axioms, we calculated the
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the outcome of ICES]. and a
purely structural measure of similarity between every pair of compounds
in the dataset created previously. Semantic similarity, in general, is not
intended to replace structural measures of similarity but to complement
them with a knowledge-oriented perspective. Thus, it may seem strange,
at ﬁrst, that we use the correlation between structural similarity and ICES].
as a way to validate our measure. However, ChEBI’s chemical entity
branch models chemistry knowledge largely based on the structural prop-
erties of the molecules. As such, it is to be expected that measures of
semantic similarity between classes from this branch of the ontology
reﬂect, to some extent, the structural similarity between them.
Therefore, in the particular case of this branch of ChEBI, semantic simi-
larity should also reﬂect structural similarity, and, as such, it is valid to
assume that an ontology-based measure with a higher correlation to
structural similarity is better at estimating similarity than a measure
with lower correlation to structural similarity.

To measure structural similarity, we used PubChem’s ﬁngerprint
method (Bolton et al., 2008). To compare classes x and y, we extracted
the SMILES representations associated with their leaf descendants, using
a best-match average approach to average over all the similarities, as
follows:

(1) For class x, choose the leaf descendant classes that contain
SMILES information, {x1, . . . , xn}. If x has SMILES information,
assume n = 1 and x1 = x. Do the same for y to achieve the set
{1’19 ---sJ’m}-

(2) Generate a PubChem ﬁngerprint for each x,- and y].

(3) Compare all the x,- ﬁngerprints with all the yj ﬁngerprints, with the
Tanimoto coefﬁcient (Flower, 1998), generating the matrix of
structural similarities s(x,-, yj).

(4) For each i, ﬁnd fx(i)=maxj{s(x,-,yj)}; and for each j, ﬁnd
fy(i) = maXi{S(Xisyj)}-

(5) Assign  to the structural similarity between x and y.

In summary, for the dataset created above, we compared all
compounds with all the other compounds (780 distinct pairs) using
three measures: structural similarity, classical ICs and ICiﬁs~. We pro-
ceeded by using Wolfe’s t—test (Rosner, 2010; Wolfe, 1976) to determine
the statistical signiﬁcance of the increase from the correlation coefﬁcient
between “structural similarity” and ICs to the correlation coefﬁcient

between “structural similarity” and ICiﬁsj.

Fig. 4. The process used to assess the effect of the number of axioms on
the correlation coefﬁcient between structural and semantic similarity. The
axioms are randomly partitioned into clusters pl—plo. Consecutively, each
of these clusters is joined with the previous ones to create a set
s, = U]; pj, which is then used to compute the increase in correlation
coefﬁcient

It is important to notice here that we do our analysis over the raw
value of ICiﬁsj, rather than any one measure of similarity based on this
value [such as in Equation (4)]. This was done to show that we can
increase the actual utility factor of the measure of shared IC rather
than the utility of a speciﬁc measure of similarity.

3.2.2 Eﬂect 0f the number of axioms The second assessment step
was aimed at measuring the effect of the number of disjointness axioms in
the increase of correlation. To this end, we created 10 sets of axioms
based on the full set of 199 axioms of disjointness to which we had
access. The ﬁrst set contained 20 random axioms, the second contained
these same 20 axioms plus 20 other random ones, etc, until the ﬁnal set,
which contained all the 199 axioms (see Fig. 4 for a graphical represen-
tation of this procedure). For each of these sets, we ran the ICES]. algo-
rithm and plotted a graph showing the increase in correlation versus the
number of axioms. To remove any bias that could have resulted from the
random method used to create these groups, we ran the same experiment
20 times.

3.2.3 Eﬂect on other datasets As the third assessment step, we stu-
died the increase in correlation coefﬁcient on other datasets, as the data-
set created for the ﬁrst step resulted from a random selection process.
Following the same selection process presented above, we created 550
more datasets (all with either 40 or 41 compounds) and compared the
correlation coefﬁcient as previously explained.

3.2.4 Implementation The semantic-related algorithms we used were
implemented by us in Java, based on the OWL—API (Horridge and
Bechhofer, 2011). Python was used to calculate Pearson correlation
coefﬁcients and to compute the P—values of the Wolfe’s t—test. We used
scipy (http://www.scipy.org/) package for this effect.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We present three main results stemming from the comparison of
structural and semantic similarity measures. Our main assump-
tion is, as stated above, that in the chemical entity branch of
ChEBI, a measure that correlates more strongly with structural
similarity is performing better at estimating the real similarity
than a measure with a lower correlation.

Disjointness in semantic similarity

 

4.1 Increase in correlation coefﬁcient

Our ﬁrst conclusion is that exploring the axioms of disjointness
leads to an increase in the correlation between structural and
semantic similarity.

The Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between the structural
measure and ICS is 0.69883, and after taking the disjointness
axioms into account, the correlation for structural similarity ver-
sus ICiﬁs- becomes 0.71571. This represents an increase of
0.01688. Despite the small absolute increase, this value is statis-
tically signiﬁcant, with a P—value of 4.5 x 10—8.

The small increase of the correlation can be attributed to at
least three factors:

0 As the annotation of disjointness is still incomplete in
ChEBI, we have access to only a small subset of all the
real disjointness axioms that could be expressed in ChEBI,
which means that the shared IC changes only for a fraction
of all the class pairs (39% from the sample selected). As
more axioms of this kind are included in ChEBI, we
expect both this fraction and the difference between correl-
ation coefﬁcients to increase.

0 Although highly correlated, structural similarity and seman-
tic similarity measures are inherently different, and as such,
there is a maximum bound on the actual correlation that can
be expected between the two. Also, different classes within
ChEBI can be expected to show a lower increase, whereas
others show a higher increase.

0 Disjointness is only one of the logical axiom types that are
used to express class deﬁnitions in an OWL ontology. In
fact, ChEBI contains a number of other properties that
are also used to capture the meaning of its classes, e.g. the
property has-tautomer, which connects together closely
structurally related chemicals, and has-role, which connects
a chemical class to its biological activity.

4.2 Effect of the number of axioms

To clarify the ﬁrst item above, we performed the second assess-
ment step, which aims to simulate the development of the ChEBI
ontology with respect to the number of disjointness axioms. For
each of the 20 runs, we studied the difference between the cor-
relation coefﬁcients as the number of disjointness axioms
increases, and plotted a graph with this information.

The graphs in Figure 5 show the result of some of these ex-
periments. These graphs illustrate that not all disjointness axioms
are important for a given dataset. In fact, only for some of the
sets of axioms is the correlation coefﬁcient signiﬁcantly affected,
which suggests that those sets contained the axioms that change
the logical meaning behind the classes in the dataset. The graphs
present a very obvious trend (see Fig. 6 for an average of the
graphs of all the 20 experiments) that indicates an increase of the
correlation, which, again, indicates that the disjointness axioms
improve the correctness of the measure of semantic similarity.

4.3 Effect on other datasets

As the dataset created for the purpose of the results presented
before resulted from a random selection process, we also studied

axioms on the correlation coefﬁcient between structural and semantic
similarity. In each graph, the abscissa is the number of axioms used by
the semantic similarity measure, and the ordinate is the correlation coef-
ﬁcient. The correlation coefﬁcient for 0 axioms is always equal to the
correlation measured with the classical ICS, which is 0.69883; the correl-
ation coefﬁcient for the maximum number of axioms corresponds to the
value 0.71571 presented in Section 4.1. These graphs are representative of

runs of Section 4.2. Although these values do not have any statistical
signiﬁcance in themselves, they clearly show the trend that the more
disjointness axioms are considered, the better is the correlation between
structural and semantic similarity

the effect of considering the axioms of disjointness in other 550
datasets. The graph of Figure 7 is a histogram that represents the
difference in the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient for all these
datasets. As is visible in that graph and in Table 1, the vast

We used Wolfe’s t—test to calculate the P—value associated with the
hypothesis that the increase was due to random chance, and marked
with a darker shade the amount of datasets for which P <0.05. The
vertical line shows the 0 of the axis, i.e. where the two correlation coef-
ﬁcients are the same

Note: The last column shows the frequency relative to all the 550 datasets created.

majority of the datasets are associated with an increase in the
correlation coefﬁcient. In fact, the effect of considering the dis-
jointness axioms for the semantic similarity only impacts nega-
tively 6.2% of the datasets. We observed a mean correlation
increase of 0.0149, with a standard deviation for that value of
0.0130. Furthermore, in 72.5% of the datasets, the increase in
correlation is signiﬁcant at a conﬁdence value of 0.05.

5 LIMITATIONS

Although the work presented here shows with statistical strength
the utility of IC:lisj when measuring shared IC between two
classes, it can still be improved. We presented the discontinuity
problem, and how to avoid it by restricting k so that shared IC
never reduces below IC(Z) (where Z is the most informative
ancestor of the MICA). This can lead to some other problems.
For example, future changes to the ontology can lead to unex-
pected changes in ICZiSj. Consider the ontology change of
Figure 8. Assuming 1000 classes in the ontology, IC(B) % 0.77
and IC(A) = 0. After the step illustrated in the ﬁgure,
IC(X) % 0.72. This means that ICziSJ-(EJ) increases unexpect-
edly from 0.38 to 0.74 because of a very small change in the
ontology. These kinds of top-level additions, however, are not
very common, and as such, the magnitude of this particular jump
in similarity is not expected to happen very often.

A second point of future development in our measure concerns
Equation (6), used to model the potential for ICAs. Our ap-
proach depends on the edge distance between two classes;

 

Fig. 8. A hypothetical developing step in one ontology. From one iter-
ation to the next, the ontology gained a new term between A and B.
Before this change, the similarity between E and F depends on the dif-
ference IC(B) — IC(A); after the change it depends on IC(B) — IC(X)

however, it may be possible to explore the semantics of the
edges themselves to reﬁne this measure.

Another important point to notice in this work is that the
measure of IC inﬂuences the results obtained with ICZiSj. In
this case, IC was calculated with the information contained in
the ontology alone. It would be informative to see the effect of
changing the IC measure used with IC:lisj to a more realistic one.

Finally, this assessment is valid in ChEBI because we may
assume that semantic similarity correlates with structural simi-
larity in the particular branch we used. For other ontologies,
where such assumption is not valid, the most promising way to
validate would be to rely on external and curated gold standards.

6 CONCLUSION

Recently, Couto and Pinto (2013) presented the beneﬁts that
result from using DL axioms in the calculation of similarity.
To the best of our knowledge, this article is the ﬁrst attempt to
include DL axioms into ontology-based similarity measures in
the biomedical domain.

Accordingly, the main purpose of this work was to test
whether exploiting the disjointness axioms of an ontology in-
creases the performance of shared IC measures. We developed
an add-on that can be used with any measure of shared IC, called
ICZisj, which satisﬁes the designated requirements set forth in the
beginning of the work, particularly that its value should decrease
for disjoint pairs of classes.

The assessment of our measure, which is based on the
Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between structural similarity
and semantic similarity, has shown that there is, in fact, an im-
provement of the measure of shared IC because its correlation
with structural similarity in an ontology that encodes structural
knowledge increases as the number of disjointness axioms
increase.

This new approach is able to successfully explore more than
just the subsumption hierarchy of an ontology, relying

Disjointness in semantic similarity

 

additionally on a partial subset of the description logic axioms
that are included in the ontology to further reﬁne the comparison
of two classes.

To the best of our knowledge, this represents the ﬁrst attempt
to use description logic expressivity in semantic similarity in the
biomedical domain. We demonstrated our hypothesis that dis-
jointness axioms contain informative data that can be correctly
explored by semantic similarity measures, even with a naive
approach. More sophisticated approaches may include the
exploration of the semantics of edges, other types of IC based
on external corpus, etc.

In conclusion, this work strongly suggests that future measures
of semantic similarity should consider the full logical formalism
of the ontologies that they use to establish a measure of similarity
that more accurately reﬂects the reality of the domain of know-
ledge therein modeled.

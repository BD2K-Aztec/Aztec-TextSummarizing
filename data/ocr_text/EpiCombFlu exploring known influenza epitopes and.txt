ABSTRACT

Motivation: Influenza is responsible for half a million deaths annually,
and vaccination is the best preventive measure against this pervasive
health problem. Influenza vaccines developed from surveillance data
of each season are strain-specific, and therefore, are unable to provide
protection against pandemic strains arising from antigenic shift and
drift. Seasonal epidemics and occasional pandemics of influenza have
created a need for a universal influenza vaccine (UIV). Researchers
have shown that a combination of conserved epitopes has the poten-
tial to be used as a UIV.

Result: In the present work, available data on strains, proteins, epi-
topes and their associated information were used to develop a Web
resource, ‘EpiComeIu’, which can explore different influenza epi-
topes and their combinations for conservation among different strains,
population coverage and immune response for vaccine design.
Fonivard selection algorithm was implemented in EpiComeIu to
select optimum combination of epitopes that may be expressed and
evaluated as potential UIV.

1 INTRODUCTION

The inﬂuenza costs half a million lives annually. Despite avail-
ability of vaccines, there is always a threat of pandemic from
newly emerging virulent strains. Current inﬂuenza vaccines, i.e.
trivalent inactivated vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine, provide
moderate protection, which is either greatly reduced or absent in
some seasons (Osterholm et al., 2012). Pandemics of ﬂu in the
past have indicated that these vaccines were not efficient against
new virulent strains.

The trivalent inactivated vaccine and live-attenuated vaccine
inﬂuenza vaccines provide protection by producing neutralizing
antibodies against surface structural glycoproteins, hemagglu—
tinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA) (Fiore et al., 2009). But
frequent mutations in these surface proteins result in escape of

many virulent strains from antibody-mediated immunity (F iore
et al., 2009). The ﬂu pandemic in 2009 and development of re-
sistance strains to ribavirin and oseltamivir drugs (Regoes and
Bonhoeffer, 2006) reignited the hunt for a universal inﬂuenza
vaccine (UIW, which can effectively counter the epidemic and
pandemics caused by the inﬂuenza virus.

In recent years, epitope-based vaccines have shown their ef-
fectiveness against HIV, hepatitis B and inﬂuenza viruses in clin-
ical studies (Atsmon et al., 2012; Engler et al., 2001; Gahery
et al., 2006). Current approaches have been focusing on B-cell
epitope (BCE)- and/or T-cell epitope (TCE)-mediated immune
responses to develop a UIV (Goodman et al., 2011; Kaur et al.,
2011). Single conserved ectodomain (epitope) of M2 (M2e) pro-
tein was developed as a UIV against the inﬂuenza virus, but
mutations in the middle part of the ectodomain eliminated its
potential as a UIV (Wang et al., 2009). A vaccine produced from
a single conserved TCE or BCE may not provide broad-speciﬁc
protection, but a vaccine developed from a cocktail of few con-
served epitopes can take it closer to a UIV (Atsmon et al., 2012).
Multimeric—OOl, a vaccine developed by BiondVax and contain-
ing a trimeric combination of nine epitopes from the inﬂuenza
virus, has provided broad protection and is currently in phase-II
clinical trials (Atsmon et al., 2012). Recent positive outcomes of
epitopes-based vaccines have provided an opportunity that avail-
able enormous information (epitope and protein sequences, im-
munogenic data, strains, etc.) on known epitopes (BCEs and
TCEs) in public databases may be explored for the selection of
epitopes and/or their combinations to design a potential UIV.
Therefore, a Web resource named as ‘EpiComelu’ has been
developed, which consists of the ‘Epitope information resource’
and the ‘Epitope combination explorer’. The former is a database
containing epitopes’ strain coverage and their immunogenic
data, whereas the latter explores combinations of epitopes for
maximum strains’ coverage using forward selection algorithm
(F SA).

retrieved from an inﬂuenza research database (http://www.ﬂudb.org/).
Redundant protein sequences within the same strain were discarded
while constricting protein sequences ﬁles for the aforementioned 12 pro-
teins. Different sequences of each individual protein (i.e. HA, NA, etc.)
and their associated information such as strain name, subtype, country
and host were stored. TCE and BCE ‘full data’ ﬁles were downloaded
from immune epitope database (http://www.immuneepitope.org/), and all
epitopes’ source organism (inﬂuenza), host organism (human) and ‘quali-
tative measurement’ related to immune response (positive, positive-low,
positive-intermediate or positive-high) from 11 inﬂuenza proteins were
extracted separately. Individual epitopes along with their literature refer-
ence, immune epitope database Id and information on types of immuno-
genic response and human leukocyte antigen (HLA) allele (in case of
TCE only) were stored in the MySQL database as backend data for
development of a Web resource. To avoid similar epitopes from the
same region of the protein, the epitopes were clustered, so that only
one epitope is selected from each cluster. CD-Hit (http://weizhong—lab.
ucsd.edu/cd—hit/) was used for clustering of similar epitopes with thresh-
old identity cutoff value of 80%. Total number of non-overlapping clus-
ters obtained in HA, NA, NP, M1, M2, PBl, PB2, PBl-F2, NSl, NS2
and PA proteins was 238, 72, 74, 33, 9, 48, 16, 4, 24, 10 and 20, respect-
ively. Clustering of epitopes helps in covering different regions of a
protein.

2.2 Calculation of epitopes’ strain coverage among
different strains and population coverage

All epitopes were matched against respective proteins to determine their
strain coverage. Exact sequence match was taken as conservation cutoff
because there is immense inter-residues interaction in T—cell epitope, so
even a single amino acid substitution can alter interaction of other resi-
dues to T—cell receptor or HLA molecules (Rimmelzwaan et al., 2004).
Data of all epitopes in terms of coverage in strains, vaccine strains, con-
tinent-wise strains, subtypes and their host organism were calculated by
using in-house programs. Individual strain coverage (ISC) of each epitope
was computed as the number of strains containing the epitope in their

respective protein sequences, and cumulative strain coverage (CSC) for
combination of epitopes was determined as the number of all strains
containing any epitope in their respective protein sequences. The strain
coverage percentage of each epitope was calculated as ISC number multi-
plied by 100 and divided by total number of strains where that protein
sequence was available. Similarly, coverage percentage of combination of
epitopes was calculated as CSC number multiplied by 100 and divided by
total number of strains where any protein sequence was known. This ISC
information was stored in the MySQL database.

Population coverage of TCE-based vaccine is crucial due to poly-
morphism of major histocompatibility complex molecules, which display
distinct peptide-binding speciﬁcity. The TCE that binds to several HLAs
or common HLA supertype provides maximum population coverage.
HLA supertypes of all TCEs [cytotoxic T-cell (CTL) and T-helper (Th)
cells] were also stored. Global representatives of the most frequent super-
type of HLA-A and HLA-B (A1, A2, A3, B24 and B7) were categorized
to provide population coverage information (Sidney et al., 2008).

2.3 Database: epitope information resource

Immunogenic information of epitopes and their coverage data were
stored in the MySQL database as backend data. The user interface
Web pages) was designed in hypertext markup language. PERL and
PHP languages were used in developing a server side program, which
retrieves information from the MySQL database for processing user’s
request. EpiComelu’s resource can be searched by protein’s name, con-
tinent’s name, host organism’s name and/or epitope’s type. The results
can be reﬁned and tabulated (downloadable in .xls format).

2.4 FSA for ﬁnding optimal combination of epitopes
(Epitope combination explorer)

The main component of EpiComelu is the Epitope combination ex-
plorer, which implements FSA to explore different combinations of epi-
topes for UIV. Evaluation of all combinations of epitopes covering
approximately all global strains of inﬂuenza can result in combinatorial
explosion. Therefore, FSA was developed and implemented in the Web
server to determine an optimal combination of epitopes covering almost
all global strains. FSA takes initial epitope with maximum strain cover-
age. To select the next one (epitope), it determines CSC for a combination
of new and initial epitopes, and the epitope (irrespective of protein) with
maximum strain coverage is included into the combination. Similar
method is followed to include the third epitope into the combination,
and the algorithm incorporates epitopes in an iterative manner till user-
mentioned numbers of epitopes are added in the combination. The FSA
can also take initial epitope(s) from user and then add new epitopes
(according to FSA) to provide optimal combination for maximum strain
coverage. The stepwise execution of FSA and its output is provided in the
Supplementary Figure (Fig. S1) and ‘Tutorial’.

3 RESULTS

Web resource ‘EpiComelu’ provides compiled information on
epitope’s strain coverage, epitope type, host type, literature ref-
erences, etc. so that user can evaluate the prospective epitope(s)
for developing a UIV. The Web resource also provides an ana-
lysis facility that adds epitopes automatically on the basis of
maximum strain coverage. The inclusion of information on
strain and population coverage and both humoral and cellular
immune response features in EpiComelu is crucial for epitope-
based broad-spectrum vaccine (Ben-Yedidia and Arnon, 2005).

3.1 Description

The Web resource provides a user-friendly interface to search
and retrieve information related to inﬂuenza epitopes in
‘Epitope information resource’. Output of the search is presented
in a tabular format, which contains strain coverage and immuno-
genic information of epitopes. ‘Epitope combination explorer’
explores different combinations of inﬂuenza epitopes using
F SA. There are two options to submit epitope sequences into
this module: (i) Selection of an epitope from dropdown menu of
corresponding proteins [mouse on epitope sequence in the ‘list
box’ displays a hover showing information about its immune
response, and coverage in strains (global, continents-wise
and vaccine, strains), subtypes and their host organism] and
(ii) insertion of epitope sequence is provided in the text box.
The epitope combination explorer provides similar information
as ‘Epitope information resource’ about conservation and
immune response, but for a combination of selected epitopes.

3.2 Conservation of epitopes according to strain, subtype
and host type

Epitope from HA, GLFGAIAGF I, has maximum strain cover-
age and is conserved in 27 402 strains. Top 10 epitopes from HA
protein have conservation range between 27402 and 13 761
strains. In the Web resource, strain coverage information of
each epitope is hovered so that user can select conserved epi-
topes. Strain coverage data of top 10 epitopes of each protein
is given in Supplementary Table S1.

3.3 Performance of the FSA for UIV design

When the epitope with maximum strain coverage,
GLFGAIAGF I, was used as an initial epitope for F SA and all
other epitopes were added automatically based on maximum
cumulative strain coverage of combined epitopes (Refer Section
2.4 and Supplementary Fig. S1), nine epitopes were selected from
ﬁve proteins (4 HA, 2 NA, 1 M1, 1 NP and 1 NS1) covering
51222 of total 57414 strains of inﬂuenza A virus (Table 1).
Epitopes 1, 3 and 7 provide CTL immune responses. Epitopes
binding to major histocompatibility complex II allele were taken
as Th-cell epitopes. Interestingly, other six epitopes are known to

induce Th immune response, which is crucial to encounter viral
infection (Tan et al., 2011). First and seventh CTL and second
and ﬁfth Th epitopes are known to bind with multiple HLA
supertypes, indicating their applicability to global human
population.

Epitope-based vaccine, Multimeric—OOl, is composed of nine
epitopes (four BCE and one Th epitope from HA protein, two
CTL and one Th from NP protein and one peptide that contains
both BCE and CTL epitope from M1 protein), and epitopes
forming this vaccine have coverage of only 30 848 strains of in-
ﬂuenza A virus (Supplementary Table S2) in comparison with
51 222 strains’ coverage for nine-epitope combination discovered
in the present work by FSA. Besides coverage, the FSA-dis-
covered combination of epitopes is expected to induce better
immune response and population coverage that is important in
vaccine design against inﬂuenza virus.

4 DISCUSSION

The EpiComelu resource has been developed to assist vaccinol-
ogists in producing epitope-based UIVs. Different combinations
of epitopes (potential UIVs with optimum strain coverage) can
be identiﬁed by using F SA with different initial epitope(s). The
combination of epitopes can be expressed as synthetic protein
and its UIV potential could be checked. As evolutionary con-
served epitopes are from functionally important parts of pro-
teins, these immunogenic parts are, therefore, expected to be
retained by new pandemic strains (McMurry et al., 2008). The
developed vaccine containing these epitopes is anticipated to pre-
vent or mitigate infection by pandemic strains. The performance
of EpiComelu server does not depend on initially selected epi-
topes. Many independent studies were carried out to verify
whether selection of different combinations of epitopes can
alter the strain coverage (Supplementary Table S2). In ﬁrst
case, instead of taking an epitope with maximum strain coverage
as the initial epitope, a 20-length epitope from HA was taken,
and F SA was used to ﬁnd out combination of epitopes with
optimal strain coverage. Similarly, in the second case, the same
20-length epitope was taken as the initial epitope, and only 210-
length epitopes were used subsequently for combination by F SA

(Supplementary Table S2). The F SA method was able to ﬁnd
combination of nine epitopes having ~90% strain coverage.
Even when four BCEs with low strain coverage were used as
starting epitopes, F SA was effective in getting epitope combin-
ations having >85 % strain coverage. This outcome of F SA jus-
tiﬁes that the strain coverage is not dependent on selection of
initial epitopes. Even if the user likes to include one or more
epitopes (i.e. known to be highly immunogenic) for developing
a UIV, the Web resource (F SA) can easily combine other data-
base epitopes to get maximum strain coverage (Supplementary
Table S2).

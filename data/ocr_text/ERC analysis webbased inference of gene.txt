Abstract

Summary: The recent explosion of comparative genomics data presents an unprecedented oppor—
tunity to construct gene networks via the evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) signature. ERC is used
to identify genes that experienced similar evolutionary histories, and thereby draws functional
associations between them. The ERC Analysis website allows researchers to exploit genome—wide
datasets to infer novel genes in any biological function and to explore deep evolutionary connec—
tions between distinct pathways and complexes. The website provides five analytical methods,
graphical output, statistical support and access to an increasing number of taxonomic groups.

1 Introduction

Genes carry out their functions in a complex network of interactions,
both physical and genetic. These interactions have effects on gene evo—
lution for multiple reasons. First, genes performing a common func-
tion will experience shared adaptive and conservative evolutionary
pressures, so that fluctuations in these pressures affect genes through—
out the network. Second, changes in one gene product can affect the
function of physically interacting gene products and thereby encour—
age compensatory changes. Both effects are hypothesized to cause
genes participating in a common function to experience evolutionary
rates that covary over time. This signature of co—functionality is quan-
tified by the evolutionary rate covariation (ERC) statistic.

ERC measures the gene—by—gene correlation of evolutionary rates
over a phylogeny of species, allowing the extraction of genes that
have experienced parallel evolutionary histories. Generally, ERC val-
ues are significantly elevated between genes that encode proteins in a
common complex, metabolic cascade or genetic pathway, and this ob—
servation extends across divergent taxonomic groups including pro-
karyotes, fungi, insects and mammals (Clark et 61]., 2013; Findlay
et 61]., 2014; Juan et 61]., 2008). In practical application, ERC can be
used to discover new functionalities via a sort of ‘guilt by association’.
Recently, ERC signatures were used to expand the gene network con—
trolling mating response in Drosopbila (Findlay et 61]., 2014). In this
study, ERC signatures between known pathway genes and an initial

pool of 664 candidates were used to identify six new genes in the
pathway. A similar study used ERC in yeast and Drosopbila to dis—
cern the functional roles of homologous recombination genes (Godin
et 61]., 2015). For human genes, ERC has been shown to efficiently
identify causal disease genes out of chromosomal regions or other
large sets of candidate genes (Priedigkeit et 61]., 2015). These success—
ful applications make a compelling case for public access to ERC
datasets so that geneticists and evolutionary biologists may similarly
infer functional relationships between genes.

We have generated genome—wide ERC datasets focused on three
taxonomic groups including humans and popular genetic models.
The size of these datasets prohibits casual browsing and analysis,
and requires custom computational tools and statistical tests in
order to be used effectively. The aim of the ERC Analysis website is
to allow users to quickly perform custom ERC—based inferences for
specific gene sets of interest.

2 Implementation of ERC analysis

2.1 Datasets: scope and generation

The website, written in PHP and Perl, provides rapid, custom analysis
of ERC datasets in three taxonomic groups—The mammalian dataset
employs 33 species, Drosop/oz'la 12 species and yeasts 18 species, and
these numbers will be augmented as more genomes become available.
Protein—coding gene models and annotations were centered on a focal

species for each taxonomic group. Mammals were based on human
‘UCSC genes’ as annotated at the UCSC Genome Browser;
Drosop/oila melanogaster annotations were as in FlyBase and yeast
genes as for Saccharomyces cerevisiae in Saccharomyces Genome
Datanase (Cherry et 61]., 2012; Dos Santos et 61]., 2015; Karolchik
et 61]., 2014). The website provides statistical analysis with rapid,
memory mapped retrieval of data and pre—computed permutation test
P—values fit to each application, dataset and sample size.

The underlying ERC datasets were calculated as previously
described (Clark et 61]., 2012; Findlay et 61]., 2014; Priedigkeit et 61].,
2015). Generally, each protein was compared with its orthologs
within its taxonomic group to estimate the rate of amino acid diver—
gence along each branch of its phylogenetic tree. Each protein has a
unique pattern of fast and slow branches relative to other proteins.
Using these characteristic patterns, we calculated each rate covari—
ation value (ERC) as the Pearson correlation of branch—specific rates
between a pair of proteins (Sato et 61]., 2005).

2.2 Analysis tools

Analytical tools were written to perform the tasks most commonly re—
quested by geneticists and molecular, cellular and evolutionary biolo—
gists. Broadly, these tasks (i) describe evolutionary correlations
between co—functional genes, (ii) discover new candidate genes for a
specific biological process and (iii) prioritize candidate genes for ex—
perimental validation (Fig. 1). Each of these analyses, detailed below,
provides an easy—to—interpret results page complete with statistical sup—
port. When possible, output is available as a hyperlinked table or tab—
delimited text to accommodate downstream computational analyses.

2.2.1 Group analysis

This tool allows the user to quickly measure the strength of the ERC
signature within a group of genes known or suspected to be func—
tionally related. This analysis is an important first step to assess the
underlying strength of ERC in a given function before proceeding to
subsequent analyses below. The results provide the pairwise matrix
of ERC values between all listed genes along with a permutation—
based P—value reﬂecting the elevation of the mean ERC within the
gene set compared with random sets of matched size. An additional
option can be chosen to cluster correlated genes within the matrix.

2.2.2 Multiple groups
The user submits multiple sets of genes, and the tool creates a matrix
of all pairwise ERC values for each, their mean and median, their

Fig. 1. The ERC Analysis website offers five functions and provides results
complete with tables and statistical analysis for each custom query

permutation P—value, and a Wilcoxon test to assess significant differ—
ences between groups.

2.2.3 Top genes

This popular analysis reveals the most correlated genes for a given
input gene. It provides the biologist with a list of candidate genes
enriched for functional association with the input gene. The tool
returns an ERC—ranked list of genes along with their empirical rank-
based P—value and a functional description of each gene.

Top genes will search either genome—wide or within a user—
defined set of query genes. The ability to search within a specific set
of query genes based on secondary criteria has proven highly benefi-
cial for ERC applications (Findlay et 61]., 2014).

2.2.4 Top functions

Similar to top genes, this tool takes an input gene and returns the set
of complexes or pathways associated with it via the ERC network.
This tool is useful to provide candidate functions for poorly charac—
terized genes.

2.2.5 Gene prioritization

When a biomedical study results in a list of candidate genes—from a
mapping or association study for example—it is often difficult to ex—
perimentally test all candidates. This tool prioritizes those candi—
dates for functional validation using ERC signatures with genes
known to affect the phenotype in question. The user submits a set of
training genes—from a particular disease or pathway for example—
and a set of candidates. The tool then provides a ranked list of those
candidates and statistics of their association with the training set.
This type of analysis was first demonstrated in the context of human
disease gene mapping (Priedigkeit et 61]., 2015).

3 Conclusion

The evolutionary history of a gene can be a powerful predictor of its
function and can rapidly provide novel candidates for genetics stud—
ies. The ERC Analysis website provides this information to all bio—
medical researchers in a simple interface. Furthermore, because the
power of ERC analysis generally improves with more species, the
website is continually updated with increasingly powerful datasets
gained by incorporation of newly sequenced genomes.

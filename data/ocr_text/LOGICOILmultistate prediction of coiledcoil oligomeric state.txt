ABSTRACT

Motivation: The coiled coil is a ubiquitous a-helical protein-structure
domain that directs and facilitates protein—protein interactions in a
wide variety of biological processes. At the protein-sequence level,
the coiled coil is readily recognized via a conspicuous heptad repeat
of hydrophobic and polar residues. However, structurally coiled coils
are more complicated, existing in a wide range of oligomer states and
topologies. As a consequence, predicting these various states from
sequence remains an unmet challenge.

Results: This work introduces LOGICOIL, the first algorithm to
address the problem of predicting multiple coiled-coil oligomeric
states from protein-sequence information alone. By covering >90%
of the known coiled-coil structures, LOGICOIL is a net improvement
compared with other existing methods, which achieve a predictive
coverage of ~31% of this population. This leap in predictive power
offers better opportunities for genome-scale analysis, and analyses of
coiled-coil containing protein assemblies.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coiled coils are protein-structure domains that comprise two
or more a-hehces that wrap around each other, typically in a
left-handed fashion, and which interact through speciﬁc packing
interactions known as knobs-into-hole packing (Crick, 1953;
Lupas and Gruber, 2005). Although accounting for ~2.9%
(range, 0.3—6.5%) of the protein-encoding regions of genes
(Rackham et al., 2010), coiled coils are also actively involved in
the mediation of protein—protein interactions across a wide array
of biological functions; from transcription, through membrane
remodelling, to cell and tissue structure and stability OK u, 2002).
Despite its functional diversity, the coiled coil is characterized by a
straightforward sequence motif of hydrophobic (H) and polar (P)
residues. The positions within this HPPHPPP motif, referred to as
the heptad repeat, are typically labelled a through g, with hydro-
phobic residues generally occupying the a and d positions, and
polar residues falling at the other positions. Given this common

sequence pattern, the 3D structures adopted by naturally occur-
ring coiled coils display a remarkable diversity (Fig. 1). Applying
SOCKET, an algorithm that ﬁnds knobs-into-holes packing
interactions within structurally resolved proteins Walshaw and
Woolfson, 2001b), to the Research Collaboratory for Structural
Bioinformatics Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) (Berman et al.,
2000) reveals an abundance of coiled-coil architectures and topol-
ogies (Testa et al., 2009). Indeed, coiled-coil assemblies have been
shown to contain different numbers of helices of parallel or
anti-parallel orientation, that may be formed from the same
(homo) or different (hetero) helical sequences (Lupas and
Gruber, 2005; Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009).

Here, we focus on the prediction of coiled-coil oligomeric state.
Six algorithms exist to tackle this problem: SCORER Woolfson
and Alber, 1995), which has been recently redeﬁned and retrained
in SCORER 2.0 (Armstrong et al., 2011), and PrOCoil
(Mahrenholz et al., 2011) achieve high success rates when separ-
ating coiled-coil sequences, but these methods are strictly limited
to the discrimination of parallel dimeric and parallel trimeric
coiled-coil structures. Multicoil2 (Trigg et al., 2011) and its pre-
decessor MultiCoil Wolf et al., 1997) follow a different approach
to predict both the location and oligomeric state of coiled coils in
protein sequences. However, their oligomeric state functions re-
main limited to the discrimination of parallel dimers and trimers.

Thus, these algorithms cover only a small subset of the
known coiled-coil structural space, limiting their usefulness.
For example, antiparallel dimers, so far excluded from all pre-
diction analysis, account for well >50% of the total coiled-coil
structure population and represent a wealth of untapped data
(Moutevelis and Woolfson, 2009). Current de novo methods
cover only ~31% of the coiled-coil population. Thus, simple
inclusion of antiparallel dimeric and tetrameric structures
would increase coverage to >90%.

Homology-based approaches, such as SPIRICOIL (Rackham
et al., 2010), partially accomplish the task of multi-state
coiled-coil oligomeric state prediction, but cannot be used to
classify the oligomeric state of coiled-coil sequences ab initio
that is, those without structurally deﬁned precedents. As a con-
sequence, we regard the development of an ab initio multi-state
predictor to be the next logical step in coiled-coil structure ana-
lysis and prediction. To the best of our knowledge, no work has
yet treated the ab initio problem of multi-state classiﬁcation of
coiled-coil oligomers. As previous attempts have focussed
on two-state predictions and, therefore, have been tailored
towards binary response problems, they could not be systemat-
ically extended for the purpose of multi-state classiﬁcation. As

coiled-coil topologies are observed in nature, the four oligomeric states
displayed here account for >90% of the known population

such, the problem required the development of statistical tech-
niques and algorithm capable of discriminating between multiple
coiled-coil oligomeric states.

2 APPROACH

LOGICOIL is based on the simultaneous use of Bayesian vari-
able selection and multinomial probit regression for prediction.
We favour this methodology over others for its ability to perform
variable selection and parameter estimation simultaneously.
Furthermore, the Bayesian paradigm allowed us to obtain
informative posterior distributions on the selected parameters
while providing a convenient framework for the use of previous
information based on biological data and expert knowledge.
Although other commonly used methods for classiﬁcation,
such as support vector machines, can incorporate variable selec-
tion in the context binary classiﬁcation problems (Becker et al.,
2009; Hochreiter and Obermayer, 2006), these methods are not
yet applicable to multi-class problems. The statistical framework
used for LOGICOIL can be easily applied to the prediction of
multiple coiled-coil oligomeric states, while accounting for the
inclusion of higher-order associations, such as intrahelical pair-
wise residue associations. Pairwise interaction effects have been
included in other algorithms that aim to predict coiled-coil oli-
gomeric state, but these are limited to two-state predictors and
are yet to be extended to multinomial classiﬁcation (Mahrenholz
et al., 2011; Wolf et al., 1997). The higher-dimensional models
and associated computational challenges that this approach usu-
ally may entail are becoming increasingly accessible; notably
through the use of Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) meth-
ods and increased computational power. After discussing multi-
nomial regression models in the Bayesian context, we describe a
Bayesian variable selection scheme that selects the most relevant
pairwise associations. Furthermore, we discuss computational
and implementation issues of the variable selection scheme and
how they were handled.

3 BAYESIAN MULTINOMIAL PROBIT
REGRESSION WITH VARIABLE SELECTION

3.1 Problem formulation

Assume a dataset {15; xil, . . . ,XipH-Ll, where n is the number of
observed samples, y,- e {1, ...,C} is a polytomous outcome

and xij is the observed value of the j-th predictor in the i-th
sample with j = 1,2, ..., p. We also denote the predictor
matrix X = (ye-j)” as:

predictor 1 predictor 2 predictor p
X11 X12 ' ' ' X11;
x 2 x21 x22 --- MP (1)
xnl xn2 ' ' ' xnp

The relationship between the probability Pr(y,- = chi) 2 Inc of
observing response c given X ,- can be conveniently modelled using
generalized linear models (McCullagh and Nelder, 1989), and it
is determined by a (1 x p) matrix of regression coefﬁcients ,Bc.
Although the unknown parameters in ,Bc can be estimated
through maximum likelihood techniques, data augmentation
techniques and Gibbs sampling can also be used to allow for
efﬁcient simulation under the Bayesian paradigm (Albert and
Chib, 1993; Holmes and Held, 2006). Here, we consider a
Bayesian auxiliary variable model that assumes the probabilities
me to be related to X ,- and ,Bc through a probit link function.

The key idea proposed by (Albert and Chib, 1993) is to
generate the y,- from the X ,- through latent vectors
Z,- = (2,91, ...,z,,C_1), which are thresholded to determine the
32,-; this means that probabilities me are deﬁned only implicitly.
The approach is expressed precisely through the following
notation:

C,  Zi’c = max{Z,-, 
y‘ C, if max{Z,-} 5 0,
Zi,c = I7i,c + 6i,c
ni,c = inBc
Giac N  
,Bc N 7T(,Bc)
where y,- is now conditional on the newly introduced auxiliary
variable vector Zi.

. . T T
Wr1t1ng 20 = [2190, ...,zmc] and so 2 [61,0, ...,enac] , the
auxiliary variable can be expressed in vector form as:

zc=Xﬁc+ec, ec~N(0,E)forc=1,...,C—1 (3)

(2)

where X is the (C — 1) X p predictor matrix, ,BC is the 1 x p matrix
of ﬁxed coefﬁcients with respect to the response c, 8,- is a
(C— 1) x 1 vector of errors, and E is a (C— 1) x (C— 1) positive
deﬁnite matrix with on = 1.

3.2 Bayesian variable selection

The Bayesian multinomial probit model in Equation (2) is
well-suited to variable selection problems. Throughout the past
decade, a number of special forms of the reversible jump sampler
introduced by (Green, 1995) have been advanced. In particular,
much work has focussed on data augmented models that pro-
pose efﬁcient predictor selection methods (Ai-Jun and Xin-Yuan,
2010; Gustafson and Lefebvre, 2008; Holmes and Held, 2006;
Stingo and Vanucci, 2010; Sha et al., 2004; Tuchler, 2008;
Zhou et al., 2004, 2006). Here, we use the scheme described in
(Holmes and Held, 2006) and (Gustafson and Lefebvre, 2008).

LOGICOIL

 

Their approach introduces a covariate indicator vector that
determines whether predictors are in or out of the model:

I _ 1, if ,6,- 75 0 (the j-th predictor is selected), (4)
y‘ _ 0, if ,6,- = 0 (the j-th predictor is not selected)

The parameter y is then included in Equation (3) so that:
zc=Xyﬁcay+ec, c=1,...,C—1 (5)

where X, are the elements of X set to 1, and ,BC,y consists of
all the non-zero elements of ,Bc. For the Bayesian variable
selection scheme in Equation (5), the remaining task involved
the estimation of the indicator vector y = {14, ...,yp} and the
corresponding ,6” and zc.

A Gibbs sampler is used to estimate all the parameters in the
model. Following from others, we choose a ‘ridge’ before
7t(,6) = Np(0, 1211,) on the (C — 1) x p matrix of parameters ,6,
where Np(,u, E) represents a p-multivariate normal distribution
with mean ,u and covariance matrix D and II, is the p x p identity
matrix (Brown et al., 2002; Sha et al., 2004). It should be noted
that alternative choices of previous distribution also exist (Liang
et al., 2008; O’Hara and Sillanpaaa, 2009). The detailed deriv-
ation of the posterior distributions of the parameters and the
Gibbs sampler used to estimate the parameter vectors 15,6”
and zc for Bayesian variable selection are identical to that of
Holmes and Held and Gustafson and Lefebvre (Gustafson and
Lefebvre, 2008; Holmes and Held, 2006).

3.3 Computing the response probabilities

For the development of LOGICOIL, we treated pairwise-
association selection and coiled-coil—oligomeric-state classiﬁca-
tion in two sequential steps. Pairwise associations were ﬁrst
selected using Bayesian variable selection. From the
{y(‘), 139,23), t = 1, ...,T} MCMC samples obtained from the
Gibbs sampling scheme, the pairwise associations with the
highest posterior probability of inclusion were assumed to play
the strongest role in predicting the target coiled-coil
oligomeric state. Posterior inclusion probabilities were computed
according to:

1 T
P04 = 1) = gs: Vii) (6)
z=1

Where

(I) _ 1, if y,- was included in the model at the t-th iteration
i _ 0, otherwise

Once the strongest pairwise associations had been identiﬁed,
the parameter values of the retained predictors were ﬁtted in a
separate model. Here, multinomial probit regression was chosen
to preserve consistency with the variable-selection process. There
is no closed form for the likelihood function of multinomial
probit models, but practical MCMC methods have been pro-
posed to compute parameter estimates. Here, parameter values
in the multinomial probit model were estimated using the MNL
library available in the R software (Imai and van Dyk, 2005a,b;
Team, 1993).

From the T samples {13929, t = 1, ...,T} of the secondary
MCMC scheme, the probability of a given test coiled-coil

sequence under each class was computed as:

T
pol- : chr) =  (choc/3&0) = maX{<I>(Xr/3,(-‘)), 0)})
-= 1, ...,C—1 d'
J Ian; J 79 c (7)
P04 = CIXi) = 72:1: (max{¢(Xi/31(-t))} S 0)

j=1,...,C—1

where <I>(.) is the multivariate normal distribution and X ,- is the
(C — 1) x p dimensional vector for observation 1'.

4 PRACTICAL IMPLEMENTATION
4.1 Convergence of MCMC sampling schemes

For all the examples discussed below, the convergence of the
MCMC sampling schemes was assessed using multiple chains
with different random number seeds and starting values. The
number of iterations necessary for the MCMC sampling
scheme to converge, otherwise known as the burn-in, was esti-
mated at the point for which the independent MCMC runs dis-
played similar values. Autocorrelation in the MCMC samples
was also checked to ensure that the chains were mixing
adequately. Once a suitable bum-in period had been identiﬁed,
a single long chain was ran and used to compute parameter
estimates and posterior probabilities. In line with accepted guide-
lines, it was also ensured that the acceptance ratio of the
Metropolis-Hastings (MH) step was kept in the range of (25—
45%) during simulations (Gelman et al., 2004).

4.2 Pro-selection of variables

Bayesian variable selection provided a rigorous framework to
select the strongest predictor variables in a model, but was com-
putationally intensive given the large number of variables in the
model. To facilitate simulations and reduce the dimensions of
our data, a pre-selection ﬁlter was used to choose a smaller
subset of variables, to which Bayesian variable selection was
subsequently applied.

Let n(a1 —> r1, a2 —> r2, c) be the number of times the follow-
ing is observed: amino acid al at register position r1 and amino
acid a2 at register position r2 and response c in the dataset; anti-
parallel dimer, parallel dimer, trimer or tetramer. Using the
hypergeometric distribution, the probability of observing the
spatial interaction n(a1 —> r1, a2 —> r2, 0) exactly k times can
be written as:

P(”l(a1 —> 11,612 —> 1‘2, C) = k)
_n(a1_>r19+_>r290)n(+_>r19a2_>r290) 
_ n(+, +,c)

 

where the symbol+denotes summing out over all other amino
acids and c e {1, ...,C}. A two-sided p-value was assigned to
each observation and used to pre-select the most signiﬁcant pair-
wise associations. To avoid missing important predictor vari-
ables, a relaxed pre-selection criterion was taken by setting a
P-value threshold of 0.1.

4.3 Previous distribution

The posterior inclusion probabilities p(y,- = 1|Y, X) have been
reported to be sensitive to the hyperparameter v in the previous
distribution 7t(,6) = Np(0, vIp) (Lamnisos et al., 2012, 2009;
Fernandez et al., 2001). To ensure we selected the variables
that helped achieve optimal out-of-sample predictive perfor-
mance, we followed the methodology adopted in (Lamnisos
et al., 2012) and used K-fold cross-validation across a range of
values on the hyperparameter prior v. The K—fold predictive
scores were estimated at [:20 values of v equally spaced in
the logarithmic scale with lower value 0.1 and upper value 500.
As this cross-validation methodology requires Kl MCMC runs to
estimate the K partition scores for the 1 values of v, we use a value
of K: 10 to contain computational expenses. Similar predictive
performance were obtained for values of v in the interval (0.1,
59), which is in accordance with the guideline range of v pro-
posed in Sha et al. (2004). For the chosen values of v, residue
pairs were pre-selected according to the method described in
Section 3.5 and subsequently applied to Bayesian variable selec-
tion model.

5 METHODS

5.1 Coiled-coil training and test sets

The sequences of antiparallel dimeric, and parallel dimeric, trimeric and
tetrameric canonical—that is, heptad based—coiled coils of >14 residues
in length were obtained from the CC + database (Testa et al., 2009). All
coiled-coil sequences were aligned using Clustalw2 (Larkin et al., 2007)
(maximum gap penalties were used to conserve the alignment of the
heptad repeat) and were then culled using Cluster Database at High
Identity with Tolerance (CD-HIT) (Li and Godzik, 2006) at a redun-
dancy cut-off of 50%. The corresponding structures were validated by
eye to ensure that all remaining sequences belonged to well-defmed
coiled-coil systems. We use a 50% identity threshold rather than 25—
30%, often used for culling protein datasets, as we ﬁnd the latter to be
too restrictive for coiled-coil sequences, which have a constricted amino
acid usage and, therefore, regarded as regions of low complexity
(Armstrong et al., 2011; Jones and Swindells, 2002). The ﬁnal dataset—
referred to as the pristine dataset—comprises 670 antiparallel dimeric,
173 parallel dimeric, 55 trimeric and 39 tetrameric coiled-coil sequences.

5.2 Assessing predictive performance

For problems involving binary response classes, a popular method to
quantify the prediction accuracy of a classiﬁer during cross-validation
is the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curve and the associated
area under the curve (AUC) measure (Fawcett, 2006). The overall per-
formance, denoted as mAUC, of a multi-class classiﬁer can be computed
using a generalization of the AUC for multiple class classiﬁcation prob-
lems as deﬁned in (Hand and Till, 2001). By averaging the AUC obtained
for each pair of classes, the mAUC discrimination rate can be obtained
through the score:

2

mAUC _ C(C—_1)  AUC,,,,, (9)
where AUCci,cj, (ci, Cj) e 1, . . . , C with (c,- 75 Cj) is the probability that a
randomly drawn member from response class i will have a lower esti-
mated probability of belonging to class j than a randomly drawn member
of class j. Although no equivalent to ROC curves exists to plot multi-class
performance measures, the pairwise AUCs can be visualized in the form
on a spider-web diagram. This has the advantage of showing the achieved

discrimination rate between all pairs of classes, therefore, allowing for
the identiﬁcation of pairs of classes that are well separated and those that
are not, regardless of the reported overall mAUC score. All AUC values
were computed using the ROCR and caTools packages in the R software
(Sing et al., 2005).

6 MULTI-STATE PREDICTION OF COILED-COIL
OLIGOMERIC STATE

6.1 Including pairwise associations in the model

Before running the Bayesian variable selection scheme on a
larger scale, we performed a trial run on a limited set of pairwise
associations. Because of its well documented and important role
in oligomer formation, we implemented Bayesian variable selec-
tion to detect the strongest residue d—a pairs, which is equivalent
to a i —> 1' +4 association (Fig. 2). The d and a register positions
are part of the coiled-coil hydrophobic core and have been
extensively studied; indeed, combining various pairs of residues
at the a and d positions of the heptad repeat induces speciﬁc
oligomer state switches (Harbury et al., 1993).

The posterior inclusion probabilities of pairwise associations
at the d—a pairs provided a noteworthy validation of the
Bayesian variable selection scheme that was used. Indeed, the
highest-scoring pairwise associations have been validated by
experimental studies that incorporated known rules for hydro-
phobic cores into a designed background. For example, [I (iso-
leucine at register d and a) is a well-established trimer-favouring
pairwise interaction, as well as the LL (leucine at register d
and a). LV (leucine at register d and valine at register a) associ-
ations is a dimer-favouring combination (Harbury et al., 1993),
whereas the IL (isoleucine at register d and leucine at register a)
pairwise interaction has been shown to confer tetrameric con-
formations (Harbury et al., 1993).

Because residues at the d—a register pairs are placed in the
hydrophobic core of coiled coils, it was expected that many pair-
wise associations would involve hydrophobic residues. However,
a few high-scoring pairwise associations with polar residues were
also found. Once again, these associations have been conﬁrmed
by experimental work that studied the effects of including a polar
side chain within the otherwise hydrophobic core of a coiled-coil
complex. For example, the LN (leucine at register d and

asparagine at register a) or LK (leucine at register d and lysine at
register a) pairs are found more often in dimeric sequences
(Gonzalez et al., 1996; Harbury et al., 1993). Furthermore, the
pairwise association NI (asparagine at register d and isoleucine
at register a) or IS (isoleucine at register d and serine at register a)
tends to favour trimeric structures (Akey et al., 2001; Hartmann
et al., 2009).

The Bayesian variable selection scheme also detected pairwise
associations, such as YT (tyrosine at register d and threonine at
register a), that had no precedent in experimental studies. Some
work has characterized the effects of placing the polar threonine
residue at the a register position, which produce trimers (Akey
et al., 2001). However, this work is in the context of a clearly
deﬁned design background (i.e. leucine and isoleucine in the
hydrophobic core positions) and does not consider the effects
of simultaneously placing a tyrosine residue at the a register pos-
ition. Placing tyrosine in the hydrophobic core may confer
higher-order oligomerization, as only these structures could ac-
commodate the large side chain of tyrosine without disrupting
the entire coiled-coil conformation Walshaw and Woolfson,
2003). This hypothesis is supported by the PDB 2GUV structure,
an engineered pentamer that incorporates bulky phenylalanine
residues in its hydrophobic core (Liu et al., 2006).

Overall, the posterior inclusion probabilities pairwise associ-
ations at the d—a pairs, and obtained from ﬁrst principles, agreed
with experimental studies. As the pairwise associations selected
through Bayesian variable selection were coherent with experi-
mental and structural interpretation, two main suggestions are
proposed: (i) they represented valid pairwise associations to
discriminate between coiled-coil oligomeric states and should
be included in the LOGICOIL predictive model and (ii) they
could be exploited to facilitate the rational design of coiled-coil
structures. Here, we focussed on the ﬁrst point and investigated
whether the inclusion of pairwise residue effects at neighbouring
positions of coiled-coil sequences improved the predictive power
of LOGICOIL. This was achieved by applying Bayesian variable
selection on the i —> i + 1, i —> i + 3 and i —> i + 4 positions of the
coiled-coil heptad repeat.

6.2 Performance of LOGICOIL

LOGICOIL was assessed using 10-fold cross validation on the
pristine dataset, and variable selection was performed internally
to the 10-fold cross validation scheme, that is, variables were
re-selected whenever the training set and test set were changed.
Before assessing the performance on a test fold, LOGICOIL
learned from the training fold according to a three-step process:

(1) Bayesian variable selection was run on each of the distinct
i—>i+1, i—>i+3 and i—>i+4 spatial positions in the
coiled-coil heptad repeat. For example, Bayesian variable
selection was run on the seven distinct i —> i+ 1 positions
a—b, b—c, c—d, d—e, e—f, f—g and g—a. The inclusion prob-
abilities of the pairwise associations were then computed
from the output obtained for each spatial position.

(2) The highest-scoring pairwise associations at all of the
i—> i+ 1, i—> i+ 3 and i—> i+4 positions were identiﬁed,
grouped together and ran through a secondary Bayesian
variable selection scheme. Inclusion probabilities were

Fig. 3. Boxplot of the mAUC achieved by LOGICOIL when response
probabilities were estimated using multinomial logistic regression. The
mAUC were obtained using 10-fold cross-validation on coiled-coil struc-

tures with sequences of >14 residues (light grey), 21 residues (dark grey)
and 28 residues (black) are shown

computed from the ﬁnal output, and only the highest scor-
ing pairwise associations were included in the LOGICOIL
predictive model.

(3) The parameter values of the retained predictors were ﬁtted
in a separate model, and the resulting MCMC samples
were used to estimate parameters and class probabilities
as in Section 3.3.

Generally, we observed that the selected pairwise associations
remained uniform throughout the separate folds. The conver-
gence behaviour of the secondary Bayesian variable selection
scheme and the pairwise associations that were selected to be
included in the LOGICOIL predictive model are listed in
Section 1 of the Supplementary Material. Figure 3 shows the
average mAUC values and associated variations obtained by
LOGICOIL during the 10-fold cross-validation scheme.

The inclusion of pairwise residue effects drastically improved
our ability to distinguish between coiled-coil sequences belonging
to different oligomeric states. In particular, the performance
obtained for coiled-coil sequences of >28 residues was high
(mAUC=0.93). As shown in Figure 4, pairwise AUCs of the
different pair of classes were checked to ensure that the good
overall performance was not a side product of a few well-
separated cases.

The separation rate for pairs involving tetramers was on aver-
age lower, in particular for coiled-coil sequences of <28 residues.
This could be attributed to the low numbers of tetramers in our
training set, meaning that more structural information may be
needed to improve predictions. Although AUC measures are
useful in estimating the discrimination accuracy of an algorithm,
they do not explicitly report the fraction of correct assignments,
that is, its accuracy. Therefore, we performed leave-one-out
cross-validation on the LOGICOIL pristine dataset. We report
the results as a confusion matrix obtained for coiled coils of >20
residues, shown in Table 1, which gives correct predictions on the
diagonal and incorrect predictions in the off-diagonal cells.

On this basis, LOGICOIL showed high classiﬁcation accura-
cies for predicting the oligomeric states of coiled-coil sequences
in the pristine dataset. We observe that the highest

misclassiﬁcations occurred between antiparallel and parallel
dimers, which might be expected given the similarities between
these structures Walshaw and Woolfson, 2001a). Nevertheless,
the increased predictive power of LOGICOIL suggested that
spatial associations contributed to differentiate between parallel
dimers, antiparallel dimers, trimers and tetramers. Interestingly,
the separation rate achieved for the antiparallel dimer/tetramer
pair was insensitive to changes in the coiled-coil sequence-length
cut-off, thus raising questions on the inherent nature of the struc-
tures involved. Contrary to tetrameric coiled-coil structures,
in-depth analysis of the antiparallel dimers structures in the
LOGICOIL dataset suggested that the vast amount of available
data for the antiparallel oligomer is in fact biased by many short,
buried (i.e. packed within a protein structure) coiled coils. It is
possible, therefore, that such structures are inﬂuenced into coiled
coil-like conformation by interactions involved in tertiary protein

structure. Hence, it could be argued that they are highly depend-
ent on packing interactions to adopt a coiled-coil structure and,
therefore, do not represent ‘real’—or free-standing—coiled coils.
Although it is possible that the performance of the LOGICOIL
algorithm could be optimized if structures that exhibit this prop-
erty were removed from its dataset, it was judged that this would
have been too subjective. Additionally, selectively removing data
from the training set could lead to unrepresentative database that
would not reﬂect the known population of coiled coils observed
in nature. In conclusion, although the caveats of the LOGICOIL
dataset should be highlighted and taken into consideration,
it is probably more prudent to strictly rely on the SOCKET-
annotated data and not tamper with any of the dataset.

6.3 Comparing LOGICOIL with other algorithms

LOGICOIL is the only reported method capable of discriminat-
ing between multiple coiled-coil oligomeric states, which compli-
cated the benchmarking of LOGICOIL against other existing
coiled-coil oligomer-state predictors. Indeed, MultiCoil,
Multicoil2, SCORER 2.0 and PrOCoil give predictions for par-
allel dimeric and parallel trimeric coiled coils only. Although it
was already shown that LOGICOIL achieved high predictive
accuracy, it was necessary to measure its performance relative
to these other algorithms. To do this, LOGICOIL was reduced
to a similar two-state predictor. The predictive powers of each
algorithm were compared on the non-redundant dataset of par-
allel dimeric and trimeric coiled-coil sequences developed for the
SCORER 2.0 algorithm (Armstrong et al., 2011). To ensure fair
comparison, LOGICOIL, SCORER 2.0 and PrOCoil were
retrained and assessed using 10-fold cross-validation to provide
independent tests of their utility. Because of the fact that
MultiCoil and Multicoil2 could not be re-trained and can only
score sequences of >21 residues, we only considered coiled coils
with sequence length above this threshold.

The AUC values and classiﬁcation accuracies displayed in
Table 2 show that LOGICOIL outperformed all other algo-
rithms in this two-state-prediction test, with PrOCoil coming
in a close second. Because of the unavailability of the
MultiCoil and Multicoil2 source code, it was not possible to
carry out cross-validation for these algorithms. As a conse-
quence, there is a possibility of overlap between the coiled-coil
sequences contained in the test database and the training set of
the concerned algorithms, thus biasing results. Nonetheless,

LOGICOIL

 

MultiCoil and Multicoil2 did not compare favourably with other
algorithms. The performance of MultiCoil was possibly linked to
its training set, which is heavily biased towards long parallel
two-stranded coiled coils (Gruber et al., 2006). This caveat was
resolved in the recently retrained and redesigned Multicoil2 pre-
dictor, which improved the performance of MultiCoil but was
not to the level of the other predictors.

PrOCoil nearly matched LOGICOIL on two-state prediction,
and it would be interesting to evaluate how this method performs
on multi-state classiﬁcation. SCORER 2.0 also achieved high
discrimination rate, but it was slightly surpassed by PrOCoil
and LOGICOIL. Interestingly, SCORER 2.0 is the only algo-
rithm to include no pairwise residue effects in its predictive
model, which serves as a reminder that including pairwise residue
effects does not necessarily increase predictive power. Thus, we
suggest that pairwise-association information may not be so rele-
vant in the context of two-state prediction, which is rationalized
by the well-characterized differences between parallel dimeric
and trimeric coiled coils, that is, there were enough distinctive
features between the two structures so that the added sensitivity
gained from spatial associations was not necessary. Rather, it is
the construction of reliable training sets and methods to detect
relevant pairwise associations that seem most important. For
example, LOGICOIL and PrOCoil select pairwise associations
with a scheme that favours sparsity. Also, their performance was
reported with variable selection performed through external
cross-validation, whereas there are no indication that the same
procedure was applied during the original assessment of
MultiCoil and Multicoil2. In addition, higher-order information
may well be important in coiled-coil discrimination (Hadley
et al., 2008; Steinkruger et al., 2010). We also assessed how
straightforward homology-based searches using the BLAST
algorithm performed on multi-state classiﬁcation of coiled-coil
oligomeric state prediction (see Section 2 in the supporting
information). Again, the predictive accuracy obtained by
LOGICOIL signiﬁcantly outperformed the BLAST predictions.

7 CONCLUSIONS

This work has introduced LOGICOIL, the ﬁrst algorithm to
address the problem of predicting multiple coiled-coil oligomeric
states from protein-sequence information alone. LOGICOIL in-
creases our predictive coverage of the known coiled-coil struc-
tures from 31 to >90%, but also distinctly improves our ability
to differentiate between coiled-coil sequences of different oligo-
meric state. By taking into account the independent contribution
of amino acids at different register positions, and subsequently
including pairwise association effects between distantly pos-
itioned residues, we show that LOGICOIL achieves a high
discrimination rate when predicting the oligomeric state of
coiled-coil sequences across a range of structures, including anti-
parallel dimers, parallel dimers, trimers and tetramers. As the
only algorithm allowing for such extensive coverage of the
total coiled-coil population, LOGICOIL could not be bench-
marked against any other algorithms. However, when con-
strained to the limitations of the currently available coiled-coil
oligomeric state predictors, SCORER 2.0, MultiCoil and
PrOCoil, it was demonstrated that LOGICOIL offers equal or
superior predictive power.

Although the improvements that the LOGICOIL algorithm
brings to the ﬁeld of coiled-coil oligomeric state prediction are
clear, we propose that LOGICOIL may still beneﬁt from further
iterations. Most notably, the LOGICOIL algorithm is currently
constrained to the sole function of predicting coiled-coil oligo-
meric state while depending on third-party softwares for the de-
tection of coiled-coil domains in protein sequence. We suggest
that extending the LOGICOIL predictive function to also in-
clude coiled-coil domain prediction would greatly beneﬁt users,
as this would result in a truly free-standing software capable of
simultaneously predicting coiled-coil regions in a protein
sequence along with its associated oligomeric state. Although
LOGICOIL in its present form is capable of dealing with
heptad breaks such as stutters, stammers and skips, it is not
explicitly designed to account for the potential effects that may
result from these sequence discontinuities. Given the increasing
number of newly detected non-canonical coiled-coil sequences,
future work will focus on the retrieval of heptad-break speciﬁc
information to augment the predictive power and coverage of
LOGICOIL. Despite these minor caveats, we suggest that the
development of LOGICOIL, and the unique features it offers,
widens the breadth of opportunities for biologists and bioinfor-
maticians alike.

LOGICOIL is publicly and freely available via the world-wide

LOGICOIL and can be used as stand-alone software for
known coiled-coil regions, or in conjunction with MARCOIL,
for coiled-coil region detection and oligomeric state assignment.

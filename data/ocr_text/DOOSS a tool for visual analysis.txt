ABSTRACT

Motivation: DOOSS (Data Overlaid On Secondary Structures) is a tool
for visualizing annotated secondary structures of large single-stranded
nucleotide sequences (such as full-length virus genomes). The pur-
pose of this tool is to assist investigators in evaluating the biological
relevance of secondary structures within particular sequences.
Availability and implementation: DOOSS is written in Java and is

1 INTRODUCTION

Large single-stranded nucleotide sequences, such as cellular
RNA molecules and single-stranded DNA and RNA virus gen-
omes, apparently form complex secondary structures through
Watson—Crick base-pairing between bases on the same DNA/
RNA strand. Identiﬁed using either computational folding
(Markham and Zuker, 2008) or experimental techniques
ONatts et al., 2009), only a few of these structures have any
known functional importance. Although techniques used to iden-
tify secondary structures typically give little or no information
regarding the biological signiﬁcance of identiﬁed structures, com-
parative structural and evolutionary analyses of related se-
quences can be illuminating in this regard (Hofacker et al.,
2002). Speciﬁcally, the evolutionary processes operating both
to conserve these structures and to maintain the coding potential
of the nucleic acid sequences from which they are composed,
could potentially be used to identify structures with likely biolo-
gical relevance (Tuplin et al., 2002).

DOOSS (Data Overlaid On Secondary Structures) permits
visualization of individual secondary structures simultaneously
annotated with large amounts of relevant data including, for
example, gene locations, codon usage statistics, computational
or biochemically determined nucleotide pairing probabilities, ap-
parently co-evolving nucleotide pairs and the degrees to which
individual nucleotides, codons or base pairings are evolutionarily
conserved. The intended purpose of such visualizations is ultim-
ately to assist researchers in focusing the attention of their
wet-lab and computational research onto the computationally

predicted or experimentally demonstrated nucleic acid secondary
structures that are most likely to have some unknown biological
relevance.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Secondary structure and data visualization

At its core DOOSS uses the VARNA package (Darty et al.,
2009) to generate geometric coordinates for plotting nucleotide
positions within structured nucleotide sequences, DOOSS then
displays these structures together with various user-speciﬁable
graphical data-overlays.

Secondary structures are displayed by DOOSS at two scales
with a full-scale view (Supplementary Fig. S1) of the whole se-
quence facilitating ease of navigation across the entire sequence
and a sub-structure view (Fig. 1) providing close-up details of
individual structures. DOOSS will then annotate these structures
with three different categories of data-overlay:

The ﬁrst category is a nucleotide composition overlay that can
be derived from sequence alignments, where the columns of the
alignment are used to determine nucleotide composition at each
nucleotide position within a structure. The nucleotide compos-
ition data are displayed in the form of a sequence logo at each
nucleotide position (depicted by a circle) of the structure.

The second category of data-overlay is for the visualization of
one-dimensional single nucleotide or single codon resolution
quantitative data such as degrees of evolutionary conservation
or biochemically determined base-pairing probabilities where
each nucleotide corresponds with a single numeric value. These
data values are visualized by way of a user-deﬁned colour
gradient.

The third category of data-overlay is for visualization of
two-dimensional quantitative data relating to pairs of nucleotides
such as the distance in angstroms between the nucleotides within
the predicted or experimentally determined tertiary structure, the
degree to which pairing between the nucleotides is conserved or
probabilities that the nucleotides are co-evolving (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). Wherever a pair of nucleotides in the
sequence has a corresponding numeric value within a certain
range it is depicted as a coloured line (also with a user-deﬁnable
colour gradient) between the nucleotides.

The resulting graphically intense representation of the second-
ary structures can then be saved as publication quality images in
various formats (PNG, SVG and EMF).

2.2 The dataset creation wizard

DOOSS provides a dataset creation wizard that steps the user
through the process of creating a dataset. The wizard requires the
user to specify a structure ﬁle (in any of various formats), a
reference alignment ﬁle (also in any of various formats but
which must contain sequences detectably homologous to that
in the structure ﬁle) and a set of mapping alignments and their
associated data ﬁles (in comma separated values format) contain-
ing data values to be visualized on the structure. Whereas the
reference alignment must contain one or more sequences, where
the columns of the alignment correspond precisely to nucleotide
positions within the structure, each of the mapping alignments
must contain the sequence datasets used to produce the nucleo-
tide- or codon-speciﬁc values in their associated data ﬁles. The
purpose of the mapping alignments is to allow matching up of
values corresponding to individual nucleotides/codons or nucleo-
tide pairs that were generated with diverse nucleotide sequence
alignments to the appropriate nucleotide positions in the struc-
ture. Speciﬁcally, the wizard uses the reference alignment corres-
ponding to the structure and the mapping alignments
corresponding to each data source to map data points within
each data source to the structure. The mapping of data sources
to the structure is done in an automated fashion via MUSCLE
(Edgar, 2004) generated pairwise alignments of reference and
mapping alignment sequences. To provide a visual representa-
tion of the data values corresponding to each data source, the
wizard asks the user to specify a ‘data legend’, which is a colour
gradient that speciﬁes a range of colours that represent the range
of numeric values contained within the data source; these colours
are then mapped to the corresponding visual elements on the
structure. Finally, the wizard can be used to specify annotations
that are displayed at the top of application, either by selecting a
Genbank ﬁle or by manually entering the coordinates of the
annotations.

2.3 Ranking of structures and sequence searching

To assist the investigator in identifying structures with potential
biological signiﬁcance, a ranking tool is provided that can be

used to rank individual structures using one- or two-dimensional
data sources. The ranking is done using a heuristic that compares
the distribution of data values within an individual structure
against the distribution of values in all other structures for a
particular data source. This allows the user to mine out what
are potentially the most biologically interesting structures
amongst those present.

A search tool allows the user to ﬁnd all structures containing a
speciﬁed motif. This is useful for ﬁnding a structure that has been
identiﬁed in the literature or elsewhere but might otherwise be
difﬁcult to ﬁnd in a dataset using only coordinate information.

2.4 The HIV-1 SHAPE dataset as an example

To demonstrate the ease of visualizing a sequence with hetero-
geneous data sources, we used the dataset creation wizard to
create a dataset from the HIV-1 SHAPE experimental data
(\Natts et al., 2009). Data sources generated in the original
study (the secondary structure itself, SHAPE reactivities and nu-
cleotide pairing probabilities) along with an additional data
source of our own (evidence of complementary co-evolution)
were used to create a dataset viewable in DOOSS (Fig. l).

The ranking tool was used to rank structures by the SHAPE
reactivities (a chemical proxy for accessibility) of nucleotides
within them. As expected, the Rev response element (RRE; a
well-characterized secondary structure in the HIV genome)
ranked ﬁrst (Supplementary Table S1). The ranking indicated
that the SHAPE reactivities of nucleotides within the RRE
were much lower than could be accounted for by chance given
the distribution of SHAPE reactivities for all other nucleotides
within the HIV-1 genome.

3 CONCLUSION

By providing a simple way to graphically view nucleic acid sec-
ondary structures in the context of sequence characteristics such
as degrees of evolutionary conservation or probabilities of nu-
cleotide co-evolution and a mechanism to rank structures,
DOOSS can assist tremendously in the identiﬁcation and char-
acterization of secondary structures that are likely to have bio-
logical signiﬁcance.

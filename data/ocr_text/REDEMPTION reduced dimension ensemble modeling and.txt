Abstract

Summary: Here, we present REDEMPTION (Reduced Dimension Ensemble Modeling and
Parameter estimation), a toolbox for parameter estimation and ensemble modeling of ordinary dif—
ferential equations (ODEs) using time—series data. For models with more reactions than measured
species, a common scenario in biological modeling, the parameter estimation is formulated as a
nested optimization problem based on incremental parameter estimation strategy. REDEMPTION
also includes a tool for the identification of an ensemble of parameter combinations that provide
satisfactory goodness—of—fit to the data. The functionalities of REDEMPTION are accessible through
a MATLAB user interface (Ul), as well as through programming script. For computational speed—
up, REDEMPTION provides a numerical parallelization option using MATLAB Parallel Computing
toolbox.

1 Introduction

Mathematical modeling plays an increasingly important role in
understanding and predicting biological phenomena. In this regard,
ordinary differential equation (ODE) models are often created to de—
scribe the dynamic behavior of biological systems based on mass or
molar conservation, as follow:

dX(t)
dt

 

= 5V(X(t)ap); X(0) = X0, (1)

where t denotes time, X(t) is the species concentration vector, S is
the stoichiometric or connectivity matrix, V(X(t), p) is the reaction
rate or flux equation vector, p denotes the kinetic parameter vector
and X0 denotes the initial concentration vector. The estimation of
unknown kinetic parameters from time—series data is the most chal—
lenging step in the creation of such biological models, due to: (i)
high computational cost associated with global optimizations and
with integrating ODEs (Chou and Voit, 2009), and (ii) the lack of
parameter identifiability (Srinath and Gunawan, 2010).

The high computational complexity could be addressed by per—
forming the parameter estimation incrementally. Here, time—series
data are first smoothened and differentiated, and subsequently the
dynamic ﬂux values are computed by viewing Equation (1) as an
algebraic equation. The parameters are estimated one flux at a
time while avoiding ODE integrations (Voit and Almeida, 2004).
However, such an approach requires that S has a full column
rank, which is often not satisfied in the modeling of biological
systems.

We recently developed incremental parameter estimation (IPE)
and integrated ﬂux parameter estimation (IFPE) to address the limi-
tation related to the matrix S. In IPE (IFPE), we formulated the par-
ameter estimation as a nested optimization, where the outer
optimization was performed over a subset of parameters corres—
ponding to the independent (integrated) ﬂuxes, defined such that
given their values, the remaining (integrated) fluxes could be esti—
mated from the slope of time—series data (Jia et 61]., 2012a; Liu and
Gunawan, 2014). The inner optimizations involved estimating

parameters associated with the dependent flux subset using their
estimated (integrated) ﬂux values, performed one ﬂux at a time.

Meanwhile, incomplete parameter identifiability implies that
many parameter combinations could fit the data equally well (Jia
et al., 2012b). In ensemble modeling, instead of generating one best—
fit parameter estimate, one looks for a set of parameter combin—
ations which fit the data within an acceptable prediction accuracy,
e.g. an upper bound for the error function. We extended our incre—
mental estimation strategy above such that the identification of par—
ameter ensemble could be efficiently performed over smaller
parameter dimensions (Jia et al., 2012b).

Reduced Dimension Ensemble Modeling and Parameter estima—
tion (REDEMPTION) provides a UI for efficient parameter estima—
tion and ensemble modeling based on IPE and IFPE in MATLAB.
The functions within REDEMPTION were designed to address a
common scenario in biological modeling, where the number of reac—
tions exceeds that of the (measured) species. When this scenario
does not apply, REDEMPTION automatically reverts to a standard
IPE. For ensemble modeling, REDEMPTION employs an efficient
parameter exploration algorithm HYPERSPACE, which combines
an Adaptive Monte Carlo method and a multiple ellipsoids based
sampling (Zamora—Sillero et al., 2011).

2 Main features

Model and data speciﬁcations: REDEMPTION’s UI starts with the
Main window (Fig. 1a), from which users can access all functional—
ities. The ODE model equations can be specified manually through
the Model Editor using power—law or linear-logarithmic (lin-log)
kinetics (Fig. 1c), or by importing an SBML file. In addition,
REDEMPTION requires upper and lower bound values for the
model parameters. A parameter will be estimated from data when
the upper and lower bounds differ. Users also need to provide the
time—series concentration data in Comma—Separated Values (CSV)
format. For data pre—processing, REDEMPTION includes piecewise
polynomial spline-fitting, where users can adjust the number of
pieces and the order of polynomials (Fig 1d).

Parameter estimation: Figure 1e depicts REDEMPTION’s par-
ameter estimation UI. For parameter estimation, REDEMPTION
provides four variants of the IPE and IFPE methods and two error
functions using sum of squares of the absolute or relative model

prediction errors (User Guide for more details). Here, users can se—
lect MATLAB’s Genetic Algorithm (GA) or enhanced Scatter Search
(eSS) (Egea et al., 2010) as the global optimization algorithm.

Ensemble modeling: After a successful run of parameter estima—
tion, users can generate parameter ensemble corresponding to par-
ameter combinations whose error function values are smaller than a
user—specified threshold (Fig. 1f). The optimal error function value
obtained from the prior parameter estimation step is provided as a
reference for setting this threshold. The appropriate threshold could
for example be calculated by bootstrapping the original data (Jia
et al., 2012b). Figure 1f shows a 2D parameter projection of the gen—
erated parameter ensemble, in which each blue dot represents a par—
ameter combination in the ensemble and the largest dot corresponds
to the optimal solution of the parameter estimation step. To include
an additional dataset, users can perform parameter estimation and
ensemble modeling again using the additional data and new param—
eter bounds based on the parameter ensemble (User Guide for more
information).

3 Examples

Figure 1 illustrates the workﬂow of REDEMPTION for parameter
estimation and ensemble generation using a branched pathway ex—
ample as shown in Figure 1b (Voit and Almeida, 2004).
REDEMPTION also includes the lin—log modeling of Lactococcus
lactis glycolytic pathway as another example (del Rosario et al.,
2008). Details of these examples can be found in the User Guide.

4 Conclusions

REDEMPTION provides an integrated, numerically efficient tool
for estimating kinetic parameters and parameter ensemble of ODE
models. The tools within REDEMPTION are accessible through a
user-friendly MATLAB UI and applicable for ODE models with
power—law or lin—log kinetics, and those in SBML format.

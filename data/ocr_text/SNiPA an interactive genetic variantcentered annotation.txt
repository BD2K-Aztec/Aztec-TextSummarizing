Abstract

Motivation: Linking genes and functional information to genetic variants identified by association
studies remains difficult. Resources containing extensive genomic annotations are available but
often not fully utilized due to heterogeneous data formats. To enhance their accessibility, we inte—

 

grated many annotation datasets into a user—friendly webserver.

1 Introduction

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) and next—generation
sequencing (NGS) are performed routinely to identify genetic vari-
ants and novel genes implicated in both common and rare human
diseases. A key step in translating results from such studies into a
better understanding of molecular disease mechanisms and, ultim-
ately, into clinical applications, is the prioritization of potentially
functional variants that may be active in vivo. To this end, compre—
hensive collection and evaluation of existing functional annotation
from genetic, informatics and experimental resources is essential
(MacArthur et 61]., 2014). This comprises the integration of data and
knowledge across multiple levels including the variant, the gene and
the chromatin level.

Several large resources (Ensembl, UCSC, NCBI, etc.) aim at pro—
viding genome—wide genome—level annotation tracks from an exten—
sive set of resources. However, retrieving statistical and functional
annotation relevant at the single nucleotide level remains difficult.
For instance, common genome browsers often display single nucleo—
tide variants (SNVs) as thin bars that trail away in the wealth
of other annotation tracks and are even less prepared to display
statistics such as linkage disequilibrium (LD) relationships

between variants. This limits visual distinction of relevant variants
from those without relevant annotations and leaves the complex
task of aggregating position—based data to the researcher. Variant—
centered resources, on the other hand, typically concentrate on
specific types of data such as amino acid changes (Adzhubei et 61].,
2010; Kumar et 61]., 2009), expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs) (GTEx Consortium, 2013; Xia et 61]., 2012), trait associ—
ations (Beck et 61]., 2014; Hindorff et 61]., 2009) or regulatory effect
predictions (Boyle et 61]., 2012). Moreover, these annotations are
often presented in resource—specific data structures.

For individual inspection of single variants, both resource
types are extremely valuable. However, for simultaneous processing
of larger variant sets, collection and examination of annotations
from different data sources quickly becomes cumbersome. This
presents a major bottleneck in genome—wide scans of genetic
inﬂuences on human traits since the collection of such evidences is
the key to understanding the effects of phenotype—linked genetic
variants.

Here we propose SN iPA, a web service offering variant—centered
genome browsing and interactive visualization tools tailored for
easy inspection of many variants in their locus context (Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. The SNiPA Variant Browser shows variants (top), genes (center) and
regulatory regions (bottom). Top-level information is available in mouse-over
tooltips for all plot elements as shown here for the query SNP rs174583. The
example highlights the value of variant-centered accumulation of annota-
tions: rs174583 is associated with the concentration of a lipid metabolite as
well as with the expression levels of two genes encoding enzymes involved
in lipid metabolism (FADS1/2) and the gene coding for LDL receptor, a major
regulator of cholesterol homeostasis. Furthermore, the variant was linked to
the response to lipid lowering drugs (statins), which target HMG-CoA reduc-
tase regulated by the LDL receptor

2 Data and features

SNiPA includes a wide range of genome—level datasets contained in
the Ensembl database (Flicek et 61]., 2014) as an established back—
bone of annotations for the human genome. We combine this back—
bone with numerous variant—specific annotations taken from
published datasets. Thus, SNiPA covers information ranging from
regulatory elements, over gene annotations to variant annotations
and associations (Table 1; Supplementary Text S1). SNiPA contains
annotations for all bi—allelic variants in phase 3 version 5 of the
1000 genomes project (1000 Genomes Project Consortium et 61].,
2012) and provides pre—calculated LD—data for r2 2 0.1 for all super
populations (African, American, South and East Asian, European).
We use the Ensembl VEP tool (McLaren et 61]., 2010) for primary ef-
fect prediction of SNVs. Additional position—based data is included
in the VEP prediction as custom annotation files. For other annota—
tions, we wrote a Perl module to extend the output provided by VEP
(Table 1; Supplementary Text S1).

SNiPA provides user—friendly starting points for annotating
individual SNVs as well as sets of SNVs, LD blocks or genetic
regions of interest. We have implemented several entry points
to access the data: (i) a variant—centered implementation of a
genome browser (‘Variant Browser’); (ii) ‘Association Maps’ for
browsing through GWAS results; (iii) an interface for batch
retrieval of variant annotations via ID—list, gene ID or genomic
coordinates (‘Variant Annotation’); (iv) a combined listing of an-
notations across a set of variants within LD blocks or chromo-
somal regions (‘Block Annotation’); (v) ‘Regional Association

Browser’; (vi) ‘Proxy Search’ and ‘Pairwise LD’ that allow query—
ing precalculated LD values augmented with variant annotations.
SNiPA enables the user to download condensed annotation data
in tabular format for further off—line processing. Detailed descrip—
tions of SNiPA modules are available in the online documenta—
tion and Supplementary Text S1.

The complex information contained in SNiPA is organized in a
clear, comprehensive and informative structure extending effect cat—
egories contained in the Sequence Ontology (Eilbeck et 61]., 2005)
(Supplementary Text S1). For instance, variant annotations are pre—
sented as ‘SN iPAcards’ grouping information into semantic sections.
All annotations are linked to their primary sources and to the
Ensembl genome browser.

3 Conclusion

Mechanistic characterization of variants identified by genetic studies
is the key to understanding molecular disease mechanisms. SNiPA
combines a comprehensive set of genomic annotations with a genetic
variant—based genome browser to simplify the task of variant anno-
tation. SNiPA as well as all underlying data is freely available to the
scientific community (commercial use may be limited by third—party
constraints) and will be automatically updated following the
Ensembl releases.

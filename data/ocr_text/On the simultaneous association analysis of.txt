ABSTRACT

Motivation: For samples of unrelated individuals, we propose a
general analysis framework in which hundred thousands of genetic
loci can be tested simultaneously for association with complex pheno-
types. The approach is built on spatial-clustering methodology,
assuming that genetic loci that are associated with the target
phenotype cluster in certain genomic regions. In contrast to standard
methodology for multilocus analysis, which has focused on the
dimension reduction of the data, our multilocus association-clustering
test profits from the availability of large numbers of genetic loci by
detecting clusters of loci that are associated with the phenotype.
Results: The approach is computationally fast and powerful, enabling
the simultaneous association testing of large genomic regions. Even
the entire genome or certain chromosomes can be tested simultan-
eously. Using simulation studies, the properties of the approach
are evaluated. In an application to a genome-wide association study
for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, we illustrate the practical
relevance of the proposed method by simultaneously testing all
genotyped loci of the genome-wide association study and by testing
each chromosome individually. Our findings suggest that statistical
methodology that incorporates spatial-clustering information will be
especially useful in whole-genome sequencing studies in which
millions or billions of base pairs are recorded and grouped by genomic
regions or genes, and are tested jointly for association.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the search for disease susceptibility loci (DSLs), genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) have been a successful instrument
for the identification of replicable genetic associations (Hardy
and Singleton, 2009; Manolio et al., 2008). For most complex

diseases and phenotypes, they discovered numerous genetic
associations that can be validated in independent populations,
although the genetic effect sizes of the loci are relatively small.
Despite the large number of detected loci, GWAS association
signals are only able to explain a small fraction of the overall
predicted heritability (Visscher et al., 2008), i.e. the phenomenon
of “missing heritability’. One possible explanation for this phe-
nomenon is “synthetic associations’(Dickson et al., 2010).
Simulation studies, theoretical considerations and empirical evi-
dence (Adzhubei et al., 2010; Cohen et al., 2006; Fearnhead
et al., 2004; Kryukov et al., 2007; Nejentsev et al., 2009;
Pritchard and Cox, 2002) suggest that genetic associations, as
they are detected by GWAS, can be caused by multiple rare
variants (RVs). Because common variants are poor proxies for
RVs or are not in linkage disequilibrium (LD) with rare disease-
causing variants, it may be difﬁcult to identify or characterize
rare DSLs in GWAS data.

Another plausible explanation for the phenomenon of “missing
heritability’ is insufﬁcient statistical power due to the multiple-
testing problem. In a GWAS, millions of genetic loci are tested
individually for association with the target phenotype, and the
test results have to be adjusted for multiple comparisons, leading
to extremely small P-value thresholds for overall statistical sig-
niﬁcance. The standard approach has been aimed to increase the
sample size of GWAS as much as possible. For example, several
meta-analyses of GWASS (Allen et al., 2010) have contained the
data of >100 000 study subjects. However, such large sample
sizes hold the danger of increased study heterogeneity and do
not necessarily lead to increased statistical power.

The fundamental issue with the standard analysis approach to
GWAS (single locus association testing and adjustment for mul-
tiple comparisons) is that an increase in genomic resolution, i.e.
adding more and more genetic loci to the analysis, does not in-
crease the probability to detect DSLs, but diminishes the statistical
power of the approach. To address this issue, multilocus tests have
been suggested. For example, gene-based analysis has been advo-
cated (Neale and Sham, 2004) to complement allelic association
analysis of single locus. This is motivated by the idea that causal
variants for one disease tend to reside in proximity to each other
and variants in adjacent regulatory regions are more likely to have
functional relevance (Huang et al., 2011). PLINK (Purcell et al.,

2007) provides “set-based’ tests using the average single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) statistic across the set of SNPs to implement
this idea. Moreover, other tests such as the minSNP test, the
Bayesian imputation-based association mapping (BIMBAM)
test (Servin and Stephens, 2007), the versatile gene-based test
(VEGAS) test (Liu et al., 2010) and the LASSO regression
method for GWAS (Wu et al., 2009) have been proposed. Later
on, Huang et a]. (2011) proposed a gene-wide signiﬁcance (GWiS)
test, which estimates the number of independent effects within a
gene. For next-generation sequencing data, methods that aggre-
gate over a set of RVs to search for associated genomic regions
with the disease status are shown to be more powerful than single
locus approaches, e.g. the cohort allelic sums test (CAST)
(Morgenthaler and Thilly, 2007), the combined multivariate and
collapsing (CMC) method (Li and Leal, 2008), the weighted sum
statistic by Madsen and Browning (Madsen and Browning, 2009),
the kernel-based adaptive-clustering (KBAC) test (Liu and Leal,
2010), the sequence kernel association test (SKAT) (Wu et al.,
2011), replication-based test (RBT) (Ionita-Laza et al., 2011)
and so forth. There are several advantages of such gene-based
tests over single loci tests. First, collapsing the small effects
across the variants within a gene could give larger effect size to
detect the association. Second, due to the smaller number of genes
to be tested, the multiple-testing problem is reduced. Moreover,
the associations of genes across different populations can be dir-
ectly compared even though there could be different LD patterns
within the genes across the populations (Huang et al., 2011).

However, most of the approaches can handle only a limited
number of genetic loci, i.e. typically <100. None of them is able
to incorporate the information about the physical location of the
loci and their clustering. In this article, we are proposing a novel
approach called the Bin test that can test a large genomic region
for association with the target phenotype by taking into account
the physical location of the variants that show evidence for as-
sociation and their physical clustering. The genomic region can
refer to one gene, a speciﬁed segment of the genome, a pathway,
an entire chromosome or the complete genome. The approach is
computationally fast and applicable to binary and complex
phenotypes. The methodology is evaluated in simulation studies
using a GWAS dataset from the COPDGene study and is
applied to several collaborating chronic obstructive pulmonary
disease (COPD) genetic studies. The simulation studies and the
application results suggest that the approach has sufﬁcient power
to test simultaneously all genotyped loci on the entire genome or
a speciﬁc chromosome.

2 METHODS

The proposed test assesses whether there is signiﬁcant clustering of causal
variants within a speciﬁed region. We consider both the level of associ-
ations between the variants and the trait, and the location of the variants.
The degree of association between a variant and the phenotype is repre-
sented by the association P-values, which is easy to obtain from any
dataset and allows the application of our method to both quantitative
traits and dichotomous traits. To put this into a one-dimensional cluster-
ing problem, we need to consider four aspects of the test:

(1) What distance measure to use: the physical distance between two
variants or a newly deﬁned distance measure.

(2) Which single nucleotide variants (SNVs) to look at: a P-value
cutoff to select the variants. Note that we use SNV to refer to all
the variants, including variants with allele frequency <1%, and
use SNP to refer to variants with allele frequency > 1%.

(3) Whether to look at the distance to the nearest neighbor or the
distances to the neighboring variants, and how many neighboring
variants should be considered in the calculation of distances.

(4) How to quantify the difference between the distribution of the
observed distances and the distribution of distances under the
null, i.e. what test to use.

2.1 Distance measure

The ﬁrst three aforementioned questions refer to the choice of distance
distribution. Considering the absolute size of the physical distances be-
tween the variants and the P-values obtained from the association tests,
our goal is to have a distance measure such that the distance between two
variants is small if the “average’ P-value of the two variants is small, and if
the physical distance between the two variants is small, relative to the
other variants. Thus, we consider the multiplication of the physical dis-
tance with the association information rather than the addition of the two
values to avoid the situation where the “average P-value’ is overwhelmed
by the physical distance. To obtain the “average’ degree of association of
the two variants, multiplication of the two P-values is also more suitable
than addition, as one large P-value would dominate a much smaller
P-value. We deﬁne a new distance measure D between two variants that
combines the P-value with the physical distance between the variants:

DU" 2 diSl‘lU >I< V 515]"
where the subscript i and j refer to any two variants in the region of
interest. The distance measure is motivated by the fact that this distance
equals the area below the geometric average of the P-values of the two
variants. We use the square root here to have the absolute value of DU- to
lie in a reasonable range.

2.2 Cutoff values

There are two parameters that can be varied in the test: a cutoff value
for the P-values—P, such that only variants with P-values below P are
considered in the test of clustering; and the number of neighboring vari-
ants around each variant for calculating the distances—R. We could use a
P-value of 1 to include all the variants and consider the distances from
one variant to all the other variants in the region, but simulations suggest
that this is computationally costly and has relatively low power compar-
ing with including only variants with P-values below a threshold. Thus,
a threshold on the P-value for selecting variants is used. The nearest-
neighbor method is commonly used in clustering analysis, and it requires
less computational cost. However, it does not give much information
on the second, third or higher-level neighbors. Thus we consider both
the distance to the nearest neighbor and the distances to a predeﬁned
R number of neighboring variants in the region.

In our analysis, this threshold of neighboring variants R and the cutoff
value of P-values P are set to be the values that correspond to speciﬁed
quantiles of all the variants in the region of interest. For example, we may
specify the cutoff quantile for the P-values to be 0.1%, which means the top
0.1% variants with the smallest P-values are included in the analysis. If we
specify the quantile threshold of neighboring variants R to be 1%, it means
that the number of neighboring variants used to calculate the distances
from each variant is 1% times N, where N is the total number of variants.

2.3 Test on the distance distribution

To test whether there is clustering of small P-values, the distribution
of the distances between the variants needs to be compared with the

distribution of the distances under the null hypothesis in some way.
The most popular non-parametric method to compare the empirical dis-
tribution of one sample with a speciﬁed distribution, or to compare the
empirical distributions of two samples, is the Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS)
statistic, deﬁned as follows:

Dn1,n2 = Sup |F1,n(x) _ F2,n(x)|
x

where F1, n(x) = £22721 I X15), is the observed cumulative distribution func-
tion of the ﬁrst sample, and similarly F2,n(x) is the observed cumulative
distribution function of the second sample. The ﬁrst sample, in our case,
refers to the observed distances between the variants. The second sample
refers to the distances between the variants obtained under the null hy-
pothesis using permutations.

We also considered an alternative approach, called the Bin test statistic
that extends the idea in Kowalski et a]. (2002) and Olson et a]. (2005). The
Bin test is a permutation test that compares the observed proportions of
distances in 10 given intervals to the expected proportions of distances
using the M statistic (referred to as the Bin test):

M 2 (Prop — E(Pr0p))TS(_1)(Pr0p — E(Pr0p))

The distances between the variants obtained using permutations under
the null are ordered and put into 10 bins with equal size, therefore there
are 10% of all the distances in each of the 10 bins. Thus, E(Pr0p) is set to
be a 10 X 1 vector of 10% in this statistic, i.e. (0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1,
0.1, 0.1, 0.1, 0.1). Then, the minimum and maximum of the distances in
each bin give the interval of distance of each bin. Prop is then the 10 x 1
vector of the proportions of the observed distances in these 10 intervals.
S (‘1) is the 10 X 10 Moore—Penrose generalized inverse of the variance
covariance matrix of the proportions of distances in the 10 intervals from
each permutation under the null. The number of equally spaced bins
could be varied, and unequally spaced bins could be used, as discussed
in White et a]. (2009). We chose 10 equally spaced bins here to simplify
the problem, but further investigation is needed to evaluate the perform-
ance of the statistic with other choices.

For both the KS and the Bin tests, the null distribution of distances is
obtained by permuting the case and control status among the subjects,
which conserves the LD between the variants.

Other distribution tests could also be used here, such as the Ansari—
Bradley test. From a limited number of simulations, the Ansari—Bradley
test gives a moderate power that is higher than the KS test, but does not
perform as good as the Bin test (data not shown here).

2.4 Summary of the method

Here is a summary of the procedure of the method:

(1) Choose a P-value cutoff P and a cutoff R for the number of
neighboring variants to be included in the calculation.

(2) Calculate the single-variant association P-values and include only
variants with single-variant association P-value that is smaller than
the cutoff P.

(3) Calculate the new distance measure for each variant with their
neighboring variants within the cutoff number R. The distance
measures form a distribution of observed distances.

(4) By permuting the case and control status, using the same cutoffs,
we get a different distribution of the distances under the null for
each permutation.

(5) By putting all the distances obtained under the null together to
form the null distribution, the Bin statistic (or the KS statistic) can
be calculated for the observed distance distribution.

(6) Similarly, for each permutation, the Bin statistic (or the KS statis-
tic) can be calculated.

(7) Compute the P-value of the test by comparing the Bin statistic
(or the KS statistic) of the observed distance distribution to the
distribution of the Bin statistics (or the KS statistic) obtained from
permutations under the null.

3 RESULTS

We assessed the performance of the KS test and the Bin test using
simulations based on the genotypes of the African American (AA)
samples in the GWAS dataset of the COPDGene study (Regan
et al., 2011). Also, the Bin test was applied to the COPD status of
several collaborating COPD genetic studies to look for COPD
susceptibility loci in the application section.

3.1 Simulation results

3.1.] Simulation results on entire chromosome Simulations were
done using the genotypes of the AA samples from the COPDGene
study. There are approximately 700k SNPs included for the 2570
AA samples after the quality control (QC) steps for this study.
Variants with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 0.01, high missing
rate (>5% for SNPs with MAF Z 5%, and >2% for SNVs with
MAF g 5%), Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE) P < lOe — 3
and concordance rate < 99% using 205 duplicated samples were
removed. Samples with call rate <98.5%, and mismatched
gender and race were also excluded. Autosomal SNPs with
HWE P >0.01, MAF > 0.05 and markers represented in
Hapmap III were used for principal component analysis.
EIGENSOFT 3.0 was used to obtain the PCs to adjust for popu-
lation substructure for the AA samples. We used 2569 samples in
our simulations due to missing information for one case.

In our simulations, we used the genetic data on chromosome 7
from the COPDGene study, but generated the case and control
status according to our disease model. There are in total 36 726
SNPs on chromosome 7. Two different scenarios were con-
sidered. First, we selected nine SNPs on chromosome 7 as the
causal variants that reside close to each other, and considered
both protective and deleterious effects of the variants and differ-
ent effect size. The MAF of the nine SNVs are (0.1740, 0.4914,
0.1734, 0.1244, 0.4673, 0.2552, 0.1098, 0.0309, 0.0728). The phys-
ical distances between the adjacent variants are 530, 1564, 1011,
813, 1087, 249, 685 and 707. The LDs between the nine causal
variants in the dataset are shown in Figure 1. Two sets of effect
sizes are simulated for this scenario. For scenario 1, the odds
ratio of the nine SNVs are (0.8, 1.1, 0.9, 1.2, 0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.5,
1.5) and the average disease rate of our disease model for this
population is 0.145; for scenario 2, the odds ratio of the nine

N ote: The power of the tests for three scenarios, obtained from 200 simulations with
2000 permutations in each permutation set. The power is the number of simulations
with P< 0.05. The effect sizes (odds ratio) of the nine SNVs with the intercept at the
front are effect size 1: (0.135, 0.8, 1.1, 0.9, 1.2, 0.9, 1.2, 1.2, 1.5, 1.5) and effect size 2:
(0.135, 0.8, 1.1, 0.8, 1.3, 0.9, 1.3, 1.2, 1.5, 1.5) for the ﬁrst two columns. For effect
size 3, 100 SNVs were chosen within a random segment on the chromosome and are
assigned with randomly generated effect sizes from a normal distribution with mean
1 and SD = 0.05 with an intercept odds of l in each simulation.

SNVs are (0.8, 1.1, 0.8, 1.3, 0.9, 1.3, 1.2, 1.5, 1.5) and the average
disease rate of our disease model for this population is 0.150.
Then given the effect size and the genotypes of the samples in the
COPDGene study, we generated the case and control status ac-
cordingly. Second, we considered the possibility of having a lot
of causal variants with small effect size. Thus, 100 causal variants
were chosen in proximity to each other on the chromosome by
randomly selecting 100 variants in a randomly selected region on
the chromosome. The effect sizes (odds ratio) were generated
using a normal distribution with mean 1 and SD = 0.05.

Sensitivity analysis was done to assess the effects of the
P-value cutoff P, and the number of neighboring variants R,
on the power and type I error of the Bin test for different disease
models and sample size. The results and discussions are in the
Supplementary Material. According to the analysis, the optimal
cutoff values are similar with different disease models and sample
sizes we considered, and the power is mostly robust to the cutoff
values in general, as long as extreme cutoff values are not used.
Here to achieve a good power, SNVs with P-value in the top
0.5% percentile were included in the analysis, and 0.1% >I<N
neighboring SNVs next to each SNV were used in the tests,
where N is the total number of SNVs in the dataset. Owing to
the computational limitation, 2000 permutations were used in
each permutation set to maintain the type I error, as explained
in our sensitivity analysis (Supplementary Material). For each
scenario, 200 simulations were generated to obtain the estimated
power and the type I error rate. The power of the test is the
percentage of simulations in which the permutation P-value is
<0.05. The results of the Bin test are shown in Table l, as well as
the power of the KS test, as a comparison. We observed a higher
power of the Bin test comparing with the KS test in all the
scenarios. Therefore, the Bin test is recommended and is used
in the calculation of the association P—values of the chromosomes
in the application section.

We also computed the type I error rate of the Bin test on three
different autosomal chromosomes by randomly generating the
probability of having the disease for each individual using a uni-
form distribution Unif(0, 0.5), and then randomly generated the
disease status for each sample using a Bernoulli distribution with
these probabilities. It is shown in Table 2 that the type I error
rate is well maintained with different LD patterns on different
chromosomes.

Note: 2000 permutations in each permutation set were used and 200 replicates were
generated to compute the type I error rate.

3.2 Application results

3.2.] Results on each chromosome The test was applied to a
case-control cohort from Bergen, Norway with 863 cases and
808 controls (Cho et al., 2012) from the GenKOLS study
(Pillai et al., 2009) to see if there is any chromosome that is
signiﬁcantly clustered with variants associated with COPD
status. Based on the dataset that passed the QC steps from
Cho et al. (2012), any SNVs with MAF <0.01, call rate
<98% and HWE P <0.000001 were also removed, and we
were left with 495 829 SNVs for the autosomal chromosomes.
Population outliers were further removed, and we were left with
854 cases and 805 controls. We also applied the test to the ﬁrst
1000 subjects from the COPDGene study (Cho et al., 2012).
Based on the dataset that passed the QC steps from Cho et al.
(2012) and after additional QC steps as for the GenKOLS data-
set, 797 218 SNVs were left and 496 cases and 498 controls were
used for the association tests. Similarly to the simulations, the
cutoff value for the association P-value percentiles was set to be
0.5%, and the quantile of neighboring SNVs around each SNV
to be included in the analysis was set to be 0.1%. The P—values
for the test of clustering on each chromosome were obtained
using 2000 permutation set.

Association P—values of the Armitage trend test for the SNVs,
adjusted for ancestry, were computed for the samples and are
plotted in Figures 2 and 3 later in the text for the two cohorts.
We included age, sex and pack-years of smoking as the covari-
ates in our analyses. For the GenKOLS cohort, the order of
the SNVs according to their signiﬁcance magnitude is mostly
the same as in the original article (Pillai et al., 2009), and the
Manhattan plot is shown in Figure 2 later in the text. No SNV
reached the genome-wide signiﬁcance level (5 x 10‘8) in our ana-
lysis. The original article identiﬁed two SNVs at the a-nicotinic
acetylcholine receptor (CHRNA3/5) locus on chromosome 15
that were replicated using other datasets. Other studies have
indicated that loci near HHIP may be related to COPD (Pillai
et al., 2009; Wilk et al., 2009). It has also been found from pre-
vious studies that the FAM 13A locus on chromosome 4 includes
a disease susceptibility locus for COPD (Cho et al., 2010).

The results of our clustering method applied on each chromo-
some for each dataset are shown in Table 3. The signiﬁcance
level we used here is 0.05/22 2 0.00227. Surprisingly, we
observed a strong signal on chromosome 10 in the GenKOLS
cohort in which there is no signiﬁcant indication of causal SNVs
from the single variant association tests. From the COPDGene
dataset, there is no chromosome with signiﬁcant P—value, but
chromosome 10 has a small P-value around 0.05. By looking
at only the Manhattan plot, the signiﬁcant P-value in the

GenKOLS cohort seems to be caused by the clustering of many
nearby SNVs with P—values around 10‘3 ~ 10‘4. We also
applied the test on the combined dataset that includes subjects
from the COPDGene study, the GenKOLS COPD cohort and
subjects from Normative Aging study (NAS) and National
Emphysema Treatment Trial (NETT) (Cho et al., 2012). Note
that the GenKOLS cohort is a more homogeneous population
than the other two cohorts. As we know from previous studies
that there are causal variants residing on Chromosome 4 and 15,
the P—values from our clustering method for the two chromo-
somes are signiﬁcant. Chromosome 10 also has a relatively small
P—value after combining the three cohorts.

3.2.2 More insights for chromosome 10 The distribution of the
new distances D for chromosome 10 of the GenKOLS cohort is
shown in Figure 4. Our test compares this observed distribution
with the distance distribution obtained using permutations under
the null (8000 permutations were used here). Each bin of the
histogram contains 10% of the distances obtained using permu-
tation under the null, therefore we can see that the signiﬁcant
difference between the distributions comes from the ﬁrst bin,
in which there is a much larger proportion of the observed dis-
tances. The 10% quantile of the distances obtained under the null
is 1447. We are interested to see which pairs of SNVs contribute
the most to this difference between the two distributions. Figure 5
shows the physical positions of the SNVs with their P—values on

ently one cluster on chromosome 10. Most of the SNVs in this
cluster reside on CIOorfII. This result is interesting as it has been
shown in a large-scale GWAS that this gene is associated with
lung function (Artigas et al., 2011). The original GWAS includes
48 201 individuals of European ancestry with an additional 46 41 1
individuals in the follow-up study, whereas in our dataset there
are less than 1700 subjects included. Thus this result shows that
our method could have much higher power in detecting the causal
variants by considering the physical locations of SNVs and treat-
ing it as a clustering problem.

We further applied our method on this interesting gene
CIOorfII and obtained a P <0.0001 (10000 permutations have
been done here). Note that the P—value should be compared with
the signiﬁcance level after adjusting for all the genes on the
genome. For the application on genes, we used all the SNVs
on the gene to calculate the test statistic, i.e. no P—value cutoff
or threshold for the number of neighboring SNVs. The LD plot
and the association plot of this locus are shown in Figure 6. We
also applied the SKAT (Wu et al., 2011) and its optimal version
(SKAT-O) (Lee et al., 2012) to this gene, and obtained P—values
of 0.558 and 0.733, respectively. We expected to observe such

difference in the P—values, as this gene satisﬁes the hypothesis of
our tests; therefore our test should have more power under such
situation. This observation is also supported by the simulation
results shown in Supplementary Table 84. Some of the SNVs in
the cluster on chromosome 10 seem to lie in the gene KCNMAI,
therefore we applied our test on this gene, which is next to
C100rf11. It turns out that the P-value is 0.67732, showing no
sign of association. We also applied our test on the candidate

genes FAMI3A and CHRNA3/5 locus, the P—values are 0.01159
and 0.07147787, respectively, for the GenKOLS cohort. For the
COPDGene cohort, CIOorfII has a P-value of 0.06943, which is
not signiﬁcant, possibly due to low power.

3.2.3 Result on the entire genome We have also applied the test
to the entire genome to see if there is any region in the genome
that is clustered with the causal variants. Same P-value cutoff
and threshold for calculating the distances to the neighboring
SNV are used. With 1500 permutations set, the P-value is
0.069315 for the entire genome, showing weak signiﬁcance of
association between the genome and the phenotype. This appli-
cation shows the potential of our method for testing large gen-
omic regions when no signiﬁcant association is found for
univariate tests. One possible way to search for the associated
loci with the phenotype is to conduct a binary search using our
method. Interested readers could refer to the Supplementary
Material for some discussion about the procedure.

4 DISCUSSION

In summary, we proposed here an approach for the detection of
clustering of causal variants in a genomic region of any size.
Many existing methods collapse the effects of variants across a
region or a gene, however, few of them use the physical location
of these variants and many would suffer loss of power when too
many variants are included. Simulations and application results
suggest that our approach provides sufﬁcient power to detect
associated genomic regions with complex disease, especially
when the causal variants reside relatively close to each other,
even with small effect size. Also, the increase in statistical
power allows analyses with a smaller sample size, which enables
the possibility to compare more extreme phenotypes.

The same idea of testing for clustering could be applied to
sequencing data, where thousands of variants would be available
for each gene. For variants that are extremely rare, the univariate
P-value may include only random noise, thus other measures of
the association at each variant need to be considered to apply our
method, i.e. standard analysis approaches for RV analysis.
Moreover, the genomic region could refer to the genes in the
same pathway (Wang et al., 2007), thus whether there is signiﬁ-
cant clustering of small P—values in each pathway could be
examined.

However, there are several drawbacks we need to consider.
Because permutation is used to obtain the P-value of the test
statistic, there is extensive computational cost if the test is applied
to a large number of small regions, which requires more number
of permutations. From our experience, calculating the P-value
for a dataset containing ~35k SNVs and 2570 subjects with a
quantile P-value cutoff 0.5% (which is equivalent to including
about 180 SNVs) and number of neighboring variants cutoff
0.1% (which is equivalent to 35 neighboring variants for each
SNV), and with 5000 permutations, takes ~22h using a
800MHz AMD Phenom II X4 9106 CPU. To obtain the
P-value for different regions, clusters can be used to parallel
the work. Second, the power may also be compromised if the
regions are extremely small, limiting the possibility of clusters
and their detection, and if the number of regions to be tested
are extremely large due to multiple-testing problem. Right now

the method is limited to population-based studies because per-
mutation of the affections status is used to evaluate the P—values,
but because the associations are represented by P—values, which
could be obtained from either population-based association tests
or family-based association tests, there is potential to extend the
approach to family-based association studies.

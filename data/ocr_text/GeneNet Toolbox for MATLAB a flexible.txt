ABSTRACT

Summary: We present GeneNet Toolbox for MATLAB (also available
as a set of standalone applications for Linux). The toolbox, available as
command-line or with a graphical user interface, enables biologists to
assess connectivity among a set of genes of interest (‘seed-genes’)
within a biological network of their choosing. Two methods are
implemented for calculating the signiﬁcance of connectivity among
seed-genes: ‘seed randomization’ and ‘network permutation’.
Options include restricting analyses to a specified subnetwork of the
primary biological network, and calculating connectivity from the
seed-genes to a second set of interesting genes. Pre—analysis tools
help the user choose the best connectivity-analysis algorithm for their
network. The toolbox also enables visualization of the connections
among seed-genes. GeneNet Toolbox functions execute in reason-
able time for very large networks (~10 million edges) on a desktop
computer.

Availability and implementation: GeneNet Toolbox is open source
and freely available from http://avigailtaylor.github.io/gntat14.
Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

In search of the genetic causes of diseases, high-throughput ex-
periments, such as genome-wide association and gene expression
studies, are often used to ﬁnd putatively causative genetic vari-
ants. Such experiments implicate many genes (‘seed-genes’); to
gain insights into the biological mechanisms through which these
genes’ variants exert their effects, we often explore the hypothesis
that the seed-genes participate in a shared biological pathway or
process. To this end, within a given biological network, (say, a
protein—protein interaction (PPI) or gene co-expression net-
work), we can count the direct connections between the seed-
genes [seed-genes and direct connections between them comprise
the ‘direct network’ (see Supplementary Figure SlA)], and deter-
mine if this ‘direct seed connectivity’ is more than expected by
chance.

Broadly speaking, there are two ways to assess direct seed
connectivity within a network of interest: In ‘seed randomization’
(SR), we keep the network the same, randomly select gene-sets

equal in size to the set of seed-genes, and obtain an empirical
P—Value by comparing the direct seed connectivity to the con-
nectivity of the random gene-sets (see Supplementary Figure
S2A); conversely, in ‘network permutation’ (NP), we keep
seed-genes the same, permute the edges of the network many
times (while preserving node degree and network clustering
structure), and obtain an empirical P—Value by comparing the
direct seed connectivity in the real versus permuted networks
(see Supplementary Figure S2B and Supplementary
Information for algorithmic details).

Sometimes, experimental biases inﬂuence seed-gene selection;
for example, when using RNA-sequencing to call differentially
expressed genes, there is a length bias towards longer transcripts
(Oshlack and Wakeﬁeld, 2009). In such cases, gene attributes
affected by these biases must be accounted for when assessing
direct seed connectivity. In SR, we can do this by matching gene
attributes of randomized gene-sets to the real set of seed-genes
(see Supplementary Figure S3; note this approach will not work
if seed-genes have unique attributes). In other scenarios, the bio-
logical network used to determine direct seed connectivity may
be subject to an ascertainment bias; for example, gene—gene con-
nections reported in PPIs are biased by the number of studies
pertaining to processes in which gene products participate
(Rossin et al., 2011). With SR, we can account for an ascertain-
ment bias by matching randomized genes to real seed-genes by
degree. However, if such a bias is the primary concern, then NP
should be used to better account for node degree [on condition
that the network in question can be sufﬁciently permuted, while
preserving its clustering structure (see Additional features)]. NP
can also be used to evaluate three further properties of the seed-
gene network [proposed in (Rossin et al., 2011), but renamed
here]: ‘seed direct degrees mean’; ‘seed indirect degrees mean’;
and ‘common connectors degrees mean’. [The latter two proper-
ties use the ‘indirect network’ among seed-genes (see
Supplementary Figure S1B); Supplementary Figures S4—S6 ex-
plain these properties.] Last, NP can help identify which seed-
genes, if any, might be hubs in the direct network (see
Supplementary Figure S4).

1.1 Existing platforms

A popular implementation of NP is the online resource Disease
Association Protein-Protein Link Evaluator (DAPPLE) (Rossin
et al., 2011). Crucially, unlike other implementations of NP
(Alexeyenko et al., 2012; Poirel et al., 2011), the DAPPLE NP
algorithm preserves not only node-degree but also network

clustering structure. However, DAPPLE has important limita-
tions: its web-based interface forces users to compete with global
users for resources and is a bottleneck in any high-throughput
pipeline; in addition, users are constrained to use DAPPLE’s
built-in PPI. GeneNet Toolbox addresses these problems: it is
standalone, can be run from the command-line, and allows
ﬂexible input. Moreover, it employs a MATLAB-optimized
NP algorithm that preserves both node degree and clustering
structure (see Supplementary Information for a performance
comparison), calculates the same network properties for lists of
seed-genes as DAPPLE, and also enables additional analyses
(described later).

2 FEATURES

Users access GeneNet Toolbox Via a graphical user interface, or
by calling command-line functions (see user manual available as
Supplementary Information). The toolbox enables users to assess
seed-gene connectivity in a user-speciﬁed network using either
SR or NP. With SR users can account for gene-attributes.
Two extensions are available for both methods. The first restricts
an analysis to a speciﬁed sub-network of the primary biological
network (a ‘background’; see Supplementary Figure S7), thus
enabling the user to assess the connectivity of seed-genes
within a particular genic context, rather than against a ‘whole-
genome’ background. This might be useful, for example, in the
analysis of a behavioural disorder, when a user might want to
compare the connectivity of seed-genes to genes associated with
behaviour, rather than to all genes. The second extension calcu-
lates connectivity from the initial seed-genes to a second set of
interesting genes (a ‘backbone’; see Supplementary Figure S8).
Thus, for example, in analysing the genetic causes of a disease, a
user could assess connectivity of seed-genes to previously identi-
ﬁed candidate— genes for that disease. The extensions can be com-
bined (see Supplementary Figure S9). If available, multiple
processors can be used to reduce run-time. To Visualize the
seed-gene direct network users choose the ‘quickview’ option,
or output the network as a tab-delimited text ﬁle formatted for
Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011). Input ﬁles are tab-delimited text
ﬁles; results ﬁles are text ﬁles.

2.1 Additional features

As noted above, when network ascertainment bias is of concern
(e.g. in a PPI), seed-gene connectivity is likely assessed more

accurately with NP than SR. However, for NP to work it must
be possible to permute a network sufﬁciently while preserving its
clustering structure. To assess a network’s suitability for NP, we
provide a pre-analysis tool ‘Network permutation analyser’ (see
user manual). The tool summarizes a network’s clustering struc-
ture using the global and mean local clustering coefﬁcients, (Luce
and Perry, 1949; Watts and Strogatz, 1998), comparing these
attributes to those obtained for permuted networks. Heuristic
measures indicating the effect of network permutations are also
provided: for N permutations (set by the user) the tool: (i) shows
the mean percentage of edges remaining unbroken per permuta-
tion; and (ii) plots the percent of edges remaining unbroken after
1..N permutations. Finally, we expect that networks in which
hub-genes are connected to hub-genes will be hardest to permute,
so to assess network assortatiVity we plot the neighbour connect-
ivity distribution (Maslov and Sneppen, 2002).

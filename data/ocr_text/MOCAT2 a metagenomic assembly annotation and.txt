Abstract

Summary: MOCAT2 is a software pipeline for metagenomic sequence assembly and gene prediction
with novel features for taxonomic and functional abundance profiling. The automated generation
and efficient annotation of non—redundant reference catalogs by propagating pre—computed assign—
ments from 18 databases covering various functional categories allows for fast and comprehensive
functional characterization of metagenomes.

Availability and Implementation: MOCAT2 is implemented in Perl 5 and Python 2.7, designed for
64—bit UNIX systems and offers support for high—performance computer usage via LSF, PBS or SGE

queuing systems; source code is freely available under the GPL3 license at http://mocat.embl.de.

1 Introduction

Metagenomics has enabled large—scale studies investigating the
structure, function and diversity of microbial communities. The
computational analysis of samples, often totaling many gigabases of
sequence data, usually involves mapping reads to taxonomic and
functional reference databases (which may require the de novo as—
sembly of predicted genes), and subsequent abundance profiling.
Whereas taxonomic profiling methodology has matured recently
(Segata et al., 2013; Sunagawa et al., 2013), functional profiling still
remains challenging due to the difficulties in assigning functions to
millions of reads from metagenomes. Moreover, current metage—
nomic pipelines (Abubucker et al., 2012; Bose et al., 2015; Edwards
et al., 2012; Glass et al., 2010; Huson et al., 2011; Lingner et al.,
2011; Markowitz et al., 2008; Meinicke, 2015; Glass et al., 2010;

tional annotation and/0r profiling mainly implement metabolic
pathway or protein domain databases (Segata et al., 2013) such as
KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2014), SEED (Overbeek et al., 2014) or
Pfam (Finn et al., 2014). Here, we present metagenomic analysis
toolkit version 2 (MOCAT2), which was developed to enable func—
tional profiling of metagenomes based on a much wider range and
diversity of functional gene annotations. Its features are compared
to existing tools in Supplementary Table Sl.

Fig. 1. The MOCAT2 pipeline. Read quality control, assembly and gene predic-
tion represent the original MOCAT pipeline (dark green box). Blue path: Genes
are clustered into reference gene catalogs, which are functionally annotated.
Orange path: To quantify functional composition, reads are mapped to the
annotated gene catalog and summarized over the respective annotation cate-
gories. Taxonomic profiles (mOTU, specl and NCBI) are generated by map-
ping reads to mOTU and reference marker gene (RefMG) catalogs

Table 1. Databases from which functional properties are obtained

publicly available resources that cover diverse functional properties
(Table 1). The databases were selected to include large, widely used
protein databases, as well as ones targeting specific functional catego—
ries (Supplementary Text). Each database has been filtered for rele—
vance, for example from the eukaryote—centered database DrugBank
only the genes with bacterial homologs were extracted.

To avoid the computational burden of mapping reads to multiple
databases, predicted genes are first clustered using CD-HIT (Huang
et al., 2010) into a non—redundant gene set, called a reference gene
catalog (Qin et al., 2010). Next, this gene catalog is mapped to the
eggNOG database with wide taxonomic coverage of orthologous
groups, to which sequence annotations from other databases have been
pre—computed so that functional information from multiple databases
can be transferred efficiently to the catalog. This indirect annotation
methodology not only provides a 10—fold speed up compared to dir—
ectly mapping to each database separately, but also enables annota—
tions of short genes, which would otherwise be missed (Supplementary
Figure Fig. S1). For computational efficiency MOCAT2 uses
DIAMOND (Buchfink et al., 2014) in the annotation step. Combined,
these features yield a more than 1400—fold annotation speedup over a
conventional BLAST—based annotation pipeline (Supplementary Text).
Users can either create and annotate their own gene catalogs de now,
or use pre—computed and pre—annotated reference gene catalogs for the
human gut and skin, mouse gut, or the ocean (Li et al., 2014; Oh et al.,
2014; Sunagawa et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2015).

Finally, to quantify functional composition, reads from each
sample are mapped to the annotated gene catalog and summarized
over the respective annotation categories (Fig. 1).

MOCAT2 now also offers several approaches for taxonomic
profiling, all of which are based on mapping reads to a benchmarked
set of single copy marker genes (Fig. 1). Taxonomic abundance esti—
mates are calculated not only for different NCBI taxonomic levels,
but also for species clusters defined based on molecular sequence
identity (specI; Mende et al., 2013) and species that currently lack
sequenced reference genomes based on metagenomic operational
taxonomic units (mOTU; Sunagawa et al., 2013).

3 Annotation and profiling benchmarks

As complex functional annotation based on 18 databases via indir—
ect propagation of eggNOG annotations is conceptually new, we
benchmarked the (indirect) MOCAT2 annotations and functional
profiles (Supplementary Table S2 and Supplementary Text).

First, we compared the indirect annotations to the direct ones
(generated using the annotation tool of each individual database or
recommended pipeline and cutoffs) for >65 million genes from five
diverse datasets (precision and recall are listed in Table 1).

Next, using data from (Zeller et al., 2014) we compared the dir—
ect annotations to ones produced by COGNIZER and UProC (Bose
et al., 2015 ; Meinicke et al., 2015), two recently developed annota—
tion tools integrating multiple databases. In our tests, MOCAT2 an—
notations were either similar to, or more accurate, than those of
COGNIZER and UProC (Supplementary Table S3).

Finally, the functional abundance profiles obtained using the in—
direct MOCAT2 annotations were very similar to those obtained
using the direct method (Spearman : 0.95 ; n = 1300).

4 Conclusions

MOCAT2 is a software pipeline for metagenomics using state of the
art assembly, annotation as well as taxonomic and functional profil-
ing approaches in this fast moving field. Generating and annotating
gene catalogs with precomputed assignments to a large selection of
functional databases allows for comprehensive and efficient func-
tional profiling of complex microbial communities. MOCAT2 thus
enables such analysis at an extent far beyond what other tools cur—
rently offer and is scalable to the anticipated deluge of metagenomic
data from diverse sources.

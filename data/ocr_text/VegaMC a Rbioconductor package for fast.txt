ABSTRACT

Summary: Identification of genetic alterations of tumor cells has
become a common method to detect the genes involved in develop-
ment and progression of cancer. In order to detect driver genes, sev-
eral samples need to be simultaneously analyzed. The Cancer
Genome Atlas (T CGA) project provides access to a large amount of
data for several cancer types. TGCA is an invaluable source of infor-
mation, but analysis of this huge dataset possess important compu-
tational problems in terms of memory and execution times. Here, we
present a R/package, called VegaMC (Vega multi-channel), that en-
ables fast and efficient detection of significant recurrent copy number
alterations in very large datasets. VegaMC is integrated with the output
of the common tools that convert allele signal intensities in log R ratio
and B allele frequency. It also enables the detection of loss of hetero-
zigosity and provides in output two web pages allowing a rapid and
easy navigation of the aberrant genes. Synthetic data and real data-
sets are used for quantitative and qualitative evaluation purposes. In
particular, we demonstrate the ability of VegaMC on two large TGCA
datasets: colon adenocarcinoma and glioblastoma multiforme. For
both the datasets, we provide the list of aberrant genes which contain
previously validated genes and can be used as basis for further
investigations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genetic alterations, such as deletions, ampliﬁcation and loss of
heterozigosity (LOH), represent an important component of
tumor initialization and progression. Technologies based on
Array Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) enabled
the study of copy number alterations (CNAs) in cancer and de-
velopmental disorders. Recently, high-density single-nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) genotyping arrays (SNP-CGH) using a
combination of two genotyping parameters, a normalized inten-
sity measurement and an allelic ratio, have been used to detect
CNAs, including LOH, with a high level of accuracy and reso-
lution. Genotyping data consist of two channel intensity data

corresponding to the two alleles used to compute normalized
intensity and allele frequency. Supplementary Figure S1 shows
the typical analysis process that starting from raw data enables
the detection of candidate genes. Analysis starts with processing
of raw data for extraction of allele signal intensities. These in-
tensity values are successively used to compute the log R ratio
(LRR) and B allele frequency (BAF) associated with each probe.
LRR and BAF are calculated by comparing the intensities of
tumor samples with the intensities of the respective normal sam-
ples or alternatively with the intensities of a reference genome
(such as, the HapMap reference genome) as also reported in the
Supplementary Information. Data are then segmented or
smoothed both to decrease the noise level and to aggregate ad-
jacent probes into a single region. Generally, segmentation and
data smoothing are performed on one sample at time and results
are independent across the samples. The ‘adjusted’ dataset is the
input for the next analysis tool that looks for recurrent CNAs.
The distinction between regions functionally related with the
tumor (driver CNA) and regions that are detected as altered
by biological and experimental noise is a critical step for these
tools. In order to deal with this problem, statistical frameworks
have been widely used to compute the probability associated
with driver mutations. Of course, these frameworks can gain
statistical strength by the analysis of a large amount of samples.
In this scenario, the TCGA project (Collins and Barker, 2007)
represents an invaluable source of information, indeed, the
TCGA database provides thousands of copy number samples
for common cancer types. Given the resolution of SNP—CGH
(with Affymetrix SNP6.0 ~2 millions of probes are observed
for each sample), analysis of these large datasets is not a trivial
task. In particular, for large datasets, memory and time require-
ments often represent enormous obstacles for most analysis
tools. In the last step of the analysis, available online databases
are used to get information on the genes overlapping the identi-
ﬁed driver CNA.

Here, we present a R/bioconductor package that, exploiting a
novel multichannel segmentation algorithm, identiﬁes the driver
genes from LRR and BAF observations (Supplementary Fig.
S1). We test VegaMC both on synthetic data which have been
previously used to compare performance of other algorithms and
on two TCGA datasets: colon adenocarcinoma (COAD) and
glioblastoma multiforme (GBM). The analyzed TCGA datasets
are composed of 424 samples of COAD and 571 samples of
GBM, most of the tumor samples are also matched with
normal tissues for a total of 870 samples in the COAD dataset
and 992 samples in the GBM dataset, the processing of these

data represents a challenging task. Results are publicly available
and they can be used for further investigations.

2 VEGAMC

VegaMC extends the variational segmentation algorithm pro-
posed in Morganella et al. (2010) in order to simultaneously
perform the segmentation of all the samples. The joint segmen-
tation allows better results to be obtained both in terms of ac-
curacy, since the detection of copy number breakpoints can be
based on the evidence from multiple signals, and in terms of
computational efﬁciency as reported in the results. Joint segmen-
tation allows the enhancement of systematic biases leading to the
appearance of consistent breakpoints. The segmented regions are
then classiﬁed, sample by sample, as deletions, ampliﬁcations
and LOH and a statistical framework is used to assess the stat-
istical signiﬁcance associated with driver CNA. The statistical
framework is based on a conservative permutation test similar
to the one previously described in Morganella et al. (2011) per-
formed on at region level (see Supplementary Information for
more algorithmic details).

One aim of VegaMC is to solve some critical points arising
from the analysis process depicted in Supplementary Figure S1.
The ﬁrst issue of this analysis process is the integration of differ-
ent software tools. Integration is not an easy step: software tools
are implemented in different programming languages and output
of a tool needs to be adapted so that it can be used as input for
the next tool. In order to overcome this problem, VegaMC has
been designed so that it is completely compatible with the most
used tools that compute LRR and BAF, such as, PennCNV-Affy
WVang et al., 2007) and BeadStudio (www.illumina.com). In add-
ition, VegaMC performs all steps required for a comprehensive
analysis of high-density aCGH data: from segmentation of LRR
and BAF to the list of driver genes. All the computational de-
manding steps of VegaMC have been implemented in C, we
report later the execution times on huge datasets. Below, we
summarize the main features of VegaMC:

0 Integration with the output of PennCNV-Affy and
Beadstudio.

0 Designed to overcome several steps of the analysis process:
from LRR and BAF to the list of driver genes.

0 Efﬁcient implementation to guarantee execution times which
can cope with very large datasets.

0 User friendly: implemented as a R/Bioconductor package;
web pages are used to allow a rapid navigation of the results;
for each driver gene several pieces of information are pro-
vided (among them, the user ﬁnds the gene symbol, the gen-
omic position, the cytoband, the description and the link to
the respective ensembl web page).

3 RESULTS

In order to perform a quantitative evaluation of VegaMC, we
used a public synthetic dataset (Morganella et al., 2011) that
simulates CNA in different resolution scenarios and in different

noise conditions (biological and experimental noise was simu-
lated to perturb the data, see Supplementary Information).
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2 show that VegaMC provides
good results in all simulated scenarios performance of VegaMC
is always comparable to the best performance of other
algorithms.

Qualitative evaluation of VegaMC has been performed on two
TCGA datasets: COAD and GBM. Datasets are composed of
424 COAD samples and 571 GBM samples, and paired intensi-
ties of tumor-normal samples are used to compute LRR and
BAF (see Supplementary Information). We report the time
required to perform the analyses: ~14’ for COAD and ~18’
for GBM using a Linux server equipped with 2.00 GHz
Xeon—Intel E7540 CPU. The results of the analysis can be
accessed at the webpage http://www.dsba.unisannio.
it/Members/ceccarelli/vegamc/. Results on COAD reveal
common cytogenetic mutations, such as, ampliﬁcation of 8q, 7,
13, 20q, X and deletion on 8p, 15q, 17p and 18q mutations which
include several well-known tumor suppressors (T P53, SMADZ,
SMAD3 and SMADIO and oncogenes (M YC, GNAS,LM07)
(Ashktorab et al., 2010). Also, results on GBM contain many
positive controls, such as, cytogenetic deletions of 9p, 10, 17q
(including tumor suppressors PT EN and CDKNZA) and ampli-
ﬁcation of chromosome 7 (with evident instability of 7p11.2 that
includes the oncogene EGFR) (McLendon et al., 2008). In order
to evaluate the biological coherence of the lists of driver genes,
we investigated enriched canonical pathways and functions
(Supplementary Fig. S2 and S3); for COAD, we ﬁnd
‘Pancreatic Adenocarcinome Signaling’ to be signiﬁcant and
for GBM, we ﬁnd both ‘Glioma Signaling’ and ‘Glioblastoma
Multiforme Signaling’.

Finally, Supplementary Table S3 reports an experimental com-
parison in terms of running times on synthetic and real dataset.
The reported times show that VegaMC outperforms several al-
ternative algorithms aimed at computing recurrent genomic
aberrations.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We presented a new bioconductor/package for the analysis of
high-density aCGH data. VegaMC is integrated with common
LRR and BAF calculation tools and it performs all analysis steps
required to obtain the list of driver genes by exploiting a novel
multichannel segmentation algorithm characterized by efﬁciency
and accuracy. It also enables an easy navigation of the results by
html pages.

We performed analysis of two large TCGA datasets. The ob-
tained gene lists contain several positive controls that highlight
important signaling pathways. Results are publicly available for
download and they can be used as basis for further biological
investigations.

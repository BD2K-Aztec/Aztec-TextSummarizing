Abstract

Motivation: Gaining insight into chemogenomic drug—target interactions, such as those involving
the substructures of synthetic drugs and protein domains, is important in fragment—based drug dis—
covery and drug repositioning. Previous studies evaluated the interactions locally, thereby ignoring
the competitive effects of different substructures or domains, but this could lead to high false—posi—
tive estimation, calling for a computational method that presents more predictive power.

Results: A statistical model, termed Global optimization—based lnFerence of chemogenomic fea—
tures from drug—Target interactions, or GIFT, is proposed herein to evaluate substructure—domain
interactions globally such that all substructure—domain contributions to drug—target interaction are
analyzed simultaneously. Combinations of different chemical substructures were included since
they may function as one unit. When compared to previous methods, GIFT showed better interpret—
ive performance, and performance for the recovery of drug—target interactions was good. Among
53 known drug—domain interactions, 81% were accurately predicted by GIFT. Eighteen of the top
100 predicted combined substructure—domain interactions had corresponding drug—target struc—
tures in the Protein Data Bank database, and 15 out of the 18 had been proved. GIFT was then im—
plemented to predict substructure—domain interactions based on drug repositioning. For example,
the anticancer activities of tazarotene, adapalene, acitretin and raloxifene were identified. In sum—
mary, GIFT is a global chemogenomic inference approach and offers fresh insight into drug—target
interactions.

1 Introduction

Protein domains are independent folding structures and form differ-
ent proteins as the functional units (Chothia, 1984). Compared With
sequence similarity, domain structures are much more conserved
among proteins (Koehn and Carter, 2005). Compound chemical

substructures, or functional scaffolds, are the basic structural and
functional building blocks of small molecules (Bemis et 61]., 1996).
According to Bredel and Jacoby (2004), chemogenomics, or chem—
ical genomics, involves the systematic screening of targeted chemical
libraries of small molecules against individual drug target families

with the goal of identifying new drugs and drug targets. Thus, gath—
ering chemogenomic data about protein domains and the chemical
substructures of drugs underlying drug—target interactions could fos—
ter the development of fragment—based drug discovery, drug repos—
itioning and the understanding of drug—induced side effects (Murray
and Rees, 2009; Yamanishi et al., 2011; Duran—Frigola et al., 2013),
thereby supplementing the network pharmacology methods of target
prediction (Zhao and Li, 2010).

Among 1584 FDA—approved drugs and 89 nutraceuticals from
the DrugBank database (Wishart et al., 2008), only 30% of them
are contained in the Protein Data Bank (PDB) database (Berman
et al., 2000; Gallina et al., 2013). The large gap between the number
of known binding positions and the total number of drug—target
pairs calls for computational models to bridge them. Such computa—
tional models can be classified as structure—based methods and non—
structure—based methods. Structure—based methods, such as docking,
have been developed over the course of many years, but they are
constrained by the dependence on three dimensional structures of
proteins (Sousa et al., 2013; Yang et al., 2013). In recent years, sev—
eral non—structure—based methods, which are not limited by the
structure information have been developed, along the accumulation
of large—scale database in both chemistry and biology.

Yamanishi et al. (2011) developed a sparse canonical correspond—
ence analysis method to extract the associated sets of chemical sub—
structures and protein domains from drug—target interactions, but the
amount of detectable protein domains was relatively small. Takigawa
et al. (2011) applied graph mining and sequence mining to automate
the search for significant substructure patterns, leading to the inter—
pretation of polypharmacology in drug—target network. The substruc—
tures in drugs or proteins did not need to be defined from the
literatures. However, protein substructures, which are generally com—
posed of two or three residues, were difficult to correlate with biolo—
gical interpretations. Tabei et al. (2012) treated this question as a
classification problem in machine learning. They used the logistic re—
gression and support vector machine (SVM) algorithm to seek the
drug chemical substructures and protein domains pairs that could be
used to determine whether drugs and proteins interact or not. This
method showed good results in predicting drug—target interactions.

However, none the methods noted above was able to evaluate
uncertainty or variance of results, and they also ignored the possible
combinations of drug chemical substructures that bind to protein
domains as a whole. More importantly, the competitive effects of
different substructure—domain interactions have never been con—
sidered since prediction has, thus far, been performed locally.

Therefore, in this article, a Global optimization—based InFerence
of chemogenomic features from drug—target interactions, termed
GIFT, was proposed (Fig. 1). Since different drug chemical substruc—
tures and protein domains may competitively contribute to drug——
target interactions, GIFT takes into consideration all the
substructure—domain interactions and treats them as latent variables
leading to drug—target interactions. A substructure—domain inter—
action is defined as a direct physical interaction between a chemical
substructure and a protein domain, for example, a hydrogen bond
between an atom in a chemical substructure and an atom in an
amino acids (Gallina et al., 2013). It should be noted that because
some drug—target interactions have not been recorded in DrugBank,
we incorporated two parameters, namely fp (false—positive rate) and
fn (false—negative rate), to describe data inaccuracy and incomplete—
ness. Then the substructure—domain contributions to different
drug—target pairs were globally analyzed by the expectation—max—
imum (EM) algorithm framework, a statistical method to find the
maximum likelihood estimates when the latent variables exist

(Dempster et al., 1977). Variances in results were calculated by the
observed Fisher Information (Efron et al., 1978). GIFT was further
extended to include the combinations of different drug chemical
substructures based on the likelihood that some may function to—
gether. More than 700 substructure—domain interactions were found
by GIFT. Some were validated by the PDB database. Our approach
is a promising method for investigating drug—target binding pos—
itions and contributes to our understanding in this field.

2 Results

2.1 Robust analysis of fn and fp on recovering
drug—target interactions

As noted above, two parameters, fp and fp should be given in GIFT.
Based on the assumptions in GIFT (see Section 4), we roughly esti—
mated that the value of fn was no less than 0.4 and the value of fp
was no more than 0.001 (see Section 4).

To analyze the robustness of GIFT with different parameters, we
used 5—fold cross validation to detect the recoveries of drug—target
interactions on different combinations of fn and fp. Here the nega—
tive samples were randomly selected from the drug—protein pairs
without interacting records. The results showed that the perform—
ance for recovering drug—target interactions remained stable for dif—
ferent combinations of fn and fp (See Table 1). In GIFT, fn was set
as 0.85 and fp was set as 0.0001.

Following the same cross validation procedure above, we com—
pared GIFT with previous methods, namely, L1—log, L1—SVM (Tabei
et al., 2012), SCCA (Yamanishi et al., 2011) and the association
method (see Section 4), based on their performance for recovery of
drug—target interactions. The association method was a naive ap—
proach to inference of substructure—domain interactions. The area
under the ROC curve (AUC) of the association method is 0.72
(data not shown). Based on the AUC (see Table 2), GIFT performed
better than the association method, L1—L0g method, as well as SCCA,
and it was comparable to L1—SVM for predicting drug—protein
interactions.

Although a large number of substructure—domain interactions
were extracted by the previous methods, for example, more than
350 000 interactions by SCCA (Yamanishi et al., 2011), and around
5000 interactions by L1—SVM (Tabei et al., 2012), it was difficult to
assess the accuracy of these interactions. In the following sections,
we demonstrate that GIFT not only perform better for drug—target
predictions, but also provided better interpretation of the extracted
substructure—domain interactions.

2.2 Performance of prediction on drug—domain
interactions

GIFT was then evaluated for its performance in predicting drug—d0—
main interactions. A total of 108 interactions between 53 proteins and
106 drugs were extracted from the crystallographic structures of
known drug—protein interactions in the PDB database (Kruger et al.,
2012). Domains coexisting in the same proteins were merged, so that
only multidomain proteins were considered after data preprocessing.
Finally 53 pairs of drug—protein interactions including 53 pairs of
drug—domain interactions were left. Then the [a value was used to de—
scribe the number of binding (amino acid) residues of a given drug
were located in a given protein domain. Here [a value was defined as
the proportion of the number of the binding residuals lying within the
protein domain over the total number of binding residuals, given a
drug—target pair. When k value was larger than 0.5, the drug was con—
sidered to interact with the domain (Kruger et al., 2014).

The values are the mean areas under the ROC curves with the standard

The prediction of drug—domain interactions were followed
Equation 2 in Section 4, and each domain was treated as one pro—
tein. A drug and a protein domain were predicted to interact if the
score given by GIFT was larger than zero.

Eighty-one percent of the drug—domain interactions could be pre—
dicted by GIFT. The representative results were shown in Table 3,
and the complete results can be found in Supplementary Material.

2.3 Validation of substructure—domain interactions
A total of 726 substructure—domain interactions, whose scores, given
by GIFT, were larger than their standard deviations, were extracted,
including 255 interactions between substructure combinations and
domains. Since some chemical substructures may function as one unit,
more than 1800 combinations were recorded using the SMARTS for—
mat and added in our model (See Supplementary Material).
Interactions between combinations of chemical substructures
and domains were validated by the known crystal complex contain—
ing the relevant drugs and proteins from the PDB database. Eighteen
of the top 100 predicted interactions between combinations of
chemical substructures and domains have the corresponding drug——
target structures in the PDB database, and 15 of the 18 ones were
successfully predicted (see Table 4).

The values are the mean areas under the ROC curves with the standard

Both methotrexate and pemetrexed are antitumor drugs
(Wishart et al., 2008), and can target against the dihydrofolate re—
ductase and thymidylate synthase. One combination of the substruc—
tures interact with dihydrofolate reductase domain were predicted
by GIFT, in good agreement with the real data (Fig. 2A and B).
DHF, the methotrexate analog, can also interact with thymidylate
synthase and showed the same results (Fig. 2C). It was shown that
methotrexate targeted two different domains with the same sub—
structures. Trimetrexate is one agent against amoebiasis and other
protozoal disease. Although it lacked one predicted substructure,
when compared with methotrexate and pemetrexed, trimetrexate
could still target against dihydrofolate reductase domain by the
other predicted substructure (Fig. 2D). Since it shares the same func—
tional substructure with methotrexate and pemetrexed, trimetrexate
may have similar biological activity. Indeed, it has been tested as an
antitumor drugs (Wishart et al., 2008).

2.4 Interpretation of the drug—protein interactions by
GIFT

We further explored the drug—protein interactions by GIFT, using
four different proteins from Homo sapiens: RARA, RXRA, RXRG
and ESR1 as examples. All have the ligand-binding domain of

nuclear hormone receptor. ESR1 also contains the oestrogen recep—
tor domain. Using GIFT, several chemical substructures were pre—
dicted to interact with the above domains. Drugs having these
chemical substructures that can target at least one of the four pro—
teins were shown in Figure 3. In the original drug—target interactions,
tretinon, adapalene and acitretin targeted against RARA, RXRA
and RXRG. Fulvestrant, raloxifene and letrozole interacted with
ESR1. Tazarotene only targeted RARA. RARA shares the same pro—
tein domain as tretinon, adapalene and acitretin target RXRA and
RXRG. Based on the results of GIFT, the four drugs have the same
chemical substructures predicted to target the ligand—binding do—
main of nuclear hormone receptor (labeled in black in Fig. 3) and
they may, therefore, share the same therapeutic functions. Since tre—
tinoin has anticancer bioactivity, it suggests that acitretin, adapa—
lene, tazarotene and raloxifene may have similar anticancer activity
similar to that of tretinoin. Meanwhile, ﬂuvestrant has the same pre—
dicted chemical substructures with tretinoin, adapalene, and tazaro—
tene. It suggests that fluvestrant may interact with ESR1 by targeting
the ligand—binding domain instead of oestrogen receptor domain.

Recent researches partly confirm the GIFT prediction above. It is
found that adapalene could block cell proliferation and induce
apoptosis on hepatoma cells (Ocker et al., 2004). It was reported
that tazarotene profoundly inhibits murine Basal cell carcinoma by
inducing PI3K-AKT signaling (So et al., 2014). Acitretin and several
analogs exhibited antiproliferative activities against human breast
MCF—7 epithelial cells (Magoulas et al., 2011). Raloxifene, one of
the selective estrogen—receptor modulators, was effective as a pre—
ventive choice in reducing the risk of breast cancer for postmeno—
pausal woman (Vogel et al., 2010).

3 Discussion

In this article, a statistical model, termed GIFT, was constructed to
infer the interactions between drug chemical substructures and pro—
tein domains based on drug—protein interactions data. For the
first time, a global optimization perspective has been introduced into
this computation, meaning that all the substructure—domain contri—
butions on drug—target interactions are simultaneously analyzed.

GIFT has several advantages compared with previous methods.
First, it offers a more detailed description on the drug—protein inter—
actions. Instead of adhering to the constraint which holds that ‘simi-
lar drugs target similar proteins’, we attempt to reveal the possible
mechanisms underlying drug—protein interactions. Second, more
than 350 000 interactions were predicted by SCCA (Yamanishi
et al., 2011), and around 5 000 interactions were predicted by L1—
SVM (Tabei et al., 2012). However, these figures represent local es—
timates, in addition to the lack statistical significance evaluations,
thus potentially overestimating substructure—domain interactions.
GIFT, on the other hand, can reduce such overestimation by incor—
porating a global perspective that accommodates variance estima—
tion. It should be noted that GIFT is limited in that it only focuses
on two—dimensional chemical space, as presented by the 881
PubChem substructures. Therefore, in the future, three—dimensional
structure information should be incorporated into the calculations
(See Section 4). As reﬂected by data already accumulated in the PDB
database, more than 20,000 compound—protein interactions can be
found, including more than 9000 distinct compounds (Gallina et al.,
2013; de Beer et al., 2014). Extraction of these binding information
might result in more precise estimations of the substructure—domain
interactions in the future.

In summary, we propose a novel chemogenomic approach to
infer substructure—domain interactions. It provides a chemogenomic

view of the mechanisms of drug—protein interactions, and can be
used as a new method that contributes to target prediction, drug re—
positioning and drug combination studies.

4 Methods
4.1 Data sources of GIFT

The information of drug—protein interactions, drug substructures, and
protein domains is obtained from Tabei et al., 2012. A total of 1862
drugs are represented by 881—dimensional chemical substructure binary
vectors from PubChem database, and 1554 proteins are represented by
876—dimensional protein domain binary vectors from the Pfam data—
base (Bateman et al., 2004). Here the substructure is defined as a spe—
cific kind of two-dimensional chemical fingerprint by CACTVS. 4809
interactions exist between the drugs and the proteins. We deleted the
drug chemical substructures or protein domains that never appeared in
the drugs or proteins, and we merged those substructures or domains
that appeared in the same drugs or proteins.

The drug—domain interactions were extracted from PDB database
by the script from Kruger et al., 2012. We only chose proteins that had
multiple domains for our data. Finally, 53 pairs of drug—protein inter—
actions with the records of drug—domain interaction were used.

4.2 The EM framework of GIFT

Let Y1 . . . YT denote the T drugs, and P1 . . . P5 denote the S
proteins. Let Z1  ZM denote the M drug chemical substructures
and let D1 . . . DN denote the N protein domains. Let ZDW) denote
the set of the pairs of chemical substructures and domains from drug
Y,- and protein P,- correspondingly. Let ZDmn denote the interaction
result between the chemical substructure Dm and the domain
DWZDSJZB, : 1 if they interact and ZDgZZ : 0 otherwise. Let YPij de—
notes the interaction result between the drug Y,- and the protein Pi.
YP,-,- : 1 if they interact and YP,-,- : 0 otherwise.

Inspired by the work (Deng et al., 2002), we herein propose a stat—
istical method to evaluate the possible interactions between drug
chemical substructures and protein domains. For our calculations, it
was assumed that (i) the interactions of the drug chemical substruc—
tures and the protein domains are independent, given a pair of a drug
and a protein pair; (ii) interactions between a given drug chemical
substructure and protein domain would remain unchanged between
different pairs of the drugs and proteins containing them, as shown by

0,,” = Pr(Df;’2, = 1) (1)

in which 0m" : Pr(D,,m : 1); (iii) drug and the protein will interact
if, and only if, one pair of chemical substructures and domains from
them interact. Based on these assumptions, we can get

Pr(YP,—,— = 1|0) = 1 — H(1 — 0m”) (2)
Don

mn

We include two types of errors in the data of the drug protein
interactions: fp (false positive rate), in which the drug and the
protein do not interact, but are recorded to be interacting, and fn,
in which the drug and the protein interact, but are not recorded.
Let 0,,- be the result of observed interaction between drug Y,- and pro—
tein szOij : 1 if the interaction is observed and 0,,- = 0 otherwise.

Then

fP=P7(Oii: NYE/'20) (3)
fn = Pr(O,-,- = 0|YP.-,— = 1) (4)

Both fn and fp are fixed in GIFT.

It was estimated that on average the number of target proteins
per drug was about 6.3 (Mestres et al., 2008). The value of fn then
would be no less than 0.41. We estimate fp in a similar way and it
would be no more than 0.001.

And the probability for the observed interaction between drug Y,-
and the protein P,- is

Pr(O,-,- = 1|0) = (1 — fn)Pr(YP,—,~ = 1|0) +fp - Pr(YP,—,— = 0|0) (5)

The observed data are the interactions from DrugBank
Database, 0 = {0),- = 0,7}. The complete data include all the drug
chemical substructures and protein domain interactions and the
observed data. Let Am be the set of drugs containing the chemical
substructure Zm and let An be the set of proteins containing the do—
main Dn. Let NW, be the total number of pairs between Am and An.
The EM algorithm as follows:

The variance of the parameters can be estimated by the observed
Fisher information, which is followed:

4.3 The association method

The association method is a naive way to estimate the interactions
between chemical substructures and protein domain, which is the
fraction of interacting drug—protein pairs among all of the drug—pro—
tein pairs containing the pair of chemical substructure Zm and pro—
tein domain D".

 

Imn

in which Imn is the number of interacting pairs of drug—protein pairs
containing the pair of chemical substructure Zm and protein domain
D” and NW, is the number of total drug—protein pairs containing the
pair of chemical substructure Zm and protein domain D".

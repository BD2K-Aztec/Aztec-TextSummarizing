ABSTRACT

Summary: The MolClass toolkit and data portal generate
computational models from user-defined small molecule datasets
based on structural features identified in hit and non-hit molecules
in different screens. Each new model is applied to all datasets in the
database to classify compound specificity. MolClass thus defines
a likelihood value for each compound entry and creates an activity
fingerprint across diverse sets of screens. MolClass uses a variety
of machine-learning methods to find molecular patterns and can
therefore also assign a priori predictions of bioactivities for previously
untested molecules. The power of the MolClass resource will grow
as a function of the number of screens deposited in the database.
Availability and implementation: The MolClass webportal, software
package and source code are freely available for non-commercial use
at http://tyerslab.bio.ed.ac.uk/molclass. A MolClass tutorial and a
guide on how to build models from datasets can also be found on the
web site. MolClass uses the chemistry development kit (CDK), WEKA
and MySQL for its core functionality. A REST service is available
at http://tyerslab.bio.ed.ac.uk/molclass/api based on the OpenTox
APl 1.2.

1 INTRODUCTION

Bioactive molecules can serve as powerful tools for interrogation
of biological systems and/or as precursors in drug discovery. An
objective in chemical systems biology is to model biological systems
in order to understand the effects of small molecules on cellular
processes, and thereby explain the basis for small molecule action
(Hopkins, 2008). Realization of this ambitious goal will require
extensive experimental datasets. The generation of chemical datasets
from biological screening assays is usually limited by cost and
throughput. Pharmaceutical companies and academic groups use
high-throughput screens to test large libraries of small molecules that
elicit a desired biological response, typically against a single target or
at most a few related targets. However, chemical space is estimated
to contain on the order of 1060 molecular entities, which greatly
exceeds even the multi-million compound libraries at the disposal

of large pharmaceutical companies (Dobson, 2004). This vastness of
chemical space requires that researchers devise rational approaches
for identifying small bioactive molecules, particularly given the
severe resource constraints on academic screening initiatives. The
computational evaluation of potential bioactive molecules can drive
down the high cost of screens and help extract potential drug-like
compounds from pre-existing data in the public domain. To enable
the extraction of information from existing chemical screen data,
we have developed a suite of machine-based learning tools that
statistically rank each compound for any given assay in a user-
deﬁned database. MolClass will thus facilitate the identiﬁcation of
speciﬁc bioactive molecules and allow the prediction of moieties
that underpin biological activity.

2 WORKFLOW FEATURES

Existing resources for chemical screen data, notably PubChem,
ChEMBL and ChemBank, are passive repositories that house an
incomplete matrix of small molecule activity across submitted
screens of various types, ranging from in vitro binding and enzyme
assays to complex cellular and whole organism phenotypic assays
(Fig. 1A). To interrogate such data, MolClass generates a complete
matrix of compound activities across many screens and thereby
enables functional predictions for all molecules, even if not tested in
a speciﬁc screen. The user can upload input datasets of up to 20 000
molecules in SDF ﬁle format, in which tags distinguish hit from
non-hit compounds in one or several screens. MolClass combines
the datasets to generate a computational model for each screen
submitted (Fig. 1B). These models are then applied to all molecules
stored in MolClass to predict activity. MolClass currently provides
either a composite of all molecular 2D chemical descriptors (2529
bit) or the user can independently choose 152 property descriptors,
MACCS (166 bit), Substructure (306 bit), CDK extended (1024 bit)
or PubChem (881 bit) ﬁngerprints. As different machine—learning
algorithms tend to generate slightly different likelihood values, a
variety of algorithms are provided in MolClass including Random
Forest, Nai've Bayes, SVM, KNN, Logistic Model Tree and J48. The
user can apply one or several algorithms to any dataset of interest.
Unbalanced datasets are boosted, to maximally double the size of the
smaller part, using SMOTE (Nitesh et al. 2002) and further, if they
exceed a ratio 1:5 of active versus inactive compounds, are adjusted
using the WEKA under-sampling method. All models in MolClass
are then applied to these molecules to generate activity ﬁngerprints.
For training and testing, MolClass uses 10-fold cross-validation.

The user can examine the model statistics, the likelihood scores
for screens of interest and, as shown in Figure 1C, single molecule
likelihood ﬁngerprints for existing models. Finally, MolClass also

enables a substructure search using the JME Editor in the event a
molecule of interest is not present in the database.

3 CONCLUSION

MolClass provides a comprehensive overview of compound activity
in different screens. These proﬁles can reveal promiscuous activities
across several screens, which may reﬂect undesirable off-target
effects. For experimental datasets, the user can discover structure
activity relationships because similar structures and activities will
lead to speciﬁc likelihood patterns. As the data collection is
expanded by users to different biological responses and assay
formats, the classiﬁcation power of the portal will increase, and
thereby facilitate chemical systems biology.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

MolClass is implemented in Java and Perl using CDK (Steinbeck
et al. 2003), WEKA (Hall et al. 2009) and moldb4 (Haider, 2010).
The web interface and REST service are written in PHP5, Slim and
PEAR and run on a Fedora Linux 8 server, as an Apache HTTP
service. The data are stored in a MySQL 5.5 database running on a
separate Fedora Linux 16 server.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present bammds, a practical tool that allows visualiza-
tion of samples sequenced by second-generation sequencing when
compared with a reference panel of individuals (usually genotypes)
using a multidimensional scaling algorithm. Our tool is aimed at deter-
mining the ancestry of unknown samples—typical of ancient DNA
data—particularly when only low amounts of data are available for
those samples.

1 INTRODUCTION

Population structure plays an important role in determining the
evolutionary history of a group. A great deal has been learned
from single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) array technology
providing unmatched information of the population structure
of several species [for humans, see (Novembre and
Ramachandran, 2011)]. The advent of new sequencing plat-
forms, which can deliver millions to billions of sequencing
reads within days, has shifted the focus from SNP array data
to whole-genome shotgun (WGS) data. While the cost has stead-
ily decreased (Sboner et al., 2011), obtaining many high-depth
genomes remains prohibitive for many laboratories, in particular
when working with ancient DNA (aDNA) samples where it is

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

often desirable to screen many samples of potential interest while
keeping the cost at a minimum.

Methods based on non-parametric multidimensional statistics
(more speciﬁcally principal components analysis, PCA) were ﬁrst
applied to genetic data more than 30 years ago (Menozzi et al.,
1978). PCA has since become a standard tool in population gen-
etics (Patterson et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2014) owing in particu-
lar to (i) the low computational demand of such analyses, (ii) the
appealing graphical result and (iii) its ease of use.

Here, we describe a tool that allows to assign an ancestry to
low-depth mapped WGS data when compared with an existing
reference panel of genotype data using multidimensional scaling
(MDS) based on genetic distances, a related method that pro-
vides results similar to those of PCA (Cox and Cox, 2000).

2 METHODS

In what follows, we assume that WGS data have been mapped to a
reference genome and that ﬁles in BAM format are available (Li et al.,
2009). Calling genotypes for low-depth data is a challenging task (Nielsen
et al., 2011), particularly for aDNA, as ancient damage (Briggs et al.,
2007) and contamination are not incorporated into sequence data error
models.

To avoid calling genotypes, we sample a read at every position for the
WGS data, similar in spirit to previous aDNA approaches (Green et al.,
2010). Speciﬁcally, for the reference set of individuals, we randomly
sample one of the alleles from each individual, and for the WGS data,
we choose an allele from a randomly selected read covering that site. If no
read covers that site or if the sampled allele is not the minor or the major
allele in the reference panel, we then assume that the data for this site are
missing for that sample. In other words, the data in both the reference
panel and the WGS samples become either one allele (A, C, G or T) or
missing data.

For site k, let d;- = 1 if individuals i and j have a different randomly
chosen allele and 0 if that allele is the same or if one of the individuals has
missing data. Assume that the number of sites in the reference panel is K.
Denote 1%,]- as the number of sites where neither of individual i and j have
missing data. Then, the allele-sharing distance between individuals i and j

is as follows:

1 K
9:324;-

ljk=1

A matrix D = (dij) of allele-sharing distances between all pairs of individ-
uals is computed. We then apply classical MDS to this matrix [e.g. (Cox
and Cox, 2000)].

Our implementation has three major features:

0 it is user friendly and is intended to be used by biologists with limited
familiarity with a UNIX system,

c it is ﬂexible in terms of formats of the reference panel and in terms of
the visual output,

0 it runs in ~20 min on a machine with four 2.2GHz cores with a
reference panel including >600 000 SNPs and ~950 individuals,
making it practical to screen samples of an ongoing experiment pro-
gressively as additional data are produced.

We ﬁrst tested bammds through simulations using publicly available
modern and ancient human data. For the WGS data, we used 10 modern
human genomes from HGDP cell lines, published in Meyer et al. (2012),
an Australian aboriginal genome (Rasmussen et al., 2011) and the
Anzick-l genome (Rasmussen et al., 2014). We mapped and processed
the data identically for all genomes (see Supplementary data). We used a

public reference panel that we make available in the Supplementary data,
i.e. HGDP (Li et al., 2008), which includes >600 000 SNPs and ~950
individuals subdivided into 53 populations and 7 geographic regions
(Africa, Eastern-, Western-, Central- and South Asia, Europe, Oceania
and Native America). For each genome, we sampled 3 x 104, 3 x 105,
3 x 106, 1.5 x 107, 3 x 107 and 1.5 x 108 reads (which corresponds to
a depth of coverage around 0.001x, 0.01x, 0.1x, 0.5x, 1x and 5x,
assuming ~100 bp sequence reads). For each sub-sampled genome, we
ran bammds with the HGDP reference panel.

We summarized the simulation results using dimension 1 and 2 only of
the MDS output, as we expect this to be the common usage. For each
population in HGDP, we deﬁned its centroid (or center of gravity) based
on the coordinates of its members for those two dimensions. We then
evaluated the results using two criteria: (i) by assessing which population
was the closest when comparing the position of the WGS sample with the
population centroid, and (ii) by determining if the position of the genome
is within a two-dimensional 99% conﬁdence region. We built the conﬁ-
dence region by assuming that the points follow a bivariate normal dis-
tribution centred around the centroid of the population to which it
belongs (‘population ellipse’).

We present a practical example on how to use the tool to determine
whether a library is heavily contaminated by processing a newly
sequenced ~10 000 year BP old phalange (‘Gus’) from Argentina that
clusters with the Europeans (Supplementary data).

3 RESULTS

The graphical result with all 10 modern individuals at a depth of
0.1x can be seen on Figure 1.

We ﬁnd in the simulations that for all but two cases, we re-
cover the geographic region as the ﬁrst hit for as few as 30 000
reads (~0.001x, Table 1). In the remaining two cases, the
Sardinian and the Karitiana individual, a depth of 0.1x and
0.01x, respectively, is enough. The true nearest population was
also identiﬁed in most cases within the three closest centroids for
a depth above 0.01 (7/10 cases). For the second criteria, we ﬁnd
that in 9/10 of the cases, the WGS sample was within the popu-
lation ellipse at 0.5x and above. Only in one case (San individ-
ual) was a depth of 1x necessary to be placed within the
population ellipse.

For the ancient data, we get similar results for the Aborigine,
which is assigned to the correct geographic region (Oceania) as a
ﬁrst hit with a depth of ~0.001x and above. At a depth higher
than 0.01x, we also recover the expected population as the
closest population. For the Anzick-l individual, presumably be-
cause of increased damage, a depth of 1x is needed to recover
the geographic region as the ﬁrst hit. On the other hand, a Native
American population is among the three closest populations
from a depth of 0.1x and above. The results for Gus are given
in Supplementary data.

4 CONCLUSION

The tool we present in this article is based on classical MDS, a
technique that originated in the 1930s and is commonly used in
other ﬁelds [see, e.g. (Borg and Groenen, 1997) and citations
therein]. We present a tool that was designed to be practical to

assess the ancestry of mapped WGS data for samples sequenced
at low depth, assuming that a relevant reference panel in terms of
ancestry is provided. We show through simulations that useful
ancestry information can be recovered for as few as 30 000
reads—corresponding to a fraction (~1/60 in early 2014) of a
HiSeq 2000 lane (www.illumina.com) for a sample with 1% en-
dogenous content (or ~1/4800 of a lane for a typical modern
sample).

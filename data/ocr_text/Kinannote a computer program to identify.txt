ABSTRACT

Motivation: Kinases of the eukaryotic protein kinase superfamily are
key regulators of most aspects eukaryotic cellular behavior and have
provided several drug targets including kinases dysregulated in
cancers. The rapid increase in the number of genomic sequences
has created an acute need to identify and classify members of this
important class of enzymes efficiently and accurately.

Results: Kinannote produces a draft kinome and comparative ana-
lyses for a predicted proteome using a single line command, and it is
currently the only tool that automatically classifies protein kinases
using the controlled vocabulary of Hanks and Hunter [Hanks and
Hunter (1995)]. A hidden Markov model in combination with a pos-
ition-specific scoring matrix is used by Kinannote to identify kinases,
which are subsequently classified using a BLAST comparison with a
local version of KinBase, the curated protein kinase dataset from
www.kinase.com. Kinannote was tested on the predicted proteomes
from four divergent species. The average sensitivity and precision for
kinome retrieval from the test species are 94.4 and 96.8%. The ability
of Kinannote to classify identified kinases was also evaluated, and the
average sensitivity and precision for full classiﬁcation of conserved
kinases are 71.5 and 82.5%, respectively. Kinannote has had a sig-
niﬁcant impact on eukaryotic genome annotation, providing protein
kinase annotations for 36 genomes made public by the Broad
Institute in the period spanning 2009 to the present.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein kinases are well-studied enzymes involved in the regula-
tion of the majority of eukaryotic cellular processes. Mutations
in protein kinases frequently cause human disease, and kinases
have provided several drug targets (Johnson, 2009). Protein
kinases act by transferring phosphate groups from ATP to the
amino acid side chains of target proteins, a modiﬁcation that
often profoundly alters the biological activity of the target

molecule. There are hundreds of types of protein kinases,
which, despite their common mechanism, act speciﬁcally on di-
verse substrates and are themselves acted on by diverse regula-
tors. The complete set of protein kinases, or kinome, encoded in
an organism’s genome, has a profound impact on the biological
properties of that organism. For example, the advent of the
tyrosine kinase (TK) group, of kinases (protein kinase category
abbreviations are in Supplementary Table Sl) correlates with the
rise of the metazoans (Manning et al., 2008).

It is often possible to infer the function or speciﬁcity of a kinase
discovered in a new organism by comparison with known ex-
amples, as many kinases are well conserved. The task of relating
a new kinase to a known one has been facilitated by work on the
classiﬁcation and evolution of protein kinases (Hanks and
Hunter, 1995; Manning et al., 2002a) and KinBase (www.
kinase.com). These studies show that most protein kinases
belong to the eukaryotic protein kinase (ePK) superfamily,
whose members share a common ancestry and fold. The ePK
superfamily is divided into eight major groups, which are them-
selves divided into families and subfamilies (Supplementary Table
Sl), although not all families fall within one of the major groups.
Most ePKs are recognized by similarity to hidden Markov proﬁles
such as the Pkinase.hmm (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/), but mem-
bers of several families are divergent and are often overlooked in
searches targeted toward typical kinases. Although a core set of
the ePKs is conserved across eukaryotes, this superfamily is plastic
and prone to expansion (Anamika et al., 2008; Artz et al., 2011;
Champion et al., 2004; Eisen et al., 2006; Manning et al., 2008;
Manning, 201 1; Peixoto et al., 2010; Srivastava et al., 2010; Stajich
et al., 2010). The hierarchical structure of the classiﬁcation system
of Hanks, Hunter and Manning is well-suited to handle this plas-
ticity, as it allows partial classiﬁcation of newly discovered kinases
and informatively describes relationships between similar but
non-orthologous kinases.

A much smaller number of protein kinases, designated atypical
protein kinases (aPKs), have either limited similarity to ePKs
(protein kinase-like sequences, or PKLs), or differ from them
altogether, and also differ from each other (Kannan and
Neuwald, 2005; Leonard et al., 1998; Scheeff and Bourne,
2005). Well-conserved aPKs have been annotated in several
curated kinomes (Manning et al., 2002b), and are included in
KinBase (www.kinase.com).

The surge in the availability of genomic data has created a
need to automate identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation of conserved

and novel protein kinases. Current identiﬁcation methods favor
searches against protein kinase hidden Markov models (HMMs)
from Pfam (Punta et al., 2012) or Kinomer (Martin et al., 2009),
and searches against position-speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSMs)
from the Conserved Domain Database (Marchler-Bauer et al.,
2013). These methods effectively identify average kinases but are
often unable to identify novel or divergent superfamily members;
moreover, classiﬁcation based on Pfam and Kinomer HMMs
does not exceed the group level. Sequence similarity searches
against a specialized database (e. g. KinBase) provide more com-
plete classiﬁcation of kinases from families represented in the
database, but results for novel kinases may be difﬁcult to inter-
pret, and the diversity of the ePK superfamily does not lend itself
to application of a universal score threshold. Orthology-based
methods (Li et al., 2003) can provide accurate classiﬁcation, but
their success hinges on the availability of appropriate reference
data. An ortholog must be present and identiﬁed in the reference
genome to make a classiﬁcation in the target genome; thus, non-
orthologous kinases will be overlooked. None of the aforemen-
tioned methods are able to generate an accurate kinome without
manual curation by a knowledgeable user, and therefore are not
Viable solutions to high-throughput kinase annotation.

Here, we present Kinannote, an ePK identiﬁcation and classi-
ﬁcation package that leverages a protein kinase HMM and simi-
larity with known kinases to produce a high-quality draft kinome
for a given gene set with a single command. Kinannote depends
on two readily available third-party programs (BLAST and
HMMER), and its input is a single fasta-formatted ﬁle, which
may contain the complete set of predicted proteins from an
organism, or as few as one sequence. The classiﬁcations pro-
duced by Kinannote are constructed according to the controlled
vocabulary introduced by Hanks and Hunter (1995) and main-
tained at www.kinase.com. This allows information about
related kinases to be directly mapped to newly classiﬁed kinases
from the literature and resources such as ProKinO (Gosal et al.,
2011), the Protein Kinase Resource (Smith et al., 1997), KinG
(Krupa et al., 2004) and PhosphoSite (Hornbeck et al., 2012).
Kinannote generates several ﬁles, including a table of kinases
and their classiﬁcations and phylogenetic proﬁles of discovered
kinases. We show that Kinannote performs well on four refer-
ence kinomes broadly representative of the eukaryotic tree-of-life
(Amphimedon queenslandica, Schizosaccharomyces pombe,
Plasmodium falciparum and Giardia lamblia) and describe its
use to provide kinome annotations for 36 eukaryotic genomes
released by The Broad Institute from 2009 through the time of
publication (www.broadinstitute.org).

2 METHODS
2.1 Algorithm

Kinannote identiﬁes and classiﬁes protein kinases in three phases (Fig. 1);
the ﬁrst phase gathers information about the input sequences and deﬁnes
a candidate set from which most non-kinases have been eliminated; this
phase searches a predicted proteome, or subset thereof, with a protein
kinase HMM and applies a relaxed cutoff that reduces the search space
while retaining divergent kinases. The candidates are searched with a
PSSM and against a local version of KinBase using BLAST, and the
BLAST results are parsed. In phase 2, the BLAST results are used to
identify conserved kinases with poor HMM scores. Once the unusual

combined with the unusual protein kinases identiﬁed in phase 2, and the
new kinome is compared with reference kinomes.

2.1.1 Phase 1: First cut and gathering information Kinannote uses
an HMM derived from a manual alignment of the Dictyostelium
kinome (Goldberg et al. 2006). The Dictyostelium branch-point on the
eukaryotic tree is centrally located (Baldauf, 2003), resulting in a model
sensitive to ePKs from diverse parts of the tree. This HMM is used in a
HMMER search of the input protein set [HMMER 2.3.2 (Eddy, 1998)]
using a relaxed cutoff (HMM E-value for candidate selection, Table 1;
Fig. 1.1), resulting in a reduction of the search space for subsequent steps
by ~95% without loss of divergent kinases. The remaining sequences are
referred to as candidates (Fig. 1b); their scores and alignments to the
HMM are stored for later reference.

Protein kinase domains contain highly conserved substructures
involved in catalysis, substrate binding and magnesium binding (Hanks
and Hunter, 1995; Kannan and Neuwald, 2005). The identities of residues
in catalytic substructures are often more constrained by functional
requirements than by the need, distributed over a larger number of resi-
dues, to stabilize the protein (Fersht, 1985). As substitution matrices used
by common proﬁle-building methods are most inﬂuenced by the effects of
residues on protein stability (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992), proﬁles based
on these methods may underestimate the relative importance of func-
tional residues. To obtain a PSSM more sensitive to kinase subdomain
motifs, we made a HMMER alignment of domains from curated kinases
(www.kinase.com). Most residues observed in this alignment are ‘Viable’,
meaning that they occur in active kinases and are thus given equal weight
in our PSSM.

Positions in the scoring matrix are weighted inversely to the sequence
variability at the corresponding alignment position; therefore, for
example, the position two residues upstream of the catalytic aspartate
is highly weighted and has viable residues H and Y. Residues in candidate
sequences receive scores based on their alignment positions if they contain
viable residues, or scores of zero if they do not contain viable residues.
Positional scores are summed to provide sequence scores, which are
applied in phase 2 of the algorithm. For additional details on the
PSSM, see Supplementary Document S1.

Candidates are searched with BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) against
a local version of selected curated kinomes from KinBase downloaded
on 23 December 2011 (Fig. 1.3). The set of curated kinomes used by
Kinannote is indicated in Supplementary Table S2. The BLAST database
contains both ePKs, for which the sequences of the kinase domains are
used for reference, and aPKs, for which the entire protein sequences are
used; the results of this search are applied later in the algorithm.

2.1.2 Phase 2: Identification
Identification of conserved unusual kinases and some aPKs: Conserved
ePKs with unusual sequences such as SLOB, SCYLl, Bub, Bud32 and

Table 1. Cutoffs used by Kinannote

Haspin tend to score poorly in searches using protein kinase HMMs.
They are identiﬁed at this stage (Fig. 1.4) owing to the presence of similar
kinases in KinBase. Atypical protein kinases were not used to build the
HMM used for the HMMER search; however, several types of PKL
aPKs, notably RIO and ABC], are similar enough to ePKs (Kannan
and Neuwald, 2005; Leonard et al., 1998; Scheeff and Bourne, 2005) to
enter the candidate set and are identiﬁed by similarity to relatives in
KinBase. Unusual protein kinases and aPKs thus identiﬁed are included
in the kinome (Fig. 10).

Identification of typical kinases and twilight hits: Once conserved
unusual kinases and PKL aPKs have been identiﬁed, non-kinases may
be removed from the candidate set without loss of poorly scoring con-
served kinases (Fig. 1.5). Sequences scoring below the PSSM cutoff
(Motif score for twilight hit identiﬁcation, Table 1) are dropped, and
sequences above this cutoff and below the ‘HMM score for kinase iden-
tiﬁcation’ (Table 1) are identiﬁed as twilight hits (Fig. 1d). The remaining
sequences are considered ePKs, added to the kinome (Fig. 1e) and clas-
siﬁed. Twilight hits, designated ‘protein kinase subdomain-containing
proteins’, are not part of the ﬁnal kinome but may provide seed sequences
for delineating novel PKL families.

2.1.3 Phase 3: Classification

Unclassified kinases: To avoid misclassifying potentially novel, divergent
kinases, or kinases with incorrect gene models, Kinannote refrains from
classifying poorly scoring ePKs. Sequences with E-values greater than the
‘BLAST E-value for classiﬁcation’ and scores below the ‘HMM score for
classiﬁcation’ (Table 1) are not classiﬁed. The suggested gene product
name for these sequences is ‘serine/threonine protein kinase’, and they
are ﬂagged in ﬁles produced by Kinannote to facilitate their further cur-
ation. Sequences for which the group level classiﬁcations of the top
BLAST hits are inconsistent (see later in the text) are also not classiﬁed.

Full classification: Kinannote classiﬁes the remaining ePKs into
groups, families and subfamilies (Fig. 1.7) using top BLAST hits. The
algorithm requires that a set number of consecutive top BLAST hits agree
to provide a classiﬁcation (Number of consistent BLAST hits, Table 1);
as there are three levels of classiﬁcation, hits may agree, or not agree, at
the group, family, or subfamily levels. Full classiﬁcations are made if the
top BLAST hits agree at the same classiﬁcation depth as the reference
kinase, which may be classiﬁed either to the group/family level or the
group/family/subfamily level. Kinannote allows the number of consecu-
tive top BLAST hits that are considered in making classiﬁcation decisions
to be set by the user.

Partial classification and uncertainty: Protein kinases discovered in new
genomes often do not ﬁt into existing families or subfamilies but are
evolutionarily related to known groups or families. Kinannote partially
classiﬁes these kinases if possible. If the consecutive top BLAST hits for a
sequence are consistent at the group level, but not at the family level, the
sequence is partially classiﬁed to that group. If the top BLAST hits

against a sequence agree at the group and family level, but not at the
subfamily level, the sequence is classiﬁed to that group and family. Partial
classiﬁcation may also result for kinases with incomplete gene models or
in species that are evolutionarily divergent from those in the reference
database.

TK classification: The TK group is thought to have arisen on the
branch that gave rise to metazoans after divergence from the fungal
branch (Manning et al., 2008); classiﬁcation of earlier-evolving TK
group members thus requires manual veriﬁcation. Kinannote takes a
conservative approach toward TK classiﬁcation in species that are not
metazoans or their close relatives. In non-metazoans, kinases for which
the best BLAST hits against the reference database are TK group mem-
bers are classiﬁed as tyrosine kinase-like (TKL) and ﬂagged in the draft
kinome table produced by Kinannote. Kinannote treats input as non-
metazoan by default; the user must run Kinannote with the ‘-m’ ﬂag in
the command line to classify TK group members normally in metazoans
and their relatives (Supplementary File S1 and online documentation at
sourceforge.net/projects/kinannote).

The union of fully and partially classiﬁed ePKs, unclassiﬁed ePKs,
divergent ePKs and aPKs (Fig. 1 sets g, f, c, respectively) is referred to
as the draft kinome. Kinannote records the draft kinome with its asso-
ciated search scores, labels twilight hits as ‘protein kinase subdomain-
containing proteins’ and ﬂags rejected candidates as ‘subthreshold’.
This ﬁle is used for post-run processing.

2.2 Summary, comparative kinomics, the draft kinome
and gene product names

Kinannote provides extensive metadata and contextual information
about the new draft kinome (Supplementary Table S3). A compact
summary table provides a total kinase count, and counts for the group
and unclassiﬁed categories. If the input is a whole proteome, then the
percentage of kinases in the predicted protein set is given, and a list of
missing core kinases is provided, where the core is determined by presence
in the set of references kinomes from Dictyostelium discoideum,
Saccharomyces cerervisiae, Drosophila melanogaster, Caenorhabdidtis ele-
gans and Homo sapiens. The analyses in this ﬁle allow the completeness of
the kinome to be assessed, which serves as a proxy for the coverage of the
input proteome. A phylogenetic comparison of the new kinome (or
kinome subset) and reference kinomes is provided in a separate table.
The missing core kinases identiﬁed in these tables provide a basis for
hole-ﬁlling and comparative analysis. A list of classiﬁcation-based gene
product names and a summary of the parameters used in the run are also
provided. Kinannote produces a ﬁle containing the parameters that were
used for the latest run. Parameters in this ﬁle may modiﬁed by the user,
and the ﬁle may be renamed, and read using the command line ‘-p’ ﬂag
(Supplementary File S1 and online documentation at sourceforge.net/
projects/kinannote).

Kinannote provides output with details about each identiﬁed kinase
(the draft kinome table), twilight hits and rejected candidates. This table
includes a column indicating the classiﬁcation depth of each kinase: ‘0’ if
the kinase is unclassiﬁed, ‘1’ if it is classiﬁed only to the group level, and
‘2’ or ‘3’ if it is classiﬁed to the family or subfamily levels, respectively.
The classiﬁcation ﬁelds associated with unclassiﬁed kinases remain empty
in this table, but they are identiﬁed as ‘unclassiﬁed’ in another column.
Kinases with classiﬁcation depths of 0 or 1 may be members of novel
families. The classiﬁcation depth number allows potentially novel kinases
and conserved kinases to be separated into two categories, providing a
good foundation for further curation of potentially novel kinases.
Members of PKL expansions contain recognizable kinase motifs but
score poorly against proﬁles built from typical kinases (Leonard et al.,
1998). These sequences are identiﬁed using Kinannote’s PSSM (see
Section 2); they are not included in the draft kinome, but they are labeled
‘protein kinase subdomain-containing proteins’ in the draft kinome table.

In genomes where novel PKL families occur, this list of twilight hits may
provide a starting point for further curation.

Kinannote provides a list of gene product names based on classiﬁca-
tion results. Classiﬁed kinases are named ‘group/family/subfamily protein
kinase’ using the controlled vocabulary maintained at KinBase: the
family and subfamily ﬁelds may be empty, depending on the classiﬁcation
result. Unclassiﬁed kinases are named ‘serine/threonine protein kinase’.

2.3 Test cases

Kinannote was tested on the full sets of predicted proteins from four
species for which curated kinomes are available: A.queenslandica
(Srivastava et al., 2010), Glamblia (Manning et al., 2011), Pfalciparum
(Talevich et al., 2011) and Spombe (Rhind et al., 2011) (Supplementary
Table S2). These species were chosen because they represent different
parts of the eukaryotic tree, their kinomes are comprehensive and well-
classiﬁed using the controlled vocabulary of Hanks and Hunter (1995)
and www.kinase.com, and they are not part of the reference database
used by Kinannote for identiﬁcation or classiﬁcation. The curation levels
of these test kinomes are adequate evaluating kinase prediction and clas-
siﬁcation algorithms, but they are not curated to the level of many of the
kinomes used in the reference database from KinBase, particularly those
of H.sapiens, D.melan0gaster, C.elegans, S.cerevisaie and D.disc0ideum,
for which most kinases received individual attention. In addition, the
fragmentation of the A.queenslandica assembly results in many partial
gene models that are difﬁcult to curate deﬁnitively.

For comparison, tests were performed using protein kinase HMMs
downloaded from the Kinomer resource at www.compbio.dundee.ac.
uk/kinomer (Martin et al., 2009). Reference proteomes were searched
with Kinomer HMMs using the recommended cutoff score of 20, and kin-
ases were classiﬁed according to the group of the best scoring HMM hit.

2.4 Receiver operating characteristic analysis

To evaluate the performance of Kinannote with respect to the curated
datasets using receiver operating characteristic (ROC) analysis (Metz,
2006), it must be determined whether a prediction is a true positive
(TP), true negative, false positive (FP) or false negative (FN). For protein
kinase identiﬁcation, this is straightforward (a sequence either is or is
not an ePK). Similarly, it is easy to determine whether a classiﬁcation
provided by Kinannote exactly matches that of the curated kinase.

Assessing the results for partially classiﬁed kinases is more compli-
cated. If the reference sequence is classiﬁed to the subfamily level, and
Kinannote correctly classiﬁes it to the group and family levels and leaves
the subfamily null, we deﬁne this as TP for partial classiﬁcation and FN
for full classiﬁcation. If Kinannote correctly classiﬁes the group and
leaves both family and subfamily null, this is also counted as TP for
partial and FN for full classiﬁcation, respectively. If Kinannote incor-
rectly assigns the subfamily, we deﬁne this as FP even if the group
and family match the reference because misclassiﬁcation negates correct
partial classiﬁcation in terms of the value of the annotation to a user.
If Kinannote provides no classiﬁcation for a classiﬁed reference kinase,
the partial classiﬁcation result is FN. Finally, if Kinannote and the ref-
erence agree that the sequence is an unclassiﬁed kinase, or is not a kinase,
the partial classiﬁcation is true negative. Similar logic is applied when the
reference kinase is only classiﬁed to the family level. The results of
application of the Kinomer HMMs to test proteomes were similarly
categorized.

For kinase identiﬁcation and classiﬁcation the false-discovery rate is
FDR: FP/(TP + FP), and the true-positive rate (TPR), sensitivity or
recall is TPR 2 TP /(TP + FN), where TP + FN is P, the number of ref-
erence positives. The precision is PPV = TP/(TP + FP), and the F-score is
2*PPV*TPR/(PPV +TPR). A single sequence may have different char-
acteristics, e.g. a TP for identiﬁcation may be an FN for classiﬁcation.

For all ROC analyses, the total number of kinases in the reference set is
used as the value of P.

2.5 Draft kinome production

Supplementary Table S2 includes 36 species for which draft kinome
annotations were produced by Kinannote, or for which curated kinome
annotation was assisted by Kinannote. These kinomes have been incor-
porated into annotations made public by the Broad Institute in the period
from 2009 to the present (www.broadinstitute.org). Most of these anno-
tations are also available at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/).
A cladogram used to illustrate phylogenetic relationships among species
used in this study are based on published phylogenetic analyses (Baldauf,
2003; Desjardins et al., 2013; Duplessis et al., 2011; McLaughlin et al.,
2009; Paps et al., 2013; Rhind et al., 2011; Srivastava et al., 2010; White
et al., 2008).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Optimizing parameters for kinase identiﬁcation

The parameter with the greatest impact on kinase identiﬁcation
is the cutoff score from the search of the input sequences against
the Dictyostelium kinome-based HMM (HMM score for kinase
identiﬁcation, Table 1). This cutoff, applied at Figure 1.5, is
more stringent than initial relaxed cutoff applied at Figure 1.1.
Test runs were produced for ROC analysis (Fig. 2) by varying
the cutoff value from stringent to permissive. The ROC curves
resulting from variation of this parameter allow the optimal
cutoff score to be identiﬁed (Table 1). Similar analyses (not
shown) allowed selection of default values for the other param-
eters affecting kinase identiﬁcation (Table 1).

3.2 Optimizing parameters for kinase classiﬁcation

The parameters with the greatest impact on classiﬁcation are
from the BLAST search of kinase candidates against KinBase
(Fig. 1.3). These parameters, applied at Figure 1.6 and 1.7, re-
spectively, are the E-value of the top hit, and the number of
consistent top hits required for classiﬁcation (BLAST E-value
for classiﬁcation, number of consistent top BLAST hits for clas-
siﬁcation, respectively, Table 1). Test Kinannote runs for ROC
analysis (Fig. 3) were produced with these parameters varied
from stringent to permissive. In general, the TPR is expected
to rise as the FDR falls, but for the ROC curves where the
number of consistent top BLAST hits is varied, the TPR rises,
then falls, as FDR rises. This occurs because kinases that are
correctly placed into families when a greater number of consist-
ent top BLAST hits were required are misclassiﬁed to incorrect
subfamilies when fewer consistent top hits are used. The fall in
TPR as the BLAST cutoff E-value rises in Pfalciparum (Fig. 3D)
results from the presence of unclassiﬁed kinases in the reference
kinome, which are misclassiﬁed at permissive cutoffs.

A striking result apparent in Figure 3 is the better classiﬁcation
obtained using three or four consistent top BLAST hits as a
limiting condition rather than any BLAST E-Value cutoff. This

Fig. 3. ROC analysis to identify optimum settings for classiﬁcation by
Kinannote and compare classiﬁcation methods. Circles: effect on classi-
ﬁcation of varying the number of consistent consecutive top BLAST hits
of candidate kinases against the reference database. The BLAST search is
described in Figure 1.3, and the criterion is applied at Figure 1.7. The
number of consistent hits required for classiﬁcation ranged from 5 (left
side of range) to 1 (right side of range). Partial classiﬁcation is indicated
by half-ﬁlled symbols, and full classiﬁcation is indicated by ﬁlled symbols.
The points obtained at three consistent consecutive hits are indicated with
boxes. This setting was chosen as the default value for Kinannote because
it provides a good compromise between sensitivity and precision.
Diamonds: effect on classiﬁcation of varying the E-value cutoff from
the BLAST search (Fig. 1.6) from 1x 10—100 (left side of range) to 1
(right side of range). As aforementioned, partial and full classiﬁcation
are indicated by half-ﬁlled and ﬁlled symbols, respectively. The test gen-
omes are A, S.pombe; B, A.queenslandica; C, G.lamblia; and D,

is because assignment by top BLAST hits allows classiﬁcation of
loosely afﬁliated families, such as the SRPK family. A BLAST
E-value cutoff relaxed enough to allow classiﬁcation of SRPKs
would result in misclassiﬁcations elsewhere in the kinome. The
reference database must have sufﬁcient depth for classiﬁcation
by number of consistent top BLAST hits to succeed, suggesting
that the performance of Kinannote with respect to classiﬁcation
may be improved by adding breadth and depth to the reference
database.

An important conclusion from the ROC curves for kinase
identiﬁcation (Fig. 2) and classiﬁcation (Fig. 3) is that the
optimal settings are fairly consistent from species to species.
This means that the set of optimal parameters identiﬁed here
(Table 1) and built into Kinannote should give similar results
when the program is applied to divergent species.

3.3 Performance evaluation

With the optimal parameters selected, Kinannote’s performance
on the four curated test genomes may be evaluated. Kinannote
is the only tool currently available that produces a draft kinome
using a single line command. To obtain a measure of comparison
with existing resources, we downloaded the suite of protein
kinase HMMs from Kinomer and used them to identify protein
kinases and classify them to the group level (see Section 2);
comparison of Kinannote and Kinomer is thus restricted to
identiﬁcation and group-level classiﬁcation.

3.3.1 Kinase identification performance Kinannote sensitively
and precisely identiﬁes protein kinases (Fig. 4, compare kinases
identiﬁed by Kinannote in the second columns with the curated
kinomes in ﬁrst columns). Kinannote perfectly retrieves the
S.pombe kinome. Kinannote identiﬁes more kinases than
the Kinomer HMMs in S.pombe, Pfalciparum and G.lamblia
(Fig. 4, compare green regions of the second and ﬁfth columns);
these additional kinases include conserved kinases with unusual
sequences and species-speciﬁc kinases. A case-by-case examin-
ation of false-positive identiﬁcation calls made by Kinannote
indicates that a majority result from FN calls in test kinomes.
Further examination of F P calls is provided in Supplementary
Document S1. Kinomer ﬁnds more kinases in A.queenslandica
than does Kinannote. These additional kinases, many of which
are small fragments, belong to a large TK-expansion in the
sponge; the TK—based HMMs of Kinomer are more sensitive
to divergent members of this group than the HMM used by
Kinannote. Adaptation of these HMMs may improve future
versions of Kinannote.

The sensitivity, precision and the F -score for kinase identiﬁca-
tion and classiﬁcation of the four curated kinomes are given in
Table 2. These values were averaged to provide a summary of the
performance of Kinannote and our application of the Kinomer
HMMs. Overall, Kinannote identiﬁes reference kinases with
an average sensitivities and precisions of 94.4 and 96.8%, re-
spectively. The corresponding values for the Kinomer HMMs
are 91.6 and 96.7%. The average sensitivity of Kinannote is
2.8% greater than that of Kinomer. This results from the ability
of Kinannote to identify BUB, Bud32, Haspin, SCYL and SLOB
kinases, which are widely conserved, but whose sequences di-
verge from those of most kinases. Additional sensitivity results

respectively. Kinomer identiﬁcation and group-level classiﬁcation are
shown in the ﬁfth and sixth columns, respectively. Curated kinase
counts are shown in the ﬁrst columns. For Kinannote and Kinomer,
the columns are divided into TP, FN, FP categories; for the curated
kinomes, the columns are divided into conserved, species-speciﬁc and
unclassiﬁed categories. The colors associated with these categories are
indicated in the key below the ﬁgure. The curated kinomes are from
A, Spombe; B, A.queenslandica; C, G.lamblia; and D, Pfalciparum

vergent kinases.

3.3.2 Kinase classification performance Protein kinases may be
fully or partially classiﬁed into groups, families and subfamilies in
a manner similar to enzyme classiﬁcation by EC number. A full
classiﬁcation exactly matches a category in KinBase, whereas a
partial classiﬁcation matches at the group level, or at the group

and family levels in cases where that family is further divided into
subfamilies. Kinannote effectively fully and partially classiﬁes
more kinases than does our application of the Kinomer HMMs
(Fig. 4A—D, green regions of the third and fourth columns).
Kinannote takes a conservative approach to reﬂect uncertainty
in classiﬁcation, withholding full, and sometimes partial classiﬁ-
cation when the top BLAST hits against the reference database
are inconsistent, or the BLAST E-value of the best hit is above
threshold (Table 1). Such classiﬁcations are considered F Ns for
full or partial classiﬁcation (Fig. 4A—D, yellow regions of the third
and fourth columns); they are included in the kinome, and they are
TPs for kinase identiﬁcation.

A case-by-case examination reveals two causes for the major-
ity of false-positive classiﬁcation calls made by Kinannote: FP
calls against S.pombe are minor, resulting from nomenclature
updates and subfamily additions to the fungal reference kinomes
after curation of the ﬁssion yeast. The other test species are dis-
tantly related to the reference species and have species-speciﬁc
kinase expansions. In some instances, Kinannote classiﬁed spe-
cies-speciﬁc kinases based on the most closely related reference
kinases. Errors of this kind may be ameliorated by extension
of the reference database. Further examination of F P calls is
provided in Supplementary Document S1.

Overall, Kinannote partially classiﬁes the reference kinomes
with average sensitivities and precisions of 76.6 and 84.5%,
respectively (Table 2). The corresponding values for classiﬁcation
of kinases to the group level by application of the Kinomer
HMMs are 79.5 and 53.9%, respectively. The relatively low pre-
cision of partial classiﬁcation by Kinomer (Fig. 4, ﬁfth columns)
is the result of placement of unafﬁliated kinases (kinases from the
‘Other’ group) into one of the major groups. The average

sensitivity and precision values for full classiﬁcation by
Kinannote are 56.8 and 82.5%, respectively. If species-speciﬁc
kinases (cyan blocks in Fig. 4, ﬁrst columns) are excluded from
the calculation, the average sensitivity for full classiﬁcation by
Kinannote rises to 71.5%.

Taken together, these results show that Kinannote identiﬁes
and fully or partially classiﬁes a wide range of protein kinases
with good sensitivity and precision. This, in addition to
Kinannote’s ease of use, fulﬁlls the need for a reliable high-
throughput method for kinome annotation.

3.4 Impact of kinannote on eukaryotic genome annotation

As of early 2013, Kinannote, or a combination of Kinannote and
manual curation, have been used to annotate the kinomes of
36 genomes produced by the Broad Institute (Supplementary
Table S2). An overview of 25 of these new kinomes, representing
a wide spectrum of eukaryotes, is given in Supplementary
Document S1 and Supplementary Figure S1. The accession num-
bers and phylogenetic proﬁles for these kinomes are provided in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5, respectively.

3.5 Future directions

Addition of the test kinomes used for evaluation in this report
to the reference kinomes used by Kinannote will allow better
classiﬁcation of Fungal, Diplomonada, Apicomplexan and
basal metazoan kinases. Inclusion of new kinomes from
Dermatophytes (Martinez et al., 2012) and Apicomplexans
(Miranda-Saavedra et al., 2012; Talevich et al., 2011) and nema-
todes (Desjardins et al., 2013) will provided better depth and
allow classiﬁcation of members of newly described kinase
families present in these clades. Results from recent comparative
genomic studies (Beakes et al., 2012; Cuomo et al., 2012; Neafsey
et al., 2012) may be targeted for kinome curation to provide
better coverage of undersampled eukaryotic groups.

Many aPK families are described by speciﬁc Pfam HMMs; in-
clusion of additional searches with these HMMs will allow most
aPKs to be annotated. The addition of searches against Kinomer
HMMs will improve sensitivity toward TK—group expansions in
metazoans and pre-metazoans. Updated versions of Kinannote
will be available at http://sourceforge.net/projects/kinannote.

We will continue to use Kinannote to provide high-quality
automated kinome annotations for genomes sequenced at the
Broad Institute. We will also use Kinannote to generate data
for in-depth genomic and comparative biological studies, for
the study of protein kinase and signal transduction pathway evo-
lution and to identify potential drug and diagnostic targets in
pathogenic species.

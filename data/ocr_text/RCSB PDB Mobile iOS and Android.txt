ABSTRACT

Summary: The Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics
Protein Data Bank (RCSB PDB) resource provides tools for query,
analysis and visualization of the 3D structures in the PDB archive.
As the mobile Web is starting to surpass desktop and laptop usage,
scientists and educators are beginning to integrate mobile devices into
their research and teaching. In response, we have developed the
RCSB PDB Mobile app for the iOS and Android mobile platforms to
enable fast and convenient access to RCSB PDB data and services.
Using the app, users from the general public to expert researchers can
quickly search and visualize biomolecules, and add personal annota-
tions via the RCSB PDB’s integrated MyPDB service.

Availability and implementation: RCSB PDB Mobile is freely avail-
able from the Apple App Store and Google Play (http://www.rcsb.org).

1 INTRODUCTION

The popularity of mobile computing devices such as smart phones
and tablets ensures that they play signiﬁcant roles in our daily
lives. The CPU speed, memory resources and graphics display
capabilities of these devices have become increasingly powerful
and sophisticated and can support advanced applications whether
at work, home or on the go. An early example of such an app is
the Hematopoietic Expression Viewer (James et al., 2012), which
provides access to microarray gene expression data.

Access to data- and content-rich life science resources such as
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2003) through the
Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB)
PDB Web site (Berman et al., 2000, Rose et al., 2011, 2013)
can, however, prove problematic on tablets, and more so on
hand-held devices, such as smart phones. Even with adaptively
written Web sites that auto-format content for the mobile device

screen dimensions, Web site content can be difﬁcult to navigate
using pinch-to—zoom capability of mobile platforms. As a result,
customized apps have become popular, using mobile operating
system’s platform native widgets and capabilities to provide re-
sponsive and easily navigable information pathways.

Another mobile-speciﬁc challenge involves biomolecular struc-
ture Visualization on mobile platforms such as iOS and Android.
A comprehensive feature comparison of available Viewers is avail-
able (Yiu and Chen, 2014). These platforms do not support Java
Applets such as Jmol (Hanson, 2010), and their CPU capability is
often insufﬁcient to achieve acceptable responsive interactivity
with software-based rendering. One possible work-around would
be the use of WebGL, a mechanism that provides the ability to use
hardware-accelerated 3D rendering through a Web browser; how-
ever, it is not fully supported on all mobile platform browsers.

Following requests from our users, who have iOS and
Android devices, we initiated the development of native clients.

2 METHODS AND FEATURES

Our goal was to produce an intuitive app with the following core cap-
abilities: (i) simple search interface, (ii) quick browsing of search results,
(iii) View of basic data about a structure entry and its PubMed abstract,
(iv) high-performance molecular Visualization and (V) access to the arch-
ive of Molecule 0f the Month educational articles by David Goodsell
(Dutta et al., 2010).

Analysis of RCSB PDB Web site statistics when we initiated develop-
ment efforts showed that iOS access far outstripped Android site Visits.
Moreover, our experience with development tools and API suggested that
iOS would to be a signiﬁcantly more robust system, with fewer device
form factors to support and less operating system fragmentation.
Therefore, iOS was chosen as the ﬁrst development project, followed
by development of the native Android app.

Development environments for the iOS version of the app used Xcode
5 and version iOS 7. Development of the Android app version used
Eclipse and the Google Android Development Kit (ADK) Eclipse
plug-in, together with the Java SDK.

2.1 Workﬂow

The Visual design and workﬁow of the application are the same for both
the iOS and the Android versions. The home screen (Fig. 1) provides the
entry point to six options for biomacromolecular exploration.

2.2 Data access

Data access classes use the published RESTful Web services (Rose et al.,
2011), with the exception of the weekly update of the internal index and
MyPDB interactions.

A key feature of the app, the ability to quickly display search data with
minimal network bandwidth overhead, was achieved in part with a min-
imal SQLlite—formatted internal index of PDB data on the mobile device.
With this approach, queries to our RESTful Web services need only
return a list of PDB IDs, thereby enhancing speed and reducing band-
width requirements, an important attribute when using the app on a
cellular connection. To support this functionality, the index is synchro-
nized weekly with new data releases.

The PubMed Abstract screen is displayed after selecting an entry in a
results listing. It also provides a pathway to viewing the entry in the
included molecular viewer. Encapsulating data within the thumbnail
images used in results listings mitigate the impact of multiple data re-
quests to the server and resultant network latency. When the user selects
an entry in a results listing, PDB entry metadata is extracted from the
‘Description’ EXIF ﬁeld of the J PEG-formatted thumbnail image. That
textual content is then injected by the application into the Web page
template via J ava—Script. The internal index provides basic information
and the ﬁrst author of a structure entry (Fig. 1). Data included in the
thumbnail comprise the PubMed abstract (where available), the full
author list and other entry metadata.

2.3 MyPDB and Molecule of the Month

The RCSB PDB MyPDB service enables users to save queries, rerun
queries on a regular basis, receive alerts of new query matches, tag entries
of interest and add personal annotations to entries.

The News and Molecule of the Month (Fig. 2) screens are Web views in
the iOS and Android APIs that connect to minimal Web pages on the
RCSB PDB Web server. For the news page, external links are trapped
and opened either in a new modal screen (iOS) or in the default Web
browser (Android). Links to example PDB structures in Molecule of the
Month articles are trapped; clicking on the PDB ID will display that
entry’s search result listing.

2.4 Molecular viewer

The app molecular viewer (Fig. 2) is based on an open-source molecular
viewer NDKmol (http://webglmol.sourceforge.jp). NDKmol is optimized

for rendering performance and efﬁcient memory usage on mobile plat-
forms using the graphics processing unit (GPU) and can handle large
structures like ribosomes and viruses without difﬁculty. It supports
most of the common molecular representations, such as ball-and-stick
and cartoons, and coloring (by atom, by chain, by B factor, etc.).

One of the unique features of NDKmol is the fast rendering of biolo-
gical assemblies and crystal packing. The viewer stores atomic coordin-
ates and generates polygons for only one copy of the subunits. Symmetry
mates are generated on the mobile device’s GPU by multiplying
OpenGL’s model-view matrix with symmetry operators.

3 CONCLUSION

The iOS and Android clients described provide fast low-
bandwidth access to data and services provided by the RCSB
PDB.

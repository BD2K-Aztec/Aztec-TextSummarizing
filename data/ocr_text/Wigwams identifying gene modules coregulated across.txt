ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of modules of co-regulated genes is a cru-
cial first step towards dissecting the regulatory circuitry underlying
biological processes. Co-regulated genes are likely to reveal them-
selves by showing tight co-expression, e.g. high correlation of expres-
sion profiles across multiple time series datasets. However, numbers
of up- or downregulated genes are often large, making it difficult to
discriminate between dependent co-expression resulting from co-
regulation and independent co-expression. Furthermore, modules of
co-regulated genes may only show tight co-expression across a
subset of the time series, i.e. show condition-dependent regulation.
Results: Wigwams is a simple and efficient method to identify gene
modules showing evidence for co-regulation in multiple time series of
gene expression data. Wigwams analyzes similarities of gene expres-
sion patterns within each time series (condition) and directly tests the
dependence or independence of these across different conditions. The
expression pattern of each gene in each subset of conditions is tested
statistically as a potential signature of a condition-dependent regulatory
mechanism regulating multiple genes. Wigwams does not require par-
ticular time points and can process datasets that are on different time
scales. Differential expression relative to control conditions can be
taken into account. The output is succinct and non-redundant, enabling
gene network reconstruction to be focused on those gene modules
and combinations of conditions that show evidence for shared regula-
tory mechanisms. Wigwams was run using six Arabidopsis time series
expression datasets, producing a set of biologically significant modules
spanning different combinations of conditions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Elucidating the regulatory mechanisms mediating biological pro-
cesses is a key challenge in many eukaryotic organisms. Much
regulation occurs at the transcriptional level; however, despite
our ability to profile genome-wide gene expression and the avail-
ability of bioinformatics tools to analyze sequence information,
our understanding of gene regulatory networks underlying bio-
logical processes is still relatively basic. Regulatory interactions
are often common, meaning that the ability to understand the
regulation of a response requires a mathematical or computa-
tional network model. Underlying these network models is the
knowledge of regulatory mechanisms. Techniques to identify
regulatory mechanisms, such as genome-wide chromatin immu-
noprecipitation sequencing (Robertson et al., 2007) and matrix-
based yeast one-hybrid (YlH) (Deplancke et al., 2006), have
improved, but these techniques are not high-throughput.
Therefore, it is crucial to be able to make high-quality predic-
tions of regulatory mechanisms using existing data; these predic-
tions can then be tested in focused experimental and modelling
efforts.

Time series experiments are often used to examine the dy-
namics of gene expression (Belling et al., 2013; Windram et al.,
2012), and with the decreasing cost of profiling techniques, more
datasets covering multiple time series showing how an organism
responds to different conditions are becoming available. Such
data offer the opportunity to study shared regulatory mechan-
isms that are used to regulate genes under more than one con-
dition. Such shared regulatory mechanisms may drive gene
expression in the same way in each time series, or they may be
modiﬁed to drive expression on a different time scale or to
change the direction of regulation (activation versus repression).
To facilitate gene network reconstruction, it is important to
develop tools that can map out which gene modules are co-
regulated in what combinations of conditions.

It is a long-standing assumption that co-expression may reﬂect
co-regulation (Altman and Raychaudhuri, 2001), and using data
from multiple conditions can improve the correlation between
the two (Yeung et al., 2004). However, in noisy biological sys-
tems, co-regulated genes may still show some differences in their
expression, and there may be more than one regulatory mechan-
ism that can drive genes with a particular expression pattern.
Following a perturbation, such as infection or treatment with a
chemical stimulus, many genes change in expression and even
with high-resolution time series, large numbers of genes can

Identification of co-regulated gene modules

 

show a similar expression proﬁle (VVeinstock-Guttman et al.,
2003; Windram et al., 2012). As a result, it can be challenging
to distinguish between dependent co-expression indicative of co-
regulation and independent co-expression of genes that achieve a
similar expression pattern in different ways. It is important to
note that both dependent and independent co-expression may
pass statistical tests that are geared towards testing the similarity
of expression patterns and/or the tightness of a gene cluster rela-
tive to other clusters. Therefore, tools that solely aim to detect
clusters of similarly expressed genes may not discriminate
informative dependent co-expression from uninformative inde-
pendent co-expression.

Multiple high-resolution time series of gene expression for a
single organism under different conditions provide a powerful
approach for identifying dependent co-expression of genes
likely to be controlled by a common upstream regulator.
However, while an increasing number of time series would help
to improve the speciﬁcity of co-expression (i.e. co-expression
across more time series is more likely to be dependent co-
expression), it is unlikely that a single group of genes will be
co-expressed across all the datasets. For example, it is known
that there is signiﬁcant cross-talk between signalling networks for
different plant hormones in Arabidopsis, but not all of the com-
ponents are playing a role in the response to every hormone
(Robert-Seilaniantz et al., 2011). Furthermore, some of the
detected co-expression across multiple datasets may still be inde-
pendent co-expression due to the abundance of particular expres-
sion proﬁles rather than due to a shared regulatory mechanism.
Hence, there is a need for an algorithm that can identify modules
of genes dependently co-expressed across subsets of time series
data, combining the increased speciﬁcity of multiple time series
datasets with biological reality.

A myriad of clustering algorithms have been developed to
assign genes into clusters based on the similarity of their expres-
sion proﬁles across a single time series or multiple static (i.e.
single or few time points) datasets (Madeira et al., 2010; Maere
et al., 2008; Meng et al., 2009; Reiss et al., 2006). A few algo-
rithms have also been developed to speciﬁcally cluster genes
using two or more time series datasets, such as BHC (Savage
et al., 2009) and SplineCluster (Heard et al., 2005). However,
these algorithms partition genes into clusters and do not enable
identiﬁcation of genes co-expressed across subsets of the data.
A few methods are capable of identifying co-expression across
subsets of the data, but these come with their own drawbacks.
Tensor methods (Li et al., 2012; Zhang et al., 2012) require the
timescale of the experiments to be uniform throughout. EDISA
(Supper et al., 2007) does not require the same timescale across
all of the datasets, but it is non-deterministic. None of these
methods is able to incorporate differential expression relative
to control time series into the analysis, and crucially, none stat-
istically evaluates dependent co-expression versus independent
co-expression. ENIGMA (Maere et al., 2008) can account for
genes’ differential expression, but the method was designed for a
series of static expression data. CCC-Biclustering (Madeira et al.,
2010) tests biclusters for statistical signiﬁcance against a null
hypothesis of independent expression proﬁle evolution, but the
method is only capable of analyzing a single time course
experiment.

Wigwams (Wigwams identifies genes working across multiple
situations) is a simple, deterministic and efﬁcient method capable
of identifying groups of dependently co-expressed genes, termed
gene modules, spanning subsets of the available time series
datasets. Wigwams is a comprehensive method; all potential
dataset combinations are scanned for gene modules by rigorously
testing putative gene modules around each gene differentially
expressed in a dataset. Wigwams evaluates each putative
module for statistical signiﬁcance and provides a non-redundant
output of gene modules showing signiﬁcant co-expression across
varying combinations of the time series data. Each gene may be
assigned to one or more gene modules or to no module at all.
Wigwams requires little user input (further aided by easy-to—use
graphical user interfaces) and is computationally inexpensive
and relatively fast, making it a useful method to analyze mul-
tiple time series experiments for evidence of co-regulation. We
demonstrate that gene modules identiﬁed by Wigwams are
often enriched for Gene Ontology (GO) terms (Ashburner
et al., 2000) and known transcription factor (TF) binding
motifs indicating biological relevance. We also provide experi-
mental evidence of potential co-regulation. Wigwams is a power-
ful tool to utilize the resolution of time series expression data in a
statistically rigorous approach for identiﬁcation of co-regulated
gene modules. It can make a direct contribution to gene regula-
tory network analysis and computational prediction of regula-
tory mechanisms.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

Here we outline the Wigwams algorithm indicating the various steps and
decisions to be taken in applying this method to multiple time series
expression datasets. A Matlab implementation is provided at warwick.-
ac.uk/wigwams along with relevant documentation.

2.1 Input

The input to Wigwams is a matrix of gene expression values for all
the time series data to be analyzed with unique gene identiﬁers and
annotation of each time series sample. Two additional matrices can be
provided to improve the biological relevance and ease of interpretation
of resulting modules: one indicating which genes are differentially ex-
pressed (DE) in each time series dataset (previously determined rela-
tive to a control time series) in a binary manner (0 for non-DE, 1 for
DE), and the second providing annotation information for each unique
gene identiﬁer. If data on DE genes are not provided, then all genes are
treated equally. A graphical user interface has been created to aid in the
construction of data formats for use in Wigwams based on raw input
ﬁles. A second graphical user interface facilitates running the individual
steps of the Wigwams method described in Sections 2.2, 2.3 and 2.4
below.

The expression proﬁles are standardized on a per-gene basis in each
dataset, and a matrix containing the expression proﬁles of all genes dif-
ferentially expressed in at least one of the conditions is created. The ex-
pression proﬁles of non-DE genes within each condition are randomly
shufﬂed across non-DE genes. This prevents non-DE genes from contri-
buting to gene modules, as it unlinks dependencies of expression proﬁles
across conditions for those genes (see Section 2.2 below). Any non-DE
gene making a (coincidental) contribution to a gene module is removed
from the module (see below). Therefore, although the randomization step
eases the data processing, it has no effect on the eventual output of
Wigwams, leaving the Wigwams output deterministic.

2.2 Identifying modules spanning multiple datasets

This stage of Wigwams is outlined in Supplementary Figure S1, with an
example shown in Figure 1. The aim of these steps is to detect all evidence of
co-regulation (in the form of dependent co-expression) across the multiple
time series datasets, regardless of the redundancy of resulting modules. Each
gene that is DB in two or more conditions is deemed a ‘seed’ gene and is
tested sequentially. For each condition in which the seed gene is DE, the
other genes in the expression matrix are ranked on the basis of how well their
expression proﬁle in that time series is correlated with the expression proﬁle
of the seed gene. Genes are ranked with the most correlated gene at the top of
the list. In the work presented in this article, the Pearson correlation
coefﬁcient was used as the similarity measure. Alternative metrics could
be substituted without a need to change the Wigwams method itself.

For each combination of conditions in which the seed gene is DE, the
size of the overlap between the top-ranked co-expressed genes in each
dataset is tested statistically (Fig. 1 shows an example). This evaluates
whether the similarities of gene expression observed within each time
series are dependent across datasets. A signiﬁcant P-value suggests that
a regulatory mechanism is at work that (i) targets a signiﬁcantly similar
set of genes in each condition considered and (ii) induces expression pro-
ﬁle similarity in each condition. However, no restriction is made regard-
ing the similarity of gene expression proﬁles across different conditions.
Therefore, a regulatory mechanism that targets a similar set of genes
under different conditions, but with a different effect on expression

Fig. 1. Strong evidence for dependent co-expression is detected during
the module identiﬁcation stage. (A) and (B) are two lists of 50 genes that
are most correlated to the seed gene’s expression proﬁle in B.cinerea in-
fection and senescence, respectively (seed gene shown in red). (C) The
overlap between the two lists (genes shown in green) is determined, and
the expression proﬁles of the identiﬁed genes are shown in (D). To evalu-
ate whether the observed overlap is likely to have occurred by chance a
hypergeometric test is performed (yielding a P-value below 1e-17 in this
example). Overlaps deemed statistically signiﬁcant are likely to discrim-
inate dependently co-expressed genes from independently co-expressed
genes. Such overlaps are therefore termed ‘modules’. In this example,
the module is ‘spanning’ B.cinerea infection and senescence. Hpi, hours
post inoculation; das, days after sowing, h, hours

(e.g. activating in one condition but repressing in another) can still be
detected by this statistical test.

All possible combinations of conditions are tested (i.e. sets of two or
more time series up to the number of independent time series used), using
the top n most correlated genes in each dataset, where the user speciﬁes a
range of values for n. In our work, we have used n = 50, 100, 150, 200 and
250 to be able to detect regulatory mechanisms targeting <10 to >100
genes. Wigwams processes the detection of modules (described in this
Section) independently for each n and pools the results.

To determine whether the observed overlap is statistically signiﬁcant,
the hypergeometric test is used. For the purposes of the Matlab imple-
mentation of Wigwams, the hypergeometric test function by Meng et al.
(2009) was used. This was modiﬁed to enable the signiﬁcance of overlaps
between more than two time series to be assessed. Given a universe of size
U and two sets of size N2 = [n1,n2], the probability of observing an
overlap of at least size x by chance equals

min(N2)
 : ((:1>(Z;.":>>/(£:>

One can expand this for k sets of size Nk 2 [n1, n2, ..., nk_1, nk] by assum-
ing the probability of observing an overlap of at least size x between the
k sets to be equal to the sum of the products of the probability of obser-
ving an overlap of exactly size i between k — 1 sets of size
Nk_1 2 [n1, n2, ..., nk_2, nk_1] and the probability of observing an overlap
at least of size x between two sets of size [i,nk], for x 5 i 5 min(Nk_1).
Owing to the nature of the hypergeometric test, the probability of obser-
ving an overlap of exactly size i between k — 1 sets is equal to the differ-
ence of the probability of observing an overlap at least of size i and the
probability of observing an overlap of at least size i+ 1 for
i< min(Nk_1), and to Hk_1(Nk_1, min(Nk_1), U) for i: min(Nk_1).
Combining that into a formula yields

Hk(Nk,X, U) = Hk—1(Nk—1, min(Nk—1)s U) ' H2([min(Nk—1), nkas U)
min(Nk_1)—l
+ Z [(Hk_1<Nk_1,i, U) — Hk_1(Nk_1,z-+1,U))-H2<[i,nk1,x,U)1

This modiﬁcation makes it possible to evaluate the statistical signiﬁ-
cance of overlaps between three and more time series datasets.

The Bonferroni correction (Bland and Altman, 1995) is applied to the
P-values from the hypergeometric test. Given a desired signiﬁcance
threshold or (0.05 was used for this study), the Bonferroni correction
proposes an adjusted or

acorr = (Dz/2:1  _ ni _ 

where n,- is the number of datasets in which gene i is differentially expressed.
N is the number of genes. Overlaps with a P-value below the adjusted
signiﬁcance threshold were deemed to have statistically signiﬁcant depend-
ent co-expression. Such overlap gene lists are considered gene modules and
always include the seed gene by design. If any non-DE genes are included in
these overlaps, these are removed from the putative gene modules before
evaluating the statistical signiﬁcance. Therefore, the output is a list of gene
modules showing statistically signiﬁcant dependent co-expression across
two or more time series datasets. However, at this stage multiple modules
may contain similar genes as if seed genes have similar expression proﬁles,
similar gene modules will be created around these.

2.3 Merging similar modules spanning the same time
series subset

This process in Wigwams is outlined in Supplementary Figure S2, with an

example shown in Figure 2. It is important that the output of Wigwams is

in a useful format for biologists to use, and hence at this stage of the

algorithm, gene modules with a sizeable overlap of gene membership are

Fig. 2. Merging. The modules shown in (A and B) span the same com-
bination of conditions (depicted in blue; other time series shown in black),
and feature a sizeable overlap in gene membership. Merging joins the two
modules into a combined module shown in (C). The mean expression
proﬁles of the larger module A are used to determine whether the ﬁve
genes unique to module B are expressed with sufﬁcient similarity to be
included in the joint module, preserving the extra information that is
contributed by module B. In this example, all genes of module B are
accepted. Hpi, hours post-inoculation; das, days after sowing, h, hours

merged. However, this stage only reduces redundancy among modules
that are spanning the same combination of conditions.

Owing to the way modules are formed in Wigwams, modules with
large overlap will also have similar expression proﬁles. In this study,
modules with an overlap >30% of the smaller module’s gene membership
are merged. This simpliﬁes the output because one module, containing
genes co-expressed with similar proﬁles, is formed rather than two. The
choice of overlap threshold was based on the distribution of overlap size
(as a proportion of the smaller module) as seen in Supplementary Figure
S1. The distribution of overlap size can be plotted within Wigwams
providing a tool for the user to set this threshold. Genes from the smaller
module are added to the larger module provided that their expression
proﬁle is sufﬁciently correlated with the mean expression proﬁle of the
larger module. We used a correlation threshold of 0.8, which needed to be
fulﬁlled for each of the datasets the modules span. In addition, two mod-
ules whose mean expression proﬁles across relevant time series datasets
are highly correlated (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of at least 0.9 for
each of the datasets) are also merged, regardless of the overlap in
gene membership. The merging stage produces a set of modules with

greatly reduced redundancy but without loss of essential information
(see Table 1). Broader regulatory phenomena are reconstructed using
previously identiﬁed statistically signiﬁcant modules. The user can
adjust the thresholds to shift the trade-off between the ability to see
subtle differences between similar modules and the ability to get a suc-
cinct overview of key signals in the data.

2.4 Sweeping redundant modules spanning different
dataset subsets

This stage of Wigwams is outlined in Supplementary Figure S3, with an
example shown in Figure 3. Sweeping addresses a second kind of redun-
dancy. For example, in the case of a module containing genes signiﬁ-
cantly co-expressed across three conditions, signiﬁcant dependent co-
expression is likely to be picked up for each pair of these time series as
well, yielding another three modules. The gene membership of the module
spanning more conditions is compared with that of modules spanning
subsets of these time series. If the overlap is comparable with the size of
the module spanning fewer conditions, then this module is discarded on
the basis of it not contributing signiﬁcant new information. In this study,
the module spanning fewer conditions was discarded if the overlap fea-
tured at least 50% of its gene members.

The output at this ﬁnal stage of Wigwams is a list of modules gener-
ated from genes showing statistically signiﬁcant dependent co-expression,
processed to optimize the number of different expression patterns con-
tained in these modules and reduce redundancy between module gene

GO term (Ashburner et al., 2000) enrichment was tested with the
Cytoscape plugin BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005) using the GO_Full ontol-
ogy with the hypergeometric test and the Benjamini—Hochberg correction
to control the false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). The
whole genome Arabidopsis annotation was used as a reference set.
Analysis of overrepresented TF binding motifs in module promoter se-
quences was carried out exactly as in Breeze et al. (2011), using informa-
tion from the PLACE (Higo et al., 1999) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al.,

2006) databases. P—values were adjusted using the Benjamini—Hochberg
correction. For each gene, 500 bp of DNA upstream of the transcriptional
start site was tested. As a control for GO term and TF binding motif
analysis, 78 groups of genes were randomly generated from the 16686
genes forming the Wigwams input. These 78 random modules were the
same size as the 78 ﬁnal modules identiﬁed by Wigwams.

2.6 Yeast one-hybrid technique

The yeast one-hybrid TF library screen was performed as described in
Hickman et al. (2013) using three overlapping promoter fragments
of ~400 bp spanning ~1kb upstream of the transcription start site of
each gene.

3 RESULTS

We applied Wigwams to analyze a set of six time series datasets
of gene expression responses to environmental stress in the

model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. Two of the datasets were
high-resolution time series, one obtained from leaves following
infection with the fungus Botrytis cinerea (W indram et al., 2012),
the other from leaves developing from maturity to senescence
(ageing) (Breeze et al., 2011). The other four datasets had
fewer time points, and captured responses to abiotic stresses
[shoot and roots after cold stress, roots during drought and
shoots after ultraviolet (UV) light exposure]. These were ob-
tained from AtGenExpress (Kilian et al., 2007). The two
groups of experiments were performed with different microarray
platforms (Redman et al., 2004; Sclep et al., 2007), and the
datasets were found to have 19 886 genes in common.

For the B.cinerea infection and senescence time series, the
curated lists of DE genes were used (Breeze et al., 2011;
Windram et al., 2012). For the AtGenExpress datasets, differen-
tial gene expression was determined using the GPTwoSample test
(Stegle et al., 2010), with a score threshold of four. In all, 16 686
genes were DE over time in at least one condition
(Supplementary Dataset S1), with 12447 genes DE in at least
two conditions and hence eligible for inclusion into Wigwams
modules.

3.1 Wigwams systematically scans the data for
evidence of co-regulation

The module identiﬁcation procedure uses one gene at a time
(‘seed gene’) and each combination of conditions in turn and
tests whether the expression pattern of the seed gene across
these time series may be driven by a regulatory mechanism
acting on a number of genes under more than one condition.
This is illustrated in Figure 1 for the case of a set of two condi-
tions. For each time series, gene expression similarity to the seed
gene is evaluated and the list of genes that are most strongly
correlated with the seed gene assembled. Genes in each list
show co-expression (across multiple conditions), which could
be dependent co-expression driven by a common mechanism,
or independent co-expression where multiple mechanisms
induce similar expression patterns. If the expression similarity
observed in each time series is the result of a common regulatory
mechanism, then it is likely that this mechanism will target a
similar set of genes in each condition. Wigwams tests this hy-
pothesis. In the example of Figure 1, of 50 genes in each list, 11
genes (plus the seed gene) are in common between the two lists.
By the hypergeometric test, the likelihood of making this obser-
vation by chance is below 1e—17. This provides strong evidence
that the co-expression observed is not independent co-expression,
but dependent co-expression driven by a shared regulatory mech-
anism. Hence, the 11 genes in the overlap (plus the seed gene) are
likely to be under a common regulatory inﬂuence and are con-
sidered a module.

The module identiﬁcation procedure was run for all DE genes
and all dataset combinations. This stage of the analysis took 2h
53 min on a Dell Precision M4700 computer (2.8 GHz Intel Core
i7-3840QM processor, 16 GB DDR3 SDRAM at 1600 MHz,
64-bit Windows 7 Professional, Matlab R2012b), producing a
list of 4434 statistically signiﬁcant gene modules likely to be
showing dependent co-expression spanning two to six conditions
(Table 1). Of the 12447 DE genes in two or more conditions,
4444 were placed in at least one module.

Identification of co-regulated gene modules

 

3.2 Wigwams effectively removes redundancy among
modules

As Wigwams considers every DE gene as a seed gene during the
module identiﬁcation stage, the method is comprehensive, but
the output after the ﬁrst stage is likely to have a high degree of
redundancy. The merging algorithm merges modules with similar
gene membership and/or highly similar expression proﬁles
(exempliﬁed in Fig. 2). The sweeping algorithm removes modules
that have a large overlap with another module, but only show
dependent co-expression across a smaller subset of conditions
(exempliﬁed in Fig. 3). In both cases, the essential information
characterizing the expression phenomenon observed is main-
tained, while redundant information is removed.

After the merging stage, the initial 4434 modules were con-
densed into 161 modules (Table 1), while the number of unique
genes assigned to at least one module only decreased from 4444
to 4239. The genes lost during merging had expression proﬁles
not sufﬁciently similar to the mean expression proﬁle of the
larger module to be included. The average size of modules
increased from 22 to 56 genes, while overlaps among modules
were strongly reduced. Redundancy within the remaining 161
modules was further reduced by the sweeping stage. This reduced
the list to 128 modules with an average size of 63, while the
number of unique genes included in modules decreased only
slightly from 4239 to 4197.

We decided to exclude small modules from further analyses, as
(i) we wanted to get an overview of expression signatures driven
by major regulatory mechanisms and (ii) although the excluded
modules did pass rigorous statistical testing, the evidence base
for these modules is not as wide as for the larger ones. We
required a minimum of 10 genes for modules spanning two or
three conditions, a minimum of 8 if spanning four, and a
minimum of 5 genes if spanning ﬁve or six time series. These
thresholds were simply chosen on the basis that fewer genes will
be co-expressed across a larger number of datasets and small
modules will provide little functional information. Our thresh-
olding resulted in a ﬁnal list featuring 78 modules spanning two
to ﬁve conditions and covering 4194 unique genes (Table l and
Supplementary Dataset S2).The mean module size is 100 genes.

3.3 Wigwams reveals expression signatures of regulatory
mechanisms

Four modules from the set of 78 are shown in Figure 4 (expres-
sion proﬁles for all modules are in Supplementary Dataset S3).
Strong evidence for dependent co-expression has been detected
for time series coloured in blue. The evidence for co-regulation of
genes in these modules does not merely stem from the tightness
of expression patterns, but is further supported by the depend-
ence of expression similarities across time series. Although some
expression proﬁles appear correlated in conditions not part of
the module (e.g. shoot cold in Fig. 4D), we have not found evi-
dence for dependence of co-expression in these time series.
Expression similarity arises from a large number of genes sharing
a similar proﬁle in that condition.

Interestingly, module A shows regulation in different direc-
tions depending on conditions. During B.cinerea infection,
senescence and root response to cold genes in the module are
upregulated, while they are downregulated during root response

to drought and shoot response to UV, consistent with the idea
that the mechanism regulating these genes operates in a different
mode under different conditions.

The full set of 78 modules contains modules dependently co-
expressed across different combinations of conditions (Fig. 5 and
Table l). The modules detected by Wigwams can be considered
the result of regulatory networks active during different stress
responses. By analyzing the distribution and function of modules
across different combinations of conditions, hypotheses can be
made about the function and complexity of the networks under-
lying these, and network reconstruction attempts can be directed
towards suitable time series combinations. For example, a re-
searcher interested in unravelling shared regulatory networks be-
tween the biotic stress of B.cinerea infection and abiotic stress
can see from Figure 5 that only one module spans B.cinerea
infection, root response to drought and shoot response to cold.
As such, attempts to reconstruct a common regulatory network
spanning these three stress responses do not appear to be well
supported by the available data, as we see little evidence for a
complex shared network. In contrast, there are nine modules
spanning B.cinerea infection, root response to cold and shoot
response to UV light, making this combination of stresses
much more promising for elucidating a common regulatory net-
work. Wigwams allows the researcher to rigorously examine
available data for evidence of a regulatory network before em-
barking on modelling or experimental efforts.

3.4 Biological validation of detected modules

The enrichment of genes involved in the same biological process
is often used as an indication of co-regulation of a gene module.
Therefore, we tested Wigwams modules using BiNGO (Maere
et al., 2005) and found that 71 of the 78 gene modules were
overrepresented for GO terms (Ashburner et al., 2000) relating
to biological processes Vis-a-Vis 24 of the 78 random modules.
This further supports the case for co-regulation of genes in each
Wigwams module. Two examples of such modules, along with
the identiﬁed overrepresented GO terms, are shown in Figure 6
(overrepresented GO terms for all modules are given in
Supplementary Dataset S4).

The module shown in Figure 6A features 29 genes spanning
four datasets and is enriched in GO terms ‘response to abscisic
acid (ABA)’ and ‘response to cold’. This suggests a wider role of
genes responding to cold and a role of ABA, a plant hormone, in
mediating the link between the four conditions. The module
shown in Figure 6B contains 269 genes dependently co-expressed
across shoot response to cold and UV light, and is enriched in
GO terms corresponding to the CUL4 RING ubiquitin ligase
complex and non-coding RNA processing. The enrichment of
genes with a shared function (members of the same complex)
suggests that a speciﬁc mechanism acts to co-ordinate expression
of the genes in this module.

Transcriptional gene regulation occurs by the binding of TFs
to speciﬁc DNA sequences in promoters of genes. The same or
similar TF binding motifs are often present in the promoters of
co-regulated genes. We tested the Wigwams modules for enrich-
ment of known TF binding motifs and found that 51 of the 78
modules had at least one overrepresented motif (Supplementary
Dataset S5), suggesting that the module members were

by small circles. Evidence for dependent co-expression was found across a
range of combinations of conditions, ranging from two time series up to
ﬁve time series. By analyzing the number of modules detected for differ-
ent combinations of conditions, network reconstruction efforts can be
focused on time series combinations showing evidence for shared regula-
tory mechanisms. The nine modules featuring B.cinerea infection, root
response to cold and shoot response to UV light are shaded light grey.
The single module spanning B.cinerea infection, root response to drought
and shoot response to cold is shaded dark grey

co-regulated. In comparison, 6 of the 78 random modules were
overrepresented for a motif. The promoters of genes in the
module shown in Figure 6A were overrepresented for the W
box (de Pater et al., 1996), suggesting that the dependent co-
expression is driven by binding of TFs from the WRKY TF
family (Eulgem et al., 2000), known to play a key role in regulat-
ing plant stress responses (Chen et al., 2012; Eulgem and
Somssich, 2007). The module shown in Figure 6B was strongly
enriched in a motif bound by the TCP TF family (Cubas et al.,
1999; Welchen and Gonzalez, 2006), again suggesting a mechan-
ism for shared regulation.

Finally, we tested the validity of the Wigwams modules using
the YlH technique to test for direct binding of the same TF(s) to
multiple genes within a module. As we are interested in gene
regulatory networks, we targeted TF gene promoters from
Wigwams modules. The promoters of two genes (At3g15210
and At5g05410) from a 26-gene module spanning B.cinerea in-
fection and root and shoot responses to cold (Supplementary
Fig. S4a) were screened against a TF library to identify TFs
able to bind these DNA sequences. Both of these promoters
were bound by TCP3 (Atlg53230) and TCPl (Atlg67260), two
members of the TCP TF family (Martin-Trillo and Cubas, 2010).
In a 38-gene module spanning senescence and the root response
to drought (Supplementary Fig. S4b), the promoters of three
genes (Atlgl9l80, Atlg80840 and At3g23250) were screened
and were bound by WRKY4l, a member of the WRKY TF

family (Eulgem et al., 2000). Direct binding of these TFs to mul-
tiple gene promoters from the same module is a strong indication
that the Wigwams algorithm is detecting dependent co-expres-
sion reﬂecting co-regulation.

4 DISCUSSION

Wigwams is a simple deterministic method capable of identifying
groups of genes exhibiting statistically signiﬁcant dependent co-
expression across subsets of time series datasets, and using that
information to construct larger non-redundant modules captur-
ing broader transcriptional phenomena. Its comprehensive
nature minimizes the odds of missing evidence of co-regulation,
and the redundancy removal procedures provide the researcher
with a succinct biologically informative output. In some cases,
when examining the expression plots of gene modules, the
module appears to exhibit co-expression in conditions that are
not deemed signiﬁcant. This demonstrates the power of
Wigwams to select modules with statistically signiﬁcant depend-
ent co-expression. In these non-signiﬁcant conditions, the given
expression proﬁle may have been abundant and/or the module
members are not DE in that time series (i.e. expression proﬁle in
the control samples was similar).

When comparing Wigwams with other methods capable of
identifying groups of genes co-expressed across different subsets
of time series data, its main advantages are ﬂexibility, statistical
signiﬁcance testing and relevance of the provided output.
Additionally, Wigwams is able to account for differential expres-
sion of genes in each of the time series, and ensure that gene
proﬁles are only tested for statistically signiﬁcant dependent

co-expression in relevant conditions. The value of testing the
statistical signiﬁcance of detected co-expression can be seen
when comparing Wigwams with the EDISA algorithm (Supper
et al., 2007). When run on a permuted dataset, EDISA identiﬁed
several co-expressed gene modules, whereas Wigwams did not
identify any. Furthermore, we have shown the value of the com-
prehensive nature of Wigwams; it is capable of detecting depend-
ent co-expression that EDISA misses (see Supplementary
Material for details on this analysis). To our knowledge,
Wigwams is the only algorithm capable of mining multiple
time series (on varying time scales) for dependent co-expression
across subsets of the time series.

The modules produced by Wigwams were demonstrated to be
biologically relevant due to enrichment of GO terms (Ashburner
et al., 2000) and known TF binding sites, suggesting shared func-
tion and regulation between module members. We also provide
experimental evidence for co-regulation showing that in yeast, a
set of similar TFs bind to the promoters of multiple genes from a
single Wigwams module. Although YlH does not indicate the
conditions under which these TFs bind to the gene promoters, or
whether they bind in planta, it does indicate the potential for co-
regulation.

The Wigwams tool is easy to use, with intuitive graphical user
interfaces, comprehensive documentation and output provided
in a clear manner that can be readily analyzed by tools such as
BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005) and MEME—LaB (Brown et al.,
2013). The algorithm is ﬂexible, and intuitive parameters can
be used to tailor the output as desired. Additionally, the
module lists are saved as Matlab cell structures, enabling
access to intermediate stages of Wigwams analysis, e.g. to iden-
tify the most statistically signiﬁcant original smaller gene
modules.

A more computationally tractable version of the modiﬁed
hypergeometric test could enable modiﬁcation of the Wigwams
method. To obtain the P—Values for an overlap spanning k sets,
all the P—Values for 2,3, . . . ,k—l sets need to be generated. If the
tests were more efﬁcient, the algorithm could be modiﬁed to use
correlation thresholds instead of pre-deﬁned set sizes when eval-
uating overlaps, and non-DE genes could be excluded from any
analysis without large adverse effects on run time due to varying
universe size between dataset combinations.

Owing to the time and cost of experimental approaches to
genome-wide network elucidation, computational inference of
regulatory networks from time series expression data is a
useful approach. However, despite the multitude of inference
methods available, these methods are still only capable of infer-
ring ‘moderately large dynamic networks’ (Kim et al., 2013).
Wigwams provides output that can be used to extend network
models built with a subset of genes (e.g. using TFs only).
Integrating Wigwams modules with a transcriptional network
model can also provide condition-dependent information, such
as indicating network neighbourhoods active during particular
conditions. Wigwams modules can be Viewed as the footprint of
ﬂux through regulatory networks under different conditions, and
examining the abundance and functionality of modules for vari-
ous combinations of conditions can provide insight into the com-
monality between the responses to different conditions at a more
nuanced level than simple differential expression. Identiﬁcation
of modules showing contradictory expression under different

another) also suggests points of cross-talk within the regulatory
network.

Abstract

Motivation: Chemical cross—linking with mass spectrometry (XL—MS) provides structural informa—
tion for proteins and protein complexes in the form of crosslinked residue proximity and distance
constraints between reactive residues. Utilizing spatial information derived from cross—linked resi—
dues can therefore assist with structural modeling of proteins. Selection of computationally
derived model structures of proteins remains a major challenge in structural biology. The compari—
son of site interactions resulting from XL—MS with protein structure contact maps can assist the

selection of structural models.

1 Introduction

The prediction of protein structures is a major goal of computational
structural biology. Accurate prediction of protein structures remains a
significant challenge. Chemical cross—linking with mass spectrometry
provides residue level distance constraints (DCs) that are useful for
refining protein structural models (Hofmann et 61]., 2015; Rappsilber,
2011). Yet few tools eXist for integrating cross—linking data with pro—
tein structure prediction. To accommodate this lack of tools, herein
we describe the development of XLmap, an algorithm implemented in
R, to integrate cross—linked sites originating from cross-link mass
spectrometry (XL—MS) data with protein contact maps. A protein
structural model can be represented as protein contact map consisting
of a binary two—dimensional matrix of the distance between all pos—
sible amino acid residue pairs of a three—dimensional protein struc—
ture. Euclidean distances between cross—linked residues can be
displayed on protein contact maps. The coincidence of cross—linked
residues and contact points derived from protein structures can then
be determined and quantified, herein as residual scores. We define the
sum of all residual scores determined in this way as the CMScore
and lower CMScores correspond to better agreement between the

cross—linked residue map and the structure—derived protein contact
map. These CMScores can then be used to integrate XL—MS eXperi—
mental data into the process of selection of optimum predicted struc—
tural models (Kelley et 61]., 2015; Yang et 61]., 2015).

2 Package description

XLmap was implemented in the statistical language R and is provided
as an R package in the Supplementary Information. XLmap takes in
PDB format protein structural files and cross—linked site information,
integrates the data, generates overlaid plots of crosslinked sites on
contact maps and assigns a score (CMScore) to each model.

Two files are required as input: (i) a protein structure derived ei—
ther from model prediction software or from empirical data (i.e.
PDB or PDB>dmmCIF file) and (ii) a table of the cross—linked sites in
tab delimited teXt format with the following four columns: protein
UniProt accession 1 (‘prot1’), protein UniProt accession 2 (‘prot2’),
cross—linked residue 1 (‘mod_pos1’) and cross—linked residue
2 (‘mod_pos2’). Currently, XLmap can automatically extract this
data from larger data files such as the outputs from ReACT

(Weisbrod et al., 2013) and xQuest (Rinner et al., 2008).
Alternatively, a text file containing the above four columns alone
can be used as input. An example input file is included in the
Supplementary Text and within the package itself (Supplementary
Text S4f). The user then specifies a desired maximum allowed con—
tact distance in angstroms (A) between the alpha carbons of the two
cross—linked residues (Cor—Cor). Contact maps are generated through
the following command:

>contactmap(DC, UniProt accession)

Images of the contact maps can be exported as ‘.pdf’ files.
Additionally, contactmap will output a table that can be used as the
input for CMscore.

The overlap of the structural map and the crosslinked array is
then calculated as a residual score for the specified DC. By calculat—
ing the residual score across multiple DCs and summing these
scores, a CMScore is generated using the following formula:

 

Total no. of XL residue pairs
S = — 1
CM core 2 (No. of XL pairs that overlap contact map >

As the overlap between the contact map and cross—linked residue
map increases, the CMScore will approach zero. A CMScore and
plot are generated through the following command:

>cmscore(DC—range, UniProt accession)

Users will then be prompted for input of a PDB file and tab de—
limited text file containing cross-link information. Example data in
the package includes structures and crosslink information for the
Acinetobacter baumannii proteins Ab57_2983 and Oxa23, the yeast
protein prA (prA crosslinks derived from Leitner et al., 2012)
and the human protein PPIB.

3 Application and use cases

XLmap generates two features: a protein contact map image with
cross—linked sites displayed and a CMScore plot of distance versus
residual score, which can be used to gauge the level of agreement be—
tween the observed cross—linked sites and the contacting amino acids
at various distances.

First, XLmap generates a protein contact map. For example, the
14 cross—linked sites observed by Leitner et al. (2012) in T-complex
protein 1 subunit alpha from Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(TCPA_YEAST, P12612) are mapped to the crystal structure
PDB = 3P9D at DC 2 18A (Fig. 1A).

>contactmap(18,’P12612’)

Second, XLmap generates a CMScore for a given protein struc—
ture or model based on the number of crosslinked sites that overlap
with the generated contact map across a range of DCs (Fig. 1B).
CMScores can then be used to determine how well sites of crosslink-
ing overlap across multiple structural models. This is exemplified
for the top three de novo structure predictions of Ab57_2983 from
both Phyre2 and iTASSER (6 total models). The model with the best
match to XL—MS data was returned as the second highest scoring
iTASSER model (Supplementary Fig. S1).

Finally, we validated the use of CMScores to differentiate be—
tween a published crystal structure and a decoy structure derived
from the same amino acid sequence. We show that for the
human PPIB protein (Uniprot: P23284), CMScore can accurately
differentiate the true (PDB: 1CYN) and decoy structure based on the

4 Conclusions

XLmap is an R package, which integrates cross—linked site informa—
tion with protein contact maps. XLmap evaluates the overlap be—
tween the cross—linking information with the protein contact map
over a specified distance range resulting in a CM score. In silica pre—
diction of protein structures by common algorithms such as Phyre2
and iTASSER can generate multiple putative models for one protein
sequence (Kelley et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2015). When comparing
multiple models of the same protein using the package described
here, the lowest CMScore corresponds with the model with the high-
est incidence of overlap between crosslinking data and structural
models at the lowest Cor—Cor distance. Therefore, CMScores can be
used to assess predicted structural data based on protein crosslink-
ing. Importantly, XLmap is not restricted by either the model pre—
diction software (e.g. Phyre2 and iTasser) or XL—MS platform (e.g.
crosslinker or MS instrumentation/searching) used to generate input
data. In summary, XLmap provides a new tool to utilize experimen-
tally derived cross-linking information in protein structural analysis.

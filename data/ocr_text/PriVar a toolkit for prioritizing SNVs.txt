ABSTRACT

Next-generation sequencing has become a valuable tool for detecting
mutations involved in Mendelian diseases. However, it is a challenge
to identify the small subset of functionally important mutations from
tens of thousands of rare variants in a whole exome/genome.
Therefore, we developed a toolkit called PriVar, a systematic priori-
tization pipeline that takes into consideration calling quality of the
variants, their predicted functional impact, known connection of
the gene to the disease and the number of mutations in a gene, and
inference from linkage analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Next-generation sequencing (NGS) has become a valuable tool
for discovering potentially causal single-nucleotide variations
(SNVs) as well as short insertions/deletions (indels) for
Mendelian disorders. However, a large number of rare variants
(SNVs and indels) exist in an individual, which poses an unpre-
cedented challenge for pinpointing the causal mutations, not to
mention a relatively high false rate in discovering rare SNVs/
indels. To aid the process in identifying causal mutations from
large sets of rare variants, we designed a toolkit named PriVar
that provides a comprehensive pipeline for prioritizing coding
SNVs and indels for further investigation. Four functional mod-
ules are included in this pipeline: variant annotation, call quality
summary, prediction of functional impact for all the variants and
candidate gene identiﬁcation. A quality summary was used to
help ﬁlter out most of the false positive variant calls based on a
number of quality control parameters. Annotation of the vari-
ants provides essential information on them based on several
databases. The functional prediction module predicts potential
functional impact of variants based on evaluation of results from
multiple existing algorithms. The candidate gene identiﬁcation
module is designed to consolidate information of linkage ana-
lysis, dosage of rare mutations in a gene, known connection of a

gene with the disease in question and other relevant information.
Using the four modules together, PriVar can efﬁciently reduce
the set of potential causal variants to be considered for further
studies.

2 METHODS

PriVar is a Java application with four integrated modules including
variant annotation, quality summary and variant ﬁltering, prediction
of functional impact of variants and candidate gene identiﬁcation
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.1 Variant annotation

PriVar uses a number of databases (Supplementary Material) to annotate
the variants, such as alternative allele frequency (based on 1000 Genome
project, ESP6500 and dbSNP), amino acid changes caused by the variant
or a combination of variants (based on UCSC Genome Browser), and
potential functional impact of variants and genes [deSFP (Liu et al.,
2011) and PROSPECTR (Adie et al., 2005)]. PriVar can support both
th8 and th9 coordinates in input ﬁles and annotate multiple samples
simultaneously.

2.2 Quality summary and variant ﬁltering

This module is used to keep only the reliable subset of variant calls for
further analysis based on various parameters including variant quality,
genotype call quality and sequencing depth, which can be applied either
separately or jointly. PriVar summarizes the overall quality of exonic,
splicing and non-exonic variant calls based on seven criteria, allowing
the user to select appropriate quality cutoffs based on the overall quality
of the data (Supplementary Material): (i) summary of overall quality;
(ii) the concordance with SNP calls if SNP chip data is available;
(iii) the proportion of calls that exist in dbSNP; (iv) transition to trans-
version ratio (Ti/TV); (v) indel to SNV ratio; (vi) insertion to deletion
ratio; and (vii) indel length distribution. When parental data are avail-
able, violation of Mendelian inheritance is also examined and presented
to users. The false discovery rate of SNV calls are calculated by compar-
ing the observed and expected Ti/Tv ratios GDePristo et al., 2011).

2.3 Prediction of functional impact of variants

PriVar also prioritizes SNVs based on the predicted deleterious scores
calculated by results from 10 mainstream mutation and gene evaluation
algorithms (Supplementary Material) using logistic regression.
Functional impact of amino acid changes is predicted based on both
sequence conservation in evolutionary courses and physical chemical
property of the reference and substitution amino acids. More information
provides better separation between neutral and deleterious SNVs
compared with other programs (Supplementary Fig. S2). For indels,

Pri Var

 

their functional impact is evaluated based on the prediction values of
non-synonymous SNVs caused by the indel after a Sidak’s correction.

2.4 Candidate gene identification

PriSNV contains six candidate gene selection functions to help choose a
subset of genes of high interest for further analysis. The strategies for
selection are controlled by the users depending on the data in hand and
the assumptions for a particular study. These strategies can be used in
conjunction with each other to increase power and to reduce search space.

2.4.] Linkage-based strategy If multiple family members are
affected, the genes within long identity-by-descent (IBD) regions shared
by affected family members can be identiﬁed. Because of high noise
of sequencing data, PriSNV only uses common SNV sites existing in
HapMap for corresponding populations and follows a no-violation rule
for identiﬁcation of IBD sharing, while the haplotype allele frequency is
also calculated to help evaluate the probability of sharing by chance
(Supplementary Material).

2.4.2 Runs 0f homozygosity For diseases observed in families of
consanguineous marriages family, it is highly likely that the causal mu-
tation is in a region of run of homozygosity (ROH). The ROH regions
are identiﬁed using only common SNVs and should satisfy the same
criteria deﬁned for IBD regions, similar to what we reported before
(Zhang et al., 2011). ROH may also indicate large deletions or unipar-
ental disomy.

2.4.3 ‘Double—hit’ on a gene If recessive inheritance is assumed for
a disease, genes carrying homozygous mutations or potential compound
heterozygous variants will be identiﬁed by PriVar. Because phase is usu-
ally unknown, all genes with more than one rare non-synonymous SNV
or indel will be highlighted for further analysis (Supplementary Material).

2.4.4 Mutation burden Because of genetic heterogeneity, muta-
tions may be enriched in disease-related genes, although they may
occur at different positions. PriSNV prioritizes the genes based on the
percentage of patients carrying one or more rare non-synonymous SNVs
or indels for a gene (Supplementary Material).

2.4.5 De novo mutations The de novo mutations occur during mei-
osis and only appear in a child but not the parents. If parental data are
available and have high coverage and quality on the same position, the
rare non-synonymous de novo SNVs/indels will be identiﬁed as potential
causal mutations.

2.4.6 Disease candidate genes Candidate genes are selected based
on previous studies on the disease. Well-established relationship between
genes and diseases is extracted from Phenopedia database of HuGE
Navigator H u et al., 2008). In addition, customized gene list is also
accepted from users to pinpoint the candidate variants from those genes.

3 DATA AND RESULT

PriVar was applied to whole exome sequencing data from a
patient affected by early-onset Crohn’s disease. Raw reads were

aligned to human reference genome th9 using Burrows-Wheeler
Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2009) followed by Genome
Analysis Toolkit (GATK) data processing pipeline to obtain vari-
ant calls (SNV and Indel) (Supplementary Material). Cutoff on
sequencing depth was determined based on SNP call concordance
between sequencing and SNP chip data, Ti/Tv ratio and indel
length distribution (Supplementary Fig. S3). A 10-fold cutoff
was determined to be an appropriate criterion for ﬁltering out
most of the false variants. A candidate gene-based strategy dra-
matically reduced the total number of genes to be considered from
1149 to 42, whereas a ‘Double-hit’—based strategy ﬁltered out
another 32 genes that have only one novel variant
(Supplementary Table S3). After removing variants with deleteri-
ous score below 0.8, only eight variants and ﬁve genes were left.
Among them, ILIORA was eventually proved to be the disease-
causing gene through a combination of genetics and functional
characterization (Mao et al., 2012). The success of PriVar in deﬁn-
ing causal mutation in this example indicates that it could pro-
vide signiﬁcant help to biologists in prioritizing SNV and indel
calls in a systematic way to reduce search space for further ana-
lysis and experimental veriﬁcation. Of course it should be cau-
tioned that a causal mutation may be missed from the original
variant calls because of various reasons. More effort is needed
to incorporate more biological and population genetics informa-
tion into variant analysis to help with causal mutation
identiﬁcation.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Single-molecule force spectroscopy has facilitated the
experimental investigation of biomolecular force-coupled kinetics,
from which the kinetics at zero force can be extrapolated via explicit
theoretical models. The atomic force microscope (AFM) in particular
is routinely used to study protein unfolding kinetics, but only rarely
protein folding kinetics. The discrepancy arises because mechanical
protein refolding studies are more technically challenging.

Results: We developed software that can drive and analyse
mechanical refolding experiments when used with the commercial
AFM setup ‘Picoforce AFM’, Bruker (previously Digital Instruments).
We expect the software to be easily adaptable to other AFM
setups. We also developed an improved method for the statistical
characterization of protein folding kinetics, and implemented it into
an AFM-independent software module.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biochemical reactions commonly proceed Via large conformational
changes, resulting in a well-deﬁned mechanical reaction coordinate
on which they can be monitored. Since force is a determinant factor
in the rate of such reactions, single-molecule force spectroscopy
(SMFS) emerged as an invaluable tool in their investigation under
mechanical tension (Bustamante et al., 2004; Kumar and Li, 2010).
Thanks to its remarkable ability to stretch and monitor one molecule
at a time, SMFS seeks to achieve the long-standing goal of mapping
the energy landscape of biomolecules (e.g. proteins, RNA) on a
well-deﬁned reaction coordinate, even for proteins which show
irreversible thermal or chemical unfolding (J ollymore and Li, 2010).

In particular, protein folding kinetics can be studied at the single
molecule level using the atomic force microscope (AFM). To this
end, protein modules can be ﬁrst unfolded and subsequently allowed
to refold while subjected to a ‘force-clamp’ (Fernandez and Li,
2004; Garcia-Manyes et al., 2007, 2009b), or they can be directly

observed to refold at ﬁxed extension Via ‘lock—in force spectroscopy’
(Garcia-Manyes et al., 2009a). Such techniques depend on recent
technological advances implemented in custom-built AFMs with
very limited availability. Alternatively, the AFM can be used in the
more traditional ‘Velocity-clamp’ mode to drive protein modules to
fold under mechanical tension Via the ‘double-pulse protocol’ (see
Suplementary Material). Shortly, the distance between the base of
the cantilever and the surface, rather than the stretching force, is
maintained constant for some amount of time, allowing previously
unfolded protein modules to refold (Bullard et al., 2006; Cao and
Li, 2007; Carrion-Vazquez et al., 1999).

Despite the widespread availability of AFM instrumentation
supporting the velocity-clamp mode of operation, single molecule
folding kinetics studies remain rather scarce in the scientiﬁc
literature, likely due to the unavailability of mandatory software
technology. We ﬁll this gap by making such software freely
available. To validate our software, we studied the folding kinetics
of protein GB1 (Cao et al., 2006) and obtained a kinetics
characterization similar to the previously published one (Cao and
Li, 2007).

2 APPROACH

Our software contains three main components:

(1) An automated procedure for driving refolding experiments
through Nanoscope V6 software, in conjunction with
Picoforce AFM and Nanoscope IIIa controller, Bruker. For
each execution of the double-pulse protocol, our software
instructs the Nanoscope software to execute a ‘Nanoscope
script’ and capture a ‘Nanoscope strip chart’. Importantly, the
actual bending of the cantilever is detected from the strip
chart ﬁle and the starting position is adjusted accordingly for
the next double-pulse so as to counterbalance accumulating
drift (Oberhauser et al., 2001). Section 1 in Supplementary
Material contains more information on the implemented
double-pulse protocol.

(2) Ofﬂine tools for automated peak identiﬁcation, force
measurements, Worm-like chain (Bustamante et al., 1994)
ﬁts and data ﬁltering. Tools are also included for manually
improving the results of some of the automated tasks such as
zero-force baseline and contact point identiﬁcation.

(3) A standalone, AFM-independent ofﬂine procedure for
the statistical characterization of protein folding kinetics
from mechanical refolding experiments with homomeric
polyproteins, based on the analytical model of Section 3.1.

3 METHODS
3.1 Maximum likelihood estimation of folding kinetic
parameters

We adopt Bell’s approximation (Bell, 1978; Walcott, 2008) to Kramers’
reaction-rate theory (Hanggi et al., 1990), which describes the force-
dependent folding rate as kf(F)=k19 exp[—F Axf /(KbT)], where K}, is the

Boltzmann constant, T is the temperature in Kelvin, k}? is the spontaneous
folding rate and Axf is the folding distance. We aim to extract the last two
mentioned parameters from refolding experiments.

Traditionally, data were collected in a few ﬁxed conﬁgurations, where
a conﬁguration is deﬁned by the amount of time allowed for refolding
and the inferred force at the start of the waiting period. It was therefore
assumed that the same conﬁguration can be reproduced exactly multiple
times, ignoring any variation between double-pulse protocol executions.
It was also assumed that the residual force remains constant during the
waiting time (Cao and Li, 2007; Carrion-Vazquez et al., 1999), ignoring the
fact that it increases after each folding event. Furthermore, it was assumed
that the total number of modules that could refold is limited by the extension
during the waiting period (Cao and Li, 2007), breaking the assumption of
the ideal spring cantilever. The mean and SD of the refolding ratio would
then be computed for each conﬁguration and then ﬁtted to an exponential
formula based on Bell’s equation or to Monte Carlo simulations based on
it, ignoring the fact that such summary statistics are not suﬁ‘icient (Lehmann
and Casella, 1998), Le. they do not capture all possible information about
the parameters.

We overcome all the above limitations by introducing a Maximum
Likelihood estimation procedure. Shortly, the stretching force is computed
by solving the WLC cubic equation (Aioanei et al., 2009), and the likelihood
function is computed as the product of the probability to observe the
actual number of folding events for each double-pulse protocol execution.
The maximum likelihood is then located over a grid of (k2, Axf) values,
and estimation errors are computed by case resampling (see Section 2 in
Supplementary Material).

3.2 Folding kinetics of protein GB1

We estimated the kinetic parameters of protein GB1 in buffer Tris—HCl
(10mM, pH 7.5) by performing mechanical refolding experiments
with homomeric polyproteins (GBl)g and (GB1)16 (see Section 3 in
Supplementary Material for experimental data statistics). A sample trace can
be seen in Figure 1.

We obtained the kinetic parameters Axf=2.53 :l:0.12nm and
k}? =500:l: 85 s‘1 errors representing one SD. Our kinetics characterization
is roughly compatible with previously published values of Axf=2.1nm
and 139 = 720j:1203_1 (Cao and Li, 2007).

4 DISCUSSION

Mechanical refolding experiments can be performed with typical
commercial velocity-clamp AFM instrumentation, and we provide
an out-of—the-box software solution for performing and analysing
such experiments in conjunction with Picoforce AFM, Bruker. We
expect our software to be easily adaptable to other AFM setups.
In fact, since the analytical model of Section 3.1 is not speciﬁc
to a particular AFM, its implementation can already be used with
refolding data obtained with any other AFM. Furthermore, we
developed all the software in the Java and Python programming
languages to ensure its portability across all major operating
systems.

Fig. 1. (Colour online) A force-extension trace according to the double-
pulse protocol with the homomeric polyprotein (GBl)16. The lower curve
represents the protein fetching phase, during which the polyprotein attached
non-speciﬁcally to the cantilever and then a total of 15 modules have been
subsequently unfolded. The higher curve is shifted by 260 pN just for display
purposes, and it represents the phase where the same molecule is pulled
for the second time. Note that only 15 out of the 16 modules could have
refolded, since one module was not unfolded during the fetching phase. The
vertical dashed line represents the piezo position during the waiting time
lapse relative to the resting position of the cantilever tip, and its numerical
value is shown together with the length of the time lapse at the top of
the ﬁgure. Each WLC ﬁt is shown redundantly shifted higher for display
purposes. The contour length at the start of the waiting time lapse (before
any refolding) is indicated in the bottom-right position.

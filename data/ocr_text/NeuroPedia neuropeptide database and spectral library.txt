ABSTRACT

Summary: Neuropeptides are essential for cell—cell communication
in neurological and endocrine physiological processes in health
and disease. While many neuropeptides have been identified in
previous studies, the resulting data has not been structured to
facilitate further analysis by tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS),
the main technology for high-throughput neuropeptide identification.
Many neuropeptides are difficult to identify when searching MS/MS
spectra against large protein databases because of their atypical
lengths (e.g. shorter/longer than common tryptic peptides) and
lack of tryptic residues to facilitate peptide ionization/fragmentation.
NeuroPedia is a neuropeptide encyclopedia of peptide sequences
(including genomic and taxonomic information) and spectral libraries
of identified MS/MS spectra of homolog neuropeptides from multiple
species. Searching neuropeptide MS/MS data against known
NeuroPedia sequences will improve the sensitivity of database
search tools. Moreover, the availability of neuropeptide spectral
libraries will also enable the utilization of spectral library search
tools, which are known to further improve the sensitivity of peptide
identification. These will also reinforce the confidence in peptide
identifications by enabling visual comparisons between new and
previously identified neuropeptide MS/MS spectra.

1 INTRODUCTION

Neuropeptides are peptide neurotransmitters and hormones that
mediate cell—cell communication for regulation of physiological
functions and biological processes. Understanding the role and
regulation of neuropeptide forms in health, disease and drug
treatments requires the ability to globally analyze neuropeptide
expression in an unbiased form. Mass spectrometry (MS)
based neuropeptidomics is highly suited for untargeted, global
neuropeptides studies (Bora et al., 2008; Fricker et al., 2007; Hook
et al. 2010; Li et al. 2008; Svensson et al., 2007). However, the
unique characteristics of neuropeptides (e. g. short/long sequences or
nontryptic) presents difﬁculties for identiﬁcation from tandem mass
spectrometry (MS/MS) with popular database search tools such as
SEQUEST (Eng et al., 1994), and Mascot (Perkins et al., 1999). For

example, short neuropeptides can lead to inaccurate search results
because the database search tools usually assign lower scores to
short peptides. Conversely, long or nontryptic neuropeptides are
difﬁcult to identify because most database search tools are trained for
tryptic peptides cleaved at K/R and because peptide fragmentation
processes for long neuropeptides is usually not efﬁcient. In addition,
searching larger databases takes more time because of the number of
comparisons and reduces the number of resulting identiﬁcations by
allowing more choices for false positives (Nesvizhskii et al., 2010).
Therefore, while some neuropeptides can be identiﬁed with current
bioinformatics approaches, complete neuropeptidomics will require
the design of novel computational tools for identifying both short
and longer neuropeptides using tandem mass spectrometry (Hook
et al., 2010).

The online neuropeptide repository at www.neur0peptides.nl
provides non-searchable neuropeptide sequences, gene names,
precursor names and expected expression in the human brain. It
also offers hyperlinks to bioinformatics databases on genomes,
transcripts, protein structure and brain expression (Burbach et al.,
2009). Unfortunately, this resource is not designed to enable
identiﬁcation from MS/MS data. Users must search their data using
other peptide database search tools and later compare the results
against the neuropeptide list. This process is much less sensitive
and requires time-consuming manual matching of search results to
information in existing resources.

NeuroPedia is a specialized neuropeptide database and spectral
library that is directly searchable using mass spectrometry data. In
addition to the expected improvement in sensitivity from searching
against a small targeted sequence database, the neuropeptide spectral
libraries further improve identiﬁcation efﬁciency, sensitivity and
reliability by considering all spectral features, including actual
fragment intensities, neutral losses from fragments and various
uncommon or even unknown fragments to determine the best
matches. NeuroPedia spectral libraries are compatible with the
publicly available spectral library search tool M-SPLIT (Wang et al.,
2010) and can be easily converted to other spectral library formats.
To further facilitate visual evaluation of neuropeptide MS/MS
spectra, NeuroPedia provides annotated spectrum images for every
library spectrum and further separates spectral libraries by species,
digestion enzyme and instrument type (see Supplementary Table).

2 METHODS

NeuroPedia aggregates neuropeptide data from in-house mass spectrometry
experiments with data from multiple reference websites and public spectral
library. Using python HTML parsing and manual typing, we gathered
neuropeptide names, gene families, gene names and their protein names

from the neuropeptide repository, Handbook of Biologically Active Peptides
(Kastin et al., 2006), and UniProt (Jain et al., 2009). In addition, we
also obtained neuropeptide sequences, their start and end positions on the
precursor protein, species, RefSeq ID and UniProt ID from UniProt. We
collected NCBI taxonomy ID and gene reference ID from NCBI. Using
cluster searching at 50% identity in UniProt, we expanded the catalog of
species from human into chimpanzee, mouse, rat, bovine, rhesus macaque
and California sea hare. We further analyzed the collected neuropeptide
sequences to classify sequence similarities between neuropeptides into
three match types: (a) identical if the sequences are exactly the same, (b)
overlapping if the preﬁx of one sequence exactly matches the sufﬁx of the
other sequence for at least k characters, where k is half the length of longest
sequence and (c) homolog if overlapping as in (b) but allowing up to two
amino acid substitutions. Neuropeptide spectra were collected from NIST
spectral libraries (Stein et al., 2009), and in-house datasets (Bruand et al.,
2011; Gupta et al., 2010).

All collected MS/MS spectra were searched against the NeuroPedia
sequences database using InsPecT (Tanner et al., 2005) at http://proteomics
.ucsd.edu with search parameters: Instrument (ESI-ION—TRAP or QTOF),
Cysteine protecting group (Carbamidomethylation +57), Protease (Trypsin,
None), 2Da Parent mass tolerance, 0.5Da Ion tolerance, no post-translational
modiﬁcations and including common contaminants (digestion enzymes and
Human Keratins). V8 digested runs were searched as above but with the
protease parameter set to ‘None’.

3 RESULTS

The NeuroPedia spectral library contains a total of 3401 identiﬁed
spectra in 10 MGF ﬁles as described in Supplementary Table.
In addition to providing libraries for all identiﬁed spectra,
NeuroPedia also contains libraries of manually validated high/low-
quality spectra for unique combinations of peptide sequence and
precursor charge states. The NeuroPedia sequence database contains
847 neuropeptides from human, chimpanzee, mouse, rat, cow,
California sea hare, rhesus macaque and medicinal leech. Using
InsPecT or any other database search tool, new MS/MS data can be
searched against this sequence database. As shown in Total/UniProt
in Supplementary Table, searching against NeuroPedia identiﬁes
many more spectra than the UniProt database. Out of all possible
340 725 pairs of neuropeptides sequences (without considering
species), there are 531 pairs with identical sequences (type a),
5020 pairs with overlapping sequences (type b), and 9185 pairs with
homolog sequences (type c). A detailed description of the format of
the databases is provided in Supplementary Materials.

4 CONCLUSIONS

NeuroPedia is a convenient and accessible repository of
neuropeptide sequences and MS/MS spectral libraries. It offers
advantages in terms of faster and more precise identiﬁcation

of small sized or nontryptic neuropeptides. We anticipate that
NeuroPedia will continue to grow as data from more laboratories
and experiments are contributed directly to NeuroPedia or otherwise
become publicly available in mass spectrometry data repositories.
In particular, it is expected that NeuroPedia will expand to
include neuropeptide information for more species and mass
spectrometry data of post-translationally modiﬁed neuropeptides.

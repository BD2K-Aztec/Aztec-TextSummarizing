Abstract

Motivation: Genome—wide association studies (GWASs) are effective for describing genetic com—
plexities of common diseases. Phenome—wide association studies (PheWASs) offer an alternative
and complementary approach to GWAS using data embedded in the electronic health record (EHR)
to define the phenome. International Classification of Disease version 9 (ICD9) codes are used
frequently to define the phenome, but using ICD9 codes alone misses other clinically relevant infor—
mation from the EHR that can be used for PheWAS analyses and discovery.

Results: As an alternative to ICD9 coding, a text—based phenome was defined by 23 384 clinically
relevant terms extracted from Marshfield Clinic’s EHR. Five single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs) with known phenotypic associations were genotyped in 4235 individuals and associated
across the text—based phenome. All five SNPs genotyped were associated with expected terms
(P< 0.02), most at or near the top of their respective PheWAS ranking. Raw association results indi—
cate that text data performed equivalently to ICD9 coding and demonstrate the utility of informa—

 

tion beyond ICD9 coding for application in PheWAS.

1 Introduction

The genetic complexities of common diseases have been well—defined
by the use of the genome wide—association study (GWAS). Aside
from only a few examples, GWASS have failed to identify single nu—
cleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that reach a threshold, where they
can be used to predict, prevent or even treat complex diseases. This
may be due in part to disease heterogeneity and the fact that most
SNPs genotyped during a GWAS represent tag SNPs for unknown
and ungenotyped causal variants (Goldstein 2009; Manolio et 61].,
2009; McCarthy et 61]., 2008; Need and Goldstein, 2010; Visscher
et 61]., 2012). As a complementary or alternative strategy to GWAS,
phenome—wide association studies (PheWASs) have demonstrated
their effectiveness for rediscovering GWAS associations while
also identifying novel disease—SNP correlations (Hebbring, 2014).

Whereas GWAS is a phenotype—to—genotype strategy, PheWAS re—
verses this paradigm by exchanging the disease and genome in a
GWAS with a specific genetic variant and phenome in a PheWAS.
As such, PheWAS is a genotype—to—phenotype strategy.

The first PheWAS was published in 2010 by Denny et a]. In this
first proof-of—principle study, five disease—associated SNPs previ—
ously identified by GWAS were genotyped in a cohort of 6005 pa—
tients from Vanderbilt University Medical Center. Each SNP was
associated with hundreds of International Classification of Disease
version 9 (ICD9) codes that defined the ICD9—based phenome. Of
the five SNPs, four demonstrated that the PheWAS technique was
able to rediscover the expected associations (Denny et 61]., 2010).
The advantage of PheWAS over GWAS is that PheWAS has the cap—
acity to identify multiple diseases that share a common genetic

etiology. For example, one of the SNPs genotyped in the original
proof—of—principle study was a SNP that tags for the HLA-
DRBI "'1501 allele (rs3135388). This SNP is known to be associated
with multiple sclerosis (MS) (Hindorff, 2012). As expected,
rs3135 388 was associated with the ICD9 code for MS, but was also
associated with other conditions, including erythematous conditions
(Denny et al., 2010). This association was subsequently validated in
an independent PheWAS (Hebbring et al., 2013). Importantly, if
multiple diseases share a common genetic etiology, then it may be
hypothesized that drugs used to treat one disease may be repurposed
to treat another. As such, PheWAS has the capacity to direct novel
drug repositioning studies (Rastegar—Mojarad et al., 2015).

A prerequisite of the PheWAS strategy is the availability of in—
depth phenotypic information. Not surprisingly, the majority of
PheWASs conducted to date have been applied to cohorts of clinic
patients linked to electronic health record (EHR) systems. An EHR
system can contain longitudinal health data, including prescription
records, laboratory results, physician notes and diagnostic codes,
specifically ICD9 coding. The advantage of ICD9 codes is that they
offer a spectrum of phenotypic information that is intuitively struc—
tured by clinical disease classifications. The first proof-of—principle
PheWAS study described previously used ICD9 codes to define the
phenome (Denny et al., 2010). The majority of the PheWASs con—
ducted thereafter have also leveraged ICD9 coding (Carroll et al.,
2014; Denny et al., 2011, 2013; Hebbring et al., 2013; Neuraz
et al., 2013; Ritchie et al., 2013; Shameer et al., 2013); although
some have applied ICD10 coding (Neuraz et al., 2013) while others
have applied epidemiologic data (Pendergrass et al., 2011, 2012,
2013). In the United States, ICD9 codes are predominantly used ad—
ministratively for billing. Although ICD9 coding is rooted to clinical
manifestations, its reliability is known to be variable (Leone et al.,
2006; Hennessy et al., 2010) and ICD9 codes may not provide ad—
equate phenotypic information for many conditions. This is particu-
larly relevant as many ICD9 codes define diseases as ‘other’ or ‘not
elsewhere classified’. To address these limitations, other data types
beyond ICD9 coding may be used as an alternative approach to de—
fine the phenome for PheWAS. Such data could include clinical
documentations.

Clinical documentations are often maintained in an EHR system
as text data for easy reference during clinical care and can be a
powerful source of clinical information for research. Clinical docu—
mentation can provide insights into a patient’s past clinical history,
current condition, prognosis and treatment. Clinical text data often
contains information regarding drugs prescribed and has been mined
to identify drug—drug interactions (Iyer et al., 2014), adverse drug
events (Liu et al., 2012) and off—label drug use (Jung et al., 2014).
Of relevance, clinical text data has also been applied to the identifi—
cation of specific diseases and may be used to predict ICD9 codes
(Kavuluru et al., 2013; Marafino et al., 2014).

In this study, we test the hypothesis that clinical text data can be
used to extract extensive phenotypic data to create a text—based
phenome. Importantly, we demonstrate that a text—based phenome
can be used for a PheWAS, so that EHR systems may be more
widely applied to advance genetics and precision medicine.

2 Methods

2.1 Population and genotyping

All patients genotyped come from Marshfield Clinic’s Personalized
Medicine Research Project (PMRP), has been described previously
(McCarty et al., 2005, 2008). In short, PMRP is a cohort of

approximately 20 000 Marshfield Clinic patients over 18 years of
age that reside within a 19 zip code region surrounding Marshfield,
Wisconsin, USA. PMRP is 98% white/non—Hispanic with 77%
claiming German ancestry. Importantly, all PMRP participants are
linked to Marshfield Clinic’s extensive EHR system with most par—
ticipants having over 30 years of continuous care captured in
Marshfield Clinic’s EHR system. Samples genotyped include 4235
PMRP patients all over 50 years of age (mean:74, median=75)
initially selected as a cohort for the study of high—density lipoprotein
levels or cataract disease (Turner et al., 2011). The 4235 samples
were previously genotyped on Illumina’s 660W BeadChip (Illumina,
San Diego, CA) and previously applied to PheWAS analysis (Denny
et al., 2011, 2013; Hebbring et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2014).

We analyzed five SNPs for association by text—based PheWAS.
These five SNPs were selected based on reported associations by
GWAS (Hindorff, 2012) and previously use as control SNPs for an
ICD9—based PheWAS (Ye et al., 2014). The five SNPs include
rs3135388, rs9501572, r512678919, r5220073 and r51061170,
which are known to be associated with MS, ankylosing spondylitis,
triglyceride levels, atrial fibrillation and age—related macular degen—
eration (AMD), respectively. Rs9501572 and r512678919 were
genotyped on the Illumina 660W BeadChip as mentioned earlier.
SNPs rs3135388, r52200733 and r51061170 were genotyped by a
Sequenom assay (Sequenom, San Diego, CA), as described previ—
ously (Hebbring et al., 2013; Ye et al., 2014).

2.2 Text—based phenome

Marshfield Clinic’s EHR system dates back to 1984, with electronic
maintenance of clinical documentation since 1991. A total of
1 564 831 clinical notes were extracted from the 4235 patients
described earlier representing 423 537905 unique words. On aver—
age, each patient had approximately 372 clinical notes. For each pa—
tient, all clinical notes were concatenated and scrubbed of personal
identifiers using the de—identification software package ‘de—id’
(Goldberger et al., 2000; Neamatullah et al., 2008). All words were
then broken down into four possible combinations. They include
unigrams (one word), bigrams (two adjacent words), trigrams (three
adjacent words) and 4—grams (four adjacent words). An example of
these word structures can be seen in Figure 1 for a physician note
indicating ‘ . .. Patient has evidence of macular degeneration ....’
There were a total of 270 885 unigrams, 7507412 bigrams,
40 568 628 trigrams and 92 755 315 4-grams totaling 141 102 240
individual word strings in this sample set (Fig. 2). It is expected that
these word strings can be used to identify and define clinically rele-
vant phenotypes.

with clinical notes. As such, word strings greater than 4—grams were
not included as they did not add significant clinical information. As
with the clinical text data, all extracted strings from the UMLS med—
ical dictionaries were also broken down into their respected unig—
rams, bigrams, trigrams and 4—grams totaling 567213 possible word
strings. A total of 92338 word strings were observed in both the
UMLS medical dictionaries and clinical text data. A total of 23 384
strings were observed in at least 50 unique patients in the population
(Fig. 2). It is these 23 384 word strings that defined the text—based
phenome that consists of 97% disease terms and 3% drug terms.
Individuals with a given word string were considered cases for that
word string, whereas all others were considered controls. No add—
itional word processing was conducted, such as negation analysis.
Bigrams represented the largest proportion of the text—based phe—
nome (Fig. 3). The mean and median case size was 533 and 221, re—
spectively. All word strings extracted that define the text—based
phenome are available in Supplementary Table S1.

2.3 PheWAS analysis

All distinct word strings were translated into corresponding case—
control groupings. For each SNP, genotypes were associated across
all 23 384 word strings that defined the text—based phenome. As a

and drug terms (black bars). Indicated are the numbers in each category

comparison, ICD9 codes defining expected phenotypes, as defined
by a previous PheWAS (Ye et al., 2014), were also extracted from
Marshfield Clinic’s EHR system and associated with SNP genotype.
Associations were measured by 12 analysis. Phi correlation coeffi-
cients were calculated to measure correlations between cases and
controls identified by clinical text data and ICD9 coding. Systematic
confounding in the SNP—phenotype associations was assessed by a
Q—Q plot for each SNP; none was observed (Supplementary Fig. S2).
All analyses were conducted using the R statistical package.

For all five SNPs, the expected word strings were associated with
the SNP genotype (P< 0.02) (Table 1). SNPs rs9501572 and
rs3135388 had expected word strings nominally associated with
SNP genotype including ‘spondylitis’ (P = 0.018) (Fig. 4A) and ‘MS’

(P=0.0045) (Fig. 4B), respectively. R52200733, r512678919 and
r51061170 had multiple expected word strings that were associated
with SNP genotype at or near the top of their respective PheWAS
(Supplementary Table S2). R52200733, known to be associated
with atrial fibrillation, was associated with multiple word strings
related to atrial fibrillation (Fig. 4C) and r512678919, known to be
associated with triglyceride levels and in strong disequilibrium with
a nonsense SNP in the gene lipoprotein lipase (r5328), was
associated with word strings ‘elevated triglycerides’ and
‘hypertriglyceridemia’ (Fig. 4D). R51061170, an AMD—associated
SNP, had the strongest PheWAS results. R51061170 was strongly
associated with the word string ‘macular degeneration’ (P : 1.8E-8)
followed by the terms ‘non—exudative’ (P :2.3E—7) and ‘exudative’
(P: 1.4E—6), which describe AMD subtypes. In addition, the term
‘visudyne’, a drug commonly prescribed to treat AMD, was also
strongly associated with the r51061170 genotype (P : 3.9E—7) sug—
gesting that drug data may provide additional evidence when inter—
preting PheWAS results (Fig. 4E). Assuming independence, these
associations pass a conservative SNP—dependent Bonferroni correc-
tion threshold (P<2.1E—6 assuming oc<0.05 and 23384 tests/
phenotypes). All associations with P < 0.001 are reported in
Supplementary Table S2.

3.2 Text—based versus ICD9—based associations

The top expected association results generated using text data were
compared with the top expected ICD9 codes previously identified
by an ICD9—based PheWAS (Ye et al., 2014). For all expected
phenotypes, there were more cases identified by clinical text data
than by ICD9 coding. For example, ICD9 coding identified 20 MS
cases compared with 255 cases that were identified by the word
string ‘MS’ observed in clinical notes. For three of the five SNPs, top
association results were stronger using clinical text data. Not sur—
prisingly, cases and controls identified by text data were variably
correlated with cases and controls identified by ICD9 coding. AMD
and atrial fibrillation had the strongest correlations. For all ex—
amples, text data identified more unique cases that did not overlap
ICD9 coding (Table 1). Because the text—based phenome was ini—
tially filtered by word strings observed at least 50 times in the popu—
lation, which may result in missed findings for rare conditions (i.e.
MS and ankylosing spondylitis), rs3135388 and rs9501572 were
reanalyzed without any frequency filter. No additional expected
word strings were identified (data not shown).

4 Discussion

PheWASs are quickly proving effective at rediscovering and dis—
covering new gene—disease associations. Thus far, most PheWASs
have focused on genetic variants with predetermined SNP—disease
associations (Hebbring, 2014), the largest of which was conducted
on 3144 SNPs previously identified by GWAS (Denny et al., 2013).
PheWAS exhibits the power to identify novel associations and link
multiple conditions to a shared genetic etiology (Carroll et al., 2014;
Denny et al., 2011, 2013; Hebbring et al., 2013; Neuraz et al.,
2013; Pendergrass et al., 2013; Ritchie et al., 2013; Shameer et al.,
2013). A commonality for the majority of PheWASs published to
date is the use of ICD9 coding to define the phenome.

An advantage of ICD9—based phenomes is the logical architec—
ture of the codes such that similar conditions have similar codes. For
example, ICD9 codes 390—45 9 define diseases of the circulatory sys—
tem, ICD9 codes 410—414 define different sub—types of ischemic
heart disease, ICD9 codes 410.0—410.9 define acute myocardial

infarctions and at the highest phenotypic resolution, ICD9 codes
410.00—410.02 define acute myocardial infarctions of anterolateral
wall. It is not surprising that ICD9—based PheWASs have utilized a
collapsing strategy to define cases and controls at varying levels of
phenotypic resolution (Hebbring, 2014). The current text—based
phenome was arranged alphabetically, and as such, lacks intuitive
structure. Another challenge of a text—based phenome is the inter—
pretation of the word strings. Cases and controls in an ICD9—based
phenome are defined by the existence of a given ICD9 code.
Although errors exist in the coding, it is assumed that ICD9 coding
is assigned based on clinical manifestations. In comparison, pheno-
types described by text data may be less clear. Cases and controls
may be incompletely assigned because of misspellings or alternative
word usage, such as abbreviations. Furthermore, words defining a
text—based phenome may capture a term, yet context beyond the
term may be lacking. For example, non—specific terms such as ‘pos—
itional’ (Supplementary Table S2) are captured in the text—based
phenome. Further curation of the text—based phenome to remove
such terms may improve the effectiveness of a text—based PheWAS.
Using biomedical named entity recognition tools may be one ap—
proach (Leaman et al, 2008).

In addition to non—specific terms, it is conceivable that associ—
ation results from clinically meaningful terms may still be difficult
to interpret. Some clinical notes may indicate that a ‘patient E
atrial fibrillation’, ‘patient does not have atrial fibrillation’ and/or
‘patient has a family history of atrial fibrillation’. Under these cir—

 

cumstances, all individuals with the word string ‘atrial fibrillation’
will be lumped together independent of meaning. This may explain
why ‘atrial fibrillation’ was not the top word string for r52200733,
although it was still in the top 20 (P : 7.1E—4). The application of
natural language processing techniques, such as negation analysis
(Agarwal et al., 2011) and ontology—driven concept extraction
(Osborne et al., 2007), may be effective when addressing these chal—
lenges. Regardless, raw association results indicate that text data
performed equivalently to ICD9 coding, and in some instances, clin—
ical text data outperformed ICD9 coding (Fig. 4 and Table 1).

Like GWAS, PheWAS is challenged by multiple comparison
testing. The current standard for adjusting multiple comparison test—
ing has been the application of a Bonferroni correction (Hebbring,
2014). Unique to PheWAS is the correlative structure in the pheno—
typic data. As described earlier, in an ICD9—based PheWAS, similar
ICD9 codes may be correlated, especially in phenomes that use a
collapsing strategy to define cases and controls at different pheno—
typic resolutions. Furthermore, correlations may also exist across
codes (Hebbring, 2014). This text—based PheWAS is no different. A
good example of the correlative structure in the text data may in—
clude the atrial fibrillation SNP r52200733 where the bigram ‘fibril-
lation with’, is rooted in the trigram ‘atrial fibrillation with’, with
both showing similar associations (Fig. 4C). Of all SNPs tested, the
AMD SNP r51061170 not only passed a SNP—dependent Bonferroni
correction (P <2.1E—6) but also passed an experiment—wise correc—
tion [P<4.3E—7 assuming oc<0.05 and 116920 total tests (total
tests : 5 SNP X 23 384 phenotypes)] (Fig. 4E).

Like ICD9 codes, clinical text data can be efficiently extracted
from an EHR system and can be effectively applied to a PheWAS
(Fig. 4). With all of the words in a text—based phenome rooted to
standard terms from a medical dictionary (Fig. 2), this approach
may be easily translatable to other EHR systems. Clinical text data
has the capacity to describe phenotypic information at a high reso-
lution, while also allowing the use of drug information that may
provide additional insights into the interpretation of the PheWAS re—
sult, as demonstrated by the AMD—associated SNP and its

association with the AMD drug Visudyne (Fig. 4E). Because ICD9
codes are used primarily for billing, only those conditions that arise
during a clinical visit are recorded. For patients who come in and
out of a service area, or for conditions that predate an EHR system,
ICD9 coding may not provide a comprehensive assessment of a pa—
tient’s disease history. In comparison, clinical notes may capture
both current and in—depth historical health information. This may
explain in part the larger case sizes for clinical text data compared
with ICD9 coding. Of interest, text data and ICD9 coding demon—
strated similar associations, yet both datasets had incomplete correl—
ations between the cases and controls identified by either text data
or ICD9 coding (Table 1). In general, a larger percentage of cases
are unique to text data compared with cases identified by ICD9
coding. For example, cases of ankylosing spondylitis and MS were
dramatically different in the text—based approached compared with
the ICD9—based approach suggesting the potential for increased false
positives in a text—based phenome. Conversely, SNP r512678919,
known to be associated with triglyceride metabolism, was associated
with 508 patients with the word string ‘elevated triglycerides’
(P=4.2E—5), whereas r512678919 genotype was associated with
322 patients diagnosed with pure hyperglyceridemia (P: 1.4E-4).
The correlation between cases and controls for this example was
0.35 with 67% of cases unique only to text data and 48% of cases
unique only to ICD9 data (Table 1). This result may suggest that
neither text data, nor ICD9 coding, can comprehensively identify all
cases. Improvement in a text—based phenome may be achieved by
implementing concept identification approaches, such as negation
analysis, word sense disambiguation, and abbreviation expansion.
Furthermore, further improvement may be achieved by combining
different data types.

In conclusion, this study demonstrates for the first time that raw
text data from clinical notes in an EHR system can be used effect—
ively to define a phenome. This study also validates that clinical text
data, including drug data, can be applied to PheWAS as a comple—
mentary approach to a GWAS and ICD9—based PheWAS. The future
of the PheWAS strategy may not be limited to either clinical text
data or ICD9 coding. A potential name for this approach might be
called a text—wide association study (TextWAS). The future of the
PheWAS strategy may rely on multiple structured and unstructured
data types. This is particularly relevant as EHR systems become
standardized, bio—repositories continue to grow and genomic medi—
cine becomes widely applied.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: DNA methylation is a heritable modifiable chemical pro-
cess that affects gene transcription and is associated with other mo-
lecular markers (e.g. gene expression) and biomarkers (e.g. cancer or
other diseases). Current technology measures methylation in hundred
of thousands, or millions of CpG sites throughout the genome. It is
evident that neighboring CpG sites are often highly correlated with
each other, and current literature suggests that clusters of adjacent
CpG sites are co-regulated.

Results: We develop the Adjacent Site Clustering (A-clustering) algo-
rithm to detect sets of neighboring CpG sites that are correlated with
each other. To detect methylation regions associated with exposure,
we propose an analysis pipeline for high-dimensional methylation data
in which CpG sites within regions identified by A-clustering are mod-
eled as multivariate responses to environmental exposure using a
generalized estimating equation approach that assumes exposure
equally affects all sites in the cluster. We develop a correlation pre-
serving simulation scheme, and study the proposed methodology via
simulations. We study the clusters detected by the algorithm on high
dimensional dataset of peripheral blood methylation of pesticide
applicators.

Availability: We provide the R package Aclust that efficiently imple-
ments the A-clustering and the analysis pipeline, and produces ana-
lysis reports. The package is found on http://www.hsph.harvard.edu/

1 INTRODUCTION

Methylation is a heritable and modiﬁable chemical process by
which, most often, a methyl group attaches to a cytosine base
that is followed by guanine on the same DNA strand (CpG
dinucleotide, or CpG site). It is sensitive to environmental

exposure, such as smoking, air pollution and chemicals (Anttila
et al., 2003; Hou et al., 2012; Sofer et al., 2013). Modern array-
based platforms measure methylation in hundreds of thousands
of CpG sites, and sequencing methods measure methylation in
millions of sites. Methylation is often measured as a continuous
variable known as a ,8 value, representing the proportion of
methylated CpG sites out of the total in the measured tissue.
Interestingly, sets of related-by-location CpG sites, whether asso-
ciated with a gene or not, may be jointly affected by environ-
mental exposure. It is of interest to identify such sets of CpG sites
that are affected by an exposure in a computationally efﬁcient
and quick manner.

Methylation occurs throughout the genome, and it differs be-
tween tissues and cell types. Although it is known that methyla-
tion is associated with the control of genes, the mechanisms are
still debated (Jones, 2012). The distribution of CpG sites varies
across the genome. Areas densely populated with CpG sites are
called CpG islands [CGIs; Gardiner-Garden et a]. (1987)]. CGIs
are often found in the promoter area of genes, and they exhibit
low methylation. Higher CGI methylation is associated with
gene silencing. Within gene bodies, CpG sites are usually hyper-
methylated, and are found in lower density. However, there are
many exceptions to these general rules, such as CGIs within gene
bodies or promoter areas without CGIs. There are other, prede-
ﬁned, regions associated with CGIs. In addition to the island
itself, there are north and south shores and shelves, located up-
and downstream from the island, respectively, and are deﬁned
according to their distance (in base pairs) from the island
(Irizarry et al., 2009; Sandoval et al., 2011). Shores are up to
2kb of the island, and shelves are within 241 kb of the islands.
We term the collection of shelves, shores and island associated
with a single CGI by a ‘resort’ to eliminate confusion. The def-
inition of these regions is independent of any actual observed
behavior of the sets of associated CpG sites. Further, Jacoby
et a]. (2012) report ﬁnding clusters of methylated CpG sites
within speciﬁc cell types, these clusters are not related to CGIs.
In other words, these regions do not necessarily correspond to
regions that are co-regulated. Therefore, it is useful to employ
computational tools for discovery of regions with CpG sites

exhibiting common behavior that are not necessarily restricted to
the known predeﬁned methylation domains.

This article has three aspects: (i) automated identiﬁcation of
methylation regions based on the correlation between methyla-
tion sites, and independently of any exposure data; (ii) analysis of
these regions to identify those affected by exposure; and (iii)
development of a realistic correlation-preserving simulation
scheme for methylation data. Jaffe et a]. (2012) proposed a
method to identify regions that are associated with exposure.
Our proposed method differs from their work in that we perform
general region detection, pose different modeling assumptions on
the exposure effect on a region and, as a result, provide a simpler
testing procedure. Others used the correlation for analysis of
genetic data, more speciﬁcally, data from tiling arrays in which
adjacent probes target overlapping sequences. For instance,
Kuan et a]. (2008) developed a software package to correct the
P—values associated with a probe using the estimated correlation
between the probe and neighboring probes. Pedersen et a]. (2012)
developed a software package, applying methods to combine
adjacent correlated P—values and detect regions of low P—value.
These methods identify differentially methylation regions
(DMRs) after testing for the exposure effect on the methylation
sites, while we ﬁrst cluster sites, and then test for the exposure
effect on the clusters. Wu et a]. (2010) proposed a method to
detect CGIs using a Hidden Markov Model. However, their
work focuses on redeﬁning CGIs to alleviate limitations of the
traditional deﬁnition based on CpG content in an interval, rather
than on identifying regions of common behavior of CpG sites. In
terms of simulation, Jaffe et a]. (2012) did perform some simu-
lations, but our proposed simulation scheme better imitates the
reality, by preserving the correlation structure and methylation
patterns of a real dataset.

In what follows, we present an adjacent sites clustering
method, dubbed A-clustering, to discover methylation regions
by clustering together neighboring CpG sites according to their
correlation, and under possible restrictions on their distance
from each other on the DNA. The clustering can be preceded
by a dbp-merge step, an algorithm that merges a set of methy-
lation sites wedged between two highly correlated CpG sites, that
are physically located close enough to each other along a
chromosome. This combination of the dbp-merge and A-cluster-
ing detects regions of co-regulated CpG sites. We further provide
a pipeline for analysis after normalization and batch correction
are performed that ﬁrst includes clustering CpG sites, and then
tests the effect of exposure on each cluster. For testing, we
assume that the exposure equally affects all CpG sites, while
each site has its own baseline methylation level. We perform
this analysis using generalized estimating equations (GEES;
Liang and Zeger, 1986) that are robust to the speciﬁcation of
data distribution. The clustering method and the following GEE
analysis are implemented in the R package Aclust.

The article is organized as follows: in Section 2, we present the
model at the basis of this work. Section 3 describes the A-clus-
tering and dbp-merge algorithms, the proposed analysis pipeline
and an abbreviated description of the correlation-preserving
simulation scheme (complete details may be found in the
Supplementary Material). In Section 4, we ﬁrst study the per-
formance of the proposed analysis pipeline for ﬁnding regions
associated with the exposure, via an extensive simulation study

with different implementations of the A-clustering algorithm and
a subsequent sensitivity analysis. We then compare the analysis
pipeline with the Bump Hunting method of Jaffe et a]. (2012) as
well as brieﬂy review single-site analysis results. We then com-
pare clustering results between two implementation options of
the A-clustering and dbp-merge on a dataset of peripheral blood
methylation of pesticide applicators. We conclude with discus-
sion in Section 5.

2 MODEL

Suppose there are i: l,...,n subjects with j: l,...,m sites
with measured methylation. Denote the exposure measure of
subject 1' by E,, and the l X p vector of covariates of subject 1'
by xiT. We model the methylation of a site j as a linear function of
exposure and covariates, according to

yyzﬂj—l—Eiﬂg—l—xfﬁxj—l—ey, i=l,...,n,j=l,...,m,

where this is a general model that lets the jth site have a unique
baseline methylation value ,8], as well as unique exposure effect
ﬁg and covariates’ effects ﬁxj on its methylation level. The vector
of covariates xiT includes biological covariates. Note that it can
potentially include confounders and technical biases, such as
variables derived using a Surrogate Variables Analysis (SVA)
procedure (Leek and Storey, 2007), but in this article we limit
the discussion to the clustering and association analysis and as-
sume that technical biases were already removed from the data.

We assume that there are sets or regions of sites, i.e. clusters of
methylation sites, such that their methylation values are corre-
lated with each other. The correlation can be attributable to
underlying unknown or unaccountable biological mechanisms,
so that exposure effect of sites within these clusters is constant.
For example, let yl , y2 and y3 belong to the same cluster, or set of
correlated sites. Then,

yUZIBj+EiIBE+xiTﬁxj+€U= i=1=m=n=j=1=2=3=

where ,BE is the common exposure effect on the methylation in
the three sites, and 61,253 ~.7-"(0, 2) for some mean zero distribu-
tion .7: with a 3 X 3 covariance matrix 2.

3 METHODS

In this section, we describe the computational methods, the clustering
algorithms and analysis pipeline and the correlation-preserving simula-
tion scheme.

3.1 Computational methods

The proposed epigenome-wide analysis is composed of two steps. At the
ﬁrst step, we identify clusters of correlated methylation sites using the
Adjacent sites algorithm (‘A-clustering’, or shortly ‘Aclust’), and at
the second step, we test these clusters for association with exposure (or
outcome) using GEES. We expand here on each of these steps.

The ﬁrst step is clustering of adjacent correlated CpG sites. The pro-
posed clustering algorithm, Aclust, is similar to the agglomerative nesting
clustering algorithm (Izenman, 2008). However, it is restricted so that
only probes that are adjacent to each other (i.e. next to each other
along the chromosome) could be clustered together, or, more generally,
only neighboring clusters could be merged to form a larger single cluster.
In general, the clustering is performed by cycling through the sites,

ordered by location, and merging together neighboring clusters if the
distance measure between them is smaller than a predeﬁned threshold
5. Here, the ‘distance measure’ is a similarity metric that depends on the
actual methylation values observed in the sample. The distance measure
between two clusters depends on the distances between probes in the
cluster. The distance between two probes is deﬁned by any general
distance measure, where in our approach we recommend using the

correlation-based distance measure:
dist(site,-,Sitej) = 1 — cor(site,-,Sitej),

where correlation could be Pearson or Spearman correlation, for
instance. Then, the distance between two clusters could be deﬁned as
either the single, average or complete distance between sites in the cor-
responding two clusters. To merge two clusters, if the single distance type
is used, then it sufﬁces to have one site in each cluster, such that they are
closer to each other by at least D. The average type requires the mean
distance between all sites in the two clusters to be at most 5, and the
complete type requires the distance between every pair of sites in the two
clusters to be at most D. Note that for a ﬁxed threshold 5, if the complete
distance is used, then the clusters will be smaller than those created by
using the average distance, which in turn will yield smaller clusters than
the single distance. It is noteworthy that the clustering results are some-
what sensitive to the order of the clustering (e.g. starting from the ﬁrst
versus last location). In practice, these differences are expected to be
minor. Pseudocode for the algorithm is given in Supplementary
Material. Aclust potentially limits CpG sites from clustering, by specify-
ing 67b1,, a maximal distance between two neighboring CpG sites to be
clustered together. For instance, if 671,1, 2 1000, one may not allow for two
CpG sites that are 1000 base pairs away that are without any other CpG
site(s) in the middle to cluster together.

A-clustering is applied on an initial vector of cluster assignments (and
a data matrix), so that only adjacent clusters can be merged at each step.
An extension of this algorithm is motivated by the two following argu-
ments. First, as was implied so far, these initial cluster assignments are the
numbers {1, 2,. . . , m} where m is the number of sites, so that if the data
from chromosome 4, say, consists of a measured methylation site on the
1000, 1200, 1500 and 3000 chromosomal base-pair locations, than these
four sites are initially assigned with cluster 1, cluster 2, cluster 3 and
cluster 4. Note that the physical distance between the measured sites is
variable, and does not necessarily represent the complete set of sites in the
stretch of chromosomal locations 1—3000 in chromosome 4, so that there
may be additional, non-measured, methylation sites. Moreover, site 1 and
site 3 are physically closer to each other than site 3 and site 4. Second,
examinations of correlation plots (Fig. 1) reveal that some clusters are
seemingly the composite of smaller clusters, close to each other, but with
a few sites between these small clusters that evidently are not-highly
correlated with their neighbors. For instance, looking at the correlation
of a set of sites along a chromosome, one can see a pattern of [cluster of 5
probes, uncorrelated probe, cluster of 4 probes, many uncorrelated
probes], where members of the 5-probe and 4-probe clusters are highly
correlated with each other.

Therefore, we extend the Aclust algorithm by adding a more ﬂexible
initiation step. We initialize with a ‘d-base—pair-merge’, or dbp-merge.
The dbp-merge is an algorithm that can be performed before Aclust, in
which all sites are scanned, and each is potentially merged into a cluster
with another site k 5 4,, base pairs away from it, and with all the sites
wedged in between these two if the distance measure between them is
small. For instance, set 41,}, = 999, and consider CpG sites in locations
1000, 1200 and 1500, for sites 1—3, respectively, and the distance measure
between them are dist(site1, sitez) = 0.7, and dist(site1, site3) = 0.3. Then,
for D 2 0.3, even though sitel and sitez are not similar to each other (as
determined by the distance measure), because sitel and site3 are similar to
each other, and the base-pair distance between them is 500, which is
smaller than dbp, then the three CpG sites will be merged to a single

mented using ‘Spearman’ as the distance measure, and single distance
type. The axes’ labels represent the location on the chromosome 7, plus

cluster. Notice that this algorithm is aimed at merging sites rather than
clusters. The dbp-merge step results in an initial clustering assignment,
which is then complemented by the Aclust algorithm. The dbp-merge
pseudocode is provided in the Supplementary Material.

After deﬁning clusters of probes, whether with or without an initial
dbp-merge step, a ﬁnal step of the analysis, if desired, tests for the effect
of exposure on the detected clusters of methylation sites, where one can
choose the minimum cluster sizes, say two or three sites per cluster. We ﬁt
a GEE model assuming common exposure and covariate effects
(including possible batch effects) on all sites within a cluster and an in-
dividual location effect for each site, as described in Section 2. Note that
if batch effect was previously removed, such as with ComBat (Johnson
et al., 2007), there is no need to further adjust for batch. The raw P-value
is then the P-value of the exposure variable from the GEE model. We use
the robust sandwich variance estimator in our computations. Note that
GEES are performed under less assumptions than regression or mixed
model analyses, as only a marginal mean model is assumed. As such, a
working covariance structure must be provided, but is allowed to be mis-
speciﬁed. After producing raw P-values for each of the clusters, we cor-
rect for multiple testing using existing procedures, such as by control of
the false-discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3.2 Simulating methylation data

We adapt the strategy of Gaile et a]. (2007) to generate (spatial) correl-
ation-preserved methylation data via sampling from a real methylation
dataset. More speciﬁcally, we consider the comparison of methylation ,8
values for two subgroups (e. g. low and high exposure). Simulated datasets
consist of methylation assay ,8 values for )1 =40 samples from each sub-
group, where assignment of methylation ,8 values to the simulated sam-
ples is designed to preserve the true correlation structure within regional
blocks of dense array coverage (described in greater detail below). The
number of samples in each subgroup, and their deﬁnitions of high and
low exposure groups, mimics the dataset we analyze (Section 4.2).

3.2.] Description Of data The dataset on which the simulations were
based consists of batch-corrected methylation ,8 values for 1299 x 105
breast invasive adenocarcinoma samples obtained from The Cancer
Genome Atlas; speciﬁc dataset descriptions are provided in the
Supplementary Material. These 539 samples were assayed with the
Illumina 450K array and provide estimates of 485577 ,8 methylation
values located across the genome. We performed two simulation studies.
First, we focused on chromosome 1, and simulated M = 5 differentially
methylated clusters. We used this simulation to study different combin-
ations of the Aclust parameters, and choose the most ﬁtting parameters.

A-clustering

 

Then, we conducted epigenome-wide association study (EWAS) simula-
tions with M = 10 differentially methylated clusters, in which Aclust was
implemented using the parameters settings selected in the chromosome 1
simulations.

3.2.2 Assigning samples to exposure groups We conduct 100 simu-
lations, where in each simulation we derive a simulated dataset from the
original N = 539 samples. Consider ﬁrst a single chromosome. A simu-
lated dataset was constructed by preferentially resampling pre—speciﬁed
‘regional blocks’ (deﬁned below) of the chromosome based on methyla-
tion values at the locations of M putative ‘targets’. The sites selected to
serve as ‘targets’ satisfy three properties: (i) evidence of a substantial
variability in methylation ,8 values in the original 539 samples, (ii) evi-
dence of substantial correlations with neighboring sites (c0r>.5 for at
least two neighbors) within the same regional block across the original
539 samples, and (iii) none of the M targets could be located within the
same regional block. Note that although the preferential resampling to be
described below focuses on single targets, owing to the correlation struc-
ture among neighboring sites, the entire correlated ‘cluster’ will be asso-
ciated with exposure. For a whole epigenome simulation, a single dataset
is composed of all simulated chromosomes, sampled independently of one
another. Correlation heatmaps of the targets and associated clusters used
in simulations are provided in the Supplementary Material.

We created regional blocks by partitioning each chromosome by deﬁn-
ing breakpoints in areas of low array/site coverage. Speciﬁcally, break-
points were formed between adjacent sites >10 K bp apart. For instance,
in chromosome 1 there were 30 796 sites (after quality control) and 2861
regional blocks. Thus, contiguous portions of a chromosome that were
densely assayed are grouped within the same regional block so that the
any spatial correlation existing in these dense areas will be preserved
during the resampling process.

To create each of the 2n samples within a simulated dataset, each of
the regional blocks is sampled independently of each other, but the M
regional blocks containing the targets are preferentially resampled to
force differences in methylation between groups at the target and its
associated cluster. Note that the regional block is sampled as a unit, so
that all sites within a regional block sample travel together. Hence, in
practice, we sample each regional block without replacement from the set
of N ‘block samples’ for that particular region. Brieﬂy, for each target, we
assign n = 40 regional block samples containing the target (‘target block
samples’, henceforth) to the high exposure group (group H) by sampling
from the original N = 539 target block samples, with the sampling
probability of each target block sample as a function of its target’s
ranked methylation level (rH) and a selection weight (w>0) as
(1 — rH/(N + 1))’”. From the remaining N — n = 499 target block sam-
ples, we assign n=40 target block samples with sampling probabilities
(rL / (N — n + 1))w to the low exposure group, group L, where rL is the
rank of the target’s methylation value with respect to the remaining 499
target methylation values not assigned to group H. The weight w controls
the magnitude of differential methylation between groups H and L. For
example, if w = 1, it is likely that the samples with the highest and lowest
,8 values for the target will be assigned to different groups. As w decreases
toward 0, the sampling becomes less biased, so that each group consists of
target block samples with a mix of both high and low methylation
,8 values at the target. For this simulation, the weight w was tuned
such that the average value (across 1000 simulations) of single-site stat-
istics matched typical ‘high signal’ sites. We speciﬁcally targeted Wald
statistics such that the mean (across 1000 simulations) single-site
(unadjusted) P—values were approximately 0.001.

Finally, each of the remaining regional blocks not containing a target
need to be assigned to each of the 2n samples within the simulated dataset
to ‘complete’ the chromosome. For each of these regional blocks, we
randomly selected 2n = 80 block samples of the given region from the
original N = 539 block samples of that region with equal probability, and
assigned n to each exposure group. Thus, each sample within a simulated

dataset is a composite of the N = 539 original samples, with regional
blocks containing the target preferentially resampled so that the two
groups are differentially methylated at the target. As a consequence of
the locally preserved spatial correlation within regional blocks, the
target’s neighboring sites will be differentially methylated, as well.
The complete algorithm and more speciﬁc details are provided in the
Supplementary Material.

4 RESULTS

4.1 Simulation results

We ﬁrst performed Simulations uSing 100 datasets sampled from
chromosome 1 data. We Simulated M = 5 differentially methy-
lated clusters. We analyzed the data using a comprehensive set of
parameter settings of Aclust and the ensuing GEE analySiS, two
implementations of Bump Hunting (using function dmrFind in
R package charm; Aryee et al., 2011) and a more traditional
Single-Site analySiS. The goal in these Simulations waS 3-fold:
compare the proposed pipeline to other analyses, study itS
robustness for parameter Speciﬁcation and identify optimal par-
ameters settings to use in data analySiS. Then, we carried out an
EWAS Simulations with M = 10 differentially methylated clus-
terS and compared the proposed pipeline, with Aclust imple-
mented using the parameters previously identiﬁed, and Bump
Hunting. We ﬁrst describe and report chromosome 1 results,
and then the EWAS results.

4.1.] Chromosome 1 simulation study A major goal of these
Simulations waS to study the appropriateness of the various
Aclust parameters for an analySiS that iS focused on the identi-
ﬁcation of differentially methylated clusters, and ﬁnd the ‘best’
parameters. Therefore, we analyzed each of the Simulated
datasets with all combinations of the following parameter Speci-
ﬁcations: Pearson or Spearman correlation, with _or without
999-dbp-merge initiation, with and without 1000 dbp distance
restriction for merging, Single, average or complete clustering
type, and distance threshold T? = 0.25. From these Simulations
we concluded that 1000 dbp distance restriction iS beneﬁcial, and
that either average or complete clustering type iS more appropri-
ate than the Single for the purpose of identiﬁcation of DMRS.
Note, however, that overall the results are robust for different
Speciﬁcations of the parameters, which iS reassuring. The results
of these Simulations are provided in the Supplementary Material,
including comparison to Single-Site analySiS and to Bump
Hunting.

Then, we performed a sensitivity analySiS stage for these Simu-
lations. For each combination of Pearson and Spearman correl-
ationS, types average and complete and with and without
999-dbp-merge, we varied the value of T? as {0.05,0.l, . . . ,0.5}
and chose the most performant T? for each setting. Table 1
reports the analySiS results based on each of the above combin-
ationS with the matching (identiﬁed) TD, and compares them to
the results of Bump Hunting. The complete sensitivity analySiS
results, parameter Speciﬁcations used for Bump Hunting and
correlation heatmaps for the neighborhoods around the targets
are included in the Supplementary Material.

For each Aclust method, Table 1 provides the number of
detected clusters of 3 or more members (not necessarily differen-
tially methylated). For Bump Hunting, thiS measure iS not

N ote: Results of the proposed analysis pipeline based on different parameters of the Aclust algorithm, and the more performant implementation of Bump Hunting. Aclust and
d+Aclust stand A-clustering without (Aclust) and with (d+Aclust) 999-dbp-merge initiation step. 1000 £71,], restriction was always applied. The numbers in parentheses are
the distance thresholds D used in each clustering implementation. These thresholds are the optimal ones for each settings, as determined by sensitivity analysis described in the
Supplementary Material. Cluster provides the total number of detected clusters by Aclust. Memb m is the mean number of members in the mth cluster, and TPR m is the
proportion of Simulations in which the mth cluster was found to be Signiﬁcantly associated with the exposure after FDR correction. TPR is the proportion of Simulations in
which all ﬁve clusters were associated with exposure, and FF is the mean number of clusters that were falsely detected as associated with exposure. Time is the elapsed

computation time (in seconds).

provided because it searches DMRS, rather than performs clus-
tering and then association analySiS, aS the proposed pipeline.
For Aclust, we say that a cluster waS detected if the Benjamini
and Hochberg (BH)-adjusted (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)
exposure effect P—value <0.05 from the GEE analySiS. For
Bump Hunting, a cluster waS detected if itS q-value waS <0.05.
The true-positive rate of target m (TPR m) iS deﬁned aS the
proportion of Simulations in which a cluster containing target
m waS detected. The TPR iS deﬁned aS the proportion of Simu-
lationS in which clusters containing all M = 5 targets were de-
tected. Finally, the false-positive (FP) rate iS the mean number of
non-target clusters detected across Simulations. We also report
the mean number of members in the mth cluster in each scenario
(‘Memb m’) and the mean elapsed computation time (in seconds)
for the analySiS (Time).

Comparing TPRS across the different implementations of
Aclust, the results are consistent, with the largest difference
seen in cluster 1, with the lowest TPRl being 0.61 and the highest
0.71. ThiS difference iS seen in the two implementations of Aclust
using Pearson correlation and type average. Notice that Specif-
ically in thiS cluster, there waS a relatively large ﬂuctuation, of
about 2, in the estimated number of members across Aclust Spe-
ciﬁcations. Spearman correlation yielded overall larger TPRS,
and also Slightly larger FPS, but still the mean FPS are small,
so that Spearman correlation seems to be more appropriate, eS-
pecially when the dbp-merge initiation iS used. When using both
Pearson and Spearman correlations, and initiating with the
dbp-merge, the average and complete clusteringS gave almost
identical results. Because the computation time of the average
clustering iS lower, thiS Simulations study leadS uS to conclude
that average clustering type iS preferable.

AS compared with the results from A-clustering, our imple-
mentation of Bump Hunting tended to detect leSS true differen-
tially methylated clusters, Slightly leSS FF and itS computation
time iS longer. Interestingly, Bump Hunting performed well on
large clusters, but leSS so on smaller clusters. Taken aS a whole,
the results of A-clustering tend to be robust to the implementa-
tion Speciﬁcations that we considered, and are competitive with
the Bump Hunting method.

We brieﬂy summarize the Single Site comparisons here. Each of
the SiteS along chromosome l was tested for differential methy-
lation using Wald testS with robust standard error estimates.
The resulting P—valueS were adjusted according to one of two
methods: BH FDR (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and
Benjamini-Yekutieli FDR, which controls the FDR of SiteS
under dependency (Benjamini and Yekutieli, 2001). A Site waS
detected if itS adjusted P—value <0.05. To make the results com-
parable with the clusterS/DMRS-based analyses, deﬁne TPR m in
the Single Site analySiS aS the proportion of Simulations including
at least one Site detected within the cluster containing target m,
and Similarly TPR iS the proportion of Simulations in which at
least one Site waS detected in all M target clusters. Deﬁne FPR aS
the proportion of Simulations with detected SiteS not belonging to
clusters containing any of the targets. The best TPR observed in
the Single-Site analySiS (i.e. across the different Aclust implemen-
tations) waS 0.2, lower than any TPR reported in Table 1. The
corresponding FPR waS 0.7, higher than any of the clustering
FPS in Table 1. We conclude that the Single Site analySiS iS leSS
powerful then the clustering-based analysis; refer to the
Supplementary Material for more details.

for chromosome 1 Simulations, to allow for more scenarios. The
correlation heatmaps for neighborhoods surrounding these tar-
getS are provided in the Supplementary Material. We compared
the proposed pipeline, with the ‘best’ Aclust parameters settings
from chromosome 1 Simulations, with Bump Hunting. (The
‘best’ setti_ngs: Spearman correlation, average clustering type,
D = 0.2, dbp = 1000 and 999-dbp-merge initiation). AS in the
other Simulations, the minimum cluster Size waS set to 3.
Table 2 gives a brief summary of the Simulations with three re-
ported measures: the average number of true-positive detections
across 100 Simulations (here the maximum number iS 10) and
the average number of FF detections, or average number of clus-
terS detected that are not in fact DMRS, and computation time
(Time). More detailed results are reported in the Supplementary
Material.

4.2 Data analysis

We applied the proposed clustering algorithm and analySiS
pipeline to data generated from a NIH-funded RC1 grant
(lRClES01846l-01) studying genome-wide methylation alter-
ationS in response to pesticide exposure uSing the Illumina
Inﬁmum 450K beadchip. The data we used for our analySiS in
the present investigation were produced from 80 certiﬁed, white
male US pesticide applicators. The exposure waS deﬁned aS high
versus low exposure to pesticides. There were 40 subjects in each
exposure group. Before application of the A-clustering and sub-
sequent analySiS, the dataset waS preprocessed by applying the
pipeline proposed in Touleimat and Tost (2012). CpG SiteS in the
proximity of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPS) (up to
10 bp away) of minor allele frequency at least 0.05 were removed.
The data were corrected for batch effect uSing empirical Bayes
correction [ComBat, Johnson et al. (2007)].

We now describe the results of two clustering and analyses
applied to the entire dataset. In the ﬁrst analySiS, we used the
settings identiﬁed aS optimal for the purpose of detection of
DMRS in the Simulations studies, and in the second analySiS,
we used leSS stringent distance criteria to both glean into the
differences in the results, and also learn about the clustering
outcomes themselves.

4.3 Clustering results

There were 460 337 CpG SiteS in the data used for analySiS. We
applied the A-clustering algorithm on the dataset twice. In the
ﬁrst analySiS, we applied A-clustering with the settings identiﬁed
in Simulations aS most appropriate to detect DMRS, i.e.
Spearman correlation-based distance measure, average distance
type, threshold distance for merging D = 0.2, dbp-merge initi-
ation (999 bp) and 1000 bp restriction on merging of adjacent
CpG SiteS. Table 3 summarizes the results of thiS analySiS.
There were 7741 clusters with at least two CpG SiteS, with the
largest cluster having 52 SiteS. Seventy percent of clusters were
associated with a predeﬁned CpG resort, and of these, 20% had
SiteS from multiple resort regions (e.g. both iSland and north
Shore), suggesting that SiteS in different resort regions are in
fact functionally associated. At the bottom part of Table 3, we
provide characteristics of clusters with estimated exposure effect
Size larger than 0.02, and are also Signiﬁcant at the 0.05 level
after FDR correction for multiple hypotheSiS testing. We

restricted the effect Size to be at least 0.02 because we cannot
exclude the possibility that smaller effect SizeS are due to changes
in cell mixture composition (Houseman et al., 2012). There were
402 clusters with effect Size >0.02, and four of them were Sig-
niﬁcantly associated with exposure. Three of them had only two
CpG SiteS, and the fourth had three. The SiteS were rather close
to each other: two of the clusters had only 6 and 7bp between
extreme SiteS. One of these clusters contained 2 probes from a
CGI, another cluster contained 3 probes from a north Shore and
another cluster contained 1 probe from an iSland and 1 probe
from a north Shore.

In the second analySiS (Table 4), we applied the A-clustering
with leSS stringent distance criteria: thiS time the distance type
waS Single, and D = 0.5. Other settings remained the same. Now,
there were 17515 clusters of at least two SiteS, with the largest
cluster having 59 SiteS. Seventy-two percent of the clusters had at
least one Site from a resort and of these, 29% of SiteS from more
than one region in a resort, a higher proportion than the equiva-
lent number in the previous analySiS (20% there). There were 641
clusters with estimated exposure effect Size >0.02. Applying
FDR correction for multiple testing, seven of these clusters

Four of these clusters had only two SiteS, and the others had 3, 4
and 7 SiteS. Four of these clusters had at least one CpG Site from
a CpG resort, while two of these had CpG SiteS from both an
iSland and a north Shore. Comparing the clusters identiﬁed aS
DMRS by the ﬁrst analySiS with those in the second analySiS, the
top three clusters detected in the ﬁrst (average distance type,
D = 0.2) analySiS where in the top ﬁve clusters identiﬁed in the
second (distance type Single, D = 0.5) analySiS. The fourth clus-
ter waS not identiﬁed aS a DMR in the second analySiS at all, and
in fact, there it waS part of a larger cluster of ﬁve SiteS, with a
smaller effect Size.

We also performed the same analySiS while restricting to three
SiteS in a cluster, aS in the Simulations. In thiS case there waS only
one cluster, of three SiteS, identiﬁed aS a DMR when average
clustering and D = 0.2 were used, and four clusters, of 3—7 SiteS,
were identiﬁed aS DMRS when Single and D = 0.5 were used.

Finally, we implemented the Bump Hunting algorithm to
detect DMRS. In Short, Bump Hunting, allowing for a minimum
of two SiteS per DMR, and other settings used in the Simulations
suggested 452 potential DMR, but the lowest q-value waS 0.18,
i.e. none were determined aS Signiﬁcantly associated with expos-
ure. ThiS iS consistent with the Simulations that Showed that
Bump Hunting performs well with large clusters, but doeS not
easily detect small clusters.

5 DISCUSSION

We present the A-clustering algorithm that clusters together ad-
jacent methylation SiteS according to their distance, usually
derived from the correlation between them, and provide a pipe-
line for analySiS of methylation data when they are treated aS
outcomes. The clustering iS used both to detect regions of SiteS
that are co-regulated, and also to reduce dimension, by forming a

smaller set of analySiS unitS. We demonstrated the use of the
algorithm on a methylation dataset, in which methylation waS
measured using the Illumina Inﬁmum 450 K beadchip. The pro-
posed method iS also appropriate for sequencing data, possibly
even more so than for array data, which tend to be Sparser. The
clustering and analySiS methods are efﬁcient, and they do not
require resampling methods to compute the P—valueS.

It iS still an open question regarding what iS the ‘right’ unit of
analySiS and for which purposes (e. g. CGIS, Shores). Recent work
by J acoby et al. (2012) suggests that the unit of analySiS differS by
regions (e. g. in promoter or intragenic areas), and possibly by cell
type aS well. A-clustering iS useful tool in studying such unitS of
differentially methylated regions and loci. Clusters of methyla-
tion SiteS will often have higher P—valueS then individual methy-
lation SiteS. For instance, the cluster will likely have a smaller
effect estimate and a larger P—value than the Site within the clus-
ter with the largest effect. However, there iS a considerable di-
mension reduction when clusters are considered, and further, we
believe that the fact that multiple SiteS exhibit Similar behavior
increases our certainty that the effect iS ‘real’, rather than a FP
discovery, because the probability to detect multiple adjacent
SiteS iS lower than the probability of detecting at least one
Single Site.

A-clustering useS correlation aS the baSiS for clustering of CpG
SiteS. ThiS raises a few issues that are important to consider when
analyzing data. First, the type of correlation to use. We explored
the use of Pearson correlation, aS well aS the Spearman correl-
ation, which iS more robust to non-linearitieS in the association
between two variables. In the dataset we used for data analySiS,
aS well aS the Simulated data, we had 80 observations, a relatively
low number, and, aS waS determined by Simulations, Spearman
correlation waS Slightly more appropriate for the detection of
differentially methylated regions. When the number of observa-
tionS iS higher, it may be beneﬁcial to use the Pearson correl-
ation, especially because it reduces computation time compared
with Spearman correlation. Second, one Should consider redun-
dant correlation due to covariateS and batch effects. We recom-
mend performing the entire analySiS after normalization and
batch effect removal, but one Should also consider correcting
for the effects of important covariateS before A-clustering, by
implementing Aclust on the partial residuals of the methylation
measures, after regressing them on covariateS. Note, however,
that in our dataset, clustering results were nearly identical
when we used the methylation values and when we used the
partial residuals. Third, one can apply A-clustering based on a
subset of the subjects. For instance, one can use only the high-
exposure group to deﬁne the clusters, rather than all subjects.
ThiS would be useful if one expects that high exposure will ‘ac-
tivate’ a region, say, so that the Signal iS completely driven by the
high-exposure group. AS another example, it may be advanta-
geous to cluster methylation SiteS based on the controls in a case-
control study, if one expects that cases will exhibit an aberrant
methylation pattern.

We provide two options to extend and restrict the clustering
algorithm. First, the dbp-merge that allows one to cluster a set of
SiteS that are wedged between two correlated SiteS and are ‘close
enough’ to each other, in termS of both correlation-based and
physical distance. We also consider restricting adjacent CpG SiteS
from clusters, if the base-pair distance between them (and

without any CpG Site measured between them) iS smaller than a
predetermined threshold. In the data analySiS, we used 999 bp for
the dbp merge and 1000 bp for the base-pair distance restriction.
It iS not entirely clear if these are the best numbers. The best
distances would be such that the Signal iS maximized and yet not
too much noise iS added. More complex ruleS for merging and
restrictions could also be devised, but that can lead to more
complicated computation and leSS clear interpretation. Another
possible extension to the clustering algorithm iS the use of clus-
tering indicators based on prior knowledge. For instance, one
can decide that an iSland necessarily belongs to a certain cluster.
Also, in validating the results of one study on a different dataset,
one can use the clustering assignments from the ﬁrst study.

Another tuning parameter iS the type of distance between clus-
terS to be used. In the Simulations, mimicking the sample Size and
two exposure group’s design of our dataset, we found that the
average distance iS most appropriate for the goal of detecting
differentially methylated regions.

We use GEES for the analySiS of clusters, aS they use marginal
mean models that are robust to miS-Speciﬁcation of correlation
structure. We use exchangeable working correlation, but other
types of correlation can be explored. Also, we assumed that the
exposure effect iS constant across all SiteS in the cluster. Although
it iS likely that the direction of exposure effect (increases/decrease
methylation) iS the same across the cluster, it iS not clear that the
constant effect iS correct and therefore, it may not be the most
advantageous assumption. For instance, it may be that even after
allowing for Single-Site intercept (i.e. we allowed for a different
baseline level of methylation for each Site), some SiteS may be
more quickly modiﬁed by exposure than others. It iS a topic for
future work to extend the method using other assumptions on
the effect of exposure on methylation in SiteS (e.g. increasing aS
the Site iS closer to the transcriptional start Site). A drawback of
the proposed GEE-based analySiS iS limited detection of large
clusters (e.g. 50 SiteS) when the sample Size iS small. Allowing
for different intercept for each Site in a cluster may yield high
standard errors for the exposure effect. ThuS, in the case of a
large cluster and small sample Size, it iS possible that methods
such aS Bump Hunting, or analySiS of the mean methylation
measure of probes in the cluster, may be more powerful.

Abstract

With the emergence of large—scale Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) datasets from individ—
ual labs and the FANTOM consortium, one can now analyze the cis—regulatory regions associated
with gene transcription at an unprecedented level of refinement. By coupling transcription factor
binding site (TFBS) enrichment analysis with CAGE—derived genomic regions, CAGEd—oPOSSUM
can identify TFs that act as key regulators of genes involved in specific mammalian cell and tissue
types. The webtool allows for the analysis of CAGE—derived transcription start sites (TSSs) either
provided by the user or selected from ~1300 mammalian samples from the FANTOM5 project with
pre—computed TFBS predicted with JASPAR TF binding profiles. The tool helps power insights into
the regulation of genes through the study of the specific usage of TSSs within specific cell types
and/or under specific conditions.

Availability and Implementation: The CAGEd—oPOSUM web tool is implemented in Perl, MySQL
and Apache and is available at http://cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca/CAGEd_oPOSSU M.

1 Introduction

 

The Cap Analysis of Gene Expression (CAGE) technology
(Kanamori—Katayama et 61]., 2011) has revolutionized our capacity
to analyze the promoter and enhancer regions—the cis—regulatory
regions—that are active in cell types and tissues at specific time—
points. Over 1 X 106 human and 6 X 105 mouse CAGE peaks were
identified through the FANTOM5 project (The FANTOM
Consortium, 2014; Lizio et 61]., 2015), providing both the precise lo—
cation of transcription start sites (TSSs) and a quantitative measure
of transcriptional activity in the studied samples. It provides the

scientific community With an unprecedented opportunity to analyze
the cis—regulatory regions acting upon the transcription of RNAs
from the identified TSSs.

TFs bind to the DNA in a sequence—specific manner at TF bind-
ing sites (TFBSs) to regulate gene transcription. Classically, TFBSs
are modeled using TF binding profiles, Which capture the prefered
DNA motifs bound by the TF (Stormo, 2013). Tools such as
OPOSSUM3 (Kwon et 61]., 2012) and HOMER (Heinz et 61]., 2010)
provide the ability to perform TF binding profile over-
representation analyses on sets of genomic regions to infer the likely

TFs acting upon them (for instance, gene promoter regions).
Specifically, the tools look for the enrichment of motifs in a set of
foreground sequences compared to a set of background ones.

By combining sample—specific CAGE—derived TSSs with TF bind—
ing profile enrichment analysis, it now becomes possible to predict
the TFs that are likely involved in the regulation of active genes asso—
ciated with TSSs. We hereby introduce the CAGEd—oPOSSUM tool
to perform TF binding profile enrichment analysis from genomic re-
gions derived from CAGE data.

This work is part of the FANTOM5 project. Data downloads,
genomic tools and co—published manuscripts are summarized here
http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/.

2 Usage and implementation

Through a web interface, CAGEd—oPOSSUM provides functional—
ities to determine the enrichment of TF binding profiles in a set of
user selected CAGE—derived genomic regions by comparing the fre-
quency of predicted TFBSs in the regions versus their frequency in
background regions.

2.1 CAGE—derived genomic regions selection

The user can either provide a set of CAGE peak regions as a BED—
formatted file, supply a set of FANTOM5 CAGE peak identifiers
(The FANTOM Consortium, 2014), or select FANTOM5 samples
from which CAGE peaks will be selected according to expression level
characteristics. To facilitate ease of selection in the latter case, an ex—
pandable tree of FANTOM5 samples, based on the corresponding
FANTOM5 sample ontology (The FANTOM Consortium, 2014)

derived from cell types (Ashburner et al., 2000), anatomical (Mungall
et al., 2012) and disease ontologies (Smith et al., 2007), is displayed.
The user then filters CAGE peaks based on expression characteristics,
proximity to known genes, or overlap with user—provided genomic re—
gions to be used for defining the foreground set of genomic regions
around TSSs (see Supplementary Text for details).

A similar procedure is used to select a background set of CAGE
peaks. As an additional option for the background, the user may
choose to use a random set of regions that is automatically generated
to match the %GC composition and length characteristics of the
foreground CAGE—derived genomic regions using the HOMER soft—
ware (Heinz et al., 2010).

2.2 TFBS prediction and enrichment analysis

Once the set of CAGE peaks is determined, CAGEd—oPOSSUM will
extract genomic regions around the corresponding TSSs (for instance
using 500 bp up— and downstream). Note that overlapping regions are
merged before the prediction of TFBSs using BEDTools (Quinlan and
Hall, 2010) to avoid counting the same TFBS multiple times. A set of
TF binding profiles is then selected from the JASPAR database
(Mathelier et al., 2016) or provided by the user to predict TFBSs in
the extracted genomic regions. By default, two statistical tests are em—
ployed to determine significance as previously described in
oPOSSUM3 (Kwon et al., 2012): (i) a Z—score that measures the
change in the relative number of TFBSs between the foreground and
the background sets and (ii) a Fisher score that assesses the number of
regions with a TFBS in the foreground set versus the background set.
CAGEd—oPOSSUM outputs a result table consisting of a ranked list of
TF binding profiles based on the enrichment scores (Fig. 1). As stated

above, the enrichment analysis is performed using oPOSSUM3 statis—
tical tests by default. CAGEd—oPOSSUM additionally allows the user
to perform motif enrichment analysis through the HOMER stand—
alone package (Heinz et al., 2010) as a complementary search (Fig.
1B). Finally, when JASPAR TF binding profiles were used to predict
TFBSs, CAGEd—oPOSSUM also performs the enrichment analysis
based on TF binding profile clusters derived from profile similarity
and defined by the matrix-clustering tool in RSAT (Medina-Rivera
et al., 2015; Castro—Mondragon et al., in preparation) (Fig. 1B and
Supplementary Text). Specifically, the TF binding profile clusters en-
richment analysis is performed following the TFBS Cluster Analysis
implemented in oPOSSUM3 (Kwon et al., 2012).

2.3 Precomputation of TFBSs for time efficiency

As the prediction of TFBSs can be time—consuming, a precomputa—
tion was performed from all genomic regions derived from
FANTOM5 CAGE peaks using TFBS profiles from the JASPAR
database (Mathelier et al., 2016). All FANTOM5 CAGE peak pos—
itions, samples, and expression level data along with the computed
genomic regions and predicted TFBSs (see Supplementary Text for
details) were stored in a MySQL database. This precomputation
allows for the fast analyses of FANTOM5 samples using JASPAR
TF binding profiles as the predicted TFBSs are fetched directly from
the database to compute the statistical enrichment scores. If the user
provides CAGE peak coordinates or TF binding profiles, a similar
process is executed in real time.

2.4 Examples of application

As case examples, we tested CAGEd—oPOSSUM on three input
FANTOM5 datasets from human primary cell and tissue samples:
liver, adult pooll (FANTOM5 identifier FF:10018—101C9); CD19—
positive B—cells, donor 1, 2 and 3 (FF:11544-120B5, FF:11624-
122B4, and FF:11705-123B4); and testis, adult, pool 1 and 2
(FF:10026—101D8 and FF:10096—102C6). Default analysis param—
eters were used to perform TF binding profile enrichment analyses
with both oPOSSUM3 and HOMER for each of these datasets (see
Supplementary Text for details).

The most enriched profile predicted by both oPOSSUM3 (using
the Fisher scores accounting for the number of genomic regions con-
taining at least one predicted TFBS) and HOMER were associated
with TFs known to be involved in the regulation of several biological
functions in the corresponding cells and tissues. Namely, HNF4A,
ETS factors and RELA, and RFX factors were predicted from the
liver, B—cells, and testis samples, respectively (see Supplementary Text,
Supplementary Figures, and Supplementary Data for details).

CAGEd—oPOSSUM has been applied to the 1,246 FANTOM5
samples (884 from human and 362 from mouse) and their 297 direct

ancestors (241 from human and 56 from mouse) in the ontology
trees using default parameters. The results can be found on the
CAGEd—oPOSSUM website (http://cagedop.cmmt.ubc.ca/CAGEd_
oPOSSUM/results/precomputed/) and links to the specific results are
also provided in the corresponding FANTOM5 SSTAR webpages
(Lizio et al., 2015).

3 Conclusion

Building upon the large—scale availability of CAGE experiments and
established tools (oPOSSUM3 and HOMER) for motif enrichment
analysis, we introduced a new computational tool, CAGEd—
oPOSSUM, to predict TFs regulating transcriptional events in spe—
cific cell types and tissues. CAGEd—oPOSSUM will empower the
community with the capacity to highlight specific TFs that may act
as key transcriptional regulators in their biological samples of inter-
est when CAGE experiments are available.

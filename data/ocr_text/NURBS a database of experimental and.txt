ABSTRACT

Summary: Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of transcription factors
playing important roles in various biological processes. An NR often
impacts numerous genes and different NRs share overlapped target
networks. To fulfil the need for a database incorporating binding sites
of different NRs at various conditions for easy comparison and visu-
alization to improve our understanding of NR binding mechanisms, we
have developed NURBS, a database for experimental and predicted
nuclear receptor binding sites of mouse (NURBS). NURBS currently
contains binding sites across the whole-mouse genome of 8 MRS
identified in 40 chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel
DNA sequencing experiments. All datasets are processed using a
widely used procedure and same statistical criteria to ensure the bind-
ing sites derived from different datasets are comparable. NURBS also
provides predicted binding sites using NR-HMM, a Hidden Markov
Model (HMM) model.

Availability: The GBrowse—based user interface of NURBS is freely
accessible at http://shark.abl.ku.edu/nurbs/. NR-HMM and all results
can be downloaded for free at the website.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nuclear receptors (NRs) are a class of ligand-regulated transcrip-
tion factors involved in many important biological processes,
such as development and metabolism, and implicated in various
human diseases, including diabetes, cardiovascular disease and
cancers (Overington et al., 2006). A single NR often impacts
numerous genes, and different NRs may compete for target
sites, resulting in overlapped target gene networks (Cotnoir-
White et al., 2011). Therefore, it is important to analyse and
compare the binding sites and target genes of various NRs and
determine the cross-talk between NRs. The recent development
of chromatin immunoprecipitation with massively parallel DNA
sequencing (ChIP-Seq) has greatly advanced the NR binding site
detection (Johnson et al., 2007). Consequently, data of experi-
mental NR binding sites have been accumulated rapidly.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Although there is limited effort to collect and archive
NR—related ChIP—Seq data (Kennedy et al., 2010; Tang et al.,
2011), to the best of our knowledge, no comprehensive database
of NR binding sites across whole genome has been developed for
easy comparing binding sites for different NRs.

It is well known that the binding sites of various NRs share a
similar sequence pattern that contains two half sites with a con-
sensus sequence of RGKTCA or its reverse complementary with
variable intervals from 0 to 8 base pairs (Sandelin and
Wasserman, 2005). There are three forms of such a pattern:
direct repeat, inverted repeat, everted repeat and their reverse
complement. Several methods have been used to predict NR
binding sites (Bulyk, 2003; Cartharius et al., 2005; Denver and
Williamson, 2009; Grau et al., 2006; Sandelin et al., 2004; Varga,
2010). One widely used method is NHR-Scan (Sandelin and
Wasserman, 2005), a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) using
107 experimentally determined NRs to predict two half sites sim-
ultaneously. However, NHR—Scan is no longer actively main-
tained, and its web-based interface does not allow predicting
binding sites at a large scale. To take advantage of recently dis-
covered binding sites and also to provide a standalone applica-
tion for genome-scale response element prediction to the
community, we have developed NR—HMM, a virtual basic
application implementing an HMM model based on the NHR-
Scan algorithm. The new model was trained on 151 experimen-
tally verif1ed binding sites.

We present NURBS, a database of binding sites across the
whole-mouse genome of 8 NRs identiﬁed in 40 ChIP-Seq
along with predicted binding sites of mouse genome using
NR—HMM.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The ChIP—Seq data used in NURBS are collected from NCBI
(Kodama et al., 2012). We regularly search the NCBI database
for each NR by its nomenclature committee name, abbreviation
and common name. At the time the manuscript was written,
NURBS had 40 ChIP—Seq datasets for 8 NRs. The information
regarding these datasets and corresponding NRs is summarized
in an online table available in the NURBS website.

To allow comparing multiple datasets, we perform genome
alignment and peak annotation for all collected datasets using

a well established procedure. In brief, all sequenced reads are
aligned to mm9 mouse reference genome (http://genome.ucsc.
edu/) (Dreszer et al., 2012) using bowtie (version 0.12.7)
(Langmead et al., 2009). All peaks are detected using the
model-based analysis for ChIP-Seq (MACS v.1.4.1) (Zhang
et al., 2008). The Poisson p-value cut-off for peak detection is
set to 10‘s. Overlapped peaks are split using Mali Salmon’s Peak
Splitter program (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/bertone/software.html).
The peak annotation is done using R package ChIPpeakAnno
(Zhu et al., 2010).

NR—HMM was built using NR binding sites collected in pre-
vious work and JASPAR CORE (http://jaspar.cgb.ki.se/cgi-bin/
jaspar_db.pl) (Sandelin and Wasserman, 2005). The sequences of
the collected binding sites were manually inspected, and only
those with two half sites were kept. The ﬁnal dataset contained
151 NR binding sites. The NR—HMM model is built using the
framework of NHR—Scan (Sandelin and Wasserman, 2005). The
parameters of HMM were estimated using Baum—Welch algo-
rithm. The transmission probability matrix was estimated based
on the frequency of each state in the training data. Laplace’s rule
pseudo count was applied to estimate the emission probability
matrix. The NR—HMM is then used to predict NR binding sites
in mouse genome (mm9), available as a GBrowse track in
NURBS.

The NURBS is implemented as a MySQL relational database
and uses the Generic Genome Browser (GBrowse) (Donlin,
2009) as its web browser based interface. GBrowse is user-
friendly and highly customizable. Links to the Mouse Genome
Informatics database (MGI, http://www.informatics.jax.org/) are
available in NURBS wherever possible. Because MGI also uses
GBrowse as its user interface, all MGI annotation trackers can
be easily downloaded and enabled in NURBS.

The main search page of NURBS is highly conﬁgurable by
users. Detailed examples are provided in an online help ﬁle. In
brief, users can click track buttons to select datasets for visual-
ization and comparison. The coverage option allows users to
choose whether to display the binding region intensities.
NURBS supports searches by name and region. A search
result page displays selected tracks of experimental data, pre-
dicted peaks by NR—HMM and annotations. A hypertext link
is available for a peak, leading to additional information, such as
sequence and genome location. Similarly, when an annotated
feature such as a gene is visible in the result page, a hyperlink
to the MGI database is provided so the users can access more
information such as genetic map position, mammalian homology
information, gene ontology and expression, as well as links to
other public databases such as Ensembl genome browser,
University of California at Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser
and NCBI.

3 CONCLUSION

We have developed NURBS, a web-based database for experi-
mental and predicted NR binding sites in mouse genome. It has a
customizable and user-friendly interface easy for navigating,
searching and comparing experimental and predicted NR bind-
ing sites for multiple NRs. All the data and the HMM model are
freely available for download. Currently, we are incorporating
transcriptome data in NURBS for more advanced studies and

expanding the database to human NRs for cross-species com-
parison. We intend to make NURBS a database open to the
community and encourage users to provide feedback and
submit new data and references. We have been actively populat-
ing the database and plan to maintain regular updates for the
years to come.

NURBS is distinct from other existing NR—related databases.
It is developed to provide researchers a convenient way to com-
pare experimental and predicted binding sites for various NRs,
along with genomic annotations. Other existing NR databases
are devoted to the sequences, structures and functions (Martinez
et al., 1998), mutations 07 an Durme et al., 2003; Vroling et al.,
2012) and phylogenies (Ruau et al., 2004) of NRs, not their
binding sites. Recently, Ochsner et al. (2012) set-up a database,
Transcriptomine, which is focused on the expression and func-
tion of NRs—related genes. The well developed Cistrome (Tang
et al., 2011) provides information about a number of NRs and
their co-factors and epigenomic information, and it is better
suited for investigating individual NR, as it does not provide
features for comparison between NRs. In addition, Cistrome
dedicates genomic visualization to remote UCSC genome
browser, whereas NURBS uses an integrated GBrowse, also
used by MGI.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Computational solvent fragment mapping is typically
performed on a single structure of a protein to identify and character-
ize binding sites. However, the simultaneous analysis of several
mutant structures or frames of a molecular dynamics simulation may
provide more realistic detail about the behavior of the sites. Here we
present a plug-in for Visual Molecular Dynamics that streamlines the
comparison of the binding configurations of several Fl'MAP-generated
structures.

1 INTRODUCTION

The identiﬁcation and characterization of ligand-binding sites in
proteins is of utmost importance for research into drug discovery
and biomolecular function. The experimental determination of
regions on the surface of the protein with high recurrence of
bound probes correlates well with the locations of drug-binding
sites (Hajduk et al., 2005). Interested readers are referred to the
following reviews: Sperandio et a]. (2008) and Vajda and
Guarnieri (2006). One popular method for experimental deter-
mination of such druggable ‘hot spots’ involves the process of
multiple solvent crystal structures (MSCS) (Allen et al., 1996;
Mattos and Ringe, 1996). During MSCS, the protein is solvated
within various probe compounds. The structure determined
using X-ray crystallography indicates probe-binding locations.

X-ray crystallization of multiple structures is expensive, and
computational fragment mapping can emulate this process to
identify binding sites (Vajda and Guarnieri, 2006). Various com-
putational methods for binding site identiﬁcation are compared
in Morrow and Zhang, 2012. The FTMAP algorithm (Brenke
et al., 2009) seeks to mimic the MSCS method and has been
shown to predict the analogous binding of probe molecules
with a high degree of success. To gain a comprehensive under-
standing about a protein’s ligand-binding characteristics, struc-
tural knowledge alone is often insufﬁcient. A single structure
ignores protein dynamics, which may alter probe-binding loca-
tion, number and capacity (Landon et al., 2008).

Here we present FTProd, a program capable of clustering hot
spots spanning multiple structures, and which allows for the ease

of identiﬁcation and characterization of those hot spots with
a graphical user interface. FTProd is a plug-in for Visual
Molecular Dynamics (VMD; Humphrey et al., 1996), a molecu-
lar visualization program free for academic use.

2 METHODS

FTProd analyzes structures that have been processed with FTMAP,
which contain a series of small molecular probes indicating the location
of potentially druggable consensus sites (CSs). When run, FTProd uses
one of several available cross-structural clustering methods, which are
described in detail in the Supplementary Material.

Depending on which method the user speciﬁes, the algorithm selects
CSs that are the most spatially similar, grouping them together into a
cluster. Several hierarchical clustering methods are implemented in
FTProd, as well as the “greedy clustering” method used in FTMAP.
FTProd can cluster sites within the same structure, but also provides
the option to cluster CSs that only exist within separate structures.

FTProd integrates with and uses VMD with the goal of providing a
smooth easy-to-use graphical user interface, through which researchers
can visualize, identify and characterize cross-structural hot spots in pro-
teins. On running FTProd on loaded and selected structures, the plug-in
creates a Table widget (Fig. lc), which tabulates every structure and CS
that exists within its respective structure(s). On selecting one or multiple
CSs, FTProd draws the relevant site and associated probe fragments in
VMD’s viewer. Additional FTProd features are detailed in the
Supplementary Material.

To demonstrate the utility of FTProd, we performed cross-structural
analysis over several strains of inﬂuenza neuraminidase (NA). We chose
NA for its well-understood binding sites and high ﬂexibility (Landon
et al., 2008; Votapka et al., 2012). Here, average-link agglomerative clus-
tering was used with an inter-CS cutoff of 8.0 A.

3 RESULTS

We demonstrate FTProd’s ability to characterize and display
cross-structural ligand-binding sites by examining four X-ray
crystal apo structures of NA obtained from various inﬂuenza
strains downloaded from the PDB. The PDB IDs of the strains
we used were lMWE (Varghese et al., 1997), 2HUO (Russell
et al., 2006), 2HU4 (Russell et al., 2006) and 3NSS (Li et al.,
2010). The primary role of NA in inﬂuenza pathogenesis is the
cleavage of sialic acid after binding to the active site. Another
binding site, the secondary sialic acid site, is also partially respon-
sible for substrate afﬁnity. Depending on the strain, NA may
possess a so-called 150 pocket, a highly variable site (Amaro
et al., 2011), which presents a target for drug design efforts.
FTProd successfully identiﬁes important binding sites across
the structures, ranking them by decreasing predicted binding
ability. The sialic acid-binding site is correctly identiﬁed as the
predominant binding location. PDB structure 2HUO docks more

than twice as many probes as the 150 sites in any other structure
(Fig. la). This is consistent with the structural understanding of
2HUO, which exhibits an open ‘150 pocket’ (Russell et al., 2006).

One site identiﬁed for 3NSS also corresponds to a location
where an acetate ion has been resolved in the 3NSS crystal struc-
ture (Supplementary Fig. S2). Additional examples are provided
in the Supplementary Material.

4 DISCUSSION

The determination of potentially druggable sites on the surface of
a protein represents an area of intense interest to drug discovery
and other applications. FTProd provides the capability to com-
pare the characteristics of pockets between crystal structures of
structurally similar proteins. The burden is placed on the user to
determine whether two structures ought to be compared.
RMSD-based clustering of molecular dynamics (MD) trajec-
tories could be one of many methods that may be used to identify
input for FTProd, along with binding site similarity, analogous
structures, similar substrates or any other structural similarity
metric. FTProd’s utility is completely extensible toward the ana-
lysis of the frames of a simulation trajectory, as may be generated
by an MD simulation. To our knowledge, FTProd is the only
existing tool that integrates protein structural dynamics data for
the purpose of binding site characterization.

The inclusion of cross-structural or dynamic information in
the analysis of these ‘hot spots’ is likely to increase the predictive
accuracy and scope of these computational methods by provid-
ing a more realistic picture of ligand binding. Given the high
success of the FTMAP algorithm, we expect that FTProd will
greatly aid researchers in the analysis of protein pockets by
streamlining interstructural CS comparison.

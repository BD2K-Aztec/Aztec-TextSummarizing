Abstract

Motivation: The accumulation of high—throughput data in public repositories creates a pressing
need for integrative analysis of multiple datasets from independent experiments. However, study
heterogeneity, study bias, outliers and the lack of power of available methods present real chal—
lenge in integrating genomic data. One practical drawback of many P—value—based meta—analysis
methods, including Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, minP and maxP, is that they are sensitive to outliers.
Another drawback is that, because they perform just one statistical test for each individual experi—
ment, they may not fully exploit the potentially large number of samples within each study.
Results: We propose a novel bi—level meta—analysis approach that employs the additive method
and the Central Limit Theorem within each individual experiment and also across multiple experi—
ments. We prove that the bi—level framework is robust against bias, less sensitive to outliers than
other methods, and more sensitive to small changes in signal. For comparative analysis, we dem—
onstrate that the intra—experiment analysis has more power than the equivalent statistical test per—
formed on a single large experiment. For pathway analysis, we compare the proposed framework
versus classical meta—analysis approaches (Fisher’s, Stouffer’s and the additive method) as well as
against a dedicated pathway meta—analysis package (MetaPath), using 1252 samples from 21 data—
sets related to three human diseases, acute myeloid leukemia (9 datasets), type II diabetes (5 data—
sets) and Alzheimer’s disease (7 datasets). Our framework outperforms its competitors to correctly
identify pathways relevant to the phenotypes. The framework is sufficiently general to be applied
to any type of statistical meta—analysis.

1 Introduction

With rapid advances in high—throughput technologies, the gener—
ation of various kinds of high—throughput genomic data is prevalent
in most biomedical research. Advanced techniques in sequencing
(e.g. RNA—Seq, miRNA—Seq, DNA—Seq) and microarray assays (e.g.
gene expression, methylation) have transformed biological research
by enabling comprehensive monitoring of biological systems. Vast

amounts of data of all types have accumulated in many public repo—
sitories, such as Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) (Barrett et 61].,
2013), Array Express (Rustici et 61]., 2013) and The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA) (http://cancergenome.nih.gov/). Gene expression
data, as measured by microarray and high—throughput sequencing,
are particularly abundant in public repositories, such that many dis—
eases are represented by half a dozen studies or more.

It would be tremendously beneficial if all datasets associated
with a given condition could be analyzed together because of the in—
crease in power expected to be associated with the much larger num-
ber of measurements in the combined dataset. However, batch
effects, patient heterogeneity and disease complexity all complicate
the integration of data from different sources. Indeed, for the same
disease, different studies produce different sets of differentially ex-
pressed (DE) genes (Ein—Dor et al., 2005, 2006; Tan et al., 2003),
and we will show that this problem is not resolved at the systems
level, as pathway analysis results are often inconsistent as well.

Meta—analysis techniques, which are statistical methods for the
quantitative analysis of independent but related studies (Normand,
1999), have already proven to be very useful for combining gene ex-
pression studies (Ramasamy et al., 2008; Tseng et al., 2012), and
will be critical to decipher the biological knowledge contained in
vast amounts of often conﬂicting studies, independent of the data
type. In this manuscript, we describe a novel meta—analysis,
and apply it to gene expression data in the context of pathway
analysis.

Meta—analysis of gene expression data has primarily been used
for DE gene detection (Tseng et al., 2012). Early meta—analyses sim—
ply performed the intersection or union of DE gene lists obtained
from individual studies (Borovecki et al., 2005 ; Manoli et al., 2006),
resulting in a single list which is either too conservative or too inclu—
sive, respectively. Rhodes et al. (2002) were among the earliest to
apply sophisticated meta—analysis methods for DE gene detection. In
their work, P-values from multiple prostate cancer datasets were
combined using Fisher’s method (Fisher, 1925). Since then, other
P—value—based meta—analysis methods have been applied, such as
Stouffer’s method (Stouffer et al., 1949), minP (Tippett, 1931),
maxP (Wilkinson, 1951), weighted Fisher’s method (Li and Tseng,
2011), and latent variable approaches (Choi et al., 2007). A recent
literature review (Tseng et al., 2012) revealed that P—value—based
meta—analysis for gene detection accounts for approximately twice
as many studies as any other type of meta—analysis, and is favored
for its simplicity and extensibility. Therefore, we will focus on this
type of P—value—based meta—analysis, investigate its limitations, and
address them with our new approach.

Pathway analysis belongs to a family of statistical hypothesis
testing (Goeman and Buhlmann, 2007) methods that have been de—
veloped to leverage molecular pathway knowledge bases such as the
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000; Ogata et al., 1999) or Reactome (Croft et al., 2014).
These knowledge bases contain graphs that describe how genes
interact together to accomplish specific biological processes. Over—
Representation Analysis (ORA) (Draghici et al., 2003), Gene Set
Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et al., 2005), Gene Set
Analysis (GSA) (Efron and Tibshirani, 2007) and Impact Analysis
(Draghici et al., 2007), are examples of approaches designed to
identify the pathways that are relevant in a given condition. All
of them take gene expression changes and a list of pathways as
input, and produce a ranked list of pathways along with their
P-values.

Recently, meta—analysis has also been used to combine multiple
experiments at the pathway level (Kaever et al., 2014; Shen and
Tseng, 2010). The work in (Kaever et al., 2014) uses classical meth—
ods, such as Fisher’s method and Stouffer’s method, to combine
P—values of pathways from independent studies. The work in (Shen
and Tseng, 2010), named MetaPath, is a dedicated approach that
performs meta—analysis at both the gene and pathway level separ—
ately, and then combines the results to give the final P—value and
ranking of pathways. For gene level analysis, MetaPath calculates a

t—statistic for each gene in each study, then combines them using the
maxP method (Wilkinson, 1951). A pathway enrichment score is
calculated using these genes, for each pathway, using a
Kolmogorov—Smirnov test, and assessed for significance with a sam—
ple—wise permutation test. At the pathway level, MetaPath calculates
pathway enrichment for each individual study, then combines the
P—values, again using the maxP method (Wilkinson, 1951). Finally,
P—values from the gene and pathway level are integrated using minP
(Tippett, 1931) to give the final P—value and ranking of pathways.

One practical drawback of many P—value—based meta—analysis
methods, including Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, minP and maxP, is that they
are sensitive to outliers. For example, Fisher’s method employs the
log product of individual P—values and thus, a single P—value of zero
in one individual case will result in a combined P—value of zero re—
gardless of the other P—values. This can be a serious problem for
pathway analysis methods that employ a finite number of iterations
to construct an empirical distribution of a statistic which is then
used to calculate an empirical P—value. If the observed value of the
statistic is more extreme than any of the values obtained by the iter—
ations, such methods may report a P—value of zero, which will, in
turn, dramatically inﬂuence the meta P—value.

Another drawback of most P—value—based meta—analysis
approaches is that, because they perform just one statistical test for
each individual experiment, they may not fully exploit the poten—
tially large number of samples within each study. A statistical test
which is not powerful enough to reject the null hypothesis in one in-
dividual experiment can only derive power by amassing a large num—
ber of experiments. Low power in the case of a single experiment
can be due in part to a mathematical design which favors a moderate
number of samples, but may fail to fully exploit large sample sizes.
For example, the basic t—test is designed to do well even with a small
number of samples in each group. While the power of the t—test in—
creases as the number of samples increases, a set of 20 experiments
with 5 samples each has more power than a single experiment com-
prised of the same 100 samples (see Fig. S4 in Supplementary
Materials).

Here we propose a P—value—based meta—analysis framework
which addresses the mentioned shortcomings and thus provides
more reliable results. As we will demonstrate, the proposed method
is not sensitive to outliers. To gain power from the large number of
samples within each experiment, the proposed meta—analysis inte—
grates multiple independent studies on two levels: an intm-experi-
ment analysis, and an inter-experiment analysis. First, for
each individual experiment, the intra—experiment analysis splits
the dataset into smaller datasets, performs a statistical test on each
of the newly created small datasets, then combines the P—values.
Next, the inter—experiment analysis combines those processed
P—values, from each of the individual experiments. We demonstrate
the power of our bi—level meta—analysis in the context of pathway
analysis.

We illustrate our approach using one of the most popular statis—
tical methods for pathway analysis, Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA), applying it to KEGG pathways, and 21 public gene expres—
sion datasets, conducted in independent laboratories, from three
conditions: acute myeloid leukemia (9 datasets), type II diabetes
(5 datasets) and Alzheimer’s disease (7 datasets). We compare the re—
sult of the proposed framework with three classical meta—analysis
methods (Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, and the additive method), plus the
standalone meta—analysis method—MetaPath. For all three condi—
tions, our framework outperforms other approaches and correctly
identifies the pathways designed to describe the biological processes
responsible for these diseases.

2 Methods

2.1 P—value—based meta—analysis

We first describe Fisher’s method and the additive method for com—
bining P—values, then discuss some of their limitations.
Subsequently, we introduce our technique, and discuss how it
addresses these limitations.

Fisher’s method is one of the most widely used methods for com—
bining multiple independent studies based on their P—values. Under
the null hypothesis, the log product of individual P—values follows a
12 distribution with 2m degrees of freedom (Fisher, 1925). This dis-
tribution is used to calculate the probability of observing the log
product of individual P—values. One practical drawback of this ap—
proach is that if one of the individual P—values approaches zero, the
combined P—value approaches zero as well, regardless of other indi—
vidual P—values. Another drawback is that this method is very sensi—
tive to bias under the null (i.e. the P—values under the null do not
follow a uniform distribution). This results in a high false positive
rate (see Fig. 88 in Supplementary Materials).

The additive method (Edgington, 1972; Hall, 1927; Irwin, 1927)
uses the sum of the P—values as the test statistic, instead of the log
product. Let us denote the P—values resulting from the m independ-
ent significance tests as P1, P2, . . . , Pm. These P—values are independ—
ent and uniformly distributed between zero and one under the null
(i.e. all P—values between zero and one are equally probable
when the null hypothesis is true). Denote the sum of these P—values,
X :  P,- (X E [0, m]), as the new random variable. X is known
to follow the Irwin-Hall distribution (Hall, 1927; Irwin, 1927) with
the following probability density function (pdf):

1 lxl i m .m—

!
i=0

Unlike Fisher’s method, the additive method is not sensitive to small
individual P—values. However, we note that the additive method
faces a different practical problem. For large values of m, Eq. (1) in-
volves some intensive computation due to a sum of combinatorial
and division by a factorial, the result of which can lead to an ‘arith—
metic underflow’. In other words, the result can be a number smaller
than what a computer can actually store in memory. Figure 1

displays the Irwin—Hall probability density function (pdf) (left panel)
and the area under the pdf curve (AUC) (right panel) for different m
values. For each value of m, the area under the curve, F(X : m),
should be 1 and therefore the log absolute value of F(X : m) should
be 0. However, the calculation is not accurate for large values of m
and the area under the curve increases very rapidly (right panel).
The calculation of the additive method is not reliable when m > 30.

Here we describe an enhancement to the additive method that
makes it more reliable for larger values of m. First, we change the
random variable from the sum of the P—values to the average of the
P—values. Second, when m is large, we replace the additive method
with the Central Limit Theorem (CLT). The reason for the modifica—
tion is that the additive method is accurate for small values of m,
while the Central Limit Theorem is more accurate for large values of
m. We select m = 20 as a conservative cut—off. In other words, we
will use the additive method when m <20, and the Central Limit
Theorem when 171220.

To show the validity of using the Central Limit Theorem for

large m, we define a new random variable Y =  (Y E [0, 1]),
X

which is the average of P—values. Since Y = a, we can derive the
probability density function (pdf) of Y using a linear transformation

of X as follows:

lm‘yl m

g(y)—(m_1),;( 1)< )(m y 2) <2)
The corresponding cumulative distribution function (cdf) can be
calculated as:

GOP—Z (1)i<n.1>(m-yi)m (3)

The variable Y is the mean of m independent and identically dis—
tributed (i.i.d.) random variables (the P—values from each individual
experiment), that follow a uniform distribution with a mean of %
and a variance of  From the Central Limit Theorem (Kallenberg,
2002), the average of such m i.i.d. variables follows a normal distri-
bution with mean ,u 2% and variance 0'2 : ﬂ, i.e. Y N N
for sufficiently large values of m.

therefore the Iog1o(AUC) should be 0. However, due to the complexity of the Irwin-Hall formula and arithmetic underflow, the calculation is not accurate for large
values of m and the AUC increases very rapidly. The figure shows that the calculation is completely unreliable when m > 30

In the rest of the manuscript, we refer to our proposed combin—
ation of the Irwin—Hall distribution and the Central Limit Theorem
as ‘add—CLT’, for ‘additive—Central Limit Theorem’, in order to dis-
tinguish it from the classical additive method. As noted above, the
transition from the additive method to the Central Limit Theorem
takes place at the 141220 threshold.

The pdf of Y for different m values and the corresponding AUCs
are displayed in Figure 81 in Supplementary Materials. The data
show that the AUC is 1 as it should be, for all values of m. We can
see that add—CLT overcomes the computational problem of the clas—
sical additive method using the Irwin—Hall distribution.

2.2 Bi—level meta—analysis framework

In this section we describe the bi—level meta—analysis framework in
the context of pathway analysis. The input of the framework is as
follows. First, we have m studies (datasets) of the same disease. Each
dataset consists of a group of healthy samples and a group of disease
samples. Second, we have a list of k pathways from an existing path-
way database. Third, we have a pathway analysis method that can
be used to identify the significantly impacted pathways in a given
dataset. This pathway analysis method is used for each dataset, thus
calculating a P—value for each of the k pathways in each of the m
datasets.

Figure 2 displays the overall procedure of our framework. The
framework is divided into two stages: intra—experiment analysis and
inter-experiment analysis. The intra-experiment analysis works with
one dataset at a time. Given a dataset DS, (1' E [1..m]), we divide the
disease samples into 11,- smaller groups. Each data subset consists of a
small group of disease samples and all the control samples in the
dataset. We impose that each small group include at least 5 disease
samples, therefore, 11,- approximately equals the number of disease
samples divided by 5. Using the chosen pathway analysis method,
we calculate the P—values for the k pathways for each of the 11,- small
datasets. The result is 11,- lists of P—values, each with k P—values for
the k pathways. Therefore, each pathway will have n,- P—values,
one from each of the 11,- lists. The n,- P—values are then combined into
a single P—value for each pathway using the add—CLT described
above.

After performing intra-level—analysis on all m studies (datasets),
we have m lists of P—values—one per study, and each pathway has m
independent P—values. Using add—CLT, the inter—experiment analysis
combines the m P—values of each pathway into one meta P—value
that represents the significance of the pathway. The output of the
whole framework is a list of k pathways ranked according to the
meta P—values.

While our bi—level framework is described in the context of path—
way analysis, it can be modified and applied in any context. For ex-
ample, the pathway analysis method can be substituted with another
statistical test, or applied in totally different field. In addition, our
add—CLT method maybe replaced by another meta—analysis method.
However, we favor add—CLT for several reasons. First, it is robust
against small P—values and against bias under the null. Second, it is
more powerful than Fisher’s method in detecting changes in signal
(see Figs 88, S9 in Supplementary Materials).

3 Experimental studies

In order to provide a deeper understanding of why intra-experiment
analysis improves results on a mathematical level, we applied it to a
two—sample t—test and compared the results to a standard t—test. We
show that splitting datasets and combining P—values using add—CLT

results in a gain of power. We also investigated the false positive rate
of the bi—level meta—analysis and the robustness with respect to various
split sizes. Furthermore, we compared add—CLT against the popular
Fisher’s method. The results show that add—CLT is more reliable than
Fisher’s method in terms of both false positive rate (FPR) and true
positive rate (TPR) (see Figs 84—89 in Supplementary Materials).

For the experiments based on real expression data, we compare
5 different meta—analysis approaches in the context of pathway ana—
lysis: our bi—level approach with add—CLT, three classical meta—ana—
lysis methods (Fisher’s, Stouffer’s and the additive method), and one
standalone, dedicated, pathway meta—analysis method—MetaPath.
We use the KEGG pathway database (version 65, 150 human path—
ways). For the 4 methods that need a pathway analysis algorithm,
we select GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005 ), which is currently one
of the most popular methods.

We chose 21 datasets related to three human diseases: type II dia—
betes (5 datasets), acute myeloid leukemia (AML) (9 datasets) and
Alzheimer’s disease (7 datasets). These disease datasets were chosen
for several reasons—not only are they well suited for meta—analysis,
but we have a good way to evaluate the results. For each disease, there
is a dedicated pathway in KEGG that was created in order to describe

lysis combines the n,- P-values into one P-value for each pathway using add-
CLT. After this process is done for all m studies (datasets), each pathway has
m independent P—values — one per study. The inter-experiment analysis then
combines the m P-values for each pathway into one meta P—value using the
add-CLT method. This meta P-value for each pathway represents the overall
significance of the pathway. The output of the framework is a list of k path-
ways ranked according to the meta P-values

the known mechanisms involved in these specific diseases. Thus, the
five analysis methods can be assessed by their ability to identify these
‘target pathways’ in their respective conditions.

3.1 Pathway analysis using type II diabetes data

The diabetes datasets we use in our data analysis were obtained
from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs: GSE25462 (skel—
etal muscle, 10 cases and 15 controls), GSE19420 (skeletal muscle,
10 cases and 12 controls), GSE18732 (skeletal muscle, 45 cases and
47 controls), GSE23343 (liver biopsy, 10 cases and 7 controls) and
GSE22309 (skeletal muscle, 30 cases and 40 controls). Details of all
datasets are provided in Supplementary Materials.

We use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) to analyze the 5
diabetes datasets individually, before performing the meta—analysis.
For each dataset, GSEA produces a list of 150 KEGG pathways
ranked by P—values. The rankings and FDR—corrected P—values of
the target pathway Type II diabetes are displayed in Figure S2 in
Supplementary Materials. The target pathway gets an FDR—cor—
rected P—value higher than 0.5 in every single one of the diabetes
datasets. The target pathway is ranked between 4th (in GSE23343)
and 133th (in GSE19420). This is a clear case in which the correct
pathway is missed in every single one of the 5 individual datasets
available; such a situation calls for meta—analysis.

Proceeding to meta—analysis of these 5 datasets, the most
straightforward approach is to combine the 5 P—values produced by
GSEA for each pathway, using classical P—value—based meta—analysis
methods. Here we use three classical approaches to combine the in—
dependent P—values: Fisher’s (Fisher, 1925), Stouffer’s (Stouffer et
al., 1949) and the additive method (Edgington, 1972; Hall, 1927;
Irwin, 1927). Fisher’s and Stouffer’s method have been used in
(Kaever et al., 2014) to combine P—values of pathways in independ—
ent experiments. Stouffer’s method is similar to Fisher’s method,
with the difference that, as the random variable, it uses the sum of
P—values transformed into standard normal variables instead of the

Table 1. Results of combining GSEA P—values using 4 meta-analysis

log product. Alongside these three classical meta—analysis tech—
niques, we juxtapose our bi—level meta—analysis. The result of each is
a list of all 150 pathways ranked according to the combined P—val—
ues, which we adjust for multiple comparisons using FDR.

Table 1 lists the top 5 ranked pathways and FDR—corrected P—
values obtained by combining the 5 diabetes datasets using the 4
meta—analysis approaches. The pathway highlighted green is the tar—
get pathway Type II diabetes mellitus, which was created in order to
describe the phenomena involved in this disease. The horizontal line
marks the cutoff of 0.05 of the FDR—corrected P—values. All three
classical meta—analysis approaches, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, and the addi—
tive method, fail to identify the target pathway as significant
(P > 0.4) with rankings 7, 10 and 12, respectively. The Oocyte mei-
osis pathway has a combined P—value equal to zero for Fisher’s and
Stouffer’s methods because the P—value was zero for one of the data—
sets (GSE22309). As discussed in the Methods section, these
approaches are sensitive to such occurrences. The bi—level meta—ana—
lysis approach identifies the target pathway Type II diabetes mellitus
as the most significant pathway (P = 0.0151). Also, this is the only
significant pathway at the 5% significance threshold.

As a fifth method, we employ MetaPath (Shen and Tseng, 2010),
to combine the 5 studies. MetaPath (Shen and Tseng, 2010) is a
dedicated pathway meta—analysis which is open source and does not
require an external pathway analysis method. In our work, we use
the R package provided in (Wang et al., 2012). MetaPath performs
meta—analysis at both gene and pathway levels with a GSEA—like ap-
proach, and then combines the results to give the final P—value and
ranking of pathways. Table 2 lists the top 5 pathways using
MetaPath. The target pathway Type II diabetes mellitus is ranked
80th out of 150 with an FDR—corrected P—value of 1.

The top 5 pathways and their FDR-corrected P-Values obtained by combining the P-Values of GSEA using 4 meta-analysis approaches: Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, the

additive method and bi-level meta-analysis. In the ﬁrst three approaches, the 5 P-Values for a pathway (one of each of the 5 datasets) were combined into a single

p-Value using Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, or the additive method. This is done for all of the 150 signaling pathways in KEGG. The P-Values are then adjusted for multiple

comparisons using FDR. The pathways are sorted by the combined P-Values, from low to high. The horizontal lines show the 5% signiﬁcance threshold. The

target pathway Type II diabetes mellitus is highlighted in green. The target pathway Type II diabetes mellitus is the only signiﬁcant pathway using the bi-level

meta-analysis. The three classical approaches, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s and the additive method, fail to identify the target pathway as signiﬁcant and rank it in positions

7th, 10th and 12th, respectively.

cases and 4 controls), GSE12662 (fractionated bone marrow:

cases and 24 controls), GSE57194 (primary CD34—l—cells, 6 cases
and 6 controls), GSE33223 (peripheral blood mononuclear cells, 20
cases and 10 controls), GSE42140 (peripheral blood mononuclear
cells, 26 cases and 5 controls), GSE8023 (CD34—l—cells from cord
blood, 9 cases and 3 controls) and GSE15061 (bone marrow, 201
cases and 68 controls).

We use Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (GSEA) (Subramanian et
al., 2005) to analyze the 9 AML datasets individually. The rankings
and FDR—corrected P—values of the target pathway Acute myeloid
leukemia for the 9 datasets are displayed in Figure S3 in the
Supplementary Materials. The AML pathway is assigned an FDR-
corrected P—value ranging from 0.23 (GSE57194) to 1 (GSE33223)
and a ranking between 12 (GSE42140) and 114 (GSE14924) across
the 9 datasets analyzed. In essence, the AML pathway, which was
created precisely to describe the most important biological mechan-
isms involved in AML, is neither found to be significant, nor ranked
anywhere close to the top in any of the individual datasets.

We again use the 4 meta—analysis approaches to combine GSEA
results: Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, the additive method, and the bi—level
meta—analysis. The output for each of these 4 approaches is a list of
150 pathways ranked according to the combined P—values. Table 3

lists the top 5 ranked pathways and FDR—corrected global P—values
yielded by the 4 meta—analysis approaches. The green highlight
shows the target pathway Acute myeloid leukemia. The horizontal
line is the selected significance cutoff of 0.05.

None of the three classical meta—analysis approaches identify the
target pathway Acute myeloid leukemia as significant. Fisher’s yields
a global P—value of 0.264, Stouffer’s yield a global P—value of 0.099
and the additive method yields a P—value of 0.112. Fisher’s method
ranked the target pathway as 4th out of 150. The bi—level meta—ana—
lysis with add—CLT identifies the target pathway as significant with
a P—value of 0.0005, and also ranks it 1st.

Again, we also provide the results of MetaPath (Shen and Tseng,
2010) when analyzing the 9 studies together. Table 4 lists the top 5
pathways using MetaPath for the 9 acute myeloid leukemia datasets.
The target pathway Acute myeloid leukemia is highlighted green.
This pathway is not significant (P = 0.4), and is ranked 3rd.

3.3 Pathway analysis using Alzheimer’s data

As a final case, we selected Alzheimer’s disease because we want to
give an example of a situation with more than one expected path—
way. Alzbeimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s dis-
ease are three neurological disorders that share many signaling
mechanisms and affect the same tissue (brain). The common elem—

The 5 top ranked pathways and FDR-corrected P-Values obtained by combining the P-Values of GSEA using 4 meta-analysis approaches: Fisher’s, Stouffer’s,

the additive method and bi-level meta-analysis. In the ﬁrst three approaches, the 7 P-Values for a pathway (one of each of the 7 datasets) were combined into a sin-

gle P-Value using Fisher’s, Stouffer’s and the additive method. This is done for all of the 150 signaling pathways in KEGG. The P-Values are then adjusted for mul-

tiple comparisons using FDR. The pathways are sorted by the combined P-Values, from low to high. The horizontal lines show the 5% signiﬁcance threshold. The

target pathway Alzheimer’s disease and two neurological disease pathways, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, are highlighted in green. Only the bi-

level meta-analysis identiﬁes all three neurological disease pathways, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Huntington’s disease, as signiﬁcant.

ents include abnormal protein folding, endoplasmic reticulum stress,
and ubiquitin mediated breakdown of proteins, leading to pro—
grammed cell death (Swerdlow, 2011; Maruszak and Zekanowski,
2011; Zhu et al., 2013; Querfurth and Laferla, 2010). Furthermore,
previous studies have shown the presence of a strong cross—talk that
makes these three neurological disease pathways appear as signifi—
cant simultaneously, due to their dominant mitochondrial module
(Donato et al., 2013). Therefore, we expect a good analysis method
to find all three of these pathways as significant in this meta—analysis
of Alzheimer’s data.

The Alzheimer’s datasets we use in our data analysis were ob—
tained from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) with IDs: GSE1297
(hippocampus, 22 cases and 9 controls), GSE28146 (hippocampus,
22 cases and 8 controls) and GSE5281 (a mixture of entorhinal cor-
tex, hippocampus, medial temporal gyrus, posterior cingulate, su—
perior frontal gyrus and primary visual cortex, 87 cases and 74
controls), GSE1675 9 (parietal lobe cortex, 4 cases and 4 controls),
GSE48350 (a mixture of post central gyrus, superior frontal gyrus,
hippocampus and entorhinal cortex, 80 cases and 173 controls),
GSE39420 (brain tissues, 14 cases and 7 controls) and GSE4757
(entorhinal cortex, 10 cases and 10 controls).

Again, we use the 5 meta—analysis approaches, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s,
the additive method, the bi—level meta—analysis and MetaPath, to com—
bine the 7 Alzheimer’s studies. Table 5 lists the top 5 ranked pathways
and FDR—corrected P—values obtained by combining the 7 Alzheimer’s
datasets using the 4 existing meta—analysis approaches. Table 6 lists
the top 5 ranked pathways using MetaPath. The horizontal line marks
the 5% cutoff for the FDR—corrected P—values.

All 4 meta-analysis approaches, Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, the additive
method and MetaPath, fail to identify the primary target pathway
Alzheimer’s disease as significant, and rank it on positions 5, 11, 28
and 40, respectively. They also fail to identify Parkinson’s disease as
significant. Among 4 existing meta—analysis approaches, only
Fisher’s method identifies Huntington’s disease as significant.

In contrast, the bi—level meta—analysis approach identifies the tar—
get pathway Alzbeimer’s disease as significant (P=0.0149) with
ranking 2. In addition, the pathways Huntington’s disease and

None of the three neurological disease pathways, Huntington’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease and Parkinson’s disease, appears as signiﬁcant. They are
ranked on positions 4th, 40th, 16th, respectively.

Parkinson’s disease also appear as significant in the results of the bi-
level meta—analysis. Furthermore, the proposed approach does not
produce any false positives.

For all three disease conditions, diabetes, AML and Alzheimer’s
disease, the classical meta—analysis approaches and MetaPath were
unable to identify the target pathway as significant. Only the pro—
posed bi—level meta—analysis identifies the target pathway as signifi-
cant. This is likely due to two reasons. First, the combination of the
additive method and the Central Limit Theorem is reliable in terms
of both false positive rate and true positive rate. Second, the intra—
experiment analysis performed within each of the individual studies
increases the power of the pathway analysis.

4 Conclusion

In this article, we present a novel meta—analysis approach that com—
bines multiple studies to gain more statistical power. The new
framework exploits not only the vast number of studies performed
in independent laboratories, but also makes better use of the

available number of samples within individual studies. In addition,
the use of the additive method and the Central Limit Theorem
makes the framework robust to outliers and keeps the false positive
rate under the desired threshold.

To evaluate the proposed framework for pathway analysis appli-
cations, we analyze 5 diabetes datasets, 9 acute myeloid leukemia
datasets and 7 Alzheimer’s datasets using 5 different approaches:
Fisher’s, Stouffer’s, the additive method, MetaPath and the bi—level
meta—analysis. For each of these three diseases, there is a KEGG
pathway, referred to as the target pathway, that describes the phe—
nomena associated with these conditions. All 4 existing meta—ana-
lysis methods fail to identify the target pathways as significant after
combining all available datasets for each condition. In contrast, the
proposed bi—level meta—analysis identifies the target pathways as sig—
nificant in all three conditions. These results confirm the increased
power of the bi—level meta—analysis with respect to the other meta—
analysis approaches.

Although the bi—level meta—analysis framework is illustrated in
the context of pathway analysis, it is in fact a general meta—analysis
method that can easily replace existing meta—analysis procedures in
a wide range of research areas, such as biomarker/oncogene detec—
tion, genome—wide association studies (GWAS), enrichment analysis
(Gene Ontology, gene set analysis), or even clinical trials to assess
the effect of a therapy in complex diseases.

Bioimage informatics arose from efforts to automate pathology
and cytology tasks (Eaves, 1967). With few exceptions, much of
the software developed during these early days, whether in aca-
demic or commercial institutions, was proprietary. The primary
paradigm was production of hand-tuned engineered systems that
could reproduce human performance, and visualization was
emphasized for interpreting results or providing assistance to clin-
icians (Bartels and Wied, 1977; Kaman, et al., 1984; van Driel-
Kulker and Ploem, 1982). The computational resources available
at the time were frequently limiting. Essentially, no successful
commercial systems came from these efforts for many years,
until the US F cod and Drug Administration’s approval of auto-
mated Pap smear analysis in the mid 1990s (Patten et al., 1996).

Beginning around this time, a new era began with automation of
tasks associated with more basic measurement of cellular and sub-
cellular phenomena, such as detection of drug effects (Giuliano
et al., 1997) and recognition of subcellular patterns (Boland et al.,
1998). The ﬁeld gained signiﬁcant exposure, and a new name, with
the founding of two National Science F oundation—sponsored
Centers for Bioimage Informatics at the University of
California, Santa Barbara and Carnegie Mellon University in
2003. This led to the ﬁrst Bioimage Informatics conference held
in Santa Barbara in 2006. The primary paradigm in this era
became supervised and semisupervised machine learning, and
automated systems were reported that were able to outperform
humans at recognizing cell positions in tissues (Nattkemper et al.,
2003) and recognizing subcellular patterns (Murphy et al., 2003).
Cutting-edge systems during this period increasingly avoided visu-
alization, hand-tuning or user intervention (with the exception of
marking things like cell or nuclear boundaries for training pur-
poses), with a primary goal to produce a simple actionable answer.
Examples include identifying which compounds or inhibitory
RNAs produce particular effects, and answers typically require
further follow-up work, usually not involving imaging, to produce
a ﬁnal biological result. Another shift has been the increased
prevalence of open-source software (Eliceiri et al., 2012), although
the frequency with which investigator-provided software has been
usable by others has varied extensively. Papers have often empha-
sized the further reﬁnement of methods for benchmark datasets,
such as the original 2D HeLa dataset, with the risk that systems
become overly tuned to the benchmark.

Bioimage informatics is entering its third era, in which the goal
is the fully automated production of models of biological systems.
This includes a shift toward unsupervised machine learning, and
especially toward structure learning methods. Examples of initial
steps include building models of signaling networks from multi-
probe images WVelch, et al., 2011), identiﬁcation of regulatory

modules from gene expression images of embryos (Puniyani and
Xing, 2013), initial attempts at building image-derived generative
models of cells (Buck et al., 2012) and identiﬁcation of proteins
involved in cell shape regulation (Sailem et al., 2014). Provision of
data and software in reproducible research archives, begun al-
ready in the early 2000s, is growing. Other signiﬁcant trends are
the use of image datasets from different sources, and integration
with non-imaging data such as from genomics, transcriptomics,
proteomics and metabolomics studies.

In this third era, image analysis papers published in
Bioinformatics should reﬂect these trends and follow the journal’s
focus on analysis of systems at a molecular level. Incremental
reﬁnements to algorithms, methods requiring hand-labeling and
-tuning and studies in which the primary outputs are visualiza-
tions are all expected to give way to those producing veriﬁable
models that can be combined to produce multiscale, multicom-
ponent representations of the molecular basis and dynamics of
cell and tissue organization and behavior.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In recent years, several biomedical event extraction
(EE) systems have been developed. However, the nature of the
annotated training corpora, as well as the training process itself,
can limit the performance levels of the trained EE systems. In
particular, most event-annotated corpora do not deal adequately with
coreference. This impacts on the trained systems’ ability to recognize
biomedical entities, thus affecting their performance in extracting
events accurately. Additionally, the fact that most EE systems are
trained on a single annotated corpus further restricts their coverage.
Results: We have enhanced our existing EE system, EventMine,
in two ways. First, we developed a new coreference resolution
(CR) system and integrated it with EventMine. The standalone
performance of our CR system in resolving anaphoric references
to proteins is considerably higher than the best ranked system in
the COREF subtask of the BioNLP’11 Shared Task. Secondly, the
improved EventMine incorporates domain adaptation (DA) methods,
which extend EE coverage by allowing several different annotated
corpora to be used during training. Combined with a novel set of
methods to increase the generality and efficiency of EventMine,
the integration of both CR and DA have resulted in significant
improvements in EE, ranging between 0.5% and 3.4% F-Score.
The enhanced EventMine outperforms the highest ranked systems
from the BioNLP’09 shared task, and from the GENIA and Infectious
Diseases subtasks of the BioNLP’11 shared task.

CR system and DA methods, is available at: http://www.nactem.ac.

1 INTRODUCTION

The focus of text mining systems in biomedicine has recently shifted
from extracting named entities of biological relevance to recognizing
relations and events. Biomedical event extraction (EE) systems
have already been integrated with a number of applications, such
as semantic search, association mining for knowledge discovery,
bioprocess extraction and pathway reconstruction (Ananiadou et al.,
2010; ijrne et al., 2010; Tsuruoka et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2011). The increasing requirement for high performance EE
systems has motivated the development of several event annotated

corpora to facilitate their training [e.g. GENIA (Kim et al., 2008),
BioInfer (Pyysalo et al., 2007), GREC (Thompson et al., 2009),
BioNLP Shared Tasks 2009 (ST09) (Kim et al., 2011a) and
2011 (ST11) (Kim et al., 2011b) corpora]. Events are structured
descriptions of biological processes involving complex relationships
(e.g. angiogenesis, metabolism and reactions) between biomedical
entities, and are highly dependent on context. Events usually consist
of triggers, which are often verbs (e.g. inhibit) or nominalizations
(e. g. inhibition), and their typed arguments, which can be biomedical
entities (e.g. gene) or other events (e.g. Regulation).

Typically, EE systems ﬁnd both triggers and associated arguments,
which can present a number of challenges. Triggers are expressed
in diverse ways and their exact interpretation can depend upon
context, e.g. ‘expression of [gene ]’ is an event of type Gene
Expression, but ‘expression of [mRNA]’ is of type Transcription.
Furthermore, event arguments can be difﬁcult to detect; since
triggers are sublanguage dependent, their exact syntactic arguments
are dictated by the domain. EE systems are thus highly dependent
on the availability of training sets and external resources (e. g.
dictionaries) that can expand the trigger candidates in the training set
with semantically similar alternatives. Generally, machine learning
methods are applied to syntactic parse results to disambiguate
event types according to their surrounding contexts and to identify
relations between the syntactic and semantic arguments of triggers.

There are two important issues that are scarcely dealt with by
existing EE systems. First, the usual method of training on only
a single annotated corpus can limit the coverage and scalability
of the system. Secondly, coreference resolution (CR) is required
for the correct interpretation of certain event arguments. This is
illustrated in Figure 1, in which there are two coreferential links.
The ﬁrst link involves the mention this gene and its antecedent jun-
B, whereas the second concerns the mention that and its antecedent
expression. There are two gene expression events in the sentence, i.e.
jun-B expression and jun-C expression, which can only be correctly
recognized if these coreferential links are identiﬁed and resolved.

This article reports on two enhancements that have been made
to an existing EE system, EventMine (Miwa et al., 2010b), to
address the issues outlined above. First, we constructed a new CR
system, whose performance in resolving anaphoric references to

genes and proteins considerably exceeds that of the best participating
system in the Protein Coreference task (COREF) of ST11, which
focussed on protein/gene name CR. Subsequent integration of
our new CR system with EventMine clearly demonstrates an
improvement in state-of—the—art EE performance on several event
corpora. Secondly, our incorporation of domain adaptation (DA)
methods into EventMine, which make it possible to use information
from multiple annotated corpora when training the system, have
been shown to further boost EE performance. The enhanced version
of EventMine, incorporating both CR and DA, outperforms the
highest ranked systems participating in ST09, and the GENIA and
Infectious Diseases (ID) subtasks of ST11.

2 RELATED WORK
2.1 Biomedical EE

Driven by an increasing interest in biomedical EE, event corpora
such as GENIA, BioInfer and GREC have been complemented
by community shared tasks (STs), i.e. ST09 and ST11, which
have provided standard evaluation benchmarks for BB. In ST09,
the main task (GE09) focussed on event types relating to protein
biology in the GENIA corpus. ST11 included several tasks: GE11,
an extension of GE09, incorporated full text annotations in addition
to abstracts, EPI [EPIgenetics and post-translational modiﬁcations
(PTM)] concerned events relating to epigenetic change, and ID
dealt with infectious diseases in full texts. Biomedical events in
all ST tasks consist of: event types, e.g. Binding and Regulation;
trigger expressions, e. g. bind and expression; arguments with entity
types assigned, e.g. p53: Protein; argument roles (trigger-argument
relations), e.g. Theme and Site; and ﬁnally information relating to
event modiﬁcation, e. g. negation and speculation. Figure 2 illustrates
the event representation used in GE09.

State-of—the-art EE systems use a number of machine learning
methods, including pipeline approaches (ijrne and Salakoski,
2011; Miwa et al., 2010b), dual decomposition-based models
(Riedel and McCallum, 2011), stacking-based multiple model
integration approaches (Riedel et al. , 2011) and search-based models
(Vlachos and Craven, 2011).

2.2 Use of external resources in EE

Four machine learning-based and two rule-based systems were built
to approach the COREF task. (Kim et al. , 20110) adapted a machine
learning-based CR system originally developed for newswire text,

 In this study we hypothesized that
the phosphorylation of TRAF2 inhibits binding to the CD40 cytoplasmic domain.

Fig. 3. EventMine EE pipeline. Documents used as input to the system must
be pre-annotated with entities. In this case, TRAF2 and CD40 have already
been identiﬁed as Protein

by disabling several domain-speciﬁc features. This system achieved
the best performance of all participating systems (i.e. 35% F -Score
for protein/ gene name CR). (Tu ggener et al. , 2011) developed a rule-
based system that used a salience measure based on the output of
a dependency parser. Since the general performance of all the CR
systems was low, none of the ST11 participants made use of CR
results to assist with the BE process.

Independently of the COREF task, (Yoshikawa et al., 2011)
trained a CR system on the event-focussed coreference annotation in
GENIA. They incorporated the CR results into their argument role
detection system (based on Markov logic networks), which resulted
in an improvement in the performance of role detection. However,
the effect of CR on event recognition performance and the use of
corpora other than GENIA are still open problems.

DA methods have rarely been applied in the context of EB.
(Riedel and McCallum, 2011) used instance-based DA to tackle
the ID task, resulting in the highest performance among the ST
participants. They supplemented event instances from the ID corpus
with instances from the GE11 corpus, after tuning the combination
settings on the development set. (Vlachos and Craven, 2011) applied
feature-based DA to the GE11 task, which improved the F -Score
by 0.41% on the test set. They incorporated additional features
speciﬁc to the target text types, i.e. abstracts and full texts, into
their system. DA thus constitutes a promising means to improve EE
results, although further research is required to investigate how best
to transfer information from different corpora to the target corpus.

3 EVENT EXTRACTION

In Section 3.1, we provide an overview of our EE system, EventMine,
whereas in Section 3.2, we explain several general modiﬁcations that have
been made.

3.1 EventMine

EventMine is a pipeline-based EE system, which extracts events from
documents that already contain named entity annotations (e.g. Protein).
Figure 3 illustrates the four different modules of the system, i.e. the
trigger/entity detector, argument detector, multi-argument event detector and
modiﬁcation detector, together with sample outputs of each module. The
trigger/entity detector identiﬁes words (i.e. event triggers and entities) that
are potential fragments of an event. Each word is assigned either an event
type (e.g. Phosphorylation) if it is an event trigger, or otherwise an entity

type (e.g. Entity). The categories assigned by this detector can be collapsed
into more general types (e.g. PositiveﬂVegative Regulation, Regulation —>
REGULATION) to increase the number of training instances and to facilitate
the application of DA methods (see Section 4.3). The argument detector
identiﬁes possible trigger-argument pairs. Each argument can be either an
entity or the trigger of another event, and is assigned a semantic role type (e. g.
Theme and Cause). The multi-argument event detector combines multiple
trigger-argument pairs found by the argument detector to create complete
event structures, and assigns an event type to them. The modiﬁcation detector
assigns modiﬁcation information (i.e. negation and speculation) to each
event. Each module solves multi-class multi-label classiﬁcation problems
by applying a one-versus-rest SVM (Fan et al., 2008) to the output of the
preceding module in the pipeline (except for the trigger/entity detector).

EventMine uses ﬁve feature extraction functions to extract features
representing a word or pair of words, together with their contexts. The
word feature function extracts the surface representation of a word,
including character types (e.g. number and symbol), n-grams (n = 1;2; 3; 4)
of characters, base form and part-of—speech (POS). The neighbouring feature
function extracts all 2—step dependency paths from a word, represented by the
features extracted by the word feature function, plus word and dependency
n-grams (n = 2; 3; 4), word n-grams (n = 2; 3) and dependency n-grams (n =
2), where each word is represented by its base form. The word n-gram feature
function extracts n-grams (n =1;2;3;4) of words within a window of three
words before or after the target word. Each word is represented by its base
form, POS and its relative position (before or after the word). The pair
n-gram feature function extracts n-grams (n:1;2;3;4) of words within a
window of three words before/after the ﬁrst/last word in the pair. Each word
is represented by its base form, POS and its relative position (before, between
or after the pair). The shortest path feature function extracts the shortest
paths between a pair of words, represented by the path length, word n- grams
(n:2;3;4), dependency n-grams (n:2;3;4), consecutive word n-grams
(n = 1;2; 3) representing governor-dependent relationships, and edge walks
(word-dependency-word), vertex walks (dependency-word-dependency) and
their sub-structures. Each word is represented by its base form.

These functions are combined in different ways to make features for each
module, as shown in Table 1. Features are normalized using the L2—norm

(Graf et al., 2003), both at the level of the feature extraction functions, and
globally. EventMine accounts for the output of multiple syntactic parsers by
extracting features from each parser’s output separately. Following (Miwa
et al., 2010b), we have used both the Enju parser (Miyao et al., 2009) and
the GDep parser (Sagae and Tsujii, 2007).

3.2 Generalization and modiﬁcation of EventMine

Prior to incorporating CR and DA into a EventMine, several modiﬁcations
were made to its core functionality, both to enhance its performance and to
increase its applicability to a wide variety of EB tasks.

First, the system was generalized, so that training can be carried out on
different annotated corpora, which may contain a variety of event types and
structures. Since each module is machine learning based, this modiﬁcation
only required a small amount of effort. Secondly, since the system uses
several rich feature extraction functions, the memory usage is potentially
high. Feature Hashing (FH) has been incorporated to map the features used
by the system to a smaller dimension (limited to 220 features) by using
a hash function (Shi et al., 2009), which results in a minimal decrease
in performance (0.1% F -Score). By incorporating FH, the memory usage
associated with constructing models for GE09 is reduced by three-quarters.
Thirdly, cross validation (CV) is utilized to train each module. A pipeline
model tends to overﬁt the training set by using it several times. To reduce
this effect, each module is trained using the predictions made within the
test folds of a 10-fold CV run on the previous module in the pipeline.
The same partitioning of the data are used for CV in every module. CV
reduces the amount of data available to train the subsequent modules, and
is thus ineffective when there are only a small number of training instances.
Fourthly, trigger ﬁltering (TF) is used to help to reduce computation time,
by selecting only those trigger/entity candidates whose base form matches
that of the head word of an annotation in the training set. TF halves
the time required to construct models for GE09. Fifthly, dictionary-based
trigger expansion (DTE) increases the features that are shared among the
training instances and alleviates the problem of unknown words. Using
dictionaries, DTE expands trigger/entity candidates with related words (e. g.
synonyms) and also expands the word feature function by adding words
related to a candidate as additional features. Related words were found Via
the ‘hypemyms’ and ‘similar to’ relations in WordNet (Fellbaum, 1998),
in addition to transcategorial operations (e.g. degrade—>degradation) and
synonyms in the UMLS Specialist Lexicon (Bodenreider, 2004). Sixthly
and ﬁnally, a simpliﬁed version of the trigger/entity detector (STD) reduces
computation time by omitting a feature extraction step from the original
system (Miwa et al., 2010b), which was found to have no effect on overall
performance.

4 INCORPORATING EXTERNAL RESOURCES
INTO EE

In this section, we describe the two types of external resources that have
been incorporated within EventMine. Our new CR system is described
in Section 4.1, whereas its integration with EventMine is explained in
Section 4.2. In Section 4.3, we outline the DA methods that have been used
to incorporate information from external annotated corpora into EventMine.

4.1 Rule-based coreference resolution system

Our novel rule-based CR system identiﬁes coreferential links between genes
and proteins, i.e. mentions and their antecedents. Using the COREF task
training data, a set of rules was developed based on the output of the Enju
parser, which consists of syntactic trees and predicate-argument structures.
This is in contrast to the dependency parse results used by (Tuggener et al.,
2011). Three rule-based detectors are used, i.e. a mention candidate detector,
an antecedent candidate detector and a coreferential link detector.

The mention candidate detector identiﬁes words and phrases that are
potential mentions of genes and proteins. First, a full list of mention

 

1761

M.Miwa et al.

 

candidates is extracted, consisting of all noun phrases (NPs) with articles
(e.g. these transcription factors), pronouns (e.g. they), possessive pronouns
(e.g. its), relative pronouns (e.g. which and whose) and complementizers
(e.g. that). Secondly, a ﬁlter is applied to remove mention candidates that
are unlikely to refer to genes and proteins, i.e. NPs without the, this, that,
these or those as their articles (e.g. our method), NPs whose head word is
not one of the three most frequent head words in the training set (i.e. protein,
gene and factor), NPs that contain words other than head words, articles and
quantiﬁers (e.g. the three interacting proteins), pleonastic pronouns (e.g. it
in ‘it is clear that ...’) and personal pronouns except for it and they (e. g. we).
This ﬁltering step causes a large reduction in the number of false positive
mentions found by the system, with only a minimal loss of true positive
mentions. It also simpliﬁes the detection of coreferential links.

The antecedent candidate detector selects all NPs apart from: full mention
candidates found by the mention candidate detector, those containing
sentence clauses and those sharing their head words with other larger NPs.

The coreferential link detector links each mention to its most suitable
antecedent candidate. For complementizers and relative clauses, the parser
output is used. For deﬁnite NPs and pronouns, a set of rules is applied
to rank potential antecedents, and the top ranked antecedent in the list is
linked to the mention. For each pair of possible antecedents, the following
rules [motivated by (Raghunathan et al., 2010)] are applied, in the sequence
indicated, until a particular rule distinguishes a more likely antecedent: Do
both antecedents precede the mention? Is one of the antecedent-containing
sentence clauses closer to clause containing the mention than the other? Do
both of the antecedents share grammatical number with the mention? Are
both antecedents not i-within-i (antecedents cannot be children of mentions,
and Vice versa)? Do both antecedents share head words with the mention?
If both antecedents occur in the same sentence clause as the mention,
which occurs closest to the mention? If both antecedents occur in a single
clause, but not in the same clause as the mention, which is closest to the
mention?

4.2 Incorporation of coreference resolution

The output of our CR system is used in two ways in the enhanced version
of EventMine. First, parse result modiﬁcation (PR) modiﬁes the original
parse results so that mentions and their antecedents share dependencies, i.e.
dependencies from/to mentions are added to antecedents, and Vice versa.
Figure 4 illustrates how parse results are changed through the application
of PR. In the modiﬁed parse tree, the two coreferring entities become
closer, in terms of their dependencies. Secondly, feature extension (FE)
extends the set of features used during EE, by making use of the CR
results. Speciﬁcally, features of genes/proteins detected as events argument
are extended by including features associated with all of their coreferential
mentions. The latter modiﬁcation helps the system to ﬁnd explicit relations
between participants.

4.3 Domain adaptation with external corpora

The improved EventMine uses two DA methods to allow the information
annotated in the main training corpus (target corpus) to be supplemented
with information from other annotated corpora (source corpora).

The ﬁrst DA method is instance weighting (IW). If there are annotated
source (src) corpora whose event types and possible arguments match those

Fig. 4. Parse result modiﬁcation (PR) using the CR output. In addition to
the dependencies identiﬁed in the original parser output (upper solid arrows),
shared dependencies are generated between the mention its and its antecedent
SLP-76 (lower dotted arrows)

in the target (tgt) corpus, event instances from the source corpora could
be added to the training instances from the target corpus to increase the
amount of training data. However, the EE results could become skewed if
the distributions of positive and negative instances are different in the source
and target corpora. To reduce the potential skewing effect, different weights
are assigned to the positive (+) and negative (—) instances in the source and
target corpora by modifying the objective function as follows.

minw éwTw+ Z Z C5251“- (1)
l={+,—}c={src,tgt} i

Here, K represents the loss function in SVM, l represents labels, c represents
corpora and Cs represent the weights for the instances. The ratio of positive
to negative instances in the source corpora is made consistent with the
ratio in the target corpus, by setting Cs to satisfy Csjcnsjc: Cg'r'cng'h: =
CtTgtntTgt: ng'tnjgt. The conditions Ct; =1 and Ct; = Cgir'c are used for
simplicity, and ensuring that Csjc-nsjc = CS‘Ir'c-ng';c eases problems caused by
an imbalanced distribution of positive and negative examples.

The second DA method concerns the use of a stacking model (SM). If a
source corpus shares only a subset of its event types and arguments with the
target corpus, then it is not appropriate to add training instances directly from
the source corpus, because positive instances in the source corpora could
correspond to negative instances in the target corpus. Instead, each module of
EventMine can be trained separately on the source corpus, and its output can
be incorporated as additional features within the same module trained on the
target corpus. Also, since the multi-argument event detector shares features
with the argument detector, as detailed in Table 1, the outputs of argument
detectors trained on different source corpora can provide additional features
to the multi-argument event detector trained on the target corpus.

5 EVALUATION

Our CR system has been evaluated on the COREF task data, whereas
the enhanced EventMine has been evaluated on four different tasks,
i.e. GE09, GE11, EPI and ID. The task and evaluation settings are
described in Sections 5.1 and 5.2. We then provide the evaluation
results in Section 5.3, compare the results with other systems in
Section 5.4, and analyze errors in the results in Section 5.5.

5.1 Corpora and task settings

GE09/11 both deal with nine event types involving proteins,
consisting of ﬁve simple event types (e.g. Gene Expression and
Phosphorylation), one Binding type (Binding) and three Regulation
types (PositiveﬂVegative Regulation and Regulation). Simple event
types require a single core Theme argument, Binding events require
an arbitrary number of core Theme arguments and Regulation
events can include recursive event structures. EPI deﬁnes 15 event
types relating to Protein, consisting of seven simple event types
(e.g. Acetylation, Phosphorylation and Methylation), their inverse
event types (e.g. Deacetylation is the inverse of Acetylation)
and one Regulation event type (Catalysis, a subtype of Positive
Regulation). The event types in EPI are largely disjoint from those
in the other corpora. ID covers events relating to ﬁve named
entities (e.g. Protein Chemical and Organism) and deﬁnes the
same event types as GE09/11, with the addition of Process, which
requires no arguments. All the tasks cover secondary arguments
(i.e. Site/Location arguments) for certain event types and also
modiﬁcations (i.e. negation and speculation). Table 2 provides some
statistics regarding the annotated corpora used in each task.
GE09/11 deﬁned three tasks: Task 1 required the identiﬁcation
of core arguments (Theme and Cause), Task 2 was concerned with
ﬁnding secondary arguments, and Task 3 required the detection of

since it was undertaken by all participating systems. EPI and ID
deﬁned both a core task (the same as Task 1 in GE09/11), and a
full task, which additionally required modiﬁcations and secondary
arguments to be found. We focus on the full task, since its results
were considered as the primary evaluation metric for EPI and ID.

5.2 Evaluation settings

Each corpus was split into sentences by the GENIA sentence splitter
(Seetre et al., 2007), and was subsequently parsed by both the Enju
2.4.1 parser with the GENIA model, and the GDep beta2 parser. The
CR system used the Enju parse results, whereas EventMine used the
results of both parsers. Liblinear—j ava (Fan et al., 2008; http://www.
bwaldvogel.de/liblinear-java/) was used for classiﬁcation, with the
bias term set.

Certain semantic types were generalized following trigger/entity
detection, to increase both the number of training instances and the
number of event representations that were shared among corpora, as
explained in Section 3.1. In terms of triggers, all the Regulation event
types were collapsed into a single type, REGULATION, whereas
Phosphorylation in GE09/11 and ID, and simple event types in EPI,
were generalized as PT M . In terms of arguments, all event and entity
types were generalized as EVENT and ENTITY, respectively.

Of the newly introduced methods described in Section 3.2, FH,
TF and STD were utilized for all tasks. CV and DTE were used
for all tasks except EPI. CV considerably reduced the recall for this
task, due to the small size of the EPI corpus, and the incorporation
of DTE did not improve the performance. The version of EventMine
that incorporates these methods is referred as to ‘the base system’.

Unless otherwise stated, the evaluation metrics follow those
originally deﬁned for each task. Each task provided training,
development and test sets. Following (ijrne and Salakoski, 2011),
EventMine was ﬁrst trained on the training set for each task, and its
performance was evaluated on the development set, to determine the

optimal settings (e.g. CV and DA). Subsequently, the system was
trained on both the training and development sets using the optimal
settings, and then evaluated on the test set using the evaluation
systems provided by the ST organizers.

5.3 Evaluation of EventMine with external resources

Table 3 shows the performance of our CR system on the COREF
task data. The results of the best performing system in the the
original COREF task evaluation (Kim et al., 20110) are also shown,
demonstrating that our system performs signiﬁcantly better. The
results obtained on the development set, using both exact matching
and head word matching (the latter are shown in parentheses)
revealed that our mention detector found 81.4% (81.4%) of gold
standard annotated mentions, our antecedent detector found 57.1%
(99.6%) of gold standard antecedents, and the coreferential link
detector found 70.2% (79.7%) of gold standard links between
mentions and antecedents. In comparison, the recall of (Kim et al.,
20110) is much lower than ours in detecting exact antecedents
(41.2%), but marginally higher in detecting mentions (85.1%).

The positive effects of incorporating CR into the BE pipeline
when EventMine is trained on the GE09 data are summarized in
Table 4. Both CR integration methods introduced in Section 4.2,
i.e. PR and FE, improved event recognition performance for all
event types. The best results are achieved when the two methods are
combined. Following (Kim et al., 2011a), we performed a statistical
signiﬁcance test on the development set, using the approximate
randomization method. The difference between the best results
obtained using the CR integration methods (+PR+FE; 58.81%) and
the results obtained using the original version of EventMine (EM10)
(Miwa et al., 2010a), 57.22%, is statistically signiﬁcant (p < 0.05).
Although we cannot run a signiﬁcance test on the test set, since
gold standard annotation was not provided, the report in (Kim
et al., 2011a) strongly suggests that the 1.99% difference in F -Score
between the results of +PR+FE (58.27%) and EM10 (56.28%)
when applied to the test set is statistically signiﬁcant.

Table 5 summarizes the results obtained when both DA and
CR are incorporated into the BE process, for each of the four
event corpora introduced above. The DA methods introduced in
Section 4.3 were only used when training EventMine on the EPI
and ID corpora, since these corpora contain many fewer event
instances than GE09/11 (Table 2). We did not use other event

corpora (e.g. BioInfer and GREC) as source corpora, since they
are much smaller than GE09/11, with different event types and
representations. For the ID task, IW was used, with the GE11
training and development sets as the source corpus, since ID and
GE11 share all event types except for Process. For the EPI task, SM
was adopted, using the ID model trained with GE11 as the source
model, since EPI shares only the Phosphorylation and Catalysis
event types with the other corpora. The use of these DA methods
resulted in improvements over the base system of 1.3% F -Score
for EPI, and 1.8% for ID. These results are promising, given that
EPI shares few event types with the source model and that ID
contains entities with different semantic classes to those in GE11.
For comparative purposes, simple addition of instances from GE11,
in combination with the +PR+FE setting, achieved an F -Score of
50.58% for the ID task, which is 0.66% lower than when IW is used
(51.24%). This reveals that the distributions of GE11 and ID are
similar, but not identical. A further experiment involved applying
IW to GE11, with ID as the source corpus. However, this caused
a 1.1% drop in F -Score, as GE11 does not contain the event type
Process or named entities other than Protein. Table 5 also shows that
by supplementing DA methods with CR results, EE performance
can be further improved. A larger improvement can be observed for
GE11 and ID (which both include full texts) than for GE09 and EPI.
This seems reasonable, given that event descriptions in full texts are
less restricted by space than in abstracts, resulting in more frequent
occurrences of coreference.

5.4 Comparison with other systems

At the bottom of Table 4, we compare the performance of EventMine
(with the +PR+FE conﬁguration) on the GE09 task with the highest
performing system on the task, i.e. UMass (Riedel and McCallum,
2011), which uses a dual-decomposition—based joint model for BB.
Tables 6 and 7 provide a comparison of EventMine with the two
top performing systems in ST11, i.e. FAUST (Riedel et al., 2011)
and UTurku (ijrne and Salakoski, 2011), on the GE11, EPI and
ID tasks. FAUST is an extension of UMass, which uses the output
of a dependency-parsing-based EE system, whereas UTurku is a
pipeline-based system, whose modules are similar to those of EM10,
but they use different set of features. For all three ST11 tasks,
EventMine uses the +PR+FE+DA conﬁguration, which achieved
the best results on the development sets, as shown in Table 5.

The tables show that EventMine is the only system that can
achieve state-of—the-art performance on all corpora and with
different types of events. The relatively small differences between
the results for GE09 (Table 5) and GE11 abstracts (Table 7)
demonstrate that the general performance of EventMine remains

constant, even when the training data includes full texts as well as
abstracts. The high level of performance on full texts (GE11 full
texts and ID, see Table 7) was partly due to the integration of CR,
which has been shown to be effective on full texts in the development
sets (Table 5). EventMine also performed particularly well on events
with multiple arguments, such as Binding and Regulation, since the
multi-argument event detector is speciﬁcally tailored to detecting
of events with multiple arguments, as described in Section 3.1.
EventMine slightly underperformed other systems in the detection
of modiﬁcations. The performance was affected both by the use
of CV, which reduced the upper bound of the recall, and the
lower number of training examples than for other modules. For
instance, although the use of CV with the base system resulted in
an improvement in F —Score of 1.4% for EE, it also reduced the
performance of modiﬁcation detection by 5.8% F -Score for the
GE09 task. Modiﬁcation detection in the ID task was also affected
by DA, since the frequency of modiﬁcations in the GE11 corpus is
three times larger than those found in the ID corpus.

Boosting automatic event extraction from the literature

 

5.5 Error analysis

We analysed 100 errors (56 missing events and 44 incorrect events)
produced by the system (+PR+FE) when it was applied to the
development set for Task 1 in GE11. Missing events are cases where
the system was unable to ﬁnd gold standard event structures, causing
false negatives (FNs). The trigger/entity, argument and multi-
argument event detectors missed 22, 28 and 6 events, respectively.
Incorrectly recognized events correspond to events that either only
partially match manually annotated gold standard events, or else are
spuriously recognized. These caused both false positives (FPs) and
FNs. Of the 44 incorrect events, 11 were assigned the wrong event
type, 19 contained incorrect arguments, whereas the remaining 14
were completely spurious, which caused FPs.

We found two major problems, which require novel solutions.
The ﬁrst problem involves inference. As an example, consider the
expression aﬁ‘ect in ‘A affected B’, which could correspond to any
of the three Regulation event types, if information that can be
inferred from surrounding events or facts is not taken into account.
The second problem is concerned with missing semantic types of
NPs. For example, the trigger expression express is annotated as
Gene Expression in ‘the fetal genes are expressed’ but as Positive
Regulation in ‘expressing the fetal developmental program’. Both
cases have fetal as an event argument, which is annotated as Protein.
However, genes and program are not annotated with their semantic
types. Assigning semantic types to these NPs could help with the
disambiguation of the event types.

6 CONCLUSION

This article has reported on a number of enhancements to the
EventMine EE system. First, several methods were incorporated to
increase both the generality and efﬁciency of the system. Secondly,
a newly constructed, rule-based CR system was integrated into
EventMine, and DA methods were applied to utilize information
from multiple annotated corpora. The CR system considerably
outperformed systems that participated in the GE11 COREF task.
The incorporation of CR and DA into the BE process signiﬁcantly
improved the performance of EventMine on four different event-
annotated corpora, demonstrating the adaptable nature of the system.
The results surpass those of systems that participated in the GE09
task of ST09 and the GE11 and ID tasks of ST11.

As future work, we will explore further novel ways of integrating
external resources, by reducing the effect of differences among
corpora. We will also investigate how EventMine can be embedded
into other applications, e.g. semantic search engines and pathway
curation and reconstruction systems.

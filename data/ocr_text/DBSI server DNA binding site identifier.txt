Abstract

Summary: Protein—nucleic acid interactions are among the most important intermolecular inter—
actions in the regulation of cellular events. Identifying residues involved in these interactions from
protein structure alone is an important challenge. Here we introduce the webserver interface to
DNA Binding Site Identifier (DBSI), a powerful structure—based SVM model for the prediction and
visualization of DNA binding sites on protein structures. DBSI has been shown to be a top—
performing model to predict DNA binding sites on the surface of a protein or peptide and shows

promise in predicting RNA binding sites.

Availability and Implementation: Server is available at http://dbsi.mitcheII—Iab.org

1 Introduction

Protein—nucleic acid interactions are crucial to cellular events in the
regulation of transcription, DNA replication and repair; and RNA
splicing and post—transcriptional regulation. Identifying residues
involved in nucleic acid binding is crucial to understand function.
Cocrystal structures are often unavailable, and DNA/RNA binding
sites may not be easily discernable from the protein sequence or un—
bound structure.

Here we present the web interface to DBSI (http://dbsi.mitchell—
lab.org), a machine learning approach to classify surface residues as
binders or non—binders of DNA. DBSI employs sequence— and
structure—based features encompassing a range of physical, chemical,
geometric and evolutionary properties of the protein surface (Zhu
et 61]., 2013a). DBSI also implements microenvironment features
that allow for small—scale structural perturbation and the role of
non—local cooperative effects.

The webserver greatly simplifies the use of DBSI, eliminating the
need for downloading, installing and configuring third-party soft-
ware and requiring the upload of only one file. The DBSI server fa-
cilitates online visualization of results, and it ensures privacy of user
jobs.

2 Input and output

To use the DBSI server, the user first generates an electrostatic map
of their structure (after stripping off heteroatoms) using the
CHARMM—GUI (Jo et 61]., 2008). The resulting PBEQ archive (a tgz
file) comprises the sole input to our simple and intuitive user inter—
face. In order to ensure the most accurate predictions, three values
in step 2 of the CHARMM—GUI submission should be defined dif—
ferently from the default values (epsP:2.0, Dcel_c: 1.0,
Dcel_f= 0.5).

The DBSI algorithm computes a set of sequence— and structure—
based features and generates DNA binding predictions for each sur-
face residue and a score that quantifies confidence that the residue
will bind DNA, using a distance cutoff of 5.0  between the binding
partners. The interface allows users to track the status of their jobs
in the queue and provides a private link to results. Links to results
can also be sent to the (optional) email address provided in the job
submission screen. Upon job completion, users may visualize DBSI
predictions within the browser using JSmol (Fig. 1D) (Hanson et 61].,
2013). Users may also download a PDB file with the DBSI scores
built into the B—factor column, allowing for visualization using
PyMol or other molecular viewers(Fig. 1E). A text—based results file

ections for generating the tgz files, using the server and interpreting
results are provided on the DBSI Server website. The DBSI server
typically takes around 12 minutes for a 200 residue—sized protein,
and is faster on machines with a solid state drive (Supplementary
Table S5).

3 Results and performance

DBSI has been developed through a process of rigorous feature selec—
tion, model parameter optimization and internal 5—fold cross—
validation. DBSI has been tested on an independent dataset compris—
ing 206 high—resolution structures of DNA—binding proteins, showing
it to outperform other available models. The AUC of 0.88 obtained
by DBSI meets or exceeds that of other recently tested models, with
our AUC being computed as an absolute number across the entire
dataset rather than the ‘per protein average AUC’ used in Miao and
Westhof (2015), which does not lead to a well—defined classification
cutoff. Testing on a dataset with structures of complexed and free
DNA binders (Andrabi et al., 2014) has demonstrated that DBSI is
very robust to conformational changes induced by binding and can
predict binding sites on disordered proteins (Supplementary Tables S3
and S4). Details on testing, statistical analyses and comparisons with
other models are available (Zhu et al., 2013a).

The DBSI model has been tested on a range of proteins and pep—
tides that bind nucleic acids (including large protein complexes such
as histones, transcription factors, restriction enzymes, higher-order
oligomers, RNA-binding proteins) with promising results (Table 1).
Figure 1 shows DBSI results for DNA— and RNA—binding proteins as
well as a short peptide. DBSI makes accurate binding site predictions
for DNA- (Fig. 1A and D) and RNA- (Fig. 1B and E) binding mol-
ecules of varying size and function, from small peptides to large
complexes like the nucleosome. We find that for a set of 19 RNA—
binding protein structures from the Nucleic Acid Database (Berman
et al., 1992), the DBSI server correctly identifies binding sites with
high accuracy and specificity, but has a lower sensitivity than
observed for DNA—binding proteins. This suggests that sites pre—
dicted by DBSI are very likely to bind RNA, but the current model
may misclassify weaker RNA binding sites. We are currently per—
forming more thorough testing for a larger set of RNA—specific ex—
amples and will extend the DBSI model in the future for optimized

performance on RNA-binding proteins. A list of the RNA binding
examples and performance metrics is given in Supplementary
Table S1.

In the case of short antimicrobial peptides (Supplementary Table
S2), where DNA—binding is thought to be important to activity
(Guilhelmelli et al., 2013), DBSI is able to correctly predict residues
believed to bind DNA. While it is difficult to verify the DNA-bind-
ing residues without structures of the peptide—DNA complexes, mo—
lecular dynamics simulations (Jana et al., 2013) and other studies
(Wang et al., 2014) suggest that DBSI correctly identifies key bind-
ing residues. For example, DBSI identifies residue Arg23 as an im-
portant binder of DNA on LL-37 (Fig. 1F).

Predictions from DBSI strongly reinforced the observation that,
in contrast to its homologs, the important mitochondrial protein
COQ9 was unlikely to bind DNA (Lohman et al., 2014). This is sig-
nificant, as COQ9, a member of the TetR family of regulators, pos—
sesses the characteristic conserved Helix-Turn-Helix DNA binding
domain; COQ9 is the only known protein with a TetR transcription
factor fold that appears to have lost DNA binding ability, something
readily supported by the difference in DBSI predictions between
COQ9 and the transcription factor FadR. DBSI has also be used to
predict interaction sites for chemically similar molecules to DNA,
such as heparin, as evidenced by its strong performance in CAPRI
challenge 57 (Zhu et al., 2013b).

With DBSI’s proven performance in predicting nucleic acid bind—
ing sites, we believe that the ease of use of the webserver coupled
with the simple and powerful visualization tools for analysis will
make the DBSI server a widely used tool for the identification of key
residues in protein—nucleic acid interfaces, thereby aiding the study
of interactions between proteins with DNA/RNA and other chem—
ically similar molecules.

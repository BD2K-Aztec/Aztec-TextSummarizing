ABSTRACT

Summary: JABAWS is a web services framework that simplifies
the deployment of web services for bioinformatics. JABAWS:MSA
provides services for five multiple sequence alignment (MSA)
methods (Probcons, T—coffee, Muscle, Mafft and ClustalW), and is
the system employed by the Jalview multiple sequence analysis
workbench since version 2.6. A fully functional, easy to set up server
is provided as a Virtual Appliance (VA), which can be run on most
operating systems that support a virtualization environment such
as VMware or Oracle VirtualBox. JABAWS is also distributed as
a Web Application aRchive (WAR) and can be configured to run
on a single computer and/or a cluster managed by Grid Engine,
LSF or other queuing systems that support DRMAA. JABAWS:MSA
provides clients full access to each application’s parameters, allows
administrators to specify named parameter preset combinations and
execution limits for each application through simple configuration
files. The JABAWS command-line client allows integration of
JABAWS services into conventional scripts.

Availability and Implementation: JABAWS is made freely available
under the Apache 2 license and can be obtained from:

1 INTRODUCTION

The explosion in biological data volume, diversity and complexity,
has been paralleled by the development of computational methods
to aid data analysis. Locally installed copies of programs give full
access to their capabilities, and the ability to run long CPU or
memory intensive jobs. However, conﬁguring software to install
easily on a range of operating systems is challenging. Instead, many
developers make their techniques available through a custom web
page, or increasingly as a web service, which provides a ﬂexible,
programmable and scriptable (Hull et al., 2006) middle ground
between installing software locally and accessing Via a web browser.
There is now a rich ecosystem of public web services (Bhagat
et al., 2010), but they do not always meet the needs of users.
Their interfaces may have limited functionality and even the biggest
service providers, such as EBI and NCBI, limit the computational
resources (memory/CPU) available to an individual so that total
demand can be met. Web services at the University of Dundee were
created in 2005 as part of the JalView project (Waterhouse et al.,
2009) to provide its users access to ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007),

Mafft (Katoh and Toh, 2008) and Muscle (Edgar, 2004) multiple
alignment programs and the J Pred secondary structure predictor
(Cole et al., 2008). Although convenient, these suffer from the
same public service limitations, and many of the >20 000 users
of J alView requested the ability to run alignments locally on their
workstation or to deploy the same services on their institution’s
cluster. Although locally installable web service systems such as
Opal 2 (Krishnan et al., 2009) and SoapLab 2 (Senger et al., 2008)
are available, they require signiﬁcant investment in time or expertise
to install. In contrast, the J ABAWS:MSA system introduced here, is
an easy to install web services solution for multiple alignment that
can run on a desktop or laptop computer, local server or computer
cluster. J ABAWS:MSA’s rich interface lets the user track execution
progress, retrieve results as a data structure instead of ﬁle(s) and
provides SOAP services conforming to WS-I Basic Proﬁle 1.2/2.0.
While developed primarily for the J alView Desktop, these can be
scripted against, and a command-line client for this purpose is
distributed with the system.

2 THE SERVER

The JABAWS:MSA server and command-line client are both
implemented in Java, but the server exploits native programs to
provide ClustalW (Larkin et al., 2007), Muscle (Edgar, 2004),
Probcons (Do et al., 2005), T—coffee (Notredame et al., 2000) and
Mafft (Katoh and Toh, 2008) alignment services. These programs
can be difﬁcult to compile or incompatible with some operating
systems, so a range of JABAWS:MSA distributions have been
created to suit most environments. The basic JABAWS:MSA
distribution is a pre-conﬁgured Java Web Application aRchive
(WAR) conforming to the Servlet 2.4 speciﬁcation, optionally
bundled with the source and prebuilt binaries of its dependent
bioinformatics programs. This option is most appropriate for
experienced users wishing to set up multiple alignment services
for their group or institution, or those working on Linux
or Mac operating systems. For most other users, a ‘Virtual
Appliance’ (VA) (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Virtual_appliance)
is supplied that is built on TurnKey Linux and contains a
fully operational JABAWS:MSA server. This can be run on a
freely available virtualization product such as VMware player
(http://www.vmware.com/products/player) or Oracle VirtualBox
(http://www.Virtualbox.org).

3 JABAWS:MSA CONFIGURATION OPTIONS

A native JABAWS:MSA installation can be tightly integrated with
the local computing infrastructure. It allows ﬁne-grained control

over the calculations to be run on the server through three user-
editable conﬁguration ﬁles: ‘Parameters’, ‘Limits’ and ‘Presets’,
for each alignment method. The Parameters ﬁle deﬁnes command-
line parameters that are supported by the method, its valid ranges
and which parameters are mandatory, while the Presets ﬁle allows
combinations of parameter settings to be given a name and brief
description to explain their use. For example, Mafft has six
alternative presets, enabling a range of accuracy or speed-oriented
options. The Limits ﬁle speciﬁes the maximum length and number
of sequences allowed for a method, and separate limits may be set
for calculations to be run on the same server as Tomcat, or via
a cluster queuing system. Further conﬁguration ﬁles centralize the
deﬁnition of application-speciﬁc directories, and any command-line
ﬂags needed to enable J ABAWS to interact correctly with a queuing
system. Together, these permit J ABAWS to operate efﬁciently in
nearly any compute environment, by executing jobs on the local
machine, on a cluster through a queuing system or on whichever
resource is most appropriate according to a job’s size and the
availability of local CPUs.

4 THE CLIENTS

Web services provided by a JABAWS:MSA installation can be
accessed from any programming language, providing libraries are
available for the consumption of SOAP web services. The service
interface allows a client to discover the execution limits, command
line parameters and named presets for a program, and once a
calculation is submitted, check on its progress by retrieving any
text normally output to the console by the program. Importantly,
data structures and formats for all services are standardized, so the
same client can submit data to, and handle the results from any
of the alignment programs provided by any J ABAWS:MSA server.
A lightweight, ready to use J ABAWS:MSA command-line client is
provided which allows access to J ABAWS alignment services. The
client is Java based, and is also a useful guide for those who wish
to develop or adapt their own clients or test new JABAWS:MSA
installations. For non-programmers, a graphical client is available
within J alView 2.6. This client connects to a J ABAWS :MSA server to
discover which services are available, their parameters and presets,
and then populates the user interface with these options.

5 CONCLUSION

A collection of portable web services, initially for multiple sequence
alignment, has been developed. It is designed to interact with
other software or services and be deployed easily on a variety
of computing infrastructures, either directly or through the use of

virtualization. JABAWS:MSA provides an in-house web services
solution that is limited only by locally available computing
resources. Furthermore, its client provides fault tolerance by
allowing access to multiple server instances, while the service
interface gives a high level of control over individual tasks.
Comprehensive metadata provided by each service enables their
integration with J alView, to allow novices and experts alike to
utilize their local compute resources efﬁciently. Finally, although
JABAWS:MSA is focused on multiple alignment, the JABAWS
framework is ﬂexible, and will soon be extended to include
analytical methods such as secondary structure and disorder
prediction.

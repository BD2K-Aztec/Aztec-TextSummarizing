Abstract

Purpose: The rcellminer R package provides a wide range of functionality to help R users access
and explore molecular profiling and drug response data for the NCl—60. The package enables flex—
ible programmatic access to CellMiner’s unparalleled breadth of NCl—60 data, including gene and
protein expression, copy number, whole exome mutations, as well as activity data for ~21K com—
pounds, with information on their structure, mechanism of action and repeat screens. Functions
are available to easily visualize compound structures, activity patterns and molecular feature pro—
files. Additionally, embedded R Shiny applications allow interactive data exploration.

Availability and implementation: rcellminer is compatible with R 3.2 and above on Windows, Mac
OS X and Linux. The package, documentation, tutorials and Shiny—based applications are available
through Bioconductor (http://VlANw.bioconductor.org/packages/rcellminer); ongoing updates will
occur according to the Bioconductor release schedule with new CellMiner data. The package is free
and open—source (LGPL 3).

1 Introduction

 

The NCI—60 cancer cell line panel has been used over the course of sev—
eral decades as an anti—cancer drug screen. This panel was developed
as part of the Developmental Therapeutics Program (DTP, http://dtp.
nci.nih.gov/) of the US. National Cancer Institute (NCI). Thousands
of compounds have been tested on the NCI—60, which have been fur—
ther characterized by numerous platforms for gene and protein expres—
sion, DNA copy number, whole exome mutation and others (Reinhold
et 61]., 2012). Furthermore, most NCI—60 cell lines are included in the
larger panels of the Broad Cancer Cell Line Encyclopedia (CCLE) and
the Sanger Cancer Genome Project (CGP) (Reinhold et 61]., 2014).

CellMiner (http://discover.nci.nih.gov/cellminer) integrates NCI—
60 compound activity and molecular profiling data derived from
multiple platforms. With its additional data relative to the NCI—DTP
site, stringent quality control and powerful online tools, CellMiner
is unmatched for exploration of NCI—60 data by biologists. Still,
there is currently no convenient programmatic interface to its wealth
of data for computational biologists seeking to develop specialized
analyses. Related projects, such as The Cancer Genome Atlas
(TCGA), provide such functionality through the Firehose and R
packages including RTCGAToolbox and MSKCC Cancer Genomics
Data Server (CGDSR) (Gao et 61]., 2013; Samur, 2014), and several

packages enable use of structural information (Cao et al., 2008;
Cuba, 2007; Wang et al., 2013). Here we present an R package pro—
viding convenient access to CellMiner data, with tools to facilitate
deeper exploration and use by researchers.

2 Implementation

This work exists as two packages: (i) rcellminer, a software R pack—
age that provides functionality and (ii) rcellminerData, a data pack—
age, which is a dependency of rcellminer. Within the rcellminer
package, numerous accessor functions are provided together with
Shiny—based user interfaces.

2.1 Available rcellminer data

The available data include mRNA expression, whole exome muta—
tion and DNA copy number. The data are retrieved directly from
the CellMiner project. We refer readers to Reinhold et al. and pack—
age documentation for information on the processing of the data; all
R scripts used for CellMiner data pre—processing are provided within
the package (Abaan et al., 2013; Reinhold et al., 2012, 2014).

2.2 Data representation

Data in rcellminerData are organized within two S4 class objects:
molData and drugData. These are instances of general—purpose
classes that are appropriate for R—based storage of pharmacoge—
nomic datasets involving multiple assay types. These two classes
build on existing base Bioconductor classes to give developers both
ﬂexibility and access to existing functionality. molData contains re—
sults for molecular assays (e.g. genomics, proteomics, etc.) that have
been performed on the NCI—60 and drugData contains results for
drug response assays. molData is an instance of the MolData S4
class that is composed of two slots: eSetList and sampleData,
eSetList is a list of eSet objects that can be of different dimensions;
this is conceptually similar to a single Bioconductor eSet object, but
differs in that there is no requirement for data matrices to have equal

dimensions. The second slot, sampleData, returns a data.frame con—
taining information for each sample. Drug activity (response) data is
provided in the rcellminerData package using the DrugData S4
class, which is composed of three slots: act, repeatAct and
sampleData. Both act (summary response data across multiple re—
peats) and repeatAct (individual repeat data) are eSet objects.
Additionally, rcellminerData provides a large amount of informa—
tion on drugs, including structure information, clinical testing sta—
tus, etc.

2.3 Accessing CellMiner data

In addition to providing access to the data within CellMiner, rcell-
miner provides basic descriptive statistics and plotting functionality
for both the molecular and drug response data. rcellminer also
makes available the structures of compounds screened against the
NCI—60 and allows users to create and compare structural finger—
prints between compounds. Tutorials in the form of a vignette with
several use cases related to recent CellMiner publications are pro-
vided. Many of these tasks can also be performed using embedded
interactive tools.

2.4 Interactive exploration of CellMiner data

While the main purpose of rcellminer is to provide a programmatic
interface to CellMiner data, interactive interfaces allow users to
quickly explore available data and develop insight for deeper ana—
lyses. To support this aim, rcellminer contains several interactive
tools that can be run by users locally. The ‘2D—Plot’ application,
shown in Figure 1, allows users to quickly assess relationships be—
tween any two features in the available data. Additionally, this ap—
plication allows any of the available features to be used as a pattern
for retrieving correlated features. The ‘Structure Comparison’ appli—
cation allows users to identify structurally similar compounds either
by using an NSC identifier or by providing a simplified molecular-
input line—entry system (SMILES) formatted chemical structure. The
‘Compound Information’ application allows visualization of

the NCI60. PAXX interacts with Ku to mediate DNA double-strand break repair, and bleomycin acts by inducing DNA double-strand breaks. High PAXX expres-
sion is associated with bleomycin resistance. In the application, point colors represent tissues of origin for the cell lines. Drug activity (act), and gene expression
(exp) are indicated as standardized (z—score) values, as described by (Reinhold et al., 2012)

3 Conclusion

The rcellminer R package is designed to allow R users to explore mo—
lecular profiling and drug response data on the NCI—60. rcellminer
complements the online CellMiner tools with ones that can be run lo—
cally to enhance access to the CellMiner data. We anticipate that these
tools will allow researchers to build powerful analyses of the NCI—60
data. We showcase some possibilities with the embedded R Shiny ap-
plications allowing quick exploration of the available data. We plan
to extend this R package to include additional compound data made
available by DTP, and other molecular profiling data for the NCI—60
from assays conducted by the Developmental Therapeutics Branch of
the NCI and other groups. With its extensive data and ﬂexible under—
lying functionality, rcellminer will make the NCI—60 accessible to a
larger segment of the community, enabling development of novel ana—
lyses. It additionally provides useful guidance for organizing data
from other cell line pharmacogenomic databases as R packages.

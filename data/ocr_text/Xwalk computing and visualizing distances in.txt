ABSTRACT

Motivation: Chemical cross-linking of proteins or protein complexes
and the mass spectrometry-based localization of the cross-linked
amino acids in peptide sequences is a powerful method for
generating distance restraints on the substrate’s topology.

Results: Here, we introduce the algorithm Xwalk for predicting and
validating these cross-links on existing protein structures. Xwalk
calculates and displays non-linear distances between chemically
cross-linked amino acids on protein surfaces, while mimicking the
flexibility and non-linearity of cross-linker molecules. It returns a
‘solvent accessible surface distance’, which corresponds to the
length of the shortest path between two amino acids, where the path
leads through solvent occupied space without penetrating the protein
surface.

Availability: Xwalk is freely available as a web server or stand-alone
JAVA application at http://www.xwalk.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

In computational structural biology, distance restraints from
chemical cross—linking experiments have so far been employed as an
upper limit on the Euclidean distance between a pair of cross—linked
amino acids (Kaimann et al., 2008; Shandiz et al., 2007). However,
deducing the ‘cross—linkability’ of an amino acid pair by measuring
the length of a Euclidean distance vector disregards the fact that
the vector often penetrates segments of the protein. Potluri et al.
(2004) have recognized this problem and implemented a short—cut
algorithm that computes the shortest path between two cross—linked
amino acids by using vertices from a protein surface triangulation
and convex hull, while Zelter et al. (2010) have explicitly modeled
the cross—linker molecule onto existing protein structures. We have
implemented Xwalk, which resembles the approach taken by Potluri
et al., but instead uses grids and a search algorithm to compute the
length of the shortest path (Fig. l), which shall be referred to as
solvent accessible surface distance (SASD). Our code is the only of
its kind being open source and available in form of a web server.

vector), which by value would have been in the cross—link range for DSS or
BS3. However, the shortest path with an SASD of 59.2A reveals that the
Euclidean distance vector actually penetrates the protein, leaving the only
option to connect both amino acids via a long detour over the protein surface
(chain of spheres colored blue to red for distances of 0—59 A, respectively).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Xwalk was written in the JAVA programming language. It is
based on the CleftXplorer modelling package (Kahraman et al.,
2010) and uses the breath—ﬁrst search algorithm on local grid
representations of the protein and its surrounding solvent to calculate
the shortest SASD path between two atoms of two amino acids
on the protein surface (Fig. l). Xwalk can run in two modes
(Supplementary Material), namely in validation mode in which
Xwalk veriﬁes experimentally measured cross—links on an existing
protein structure, or in production mode, in which Xwalk reports
a list of in silico predicted theoretically possible virtual cross—
links (vXL) that might be observed in a cross—linking experiment.
Both modes are identical except for step 1.0 in the Supplementary
Material, which in production mode is replaced by the speciﬁcation
of generic identiﬁers of amino acids to be cross—linked in silico.
Xwalk checks that the cross—linked amino acids and the entire
SASD path is solvent accessible. Furthermore, Xwalk takes the
dynamic disorder of protein segments within X—ray structures into
account. Therefore, it increases the maximum distance range of a
cross—linker spacer arm by the sum of the mean atomic displacement
of the cross—linked amino acids. The mean atomic displacement (x)
of a single amino acid is inferred from the Debye—Waller formula

328712 <x2>, where B is the atomic B factor of the cross—linked

amino acid as given in a PDB ﬁle. Moreover, Xwalk holds the option
to discard all side chains from the distance calculation to account
for their conformational change when reacting with the cross—linker
molecule. At the same time, the solvent accessible surface area is
expanded by increasing the solvent radius to 2.0A to avoid path
calculations through molecular ‘tunnels’ that arise due to the side
chain depletion.

The output of Xwalk is either a list of vXL or a PyMOL script
(http://www.pymol.org) displaying the shortest SASD path as a list
of dummy atom entries in a PDB ﬁle (Fig. 1). The list of vXL
is a list of atom pairs sorted by SASD with information on their
amino acid number and name, chain identiﬁer and atom name,
along with their distances in the PDB sequence, their Euclidean
distance and SASD. Furthermore, an in silica trypsin digestion can
be requested, in which case the associated shortest tryptic peptide
sequences are reported. The source code of Xwalk is available
under a Creative Commons license together with the executable
at http://www.xwalk.org. The same site provides also an easy to
use web interface to the basic functionalities of Xwalk with a Jmol
viewer applet (http://www.jmol.org) as a visualization tool for the
shortest paths.

3 CROSS-LINKING THE PDB

A cross—linking experiment can only yield cross—links if the proteins
under study have particular amino acids that are within a certain
distance from each other and solvent accessible. However, the
number of cellular proteins that have such characteristics is not
known neither is the number of cross—links one can expect per protein
or protein complex.

To estimate these numbers, we have run Xwalk in production
mode on a non—homologous protein dataset and simulated the most
common cross—linking reagents DSS and BS3 with both having
a maximum distance cut—off of 22.4A (11.42A N—N distance in
DSS —l—2 X 5A CB—NZ distance in lysine), discarding side chains
and measuring distances between C,B atoms. The protein dataset
consisted of 1621 X—ray protein structures from the PISA server
(Krissinel and Henrick, 2007), where protein homology was deﬁned
by the H—level or the superfamily—level in the CATH (Orengo et al.,
1997) or SCOP data base (Murzin et al., 1995), respectively. Each
protein in the dataset was selected to have the highest annotated
domain coverage and the highest number of protein chains within
its homology class, while setting an upper bound of 20 protein chains
for oligomeric protein complexes.

In the entire dataset, we calculated 30 266 unique vXL (excluding
vXL that are found between equivalent amino acids in homomers,
as these cannot be distinguished in real cross—linking experiments).
Of these, 25 751 were intra—protein and 4515 were inter—protein vXL.
The number of the unique intra— and inter—protein vXL increases
for one to ﬁve unique protein chains from 15 to 45 and 2 to 24,
respectively. In all, 18% of proteins had no vXL at all, while 40
protein structures had more than 100 vXL. The highest number
of unique vXL in the dataset, namely 271 vXL, was found in the
monomeric structure of the RNA—induced silencing complex (RISC)
associated argonaut protein (PDB—Id: 1u04, see Fig. 1b) and in
the bacteriophage DNA polymerase—DNA terminal protein complex
(PDB—Id: 2ex3).

The beneﬁt of Xwalk and SASD becomes apparent when the
above analysis is repeated with the conventional Euclidean distance.
The repetition with a 22.4A Euclidean distance cutoff resulted in
65 447 vXL, i.e. more than twice as many as with SASD. Of these,
35 181 vXL had a SASD larger than 22.4 A that differed on average
by >8 A. Of these, >100 vXL’s had a distance difference of >50 A
(see exemplary Fig. 1a). These numbers suggest that Xwalk is able
to reduce the false positive prediction of cross—links by >50%. The
large discrepancy emphasizes the importance of an adequate model
for a cross—linker molecule in cross—linking experiments.

Despite the smaller number of false positives with SASD, we
have observed that the number of vXL usually exceeds the number
of experimental cross—links by at least one order of magnitude
(Leitner et al., 2010). Most of the theoretically predicted but
experimentally unobserved cross—links may be missed because of
their low abundance, unfavorable chromatographic, ionization and
fragmentation properties or due to their unsuitable peptide length.
Another issue arises in cases in which segments of the protein
structure are missing, such as in intrinsically disordered proteins or
proteins with ﬂexible loops. These regions will have missing atom
coordinates that are currently ignored by Xwalk and may lead to
lower SASD than expected.

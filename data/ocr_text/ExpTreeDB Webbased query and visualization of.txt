ABSTRACT

Motivation: Numerous public microarray datasets are valuable
resources for the scientific communities. Several online tools have
made great steps to use these data by querying related datasets
with users’ own gene signatures or expression profiles. However,
dataset annotation and result exhibition still need to be improved.
Results: ExpTreeDB is a database that allows for queries on human
and mouse microarray experiments from Gene Expression Omnibus
with gene signatures or profiles. Compared with similar applications,
ExpTreeDB pays more attention to dataset annotations and result visu-
alization. We introduced a multiple-level annotation system to depict
and organize original experiments. For example, a tamoxifen-treated
cell line experiment is hierarchically annotated as ‘agent—>drug—>estro
gen receptor antagonist—>tamoxifen’. Consequently, retrieved results
are exhibited by an interactive tree-structured graphics, which provide
an overview for related experiments and might enlighten users on key
items of interest.

Availability and implementation: The database is freely available at
http://biotech.bmi.ac.cn/ExpTreeDB. Web site is implemented in Perl,
PHP, R, MySQL and Apache.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comparing gene expression proﬁles of cultured cells, tissues or
other samples at different states or time points is a common
strategy to search for key factors or underlying mechanisms in
biological and medical studies. Over the past decades, commer-
cial microarray platforms have been used for global gene expres-
sion proﬁling, and numerous proﬁling datasets have been
produced (Hoheisel, 2006). Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO),
the public repository collecting microarray datasets (Edgar et al.,
2002), has included 32 856 series datasets across 1591 organisms
produced by microarrays (January 24, 2014). These public

datasets are valuable resources for biological, medical and
pharmaceutical studies.

To use large numbers of public gene expression datasets, a
useful strategy is to connect datasets or experiments with similar
or opposite gene expression signatures. One important application
of this strategy is to predict novel drug repositioning candidates or
promising bioactive small molecules. The connectivity map
(cMap) project has generated a large number of gene expression
proﬁles of human tumor cell lines treated with over thousands of
bioactive small molecules and systematically discovered potential
connections among molecules, genes and diseases (Lamb, 2007;
Lamb et al., 2006). On using the datasets of the cMap project,
Iorio et al. found 41 047 connections among 1302 drugs based on
similarities of transcriptional responses following drug treat-
ments; several potentially ‘repositioned’ drugs were predicted
and veriﬁed, i.e. Topoisomerase inhibitors like SN—38 and
Doxorubicin were repositioned to functional inhibition of cyclin-
dependent kinase 2 (Iorio et al., 2010). Using similar strategy,
Butte and his colleagues investigated the connections of global
transcriptional responses between diseases and 164 small-mol-
ecule drug compounds; using rodent models, they predicted and
validated that topiramate, an anticonvulsant drug, might be ef-
fective in inﬂammatory bowel disease (IBD), and cimetidine, an
antiulcer drug, might be a previously undescribed therapeutic for
lung adenocarcinoma (Dudley et al., 2011; Sirota et al., 2011).

Several algorithms have been developed to quantitatively com-
pare expression proﬁles of global transcriptional responses
(Lamb et al., 2003; Plaisier et al., 2010; Subramanian et al.,
2005). Among these, gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA)
based on the Kolmogorov—Smirnov statistic (Hollander and
Wolfe, 1973) is a widely used method (Subramanian et al.,
2005, 2007). Instead of individual genes, GSEA focuses on
gene sets sharing biological functions or other information like
chromosomal location and regulation. Speciﬁcally, GSEA com-
pares a given gene set with a ranked gene list, and provides scores
and statistics to show how the gene set is enriched at extremes
(top or bottom) of the gene list.

Facilitated by these algorithms, various online tools and
resources have emerged. The cMap, as we described previously,
allows users to access and query with an algorithm later forma-
lized in GSEA. Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) 3.0
has included >6700 well-annotated gene sets from human and

other model organisms and supports keyword search and
GSEA-based enrichment analysis of the users’ own gene sets
(Liberzon et al., 2011; Subramanian et al., 2005). Unlike
MSigDB used for querying annotated gene sets, online applica-
tions such as Microarray Rank Query (MARQ) and Gene
Expression data Mining Toward Relevant Network Discovery
(GEM-TREND) allow users to discover experiments in GEO
that induce similar or opposite gene expression patterns
to their own experiments with GSEA approach (Feng et al.,
2009; Vazquez et al., 2010). Yi et a]. (2007) reported a bioinfor-
matics strategy named EXpression signature AnaLysis Tool
(EXALT) to encode and compare gene expression signatures.
Then, Wu et a]. (2009) developed an online version of EXALT
that includes >28 000 gene expression signatures derived from
GEO and allows keywords and signature search. Other Web
servers for analysis and annotation of GEO datasets like
GeneChaser and GEOGLE also support multiple gene search
(Chen et al., 2008; Yu et al., 2009). Besides these online applica-
tions, our group previously developed an R package named
GeneExpressionSignature (Li et al., 2013), which integrated the
GSEA algorithm and could be easily used in users’ own bioinfor-
matics analysis pipelines.

To search among a large number of gene expression datasets,
clear and comprehensive annotations of the original experiments
and vivid exhibitions of retrieved results are important. Current
tools usually display retrieved datasets in a long table list sorted
by similarity scores or signiﬁcance statistics. Although informa-
tion such as experimental design and samples used is given, the
results are not well organized and are difﬁcult to browse or ﬁnd
items of interest. Moreover, to provide a biologically meaningful
interpretation of retrieved results, selection of control groups and
their corresponding experimental groups is critical. In this article,
we present an online database ExpTreeDB, which includes
manually curated gene expression datasets derived from experi-
ments deposited in GEO. ExpTreeDB supports users’ query in
terms of either gene sets or global gene proﬁles based on a GSEA
approach. We manually selected control and experimental
groups for original GEO dataset records and implemented a
multiple-level annotation system for these datasets according to
original experimental treatments and description. In addition,
users’ query results are organized and visualized by interactive
tree-structured graphics. Users can conveniently collapse or
expand tree branches to focus on experiments of interest.
ExpTreeDB includes 1351 reference ranked gene lists represent-
ing various experimental treatments in human and mouse. The
database is available at http://biotech.bmi.ac.cn/ExpTreeDB.

2 METHODS

2.1 Gene expression proﬁling data collection

We downloaded global gene expression proﬁling datasets of Homo
sapiens and Mus musculus from GEO. We selected GEO datasets
(GDS) records produced by four platforms: Affymetrix mouse genome
430 2.0 array (GPL1261), Affymetrix mouse expression 430A array
(GPL339), Affymetrix human genome U133 plus 2.0 array (GPL570)
and Affymetrix human genome U133A array (GPL96). A total of 425
mouse and 511 human GDS records were obtained, which accounted for
43.69 and 44.86% of mouse and human GDS records (Mar 5, 2013),
respectively.

2.2 Generating reference ranked gene lists

Reference ranked gene lists (RRGLs) were derived from GDS records.
Every RRGL is composed of ranked upregulated and downregulated
genes that represent global transcriptional response induced by certain
experimental treatment or abnormal biological state. To generate
RRGLs, we ﬁrst identiﬁed control and experimental groups within
GDS records. For a clear deﬁnition of perturbations and a better inter-
pretation of transcriptional responses, we selected only GDS records with
‘blank’ control groups whose experimental subjects were at normal states
or without treatments, such as adjacent-tumor tissue or samples treated
with blank vehicle.

The workﬂow to collect information and ﬁlter GDS records is shown
in Figure 1. The keywords for determining a blank control group and the
GDS records excluded are provided in Supplementary Table S1 and S2,
respectively. For experimental groups, one or multiple perturbations may
be imposed on experimental subjects, such as agent treatment or gene
knockdown at disease state.

Next, blank control groups were matched to experimental groups
within the same GDS record. Every experimental group and its corres-
ponding control group were manually matched to generate a RRGL.
Home-made PERL scripts and R package GeneExpressionSignature
that we previously developed were used to produce RRGLs (Li et al.,
2013). In brief, for a given experimental—control group pair, we calculated
gene expression fold-change lists among all possible sample pairs. Then,
the fold-change lists derived from different pairs were merged by
Spearman’s Footrule (Diaconis and Graham, 1977) and Borda
Merging Method (Lin, 2010). The ﬁnal RRGL was a one-column
ranked gene list sorted by fold changes, representing cell response to a
speciﬁc experimental treatment under a certain condition. We compared
RRGLs produced by this method with a student’s t-test approach. We
found a median Pearson coefﬁcient correlation value of 0.88 and a mean
value of 0.84 (data not shown).

2.3 Multiple-level annotation of RRGLs

To annotate RRGLs, a four-level annotation system was manually im-
plemented based on original experimental information. Basically, the de-
tailed treatments on experimental subjects or disease states were deﬁned
as the last-level annotations, which were classiﬁed into ﬁve top-level

categories: ‘agent’, ‘stress’, ‘disease state’, ‘infection’ and ‘genotype
variation’.

We should address that although GDS records have a ‘subset_type’
item in the experimental description, these somehow seem arbitrary. For
example, ‘bacterial infection’ or ‘virus infection’ can be marked as ‘infec-
tion’, as well as ‘protocol’ and ‘agent’ in some cases (see GDS3298,
GDS3034 and GDS1478); ‘cigarette smoking’ or ‘smoke’ is classiﬁed as
both ‘stress’ and ‘agent’ (see GDS3709, GDS2990). In ExpTreeDB, we
manually ensured uniqueness of experimental annotations. Additionally,
‘protocol’ subset type of human GDS records actually contains various
experiment types. In ExpTreeDB, we replaced ‘protocol’ with clearer
experiment annotations like ‘genotype variation’, ‘infection’ or ‘stress’
(see GDS3578, GDS3034 and GDS906).

The principles to add the second-level and third-level annotations
within the ﬁve top categories are depicted below.

(1) Disease state. We referred to the World Health Organization
International Classiﬁcation of Diseases, 10th version (ICD-lO).
From the disease state description of GDS records or related lit-
erature, second-level annotations were deﬁned as the ICD-lO chap-
ters and third-level annotations as classiﬁcation domain nearest to
fourth-level annotation. For example, samples from individuals
harboring papillary thyroid carcinoma were marked with ‘disease
state—>Neoplasms—>Thyroid and other endocrine glands—>papil—
lary thyroid carcinoma’, where ‘Neoplasms’ is the top classiﬁcation
domain (ICD-lO chapter) covering ‘papillary thyroid carcinoma’,
and ‘Thyroid and other endocrine glands’ is the lowest classiﬁca-
tion domain describing ‘papillary thyroid carcinoma’. For most
RRGLs under ‘disease state’, we obtained their corresponding
items of ICD-lO, and the unclassiﬁed were labeled as ‘other’.

(2) Agent. If an agent could be referred to anatomical therapeutic
chemical (ATC) classiﬁcation systems, the corresponding RRGLs
were labeled with ‘drug’ at second-level annotations. Otherwise,
according to the agent types, the second-level annotations could
be ‘small molecule’, ‘protein’, ‘lipid’, ‘diet’, ‘chemical’ or ‘other’.
The third-level annotations were manually curated to represent the
function or subtypes of agents, like ‘inﬂammation mediator’ and
‘cytokine’. For example, a RRGL of the effect of letrozole on
breast cancer tumors could be annotated as ‘agent—> drug—>anti-
estrogen agent—>letrozole’.

(3) Genotype variation. The last-level annotation was the object gene
name. The second-level annotation indicated that the gene was
protein coding or microRNAs. The third-level annotation recorded
the experiment protocol or gene expression status, such as ‘knock-
out’, ‘knockin’, ‘transfection’, ‘overexpression’ or ‘induction’.

(4) Infection. Annotations were based on microorganisms. The
second-level annotations of ‘infection’ RRGLs were microorgan-
ism domains: ‘bacteria’, ‘virus’, ‘fungi’ or ‘protozoan’. The third-
level annotations were based on disease symptom or effect induced
by pathogens and/or pathogen types. For example, RRGLs of
Aeromonas caviae infection were annotated as ‘gram-negative,
gastroenteritis-associated pathogen’ at third-level.

(5) Stress. We classiﬁed ‘stress’ into three categories, with ‘physical’,
‘psychological’ or ‘other’ as second-level annotations. Radiation,
hypoxia and mechanical damage were typical third-level annota-
tions of physical stress. We also classiﬁed cigarette smoking and
exposure to pollutants into physical stress. Patient caregiver
chronic stress was the only psychological stress annotation.
Similar to ‘infection’, the third-level annotation depicted stress
effect or subtype of stress, like ‘respiratory tract-harmful stimulus’
and ‘ionizing radiation’. A RRGL describing the chronic stress of
patient caregiver could be labeled as ‘stress—>psychological—>pa—
tient caregiver-associated»chronic stress’.

The annotation of RRGLs allowed for multiple perturbations at all
the four levels, such as a cell line under both genotype variation and agent
treatment. For the four-level annotation of RRGLs, we only considered
perturbations that might induce transcriptional responses. Other experi-
mental information, such as tissue types, time points, individual gender,
drug ATC codes and gene ofﬁcial symbols, would be provided as an
additional ﬁeld of RRGL annotations.

2.4 Querying related RRGLs (algorithm and parameters)

In case users upload raw gene expression proﬁling data, ExpTreeDB ﬁrst
obtains a gene signature from the uploaded data, and then performs
query with the signature. Speciﬁcally, a RRGL is ﬁrst generated from
the user’s dataset, and ExpTreeDB extracts the top and bottom of RRGL
as gene signature. We scanned the size of signatures, and found that a
threshold of 500 up- or downregulated genes is suitable (Supplementary
Material and Supplementary Fig. S1).

The R package GeneExpressionSignature, which integrates GSEA (Li
et al., 2013; Subramanian et al., 2005), is implemented to compare user’s
signature with RRGLs within ExpTreeDB. Enrichment scores for both
upregulated genes (ESup) and downregulated genes (ESdown) are obtained,
and similarity is deﬁned as (ESup—ESdown)/2. On condition that user up-
loads signature containing only upregulated genes or downregulated
genes, similarity is either ESup or ESdown.

ExpTreeDB will return the top 5% RRGLs ranked by enrichment
scores on the condition that their P—values are <0.05. To derive
P—values, ExpTreeDB calculates similarities between the users’ queries
with 10000 pre-generated random RRGLs, denoted by {5,}. Given S,
as the similarity value between user’s query and a native RRGL, and n as
the rank number of S, in {5,}, P—value is deﬁned as n/ 10 001.

2.5 Tree-structured visualization of related RRGLs

Based on the hierarchical annotations of gene expression experiment,
ExpTreeDB generates an interactive tree visualization of related
RRGLs. A JavaScript tool named dTree (dTree Version 2.05) is imple-
mented to draw the tree. The root of the tree stands for the user’s query.
The ﬁve top-level branches of tree are ‘disease state’, ‘agent’, ‘genotype
variation’, ‘infection’ and ‘stress’, and sub-level branches and leaves are
the sub-level annotations and the related RRGLs, respectively. Tree
branches can be interactively collapsed and expanded. A table recording
more detailed information of related RRGLs is exhibited below the tree,
including the original GDS record number, the similarity score and rank,
P—values and other experiment information.

2.6 Clustering and visualization of related RRGLs

To exhibit connections among returned related RRGLs, ExpTreeDB
visualizes how the RRGLs are clustered by their differences. In details,
pair-wise distances of all RRGLs of human or mouse was pre-generated.
We used the MATLAB version of afﬁnity propagation clustering algo-
rithm proposed by Frey et a]. (Frey and Dueck, 2007) to cluster RRGLs
by distances. On the result Web page, ExpTreeDB presents only a
network of related RRGLs in clusters, and the edges within the clusters
are visible if the two RRGLs are top 5% similar among all possible
human or mouse RRGL pairs.

2.7 Gene ontology analysis

For RRGLs within ‘genotype variation—>coding gene’ category, we
obtained the fourth-level annotations and manually transferred them
into ofﬁcial gene symbols provided by the HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee. The human and mouse gene symbol lists were uploaded to
the Protein ANalysis THrough Evolutionary Relationships) classiﬁcation
system for Gene Ontology (GO) functional classiﬁcation (Thomas et al.,
2003).

3 RESULTS

3.1 ExpTreeDB overview

ExpTreeDB consists of four parts: a submission page, a RRGL
repository, a GSEA-centered calculation module and a result
exhibition page (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. S2). The
RRGL repository is the base of ExpTreeDB. With blank control
groups as baselines, RRGLs represent cell global transcriptional
responses for various perturbations like treatments or abnormal
states. These RRGLs are manually curated and hierarchically
organized. Currently, ExpTreeDB contains 906 and 445
RRGLs in human and mouse, respectively.

A GSEA-centered calculation pipeline is used in ExpTreeDB,
and users can query RRGL database to ﬁnd similar gene expres-
sion signatures produced by certain experiments. ExpTreeDB
enables queries from users by handling differentially expressed
gene sets (gene signatures) or global gene expression proﬁles with
assigned control and experimental groups. Based on the mul-
tiple-level annotations of RRGLs, ExpTreeDB will export
related RRGLs to an interactive tree-structured graphic followed
by a table containing detailed information. The matching details
of query and a given related RRGL can be accessible in a new
Web page. Furthermore, a network generated by clustering of
related RRGLs is also displayed, exhibiting underlying connec-
tions among these RRGLs.

3.2 RRGL annotations and statistics

We implemented a hierarchical four-level annotation system on
these RRGLs. For instance, an experiment consisting of a cell line
treated with the drug tamoxifen would be annotated as
‘agent—>drug—>estrogen receptor antagonist—>tamoxifen’.
Other experimental information like cell lines, time points, subject
information, is also provided if any. The fourth-level annotations
depict the speciﬁc perturbations inducing transcriptional re-
sponses, and the second- and third-level annotations were manu-
ally added based on the characteristics of each experiment type
(see Methods). In sum, through the multiple-level annotation
system, these RRGLs can be both well-organized and annotated.

The four-level annotations and their statistics of human and
mouse RRGLs are illustrated in Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S3, and the complete annotations can be downloaded
on ExpTreeDB Web site (Letunic and Bork, 2007, 2011).
Because the mouse is an important model animal, more than

half of the mouse RRGLs (227, 59.5%) belong to the ‘genotype
variation’ category. In human, only 9.7% of RRGLs (88
RRGLs) belong to that category. A total of 43 human and
140 mouse unique protein-coding genes are involved within
these RRGLs. Functional classiﬁcation based on GO shows
that these human and mouse genes have similar distributions
of GO term assignments (Fig. 4). Unlike the relatively high
frequency of protein-coding genes, only ﬁve microRNAs are
involved in human RRGLs (miR-34, miR-I55, miR-I24, WR-
335 and miR-KI2—II) and 2 microRNAs in mouse (miRNA-I-2
and miR-290) RRGLs.

The largest top-level category for human RRGLs is ‘disease
state’ (270, 29.8%). For the second-level annotations, ‘neoplasm’
accounts for nearly half of these RRGLs (129, 47.8%), corres-
ponding to 24 neoplasm types (Supplementary Table S3).
‘Disease of the digestive system’ and ‘Diseases for the nervous
system’ are tied for the second place (8.1% of human ‘disease
state’ RRGLs). On the other hand, we are interested in the vari-
ous biological specimens used in these human disease studies and
referred to the original 87 GDS records. We found that 56 GDS
records involved human tissues as experimental subjects, and 20
GDS records used blood or bone marrow cells. Cultured cells
were also used in 11 GDS records, such as lymphoblastoid cell
lines derived from individuals (GDS2779) and pulmonary artery
endothelial cells to study response to sickle cell plasma
(GDS1257).

‘Agent’ was a major category for both human (446, 49.2%)
and mouse (125, 28.1%) RRGLs, and exhibits great diversity,
including drugs, small molecules, proteins/peptides, chemicals,
biomaterials and others. RRGLs marked with ‘drug’ were of
special interest for drug reposition research. A total of 33
human and 16 mouse GDS records involved 25 and 19 drugs,
respectively. These drugs were correlated to 59 ATC codes, and
14 ATC codes were in common for human and mouse. ‘Stress’
and ‘Infection’ categories account for a small proportion of the
whole RRGL repository. Nonetheless, some interesting and im-
portant perturbations like cigarette smoking, hypoxia and HIV
infection belong to these two categories.

identiﬁer is ﬂexible (Entrez Gene ID, Ensembl ID, Genbank
accession number, gene symbol and Affymetrix Probe ID).
Upregulated genes and/or downregulated genes should be
uploaded with a constrained range of gene numbers (10~500

for Affymetrix Probe ID, and 5~300 for other gene identiﬁers)
when users submit their signatures. Alternatively, users
can directly upload gene expression proﬁles. The control and
experimental group for these proﬁles have to be deﬁned
for ExpTreeDB to generate a gene signature for further calcula-
tions. ExpTreeDB supports datasets produced by a number
of Affymetrix platforms or next-generation sequencing technol-
ogy (Supplementary Table S4). A plain tab-separated gene
expression value matrix with column names as sample identiﬁers
and row names as gene identiﬁers is also allowed, which
can be easily transformed from other gene expression proﬁle
formats.

ExpTreeDB converts all other gene identiﬁers into Affymetrix
Probe IDs for following calculation. The GSEA-centered pipe-
line is used to calculate pair-wise enrichment scores and statis-
tical signiﬁcance between the user’s dataset and RRGLs within
ExpTreeDB. RRGLs with enrichment scores ranking top 5%
and P—values <0.05 would be retrieved for output.

The result page is mainly composed of three parts: an inter-
active tree structure of annotations of related RRGLs, a table of
detailed RRGL information and a clustering network of related
RRGLs (Supplementary Fig. S2). The tree is constructed based
on the multiple-level annotation system of RRGLs, with branch
nodes as sub-category annotations and leaves as RRGL items
held in the database (see example in Fig. 5). From the tree, users
can obtain a global view and classiﬁcations of how their sub-
mitted data connected with previous reported experiments. To
focus on their topic of interest, users can expand and collapse
tree nodes at any level, or choose to display a particular part of
the tree. For example, to mine potential drug repositions, user
can expand the ‘agent—>drug’ node on the tree, and collapse the

others. The effect of retrieved drugs and drug names will be
displayed under the ‘agent—>drug’ node.

To obtain the detailed information of retrieved RRGLs,
RRGL accession numbers on the tree are linked to correspond-
ing rows of the table below the tree. The table contains original
experiment description, GDS record accession numbers with
hyperlinks to GEO Web site, GSEA-centered calculation results
(rank, enrichment score, P—value), four-level annotations and
other supporting information like cell line, drug ATC code or
time points. We also provide a page to illustrate the matching
details between query and a given related-RRGL. The positions
of query genes within the RRGL are visualized by a colored bar,
and gene details such as GO terms are presented in a table (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). To determine connections among these
RRGLs, ExpTreeDB pre—generated a network by clustering en-
richment score matrix of all RRGL pairs. The connections
among retrieved RRGLs will be displayed. The output page
could be retrieved by a task identiﬁer within three months.

3.4 Sample case: to mine for perturbations similar to
hypoxia

We downloaded gene expression datasets of human renal prox-
imal tubule epithelial cells subjected to hypoxia (GDS3524,
GSEl2792) (Beyer et al., 2008). To mine perturbations inducing
transcriptional responses similar to hypoxia, we submitted the
SOFT format datasets (GSEl2792_family.soft.gz) to
ExpTreeDB. Samples 4, 5 and 6 within the proﬁle series were

Fig. 5. The tree-structured visualization of related RRGLs for hypoxia-
induced cell responses. For space limits, the tree branches of ‘agent’,
‘disease state’ and ‘stress’ are, respectively, shown. The full tree can be
accessed through task identiﬁer 463

assigned as the experimental group and samples 1, 2 and 3 as
control group, allowing comparison of the cell response under
hypoxic condition (at 1% oxygen for 24 h) with those under
normal oxygen content. The calculation process took 43 s, and
results could be accessed with task identiﬁer 463. A total of 46
related RRGLs were returned.

From the annotation tree of the returned RRGLs, we ob-
tained an overview of related experiment types and speciﬁc treat-
ments (Fig. 5). These RRGLs were classiﬁed into three top-level
categories: ‘stress’, ‘disease state’ and ‘agent’. The subclassiﬁca—
tions within ‘stress’ and ‘disease state’ were simple. Besides the
hypoxia’s effect on various cell lines, cigarette smoking, endo-
metriosis and renal cell carcinoma (RCC) at different stages were
three perturbation types that induced cell responses similar to the
query. Cigarette smoking is known to decrease tissue or blood
ﬂow oxygen (Fan et al., 2012; Hoff et al., 2012; Jensen et al.,
1991; Sorensen et al., 2009). The query results implied that the
state of the non-diseased lung tissues from both ‘smoker’ and
‘former smoker’ is related to hypoxia, with ‘smoker’ at a higher
rank. A major feature for solid tumors is hypoxia (Brahimi-Horn
et al., 2007; Brown and Wilson, 2004; Semenza, 2007; Vaupel
and Mayer, 2007), and RCC has been reported to overexpress
hypoxia-inducible factor-la (HIF—Ia) when compared with
benign tissue (Klatte et al., 2007). However, no RRGLs corres-
ponding to other solid tumor besides RCC were returned. As
most RCC RRGLs ranked at the bottom of the 46 RRGLs,
other solid tumor RRGLs might be ﬁltered by enrichment
score rank or signiﬁcance threshold. The connection of endomet-
riosis with hypoxia was interesting. A study in mice suggested
that hypoxia appears to be important for endometriosis and re-
sults in upregulation of HIF—Ia (Becker et al., 2008).

Moreover, the RRGLs in the ‘agent’ category exhibited great
diversity in terms of agent types. From the annotation tree, we
found three types of drugs, two types of small molecules, cyto-
kine, carcinogen (nickel chloride) and biomaterial. At the fourth-
level annotations, RRGLs annotated as ‘dimethyloxalylglycine’
and ‘collagen/chondroitin tissue engineering scaffold mesh’ were
top-ranked among the retrieved RRGLs. The literature asso-
ciated with these also reported that these two types of agents
induced gene expression patterns like hypoxia (Elvidge et al.,
2006; Klapperich and Bertozzi, 2004). The validation of the re-
lationship between hypoxia and other agent treatments, such as
the growth inhibitor imatinib and a small molecule that induces
differentiation, might need further investigation.

Another ﬁve case studies are included in Supplementary
Material, which are provided to exhibit reliability of
ExpTreeDB outputs and advantage of the multiple-annotation
system in user experience.

4 DISCUSSION

Currently, many other online applications querying gene signa-
ture databases have been developed, such as MSigDB, MARQ,
GEM-TREND, EXALT and GeneChaser (Chen et al., 2008;
Feng et al., 2009; Liberzon et al., 2011; Vazquez et al., 2010;
Wu et al., 2009), and provide users with great convenience. A
tendency of these types of applications is to cover more and more
datasets (Liberzon et al., 2011), and algorithms to quantify

expression proﬁle or signature similarities have also been greatly
emphasized.

ExpTreeDB resembles these tools in many aspects such as data
sources and enrichment score calculation algorithm. Vazquez
et al. comprehensively summarized and compared the features
of various online applications, which could be referred in
(Vazquez et al., 2010). Compared with these applications,
ExpTreeDB exhibits a disadvantage in organism coverage
(human and mouse) and data content (906 human and 445
mouse RRGLs). However, previous studies did not provide a
well-depicted standard for control group or reference dataset
selection, which might make it difﬁcult to interpret the perturb-
ation inducing the cell response (see example in Supplementary
Material). Raw gene expression proﬁles are also supported by
ExpTreeDB, and the threshold of 500 most upregulated and
downregulated genes was chosen to generate signatures from
these data. Though this threshold might not be suitable for data-
sets with very few differentially expressed genes, it could be
applied to other datasets in most cases. Moreover, previous ap-
plications generally exported retrieved results in a table list sorted
by relevance with users’ query, which might be inconvenient for
browsing or ﬁnding items of interest. MSigDB classiﬁed gene
sets into seven major collections and several sub-collections ac-
cording to genes’ derivation, including gene locations in chromo-
somes, pathway genes and motif genes, which is an approach
essentially different from the experiment-based classiﬁcation in
ExpTreeDB.

In ExpTreeDB, GDS records were manually examined to
generate RRGLs. Datasets without blank control group were
excluded. The stringent requirement for control groups re-
markably decreased GDS records included in ExpTreeDB,
but ensured a clear biological interpretation of perturbations
inducing cell transcriptional responses. On top of that, we im-
plemented a multiple-level annotation system for original ex-
periments, which greatly differed from other similar online
applications. The annotations brieﬂy and comprehensively de-
picted experiment classiﬁcations and designs. By this ap-
proach, data within ExpTreeDB were well organized, and
query results could be vividly visualized by an interactive and
informative tree structure. Therefore, the multiple-level anno-
tation system could greatly improve users’ experience in result
interpretation.

In all, ExpTreeDB is an online database for querying gene
expression datasets of human and mouse derived from GEO.
Users can upload global gene proﬁling data or gene signatures
to mine related previously reported experiments. ExpTreeDB in-
tegrates a widely used algorithm and public gene expression
datasets, but characterizes itself by manually annotated experi-
ments and tree visualization of retrieved results. We also have a
plan to update the database repository by including GEO series
records in the next version of ExpTreeDB.

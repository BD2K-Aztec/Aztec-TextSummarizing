Animal models serve an important purpose in fundamental re-
search aimed at understanding the molecular networks under-
pinning biological and cellular mechanisms. In drug
development and toxicological risk assessment, compound test-
ing usually starts by in vitro experiments, followed by in vivo
testing using rodents as a mammalian model. This practice as-
sumes that such animal models respond to active substances
through similar mechanisms. Yet in spite of many effective
uses of animal models, numerous ﬁndings have also been unsuc-
cessfully translated to humans, as evidenced by the failure of
many clinical trials. These failures clearly stem from our lack
of detailed understanding of inter-species differences that pre-
cludes naive translation of knowledge derived from animal
models directly to human, but also further distinction among
available rodent models, including xenograft, genetic or syngen-
eic models. Such limitations are driving the development of
increasingly more complex in vitro systems, ranging from 3D-
organoid tissue cultures derived from primary cells to so-called
human Organs-on—chips (Huh et al., 2013) and Human-
on-a-chip (Marx et al., 2012). However, it is still early days,
and replacing complex model organisms with a battery of
in vitro systems that adequately recapitulates human biology is
a journey that has just begun.

In this context, a pertinent question to ask is ‘to what extent
perturbations induced in rodent cells are conserved and hence
predictable, in human cells?’

This important question was addressed in the form of a chal-
lenge titled ‘Species Translation Challenge’ in the framework of
sbv IMPROVER (systems biology veriﬁcation, Industrial
Methodology for PROcess VEriﬁcation in Research) (Meyer
et al., 2012), a collaborative initiative by IBM Research and
Philip Morris International (PMI) R&D that uses crowd-sour-
cing approaches to address fundamental questions in systems
biology. For 4 months, starting in May 2013, the Species
Translation Challenge was articulated around four sub-
challenges focusing on different aspects of translatability within
and between species. The results of this challenge provide insights

on (i) the accuracy of predictions in the context of the diversity
and dimensionality of data types generated at various levels of
the biological system; (ii) the importance of temporal informa-
tion (more time points) to gain resolution in sequential molecular
events, especially if the activation time window is shifted between
species; (iii) heterogeneity of results from similar computational
methods, which is probably due to different methodological
choices made at distinct steps of the process (e.g. data prepro-
cessing, feature selection, classiﬁcation algorithm) that are prob-
lem dependent; (iV) a consensus network that describes the
conservation and divergence of biological pathways and inter-
actions in response to a subset of stimuli. A total of 28 teams,
comprising 51 scientists from 14 countries across Europe, North
America, Asia and Australia submitted predictions. The submis-
sions of each team were evaluated by an independent panel of
scientists and the results of the Species Translation Challenge
were presented, and best performers were rewarded at the sbv
IMPROVER Symposium last October 2013 in Athens, Greece.
Three best-performing teams were recognized in the ﬁrst sub-
Challenge. Team AMG involved scientists from University of
California Santa Barbara (USA), University of Groningen
(Netherlands) and Rutgers University (USA). The other best
performers in this sub-Challenge were Clemson University
(USA) and Wayne State University (USA). Team AMG was
also best performing in sub-Challenges 2 and 3. Five teams
were recognized as joint best performers in sub-Challenge 4:
one from Max Planck Institute for Dynamics of Complex
Technical Systems (Germany), a Swiss team from University of
Lausanne and Institute of Bioinformatics, one from Paciﬁc
Northwest National Laboratory (USA) and two separate
teams from University of Pittsburgh (USA). Details of each
team are published on the sbv IMPROVER website (http://
www.sbvimprover.com).

This issue of Bioinformatics contains six articles dedicated
to the overall results, and the detailed description of best-
performing computational methods that arose from the Species
Translation Challenge.

The current work constitutes a proof of principle that
the molecular responses induced by active substances in an
in vitro system are to some extent predictive of the responses
observed in the same system of another species. A more detailed
understanding of the range of applicability of the translation con-
cept will impact the predictability of signaling responses, mode of
action and efﬁcacy of drugs in the ﬁeld of systems pharmacology

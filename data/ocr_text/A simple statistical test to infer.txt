ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cell-based phenotypic screens using small molecule
inhibitors is an important technology for early drug discovery if
the relationship between the disease-related cellular phenotype
and inhibitors’ biological targets can be determined. However,
chemical inhibitors are rightfully believed to be less specific than
perturbation by biological agents, such as antibody and small
inference RNA. Therefore, it is often a challenge in small molecule
phenotypic screening to infer the causality between a particular
cellular phenotype and the inactivation of the responsible protein
due to the off-target effect of the inhibitors.

Results: In this article, we present a Roche in-house effort of
screening 746 structurally diverse compounds for their cytotoxicity
in HeLa cells measured by high content imaging technology. These
compounds were also systematically profiled for the targeted and
off-target binding affinity to a panel of 25 pre-selected protein
kinases in a cell-free system. In an effort to search for the kinases
whose activities are crucial for cell survival, we found that the
simple association method such as the chi-square test yields a large
number of false positives because the observed cytotoxic phenotype
is likely to be the result of promiscuous action of less specific
inhibitors instead of true consequence of inactivation of single
relevant target. We demonstrated that a stratified categorical data
analysis technique such as the Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel test is an
effective approach to extract the meaningful biological connection
from the spurious correlation resulted from confounding covariates.
This study indicates that, empowered by appropriate statistical
adjustment, small molecule inhibitor perturbation remains a powerful
tool to pin down the relevant biomarker for drug safety and efficacy
research.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past, drug discovery heavily relied upon cell—based
phenotypic screening in which the drug candidates that induce the

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

desired cellular phenotype are discovered ﬁrst and the molecular
mechanism of action (MMOA) is identiﬁed later (Hart, 2005).
The completion of the human genome project and the emergence
of ‘omic’ type technologies such as RNA microarrays greatly
increase the expectation of disease ‘target’ oriented drug discovery.
However, the productivity of the pharmaceutical industry keeps
declining despite all these technological innovations. As a result, we
have recently seen phenotypic screening regain the momentum in
delivering promising drug candidates. The challenge, however, lies
on the elucidation of molecular mechanism by which the candidate
compounds elicit the cellular phenotype of interest, which is always
important for understanding disease and medicine and serve as
the basis for the further pre—clinical development (Swinney and
Anthony, 2011).

In recent years, pharmaceutical industries have keen interest in
developing therapeutic small molecules targeting protein kinases,
a gene family implicated in cancer and inﬂammation. However,
it is proven difﬁcult to determine the crucial targets responsible
for pathological phenotype in a protein kinase—focused phenotypic
screen due to the off—target behaviors of small molecules. Many
kinase inhibitors demonstrate broad cross—reactivity to the family
of protein kinases which share a conserved ATP binding pocket
prone to competitive interaction (Correll et al., 2006). In this
study, we described the proﬁling of 746 structurally diverse
compounds for their in vitro kinase inhibiting properties and
cytotoxicity, a cellular phenotype regarded as a typical surrogate
for early safety and efﬁcacy assessment. We devised a three—step
statistical framework to facilitate the identiﬁcation of protein
kinases whose inactivation is responsible for compound—induced
cytotoxicity. General association methods that correlate blockage
of kinases with cytotoxicity such as the chi—square test was ﬁrst
performed to generate a potential target list. Then a logistic
regression model is conducted to conﬁrm the suspected covariate
that confounds with the inhibitors’ targeted effect, therefore, may
interfere with causal inference. Finally, a stratiﬁed categorical
analysis such as the Cochran—Mantel—Haenszel (CMH) test is
conducted across the entire level of confounding covariates to
identify the causal target whose signiﬁcance is independent of
an inhibitor’s cross—reactivity. We are also able to use literature
knowledge and experimental data to validate the resulting targets
unveiled by the CMH test. This study demonstrates the necessity
for a rigorous statistical correction in order to make accurate
inference from data sources inﬂuenced by latent confounding

factors, such as a phenotypic screen querying small molecule
compounds.

2 EXPERIMENTS AND DATA ANALYSIS

See Supplementary Materials for detailed description of
experiments. The Chi—square test, ﬁsher exact test, Cochran—
Mantel—Haenszel test and the logistic regression are conducted with
SAS 9.1.3 (SAS institute, 2002).

3 METHODS AND RESULTS

3.1 Selection of kinases and compounds

Due to the prohibitive cost of exhaustively proﬁling all the kinases in human
genome, we decided to build a small protein kinase panel that represents the
Human Kinome by maximizing sequence diversity. Diversity is measured
by pairwise distance measurement of the kinase catalytic domain sequences.
Pairwise distance matrix (p—distance) was generated using MEGA 3 (Kumar
et a1. 2004). The kinase with the highest number of neighbors (deﬁned as
p—distance <0.6) was selected. This kinase and its neighbors were then re—
moved from the distance matrix, which was then scanned again for the next
kinase with the highest number of neighbors. The above steps were repeated
until all kinases were removed from the matrix. The top 30 kinases and their
closest neighbors were considered for prioritization by other factors (e.g.
availability of enzyme/peptide substrate for setting up the kinase assay and
structural diversity of the ATP—binding site). Twenty kinases were selected
in this iterative process. Five additional ones were added subsequently from
kinase therapeutic projects.

746 compounds were selected for in vitro kinase binding and cytotoxicity
proﬁling based on in—house availability, structural diversity and their known
kinase binding properties. The pIC50 values of this compounds library
for the 25 protein kinases were merged with the maximum cytotoxicity
index within the dose range for each compound and visualized in a heat
map shown in supplementary ﬁgure 1. We also showed that the 25—kinase
panel well represents the diversity of the complete human kinome as
the relative level of inhibitor cross—reactivity measured from this small
panel is in good concordance with that measured by the more complete
Ambit kinase panel (Supplementary Fig. S2). The cytotoxicity index is
deﬁned from multiple cytotoxicity parameters by the automated algorithm
provided by vendor of high—content screening technology (Hoffman and
Garippa, 2007).

3.2 Identiﬁcation of the association between the
inactivation of individual kinase and cytotoxicity
by two-way contingency table

We summarize the evolution of our analysis strategy in a ﬂowchart as
shown in Supplementary Figure S3. The activity data of in vitro kinase
inhibition is often truncated for the less potent compounds that typically
do not have numerical IC50 values. In order to make use of this censored
information, we propose to apply categorical data analysis methodologies to
this dataset instead of linear correlation of continuous variables. Speciﬁcally,
the kinase inhibitors are coded as ‘inhibitory’ or ‘non—inhibitory’ and ‘toxic’
or ‘non—toxic’ according to the pre—deﬁned cutoff value for their IC50 in
kinase inhibition assay and cytotoxicity index, respectively. Here we ﬁrst
chose IC50 = 1 MM as threshold for a potent inhibition, which is primarily
based on the distribution of binding afﬁnity and the fact that maximum
cytotoxicity index of compounds are primarily induced at 10 MM, the highest
dose of titration series. We use cytotoxicity index = 50% as the cutoff
that sets apart the toxic and non—toxic compounds because cells above
this value demonstrate typical cytotoxic phenotype with high conﬁdence.
Given this type of dichotomization, the status of kinase inhibition can be

formulated in a series of two—way contingency tables with cytotoxicity status
as follows:

 

 

Kinase k Non—toxic Toxic Row
Non—inhibitory nOOk nolk nok
Inhibitory n10k "1 1k "1 .k
Column n.0k n.1k n..k

 

It is well known that the test statistics follow the chi—square distribution
under null hypothesis that an inhibitor of kinase k does not have elevated
risk to induce cell death compared with non—inhibitors.

(i'_Ai')2 . -
xi=22%(z=0,1,1=0,1)
l J

 Xl’l/J-k

 

where [Lijk = k is the expected frequency under the null—hypothesis
(Agresti, 2002). If the observed proportion of toxic inhibitors signiﬁcantly
exceeds the expected value under null hypothesis then the it can be concluded
that inactivation of kinase k is strongly associated with cytotoxic phenotype
therefore the function of kinase kis likely to be crucial to the homeostasis
of the cell. Table 1 lists 14 protein kinases with signiﬁcant P—value from
the chi—square test (Column 2) that could be considered as candidate for
house—keeping protein kinases in HeLa cells.

3.3 Inhibitor promiscuity is a confounding variable
that inﬂuences the inference on kinase/cytotoxicity
association

We use logistic regression model to show that the promiscuity of inhibitors
is another signiﬁcant contributing factor to cytotoxicity. The rationale, result
and interpretation of our logistic model are provided in Supplementary Table
81). Moreover, the boxplot in Figure lb shows that the inhibitors of each
kinase have very different median promiscuity measured by the number
of targets they bind to. Speciﬁcally, Figure lc showed the heat map of
binding proﬁles for several toxic potent inhibitors of c—Src and KDR, both
of which are identiﬁed as crucial kinases for cell homeostasis by the chi—
square test. Potent c—Src inhibitors also block the activity of KDR and
PDGFR with lesser but still strong afﬁnity while KDR inhibitors show
signiﬁcant cross—reactivity to c—Src, PDGFR and ABL. The inﬂuence of
inhibitor cross—reactivity as possible confounding factor on the association
study between kinase and cytotoxicity is demonstrated in Figure la. Thus, the
observed linkage between the blockage of a speciﬁc kinase and cytotoxicity
could possibly be caused by the cross—reactivity of inhibitors instead of
indispensability of individual kinase target.

3.4 Use CMH test to account for bias introduced by
inhibitor promiscuity

As shown in Figure la, the observed cytotoxicity could either be induced
by the loss of activity of single important kinase or blockage of multiple
pathways by non—speciﬁc inhibitors or the combination of both. To extract
the causality of cytotoxicity by inactivation of individual target from
confounding covariate(s) (cross—reactivity), we introduce the CMH test. The
essence of this simple statistical test is to perform a stratiﬁed contingency
table analysis for the relationship between response and predictor variables
(cytotoxicity and kinase inhibition) while controlling binding promiscuity.
Speciﬁcally, a master 2 x 2 table for the whole compound library against
one kinase is split up into a series of partial tables consisting of inhibitors
with different levels of promiscuity designated as level p, as shown in
Supplementary Table S2.

Ratio: the number of toxic inhibitors / total number of inhibitors. “Protein kinases
remain signiﬁcant after CMH correction.

Here we classify the kinase inhibitors into three categories according to
the number of kinases a compound binds to: speciﬁc (binds to 1—3 kinases),
less speciﬁc (binds to 4—8 kinases) and promiscuous (binds to >8 kinases).
Supplementary Table S3 shows that the percentage of toxic Src inhibitors
increases nearly 2—fold from less promiscuous to highly promiscuous strata,
indicating that this increase is largely the result of increased inhibitor
promiscuity. Conversely, Aurora A kinase has similar percentage of toxic
inhibitors in two strata with different promiscuity, suggesting that the high
ratio of toxicity is likely to be the true reﬂection of kinase function and
independent of inhibitor cross—reactivity. Formally, a CMH test statistic can
be computed according to the following equation:

l7
A _ niopxnoip _ noianlthI/Z'OPXI/lilp
Where “00p -  ’WOOP)‘ —n%,.x<n..p—1>

It can be shown that this statistic follows a large sample chi—square
distribution with one degree of freedom under the null hypothesis that there
is no association between cytotoxicity and blockage of kinase activity after
controlling for target promiscuity. If the association remains strong after
combining the information from all distinct strata of covariates, a uniﬁed
statistical signiﬁcance can then be calculated to indicate that the induction
of cell cytotoxicity is independent of inhibitor promiscuity and likely to be
the consequence for the inactivation of the target kinase (Agresti, 2002).
Applying the CMH test to the list of kinases essentially eliminates the
majority of targets identiﬁed as important by the chi—square test. Only Aurora
A kinase and Par—1b (MARK2) still demonstrates a signiﬁcant CMH P—
value (table 1, column 4), suggesting that the kinase/phenotype association
is independent of confounding factor and therefore these two kinases is
essential for the cell homeostasis. A straightforward way to validate the
utility of CMH test in this setting is to test the cytotoxicity of highly
selective inhibitors whose biological effects can be more reliably attributed
to the inactivation of their target kinases. For c—Src and KDR, the top two
kinases that are signiﬁcant in the chi—square test but invalidated by CMH test,
we identiﬁed four speciﬁc inhibitors against them out of the whole library
that do not bind to any other kinases with high afﬁnity. These compounds’
cytotoxicity index is fairly low as shown in Table 2, essentially conﬁrming
that the association of c—Src and KDR inactivation with cell cytotoxicity is
primarily caused by the intrinsic promiscuity of their inhibitors instead of
the indispensability of kinase function. On the other hand, the most selective
inhibitors for Aurora—A kinase and Par—1b, which are the only two targets

so far, however, also binds seven other kinases with low afﬁnity (1 MM <
IC50 < 20 MM). Based on the low risk of weak inhibitors on cell survival
revealed by logistic regression model, it is likely that the cytotoxicity is
primarily elicited by the loss of Par—1b activity. In addition, among the 34
potent Aurora A kinase inhibitors that do not make the toxicity threshold,
nearly half of them (16/34) demonstrate border—line toxicity index between
40% and 50%. For the only four potent Par—1b inhibitors whose toxicity
index is <50%, three of them show border—line toxicity.

We also perform simulation study to demonstrate that CMH test reduces
the false discovery rate in a wide range of situations with various levels of r1
and r2, the correlation coefﬁcient shown in Figure 1a. Speciﬁcally, the low
r1 simulates the likes of Aurora A whose inhibitors with toxicity distribute
across the different promiscuity strata more evenly than Src and KDR. r2, as
the association coefﬁcient of confounding and dependent variables, simulates
the various mechanisms by which inhibitor off—target effect leads to cell
death. A low r2 would be the result of the additive effect of multiple isolated
signaling pathways blocked by one compound. The concomitant inactivation
of synergistic targets by non—speciﬁc inhibitors, on the other hand, results in
more pronounced cytotoxicity, reﬂected by a higher correlation coefﬁcient
(r2). In either case, these results demonstrate that CMH test is capable of
reducing false negatives resulted from confounding factor while not losing
signiﬁcant amount of statistical power when the confounding covariates are
less of concern (Supplementary Fig. S4). It shows that the CMH test is
a powerful method to distinguish the causal biological relationship from
unrelated confounding factors.

4 DISCUSSION

Besides gene knock—out models and small interference RNA
technology, gene function can be studied by chemical genetics using
small molecule intervention in the format of phenotypic screening
(Spring, 2005). Nevertheless, chemical perturbation studies are
vulnerable to the bias caused by the cross—reactivity of compound.
This is particularly true for kinase inhibitors because the targets
of inhibitors share a highly conserved substrate binding pocket.
In this study, we show that this issue can be at least partially
tackled by following a three—step statistical correction: association
identiﬁcation —> confounding factor conﬁrmation —> confounding
factor adjustment in order to infer causality of cytotoxicity
by the inhibition of house—keeping kinases (Supplementary Fig.
S3). Stratifying compound library based on the overall inhibitor
cross—reactivity is an effective strategy to reduce the type I errors
for target identiﬁcation arising from grossly promiscuous action of
non—speciﬁc inhibitors. Yet, it does not entirely solve the causality
issue for a relatively speciﬁc inhibitor, which binds to both the real
target and a small number of non—relevant kinases. Currently, this
adjustment invalidates the majority of kinases that have been listed

to be signiﬁcant for cell homeostasis by regular association methods
such as the chi—square test. Consistent with this result, our survey
of biological literature also indicates that many kinases on the list
indeed should not be essential to the basic homeostasis of cells. For
instance, c—Src knock—out mice exhibit largely normal phenotype
except in osteoblast most likely owing to the compensatory roles
played by Lyn and Yes, the two close homologs of c—Src (Klinghoffer
et al., 1999; Soriano et al., 1991). On the other hand, KDR gene
knockout in mice is embryonic lethal due to the defect in early
hematopoiesis and endothelial development (Shalaby et al., 1997).
However, it is in doubt whether these angiogenesis—related functions
would be crucial for the survival of HeLa cells, a human cervical
carcinoma cell line. More revealingly, all the highly speciﬁc potent
inhibitors against c—Src and KDR identiﬁed in this compound
library only show mild toxic phenotype measured by cytotoxicity
index. Conversely, the speciﬁc potent inhibitors for Aurora A and
Par—1b kinase, both of which remain signiﬁcant after the CMH
adjustment, lead to much higher degrees of toxicity. Besides the
strong experimental evidences, Aurora A kinase is well known for
its essential role in mitosis and the kinase null mice die at very
early embryonic stage due to the compromised spindle assembly
(Lu et al., 2008). Danusertib, a potent inhibitor for Aurora A, is
currently in Phase I clinical trials for the treatment of various
advanced solid tumors (Steeghs et al., 2009). The experimental
evidence for the role of Par—1b is less clear because the most
potent and selective Par—1B inhibitor (IC50 < 1 ,uM) we identiﬁed
in this study also inhibits seven other kinases with low afﬁnity.
The combinatorial knock—out of Par—1b and Par—1a, its closely
homologous gene, is embryonic lethal, raising the possibility of
inhibitor’s cross—reactivity to Par— 1a that is not included in our kinase
panel (Lennerz et al., 2010).

This approach has limitations. It foremost demands the extensive
off—target proﬁle be generated for all compounds before it can
be statistically adjusted, which is not always available. However,
our analysis offers compelling evidence that a snapshot of
cross—reactivity index from a restricted panel of targets can serve as a
good surrogate for a more comprehensive screen, which might have
prohibitive cost. Meanwhile, the public database such as PubChem
may also serve as an important resource for information on the
interaction proﬁles of interested chemicals to various biological
entities (Wang et al, 2010). Secondarily, our approach requires large
numbers of compounds with high diversity to be screened in order
to gain sufﬁcient statistical power. The pool of potent inhibitors
with toxicity also needs to be large enough so that they can be
stratiﬁed in order for adjustment of covariates. Another downside of
protein family focused screen is that the interaction of inhibitors with
random targets outside the targeted protein family is overlooked.
This limitation can only be circumvented by using more compounds
in that the general pattern drawn from a large library is less likely
to be inﬂuenced by the opportunistic off—target effects outside the
gene family that have been screened.

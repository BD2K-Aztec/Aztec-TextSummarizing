Abstract

Motivation: Metabolic modeling depends on accurately representing the cellular locations of en-
zyme-catalyzed and transport reactions. We sought to develop a representation of cellular compart-
mentation that would accurately capture cellular location information. We further sought a
representation that would support automated inference of the cellular compartments present in
newly sequenced organisms to speed model development, and that would enable representing the
cellular compartments present in multiple cell types within a multicellular organism.

Results: We define the cellular architecture of a unicellular organism, or of a cell type from a multi-
cellular organism, as the collection of cellular components it contains plus the topological relation-
ships among those components. We developed a tool for inferring cellular architectures across
many domains of life and extended our Cell Component Ontology to enable representation of the
inferred architectures. We provide software for visualizing cellular architectures to verify their cor-
rectness and software for editing cellular architectures to modify or correct them. We also de-
veloped a representation that records the cellular compartment assignments of reactions with min-
imal duplication of information.

Availability and implementation: The Cell Component Ontology is freely available. The Pathway
Tools software is freely available for academic research and is available for a fee for commercial use.

1 IntrOducuon A Cell Component Ontology (CCO) should be able to represent

Accurate representation of the compartmentation of the cell is an
important issue in metabolic modeling. In our quest to streamline
the processes of developing metabolic models, and of exchanging
models between different research groups, a number of issues related
to cellular compartmentation arise. What is the essential informa-
tion about cellular compartmentation that should be captured, and
how can it be effectively represented? How can we automatically
infer the cellular compartments of an organism when creating a new
metabolic model? When that automatic inference fails, how can we
facilitate manual adjustment of compartmentation by a user?

the universal set of cellular components from which all known cells
are built, as well as the particular cellular components from which a
specific type of cell is built. For multicellular organisms, the CC0
should be able to represent, within one database, the cellular compo-
nents of the multiple cell types present in that organism. Cell types in
multicellular organisms sometimes have different cellular architec-
tures, e.g. red blood cells lack nuclei. CCO should capture the infor-
mation needed to support the inference of the cellular architecture of
different organisms, such as by describing the typical organization of
cellular components in different types of organisms (e.g. the cellular

architecture of a typical plant versus a typical bacterium) in a way
that can be instantiated in a particular organism. Finally, CCO should
enable inferences about the spatial organization of cellular compart-
ments (e.g. if a transporter is assigned to a given membrane within a
cell, a program should be able to infer that the transporter transports
metabolites from the cellular space surrounding that membrane to the
cellular space surrounded by that membrane).

Accurate metabolic models must define the different sets of reac-
tions that occur within different cellular compartments of a given
cell type, and the exchange reactions that translocate metabolites
across cellular membranes. Consider the problem of modeling a
large community of interacting organisms by combining metabolic
models created by different research groups for individual organ-
isms. For example, imagine that we wanted to combine a human in-
testinal epithelial cell metabolic model derived from RECON2
Thiele et al. (2013) with models of bacteria from the gut microbiota
Shoaie and Nielsen (2014). If the individual models do not identify
their common extracellular space using a single shared identifier, it
will not be possible for the metabolites secreted by one organism to
be taken up by another organism. Furthermore, for consistency and
understandability it is desirable for different models to use the same
controlled vocabulary terms to refer to the same cellular compo-
nents, such as the bacterial inner membrane. Standardization of the
cellular compartments used in individual metabolic models would
clearly facilitate our ability to combine organism models created by
different research groups in a plug-and-play fashion. Currently, the
models produced by different research groups use a wide array of ad
hoc and incompatible compartment identifiers, e.g. ‘golgi apparatus’
[Recon 2 Thiele et al. (2013)] versus ‘golgi’ [Yeast 7 Heavner et al.
(2013)], ‘extra cellular space’ (Recon 2) versus ‘extracellular’ (Yeast
7), versus ‘extra-organism’ [MSB Chang et al. (2011)].

An overview of our approach to these problems is as follows. We
have updated our CCO Zhang et al. (2005) http://bioinformatics.ai.
sri.com/CCO/to enable the concurrent description of multiple cell
types within a single database and to permit development of meta-
bolic reconstructions that span multiple (e.g. human) cell types. The
CCO describes ‘surrounds’ relationships among compartments (e.g.
the cytosol surrounds the mitochondrion). Proteins, metabolites and
reactions within a Pathway/Genome Database (PGDB) can be anno-
tated with one or more CCO terms to define their cellular location(s).

Further, each CCO cellular component is labeled with the
National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) Taxonomy
identifiers of the taxonomic groups in which that component is ex-
pected to appear. This information enables inferring the cellular
components present in an organism, given its NCBI Taxonomy iden-
tifier, by the metabolic reconstruction module (PathoLogic) of our
Pathway Tools [overviewz Karp et al. (2015a); summary of recent
enhancements: Karp et al. (2015b)] software. We refer to the set of
cellular components present in a unicellular organism, or in a type
of cell from a multicellular organism, plus the topological relation-
ships among those cellular components, as the cellular architecture.
When a user finds the cellular architecture of an organism to be in
error, they can use the new Cellular Architecture Editor within
Pathway Tools to revise the cellular architecture. The MetaFlux
Karp et al. (2015b) metabolic modeling module within Pathway
Tools uses the CCO terms attached to metabolic and transport reac-
tions to assign those reactions to appropriate cellular compartments
within a metabolic model.

We have defined a mapping between CCO terms and Gene
Ontology (GO) Gene Ontology Consortium (2015) terms to maxi-
mize the standardization of CCO while enabling it to be extended
independently of GO when necessary.

2.1 Cell component ontology

CCO is implemented as a set of class terms and a set of instance
terms. Each leaf CCO class term describes a general type of cellular
component (e.g. class term CCO-RGH-ER-MEM describes the class
of all rough endoplasmic reticulum membranes found in all cell
types). Parent CCO class terms define an IS-A hierarchy above these
leaf class terms (e.g. class term CCO-MEMBRANE defines the class
of all membranes and is an IS-A parent of CCO-RGH-ER-MEM).

CCO instance terms describe specific cellular components found
in specific cell types. For example, instance term CCI-RGH-ER-
MEM-1 (an instance of CCO-RGH-ER-MEM) might describe the
rough endoplasmic reticulum membrane found in a human red
blood cell in the HumanCyc database Romero et al. (2004), and
instance CCI-RGH-ER-MEM-2 might describe the rough endoplas-
mic reticulum membrane found in a human hepatocyte in the
HumanCyc database.

Table 1 lists the slots (database fields) defined for CCO terms.
These slots are used to provide metadata that define the meanings of
CCO terms, and to define spatial relationships among CCO terms.
Based on these spatial relationships, we have written software that
creates cartoons depicting cellular architectures such as that shown
for Escherichia coli in Figure 1. These cartoons enable users to
quickly validate the correctness of the cellular architecture defined
by a collection of CCO terms (that is, to validate that the cellular
architecture contains the correct set of organelles and their

Supplementary Figure S1 contains generated cartoons for a number
of other organisms (a Gram-positive bacterium, a cyanobacterium, a
plant, a trypanosome, a human liver cell and a human red blood
cell) to demonstrate the range of cellular architectures that can be
captured with CCO. Note that the software that generates the car-
toons currently omits cell projections, such as flagella, because our
SURROUNDS/SURROUNDED-BY relationships do not capture the
geometry of these components relative to other cell components.

CCO contains seven primitive types of entities, each described
by a top-level class within the ontology:

° Membranes

° Spaces

° Organelles

° Sub-organelle compartments (e.g. golgi cisterna)

° Cell envelopes

° Super-components that consist of a space plus other entities con-
tained within the space (e.g. the cytoplasm or a spore)

° A cell-surface matrix such as a cell wall

2.2 Cellular compartments of reactions and metabolites
Here, we describe how Pathway Tools represents the compartments
of reactions and metabolites to facilitate metabolic modeling.
Supplementary File S1 provides a tutorial on how to interactively as-
sign reaction compartments within Pathway Tools.

One key design goal is avoiding unnecessary duplication of infor-
mation. Thus, we create a single object for a given metabolite or a
given reaction in a PGDB, even if biologically, a metabolite or a re-
action occurs in more than one compartment. Reactions can be

annotated with information about what compartments they reside
in. Because metabolites are connected to the reactions, we infer that
if metabolite M is a reactant or product of reaction R, then M is pre-
sent in all of the locations in which R is present.

Another goal is reusing reactions curated in MetaCyc Caspi et al.
(2014) (our universal reaction database). When PathoLogic infers
Karp et al. (2011) the reactions present in an organism, it imports
those reactions from MetaCyc into the new PGDB created for that
organism. This implies that a reaction must have an abstract descrip-
tion of how it fits topologically into a cell’s architecture, without
relying on hard-coding potentially exotic compartments that might
not even exist in the new target PGDB. Instead, PathoLogic should
be able to assign the correct, concrete compartments for the reaction
in the target PGDB. For example, consider the reaction for the
choline:H+ symporter, which transports choline. That transport
event might take place across different membranes in different or-
ganisms. The MetaCyc transport reaction must describe in an ab-
stract way whether choline is on the inside or outside relative to the
membrane that is crossed, both on the left and right sides of the re-
action equation. We assume that the inside is surrounded by the out-
side. In this example, if Pathologic imports the reaction into a
Gram-positive bacterium, then the inside will be equated with the
cytosol and the outside with the extracellular space. However, if this
reaction is imported into a Gram-negative bacterium, then the inside
will again be equated with the cytosol, whereas the outside will now
be equated with the periplasmic space.

We define two types of reactions:

° S-reactions (S 2 Same) are reactions in which all reactants and
products (jointly: substrates) of the reaction reside in the same
compartment. This is the most common type of metabolic reac-
tion and corresponds to enzyme-catalyzed reactions. The sub-
strates of S-reactions are stored in slots called LEFT (reactants)
and RIGHT (products), respectively.

° T—reactions (T 2 Transport) are reactions whose substrates are
translocated from one compartment to another, crossing a mem-
brane. Their substrates reside in more than one compartment,
most commonly, two compartments. Some T-reactions involve
translocation but no chemical modiﬁcation, whereas other T-re-
actions chemically modify their substrates (e.g. phosphoryl-
ation). T-reaction substrates are also stored in the LEFT and
RIGHT slots.

The coefficients of substrates in both S-reactions and T-reactions
are stored by using a database structure called an annotation, which
is provided by the Ocelot database Karp et al. (1999) system used by
Pathway Tools. An annotation is a labeled list of data values that
can be attached to a slot value. For example, if the reactant H20
had a coefficient of 2 in the LEFT slot of a given reaction, we would
attach the Annotation 2 under the label COEFFICIENT to the value
H20 in the LEFT slot of that reaction.

The locations of the substrates within S-reactions and T-
reactions are assigned by using the following approaches.

S—reaction location assignment: Because the substrates of all S-
reactions are located in the same compartment, by specifying the
compartment of the reaction, we specify the locations of all of its
substrates. By default, if no location information is asserted
for them, S-reactions are presumed to be located in the cytosol
(specifically, CCO-CYTOSOL). If an S-reaction occurs in a non-
default compartment, or in several compartments, then the RXN-
LOCATIONS slot of that reaction stores the CCO identifier of each
such compartment (which must all be children of CCO-SPACE).
The metabolites in the reaction’s LEFT and RIGHT slots are

interpreted as existing together in every compartment listed in the
RXN-LOCATIONS slot.

The following example first shows the equation of an S-reaction
located in the periplasm; it then shows the internals of the object
representing the S-reaction. That object has the slots LEFT and
RIGHT, containing metabolite objects as their values, and slot
RXN-LOCATIONS, containing a CCO object as its value.

An example of an S—reaction in the periplasmic
space:

phosphate[periplasmicspace]
ReactionPHOSPHOGLYCERATE—PHOSPHATASE—RXN

LEFT:2—PG,WATER
RIGHT:GLYCERATE,Pi
RXN—LOCATIONS:CCO—PERI—BAC

T—reaction location assignment: We specify the locations of T-re-
action substrates by specifying the membrane(s) that the T-reaction
spans, and by specifying the locations of each substrate relative
to each membrane. T-reactions do not have a default membrane
assignment, because for cells with multiple organelle membranes,
which membrane should be the default is unclear. The membrane(s)
spanned by a T-reaction are stored in the RXNS-LOCATIONS
slot of the reaction. The relative locations of each T-reaction sub-
strate are specified by using abstract location annotations called
CCO-IN and CCO-OUT. This information is combined program-
matically to derive specific locations for every substrate in a
T-reaction.

For each membrane spanned by a T-reaction, the CCO-IN and
CCO-OUT annotations on a substrate specify whether the substrate
resides inside that membrane, or outside the membrane. These ab-
stract compartment annotations on the metabolites carry the label
COMPARTMENT. The RXN-LOCATIONS slot further specifies,
for each membrane, bindings of CCO-IN and CCO-OUT to actual
compartment spaces.

An example of a transport reaction in the periplasmic mem-
brane, also called the inner membrane, is shown as follows. In
this example, the transport reaction bridges the membrane CCO-
PM-BAC-NEG (the periplasmic membrane of a Gram-negative bac-
terium), and the pair of bindings declares that CCO-IN maps
to CCO-CYTOSOL, and CCO-OUT maps to CCO-PERI-BAC.
The representation for this example depicts the annotations of a
slot value on a new line underneath the value itself, with
three dashes preceding the label of an annotation, followed by the
value of the annotation. For example, the value CCO-PM-BAC-
NEG is annotated with the value CCO-CYTOSOL under the label
CCO-IN.

An example of a T—reaction in the inner membrane:

D—glycerate[periplasmic space] —> D—glycerate
[cytosol]
Reaction TRANS—RXNO—523
LEFT:
GLYCERATE
—COMPARTMENT:CCO-OUT
RIGHT:
GLYCERATE
—COMPARTMENT:CCO—IN

RXN—LOCATIONS:
CCO-PM—BAC—NEG
—CCO-IN:CCO-CYTOSOL—CCO-OUT:CCO—PERI—BAC

Here, we provide an example of how the location of a substrate
within this T-reaction is computed by the following Pathway Tools
Application Program Interface (API) call:

get—reactant— location (TRANS—RXNO— 523 ,
GLYCERATE,
CCO-PM—BAC—NEG)

The API first queries whether glycerate has CCO-IN or CCO-OUT
as its abstract compartment. Its annotation for the label
COMPARTMENT is CCO-OUT. Next we look up the specific loca-
tion by examining the annotation that has the label that is the same
as the abstract compartment we found at the substrate, namely
CCO-OUT. This finally leads us to CCO-PERI-BAC as the specific
location of GLYCERATE on the LEFT side.

Whenever a reaction is transferred by PathoLogic from MetaCyc
to a new PGDB as part of reaction inference, all values in the RXN-
LOCATIONS slot are filtered away (i.e. not copied). This prevents in-
applicable compartments from being introduced into other PGDBs.
Instead, inferring appropriate compartments will be the responsibility
of Pathologic; in future work, PathoLogic will infer reaction locations
based on information such as protein signal sequences.

2.3 Inference of cellular architecture

Our convention is for every PGDB to contain all CCO classes to de-
fine the universe of cellular components—even for cellular compo-
nents not present in that organism. However, instances of those
classes are defined for only those cellular components that are pre-
sent in the organism. A PathoLogic module infers the instances to
create (and thus, the cellular architecture of the organism) based on
the taxonomic class to which the organism belongs. Curators can
edit the cellular architecture to make any needed corrections, as
described in the next section.

The inference process uses information present in the CCO
classes. The SENSU slot of each CCO class term links (via NCBI
taxonomy id) to those taxa that can potentially contain that compo-
nent. The linked taxa can be very general—many components, such
as the cytosol, the plasma membrane and the extracellular space,
will be applicable to all organisms. Or they can be quite specific (for
example the CCO-THY-CYA class, which describes the cyanobac-
terial thylakoid, is specific for Cyanobacteria). Some class terms
have several values for this slot (for example, the CCO-PERI-BAC
class, which refers to the periplasm in Gram-negative bacteria, links
to all of the bacterial taxa that have an outer membrane enclosing a
periplasm). Thus, given the taxonomic group of an organism, we
can automatically infer which CCO terms are expected to belong to
that organism. We do not actually create instances for every one of
these class terms, just for the ‘leaf’ class terms (i.e. those that do not
have a more specific class). For example, CCO-PLASMA-MEM
refers to the plasma membrane and is present in all organisms, but
its subclass CCO-PM-BAC-NEG specifically represents the plasma
membrane in Gram-negative bacteria (analogous subclasses exist for
other taxa—taxon-specific subclasses are necessary because different
taxa can have different values for the SURROUNDS or
COMPONENTS relationships). For a Gram-negative bacterium, we
would create an instance only of the latter, more specific class.

After the software has created a set of instance terms for an or-
ganism, it copies the SURROUNDS and COMPONENTS

relationships from the parent classes to the corresponding instances.
Sometimes multiple instances for a given class term must be created
and correctly linked. For example, CCO contains class terms for sev-
eral different kinds of vesicles (e.g. endocytic vesicles, synaptic ves-
icles, etc.). The components of a vesicle are the vesicle membrane
and the vesicle lumen. For each kind of vesicle present in an organ-
ism, a different vesicle membrane instance and vesicle lumen in-
stance must be created, and each membrane instance must surround
the correct lumen instance.

After the set of instances and their interrelationships have been
created for an organism, we should have a consistent picture of the
cellular components for that organism that can be used to, say, draw
a cartoon such as in Figure 1 or to determine the appropriate mem-
branes and spaces for transport reactions.

2.4 Cellular Architecture Editor

Although we have invested considerable effort to ensure that the
SENSU values described earlier are as accurate and precise as pos-
sible, some cases will exist in which the set of components inferred
based on taxonomy will not be entirely correct. For example, many
but not all Euglenids have chloroplasts, but because the chloroplast-
related terms all link to the Euglenid taxon (among others), those
terms will be inferred by default for all Euglenids, even the non-
photosynthetic ones. Thus, we also provide a Cellular Architecture
Editor, so that a curator can correct the set of cellular components
belonging to an organism. This editor can also be used to define the
architecture of different cell types in a multicellular organism—for
example, although both are human, the set of components in a
human erythrocyte is very different than that in a human
hepatocyte.

The Cellular Architecture Editor, shown in Figure 2, enables the
user to select which cellular components are present or absent in a
particular organism or cell type. It does not list every possible CCO
class term, however. Terms are organized into three categories: (i)
cell envelope and exterior components, (ii) membrane-bound organ-
elles and (iii) other. If the curator specifies that a particular organelle
is present, then all of its component terms are automatically
included also. For example, if an organism includes the mitochon-
drion, then it automatically also includes the terms for the mito-
chondrial membranes, lumen, intermembrane space, etc. The editor
can be preset with the components present in a generic plant, ani-
mal, fungal, Gram-negative or Gram-positive bacterial cell, or with
the set of inferred components for the current organism. This ability
enables easily starting with a reasonable base set of components and
then just adding or subtracting whatever is necessary.

2.5 Mapping between CCO and GO

Most CCO terms contain links to the corresponding term in the GO
cellular component ontology. However, several differences exist be-
tween CCO and GO.

GO contains a great many more terms than CCO because it
chooses to represent cellular components at a higher level of detail
than we do, often all the way down to individual protein complexes.
For our purposes, we have chosen to keep CCO focused on large-
scale cellular compartments and structures. Because these more spe-
cific GO terms are generally parts of components whose terms do
have mappings to CCO, we have no trouble determining the appro-
priate correspondence.

Both GO and CCO represent two kinds of relationships between
terms: IS-A relationships and PART-OF relationships. In addition,
CCO represents a third kind of relationship not present in GO, the

SURROUNDED-BY relationship, which, as we have seen earlier,
lets us infer the topology of a cell. As a consequence, CCO some-
times has several sensu-specific terms that map to a single GO term.
For example, in addition to the CCO term CCO-PLASMA-MEM,
the cell plasma membrane, which corresponds to the GO term
GO:0005 886, CCO has additional child terms for the plasma mem-
brane in plants, animals, fungi and Gram-negative and Gram-posi-
tive bacteria. These additional terms exist in CCO to enable us to
represent the different SURROUNDED-BY relationships in different
taxa. For example, the Gram-negative plasma membrane is sur-
rounded by the bacterial periplasm, whereas the Gram-positive
plasma membrane is surrounded by the extracellular space.
Although these sensu-specific CCO terms do not directly link to any
GO term, generating a mapping between the two vocabularies if the
organism taxon is known is trivial.

A small number of CCO terms lack any mapping to GO. These
terms are mostly very high-level generic concepts, such as

CCO-SPACE (any 3D extent, typically bound by and/or surround-
ing a membrane, such as the cytosol, extracellular-space and various
organelle lumens) and CCO-SUBORG-CMPT (the parent of all sub-
organelle compartments). Because we do not expect any proteins or
reaction substrates to be assigned directly to any of these terms, the
lack of corresponding GO terms should not cause any problems. We
also have a term CCO-UNKNOWN-SPACE to help us explicitly
represent uncertainty, which GO chooses not to do. Finally, a few
generic CCO instance terms—such as CCO-SIDE-1, CCO-SIDE-2
and CCO-BOUNDARY—are placeholders that enable us to define
generic transport reactions in MetaCyc without reference to any spe-
cific membrane or compartments. When these reactions are brought
into an organism-specific database, the generic terms must be
mapped to specific cellular components within that cell’s
architecture.

The earlier exceptions notwithstanding, the mapping between
CCO and GO means that outputting the cellular location of any
protein or reaction substrate by using either vocabulary is straight-
forward. In fact, in our internal representation, we make use of
both. Protein locations are encoded by using GO terms (to use the
higher level of detail contained in GO, and to facilitate exchange
with other databases that use GO), and the corresponding CCO
terms are computed. The locations of reaction substrates are
encoded by using CCO, because for reactions, the topology defined
by the SURROUNDED-BY relationships is paramount.

3 Discussion

The representations described herein are used to describe cellular
architectures in all of the organisms listed in Figure 1 and in
Supplementary Figure S1. These representations are used to describe
reaction locations in EcoCyc Keseler et al. (2013) and HumanCyc
and are used in the metabolic model generated from EcoCyc Weaver
et al. (2014).

Currently, metabolic models produced by different research groups
use varying ad hoc schemes for labeling cellular compartments. This
approach slows and complicates the utilization of both individual
metabolic models (where the meanings of compartment names may be
unclear) and attempts to combine multiple individual models into
larger community models—if different models use different labels for
the same compartments, the modeling software will not realize what
compartments are shared by different organisms. We recommend
CCO as a standard for describing the architectures of cells for use in
metabolic models, and Pathway Tools uses CCO terms when export-
ing its metabolic models to Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML) Hucka et al. (2003).

4 Conclusions

We define the cellular architecture of a unicellular organism, or a
cell type from a multicellular organism, as the collection of cellular
components it contains plus the topological relationships among
those components. We have extended our CCO to enable inferring
the cellular architectures of cell types across many domains of life.
One extension annotates the CCO classes that represent cellular

components with taxonomic identifiers that indicate the taxa in
which those cellular components are found. Another extension en-
ables creating multiple instances of those classes, where each in-
stance describes a component present in a different cell type. The
Pathway Tools software contains tools to visualize cellular architec-
tures to enable their verification, and editing to modify or correct
cellular architectures.

We also developed a representation that records the cellular
compartment assignments of a reaction within the reaction object,
thus avoiding duplication of reactions.

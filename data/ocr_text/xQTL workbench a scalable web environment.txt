ABSTRACT

Summary: xQTL workbench is a scalable web platform for the
mapping of quantitative trait loci (QTLS) at multiple levels: for example
gene expression (eQTL), protein abundance (pQTL), metabolite
abundance (mQTL) and phenotype (thTL) data. Popular QTL
mapping methods for model organism and human populations are
accessible via the web user interface. Large calculations scale easily
on to multi-core computers, clusters and Cloud. All data involved can
be uploaded and queried online: markers, genotypes, microarrays,
NGS, LC-MS, GC-MS, NMR, etc. When new data types come
available, xQTL workbench is quickly customized using the Molgenis
software generator.

Availability: xQTL workbench runs on all common platforms,
including Linux, Mac OS X and Windows. An online demo system,
installation guide, tutorials, software and source code are available
under the LGPL3 license from http://www.xqtl.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modern high—throughput technologies generate large amounts
of genomic, transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic data.
However, existing open source web—based tools for QTL analysis,
such as webQTL (Wang et al., 2003) and QTLNetwork (Yang
et al., 2008), are not easily extendable to different settings
and computationally scalable for whole genome analyses. xQTL
workbench makes it easy to analyse large and complex datasets
using state—of—the—art QTL mapping tools and to apply these methods
to millions of phenotypes using parallelized ‘Big Data’ solutions
(Trelles et al., 2011). xQTL workbench also supports storing of raw,
intermediate and ﬁnal result data, and analysis protocols and history
for reproducibility and data provenance. Use of Molgenis (Swertz
et al., 2010a) helps to customize the software. All is conveniently
accessible Via standard Internet browsers on Windows, Linux or Mac
(and using Java, R for the server).

2 FEATURES

xQTL workbench provides Visualization of QTL proﬁles, single and
multiple QTL mapping methods, easy addition of new QTL analyses,
scalable data management and analysis tracking.

2.1 Explore QTL proﬁles

Through the web interface, users can explore mapped QTLs, and
underlying information by Viewing QTL plots in an interactive
scrollable and zoomable window. xQTL workbench has support
for other common image formats, such as PNG, JPG, SVG and
embedded postscript; useful for publishing scientiﬁc results online,
and on paper. From the output, main database identiﬁers, such as
gene, protein and/or metabolite identiﬁers are automatically linked—
out to matching external web pages of public database such as NCBI,
KEGG and Wormbase.

2.2 Single and multiple QTL mapping

xQTL workbench wraps R/qtl (Arends et al., 2010; Broman
et al., 2003) in a web—based analysis framework offering all
important QTL mapping routines, such as the EM algorithm,
imputation, Haley—Knott regression, the extended Haley—Knott
method, marker regression and Multiple QTL mapping. In addition,
xQTL workbench includes R/qtlbim, a library that provides a
Bayesian model selection approach for mapping multiple interacting
QTL (Yandell et al., 2007) and Plink, a library for association
QTL mapping on single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in natural
populations (Purcell et al., 2007).

2.3 Add new analysis tools

xQTL workbench supports ﬂexible adding of more QTL analysis
software: any R—based, or command—line tool, can be plugged in.
All analysis results are uploaded, stored and tracked in the xQTL
workbench database through an R—API. When new tools are added,
they can build on the high—level multi—core computer, cluster and
Cloud management functions, based on TORQUE/OpenPBS and
BioNode (Prins et al., 2011). xQTL workbench can be made part
of a larger analysis pipeline using interfaces to R, Excel, REST and
SOAP web services and Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010).

2.4 Track analysis and monitor performance

When a new analysis protocol or R script is deﬁned, this protocol
can easily be applied to new data. Also, xQTL workbench keeps
track of history. Re—use of analysis protocols can be done in an
automated fashion. Previous analyses can be rerun without resetting
parameters. xQTL workbench provides an online overview of past
analyses e.g. which analyses were performed, by who, when and
display settings applied.

2.5 Scalable data management

xQTL workbench has a consistency checking database based on
XGAP speciﬁcation (Swertz et al., 2010b), user interfaces to manage
and query genotype and phenotype datasets and support for various
database back—ends including HSQL (standalone) and MySQL.
Phenotype, genotype and genetic map data can be imported as text
(TXT), comma separated (CSV) and Excel ﬁles. xQTL workbench
handles and stores large data in a new and efﬁcient binary edition of
the XGAP format, named XGAPbin (extension .xbin), documented
online. Such binary formats are essential when handling, storing and
transporting multi—Gigabyte datasets.

2.6 Customizable to research needs

Additional modules for new data modalities can be added using
Molgenis software generator (Swertz et al., 2010b). The ‘look and
feel’ of xQTL workbench is adaptable to institute or consortium style
by changing a simple template, which is described in the xQTL
workbench documentation enabling seamless integration into an
existing website or intranet site, such as recently for EU—PANACEA
model organism project and LifeLines biobank.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

We built xQTL workbench on top of Molgenis (Swertz et al.,
2004), a Java—based software to generate tailored research
infrastructure on—demand (Swertz and Jansen, 2007). From a single
‘blueprint’ describing the whole system, Molgenis auto—generates
a full application including user interface, database infrastructure,
application programming interfaces in R, REST and SOAP (APIs).
Molgenis’ ﬂexibility and robustness is proven by the wide range
of research projects, e.g. the Nordic GWAS Control database (Leu
et al., 2010), EB mutation database (van den Akker et al., 2011) and
the Animal observation database (Swertz et al., 2010a).

For data storage, the eXtensible Genotype and Phenotype (XGAP)
data model was adopted (Swertz et al., 2010b) and extended for big
data. To support the increased demand for computational resources
for included mapping routines, we added high—level cluster and
cloud management functions for computation. The scalable QTL
mapping routines of xQTL workbench are written in R and C.
The choice of R ties in with the general practice of using R for
QTL mapping. The user interface includes direct access to the R
interpreter. Both xQTL workbench and Molgenis are open—source
software, and source code is transparently stored and tracked in
online source control repositories.

4 CONCLUSION

xQTL workbench provides a total solution for web—based analysis:
major QTL mapping routines are integrated for use by experienced

and inexperienced users. Researchers can upload raw data, run
analyses, explore mapped QTL and underlying information, and
link—out to important databases. New algorithms can be ﬂexibly
added, immediately available to all users. Large analyses can be
easily executed on a cluster or in the Cloud. Future work include
visualizations and search options to explore the results. We also had
an EU—SYSGENET workshop that envisioned further integration of
xQTL with analysis tools like HAPPY, databases like GeneNetwork,
and the workﬂow manager TIQS (Durrant et al., 2011).

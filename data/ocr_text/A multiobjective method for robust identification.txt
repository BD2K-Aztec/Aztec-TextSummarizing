ABSTRACT

Motivation: Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have major roles in the
post-transcriptional regulation in prokaryotes. The experimental valid-
ation of a relatively small number of sRNAs in few species requires
developing computational algorithms capable of robustly encoding the
available knowledge and using this knowledge to predict sRNAs within
and across species.

Results: We present a novel methodology designed to identify bacter-
ial sRNAs by incorporating the knowledge encoded by different sRNA
prediction methods and optimally aggregating them as potential pre-
dictors. Because some of these methods emphasize specificity,
whereas others emphasize sensitivity while detecting sRNAs, their op-
timal aggregation constitutes trade-off solutions between these two
contradictory objectives that enhance their individual merits. Many
non-redundant optimal aggregations uncovered by using multiobjec-
tive optimization techniques are then combined into a multiclassifier,
which ensures robustness during detection and prediction even in gen-
omes with distinct nucleotide composition. By training with sRNAs in
Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, we were able to successfully predict
sRNAs in Sinorhizobium meliloti, as well as in multiple and poorly anno-
tated species. The proposed methodology, like a meta-analysis ap-
proach, may begin to lay a possible foundation for developing robust
predictive methods across a wide spectrum of genomic variability.

1 INTRODUCTION

Small non-coding RNAs (sRNAs) have major roles in the bac-
terial post-transcriptional regulation, affecting important cellular
processes such as cell division ONassarman and Storz, 2000) and
response to environmental stimuli (Majdalani and Gottesman,
2005), among others. Experimental methods, including next-
generation sequencing technologies, are critical for the functional
characterization of sRNAs (Sittka et al., 2009). However, the
experimental veriﬁcation of a relatively small number of

sRNAs, primarily in Escherichia coli K12 (Argaman et al.,
2001; Rivas, 2005) and Salmonella enterica serovar
T yphimurium LT2 (SLT2) (Padalon-Brauch et al., 2008;
Pfeiffer et al., 2007; Sittka et al., 2009; Vogel, 2009), is not suf-
ﬁcient to help detect them in the large list of available sequenced
genomes. Therefore, there is a requirement of developing com-
putational algorithms capable of robustly encoding the know-
ledge of known sRNAs available in certain genomes and using
this knowledge to predict sRNAs in other species (Sridhar and
Gunasekaran, 2013).

The computational identiﬁcation of non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs), which includes sRNAs, (ribosomal RNAs) rRNAs
and transfer RNAs (tRNAs), is constrained by their diversity
in terms of structures, sequences and functions (Livny et al.,
2005; Lu et al., 2011; Pichon and Felden, 2003; Rivas and
Eddy, 2000, 2001; Storz et al., 2011). Structures of ncRNAs
are often scored based on thermodynamic stability, conservation
and/or covariance of sequence alignments. Sequences of
ncRNAs are primarily analyzed by using two strategies: ab
initio, which scrutinizes a single-query sequence [e.g. zMFold
(Babak et al., 2007; Zuker, 2003), vsFold (Dawson et al.,
2007)] and comparative [e.g. QRNA (Rivas and Eddy, 2001),
Alifoldz (Washietl and Hofacker, 2004), dynalign (Mathews
and Turner, 2002), MSARi (Coventry et al., 2004) and RNAz2
(Gruber et al., 2010)], where the query sequence is investigated by
its similarity to other aligned sequences. The latter strategy re-
quires methods for accessing databases, as well as heuristics to
efﬁciently evaluate similarity among sequences. Both strategies
require classiﬁers [e.g. support vector machines (Gruber et al.,
2010) or customized hidden Markov models (Rivas and Eddy,
2001)] to predict new ncRNAs based on the acquired knowledge
in the training phase. Remarkably, most of the training sets cur-
rently used to predict sRNAs are composed of positive examples
of rRNAs and tRNAs, which are easier to identify than sRNAs
because of their longer sequences and well-deﬁned structure.

Although several methods have been developed and represent a
step forward in the computational detection of sRNAs, their suc-
cess is limited because of (i) the excessive emphasis on speciﬁcity,
which generates a high number of false-negative predictions by
targeting few well-known sRNA families corresponding only to a
small percentage of the available sRNAs, (ii) the use of genomic
features (e.g. motifs of terminators, RNA polymerase) that are
only conserved in closely related organisms [e.g. E.coli and
Salmonella (Argaman et al., 2001; Vogel, 2009)] and thus cause

a large number of false-negative predictions in distantly related
organisms and (iii) the emphasis on sensitivity to detect novel
ﬁndings by thermodynamical approaches, where several ex-
amples shown in bacterial genomes harbor well-deﬁned second-
ary structures and high thermodynamical stability (Eddy, 2001)
but do not correspond to true sRNA sequences (Xu et al., 2009)
(i.e. predicted false-positive ﬁndings). Combining pairs of these
methods partially overcome these limitations (del Val et al., 2007;
Lu et al., 2011). For example, we previously combined QRNA
and RNAz to identify sRNAs in Sinorhizobium meliloti; however,
the signiﬁcant reduction in the number of false-positive ﬁndings
leads to very low sensitivity (del Val et al., 2007).

The performance of a classiﬁer or prediction method may be
improved when combining different methods and thus suggests
a path to improve bacterial sRNA prediction through meta-
analyses of results from existing tools. Therefore, here we pro-
pose a new methodology (Fig. 1), which performs optimal
aggregations of existing methods—termed basic methods—to
predict sRNAs by using machine learning and optimization tech-
niques. This strategy minimizes the false-positive rate during
detection and prediction and, simultaneously, maximizes the
number of sRNA identiﬁed, independently of the evaluated
genome. We trained our methodology using the SLT2 genome,
which is the Gammaproteobacteria model organism harboring
the highest number of experimentally validated sRNAs. The re-
sulting strategy was later successfully applied to predict sRNAs
in S.melil0ti, a distant Alphaproteobacteria of a great agricultural
importance, that has not been used in the training set and has
numerous annotated sRNAs (Ulvé et al., 2007; Venkova-Canova
et al., 2004). Finally, the strategy was tested in a multispecies
dataset (Lu et al., 2011). The performance achieved by our meth-
odology when compared with that of the basic or pairwise

combinations of methods demonstrated that the proposed meth-
odology is accurate and robust to detect sRNAs even in distantly
related species. Note that our approach does not invalidate meth-
ods developed de novo but complements them by providing an
efﬁcient way of combining their most reliable features and thus
extracts the maximum beneﬁts from each method. Our approach
might bring some light into the development of robust predictive
methods across a wide spectrum of genomic variability.

2 METHODS

2.1 Selection of basic methods for predicting sRNAs

We selected different methods developed to identify sRNAs as inputs.
These include zMFold (Babak et al., 2007; Zuker, 2003), vsFold (Dawson
et al., 2007), QRNA (Rivas and Eddy, 2001), Alifoldz (Washietl and
Hofacker, 2004), dynalign (Mathews and Turner, 2002), MSARi
(Coventry et al., 2004) and RNAzZ (Gruber et al., 2010) (see
Supplementary Material for speciﬁc description and parameters). They
exhibit different characteristics in terms of their subjacent algorithms (i.e.
covering all three main approaches to RNA prediction: thermodynamic
stability, conservation and covariance of sequence alignments), imple-
mentation strategy and subjacent training sets (Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Creation of positive and negative training datasets

To train our methodology, we created a dataset with both positive and
negative examples of sRNAs in the bacterial genome of SLT2
(Supplementary Fig. S1). This organism was selected as a model organism
because it harbors a large number of veriﬁed sRNAs. The SLT2 dataset
of positive examples includes 193 experimentally veriﬁed sRNAs
(Supplementary Table S2). A total of 52 sRNAs were identiﬁed by
RNA-seq experiments, whereas the others were identiﬁed by traditional
experimental approaches (Padalon-Brauch et al., 2008; Papenfort et al.,
2008; Pfeiffer et al., 2007; Sittka et al., 2008, 2009) or registered in spe-
cialized databases such as RFAM (RFAM version 10.0; Grifﬁths-Jones
et al., 2005). To simulate real prediction conditions, we added the 120 nt
upstream and downstream of each sequence in the dataset.

Some of the basic methods selected for this study (Supplementary
Table S 1) use a comparative strategy and therefore need similar sequences
in other species. Our positive dataset includes pairwise or multiple align-
ment of sequences. These methods are highly dependent on the similarity
between the sequences constituting the input alignments. The most in-
formative alignments are composed of sequences sharing between 60 and
85% of similarity (Rivas, 2005). To achieve these standards, we selected
sequences from E.c0li K12, Klebsiella pneumonia, X ylella fastidiosa and
Yersinia pestis KIM (genome sequences and annotations were down-
loaded from the NCBI ftp server, ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/
Bacteria). Pairwise alignments were performed by using NCBI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1990) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/), with a word size of
8, and default parameters. Alignments with an E-value> 0.00001 and a
length< 50 nt were discarded. Multiple alignments were based on previ-
ously calculated pairwise alignments by using T-COFFEE (Notredame
et al., 2000). This algorithm uses the pairwise alignments to build up a
library of alignment information that guides the progressive multiple
alignments. This progressive strategy provides a dramatic improvement
in accuracy with a modest sacriﬁce in speed when compared with other
multiple alignment alternatives (N otredame et al., 2000).

To estimate false-positive predictions, we generated a dataset of nega-
tive examples by shufﬂing the individual, pairwise and multiple-aligned
sequences in the positive dataset. Individual sequences were shufﬂed
using the program shufﬂeseq (Rice et al., 2000), which is included in
the emboss package. This script takes an input sequence and randomly
shufﬂes the order of its base without affecting the composition. Aligned

Identification of bacterial small non-coding RNAs

 

sequences were randomly shufﬂed using the shufﬂe-pair.pl method
(Babak et al., 2007). This method preserves the properties of the original
sequences or alignments (e.g. overall guanine-cytosine (GC) content, %
identity, distributions of identities, mismatches and gaps), while destroys
correlated base-pairing patterns in a conserved RNA structure. An alter-
native approach is to consider genome regions without annotated sRNAs
as negative examples (Lu et al., 2011). However, absence of knowledge
does not imply knowledge of absence, and there are many examples in
our previous work in transcriptional regulation where non-meaningful
genomic regions resulted in truly functional genomic regions (Zwir
et al., 2005). Therefore, we believe that a synthetic negative dataset
based on shufﬂing of the positive dataset sequences secures the disruption
of secondary structures implicated in sRNAs and thus may produce less
uncertainty about negative examples and better estimation of speciﬁcity.
However, the use of non-annotated sequences as negative dataset would
be a better choice if a more conservative estimate of the precision is
envisaged.

2.3 Aggregations of basic methods

The aggregation of methods is performed by systematically applying the
union —U— and intersection —ﬂ— operations (Supplementary Fig. S2) to
sets of predictions performed by basic or previous aggregations of meth-
ods (Fig. 1). These aggregations are reminiscent of logic expressions repre-
senting combined predictions. The union operation (methodA U methodB)
reports the largest subsequences predicted or covered by any of the
operands (Supplementary Fig. S3a). The intersection operation
(methodA ﬂ methodB) reports a sequence embracing only those nucleo-
tides predicted by both operands (Supplementary Fig. S3b).

2.4 Evaluation of methods: sensitivity and speciﬁcity

The evaluation of results from basic or aggregation of methods was
carried out in a similar fashion. A query sequence in either the positive
or the negative dataset is considered to be predicted by a method if (i) the
predicted sequence is included in the query sequence, (ii) the query se-
quence is included in the predicted sequence or (iii) at least 70% of the
nucleotides in the query sequence are covered by the predicted sequence.
True-positive predictions (TP) are deﬁned as the number of sequences in
the positive dataset predicted by a method; true-negative predictions (TN)
correspond to the number of sequences in the negative dataset that are
not predicted by a method; false-positive predictions (FP) correspond to
the number of sequences in the negative dataset that are predicted by a
method; and false-negative predictions (FN) is the number of sequences
in the positive dataset that are not predicted by a method. Sensitivity is
deﬁned as the proportion of sequences in the positive dataset that are
predicted by a method [Sn; Equation (1)], whereas speciﬁcity [Sp;
Equation (2)] corresponds to the proportion of sequences in the negative
dataset that were not predicted by a method.

2.5 Identiﬁcation of optimal aggregation of methods

To optimally aggregate methods and their corresponding predictions of
sRNAs, we implemented an efﬁcient multiobjective evolutionary algo-
rithm relying on the NSGA-II algorithm (see Supplementary Material).
Optimal aggregations are deﬁned as those that maximize two objectives:
Sp and Sn. To prevent data overﬁtting and bloat (Deb et al., 2002), we
applied the following constrains to select speciﬁc aggregations of meth-
ods: (i) if two aggregation of methods have the same Sp and Sn, the one

with the lower number of basic methods is preferred, and (ii) a basic
method might only appear one time in each aggregation of methods.

2.6 Combination of aggregations of methods in a simple
majority voting multiclassiﬁer

We combined the optimal aggregations of methods by using a majority
voting strategy (Supplementary Fig. S4). This strategy was selected be-
cause of its simplicity, high level of accuracy and robustness (Belaid and
Anigbogu, 1994; Lam and Suen, 1997; Rahman et al., 2002). The voting
procedure is implemented as follows: given n independent experts having
the same probability of being correct (in our case, aggregations of meth-
ods), and that each of these experts produces a decision regarding the
identity of an unknown observation, then the observation is assigned to
the class that achieves the highest levels of consensus. To avoid possible
sampling biases, we performed 10-fold cross-validation in the training set
composed of 193 SLT2 positive sequences. This positive dataset was ran-
domly partitioned into 10 subsets of 20 sequences each. In each round of
cross-validation, one set was retained as the validation data for testing the
model, and 173 sequences in the remaining 9 subsets are used as training
data. The cross-validation process was then repeated 10 times
(Supplementary Fig. S5). The Sp and Sn were averaged over the 10-
fold cross-validations and reported. The same procedure was carried
out for the negative dataset.

2.7 Testing the multiclassiﬁer performance by predicting
sRNAs in S.meliloti and in a multispecies dataset

To test our method with sRNAs that have not been included in our
original training set, we created a new dataset of experimentally validated
sRNAs similar to that developed for SLT2 but from the phylo genetically
distant Alphaproteobacteria S.meliloti (Supplementary Table S3). This
dataset is composed of 81 sRNAs obtained by deep-sequencing tech-
niques (Schliiuter et al., 2010) and other individually validated sequences
(del Val et al., 2007; Ulvé et al., 2007; Venkova—Canova et al., 2004).
Pairwise and multiple alignments were obtained analogously to those
from SLT2 using BLAST and T-COFFEE (Altschul et al., 1990;
Notredame et al., 2000), respectively. The performance of our method
was also evaluated with a wide variety of organisms by using a multi-
species dataset (Lu et al., 2011), which was previously used in predicting
sRNAs. This dataset is composed of 776 putative sRNAs from 14 differ-
ent genomes including Helicobacter pylori, Staphylococcus aureus,
Bacillus subtilis, Listeria monocytogenes, Chlamydia trachomatis,
Shewanella oneidensis, Xenorhabdus nematophila, Vibrio cholerae, E.c0li,
SLT2, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Caulobacter crescentus, Burkhola’eria cen-
ocepacia and Streptomyces coelicolor A3. The sRNAs in this dataset were
obtained by experimental validation (Huang et al., 2009; Sittka et al.,
2008), genome-tiling microarray experiments (Toledo-Arana et al.,
2009) and RNA-seq experiments (Albrecht et al., 2010; Liu et al., 2009;
Lu et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2010; Sittka et al., 2008; Yoder—Himes
et al., 2009).

3 RESULTS

We applied the basic methods (Supplementary Table S1) and the
proposed methodology (Fig. 1) to identify sRNAs in the positive
and negative SLT2 datasets of sRNAs (see Section 2). Then, we
predicted sRNAs in a new dataset of experimentally validated
sRNAs (del Val et al., 2007; Venkova-Canova et al., 2004; Ulvé
et al., 2007) from S.melil0ti, as well as in a multispecies dataset
(Lu et al., 2011) (see Section 2).

3.1 Basic methods identify sRNAs with disparate
sensitivity and speciﬁcity

We applied seven basic methods including zMFold, vsFold,
QRNA, Alifoldz, dynalign, MSARi and RNAz2
(Supplementary Table S1) to identify sRNAs. These methods
constitute the state-of—the-art in the ﬁeld and implement diverse
methodologies that embrace the most relevant features that char-
acterize sRNAs. The performance of the basic methods was esti-
mated according to their Sp and Sn by scoring the sequences/
alignments from the positive and negative SLT2 training data-
sets. The obtained results reveal that these methods tend to favor
either Sp or Sn, but not both of them simultaneously (Table 1).
For example, RNAz2 (Sp 0.98, Sn 0.27) exhibits high Sp but low
Sn, whereas zMFold (Sp 0.49, Sn 0.90) does the opposite.
QRNA achieves the best trade-off between both Sp and Sn.
We found that most of the sRNAs are predicted by more than
two basic methods (Supplementary Fig. S6). A large group of
sRNAs is predicted by just one method (55 sequences) but with
low Sp, whereas only a small group of sequences is not predicted
by any of the methods (8 sequences; Supplementary Fig. S6).
These differences in terms of Sp and Sn exhibited by the basic
methods—trained mainly with S.enterica Thyphimurium and
E.c0li—raise the question if their combination could be success-
fully applicable to other genomes.

3.2 The proposed strategy identiﬁes optimal aggregations
of basic methods that predict sRNAs

The basic methods showed different and sometimes opposing Sp
and Sn values when predicting sRNAs (Table 1). This may be
due to their speciﬁc methodological approaches that tend to em-
phasize particular features that characterize sRNAs but not
others. To address this problem, we incorporated and combined
the particular skills of each basic predictor and eliminated their
contradictory information. To combine the most promising char-
acteristics of basic methods, we run all basic methods over the
training dataset (i.e. SLT2 dataset) and searched for optimal
aggregations of these methods. The aggregations are performed
by combining basic methods using the union —U— and the inter-
section —ﬂ— operations (Halmos, 1961) on their predictions at the
nucleotide level (Supplementary Fig. S3). These typical mathem-
atical set operations have their parallel logic operations (i.e. OR
and AND), which consecutive application allows deﬁning any

possible logic expression. The potential aggregation of methods
(here >20 000) creates a large space of potential hypotheses,
which can be represented as a lattice (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Each aggregation in the lattice can be considered as a new pre-
diction method.

The union of methods increases Sn and decreases Sp, whereas
the intersection does the opposite, as expected. Then, the com-
bination of union and intersection operations in the same aggre-
gation may increase Sp and Sn simultaneously. However, the
aggregation of all methods does not necessarily ensure more
accurate predictions (Cordon et al., 2002). For instance, two
methods may have contradictory predictive strategies, or even
more, the simple summation of them can lead to overﬁtting
(Cordon et al., 2002; Harari et al., 2010; Zwir et al., 2005).
Moreover, the computational complexity of performing an ex-
haustive search of all logical expressions (i.e. Boolean satisﬁabil-
ity problem) is of complexity NP-complete (Gu et al., 1996).
Therefore, a careful optimization strategy is required to integrate
the basic methods in an appropriate fashion.

To address the computational complexity described above,
our methodology applies a heuristic approach consisting in the
generation of optimal aggregations by using multiobjective opti-
mization techniques; particularly, we used the genetic algorithm
NSGA-II (Supplementary Material) that simultaneously search
for trade-off solutions between two objectives (i.e. Sp and Sn).
Because there are two possibly contradictory objectives to be
optimized simultaneously, there is no single optimal solution
but rather a family of optimal results (Table 2). These results
are organized as a Pareto optimal front (Supplementary Fig. S5).
This front includes all non-dominated solutions (Deb, 2001;
Ruspini and Zwir, 2002), where one solution is said to dominate
another solution when it is better than the other in all objectives
being considered (e.g. both sensitivity and speciﬁcity).

3.2.1 Optimal aggregations of basic methods enhance their speci-
ficity and sensitivity for identifying sRNAs We identiﬁed 26 dif-
ferent optimal aggregations based on the SLT2 dataset that
correspond to non-dominated solutions (Table 2 and
Supplementary Fig. S7). For example, both aggregations
AGR_14 (Sp 0.79, Sn 0.66) and AGR_26 (Sp 0.33, Sn 0.98)
are in the Pareto front of optimal solutions because the ﬁrst
has better Sp values but worst Sn values than the second. Of
all these aggregations, the ones with the best possible trade-offs
among the selected objectives normally lie on the ‘knee’ of the
Pareto front (Deb, 2001) (Supplementary Fig. S4). All 26 aggre-
gations dominate the basic methods based on the Sp and Sn
objectives, and thus none of the latter solutions are in the optimal
Pareto front (Supplementary Fig. S4). The methods szold and
RNAz2 are always present in aggregations achieving the best Sn
scores (Sn > 0.93), and their corresponding Sp scores are between
0.33 and 0.49 [e.g. (((zMFold U QRNA) U Alifoldz) U RNAz2);
((RNAz2 U zMFold) U dynalign)]. The aggregations harboring
the best Sp scores (Sp>0.93) are mainly composed of at least
one intersection of basic methods harboring high Sn combined
with the union of methods displaying high Sp [e.g. ((QRNA ﬂ
RNAz2) U MSARi); ((((vsFold U Alifoldz) ﬂ (QRNA ﬂ
zMFold)) U RNAz2) U MSARi)], and their Sn scores stand be-
tween 0.25 and 0.49. Finally, there is not obvious pattern in the
most balanced aggregations (i.e. Sp and Sn ca. 0.7).

3.3 Incorporation of all optimal aggregations in
a multiclassiﬁer establishes a robust and
accurate predictor of sRNAs

Our strategy assembles all optimal aggregations of methods in a
multiclassiﬁer, which is a decision-making method that considers
all of these solutions in a cooperative strategy toward identifying
sRNAs (see Section 2). Here, the cooperation policy was imple-
mented as a simple majority voting approach of all non-
dominated aggregations, which guarantees robust predictions
(Supplementary Fig. S4). First, we tested the performance of
the multiclassiﬁer with respect to the SLT2 training dataset, ob-
taining 0.78 and 0.67 averaged scores of Sp and Sn, respectively
(Table 2). To account for the sample variability, we performed a
10-fold cross-validation on the same SLT2 training dataset
(Supplementary Fig. S5 and Supplementary Tables S4—S7), ob-
taining 0.81 and 0.61 averaged scores of Sp and Sn, respectively.
Remarkably, the average of the nine partitions used as training
sets along the 10-folds exhibited 0.83 and 0.62 averaged scores of
Sp and Sn, respectively. The similar training and test across the
cross-validation process exhibits the robustness and stability
characteristics of the multiclassiﬁer implemented in our method-
ology. At least four classes of aggregations identify distinct
subsets of sRNAs (Supplementary Fig. S7). One class of aggre-
gations recognizes most of the sRNAs with high Sn but relatively
low Sp scores (Table 2; AGR_21 to AGR_26). In contrast,

another class of aggregations recognizes only a single subset of
sRNAs with high Sp but low Sn (Table 2; AGR_l to AGR_9).
Most of the other aggregations recognize a large subset of
sRNAs (Table 2). Notably, the majority voting strategy imple-
mented in our methodology allows preserving the trade-offs be-
tween these classes in the prediction process, which is consistent
with the criteria used for the selection of aggregations in the
Pareto front. Other approaches like predicting by the
Maximum Sn or Sp may provide better but less robust results.

Then, we tested the performance of the multiclassiﬁer on an-
other dataset of sRNA examples that were not included in the
previous SLT2 training set. As in the case of the SLT2 dataset,
we compiled a new dataset 81 experimentally validated sRNAs in
the well-studied but phylogenetically distant bacterium S.melil0ti
(see Section 2; Supplementary Table S3). The multiclassiﬁer
based on 26 aggregations obtained 0.72 and 0.58 scores of Sp
and Sn, respectively (Table 3), whereas the best basic method for
this dataset (szold) showed 0.44 and 0.67 scores of Sp and Sn,
respectively (Table 4). Because the Sp and Sn scores obtained by
our methodology are not signiﬁcantly different from those ob-
tained with the SLT2 training dataset, the obtained results con-
ﬁrm that the proposed strategy is sufﬁciently robust to make
accurate predictions even under different nucleotide composition
of the target genome.

We also compared the performance of our methodology with
that of the SIPHT method (Livny et al., 2006), which is widely

used by the scientiﬁc community. This method uses the QRNA
basic method combined with other computational tools that
identify and annotate sequence-based motifs of transcription
factor binding sites and rho-independent terminators. Because
the SIPHT method uses genomic features for its predictions of
sRNAs, our database of negative examples cannot be used for
comparison purposes because the motifs of these features are
likely to be destroyed in shufﬂed sequences (see Section 2).
Therefore, the Sp score cannot be fairly estimated.
Consequently, we compared our methodology with SIPHT in
terms of Sn. The predictions of SIPHT for SLT2 and S.melil0ti
were obtained from (http://newbio.cs.wisc.edu/sRNA/). We pre-
dict sRNAs with 0.67 and 0.57 averaged scores of Sn in SLT2
and in S.melil0ti, respectively. In comparison, SIPHT predicts
the sRNAs contained in our SLT2 and in S.melil0ti databases
of positive examples with 0.46 and 0.33 scores of Sn, respectively.
We also tested the predictive power of our approach with an-
other dataset composed of sRNAs derived from 14 different gen-
omes (Lu et al., 2011) (see Section 2), which also were not
contained in the training set. We signiﬁcantly overcame the
basic methods used by (Lu et al., 2011) in all genomes independ-
ently of their GC content, except for Burkholderia and Chlamydia
(Lu et al., 2011). The best performing individual methods in (Lu
et al., 2011) obtained 0.27, 0.20, 0.40 and 0.49 of Sn in the dif-
ferent datasets, while our methodology obtained an average of
0.70 Sn across all datasets (Supplementary Table S8).
Remarkably, these values were similar in SLT2 and S.melil0ti.

4 DISCUSSION

The use of next-generation technologies, such as RNA-seq,
demonstrated that the number and diversity of sRNAs is greater
than was originally expected (Toledo-Arana et al., 2009; Vogel,
2009). Therefore, there is increased interest in identifying sRNAs
and deciphering their role in regulatory systems within a particu-
lar species or across multiple species. These experimental meth-
ods are critical for functional characterization of sRNAs (Sittka
et al., 2009); however, their applicability still has been con-
strained to a relatively small number of sRNAs as well as gen-
omes. Consequently, computational prediction of sRNAs is
required to develop new hypothesis that allows focusing the
experimental veriﬁcation on particular targets, to provide clues
about the molecular mechanisms governing gene regulation.
Different strategies have been implemented using distinct com-
putational methods to predict sRNAs (Livny et al., 2008; Rivas
and Eddy, 2001; Washietl et al., 2005); however, most of them
exhibit similar limitations. Essentially, there is a trend in these
computational methods to favor either Sp or Sn, but not both, in
their predictions (Lu et al., 2011) and that, in turn, generates
either a high number of false-positive predictions or false-nega-
tive predictions. This is true even if some methods combine in
one predictor different sRNA features and/or genomic informa-
tion (Livny et al., 2005, 2008). In this work, we presented a new
methodology, which identiﬁes bacterial sRNAs by simultan-
eously minimizing the false-positive predictions (Sp) and maxi-
mizing the number of recognized sRNAs (Sn). This method is

able to predict sRNAs in different genomes, even when there is a
lack of reliable annotations, because it does not rely on add-
itional genomic features.

Several characteristics distinguish our methodology from
other methods. The proposed approach uses the distinctive fea-
tures of different methods—termed basic methods—instead of
developing a new method de nava, and combines them in a
manner that resolves the problem of contradictory knowledge
and thus improving their predictive power. To do that, our meth-
odology combines the predictions of the basic methods by using
typical set theory operations such as the union and/or intersec-
tion. Likewise in logic expressions, the systematic application of
these operations produces chained and disparate aggregations of
methods. Because not all aggregations may perform better than
an individual method (del Val et al., 2007), and large aggrega-
tions including all methods may also produce overﬁtting, our
methodology selects optimal aggregations as a trade-off between
Sp and Sn by using multiobjective optimization heuristic tech-
niques. Particularly, we used the genetic algorithms NSGA-II.
The efﬁcient heuristics used by our methodology avoids intract-
able processing times, which are common in combinatorial opti-
mization (De Smet and Marchal, 2010). This process results in
non-redundant optimal aggregations, where the balance between
the two contradictory objectives also prevents overﬁtting
(Cordon et al., 2002; Romero-Zaliz et al., 2009). This approach
substantially improves both Sp and Sn over that of previous
single aggregation of two predeﬁned methods (Livny et al.,
2008; Pichon and Felden, 2003).

We applied our methodology to a dataset of experimentally
validated sRNAs in SLT2. The results are signiﬁcantly better
than those results from the basic methods alone (Tables 1 and
2) in training or test datasets (Supplementary Fig. S3s and
Supplementary Tables S4—S7). Remarkably, the Sp and Sn
scores are similar between both training and test sets, and even
within the training test fold partitions performed in the cross-
validation. These results strongly suggest that the method is
robust for predicting sRNAs despite the possible sample variabil-
ity. To effectively conﬁrm these ﬁndings, we tested the predictive
power of the method in two datasets that were not used in the
training process: the S.melil0ti and the multispecies datasets.
Despite the different nucleotide composition of these genomes
(see GC content; Supplementary Table S8), our methodology
obtained good Sp and Sn scores. Finally, our proposed

method obtained better Sn scores than SIPHT (Livny et al.,
2008), a widely used method that uses speciﬁc genomic informa-
tion about binding sites and terminators (Li et al., 2012). Unlike
our method that uses general characteristics of sRNAs, SIPHT
uses particular genomic features. Therefore, the database of
negative examples based on shufﬂed sequences cannot be fairly
used to estimate comparable Sps for both methods. It would be
interesting to derive negative examples acceptable to both meth-
ods to better compare their power.

In sum, our approach has demonstrated to encode a successful
and robust methodology to predict sRNAs even in poorly anno-
tated genomes. Moreover, we have shown that appropriately
combining results from existing methods in a meta-analysis-like
approach may signiﬁcantly improve their accuracy and facilitates
the generation of new predictors by simply using different train-
ing datasets and/or aggregating new basic methods.

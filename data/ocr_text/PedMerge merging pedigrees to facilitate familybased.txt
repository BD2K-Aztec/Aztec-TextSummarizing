ABSTRACT

Summary: PedMerge allows users to accurately and efficiently
merge separately ascertained pedigrees that belong to the same
extended family. In addition to validation checks of pedigree
structure, the software provides files in LINKAGE or PEDSYS format
that easily allow to be used by a variety of genetic statistical software
packages including LINKAGE, SOLAR, SLINK or can be further
manipulated with Mega2.

1 INTRODUCTION

To investigate the genetic background of a disease or other traits,
a variety of genetic statistical software has been developed (Stein
and Elston, 2009). The development of this type of analytical
software has been phenomenal. However, researchers continue to
have to manage a variety of complex, time-consuming tasks to
prepare data for these analyses, indicating that the development of
data management software has not kept up with that of analytical
tools. For example, data management of extended families remains
still tedious, especially when pedigree ascertainment is ongoing,
pedigree structure continues to change and interim analyses need to
be performed. Additionally, ﬁeldwork may demand a more ﬂexible
handling of pedigree data when, e.g. families are large and include
multiple and/or consanguineous marriages/matings.

To date, this kind of merging can only be performed in a
restricted way. For example, the pedigree drawing program Progeny
allows merging of pedigrees in the drawings. However, pedigrees
with multiple and/or consanguineous marriages/matings can have
complex Visual presentations. Merging them in this way may not be
easy and error prone (e.g. linking false individuals). No summary
report of the merge is provided, thus making it difﬁcult to document
and quality-control the development of a pedigree. The pedigree
drawing programs Cyrillic and Pedigree-Draw cannot perform such
a merge at all.

PedMerge ﬁlls in this gap. It supports pedigree management in any
stage of ﬁeldwork and data management without any restrictions

on size, number of marriages/matings or consanguinity loops.
It therefore can be used for pedigree management in (i) human
genetics and (ii) animal breeding projects (see, examples below),
as well as (iii) pedigree projects investigating, e. g. inbreeding loads
and evolutionary potentials of (endangered) wild animal populations
(Pemberton, 2008).

2 FEATURES

PedMerge provides a text-based, menu-driven interface. To invoke
a merge the user needs to (i) specify two input ﬁles, (ii) select
the format of the pedigree output ﬁle and (iii) specify whether to
keep (default) additional information in the pedigree output ﬁle.
Before merging it validates the pedigree structures and performs
completeness and consistency checks.

2.1 Input ﬁles and options

PedMerge needs two input ﬁles. One ﬁle provides the pedigree
structure of the sub-pedigrees and is in pre-Makeped LINKAGE
format (Terwillger and Ott, 1994). Other data including phenotypes
and genotypes can be included or excluded in the merge according
to the user’s preference.

The second input ﬁle contains information about the ‘key—
individuals’, i.e. individuals that occur in two or more sub-pedigrees
and are the components connecting them. A key-individual can be
a spouse in one sub-pedigree and a child in another one and/or has
multiple mates. The program allows an unlimited number of key-
indiViduals in a family. The number and size of sub-pedigrees to be
merged are also unlimited.

2.2 Output ﬁles

The user can choose to obtain a pedigree output ﬁle in pre-Makeped
LINKAGE format or a Master ﬁle for PEDSYS, a database to manage
pedigrees that is freely available from the Southwest Foundation
for Biomedical Research (San Antonio, TX, USA). Optional, these
two output ﬁles can contain additional information, e. g. phenotypic
or genotypic data. If necessary, these output ﬁles can be further
managed with MegaZ (Mukhopadhyay et al., 2005). A log ﬁle is
provided that (i) reports the ﬁndings of the various validations
checks, and (ii) summarizes the merge and assignment of new
pedigree and individual IDs to allow the tracking of the entire
merging process.

PedMerge

 

2.3 Implementation

Pedmerge is written in C# and interactively runs on versions of
Windows but also on Linux and Mac OS X .We successfully ran it
on the last two operating systems by using Mono, an open source
implementation of Microsoft’s .NET Framework that allows cross
platform development (http://www.mono-project.com).

Detailed documentation of the software, how to set it up and
example input ﬁles for testing are available on our website.

3 EXAMPLES OF APPLICATION

(I ) CANHR Study: PedMerge simpliﬁes and accelerates pedigree
management for repeated analyses while ascertainment is ongoing.
We performed variance component analyses and power evaluations
with SOLAR (Almasy and Blangero, 1998) for a genetic obesity
project at CANHR (Boyer et al., 2005; Plaetke et al., 2006). Family
ascertainment was ongoing and performed with Progeny. After
each ﬁeld Visit, several pedigree structures had changed because
of recruitment of additional relatives and/or merging of separate
pedigrees that had been found to be related. Additional merging with
PedMerge was then performed. For the ﬁnal analysis, 26 partially
modiﬁed sub-pedigrees consisting of 507 participants were merged
with PedMerge to one pedigree consisting of 986 individuals.

(II) Alaskan Husky Dog Study: Convenient and fast data
preparation when pedigree structures are provided in diﬁ‘erent
formats. Our current ascertainment of extended pedigrees for a
behavior genetics study in Alaskan Husky dogs provides several
challenges that can be managed more easily with PedMerge.
(i) Pedigrees from kennels have been separately ascertained;
ascertainment is ongoing. Controlled mating between dogs from
different kennels can produce pedigrees that are related among
kennels. (ii) Owners track their breeding efforts by collecting
pedigree information themselves and using different approaches. In
this case, we directly obtain from them their pedigree descriptions.

For example, one kennel provided basic information (i.e. name,
sex, birth date) of each dog and its parents. Constructing these
pedigrees was straight forward. We entered the data of these nuclear
pedigrees, determined the key-individuals and applied PedMerge. In
this case, data entry was done within 1.5 h. PedMerge needed less
than a second to merge 19 pedigrees consisting of 89 individuals to
ﬁnally obtain four merged pedigrees with a total of 70 dogs.

From another kennel we obtained four— generation ‘upside-down’
pedigrees, each showing the names of an individual currently
in the kennel, its siblings belonging to the same litter, parents,
two grandparents and four great-grand parents. For PedMerge, we
generated the input ﬁles and checked data of nuclear two or three
generation pedigrees within 3 h. The merging of these 27 pedigrees
(Fig. 1A) consisting of 142 dogs to one large pedigree of 102
individuals lasted less than a second. We performed a second merge
‘by hand’ that needed 12h. It included multiple checking of data
but no data entry for further analysis. Because of multiple matings
among dogs, two Visual presentations were necessary to detect key-
indiViduals, perform the manual merge and assign the new individual
IDs (Fig. 1).

information of their dogs.

of merged pedigree showing matings and key-individuals. If a child is a key-
individual, it is connected to its parents by a dashed line. Numbers show
which pedigree in (A) belongs to a mating. For example, mating 24—18—4
shows that these dogs mated three times and had 3 litters. New IDs for the
individuals in the merged pedigree was given by simultaneously working
through pedigrees in (A) and (B).

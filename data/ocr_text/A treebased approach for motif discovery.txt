ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pattern discovery algorithms are widely used for the
analysis of DNA and protein sequences. Most algorithms have
been designed to find overrepresented motifs in sparse datasets
of long sequences, and ignore most positional information. We
introduce an algorithm optimized to exploit spatial information in
sparse-but-populous datasets.

Results: Our algorithm Tree-based Weighted-Position Pattern
Discovery and Classification (T-WPPDC) supports both unsupervised
pattern discovery and supervised sequence classification.
It identifies positionally enriched patterns using the Kullback—
Leibler distance between foreground and background sequences
at each position. This spatial information is used to discover
positionally important patterns. T-WPPDC then uses a scoring
function to discriminate different biological classes. We validated
T-WPPDC on an important biological problem: prediction of single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from flanking sequence. We
evaluated 672 separate experiments on 120 datasets derived from
multiple species. T-WPPDC outperformed other pattern discovery
methods and was comparable to the supervised machine learning
algorithms. The algorithm is computationally efficient and largely
insensitive to dataset size. It allows arbitrary parameterization and
is embarrassingly parallelizable.

Conclusions: T-WPPDC is a minimally parameterized algorithm for
both pattern discovery and sequence classification that directly
incorporates positional information. We use it to confirm the
predictability of 8NPs from flanking sequence, and show that
positional information is a key to this biological problem.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pattern discovery algorithms have been widely used in
bioinformatics to analyze recurrent groups of symbols, such

as DNA and protein sequences. Existing methods can be divided
into two classes based on their underlying approach: probabilistic
versus deterministic. Probabilistic methods maximize the likelihood
between a motif pattern model and a background pattern model.
Gibbs sampling and its variants are the prototypical probabilistic
methods (Bailey and Elkan, 1995; Lawrence et al., 1993). Some
deterministic methods construct candidate patterns from a given
pattern length and alphabet size [e. g. Oligo—Analysis/Dyad—Analysis
(van Helden et al., 2000) and YMF (Sinha and Tompa, 2003)], some
enumerate possible patterns from given sequences [e.g. MOPAC
(Ganesh et al., 2003)], while others use tree structures [e. g. Weeder
(Pevesi et al., 2004)] or other mathematical approaches [e.g.
Projection (Buhler and Tompa, 2002)]. Despite this methodological
diversity, there are three issues not well—addressed by the existing
algorithms.

First, positional variability in sequences is typically ignored.
Most widely used pattern discovery methods focus on ﬁnding
high—frequency sequences independent of their location, primarily
representing patterns with position—speciﬁc scoring matrices (Sinha
and Tompa, 2003) or Markov models (Thijs et al., 2002). However,
these techniques assume equal occurrence probabilities at all
positions within a sequence. This assumption does not hold for many
biological datasets (Bimey et al., 2007). A recent method Amadeus
uses a localization score to estimate whether the occurrences of the
motif tend to cluster at speciﬁc distance from the transcription start
site (Linhart et al., 2008); however, they focused on the speciﬁc
distance or a range of sequences, not all the positions of each
sequences. Second, it is unclear how to handle the numerous, low—
information content motifs that occur in biological datasets. The
presence of such motifs is a major reason for the low accuracy
of current pattern discovery methods (Linhart et al., 2008; Tompa
et al., 2005). Third, current algorithms focus on analyzing sparse
datasets comprising a small number of long sequences. The advent
of next—generation genome sequencing has led to much populous,
short—sequence data.

To address these issues, we developed a new pattern
discovery algorithm called Tree—based Weighted—Position Pattern
Discovery and Classiﬁcation (T—WPPDC). T—WPPDC ﬁrst applies
Kullback—Leibler distance between foreground and background
sequences to determine a weight for each sequence position.
It next integrates this spatial data to discover positionally important
patterns. Such patterns are used to classify sequences. Moreover,
the tree structure used by T—WPPDC allows handling of different

pattern lengths, sequence lengths and alphabet sizes. In addition,
the algorithm is embarrassingly parallel. Another tree structure
method, Weeder (Pevesi et al., 2004), applies a sufﬁx tree to spell
the sequences. Our method differs from Weeder since trees in
T—WPPDC do not only hold the possible candidate of motifs, but
also the positional weights. Furthermore, our method is used for
classiﬁcation.

We tested T—WPPDC on an important biological problem:
predicting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). SNPs are single
base pair variations in the genome, and are likely the most common
form of genetic variation. On average, 1 out of every 1000 bp may
be SNPs (Schafer and Hawkins, 1997). The function of most SNPs
remains unclear; especially those not associated with changes in
protein sequence. Genome—wide linkage analyses have implicated a
large number of SNPs in disorders ranging from Crohn’s disease
(Vilani et al., 2009) to cancer (Houlston et al., 2008) and to
quantitative traits such as height (Suzuki et al., 2009). Many groups
are attempting to predict the functional effects of individual SNPs
(Li et al., 2010; Ribas et al., 2006), and this problem has grown in
importance with the advent of cheap genome—sequencing (Hudson
et al., 2010).

In contrast, less research has focused on the causes of SNPs: why
do they occur where they do? Zhao studied two SNPs databases such
as Celera’s CgsSNP and RefSNP and found that natural selection
inﬂuences patterns of genome variations (Zhao et al., 2003). Another
study described a map with 1.42 million SNPs and showed that SNPs
have been historically passed on across generations (S achidanandam
et al., 2001). However, recent study has discovered the effect
sequence position (Zhang and Zhao, 2004) and our previous work
also characterized sequence—based determinants of SNPs (Yan et al.,
2007). Surprisingly, we were able to predict SNPs from ﬂanking
sequences alone using machine—learning methods. Pattern discovery
methods failed at this task, with near—chance prediction accuracies
(Yan et al., 2007).

To further examine this question, we tested T—WPPDC on the
DNA sequences ﬂanking known SNPs. Information is unevenly
distributed in these sequences, with many motifs showing
positional bias. Moreover, some biological factors such as natural
selection, non—uniform experimentation and stochasticity interfere
with sequence—based SNP analysis. T—WPPDC is able to select
informative motifs despite these factors and shows superior
performance relative to existing pattern discovery methods.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Datasets

We evaluated SNP datasets from different species: (i) human chromosomes
21 and 22 and (ii) human and mouse chromosome X (which have a
high degree of synteny). Both SNP datasets were generated as described
previously (Yan et al., 2007), with minor modiﬁcations. Repeat—masked
human genome sequence (build hg18), and mouse genome sequences (mm8)
and SNP annotations were downloaded from the University of California,
Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser database (Karolchik et al., 2003) and
dbSNP build126 for human and mouse. The SNP sequence is combined with
equal length of 5/ and 3/ ﬂanking sequence from chromosomes 21 and 22
for human, chromosome X for human and mouse, parsed by a Perl script
(v5.8.8). We create a negative control sequence for each SNP by randomly
selecting a base of the same reference allele from the same chromosome.
To avoid SNPs under strong selection, we applied four criteria to both

positive and negative sequences: ﬁrst, SNPs within 5000 bp of any known
exon (RefSeq annotation of February 8, 2007) were excluded. Second, SNPs
with discordant UCSC and dbSNP allelic annotations were excluded. Third,
non—SNP polymorphisms (e. g. indels) and SNPs with unknown strandedness
were excluded. Fourth, SNPs with ambiguous or repeat—masked bases in
their 5/ or 3/ ﬂanking regions were excluded. These criteria removed
two—thirds of SNPs. For each of the 12 SNP alleles, our dataset contains
equal numbers of true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN). It is possible
that some randomly selected negative controls are novel polymorphisms but
this contamination is predicted to be under 0.1% (Yan et al., 2007). For
method evaluation, we divided each allelic dataset into equal—sized training
and testing groups. Combined, there are 120 datasets are used, 72 datasets
for chromosome 21 and 22 with symmetrical ﬂanking sequences of 50, 100
and 150 bp (12 alleles >< training/testing x 3 ﬂanking lengths) and 48 datasets
for chromosome X ( 12 alleles >< training/testing x 2 species), which leads to
672 experiments (72 x 4 pattern lengths +48 x 2 cross—species x 4 pattern
lengths). Our ﬁnal chromosomes 21 and 22 human datasets contain
50 bp sequences (average number of sequences :I: SD: 5435 :I:4114), 100 bp
sequences (4939:I:3750) and 150 bp sequences (4518:I:3434). Our ﬁnal
chromosome X datasets contain 50 bp sequences with 4188 :I: 2703 for human
and 9461 :I:6465 for mouse (shown in Supplementary Table 81).

2.2 Tree-based weighted position pattern discovery and
classiﬁcation (T-WPPDC)

T—WPPDC is designed to combine positional information and a novel scoring
system to identify maximally predictive patterns. It uses a tree structure to
greatly reduce algorithmic complexity. First, Tree Construction builds trees
from training sequences. Each node of the tree holds a value representing the
likelihood of a given pattern at a given sequence position. Second, T—WPPDC
calculates the Kullback—Leibler (K —L) Distance (Kullback, 1987; Kullback
and Leibler, 1951) for each tree to measure positional differences. Third, Leaf
Selection introduces a new scoring system that identiﬁes high information
content patterns to handle the low—signal motifs. Fourth, T—WPPDC scans
through each test sequence and performs Sequence Classiﬁcation.

Here are the notations used in this section: T—WPPDC requires two sets
of sequences, foreground and background. To simplify the description, we
use class A as foreground and B as background in this section. Letters N
and L represent sequence number and length, respectively. We study DNA
sequences, therefore, the alphabet is M e {A,C,G,T} and number of letters in
the alphabet M is 4. As with most pattern discovery methods, the length of
a pattern P, called K, must be ﬁxed prior to analysis. We use l to describe a
particular sequence, and lowercase letters, i and j represent a position within
a particular sequence.

2.2.1 Tree construction T—WPPDC ﬁrst constructs trees for the two
sequence classes A and B. We scan all patterns with a K —width window
from [0, L—1] in all sequences and use patterns at the i—th position construct
tree—A(i) and tree—B(i). Therefore, for the training class A sequences, we built
Forest—A of (L —K + 1) A—trees.

Tree Construction Rules:

0 A node of a tree i has M children.

0 A child has exactly one parent.

0 Each child corresponds to an element of M.

0 A node holds an alphabet, score V, and a pointer to its child.

0 The depth of tree is the pattern length K.

0 There are L —K +1 trees in each Forest.

0 Tree—size depends on M (alphabet size) and K (pattern length).

One can generate a j—bp pattern by traversing the tree from the root node
to the node at depth j (Supplementary Fig. 81). The score in each node at
depth K, as shown LRA (PK, i) in Formula 1, represents how likely this K —bp
pattern P is to be found at position i in class A. Identical patterns in different

trees may have different score. This process is repeated identically on class
B to build Forest—B with (L —K + 1) B—trees.

2.2.2 Kullback—Leibler distance T—WPPDC uses Kullback—Leibler
distance (K—L distance) to measure positional difference between class
A and B. The K—L distance usually measures the distance from a true
probability distribution p to a target probability distribution q (Kullback,
1987; Kullback and Leibler, 1951), but can also be viewed as the
information content between two distributions. KL(A,-,B,-) is the distance
between distributions A and B at position i (0 5 i 5L):

IMI
KL(AiaBi)= Z Ai,m10g(Ai,m/Bi,m) (2)
m=1

where Al-am (or Bl-3m) represents the probability of alphabet m shows at
position i in classA (or B). Because K—L distance is asymmetric, KL(A,-,B,-) 75
KL(B,-,A,-). The distance of each corresponding position i between A and B,
KLD(i), can be deﬁned as the sum of the KL(A,-,B,-) and KL(B,-,A,-). Each
position in the sequence has an individual KLD, giving L distinct KLD
weights. As above, we multiply the log frequency value (Formula 1) by
KLD for each node at class A:

net): i LRA(PK.i) x KLD(i+K) (3)
K21

where VA(i, j) represents the node value at depth j for tree i in class A.
The same process is repeated identically on each node on class B. In other
words, the value at each node is the sum of its parents and its own weighted
value. These weighted values are the product of the normalized log frequency
ratio and the K—L distance. Intuitively, summing the parent weighted scores
reﬂects the inﬂuence of neighboring positions. The weighted value for a
node at depth j for tree i reﬂects the likelihood that this j—bp pattern occurs at
position i. Therefore, each leaf node collects the sum of all its ancestors and
every node in a tree hold values reﬂecting the likelihood that a speciﬁc
pattern occurs at this position. This design allows handling of arbitrary
pattern lengths.

2.2.3 Leaf selection As noted above, some patterns with low information
simply reﬂect noise in the dataset and do not aid in discrimination.
T—WPPDC is designed to select high signal patterns. Filtering based
on signal strength trades sensitivity for increased speciﬁcity. The
difference between corresponding leaf nodes from Forest—A and Forest—B
(i.e. VA(i, j) — VB(i , j) > 6) shows how well the pattern distinguishes A from B.
If this difference is positive, then it is overrepresented in class A. The larger
this difference, the more informative a pattern is. By altering e we can change
the sensitivity—speciﬁcity trade—off. Theoretically, 620 and should be set
small enough to determine the optimal performance. Performance varies with
different values of e and T—WPPDC deﬁnes 6 with n equally spaced points
in the range [VA(i,j)—VB(i,j)], shown in Formula 4. To optimize 6, one
can preset n and choose the local/global optimal performance accordingly.
When 6 is zero leaf selection is disabled, meaning that all leaves are used
for classiﬁcation.

2.2.4 Sequence classiﬁcation As in the training procedure, a K—width
window is applied to a test sequence, l. The matching pattern at each position
is selected from Forest—A and Forest—B. A ﬁnal score, A(l), is calculated as
the sum of all K —bp patterns in l, as below in Formula 5. Patterns that do
not meet the leaf selection threshold, 6, will not contribute. This process is
repeated on Forest—B to generate B(l). The sequence l then is classiﬁed to
the class with the larger score. The detailed workﬂow is shown in Figure 1.

and testing. During the training phase, it builds weighted trees from training
sequences sets A and B. Each sequence set has L—K + 1 trees (called
Forest—A and Forest—B, respectively), and each tree corresponds to the
patterns at a speciﬁc sequence position. Leaf selection chooses patterns that
satisfy the criteria [i.e. VA (i , j) — VB(i , j) > e] for further classiﬁcation. During
the testing phase, each K —bp pattern from a test sequence l is evaluated for
the matching patterns from trees in Forest—A. A ﬁnal score A(l) is calculated
from Formula 5. The process is repeated to generate B(l). Sequence l is then
classiﬁed to a class A(or B) with a larger ﬁnal score A(l) [or B(l)].

2.3 Implementation

Assuming it takes a unit time t1 to construct a single tree, T—WPPDC
requires (L —K + 1) x t1 to construct each Forest. Updating nodes with K—L
distance therefore requires (L—K + 1) xtz, assuming t2 time per tree for
updating. Leaf selections can be combined with sequence classiﬁcation,
involving matching patterns from testing sequence to the trees, which
requires logK comparisons per pattern, leading to N x (L—K + 1) xlogK
comparisons. Therefore, the computation complexity of T—WPPDC is
a polynomial function, O(Nx(L—K)><logK) [i.e. Nx(L—K)><logK+
(L —K) = (L —K) x (N logK + 1)]. T—WPPDC loads the Forests into memory,
with (L —K + 1) trees. Each tree size depends on the alphabet number M and
the depth of trees K, |M lK , giving space requirements of O(L >< |M|K).

Tree structure design provides ﬂexibility. It is easy to adapt to different
alphabets or sequence and pattern lengths. As noted above, each tree holds
patterns starting at one sequence position. The current implementation
handles DNA sequences (lM | =4). Running time is unaffected by different
alphabets, while total memory usage is a function of alphabet size.

To further reduce running time and memory requirements, T—WPPDC
can be distributed to multiple nodes for parallel computing. As trees
are independent from one another, each can be distributed to a separate
computing node for simultaneous K—L distance calculation, leaf selection
and classiﬁcation. Thus, parallel memory requirements are only O(lMlK),
and computation complexity reduces to O(NlogK).

T—WPPDC was implemented in C++ with the STL—like template tree class
(http://www.aei.mpg.de/~peekas/tree/). While we expect it to be platform
independent, we have only tested it under RedHat Linux (v2.6.24) and
compiled with GCC (v4.2.4). To evaluate computational performance in a
consistent way, we ran all pattern discovery algorithms on a single system.

2.4 Related work

Recently, two other groups have described approaches to incorporate
positional information into pattern discovery. The ﬁrst group developed a
probabilistic method that incorporates positional information into priors for
Multiple Em for Motif Elicitation (MEME) analysis (PSP—MEME), which

they tested on 156 yeast ChIP—chip datasets (Bailey et al., 2010). The
second group developed an approach called LocalMotif that applies three
scoring schemes (Narang et al., 2010). Both PSP—MEME and LocalMotif
require prior information on the motif, with PSP—MEME assuming OOPS
(one motif per sequence) or ZOOPS models (zero or one motif per
sequence) and not supporting ANR models (arbitrary number of motifs
per sequence). LocalMotif requires the number of motifs to output, the
number of candidates and the weights for three scoring schemes. Most of
these parameters are unknown and must be estimated. Moreover, LocalMotif
involves an exhaustive enumeration strategy, causing exponential complexity
with pattern length, while T—WPPDC has polynomial complexity with pattern
length (K), O(N ><(L—K)><logK). Aside from these algorithmic details,
T—WPPDC is the only one of these techniques that can do both motif
discovery and sequence classiﬁcation.

2.5 Pattern discovery analyses

To evaluate the performance of T—WPPDC, we used three publicly available
pattern discovery methods: BioProspector (version. 2004) (Liu et al., 2001)
and Oligo (downloaded on September 21, 2007) (van Helden et al., 2000) and
LocalMotif (Narang et al., 2010). We ran each method (including T—WPPDC)
using default parameter settings. Oligo returned all possible motifs for
analysis (n: |M|K). We ranked the motifs by Z—score and selected the top
20 overrepresented (or underrepresented) motifs. The value 20 was selected
to allow these methods to slightly exceed the number of motifs identiﬁed by
BioProspector.

First, BioProspector, Oligo and LocalMotif were run separately on the
foreground (true positive, TP) and background (true negative, TN) datasets.
BioProspector and LocalMotif returns both consensus motifs and position
weight matrices; Oligo only returns consensus motifs. Second, motifs from
Oligo found identically in the TP and TN sets were excluded. Third, a
Perl script (v5.8.7) was used to scan through each test sequence for motifs
found only in the TP or TN training datasets. If a motif occurred exactly
in the test sequence one or more times, then the sequence was predicted to
have the same class (SNP or non—SNP) as the motif. Fourth, the actual and
predicted classes for all test sequences were used to generate two—way tables
giving the number of TPs, TNs, false—positives (FPs) and false—negatives
(FNs). Fifth, overall accuracy was calculated from this two—way table in the
standard way [i.e. (TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)]. Sixth, these steps were
repeated with inversion of the testing and training datasets. Seventh, position
weight matrices from BioProspector and LocalMotif were analyzed by using
logistic regression analysis (Wasserman and Fickett, 1998). Finally, the entire
procedure was repeated separately for each pattern discovery algorithm for
sequence lengths of 50, 100 and 150 bp and pattern lengths in [3,6] for
Oligo and LocalMotif and [4,6] for BioProspector (BioProspector has a
minimum pattern length of 4 bp). The pattern discovery methods were run on
two Linux GNU 2.6.15—29 64—bit servers with identical hardware/software
conﬁguration, and compiled with GCC (v4.0.3). Logistic regression analysis
was run using Weka (v3—6—2).

2.6 Machine-learning analyses

Two machine—learning algorithms were employed for comparison: Random
Forests (RF) and K—nearest neighbors (KNN). These methods are well—
established, minimally parameterized techniques representative of diverse
ﬁelds of machine learning. RF is a non—metric classiﬁcation technique
(Breiman, 2001) that uses an ensemble of decision trees. KNN is a
standard non—parametric classiﬁcation method (Duda et al., 2001). Machine—
learning analyses were performed largely as described previously (Yan et al.,
2007). Each base of ﬂanking sequence was expanded into four predictor
variables, one for each nucleotide, and was assigned a binary value from the
sequence. Machine—learning methods were implemented in the R statistical
environment (v2.5.1) with RandomForests in the RandomForest package
(v4.5—18) and KNN in the class package (v7.2—36). RF contained 1000 trees

and K was set to 51 for KNN analysis, based on our previous analysis (Yan
et al., 2007).

2.7 Data visualization and statistical analyses

All plots and statistical analyses were generated in the R statistical
environment (v2.11.1) using the lattice (v0.19—11) and latticeExtra (v0.6— 14)
packages. To evaluate the relationship between SNP position and weight
w, we employed Spearman’s rank—order correlation using the absolute
value of the position as Spearman’s correlation has minimal assumptions:
(i) two variables are ordinal, interval or ratio; and (ii) there is a
monotonic relationship between variables. As such, it can be used as
a non—parametric test. Statistical analysis of differences in means was
determined using unpaired, two—tailed Wilcoxon signed—rank test, due
to its minimal assumptions: (i) the differences of two observations are
assumed to be independent; and (ii) directional comparisons can be given.
Both these assumptions are met in the datasets used here. To improve
visualization, weights were scaled for plotting as: wscaledzw—min(w).
Similarly, information content values were scaled as: ICscaled=03 ><
[logzllCl—min(log2|IC|)] (0.3 is chosen for better visualization). These
operations are monotonic and only alter the centering of the distributions.
Pattern discovery methods CPU running time was loess—smoothed with a
span of 0.2 (0.2 is chosen for the best smoothing ﬁt).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Distribution of the K—L distance

Our previous work showed that classiﬁcation methods greatly
outperform pattern discovery algorithms in predicting SNPs from
ﬂanking sequences (Yan et al., 2007). Machine—learning methods
can incorporate positional information, and so to assess the
importance of this factor, we performed an information content
analysis. For all SNPs that met our stringent inclusion criteria
(Section 2.1), we extracted 50 bp of ﬂanking sequence centered
on the SNP. We selected an equal number of 50 bp sequences
ﬂanking non—SNP positions on the same chromosomes. For each
position and for each of the 12 SNP alleles, we calculated the mutual
information as:

Ab
ICpos = ZbAb 1082 B—b (6)

Here I? is the nucleotide base {A,C,G,T} and Ab (Bb) is the frequency
of base I? at the current position from sequence A (or B). In our
analysis, we set sequence set A as the TPs and B as the TNs. Figure 2
shows that positions close to the SNP (position 0) are generally more
informative than those further away. However, some positions that
are quite distal to the SNP itself carry information.

To incorporate this information directly into pattern discovery,
we developed T—WPPDC, which uses the K—L distance (Kullback,
1987; Kullback and Leibler, 1951). K—L distance captures positional
dependency in information content (Supplementary Fig. S2). For
most (10/ 12) alleles, the distance of a position to the SNP
is proportional to the K—L distance (i.e. Spearman’s rank—order
correlation is signiﬁcant, P<0.05). This holds true for ﬂanking
sequences of 50, 100 and 150 bp from human chromosomes 21,
22 and X.

As noted above, each leaf node holds a value that represents the
likelihood that a speciﬁc pattern occurs at this position. As shown
in Figure 3, the Foreground scores come from the leaf values from
Forest—A (representing the Foreground class) and Background scores
are from the leaf values of Forest—B (representing the Background
class) (Fig. 3). Symmetric scores indicate little difference between

motifs from foreground and those from background. Most SNPs
have symmetric score distributions except C/T and G/A SNPs (see
Supplementary Figs 3—5), which shows that the C/T and G/A are
more different from background. This might explain the better
prediction performance of C/T and G/A alleles that is discussed
below.

3.2 Prediction accuracy

T—WPPDC was evaluated by selecting half of each dataset for
training and half for testing/validation. The training and testing
datasets were then inverted and the procedure repeated (i.e. 2—fold
cross—validation). We used sequences of lengths 50, 100 and 150 bp
for SNPs from human chromosomes 21, 22 and X. We also
performed four species—speciﬁc tests: Hs—Hs (train and test on
human sequences), Mm—Mm (train and test on mouse sequences),
Hs—Mm (train on human sequences and test on mouse sequences) and
Mm—Hs (train on mouse sequences and test on human sequences).
We used four different pattern lengths of 3—6 bp. In total, we
conducted 672 experiments: 288 experiments on chromosome 21/22
and 384 experiments on chromosome X. We focus on overall
prediction accuracy [(TP+TN)/(TP+TN+FP+FN)], but report
multiple metrics (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3).

T—WPPDC with leaf selection off consistently outperforms
existing pattern discovery methods. First, the overall
prediction accuracy is 55.5 :I:3.6% when threshold 6:0

(Fig. 4 for chromosome 21/22 and Supplementary Fig. S6
for chromosome X). This is a statistically signiﬁcant improvement
over Oligo, BioProspector and LocalMotif (Oligo: 50.0:I:0.8%,
P=5.61><10_81; BioProspector: 50.8:I:0.9%, P: 1.46 x1042;
LocalMotif: 51.3:I:1.2%, P=1.39><10_70). We are unable to
detect a difference between T—WPPDC in this nai've mode and
KNN, a fully supervised method (54.9:I:2.9%, P=0.61), but
remains lower than that of RF (58.9:I:3.8%, P=2.66 X 10‘4).

These modest prediction accuracies suggest that not all SNPs are
predicable because of non—sequence factors like natural selection.
To demonstrate this, we exploited the fact that not all patterns carry
equivalent information. Patterns with similar frequencies in TP and
TN cases are mostly noise and have little independent predictive
capacity. Enabling leaf selection helps to removes these patterns.
The performance varies with threshold stringency (i.e. 6 value), so
we executed T—WPPDC at 20 equally spaced point (i.e. n=20 in
Formula 4) (Fig. 5). We chose the last point prior to any decline as
the optimum position. Leaf—selection improves median accuracy, at
the expense of increased SDs. In this mode, it classiﬁes ~40% of
sequences (Supplementary Fig. S7) and outperforms KNN on the
Chromosome X (P=2.00 X 10‘3) and RF on Chromosome 21/22
(P = 0.05) datasets. T—WPPDC with leaf selection also is statistically
indistinguishable from performance of KNN in the Chromosome
21/22 datasets (P=0.24) and RF in Chromosome X (P=0.69)
datasets. We note that these analyses are not precisely comparable as
we did not exploit the potential of RF or KNN to prioritize sequences
based on vote numbers.

Fig. 4. Accuracy comparisons across all methods. (Data: chromosome
21/22) A boxplot of algorithms evaluated in this study (from left to right:
pattern discovery method—OLIGO, BIO, LocalMotif, classiﬁcation method—
KNN, T—WPPDC with leaf selection off option, RF). The y—axis is the overall
prediction accuracy [(TP+TN)/(TP+TN +FP+FN)], ranging from 0.47 to
0.67. T—WPPDC with leaf selection off includes all the patterns for prediction.
A P—value is calculated by Wilcoxon signed—rank test, unpaired, two sided
(OLIGO, Oligo; BIO, BioProspector; LocalMotif, LocalMotif).

To determine if prediction accuracy is a function of dataset
characteristics, we analyzed sequence length, pattern length, SNP
allele and species (Fig. 6). Shorter sequence (Fig. 6A) and pattern
lengths (Fig. 6B) perform better than longer ones. For example,
patterns with 3 bp perform on average 12% better than those
with 6bp long. More datasets should be examined in the future
to explicitly test this observation. In all datasets, the C/T and
G/A alleles have the best prediction accuracy (15—16% better
than the overall median performance, P=8.68 X 10‘9 for C/T and
P=1.98X10_9 for G/A, Fig. 6C), reﬂecting the powerful (and
known) inﬂuence of the bases immediately adjacent to the SNP
for these alleles. We also noticed that interspecies performance is
signiﬁcantly better than the cross—species test (P 22.77 X 10‘11 for
Hs species test, mean accuracy for Hs—Hs: 61.0%, Hs—Mm: 58.6%;
and P=4.82 X 10‘9 for Mm species test, mean accuracy for Mm—
Mm: 62.4%, Mm—Hs: 56.8%, Fig. 6D), which suggests that patterns
are partially conserved across species.

3.3 CPU performance

TWPPDC is an efﬁcient algorithm with O(N XL X logK) running
time. Of our 672 experiments, 95% ﬁnished within 2 min on a Linux
GNU 2.6.15—29—AMD64 server with Intel® Xeon® x5355 2.66 GHc
CPUs and 16 GB RAM. T—WPPDC runs, on average, 39.7%
faster than Oligo (P=0.01) and 46.5% faster than BioProspector
(P = 1.33 X 10‘“). Figure 7 demonstrates that T—WPPDC is able to
provide a lower bound of CPU running time (solid line), suggesting
it is less sensitive to data size.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

4.1 Conclusions

We have developed a new pattern discovery algorithm, T—WPPDC,
which identiﬁes positional biases between two classes of sequences.
We optimized search processes with tree structures, which
dynamically improve the computation complexity and allow
superior parallelization. By incorporating the pattern selection,
T—WPPDC is able to reach the optimal classiﬁcation performance.

Total Sequence {hp}

Fig. 7. CPU analysis versus total sequence (in base pair). CPU time
(in seconds) as a function of the total amount of sequence in each dataset
(in base pair). Each algorithm is plotted in different shapes, representing
individual datasets and loess—derived lines of best—ﬁts are plotted with a
span of 0.2.

It was designed to perform well for large datasets and especially
those with relatively short position size. Such datasets are
increasingly common, given the high resolution of next—generation
sequencing.

Our previous work demonstrated the possibility of SNP prediction
from ﬂanking DNA (Yan et al., 2007), but indicated that the
presence/absence of speciﬁc short patterns was not predictive.
Here, we demonstrate that integrating positional and frequency data
improves SNP prediction accuracy, superior to the best pattern—
discovery algorithms and comparable to the best machine learning
methods tested. Compared to the existing methods, T—WPPDC
requires no prior information of motifs and are capable of performing
both discovery and classiﬁcation efﬁciently [O(N X L X logK)].

Our work also suggested that not all SNP sequences are
predicable. Some are more dominated by the nature selection and
random chance, while others can be predicated by short patterns.
For example, C/T and G/A SNPs can reach 79% median prediction
accuracy while T/A SNP can only receive 53% median accuracy.
Furthermore, T—WPPDC is an efﬁcient and ﬂexible method that can
be adapted to other sequences and parallel computing systems.

4.2 Future work

T—WPPDC is a ﬂexible and effective algorithm. Current design
supports variable pattern length, sequence length and alphabets.
Future expansions can focus on three main areas. First, the algorithm
is embarrassingly parallel, so a parallel implementation would be
advantageous. Second, the binary classiﬁer can be extended to
many groups. Third, T—WPPDC currently assumes exact positional
conservation and many overlook patterns with high information
content but weak or fuzzy positional conservation. Future work
will expand T—WPPDC to search for positional conservation in
moving windows and/or to use fuzzy motif matching. Finally, it is
possible that T—WPPDC provides a way of assessing the importance
of positional information in speciﬁc datasets.

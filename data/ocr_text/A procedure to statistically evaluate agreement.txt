ABSTRACT

Motivation: Animal models play a pivotal role in translation
biomedical research. The scientific value of an animal model depends
on how accurately it mimics the human disease. In principle,
microarrays collect the necessary data to evaluate the transcriptomic
fidelity of an animal model in terms of the similarity of expression with
the human disease. However, statistical methods for this purpose are
lacking.

Results: We develop the agreement of differential expression
(AGDEX) procedure to measure and determine the statistical
significance of the similarity of the results of two experiments that
measure differential expression across two groups. AGDEX defines
a metric of agreement and determines statistical significance by
permutation of each experiment’s group labels. Additionally, AGDEX
performs a comprehensive permutation-based analysis of differential
expression for each experiment, including gene-set analyses and
meta-analytic integration of results across studies. As an example,
we show how AGDEX was recently used to evaluate the similarity of
the transcriptome of a novel model of the brain tumor ependymoma
in mice to that of a subtype of the human disease. This result,
combined with other observations, helped us to infer the cell of origin
of this devastating human cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microarray technology has enabled researchers to simultaneously
measure the expression of thousands of genes in a biological
tissue specimen. These data are commonly used to compare gene
expression among biological conditions within the same species.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

For example, the experiments may compare the transcriptomes of
tumors and host normal tissue or between tumors arising in the
same tissue. However, translating this wealth of data into other
experimental systems has proven difﬁcult because of limitations in
comparing transcriptome data generated with different microarray
platforms or from different species.

Here, we present a statistically rigorous procedure (called
AGDEX for agreement of differential expression) to combine
transcriptome information across two experiments that compare
expression across two biological conditions. Each experiment
may utilize different microarray platforms or even study different
species. The AGDEX procedure determines whether the differential
expression proﬁle of one experiment has statistically signiﬁcant
similarity to that of the other experiment. In our studies, we used
AGDEX analysis results and other experimental data to validate a
novel mouse model of a human brain tumor. We have successfully
used AGDEX for this purpose in published studies of ependymoma
(Johnson et al., 2010) and medulloblastoma (Gibson et al., 2010)
to identify the cell of origin for each of these two brain cancers.
We describe the method in detail and illustrate it with our analysis
of the data from our ependymoma study.

2 METHODS

The AGDEX procedure enables investigators to perform a rigorous and
comprehensive analysis of data from a pair of experiments that each
compares expression across two biological conditions. In total, the AGDEX
procedure performs the following analyses:

(1) identify individual genes that are differentially expressed in each
experiment;
(2) identify gene—sets that are differentially expressed in each experiment;

(3) meta—analytically integrate results across experiments to identify
differentially expressed genes;

(4) meta—analytically integrate results across experiments to identify
differentially expressed gene—sets; and

(5) characterize and determine the statistical signiﬁcance of similarities
of differential expression proﬁles across the two experiments for the
entire transcriptome and for speciﬁc gene—sets.

Below, we provide details for how AGDEX performs each of these analyses.

Agreement of differential expression for cross-species genomics

 

2.1 Differential expression of individual probe-sets for
one experiment

Suppose an array measures the expression of j = 1, ...,m probe—sets for each
of g: 1,2 groups deﬁned by distinct biological conditions. Now, for each
probe—set j, deﬁne

dj =56 1 j —562j (1)
as the difference between the average 921 j log—signal for group 1 and the
average fez]- for group 2. Let d = {(11, ...,dm} be the vector of dj for all probe—
sets j.

For each probe—set j, compute a P—value for dj by permutation of the
group labels (Good, 2010; Gadbury et al., 2003). Let b = 1, ...,B index a set of
permutations of assignment of the group labels to the arrays. For 19 = 1, ...,B,
let djb be the value of (1) obtained by permutation b of the group labels. For
each dj, the permutation P—value is the proportion of permuted group labels
that yield an absolute value of (1) than does the original assignment of group
labels. Mathematically, the P—value for dj is given by

1 B
P(dj)= 5210de 2 ldjol) (2)
[2:]

where djo is the value of  computed using the original group assignments,
and I(') is the indicator function that equals 1 if the enclosed statement is
true and equals 0 otherwise. In practice, all possible permutations are used
whenever it is computationally feasible to do so. Otherwise, a large number
of randomly selected permutations are utilized. In some applications, the
permutations should be restricted to preserve important stratiﬁcation features
of the experimental design.

2.2 Differential expression of gene-sets for one
experiment

Suppose the probe—sets are annotated according to membership in a gene—set
5. Leth =1,...,ms index the ms probe—sets that belong to gene—set s. The
gene—set differential expression statistic

1 ms
1:. = E Z Idj.l (3)

Sjs=1

is the average of the absolute value of the differential expression statistics
of probe—sets belonging to gene—set s.

The statistic deﬁned in (3) is a function only of the data of genes that
belong to the gene—set and thus is self—contained by Goeman and Bijhlmann’s
(2007) deﬁnition. Goeman and Bijhlmann’s (2007) show that self—contained
gene—set testing procedures have greater statistical power than competitive
testing procedures that compare the differential expression results of genes
belonging to a gene—set to those of genes that do not belong to a gene—set.

A P—value for it, may be determined by permutation of the group labels
(Barry et al., 2005). Let b = 1, ...,B index a set of permutations of the group
labels. Let hso be the value of (3) obtained using the original group labels.
Also, let hsb be the value (3) obtained by permutation b=1,...,B. The
permutation P—value

1 B
Pam: 5210mm 2 lhsol) (4)
[2:1

is the proportion of permuted assignments of labels that yield a greater
value of (3) than does the original assignment of labels. The same set
of permutations is used to compute P—values for each of the differential
expression statistics for individual probe—sets and each gene—set.

2.3 Meta-analytic integration of probe-set results

Now, suppose that data have been collected in two experiments that perform
biologically analogous comparisons of expression across two biological
conditions. Additionally, suppose that we wish to perform a meta—analysis

that combines the analysis results to identify differentially expressed probe—
sets. Without loss of generality, assume that the probe—sets from each study
have been matched and ordered so that the index j: 1, ...,m corresponds
to the probe—sets that query the same gene in both studies. Let dlj and d2]-
represent the vectors differential expression statistics computed for probe—set
j in the analysis of data from studies 1 and 2, respectively. Also, let P(d1j)
and P(d2j) be the P—values computed from 31 and 32 permutations for each
study, respectively.

Now, deﬁne

Z d . = ' d . (1)—1 1_L

where CID—10 is the quantile function of the standard normal distribution.
Note that the deﬁnitions for the z—statistics incorporate information about
the direction (sign) and signiﬁcance (P—value) of differential expression
from each study and include a correction for discrete permutation P—values
by adding 0.5 to the numerator and adding 1 to the denominator of the
fraction. If the null hypothesis is true for both studies, then the P—values
are approximately uniform. Thus, the z—statistics are independent and each
z—statistic approximately follows a standard normal distribution. Therefore,
Z (d 11-) +Z (dzj) is approximately normal with mean 0 and variance 2. Stouffer
et 01., (1949) show that a meta—analysis P—value is then

Z(d1j)+Z(d2j)
where CM) is the cumulative distribution function of the standard normal

2.4 Meta-analytic integration of gene-set results

Now, suppose that (3) has been used to compute statistics hls and hzs and
their corresponding P—values P0213) and P0225) for differential expression
analysis of gene—set s for study 1 and study 2. Deﬁne

B P h 0.5

and B P h 05
Z(h2s)=<l>_1(1——2 (23H ' )

as z—statistic that characterize the statistical signiﬁcance of ins and hzs,
respectively. Recall that in, :0 and kg, :0 by deﬁnition (3). If the null
hypothesis is true for both studies, then Z(hls)+Z(h25) approximately
follows a normal distribution with mean 0 and variance 2. Therefore,

Z(h1s)+Z(h2s))
#2

is a meta—analysis P—value for the gene—set analysis that combines the analysis
results from the two studies.

P(h1s,h2s)=1— <1>(

2.5 Agreement of differential expression

Now we describe how AGDEX evaluates the agreement of differential
expression among probe—sets that belong to a gene—set s and evaluate its
statistical signiﬁcance by permutation. Again, suppose that data has been
collected for two studies that each compare expression across two groups.
For simplicity of notation, assume in this section that the data have already
been limited to probe—sets that are members of gene—set s and that the order
of these probe—sets has been matched across the two studies. Let js = 1, . . . , ms
index the probe—sets. For simplicity of notation, the subscripts will be omitted
from js and ms in this section. For each probe—set j, let dlj and dzj be the
values of (1) from study 1 and study 2, respectively. Let d1 = {d1j,...,d1m}
and d2={d2j,...,d2m}.

The AGDEX procedure uses two statistics to measure the agreement of
d1 and d2. The ﬁrst statistic is the cosine of the angle between d1 and d2 in
multivariate space (Fitzpatrick, 1996), i.e.

d1-d2
COS(d1,d2)= —
||d1|| >< ||d2||
Zﬁldrjdzj (5)

#2721613) (23-11%)

The second statistic is the difference of proportions (dop). Formally, the
second statistic is deﬁned as

 

 

1 m ,
dop(d1,d2)= ; ZSlgn(d1jd2j)
j=1
m (6)
1 . .
= ; Zsrgn(d1j)s1gn(d2j)
j=1

which is the difference between the proportion of probe—sets that show
agreement and the proportion that show disagreement in the direction
of differential expression. Both statistics have range [—1,+1] with +1
indicating the greatest agreement of differential expression results and —1
indicating the greatest disagreement of differential expression results.

A P—value can be computed for each statistic by permutation of the group
labels for either study. Let go be the value of the cosine or dop statistic
obtained from the original assignment of group labels in both studies. Let
u=1,...,31 index permutations of the group labels from study 1 and let
v: 1, ...,32 index permutations of the group labels from study 2. Let d 1 u be
the vector of differential expression statistics obtained from permutation u
of the group labels of Study 1. For each u, let all“ be computed using d 1,,
and the observed d2. Thus,

Br
1
P1(610)=B—1 E 1(Ia1ulzlaol) (7)
14:1

is a P—value obtained by permutation of the group labels in study 1. This
P—value compares the observed value no of the agreement statistic to the
distribution of agreement statistics obtained under the null hypothesis that
there is no differential expression in Experiment 1.

Similarly, for each v, let dzv be the vector of differential expression
statistics obtained by permutation v of group labels for Study 2. Also, deﬁne
azv as the value of the agreement statistic obtained using dzv. This yields

32
1
P2(00)=B—ZI(|02VI Zlaol) (8)
2 v=1
as a P—value for do based on permutation of group assignments for Study 2.

2.6 Statistical Properties

For each study 5 = 1,2 and each probe—set j = 1, . . . , m, let the expected value
of the differential expression statistic be E(dsj)=85j. Also, let 81 and 82
be the vectors of true difference between means for Experiments 1 and 2,
respectively. Recall that d 1 and d2 are independent because they are estimated
from datasets collected in separate studies. Therefore,

E(d1-d2)= ZE(d1jd2j)
j=1

’" (9)
=2E<d1j)E(d2,-)

j=1
231.32

and thus the expected value of the numerator of the cosine statistic in (5) is
zero if d1 and d2 are orthogonal. Similarly, the expected value of the dop

statistic in (6) is zero if sign(d1) and sign(d2) are orthogonal. In the speciﬁc
orthogonal case, none of the genes with differential expression in Study 1
are differentially expressed in Study 2 (821- =0 for each j with 811-750), the
expected value of the dop statistic is 0 and the expected value of the cosine
statistic is approximately zero. Consequently, for analyses with this type of
orthogonal diﬁerential expression, the P—values are not likely to be signiﬁcant
because they compare the absolute value of the observed statistic to that of
statistics obtained by permutation.

In non—orthogonal cases, the probability of a signiﬁcant result increases
with sample size of each group in each study. As the sample sizes increase,
the variance of dsj decreases for each s and j and thus the variances of the
agreement statistics also decrease. The probability of a signiﬁcant result also
increases with the magnitude of

31 '32

A2— (10)
ll31||><||32||

for the cosine agreement statistic and with the magnitude of
A/zsign(81)-sign(82) (11)

for the dop statistic.

2.7 Statistical and biological interpretation

The statistical interpretation of AGDEX results must consider the magnitude
and sign of each agreement statistic and the sample sizes of each group in
each differential expression analysis comparison. Analyses with large sample
sizes may have power to detect some subtle but biologically uninteresting
agreements as statistically signiﬁcant. In such cases, AGDEX will give small
agreement statistics with small P—values. Conversely, analyses with small
sample sizes may not have sufﬁcient power to detect strong agreements
as statistically signiﬁcant. With very small sample sizes, it is impossible
for permutation procedures to give very small P—values. For example,
a 3 versus 3 comparison cannot yield a permutation P—value smaller than
1/ 10 (Gadbury et al., 2003; Pounds and Dyer 2008). In these cases, large
agreement statistics with moderate P—values may be of biological interest.
In some analyses, one comparison may have large sample size and the other
comparison may have a small sample size. In these analyses, one may wish
to focus attention on the P—values from permuting the labels of the study
with the larger sample size. In analyses where both comparisons have large
sample size, one may take the maximum of the four P—values (one P—value
for each of two agreement statistics by permutation of group labels from
each of two studies) to focus attention on the most robust results.

The biological interpretation of AGDEX results must consider that the
parameters A and A/ are functions of the differential expression status of
j=1,...,m genes for each of two studies that each compare expression
between two groups. A signiﬁcant result may be driven by a subset of
genes with statistically inﬂuential patterns of agreement. The genes with
statistically inﬂuential data may not have the greatest biological relevance.
Also, the P—values evaluate signiﬁcance against the null hypothesis that
there is no differential expression in the experiment for which the group
labels are permuted. Permutation simulates values of a test statistic under the
null hypothesis that group labels are random and arbitrary. Thus, signiﬁcant
agreement may not indicate biologically meaningful agreement. Therefore, a
signiﬁcant AGDEX result alone does not necessarily indicate that an animal
model accurately recapitulates the biologically important characteristics of
a human disease.

Nevertheless, a signiﬁcant AGDEX result can help direct additional
biological studies to more thoroughly evaluate the ﬁdelity of an animal
model. We used the AGDEX procedure to characterize the transcriptional
similarity of novel brain tumors in mice with a series of types of human brain
tumors. We found that one mouse tumor showed signiﬁcant transcriptomic
agreement with one subtype of human ependymoma (Johnson et al., 2010)
and another mouse model showed signiﬁcant transcriptomic agreement with
one subtype of human medulloblastoma (Gibson et al., 2010). AGDEX did
not ﬁnd signiﬁcant agreement with other human brain tumor subtypes. Thus,

Agreement of differential expression for cross-species genomics

 

we compared the histological characteristics of the mouse tumors to those of
their AGDEX—matched human tumors. In each case, the animal model and
human tumors showed striking histological similarities. The combination
of histological and transcriptomic evidence supports our assertion that
these animal models may be a useful resource for understanding the
biology of these tumors and performing preclinical evaluations of new
therapies.

2.8 Comparison with other procedures

The AGDEX procedure addresses a different biological question than other
methods proposed to evaluate the transcriptional similarity of a model system
(cell line or animal tissue) to a human tissue. Sandberg and Ernberg (2005)
and Zheng—Bradley et al., (2010) apply dimension reduction techniques
such as singular value decomposition or principal components analysis to
expression data matrices that include arrays from both the human tissues and
the model systems. The similarity of expression is measured by proximity
of the different systems’ samples in the lower dimensional space. These
methods are useful for describing similarities in a dataset that includes a
very diverse set of biological systems (multiple tissue types and multiple
species). However, these approaches do not formally evaluate statistical
signiﬁcance and their results depend on arbitrary user choices of tuning
parameters such as the number of dimensions in the reduced dataset. Poisson
and Ghosh (2007) propose a method to determine whether the proﬁle of
genes that differentiate between two model systems is useful for developing
a predictor of an outcome for humans. In contrast, AGDEX addresses the
speciﬁc biological question of whether the difference between tumor and
control in mice is similar to the difference between tumor and control in
humans.

2.9 Adaptive permutation to reduce computational
burden

Permutation testing is a computationally intensive procedure. We have
developed an adaptive permutation procedure that retains the statistical rigor
of permutation testing while greatly reducing its computational cost for
many genomics applications (Pounds et 01., 2011). Adaptive permutation
testing computes permutation statistics until observing a minimum of Bmin
permutation statistics that exceed the observed value of the test statistic or
until a maximum of Bmax permutation statistics have been computed. In this
way, the number of permutations B is a random variable with a truncated
negative binomial distribution. The success probability of the truncated
negative binomial distribution is the exact P—value 71’ based on all possible
permutations and the number of required successes is Bmin. The expected
number of permutations is approximately min(Bmax,Bmin)/Jr. The effect is
that a small number of permutations are performed for tests with large 71’
(and thus not of much interest) and a very large number of permutations are
performed to achieve the desired precision for tests with very small 11’. In
many genomics applications, adaptive permutation testing greatly reduces
the computational effort because most tests have insigniﬁcant P—values.

AGDEX allows users the option to utilize adaptive permutation to
compute the gene—set differential expression P—value of Section 2.2 and
the agreement of differential expression P—values of Section 2.5 for gene—
sets. For AGDEX, the adaptive permutation is modiﬁed so that at least Bmin
permutations yield extreme values for each of the 3 gene—set statistics: the
gene—set differential expression statistic in (3), the cosine agreement statistic
in (5) and the difference of proportions agreement statistic in (6).

3 RESULTS

As an example, we apply AGDEX to the data from our published
study of the expression of murine neural stem/progenitor cells,
murine brain tumors and the human brain tumor ependymoma
(Johnson et al., 2010). The Affymetrix 430v2 array was used to

proﬁle the expression of 45037 probe—sets for 13 brain tumors
from mice and a collection of 179 normal mouse stem cells.
Additionally, the Affymetrix U133+2 array was used to proﬁle
the expression of 54613 probe—sets for 83 human ependymoma
tumors. The human tumors were classiﬁed as belonging to the
novel subgroup ‘D’ or another subgroup. The expression data
were normalized with the MAS 5.0 algorithm. We downloaded
the 1454 biological process gene—set deﬁnitions from the gene—
set enrichment analysis website (www.broadinstitute.org/gsea) for
the U133+2 array. We used the Affymetrix best—match dataset
(available from www.affymetrix.com) to deﬁne 76061 pairs of
ortholog—matched probe—sets across the two arrays. We used the
best—match dataset to deﬁne the gene—sets for the mouse array probe—
sets. Adaptive permutation with Bmin = 100 and Bmax = 10000
was used to compute P—values for gene—set statistics. P—values for
individual probe—set statistics and the genome—wide dop and cosine
statistics were determined using 10000 permutations. Here, we
report statistical summaries of the results and refer readers to our
previous publication (Johnson et al., 2010) for more detailed results
and biological interpretations of the ﬁndings.

3.1 Differential expression analysis results

The methods described in Sections 2.1 and 2.2 were used to compare
the expression of the mouse tumors to the mouse stem cells.
The large sample size and biological distinctiveness of the tumor
provided exceptional statistical power for this comparison. A total of
18 974 probe—sets and 1452 gene—sets showed signiﬁcant differential
expression at the P = 0.0001 level.

We also compared the expression of the recently described
ependymoma subtype ‘D’ to that of other human ependymomas
because the ideal control of normal human brain stem cells
was not available. A total of 986 probe—sets and 419 gene—sets
showed signiﬁcant differential expression at the P=0.0001 level
(Supplementary Fig. 81).

3.2 Meta-analytic integration of differential expression
results

The methods of Sections 2.3 and 2.4 were used to meta—analytically
integrate the differential expression results obtained in Sections 3.1
and 3.2. A total of 1257 gene—sets and 12 560 ortholog—matched pairs
of probe—sets (among 76 061 pairs deﬁned by the best—match dataset)
showed signiﬁcant differential expression at the P = 0.0001 level.

3.3 Agreement of differential expression

Figure 1 plots the differential expression statistic for the mouse
comparison (x—axis) and human comparison (y—axis) for each of the
76 061 probe—set pairs. The paired differential expression statistics
give cos(d1,d2)=0.305 which is very signiﬁcant because only 18
of 10 000 permutations of the human group labels (P = 0.0018) and
51 of 10000 permutations of the mouse group labels (P = 0.0051)
yield Icos(d1,d2)l 20.305. Also, dop(d1,d2)=0.157 is statistically
signiﬁcant because only 82 of 10000 permutations of the human
group labels (P = 0.0082) and 118 of 10000 permutations of the
mouse group labels yield |dop(d1,d2)| 2 0.157. Thus, the agreement
of differential expression across the two experiments is signiﬁcantly
different from what may be expected if the human group labels are
randomly assigned and from what may be expected if the mouse
group labels are randomly assigned. This signiﬁcant transcriptomic

similarity prompted subsequent investigations which found that
the mouse model shared several microscopic and submicroscopic
cellular features with the human disease (Johnson et al., 2010).

We also computed the agreement statistics and P—values for each
gene—set. A total of 29 gene—sets had the robust result of showing
signiﬁcance at the P = 0.01 level in each of the four permutation tests
performed by computing each of two agreement statistics across
permutations of group labels for each of two agreement statistics
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.4 Computing time

This analysis was completed in 2.5h using R version 2.10.1 on
a desktop computer with 2.00GHz Intel Xeon CPU, 3.25 GB of
RAM and Windows XP. This is approximately an upper limit for
computing time for other applications with similar sample size
and number of probe—sets. Adaptive permutation computed a large
number of permutation statistics for most gene—sets in this example
with such highly signiﬁcant genome—wide agreement of differential
expression. In particular, the statistics were computed for Bmax =
10000 permutations of the mouse group labels for all gene—sets.
Also, the average number of permutations of human data for gene—
set analyses was 7784. In general, computing time for AGDEX will
increase with sample size, number of genes, number of gene—sets
and statistical signiﬁcance of the gene—sets.

3.5 Results using robust multichip averaging
normalization

We also applied AGDEX to data normalized by robust multichip
averaging (RMA; Irizarry et al., 2003). The results were similar
to those obtained using MAS 5.0 to normalize signal data
(Supplementary Table 81).

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed the agreement of differential expression
(AGDEX) procedure to integrate differential expression analysis
results across two experiments that may utilize different platforms

or even different species. The AGDEX procedure can be used
to examine the transcriptional ﬁdelity of animal models of
human disease by evaluating the similarities of transcriptome—wide
differential expression proﬁles across species. AGDEX may also
be used to integrate differential expression results that use different
platforms for the same species. In our studies, the AGDEX procedure
enabled us to conﬁrm the transcriptomic ﬁdelity of newly generated
mouse models and thereby infer the cell of origin of two distinct
human brain cancers (Gibson et al., 2010; Johnson et al., 2010).

The AGDEX procedure also performs a comprehensive and
statistically rigorous permutation—based analysis to address other
biologically important questions. For each experiment, the AGDEX
procedure performs differential expression analysis at the probe—set
and gene—set levels. Additionally, the AGDEX procedure meta—
analytically integrates differential expression results at the probe—
set and gene—set levels to improve statistical power to identify
genes or pathways that are important in one or both experiments.
Finally, the AGDEX procedure also evaluates similarity of
differential expression across the two experiments for predeﬁned
gene—sets.

The AGDEX procedure computes P—values by permuting
assignments of group labels within each experiment. Permutation is
computationally demanding but yet is critical to obtain an accurate
measure of statistical signiﬁcance, especially for identifying
differentially expressed gene—sets and evaluating the agreement of
differential expression. Some computationally simple approaches
for gene—set analyses utilize statistical models of chance that
inappropriately use ﬁnal results for genes as the unit of analysis.
For example, in our setting, one might use the binomial distribution
to model the number of ortholog pairs that have the same
sign for differential expression analysis in both experiments.
Such an approach grossly exaggerates statistical signiﬁcant by
inappropriately using the number of ortholog pairs as the “sample
size” and ignoring the correlation among genes. Permutation of
group labels preserves correlation among genes by keeping gene
expression values for each subject together during the random
reassignment, is explicitly linked to the experimental design and
uses the correct sample size by retaining the correct number of group
labels and expression data vectors (Allison et al., 2006; Barry et al.,
2005).

Nevertheless, the AGDEX procedure is computationally feasible.
Our example analysis was completed on a desktop computer in 2.5 h.
The sample size and number of genes and gene—sets are similar to
those of other contemporary applications. Additionally, utilization
of adaptive permutation will help reduce computational burden
by performing fewer permutations for gene—sets with insigniﬁcant
results (Pounds et al., 2011). This may be especially useful if the
more statistically robust and computationally demanding distance—
based statistic of Nettleton et al., (2008) for differential expression
analysis of gene—sets is incorporated into later versions of AGDEX.

The example analysis also shows that the AGDEX procedure and
our previously published results are robust against the strategy used
to select the ortholog pairs that are included in the analysis. In our
previously published study, the expression data were used to select
which ortholog pairs from the Affymetrix best match deﬁnitions
were retained for the AGDEX analysis. In this work, no such ﬁltering
was applied. The results of the analyses based on the cosine statistic
are qualitatively similar to the previously published ﬁndings. The
robustness of AGDEX results against ﬁltering of ortholog pairs is

Agreement of differential expression for cross-species genomics

 

concordant with earlier work that questions the merit of gene ﬁltering
in other contexts (Pounds and Cheng, 2005a).

Methodological extensions of AGDEX may enable researchers
to explore more complex and biologically interesting questions.
It would be interesting to generalize the procedure to handle
multiple two—group experiments or manage experiments that
examine differential expression across three or more groups.
Differential expression analysis may be generalized to an analysis
that examines the association of expression with one or more
phenotypes (Pounds et al., 2009b; Pounds et al., 2011). Additionally,
use of different metrics of agreement across two or more experiments
may improve statistical power to make meaningful biological
discoveries. These questions should be explored more thoroughly
in future research.

A number of statistical issues related to AGDEX should also
be explored. Normalization can have a profound impact on the
accuracy of copy number analysis of tumors (Mullighan et al., 2007;
Pounds et al., 2009a) and may have a substantial impact on the
analysis of expression data as well. Additionally, a fundamental
experimental design question is how to determine a large enough
sample size to ensure adequate statistical power (Pounds and Cheng,
2005b). Finally, the question of how to adjust for multiple testing
via control or estimation of the false discovery rate (Pounds, 2006)
for this type of analysis should also be explicitly addressed. The
AGDEX procedure performs multiple sets of related multiple tests
and thus introduces a challenge for estimating or controlling the
false discovery rate.

The bioinformatic issue of how to best match genes and gene—
sets across species for AGDEX should also be explored. The
results of the agreement analysis clearly depend on how accurately
genes and gene—sets are matched across species. In our study, we
matched genes and probe—sets across arrays using the Affymetrix
homolog dataset. We also used the Affymetrix homolog dataset
to deﬁne gene—sets for mice as those probe—sets that match genes
in human gene—sets. This Affymetrix homolog dataset is based on
the NCBI Homologene database, which is reasonable for many
applications. Nevertheless, the matching deﬁnitions in the NCBI
or any other homolog database depend on deﬁnitions, metrics and
thresholds for sequence similarity. Alternative deﬁnitions, metrics
or thresholds could impact the results of AGDEX and other
cross—species analyses.

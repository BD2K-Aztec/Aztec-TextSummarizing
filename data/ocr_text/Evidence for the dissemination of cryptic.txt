ABSTRACT

Motivation: Insertion of DNA segments is one mechanism by which
genomes evolve. The bulk of genomic segments are now known to be
transcribed into long and short non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs), promoter-
associated transcripts and enhancer-templated transcripts. These
various cryptic ncRNAs are thought to be dispersed in the human
and other genomes by retroposition.

Results: In this study, I report clear evidence for dissemination of
cryptic ncRNAs transcribed from intronic and intergenic segments
by retroposition. I used highly stringent conditions to find recently
retroposed ncRNAs that had a po|y(A) tract and were flanked by
target site duplication. I identified 73 instances of retroposition in the
human, mouse, and rat genomes (12, 36 and 25 instances, respect-
ively). The inserted segments, in some cases, served as a novel exon
or promoter for the associated gene, resulting in novel transcript
variants. Some disseminated sequences showed sequence conserva-
tion across animals, implying a possible regulatory role. My results
indicate that retroposition is one of the mechanisms for dispersion
of ncRNAs. I propose that these newly inserted segments may play
a role in genome evolution by potentially functioning as novel exons,
promoters or enhancers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Insertion of DNA segments into a genome is one of the mech-
anisms underlying genome evolution. Inserted DNAs include
genomic segments derived from other locations in the genome
(Linardopoulou et al., 2005), repetitive elements (Kim and Hahn,
2011), organellar chromosome fragments, such as nuclear mito-
chondrial DNAs (Richly and Leister, 2004), and retroviruses
(Doxiadis et al., 2008). Duplication of genomic segments is
common in eukaryotic genomes. These duplications are pro-
duced either by DNA-mediated or RNA-mediated mechanisms.
DNA-mediated duplication includes interchromosomal recom-
bination and tandem duplication by non-allelic homologous
recombination or non-homologous end-joining (Conrad and
Hurles, 2007).

Many DNA insertion events are mediated by a retroposition
mechanism, which involves transcription of genomic segments
into RNA molecules, reverse transcription of these RNAs to
cDNAs and insertion of the cDNA segments into new genomic
locations (Marques et al., 2005). Retroposition of RNAs of vari-
ous origins has contributed abundant innovations for genome
evolution (Brosius, 1999, 2003). The most common retroposed
DNA segments are retrotransposable elements, such as Alu,
SVA, Ll, MIR and endogenous retroviruses; the inserted seg-
ments can be exapted as novel exons for protein-coding genes
(Krull et al., 2007; Lev-Maor et al., 2003), act as alternative pro-
moters of nearby genes or induce de novo transcription (Kim and
Hahn, 2010, 201 1; van de Lagemaat et al., 2003) and contribute to
regulatory elements, such as enhancers (Nishihara et al., 2006).

Retroposition of fully or partially processed protein-coding
genes is a well-known mechanism for gene duplication, and
results in generation of either non-functional retropseudogenes
or functional retrocopies (retrogenes) of the original parental
genes (Baertsch et al., 2008; Marques et al., 2005). Functional
RNA molecules, such as small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs) and
small Cajal body-speciﬁc RNAs (scaRNAs), are also to be sub-
ject to retroposition and have been reported to generate novel
sno/scaRNAs during evolution (Schmitz et al., 2008; Vitali et al.,
2003; Weber, 2006; Zemann et al., 2006).

It is now known that the bulk of human and other eukaryotic
genomes, other than protein-coding genes or RNA genes, is tran-
scribed pervasively (Birney et al., 2007; Brosius, 2005; Jacquier,
2009; Salta and De Strooper, 2012). Although a lot of these tran-
scripts, which are collectively known as non-coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) or untranslated RNAs (utRNAs), were thought to
be simply transcriptional noise, some of them were reported to
play important roles in genome regulation (Berretta and
Morillon, 2009; Lakhotia, 2012; Wilusz et al., 2009). Enhancer
regions have been reported to be bidirectionally transcribed to
produce a distinct class of ncRNAs, enhancer-templated
ncRNAs or eRNAs, which are involved in transcriptional control
of nearby genes (Kim et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2011).

I hypothesized that various cryptic ncRNAs that were perva-
sively transcribed from intronic or intergenic segments would
be subject to retroposition. There are many genomic duplicons
that originated from intronic or intergenic regions in the human
and other genomes. However, it is difﬁcult to determine whether

these duplicons are generated by RNA-mediated retroposition or
DNA recombination mediated by non-homologous end-joining.
Retrogenes and retropseudogenes are easy to identify because
they usually lack introns compared with their source genes.
Retroposed intronic or intergenic segments, in contrast, would
not show any splicing features, but would still exhibit other sig-
natures of retroposition, namely, a poly(A) tract and target site
duplication (TSD).

In this study, I devised a bioinformatics procedure to identify
retroposed ncRNAs originating from intronic or intergenic seg-
ments in the human, mouse and rat genomes. The signature of
retroposition such as the poly(A) tract decays over time (Grandi
et al., 2013). Loss of the retroposition signature would make it
difﬁcult to judge whether a duplicon originated by retroposition
or DNA-mediated recombination. Therefore, in this study,
I used highly stringent conditions to detect only recently retro-
posed ncRNAs.

To collect clear evidence for retroposition of ncRNAs, I de-
signed a procedure to identify only recently retroposed segments
that retained the following retroposition signatures: (i) strong
sequence similarity between the source and the insert copies;
(ii) a poly(A) tract at the end of the insert; and (iii) a TSD at
both boundaries of the insert. By using these criteria, I identiﬁed
73 recent retroposition events of ncRNAs in the human, mouse
and rat genomes. Furthermore, I comprehensively explored and
discussed the impact of these retroposition events on nearby
genes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and bioinformatics tools

Genome sequences and bulk annotation data for the human (hg19), mouse
(m9) and rat (rn4) were downloaded from the University of California
Santa Cruz (UCSC) Genome Browser database (ftp://hgdownload.cse.
ucsc.edu) in July 2012. Additional annotation information was accessed
at the UCSC Genome Browser web server (http://genome.ucsc.edu)
(Kuhn et al., 2013). HOMER package version 3.16 (http://biowhat.ucsd.
edu/homer/) was used to annotate the source and the target regions (Heinz
et al., 2010). Pairwise alignments of DNA sequences were generated using
ALIGN software in the FASTA package version 20u66 (http://iubio.bio.
indiana.edu/soft/iubionew/molbio/align/search/fasta/). In-house ad hoc
PERL scripts were written and used to manipulate data ﬁles.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of retroposed intronic and intergenic
segments

To identify clear evidence for retroposition of ncRNAs, I developed a
procedure to collect genomic sequences that showed distinct signatures
of a recent retroposition event (Fig. 1). First, potential poly(A) tail
sequences, which were listed as ‘(A)n’ or ‘(T)n’ repeats in the
‘RepeatMasker’ track of the UCSC Genome Browser database, were
collected. There were 26 294, 55 836 and 29 105 ‘(A)n’ and ‘(T)n’ repeats
in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively. Then, ‘chainSeli’
data, comprising segmental duplications of chromosomes, were analyzed
to collect duplicons that were close (<10 nt apart) together with a putative
poly(A) tail. Because I only wanted to collect recent retroposition events,
only those duplicons that met the following conditions were selected:
length difference <100 nt; a ‘normalized score’ of ‘chainSeli’ data >80;
and the poly(A) tract associated with only one pair of duplicons. After
this step, there were 142, 683 and 389 duplicon-associated poly(A) tracts
in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively.

recently retroposed ncRNAs include a strong sequence similarity between
the source and the insert (hatched box), a poly(A) signal in the source

compared with a hypothetical ancestral chromosome; this was assessed
by comparison of orthologous regions of other species. (B) The procedure
for identiﬁcation of recently retroposed ncRNAs used in this study is

Next, I checked whether the inserted sequence was ﬂanked by a TSD.
Boundary sequences, deﬁned as 60 nt from each end of an insert centered
at the boundary position, were extracted from the chromosome se-
quences. The two boundary sequences of each insert were aligned using
the ALIGN program. Those cases with a TSD of 7nt or longer were
selected. After this step, there were 21, 107 and 68 TSD-ﬂanked retro-
position candidates in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively.

To select cases for which the source was intronic or intergenic regions,
the source region of each case was annotated using the HOMER pack-
age. If the source was annotated as ‘exon’, ‘3’-UTR’ or ‘TTS’, where TTS
stands for transcription termination site, the case was discarded. In con-
trast, if the source was annotated as ‘intron’, ‘intergenic’ or ‘promoter-
TSS’, where TSS stands for transcription start site, then the case was
retained. After this step, there were 16, 83 and 57 ﬁnal candidates from
the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively.

As the ﬁnal step, I performed an in-depth manual inspection of the
candidates. Those cases that met the following conditions were discarded:
the source and the insert were two different retrogenes derived from a

single parental gene; more than half of the source sequence was masked
as repetitive elements; the poly(A) tract was not derived from a poly(A)
tail but a microsatellite sequence, such as ‘(AAAAG)n’ (Subramanian
et al., 2003). Finally, 12, 36 and 25 recently retroposed ncRNAs were
identiﬁed in the human, mouse and rat genomes, respectively. The source
and target regions were annotated based on the information available at
the UCSC Genome Browser web server.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of retroposed ncRNAs in the human,
mouse and rat genomes

To collect strong evidence for retroposition of ncRNAs, I
developed and applied a procedure to identify genomic duplicons
based on distinct signatures of recent retroposition events
(Fig. 1). Genomic duplicons with a poly(A) tail at one end and
ﬂanked by a TSD of 7nt or longer were collected. Then, those
cases for which the source was intronic or intergenic segment
were collected.

I identiﬁed 73 retroposed ncRNAs (12, 36 and 25, respectively)
in the human, mouse and rat genomes (Supplementary Table
S1). Detailed information on the retroposed segments is provided
in Supplementary Dataset S1.

Analysis of sequences around the insertion break points
showed the 5’ -TTTT/A-3’ motif (Supplementary Fig. S1),
which is a canonical sequence for the LINE-1 endonuclease
target sites (Cost and Boeke, 1998). This observation suggests
that the retroposition was LINE-1 endonuclease dependent.

The source of the retroposed segments included intronic re-
gions of known genes probably derived from primary transcripts,
promoters or 5’ ﬂanking regions of known genes and intronic or
intergenic regions potentially transcribed as a result of a cryptic
promoter or a nearby repetitive element. A survey of the ex-
pressed sequence tag (EST) and RNA-seq data available at the
UCSC Genome Browser revealed clear evidence for the tran-
scription of the source segments. In eight cases, there were
unspliced ESTs that spanned the source region. And almost all
the human and mouse cases had at least one RNA-seq read that
aligned to the source segment (Supplementary Table S2). Some
retroposed sequences showed strong sequence conservation
across animals, indicating a possible regulatory role.

Twelve cases were identiﬁed in the human genome
(Supplementary Table S1). Nine of these were human-speciﬁc
insertions that occurred in the human genome after the
human—chimpanzee divergence. The source of the retroposed
ncRNAs was intronic (eight cases) or 5’ ﬂanking regions (one
case) of known genes or intergenic regions (three cases). In seven
cases, the inserted segment was associated with a known gene,
including transcript variants of the RPBJ (ID H004), CCNB3
(ID H011) and TBC1D8B (ID H012) genes.

Thirty-six recently retroposed ncRNAs were identiﬁed in the
mouse genome (Supplementary Table S1). In 13 cases, the source
was sequence associated with a known gene, whereas in the re-
maining 23 cases, the source was intergenic. In 21 cases, the in-
serted segment was present in a known gene; in one case, namely,
the Dab] gene (ID M011), the inserted segment functions as an
internal exon of a variant transcript.

I identiﬁed 25 recently retroposed ncRNAs in the rat genome
(Supplementary Table S1). In 14 cases, the source was derived

from a genomic region associated with a known gene. The 15
inserted segments were associated with a known gene. Two of
these segments are part of the 3’ untranslated region (UTR) of
the T rim16 (ID R018) and Wrb (ID R019) genes, respectively.

3.2 Novel exons produced by the retroposed ncRNAs

DNA insertion in a gene could result in exaptation of the in-
serted segment as an exon, resulting in novel transcripts and
protein variants (Kim and Hahn, 2011). Some of the retroposed
ncRNAs identiﬁed in this study now function as novel exons in
the associated gene, resulting in novel transcript variants.

The human T BCID8B gene (ID H012) contains a retroposed
ncRNA in intron 11 (Fig. 2). Within the inserted segment, there
is an activated splice acceptor. A cryptic poly(A) site in the
adjacent genomic region, which is preceded by two consecutive
canonical poly(A) signals, was also activated on insertion. This
resulted in generation of the 12th or terminal exon of the
T BCID8B transcript variant 2 (NCBI accession number
NM_198881). The source of the retroposed ncRNA was the anti-
sense transcript of EBFI. This retroposition occurred in the
human genome after the human—chimpanzee divergence; hence,
T BCID8B transcript variant 2 is human speciﬁc, as described
previously (Kim and Hahn, 2011).

In the case of the mouse Dab] gene (ID M011), ncRNA inser-
tion produced a novel alternative internal exon, the 10th exon
of a Dab] transcript variant (NCBI accession number Y08380)
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The splice acceptor and donor sites of
this exon are within the insert and in the adjacent region, respect-
ively. It was suggested that this transcript variant would produce a
45 kDa isoform of the Dabl protein in mouse cells (Howell et al.,
1997). However, the inserted exon contains a premature termin-
ation codon, which might make this transcript variant susceptible
to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay (Amrani et al., 2006).

The middle of the rat T rim16 gene (ID R018) 3’ -UTR contains
a retroposed segment, the entire region of which is transcribed as
part of the 3’ UTR (Supplementary Fig. S3). The retroposed
ncRNA originates from the 3th gene 5’ ﬂanking region, which
is divergently transcribed from the Btf3 gene promoter. The Btf3
gene has a CpG island promoter that may have bidirectional
promoter activity, in common with many other CpG island pro-
moters Wang and Elnitski, 2008). Similarly, the 3’ -end of the rat
Wrb gene (ID R019) transcript contains a retroposed segment
originating from an intron of the C7 gene. This insertion ex-
tended the 3’ -UTR of the Wrb gene by ~1kb.

3.3 Promoters induced or affected by retroposed ncRNA

Some newly inserted DNA segments can induce de novo tran-
scription of adjacent genomic segments (Kim and Hahn, 2010,
2011). Some of the retroposed ncRNAs identiﬁed in this study
induce transcription of associated genes, producing novel tran-
script variants. An example is the human RBPJ gene (ID H004),
where the novel transcript variant starts within the insert (Fig. 3).
Retroposition occurred in intron 1 of the RBPJ gene transcript
variant 4 (NCBI accession NM_203284). An EST (NCBI acces-
sion number DC397179) starts within this retroposed ncRNA,
and the ﬁrst exon of EST DC397179 is entirely derived from the
insert. The second exon, which contains a start codon, and the
last coding exons are shared with RBPJ transcript variant 4.

Fig. 2. The human TBCID8B gene (1]) H012) in which the retroposed ncRNA serves as the terminal exon of transcript variant 2. (A) The source is
located within intron 4 of the human EBFI gene. The retroposed ncRNA was transcribed from the opposite strand of the EBFI gene. The transcription
directions of the EBFI gene and the retroposed ncRNA are marked by big and small arrows, respectively. (B) Alignment of the source (top) and the
target (bottom) sequences is shown. (C) The TBCID8B gene locus contains the retroposed ncRNA. This insert is present in TBCID8B variant 2 (RefSeq
accession NM_198881) as terminal exon 12. (D) Alignment of the human and the chimpanzee TBCID8B gene is shown. The inserted sequence is
underlined. The poly(A) tail and the TSD at the target site are shown on gray and black background, respectively. The splice acceptor (AG), the stop
codon (TAG), the two consecutive poly(A) signals (AATAAA) and the poly(A) site of T BCID8B transcript variant 2 are marked with two number signs,

three x marks, six asterisks and an upside-down triangle, respectively

Therefore, the novel transcript variant DC397179 will produce
the same protein as the ancestral transcript variant 4. The source
region is the short intergenic region of the U2AF2 and EPNI
genes, which are arranged in a tail-to-head manner: the 3’ ﬂank-
ing region of U2AF2 and the 5’ ﬂanking/promoter region of
EPNI. However, the retroposed sequence is from the opposite
strand of these two genes, indicating divergent transcription
from the EPNI gene promoter, which may have bidirectional
promoter activity. The ncRNA was inserted in the opposite
orientation of RBPJ, so that the EPNI promoter-derived
DNA is in the same direction as RBPJ. This insertion is
shared by humans and chimpanzees, but it is not present in gor-
illas or other primates, indicating that the insertion occurred in
the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees.

If a retroposition event occurs close to the transcription start
site of a gene, the insertion may affect transcription. In the
human CCN33 gene (ID H011), the transcription start position
for two RefSeqs, namely, NCBI accession numbers NM_033031
and MN_033670, is ~170 nt downstream of a retroposed

ncRNA (Supplementary Fig. S4). Interestingly, there are two
CCNB3 ESTs, NCBI accession numbers DB071849 and
DB063071, for which the promoter is situated ~58-kb upstream
of the currently annotated CCNB3 promoter. This observation
raises the possibility that the promoter for these two ESTs could
be the ancestral one, and that the promoter for the RefSeq tran-
scripts is a novel promoter that was created by insertion.
Otherwise, the insertion occurred in the 5’ ﬂanking region of
the promoter of the RefSeq transcripts. Currently, there is insuf-
ﬁcient data to determine which scenario is correct. This insertion
is present in humans, chimpanzees and gorillas, but not in oran-
gutans or other primates, indicating that this insertion occurred
in the common ancestor of African great apes.

3.4 Retroposed ncRNAs that are highly conserved
across animals

Interestingly, 19 cases of retroposed ncRNAs identiﬁed in this
study showed strong sequence conservation across animals,

Fig. 3. The retroposed ncRNA induces transcription of the human RPBJ gene (ID H004). (A) The source is located in the intergenic region of the human
U2AF2 and EPNI genes. The retroposed ncRNA was transcribed in the reverse orientation compared with these two genes. (B) Alignment of the source
(top) and target (bottom) sequences is shown. (C) The RBPJ gene locus contains retroposed ncRNA, within which EST DC397179 starts. (D) Alignment
of the human and the gorilla RBPJ gene is shown. The inserted sequence is underlined. The poly(A) tail and the TSD at the target site are shown on gray
and black background, respectively. The start position of EST DC397179 and the splice donor (GT) are marked with a greater than sign and two number

signs, respectively

suggesting that they may play a regulatory role (see
Supplementary Table S1 for more information). An example is
the rat Lan gene (ID R020) shown in Figure 4. The source
ncRNA is an intergenic region on chromosome 10 that exhibits
strong sequence conservation across amniotes, including the
chicken. Many conserved sequence elements have been reported
to be actively transcribed into RNA molecules (Kapranov et al.,
2007; Salta and De Strooper, 2012). For example, enhancer re-
gions are transcribed to produce eRNAs, which are involved in
transcriptional regulation of nearby genes (Kim et al., 2010;
Wang et al., 2011). Therefore, there is a strong chance that
conserved regions with regulatory potential could be mobilized
by retroposition and that retroposed copies might affect the regu-
lation of adjacent genes.

4 DISCUSSION

This report presents clear evidence for dissemination of cryptic
ncRNAs by retroposition in the human, mouse and rat genomes.

Because retroposed ncRNAs have no spliced-out segments,
the gradual loss of retroposition signatures, such as a poly(A)
tract and a TSD make them practically indistinguishable from
DNA-mediated segmental duplicons. In this study, therefore,
I used highly stringent conditions to collect 73 recent retroposi-
tion cases. Considering the rapid shortening of poly(A) tracts
of retroposed transcripts (Grandi et al., 2013) and the decay of
retroposition signatures over time, there are likely many more
‘aged’ retroposed ncRNAs that I did not detect using my screen-
ing procedure. There is also a distinct class of retroposons that
lack poly(A) tails named tailless retropseudogenes (Schmitz
et al., 2004), which also could not be detected in this study.
Therefore, it is highly likely that the dissemination of ncRNAs
is more common than observed here.

It has been shown that the bulk of the eukaryotic genome is
pervasively transcribed (Birney et al., 2007; J acquier, 2009).
Several distinct classes of ncRNAs have been observed.
Enhancer elements have been reported to be bidirectionally tran-
scribed to produce eRNAs in human neuronal cells (Kim et al.,

Fig. 5. Potential effects of retroposed cryptic ncRNAs on the insertion
region are depicted

2010; Wang et al., 2011). Stable intronic sequence RNAs
(sisRNAs) were detected in the nucleus of X enopus tropicalis
oocytes (Gardner et al., 2012). Polyadenylated promoter
upstream transcripts are produced upstream of active human

promoters (Preker et al., 2008). Many other types of promoter-
associated RNAs have also been described (Taft et al., 2009).
Short polyadenylated RNAs transcribed from highly conserved
regions in the human genome have been reported (Kapranov
et al., 2007). These ncRNAs, especially when polyadenylated,
can serve as substrates for LINE-1 reverse transcriptase.
Therefore, it is highly probable that these distinct classes of
ncRNAs are disseminated in the genome by retroposition.

In this study, I identiﬁed the source of four retroposed
ncRNAs inserted into the human RBPJ gene (ID H004,
Fig. 3), mouse Dab] gene (ID M011, Supplementary Fig. S2),
rat AbcbIb gene (ID R012) and rat T rim16 gene (ID R018,
Supplementary Fig. S3) as originating from the 5’ region of
known genes, indicating that these were promoter-associated
transcripts (Preker et al., 2008; Taft et al., 2009). The human
RBPJ gene case is particularly interesting because the retroposed
promoter-associated ncRNA retains promoter activity, generat-
ing a novel transcript variant of the RBPJ gene (Fig. 3).

Nineteen retroposed ncRNAs were highly conserved across
animals: an example is the rat Lnx2 gene case (ID R020,
Fig. 4). A possible source of these retroposed sequences is
short polyadenylated RNAs transcribed from conserved genomic

Evidence for the dissemination of cryptic non-coding RNAs

 

regions (Kapranov et al., 2007). Another possibility is that these
sequences were derived from eRNAs (Kim et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2011), although there is no direct evidence that these
regions have enhancer activities.

The steps for retroposition of ncRNAs are likely to be
identical or similar to those of retroposition of retro(pseudo)-
genes and repetitive elements (Fig. 5). First, the transcript is
polyadenylated at an authentic or cryptic poly(A) site. Then,
the polyadenylated RNA molecule is recognized by the enzym-
atic machinery of LINE-1 retrotransposons and inserted into
a new location, generating a TSD during the insertion process.
The inserted segments can serve as novel exons or promoters
to produce novel transcript variants and novel protein isoforms.
If the retroposed ncRNA originates from a regulatory element,
such as an enhancer, it could potentially play a role in genome
regulation.

In summary, I developed a procedure to identify recently
retroposed ncRNAs in the human, mouse and rat genomes
and provided clear evidence for retroposed ncRNAs. I strongly
argue that the dissemination of ncRNAs by retroposition is com-
mon. The inserted segments can create novel transcript variants
of the associated genes and play a role in genome regulation.

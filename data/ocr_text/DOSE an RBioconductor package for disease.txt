ABSTRACT

Summary: Disease ontology (DO) annotates human genes in the con-
text of disease. DO is important annotation in translating molecular
findings from high-throughput data to clinical relevance. DOSE is an R
package providing semantic similarity computations among DO terms
and genes which allows biologists to explore the similarities of dis-
eases and of gene functions in disease perspective. Enrichment ana-
lyses including hypergeometric model and gene set enrichment
analysis are also implemented to support discovering disease associ-
ations of high-throughput biological data. This allows biologists to
verify disease relevance in a biological experiment and identify unex-
pected disease associations. Comparison among gene clusters is also
supported.

Availability and implementation: DOSE is released under Artistic-2.0
License. The source code and documents are freely available through
Bioconductor (http://www.bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/

1 INTRODUCTION

Characterizing disease-disease relationships and mining gene-dis-
ease associations provides insights in analyzing high-throughput
data to elucidate molecular mechanisms of complex diseases.
Understanding similarities among diseases and among genes in
disease context helps in early diagnosis, drug repurposing, and
new drug development. Investigating gene-disease associations
with gene lists obtained by high-throughput experiments helps
exploring biological questions in disease context and discovering
unanticipated functions.

Disease ontology (DO) provides a consistent description of
genes in disease perspectives. To provide researchers with more
accessible of disease knowledge, the DO database (Schriml et al.,
2012) supplies a web browser for users to explore DO vocabul-
aries while disease and gene annotations database (Peng et al.,
2013) supplies a web interface for mapping genes and diseases.
D0 is organized as a directed acyclic graph, laying the

foundation for computation of disease knowledge using semantic
similarity algorithms. There are many generic quality tools for
computation of semantic measures including SML, SimPack,
SemMF, OWLSim and Similarity Library (http://goo.gl/
3xCuJ 6). These generic libraries can be employed to analyze
DO semantic similarities. DOSim (Li et al., 2011) was designed
speciﬁc for DO, but the authors fail to maintain the package.
Functional DO (FunDO) (Osborne et al., 2009) implemented
hypergeometric test to assess signiﬁcant of DO associations
with a gene list. However, FunDO doesn’t allow users to cus-
tomize the background set of genes and thus may introduce
biases in the results.

To address the shortcoming of lack of R/Bioconductor pack-
age that designed for computation of semantic and enrichment
analyses based on DO, we present DOSE, that allows measuring
semantic similarity among DO terms and genes using several
information-content and graph-structure based algorithms. For
evaluating functional associations with gene lists of high-
throughput genomic and proteomic studies, DOSE supports
hypergeometric test and gene set enrichment analysis (GSEA),
which incorporate expression level measurements to extract dis-
ease relevance of biological experiments. More importantly,
DOSE provides several DO—specific visualization functions to
produce highly customizable, publication-quality figures of simi-
larity and enrichment analyses that are not available elsewhere.
With these visualization tools, the results obtained by DOSE are
more interpretable.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

DOSE provides doSim function to compute semantic similarity
among DO terms. DOSE implemented four information content
based algorithms proposed by Resnik (Resnik, 1999), Lin (Lin,
1998), Jiang and Conrath (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) and
Schlicker (Schlicker et al., 2006), respectively, and one graph
based algorithm proposed by Wang Wang et al., 2007) to meas-
ure the semantic similarity among DO terms.

These algorithms were extended from in-house developed R
package GOSemSim (Yu et al., 2010). By mapping genes to DO
annotations, geneSim function measures the semantic similarities
among genes based on their annotated DO terms. Four combine
strategies were implemented in DOSE for aggregating semantic
similarity scores of multiple DO terms associated with genes,

including max which calculates the maximum similarity score
over all pairs of DO terms, avg which uses the average of simi-
larity scores over all pairs of DO terms, rcmax which measures
the maximum of RowScore and ColumnScore, where RowScore
(ColumnScore) is the average of maximum similarity on each
row (column) and best-match average which measures the aver-
age of maximum similarity scores on each row and column. The
semantic similarity results obtained from doSim and geneSim can
be visualized by simplot function.

DOSE provides hypergeometric model to assess disease asso-
ciations of differential express genes. The enrichDO function
allows users to select an appropriate background of genes as
baseline. The gseAnalyzer function supports GSEA to evaluate
disease relevance of high-throughput data. These approaches can
be used to verify whether the genes implicated in biological ex-
periment are disease associated and to identify unexpected dis-
ease associations. Multiple comparison corrections including
Bonferroni, Benjamini, False Discovery Rate and q-values are
also incorporated. Disease associations among different gene
clusters or gene lists from different conditions can be compared
using in-house developed R package clusterProﬁler (Yu et al.,
2012). Several visualization functions including barplot and cnet—
plot are implemented for visualizing signiﬁcant disease associ-
ations and gene-disease association network respectively.

Running sum of enrichment scores and its association with
phenotype can be visualized using gseaplot function.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

DOSE was developed using the R statistical computing language
and is released within Bioconductor project. It provides ﬁve al-
gorithms for DO and gene semantic similarity measurements
(Fig. 1A); hypergeometric test for identifying signiﬁcant disease
association of gene list (Fig. 1B and C); GSEA for interpreting
genome wide expression proﬁles in disease context (Fig. 1D) and
comparison of signiﬁcant disease associations among different
gene sets (Fig. 1E). R scripts to generate Figure l are presented
in Supplemental File.

The DOSE package presented here makes use of semantic
similarity approaches and enrichment analyses to facilitate
users to investigate large gene sets. Moreover, DOSE provides
users the abilities to visualize semantic similarities, signiﬁcant
gene-disease associations, and gene set comparison.

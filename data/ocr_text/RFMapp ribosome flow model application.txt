ABSTRACT

Summary: The RFMapp is a graphical user interface application
based on the RFM (ribosome flow model), enabling the estimation
of the translation elongation rates of messenger ribonucleic acids
(mRNAs) and the profile of ribosomal densities along the mRNAs, in a
computationally efficient way. The RFMapp is based on the approach
previously described by Reuveni et al., and unlike other traditional
approaches in the field, which are mainly related to the genes’
mean codon translation efficiency, the RFM additionally considers
the codon order, the ribosomes’ size and their order. Thus, it has been
shown that RFM outperforms traditional predictors when analyzing
both heterologous and endogenous genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene translation is a complex process through which a messenger
ribonucleic acid (mRNA) sequence is decoded by the ribosome to
produce a speciﬁc protein. The elongation step of this process is
an iterative procedure in which each codon in the mRNA sequence
is recognized by a speciﬁc transfer RNA (tRNA), which adds one
additional amino acid to the growing peptide. As gene translation
is a central process in all living organisms, its understanding has
important ramiﬁcations to every biomedical ﬁeld, namely human
health (Kimchi—Sarfaty et al., 2007), biotechnology (Gustafsson
et al., 2004) and evolution (Tuller et al., 2011).

In recent years, there has been a sharp increase in emerging
technologies for measuring different features related to the process
of gene translation (Ingolia et al., 2009; Schwanhausser et al.,
2011). However, this process is still enigmatic and contradicting
conclusions regarding the essential parameters that determine
translation rates appear in different studies (Plotkin and Kudla,
2010); suggesting that the rate—limiting parameters vary across
organisms, under diverse conditions and in different genes.

Ribosome ﬂow model (RFM) is a new approach for modeling
the process of translation elongation, affording the ﬁrst large—scale
analysis of gene translation elongation, while taking into account
the stochastic nature of the translation process. RFM is aimed at

capturing the effect of codon order and composition on translation
rates, the interactions between ribosomes and the characteristics
of the translation elongation process on all its various physical
aspects.

The main advantage of the RFM is 2—fold. First, it considers
additional aspects of translation elongation, in contrast with the most
widely used predictors of elongation that are based on the coding
sequence, such as the codon adaptation index (Sharp and Li, 1987)
and the tRNA adaptation index (dos Reis et al., 2004).

Second, it is orders of magnitude computationally faster than more
comprehensive models of translation elongation, such as the totally
asymmetric simple exclusion process (TASEP; ﬁrst suggested by
Heinrich and Rapoport, 1980), whereas its predictions are relatively
similar to the ones obtained by the TASEP.

RFM is a simple, physically plausible computational model that
is solely based on the coding sequence (i.e. a vector of codons
in each gene) and on an additional parameter (initiation rate).
The model allows for a computationally efﬁcient analysis of the
translation process on a genome—wide scale and across all species.
Focusing on the coding sequence, we by no means to imply that
it is the only factor taking place in the determination of translation
rates. Nevertheless, as it has been widely recognized as a prime
factor in the translation elongation process, we chose to concentrate
on it.

Herein, we present RFMapp, a distributable cross—platform,
graphical user interface application based on the approach of
Reuveni et al. (2011). The new tool will serve the community
by enabling the prediction of fundamental features of the gene
translation process, including translation rates, ribosomal densities
and the relationship between all these variables. Protein abundance
levels are proportional to the multiplication of the predicted
translation rates and mRNA levels and can be extrapolated if mRNA
levels are available (Reuveni et al., 2011). We provide below a
high—level description of RFMapp, with a small—scale example.

2 APPLICATION DESCRIPTION

The usage of RFMapp is straightforward. The input is genes’
coding sequences, codon translation times, initiation rate (which
can either be global/identical for all the organism’s genes or
speciﬁc per gene) and number of approximated translation sites
(chunk size), for a certain organism. The output is a text ﬁle
of the predicted translation features and an optional graphical—
predicted ribosomal density proﬁle. RFMapp provides the genomic
data (coding sequences and codon translation times) for six model
organisms (for a list of supported organisms, see the RFMapp

of life and synthetic simulations.

The RFM has two free parameters: the initiation rate A. and the
number of codons C at each ‘site’ (can be proportional to the
ribosome size). Each site has a corresponding transition rate 2, that
is estimated based on the co—adaptation between the codons of the
site and the tRNA pool of the organism [see the Methods section
of Reuveni et al. (2011)]. The output of the model consists of the
steady—state occupancy probabilities of ribosomes at each site and
the steady— state translation rates or ribosome ﬂow through the system
(Fig. 1A).

As aforementioned, the input to the RFMapp includes a coding
sequence, estimated translation time for each codon, initiation rate
(A) and chunk size (C). The mRNA molecules are coarse grained
into sites of codons according to the chunk size and the coding
sequence (in Fig. 1A, C :3); ribosomes arrive at the ﬁrst site with
an initiation rate A. but are only able to bind if this site is not occupied
by another ribosome. The rate of each chunk is computed by the
RFMapp based on the translation times of the organism’s codons
and the codon composition of the chunk. In this application, the
transition time of a codon can be determined by the tRNA pool of
the organism. Brieﬂy, taking into account the afﬁnity between tRNA
species and codons, the translation rate of a codon is proportional to
the abundance of the tRNA species that recognize it (Reuveni et al.,
2011).

By the RFM, a ribosome that occupies the ith site moves, with
rate 2, to the consecutive site provided the latter is not occupied
by another ribosome. Denoting the probability that the ith site is
occupied at time i by Pi(i), it follows that the rate of ribosome
ﬂow into/out of the system is given by 2(1—P1(i)) and knPnU)
respectively. The rate of ribosome ‘ﬂow’ from site i to site i—l—1
is given by kiPi(i)(1—Pi+1(i)). The RFM determines the steady—
state solution of the occupation probabilities of the equations
below and speciﬁcally the rate of protein production at steady
state.

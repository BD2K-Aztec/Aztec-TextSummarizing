ABSTRACT

Motivation: The analysis and mechanistic modelling of time series
gene expression data provided by techniques such as microarrays,
NanoString, reverse transcription—polymerase chain reaction and
advanced sequencing are invaluable for developing an understanding
of the variation in key biological processes. We address this by pro-
posing the estimation of a flexible dynamic model, which decouples
temporal synthesis and degradation of mRNA and, hence, allows for
transcriptional activity to switch between different states.

Results: The model is flexible enough to capture a variety of observed
transcriptional dynamics, including oscillatory behaviour, in a way that
is compatible with the demands imposed by the quality, time-reso-
lution and quantity of the data. We show that the timing and number of
switch events in transcriptional activity can be estimated alongside
individual gene mRNA stability with the help of a Bayesian reversible
jump Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. To demonstrate the meth-
odology, we focus on modelling the wild-type behaviour of a selection
of 200 circadian genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The
results support the idea that using a mechanistic model to identify
transcriptional switch points is likely to strongly contribute to efforts
in elucidating and understanding key biological processes, such as
transcription and degradation.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the archetypal challenges of systems biology is the task of
uncovering the network of interactions between genes and pro-
teins using data such as that coming from high-throughput
genome-wide technologies or multi-parameter imaging. Time
series gene expression data from techniques such as
NanoString, reverse transcription—polymerase chain reaction,
microarrays or advanced sequencing are particularly valuable
for addressing such tasks especially if the system can be per-
turbed in an informative way. Such data can also be used to
get genome-wide understanding of the variation in key biological
processes, such as transcription and degradation. In many cases,
one is concerned with better-understood systems, such as the

circadian clock or cell cycle, where relatively sophisticated
models exist. In these cases, it is of interest to uncover both
new connections and deeper details of the regulatory inter-
actions. However, when studying systems where there is a
much lower density of understanding, one is relatively satisﬁed
with gaining information on the likelihood of the existence of a
regulatory interaction or the importance of a regulatory mech-
anism. Ahnost all examples studying the response dynamics
when systems are subjected to perturbations, such as drug
dosing (Eisen et al., 1998) or stress ONindram et al., 2012), or
where the progression of disease is studied (Calvano et al., 2005)
fall into this latter category.

Analysis of genome-wide time series gene expression data typ-
ically involves a number of tasks to parse the time series into
groups using various criteria, identify differential expression,
select smaller sets of genes for comparative analysis, identify mo-
lecular signatures and common regulatory elements, sort the data
to identify processes active at certain times and apply network
reconstruction algorithms to identify regulatory interactions.
One is, therefore, interested in computational approaches to
check the similarity or difference in time series expression
between genes and conditions. Many techniques for analysing
expression proﬁles have been used [see Androulakis et al.
(2007) and Bar-Joseph (2004) for overviews], such as hidden
Markov models (Schliep et al., 2004; Yoneya and Mamitsuka,
2007), spline functions (Bar-Joseph et al., 2003; Griin et al., 2012)
and clustering (Heard et al., 2005; Kiddle et al., 2010).
Unfortunately, however, it is relatively rare that, in terms of
speciﬁc molecular mechanisms, there is much common regula-
tion found across the clusters produced by such methods. This is
perhaps less surprising when one notes that the temporal proﬁle
of gene expression depends on several processes, such as tran-
scription, degradation and splicing, and that similar proﬁles can
be produced from different combinations of these processes. In
particular, the amount of mRNA for a particular gene is the
balance between its synthesis and degradation at any point in
time. It would, therefore, be helpful if one could identify the
effect of these different processes from the data.

This requires the development of algorithms to provide more
mechanistic insight by combining time-course expression data
with parametric models of gene expression, and there has been
some progress in this direction. Relatively sophisticated methods
often using stochastic simulation have been developed for ex-
tracting parameter estimates from high-resolution time series
data (Golightly and Wilkinson, 2011; Komorowski et al., 2009;
Toni et al., 2009). However, these approaches are geared towards
modelling the intrinsic noise associated with the birth and death

processes of molecules in single cells and are less suitable for
aggregate mRNA data arising from microarray and sequencing
experiments. Recently, a ﬂexible parametric model for the re-
sponse of gene expression to environmental perturbations has
been introduced in Chechik and Koller (2009) and can be used
in this context. Applying it to gene expression time courses in
Saccharomyces cerevisiae after diverse environmental perturb-
ations they show that their model, which is based on the product
of two sigmoid functions and thus can capture exactly two tran-
sitions in the response dynamics, constitutes an improvement
over other general functional forms, i.e. polynomials. However,
although the magnitude and the timing of the response arise as
meaningful parameters, their model is not directly connected to
mechanism and is still not general enough to explain a wider
range of possible dynamic pattern observed in gene expression,
including oscillations.

Consequently, there is a need not only to decouple transcrip-
tional from degradation processes but also to model general
forms of transcription in a way that is compatible with the de-
mands imposed by the quality, time-resolution and quantity of
the data. In particular, the ability to handle an arbitrary number
of transitions where the transcription rate is changed and to infer
the number and types of these transitions from such data would
clearly be an extremely desirable feature. In this article, we pro-
pose an ordinary differential equation model (ODE) model that
addresses these issues and at the same time can be effectively
ﬁtted to data with sufﬁcient computational efﬁciency to enable
one to handle many genes. It is based on a simple dynamical
model of mRNA synthesis and degradation, where transcrip-
tional activity can ‘switch’ between an arbitrary number of
states. The timing and number of transitions, or ‘switches’, can
be estimated efﬁciently alongside mRNA stability with the help
of a reversible jump Markov chain Monte Carlo (RJMCMC)
estimation algorithm (Green, 1995). Multiple change-point or
switching models have previously been applied to biological sys-
tems, such as inferring transcription factor interactions (Opper
and Sanguinetti, 2010; Sanguinetti et al., 2009), modelling nega-
tive feedback in circadian clocks (Aase and Ruoff, 2008) and re-
constructing unobserved gene expression dynamics (Finkenstadt
et al., 2008; Harper et al., 2011). However, these models have so
far only supported binary expression dynamics, which are not
general enough to capture expression dynamics with multiple
steady-state expression levels.

The structure of the article is as follows. We ﬁrst introduce the
modelling approach and estimation algorithm. The performance
of the algorithm has been studied extensively for artiﬁcial data
(Supplementary Section ‘Simulation study’). To demonstrate the
methodology and its potential further uses, we focus on model-
ling the wild-type behaviour of a set of 200 chosen oscillatory
expressed genes of the model plant Arabidopsis thaliana. The
approach allows us to investigate whether genes with similar
switch event times also have correlated promoter motifs.
Furthermore, we introduce a Bayesian hierarchical approach to
pool data from several experiments and present results for esti-
mation of mRNA stability. The example datasets consist of time
series from three experiments (called E1, E2 and E3) of varying
timescales and sampling regimes under some mock treatment
conditions (see Supplementary Fig. S1 for examples). Each ex-
periment originally consists of >30 000 probes [Sclep et al. (2007);

www.catma.org], which map >25 000 genes from the TAIR9
genome annotation [Lamesch et al. (2012); www.arabidopsis.
org]. Here, we focus on a subset of 200 oscillatory genes
(chosen according to their correlation to a sine function for the
expression data from E1). The set includes a number of ‘core’
circadian clock genes (such as LHY, AT1G01060; CCAl,
AT2G46830; TOCl, AT5G61380). A list of the 200 genes can
be found in Supplementary Table S1.

2 A MULTI-SWITCH MODEL AND ITS INFERENCE

We assume that the aggregate dynamics of mRNA over a popu-
lation of cells can generally be described by a piecewise linear
ODE model where because of transcriptional regulatory pro-
cesses, the transcriptional rate of a gene changes (‘switches’)
from t,_1 to another rate r, at time point s,

dM to — 6M0) for 0<t 3 s1, (1)

rk — 6M0) for sk<t g L.

Here, M(t) denotes mRNA concentration at time t, 6 is the
rate at which mRNA is degraded and L is the length of the time
interval over which gene expression is observed. An increase in
the transcription rate r, from the previous regime can be inter-
preted as an ‘on-switch’, whereas an ‘off-switch’ is associated
with a decrease of transcriptional activity. However, we note
that the expression might not be fully turned off, and that
there may be more than just two states. We will refer to the
model in (l) as switch model. Neither the location of the
switch-times s1,  ,sk nor the number of switches k is known
and need to be estimated along with the kinetic parameters of
the model. Solving the linear ODE for each linear regime and
iteratively inserting the ﬁnal state of a previous regime as initial
condition of the next regime one can derive the following general
solution

M(t) = M(0)e_‘" +%(1 — 6“”)

for an initial condition M (0), where I,>Z = 1 if t>z is an indi-
cator function. Note that by setting

Equation (2) is a linear model

for given degradation rate 6 and switch-times s1, ...,sk. The
dimension of the model is determined by the number of switches
k. The case of no interior switch points corresponds to
M(t)=aoX0+a1X1, that is the solution of a single linear
ODE from an initial condition M(0), whereas each additional
switch-point adds another additive term allowing for

convergence to a new equilibrium. Inference is carried out
assuming that the ‘true’ model is unknown but comes from a
class of models M0, M1, .. where Mk denotes the model with k
switching points. Using the notation of (3), each model Mk is
associated with a parameter vector 6k 2 (a0,  . ,ozk+1,s1,  .,
sk,6,M(0)), the dimension of which changes with the model.
Inference about k and 6k is based on the target distribution
that is the joint posterior p(k, 6k). As this is a case of changing
model dimension, we shall generate samples from the joint pos-
terior using reversible jump Metropolis Hastings (Green, 1995).

Let y = (yg); i: l,  , T; r = l,  ,R) denote the gene expres-
sion data for a particular gene where R denotes the number of
replicate time series, each with T observations for a given experi-
mental setting. Note that the notation that each replicate has T
observations is only used for simplicity. It will be obvious how to
allow for a different number of observations per replicate.
Assuming that the residuals between the ODE solution (2) and
the expression data are i.i.d. normal with mean zero and un-
known variance 02, the log likelihood function is

T R
may) = —(m) logo) — i Z 2 (Mat) — WK (4)

i=1 r:1

where 6k denotes the vector of all unknown parameters, includ-
ing the initial condition, and M k(t,-) is the solution to the differ-
ential equations deﬁned by Equation (2) under model M k.

For given switch-times and degradation rates, we have origin-
ally devised a complete Bayesian regression approach to the
model in (3) by assigning priors and sample from the conditional
posterior (Denison et al., 1998) of the regression coefﬁcients 01,-.
However, analogous to the conclusions of Denison et al. (1998)
in the context of a spline model, we found that the 01,- can be
calculated by standard least squares regression, which is compu-
tationally substantially faster leading to results that, for our pur-
poses, are not distinguishable from the ones obtained from the
full Bayesian regression models. Moreover, inference about the
actual values of the 01,- is not directly of interest, as the time series
data can only be assumed to be proportional to the concentra-
tion M(t), and the values of 01,- are affected by this scaling.

We use a vague gamma prior for the precision, i.e.
p(o_2) = y(103, 103) and update the chain for 0—2 Via a Gibbs
step as in the usual normal Bayesian regression model. The deg-
radation rate 6 is a parameter shared by all models and ordinary
MCMC updating schemes can be applied. Here, we use a vague
normal prior for log(6) and a random walk Metropolis updating
scheme on the log scale. The prior model for k can be speciﬁed
by a Poisson distribution f(k) = e")  conditioned on k g kmax
(Green, 1995). Note that by changing A, the expected number of
switches can be controlled reducing potential model overﬁtting.

With regard to the switch points, we adapted the reversible
jump speciﬁcations of the algorithms used in Green (1995) and
Denison et al. (1998) to our model. We assume that the prior
switch-time positions s1,  ,sk are uniformly distributed on [0, L]
and classify three possible moves:

(i) movement of a randomly chosen existing switch-point s,
with probability nk = l — bk — dk;

(ii) addition of a switch with probability bk = c min(l, 1%”);
and

’ f(k)
for some constant c e [0,1/2]. For k = 0, we set b0 2 l and
do = 0. The acceptance probability for the moves follows the
general rule (Denison et al., 1998; Green, 1995)

(iii) deletion of a switch with probability dk = c min(1 m)

at = min (1, likelihood ratio x prior ratio x proposal ratio). (5)

For the position change in (i), we randomly chose a switch-
time s,- from the k existing switches, and a candidate value 5, is
drawn uniformly on [s,_1 + (b, s,+1 — qb], where ¢ is a ﬁxed min-
imum time between switch-times. The acceptance probability (5)
for this move is

 

05 = min(l, likelihood ratio x «5’11 T ¢) T Six” T (Si—1 T W),

((Si+l — Cb) — Si)(Si — (Si—l + ¢))

where likelihood ratio here generally refers to the ratio of likeli-
hood of proposed new values of parameters divided by the cur-
rent likelihood. For move (ii), addition of a switch, we propose a
new switch-time s’ uniformly on f(L, s, (b), the support of L given
the constraints imposed by d on switch-times s. The proposed
value will lie in some interval [s, + (b, si+1 — qb]. The prior ratio is
then

f(k + 1) 2(k + 1)(2k + 3) (s’ — (Si + ¢))((s1+i — Cb) — s’)
f(k) f(L, s, of (st-+1 — ¢) — (st- + ¢) ’

the proposal ratio is W and the acceptance probability for
a suggested switch is computed by inserting these into (5).
Finally, for move (iii) a switch is chosen randomly from the set
of existing switches, and the acceptance probability for this move
has the same form as for move (ii) with all ratios inverted.

Figure 1 shows the ﬁt of the switch model to El data for the
core clock gene LHY (AT1G01060). The algorithm estimates a
mean half-life of 1.3 h for LHY mRNA and identiﬁes a total of
six switches, which consist of three periodically recurring
switches per day. LHY is a core regulating component of the
A.thalicma clock, and it has been shown to be induced before
dusk and has a peak of expression at dawn (Schaffer et al.,
1998). Around dawn, other clock components repress the expres-
sion of LHY resulting in rhythmic expression (Pokhilko et al.,
2012). The El data have a 16:8 h light—dark cycle. The estimated
periodic switches show the initial gene induction several hours
before dusk and repression at or shortly after dawn.

This example clearly shows that the model is able to identify
asymmetric oscillations resulting from unequal length of on and
off times and switches that cause additional modes or ‘shoulders’
in the cyclic patterns. The traces of the RJMCMC algorithm for
the switches and their times are plotted in Figure 1C. We have
summarized the posterior results by the marginal distribution of
all accepted switch-times by ﬁtting a Gaussian mixture model to
a function estimated by a non-parametric kernel density. From
this, all local maxima are identiﬁed and approximated by ﬁtting
a mixture of Gaussians. We found this to work well in simulation
studies, but note that other parametric or non-parametric
approaches could be applied here. Each mode represents a pos-
sible switch, and the location is summarized by the mean and the
corresponding two-sigma band (shown in Fig. 1C). The latter
could be taken as an indicator of the ‘strength’ of a switch. It
should, however, be noted that by summarizing the marginal

distribution over all accepted switch-times, we are averaging our
posterior information over all models entertained by the
RJMCMC algorithm. Although we do not follow this in
detail, here, we note that it may be useful to investigate the
MC traces in more detail for correlation between models.

Convergence for gene expression datasets from E1 is usually
achieved after 5K iterations (Supplementary Fig. S2), and the
posterior densities can be estimated from the RJMCMC traces of
75K iterations, after the ﬁrst 25K iterations are discarded as
burn-in. The computational time for 100K iterations was on
average 128s on a 2.8GHz computer. Fitting this model is
thus computationally feasible for thousands of genes and can
be easily parallelized.

3 RESULTS

To gain a systematic understanding of how the estimation algo-
rithm performs for time series of varying sampling frequencies
and noise levels, we generate synthetic datasets, for chosen kin-
etic parameter values and using data from E1 to obtain realistic
sample sizes and noise levels. The full study benchmarking the
performance of the model can be found in Supplementary
Section ‘Simulation study’. For the synthetic data, we are able
to obtain accurate estimates for timing and number of switches
and degradation rates under all but the largest noise level (taken
as the 95th percentile from the El data). We observe that the
parameter estimation is invariant of the mode of the switch (in-
crease or decrease transcription rate), that multiple switch points
must have at least one observation between them to be reason-
ably estimated and that a higher sampling frequency is generally
more informative for estimation than a larger number of repli-
cate samples. To demonstrate further use of this approach, we
now present case studies referring to the 200 example circadian
time series.

3.1 Correlation of switch-times with promoter motifs

A common aim of gene expression analysis is to identify poten-
tial common regulatory mechanisms between groups of genes

through clustering gene expression and enrichment of semantic
similarity, such as Gene Ontology (Pesquita et al., 2009), or se-
quence similarity, such as promoter motif structure (Cooper
et al., 2006). Here, we shall use the estimation results from the
switch model for the clustering of genes according to similarity in
switch-time distributions. Compared with the usual clustering
approaches based on similarity of the expression proﬁles, the
basic difference is that we can identify groups of genes that
change transcriptional activity around the same times irrespect-
ive of mRNA stability and whether such regulation is up or
down. Our clustering is based on the similarity matrix whose
entries quantify the pairwise distance between the estimated pos-
terior marginal distributions of switch-times (SD) of the genes.
Figure 2 shows an example cluster from the 200 circadian genes
where we used the symmetric Kullback—Leibler (KL) distance
(Kullback and Leibler, 1951). The KL distance is a common
choice for computing distances between probability densities,
but we note that other distance measures could be implemented
in a straightforward way.

Clustering is performed in all cases applying the afﬁnity propa-
gation algorithm (Frey and Dueck, 2007) to the similarity
matrix. Multiple similarity matrices can be linearly combined,
allowing SDs from multiple experiments to be combined. One
can also focus the clustering on subsets of the domain of the SD.
If the domain is equal to the total length of observational time,
then genes with the same switch-times are clustered together ir-
respective of whether they are on or off switches. As the genes are
all circadian here, the corresponding expression proﬁles of the
genes in that cluster seem to be either in the same or in the
opposite ‘phase’ (Fig. 2A). If the distance measure is applied
separately to the on and off times, depending on whether tran-
scription is increased or decreased, then two similarity matrices
can be deﬁned for each gene pair. Applying the clustering to the
sum of the two resulting similarity matrices gives clusters where
the expression patterns are in phase (Fig. 2B). The difference
from clustering according to overall similarity of the expression
proﬁle is Visible in Figure 2C where the red-highlighted example
gene is now in a group of more highly correlated expression

Fig. 2. Example clusters using different similarity scores. (A) Cluster con-
taining 21 genes based on the switch-time distribution (SD) over the
whole time interval: (i) normalized expression proﬁles, highlighted are
two example genes with inverted expression dynamics (red 2
AT1G10740; green=ATlGl2845); (ii) SD for the two highlighted
genes, indicating the three similar switch times. (B) Cluster containing
24 genes based on the sum of the individual similarity matrices obtained
by separately considering on and off times of the SD: (i) normalized
expression proﬁles, with the same gene (AT1G10740) in red; (ii) SD for
the highlighted gene where the on set is given by the solid line, and the
two off sets are given by the dotted line. (C) Cluster containing 22 genes,
including the same gene (AT1G10740) in red, resulting from using the
sum of squared error between normalized expression proﬁles as similarity
score

proﬁles, but the timing of its switches is visibly earlier than for
most other genes in that cluster.

A commonly explored hypothesis is that correlated gene ex-
pression patterns will also have correlated promoter structure
and regulation mechanisms. In practice, such correlations have
yet to be conﬁrmed. By combining our analysis of switch-time
similarity with promoter motif data we ask whether our ap-
proach can shed more light on this issue. We investigate how
frequently certain listed motifs are encountered in clusters of
genes. If a motif has a high frequency for the genes in a given
cluster then it is more likely that the corresponding transcription
factor binding sites are key for the regulation of those genes. This
could give us an indication of which genes may be turned on or
off by the same transcription factors. Using position-speciﬁc
scoring matrix (PSSM) data from the TRANSFAC (Matys
et al., 2006) and PLACE (Higo et al.,l999) databases, 25 plant
motifs were selected, where each motif is present in at least 50 of
the 200 circadian gene subset, identiﬁed using APPLES (Baxter
et al., 2012) (see Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 for motifs).
These motifs can be grouped by sequence similarity into three
broad classes of promoter motifs, and a similarity matrix is gen-
erated from co-occurrence of motifs between each pair of genes,
which can then be linearly combined with each of the three simi-
larity scores and clustered.

One could obtain a clustering based on motif co-occurrence
alone (Supplementary Fig. S3A), which does not yield any tem-
poral correlation in the resulting expression proﬁles
(Supplementary Fig. S4). On the other hand, clustering only
the expression time series (Supplementary Figs S5—S7) brings
up some correlated promoter structure when using switch-
times, rather than overall expression (Supplementary Fig. S3B).
However, the approach is most informative when both the motif
co-occurrence and time series information are combined in that

we are able to identify strong correlations in promoter structure
together with temporal separation of proﬁles between clusters.

Figure 3 shows heatmaps for the proportions of each motif
present in each of the clusters resulting from combining the motif
co-occurrence similarity matrix with the similarity score of either
the switch-times or the overall expression proﬁles. The last
column (P) gives the proportion of each motif in the overall
population of the 200 circadian genes. It can clearly be seen
that clusters based on the whole switch-time distribution together
with motif co-occurrence show a very high proportion of some
motifs in several clusters. For instance, in Cluster 1, all motifs
from Group 1 and 2 (19 of 25 motifs) are present in 40% or more
of the genes, and in Cluster 7, ll motifs from Groups 1 and 2 are
present in >70% of genes, whereas the population mean motif
proportion is only 28% (Fig. 3A). Clusters l and 7 contain a
number of signiﬁcantly overrepresented promoter motifs, with
q f 0.001 (denoted by triple asterisk in Fig. 3) using the hyper-
geometric test and corrected with a false discovery rate of 5%
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995). Eight clusters contain signiﬁ-
cantly overrepresented motifs and a clear separation of genes
containing motifs from Groups 1, 2 and 3. A similar result is
observed using the additively combined separate on and off com-
ponents and motif co-occurrence for clustering (Fig. 3B), which,
naturally, results in a slightly larger number of clusters.
Comparing with clustering based on expression proﬁles together
with motif co-occurrence, we ﬁnd that the proportion of motifs
in clusters is generally smaller and fewer signiﬁcant clusters are
observed (Fig. 3C). Plots of the expression proﬁles separated into
clusters are shown in Supplementary Figures S8—S10. Cluster
membership and motif proportions for the combined similarity
measure clusters are given in Supplementary Tables S4—S7.

This example makes it apparent that clustering based on
switch-times combined with motif co-occurrence is useful in iden-
tifying correlation between gene expression and promoter struc-
ture and, therefore, also in identifying potential regulatory
interactions. Motif instance data are often noisy because of re-
dundancy and degeneracy in PSSMs, and in genome-scale ex-
pression data sets many genes may share expression proﬁles, but
not regulatory dynamics. By incorporating switch-times with
motif data we can link speciﬁc temporal events in transcription
with speciﬁc promoter structures.

3.2 Hierarchical modelling of multiple time series

Provided that the mRNA process exhibits non—steady-state be-
haviour, the use of the switch model allows for inference on
mRNA degradation rates for many genes without having to
resort to additional experiments that are speciﬁcally targeted at
transcriptional inhibition. Although it is straightforward to
obtain posterior distributions from one experiment, it may also
be of interest to pool the information from several experiments
allowing for the possibility that, for a given gene, the mRNA
degradation rate across the experiments should be similar but
allow for variation because of the setting of the experiment
(different laboratories, techniques, mock treatments and time
spans). We also wish to incorporate informative prior informa-
tion from the study by Narsai et al. (2007), which gives estimates
of mRNA degradation rates of >13 000 A.thaliana genes while
noting that use of such data is problematic because, by its nature,

Fig. 3. Heatmaps of proportion of motifs present in gene clusters using
different similarity measures. Motifs are aligned on y-axis and grouped
into three classes by sequence similarity. Each column gives the propor-
tion of motifs in a gene cluster. (A) Motif co-occurrence is combined with
the switch-time distribution (SD) similarity matrix over the whole time
interval, (B) motif co-occurrence is combined with the SD similarity sep-
arately over on and off times. (C) Motif co—occurrence is combined with
similarity of the overall expression proﬁles. Clusters are assigned signiﬁ-
cance by the hypergeometric test with false discovery rate correction on
the cluster motif proportions against the population motif proportions;

there is no independent validation of the results of such studies,
and their experimental conditions are different from ours. We
address this in the following Bayesian hierarchical modelling
framework.

Let ya) denote the time series data (including replicates) for a
particular gene in experiment 1' and Y the pooled data for that
gene over N experiments. Bayesian hierarchical modelling
(Gamerman and Lopes, 2006) provides a natural framework to
account for the fact that parameters may be similar but are sub-
ject to stochastic variability between experiments. Assuming
experiments are independent, the full log likelihood is

N
Io; Y) = 210543100 (6)
i=1

where [(Qg)|y(i)) is the log likelihood as speciﬁed in (4), and each
60) is a vector of varying dimension k,- containing all model par-
ameters for experiment 1'. In a Bayesian hierarchical model, we
assume that parameters or subsets of the parameters are similar
but subject to some stochastic variation in the sense that they are
realizations of the same probability distribution whose param-
eters we wish to identify. Here, we assume that the mRNA deg-
radation rate for a gene across the experiments comes from the
same distribution 60) ~ p(6(i)|®5), which is characterized by the
parameter vector @5. The latter thus quantiﬁes the mean value
and variability of the degradation rate across the experiments. It
should be noted that with respect to the switch-times we main-
tain a non-hierarchical structure, as regulatory switches may gen-
erally occur at different times for each of the experiments given
that the initial entrainment of the clock may have varied across
the experiment, and the different light/dark input for each
experiment may have caused phase changes. However, the hier-
archical approach can be used for scenarios where there is reason
to assume that switch-times are similar between experiments.
Inference is achieved by formulating an appropriate MCMC

algorithm that samples from p(®5,Y) (Gamerman and Lopes,
2006). In practice, we speciﬁed p(6(i)|®5) by a Gamma distribu-
tion parameterized to have mean Mg and variance 0%. We as-
signed a Gamma prior distribution to the mean [1.3 and an
exponential distribution to the coefﬁcient of variation (CV)
05/115. The CV is used, as the mean value is close to 0; therefore,
it is a more robust parameter for sampling og. We derive inform-
ative priors from degradation rates from >13 K A.thalicma genes
from Narsai et a]. (2007):

. 0‘8
5") ~ 14115.0(?) M8 ~ i/(mvar, 012%,); E ~ EXinvar)

where ,uNa, and 012W are estimated from the mean degradation
rates in the dataset, and AN,” is taken to be the 95% percentile of
the CV distribution from the data. All models use the same in-
formative population-level prior distributions, rather than the
gene-speciﬁc estimates because of large potential differences be-
tween experimental protocols. The approach taken by Narsai
et a]. was to ﬁt exponential decay least squares regression
models to microarray data collected at six time points after the
transcriptional inhibitor actinomycin D was added. Although
this is conceptually a straightforward approach for estimating
degradation rates, it is neither clear whether the method com-
pletely inhibits transcription nor whether its invasiveness has an
effect on the degradation processes themselves. Therefore, a
strong gene-speciﬁc prior derived from the Narsai et a]. estimates
could not be justiﬁed.

Figure 4 shows all estimates of the mRNA degradation rate of
the core clock gene LHY from Narsai et al., the hierarchical
model and, for comparison, the non-hierarchical (independent)
model. The Narsai et al. estimate has an approximate range in
half-life of 1.5—2.25 h, and our posterior estimates are broadly in
a similar range. The estimated joint distribution summarizes the
variability of the three experiments and provides a theoretically
rigorous summary statistic of the degradation rate (which cannot
be achieved by averaging over the independent results).
Estimates from the individual models show a range of estimates
from 1.3 to >2 h. Results for E2 and E3 are more variable prob-
ably because they cover shorter timescales of 17.5 and 6h,
whereas El covering two circadian cycles provides more precise
estimates despite smaller sampling frequency. An interesting ob-
servation is the difference between the El estimate and E2, E3
and Narsai et al. estimates. There are a number of potential
reasons for the difference, given the experiments were performed
over different time intervals and in different laboratories.
However, it may also be related to the light conditions, as E1
is the only experiment incorporating two 8 h dark periods. Light
is a key driver in the A.thalicma circadian clock, and a recent
study has suggested a light-speciﬁc degradation rate for CCAl,
a core partner of LHY (Yakir et al., 2007), and a current model
for the A.thalicma clock uses different degradation rates for the
LHY/CCAl component in light and dark (Pokhilko et al., 2012).
This result complements the hypothesis that light plays a role in
mRNA degradation in at least some core circadian clock com-
ponents. A possible extension to the model could include light/
dark cycles, for which separate degradation rates are assumed.

For further comparison with the Narsai et al. estimates, we
grouped all genes for which there was an estimate available in
their dataset (136 of the 200 genes) into ﬁve broad mRNA

have a similar hyperdistribution estimate using our approach to
the Narsai et al. study, and agreement between the three individ-
ual estimates and Narsai et al. ranges from 34% up to 36%
(Supplementary Table S8). However, despite this overlap, there
is also considerable variability in degradation rates between the
experiments, which may be natural variability or because of the
experiments carried out under different conditions.

4 DISCUSSION

The aim of this article is to present a novel approach for iden-
tifying timing of transcriptional activity from time series mRNA
expression data. The model introduced here consists of a piece-
wise linear simple ODE model of mRNA dynamics, which can
be ﬁtted efﬁciently with a RJMCMC sampler to estimate gene-
speciﬁc parameters, i.e. mRNA stability and number and times
of switches in transcriptional activity. Estimation and perform-
ance of the algorithm is investigated for synthetic data of varying
sampling frequencies and noise levels in a simulation study. With
the example of time series microarray data from 200 circadian
genes, further directions are explored exploiting different aspects
of the model output. Namely, using the timing of the switches as
a basis for clustering, which, when combined with promoter
motif data, seems to identify more signiﬁcant groups of motifs
than simple proﬁle clustering with promoter motif data, poten-
tially implying a stronger correlation with regulatory mechan-
isms. We also explore the potential for the estimation of
mRNA degradation rates. Usually, degradation rate studies in-
volve treatment with a transcriptional inhibitor, such as
actinomycin D, or translational inhibitor, such as cycloheximide.
It is not clear whether such inhibition is ever achieved fully and
whether such treatments have undesired side-effects on degrad-
ation, and may, therefore, impact on estimated rates in unpre-
dictable ways. The model introduced in this study has several
advantages over a transcription inhibition study. The primary
advantage is that a speciﬁc experiment does not have to be

designed and performed, often at great cost in time and re-
sources, to produce a suitable dataset for degradation estimation,
effectively allowing recycling of existing datasets further increas-
ing their potential scientiﬁc value. As only free-running mRNA
expression dynamics are required, potential side-effects intro-
duced by using a chemical inhibitor can be avoided. We demon-
strate how to pool data from several experiments in a
theoretically rigorous way with a Bayesian hierarchical model.
Degradation estimates can easily be obtained for suitably
resolved time series and can be compared between different ex-
perimental conditions. As the number of large high-resolution
gene expression time series datasets publicly available is likely
to increase with the development of cheaper and faster high-
throughput technologies, new methods are required to analyse
these data. The model proposed here is mechanistic yet is ﬂexible
and rich enough to capture a wide range of expression dynamics
observed in mRNA time series data, from steady-state behaviour
to oscillatory expression. At the same time, it is simple enough to
be estimated with feasible computational time for thousands of
genes. Using a mechanistic model to identify transcriptional
switch points is likely to strongly contribute to efforts in eluci-
dating and understanding regulatory interactions within tran-
scriptional networks.

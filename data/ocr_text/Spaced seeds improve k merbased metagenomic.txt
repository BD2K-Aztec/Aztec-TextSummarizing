Abstract

Motivation: Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study genetic content of environmental sam—
ples, which has been strongly promoted by next—generation sequencing technologies. To cope
with massive data involved in modern metagenomic projects, recent tools rely on the analysis of
k—mers shared between the read to be classified and sampled reference genomes.

Results: Within this general framework, we show that spaced seeds provide a significant improve—
ment of classification accuracy, as opposed to traditional contiguous k—mers. We support this the—
sis through a series of different computational experiments, including simulations of large—scale

metagenomic projects.

1 Introduction

Metagenomics is a powerful approach to study genetic material con—
tained in environmental samples. The advent of high—throughput
sequencing technologies (known as Next-Generation Sequencing,
NGS) revolutionized this approach by avoiding the need of cloning
the DNA and thus greatly facilitating the obtention of metagenomic
samples, at the same time drastically decreasing its price. Present—
day metagenomic studies focus on various bacterial, fungal or viral
populations, exemplified by the Human Microbiome project (Methe
et al., 2012) that investigates microbial communities at different
sites of human body.

Modern metagenomics deals with vast sequence datasets. On the
one hand, metagenomic samples (metagenomes) obtained through
NGS are commonly measured by tens of billions of bp (Nath Meth
Editorial, 2009). These sequences generally come from a number of
different species, some of which either have a previously sequenced
reference genome or have a related sequenced species sufficiently
close phylogenetically to determine this relationship by sequence

comparison. Other sequences, however, may come from organisms
that have no sufficiently close relatives with sequenced genomes or
from DNA fragments that show no significant similarity with any
available genomic sequence. The metagenomic classiﬁcation prob—
lem is to assign each sequence of the metagenome to a correspond—
ing taxonomic unit or to classify it as ‘novel’.

A way to improve the accuracy of metagenomic classification is
to match the metagenome against as large set of known genomic se—
quences as possible. This set, stored in a working reference database,
may contain thousands of full microbial genomes (Wood and
Salzberg, 2014).

Alignment-based classiﬁers (Mande et al., 2012) proceed by
aligning metagenome sequences to each of the genomes in the refer—
ence database. This can be done with generic BLAST-like alignment
programs (Altschul et al., 1997). While this approach can be envis—
aged for small datasets (both metagenome and database) and is actu—
ally used in such software tools as MEGAN (Huson et al., 2011) or
PHYMMBL (Brady and Salzberg, 2011) (see (Mande et al., 2012) for

more), it is unfeasible on the scale of modern metagenomic projects.
On the other hand, there exists a multitude of specialized tools for
aligning NGS reads—BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), NOVOALIGN
(http://www.novocraft.com/), GEM (Marco—Sola et al., 2012),
BOWTIE (Langmead et al., 2009), just to mention a few popular
ones—which perform alignment at a higher speed and are adjusted
to specificities of NGS—produced sequences. Still, aligning multimil-
lion read sets against thousands of genomes remains computation—
ally difficult even with optimized tools. Furthermore, read
alignment algorithms are usually designed to compute high—scoring
alignments only and are often unable to report low—scoring align—
ments. As a result, a large fraction of reads may remain unmapped
(Lindgreen et al., 2015).

Several techniques exist to reduce the computational complexity
of this approach. One direction is to pre—assemble reads into longer
contigs, potentially improving the accuracy of assignment. Assembly
of metagenomic reads has been a subject of many works (Teeling
and Glockner, 2012) and remains a fragile approach, due to its
error—proneness and high computational complexity. Overall, it ap—
pears feasible mostly for small—size projects with relatively high read
coverage.

To cope with increasingly large metagenomic projects, align—
ment—free methods have recently come into use. Those methods do
not compute read alignments, thus do not come with benefits of
these, such as gene identification. Alignment—free sequence compari-
son is in itself an established research area, reviewed in a recent
dedicated special issue (Vinga, 2014). Most of alignment-free com-
parison methods are based on the analysis of words, usually of fixed
size (le—mers), occurring in input sequences. A popular approach is
to compute the distance between frequency vectors of all le—mers in
each of the sequences. In the context of metagenomics, however,
when one of the sequences is short (NGS read), the analysis is based
on the shared le—mers, without taking into account their multiplic-
ities in reference genomes. This is also dictated by the prohibitive
computational cost of computing and storing le—mer multiplicities
for metagenomics—size data.

Two recently released tools—LMAT (Ames et al., 2013) and
KRAKEN (Wood and Salzberg, 2014)—perform metagenomic classifi—
cation of NGS reads based on the analysis of shared le—mers between
an input read and each reference genome. Given a taxonomic tree
involving the species of the database, those tools ‘map’ each read to
a node of the tree, thus reporting the most specific taxon or clade
the read is associated with. Mapping is done by sliding through all
le—mers occurring in the read and determining, for each of them, the
genomes of the database containing the le—mer. Based on obtained
counts and tree topology, LMAT and KRAKEN algorithms assign the
read to the tree node ‘best explaining’ the counts. Further similar
tools have been published during last months (Kawulok and
Deorowicz, 2015; Ounit et al., 2015).

The goal of this work is to show that the metagenomics classifi—
cation based on the analysis of shared le—mers can be improved by
using spaced le-mers rather than contiguous le—mers.

The idea of using spaced le—mers goes back to the concept of
spaced seeds for seed-and-extend sequence comparison (Burkhardt
and Karkkainen, 2003; Ma et al., 2002). There, the idea is to use as
a seed (i.e. local match triggering an alignment) a sequence of
matches interleaved with ‘joker positions’ holding either matches or
mismatches. The pattern specifying the sequence of matches and
jokers is called spaced seed. Remarkably, replacing contiguous seeds
by spaced seeds in sequence alignment significantly improves the
sensibility—selectivity trade—off with almost no incurred computa—
tional overhead. This has been first observed by Ma et al. (2002)

and then extended and formally analyzed in a series of further
works, see Brown (2008) and Kucherov et al. (2006) and references
therein.

Recently, it has been reported in several works that spaced seeds
bring an improvement in alignment—free comparison as well.
Leimeister et al. (2014) show that comparing frequency vectors of
spaced le-mers (le—mers obtained by sampling must—match positions
of one or several spaced seeds), as opposed to contiguous le—mers,
leads to a more accurate estimation of phylogenetic distances and,
as a consequence, to a more accurate phylogenetic reconstruction.
Morgenstern et al. (2015) study another measure—the number of
pairs of matching (not necessarily aligned) spaced le—mers between
the input sequences—and show that it provides an even better esti—
mator of phylogenetic distance. In Noe and Martin (2014), it is
shown that the number of hits of appropriately chosen spaced seeds
(i.e. the number of pairs of matching aligned spaced le—mers between
the two sequences) and their coverage (i.e. the total number of
matches covered by all hits) provides a much better estimator for the
alignment distance than the same measures made with contiguous
seeds. From a machine learning perspective, Ghandi et al. (2014)
and Onodera and Shibuya (2013) show that spaced seeds provide
better string kernels for SVM—based classification, confirmed by ex—
periments with protein classification (see also N06: and Martin,
2014)

In this work, we show that using spaced le—mers significantly im-
proves the accuracy of metagenomic classification of NGS reads as
well. To support this thesis, we consider different scenarios. As a
test case, we first study the problem of discriminating a read be-
tween two genomes, i.e. determining which of the two genomes is
‘phylogenetically closer’ to the read. We then analyze the correlation
between the score of an alignment of a read to a genome and the
seed count for this read, defined either as the number of hits or as
the coverage. This analysis provides an insight on how well one can
estimate the similarity between a read and a genome out of le—mer
occurrences. Finally, we make a series of large—scale metagenomic
classification experiments with KRAKEN software (Wood and
Salzberg, 2014) extended by the possibility of dealing with spaced
seeds. These experiments demonstrate an improved classification ac—
curacy at the genus and family levels caused by the use of spaced
seeds instead of contiguous ones.

2 Methods

A spaced seed is a binary pattern over symbols # and — denoting
match and joker, respectively. For example, seed #-## specifies a
match followed by either match or mismatch followed by two con—
secutive matches. A seed acts as a mask for comparing short oligo-
nucleotides, for example sequences gaat and goat differ at the 2nd
position, but they match via seed #—## as the 2nd position is
masked out. The number of #’s in a seed, called weight, defines the
number la of matching nucleotides. In the above example, la : 3 and
the matching (spaced) le—mer is gat. In a slightly different terms, a
seed is a pattern that specifies a small part of a gapless alignment
seen as a binary sequence of matches and mismatches. For example,
seed #—## occurs in (or hits, as usually said) any alignment contain-
ing a match followed by another two matches shifted by one
position.

When spaced seeds are used for sequence alignment within the
seed-and-extend paradigm (Brown, 2008), a pair of matching
le—mers (or, sometimes, a matching sequence of several closely
located le—mers) indicates a potential alignment of interest in which
the two le—mers are aligned together. When spaced seeds are used for

alignment—free sequence comparison (Vinga, 2014), the goal is to es—
timate the similarity of two sequences based on the number of
matching le-mers, with no or limited information about their pos—
itions in one or both sequences. This measure can be defined in sev—
eral different ways.

In the context of metagenomic classification of NGS reads, the
goal is to estimate the distance between a short read and a long
sequence (genome), which can be modeled by the best alignment
score of the read against the sequence. Because of large genome size
and large number of reference genomes involved in computations,
one of the constraints is to avoid keeping track of positions of
le—mers in genomes. We can only afford constructing an index to
quickly answer queries whether a le—mer occurs in a given genome,
without information on its positions. On the other hand, le—mer pos—
itions in the query read can be included to the analysis. Therefore,
we have to derive our estimation from the number of le—mers shared
between the read and the genome, together with their positions in
the read alone.

One simple estimator is the number of le—mers in the read that
occur in the target genome, we call this measure the hit number
However, one may want to favor cases when matching le—mers cover
a larger part of the read versus those with matching le—mers clumped
together due to overlaps. This leads to the concept of coverage (Noe
and Martin, 2014), earlier used in seed—based alignment algorithms
as well (Benson and Mak, 2008; N06: and Kucherov, 2004). The
coverage is the total number of positions covered by all matching
le—mers. For example, consider seed #-## and read gaatcagat.
Assume the seed hits at positions 1, 4 and 6, i.e. le—mers g—at, t—ag
and a—at occur in the target genome (joker symbol is shown for the
sake of clarity). Here, the hit number is 3, and the coverage is 7 as
seven positions are covered by hits, namely positions 1, 3, 4, 6, 7, 8
and 9. Hit number and coverage are two main estimators studied in
this work.

3 Results

3.1 Binary classification

From the machine learning viewpoint, hit number and coverage can
be viewed as instances of kernel functions for sequence data (Ben—Hur
et al., 2008). Our first step is to compare their capacity with respect
to a simple binary classification task. Assume the (impractical) case
when our database contains only two genomes. Given a read, we
have to decide which of the two genomes the read is closer to. How
good can we be at that? Which kernel works better for this task? And
are spaced seeds better than contiguous seeds here?

3.1.1 Classifying aligned reads

Consider alignments AS, A) of a random read to two genomes and
assume they are gapless and have mismatch probabilities PS, PL re-
spectively, with P, < P). Throughout this article, the read length is
set to 100, a typical length of ILLUMINA read. Therefore, the align-
ments can be viewed as random binary strings of length 100 of
matches and mismatches, with mismatch probabilities P, and PL re-
spectively. Given a seed, we compute two counts CS and C) on align—
ments A, and A), respectively, where by ‘count’ we mean, unless
otherwise stated, either the hit number or the coverage. For ex—
ample, if the seed is #—## and the alignment 111101111 (1 stands
for match and O for mismatch), then the hit number is 3 and the
coverage is 7. Note that in this model, common (spaced) le—mers are
assumed to occur necessarily at the same position in the read align-
ment, although in reality, a le—mer of the read may not be aligned

from this fact.

If C, > C) (respectively, C, < C;), then we report a correct
(respectively, incorrect) classification, otherwise a tie is reported. By
iterating this computation, we estimate the probability of correct/in—
correct classification for each parameter set.

Some results are presented in Table 1. In all cases, spaced seeds
showed a better classification power. In some cases, the difference is
striking: for example discriminating between alignments with mis—
match probabilities 0.1 and 0.2 (Table 1) using seeds of weight 22
yields 86% of correct classifications with a spaced seed (coverage
count) and only 65% with the contiguous seed, whereas the fraction
of incorrect classifications is essentially the same. The results also
show a slight edge of the coverage count over the hit number, which
will be confirmed later on in other experiments as well.

Compared with recent works (Noe and Martin, 2014; Onodera
and Shibuya, 2013) showing the advantage of using spaced seeds in
SVM kernels, here we demonstrate the superiority of spaced seeds in
a very simple classification setting where sequences have to be classi—
fied according to identity rate, without a training stage and without
resorting to SVM machinery.

3.1.2 Classifying unaligned reads

Let us now turn to a more practical setting, where we want to clas—
sify reads coming from a genome G between two other genomes G1
and G2 based on the phylogenetic closeness.

To study this, we implemented the following experimental setup.
Using DWGSIM read simulator (http://github.com/nh13/DWGSIM),
we generate single—end ILLUMINA-like reads from genome G. In all ex-
periments, we assumed 1% of base mutations (substitutions only)
and 2% of sequencing errors (DWGSIM options —e O . 02 — r O . 01 —R
0). Given a seed, (contiguous or spaced) le—mers of G1 and G2 are
indexed to support existence queries only. For each read, all le—mers

are queried against G1 and G2 and corresponding counts C1 and C2
are computed. If C1 > C2 (respectively, C1 < C2), the read is classi—
fied to be closer to G1 (respectively, G2), otherwise a tie is reported.
Besides considering absolute counts (hit number and coverage), we
also considered hit number normalized by the number of distinct
le—mers in the corresponding genome (computed at the indexing
stage). This measure approximates the Jaccard index (Bao et al.,
201 1) and reflects the Bayesian probability of seeing a le—mer relative
to the ‘le—mer—richness’ of genomes.

Note that the counts are computed here relative to the whole
genome, as it is done in the approach of Ames et al. (2013) and
Wood and Salzberg (2014) (see Section 1). This makes the seed
weight an important parameter, as seeds of low weight increase ran—
dom le—mer hits that do not evidence any alignment of the read.

We experimented with bacterial genomes of Mycobacterium
genus. Members of this genus present low interspecies genetic vari—
ability and their phylogeny remains uncertain (Tortoli, 2012).

If G coincides with one of G1, G2, i.e. reads have to be discrimi—
nated between their source genome and another genome, then all esti-
mators correctly classify nearly all reads as soon as G1 and G2 are
genomes of distinct species. For example, classifying reads obtained
from Mycobacterium tuberculosis (H37Rv, acc. NC_018143) against
M.tuberculosis itself and Mycobacterium avium (104, NC_008595)
led to more than 99% of correct classifications for all estimators.

The more interesting case when G is distinct from G1, G2 corres—
ponds to the real—life situation when reads to be classified come
from a genome that is not represented in the database. Here, we ex—
pect our procedure to determine whether G is phylogenetically
closer to G1 or to G2.

For example, we classified Mycobacterium vanbaalenii (PYR—l,
NC_008726) reads against Mycobacterium smegmatis (MC2155,
NC_018289) and Mycobacterium gilvum (PYR—GCK, NC_009338)

genomes. Alternative phylogenies given in Tortoli (2012) (Figs 1—4)
imply different evolutionary relationships among these three species.
Our results, shown in Table 2, suggest that M.vanbaalenii is closer
to M.gilvum than to M.smegmatis. For non—normalized hit number
and coverage estimators, this conclusion is supported by seeds of
weight 16 or more, while weight 14 supports the opposite conclu—
sion. This is due to spurious hits that become dominating when the
weight drops to 14 and to the larger size of M.smegmatis genome
(6.99 Mb) compared with M.gilvum (5.62 Mb). This effect is cor—
rected by Jaccard index due to normalization by the number of dis-
tinct le—mers (6.09M for M.smegmatis versus 4.96M for M.gilvum
for the spaced seed of weight 14). Overall, we observe a significantly
sharper discrimination produced by spaced seeds compared with
contiguous seeds.

We also performed a series of experiments with the large and
genetically variable Bacillus genus. Table 3 shows a demonstrative
experiment with members of Bacillus cereus group: Bacillus tburin-
giensis (serovar konkukian 97—27, NC_005957), Bacillus antbracis
(Ames, NC_003997) and B.cereus (ATCC 14579, NC_004722).
The three bacteria are close to the point of being considered to be
different lineages of a single B.cereus species (Helgason et al., 2000).
The results provide a strong support that the B .tburingiensis strain is
closer to the B.anthracis strain than to the B.cereus strain, which
agrees with phylogenies reported in the literature (Alcaraz et al.,
2010). Indeed, the B.tburingiensis and B.anthracis strains have a
much higher pairwise identity rate than the former has with the
B.cereus strain [estimated DNA—DNA hybridization distance 81%
versus 45%, as computed by GGDC (Auch et al., 2010)].

However, for species with low sequence similarity, a large ma—
jority of reads may have no hits to either genome, and only a small
fraction of reads may reveal a significant difference in distance. This
situation is illustrated in Table 4 showing the results of classification
of Bacillus licbeniformis (ATCC 14580, NC_006270) reads against
B.anthracis (Ames, NC_003997) and Bacillus pumilus genomes
(SAFR—032, NC_009848). The results support a higher similarity of
B.licheniformis to B.pumilus than to B.anthracis, but the difference
is revealed on a very small fraction of reads. The conclusion, how—
ever, is significant as those reads represent the majority of reads hav—
ing any hits to one of the genomes.

In all our experiments reported in this section, spaced seeds
showed a better classification capacity. The difference is especially
significant in ‘nontrivial’ cases involving relatively dissimilar gen-
omes, such as those illustrated by Tables 2 and 4. While the differ-
ence between hit number and coverage estimators appeared
insignificant (in agreement with results of Section 3.1.1), the Jaccard
index generally provides a more distinct discrimination and, com—
bined with a spaced seed, appears to be the best estimator.

3.2 Correlation of counts and alignment score

In metagenomic projects, reads to be classified may come from spe—
cies whose genomes are not stored in the database. These species
can be genetic variants of species of the database, such as different
strains of the same bacteria, but can also come from organisms rep—
resented in the database only at the rank of genus or family or may
have no representatives at low taxonomic ranks at all. Therefore, an
accurate mapping of a read to a corresponding clade requires esti—
mating its distances to each of the genomes to locate its position
within the whole taxonomic tree.

With this motivation, we studied how well the measured counts
correlate with the alignment score. For a fixed minimal identity rate
Pid, we randomly sampled gapless alignments of length 100 with
identity rate from interval [Pidul] and collected pairs (number of
mismatches, count), where, as before, ‘count’ stands for either the
number of hits or the coverage of a given seed. For these data, we
computed Spearman’s rank correlation.

A typical result, corresponding to seed weight 22, is shown in
Figure 1. It implies that when the identity rate of alignments takes a
large range of values (minimal id rate smaller than % 0.9), spaced
seeds yield a significantly higher correlation than contiguous seeds,
for both hit—number and coverage counts. Furthermore, the coverage
count slightly outperforms the hit—number count, especially for
spaced seeds and larger weights.

For high-similarity alignments, however, the picture changes: the
coverage count loses its performance, with its correlation value
sharply decreasing. Furthermore, the correlation of hit number goes
down for spaced seeds as well, while it continues to grow for con—
tiguous seeds ending up by reaching and even slightly outperforming
the one for spaced seed. This is due to a larger span of spaced seeds
and to their combinatorial properties that cause the hit number val—
ues to be less sharply concentrated at certain values and therefore to
be less well correlated with the number of mismatches.

In conclusion, while spaced seeds provide a much better estimator
for alignments whose score ranges over a large interval, for high-
scoring alignments (> 90% of identity), the hit number of contiguous
seed becomes a better estimator. The superiority of hit number over
coverage for high—scoring alignments has also been reported in Noe
and Martin (2014). Along with Spearman’s correlation, we also made
an analysis of mutual information computed on the same data (data
not shown) that confirmed the above conclusions.

3.3 Correlation on real genomes

To validate the conclusions of the previous section in a real—life metage—
nomics framework and to analyze more closely how well different
counts for a read correlate with the best alignment of the read to a real
genomic sequence, we implemented another series of experiments.

Given a genome G, we generated a set of ILLUMINA-like single-end
reads by selecting random substrings of G of length L (L : 100) and
introducing la mismatch errors, with la drawn randomly between 1
and 20 for every read. For each read, we computed the counts—hit
number and coverage—with respect to genome G under a given seed,
similar to Section 3.1.2. Collected data have then been analyzed.

Figure 2 shows a typical result of this experiment (for seed
weight 20) applied to M.tuberculosis genome. Each plot shows the
density of reads for each pair (number of mismatches, count), de—
pending on the seed (contiguous or spaced) and count (hit number
or coverage). Spearman’s and Pearson’s correlation coefficients are
shown for each plotted dataset.

The plots clearly illustrate the advantage of spaced seeds over
contiguous seeds for estimating the alignment quality. Plots for con-
tiguous seeds are more blurred, whereas plots for spaced seeds dem—
onstrate a better correlation between the two values. This is
confirmed by the absolute values of Spearman’s rank correlation co—
efficient that are significantly higher for spaced seeds, indicating a
better statistical dependence.

Comparing hit—number and coverage estimators, we observe that
coverage yields a slightly better Spearman correlation and a signifi-
cantly better Pearson correlation, due to a convex shape of the de—
pendence, compared with the more straight dependence for the
coverage.

This analysis has been done for several other bacterial genomes,
producing similar results. Plots for other genomes and other seed
weights can be found in supplementary material.

3.4 Large—scale experiments

To validate the advantage of spaced seeds in large—scale metagenomic
projects, we modified KRAKEN software (Wood and Salzberg, 2014) to
make it work with spaced seeds rather than with contiguous seeds
only. The limitation of this approach is that it allows estimating the
effect of using spaced seeds only in combination with the KRAKEN al-
gorithm and within its implementation. In return, this allows us to
measure the effect of spaced seeds in an unbiased manner, by keeping
unchanged all other factors that might inﬂuence the results.

Our extended implementation, that we call SEED-KRAKEN, allows
the user to specify a spaced seed as a parameter. For a set of gen—
omes, a database of spaced le—mers matching the seed is constructed,
which is later used to classify reads with the original KRAKEN algo-
rithm. Since KRAKEN uses le-mer counting JELLYFISH program
(Marcais and Kingsford, 2011) as the le-mer indexing engine, we
had also to modify JELLYFISH to allow it to deal with spaced le—mers.

Integration of spaced seed into KRAKEN required a minor modifi-
cation of the way KRAKEN deals with complementary sequences. In
KRAKEN, complementary le-mers have a single representative in the
index, the lexicographically smallest of the two. With spaced seeds,
dealing with complementary sequencing is more delicate, as the
complement of a spaced le—mer does not match the same seed but its
inverse. To cope with this, we modified KRAKEN to index each dis—
tinct le—mer. We then processed each read in direct and complemen—
tary directions separately and select the one which produced more
hits. Compared with original KRAKEN, this procedure takes more
index space (additional N 5% in practice) and doubles le—mer query
time.

We compared the performance of KRAKEN and SEED-KRAKEN on
several datasets. First, we performed experiments with three simulated
metagenomes HiSeq, MiSeq and simBA—5 introduced in the original
work (Wood and Salzberg, 2014), each containing 10 000 sequences.
Furthermore, we created a dataset from Human Microbiome Project
data by randomly selecting 50000 sequences from SR5011086
Tongue dorsum metagenomic sample (http://hmpdacc.org/HMSCP/).
Here we only report on results for MiSeq and HMPtongue datasets
and refer to the supplementary material for a complete account
including results for HiSeq and simBA—5. MiSeq is a merge of
ILLUMINA reads of 10 bacterial genomes, and HMPtongue is a random
sample of real ILLUMINA whole—metagenome sequences.

Because of resource limitations, the database we used in MiSeq
experiments was half of the size of the KRAKEN’s default database
(which requires 70GB of RAM). Our database was obtained by
choosing a single representative strain of each bacteria species, ex—
cept for the species from HiSeq and MiSeq metagenomes for which

all strains were included. Overall, this represented 915 genomes of
total size 3.3 GB. For HMPtongue dataset, this database was ex—
tended with a subset of HMP reference library, 0.8 GB in total,
including references for the selected 50 000 sequences.

For each metagenomic dataset, we measured the sensitivity (per—
centage of correctly classified reads out of all reads) and precision
(percentage of correct classifications out of all classifications) of
KRAKEN and SEED-KRAKEN at three taxonomic levels: species, genus
and family. In each case, this has been done with seeds of different
weights between 20 and 31, and for each weight, SEED-KRAKEN has
been run on a few different spaced seeds (see Section 4).

Figure 3 shows sensitivity—precision receiver operating character—
istic curves for SEED-KRAKEN and for the unmodified KRAKEN. In the
case of SEED-KRAKEN, the ‘best performing’ seed is charted for each
weight. Furthermore, triangle points correspond to SEED-KRAKEN run
on contiguous seeds, plotted to measure the effect of our modifica—
tion in dealing with complementary sequences.

Fig. 3. Sensitivity/precision of SEED-KRAKEN (circle points) and original KRAKEN (cross points) for HMPtongue and MiSeq datasets and three taxonomic levels: spe-
cies, genus and family. Triangle points correspond to SEED-KRAKEN run on contiguous seed of weight 24 and 31, plotted to highlight the effect of the change in the

assignment algorithm

At the levels of genus and family, spaced seeds consistently show
a better sensitivity—precision trade—off, with the sensitivity increase
of about 2 percentage points for MiSeq and 3—5 points for
HMPtongue, for a given precision rate. The results of SEED-KRAKEN
with contiguous seeds (triangle points) confirm that this improve-
ment is due to the use of spaced seeds and not to our slight modifica—
tion of the assignment algorithm due to complementary sequences.
For small weights (20—22), a spaced seed achieves simultaneously a
better sensitivity and a better precision than the contiguous seed of
the same weight. When the weight grows, the increment in precision
disappears reaching the level of the contiguous counterpart or some—
times coming down below it. However, this is largely compensated
by the increase in sensitivity.

For the species level, the picture turns out to be more involved.
Here, we observe that due to the small modification of the assign-
ment algorithm, SEED-KRAKEN run with contiguous seeds (triangle
points) shows a modified behavior compared with KRAKEN.
Specifically, we observe a drop in precision and a gain in sensitivity
and those are different for MiSeq and HMPtongue datasets. The rea—
son for this is that SEED-KRAKEN makes more species—level classifica—
tions than KRAKEN but at the same time makes more inaccurate
assignments to a closely related organism (typically, different strain
of the same bacteria), which eventually leads to a lower precision.
This phenomenon has a bigger impact for rich databases
(HMPtongue experiment) compared with ‘sparse’ databases where
each species is represented by few organisms (MiSeq). As for the
contribution of spaced seeds, we observe an improved sensitivity—
precision trade—off here as well. Compared with SEED-KRAKEN
applied to contiguous seeds, this improvement is small for MiSeq

but significant for HMPtongue, which shows a correction capacity
of spaced seeds with respect to erroneous assignments to close
strains. Compared with the original KRAKEN, we obtain a sensitivity
increment of about 1% which becomes smaller (MiSeq) or com—
pletely disappears (HMPtongue) when the seed weight grows.

As mentioned earlier, the spaced seed corresponding to each plot—
ted SEED-KRAKEN point has been selected out of a few (usually two to
four) seeds tried. The full list of seeds applied in experiments and cor—
responding results can be found in the supplementary material. Here,
we just mention that for large weights (24 and more), the span of the
seed becomes an important factor, with seeds of large span showing a
drop in sensitivity and best seeds being those with relatively few jokers.

Building a SEED-KRAKEN limited database takes approximately
1 hour on a server with 20 CPU cores, and the resulting size is 26
GB for seed of weight 24, which compares to the 25GB for original
KRAKEN. The classification running times are longer than for original
KRAKEN by a factor of 3—5 .

4 Discussion

Through a series of computational experiments, we showed that
spaced seeds significantly improve the accuracy of metagenomic
classification of short NGS reads. The superiority of spaced seeds
for different variants of alignment—free sequence comparison has
been recently demonstrated by other authors as well (Ghandi et al.,
2014; Leimeister et al., 2014; Noe and Martin, 2014; Onodera and
Shibuya, 2013). In this work, we specifically focused on the metage—
nomics setting characterized by very large volumes of data, both
in terms of the number of reads and the size of genomic database.

Spaced k-mer—based metagenomic classification

This quantity of data precludes using some alignment—free compari—
son techniques andz leaves room only for highly time— and space—ef—
ficient approaches. Note also that in our setting, we have to
compare short sequences (reads) with long ones (whole genomes),
which makes an important difference with problems considered in
Leimeister et al. (2014), Morgenstern et al. (2015) and Noe and
Martin (2014).

Another improvement considered in Leimeister et al. (2014),
Morgenstern et al. (2015 ) and Noe and Martin (2014) is to use mul-
tiple seeds, i.e. several seeds simultaneously instead of a single one.
This extension is known to bring an advantage in seed—and—extend
sequence alignment (Li et al., 2004; Sun and Buhler, 2004) and
(Leimeister et al., 2014; Noe and Martin, 2014) show that this im-
provement applies to alignment—free comparison as well. However,
each seed requires building a separate index for database genomic
sequences, and therefore it appears computationally difficult to use
multiple seeds in metagenomics, unless some new indexing tech—
niques are designed for this purpose.

In our work, we studied three estimators: hit number, coverage
and Jaccard index. Hit number and coverage behave similarly in
classification (Section 3.1), but Jaccard index generally improves on
them in the case of mapping to real genomes (Section 3.1.2), due to
the correction with respect to the k—mer—richness. Considered as an
estimator of alignment quality (Sections 3.2 and 3.3), coverage pro—
vides a certain advantage over hit number. More subtle estimators
can be considered as well, e.g. by taking into account the position of
le—mer in the read (reﬂecting the sequencing error rate), and this pro—
vides an issue for further study.

Designing efficient seeds for metagenomic classification is another
important issue that goes beyond the present study. Note that optimal
spaced seeds for seed—and—extend alignment are generally not optimal
for alignment—free k—mer—based comparison (Noe and Martin, 2014).
In N06: and Martin (2014), the authors designed (sub—)optimal seeds
maximizing the Pearson correlation between hit—number/coverage
count and the alignment quality. Their solution is implemented in
IEDERA software (The latest version of IEDERA performs design for
Spearman correlation as well.) (http://bioinfo.liﬂ.fr/yass/iedera)
(Kucherov et al., 2006). On the other hand, recent work (Egidi and
Manzini, 2015) introduces quadratic residue seeds (QR—seeds) for
seed—and—extend alignment, which present a good performance and
have the advantage of easy design, avoiding the computationally ex—
pensive enumeration of IEDERA. In our work, we used both IEDERA and
QR—seeds adapted to our setting. We observed that in most cases,
IEDERA seeds are superior (being designed specifically for our task) but
in a few cases, QR—seeds demonstrated equal or even better perform—
ance (e.g. best results of Table 4 for weights 14—18 were obtained
with QR—seeds). This may be due to their large span (cf. supplement
material) for which applying IEDERA is computationally costly.

Real data experiments of Sections 3.1.2, 3.3 have been done
using SNAKEMAKE (Koster and Rahmann, 2012).

Overall, all our experiments corroborate the thesis of better per—
formance of spaced seeds for metagenomic classification.
Experiments with KRAKEN (Section 3.4) give a strong evidence that
spaced seeds can improve the classification accuracy in real-life
large—scale metagenomic projects. One further improvement would
be to implement coverage and Jaccard measures that showed, in gen—
eral, a better performance compared with the hit number.
Introducing spaced seeds rises new issues, such as the construction
of an efficient index of the database or adapting the algorithm of
computing the most likely node of the taxonomic tree from counts
produced by individual genomes, i.e. leaves of the tree. These ques—
tions are a subject for future work.

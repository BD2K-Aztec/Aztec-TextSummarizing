ABSTRACT

Motivation: Subcellular localization of proteins is one of the
most significant characteristics of living cells. Prediction of protein
subcellular locations is crucial to the understanding of various
protein functions. Therefore, an accurate, computationally efficient
and reliable prediction system is required.

Results: In this article, the predictions of various Support Vector
Machine (SVM) models have been combined through majority
voting. The proposed ensemble SVM-SubLoc has achieved the
highest success rates of 99.7% using hybrid features of Haralick
textures and local binary patterns (HarLBP), 99.4% using hybrid
features of Haralick textures and Local Ternary Patterns (HarLTP).
In addition, SVM-SubLoc has yielded 99.0% accuracy using only
local ternary patterns (LTPs) based features. The dimensionality of
HarLBP feature vector is 581 compared with 78 and 52 for HarLTP
and LTPs, respectively. Hence, SVM-SubLoc in conjunction with
LTPs is fast, sufficiently accurate and simple predictive system. The
proposed SVM-SubLoc approach thus provides superior prediction
performance using the reduced feature space compared with existing
approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Comprehension of the functions of proteins is of prime importance
in the ﬁeld of biological sciences (Nanni et al., 20100). One of the
signiﬁcant characteristics of proteins is its subcellular localization
that reveals precious information regarding the working of proteins
(Murphy et al., 2000). Determining protein subcellular locations is
signiﬁcant to the understanding of various protein functions. For
instance, during the drug discovery process, precise knowledge
of the subcellular localization of proteins can be useful for the
identiﬁcation of drugs. In addition, the effectiveness of drugs can
be estimated by knowing the exact locations of proteins before and
after using the drugs (Khan et al., 2011; Srinivasa et al., 2006).
Fluorescence microscopy is frequently used to determine
subcellular localization of proteins in cells. Images of protein

locations are normally analyzed in traditional ways, which are
time consuming and prone to errors (Chebira et al., 2007;
Nanni et al., 20100). Automated approaches are thus required
for the classiﬁcation of such images. These methods need to be
computationally efﬁcient and accurate. Fortunately, considerable
progress is made in recent years for the development of
computational methods that can automatically determine the
subcellular protein locations from ﬂuorescence microscopy images
(Lin et al., 2007; Murphy et al., 2002, 2003). Murphy et al. have
developed subcellular location feature (SLF) sets and trained a back
propagation neural network (BPNN) to test the performance of these
features using 2D HeLa dataset (Murphy et al., 2000). Boland
and Murphy have tested the performance of Haralick textures,
Zernike moments, SLF] and different combination of these three by
employing the BPNNS (Boland and Murphy, 2001). Murphy et al.
(2003) have trained BPNN using enhanced feature sets consisting
of Haralick textures, Zernike moments and morphological features.
Hamilton et al. (2007) have employed Support Vector Machine
(S VM ) using various feature extraction strategies including threshold
adjacency statistics (TASS), Zernike moments as well as a hybrid of
TASS and Haralick textures. Chebira et al. (2007) have developed
automated classiﬁcation system for protein subcellular location
images in multiresolution subspaces. They have employed ANN at
different decomposition levels to obtain the classiﬁcation results,
which are then combined through weight assignment. Nanni et al.
(2009) have utilized random subspace of Levenberg—Marquardt
neural networks and AdaBoost learning algorithm. In addition, they
have employed the fusion between these two ensemble classiﬁers,
while different local and global descriptors have been implemented
as feature sets. Recently, Nanni et al. (2010a) have employed a
random subspace of Levenberg—Marquardt neural networks using
optimized sets of various feature extraction strategies including
Wavelet features, Haralick textures, local binary patterns (LBPS),
local ternary patterns (LTPS) and TASs for 2D HeLa and LOCATE
mouse protein datasets.

The models proposed by different researchers have still margin in
improving the prediction accuracy and reducing the dimensionality
of the feature space. The aim of this study is to develop an accurate
and simple system compared with the existing approaches. We
thus develop both individual and hybrid feature based classiﬁcation
approaches for the prediction of protein subcellular localization.
In the proposed approach, we employ Haralick textures, Zernike
moments, LBPS, LTPS and TASS based feature extraction strategies.
Different hybrid feature sets are formed by concatenating these
features. The performance of various kernels of S VM has been
investigated using these features. To enhance the performance of

the proposed model, the success rates of different SVMS have been
combined through majority voting. Discrete Wavelet Transforms is
used for the extraction of Haralick textures and Zernike moments
only. For this purpose, we have decomposed the image upto four
levels so that the best decomposition level could be detected. Then,
we have used statistical measures to acquire Haralick textures and
Zernike moments from each decomposed image.

Rest of the article is organized as follows: Datasets and different
feature extraction strategies are described in Section 2. The proposed
approach is presented in Section 3. Results and discussions are
elaborated in Section 4. Conclusions are drawn at the end.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

Three datasets have been used to evaluate the performance of our
proposed scheme including 2D HeLa, LOCATE Endogenous and LOCATE
Transfected datasets. The 2D HeLa dataset contains 862 single—cell images,
each of size 382x382, distributed in 10 classes (Chebira et a1., 2007).
LOCATE Endogenous and LOCATE Transfected datasets contain 502 and
553 images, respectively. Each image is of size 768 x 512, having up
to 13 cells. LOCATE Endogenous and LOCATE Transfected images are
distributed in 10 and 11 classes, respectively (Nanni et al., 2010a) Classes
and images per each class of 2D HeLa and LOCATE datasets are provided
in Supplementary Tables $12 and 813, respectively.

2.2 Feature extraction strategies

In this work, we have employed various texture based feature extraction
strategies such as Haralick textures, Zernike moments, LBPS, LT Ps and TASS.
We describe these feature extraction strategies as follows.

2.2.] Haralick texture features Haralick features are texture based
statistical measures utilized by a number of researchers for classiﬁcation
(Hamilton et al., 2006; Haralick, 1979; Nanni et al., 20100). A Spatial Gray
Level Dependence Matrix (SGLD) of size N x N is ﬁrst obtained for an image
with N gray levels at certain angle 6 (i.e. 0°, 45°, 90° and 135°) at some
distance 61 where 61 is measured in terms of pixel distance. In this work, 61 is
set to one. Then, 13 statistical measures are calculated from SGLD matrix,
namely energy, correlation, inertia, entropy, inverse difference moment, sum
average, sum variance, sum entropy, difference average, difference variance,
difference entropy and two information measures of correlation. In this
work, features along horizontal and vertical directions are combined by
averaging. Similarly, features along diagonal and off—diagonal directions are
also combined by averaging. As a result, we have obtained a total of 26
features for each image without Discrete Wavelet Transform (DWT). With
DWT, the number of images at each decomposition level varies as well as
the dimension of feature space as shown in Table 1.

2.2.2 Zernike moment-based features A set of complex polynomials,
which form a complete orthogonal set over the interior of the unit circle,
provides the basis to compute Zernike moments. Zernike moments do
not bear redundant information between the moments because Zernike
polynomials are orthogonal to each other. They are computationally
inexpensive compared with other texture based features (Hu and Murphy,
2004). Zernike moments of an image can be calculated using Equation ( 1)
(Boland et 611., 1998).

In this work, we have obtained Zernike moments of order 12 as used
by Boland et 611. (1998); Chebira et al. (2007); Hamilton et al. (2007).
These features are extracted in spatial and transform domains. We have
employed DWT for the transformation, which decomposes each image into
four subimages. We have computed features at each decomposition level
separately. Due to the varying number of images at each decomposition
level, dimensions of feature vectors also vary as shown in Table 2.

2.2.3 Local Binary Patterns LBPs is a texture—based feature extraction
strategy for gray level patterns in an image, proposed by Ojala et a1. (1996).
LBPS operator evaluates the binary differences between the gray value of
the central pixel c and the gray values of P pixels in the neighborhood on
a circle of radius R around 0. (Nanni et al., 2010a, b; Nanni and Lumini,
2008). The procedure of obtaining LBPS code is depicted in Figure 1.

s(x) shows the value of each pixel p after applying the threshold. The
LBPS code is generated according to Equation (3):

Where gc and gp represent the gray—level values of central and neighboring
pixels, respectively. LBPS are computed using uniform (u2), rotation
invariant (ri) and uniform rotation invariant (riu2) mappings on three
different conﬁgurations: (R =1, N = 8), (R = 2, N =16) and (R: 3, N = 24)
where R and N indicate radius and neighborhood, respectively.

2.2.4 Local Ternary Patterns LT PS is based on the generalization of LBPS
(Tan and Triggs, 2007). In LT PS, the difference between a central pixel c and
its neighbor u is based upon a ternary value according to a threshold 6 as
given by Equation (4).

1 ifch+6
s(u)= —1 ifugc—6 (4)

0 otherwise

To reduce computational complexity, the ternary pattern is split into two
binary patterns according to its positive and negative components, as shown
in Figure 2. The histograms computed from the component binary patterns
are concatenated to obtain the feature vector for the ternary pattern (Nanni
et al., 2010a, b).

LT PS are also computed using uniform (u2), rotation invariant (ri) and
uniform rotation invariant (riu2) mappings on three different conﬁgurations
i.e. (R =1, N = 8), (R = 2, N = 16) and (R = 3, N = 24) where R and N indicate
value of radius and number of neighborhood pixels, respectively.

2.2.5 Threshold Adjacency Statistics TASS based features are
computationally inexpensive and efﬁcient metric for classifying subcellular
localization images (Hamilton et al., 2007). TASS features are computed
from three 9—bin histograms, obtained from three different binary images,
generated using three different thresholds (Nanni and Lumini, 2008). These
features are calculated as follows. First, a threshold is applied to the image
to produce a binary image. Then, nine statistics are computed from that
binary image as shown in Figure 3.

The ﬁrst statistic is the number of white pixels that have no white
neighbors, the second statistic is the number of white pixels that have exactly
one white neighbor and the third statistic is the number of white pixels that
have exactly two white neighbors. This process is repeated up to eight white
neighboring pixels for 8—bit gray scale image. Two other sets of TASS are
calculated in similar fashion. Each set of TAS is computed for binary images
with pixel intensities in the range of p. to 255, p. —6 to 255 and n+6 to 255

where p. is the average pixel intensity and 6 is the user deﬁned threshold.
The value of threshold 6 should not be <30 since less values are considered
as background intensities (Hamilton etal., 2007). We have observed the best
results when 6 = 140 as shown in Table 3.

2.2.6 Hybrid features A hybrid feature model is produced by combining
different individual features to enhance the discrimination power of the
feature space. The hybrid features include ZHar (Zernike + Haralick),
HarLBP (Haralick + LBPS), HarLTP (Haralick + LTPS) and HarTAS
(Haralick + TASS). Only ZHar hybrid features are formed both in spatial
and transform domains.

2.3 SVM

SVM is a popular machine learning technique used in the ﬁeld of pattern
recognition and classiﬁcation. The theoretical detail of SVM is available in
the machine learning literature (Gunn, 1998; Hayat and Khan, 2011; Majid
etal., 2006). It was developed for binary classiﬁcation problems. However,
to employ SVM for multiclassiﬁcation problems, a straightforward approach
is to reduce the multiclassiﬁcation to a series of binary classiﬁcations through
one—versus—rest mechanism. For a k—class classiﬁcation problem, k SVMS are
built where the ith SVM is trained on every instance in the ith class with
positive labels and all other instances with negative labels. In this study, we
have used four different kernels; linear (lin), polynomial (poly) of degree 2,
Radial Basis Function (RBF) and sigmoid (Sig).

2.4 The proposed SVM-SubLoc approach

The framework of our proposed approach is shown in Figure 4. This ﬁgure
highlights a new prediction model SVM-SubLoc based on different individual
and hybrid feature sets. Individual features, such as Haralick textures and
Zernike moments are extracted in transform and spatial domains using DWT.
However, local binary patterns, local ternary patterns and TASs are obtained
in spatial domain only. Hybrid features are constructed by concatenating
these features in different combinations as described in Section 2.2.6. The

performance of various SVMS has been evaluated using these features. The
predictions of these SVMS have been combined through majority voting to
improve the performance of the proposed model. In case of a tie among the
individual classiﬁers’ voting, preference is given to the classiﬁer with the
highest performance.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

The Jackknife test is the most accurate and signiﬁcantly
efﬁcient method for measuring the performance of algorithms
(Hamilton et al., 2007; Khan et al., 2008). We have applied 5—
fold cross—validation to explore the performance of the proposed
approach. In case of 2D HeLa, due to the slight imbalance, the input
data is stratiﬁed before applying the cross—validation. The analysis
of the results for 2D HeLa dataset is presented in Section 3.1. The
features that performed well on 2D HeLa have also been tested on
LOCATE Endogenous and Transfected datasets. In Section 3.2, only
the best results on the two LOCATE datasets have been reported.
However, detailed analysis using LTPS, HarLBP and HarLTP is
provided in the Supplementary Material. We have used Accuracy,
F —score, MCC and Q—statistic as performance measures.

3.1 Performance analysis for 2D HeLa dataset

We have computed the aforementioned measures using individual
and hybrid features for 2D HeLa dataset. In this section, ﬁrst, we
discuss the performance of SVM-SubLoc using individual feature
sets on 2D HeLa dataset. Afterwards, the performance of SVM-
SubLoc will be reported for hybrid feature sets.

3.1.] Performance of SVM-SubLoc using individual feature setS
In this section, we discuss our ﬁndings about the performance of
SVM-SubLoc using individual features constructed in Section 2.2.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using Haralick texture features

Table 1 shows the performance of SVM-SubLoc using Haralick
textures with/without DWT. Here, L and D represent the
decomposition level and dimension of the feature vector,
respectively.

The individual RBF-SVM has achieved the highest success rates
at all decomposition levels. Particularly, its highest accuracy 84.1%
is observed at second decomposition level. Further, the SVM-
SubLoc has brought a signiﬁcant improvement in the prediction of
subcellular protein locations for 2D HeLa dataset. S VM -SubL0c has
achieved the highest accuracy 93.2%, which is 9.1% higher than that
of RBF-SVM. This shows that second level is the best decomposition
level for this dataset. This is because at lower decomposition
levels some valuable hidden information is lost. However, at higher
decomposition levels, we obtained redundant information, which
degraded the performance of the classiﬁers. The highest M CC value
at second level shows that the prediction is quite encouraging.
Similarly, the highest F —score value at this level indicates the best
accuracy at this level. On the other hand, the highest diversity is
obtained at ﬁrst decomposition level with the Q value of 0.18.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using Zernike moment-based features
The predictions of SVM—SubLoc using Zernike moments are
reported in Table 2 with/without DWT. At 0th decomposition

level, the highest yielded accuracy is 46.5%, which indicates poor
feature extraction at that level. Among the base classiﬁers, Sig-SVM
has shown poor performance; only the accuracy of RBF-SVM is
improved with the increase in the decomposition levels. We achieved
the highest accuracy 67.8% at fourth level. Though, SVM-SubLoc
has yielded the best accuracy 58.5% at second level due to the
maximum diversity at this level as indicated by the Q value of
0.01. However, prediction quality and accuracy of the test are not
reasonably good as shown by the M CC and F —score values at second
decomposition level.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using TASS

Table 3 demonstrates the predictions of SVM—SubLoc using TASs
for gray images without DWT. In individual base classiﬁers, RBF-
SVM has achieved the highest accuracy of 81.0% compared with
other SVMS. The success rate of SVM-SubLoc is 91.6%, which
is 10.6% higher than that of RBF-SVM. The increased ensemble
accuracy shows the signiﬁcance of the ensemble classiﬁer. MCC
value of 0.69 shows good quality of the prediction, whereas F —score
value of 0.70 indicates ﬁne accuracy of the performed test. The Q
value of 0.31 reveals that results have 69% diversity. It has been
analyzed during the experiments that TASS have produced the most
signiﬁcant results for 6: 140. The discriminating capability of
these features at this threshold is enhanced. The results achieved
at other threshold values are presented in Supplementary Table Sl
for comparison.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using LBPS

The predicted outcomes of SVM—SubLoc using LBPs are presented
in Table 4. Here, m represents mapping. In individual base learners,
RBF—SVM has achieved the highest accuracy of 88.0% using riu2
LBPs for R = 3 and N = 24. However, SVM—SubLoc has yielded the
highest accuracy of 95.5% using u2 LBPs for R = 3 and N = 24. The
performance accuracy of SVM—SubLoc is 7.5% higher than that
of RBF—SVM, which highlights the signiﬁcance of the proposed
ensemble technique. The maximum diversity of SVM—SubLoc has
been ob served when the features are extracted on the circle of radius
3 as is evident from Q value of 0.25. The best values of MCC (=0.81)
and F —score (=0.82) are also obtained using u2 LBPs.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using LTPS

In Table 5, the success rates of SVM—SubLoc using LTPs are shown
for gray images without DWT. There is an additional parameter 6
used by LTPs, which deﬁnes the threshold. In individual classiﬁers,
poly—SVM has achieved the highest accuracy 94.4% for R: 3, N:
24, and 6 = 80 using riu2 LTPs. The highest accuracy of 99.0%
achieved by SVM—SubLoc is 4.6% higher than that of poly—SVM. It
has been investigated that LTPs have more discriminative capability

compared with other feature sets. As is evident from the Q value
of 0.15, we observed the maximum diversity using riu2 LTPs for
R23 and N :24 and that is the main reason why the ensemble
accuracy is high. An MCC value of 0.95 and F —score value of 0.95
also indicate that discrimination power of riu2 LTPS is better. It is
evident from Table 5 that threshold values vary at R = 1 and R = 2, 3.
At smaller circles, the small value of 6 performs well. However, at
larger circles, the value of 6 should be greater.

3.1.2 Performance of SVM-SubLoc using hybrid feature setS In
this section, we discuss our ﬁndings regarding SVM-SubLoc using
hybrid feature sets as given in Section 2.2.6.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using ZHar

In Table 6, we present the predicted accuracies of S VM -SubL0c using
the hybrid of Zernike and Haralick texture features with/without
DWT. In individual classiﬁers, we have found the best performance
of 80.8% for RBF-SVM.

The highest accuracy 93.2% obtained by SVM-SubLoc is 12.4%
higher than that of RBF-SVM. The second decomposition level has
been found to be the best level for discriminating subcellular location
images. However, most diverse results are obtained at ﬁrst level
as indicated by Q value of 0.12. Highest values of MCC 0.73 and
F —score 0.74 are also achieved at second level, which show that both
quality of prediction and accuracy of the test are best at this level.
The individual classiﬁers using these hybrid features do not produce
better results compared with using their individual constituents.
However, SVM-SubLoc has yielded the same accuracy as yielded
by the ensemble using Haralick textures.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using HarTAS
The success rates of SVM-SubLoc using HarTAS have been given
is Table 7. Among different kernel—based SVMS, poly-SVM has
achieved the highest accuracy of 87.9%, which is further enhanced
by the ensemble SVM-SubLoc up to 96.2%.

This shows 8.3% improvement in the accuracy. The Q value of
0.32 indicates sufﬁcient diversity among classiﬁers. Quality of the
prediction and accuracy of the test are quite good as revealed by
MCC value of 0.83 and F—score value of 0.84, respectively. The

results at other threshold values are presented in Supplementary
Table S2.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using HarLBP

The results of SVM—SubLoc using hybrid feature set of HarLBP are
shown in Table 8. In individual classiﬁers, RBF—SVM has achieved
the highest accuracy of 94.4% for R23 and N :24. The obtained
accuracy is 18.0% higher than the highest accuracy using Haralick
textures (at 0th level) as given in Table 1 and 6.4% higher than the
highest accuracy using LBPs as shown in Table 4 using the same
kernel. The S VM -SubL0c has yielded 99.7% accuracy, which is 5.3%
higher than that of RBF—SVM. It has been observed that u2 LBPs,
computed on a larger circle and concatenated with Haralick textures,
gives more discrimination power to the classiﬁer. MCC and F—score
values of 0.98 each indicate that both the quality of prediction and
accuracy of test are admirable when Halick textures are concatenated
with u2 LBPs for R23 and N :24. However, diverse results are
obtained when Haralick textures are concatenated with u2 LBPs on
circles of radius 1 and 2 as indicated by Q value of 0.14.

Performance of S VM—SubLoc using HarLTP

The predictions of S VM -SubL0c using HarLTP have been presented
in Table 9. In individual classiﬁers, poly-SVM has yielded the highest
accuracy of 94.7% using the hybrid of Haralick textures and u2
LTPS for R=2, N :16 and 6:80. The ensemble SVM-SubLoc
has achieved the highest accuracy of 99.4% using the hybrid of
Haralick textures and riu2 LTPS for R=3, N :24 and 6:80. The
ensemble has yielded 4.7% higher accuracy than that of poly-SVM.
MCC and F —score have yielded the highest values for the hybrid
of Haralick and riu2 LTPs for R=3, N :24 and 6:80. It means
that prediction quality and test accuracy are promising. Maximum
diversity is achieved using HarLTP as shown by Q value of 0.05.

SubLoc using LTPS, HarLBP and HarLTP features on LOCATE

highest accuracy of 99.8% using HarLBP features for LOCATE
Endogenous dataset. However, SVM-SubLoc has yielded 98.7%
accuracy using HarLTP for LOCATE Transfected dataset.

3.3 Comparison with existing approaches

In Table 11, we have carried out a performance comparative analysis
of the proposed S VM-SubLoc approach with previously well—known
approaches for 2D HeLa and the two LOCATE datasets.

The accuracy of 95.4% is obtained by the proposed approach
for 2D HeLa dataset in (Chebira et al., 2007). Nanni and Lumini
have reported accuracies of 94.2, 98.4 and 96.5% for the 2D HeLa,
LOCATE Endogenous and Transfected datasets, respectively (Nanni
and Lumini, 2008). In an another paper, Nanni et al. (20100) have
reported the highest accuracy 97.5% for 2D HeLa dataset. Nanni
et al. (2010a) have also reported 95.8% accuracy for 2D HeLa
dataset, 99.5% for LOCATE Endogenous and 97.0% accuracy for
LOCATE Transfected dataset. On the other hand, our proposed S VM -
SubLoc approach has yielded 99.7% accuracy using HarLBP for 2D
HeLa dataset that is 2.20% higher than the highest accuracy reported
in Nanni et al. (20100).

In addition, using HarLBP our approach has yielded the accuracy
of 99.8% for LOCATE Endogenous dataset, which is 0.3% higher
than the highest accuracy obtained by Nanni et al. (2010a). Similarly,
using HarLTP, our approach achieved 98.7% accuracy for LOCATE
Transfected dataset that is 1.7% higher than that of the proposed
technique by Nanni et al. (2010a).

The performance of S VM -SubL0c approach is enhanced due to the
two level ensembles; one is at the features level and the other is at
the classiﬁers decision level. At features level, we have constructed
the hybrid features by concatenating different individual feature
sets. These features have improved the discrimination power of
the features. At the classiﬁers decision level, we have combined
the predictions of the utilized SVMS through the majority—voting
scheme.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a simple, accurate and effective prediction model
for protein subcellular location images from 2D HeLa and the two
LOCATE datasets. The proposed S VM-SubLoc approach is reliable
and computationally efﬁcient. We have utilized both spatial and
transform domain features. It has been shown that the performance
of SVM-SubLoc is better compared with the individual classiﬁers
using the hybrid features particularly HarLBP and HarLTP in
spatial domain. The prediction accuracy has reached to 99.7% using
HarLBP with features of 581 dimensions. On the other hand, the
accuracy is 99.4% using HarLTP but the dimensionality of the
feature space is reduced to 78 only, which is an effective reduction.
These features are computationally more reasonable in terms of cost
along with better discrimination capability compared with other
texture based feature extraction strategies. In individual features,
LTPS outperforms both hybrid and other individual features in terms
of dimensionality of the feature space that is only 52. Even though
the accuracy is 99.0%, which is a little less than that of HarLBP,
it is preferable to use LTPS because of less computational cost.
Additionally, these three feature sets have also performed well for
the two LOCATE datasets. The hybrid features have brought a
signiﬁcant improvement in performance. This is due to the fact that
the discrimination powers of both the feature spaces are utilized by
S VM—SubLoc.

The comparative analysis highlights the improved performance
of our proposed SVM-SubLoc approach in terms of both increased
accuracy and reduced dimensionality of the feature space over
existing well—known approaches.

Abstract

Summary: PathwaysWeb is a resource-based, well-documented web system that provides publicly
available information on genes, biological pathways, Gene Ontology (GO) terms, gene—gene inter-
action networks (importantly, with the directionality of interactions) and links to key-related
PubMed documents. The PathwaysWeb API simplifies the construction of applications that need to
retrieve and interrelate information across multiple, pathway-related data types from a variety of
original data sources. PathwaysBrowser is a companion website that enables users to explore the
same integrated pathway data. The PathwaysWeb system facilitates reproducible analyses by pro-
viding access to all versions of the integrated datasets. Although its GO subsystem includes data
for mouse, PathwaysWeb currently focuses on human data. However, pathways for mouse and
many other species can be inferred with a high success rate from human pathways.

Availability and implementation: PathwaysWeb can be accessed via the Internet at http://bioinfor-

1 Introduction

Although the inclusion of pathway and gene interaction information
into novel bioinformatics analysis methods is widely expected to re-
sult in more powerful and sensitive bioinformatic analyses, we
found it surprisingly difficult to assemble a comprehensive database
of pathway information in a form suitable for our requirements.
Specific challenges we faced included:

° Finding a single comprehensive source of pathway-related data
that maintains consistent approved identiﬁers for genes and bio-
logical pathways across multiple data sources.

° Finding data sources that provide coordinated snapshots of data
from multiple sources at a given time to enable replication of
results.

° Finding data licensed in a way that would allow us to make our
tools freely available, not just to academic institutions or requir-
ing an additional license agreement for use.

Although many databases and application programming inter-
faces (APIs) exist for retrieving pathway-related data for use in bio-
logical research, they provide data that are incomplete, use different
data identifiers or include databases that are not in sync with one
another. Those incompatibilities make the data difficult to merge.
Furthermore, the APIs and data formats change often and without
warning. Many systems have no API and require either the down-
load of an entire database or parsing of web pages to access the data
using an automated system. Some have severe limitations as to how
much information can be retrieved using a single search.

PathwaysWeb: a gene pathways API

313

 

Because of the issues listed above, we have developed the
PathwaysWeb system. To harmonize the data from various sources,
we ensure that gene identifiers are based on gene symbols approved
by the Human Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC) where pos-
sible. The system presents the combined harmonized data via an
integrated web API. Each set of data loaded from the various sources
is made available as an archived version that provides a snapshot of
data from all of the sources at one point in time. That pattern of or-
ganization assists in reproducibility of analyses. The system is div-
ided into two parts: (i) PathwaysWeb, which provides data in XML
or JSON format for use by automated software systems, and (ii)
PathwaysBrowser which provides human friendly access via HTML
pages viewable via standard web browsers. The code base and data-
base are not currently available for download online but arrange-
ments could be made available to provide this data. A new version
of the data will be added every 6 months.

2 Methods and implementation

PathwaysWeb system provides two interfaces for the user:

° A web service implemented in Java that provides data in
Extensible Markup Language (XML) and JavaScript Object
Notation (JSON) for use by automated systems.

° A web application that transforms data from the web service to a
user-friendly HTML format.

3 Source datasets

The PathwaysWeb system collects data from the following open-
license publicly available sources (with references to original publi-
cations on the sources):

Pathways: Reactome Pathways and Genes (Joshi-Tope et al., 2005);
NCI-Nature Pathways and Genes and sub pathways (Schaefer
et al., 2009).

Genes: HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (Gray et al., 2015).

Interactions: NCBI GeneRIFS; Pathway Commons Extended SIF
(All) (Cerami et al., 2011); Predictive Networks Interactions
(Haibe-Kains et al., 2012).

Other: Custom List of Interaction Types; NCBI Gene to PubMed
(Maglott et al., 2007); The Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al.,
2000).

4 Data processing pipeline

Processing of data from the above sources is extensive. A Java appli-
cation downloads and harmonizes the data and adds them to an
Oracle relational database of 26 tables (see Supplementary
Material). A detailed diagram of the process is provided in the
Supplementary Material.

For data sources generated manually or no longer updated (e.g.
NCI Nature Pathways, Predictive Networks) some data are down-
loaded and processed once rather than with each data version.

New versions of data will be collected from all sources approxi-
mately every 6 months. The steps below are performed by an auto-
mated process that does not require direct manual curation of the
data.

Steps repeated for each data load include the following:

° Download latest ﬁles from sources and decompress if needed.
° Extract subset of tables from databases as individual text ﬁles.

° Filter text ﬁles by removing incomplete or invalid data, unneeded
ﬁelds and information for non-homo sapiens species. (‘house
mouse’ is also retained for GO data).

° Fill Entrez IDs or HGNC gene symbol in records if missing.

° Update gene symbols to latest ofﬁcial HGNC version.

° Merge interactions records from various sources and assign cus-
tom interaction types.

° Assign consistent IDs to pathways across versions.

° Process data from The GO by dropping obsolete and duplicated
terms, calculating all paths from root terms to leaf terms and ex-
tending mapping of genes-to-terms to include all parent terms.

5 Request and response formats

The Pathways system provides APIs for use in retrieving data
through standard HTML-based GET requests. For cases in which
gene (or other) lists in the request might result in a URL longer than
permitted in GET requests, HTTP POST requests are also sup-
ported. The PathwaysWeb API, by default, provides data in an
XML format but can also return data in JSON format.
PathwaysBrowser has the same request methods as the
PathwaysWeb API but returns the data in a human-usable HTML
format that includes menus, a search page and other HTML objects
to assist in navigation among related pages.

6 API resources

The PathwaysWeb API is REST-like and resource-based. The re-
sources include information on pathways (and sources), interactions
(custom types, directions and related PubMed documentation links),
data versions, genes (name and symbol synonyms and associated
PubMed links) and various data associated with The Gene
Ontology. See Figure 1 for relationships between these resources.

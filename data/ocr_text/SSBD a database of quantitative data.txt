Abstract

Motivation: Rapid advances in live—cell imaging analysis and mathematical modeling have pro—
duced a large amount of quantitative data on spatiotemporal dynamics of biological objects rang—
ing from molecules to organisms. There is now a crucial need to bring these large amounts of
quantitative biological dynamics data together centrally in a coherent and systematic manner. This
will facilitate the reuse of this data for further analysis.

Results: We have developed the Systems Science of Biological Dynamics database (SSBD) to store
and share quantitative biological dynamics data. SSBD currently provides 311 sets of quantitative
data for single molecules, nuclei and whole organisms in a wide variety of model organisms from
Escherichia coli to Mus musculus. The data are provided in Biological Dynamics Markup Language
format and also through a REST API. In addition, SSBD provides 188 sets of time—lapse microscopy
images from which the quantitative data were obtained and software tools for data visualization

and analysis.

Availability and Implementation: SSBD is accessible at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp.

1 Introduction

One of the leading challenges of systems biology is to understand the
nature of the dynamical behaviors of biological phenomena. Recent
progress in live-cell imaging techniques has produced a large amount
of microscopy images showing the spatiotemporal dynamics of biolo—
gical objects such as single molecules, nuclei, cells and organisms
(Keller, 2013). Computational image analysis techniques can quanti—
tatively extract numerical data from these microscopy images (Peng,
2008; Sommer and Gerlich, 2013). These quantitative biological dy—
namics data can then be analyzed further to provide crucial insight
into the nature of dynamical behaviors of biological phenomena.
Many sets of quantitative biological dynamics data have been
obtained from various kinds of microscopy images. For example,
Bao et al. (2006) extracted quantitative data of nuclear division dy—
namics in green fluorescent protein—labeled embryos using confocal

microscopy with the aim of deciphering the cell lineage in
Caenor/oabdz'tis elegans. Kyoda et al. (2013) extracted quantitative
data of nuclear division dynamics in Celegans embryos under a
wide variety of gene perturbations from differential interference
contrast microscopy images to understand molecular mechanisms in
early embryogenesis. Similarly, quantitative data of nuclear division
dynamics in embryos were obtained for Drosopbila melanogaster
(Keller et 61]., 2010) and Danio rerio (Keller et 61]., 2008) using digi—
tal scanned laser light—sheet microscopy. These quantitative data
allowed a comprehensive analysis of cell division patterns during
embryogenesis. Cronin et al. (2005) extracted quantitative data of
behavioral dynamics of adult Celegans to understand how genes in—
ﬂuence behavior and locomotion.

Quantitative biological dynamics data can be reused for further
analysis of dynamical behaviors of biological phenomena; however,

only a few existing datasets have been reused even though most are
publicly available. For example, quantitative data of nuclear div—
ision dynamics in D.rerio embryos produced by Keller et al. (2008)
were reused to analyze spatial organization of cells with the use of
newly developed information metrics (Hoh et al., 2013), and quanti—
tative data of nuclear division dynamics in C.elegans embryos were
reused to evaluate image—processing methods for nuclear detection
(Azuma and Onami, 2013; Santella et al., 2010). There are two rea—
sons for the low rate of data reuse. One is that the data are usually
dispersed on individual websites across the Internet, so researchers
often find it difficult to know what kinds of data are available. The
other reason is that incompatible data formats create a barrier for
other researchers to reuse the data because studying each individual
format takes additional time and effort.

Recent progress in mathematical modeling techniques has pro—
vided an opportunity to perform mechanobiological simulations,
which also generate quantitative data. Quantitative data of spatio—
temporal dynamics of single molecules in an Escherichia 6011' cell
were generated to elucidate the mechanism of pole—to—pole oscilla—
tions of target proteins (Arjunan and Tomita, 2010). Data of
microtubule—dependent pronuclear migration in early C.elegans em—
bryos were generated to reveal the mechanism of the nuclear center—
ing process (Kimura and Onami, 2005). In such simulation studies,
data from computer simulations are often compared with in vivo dy—
namic patterns from biological experiments to evaluate the model
validity. Once a plausible model is created, the model can predict
dynamical behaviors over a range of parameter values. The devi—
ation in predictions can be reused leading to further experiments
and refinement of the models (Mogilner et al., 2006). However,
such kinds of quantitative data from computer simulation are nei—
ther stored nor shared.

There is now a crucial need to bring large amounts of quantita—
tive data of spatiotemporal dynamics together centrally in a coher-
ent and systematic manner to facilitate the reuse of the data for
further analysis. Several research groups are developing central data—
bases that store and share data in the field of bioimage informatics
(Lemberger, 2015; Swedlow et al., 2009). The Cell Image Library
(Orloff et al., 2013) and the Image Data Repository (http://idr—
demo.openmicroscopy.org) store and share microscopy images with
meta—information. However, these databases mainly focus on mi—
croscopy images and do not store and share quantitative data ex—
tracted from images. The Biostudies database (McEntyre et al.,
2015) stores and shares meta—information of biological studies, and
it provides links to data sources for a wide range of biological data—
sets. Moreover, there are also several databases that provide quanti—
tative biological dynamics data in the field of computer simulation.
However, these databases were very specific for storing data from
molecular dynamics simulations (Meyer et al., 2010; Van der Kamp
et al., 2010) and biochemical kinetic simulations (Karr et al., 2014).
Thus far there is no central database that stores and shares quantita—
tive data of spatiotemporal dynamics obtained from bioimage in-
formatics techniques or mechanobiological modeling techniques.

In this paper, we present the Systems Science of Biological
Dynamics database (SSBD; http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp) for storing and
sharing quantitative biological dynamics data. This database is de—
veloped and maintained with support from Japan’s National
Bioscience Database Center (NBDC; http://biosciencedbc.jp/en/) as
a part of the Life Science Database Integration Project in Japan
(http://biosciencedbc.jp/en/about—us/projects—and—activities). NBDC
is part of the Japan Science and Technology Agency (JST). The
Ministry of Education, Culture, Sports, Science and Technology of
Japan (MEXT) requests all researchers in the life sciences in Japan

to provide their data to support the project. SSBD was developed to
sustainably store and share quantitative biological dynamics data
that are created by the Japanese science community and beyond. It
provides users with central access to quantitative data, and the mi—
croscopy images from which the quantitative data were obtained. It
also provides additional software tools for data visualization and
analysis.

2 Methods
2.1 Concept behind SSBD

SSBD is designed to store and share quantitative data of spatiotem—
poral dynamics of biological objects ranging from single molecules
to organisms in a coherent and systematic manner. The data stored
in SSBD can be accessed in two systematic ways. The first way is to
download a dataset with the use of a unified format for representing
quantitative biological dynamics data called Biological Dynamics
Markup Language (BDML; Kyoda et al., 2015 ). BDML is the only
open format that supports a wide variety of types of quantitative
biological dynamics data. The second way is through the use of a
REST API (Representational State Transfer Application
Programming Interface; Fielding and Taylor, 2002). In addition,
SSBD stores and shares microscopy images from which the quantita—
tive data were obtained, and ofﬂine software tools to access BDML
files for data visualization and analysis. Furthermore, the SSBD web—
site allows users to visualize quantitative data and microscopy
images directly in a web browser. SSBD is a unique database for
data—driven biology in that it allows users to access large sets of di—
verse quantitative data together with microscopy images and soft—
ware tools.

2.2 Data collection and annotation

SSBD currently only provides quantitative biological dynamics data
published in peer—reviewed journal papers. This policy is to ensure
that the data have been peer—reviewed and are of acceptable quality.
Because the data are often described in their original data formats
stored on authors’ websites, we currently convert each of them into
BDML format (Kyoda et al., 2015 ) and then make that data avail—
able in SSBD with the authors’ permissions. As mentioned above,
SSBD was originally developed to store and share all quantitative
biological dynamics data produced publicly by the Japanese science
community; however, we also encourage international research
groups to use SSBD to store and share their quantitative data.
Therefore, SSBD is open to requests from all research scientists who
would like to provide their data (http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/contact/).

When using quantitative data in SSBD, users should be able to
refer back to the original paper. Therefore, each dataset is annotated
with a PubMed identifier. Names and contact information of the
corresponding authors for the article are also stored as meta—
information within SSBD.

License information is annotated based on the permission
granted by the corresponding authors of the article and the owner of
the dataset. The individual license information allows both data pro—
viders and data users to easily share their data. SSBD recommends
data to be distributed under the terms of the Creative Commons
License (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/). This will encourage
and facilitate further sharing and reuse of quantitative data.

2.3 Database design
SSBD stores three types of resources: quantitative data with meta—
information, microscopy images from which the quantitative data

SSBD

 

were obtained, and software tools for data visualization and
analysis.

In SSBD, quantitative data are stored in two different representa—
tions. Each dataset is stored as a BDML formatted file and a set of
tables within a relational database (Fig. 1). The BDML file allows
users to download the complete dataset directly, whereas the rela—
tional database allows users to search and find similarities across the
entire database. Relational tables also allow users to have direct ac—
cess to a specific part of the quantitative data through the REST API
without downloading the whole dataset (see ‘Web services’ section).
We chose to use a relational database rather than a native XML
database because relational databases give better response times
during searches and have much better tools and support for software
and web service development (Li et al., 2010).

SSBD also stores the microscopy images from which the quanti-
tative data were obtained. Internal to SSBD, the images are handled
by the Open Microscopy Environment Remote Objects (OMERO)
software platform (Fig. 1; Allan at al., 2012). OMERO supports
over 130 image file formats including all major microscope formats;
therefore, most microscopy images can be managed without the con—
cern of incompatible image file formats. Meta—information
embedded in the images, such as pixel size, time interval and config-
uration of microscope system, is automatically stored in a relational
database and can be accessed by the users.

SSBD is also a repository for sharing BDML—compatible soft—
ware tools for data visualization and analysis. All software tools are
stored in the file system of SSBD and are downloadable at http://
ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/software/ without any registration requirement.

3 Implementation

3.1 SSBD implementation

SSBD is implemented on a Red Hat Enterprise Linux server release
6.6 with Apache HTTP server 2.2.15. The current release of SSBD is
built on a Django 1.5.2 web application framework running Python
2.6.6. Quantitative data are stored in a PostgreSQL 8.4.20 relational
database. Microscopy images are managed by OMERO 5.0.4 run—
ning on Django 1.6 and Java OpenJDK 1.7.0_45.

The SSBD REST API was implemented using the Tastypie 0.10
framework for Django. A reference implementation using Python
and Java applications to access the REST API can be found at
https://github.com/openssbd/.

The browser—based 4D viewer for quantitative data is imple—
mented using JavaScript based on the three.js r66 framework,

obtain the data and images together with BDML-compatible software tools

jQuery 1.10.2 and j Query—UI 1.10.4 library. The three.js framework
is based on Web Graphics Library (WebGL) whereas j Query utilizes
Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX) technology. All modern
browsers support both WebGL and AJAX without additional plugin
or software installation.

3.2 Software implementation

SSBD currently provides software tools named BDML4DViewer
and Phenochar for visualization and analysis, respectively, of quan—
titative data in BDML format (see ‘Software tools’ section for de—
tails). BDML4DViewer is implemented as a plugin of ImageJ
(Schneider et al., 2012) using the Java programming language. Java
Architecture for XML Binding (JAXB) and Java Binding for the
OpenGL (JOGL) APIs are required for installing this plugin. Source
codes and the executable JAR file for this plugin are available online
at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/BDML4DViewer/. Phenochar is imple-
mented in the C programming language. CodeSynthesis XSD is
required to compile this tool. Source codes of this tool are available
online at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/phenochar/.

SSBD also provides a plugin of ImageJ named SSBD-
OMERO.insight—ij to access the microscopy images stored in SSBD.
This plugin was created by modifying the login functions of the ori-
ginal OMERO.insight—ij software, which was released by the OME
consortium. The executable JAR file for this plugin is available on-
line at http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/SSBD—OMERO.insight/.

OpenSSBD is the open—source version of SSBD for managing
quantitative biological dynamics data. The current release of
OpenSSBD is implemented in Python 2.7.6 using a Django 1.6.1
and PostgreSQL 9.3.10 relational database engine on the Ubuntu
14.04 operating system. All source codes and additional REST API
for importing data from BDML files into the relational database are
available at https://github.com/openssbd/. A Docker container for
OpenSSBD is also available at https://hub.docker.com/r/openssbd/
public/.

quantitative data that use the BDML format. It also provides soft—
ware to directly read microscopy images from SSBD. An open-
source version of SSBD is also made available. This software is cur—
rently licensed under GNU GPLV3 to ensure that users are free to
use, modify, enhance and share their contribution with the

4.3.1 BDML4DViewer

BDML4DViewer is a software tool implemented as a plugin of
ImageJ for interactively visualizing quantitative data in BDML for—
mat (Fig. 2). Time series of 3D spatial data represented as predefined
geometric entities such as points, lines, spheres, faces and their com—
binations can be viewed using a mouse and keyboard.

4.3.2 Phenochar

Phenochar is a standalone software tool for extracting various kinds
of phenotypic characters from quantitative data in BDML format:
e.g. rate of increase in the number of biological objects such as nu—
clei over time and changes in spatial displacement of objects over
time. It can be used to compare data from different laboratories
even when different microscopy equipment was used.

4.3.3 SSBD-OMERO.insight-ij

SSBD—OMERO.insight—ij is a software tool implemented as a plugin
of ImageJ for accessing the microscopy images stored in SSBD. This
plugin enables the user to directly read and analyze the microscopy
images.

4.3.4 OpenSSBD

OpenSSBD is the open—source version of SSBD for managing quanti-
tative data. It enables each individual scientist or research group to
set up their own database on their own server to independently store
and share their quantitative data. It provides the essential functions
of SSBD, e.g. a simple keyword search function, REST API direct ac-
cess to quantitative data, and a simple browser—based viewer for
visualization of quantitative data.

5 Web services

5.1 Keyword search

Users can enter a keyword search that looks for matching text in the
title, description, contact information, schema version and other
meta-information of all the quantitative data stored in the database
(Fig. 3). They can search by combining the logical operators AND,
OR and NOT. The search result returns links to summary pages for
individual datasets together with some meta—information. A sum-
mary page allows the users to visualize and download not only the
quantitative data but also the corresponding microscopy images
when those images are available (Fig. 4). This page can be directly
accessed using bdmlID, which is a unique identifier of the BDML

Fig. 4 Screenshot of a summary page of quantitative data. Panel (A) shows
meta-information about the quantitative data. Panel (B) shows the four but-
tons that allow the user to choose to view the quantitative data, or download
the microscopy images, or BDML or PDPML (Procedure for Data Processing
Markup Language; Kyoda et al., 2015) formatted files for the quantitative
data. PDPML files describe the procedures used to obtain quantitative data,
either from image analysis techniques or from computer simulations. BDML
and PDPML files use human readable filenames. For example, in
‘RNAi_F54E7.3_070927_01.bdm|0.18.xml’, a BDML file name for quantitative
data of nuclear division dynamics of C.elegans embryos, ‘RNAi_F54E7.3' indi-
cates that the open reading frame of the gene F54E7.3 has been inactivated
by RNAi, and ‘bdml0.18’ indicates that the file uses BDML version 0.18 for-
mat. Panel (C) appears when the images are available in SSBD. This panel
displays the meta-information about the microscopy images with a link to the
page of the OMERO platform

file: for an example, see http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/search/df2a9568—
9c33-4b48-b138-46548bccff6d/.

5.2 Data visualization on web browser

Visualization of quantitative data is important to understand elem—
ents of biological dynamics such as position and movement. A
browser—based four—dimensional (4D) viewer was developed to visu—
alize on—demand the quantitative data in SSBD (Fig. 5). It allows
users to visualize time series of 3D spatial data without first down—
loading the dataset. Users can explore SSBD datasets online before
choosing the relevant data to download for further analysis.
Quantitative data is visualized as 4D models on a web browser.
Users can change view angles and time points with mouse oper—
ations. Data is updated in the background without reloading the en—
tire web page.

5.3 REST API

Users can directly access quantitative data stored in SSBD by means
of an API based on the REST pattern (Fielding and Taylor, 2002).
REST uses the same Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) that a
web browser uses to request and receive data via Uniform Resource
Locators (URLs). SSBD REST API is a simple web—based service
interface allowing any programming language (e.g. Python, Java) to
have direct access to the SSBD data. Output supports both
JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) and XML formats. Figure 6

5.4 Linked meta—information

SSBD provides Resource Description Framework (RDF; http://
www.w3.org/TR/rdf11—concepts/) formatted meta—information of
the quantitative data and their corresponding microscopy images at
RIKEN Meta Database (http://metadb.riken.jp/metadb/db/SSBD). It
allows data on SSBD to be searched by other databases. RDF is the
current trend in linking different databases together (Jupp et al.,
2014; Katayama et al., 2013). The SSBD—RDF data consists of 18
319 triples (data entities of subject—predicate—object form). The
SPARQL query language (SPARQL; http://www.w3.org/TR/rdf—

D.melanogaster(Keller et al., 2010) in SSBD

sparql—query/) can be used on the website to query the SSBD—RDF
data. Detailed documentation about the semantic relationships of
SSBD-RDF data and examples of SPARQL queries are provided at
http://ssbd.qbic.riken.jp/rdf/.

SSBD also provides links to three external databases: Ensembl
(Yates et al., 2015; release 76 version 2018.8) for genomic informa-
tion, WormBase (Yook et al., 2012; version WSZ46) for genetic in-
formation in C.elegans and PubMed (http://www.pubmed.gov) for
scientific literature. We will add external links to various external
databases for genome and genetic information according to the
needs when storing new quantitative data obtained from gene
knockout or knockdown experiments.

6 Applications of SSBD

To demonstrate how quantitative data stored in SSBD can be reused
to understand biological processes, we used the database to analyze
time—dependent proliferation patterns during embryogenesis in
D.rerio and D.melanogaster (Fig. 7).

Previous studies in C.elegans showed that time—dependent prolif—
eration pattern analysis provides insights into the mechanisms of de—
velopment (Bao et al., 2008; Deppe et al., 1978; Sulston et al.,
1983). In C.elegans, a stepwise increase in nuclear number through-
out embryogenesis was observed; this increase was shown to origin—
ate from synchronous cell divisions of the descendants of the ‘AB’
founder cell (Sulston et al., 1983; Fig. 7A). To conduct time—
dependent proliferation pattern analysis of D.rerio and
D.melanogaster, we calculated nuclear number throughout embryo—
genesis from the quantitative data of D.rerio (Keller et al., 2008)
and D.melanogaster (Keller et al., 2010); such calculations can be
made by applying Phenochar (see ‘Software tools’ section) to the
BDML files stored in SSBD or using the SSBD REST API.

In D.rerio, we found a precise stepwise pattern in the early stage
of embryogenesis (Fig. 7B). The stepwise pattern was gradually bro—
ken at around the 10th zygotic cell cycle, and the stepwise pattern
started to transition to a linear pattern. This result suggests that cell
divisions are synchronous in the early stage and become asynchron—
ous around the 10th zygotic cell cycle in the whole embryo. This re-
sult is consistent with the observations reported previously for time—
lapse recordings of part of a D.rerio embryo: cell cycle lengthening
was first observed in most cells at the 10th zygotic cell cycle and var—
ied in extent (Kane and Kimmel, 1993). It will be intriguing to un-
cover the molecular mechanisms that switch cell divisions from
synchronous to asynchronous in a whole embryo.

In D.melanogaster, a rapid stepwise increase in nuclear number
was also observed until the 50th time point, which corresponds to
4.5 h.p.f. (Fig. 7C). This increase is consistent with well—known

phenomena called mitotic waves (Foe and Alberts, 1983). We found
a temporary decrease in the nuclear number at the 5 0th time point
(4.5 h.p.f.). Such a decrease might be caused by cell death, cell fu—
sion, or errors in nuclear detection. It is likely that the observed de—
crease was caused at least in part by errors in nuclear detection
because the time point corresponds to the onset of mesoderm intern-
alization. Mesoderm internalization affects the performance of the
image—processing method for nuclear detection (Keller et al., 2010).
This result suggests that even a feature in the time—dependent prolif—
eration pattern caused by errors in nuclear detection can be inform-
ative. Such a feature may reflect a change in the mode of biological
processes. Further analysis will be needed to clarify the relative con—
tribution of cell death, cell fusion and errors in nuclear detection to
the observed decrease. To this end, the original image data that were
used to produce the quantitative data are desired. SSBD can provide
a platform to publish such original image data.

These results indicate that time—dependent proliferation analysis
can provide insights into synchrony and asynchrony of cell or nu-
clear divisions, and other biological processes such as cell death, cell
fusion and cell internalization during embryogenesis. This analysis
demonstrates how quantitative data stored in SSBD can be reused to
understand biological processes.

7 Discussion

SSBD is a database for storing and sharing quantitative biological
dynamics data for biological objects of various scales, ranging from
single molecules to organisms. Over 310 sets of quantitative data of
biological dynamics can be reused in BDML formatted (Kyoda
et al., 2015) files and through the SSBD REST API. As an example
of the reuse of data in SSBD, we examined time—dependent prolifer-
ation patterns during embryogenesis in several model organisms.
The data can also be reused for comparative analysis. For example,
we can directly compare the data from different laboratories when
the data pertains to the same biological phenomena in the same
model organism. Moreover, we can compare data obtained from
related or different species to reveal similar and different features
(Zhao et al., 2008). Furthermore, we might combine different types
of data such as cell morphology and protein activity data (Tsukada
et al., 2008) to explore the relationship between the underlying bio-
physical and biochemical changes.

We store simulation results within SSBD, enabling direct com-
parison with quantitative data extracted from biological experi—
ments. Comparison between the extracted data under gene
perturbation and the simulation results with perturbed parameters
may provide a mechanistic insight into gene function (Kimura and
Onami, 2007). However, it is difficult to determine what type of
simulation results should be stored and shared because an infinite
number of simulation results can be generated by varying each par—
ameter in a mathematical model. It may be appropriate to store and
share the computer programs and mathematical models that pro—
duce the results in the future. Meanwhile we plan to store simulation
results that are expensive to produce, for example, simulations that
take months to run on a supercomputer. These results cannot be eas—
ily reproduced in researchers’ individual laboratories.

Data quality control is a major problem in most biological data—
bases, and SSBD encounters the same problem. However, SSBD is
different from other databases such as genome and gene expression
databases because it also stores the original microscopy images from
which the quantitative biological dynamics data were obtained. By
visually checking the quantitative data with the original microscopy

image data, one can directly evaluate the quality of the quantitative
data. Online and offline visualization tools are available in SSBD,
enabling easy evaluation of the data quality.

Microscopy images stored in SSBD can provide new opportunities
for computational biologists, especially those in the field of bioimage
informatics. It is possible to develop new methods for extracting quan—
titative data of new biological objects from existing microscopy
images because these images often contain information that the ori-
ginal study did not focus on or utilize. Other possibilities include the
development of new or improved methods for extracting quantitative
data of the same biological objects examined in the original study. The
performance of these new methods can then be evaluated by compar—
ing their output with the data stored in SSBD. The Broad Bioimage
Benchmark Collection (BBBC; Ljosa et al., 2012) is a database for
storing annotated microscopy image sets for testing image—processing
methods. Each image set is provided with the corresponding quantita—
tive data such as contours of biological objects extracted by image
analysis. BBBC aims to improve image—processing algorithms for bio—
logical microscopy, whereas SSBD aims to provide quantitative biolo—
gical resources for bioinformaticians and computational biologists to
further advance biological research. It might be possible for the BBBC
and SSBD projects to collaborate and share a similar software plat—
form to enhance image—processing algorithms as well as to provide
quantitative data resources for biologists in the future.

We distributed an open—source version of SSBD, OpenSSBD, as a
software platform for managing quantitative biological dynamics
data. It has the essential functions of SSBD with a browser—based
simple interactive 4D viewer and the same REST API for accessing
data. Several groups have developed open—source platforms that can
manage numerical information of biological dynamics. The
OMERO platform was developed primarily to manage microscopy
images but it can also manage quantitative data pertaining to re—
gions of interest (ROIs) based on the 2D geometric models in OME
(Allan at al., 2012). However, a limitation of OMERO is that it can—
not use 3D geometric models such as spheres and faces in BDML.
The openBIS platform was developed to manage biological research
data, including microscopy images, and numerical information from
high—content screening (Bauch et al., 2011). However, openBIS is
not suitable for managing spatiotemporal information about biolo—
gical dynamics. All these other platforms do not provide an inter—
active 4D viewer for quantitative data because they are not
specialized for storing and sharing quantitative data. Therefore,
OpenSSBD is a unique software platform for managing quantitative
biological dynamics data.

OpenSSBD enables research groups to develop their own data—
bases to store and share their quantitative data. The distribution of
OpenSSBD could result in acceleration of data sharing with the ‘data
bazaar’ approach (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014), although it
could also lead to data scattering across the Internet. To avoid such
data scattering, a community—based effort for managing data integra-
tion is indispensable; for instance, a central database could be used to
store and share at least the meta—information about all the quantita—
tive data, including their download sites. If all quantitative data are
managed under the control of the community, data storage, process—
ing and download services can be dispersed throughout the databases
managed by research groups in the community. SSBD can be viewed
as a ‘data factory’ approach (Poldrack and Gorgolewski, 2014).
Currently, it uses a central database to store and share all quantitative
biological dynamics data created by the Japanese scientific commu—
nity. However, an international community—based effort is required
for efficient, effective and sustainable data sharing in the era of open
science.

To make the operation of SSBD sustainable for the future, we
plan to develop a registration system enabling researchers and users
to register and then upload their original data in BDML format. In
addition, the current policy of SSBD is to store only data published
in peer—reviewed journals to ensure that the data have been re—
viewed. This policy provides adequate confidence in the accuracy of
the data stored in SSBD. However, we are likely to change this pol-
icy in the future to accept quantitative data before publication. This
will allow authors to reference the data within their unpublished
paper and will allow editors and reviewers to access those data be—
fore publication. SSBD will be required to introduce the concept of
accession number, which provides a unique alphanumeric identifier
for each dataset. One possible solution is to use the bdmlID (Kyoda
et al., 2015). SSBD will also need a new attribute to denote the pub—
lication status of the data to ensure that users can have confidence in
the accuracy of the data. SSBD will play a larger role as a public re—
pository for quantitative biological dynamics data in the near future.

8 Conclusion

SSBD is a unique database that enables scientists in a wide variety of
fields to reuse the large amount of quantitative biological dynamics
data obtained from biological experiments and computer simula-
tions. SSBD will support, promote and contribute to advances in sys—
tems biology and various interdisciplinary research fields, and
facilitate data—driven biology.

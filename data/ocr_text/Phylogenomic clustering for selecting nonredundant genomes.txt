ABSTRACT

Motivation: Analyses in comparative genomics often require
non-redundant genome datasets. Eliminating redundancy is not as
simple as keeping one strain for each named species because gen-
omes might be redundant at a higher taxonomic level than that of
species for some analyses; some strains with different species
names can be as similar as most strains sharing a species name,
whereas some strains sharing a species name can be so different
that they should be put into different groups; and some genomes
lack a species name.

Results: We have implemented a method and Web server that clus-
ters a genome dataset into groups of redundant genomes at different
thresholds based on a few phylogenomic distance measures.
Availability: The Web interface, similarity and distance data and
R-scripts can be accessed at http://microbiome.wlu.ca/research/re—

1 INTRODUCTION

Genomic databases contain several sequenced strains for species
of high interest, whereas other species contain only one genome
and no evolutionarily close relatives WVu et al., 2009). These
biases might result in different qualities when predicting such
features as functional interactions by comparative genomics.
The problem has often been solved by using a measure of phylo-
genetic distance either directly as a score (e. g. Overbeek et al.,
1999) or for normalizing scores (e.g. Zheng et al., 2005). The
problem has also been solved by choosing single representatives
for particular clades (e.g. Moreno-Hagelsieb and Janga, 2008).
However, selecting representatives by species name can be prob-
lematic because strains of different species, for example
Escherichia coli and Shigella ﬂexneri, can be so evolutionarily
close that they should share their names, whereas strains of
single species such as Prochlorococcus marinus might be very
distant to each other (Moreno-Hagelsieb and J anga, 2008; van
Passel et al., 2006). Besides, some sequenced genomes do not
have a species name, and the level of acceptable similarity
among genomes for some applications might be lower than the
most common for species (Moreno-Hagelsieb and Janga, 2008).

The Genomic Similarity Score (GSS) and other phylogenomic
measures have been shown to concur with more computationally

demanding phylogenetic distances (Alcaraz et al., 2010; Kunin
et al., 2005). We have used GSS to produce datasets of
non-redundant genomes, maximizing the number of predicted
interactions by phylogenetic profiles (Moreno-Hagelsieb and
Janga, 2008), and other practical uses, such as displaying the
relationship between conservation of gene order and genomic
similarity (J anga and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2004). The datasets
were built by ordering the genomes available by importance
(e. g. Escherichia coli K12 would take priority because of its an-
notation quality), and then from largest to smallest. We would
then take the first genome in the list, and put any genome with a
GSS above a chosen threshold into the list of redundant gen-
omes. In the present work, we tested instead two clustering meth-
ods to group genomes, besides a couple variants of the GSS and
DNA signatures (Campbell et al., 1999). As other research
groups have asked us for lists of non-redundant genomes, here
we make them available to the wider community.

2 DATA AND METHODS

We used 2160 prokaryotic genomes available at the RefSeq
database (Pruitt et al., 2007) (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/
Bacteria/) by November 2012. Orthologs were reciprocal best
hits (RBH), as described previously (Moreno-Hagelsieb and
Latimer, 2008). We plan to update the data every 6 months.

We calculated the GSSs for each genome pair as follows
(Janga and Moreno-Hagelsieb, 2004; Moreno-Hagelsieb and
Janga, 2008):

n

compScorei
GSSa = — 1
1;: selfScorel- ( )

where compScore is the score of the alignment of protein i in
genome A against its RBH in genome B, and selfScore is the
score of the alignment of protein i against itself. Because
the selfScore for proteins in genome A might differ from the
selfScore for proteins in genome B, the ﬁnal GSSa is the average
of the calculation from the perspective of both genomes.

We also calculated two modiﬁed versions of the GSS:

I’l

compScorei/compA lignLengthl-
GSS = 2
b E selfScorei/SelfA lignLengthi ( )

 

i=1

Here the scores were normalized against the length of the
alignments. Because selfScores normally come from longer align-
ments than compScores, GSSb is larger than GSSa. The final
GSSb is the average of this calculation from the perspective of
both genomes under analysis.

Genomic Similarity Score

DNA Signature Distance

Fig. 1. Same-species clustering. Most of the same-species strains have GSSs >0.90 and DNA signature distances <0.25. GSSb concentrates most of the
same-species strains above the 0.9 score, and GSSC spreads them the most. DNA signatures produce the best clusters, as shown by agglomerative/divisive

coefﬁcients, with divisive clustering producing slightly better clusters

Instead of the selfScores of proteins ﬁnding RBH, we calculated
the total sum of selfScores of all proteins in the genome of ref-
erence. This has the effect of producing a smaller GSS. Again,
the ﬁnal GSSC was the average from the perspective of both
genomes under analysis.

We also clustered our genomes by di-, tri- and tetra-nucleotide
DNA signatures with Manhattan distances (Campbell et al.,
1999).

To build groups of redundant genomes, we used a hierarchical
clustering method (Hastie et al., 2009). We used 1 — GSS to
construct a dissimilarity matrix to run the clustering algorithms.

All computations were carried out using R (R Development
Core Team, 2012). The commands agnes and diana in the cluster
package were used to run the two main strategies in hierarchical
clustering: agglomerative or bottoms-up and divisive or
top-down, respectively.

To assess the clustering structures, we used the agglomerative/
divisive coefﬁcients deﬁned as 1 minus the average ratio of
dissimilarity of one unit to the cluster it ﬁrst merges with, to
the dissimilarity of its merging in the ﬁnal step of the algorithm.
A coefﬁcient close to 0 means that the algorithm did not ﬁnd a
natural cluster structure (the data consist of a single cluster),
whereas a coefﬁcient close to 1 means that clear clusters have
been identiﬁed.

3 RESULTS

GSSa and GSSb concentrate strains sharing species names (1103
strains in 224 species) into the 0.9—1.0 range of the GSS distri-
bution, whereas GSSC spreads several of them between the 0.7
and 0.9 range (Fig. 1). Thus, GSSC might be the least adequate
for clustering redundant genomes. Because DNA signatures are
faster to calculate than GSSs, we are starting to experiment with
DNA signatures for our work in comparative genomics. Thus,
we have also clustered our genome dataset based on di-, tri- and
tetra-nucleotide signature distances. DNA signature distances
among same-species strains concentrate at <0.03.

The divisive coefﬁcients were higher, and thus better, than the
agglomerative coefﬁcients using all three GSSs and DNA

signature distances (Fig. 1). The coefﬁcients using GSSC were
the lowest among all three GSSs for both algorithms, thus con-
ﬁrming that GSSC is the least adequate for clustering genomes.
However, DNA signature distances produced the best overall
clusters, with divisive coefﬁcients >0.95.

The appropriate threshold for deﬁning groups of redundant
genomes depends on the application (e.g. Moreno-Hagelsieb
and J anga, 2008). Thus, we recommend experimenting with
different thresholds. The Web site provides 10 thresholds per
measure that should sufﬁce for such experimentation. Should
other users prefer to experiment at thresholds other than those
provided through the Web site, we also provide the R scripts
used to derive these groups, and the pertinent distance/similarity
data. With some effort, inexperienced users would be able to
modify these scripts to obtain groups at other thresholds.
Finally, we also provide cluster ﬁles that can be read by software
for drawing and manipulating phylogenetic trees (Newick
format).

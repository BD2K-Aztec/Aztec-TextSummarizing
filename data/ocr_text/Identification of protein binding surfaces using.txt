ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ability to reliably predict protein—protein and
protein—ligand interactions is important for identifying druggable
binding sites and for understanding how proteins communicate.
Most currently available algorithms identify cavities on the protein
surface as potential ligand recognition sites. The method described
here does not explicitly look for cavities but uses small surface
patches consisting of triplets of adjacent surface atomic groups that
can be touched simultaneously by a probe sphere representing a
solvent molecule. A total of 455 different types of triplets can be
identified. A training set of 309 protein—ligand protein X-ray structures
has been used to generate interface propensities for the triplets,
which can be used to predict their involvement in ligand—binding
interactions.

Results: The success rate for locating protein—ligand binding sites
on protein surfaces using this new surface triplet propensities (STP)
algorithm is 88% which compares well with currently available grid-
based and energy-based approaches. Q-SiteFinder’s dataset (Laurie
and Jackson, 2005. Bioinformatics, 21, 1908—1916) was used to
show the favorable performance of STP. An analysis of the different
triplet types showed that higher ligand binding propensity is related to
more polarizable surfaces. The interaction statistics between triplet
atoms on the protein surface and ligand atoms have been used
to estimate statistical free energies of interaction. The AGStat for
halogen atoms interacting with hydrophobic triplets is —0.6 kcal/mol
and an estimate of the maximal AGStat for a ligand atom interacting
with a triplet in a binding pocket is —1.45 kcal/mol.

1 INTRODUCTION

Intermolecular interactions drive and control most biological
functions including, for example, signal transduction, transcription
and cell cycle events. An understanding of small molecule protein
recognition is also key to more effective medicinal chemistry
and design of tight binding drug—like ligands (Otvos, 2008;

White et al., 2008). The recent growth of information available in
structural databases and also of protein—ligand binding data (NIHl)
provides the required experimental data for the development of a
range of in silico algorithms; for example predicting ligand binding
sites (Capra et al., 2009), predicting absolute ligand binding free
energies (Mobley et al., 2007) and predicting protein—DNA binding
sites (Tsuchiya et al., 2005).

Proteins frequently play a role in multimer complexes and
communicate with a number of different partners, and there is a
growing body of structural information on such assemblies as the
spliceosome (Guo et al., 2009), the stressosome (Marles—Wright
et al., 2008), ribosome (Matsumoto and Ishida, 2009; Taylor et al.,
2009), ubiquitination pathways (Falbo et al., 2009), chaperone
complexes (Alexander et al., 2009) and transcription machinery
(Shechner et al., 2009). A picture is emerging in which even
small proteins are likely to have multiple non—overlapping docking
or binding sites which may be used in allosteric communication
networks. The possibility of being able to identify such allosteric
docking sites also opens up new opportunities in the ﬁeld of
drug discovery. Ligand speciﬁcity is a major problem in many
drug discovery projects where an enzyme active site is highly
conserved among a number of isoforms (e.g. protein kinases or
phosphatases). By blocking allosteric binding pockets, it may be
possible to target speciﬁc isoforms (or in the case of infection to
target species—speciﬁc ortholog proteins). Despite the expanding
experimental structural database of protein—ligand and protein—
protein interactions, experimental data are still insufﬁcient to
identify all potential binding sites that may be of biological relevance
to a particular protein target. Reliable computational prediction
methods to identify potential protein binding sites are therefore of
signiﬁcant current interest.

Several approaches have been developed to search for protein
binding surfaces. Geometry—based algorithms have been quite
successful. For example, PocketDepth (Kalidas and Chandra, 2008)
utilized the depth of pockets to predict the location of binding
sites and report to successfully predict 55% of ligands as ﬁrst rank
predictions. SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995) searches for cavities on
the surface of the protein and ﬁlls them in a GRID—like method
(Goodford, 1985) and then predicts the largest cavity to be the
ligand binding site. Searching for pattern similarity (sequence,
spatial or orientation patterns) of pocket—forming residues is an
alternative approach (Binkowski et al., 2005; Kleywegt, 1999;

Schmitt et al., 2002) which is generally faster since no energy
calculations are required. Molecular mechanics approaches (Huang,
et al., 2006) or other energy—based algorithms are also used as
exempliﬁed by the program eF—site (Kinoshita and Nakamura,
2003). A third class of algorithm analyses the chemical composition
of the protein assigning ‘Interface Propensities’ to indicate how
frequently particular residues appear in binding sites (Jones and
Thornton, 1996; Soga et al., 2007a, b).

We present an algorithm, surface triplet propensities (STP), which
is based on a score table giving the propensities of atom types of
surface atoms that appear in ligand binding sites. We have compared
the performance of STP with that of Q—SiteFinder (Laurie and
Jackson, 2005) and the method proposed by Morita et al. (2008),
and have shown that STP is able to predict the known binding
sites of 88.2% of the proteins under study (as one of the top three
predictions).

2 THE STP ALGORITHM

2.1 Classiﬁcation and triplet grouping of surface atoms

Protein atoms are classiﬁed into 13 atomic group types (Tsai et al.,
1999). This classiﬁcation is based on heavy atom types (carbon,
nitrogen, sulfur and oxygen), the number of covalently attached
hydrogen atoms and the number of all covalently attached atoms
(Table 1). Atomic groups on the surface of the protein are identiﬁed
by rolling a probe sphere (radius 1.4 A to simulate a water molecule)
over the protein. A triplet (triangle) is deﬁned as a group of three
surface atomic groups that can be simultaneously touched by the
rolling probe sphere. Neglecting handedness, there are a total of
455 distinct ‘triplet—types’ that can be generated from combinations
of the 13 different atom types.

2.2 The STP dataset

A dataset of 309 protein—ligand complex structures were selected
from the PDB, all of which were reﬁned using data to better than
1.7 A (Supplementary Table 1). For this study, ligands were deﬁned
as molecules having more than 10 carbon atoms which made at least
4 van der Waals interactions with the protein. The size of the ligands
in the dataset was also restricted such that the maximum separation

of any two atoms in the ligand was <23 A. No two proteins in this
test dataset have a sequence identity >50%.

For each of these 309 proteins, sets of triplets that are part of
the ligand binding surface were identiﬁed by calculating the surface
triplets of the ‘ligand removed’ protein structure and comparing them
with the protein triplets calculated using the protein—ligand complex.
Those triplets that are hidden from the probe sphere in the protein—
ligand complex are classiﬁed as belonging to the binding site. This
resulted in a total dataset of 1 223 008 surface triplets (average of
3958 triplets per structure), of which 34 288 are binding site triplets
(average of 111 triplets per structure).

2.3 Interface propensities

Interface propensities are used to quantify the relative abundance
of triplet types in binding sites. As a null hypothesis, we expected
that any given triplet type will occur in a binding site with the same
frequency as it would occur anywhere on protein surfaces. STP uses
propensity scores as a score table of occurrence of triplet types in
binding sites. Triplet propensities are calculated using Equations
1, 2 and 3 below and the values lie in the interval [—3.54, 5.16]
(Supplementary Tables 2 and 3). A logarithmic function is used to
calculate propensity values, so for example, a positive value of 3
for a particular triplet means that it is 23 times more abundant in
binding sites than anywhere on the surface.

ligand binding interfaces in the dataset; SurfCount(oz) is the count

and i spans the 455 triplet types.

2.4 Coloring the protein surface

Triplet propensity values can be mapped onto the surface of the
protein to provide a useful way of visualizing predicted binding
regions. Each surface atom is given a PatchScore which is deﬁned
as the average of all propensity scores of all the surface triplets
whose centroids are found within a certain distance from this atom.
This PatchScore would indicate the likelihood of this atom to belong
to a binding site based on information from its surrounding atomic
groups.

To give a visual output, PatchScores attributed to each of the
atoms are scaled from 0 to 100 (internal atoms are given a dummy
PatchScore) and stored in the B—Factor column of the PDB ﬁle.
Most molecular viewers are capable of using B—Factors (converted
from PatchScores) to color the protein structure from blue to red.
An example of this color—coded representation is given in Figure 1.

Fig. 1. FKBP12 (PDB id 2DG3) surface colored by STP: in this case, a
correct prediction of the binding site as shown by stick representation of
known ligand FK506.

The effect of different patch radii on the coloring pattern has been
examined (see Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). Increasing the patch
radius means including more triplets in the averaging process and
might lead to losing the signal of small binding sites since their atoms
are given scores incorporating triplets outside the binding site itself.
A patch radius of 7.5 A seems to give optimum results. This value of
7.5 A is also close to a maximum on the bell—shaped curve showing
the frequency of inter—triplet distances in protein ligand binding sites
(Supplementary Figs 1 and 2). The scaling 0—100 gives the best
visual representation for an individual protein; however, in order to
compare groups of proteins, there is an option in the STP program
to score multiple structures on the same scale.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Validation of the STP algorithm

A 10—fold cross—validation scheme was used. The training dataset
was divided into 10 random and mutually exclusive subsets. The
protein structures of each subset were tested against propensity score
tables that had been generated using a combination of the other nine
subsets. Each protein—ligand complex in the 10th (non—contributing)
subset was given two attributes based on this score table; the ﬁrst
attribute being the average propensity of all triplets found in the
binding site and the second attribute being the average propensity
of all triplets found on the entire protein surface of that protein.
This was carried out iteratively over each of the 10 subsets, giving
the complexes of each subset two attributes based on a score table
calculated from the union of the other nine. The distributions of these
two (unbiased) attributes were compared to assess STP’s capability
of giving high scores to binding site atoms (Fig. 2). The average
propensity of all triplets in the ligand—binding sites is higher (mean
0.32, SD 0.41) and can be distinguished from average propensities

for the entire surface (mean —0.3, SD 0.08). Figure 2B shows that the
binding sites have an average propensity greater than the average
propensity of all the triplets on the protein surface in ~96% of
the structures. The PDB structures in the dataset, along with their
average propensity of interface triplets and average propensity of
surface triplets, are given in Supplementary Table 1.

We examine the structures whose binding sites received an
average propensity lower than the average propensity of the entire
surface. In two cases (1GX5 and 1HYV), the structures were DNA—
binding proteins and it is likely that the ‘signal’ from the DNA
binding site was masking the small molecule binding sites used in the
test set. In other cases (llWH, 1MWQ and 107]), STP picked—out
the main binding site (the active sites of 1MWQ and 107] and the
Heme binding site of llWH) but failed to pinpoint the test binding
site.

3.2 The chemical nature of the triplets

The triplets in the dataset were sub classiﬁed into four categories
(Table 2). There are a total of 35 types of ‘hydrophobic triplets’

percentage composition of binding site triplets that are of a certain class and
dividing it by the percentage composition of all surface triplets that are of
that type

A value greater than one indicates a higher propensity for a certain triplet class to exist
in binding sites. Results show an overrepresentation of ‘hydrophobic and polar triplets’
and an underrepresentation of ‘mostly hydrophobic and mostly polar triplets’.

consisting of three hydrophobic (carbon) atomic groups. The 120
types of ‘polar triplets’ consist of permutations of three polar (N,
O and S) atomic groups. The 120 types of ‘mostly hydrophobic
triplets’ contain two hydrophobic atomic groups and the 180 types of
‘mostly polar triplets’ contain two polar atomic groups. The dataset
comprised 1 223 008 surface triplets out of which 34 228 belonged to
the binding sites. ‘Polar triplets’ show the highest average propensity
of 1.4 while ‘mostly hydrophobic triplets’ exhibit the lowest average
propensity of 0.4. ‘Hydrophobic and mostly polar triplets’ each
have an average propensity of 0.7. The distribution of individual
propensities around the average propensity (signaled by the standard
deviation) is similar in all categories (Supplementary Table 4).

We also calculate the ‘Triplet Class Propensity’ (TCP) by
calculating the percentage composition of binding site triplets that
are of a certain class and dividing it by the percentage composition
of all surface triplets that are of that type (Table 2). ‘Hydrophobic
and polar triplets’ show an overrepresentation with TCPs of 1.55
and 1.36, respectively, while ‘mostly hydrophobic and mostly polar
triplets’ show an underrepresentation with TCPs of 0.83 and 0.92,
respectively. The overrepresentation of ‘hydrophobic and polar
triplets’ indicates the key role of these triplets in protein ligand
binding, as they provide strong hydrophobic and polar interactions
with the ligand atoms to ensure a strong binding.

3.3 Recognition of ligand atoms by protein surface
triplets

We now study the interaction between the surface triplets and ligand
atoms, and search for preferences that some triplets might have
for different ligand atom types. Ligand atoms in the dataset are
classiﬁed according to the Tripos forceﬁeld deﬁnitions (Clark et al.,
1989). The protein—ligand dataset contains 20 ligand atom types
(Supplementary Table 5) grouped into the four classes: halogens,
hydrophobic, polar and water.

The interaction between surface triplets and ligand atoms is
quantiﬁed by measuring the distance between atoms and triplet
centroids. For each surface triplet, the closest ligand atom or
water molecule is recorded. If there are no atoms within a
distance of 4A, the closest atom type is recorded as ‘Empty’.
The interaction between each triplet class (hydrophobic, mostly
hydrophobic, mostly polar and polar) and each atom class (halogen,
hydrophobic, polar and water, empty) is studied. The observed

Fig. 3. The interaction preference of four ligand atom classes by
hydrophobic and polar triplet classes as calculated in Supplementary Table 6.
An interaction preference value greater than 1 indicates a favored interaction
while a value less 1 indicates a disfavored interaction. Empty class designates
a triplet that has no ligand atoms within 4A from its centroid. Results
show a strong afﬁnity for hydrophobic atoms and halogens to interact with
‘hydrophobic triplets’, as well as a high interaction preference for polar atoms
to interact with ‘polar triplets’.

frequencies of each interaction are recorded and compared with
the expected frequency (EF). The BF of a certain interaction
depends on the availability of a certain triplet class and a
certain atom class in the dataset. For example using data from
Supplementary Table 6, for the 206 halogen atoms and the 204 987
‘hydrophobic triplets’ in the database, the EF of ‘hydrophobic
triplet’: halogen interactions = (206 X 204987) / (1 223 008) (where
1 223 008 is the total number of interactions). A ﬁnal attribute
(interaction preference) is calculated by dividing the observed
frequency (OF) by the EF. An (OF/EF) value greater than 1 indicates
a favored interaction while a result less than 1 indicates a disfavored
interaction (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table 6).

The tripletzligand atom interaction data (Fig. 3 and Supplementary
Table 6) indicates that water molecules and polar ligand atoms have
a high propensity for ‘mostly polar and polar triplets’. Hydrophobic
ligand atoms and halogens have a high propensity for ‘hydrophobic
triplets’, but not for ‘mostly hydrophobic triplets’.

3.4 Comparison of STP and other ligand-binding site
prediction methods

For this set of validation studies, STP was used to score and rank
ligand binding sites of the 309 test structures. The binding site is
deﬁned as the set of atoms shielded from the water probe upon
binding to the ligand. PatchScores (Section 2.4) were calculated for
each atom associated with these binding sites. To make sure these
PatchScores avoid any bias, the 10—fold cross—validation scheme
(Section 3.1) was used again. In both experiments described below,

the PatchScores of surface atoms are scaled from 0 to 100 (zero
being the minimum and 100 being the maximum). A binding site is
then given an STP score equal to the number of atoms with a scaled
PatchScores over 70. Such atoms would be colored orange to red
and would be picked by eye as probable locations for a binding site
(Fig. 1).

3.4.] Comparison of STP with cavity size Cavities in protein
surfaces are often associated with ligand recognition or enzymatic
activity (Laskowski et al., 1996; Liang et al., 1998; Weskamp et al.,
2009) and several programs [SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995), Ligsite
(Huang and Schroeder, 2006) and PocketFinder (An et al., 2005;
Hendlich et al., 1997)] are available to identify such pockets. We
used SURFNET to calculate cavities for the 309 structures in our
dataset.

The atoms forming the cavities identiﬁed by SURFNET were
used as input to STP and the cavities were ranked according to the
number of high scoring atoms (PatchScore above 70 on a scale of
0—100) included. The performance of STP was then assessed by the
percentage of cases where the ligand binding site was STP ranked
in the top 1, 2 or 3 cavities. Figure 4 and Supplementary Table 7
show the results in comparison to ranking those cavities by size.

As shown in Figure 4, STP performs much better than just picking
the largest cavity on the surface. On average, SURFNET found 29
cavities on the surface of each protein. Of total, 83.7% of the ligand
binding sites were discovered in the top three cavities ranked by STP.
In conclusion, ranking clefts with STP is a better indicator of the
location of the binding sites than cavity size and the incorporation
of STP with SURFNET as depicted in this experiment gives a better
prediction of the binding site than using SURFNET on its own. In
cases where the clefts identiﬁed by SURFNET are much larger than
the ligand, information from STP can be used to help further pinpoint
ligands (Supplementary Fig. 3).

between a probe atom and the surface of the protein. We compared
the performance of STP against two such approaches; one
implemented in the program Q—site ﬁnder and the other described
in Morita et al. (2008). Both use high scoring probes as seeds for
a clustering process that attempts to locate the most energetically
favorable locus for a ligand.

A dataset of 34 structurally distinct proteins in the unbound state
which share structural similarity with 34 proteins in the ligand—
bound form was created by Laurie and Jackson (2005). This dataset
was used to check the performance of STP on proteins in the
unbound state. The unbound proteins were superimposed onto their
bound homologues. Ligands were then extracted to mark the binding
sites in the unbound proteins. The cavities on these proteins were
extracted with SURFNET (Laskowski, 1995) and then ranked by
STP. The binding site of one of these structures (1PHD) was an
internal binding site and was omitted from the analysis.

Figure 5 and Supplementary Table 8 summarize the performance
of STP in comparison with Q—SiteFinder, and the method created
by Morita et al. (2008). On average, 30% of the atoms within 5 A
of an experimentally veriﬁed ligand have a PatchScore of 70—100.
The binding site is located in the top predicted location by STP in
74% of the cases. This compares to 56 and 76% of the cases of the
other two methods (Fig. 5). The binding site is located in the top
two predictions in 85% of the cases (the comparable hit rates for the
other two approaches are 70 and 82%, respectively (Fig. 5).

STP succeeds at identifying ligand binding sites in the structures
3APP and 1BYA where both other methods failed (Morita et al.,
2008). In both these cases, the ligands are large and long and this
has hindered their prediction: the STP method is independent of
the ligand size. We can deﬁne a false positive as an experimentally
determined binding site which is not among the top three predicted
STP sites for that protein. There are four such structures out of the
total 34 in this test dataset (1NNA, 1PDY, 1HSI and 6INS). For
1NNA and 1PDY, their heteromerization sites dominated the signal
and were predicted over their small molecule ligand binding sites.
For 1HSI and 6INS, we can ﬁnd no documented function for the
predicted patches. Thus, the false positive rate from this dataset

is 2/34 = 5.9% (though we cannot exclude the possibility that these
predicted patches play an as yet undiscovered role in ligand binding).

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

The propensity of interaction of the different triplets with particular
atom types can be used to give apparent binding energies named
by Fersht and others (Fersht et al., 1993) as statistical free
energy (AGstat) values. For example, a non—bonded interaction
between a halogen—class atom and a ‘hydrophobic triplet’ has a
propensity of 2.7, where the interaction preference is calculated
as the OF/EF (Section 3.3 and Supplementary Table 6). This is
equivalent to saying that the frequency of interaction of a halogen
atom with a ‘hydrophobic triplet’ is about three times the expected
value. The empirical free energy difference that accounts for this
distribution can be calculated from: AGstatz—RT ln (OF/EF),
where R is the gas constant=1.9872 cal/deg/mol. This gives a
AGstat2—059 kcal/mol at 298K for the interaction of halogen
atoms with ‘hydrophobic triplets’. The other clear preference
for atom environment (Supplementary Table 6) is the interaction
between hydrophobic atoms and ‘hydrophobic triplets’ (interaction
preference 2.28) which gives a AGstat of —0.49 kcal/mol. The
preference of polar atoms interacting with ‘polar triplets’ is less
marked with a AGstat of —0.35 kcal/mol.

The frequency of occurrence of the 455 different triplet classes
occurring in the test dataset of 1.22 million triplets from the
surfaces of the 309 proteins has been tabulated (Supplementary
Tables 9 and 10). The most commonly occurring triplet types
are the ‘hydrophobic triplet’ (C3H1, C3H1, C3H1) with 951
occurrences and the ‘mostly polar triplet’ (C4H2, N3H1, OlH0)
with 927 occurrences. This analysis of protein surfaces provides a
quantitative measure of the role played by different triplet subclasses
in protein—ligand binding (Table 2). The highest propensity scores for
frequently occurring triplets are those of N3H1, N3H1, N4H3 (4.1),
C3H1, C3H1, S2H1 (3.5), C3H1, C4H2, S2H1 (3.2) and C3H0,
C3H0, C3H1 (2.7). It is notable that in each of these high propensity
triplets, the C and N atoms are mainly in the sp2 state, suggesting
that higher ligand binding propensity is related to more polarizable
surfaces.

The propensities deﬁned in Equation (3) for the 455 triplet
types (for being in a binding site) range from —3.54 to 5.16.
These propensity values can also be converted to statistical free
energy values: AGstat = —RT >< (propensity) >< ln(2), providing an
empirical measure of energy of interaction of a particular triplet type
with a ligand. These AGstat values range between —1.45 kcal/mol
and 2.12 kcal/mol (Supplementary Table 3). These statistical free
energy values provide a measure of the average empirical interaction
energy of a ligand (averaged over all ligand atoms and all atom types)
with a particular class of atom triplet. Interestingly, the strongest
AGstat value of —1.45 kcal/mol is very close to the maximum
afﬁnity value of —1.5 kcal/mol per ligand atom which was estimated
from an analysis of experimental binding data (Kuntz et al., 1999).

The incorporation of the propensity scores into the program STP
provides a very fast method of analyzing and visualizing protein
surface properties as a pattern of triplets with run—times for most
PDB protein structures under one second on a standard home
computer. The STP algorithm does not speciﬁcally search for protein
cavities on the surface but rather uses the distribution of triplets of
adjacent atomic groups. Such an approach gives STP the advantage

of being able to identifying shallow binding sites (Supplementary
Fig. 4). Most small molecule binding sites currently in the literature
are located in deep pockets. The combination of the STP algorithm
with more conventional cavity—ﬁnding programs may provide a new
approach for ﬁnding as yet uncharacterized druggable pockets.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Retroviral integration has been implicated in several
biomedical applications, including identification of cancer-
associated genes and malignant transformation in gene therapy
clinical trials. We introduce an efficient and scalable method for
fast identification of viral vector integration sites from long read
high-throughput sequencing. Individual sequence reads are masked
to remove non-genomic sequence, aligned to the host genome and
assembled into contiguous fragments used to pinpoint the position
of integration.

Availability and Implementation: The method is implemented in
a publicly accessible web server platform, SeqMap 2.0, containing
analysis tools and both private and shared lab workspaces
that facilitate collaboration among researchers. Available at
http://seqmap.compbio.iupui.edu/.

Retroviruses were ﬁrst characterized by their ability to cause
malignancy. Subsequently, retroviruses were identiﬁed that lacked
oncogenes but mediated malignancy through a process termed
insertional mutagenesis (IM). The molecular mechanisms of IM
are varied but most commonly involve upregulation of cellular
oncogenes in close proximity to the site of viral integration via
cis— and trans—effects of promoter and enhancer sequences within
the viral long terminal repeats (LTRs).

Because of IM effects, the mapping of retroviral integration
sites (RISs) has become a powerful tool for identifying cellular
oncogenes. Copeland and Jenkins (Buchberg et al., 1990; Copeland
and Jenkins, 1990) used retroviruses to identify potential oncogenes
by determining the site of viral integration in tumor tissues. This
work led to the development of a database of cancer—associated genes
(Akagi et al., 2004).

IM has also been associated with malignancy in the setting
of human gene therapy applications. While most gene therapy
trials have not been associated with the development of cancer, a
notable exception was the treatment of X—linked Severe Combined
Immuno—Deﬁciency (SCID—Xl), where several patients developed

a T—cell leukemia associated with vector integration near the proto—
oncogenes LMOZ, BMI] and CCNDZ (Hacein—Bey—Abina et al.,
2003, 2008). The US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) now
requires assessment of RISs for any human gene therapy trials
utilizing integrating vector systems (USDHHS, 2006).

In animal models and human clinical trials, retroviral transduction
targets millions of cells. As integration can occur throughout most
of the genome, the resulting cell populations can contain extremely
large, but unknown, numbers of RISs. Initial methods to identify
the RISs utilized PCR—based capture and ampliﬁcation assays that
were inefﬁcient and highly labor intensive. High—throughput next—
generation sequencing technologies have facilitated much more
efﬁcient identiﬁcation of RISs, which presents a new bioinformatics
challenge.

We (Peters et al., 2008) and others (Appelt et al., 2009; Giordano
et al., 2007) had previously developed web—based bioinformatics
tools that can facilitate identiﬁcation of RISs by mapping sequence
data obtained from Sanger sequencing technology, but the tools
are not sufﬁcient to quickly map and characterize RISs in high—
throughput methods. Here we introduce and explain our new
methodology for quickly mapping RISs to a reference genome from
extremely large datasets.

Depending on the frequency of insertion sites within the cell
population, and the number of samples run in parallel, there can
be anywhere from 50 to 5000—fold coverage of an individual
RIS within the reads generated from a single sequencing run.
SeqMap 2.0 provides a scalable method for sequence matching,
clustering and alignment, and also addresses challenges speciﬁc to
454 pyrosequencing data output, namely base stutter and redundant
coverage of each RIS.

The SeqMap 2.0 workﬂow has three stages: (i) sequence
processing, including identiﬁcation and masking of vector features
and distribution of sequence reads into multiplex identiﬁer
(MID)/barcode—speciﬁc groups; (ii) sequence clustering and
alignment; and (iii) data visualization and storage for further analysis
(Supplementary Fig. 1B).

SeqMap 2.0 is able to analyze data from the major PCR techniques
used in RIS analysis: ligase—mediated PCR (LM—PCR) (Smith,
1992), linear—ampliﬁcation—mediated PCR (LAM—PCR) (Schmidt
et al., 2003, 2007) and non—restrictive LAM—PCR (anAM—PCR)
(Gabriel et al., 2009); see Supplementary Material. Each individual
sequence read input to SeqMap 2.0 originates from an amplicon
with common features. From 5’ to 3’ is a sequencing adaptor, a
nucleotide bar code, viral LTR, RIS—ﬂanking genomic sequence,

linker cassette and another sequencing adaptor (Supplementary
Fig. 1A). This sequence processing phase removes these common
features to isolate the genomic portion of the read for clustering
and mapping, and to group reads belonging to individual samples
by bar code. First, each vector feature is matched to a database of
input sequence reads by pairwise alignment (Brudno, 2007). Each
base position in a vector feature mapping to a read is then masked.
Second, direct regular expression matching is used to ‘read’ the bar
code included in each sequence read. At this stage, reads are split into
coded groups for further analysis during the clustering and mapping
stages.

Redundancy in coverage necessitates the use of clustering to
group similar sequence reads before mapping and visualization.
Rather than using all—by—all pairwise alignment (Niu et al., 2010) or
clustering by alignment to dynamically created contiguous sequence
fragments, we cluster individual sequence reads by grouping those
reads mapped by Blat (Kent, 2002) alignment to an overlapping
region in the reference genome of the host cell. Each of the reads
mapping to a common genomic region is assigned into a cluster,

and all of the reads in each cluster are aligned by MUSCLE
(Edgar, 2004). A simple majority—voting algorithm is used to create
a consensus sequence of each RIS. This RIS sequence is then Blat
aligned back to the reference genome. Once a genomic location is
conﬁrmed, the exact position of the RIS is deﬁned by the genomic
position ﬂanking proviral LTR in the consensus sequence. Since
LTR regulatory regions may inﬂuence cellular genes within a large
distance of the RIS (Hargrove et al., 2008; Kustikova et al., 2005;
Lazo et al., 1990; Sadat et al., 2009), genes located within 300 kb
of the RIS are identiﬁed and reported.

The consensus sequence is used as the basis for visualizing each
RIS. We map the location of each vector feature, the bar code and
the genomic alignment to the sequence using BioPerl graphics. The
names of and distances to the closest genes in both Ensembl and
UCSC genome builds are reported, and the raw multiple sequence
alignment (MSA) of reads contributing to the RIS is linked (Fig. 1).

SeqMap 2.0 allows a user to: (i) upload full sets of 454
pyrosequencing reads, (ii) create savable lists of bar codes and
identiﬁers, (iii) create savable lists of vector features to mask from

each read and (iv) identify the appropriate reference genomes to
which RISs should be mapped. The rest of the process is completely
automated and data are returned to the user through secure login
to a saved workspace or by email. Investigators are also able to
use SeqMap 2.0 as a collaborative research tool by creating lab
workspaces accessible to multiple users. SeqMap 2.0 is available at

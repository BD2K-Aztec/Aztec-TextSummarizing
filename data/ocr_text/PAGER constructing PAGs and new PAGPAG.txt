Abstract

In this article, we described a new database framework to perform integrative "gene—set, net—
work, and pathway analysis” (GNPA). In this framework, we integrated heterogeneous data on
pathways, gnnotated list, and gene—sets (PAGs) into a PAG glectronic repository (PAGER). PAGs
in the PAGER database are organized into P—type, A—type and G—type PAGs with a three—letter—
code standard naming convention. The PAGER database currently compiles 44313 genes from
5 species including human, 38 663 PAGs, 324830 gene—gene relationships and two types of
3174323 PAG—PAG regulatory relationships—co—membership based and regulatory relation—
ship based. To help users assess each PAG’s biological relevance, we developed a cohesion
measure called @hesion @efficient (0000), which is capable of disambiguating between bio—
logically significant PAGs and random PAGs with an area—under—curve performance of
0.98. PAGER database was set up to help users to search and retrieve PAGs from its online web
interface. PAGER enable advanced users to build PAG—PAG regulatory networks that provide
complementary biological insights not found in gene set analysis or individual gene network
analysis. We provide a case study using cancer functional genomics data sets to demonstrate
how integrative GNPA help improve network biology data coverage and therefore biological in—
terpretability. The PAGER database can be accessible openly at http://discovery.informatics.

1 Introduction

 

To characterize complex patterns of genetic variations or RNN
protein expressions in surging Omics data sets, bioinformatics
researchers have developed new data analysis approaches—gene—set
analysis (Dinu et 61]., 2009; Nam and Kim, 2008) and network/
pathway analysis (Wu et 61]., 2012). When compared with individual
gene—based analysis approaches, “gene—set, network, and pathway
analysis” (GNPA) have the potential advantage of increasing results
reproducibility, model robustness, and data interpretability, while
reducing biases in noisy Omics experimental data (Khatri et 61].,
2012). GNPA is essentially an integrative analysis strategy that takes
advantage of a priori data structures acquired from many sources in:
e.g. gene ontology (GO) (Kim et 61]., 2007), pathways (Luo et 61].,

2009), gene/protein mutation or expression signatures (Chuang
et 61]., 2007; Zhang and Chen, 2013), chemical perturbations (Oprea
et 61]., 2007), metabolomics signatures (Xia and Wishart, 2010),
curated literature (Araki et 61]., 2012), computational predictions
(Nam, 2010) or public databases for gene—sets, molecular signatures
and pathway/network modules (Huang et 61]., 2012). Depending on
the pathway details, these analyses can take as minimal information
as possible, e.g. using gene list alone as in Gene—set Analysis (Dinu
et 61]., 2009), incorporating gene—set databases with expression rank
information as in Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramania et 61].,
2005), or take as much pathway/network interaction detail as pos—
sible, e.g. using pathway reaction/regulation details as in EnrichNet
(Glaab et 61]., 2012). For biomedical researchers, GNPA can

significantly enhance their ability to annotate genes from Omics
results (Ganter and Giroux, 2008), interpret heterogeneous genetic
study results (Hale et 61]., 2012), identify disease subtypes and pro—
gression (Hung, 2013; Zhang and Chen, 2013), select or prioritize
drug targets (Sivachenko and Yuryev, 2007) and understand
biological mechanisms (Chen et 61]., 2006; Murohashi et 61]., 2010).

Heterogeneous bioinformatics tools have been developed to
perform different aspects of GNPA Huang da et 61]., 2009).
Computationally, GNPA can be categorized into over—
representation analysis such as DAVID (Dennis et 61]., 2003), gene—
set scoring and ranking such as GSEA (Subramania et 61]., 2005),
multivariate machine learning Wu et 61]., 2010) and network topo—
logical analysis Martini et 61]., 2013). Common databases for GNPA
include: manually curated functional or phenotypic databases such
as Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) (Baxevanis,
2012), GAD (Becker et 61]., 2004)] and GO (Ashburner et 61]., 2000);
curated signaling and regulatory pathway databases such as
Reactome (Croft et 61]., 2011) and pathway interaction database
(PID) (Schaefer et 61]., 2009); comprehensive curated gene signature
database such as GeneSigDB (Culhane et 61]., 2012) and mSigDB
(Liberzon et 61]., 2011); or comprehensive integrated knowledge
repositories such as human pathway database (HPD) (Chowbina
et 61]., 2009) and PAGED (Huang et 61]., 2012). Recently, multi—scale
GNPA analysis tools such as Bioinformatics Enrichment Tools
(Huang da, et 61]., 2009), MetaNet (Parikh et 61]., 2012) and
EnrichNet (Glaab et 61]., 2012) have also been developed to explore
network topological structures between pathways and gene—sets
using a variety of computational strategies. However, even the most
popular tools such as DAVID and GSEA lack major functionality or
comprehensive data content found in other tools, forcing users to try
out several tools and combining findings manually.

In this work, we address the major challenge of constructing a
comprehensive database infrastructure in performing integrative
GNPA. The theoretical space of gene—sets for a given species with
N genes can be extremely large, i.e. 2N gene—sets. Based on our prac—
tical experience in building comprehensive pathway and gene—set
databases (Chowbina et 61]., 2009; Huang et 61]., 2012), different
data sources collected for integrated GNPA are often partially over-
lapping yet complementary to one another. For example,
GeneSigDB and mSigDB, two popular databases for Gene Set
Analysis, have virtually no overlapping gene—sets, in which an over—
lap is defined as two gene—sets sharing >80% genes. KEGG (Ogata,
et 61]., 1999) is the earliest effort in curating heterogeneous pathway
data sources; however, its coverage in gene—set is missing. G0 is
widely used for gene set analysis; however, tools performing
GO—based gene set analysis do not usually perform pathway/net—
work analysis. HPD (Chowbina et 61]., 2009), PAGED (Huang et 61].,
2012) and GeneSetDB (Araki et 61]., 2012) are among the first at—
tempts to integrate annotated gene lists from heterogeneous sources
into a unified database. Although these databases provide signifi—
cantly higher coverage of gene—sets and other annotated gene list,
these databases lack pathway/network interaction or regulatory re-
lationships details. In addition, increased gene—set coverage gives rise
to gene—set data quality concerns that must be addressed. There is no
report on how a new gene—set submitted from community users, e.g.
from WikiPathways (Pico et 61]., 2008), should be evaluated for its
quality before a database of gene—set should adopt it for data ana—
lysis. Moreover, there is a rising need to perform integrative network
analysis both within gene—sets and between gene—sets; therefore,
understanding how gene—sets relate to one another to build gene—set
to gene—set relationships has become critical for ongoing integrative
GNPA tools.

Our work has made the following contributions for future
GNPA. First, we defined a new concept—PAG, which stands for
Pathways (P—type), Annotated lists (A—type) and Gene—sets (G—type),
to integrate heterogeneous gene—sets, networks, and pathways into a
new comprehensive database called PAG Electronic Repository
(PAGER). Each P-type PAG refers to a connected set of molecules
(genes/proteins/metabolites), among which some detail of curated
mechanism of actions, e.g. protein interactions, reactions, or gene
regulations, are available (Biological Pathway, http://www.genome.
gov/27530687). Each A—type PAG refers to a curated list of genes/
proteins identified from a specific biological context, e.g. a shared
GO category or a shared protein family. Each G—type PAG refers to
a list of genes/proteins derived from any given high throughput
Omics experiment, e.g. functional genomics, under a shared biolo—
gical condition. PAGER collects and organizes 38663 PAGs—the
largest collection known to date—using a three—letter—code PAG clas—
sification system. Second, we developed a statistical measure called
@hesion @efficient (CoCo) to help assess PAG data quality—the
degree of biological relevance beyond random chance found among
genes curated in each PAG. We demonstrated that the CoCo score
can effectively separate biologically curated PAGs in PAGER from
randomly generated PAGs with an sensitivity:0.75 and specifi—
city: 0.94, covering >94% of all PAGs compiled into the PAGER
database, Third, we computed a novel type of relationship among
PAGs called regulatory PAG—PAG relationships (r—type) in addition
to computing the co—membership based PAG—PAG relationships
described in earlier work (Chowbina et 61]., 2009). These r—type
PAG—PAG relationships (11: 65 872 for human) significantly com-
plement the single gene regulatory relationships that are known
prior to this work (11 : 22 127 for human). The PAGER database is
accessible at http://discovery.informatics.iupui.edu/PAGEIU and the
database content for PAGs may be downloaded for separate GNPA
tools such as GSEA.

2 Methods

2.1 Source data collection and preprocessing of PAGs

In the PAGER database, we compiled PAGs from the following
data sources (for download date and description details, refer to

which we collected 202 public validated pathways; Reactome
(Croft et 61]., 2011), from which we collected 651 peer—reviewed
pathways via the HPD (Chowbina et 61]., 2009); BioCarta

were all mapped to NCBI official gene symbols (Brown et al.,
2015

In the PAGER database, we also constructed a special type of
PAGs, ‘singleton PAGs’ (sPAG), to refer to PAGs consisting of only
one gene. sPAGs are essential for constructing PAG—PAG relation-
ships (to be described later). The final PAGER database consists of
19 772 sPAGs, which represent all sPAGs from the underlying sour-
ces and an additional 15 161 human genes from the reviewed subset
of the UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProt, 2013). In the PAGER web
database, we mask out these sPAGs by default to avoid causing con—
fusions to users who are primarily interested in performing analysis
with regular PAGs (n = 18 607, among which 16 125 are for
human).

A total of 324 830 gene—gene relationship data are also imported
into the PAGER database from various data sources. In total,
205 185 molecular association data are derived from the STRING
version 9.1 (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) database after removing those
with confidence score of 800 or less. A total of 93 713 human pro—
tein—protein interaction (PPI) data are derived from the HAPPI data—
base (quality 2 3—star ratings) (Chen et al., 2009). A total of 25 932
gene regulation data are derived from the TRANSFAC (Wingender
et al., 1996) (with quality defined as having five—binding sites or

databases. The PPI data are used to build PAG biological relevance
measures. The gene regulation data are used to construct regulatory
PAG—PAG relationships later.

We follow the PAG ID standard naming convention as shown in
Figure 1. Every PAG begins with a three—letter—code followed by six
digits. The first letter position is used to signify the PAG data type
category. The second letter position is used to signify the PAG deriv-
ation category. The third letter position is used to signify PAG rela-
tionship details. The human—readable naming convention may make
it easy for end users to understand how the PAGs are constructed.

2.2 Defining CoCo measures to evaluate the biological
relevance of each PAG

To evaluate the biological relevance of PAGs, we developed three
PAG cohesion measures, i.e. Cohesion by Interaction enrichment
(CoI), Cohesion by Triangle enrichment (CoT) and CoCo.
Conventional tests such as chi—square, hypergeometric test or
Fisher’s exact test have all been used to assess gene—set enrichment
results. However, none of these statistical tests may generate true
statistical P—values in practice (Huang da et al., 2009). Therefore,
for simplicity of calculation, we calculate all three cohesion meas—
ures based on signed probability mass function of hypergeometric
distribution. Mathematical notations are defined as the following:
H is the set of genes in the reference PPI database; i and j are PAG
indexes; I,- or I,- is the set of PPIs in PAG,- and PAG], respectively; In
is the set of all PPIs in the referenced database; T,- or T,- is the set of
PPI triangles in PAG,- and PAG], respectively given In; TH is the set
of all PPI triangles in TI. For an overview of how each cohesion
measure is calculated, refer to the illustrated example shown in
Figure 2.

2.2.1 Col definition

We developed C01 to measure the statistical significance of observ—
ing a given number of PPIs among all genes within a PAG. We define
C01 from a hypergeometric probability mass function as:

(K) (N ‘ K)
. . k K k n — k
CoI(1) — (Slgl’l  >< —log ﬁ
71
in which N :  ><  — 1))/2 is the number of theoretical PPIs
in TI, K=|IH| is the number of actual PPIs in the referenced

database, 11 : (|PAG_i| >< (|PAG_i| — 1))/2 is the theoretical num-
ber of PPIs inside PAG i, and k : |I,-| is the number of actual PPIs
inside PAG i. The sign function compares the expected PPI count
ratio K/N and PAG i’s PPI count ratio le/n. It returns 1 for over—
representation if the PPI count ratio inside PAG i is more than the
expected ratio and returns —1 for under—representation if the
interaction ratio inside PAG i is less than the expected ratio. For
PAGs containing no PPIs, we will not calculate a C01. A high posi—
tive C01 score implies that genes inside the PAG are strongly linked
while a high negative C01 score implies that genes inside the PAG
are impossibly linked. Randomly generated PAGs should have a
mean C01 close to 0.

2.2.2 CoT definition

We developed CoT to measure the statistical significance of observ—
ing a given number of triangles (PPIs forming a connected loop with
three exact nodes/edges) among all genes within a PAG. Similar to
C01, CoT is also calculated using the same hypergeometric distribu—
tion probability mass function (hence we will not repeat here)
but with different parameters for counting PPI triangles instead:
N :  ><  — 1) x  — 2))/6 is the number of theoretical
triangles in TI, K : |TH| is the number of actual triangles in the refer—
enced database, n : (|PAG_i| >< (|PAG_i| — 1) x (|PAG_i| — 2))/6 is
the theoretical number of triangles inside PAG_i, and k : |T,-| is the
number of actual triangles inside PAG_i. When compared with C01,
it has similar characteristics for highly positive CoT or highly nega-
tive CoT cases. For PAGs containing no PPIs, we will not calculate a
CoT. A high positive CoT score implies that genes inside the PAG are
strongly linked while a high negative CoT score implies that genes
inside the PAG are impossibly linked. Randomly generated PAGs
should have a mean CoT close to 0.

2.2.3 CoCo definition

We define CoCo : C01 —1— CoT for PAGs that contain at least one PPI
triangle, and CoCo : C01 for PAGs that contain no PPI triangle but
at least one PPI. When compared with C01 and CoT, the combined
CoCo score has similar characteristics for highly positive CoCo or
highly negative CoCo cases. For PAGs without valid calculated C01,
there will not be a CoCo score. In practice, since we used a high—
coverage PPI database (the HAPPI database), the portion of PAGs
without any PPIs within is relatively low.

2.2.4 Performance evaluations

To compare and evaluate the performance of three cohesion meas—
ures, we plot Receiver Operator Characteristic (ROC) curves for
each of the measures, CoI, CoT, and CoCo. To create the positive
set, we use true PAGs (size>1 for C01 and size>2 for CoT or CoCo)
from the PAGER database. To create the negative set, we substitute
all genes in each PAGi with genes randomly picked from the
PAGER database. After all the cohesion measures are calculated, we
calculate true positive rate (true positives over all positives cases)
and true negative rate (true negatives over all negatives cases) for
each possible cohesion measure threshold that exists in the data be—
fore plotting them on the ROC curve.

2.3 Inferring PAG—PAG relationships

We computationally derive two types of PAG—PAG relationships:
co—membership based PAG—PAG relationships (m-type) and regu—
latory PAG—PAG relationships (r—type). These two types of PAG—
PAG relationships may be calculated by Fisher’s exact test (Al—
Shahrour et al., 2004; Li et al., 2008; Parikh et al., 2012) using a

2x2 contingency table. In this study, however, we used

hypergeometric distribution probability mass function

K)(N—K

k

pmf(k|N,n,K)=# instead to score each PAG—PAG relation—

ship. Mathematical notations are defined as the following: Q is the
number of genes covered in PAGER, R_in,- is the set of gene regula—
tions coming into genes in PAG,-, R_out,- is the set of gene regula—
tions coming out from genes in PAG,-, R,_>,- is the set of gene
regulations from genes in PAG,- to genes in PAG], R,<_>,- is the set
of gene regulations from genes in PAG,- to genes in PAG,- if and
only if the genes belong to PAG,- ﬂ PAG).

2.3.1 Inferring m-type PAG—PAG relationships

We define the m—type relationship as the significance of observing
the number of shared genes among PAGi and PAGj given the gene
regulation data related to the two PAGs, or membership strength
score in short. The hypergeometric distribution parameters for m—
type relationships are defined as: N = Q, K : |PAGi|, n : |PAG]—| and
k = |PAGi ﬂ PAGj|.

2.3.2 Inferring r-type PAG—PAG relationships

We define the r—type relationship from PAG,- to PAG,- as the
significance of observing the number of gene regulations from genes
in PAG,- to genes in PAG], excluding the genes in PAG,- ﬂ PAG], or
regulatory strength score in short. The hypergeometric distribu—
tion parameters for m—type relationships are defined as:
N: |R_in,-| —I— |R_out,-| —I— |R_in,-| —I— |R_out,-| — |R,-_>,-| is the total num—
ber of gene regulations in PAG,- and PAG], K: |R_out,-|, n : |R_in,-|
and k : |R,-_>,-| — |R,~<_>,-| is the number of gene regulation from genes
in PAG,- to genes in PAG], excluding the genes in PAG,- ﬂ PAG).

2.4 Developing the web application and user interface
We developed a web interface for the PAGER database, which is
located at http://discovery.informatics.iupui.edu/PAGEIU, for
users to retrieve PAGs and PAG—PAG relationships with gene or
keyword based queries. We used PHP5 and Codeigniter version
2.1.3 (EllisLab, 2014) as the web presentation framework and
Oracle 11g as the database backend. Real—time calculation of
hypergeometric probability mass function was implemented with
PDL (Meagher et al., 2013), a PHP library for statistics.
Cytoscape.js (http://js.cytoscape.org), an open—source graph li-
brary, and j Query were used to visualize gene and PAG networks.
D3.js (http://d3js.org/) was used to perform matrix visualizations.
We also implemented advanced features such as batch gene search,
matrix or network visualization, gene or PAG transaction manage—
ment to hold temporary user—selected contents, and data bulk
download.

2.5 Case study: application of PAGER in myeloid—derived
suppressor cells expression data analysis

Myeloid—derived suppressor cell (MDSC) microarray data analysis
between tumor and normal control conditions were performed at
Purdue University Center for Cancer Research. The study aims to es—
tablish a hypothesis on what factors were essential in promoting
MDSC during cancer progression to transition from tumor—suppres—
sor cells to tumor—helper cells. We collected tumor MDSC at the
peritoneal cavity (T0) and compared control MDSC at the spleen
(N0) of inﬂamed mice. Using the pulsed electroacoustic method, we
extracted two cell sub—populations: CD11b—I— Gr—1low (PC Glow)
and CD11b—I— Gr—1low (Sp Glow). Standard differential expression

analysis of individual genes were performed using SAM (Tusher
et al., 2001). After the data analysis using pmf< 0.05 as the filter,
we set the minimum log fold—change of 2.5 to select 1105 differen—
tially expressed genes (N0), which includes 576 over—expressed
genes (N—I—) and 529 under—expressed genes (N—).

To generate an MDSC tumor versus control (T0 versus N0)
gene regulatory network, we queried the N0 gene—set against the
available gene regulation data in the PAGER database to obtain
the seeded gene regulatory network. In addition, we queried N—I—
and N— gene—sets against the PAGER database to obtain N—I— asso—
ciated PAGs and N— associated PAGs. Using the r—type PAG—PAG
regulatory relationships in PAGER, we also acquired the MDSC—
specific network.

3 Results

3.1 An overview of summary statistics of the new
PAGER database

From Table 1, we can obtain several data characteristics for the new
PAGER database. First, there are 38 379 unique PAGs, which con—
sists of 19772 sPAGs and 18607 mPAGs (regular PAGs) with a
size variation ranging between 1 and 4939 (refer to Supplementary
Fig. S1 for additional details of PAG size distribution categorized
into different data sources). When compared with MSigDB—the
largest gene—set database prior to this publication, PAGER repre-
sents a 181% increase of gene—set data coverage. In addition, we
noticed an unusual spike in the size distribution for data derived
only from MSigDB (with PAG sizes in the 200—212 range,
Supplementary Fig. S1). This suggests potential PAG data curation
size bias, i.e. taking only the top 200 genes from an expression sig-
nature, in the popular MSigDB. Second, there is a high percentage
of PAGs determined to be biologically relevant as determined from
the cohesion measure, CoCo score. In total, 14 701 (79%) of the
18 607 mPAGs are computed with a valid CoCo score and 13 856
(94%) of these mPAGs also have a CoCo score> 1. This finding
suggests fairly high biological relevance in the majority of PAGs that
we integrated into the PAGER database. Third, we also noticed that
PAGs are more likely to overlap with each other than to regulate on
one another. In the data statistics table, there 3 101499 m—type
PAG—PAG relationships—a number significantly higher than that of
the total 72 824 r—type PAG—PAG relationships identified.

3.2 Cohesion scores to classify PAGs based on
biological relevance

We evaluated PAG classification performance (biological relevant
YES/NO classes) using three different PAG cohesion measures, i.e.
CoI, CoT and CoCo. First, using the ROC curve (Fig. 3), we
observed that all these measures can classify true PAGs from ran-
domly generated PAGs effectively. The area—under—curves (AUCs) of
classification performance for balanced positive class (integrated
PAGs from the PAGER database) and negative class (randomly
generated PAGs) are 0.96, 0.95 and 0.98 respectively for each of the
cohesion measures CoI, CoT and CoCo. Second, we compared the
positive class with the negative class using these cohesion measures’
score distributions. Measurement score distributions between
samples from the two classes are statistically significant at P—values
of 8.5e—138 (for C01), 3.0e—10 (for CoT) and 2.4e—62 (for CoCo),
respectively, when two—sample t—test analysis is used. Third, we
observed variable effects between PAG size and cohesion measure—
ments’ classification performance. For example, the AUC perform-
ance using CoT is slightly better than that for C01 among small

PAGs (n< 100), based on Table 2. These observation justifies the
use of the combined score CoCo whenever CoT may be calculated
(size>2 and minimal PPI triangle : 1).

To decide the threshold of high informative PAG, we choose the
CoCo score as threshold to minimize the sum of false positive and
false negative. We observe the threshold of 1 has the minimum sum
of false positive and false negative counts equal to 2490
(Supplementary Table S2) with the false negative rate equal to 0.057
and the false positive rate equal to 0.252. We also show the PAG
coverage decreases when the threshold increases, which means we
need to balance the precision and PAGs recall (Supplementary Fig
S2 and Supplementary Table S3).

3.3 PAG—PAG regulatory relationship network
characterization

The PAG regulatory network in PAGER has the following charac—
teristics. First, the network only connects a small portion of all
PAGs. The network only covers 3304 regular PAGs, or 20.49% of
the human regular PAGs, and contains 6783 directed PAG—PAG
regulation; therefore, on average each PAG has the regulatory de—
gree of 2.05. Second, the regulatory network is well—connected. This
network has 39 connected components; however, the largest con—
nected component covers 3236 PAGs, or 97.94% of the network
size. Third, the PAG regulatory network node degree strictly follows
the power law, achieves R220.884 for in—degree analysis, and
R220.855 for out—degree analysis. Due to the sparsity of high-
quality PAG-PAG regulatory relationships identified in PAGER, we
therefore suggest using both gene regulatory relationship data from
conventional methods and new PAG—PAG regulatory relationship
data from PAGER for GNPA.

3.4 Web interface to access PAGER data

The PAGER web interface provides four basic features: basic search,
advanced search, matrix and network view, and data download.
The basic search allows the users to enter terms, such as a disease

name or a gene symbol. The advanced search allows the users to
enter a list of gene symbols. The users can decide specific options to
filter out poor quality PAGs. When the users enter a list of terms,
PAGER returns genes and PAGs associating with this list. When the
users search a list of genes, PAGER returns the related PAGs, show—
ing PAGs’ gene membership, cohesions, p—value and FDR. The users
can construct, expand both m—PAG and r—PAG networks and com—
pare PAGs using a similarity matrix view. The users can sort the ma—
trix view by name, frequency. The site also allows a user to
download the data used to construct the networks and images of the
matrix. Details on what features the web application provides and
how to use them are provided in Supplementary File S1.

3.5 PAGER analysis of MDSC gene expression data

MDSCs have been identified in most cancer patients and tumor mice
models based on their ability to suppress T—cell activation (Ostrand—
Rosenberg and Sinha, 2009). MDSC are induced by tumor—secreted
factors, many of which are known pro-inﬂammation markers. In
this study, we performed a functional genomics study using micro—
arrays, by comparing MDSC at tumor site versus at control spleens,
to identify detailed molecular mechanisms that trigger the MDSC’s
immunity inhibition functions. To compare the effectiveness of per—
forming integrative GNPA with the new PAGER database, we set
up a control experiment to examine the gene regulatory network
that can be constructed following microarray data analysis. Among
the 1105 differentially expressed genes, there are only 256 genes
(23% coverage) with direct gene regulation relationships between
them in the MDSC gene regulatory network (Table 3 and
Supplementary Fig S3). On the other hand, there are 972 genes
(88% coverage) enriched in 91 connected mPAGs through newly
defined r—type PAG—PAG relationship in the MDSC PAG regulatory
network. Although one can try to characterize the MDSC—derived
tumor versus control (TvN) individual gene biomarkers from the
gene regulatory network formed within the 256 differentially ex-
pressed genes, the poor network data coverage due to limited avail—
ability of gene regulation data can lead to significant bias in the
knowledge discovery process (refer to Table 1 for summary statis—
tics). From the new PAGER database, we are able to identify 91 en—
riched mPAGs (13 up—regulated PAGs and 78 PAGs, all of which
have CoCo score > 1), the majority of which come from diverse data
sources. Although conventional GNPA relies on gene—set enrichment
analysis, we demonstrate how to perform multi—scale integrative
GNPA, using regulatory PAG—PAG network analysis (Fig. 4). In the
figure, we show each PAG as a node of different sizes and shapes,
with size proportional to the CoCo score (in log scales) for each
PAG. The MDSC inflammatory regulatory PAG network shows a
significantly suppressed PAG—FEX001153 (size 11:45 68)—which
includes many genes responsible for immunity functions. Upstream
of the immunity—suppressed process are many activated cell growth
and differentiation signal molecules, such as BCL2L1, a potent in—
hibitor of cell death; FGFR1, Tyrosine—protein kinase that acts as
cell—surface receptor that can regulate embryonic development, cell
proliferation, differentiation and migration; ID1, which regulates a
variety of cellular processes, including cellular growth, senescence,
differentiation, apoptosis, angiogenesis and neoplastic transform—
ation; and AHR that are involved in cell—cycle regulation.
Downstream of the immunity-suppressed process are many proc-
esses responsible for cell differentiation (e.g. FEX00813) and cancer
progression (e.g. FEX002152 and EPHA2), and chemokine signal-
ing (e.g. CCR5). GEX001173, the closest downstream PAG of
FEX001 15 3, is a nephrolithiasis—related gene set acquired from

4 Conclusion

In this work, we presented a new conceptual framework that unifies
pathways, annotated gene lists, and gene-sets into a standardized
representation called PAGs. We constructed a comprehensive data
repository called PAGER for PAG data from heterogeneous sources
including ontology, pathway, omics, and public databases. The new
PAGER database collects 80% more PAG data than that of the
popular MSigDB database. We showed that a significant benefit for
using PAGER data is the benchmarking of each PAG with cohesion
measures—scores that can help evaluate the biological relevance of
all genes/proteins in a given PAG in high confidence. To address the
practical challenges of performing GNPA, we define new PAG—PAG
relationships as m-type for those with shared members between
PAGs and t-type for those with strong supporting gene regulatory
relationships pointing from one PAG to the next. We demonstrated
through an integrative cancer genomics study how integrative multi-
scale GNPA could help gain significant biological insights of the
Omics data.

We expect future researchers in the field to focus on addressing
several key questions related to PAG data management and integra-
tive GNPA. First, there should be sufficient focus on curating PAGs
with rich meta-data, e.g. information on individual genetic
background, life-style, and electronic medical records. Second, there
should be comprehensive linking of genomics and functional
genomics data from public databases into PAG data structure.

Therefore, researchers may further investigate the biological rele-
vance of enriched PAGs and regulatory PAG relationships derived
from GNPA. Last, we expect to develop novel literature mining and
crowd sourcing within the biomedical research community to con-
tinue rapid extension of data for the PAGER database.

ABSTRACT

Summary: In recent years, the number of knowledge bases
developed using Wiki technology has exploded. Unfortunately, next
to their numerous advantages, classical Wikis present a critical
limitation: the invaluable knowledge they gather is represented as
free text, which hinders their computational exploitation. This is in
sharp contrast with the current practice for biological databases
where the data is made available in a structured way. Here, we
present WikiOpener an extension for the classical MediaWiki engine
that augments Wiki pages by allowing on-the-fly querying and
formatting resources external to the Wiki. Those resources may
provide data extracted from databases or DAS tracks, or even results
returned by local or remote bioinformatics analysis tools. This also
implies that structured data can be edited via dedicated forms.
Hence, this generic resource combines the structure of biological
databases with the flexibility of collaborative Wikis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biological databases are essential tools for many biologists in all
research areas. The number of these online resources is constantly
increasing. Indeed, as an illustration, the issue of the Nucleic Acids
Research journal dedicated to biological databases has already
described about 1200 online repositories which only represent a
small part of all the existing ones (Galperin and Cochrane, 2009).

Maintenance is the key issue for many biological databases.
Indeed, with the large number of new papers published each day,
it is increasingly difﬁcult to efﬁciently update smaller databases,
maintained by a small group of people. Moreover, often small
databases will stop being maintained when the project funding
comes to its end or when the main curator leaves the lab.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
lThe authors wish it to be known that, in their Opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First authors.

A new way to tackle this problem consists in building
collaborative databases which are curated by all the people in
the ﬁeld wanting to share their knowledge with the community
according to their area of expertise. The implementation of some
of these databases is based on the MediaWiki engine which is used
in well—known collaborative projects, such as Wikipedia. Among
these, in biology, we can cite the cases of WikiPathways for the
curation of biological pathways (Pico et al., 2008), Proteopedia,
for 3D structures of biochemical compounds (Hodis et al., 2008)
or Metabolomicsjp for the annotation of metabolites (Arita, 2009).
MediaWiki presents numerous advantages: fast and easy set up of a
new collaborative database, user rights and statistics management,
simple and appealing for users, etc.

However, MediaWiki in itself presents some limitations. First,
the web site can only be based on one unique underlying database.
Second, classically, the data of this database are not structured and
are generally represented in a free text format, which makes difﬁcult
any query different from the built—in queries. These limitations are
somewhat contradictory with the current common sense practice
for biological databases where the available data come from well—
structured repositories. Moreover, a lot of web accessible biological
databases mainly consists of a set of entries extracted from relational
database tables. Third, a lot of online biological databases offers
bioinformatics tools to the scientiﬁc community (e.g. BLAST),
which is a functionality not supported by the MediaWiki engine.
These limitations prevent from using only MediaWiki to develop
collaborative databases that would be comparable with current
biological databases. Some solutions, including Semantic web
strategies, have already emerged to tackle these limitations. We
followed a totally different direction by developing WikiOpener, an
extension to MediaWiki, not linked to concepts and closer to the
original Wikipedia look and feel.

2 APPROACH

MediaWiki extensions are pieces of code that allow the users to adapt
the engine to their needs by improving the existing functionalities
or by adding new ones. With WikiOpener, the inclusion of external
data in a wiki page is done by including a given tag within the page.
The options within this tag specify (i) which function (WikiOpener
component) should be called to obtain the data for inclusion into the
Wiki page and (ii) the way this data have to be displayed on the web
page (layout which is being stored as another article of the Wiki)
(Fig. 1, Supplementary Fig. 1).

Fig. 1. WikiOpener principle. Classically, the wiki data are extracted by the
MediaWiki engine from a unique database which also, e. g. stores the usage
statistics, and the user rights management. WikiOpener allows the extraction
and edition of data from any other external resource. The way to extract the
data is encoded in the components and the layout of the WikiOpener elements
(data, forms) are stored as simple Wiki pages.

Furthermore, our extension allows the automatic inclusion of
data on predeﬁned pages. The inclusion can be done on every
page, on a given type of page (namespace), or on a particular page
and can consist of simple Wiki text, data obtained from external
databases or web services, or even results of analysis tools. As a
consequence, if a page has not yet been manually created by the
Wiki contributors, external data or tools may already ﬁll it. For
example, a Wiki article about a gene can immediately be preﬁlled
with data extracted from any resources (publicly available database,
DAS server, user own resources). A page can thus consist of results to
any queries preformatted by the wiki administrator. The possibility
to run analysis tools on the ﬂy and display their results within the
pages of the Wiki is of great interest as it can be used to propose
bioinformatics tools (BLAST, network analysis, gene prioritization,
etc.), which is common in biological databases.

Edition of external data had to be as transparent and intuitive as
the edition of Wiki pages. To this end, WikiOpener allows the user
to enter and modify data through standard web forms (text ﬁelds,
pop up menu, etc.). WikiOpener components can then make use of
the submitted data to update the external databases. The ﬁelds and
the layout of the forms are stored as Wiki pages.

3 APPLICATIONS

We have currently used the WikiOpener extension for the
development of two biological databases: CHDwiki devoted
congenital heart defects (http://homes.esat.kuleuven.be/~bioiuser/
chdwikil; Barriot et al, 2010, Supplementary Fig. 2) and YTde
(Van Belle and Andre, 2001) is dedicated to the classiﬁcation
of the yeast membrane transporters (http://homes.esat.kuleuven
.be/ytpdbl). Any expert in these ﬁelds is welcome and is able to
contribute after registration (simple request to the respective web
site administrator).

For testing purposes, we designed a demo wiki running
WikiOpener which can be freely edited (http://homes.esat.kuleuven
.be/~bioiuser/demo_wiki/).

4 CONCLUSIONS

To solve the recurring maintenance problem of many specialized
databases, many research teams choose to open their database to
all specialists of the ﬁeld using collaborative databases or Wikis
(Hu et al, 2008). To circumvent the limitations inherent to the wiki
structure, some extensions to the MediaWiki engine have already
been proposed using the Semantic Web: a general format for data
interchange that provides curators with a standardized framework
allowing data to be integrated and reused across disciplines.
Semantic Web advantages are obvious: unique names for biological
entities and consistent standards for knowledge representation and
processing. Such standards simplify integration of web resources
as they can be queried the same way by linking non—ambiguous
concepts and that would lead to a federated wiki landscape.
Bioinformatics query systems in diverse ﬁelds have started to use
this technology [e.g. WikiProteins (Mons et al, 2008)].

Although WikiOpener as such does not contribute directly to
the uniﬁcation of different biological web resources, it offers a
novel strategy allowing the integration of relational databases (as
well as any other data source) to a wiki. Indeed, wikis running
Wiki Opener can display and edit both wiki unformatted and formated
data coming from external resources and create pages automatically.
It can also thus query Semantic Web triple stores using dedicated
components. Moreover, WikiOpener is not only limited to the
querying and ﬁlling of relational databases but can also be used
for the integration of tools in the wiki and can thus be used in
combination with Semantic Web technologies. In fact, it realizes
a practical solution to integrate any external systems.

This extension has already been used sucessfully for two different
web knowledge bases and we are quite conﬁdent that it is of interest
to the scientiﬁc community intending to share their data in a user—
friendly way.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Among classical methods for module detection,
SpaCEM3 provides ad hoc algorithms that were shown to be
particularly well adapted to specific features of biological data:
high-dimensionality, interactions between components (genes) and
integrated treatment of missingness in observations. The software,
currently in its version 2.0, is developed in C++ and can be used
either via command line or with the GUI under Linux and Windows
environments.

Availability: The SpaCEM3 software, a documentation and datasets
are available from http://spacem3.gforge.inria.fr/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Few of the module detection algorithms made available to
scientists for molecular biology data analysis (see Kim et al.,
2005 and references therein for a representative list) directly
model observations as measures carried out on individuals and
integrate interaction data. Generally, either the latter is omitted i.e.
individuals are considered as independent or individual observations
are transformed into a pairwise metrics, the choice of which is
intricate and can have a terrible impact on downstream analysis.

The SpaCEM3 software (Spatial Clustering with EM and Markov
Models) provides efﬁcient statistical tools to deal with high—
troughput biological data such as gene expression data. Its main
advantages are (i) the possibility to handle missing observations
and (ii) the possibility to integrate available interaction network
information. In a gene expression context, such interactions either
come from prior knowledge or from measures like two—hybrid
experiments. The integrated Markovian approach, which is at the
heart of the software, is presented in Section 2. An example of
application follows in Section 3.

2 APPROACH

For clarity purpose, we restrict our presentation to the case of
transcript levels and interaction data. The latter is retrieved from
databases and allows us to build a graph where nodes represent
genes and edges stem from direct interaction. Such interactions

range from conﬁrmed by expert to simply putative (Fig. la); ﬁxed
weights can hence be assigned to edges or need to be estimated. The
analysis is then recast into a biological object clustering framework.
A hidden Markov random ﬁeld (HMRF) is used to model individual
measures and graph interactions. The main originality of SpaCEM3
is that model estimation is based on a variational approximation
described in Celeux et al. (2003) for an expectation—maximization
(EM) algorithm in a mean—ﬁeld like setting. In this context, two new
features of the models available in the software are:

° a modelling (e.g. Gaussian) of class—dependent distributions
speciﬁcally built for high—dimensional data (Bouveyron et al.,
2007). It has been adapted to the Markovian setting and used
on biological data in Vignes and Forbes, 2009.

° an integrated treatment of data with missing observations in a
HMRF context (Blanchet and Vignes, 2009). This tackles the
missing value issue in microarrays in a probabilistic framework
and still enables a posteriori inference of incomplete
observations without imposing any pre—processing of the data.
We chose to present this feature in Section 3 for an illustrative
use of SpaCEM3 in the context of Molecular Biology.

Furthermore, the software provides extensions of the standard
HMRF model such as Triplet Markov models (Blanchet and Forbes,
2008) that allow objects to be assigned to subclasses (possibly
common to different clusters). It introduces an additional blanket
that could, for example, encode genetic dependencies. Applications
are at present limited to supervised classiﬁcation (so a training
set is needed). As it can be useful for comparison, other standard
algorithms are also available in SpaCEM3: k—means, iterated
conditional modes (ICM), standard EM and variants. The software
also includes classical imputation techniques for missing data: by
zeros, (un)conditional line/column mean/median, last observation
carried forward, KNN—imputation. In addition, model selection
can be performed using criteria such as the Bayes information
criterion (BIC; Schwarz, 1978) or integrated complete likelihood
(ICL; Biemacki et al., 2000) approximated in the Markovian case
(Forbes and Peyrard, 2003). Lastly, SpaCEM3 allows the user to
simulate the different models presented above.

(here from http://string.embl.de/) and individual measures carried
out on these components (yeast cell cycle DNA microarray images;
white spots represent missing observations in Fig. 1a). A HMRF
model integrates individual measures and graph interactions in
the SpaCEM3 software. It allows the user to specify the model,
estimate parameters and visualize the results in the GUI. In the
absence of gold standard to assess the accuracy of our results, we
investigated different biological features of the obtained modules:
network modularity, associated Gene Ontology (GO) terms, gene
expression proﬁles and connection to metabolic pathways (from
KEGG http://www.genome.jp/kegg/).

4 CONCLUSION

SpaCEM3 provides a stand—alone analysis tool to retrieve
meaningful modules of biological objects. It relies on powerful
recent developments on algorithms devoted to the inference of
probabilistic graphical models so that complex individual and
interaction biological data can be modelled together as shown in
Blanchet and Vignes (2009) and Vignes and Forbes (2009). The
GUI makes it easy for biologists to use. Further developments of
the software will follow theoretical work under progress to deal with
additional features of biological data: possibly spurious interactions
in databases and application to genetical genomics to reconstruct
biological networks.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Functional mapping that embeds the developmental
mechanisms of complex traits shows great power to study the
dynamic pattern of genetic effects triggered by individual quantitative
trait loci (QTLs). A full-sib family, produced by crossing two
heterozygous parents, is characteristic of uncertainties about cross-
type at a locus and linkage phase between different loci. Integrating
functional mapping into a full-sib family requires a model selection
procedure capable of addressing these uncertainties. 3FunMap,
written in VC++ 6.0, provides a flexible and extensible platform
to perform full-sib functional mapping of dynamic traits. Functions
in the package encompass linkage phase determination, marker
map construction and the pattern identification of QTL segregation,
dynamic tests of QTL effects, permutation tests and numerical
simulation. We demonstrate the features of 3FunMap through real
data analysis and computer simulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many traits important in agriculture, biology and medicine change
with time or other independent variables. The genetic control of
these dynamic complex traits should be accordingly expressed as a
function of the independent and continuous variable (Atchley, 1984).
A new breakthrough in mapping the dynamic change of quantitative
trait locus (QTL) effects has been recently made through the
invention of a series of statistical models, called functional mapping
(He at al., 2009; Li and Wu, 2010; Wu and Lin, 2006). Functional
mapping integrates mathematical aspects of trait development into a
QTL mapping framework, enabling geneticists to test the interplay
between gene action and development. Ma et al. (2004) packed
functional mapping into a web—based platform, FunMap, for a
mapping population derived from inbred lines.

FunMap cannot be applied directly to a full—sib family produced
by crossing heterozygous parents. Inevitably, such a single full—sib
family that may generate an almost unlimited number of progeny
has been commonly used for QTL mapping in outcrossing species,
like forest trees and wildlife species (Zhang et al., 2009). Since
several assumptions essential for linkage mapping, including a ﬁxed
marker cross—type, known linkage phase and known parental origin

of QTL alleles, do not exist in outcrossing populations, a model
selection procedure should be implemented to make an inference
about these uncertainties from observed marker and phenotypic data.
Here, we report a new package of Windows software, 3FunMap,
which conducts functional mapping of dynamic QTLs segregating
in a full—sib family derived from two heterozygous parents.

Since the genotypes of the two parents are unknown, the
segregation of a QTL in a full—sib family may obey the
following possible types: full cross (segregating 1:1:111), pseudo—
F2 cross (segregating 1:211) and pseudo—backcross (segregating
1:1). By incorporating model selection criteria, such as Akaike
Information criterion (AIC) and Bayesian information criterion
(BIC), 3FunMap can discern an optimal segregation type based on
a given dataset, thus meeting the urgent need for analysis tools
of functional mapping capable of handling the complexities of
genetic segregation associated with crossed heterozygous parents.
The software integrates a comprehensive suite of biological merits
of functional mapping in terms of testing and estimating the
developmental pattern of genetic effects triggered by dynamic QTLs.
The software enables users to test when a QTL is switched on to
perform its function, when the QTL is switched off to cease the
function, how long it is expressed in a time course and with which
temporal pattern is the QTL effect operational? Wu and Lin (2006)
classiﬁed four temporal patterns of genetic expression for a QTL, i.e.
long, early, late and inverse. By asking and addressing biologically
meaningful questions, 3FunMap will help to better understand the
genetic and developmental architecture of complex traits.

2 EXAMPLE

In Supplementary Material 1, we provided the implementation
of 3FunMap that performs functional mapping in a full—sib
family by taking into account the characteristics of outcrossing
populations. A full—sib family of 86 hybrids was derived from
the hybridization between Populus deltoides and Reuramericana.
A panel of codominant and dominant markers was genotyped to
construct an integrative linkage map of 19 groups (Zhang et al.,
2009). Ramets from the genotyped hybrids were water cultured in
a randomized complete block design in a green house. During 65
day culture in water, the total number of roots (TNR) per cutting
was repeatedly measured once every other week (Supplementary
Material 2).

By ﬁtting time—varying TNR values using Legendre polynomials
(Lin and Wu, 2006), 3FunMap scans the linkage map under
different types of QTL segregation; each generates an LR proﬁle
for QTL detection (Fig. 1). By comparing the critical thresholds
from permutation tests, 3FunMap detected three QTLs: TNRQl on

across all the 19 linkage groups in the integrated map of Rdeltoides and
Reuramericana assuming that a QTL is segregating in the type of full cross
(A), pseudo—F2 cross (B) and pseudo—backcross (C). Short horizontal line
segments represent 19 linkage groups. Threshold values for asserting the
existence of a QTL were determined from 1000 permutation tests, which are
18.42, 39.81 and 49.35 at P=0.05 (indicated by dot horizontal lines) for
three segregation types, respectively. The peaks of LR proﬁles beyond the
thresholds under a speciﬁc QTL cross—type indicate the genomic locations
of the QTLs detected.

linkage group 9 that was identiﬁed by the full cross and pseudo—F2
model; TNRQ2 on linkage group 3 identiﬁed by the full cross and
pseudo—backcross model; and TNRQ3 on linkage group 7 identiﬁed
by the pseudo—backcross model. Based on both the AIC and BIC,
it is more likely that TNRQl is a pseudo—F2 QTL, whereas TNRQ2
is a pseudo—backcross QTL. The estimates of QTL locations, QTL
segregation types and heritabilities at each time point are given in
Supplementary Material 3.

3FunMap drew developmental curves of TNR for different
genotypes at each QTL (Fig. 2). TNRQl exerts both additive and
dominant effects on TNR growth. The additive effect of this QTL
is quite stable, but its dominant effect changes dramatically with
time and even alters the direction in an early stage. This QTL is
operational in an additive to dominant manner, but after about 90
days in water culture, it is switched to perform its overdominant
effect. At a beginning of growth, TNRQ2 shows a decreasing effect
with time, but after a particular time its effect increases gradually.
The effect of TNRQ3 decreases slightly with time and shortly
increases exponentially with time. All the QTLs detected show
complex gene >< time interactions.

3 DISCUSSION

We described a Windows software, 3FunMap, to perform functional
mapping in a full—sib family by considering unique outcrossing
characteristics of heterozygous parents. With 3FunMap, users can

construct an integrative linkage map by using all types of molecular
markers (Lu et al., 2004), map—speciﬁc QTLs that govern dynamic
changes of a complex trait, select an optimal type of QTL segregation
and estimate the temporal pattern of genetic effects triggered by
individual QTLs. To our best knowledge, this is a ﬁrst package
of software that can handle dynamic QTL segregation in a full—sib
family in a comprehensive way. It equips breeders and geneticists
for outcrossing species with a powerful tool to dissect the genetics
of dynamic complex traits.

3FunMap has incorporated a function to run simulation studies
to investigate the statistical behavior of functional mapping for a
full—sib family. Results from computer simulation under different
heritability levels and sample sizes (Supplementary Material 4)
suggest that a modest heritability (H 2 20.1) would provide
a reasonably accurate estimate of the genetic control of trait
trajectories when a sample size n=400 is used. It is important
to emphasize that a better management of plants that minimizes
environmental and phenotyping errors may be more useful for the
enhancement of QTL mapping precision than augmenting the size
of roughly managed samples.

We also tested model misspeciﬁcation by simulating and
analyzing data reciprocally using different segregation models.
Under H 2 20.1 and n=400, 3FunMap has full power to identify
a correct model.

We recognize the importance of epistasis in trait control. Epistasis
has been incorporated into our software. For a single QTL model,
3FunMap uses ~20 min on a PC desktop to draw the LR proﬁles
for the Populus example shown in Figure 1. Yet, computing time on
for epistatic detection for a full—sib family increases exponentially
because there are many combinations of segregation types between
any two QTLs. Also, two full—cross QTLs produce 16 genotypes,

thus increasing the dimension of epistasis. Although analysis and
discrimination processes of epistasis in a full—sib family can be
accelerated by parallelizing a cluster of machines, we are currently
working to incorporate score statistics approaches (Change et al.,
2009) for functional mapping to enhance computing efﬁciency.

Supervised machine-learning approaches are frequently applied
on biological data to learn a regression or classiﬁcation model,
whether used for prediction, classiﬁcation or for gaining an
understanding on the biological process that has generated the
data (Larranaga et al., 2006). Arguably however, it is sometimes
the case that sophisticated and complicated methods are em-
ployed, published and advocated as advances without a compari-
son even against the simplest baseline methods. We consider a
baseline method as the simplest method that an expert analyst
can conceive within a few minutes of consideration of the prob-
lem and does not require any engineering or scientiﬁc ingenuity
or novelty. A baseline can take the form of comparing against
predicting by the mean of the outcome on a known dataset,
without use of any special predicting variables, or comparing
against random guessing. Because of this lack of comparison,
the added-value of the sophisticated methods—if any—is not
quantiﬁed; it remains unknown whether the extra effort for im-
plementing or applying it is worth. A false perception about the
difﬁculty of the problem may be created.

We now present an example of the above argument on the
problem of identifying the position of miRNA mature molecules
on their precursor RNA molecules, which typically have a hair-
pin-like secondary structure. In the cell, the miRNA precursor is
ﬁrst cut into a complex of two substring sequences (strands) with
high complementarity called the “5’-strand’ and the “3’-strand’.
The complex is called the miRNA:miRNA* duplex deﬁned by its
four corners denoted as k55, k53, k35 and k33 corresponding to the
5’-strand 5’-end, 5’-strand 3’-end, 3’-strand 5’-end and 3’-strand
3’-end positions, respectively (Fig. l). The two strands are then
separated and either one or both become a functional miRNA.
The task is to predict the positions k55, k53, k35 and k33 given the
sequence of a miRNA-hairpin molecule. Note that a hairpin
corresponds to the sequence of the “Stem-loop’ structure as pro-
vided by miRBase, which does not necessarily represent the exact
pre—miRNA sequence but consists of the latter extended with
some ﬂanking nucleotides. Solving the problem can suggest

novel miRNAs within suspected miRNA-hairpin sequences, to
guide miRNA discovery, as well as provide intuition regarding
the mechanisms regulating the miRNA biogenesis.

The ﬁrst tool that addressed this prediction task was ProMiR
(Nam et al., 2005) which did not use any baseline method.
Subsequent studies used the previous methods as baselines with-
out considering the simplest possible method. What is the base-
line “straw man’ on this problem? Arguably, it is making a
prediction based on the mean position of each corner k55, k53,
k35 and k33 as estimated from a training set of known miRNA
duplexes and their precursor sequences. We call this method the
Simple Geometric Locator (SGL) obviously providing a constant
predicted position on any hairpin independent of the input se-
quence. An important detail to address is to deﬁne the reference
point for measuring the mean position since miRNA precursors
have various lengths. We chose the terminal loop tip as the ref-
erence point as it does not depend on the length of the pre-
miRNA-ﬁanking regions included in the hairpin sequence (see
Supplementary Material, ﬁle 1 for details).

The set of ‘cannons’ to compare against SGL form four of the
state-of-the—art tools for the task, namely MatureBayes [we note
that MatureBayes did compare against the SGL in Gkirtzou
(2009). Unfortunately, the reference point used for the SGL
was the beginning of the ﬂanking regions, whose length is arbi-
trarily chosen before miRNA precursors are inserted in the
MiRBase; hence, the performance of the SGL was found inferior
in that work] (Gkirtzou et al., 2010), MiRPara Wu et al., 2011),
MaturePred (Xuan et al., 2011) and the most recent MiRdup
(Leclercq et al., 2013) published in respectable venues such as
PLOS ONE, BM C Bioinformatics and Nucleic Acids Research.
These tools employ machine-learning algorithms such as the
Na'ive Bayes Classiﬁer, Support Vector Machines and the
random forest classiﬁer. They also employ complex raw and
constructed features that include the nucleotide sequence, the
secondary structure, number of loops and bulges, matches or
mismatches for each nucleotide and others.

In our comparison, “prediction error’ on the task for each
corner (end) is measured as the End Absolute Error (EAE):
the absolute error of the predicted minus the true position (in
nucleotides) for a speciﬁc duplex end (see Supplementary
Material, ﬁle 1 for an example). To measure “prediction accur-
acy’, we deﬁne as “correct’ a prediction with error less or equal to
a number x, i.e. EAE g x. Then, the prediction accuracy for an
error bound (tolerance) of at most x, denoted as Accu(x), is the
percentage of correct predictions in the test set. For example, if a

estimated using the EAE for up to 5 nt. In each subplot, the y-axis shows
the prediction accuracy of the Simple Geometric Locator (in %) and the
x-axis shows the prediction accuracy of other methods (in %) for the

model identiﬁes the position of a given duplex end in 50% of
duplexes within at most :l:4 nt from their true position, it has
accuracy at 4nt of 50%: Accu(4) = 0.5. “Statistical signiﬁcance’
of the results is assessed by assuming the null hypothesis that two
methods have the same accuracy for a given error bound and
applying the Fisher’s exact test. To ensure fairness, in each com-
parison the SGL is trained (estimates the mean positions) with
each method’s training set, the one employed in the correspond-
ing publication, after removing all miRNA hairpins with un-
known duplexes. The performance accuracies of all tools are
estimated on a common hold-out test set, as detailed in
Supplementary Material, ﬁle 1. Since some tools do not provide
a prediction on all hairpins, the estimation of accuracy is com-
puted only on the hairpins for which a prediction is made; SGL
of course, always provides a prediction.

The results are shown in Figure 1. First, the accuracies Accu,(x)
are computed for each tool i and duplex end for an EAE of x = 0,
l, 2,. . ., 5nt. Subsequently, these accuracies are plotted against
each other by connecting the points (Accu,(0), AccuSGL(0)),
(Accu,(l), AccuSGL(l)), . . . , (Accu,(5), AccuSGL(5)). For example,
a point (Accui(1)= 30%, AccuSGL (1): 40%) implies that method
i identiﬁed 30% of the duplexes in the test set within :l:1 nt of their
true position, while SGL identiﬁed 40% of duplexes within :l:1 nt
of their true position. Thus, if a line is on the diagonal, then the
two methods achieve the same accuracy for the same error toler-
ance. If it is below the diagonal SGL achieves lower accuracy for
the same error tolerance and if it is above the diagonal, then the
SGL achieves higher accuracy for the same error tolerance than
the method compared against.

As evident from the ﬁgure, SGL clearly and statistically sig-
niﬁcantly outperforms MaturePred (red) in predicting any of the
four duplex corners for all error bounds and MatureBayes (ma-
genta) for error bounds up to 3—4 nt. On the 5’-strand SGL and
MiRdup (green) achieve similar accuracies for absolute error of
at most 0 and lnt with MiRdup slightly improving for larger
error bounds; MiRPara (cyan) on the 5’-strand is better by only
2—5%. In the 3’-strand, MiRdup and MiRPara exhibit an overall
better performance than SGL. However, when focusing on the
accuracy with zero tolerance Accu(0), i.e. the percentage of
duplexes identiﬁed on their exact position corresponding to the
ﬁrst point of each line, only MiRPara shows signiﬁcantly better
results with the difference in performance ranging from 4—11%
(see Fig. l and Supplementary Table S1).

CONCLUSION

Comparing against the simplest possible method as a baseline in
data analysis is an important step of the analysis. Foregoing this
step may result in unnecessary effort and energy spent in code
developing, publishing and evaluations by future researchers,
unnecessary use of computationally expensive methods and a
false impression about their beneﬁts and added value they pro-
vide in a given task. As an example we show that using the mean
positions in predicting the four corners of a miRNA duplex
complex outperforms some state-of—the-art methods and is on
par with the rest when trying to predict the exact location of
the duplex with zero tolerance.

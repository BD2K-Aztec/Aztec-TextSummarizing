ABSTRACT

Summary: To facilitate the exploration of publicly available Zea mays
expression data, we constructed a maize expression compendium,
making use of an integration methodology and a consistent probe to
gene mapping based on the 5b.60 sequence release of Z. mays. The
compendium is made available through a web portal MAGIC that
hosts a variety of analysis tools to easily browse and analyze the
data. Our compendium is different from previous initiatives in combin-
ing expression values across different experiments by providing a con-
sistent gene annotation across different platforms.

1 INTRODUCTION

Owing to its importance as sustainable food and feedstock, maize
genomics is of high academic and industrial relevance. As a result,
microarrays have been widely applied to interrogate the maize
transcriptome, with currently >100 maize gene expression experi-
ments being publicly available in online repositories such as GEO
(Barrett et al., 2011) and ArrayExpress (Parkinson et al., 2009).
However, cross-platform differences, the lack of consistent plat-
form and measurement descriptions and inconsistent gene anno-
tations in maize complicated the straightforward use of these data.

To integrate the data from different array platforms in a readily
usable single compendium, we resolved gene annotation inconsis-
tencies by reannotating probes of previously published Zea mays
arrays using the published maize genome sequence (Schnable
et al., 2009) and made measurements comparable across different
platforms/experiments using an adapted version of the data inte-
gration method described by Engelen et al. (2011). This resulted in
a cross-platform expression compendium containing 1749 micro-
arrays covering 24 690 genes. Additional gene information was

integrated from various external sources. Experimental annota-
tions were manually curated. A web access portal MAGIC with a
specialized set of exploration and analysis functionalities provides
public access to this compendium.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Compendium creation

The compendium itself corresponds to a matrix of which the rows cor-
respond to genes and columns to sample contrasts. A sample contrast is
deﬁned as the comparison of the gene’s expression between two different
biological samples, one acting as a test and the other as a reference. Each
value in the matrix then represents the expression change of a gene pre-
sented as the log-ratio of its expression in the test versus the reference
samples.

2.1.] Probe reannotation Probes were reannotated using the latest
release of the maize genome. Original probe sequences, if available, were
obtained from the respective platform annotation ﬁles or otherwise from
GenBank based on the corresponding GI numbers. They were used as
query against the curated ‘Filtered Gene Set’ (FGS) of the 5b.60 release
of B73 maize genome using MegaBLAST version 2.2.17 (Zhang et al.,
2000). Both the gene and the transcript models of FGS are searched to
increase the eventual hit rate. Different blast parameters were chosen for
oligo and cDNA probes, respectively, as they considerably differ in length
and speciﬁcity. For probes that mapped to multiple genes, we identiﬁed
the most speciﬁc hit by comparing the hit quality across different targets.
Only probes for which a sufﬁciently unique probe-to-gene mapping (de-
tails in Supplementary Methods) could be identiﬁed were retained for
compendium construction.

2.1.2 Expression data homogenization Microarray experiments
were retrieved from GEO and ArrayExpress. Each experiment can be
composed of multiple arrays. A distinction is made between one- and
two-channel arrays, which differ from each other in the number of sam-
ples tested per array. Irrespective of the used platform, raw expression
intensities were extracted for each channel (sample) separately. To make
measurements between one- and two-channel platforms comparable, all
expression measurements were converted to log ratios (as contrasts) that
compare the expression between a test and a reference sample, respect-
ively, both from the same experiment. For each contrast, proper test and
reference samples were assigned based on the corresponding experiment
annotation. Raw expression data were subsequently normalized using
dedicated procedures (Engelen et al., 2011) and mapped to the corres-
ponding genes based on the probe annotation (see Section 2.1.1).

2.2 Compendium annotation

To improve biological interpretation of the compendium, we integrated
gene (row) and contrast (column) annotation from publicly available re-
sources and curated all available information.

To facilitate gene selection, we included, next to gene ids from 5b.60
genome release, gene names from MaizeGDB (Lawrence et al., 2004) and
Xref assignments from www.maizesequence.org to provide mapping from
EntrezGene and UniProt ids. As for functional annotations, metabolic
pathway information (version 2.0) from Gramene Wouens-Clark et al.,
2010) and Gene Ontology annotations from www.maizesequence.org
were provided.

To compensate for the often cryptic and incomplete condition anno-
tations available in public expression repositories, we provided curated
annotations incorporating the information from both online repositories
and the corresponding publications. Note that in our compendium, ex-
pression values are represented as log-ratios of a contrast between two
samples. Experimental annotation is provided both at the level of the
individual sample and that of the contrast. Annotation at the sample
level includes tissue, development stage and genotype speciﬁcations
(breeding line). The ﬁrst two are described using Plant Ontology
(Avraham et al., 2008)-derived ontology terms, whereas genotype speci-
ﬁcations are based on the names of cultivars or wild-type. At the contrast
level, we associated perturbation annotations speciﬁed as a set of relevant
properties and corresponding values of change that reﬂect the stimuli that
trigger expression alterations in the test versus the reference.

2.3 Compendium exploration

To facilitate the exploration of the compendium, we constructed a web
access portal MAGIC providing a set of analysis functionalities. At ﬁrst,
MAGIC allows users to specify their own subcompendium of interest,
which only contains contrasts sharing the same characteristics. Users can
choose between various predeﬁned subcompendia. Subcompendia focus-
ing on environmental perturbations and on comparisons between lines,
between tissues and between development stages are available.
Alternatively, users can generate customized subcompendia based on
the sample and contrast annotations.

Once a (sub)compendium is selected, the system provides tools to ex-
plore and visualize the expression data in a module-centralized manner
where a module is deﬁned as a subset of the (sub)compendium containing
the expression values of a set of genes under a set of contrasts. A module
can be created starting from a query set of genes or contrasts to which
contrasts or genes are added, respectively, based on their properties (such
as the coexpression level, or the expression consistency). An existing
module can easily be altered, merged with other modules or split into
several modules. Each module can be visualized as an interactive heatmap
accompanied with corresponding annotation information.

Because most of the microarray platforms that MAGIC relies on were
developed before the genome release of maize, none of them cover the full
FGS gene set, and overlap in measured genes can be low for some plat-
form combinations (Supplementary Tables S2 and S3). We developed
functionalities that help users to control the number of missing values
in their analysis results (Website online help, section 6).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The compendium available through MAGIC currently contains
24 690 genes and 1310 sample contrasts. It covers 62% of the
genes in FGS of the 5b.60 release of B73 maize genome; the
remaining genes are not represented on any of the 27 platforms
included. The contrasts consist of 69 experiments obtained from
GEO and ArrayExpress, amounting to 1749 microarrays. Details
on the composition of the compendium in terms of the number

of genes and experiments covered per platform can be found in
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2. On average, a gene is mea-
sured in 9 of the 26 platforms and has been measured in 592 of
1310 contrasts (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2). The compen-
dium can be downloaded through its webportal MAGIC. An
elaborate online help, together with two tutorial case studies,
illustrates how the various functionalities of MAGIC can be
used to infer new biology. The case studies clearly illustrate
how information from different platforms contributes to the re-
sults obtained by MAGIC, and how to cope with missing values
that could become abundant if information from certain sets of
platforms is combined.

In contrast to MAGIC, comparable initiatives treat data from
different platforms or experiments separately. Genevestigator
(Hruz et al., 2008) and CORNET (De Bodt et al., 2012) con-
struct separate compendia for the Affymetrix Maize Genome
Array (GPL4032) (containing 558 and 340 arrays for
Genevestigator and CORNET) and the Nimblegen Maize
385 k Array (GPL12620) (containing 180 arrays in both systems).
PLEde (Dash et al., 2011), on the other hand, provides access
to the data from 44 Affymetrix and Nimblegen experiments. In
this system, data derived from each experiment are treated sep-
arately instead of being merged in a larger compendium. Of all
these systems, only CORNET provides a restricted meta-analysis
tool that allows combining information across the different com-
pendia. Compared with these related initiatives, our approach is
unique in directly combining data from different platforms in a
single compendium, obviating the need for an additional meta-
analysis step (Fierro et al., 2008) and enabling the construction
of a much larger compendium and the direct data analysis across
different platforms and experiments.

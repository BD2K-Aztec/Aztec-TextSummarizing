ABSTRACT

Summary: Recently developed methods that couple next-generation
sequencing with chromosome conformation capture-based tech-
niques, such as Hi-C and ChIA-PET, allow for characterization of
genome-wide chromatin 3D structure. Understanding the organization
of chromatin in three dimensions is a crucial next step in the unraveling
of global gene regulation, and methods for analyzing such data are
needed. We have developed HiBrowse, a user-friendly web-tool con-
sisting of a range of hypothesis-based and descriptive statistics, using
realistic assumptions in null-models.

Availability and implementation: HiBrowse is supported by all major
browsers, and is freely available at http://hyperbrowser.uio.no/3d.
Software is implemented in Python, and source code is available for
download by following instructions on the main site.

1 INTRODUCTION

Methods for detection of genome-wide chromatin 3D conform-
ation, such as Hi-C (Lieberman-Aiden et al., 2009) and ChIA-
PET (Fullwood et al., 2009), are drastically expanding our
understanding of genome biology. However, statistical and com-
putational methods to analyze chromatin conformation capture-
based data are needed. Many of the available methods focus on
data visualization, or are not suited for genome-wide statistical
investigations (Bau et al., 2010; Servant et al., 2012; Thongjuea
et al., 2013; Zhou et al., 2013). The structure of chromatin makes
statistical analysis complicated, due to correlations between the
interaction frequencies caused by both sequence-dependent and
topological constraints (Paulsen et al., 2013). A few statistical
tests have been proposed, with varying possibilities to account
for structural dependencies (Botta et al., 2010; Kruse et al., 2013;
Paulsen et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2013; Witten and Noble, 2012).
Two useful command-line tools are the hiclib-package (Imakaev

at al., 2012), and the HOMER software suit (Heinz et al., 2010),
which both allow for noise-removal, outlier detection and com-
partment identiﬁcation. The HOMER software additionally
allows for identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant interactions in a given
dataset, assuming a binomial distribution and a background
model taking into account sequence-based and compartmental
biases.

The global nature of these data allow for other types of stat-
istical investigations beyond detecting signiﬁcance of individual
interactions. A common type of analysis is to analyze a set of
genomic elements (genes, regulatory elements, transcription fac-
tors, etc.), and ask how this subset, or “query track’, is spatially
arranged in 3D space as represented by a Hi-C dataset, for ex-
ample. Here we present HiBrowse, a web-based analysis server
for performing statistical analysis of 3D genomes in a range of
different settings. The available statistics provide a ﬂexible and
expandable catalog of tools based on state-of-the-art statistical
methods utilizing Monte Carlo (MC) and analytic methods as
suited, in addition to a range of tools for visualization and hy-
pothesis-generating investigations.

2 FEATURES AND METHODS

2.1 Data representation and analysis framework

We build on general software components of the Genomic HyperBrowser
(Sandve et al., 2010, 2013), a web-based analysis server for genome-scale
data. The graphical user interface (GUI) is based on Galaxy (Goecks
et al., 2010), a user-friendly point-and-click environment familiar to
many researchers. All tracks are based on a representation of elements
as mathematical objects, consisting of points, segments, functions and
variants of these [see Gundersen et a]. (2011) for an in-depth discussion].
Any given analysis can be performed on all chromosomes, speciﬁc
chromosomes or selected sub-parts of chromosomes, depending on the
needs.

In practice, an analysis is initiated by selecting one or more tracks either
from the HyperBrowser repository, or from the user history. At least one
of the selected tracks must be a Hi-C (3D) track, and the accompanying
selected tracks (called “query tracks”) determine the types of statistical
analyses that are possible, and therefore selectable in the system.

A range of publicly available 3D-datasets have been installed in the
repository. Since it has been shown that Hi-C and similar data can con-
tain systematic biases, all the available Hi-C datasets have been corrected

for such biases using the method of Imakaev et a]. (2012). Furthermore, a
specialized tool has been developed to allow users to upload their own
Hi-C data (or similar) into the history, even if the dataset itself does not
conform to well-known formats. See Supplementary Table S1 for a list of
already installed and pre-processed Hi-C datasets.

2.2 Overview of statistical methods

Statistical tools are divided into two broad categories: hypothesis tests
and descriptive statistics. Hypothesis tests are both MC based and ana-
lytical. Due to the complex structure of chromatin conformation capture
data, ﬁnding suited explicit null distributions is generally not possible
(Paulsen et al., 2013; Witten and Noble, 2012), and even randomization
of the data through MC is difﬁcult. Therefore, we consistently perform
permutations on the query track only. The hypothesis tests can be divided
into three types, deﬁned by the query track type, as illustrated in
Figure 1A. For example, Points (P) are used to analyze general (all-
versus-all) 3D co-localization by specifying a set of genomic elements
using the BED format, while Linked Points (LP) are used to analyze
3D co-localization between selected pairs of elements by providing add-
itional information about which genomic elements that should be linked
together.

In the most basic case, if the user selects a set of points (genomic
elements) in BED-format in addition to a Hi-C data track, one may
ask whether all the genomic elements in the BED-ﬁle are more/less co-
localized in 3D, in an all-versus-all fashion, than what would be expected
by chance. In this case, the mean of the observed standardized interaction
frequencies is compared to the expected value estimated from the per-
muted positions in representative regions of the rest of the Hi-C (3D)
track. This analysis was introduced in Paulsen et a]. (2013), and in this
article we expand the methodologies by allowing a much wider variety of
query tracks. For example, by specifying two point-tracks (two BED
ﬁles), in addition to a Hi-C (or similar) track, the user can ask whether
the points in track 1 are more/less co-localized with track 2, than expected
by chance. In this type of statistical question, the permutations can be

 

performed on both of the point-tracks, or by preserving one of the point-
tracks completely.

It is also possible to specify particular interactions between a set of
genomic elements, and compare these interactions with randomly per-
muted interactions within the same set of elements. In HiBrowse, inter-
actions between genomic elements are deﬁned using LP, a format
described in detail elsewhere (Gundersen et al., 2011). Such linked track
types can easily be created by using a dedicated tool that converts from a
simple BED ﬁle format containing information about which elements
that should be linked together (see Supplementary Fig. S1, for an ex-
ample). Since this type of analysis only permutes interactions intrinsically
with regards to the query track, the positions of all elements will be
completely preserved. This type of analysis should be used whenever
speciﬁc interactions between genomic elements are considered, and it
would be natural to compare with random links between the same elem-
ents. Since regions of the genome can have varying properties (active/
inactive genes, open/closed chromatin, etc.), global shufﬂing of links be-
tween all selected elements is not always preferable. To take such proper-
ties into account during the permutation, each of the points can be
marked by a value, such that the link-permutations will be performed
by preserving the value-combinations on both sides of the links.

If the user wants full control over exactly what pairs of interactions
that are allowed to take part in the link-permutations, it is possible to
specify a case/control value on each of the links via a dedicated tool
which accepts two BED ﬁles (‘case’ and ‘control’) of the same format
as described above (see Supplementary Fig. S2, for an example). The
case/control—linked elements can then be selected together with a Hi-C
(3D) track, allowing the user to compare the interaction frequency of all
the links marked as ‘case’ with the expected interaction frequency given
by permuting the case/control labels. This type of statistic is optimal for
data that is only sampled from a pre—deﬁned set of elements of the
genome, and where the user wants to ﬁnd out whether a subset of
these elements are co-localized in 3D.

Finally, it is possible to ﬁnd statistically signiﬁcant differences be-
tween two Hi-C datasets, for example comparing treatments [as e.g. in

Rickman et al. (2012)]. The statistical test implemented for this type of
analysis is based on the edgeR-tool (Robinson et al., 2010). Details about
the mathematical formulation of the different types of statistics and their
corresponding null-hypotheses are found in the Supplementary Material.

In addition to hypothesis tests, a range of descriptive statistics have
been implemented. For example, each hypothesis test is accompanied by
an enrichment score, giving the degree of over/under-representation of
3D co-localization, compared to the expected 3D co-localization (see
Supplementary Material for details). Other types of available descriptive
statistics are visualization of clustered Hi-C matrices as heatmaps or
graphs, principal component analysis on Hi—C matrices and other sum-
mary statistics (see Supplementary Table S2 for a comprehensive list). All
available analyses are described thoroughly on the help pages linked from
the main site, where example histories are provided such that users can
explore each statistic in detail. Demo-buttons are provided for all tools,
giving small example runs. See Figure 1B and C for an analysis example.

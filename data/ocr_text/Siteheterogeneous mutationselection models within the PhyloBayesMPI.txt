ABSTRACT

Motivation: In recent years, there has been an increasing interest in
the potential of codon substitution models for a variety of applications.
However, the computational demands of these models have some-
times lead to the adoption of oversimplified assumptions, questionable
statistical methods or a limited focus on small data sets.

Results: Here, we offer a scalable, message-passing-interface-based
Bayesian implementation of site-heterogeneous codon models in the
mutation-selection framework. Our software jointly infers the global
mutational parameters at the nucleotide level, the branch lengths of
the tree and a Dirichlet process governing across-site variation at the
amino acid level. We focus on an example estimation of the distribu-
tion of selection coefficients from an alignment of several hundred
sequences of the influenza PB2 gene, and highlight the site-specific
characterization enabled by such a modeling approach. Finally, we
discuss future potential applications of the software for conducting
evolutionary inferences.

Availability and implementation: The models are implemented
within the PhyloBayes—MPI package, (available at phylobayes.org)
along with usage details in the accompanying manual.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is growing interest for the use of codon substitution
models in several contexts, including phylogenetic inference
(Gil et al., 2013), ancestral sequence reconstruction (Chang
et al., 2012) and the characterization of the selective effects of
speciﬁc nonsynonymous mutations (Tamuri et al., 2012).
Focusing on the latter, Halpern and Bruno (1998) first showed
how to devise a model that accounts for both global mutational
features at the nucleotide level and site-speciﬁc selective con-
straints at the amino acid level. Although their approach was
directed to the estimation of evolutionary distances, it was later
recognized as enabling the estimation of distributions of selection
coefﬁcients from phylogenetic data (see Thorne et al., 2012, for a
review of these developments). However, a serious issue with
the Halpern and Bruno model, and some of the subsequent
re-implementations (e.g.Tamuri et al., 2012), lies in the use of
site-speciﬁc parameters optimized to maximum likelihood esti-
mates; such an approach induces the ‘inﬁnitely many parameters

trap’, in which each additional observation changes the form of
the overall model (see Rodrigue, 2013).

Yang and Nielsen (2008) devised some simpler homogeneous
mutation-selection models, along with a likelihood ratio test
aimed at evaluating the signiﬁcance of codon usage bias. While
statistically well-justiﬁed, the homogeneity of their mutation-
selection models makes them biologically unsatisfying for the
purpose of estimating distributions of selection coefﬁcients.

Subsequently, we proposed the use of a nonparametric ap-
proach based on the Dirichlet process, providing a ﬂexible and
statistically well-founded method to accommodating across-site
heterogeneity of amino acid constraints (Rodrigue et al., 2010).
However, our proof-of-concept implementation only allowed for
its application on very small data sets, and its rate-limiting
Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) updates on the Dirichlet
process, based on a Chinese-restaurant approach, were not
amendable to parallelization.

Working with nucleotide and amino acid level substitution
models, we recently developed PhyloBayes—MPI, which, among
other speedup strategies, uses message-passing—interface (MP1)
and a truncated stick-breaking representation of the Dirichlet
process for parallelized updating (Lartillot et al., 2013). Here,
we have expanded PhyloBayes-MPI for the implementation of
several types of codon substitution models, including the
Dirichlet process-based site-heterogeneous mutation-selection
approach. We illustrate how the software can now be used for
efﬁcient estimation of distributions of selection coefﬁcients
(scaled by the effective chromosomal population size), and dis-
cuss several future avenues that it enables.

2 METHODS

In the present application, the program is passed an alignment ﬁle of
coding nucleotide sequences (of a length that is a factor of 3) and a
corresponding tree topology ﬁle. The universal genetic code is assumed,
but an alternative code can be speciﬁed (6. g. —mtvert for the vertebrate
mitochondrial code). As with other models with PhyloBayes—MPI, the
program uses K >1 cores. At startup, the master core draws an initial
model conﬁguration from the prior, and broadcasts it using MP1 to the
K — 1 compute cores. All updates are data-augmentation—based, which
are several orders of magnitude faster than pruning-based updates
(de Koning et al., 2010). Each iteration of the MCMC includes numerous
updates on global parameters, performed by the master core, whereas
compute cores perform several updates of a truncated stick-breaking
representation of the Dirichlet process (see Lartillot et al., 2013, for
details), and sample the data augrnentations.

tation-selection balance, with red histograms for mutations (mainly dele-
terious, hence negative values), and green histograms for substitutions
(symmetrical about 0, given the mutation-selection balance). Panel (c)
summarizes the ﬁrst 100 site-speciﬁc distributions of nonsynonymous
mutations

3 EXAMPLE

We present an example that we could not run with our previous
implementation, consisting of 401 sequences of the PB2 gene of
inﬂuenza, taken from Tamuri et al. (2012). With the present
implementation, we obtained a sample of 1100 draws within
~5 h, running on a 12 core (hyper-threaded), Intel i7-based
workstation. Discarding the ﬁrst 100 draws, we display the pos-
terior mean distributions of selection coefﬁcients (S) in Figure 1.

Looking at panel a, we ﬁnd that the highest-valued bin is that
of synonymous events (S: 0), most mutations (red) are deleteri-
ous (S < 0) and most substitutions (green) are either neutral (syn-
onymous) or nearly neutral. Whereas the ‘inﬁnitely many
parameters’ approach used by Tamuri et al. (2012) led to the
conclusion that most nonsynonymous mutations have
S < — 10, panel b shows that most have a selection coefﬁcient
between —10 and —2, with the mode situated at —5. The red
distribution, however, seems more plausible than that obtained
using a parametric site-speciﬁc approach (Rodrigue, 2013),
which inferred most nonsynonymous events with S between 0
and —5.

Panel c displays a site-speciﬁc assessment of the distributions
of S for nonsynonymous mutations, focusing on the ﬁrst 100
codons of the alignment. For graphical simplicity, we have
added up the values over a few sets of classes. The
—10<S 5 —2 class, in blue, is the most represented—as previ-
ously revealed from panel b—but some sites, e. g. codon 75, have
almost as many nonsynonymous mutations in the nearly neutral
class, —2<S 5 2, indicating that they are under less stringent
evolutionary constraints than other sites.

4 FUTURE DIRECTIONS

Our implementation enables numerous potential applications.
For instance, the last panel of Figure 1 suggests studies on the
distributions of S over classes of sites. Distributions could even be
generated for all possible types of nonsynonymous mutations at
each site. The software could also serve in the development of
approaches that explicitly incorporate structural features (e.g.
Meyer and Wilke, 2013), and already includes mutation-selection
models using ﬁnite mixtures, homogeneous versions and models
based on a univariate factor on nonsynonymous rates (co).
Applications of these models will be the focus of future papers.
Developed within the PhyloBayes-MPI package, the models
we have implemented here inherit the ability to perform a variety
of types of posterior predictive model assessments, cross-valid-
ation comparisons, ancestral sequence reconstruction, as well as
phylogenetic inference per se. Much more work is needed in these
contexts, to assess what insights may be gained from the muta-
tion-selection framework, and from codon substitution models in
general. The present application should help engage such work.

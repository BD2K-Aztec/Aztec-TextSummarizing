ABSTRACT

Summary: A significant proportion of eukaryote genomes consist of
transposable element (l'E)—derived sequence. These elements are
known to have the capacity to modulate gene function and genome
evolution. We have developed RetroSeq for detecting non-reference
TE insertions from Illumina paired-end whole-genome sequencing
data. We evaluate RetroSeq on a human trio from the 1000
Genomes Project, showing that it produces highly accurate TE calls.
Availabilty: RetroSeq is open-source and available from https://
github.com/tk2/RetroSeq.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transposable elements were ﬁrst discovered in maize by Barbara
McClintock in the early 20th century and have since been found
in almost every organism (McClintock, 1950). They are often
referred to as genomic parasites and most are relics of ancient
viral infections. In large eukaryote genomes such as human and
mouse, TEs make up almost half of the genome (Gogvadze and
Buzdin, 2009). There are two distinct classes of TEs: class I retro-
elements that move by a ‘copy and paste’ fashion and the less
prevalent class II DNA transposons that operate by a ‘cut and
paste’ mechanism. Within the retroelements, there are two
distinct classes, the long terminal repeat (LTR)-bound elements
and the non-LTR elements. In the human genome, there are two
main types of non-LTR elements, namely the short interspersed
nuclear elements (SINE) and long interspersed nuclear elements
(LINE). Within these classes, the Alu and L1 subfamilies are
known to remain functionally active and polymorphic. In labora-
tory mice, the LTR—bound elements (also known as endogenous
retroviral elements—ERVs) can be divided into several subfami-
lies and are known to be responsible for up to 10% of spontan-
eous mutations (Maksakova et al., 2006).

With the advent of next-generation sequencing technologies, it
has become feasible to catalogue all types of molecular variation
including insertions of large sequences such as TEs. Previously,
Hormozdiari et al. (2010) developed VariationHunter, Quinlan
et al. (2011) developed Hydra and Lee et al. (2012) developed
Tea for ﬁnding non-reference TE insertions. Several other

authors have used unpublished pipelines for ﬁnding
non-reference TEs in human samples (Stewart et al., 2011;
Ewing and Kazazian, 2011). Furthermore, a number of authors
have developed TE insertion site junction sequencing assays
and computational methods to detect non-reference TEs
(Akagi et al., 2008; Iskow et al., 2010).

In this article, we present our software, RetroSeq, which can
be used to discover non-reference TE insertions from whole
genome sequencing data with high accuracy. Previously, we
used RetroSeq to create a comprehensive catalogue of just over
one hundred thousand polymorphic SINE, LINE and ERV
elements across 17 mouse strains (Nellaker et al., 2012). Using
data from a trio of northern and western European ancestry
(CEU) from the 1000 Genomes Project, we show how
RetroSeq can be used to create an accurate set of TE calls.

2 METHODS, RESULTS, DISCUSSION

The input to RetroSeq is a binary alignment ﬁle (BAM) ﬁle, a
reference genome and a library of mobile element sequences or
a BED ﬁle of the locations of known TE elements in the reference
genome. The BAM ﬁle should contain both the mapped pairs and
the pairs with one end unmapped. RetroSeq is implemented in
Perl and uses SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) to access the BAM ﬁles.
RetroSeq has been tested with alignments derived from both
MAQ (Li et al., 2008) and BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009).
RetroSeq operates in two phases, the ﬁrst being the discovery
phase where discordant mate pairs are detected and assigned to
a TE class (Alu, SINE, LINE, etc.) using either the annotated TE
elements in the reference and/or aligned with Exonerate (Slater
and Birney, 2005) to the supplied library of transposable element
sequences. The calling phase uses the anchoring mates of the TE
candidate reads from the previous step and clusters these based on
their genomic location, and the strand to which they are aligned to
(Supplementary Fig. S1). F orward- and reverse-strand clusters are
created from the anchor reads and the clusters are then merged
into regions around putative break points. RetroSeq proﬁles the
density of the matched forward and reverse clusters and uses any
available soft-clipped reads to reﬁne the break points of the TE
insertion (see Supplementary Methods).

To evaluate the performance of RetroSeq, we obtained high
depth (>75x) Illumina HiSeq data produced at the Broad
Institute (ftp: / /ftp. 1 000 genomes.ebi.ac.uk/voll /ftp/technical /
working/20120117_ceu_trio_b37_decoy/) for a CEU trio (father
NA12891, mother NA12892 and the female offspring NA12878)
from the 1000 Genomes Project and used Retroseq, Tangram
(Marth group, unpublished data) and Tea (Lee et al., 2012) to

ﬁnd Alu and L1 insertions in each individual (Table 1). This trio
was previously part of a survey of Alu and L1 elements in a 1000
Genomes pilot project follow-up study (Stewart et al., 2011); how-
ever, the sequencing data available at the time provided lower
Illumina sequencing coverage for each genome (9—16x), which
hindered the sensitivity of Alu and L1 detection (Chip Stewart,
personal communication). For Alu elements, the sensitivity of
RetroSeq and Tangram is >97% for all three individuals, with
Tea slightly lower (see Table 1). For L1 elements, the sensitivity of
all the methods is uniformly lower, with RetroSeq and Tangram
performing best. However, when we look at the RetroSeq false
negative rates by TE type in the trio, we do not see a signiﬁcant
difference in the rates for L1 (6.3%) over Alu (6.8%) calls.

We can estimate an upper false discovery rate in the child by
examining the calls relative to the expected inheritance patterns.
If we consider the calls private to the child as false positives, the
false discovery rate of the callers varies signiﬁcantly
(Supplementary Table S1), with RetroSeq having the lowest
overall rate (7.7%), followed by Tangram (12.1%) and Tea
(14.3%). If we take the calls shared by the parents and not
found in the offspring, we can estimate the upper false negative
rate for RetroSeq in the offspring at 6.7%. We can use the
PCR-validated calls with precise break points to examine
the accuracy of the break points estimated by RetroSeq.
Supplementary Figs S2—S4 show the distribution of the break
points found by RetroSeq around the PCR-validated break
points. In NA12878, the vast majority (92%) of the break
points are within :l:50 bp of the PCR break points, with 40%
being within 10 bp (Supplementary Fig. S4).

The coverage for these samples is extremely high (>75x), so it
is useful to ask what is the effect on the sensitivity of TE calling
when the sequencing depth is lower. Therefore, we sub-sampled
the data from sample NA12878 at various depths and plotted the
sensitivity relative to (i) the PCR-validated calls and (ii) the inter-
section of the computational calls from Stewart et al., 2011 and
RetroSeq. Supplementary Fig. S5 shows that there is a signiﬁcant
drop off in sensitivity at depths lower than 20x, with the sensi-
tivity of the computational calls >90% at 40x coverage. Thus, in
the context of TE calling in low coverage populations, data from
multiple individuals could be pooled to increase the sensitivity of
TE discovery.

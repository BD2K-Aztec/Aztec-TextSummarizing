Abstract

Motivation: Inference of gene regulatory networks from high throughput measurement of gene
and protein expression is particularly attractive because it allows the simultaneous discovery of
interactive molecular signals for numerous genes and proteins at a relatively low cost.

Results: We developed two score—based local causal learning algorithms that utilized the Markov
blanket search to identify direct regulators of target mRNAs and proteins. These two algorithms
were specifically designed for integrated high throughput RNA and protein data. Simulation study
showed that these algorithms outperformed other state—of—the—art gene regulatory network learn—
ing algorithms. We also generated integrated miRNA, mRNA, and protein expression data based
on high throughput analysis of primary trophoblasts, derived from term human placenta and
cultured under standard or hypoxic conditions. We applied the new algorithms to these data and
identified gene regulatory networks for a set of trophoblastic proteins found to be differentially
expressed under the specified culture conditions.

1 Introduction

 

Complex and adaptive biological systems exhibit homeostatic resili—
ence. They are also capable of adopting a new steady state in re—
sponse to endogenous or exogenous cues, and must therefore harbor
robust transcriptional and translational regulatory networks.
Network signals are transmitted within the cell, tissue or organismal
environment. MicroRNA regulatory networks represent an import—
ant component of the adaptive cellular response (De Lella Ezcurra
et 61]., 2012; Tay et 61]., 2014). There are extensive descriptions of
the derivation of miRNA regulatory networks using experimental or
computational methods. Experimental approaches are based on

profiling and manipulation of signals, such as miRNAs knockdown/
overexpression and assessment of mRNA expression changes, or on
enrichment approaches, where miRNAs and mRNAs are pulled
down with the Argonaute 2 protein, as in HITS—CLIP (Chi et 61].,
2009) or PAR-CLIP experiments (Hafner et 61]., 2010). These
approaches are used for searching miRNA—mRNA binding sites and
the interactions among the selected transcripts. Computational
methods, such as TargetScan (Lewis et 61]., 2005), miRDB (Wang
and El Naqa, 2008) and PicTar (Krek et 61]., 2005), are largely based
on in silico strategies, where the miRNA’s mRNA targets are
predicted by thermodynamic analysis of miRNA sequence and

evolutionary conserved potential binding sites (e.g. in the 3’ UTR)
with the mRNA transcripts. Each of these approaches has advan—
tages and disadvantages. For example, the experimental approaches
can definitively address the regulatory relations between miRNAs
and target mRNAs, and hence tend to serve as a gold standard, yet
they are also expensive and tedious. In addition, enrichment for
miRNA and mRNA by pull-down approaches may not imply a func—
tional interaction. In silico approaches are fast and relatively cheap,
but may provide an extensive list of possible miRNA-mRNA inter-
actions, and fall short of inferring dynamic relations between
miRNAs and mRNAs in any specific cell type or tissue.

Unlike the experimental and the in silico approaches, the statis—
tical approaches derive regulatory relations among miRNAs and
mRNAs through analysis of miRNA and mRNA expression data. In
particular, linear regression—based methods have been employed in
the search of miRNAs that directly regulate targeted mRNAs in a
specific system (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2013; Lu et 61]., 2011; Stanhope
et 61]., 2009). In these methods, the log expression of an mRNA is
assumed to be expressed as a linear combination of the log expres-
sion of miRNAs targeting that mRNA, and/or the product of the log
expression of the targeting miRNAs and Argonaute transcripts.
Various model selection methods, including stepwise model selec—
tion using information criterion score, L1 norm regularization based
Lasso algorithm (Tibshirani, 1996), can be used to identify miRNAs
that are significant predictors of target mRNAs. These selected
miRNAs are assumed to be regulators of the target mRNA. The
main advantages of these regression—based methods are that (i), they
can utilize observational expression data that were generated for
other purposes in order to derive the miRNA regulatory network for
a particular system, and (ii), they can be used, with little or no modi—
fication, to identify the targets of any non—coding RNAs (ncRNAs).
However, a major weakness inherent to the implementation of these
methods to miRNA regulatory networks is their inability to distin-
guish between (partial) correlation and causation. Therefore, even
when the assumptions of these algorithms were satisfied, miRNAs
discovered using these algorithms will not only contain species that
regulate target mRNAs, but also miRNAs concomitantly regulated
with the target mRNA or with the protein product of the target
mRNA. See a hypothetical miRNNmRNA/protein regulatory net—
work in Supplementary Fig. 81.

In the past two and half decades, there have been rapid develop—
ments in research on learning causal relations from observational
data (Pearl, 2000; Spirtes et 61]., 2000). A variety of causal learning
algorithms have been proposed, including score—based algorithms,
constraint—based algorithms, local learning algorithms, algorithms
allowing latent variables, cyclic causal relations, time—series data
and non—Gaussian numeric data (Aliferis et 61]., 2003; Chickering,
2002; Chu and Glymour, 2008; Richardson, 1996; Shimizu et 61].,
2011; Spirtes et 61]., 1999). These causal learning algorithms seem
particularly suitable for inferring gene regulatory networks from
high throughput gene expression data. However, applying causal
learning algorithms to the construction of gene regulatory networks
raises two major obstacles: (i) the regulatory networks are extremely
complex, involving thousands of mRNAs, ncRNAs, proteins, and
other molecular species, and (ii), the sample size of the ncRNA,
mRNA and protein expression data may be small, often magnitudes
less than the number of analyzed variables.

In this article, we propose two new causal learning algorithms
for inference of local ncRNA-mRNA—protein regulatory networks.
Given a target mRNNprotein, these algorithms identify the molecu—
lar species that directly regulate the target, and the molecular species
that are directly regulated by the target. These algorithms use a

score—based, local learning strategy to address the challenges of a
large number of ncRNA-mRNA—protein sets in the network. The
first algorithm, called the Markov Blanket Search for mRNA
Regulatory Networks (MBSmRN), requires knowledge of the
molecular species that are directly regulated by the target molecule,
and is specifically designed for identifying direct regulators of
mRNAs. The second algorithm, called the Markov Blanket Search
for Non—Gaussian Integrated Genomic data (MBSNIG), requires the
expression data for the target molecular species to be ‘count data’
(e.g. sequencing count data for miRNNmRNA expression, and
mass spectral count data for protein expression), and can be applied
to ncRNA—mRNA—protein expression data generated from most
experimental designs.

We evaluated the performance of these two algorithms using
simulated data, and compared them with two representative
algorithms, the general purpose Max-Min Hill-Climbing (MMHC)
algorithm for local causal discovery (Tsamardinos et 61]., 2006), and
the Lasso regression based algorithm for miRNA regulatory
networks (Lu et 61]., 2011; Stanhope et 61]., 2009). The MMHC algo—
rithm starts with a constraint based local learning algorithm,
Max—Min Parents and Children (Tsamardinos et 61]., 2003), to
derive for each variable, a list of candidate parents and children
(CPC) of that variable. This algorithm then orients and, possibly,
trims the edges connecting the target variable and its CPC using a
score based hill—climbing algorithm. The Lasso regression—based
algorithm selects a set of miRNAs and proteins that best predict the
expression of the target mRNA/protein using the Lasso—based
feature selection method. The selected miRNAs/proteins are con—
sidered the direct regulators of the target mRNNprotein. We also
applied our new algorithms to an integrated miRNA-mRNA-protein
expression data set from experiments using primary human placen-
tal trophoblasts that were exposed for 72h to standard culture
conditions or to hypoxia (02 < 1%), which mimics physiologically
relevant placental injury (Oh et 61]., 2011; Roh et 61]., 2005). We
selected 78 target mRNA/protein pairs and, for each of them, identi-
fied the miRNAs and proteins that directly regulated the target
mRNA and protein.

2.1 Score—based learning of local gene regulatory
network

We developed two algorithms for learning local ncRNNmRNNpro
tein regulatory networks. These algorithms are termed the
MBSmRN and MBSNIG. Akin to current regression model—based
methods for miRNA targets and other causal learning algorithms
for genetic regulatory networks (Le and Bar—Joseph, 2013; Le et 61].,
2013; Lu et 61]., 2011; Stanhope et 61]., 2009), these two new algo—
rithms assume that (i), the relation between a target mRNA or pro—
tein and its regulators is approximately linear, and (ii), if one
molecule X is a direct regulator of another molecule Y, then Y
cannot be a direct or indirect regulator of X. The MBSmRN algo-
rithm is based on linear (mixed effect) models for the log expression
of each target molecular species, while the MBSNIG algorithm is
based on generalized linear (mixed effect) models for the count of
each target. The independent variables in these models include the

log expression of the ncRNAs and proteins, as well as external fac—
tors related to the experiment. In the model for protein targets, the
independent variables also included the log expression of the mRNA
transcript that encoded the target protein. When the data are
grouped, the grouping factor could serve as a random effect of the
model. Argonaute—2 could also be included in the model.

For illustration, consider the miRNA, mRNA and protein data
for trophoblasts cultured in standard or hypoxic conditions
described earlier. Because the measurements of miRNAs and
mRNAs were continuous microarray data, while the measurements
of proteins were mass spectrometry count data, we used linear
mixed effect models for target mRNAs:

Gi,k,t = gr + Zibi,iMj,/e,t + Zici,i10g(Pi,k,t) + Zbdi,l’15l),t + Si,k + 8i,k,t
(1)

and generalized linear mixed effect models for target proteins:

10g(ElPi,k,tl) 2 Pi + diGz,k,t + Zjbi,iM/',k,t + Zici,i10g(Pi,k,t)
+ Zbdiflélm‘ + 51,}: + 8i,k,t (2)

In the above equations, PM), and GUN represent the count of the
ith protein and the log expression of its mRNA transcript in a sam—
ple obtained from the kth placenta and exposed to the tth condition,
Mi,
sample, (3],), is the Kronecker delta function where 5W: 1 if lo : t,

k), represents the log expression of the jth miRNA in the same

and (3),), = 0 otherwise, SM represents the lath placenta on the ith pro—
tein. The parameters g,- and [9,- represent the (hypothetical) overall
expression of the ith mRNA and ith protein in the placenta, respect—
ively, 61,-, bi,- and c,-,- represent the effect of Gikt, MW and ijt on the
target, and d”, represents the effect of the lath condition on the
target. Finally, 8U“ represents an independent random error. Note
that Argonaute—2 protein and its interaction with miRNAs were not
incorporated in the above models because this protein had an
extremely low expression level, and was nearly constant across all
trophoblast samples in our experiment data. For simplicity, among
all types of ncRNAs we only included miRNAs as candidate regula—
tors in our model.

Once the statistical models for the experimental data were speci—
fied [e.g. as in equations (1) and (2)], the MBSmRN and MBSNIG
algorithms identified the ncRNAs and proteins that directly regu—
lated a target mRNA or protein through the inferences on the
Markov blankets of the target RNA or protein. Roughly speaking,
given a set of random variables V, and a variable X in V, the
Markov blanket of X in V is the minimum set of variables in V such
that conditional on which X is independent of all other variables in
V. (For the definition of Markov blanket and a brief introduction to
the graphic models based causal learning, see Spirtes et al., 2000).
Assume the experimental data could be represented by linear (mixed
effect) models similar to Equation (1). Let V be the set of all
ncRNAs and proteins, Ch(T,-) (‘children’) be the set of all molecular
species that were regulated directly by the target T,-, the MBSmRN
algorithm identified ncRNAs and proteins that directly regulated
target Ti:

MBSmRN algorithm:

1. Identify MB(T,-; V), the Markov blanket for the target T,- from
the set V of all ncRNAs and proteins, using the information
about Ch(T,-) and the splitting algorithm for Markov Blanket
with known direct effects (SAMB—KDE).

2. Identify Pa(T,-) 2 MB (T,,- MB (T,,- V) \ Clo(T,-)), the Markov blan—
ket for target T,- from variables in MB (Ti) \ CWT,- , using model
selection method. These are the candidate ncRNAs and proteins
that directly regulate target Ti.

MBSmRN requires knowledge about the molecular species dir—
ectly regulated by the target. In practice, this information is usually
only available for mRNAs. Therefore MBSmRN is primarily de-
signed for the identification of direct regulators of mRNAs. The in-
put data for MBSmRN could be either continuous expression data,
such as those produced by microarray, or count data, such as those
produced by sequencing or Mass Spectrometry.

The MBSNIG algorithm requires that the expression of the
target RNA or protein to be measured as count data. It utilizes the
non—Gaussian property of the count data to orient the direction of
regulation between the target and the ncRNAs and proteins in its
Markov blanket. The MBSNIG algorithm identifies the ncRNAs
and proteins that directly regulate the target RNA or protein, and
the RNAs and proteins that are regulated by that target. Assuming
the experimental data can be represented by generalized linear
(mixed effect) models similar to Equation (2), the MBSNIG algo—
rithm has the following two steps:

MBSNIG algorithm:

1. Identify MB (T,; V), the Markov blanket for target T,- from the
set V of all ncRNAs and proteins, and in case target T,- is a pro—
tein, the mRNA transcript for T,, using the general SAMB
(SAMB-G).

2. Identify the set of ncRNAs and proteins that directly regulate
target Ti, and the set of RNAs and proteins regulated by
target T,-, by applying the Partial Orientation of the Markov
Blanket for a non—Gaussian variable (POMB—NG) algorithm to
MB(T,-; V).

Note that in step 2, the RNAs and proteins that are regulated by
target Ti, identified by the POMB—NG algorithm, consist of all
RNAs and proteins regulated directly by T,-, as well as those RNAs
and proteins in MB(T,-; V), the Markov blanket of Ti, that are regu—
lated indirectly by T,-.

We developed two divide and conquer algorithms to identify the
Markov blankets for a target mRNA or protein from a causal suffi—
cient dataset as subroutines employed by the MBSmRN and
MBSNIG algorithms. The first algorithm, called ‘the SAMB with
known direct effects’ (SAMB—KDE), requires the prior knowledge of
the variables that are directly regulated by the target. Utilizing this
prior knowledge, the algorithm divides the search space of the
Markov Blanket into manageable parts, while ensuring that
the union of lists of variables derived from all parts is a superset of
the Markov blanket of the target. This union then is searched using
a model selection procedure to identify the Markov blanket of the
target. This algorithm is used in step 1 of the MBSmRN algorithm,
with the assumption that the only direct effect of a target mRNA is
its encoded protein.

The second algorithm, called the ‘general SAMB’, is a general
purpose Markov blanket search algorithm. This algorithm first uses
the divide and conquer approach to derive a list of variables contain—
ing all direct causes of the target variable, then augments this list
with variables that include all spouses of the target variable, and
finally performs a model selection procedure on this augmented list,
to derive the Markov blanket for the target variable. It is used in
step 1 of the MBSNIG algorithm.

Note that both the SAMB—KDE and the SAMB—G subroutines
do not specify the model selection method to be used. Users can
choose from diverse model selection methods, such as a stepwise
method based on information score, or Lasso. Therefore, their
time complexity may vary based on the choice of model selection
method.

We also developed an algorithm for the POMB—NG, used in step
2 of the MBSNIG algorithm. Given the Markov blanket MB(T,-; V)
for a non—Gaussian target variable Ti, this algorithm utilizes the
non—Gaussian property of target T,- to determine, for all variables in
the Markov blanket MB(T,-; V) of Ti, whether they are direct causes
of T,-, or direct and indirect effects of T,-, or neither. The detail of the
above three algorithms, their time complexity, and the proof of their
correctness can be found in the Supplementary material (Auxiliary
algorithms and Supplementary Fig. S2).

We used the resampling method to improve the stability of the
results from the MBSmRN and MBSNIG algorithms (Friedman
et al., 1999). Based on data structure, either resampling with re-
placement (bootstrap) or resampling without replacement could be
used. The MBSmRN and MBSNIG algorithms were applied to each
resampled dataset. Only the ncRNAs and proteins identified by the
MBSmRN and MBSNIG algorithms in multiple resampled datasets
were considered candidate RNAs and proteins directly regulating or
being regulated by the target.

The two algorithms could be modified to incorporate other a pri-
ori information. For example, a user’s assumption that among all
proteins only transcription factors may be considered direct regula—
tors of target mRNAs can be accommodated by restricting the
search of the MBSmRN algorithm to the set of all ncRNAs and all
transcription factors. Similarly, if a user believes that miRNAs regu—
late only those mRNAs with perfect matches to the seed of the
miRNAs, the user could also limit the search of the MBSmRN algo—
rithm to the set of all proteins and all those miRNAs with seeds per—
fectly matching to the target mRNA.

3. Results

3.1 Simulation study
We evaluated the performance of the MBSmRN and MBSNIG algo—
rithms using simulated data, and compared it to that of two repre—
sentative algorithms, the general purpose MMHC algorithm for
local causal discovery (Tsamardinos et al., 2006), and the Lasso re—
gression—based algorithm for miRNA regulatory network (Lu et al.,
2011; Stanhope et al., 2009). (Note that Stanhope et al. used the
Akaike information criterion (AIC) score—based feature selection
method, and used mRNA expression as a surrogate for protein ex—
pression). Traditionally, to evaluate the performance of a causal
learning algorithm, one needs to consider several parameters,
including the number of direct causal relations correctly identified
by the algorithm, the number of direct causal relations falsely identi—
fied by the algorithm, and the number of direct causal relations
whose direction was correctly determined by the algorithm (Spirtes
and Meek, 1995). Nonetheless, as our main purpose was to identify
the direct regulators of a target mRNNprotein, we sought to
evaluate the algorithm’s performance by the accuracy of its
prediction of a target’s regulators. We transformed the search for
direct regulators of an mRNA/protein target into a binary classifica—
tion problem of determining, for all measured ncRNA/proteins,
which are direct regulators of the target mRNNprotein, and which
are not.

To illustrate, consider a dataset D consisting of measurement for
a set V of ncRNAs, mRNAs and proteins. We sought to identify the
direct regulators of a target mRNA/protein T E V using using an al—
gorithm F. We first generated m resampled datasets from D, and
applied algorithm F to each of the m samples. Let S1, . . . Sm be the
m sets of candidate regulators of T identified by algorithm F from
the resampled datasets. We then counted, for each observed variable
X in V, how many times it was included in these m sets of candidate

regulators: f(X) : 2;”: 1 15,- X), where 15,- is the indicator function for
set 5,. Then we constructed a classifier based on algorithm P, so that
it would classify a ncRNA or protein X as a direct regulator of T if
f(X) 2 c for some pre—determined cutoff c.

The performance of a binary classifier can be conveniently eval—
uated by either the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve or
the Precision—Recall (PR) curve (Davis and Goadrich, 2006), which
could be considered as plots of the true positive rate against false
positive rate (ROC) or PR for various values of cutoff c. In the
context of regulator network learning, where the number of non-
regulators (negative cases) far exceeds the number of true regulators
(positive cases), it is highly desirable for a classifier to have high spe—
cificity to limit the number of false positives to an acceptable level.
Therefore, the PR curve would be preferred. Nevertheless, the ROC
curve could also be used if we restrict the ROC over a range of high
specificity, (e.g. between 0.95 and 1).

We created four simulated miRNA/mRNNprotein regulatory
networks, each consisting of 40 miRNAs, 80 mRNAs and 80 pro—
teins that are encoded by the mRNAs, based on Equations (1) and
(2). For each network, we generated random samples of sample size
1250, 250 and 50, respectively. For each sample we generated 25
datasets by sampling without replacement, and evaluated the per—
formance of MBSmRN (for mRNAs), MBSNIG (for proteins),
MMHC and Lasso—based algorithms on these resampled datasets,
using the method described earlier. Because the original Lasso—based
algorithm derived the regulators of mRNAs from the expression of
mRNAs and miRNAs, we also evaluated the Lasso—based algorithm
on the trimmed simulation data, where the protein data had been
removed. We found that the MBSNIG algorithm performed ex-
tremely well in predicting the regulators of proteins, even when the
sample size was only 50, as shown in the ROC curve and PR curve
for MBSNIG in Fig. 1 and Supplementary Figs. 85—7.

The performance of the MBSNIG algorithm for identifying regu-
lators of target proteins was also vastly superior to the MMHC and
the Lasso regression—based algorithms. For all simulated networks,
the average area under the Precision Recall curve (AUPRC) of the
MBSNIG—based classifier for 30 target proteins was already 0.89
when sample size was 50, and reached almost 0.99 when sample
size was 250 and 1000. This compared with an average AUPRC of
0.3 and 0.4 at sample size 50, and 0.5 and 0.33 at sample size 250,
respectively for classifiers based on the MMHC and the Lasso algo—
rithm (Supplementary Tables S1—4). We also observed a similar dif—
ference in partial area under the ROC curve (pAUC), over the range
of specificity between 0.95—1, between MBSNIG and the other two
algorithms (Table 1 and Supplementary Tables S2—4).

The MBSmRN algorithm also performed better than the
MMHC and Lasso—based regression algorithms in identifying regu-
lators of target mRNAs, although the performance advantage was
not as large as the MBSNIG algorithm for proteins (Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Figs. S5—7). Measured by AUPRC, the performance
of the MBSmRN—based classifier was always higher than that of the
MMHC algorithm. Measured by pAUC, at a sample size of 250 and
1250, the MBSmRN algorithm also exhibited significantly higher
performance than the Lasso regression—based algorithms. At a sam—
ple size of 50, the pAUC of the Lasso regression—based algorithm
was slightly better, although the difference was not statistically sig—
nificant. Note that the performance of the Lasso—based algorithm
significantly deteriorated as the sample size increased, which is not
surprising, given that this regression—based algorithm was incorrect,
as discussed earlier. We also noted that after removing the protein
data, the Lasso—based algorithm’s performance was severely
affected.

We also estimated the computational time needed for these algo—
rithms. Using an Intel Xeon 3.5 Ghz CPU with six threads, at sample
size of 50, for each mRNA target, the MBSmRN algorithm required
nearly 5 s, Lasso required N1 s, and MMHC <1 s. For each protein
target, the MBSNIG algorithm required N100 s, Lasso N2 s and
MMHC <1 s. The long computational times of the MBSmRN and
MBSNIG algorithms largely reﬂected poor performance of the iter—
ation loop in R, which was the language we used for these new algo—
rithms. An implementation of these algorithms in other languages,
such C or Java, could improve the algorithms’ computation speed
by one or two magnitudes.

3.2 Application
From the integrated miRNA—mRNA—protein dataset for tropho—
blasts cultured in standard or hypoxic conditions, we detected the
expression of 231 miRNAs, 26 223 mRNAs and lincRNAs, and
3268 proteins. Among them, we identified 215 miRNAs and 20 381
mRNAs and lincRNAs that were differentially expressed during the
time course and/or between standard or hypoxic culture conditions.
Using the generalized linear mixed effect model, we also found 324
differentially expressed proteins. The heatmaps for these differen—
tially expressed miRNAs, mRNAs, and proteins are shown in
Supplementary Figure S3.

The clustering of differentially expressed miRNAs/mRNAs/
proteins, (Fig. 2), revealed common expression patterns: Relative to

time 0, some miRNNmRNNprotein sets were up—regulated
throughout the experimental time course in both standard and hyp—
oxic conditions, while others were down—regulated under both con—
ditions. Other sets were down—regulated under standard conditions
but up—regulated in hypoxia; and some were up—regulated in stand—
ard conditions but down—regulated in hypoxia. A pathway analysis
of these different groups of proteins revealed the enrichment of net—
work functions involved in energy production, lipid metabolism and

functions, the most abundant were cellular growth and proliferation
(51 of 78 proteins, analyzed by Interactive pathways analysis,
Ingenuity Systems). The multi—dimension scaling plots of all
expressed miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins highlighted patterns of
mRNA/protein expression profiles in trophoblasts cultured in
standard or hypoxic conditions over the time course (Supplementary
Fig. S4).

We selected 78 proteins that were differentially expressed over
the time course, and/or between the standard and hypoxic condi—
tions by both the generalized linear mixed effect models and the
maanova algorithm (Kerr and Churchill, 2001). They all had a min-
imal average spectral count of 2 over all protein samples. We gener—
ated an integrated regulatory network for each of these 78 proteins
and their respective mRNA transcripts using the MBSmRN and
MBSNIG algorithms. Representative networks are shown in

networks, Supplementary Tables S5 and S6 provide the detailed in—
formation about the networks. We found that among the 231 ex—
pressed miRNAs, 132 miRNAs were present in the regulatory
networks of the 78 mRNAs, and 62 miRNAs were present in the
regulatory networks for the 78 proteins, with 31 miRNAs common
to the networks for mRNAs and proteins. Interestingly, there was
no significant correlation between the list of miRNAs that directly
regulated the mRNAs and the list of miRNAs that directly regulated
the proteins (P = 0.23, Fisher exact test).

4. Discussion

The examination of gene regulatory networks requires the distinction
between intracellular and multicellular (tissue or cultured cells) regu—
lation. An intracellular regulatory network describes, within an indi-
vidual cell, how variable levels of ncRNA, mRNA and protein
molecules interact with each other and, in particular, how the level
of some molecules affects the expression of other molecules. The
study of regulatory networks at the cellular level is often modeled by
differential equations based on production and degradation rates of
molecules. These models usually involve a small number of variables,
and are applied to single cell expression data (Munsky et al., 2012).
Multicellular regulation, on the other hand, centers on changes of
total expression of some molecules in a collection of cells, such as tis—
sues or cultured cells, and their impact on total expression of other
molecules. As previously shown (Chu, 2008), causal learning algo—
rithms cannot derive intracellular level regulatory networks using ob—
servational expression data, such as high throughput miRNA,
mRNA and protein data, generated from multicellular systems.
However, because of the complexity of regulation at the individual
cell level and the extensive communication among cells, it is usually
impossible to analytically infer a model of multicellular regulation

from knowledge of intracellular regulation. Nevertheless, it is feasible
to use high throughput expression data to infer regulation of ncRNA,
mRNA, and protein at the multicellular level, which is the focus of
the work described here. We proposed two new causal learning algo—
rithms for the inference of local ncRNNmRNNprotein regulatory
networks from high throughput expression profiling data. We
applied these algorithms to study primary human trophoblasts cul—
tured in standard culture condition or in hypoxia. Notably, hypoxia
was selected for its relevance to the pathobiology of placental tropho—
blasts during human pregnancy (Oh et al., 2011; Rob et al., 2005).

To address the challenge of a large number of ncRNNmRNN
proteins species and a small number of biological samples that is
typical of high throughput data, the two new algorithms adopted a
score—based local causal learning strategy. They first executed a
score—based search to identify the Markov blanket for the target
mRNA/protein, and then conducted a score—based search to select
the set of direct causes of the target mRNA/protein from the
Markov blanket. They inferred the Markov blanket and the direct
causes for each target mRNA/protein separately, without presenting
a complete causal structure that covers all ncRNAs, mRNAs and
proteins. When compared with the score—based global causal learn—
ing algorithms, such as the Greedy Equivalence Search (GES) algo—
rithm (Chickering, 2002), our new algorithms are computationally
efficient and allow the learning of local causal structure. When com—
pared with the constraint—based causal learning algorithms, such as
the PC algorithm (Spirtes et al., 2000), our algorithms have higher
sensitivity, because they do not require a large number of simultan-
eous statistical tests.

The MBSmRN algorithm utilizes the prior knowledge that in
most cases, a protein product is the only direct target of an mRNA.
This allows the use of the Splitting algorithm for the Markov
Blanket with known direct effects (SAMB-KDE) in the MBSmRN al-
gorithm, and enables the identification of the sets of direct causes

Fig. 2. Plots of clusters of differentially expressed miRNAs/mRNAs/proteins. A miRNA/mRNA/protein is considered differentially expressed if its expression had
changed during the time course under either the standard or hypoxic conditions. Expression values are averaged over the four placentas. Each plot represents a
cluster of miRNAs/mRNAs/proteins obtained using k-means algorithm. The number of clusters were selected to cover interesting patterns of miRNA/mRNA/pro-

teins expression, such as all members in a cluster were upregulated or downregulated in both conditions, or altered in one of the condition, and altered in the op-
posite direction in the other condition. Please note that some clusters did not follow any of these patterns. Also, note that there is no correlation among the three
plots in the same row. They represent clustering of miRNAs, mRNAs and proteins, respectively

and direct effects from the Markov blanket for an mRNA transcript
using a model selection method. In the MBSNIG algorithm, we took
advantage of the non—Gaussian distribution of the count data (e.g.
protein data generated by mass spectrometry), and developed the
POMB—NG data algorithm. As the next generation sequencing tech—
nology becomes more affordable, more and more ncRNA and
mRNA count data will be available. The MBSNIG algorithm can be
applied to these sequencing data to identify the direct regulators of a
target ncRNA/mRNA.

Our simulation study showed that the MBSmRN and MBSNIG
algorithms are clearly superior to two competing algorithms: the
MMHC algorithm and the Lasso regression—based algorithm. In par-
ticular, when searching for direct regulators of a target protein, the
MBSNIG algorithm performed very well at a sample size of 50,
which is comparable to the number of samples we have collected for
the study of trophoblasts response to the two culture conditions

over a 72 h time—course. Interestingly, at the smallest simulated sam—
ple size (50), Lasso regression—based algorithm performed at least as
well as the MBSmRN algorithm for identifying regulators of mRNA
targets. This is a typical example of the trade—off between variance
and bias: when the sample size is extremely small, due to its simplis—
tic approach to regulatory network learning, the Lasso—based algo—
rithm was able to compensate for the strong inherent bias by the
low variance of the estimated model.

We applied the new algorithms to integrated miRNA-mRNA—pro-
tein expression data for primary human trophoblasts. We believe that
a well—designed study for miRNA regulatory networks should include
protein expression data in addition to miRNA and mRNA expression
data. This is primarily because, as discussed earlier and confirmed by
the simulation study, missing protein data make it impossible to dis—
tinguish miRNAs that regulate target mRNAs from miRNAs co—regu—
lated with the target mRNA, hence diminishing the performance of

regulatory learning algorithms. Moreover, without protein data, it
would be impossible to identify those miRNAs that directly affect the
translation of proteins irrespective of mRNA degradation (Baek et al.,
2008)

One of the main weaknesses of the new algorithms is the linear-
ity assumption, which was needed in order to address the challenges
of a small sample size and high network complexity. Theoretically,
we could remove the linearity assumption and generalize our algo-
rithms by using nonparametric density estimation methods to derive
the Markov blankets for mRNAs and proteins. However, because of
the curse of dimensionality, this might never be practical for the
study of gene regulatory networks. The other assumption, the no—
feedback assumption, could be removed if we adopted a modified
Cyclic Causal Discovery (CCD) algorithm (Richardson, 1996).
However, the output of the CCD algorithm, which is called a partial
ancestral graph, usually does not allow an intuitive biological
interpretation. Alternatively, when time series data are available, dy—
namic Bayesian networks could be used to model the feedback rela—
tion (Perrin et al., 2003). However, we would then have to assume
stationarity and the correct choice of time points for measurement
(Chu and Glymour, 2008; Li et al., 2011; Yan et al., 2010). The
combination of the linearity and no—feedback assumptions limit the
application of our algorithms to cases where the regulators have an
approximately linear effect on its target, and the target does not
directly regulate its regulators.

We also highlight that the protein library size could affect the per—
formance of our two new algorithms. When the library size is small,
some proteins may not be detected. If these proteins happened to be
closely involved in the regulation of the target mRNA or protein, like
proteinz in our schematic example (Supplementary Fig. S1), our algo—
rithms might incorrectly identify miRNAs co—regulated with the
target mRNA or protein as regulators of the target mRNA or protein.
Despite the above limitations, we believe the new algorithms will pro-
vide a useful tool for biologists who are investigating biological net—
works and seek to identify direct regulators of mRNAs and proteins.

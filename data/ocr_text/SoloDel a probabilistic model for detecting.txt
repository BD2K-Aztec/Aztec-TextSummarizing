Abstract

Motivation: Finding somatic mutations from massively parallel sequencing data is becoming a
standard process in genome—based biomedical studies. There are a number of robust methods de—
veloped for detecting somatic single nucleotide variations However, detection of somatic copy
number alteration has been substantially less explored and remains vulnerable to frequently raised
sampling issues: low frequency in cell population and absence of the matched control samples.
Results: We developed a novel computational method SoloDel that accurately classifies low—
frequent somatic deletions from germline ones with or without matched control samples. We first
constructed a probabilistic, somatic mutation progression model that describes the occurrence and
propagation of the event in the cellular lineage of the sample. We then built a Gaussian mixture
model to represent the mixed population of somatic and germline deletions. Parameters of the
mixture model could be estimated using the expectation—maximization algorithm with the
observed distribution of read—depth ratios at the points of discordant—read based initial deletion
calls. Combined with conventional structural variation caller, SoloDel greatly increased the accur—
acy in classifying somatic mutations. Even without control, SoloDel maintained a comparable per—
formance in a wide range of mutated subpopulation size (10—70%). SoloDel could also successfully
recall experimentally validated somatic deletions from previously reported neuropsychiatric
whole—genome sequencing data.

and transposable element insertions (Helman et al., 2014; Lee et al.,
2012) have been focused in a number of disease genome studies,
which has led to a successful development of the relevant computa—
tional detection methods (Cibulskis et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2013;
Lee et al., 2012; Roth et al., 2012).

Somatic copy number alteration (SCNA) is one of the major
genomic aberrations frequently found in cancer (Beroukhim et al.,
2010; Chiang et al., 2009; Mermel et al., 2011). Several SCNA
detection algorithms have been developed based on read—depth com—
parison (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012; Koboldt et al., 2012; Xi et al.,
2010) and/or read—pair analysis (Chen et al., 2009; Rausch et al.,
2012) between tumor and matched control samples. While these
algorithms have successfully discovered a number of disease—
associated SCNAs, several hurdles still remain. First, many somatic
mutations reside only in a small population of the sample to be pre—
sent in a low allele fraction; this problem is well known as tumor
cellularity or tumor subclonality in cancer. Furthermore, non-tumor
diseases may harbor similar issues due to somatic mosaicism. For ex—
ample, remarkably low—frequent (down to a few percent) mutations
have been reported in brain diseases such as neuropsychiatric dis—
orders and neurodevelopmental malformations (Evrony et al., 2012;
Lee et al., 2012; Poduri et al., 2012, 2013). At this range, conven—
tional SCNA detection methods can be seriously compromised be—
cause their key evidence (read—depth discrepancy in disease—control
pair) is obscured; copy number changes occur only in a subset to
make only an insignificant difference in overall read—depth (Fig. 1b).
Consequently, these subtle read—depth changes are hardly distin-
guished from natural variance. Second, matched control samples
(e.g. blood, saliva or normal tissue) are not always available.
Genomic study of brain diseases is one typical case; because brain

tissues are usually collected posthumously, control samples are no
more available once they are missed in the initial design. For ex-
ample, only 22% of brain non-tumor (and 72% of brain tumor)
whole—genome samples deposited in the sequence read archive contain
matched—control information (Supplementary Table S1). Although
less frequent, there is still lack of matched control in general cancer
data including 59 case—only studies (2799 samples) archived in the
database of genotypes and phenotypes. This absence of control sam—
ples prohibits the use of current algorithms for SCNA detection.

We found the two critical problems, low mutational frequency
and absence of control, turn to be a rather solvable probabilistic
problem when considered simultaneously. A germline mutation is
expected to be observed in the entire population of the sample. So
the expected allele frequency of a germline mutation is 50% for het—
erozygous and 100% for homozygous events. And we expect
a broadly shared somatic mutation would represent a similar fre-
quency to germline mutations. On the contrary, if a somatic muta—
tion exists only in a subpopulation (e.g. 10% of the sample), the
allele frequency of its heterozygous mutation is expected to be much
lower (e.g. 5%); these frequencies are hardly expected in germline
mutations according to the binomial probability (that one haploid is
dominantly sequenced by chance) and can be separated without
control.

If we can catalog all existing somatic and germline mutations in
the sample, the overall allele frequency distribution can be utilized
to de—convolute somatic mutations in a subpopulation from the
others. However, the classification of somatic mutation among the
all cataloged mutations is also dependent upon the assumed subpo—
pulation composition; for example a 1% allele frequency is generally
a noise, but can be a successful somatic mutation candidate with a
2% sized subpopulation. So an efficient inference should be applied
to find the optimal list of somatic mutations with proper compos—
ition that maximizes the observation probability. Another problem
is interpreting the deviations in read—depth to a deletion call and its
frequency. Deletions in rare populations (<5 %) are difficult to be
distinguish from noises. Likewise, rich populations (>90%) are al-
most germline-like and hardly separated.

Here, we introduce a novel computational method SoloDel
(Somatic Low—frequent Deletion call model) to find low—frequent
somatic deletions with and without matched control data. We first
construct a probabilistic model of somatic mutation progression to
represent the composition of two subpopulation groups, normal and
mutated cells. Two types of model parameters, a rate of somatically
affected haploid p, (:a half of mutated subpopulation size assuming
that all somatic deletions are heterozygous) and a proportion of
somatic to total deletion is are defined for somatic deletions to show
the status of the mutated cell population and the number of somatic
deletions. We then fit the constructed model for a given sample with
the assumption that the sample consists of normal cells and mutated
cells. Optimal model parameters that maximize the observation
probability are estimated by applying the expectation-maximization
(EM) algorithms for Gaussian mixture model, which represent the
mixed allele frequencies of deletions from normal and mutated cells.
We accept the mixed model only if the likelihood of the estimated
model is higher than that of a simple germline model (subpopulation
free). Final somatic deletion candidates that show higher probability
to be somatic are selected based on the estimated model.

Using simulated data with various conditions, we demonstrated
that SoloDel accurately estimates the mutated subpopulation size
with an average error rate of 1%. False rejection of mixture model
only happened in near-germline samples. With the combined use of
external structural variation caller, we also showed that SoloDel

greatly improves the accuracy in terms of overall precision and recall
in the entire range of subpopulation size and total number of som—
atic deletions (100—1000). Moreover, the performance remained
consistent without matched control in a wide range of subpopula—
tion size (10%—70%). Finally, we could successfully recall experi—
mentally validated low—frequent somatic deletions from
neuropsychiatric disease samples. This implies that low—frequent
somatic deletions can also be recruited using our in silico probabilis—
tic model to alleviate high—priced and laborious deletion searching
procedures including nested—PCR and single cell sequencing.

2 Methods
2.1 Method outline

Overall workflow of SoloDel is shown in Figure 1. The input is
sequenced paired reads from a mixed disease sample, which contains
subpopulations of mutated cells. General preprocessing steps includ—
ing read mapping to the reference genome, sorting, removing dupli—
cate reads, and indexing are required. A resulted BAM file is fed to
the following processes.

The first step is an initial calling of deletion candidates. A called
candidate can be classified as (i) a germline deletion, (ii) a somatic
deletion or (iii) a false positive. False positives are predicted and fil—
tered out based on the sequence homology in the subsequent step.
Somatic deletions are further selected using a somatic progression
model with their parameters estimated based on the observed value
of called candidates. By using the estimated model, candidates that
have higher probability to be somatic than germline are considered
to be our final callset.

2.2 Initial calling of deletion candidates

Two major approaches, read—depth analysis (Abyzov et al., 201 1) and
read—pair analysis (Chen et al., 2009) have been generally applied for
germline deletion calling from NGS data. Unlike germline deletions,
particularly for non—tumor diseases, somatic deletions frequently exist
in a small fraction of a cell population. In this case, the performance
of read—depth analysis can be seriously compromised due to the insuf—
ficient read—depth deviation that is easily obscured by the sequencing
and mapping variances (Kim et al., 2013).

Most of the available read—depth based tools mainly target som—
atic deletions in cancer (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012; Koboldt et al.,
2012; Krishnan et al., 2012; Xi et al., 2010), leaving the aforemen—
tioned problem where no clear decline of read—depth is observed.
However, a number of anomaly (discordantly) mapped paired—end
reads can be obtained with a sufficient sequencing depth to indicate
the presence of somatic deletions (Fig. 1b). Therefore, we only used
the read—pair analysis method in our initial calling step to minimize
potential false negatives that come from the limited read—depth reso—
lution. Of the available read—pair based tool, we applied
BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009) and DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012)
in SoloDel for their accuracy of breakpoint mapping and popularity
of usage.

2.3 Filtration of false—positive candidates
Repetitive DNA sequences occasionally disguise the paired—end read
mapping to generate false deletion calls (Treangen and Salzberg,
2012). To reduce the false—positive calls, we defined the following
procedure that assesses the possibility of a deletion call resulting
from sequence homology using Blat alignment tool (Kent, 2002).
Assume that two ends of a paired—end read p:{1'1, 1'2} were
mapped to genomic locations g1 and g2 (g1 < g2), respectively, to call

a deletion. The gap between g1 and g2 is abnormally large, by defin-
ition, compared with the expected insert size 1' of the sequencing
data. We captured two read—length sized reference sequences
s1 :[g1 —i—i, g1 +i+len(r1)] and s2:[g2—i—len(rz), g2 —i], which
denote the possible alternative mapping sites that make p revert to a
concordant read (Supplementary Fig. 81). We compare the captured
sequences s1 and $2 to their corresponding read sequences 72 and 71
to check if they match exactly and continuously in >90% of the re-
gions. Finally, deletion calls that captured sequences are matched to
their alternative sites (s1 matches 72 or $2 matches 71) are filtered out.
The remaining calls are considered as a mixture of high confident
germline and somatic deletions.

2.4 Somatic deletion generation model

To represent the status of generated deletions of a given sample, we
defined a probabilistic model for somatic deletion generation
(Fig. 2). In the development of normal tissue, precursor cells are
replicated and generate daughter cells that possess identical compos—
ition of germline deletions of precursor cells. Those inherited germ—
line deletions are denoted by Dg. However, if a somatic event is
occurred during the development, somatic deletions are generated
and affect to subordinate cells. These affected cells additionally pos—
sess the set of somatic deletions denoted by DS.

A somatic event affects the constitution of somatic deletions in
two ways. First, the time of a somatic event decides the rate of dele—
tion-harboring haploid, defined as p : {pg, 1),}. The population of
the mutated cell that contains somatic deletions is represented by
this parameter. Second, the scale of a somatic event decides the pro—
portion of deletion loci, defined as Xzﬂg, is}. The number of gener—
ated deletions is represented by this parameter.

All cells possess identical composition of germline deletions. For
germline deletions, the expected pg is 0.5 and 1.0 for heterozygous
and homozygous deletions, respectively. We hypothesized that the
probability of somatic homozygous deletions (two independent som—
atic deletions occur at the exactly same genomic loci) is ignorable.
Therefore, the rate of somatically affected haploid, 1),, is bounded
between 0 and 0.5.

The number of heterozygotic germline deletion, N g, and somatic
deletion, N5, is depicted by the blue and red lines in the genome
(Fig. 2). The proportion of germline and somatic deletion loci, 2g

Fig. 2. Defined model of somatic deletion generation. (a) During the normal
development process, daughter cells replicated from precursor cell inherit
identical composition of germline deletions (blue dots and lines). However,
subpopulation of cells can obtain somatic deletions (a red dot and line) by a
somatic event during the development. (b) A somatic event affects the com-
position of somatic deletion in two ways in a fully developed tissue. The time
of a somatic event determines the population of mutated cells (the number of
cells with red backgrounds), and the scale of a somatic event determines the
number of generated somatic deletions (the number of red lines in the
genome). Both aspects are reflected by the model parameters—a rate of som-
atically affected haploid (p5) and a proportion of somatic to total deletion (25).
The figure shows an example of a mixed tissue with p5: 0.2 (mutated subpo-
pulation size is 0.4) and 2520.25 (Color version of this figure is available at

of deletion loci, Ng—i— NS. Through the defined parameters, p and X,
the status of generated deletions of a given sample can be
represented.

2.5 Probabilistic estimation of deletion candidates

with observed values

For each deletion candidate d,- that passed the sequence homology
filter, we can calculate the reduced depth of predicted region (x,)
and the total depth of ﬂanking region (11,-) (Fig. 3a). To select som—
atic deletion candidates, classification of true somatic deletions from
germline heterozygous deletions is indispensible.

For given observed values 11,- and x,, we can consider each value as
the sequence of independent trials and the number of successes of the
binomial distribution. Then, probability of a deletion with observed
values can be estimated by the binomial probability mass function:

B(x.—;n.-,p) = ("’I>pxi(1 — p)”"""’ (1)

x1

As d,- can either be a germline heterozygous deletion or a somatic de—
letion, the success probability p of binomial distribution follows the
rate of deletion—harboring haploid, pg and 1),, for each case.

read (n,-, x,-). (b) The point estimates [3,- (blue dots) are hypothesized to be
derived from the Gaussian mixture model of two groups, somatic and germ-
line heterozygous deletions (left). The mean value and the weight of each
Gaussian distribution indicate p and x1, respectively. Estimation of the par-
ameters is performed by the EM algorithm. Based on the estimated param-
eters, likelihoods of the mixture model (left) and the germline model (right)
are compared. If the likelihood of mixture model is higher, somatic scores
(8;) are calculated. (c) Deletion candidates, that is 8,->0, which indicate
higher probability to be somatic than germline, are selected as final candi-
dates (red dots) (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics
online.)

The probability that d,- is from the germline heterozygous deletions
or the somatic deletions follows the ratio between the number of
germline heterozygous deletions and somatic deletions, 2g and 25.
Therefore, the probability of a deletion for given observed values 11,-
and x,- can be obtained as follows.

Given 0 : {p, X}, the likelihood function is derived by the prod—
uct of probabilities of independent deletion candidates with
observed values.

2.6 Estimation of model parameters and selection of
somatic candidates

For the estimation of p and X, we applied the EM algorithm based on
the Gaussian mixture model (Fig. 3b). For each deletion candidate d,,
we first calculated the point estimates {3,- for the rate of deletion—
harboring haploid by dividing observed values. Candidates from germ—
line homozygous deletions that show 131- close to 1 are filtered out.

13.- = ﬂ (5)
711'

Since we assumed binomial trials for the observed values 11,- and
x,, each trial follows the Bernoulli distribution with success prob—
ability p. The p can be either pg or 1), depending on the origin of a
deletion, then the point estimate 13,- is the sample mean of given
Bernoulli trials. Therefore, distribution of the point estimates {3,- for
all deletion candidates will be approximately Gaussian by the cen—
tral limit theorem.

We hypothesized that the point estimates 131- are derived from the
Gaussian mixture model of two groups: somatic and germline het—
erozygous deletions.

To estimate the parameters of Gaussian mixture model, we
applied the EM algorithm with the number of components [322.
Estimated mixture model parameters directly represent the param—
eters of deletion model (p, 14). Using the estimated parameters, likeli-
hoods of mixture and germline models are calculated as follows:

germline heterozygous deletions. If the likelihood of mixture model
is higher, then we accept the mixture model and calculate the som—
atic candidate score (5,):

Deletion candidates with S,- > 0 are selected as final somatic deletion
candidates. In other words, the most likely explanation for the ori-
gin of these deletions is a somatic subpopulation, not a highly devi—
ated sequencing from a uniform sample.

Overall processes in SoloDel were implemented as a Java—based
single program utilizing open source libraries including Picard,
SAMtools (Li et al., 2009), and other libraries for advanced

mathematics.

2.7 Generation of simulation data

To test the performance of SoloDel, we generated multiple sets of
simulated data with widely varying core parameters. Datasets were
created with various ranges of mutated subpopulation size and the
number of generated somatic deletions, which correspond to model
parameters 1), and 25, respectively. Subpopulation size was varied
from 0% to 100% with 10% intervals, and the number of generated
somatic deletions varied from 100 to 1000 with 100 intervals. Each
number of homozygous and heterozygous germline deletions was
fixed to 1000. A total of 110 simulation datasets were designed to
be generated based on the combination of two variables.

For each simulation dataset, we generated two set of diploid gen—
omes, one for normal genome that only contains germline deletions
and another for mutated genome with germline and somatic dele—
tions together. All simulated genomes were derived from the refer—
ence genome of human chromosome 1 (hg19) by introducing
random deletions. The size of introduced deletions was randomly se—
lected between 500 bp to 10 kb. Generation of simulated genome
was implemented by Python.

GemSim (McElroy et al., 2012) was used to generate paired—end
reads from the simulated genomes based on the Illumina paired—end
error model. The number of required paired—reads was calculated
based on the planned mean coverage (70X). A total of 86 000 000
paired reads were generated for each simulation dataset. Among
them, the relative abundance of the mutated genome was calculated
according to each assigned subpopulation size. All generated paired—
end reads were mapped using Burrows—Wheeler Aligner (Li and
Durbin, 2010) and merged into one alignment (BAM) file for each
dataset. Merging, sorting, removing duplicates and indexing of
alignment (BAM) file were performed using SAMtools software
package (Li et al., 2009). The resulting BAM files for each dataset
were tested to SoloDel and several previous SCNA detection algo—
rithms (Boeva et al., 2011, 2012; Rausch et al., 2012; Xi et al.,
2010). For the performance measure of SoloDel, two different exter—
nal initial callers BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009) and DELLY
(Rausch et al., 2012) were tested to avoid the performance bias by
initial callers. The performances of all methods were compared in
precision, recall and F—score.

3 Results

3.1 Estimated results of model parameters

We first examined the accuracy of parameter estimation for our
probabilistic model with simulation data. Estimation results for all
simulation datasets from SoloDel with BreakDancer are visualized
in the heat map to represent the performance (Fig. 4a). Each cell of

the heat map indicates one simulation subtype defined by a combin—
ation of p, and 25. To evaluate the accuracy of the acceptance/
rejection call for the mixture model, we generated a negative test set
from a mutation—less cell population (0%, 1),: 0) and a fully
mutated cell population (100%, 1),: 0.5) with no matched control
provided; these are the cases for the germline model and should be
rejected for the mixture model.

A perfect model should accept the mixture model for all datasets
except the negative sets (pS : 0 and p5 = 0.5). We found that SoloDel
successfully rejects the mixture model for the negative cases, with
only a few reporting false rejections at the near germline area
(1), = 0.4 to 0.45). To clarify the false rejection of mixture samples,
we plotted the mis—rejected Gaussian mixture distributions (Fig. 4b).
With the low numbers of generated somatic deletions (NS), most
somatic distributions were covered with the large germline distribu—
tion due to the small difference of mean values between two distri—
butions. Although the mutated subpopulation size is large (p, = 0.4
and p5 = 0.45), germline and somatic distributions were clearly clas—
sified when the dataset possesses a large enough number of somatic
deletions. For datasets with small subpopulation size, which are in
the main hotspot for SoloDel, mixture models were accepted per—
fectly for all cases.

The gradient of each heat map cell represents the accuracy of the
estimated parameter 1),. As the minimal deviation of true 1), between
generated datasets is 0.05, accuracy for cases that deviations
between true and estimated 1), above 0.05 are assigned to zero and
depicted as white color. If the estimated 1), is exactly matched to the
true 1),, the accuracy is assigned to 1. The average of the absolute de—
viation between true and estimated 1), was less than 0.005 (1% of
the mutated subpopulation size), representing the robustness of the
parameter estimation of SoloDel. Even with the false rejected data—
sets, estimations of 1), were successfully achieved regardless of the
acceptance of mixture model. Estimated parameters (1),, 25) with
true values are shown in Supplementary Table S4. SoloDel with
DELLY also showed similar results, which represent the unbiased
performance of parameter estimation (Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.2 Performance tests of somatic deletion calling

To evaluate the performance of somatic deletion calling, we ran
SoloDel and previous SCNA detection methods to all simulation
datasets and predicted somatic deletion candidates for each data.
We referred to a recent evaluation study (Alkodsi et al., 2014) to se—
lect high performing previous methods for comparison including
BIC—seq (Xi et al., 2010) and Control—FreeC (Boeva et al., 2011,
2012). Other high-ranked tools from the referred review have been
considered but finally excluded from the comparison; VarScan2
(Koboldt et al., 2012) and COPS (Krishnan et al., 2012) were tested
but had too low accuracy due to their oversegmentation, and
SegSeq (Chiang et al., 2009) only works on single—end reads. Besides
the reviewed tools, BreakDancer and DELLY were also included ac—
cording to their stated availability of SCNA calling with matched
control data. In a test, we considered a result is correct if the
genomic coordination of predicted somatic deletion reciprocally
overlapped the corresponding true somatic deletion in more than
50%. Based on this criterion, precision, recall and F—scores were
measured. All deletions generated in simulation have been hidden
and reserved.

We note two major advantages of SoloDel compared with previ—
ous methods: (i) accurate separation of low—frequent somatic dele—
tions and (ii) discrimination of somatic deletions from unmatched
sequencing data. Since none of the previous methods support the

Fig. 4. Estimated results of model parameters. (a) Each cell of the heat map represents a specific type of simulation dataset. The color of each cell indicates the ac-
ceptance of mixture model (blue for acceptance, red for rejection), and the gradient represents the accuracy of the estimated parameter ps. The gradient is set to
zero and shown as white color if the deviation between estimated and true p3 is above 0.05. The maximum deviation of estimated p3 was 0.01688, which shows ro-

bust performance of parameter estimation. (b) Distribution of somatic and germline deletions are plotted as red and blue lines for the cases with p3: 0.3 and 0.45.
Compared to datasets with small subpopulation size (left), most somatic distributions of datasets with large subpopulation size (right) are covered with the germline
distribution, which cause the false rejection of mixture model. With the enough number of generated somatic deletions, germline and somatic distributions from

the large subpopulation size are also clearly classified by the mixture model of SoloDel (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

latter, SoloDel’s performance in this condition is unrivaled.
Therefore, we divided the evaluation process in two steps. First, we
used simulation dataset with matched control to compare the per-
formances between previous methods and SoloDel (lines in Fig. 5
and Supplementary Fig. S3). And second, we assessed the perform-
ances of SoloDel without matched control data to measure its ro-
bustness (circles in Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S3).

In the test on dataset with matched control, SoloDel with read-
pair methods outperformed other tools in most conditions (Fig. 5,
blue and orange solid lines). As expected, read-depth based methods
(BIC-seq and Control-FreeC) hardly detected somatic deletions with
small subpopulation size (<30%), even after applying an inherent
contamination rate estimation, due to the insufficient read-depth de-
viations. DELLY (without SoloDel) kept high precision along with
the change of subpopulation size; however, a significant drop in re-
call was observed with small subpopulation size (<30%). We as-
sume that the loss of sensitivity resulted from the absence of
subpopulation information (mixture rate) to cause a false filtration
of true somatic deletions with a small number of supporting reads.
When DELLY was combined with SoloDel, the problem has been
successfully addressed (blue lines in Fig. 5). BreakDancer showed al-
most similar performances to those with SoloDel, but was slightly
lower in precision due to a few false-positive calls. Application of
SoloDel successfully removed those noises and increased precision
(orange lines in Fig. 5 ). We also confirmed the consistent outper-
formance of SoloDel regardless of the generated deletion size
(Supplementary Figs S4 and S5).

Finally, we found that SoloDel without matched control (Fig 5,
blue and orange circles) performed almost comparably (to with
matched-control), except only at high somatic portions (>80%).
Again, note that separation of somatic from germline mutation without
control becomes theoretically intractable as being close to 100%. From
this point of View, SoloDel’s initial rejection of mixture model can be
the best estimate of the sample composition. Moreover, when a suffi-
cient number of deletions exist in a sample (Fig 5, later), SoloDel was
able to rescue most of the true somatic deletions with high precision
even at a near-germline sample (>80% somatic portion).

A few recent studies have reported potential somatic mutations
from unmatched data by applying a naive threshold of allele fre-
quency (Jamuar et al., 2014; Lim et al., 2015). Although target
genes were considerably limited and intensive experimental valid-
ations were followed in previous studies, such threshold-based clas-
sification possesses several inherent problems. First, an arbitrarily
selected threshold does not have logical basis to support its validity,
and second, compulsive application of an arbitrary threshold can
cause high rate of false positives, especially critical to mutation-less
samples. We confirmed superior overall performance of SoloDel
compared with the naive threshold-based method for unmatched
data (Supplementary Fig. S6). Besides the outperformance, SoloDel
can overcome those problems by providing rationale for threshold
estimation based on the somatic progression model and mixture
model examination with likelihood comparison. All taken together,
we demonstrated that SoloDel accurately identifies somatic dele-
tions of various mutational frequencies (subpopulation size and total
deletion number) and availability of matched control based on the
rational estimation processes.

3.3 Performance tests on simulated data with multiple
subpopulations

In SoloDel, the estimation of mixture model was performed based
on the assumption that the data are derived from two independent
Gaussian distributions. However, in the real disease samples, the
generation of multiple subpopulations has been continuously re-
ported (Ding et al., 2012; Gerlinger et al., 2012; Greaves and
Maley, 2012). We thus tested the performance of SoloDel with the
data composed of multiple subpopulations.

We constructed simulation data with multiple subpopulations
based on the real tumor case previously reported (Ding et al., 2012).
In the previous work, authors found the clonal evolution patterns
that consist of four subclones in the tumor sample and measured
their relative abundance by analyzing mutant allele frequencies of
somatic point mutations from whole-genome sequencing data. We
clonal with measured

reproduced this evolution patterns

Fig. 5. Performance comparison with the previous methods for somatic deletion detection. Precision, recall and F-score are depicted for all tested methods with
the datasets from three different numbers of somatic deletions (100, 500 and 1000). Performance measurements with matched control data are represented by
lines with different colors and shapes for each tested method. Regardless of the type of external initial caller, SoloDel (blue and orange solid lines) outperformed
other tools for the most simulated datasets. Performances of SoloDel without matched control data are represented by circles for each initial caller and showed

comparable results to performances with matched control data except for the datasets at a near-germline area. For datasets with small subpopulation size,
SoloDel outperformed other tools even without matched control data (blue and orange circles) (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

abundances of subclones to the simulation dataset by introducing
somatic deletions (Fig. 6a and Table 1). The number of introduced
deletions was decided based on the rate of validated mutations for
each subclone in the previous work. Performances of BIC—seq,
Control-FreeC, DELLY and BreakDancer with matched control
data were compared with that of SoloDel without matched control
for this multiple subclone data.

BIC—seq failed to report any somatic deletions from every sub—
clones. Although the data consist of multiple subpopulations,
SoloDel showed acceptable performance with the estimation based
on the mixture of two subgroups (somatic and germline). In the per-
formance comparison, overall measurements of SoloDel outper—
formed those of Control—FreeC and DELLY regardless of the type of
initial caller (Fig. 6b). Although Control—FreeC showed good per—
formance in precision, most somatic deletions from subclone P3 and
P4 were missed. DELLY detected substantial number of somatic de—
letions from P3, but lost all deletions from P4. Combined with
SoloDel, DELLY recovered a part of somatic deletions from sub—
clone P4 that consists of less than 5% of cell population. This result
indicates the importance of appropriate model estimation for the de—
tection of somatic deletion with small subpopulation size. Only
BreakDancer showed comparable results, but performances of
SoloDel were achieved without matched control information. With
multiple subclone data, we confirmed again the competitiveness of
SoloDel compared with previous methods.

3.4 Somatic deletion calling on neuropsychiatric data

Detecting low—frequent somatic deletions in the real data is a chal—
lenging problem. Most previous studies have searched and validated
the existence of somatic deletions based on the SNP arrays, which
cannot capture somatic deletions with small subpopulation size (Lee
et al., 2012; O’Huallachain, et al., 2012). A recent study reports the
detection of low—frequent somatic deletions in neuropsychiatric

samples with the conservative approach based on the manual inspec—
tion (Kim et al., 2014). Although they only focused on a small num—
ber of somatic candidates with high probability, a few of them were
experimentally validated by Sanger sequencing and single cell
sequencing of deletion breakpoints.

We applied SoloDel to the real whole—genome sequencing data
from the previous study, composed of two schizophrenic brain and
two normal brain data with the absence of matched control infor—
mation. Mixture models were accepted for all samples, indicating
the presence of mutated subpopulation with somatic deletions. A
total number of 287 and 238 somatic deletion candidates for normal
brains and 382 and 346 candidates for schizophrenic brains were
called by SoloDel, compared with the predicted number of 29 and
18 candidates for normal brains and 15 and 18 candidates for
schizophrenic brains in the previous study. Although called results
of SoloDel may include a certain amount of false positives, much
higher number of calls than previous study was expected according
to the declared risk of excessive false negatives due to the intensive
minimization of false-positive rate (Kim et al., 2014). Differed from
the result of previous work, more number of somatic deletion candi—
dates were called from the schizophrenic cases, which may suggest
the relationship between the number of occurred somatic deletion
and the onset of disease.

We then examine the called candidates to confirm somatic dele—
tions that were validated in the previous study. Table 2 shows the
called results for the previously validated candidates. Among the six
validated somatic deletions, five were successfully called as somatic
by SoloDel. One exceptional candidate was classified as germline;
however, mis—classification was due to the corrected penalty of high
variance of read—depth at the predicted region of deletion. Validated
somatic deletions covered a broad range of somatic portion, sup—
porting unbiased confirmation of called results from SoloDel.

4 Discussion

In this article, we developed a novel computational method SoloDel
for detecting low—frequent somatic deletions with and without

matched control samples. We defined a probabilistic model for som—
atic deletion generation and estimated model parameters using EM
algorithms to provide the criteria of classifying somatic deletion can—
didates. Compared with previous methods, we showed outstanding
performances of detecting low—frequent somatic deletions with vari—
ous simulation datasets. With the real sequencing data, we success—
fully recalled experimentally validated somatic deletions confirmed
by the previous study, supporting the reliable performance.

Recent studies have been increasingly reporting the contribution
of low—frequent somatic mutations to the onset of various diseases
including neuropsychiatric diseases (Lee et al., 2012; Lim et al.,
2015; Poduri et al., 2012, 2013; Shirley et al., 2013). However, con—
firmed list of low—frequent somatic mutations are still limited due to
the lack of detecting methods, insufficiency of matched control in-
formation and difficulty of experimental validation. Advances of
new techniques such as single cell sequencing and targeted ultra—
depth sequencing will allow us to fill up the catalog of low—frequent
somatic mutations. Decline of sequencing cost and growth of inter—
est for the somatic analysis will increase the datasets with matched
control and improve the quality of somatic call. With enough num—
bers of secured gold standards, the development of computational
tools for accurate detection of somatic mutations will be followed.

There are several issues to enhance the detecting ability of
SoloDel. To detect low—frequent somatic deletions as intended,
enough coverage of whole—genome sequencing data is indispensable.
Initial calling of deletion candidates that completely depend on the ex—
ternal callers is another issue to improve. Consideration of polyploidy
that affects the estimation of subpopulation size may also elevate the
performance of SoloDel by using GC content normalization (Boeva
et al., 2011). In spite of the issues for improvement, SoloDel showed
considerable results compared with the conventional methods even
with the harsh conditions, which makes it applicable for identifying
low—frequent somatic deletions of many challenging cases.

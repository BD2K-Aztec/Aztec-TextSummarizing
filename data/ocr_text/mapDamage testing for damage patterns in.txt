ABSTRACT

Summary: Ancient DNA extracts consist of a mixture of contaminant
DNA molecules, most often originating from environmental microbes,
and endogenous fragments exhibiting substantial levels of DNA
damage. The latter introduce specific nucleotide misincorporations
and DNA fragmentation signatures in sequencing reads that could
be advantageously used to argue for sequence validity. mapDamage
is a Perl script that computes nucleotide misincorporation and
fragmentation patterns using next-generation sequencing reads
mapped against a reference genome. The Perl script outputs are
further automatically processed in embedded R script in order to
detect typical patterns of genuine ancient DNA sequences.
Availability and implementation: The Perl script mapDamage
is freely available with documentation and example files at
http://geogenetics.ku.dk/all_literature/mapdamagel. The script
requires prior installation of the SAMtools suite and R environment
and has been validated on both GNU/Linux and MacOSX operating
systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬁeld of ancient DNA (aDNA) has a colorful history, with
early claims of DNA survival from the Cretaceous (Woodward
et al., 1994) periods later recognized as the by-product of
contamination (Zischler et al., 1995). Extensive fragmentation
and substantial chemical modiﬁcations of nucleotide bases are
introduced post-mortem as a result of DNA damage (Paabo, 1989).
Some of these modiﬁcations, such as abasic sites, single-strand
breaks and interstrand cross-links, are not replicated by standard
Taq DNA polymerases (Hansen et al., 2006; Mitchell et al.,
2005), hence the relatively better preserved modern contaminant
DNA molecules will often outcompete ancient templates during
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) ampliﬁcation. For non—human
species, contamination can be controlled by using speciﬁc PCR
primers and/or human oligonucleotide PCR blockers (Gigli et al.,
2009) and by ﬁltering out human-related sequences. But as long as

ancient human fossils are concerned, including close relatives such
as neandertals, contamination is still a risk.

Several recent methodological improvements have helped
improve reliability when sequencing ancient hominids. Firstly, DNA
libraries are tagged in clean labs with project-speciﬁc indexes in
order to track back downstream contamination sources that could
result from library ampliﬁcation and/or sequencing (Briggs et al.,
2007). In addition, typical sequence patterns resulting from aDNA
damage have been identiﬁed that help distinguish damaged ancient
sequences from modern contaminants; these include: short sequence
length; an excess of cytosine to thymine (C—to-T) misincorporations
at 5’ ends of sequences, and complementary guanine to adenine
(G-to-A) misincorporations at 3’-termini, due to enhanced cytosine
deamination in single stranded 5’-overhanging ends (Green et al.,
2009; Krause et al., 2010); and an excess of purines at the genomic
coordinate located just before the sequencing start, indicative of
post-mortem depurination, followed by strand fragmentation (Briggs
et al., 2007).

Here, we present a Perl script that analyzes the size distribution
of next-generation sequencing reads, and dynamically recovers
nucleotide misincorporation patterns in a position-dependent
manner. In addition, the base composition of the genomic regions
located up- and downstream of each read is recorded within windows
of user-deﬁned sizes. Using SAM ﬁles as input and corresponding
reads mapped against a reference genome, the script mapDamage
provides summary tables required to gauge aDNA authenticity based
on DNA damage patterns.

2 RESULTS

Script outline: the following programs must be installed prior
to running mapDamage: SAMtools (Li et al., 2009a) and the R
environment (R Development Core Team, 2010) that generates user-
friendly tables and graphics using downstream scripts. Three main
commands can be used to run mapDamage: map, merge and plot. The
main command, map, takes as input a SAM ﬁle (if present, headers
with @SQ lines will be skipped) and the reference genome used to
map next— generation sequencing reads as a fasta ﬁle. Corresponding
genomic regions from the reference are retrieved using SAMtools
and aligned to sequencing reads using the CIGAR information (Li
et al., 2009a). The merge command compiles, in single tables, all
individual tables generated with the map command for individual
chromosomes. These tables can be further processed with the plot
command that produces graphics without any requirements of R
knowledge. The global pipeline is described in the Supplementary
Figure 81.

mapDamage options:

(1) map command, a second SAM ﬁle may be supplied with -j.
Reads present in the ﬁrst SAM ﬁle will be considered as
long as missing from the second SAM ﬁle. This option is
particularly useful to remove potential human contaminants
when shotgun sequences from a non-human organisms are
generated.

(2) map command, by default, the maximum length of reads is
set to 70 nt. This could be adjusted using -1.

(3) map command, the size of the genomic window located
upstream and downstream of the reads is set by default to
10 nt but can be changed with the -a option.

(4) map command, read alignments against the reference genome
considered are output in a fasta format when the -f option is
used.

(5) map command, multithreading is controlled by the -t option.

(6) map command, the option -u will remove the non-unique hits
based on the optional ﬁeld ‘XA’ for alternative hits from BWA.

(7) map command, Via -d, users can provide the name of the
subfolder where all output ﬁles will be stored.

(8) merge command, -d option indicates the main folder where
individual ﬁles generated with the map command are stored.

(9) plot command, users may change the range of the y-axis
in nucleotide misincorporation graphs with -m option. The
number of nucleotides to plot for the read and reference
regions are controlled through options -1 and -a, respectively.

Runtime: the map command is the most-time consuming step,
as it requires multiple disk access. Typically, ca. 650 000 reads
are processed within 6h on a laptop with 8 GB RAM and a quad
core 1,6 GHz processors. For optimal performance, several threads
should be used. Both merge and plot commands are performed
within a few minutes.

Outputs: Typical ﬁle outputs with corresponding examples
are described in details at http://geogenetics.ku.dk/all_literature/
mapdamagel. Brieﬂy, the map command outputs seven ﬁle
categories for each chromosome plus the length distribution per
strand. The merge command outputs seven tabular ﬁles compiling
the previous information for the whole set of chromosomes. Finally,
plot outputs one pdf ﬁle and the respective R script corresponding
to fragmentation and misincorporation patterns.

Application on the paleo-Eskimo Saqqaq genome: the ﬁrst ancient
human genome was sequenced on Illumina GAIIx platforms to
20X average depth (Rasmussen et al., 2010). DNA libraries were
PCR ampliﬁed with Phusion polymerase in order to limit nucleotide
misincorporations resulting from cytosine deamination (Fogg et al.,
2002). An additional lane of sequencing data was generated from
a DNA library ampliﬁed with the Platinum Taq DNA polymerase
High Fidelity (Invitrogen). From the latter, after tag trimming and
duplicate template removal, a total number of 15 918 505 sequences
were generated but were not included in the ﬁnal genome assembly.
One million sequences were randomly selected and mapped against
the human genome (hg19, obtained from UCSC Genome Browser)
using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009b) with default parameters.
Resulting SAM ﬁles were ﬁltered for a minimum mapping quality
of 25 with SAMtools (Li et al., 2009a) resulting in 626 425 uniquely

mapped reads. Regarding the age of this specimen, i.e. 4000 years,
cytosine to thymine misincorporations are drastically increased at 5’ -
termini when using a Hiﬁ Taq DNA polymerase (Supplementary Fig.
S2, top right), suggesting a substantial level of cytosine deamination
was present in the ancient human DNA fragments. In contrast,
random sampling of 1 million sequences from 15 179 000 sequences
generated on one GAIIx lane using a Phusion ampliﬁed DNA library
resulted in 610 149 unique maps against hg19. The damage pattern
showed a 3.8-fold reduction considering the 25 ﬁrst nucleotides
of cytosine to thymine misincorporation (Supplementary Fig. S2,
top left), suggesting that the selection of a single enzyme, here
Phusion polymerase, drastically improved the quality of the genome
by neutralizing DNA damage-related nucleotide misincorporations.
The DNA fragmentation pattern remains unaffected with an excess
of purines at the genomic position preceding the read start
(Supplementary Fig. S2, bottom).

3 DISCUSSION

mapDamage reports DNA damage patterns in sequences generated
from aDNA using next-generation sequencing platforms. We
have validated the script both on simulated sequence datasets
with signiﬁcant levels of DNA damage (Priifer et al., 2010;
Supplementary Fig. S3) and on real aDNA datasets. With
mapDamage, nucleotide misincorporations driven by cytosine
deamination can be easily observed and quantiﬁed. Similarly, the
nucleotide position at which aDNA molecules have been fragmented
can be monitored. The complete set of analyses can be performed
globally, or per chromosome or DNA strand in order to detect
possible skews. In addition, coverage information is provided
in hitPerChrom ﬁles that report the total number of nucleotides
sequenced on each strand and per chromosome. In summary,
mapDamage provides useful summary tables, which together with R
plotting script (or other data analysis software), extracts information
for authenticating aDNA based on DNA damage signatures.

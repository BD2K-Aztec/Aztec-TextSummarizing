Abstract

Motivation: Genes with indispensable functions are identified as essential; however, the traditional
gene-level studies of essentiality have several limitations. In this study, we characterized gene es-
sentiality from a new perspective of protein domains, the independent structural or functional units
of a polypeptide chain.

Results: To identify such essential domains, we have developed an Expectation—Maximization (EM)
algorithm-based Essential Domain Prediction (EDP) Model. With simulated datasets, the model pro-
vided convergent results given different initial values and offered accurate predictions even with
noise. We then applied the EDP model to six microbial species and predicted 1879 domains to be es-
sential in at least one species, ranging 10—23% in each species. The predicted essential domains
were more conserved than either non-essential domains or essential genes. Comparing essential do-
mains in prokaryotes and eukaryotes revealed an evolutionary distance consistent with that inferred
from ribosomal RNA. When utilizing these essential domains to reproduce the annotation of essential
genes, we received accurate results that suggest protein domains are more basic units for the essen-
tiality of genes. Furthermore, we presented several examples to illustrate how the combination of es-
sential and non-essential domains can lead to genes with divergent essentiality. In summary, we
have described the first systematic analysis on gene essentiality on the level of domains.

1 Introduction

Genes are Widely regarded as the basic units of a cell, a complex sys-
tem made up of a large number of components and reactions.
Therefore, a fundamental question in synthetic biology is, what is
the minimal gene set that is necessary and sufficient to sustain life

(Mushegian, 1999)? The individual genes that constitute a minimal
gene set are called essential genes. Experimentally, essential genes
are defined as those that when disrupted, confer a lethal phenotype
to organisms under defined conditions. Therefore, the essentiality of
a gene is the indispensability of this gene’s product to the survival of

a microorganism. Systematic genome-wide interrogations of essen-
tial genes have been conducted by single-gene knockouts (Baba
et al., 2006; de Berardinis et al., 2008; Kato and Hashimoto, 2007;
Kobayashi et al., 2006), transposon mutagenesis (Akerley et al.,
2002; Gallagher et al., 2007; Gerdes et al., 2003; Glass et al., 2006;
Hutchison et al., 1999; Jacobs et al., 2003; Liberati et al., 2006), or
antisense RNA inhibitions (Forsyth et al., 2002; Ji et al., 2001).
These experiments have provided a tremendous amount of resources
to further our understanding on gene essentiality, one important
step closer to unraveling the complex relationship between genotype
and phenotype (Dowell et al., 2010).

Recent comparative research on the available essential gene data-
sets has shown surprising results and has challenged many early as-
sumptions in genomics. First, it was discovered that microorganisms
share a limited set of essential genes. For example, a comparison of
the essential gene sets of four bacteria revealed that only 12—72% of
essential genes are shared between any pair, indicating that a large
number of unique essential genes exist (Supplementary Table 51).
This is somewhat expected as independent studies have firmly estab-
lished that bacterial species share a very limited number of orthologs
(e.g. 19—5 3% in Supplementary Table 51), regardless of which
ortholog detection method is used (Bruccoleri et al., 1998). This
may reﬂect the physiology of diverse microorganisms. Increasing the
number of organisms in the list will further decrease the number of
orthologs and thus common essential genes. For example, merely
265 orthologs and 34 essential genes are common to all four bac-
teria (Supplementary Fig. 51). It is highly unlikely that these 34 es-
sential genes would be capable of executing all functions of a cell.

Second, and more surprisingly, a recent study showed that, when
tested experimentally in model bacteria, less than a quarter of the
highly conserved genes were essential (Arigoni et al., 1998; Freiberg
et al., 2001; Song et al., 2005; Zalacain et al., 2003). This suggests
that evolutionary conservation of a gene does not necessarily imply
that it is essential for microbial survival. Consider a hypothetical
bacterium that utilizes both solar and chemical energy. Although the
genes for converting solar and chemical energy have been highly
conserved and optimized (thus allowing them to be conserved
through evolutionary time), neither is essential for survival if both
solar and chemical energy are present.

Finally, orthologs are often observed to be essential in one organ-
ism but not another. For example, the dapE gene is essential in
Escherichia coli but non-essential in Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Gerdes
et al., 2006). It is also possible for orthologs to have different func-
tions in different organisms (Liao and Zhang, 2008), even though it is
a fundamental assumption of genomics that most orthologs perform a
similar function. This suggests that differences in genetic regulation,
genetic redundancy and divergence in cellular pathways or processes
between organisms may all affect gene essentiality; their combined ef-
fects result in the discrepancy in essentiality between orthologs.

Given the above evidence, a theoretical approach that attempts
to identify a universal minimal gene set by searching for conserved
orthologs across multiple organisms is unlikely to succeed. Since
relying on orthologs, or conservation on the gene level, does not ad-
equately explain essentiality, are there other characteristics among
different organisms that are more consistent with essentiality?
Observing that genes from different evolutionary origins perform
the same function (i.e. non-orthologous gene displacements), a
group of researchers switched their focus to defining the set of essen-
tial functions (Delaye and Moya, 2010; Gil et al., 2004). However,
knowing a set of essential functions does not necessarily mean that
the genes responsible for these functions can be easily identified, es-
pecially in understudied organisms.

In this study, we have reexamined gene essentiality from a novel
essential protein domain point of view. Our results suggest that this
new perspective may offer unique insights into the mechanistic basis
of gene essentiality and help to resolve the controversy regarding
this phenomenon.

Protein domains with known function, such as those of the
ATPase enzyme class (Jaroszewski et al., 2009), are amino acid se-
quence patterns with an associated activity. They often correspond
to structural domains, the independent globular components of the
polypeptide chain found in three-dimensional protein structures, al-
though the correspondence is not exact (Zhang et al., 2005).
Independent of neighboring sequences, a protein domain folds into a
distinct structure and mediates the protein’s biological functionality
(Kanaan et al., 2009) (Supplementary Fig. 52). Protein domains can
be detected from gene/protein sequences by well-established algo-
rithms, such as HMMER (Finn et al., 2011). Currently, the Pfam
v.27.0 database contains 14 831 domains detected by HMMER,
many of which have unknown functions (Finn et al., 2010).

We hypothesized that gene essentiality is likely preserved
through the function of protein domains or domain combinations,
rather than through the conservation of the entire genes. Numerous
examples can be found in literature to support this postulation. For
instance, there is only a single copy of DNA polymerase III subunits
r and 32 domain III (PF12169) (Jergic et al., 2007) in E.coli,
Raeruginosa and Bacillus subtilis. The host gene of this domain,
dnaX, is essential in all three species; however, the sequence identity
between them is low (Supplementary Fig. 52). In further support of
modularity within essential genes, previous studies have discovered
that although a gene as a whole may be essential, not every domain
within the gene is required for the essential function. For example,
E.coli ftsK (b0890) is an essential gene consisting of two domains:
the N-terminal (a.a. 1—780) and the C-terminal (a.a. 781—1329).
Only the N-terminal domain of this gene is required for its role in
cell division and viability (Wang and Lutkenhaus, 1998). This study,
among others, provides direct evidence that protein domains may be
responsible for the essentiality of a gene.

The structure of this paper is as follows: In the Section 2, we de-
scribe the data sources and give the details of the Essential Domain
Prediction (EDP) model. In the Section 3, we first assess the per-
formance of the EDP model on simulated datasets. We then use the
EDP model to predict essential domains in six microbes, detailed do-
main information can be found in Supplementary Table 52. Next,
we investigate the properties of these predicted essential domains,
such as their conservation and functions. We also use these essential
domains to reproduce the annotation of essential genes as a valid-
ation of our predicted essential domains and present several cases
where literature provides support for our predictions. In the Section
4, we discuss the significance of our research, the advantages of ex-
plaining gene essentiality from a domain perspective, and possible
improvements that can be applied to our EDP model.

Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 sequence data were collected
from the Pseudomonas Genome Database (http://www.pseudo-
monas.com/) (Pseudomonas_aeruginosa_PAO1.faa, revision 2009-
07-17). PA essential genes were acquired from (Winsor et al., 201 1).
The Jacobs dataset contains 678 essential genes from transposon
mutagenesis experiments in PAO1.

Acinetohacter haylyi ADP1 sequences were downloaded from
the Magnifying Genomes Database (http://www.genoscope.cns.fr/
agc/mage). Out of a total of 3308 genes, 499 essential genes were
adopted from (de Berardinis et al., 2008).

Bacillus subtilis sequence data were collected from Microbial
Genome Database (http://mbgd.genome.ad.jp/). This dataset con-
tains 4117 ORFs. The essential gene list was obtained from
(Uchiyama et al., 2010) and consists of three datasets: 150 essential
genes detected with Kobayashi’s mutant genesis experiments, 42
known essential genes from previous studies, and 79 essential genes
by homology mapping to other bacteria, most of which encode pro-
teins involved in ribosome or synthesis.

Saccharomyces cerevisiae sequences were acquired from
5accharomyces Genome Database (http://downloads.yeastgenome.
org/sequence/genomic_sequence/). This resource contains 5885
ORFs. The essential gene list was obtained from (Giaever et al.,
2002). This dataset contains 1049 essential genes from targeted mu-
tagenesis experiments.

Neurospora crassa ORFs were adopted from Neurospora crassa data-
base at Broad Institute (httpd/vvwwbroadinstituteorg/annotation/ gen-
ome/neurospora/MultiDownloadshtml). Dubious ORFs and pseudo
genes were excluded from this list. Essential gene data was kindly pro-
vided by K. Borkovich from the systematic genome deletion project in N.
crassa at UC Riverside. This list contains 1251 essential genes.

Gene ontology (GO) annotations for domains were downloaded
from the Mappings of External Classification Systems to GO (http://
www.geneontology.org/GO.indices.shtml).

2.2 The domain dataset and data filtering

We used Pfam (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk/; Punta et al., 2012) to de-
rive domain information from protein sequences, and Pfam-A
entries are combined with Pfam-B entries to construct our domain
dataset. In total, 3629 Pfam-A and 5098 Pfam-B domains were
included in our analysis. Genes that had no domain annotation were
excluded, leaving a total of 23 009 genes. Specific numbers of genes
and domains for each species are shown in Table 1.

2.3 The essential domain predictor (EDP) model

We defined G = {g1,g2,  ,gn} for a genome with 11 genes. For
g,, i E (1, 11), let g,= 1 if the ith gene is essential, and 0 otherwise.
The vector G was obtained from the experiments, which was
treated as observed data. Suppose gene g,- is annotated with n,- dif-
ferent domains, we define D(gi) ={Di1,Di2,  ,D?i}. Here vari-
able Di 2 1 for being an essential domain, and 0 otherwise, where
(i, i) denotes the ith domain of the ith gene. The values of D1 are
unobserved and treated as missing values, which will be estimated
by the model. Each protein may include multiple distinct domains
and one type of domain may occur in different proteins. We
defined D 2 {D1, D2, . . . ,Dm} for all the unique domains that can
be found in a given genome, where D1221, la 6 (1, m) for an
essential domain, and 0 otherwise. We also defined
5 = {51,52,  ,Sm}, where Sk, la 6 (1, m) is the set of lath unique
domain Dk in the whole genome. We use |Sk| to denote the size of
the set Sk, and we further define 6k as the probability of domain
Dk to be essential.

We further included two kinds of errors that may exist in the
prediction process: falsely predicted essential rate (FER) and
falsely predicted non-essential rate (FNR). The definitions are as
follows:

FER=Pr(pi = 1 | 81:0), FNR=Pr(pi =0 | 81 = 1), (1)

where p,: 1 if the ith gene is predicted to be essential and 0
otherwise.

The goal of this model is to estimate the parameters set (9 to
maximize the likelihood of observed essential genes. Since it is diffi-
cult to directly optimize L(G|0), we augmented the observed likeli-
hood L(G|0) with missing data D, and the complete data likelihood
is thus defined as: L(G,D|0)=L(D|0)L(G|D,0). The formulas are
further derived as:

m 5k, Dk = 1
L(D )0) = HLk where, Lk = (2)

where FER and FNR are defined as Formula (1) and
(9 = (6k, FER, FNR). Under this framework, we adopted the conven-
tional Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm (Hastie et al., 2001)
to compute the optimal (9 that maximizes L(G|0). The EM algorithm is
derived as follows:

E-step: during the E step of the tth iteration, D is updated by the
conditional expectation given the estimated (9 from last iteration

Note: The number of domains and genes in each dataset are shown, as well
as the essential count of each type.

2.4 Test EDP model with different initial values

The initial values of the EM-algorithm may influence the result of
the model. For the EDP Model, three parameters are given by initial
values: the probability that one domain is essential
D = {D1,D2,  ,Dm}, the falsely predicted essential rate (FER)
and falsely predicted non-essential rate (FNR). The initial value of
Dk is set to be the percentage of essential genes in all genes that con-
tain domain k. We fixed the initial value of D and tested the influ-
ence of different FERs and FNRs on the results of the EDP Model.
Six pairs of FER and FNR values were tested, and the final result of
the EDP Model was convergent as long as the dataset remained
constant.

2.5 Building the domain clustering matrix

The matrix describes the existence and essentiality of all domains in
the six species. The values for the matrix elements are as follows: 1
for an essential domain, —1 for a non-essential domain, and 0 if no
domains were found. Here we evaluate the distance between species
based on the Mutual Information of the domains’ essentiality. For
species X and Y, the Mutual Information I (X; Y) is:

“X; W = Z M an (1)—(£13),

yEY xEX

and the distance between X and Y is D(X,Y) = 1 — I (X;Y). The boot-
strapping values of each branch are evaluated by randomly selected
400—5 00 domains to rebuild the evolution tree for 1000 times.

3 Results

3.1 Testing the essential domain prediction (EDP) model
using simulated datasets

Based on the Expectation—Maximization (EM) algorithm, we de-
signed the EDP Model (see Section 2 for details) to predict the essen-
tiality of each domain. To test the performance of the EDP Model,
we generated 20 independent simulated datasets, each of which con-
tains 1200 genes and 1000 domains (Supplementary Fig. 53) and are
provided in Supplementary Files. Previous study has shown that the
number of domains for each gene follows a power-law-like distribu-
tion (Karev et al., 2002), and we found the same distribution in the
combined gene-domain annotation for the six microbes
(Supplementary Fig. 54A). Therefore, we required that the degree of
genes and domains in the simulated datasets follow a power-law dis-
tribution (Supplementary Fig. 54B). For each dataset, we randomly
assigned a certain number of essential domains, and then assigned
essential genes if and only if the gene contains at least one essential
domain. Among the 20 simulated datasets, the number of essential

domains ranged from 50 to 83, while the number of essential genes
ranged from 120 to 164.

We then applied the EDP Model to these simulated datasets, re-
vealing only the essential gene labels and gene-domain association.
When given different initial values (discussed in Section 2), the EDP
Model produced convergent results for each simulated dataset. The
results from the 20 simulated datasets were then compared to the
original assignment of essential domains (Supplementary Fig. 55A).
All pre-assigned essential domains were correctly predicted, i.e. no
false negative (FN) predictions, while the false positive rate (FPR) is
~0.4. All false positive (FP) assignments were the results of the same
scenario: a domain appeared in only one gene and that gene was
essential. Additionally, we annotated the essentiality of genes recip-
rocally based on the predicted essential domains, and no false pre-
dictions were made (Supplementary Fig. 55A).

Next, we added noise to the simulated data and repeated the pre-
diction process. The noise data included 10 genes, five were anno-
tated as essential but contained no essential domains, and the
remaining five were annotated as non-essential but contained at
least one essential domain. When adding ‘noise genes’ to the dataset,
the number of domains that a noise gene contained was randomly
determined and followed the same degree distribution as the ‘real
genes’ in the dataset. The errors for repeated predictions are also
shown in Supplementary Figure 55A. For essential domain predic-
tion, the number of PP errors remained almost the same and even
decreased in some cases (due to the influence of noise genes). The
FPR increased slightly because of the loss of true positives, which be-
came FN errors. Each of these was caused by the addition of noise
genes. As for the re-annotation of genes based on predicted essential
domains, 16 simulated datasets had no incorrect essential gene as-
signments and four of them had only one, each of which were noise
genes. The number of FN predictions ranged from 8 to 17, including
3—5 noise genes (Supplementary Fig. 55B). The test on simulated
data shows that the EDP model offers an accurate prediction of es-
sential domains, even with substantial noise.

3.2 Predicting microbial essential domains using the
EDP model

After testing the predictive capability of the EDP Model on simu-
lated datasets, we applied it to predict essential domains in real data-
sets, which included six microbes: E.coli (EC), A. haylyi (AB),
Raeruginosa (PA), B.suhtilis (B5), S.cerevisiae (5C) and N.crassa
(NC). Essential gene annotation for these species were collected and
filtered, excluding genes that do not have annotated domains in
PfamA or PfamB (see Section 2). After filtering, we obtained 23 009
genes and 8727 domains (3629 from PfamA and 5 098 from PfamB)
in total. The number for each species is shown in Table 1.
Considering that gene essentiality differs across species, we applied
the EDP Model to each organism separately.

We first tested the influence of initial parameters of the iterative
EM algorithm on its ability to converge. There are three parameters
in the EDP Model: domain essentiality, falsely predicted essential
rate (FER) and falsely predicted non-essential rate (FNR) (defined in
Section 2). Specifically, we obtained the initial essentiality of do-
mains by computing the percentage of essential genes associated
with each domain. To test the inﬂuence of changes in the FER and
FNR, we generated six pairs of FERs and FNRs, and compared their
convergence process to the final results within each species. As
shown in Supplementary Figure 56, all processes converged within
50 steps, including the pair with an FER of 0.9 and an FNR of 0.8.
This result indicated that the iterative process produces stable results

A novel essential domain perspective

for all datasets despite wide variation in the initial FER and FNR
values.

Based on the distribution of domain essentiality scores, we set
the cutoff for essentiality to 0.9 for the final prediction. Thus, when
we generated the set of essential domains, we accounted for 10—
23% of the total number of domains in different species (Table 1).
We found that the number of essential domains was much larger in
eukaryotes than prokaryotes. We identified 713 essential domains in
SC and 1009 in NC, while the numbers were 350, 247, 141 and 314
for AB, EC, BS and PA, respectively. This difference was not caused
by the variation in gene numbers; the number of genes in our pro-
karyotic dataset was similar to that of the eukaryotic dataset. For
example, PA and 5C have 4654 and 4116 genes, respectively. We in-
terpreted this phenomenon to be a consequence of the increased
complexity of eukaryotic genomes. In order to increase the number
of essential functions in a genome without increasing the size (gene
count), there must be an increase in functionally essential ‘core’
components, i.e. essential domains.

3.3 The conservation of essential domains

The microbes used in our study differ in both the number and type
of their associated genes and domains, as well as the essentiality of
these components. To further analyze conservation patterns, we
built a phylogenetic tree based on ribosomal RNAs (165 rRNAs for
prokaryotes and 185 rRNAs for eukaryotes; Supplementary Fig. 57)
and used this as the gold standard for assessing evolutionary dis-
tance among species. Based on this phylogenetic tree, we see that the
six microbes form three groups: NC and SC in the fungi group, AB,
PA and EC in the Gram-negative group, and B5 in the Gram-positive
group.

Concurrently, we clustered these species based on domain essen-
tiality. We used a matrix to represent the association between do-
mains and species, where rows are domains and columns are
microbes. As shown in Figure 1, domains are assigned different col-
ors according to their existence and essentiality (see Section 2). We
then applied hierarchical clustering on the columns to group the mi-
crobes. The clustering result closely resembled the rRNA-based
phylogenetic trees, i.e. AB, EC and PA are closest to each other, B5
is the outlier of the prokaryotes, and the fungi group is separated
from the prokaryotes. This result suggests that the conservation pat-
tern of domains is highly indicative of the evolutionary distance
across species.

The conservation of non-essential domains also contained evolu-
tionary information. We further compared the conservation level be-
tween essential and non-essential domains. In this comparison,
domain D would be considered as conserved between two species if
it is present in both species without limit on which gene domain D is
found. The comparisons were made between every pair of the six
species (Fig. 2A). In general, essential domains were more conserved
than non-essential domains. The odds ratio of the percentage of con-
served domains is also correlated with the evolutionary distance
among species, that is, more closely related species tend to have a
higher odds ratio. For example, the three highest odds ratios were
shared among AB, PA and EC, all members of the Gram-negative
group. The lowest three odds ratios were found between 5C and B5
(1.187), NC and B5 (1.312), 5C and PA (1.47), each comparison be-
tween a eukaryote and a prokaryote. This result suggests that essen-
tial domains are highly correlated with the species specificity — the
more closely related two species are in evolutionary distance, the
more essential domains they tend to share rather than non-essential
domains.

Fig. 2. Essential domains are more conserved than non-essential domains or
essential genes. Comparisons between species pairs are made. The percent-
age of essential domains conservation is compared with non-essential do-
mains in (A), and with essential genes in (B). Fisher’s exact test was used to
assess the significance, and test results are labeled in each of the subfigures

We further show the difference in domain copy numbers be-
tween essential and non-essential domains in the six genomes as fol-
lows. According to the UniProt database, there are multiple copies
of most domains in each of the six species. The number of copies of
a domain in a genome is indicative of its prevalence in that species.
We compared the detected frequency between essential and non-
essential domains in each species using a Wilcoxon Rank Sum test
(Fig. 3). In all six species, the non-essential domains were present in
a significantly higher frequency than essential ones. Furthermore,
the occurrence of non-essential domains tended to be more frequent
in the eukaryotes (5C and NC). This result provides additional sup-
port for the conservation of essential domains. If one considers do-
mains to be the building blocks of proteins, essential domains are
the key components that constitute an organism’s core functions
and would therefore be more likely to be conserved during

Fig. 3. Frequency of non-essential domains and essential domains in different
species. The detection frequency of each domain in six microorganisms is
shown in boxplot. Frequency of essential domains (ES Domain) is compared
with non-essential domains (NES Domain) in each species. The Wilcoxon
signed-rank test is used to specify the significant difference between essential
and non-essential domains in the same species

evolution. On the other hand, non-essential domains are more like
decorative blocks and evolve much faster to enable the organisms to
diversify and to better adapt to a complex environment, which
makes them less conserved across species and present in higher copy
numbers within a genome than their essential counterparts.

In our analysis, essential domains were identified based on essen-
tial genes, and we found that essential domains are more conserved
than essential genes. Here we focused on prokaryotic genes and do-
mains to maintain the conservation of essential genes. Two genes
from different bacteria are considered ‘conserved genes’ if they are
mutual best hit in reciprocal BLAST and have a sequence similarity
higher than 30%. Between any two bacteria, the percentage (inter-
section to union) of conserved essential domains was higher than es-
sential genes (Fig. 2B). The odds ratios were between 4.52 (AB and
EC) and 10.31 (PA and B5). Like the relationship between essential
and non-essential domains, the difference between essential domains
and essential genes were also correlated to the species similarity: the
more closely related two species were, the more significant the dif-
ference between the number of conserved essential domains and
conserved essential genes would be. This result provides additional
support to the idea that essential domains are more conserved than
essential genes, and are therefore likely more basic units responsible
for the essentiality of genes.

3.4 Results of single domain genes

From Supplementary Table 53 we can see that in all the six species,
the result of Fisher’s exact test suggests that when we evaluate a
gene’s essentiality, the single-domain genes would not influence the
process. We also compared with a simpler and straightforward
method: select all single-domain essential genes and assign these do-
mains as essential. Then we check the percentage of non-essential
genes in multi-domain genes which include essential domains.
Compared with EDP model (shown in Supplementary Table 53),
this simpler method would generate many more false predictions.
Supplementary Table 54 shows results of paralogous genes in differ-
ent species. In all six species, although there are only a small number
of genes with a differently annotated paralogous gene, they made up
the majority of false evaluations on the essentiality of genes.

3.5 Functions of essential domains

Compared with non-essential domains, would essential domains
be more frequently related with certain biological functions?
We performed GO enrichment analysis for domains that are essen-
tial for at least one species. In total there are 48 GO terms signifi-
cantly highly enriched in essential domains (adjusted P-value < 0.05,
Supplementary Table 55). We grouped these functions in larger

branches and show their percentage in essential domains in Figure 4.
GO terms which are also enriched in domains that are essential for a
given species are shown in the figure. These enriched functions are
mainly related with metabolic process, including heterocycle meta-
bolic and organic substance biosynthetic process.

Given that essential domains are correlated with species related-
ness, we subsequently investigated whether the functions are related
with species. To simplify the analysis and also because these three
species have many essential domains in common (Fig. 2), we com-
bined the domains in PA, AB and EC together into Gram-negative
group (GN). All domains were then further grouped according to
their essentiality in the following species (or groups): GN, B5, NC
and 5C. For some of these groups, GO enrichment analysis also
showed significantly enriched functions related to the corresponding
species’ feature. For example, the lipid A biosynthetic process
(GO:0009245) was enriched in GN-specific essential domains, while
the GPI anchor biosynthetic process (GO:0006506) was enriched in
NC- and 5C-specific essential domains (Supplementary Table 56). In
domains that were found non-essential in NC but essential in SC,
the transcription factor TFIIA complex (GO:0005672) was en-
riched. This TF is necessary for the initiation of gene transcription in
eukaryotes, but only got one copy in SC and had at least two copies
in NC. The DNA polymerase III complex (GO:0009360) was en-
riched in domains that were only essential in prokaryotes, while the
RNA biosynthetic process (GO:0032774) was enriched in conserved
essential domains in all groups. Further study of the enriched func-
tions of domains with various conservation levels and essentiality
patterns will reveal the characteristics of each species and their
unique requirement of essential functions.

3.6 Annotate gene essentiality using essential domain
We identified each domain’s essentiality designation using that of
the gene(s) to which it belongs. Reciprocally, we tried to reproduce
the annotation of essential genes based on these predicted essential
domains. The rationale is that if we can accurately reproduce the es-
sential gene annotations based on essential domains, there are two
implications: First, the EDP model has made accurate predictions of
essential domains. Second, gene essentiality can be adequately ex-
plained from a protein domain perspective. For each species, we
annotated the essential genes based on essential domains: that is, we
assigned to a gene the label ‘essential’ if and only if it contained at
least one essential domain. Those genes that did not contain any es-
sential domains were labeled ‘non-essential’. We then compared the
assigned essential genes with the observed essential genes in each
species. As shown in Figure 5, the ‘reproduced essentiality’ of genes
is highly consistent with the observed cases. As a control, we ran-
domly assigned the essential labels to genes in the real dataset
(labeled ‘random’ in Fig. 5), and used the EDP model to produce a
set of ‘essential domains’ based on this randomized dataset. When
comparing the area under the ROC curves (AUCs) of the essential
gene estimates using real data versus random data, we found that
the essential domains based on the real dataset produced signifi-
cantly more accurate annotation for essential genes (Student’s
t—test). We also combined all six datasets and tested the prediction
on essential genes with a nested cross validation. We randomly take
10% of data out, train the EDP model on the rest 90% with a 10
fold cross-validation and then test the trained model on the previous
10% data. The test is repeated for 10 times, and the result is shown
in Supplementary Table 57. This result suggests that gene essential-
ity can be adequately explained from a protein domain perspective,
and thus protein domains are likely more basic units that are respon-
sible for gene essentiality.

3.7 Literature support of the predicted prokaryotic
essential domains

We investigated further some of the essential domains we predicted.
Below we will present several cases to illustrate how these domains
could be used to explain gene essentiality (Fig. 6).

The first case includes two domains, PF00294 and PB003571.
The domain PB0035 71 is annotated by PfamB with unknown func-
tion but is predicted as an essential domain. All genes contains this
domain are essential genes, including B5U35 740, PA4996,
YGR277C and NCU05 311 and all these genes contain only this do-
main except for PA4996. This result is consistent with a recent re-
port, in which Goodacre et al. found that many essential genes in
microbes contain only one domain without known function
(Goodacre et al., 2014). Also, this domain is conserved among four
microbes which differ a lot in taxonomy, indicating a significantly
important function it may have. At the same time, the other domain
PF00294 which is also found in essential gene PA4996 is predicted

Fig. 6. Examples that essential domains could explain gene essentiality. The
annotation of domains for each gene is shown in lines and boxes, while es-
sential genes and domains are filled with black

as non-essential, for its function of pka family carbohydrate kinase
is not that important, and could be found in many non-essential
genes including b1723, ACIAD1992 and B5U14390.

The second case includes four domains. PF03120 and PF00533
are predicted as essential domains while PF00633 and PB002244 as
non-essential. PF03120 is the DNA ligase OB domain, which is ne-
cessary for the ligation of DNA fragments during DNA duplication,
repair and recombination. These functions are necessary for organ-
isms to survive, and genes containing this domain are all essential
genes, such as ACIAD0848 PA1529, b2411 and B5U06620. As for
PF005 33, the BRCT domain that is conserved in proteins involved
in cell cycle checkpoint function is also predicted as essential do-
main. On the other hand, PF00633 is the helix-hairpin-helix DNA-
binding motif, which is related with the interaction between protein
and DNA. The function of that domain is not indispensable, since
ACIAD0848 could also function in DNA repair process without
PF00633’s present. And even contains this domain, like B5U25590,
won’t make it essential as well.

The last case also includes four domains: PF00986 is the essential
one, and PF02518, PF01751 and PB011111 are the non-essential do-
mains. PF00986 is the carboxyl terminus of DNA gyrase B subunit,
and is responsible for the ATP-independent relaxation during the
complexation of DNA gyrate process. This function is important dur-
ing DNA duplication, and many genes contains this domains could be
inhibited by antibiotics(Engle et al., 1982). Many genes containing
this domain are essential, such as ACIAD004, b3030 and b3699. It’s
worth noting that in E.coli there are two copies of that domain, how-
ever the evaluation of its essentiality has not been effected.

Most interestingly, the EDP model seems to be able to tolerate
mistakes in the original essential annotations. We found that the
PA3987 gene contained the same domain as PA3834, PA4560,
b0026, b0642, ACIAD3106 and ACIAD0022. There other genes are
all essential for the organisms, and it’s odd that PA3987 alone is a
non-essential gene. The non-essential annotation was from the dataset
produced by (Jacobs et al., 2003). In their experiment, only one trans-
poson insertion, which did not change the reading frame, was
observed within PA3987. It is well recognized that a single transposon
insertion is often insufficient to disrupt a gene’s function, and this can
result in false annotation of essential genes (Deng et al., 2013).
Therefore, the annotation based on this transposon mutagenesis is
highly likely to be a false-negative error. Our EDP model correctly
predicts the PF00133 domain to be essential despite the error in this
annotation based on the transposon mutagenesis.

4 Discussion

Although protein domains have been sought in determining the
mechanistic basis of some essential genes, to our knowledge, large-
scale analysis of essentiality from a protein domain perspective has
not been attempted. In this study, using well-defined essential gene
datasets in six microorganisms, we have developed an EM algo-
rithm-based EDP model to evaluate the gene essentiality from a pro-
tein domain perspective.

We demonstrated that, when tested with simulated data, the
EDP model was capable of identifying essential domains and could
tolerate the disturbance of substantial noise. Further application of
this model to both prokaryotic and eukaryotic datasets led to the
identification of hundreds of essential domains in each organism.
There are several interesting findings based on the analysis of these
domains. First, essential domains are highly conserved among spe-
cies, not only more so than non-essential domains, but to a higher
degree than essential genes as well. This result suggests that essential
domains may play the role of ‘functional bricks’ during the evolu-
tion of genes, which would be constrained through evolutionary
pressure and undergo few changes. Second, conserved essential do-
mains perform species-related functions, such as the lipid A biosyn-
thetic process shared among gram-negative bacteria. Third, domain
essentiality can be used to accurately reproduce the annotations of
essential genes, and can even be used to test the results of the trans-
poson mutagenesis datasets.

The EDP model could be inﬂuenced by the following factors and
may be further improved for use in our future studies. First, the cross
talk between domains may affect the EDP model’s accuracy.
According to the study of Vogel et al, certain domain pairs might be
highly associated to occur in genes together (Vogel et al., 2004). In
these cases, these protein domains are more likely to be estimated as
non-essential if their related genes were not all essential. In some ex-
treme situations, the combination of domains might even generate
novel functions (Bashton and Chothia, 2007; Dessailly et al., 2009)
and thus result in different essentialities. This would impact the con-
servation of domain’s essentiality when species were analyzed separ-
ately, or bring false predictions of essential domains when using
combined datasets from multiple genomes.

Second, the estimation of domain essentiality can be improved.
For example, in the EDP Model, FER and FNR are estimated
based on the entire dataset (both essential genes and domains)
(Equation 1). However, FER and FNR influence each domain’s es-
sentiality score when re-estimating the probability for each domain
to be essential (Equation 4). As a result, applying the EDP Model on
two separated gene-domain associations may produce different re-
sults when this data is combined and the model is run again.

Third, the performance of the EDP Model is dependent upon the
quality of the dataset. Although we have shown that it is capable of
tolerating noise to some degree, the quality of the input data will in-
evitably affect the accuracy of the predictions.

Despite some limitations, there are several advantages of an es-
sential domain-centric versus gene-centric approach to gene essenti-
ality: First, essential domains are more basic functional units than
essential genes. Many genes consist of multiple domains that carry
out distinct functions. Employing an essential domain concept will
allow us to pinpoint which function is essential. The seemingly di-
verse mechanistic basis of essential genes and higher-order essential-
ity, e.g. synthetic lethality, may be revealed and united. Second,
essential domains are more transferable between organisms. EC and
PA share <20% of their genes (orthologs), but they share more than
50% of their domains. Third, essential domains are more scalable

than genes. Recently, it was discovered that although the number of
multi-domain architecture families (MDAs) is growing rapidly over
time, the number of single-domain architecture families (SDAs) ap-
pears to be reaching a saturation point (Levitt, 2009). Nearly all
novelty comes from the arrangement of known SDA domains along
an MDA sequence (Levitt, 2009).

In summary, with these new insights gleaned from the study of
essential domains, it will become possible to discover the funda-
mental principles that govern gene essentiality, which will lead to
the eventual deciphering of the complex relationship between
genotype and phenotype. Furthermore, unraveling the mechanistic
basis of gene essentiality will provide crucial information on cell
physiology and lead to drastic improvements in our ability to effi-
ciently re-engineer microorganisms. This will have applications on
many fronts, including energy, biodefense, pharmaceuticals and
bioremediation.

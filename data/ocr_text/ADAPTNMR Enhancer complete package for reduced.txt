ABSTRACT

Summary: ADAPT-nuclear magnetic resonance (ADAPT-NMR) offers
an automated approach to the concurrent acquisition and processing
of protein NMR data with the goal of complete backbone and side
chain assignments. What the approach lacks is a useful graphical
interface for reviewing results and for searching for missing peaks
that may have prevented assignments or led to incorrect assignments.
Because most of the data ADAPT-NMR collects are 2D tilted planes
used to find peaks in 3D spectra, it would be helpful to have a tool that
reconstructs the 3D spectra. The software package reported here,
ADAPT-NMR Enhancer, supports the visualization of both 2D tilted
planes and reconstructed 3D peaks on each tilted plane. ADAPT-
NMR Enhancer can be used interactively with ADAPT-NMR to auto-
matically assign selected peaks, or it can be used to produce
PlNE-SPARKY-like graphical dialogs that support atom-by-atom and
peak-by-peak assignment strategies. Results can be exported in vari-
ous formats, including XEASY proton file (.prot), PINE pre-assignment
file (.str), PINE probabilistic output file, SPARKY peak list file (.list) and
TALOS+ input file (.tab). As an example, we show how ADAPT-NMR
Enhancer was used to extend the automated data collection and as-
signment results for the protein Aedes aegypti sterol carrier protein 2.
Availability: The program, in the form of binary code along with tutor-
ials and reference manuals, is available at http://pine.nmrfam.wisc.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the goals of protein nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR)
spectroscopy is to increase its throughput by automating the
steps of data collection, spectral assignment and structure deter-
mination. The latest approach towards this goal from our la-
boratory is ADAPT-NMR (Bahrami et al., 2012), a software
package that interfaces with the NMR spectrometer and uses
an algorithm for devising a pathway for optimal data collection
to approach the goal of complete data assignment. As new data
are collected, ADAPT-NMR analyzes the set of data collected
up to that point and chooses the next step for data collection.
Each data collection step involves choosing a 3D NMR experi-
ment and a particular tilted plane that will identify peaks in the
3D spectrum. ADAPT-NMR incorporates an earlier approach

to fast data collection, HiFi-NMR (Eghbalnia et al., 2005) and
an algorithm for automated probabilistic assignment, PINE-
NMR (Bahrami et al., 2009). The output from ADAPT-NMR
is a probabilistic assignment table and analysis of secondary
structure. As a means for visualizing the spectral data, picked
peaks and spin system assemblies underlying these assignments,
we have developed the standalone software package described
here, ADAPT-NMR Enhancer.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

ADAPT-NMR Enhancer is an SDI (Single Document Interface)
application written in C++ with QT4 libraries (http://qt.nokia.
com) for graphical user interface. The software supports multiple
operating systems (MS Windows, MacOSX and Linux).
ADAPT -NMR Enhancer offers three active dialog boxes:
Main Window Dialog, PINE Assignment Dialog and Probable
Assignment Dialog. The Main Window Dialog (Fig. 1A) allows
the visualization of peaks picked in 2D tilted planes and their
positions in 3D space. 2D and 3D peak lists are located to the left
of the dialog box; file I/O (input/output), visual manipulation,
peak picking, linking and assignment tools are located at the top
of the dialog box. A maximum of six synchronized 2D tilted
planes can be viewed at once. The x-axis represents the 1H chem-
ical shift dimension, which is invariant with tilt angle. However,
the y-axis is a combination of 13C and 15N chemical shifts as
represented by the tilt angle. Thus, it is hard for users to judge
the correctness of 3D peaks constructed from peaks in tilted 2D
planes. ADAPT-NMR Enhancer offers two functions to resolve
this problem. When one chooses a constructed 3D peak from the
3D peak list at the left side of the dialog box, circles appear in the
displayed 2D tilted planes at positions where peaks are expected,
and a lime-colored dot identifies peaks associated with the 3D
reconstruction (Fig. 1A). Alternatively (not shown), the user can
right-click and drag a 2D peak to give it the lime dot and identify
the corresponding peak in the 3D peak list; again, regions in the
displayed 2D planes where peaks are expected are circled. Tools
located at the top of the Main Window Dialog can be used not
only to validate the automated peak picking and assignment but
also to add missing peaks, remove peaks picked in error or cor-
rect assignments. PINE-SPARKY (Lee et al., 2009) tools have
been incorporated into ADAPT-NMR Enhancer to assist with
resonance assignments. The PINE Assignment Dialog (Fig. 1B)
displays the peptide chain with atoms associated with assigned
chemical shifts with their probabilities indicated by color coding.
The candidate list box shows all 3D resonances for a given

experiment that PINE considered as possible assignments for the
selected atom. If the constructed 3D spectrum does not exhibit
the predicted peak, the user can examine the linked 2D tilted
planes for evidence of a peak. This examination is accomplished
by double-clicking the candidates, so as to view the correspond-
ing 3D peak. The Probable Assignment Dialog box pops up
when a 3D peak from the 3D list box or from the spectral
view is selected. It lists possible assignments for a peak along
with their probabilities. The PINE Assignment Dialog box is
based on atoms, whereas the Probable Assignment Dialog box
is based on peaks. The user can either conﬁrm or modify the
assignment for a 3D peak. The decision is stored in the conﬁrm-
ation list box, and the results can be exported in a variety of ﬁle
formats.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

AeSCP-2 (l 10 residues) is the Aedes aegypti sterol carrier protein
2, which is involved in cellular lipid transport mechanisms related
to lipid uptake and metabolism (Gallegos et al., 2001; Singarapu
et al., 2010). This protein was the one used to test ADAPT-NMR
(Bahrami et al., 2012). Although assignments were made to 510
atoms with >99% probability of correctness, the assignment
probabilities of 24 atoms was 399% and no assignment were
obtained for 5 atoms. We used ADAPT-NMR Enhancer to visu-
alize and improve the quality of the assignments. We manually
added peaks that had not been picked by the automated algo-
rithm; we deleted picked peaks clearly arising from noise; and we
modiﬁed the priority scores of the peaks on the basis of manual
assessment. With the new peak set as input, ADAPT-NMR
yielded improved scoring: of the 24 assignments initially scored
at <99% probability, only 7 remained <99% probability. We
then used the manual features of ADAPT-NMR-Enhancer to

determine why these seven assignments were of lower probabil-
ity. We found, for example, that because residue 80 is proline, the
CBCA(CO)NH dataset yielded no connectivities from P80 to the
CA and CB of L79. However, we could easily conﬁrm the as-
signment from HNCA(HNCB) data. Another atom with low-
assignment probability, A60CA, was found to have a low-peak
intensity that prevented its detection in the CBCA(CO)NH ex-
periment. The missing peak was easily added by using the editing
tool of ADAPT-NMR Enhancer, so that ADAPT-NMR recog-
nizes the peak when the program is re-run. All backbone reson-
ance assignments were conﬁrmed or completed by means of a
“sequential walk’ through the 3D HNCA(HNCB) and
CBCA(CO)NH data. The ‘Lock’ tool in ADAPT-NMR
Enhancer, which enables one to predict the position of a 3D
peak by selecting two peaks from 2D tilted planes, was found
to be useful in conﬁrming assignments. In cases where a large
number of noise peaks have been deleted, ADAPT-NMR will
suggest another experiment and tilt angle for data collection. The
detailed strategies used are documented at http://pine.nmrfam.

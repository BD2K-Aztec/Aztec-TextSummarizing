ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genetic studies focus on increasingly larger genomic
regions of both extant and ancient DNA, and there is a need
for simulation software to match these technological advances.
We present here a new coalescent-based simulation program
fastsimcoal, which is able to quickly simulate a variety of genetic
markers scattered over very long genomic regions with arbitrary
recombination patterns under complex evolutionary scenarios.
Availability and Implementation: fastsimcoal is a C++ program
compiled for Windows, MacOsX and Linux platforms. It is freely
available at cmpg.unibe.ch/software/fastsimcoall, together with its
detailed user manual and example input files.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coalescent theory has revolutionized the ﬁeld of population genetics
by providing a very powerful and intuitive framework for the study
of molecular diversity within and between species (Hudson, 1990).
It has also provided very efﬁcient ways to simulate diversity under
complex evolutionary scenarios (Wakeley, 2009).

A variety of coalescent-based simulation programs have been
developed in the past few years (e.g. Chen et al., 2009; Ewing
and Hermisson, 2010; Hudson, 2002; Laval and Excofﬁer, 2004),
allowing one to generate genetic data much more quickly than with
classical forward approaches [see e.g. Carvajal-Rodriguez (2008)
for a review of recent coalescent and forward genetic simulators].
However, many standard simulation programs now have problems
in generating polymorphisms over long genomic regions, like those
now produced by new generation sequencing technologies (e.g.
Durbin et al., 2010).

In this article, we present fastsimcoal, a completely rewritten
continuous-time implementation of simcoal2 (Laval and Excofﬁer,
2004), with a fast sequential Markovian coalescent (SMC)
model for recombining DNA sequences (Marjoram and Wall,
2006). fastsimcoal retains simcoal2 full ﬂexibility in setting up
complex demographic scenarios, arbitrary recombination distances
between markers, arbitrary migration rates between populations and
historical events. In addition, fastsimcoal allows users to specify the

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

2.1 Continuous-time coalescent

The slow generation-by-generation approach implemented in simcoal2 has
been replaced by a faster continuous-time coalescent framework similar to
that implemented in ms (Hudson, 2002). Despite this change, we have kept
the same parameterization of evolutionary scenarios as in simcoal2. Times
of demographic events are still deﬁned in generations, population sizes are
deﬁned in number of haploid individuals and mutation and recombination
rates are deﬁned per base pair per generation.

2.2 Sequential Markov coalescent

In recent years, some new approximations of the recombination process have
been developed (Chen et al., 2009; Maljoram and Wall, 2006; McVean and
Cardin, 2005) that allow one to simulate DNA sequences over hundreds of
megabytes much faster than under the traditional ancestral recombination
graph (ARG) model. The new SMC (McVean and Cardin, 2005) has been
shown to produce patterns of polymorphisms and linkage disequilibrium
extremely similar to those generated under a classical ARG model (Chen
et al., 2009; Eriksson et al., 2009; Maljoram and Wall, 2006), while
being much faster and demanding less memory resources. Under SMC, one
generates a tree on the left end of the sequence under study, and computes
the position of a recombination event on the right-hand side assuming an
exponential distribution of recombination positions along the sequence.
A recombination event is then implemented at random along the current
tree, and the detached recombining lineage is then free to coalesce with the
other remaining lineages, leading to a new tree with a potentially different
topology and most recent common ancestor (MRCA). This procedure is
continued until one reaches the end of the sequence to be generated. Some
variations of this SMC’ algorithm have been proposed to allow for coalescent
events to occur between the detached lineage and the exact same branch that
was cut by the recombination event [SMC’ algorithm, Marjoram and Wall
(2006)], or with trees that are further than one recombination away on the
left-hand side (Chen et al., 2009).

We have implemented here the SMC’ algorithm in a structured population
with demes connected by migrations. For each tree, we thus record all
migration events having occurred in addition to all coalescent events. These
events are then replayed to generate the next tree, such that the detached
recombinant lineage can migrate in any deme and potentially coalesce with
lineages from the left tree that were present there at the same time.

2.3 Arbitrary recombination rates between markers

As in simcoal2, we have retained the possibility to simulate genetic markers
at arbitrary recombination distances, such as to be able to model an array of
markers at ﬁxed locations on the genome or hot spots of recombination,

which is not directly possible with ms. We have thus implemented the
possibility to have multiple recombination events between adjacent markers
(Supplementary Fig. SI). This strategy results in patterns of linkage
disequilibrium between pairs of markers that are Virtually identical to those
obtained under an ARG model (see Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.4 Serial sampling

Ancient DNA is becoming increasingly easy to extract and analyze, and
when combined with present samples, it can shed new light on ancient
demographic processes [see e.g. Ramakrishnan et al. (2005)]. Moreover,
ignoring sampling heterochrony can lead to severe biases in demographic
inferences and statistical tests (Depaulis et al., 2009). It therefore appears
important to take into account uneven sampling time when using simulations
to generate expected diversity. Like serial simcoal (Anderson et al., 2005),
fastsimcoal now offers the possibility to deﬁne the age of each sample. Input
ﬁle compatibility is preserved with simcoal2, by assuming present sampling
when this age is omitted.

2.5 Sampling simulation parameters

Coalescent simulation programs are new central to several Approximate
Bayesian Computation [ABC,Beaumont et al. (2002)] procedures to estimate
demographic, mutation or recombination parameters from genetic data (e. g.
Cornuet et al., 2008; Lopes et al., 2009; Wegmann et al., 2010). In order to
facilitate this integration and efﬁciently perform simulations for a series of
different parameter values, fastsimcoal can directly draw parameters from
predeﬁned prior distributions, or it can read parameter values directly from
a deﬁnition ﬁle. These parameter values are then substituted to speciﬁc
keywords present in a template input ﬁle, in a way similar to what is
implemented in ABCToolBox (Wegmann et al., 2010). This integration is
useful here since a single continuous-time coalescent simulation can be
much faster than the calling of an external program that generates random
parameter values. fastsimcoal now outputs site frequency spectra from DNA
sequence data, which can be directly used as a summary statistic in ABC.

2.6 Input and output ﬁles

We have retained full compatibility with simcoal2 parameter ﬁles, and former
input ﬁles should run without modiﬁcations with fastsimcoal. Additional
options can now be explicitly given on the command line, according to the
linux command line style. For instance, typing ‘./fastsimcoal —i test.par —n
100’ will launch 100 simulations of the model deﬁned in input ﬁle test. par.
‘./fastsimcoal —h’ will list all possible command line options. Output ﬁles are
similar to those generated by simcoal2, except that only polymorphic sites
are now output for DNA sequences, with an indication of their position on
the chromosome.

2.7 Benchmarks

fastsimcoal has been extensively tested against ms (Hudson, 2002),
MaCS (Chen et al., 2009) and simcoal2, with and without recombination
(Supplementary Tables 82—84 and Figs S2 and S3). In summary, fastsimcoal
leads to patterns of diversity and linkage disequilibrium identical to those
produced by MaCS, while always being faster (up to nine times for small
sample sizes). Both MaCS and fastsimcoal give patterns of genetic diversity
very similar to ms, and are much faster with recombination. Additional
comparisons between the SMC and forward approaches can be found in
Chen et al. (2009). Other comparisons between forward simulations and
continuous-time coalescent approaches (e.g. ms) can be found in Davies
et al. (2007) or in Padhukasahasram et al. (2008).

3 DISCUSSION

While preserving all the simulation ﬂexibility of simcoal2,
fastsimcoal is based on a faster continuous-time SMC, similar to that

implemented in MaCS (Chen et al., 2009), while being always faster
than MaCS, especially in case of migration between populations and
for small sample sizes (n <100). In addition to MaCS, fastsimcoal
allows one to (i) generate genetic data other than just DNA sequences
[e. g. short tandem repeats (STRs), single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNPs)], (ii) simulate markers at arbitrary chromosome positions
(e.g. by using a recombination map), (iii) simulate samples at
different time periods (e.g. ancient DNA, or different Viral strains)
and it includes a parameter sampler allowing its integration into
Bayesian parameter estimation procedures. Note however, that the
use of the continuous-time coalescent approximation has been
criticized for simulating diversity over long chromosomal segments,
as it neglects the possibility of multiple and simultaneous coalescent
events, the probability of which increases with recombination rate
(Davies et al., 2007), and as it ignores overlapping recombinations
in case of selﬁng (Padhukasahasram et al., 2008). However, despite
these simplifying assumptions, patterns of diversities and linkage
disequilibrium generated by continuous-time coalescent simulators
are found very similar to those produced by forward and more
realistic simulators (e. g. Davies et al., 2007; Padhukasahasram et al.,
2008). For this reason, SMC-based simulators should thus be clearly
favored for generating long stretches of DNA when computing
time is an issue. Other ARG-based coalescent approaches like ms
(Hudson, 2002), or those allowing for multiple and simultaneous
coalescent events (e. g. Laval and Excofﬁer, 2004; Liang et al., 2007)
may be preferred otherwise.

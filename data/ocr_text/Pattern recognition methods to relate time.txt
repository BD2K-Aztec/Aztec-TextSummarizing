Abstract

Motivation: Comparing time courses of gene expression with time courses of phenotypic data may
provide new insights in cellular mechanisms. In this study, we compared the performance of five
pattern recognition methods with respect to their ability to relate genes and phenotypic data: one
classical method (k-means) and four methods especially developed for time series [Short Time-ser-
ies Expression Miner (STEM), Linear Mixed Model mixtures, Dynamic Time Warping for -Omics and
linear modeling with R/Bioconductor limma package]. The methods were evaluated using data
available from toxicological studies that had the aim to relate gene expression with phenotypic end-
points (i.e. to develop biomarkers for adverse outcomes). Additionally, technical aspects (influence
of noise, number of time points and number of replicates) were evaluated on simulated data.
Results: None of the methods outperforms the others in terms of biology. Linear modeling with
limma is mostly influenced by noise. STEM is mostly influenced by the number of biological repli-
cates in the dataset, whereas k—means and linear modeling with limma are mostly influenced by
the number of time points. In most cases, the results of the methods complement each other.
We therefore provide recommendations to integrate the five methods.

1 Introduction

Comparing time courses from different types of measurements is an
important topic in biological research (Cavill et al., 2013; Smith
et al., 2009; Tan et al., 2006), because it contributes toward under-
standing the response of complex cellular systems to perturbations.
In particular in toxicogenomics (which stands for the application of

-omics technologies to toxicology), comparing time courses of gene
expression with time courses of phenotypic endpoints (i.e. bio-
markers for the adverse outcomes induced by a chemical compound)
may help to distinguish gene expression changes related to toxicity
from changes not related to toxicity (Powell et al., 2006). The

present study focuses on comparing time courses of gene expression
with time courses of phenotypic data, also called phenotypic anchor-
ing of gene expression data. Phenotypic anchoring may provide add-
itional insight in the response to perturbations that cannot be
generated by analyzing gene expression alone. Various statistical
tools can be used for phenotypic anchoring (Ganter et al., 2008),
including pattern recognition.

Pattern recognition includes clustering (e.g. k-means), classi-
fication (e.g. support vector machines) and model reduction
(e.g. principal component analysis) (de Ridder et al., 2013).
Biological entities belonging to the same cluster are assumed to be
functionally related (Bar-Joseph, 2004; Liao, 2005).

In this study, five representative pattern recognition methods
were chosen. First, we included a clustering method that is able to
remove random patterns, called Short Time-series Expression Miner
(STEM). Removing random patterns is important for datasets with
a high number of variables compared with the number of time
points (Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006). Secondly, Dynamic Time
Warping for -Omics (DTW4omics), a method that takes into ac-
count time delays in biological processes (Cavill et al., 2013), is con-
sidered. In contrast to clustering methods (which treat all variables
in the dataset as equivalent entities), DTW4omics treats the pheno-
typic data as predefined profiles and searches for genes matching
these profiles using a distance metric. Thirdly, Linear Mixed Model
(LMM) mixtures, a clustering method correcting for variability be-
tween replicates (Celeux et al., 2005), is discussed. Furthermore, we
applied k-means, a classical clustering method for static data.
Finally, we used a regression method [linear modeling with the
R/Bioconductor package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015)], to find rela-
tionships between gene expression and phenotypic endpoints.

The five methods were compared with respect to their ability to
extract functionally related groups of genes, their sensitivity to
measurement noise, the inﬂuence of the number of time points and
the inﬂuence of the number of biological replicates. The technical
aspects (influence of noise, number of time points and number of
replicates) were evaluated on simulated data, mimicking real expres-
sion and phenotypic data. The biological outcome was evaluated ex-
ploiting two public datasets from toxicogenomics.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Pattern recognition methods

In this study, both simulated and real datasets were analyzed by
means of STEM, DTW40mics, LMM mixtures, k-means and linear
modeling with limma. Table 1 gives an overview of the properties
of the four methods. Calculations were performed in R (http://www.
r-project.org/), except for STEM, which is a Java application.

2.1.1 Short time-series expression miner
STEM (Ernst and Bar-Joseph, 2006) is a freely available Java tool
(http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~jernst/stem/) for clustering time profiles

that run in parallel. STEM distinguishes between real and random
patterns in time series by identifying time profiles that are signifi-
cantly present in the dataset. Significance is determined by permuta-
tion testing. Phenotypic endpoints were treated as genes and added
to the study. Opposite time profiles of phenotypic endpoints were
also added to the study in order to determine negative relationships
between genes and phenotypic endpoints. The variables in the
dataset (genes, phenotypic endpoints) are assigned to the significant
profiles based on similarity (positive correlation). Genes assigned to
the same profile as a phenotypic endpoint are assumed to be related
to that endpoint. The STEM clustering algorithm is described in
detail by Ernst and coworkers (Ernst et al., 2005 ). STEM has been
previously applied to cluster toxicogenomics time profiles (Alm
et al., 2009; Briede et al., 2010; Hebels et al., 2013). In this study
parameters for STEM were taken as described in previous work
(Briede et al., 2010).

2.1.2 Dynamic time warping for —omics

DTW40mics is publicly available in-house R code (http://web.tgx.
unimaas.nl/svn/public/dtwl) to detect similar patterns on different
time scales, due to delays or differences in speed (Cavill et al.,
2013). For each endpoint, a list of significant genes (false discovery
rate <0.05) is produced based on the calculation of the optimal dis-
tance between time profiles and permutation testing. All genes in
this list are supposed to be positively related to that endpoint. To de-
termine negative relationships, we repeat the previous steps for the
opposite time profiles of the phenotypic endpoints. DTW40mics
uses the distance function from the DTW package described by
Giorgino and coworkers (Giorgino, 2009).

2.1.3 LMM mixtures

LMM mixtures is a model-based method for clustering time series
that run in parallel, taking into account variability between repli-
cates (Celeux et al., 2002). Phenotypic endpoints were treated as
genes and added to the study. Opposite time profiles of phenotypic
endpoints were also added to the study in order to determine nega-
tive relationships between genes and phenotypic endpoints. LMM
mixtures divide the dataset in an optimal number of clusters. For
each cluster, the average profile for the cluster is described by a
LMM, with the times as fixed effects and variability between repli-
cates as random effect. Genes assigned to the same cluster as a
phenotypic endpoint (respectively, the opposite profile of a pheno-
typic endpoint) are assumed to be positively (respectively, nega-
tively) related to that endpoint. The optimal number of clusters is
determined using the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC) and
maximum-likelihood parameters are iteratively determined by an
optimization algorithm (Celeux et al., 2005 ). To determine a start-
ing value for the optimization algorithm for LMM mixtures, spec-
tral clustering (Ng et al., 2001) was applied. Using the cluster
solution from spectral clustering has previously been reported as an
efficient initialization strategy for LMM mixtures (Scharl et al.,
2010). Spectral clustering was performed in R using the ‘specc’ func-
tion of the ‘kernlab’ package (Zeileis et al., 2004). The mixture of
LMM was fitted with the ‘FLXMlem’ interface of the ‘flexmix’
package (Grun and Leisch, 2008; Leisch, 2004). Both R packages
are available on the CRAN website (http://cran.r-project.org).

2. 1 .4 k-Means clustering

Phenotypic endpoints were treated as genes and added to the study.
Opposite time profiles of phenotypic endpoints were also added to
the study in order to determine negative relationships between genes

and phenotypic endpoints. k-Means then clusters profiles with an it-
erative optimization algorithm that minimizes within-cluster vari-
ability, while maximizing between-cluster variability (Kintigh and
Ammerman, 1982; Liao, 2005 ). Each cluster is represented by its
cluster center. Genes assigned to the same cluster as a phenotypic
endpoint (respectively, the opposite profile of a phenotypic end-
point) are assumed to be positively (respectively, negatively) related
to that endpoint. The optimal number of clusters is selected based
on the sum of squared error (SSE), the sum of squared distances be-
tween cluster members and center (Kintigh and Ammerman, 1982).
The optimal solution was calculated in R using the code available at
http://www.mattpeeples.net/kmeans.html and is the number of clus-
ters for which the SSE for the original data differs the most from the
average SSE for 250 random datasets. k-Means was performed in R
using the source code available at http://www.mattpeeples.net/
kmeans.html, which uses the ‘kmeans’ function of the ‘stats’ pack-
age (http://cran.r-proj ect.org).

2.1.5 Linear modeling with limma

For each phenotypic endpoint, genes that vary with that endpoint
were determined by fitting a LMM to the gene expression data using
the R/Bioconductor package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015) (www.bio
conductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/limma.html). Time, treat-
ment (exposed versus control) and the phenotypic endpoint were
taken as fixed effect, and replicates as random effect in the model.
Using the phenotypic endpoint as a contrast (coefficient in the linear
model), limma tests which genes vary significantly with the pheno-
typic endpoint. A cut-off value of 0.05 was taken for the false dis-
covery rate. The regression coefficients for the endpoints determine
whether the relationships are positive or negative.

2.2 Simulated data

Performance of statistical methods can be evaluated by checking
whether the results correspond with prior biological knowledge.
However, often our knowledge about the underlying biology is in-
complete. In this case, computer simulations are very useful to assess
how well a method works (Mendes et al., 2003). Here, the inﬂuence
on the results of making changes, for example adding noise, to a ref-
erence dataset is studied.

2.2.1 Simulation method

We simulated datasets with properties of microarray data in
Matlab® Version 8.1.0. (r2013a) (copyright©, 1984—2013, The
Mathworks Inc.) applying the method described by Mendes and
coworkers (Mendes et al., 2003) and on the companion website of
Nykter et al. (2006) (http://www.cs.tut.fi/sgn/csb/mamodel/).
Thousand variables were generated for 10 time points. Each variable
in the dataset is described by a differential equation including rate
constants, affinity constants and Hill coefficients as parameters.
After simulating control samples, a perturbation was simulated by
changing one of the rate constants. Three biological replicates were
generated for both control and perturbation by adding small ran-
dom variables to the affinity constants and Hill coefficients. The ref-
erence dataset consisted of the log2-ratios for the three biological
replicates. Clusters of variables relating to variables 996—1000 were
determined applying the four pattern recognition methods, so vari-
ables 996—1000 are considered to be the endpoints. The inﬂuence of
measurement noise was studied by successively adding 15%, 20%
and 25% Gaussian noise to the reference data and comparing the so-
lutions for the pattern recognition methods with the solutions for
the reference dataset. Results of the reference dataset were also

compared with pattern recognition results when using less time
points (the first eight and six time points) and when using only two
biological replicates instead of three. Table 2 presents an overview
of the simulated data. More details about the simulation and the
Matlab code are provided in the Supplementary Data, Section 1.

2.2.2 Evaluation of pattern recognition methods

The results for the different simulated datasets were compared with
the results obtained from the reference dataset. The accuracy de-
scribes how close the results of the simulation were to the results for
the reference dataset.

2.3 Real datasets

The five pattern recognition methods were applied to two datasets
obtained from the human hepatoma cancer cell line HepG2: after
exposure to either benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), a human carcinogen, or
menadione (vitamin K3), an agent producing reactive oxygen species
(ROS). Both positive and negative associations with particular end-
points were determined.

2.3.1 Response of HepG2 to B(a)P

B(a)P is a carcinogenic polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon, having
genotoxic and non-genotoxic properties. B(a)P exposure causes,
among others, oxidative stress, DNA adduct formation and apop-
tosis (van Delft et al., 2010). Sources of exposure are (among others)
wood burning, coal tar, vehicle exhaust and cigarette smoke
(Bostrom et al., 2002). Gene expression and phenotypic endpoints
(DNA adducts, cell cycle, apoptosis indicative of molecular re-
sponses to DNA damage induced by the carcinogen) were measured
at 12 time points after exposure to B(a)P (3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 24, 30,
36, 48, 54 and 60 h). HepG2 cells were treated with 3 uM B(a)P or
vehicle control. Cell cycle profiles (G1, G2/M and S phase) and
apoptotic cell levels were determined by ﬂow cytometry. DNA ad-
duct levels were determined by 32P post-labeling. Gene expression
was determined with Agilent microarrays, labeled with cyanine 3
(Cy3) and cyanine 5 (Cy5). Two biological experiments were con-
ducted, with two hybridizations per time point for each experiment
(by swapping Cy3 and Cy5). Microarray data are available at
ArrayExpress (E-TOXM-22 and E-TOXM-23). Phenotypic data are
available in the Supplementary Data (Excel file). Detailed informa-
tion about this dataset was described earlier in van Delft et al.
(2010)

2.3.2 Response of HepG2 to menadione

Menadione (vitamin K3) is a compound causing oxidative stress
through the formation of ROS. Oxidative stress has been related to
chemically induced liver injury, chronic liver diseases and

hepatocellular carcinoma (Deferme et al., 2013). Menadione has
been used as a drug therapy and sometimes also as nutritional sup-
plement (Truong and Booth, 2011). Gene expression and pheno-
typic endpoints (oxidative DNA damage, protein oxidation, cell
cycle, apoptosis, which are all toxic responses inflicted by ROS)
were measured at seven time points after exposure to menadione
(0.5, 1, 2, 4, 6, 8 and 24 h). HepG2 cells were treated with 100 uM
menadione or vehicle control. Cell cycle profiles (G1, G2/M and S
phase) and apoptotic cell levels were determined by flow cytometry.
Protein oxidation was determined by protein carbonyl assay, meas-
uring protein carbonyl formation by spectrophotometry. Oxidative
DNA damage was determined using the FPG-comet assay. Gene ex-
pression was determined using Affymetrix microarrays. Three biolo-
gical experiments were conducted. Microarray data are available at
Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE39291). Phenotypic data are avail-
able in the Supplementary Data (Excel file). Detailed information
about this dataset was described earlier in Deferme et al. (2013).

2.3.3 Normalization, selecting differentially expressed

genes and scaling

Normalization was conducted as described earlier in van Delft et al.
(2010) and Deferme et al. (2013) for the B(a)P and menadione
dataset, respectively.

Differentially expressed genes (DEGs) were determined using the
R/Bioconductor package limma (Ritchie et al., 2015), controlling
for dye swaps in case of two-color arrays. ‘Treatment—time-
matched control’ contrasts were fitted at each time point and with
each treatment (exposure, control). Genes with false discovery rate
lower or equal than 0.01 and absolute log fold change higher than
1.5 were selected.

Log2 ratios were taken to transform the data to be normally dis-
tributed. Data were centered and unit variance scaled to make the
values of all variables (genes and endpoints) comparable.

2.3.4 Evaluation of pattern recognition methods

Overrepresentation analyses (pathway and GO analysis) were per-
formed on the lists of genes related to the endpoints using
ConsensusPathDB, an interaction database containing pathways
from 32 databases (Kamburov et al., 2013). Pathways and GO
terms with at least two genes in common with the gene lists were se-
lected. To correct for multiple testing, only pathways and GO terms
with false discovery rate lower or equal than 0.05 were selected.
Overlap between the genes, pathways or GO terms was determined
using the online tool Venn Diagrams (http://bioinformatics.psb.
ugent.be/webtools/Venn/). Lists of overrepresented pathways and
GO terms were compared with prior biological knowledge, among
others from the Comparative Toxicogenomics Database (Davis
et al., 2013).

3 Results

3.1 Simulated data

LMM mixtures divided the dataset into 19 clusters (based on the
BIC), while k-means only distinguished 5 clusters (based on the
SSE). Because of their different properties and underlying assump-
tions, there is minor overlap among all of the five methods (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S1). Which methods show the largest over-
lap is different for different variables (e.g. for variable 996
DTW4omics and k-means show the largest overlap, while for vari-
able 1000 STEM and DTW4omics show the largest overlap). The
overall biggest overlap is found between DTW4omics and k-means,

ods for the simulated datasets is shown in Table 3. Accuracies above
80% were found for all methods after noise had been added to the
data, except for limma, where accuracies for datasets with 25 %
noise were between 74% and 81%. Limma and k-means appeared
the most inﬂuenced by the number of time points. Lowering the
number of time points lowered the accuracy significantly. STEM
was most influenced by the number of biological replicates
available.

3.2 Real datasets

3.2.1 Response of HepG2 to B(a)P

Lists of genes, pathways and GO terms for each endpoint are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Excel file for each of the five methods.
Applying STEM, DTW4omics and limma resulted in a separate gene
list for each phenotypic endpoint. For LMM mixtures and k-means,
some of the clusters contained more than one phenotypic endpoint:

° DNA adducts and G1 were assigned to the same cluster by both
LMM mixtures and k-means;

° Apoptosis and S are assigned to the same cluster by LMM
mixtures;

° Apoptosis, G2 and S are assigned to the same cluster by k-means.

For DTW4omics and limma, some of the gene lists had genes in
common (see Supplementary Excel file, tab ‘B(a)P intersections gene
lists’). The other methods by definition divide a dataset into clusters
that do not have genes in common.

LMM mixtures divided the dataset into 11 clusters (based on the
BIC), while k-means only distinguished 7 clusters (based on the
SSE). Apart from a few exceptions, there was minor overlap across
the five methods when comparing lists of genes, pathways and GO
terms (Supplementary Data, Supplementary Figs. 52—S16). Figures 2
and 3 present a summary of the molecular response pathways
related to DNA adducts for the five methods. Detailed tables with
pathway lists for all endpoints, including references to prior biolo-
gical knowledge, are available in the Supplementary Data
(Supplementary Tables 52—511). The pathway ‘direct p53 effectors’

(Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3).

3.2.2 Response of HepG2 to menadione

Lists of genes, pathways and GO terms for each endpoint are pro-
vided in the Supplementary Excel file for each of the five methods.
Apart from a few exceptions, there was minor overlap among all of
the five methods when comparing lists of genes, pathways and GO
terms (see Supplementary Data, Supplementary Figs. S17—S34).
Applying DTW4omics and limma resulted in a separate gene list for
each phenotypic endpoint, except for the G1 and S phases wherefore
DTW4omics did not find genes that were positively and negatively
related, respectively. For STEM, LMM mixtures and k-means, some
of the clusters contained more than one phenotypic endpoint:

° apoptosis and protein oxidation were assigned to the same clus-
ter by both STEM and k-means;

° protein oxidation, G1 and S were assigned to the same cluster by
LMM mixtures;

° G1 and S were assigned to the same cluster by k-means.

For DTW4omics and limma, some of the gene lists had genes in
common (see Supplementary Excel file, tab ‘MEN intersections gene

lists’). The other methods by definition divide a dataset into clusters
that do not have genes in common.

LMM mixtures divided the dataset into 10 clusters (based on the
BIC), while k-means only distinguished four clusters (based on the
SSE). Figures 4 and 5 present a summary of the molecular response
pathways related to oxidative DNA damage for the five methods.
Detailed tables with pathway lists for all endpoints, including refer-
ences to prior biological knowledge, are available in the
Supplementary Data (Supplementary Tables 512—523). The pathway
‘direct p5 3 effectors’, an important pathway in signaling DNA dam-
age (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000), was found by LMM mixtures
(positive relationship, see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S12).
Furthermore, LMM mixtures found two DNA damage response
pathways (Fig. 2 and Supplementary Table S12).

3.3 Computational time

The computational time for running the analyses was about 105 for
STEM and limma, about 30—40 min for DTW4omics and about
30 min for k-means (including the algorithm for determining the num-
ber of clusters) on a 64 bit Windows 7 computer, 64 GB memory, intel
i5-3320 M processor. Running LMM mixtures takes 1 day for a given
number of clusters, so it would, e.g., take 24 days to generate the clus-
ter solutions with 2, 3,. . . , 25 clusters. Therefore, the calculations for
different numbers of clusters were run in parallel on a 64-bit
Windows 7 server, 64 GB memory, intel i7-3930 K(hexacore).

4 Discussion

Applying pattern recognition methods to toxicogenomics time series
of both microarrays and phenotypic endpoints can provide new
hypotheses about interactions of the genome with the adverse out-
come of exposure to a toxicant. These new hypotheses will guide
wet laboratory experiments (e.g. knock down experiments) that aim
to verify such new relationships.

In this study, we evaluated five pattern recognition methods. The
main focus is on methods developed for time series methods, except
k-means, which we added to the study in order to assess the impact
of time dependencies on pattern recognition. Another method for
static data, that has been frequently applied to time series, is
Weighted Correlation Network Analysis (WGCNA) (E10 and
Schwikowski, 2013), which combines correlation analysis with hier-
archical clustering (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008). Clusters ob-
tained by applying static-based methods on time series are often less
biologically coherent than clusters determined with time-series

methods (Bar-Joseph et al., 2012). However, this could not be
observed from this study.

STEM, LMM mixtures and k-means treat all the genes and end-
points as equivalent entities and cluster them all together. As a con-
sequence several endpoints may end up in the same cluster and some
clusters will have no endpoints. In our study, having several end-
points within the same cluster was found upon applying STEM,
LMM mixtures and k-means. Having two or more endpoints within
the same cluster has the advantage that similarity between the two
endpoints is explicitly known. A drawback of having two endpoints
in the same cluster is that one cannot really assess whether any par-
ticular gene in the cluster is more strongly associated with one end-
point than the other. Another drawback is that one can have only
certainty that the gene expressions really match the profile of the
endpoint if the endpoint is at the center of the cluster.

DTW4omics treats the endpoints as profiles and matches each of
the genes to these profiles. Limma uses the endpoints as fixed effects
in a regression model. As a consequence, for DTW4omics and
limma, each cluster has only one endpoint and a gene can match
more than one endpoint or none.

Clustering methods that do not correct for random patterns, like
LMM mixtures and k-means divide the datasets into large clusters.
This mostly leads to a large amount of pathways related to a large
number of biological processes. Correcting for random patterns
(like STEM) results in smaller gene lists, which has the advantage
that these lists are mostly easier to interpret. A disadvantage is that
if two variables are highly correlated to one of the model profiles by
coincidence, the two variables would also be in the same cluster,
which leads to false positives. Another drawback is that in cases
when the variable is not correlated to one of the model profiles, it is
not taken into account for further analysis. In this way information
may be lost. While STEM, LMM mixtures, k-means and limma find
gene expression modifications that covary simultaneously with the
investigated endpoints, DTW4omics allows time lags and delays.
Because of this property results from applying the DTW4omics ap-
proach are more influenced by the number of time points than the
two other time series methods (Table 3). Limma is more sensitive to
noise than the other methods (Table 3).

LMM mixtures and limma need biological replicates (for model-
ing the random effects), while STEM, DTW4omics and k-means in
principle can be applied without having replicates. However, this is
not recommended because it decreases the accuracy of STEM, and
to a lesser extent, of DTW4omics and limma (Table 3).

STEM and DTW4omics both use a permutation test for calculat-
ing significance. Permutation tests assume independence between
subsequent time points, which can be disadvantageous in case clear
trends are observed in the data (Xia et al., 2013).

LMM mixtures clustering and limma take into account variabil-
ity between replicates. The consequence of having a low number
(2—3) of replicates is that variability (the random effect in the model)
can be overestimated or underestimated. For LMM mixtures, under-
estimation (respectively, overestimation) of the variability between
replicates leads to clustering too strictly (respectively, not strict
enough), and as a consequence, may generate false negatives (re-
spectively, false positives). Another disadvantage of LMM mixtures,
and of model-based clustering in general, is that the algorithm is
slow compared with other methods. For limma, underestimation
(respectively, overestimation) of the variability between replicates
has inﬂuence on variance shrinkage and leads to decreased (respect-
ively, increased) sensitivity to detect relationships between genes
and phenotypic endpoints, which in its turn leads to false negatives
(respectively, false positives).

Pattern recognition methods

For all five methods studied, pathway and GO analysis of these
gene lists provided pathways and GO terms that have been previ-
ously related with exposure to the particular toxicant or with one of
its adverse outcomes (see Supplementary Material).

The hallmarks of cancer (Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000, 2011)
review biological processes related to all types of cancer, and the sig-
naling pathways involved in those biological processes. Those hall-
marks are: (1) sustaining proliferative signaling; (2) evading growth
suppressors; (3) avoiding immune destruction; (4) enabling replica-
tive immortality; (5) tumor-promoting inflammation; (6) activating
invasion and metastasis; (7) inducing angiogenesis; (8) genome in-
stability and mutation; (9) resisting cell death and (10) deregulating
cellular energetics. Because B(a)P is a carcinogen and menadione
causes hepatocellular carcinoma, pathways known to be involved in
the hallmarks of cancer provide biologically relevant hypotheses to
test in follow-up experiments. For B(a)P, in particular signaling
pathways related to DNA damage response are relevant (Bolotina
et al., 2007). Examples are signaling pathways involving p5 3, NF-
kB and MYC (Bolotina et al., 2007; Hanahan and Weinberg, 2000).
For menadione, pathways related to oxidative stress provide rele-
vant hypotheses. Signaling pathways influenced by oxidative stress
given in Martindale and Holbrook (2002) include pathways
involved in growth arrest, cell proliferation, senescence and apop-
tosis. All five methods provide biologically relevant pathways and
GO terms that are related to the exposure to the toxicant or its ad-
verse outcomes (e.g. cancer, oxidative stress) (see Figs. 2—5 and
Supplementary Material, Section 3). Therefore, in terms of retriev-
ing biologically relevant information, there is no method that out-
performs the others.

If we compare the results of limma, the only regression-based
model in the study, with the results for the other (correlation- and
distance-based) methods, we observe the following. LMM mixtures
positively relate the pathway ‘direct p5 3 effectors’ to DNA adducts,
while limma finds a negative relationship. Four genes of ‘direct p5 3
effectors’ are in both the genes lists resulting from LMM mixtures
and limma analysis (PCNA, TNFRSF10B, LIF and BAX), which
means that these four genes have a positive correlation with DNA
adducts, but a negative regression coefficient. This can be explained
as follows. The regression coefficient of the limma model gives the
relationship between gene expression and DNA adducts, when all
other variables in the model (treatment, time) are held constant.
This means that the positive relationship observed by determining
similarities between the time profiles was due to another (confound-
ing) variable. This shows an advantageous property of limma,
namely correcting for confounding factors.

For the menadione dataset (dataset Deferme et al., 2013), limma
cannot find any pathways related to oxidative DNA damage, while
all other methods generate a pathway list. For this dataset, applying
DTW4omics results in detecting some pathways that cannot be
found without time warping. One of these pathways is related to the
hallmarks of cancer (Fig. 4). This shows the relevance of having a
method taking into account time delays.

Applying the methods for phenotypic anchoring described in this
article results in poorly overlapping gene lists. This is a general prob-
lem of clustering algorithms. There are several reasons for the lack
of consistency between methods. First, parameters (optimal number
of clusters, thresholds) are determined by statistical means and not
on biological properties (Swift et al., 2004). Second, differences in
output are due to different intrinsic properties of these methods.
Limma is a regression method, while the other methods are based on
similarity measures (correlation, distance). Other differences in in-
trinsic properties (taking into account time dependencies, delays,

variance; correcting for random patterns) are shown in Table 1. For
static-based methods, several attempts have already been under-
taken to address these issues. WGCNA selects thresholds based on
scale-free topology, a network property previously observed in bio-
logical networks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005 ). Consensus clustering
attempts to combine the different approaches, capturing the advan-
tageous properties of each methods (Swift et al., 2004). However, to
our knowledge, similar attempts have not been undertaken for
methods developed for time series, taking into account time depend-
encies and delays.

In summary, we conclude that all five methods are suitable for
extracting new hypotheses concerning gene-phenotypic endpoint re-
lationships and none of the five methods outperforms the others in
terms of biology. Furthermore, all methods have their limitations.
Because these methods provide complementary results, we recom-
mend developing a method that integrates the results from the differ-
ent methods. A possible way to do this is to calculate a weighted
score for the probability of each gene—endpoint relationship based
on the accuracy of the methods. Simulation experiments can guide
the choice of the weight for each method. For example, because
STEM was highly inﬂuenced by the number of biological replicates,
we decrease the weight for STEM when having less replicates. In a
similar way, we can adapt the weight of k-means and limma accord-
ing to the number of time points. We can then multiply the false dis-
covery rate for each pathway with this probability score in order to
correct for inaccuracies due to the low number of replicates and/or
time points.

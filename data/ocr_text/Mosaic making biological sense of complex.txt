1 INTRODUCTION

The increasing throughput and quality of molecular measurements
in the domains of genomics, proteomics and metabolomics continue
to fuel the understanding of biological processes. Collected per
molecule, the scope of these data extends to physical, genetic and
biochemical interactions that in turn comprise extensive networks.
There are software tools available to visualize and analyze data—
derived biological networks (Smoot et al., 2011). One challenge
faced by these tools is how to make sense of such networks
often represented as massive ‘hairballs’. Many network analysis
algorithms ﬁlter or partition networks based on topological features,
optionally weighted by orthogonal node or edge data (Bader
and Hogue, 2003; Royer et al., 2008). Another approach is
to mathematically model networks and rely on their statistical
properties to make associations with other networks, phenotypes
and drug effects, sidestepping the issue of making sense of the
network itself altogether (Machado et al., 2011). Acknowledging
that there is still great value in engaging the minds of researchers
in exploratory data analysis at the level of networks (Kelder
et al., 2010), we have produced a Cytoscape plugin called Mosaic
to support interactive network annotation and visualization that
includes partitioning, layout and coloring based on biologically
relevant ontologies (Fig. 1). Mosaic shows slices of a given
network in the visual language of biological pathways, which are
familiar to any biologist and are ideal frameworks for integrating
knowledge.

Cytoscape is a free and open source network visualization
platform that actively supports independent plugin development
(Smoot et al., 2011). For annotation, Mosaic relies primarily on
the full gene ontology (GO) or simpliﬁed ‘slim’ versions (http:/l

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml). The cellular layout of
partitioned subnetworks strictly depends on the cellular component
branch of GO, but the other two functions, partitioning and coloring,
can be driven by any annotation associated with a major gene or
protein identiﬁer system.

2 METHODS

2.1 Annotation

Although Mosaic uses practically any annotation, its primary usage relies on
GO (for best results, a reduced subset of GO—slim). GO provides a controlled
vocabulary of terms describing key characteristics of gene products (i.e.,
process, location and function). Currently, Mosaic supports seven species
and we provide four different varieties of GO annotations for each species,
including three ‘slimmed’ ontologies.

The Mosaic package does not contain any data ﬁles. All necessary data for
each species are stored on the Mosaic web server where it will be periodically
updated. Users can download the corresponding data for their species of
interest prior to running Mosaic for the ﬁrst time. Once the data for one
species are successfully downloaded to the local machine, Mosaic can be
executed for this species in both ofﬂine and online modes. Each time a user
starts Mosaic with an Internet connection, Mosaic can synchronize local
data information with the server automatically. These data are parsed from
Ensembl and GO. Ensembl ID is recommended as the unifying identiﬁer for
user networks, although several other identiﬁer systems are also supported
in Mosaic.

2.2 Partition

The network is partitioned into a set of subnetworks based on the GO
Biological Process annotation of the nodes. For example, all nodes annotated
with the GO term ‘translation’ are placed in a new subnetwork entitled
‘Translation’. Subnetworks are hierarchically organized to reﬂect the parent—
child relationships between GO terms, and Mosaic only displays those
subnetworks with node counts between minimum and maximum thresholds
deﬁned in the settings panel. When a given node is annotated with more
than one Biological Process term, it is replicated and placed into each
corresponding subnetwork.

An overview network is also created, with each node representing a
Biological Process subnetwork. Node size reﬂects the number of genes in the
corresponding subnetwork and edge weight represents the number of edges
(connections) between the nodes in two subnetworks.

In the Mosaic Control Panel (Fig. 1), all subnetworks are listed
hierarchically, including subnetworks that fall outside deﬁned thresholds for
display. Selecting a subnetwork in the Control Panel will bring it into focus in
the tiled window view. Additional functions can be accessed by right—clicking
on the name of a particular subnetwork in the Control Panel. In particular,
‘partition this network to one further level’ allows users to partition a huge
network to deep levels of GO efﬁciently without generating hundreds of
other subnetworks from parallel branches.

proliferation’, a signiﬁcant term from an enrichment analysis in the study of atherosclerosis (King et al., 2005)

2.3 Compartmental layout

Mosaic performs cell—based layouts using a cell template that deﬁnes
graphical regions corresponding to cellular compartments and locations.
Nodes are positioned into regions based on their GO cellular component
annotation or in an ‘unassigned’ region (right margin) if no annotations
are present. Once nodes have been assigned to regions and positioned,
a force—directed layout is applied to nodes within each region. Nodes
annotated as being located in more than one cellular component are
replicated across regions. A sufﬁx is added to the node IDs for replicated
nodes, whereas the ‘canonical name’ is retained as the original node ID
and used as the node label. In addition, replicate nodes are given a red
border.

Because of node replication, relevant edges are also copied. To reduce
the complexity of the network, while retaining the original information,
edges can be pruned using a deletion strategy to remove certain edges. The
strategy is to keep those replicate edges that are completely contained within a
region and delete those replicate edges that extend between different regions.
The cellular layout algorithm stores region assignment and whether a node
exists in multiple regions as node attributes. Information on whether an edge
connects to a node annotated as ‘unassigned’ is stored as an edge attribute.

2.4 Visual style

The ﬁnal step in Mosaic is to apply color to nodes based on their GO
Molecular Function annotation. If a node has multiple Molecular Function
annotations, the most speciﬁc annotation will determine the node color. At
the top of the Mosaic Control Panel, sets of nodes can be selected to display
detailed information with the ‘Select nodes’ button. By clicking the ‘Legend’
button, the color legend of all Molecular Function terms can be toggled on
and off.

3 CONCLUSION

Mosaic provides researchers with an interactive tool to evaluate
biological interactions within the context of well-deﬁned processes,
functions and cellular localization while retaining all original
network information. Use of additional ontologies is anticipated to
provide further insights into the relevance of large-scale interaction
datasets and will be supported in future versions.

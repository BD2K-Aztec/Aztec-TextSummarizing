ABSTRACT

Motivation: Research in the biomedical domain can have a major
impact through open sharing of the data produced. For this reason,
it is important to be able to identify instances of data production and
deposition for potential re-use. Herein, we report on the automatic
identification of data deposition statements in research articles.
Results: We apply machine learning algorithms to sentences
extracted from full-text articles in PubMed Central in order to
automatically determine whether a given article contains a data
deposition statement, and retrieve the specific statements. With
an Support Vector Machine classifier using conditional random
field determined deposition features, articles containing deposition
statements are correctly identified with 81% F-measure. An error
analysis shows that almost half of the articles classified as containing
a deposition statement by our method but not by the gold standard
do indeed contain a deposition statement. In addition, our system
was used to process articles in PubMed Central, predicting that a
total of 52 932 articles report data deposition, many of which are
not currently included in the Secondary Source Identifier [si] field for
MEDLINE citations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Research in the biomedical domain aims at furthering our
knowledge of biological processes and improving human health.
Maj or contributions toward this goal can be achieved by sharing the
results of research efforts with the community, including datasets
produced in the course of the research work. While such sharing
behavior is encouraged by funding agencies and scientiﬁc journals,
recent work has shown that the ratio of data sharing is still modest
compared with actual data production. For instance, Ochsner et al.
(2008) found the deposition rate of microarray data to be <50%
for work published in 2007.

Piwowar and Chapman (2007) show that data deposition results in
increased citation of papers reporting on data production. While this

should serve as an incentive to deposit data and announce it to the
community, in a more recent study these same authors (Piwowar and
Chapman, 2010) show that data deposition is signiﬁcantly associated
with high—proﬁle journals and experienced researchers. In the course
of this work, these authors have found the identiﬁcation of data
deposition statements to be a challenging task that can be addressed
using natural language processing and machine learning methods
(Piwowar and Chapman, 2008a). Information about the declaration
of data deposition in research papers can be used in different
ways. First, for data curation: databases such as MEDLINE® use
accession numbers for certain databases as metadata that can be
searched with PubMed® queries using the [si] ﬁeld. Journals can
beneﬁt from such a tool to check whether their data deposition
policies are enforced. This aspect is also important for researchers
looking to re—use datasets and build on existing work. Second, for
the analysis of emerging research trends: the type of data produced
gives indications on current important research topics. In a study
based on the analysis of Medical Subject Headings® (MeSH®)
indexing, Moerchen et al. (2008) show that such metadata may be
used to predict future research trends, including recommendations
of main headings to be added to the MeSH thesaurus. Our long—
term research interest is in assessing the value of using deposition
statements for predicting future trends of data production. The initial
step of automatically identifying deposition statements could then
lead to an assessment of the need for storage space of incoming data
in public repositories. In this study, we aim at identifying articles
containing statements reporting the deposition of biological data.
As explained above, the study of data deposition has generated
a growing interest in the past few years. In response to a Nature
Methods editorial (Anonymous, 2008) describing the deposition of
data such as genome sequence or microarrays as ‘routine’, Ochsner
et al. (2008) used a manually built query to retrieve articles likely
to report the production of microarray data in 2007 publications.
They manually analyzed 398 articles reporting the production of
microarray data and concluded that only ~50% report deposition of
microarray data in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) or other
databases. Piwowar and Chapman (2008a) further studied the links
existing between microarray data deposition in public repositories
(e. g. GEO and ArrayExpress) and reports of data deposition in the
literature. They used machine learning to build a query suitable
for retrieving research articles in PubMed Central reporting on
data deposition. Piwowar and Chapman (2008b) also addressed the
classiﬁcation of articles (at the article level) for data sharing in
ﬁve databases (GenBank, Protein DataBank, GEO, ArrayExpress,
Stanford Microarray Database). The authors compared pattern
matching versus machine learning. The best results were obtained
with a J48 decision tree on ArrayExpress (96% F —measure),

Extraction of data deposition statements

 

although the corresponding dataset was rather small: 29 documents
including 12 positive results. Overall performance on the ﬁve
databases was 69% F —measure. Kim et al. (2010) compared
Support Vector Machine (SVM) and Bayes classiﬁers for the
identiﬁcation of sentences containing database accession numbers.
This task was tailored to the speciﬁc need for curation of accession
numbers in databases such as MEDLINE. These authors discussed
the errors linked to ambiguity of accession numbers with other
reference numbers such as PMIDs. However, they did not discuss
or investigate the occurrence of accession numbers for purposes
other than data deposition. For instance, accession numbers can be
given in sentences reporting the re—use of previously deposited data.
They can also be used in sentences discussing datasets that were
produced separately from the context of the experiments reported in
the article. Finally, in an effort to bridge the gap between speciﬁc
gene or genomic regions and related research articles, Haeussler
et al. (2011) show that the extraction of short DNA sequences
from full—text articles can be used to automatically map articles to
GenBank entries without relying on mentions of gene names or
accession numbers.

In our work, we propose to identify articles reporting data
deposition through the classiﬁcation of sentences. The general
topics of text classiﬁcation and speciﬁcally sentence classiﬁcation
have been well studied in the past decade (Sebastiani, 2002).
In the biomedical domain, many tasks can be approached as
a sentence classiﬁcation problem. Often, the small number of
classes studied makes the problem amenable to the use of machine
learning methods. For instance, several efforts aiming at the
retrieval of text passages as evidence for biological or clinical
phenomena performed sentence classiﬁcation. Demner—Fushman
et al. (2005) addressed the classiﬁcation of MEDLINE abstract
sentences between seven clinical outcome categories in order to
automatically identify outcome—related information in the medical
text. They reported the precision of the top ranked sentence
between 50% and 60% depending on category. Kim et al. (2011)
used the same dataset for classifying sentences for evidence—based
medicine. Their best performance for SVM classiﬁcation was 81%
F —measure obtained for the outcome category of sentences in
structured abstracts. Results for unstructured abstracts and other
categories were less successful. Polajnar et al. (2011) addressed
the identiﬁcation of MEDLINE abstract sentences denoting protein—
protein interaction as a binary classiﬁcation problem. Using SVM
classiﬁers and protein annotations as features, they reported best
F —measure performance of ~70%. While these efforts were limited
to abstracts, other work used full—text articles. In the BioCreative
II challenge (Krallinger et al., 2008), the interaction sentences
subtask required participants to retrieve passages of up to three
consecutive full—text sentences providing evidence for protein—
protein interaction. The best performing team obtained ~20%
precision when automatically extracted passages were compared
with evidence sentences manually selected by curators. These results
reﬂect the difﬁculty of the task of extracting evidence statements
from full—text articles.

2 MATERIAL AND METHODS

In this study, we are interested in identifying statements declaring the
deposition of biological data (such as microarray data, protein structure, gene
sequences) in public repositories. In the rest of this article, we will refer to

such statements as ‘deposition statements’. We take these statements as a
primary method of identifying articles reporting on research that produced
the kind of data deposited in public repositories. (1) and (2) show examples of
such statements, with varying degrees of speciﬁcity. In (1) both the data and
location are referred to in a highly speciﬁc manner [i.e. ‘the sequence of labA’
and ‘DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL databases (accession no AB281186)’], whereas
in (2) data and deposition location are both very general (‘the microarray
data’ and ‘MIAMExpress’). While the mention of data, public repositories
and accession numbers are strong indicators of deposition statements, (3) and
(4) show that these elements can also occur when authors refer to previous
work. In the remainder of this article, we will refer to statements that do not
report the deposition of data in public repositories—such as (3) and (4) as
‘non—deposition statements’.

(1) The sequence of labA has been deposited in the DDBJ/GenBank/
EMBL databases (accession no AB281186) (PMID 17210789).

(2) The microarray data were submitted to MIAMExpress at the EMBL—
EBI (PMID 18535205).

(3) Histone TAG Arrays are a repurposing of a microarray design
originally created to represent the TAG sequences in the Yeast
Knockout collection (Yuan et al., 2005; NCBI GEO Accession
Number GPL1444) (PMID 18805098).

(4) Therefore, the primary sequence of native Acinetobacter CMO is
identical to the gene sequence for chnB deposited under accession
number AB006902 (PMID 11352635).

Figure 1 gives an overview of the annotated datasets used in the training
and test phases of this work. The various datasets shown on Figure 1 are
provided as Supplementary Material and are also freely available to the
research community from the NLM/NCBI website. The following sections
describe details of the datasets and experiments. In Section 2.1, we describe
the method used to collect the training datasets, and the analysis of deposition
sentences that we carried out in order to gain an understanding of the variety
and common characteristics of these statements. In Sections 2.2 and 2.3,
we explain how the training datasets were used to automatically identify
deposition elements and perform sentence classiﬁcation. Finally, in Section
2.4 we present the test set and in Section 2.5 we describe the experiments
performed on the test set.

2.1 Training corpus collection and analysis

Corpus collection: to gain a better understanding of the variety of deposition
statements across data types, journals and databases, we compiled a corpus
of deposition statements based on previous work by Piwowar and Chapman
(2008a) and Ochsner et al. (2008) that we extended.

Speciﬁcally, 112 microarray deposition statements from 105 articles
were obtained using the existing corpora. After a manual review of these
statements, two strategies were devised to collect additional statements.
Our regular expression strategy consisted in two steps. First, the Ochsner
et al. query1 was used to retrieve 2008 articles in PubMed Central. Second,
articles were segmented into sentences and sentences likely to report data
deposition were retrieved if they met the three following criteria: (i) sentence
length was between 50 and 500 characters to avoid section titles and
sentence segmentation errors; (ii) sentence contained a mention of GEO

or ArrayExpress, which are the largest databases for microarray data (Stokes
et al., 2008) or a mention of a GEO or ArrayExpress accession number or the
pattern [micro]?array  datalexperiment/analyslanalyz; and (iii) sentence
contained one deposition action seed from the following: deposit, found,
submit, submission, available, access, uploaded, entered, posted, provided,
assigned, archived.

After manual review, 133 of the 243 candidate sentences were added to
the pool of deposition statements. The remaining 110 sentences [such as (3)
and (4)] were kept as examples of non—deposition statements, and used in

our machine learning strategy to retrieve deposition statements for data other
than microarray.

In the machine—learning strategy, we aimed at enriching our training
corpus, as proposed by Yeganova et al. (2011). A simple (i.e. only using
sentence tokens as features) Na'1've Bayes (NB) model was built using the
243 microarray data deposition statements as positive examples and ~33 000
sentences (the 110 above non—deposition statements, plus sentences from
MEDLINE abstracts that contained the word ‘deposit’ or ‘deposited’) used
as negative examples.

In spite of our blanket assumption that the sentences extracted from
MEDLINE abstracts were non—deposition statements, we did expect a small
number of them to be actual deposition statements. Our reasoning was that
the proportion of true non—deposition statements would be high enough to
train an efﬁcient model; while applying the model on the set of so—called
negatives, it would rank the deposition statements high enough to collect
them and adjust our training sets. By iterating on this method recursively,
we ﬁnally obtained a training set of 586 positive or deposition statements
(including the initial 243 microarray deposition statements) and 578 negative
or non—deposition statements that scored high with the model (including the
initial 110 non—deposition statements). This set was used as training data for
building NB and SVM data deposition models, and will be referred to as
Train—D (Fig. 1).

Analysis of deposition elements: to better characterize deposition
statements, sentences were tagged for components referring to data,
deposition action and deposition location using the following guidelines:

‘Data’: a phrase referring to biological data that can be found in public
repositories. Patient data and data relevant to ClinicalTrials. gov were
not considered. However, generic references to data were marked,
when used in the context of biological data. This included expressions
such as ‘the data’, ‘the protein’, ‘RNA’, ‘DNA’. In addition, speciﬁc
references to data such as ‘p53 conditional knockout mouse aCGH
data’ were also marked.

‘Action’: a phrase describing the action undertaken by authors regarding
depositing data. This includes phrases such as: deposit, submit,
upload/download, is available, can be found, etc.

‘General Location’: reference to the location of data deposition,
e.g. public repository name or website URL (e.g.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0v/genbank/). This also includes a
reference to an organization hosting a public repository in the context
of data deposition.

‘Detailed Location’: detailed reference to the location of data
deposition. This includes accession numbers and speciﬁc
URLs allowing direct access to the data deposited (e.g.
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0v/nuccore/GQ386843).

(1t—4t) show how the statements exempliﬁed in (1—4) were tagged.

(1t) <data>The sequence of labA</data>
<action>has been deposited </action>
<location="genera1”> in the DDBJ/GenBank/EMBL databases

aWhen accession numbers were uniﬁed, the variability lessened considerably with 71
unique occurrences only.

chnB</data>
<action>deposited</action> <location="detail">under accession
number AB006902</location>

Based on this tagging effort, Table 1 shows a summary of component
occurrences over the corpus of 586 deposition statements. Only 16% of
sentences contain information that is not included in one of the four tags
(7% for full—text sentences, 24% for abstract sentences).

‘Data’ is a category with high variability. While general references to data
such as ‘the data reported in this paper’ (25 occurrences), ‘the microarray
data’ (22 occurrences) and ‘the sequences’ (20 occurrences) are the most
frequent phrases used, they are not prevalent overall.

‘Action’ is the category with the least variability. It is expressed by verbs
in most cases. In other (rare) cases, nominalization expresses the action,
e.g. ‘the deposition/accession number is  In more than two—thirds of
cases, the action is expressed using a passive verb form, or a present verb
+ adjective, which is a similar construct. Future tense was used only once
in the corpus. (Note that the variability on ‘actions’ is slightly skewed due
to the selection of MEDLINE abstract sentences with the words ‘deposit’ or
‘deposition’—variability for actions is otherwise ~20%.)

‘General Location’ is also of high variability, in spite of the fact that
there are a limited number of locations referenced, such as GenBank
or GEO. Variation factors are as follows: (i) preposition introducing the
location at/from/in/into/through/to/on/via/with/within; (ii) URL used (e.g.
~5 variants for GEO); (iii) use of full name and/or abbreviation for
institutes (NCBI, EBI) and database (GEO); (iv) typos, spelling errors
and other variation (e.g. database versus data bank). ‘Detailed Location’
is a category with relatively low variability if we consider accession
numbers as one token type. Variation factors are as follows: (i) preposition
introducing the location through/under/with; (ii) reference to ‘accession
number’: code/number/no/(super)series; and (iii) list of numbers versus only
one number. In the case of a list, a speciﬁc data description may be embedded
within the list.

2.2 Automatic identiﬁcation of deposition components
in sentences

Based on the analysis above, the identiﬁcation of the four deposition
components deﬁned (data, deposition action, general location and speciﬁc
location) in deposition statements appeared to be important for extracting
speciﬁc deposition information. To provide a complete description of the
sentences, any part not covered by the four tags was considered as belonging
to a ﬁfth default tag, ‘nil’. In addition, we anticipated that these components
might be useful features for the classiﬁcation of deposition statements. For
this reason, in addition to the 586 data deposition statements tagged, another
697 non—deposition statements were also tagged manually. The negative
sentences tagged here are different from the 578 negative sentences used to
train the SVM classiﬁer in order to provide a good balance of sentences that
were partly or entirely covered with the ‘nil’ tag. These tagged sentences
were then used as a training set (that we will call Train—C) for training a
conditional random ﬁelds (CRFs) model using MALLET.2

2.3 Automatic identiﬁcation of deposition sentences

Using the ﬁnal sets of 586 positive and 578 negative sentences obtained
as described in the previous section (Train—D), we built several machine
learning models in order to assess the contribution of the following features
to the automatic identiﬁcation of data deposition statements:

Tokens from the sentences (also used in our simple model above)
Sentence relative position in article or abstract

Part—of—Speech (POS) tags obtained with MEDPOST (Smith et al.,
2004)

Component tags obtained with CRF model (trained using Train—C)

We compared NB and SVM models built using these features. Table 2
presents the performance (in terms of average precision) of each machine
learning method and feature set using 5—fold cross—validation.

2.4 Test corpus

We built a test corpus relying on MEDLINE curation of accession numbers.
Speciﬁcally, we used the following query to retrieve full—text articles indexed
with accession numbers and published in 2010 (we selected 2010 as a
publication date to avoid any overlap with our training data):

— (GenBank[si] OR GEO[si] OR PDB[si] OR OMIM[si] OR RefSeq[si]
OR PubChem—Substance[si] OR GDB[si]) AND pubmed pmc local[sb]
AND 2010[dp] (N=2,029)

These articles were considered as ‘positive’ for data deposition and were
therefore expected to contain a data deposition statement.

Based on the use of the MeSH term Molecular Sequence Data
for indexing articles containing references to various types of
biological data (as per Chapter 28 of the NLM indexer manual
http://www.nlm.nih.gov/mesh/indman/chapter_28.html), we used the
following query to retrieve full—text articles containing reference to
biological data but no deposition information referenced in MEDLINE:

— Molecular Sequence Data [mh] NOT (GenBank[si] OR GEO[si] OR
PDB [si] OR OMIM[si] OR RefSeq[si] OR PubChem—Substance[si] OR
GDB[si]) AND pubmed pmc local[sb] AND 2010 [dp] (N=4,708)

These articles were considered as ‘negative’ for data and were therefore not
expected to contain data deposition statements.

All articles (N 26737) were downloaded from PubMed Central in xml
format and converted to text format for processing. A subset of the corpus
comprising 700 articles (including 210 articles from the positive set and
490 articles from the negative set reﬂecting real—data balance) was selected
for testing. The MEDLINE [si] ﬁeld for the 210 articles selected contained

annotations for GenBank (110 articles), PDB (50 articles), GEO (47 articles),
RefSeq (4 articles) and GDB (1 article).3

Sentence-level gold standard: the 700 articles were segmented into
sentences that were scored both with the NB and SVM classiﬁers. In order
to avoid favoring one particular method, for each method, the top—scored
sentence was selected for each article, forming two sets of 700 sentences
that were manually annotated to determine whether they were data deposition
statements. The set composed of sentences that were top—ranked according
to the SVM model was called Test—SS. The set composed of sentences that
were top—ranked according to the NB model was called Test—SB. Out of the
two sets of 700 sentences, 423 sentences were selected by both methods,
so that the manual annotation was performed on one whole set of 700
sentences, and completed by annotating the remaining 277 sentences. The
three annotators involved in this task (the authors) were not shown the scores
assigned to the sentences by either classiﬁer, and they did not know whether
a given sentence came from an article in the positive or negative set. All
three annotators ﬁrst assessed a common set of 100 sentences (30 from the
positive article set and 70 from the negative article set to preserve balance)
in order to check the inter—annotator agreement and allow some discussion
of potentially ambiguous sentences. The remaining 600 sentences for this set
were divided evenly between the annotators in three subsets that preserved
the overall data balance. Finally, the 277 diverging sentences from the other
set were also processed by one annotator.

Article-level gold standard: the 210 articles with an accession number
reported in MEDLINE were considered as positive for data deposition
in our gold standard. In addition, based on the manual annotation of
sentences carried out for building the two sentence—level test sets, articles
corresponding to a sentence annotated as positive for data deposition were
also considered as positive in the article—level gold standard. This allowed
us to add to the gold standard 70 articles reporting the deposition of data
in repositories that are not currently covered by MEDLINE curation, such
as EMBL/EBI databases. The remaining 420 articles were considered as
negative for data deposition in our gold standard. The dataset comprising
gold standard judgments on these 700 articles is now referred to as Test—A.

2.5 Sentence and article classiﬁcation

Classiﬁcation was performed based on the scoring of article sentences. At
the sentence level, a classiﬁcation decision was made by comparison of the
score assigned to the sentence with a threshold, set at the 25th percentile
score for positive sentences in the training set: if the score was above
the threshold, the sentence was classiﬁed as positive for data deposition.
Otherwise, the sentence was classiﬁed as negative. At the article level, a
classiﬁcation decision was made based on the top—scored sentence. If the
top—scored sentence was classiﬁed as positive for data deposition, so was the
article.

The performance of sentence classiﬁcation was assessed using accuracy to
allow for indicative comparison with inter—annotator agreement. Speciﬁcally,
accuracy was computed as the number of sentences that were correctly
classiﬁed as positive or negative according to our gold standard over the
total number of sentences in the test set (N 2700). We also computed
precision, recall and F —measure to allow for a direct comparison with article
classiﬁcation. The performance of article classiﬁcation was assessed using
precision, recall and F —measure based on positive sentences only, to allow
for indicative comparison with related work. Speciﬁcally, precision was
computed as the number of articles that were positive in our gold standard
and also classiﬁed as positive by the algorithm over the total number of
articles classiﬁed as positive. Recall was computed as the number of articles
that were positive in our gold standard and also classiﬁed as positive by
the algorithm over the total number of positive articles in the gold standard.
F —measure was then computed as the harmonic mean of precision and recall.

 

3 One article could be annotated with accession numbers from more than
one database.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sentence-level classiﬁcation

Table 3 shows the performance of selected NB and SVM models for
sentence classiﬁcation on the two sentence test sets (the NB models
were applied to Test—SB while the SVM models were applied to
Test—SS). While differences between the models were very small for
cross—validation on the training set, some of them are emphasized
on the test set, in particular between the different feature sets. The
best overall performance obtained was 80% F —measure—which
corresponds to 87% accuracy. This accuracy compares favorably to
the inter—annotator agreement computed on a sub set of 100 sentences
that was found to be 95%. The classiﬁcation results from the best
model comprised 39 sentences misclassiﬁed as negative and 56
sentences misclassiﬁed as positive.

We performed an error analysis in order to assess the underlying
cause of these errors, and manually reviewed all misclassiﬁed
sentences. We found that error causes and distribution was similar
for NB and SVM. The breakdown of errors by cause (for SVM) is
shown in Table 4.

The major sources of error are top sentences that score low in
spite of being deposition sentences and sentences that report data
reuse and not data deposition. The error analysis also brought to
attention eight sentences (marked as ‘GS dispute’ in Table 4) that
proved difﬁcult to judge and/or were examples of genuine errors in
the gold standard. These problematic sentences seem to be within
the limits of 95% annotation consistency determined on the 100
sentences set.

3.2 Article-level classiﬁcation

Table 5 shows the performance of NB and SVM models for article
classiﬁcation on the test set (both models were applied to Test—A,
based on their respective results obtained from Test—SB for NB and
Test—SS for SVM). As could be expected, the best results are obtained
with the models including component tags as features, which also
perform best for sentence classiﬁcation.

The classiﬁcation results from the best NB model comprised 61
articles misclassiﬁed as negative and 44 articles misclassiﬁed as
positive. For this part of the study, we focused the error analysis on
positive articles that were classiﬁed as negative by our system, in
order to assess the underlying cause of the errors. Each case was
manually reviewed. The breakdown by cause is shown in Table 6.

The major cause for article misclassiﬁcation is a direct result of
a sentence classiﬁcation error: the relevant deposition sentence was
assigned a score below the threshold. Nonetheless, in these cases
relevant sentences appear in the top ﬁve scored sentences in 49 out
of 53 low scoring cases. Another interesting result from the error
analysis is the fact that six articles did not contain a deposition
sentence in the full text, and therefore could not be classiﬁed
properly by our system.

Figure 2 presents a more speciﬁc comparison between NB and
SVM models built using all feature types. This ﬁgure also allows
a comparison between sentence—level and article—level classiﬁers.
It can be seen that the overall performance on sentence—level
classiﬁcation and article—level classiﬁcation is similar.

Nonetheless, sentence—level performance is slightly lower than
article performance. This is explained by cases where the gold
standard judgments differ at the sentence and article level. In some
cases, the top—scored sentence that was assessed at the sentence level
is an ambiguous sentence that may have been classiﬁed as negative
for data deposition because of the lack of additional context. In some
cases, the top—scored sentence is truly negative for data deposition,
but the article contains another sentence that is positive for data
deposition.

3.3 Overall estimation of data deposition statement
prevalence in the biomedical literature

To estimate the prevalence of data deposition statements in the
biomedical literature, we processed all the PubMed Central articles
available to us in full—text XML as of 2 June 2011 (N = 827 762) and
used the NB model (with component tags as features) to classify
them according to data deposition status. In total, ~6.4% of articles
(N 252932) were found to contain a data deposition statement
according to our method. For the subset of articles that are part of
the MEDLINE database (N 2774 442), we also processed abstracts
with our method and found that <0.1% contained a data deposition
sentence. About 4.2% of the PubMed Central articles included in
MEDLINE (N: 32651) had a curated [si] ﬁeld. Most of these
PubMed Central articles were also classiﬁed as positive for data
deposition by our method (N :22 428). This is consistent with the
results of our evaluation.

4 DISCUSSION

Choice of features: interestingly, the difference in performance with
and without component tags observed in the cross—validation was
greatly magniﬁed on the test sets both for sentence—level and article—
level classiﬁcation. We think this is due to the more challenging
nature of the test data. In previous work (e.g. Kim et al., 2011)
on MEDLINE abstract sentence classiﬁcation, structure information
has proved to be a useful feature when it is available. Our
position feature was intended to serve as a substitute for structure
information, but had little impact. Structure information could
be considered for future improvement of the sentence classiﬁer;
however, this information is not trivial to extract from abstracts
(McKnight and Srinivasan, 2003; Ripple et al., 2011); similar issues
with added complexity can be anticipated for full text.

Portability 0f the method: although trained mainly on microarray
data deposition statements, the method adapts well to the
identiﬁcation of statements reporting on the deposition of other data
such as gene sequences or protein coordinates. This is evidenced

by the database breakdown of articles in our test corpus according
to the MEDLINE [si] ﬁeld: 110 articles reported data deposition in
GenBank, 50 in PDB and only 47 in GEO.

Comparison to other work: while similar to other work mentioned
in the related work section, our approach is not directly comparable
to any of the previous studies on data deposition. At the article
level, we perform an automatic classiﬁcation of articles containing
data deposition statements, in contrast with Ochsner et al. who
performed a one—time manual classiﬁcation in order to assess
the rate of data deposition in 2008. Piwowar et al. assessed
machine learning and rule—based algorithms for article classiﬁcation.
However, their approach focused on ﬁve databases and relied on
the identiﬁcation of predetermined database names in the full text
of articles. In contrast, our approach is generic and aiming at the
automatic identiﬁcation of any biological data deposition in any
public repository. Nonetheless, as an indicative comparison, it can
be noted that our overall performance for article—level classiﬁcation
is 81% F —measure, compared with overall 69% for Piwowar et al.
(on a different evaluation corpus).

Furthermore, in addition to article classiﬁcation, our approach
also retrieves speciﬁc data deposition elements allowing for a ﬁner—
grained characterization of both data and deposition location. At
the statement level, this is also different from the classiﬁcation
of databank accession number sentences performed by Kim et al.
(2010) in two ways: ﬁrst, we are only interested in retrieving
sentences containing accession numbers if these sentences are
deposition statements (versus comment on the data, or data re—
use) and second, we are also interested in retrieving data deposition
statements that do not contain accession numbers.

Interest of this study: one general interest of this study is our
application of the method proposed by Yeganova et al. in order to
build a training corpus when large amounts of unlabeled data are
available. We showed that the method of Yeganova et al. could
be easily and successfully adapted to our speciﬁc classiﬁcation
scenario. More speciﬁc to data deposition statement classiﬁcation,
the method presented in this article can be used as a curation aid
in MEDLINE or other databases indexing articles with accession
numbers; this tool can also be used to help updating current
databases. For instance, as announced in York (2006) GEO accession
numbers have only been indexed in the [si] ﬁeld of MEDLINE
citations from March 2006 onward. The application of our tool to
articles published prior to 2006 could help complete MEDLINE
citations with relevant GEO accession numbers. In future work, we
are planning to conduct such large—scale studies in order to identify
the growth of data production and data deposition in recent years.

Limitations of the study: our study addressed the identiﬁcation of
data deposition statements in full—text articles. While the availability
of full—text is deﬁnitely a limitation, our overall study of the
prevalence of data deposition statements (Section 3.3) indicates that
data deposition statements are signiﬁcantly more often found in the
full—text of articles, compared with abstract text. While our method
is not limited to data deposition in databases speciﬁcally curated
in MEDLINE, it is focused on the deposition of biological data as
opposed to clinical data as might be recorded in ClinicalTrials. gov,
one of the [si] curated databases. Finally, our classiﬁcation results
are obtained based on a threshold of sentence score, which was
empirically established at the 25th percentile of model scores on the
training data. Other methods of determining the threshold could be
investigated in future wok.

5 CONCLUSION

We presented a method to automatically identify biological data
deposition statements in biomedical text. The method, an SVM
(or, equivalently, NB) classiﬁer using CRF—determined features
characterizing data deposition components, was able to correctly
identify articles containing data deposition statements with 81% F —
measure. Our analysis shows that deposition statements are scored
high for all types of databases and biological data types, even those
not currently curated in MEDLINE. This shows the potential impact
of our method for literature curation. In addition, we believe it
provides a robust tool for future work assessing the need for storage
space of incoming data in public repositories.

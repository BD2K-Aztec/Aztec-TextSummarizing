ABSTRACT

Summary: The understanding of the biological role of RNA molecules
has changed. Although it is widely accepted that RNAs play important
regulatory roles without necessarily coding for proteins, the functions
of many of these non-coding RNAs are unknown. Thus, determining or
modeling the 3D structure of RNA molecules as well as assessing their
accuracy and stability has become of great importance for character-
izing their functional activity. Here, we introduce a new web applica-
tion, WebRASP, that uses knowledge-based potentials for scoring
RNA structures based on distance-dependent painNise atomic inter-
actions. This web server allows the users to upload a structure in PDB
format, select several options to visualize the structure and calculate
the energy profile. The server contains online help, tutorials and links
to other related resources. We believe this server will be a useful tool
for predicting and assessing the quality of RNA 3D structures.
Availability and implementation: The web server is available at
http://melolab.org/webrasp. It has been tested on the most popular
web browsers and requires Java plugin for Jmol visualization.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the recent years, there has been a shift in the way RNA mol-
ecule is conceived. It is now known that thousands of RNA
species are transcribed in a genome serving as regulatory elem-
ents without coding for proteins. There are numerous such non-
coding RNAs in the cell, many with unknown functions (Aalto
and Pasquinelli, 2012; Guil and Esteller, 2012; Lee, 2012).
Experimental determination of RNA 3D structures has hence
become an essential tool for characterizing their functional
activity. As a consequence, the number of RNA molecules de-
posited in the structural databases is increasing steeply (Capriotti
and Marti-Renom, 2008). However, there is still a large gap be-
tween the number of structures solved at the atomic level and the
available RNA sequences (Capriotti and Marti-Renom, 2008).
To help reducing this gap, several approaches and tools for pre-
dicting RNA 3D structures have been recently developed (Das
and Baker, 2007; Flores and Altman, 2010; Frellsen et al., 2009;
Jonikas et al., 2009; Parisien and Major, 2008; Popenda et al.,

2012; Rother et al., 2011; Sharma et al., 2008). These develop-
ments necessitate RNA structure accuracy assessment methods
and tools (Bernauer et al., 2011; Capriotti et al., 2011; Jonikas
et al., 2009). In this work, we introduce the web server WebRASP
to assess RNA 3D structures. The assessment relies on a know-
ledge-based potential for scoring RNA structures based on dis-
tance-dependent pairwise atomic interactions (Capriotti et al.,
2011). We believe our tool efﬁciently distinguishes between accur-
ate and inaccurate RNA 3D structures (Capriotti et al., 2011).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The core of the server relies on the Ribonucleic Acids Statistical
Potential (RASP), recently developed and validated by compari-
son with experimental data (Capriotti et al., 2011). RASP is a
knowledge-based potential for scoring RNA structures based on
distance-dependent pairwise atomic interactions. A standalone
version of RASP, implemented in the C—I——I— programming lan-
guage, can be downloaded from the web server.

There are four different RASP potentials: coarse-grain, back-
bone, backbone-ribose and full-atom. The coarse-grain potential
takes into account only the interactions between C3’ carbons (i.e.
four atom types, one for each nucleotide). Backbone potential
describes the energy scores considering the interactions between
atoms 03’, C3’, C4’, C5’, 05’, P, OPl, 0P2 and 0P3 (36 atom
types, 9 for each nucleotide). Backbone and ribose potential de-
scribe the energy score based on the interaction between atoms of
the backbone (as described above) and the rest of the ribose
atoms, namely, Cl’, C2’ and 04’ (48 atom types, 12 for each
nucleotide). Finally, full atom potential contains a deﬁnition of
energy score for pairwise interactions of all non-hydrogen atoms
in the four canonical nucleotides.

The energy score and proﬁle of RNA molecules are computed
in two sequential steps. First, a PDB ﬁle containing the atomic
coordinates of the RNA structure is uploaded. Then, some gen-
eral informative data about the uploaded structure is displayed,
such as the name of the ﬁle, its size and the number of residues it
contains. At this point, users can select the speciﬁc chain of the
structure to be proﬁled, the potential to be used and the window
size to average the energy scores. Additionally, in those RNA
structure chains that contain non-canonical nucleotides, an
option for including those non-standard nucleotides in the
total energy score and energy proﬁle calculation is available

Fig. 1. Screen snapshot of the assessment result for an RNA 3D structure

(this feature is only available on the web server, not in the stan-
dalone version). The atom type deﬁnition in this case is adopted
based on the closest standard nucleotide. It is important to note
that energy calculations for non-standard or modiﬁed residues
are only approximate and could miss some undeﬁned atom types
(Fig. 1, left).

The results can be viewed graphically with the option of inter-
active modiﬁcation. The information displayed is as follows:
total energy score, number of contacts (the total number of pair-
wise atomic contacts occurring in the structure and used to cal-
culate the total energy score) and normalized energy (the energy
score value per atomic contact). Users can download associated
data, namely, Proﬁle, which is a text ﬁle containing the values of
the energy score per residue; and, according to the options se-
lected, Modified residues, which is a text ﬁle containing the non-
canonical residues found in the structure. On the other hand, the
Visualization controls provide the color scheme for controlling
the visualization of the structure displayed in the Jmol applet.
There are three columns: value, custom and color. Column Value
lists the calculated maximum and minimum score values of the
energy proﬁle; the Mid value is the average between both values.
Column Custom allows the users to modify the color scale by
assigning different values to the maximum and minimum scores.
Please note that the ‘Mid’ value cannot be customized because it
is automatically adjusted. Column Color allows the users to
select the colors for the gradient. The default color gradient
goes from red (high-energy or unstable residues) to blue

(low-energy or stable residues), going through white (residues
of intermediate stability or accuracy). The option Show residue
labels shows the name of the residues in the structure as text
labels (users can also select the color for the labels). For any
change of the visualization controls to take effect in the Jmol
applet display window, users must use the UPDATE button
(Fig. 1, right).

At the bottom, the Energy/score profile is displayed.
According to the chain ID selected, this is the energy score pro-
ﬁle per residue in that chain. The ordinate represents the energy
score, whereas the x-axis represents the residue number. Rolling
the mouse over the energy proﬁle highlights the corresponding
residue on the Jmol structure visualization applet. Users can also
select the color shown for this highlight. The proﬁle can be
dragged off and horizontally scrolled to facilitate the interaction
and visualization of the structure and the energy proﬁle for long
RNA molecules (Fig. 1, bottom). The server contains help links,
a tutorial and a couple of pre—loaded examples.

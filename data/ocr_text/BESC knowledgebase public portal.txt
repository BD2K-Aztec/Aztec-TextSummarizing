ABSTRACT

The BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) is undertaking large
experimental campaigns to understand the biosynthesis and
biodegradation of biomass and to develop biofuel solutions. BESC
is generating large volumes of diverse data, including genome
sequences, omics data and assay results. The purpose of the
BESC Knowledgebase is to serve as a centralized repository
for experimentally generated data and to provide an integrated,
interactive and user-friendly analysis framework. The Portal makes
available tools for visualization, integration and analysis of data either
produced by BESC or obtained from external resources.

1 INTRODUCTION

The United States Department of Energy (DOE) initiative to increase
the production of renewable biofuels such as cellulosic ethanol
has led researchers to explore various biomass feedstocks and
microbes for alternative fuel solutions (Farrell, 2006; Gnansounou
and Dauriat, 2010; Rubin, 2008; Stephanopoulos, 2007; Zacchi
et al. , 2006). The BioEnergy Science Center (BESC) was established
by DOE in 2007 as a multi-institutional partnership driving scientiﬁc
efforts in this direction. BESC is undertaking large experimental
campaigns to understand and mitigate the recalcitrance of biomass
for cellulolytic degradation by enzymes and organisms, and to
develop multitalented microbes for converting plant biomass into
biofuels in a single step (Lynd et al., 2005). Researchers at BESC
are focused on comprehensive and system level understanding of
the process of biomass and plant cell wall formation, degradation
and biofuel production. As such, the center is generating large
volumes of diverse data including genome sequences, many types of

omics data and various assay results related to biomass properties,
structure and composition. Besides managing data generated by
BESC researchers, integration of key reference data such as
genome, gene annotations and metabolic annotation for bioenergy
relevant organisms is a central component, which provides a context
for understanding experiments. In this article, we describe some
important computational tools and data available from the BESC
Knowledgebase.

2 BESC KNOWLEDGEBASE DATA AND TOOLS

Reference genomic data: the microbial domain of the knowledgebase
currently contains 37 microbial genomes. Currently, the KB’s
reference microbial data consists of over 134 000 protein
coding genes. We continually add new organisms of interest,
genome annotations for organisms including BLAST hits, domain
annotations, protein localization, transcription unit data, enzyme and
pathway annotations. The microbial index page provides a set of
search interfaces to query the annotations and to download search
results. Reference genomic data are also available for each gene
through a uniﬁed interface, a gene card.

The plant domain consists of 21 plant and algal genomes along
with a rich set of their annotations including gene structures, protein
products, homology-based functional prediction, domain structures,
ortholog and paralog prediction, gene ontology, and metabolic
and enzymatic pathways. Currently, the KB’s reference plant data
consists of over 500 000 coding genes from which nearly 400 000
protein coding genes with function prediction have been identiﬁed.
The database keeps track of available gene model variations and
alternative splicing variants.

Phenotype comparison toolkit (CBP): this toolkit provides tools
to compare microbes across different phenotypes or genetic traits at
various levels of organization, such as whole genome, a biological
process, enzyme family, domain or sequence level. Comparisons
can be made between microbes with different phenotypes such as
aerobes and anaerobes, thermophiles and mesophiles. For each of
the phenotypes, users can select a group of organisms and compare
the groups in terms of their metabolic pathways, enzyme proﬁles,
protein family domains and orthologs.

BeoCyc: we have a collection of Pathway/Genome DataBases
(PGDBs) for BioEnergy relevant organisms, which we call
‘BeoCyc’. We have reconstructed metabolic pathways using the
Pathway Tools software (Karp et al., 2010). Although the PGDB

is generated automatically by the Pathologic program from the
Pathway Tools software, annotation of the genome with EC numbers
was improved before the reconstruction by using enzyme prediction
tools, like KAAS (Moriya et al., 2007), and by searching for
orthologous genes in model organisms.

Pathway Tools software provides a diverse set of options to
query, Visualize information in the databases, overlay experimental
data on metabolic maps and pathways and perform comparative
analysis.

Gbrowse: we have also conﬁgured Gbrowse—a popular genome
browser (Stein et al. , 2002) for all complete microbial genomes in the
BESC knowledgebase. Besides genes, we have operon predictions
from BeoCyc/Pathway Tools software (Karp et al., 2010) and a
database for prokaryotic operons (Mao et al., 2009) available from
the browser. SNP/indels from resequencing of an ethanol tolerant
Clostridium thermocellum strain (Brown et al., 2011) is also made
available from the genome browser. Users can also upload their
own data, such as SNPs/indels from some new strain, and compare
it with data from BESC by drawing tracks parallel to default tracks
available from the browser.

Integration and analysis of omics data from BESC, GEO and
ArrayExpress: the BESC Knowledgebase provides tools that allow
the user to search for experiments in external resources such as
NCBI GEO (Boyle, 2005) using keywords, bring them into the local
analysis environment and integrate datasets with genomic data in
the BESC Knowledgebase. Additional tools have been developed
in the framework for statistical analysis, such as generating
interactive scatterplots, heatmaps and mapping experimental data
onto pathways.

Cazymes Analysis Toolkit: the BESC Knowledgebase also hosts
the Cazymes Analysis Toolkit—CAT (Park et al., 2010), developed
and published earlier. This toolkit provides methods to search and
annotate CAZymes. This tool has already been used outside BESC
to annotate genomes (Kikuchi et al., 2011).

BESC KB Genome Resequencing toolkit: the target for
resequencing is usually the genome of a mutant strain with a
practically important phenotype evolved by an adaptation of a
wild-type strain. The toolkit provides a way to identify genomic
modiﬁcations underlying the speciﬁc phenotype of the mutant and
to understand potential biological effects of the mutation.

The tool kit consists of the following tools that can be applied
either as a pipeline or independently. ‘SNP—indel caller’ ﬁnds
changes in the genome of the mutant strain and their location given
a ﬁle with high conﬁdence 454 reads as the input. ‘Mutant protein
fasta’ generates a FASTA ﬁle of proteins for the mutant strain.
‘Mutant protein CDD’ annotates the proteins with protein family
domains using the CDD pipeline for the mutant strain. ‘Mutation
Mapper’ annotates all identiﬁed changes in the genomic sequence
of the mutant strain, its position in the genome, location of the
change within an intergenic region or gene, the type of change
(synonymous or non-synonymous, multiple changes, insertions
or deletions), and amino acids and codons in the M and WT
strains. ‘Regulation change predictor’ produces the list of genes
with mutational changes, either SNPs or indels, in the upstream
intergenic regions. Entire sequence span between coding sequences
of two adjacent genes are used without predicting transcription
factor binding sites. ‘Function change predictor’ predicts potential

changes in the protein function, like its gain or loss. Detail
documentation of the toolkit is available from BESCKB website
(http://cricket.ornl.gov/html/download/resequencing/Resequencing-
ToolkitDocumentation_16Dec2011.pdf). The tools were applied
to analyze the resequencing data for the ethanol adapted strain of
C.thermocellum ATCC 27405 (Brown et al., 2011).

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have made available suite of tools and diverse types of
bioenergy relevant data through the BESC public portal. The tools
may be especially helpful in integrating variety of data such as
genomic, phenotypic, metabolic and experimental data, and gaining
comprehensive, system level understanding of cellular processes
involved in plant biomass formation, degradation and biofuel
production.

Abstract

Motivation: Water molecules are key players for protein folding and function. On the protein sur—
face, water is not placed randomly, but display instead a particular structure evidenced by the pres—
ence of specific water sites (WS). These WS can be derived and characterized using explicit water
Molecular Dynamics simulations, providing useful information for ligand binding prediction and
design. Here we present WATCLUST, a WS determination and analysis tool running on the VMD
platform. The tool also allows direct transfer of the WS information to Autodock program to

perform biased docking.

1 Introduction

Water molecules play an essential role in the structure/function of
proteins, participating in enzymatic reaction mechanisms, ligand
binding and release and proton/electron transfer processes, among
others. Importantly, due to the shape and electrostatic potential of
the protein surface, water molecules are not placed randomly and
display instead a particular structure that can be characterized by
the presence of hydration or water sites (W5). These sites are defined
as confined space regions, adjacent to the protein surface, where the
probability of finding a water molecule is higher than in the bulk
solvent. They can be determined from explicit water Molecular
Dynamics (MD) simulations (Abel et 61]., 2008; De Beer et 61]., 2010;
Di Lella et 61]., 2007). Moreover, using the theoretical basis of the
Inhomogeneous Fluid Solvation Theory (Li and Lazaridis, 2012),
WS can also be structurally and thermodynamically characterized.
Once identified, they constitute a precious knowledge that can be
used in several applications, such as analysis of protein—ligand and

protein—protein complexes (Abel et 61]., 2008; Di Lella et 61]., 2007;
Forli and Olson, 2012), determination of hydration free energies of
simple solutes (Huggins and Payne, 2013), small ligands uptake by
heme proteins (Bustamante et 61]., 2014) and, as shown by us and
others, significant improvement of molecular docking results, both
in terms of accuracy and selectivity (Gauto et 61]., 2013). To date,
there are few methods for WS detection and characterization.
WaterMap (Abel et 61]., 2008) is a grid based method part of the
Schrodinger package which is not freely available. WATsite (Hu and
Lill, 2014) is restricted to perform MD simulations only with
GROMACS. Finally, there are other programs that do not require
MD simulations (Guarnieri and Mezei, 1996; Sanschagrin and
Kuhn, 1998) or use alternative thermodynamic calculation methods
(Li and Lazaridis, 2012; Nguyen et 61]., 2014). It should be noted
that none of them allow to use the WS information directly in dock-
ing calculations. Extended application of MD simulations to under—
stand protein function boosted the use of the open source graphical

and analysis interface known as Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD,
Humphrey et al., 1996) with more than 11 000 cites to date.
However, VMD lacks a WS determination/analysis tool.
WATCLUST fills this gap presenting an intuitive and user friendly
tool to determine WS and their properties, available to all people in
the structural bioinformatics field. Moreover, WATCLUST allows
direct transfer of WS information to Autodock (Morris et al., 2009),
one of the most widely used open source docking programs, in order
to perform WS biased docking (WSBD) (Gauto et al., 2013).

2 Methods

The method requires as input a set of snapshots derived from an ex—
plicit water MD trajectory. The strategy used to determine the WS is
adapted from our previous works (Di Lella et al., 2007; Gauto et al.,
2009). For each obtained WS the program computes the following
parameters: (i) water finding probability (WFP), (ii) R90, (iii) WS-
protein mean interaction energy (< Ewp >), (iv) WS—water mean
interaction energy (< Eww >), (v) mean total interaction energy with
respect to bulk (AE,,,,) and finally, (vi) excess rotational (Sr) and
translational (St) entropies. The resulting WS (or a selection of
them) can then be used to define an Autodock grid map to perform
a WSBD. See SI for details on WS determination, properties and
WSBD. The usage and output will be only briefly described here.
For further details and information on how to install the app see the
tutorials and/or user guide available at the previously cited web

page.

Step 1. Load Trajectory. The ﬁrst step required by WATCLUST is to
load in the VMD program an explicit water MD simulation set of
snapshots. Previous works from our group show that 10—20 ns
long MD simulations with ca 1000 snapshots are enough to pro—
vide converged results.

Step 2. Determine WS. Once the trajectory is loaded, the WATCLUST
plugin can be accessed in ‘Extensions > Analysis > WATCLUST’. The
plugin allows to select the parameters that deﬁne how and where the
WS are to be determined. Brieﬂy, a subgroup of residues can be se—
lected to deﬁne the region where the WS will be computed, while a
reference structure—frame (or a group of residues) for the alignment of
all the trajectory snapshots is required. Proper alignment is important
to obtain accurate results and several residue selections, e.g. only those
in the binding site, should be tested. It is important to avoid the inclu—
sion of residues with high mobility.

Step 3. Analyze WS. WS can be characterized directly in VMD, col-
ored according to WFP or R90 and analyzed using all the capabil—
ities of the VMD program. All the previously mentioned structural
and thermodynamic parameters are reported in log ﬁles for each
WS.

Step 4. Transfer WS data to Autodock. Once WS have been deter—
mined, they can be used to build modiﬁed Autodock grid maps to
perform WSBD. To obtain the biased map, a conventional oxygen
grid map should be loaded into VMD. After selection of the
desired WS, the modiﬁed grid should be saved and used for dock—

ing calculations in the usual way.

As an example (see tutorials), in Figure 1A we present WS found
in the active site of AmpC beta—lactamase. The WS are shown super—
imposed to the structure of the HTC—AmpC complex. It is clearly
seen how the best WS (i.e. with high WFP and low R90) match the
ligand oxygen groups interacting with the protein. Moreover, the
comparative docking results between WSBD and the non—biased
case (Fig. 1B) underscore the WSBD improved performance yielding

lays (RMSD 1.72 A) with the reference ligand. Figure 1C shows the
poses of the outlier results compared to the reference ligand for both
docking methods. A final remark should be made concerning the use
of WS as potential replacement sites in docking calculations.
In some cases, water molecules strongly interacting with the pro-
tein are not replaced by the ligand, but instead act as bridges
between the ligand and receptor, (Garcia—Sosa and Mancera, 2010;
Garcia—Sosa, 2013) thus careful analysis of WS should be performed
and their inclusion as part of the receptor must be evaluated.

3 Conclusion

We present an application that works as a plugin under the widely
used VMD program. Based on an explicit water MD simulation tra-
jectory, it allows the characterization of the solvent structure
through the identification and analysis of WS. The program features
are a ﬂexible definition of the WS finding algorithm, determination
of each WS structural and thermodynamical parameters and visual—
ization of results on VMD with all its functionality. The method is
thus ideally suited for studies of the solvent structure on protein
surfaces and cavities with a wide range of applications, such as (i)
determination of WS in protein—ligand binding sites and (ii) protein-
protein interaction surfaces that evidence hydrophilic hot—spots,
(iii) determination of water structure in water/ion channels and
(iv) characterization of catalytic waters, among others. It also allows
to build modified Autodock grid maps to perform WS biased dock—
ing calculations, which we have shown to give significantly better re—
sults when compared to conventional docking, especially for ligands
having hydrophilic moieties (Gauto et al., 2013; Modenutti et al.,
2015). The only drawback is that the method relies on the presence
of specific protein—water interactions, so it should not be used on
large highly hydrophobic surfaces or regions with too high mobility.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Quantification applications of short-tag sequencing data
(such as CNVseq and RNAseq) depend on knowing the uniqueness
of specific genomic regions at a given threshold of error. Here, we
present the ‘uniqueome’, a genomic resource for understanding the
uniquely mappable proportion of genomic sequences. Pre-computed
data are available for human, mouse, fly and worm genomes in both
color-space and nucletotide-space, and we demonstrate the utility
of this resource as applied to the quantification of RNAseq data.
Availability: Files, scripts and supplementary data are available from
http://grimmond.imb.uq.edu.au/uniqueome/; the ISAS uniqueome
aligner is freely available from http://www.imagenix.com/.

Massively parallel short—tag (25—100nt) sequencing technologies
are enabling a large repertoire of genomic and genetic research due
to the depth of coverage that can be achieved in a cost—effective
manner. Although short tags are most informative if they can be
aligned uniquely to a reference genome, repetitive elements are
not randomly distributed throughout the genome (Campbell et al.,
2008); therefore, the proportion and location of uniquely mappable
short sequences will also be non—randomly distributed. This presents
a speciﬁc problem where quantitative comparison between two or
more genomic regions is required (such as RNAseq or CNVseq).
For any quantitative analysis, it is desirable to understand the
boundaries of the unique genome (the uniqueome), so that the
amount of uniquely mappable sequence can be used to normalize tag
counts. Uniqueomes have been studied comprehensively for small
genomes with both long (Chaisson et al., 2004) and short (Whiteford
et al., 2005) sequencing tags. For mammalian genomes, where
comprehensive studies can be computationally prohibitive, the
problem has been tackled with simulation (Campbell et al., 2008),
region—speciﬁc computation (Robertson et al., 2008) or computation
without mismatches (Rozowsky et al., 2009). Counterintuitively,
considering only tags that align uniquely without mismatches does
not resolve the problem of ambiguous mapping. In cases where
the error rate of the sequencing platform exceeds the number
of mismatches allowed during alignment, false positive uniquely
aligning tags will occur (Supplementary Figure S1). It is therefore

important to compute the uniqueome allowing for at least the number
of errors likely to be present in the data.

We have used the exhaustive alignment feature of ISAS
(Imagenix, USA) to systematically generate uniqueome data for
human (hg18 and hgl9), mouse (mm9), worm (ce6) and ﬂy
(dm3) genomes in both color—space and nucleotide—space. Ungapped
alignments were performed independently for tag lengths between
25 and 90 nt with varying numbers of mismatches, in both
nucleotide—space and color—space (Supplementary Material).

To visualize the results, non—unique genomic regions are
formatted as bigBED and bigWig ﬁles, and these can be loaded
directly into the UCSC genome browser (Kuhn et al., 2009). The
BED ﬁles are also compatible with large—scale genomic analysis
using the Galaxy interface (Goecks et al., 2010). Figure 1 illustrates
the utility of uniqueome in identifying problematic alignment areas
in an RNAseq dataset (Guttman et al., 2010).

Table l and Supplementary Tables S l—S4 describe the proportion
of unique start sites and unique coverage for different genomes
and different tag lengths in both nucleotide—space and color—space.
Interestingly, increasing the length of the tag beyond 50 bp does little
to overcome redundancy issues in mammalian genomes, suggesting
that short—read technologies do not need to progress signiﬁcantly
beyond their current lengths to achieve optimum utility in fragment
datasets.

Fig. 2. A mirror image plot showing the relationship between the length of
a gene and the unique length of a gene for color—space (red) and nucleotide—
space (blue). The uniqueomes of human RefSeq genes (release 39) using
th9 coordinates were investigated for 50mer tags using two mismatches in
nucleotide—space and ﬁve mismatches in color—space.

To better understand the effect of mapping uniqueness on RNAseq
quantiﬁcation, we determined the proportion of uniquely mappable
positions in the RefSeq set of genes (Pruitt et al., 2007) for 50mers
in both color—space and nucleotide—space. Figure 2 shows a wide
distribution of off—diagonal points reﬂecting the variability in the
uniqueome content of RefSeq genes. Both the color—space and base—
space plots reveal a group of RefSeq transcripts >5000 nt long
but with less than 10% of uniquely mapping tags. This group of
genes is highly enriched for large multicopy gene families, such as
HLA. The uniqueness of RefSeq exon—exon junctions is described
in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6.

Overall, the effect of non—unique short sequences in genes can
be signiﬁcant. More than 25% of RefSeq genes contain at least
10% of non—unique sequence when mapped as 50mers. Given that
almost 40% of genes in mammalian genomes have arisen due to gene
duplication (Zhang, 2003), this is not a surprising result. However,
unless this is speciﬁcally normalized for in RNAseq experiments,
this could bias both differential expression and gene set enrichment

 

analyses. We have examined the utility of normalization using the
uniqueome and compared it to both raw tag counts and non—unique
tag rescue, using previously published sequencing and microarray
data from the same samples (Cloonan et al., 2008). Table 2 shows
an improvement in the correlation of RNAseq to array data when
using tag counts normalized to the proportion of unique sequence
in each gene. Although the correlation improvements are lower than
using a rescue approach, there is no additional computational time
required to achieve this improvement, whereas signiﬁcant CPU time
is required for rescue (6 CPU hours using RNA—MATEv1.1; see
Supplementary Material).

Finally, the uniqueome allows higher conﬁdence in mutation
detection (e. g. cancer resequencing), where mis—mapping can
confound SNP calling algorithms. This is a particular problem faced
by users of paired—end or mate—pair data, where the mapping position
of a multimapping tag is rescued based on its pair which uniquely
maps. It is important to note that while this rescue can lead to
improved levels of coverage (Bainbridge et al., 2010), it does not
increase the uniquely mapping proportion of the genome, and can
lead to the misplacement of tags and false positive variant calls
(Supplementary Figure S2). The uniqueome can be used to identify
these regions of low conﬁdence, independently of the aligner used
to generate the data, as illustrated in Figure 1.

Although described here as a resource for short—tag sequencing
applications, the utility of this resource extends beyond this theme.
Primer design, comparative genomics and microarray probe design
would also derive beneﬁt from this resource. A PDF tutorial on using
the uniqueome with Galaxy is provided (Supplementary Material).
The ISAS uniqueome aligner is freely available, and a PDF tutorial
on its use is provided (Supplementary Material).

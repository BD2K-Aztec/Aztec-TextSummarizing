ABSTRACT

Targeted therapies interfering with specifically one protein activity
are promising strategies in the treatment of diseases like cancer.
However, accumulated empirical experience has shown that
targeting multiple proteins in signaling networks involved in the
disease is often necessary. Thus, one important problem in
biomedical research is the design and prioritization of optimal
combinations of interventions to repress a pathological behavior,
while minimizing side-effects. OCSANA (optimal combinations of
interventions from network analysis) is a new software designed
to identify and prioritize optimal and minimal combinations of inter-
ventions to disrupt the paths between source nodes and target
nodes. When specified by the user, OCSANA seeks to additionally
minimize the side effects that a combination of interventions can
cause on specified off-target nodes. With the crucial ability to
cope with very large networks, OCSANA includes an exact solu-
tion and a novel selective enumeration approach for the combina-
torial interventions’ problem.

for Cytoscape and distributed under LGPL license, is available

1 INTRODUCTION

Cellular functions and activities are governed by complex sig-
naling and regulatory networks. Diseases arise from abnormal
behavior in these networks. Thus, the design of targeted thera-
pies from a systems biology approach aims to identify which
molecules to intervene in these networks, to repress a patho-
logical behavior while minimizing side effects. Accumulated
empirical experience has shown that combination or multi-
component interventions are necessary to cope with the redun-
dancy and multi-functionality that characterize biological
networks (Fitzgerald et al., 2006). Redundancy requires for
several pathways to be targeted, as alternate routes can com-
pensate the disrupted pathways’ function. Multi-functionality

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

implies that intervening molecules that play a central role in
the cell may cause side effects, requiring alternative points of
intervention (Samaga et al., 2010). Some methods have been
proposed to address some aspects of this problem (H'adicke
and Klamt, 2011; Haus et al., 2008; Klamt et al., 2006).
However, limited scalability of the methods and the lack of
a prioritization criterion are hindering factors for their applic-
ability to large biological networks. We introduce OCSANA, a
software for the identiﬁcation and prioritization Of optimal
minimal combinations of interventions (CIs). We deﬁne a CI
as a set of nodes such that each elementary path (a path from
source to target node) contains at least one node from this set.
This CI set indicates the nodes to be intervened to disrupt all
the identiﬁed elementary paths. The interventions can be knock
outs (deletion of genes/proteins) and knock ins (overeXpres-
sions of genes/proteins). A CI is minimal if no proper subset
of the CI is a CI itself, and its optimality is deﬁned in terms of
a heuristic scoring (see Section 2). To ensure the methods
scalability, OCSANA includes an EXACT SOLUTION Via an
adaptation of Berge’s algorithm (Berge, 1989) and a novel
SELECTIVE ENUMERATION approach based on a weighted-
greedy algorithm. The EXACT SOLUTION computes all minimal
CIs of all sizes, and, similar to (H'adicke and Klamt, 2011), it
is adapted to compute all CIs up to a speciﬁed size. The
SELECTIVE ENUMERATION computes optimal minimal CIs up to
a speciﬁed size, and it can be parametrized to identify such CIs
sets by FULL ENUMERATION.

2 METHODS

OCSANA is implemented as a plugin to the open source network ana-
lysis and Visualization software, Cytoscape (Shannon 61 al., 2003). It
uses the Java library BiNoM (Zinover et al., 2008), to facilitate the
import and analysis of networks. Based on the network’s structure,
OCSANA incorporates a scoring with three purposes: to evaluate
the optimality of nodes to become part of a CI, to efﬁciently compute
optimal solutions in the SELECTIVE ENUMERATION and to prioritize
the identiﬁed minimal C15. The scoring of a node is based on
(i) the lengths of the paths from the node of interest to the targets,
(ii) the type of effect on target nodes (e.g. activation/inhibition
effect), (iii) side effects with respect to off-target nodes, (iV) the
number of elementary paths in which the node participates and
(V) the number of targets that such node can reach simultaneously. In
the Supplementary File Suppl_AlgDescription, we provide a description
of the scoring and the algorithms underlying the software.

Algorithm 1. Algorithm outline to compute CIs

 

Input/mandatory: A network (directed signed graph), a set of source
nodes, target nodes and a set of parameters.

Input/optional: A set of complementary nodes assigned as off-target nodes
(i.e. side effects).

Output: Prioritized list of optimal CIs.

1. Pre-processing step: Compute the collection of elementary paths, that
is, paths from source nodes to target nodes according to the selected
parameters for the path analysis.

2. Score the nodes present in the elementary paths and sort them in a
descending order.

3. Compute the so-called minimal hitting sets (MHSs) for the elementary
paths according to the selected algorithm approach and sort them ac-
cording to OCSANA’s score. This sorted list of MHSs is the sought list of
prioritized optimal CIs.

 

2.1 Software features

Listed below are some of the characteristics of OCSANA’s software:

(1) Acquisition of the different tools from Cytoscape and BiNoM:
(a) A graphical user interface to launch and edit
networks, 0)) Upload of networks in BioPAX, SBGN and SBML
formats and (c) Different path analyses available for the pre-pro-
cessing step.

(2) The user can select between exact solution and selective enumer-
ation approaches.

(3) Optional analysis on side effects with respect to off-target nodes.

(4) Selection of maximum size of CIs to be identiﬁed.

(5) Visualization of results in Cytoscape.

3 PERFORMANCE TESTING AND APPLICATION

Testing performance. We used three biological networks ofincreas-
ing size. The interaction graph for Epidermal Growth Factor
Receptor (EGFR) signaling introduced by (Samaga et al., 2009),
an Epidermal Growth Factor Family (ErbB) family signaling net-
work involved in breast cancer and a human epidermal growth
factor receptor 2 positive breast cancer network (HER2+ BCN).
All the details on the computations and results are included in the
Supplementary File Supp2_PerformanceGraphs. We tested
OCSANA’s time performance to compute all CIs up to size 5
(and 6 as well for the HER2+ BCN) by its EXACT SOLUTION
(Berges’s algorithm) and compared it with its SELECTIVE
ENUMERATION considering either FULL ENUMERATION (exhaustive
search) or by reducing the search space to the most optimal can-
didate CIs (optimal solutions). All the details on the computations
and results are included in the Supplementary File
Supp2_PerformanceGraphs. In Figure l, we present a summary
of the results across the three different path analyses available in
OCSANA:

EGFR network. Across the different algorithms and path ana-
lyses, the time performance is identical.

ERbB family network. For shortest and optimal and subopti-
mal path analyses, Berge’s algorithm is slower than FULL

Fig. 1. Comparison of OCSANA’s performance on three different biological networks under different choices of path analyses. Rows A1, B1 and Cl
show the characteristics of each network. Rows A2, B2 and C2 show the number of elementary paths and nodes according to the selected source nodes
and target nodes in each network. On rows A3, B3 and C3, we present OCSANA’s time performance using Berges algorithm to compute all CIs up to
size 5. Rows A4, B4 and C4 show the time performance to compute with the FULL ENUMERATION all CIs up to size 5; the full enumeration is done
considering the SELECTIVE ENUMERATION parametrized to perform an exhaustive search. On rows A5, B5 and C5, we show the time performance to
compute all CIs up to size 5 by SELECTIVE ENUMERATION, reducing the search space to consider only optimal candidate CIs. Finally, on rows C5, C6 and
C7, it is shown OCSANA’s time performance to compute all CIs up to size 6 by Berge’s algorithm, FULL ENUMERATION and SELECTIVE ENUMERATION.
All computation were made on a desktop computer with a quad-core Intel® Xeon® CPU X5472 3.00 Ghz processor and 12 GB of random access

memory

ENUMERATION. For the all non—self—intersecting path analysis,
Berge’s approach outperforms the FULL ENUMERATION. Across
the different path analyses, the SELECTIVE ENUMERATION outper-
forms Berge’s algorithm. Finally, we see that for the three path
analyses, at most 12% of the search space was needed in the
SELECTIVE ENUMERATION, thus providing evidence that
OCSANAs scoring aids to correctly identify all CIs within its
optimal solutions.

HER2+ BCN. Under shortest path analysis, the EXACT
SOLUTION performs poorer in comparison with FULL
ENUMERATION and SELECTIVE ENUMERATION to compute all CIs
up to size 5 and 6. For example, to compute all CIs up to size 6,
the EXACT SOLUTION takes >10 h, whereas SELECTIVE
ENUMERATION takes ~8 min to ﬁnd the same set of CIs obtained
by the EXACT SOLUTION. To compute CIs up to size 5 under opti-
mal and suboptimal and all non—self—intersecting paths analyses,
the EXACT SOLUTION outperforms the FULL ENUMERATION,
whereas the SELECTIVE ENUMERATION outperforms the
EXACT SOLUTION. We observe that none of the algorithms
was able to compute all CIs up to size 6 in <12h. In this
case, a method allowing ﬁnding a signiﬁcant number of CIs
in a reasonable time becomes useful. Thereupon, we
show that the SELECTIVE ENUMERATION ﬁnds 40% of all the
CIs up to size 6 in just 95s (the total number of CIs
was obtained by letting the EXACT SOLUTION run for more than
a day).

Application example. Using the cell-fate decision network by
(Calzone et al., 2010), in the Supp3_ApplicationExample ﬁle,
we present an application of OCSANA to identify therapeutic
CIs. We show that our ﬁndings are complementary to the basic
network theory approaches, and we validated them with recent
literature.

4 FUTURE WORK

Future work will include modiﬁcations in the scoring method to
incorporate biological data available (e. g. gene expression levels).
We also contemplate to including a more realistic model of signal
propagation and incorporating it in the heuristic scoring.

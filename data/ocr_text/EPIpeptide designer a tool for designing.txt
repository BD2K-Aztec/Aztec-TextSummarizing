Abstract

Motivation: Antibodies are an important class of biological drugs, but with limitations, such as
inadequate pharmacokinetics, adverse immunogenicity and high production costs. Synthetic pep—
tides for the desired target represent an important alternative to antibodies. However, no computa—
tional tool exists to guide the design of these peptides.

Results: To identify the interacting residues in a given antibody—antigen (Ab—Ag) interface we used
Interface Interacting Residue (12R), a selection method based on computed molecular interactions.
The aggregation of all the molecular interactions between epitope and paratope residues allowed
us to transform the 3D Ab—Ag complex structures into interface graphs. Based on these data and
the probability of molecular interaction we developed EPI—Peptide Designer tool that uses predicted
paratope residues for an epitope of interest to generate targeted peptide ligand libraries. EPI—
Peptide Designer successfully predicted 301 peptides able to bind to LiD1 target protein (65% of the
experimentally tested peptides), an enrichment of 22% compared to randomly generated peptides.
This tool should enable the development of a new generation of synthetic interacting peptides that
could be very useful in the biosensor, diagnostic and therapeutic fields.

1 Introduction

Protein—protein interactions are at the heart of biological processes
and protein functions are highly related to their binding properties
(Chakrabarti and Janin, 2002). For instance, the immune response
relies on antigen recognition by a specific antibody and the anti—
body—antigen (Ab—Ag) complex represents a specific type of pro—
tein—protein interaction characterized by high affinity and
specificity. Identifying the key residues and interaction patterns on

the Ab—Ag interface could help improving antibody humanization
as well as the design of new antibodies (Morea et 61]., 2000) and pep—
tide ligands based on the antibody properties.

The use of peptides for therapeutic purpose instead of antibodies
has plenty of advantages such as lower manufacturing costs, less im—
munogenic profile, greater stability and better organ/tumor penetra—
tion. Several chemical approaches have been generated to overcome
therapeutic peptides limitations such as low oral bioavailability and

biodistribution (Vlieghe et 61]., 2010). Indeed, much research effort is
focused on the use of peptide ligands as a viable alternative to anti—
bodies in targeted therapies (Wada, 2013). For instance, mimetic pep—
tides derived from the anti—HERZ/ERBB antibody can inhibit the
tyrosine kinase activity of this receptor and consequently impair tu—
mour growth (Park et 61]., 2000; Ponde et 61]., 2011). Presently, over
50 peptide drugs are approved for clinical use (Reichert et 61]., 2010).
To guide the design and increase the affinity and specificity of these
peptide drugs, different tools, based on various methodologies (e.g.
directed evolution, high—throughput protein screening or rational de—
sign based on protein—peptide interactions) have emerged (Pei and
Wavreille, 2007; Vanhee et 61]., 2011; Yin et 61]., 2007). In silica ra—
tional design of peptides based on molecular interactions is also a fun—
damental proof—of—concept for the current understanding of the
physical—chemical basis of molecular recognition. Moreover, this ap—
proach could become a powerful complement to the current library-
based screening methods because it allows targeting specific patches
on the surface of a protein (Fleishman et 61]., 2011). Computational
design also gives the opportunity to program protein—protein inter-
actions for specific applications. However, currently no computa—
tional methodology to design this kind of peptides is available.

In this work, we propose a computational method to generate
libraries of peptide ligands or paratope mimetics based on the epit—
ope—paratope interaction (EPI) patterns and on a target epitope input
sequence. This software, called EPI—Peptide Designer, uses a set of
Ab—Ag complex structures from the Protein Data Bank (PDB)
(Berman et 61]., 2000) and the Blue Star STING server and STING_DB
(Neshich et 61]., 2006) containing hundreds of interaction descriptors
reported in residue by residue fashion to compute the Bayesian proba—
bilities of molecular interactions between epitope and paratope. EPI—
Peptide Designer generates peptide binder sequences based on the epi—
tope sequence entered by the user and the patterns extracted from the
Ab—Ag interfaces. The method was experimentally validated using as
target a dermonecrotic protein LiD1 from the brown spider venom.
We have synthesized a library of 460 peptides and 65% of them were
able to bind to LiD1. In addition, 460 random peptide were designed
in which 43% of them were positives. These results indicate an
enrichement of 22% in ligand peptides designed using EPI—Peptide
Desginer. This is, to our knowledge, the first generator of peptide lig—
and libraries based on epitope—paratope interface.

2 Methods

2.1 Dataset extraction and interface selection

Structures from Ab—Ag used in this work were extracted from
SAbDab (Dunbar et 61]., 2014). Were selected all structure with pro—
tein/peptide antigen and from this set, only structures resolved by
X—ray and a resolution lower or equal to 3  were kept. To analyze
the interface of Ab—Ag complexes, we used three different interface
selection methods. First, in the selection based on the distance be—
tween atoms of the antigen and the antibody (distance—based selec—
tion, DBS) (Chothia and Janin, 1975; L0 Conte et 61]., 1999), an
amino acid of the antigen is considered to be part of the Distance
Selected Epitope (DSE), if one or more of its atoms are at a distance
below a chosen cut—off (in our study, from 3 to 8 A). The distance
selected paratope (DSP) is selected in the same manner. Second, in
the approach based on the difference of solvent accessible surface
(ASAS), interfaces are selected based on the loss of solvent accessibil—
ity between the separated and the complexed protein (L0 Conte
et 61]., 1999). Third, we developed a selection method in which the

interface computed molecular interactions are extracted from

STING RDB (Neshich et 61]., 2006). In this method, the interface is
defined by all the amino acids that are involved in the molecular
interactions between the antigen and the antibody chains and that
are called, therefore, interface interacting residues (12R). The se—
lected antibody residues form the 12R paratope and the selected anti—
gen amino acids constitute the 12R epitope.

2.2 Computation ofthe interface molecular

interactions

Molecular interactions (salt bridges, hydrogen bonds, aromatic
stacking and hydrophobic interactions) were taken from STING
RDB IFR (Mancini et al., 2004). This tool identifies all potential
intra— and inter—protein chain contacts stored in STING RDB
(Neshich et 61]., 2006) by (i) classifying the atoms in groups accord—
ing to their electrostatic behavior and position in the amino acid
(main or side chain) and (ii) by then selecting atoms based on the
type of contacts they potentially can make and on the experimen-
tally defined distance restrictions (Harris and Mildvan, 1999;
Sobolev et 61]., 1999; Swindells, 1995).

2.3 Redundancy removal

To extract meaningful information from the interface dataset, one
firstly removed structure with the same antigen name and keeping
the lowest resolution one and secondly removed redundancies by se—
lecting only the DSE and DSP sequences from the complex (with a
cut—off of 6 A). Using the CD—Hit global sequence identity score (Fu
et 61]., 2012), we only selected interfaces with a score lower than
0.90 for both interface sides. Global sequence identity score is define
as the number of identical amino acids in alignment divided by the
length of the shorter sequence. The selected files were manually
curated to confirm their quality. This provided us with a non—redun—
dant dataset composed of 272 PDB structures, 51 antibody—peptide
complexes (here, peptides are defined as molecules smaller than 30
amino acids) and 221 antibody—protein complex.

2.4 Interface statistical analysis
To compute the percentage of occurrence (% Occ) of the epitopes
and paratopes selected by 12R one used:

()ccn

OCCtotal

 

%Occ,, : X 100,

where n is an amino acids, %Occn is the percentage of occurrence of
n, Occn is the occurrence of n and Occtotal is the occurrence of all
the residues. The results were compared to all STING RDB protein—
protein interaction (Neshich et 61]., 2006) occurrence values after ex—
clusion of our 101 PDB Files. The statistical comparison of the
amino acids was done using a t test of differential distribution and
was considered significant when the P—value was lower than 0.01.

2.5 Comparison of the interface selection methods

To compare the interface residue selection by the three methods we
computed the Receiver operating prime curve (ROC’) of the per—
formance of the distance—based selection and ASAS, using various
cut—offs, against 12R. As the aim was the comparison of selected
interface residues, the true negatives were not considered. We com—
puted the ROC’ curve as follows. The true positive rate (TPR), also
called recall, was computed as:

TP

and the false discovery rate (FDR) as:

FP

FDR:—
FP-l-TP

where TP is the true positive, FP the false positive and FN the false
negative.

2.6 Computation ofthe most frequent interface partners
using graph analysis

To analyze the interface in a multi—level manner, we developed inter—
face to graph generator (IGG). IGG is a BioJava program that takes
as input PDB codes and two sets of chains. Molecular interactions
between those two sets are recovered from PDB structures using
STING RDB (Neshich et al., 2006). The interface is automatically
transformed into a graph, where all IZRs are vertices and all inter—
actions are edges. The vertex label holds the information concerning
the interface side and the amino acid type (Table 1). The edges are
labelled according to the type of interaction, such as hydrogen
bonds, salt bridges, hydrophobic interactions and aromatic stacking.
Using GASTON (Nijssen and Kok, 2004), the most conserved sub—
graphs were extracted from the complete set of interfaces containing
two and three nodes. Subgraphs plot was done using R (R
Development Core Team, 2008) and the ‘igraph’ package (Csardi
and Nepusz, 2006).

2.7 Assessment of paratope residue prediction

Based on the Bayesian probabilities extracted from the epitope—par—
atope graphs, the amino acid sequence and the interaction of a given
paratope were predicted using a given epitope sequence. To evaluate
the prediction of residues and interactions, using a 10—fold cross val—
idation on the complete dataset. The evaluation considered each
residue from the input epitope and defined as True Positive (TP) a
correct ‘interaction type and paratope residue’ couple, as false posi—
tive (FP) any interaction where the interaction type or the residue
group was incorrect, as false negative (FN) any existing couple not
added by the program and as true negative (TN) any possible not
existing and not added interaction type—paratope residue couple.

2.8 EPI—peptide design tool

Using all the Ab—Ag interaction patterns and the residue occurrence
data obtained in this study, we developed EPI—Peptide Designer in
BioJava. EPI—Peptide Designer includes the IGG program described
above. The program takes as input a real or putative epitope se—
quence (linear or conformational; gaps in the sequence can be repre—
sented by —), a cut—off score representing the importance of the
epitope sequence in the design and the number and size of peptides
needed by the user. To design peptide ligands, EPI—Peptide Designer
uses the Base Residue Library (BRL) composed of all residues from
all the paratopes in the input dataset. The computed probabilities

include: probability of an epitope residue type to do an interaction
and, for each type of interaction, the probability of the target para—
tope residue type and the inﬂuence of the epitope neighbour residues
on the interaction. Using these probabilities and the input sequence,
EPI-Peptide Designer ranks the predicted paratope residues in
decreasing order of likelihood. The paratope residues are then added
according to the decreasing order of likelihood to the BRL until the
defined cut—off score is reached (i.e. for a BRL of 100 residues and a
cut—off score of 10%, EPI—Peptide Designer will add 10 residues to
the BRL). The thus obtained biased amino acid library (i.e. modified
to become specific for a given epitope sequence) is then used to gen—
erate random EPI—peptide sequences of the length and in the number
defined by the user.

2.9 EPI—peptide design and random peptides

generation

In order to test the effectiveness of the method, 800 EPI—Peptides were
generated using the protein LiD1 (GI: 33348850, Felicori et al., 2006)
catalytic sequence epitope (37FDDNANPEYTYHGIP51) and default
parameter of EPI—Peptide Designer (Ab—peptide dataset, length of 15
amino acid and a score of 50). To ensure solubility, only sequences
which contained less than 50% hydrophobic residues; at least 25% of
charged residues and less than 75% of D, E, H, K, N, Q, R, S, T and
Y were selected and synthesized (Following recommendations from
Life technologies peptide solubility website, http://www.lifetechnolo
gies.com). Random peptide sequences were generated using the
expasy tool RandSeq (Gasteiger et al., 2003) using the average amino
acid composition from the Uniprot/Swiss—Prot database and filtered
following the same methodology than the EPI—pepitde. The statistic
used by the program for the different amino acids are: Ala: 8.26, Gln:
3.93, Leu: 9.66, Ser: 6.59, Arg: 5.53, Glu: 6.74, Lys: 5.83, Thr: 5.34,
Asn: 4.06, Gly: 7.08, Met: 2.41, Trp: 1.09, Asp: 5.46, His: 2.27, Phe:
3.86, Tyr: 2.92, Cys: 1.37, Ile: 5.94, Pro: 4.71, Val: 6.87.

2.10 Peptide synthesis on cellulose membranes and
binding assay

Two membranes with four hundred and sixty peptides each were
synthesized on a cellulose membrane as previously described by
Laune et al. (2002). One of the membranes corresponding to Epi-
peptides and other to random peptides. The membranes were
blocked by incubation with 137mM NaCl, 2.68 mM KCl, 3%
sacarose, 5% bovine serum albumin, 0.1% tween 20 in 50 mM Tris
base at room temperature overnight. Then membranes were probed
LiD1 covalently linked to biotin at a concentration of 20ug/ml in
blocking buffer at room temperature for 90 min. Biotinalytion of
LiD1 was conducted using commercial available Biotinylation kit
(Sigma—Aldrich, BK101). Protein binding was revealed by incuba—
tion (at room temperature for 90 min) with alkaline phosphatase—
conjugated avidin (1:10 000) and 5—bromo—4—chlor0—3—indolyl phos-
phate (BCIP) plus 3—(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazo-
lium bromide (MTT) as substrate. To remove molecules and
precipitated blue die attached, membranes were sequentially treated
with dimethylformamide, 1% SDS, 0.1% 2—mercaptoethanol in 8 M
urea, ethanol/water/acetic acid (50:40:10, vol/vol/vol) and, finally,
methanol and further employed in other assays. Peptide reactivity
was assessed based on manual reading and consensus of triplicate
assays. Positive sequences were analyzed by GibbsCluster
(Andreatta et al., 2013) and Weblogo (Crooks et al., 2004) tools.
Statistical analysis comparing the success of binding were done using
binomial test.

3 Results

3.1 Analysis of the interface interacting residues (12R)
allows evaluating the distance—based selection and the
difference of solvent—accessible surface methods

To compare the three interface residue selection techniques, we se—
lected interfaces from the 272 PDB structures by computing the
Euclidean distance DBS, the ASAS and the interface molecular

DBS and ASAS methods against the IZRs by computing the ROC’
curves (Fig. 1). Comparison of the selection made based on the
Euclidean distance with the extracted IZRs showed that the max—
imum precision was obtained with a 3  distance, while the max—
imum TPR (also called Recall) was reached with 8  The DBS had
a higher surface under the curve and the highest value of TPR — FDR
was reached for a distance of 3.8  Most DBS—based Ab—Ag struc—
ture studies use a cut—off between 4 and 6  For a distance of 5 A,
with this plot, 91.4% (TPR) of interacting residues were selected;
however, 36% of the selected residues did not do any kind of inter-
action. Surprisingly, to reach the maximum TPR, a distance cut—off
of 8  was needed. As most of the molecular interaction maximum
distances are lower than 6 A, we further investigated the interaction
repartition.

As all interface interactions are not selected by the 5  cut—off,
we were interested in the interaction repartition in function of the
distance. The bar plots (Fig. 2A) of the interactions relative to the
chosen distance showed that the distance of 5 A, as expected based
on the previous results, allowed the selection of most interactions,
but still missed 3.9% of them, specifically 6.7% of all salt bridges,
4.5% of all hydrogen bonds and 7.8% of all aromatic stacking, but
none of the hydrophobic interactions. The hydrogen bonds with a
distance bigger than 5  were all water—mediated, thus explaining
the unusual long distance. The cumulative bar plot of the inter—
actions (Fig. 2B) showed that the hydrophobic interactions were
quantitatively the most important, followed closely by hydrogen
bonds. Conversely, salt bridges and aromatic stacking were less fre—
quent on the antibody—antigen interface.

3.2 Amino acid occurrence in epitopes and paratopes
selected with the interface interacting residue (12R)
method

Compared to all interacting residues in STING RDB, 12R paratopes
(grey columns in Fig. 3) were significantly enriched in Tyr, Ser, Trp,
Gly, Asn and Thr. 12R paratopes were depleted of most of the other
amino acids, but for Ala, Asp and Phe the occurrence of which was
not significantly different compared with all STING RDB interact-
ing residues. 12R epitopes (black columns in Fig. 3) were enriched in
Gly, Pro, Asn, Gln, Ser, Thr and Cys and depleted of Glu, Arg, His,
Phe and Tyr.

PARATOPE

Fig. 4. The bipartite graph representation of the molecular interactions between I2R paratopes and I2R epitopes highlight the strong asymmetric pattern of epitope—

paratope interactions. The sphere size of each residue is proportional to the amino acid occurrence in its respective side. The vertex width is proportional to the occu r-
rence of the specific type of interaction; green, hydrogen bonds; blue, hydrophobic interactions; orange, attractive salt bridges; black, repulsive salt bridges; red, aro-
matic stacking. Only vertices with an occurrence higher than 50 are represented (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

A bipartite graph representation of the paratope—epitope inter—
actions indicated that the interacting residues had a very asymmetric
distribution (Fig. 4). In the paratope, Tyr, the most frequent residue,
interacted with almost all the epitopic amino acids via different
types of interactions. Tyr interacted most frequently with hydropho—
bic amino acids, particularly Pro, Gln, Gly, Phe and with the
charged Lys and Arg in the epitope. Indeed, paratopic Tyr interacted
with positively charged epitopic residues via cation—7t interactions
and with negatively charged epitopic residues via hydrogen bonds.
The Ser in the paratope seemed important for establishing a network
of hydrogen bonds with charged amino acids and also with Gln and
Ser in the epitope. Among the charged amino acids in the paratope,
a high prevalence of salt bridges done by Arg and Asp was observed.
More heterogeneous interactions were observed among the epitope
residues. Although Arg was less frequent than in other kinds of pro-
tein—protein interactions (Fig. 4), it was the most frequent residue in
epitopes and was involved in all kinds of interactions. Epitopic Arg
interacted mostly with Tyr residues in the paratope via aromatic
stacking, hydrogen bonds and hydrophobic interactions. It also
formed salt bridges preferentially with Asp, but also with Glu, and
repulsive salt bridges with Arg in the paratope. Lys in the epitope
formed a similar network with Tyr in the paratope.

3.3 The most conserved subgraphs highlight the
importance of cation—7t interactions in the epitope—

pa ratope interface

The extraction of the most conserved subgraphs from the complete
dataset with two of the three nodes showed that paratopic aromatic
residues (Tyr) predominantly interacted with positively charged resi—
dues in the epitope through an aromatic stacking interaction (cat—
ion-7t interaction) (Fig. 5A). Specifically, 224 of the 272 selected
structures contained at least one cation—7t interaction in which the
positive charge was hold by the epitope. In addition the six
most conserved subgraphs with three or more nodes all contains a

3.4 Assessment of the paratope residue prediction

Using these antibody—antigen graph patterns, we then developed a
new methodology to design antibody mimetics using the antigen se—
quence Figure 6. First, we computed the Bayesian probability of all
kinds of interactions to predict the residue—interaction couples.
Then, to test the predictions, we used the full dataset and a 10—fold
cross validation method with all the interactions and the seven resi—
due groups (Table 1). The prediction program includes two tuning
parameters. First, the probability cut—off which determine if an inter-
action is added or not and the ’inﬂuence’ corresponding to the
weight of the neighbour residues on the probability value. Those
two parameters were tuned in order to obtain maximum sensitivity.
The best results was reached with a probability cut—off of 0.1, and
an influence of 3.5 obtaining a sensitivity of 66% and a specificity
of 70%. These results indicate that the residues selected to compose
the predicted ligand peptides are not random.

3.5 EPI—peptide designer tool

From a set of user—defined Ab—Ag complexes (Fig. 6A), the EPI-
Peptide Designer computed the graph representation of the inter—
faces (Fig. 6B). Then, from the set of graphs, the program computed
the amino acid occurrence in the second side (in our study the para—
tope) and the interaction probability (Fig. 6C and D). To demon—
strate how the EPI—Peptide Designer works, we used the epitope
from the LiD1 protein. Using a score of 50% (representing the im—
portance of the epitope sequence in the design), the percentage of oc—
currence of five amino acids from the BRL was modified by at least
2% (see Fig. 6E).

3.6 Predicted EPI—peptides are able to bind to target

LiD1 protein

To test the ability of EPI—peptide designer to successfully predict
peptides able to bind to the epitope (37FDDNANPEYTYHGIP51) of
LiD1 protein, 460 peptides were predicted (Supplementary Table
Sl), chemically synthesized and assayed against biotinylated LiD1.
From 460 sequences synthesized, 218 were considered highly posi—
tive (47% of sequences, squares on Fig. 7A) and 83 had a lower re—
activity (18%), a total of 301 reactive peptides. 159 peptides (35%)
presented no reactivity. Highly positive peptides were clustered in
two groups and a graphical representation of the patterns from each
multiple sequence alignment was computed (Fig. 7B and C). Cluster
1 (Supplementary Table 81) contains 107 sequences and shows two
conserved tyrosine at position 9 (59%) and 10 (41%) as well as two
conserved arginines (positions 14 and 15). The second most frequent
amino acid in those positions is also aromatic (Trp). Similarly, the
cluster 2 (Supplementary Table S2) includes two conserved tyrosines
at position 14 and 15 (53 and 54% respectively). In order to address
the ability of EPI—peptide Designer to perform a better peptide pre—
diction compared to random generate peptides, 460 random pep—
tides were generated using Swiss—Prot/Uniprot amino acid statistic
(Supplementary Table 82) and tested against LiD1—biotin using the
same experimental conditions. From these peptides, 128 were con—
sidered highly positive (28% of sequences) and 71 presented lower
reactivity (15%), a total of 199 reactive peptides, corresponding to
43% of reactivity (102 less than Epi—peptide prediction). 261 pep—
tides (57%) were not reactive (Supplementary Fig. 18). The peptides
were also probed against biotin alone (Supplementary Fig. 28) with-
out any reactivity observed. With these results, we can conclude that
EPI—peptides show an increase of 22% of the success in term of bind—
ing corresponding to a P—value of 2.2e_16 using a binomial test com—
pared to the randomly generated peptides.

4 Discussion

To overcome the many antibody limitations, such as their inad—
equate pharmacokinetics, poor tissue accessibility and adverse im—
munogenicity including high production costs, enormous efforts
have been focused on finding alternative strategies (Yin and
Hamilton, 2005), such as non—peptidic protein binders (Margulies
and Hamilton, 2010), smaller antibody fragments that retain the
original binding property (Holliger and Hudson, 2005; Hudson
and Souriau, 2003; Nelson and ert, 2009) and even peptidomimet—
ics inferred from the antibody Complementarity Determining
Region (CDR) (Wada, 2013). The generation of CDR—derived pep—
tidomimetics is challenging, but it would pave the way to larger
biomedical (therapeutic and diagnostic) applications (Fontenot
et al., 1998; Park et al., 2000; Ponde et al., 2011; Timmerman
et al., 2009, 2010). However, it has been shown that some pos—
itions within the CDRs never participate in antigen binding and
some off—CDR residues often contribute critically to the interaction
with the antigen (Sela—Culang et al., 2012). For this reason, the
present work proposes a new in silico methodology to design tar—
geted libraries of ligand peptides that is not based on CDRs, but on
the amino acids that are important for the interaction with the
antigen. The design of these peptides is not arbitrary, but based on
the antigen sequence.

The first step to develop this methodology was to better under—
stand the Ab—Ag interactions. Specifically, we identified the amino
acids that are most frequently present in the epitope—paratope inter—
actions, the most frequent physicochemical types of interactions and
the most frequent partners in these interactions.

The amino acid frequency in the Ab—Ag interface was analyzed
in several previous works. However, different cut—offs and method—
ologies were used to determine the interface boundaries, such as the
distance between atoms of the antigen and the antibody (DBS) and
the difference of solvent—accessible surface (ASAS). Here, we de—
veloped a new method based on the interface molecular contact
(12R) to extract from the Ab—Ag interface only the amino acids that
make interactions, using the STING database (Neshich et al., 2006).
By comparing the selections obtained using the 12R, DBS and ASAS
methods, we show that DBS and ASAS missed part of the interacting
residues that are important for the interface. Indeed, with a distance
cut—off of 8 A, more than 60% of the amino acids that do not inter—
act are selected in addition to the amino acids that do interactions.
With a distance cut—off of 4 A, more than 8% of interacting residues
are not selected and more than 20% of selected residues are not
involved in interactions.

The 12R method also allowed studying the type of interactions
and gave an approximation of the residue energetic contribution to

the interface in a fast and easy way. Moreover, this selection method
could be used to select targets for free—energy perturbation (FEP)
(Xia et al., 2012), or to identify binding hot—spots to facilitate the
humanization of mouse antibodies (Hanf et al., 2013). As previously
noted with other selection techniques (Kringelum et al., 2012;
Ramaraj et al., 2012; Rubinstein et al., 2008), we found that the
paratope was significantly enriched in Tyr, Ser and Trp residues.
However, by comparing the occurrence of the IZR—selected amino
acids and of all protein—protein interactions found in the STING
database (Neshich et al., 2006), we found that the occurrence of
most of the Ab—Ag interface residues was significantly different (but
not for Ala, Glu and Phe), thus characterizing the antigen—antibody
interface as a special kind of protein—protein interaction.
Concerning the extraction of the most frequent partners, we high—
lighted the importance of the cation—7t interaction. Dalkas et al.
(2014) previously reported that this type of interaction represents
only 5% of the Ab—Ag interfaces, whereas in our study 224 of the
272 structures contained at least one cation—7t interaction, where the
positive charge is hold by the epitope. Moreover, 59 of them con—
tained a double cation—7t interaction composed of a positively
charged residue in the epitope that interacted with two aromatic
amino acids from the paratope. These results suggest that the cat—
ion-7t interaction is highly conserved in antigen—antibody interfaces
but with low frequency as showed by Dalkas et al.

Besides gaining insights into the antigen—antibody interface char—
acteristics, in this work we also describe a methodology to design
peptide ligands based on the epitope—paratope interface. In addition,
this methodology was experimentally validated showing an enrich-
ment of 22% of reactive peptides comparing to random generate
peptides. The most reactive EPI—peptides designed contain two con—
secutive conserved Tyr, a key residue in paratopes. Moreover, those
Tyr could interact with hydrophobic amino acids from LiD1 epitope
sequence (Phe37, Pro 43, Gly 49, Pro 51) or positively charged resi—
due (Hys 48) via cation—7t or even negatively charged residues via
hydrogen bond (Asp 38 and Asp 39).

The computational design protocol is far from perfect because it
does not take into account the antibody structural properties.
However, strategies, such as cysteine—constrained peptides, could be
employed to mimic antibody loops as shown by Burns et al. (2008)
and thus force a constrained conformation of our predicted peptides.
In conclusion, our study provides insights into the principles that guide
Ab—Ag interactions and describes an original methodology (EPI-
Peptide Designer) to design ligand peptide libraries, based on a given
antigen sequence. These targeted peptide ligand libraries might be use—
ful for proteomic and high—throughput analyses for antigen character—
ization because they minimize the work to produce antibodies in viz/o.
Finally, this methodology might guide the development of a new gen—
eration of biosensors as well as therapeutic and diagnostic molecules.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
have found many common genetic variants associated with human
diseases, it remains a challenge to elucidate the functional links
between associated variants and complex traits.

Results: We developed a package called eResponseNet by
implementing and extending the existing ResponseNet algorithm
for prioritizing candidate disease genes through cellular pathways.
Using type II diabetes (T 2D) as a study case, we demonstrate
that eResponseNet outperforms currently available approaches in
prioritizing candidate disease genes. More importantly, the package
is instrumental in revealing cellular pathways underlying disease-
associated genetic variations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have uncovered
hundreds of common genetic variants contributing to human
diseases. Various methods have been developed to translate
statistical associations into biological functions, such as
identiﬁcation of expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) using
expression proﬁles (Doss et al., 2005; Heinig et al., 2010) or
prediction of disease causative genes linked with single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) using biological networks (Lage et al.,
2007; Wu et al., 2008).

However, it is still an enormous gap to understand the biological
mechanisms by which each DNA variation affects disease risk
(Frazer et al., 2009). Here, to address this gap, we developed
a computational package by implementing and extending the
ResponseNet algorithm. We showed that the extended package
‘eResponseNet’ can effectively prioritize candidate disease genes
linked to disease—associated SNPs and uncover cellular pathways
underlying disease—associated human genetic variations.

2 METHODS

2.1 Implementing the ResponseNet

We implemented the ResponseNet algorithm, originally designed to
identify pathways linking genetic screen hits to transcriptional changes
(Yeger—Lotem er al., 2009), using C/perl language and GLPK package
(www.gnu.org/software/glpk). The ResponseNet algorithm is a minimum—
cost ﬂow optimization algorithm where ﬂow goes from source nodes (genetic
hits) to sink nodes (differentially expressed genes) through a weighted
network, where each node or edge has been assigned a weight according
to its conﬁdence; edges are associated with a capacity that limits the ﬂow
and with a cost. The problem can be described as a linear programming
formula that minimizes the overall cost of the network when distributing the
maximal ﬂow from source nodes to sink nodes (Yeger—Lotem er al., 2009)

iEV,jEV iESource

where wij and fij represents the weight and the ﬂow of edge connecting gene 1'
and j , respectively; —log(w,-j) represents the cost of the edge; S is an auxiliary
node pointing to the source nodes. The choice of the tuning parameter 7/
primarily determines the size and the quality of the output subnetwork.
Higher 7/ values will allow more connections between the source and the
sink genes but with lower conﬁdence (Yeger—Lotem er al., 2009).

2.2 Extending the ResponseNet

We designed the eResponseNet package to prioritize candidate disease genes
or genes associated with a certain phenotype/trait, meanwhile, to predict the
molecular interactions among these genes leading to the disease or trait.
Instead of ﬁxing the parameter 7/ to a default value in ResponseNet, we scan
through a range of 7/ values (between 4 and 10 with increments of 0.05)
to identify a series of optimal subnetworks from a weighted interactome.
Then, to rank each candidate gene’s relevance to the disease (network), the
candidate genes was assigned a minimal parameter 7/ when the candidate
gene ﬁrst appears in an optimal subnetwork. The smaller the minimal
parameter 7/, the higher the priority is given to the gene. A summary of
setting parameter 7/ and the main differences between eResponseNet and
ResponseNet is presented in the Supplementary Material.

in prioritizing candidate disease genes. All T2D candidate genes
surrounding GWAS loci were considered as sources, while
signiﬁcantly differentially expressed genes detected by microarrays
as sinks. A series of subnetworks were calculated from a weighted
human interactome network integrated from three sources KEGG
HPRD and STRING, upon varying the parameter y. Each of the
candidate genes was assigned a minimal parameter y (Section 2).

As our expectation, the genes assigned with lower y are
preferentially more enriched in genetic association database
(GAD) (Becker et al., 2004)—annotated T2D genes (Supplementary
Material) in the subnetworks (Supplementary Fig. 81). The
performance of prioritizing candidate disease genes by the minimal
parameter y in eResponseNet outperforms the gene ranking criteria
by the amount of ﬂow used in the original ResponseNet algorithm
(Fig. 1A and Supplementary Table S 1). Furthermore, in our dataset,
its performance is even better than the random walk (Kohler
et al., 2008) (Fig. 1A), a best—performing algorithm in prioritizing
candidate disease genes. By using the genes co—cited with diabetes
(‘literature diabetes genes’, Supplementary Material) as another
golden standard positive (GSP) set less biased for GWAS loci,
we also conﬁrmed that the performance of eResponseNet was
not depending on the particular datasets or GSPs (Fig. 1A and
Supplementary Fig. 82A).

3.2 Uncovering cellular pathways underlying
T2D-associated genetic variations

We further examined whether the subnetworks identiﬁed by
eResponseNet can explain the molecular mechanisms of how these
DNA variations affect disease risk. To this end, we found that
the mediator genes connecting sources and sinks included many
well—known T2D causative genes, such as AR, IFNG and SOCSl
(Fig. 1B and Supplementary Fig. S2B), suggesting that some of the
genes within T2D—associated loci (e.g. IDE and LEPR) affect T2D
susceptibility by acting through or together with the known T2D
causative genes. Indeed, our predicted pathways are consistent with
reported mouse knock—out phenotypes and molecular interactions
in the existing literature (Supplementary Material). In addition, the
pathways also linked these genes to other genes previously unknown
to affect T2D susceptibility, which are potentially new mediators
to the disease. Overall, compared with those in full network, the
mediator genes identiﬁed by eResponseNet were on average 2—fold
more enriched for both the GAD and the literature diabetes genes,
with the latter GSP which favors the mediator nodes more than the
source nodes (Fig. 1C and Supplementary Fig. 82C).

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we present eResponseNet, a package demonstrated
effective for prioritizing candidate disease genes and identifying
their underlying molecular pathways to human disease. This method
apparently can be generalized to analyzing any complex disease and
can be used to link any two layers of ‘omics’ data, including not only
the SNPs to gene expression (as described here), but also epigenomic
or microRNA data to gene expression, gene expression to proteomic
or metabolic data and so on.

The eResponseNet output ﬁles can be directly visualized in
Cytoscape (Supplementary Material).

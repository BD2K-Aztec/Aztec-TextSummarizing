ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenes derived
from a precursor (pre-miRNA) and involved in post-transcriptional
regulation. Experimental identification of novel miRNAs is difficult
because they are often transcribed under specific conditions and cell
types. Several computational methods were developed to detect new
miRNAs starting from known ones or from deep sequencing data,
and to validate their pre—miRNAs.

Results: We present a genome-wide search algorithm, called
MIReNA, that looks for miRNA sequences by exploring a
multidimensional space defined by only five (physical and
combinatorial) parameters characterizing acceptable pre-miRNAs.
MIReNA validates pre-miRNAs with high sensitivity and specificity,
and detects new miRNAs by homology from known miRNAs or from
deep sequencing data. A performance comparison between MIReNA
and four available predictive systems has been done. MIReNA
approach is strikingly simple but it turns out to be powerful at least as
much as more sophisticated algorithmic methods. MIReNA obtains
better results than three known algorithms that validate pre-miRNAs.
It demonstrates that machine-learning is not a necessary algorithmic
approach for pre-miRNAs computational validation. In particular,
machine learning algorithms can only confirm pre—miRNAs that look
alike known ones, this being a limitation while exploring species
with no known pre-miRNAs. The possibility to adapt the search to
specific species, possibly characterized by specific properties of their
miRNAs and pre-miRNAs, is a major feature of MIReNA. A parameter
adjustment calibrates specificity and sensitivity in MIReNA, a key
feature for predictive systems, which is not present in machine
learning approaches. Comparison of MIReNA with miRDeep using
deep sequencing data to predict miRNAs highlights a highly specific
predictive power of MIReNA.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a class of endogenes of 18—25 nt
in length and they occur in a precursor (pre—miRNA) with a

characteristic hairpin secondary structure. miRNAs are involved in
post-transcriptional regulation of protein-coding genes in animals
and plants by sequence complementarity Within the corresponding
messenger RNA. Since the discoveries of [in-4 and let-7 (Lee
et al., 1993; Pasquinelli et al., 2000) in Caenorhabditis elegans, the
number of miRNA/pre—miRNA pairs found in miRBase (Grifﬁths—
Jones, 2004; Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006), the reference database
collecting all known miRNAs from 115 species, has grown to more
than 10000 (11488 in version 14.0). Experimental identiﬁcation of
novel miRNAs is difﬁcult because they might be transcribed under
speciﬁc conditions and cell types. Only the half (6166 out of 11488)
of miRBase pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs have been experimentally
validated.

Several computational methods were developed to detect
miRNAs in genomes (see Tanzer et al., 2008, for a review).
A ﬁrst family of methods tests speciﬁc physical and geometrical
characteristics of the associated pre-miRNAs (Dezulian et al. , 2006;
Hertel et al., 2006; Legendre et al., 2005; Weber, 2005); these
properties concern the hairpin structure of sequences that are similar
to experimentally known pre-miRNA sequences. A second family is
constituted by de novo methods that use thermodynamic stability
of pre—miRNA hairpins and characteristic patterns of sequence
conservation (Hertel and Stadler, 2006; Lai et al., 2003; Lim et al.,
2003a; Wang et al., 2005) to predict pre—miRNAs. To conﬁrm pre—
miRNA sequences and their structures, tools that are based either
on machine—learning algorithms (Jiang et al., 2007; Sewer et al.,
2005; Xue et al., 2005) or on ranking euclidean distances in a
multidimensional space constructed from more than 30 parameters
(Xu et al., 2008) have been developed. A third approach to miRNA
prediction is based on deep sequencing data. A computational
tool, named miRDeep, predicting pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs by
combining experimental data to a Dicer processing model has been
introduced (Friedlander et al., 2008).

We propose a new tool, named MIReNA, designed for answering
several questions on miRNAs and pre-miRNAs. MIReNA searches
for miRNAs and pre-miRNAs at genome scale, and computationally
validates pre—miRNAs. It can be used in four different ways,
depending on available data: known miRNAs, deep sequencing
reads, potential miRNAs occurring in long sequences and putative
pre—miRNAs containing potential miRNAs. It has been compared
to four existing computational tools: MiPred (Jiang et al., 2007)
that classiﬁes sequences from real or pseudo pre—miRNAs by using
a random forest prediction model with combined features, miR-
abela (Sewer et al., 2005) that uses an ab initio approach to identify
clustered miRNAs based on the validation of pre-miRNAs by a

machine learning method, microPred (Batuwita and Palade, 2009), a
classiﬁer system for real and pseudo pre-miRNAs that uses machine
learning techniques, miRDeep (Friedlander et al. , 2008) that predicts
pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs from deep sequencing data.

2 THE ALGORITHM

MIReNA is a search algorithm, which is designed for the
prediction of miRNAs and pre-miRNAs. It can be used for
a genome-wide miRNA or pre-miRNA discovery. To identify
pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs, it explores a multidimensional space
deﬁned by only ﬁve (physical and combinatorial) parameters. These
parameters characterize suitable pre—miRNA structures and allow
the identiﬁcation of a strikingly simple set of conditions that
make MIReNA powerful at least as much as more sophisticated
computational methods, such as machine learning algorithms, used
to conﬁrm pre-miRNA sequences (Jiang et al., 2007; Sewer et al.,
2005 ; Xue et al., 2005).

2.1 Five numerical criteria to describe a pre-miRNA

We call miRNA* the complementary sequence r* (possibly
including unpaired nucleotides) of the miRNA r within a pre-
miRNA structure. Given a pre—miRNA sequence s, the adjusted
minimum folding energy (AMFE(s); Zhang et al., 2006) is computed

as M513“) >l< 100, where MFE(s) stands for the minimum free energy

of s (Delisi and Crothers, 1971; Tinoco et al., 1971) and l(s) is
the length, i.e. the number of nucleotides, of s. The minimum free

energy index (MFEI(s); Zhang et al., 2006) is computed as Aggy),
where %GC stands for the percentage of G+C composition of s.
A pre—miRNA secondary structure is deﬁned to satisfy ﬁve main
properties, the ﬁrst three ﬁxing the combinatorial structure of the

pre-miRNA and the last two its physico-chemical characteristics:

 

 

(I) a miRNA r cannot fold with itself within the pre-miRNA
secondary structure;

 

(II) the inequalities 0.83 5 11(5)) 5 1.17 hold. To compute the
thresholds, we considered the distance between r and r* to be
deﬁned as |l(r)—l(r*)|/l(r), where l(r),l(r*) are the lengths
of r, r*, respectively. A distance close to zero implies a strong
proximity of the sequences with a matching of essentially all
nucleotides in r, r*; larger distances imply a larger number of
unpaired nucleotides between the sequences. By analyzing the
distribution of distances between a miRNA and its miRNA*
on the testing set, we estimated an acceptable distance to be
< ,u +0, where ,u, a are mean and SD of the distribution. This
corresponds to deﬁne an interval of acceptable ratios to be
1— (,u+o) and 1+(,u+o), where a ratio = 1 corresponds to
a matching between sequences of the same length. The testing
set is deﬁned by the 6166 experimentally veriﬁed miRNAs
in miRBase (version 14.0, all 115 species confounded) from
which pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs with the miRNA folding
with itself or with the ratio l(r*)/l(r) > 3 were removed;

(III) the percentage p(r) of unmatched nucleotides in r within
the pre-miRNA secondary structure is 526% of l(r). This
threshold corresponds to ,u +0, where ,u, a are mean and SD
of the distribution of percentages computed on the testing set
in II.

(IV) the pre-miRNA sequence has AMFE 5 —32. This threshold
corresponds to ,u+o, where ,u,o are mean and SD of
the distribution of AMFE values computed on the set
of distinguished pre-miRNAs in miRBase containing an
experimentally veriﬁed miRNA. pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs
with the miRNA folding with itself or with the ratio
l(r*)/l(r) > 3 were removed from miRBase;

(V) the pre-miRNA sequence has MFEI < —0.85. This MFEI
criterion was used in (Zhang et al., 2006) to discriminate pre-
miRNAs from other RNA sequences with high speciﬁcity.
The threshold was found to sharply select only pre-miRNA
sequences out of coding and non-coding RNA sequences.

Criteria II and III ask r, r* to match almost completely: the lengths
of r and r* are comparable by II, and a high percentage of matched
nucleotides is demanded by III. The ﬁve numerical criteria are used
to identify suitable pre-miRNA structures. They allow us to consider
structures with multiple stems, which are not accepted as feasible by
many known approaches like MiPred for instance (Supplementary
Fig. 10 and d).

2.2 MIReNA algorithm

MIReNA can handle four kinds of data, is characterized by speciﬁc
pre-treatments of these data and predicts miRNAs and pre—miRNAs
after using Criteria I—V to ﬁlter the associated structures. It handles
known miRNAs, deep sequencing data, potential miRNAs occurring
in long sequences and putative pre-miRNAs containing potential
miRNAs. The ﬁrst two kinds of data are checked against full genome
sequences.

The ﬁrst kind of large scale analysis takes into account a set of
known miRNAs. Given a known miRNA, the algorithm searches for
highly similar sequences in a genome. The outcoming sequences are
potential miRNAs that are checked to have a suitable pre-miRNA
structure surrounding them. The black path in Figure 1 illustrates
the successive steps of the algorithm:

(1) it looks for sequences that are similar to the known miRNAs
by minimizing the number of insertions, deletions and
substitutions of nucleotides. Sequences obtained with this
search are considered as potential miRNAs. An approximate
string matching algorithm, i.e. an adaptation of (Myers, 1999),
extracts, for each genome position, the minimal (in length)
sufﬁx sequence of at most 25 nt in length that displays at most
15% of errors (by the Levenshtein distance; Levenshtein,
1966) with the original miRNA sequence;

(2

v

the resulting sequences are extended on the left and on the
right by 200 nt on each side;

(3) for each sequence extension obtained in Step 2, we compute
secondary structures of all subsequences containing the
potential miRNA. To produce secondary structures, we used
an adapted implementation of RNAfold (Hofacher et al.,
1994);

all structures obtained in Step 3 are scanned to ﬁlter out
those that do not satisfy numerical Criteria I—V above. The
remaining structures are considered as putative pre—miRNAs.
(Notice that the sequences that we retain are at least 60-nt
long.);

(4

v

(5) we consider all potential miRNAs that are included in putative
pre-miRNA sequences validated in Step 4. If two miRNAs
overlap, we keep the corresponding pre-miRNA that has the
best MFEI and discharge the most energetically unfavorable
one. If two miRNAs r1 and r2 are contained in pre-miRNAs
with the same MFEI and p(r1) < p(r2), we keep r1. If p(r1)=
p(r2) and l(rf)/l(r1) < l(r§)/l(r2), we keep r1. Otherwise, we
keep the pre-miRNA whose miRNA has maximum length;

(6) (this step is optional) the resulting pre-miRNAs are ﬁltered
and either repeated sequences (RepeatMasker is used for this),
or sequences that are not overlapping deep sequencing reads,
or sequences that are not overlapping expressed sequence tags
(ESTs) are discarded.

(7) (this step is optional) the resulting pre—miRNAs coming from
either Step 5 or 6 are ﬁltered using genomic information.
Pre—miRNAs overlapping CoDing Sequences (CDS), scRNA,
snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, rRNA and 21U-RNA sequences on
either strains are discarded.

The second kind of large scale analysis considers deep sequencing
data (red path in Fig. 1). Following the same approach introduced
in miRDeep (Friedlander et al., 2008), we map deep sequencing
reads on the genome and identify clustered regions of reads (at most
30 nt away) by discarding those which are >140 nt. Such sequences
are considered as putative pre—miRNAs and all reads contained
in them are taken as potential miRNAs. Secondary structures of
putative pre—miRNAs are constructed using RNAfold. Step 4 above
is run. It is followed by a step that ﬁlters precursors satisfying
a Dicer processing condition and at least one condition among
three concerning reads mapping the precursor. Among several
miRNAs within the same precursor, we select the one which is most
represented by reads. The screening based on genomic information
might also be run.

MIReNA can realize Step 4 alone to check whether a putative pre-
miRNA including a potential miRNA satisﬁes Criteria I—V (brown
path in Fig. 1). Finally, it can predict pre—miRNAs included in

sequences of about 400 nt in length by starting from a potential
miRNA in each sequence. This is done by running Steps 3 and 4
(blue path in Fig. 1).

3 RESULTS

MIReNA has been tested in several manners. To validate Criteria
I—V, we fully varied the corresponding thresholds, we evaluated
different combinations of these criteria and we compared I—V to
Minold criteria (Billoud et al., 2005). MIReNA performance in the
validation of pre-miRNAs (brown path in Fig. 1) has been evaluated
against three predictive systems, miR-abela, MiPred and microPred.
MIReNA predictive power on deep sequencing data (red path in
Fig. 1) was compared to miRDeep. MIReNA was used to predict
miRNAs and pre—miRNAs on six different species (black path in
Fig. 1) starting from known miRNAs in miRBase.

3.1 Validation of Criteria I—V

MIReNA has been validated on several datasets of known
pre-miRNA structures coming from the phylogenetically distant
genomes of Arabidopsis thaliana, C. elegans, Homo sapiens, 0ryza
sativa and Rattus norvegicus. To demonstrate that the method
conﬁrms sequences as pre-miRNAs and does it with good speciﬁcity
and sensitivity, we traced the receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) curves on the datasets for the ﬁve different species varying
systematically parameters. We studied ROC curves by varying all
ﬁve criteria (see Fig. 2a and c, and Supplementary Fig. 3a, 0, e,
g, i, k, m and o), by ﬁxing the combinatorial Criteria I—III and by
varying the physico-chemical Criteria IV and V (see Fig. 2b and d,
and Supplementary Fig. 3b, (1, f, h, j, l, n and p), and by varying
criteria I—III without considering Criteria IV and V (Supplementary
Fig. 5). When using one criteria at the time, Criteria V is the one

that provides best predictions and for this, we checked whether the
coupling with the other criteria could improve its strength or not
(see Fig. 2a and 0, Supplementary Fig. 3a, 0, e, g, i, k, m and 0 and
Supplementary Table 1).

For all species, we used single and multiple stems datasets.
MIReNA’s ROC curves show a successful discrimination of
real pre-miRNAs from pseudo ones on H.sapiens (Fig. 2a—d),
0.sativa, C.elegans, A.thaliana and R.norvegicus (Supplementary
Fig. 3). MIReNA’s ROC curves approximate well with the maximal
performance point [i.e. the top left corner in the plots, corresponding
to an ideal curve passing through it and characterizing 100% of
the area under the curve (AUC), or equivalently a 100% sensitivity
and 100% speciﬁcity] as shown in Supplementary Table 1, where
different numerical criteria provide a AUC >97% on all species.
AUC, accuracy (Acc) and Mathew’s correlation coefﬁcient (MCC)
values reported in Supplementary Table 1 correspond to the ROC
curve with best MCC value. These curves are plot in Figure 2a and
c and Supplementary Figure 3a, 0, e, g, i, k, m and 0.

By varying Criteria IV—V and letting ﬁxed I—III, we observe that
best ROC curves are comparable with those obtained by varying I—V
(see Fig. 2 and Supplementary Fig. 3). Essentially, the same AUC
values are obtained by different combinations of numerical criteria,
but slightly improved Acc and MCC values are identiﬁed when the
ﬁve criteria are considered all together, both for single and multiple
stems validation. We explicitly measured the predictive power of
Criteria V by ignoring the other criteria and letting V to vary. While
best AUC values are reached by considering V alone, best Acc and
MCC values are obtained with the combination of all criteria (see
Supplementary Table 1). As expected, by varying combinatorial
Criteria I—III and ignoring physico-chemical properties IV and
V, ROC curves show a much lower discrimination power (see
Supplementary Fig. 5).

MIReNA’s ROC curves are stable for a large interval of AMFE
values: curves computed for AMFE 3 —20 overlap each other and
for AMFE 5 —30 the signal starts to degrade with a loss of sensitivity
(and an improved speciﬁcity). This stability is an important feature
for a user since it simpliﬁes considerably parameterization. See
Figure 2b and d, and Supplementary Figure 3b, (1, f, h, j, l, n and p,
where the AUC of MIReNA’s ROC curves shows to be consistently
excellent, varying on a range between 96% and 100% for both single
and multiple stems predictions (Supplementary Table 1).

We tested whether Minold’s two criteria (Billoud et al., 2005),
which are close to our Criteria III, IV and V, could provide good
parameters to discriminate putative pre-miRNAs or not. Minold
takes an miRNA sequence and looks for two extensions, downstream
and upstream of the miRNA, having an optimal folding. Among all
different possible extensions, Minold selects the one that minimizes
a penalty score on miRNA/miRNA* matching and the MFE of
the secondary structure. The ﬁrst condition is an analog of our
combinatorial Criterion III, where we include a dependence on
the miRNA length though. The second condition is an analogue
of our physico-chemical Criteria IV and V where we take into
account the pre-miRNA length (IV) and the pre-miRNA GC—
composition (V). We computed ROC curves by varying the two
Minold’s criteria on the multiple stems positive and negative
datasets constructed on H.sapiens, 0.sativa, C.elegans, A.thaliana
and R.norvegicus. Results obtained with MIReNA and with Minold
criteria are very different (Supplementary Fig. 7). MIReNA ROC
curves upper bound ROC curves on Minold criteria in all datasets,

no use of Minold software was made but that only the two Minold
criteria were tested.

3.2 Comparison with other predictive tools

MIReNA has been compared to MiPred, microPred and miR-abela
on two distinct datasets. The ﬁrst dataset is the testing dataset used
in Jiang et al. (2007) from H.sapiens. It is composed by a positive
and a negative set of pre-miRNAs and pseudo pre—miRNAs where
miRNAs positions are not speciﬁed. For comparison, we do not
use any information coming from known miRNAs in miRBase, but
merely test MIReNA on the brown path in Figure 1. The second
dataset is composed by ﬁve negative and positive sets from ﬁve
different species (including sets for H.sapiens that are different
from the ones deﬁning the ﬁrst dataset). Positive sets have been
constructed from species-speciﬁc precursors in miRBase and the
negative ones from CDS sequences coming from the corresponding
genomes.

3.2.] Comparison with MiPred MiPred is a classiﬁer that
discriminates real single stem pre-miRNAs from pseudo ones (Jiang
et al., 2007). It is based on a Random Forest machine learning
method using more than 30 pre-miRNA features. On the ﬁrst dataset,
MiPred obtains better speciﬁcity results, while best sensitivity,
Acc and MCC are obtained by MIReNA (Table 1, top). On the

of new predicted precursors (7th) and number of new speciﬁc predicted precursors
(8th). An exact match with the miRNA in nlinase or with a read is required for the
results in the last three colurrms. Results were obtained by using thresholds on Criteria
I—V computed on the C. elegans and on the H.sapiens ROC curves (for multiple stems)
displaying best MCC (Fig. 2d and Supplementary Fig. 3p).

second dataset, MIReNA performs slightly better than MiPred for
all species when looking at A00 and MCC values (Table 1, bottom
and Supplementary Table 2, computed by varying Criteria I—V). In
conclusion, MIReNA obtains as good results as MiPred, or better,
and simpliﬁes in an essential manner the searching space, reducing
it to 5 parameters instead of 30. It can be applied to larger sets of
pre—miRNAs possibly presenting multiple stems.

3.2.2 Comparison with microPred microPred is a classiﬁer
system used to discriminate pre—miRNAs from other non—coding
RNAs by using machine learning techniques (Batuwita and Palade,
2009). The comparison between microPred and MIReNA has
been made on single and multiple stems datasets (Table 1
and Supplementary Table 2). MIReNA obtains a slightly lower
sensitivity but much higher speciﬁcity, Acc and MCC values than
microPred for four species. For A. thaliana, MIReNA outperforms
microPred.

3.2.3 Comparison with miR-abela miR-abela identiﬁes clustered
miRNAs by searching for pre—miRNAs (Sewer et al., 2005). It uses
a machine learning method to computationally validate the pre-
miRNAs. Sensitivity, Acc and MCC are higher for MIReNA on
both testing datasets (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2), with a
lower speciﬁcity, making MIReNA a better classiﬁer to discriminate
pre—miRNAs from pseudo ones.

3.3 miRNA discovery from deep sequencing data

MIReNA can be applied to deep sequencing datasets (red path
in Fig. 1). It has been compared to miRDeep on C.elegans and
H.sapiens deep sequencing data (Table 2). MIReNA provides a
slightly lower number of predictions with a lower sensitivity against
a higher signal—to-noise ratio than miRDeep. The two tools appear
complementary due to an important set of speciﬁc predictions
revealed on the analysis of both C. elegans and H.sapiens data.
This means that by running MIReNA one can recover a number
of miRNAs in miRBase, which have been missed by miRDeep and
viceversa. MIReNA predicts 5 (4 of which are MIReNA speciﬁc)

pre-miRNAs that do not contain known miRNAs in miRBase for
C. elegans and 63 (29 of which are MIReNA speciﬁc) for H. sapiens;
miRDeep predicts 1 (non-speciﬁc) pre-miRNA that does not contain
known miRNAs in miRBase for C.elegans and 64 (30 of which are
miRDeep speciﬁc) for H.sapiens.

Deep sequencing data are used twice in the red path of Figure 1.
The ﬁrst time to select clusters of reads providing precursors as done
in Friedlander et al. (2008). The second time when ﬁltering pre-
miRNA/miRNA pairs that respect the Dicer processing. Intuitively,
given a pre-miRNA/miRNA pair, we expect reads to overlap the
miRNA, the miRNA* and the remaining hairpin loop (i.e. the
sequence between the end of the miRNA and the beginning of the
miRNA*) without having too many reads overlapping two of these
regions. This idea is present in Friedlander et al. (2008).

A main difference between MIReNA and miRDeep is the selection
of the potential miRNA at the beginning of the algorithm (second
box in red path of Fig. 1) that for MIReNA is less restrictive. We
accept pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs where each miRNA matches a read
in the dataset, while miRDeep only considers those pairs where
the miRNA is most represented by reads matching the pre-miRNA.
This means that for the same pre—miRNA, MIReNA may consider
several pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs satisfying Criteria I—V, whereas
miRDeep considers only one pair. However, notice that our Criteria
I—III (depending on the length of the miRNA) turn out to be more
restrictive than those used by miRDeep (based on ﬁxed thresholds)
to accept a miRNA in a pre—miRNA.

Another main difference between MIReNA and miRDeep is in
the second ﬁltering step of MIReNA (fourth box in red path of
Fig. 1). MIReNA considers the same ideas used in miRDeep but
encodes them in a set of combinatorial rules instead of deﬁning a
probabilistic model.

3.4 Predictive miRNA analysis with MIReNA

MIReNA has been applied to discover miRNAs and pre—miRNAs in
species already known to contain miRNAs and in species where
their existence could be veriﬁed experimentally after prediction.
An exploratory analysis was done on six eukaryotic species. Two
of them, A. thaliana and C.elegans, are multicellular and contain
experimentally known miRNAs. The remaining four, the two
diatoms Thalassiosira pseudonana and Phaeodactylam tricornatam,
and the two yeasts S chizosaccharomyces pombe and Saccharomyces
cerevisiae, are unicellular organisms not known to contain any
miRNA.

Based on miRBase, a dataset of known miRNAs from
multicellular species, MIReNA predicts similar miRNA sequences
whose associated pre-miRNA structures satisfy necessary structural
conditions and whose pre-miRNA sequences are required
not to have low complexity (by RepeatMasker). Secondary
structures of predicted pre-miRNAs might display multiple stems
(Supplementary Fig. 10 and d).

MIReNA ﬁnds potential miRNAs for all six studied organisms
(Table 3, 3rd column). When considering EST data, all species
contain potential miRNAs whose pre-miRNA sequences match
some EST (Boguski et al. , 1993) with the exception of yeast species
having no EST match lying in intergenic regions (Table 3). Among
the 1842 (respectively 621) predicted pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs of
C. elegans (respectively A.thaliana), 1392 (respectively 370) are
similar in sequence to known miRNAs whose hairpin sequences

MIReNA identiﬁcation of pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs with miRNA sequences similar
(but not necessarily identical) to miRNAs in miRBase. The number of known pre-
miRNAs belonging to miRBase is given after the species name. The number of pre-
miRNA/miRNA pairs that do not overlap CDS, scRNA, snRNA, snoRNA, tRNA, rRNA
and 21U-RNA sequences on either strands is reported (2nd column; all columns named
‘ﬁlter’ identify a screening based on genomic information). For T. pseudonana and
P. tricomutum, we check overlapping with CDSs (the only information available). A
second ﬁlter of all pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs is realized with RepeatMasker (3rd), EST
sequences (4th) and deep sequencing data (6th) and validation of putative pre-miRNAs
is done by matching an EST to the pre-miRNA or a read to the miRNA. A number of
new pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs, not contained in miRBase, are predicted from ESTs or
deep sequencing data after ﬁltering (‘new’).

are not classiﬁed within the family classiﬁcation of miRBase.
Of these 1392 (respectively 370) sequences, 718 (respectively 119)
are similar to already known miRNAs from C. elegans (respectively
A.thaliana). This means that there exists a large number of miRNA
paralogs whose hairpin sequences have not been yet classiﬁed within
miRBase.

Multicellular species contain potential miRNAs that match deep
sequencing reads. MIReNA highlights that new expressed pre-
miRNAs may exist (Table 3, 5th and 7th columns). The associated
miRNAs are similar and not necessarily identical to known miRNAs
in miRBase (possibly identiﬁed for other species). This pool of
pre-miRNA/miRNA constitutes a set of new predictions, since the
miRNA is not a known miRNA for the species.

4 METHODS

4.1 Genomic data and datasets

Genomes ﬂat ﬁles for A.thaliana, S.cerevisiae, S.pombe, H.sapiens,
R.norvegicus and 0.sativa were retrieved from the NCBI site
http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/, for C.elegans from the WormBase
site http://www.wormbase.org, for Rtricornutum and Tpseudonana from
the JGI site http://genome.jgi-psf.org. The corresponding assembling
versions are listed in Supplementary Table 3. Known miRNA sequences
and their genome location were downloaded from version 14.0 of miRBase
(http://microrna.sanger.ac.uk/sequences/ftp.shtml).

miRBase (Grifﬁths-J ones, 2004; Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006) was used as
a reference dataset to deﬁne thresholds and to construct testing sets of pre-
miRNA/miRNA pairs. It declares a miRNA to be experimentally validated
or computationally predicted by coupling it with a speciﬁc pre—miRNA.
In miRBase, there are miRNAs within a species that have been validated

for several different pre-miRNAs, and there are several pre-miRNAs that
validate several miRNAs contained in their sequence. Out of this list of
11488 miRNA/pre-miRNA pairs, 6166 concern experimentally validated
miRNAs and 5322 concern computationally predicted miRNAs. Among
the 6166 experimentally validated pairs, 5471 present different pre-miRNA
sequences; among the 5322 computationally predicted pairs, 4406 have
different pre-miRNA sequences.

Thresholds in MIReNA were computed using experimentally validated
pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs in miRBase only.

We constructed several datasets on the ﬁve species H. sapiens, A. thaliana,
C.elegans, 0.sativa and R.norvegicus following the generation method
proposed in Xue et al. (2005). The ﬁve datasets have been used to compare
MIReNA to available tools (Table 1 and Supplementary Table 2). Each
dataset is constituted by two sets of sequences, a positive one, made
of experimentally validated and computationally predicted pre-miRNA
sequences in miRBase, and a negative one, made from coding sequences,
that is extracted from concatenated CDS of the corresponding species.
Positive and negative sets are composed of pre-miRNAs and pre-miRNAs-
like sequences, i.e. sequences validating four conditions on: (i) sequence
length; (ii) minimum number of basis paired on the stem of the hairpin
structure; (iii) MFE of the sequence structure; and (iv) hairpin structure, made
of a single stem. These four conditions have been previously used in MiPred.
Sets contain from a minimum of 71 to a maximum of 660 hairpin structures
characterized by a single stem. Positive and negative datasets are referred
to as ‘single stem datasets’ in the text. We were interested to study hairpin
structures with several stems too and generated for each species negative
datasets accepting hairpins, following the same generation approach as in
Xue et al. (2005). Corresponding positive datasets contain all known pre-
miRNAs (from 173 to 717), for the considered species, in miRBase, and
no ﬁltering with conditions (i—iv) above has been applied. We refer to these
positive and negative datasets as ‘multiple stems datasets’.

The testing dataset described in Jiang et al. (2007) was used to compute
Table 1 (top): 263 positive sequences are human miRNAs and 265 negatives
are issued from CDS sequences as described above.

4.2 ROC curves

ROC curves are plot on datasets from ﬁve species by varying values
of MIReNA parameters and Minold criteria. MIReNA’s pre-miRNAs
validations from the datasets were computed using the ﬁve criteria introduced
above. As no potential miRNA is determined for pre-miRNAs in the datasets,
we say that a pre-miRNA validates Criteria I, II and 111 if it includes a
subsequence (i.e. a potential miRNA) of 18—25 nt in length that ensures
the corresponding thresholds. MIReNA’s ROC curves were computed for
different combinations of Criteria I—V. Also, ROC curves have been plot
based on Minold two criteria: a penalty score counting the number of
mismatches between miRNA and miRNA*, and the MFE.

4.3 Computational tools used for comparison

MIReNA was compared to different existing tools. MiPred (Jiang et al.,
2007) implementation was provided to us by the authors (personal
communication). We used miR-abela (with default parameters) at
http://www.mirz.unibas.ch/cgi/pred_miRNA_genes.cgi, microPred at
http://www.comlab.ox.ac.uk/microPred/microPred-server.html. miRDeep
was downloaded at http://www.mdc-berlin.de/en/research/research_teams/
systems_bi0logy_of_gene_regulatory_elements/projects/miRDeep/

4.4 Computational tools used for MIReNA

The computation of secondary structures is realized with the RNAfold
program of the Vienna RNA package (Hofacher et al., 1994) by minimizing
the free energy of the structure. We modiﬁed the source code of RNAfold to
avoid the sequential computation of all possible subsequences, and directly
compute the secondary structure of the whole sequence and retrieve the
minimum free energy structure of all sub-sequences of it by backtracking.

This adaption of the code concerns Step 4 in the algorithm (Fig. 1).
RNAfold is found at http://www.tbi.univie.ac.at/RNA/. Default parameters
of RNAfold were used.

RepeatMasker [A.F.A.Smit et al. (2009) RepeatMasker unpublished data]
has been used as a ﬁlter to remove sequences containing repeats. We
used version open-3.2.8 with RMLib: 20090604 (http://www.repeatmasker
.org/cgi-bin/WEBRepeatMasker) and crossmatch as search engine with a
slow speed. Repeat sequences used by RepeatMasker are stored in the
Repbase database (Jurka et al., 2005).

4.5 Deep sequencing data and their mapping

The two sets of reads used to compare MIReNA and miRDeep are constructed
following Friedlander et al. (2008). The ﬁrst puts together two 454 deep
sequencing C.elegans datasets of GEO database at NCBI, and the second
puts together two Solexa and one 454 deep sequencing H. sapiens datasets of
GEO database at NCBI (see Supplementary Table 4 for accession numbers).
Putative pre-miRNAs were constructed by using scripts from Friedlander
et al. (2008) realizing the excision of clusters of reads. To compute sensitivity
of the two systems, we considered miRNAs in miRBase version 14.0.
This version of miRBase contains 13 C.elegans and 9 H.sapiens miRNAs
predicted by miRDeep in Friedlander et al. (2008), which were not contained
in miRBase version 10.0 used in Friedlander et al. (2008). Sensitivity is
computed as the ratio between the number of species-speciﬁc miRNAs
of miRBase contained in predicted precursors and the number of species-
speciﬁc miRNAs in miRBase matching deep sequencing reads (a match
allows for mismatching in the last three nucleotides of miRNAs). Speciﬁcity
cannot be directly computed because of the impossibility to directly evaluate
false positives. This value can be estimated, following Friedlander et al.
(2008), by generating a set of pre-miRNAs together with positions of mapped
reads. To do so, we start from the set of putative pre-miRNAs where positions
of mapped reads are identiﬁed and shufﬂe the association between the set of
pre-miRNAs and the set of conﬁgurations of read positions. We obtain a set
of negative pre-miRNAs on which the algorithm is tested and the number of
false positives is computed. This is done 100 times and a distribution of the
number of false positives is considered. The signal-to-noise ratio is N / ,an : 1
where an is the mean of the distribution and N the number of predictions
obtained with MIReNA or miRDeep.

The mapping of a read is done asking for 100% of identity over the full
length of the read, for all deep sequencing datasets, using megablast (with
options —W12 —plOO). A read is considered only when it perfectly maps
5 5 locations in the genome. The only exception is done with the H. sapiens
dataset GSE10829 due to our comparison with miRDeep: given a read, a
mapping of the read to possibly several sites in the genome, is constructed
by asking that the ﬁrst 18 nucleotides of the read perfectly align with the
genomic sequence and by extending the alignment on the 3’-end until the
ﬁrst mismatch is found. Accepted matches are those with maximal length.
There might be several of them and reads with more than ﬁve matches are
discarded.

The red path in the algorithm asks for a ﬁltering step for precursors that is
based on a Dicer processing condition. Following Friedlander et al. (2008),
we deﬁne a Dicer processing signature for a pre-miRNA/miRNA pair to be
as follows: a read has to map with the potential miRNA of the pair, or its
corresponding miRNA* or the remaining hairpin loop. The alignment can
extend the miRNA or the miRNA* on the 5’-end by at most 2m and the
3’-end by at most 5 nt. Among the reads mapping the precursor, we ask at
least the 90% of them to satisfy the signature.

Pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs satisfying the Dicer processing condition
should also satisfy at least one of the following conditions: (i) the miRNA*
is mapped by a read where the alignment can extend the miRNA* on the
5’ -end by at most 1 nt and the 3’-end by at most 5 nt; (ii) the miRNA sequence
should be matched by at least two reads (where the alignment can extend
the miRNA on the 5’-end by at most 2 nt and the 3’-end by at most 5 nt) and
within nucleotide 2—8 from the 5’-end should match nucleotides 2—8 of a
known miRNA in miRBase (miRNAs for metazoan are considered with the

exception of the species under consideration); (iii) the different pre-miRNA
subsequences mapped by reads that satisfy the Dicer processing condition
should be at least 3 (4) for C.elegans (H.sapiens). The threshold 3 (4) has
been statistically evaluated by mapping reads on the C.elegans (H. sapiens)
pre—miRNAs in miRBase, by retaining only those pre-miRNAs that do not
satisfy conditions (i) and (ii), and by computing the mean of the number of
different pre-miRNA subsequences mapped by reads that satisfy the Dicer
processing condition. Conditions (i—iii) are inspired by the criteria used in
Friedlander et al. (2008) to deﬁne a probabilistic scoring.

In Table 3, to ﬁlter MIReNA miRNA predictions we used deep sequencing
data (see Supplementary Table 4 for GEO accession numbers).

4.6 Pre-miRNAs ﬁltering using ESTs or reads

In columns 4—5 of Table 3, we ﬁltered MIReNA predicted pre-miRNA
sequences against the EST database dbEST of the studied species (Boguski
et al., 1993) by using BLAST (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/) with default
parameters: a pre-miRNA sequence matches an EST when at least 80%
of similarity on at least 80% of the sequence with an e-value <=1e‘30
are present. In columns 6—7 of Table 3, miRNA predictions from deep
sequencing data are obtained starting from pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs where
the miRNA is similar to a known miRNA in miRBase, and by ﬁltering out
those miRNAs that do not match a read. For the matching of the read, we
ask for 100% identity on the miRNA length.

4.7 Prediction system assessment

To properly evaluate MIReNA performance, we rely on the following
quantities: the number of known pre-miRNAs correctly predicted (true
positives, TP), the number of pseudo pre-miRNAs correctly predicted (true
negatives, TN), the number of pseudo pre-miRNAs incorrectly predicted as
pre—miRNAs (false positives, FP) and the number of known pre-miRNAs
incorrectly predicted as pseudo pre-miRNAs (false negatives, FN). We

use four standard measures of performance: Speciﬁcity (Spe: MAW),
Sensitivity (Sen = %1 ACC (Acc = ﬂ) and MCC (MCC =

TPXTN—FPXFN

¢(TP+FP)x(TN+FN)X(TP+FN)X(TN+FP)) (Matthews, 1975).

4.8 Implementation
MIReNA package is written in bash, C, perl, python, and it is

available at http://www.ihes.fr/”carbone/data8/. Parameters are described in
Supplementary Material and in the help ﬁle by typing ‘./MIReNA.sh -h’.

5 DISCUSSION

MIReNA is a platform that helps to test new hypothesis on miRNAs
and pre—miRNA structures. Across organisms, it might be that the
characteristic length of miRNA sequences might vary slightly and a
tool like MIReNA, allowing for length calibration, can help in silico
investigation of the existence of miRNA sequences with non-
standard properties. Similar considerations might be extended to
unusual characteristics of pre-miRNA structures as hairpin multiple
branching, contrary to what has been usually assumed (Lim et al.,
2003a, b; Nelson et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005). Experimentally
validated multiple branched pre-miRNAs exist (Supplementary
Fig. lo) and in miRBase, they constitute the 10% (671 over 6166)
of experimentally validated pre—miRNAs. Many other properties of
miRNAs and pre—miRNAs can be ﬁne—tuned in MIReNA giving the
opportunity to the biologist to perform an in silico identiﬁcation
of miRNA sequences (possibly with non-standard features) in
experimentally unexplored genomes.

MIReNA does not search for structurally similar pre-miRNAs.
In consequence, its results are different from those obtained by most

methods (Dezulian et al., 2006; Hertel et al., 2006; Legendre et al.,
2005), and in particular from those based on secondary structure
conservation (Lim et al., 2003a; Wang et al., 2005). One should
expect MIReNA to detect pre-miRNAs that cannot be predicted
by other approaches. (See miRscan; Lim et al., 2003a, analysis in
Supplementary Material.)

MIReNA handles experimental data and can check the
compatibility of its predictions against EST data and deep
sequencing data. Deep sequencing data can be used in two distinct
manners. MIReNA can check either that predictions from miRNAs
in miRBase are matched by reads, or it can directly employ reads to
predict pre-miRNA/miRNA pairs, as previously done in miRDeep.
MIReNA and miRDeep provide a large core of common predictions
but also speciﬁc ones. MIReNA appears to have a signal-to-noise
ratio higher than miRDeep and its speciﬁc predictions highly support
experimental validation.

The exploratory analysis done on six eukaryotic species highlights
the existence of pre—miRNA/miRNA pairs for all species when a
purely genomic prediction ﬁltered with RepeatMasker is realized
(Table 3, 3rd column). On the other hand, when ESTs are taken
into account, miRNAs are predicted only for multicellular species
and for diatoms (Table 3, 4th column). The number of pre—
miRNA/miRNA pairs is much smaller for unicellular species than
for multicellular ones, and this difference is consistent with the
observed correlation between expansion of sets of miRNAs and
morphological complexity of the organisms (Heimberg et al., 2008;
Lee et al., 2007; Niwa and Slack, 2007; Sempere et al., 2006;
Wheeler et al., 2009).

The few miRNAs found for diatoms suggest diatoms miRNAs to
have speciﬁc characteristics and be different from those observed up
to now, their detection demanding different parameterizations. The
existence of RNA interference (RNAi) in diatoms has been indirectly
proven by using a putative silencing machinery; several enzymes
have been proposed to participate in silencing but the identiﬁcation
of miRNAs is still undergoing (De Riso et al., 2009).

MIReNA found no pre—miRNA in yeasts (after ﬁltering with EST
data) in agreement with the absence of RNAi machinery. miRNAs
have never been reported for fungi and are absent in S. pombe, which
has known RNA silencing mechanisms (Cerutti and Casa—Mollano,
2006; Hertel et al., 2006). The gene silencing pathway of RNAi
was estimated to have recently being lost in S.cerevisiae, where
reintroducing Dicer and argonaute restores RNAi (Drinnenberg
et al., 2009). The ﬁnding of eight potential miRNAs in S. cerevisiae
from genomic analysis (Table 3, 3rd column) is not in contradiction
with the loss of the RNAi machinery but might suggest the existence
of an ongoing process of hairpin deletion.

EST sequences and deep sequencing data depend on speciﬁc
experimental conditions and pre-miRNAs predictions ﬁltered or
computed from these data capture only partially miRNAs expressed
in the cell. Their exploration allows us to predict new miRNAs
(Tables 2 and 3) though and parameterizable tools like MIReNA
open a way to miRNA discovery in organisms where miRNA
characteristics are yet unknown.

MIReNA answers to several questions addressed by available
tools, it performs at least as well as these tools and in most cases
better than those, displaying very good sensitivity, speciﬁcity and
A00. The biologist can use it as a platform to check several questions
around miRNAs and pre-miRNAs prediction starting from different
kinds of available information (computationally and experimentally

validated miRNAs, or deep sequencing data) and can play with
sensitivity and speciﬁcity by using parameters variability.

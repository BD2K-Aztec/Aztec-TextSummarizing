Abstract

Motivation: Circular permutation is an important type of protein rearrangement. Natural circular
permutations have implications for protein function, stability and evolution. Artificial circular per—
mutations have also been used for protein studies. However, such relationships are difficult to
detect for many sequence and structure comparison algorithms and require special consideration.
Results: We developed a new algorithm, called Combinatorial Extension for Circular Permutations
(CE—CP), which allows the structural comparison of circularly permuted proteins. CE—CP was de—
signed to be user friendly and is integrated into the RCSB Protein Data Bank. It was tested on two
collections of circularly permuted proteins. Pairwise alignments can be visualized both in a desktop
application or on the web using Jmol and exported to other programs in a variety of formats.
Availability and implementation: The CE—CP algorithm can be accessed through the RCSB website
at http://WV\AN.rcsb.org/pdb/workbench/workbench.do. Source code is available under the LGPL 2.1

1 Introduction

Circular permutation describes a relationship between two proteins
where the N—terminal portion of one protein is related to the C—
terminal portion of the other. While the order of amino acids changes,
circularly permuted proteins are generally found to assume the same
structure. Circular permutation has been documented to naturally
occur in a number of protein families, such as lectins (Cunningham
et 61]., 1979) and DNA methyltransferases (Jeltsch, 1999). Two general
mechanisms for the evolution of circularly permuted proteins are
known, so detecting such events can shed light on the evolutionary his—
tory of protein families (Weiner and Bornberg—Bauer, 2006). Circular
permutation can inﬂuence protein folding, dynamics and function
(Bliven and Prlic, 2012). Synthetic circular permutants have been en—
gineered to alter activity, control regulation and improve stability
(Ostermeier, 2005 ; Whitehead et 61]., 2009; Yu and Lutz, 2011).

Natural circular permutants generally have quite low sequence
similarity, with previous studies finding <0.3—2.6% of proteins
share >30% identity (Jung and Lee, 2001; Lo and Lyu, 2008).
Thus, including structural information is essential for detecting
circular permutations. Many structural alignment algorithms are
unable to detect rearrangements in sequence, while general se—
quence—order independent methods lack a clear evolutionary
mechanism by which complex rearrangements could occur.
Therefore, algorithms that specifically search for circular permuta—
tions are needed. Several existing algorithms have been reported,
including SHEBA (Jung and Lee, 2001) and CPSARST (Lo and
Lyu, 2008).

Here we describe a method, Combinatorial Extension with
Circular Permutations (CE—CP), for the identification of circular per-
mutations based on protein structure.

Detection of circular permutations 1317
2 MGthOdS _ Eh] "imb-

CE is a rigid—body structural comparison algorithm (Shindyalov and . \
Bourne, 1998). It uses dynamic programming to identify regions of i g *-.
local similarity between the alpha carbons of two protein structures, ,- . 1' \

followed by iterative refinement to find a global superposition with
low RMSD and high number of aligned residues.

To adapt CE to quickly find circular permutations, we use an
algorithm analogous to that proposed by Uliel et al. (1999) for
detecting circular permutations by sequence similarity. The atoms of
the shorter structure are virtually duplicated. This allows the align-
ment of the first protein to wrap around from the carboxyl terminus
to the amino terminus of the second protein (see Fig. 1b). Thus, the
path with optimal structural similarity will contain some residues
from each copy of the duplicated protein, allowing the permutation
site to be identified. In the case of structures that are not circular
permuted, two equivalent paths are possible.

After identifying the highest scoring alignment to the duplicated
protein, the result is processed to map the alignment onto the ori—
ginal query. While this is generally unambiguous for high-scoring
alignments, it is possible that a single residue in the duplicated pro—
tein will align to multiple residues. In this case, a single aligned resi—
due is chosen such that the total alignment length is maximized.

This technique is agnostic to the details of the actual alignment
algorithm. Thus, it could be easily adapted to allow other sequence—
order dependent alignment algorithms to detect circular permuta—
tions. For instance, CE—CP was used in our recent tool CE—Symm for
identifying internally symmetric structures (Myers—Turnbull et 61].,
2014)

To reduce computational time, CE by default limits gap sizes to
30 residues. As terminal insertions are common in protein struc-
tures, due to both biological variability in tail regions and experi-
mental tags and artifacts, this limit is often restrictive for circularly
permuted proteins, and all gaps are considered used in CE—CP by de—
fault. This ensures that the optimal path can be found regardless of
insertions and deletions.

3 Results and discussion

CE—CP is integrated into the RCSB PDB Comparison Tool, along
with several other algorithms for structural alignment (Prlic et 61].,
2010). Two user interfaces are available: a web version, and a stand—
alone Java application that can be downloaded or run via Java Web
Start.

CE—CP results are presented to the user graphically, using the
Jmol visualization program, and as a pairwise alignment. The por—
tions before and after the permutation site are displayed in different
colors if a permutation is found. The alignment is also available for
export in a variety of formats, including a parsable text format or a
two-model PDB file containing the two superimposed structures.
The standalone application provides additional features, such as the
ability to compare custom PDB files and perform full database
searches.

As shown in Figure 1, CE—CP is able to identify the conserved
structural core between highly divergent structures. It is robust to in—
sertions and deletions, making it suitable for the detection of circular
permutations in multi—domain structures.

No large, balanced benchmarks of circularly permuted structures
are available. However, CE—CP performance was evaluated on the
small but accurate RIPC benchmark (Mayr et 61]., 2007), as well as
compared to results from the semi—automated circular permutation
database (CPDB) (Lo et 61]., 2009).

The RIPC dataset is a small benchmark of ‘challenging’ manual
alignments, due to the presence of insertions, conformational vari-
ability and permutations. All 11 pairs of circularly permuted pro—
teins from the dataset were correctly identified by CE—CP, with most
residues matching the reference alignment within 0—4 residues.

The CPDB contains 4169 pairs of circularly permuted proteins,
as identified by the CPSARST algorithm, followed by manual
screening for false positives. Thus, entries contain a plausible circu—
lar permutation but are not verified as evolutionarily related. CE—CP
identified a circular permutation in 3666 (88%) of CPDB pairs. Of
the cases where a permutation was not detected, many are internally
pseudosymmetric structures that have reasonable sequential align—
ments. As both circularly permuted proteins and internally symmet-
ric proteins can evolve through duplication and fusion mechanisms,
the high correlation between the two phenomena should be unsur—
prising. A portion of these symmetric cases may prove to be false
positives from CPSARST given additional evolutionary or functional
data.

CE—CP is a readily available and easy to use tool for detecting cir—
cular permutations from protein structures. It is incorporated into
the RCSB PDB Comparison Tool, which allows the comparison of
structures through a variety of methods both on the RCSB PDB web—
site and via a Java Webstart executable. CE—CP is available as part
of the BioJava open source project (Prlic et 61]., 2012).

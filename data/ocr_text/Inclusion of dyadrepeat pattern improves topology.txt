Abstract

Summary: Accurate topology prediction of transmembrane [i-barrels is still an open question.
Here, we present BOCTOPUSZ, an improved topology prediction method for transmembrane
[i—barrels that can also identify the barrel domain, predict the topology and identify the orientation
of residues in transmembrane [i-strands. The major novelty of BOCTOPUSZ is the use of the
dyad-repeat pattern of lipid and pore facing residues observed in transmembrane [i—barrels. In a
cross-validation test on a benchmark set of 42 proteins, BOCTOPUSZ predicts the correct topology
in 69% of the proteins, an improvement of more than 10% over the best earlier method
(BOCTOPUS) and in addition, it produces significantly fewer erroneous predictions on non-

transmembrane [i—barrel proteins.

1 Introduction

Transmembrane ﬁ-barrels (TMBs) are located in the outer membranes
of bacteria, chloroplasts and mitochondria and are involved in trans-
port of substrates across the cell membrane. Also, they are key com-
ponents of translocation complexes. Bacterial TMBs consist of an
even number of anti-parallel ﬁ-strands that are surrounded by long
outer-loops and short inner-loops. Eukaryotic TMBs can have an odd
number of strands. The residues located in transmembrane ﬁ-strands
follow a dyad-repeat pattern, where alternating residues face the lipids
and the pore region (Wimley, 2003), respectively. BOCTOPUS
(Hayat and Elofsson, 2012), a previously published two-stage TMB
topology predictor, did not predict the lipid/pore-facing orientation of
residues in the transmembrane ﬁ-strands but BOCTOPUSZ does. The
use of this information improves topology predictions.

2 Methods

Forty-two TMB sequences, culled at 20% sequence identity using the
PISCES server (Wang and Dunbrack, 2005) are divided into 10 sub-
sets for cross-validation (Supplementary Table 51). To ensure that no
homology information is used, all proteins from the same super-fam-
ily are put into the same cross-validation group. Membrane bounda-
ries, 3D structures and super-family classification are obtained from
the OPM database (Lomize et al., 2006). Residues in the transmem-
brane strands are labelled as pore or lipid-facing based on their side-
chain orientation relative to the barrel center. In addition, a dataset
(also reduced to 20% sequence identity) consisting of 370 (28 eukary-
otic and 342 prokaryotic) known TMBs and 7558 non-TMBs that
contain a signal peptide was downloaded from Uniprot (Consortium
et al., 2015).

BOCTOPUS2 consists of three layers (Fig. 1): First, the prefer-
ences and the class-probability for each residue to be in each state
(i.e. outer-loop (o), inner-loop (i), pore-facing (p) or lipid-facing (l)
ﬁ-strand region) are predicted using a Support Vector Machine
(SVM). Secondly a filter is applied to detect the barrel region. These
class-probabilities are used to create a (L X 4) protein profile, where
L is the number of residues in the input protein sequence. We then
apply a filter to estimate the barrel region. In this step, we use the
sum of values for the in-facing and out-facing classes over a window
of 100 residues centered at the residue in question to predict the bar-
rel region. The region where this sum is 20.3 is considered the barrel
region. Residues outside this region are considered to be in the non-
barrel region and all lipid-facing (l) and pore-facing (p) probability
values in that region are set to 0 and all inner-loop (i) values are set
to 1, so as to suppress a false transmembrane beta-strand prediction.
In the final step, the updated protein profile obtained after applying
the filter is used as the input to a Hidden Markov-like Model to pre-
dict the final global topology.

The advantage of this architecture is twofold; the SVM can use a
window of residues to estimate the localization of a single residue,
and the Hidden Markov Model does not require training as all transi-
tion probabilities can be set to 1. This is in contrast to BOCTOPUS
where parameters had to be optimized. For each protein, a multiple
sequence alignment is generated using 4 iterations of HHblits against
Uniprot20 database (Remmert et al., 2011). Sequences with more
than 60% gaps are filtered out. A position specific substitution matrix
(PSSM) is then generated using blastpgp (Altschul et al., 1997) and
used as input to the next step. Optimal results were obtained using
window sizes of 9, 13, 23 and 31 residues for predicting lipid-facing,
pore-facing, inner and outer loops, respectively.

2.1 Filter for detecting non-TMB regions

Some TMBs contain long non-barrel regions and sporadic strand
predictions can occur in these proteins causing errors in topology
predictions. Earlier methods have often been trained on PDB
sequences that exclude these regions making these methods less
suitable for large-scale predictions. Here, we use the observation
that ﬁ-strands incorrectly predicted in the non-barrel region are dis-
tantly separated from each other. A running average of the l and p

Fig. 1. BOCTOPUSZ pipeline — HHblits is used to obtain a position specific
scoring matrix (PSSM), 4 SVMs are used to predict the location of each
residue. A per-residue profile is constructed by combining the output proba-
bilities of SVMs. Then a filter is applied to detect the likely transmembrane
ﬂ-barrel region. The resulting per-residue profile is used as an input to a
Hidden Markov Model to predict the topology

probabilities (Fig. 1) over a window size of 100 is summed and an
empirical threshold value of 20.3 is used to identify the transmem-
brane barrel region.

2.2 HMM-architecture

The HMM consists of states for inner- and outer-loops, and lipid-
and pore-facing membrane strand residues. The architecture initially
used in BOCTOPUS is simplified to reduce the number of param-
eters (Supplementary Fig. 51). The number of residues in a ﬁ-strand
can be either 9 or 11. HMM parameters are independent of the
dataset as all transition and emission probabilities in a given state
are set to 1. The Viterbi algorithm is subsequently used to find the
optimal topology.

3 Results

BOCTOPUS2 predicts the correct topology for 29 proteins out of 42
(69%) proteins (Table 1). This is better than other methods and, in
addition, the performances of all earlier methods are possibly over-
estimated as some of the 42 proteins have been used in their training
sets (Supplementary Information). One main reason for the im-
proved results is that the filter in BOCTOPUS2 avoids incorrect pre-
diction of strands in the non-barrel region. This filter also aids
discrimination between TMBs and non-TMBs. In a dataset of 755 8
non-TMBs and 370 TMBs BOCTOPUS2 (Freeman and Wimley,
2010) predicts three or more strands in 81 % of the TMBs at a speci-
ficity of 98.9% (Supplementary Table 52). Amongst the methods
tested here, only HHomp (Remmert et al., 2009) and BETAWARE
have a higher Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) for barrel/
non-barrel discrimination (Supplementary Table 52). The detection
of eukaryotic TMBs seems to be more difficult as BOCTOPUS2
only detects 10 out of 28, possibly due to different evolutionary ori-
gins (Supplementary Table 52).

Comparison of topology prediction methods. Topology - Number of pro-
teins with the correct topology. TM — Number of proteins with correct num-
ber of predicted strands. SOV is the segment overlap (Rost et al., 1994), Q2 is
the two-state (membrane/not-membrane) prediction accuracy and Q3 is the
three-state (membrane, inner-loop, outer-loop) prediction accuracy. Q4, the
four state (lipid-facing, pore-facing, inner-loop, outer-loop) accuracy for
BOCTOPUSZ is 89. BOCTOPUSZ results are cross-validated while all other
methods have included some of the 42 proteins in their training set. The two
last columns TPR and FPR describe the true and false positive rate in the dis-
crimination dataset. BOCTOPUS (Hayat and Elofsson, 2012), profT MB
(Bigelow and Rost, 2006), PRED-TMBB (Bagos et al., 2004), BETAWARE
(Savojardo et al., 2013), HHomp (Remmert et al., 2009) and F-W ﬁ-barrel
Analyzer (Freeman and Wimley, 2010) results were obtained using standalone
versions.

4 Conclusions

We present BOCTOPUS2, an improved topology predictor for
TMBs that exploits the dyad-repeat feature of bacterial TMBs to
identify transmembrane ﬁ-strands. BOCTOPUS2 can also identify
the transmembrane barrel domain in long sequences and predict the
correct topology in ~69% proteins in our dataset. Further,
BOCTOPUS2 predicts the lipid-facing or pore-facing status of resi-
dues in identified ﬁ-strands. We have recently shown that accurate
topology and residue-orientation prediction is beneficial for 3D
modelling of TMBs (Hayat et al., 2015).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Somatic internal tandem duplications (ITDs) are known to
play important roles in cancer pathogenesis. Although recent ad-
vances in high-throughput sequencing technologies have enabled
genome-wide detection of various types of genomic mutations, includ-
ing single nucleotide variants, indels and structural variations, only a
few studies have focused on lTDs. We have developed an analytical
tool called ‘Genomon lTDetector’ for genome-wide detection of som-
atic ITDs. After evaluating the sensitivity and precision of the proposed
approach using synthetic data, we have demonstrated that it can suc-
cessfully detect not only common lTDs involving FLT3, but also a
number of lTDs affecting other putative driver genes in acute myeloid
leukemia exome sequencing data.

able at https://github.com/ken0-1n/Genomon-lTDetector

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in high-throughput sequencing technologies
have enabled genome-wide detection of various genomic alter-
ations in cancer cells, and a number of analytical tools have been
developed for detecting single nucleotide variants, short indels
(Shiraishi et al., 2013) and structural variations (SVs) from
cancer genome sequencing data. On the other hand, it is widely
known that an internal tandem duplication (ITD) that involves
several tens to several hundreds of nucleotides represents a
common type of somatic alteration that plays an important
role in cancer pathogenesis through either activating or inactivat-
ing affected genes. In particular, ITDs involving FMS-like tyro-
sine kinase 3 (FLT 3) are among the most frequent genetic
lesions, and are found in ~30% of patients with acute mye-
loid leukemia (AML), leading to aberrant activation of the
kinase and negatively affecting survival (Kindler et al., 2010).
However, despite their potential importance in cancer

development, somatic ITDs have been poorly focused because
most current approaches are not sensitive enough to identify
indels of more than several tens of base pairs or SVs within
small-scale regions (<1000 bp), rendering ITDs as “blind spots’
for most existing analytical methods. In this article, we present a
novel software application, Genomon ITDetector, which is spe-
ciﬁcally designed for performing sensitive and genome-wide
detection of somatic ITDs spanning several tens to several hun-
dreds of base pairs from cancer genome sequencing data.

2 METHODS

When short reads at the positions of ITDs are aligned using tools such as
BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009), which support partial alignment, they show
characteristic patterns: soft-clipped sequences (i.e. an unmatched frag-
ment in a partially mapped read, see Fig. la) are observed outside the
breakpoint pairs, corresponding to the sequences inside the breakpoint
pairs (which we call ITD breakpoint pairs, ITD-BPPs, see Fig. lb). The
basic strategy for detecting somatic ITDs using Genomon ITDetector is
to initially perform genome-wide identiﬁcation of ITD-BPPS in the target
tumor sample, and then ﬁlter out uncertain candidates to remove false
positives because of the mis-alignments caused by redundancy of the
genome, relying on multiple non-matched control samples
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Brieﬂy, the procedure adopted in Genomon
ITDetector after sequencing alignment is as follows (see Supplementary
Materials for details):

(1) All the soft-clipped reads satisfying the conditions in
Supplementary Materials S.l in the target tumor sample are
remapped to the human reference genome (see Fig. lb), and
ITD-BPPs are identified (see also Supplementary Fig. S2).

Support reads and their mate pairs for each ITD-BPP are
assembled to generate a contig sequence. Then, the contig sequence
is checked to determine whether it truly contains the sequence
being inside the corresponding ITD-BPP [which we call presumed
duplicated nucleotides (PDN)]. For this purpose, alignment of the
contig sequence to the reference genome sequence around the cor-
responding ITD-BPP is performed to extract the excess unaligned
part [which we call observed inserted nucleotides (OIN)], and the
OIN is compared with the PDN of the corresponding ITD-BPP by
pairwise alignment. Based on these results, we assign a degree of
confidence to each ITD as follows (see Supplementary Fig. S3):

0 ITD grade A: The contig sequence covers (aligns to) the nucleo-
tides to the left and right of the ITD-BPP (i.e. the start and end
alignment positions of the contig sequence are exactly the same
as the left and right of the ITD-BPP, respectively). Furthermore,

3 RESULTS
3.1 Analysis of synthetic data

Using synthetic data, we evaluated the sensitivity and precision
of Genomon ITDetector by altering three parameters: allele
frequency, read depth and ITD length. See Supplementary
Materials for detailed simulation settings. Here, we only counted
ITDs identiﬁed as grade A.

As shown in Figure 10, the sensitivity of the method was im-
proved by increasing the read depth and allele frequency.
However, even with sufﬁcient read depths and allele frequencies,
the sensitivity did not reach 100%, probably because of the
difﬁculty of identifying ITDs located in repeat regions
(Supplementary Fig. S4). Despite this minor limitation,
Genomon ITDetector achieved sufﬁciently high sensitivity for
practical use. For example, as described in Figure 10, >90%
sensitivity was obtained in the detection of ITDs spanning
20—60 hp at an allele frequency of 30% (which is the minimum

condition for acceptable samples in the TCGA project, http://
cancergenome.nih.gov/cancersselected/biospeccriteria) and read
depths of 100 [close to the mean and median of the exome
sequencing data used in the Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA)
AML project (Ley et al., 2013)]. For ITDs spanning >70 bp,
sensitivity was signiﬁcantly increased by adding ITDs identiﬁed
as grades B and C (Supplementary Fig. S5 and Table S1).
Furthermore, the sensitivity decreased as the read length
decreased (see Supplementary Materials).

3.2 Analysis of TCGA AML data

We used Genomon ITDetector to analyze exome sequencing
data from 94 paired AML samples (Ley et al., 2013, see
Supplementary Materials for the detailed procedure). Please
refer to Supplementary Figure S6 for each of the ﬁltering steps
used to reduce putative false positives. The computational
resources required were 1 CPU core [Intel Xeon X5675
(3.06 GHZ)], 5.0—7.7 GB, for each process. The average calcula-
tion time was 4.2 h, with a maximum of 22h and a minimum of
1.5 h. In total, we identiﬁed 719 ITDs in coding regions, of which
45 and 20 were classiﬁed as grades A and B, respectively. ITDs
involving FLT 3 were identiﬁed in 20 samples (grade A: 16, grade
B: 1, grade C: 6; see Supplementary Fig. S8). Furthermore, ITDs
affecting cancer genes (registered in the Cancer Gene Census,
http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cancergenome/projects/census/), such
as CEBPA (Lin et al., 2005), KIT (Corbacioglu et al., 2006)
and WT I , were identiﬁed as grade A. These results showed
that Genomon ITDetector is able to detect a number of ITDs
in putative cancer driver genes with high sensitivity
(Supplementary Table S2).

3.3 Comparison with Pindel

Most existing methods focus only on SVs of at least several
hundred base pairs in size. Although Pindel (Ye et al., 2009)

can detect short (10—200 bp) tandem duplications, it is not spe-
ciﬁcally designed for detecting ‘somatic’ changes.

To evaluate the performance of Genomon ITDetector, we
devised a simple framework for the detection of somatic ITDs
using Pindel (s—Pindel) and compared it with Genomon
ITDetector. These results suggested that although s-Pindel de-
tected a similar number of FLT 3-ITDs to Genomon ITDetector,
it produced more putative false positives. Therefore, a simple
extension of Pindel is not sufﬁcient for accurate genome-wide
screening of somatic ITDs, and Genomon ITDetector is a sig-
niﬁcant advancement. However, there is room for further im-
provement in Genomon ITDetector, as several probable ITDs
were identiﬁed only by s-Pindel. The details of this comparison
are shown in Supplementary Material S6. Integration of the
merits of Pindel and Genomon ITDetector to produce a more
sensitive and accurate software will be investigated in the future.

4 DISCUSSION

The effectiveness of Genomon ITDetector for detecting somatic
ITDs was demonstrated using both synthetic and real data. Still,
there are several remaining issues. First, the current approach
cannot detect ITDs with more than two duplicates. One possible
solution would be to check whether the DIN in the assembled
contig sequence is double, triple or greater of the PDNs. Second,
the proposed approach is for somatic ITD detection only, not
germ line detection. For the detection of germ line ITDs, align-
ment artifacts and germ line ITDs must be effectively distin-
guished. For this ﬁltering, use of multiple non-matched control
samples may provide a solution; however, the data cannot be
used directly in our current method, and this problem requires
further investigation.

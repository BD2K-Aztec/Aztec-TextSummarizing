ABSTRACT

Motivation: Transcription factors (TFs) are crucial during the lifetime
of the cell. Their functional roles are defined by the genes they
regulate. Uncovering these roles not only sheds light on the TF at
hand but puts it into the context of the complete regulatory network.
Results: Here, we present an alignment- and threshold-free
comparative genomics approach for assigning functional roles to
DNA regulatory motifs. We incorporate our approach into the GOMO
algorithm, a computational tool for detecting associations between
a user-specified DNA regulatory motif [expressed as a position
weight matrix (PWM)] and Gene Ontology (GO) terms. Incorporating
multiple species into the analysis significantly improves GOMo’s
ability to identify GO terms associated with the regulatory targets
of TFs. Including three comparative species in the process of
predicting TF roles in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Homo sapiens
increases the number of significant predictions by 75 and 200%,
respectively. The predicted GO terms are also more specific,
yielding deeper biological insight into the role of the TF Adjusting
motif (binding) affinity scores for individual sequence composition
proves to be essential for avoiding false positive associations. We
describe a novel DNA sequence-scoring algorithm that compensates
a thermodynamic measure of DNA-binding affinity for individual
sequence base composition. GOMo’s prediction accuracy proves
to be relatively insensitive to how promoters are defined. Because
GOMO uses a threshold-free form of gene set analysis, there are
no free parameters to tune. Biologists can investigate the potential
roles of DNA regulatory motifs of interest using GOMO via the web
(http://meme.nbcr.net).

1 INTRODUCTION

The regulation of gene expression is crucial in the development
and functioning of cells. DNA—binding proteins called transcription
factors (TFs) are one cog in the regulatory machinery shared by
all cellular and multi—cellular organisms. The human genome, for
instance, is estimated to contain up to 3000 such TFs, of which only
about 1000 are annotated as such, and only 62 have experimentally

veriﬁed in vivo DNA—binding and regulatory activity (Vaquerizas
et al., 2009). For the vast majority of TFs in higher organisms, the
set of genes they regulate, as well as the biological functions they
are involved in, is largely unknown.

However, for a growing number of TFs, models of their
DNA—binding propensities are known. The advent of protein binding
microarrays (PBMs) in particular is rapidly making DNA—binding
afﬁnity data available for large numbers of TFs in many
species (Berger and Bulyk, 2009). Another source of DNA—binding
afﬁnity data for TFs is chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by
deep sequencing (ChIP—seq; Barski and Zhao, 2009). Both of these
types of data can be used to construct a ‘position weight matrix’
(PWM; Stormo, 2000) model of the DNA—binding afﬁnity of a given
TF. Such models are herein referred to as motifs, and can also model
the DNA—binding afﬁnity of other molecules, including microRNAs.
Gene expression data can also be used to discover DNA—binding
motifs utilizing ab initio motif discovery from the promoters of sets
of co—expressed genes (Roven and Bussemaker, 2003). In contrast
to the PBM and ChIP—seq approaches, motif discovery in sets of
co—expressed genes usually results in DNA—binding motifs for which
the binding molecule (e. g. TF or microRNA) is unknown.

One application of DNA—binding motifs is the in silico prediction
of the regulatory targets of the TFs. To predict the targets of a
TF, its binding motif is used to score promoter regions of genes
for their potential to bind the TF protein. It is well—known that
such predictions are not very speciﬁc, and many false positives
must be tolerated if all regulatory targets of a TF are to be
detected (Wasserman and Krivan, 2003). However, as we have
previously shown, even such noisy TF target predictions contain
sufﬁcient information to allow us to make useful predictions of the
biological roles of the TF (Boden and Bailey, 2008). The focus of the
current work is to improve the sensitivity of computational methods
that make TF role predictions using DNA—binding motifs.

Our original method for predicting the roles of TFs starts with
a PWM motif describing the DNA—binding afﬁnity of the TF. We
use the PWM to score the promoter region of each gene in the
genome for its likelihood to be bound by the TF. We then use the
resulting ‘afﬁnity’ scores to test each term in the Gene Ontology
(GO; Ashbumer et al., 2000) for association with high—scoring
genes. In contrast to other approaches (e. g. Sinha et al., 2008) that
use an user—speciﬁed afﬁnity score threshold to separate TF target
genes from non—targets, we use the Mann—Whitney U—test (Mann and
Whitney, 1947), also known as Wilcoxon rank sum test, to determine
if the genes associated with a particular GO term have signiﬁcantly
high scores. This method was implemented in the original

Assigning roles to DNA regulatory motifs

 

GOMO algorithm (B oden and Bailey, 2008), which reports GO terms
with signiﬁcant rank sum P—values, after adjusting for multiple tests.

One obvious place to look for improvement in TF role prediction
is in the quality of the PWM—based function used by GOMO to
score promoter regions for their potential to be targets of the TF.
In a similar application, other researchers (Sinha et al., 2008) used
the likelihood function of a motif—based hidden Markov model
(HMM) to score promoters. They then reran the HMM 100 times on
shufﬂed versions of the promoter in order to convert the likelihood
to a P—value, which they used as their ﬁnal target function. This
scoring function is computationally expensive compared with the
‘average motif afﬁnity’ (AMA) function used by GOMO (Fig. 2 in
Supplementary Material 1). It does, however, reduce the signiﬁcance
of binding afﬁnity scores for promoters whose GC content is similar
to that of the motif, which has been suggested to be important when
using DNA—binding scores in gene set enrichment analyses (Sinha
et al., 2008). In the current work, we examine the importance of
GC content compensation for binding afﬁnity scores, and develop a
more computationally efﬁcient scoring algorithm.

A second obvious approach to consider for improving TF role
prediction algorithms is to use comparative genomics. Such an
approach assumes that functional TF binding sites are to some
degree conserved in the promoters of orthologous genes from related
species. Based on this assumption, numerous methods for motif—
based TF binding site and TF target gene prediction have been
developed that utilize sets of orthologous sequences from multiple
species. The validity of the assumption is evident from the success
of such methods, which includes phylogenetic footprinting and
phylogenetic motif modeling (Hawkins and Bailey, 2008). We could
chose to use one of these methods to score genes for their likelihood
as targets of a given TF, rather than one of the single—species binding
afﬁnity—based motif scores used by GOMO or Sinha et al. (2008).
However, the above phylogenetic scoring methods require multiple
alignments of orthologous genes from species being compared,
and they suffer when the alignments contain inaccuracies or when
the location or orientation of the TF binding sites has not been
conserved (Moses et al., 2006). Phylogenetic motif modeling has
the additional problem of not scaling well to more than about ﬁve
related species (Hawkins and Bailey, 2008).

In this work, we present a comparative genomics extension to
GOMO (‘multiple—species GOMO’) that does not require multiple
alignments. The approach requires sets of orthologous gene
sequences, but does not require (nor use) alignments of the
sequences. Instead, our method estimates the association between
the query TF and a GO term independently for each species,
and then combines these single—species association scores into a
single score for the TF—GO term pair. As our method requires
only a single GO map, only one of the species need functional
annotation. We use multiple— species GOMO to as sign functional roles
to TFs in bacteria, fungi and mammals, and validate the accuracy
of these predictions using known sets of regulatory targets for
a number of TFs. We further validate the predictions made by
multiple—species GOMO by conducting a false discovery rate (FDR)
analysis of the predicted TF—GO term associations. The enhanced
version of GOMO is available for download and GOMO’s functionality
has been fully integrated with the MEME motif discovery tool
(Bailey et al., 2009; http://meme.nbcr.net), so that motifs discovered
by MEME can be sent with a single mouse click to GOMO for
analysis.

2 METHODS
2.1 Incorporating comparative genomics into TF role
prediction

Our alignment—free approach for improving the motif—based prediction of
the roles of TFs is quite straightforward. In a nutshell, it works as follows.
The input consists of a DNA—binding motif, a G0 annotation map and the
promoter sequences for n genomes. Using the method described in Bode’n
and Bailey (2008) (and see below), we compute an association score between
the (putative) targets of the input TF motif and each GO term in the GO map.
We do this separately n times, each time using the promoter sequences from
a different genome. We then combine the n scores for each TF—GO term
pair into a single score. The ﬁnal output of the method is, for each TF—GO
term pair, the q—value of the combined score. The details of the algorithm
are given below, and illustrated in Figure 5 in Supplementary Material 1.

The ﬁnal score of our method combines the evidence for a TF—GO term
association from each of the species. This is done by combining the single—
species scores (P—values) for a single TF—GO pair by taking their geometric
mean, which is a simple way to combine evidence from multiple P—values.
Thus, if SM- is the association score for GO term t computed using genome
ie [1, ...,n], then the overall association score for term t is deﬁned as

l/n
S. = (USN) . (1)

The distribution of this score is not easy to estimate analytically due to
the non—independence of the P—values being combined. Therefore, we use a
permutation test to assign statistical signiﬁcance (q—values) to the multiple—
species association scores, 5,, as we describe below.

The permutation test we use for computing the statistical signiﬁcance
of St, the association score for GO term t with respect to the current TF
motif, is based on essentially the same null model as the rank sum test. The
rank sum test null model assumes that the order of the gene names, when
sorted by motif afﬁnity score, is random. Therefore, our test permutes the
assignment of gene names to scores. Because the binding afﬁnity scores for
orthologous genes are highly correlated, we permute the gene names for each
species in exactly the same way. Failure to do this results in a null model
that overestimates the signiﬁcance of some TF—GO term associations (data
not shown). As illustrated in Supplementary Material 1, Figure 4, after each
permutation of the gene—name—to—score relationships, we compute null scores
for all terms t. In this study, we repeat this process for 100 permutations,
resulting in 100 null scores for every GO term, t. For a given TF, different GO
terms have very similar null score distributions (data not shown). So, in order
to increase the statistical power of the permutation test, we treat all sampled
scores for a single TF motif as samples from a single null distribution. This
gives us 100x null scores for estimating the signiﬁcance of 5,, where x is
the total number of GO terms. We compute empirical P—values for each
real S, by counting the number of null scores that are smaller than S, and
then dividing by the total number of null samples. These P—values are then
adjusted for multiple tests by conversion to q—values using the method of
Storey et al. (2004).

Our previous implementation of GOMO uses the ‘AMA’ score to rank
promoters as (putative) targets of a TF. However, because the base
composition of promoters in higher eukaryotes is highly variable (Sinha
et al., 2008), binding afﬁnity scoring methods that ignore this variability
might predict TF—GO term associations that are not biologically meaningful.
For this study, we therefore developed a new version of the AMA algorithm
(part of the MEME Suite of tools; Bailey et al., 2009) that analytically
estimates P—values for AMA scores based on a zero—order Markov model
of the particular promoter sequence being scored (described in Fig. l in
Supplementary Material 1). For reasons of computational efﬁciency, this
is implemented assuming that the sequence has equal G and C content on
a given strand, i.e. Pr(G) = Pr(C), and likewise for A and T. The method
computes analytical AMA score distributions for a range of GC contents,
and uses linear interpolation to estimate the P—value of the AMA score of a

sequence, based on its actual GC content. AMA can also compute P—values
that are not compensated for the GC content of individual sequences, but
are based on a single, zero—order Markov model of all the promoters in a
genome. Compared to the motif—based HMM (HMMO) introduced by Sinha
et al. (2008), which calculates empirical P—values for each sequence, our
GC—compensated version of AMA, which calculates analytical P—values, is
almost an order of magnitude faster. The P—values computed by the two
methods have a median correlation coefﬁcient of 0.92 for the yeast motifs
(Fig. 2 in Supplementary Material 1). This speedup is important, because it
makes a web—based version of GOMO feasible. Unless noted, in this study all
results are based on GC—corrected AMA scores.

2.2 Evaluation methods and datasets

We study the ability of our prediction method (GOMO) to correctly
identify associations between the target genes of a TF and GO functional
categories, given only the DNA—binding motif of the TF. We focus on three
relatively well—studied species: Escherichia coli, Saccharomyces cerevisiae,
Homo sapiens. For each species, we utilize its GO annotation, the sequences
of its promoters, the sequences of promoters of orthologous genes from three
additional species and a species—speciﬁc set of TF binding motifs. To evaluate
prediction accuracy, we create two sets of reference TF—GO associations
based on the known targets of the TFs in E. coli and S. cerevisiae, respectively
(Supplementary Material 2). (We do not create a reference set of associations
for H.sapiens due to the relatively small number of known gene targets for
human TFs.) We measure the accuracy of the associations predicted by GOMO
with these reference associations in terms of the area under the ROC curve
(AUC). As a second measure of prediction reliability, we use FDR analysis.

2.2.] Evaluation using known TF—GO term associations To create our
reference sets of TF—GO associations for E.coli and S.cerevisiae, we apply
the approach described in our previous study (Bode’n and Bailey, 2008). For
each organism, we ﬁrst obtain a set of known gene targets for TFs. We obtain
the known gene targets of TFs from REGULONDB v6.2 (Gama—Castro et al.,
2008; http://regulondb.ccg.unam.mx/) for E.coli and from Maclsaac et al.
(2006) for S.cerevisiae. We then perform gene set enrichment analysis by
applying the Fisher’s exact test (Fisher, 1958) to the intersection of the set
of known targets of a single TF and the set of genes annotated with a given
GO term. We include a TF—GO term pair in our reference set for the given
organism if, after adjusting for multiple tests, the enrichment is signiﬁcant at
0.01 level. Consistent with previous researchers (e. g. Sinha et al., 2008), we
do not include any TF—GO pairs containing non—speciﬁc GO terms—terms
that are annotated to >20% of genes in the given genome. Our E. coli reference
set of TF—GO associations contains 87 TF—GO pairs, and our S.cerevisiae
set has 503 pairs.

We utilize our TF—GO association reference sets to measure the accuracy
of predictions made by GOMO. We treat the TF—GO pairs in the reference set
for a given species as ‘positives’, and all other TF—GO pairs as ‘negatives’.
Our accuracy metric is AUC50, AUC up to the 50th false positive (Gribskov
and Robinson, 1996), when all TF—GO terms are sorted by increasing score
5,. This metric is appropriate because it emphasizes differences in accuracy
among prediction methods where it matters to biologists—in the short list of
most conﬁdent predictions made by a prediction method. We compute the
AUC50 for each TF represented by at least one TF—GO pair in the reference
set for a given species. The AUC50 value will be 1 if GOMO assigns lower St
scores to all the GO terms associated with the TF according to reference set
( ‘positive’ GO terms) than it does to other GO terms (‘negative’ GO terms).
It will be zero if 50 (or more) ‘negative’ GO terms have lower St scores than
the GO terms associated with the TF according to reference set. Our ﬁnal
accuracy measure for the species is the average of the AUC50 values of the
TFs that have GO terms in the reference set.

2.2.2 Evaluation using FDR To further evaluate the reliability of TF—GO
term associations predicted made by GOMO, we also perform FDR analysis.
FDR analysis allows us to estimate the fraction of predicted associations that

are statistically signiﬁcant, but cannot guarantee the biological signiﬁcance
of predictions. Nonetheless, FDR analysis has been widely used for
estimating the accuracy of both TF role predictions (Sinha et al., 2008) and
TF binding site predictions (Kheradpour et al., 2007) when only incomplete
or noisy validation sets are available. As discussed in Section 2.1, GOMO
computes the q—values of all TF—GO term associations from their empirical
P—values. The q—value of a TF—GO pair represents the minimum FDR at
which that association would be considered signiﬁcant. Therefore, we report
the number of associations detected at a q—value of 0.05. When computing
q—values, we combine the P—values of all TF—GO pairs for a single organism
across all TFs used as queries in order to adjust for all of the multiple tests
conducted. As a further check on our FDR estimates, we verify that no
signiﬁcant predictions are reported when the input sequences are permuted.

2.2.3 Binding motifs We perform our study using position—speciﬁc
probability representations of TF binding motifs taken from the following
sources. For E. coli, we use 85 of the 88 TF motifs from the PRODORIC database
release 8.9 (http://prodoric.tu—bs.de/; Mijnch et al., 2003). (We discard three
TF motifs—MX000203, MX000181 and MX000160—because they are
highly similar to other motifs.) For S.cerevisiae, we use the 124 yeast TF
binding motifs from Maclsaac et al. (2006). For H.sapiens, we use the
56 H.sapiens TF motifs contained in the JASPAR CORE database release
2008 (Sandelin et al., 2004). We use all of the above motifs in the FDR
analysis, and the subsets referenced in the TF—GO association reference sets
for E. col i and S. cerevisiae in the AUC50 accuracy analysis. When the original
source gives the motif in terms of observed ‘counts’, we convert them to
position—speciﬁc probability PWMs by adding ‘pseudocounts’ of 0.01 times
the average base frequencies in the organism’s promoter sequences, B, before
normalizing to probabilities.

2.2.4 Promoter sequences We create sets of promoter sequences for each
of our key species, E.coli, S.cerevisiae and H.sapiens. Then, for each key
species, we identify the orthologous genes in each of three related species
and construct three additional sets of promoter sequences. Critically, in the
related—species promoter sets, we use the gene name from the orthologous
gene in the key species as the gene name for a promoter. This allows us to use
the GO map for the key species when we compute the association scores for
the related species. Our related species for E. coli (K12) are E.coli (CT F 073),
Salmonella typhimurium and Shigella ﬂexneri 2a. Our S.cerevisiae related
species are S. paradoxus, S.mikatae and S. bayanus. For H. sapiens, our related
species are Mus musculus, Canisfamiliaris and Equus caballus.

Our deﬁnition of what a promoter is depends on the key species. For
S. cerevisiae and H.sapiens, we deﬁne the promoter to be the upstream region
[relative to the transcription start site (T88) of a gene]. Because prokaryotes
organize their genes into transcriptional units and operons that are transcribed
together, for E.coli we deﬁne promoters to be the sequence upstream of
operons, rather than of genes. We take operon information for E.coli K12
from REGULONDB v6.2 (Gama—Castro et al., 2008).

To identify orthologous genes in species related to E.coli, we use the
ENTEROBACTER GENOME BROWSER (http://engene.ﬂi—leibniz.de/) to search for
best pairwise BLAST hits to E.coli K12 genes. For simplicity, we assume
that the operons are not altered across the species, i.e. the genes and
their order stay the same in an operon across closely related species.
To identify orthologous genes in S. cerevisiae relatives, we use the mappings
from Kellis et al. (2003). To identify genes orthologous to H.sapiens genes
in related species, we use one—to—one ortholog gene maps obtained from
BIOMART (Smedley et al., 2009).

To create the promoter sequence sets for E. coli and S. cerevisiae and related
species, we use the RSAT sequence extraction tool (Thomas—Chollier et al.,
2008). We study varying the size of the upstream region, as well as allowing it
to overlap upstream open reading frames (ORFs). We refer to the truncated
promoters as the ‘intergenic’ set, and to the promoters that (may) overlap
upstream ORFs as the ‘full’ set. For H.sapiens and related species, we deﬁne
the promoter to be the 1000 bp upstream of the TSS, and extract them using
BIOMART (Smedley et al., 2009).

Fig. 1. Single—species GOMO prediction accuracy using transferred GO maps. Each point shows the average AUC50 of TF—GO term associations predicted
by GOMO using the E. coli (3) or S. cerevisiae (b) GO map and TFs, and promoter sequences from the single given species. The AUC50 is computed using a
single TF, then averaged over TFs. The X —axis shows the maximum upstream extent of promoter sequences, which are truncated at the ﬁrst ORF. The inset
shows the phylogenetic tree of the corresponding species. Branch lengths denote average substitutions per site.

2.2.5 G0 annotation To create GO maps for the three key species, we use
the E. coli GO annotation ﬁle v1.5, S. cerevisiae v1.1411 and H.sapiens v1.12,
respectively. From each of these ﬁles, we create a G0 map ﬁle that lists, for
each GO term, the gene names annotated with it. Note that for E.coli, our
promoters are upstream of operons, not genes, so our E.coli GO map maps
GO terms to operons. To create this map, we ﬁrst use the GO annotation ﬁle
for E. coli to assign to each operon the union of all GO terms associated with
any gene contained in the operon.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Successful transfer of GO annotation to related
species

Our method for incorporating comparative genomics into TF role
prediction depends on GO annotation being reliable when mapped
from a gene in the key species to its ortholog in another species.
The validity of this assumption is borne out for our choice of related
species for E. coli and S. cerevisiae by the results shown in Figure 1,
which is based on running GOMO with promoters from a single
species. For a wide range of size deﬁnitions of the promoter regions,
the accuracy (mean AUC50) of TF—GO term associations predicted
by GOMO for the related species is similar to the accuracy using the
key species. Indeed, for E.coli, the measured accuracy is slightly
higher using the promoters from its related species (Fig. 1a). The
E.coli reference set contains only 87 TF—GO term pairs, thus its
accuracy measurements are based on a fairly small sample. The
S.cerevisiae reference set is much larger (503 TF—GO term pairs),
and the prediction accuracy using S. cerevisiae promoters is very
similar to that using promoters from two of its related species
(Fig. 1b). Somewhat surprisingly, using promoters from S.mikatae
yields lower accuracy than using those from S. bayanus, even though
S.mikatae appears evolutionarily closer to S.cerevisiae based on
multiple alignments of all orthologous intergenic regions (Kellis
et al., 2003). The phylogenetic trees shown in Figure 1 are for
reference only—our method does not use them. We created the
phylogenetic tree for enterobacter from our 1500 bp promoter
sequences using the topology from Elena et al. (2005). The tree
for yeast is from Kellis et al. (2003) and is based on intergenic
sequences.

3.2 Appropriate size for promoters

The (maximum) size of the upstream region deﬁned to be the
promoter of a gene affects the accuracy of predictions made by
GOMO, as seen in Figure 1. For both enterobacter and yeast,
prediction accuracy drops sharply if promoters are limited to
upstream regions <500 bp. Increasing the maximum promoter size
seems to confer little or no increase in the accuracy of GOMO
predictions for enterobacter species. However, for yeast species the
optimal promoter size may be closer to 750—1000 bp, which is in
agreement with the observation made by Thomas—Chollier et al.
(2008) that 99% of known regulatory elements in promoters are
found in regions within 800 bp upstream of the TSS.

3.3 Beneﬁts of our comparative genomics approach

We now assess the beneﬁt of using the proposed method of
incorporating comparative genomics into TF role prediction. To do
this, we assess the accuracy of predictions made by single— and
multiple—species GOMO in two ways. First, for E. coli and S. cerevisiae
we utilize ‘gold standard’ sets of TF—GO term relationships for each
of these organisms. We realize that these reference TF—GO term
sets are extremely incomplete due to the current lack of knowledge
about the functions of many TFs. Consequently, although useful for
comparing the accuracy of algorithms, these gold standards will
label many true relationships as ‘false positives’. Therefore, we
also perform FDR analyses of predictions on E.coli, S.cerevisiae
and H.sapiens, and compare the number of statistically signiﬁcant
TF role predictions made by GOMO when using a single species or
when using multiple species. As a further check, we also determine
that GOMO makes no predictions judged by FDR to be statistically
signiﬁcant (a $0.05) when given shufﬂed promoters as input.
Compared with using a single species, GOMO using multiple
species gives a substantial increase in prediction accuracy
(mean AUC50) for the yeast species, and a slight increase for
the enterobacter species (Fig. 2; e.g. compare curves labeled
‘single—species intergenic’ and ‘multiple—species intergenic’). For
yeast, the increase in accuracy is statistically signiﬁcant using
promoters deﬁned as 500, 750 or 1000 bp upstream regions
(P <0.05, two—tailed, paired t—test). This is true both for promoter
deﬁned as upstream regions of the given length (‘full’) and for

Fig. 2. Multiple—species GOMO prediction accuracy. Each point shows the average AUC50 of TF—GO term association predictions made by GOMO in the key
species E. coli (3) or S. cerevisiae ( b). Points labeled ‘multiple—species’ use promoter sequences from the key species and three related species; Monkey results
use Monkey (Moses et al., 2004) minimum P—value scores instead of AMA scores (Supplementary Material 1). Points labeled ‘single—species’ use promoter
sequences from the key species only, and are shown for comparison. The AUC50 is computed using a single TF, then averaged over TFs. The X —axis shows the
upstream extent of promoter sequences (‘full’), or the maximum upstream extent when they are truncated at the ﬁrst ORF (‘intergenic’). For clarity, standard
error bars are shown for the ‘full’ promoter sequence set only; standard error bars for the ‘intergenic’ promoter set are similar.

regions truncated upon reaching an upstream ORF (‘intergenic’).
The improvement in accuracy is due to the use of multiple
genomes—the mean AUC50 is 0.63 using the four yeast
species compared with only 0.53 using the single species (19%
improvement, 1000 bp, ‘full’ promoters). Although using the ‘full’
yeast promoter regions yields slightly better accuracy than using
the truncated regions, this difference is not statistically signiﬁcant.
With enterobacter, the increase in accuracy using multiple species
is smaller than with yeast, and the relatively small size of the set of
known enterobacter TF—GO term associations (only 87 compared
with 503 pairs) causes the error bars to be large. However, in our
FDR analysis below, only using multiple species allows GOMO to
discover any statistically signiﬁcant TF—GO term associations in
E.coli at all.

The multiple—species prediction accuracy results shown in
Figure 2a suggest that the optimal approach for identifying TFjGO
term associations in E.coli is to deﬁne promoters as ‘full’ (non—
truncated) upstream regions of length 1250 bp. However, the
reference set for E. coli contains only 87 TF—GO pairs, so it is not
possible to draw any strong conclusions about the optimal size for
upstream regions to use as enterobacter promoters. Nonetheless, the
results for S.cerevisiae (Fig. 2b), which are based on a much larger
reference set, support a similar promoter deﬁnition. Multiple— species
S. cerevisiae predictions are most accurate using ‘full’ promoters of
length 1000 bp. Longer regions appear to decrease the accuracy of
both single— and multiple—species GOMO, as would be expected if
regions farther than 1000 bp from the TSS were less likely to contain
TF binding sites. Since the AMA score averages the motif afﬁnity
along the entire deﬁned promoter region, the signal—to—noise ratio
decreases when the region is made too long.

As a further evaluation of the plausibility of TF—GO term
predictions made by GOMO, we perform a FDR analysis. As the
ﬁrst step in our analysis, we follow Sinha et al. (2008) and perform
a test where we scramble all of the promoter sequences and
input them to GOMO. For all three key species, both single— and
multiple—species versions of GOMO using GC—compensated AMA
P—values report zero predictions with q§0.05. This provides a
negative control on the reliability of the q—values reported by GOMO.

However, when we score the scrambled yeast species promoters
using non—GC—compensated AMA P—values, we get 41 signiﬁcant
predictions using multiple—species GOMO. For mammalian species,
the number of signiﬁcant predictions using scrambled promoters
is 935 (H.sapiens) and 1403 (multiple—species GOMO). This makes
it clear that normalizing the TF binding afﬁnity scores for the
base content of the promoter sequences is important for accurate
estimation of the FDR. In what follows, we use GC—compensated
AMA P—values as input to GOMO.

Having established that GOMO reports no signiﬁcant (q§0.05)
TF—GO term pairs when given scrambled promoters as input, we
now count the number of signiﬁcant pairs reported when using the
real promoters. Rather than counting all signiﬁcant TF—GO term
pairs, we only count signiﬁcant pairs for the most speciﬁc GO term.
In other words, if for a given TF, the GO term ‘neuroblast division’
and its parent term ‘neurogenesis’ are both deemed signiﬁcant by
GOMO, we only include the former term in our count. Counting in
this way is appropriate because G0 is a hierarchy with the least
speciﬁc terms at the base. If a TF is associated with a GO term,
it is implicitly associated with all the parents of that term. Since a
method that detects associations between a TF and highly speciﬁc
GO terms is more useful than one that reports only general GO
terms, we also measure the average depth of the most speciﬁc GO
terms predicted by GOMO. These results are summarized for both
single— and multiple—species GOMO in Table 1.

Substantially, more signiﬁcant TF—GO term pairs for E. coli,
S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens are predicted by multiple—species GOMO
compared with single—species GOMO (Table 1, ‘signiﬁcant TF—GO
term pairs’). We observe increases of 75 and 200% in the number
of signiﬁcant pairs for S. cerevisiae and H.sapiens, respectively. For
E.coli, there are actually no signiﬁcant pairs (q§0.05) using the
single—species approach, but 14 pairs are signiﬁcant when we use all
four enterobacter promoter sets as input.

The average number of signiﬁcant GO terms predicted for TFs by
GOMO increases accordingly (Table 1, ‘GO terms per TF tested’).
Using four yeast species, multiple—species GOMO predicts about six
most—speciﬁc GO terms per TF; using the four mammal species,
multiple—species GOMO predicts 20 most—speciﬁc GO terms per TF.

The table shows FDR (q f 0.05) results for single- and multiple-species GOMO. The results shown are the total number of most-speciﬁc signiﬁcant pairs (‘signiﬁcant TF—GO term
pairs’), the average number of most-speciﬁc GO terms per TF tested (‘GO terms per TF tested’), the number of TFs with at least one signiﬁcant TF—GO term pair (‘covered TFs’),
the average depth in the GO hierarchy of signiﬁcant GO terms (‘term speciﬁcity’), and the total number of TFs in each experiment ( ‘TFs tested’). All results are for GC-compensated
AMA scores and ‘full’ promoters of 500, 750 and 1000 bp for enterobacter, yeast and mammals, respectively. NA, not applicable.

Very few predictions are made in E. coli when using the four
enterobacter species (0.16 terms per TF tested), indicating that the
sensitivity of multiple—species GOMO in enterobacter is very low.

Using multiple species also increases the chance that GOMO will
predict that at least one GO term is signiﬁcantly associated with a
given TF. No TF—GO term associations are predicted by GOMO using
E. coli promoters alone, whereas using the four enterobacter species,
multiple—species GOMO predicts signiﬁcant associations for nine
(out of 85) TFs (Table 1, ‘covered TFs’). The number of TFs with at
least one signiﬁcant GO term increases by 14% for S. cerevisiae and
17% for H. sapiens when we apply our multiple—species approach. In
S. cerevisiae and H. sapiens, single—species GOMO is more successful
at ﬁnding at least one signiﬁcant GO term for each TF than it is
in E.coli, ‘covering’ 99 (out of 124) TFs in S.cerevisiae, and 48
(out of 56) in H. sapiens. However, using multiple species results in
improvement in this regard as well for S. cerevisiae and H.sapiens.
Multiple—species GOMO identiﬁes at least one signiﬁcant GO term
for almost all yeast TFs (113 out of 124), and for all 56 H.sapiens
TFs tested.

Importantly, the speciﬁcity of predicted GO terms for a given TF
increases when using our multiple species with GOMO (Table 1,
‘term speciﬁcity’). The increase in speciﬁcity (as measured by
the minimum distance from the predicted term to the root of
the GO hierarchy) increases marginally using four species for
S.cerevisiae (2%), and somewhat more (17%) when using four
mammal species for H. sapiens, compared to using a single species.
When we compare the sets of predictions made on H.sapiens
using the single— and multiple—species approach, respectively, we
ﬁnd that only 72 signiﬁcant predictions from the most speciﬁc set
in the single species have no or only less speciﬁc counterparts
in the multiple—species results. In contrast, 950 of the multiple—
species results are more speciﬁc than corresponding single—species
predictions, or are not captured by the single—species approach
at all. Given that the total numbers of signiﬁcant predictions are
371 for single—species and 1112 for multiple—species (Table 1), we
observe a substantial increase in both the number of signiﬁcant
predictions and the speciﬁcity of GO terms when using multiple—
species GOMO. Since more speciﬁc GO terms convey more
detailed biological insight, the predictions made by multiple— species

GOMO are more informative than those made using a single
species.

Finally, GOMO can be used to create ‘role—centric’ regulatory
maps, where TF motifs are connected via the predicted GO terms
considered signiﬁcant (Supplementary Material 1, 3 and 4). This
representation of the data facilitates the identiﬁcation of groups of
TFs that are collectively involved in a particular biological process.
Role—centric maps can also shed light on when secondary binding
motifs (Berger and Bulyk, 2009) are functionally distinct from the
primary binding motif.

4 DISCUSSION

We have presented a comparative genomics approach for assigning
biological roles to sequence motifs using a form of gene set
enrichment analysis. The approach does not require multiple
alignments because role predictions are made independently for
each comparative genome and then combined across genomes.
This means that the method does not assume that the location and
orientation of binding sites is conserved across species. The method
does require that orthologous genes be identiﬁed in the species
being utilized, as would also be the case for a method employing
multiple alignments. The approach also assumes that the functions
of orthologous genes, and the DNA—binding afﬁnity of the regulatory
molecule, have been conserved in the species being used. Although
the above assumptions are no doubt sometimes violated, our
comparative genomics approach nonetheless substantially improves
the sensitivity of TF role predictions.

Our principal result is that it is possible to substantially improve
the prediction of the association of a DNA—binding motif with an
annotation term by mapping the annotation from a key species to
related species, and combining the association scores for a single
motif and term across species. The approach requires only that
we are able to compute the P—value of the motif—term association
in each species, and we combine across species by taking the
geometric mean of the P—values. A simple permutation test then
assigns signiﬁcance values to the combined motif—term score. Since
our method is alignment—free, it avoids problems that would be
caused by imperfect alignments or ‘motif drift’ (Moses et al., 2006).

Our FDR analysis has shown the importance of compensating
motif afﬁnity scores for the base content of the sequences being
scored. We have demonstrated that our GC—compensated AMA scores
pass a ‘shufﬂed sequence test’, yielding no spurious signiﬁcant
predictions using such random data. We have also shown that
our implementation can compute such GC—compensated scores fast
enough to make a web—based service feasible. It should be noted that
GOMO is not limited to AMA—derived gene scores but can work on any
sequence scoring scheme. For example, HMMO (Sinha et al., 2008)
can compute motif afﬁnity scores using more than one TF motif at a
time, which enables GOMO to investigate the role of synergistic TFs.

For the particular case of predicting TF—GO term associations, we
have shown that our method is not particularly sensitive to the size
of the upstream region designated as the promoter of a gene. For
species as diverse as enterobacter and mammals, using regions of
1000 bp upstream of the TSS will probably work about as well as any
other reasonable deﬁnition. Our results indicate that one should not
truncate putative promoters at the nearest upstream ORF, but include
overlapped ORF sequence up to the 1000 bp (or other) limit. This
seems to suggest that closely spaced genes may reciprocally harbor
regulatory sequence elements.

We have shown that using a H. sapiens TF motif with our multiple—
species version of GOMO almost always results in at least one
signiﬁcant prediction of an associated GO term, and in 20 signiﬁcant
terms on average. Most yeast TF motifs also yield at least one
signiﬁcant prediction, but very few E.coli motifs do. The relative
failure of even our multiple—species approach on enterobacter might
be due to the way we aggregate gene annotations for all genes in an
operon, or it might be due to the relative sparsity of GO annotation
for bacteria due to their simple cellular structure. However, other
factors than just the number of terms in the GO hierarchies for
bacteria, fungi and mammals (1654, 4578 and 9409, respectively)
may be at play here.

Although we have focused speciﬁcally on utilizing this approach
with TF motifs and GO annotation via the GOMO software, the
general method should be equally applicable to other types of
sequence motifs (e.g. microRNA—binding motifs) and other types of
annotation (e. g. metabolic pathways or gene sets from analyses of
expression data). Gene set enrichment analysis approaches similar
to single-species GOMO have previously been shown to be useful
with these and other types of motifs and annotation sources (e.g.
Sinha et al., 2008). Since nothing in the implementation of GOMO
is speciﬁc to TFs and GO annotation, multiple-species GOMO can
perform analyses using any type of DNA—binding motif expressed
as a PWM and any mapping of gene names to functional terms (e. g.
pathway names or tissue types). In the future, we will apply multiple-
species GOMO to annotate more extensive collections of motifs with
additional (non—GO) types of functional annotation.

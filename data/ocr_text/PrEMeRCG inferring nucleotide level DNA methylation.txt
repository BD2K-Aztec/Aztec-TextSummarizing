ABSTRACT

Motivation: DNA methylation is an epigenetic change occurring in
genomic CpG sequences that contribute to the regulation of gene
transcription both in normal and malignant cells. Next-generation
sequencing has been used to characterize DNA methylation status
at the genome scale, but suffers from high sequencing cost in the
case of whole-genome bisulfite sequencing, or from reduced reso-
lution (inability to precisely define which of the Cst are methylated)
with capture-based techniques.

Results: Here we present a computational method that computes
nucleotide-resolution methylation values from capture-based data by
incorporating fragment length profiles into a model of methylation ana-
lysis. We demonstrate that it compares favorably with nucleotide-
resolution bisulfite sequencing and has better predictive power with
respect to a reference than window-based methods, often used for
enrichment data. The described method was used to produce the
methylation data used in tandem with gene expression to produce a
novel and clinically significant gene signature in acute myeloid leuke-
mia. In addition, we introduce a complementary statistical method that
uses this nucleotide-resolution methylation data for detection of differ-
entially methylated features.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA methylation, the addition of a methyl group to cytosine
residues in a CpG dinucleotide pair, is one of the best character-
ized epigenetic changes in eukaryotes and plays a pivotal role in
silencing gene transcription in diverse biologic settings, including
embryonic development, lyonization, autoimmunity and cancer

(Feinberg and Tycko, 2004; Richardson, 2007; Smith and
Meissner, 2013). In the context of cancer, with the discovery
that DNA methylation status may carry prognostic information
and with the advent of novel DNA hypomethylating agents (i.e.
aza-nucleosides), the study of the biologic, diagnostic, prognostic
and pharmacodynamic role of DNA methylation has immediate
relevance in the design of novel treatment approaches.

A variety of methods to determine DNA methylation have
been developed and can be broadly categorized on the basis of
methylation readout (bisulﬁte converted versus capture-based
techniques) and of sample or data throughput. Throughput
ranges from low-throughput analysis of a small number of loci
[e. g. methylation profiling of 24 tumor-suppressor gene promoter
CpG islands (Seeber et al., 2010)] to array-based methods with
on the order of 480000 probes in the case of the Infinium
HumanMethylation450 BeadChip, to next-generation sequen-
cing (NGS)-based approaches that offer high-resolution broad
genomic coverage at extremely high throughput. Supplementary
Text and Supplementary Table S1 further describe these tech-
niques and categorize methylation analysis techniques in terms of
readout and throughput.

The gold standard for the characterization of genome-wide
DNA methylation status is whole-genome bisulﬁte sequencing
ONGBS). With the current NGS platforms, data yields in
excess of 300 GB per flow cell, the costs associated with data
generation and analysis for this approach still remain out of
reach, especially if a relatively large number of patient samples
need to be evaluated at diagnosis and at sequential time points
after treatment. Genome complexity-reduction methods such as
reduced representation bisulfite sequencing (RRBS) (Gu et al.,
2011; Meissner et al., 2005), double-enzyme RRBS Wang et al.,
2013), Infinium arrays (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) and
GoldenGate Methylation assay (Bibikova and Fan, 2009) have
been developed to make bisulfite-based approaches more suitable
for large-scale studies. However, one notable drawback of these
methods is the limited proportion of the genome and types of
regions these assays interrogate (Bock et al., 2010). Additionally,
researchers should be aware that the bisulﬁte conversion process
may occur with limited efﬁciency and cannot distinguish between
the two alternative bases, 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxy-
methylcytosine (Jin et al., 2010), which are likely to have differ-
ent biologic signiﬁcance: in contrast to 5-methylcytosine’s

transcriptional repression, the hydroxymethylated bases may
have a transcriptionally activating effect (Ficz et al., 2011).

Capture-based methylated DNA enrichment techniques
(Supplementary Table S1) avoid the majority of the problems
associated with WGBS (cost; complexity), RRBS and arrays
(lengthy procedure that is difﬁcult to automate; limited genomic
scope) and of bisulﬁte chemistry in general [potential for incom-
plete conversion; DNA degradation; the inability to distinguish
methylation from hydroxymethylation (J in at al., 2010)]. Despite
the cost advantage of the capture-based approaches, there has
been some reluctance to adopt these methods owing to a lack of
a nucleotide-level methylation signal. In fact, because the base
unit of information is a DNA fragment captured by a methylcy-
tosine-binding protein or antibody and sequenced, it is presup-
posed that at least some Cst within each sequenced fragment
are methylated because of the capture/enrichment step, but it is
uncertain precisely which CpG dinucleotides within the fragment
are methylated.

Current algorithms associated with these approaches focus on
the methylation signal within genomic ‘windows’, i.e. genomic
intervals of a predetermined nucleotide length. While in the past
we have also used 500 bp windows along the entire genome to
bin enrichment-based sequence ‘reads’ in the analysis of the
global methylation effect of the hypomethylating agent decita-
bine in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) patients (Yan et al.,
2012), we more recently recognized the untapped potential of
transforming read-based data into nucleotide-level data, a solu-
tion that we present here. Nucleotide scale methylation values
computationally derived from captured fragment data are inher-
ently an approximation and therefore cannot completely replace
bisulﬁte-based data. However, this novel approach of transform-
ing read-based data into nucleotide-based signals not only re-
moves artifacts associated with window-based algorithms (e.g.
window-based methods may erroneously assign sequencing
reads to windows devoid of CG dinucleotides; Fig. l) but also
produces ﬂexible intermediate data, unconstrained by genomic
region boundaries, for subsequent analyses. Compared with

with signal artifact

Fig. 1. When methylation signal is determined by dividing the genome
into windows, many windows with no Cst contained within them may
have methylation values ascribed to them. Here, window sizes of 100, 200
and 500 nt are all shown to exhibit this binning artifact. Data shown are
from the present study

other current methods, Probabilistic Extension of Methylated
Reads at CpG resolution (PrEMeR—CG) has the advantage of
not requiring an extra sequencing experiment such as an artiﬁ-
cially methylated sample (Riebler et al., 2014) or a paired restric-
tion enzyme sample (Stevens et al., 2013) to arrive at CpG
resolution signal.

PrEMeR-CG is a computational approach that harnesses the
implicit information associated with library fragment proﬁles to
infer nucleotide-resolution methylation values in addition to read
counts data, and Methylation Modeling Analysis using GEES
(MethMAGE), a complementary statistical method that uses
the nucleotide-resolution methylation data in the detection of
differentially methylated features (DiMer), previously anno-
tated genomic regions in which the methylation proﬁle differs
between different groups (e.g. those treated with a hypomethy-
lating agent versus those that are not). Because enrichment-based
methylome analysis is easily automated and suitable for large
sample size studies, our method provides a critical bridge be-
tween the practicality of capture-based studies and the resolution
of WGBS. This fact is demonstrated by the large AML cohort in
which PrEMeR—CG derived methylation was able to stratify pa-
tients based on outcome and was combined with gene expression
to create a novel prognostic gene signature, which was validated
in other patient cohorts (Marcucci et al., 2014).

2 METHODS
2.1 Methleap-seq library generation and sequencing

Under an institutional review board-approved protocol and with the in-
formed consent of patients, bone marrow (BM) aspirates were procured
from 10 patients with AML. Genomic DNA was extracted from BM
mononuclear cells and sonicated. Methylated DNA fragments were en-
riched with a biotinylated methyl-binding protein pulldown technique.
Libraries were constructed and the methylated fragments were sequenced
on an Illumina GAIIx yielding ~40 x 106 reads of 36 nt per sample.
Sample quality control was evaluated using criteria described in our qual-
ity control module (Trimarchi et al., 2012). For complete details of la-
boratory methods, see the Supplementary Text.

2.2 Methleap-seq read alignment

Passed ﬁlter (using default Illumina pass ﬁlter settings) sequencing reads
were processed to collapse duplicates (i.e. all reads with the same se-
quence information) to a single read to control for polymerase chain
reaction artifacts. Non-duplicate reads were then aligned to the human
reference genome NCBI 36.1 /hg18 using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009).
Alignment parameters allowed for two mismatches in a 32 bp seed and
suppressed all reads that mapped to multiple locations in the genome.

2.3 Assignment of methylation values from Methleap—
seq reads

For Methleap-seq reads, methylation values were assigned by one of
two methods. For the 500 bp window method, we used our previously
published algorithm (Rodriguez et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2012), which bins
the genome into 500 bp windows and assigns a normalized ‘reads per
million’ metric to each window. The method takes each read and extends
it to the average fragment size for the sample. These fragments are then
assigned to the 500 bp window that contains more than half of the ex-
tended fragment, and the total count of these reads in a 500 bp genomic
window represents its methylation value. For the PrEMeR—CG method,
we used the algorithm described in Section 3.

2.4 Reduced representation bisulﬁte sequencing

RRBS sequencing libraries were generated from the same 10 AML pa-
tients described above using a published protocol (Gu et al., 2011). They
were sequenced on the Illumina HiSeq 2000 to generate 50 bp single-end
reads. Sequenced reads were aligned using the Bismark aligner (Krueger
and Andrews, 2011).

2.5 Comparison of methylation calling accuracy

To quantify the accuracy of methylation determination, we compared the
methylation signals of two Methleap-seq—based analysis methods with
that obtained with the RRBS method in matching samples. In order not
to give an advantage to either window-based or CpG-resolution
Methleap-seq analysis methods, we analyzed the performance of each
method at both CpG and 500 bp window resolution. When evaluating
performance at CpG resolution, the methylation values of the CpG reso-
lution method could be used directly (i.e. each CpG could be assigned a
distinct value according to the method described below), whereas for the
window-based method, the methylation value of a window calculated
according to the method described in detail elsewhere (Rodriguez et al.,
2012; Yan et al., 2012) was assigned to all Cst in that window.
Similarly, when evaluating performance at window resolution, the methy-
lation values of the window-based method could be used directly, whereas
for the CpG resolution method, each window was assigned the mean
methylation value of all Cst in that window.

We selected loci for comparison as follows. For the nucleotide-
resolution comparison, we selected all Cst that had a minimum cover-
age of 10 RRBS reads and for which the pulldown-based methylation
call was non-zero. Similarly, for the window-resolution comparison,
we selected genomic windows of ﬁxed width, which had at least two
Cst with at least 10 covering RRBS reads each and for which the
window pulldown-based methylation signal was non-zero.

To compare the two different methods, we constructed receiver-
operator characteristic (ROC) curves using a threshold on each method’s
methylation call as a high/low binary discriminator and the correspond-
ing methylation call from paired RRBS analysis as benchmark, or meas-
ure of truth. Curves were then constructed by plotting the true-positive
rate versus the false-positive rate in ROC space for 100 values of the
respective discriminator. Noting that RRBS methylation signal is
highly concentrated about 0 and 1, consistent with the binary nature of
true methylation, we deﬁned an RRBS signal of <50% as ‘low’ and
250% as ‘high’.

2.6 Determination of DiMer

Methylation status in a region can be compared between two groups
(generically ‘A’ and ‘B’, but in practice perhaps ‘drug treated’ and ‘con-
trol’, or ‘mutated’ and ‘unmutated’), and if different, the region is desig-
nated a DiMeF. DiMer are genomic regions that have deﬁned
boundaries usually based on previous annotation as opposed to the dy-
namically determined boundaries typically associated with differentially
methylated regions. DiMer were determined using a generalized esti-
mating equation (GEE) setup as follows. Suppose we have 11 subjects and
Y,- =(Y,~1, . .. Yik)T, i = l, . . . , n is a vector of nucleotide-resolution methy-
lation signals of subject 1' observed at CpG sites 1, .. . , k within a region.
Then, we model a mean structure with identity link by

MiEE(Yi):/30+,31Xi (1)

with X,- being a vector of indicator function taking the value 1 when
subject 1' belongs to group A and 0 otherwise. Then the estimator of ,8 =
(,80, ,81)T is obtained by solving ,8 such that

n

5(19)=  3:;an — u.) = 0, (2)

 

where V,- = ¢A}/2R,(oz)A}/2 in which A,- is a diagonal matrix with the em-
pirical marginal variances on the diagonal, R,(oz) is a working correlation
matrix and <1) is an over-dispersion parameter. For the working correl-
ation, an autoregressive AR(l) model is used:

COI‘I‘(Y,‘J, Yi,j+s):asa S20: "'a(k  

Such a model is appropriate because the correlation of methylation
signals in Cst is related to proximity of the Cst within the region. For
further details on setting up the model, see Aerts et a]. (2002). Finally, we
tested on H0 : ,81 = 0 versus Ha : ,81 75 0 for each region and selected sig-
niﬁcant regions based on a false discovery rate (FDR)<0.05.

2.7 Calculations

All calculations were performed in Python 2.7 and in R version 2.15 (R
Development Core Team, 2012) with the geepack package (Hejsgaard
et al., 2006), which is available from the CRAN repository.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Sequencing

Genomic DNA from BM samples from 10 AML patients was
extracted and divided into two aliquots; one aliquot was enriched
for methylated DNA (see Section 2). Libraries were prepared
and sequenced on an Illumina GAIIx sequencer resulting in an
average yield of 21629060 reads per sample (range 17 541841—
26 311 159). For validation purposes, the other aliquot was sub-
jected to RRBS (see Section 2) yielding on average 14651361
reads per sample (range 6 289 882—25 039 287).

3.2 Methylation calling with window-based method

One of the major shortcomings of window-based methods in the
analysis of Methleap-seq data is the fact that windows impose
artiﬁcial boundaries along the genome, which can result in ana-
lysis artifacts. To demonstrate this, we used our previously pub-
lished window-based analysis tool (Rodriguez et al., 2012; Yan
et al., 2012) to determine methylation values from our
Methleap-seq data. Figure 1 depicts the number of windows
with attributed methylation signal compared with all windows
containing the indicated number of Cst for various window
sizes. Using this approach, we demonstrated that the window-
based method assigns methylation even in windows that contain
no Cst; this artifact is a result of methylated Cst in neigh-
boring windows pulling down fragments that span the window
boundary and thus are counted even in CpG-less windows.
Despite the disadvantage of containing artifacts, window meth-
ods provide global methylation information for a large portion
of the genome.

3.3 Methylation calling from pulldown data at CpG
resolution

Motivated by the recognition of artifacts in window-based meth-
ods for the analysis of Methleap-seq data, we strove to develop
a method that could use these data to infer methylation values at
CpG resolution; such a method is inherently free from artifacts
associated with window boundaries. An existing boundary-free
tool, BALM (Lan et al., 2011), uses a tag-shifting method with a
bi-asymmetric—Laplace model to identify methylated loci. When
implemented on our data, we noted that BALM covers a

signiﬁcantly reduced portion of the genome than, e. g. the 500 bp
window method (Supplementary Table S2), and we wanted to
develop a method that preserved this global coverage. The idea
behind our new method, which we call PrEMeR-CG, is outlined
in Figure 2A. Although each fragment can localize one or more
methylated Cst necessarily only to within the fragment length
(Fig. 2A top), the overall distribution of fragments still allows
inference of methylation at higher resolution by integrating in-
formation about the overlap of several sequenced fragments
(Fig. 2A bottom). In particular, our method proceeds as follows:

Each aligned read corresponds to one DNA fragment in the
sequencing library captured owing to the presence of methylated
cytosine(s) within the fragment. The length of the DNA fragment
from which any given sequencing read originated is unknown,
but the Bioanalyzer high sensitivity DNA chip used during li-
brary preparation (see Section 2) produces a histogram describ-
ing fragment length frequencies in the library (Fig. 2B). We used
the Bioanalyzer fragment proﬁle information to construct a
probability function for each sample. This probability function
F(k) for a sample is deﬁned as the probability that any given
fragment from that sample has a length greater than a particular
value k; this is also called the complementary cumulative distri-
bution function (CCDF; equation 4; Fig. 2C).

F(k) = 1 — P(X 5 k) = P(X> k) (4)

Next, each sequencing read is extended along its hypothetical
fragment, and any CpG included in the extension is assigned a

weighted portion of that reads signal. The methylation call m,-
imparted by a read to the CpG at the ith position within a given
DNA fragment is calculated ﬁrst by determining the probability
that a fragment containing that CpG existed in the sample, then
dividing by the expected number of Cst (using F and sum-
ming) that likely lie within the fragment giving rise to the read,
yielding:

m, =—f(‘)_ , (5)

2-11%)

for i, j e C, where C is the set of nucleotide indices in the ex-
tended read that are CpG locations. That is, m,- and F are calcu-
lated only at Cst within the fragment. In this step, the
methylation value at each CpG is thus its fractional share of
all Cst, weighted according to the probability that any and
all Cst in the calculation existed in the fragment that generated
the read. For example, if a CpG is within range (described by the
fragment distribution proﬁle) of N reads (even if the read does
not extend over the CpG), the signal imparted to that CpG is the
sum of N probabilities that the fragment was that long. This is
depicted graphically in Figure 2D. The two left most Cst in the
ﬁgure lie within the CCDF graph of one fragment: ﬁrst with near
100% probability, and the second CpG with near zero, but non-
zero, probability. If those probabilities were 0.95 and 0.05, each
CpG would receive that signal. Finally, the so-computed methy-
lation values at individual Cst within the fragment are
summed over all overlapping fragments (i.e. all reads within a

predeﬁned maximal fragment size about the CpG’s position) to
determine an overall probable methylation signal at that CpG
dinucleotide (Fig. 2D). Because each sample has a differing
number of total passed-ﬁlter reads that successfully align to the
genome, the methylation values must also be normalized for total
read yield. We used reads per million aligned reads as a normal-
ization factor to compare across samples.

3.4 Comparison with window-based method

While our CpG resolution method is by deﬁnition free from
window boundary artifacts, we needed to quantitatively compare
its accuracy in determining methylation with that of a window-
based method. To eliminate the requirement for extrinsic infor-
mation [such as an artiﬁcially methylated control sample (Riebler
et al., 2014) or a paired restriction enzyme sample (Stevens et al.,
2013)] and to focus speciﬁcally on the effect of resolution, we
chose our own previously published method (Rodriguez et al.,
2012; Yan et al., 2012) as comparison.

We used RRBS-derived methylation values from the same 10
samples as our Methleap-seq data as a measure of true methy-
lation status for purpose of comparison. We then used PrEMeR-
CG as well as our prior window-based method to assign relative
methylation values and applied various levels of discrimination
to call ‘high methylation’ or ‘low methylation’ from the capture-
based data. By comparing these classiﬁcations with the RRBS
single-base resolution standard, we constructed two sets of ROC
curves as described in Section 2. Figure 3 shows genome-wide
ROC curves in four cases: curves were generated for PrEMeR-
CG and the prior 500 bp window calling method, each at nucleo-
tide resolution and at 500 bp resolution (Supplementary Fig. S1
shows the same results for each of the 10 samples separately).
When evaluating methylation calling according to the RRBS
standard, PrEMeR-CG has a higher area under the curve
(AUC: 0.75 and 0.76), representing higher accuracy in methyla-
tion determination and outperforming the window-based

match to the reference bisulﬁte sequenced samples at both CpG reso-
lution as well as 500 bp window resolution

method (AUC: 0.69 and 0.72) irrespective of the resolution at
which the performance is evaluated. Although these AUCs are
somewhat low, high concordance between Methleap-seq and
RRBS is not anticipated because of the differences in these meth-
odolgies discussed in Section 1. The same analysis was repeated
at the 100 bp window resolution with similar outcomes
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.5 Utilization of CpG-resolution data in the detection of
DiMer

One of the end goals of methylation analysis is to determine
changes between conditions in different genomic regions of inter-
est. To use the inferred single-base resolution data derived from
PrEMeR-CG, a new statistical approach is needed that does not
require averaging methylation signals across regions while iden-
tifying DiMer. For this expressed purpose, we developed a
method called MethMAGE, a domain-speciﬁc use of the GEE.

A primary feature of the nucleotide-resolution data generated
by PrEMeR-CG is that the signals at neighboring CpG sites are
correlated (Supplementary Fig. S3), both because they are
derived from fragments of ﬁnite size and because of biological
correlations between methylation levels at neighboring Cst. In
fact, we believe that one of the main advantages of PrEMeR-CG
is the possibility to explicitly incorporate the correlation structure
of neighboring Cst in DiMeF calling. In addition, the CpG
methylation signals are not normally distributed and have a rela-
tively high proportion of non-detectable signal (zero values). The
GEE approach is non-parametric and ﬂexible with respect to
these signals and explicitly takes into account correlations, and
therefore, is well suited to model the nucleotide-resolution data
generated by PrEMeR-CG. More speciﬁcally, for each genomic
feature, GEE builds a linear model of methylation signals at
CpG sites with working covariance structure (see Section 2).
Because there is a decreasing correlation between CpG sites
with increasing distance along the genome, we chose an autore-
gressive AR(l) model to describe the covariance structure. We
note that this autoregressive AR(l) covariance structure is a
major difference compared with the previous GEE-based differ-
ential methylation calling package A-clust (Sofer et al., 2013) (in
addition to the difference that MethMAGE tests methylation in
features of ﬁxed bounds to call DiMer that accommodate an-
notation whereas A-clust determines regions to test by dynamic-
ally clustering correlated Cst). We believe that the
exchangeable working correlation used by A-clust is appropriate
for the small clusters and short distances that typically separate
the Cst in the clusters detected by A-clust. In contrast, the
AR(1) correlation used by MethMAGE is autoregressive and
more suitable for the expected correlation of methylation in
larger annotated features. The mean difference between case
and control groups is estimated by solving generalized estimation
equations using the GEE function from the R package geepack
(see Section 2). From the ﬁtted data, a P—value is generated for
each feature, and DiMer were then called with the FDR con-
trolled at 0.05 according to the Benjamini—Hochberg procedure
(1995).

To demonstrate the utility of MethMAGE, DiMer were
called between groups that were deﬁned by mutation status.
The choice of mutation status as a classiﬁer was made based

on our previously published work, which showed that the methy-
lation of DiMer speciﬁc to known mutations are prognostic
(Marcucci et al., 2014). We selected RefSeq gene promoters,
deﬁned as 1000 bp up- and downstream of the annotated tran-
scription start sites of RefSeq genes, as well as CpG islands,
deﬁned via their UCSC genome browser track (Gardiner-
Garden and Frommer, 1987; Meyer et al., 2013), as features
because their methylation status is associated with gene regula-
tion. To deﬁne two groups, we chose among the many different
known AML mutations shown to be associated with DiMer in
(Marcucci et al., 2014) the FLT 3-ITD (internal tandem duplica-
tion of the FLT3 gene) status as the grouping criterion because it
provided the most balanced separation of our group of 10 pa-
tients (seven FLT 3 wild type and three FLT 3-ITD patients).
MethMAGE is also able to eliminate features if they do not
have sufﬁcient coverage among the sample groups for a statis-
tical test of the model to be meaningful. For the sample groups
used here, 94% of the promoters and 91% of the CpG islands
contained sufﬁcient coverage to be included in MethMAGE
(Table l). MethMAGE identiﬁed 181 DiMer in promoters
and 584 DiMer in CpG islands, whereas MEDIPS identiﬁed
four DiMer in promoters and four DiMer in CpG islands,
while zero DiMer were detected by the t—test, and the negative
binomial-based edgeR and DEseq methods (Supplementary
Table S2). Analysis details can be found in the Supplementary
Material.

It is known that P—values generated by the GEE can become
unreliable for small numbers of samples, and it is thus difﬁcult to
assess whether these DiMer are false-positive ﬁndings resulting
from inaccurate estimation of P—values or are biologically mean-
ingful DiMer. However, the methylation proﬁles of the ex-
amples shown in Figure 4 and Supplementary Figures S4 and
S5 demonstrate that the regions MethMAGE identiﬁed appear
to have different methylation proﬁles between the wild type and
FLT 3-ITD groups. In addition, the problem of unreliable P-
value estimations, and thus possible false-positive ﬁndings,
should become less of an issue when larger numbers of samples
are compared, given the asymptotic property of GEE.

To assess the performance of MethMAGE, paired RRBS sam-
ples were used to determine which promoters and CpG Islands
were differentially methylated (RRBS DiMer) and which were
not differentially methylated (RRBS non-DiMer).

These RRBS DiMer and non-DiMer, called between the
wild type and FLT 3-ITD group, were compared with the
DiMer reported by MethMAGE. Among the RRBS non-
DiMer, MethMAGE demonstrated a low false-positive rate,
detecting only a single DiMeF (Supplementary Table S4).

4 DISCUSSION

DNA methylation is well established as an epigenetic regulator in
a wide variety of biological processes (Feinberg and Tycko, 2004;
Richardson, 2007; Smith and Meissner, 2013), and recent years
have seen tremendous progress in the laboratory and computa-
tional techniques of methylation analysis (Bock, 2012). Book
at al. analyzed two pairs of samples using two enrichment

methods (MeDIP and Methleap) coupled with NGS and two
bisulﬁte-based methods (RRBS and Inﬁnium assay) (Book at al.,
2010). Compared with MeDIP-seq, Methleap-seq gave rise to
peaks of methylated DNA with higher dynamic range (higher
peaks and lower baseline signals), and the authors noted that
bisulﬁte-based methods generally conﬁrmed the enrichment-
based methods. Overall, when compared with RRBS, the
Methleap-seq method had richer and more even coverage of
the entire genome, including within-key features such as CpG
islands and promoter regions, methylation of which is known
to affect transcription.

Capture-based methods in combination with NGS offer the
potential of cost-effective whole-genome methylation analysis,
with the added beneﬁt of the possibility to distinguish alternative
cytosine modiﬁcations (Jin et al., 2010). Many capture-based
sequencing methods have been implemented with success, assess-
ing methylation in genomic windows, typically 50 bp and larger.
We have previously published a technique for the analysis of
Methleap-seq data in which the genome is divided into
500 bp bins and genome-wide and per-feature differential methy-
lation patterns can be described in terms of these bins (Rodriguez
et al., 2012; Yan et al., 2012).

Still, it is inescapable that bisulﬁte-based methods provide in-
herently higher resolution than capture-based methods, and it is
notable that methylation at an individual CpG dinucleotide has
demonstrated biological importance (Claus et al., 2012). Because
of the foregoing limitations in bisulﬁte as well as capture-based
methods and to make more accurate methylation calls, we were
motivated to devise a comprehensive method for analyzing cap-
ture-based data that could provide genome-wide nucleotide-reso-
lution information as well as deﬁne DiMer between groups, but
that would be free from external requirements (e.g. would not
require a positive control sample treated with the prokaryotic
methyltransferase M.SssI or paired normal samples).

In this article, we proposed a method to provide methylation
values at individual CpG dinucleotides, thereby eliminating
many of the issues associated with larger genomic windows.
For example, once PrEMeR-CG calculates a methylation
signal for each CpG, it is straightforward to assign methylation
signal to any genomic region by averaging over all the Cst
contained in this region. This stands in contrast to window-
based methods in which the raw data must be reanalyzed every
time a new type of genomic region is introduced or one risks
including DNA fragments that overlap a predeﬁned window,
which in turn overlaps the genomic region without the fragment
itself actually overlapping the genomic region. Although the as-
signment of fractional methylation signal to Cst within a read
is straightforward, the key innovation in the PrEMeR-CG
method is the recognition that Cst in a pulled-down fragment
may exist outside the read, and incorporating sequencing-library
fragment length statistics to create a probabilistic model of
methylation by virtually extending reads along their hypothetical
fragments. Sequencing-library fragment statistics, although not
typically available with public datasets, are almost certainly
available to the laboratories and groups who generated the
data: fragment-length proﬁling is an important preparatory
step in sequencing to conﬁrm the lack of adapter dimers as
well as to ensure a speciﬁc average fragment length. To our

knowledge, we are the ﬁrst group to use this highly available
yet underused information in DNA methylation analysis.

Using paired RRBS data from the same samples, we com-
pared PrEMeR-CG with our prior 500 bp window-based
method and demonstrated superior discriminatory power. In
addition, we provide a non-parametric statistical method
(MethMAGE) for detecting changes in methylation within a
deﬁned genomic region (feature) and demonstrated its utility in
identifying regions with methylation differences.

We recognize there are limitations in the present method.
First, these methylation calls are only inferences suitable for dis-
covery and hypothesis generation; important ﬁndings must be
validated by alternative techniques. Second, in any pulldown
experiment there is an inherent bias vis-a-vis the actual fragments
pulled down: density and spatial arrangement of methylated
Cst are known to affect pulldown (Fraga et al., 2003), and
there may exist some other unknown factors that inﬂuence the
afﬁnity of the methyl-binding domain protein for the DNA.
Finally, using RRBS as the standard for comparison in the gen-
eration of the ROC curves may be complicated by the potential
differences in methylation afﬁnities assessed by the two methods
(i.e. RRBS may report both 5-methylcytosine and 5-hydroxy-
methylcytosine, while Methleap may report only 5-methylcyto-
sine). This confounding factor may explain the somewhat low
reported AUC values.

As DNA methylation analysis is increasingly important in the
clinical arena, sample preparation is moving away from manual
preparation to automation. In manual sample preparation, a gel-
based approach is used for fragment selection. It produces a tight
distribution of fragment sizes although ranges can still vary sig-
niﬁcantly from sample to sample as depicted in Figure 2C. With
automation, fragment selection is performed by paramagnetic
bead selection, which produces a broader size distribution
(data not shown) and a longer fall from one to zero in the
CCDF. This heightens the importance of a probabilistic
method such as PrEMeR-CG to take into account library frag-
ment size.

An added incentive in using PrEMeR-CG is its accuracy in
estimating the empirical distribution of fragment size in a sequen-
cing library. We compared the PrEMeR-CG—derived fragment
size to fragment size calculated from aligning paired-end reads
to the genome and found excellent concordance of the distribu-
tions (Supplementary Figure S6). Paired-end data from
Methleap-Seq libraries will allow assignment of the true
length for each fragment rather than using our probabilistic ap-
proach. However, paired-end experiments are more costly. To
that end, our method is the most cost-effective means to infer
nucleotide-level methylation values for a large clinical trial. The
power of this approach is well illustrated by the derivation of a
prognostically signiﬁcant signature by combining gene expres-
sion and methylation data in a cohort of 134 AML patients
(Marcucci et al., 2014).

In conclusion, we have presented an algorithm for inferring
nucleotide-resolution methylation signal from a capture-based
technique and a companion statistical test to detect DiMer
using this nucleotide-level information. Discriminatory power
was demonstrated using biological samples (acute leukemia
BM blasts), and our approach warrants further study in future
experiments.

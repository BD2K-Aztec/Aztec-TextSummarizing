ABSTRACT

Motivation: Throughout the recent years, 454 pyrosequencing has
emerged as an efficient alternative to traditional Sanger sequencing
and is widely used in both de novo whole-genome sequencing and
metagenomics. Especially the latter application is extremely sensitive
to sequencing errors and artificially duplicated reads. Both are
common in 454 pyrosequencing and can create a strong bias in the
estimation of diversity and composition of a sample. To date, there
are several tools that aim to remove both sequencing noise
and duplicates. Nevertheless, duplicate removal is often based on
nucleotide sequences rather than on the underlying flow values,
which contain additional information.

Results: With the novel tool JATAC, we present an approach towards
a more accurate duplicate removal by analysing flow values directly.
Making use of previous findings on 454 flow data characteristics,
we combine read clustering with Bayesian distance measures.
Finally, we provide a benchmark with an existing algorithm.

1 INTRODUCTION

When 454 Life Sciences (now Roche Diagnostics) released the
GS20 sequencing platform in 2005 (Margulies et al., 2005), it was
the start of a revolution in sequencing technology. It has since
been followed by other platforms, both subsequent generations
from 454 and competing technologies like Illumina/Solexa and
ABI/SOLiD. The increased throughput and decreasing per base
cost of these second-generation sequencing technologies have
made high-throughput sequencing an affordable tool for many
new organisms and applications. The traditional Sanger sequen-
cing is now 30 years old (Sanger et al., 1977), and the error
characteristics and artifacts intrinsic to the method are well char-
acterized. Consequently, there are established methods for
describing sequence quality (Ewing et al., 1998; Ewing and
Green, 1998). Standard methods and tools for detecting and
dealing with common contamination like vector sequences or

genomic contamination exist, some of them applicable to one
or several second-generation sequencing technologies (Chou
and Holmes, 2001; Falgueras et al., 2010; Kong, 2011; White
et al., 2008). Experienced researchers will also be aware of the
risk of artifacts like chimeric sequences arising through different
mechanisms (Houseley and Tollervey, 2010; Kanagawa, 2003).

There are numerous approaches to the removal or correction
of erroneous sequences or parts of sequences for different appli-
cations. These are especially tailored to metagenomics, but also
to SNP detection, small RNA discovery and so forth, some of
them using 454 pyrosequencing ﬂow data instead of nucleotide
sequences, with good results (Huse et al., 2007; Kunin et al.,
2009; Quince et al., 2009; Quince et al., 2011; Quinlan et al.,
2008; Sogin et al., 2006; Vacic et al., 2008).

1.1 Background

Apart from sequencing errors, a second issue accounts for incor-
rect conclusions in metagenomic studies. Gomez-Alvarez et a].
(2009) discovered that 454 sequence data contain an over-
abundance of reads that are exact or almost-exact duplicates of
each other. This comprises both identical reads and reads that
start at the same position in the genome but have different
lengths or vary slightly, putatively owing to pyrosequencing
errors. Although erroneous reads lead to an overestimation of
the number of operational taxonomic units in a sample, dupli-
cates artiﬁcially inﬂate the number of reads per operational taxo-
nomic unit, used as an abundance measure. Gomez-Alvarez et a].
(2009) report between 11% and 35% sequences in metagenomic
datasets being artiﬁcial duplicates. With the 454 Replicate Filter
(Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2009; Teal and Schmidt, 2010), they pro-
vide a web-based solution for removing these artifacts, making
use of the CD-HIT suite (Li and Godzik, 2006), a fast clustering
program for sequences. However, CD—HIT was not speciﬁcally
designed for 454 pyrosequencing data and operates on fasta
input, i.e. on nucleotide sequences rather than on ﬂow data,
which is accompanied by information loss (see Section 1.2).
With cd-hit—454, Niu et a]. (2010) provide both a web and a
stand-alone tool for the removal of artiﬁcial duplicates in meta-
genomic pyrosequencing data. Also, PyroCleaner (Mariette
et al., 2011) has been speciﬁcally designed for 454 data, but all
these tools work on nucleotide sequences. Our main motivation
for developing JATAC was to aid metagenomic projects in the
tradition of 454 Replicate Filter and cd-hit—454, but leveraging
additional information present in ﬂow data. J ATAC targets both
the assembly of (meta)genomes and the accurate estimation of

community compositions. Gomez-Alvarez et al. have shown that
failure to remove duplicates resulted in misleading conclusions
on the gene space in soil metagenomes (Gomez-Alvarez et al.,
2009). Furthermore, methods using sequence coverage to identify
repeats (e.g. Malde et al., 2006; Phillippy et al., 2008) should
not be applied to pyrosequencing data without ﬁrst ﬁltering
duplicates.

1.2 Nucleotide space versus flow space

In 454 pyrosequencing, around one million DNA molecules are
sequenced in parallel (~100 000 in the benchtop solution GS
Junior), generating a series of so-called ﬁow values for each mol-
ecule. One ﬁow value corresponds to the number of identical
bases incorporated in a single flow. The cycling order of the
nucleotides is maintained throughout the sequencing process
(T, A, C, G representing one ﬁow cycle). The underlying
sequence is inferred from the respective flow values of each
nucleotide.

Flow values refer to the signal strength of the sequencing
reaction (for details on the sequencing chemistry, see Margulies
et al., 2005). With increasing homopolymer length, the signal
differences and thereby the discriminatory power of the base
calling decrease, resulting in a well-known uncertainty about
exact homopolymer lengths, especially for long homopolymers
(Gilles et al., 2011; Huse et al., 2007; Margulies et al., 2005). As
nucleotide homopolymer length can only be expressed in inte-
gers, it is indispensable to carry out analyses based on ﬂow data
(expressed as double decimal values) instead of nucleotide
sequences, i.e. in ‘ﬂow space’ instead of ‘nucleotide space’.

The native output format of 454 pyrosequencing is the binary
standard ﬁowgram format (*.sff). It contains the ﬁowgram for
each read, whereby each ﬁowgram consists of a sequence of flow
values representing base incorporations. One ﬁowgram corres-
ponds to 800 ﬂows (200 ﬁow cycles) in the GS FLX/Junior
Titanium chemistry, i.e. one ﬁow value per position 1-800. The
GS FLX+ chemistry uses 1600 ﬂows (400 ﬁow cycles).

In the following, we present a reference-free method and algo-
rithm named J ATAC that identiﬁes duplicate reads based on the
flowgram. Methods operating in ﬂow space have been shown
to be superior to methods working in nucleotide space, e.g. for
noise removal in metagenomics amplicon data (see earlier in the
text). Our results indicate that this is also the case for duplicate
removal.

2 DUPLICATE FILTERING

2.1 Natural versus artificial duplicates

Library generation for 454 pyrosequencing involves an emulsion
polymerase chain reaction (PCR) step where water-oil droplets
are formed (Tawﬁk and Grifﬁths, 1998; Williams et al., 2006).
This segregates the complex reaction mixture into miniaturized
compartments and allows for highly multiplexed DNA ampliﬁ-
cation reactions. In these so-called micro-reactors, single DNA
molecules are clonally ampliﬁed onto beads and are then de-
posited on a PicoTiterPlateTM (PTP) for sequencing (Leamon
et al., 2003; Margulies et al., 2005). An inherent artifact of 454
library preparation and sequencing is the generation of artiﬁcial
duplicate sequences as a result of the emulsion PCR step.

There are three suspected sources for artiﬁcial duplicates:
Emulsion PCR, background amplicon contamination and
signal cross-talk on the FTP sequencing device.

Usually, the low DNA-to-bead ratio minimizes the possibility
of loading a single bead with two distinct DNA molecules,
thereby generating mostly single-copy beads for sequencing
(Zheng et al., 2010). Conversely, many beads will remain
empty, and droplets containing several beads and a single
DNA molecule will therefore result in loading these beads with
identical copies of the original DNA molecule. The strongest
manifestation of overloading empty beads with identical mol-
ecules can be observed during unwanted emulsion breakage,
when the emulsions become chemically unstable during thermal
cycling and the micro-reactors fuse into larger droplets.

An amplicon contamination of ampliﬁed library DNA mol-
ecules from a previous sequencing run can also lead to duplicate
reads in following runs, but these types of duplicate errors can
normally be avoided by preventing cross-contamination of
sequencing library samples.

Signal duplicates are an effect of well-to-well cross-talk, where
strong signals ‘bleed’ into neighbouring empty wells (Briggs
et al., 2007). With the launch of the 454 Titanium chemistry,
well cross-talk has been minimized by metal coating of the
FTP well surface (Roche Applied Science, 2008).

Most likely, the main source of duplicates can be attributed to
the emulsion PCR step. As the beads are randomly distributed
on the plate, and the DNA on each bead is ampliﬁed and
sequenced independently, the ﬁnal length and error content of
the sequence read can differ, but in all cases, the starting position
of the read will be identical for all duplicates.

In contrast to artiﬁcial duplicates, duplicates can also arise
‘naturally’, i.e. by chance through sampling DNA molecules
that start at identical positions or in repetitive regions of a
genome. For genomic shotgun sequencing projects, there is a
correlation between genome coverage and the percentage of
natural duplicates. With increasing read density, the amount of
natural duplicates will also increase. In metagenomic datasets
of high complexity, i.e. in the absence of dominant species, the
percentage of natural duplicates should be very low. For meta-
transcriptomic samples, the discrimination of natural and artiﬁ-
cial duplicates is much more difﬁcult, as some highly expressed
RNAs will be sequenced much more often. For such datasets,
it is challenging to distinguish between artiﬁcial and natural
duplicates (Niu et al., 2010).

2.2 Benchmark dataset construction

To compare the performance of JATAC and cd-hit-454, we
generated three benchmark datasets, each consisting of a dataset
of (real) reads and information about duplicates within each set
of reads. We chose sequence datasets where a reference was avail-
able to accurately assess duplicate removal. Benchmarking on
reference-free metagenome datasets would have resulted in a
set of duplicate clusters and an expected duplication rate but
would give no indication of the accuracy of each method for
duplicate detection.

We used the GS Reference Mapper v. 2.6 (Roche Applied
Science, 2008) with default settings and processed the results
from the benchmark datasets in the following way: to precisely

get the correct alignment for the beginning of each read, we
independently mapped our data to the original and reverse com-
plement genome. The BAM ﬁle generated by the mapper was
converted into SAM format using samtools (Li et al., 2009) and
split into matches to the forward and reverse strands of the
genome, retaining only forward matches relative to the respective
reference (original/reverse complement). A subset of alignments
was identiﬁed by extracting only unique alignment start positions
and 16-nucleotide sequence preﬁxes, discarding alignments
where the initial part of the read was masked (i.e. having ‘H’
as the ﬁrst element of the ﬁeld). Clusters of duplicate alignments
were then extracted by grouping all reads with the same preﬁx
and aligned position. This procedure is for reference dataset gen-
eration only and not to be confused with the JATAC algorithm
(see Section 2.3).

For the ﬁrst benchmark dataset, we mapped 1270 325

Duplicate Cluster Size

Fig. 1. True duplicate cluster sizes from D.labrax benchmark dataset.
The biggest cluster contains 159 reads (see Fig. 2)

the corresponding (Sanger-sequenced) reference scaffold (Kuhl
et al., 2010). As a result, 35.80% of the 1270325 reads are
part of a cluster of at least two ﬁowgrams that map to the
same position in the reference genome. By subtracting one rep-
resentative per duplicate cluster, we estimated the overall dupli-
cate rate for D.labrax to be 20.18%. Of all duplicate clusters,
75% contain two, another 18% contain three and 5% contain
four flowgrams. The biggest cluster contains 159 ﬁowgrams (see
Figs 1 and 2). The genomic reference used for sea bass is incom-
plete leading to a possible over-estimation of artiﬁcial duplicates.
However, this does not introduce any bias in favour of any of
the clustering algorithms. In other respects, this dataset is ideal
as a benchmark, as the 454 sequences stem from the same indi-
vidual on which the reference is based while the reference was
constructed using a separate sequence set.

The second and third benchmark dataset consisted of two 454
GS Junior Titanium runs of an isolate of Escherichia coli
OlO4:H4, containing 137 528 and 135 992 reads, respectively.
This Shiga toxin producing strain was responsible for an out-
break of food poisoning in Germany in 2011 (Loman et al.,
2012).

2.3 Removal of duplicates with JATAC

We cluster ﬁowgrams rather than reads and operate solely in
ﬂow space (see Section 1.2). We take into account the 454 key
and quality trimming information included in the flow data ﬁles,
which means that only informative ﬁow values are used in the
duplicate removal algorithm [see Equation (3)].

2.3.1 Preclustering Our clustering algorithm involves calculat-
ing the pairwise distances of all ﬁowgrams. As this is computa-
tionally expensive on a dataset with more than a million
ﬁowgrams (typical 454 FLX Titanium run), we perform a pre-
clustering step that creates subsets of ﬁowgrams. Subsequent
clustering is only performed on these subsets, which means
that ﬁowgrams from different subsets cannot be identiﬁed as
duplicates of each other.

For preclustering, we use a varying seed of at least eight flows,
starting with the ﬁrst flow. For each of these flows, we only
take into account if the flow value was ‘negative’ (i.e. <0.5)
or ‘positive’ (i.e. 2 0.5, leading to at least one called base).

two ﬂow values [see Equation (2)]. Both ﬁgures show the probabilities related to the ﬁrst 10 ﬂow cycles; for details, see Balzer et al. (2010)

For preclusters containing >2000 ﬁowgrams, we gradually
increase this seed to further split them up. In addition, we
require ﬁowgrams within one precluster to start with the same
homopolymer length.

2.3.2 Distance measures To assess how similar two ﬁowgrams
are, we deﬁne a distance measure. This is similar to the distance
deﬁnition by Quince et al. (2011) but directly compares two
ﬁowgrams rather than one ﬁowgram with a perfect ﬂowgram
consisting of integers. We begin by applying Bayes’ Theorem
to calculate the probability for a homopolymer length being
equal to h when observing a ﬂow value f (see Fig. 3a):

P0111) - PU!)
P(f) '

The prior—the homopolymer length distribution P(h), the ﬂow
value distribution P(f) and the likelihood distribution P(f]h) are
taken from earlier analyses and consist of an average smoothed
distribution of D.labrax and E.coli ﬁowgrams, mapped to their
respective reference genomes and taking into account quality
degradation towards later ﬁow cycles. Determination of these
distributions has been described in detail in Balzer et al. (2010).
We argued earlier that the distributions are representative for
other species for homopolymer lengths up to 5, and they can be
downloaded from the flower website (http://biohaskell.org/
Applications/Flower). Furthermore, we excluded any overﬁtting
issues by demonstrating that the probability lookup tables
are more or less interchangeable without impacting the outcome
too much: when clustering D.labrax data with the use of a lookup
table created from E.c0[i ﬁow value distributions, our results
were equally good as when using the smoothed average distribu-
tion from D.labrax and E.coli (see Section 2.3.2).

If we assume that two ﬁowgrams, fga and fgb, are independent
from each other, then we can further calculate the probability
that the homopolymer lengths, ha,- and hm, are equal, given two

P(h|f) = (1)

ﬂow values, fa,- and ﬁ,,- (see Fig. 3b), the latter being ﬂow values
from fga and fgb in the same ﬂow (i.e. position) i.

P(hai = hbiIfaiaflai)
1 iffai orﬁ,,>5.5
1 if fa, and ﬁ,,-> 2.5 (2)

5
2 P01... = klfai) ' P(hbi = klfbi) else-
k:0

For reasons of algorithm robustness, we assign a ﬁxed
probability score of 1 if at least one ﬁow value is >5.5 or if
both ﬁow values are >2.5, thereby giving lower and better
resolved ﬁow values more weight in similarity calculations [see
Equation (3)]. The latter corresponds to the observation that
the most common sequencing error in 454 pyrosequencing
is due to incorrectly determined homopolymer stretches (see
Section 1.2).

In all other cases, we sum up the probabilities for the two ﬁow
values leading to the same homopolymer length 0, . . . ,5 to obtain
a realistic estimate for the two values resulting in homopolymers
of equal length. The ﬂow-position-wise calculation of probabil-
ities ensures that the two ﬂow values in question always relate
to the same nucleotide (see Fig. 2).

It is assumed that the ﬂow values of one ﬁowgram are not
correlated. The assumption is strictly speaking invalid owing
to the occurrence of carry forward and incomplete extension,
phenomena that the 454 software partly corrects for. Under
this assumption, we can deﬁne the distance a’(fga,fgb) between
two ﬁowgrams as follows:

 : =  P(l’lal‘ = hbivaiDﬂi))/(m _  _ 
i=1
m (3)
= Z —log(P(ha, = hbilfai,fbi))/(m _ (I _ 1))

with
l = max{left trimpoint(fga), left trimpoint(fgb)},
m = min{400, right trimpoint(fga), right trimpoint(fgb)},

the trimpoints being deﬁned by the 454 software.

2.3.3 Hierarchical ﬂowgram clustering Once we have deﬁned
our distance measure, we iterate through the ﬁles that contain
the preclustered ﬁowgrams (see Section 2.3.1) and perform
agglomerative clustering on one ﬁle at a time.

We now start with one ﬁowgram per cluster (i.e. each cluster
being a singleton) and calculate all pairwise distances between
ﬁowgrams. In each clustering step, the two clusters, which have
the smallest distance from each other, are combined into a new
cluster. Two updates are then performed: First, a consensus
ﬁowgram is determined for the new cluster by calculating the
per-ﬂow median of ﬂow values from all ﬁowgrams in this cluster
(quality-trimmed regions only). Second, the distances between
the new cluster and all other clusters are updated. We continue
clustering until all pairwise distances between clusters exceed a
given stringency threshold.

We experimented with different threshold settings for the
distance measure. Also, we only use the ﬁrst 400 flow values of
a flowgram [or all ﬁow values up to the lowest trimpoint, see
Equation (3)].

Our method of calculating a consensus ﬁowgram is based on
our observation that flow values in true duplicate clusters tend
to stretch out to one side of the integer for each ﬂow position
(see Fig. 2). Correspondingly, we calculate the median ﬁow value
per flow.

2.3.4 Output We have implemented three modes for determin-
ing a representative of a ﬁowgram cluster: ‘longest’, ‘best’ or
‘consensus’. Also, we provide both fasta and sff output to meet
the needs of a broad range of users. Choosing the longest read
from a cluster is straightforward; choosing the best read involves
calculating the squared sum of the ﬂow values’ distance to the
corresponding integers, normalized by flowgram length.
Obviously, ﬁow values that lie close to integers have a high ac-
curacy. The consensus ﬁowgram is the median flowgram that
previously has been used to (re-)calculate the distances between
clusters in the clustering algorithm. When using the consensus
option, the output of a cluster is therefore an artiﬁcial consensus
ﬁowgram of all ﬁowgrams in the cluster (at least if a cluster
contains more than one read).

2.4 Benchmark of methods

In general, when calculating the duplicate rate for a dataset with-
out comparing with a reference, the result strongly depends on
the stringency at which reads are regarded as being ‘similar
enough’. We ran JATAC on all D.labrax FLX Titanium and
E.coli Junior Titanium reads (see Section 2.2) and clustered
them at different stringency thresholds, the threshold being the
maximum allowed distance when combining two clusters [see
Equation (3)]. Also, we used the command line version of
cd-hit-454 (v. 4.6, Li and Godzik, 2006; Niu et al., 2010) to
cluster our shotgun data at different stringency settings (between
91% and 100%), where 98% is the default stringency in
cd-hit-454. Results are given in Table 1.

aThe clustering stringency corresponds to a sequence identity threshold for
cd-hit-454 and to a distance threshold for J ATAC. For the latter, a higher distance
corresponds to lower identity.

To evaluate to what extent our JATAC algorithm allows for
a more effective removal of artiﬁcial duplicates compared with
the nucleotide sequence-based cd-hit-454, we need a measure that
compares two sets of clusters. The Jaccard index

Jaccard := a/(a —I— b —I— c) (4)

can be used to compute the degree of similarity between the
real set of true duplicate clusters (from our reference, see Section
2.2) and the set of duplicate clusters identiﬁed by the respective
clustering algorithm. Those flowgram pairs that are correctly
identiﬁed as duplicates of each other are counted as a; those
that are not identiﬁed as duplicates, although they map to the
same position in the reference genome, are counted as b; and
those that are incorrectly identiﬁed as duplicates are counted
as c (see Fig. 4). The flowgram pairs b and c can vaguely be
understood as false positives and false negatives from a classiﬁ-
cation problem. However, the calculation of common classiﬁca-
tion indicators such as sensitivity and speciﬁcity would be
misleading here, as it is not sufﬁcient to identify a ﬁowgram as
an artiﬁcial duplicate of some other ﬁowgram, but it is relevant
which ﬁowgrams are clustered together.

JATAC outperformed cd-hit-454 on all three datasets, regard-
less of sequencing platform (GS FLX/Junior Titanium), actual
duplication rate or complexity (see Table 1 and Fig. 4) at similar

Estimated Duplicate Rate [°/o]

Fig. 4. Comparison of JATAC and cd-hit-454 duplicate clustering at different stringency settings and estimated duplicate rates surrounding the true
duplicate rate (vertical grey line). The range of parametrization lies between 0.02 and 0.10 (distance threshold) for JATAC and between 99% and 92%
for cd—hit-454 (identity threshold). Left: E.coli (Run 1). Centre: E.coli (Run 2). Right: D.labrax. For explanation of a, b and c pairs, see the text

estimated duplicate rates. We have experienced that a slight
overestimation of the true duplicate rate gives the best results
in terms of Jaccard index. This is true for both JATAC and
cd-hit-454.

For the second E.c0[i dataset, cd-hit-454 underestimated the
true duplicate rate even at a similarity threshold of 90% (data
not shown). This illustrates one caveat when using duplicate re-
moval tools such as JATAC or cd-hit-454, namely to determine
at which stringency the reads should be ﬁltered. However, the
cd-hit-454 identity threshold and the JATAC distance threshold
are not directly comparable. A JATAC distance of 0 does not
exactly correspond to a cd-hit-454 stringency of 100%, as it is a
lot more probable that two artiﬁcial duplicates share the same
nucleotide sequence than that they share the exactly identical
flowgram to the second decimal place. We have found that a
distance measure of 0.05 is a good starting point for duplicate
analyses resulting in a reasonable J accard index.

Additionally, we tested the effect of duplicate removal on
assembly performance of the E.c0[i genome. Therefore, the
two datasets were independently ﬁltered for duplicates (keeping
the longest read per cluster) and assembled together using
Newbler. The rationale behind this was to reduce assembly arti-
facts from low coverage. In addition, owing to the separate du-
plicate ﬁltering, we only removed a minimal amount of natural
duplicates. We scored the resulting assemblies for a limited
parameter set using Mauve assembly metrics (Darling et al.,
2011) and found no striking differences between JATAC and
cd-hit-454 ﬁltered assemblies. For both tools, the N50 increased
to 126 844 bp in comparison with the unﬁltered assembly with
an N50 of 106 414 bp (see Supplementary Material). We con-
clude that the high and identical N50 value obtained using
both approaches is likely to represent the highest possible
assembly continuity for the given dataset and read length
(Cahill et al., 2010).

3 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have quantiﬁed the room for improvements
when ﬁltering 454 pyrosequencing shotgun data for artiﬁcial

duplicates. We have successfully shown that, by the use of 454
flow data, a higher rate of artiﬁcial duplicates can be identiﬁed
than by using sequence data only. Artiﬁcially duplicated reads
can—apart from a generally higher processing and memory
requirement—lead for example to incorrect conclusions about
metagenomic dataset composition (Gomez-Alvarez et al., 2009)
or to biased quantiﬁcation in digital karyotyping experiments
(Dong et al., 2011). Another likely problem could be false posi-
tive single nucleotide polymorphism calls in the presence of
duplicated erroneous sequences. However, too stringent ﬁltering
might lead to an underestimation of abundance (Niu et al.,
2010).

Both JATAC and cd-hit-454 cannot distinguish natural from
artiﬁcial duplicates, but the percentage of natural duplicates can
be estimated from sequencing coverage by calculating the prob-
ability of multiple reads randomly starting at the same position
(Niu et al., 2010).

Although cd-hit-454’s estimated duplicate rates were compar-
able with JATAC’s estimations, the calculated cluster compos-
ition at similar duplication rates was of lower quality, manifested
in a lower J accard index. This is likely the result of JATAC being
better at handling homopolymer discrepancies and taking ﬁow
order into account, whereas cd-hit-454 is operating mostly on
global similarity scores. The distance calculation in JATAC is
a more robust way of ﬁnding duplicates, as it ﬁrst identiﬁes read
pairs with different homopolymer lengths at low distances.
Only with higher distance thresholds, reads with substitutions
are taken into account. This behaviour closely models the 454
sequencing chemistry where substitution errors are less common
than indels. Interestingly, the Jaccard index calculated from
running cd-hit-454 on the D.labrax dataset degraded much
faster around the true duplicate rate when compared with
J ATAC. This degradation could not be observed in the bacterial
datasets and is likely due to a higher probability of matching
unrelated sequences from a complex background. This phenom-
enon could also be relevant to metagenomic experiments of
highly diverse communities, where tools such as cd-hit-454
and JATAC are most useful. A comprehensive overview of

applications and effects of duplicate ﬁltering, e.g. on genome
assembly, can be found in Li et al. (2012).

JATAC’s improved duplicate identiﬁcation comes at a
computational price, and its speed depends on the number of
reads and the degree of duplication. JATAC takes up to several
hours to ﬁlter an sff ﬁle for duplicates, ~1.5h for a typical GS
Junior run.

We have also evaluated JATAC on IonTorrent ﬂow data, as
both platforms share the same data format (sff). Although it is
in principle possible to analyse ionograms using JATAC, the
underlying ﬂow data model has been optimized for pyrosequen-
cing data, which is why we do not recommend JATAC for
IonTorrent data in its present version.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The state of the art in promoter modeling for higher
eukaryotes is predicting not single transcription factor binding sites
(T FBSs), but their combinations. The new tool utilizes a previously
developed method of distance distributions of TFBS pairs. We
model the random distribution of distances and compare it with the
distribution observed in the query sequences. Comparison of the
profiles allows filtering out the ‘noise’ and retaining the potentially
functional combinations. This approach has proved its usefulness
as a filtering technique for the selection of TFBS pairs for promoter
modeling and is now implemented as a tool in R. As an input, it
can use the outputs of three different TFBS- and motif-predictive
tools (Gibbs Sampler for motifs, MatchTM and MEME/FIMO for
PWM-based search). The output is a list of predicted pairs on
overrepresented distances with assigned scores, P-values and plots
showing the distribution of pairs in the input sequences.

1 INTRODUCTION

Apromoter model is a combination of sequence elements modulating
transcription and characterizing promoters of a certain gene or
group of genes (Bailey and Noble, 2003). It is widely accepted
that in higher eukaryotes transcription factors (TFs) tend to
cooperate and act in most cases in a synergistic manner and
that it is this cooperation that confers the required speciﬁcity
of transcriptional regulation (Brazma et al., 1998; Fickett and
Wasserman, 2000). Therefore, co-regulation of genes entails the
existence of a characteristic combination of transcription factor
binding sites (TFBSs) in their promoters. Such combination can
be characterized not only by the set of TFBS, but also by the
distances between the constituents: the distance between the binding
sites should allow the cooperating factors to physically interact.
We suppose that the false positive predictions of the TFBS are
distributed randomly, whereas the distances in the functional TFBS
combinations are non-random.

The principle possibility to use distances as a distinguishing
feature was proven in the investigation of the behavior of real,
experimentally characterized TFBS pairs that have been shown

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to bind cooperating TFs. Such composite elements (CEs) are
combinations of two or more TFBSs, which provide synergistic
action of the TFs, qualitatively different from a purely additive
effect. The most comprehensive collection of composite elements
can be found in the TRANSCompel database (Kel-Margoulis et al.,
2002). We could show that each real CE can be characterized by
a ‘preferred’ distance or set of distances (Shelest, 2006). We have
also shown that the approach of distance distributions can correctly
identify the distance in real CBS.

2 METHODS

The underlying method of the distance distributions in TFBS pairs has
been proposed by E. Shelest (Shelest, 2006). Similar approaches have been
proposed by A. Konopka (Konopka and Smythers, 1987) and V. Makeev
(Makeev et al., 2003), but in both cases the authors consider the distances
only between neighboring binding sites, not taking into account all possible
pairs as it is done in our approach, and do not allow a shift (see below).
Brieﬂy, we suppose that positions of the false positive TFBS are random,
whereas the distances between the constituents of the functional pairs are not
random. Let us consider a model system with uniform random distribution of
points on a segment, where the points are representing the binding sites thus
neglecting the extension of TFBSs. We consider a sequence of the length L,
in which we ﬁnd MA sites of type A and MB sites of type B, where A and B
are being distributed randomly. It is evident that we then get M AMB pairs, the
maximal number of different combinations of positions being L2 (supposing
that different sites can occupy the same place). We want to estimate what
will be the distribution of the distances between sites A and B (A—B and
B—A are considered as the same pair). Since the distances in genuine TFBS
pairs are not rigid, we allow a slight shift of the sites, considering the pairs
on some distance interval, 6. Let f“ be the number of pairs on the distance
interval from d to d + 6. It is easy to show that:

fd,6=2(5+1)(L—d—%)%,lsdsL—1

f0,a=(2(6+1)(L—%)_L)%

(1)

Note that factor MAMB /L2 is the product of frequencies of TFBSs A and B,
which were predicted in one sequence. In the case of a set of N sequences
this factor must be changed to 1MAJ-MBJ/LZ. To estimate the error
of the predictions, we conducted computer simulations showing that the
standard deviation is o N \/fd—,3 (data not shown). The theoretically calculated
distribution of distances between random sites will be called further on
random distance distribution.

3 DISTANCESCAN OVERVIEW

The workﬁow includes four main steps: (i) identiﬁcation of
pairs; (ii) measuring the number of pairs in a distance interval;
(iii) calculation of random distance distributions for the sequence
sets; and (iV) selection of the overrepresented peaks.

DistanceScan

 

3.1 Identiﬁcation of pairs

Presently DistanceScan is working with three kinds of inputs: (i) the
results of a PWM-based TFBS prediction (MatchTM output; Kel
et al., 2003); (ii) the results of motif prediction (Gibbs Sampler
output; Thompson et al., 2003); and (iii) the results of two-step
prediction of motifs and corresponding PWM search (MEME/F IMO
output; Bailey and Elkan, 1994). DistanceScan considers all the
positions of all predicted TFBSs or motifs. Further on, it examines all
possible combinations of the positions, thus listing all possible pairs
in the sequence. The distances are measured between the centers of
the sites.

3.2 Counting the number of pairs at a certain distance
in sets of sequences

The number of pairs (figs) in the set of sequences in a distance
interval from d to d + 8 is directly counted for each d up to a
maximum speciﬁed and for 8 up to a maximum speciﬁed. d and
8 are deﬁned in special ﬁelds of the input form.

In some analyses, we do not expect that all sequences in the set
contain the TFBS combinations (not all data are reliable, etc.). For
such cases, the user has an opportunity to specify the minimal portion
of sequences with pairs.

3.3 Calculation of random distance distributions for
sets of sequences

The random distance distribution is calculated as described above,
based on the lengths of sequences and frequencies of TFBSs in the
considered set. Presently, the tool can work only with sequences of
equal lengths.

3.4 Decision for the overrepresentation

To characterize the overrepresentation of a pair, we deﬁne a score as:
S = 0:333 —fd’5)/od,5. This score shows by how much the observed
number of pairs is higher than the corresponding theoretical value,
but it does not characterize the statistical signiﬁcance of the peak.
For this, we provide P-Values assigned to each pair (and the
corresponding score). The P-Values are obtained by simulation
with 1000 iterations. A larger number of iterations would slow
down the counting. With 1000 iterations, the simulation results
can slightly ﬂuctuate between two repetitions of the same search.
This is non-critical, because the ﬂuctuations do not change the
order of magnitude, so they cannot inﬂuence the decision about
the signiﬁcance. (In the P-Value, not the value itself, but the order
of magnitude is informative.)

4 VALIDATION

The effectiveness of the approach was ﬁrst demonstrated by
the correct re-identiﬁcation of the real, experimentally proven
CEs (Shelest, 2006). Several most abundant sets of the
CEs from the TRANSCompel® Professional database, release
8.4, (http://www.biobase.de; Kel-Margoulis et al., 2002) were
chosen as positive training sets: AP-I—NF-KB (13 sequences),
AP—1—ETS (15 sequences), AP-1—NFAT (12 sequences), NF-KB—
C/EBP (10 sequences), NF—KB—IRF (10 sequences), NF—KB—Stat
(7 sequences), NF—KB—HMG I(Y) (9 sequences) and IRF—PU.1
(9 sequences). The sequences containing the corresponding CE were

prolonged around the reported binding sites by 300 bp to either
side from the center of the CE. DistanceScan correctly identiﬁed
all distances in the CE as overrepresented. Several long-distance
peaks registered by DistanceScan but not described in literature
can be considered as false positive predictions (FP rate being up to
10%). (It is questionable if these pairs are false positives or they are
not mentioned in literature because nobody checked the long-range
pairs.) We did not make special efforts to get rid of the long-distance
pairs, leaving this decision to the user.

To demonstrate the robustness of DistanceScan and to see the
variability of its results in dependency of the input ﬁles (Gibbs
Sampler, Match and MEME/FIMO outputs), we ran the analysis
on the same set of promoter sequences used as the input for the
three tools (see Supplementary Material). For the result to be more
illustrative, we used the sequences containing one of the known
CEs (NF-KB—IRF). It is obvious that the results of DistanceScan
depend on the rate of true positive predictions of the motif— searching
tools. Given that the true positive sites are correctly predicted, the
results of DistanceScan do not strongly depend on the type of the
input ﬁle. Although the exact width and the number of the peaks
differ for different inputs, DistanceScan correctly reidentiﬁes all but
one CE in each case [8 CEs out of 9 for the Match input (89%),
8 out of 8 for MEME and 6 out of 7 for Gibbs (85%)]. (For more
details, see Supplementary Material.) We have successfully applied
the tool to the prediction of the functional combinations of TFBSs in
modeling different pathways in higher eukaryotes and in fungi. We
could not compare the DistanceScan tool with another tool, since to
our knowledge there are no available tools speciﬁcally designed for
searching TFBS combinations on speciﬁc distances.

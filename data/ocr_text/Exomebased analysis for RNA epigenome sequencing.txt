ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fragmented RNA immunoprecipitation combined with
RNA sequencing enabled the unbiased study of RNA epigenome at
a near single-base resolution; however, unique features of this new
type of data call for novel computational techniques.

Result: Through examining the connections of RNA epigenome
sequencing data with two well-studied data types, ChIP-Seq and
RNA-Seq, we unveiled the salient characteristics of this new data
type. The computational strategies were discussed accordingly, and
a novel data processing pipeline was proposed that combines several
existing tools with a newly developed exome-based approach
‘exomePeak’ for detecting, representing and visualizing the post-tran-
scriptional RNA modification sites on the transcriptome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Despite the unprecedented prosperity in epigenetics studies of
DNA and histone modiﬁcations with next-generation sequencing
data (Bernstein et al., 2007; Thurman et al., 2012), the RNA
epigenetics remains a largely uncharted territory (He, 2010)
and has not beneﬁtted as much from the advancement in sequen-
cing technology until lately. Two recent studies of transcriptome-
wide mRNA m6A methylation (Dominissini et al., 2012; Meyer
et al., 2012) proposed a new powerful protocol (differently
named as ‘m6A-Seq’ and ‘MeRIP—Seq’), where mRNA is frag-
mented before the immunoprecipitation with anti-m6A antibody,
and the immunoprecipitated and input control fragments are
then sequenced for reconstructing transcriptome—wide m6A
methylation sites. This protocol in theory enabled the transcrip-
tome-wide unbiased study of a repertoire of >100 known
post-transcriptional RNA modiﬁcations (Cantara et al., 2011)
at a near single-base resolution, provided the corresponding
antibody is available. To unify the nomenclatures, we call this
protocol ‘FRIP-Seq’, which stands for “Fragmented RNA

ImmunoPrecipitation Sequencing’. FRIP-Seq is different from
RIP-Seq (Zhao et al., 2010), where full-length RNA is subjected
to immunoprecipitation for detection of protein—RNA inter-
action. In contrast, the immunoprecipitation of fragmented
RNA in FRIP—Seq enables the precise prediction of RNA modi-
ﬁcation sites on the transcriptome.

From a technological perspective, FRIP-Seq can be considered
a marriage of two relatively well-studied techniques: ChIP-Seq
(Kidder et al., 2011) and RNA-Seq (Garber et al., 2011). This
new technique brings a host of new computational challenges yet
to be adequately addressed. Next, we discuss brieﬂy the best
practice for FRIP-Seq data analysis.

Mapping and Filtering Short Reads: As FRIP—Seq sequences
mRNA, spliced aligners that allow reads to span exon—exon
junctions should be implemented. One important issue is the
widespread repetitive elements (Treangen and Salzberg, 2012)
in a broad range of species (~50% of the human genome)
that can lead to multi-reads (reads that could be mapped to
multiple genomic locations) and ambiguities in alignment. Of
the various existing strategies, the simplest yet effective way is
to exclude the multi-reads completely from the analysis. (See
Supplementary Material for detailed discussion.)

Fragment Length and Shifting Size: Currently, the most
popular RNA sequencing protocol (unstranded RNA library
and single-end sequencing) produces two shifted peaks on the
‘—I—’ and ‘-’ strands with a distance equal to the fragment
length, and this pattern is also observed in FRIP-Seq. To cor-
rectly predict the precise methylation sites, reads need to be
shifted by half of the fragment length or extended to the full
length towards the 3’-end. In case that the fragment length is
unknown, it may be estimated from the bimodal pattern
(Zhang et al., 2008) or the cross-strand correlation
(Kharchenko et al., 2008).

Peak Calling, Sequencing Bias and Control Sample: The detec-
tion of interaction sites has been formulated as the peak detec-
tion problem in ChIP-Seq (Micsinai et al., 2012; Wilbanks and
Facciotti, 2010). Different from the mild sequencing bias in
ChIP—Seq owing to nucleosome loss around the transcription
starting sites, FRIP—Seq suffers from the depletion at both 5’-
and 3’-end as a result of RNA fragmentation, considerable vari-
ations of expression levels for different genes, and most
importantly, the positional bias on the gene locus caused by
different isoform transcripts. Although ChIP-Seq peak calling
can be conducted in the absence of a control sample by

estimating the background from the neighborhood genomic
regions, FRIP-Seq peak calling does require a paired input
control sample of preferably fragmented RNAs before immuno-
precipitation as supposed to an immunoglobulin G control
sample.

Peak Annotation, Gene and Isoform Transcripts: The associ-
ation between detected RNA modiﬁcation sites and the speciﬁc
mRNA transcripts can be highly problematic. Recent study
shows that with an average of 10—12 isoforms per gene, most
genes tend to express multiple isoforms simultaneously (Djebali
et al., 2012). Since the sequencing read length is mostly <100bp,
isoform quantiﬁcation can be difﬁcult, not to mention calling
peaks for each individual isoform transcript. Nevertheless, an
mRNA methylation site may be uniquely associated with a tran-
script when the site spans across the nearest exon(s) that uniquely
belong to that transcript.

2 METHODS

We describe in the following a pipeline for the analysis of FRIP-seq
data that combines several existing tools with a novel exome-based
peak calling approach (Fig. 1a). In this pipeline, short reads are ﬁrst
aligned to the genome assembly with Tophat (Trapnell et al., 2009);
then, the resulting BAM ﬁles are ﬁltered, sorted and indexed with
Samtools (Li et al., 2009); in the last, RNA methylation sites are pre-
dicted with ‘exomePeak’, a MATLAB package that outputs exome-
based peaks (the genomic locus of RNA modiﬁcation sites) in the BED
format to facilitate the visualization in Integrative Genomics Viewer
(IGW (Robinson et al., 2011). See the Supplementary Material for an
example.

 

The proposed exome-based approach can be considered as projecting
transcriptome onto the genome, effectively avoiding the transcriptome
heterogeneity. The advantages of exome-based analysis are mainly in
two folds: ﬁrst, working on exome avoids the isoform-related ambiguity,
hence making all the computational operations (such as shifting, exten-
sion, smoothing, testing) straightforward. Second, it helps annotate the
detected methylation sites. Despite the increasing attention on studying
isoforms (Pearson, 2006), the gene convention is still at the center of most
annotations and descriptions. A detected RNA modiﬁcation site (on a
particular transcript) needs to be associated ﬁrst with a gene name before
its function can be predicted. As a result, the developed ‘exomePeak’
package calls peaks on pooled exons of a speciﬁc gene so that the
called peaks are automatically associated with that gene and hence its
related functions.

More speciﬁcally, exomePeak ﬁrst extracts and connects all the exons
of a speciﬁc gene and then detects peaks using a sliding window with a
conditional test that compares the means of two Poisson distributions
(Przyborowski and Wilenski, 1940). The peak enrichment is considered
for the IP versus control sample and for locus versus the entire gene in the
IP sample. The former indicates a peak enriched in the IP sample,
whereas the latter shows a locus-speciﬁc enrichment. The two P-values
are then combined by the Fisher’s or Stouffer’s method. ExomePeak
also swaps the IP and control samples to calculate False Discovery
Rate (FDR). (See the Supplementary Material for detailed discussion.)

3 RESULTS

Our pipeline was applied to the data from (Meyer et al., 2012)
and found at least one RNA m6A site on 9218 genes in
HEK293T cells at a signiﬁcance level of P—value: 10—5 (See
the Supplementary Material for more details). We then retained

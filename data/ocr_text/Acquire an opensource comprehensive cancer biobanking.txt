Abstract

Motivation: The probability of effective treatment of cancer with a targeted therapeutic can be im—
proved for patients with defined genotypes containing actionable mutations. To this end, many
human cancer biobanks are integrating more tightly with genomic sequencing facilities and with
those creating and maintaining patient—derived xenografts (PDX) and cell lines to provide renew—
able resources for translational research.

Results: To support the complex data management needs and workflows of several such biobanks,
we developed Acquire. It is a robust, secure, web—based, database—backed open—source system that
supports all major needs of a modern cancer biobank. Its modules allow for i) up—to—the—minute
‘scoreboard’ and graphical reporting of collections; ii) end user roles and permissions; iii) specimen
inventory through caTissue Suite; iv) shipping forms for distribution of specimens to pathology,
genomic analysis and PDX/cell line creation facilities; v) robust ad hoc querying; vi) molecular and
cellular quality control metrics to track specimens’ progress and quality; vii) public researcher re—
quest; viii) resource allocation committee distribution request review and oversight and ix) linkage
to available derivatives of specimen.

Availability and Implementation: Acquire implements standard controlled vocabularies, ontolo—
gies and objects from the NCI, CDISC and others. Here we describe the functionality of the system,
its technological stack and the processes it supports. A test version Acquire is available at https://
tcrbacquire—stg.research.bcm.edu; software is available in https://github.com/BCM—DLDCC/Acquire;
and UML models, data and workflow diagrams, behavioral specifications and other documents are
available at https://github.com/BCM—DLDCC/Acquire/tree/master/supplementaryMaterials.

1 Introduction

 

Access to high quality human cancer and matched normal tissues for
‘omics experimentation is critical for developing a better under—
standing of these diseases to design improved diagnostics and thera—
peutics. Human tissue biorepositories, or biobanks, can provide
tissues and associated participant, pathology and specimen data to
the researchers Who collected them and/or the scientific public

2007). Biobanking standards provide guidance and best practices on
how to collect, store and manage tissues to better assure high—quality
DNA, RNA, protein or other derivatives such as cell lines and pa—
tient—derived xenografts (PDX) for research (e.g. International
Society for Biological and Environmental Biorepositories [ISBER]
2012 Best Practices, http://bit.ly/1anuEU). As such many commer—
cial and some open—source software solutions exist to manage daily

repository operations and the inventory of a biobank. These prod—
ucts may not cover all aspects of biobanking operations outside of
the repository, such as derivative creation, specimen annotations,
quality control (QC) mechanisms or resource distribution. Some
commercial systems can be prohibitively expensive for biobanks
with limited financial resources. Two popular open—source options,
caTissue Suite and OpenSpecimen, which is an optimized version of
the caTissue codebase, have robust inventory support. Their
scope lacks some features for other important operational aspects of
a biobank, such as QC or oversight committee reviews of tissue
requests.

Applications for use in any type of biobank may not have out—0f—
the—box support for standard data elements and code sets appropri—
ate for cancers, which can reduce adoption of standard vocabularies
and data elements. The ability to dynamically add data elements in
electronic forms is a popular solution to capture custom data. If
these data entry forms are poorly designed, however, issues with
data interchange, standards compliance and getting data back out of
the system can arise. Further, many tools were not created to sup—
port a newer case for biobanks embedded within an ‘omics context,
which can range from collaborating research laboratories or cen—
ters generating genomic or proteomic data to Clinical Laboratory
Improvement Amendments (CLIA)—certified diagnostic laboratories.
For example, correctly modelling biomarkers, which can be ‘patient
level’ such as genomic information on germline variants; ‘case level’
with somatic variants within tumors; or even ‘aliquot level’ for tests
of protein expression or activation within a slide, is complex and re—
quires understanding of the biomedical domain along with data and
object modelling best practices.

Like many biomedical informatics groups, we were tasked with
supporting the informatics needs a variety of cancer biobanks that
vary in degree of centralization. These include national and Texas—
statewide federated banks such as the Texas Cancer Research
Biobank, local repositories of national banks such as the AIDS and
Cancer Specimen Resource, local Specialized Programs of Research
Excellence, core facilities and individual investigators’ collections.
Each of these groups had sufficiently similar needs that a central
platform could support them all. Many of these biobanks had mod—
est informatics support budgets and could not afford expensive soft—
ware solutions. All had shared needs for robust inventory
management, data QC/QA (quality assurance), tracking of specimen
requests and distributions, resource allocation committee support
(RACs), etc. In addition, many of these biobanks managed
specimens collected as part of clinical trials protocols, so any
informatics system would need to be able to interoperate with a
clinical trials management system. After carefully reviewing avail—
able commercial—off—the—shelf and open—source options in 2011, we
determined that at that time none fully met the requirements of these
biobanks.

To this end, we developed Acquire to manage the full lifecycle of
a specimen and its derivatives, distributions in different contexts
(e.g. to xenograft creation or genomic analysis cores) and requests.
Although Acquire supports dozens of biobanking workﬂows in vari-
ous facets of the lifecycle, it is not a monolithic system. Rather, it is
composed of several modules of software to facilitate updates and
even wholesale replacement of modules should newer software bet—
ter meet business needs at a lower cost in the future. A test instance
of Acquire that has been loaded with masked data is available at
https://tcrbacquire—stg.research.bcm.edu, login: reviewer1@re—
view.c0m, password: Change#1. The codebase, all models, deploy—
ment guides and customization notes for Acquire are freely available
at https://github.com/BCM—DLDCC/Acquire.

2 Methods
2.1 Application and databases

Acquire (current version 2.3.1) is a modular Java Enterprise Edition
6, web—based application built around an Oracle 11 g database for
structured data and a MongoDB store for image, pathology report
or other file uploads. Through the use of Hibernate, Oracle can be
swapped for other relational databases. The application runs in
JBoss 7 on Red Hat Enterprise Linux, though other Unix—based
operating systems (e.g. CentOS) may be utilized. Acquire is a modu—
lar system; caTissue Suite 1.2 was adopted as the biobank inventory
module, whereas all other modules were constructed by the authors.
caTissue technical specifications are described within its online de—
ployment guide (http://1.usa.g0v/1vRKzWO). For non—caTissue
modules, the system uses the model—view—controller architecture to
manage its various components. The model component of the sys—
tem uses Java Persistence API (JPA) for Entity persistence. The
views (i.e. the webpages) are rendered via a combination of AJAX
technologies and core JSF and Primefaces components for the user
interface. Acquire associates universally unique identifiers with
each participant and specimen, aliquot or derivative. Security is
maintained through restricting connections only to HTTPS connec—
tions and applying secure socket layer certificates to the application
host.

2.2 Security

To provide a seamless end—user experience for workﬂows that span
two or more Acquire modules, central authentication service (CAS)
was utilized for single sign—on to seamlessly integrate authentication
and authorization across Acquire’s modules. CAS supports end users
credentialed at the institution that hosts Acquire and roles. Users are
assigned permission—based roles for one or more biobank programs
or individual sites underneath a given biobank program. General
roles include: public scientist, non—PHI (protected health informa-
tion) technician, PHI viewing supervisor, RAC member and RAC
coordinator. Further granularity is added by individually adding
module permissions to each account to allow for users who fulfill
multiple roles within the system depending on the program. CAS
ties into hosting institutional active directory (AD) LDAP for au-
thentication and secondarily authenticates within Acquire’s local
Oracle database. All local passwords are stored in a salted hash.

2.3 UML models and documentation

The Acquire logical model was created using Enterprise Architect.
End—user documentation, README files for deployment and a de—
ployment guide were created in Microsoft Word or similar word
processing programs. All documentation is available at https://
github.com/BCM—DLDCC/Acquire/tree/master/
supplementaryMaterials/.

2.4 Web browser validation

Acquire has been optimized for Firefox 32+, Chrome 37+, Safari
7—1— and Internet Explorer 11—)— with validations performed in
BrowserStack.

3 Results

Though banking protocols and processes differ slightly among insti-
tutions, all must have processes for identifying potential subjects
and obtaining consent, collecting specimens and capturing data.

Acquire supports the full biobanking lifecycle for specimen and data
collection including:

' Participant data capture: consent, demographics and clinical
annotations

' Specimen data capture: collection, accession, storage, mainten—
ance, aliquoting or derivative creation and pathologic ﬁndings

' Data capture workﬂow management: status checks on which key
participant and specimen data are incomplete

' Data quality checks: reports to help identify data or specimen
collection quality problems

' Resource allocation: public researcher specimen requests, RAC
request reviews and specimen distributions

° Reporting: data mining for biobank personnel and restricted—ac—
cess searching for public researchers

Figure 1 maps the general biobanking operational activities in
these workﬂows to Acquire modules for data collection.

Because many biobanks collect PHI such as participant name, date
of birth and medical record number (MRN), secure authentication
and authorization are critical components for almost any biobanking
informatics system. Biobanks are often housed within a single institu—
tion that also acts as a coordinating center, though some have data
entry staff at affiliate organizations. Acquire accommodates these two
scenarios through a sophisticated single sign—on mechanism that is
able to first query the data coordinating center’s AD/LDAP and then
Acquire’s local database. Staff from the data coordinating center
therefore can use their organizational username and password,
whereas those at affiliate organizations use custom login information.

Authorized end users may login to the system or request support
via a customized CAS login screen. Information on how to add new
institutional logos and other branding is present within the
Deployment Guide. Successful logins result in the generation of a
session—based token that allows single sign—on to all modules of the
system. Because of this token, it is critical that end users log out
when not actively using the application. As an added security feature
the system logs end users out after periods of inactivity spanning
5min by default. From the login page, new users can request ac—
counts, and these requests are reviewed by Acquire administrators.

3.1 Dashboard homepage
Biobanks can be structured as geographically distinct collection and
repository sites functioning as a single unit (i.e. a federated

biobank), two or more collection sites with one central repository
site or a standalone biobank. Regardless of structure, biobanks can
support multiple protocols from different initiatives, meaning that
the same staff can have different roles and use more than one stand—
ard operating procedure (SOP). Acquire supports all of these diverse
structures or collection programs. Viewing permissions for each end
user are managed through the Admin console, where distinct privil-
eges can be assigned by each program and collection or repository
site. All end users, however, can view data in the Dashboard from
their programs (Fig. 2).

3.1.1 Announcements and alerts

Within the Dashboard section, the default selected tab is
Announcements, which shows alerts, news and other items that will
be shared with all users within a program. Announcements are
added by Acquire Administrators using a Microsoft Word—like
graphical user interface console in which special characters, colored
font or background and other modern standard word processing
features may be utilized. Administrators can access the console, cre—
ate new messages, manage existing messages and specify message ex-
piration dates at which time the message will automatically be
removed from the Announcements view from the Announcements

dashboard.

3.1.2 Collection overview

This tab contains a text—based summary health report for the bio—
bank, where sums of collected cancer specimens and matched nor—
mal are provided. For example, a major user group of Acquire, the
Texas Cancer Research Biobank (http://txcrb.org), had a collection
protocol in which tumor specimens and matched normals were har—
vested and immediately shipped to the sequencing facilities within
the Human Genome Sequencing Center at Baylor College of
Medicine or were processed for shipment to The Cancer Genome
Atlas (TCGA). Because this and other biobanks generally adopted
TCGA standards for using key data as a proxy for specimen quality
with regard to relative quality of the specimens for genomic and
transcriptomic experimentation, these standards are shown within
the Overview. These data include warm ischemia time below
60 min, percent necrosis and cellularity. Matched tumor and normal
pairs meeting these TCGA—like criteria are tallied. Specimen pairs
missing some key criteria (e.g. warm ischemia time not yet recorded,
but necrosis and cellularity data available), but for all available data

within acceptable parameters are tallied as potentially meeting
TCGA-like criteria.

3.1.3 Leaderboards

The Dashboard also contains two tabs for Specimen by Collection
Site and Specimen by Disease. The Collection Site tab provides over—
view reports for each of the program’s biobank specimen collection
sites and any collection subsites. For each parent and child collection
site, the tallies of matched tumor/normal pairs for the data elements
within the Collection Overview are shown for that particular site
along with the total collections in the last 1 and 2 weeks. The tem—
poral data were added to measure each site’s collection progress and
help identify possible operational issues before they become major
bottlenecks for the biobank. The Disease Site tab’s reports break the
Overview data down similarly, but unlike the Collection Site tab,
the Overview data elements are grouped by ICD—O—3 anatomic axis
values, such as breast or brain.

3.2 QuickViews

Underneath the summary Dashboard, end users may view data and
reports within one of several QuickViews, each of which provide
more tailored information than the Dashboard. These views, shown
as vertical tabs in Figure 2, are shown only for end users with appro—
priate permissions and, with the exception of summary Graphical
Reports, the data displayed within each QuickView are limited to
the biobank sites to which the end user has privileges.

3.2.1 Graphical reports

Frequently investigators require graphs for presentations or grants.
Graphical reports summarize the Dashboard reports for specimens
collected by disease type, specimens collected at each biobank site
and the rate of collection for the program for milestone tracking.

3.2.2 Specimen updates: workﬂow management
Well—annotated biospecimens must be collected and processed as
part of a complex workﬂow that spans different roles such as a

principal investigator (PI), consent nurse, pathologist or their proxy,
biobank supervisor and biobank technician. Specimen Update
QuickViews help PIs and other biobank staff identify at what step in
the process a specimen is by displaying status flags of procedural
steps that are still unmet to help ensure efficient operations. Status
ﬂags include Awaiting Path, warm ischemia time, Prior Tx (treat-
ment), NA (nucleic acids) Lab Qualified and whether or not the spe—
cimens were shipped to one of several types of facilities. To remove
these flags, end users can click specimen (labels and barcode) and
participant data in any row to automatically open up that record in
Acquire’s caTissue Suite and perform the necessary data entry steps.

3.2.3 QC and assurance reporting

A biobank must be able to assure its users that the specimens within
the bank are correctly categorized and of good quality for down—
stream experimentation. Without mechanisms for QC/QA, tens of
thousands of dollars can be spent to collect specimens of limited util—
ity to scientific research and assay validation. A series of reports
were created that display key quality metrics about specimens in the
repository including the collection site or subsite, disease diagnosis
(ICD—O—3 for these cancer specimens), anatomic site and initial
quantity of tumor.

For the All TCGA Qualified Specimen report, these metrics in—
clude data on specimens that meet the TCGA requirements of per-
cent necrosis, percent tumor nuclei and warm ischemia time.
Potentially Qualifying reports show specimens that may meet the
full TCGA criteria but are missing at least one required value.
Molecular quality reports include RNA integrity number (RIN) val-
ues for RNA quality measurements and gel images for establishing
DNA quality. Each record in this report is linked to the parent speci—
men. The parent specimens are annotated with warm ischemia time
which, when reviewed in conjunction with RNA and DNA quality
metrics, can assist a lab manager in determining whether the stand—
ards for specimen quality are being met. For these and other reports,
end users can view additional details on the participant by clicking
on any ‘MRN’ record. ‘MRNs’ can be any unique patient identifier,
and these data are linked to the appropriate participant page in

caTissue. For most reports, end users may select among biobank
sites to which they have viewing privileges. For all reports, one can
sort all columns, filter data in any column by entering text into the
Google—like search fields located within the heading of each column
and export reports into Excel.

QC reports by Site contain details about the specimen quality
such as percent necrosis, whether the patient received prior
treatment, specimen type, amount of available specimen, etc.
Each record in this report links back to the specimen or participant
detail page within caTissue. Perhaps most importantly for
biobanks integrated tightly with genomics facilities, there is a flag to
indicate whether each specimen has been shipped to an ‘omics
core facility. The second report, NA Lab Quality Results by
Site, provides information to biobankers on the quantity and rela—
tive quality of extracted DNA or RNA with links to caTissue as
before.

3.2.4 Pathology

Though caTissue has the capacity to dynamically add new data
elements and forms, these data are stored in a manner that renders
them difficult to extract and exchange in an interoperating system.
Some pathologists or pathologists’ assistants prefer to directly enter
data into Acquire, whereas others utilize biobank staff as their data
entry proxies. The Pathology QuickView satisfies both scenarios by
allowing end users with pathology privileges to add staging and
grading data, information on percent cellularity and necrosis of the
specimen and pathology reports.

3.2.5 Resource allocation committee

Specimen and data distribution oversight generally is managed
by a RAC consisting of experts in biobanking—related fields
and often a patient advocate. Acquire provides full elec—
tronic support for public researchers to request specimens, for re—
cording all documents relating to these requests and
for demonstrating that the biobank is sharing tissues per its charter
(Fig. 3).

Once a public researcher has submitted a request as described
within Section 3.4, the RAC module notifies the RAC coordinator
of the request via email. The coordinator can login to Acquire to
view and manage the request in their RAC Inbox. The coordinator
may amend the application as needed on behalf of the requestor to
add pertinent information for the RAC review. Each application is
assigned by the Coordinator either to the full RAC or a subset of
RAC members as an expedited review. The RAC members assigned
to the request receive an email from the system that includes a sum—
mary of the application and a link to comment or vote on the re—
quest in Acquire. In some cases, RAC members have informally
discussed requests with collaborators ahead of time and essentially
provided informal pre—approval to those parties. The ability to vote
directly via email supports rapid processing of this type of Expedited
request. For other Expedited or Full RAC review requests, RAC
members can respond to automated emails with questions and
comments, which are injected into the request record at the bottom
of the application in Acquire. If the RAC approves the request
application, the status is updated to Approved, and the coordinator
can select specimens to distribute per that biobanks SOPs.
Utilizing the distribution protocols in the caTissue module, biobank
site/s staff is notified of what must be distributed and to
whom. The application is then removed from the RAC Inbox and
placed in the RAC Archive for future reporting. If the RAC rejects

the application, its status is updated to Rejected and moved to the
Archive.

3.3 Data miner

Any member of the biobank, regardless of their role, can search their
program’s biobank data (excluding PHI) via the Data Miner mod—
ule. Members can specify one or more values for a variety of search
parameters spanning participant, tumor specimen and matched nor—
mal data elements. The miner reports the number of matching speci—
mens and allows end users to view and download the retrieved
results or to modify their query.

3.4 Specimen availability and access requests

For public researchers to request specimens and data, they must self—
register for public user account from the Acquire login page.
Requests are reviewed by the Acquire administrator. Approved pub—
lic users receive an automated email notifying them that an account
has been created on their behalf. Upon login, public researchers can
access only a limited public version of Data Miner, which contains a
small subset of the query data elements within the Miner tool. This
specimen availability tool retrieves the total number of specimens
matching the search criteria so that requesters can determine if they
want to submit a formal electronic application for specimen and
data access. The data elements included within this query interface
were selected to provide an overview of available specimens in the
biobank while respecting stakeholders’ rights to protect the intellec—
tual capital within the data.

If the requester elects to submit an online application, the form
records their contact information; detailed project information
including funding agency, award number and Institutional Review
Board (IRB) approval; detailed specimen criteria; requested material
type criteria such as frozen tissues, formalin-fixed paraffin-
embedded slides, DNA, etc.; declarations of any financial conflicts
of interest; and electronic certification of the acceptance of the bio—
bank’s policy and procedures. Requesters can save incomplete
forms, upload supporting documents and submit completed forms.
Once submitted, they can track the application’s RAC review status,
upload supporting documentation and view prior requests.

3.5 caTissue suite

This application and its management of core participant demo—
graphics; specimen collection, accession, management and distribu—
tion; and capacity for adding additional data elements as ‘dynamic
extensions’ is described in detail within its online user documenta—
tion and training modules, http://1.usa.gov/1GHE9Qi. For Acquire,
the software has had patches and updates applied to correct browser
incompatibility issues with Firefox and to include additional bulk
operation templates. Acquire not only displays hyperlinks to speci—
men and subject pages within caTissue from its Dashboard and
QuickViews, but also has a hook to caTissue from study sites. For
the reports and links to function properly, the collection site values
within caTissue must match those within Acquire’s reporting
modules.

3.6 Shipping forms

Acquire generates summary forms to accompany biospecimens that
are shipped to genomics, PDX and cell line creation facilities.
Biobank staff can add specimen to a shipping form, which is saved
within Acquire. Upon completion, the specimens’ available quantity
is updated and ﬂags are set to indicate that the specimens have been
distributed. Forms can be printed for inclusion in shipment

Fig. 3. Acquire’s workflow management of resource allocation to public researchers. The Public Researcher executes a Specimen Availability search in their
Acquire dashboard to determine if suitable specimens exist within the system (at left). The Public Researcher must then fill out an electronic request form (at left),
which are submitted for review by the RAC Coordinator (at top). The Coordinator can reject requests or assign them to RAC Members for either full or expedited
reviews. Assigned RAC Members can electronically ‘discuss' and vote on requests from their RAC console (at right). Alternatively, these comments and votes can

be captured by responding to emails from Acquire. The RAC Coordinator will review votes and formally approve or reject requests (at bottom). For approved re-
quests, the Coordinator attaches pertinent documentation such MOUs and MTAs. Researchers can create new requests at any time (at left)

containers and/or electronically sent to the core facility. Shipment
forms in Acquire are based upon XML templates, and these were
tailored for shipping specimens or nucleic acid derivatives to a gen—
omic sequencing facility and tissue microarray creation core. By
updating the XML template found within the Acquire codebase on
GitHub, one can create new Shipping Forms.

4 Discussion

4.1 Utilization of Acquire for biobanking processes
by role
Biobank operational processes (Fig. 1) begin with a consent staff
person meeting with potential participants to obtain informed con—
sent. Participant demographic and consent data are then entered
into the caTissue module (Section 3.5). When specimens are col—
lected, they are delivered by consent staff to biobanking technicians
for accessioning and processing. The consent staff or biobank super—
visor may later receive a pathology report and enter key abstracted
pathology data in the Pathology module (Section 3.2.4). Because
there may be a gap of several weeks between initial consent and re—
ceipt of additional information from the hospital or clinic, this staff
member can take advantage of Acquire’s Specimen Updates module
(Section 3.2.2) to quickly search for a participant’s record and fol—
low a link to the correct data entry page in Acquire.

As biobanking technicians receive specimens from consent staff,
they log specimen accession information, any biobank identifiers

and the storage location in the caTissue module (Section 3.5).
Technicians may create aliquots or derive new types of specimens
such as DNA or RNA from the ‘parent’ specimens. Each aliquot and
derivative data can be hand entered or, when processing larger num-
bers of these samples, imported in batch via bulk operations within
caTissue.

Some protocols generate genomic, transcriptomic or other ‘omics
data from collected specimens. Biobank technicians or supervisors
can select specimens for distribution to an associated core facility
within the Quality Assurance reports module (Section 3.2.3) and
add these specimens to a Shipping Form (Section 3.6). When core fa—
cility staff receives the specimens, they can compare barcodes and
labels to the expected data based in the form’s manifest to confirm
the identity of each specimen. As DNA or RNA derivatives are cre—
ated for ‘omics experimentation, quality metrics and other data are
added within Specimen Updates by core staff (Section 3.2.2).

PIs frequently serve on RACs (Fig. 3), but they also must oversee
the collection progress of their biobank(s). These individuals can
utilize the reports within the Dashboard (Section 3.1) to monitor the
overall ‘health’ of the bank.

4.2 Acquire’s impacts on biobank value

The biobanking field has struggled to incorporate additional mech—
anisms to improve the quality and utility of collected specimens.
Acquire adds value by providing a mechanism through which the
collection site can monitor molecular quality metrics DNA quality
and RNA RIN numbers alongside specimen quality metrics such as

percent cellularity, warm ischemia time and images of slides that
underwent pathological review. Poor quality metrics often point to
a need to adjust SOPs or to ensure that staff is accurately following
protocol. These integrated data therefore allow biobank staff and
leadership to identify areas in need of improvement. Within the
Texas Cancer Research Biobank (TCRB) for example, the NA QM
QC report identified a group whose collections had consistently
poor RIN values due to high warm ischemia time. TCRB leaders
modified the method of collection in a way that did not alter stand—
ard of care, but dramatically improved RNA quality.

Lack of discoverability of specimens represents a serious issue
within biobanking, leading to low numbers of distributions.
Collection of tissues that are unused is neither fiscally practical nor
does it maximize participants’ contributions to science through their
specimen donation. Acquire’s public researcher interface facilitates
specimen discoverability by public scientists and provides a stream—
lined method of applying for those specimens online.

Both of these features and others set Acquire apart from other
commercial and open—source biobanking informatics solutions.
Table 1 summarizes current key features of Acquire including
caTissue and all other modules relative to other popular biobanking
products. We annually review biobanking products to determine
whether lower cost, complete solutions exist. First, we define a set
of requirements based on our biobanks’ needs, and then we review
the ISBER MarketPlace for inventory solutions, speak with col—
leagues and identify products at conferences. We then review prod—
uct documentation to determine ‘best of breed’ based on our
requirements. For those, we speak with the vendor and if possible
current customers, and view product demonstrations. Further, we
estimate the total cost of ownership based upon our total number of
end users, active protocols and support needs. For commercial prod—
ucts, licensing models and costs can differ dramatically.

In our last annual review, we started with a list of two open—
source and seven commercial products. Initial documentation re—
views compared with our requirements narrowed this list to two
open source (caTissue and OpenSpecimen) and three commercial
(BioFortis, TissueMetrix and LabVantage) products that might best
fit our needs. Perhaps not surprisingly, the three commercial prod—
ucts shared a substantial number of feature sets. Ultimately, our ana—
lysis showed that in our environment with hundreds of active end
users, hundreds of thousands of biospecimens and dozens of active
collection protocols, Acquire is the best overall option.

The products in Table 1 were selected as examples of open—
source software (caTissue), lower cost commercial general banking

software that had few features meeting our requirements
(Freezerworks) and higher cost commercial software better tailored
to cancer biobanks (BioFortis) we reviewed. Summary data for
caTissue can be generally applied to OpenSpecimen and data for
BioFortis to other cancer commercial products. The three systems
represent the full spectrum of licensing costs, though licensing mod—
els and features for any product can change with time. Our annual
review process is useful for any biobanking informatics group, but
due to potential differences in institutional requirements, factors
contributing to license cost (e.g. number of end users, specimen or
protocols) and budget, different products will be more or less at—
tractive to different organizations.

4.3 Utilization of Acquire’s models

Each Acquire module was created based upon input from personnel
representing at least three different biobanking programs, some of
which themselves were federated biobanks with diversity in process
at individual sites. These models are general enough to be useful to
most human cancer biobanks, though the utility of most of the
workﬂows and much of the technical models is not limited to
human tissues. Rather they can also be of use to any specimen col—
lection effort. Software development groups are free to utilize the
models and workflows for Acquire and its modules. UML models
were compared with the more abstract Clinical Data Interchange
Standards Institute’s BRIDG model (Fridsma et al., 2008) and an
important future goal will be to harmonize the full Acquire model
with the domain model.

4.4 Minimal resources required to adopt acquire

The system is freely available under an LGPL license, but adoption
or adaptation of any software program has some associated person—
nel and hardware requirements. Though one could run CAS,
caTissue and Acquire on one machine, with virtualization, it is pos—
sible to maintain them separately. At least one other server is
required for its database, per N—Tier best practices. At a minimum,
an institution would need personnel to fill the following roles: Linux
system administrator with at least 10% FTE; database administrator
5%; and a programmer/analyst at 25% FTE, with new custom en—
hancements, new features and other changes requiring higher levels
of effort. Acquire’s main back—end database is Oracle 11g, though a
programmer/analyst familiar with JPA can take advantage of its
platform neutrality to substitute the database of choice. Ideally, the
systems would be backed up nightly to a remote location and the

database archived at least once a week, representing additional stor—
age and IT support costs that vary by institution. If potential adopt—
ees are not familiar with the technical workings of caTissue, it is
recommended that they purchase an annual support contract from a
support service provider.

4.5 Future directions

In the post—TCGA era, biobanks must exhibit value to participants
and researchers, instead of solely focusing on quality (Simeon-
Dubach and Watson, 2014). Those banks embedded within an
‘omics research context must be able to support the next generation
of research questions. Already the system can support longitudinal
studies and specimens whose quality does not match that of TCGA’s
stringent criteria. Acquire will change its leaderboards to expand to
include criteria such as molecular biomarkers or datasets, completed
minimal clinical and pathological data entry and other key elements
determined by our multistate user community. We are currently as—
sessing interoperation with OpenSpecimen as a second inventory
module option within Acquire. Other enhancements slated for the
next 2 years of development include:

4.5.1 Clinical and pathological enhancements

We are incorporating a Clinical Annotation module to capture rich
clinical and pathological annotations. Out—of—the—box forms will in-
clude sociogeographic data, self and familial history of cancer, pa-
tient risk factors and follow—up—all of which are generally useful
for any cancer. Some pertinent data, however, cannot be generalized
across tumor types. Because breast cancer is a complex and fairly
well—described set of diseases and one of the most common cancers,
we built out detailed forms to capture pathologic data, treatment
regimens/exposures, patient—level biomarkers (e.g. serum, germline
mutations, etc.), and biospecimen molecular biomarkers as a pilot.
The new Annotations module is undergoing internal user acceptance
testing now and will be available in Acquire’s next release slated for
Spring 2015 . A subsequent release to enhance form administration
component will follow. The intent with these annotations is not be
to create an exhaustive collection of knowledge on the participants
that recapitulates an electronic health record, but to select for infor—
mation that might have the most research utility.

Many clinical research protocols collect participants’ specimens
for correlative or other purposes. As participants are consented to
trials and specimens collected at specified time points within a trial’s
calendar, data can be entered into the CTMS, exported as an Excel
report from the CTMS and imported via bulk operations in
Acquire’s caTissue module. Different clinical trials management sys—
tems expose data to varying extents. Some, such as Forte’s OnCore,
have a small application programming interface (API) for consum-
ing data about subjects that have enrolled in trials. These services in-
clude demographics, a protocol identifier, associated study
participant identifiers and other key information. An important goal
for the next release will be to create an Acquire API that consumes
OnCore’s service for protocols that have a collection component.
OnCore is the highest prioritized CTMS because of its high adoption
rates among cancer centers and reputation as being a ‘gold standard’
system within the community.

4.5.2 Improved PDX and cell line support

Though it is possible to manage PDXs and cell lines within Acquire
now, enhancing support for tracking passages of tumors/cells and
the quality assurance data that are often collected every few pas—
sages is an important goal for Acquire.

5 Conclusions

Acquire is a secure, open—source, web—based database that serves as
the hub of many biobanks and has broad enough support for general
biobanking workflows that it can be adopted and adapted by other
biobanks. Heavy emphasis is placed upon oversight of biobanking
workﬂows and QC within the system. Fully electronic support of
specimen request, review and distribution of specimens and data for
approved requests is included. Links to broad, concisely written con—
sents and materials transfer agreements developed by biobanks such
as the Texas Cancer Research Biobank complement Acquire and are
also freely available for use by other cancer biobanks.

ABSTRACT

Summary: The semantic comparisons of Gene Ontology (GO)
annotations provide quantitative ways to compute similarities
between genes and gene groups, and have became important basis
for many bioinformatics analysis approaches. GOSemSim is an
R package for semantic similarity computation among GO terms,
sets of GO terms, gene products and gene clusters. Four information
content (IC)- and a graph-based methods are implemented in
the GOSemSim package, multiple species including human, rat,
mouse, fly and yeast are also supported. The functions provided
by the GOSemSim offer flexibility for applications, and can be easily
integrated into high-throughput analysis pipelines.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Gene Ontology (G0) is becoming the de facto standard for the
annotation of gene products. The G0 consortium annotates gene
products with terms from three orthogonal ontologies organized
as directed acyclic graphs, laying the foundation for quantitative
semantic comparisons. Several metrics have been proposed to
measure the semantic similarity between GO annotations, and have
been veriﬁed in terms of the correlations with sequence similarity
(Lord et al., 2003) protein—protein interactions (Xu et al., 2008), and
gene expression proﬁles (Sevilla et al., 2005). The G0 semantic
similarity provides the basis for functional comparison of gene
products, and therefore has been widely used in bioinformatics
applications, such as protein sub-nuclear localization prediction (Lei
and Dai, 2006), gene function prediction (Tao et al., 2007) and
cluster analysis of genes (Bolshakova et al., 2005; Wolting et al.,
2006).

Two typical approaches to measure semantic similarity of GO
terms are information content (IC)- and graph-based measures.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
lThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.

The IC—based measures depend on the frequencies of two GO terms
involved and that of their closest common ancestor term in a speciﬁc
corpus of GO annotations, such as the UniProt Knowledgebase.
Three IC—based measures, Resnik’s (Philip, 1999), Lin’s (Lin, 1998)
and Jiang and Conrath’s (Jiang and Conrath, 1997) have been
introduced from natural language taxonomies by Lord et al. (2003)
to compare gene products in early time. On the basis of Resnik’s
and Lin’s deﬁnition, an IC—based measure has also been presented
by Schlicker et al. (2006). Considering that the speciﬁcity of a
GO term is usually determined by its location in the GO graph,
Wang et al. (2007) proposed a graph-based strategy to compute
semantic similarity using the topology of the GO graph structure.
In the Wang’s method, the semantics of GO terms are encoded into
a numeric format and the different semantic contributions of the
distinct relations are considered.

Several online tools for semantic similarity measurement of
gene products are available at present, such as G—SESAME
(Wang et al., 2007) and FuSSiMeG (http://xldb.fc.ul.pt/rebil/ssm/).
To facilitate large-scale analysis, two freely available software
packages, GOGraph (Lord et al., 2003) and GOSim (Frohlich
et al., 2007) implementing classic IC—based methods for semantic
comparison of GO terms have also been developed. Here, we present
an R package named GOSemSim to compute semantic similarity
among GO terms, sets of GO terms, gene products and gene clusters,
providing both IC— and graph-based methods.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The GOSemSim is developed as a package for the statistical
computing environment R and is released under the GNU General
Public License within Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004)
project. GOSemSim depends on the annotation data GO.db provided
by Bioconductor to obtain the ancestors of GO terms and their
relations. The information content is species speciﬁc and calculated
from Bioconductor annotation packages org.Hs.eg.db, org.Rn.eg.db,
org.Mm.eg.db, org.Dm.eg.db and org.Sc.sgd.db for human, rat,
mouse, ﬂy and yeast, respectively.

Considering that existing approaches performs differently under
different circumstances (Pesquita et al., 2009), four IC—based
(Resnik’s, Lin’s, Jiang and Conrath’s and Schlicker’s) and one
graph-based (Wang’s) semantic similarity measure algorithms
mentioned before are selected to be integrated in GOSemSim,
and can be selected by setting the ‘method’ parameter of the
package functions to ‘Resnik’, ‘Lin’, ‘Jiang’, ‘Rel’ and ‘Wang’,

respectively. The Resnik’s, Lin’s and J iang and Conrath’s algorithms
are the most common semantic similarity measures used with G0
(Pesquita et al. , 2009). Several assessment results had shown that the
Resnik’s measure had consistently high correlation with sequence
similarity (Lord et al., 2003; Mistry and PaVlidis, 2008; Pesquita
et al., 2008) and gene co-expression (Sevilla et al., 2005). By
using a best-match average combination strategy, Pesquita et al.
found that J iang and Conrath’s measure had the highest correlation
with sequence similarity (Pesquita et al., 2009). The Schlicker’s
measure had been found to perform better than Resnik’s measure
in distinguishing orthologous gene products from gene products
with other levels of sequence similarity (Schlicker et al., 2006).
The Wang’s measure had also been shown to produce more accurate
results than Resnik’s measure in clustering gene pairs according to
their semantic similarity (Wang et al., 2007). The details about the
semantic similarity measure algorithms used in GOSemSim can be
found in the user’s manual (Supplementary Material 1). The G0 used
in measurement can be restricted by assigning the corresponding
parameter to ‘BP’ (biological process), ‘MF’ (molecular function)
and ‘CC’ (cellular component).

3 FUNCTIONS AND EXAMPLES

Six functions are provided by GOSemSim package. The function
goSim, mgoSim, geneSim and clusterSim can compute the semantic
similarity among GO terms, sets of GO terms, GO descriptions of
gene products and GO descriptions of gene clusters, respectively.
The functions mgeneSim and mclusterSim are designed to calculate
the similarity scores matrix of a set of genes and gene clusters.

The output value of the basic function goSim is between 0 and 1.
The higher the value obtained more the similarity between them.
For example:

> goSim("GO:0004022","GO:0005515",measure="Wang",
ont="MF")
[1] 0.252

The function mgoSim is designed to compute the similarity of two
GO terms lists, such as

> gol=c("GO:0004022","GO:0004024","GO:0004174")
> go2=c("GO:0009055","GO:0005515")

> mgoSim(g01, g02, measure="Wang", ont = "MF")
[1] 0.299

By mapping gene products to GO annotations, functions geneSim,
mgeneSim, clusterSim and mclusterSim can be used to measure the
semantic similarity among gene products. Gene IDs and species
are needed for the measurements. For human, rat, mouse and ﬂy,
the Gene IDs refer to Entrez Gene IDs, while for yeast, the Gene
IDs refer to ORF identiﬁers from Saccharomyces Genome Database
(SGD), for example:

> geneSim("1019","4831",ont="CC", measure="Wang",
organism="human")

$geneSim

[1] 0.627

$G01

[1] "GO:0000307" "GO:0005829" "GO:0005634"
"GO:0005654"

$G02

[1] "GO:0001726" "GO:0005634" "GO:0030027"

The functions mgeneSim, clusterSim and mclusterSim are
especially designed for large-scale analysis. Suppose we have a
group of genes (here, we use a random sample set of Affymetrix IDs
as an example) and want to cluster the genes based on their functions.
First, we call the function mgeneSim to compute the pairwise GO
semantic similarities of these genes:

> 1ibrary(hgu95av2.db)
> sample_probes <—sample(ls(hgu95av2ENTREZID),40)
> sample_genes <—sapp1y(sample_probes,function(x)
hgu95av2ENTREZID[ [X] ] )
> sim<—mgeneSim(sample_genes,ont="MF",
organism="human",measure="Wang")
> sim[1:3,1:3]
379 10584 8625

379 1.000 0.117 0.210
10584 0.117 1.000 0.428

8625 0.210 0.428 1.000

Then, we can use hierarchical cluster function hclust of the stats
package to cluster these gene products based on semantic similarities
of their GO annotations. After cutting the cluster tree into discrete
cluster groups, we can use clusterSim and mclusterSim function to
measure the similarities among gene clusters, for instance:

> myc1<—cutree(hr, h=max(hr$height)/2)
> subcls <— sapply(unique(mycl),function(x)
names(myc1[myc1==x]))
> c1usterSim(subcls[[3]],subcls[[4]],ont="MF",
organism="human", measure="Wang")
[1] 0.177
> mclusterSim(subcls, ont="MF", organism="human",
measure="Wang")
[,1] [,2] [,3]
[1,] 0.531 0.235 0.129
[2,] 0.235 0.602 0.224
[3,] 0.129 0.224 0.848

4 CONCLUSIONS

The measurements of the semantic similarities for GO annotations
facilitate users to infer relationships among genes, and therefore
is becoming one of the important bases in many bioinformatics
analysis methods. The GOSemSim package implement ﬁve
classic approaches for GO annotations-based semantic similarity
measurements, and provide useful functions to offer ﬂexibility for
typical applications. The package can be easily integrated into
pipelines for high-throughput analysis, such as gene expression
data mining, protein interactions validation and miRNA-regulated
network interpretation.

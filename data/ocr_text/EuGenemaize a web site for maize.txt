ABSTRACT

Motivation: A large part of the maize B73 genome sequence is now
available and emerging sequencing technologies will offer cheap and
easy ways to sequence areas of interest from many other maize
genotypes. One of the steps required to turn these sequences into
valuable information is gene content prediction. To date, there is
no publicly available gene predictor specifically trained for maize
sequences. To this end, we have chosen to train the EuG ne software
that can combine several sources of evidence into a consolidated
gene model prediction.

1 INTRODUCTION

The B73 maize genome sequence is now available (Schnable
et al., 2009). We can anticipate that next generation sequencing
technologies will soon supply a deluge of genomic data from
other maize genotypes. Therefore, in addition to the annotation
provided by the maize sequence consortium for the B73 genotype,
the community will also need a tool for the annotation of maize
genomic sequences produced from other genotypes.

To date, the www.maizesequence.org web site provides the
Filtered Gene Set including annotation of 32 540 gene models
(RefGen_V1), based on biological evidence. However, no tool is
provided to annotate personal sequences yet.

Fgenesh (Salamov and Solover, 2000) was among the ﬁrst
ab initio gene prediction softwares available for maize while
it was trained for monocot species. Combiner softwares like
EuGene (Foissac and Schiex, 2005) can improve their own
ab initio prediction results by integrating information from
sequence alignment software, from splice site and translation start
site prediction software or from other gene ﬁnder algorithms,
thereby improving prediction quality. EuGene uses probabilistic
Markov models to discriminate coding sequences from non-coding
ones, or genuine splice sites from false ones. Gene models generated
by EuGene are associated with a score based on all the available
information. In order to calculate the weight for each information
source and to calibrate its ab initio prediction module, EuGene was
trained using a maize-curated gene sequence set built in this study.

2 METHODS

To build cognate gDNA/cDNA pairs, 6700 (4000 BAC) maize genomic
sequences and 5500 full-length cDNA (FLcDNA) were extracted
from the NCBI databases and ﬁltered using an automatic pipeline
designed on-site. First, cDNA sequences were trimmed using Seqclean
(http://www.tigr.org/) and the Univec database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih
.gov/VecScreen/UniVec.html). Then cDNA redundancy was removed based
on an ‘all against all’ cDNA BLAST analysis (E-Value threshold 1e-100).
Non-redundant cDNAs were then aligned onto the BAC sequences using
BLAT (Kent, 2002). To avoid ambiguous alignments such as cDNA mapping
to several gDNAs, a spliced alignment was computed using GenomeThreader
(Gremme et al., 2005), and the best alignment was retained as the correct
gDNA/cDNA pair. Next, for each gDNA/cDNA pair, the coding sequence
was determined from an alignment with the corresponding protein from
maize or rice. Each of the 247 validated pairs was manually checked before
inclusion into the training set.

The third-party prediction softwares used by EuGene maize are
SpliceMachine (Degroeve et al., 2005; donor and acceptor splicing site
prediction), GenomeThreader (spliced alignment), BlastX (Altschul et al.,
1997; protein alignment) and optionally Fgenesh (ab initio gene prediction).
The sequence database used for prediction contains 69 306 maize FLcDNAs
from GenBank, 20 508 rice mRNAs from RAde, 342 491 maize PlantGDB-
assembled Unique Transcripts (PUT) from PlantGDB, 593 maize proteins
from Uniprot/SwissProt, 19836 rice proteins from RAde and 26 751
Arabidopsis proteins from TAIR (see the EuGéne-maize web site for an
updated listing of sequence resources and corresponding full references).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Gene prediction assessment

The training gene set was compared with 330 curated genes
(Haberer et al., 2005) and was found to be representative of
maize genes (Table 1). To assess EuGene-maize, we performed

gene prediction on eight BACs (AC211245, AC190915, AC204601,
AC186187, AC211225, AC193983, AC200414 and AC194325) for
which manually curated annotations of 42 genes are available
(Liu et al., 2007). We compared these results (Table 2) with
predictions from GeneBuilder (Liang et al., 2009) B73 RefGen_V1
(Schnable et al., 2009). Nearly all loci are detected by both
predictors; however, GeneBuilder missed several mono-exonic
genes. Exon-level assessment shows that the GeneBuilder is more
sensitive yet less speciﬁc than EuGene. A gene containing 18 exons
was incorrectly split by both tools (GRMZM2G119544_E01 and
GRMZM2G119496_E01). Another gene (GRMZMM2G086779)
containing four exons was split by EuGene only. In two
other instances (GRMZM2G520535 and GRMZM2G177098)
GeneBuilder incorrectly merged two adjacent genes, whereas
EuGene failed only once.

3.2 Web access

EuGene-maize is available online (see Availability section).
Genomic sequences can be masked prior to the prediction step.
Masking is computed by RepeatMasker (A.F.A. Smit et al.,
unpublished data) using the mips Repeat Element Database
(Redat 4.3) (Spannagl et al., 2007). RepeatMasker low complexity
masking option is disabled. The user may also submit, if available,
the output ﬁle from the Fgenesh software (version 2.4). The gene
prediction computation takes <5 min for a 200 kb genomic sequence
and >1 h if the RepeatMasker option is enabled.

The results are compressed into an archive ﬁle and e—mailed to
the user. The archive contains the parameters and options used
for prediction, the submitted sequence, the masked sequence (if
relevant), the annotation ﬁle (gff, gff3 and fasta format) and a HTML
ﬁle that allows results to be displayed by a web browser.

ABSTRACT

Summary: SensA is a web-based application for sensitivity analysis of
mathematical models. The sensitivity analysis is based on metabolic
control analysis, computing the local, global and time-dependent
properties of model components. Interactive visualization facilitates
interpretation of usually complex results. SensA can contribute to
the analysis, adjustment and understanding of mathematical models
for dynamic systems.

Availability and implementation: SensA is available at http://gofid.
biologie.hu-berlin.de/ and can be used with any modern browser. The
source code can be found at https://bitbucket.org/floettma/sensa/

1 INTRODUCTION

The understanding of complex systems and their dynamics has
greatly improved with mathematical modelling. With models, the
dynamics of system components can be analysed, hypotheses
can be tested and the behaviour of the system can be predicted
in different conditions or in response to perturbations. These
predictions guide future experiments, which can save money
and time.

To mimic the behaviour of the real biological system, model
parameters have to be tuned based on biological observations. In
this process, it is Vital to test the effects of changes in parameter
values on the behaviour of the system. This test is often referred
to as sensitivity analysis. Sensitivity analysis measures the change
of a speciﬁc system property (e.g. a steady state concentration,
reaction ﬂux or the amplitude of oscillations) in response to
changes in parameter values. Thus, it shows how sensitive the
system is towards a particular parameter. It can also be inter-
preted as fragility or robustness analysis of the system.

Here, we implement sensitivity analysis as deﬁned by meta-
bolic control analysis (MCA). MCA deﬁnes coefﬁcients that
describe the effect of inﬁnitesimal changes of parameters on
system properties, like reaction ﬂuxes or variable concentrations
(Heinrich and Rapoport, 1974; Kacser and Burns, 1973).
Classical MCA is limited to models in steady state, but Ingalls
and Sauro extended the theory to look at the time-dependent
changes of sensitivities as well (Ingalls and Sauro, 2003). MCA
and its extension provide a sound theoretical framework for sen-
sitivity analysis.

SensA is a software to compute local, global and time-depend-
ent sensitivity coefﬁcients in models implemented in the Systems
Biology Markup Language (SBML) (Hucka et al., 2003), provid-
ing information about three distinct levels of sensitivities.

First, to analyse the inﬂuence of a parameter (or substrate) on
an isolated reaction rate, we calculate local sensitivity coefﬁcients
(or elasticities). Second, to assess the effect of a perturbation of a
parameter or reaction rate on the steady state ﬂuxes or concen-
trations, we compute global response and control coefﬁcients. In
contrast to elasticities, control and response coefﬁcients take into
account the structure of the reaction network. In contrast to
local coefﬁcients, they can be useful to understand the impact
of individual reactions or components on the behaviour of the
system as a whole.

However, in case a dynamic system shows a transient response
or oscillations (e.g. signalling cascades or the cell cycle), the in-
ﬂuence of parameters may change over time. It can be of par-
ticular interest to analyse at what time a system is most sensitive,
for example in cancer chronotherapy (Levi et al., 2010). Third, to
provide an option to capture such effects, we compute time-
dependent concentration response coefﬁcients (TDCRCS)
(Ingalls and Sauro, 2003). They allow to trace how sensitivities
change over time.

Here, we present SensA, an online tool for sensitivity analysis.
SensA is completely web-based, and requires no installation at
all. A clear focus on sensitivities and a modern Javascript—based
front-end make the tool easy to use. It extends sensitivity analysis
as compared with standard modelling software [e. g. Copasi
(Hoops et al., 2006) or JW S online (Olivier and Snoep, 2004)]
to include time-dependent sensitivities as well. Thus, SensA
offers the most complete set of sensitivity analysis we know of.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The calculations are implemented in Python and are available
as open source software (see Availability and implementation).
We provide details on the numerical computation of the sensitiv-
ities on the project’s website.

The front-end is implemented in meteor.js and can be accessed
using a standard compliant browser. Users can upload models
in SBML format, and every model is analysed in its own pro-
cess on our server. Thus, several models can be analysed at the
same time.

On upload of a model, the analysis starts and the different
sensitivities are displayed with reactive vector-graphics (.svg) as
soon as they become available (Fig. 1A). A user can already
investigate some results while more time-consuming calculations
may still be running. Additionally, we provide a model overview
and an option to simulate the time courses of model variables to

with respect to changes in pRaf over time, as calculated by our software

enable users to check that the model works correctly. Graphics
and data (.csv) can be downloaded for further processing.

All uploaded models and generated data can be deleted by the
user. Also, the analysis software is usable as command-line tool
on a local computer through its command-line user interface.

3 DISCUSSION

To demonstrate the main analysis and the corresponding type of
results a user can expect, we analysed a model for the extracel-
lular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) cascade from Schilling et al
(2009), accessible on the Biomodels database (BioModels ID:
BIOMD0000000270). The model comprises 33 variables and 39
parameters, resulting in 2376 different TDCRCs. A schematic of
the model topology and a selection of concentration time courses
and computed TDCRCs are shown in Figure 1B. Looking at the
structure of the model and the concentrations, it becomes clear
that a phosphorylation of pRaf leads to a number of phosphor-
ylations further downstream. Using SensA, we are now able to
observe the inherent relationship between changes in the concen-
tration of pRaf and pErkl and ppErk2 over time.

Moderately complex models already produce a large number
of TDCRCs that can be problematic to Visualize. To address
this, we implemented interactive graphics with a selection
matrix and a plotting area. The matrix shows all possible
TDCRCs. When the user hovers over a speciﬁc coefﬁcient, the
line is transiently displayed in the plot. This serves as a quick and
easy way to scan a large number of coefﬁcients. Also, the user
may select to plot all, none or the 10 most extreme coefﬁcients.

4 CONCLUSION

Sensitivity analysis in general is an important tool in many areas
of modern systems biology and is often used to understand the
growing complexity of models. Especially TDCRCs can give an

interesting perspective on signalling models, and are an often
cited method in the ﬁeld (original paper has ~l40 citations).
Nevertheless, studies that actually use it are rare (Petelenz-
Kurdziel et al, 2013). We provide SensA to close the gap be-
tween this sophisticated analysis and a comprehensive way to use
it. This can enable modellers to use the method and make the
results more accessible.

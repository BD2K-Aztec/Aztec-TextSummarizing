Abstract

Motivation: Knowledge-based and co-expression networks are two kinds of gene networks that
can be currently implemented by sophisticated but distinct tools. We developed stringgaussnet, an
R package that integrates both approaches, starting from a list of differentially expressed genes.

1 Introduction

Analysis of genes differentially expressed (DE) depending on a con-
dition has become a standard procedure in current biology.
However, identification of biologically relevant DE genes is far from
being trivial. Yet efficient prioritization of DE genes is an essential
step before undertaking rate-limiting wet lab experiments (Smyth,
2004). In this regard, the network theory appears as a powerful
framework. The aim is to connect genes (the nodes) by means of
their interactions, the edges (Dong and Horvath, 2007). These inter-
actions may be based on prior knowledge, curated and stored in
databases, or extracted from the experimental dataset, e.g. using
coexpression information (Cotney et al., 2015; Lin et al., 2015;
Verfaillie et al., 2015; Xue et al., 2014). Sophisticated but distinct
tools are available to implement either one of these approaches sep-
arately. We introduce stringgaussnet, an R package that allows
inferring gene networks starting from a list of DE genes by integrat-
ing both of these approaches with ease and flexibility.

2 Initial objects and example data

Stringgaussnet requires two data frames that store, one the expression
measurements, the other DE gene statistics. They are combined to cre-
ate an object of class DEGeneExpr. Expression data are usually nor-
malized for efficient correlation computation. In the example data,
we provided transcriptomic profiles of monocyte-derived dendritic

cells from nine patients affected with ankylosing spondylitis and 10
healthy controls. Transcriptomic data were obtained using micro-
arrays. Gene expression levels in patients and in controls were then
compared with LIMMA (Talpin et al., 2014). We limited the number
of DE genes to 75.

3 String network construction

Stringgaussnet allows constructing a protein—protein interaction net-
work using the DE gene names (Ensembl IDs or HGNC symbols) with
the use of the STRING API with specific URIs (Franceschini et al.,
2013; Szklarczyk et al., 2015). The number of additional nodes can be
set by the user, and these are useful to detect indirect relationships be-
tween input genes. The default value is twice the number of initial DE
genes. Different species can be curated, the default being Homo sapi—
ens. This process generates an object of class STRINGNet, a network
with multiple edges depending on sources and combined scores. One
can select specific sources of interactions and filter on the scores given
by STRING. Stringgaussnet can calculate a new combined score, based
on the algorithm provided for STRING version 8 (http://string-stitch.
blogspot.fr/20 1 0/03/combining-scores—right-way.html) .

4 Short paths from string networks

The generated network can be large and dense. As a STRINGNet
object, it can be reduced by computing shortest paths between genes

of a user’s list. To this aim, combined scores S are converted to dis-
tances D for each node pair i with D,: max(S,-) + 1 — S,, where
max(S,-) is the maximum of S over all interactions. Shortest paths be-
tween each pair of nodes are computed with the Dijkstra’s algo-
rithm. This method creates an object of class ShortPathSTRINGNet,
with unique edges giving distances and intermediates as attributes. It
is also possible to filter edges on D.

5 SlMoNe network inference

Alternatively, Stringgaussnet can help infer Gaussian networks from
expression data, using the R package SIMoNe (Chiquet et al.,
2009). Default parameters are set for easy use. The number of edges
that is selected is the mean of the number of edges corresponding to
maximal AIC and BIC scores. By default, the algorithm computes a
network under two models, with or without clustering constraints,
and picks edges common to both models. Stringgaussnet performs a
Spearman’s test for each inferred edge. This generates an object of
class SIMoNeNet, a network of unique edges including theta,
Spearman’s rho and P-value as attributes. One can filter on edge at-
tributes, notably on Spearman’s rho.

6 WGCNA approach to compare results

SIMoNe is a powerful tool to infer unsupervised Gaussian networks.
For comparison, we also propose the use of the popular WGCNA
package (Langfelder and Horvath, 2008). Stringgaussnet performs a
Spearman’s test between all pairs of genes. The respective rho coeffi-
cients are converted to similarity scores a: (1 + p)/2 that are then
converted to adjacency scores A = 1/(1 + e — oc'”'(o — 0.5)) where a is
the soft power threshold; its default is set to 8. A method helps ad-
just this parameter by plotting relationships between A and rho.
Then a filtering step is done using a threshold t, A being superior to
t or inferior to 1 — t. Dissimilarity and module computation are not
implemented, because the main purpose is to compare with SIMoNe
results. The network is saved in a WGCNANet class object. A func-
tion is provided to compare networks inferred by SIMoNe and
WGCNA, with a Venn diagram displaying the numbers of shared
and specific edges, and a series of plots showing correlation coeffi-
cients of selected interactions.

7 Adding annotations to genes

While networks are being generated, it is possible to add gene anno-
tations as node attributes. They are of two kinds, including genomic
localization and brief gene description, using the biomaRt R

Fig. 1. Stringgaussnet operating principle. Starting from expression data and
DE gene statistics, both semantic and Gaussian networks can be inferred and
then exported into Cytoscape. The package environment is circumscribed by
the dashed rectangle

package, and cellular component terms, using the GO.db package.
In addition, genes are ranked depending on the localization of their
protein product, from nuclear, the most relevant, to extracellular, to
plasma membrane and last to cytoplasm.

8 Automatic network creations in one step

An overlay of functions allows the user to create multiple networks
in only one step, with all options configurable in the same method.
One can create multiple Gaussian networks from the same
DEGeneExpr object, depending on a grouping factor and for a given
list of genes. The package then allows comparing networks inferred
for multiple levels of the factor, and for the same DE genes list. One
can create an object of class MultiDEGeneExpr, a list of
DEGeneExpr objects. Then, both kinds of networks, semantic or
Gaussian, can be generated for each data set and stored in a
MultiNetworks object.

9 Automatic export to Cytoscape

In addition to be exported in standard file formats, generated net-
works can be imported automatically from R objects into
Cytoscape, without requiring an intermediate language (Cline et al.,
2007). This is performed in an operating-system independent man-
ner through the plugin cyREST (http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cyr-
est). Stringgaussnet proposes predefined styles for displaying the
exported networks; they can be easily customized in Cytoscape or
directly in the package.

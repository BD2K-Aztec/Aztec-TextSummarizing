ABSTRACT

Summary: The annotation of membrane proteins in proteomes is an
important problem of Computational Biology, especially after the de-
velopment of high-throughput techniques that allow fast and efficient
genome sequencing. Among membrane proteins, transmembrane
,B-barrels (l'MBBs) are poorly represented in the database of protein
structures (PDB) and difficult to identify with experimental approaches.
They are, however, extremely important, playing key roles in several
cell functions and bacterial pathogenicity. TMBBs are included in the
lipid bilayer with a ,B-barrel structure and are presently found in the
outer membranes of Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and
chloroplasts. Recently, we developed two top-performing methods
based on machine-learning approaches to tackle both the detection
of TMBBs in sets of proteins and the prediction of their topology.
Here, we present our BETAWARE program that includes both
approaches and can run as a standalone program on a linux-based
computer to easily address in-home massive protein annotation or
filtering.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transmembrane ,B-barrel proteins (TMBBs) are important pro-
teins that cross the lipid bilayer with a series of ,B-strands
arranged in a cylindrical geometry and forming a structure
that resembles a barrel (Schulz, 2000). Although all living organ-
isms have transmembrane proteins organized into all-or helical
bundles, TMBBs are presently found in the outer membranes of
Gram-negative bacteria, mitochondria and chloroplasts. Despite
their relevance, few TMBB structures are available at atomic
resolution from Gram-negative organisms [about 0.1% of all
the structures from Gram-negative organisms in the protein
database (PDB)].

Several computational methods have been developed to pre-
dict TMBBs from protein sequences. Two prediction problems
can be addressed: (i) TMBB detection in genomes (Bigelow et al.,
2004; Casadio et al., 2003; Freeman and Wimley, 2010; Gromiha

and Suwa, 2006; Hayat and Elofsson, 2012; Remmert et al.,
2009; Savojardo et al., 2011), and (ii) the prediction of
protein topology (Bagos et al., 2004, 2005; Bigelow et al., 2004;
Fariselli et al., 2009; Hayat and Elofsson, 2012; Martelli et al.,
2002).

Here, we present BETAWARE, a tool based on machine-
learning approaches to detect TMBBs in large sets of proteins
and predict their topology. BETAWARE is available under GPL
license as a standalone program, which is particularly well-suited
for large-scale genome analyses. For the prediction of TMBB
topology, it has been shown on comparative analyses that
approaches based on grammatical modelling are the best per-
forming (Fariselli et al., 2009; Hayat and Elofsson, 2012),
while for the detection of TMMBs in a set of proteins, the
best-performing method is based on N—to-l Extreme Learning
Machines (ELM) (Huang et al., 2006; Mooney et al., 2011;
Savojardo et al., 2011).

2 METHODS

Detecting TMBBs in large sets of proteins is like ﬁnding a needle in a
haystack. To address this problem, we used the previously developed
method based on N—to-l network encoding (Mooney et al., 2011) and
ELM training algorithm (Huang et al., 2006). This method is the best
performing on this task as compared with the most recent approaches
(Savojardo et al., 2011 and Supplementary Table S1). Once a protein
sequence is predicted as putative TMBB, we applied a Grammatical
Restrained Hidden Conditional Random Field (GRHCRF) model to
predict the protein topology (Fariselli et al., 2009). The model used is
the same as previously described (Fariselli et al., 2009), but here it has
been retrained on a larger set of proteins.

2.1 Usage and program requirements

BETAWARE is written in pure Python to allow high compatibility.
However, it has been explicitly designed to run on Unix/Linux systems
(although it would be not too difﬁcult to modify it for other operating
systems). The BETAWARE program requires that the following
packages are installed in the system: (i) python v2.x (tested on 2.6 or
later), python argparse library, python numpy and scipy libraries
(under Linux debian/ubuntu you have just to type on a single line:
sudo apt-get install python-numpy python-scipy
python-argparse). Once the software is downloaded and uncom-
pressed, it is possible to run it directly moving into the BETAWARE
root directory and typing the command:
$> . /predBeta. Sh FASTA_FILE PROFILE_FILE

where predBeta.sh is a simple bash script, which takes as
arguments a ﬁle containing the sequence to predict in FASTA format
and its corresponding sequence proﬁle in a separate ﬁle. An example of a

In the basic setting, BETAWARE works in two steps. First, it predicts
with N-to-l ELM a score for a protein to be a TMBB. Therefore, in case
the protein is predicted as TMBB, it assigns the putative topology using
the GRHCRF. The output includes the sequence name present in the
FASTA ﬁle, the sequence length, the TMBB prediction (yes or no) and
possibly the topology prediction. When the topology is assigned, the
output also displays the posterior probability of the label for each se-
quence position (from ‘a’ 2 highest probability to ‘j’ 2 lowest probability,
see output example). BETAWARE allows a more advanced control using
directly the python script betaware . py. In this case, several options are
possible, such as forcing the prediction of the topology even if the detec-
tion program does not recognize the sequence as a TMBB (-t option),
changing the threshold for allowing a more or less stringent detection
criterion (-s option), changing the order of the sequence proﬁle columns
(the order of the residues in the sequence proﬁle, -a option) and directing
the output on a ﬁle (-0 option).

3 BETAWARE PERFORMANCE

It has been shown that BETAWARE is one of the best-perform-
ing methods on the problem of the detection of TMBB in large
set of proteins (Savojardo et al., 2011). This is also conﬁrmed
when it is compared with more recent approaches achieving a
Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient and a F l-score of 0.82 and
0.81, respectively (Supplementary Table S1, Supplementary
Material). In particular, BETAWARE appears effective in redu-
cing the number of false positive predictions as compared with
other available methods, as indicated by the positive predicted
value (PPW of 0.92 (Supplementary Table S1). The same picture
holds also when BETAWARE is applied to genome analyses
(Supplementary Table S3, Supplementary Material).

The number of TMMBs available at atomic resolution
increased since we introduced the predictor based on GRHCRF
(Fariselli, 2009). Here, we retrain the BETAWARE-topology
component on a larger set of proteins (for more detail see BTM
in Supplementary Material). BTM is a dataset consisting of 54
non-redundant TMBB structures (and topology) obtained by
merging OPM (Lomize et al., 2006) and PDBTM (Tusnady
et al., 2005). BETAWARE performance in cross-validation on
BTM is reported in Table 1. Compared with previous results on
a smaller dataset (F ariselli et al., 2009), the overall accuracy is
lower. This is probably owing to the fact that BTM contains
more difﬁcult topologies, and it is conﬁrmed by the fact that
when BETAWARE is trained and tested in cross-validation on
a more recent, but smaller, dataset (BOCTOPUSset), its

performance is comparable with those obtained by the best-per-
forming methods on this task as indicated by a protein overlap of
0.72 (Supplementary Table S2).

4 CONCLUSION

In this application notes, we present BETAWARE, a stand-
alone program that can detect with high reliability TMBBs in
large sets of proteins and that furnishes a state-of—the-art per-
formance in the task of the prediction of TMBB topology. The
program can be installed on a Linux-based machine and can be
used in-house for wide-screening applications.

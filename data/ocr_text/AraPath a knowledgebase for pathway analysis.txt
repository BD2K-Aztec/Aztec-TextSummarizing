ABSTRACT

Summary: Studying plants using high-throughput genomics technol-
ogies is becoming routine, but interpretation of genome-wide expres-
sion data in terms of biological pathways remains a challenge, partly
due to the lack of pathway databases. To create a knowledgebase for
plant pathway analysis, we collected 1683 lists of differentially ex-
pressed genes from 397 gene-expression studies, which constitute
a molecular signature database of various genetic and environmental
perturbations of Arabidopsis. In addition, we extracted 1909 gene sets
from various sources such as Gene Ontology, KEGG, AraCyc, Plant
Ontology, predicted target genes of microRNAs and transcription fac-
tors, and computational gene clusters defined by meta-analysis. With
this knowledgebase, we applied Gene Set Enrichment Analysis to an
expression profile of cold acclimation and identified expected func-
tional categories and pathways. Our results suggest that the AraPath
database can be used to generate specific, testable hypotheses re-
garding plant molecular pathways from gene expression data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The coverage and quality of gene set databases are critical to the
effectiveness of all pathway analysis programs. The molecular
Signatures Database (MSigDB) is a collection of gene sets for
pathway analysis in mammals using Gene Set Enrichment
Analysis (GSEA; Subramanian et al., 2005) or other similar
methods. The most recent version (3.0) of MSigDB contains
6769 sets of genes from various sources. In addition to existing
annotation databases such as Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al.,
2000) and KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2006), lists of differentially
expressed genes were manually collected from hundreds of pub-
lished gene expression studies of genetic and chemical perturb-
ations. Inclusion of these gene sets in the database enables the
detection of co-regulation of genes similar to those induced by
chemical and genetic perturbations reported in the literature.
This will be useful in identifying shared regulatory mechanisms
(Ge, 2011), complementing existing tools such as AtCAST

(Sasaki et al., 2011), HORMONOMETER Wolodarsky et al.,
2009) and Sample Angler (bar.utoronto.ca).

To facilitate pathway analysis for plant genomics, we sought
to construct a database similar to the MSigDB, so that the vari-
ous pathway analysis programs could be easily used to analyze
plant genomic data. Recently, (Schuler et al., 2011) extracted
gene sets from several sources including GO, KEGG,
TRASPATH and TRASFAC, so that they could use GSEA
within the GeneTrail software. In this study, we compiled a
large, publically available gene sets database by extracting
information from existing databases and by collecting gene ex-
pression signatures from the literature. We focused on
Arabidopsis thaliana, a widely studied plant model organism
with large amounts of genetic, biochemical, physiological and
genomic data available. This resource will form the basis for
making similar resources for other plants and even more distant
species such as Plasmodium falciparum (malaria parasite).

2 METHODS

As most authors deposit their raw genomics data into public repositories,
we searched for publications reporting microarray studies of Arabidopsis
in Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/) and
ArrayExpress (www.cbi.ac.uk/arrayexpress/). The full text of the papers
and their supplementary materials were retrieved and manually curated.

Gene IDs from various sources were converted to NCBI gene symbols
whenever possible. AGI (Arabidopsis Genome Initiative) IDs were used
for genes without ofﬁcial gene symbols. The conversion is based on the
Arabidopsis gene information at NCBI (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/gene/
DATA/GENE_INFO/Plants/). We also used the gene aliases table at
NCBI and TAIR to convert a small number of genes.

The web site was assembled using a combination of the Python pro-
gramming language, Django web framework, MySQL, JavaScript and
html.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We succeeded in extracting pathways or functional categories
information from various sources to construct a knowledgebase
for pathway analysis in Arabidopsis thaliana (Table 1). Our data-
base includes information from several public databases like
Gene Ontology, KEGG and AraCyc. We also included predicted
miRNA target genes from six studies (see data ﬁle for refer-
ences). Conﬁrmed and unconfirmed targets of transcription fac-
tors were obtained based on Yilmaz et al. (2011). The Plant
Ontology (PO) Consortium created controlled vocabularies and
association of genes with the anatomical site and developmental

stage at which a gene is expressed (Jaiswal et al., 2005). The
information in PO was used to derive gene lists. We also collected
sets of genes that are found to be co-expressed in meta-analyses
of expression datasets (Atias et al., 2009; Wilson et al., 2012).
From these seven sources we collected 1909 gene lists (Table 1).

The most challenging part was the extraction of gene lists from
hundreds of published gene expression studies. We examined
1039 datasets in the GEO and 590 in ArrayExpress and were
able to retrieve 783 corresponding papers (52% of the datasets
lacked publication information). After reading the 783 papers,
we found that 397 of them contained 1683 useful sets of differ-
entially expressed genes. Each gene set was annotated with a
unique name and a brief description, accompanied by detailed
information on the source publication. Such information will be
useful in ﬁnding similarities in expression signatures of a user’s
data with those published.

An additional 740 gene sets with less than ﬁve genes were also
collected from the sources mentioned above. All together we
collected 4332 gene sets. These include gene sets similar to all
the categories of MSigDB excluding the C1: position gene sets.
Besides pathway analysis, the databases of differentially ex-
pressed gene lists also serve as an information source that can
be queried or analyzed. Similar attempts have been made for the
human genome to create databases of reported gene lists (Cahan
et al., 2005; Newman and Weiner, 2005). As lists of affected
genes are often the ﬁnal results of genome-wide studies, the arch-
ival of these results will facilitate the easy access to this accumu-
lated knowledge. Our data can be downloaded or queried at
http: //bioinformatics.sdstate.edu/arapath/ .

To demonstrate the utility of the database, we used GSEA to
perform pathway analysis of a dataset (GEO accession number
GSE5534) that measures the response of Arabidopsis seedlings
to cold acclimation (4°C for a day). See Supplementary Materials
1—3 for details. We identiﬁed 12 signiﬁcant GO terms, including
‘Response to cold’, ‘structural constituent of ribosome’, ‘ribo-
some’ and ‘translation’. Proper function of the translation

machinery is necessary at low temperatures, and a previous
genome-wide expression study found the up-regulation of ribo-
somal proteins during cold acclimation (Hannah et al., 2005).
When we ran GSEA with the literature gene sets, we identiﬁed
128 signiﬁcant gene sets, many more than the 12 identiﬁed using
GO gene sets. Out of the top 10 up-regulated gene sets, 5 of them
are cold related. This suggests the genomic response to cold in
the new study is similar to these reported in previous studies.
In summary, we have compiled a gene set database for path-
way analysis in Arabidopsis by extracting information from vari-
ous databases of gene functional categories and pathways. It also
includes over a thousand lists of differentially expressed genes
collected from the published genome-wide studies. We will con-
tinue to add to this database and hope this resource will facilitate
various genomics studies and generate novel hypotheses.

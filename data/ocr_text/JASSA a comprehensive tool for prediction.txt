Abstract

Motivation: Post—translational modification by the Small Ubiquitin—like Modifier (SUMO) proteins,
a process termed SUMOylation, is involved in many fundamental cellular processes. SUMO pro—
teins are conjugated to a protein substrate, creating an interface for the recruitment of cofactors
harboring SUMO—interacting motifs (SlMs). Mapping both SUMO—conjugation sites and SlMs is
required to study the functional consequence of SUMOylation. To define the best candidate sites
for experimental validation we designed JASSA, a Joint Analyzer of SUMOylation site and SlMs.
Results: JASSA is a predictor that uses a scoring system based on a Position Frequency Matrix
derived from the alignment of experimental SUMOylation sites or SlMs. Compared with existing
web—tools, JASSA displays on par or better performances. Novel features were implemented to—
wards a better evaluation of the prediction, including identification of database hits matching the
query sequence and representation of candidate sites within the secondary structural elements
and/or the 3D fold of the protein of interest, retrievable from deposited PDB files.

1 Introduction

 

SUMOylation is a eukaryotic post—translational modification which
consists in the reversible attachment of members of the Small
Ubiquitin-like Modifier (SUMO) protein family on a protein sub—
strate resulting in the dynamic regulation of its biochemical proper-
ties. Proteins involved in many fundamental cellular processes like
DNA repair, transcription control, chromatin organization, macro-
molecular assembly and signal transduction are SUMOylated [for a
review see (Flotho and Melchior, 2013)]. Thus, it is not surprising

that deregulation of SUMOylation is associated to various patho—
logical conditions like neurological disorders, cancers and pathogen
proliferation [for reviews (Droescher et 61]., 2013; Sarge and Park—
Sarge, 2009; Wilson, 2012; Wimmer et 61]., 2012)].

SUMO proteins are conjugated to a lysine (K) residue of the sub—
strate through the sequential action of SUMO—specific activating
(E1), conjugating (E2) and ligating (E3) enzymes and de—conjugation
relies on SUMO—specific proteases. Virtually all eukaryotes eXpress
SUMO proteins, mammals and plants harboring several paralogues,

and the components of the conjugation pathway are highly con-
served across eukaryote proteomes (Flotho and Melchior, 2013;
Gareau and Lima, 2011).

Analysis of SUMO targets shows that the modified K is often
embedded within the consensus sequence ‘I’KxE (where ‘I’ is a
hydrophobic residue and X any amino acid), which is a binding site
for ch9, the single E2 conjugating enzyme (Sampson et al., 2001).
Extended variants of this motif were described, including negatively
charged amino acid—dependent SUMOylation motifs (NDSM)
(Yang et al., 2006), phosphorylation—dependent SUMOylation
motifs (PDSM) (Hietakangas et al., 2006) and phosphorylation
SUMOylation motif (Picard et al., 2012), where a cluster of nega—
tively charged and/or phosphorylatable residues downstream of the
core motif promotes SUMO conjugation by strengthening the inter-
action between the substrate and ch9 (Mohideen et al., 2009).
SUMOylation of the inverted consensus motif ([E/D]xK‘I’) was also
reported (Ivanov et al., 2007; Matic et al., 2010). However, not
every sequence conforming to the consensus motifs is modified,
likely because the environment of the target K must adopt a favor—
able conformation to be accessible to the SUMO machinery (Pichler
et al., 2005). Notably, modification by SUMO occurs at non—
consensus sites. This is the case for N5 0% of the SUMOylated sub—
strates identified by the Vertegaal’s group (Hendriks et al., 2014).

SUMO creates an interface for the recruitment of protein
cofactors that harbor short peptide sequences known as SUMO—
interacting motifs (SIMs). Most SIMs feature a loose consensus se—
quence composed of 3—4 aliphatic residues often flanked by acidic
and/or phosphorylatable amino acids (Kerscher, 2007). The hydro—
phobic core adopts a B—strand conformation that can accommodate
in a pocket formed by the 0(1—helix and the BZ—strand of SUMO
(Hecker et al., 2006; Song et al., 2005). Adjacent negatively
charged residues control the affinity, the polarity and the paralogue—
specificity of the SIIVUSUMO interaction (Chang et al., 2011;
Hecker et al., 2006; Meulmeester et al., 2008).

Mapping SUMO—conjugation sites and SIMs is mandatory to fully
characterize the biological consequences of SUMOylation. Large—scale
mass spectrometry (MS)—based proteomic studies allowed the identifi—
cation of hundreds of proteins harboring SUMOylation sites and/or
SIMs (Blomster et al., 2009; Hendriks et al., 2014; Impens et al.,
2014; Matic et al., 2010; Tammsalu et al., 2014; Tatham et al.,
2011). However, the use of this approach is limited by the transient
nature of the modification, the small fraction of a protein that is
SUMOylated and the difficulty to identify branched peptides resulting
for the tryptic digestion of SUMOylated proteins. When MS data are
not available, computer—aided prediction of SUMOylation sites and
SIMs by in silico analysis represents a promising strategy to reduce the
number of potential targets for experimental verification.

We developed JASSA (Joint analyzer of SUMOylation site
and SIMs) to provide a comprehensive overview of potential
SUMOylation sites and SIMs. The prediction relies on a scoring sys—
tem based on a Position Frequency Matrix (PFM) derived from the
alignment of experimentally validated sequences. When compared
with existing bioinformatics tools, JASSA displays on par or better
predictive performances. To increase the reliability of the prediction,
JASSA offers additional features such as identification of database
(DB) hits matching the query sequence, systematic pattern search
against extended motifs, analysis of the physico—chemical properties
of adjacent residues and, when a PDB file is available, the possibility
to represent candidate sites within the secondary structural elements
and the 3D fold of the query protein. We believe that JASSA will
provide a valuable support for selecting the best candidate sites for
experimental studies.

2 System and methods

2.1 Databases of SUMOylation sites and SlMs

The training DB of SUMOylation sites was generated by collecting
data from PhosphoSite (Hornbeck et al., 2004), Teng et al. (Teng
et al., 2012) and NCBI (publication until January 2011) using
‘SUMO’ and ‘SUMOylation’ as keywords. It encompasses 877
unique SUMOylated experimentally defined K residues from 505
proteins. The sequence of the 21—mer centered on the modified K
was retrieved from UniProt (preiler et al., 2004). JASSA operates
using either of three clusters of experimental SUMOylation sites:
ALL, DIRECT or INVERTED, which include all the sequences of
the DB or the sequences following the direct ‘I’Kx0t or the inverted
ocxK‘I’ consensus, respectively (where ‘I’ is an hydrophobic residue; 0t
is E or D and x is any amino acid) (see below).

The collection of SIMs consists of 102 non—redundant motifs
from 66 proteins obtained from NCBI using ‘(SIM or SBD or SBM)
and SUMO’ as keywords (publication until January 2014). Putative
SIMs from proteins interacting with SUMO in yeast two—hybrid
screens, but not validated further, were not included.

2.2 Characterization of the SUMOylation sites DB and
motifs clustering strategy

Most of the SUMOylation sites retrieved from the scientific litera-
ture and included in our training DB are from Homo sapiens
(71.9%) and rodents (14.7%). The remaining motifs are from yeast,
viruses and plants (5.6, 3.1 and 2.5%, respectively) (Supplementary
Fig. S1A). A pattern search against known SUMOylation consensus
motifs showed that 598 sites (68.2%) of the DB fit with the direct
‘I’Kx0t motif (where ‘I’:A, F, G, I, L, M, P, V or Y; 0t:D or E;
x : any amino acid). Among these 26.3% are NSDM, 3.6% PSDM,
12% HSCM and 20% synergy control motif (Table 1). We also
found that 80 sites of the DB (9.1%) follow the inverted ocxK‘I’ con-
sensus, while 30 (3.4%) fit both the direct and the inverted consen—
sus motif. The remaining 229 sites (26.1%) do not conform to any
of these motifs and are considered as non—consensus. Based on these
observations we grouped the experimental SUMOylation sites in
three clusters which encompass all the sequences of the DB (ALL),
the sites following the direct ‘I’Kxoc (DIRECT) or the inverted ocxK‘I’
consensus (INVERTED). We reasoned that the DB of JASSA being
enriched in sequences that match the direct ‘I’Kxoc motif (>68%),
while inverted motifs are underrepresented (<10%), could under-
mine the prediction of sites that fit the ocxK‘I’ pattern.

Next, we analyzed the local target protein context in a 21-mer
window centered on the SUMOylated K (position 0) for each cluster
with WebLogo3 (Crooks et al., 2004) (Fig. 1). The sequence logo
for the cluster ALL agrees with the prevalence of the ‘I’Kxoc motif in
the DB. At position —1 there is a higher occurrence of hydrophobic
amino acids most of which are residues with aliphatic side chains
(67.5% among which 27.7% are I, 12.7% are L and 23.7% are V),
whereas aromatic amino acids are rare (5.4% of which 4.6% are F)
(Supplementary Table S1A). At position +2 acidic residues are sig—
nificantly enriched (70% E, 5.4% D). Finally, no particular amino
acid is overrepresented at position +1. As expected, the sequence
logo of the cluster DIRECT is similar except that position —1 is
occupied exclusively by hydrophobic residues, whereas E (~94%)
and D (~6%) are the only amino acids found at position +2.
Consistent with the fact that about a third of the SUMOylation sites
of the collection match with the NDSM or the PDSM motifs, acidic
and/or phosphorylatable residues are enriched downstream of the
core consensus motif (Fig. 1 and Table 1). The amino acids distribu—
tion around the SUMO—acceptor K is different for the cluster

Fig. 1. Characterization of the collection of SUMOylation sites. The sequence logo representations of the 21-mer harboring the SUMO-acceptor K residue
for motifs included in the cluster ALL, DIRECT or INVERTED were obtained with WebLogo3 (Crooks et al., 2004) using bits unit (left) or probability unit (right).
The 5-mer (positions —2 to +2) used to define the frequency plots (Supplementary Table S1) is indicated

INVERTED (Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1A). A similar inci-
dence of E (55%) and D (45%) is found at position —2. Non—polar
residues are still enriched at position +1 (97.5 %). However, there
is a greater variety of residues, with a higher rate of P (22.5%), A
(15%), F (12.5%) and M (~9%), and a lower occurrence of I
(~6.3%), L (~6.3%) and V (25%) compared with the sequences of
the cluster ALL or DIRECT. Finally, the sequence logo for the
non—consensus sites has an ambiguous profile, the SUMOylated K
being the only conserved residue (Fig. 1). In agreement with the fact
that the SUMOylation pathway is highly conserved among eukary-
otes, similar sequence logos were obtained for the SUMOylation
sites belonging to yeast proteins (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.3 Characterization of the SlMs DB and motifs
clustering strategy

The identification of SIMs, which act as SUMO recognition mod—
ules, is necessary to better understand the functional consequences

of SUMOylation. To develop a protocol for computer—aided predic—
tion, we generated a DB by collecting 102 experimentally validated
SIMs, most of which are from human proteins (62.4%). The remain-
ing sequences are from rodent (3.0%), yeast (12.9%) and viruses
(16.8%) (Supplementary Fig. S1B).

Alignment of the hydrophobic core (positions —2 to +2) of these
sequences showed that V and I represent more than 5 0% of the amino
acids occurring at position —2 and —1, respectively, while having
a rate ranging from 19 to 28% at other positions (Supplementary
Table S1B). L is the most frequent residue at position +2 (45 %).
Although its occurrence is around 6% at other positions, L is never—
theless the more represented residue after V and I, the other amino
acids having rates below 3%.

We manually curated the alignment of the 24—mer centered on the
hydrophobic core for the 102 motifs of the DB and defined 5 types of
SIMs (Fig. 2 and Table 2). The SIM consensus being degenerate, some
experimental sites could fit with more than one pattern. Motifs

Fig.2. Characterization of the collection of SlMs. Alignment of the 24 amino acid-long sequences harboring experimentally proved SlMs. The consensus motifs

used to classify the sequences are shown below each cluster. Residues V, l, L (‘1’) are colored in yellow, D and E (or) in green, S in blue, T in purple and F and Y in

orange

matching the consensus ‘I’Tx‘I’ (type 1), ‘I’xT‘I’ (type 2), ‘I’T‘I’T (type
3), x‘I’T‘I’ (type 4) and ‘I’OL‘I’OL‘I’ (type 5) (where ‘I’ :V, I or L; 0t : D
or E and x: any amino acids), represent ~60, 40, 20, 30 and 4% of
the collection, respectively. A deeper analysis of the sequences of type 1
cluster showed that ~40% of the sites match with the V[I/V]DLT pat—
tern. In this context, Sun and Hunter (2012) showed that aromatic resi—
dues can be accommodated at position —2 as in the SIMs of FLASH/
CASP8AP2 and C5orf25. Thus, we named the group of sites which
comprise an F or Y residue at position —2 ‘type 1 bis’ cluster (Fig. 2).
Only 5 out of 102 known SIMs could not be included in any cluster.

2.4 Determination of the prediction performances

To compute the area under the curve (AUC) of the Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC) curves for the prediction of
SUMOylation sites by JASSA using any of the three clusters (ALL,
DIRECT, INVERTED) or GPS—SUMO, we used the R package
pROC, notably the ‘roc()’ function with no smoothing method
(R Core Team, 2015; Robin et al., 2011).

The evaluation was performed using (i) the testing dataset of
SUMOhydro which consists of 24 positive and 510 negative motifs
(Chen et al., 2012); (ii) the 4351 positive site identified by the
Vertegaal’s group in 1489 proteins (Hendriks et al., 2014). As a
matching negative dataset, we selected the 68325 K residues from
the same proteins which SUMOylation was not detected. The results
were plotted using the R package ggplot2 (Wickham, 2009).

3 Algorithm

3.1 Scoring strategy and definition of cut—off values for
the prediction of SUMOylation sites

Sequence analysis of SUMOylation sites points to a hydrophobic and
an acidic amino acids surrounding the target K (position 0) as major
determinants of SUMO conjugation (Fig. 1). Thus, we established a
scoring system where the occurrence of these residues, which are

found at position —1 and +2 in direct consensus motifs or —2 and +1
in inverted consensus motifs, is used to quantify the eventuality of a K
residue to lie within a SUMOylation site. The method is based on a
PFM at four positions generated by aligning the sequences of the
selected cluster (ALL, DIRECT or INVERTED) (Supplementary
Table S1A). Each K residue of a query is given two predictive scores
(PS) termed PSd and PSi. When either the cluster ALL or DIRECT
is selected, the scores are defined as PSd : f_1(aa_1) >< f0(K0) >< [(+2
(61611.2) X 100 and P51 2 f_1(aa+1) >< f0(K0)>< f+2(aa_2) X 100.
When the cluster INVERTED is chosen, the scores are defined as
PSd = f+1(aa_1) >< f0(K0) >< f_2(aa+2) X 100 and P51 2 [(+1 (61611.1)
><f0(K0) >< f_2(aa_2) x 100. In these formulas, fp(aaq) is the fre—
quency at position p of the amino acid (amino acids) at position q
for the selected cluster. Note that f0(K0) : 1 and the frequency of
residues that are absent is set to 0.0001. Since the majority of
SUMOylation sites of the DB conform to the canonical consensus
pattern, hydrophobic residues are overrepresented at position —1
(Fig. 1 and Supplementary Table S1A). To avoid any bias when
analyzing putative inverted SUMOylation sites, the frequencies of
the amino acids at position +1 and —1 are not considered in the
calculation of the PSd and the PSi, respectively.

Two cut—off values were defined by decision tree analysis for
each cluster of SUMOylation sites (Fig. 3A—C). To this aim, a posi—
tive and a negative datasets composed of 358 bona fide
SUMOylated motifs and 8071 non—SUMOylated sites, respectively
(Chen et al., 2012), were analyzed with JASSA choosing either the
cluster ALL, DIRECT or INVERTED. The best score (either PSd or
PSi) for each sequence tested was submitted to SIPINA Research
(http://eric.univ—lyon2.fr/~ricco/sipina.html).

3.2 Scoring strategy and definition of cut—off values for
the prediction of SlMs

For the detection of putative SIMs, the query protein is scanned
against multiple consensus motifs (Table 2), and a PS is calculated

method C4.5, following analysis with JASSA of the SUMOylated and non-SUMOylated sequences from the control datasets of Chen et al. (2012) with cluster ALL
(A), DIRECT (B), INVERTED (C). The distribution (in %, y-axis) of the positive (green) and the negative (red) motifs of the control clusters after separation by the
two cut-off values is shown. The cut-off values for the prediction of SIM motifs (D) were defined with the same methodology as for the SUMOylation sites. The
distribution (in %, y—axis) of the positive (green) and the negative (red) motifs of the control datasets after separation by the four cut-off values is shown

for each tetrapeptide that fits at least one of them. The algorithm for
SIMs prediction is based on a PFM at four positions derived from
the alignment of the sequences of the training DB. The score is calcu—

lated as PS : 100 X Hilﬂaai), where  is the frequency of a given

amino acid at position i in the frequency table (Supplementary Table

81B).

We defined four different thresholds for the SIM predictor with

(A) AUC obtained using the SUMOhydro dataset. (B) AUC obtained using the Vertegaal’s group dataset

(Fig. 3D). The positive test dataset consists of the 102 known SIMs.
The negative test dataset is composed of the remaining 868 motifs
that match at least one of the previously defined consensus patterns
(Table 2) within the same proteins, and not included in the positive
dataset.

3.3 Prediction of a negatively charged—residue stretch
flanking a putative SIM

We manually curated the 10—amino acids long sequences upstream
and downstream the 102 SIMs of the DB and arbitrarily decided on
the presence or the absence of a [DES] stretch. Each sequence was

. i+2
g1ven a score calculated as follows: PSstretcj1 : 12,- X E H412), where

12,-: 1 when E, D or S is found at position i; or 12,-: 0 if any other
residue is found position 1'. Next, the positive and negative clusters
were analyzed with SIPINA Research and a cut—off was set at
PSstretch: 5 (Supplementary Fig. S3). The letter ‘N’ (PSstretd1 g 5) or
‘Y’ (PSstretd1 > 5) in the result output indicates the absence or the
presence of a [DES] cluster, respectively.

3.4 Predictive performance assessment and
comparison with other predictors

The prediction performances of JASSA were evaluated using the
independent test datasets of Chen et al. (2012). Accuracy (Ac), sensi—
tivity (Sn), specificity (Sp) and strength (St) were calculated as

follows:
A_ TP+TN .S_ TP .8_ TN .
C_TP+TN+FP+FN’ n_TP+FN’ p_TN+FP’
St_Sn+Sp_

2

TP (true positives) and TN (true negative) are the number of
SUMOylated and non—SUMOylated K residues that were correctly
predicted or rejected, respectively; FP (false positive) and FN
(false negative) are the number of over—predicted or under—predicted

The results of these assessments for JASSA are shown in
Supplementary Table S2. The performances of JASSA were also
benchmarked against GPS—SUMO (Zhao et al., 2014). Indeed, the
authors of GPS—SUMO proved the superiority of their algorithm
over other available methods and their web—based service allows for
batched prediction.

We used the test dataset from SUMOhydro (Chen et al., 2012)
and the dataset created from the extensive results of Vertegaal’s lab
(Hendriks et al., 2014). We plotted the ROC curves and calculated
the AUC for JASSA (with any of the three clusters ALL, DIRECT
and INVERTED) and for GPS—SUMO.

In all the cases, JASSA displayed superior performances (Fig. 4).
The performances of the SIM prediction tool of JASSA were eval—
uated by a bootstrap approach and compared with the SIM pre-
dictor of GPS—SUMO (Zhao et al., 2014). The whole DB was
randomly distributed in five equal—sized portions. Four portions

were used to create a frequency table. The remaining 20% of the
positive dataset was tested in parallel with 20% of the negative data—
set to establish the number of TP, TN, FP and FN. This analysis was
reiterated a thousand times. Since GPS—SUMO does not analyze
some of the motifs contained in the DB of JASSA (19/102 positive
and 140/826 negative), their score was set to 0, not to introduce a
strong bias in favor of JASSA. Overall, the performances of JASSA
are better or on par with those of GPS—SUMO (Table 3). Notably,
JASSA features a ‘Very High’ threshold, which allows the identifica—
tion of putative SIMs with Sp reaching 99.5% and an Ac of 91%
(Table 3).

Altogether these results indicate that JASSA is a robust and
accurate tool for the prediction of both SUMOylation sites and
SIMs.

4 Implementation

4.1 Additional features of JASSA complement the
scoring system and improve prediction evaluation
Identification of potential SUMOylation sites and SIMs faces major
challenges represented by sequences matching the consensus but
that are not functional (false positive) or functional sequences
diverging from the consensus (false negative). We implemented sev—
eral options that complement the scoring system towards a better
evaluation of the predication.

° Pattern search against extended motifs. Although the sequence of
the core consensus motifs is a key determinant, other factors like
the local protein composition inﬂuence the propensity of a sub—
strate to interact with SUMO in either a covalent or a non—
covalent manner. For instance, more than a half of the
experimental sites ﬁtting the ‘I’Kx0t pattern are included within
extended motifs characterized by a high occurrence of phosphor—
ylatable and/or negatively charged residues (Table 1). JASSA
systematically scans the sequence ﬂanking each candidate site
against known extended SUMOylation motifs or SIM variants
(Tables 1 and 2). A positive match, which is indicated in the
output with the corresponding sequence highlighted
(Supplementary Fig. S4), might support the prediction of a func—
tionally relevant site.

° Analysis of the physico-chemical properties of adjacent amino
acids. Since extended variants of inverted SUMOylation motifs
have not been characterized yet, we designed an option to high—
light negatively charged, phosphorylatable or hydrophobic
amino acids within the 21—mer surrounding each candidate site.
By analyzing the sequence surrounding experimental SIMs we
noted a high prevalence of negatively—charged and/or phosphory—
latable residues. In particular, more than 50% of the known
SIMs position +3 is occupied by E, S, D and T (Fig. 2). We there—
fore developed an algorithm to predict whether negatively
charged amino acids and/or serine residues are enriched near the
candidate site. Given that the consensus for SIM is degenerate,
this information will be helpful to select or reject a candidate
site.

° Graphical representation of the prediction with secondary
protein elements and within the 3D fold of the protein. An im-
portant parameter which impacts on both SUMO conjugation
and the SUMO—SIM interaction is the topology of the candidate
site. Most validated SUMOylation events occur in extended
loops or intrinsically disordered regions of the substrate outside
its globular fold, and all known SIMs display a B—strand con—
formation (Sekiyama et al., 2008; Song et al., 2005). To have an

insight on the local protein conformation at a candidate site, an
option is provided to represent secondary structural elements
extracted from a PDB ﬁle below the protein sequence where can—
didate sites are annotated allowing an easy comparison
(Supplementary Fig. S4B and C). This feature might ease for in-
stance the identiﬁcation of tandem arrays of SIMs, a feature of
SUMO—dependent Ubiquitin ligases (STUbL) (Sun and Hunter,
2012)

° When a PDB reference is provided, a PyMol script ﬁle is also gen—
erated, where candidate sites are annotated within the 3D fold of
the protein of interest (Supplementary Fig. S4C). Altogether,
these informations will help reject false positive, i.e. sites having
a high PS because their sequence matches the consensus motif
but which do not adapt a favorable conformation or are buried
within the globular fold of the protein.

° ‘DB hit’ ﬁnder: This feature indicates whether a candidate site
matches a previously validated SUMOylation site or SIM. Each
5—mer centered on a K and each putative SIM of the query is sys—
tematically scanned against the proper DB to retrieve matching
hits. The number of experimentally validated SUMOylation site
or SIM corresponding to the candidate site is returned in the out—
put. For each hit JASSA provides the link to the protein deposited
on NCBI and UniProt and the PubMed reference of the publica—
tion. This option allows the detection of sites that diverge from
the consensus and would otherwise be rejected because of their
low PS. Moreover, this feature has been updated with a list of
motifs known until 2014 (Hendriks et al., 2014; Tammsalu
et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2014).

4.2 Use of JASSA and output description

JASSA is a freely accessible web—based tool which offers a user—
friendly interface. The default parameters are designed to give the best
results in most cases, but they can be adjusted for particular needs.
The user can submit a sequence (protein or nucleotide sequence) in ei—
ther Text or FASTA format, upload a FASTA file or input a UniProt
protein ID. The results are returned in the form of a table—list report—
ing the position of the candidate K residue, the sequence of the 21—
mer centered on it, the PS, the consensus type and the number of DB
hits. Under default settings (‘Analyze with: Best Predictions’), every 5 —
mer centered on a K is scored using independently the cluster ALL,
DIRECT and INVERTED. The default parameter for the result out—
put (only ‘interesting’ results) displays the sites that either have a PS at
least above the low threshold or fit with a consensus motif or match a
motif in the DB. A second table resumes the results for putative SIMs:
position, PS, consensus type, presence of a potential acidic/serine
stretch and the DB hit count. A graphical representation of the protein
sequence of the query, where candidate sites are annotated is also pro—
vided. The results of a query are exportable under the GeneProt for—
mat. When a .pdb file is given, corresponding secondary structural
elements can be visualized in the output and an annotated 3D struc—
ture can be downloaded under the form of a PyMol script.

5 Discussion

We designed JASSA to provide a comprehensive overview of poten—
tial SUMOylation sites and SIMs of a protein of interest, assisting in
the selection of candidate sites for further experimentation.
Prediction of SUMO—modified K is based on a large DB encom—
passing 877 experimentally characterized SUMOylation sites, among
which ~68% match the direct ‘I’Kx0t motif and ~9% the inverted
ocxK‘I’ motif. We also observed that either consensus pattern displays

91% ‘09 1sn3nv uo sopﬁuv s01 ‘121u10111123 aIo AlISJQAIUn 112 /§.IO'S[BU.IHO[p.IOJXO'SOIlBIHJOJUIOIQ/ﬁdllq 11101; pop1201umoq

specific features in terms of amino acid composition. As an example,
the acidic residue (0t) is almost exclusively an E in direct sites, whereas
a similar incidence of E and D is found in inverted motifs. Regarding
the hydrophobic residue (‘I’), this position is occupied by P in more
than 22% of the inverted sites, whereas this amino acid is found in
only 4.2% of the direct sites. Based on these findings, we established
two clusters including sites matching either the direct or the inverted
SUMOylation consensus motif, to favor the prediction of SUMO—con—
jugation sites which are underrepresented in the full DB, such as in-
verted SUMOylation sites. As an example the peptide DVKA obtains
a PSi of 0.174 or 0.114 using the clusters ALL or DIRECT, respect—
ively. Both scores being below the low threshold (Fig. 3), this site
would be rejected. The same query would receive a score above the
threshold (PSi:6.750), if the prediction is performed choosing the
cluster INVERTED, and would therefore be considered further.

JASSA also allows identifying putative SIMs, a feature currently
performed only by GPS—SUMO (Zhao et al., 2014). SIMs are found
in a wide variety of proteins such as downstream effectors of the
SUMO pathway and SUMO enzymes. Some SUMO substrates [i.e.
Daxx (Chang et al., 2011) and USP25 (Meulmeester et al., 2008)]
also harbor SIMs, which were proposed to recruit SUMO—loaded
ch9 leading to the conjugation of SUMO to proximal sites includ—
ing K within non—consensus sequences.

The major shortcoming of SUMOylation sites and SIMs predic—
tion is the difficulty to correctly classify the false positive and the
false negative. To overcome this problem, we developed features
that can help the user to refine the prediction. Indeed, JASSA’s out—
put can give informations about the structure and the physico—
chemical environment of the candidate site and whether or not it
has already been experimentally validated.

We benchmarked JASSA against existing predictors and found
that it reaches better or equivalent levels of performance. Thus, we
believe that JASSA will be a valuable tool to help biologists identify—
ing the best candidate sites for experimentations aiming to better
understand SUMOylation and its contribution to cell biology.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: One of the major challenges for contemporary bioinfor—
matics is the analysis and accurate annotation of genomic datasets to
enable extraction of useful information about the functional role of
DNA sequences. This article describes a novel genome-wide statis-
tical approach to the detection of specific DNA sequence motifs
based on similarities between the promoters of similarly expressed
genes. This new tool, cisExpress, is especially designed for use with
large datasets, such as those generated by publicly accessible whole
genome and transcriptome projects. cisExpress uses a task farming
algorithm to exploit all available computational cores within a shared
memory node. We demonstrate the robust nature and validity of the
proposed method. It is applicable for use with a wide range of gen-
omic databases for any species of interest.

Availability: cisExpress is available at www.cisexpress.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

The amount of raw data available in publicly accessible genomic
databases is growing exponentially in the form of massive linear
arrays of DNA sequences. Robust analysis and accurate anno-
tation of these datasets are needed to extract useful information
about the functional role of the DNA sequences. One of the key
goals of genome analysis is the identiﬁcation of putative genome
function, especially the detection of potential DNA cis—regula—
tory elements, with high conﬁdence. Identifying the regulatory
motifs bound by transcription factors can provide crucial in-
sights into the mechanisms of transcriptional regulation. By cor-
rectly identifying regulatory motifs, it is possible to predict the
expression of the genes under speciﬁc circumstances or in speciﬁc
tissues. Furthermore, molecular mechanisms of genetic diseases,
caused by the incorrect expression of some genes, can be dis-
covered. It has been recently demonstrated that in the case of
the mouse genome, many in vitro-derived motifs performed simi-
larly to motifs derived from in vivo data (Weirauch et al., 2013).
However, major problems in studying the speciﬁcity of the

binding of transcription factors to DNA motifs include a lack
of data and deﬁciencies in predictive models for motif detection.
Several efforts have been made to compare existing methods for
computational identiﬁcation of regulatory patterns (Sandve and
Drablos, 2006; Tompa et al., 2005; Troukhan et al., 2009). These
benchmarking studies suggested that prediction of regulatory
elements remains a challenge for computational biologists, and
that more work is required to optimize the algorithms used.
Although different programs may perform better for individual
datasets, no single method takes all relevant elements into con-
sideration. Users are advised to use a combination of several
motif-ﬁnding tools for best results. For this reason, we decided
to develop a novel tool, called cisExpress, which is designed to
achieve more effective analysis of large datasets in a manner that
is both cost effective and highly robust in its predictive capacity.

2 METHODS

The core element of cisExpress is a signiﬁcantly improved and enhanced
adaptation of an earlier method, Motifer (Troukhan et al., 2009) (not
publicly available), speciﬁcally modiﬁed to process large datasets.
cisExpress is based on two important assumptions: (i) the function of pro-
moter motifs is position speciﬁc, and (ii) microarray data provide reason-
able measurements of transcript abundance and reﬂect promoter activity.

2.1 Data preparation

The majority of gene expression data used to validate our algorithm was
taken from AtGenExpress developmental experiment (Schmid et al.,
2005). In addition, we used abiotic stress experiment data (Kilian et al.,
2007; von Koskull—Doring et al., 2007) and nitrate response experiments
(Wang et al. 2003). Gene expression intensities were log transformed. For
the variability dataset, we used standard deviation of gene expression
values in the log scale across all analyzed conditions, and for the strength
dataset, we used geometric average of gene expression variables, log
transformed. Promoter sequences were obtained using the TSSer algo-
rithm (Troukhan et al., 2009), using 188 506 5’ expressed sequence tag
(EST) sequences and 25 026 full-length mRNA sequences of Arabidopsis
thaliana, available at GenBank. Genomic sequences (version 9) were
downloaded from The Arabidopsis Information Resource Web site. We
aligned EST and mRNA sequences against the genomic sequence using
Washington University Blast, storing only the best match per EST. Each
EST and mRNA match was assigned to one locus, and frequencies of hits
per genomic position were computed for each locus. The genomic pos-
ition of the most representative transcription start site (TSS) per locus
corresponds to the mode of EST/mRNA hits distribution. For each
locus, we have extracted 1000 nt in positions [TSS-500, TSS+500].

Method

cisExpress divides the motif-fmding problem into two general stages:

Stage I: Detecting ‘seed’ motifs. This stage determines consensus se-
quences of motifs and their approximate position in the promoter region.
It follows the steps of Motifer (Troukhan et al., 2009). The discovery of
motifs is performed in overlapping windows of predeﬁned size. For every
word present in the observed window, we calculate Z—score according to
Equation 1.9 in the Supplementary Material.

ewith(wa k) — ewithout(wa k)

\/Stdev3vith(w, k) StdevaithoutM, k)
nwith(ws k) nwithout(Ws k)

Zscore (W:  =

 

 

 

where ewi,h(w,k) and ewithou/wk) are average gene expression values;
Stdevwi,h(w,k) and Stdevwithou/wk) are standard deviation of gene ex-
pression values; nw,,h(w,k) and nwithou/wk) are the number of sequences
of genes containing and not containing word w in the kth window.

Words with Z—scores above a predeﬁned threshold are stored as
primary motifs. Groups of similar motifs discovered within one
window are then merged together resulting in longer and/or more am-
biguous motifs. This part of the method outputs the motif in the form of
a consensus sequence and includes the position of window where it was
discovered.

Stage 2: ‘Optimizing the previously obtained motifs’. In this stage, a
genetic algorithm (GA) (Holland, 1992; Wall, 2007) is applied to each of
the motifs detected in Stage 1 to determine the best possible motif model
and motif position (optimization process tries to maximize absolute value
of Z—score of the motif). The output consists of an Nx4 motif matrix
(where N is the length of the motif), representing relative frequencies of
nucleotides in the motif. For each position within the motif, there is a
probability that each base occurs at that position. This representation
also includes information about motif conservation and position.
Speciﬁcations of used GA can be found in the Supplementary
Material. This stage is unique to cisExpress.

Availability: cisExpress is available for use from www.cisexpress.org as
a stand-alone open-source application or via a web interface. The web
interface submits jobs to a high-performance computing system (currently
HPC Wales, www.hpcwales.co.uk), where the efﬁcient parallel implemen-
tation of cisExpress ensures easy and fast access to the tool without the
requirement to install the software. In the near future, we aim to incorp-
orate our novel improved method for promoter prediction into this inter-
face. These tools will then form a pipeline.

3 RESULTS

The cisExpress algorithm was applied to 13 379 promoter regions
of the classical genetic plant model, A.thaliana, using 11 gene
expression datasets. Promoter sequences were randomly divided
into training and testing sets (in a 50:50 ratio). Sequences in
the training set were used to ﬁnd the highest-scoring motifs
for each experimental condition using the cisExpress and
MatrixREDUCE (F oat et al., 2006) programs. The testing set
promoters were examined for the presence of the motifs, and
corresponding gene expression values were compared for genes
whose promoters did and did not contain the motifs, using a
t-test. A full description of the benchmark is given in the
Supplementary Material. Most of the motifs identiﬁed by the
two programs are those previously identiﬁed and well character-
ized in promoters of A.thaliana. For example, CACGTG is
an abscisic acid responsive element-like binding site motif
involved in both dehydration-related and low-temperature-
responsive gene expression. The 5’-TATAAA-3’ DNA sequence
(TATA)-box is typically associated with the variability of gene

expression, including tissue and stress speciﬁcity (Troukhan
et al., 2009). CATGC, detected in the SEEDS and FLOWERS
sets, is a canonical RY (RY element, having a typical sequence
CATGCATG, is conserved in the promoter regions of the genes
of legume seed storage proteins) seed-speciﬁc motif. Motifs
GGCCC in core promoter regions of activated genes were pre-
viously observed (Molina and Grotewold, 2005). Motif CTAGA,
associated with the Huntingtin, Elongation factor 3, protein
phosphatsase 2A, TORl repeats (HEAT) dataset, is a putative
response element for multiprotein bridging factor 1 (MBFl),
which controls the expression of 36 different transcripts during
heat stress (Suzuki et al., 2011). Motif AGGCC (identiﬁed as
important for gene expression under NITROGEN stress) is
bound by a group of transcription factors known as the TCP
[teosinte branched l (TBl), cycloidea (CYC), proliferating cell
factors 1 and 2 03CF1 and PCF 2)] family (Walley et al., 2011). A
comparison between MatrixREDUCE and cisExpress for 11
gene expression datasets is given in Table 1. For each experimen-
tal condition, Table 1 shows consensus sequence of the best 5-nt
motif, position of the motif (for cisExpress) and P—value of the t-
test. This shows that cisExpress is capable of detecting position
weight matrices that are more speciﬁc and that result in lower t-
test P—values across all analyzed conditions. cisExpress is able to
outperform MatrixREDUCE owing to its use of motif position
information and the addition of the GA optimization step to
tune position weight matrices. The high performance computing
back-end and efﬁcient parallel implementation of the code also
allows cisExpress to handle large datasets, such as those gener-
ated by publicly accessible whole genome and transcriptome pro-
jects. For the A.thaliana benchmark used in Table 1 (consisting
of 98 discrete tasks to distribute among the available computa-
tional cores), the parallel strategy reduces execution time for the
motif detecting part of the algorithm by a factor of 18.5 within a
(64-core) node. For a larger dataset (with far more tasks than
available cores), better parallel scaling would be expected.
Complete parallel performance results for cisExpress are pre-
sented in Supplementary Material. In conclusion, we demon-
strated the robust nature and validity of the cisExpress
algorithm. cisExpress is an organism-independent tool and it is
applicable for use with a wide range of genomic databases.

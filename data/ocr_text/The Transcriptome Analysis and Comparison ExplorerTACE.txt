ABSTRACT

Motivation: Next generation sequencing (NGS) technologies allow
a rapid and cost-effective compilation of large RNA sequence
datasets in model and non-model organisms. However, the storage
and analysis of transcriptome information from different NGS
platforms is still a significant bottleneck, leading to a delay in data
dissemination and subsequent biological understanding. Especially
database interfaces with transcriptome analysis modules going
beyond mere read counts are missing. Here, we present the
Transcriptome Analysis and Comparison Explorer (T-ACE), a tool
designed for the organization and analysis of large sequence
datasets, and especially suited for transcriptome projects of non-
model organisms with little or no a priori sequence information.
T-ACE offers a TCL—based interface, which accesses a PostgreSQL
database via a php-script. Within T-ACE, information belonging to
single sequences or contigs, such as annotation or read coverage,
is linked to the respective sequence and immediately accessible.
Sequences and assigned information can be searched via keyword-
or BLAST-search. Additionally, T-ACE provides within and between
transcriptome analysis modules on the level of expression, GO
terms, KEGG pathways and protein domains. Results are visualized
and can be easily exported for external analysis. We developed
T-ACE for laboratory environments, which have only a limited amount
of bioinformatics support, and for collaborative projects in which
different partners work on the same dataset from different locations
or platforms (Windows/Linux/MacOS). For laboratories with some
experience in bioinformatics and programming, the low complexity of
the database structure and open-source code provides a framework
that can be customized according to the different needs of the user
and transcriptome project.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in sequencing technology have led to an increasing
accumulation of transcriptomic (RNAseq) data. Although most
of the data has been generated in model organisms for which
a high number of annotated sequences and complete genomes
are available, increasing transcriptomic sequence data for non—
model organisms are generated, for which only little or no
a priori sequence information exists. The analysis of the obtained
sequences and/or contigs, therefore, relies on comparative analysis
with annotated genes or protein domains of other organisms. A
multimodal comparison with a high number of sequences from
different organisms and databases, e.g. NCBI, UniProtKB, Gene
Ontology (GO), KEGG (Ashburner et al., 2000; Kanehisa and
Goto, 2000), should be pursued to gain a wider picture of the
putative biological role of a speciﬁc sequence. This approach,
however, increases the quantity of information per sequence and
adds to the already large amount of data. Not only bioinformatic
processing of sequences (i.e. cleaning, assembly and annotation)
is still a bottleneck in RNASeq, but so is the subsequent analysis
of annotated sequences. The analyzing scientist is faced with
the problem of organizing the manifold BLAST hits, protein
domains, GO terms and KEGG pathway information assigned to ten
thousands of individual sequences, together with the mere sequence
information such as nucleotide and translated protein sequence,
protein domain organization or, in case of assembled contigs, read
coverage.

To date a number of software solutions exist for the assembly
and annotation of transcriptomes. Major efforts have been put
into the development of reference—guided and de novo assembly
tools. Several assemblers such as MIRA (Chevreux et al., 2004),
Newbler (Roche/454 Life Sciences), CAP3 (Huang and Madan,
1999), Velvet (Zerbino and Birney, 2008) and others were developed
by researchers together with software and sequencing companies, of
which some are especially designed for different NGS applications
e. g. 454, Illumina or SOLID. It must be noted, that de novo RNA
sequence assembly is a particularly difﬁcult bioinformatic problem,
as e.g. the existence of transcript isoforms usually results in many
different contigs that cannot be merged in a simple fashion (for
review see Kumar and Blaxter, 2010; Martin and Wang, 2011).
Beyond the mere sequence assembly, a suite of software solutions
for clustering (Partigen), protein prediction (prot4EST) and GO,

KEGG and EC annotation (annot8r, Blast2Go, AutoFACT) of non—
model organism EST data has been developed by different working
groups (Conesa et al., 2005; Koski et al., 2005; Parkinson et al.,
2004; Schmid and Blaxter, 2008; Wasmuth and Blaxter, 2004). To
work with the results tables of the various software tools, non—
bioinformatically skilled biologists, however, rely on user—friendly
front ends which preferably work on various operating systems
(Windows/Linux/MacOS). Within the Generic Model Organism
Database project (GMOD, gmod.org), the web front end TRIPAL
and also Gbrowse was developed for the Chado database structure.
Also annot8r recommends visualization by Gbrowse, whereas
Blast2Go has an integrated user interface to view and manage the
annotated sequence data. These currently available interfaces are,
however, predominantly focused on the visualization of genomes
and their associated annotation—, expression— or publication data.
Concerning transcriptome studies, however, databases and interfaces
especially designed for transcriptome studies with analysis modules
going beyond a mere display of read count numbers are still missing.
Ideally, a software tool for transcriptome analysis will link all
available information for a single transcript, and also enable a
transcriptome wide overview and analysis on transcript and read
count (expression) level. Information and results ﬁles should be
exportable in a common format and the tool should allow an
implementation of additional analysis modules for customization
to speciﬁc needs. In order to serve these needs, we developed the
software tool T—ACE with a Windows/Linux/MacOS interface to
organize and analyze large amounts of transcriptome data, especially
of non—model organisms with limited sequence information.

2 METHODS

2.1 Installation

All components of T—ACE are written as TCL scripts using the TCL/T K
8.5 software. Most of the scripts depend on additional TCL packages, such
as: bwidget v1.9.2, tablelist, tclthread v2.6.5 (and libpgtcl v1.7, in case of
the T—ACEpg version or the T—ACE_DB_Manager). For the full function
of T—ACE, the additional software tools such as InterProScan v4.6 (Hunter
et al., 2009), NCBI—BLAST—2.2.25+, PHOBOS v3.3.2 (Mayer, 2007) and
Primer3 v1.1.4 (Rozen and Skaletsky, 2000) are required. T—ACE is based
on a PostgreSQL 8.4 database system. For non—local use, the PostgreSQL—
server can be accessed via a PHP—enabled Apache 2.0 Web server. T—ACE
and its necessary PostgreSQL—server runs on any standard computer, but the
performance depends on the size of the examined dataset. The biggest dataset
tested so far contains ~ 120 000 contigs, 400 000 protein open reading frames
(ORFs), over 3.1 million reads and according annotations. This database
currently runs without difﬁculty on a dual—core unix system with 8GB
RAM. The T—ACE client can be executed on the same machine without
memory issues or high processor load (4 GB RAM should be sufﬁcient).
Two different versions of T—ACE are currently available. The ‘T—ACE’
version accesses the PostgreSQL database through a php script, which has
to run on the database server. With this version Pgtcl is not needed for
running the T—ACE client. The ‘T—ACEpg’ version accesses the PostgreSQL
database directly. For this version, the Pgtcl package is needed. In both
versions, the T—ACE_DB_Manager accesses the database directly, therefore
needs the Pgtcl package. A scheme of the T—ACE database is given in
Supplementary Figure Sl. After the required software is installed, T—ACE.tcl
and T—ACE_DB_Manager.tcl should be executable. Detailed instructions,
such as information about the additional software and its installation or how
to set up the parent database, are described in the T—ACE manual and webpage
(http://www.ikmb.uni—kiel.de/tace/).

Fig. 1. Schematic overview of the generation and annotation of a T—ACE
database. After creating a new database there are the following steps to
perform: (i) adding sequence information: sequence information (protein
or nucleotides) is added by uploading an ACE— or FASTA—ﬁle into the
database. Uploading an ACE—ﬁle will not only add contig entries, but will
also provide information about the positioning of the reads in each contig.
Nucleotide/contig sequences can be directly translated into protein database
entries. (ii) Blasting: nucleotide/contig or protein entries can be blasted at
NCBI with the ‘NCBI—BLAST’—module or BLAST results imported into a
database from a text ﬁle. The BLAST annotation can be used to deduce GO,
InterProScan or KEGG annotations or Blast2GO results in .annot format can
be imported into a database. (iii) InterProScan: contig or protein entries can
be annotated by InterProScan, for this a custom installation of InterProScan
with web interface is needed. Alternatively, InterProScan result ﬁles, in .raw
format, can be imported into a database. InterProScan hits also lead to GO
annotations, which can be used to deduce KEGG annotations.

2.2 Implementation

General comment: T—ACE was developed for the analysis and organization
of transcriptome projects but is also helpful for the organization of small
sequence datasets e. g. extracts of a large transcriptome databases. The current
version of T—ACE does not provide an assembly function, thus data gained
by NGS projects (e.g. 454, Illumina, SoliD) have to be assembled prior to
the upload (e. g. using Newbler, Celera or TGICL). T—ACE currently accepts
ACE or SAM ﬁles from different assembly and alignment programs. It must
be emphasized that the choice of the assembler and the assembly strategy
may result in slightly different models that represent a given transcriptome
(Kumar and Blaxter, 2010; Martin and Wang, 2011). Depending on the
type of study, the assembly strategy has to be carefully evaluated and
highlighted assembly results have to be validated for each novel dataset.
T—ACE does offer the option of an automatic BLAST against NCBI databases
and InterProScan, but sequence annotation can be also undertaken outside
T—ACE with sometimes more sophisticated annotation tools (e. g. Blast2Go)
and the results ﬁles are loaded into T—ACE for further analysis (Fig. 1).
For transcriptome comparisons, T—ACE is currently designed to work with a
dataset composed of several transcriptomes of different treatments or tissues,
which are assembled into a consensus transcriptome (Fig. 2). Subsequently,
reads of the different transcriptomes are again mapped against the consensus
transcriptome for information of transcriptome expression pattern i.e. number
of reads per speciﬁc contig. Throughout the text, we will use the term
‘transcriptome’ for sequences (i.e. reads) gained from different samples and
‘consensus transcriptome’ for the contigs gained from the assembly of all
‘transcriptome’ sequences. Together with the annotations this builds the
‘database’.

Example datasets: in the following, we will give examples for different
features of T—ACE using two independent datasets generated by 454
pyrosequencing (Roche/454 Life Sciences). One dataset was generated

transcriptome using the ‘GS De novo Assembler 2.3’ from Roche (Newbler,
Roche/454 Life Sciences) and the TGICL (Cap3) assembler. Subsequently,
tissue—speciﬁc reads were mapped against the consensus transcriptome

by Craft et al. (2010) for the marine mussel Mytilas galloprovincialis
and was downloaded from the MG—RAST portal (download 12/10; http://
metagenomics.nmpdr.org/; Meyer et al., 2008). The second dataset contains
sequences of the marine invader species Sabella spallanzanii and was
sequenced at the Institute of Clinical Molecular Biology (ICMB Kiel,
Germany) in cooperation with the Cawthron Institute (Dr D. Mountfort,
New Zealand). Both datasets can be used to test T—ACE in the cloud.
Detailed instructions how to load the T—ACE client and enter the databases
are given on the T—ACE webpage ( http://www.ikmb.uni—kiel.de/tace/) and in
video tutorials on the webpage. The M. galloprovincialis database contains
sequences of foot, gill, digestive gland and mantle tissue. Sequences
were quality controlled and cleaned for primer and adapter sequences
(Smart primer sequences and 454 adapters) as well as polyA tails by
‘seqclean’ and ‘cln2qual’ (TGI—The Gene Index Project) before the
assembly. Reads <40 bp after the quality control and cleaning were excluded
from further sequence assembly and annotation. The trimmed reads were
assembled with the ‘GS De novo Assembler 2.3’ from Roche (Newbler,
Roche/454 Life Sciences), as a ﬁrst step. The standard parameters of
the ‘GS De novo Assembler 2.3’ were used for this initial assembly
(‘minimum overlap length’ = 40; ‘minimum overlap identity’ 2 90).
Afterwards the resulting contigs and singletons were further assembled
in multiple rounds using the TGICL (Cap3) assembler. The ‘minimum
overlap length’ varied between 40 and 300 bp and the ‘minimum overlap
identity’ between 85 and 100%. In total, 104123 MG—RAST sequences
(average length 211 bp) of M. galloprovincialis were assembled into 12 827
contigs (average length 279 bp) and 40 972 singletons (average length
207 bp). Using AMOS (http://sourceforge.net), reads originating from the
different tissues were subsequently mapped against the generated contigs
and the Mytilas edalis mitochondrion genome (GI:55977238), which
resulted in the ﬁnal contigs and assigned reads from the different tissues
(Fig. 2). The S.spallanzanii dataset contains 86 490 read sequences deduced
from fan tissue which were assembled into 4714 contigs and 21086
singletons. More detailed information of both datasets is given on the
T—ACE webpage. For both datasets, putative gene names and protein
domains were assigned to all contigs by using the BLASTx algorithm
against the UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot and UniRef100 protein databases of
UniProt Knowledgebase (UniProtKB, http://www.expasy.org/sprot/) with a
cut off e g 10‘3,as well as tBLASTx (e g 10-3) and BLASTn (e g 10-10)
against the NCBI nucleotide database (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). The
S.spallanzanii dataset was further analyzed for conserved domains by
running the assembled contigs through InterProScan (1). GO terms were
deduced from BLAST and InterProScan results and KEGG information
from GO and BLAST results. Datasets as well as required databases (e.g.
reference list, GO term list, etc.) for performing the below described analyses
can be downloaded from the T—ACE webpage ( http://www.ikmb.uni—kiel.
de/tace/#Package/).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Working with T-ACE

Single sequence reads or assembled contigs, with their
corresponding reads (e.g. ACE and SAM ﬁles), can be uploaded
into the database together with information of independently
performed BLAST— and protein domain—annotations. The current
version of T—ACE, for example, supports the Blast2Go annot. and
InterProScan ﬁles. Alternatively, BLAST annotation and protein
domain identiﬁcation (InterProScan) can be performed within
T—ACE. When performed in T—ACE, GO and KEGG information is
deduced from the BLAST and InterProScan entries. The nucleotide
and translated protein sequence of individual sequences is then
linked with the respective annotations. Different characters of
a single sequence such as nucleotide and amino acid sequence,
protein domain composition, ORF detection or contig coverage
are visualized and can be curated manually within T—ACE. Such
possibilities allow a detailed inspection and reﬁnement of the results
and goes beyond what is provided by other database interfaces,
such as TRIPAL, Gbrowse or tbrowse (http://code.google.com/p/
tbrowse/). At the whole database level, a complete overview of
the sequence, GO term and KEGG pathway composition can be
calculated and visualized within the interface. Data can be easily
extracted for further external analysis and graphical processing.
To identify genes of interest within the database, the tool offers
the option for key word— or BLAST—searches. T—ACE is especially
designed for the comparison of transcriptomes of non—model
organisms without genome or large sequence information. Software
solutions for such transcriptome comparisons are currently still
missing, but are urgently needed due to the decreasing costs
and increasing sequence numbers in NGS. T—ACE offers a ﬁrst
solution by using the information of the number of transcriptome
speciﬁc single reads assigned to a deﬁned contig, and changes in
contig expression can be analyzed and visualized (further details
below). In T—ACE, database organization and analysis is combined.
To organize sequences and results, the tool enables individual
databases to be set up, to sort sequences into projects or export data
on the level of FASTA ﬁles or annotation tables for further analysis
in external software solutions. T—ACE consists of a PostgreSQL
database and a TCL Client interface, which allows multiple users
to access the Postgres server from different computers and/or
various operating systems (Windows/Linux/MacOS). Results
saved within the database or in individual projects can thus be
interchanged between different partners working on Windows,
Linux or Mac platforms. On the one hand, T—ACE is attractive
for laboratory environments, which have only a limited amount
of bioinformatic support and for cooperating partners working
on the same dataset from different locations. On the other, for
laboratories with expertise in bioinformatics and programming,
T—ACE provides a framework that can be extended by adding
further modules, customized according to the different needs of
the user and transcriptome project. The low complexity of the
database allows an easy understanding of its structure and therefore
facilitates the extension and integration of new tables and functions.

about the database content, such as the number and average
length of nucleotide, protein and read sequences are displayed
in the ‘Database info’ window (Supplementary Fig. S2). Number
of annotation entries from externally performed analysis, or after
BLAST and InterProScan annotation within T—ACE, are displayed
according to the origin (e. g. GO, KEGG, Pfam). All databases can
be exported directly from T—ACE, which facilitates the interchange
or further analysis of data outside T—ACE. The ‘Database info’
window also gives information of the transcriptomes (e. g. different
treatments, tissues, populations) included in the database. These
are displayed in the ‘run’—table and can be selected for whole
database analysis and comparison between different transcriptomes
(Supplementary Fig. S2). In the following, we will describe T—ACE
functions by using a nucleotide database. It is also possible, however,
to create a pure protein database or view a nucleotide database in
a protein mode. By switching a nucleotide database into ‘protein’—
mode, the nucleotide sequence list of the ‘Database browser’ will be
replaced by a list of all protein sequences contained in the database.
In this way, annotations for distinct open reading frames of a contig
can, for example, be reviewed.

Database sequence statistics: to get a ﬁrst insight in how different
RNAseq datasets/libraries compose the database, the nucleotide
coverage and percentage of partially covered contigs of the
consensus transcriptome can be calculated for transcriptomes
selected within the ‘run’ table (Supplementary Fig. S3), and is
executed via the ‘Coverage’ button. A more detailed statistical
analysis about the database content is performed in the ‘Database
statistics’ window. This menu allows an overview of sequence
frequency on the level of reads or contigs, as well as contig and
whole transcriptome coverage on the level of reads and nucleotides.
Results are visualized as graphs within the tool or can be displayed
as a list (Supplementary Fig. S4) and exported from T—ACE as
txt/tables for analysis in external software solutions (e. g. Excel or
GraphPad Prism).

Database GO statistics: in the GO statistics, the number of contigs
of a speciﬁc GO term is listed and visualized for all levels of the
GO tree (Supplementary Fig. SS). GO terms are deduced from the
BLAST and InterProScan results of the consensus transcriptome
and sorted into the different subcategories for molecular function,
cellular component and biological process. Contigs detected within
lower levels of the GO tree are also listed in the parent directory at
higher levels of the GO tree but not counted twice. Alternatively,
GO analysis can be conducted in Blast2GO and .annot ﬁles loaded
into T—ACE. The GO table is graphically visualized or the list
can be directly copied and imported in external software tools for
graphical processing (e. g. for the generation of GO pie charts).
Contigs belonging to a speciﬁc GO term can be directly exported
by right mouse click into a new project ﬁle for detailed inspection.
To investigate whether a group of speciﬁc contigs e. g. which show
extremely high expression levels, represent distinct GO terms,
entries of a project tab can be added as red bars to the GO
tree diagram of the consensus transcriptome with the ‘Compare’—
button. A more detailed comparison of GO term patterns between
and within RNAseq datasets can, however, be undertaken in the
‘Run compare’ tool, which is described below in the section of
transcriptome comparisons.

Database KEGG maps and composition: to analyze the
gene composition and regulation of speciﬁc pathways within
transcriptome data, the analysis of contigs on the basis of reference
pathways from the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) was implemented in T—ACE. KEGG pathway annotations
for speciﬁc genes originate from the respective BLAST and/or GO
annotations. Within the ‘KEGG map’ menu, an overview of all
KEGG pathways identiﬁed in the consensus transcriptome is given
together with the number of contigs covering this pathway. Further,
the user gets an overview on which number and percentage (ko,
ko%) of all pathway members within a speciﬁc reference pathway
is covered by the contigs of the consensus transcriptome. Contigs
are listed when clicking on the pathway to allow a more detailed
investigation of the transcripts. Both tables have web links to either
a pathway or a speciﬁc KEGG Orthology (KO)—ID (http://www
.genome.jp/kegg/).

3.2.2 Organization and overview of sequence information The
organization and structured overview of sequence data within a
database is an important component of T—ACE. In the ‘Database
Browser’ window, all sequence entries of the database are listed
together with the associated information such as sequence length
and, in case of contigs, number of reads, as well as the number of
different annotations (e.g. BLAST, GO, InterPro).

Working with single sequences and contigs: selection of a sequence
entry will open detailed associated information like BLAST, GO
and KEGG hits, InterProScan results, domain structure, read
coverage and user—speciﬁc comments in different tabs in the lower
windows of T—ACE (Fig. 3). Pop—up windows visualizing sequence
read—coverage and ORF information can be opened by right click
on single sequences (Fig. 4). Further options for processing single
sequences can be selected e.g. by adding the sequence to the
BLAST window or creating primers with Primer 3. This enables
an immediate access and processing of different associated data of
a sequence entry. Single and multiple sequences can be transferred
and saved in a project ﬁle, which will help the user to organize
groups of sequences. Project ﬁles can then be, for example,
exchanged between research partners working on the same database
but different platforms (Windows/Linux/MacOS).

Search for target genes or protein domains: T—ACE offers database
searches for target genes or protein domains either via keyword
search or BLAST analysis. Keyword searches can be performed
with user—speciﬁc ﬁlters for e—values or type of annotation in which
should be searched (e.g. BLAST, KEGG). To perform BLAST
searches with T—ACE, either a BLAST server or a local installation
of NCBI— BLAST+ can be used and the required T—ACE databases
have to be available as BLAST databases. For a local BLAST
installation, this can easily be done by using the ‘Create BLAST
database’—module. The standard BLAST parameters are set through
the ‘BLAST parameters’—option in the ‘Conﬁg’—menu. If a BLAST
server is used for BLAST—analysis (selected in the ‘Conﬁg’—menu
‘BLAST conﬁguration’), the ‘Database’—combo box will contain
a list of every database available to the user. When using the
‘Local’—option, only databases situated in the BLAST_dbs folder
in the T—ACE directory are listed in the ‘Database’—combo box.
BLAST results are displayed in a separate window in which
the alignment of the BLAST matches can be given. By running
the ‘Mapping’ option, the position of the different matches on the

query can be visualized (Supplementary Fig. S6). Within BLAST,
the selection of ‘overlaps only’ enables a result ﬁlter that, when
activated, displays only BLAST hits which reach the start or end
of the query sequence. This option is useful when searching for
sequences elongating a given query.

3.2.3 Transcriptome comparison An important aspect when
working with RNAseq datasets from different samples (e. g.
different tissues or treatments) is the easy accessibility of
information about transcriptomal changes in pathways described
by GO/KEGG terms, changes in domain abundance and gene
expression on the contig level. Besides T—ACE, only the Blast2GO
tool offers a ﬁrst statistical analysis between transcriptomes. This

is, however, restricted to GO-terms. In T—ACE, the information of
sequence reads from different transcriptomes assigned to speciﬁc
contigs of the consensus transcriptome within the database is needed
as a prerequisite for transcriptome analysis. In case of a de novo
assembly, as done for M.galloprovincialis and S.spallanzanii, all
reads from the different transcriptomes are assembled into contigs
and the information of transcriptome-speciﬁc reads per database
contig are extracted (Fig. 2). In T—ACE, different options for
transcriptome comparisons are implemented that can be executed
in the ‘Database statistic’ window or the ‘Tool’ drop-down menu.

Expression analysis: the ‘Expression analysis’ tool investigates the
origin, i.e. transcriptomal dataset afﬁliation of reads contained in
a contig. For this, transcriptomes of the run table in the ‘Database

Fig. 5. Visualization of expression analysis when comparing different
transcriptomes. As an example, the gill tissue transcriptome of the
M. galloprovincialis database was set as group A and digestive gland tissue as
group B and the fold change calculated for contigs >100 bp and containing
minimum 20 reads. Each dot represents a sequence entry. Dots can be
selected by mouse click and the information associated to the respective
sequence is displayed in the different windows of T—ACE.

info’—window are marked as deﬁned groups (A or B). Results can be
displayed as the number of ‘A and ‘B reads per contig on the linear
or logarithmic scale as well as fold change in a list or graph (Fig. 5).
If the compared transcriptomes are composed of a different number
of assembled sequences, T—ACE gives the option to calculate the
results on normalized values. The results can be ﬁltered by e.g.
setting minimum contig length, read number or the fold change
threshold. Statistical analysis is undertaken when the A and B
group each consists >2 transcriptomes. Fold change values are
calculated for mean or median values and a P—value for signiﬁcantly
up— or downregulated contigs between groups is calculated by
the Mann—Whitney U test. P—values are corrected for multiple
testing using the Benjamini—Hochberg Step—Up false discovery
rate—controlling procedure. Due to the still high sequencing costs,
however, generally a low number of transcriptomes per treatment
group (biological replicates) are generated, which is in most cases
not suitable for statistical calculation and leading to non— signiﬁcant
P—values (P > 0.05) for up— or downregulated genes. To yet reduce
the number of genes to be chosen for a subsequent more detailed
investigation of expression changes e.g. by real time PCR, T—ACE
holds the option to ﬁlter for ‘distinct’ differences. The number of
reads per contig within groups A and B are ranked and the two
groups are 100% distinctly different when the transcriptome with
the lowest number of reads for a speciﬁc contig within one group
(e. g. A) still has a higher number of reads compared with the
transcriptome with the highest number of reads per contig in the
other group (e.g. B). The percentage (%) of distinction can be set
by the user. The obtained sequence entries for regulated genes can
be transferred to separate project tabs by the ‘Show UP’— and/or
‘Show DOWN’—button for further analysis or export.

Analysis of GO term, KEGG pathway member or protein domain
distribution within and between transcriptomes: in some cases, the
composition of GO terms, KEGG pathway members or protein
domains in different transcriptomal datasets or in the group of up—
and downregulated genes of treatments can be more informative
than investigating expression changes on the level of single genes.
A high number of small expression changes of several genes within

one pathway may not be detected as a major result when only
looking at the single genes, but may be striking when investigated
on the whole pathway level. The ‘Run compare’ tool compares
multiple subsets of contigs (called cohorts) against the combined
contigs of all subsets. This gives a statistical estimation on which
GO terms, KEGG pathways or domains are enriched or depleted
within the respective transcriptome or treatment group. Calculations
can be conducted for the whole set of different GO terms and
KEGG pathways, or for speciﬁc GO levels and KEGG pathways.
P—values are calculated by performing the Fisher’s exact test. In
Figure 6A, a typical run compare table is shown with signiﬁcant
enriched— or depleted—GO terms marked in green (enriched) or
red (depleted). Data obtained by the run compare tool can then
be exported for further analysis and graphical display as, for
example, undertaken for the GO subcategory ‘Molecular function’
for different tissues of M.galloprovincialis (Fig. 6B). A similar
approach is undertaken in the Blast2GO software, which uses
GOSSIP (Bluthgen et al., 2005) to compare enriched GO terms
between two datasets. BioMyn (http://www.biomyn.de/explorel)
and skypainter (http://www.reactome.org/cgi—bin/skypainter2) are
other online tools in which two lists of genes with identiﬁers can be
uploaded for GO and pathway analysis. The analysis is, however,
restricted to a limited number of species and excludes GO, KEGG
and domain analysis of sequences without a proper gene BLAST hit
i.e. with only a domain annotation. The advantage in T—ACE is that
the two datasets to be compared do not need to be annotated and
loaded separately but are within one T—ACE project. The calculation
is not based on the gene identiﬁer of a distinct species but on
the previous performed GO, KEGG and domain annotation and
further, not only overrepresentation but also underrepresentation of
the respective terms or pathways is calculated.

3.3 Conclusion and outlook

The T—ACE was especially developed for NGS transcriptome
projects of non—model organisms where signiﬁcant a priori
sequence information is missing on DNA and RNA level. We
wanted to design a software tool, which goes beyond a webpage
application for gene mining by keyword or BLAST searches. We
also explicitly did not aim to compete with larger central sequence
databases (e.g. short read archives of EBI and NCBI) that allow
sharing of the unannotated data with the wider public. T—ACE was
built in order to provide a graphical interface that can be used
locally among different scientists in a single lab and also between
collaborating laboratories in order to work with large amounts
of transcriptome sequence data. T—ACE exhibits modules for
manual curation and visualization of single contigs and underlying
reads. Furthermore, statistical tools have been implemented for the
analysis of differential expression or occurrence of GO, KEGG
terms and protein domains comparison of transcriptomes. The
relatively simple bioinformatic structure sets a framework for
further integration of analysis modules and customization of the
tool. Future development of T—ACE will particularly focus on such
additional modules for transcriptome comparisons in the light of
the increasing use of RNAseq data as ‘virtual microarrays’ i.e. a
consensus transcriptome will be used as a ‘virtual microarray’
against which sequence data of short—read sequencing technologies
(e. g. SoliD, Illumina) are mapped for gene expression analysis.

Taken together, T—ACE has been designed for scientists in
different laboratories working cooperatively on a central database
and allows its users access from different terminals and platforms
(Linux/Windows/MacOS).

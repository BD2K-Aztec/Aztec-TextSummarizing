ABSTRACT

Summary: We present a novel Golgi-prediction server, GolgiP,
for computational prediction of both membrane- and non-
membrane—associated Golgi-resident proteins in plants. We have
employed a support vector machine-based classification method
for the prediction of such Golgi proteins, based on three types
of information, dipeptide composition, transmembrane domain(s)
(T MDs) and functional domain(s) of a protein, where the functional
domain information is generated through searching against the
Conserved Domains Database, and the TMD information includes
the number of TMDs, the length of TMD and the number of TMDs at
the N-terminus of a protein. Using GolgiP, we have made genome-
scale predictions of Golgi-resident proteins in 18 plant genomes, and
have made the preliminary analysis of the predicted data.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Golgi apparatus is an essential cellular organelle found in most,
if not all, eukaryotic cells, serving as an intermediate station of
the secretory pathway that transports proteins out of a cell. Besides,
Golgi is also a major site for protein post-translational modiﬁcations
(e.g. glycosylation; Nilsson et al., 2009) and synthesis of various
polysaccharides. The plant cell walls are mainly comprised of
lignins, glycosylated proteins and polysaccharides, most of which
are synthesized in Golgi (Lerouxel et al., 2006).

Identiﬁcation of the Golgi-resident proteins represents a very
challenging and a highly important problem for the understanding
of the biological processes taking place in Golgi. Although there are
1183 mouse and human Golgi-resident proteins identiﬁed (Sprenger
et al., 2007), only a little over 400 plant Golgi proteins have been
experimentally identiﬁed. A key challenging issue is that plant
Golgi proteins do not seem to have obvious targeting signals as
proteins targeted at other cellular compartments, such as nucleus
or extra-cellular space. Most of the existing computational tools
for subcellular localization predictions are designed for the general
subcellular localization prediction, and their predictions for Golgi—
resident proteins are less than adequate (Sprenger et al., 2006).
Only one program has been speciﬁcally designed for the prediction

of Golgi-localized proteins but it focuses only on transmembrane
Golgi proteins (Yuan and Teasdale, 2002). The issue is that only
25% of Golgi proteins of Arabidopsis thaliana are estimated to
contain transmembrane regions (Schwacke et al., 2003), indicating
the inadequacy of the current programs. Based on this consideration,
we have designed a support vector machine (SVM)—based classiﬁer,
called GolgiP, to predict both Golgi-localized transmembrane
proteins and non-transmembrane proteins. G01 giP currently provides
multiple models for predicting plant Golgi proteins, based on the
speciﬁc needs of a user.

2 METHODS AND DATASET

We have collected a large dataset comprising of 402 known Golgi proteins
and 5703 known non-Golgi proteins of A.thaliana (91.2%), Oryza sativa
(8.2%) and other plants (0.7%), from the SUBA (Heazlewood et al., 2007)
and the UniProt (preiler et al., 2004) databases, as well as manually curated
from the published literature. The non-Golgi proteins are proteins that have
subcellular localization annotations, but not in Golgi according to the above
databases. The redundant sequences in our dataset are removed by CD-hit
using 95% sequence identity as the cut-off (Li and Godzik, 2006). Four-ﬁfth
of the data was used to train the classiﬁer and the remaining one-ﬁfth was
used to test the trained classiﬁer, where the dataset was randomly partitioned
into training and test datasets.

To train an SVM-based classiﬁer for Golgi proteins, we have examined
three different sets of features, all computed from protein sequences. The
ﬁrst set of features is related to the dipeptide composition (DiAA). For each
protein in our training set, we calculated the composition of dipeptides.
The second set of features is related to transmembrane domains (TMDs).
We used TMHMM (Krogh et al., 2001) and Phobius (Kall et al., 2004)
to predict the number of TMDs, the average length of TMDs, the number
of TMDs within the N-terminal region consisting of 70 amino acids, the
length of the ﬁrst TMD within the N-terminal region, and the orientation
of the N-terminal (i.e. in the cytosol side or in the Golgi lumen side). The
third set of features is related to functional domains (FunD). We searched
proteins in our datasets against the Conserved Domains Database (CDD)
using RPS-BLAST (Marchler—Bauer et al., 2009) with an e—value cutoff
<0.01. We did this because the Golgi apparatus is where proteins get post-
translational modiﬁcations such as glycosylation (Nilsson et al., 2009), and
where the syntheses of most polysaccharides take place (Nilsson et al., 2009).
In addition, Komatsu et al. (2007) found that the distributions of functional
categories of proteins are different in different membranes such as plasma
membrane, vascular membrane and Golgi membrane, respectively. Hence,
it is expected that enzymes for the Golgi-related activities should be located
in Golgi. The CDDs found for the Golgi proteins are then collected as the
third set of features.

We applied the LIBSVM package (Fan et al., 2005) to train the classiﬁer.
We used the Radial Basis Function kernel, and tuned the cost (c) and gamma
(y) parameters to optimize the classiﬁcation performance on the training
dataset.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

We used the aforementioned three sets Of sequence features, and
trained three SVM classiﬁcation models. Besides, we combined all
three sets Of features tO train a comprehensive model. The training
performances are shown in Supplementary Material.

We have compared the models with the other Golgi protein
prediction tOOls, including PSORT (Nakai and Horton, 1999), WOLF
PSORT (Horton et al., 2007) and Yuan’s Golgi predictor (Yuan and
Teasdale, 2002) by using the testing dataset.

As shown in Table 1, Yuan’s Golgi predictor has the good
sensitivity but the lowest speciﬁcity and the lowest accuracy.
PSORT and WOLF PSORT are two general subcellular localization
prediction tOOls, and have moderate level Of classiﬁcation
performance, which may not be adequate tO serve as a plant GOlgi
protein predictor based on our analysis. Our program, GolgiP,
exhibits the better overall performances with a higher accuracy and
Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (MCC).

We have applied GOlgiP with the functional domain mOdel
tO predict GOlgi proteins on 18 selected fully sequenced plant
genomes using the same cutoff. The reason we chose the functional
domain mOdel is that the mOdel performs the best speciﬁcity, and
therefore tends tO aVOid false positive results in this genome-wide
prediction. The numbers and percentages Of the predicted GOlgi
proteins in these organisms are shown in Table 2. Across algae, moss,
monocot and dicot plants, the average percentages Of predicted GOlgi
proteins is 7.25% among all the encoded proteins by these genomes.
The stability in the percentage Of the predicted GOlgi proteins
across different genomes indirectly suggests the reliability Of our
predictions. The trend Of distribution Of GOlgi proteins from lower tO
higher plant species shows the similar percentage Of GOlgi proteins.
This may suggest that the functionality Of the GOlgi apparatus has
eVOlved and matured fairly early in the plant evolution.

In conclusion, we developed a GOlgi protein prediction tOOl,
GOlgiP, and demonstrated its superior performance in predicting
plant GOlgi proteins over the existing prediction servers. In addition,
our predictions across multiple plant genomes give an estimation
Of the percentage Of plant GOlgi proteins across different plant
organisms, which is in general agreement with the previous
estimations.

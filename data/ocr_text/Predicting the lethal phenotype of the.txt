ABSTRACT

Motivation: The phenotypes of knockout mice provide crucial
information for understanding the biological functions of mammalian
genes. Among various knockout phenotypes, lethality is of great
interest because those involved genes play essential roles. With the
availability of large-scale genomic data, we aimed to assess how
well the integration of various genomic features can predict the lethal
phenotype of single-gene knockout mice.

Results: We first assembled a comprehensive list of 491 candidate
genomic features derived from diverse data sources. Using mouse
genes with a known phenotype as the training set, we integrated
the informative genomic features to predict the knockout lethality
through three machine learning methods. Based on cross-validation,
our models could achieve a good performance (accuracy = 73% and
recall = 63%). Our results serve as a valuable practical resource in
the mouse genetics research community, and also accelerate the
translation of the knowledge of mouse genes into better strategies
for studying human disease.

1 INTRODUCTION

The mouse is the premier model organism for interpreting the human
genome and plays a key role in studying human diseases (Collins
et al., 2007). Importantly, the mouse is the only vertebrate species
in which pre—selected genes can be deliberately mutated (knocked
out) such that the phenotypic effect associated with a gene can be
deﬁned in a precise manner. Among various phenotypic effects of
disrupting a mouse gene, the lethal phenotype is of particular interest
for several reasons. First, the lethal phenotype represents the most
severe defects for an organism; the disrupted genes that result in the
lethality play essential roles. From an evolutionary point of View, the
loss of such a gene reduces the ﬁtness of the organism to zero (Liao
and Zhang, 2008). Second, computational analyses on the lethal
phenotype of gene deletion reveal some key ﬁndings in systems
biology, such as the ‘centrality—lethality’ rule (Jeong et al., 2001)

and functional compensation among duplicated genes (Gu et al.,
2003). Third, at the practical level, predicting the knockout lethality
of mouse genes is highly valuable for the mouse genetics community
since mouse knockout experiments are notoriously time—consuming.

Previous analyses on the knockout lethality of mouse genes have
focused on one or a few gene features. For example, Liang and Li
(2007) showed a weak correlation between the knockout lethality
and protein connectivity. Furthermore, whether a gene is a singleton
has little effect on the predictive power of knockout lethality
(Liang and Li, 2007; Liao and Zhang, 2007), implying a complex
relationship between gene duplicability and gene essentiality
(Makino et al., 2009). More recently, with the availability of various
large—scale mouse genomic datasets, there has been wide interest
in employing sophisticated computational approaches to predicting
gene function by considering many gene features simultaneously.
One pioneering attempt was the ‘MouseFunc Prediction’ project
(Hughes and Roth, 2008) in which different bioinformatics teams
integrated diverse datasets to predict the biological functions of
mouse genes [represented as gene ontology (GO) terms] using
advanced machine learning approaches such as ridge regression
(Mostafavi et al., 2008), support vector machine (SVM) (Guan et
al., 2008) and random forest (Tasan et al., 2008). These studies made
reliable predictions for many GO categories and greatly expanded
our ability to discover novel biology (Pena—Castillo et al., 2008).

The primary biological questions we aim to address are as
follows: (i) which genomic features are most correlated with
the lethal phenotype of mouse single—gene knockouts; and (ii)
through reasonable computational approaches, to what extent can
the knockout lethality be predicted from a wide range of genomic
features? Figure 1 outlines the overall scheme of our study. We
ﬁrst assembled a comprehensive list of genomic features derived
from diverse data sources for each mouse gene, and identiﬁed
subsets of informative features for predicting the lethality of
single—gene knockouts. Then we integrated the selected genomic
features to predict the knockout lethality using three machine
learning methods and evaluated their predictive power based on
cross—validation. Finally, we examined the bias of genes with a
known knockout phenotype (the training set) and estimated the
bias—corrected predictive power. Our predictive models achieved a
reasonably good performance, demonstrating the feasibility of an
integrative approach to predicting knockout lethality in complex
organisms.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data collection

Phenotype information of knockout mice was obtained from the Mouse
Genome Informatics (MGI) database (http://www.informatics.jax.org). Our
analysis included only targeted homozygous knockouts (both copies of a gene
were inactivated). The phenotype of a single—gene knockout was classiﬁed
as lethal if the gene was associated with a lethality annotation (including
embryonic/perinatal, prenatal/perinatal and postnatal lethality); otherwise, it
was classiﬁed as non—lethal.

The gene coding sequence, protein domain, gene homology and structural
information were downloaded from Ensembl (release 59), and only those
with a one—to—one MGI symbol and Ensembl ID correspondence were
retained in the analysis. Gene duplicability was represented by two features:
the number of paralogs and paralog sequence identity (the sequence identity
with the closest paralog in the mouse genome). The gene evolutionary
age was classiﬁed into 12 categories based on the presence/absence of
the homologs of mouse genes in 11 representative eukaryotic species
(including rat, rabbit, human, elephant, dog, chicken, frog, zebraﬁsh, ﬂy,
worm and yeast) as previously described (Cai et al., 2009). Selective
pressure was indexed by dN/dS between mouse and rat orthologous genes.
Hydrophobicity, codon adaptation index, codon bias, effective number of
codons, GC content, length of the putative protein in amino acids, frequency
of optimal codons and aromaticity were calculated using CodonW (Peden,
1999). For the genes with multiple transcripts, the longest transcript and
protein sequences were used in the analysis. The special codons refer to
codons with a third—nucleotide mutation from a stop codon, including TAC
and TAT encoding Tyr, TGC and TGT encoding Cys, and TGG encoding Trp.
The protein helix, sheet and coil content were predicted with PROthd (Rost
and Sander, 1994), and the disordered regions in proteins were predicted by
RONN (Yang et al., 2005). The protein charge (theoretical isoelectric point)
was calculated with ExPAsy Proteomics Server (Gasteiger et al., 2003). The
length of 5/— or 3/—UTR was calculated based on RefSeq transcripts. The
CpG island annotation was obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser, and
a CpG island was assigned to a gene if it was within 10—kb upstream from the
gene start. MicroRNA target sites were predicted with TargetScanS (Lewis
et al., 2005) and grouped by microRNA families, and the existence of each
type of microRNA target site, as well as the total number of target—site types

was calculated for each gene. Mouse recombination rate data were obtained
from Cox et al. (2009). Information about conserved transcription factor
binding sites was downloaded with TRANSFAC track in the UCSC Genome
Browser, and the existence of each type of binding site, as well as the total
number of binding—site types was calculated for each gene.

The expression data of the mouse transcriptome (Affymetrix GNF1M
chips) were downloaded from the NCBI GEO database (Su et al., 2004),
which included 61 tissue types (spatial expression). The average expression
level (both mean and median values), maximum expression level, tissue
expression breadth and speciﬁcity were calculated as previously described
(Liao et al., 2006). The temporal expression data for different developmental
stages (TSl—TS26, TS28) were obtained from the MGI Gene Expression
Database (Finger et al., 2011), and for each developmental stage, genes were
classiﬁed as detected, undetected or unavailable, respectively. A summary
feature about whether a gene was expressed before birth (TSl—TS26) was
also included.

Mouse protein interaction data are quite incomplete; therefore, human
protein interaction data from the Human Protein Reference Database
(Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) were transferred to mouse genes through
one—to—one human—to—mouse orthology, as annotated in Ensembl (Flicek
et al., 2011). Based on the protein interaction network hereby obtained,
betweenness, connectivity and clustering coefﬁcients were calculated. Data
about histone modiﬁcations (including two types, H3k4me1 and H3k4me3,
in 10 tissues) were obtained from the ENCODE Project (Birney et al., 2007),
and a histone modiﬁcation peak was assigned to a gene if it was within a gene
or 10—kb upstream from the gene start. The existence of histone modiﬁcations
in each tissue and the total number of histone modiﬁcations across all the
tissues were calculated for each gene.

2.2 Machine learning methods

We selected informative genomic features using the least absolute shrinkage
and selection operator (LASSO) penalty by Tibshirani (1996). An important
property of this penalty, generating coefﬁcient estimates of exactly zero
(Knight and Fu, 2000), makes it attractive for feature selection. LASSO
reduces the estimation variance while providing an interpretable ﬁnal model.
Its application to genomic data (Ghosh and Chinnaiyan, 2005; Shevade and
Keerthi, 2003) has shown that selecting a small number of representative
features can achieve satisfactory classiﬁcation. We applied the R package
‘glmnet’ (Friedman et al., 2010) to perform LASSO feature selection.
We ﬁrst obtained the regularization path over a grid of values, through
5—fold cross—validation (n—folds = 5), with the response variable as a binary
factor (family 2 ‘binomial’), standardize = FALSE (since all the numerical
variables in the datasets had been pre—standardized) and the other parameters
set by default. The minimum value of the tuning parameter lambda, which
was obtained by a previous cross—validation procedure, was then used to
ﬁt the model. All the features with non—zero coefﬁcients were retained for
subsequent analyses.

Logistic regression is a generalized linear model for binomial regression
that has been widely used to model the outcomes of a categorical dependent
variable. We used the R package, ﬁtting generalized linear models ‘glm’, to
build logistic regression classiﬁers with standard settings.

SVM has shown promising empirical performance by providing non—
linear boundaries in a large, transformed version of the feature space.
According to Schoklkopf et al. (1997), SVM achieves higher recognition
accuracy in classiﬁcation compared with some other popular methods. In
particular, kernel—based SVM is an easy and efﬁcient way for such a mapping
in a higher dimensional space. We used the R package ‘e1071’ to build the
SVM classiﬁers. Since the effectiveness of SVM largely depends on the
selection of kernel and model parameters, we explored the four most common
kernel forms (linear, polynomial, Gaussian radial and sigmoid basis). It
turned out that the radial kernel with degree 2 achieved the best results.
The other parameters were set as defaults.

A random forest is a collection of decision trees such that each tree is
built from a random subset of the data. The random forest technique was

ﬁrst introduced in 2001 (Breiman, 2001), and since then has been shown
to be a highly accurate classiﬁer in a number of ﬁelds, including genetics
(Bureau et al., 2005). One important reason we employed the random forest
method in this study is because it effectively and validly accommodates
a large number of features. This advantage was of particular interest in
our study since there were 491 possible informative features. We used
the ‘randomForest’ package in R and chose parameter values according to
Breiman’s methodology. Although the default number of trees is 500, we
chose to build 5000 trees (ntree = 5000) to obtain more robust results. As
more trees are added, it converges almost surely to the probability that the
forest classiﬁes the response correctly. Each tree was grown to its full depth
(nodesize = 1) and was not pruned. At each node of each tree, a different
random subset of the features was selected, and the Gini criterion was used
to determine the feature in this subset that produced the best split of the data.
The size of this subset (mtry) was the square root of the number of possible
features. The other parameters were set as defaults.

The performance of the various classiﬁers was evaluated based on
complete 5—fold cross—validation: during each of ﬁve iterations, feature
selection (by LASSO as described earlier) and model selection was based on
80% of the training data and model evaluation was based on the remaining
20% of the data. Since the random forest classiﬁer outperformed the other
two in terms of AUC, the ﬁnal prediction for genes without annotated
phenotype was made with the random forest classiﬁer. The predicted values
were originally reported as probabilities, and to make binary predictions
(0, non—lethal and 1, lethal), we chose the cutoff values by maximizing the
overall classiﬁcation accuracy.

2.3 Bias correction for the predictive power

To assess the bias between genes in the training and predicting sets in
terms of a speciﬁc genomic feature, mutual information was calculated by
the R module ‘entropy’ via binning, and the feature was treated as if it
was a discrete variable. For each of the seven feature sets, the accuracy
(Acc), positive predictive value (PPV), negative predictive value (NPV)
and recall of a random forest classiﬁer were calculated as follows: through
ﬁve iterations in the cross—validation, a binary prediction was made on
each gene in the training set; given the annotated knockout phenotypes,
the 2 x 2 outcome contingency table was obtained, which contained the
numbers of true positives (TPs), false positives (FPs), true negatives (TNs)
and false negatives (FNs); Acc 2 (TP + TN)/(P + N), PPV = TP/(TP + FP),
NPV = TN/(TN + FN), recall 2 TP/(TP + FN). The age—bias—corrected
estimates were calculated as follows: Acc = ZAcci ><f,-; PPV = EPPVl- ><f,-;
NPV = ZNPVl- xﬁ; recall 2 Zrecalll- >< ,-; i = 1...12, where Acci, PPV), NPV,-
and recall,- were the measurements for each evolutionary—age gene group in
the training set, respectively, and f,- was the fraction of the corresponding gene
group in the predicting set. The evolutionary age groups 1—6 in the training
set had relatively small gene numbers, so they were combined as a single
group in the analysis. For each gene in the predicting set, the phenotype
was predicted according to the feature set with the best predictive power
(S + I + E > S + I > S + E > S), and the ﬁnal classiﬁers were based on the
whole training set.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁcation of informative genomic features on
the lethality of mouse knockout genes

From the MGI Database, we collected the mouse phenotypic data
of targeted single—gene knockouts. Among 19 845 mouse protein—
coding genes under survey, the 4670 genes with available knockout
phenotypic data were used as the ‘training set’; and the 15 175 genes
without available knockout phenotype information were designated
as the ‘predicting set’. For each mouse gene, we compiled 491
genomic features (Table 1) whenever available, and grouped those

features into the following three categories according to their data
sources. The genomic sequence set (S) contains 373 features, of
which eight are inferred from coding sequences, 30 from protein
sequences and 335 are based on other gene properties, including
the features for gene regulation. The mRNA expression set (E) was
derived from two expression datasets, containing 66 features for the
tissue expression proﬁles and 28 features for the developmental stage
expression proﬁles. The interaction set (1) contains three features
derived from inferred mouse protein—protein interaction data and 21
features about mouse epigenetic histone modiﬁcation interactions.
In the training set, the knockout phenotypes of 1645 genes were
classiﬁed as lethal and those of the remaining 3025 genes as non—
lethal. Although genomic sequence features were available for all
4670 genes in the training set, the expression and interaction features
were available for only some of the genes. We summarized the
gene numbers for which each category of features was available
as follows: 4670 genes have sequence features (deﬁned as the S
gene set); 4037 genes have expression features (E gene set); 3627
genes have protein interaction features (I gene set); 4036 genes
have both sequence and expression features (S + E gene set); 3627
genes have both sequence and interaction features (S + I gene set);
3217 genes have both expression and interaction features (E + I
gene set) and 3217 genes have sequence, expression and interaction
features (S + E + I gene set). Supplementary Table Sl contains all
the phenotype and feature information about the training set.
Among the features we compiled, some may be irrelevant to the
knockout lethality, and some are highly correlated (Supplementary
Fig. Sl) and provide redundant information. Therefore, we next
selected the subset of informative features for each of the
above seven gene sets using LASSO, which is widely used to
simultaneously achieve shrinkage and variable selection (Tibshirani,
1996). (Supplementary Table S2 shows selected features for each
gene set). Table 2 shows the top informative genomic features
selected by LASSO in the S + E + I gene set. When considering
all the features together, the most informative features are some
evolutionary features, such as gene evolutionary age and paralog
sequence identity; the most informative expression feature is the
expression level in utero, followed by the expression level in
developmental stage 15; and the most informative interaction
feature is protein connectivity. Interestingly, some of the top
selected features, such as evolutionary age, were also highly ranked
upon evaluation of their individual correlations with the knockout
lethality; whereas others, such as paralog sequence identity, did not.

3.2 Assessing the phenotype predictive power of
integrated feature assemblies

To address how well different genomic feature sets predict the
lethality of knockout mice, we used three common machine learning
methods (logistic regression, random forest and SVM) to make
the probabilistic prediction as to whether a gene knockout would
result in the lethal phenotype. Based on 5—fold cross—validation
(including the LASSO feature selection step), we evaluated the
predictive power of different feature assemblies by generating ROC
and precision—recall curves (Supplementary Fig. S2). The area under
the ROC curve (AUC) is a standard measure for the predictive power
of different computational methods or different feature assemblies
(the diagonal line in the ROC curve has an AUC value of 0.5,
representing the predictive power of a random guess). The three

“Based on the S + E + I gene set (genes with sequence, expression and interaction
features).

machine learning methods produced the same trend and showed
similar predictive powers across all the feature sets (Fig. 2A).
With an increase in selected features, the random forest method
outperformed the other two methods (Fig. 2B). Since the random
forest method achieved a slightly better performance than the other
methods in most cases, we focused on the results by the random
forest method in the subsequent analyses.

As shown in Figure 2A, the interaction features alone
(AUC; = 0.598) have limited predictive power for knockout
lethality; whereas the sequence features or the expression
features showed much better predictive power (AUCS = 0.738;
AUCE = 0.725). Adding more features to the prediction model
consistently improved its performance (AUCS + E = 0.776,
AUCS + E + 1 = 0.782). For each of the seven feature sets, we
found that the AUC value of the top two informative features is
considerably lower than that of the combination of all the selected
features (Fig. 2C). These results indicate that the integrated feature
assembly has a substantially increased predictive power for mouse
knockout lethality.

3.3 Estimating the bias-corrected predictive power for
the predicting set

If the training set was randomly selected from the mouse genome, we
can estimate the predictive power of our models for genes whose
knockout phenotypes have not been reported (the predicting set)
directly based on cross—validation of the training set. However, this
assumption may not be true because the training set was largely
collected from individual studies. We therefore evaluated the bias
of the surveyed features between genes in the training and predicting
sets. We found that evolutionary age shows a much greater bias than
any other feature (Fig. 3A, Wilcoxon rank test, P = 2.2 X 10‘16).

different methods with an increase in the top selected features (based on

Indeed, the proportions of genes with an ancient evolutionary age
are much higher in the training set than in the predicting set (Fig.
3B). Such a bias is not surprising since knockout experiments are
time—consuming and researchers tend to choose highly conserved
genes for functional investigation.

To more accurately estimate the performance of our random forest
classiﬁers on the predicting set, we performed a bias—correction
step upon the raw estimates of the cross—validation (see details
in Section 2). As shown in Table 3, considering both accuracy

Fig. 3. The bias between genes in the training and predicting sets. (A) The
bias of a genomic feature was quantiﬁed by mutual information based on
the S gene set; and (B) the distribution of different evolutionary—age gene
groups in the training and predicting sets.

and recall, without correcting the bias of evolutionary age, the
S + E + I feature set shows the best performance (accuracy = 72.5%
and recall = 62.9%), and the I feature set shows the lowest
predictive power. After correcting the bias, the predictive power
across different feature assemblies remains similar: the S + I + E
feature set still shows the best performance (accuracy = 70.9% and
recall = 60.7%), followed by the S + I feature set. We predicted the
knockout phenotype (lethal or non—lethal) for 15 175 genes in the
predicting set, according to the available feature set with the best
predictive power for the gene (Supplementary Table S3).

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we predicted the lethal phenotype for single—
gene knockout mice by integrating gene features inferred from
various genomic data sources and achieved a relatively good
performance. Since mouse knockout experiments are notoriously
time—consuming and technically challenging, we expect our results
to serve as a valuable resource for the mouse genetics research
community, greatly helping to optimize experimental designs and

improve biological interpretations. Because of the close genetic and
physiological similarities between mice and humans, our results
would accelerate the translation of the knowledge of mouse genes
into better strategies for studying human disease.

Compared with previous similar studies, our study has some
advantages. First, we systematically investigated a wide range of
candidate genomic features, most of which have not been examined
for their ability to predict the lethal phenotype. Importantly, all
the surveyed features were derived from large—scale independent
experimental data. To avoid circular reasoning, we did not use GO
annotations or phenotype information (e.g. disease association) from
other species by orthology. Second, we explored and compared
different classiﬁers before making ﬁnal predictions, thereby likely
maximizing the predictive power. Third, we explicitly considered
the bias in the training set when assessing the predictive power for
genes without an annotated phenotype.

Our work provides key insights into the genotype—to—phenotype
relationship. First, the top selected features for mouse knockout
lethality are quite different from those for unicellular eukaryotes
(i.e. yeasts). Some dominant predictors for yeast essential genes,
such as GC content (Seringhaus et al., 2006) were not selected in
our models, suggesting that the genotype—to—phenotype relationship
strongly depends on the organismal complexity. Second, many of
the features that were highly ranked in our study are compatible
with those of previous studies. Among these selected features,
gene evolutionary age was the top feature; it was consistently
selected across different gene sets, and also showed the highest
individual correlation with the knockout phenotype. This result
suggests that disrupting an evolutionarily ancient gene tends to
result in a more severe functional consequence. Paralog sequence
identity is the selected feature with the highest negative coefﬁcient,
indicating that removing a gene with a closely related gene
copy tends to be non—lethal, which is consistent with the notion
of ‘functional compensation’ among paralogs. Interestingly, this
feature alone shows little correlation with the knockout phenotype
individually, which is due to the confounding effects of other
features, as discussed previously (Liang and Li, 2009). Protein
connectivity was another highly ranked feature with a positive
contribution to the knockout lethality. Consistent with previous
studies (Jeong et al., 2001), this result highlights the critical
role of hub nodes in a biological system (Barabasi and Oltvai,
2004). In addition to those previously studied features, we also
identiﬁed some important novel features, most of which are related
to gene expression, such as the expression level in utero and in
T815.

The approach we took also has some limitations. First, like other
similar studies, our models were unable to distinguish correlations
from causations. Second, some parameters in our machine learning
algorithms may not be fully explored. Third, we may still miss some
important genomic features, and the feature dataset we compiled
may contain some noise, especially for interaction features. Indeed,
comparing among the three types of features, the sequence features
and expression features show much higher predictive power than
the interaction features. Although we did not explicitly model the
noise within the feature data, the effect of noise was minimized by
considering a comprehensive list of features and employing feature
selection. We expect to revisit this topic and to achieve a better
performance when more high—quality genomic datasets (such as
protein expression data) have become available.

Abstract

Summary: We introduce HiPub, a seamless Chrome browser plug—in that automatically recognizes,
annotates and translates biomedical entities from texts into networks for knowledge discovery. Using
a combination of two different named—entity recognition resources, HiPub can recognize genes, pro—
teins, diseases, drugs, mutations and cell lines in texts, and achieve high precision and recall. HiPub
extracts biomedical entity—relationships from texts to construct context—specific networks, and inte—
grates existing network data from external databases for knowledge discovery. It allows users to add
additional entities from related articles, as well as user—defined entities for discovering new and unex—
pected entity—relationships. HiPub provides functional enrichment analysis on the biomedical entity
network, and link—outs to external resources to assist users in learning new entities and relations.

Availability and Implementation: HiPub and detailed user guide are available at http://hipub.korea.

1 Introduction

Many of the biomedical research papers are about the interactions
between genes, proteins or drugs in a specific biological context.
New hypotheses could be formulated by mining these papers and de—
signing new sets of experiments to validate (or refute) hypotheses in
the knowledge discovery process. However, the volume and rate of
current biomedical publications are far larger and more rapid than
our ability to extract and use them in this knowledge discovery
cycle. For example, PubMed and PubMed Central (PMC) currently
have more than 26 million abstracts and 4 million full—text articles,
respectively, in their collections, and PubMed receives more than
3000 new abstracts per day. Hence, it is impossible for researchers
to manually go through all the records to extract relevant informa—
tion for their research.

To address these challenges, we developed HiPub, a Chrome
browser plug—in that automatically highlights, annotates and trans—
lates biomedical entities (e.g. genes, proteins, drugs and diseases)
from texts into networks for knowledge discovery. Compared with
related tools, HiPub has the following unique features and advan—
tages (Supplementary Table 81):

° HiPub works as a seamless Chrome extension in PubMed/PMC
websites for knowledge discovery and network exploration.

° HiPub recognizes, highlights and annotates an array of
biomedical entities such as genes, diseases, drugs, cell lines and
mutations in PubMed (abstracts) and PMC (abstracts and full
texts).

° HiPub integrates two complementary named—entity recognition
(NER) methods to achieve high precision and recall: PubTator

2 HiPub description

The HiPub system consists of two components: the Chrome browser
extension and the Biomedical NER server. HiPub is designed for
PubMed (abstracts) and PMC (abstracts and full texts), and sup—
ports several journal websites. After HiPub is invoked, it recognizes
the URL, and the document ID (such as PMID or PMCID) is submit-
ted to the HiPub server for processing the document on the fly.

2.1 HiPub chrome extension

2.1.1 Biomedical entity recognition and annotation function

HiPub recognizes and highlights the following biomedical entities from
texts: genes, proteins, drugs, diseases, cell lines and mutations. When a
highlighted entity is selected and clicked, a pop—up window will appear
with basic information about the entity and with links to various exter—
nal databases for additional information. Basic information about enti—
ties was collected from NCBI Gene, MeSH and Cellosaurus (http://
web.expasy.org/cellosaurus). All other detailed information about art—
icles and functions is accessible in a HiPub window which automatic—
ally appears on the bottom right corner of the web browser.

2.1.2 Biomedical entity network

HiPub generates biomedical entity networks based on two
approaches: (1) using the co—occurrence of entities in an opened art—
icle; and (2) utilizing the evidence of entity—relationships from exter—
nal databases. For the co—occurrence approach, HiPub extracts the
relations between entities in a text as these relations represents novel
results reported in the publication. To add known relations to the
publication—specific entity network, HiPub utilizes BEReX (Jeon
et al., 2014) which consolidates entity—relationships from multiple
data sources. By doing so, HiPub summarizes biomedical entities
and their relationships within a specific context (from publication)
and existing knowledge (from external databases).

2.1.3 Augmenting biomedical entity network with

entities from similar articles

To explore the relationships between biomedical entities in related
articles, HiPub utilizes the PubMed API to retrieve 10 articles that
are the most similar to a specific paper. Using the ‘Add Similar
Articles’ tab in the HiPub window, users can read and add entities
to the biomedical entity network. This function allows users to ex—
pand the biomedical entity network, and use other related studies
for discovering new or unexpected interactions between entities.

2.1.4 Augmenting biomedical entity network with

user-defined entities

Similarly, user—defined entities can be easily added to the entity net—
work utilizing BEReX. When a new user—defined entity is added,
the shortest paths between existing entities in the network and the
newly added entity will be automatically displayed, and users can
also further explore the network by linking—out to the BEReX web
serv1ce.

2.1.5 Detailed query for external databases

Users can send a detailed query about the entities recognized by
HiPub to several external databases. HiPub provides three catego—
ries for querying a set of entities in external databases: literature
(PubMed and Google Scholar), enrichment (BEST and gzProfiler)
(Reimand et al., 2007) and network (KEGG, STRING and BEReX).

2.1.6 Functional enrichment analysis of entities

For genes and proteins recognized in a text, HiPub performs enrich-
ment analysis to find the most related KEGG pathway and Gene
Ontology using NCBI Biosystems (Geer et al., 2010).

2.2 Biomedical named entity recognition server

To achieve high precision and recall for named entity recognition
(NER), HiPub integrates two complementary NER tools: PubTator
(Wei et al., 2013) and BEST entity extractor (BEST EE) (Kim et al.,
2015). PubTator is a machine learning—based NER tool that achieves
high recall whereas BEST EE is a dictionary—based NER tool that is
fast and highly precise. Both NER tools support protein/gene, drug
and disease name recognition. PubTator recognizes mutation and
species information, and BEST EE recognizes cell line names.
Integrating the results of both tools enables HiPub to recognize a
broad range of entities. We used BEST EE for HiPub NER and com-
bined the result with PubTator data that was obtained using
PubTator’s RESTful API (Wei et al., 2016) (Supplementary Figure
S1). Since PubTator provides NER data of only PubMed abstracts,
it is unable to recognize entities in only non—abstract parts; however,
BEST EE can recognize such entities.

To evaluate the performance of HiPub NER, we tested it on the
manually curated abstracts from BRONCO (Lee et al., 2016), and
compared it with PubTator and TPX—plus (Joseph et al., 2015). The
evaluation results of the NER methods are shown in Supplementary
Table S2. HiPub achieves high precision, recall and F1—score as com—
pared to PubTator and TPX—plus in this corpus. More details are
available in Supplementary Data (Supplementary Figure S2). See
Supplementary Results for details.

2.3 Implementation and installation

HiPub is implemented as a Chrome extension with JavaScript and is
available at the Chrome Web Store. Cytoscape.js is used for network
visualization and exploration. The HiPub server is implemented using
Java and SPRING U0. It stores all the PubMed abstracts in local stor—
age for rapid and efficient text processing, with daily updates for
newly published articles The HiPub project page contains the user
manual, installation link and other related information (http://hipub.
korea.ac.kr). Figure 1 illustrates a screen shot of HiPub with some fea—
tures highlighted on an abstract. See User Manual for more details.

3 Use case

The research article PMID 23684607 (Andrysik et al., 2013) describes
a functional genetic screen that identifies key genes and regulators in
driving cells toward p53—dependent apoptosis (via BB C3 gene/PUMA
protein) and cell cycle arrest (via CDKNIA gene/p21 protein). From
the screen, the following two new genes that are also key were identi—
fied: (1) TCF3 which is a transcription factor that drives CDKN 1A ex—
pression and suppresses BB C3 expression across multiple cancer cell
types; (2) TRIAPI which is a specific repressor of CDKN 1A. Five genes
(TP53, BBC3, CDKNIA, TCF3 and TRIAPI) were mentioned in the
abstract, and these were correctly recognized, annotated and high-
lighted by HiPub (Supplementary Figure S3). However, in the result of

Fig. 1. Overview of the HiPub application. (a) HiPub annotates and highlights biomedical entities in texts. (b) HiPub will display basic information of a highlighted
entity when the cursor moves over it. (c) HiPub icon for turning on/off this application in the Chrome browser. (d) Users can click the icon to highlight and add
user-defined entities to the biomedical entity network. (e) HiPub will display detailed information of a highlighted entity in a pop-up window when the entity is
clicked. (f) HiPub window visualizes recognized entities in texts as a network, allows users to add entities from similar articles, provides search query links for ex-
ternal databases, and performs enrichment analysis for GO terms/KEGG pathways. (9) The biomedical entity network visualizes the relations between entities in
a text. The network integrates context-specific entity-relationships extracted from the text and known relationships from external databases for discovering know-
ledge. Light blue and grey edges represent context-specific and known entity-relationships, respectively. Width of light blue edges represents the frequency of
co-occurrence between two entities in the text. The darker grey edge represents the number of evidences supported by external sources

PubTator, some of the genes were wrongly annotated (e.g. PUMA is
annotated as a species, not a protein) (Supplementary Figure S4). Next,
HiPub visualized the interactions of these genes as a network by inte—
grating co—occurrence relationships (light blue edges, extracted from the
abstract) and existing knowledge (grey edges, obtained from external
databases). The novel interactions between TCF3 and CDKN 1 A, TCF3
and BB C3, TRIAP1 and CDKN 1A were identified from the study. The
entity network, which is the basic summary of the abstract (context—spe—
cific), faithfully captures these interactions (Supplementary Figure SS).
In contrast, the existing databases (e.g. STRING) do not contain all the
interactions (Supplementary Figure S6). Therefore, HiPub can be used
as a tool to assist users in extracting important entity relationships from
both texts and external databases, and integrating relations from related
articles for knowledge discovery. See Supplementary Data for details
and additional use case examples.

In summary, we have developed HiPub, a novel web browser
plug—in that automatic recognizes, annotates and translates PubMed
abstracts and PMC full—text articles into biomedical entity networks
for knowledge discovery.

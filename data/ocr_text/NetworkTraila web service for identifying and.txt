ABSTRACT

Summary: The deregulation of biochemical pathways plays a central
role in many diseases like cancer or Parkinsons’s disease. In silico
tools for calculating these deregulated pathways may help to gain
new insights into pathogenic mechanisms and may open novel av-
enues for therapy stratification in the sense of personalized medicine.
Here, we present NetworkTrail, a web service for the detection of
deregulated pathways and subgraphs in biological networks.
NetworkTrail uses a state-of—the—art integer linear programming-
based approach for this task and offers interfaces to the Biological
Network Analyzer (BiNA) and Cytoscape Web for visualizing the re-
sulting subnetworks. By providing an accessible interface to othenrvise
hard-to-use command line tools, the new web service enables non-
experts to quickly and reliably carry out this type of network analyses.
Availability and implementation: NetworkTrail is a JavaServer
Pages-based web service. The algorithm for finding deregulated sub-
networks has been implemented in C++. NetworkTrail is available at
http://networktrail.bioinf.uni-sb.de/.

1 INTRODUCTION

The deregulation of cell signaling pathways plays an important
role during tumor development. To identify such pathways a
number of approaches have been developed during the past
decade. The method of Ideker et al. (2002) for the detection of
active subgraphs is available as a Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003) plug-in. The BioNet software developed by Dittrich et al.
(2008) can be downloaded as an R package (http://www.r-pro-
ject.org). Vandin et al. (2011) have developed HotNet, which is
available as MATLAB source or through a web interface. The
algorithms developed by Dao et al. (2011) and Keller et al. (2009)
are provided as C++ source code. We have recently published
an efﬁcient approach based on integer linear programming (ILP)
(Backes et al., 2011), which is available as executable.

TThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two
authors should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Although a multitude of approaches for the analysis of expres-
sion data is exposed through web services (e. g. Martin-Requena
et al., 2010; Rainer et al., 2006), the tools for the search of
deregulated subnetworks aforementioned (except HotNet) have
to be downloaded and installed before usage. Furthermore, the
majority of the tools do neither provide a graphical user interface
nor an option to Visualize the resulting subgraphs directly.
Instead, most of the programs have to be executed from the
command line, and their outputs need to be processed using
third party packages. Thus, besides installing the required soft-
ware properly, users are required to possess intricate technical
knowledge of the complete tool chain. According to our experi-
ences, both tasks can be challenging for non-expert users. An
easy-to-use web interface hiding such technical details, and
thereby allowing the user to focus on the analysis, would over-
come these problems. Therefore, we have developed a web inter-
face called NetworkTrail that enables the user to detect
deregulated pathways and subgraphs in biological networks
using our recently published ILP-based approach (Backes
et al., 2011). Based on a score for each node that measures the
degree of deregulation of the corresponding gene or protein, the
heaviest connected subnetwork of a speciﬁed size k is computed.
Here, connectivity means that the subnetwork contains a desig-
nated root node from which all other nodes in the subnetwork
are reachable. This node can be interpreted as a potential mo-
lecular key player responsible for the observed deregulation. By
computing all such subnetworks in a speciﬁed size range, it is
possible to directly assess the stability of the computed result.

As input, the user can specify a Gene Expression Omnibus
(GEO) record. If the user desires to analyze raw expression
data, she/he currently is required to normalize the data and pro-
vide per- gene expression scores. After the computations are com-
pleted, the resulting subnetwork can then be Visualized using
Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010) or the Biological Network
Analyzer (BiNA, http://bina.sourceforge.net/).

database identiﬁers are supported. If not speciﬁed explicitly,
NetworkTrail attempts to infer the used identiﬁers. (1b)
Alternatively, either one GEO series (GSE) ﬁle or two GEO
dataset (GDS) ﬁles (one ﬁle represents the sample group to be
compared with the reference group contained in the second ﬁle)
can be uploaded. In case of GSE and GDS ﬁles, it is sufﬁcient to
enter valid GEO identiﬁers; the corresponding ﬁles are then
downloaded from GEO and stored on our server. As GSE ﬁles
usually contain samples from multiple groups, the user can freely
divide them into a sample and a reference set. (2) If no pre-
computed scores have been uploaded in the previous step, the
user can select among different scoring methods, such as
Student’s t-test, log-mean fold quotients or the Z—score, if one
group consists of only one sample. (3) NetworkTrail detects
the organism from which the scores were derived. The user is
given the option to correct this choice if necessary and can
choose a network for further analysis. Currently, regulatory net-
works for mouse, rat, human and Arabidopsis derived from the
KEGG regulatory pathways database (Kanehisa et al., 2010) are
supported. (4) As parameters, our ILP-based approach (Backes
et al., 2011) requires a range of subnetwork sizes that should be
analyzed. As the KEGG pathways contain nodes that corres-
pond to families or complexes of genes/proteins, multiple
scores need to be aggregated to obtain a single score for
these cases. As aggregation functions we offer min, max and
mean. (5) The user can choose to be notiﬁed Via email on com-
pletion of the analysis. (6) The results can then be Visualized
instantaneously from the web browser using either Cytoscape
Web (Lopes et al., 2010) or the Java Webstart—based BiNA.
Both tools present the union of all computed subgraphs in
a hierarchical layout. The user can individually highlight the
subnetwork for speciﬁc values of k. The degree of deregulation
is indicated by the node color, where white represents no
change and shades of red and green represent up- and down-
regulation, respectively. Moreover, BiNA allows for a complete
customization of the Visualization, including layout, colors and
node styles.

2.2 Implementation details

NetworkTrail’s server implementation is built on top of
J avaServer Pages. JavaScript and AJAX are used for client-
server communication, with a focus on responsive status and
error reporting. The interface has been tested on all major brow-
sers and operating systems. The mapping of scores to network
nodes and the ILP approach are implemented in C++ using the
CPLEX solver. The results of GEO queries are locally cached for
improved performance of repeated computations. No registra-
tion is required, and obtained results are stored for a 2 week
period. All computed data are provided for download in a
single archive containing the computed subnetworks, the scores
used for the computation and mappings of nodes to external
database identiﬁers in Cytoscape simple interaction format
(.sif) and/ or node attribute format (.na). For documentation pur-
poses, a ﬁle containing all used parameters is included.

3 CONCLUSION

In this article, we presented NetworkTrail, a web service for de-
tecting deregulated subnetworks in biological network data. The
availability of such a web service allows non-experts to carry out
network analyses without having to struggle with technical de-
tails, such as compiling/installing software or learning cryptic
commands. We are convinced that such easy-to-use web services
will help to elucidate pathogenic mechanisms, and that they may
also prove to be useful for therapy stratiﬁcation in cancer ther-
apy. In the future, NetworkTrail will be enhanced by including
further analysis methods and pre-deﬁned networks.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Many drug or single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-
related resources and tools have been developed, but connecting
and integrating them is still a challenge. Here, we describe a
user-friendly web-based software package, named Drug-SNPing,
which provides a platform for the integration of drug information
(DrugBank and PharmGKB), protein—protein interactions (STRING),
tagSNP selection (HapMap) and genotyping information (dbSNP,
REBASE and SNP500Cancer). DrugBank-based inputs include the
following: (i) common name of the drug, (ii) synonym or drug brand
name, (iii) gene name (HUGO) and (iv) keywords. PharmGKB-based
inputs include the following: (i) gene name (HUGO), (ii) drug name and
(iii) disease-related keywords. The output provides drug-related infor-
mation, metabolizing enzymes and drug targets, as well as protein—
protein interaction data. Importantly, tagSNPs of the selected genes
are retrieved for genotyping analyses. All drug-based and protein—pro-
tein interaction-based SNP genotyping information are provided with
PCR-RFLP (PCB-restriction enzyme length polymorphism) and
TaqMan probes. Thus, users can enter any drug keywords/brand
names to obtain immediate information that is highly relevant to gen-
otyping for pharmacogenomics research.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pharmacogenomics is a type of personalized medicine that stu-
dies drug therapy in terms of efﬁcacy or adverse events with
respect to each patient’s genetic variation such as single nucleo-
tide polymorphisms (SNPs) (Daly, 2010). SNP proﬁling in terms
of signiﬁcantly informative SNPs is an important factor when
carrying out drug selection, assessing dosages and deciding on a
therapeutic approach. Associating drug responses with a pa-
tient’s SNP genotype for genes related to the drug metabolism

and targeting is straight forward if the relevant pharmacogen-
omics information is readily available.

DrugBank (Knox et al., 2011; Wishart, 2008; Wishart et al.,
2008) and PharmGKB (Gong et al., 2008; Owen et al., 2008;
Sangkuhl et al., 2008; Thorn et al., 2010) are two notable data-
bases for pharmacogenomics-related information. Although
many SNP technologies associated with drug discovery have
been widely discussed (Beckstead et al., 2008; Chuang et al.,
2008; Shen et al., 2009; Voisey and Morris, 2008), experimental
information that allows widespread SNP genotyping is unavail-
able in DrugBank and PharmGKB.

Recently, many SNP-related tools, such as SNP500Cancer
(Packer et al., 2006), SNP-RFLPing (Chang et al., 2006, 2010),
Seq4SNPs (Field at al., 2009), SNP ID-info (Yang et al., 2008),
PineSAP ONegrzyn et al., 2009), Seq-SNPing (Chang et al.,
2009a), MapNext (Bao et al., 2009) and CandiSNPer (Schmitt
et al., 2010) have been developed. However, these lack the ability
to allow communication between SNP genotyping information
and drug targeting/metabolism/transporter/carrier. Moreover,
SNP—SNP and protein—protein interactions are not considered
in these SNP-related tools. In contrast, a powerful mining tool
for protein—protein interaction named STRING (Jensen et al.,
2009) has been developed, but no SNP-related information is
included. Therefore, it is still difﬁcult to integrate cheminfor-
matics with SNP interactivity and genotyping for pharmacogen-
omics purposes (Chang et al., 2012).

To overcome these problems, we developed an integrated
pharmacogenomics-based and protein interaction-based plat-
form for SNP genotyping information. TagSNPs retrieved
from HapMap (Deloukas and Bentley, 2004; Thorisson et al.,
2005), which can provide narrowed down informative SNP geno-
types, have been integrated in the proposed Drug-SNPing
system. This study presents a novel and user-friendly web-based
pharmacogenomics tool that allows the study of drug-related
SNP interactions and related genotyping.

Fig. 1. System structure and ﬂow chart for Drug-SNPing
interaction module; and (vi) SNP retrieval module. These modules are 

described in detail below.

(i) The input module accepts drug-related terms, including common
name, synonym or brand name, gene name and other keywords based on
DrugBank, as well as gene name, drug name and disease based on
PharmGKB as shown in Figure 2. (ii) The drug info query module pro-
vides drug-related information (drug-orientated and gene-centric inputs)
from DrugBank (W ishart, 2008; Wishart et al., 2008), especially in terms
of drug targets, metabolizing enzymes, transporters and carriers. (iii) In
the tagSNPs analysis module, a user-selected gene is entered to retrieve
the appropriate tagSNPs from HapMap (Thorisson et al., 2005). The
retrieval tagSNPs are fed into the SNP-RFLP analysis module for further
analysis. (iv) In the SNP-RFLP analysis module, SNP distinguished in-
formation from dbSNP in NCBI (Sherry et al., 2001), TaqMan probes
from SNP500Cancer (Packer et al., 2006) and from dbSNP in NCBI
(ABI), if available, together with PCR-RFLP primers from
Prim-SNPing (Chang et al., 2009b), and restriction enzyme information
from REBASE (Roberts et al., 2010) are integrated. (v) The STRING
interaction module provides visualization of the protein interaction map
retrieved online from STRING (Jensen et al., 2009) for the selected genes.
The information from NCBI dbSNPs (Sherry et al., 2001) and/or
HapMap tagSNPs is available as part of the STRING map reconstructed
in our system. (vi) The SNP retrieval module provides the SNP informa-
tion. This information is integrated into the SNP-RFLP analysis module.

2.2 Database description

Some data have been previously downloaded from other databases, and
some data are retrieved online. For example, DrugBank (Knox et al.,
2011; Wishart, 2008; Wishart et al., 2008) (http://www.drugbank.ca/
downloads) and PharmGKB (Gong et al., 2008; Owen et al., 2008;
Sangkuhl et al., 2008; Thorn et al., 2010) (http://www.pharmgkb.org/)
for input and its drug info modules, REBASE (Roberts et al., 2010)
(http://rebase.neb.com/rebase/rebasehtml) for restriction enzyme
mining to be used in RFLP analysis and SNP500Cancer (Packer et al.,
2006) (http://variantgps.nci.nih.gov/cgfseq/pages/snp500.do) for the
TaqMan probe information are downloaded and have been built into
local databases. Some bulky databases, such as HapMap (Thorisson
et al., 2005) for tagSNPs information, dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001) in
NCBI for information on basic SNP functions and TaqMan probes
and STRING (http://string.embl.de/) (Jensen et al., 2009) for protein

component, was used to demonstrate the function of the Drug-SNPing in
the result section.

3 RESULTS

As shown in Figure 2, input items such as common name, syno-
nym or brand name, gene name (HUGO ofﬁcial gene symbol)
and other keywords are line fed through the web interface for
analysis in terms of drug-based SNP genotyping information.
The outputs for the query results in the pipeline and for the
SNP genotyping information from Drug-SNPing are shown in
Figures 3 and 4, respectively.

3.1 Query results in the Drug-SNPing pipeline

For the example of AHF (synonym or brand name) as an input,
the query drug information is provided in Figure 3; it includes
DrugBank ID with hyperlink (Fig. 3A-a1), common name,
chemical formula, molecular weight, drug description and
DrugBank information (drug targets, metabolizing enzymes,
transporters and carriers). The DrugBank information (Fig.
3A-a2) provides a hyperlink that allows the presentation of the
information on: (b1) drug targets (Coagulation factor X,
Coagulation factor IX, von Willebrand factor, Phytanoyl-CoA
dioxygenase peroxisomal, Asialoglycoprotein receptor 2, 78 kDa
glucose-regulated protein and others), (b2) metabolizing enzymes
(Prothrombin and Vitamin K-dependent protein C), (b3) drug
transporters (not available) and (b4) drug carriers (not available)
for the input (e. g. AHF) as shown in Figures 3B-b1, -b2, -b3 and
-b4, respectively. Subsequently, a candidate of interest (e.g.
Coagulation factor X) can be selected by clicking (as indicated
by the arrow in Fig. 3B). Other examples, such as HUGO gene
name input, are shown in the user manual.

During the pre-stage of tagSNP retrieval, some parameters in
HapMap, such as HapMap database version, population, pair-
wise methods, R Square cut-off and minimal allele frequency
(MAF) cut-off (Fig. 3C-cl), are adjustable before clicking an
‘preferred name’ (e.g. F10 as shown in Fig. 3C-c2).

At the retrieval stage for protein interaction and tagSNP in-
formation, the interactive proteins and their tagSNPs, which are
listed on the left side and center of Figure 3D, are retrieved
online from STRING (Jensen et al., 2009) and HapMap
(Thorisson et al., 2005), respectively. All these gene names and
tagSNPs can be hyperlinked to Entrez Gene and dbSNP in
NCBI, respectively. The PharmGKB info button provides a
hyperlink to access all kinds of pharmacogenomics-related infor-
mation stored in PharmGKB. The genotype information for
tagSNP (obtained via SNP-RFLP button) is provided as
described later in Figure 4. The “STRING interaction’ box at
the bottom of Figure 3D (as indicated by the arrow) provides
further STRING interactions.

As shown in Figure 3E, proteins that interact to a greater
or lesser extent in relation to the selected genes associated with
the drug metabolism can be retrieved online from STRING
(Jensen et al., 2009). Moreover, STRING-based visualization
(Fig. 3E-e3) is implemented with a hyperlink to our developed
SNP genotyping information system (as described later in Fig. 4)
rather than the original STRING function for protein annota-
tion. This SNP genotype information is based on the settings for

NCBI SNPs and HapMap tagSNPs (Fig. 3E-e1 and -e2, respect-
ively). Many SNP sub-functions in dbSNP of NCBI are analysed
in Drug-SNPing, e.g. functional class, SNP class, heterozygosity
and TaqMan resources [SNP500Cancer (Packer et al., 2006) and
ABI in NCBI dbSNP] for SNP genotyping information.

3.2 Outputs of SNP genotyping information

In the example, rs2740171 (Fig. 4A) was selected to show the
SNP genotyping information for the SNP fasta sequence (as
shown in Fig. 4A-a1) and for the TaqMan probe from dbSNP
in NCBI (Applied Biosystems; ABI) (Fig. 4A-a2). A hyperlink is
available to enter the TaqMan probe for ABI as shown
in Figure 4A-a2. Natural primers and RFLP restriction en-
zymes for traditional PCR-RFLP analysis are provided in
Figures 4A-a3 and -a4, respectively. In Figure 4A-a3, the loca-
tions of the natural primers are visualized in the SNP-containing
sequences. In Figure 4A-a4, information in relation to RFLP
restriction enzymes for both the sense and antisense strands are
available via REBASE (Roberts et al., 2010).

In another example, rs1051740 (Fig. 4B) was selected to show
the SNP genotyping information for mismatch (mutagenic)
PCR—RFLP. The TaqMan probe information, including se-
quences for the paired TaqMan probe and the forward/reverse
primers, was retrieved online from SNP500Cancer (Packer et al.,
2006) (Fig. 4B-b1). The enzyme information for PCR-RFLP
using mutagenic primers is also available (Fig. 4A-b2).

For both natural and mutagenic primers (Fig. 4A-a3 and -b2),
much SNP genotyping information, such as primer sequences,
positions, primer lengths, GC%, Tm values, Tm value differ-
ences and product lengths after PCR-RFLP analyses, are also
available from Drug-SNPing.

3.3 Example scenarios

Seventeen example scenarios with animations were provided
online (http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/drug—snping/user_manua1.jsp),
including: (i) The query results for drug information; (ii) The
query results for the drug targets, metabolizing enzymes, drug
transporters and drug carriers; (iii) The query results for the
interactive genes; (iv) The query results for STRING interaction;
(v) The query results for STRING interaction with more inter-
actions; (vi) The query results for STRING interaction with
less interactions; (vii) NCBI SNP selection for SNP
genotyping information; (viii) HapMap tagSNPs for SNP geno-
typing information; (ix) Example of result for SNP fasta
information; (x) Example of result for TaqMan probe informa-
tion; (xi) Example of result for Natural primer information;
(xii) Example of result for Enzyme Information; (xiii) Example
of result for Mutagenic primer information; (xiv) TagSNPs gen-
otyping information; (xv) One tagSNP genotyping information;
(xvi) PharmGKB information; and (xvii) PharmGKB STRING
interaction.

Fig. 4. Representative outputs for SNP genotyping information in Drug-SNPing. (A) Natural primers for rs2740171. (B) Mutagenic primers for
rs1051740. SNP genotyping information such as (a1): SNP fasta sequence, (a2/b1): TaqMan probe from SNP500Cancer/NCBI, (a3/b2): natural/mu-
tagenic RFLP primers and (a4/b2): restriction enzymes for natural/mutagenic RFLP primers are shown

(Royo and Galan, 2009) and TaqMan (Shen et al., 2009).
However, the materials for SNP array analysis and the machine
for pyrosequencing are more expensive than the TaqMan
method. Therefore, we selected the TaqMan probe information
for implementation in the Drug-SNPing. Currently, two major
resources for SNP-related TaqMan probe information are avail-
able, namely SNP500Cancer and dbSNP in NCBI (ABI), but
neither can provide TaqMan probe information for all SNPs.
Furthermore, TaqMan probes are sometimes unsuitable for gen-
otyping of some SNPs (Demirci et al., 2007; Kocsis et al., 2008;
Yoshiya et al., 2008). To compensate for such problems, we also
implemented a RFLP genotyping module in Drug-SNPing.
When implementing RFLP genotyping, some SNPs do not
have natural primers (regular PCR-RFLP primers). As an alter-
native, we introduced mutagenic primers whereby the module

computationally introduces mismatched nucleotides into the for-
ward (F) primer sequence to artiﬁcially generate a new restriction
enzyme site for SNP genotyping. The lack of natural primers can
be overcome by the use of mutagenic primers, as can be seen for
rs1051740 in Figure 4B. Other examples are presented in the user
manual.

Although DrugBank (\Nishart et al., 2008) contains a versatile
search function for many inputs, its gene name input for ‘drug
target’ is limited to the full name rather than the HUGO ofﬁcial
gene symbol. For example, FABP7 (fatty acid-binding protein,
brain), PADI4 (protein-arginine deiminase type 4) and PTGS2
(prostaglandin G/H synthase 2) are listed in the ‘drug cards’
of DB00132, DB00155 and DB00154 in DrugBank, respectively.
But for gene name (HUGO) inputs, such as FABP7, PADI4
and PTGS2, the appropriate drug records related to

these genes can not be found, e.g. http://www.drugbank.
ca/search/search?query=FABP7, http: / /www.drugbank.ca / sea
rch/search?query=PADI4 and http://www.drugbank.ca/search/
search?query=PTGS2. In contrast, Drug-SNPing allows input
based on the HUGO gene name, which improves the
gene-centric search for drugs with input drug targets. This is
demonstrated in the user manual for Drug-SNPing. In
Drug-SNPing, we also integrated PharmGKB (Gong et al.,
2008; Owen et al., 2008; Sangkuhl et al., 2008; Thorn et al.,
2010) for annotation of important genes related to drug
responses and pathways as a complement to DrugBank. The
contributions in Drug-SNPing, PharmGKB and DrugBank are
shown in Table 1.

The importance of SNP—SNP interactions in association stu-
dies is increasing, but most studies only focus their data analysis
on limited and known SNPs (Lin et al., 2008, 2009; Yang et al.,
2009, 2012; Yen et al., 2008; Zheng et al., 2008). To ﬁll this gap,
we incorporated a widely used protein—protein interaction tool,
STRING (Jensen et al., 2009), in Drug-SNPing. We perform
SNP—SNP interaction analysis based on the protein—protein
interaction data from STRING via online retrieval. In the cur-
rent version of Drug-SNPing, however, many other protein—pro-
tein interaction tools are not yet included, such as GWIDD
(Kundrotas et al., 2010) for genome-wide protein docking data-
base, STITCH 2 (Kuhn et al., 2010) for an interaction network
database for small molecules and proteins, Gene Interaction
Miner (Ikin et al., 2010) for data mining contextual information
for protein—protein interaction analysis, Path (Zamar et al.,
2009) to facilitate pathway-based genetic association analysis
and Polymorphism Interaction Analysis (PIA) (Mechanic
et al., 2008) as a method for investigating complex gene—gene
interactions, and protein—protein interaction databases (Lehne
and Schlitt, 2009). Similarly, more drug-related chemoinfor-
matics resources are also not yet included in the current version
of Drug-SNPing, such as DCDB (Liu et al., 2010) as a drug
combination database, drug-binding databases (Timmers et al.,
2008), SuperSite (Andre Bauer et al., 2008) as a dictionary of
metabolite and drug-binding sites in proteins and the drug
adverse reaction target database (DART) (Ji et al., 2003) for
proteins related to adverse drug reactions. In future, we intend

to integrate the available ftp data released in these tools in order
to add more value to the Drug-SNPing product.

The performance of the Drug-SNPing was assessed by at least
50 different inputs (see the section of ‘Assessment of Drug-
SNPing’ at http://bio.kuas.edu.tw/drug-snping/user_manua1.
jsp), and all of them were functional to get the output by
Drug-SNPing. Moreover, the operating time for integration in
Drug-SNPing can save time compared with non-integration.

5 CONCLUSION

In this article, we developed a novel integrated web-based inter-
face, Drug-SNPing, that provides user-friendly connections be-
tween the tools DrugBank for chemoinformatics, pharmGKB
for pharmcogenomics, STRING for protein—protein interaction,
genotyping information for TaqMan probes and PCR-RFLP.
Moreover, gene-centric inputs can also be used as a means of
ﬁnding corresponding drugs for drug targeting and metabolism.
This tool thus provides all the drug-orientated and gene-centric
inputs which are needed to mine all possible metabolic enzymes
and targets for these drugs, as well as bench mark information
that allows SNP genotyping to be performed. This platform will
be helpful for the development of pharmacogenomics as part of
personalized medicine.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC/MS) is
a key technique in metabolomics. Since the efficient assignment
of MS signals to true biological metabolites becomes feasible in
combination with in vivo stable isotopic labelling, our aim was to
provide a new software tool for this purpose.

Results: An algorithm and a program (MetExtract) have been
developed to search for metabolites in in vivo labelled biological
samples. The algorithm makes use of the chromatographic
characteristics of the LC/MS data and detects MS peaks fulfilling
the criteria of stable isotopic labelling. As a result of all calculations,
the algorithm specifies a list of m/z values, the corresponding number
of atoms of the labelling element (e.g. carbon) together with retention
time and extracted adduct-, fragment- and polymer ions. Its function
was evaluated using native 120- and uniformly 13C-labelled standard
substances.

Availability: MetExtract is available free of charge and warranty at

available for Windows operating systems.

1 INTRODUCTION

The extraction of high-resolution LC/MS signals of true metabolites
contained in complex biological samples is still a major challenge in
non-targeted metabolomics. This limitation can largely be attributed
to the non— speciﬁc nature of the electrospray ionisation (ESI) process
in LC/MS, leading to full scan spectra, which tend to contain up
to > 90% background signals compared with signals measured for
metabolites (Keller et al., 2008). In vivo stable isotopic labelling
offers a powerful tool to circumvent these limitations. Uniformly
13 C-labelled metabolites show identical chromatographic behaviour
as their non-labelled isotopologues but can be easily differentiated
by MS. Recently, (Giavalisco et al., 2009) for example, successfully
used 13C-labelled Arabidopsis thaliana plants in combination with

database searching for the elimination of background signals and
annotation of metabolites. Despite the high potential of this approach
in metabolomics research, no algorithms have been published for
the automated evaluation of LC/MS data originating from in vivo
labelled biological samples. To the best of our knowledge, a
single commercial software programme exists to date, which has
been designed to assign differentially expressed metabolites in
differently treated biological samples (e. g. control versus treatment)
by calculating and graphically illustrating the intensity ratios of the
principal ions from isotopologue signal pairs (Jong and Beecher,
2011; http://nextgenmetabolomics.coml). Complementary to this,
the presented MetExtract algorithm makes use of biological cultures
obtained under identical growth conditions with the only difference
being the isotopic composition of the nutrition source. MetExtract
mainly aims at the global detection and combination of metabolite-
derived corresponding LC/MS signals originating from natural and
stable isotopically labelled analogues and their assignment to true
biological metabolites.

1.1 Scope of the MetExtract algorithm

The presented algorithm was designed to extract as many metabolite-
derived MS signals as possible from LC high-resolution full scan
data with the aim to obtain a global picture of the metabolome
of the respective organism. It requires that the studied organism
is cultivated in parallel on two nutrition media, which only differ
in the isotopic composition of a speciﬁed element X (e. g. carbon),
either almost solely in form of stable ‘isotope A’ (e. g. 120 in natural
glucose) or ‘isotope B’ (e.g. 13C in labelled 1306 glucose). The
developed algorithm makes use of the following characteristics,
typically observed in mass spectra of a 1+1 mixture of non-labelled
as well as fully labelled biological samples: (i) the monoisotopic
non-labelled and the completely labelled isotopologues should
form the principal ions of their corresponding isotopic patterns
and (ii) these two patterns have to be separated by at least one
atomic mass unit. For example, if carbon is used as the labelling
element and the ﬁrst nutrition medium contains carbon at its natural
isotopic composition (98.93% 120 and 1.07% 13C), the second
medium should contain the same carbon source(s) as medium 1
but each of the C-sources with a high 13C/ 120 ratio. Assuming
for example, a ﬁnal 13C/ 120 ratio of 0.985 for the metabolites of
the ‘13C-culture sample’, all metabolite ions containing between

2 and 65 C-atoms fulﬁl the above-mentioned criteria and can be
detected by MetExtract. Moreover, since the resulting ESI-LC/MS
metabolite mass spectra contain two distinct isotopic patterns,
the mass difference of the corresponding principal ions will be
proportional to the number of atoms of the labelling element.
MetExtract can also be used to investigate the metabolization of
uniformly labelled tracer substrates as long as the MS signals of
the resulting tracer derivatives fulﬁl the above-mentioned criteria. It
shall be noted, however, that the algorithm has not been speciﬁcally
designed to work with nutrition sources of partially labelled or
mixtures of labelled and non-labelled precursors. Partly labelled
metabolite pools, originating from the metabolization/ incorporation
of non— or partly labelled substrates can only be detected by the
algorithm if the formed (and partially labelled) derivatives lead to
mass spectra with an isotopic pattern containing a clearly assignable
principal ion and corresponding isotopic peaks, which can be linked
to the corresponding non-labelled isotopologue.

2 DESCRIPTION OF THE ALGORITHM FOR
METABOLITE EXTRACTION

MetExtract uses a brute force approach for MS signal extraction
and was implemented in C++ using the Qt SDK (V. 4.7.2, http://
qt.nokia.com/productsl). The programme is capable of processing
high-resolution MS full scan data, independent of the MS instrument
type or manufacturer. It comprises several distinct operation steps,
which will be described in the following.

In a ﬁrst step, full proﬁle, full scan raw LC/MS data ﬁles
have to be centroided and converted to the common data format
‘mzxml’ (Pedrioli et al., 2004).

M/z value picking: detection of MS signals originating from
isotopically labelled metabolites is done by iterating over all MS
signal data in each mass spectrum. Since the different native (non-
labelled) 120- and uniformly 13C-labelled isotopologues are not
separated by LC, each mass spectrum of a metabolite contains mass
peaks of both isotopic forms. Each MS signal above a selected
intensity threshold in the investigated mass spectra is initially
considered to be the monoisotopic peak of a non-labelled metabolite
ion containing only the lighter isotope of the labelling element X.
Since the number of atoms of element X per metabolite ion cannot
directly be determined from the selected m/z value, the algorithm
uses a deﬁned range of atom numbers to ﬁnd the corresponding
peak of the fully labelled isotopologue by testing for postulated
theoretical masses of the fully labelled isotopologues. If a mass
peak with a postulated m/z value has been found in the same mass
spectrum, the presence of isotopic peaks is veriﬁed by the algorithm.
Only if a pre—deﬁned number of isotopic peaks are observed for
both non— and fully labelled isotopologues and if their intensity
ratios compared with the monoisotopic or fully labelled mass peaks
are within a pre-deﬁned intensity range window, the signal for
which the search was started is considered a MS peak of a putative
metabolite. The m/z value picking is ﬁnalized by calculating the
Pearson’s Correlation Coefﬁcient (corr) for the extracted ion current
chromatograms of both the non-labelled and fully labelled isotopic
molecules (Dalgaard, 2008). Only, if the signals of the isotopic
ions are found and corr is at least the pre-set threshold value, the
investigated mass peak is added to the list of picked m/z values.
Otherwise, the assumption of the processed mass peak being caused

by a true metabolite is discarded. Subsequently, the next mass peak
in the mass spectrum is tested by the same procedure until all signals
of all spectra have been evaluated. The result of this step is a list
of m/z values representing the native isotopic form together with
the corresponding numbers of atoms of element X contained in the
respective metabolite ion.

Binning of m/z values: the next step is to group the picked
MS signals to bins according to the similarity of m/z values and
retention times. This is done by performing several hierarchical
clustering algorithms (Hastie et al., 2009, pp. 520—528) using
Euclidean distance and average linking. Each hierarchical clustering
is performed only with mass peaks with the same number of X atoms.
This step successfully groups potential metabolite ions with the same
m/z values into bins, but it does not consider structural isomers. As
a consequence, putative metabolites having the same sum formula
but different molecular structures are located in the same bin even
if they were separated during the LC step of the analysis.

Separating of m/z value bins according to expected chromato-
graphic peak width: since the extracted metabolites can be
expected to elute into the MS detector in form of chromatographic
peaks with typical peak widths in the order of seconds, the minimum
and maximum number of scans contained in an m/z value bin can
be selected with the program. If, for the selected m/z bin no signal
was recorded for a pre-deﬁned time interval, the algorithm splits the
inspected bin in to two parts: one representing the detected mass
peaks before the chromatographic gap and one with MS signals of
this particular m/z value after the gap.

Combining of m/z value bins and database searching:
subsequently, the algorithm searches for bins with m/z values
of pre-deﬁned adduct-, fragment— and polymer ions using an m/z
value offset list. If two bins have a speciﬁed m/z offset value as well
as the same number of X atoms and are eluted within a speciﬁed
time window, the algorithm can combine the related adduct ions
to a single group and calculate the accurate mass of the putative
metabolite which can be used to perform an automated database
search on the extracted metabolites using in-house or commercial
databases such as e.g. Antibase (Laatsch, 2007).

Results of the algorithm: for a given LC/MS dataset observed for
stable isotopic labelled metabolites, MetExtract offers a list of m/z
values which were identiﬁed to represent true biological metabolites.
The ﬁnal output speciﬁes binned m/z values, the corresponding
number of atoms of the speciﬁed labelling element (e.g. carbon)
together with retention time and found adduct-, fragment-and
polymer ions. If database search function is used, database entries
matching the selected assignment criteria will also be listed.

3 VERIFICATION OF THE ALGORITHM

The 15 native 120- and uniformly 13C-labelled fungal standard
substances were spiked to a non-labelled Fusarium graminearum
culture sample. The mixture was measured by high-resolution
LC/MS using positive ionization for veriﬁcation. Under the
described measurement conditions and parameter settings, 55
LC/MS signals from all 15 metabolites were extracted by
the developed MetExtract algorithm (Table 1, Supplementary

Materials). For each standard substance, the correct number of
C-atoms was assigned. No false positives were detected by the
algorithm. Further, the algorithm detected two ions within our
standards that showed characteristic pairs of isotopic patterns
but could not be assigned to one of the spiked standard
substances. We concluded that these ions originate from impurities
in the used standard solutions, which partly originated directly
from a production stock solution. For experimental details and
MetExtract parameter settings, please refer to the Supplementary

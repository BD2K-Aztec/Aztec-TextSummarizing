Abstract

Summary: Specific recognition of DNA by proteins is a crucial step of many biological processes.
PDlviz is a plugin for the PyMOL molecular visualization system that analyzes protein—DNA binding
interfaces by comparing the solvent accessible surface area of the complex against the free protein
and free DNA. The plugin provides three distinct three—dimensional visualization modes to high—
light interactions with DNA bases and backbone, major and minor groove, and with atoms of differ—
ent pharmacophoric type (hydrogen bond donors/acceptors, hydrophobic and thymine methyl).
Each mode comes in three styles to focus the visual analysis on the protein or DNA side of the
interface, or on the nucleotide sequence. PDlviz allows for the generation of publication quality
images, all calculated data can be written to disk, and a command line interface is provided for
automating tasks. The plugin may be helpful for the detailed identification of regions involved in
DNA base and shape readout, and can be particularly useful in rapidly pinpointing the overall
mode of interaction.

Availability and implementation: Freely available at http://melolab.org/pdiviz/ as a PyMOL plugin.
Tested with incentive, educational, and open source versions of PyMOL on Windows, Mac and
Linux systems.

1 Introduction

Specific recognition of DNA by proteins is a prerequisite of many
biological processes and is essentially understood when analyzed at
a three—dimensional (3D) structural level. The steadily increasing
number of protein—nucleic acid complexes deposited in the Protein
Data Bank (>4500 by end of 2014; Berman et 61]., 2000) now allows
for a more fine—grained structural analysis of the key determinants
of protein—DNA interactions. These interactions may be broadly
classified into base readout (sequence—dependent interactions with
DNA bases via the major or minor groove) and shape readout (de—
tection of global or local variation of the canonical DNA shape;
Rohs et 61]., 2010). However, protein—DNA interactions are complex
and a simple recognition code does likely not exist (Slattery et 61].,

2014). 3D visual analysis of protein—DNA complexes today often
requires the use of several computer programs for contact analysis
and visualization. Here we present PDIviz, a plugin for the PyMOL
molecular visualization system (Schrodinger, LLC) that is specific—
ally designed to visualize protein—DNA interfaces and to focus visual
analysis on various aspects of protein—DNA interactions.

2 Implementation

Protein—DNA interface detection is based on the method of differen—
tial solvent accessible surface area estimation. The plugin estimates
the solvent accessible surface area (SASA) with the PyMOL com—
mand get_area (solvent radius: 1.4 A), which employs the

Shrake—Rupley algorithm (Shrake and Rupley, 1973). We compared
the results against NACCESS, a reference software for SASA calcu—
lation (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993). To obtain surface areas com—
parable to NACCESS, the default van der Waals (vdW) radii in
PyMOL were redefined according to the values published by
Chothia (1975). We benchmarked PDIviz against NACCESS version
2.1.1 with a non—redundant set of 245 protein—DNA complexes
derived from our Protein—DNA Interface Database (PDIdb;
Norambuena and Melo, 2010) and obtained a low root mean
squared difference of 0.078 A2 per atom for SASA estimation (for
details see Supplementary Material).

The basic approach of PDIviz is the calculation of various types
of buried surface areas of the protein—DNA interface. First, a
protein—DNA complex is loaded into PyMOL and the plugin calcu—
lates SASA of the complex, the free protein and the free DNA. To
calculate the latter two surfaces the protein and DNA are each cop—
ied to a new molecular object (isolated), prior to SASA estimation.
Second, the difference in SASA of the isolated protein and isolated
DNA against the complex is calculated for each atom 1' according to
Equation 1:

ASASA, = SASAfsolated — SASAfomplex (1)

where ASASA is the buried surface area (BSA). PDIviz identifies sur-
face areas interacting with different regions of DNA, namely DNA
bases, the sugar—phosphate backbone, and the major and minor
groove. The definition of major/minor groove atoms in duplex
B—DNA is according to Seeman et al. (1976). To estimate BSA, the
different DNA regions are first isolated. Next, BSA of protein atoms
interacting with DNA bases is calculated as SASA(protein) —
SASA(bases —1— protein); BSA of protein atoms interacting with DNA

 

backbone is calculated as SASA(protein) — SASA(DNA back-
bone—l—protein); BSA of protein atoms interacting with the major
groove of DNA is calculated as SASA(complex — major groove) —
SASA(complex); and BSA of protein atoms interacting with the
minor groove is calculated as SASA(complex — minor groove) —
SASA(complex).

PDIviz is easily installed via PyMOL’s Plugin Manager and started
from the Plugin menu. The PDIviz plugin presents itself as a separate
window with three different tabs (Fig 1): ‘Main’, containing the main
controls for calculation and visualization; ‘Statistics’, containing a
table listing calculated buried and accessible surface areas in A2; and
‘About’, which contains a brief description of the plugin. Any
protein—DNA complex loaded in PyMOL is automatically recognized
by PDIviz and may be selected from the drop down box in the ‘Main’
tab. Calculations are executed by selecting any of the nine visualiza-
tion modes. The BSA cutoff value may be configured by the user (de—
fault: >0.0 A2), where higher values result in a smaller detected
interface area. The PyMOL visualization window background color,
and the protein and DNA surface transparency can also be modified
to specific user needs. PDIviz provides three principal visualization
modes, which highlight (i) interactions with DNA bases and the sugar—
phosphate backbone (buttons of the 1st column), (ii) interactions with
the major and minor groove (2nd column) and (iii) interactions with
atoms of different pharmacophoric type (3rd column). In general, all
atoms and surface areas involved in the protein—DNA interface are
colored, while the remaining atoms and areas are shown in white.
Color intensity (a color gradient blending into white) correlates with
BSA. In the first mode, the sugar—phosphate backbone interface (DNA
backbone atoms and protein atoms interacting with them) is colored
in red, the DNA bases interface is colored in blue, and atoms/areas
involved in simultaneous interaction with DNA bases and backbone

are colored in yellow. In the second mode, the major groove interface
is shown in blue, the minor groove interface is colored in green and
simultaneous interaction with both grooves is shown in violet (possible
in rare cases, e.g. damaged DNA). In the last mode (pharmacophore
mode), hydrogen bond (H—bond) donors are shown in blue, H—bond
acceptors are shown in red, donor/acceptor atoms (e.g. hydroxyl
group) are colored in pink, thymine methyl groups are shown in yel-
low and other interface atoms are colored white. Here, all remaining
non—interface atoms are colored in gray, according to the color scheme
published by Rohs et al. (2010). Each visualization mode additionally
comes in three different styles. Buttons of the first row show the DNA
in surface mode and the protein in balls—and—sticks mode, thus focus—
ing on the protein side of the interface. All atoms involved in inter—
actions are shown as balls, while other atoms of interface residues are
shown as sticks. Buttons of the second row focus on the DNA side:
they show the protein in surface mode and the DNA as balls and
sticks. The last row of buttons is a variation of the previous mode
(protein as surface, DNA as balls and sticks). However, this mode
focuses on the nucleotide sequence. If a nucleotide contains at least
one atom participating in the protein—DNA interface, the entire nu-
cleotide is colored according to the color scheme defined above. Since
entire nucleotides are colored, continuous sequence stretches involved
in certain types of interactions are easily identified in 3D and also at
the sequence level with help of PyMOL’s sequence browser.

Finally, publication quality images may be saved via the ‘Save
Image’ button and detailed tabular SASA and BSA data may be
saved as text files with help of the ‘Save Data’ button. Advanced
user may find the command line interface useful to run PDIviz in
batch mode. A manual with a full description of these features is
available with the software release from our website at http://melo
lab.org/pdiviz/.

In conclusion, PDIviz is a novel plugin for PyMOL that
provides an intuitive way of visualizing protein—DNA binding inter-
faces detected by solvent accessible surface area estimation. Nine visu—
alization modes are available, which help focusing on various aspects
of protein—DNA interactions such as specific versus unspecific binding
and base versus shape readout. Additionally, PDIviz may be useful in
rapidly pinpointing the overall mode of interaction.

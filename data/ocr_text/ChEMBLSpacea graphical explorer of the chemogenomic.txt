ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ChEMBLSpace graphical explorer enables the iden-
tification of compounds from the ChEMBL database, which exhibit
a desirable polypharmacology profile. This profile can be predefined
or created iteratively, and the tool can be extended to other data
sources.

1 INTRODUCTION

There is much recent interest in designing ligands with
well-deﬁned polypharmacology, arising both from the increased
awareness of the multiple interactions of existing drugs, and the
likely improved efﬁcacy of treatments, which engage at several
points in biological networks. (Dudley et al., 2010). It is straight-
forward to search public or proprietary data sources for com-
pounds, which are known to hit predeﬁned sets of targets to
provide starting points for a multi-target discovery project.
Meanwhile, visualization approaches have been developed that
analyse a biologically motivated protein network for molecules
that show interactions with more than one component. (Paolini
et al., 2006). This allows the opportunistic identiﬁcation of pre-
viously unconsidered target combinations. There are several
powerful network visualization and analysis tools available for
this purpose, including several free/open-source applications [e. g.
Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011)]. However, these tools are de-
signed to support arbitrary network types; thus, it is not directly
possible to analyse a chemogenomic network in combination
with molecular structures and activity proﬁles. This integration
of visual network exploration and activity proﬁle lookup can be
achieved by ChEMBLSpace. The user interface is designed for
the visual exploration of a chemogenomic space in which the
network vertices correspond to proteins that have at least one
ligand in common with other targets. The user can interactively
select proteins and list their ligands, subsequently designing an
activity proﬁle by adding more targets or anti-targets to the

selection and adjusting protein-speciﬁc activity thresholds.
Furthermore, the user does not have to know the proﬁle in ad-
vance but can create it interactively, considering the matching
ligands, as well as other associated proteins that might not have
been clear choices initially. The molecules that meet the created
activity proﬁle are displayed within the application, and the full
collection can be saved as an SD ﬁle.

2 METHODS

The ChEMBLSpace explorer itself is a database-independent graphical
user interface and consequently requires some preprocessing of the ori-
ginal data. We provide all scripts and tools required to create the under-
lying data collection as open source, but the GUI will also work if the
data are compiled using different methods that follow the approaches
presented in this section.

Initially, the basic information is extracted from ChEMBLl4 (Gaulton
et al., 2012) and processed into a new database. For each human protein
target in ChEMBL, the list of drug-like compounds that have activity
data for the target (subject to additional requirements, such as exact
activity reported in nM; standard activity type reported as either ECSO,
ICSO or K), were extracted. In case of multiple assay measurements per
compound and target, only the most active was selected. Subsequently,
this resulted in a subset of 81986 distinct molecule—protein associations
(the full list can be obtained from the supporting material).

This subset, which was compiled using the workﬂow environment
KNIME (Berthold et al., 2007), was then used to create a new database,
consisting of three basic tables: A target table, which contained the
non-redundant list of proteins with unique identiﬁers; a compound
table, with unique molecule IDs and canonical SMILES; and an activity
table with the numeric activity value (in log units) between a compound
ID and a target ID. Columns with target description and measurement
method information were also stored. These three tables served as input
for a Python script that subsequently generated a fourth table. The latter
resembles an adjacency list for the network. For each molecule with re-
ported activities for more than one target, a row was inserted into the
table, thus mapping a compound ID to a pair of targets, along with its
respective activities.

In the ﬁnal step, the resulting database was used to create a collection
of ﬂat ﬁles that contain all necessary information and can be deployed
alongside the ChEMBLSpace explorer, thus rendering the application
database independent. In more detail, the network was created as
graph object in which a vertex corresponds to a target, and two vertices
are connected if the respective targets have at least one ligand in common.
The resulting network was stored in the GraphML format. Additionally,
for each target, a text ﬁle was created containing an activity-sorted list of
compounds, including IDs, SMILES and full activity proﬁles. The cre-
ated collection of text ﬁles is all that is required for the visualization and

exploration of the chemogenomic space covered by the underlying
database using the presented ChEMBLSpace explorer.

The ChEMBLSpace explorer is a Java application that visualizes and
analyses a chemogenomic network (Fig. l). The visualization is based on
the Prefuse (Heer et al., 2005) library. All network visualization compo-
nents are using the Prefuse API (including layout, colouring, search panel
and user interaction). The chemistry engine, which is only required for the
molecules rendering and for the SD ﬁle export, is provided by the
Chemistry Development Kit [(Steinbeck et al., 2003, 2006), version
1.4.8]. The network data are provided as a collection of ﬂat ﬁles in the
data folder. This folder contains an XML ﬁle describing the network
topology in the GraphML format and a tab-separated ﬁle for each pro-
tein containing the molecules that have activity data for the respective
protein. The program itself can be run as a stand-alone Java application
using the executable jar ﬁle or can be used as an applet in a browser by
opening the provided HTML ﬁle or placing it on a local web server.

3 APPLICATION AND CONCLUSION

When ChEMBLSpace is started, it loads the polypharmacology
network from the GraphML ﬁle and generates a layout using the
Graph API provided by Prefuse. The network is displayed using
a radial layout by default. The user can change the layout by
selecting one of the methods in the “Network Layout’ menu (the
“Force-directed Layout’ continues the energy minimization as
long as the mouse is pressed).

The chemogenomic space is visualized as a network of proteins
in which two vertices are connected if they share at least one
compound that has an activity measured for both of them.
The edges are coloured according to their weight, which corres-
ponds to the number of molecules shared by the adjacent ver-
tices. This weight has an effect on some of the layout methods
and moreover can be used to ﬁlter out edges using the sliders
provided on the bottom of the main window. Each node corres-
ponds to a protein, which is deﬁned using the UniProt accession
number. Additionally, the ﬁrst ﬁve gene names and a more de-
scriptive name are stored for each protein, whereby the ﬁrst gene
name serves as the node label owing to conciseness and human
readability considerations. The descriptive name is displayed on
mouseover. All available names (ID, gene names and preferred
names) are preﬁx-searchable using the search panel at the
bottom of the main window.

Most of the network visualization can be controlled by intuitive
mouse commands (e.g. dragging nodes, zooming and selecting
nodes), which are readily provided by the Prefuse library and
had only to be associated to some additional scenario-dependent
behaviour. The right mouse button opens a context menu that
allows the user to restrict the network display to the currently
selected nodes. Moreover, it provides an interface to specify an
activity proﬁle to retrieve compounds that match this proﬁle.
Each protein can get an activity threshold (in log units) assigned,
which serves either as a lower limit (target) or as an upper limit
(anti-target). The right-hand side of the GUI shows the currently
speciﬁed proﬁle, as well as a list of compounds that meet these
requirements. This list can be exported as an SD ﬁle contained the
structure and their activities to be used in subsequent experiments.

In conclusion, the ChEMBLSpace explorer provides an intui-
tive way to explore the chemogenomic space that is covered in a
data source and helps the user not only to specify a desired ac-
tivity proﬁle but also to discover non-obvious relationships
amongst proteins and protein families. Furthermore, using an
interactive network visualization allows for the exploitation of
the powerful pattern recognition capabilities of the human visual
cognition, which might help to reveal connections between
remote target classes for which a user would not query a data-
base explicitly.

The source code of all developed programs is hosted as a
Sourceforge project (https://sourceforge.net/projects/chembl—
space) and is available under a Berkeley Software Distribution
(BSD)-type license. Moreover, we provide a tutorial, the scripts
and the Konstanz Information Miner (KNIME) workﬁow that
have been used to create the local database, an SQL dump of the
chemogenomic database at the time the tool was developed, as
well as the data ﬁles used by the applet. The scripts and workﬁow
also provide a simple starting point to create the polypharmacol-
ogy database using alternative (e. g. internal) data resources,
which subsequently can be used to extract the ﬂat ﬁles to allow
users to explore different chemogenomic spaces.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many models and analysis of signaling pathways have
been proposed. However, neither of them takes into account that
a biological pathway is not a fixed system, but instead it depends
on the organism, tissue and cell type as well as on physiological,
pathological and experimental conditions.

Results: The Biological Connection Markup Language (BCML) is
a format to describe, annotate and visualize pathways. BCML is
able to store multiple information, permitting a selective view of the
pathway as it exists and/or behave in specific organisms, tissues
and cells. Furthermore, BCML can be automatically converted into
data formats suitable for analysis and into a fully SBGN-compliant
graphical representation, making it an important tool that can be used
by both computational biologists and ‘wet Iab’ scientists.
Availability and implementation: The XML schema and the BCML
software suite are freely available under the LGPL for download
at http://bcm|.dc-at|as.net. They are implemented in Java and
supported on MS Windows, Linux and OS X.

1 INTRODUCTION

In a famous commentary regarding systems biology (Lazebnik,
2004), Yury Lazebnik, using the analogy between biological
pathways and electronic circuits, proposed the use of standard
procedures through which even a biologist—without any speciﬁc
knowledge—could ﬁx a radio. One of the most challenging goals
of modern biology is to decipher and describe the complexity of
cell systems, and what Lazebnik pointed out is that without the
integration of knowledge coming from different ﬁelds of science,
the efforts of reverse engineering the cell are destined to fail.

lThe authors wish it to be known that, in their Opinion, the ﬁrst three authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Recently, research on system biology has been characterized by
an increasing number of efforts to deﬁne common languages for
sharing information in multidisciplinary areas (Abbott, 1999) with
the aim to develop tools to describe accurate models, run effective
simulations, Visualize, analyze and integrate high—throughput data.
Networks deﬁned on studies about the interactions occurring within
cell macromolecules are key elements for this research.

Existing biological networks can be classiﬁed into four
categories, depending on the nature of their nodes and their
interactions: metabolic pathways, molecular interactions, gene
regulatory networks and signaling pathways (Li and Davidson,
2009; Wang et al., 2007). There are many public resources
which store and share representations of these networks
including KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000), Reactome (Vastrik
et al., 2007), Biocarta (www.biocarta.org), Pathway Commons
(www.pathwaycommons.org) and Wikipathways (Pico et al., 2008),
yet currently there is no gold standard on how biological pathways
should be represented. This shortcoming affects particularly
signaling pathways: without solid, consistent and unambiguous
representations, hypotheses and analyses based on them are affected
by an inability to do any proper computational analysis in the
worst case, and a loss of power, in the best case. Furthermore, a
proper representation of a pathway is important to enable efﬁcient
knowledge management and integration of data coming from
multiple sources. Recent efforts on the representation of pathways
have followed two main trends: a proper graphical representation
and a machine—readable format.

On the basis of the existence and the use of graphical and machine—
readable formats, pathway representations can be classiﬁed into
three categories (Pan et al., 2003): static, providing a non—modiﬁable
graphical representation; semi—dynamic, representing information
not only as a graphical map, but also using a corresponding machine—
readable format, which is not, however, strongly interconnected
with the graph; dynamic, where the graphical representation format
depends directly on the underlying data model, and thus any
modiﬁcation in the latter can be immediately translated to the former.
At the time of writing, all pathway representations stored in public
databases are either static or semi—dynamic.

The most recent example of a pure graphical representation
is the System Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN)

(Le Novere et al., 2009). SBGN splits the representation of a
biological network into three different levels (the process deﬁnition,
the entity relationship and the activity ﬂow language). The three
representations are constructed in order to capture different aspects
of the biological systems, deﬁning a set of glyphs and constraints
to reduce ambiguity and improve interpretation. The resulting
representations are highly informative, and SB GN quickly achieved
a broad consensus in the scientiﬁc community. However, despite
ongoing efforts (Czaudema et al., 2010), an SBGN—dedicated
pathway repository does not exist yet, and the conversion from the
existing pathway representations to SBGN format is still difﬁcult,
due to the higher level of speciﬁcations and the deeper knowledge
required.

Machine—readable formats, on the other hand, aim at creating a
representation of the pathway that can be read and interpreted by
computer programs and used to perform analyses or predictions.
Many formats have been proposed through the years, such as the
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) (Hucka et al., 2003)
and the Biological Pathways eXchange (BioPAX) (Luciano, 2005).
Although these initiatives are successful results of the joint efforts
of a wider community, they are still incomplete and no one has
truly been adopted as a community—wide standard. This is mostly
due to the fact that the underlying biological problem and its
associated complexity is hard to model into a data format, especially
with regards to signaling cascades. Signaling cascades are coherent
patterns of expression that happen through a pathway in a speciﬁc
condition.

The complexity of the modeling of signal transduction (signaling)
in pathways is due to many factors. Signaling pathways are formal
descriptions of the signaling processes by which a cell converts
certain signals into others, involving interconnected, ﬁnely regulated
structures that may present a high level of redundancy. Also, these
structures are integrated in a larger system and are affected by
environmental—dependent changes. A further source of complexity
lies in the fact that different cell types express different genes (or
the same entities may be present in different cellular compartments)
and thus produce different proteins, leading to signiﬁcant alterations
in the design of a speciﬁc signaling pathway.

This complexity makes precise modeling extremely difﬁcult. As
a matter of fact, the current pathway databases represent pathways
regardless of the cell type and tissue they occur in. An imprecise
model affects the capabilities of the analyses carried out with it (such
as the statistical power to detect the pathways that are signiﬁcantly
impacted in a given condition), since it will not make use of the
complete biological information available. With the intention to be
more informative, pathway analysis research in recent years moved
from analysis of gene lists to more complex algorithms able to
exploit the topology of networks. The extraction of the topological
information from a biological pathway and their interpretation to
obtain a network is not a trivial task and are still extremely dependent
on the level of detailed information provided by the data format
(Alves et al., 2006; Draghici et al., 2007; Kashtan et al., 2004;
Massa et al., 2010).

Here, we present the Biological Connection Markup Language
(BCML), a bioinformatic framework that allows to design
and to manage the representation of signaling pathways in a
visual and machine—readable format that respects the SBGN
speciﬁcations. This format allows an unambiguous and fully
dynamic representation of signaling pathways that is useful for both

the biologists and bioinformaticians. In the framework, any type of
biological information (either gene identiﬁers, publications or other
information) can be added to the elements of a BCML pathway
to provide additional information on their presence in the pathway
and their relationships. Lastly, since BCML is a machine—readable
format, the conversion into other data formats is straightforward,
with the possibility of contextual selection of elements.

2 METHODS
2.1 XML schema

An XML schema describing the complete SBGN Process Description version
1.1 was implemented according to the SBGN documentation (Supplementary
Material). An additional schema, implementing support for ﬁndings, was
written as an extension of the main SBGN schema. A set of utilities to
validate, ﬁlter and extract entities from the schema was also developed in
the Java programming language (Supplementary Material).

2.2 Dataset preprocessing

A set of dendritic cell samples unstimulated or stimulated with poly(I:C)
and hybridized on Affymetrix microarrays was retrieved from Array
Express (accession code E—MEXP—1230). Data were then pre—processed and
normalized using the Robust Multichip Average (Irizarry et al., 2003) while
at the same time updating the chip deﬁnitions with up—to—date versions linked
to Entrez Gene IDs (Dai et al., 2005). Preprocessing was carried out using
RMAExpress, version 1.0.

2.3 Differential expression

Differentially expressed genes were calculated by running the Rank Product
algorithm (Breitling et al., 2004) on the dataset. Each donor was considered
a separate origin. To ensure statistical signiﬁcance, the maximum cut—off for
the percentage of false positives (pfp) was set at 0.05. The computation
was performed with the Bioconductor package ‘RankProd’ using the R
programming language.

2.4 Pathway analysis
The deﬁnition of the Toll—like receptor 3 (TLR3) pathway as described
by the DC—ATLAS initiative (Cavalieri et al., 2010) was used to create a
BCML implementation of the pathway. The existing deﬁnition was expanded
to include entities belonging to additional cell types and tissues. The
reference deﬁnition of the TLR3 pathway was retrieved from Reactome
(http://www.reactome.org) as a gene list.

The BCML ﬁle was then converted to gene list and to a format usable by
SPIA, the R implementation of impact analysis (Tarca et 01., 2009).

The hypergeometric test was carried out on the gene lists using R. SPIA
was performed with a modiﬁed package (to support custom pathways), using
the differentially expressed genes obtained from previous analyses.

3 IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 Data format

In order to provide a human— and machine—readable format that is
able to properly represent and analyze pathways, and with the feature
of being compliant with the SBGN speciﬁcations, we developed
a data format based on the SBGN Process Deﬁnition (PD) 1.1
speciﬁcation (Supplementary Material).

BCML was deﬁned using an XML Schema (http://www.w3.org/
XML/Schema; Supplementary Material), supporting the complete
SBGN PD deﬁnition, including entities, interactions, rules and

BCML

 

restraints. The various SBGN elements are deﬁned as XML tags,
with additional properties stored in tag attributes.

In addition to a full implementation of the SBGN speciﬁcation,
BCML provides a series of optional features (deﬁned as extensions
of the main schema). First of all, BCML can include additional
information on the entities that compose the network: each entity
be described by a series of database identiﬁers, e.g. Entrez
Gene or Uniprot accession numbers and each species can have
its independent set of identiﬁers. Furthermore, condition—speciﬁc
information, called ‘Findings’, can be associated to each entity or
reaction. ‘Findings’ are collections of biological information that
are relevant to that entity or reaction. The current speciﬁcation
includes support for organism, organism part (tissue), cell type, the
speciﬁc biological environment in which the evidence was proven
and the type of the experiment used to gather evidence. To reduce
ambiguity and promote consistency among different ‘Findings’, the
schema enforces a controlled vocabulary built from current medical
ontologies.

The BCML schema also provides support to split pathways
into subpathways called ‘macro modules’, representing independent
units of a signaling pathway, following the proposal brought forward
by the DC—ATLAS initiative (http://www.dc—atlas.net) as part of the
DC—THERA network of excellence (http://www.dc—thera.org).

Lastly, even though it is mostly focused on the biological data and
its analysis, BCML also contains support for a number of graphical
hints, such as border, background and text colors of the elements
(while the original SBGN speciﬁcation is monochromatic). These
hints are recognized and processed by the tools we developed that
can read and parse BCML ﬁles.

All the additions to the SBGN speciﬁcation are completely
optional. The layer structure of the format allows the use of
additional data types without affecting the SBGN compliance.

3.2 BCML software suite

To support the use of the format, we developed a series of tools
to ensure the proper description, manipulation and visualization
of pathways using BCML. Through the use of the software suite,
a pathway described in BCML can be checked for consistency
(validation), represented according to the SBGN speciﬁcation
(graphical representation), speciﬁc elements can be excluded or
included according to the user’s criteria (contextual selection),
experimental measurements can be added to the representation and
data analysis with different methods can be carried out.

3.2.] Data validation We developed a validation tool to ensure
that BCML ﬁles are well formed. First of all, the validator
ensures that the BCML ﬁle is well formed according to the XML
speciﬁcation, and secondly the network is examined for consistency,
using rules and constraints deﬁned by SBGN. In case of improperly
constructed ﬁles, the tool then reports to the user which elements are
breaking the speciﬁcation. Lastly, the tool ensures that identiﬁers for
each element are unique and that isolated entities are not present.

3.2.2 Graphical representation Since pathways described in
BCML are XML ﬁles, appropriate tools can convert the BCML
representation of a pathway into a number of other formats suitable
for direct graphical representation.

No additional requirements are needed to produce a graphical
representation out of a BCML ﬁle, as the structure of the format

already contains all the needed information, which is then used by
the software suite to produce a SB GN—compliant graph. The current
implementation converts BCML ﬁles into GraphML, a widely used
format for graph representation. BCML ﬁles converted to GraphML
can be opened by programs such as the yEd graph editor, where they
can be exported to vector graphs or bitmap images (Supplementary
Material).

3.2.3 Contextual selection The tools present in the BCML
software suite allow the on—the—ﬂy customization of the pathway,
taking advantage of the information stored in the format. For
example, nodes and edges can be selected for a speciﬁc cell type or
organism, allowing the construction of customized network maps to
represent speciﬁc biological contexts. As an example, some elements
of a speciﬁc pathway may be demonstrated in some cell types and
not in others: BCML allows to create maps that include or exclude
the elements that belong to a speciﬁc cell type.

The speciﬁcation takes into account also elements and
connections that may not be present given the selections, e. g. if
in a speciﬁc cell type a complex may not form if one or more of its
proteins are not present, marking them as ‘affected by the selections’,
and providing a way to guide the analysis and the data interpretation
and to point out gaps in current knowledge.

The results of the selection will also affect the graphical
representation, as elements will be marked differently depending
on their state (Supplementary Material).

3.2.4 Incorporation of experimental measurements Through the
use of SBGN’s StateVariable, the BCML format can incorporate
any kind of experimental measurements that can be matched to
the identiﬁers of an element. This permits, for example, to map
high—throughput data coming from transcriptomics or proteomics
experiments and to determine which elements of the pathway are
affected in a given condition/tissue/organism. Measurements can be
coupled with graphical hints so that when the pathway is converted to
graphical representation, elements with experimental measurements
will be colored accordingly (Fig. 1).

3.2.5 Support for analysis methods The presence of identiﬁers
associated to the entities of a network described with BCML permits
the transformation of the pathway in different data format suitable
for data analysis. The tools provided with the suite permit the
extraction of identiﬁer (gene) lists from a BCML ﬁle, enabling their
use with analysis methods such as Gene Set Enrichment Analysis
(GSEA) and Fisher’s exact test. Additionally, the format can be
converted in a form amenable for impact analysis through the SPIA
R package, enabling a topology—aware analysis of the network.

The conversion can take into account the contextual selection
applied to the elements of the pathway, allowing analyses tailored
for the user’s experimental designs.

The tools are freely available and open source. A complete manual
illustrating the use of the format and the tools is also included
(Supplementary Material).

4 COMPARISON WITH ESTABLISHED FORMATS

4.1 Comparison with other formats

In order to assess the capabilities of BCML, we compared our
format with the standards for the description of pathways that are
most widely used by the scientiﬁc community: KGML, BioPAX and
SBML (Table 1).

KGML is an XML—based format provided by the KEGG pathway
database, deﬁned by a speciﬁc Document Template Deﬁnition
(DTD). KGML is the only pathway database currently offering
pathway data in this format. Both BCML and KGML have a
corresponding graphical visualization: in addition to what KGML
offers, BCML has also support for compartment information and
the additional features provided by SBGN. KGML is not SBGN
compliant. The graphical representation of KGML is not derived by
the format itself, but provided by KEGG directly as an image. This
choice adds a manual process of translation from the format to the
image, with potential discrepancy between the KGML entity and the
graphical representation.

KGML and BCML support annotations for the entities of the
pathway, in two different ways. KGML uses different ﬁles for
different organism, while BCML incorporates these information in
the format itself. When compared with KGML, BCML supports a
wider number of annotations, such as cell type, organism and tissue.

KGML allows the coloring of the genes of the pathway through
the supplied graphical representation: changes in interactions and/or
in the pathway layout are not supported. BCML can instead use

information not only to provide coloring of the entries (through
the addition of experimental measurements), but also contextual
selection of the elements basing on the annotation.

BioPAX is a format based on the Ontology Web Language (OWL),
a derivative of XML based on subject—predicate—complement
triplets, and is deﬁned on multiple levels. Currently, it is used by
many databases and resources, the most important being Reactome.
Like BCML, it supports different types of pathways, including
signaling pathways (starting from the recently released level 3 of
the speciﬁcation). It also supports annotation in a similar manner as
BCML does. Both BCML and BioPAX supports contextual selection
of the elements, in different ways: BioPAX, through the use of third—
party tools, uses SPARQL to create a tabular output of the pathway,
while BCML generates a second BCML ﬁle which is a subset of the
initial pathway. This subset is a perfectly valid BCML ﬁle, which
keeps all the features of the format. Therefore, when using BCML to
perform contextual selection, no information is lost, as the original
pathway is preserved.

With regard to graphical representation, BioPAX and BCML
have a different design. BioPAX’s ofﬁcial representation is SBGN:
however, at the time of writing a tool that permits a direct conversion
from BioPAX to SBGN and vice versa does not exist, although the
BioPAX speciﬁcation deﬁnes guidelines on how to convert from
one format to another. External tools such as Cytoscape, through
additional plug—ins, can produce a graphical visualization, although
not SBGN compliant: for example, since Cytoscape models the
pathway structure on a mathematical graph some structures required
by SBGN, such as complexes, cannot be represented. On the other
hand, as BCML is modeled on the SBGN speciﬁcation itself, it can
be automatically and directly transformed into a fully compliant
graphical representation.

SBML is an XML—based purely computational format. It is used
mainly to model biochemical reactions, due to its ability to annotate
quantitatively the elements, but it also can be employed to describe
signaling pathways. It is widely used in the scientiﬁc community
and many different tools support this format. SBML, like BCML,
supports annotations that can be added to elements using a controlled
vocabulary. SBML is designed for the stoichiometry aspects of the
reactions, while BCML is designated for the signaling aspects of the
pathway. Additionally, SBML does not store the pathway layout in
a standard fashion: the different tools that manipulate SBML either
generate automatic layouts or use additional storage or deﬁnitions
to store these information. BCML uses instead the terminology and
the constraints of SBGN. Due to the way SBML is designed and its
focus, contextual selection is not possible, because the model does
not store biological information such as cell type or organism.

4.2 The Toll-like receptor 3 pathway as an example of
BCML implementation

To properly evaluate the effectiveness of BCML in representing
pathways, we retrieved the deﬁnition of the Toll—like receptor 3
(TLR3) pathway, a receptor involved in the immune recognition
of double—stranded RNA, from two different sources: a reference
implementation represented by the TLR3 pathway as stored in
the Reactome database and a BCML version, as described in the
Methods section. The BCML format was also transformed in its
corresponding graphical output (Supplementary Material).

To determine the feasibility of the format for analysis methods,
we tested BCML using a publicly available dataset (E—MEXP—1230
from Array Express), containing gene expression measurements on
human dendritic cell samples stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic
double—stranded RNA homologue that is recognized by TLR3. An
additional feature of the BCML implementation was the ability of
mapping differentially expressed genes (DEGs) directly inside the
pathway format (Supplementary Material).

As a subsequent step, we converted our implementation to a
gene list and performed the Fisher’s exact test using the previously
calculated DEGs alongside the Reactome reference. The reference
implementation from Reactome yielded, as expected, a signiﬁcant
P—value of 0.00525. The test on the BCML implementation
resulted in an improvement of the result signiﬁcant P—value
(P = 8.21565038223e—14; Table 2). The difference between the two
results was due to the different level of curation in DC—ATLAS and
Reactome.

In order to demonstrate the importance of having dynamic
pathways and more informative data formats, we also tested the
effect of contextual selection on the analysis (Table 2). The BCML
implementation of the TLR3 pathway was modiﬁed selecting only
the elements and reactions with evidence in human dendritic cells
like the experimental setup, and analyses were reperformed. Results
showed the P—values more signiﬁcant by an approximately one order
of magnitude indicating that more speciﬁc pathways lead to more
informative analyses.

Due to its highly informative format, BCML is able to support
automated analysis also on topology—dependent algorithms. Thus,
we analyzed the data using a method that takes into account the
relationships and the connections among elements (Impact analysis).
We obtained a signiﬁcant P—value and information on the trend
of the data (pathway activated; Table 3). Analysis on the ﬁltered
TLR3 pathway yielded lower P—values than the complete pathway,
an indication that ﬁltering increases sensitivity and speciﬁcity. The
results were in agreement with the Fisher’s test.

These ﬁndings indicate that BCML format is as ﬂexible as
the already established public formats but also offers additional
functionality missing in the publicly available counterparts.

5 DISCUSSION

In this work, we have presented BCML, a new data format designed
for the representation of process description speciﬁcation of the

SBGN data model for the representation of biological networks.
Moreover, our format was designed to provide signiﬁcant additional
capabilities, dramatically increasing the amount of information that
it can store and offering additional ﬂexibility. These additional
capabilities are useful for both biological interpretation and data
analysis.

The aim that guided the development of BCML was to build a
ﬂexible and dynamic representation of biological pathways in an
unambiguous way, while still being understandable by the biologist,
being able to improve the available analysis and supporting features
such as contextual selection, extended annotation and graphical
visualization. We chose XML because it is highly ﬂexible, easily
parseable and simply transformable into other formats. Moreover,
XML is an easy to learn language and a well—designed schema
(e.g. using descriptive and self—explanatory tags) allows an easy
to understand reading of the ﬁles produced with it, also for
people with limited computer skills (Barillot and Achard, 2000).
Also, specialized XML editors can create easily understandable
data models composed of entities nested on multiple levels. Such
available editors also facilitate XML content visualization.

The adoption the SBGN model ensures that BCML is able to
represent the major part of the bulk of biological information in an
unambiguous way, and at the same time, is compatible with the most
recent graphical standard for biological pathways.

Before developing a new format, we examined KGML, BioPAX
(Luciano, 2005) and SBML (Hucka et al., 2003). Each of the formats
provided features that we needed, but neither covered exactly our
use case. SBML had a different focus, modeling quantitative and
temporal aspects, than our intended goal and did not properly support
a graphical representation. KGML was not detailed enough to
capture all the required information, and BioPAX did not implement
at the time of writing some of our requirements, for example
generation of subpathways from contextual selection. Also, KGML
and SBML did not offer SBGN—compliant representations, while
BioPAX required an additional step of conversion.

One of the most important problems we faced when building this
model was the fact that in general terms, most pathways available
in public databases are ‘generic’. Although most pathways are
organism speciﬁc, they lack information on the precise cellular types
or tissues in which the described phenomena take place. Even more
seriously, many publicly available pathways combine in a single
diagram elements that are speciﬁc only to certain tissues (Cavalieri
et al., 2010). Since the commonly used pathway databases do not
currently store information about tissue localization, a life scientist
unfamiliar with the minutiae of a speciﬁc pathway could easily and
incorrectly infer that these genes would be involved in this pathway
in all cells. In contrast, a tool relying on BCML can display (on
request) only those elements of the pathways that are known to
be applicable in the currently selected organism and tissue type,

and supported by the level of proof speciﬁed by the user. Thus, one
single BCML pathway representation can capture all the information
available about that pathway for all organisms, tissue types, type of
evidence, etc., as well as experimentally measured values such as
gene expression, protein abundance, etc.

We are strongly convinced that the most improvements in the
analysis of pathway will come from a better use of the already
existing knowledge. For this reason, we needed formats able not
only to store additional information (ﬁndings) about a pathway, but
also to be able to include or exclude elements based on such existing
knowledge thus enabling the creation of ‘customized’ pathways,
better suited to describe speciﬁc biological problems or to highlights
gaps in our current knowledge.

BCML is our proposal to overcome this lack of ﬂexibility in the
current available data formats for pathways. The constraints set by
BCML, which reﬂect the ones set up by SBGN, are also important
in ensuring that a pathway will be designed in the correct form from
the start. Moreover, in BCML we added the possibility to integrate
experimental measurements as a way to improve interpretation of
experimental results.

Lastly, we wanted to construct a format that could facilitate
subsequent analyses, because the use of pathways to perform
analysis, especially in the context of high—throughput data, is an
expanding ﬁeld (Cavalieri and De Filippo, 2005; Werner, 2008).
BCML can, through very simple transformations, be used both for
gene list—based approaches such as GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005)
or the canonical Fisher’s Exact Test (Draghici et al., 2003; Grosu
et al., 2002), and as well as the more advanced, topology—aware
methods such as Impact Analysis (Tarca et al., 2009). Furthermore,
the contextual selection can also be applied when transforming
the data for analysis, thus permitting analyses ‘tailored’ to speciﬁc
biological problems.

In order to ensure that our format had an advantage, according to
our design, to the already existing formats, we compared two speciﬁc
implementations of the Toll—like receptor 3, a receptor involved in
the dendritic cell response to double—stranded RNA (Kawai and
Akira, 2007; Meylan and Tschopp, 2006): one represented using our
format, and as the other we used the one stored in the Reactome
pathway database, which we used as established reference. We
then used a publicly available dataset to test the reliability of the
implementation applied to data analysis: we expected an activation
of the TLR3 pathway, because the dataset contained dendritic
cells stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic homolog of the dsRNA
recognized by the receptor.

Our results showed that the BCML representation of the TLR3
pathway performs as well as the established reference, while offering
important additional features, such as the possibility of incorporating
experimental measurements, the possibility of using topology—
aware analysis algorithms and the contextual selection of elements
according to a speciﬁc biological context: when compared to the
use of different pathways in the same species, such an approach is
more powerful as it can be used to highlight subtle differences in
signaling networks among different cell types or tissues.

With regards to classical analysis methods, both Reactome and
the BCML implementations of TLR3 gave signiﬁcant P—values for
TLR3 pathway. The discrepancy in the results of the statistical
test is not related to the format, but it is an expression of the
different curation in the standard (Reactome) and DC—ATLAS
(Cavalieri et al., 2010), where the BCML implementation of TLR3

was taken from. This shows that our implementation of TLR3
is comparable to established standards when using an external,
focused dataset. Additionally, BCML provides the possibility of
using topology—aware analysis methods such as Impact Analysis,
which are more precise as they take into account the order and the
causal relationships among the various entities.

For both methods, using a subset of the TLR3 pathway produced
by contextual selection, keeping into account the speciﬁc biological
context, yielded P—values lower by one order of magnitude with
respect to the generic implementation. This result is of particular
importance because it clearly shows the need for pathway deﬁnitions
that match as closely as possible the biological context that is
being investigated, leading to more robust and precise results. As a
matter of fact, pathways and cellular networks exhibit even greater
differences between species (Mestas and Huges, 2005; Shen—Orr
et al., 2010), and even more importantly, the cell type is an even
greater discriminating factor: for example, in the TLR3 pathway, the
presence of >50% of its known genes has not been demonstrated
in dendritic cells (Cavalieri et al., 2010). Thus, when using the
pathway deﬁnition for computational analysis, it is essential to be
as close as possible to the experimental setup to prevent or notice
inconsistencies that will ultimately affect the ﬁnal interpretation of
the results. Despite BCML’s lack of reﬁnement compared to the
currently available alternatives, it provides additional functionality,
and it highlights a possible solution to problems that are now
arising when representing pathways. Thanks to the selection
capabilities of BCML, it is possible to construct speciﬁc pathways
for ‘tailored’ analyses. Such selection can be used both by the
biologist to visualize the non—demonstrated interactions and to
the bioinformatician who can adjust the analysis methods to take
missing annotations into account.

BCML only covers Process Description at the moment, while a
complete SBGN representation of the pathway should also includes
the Entity Relationship and Activity Flow representation. We will
work toward implementing these two speciﬁcation in order to
provide a more complete data model for all the SBGN graphical
pathway descriptions. We will also work on developing tools
to convert BCML to other formats such as BioPAX to increase
interoperability.

One of the major strengths of this work is that the format was
conceived in parallel with the implementation of ﬂexible tools
for the representation, manipulation and analysis of biological
networks. We are hereby making available to the community, not
only an abstract data model for a possible large adoption, but also
the basic tools that allow the manipulation of pathways in this
format.

Being SBGN compliant and machine readable, BCML provides
a convenient and precise way to represent biological pathways,
in a form useful to both the biologist and the bioinformatician.
Its dynamic nature makes it an important tool for the dissection
of complex, highly speciﬁc biological problems. Lastly, BCML
containing deeper descriptions of biological knowledge turns out
to be a format extremely suitable for advanced pathway analysis
methods, as well as creation of knowledge—based online resources.
We expect that our model will be a useful contribution to the pathway
community, making possible the creation of more practical and
more complete pathway representations that will be both more end—
user friendly, as well as better suited for advanced computational
analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Many secondary messengers, receptors and transcription
factors are related to cell differentiation. Their role in cell differentiation
can be affected by their position in the gene regulatory network. Here,
we test whether the properties of the gene regulatory network can
highlight which genes and proteins are associated with cell differenti-
ation. We use a previously developed purely theoretical algorithm built
to detect nodes that can induce a state change in Boolean gene regu-
latory networks, and show that most genes predicted to participate in
differentiation in the theoretical framework are also experimentally
known to be associated with such differentiation. These results
show that genes related to differentiation are associated with specific
features of the genetic regulatory network. The proposed algorithm
produces a better classification than simple network measures such
as the nodes degree or centrality. Boolean networks were used in
many previous theoretical models. Here, we show a direct application
of such networks to the detection of genes and subnetworks related to
differentiation. The subnetwork emerging from the genes and edges
that are predicted to be associated with differentiation are the most
active molecular pathways experimentally described to be involved in
cell differentiation.

1 INTRODUCTION

During differentiation, stem cells are converted to become new
types of cells. The converted cells can become similar to the cells
that triggered the differentiation, which is often the case with
differentiation of adult stem cells, or they may become a different
cell type. This can happen in transdifferentiation or during dif-
ferentiation of tissue stem cells from a nearby non-neighboring
cell population. For example, the cells in the mesenchyme may

send differentiation signals to the stem cells of the epithelium
(Alonso and Fuchs, 2003; Krause et al., 2001).

Some genes and their products are classically related to cell
differentiation in the literature, as they play a key role in at least
one case where one cell type is converted to another. These genes
include, e. g. the members of signaling pathways related to cell
differentiation such as the epidermal growth factor (EGF) sig-
naling pathway (Herbst, 2004), the transforming growth factor
beta signaling pathway (Moustakas et al., 2002) and the nerve
growth factor signaling pathway (Klesse et al., 1999). These
genes and their products share different biophysical and func-
tional properties. Some are growth factors acting as extracellular
signals. Others are the corresponding ligand receptors. Other
signaling proteins transmit the differentiation signal to the
nucleus. There, transcription factors and other proteins regulate
chromatin structure and gene expression.

To model differentiation we use Boolean networks, which
have been shown to produce multiple features of regulatory
gene networks (Kauffman, 1993). Furthermore, Boolean net-
works can approximate well the continuous expression profiles
of genes (Martin et al., 2007; Serra et al., 2007) (Serra et al.,
2004). We developed a theoretical algorithm to detect, using a
random Boolean gene regulatory network, which genes and their
products can participate in computer-simulated differentiation-
like events (Bodaker et al., 2013). Here, we show that genes
related to this in silico differentiation are associated with differ-
entiation as documented in the literature.

Multiple supervised machine learning algorithms have been
proposed to classify genes into categories, using gene expression
patterns (Eisen et al., 1998; Gibbons and Roth, 2002; Zhou et al.,
2002) or properties of the protein interaction network (Deng
et al., 2003a; Hishigaki et al., 2001; Karaoz et al., 2004;
Schwikowski et al., 2000; Sharan et al., 2007; Vazquez et al.,
2003). Here, we propose a novel approach to deﬁne genes related
to differentiation based on ﬁrst principles and not on blind
machine learning algorithms.

The function of genes and proteins is typically studied using
their sequence/ structure, expression pattern and biochemical
interactions. However, the function of genes may actually be
induced by or at least correlated with the position of its protein
in the genetic regulatory and protein—protein interactions net-
work. Here, we show that first principles on the expected dy-
namics of networks can help detecting genes correlated with
differentiation.

Gene regulatory network structure

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Model organism and data processing

To study cell differentiation, we used the curated genetic regulatory net-
work of Cui et al. (2007). A basic concept in Boolean networks is that
each node has at least one regulator, which determines its Boolean value
at each time step. Therefore, genes that have no regulators were removed
from the network (recursively). Another set of genes that were removed
(again recursively) are genes that do not regulate other genes. These genes
have no effect on the dynamics of the network, and their removal has no
effect on the results. The resulting processed network contains 435 nodes
(the vast majority are genes or their products) and 1550 edges between
them, 1196 of which are of positive regulation and 354 are of negative
regulation. The network has seven small loops, each with two genes.
There was a single large multiply connected component containing 418
genes. Some of the small loops were found to inﬂuence the large multiply
connected loop, whereas others were found to be inﬂuenced by it. By
deﬁnition, none of the small loops both inﬂuences and is inﬂuenced by
the large multiply connected loop. The three remaining genes connected
the different loops. Because the small loops that inﬂuence the large one
were likely to create a bias, the analysis was performed using only the
large multiply connected loop, which will be denoted as the ‘human
network’ (HN) in the following sections. In Supplementary Section S1,
we discuss the detailed effect of the removal of the small loops.
In Supplementary Section S2, we present the small loops.

The HN has an average degree of 3.6 :I: 3.8, and a scale-free distribu-
tion for both the in- and the out-degree (Supplementary Section S3). The
typical distance between nodes in the graph is approximately a Poisson
distribution with a typical distance of 6 :I: 2 (Supplementary Section S3)
and a relatively low clustering coefﬁcient of 0.03. These features are simi-
lar to what is often reported in regulatory networks (Ahn et al., 2009;
Gama-Castro et al., 2011; Itzhack et al., 2013).

2.2 Theoretical model for cellular differentiation

2.2.1 Boolean networks The edges between the genes and their signs
provide only partial information for the deﬁnition of a Boolean network.
The regulatory function of each gene (describing how it is inﬂuenced by
its regulatory genes, 6. g. NAND) must be given as well. There are mul-
tiple options for each gene, e.g. a gene with two positive regulators may
have AND or OR as its regulatory function. Because setting the regula-
tory function for gene is independent of the other genes, the total number
of Boolean networks that are consistent with the HN data is at least
exponential to the number of genes that have more than a single regulator
(which are the vast majority of the genes). Thus, the HN represents a
family of Boolean networks, consistent with the HN data.

Here, we assign a Boolean function consistent with the number of
activators and repressors each gene has. These Boolean functions are
called nested canalyzing Boolean functions, as will be explained. Harris
et al. (2002) have shown that the functions describing genetic regulation
in eukaryotes are canalyzing. Kauffman et al. (2004) reanalyzed these
data and have shown that practically all the functions of gene regulation
in eukaryotes are nested canalyzing Boolean functions (NCBF) (see
Supplementary Section S4 for deﬁnition and example). Thus, although
there are many possible ways to reproduce a random Boolean network
from observed networks, the choice of nested canalyzing functions seems
to be the most appropriate from a biological point of View. Given this
deﬁnition, the network produced is based on the selection of the hierarchy
of the variables in the nested canalyzing function, which was random in
this case, as no information was available on the hierarchy between each
gene’s regulators (Supplementary Section S4).

2.2.2 Computer-simulated diﬁ’erentiation-like events in random
Boolean networks We have previously developed a general frame-
work to model differentiation-like events in random Boolean networks

(Bodaker et al., 2013). We investigated these differentiation-like events in
systems based on random Boolean networks given a set of signaling
nodes and two cycles. Basically, we studied networks that can converge
to at least two different cycles. A cycle is a ﬁnite cyclic set of states of the
network that a Boolean network can converge to (each cycle has a ﬁnite
number of steps that evolve in time from one to the other and ﬁnally the
last step evolves to the ﬁrst one). Given such a network, we studied two
cells (both represented by similar networks) each resting in a different
cycle, and tested whether using a given subset of the nodes in one cell as
inputs to the other cell can drive the second cell to be in the same cycle as
the ﬁrst cell. We denote the cell changing its cycle as the induced cell and
the other cell as the inducing cell.

2.2.3 Unsynchronized conversions From the biological point of view
most adult tissues are in steady state, with new cells being produced
continuously to offset the number of dying cells. Thus, constant differ-
entiation of tissue stem cells is observed in multiple adult organs, such as
the intestine, the skin and blood (Barker et al., 2010; Pittenger et al.,
1999). This led us to model differentiation as a change in a simulated
cell that is independent in the initial step both of the cycle the induced cell
rests in and of the cycle the inducing cell rests in. We named the differ-
entiation-like events as unsynchronized quality conversion (UQC), which
occurs if the induced cell always changes its cycle to the same cycle,
following signals from the inducing cell. For UQC to occur, we require
that the conversion should not depend on the phase of the two cycles. The
cycle that the induced cycle converged to is referred to as the target cycle.
A detailed technical deﬁnition of UQC in a network is given in Bodaker
et al. (2013).

2.2.4 Algorithm for detecting candidate nodes to enable the differ-
entiation-like events Based on the UQC concept, we have developed
an a priori algorithm to detect nodes that can serve as signaling nodes
between two cycles and induce UQC. Although the detailed mathematical
details of the algorithm were previously explained (Bodaker et al., 2013),
we here provide a short explanation of the basic principles driving this
algorithm, see Supplementary Section S5 for the detailed steps of the
algorithm. Each node in the network represents a gene or a protein.
The algorithm works mostly by elimination:

(1) Eliminate nodes that behave similarly between the two cycles
(basically have the same patterns between the two cycles).

(2) Eliminate nodes that neither can close a directed circle nor link
between directed circles in the remaining graph.

(3) Eliminate the nodes that are not ﬁxed in both cycles.

(4) Select the remaining nodes as candidates to induce UQC.

We have found that if nodes are selected according to the previous
algorithm, in >90% of the cases, UQC will occur. Similar performances
of the algorithm were also obtained for Boolean networks consistent with
the HN. However, our previous work focused on the pure mathematical
aspects of the algorithm on these networks with no biological meaning
(Bodaker et al., 2013).

2.2.5 Sets of nodes derived from the algorithm As mentioned, the
algorithm works mostly by elimination. After the ﬁrst step of eliminating
the nodes that behave similarly between the cycles, the two remaining
types of nodes can be categorized: (i) nodes found in loops (which may be
multiply connected) and (ii) nodes found in simple paths (paths that do
not close a circle). The simple paths themselves can also be categorized:
(i) simple paths linking between loops and (ii) simple paths that end with
nodes that do not regulate any of the remaining nodes. These remaining
loops are referred in graph theory as strongly connected components
(SCCs). Categorizing the remaining strongly connected components
(RSCCs) is less trivial and is beyond the scope of simple deﬁnitions of
graph theory.

M. Bodaker et al.

 

To further reduce the number of converting nodes, we further elimi-
nated nodes from the signaling set, if the conversion could occur without
them. Following this removal, RSCCs can be categorized into two kinds,
the ones that contain nodes found in the reduced signaling sets and the
ones that do not contain such nodes. The nodes found in the RSCCs and
are essential for differentiation in the algorithm are the ones we believe
are the most critical nodes for the conversion to occur. Therefore,
through the following analysis, we rank all nodes by the fraction of simu-
lation, where they belong to this set of RSCCs, referred to as sufﬁcient
RSCCs. For a precise deﬁnition and explanation of the logic behind these
deﬁnitions, see a previously more theoretical analysis (Bodaker et al.,
2013, Supplementary Section S6).

2.2.6 Frequency of participation in conversions We tested whether
genes in the HN associated with the theoretical model of UQC are also
associated with cell differentiation in the literature. The genes of the HN
were sorted according to the frequency of their participation in UQC as
follows (a single simulation takes on average a couple of minutes on a
single core and the analysis presented here was performed on a grid with
32 cores):

(1) A total of 10000 Boolean networks consistent with the HN were
created. This was performed by choosing randomly, for each gene,
a Boolean function consistent with the number of activators and
repressors the gene has, according to the HN as described in
Section 2.

(2) In all, 1 000 initial random states were iterated until they converged
to different cycles.

(3) If at least two cycles were observed, two cycles were randomly
picked.

(4) The algorithm searched for candidate genes to induce UQC, as
mentioned earlier in the text.

(5) If candidate genes were found and UQC occurred and the target
cycle was native (a cycle that exists in the Boolean network in
absence of the cell—cell interactions), the score of the set of genes
within the sufﬁcient remaining strongly connected components (the
sufﬁcient RSCCs) was augmented by one.

V

The list of the genes of the HN was sorted according to their score.
This list is referred to as the ‘genes scored list’ (GSL).

2.3 GO-based gene classification

To classify genes, the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations of each gene
were retrieved using the ID converter tool (http://idconverter.bioinfo.cnio.
es/) by using their Entrez serial number. At this point, it was necessary to
determine if a G0 annotation is related to differentiation. The genes that
participate in UQC not only initiate the conversion but also maintain it.
Therefore, GO annotations related to cell differentiation and the signal-
ing pathways of the factors initiating differentiations are of interest. To
detect the GO annotations related to each gene, a two-step procedure was
used:

First, using the CateGOrizer (http://www.animalgenome.org/tools/
catego/) tool, GO annotations related to cell differentiation were
added. Then, GO annotations related to the signaling pathways of the
factors initiating differentiations were sought using the key words ‘growth
factor’ and ‘signaling pathway’ (all the results were then manually
checked to insure that they are related to relevant processes). Taking
only the genes related to cell differentiation by the CateGOrizer yielded
similar results but with a smaller number of genes. Here, we only report
the results for the full list. Results for the list produced directly by the
CateGOrizer are given in Supplementary Section S7.

2.4 Statistical methods

Rank test. To check if the order of the GSL is correlated with cellular
differentiation, we used the ‘gene set enrichment analysis rank test’
(Subramanian et al., 2005):

(1) Let q denote the proportion of the genes in the list that are related
to cellular differentiation.

(2) Create a vector of weights W, where W(i) is as follows:

A. l—q if the gene in that index in the list is related to cellular
differentiation.

B. —q otherwise.
(3) Compute the cumulative sum of W: S(i) = W(1)+ . . . +W(i).

(4) Record the maximum of S.

For all permutation of the list of genes, the last element in S will be
zero. To approximate how improbable is the null hypothesis that the two
groups are ordered randomly in the list, the maximal value of S was
compared with the maximal value distribution of T permuted lists. The
one sided P-value of the null hypothesis is the fraction of permutations
with maximal values equal to or greater than the maximum of the
real list.

Hypergeometric distribution. Although the rank test produces a good
visualization of how the genes are sorted by participation, the P—value
retrieved from the maximum of S represents a peak that does not neces-
sarily occur at the beginning of the list. To show that the top of the list
sorted by participation is enriched with genes that are related to cell
differentiation, we use a threshold that separates the beginning of the
list from the rest of the list and compute the fraction of nodes belonging
to the group within the upper part of the list. This number is expected to
be distributed following a hypergeometric distribution. The threshold
that was used here is the top 15% of the list of the genes.

Spearman correlation and Mann—Whitney test. When comparing differ-
ent scores for the list of genes, a Spearman correlation was used, and
when comparing the average score of genes belonging to different sets, a
Mann—Whitney test was performed. Non-parametric tests were used, as
the distribution of scores was not a normal distribution.

Fraction of differentiation genes—Enrichment test. In each of the pre-
viously presented statistical methods, it was assumed that the correlation
among the genes is negligible. This may lead to an overestimate of the
signiﬁcance of the results. To test the signiﬁcance of the correlation in a
different way, we computed the fraction of genes with a G0 annotation
related to differentiation out of all the genes found in the sufﬁcient
RSCCs of the conversion. Clearly the conversions are independent ob-
servations. The population of scores was compared with the fraction of
genes related to differentiation out of the entire network. We then per-
formed a one-sample t-test.

2.5 Control networks

To measure the dependence of the algorithm to generic properties of the
HN, two types of control networks were examined.

0 The ﬁrst type of networks was produced to maintain the in-degree
and out-degree of each node. This type of networks was produced by
permuting the edges of the HN by switching between pairs of edges
(i,j) and (k,l) and replacing them by (i,l) and (k,j). In a rewired HN,
each gene has the same number of activators and inhibitors as in the
HN. We validated that the resulting graph is one large strongly con-
nected component like the HN.

Ten such ‘rewired-HNs’ were created. Each of the 10 represents a
different family of Boolean networks. For each of the 10 ‘rewired-
HNs’, the routine performed for the HN in Section 2.2.6 was performed
as well, i.e. Boolean networks consistent with their wiring and signs were

created and its genes were scored according to their participation in the
conversions. Then the list of genes was sorted according to the mean
score the gene had in the different 10 ‘rewired-HNs’.

o Signed scrambled networks were produced by randomly switching
the signs of the edges, while keeping the edges themselves. The frac-
tion of activating and inhibiting edges was maintained. Clearly, this
control network is more similar to the HN. Similarly, 10 such ‘signed
scrambled-HNs’ were created, and the routine performed for the HN
in Section 2.2.6 was performed as well for each of the 10 families of
networks. Finally, the list of genes was sorted according to the mean
score the gene had in the different 10 ‘signed scrambled-HNs’.

3 RESULTS

We created Boolean networks consistent with the HN by choos-
ing, randomly for each gene, a Boolean function consistent with
the activators and repressors it has according to the Cui et al.
(2007) network. For each network, we checked whether a con-
version between two random cycles could occur. The conversion
is a model of differentiation-like events in random Boolean net-
works (Bodaker et al., 2013). We investigated these simulated
differentiation-like events using a set of signaling nodes. Simply
stated, a conversion in this context is the transfer of a Boolean
network from one attractor to another following signaling from
neighboring cells. To determine which genes (nodes in the net-
work) are the most critical for the conversion, a multistep process
was performed. First, genes that behave similarly in the two
cycles were eliminated (see Section 2). Then we chose within
these genes those that could induce a cycle conversion. Among
those, we removed the genes residing in loops that do not affect
the conversion as explained in Section 2. We computed how
often each gene belongs to the resulting set of converting genes
in these simulations.

The result of this process is a list of genes ordered by the
fraction of simulations where each gene is predicted to partici-
pate in signaling that induces cell conversion. This list is referred
to as the GSL. If our assumption that conversion is related to the
network structure and if our algorithm is correct, we expect the
result of this purely theoretical argument to be correlated with
the experimental observations of differentiations. To show that
this is the case, we analyzed the order of the genes in the GSL.

Among the genes at the top 5% of the GSL are IL4R (inter-
leukin 4 receptor), Mitogen—activated protein/extracellular
signal-regulated kinase 1 (MEKl), extracellular signal-regulated
kinase 2 (ERK2), epidermal growth factor receptor (EGF R) and
(nuclear factor kappa-light-chain—enhancer of activated B cells
(NF -kB). These genes play key roles in known important differ-
entiation processes. IL4R is a type I cytokine receptor, that by
binding to interleukin 4 promotes the differentiation of T cells to
Th2 cells (Nelms et al., 1999). MEKl and ERK2 are involved in
several differentiation processes including neuronal differenti-
ation (Pang et al., 1995). The EGF R is a cell surface receptor
for members of the epidermal growth factor family. It is involved
in many differentiation processes (Herbst, 2004). NF-kB is a
protein complex that controls the transcription of DNA. NF -
kB is known not only for activating B cells (Liou et al., 1994)
but also for osteogenic differentiation (Cho et al., 2009). The top
5% of the GSL is found in Table 1. The full GSL is given in
Supplementary Section S8.

Note: The full list is given in Supplementary Section S8. We have used multiple
methods to determine whether a gene is related to differentiation. The second
colunm represents genes with published literature describing them as linked to dif-
ferentiation (see column 5 for typical reference). The third column represents genes
with a G0 annotation related to differentiation and the fourth column represents
genes related to differentiation using the Categorizer automatic GO hierarchy ana-
lyzer (http: //www.animalgenome.org/tools/catego/).

The top ranking genes are not the only ones related to differ-
entiation. Actually, a clear correlation between the order of genes
in the list and the deﬁnitions of genes related to differentiation
based on their GO classiﬁcation can be found throughout the list.

We compared the order of genes obtained from the algorithm
with genes associated with differentiation using the GO annota-
tion (see Section 2), using four statistical tests. According to the
GO-based gene classiﬁcation, 25% of the studied genes are asso-
ciated with cellular differentiation. However, when scoring the
genes according to the fraction of time they participate in differ-
entiation in the theoretical model (which will be denoted the
sorted list hitherto), 43% of the top 15% of the list are related
to differentiation (P = 0.0006) (Table 2). The results are not sen-
sitive to the cutoff, and a 10/20% cutoff led to P=0.006 and
P: 0.002, respectively. Similarly, throughout the entire list,
genes associated with differentiation have higher scores
(P:0.005 for the Mann—Whitney test and P=0.0011 for the
gene rank test) (Fig. 1 and Table 2).

The P—values of these tests can be affected by correlation be-
tween neighboring genes in the network. We thus used an extra
test, the enrichment test, which avoids such biases. We computed
for each conversion the fraction of nodes with G0 annotations
related to differentiation out of the nodes in the sufﬁcient RSCCs

3.1 Effect of degree, centrality and signs

The relation between the network-based gene classiﬁcation and
the independent GO clearly shows that the genes found by our
algorithm are highly correlated with differentiation. The pro-
posed seemingly theoretical approach actually detects features
inherent to stem cell differentiation, and that these features are
correlated with properties of the network. The conversion test
that we have developed can be determined by complex properties
of the network, which are affected by the speciﬁc dynamics of the
random Boolean network, or it can be based on generic proper-
ties such as the degree (The degree of a gene is the number of
genes that regulate it plus the number of genes that it regulates.)

or the betweenness centrality (The betweenness centrality of a
gene is the number of shortest paths from all genes to all others
that pass through that gene.).

We checked for the Spearman correlation between the scores
of the different genes to their degree and to their centrality
(Table 3). A strong correlation exists between the degree and
centrality and the UQC participation frequency. To show that
the network as an ensemble determines the RSCCs and differen-
tiation and not only the generic properties mentioned earlier in
the text, we repeated the statistical tests for the lists of genes
sorted according to their degree and centrality (two different
lists) and saw that although the degree and centrality are
linked to cellular differentiation (or vice versa), their correlation
is much weaker than the full algorithm (Table 2).

To classify more precisely the elements correlating the network
properties and the experimentally observed differentiation, we
produced artiﬁcial networks that contain some of the properties
of the real network (denoted as control networks). We checked
the relation between the order in the GSL in the real HN net-
work and in the control networks. We have produced control
networks for the degree and for the effect of the edges signs
(activation or inhibition). In each case, 10 networks were created
(see Section 2). For each network, the algorithm scored the genes
and set a mean score to each gene from these control networks.
We checked for the Spearman correlation between the scores of
the different genes to the mean scores obtained from the control
networks (Table 3). A correlation exists between the scores in the
sorted list and in the control networks, and these correlations are
higher than the ones obtained for the degree and centrality.
Again, when using the enrichment test, there is no enrichment
in the fraction of nodes with differentiation GO annotations in
cycles inducing differentiation in the control networks.

To summarize, a clear order emerges in the correlation of the
theoretical predictions with the GO annotations. The highest
correlation is with the real network, followed by the same net-
work with random signs, which itself is followed by a rando-
mized network where edges are swapped, and ﬁnally a
classiﬁcation based on the degree and centrality. This is in
good agreement with the correlation in the order between the
different lists of genes.

3.2 Comparison to other processes

A possible explanation for the correlation between UQC and
differentiation is that genes in essential parts of the networks
tend to induce UQC, rather than genes speciﬁc for

differentiation. To show that this is not the case, we have com-
pared the rank test for differentiation with a related set of GO
annotations of development and with a non-related set of GO
annotations of nucleic acid metabolism, based on the
CateGOrizer tool (Fig. 2). The G0 annotations related to nucleic
acid metabolism have a limited negative correlation with a P-
value of 0.0445 (derived from the rank test). Thus, choosing any
crucial intracellular processes would not lead to similar results.

3.3 Correlation between participation in UQC and
subcellular locations

There is an interesting potential correlation between the partici-
pation in the sufﬁcient RSCC and the subcellular localization of
the gene products. The cellular localization of the gene products
was compared with their frequency in conversions. We only
looked at the main subcellular locations: extracellular, plasma
membrane, cytoplasm, nucleus and mitochondria (Fig. 3 and
Table 4). Associating a gene to a subcellular location was per-
formed using the GO annotations and the CateGOrizer tool.

Note: Rank test P-values one and two represent positive and negative correlations,
respectively (measured with a rank test). The last column is the P-value of a two-
sided Mann—Whitney test for order in the list between positive and negative genes.

Table 4 indicates that apart from the nucleus, all the subcel-
lular locations are positively correlated (cytoplasm and mito-
chondria) or negatively correlated (plasma membrane and
extracellular) with participation in conversions.

The positive correlation observed for mitochondria seems
strange at ﬁrst sight. However, all the 27 genes that have GO
annotations associated with the mitochondria also have GO an-
notations associated with the cytoplasm, indicating they are not
the standard mitochondrial genes. One possibility is that they are
related to apoptosis caused by external signals, and 14 of the 27
genes have GO annotations related to apoptosis. Apoptosis is
known to take place in mammalian morphogenesis to eliminate
cells during organogenesis, a process which occurs parallel to
differentiation (Mori et al., 1995).

Along the same lines, a somewhat unexpected negative correl-
ation was observed for extracellular proteins, which may act as
signals, and for plasma membrane proteins, which may act as
receptors. However, most gene products that participate in the
conversion are neither extracellular signals nor membrane-bound
receptors, but instead, are mostly cytoplasmic. This demonstrates
that the genes detected by the UQC algorithm belong to the core
genetic network rather than to signals that converge to operate it.

3.4 Edges participation in UQC and emerging subgraph
The sufﬁcient RSCCs contain not only genes but the edges be-
tween them as well. Each edge has a score reﬂecting the number
of times it participated in the sufﬁcient RSCCs. It is interesting to
check among the genes that participate frequently in the sufﬁ-
cient RSCCs what is the emerging subgraph when only edges
with high scores are included.

The mean score of the genes included in the sufﬁcient RSCCs
is 0.1496:I:0.0441. The mean score of the number of times an
edge participated in sufﬁcient RSCCs is 0.1119:I: 0.0316.
A threshold of one mean plus one standard deviation was used
for genes, and a threshold of one mean plus one and a half
standard deviations was used for the edges, to limit the
number of edges. In the emerging subgraph, there are 14 CCs
(connected components) and only four small SCCs each of which
includes two genes. With the exception of one, all the CCs are
small and do not contain a long pathway. The large CC is pre-
sented in Figure 4 (the smaller CCs are not shown).

In Supplementary Section S9, the genes of the largest CC are
presented with a short description. This large component is

Fig. 4. Largest CC of the emerged subgraph. The sufﬁcient RSCCs con-
tain not only genes but the edges between them as well. Each edge has a
score reﬂecting the number of times it participated in the sufﬁcient
RSCCs. The emerged subgraph contains only genes and edges that par-
ticipated frequently in conversions. Only one large CC (connect compo-
nent) was found. In Supplementary Section S9, the genes of the largest
CC are presented with a short description

composed mainly of mid-degree genes showing again that the
degree is not the main element driving the participation in
UQC (see second column in Supplementary Table S9). The path-
way inside the largest CC begins with genes that are related to
apoptosis induction by external signals and continues with genes
affecting the differentiation of cells in the hematopoietic system.
These genes, known to affect the differentiation of cells in the
hematopoietic system, not only have a mid-degree, but they also
have a low centrality (the mean of degree is ~7 and the mean of
centrality is ~1710). This pathway is one of the most active
pathways for cell differentiation in adults. It naturally emerges
from the participation frequency in UQC. In other words, the
only connected subnetwork purely composed of interactions
highly connected to UQC is in the core of the adult hematopoi-
etic cell differentiation, suggesting again that differentiation is
actually a global property of the genes associated with it and
not purely deﬁned by the biochemical properties of the genes.

4 DISCUSSION

The relation between a speciﬁc pathway and differentiation can
be the result of the speciﬁc interactions in these pathways, and
detailed molecular aspects of the component of this pathway, or
this relation may be the result of the position of the pathway in a
larger network. Although the two explanations are not contra-
dictory, the ﬁrst one has been classically highlighted. Here, we
have used a novel approach to test the second hypothesis. We
asked whether the properties of the gene regulatory network
affect the genes and their products that are associated with cell
differentiation.

We have shown that our methodology that was developed as a
theoretical model of random Boolean networks can provide an
educated guideline for the detection of genes experimentally
observed to participate in cell differentiation events in humans,
although the algorithm was never trained on gene classiﬁcation
from experimental data. Using non-parametric statistics (rank
test), we have demonstrated that the correlation between the
genes that participated in the conversions of the simulations
(using our algorithms) to those actually known to date to be
involved in cellular differentiation in human cells is statistically
signiﬁcant. We further validated that these results are not exclu-
sively affected by the existing correlation between the participa-
tion of genes in conversions and their degree; by using rewired
networks as a control, we have shown that the effect of degree is
limited. This conﬁrms that the seemingly theoretical approach
actually uncovers features in the gene regulatory network that
are inherent to stem cell differentiation. We have also tested for a
possibility that our results are simply induced by the centrality
(which is highly correlated with both the degree and our score),
but again the centrality is much less correlated with the GO
classiﬁcation than our score. We did ﬁnd, however, that the
signs of the edges are almost meaningless, implying that the
observed sign of the regulation is too partial to lead to useful
conclusions at least in the current context. The absence of a sign
effect may be the result of a more inherent structure of the net-
work. A basic concept in Boolean networks introduced by
Kauffman is the core of the network (Kauffman, 1993). The
network’s core is the set of nodes found ﬁxed on the same
Boolean values in all of the network’s cycles. Kauffman studied
the emergence of the core and supplied sufﬁcient mathematical
theory for its formation. However, there is no good way to esti-
mate a priori the dynamics of nodes not found in the core. In the
conversions studied here, the nodes change their character be-
tween the two cycles and hence are not supposed to be a part of
the core. However, we did ﬁnd nodes in the sufﬁcient RSCCs
that according to Kauffman were supposed to be a part of the
core. Moreover, in the sufﬁcient RSCCs, we found nodes not
ﬁxed in both of the cycles although the conversions are not de-
pendent on the initial steps of the cycles. Thus, the structural
element shaping the dynamics of cycles in Boolean networks
may extend well beyond the standard deﬁnition of the core.
One aspect of this modeling may explain why sign-scrambling
the edges does not drastically affect the sufﬁcient RSCCs. This
may happen, as changing the signs may compensate and preserve
a similar core and perhaps even similar sufﬁcient RSCCs. A de-
tailed analysis of the structures beyond the network core will be
given in a future work.

The algorithm not only detects genes but also detects the edges
between them (interaction between genes tightly linked to differ-
entiation). We built a subgraph from the genes and edges that
frequently participated in conversions. The only long pathway
detected was found to be one of the most active pathways in
differentiation processes of the adult human, affecting the differ-
entiation of cells in the hematopoietic system. This long pathway
is composed mainly of mid-degree genes showing again that the
degree is not at all the main element driving the participation in
conversions. To the best of our knowledge, this work is the ﬁrst
to predict genes that are related to differentiation based only on a
gene regulatory network. The presented methodology can be

applied to create a novel bioinformatics tool for gene classiﬁca-
tion and can also assist experimental biologists that wish to
induce differentiation to cells in vitro and in vivo.

An important result from our previous theoretical work
(Bodaker et al., 2013) is that conversions are mostly reversible.
Unlike the process of iPSCs (induced pluripotent stem cells),
where fully differentiated cells become pluripotent by the ectopic
expression of key transcription factors (Takahashi et al., 2007;
Takahashi and Yamanaka, 2006), we suggested (Bodaker et al.,
2013) that differentiated cells can be used as precursor cells to the
tissue stem cells from which they originated by overexpressing
relevant genes’ products. The presented methodology can be
applied to assist experimental biologists that wish to attempt
such a process.

Boolean networks were initially developed to study theoretical
concepts such as the number of possible attractors in a random
network or their properties (Harris et al., 2002; Kauffman et al.,
2003, 2004). Here, we have shown that these networks can have
direct practical application for the classiﬁcation of genes. This is
the ﬁrst time that such applications are presented for a concept
that was considered purely theoretical. We have shown that by
pure mathematical analysis of well-curated gene networks, we
can predict the genes that are associated with differentiation.
The algorithms that we have developed will become more and
more useful as the gene networks will grow and expand in the
future.

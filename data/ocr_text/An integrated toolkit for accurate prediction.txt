ABSTRACT

Motivation: We present an integrated toolkit, BoBro2.0, for prediction
and analysis of cis-regulatory motifs. This toolkit can (i) reliably identify
statistically significant cis-regulatory motifs at a genome scale; (ii) ac-
curately scan for all motif instances of a query motif in specified gen-
omic regions using a novel method for P—value estimation; (iii) provide
highly reliable comparisons and clustering of identified motifs, which
takes into consideration the weak signals from the flanking regions of
the motifs; and (iv) analyze co-occurring motifs in the regulatory
regions.

Results: We have carried out systematic comparisons between motif
predictions using BoBro2.0 and the MEME package. The comparison
results on Escherichia coli K12 genome and the human genome show
that BoBro2.0 can identify the statistically significant motifs at a
genome scale more efficiently, identify motif instances more accur-
ately and get more reliable motif clusters than MEME. In addition,
BoBro2.0 provides correlational analyses among the identified motifs
to facilitate the inference of joint regulation relationships of transcrip-
tion factors.

1 INTRODUCTION

Computational identiﬁcation of conserved cis—regulatory motifs
represents an important problem in computational genomics,
and it can provide a key piece of information for inference of
gene regulation networks (Brohee et al., 2011; Davidson and
Levin, 2005). In the past three decades, numerous tools have
been developed to ﬁnd cis—regulatory motifs in the promoter re-
gions of given genes (Chen et al., 2008; Das and Dai, 2007; Li
et al., 2011; Sinha, 2007), and have been successfully applied to
several organisms to generate large-scale regulatory networks

(Baumbach, 2010; Brohee et al., 2011). In addition, two related
problems are also of great interest: (i) motif scanning for add-
itional motif instances across a genome based on known or pre-
dicted motifs, which needs a reliable measurement for the
statistical signiﬁcance of the scanned motif instances; and high
false-positive prediction rates are the main issue with the existing
prediction tools; and (ii) reliability assessment of the predicted
motifs against annotated motifs in motif databases, which re-
quires an effective way to compare the predicted motifs with
the documented cis—regulatory motifs in the published literature
and databases. A number of software packages have been de-
veloped to deal with such issues (Bailey et al., 2009; Thomas-
Chollier et al., 2008). For example, the MEME package (Bailey
et al., 2009) was originally developed to identify conserved motifs
(Bailey and Elkan, 1994), and now consists of a number of ana-
lysis capabilities, such as FIMO (Tanaka et al., 2011) and MAST
(Bailey and Gribskov, 1998) for motif scanning and TOMTOM
(Tanaka et al., 2011) for motif comparison. These additional
capabilities have substantially extended the utility of the
MEME program.

Although substantial efforts have been invested to study these
motif-related problems since the mid-80s, they are still largely
unsolved, especially for genome-scale applications (Das and
Dai, 2007; Stormo, 2000; Tompa et al., 2005). A number of
challenging issues persist and await for better solutions, including
(i) more effective ways for reliably assessing the statistical signiﬁ-
cance of the predicted motifs (Tompa et al., 2005), hence possibly
overcoming the high false-positive rate issue; (ii) improved cap-
abilities for evaluating predicted motif instances to decrease the
false-positive rates in motif scanning (da Fonseca et al., 2008;
Medina-Rivera et al., 2011); and (iii) improved similarity meas-
ures between two motifs, which currently suffer from the inabil-
ity to effectively deal with sequence variations in motifs, hence
leading to low prediction sensitivities (Tanaka et al., 2011).

We have recently developed an improved version of our pre-
vious tool BoBro (Li et al., 2011), BoBro2.0, to address some of
these issues (see Fig. 1 for the ﬂowchart of BoBro2.0). Compared
with BoBro, the new toolkit has a number of novel capabilities (i)
motif reﬁnement and evaluation based on information extracted
from the entire genome and a phylogenetic footprinting method,
(ii) motif scanning based on a global P—value estimation method,
(iii) motif comparison and clustering using a novel and effective

latory regions. The capability of (i) can make the predicted
motifs not only statistically signiﬁcant but also biologically
meaningful; the one in (ii) can improve motif-scanning perform-
ance in both the prediction precision and recall. The motif com-
parison and clustering function in (iii) can identify more reliable
motif clusters for a given transcription factor (TF), and the co-
occurring motif analysis in (iv) can provide useful information
about joint regulations among TFs. We have assessed the per-
formance of BoBro2.0 in comparison with MEME and asso-
ciated analysis tools on large test sets spanning genomic
sequences of E.coli K12 and human, and found that our program
consistently performed better than those programs.

2 METHODS

BoBro2.0 represents an integrated toolkit for motif identiﬁcation and
analysis, including capabilities for BoBro-based motif Reﬁnement tool
(BBR), BoBro-based motif Scanning tool (BBS), BoBro-based motif
Comparison and Clustering tool (BBC) and BoBro-based motif correla-
tion Analysis tool (BBA). Table 1 summarizes the key features of each of
these components, and details about applications and references are avail-
able in the Supplementary Material. Generally, a regulatory motif can be
represented by different models, e.g. consensus (Schneider, 2002),
position weight matrix (PWM) (Ben-Gal et al., 2005) or hidden
Markov model (Baum, 1970), which are all based on aligned motif bind-
ing sites. Hence, in the following, we use motif to represent a set of aligned
similar binding sites (documented or predicted), and use instance or motif
instance to represent each individual site of the motif.

2.1 BBR: a method for filtering out noises among
predicted motifs at a genome scale

Consider a genome-scale motif prediction problem: denote all the motifs
predicted by a de-novo motif ﬁnding tool as S2; R and C represent the
given set of regulatory sequences for motif identiﬁcation and a control
sequence set, respectively. For any motif m 6 S2, it is considered as a
motif if it satisﬁes the following three criteria: (i) the P-value of m with
respect to a hypothesis that it appears in R by chance is below a speciﬁed
cutoff value; (ii) R is more enriched of the instances of m than C, as
deﬁned in formula (1); and (iii) m is well-conserved across a diverse set
of species, as deﬁned in formula (2).

Criterion (i) is measured using the P-value deﬁned in our previous
work (Li et al., 2011). Speciﬁcally, let x be a random variable denoting
the number of instances of a motif in a given set of regulatory sequences,
and its probability distribution, p(x), can be approximated using a
Poisson distribution. Hence, the P-value of a motif can be calculated
by summing up the probability of p(x) over x Z k, denoting that the
motif has at least k instances. An enrichment score is deﬁned to evaluate
the statistical signiﬁcance of the ratio between the number of m’s
instances in R and that in C, as given in the following,

Z 2 NR — (IRI*Nc)/ICI (1)
x/(|R|*Nc)/|C|
where N R and NC are the numbers of instances of m in R and C, respect-
ively; and |R| and |C| are the sequence lengths of R and C, respectively.
Criterion (iii) is deﬁned in terms of the average enrichment score deﬁned
in formula (2), with each Z term being deﬁned in (l) for each organism
over a set of diverse species and the original genome.

22.- (2)

ieG,

Z:

where G, represents a set of species and Z,- is m’s enrichment score in
species i, i6 G,. We consider a motif as statistically signiﬁcant if its
P< 3.3e-5 (the P-value threshold has been corrected for multiple testing
based on the estimated number, 300, of TFs in E.coli). Criteria (ii) and
(iii) are designed to ensure that predicted motifs will be as biologically
meaningful as possible (Bailey, 2011).

2.2 BBS: scanning and ranking new instances of a query
motif based on P—values

A key to reliable motif-scanning at a genome scale is an ability to effect-
ively evaluate the similarity between a motif instance and a query motif
(Das and Dai, 2007; Haverty and Weng, 2004; Medina-Rivera et al.,
2011; Thomas-Chollier et al., 2008). Obviously, different similarity cutoffs
may result in different scanning results. BBS provides a global P-value for
the entire motif instances for each motif scan. We ﬁrst introduce a few
deﬁnitions; let M be an aligned query motif of L nucleotides long and its
PWM WM is deﬁned as a 4-by-L matrix, given in (3):

Pij

WM — (10gE>4XL 
where pi]- is the probability of nucleotide i e {A, C, G, T} appearing at
position j in M; and q,- is the probability of i appearing in the background
sequences, e.g. all the promoter sequences in the entire genome.
Comparing with the traditional PWM model that assumes independence
among different sequence positions, we assumed ﬁrst-order Markov-
chain property among consecutive sequence positions in our model.
We generated a transition matrixWM, with WM(i, i’ , j) representing the
probability of a speciﬁc nucleotide type i followed by a speciﬁc nucleotide
type i’ in consecutive positions j and j+ 1 of the query motif (see
Supplementary Material for details). The similarity between a motif in-
stance b = i1, i2, ..., iL i]- e {A, C, G, T} and a query motifM is measured
us1ng:

L L—l
SM(b; WM, WM) = Z WMo'J-J) + 2 W140), gm) (4)
1:1 j=l

Consider a motif M’ with t instances{a1, a2, ..., at}, the average similarity
AS(M’, M) between M’ and M is measured using the following:

1 l
AS(MI, M) = 7 E SM(a,-; WM,  
i=0

A 2. closure of M, denoted as S2(M, 2.), is a set of sequence segments in the
input regulatory sequences, each having a similarity score no less than

2*AS(M’, M). Our previous experience has been that the documented cis-
regulatory motifs tend to have signiﬁcantly more instances with high
similarities among them than the accidental ones, and the size of a 2
closure provides a good measure for this (Li et al., 2011). The P-value
p(M, 2) of S2(M, 2) can be approximated using a Poisson distribution
based on our previous work (Li et al., 2011). We can select a 2 value
2 M so that the 2 closure of M can give the best motif prediction perform-
ance measured in terms of prediction sensitivity and speciﬁcity. One way
to accomplish this is through ﬁnding a 2 M that minimizes the following
function:

p(M,2.M) = min p(M, 2) (6)
0<2<1

This capability can be used to derive an optimal similarity cut-off for
motif scanning on a statistically sound basis.

2.3 BBC: motif comparison and clustering

Utilization of weak conserved signals of motifs’ ﬂanking regions in
motif comparison: We have observed that the ﬂanking regions of
cis—regulatory motifs tend to have some level of sequence conservation,
and we have developed the following procedure to take advantage
of this information in motif comparison. Deﬁne a deformation of
information content (Schneider et al., 1986) for a motif M of length
L as follows:

2
Z FM(i,j)*PM(i,j)) (7)

ie{A, C, G, T}

L
DIC(M) = Z <

1:1

where F M = (pg-)4“ and the other items are the same as in formula
(3). Consider two motifs M1 and M2 with lengths L1 and L2, respect-
ively, and L=min {L1, L2}. Let M1’ and M2’ be the two extended
motifs formed by concatenating the L1/2 and L2/2 nucleotides on
each side of each motif instance sequence of M1 and M2, respectively
(If the location information of given motifs in their original genome is
available, we can use the ﬂanking region of each motif to generate the
extended motif sequence); hence, their lengths are 2L1 and 2L2. The
similarity between the extended instances of M1 and M2 is deﬁned as
follows:

DICpJ/(M/i) 1‘ DICpJ/(M/z)

S M ,M = max
( 1 2) 05p5L1,0:q:L2 DIC(M1)+DIC(M2)

Supplementary Figure Sl shows an example of motif comparison using
this measure, which illustrates the idea of this measure using the infor-
mation from the motif ﬂanking regions.

Motif clustering using the new similarity measure: A group of motifs can
be clustered into subgroups of similar motifs using the following algo-
rithm, which is based on a maximum spanning tree (MST) representation
of the candidate motifs. First, consider a complete graph deﬁned over a
list of candidate motifs, each represented as a node and each pair of
motifs connected by an edge; the weight of an edge is the similarity be-
tween the two corresponding motifs (see Fig. 2a). An MST of the graph is
constructed using Kruskal’s algorithm (Thomas, 2001). We have clus-
tered the predicted motifs based on two different similarity thresholds,
T1 and T 2, giving rise to two classes of motif clusters, namely, highly
reliable and relatively reliable motif clusters, respectively. We have com-
pared each pair of documented motifs in the RegulonDB database
(Salgado et al., 2013) and assigned the median and the upper quartile
of all the similarities to T1 and T 2, respectively. Each of the two thresh-
olds is used to remove edges with similarities lower than the threshold,
giving rise to the ﬁnal list of motif clusters (see Fig. 2) represented as a
connected sub-tree of the MST after application of the threshold. Then,
all instances of each motif cluster are mapped back to the original regu-
latory sequences, facilitating further analysis and interpretation of the
motif-prediction results (Supplementary Fig. S2).

2.4 BBA: motif co-occurrence analysis

We have implemented a function BBA to evaluate the co-occurrences
among the identiﬁed motifs in a given set of regulatory sequences,
which can reveal joint regulation relationships by multiple TFs. For a
given motif pair a and b, and the entire set of promoter sequences P, let A
and B be the subsets of P that contain motif instances of a and b, re-
spectively (we assume, without loss of generality, |A| 5 |B|). Let
k: |A ﬂBl, then the probability of A and B sharing k promoter se-
quences can be calculated using the following hyper-geometric function:

Prp(k|P, A, B) = W (9)
(12)

The P-value of a and b co-occurring in the same regulatory regions is
calculated as the probability of A and B sharing at least k regulatory
sequences. For a pair of motifs, a signiﬁcant P-value means their in-
stances tend to occur in same regulatory sequences, hence indicating
that their corresponding TFs may co-regulate the same genes with high
probability.

2.5 Data preparation

To test the motif-ﬁnding performance of BoBro2.0, we have collected
2462 promoter sequences (also referred to as regulatory sequences),
each being 300 bps long, covering all the predicted operons in E.coli
K12, which were retrieved from the DOOR database (Dam et al.,
2007; Mao et al., 2009). Two hundred sixteen bacterial genomes within
the same phylum but in different genre of E.coli were collected from the
NCBI (2011-11-01). In each genus, we selected the largest genome to
avoid potential selection bias in comparative genomic studies (Che
et al., 2006). In addition for the motif scanning assessment, we have
collected all the known cis—regulatory motifs of E.coli K12 from the
RegulonDB database (Salgado et al., 2013), which has the PWM matrices

dependent motif clusters {1} and {2} using the threshold T2, reﬂecting
that the similarity between motifs 1 and 2 are lower than that between
motifs 5 and 6

for 52 TFs of E.coli K12. Of these TFs, we removed 17 whose cis-regu-
latory motifs are known to be not conserved according to a study by
Medina-Rivera et al. (2011) and four additional ones that have been
reported as nucleoid-associated proteins whose cis motifs are known to
be not conserved, which leaves 31 TFs. In addition to E.coli K12, we also
collected 1460 human cis-regulatory motifs from Xie et al. (2005).
Further, we retrieved the detailed information of eight global TFs from
RegulonDB, representing the eight largest regulons in the database,
namely, CRP, FNR, Fur, LexA, IHF, GntR, PhoP and UlaR, to
assess the performance of motif comparison methods.

3 RESULTS

Here we compare BoBro2.0 with the latest version of the MEME
suite, a most popular motif-ﬁnding and analysis package, in
terms of their performance on both prokaryotic and eukaryotic
genomes. We found that (i) the predicted motifs by BoBro2.0
have better motif-matching scores and regulon coverage scores
(RCSs) than those by MEME; (ii) the average F—score of BBS
(0.32) on 31 E.coli motifs is signiﬁcantly higher than that of
FIMO (0.14); similar performance results are found in 1460
human cis-regulatory motifs (0.34 versus 0.15); (iii) BBC
can identify more accurate motif clusters than TOMTOM in a
constructed motif database; and (iv) BBA can identify jointly
regulating TFs, which are supported by the published literature.
The computational complexity, the actual computing time and
selected parameters of each used program can be found in
Supplementary Table S1.

3.1 BOBr02.0 can identify cis-regulatory motifs at a
genome scale reliably and efﬁciently

To assess the motif-ﬁnding performance of our toolkit, we have
systematically compared BoBro2.0 with MEME on the entire
E.coli K12 genome. For each program, we take the top 100
predicted motifs as the predictions (the parameters of each pro-
gram can be found in Supplementary Table S1). First, we note
that BoBro is much faster than MEME, as it took 2181 min in
comparison with 4492 min by MEME to generate the top 100
motifs for the promoter sequences in E.coli K12 (both BoBro
and MEME are implemented on a computer with 264GB
memory and CPU E5-2630 0 @ 2.3GHz). To highlight the

performance of our motif reﬁnement tool, BBR, we have applied
it to the motif predictions by both BoBro and MEME, denoted
as BoBro+BBR and MEME+BBR, respectively (see Suppleme-
ntary Appendix 1 for details).

We then compared the motif prediction performance of
the four programs, MEME, MEME+BBR, BoBro and
BoBro+BBR, in terms of the motif-matching score (MMS),
deﬁned as follows:

’ER IrgI/N

where Mg represents the set of genes in the immediate down-
stream operon of motif M; rg represents the set of genes in
regulon r; the set of all the regulons encoded in E.coli K12 is
denoted as R; and N is the number of genes in the E.coli K12
genome. The MMS can be used to infer whether a predicted
motif is involved in the regulation of a speciﬁc regulon. From
the comparison results in Figure 3, we noted that through top 10
to top 100, (i) the MMSs of the predicted motif by BoBro are
signiﬁcantly higher than that by MEME, and (ii) the MM Ss of
the reﬁned motifs by BoBro—I—BBR and MEME—I—BBR are higher
than predicted motifs by BoBro and MEME, in most cases, re-
spectively. The consensus and enrichment scores for each pre-
dicted motif by BoBro and by MEME are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.

In addition, we deﬁne RCS for each regulon r as

(U;1  ﬂ rgD / |rg| to measure the coverage of individual op-

erons of a regulon predicted by a prediction program versus the
known component operons of the regulon, where 11420 g i g T)
denotes the predicted gene sets by a program (T: 10, 20,. . .,
100). Note that the larger the RC5, the more component genes
of the corresponding regulon are correctly covered by the pre-
diction program. Figure 4 shows a comparison among the RC5
values by the four programs on the 12 largest regulons: CRP,
Fur, FNR, IHF, Fis, Lrp, CpxR, LexA, NsrR, NarL, Cra and

ArcA, each containing at least 20 operons. It is clear that (i) the
prediction coverage by BoBro is considerably higher than that by
MEME, and (ii) our reﬁnement tool, BBR, can improve the
RCSs of predicted motifs by both BoBro and MEME (see details
in Supplementary Table S3).

One of the issues that have troubled the motif-ﬁnding pro-
grams is how to effectively distinguish between cis-regulatory
motifs and the so-called bacterial-interspersed mosaic elements
(Bachellier et al., 1999), also known as repetitive extra-genic pal-
indrome elements (Bachellier et al., 1999; Keseler et al., 2011),
which are conserved palindromic sequences with various se-
quence lengths, mostly in the intergenic regions. For example,
‘CTTATCCGGCCTACAAA’ is a key repetitive extra-genic pal-
indrome pattern in E.coli K12. BoBro2.0 can effectively identify
such elements when searching for cis-regulatory motifs through
the designed criteria embedded in BBR (see details in Methods
section), and ﬁlter some of them out, although overall the prob-
lem remains an unsolved one.

3.2 BBS can identify motif instances more accurately than
FIMO

The BBS provides a global P—value for the entire motif prediction
when scanning for motif instances at a genome scale, which pro-
vides a reliable way for automatically selecting an optimal
sequence-similarity threshold for global motif scanning. Our re-
sults show that BBS can signiﬁcantly improve the motif-scanning
performance in both E.coli K12 and human genomes compared
with the FIMO program in MEME. The test set consists of 31
conserved motifs from RegulonDB (see Section 2.5 for details).
We used an F—score to measure the prediction accuracy (van
Rijsbergen, 1979), which is the harmonic mean of precision and
recall,

where precision represents the fraction of the predicted motif
instances that are documented TF binding sites (Salgado et al.,
2013; Xie et al., 2005), and recall is the fraction of the docu-
mented TF binding sites that are predicted. Figure 5a shows
that the F—scores on the 31 TFs by BBS are signiﬁcantly higher
than those by FIMO (see Supplementary Table S4 for details).
In addition, we have also applied BBS to 1 460 regulatory motifs
of the human genome, extracted from Xie et al. (2005), which are
identiﬁed in promoters and 3’ UTRs by comparative analyses of
the human, mouse, rat and dog genomes. Figure 5b shows a per-
formance comparison on this dataset between BBS and FIMO (see
Supplementary Table S5 for details). It is noteworthy that the
decreased performance by the two programs in comparison with
that on E.coli K12 is probably owing to the higher noise level in the
human genome than a bacterial genome. Also, the documented
motifs representing only a very small fraction of all the encoded
cis-regulatory motifs in the human genome also account for the
decline in the performance statistics. As shown in Figure 5, some
motifs, scanned by BBS and FIMO, have F—scores close to 0 in both
human genome and E.coli K12, for which the real motifs are
known. This is caused by the relatively high false-positive rates
that all motif scanning programs have to overcome. From the
performance statistics, we can see that there is clearly a large
room for improvement in human or other complex eukaryotic gen-
omes, possibly by using additional information and techniques.

3.3 BBC can identify more accurate motif clusters than
TOMTOM

Motif BLAST is a process for identifying statistically signiﬁcant
motifs in a known motif database, which match the given query
motifs. We have compared the performance in this area by
BoBro2.0 and MEME. We have built a motif dataset using the
footprinting technique (Blanchette and Tompa, 2002; Kudla
et al., 2006; Sosinsky et al., 2007) for the assessment purpose
(see Supplementary Material for details). The dataset contains
561 motifs, covering 216 bacterial genomes, for 8 global TFs,
namely, CRP, FNR, Fur, LexA, IHF, GntR, PhoP and UlaR
(see Section 2.5). The motifs of these eight TFs in E.coli K12 are
used as the queries. For any query motif m, we deﬁne the motif
prediction sensitivity as le ﬂ Iml/IIml, where Bm represents all

with a recently published program, TOMTOM (Tanaka et al.,
2011), a program of MEME. Figure 6 shows the comparison
results of the identiﬁcation sensitivity on the eight regulons.
BBC has at least as high sensitivity as TOMTOM.

3.4 BBA can identify TFs that jointly regulate genes

It is known that some genes are jointly regulated by multiple
TFs, and these genes should have the cis-regulatory motifs of
the corresponding TFs, generally arranged in tandem in their
promoter sequences (Madan Babu and Teichmann, 2003). We
have done statistical analysis on each pair of TFs in E.coli K12 to
identify such joint regulations. Speciﬁcally, we infer that a pair of
TFs jointly regulates genes using the motif co-occurrence analysis
on all the documented 159 motifs of E.coli K12 in RegulonDB
(see Methods section). To calibrate the P—value distribution, we
have run BBA on both documented motifs and randomly simu-
lated motifs (see Supplementary Material for details). Figure 7
shows the distribution of the P—values on both the documented
and simulated motifs. We can see that 164 (represented by red
bars in Fig. 7) of all 12 561 pairs of documented motifs have
signiﬁcant P—values (<0.01) to co-occur in the same promoters.
The comparison with the simulated data (represented by green
bars) shows that the P—value threshold is signiﬁcant enough and
the chosen pairs are not random noise. Hence, we predict these
164 pairs of TFs jointly regulate gene transcription in E.coli K12
and 42 of them have full or partial supporting evidence in the
published literature. Table 2 shows the most signiﬁcant 10 TF
pairs, and the full list is given in Supplementary Table S6.

To assess the quality of our predicted TF pairs, we have done an
extensive literature search aiming to ﬁnd published data that may
support our predictions. Among the 164 TF pairs, 42 pairs have
full or partial supporting evidence with the detailed information
given in Supplementary Table S6. We highlight a few examples
here. (i) GalS and GalR are known to jointly regulate the gal
regulon (Geanacopoulos and Adhya, 1997; Weickert and Adhya,
1992); (ii) GadX and GadW are members of the AraC/XylS family
of TFs and they collaboratively regulate glutamate-dependent acid
resistance in E.coli K12 (Gallegos et al., 1997; Ma et al., 2002;

for real data. Motif pairs with P < 0.01 (red bars) are considered as
signiﬁcantly co-occurred

Martin and Rosner, 2001; Tramonti et al., 2008); (iii) FNR and
CRP belong to the CRP/FNR superfamily of TFs whose members
are widely distributed in bacteria, and they have been reported to
co-activate the genes involved in reductive dehalogenation of
chlorinated aromatic compounds (Gabor et al., 2006; Korner
et al., 2003); (iv) IHF and Fis are two nucleoid-associated proteins
in gram-negative bacteria (Dillon and Dorman, 2010), which com-
prise the prereplication complexes to unwind the origin of replica-
tion in E.coli K12 (Ryan et al., 2004); (v) the Cth protein cannot
act alone, and the synergistic DNA binding is increased by direct
interaction with CRP (Sogaard-Andersen, et al., 1990a,b, 1991);
and (vi) IHF and CRP are known to collaborate to regulate the
expression of the tpl promoter and gltBDF operon (Bai and
Somerville, 1998; Paul et al., 2007).

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

Compared with the most popular motif analysis software
MEME, BoBro2.0 has the following unique and strong features,
which all improve the state-of—the—art: it (i) can reliably identify
statistically signiﬁcant cis-regulatory motifs at a genome scale;
(ii) provides a reliable way for optimizing the sequence-similarity
cutoff in genome-scale motif scanning; (iii) has a reliable capabil-
ity to compare and cluster motifs and (iv) can identify TFs that
may jointly regulate genes through identiﬁcation of the co-oc—
currences of their cis-regulatory motifs. With these features, we
expect that BoBro 2.0 provides a useful tool for motif identiﬁ-
cation and analysis complementary to the existing tools.

It is noteworthy that based on the above performance on the
human genome, BoBro2.0 can be realistically applied to eukary-
otic genomes for reliable identiﬁcation of conserved cis-regula-
tory motifs. Speciﬁcally, BBR is designed to improve the
applications of BoBro in eukaryotes. In addition, BBA, which
is more genome-independent, can clearly be applied to eukary-
otes, and we expect that its performance should be about the
same as on prokaryotic genomes.

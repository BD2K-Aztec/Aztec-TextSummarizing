ABSTRACT

Motivation: Coexpression networks are data-derived representations
of genes behaving in a similar way across tissues and experimental
conditions. They have been used for hypothesis generation and
guilt-by-association approaches for inferring functions of previously
unknown genes. So far, the main platform for expression data has
been DNA microarrays; however, the recent development of
RNA-seq allows for higher accuracy and coverage of transcript popu-
lations. It is therefore important to assess the potential for biological
investigation of coexpression networks derived from this novel tech-
nique in a condition-independent dataset.

Results: We collected 65 publicly available Illumina RNA-seq high
quality Arabidopsis thaliana samples and generated Pearson correl-
ation coexpression networks. These networks were then compared
with those derived from analogous microarray data. We show how
Variance-Stabilizing Transformed (VST) RNA-seq data samples are
the most similar to microarray ones, with respect to inter-sample
variation, correlation coefficient distribution and network topological
architecture. Microarray networks show a slightly higher score in biol-
ogy-derived quality assessments such as overlap with the known
protein—protein interaction network and edge ontological agreement.
Different coexpression network centralities are investigated; in particu-
lar, we show how betweenness centrality is generally a positive marker
for essential genes in A. thaliana, regardless of the platform originating
the data. In the end, we focus on a specific gene network case, show-
ing that although microarray data seem more suited for gene network
reverse engineering, RNA-seq offers the great advantage of extending
coexpression analyses to the entire transcriptome.

1 INTRODUCTION

The comprehensive understanding of the functional molecular
mechanisms in the cell is a major challenge of modern biology
(Kitano, 2002). Network representations have been successfully
used to capture various cellular relationships, ranging from
protein—protein interactions (Breitkreutz et al., 2008) to gene
regulations Wilmaz et al., 2011) and metabolic conversions
Wamada and Bork, 2009). In these networks, biological entities

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(e. g. genes, proteins and metabolites) are represented as nodes,
and their interactions are represented as edges. Biological net-
works can be assembled either by gathering all existing experi-
mental knowledge over relationships between these entities
(Breitkreutz et al., 2008; Caspi et al., 2012; Yilmaz et al.,
2011), or alternatively, when this kind of data is missing, they
can be reconstructed by educated inferences based on data pro-
ﬁles (Hartemink, 2005). The latter approach, often dubbed
‘biological network reverse engineering’ has great cost and time
advantages over, for instance, classical forward genetics
approaches, as it allows to reduce the experimental investigation
to a subset of candidates potentially involved in a particular
biological process WVang et al., 2012). In the speciﬁc case of
reverse-engineered gene networks, the last decade has witnessed
an avalanche in the availability of transcript expression data,
provided mainly by microarray data (Farber and Lusis, 2008),
which has in turn fueled the generation of ‘coexpression’ net-
works Wandepoele et al., 2009). Coexpression networks are un-
directed graph representations of transcriptional co-behaviour
between genes within an organism. In such graphs, genes are
connected by edges representing the similarity in their expression
pattern across several experiments in which both genes are quan-
tiﬁed. These similarities are usually calculated by simple methods
like Pearson correlation (D’haeseleer et al., 2000) or by more
sophisticated approaches such as mutual information (Daub
et al., 2004) or linear modelling Wasilevski et al., 2012). A sig-
niﬁcance value is usually associated to each edge to estimate the
amount of coexpression between any gene pair; in the case of
Pearson correlation, this value is the Pearson Correlation
Coefﬁcient (PCC), which ranges from —1 (perfect negative
linear coexpression) to +1 (perfect positive linear coexpression),
whereas 0 (no correlation) signiﬁes the overall lack of linear re-
lationships between the transcript quantities of the two genes
(Usadel et al., 2009). Coexpression networks have been widely
generated and exploited in studies aimed at the identiﬁcation of
novel gene functions Via the ‘guilt-by-association’ paradigm
Wolfe et al., 2005), which assumes that similar expression pat-
terns correspond to similar functions, times of activation or cel-
lular compartments (Ryngajllo et al., 2011). Noteworthy
successes of this approach have been obtained, for example, in
identifying novel genes involved in plant cell wall synthesis
(Persson et al., 2005), starch metabolism (Fu and Xue, 2010)
and in the human B-cell leukaemia signal transduction
(Basso et al., 2005). At the same time, several standalone coex-
pression tools have been developed (Margolin et al., 2006;
Opgen-Rhein and Strimmer, 2007; Reverter and Chan, 2008)

together with freely accessible online databases (Obayashi et al.,
2013; Usadel et al., 2009).

Coexpression networks have also been studied topologically,
generally showing a modular structure (Bassel et al., 2011) and a
scale-free distribution of their connectivity (Barabasi and Oltvai,
2004; Iancu et al., 2012), meaning that most genes have a small
number of coexpressors, while a few genes behave as coexpres-
sion ‘hubs’. However, the vast majority of these studies have
neglected the growing availability of RNA-seq datasets, which
provide several potential advantages over microarrays WVang
et al., 2009). First of all, RNA-seq does not require prior know-
ledge of the studied organism, extending its usage even to poorly
characterized organisms (Balakrishnan et al., 2012), both for
‘standard’ purposes (transcriptome deﬁnition and differential
gene expression) and for any derived application (such as
sample clustering or coexpression analysis). Furthermore,
RNA-seq allows for the identiﬁcation of all transcripts, whereas
microarrays usually cover only a subset of the transcriptome.
For example, in Arabidopsis thaliana, the most used microarray
for quantitative transcriptomics (Edgar et al., 2002; Giorgi et al.,
2010), the Affymetrix ATHl, covers reliably and unambiguously
only 21 377 genes [based on the most recent CustomCDF anno-
tation (Dai et al., 2005)], which is only a subset of the entire
genome [27 416 genes in the TAIR10 annotation release
(Swarbreck et al., 2008)]. Finally, RNA-seq has the potential
to detect novel transcribed loci on annotated genomes (Roberts
et al., 2011), splicing variants (Richard et al., 2010) and
allele-speciﬁc events (Zhang et al., 2009), massively increasing
the investigative capability over these molecular phenomena.

In the present study, we try to determine whether RNA-seq
data can be efﬁciently used for coexpression analysis. To do so,
we derive coexpression networks from a set of 65 high quality
Illumina-based RNA-seq A.thaliana experiments, and compare
them with those extracted from biologically analogous and
equally sized microarray data. We determine the nature of
these networks, both biologically and topologically, with an
overview on different network centralities and their association
with gene essentiality (J eong et al., 2001) in Arabidopsis. Finally,
we focus on two speciﬁc gene cases, showing how the increased
detection range of RNA-seq can indeed cover missing areas of
the coexpression networks.

2 METHODS

2.1 Dataset selection and preprocessing

We downloaded 95 samples from the NCBI Sequence Read Archive
(Leinonen et al., 2011). After the SRA ﬁles were collected, the archives
were extracted and saved in FASTQ format. The FASTQ ﬁles were
trimmed using ERNE-FILTER software (Available: http://erne.source—
forge.net), with default parameters and minimum read length at least
70% of the original size. All samples with <30% of the reads surviving
the trimming process were discarded. Surviving reads (986482 909) were
aligned on the TAIR10 A.thaliana reference genome (Swarbreck et al.,
2008) using TopHat v2.0.4 (Trapnell et al., 2009). Samples where <30%
of the trimmed reads aligned on the Arabidopsis transcriptome were not
considered for coexpression analysis. The 831 286 856 aligned reads (cor-
responding to 65 ﬁnal samples, see Supplementary File S1 for details)
were then summarized at the gene level based on the TAIR10 annotation
by Cuffdiff v2.0.2 (Trapnell et al., 2010), which provided also the raw

count and the RPKM (Reads Per Kilobase of gene model per Million
mapped reads) values (Mortazavi et al., 2008). Raw counts were modiﬁed
into normalized values via the Variance-Stabilizing Transformation
(VST) method implemented in the R package DESeq (Anders and
Huber, 2010). Analogous tissue and condition microarray datasets (see
Supplementary File S1) were downloaded from Gene Expression
Omnibus (Edgar et al., 2002) and normalized using MAS5 (Hubbell
et al., 2002). All microarray samples were quality tested using the
Robin software (Lohse et al., 2010).

2.2 Construction and evaluation of coexpression networks

PCCs between all gene pairs were calculated for each dataset, and net-
works with varying correlation coefﬁcient thresholds were extracted.
Only positive PCCs above the speciﬁed thresholds were converted into
a network edge, to allow for the application of network quality assess-
ments based on the assumption of co-presence (or co-absence) of gene
expression, speciﬁcally the existence of protein—protein interaction and/ or
activating gene regulation, and the belonging to the same functional
group (Jordan et al., 2004; Vandepoele et al., 2009).

The Mapman-based iso-ontological percentage in the networks was
obtained by counting the number of edges containing two genes with
at least one shared Mapman ontology term (Klie and Nikoloski, 2012).
Owing to the highly grained nature of the Mapman bins, the ontology
was trimmed to the third branch (e.g. bin 1.3.1.10 would become 1.3.1).
The total percentage agreement is then calculated by dividing the number
of agreeing edges by the total number of edges in the network. Edges
containing genes of unknown function (Mapman bin 35) were ignored for
this calculation.

The A.thaliana reference protein—protein interaction network, collect-
ing 96 827 protein interactions, was obtained from AtPin version
Jun-2010 (Brandiiao et al., 2009). The reference genetic interaction net-
work, composed by 11355 positive genetic interactions, was obtained
from AtRegNet version 15-Sep-2010 Wilmaz et al., 2011).

The ﬁt of degree distribution of the coexpression networks to a power
law was calculated as in (Brohée et al., 2008).

Networks were graphically represented using Cytoscape (Smoot et al.,
2011); node colouring was applied to the networks following the
Mapman ontology described within the CorTo tool (Available at:
http://www.usadellab.org/cms/index.php?page=corto) and in
Supplementary File S2.

2.3 Network centrality and essential genes

A manually curated list of 481 essential genes was obtained from
SeedGenes v8 (Tzafrir et al., 2003). Degree, shortest path betweenness
and clustering coefﬁcient network centralities were calculated with an
implementation of the J UNG library (Available: http://jung.source-
forge.net). Receiver-operating characteristic (ROC) curves (Beck and
Shultz, 1986) were generated for essential genes by using a sliding thresh-
old (t'), namely every different degree (tdeg), betweenness (Tbtw) and clus-
tering coefﬁcient (1010) values in the population, and then calculating the
number of true positive essential genes above each ‘L’. Joint centrality
ROC curves were calculated by averaging the ranking in the three cen-
tralities (degree, clustering coefﬁcient and betweenness) for each gene.
Further details are available in the Supplementary material
(Supplementary File S3).

2.4 Ontology enrichment analysis

Mapman ontology term over-representation analyses were performed
using the most recent A.thaliana Mapman TAIR9 mapping (Thimm
et al., 2004) via a Bonferroni-corrected Fisher’s Exact Test (Upton,
1992) as implemented in the CorTo software. Over-represented
Mapman bin pairs (to estimate the functional enrichment in edges)

3 RESULTS

3.1 Properties of the coexpression networks

We collected 65 Illumina RNA-seq samples (totalling 831 286 856
aligned reads) representing a wide range of A.thaliana tissues and
conditions. Expression values for each gene were calculated (i) as
the count of aligned reads over the transcript sequence (‘raw
counts’); (ii) after RPKM normalization (Mortazavi et al.,
2008), which simply adjusts raw counts using the number of
mapped reads and gene lengths; and (iii) after VST normaliza-
tion, a method designed to transform count data into values
distributed homoscedastically (Anders and Huber, 2010) (see
Supplementary File S3). We decided to pair each of the 65
RNA-seq samples with corresponding microarray experiments,
via a manual research of the Gene Expression Omnibus database
(Edgar et al., 2002) for the best tissue/condition/ecotype match,
to keep comparability between these two data sources as high as
possible. Despite this, sample clustering shows a clear distinction
between the two platforms. However, VST normalization gener-
ally brings RNA-seq samples hierarchically closer to microarrays
than RPKM normalization or raw counts (Supplementary File
S4).

Correlating samples to each other shows that microarrays are
more similar to each other (Fig. 1A). It is known that even with a
single-array normalization method such as MAS5, which does
not overestimate sample correlation (Lim et al., 2007), micro-
array samples tend to be highly correlated to each other
(Giorgi et al., 2010). Correlation coefﬁcients between samples
are much lower in publicly available A.thaliana RNA-seq data

Fig. 1. Correlation in expression datasets. (A) Box plots showing PCCs
between samples. (B) Density distributions of PCCs between genes

when compared with similarly sized combinations of randomly
taken publicly available microarrays (Giorgi et al., 2010). RPKM
normalization, supposed to increase comparability between sam-
ples (Mortazavi et al., 2008), is indeed reducing sample variabil-
ity when compared with raw counts. VST normalization yields a
high inter-sample correlation, comparable with microarray levels
(Fig. 1A).

Concerning PCCs between genes, which is the basic parameter
on which coexpression networks are built in most studies (Usadel
et al., 2009), microarray data yield a symmetrical bell-shaped
distribution (Fig. 1B, solid line), almost perfectly overlapped
by VST-normalized RNA-seq data (Fig. 1B, dotted grey line).
RNA-seq raw count data show a bimodal correlation distribu-
tion (Fig. 1B, cross-pointed line), as noted before in a smaller
dataset comparison (Iancu et al., 2012), where this increase was
explained by the greater sensitivity and dynamic range of
RNA-seq data. RPKM normalization shows a bell-shaped
curve slightly skewed towards negative values, and not centered
over a zero value (Fig. 1B, plus-pointed line). All data generate
correlations between gene expressions that are higher than the
random PCC distribution (Fisher, 1915) (Fig. 1B, dashed line).
Because the expected random distribution depends on the
number of samples in the original dataset (not on the number
of variables/ genes), these differences are not merely owing to the
different number of genes detected by microarrays versus
RNA-seq. Distributions of correlation coefﬁcients for raw
RNA-seq counts approach a monomodal distribution for
log2-transformed data and Spearman correlation coefﬁcients
(Supplementary File S5).

An immediate consequence of different PCC distributions is
the difference in the relationship between coexpression network
size and PCC threshold used to build it (Fig. 2A). Microarray
data, given the same threshold, yield smaller networks than
RNA-seq, message that should warn against the application of
the same rule-of-thumb signiﬁcance thresholds applied before in
coexpression studies, with PCC = 0.7 as a frequently used value
(Jordan et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2007; Usadel et al., 2009).

For each PCC threshold plotted in Figure 2A, we calculated
several biological and topological properties. The overlap of a
coexpression network with protein—protein interaction networks
is a common criterion for biology-based network quality assess-
ment (Lim et al., 2007; Usadel et al., 2009). In fact, direct
Pearson correlation has successfully been used before for iden-
tifying proteins belonging to the same complex, as these usually
require genes to be coexpressed to yield stoichiometrically
balanced proteic products (Teichmann and Babu, 2002). In this
respect, microarray data allow to achieve the highest perform-
ance in terms of Matthews Correlation Coefﬁcient (MCC) (Baldi
et al., 2000) and accuracy in the overlap between coexpression
connections and the 96 827 experimentally validated A.thaliana
physical protein—protein interactions (Brandiiao et al., 2009)
(Fig. 2B and Supplementary File S6). RNA-seq data allow for
positive coexpression-based estimation (i.e. positive MCCs) only
for PCCs >0.8, with raw counts achieving higher prediction
power than normalized counts. The accuracy of the coexpression
analysis shows a constant increase proportional to the threshold
stringency applied to generate the networks (Supplementary
File S6). However, and unexpectedly, the overlap between pro-
tein—protein interaction networks and coexpression networks is

very low, as shown by the generally weak MCCs (even for micro-
array data, reaching at most a value of 0.0067).

Regardless of the expression measurement method or the PCC
threshold applied, edges derived from coexpression networks are
always negative or null predictors (Fig. 2C) of the manually
curated collection of 11 355 A.thaliana transcription factor-target
relationships Wilmaz et al., 2011). Although direct static
coexpression measures such as Pearson correlation are known
to be positive estimators of static protein interactions
(Zampieri et al., 2008), they are usually counter-predictive or
meaningless for causal relationships like transcription factor—
target interactions. In these cases, more complex methods that
can remove indirect and spurious edges are suggested, such as
Partial Correlation (de la F uente et al., 2004; Schafer et al., 2001)
or LASSO Wasilevski et al., 2012). However, even full partial
correlation networks (Schafer et al., 2001) derived from
both microarray and RNA-seq data have negative MCCs with
the annotated Arabidopsis genetic network (Supplementary
File S7).

Another common evaluation method of data-derived net-
works is the assessment of the ontological nature of the edges
(Lim et al., 2007), which assumes that a positive-hit edge is the
one connecting genes sharing at least one biological function. To
do so, we assessed the edges of our coexpression networks using
the Mapman ontology (Thimm et al., 2004) (Fig. 2D), a
plant-oriented ﬁnely grained version of the more generic Gene
Ontology (Klie and Nikoloski, 2012). This ontological assess-
ment is partially biased, because also genes with different func-
tions can be coregulated in reality (Lim et al., 2007). However, it
guarantees a qualitative estimate—independent from experimen-
tally proven interactions—for the 63.1% of Arabidopsis genes
that are functionally annotated by Mapman; since the fraction of
annotated genes is slightly higher in the population represented
by the ATH1 microarray (67.9%, Supplementary File S8), we
used the intersection between genelists in the two data types to
perform this analysis. Our data show that microarray-derived
networks (Fig. 2D) possess the highest percentage of iso-
ontological edges, while all other data types perform poorly. A
clear connection between threshold stringency and the percent-
age of edges sharing genes belonging to at least one common
ontological term is evident only for microarray-based networks
(Fig. 2D), warning against the direct application of functional
clustering methods (Mutwil et al., 2010) on RNA-seq-derived
coexpression networks.

We also analysed the networks topologically by ﬁtting their
global connectivity to a power law distribution (Brohée et al.,
2008). All coexpression networks, regardless of the type of tran-
script data used, show a good ﬁt to a scale-free distribution
(Fig. 2E), with R2 always >0.7 whenever the PCC threshold re-
duces the number of connections below 107 (Fig. 2A) (Barabasi
and Oltvai, 2004). There seems to be an optimal scale-free PCC
threshold, which is 0.78 for microarray, 0.86 for RPKM, 0.88 for
VST and 0.95 for raw count networks. These thresholds corres-
pond also to a positive overlap (Fig. 2B) with the A.thaliana
protein—protein interaction network [also scale-free (Brandiiao
et al., 2009)].

3.2 Centrality and essentiality in coexpression networks

We now focus on speciﬁc networks, selected by visual inspection
based on the best overall qualities (Fig. 2) at three different sizes
(simply dubbed ‘small’, ‘medium’ and ‘large’) and summarized in
Table 1. On these networks, we calculated for each gene, three
different measures for network centrality (Koscht'itzki and
Schreiber, 2008), speciﬁcally degree (number of connections),
clustering coefﬁcient (normalized amount of connections be-
tween the gene’s neighbours) and shortest path betweenness (nor-
malized number of times the gene is crossed by a shortest path
connecting two other genes). Regardless of the data and network
size used, we constantly see a positive correlation between degree
and betweenness, and a negative correlation between clustering
coefﬁcient and betweenness (Supplementary File S9). In network
biology, a strong association between centrality and gene func-
tion has been observed for a long time: for instance, essential
genes products tend to have more distinct interactors (i.e. a
higher degree) than non-essential ones (Jeong et al., 2001), high
betweenness genes tend to be key network regulators (Joy et al.,
2005) and cancer genes have a signiﬁcantly higher degree and
clustering coefﬁcient than other genes (Rambaldi et al., 2008). In
coexpression analysis, this relationship is less investigated; how-
ever, it has been proven that embryonic-essential Arabidopsis
genes (Tzafrir et al., 2003) have a signiﬁcantly higher degree
than the rest of the transcriptome in microarray-based coexpres-
sion networks (Mutwil et al., 2010). The same is true in our
microarray, VST and raw count (but not RPKM) gene networks,
where the essential genes are consistently and signiﬁcantly more
connected than non-essential ones (Table 2). In microarray-
derived networks, degree, clustering coefﬁcient and betweenness
in all three thresholds analysed are positive predictors for

essentiality (Table 2 and Fig. 3A). For networks derived from
RPKM-normalized data, betweenness is the only parameter sig-
niﬁcantly associated with essentiality, albeit not in high threshold
networks (Fig. 3C), while RNA-seq raw counts and VST-based
networks show again the tendency of essential genes to possess a
high degree and a high betweenness (Fig. 3B and D). The con-
nection with clustering coefﬁcient is lost in larger RNA-seq
networks (Table 2).

In general, essential genes possess a signiﬁcantly higher
betweenness in almost all A.thaliana coexpression networks
(Supplementary File S9), while there seems to be no advantage
in combining all three centralities by average gene ranking
(Fig. 4), an approach used before for essential gene detection
(Joy et al., 2005). It is clear, however, that coexpression network
degree alone, as stated before for degree in protein—protein inter-
action networks WVuchty, 2002), is not always a sufﬁcient pre-
dictor for gene essentiality in RNA-seq networks, while it is a
valid predictor in microarray networks.

3.3 Biological insights from coexpression networks

We then functionally annotated and intersected the networks
described in Table 1 and looked at them at a greater detail
(Fig. 4, Supplementary Files S2 and S10). There is a low size
overlap between microarray— and RNA-seq-derived coexpression
networks (Fig. 4A). This is perhaps not entirely surprising, given
the technical low correlation between these two techniques, es-
pecially for high and low transcript abundances WVang et al.,
2009). However, microarray-derived networks are more similar
to VST-derived ones (12.7% shared edges relative to total micro-
array network size) than those based on RPKM or raw counts
(respectively, 6.2% and 5.0%). Also, the overlap between
RNA-seq networks is constantly below 50% of their total sizes
(Supplementary File S10, the highest overlap is visible between
raw counts and RPKM), posing an interesting caveat about the
comparability of coexpression inferences made with differently
normalized RNA-seq data [the same issue was reported before
for different normalization procedures on microarray data (Lim
et al., 2007)]. Each of the networks derived by our analysis seems
to be focusing on different parts of the cellular transcriptome
(Fig. 4B): for example, microarrays show a high propensity of
coexpression for RNA-processing genes with other functional
areas, and RPKM-based networks describe several transport-
related coexpressions.

An intersection of all networks describes a few backbone coex-
pression structures well known in literature, like the relationship
between cell wall synthesis/degradation and regulation of tran-
scription (Mutwil et al., 2010) or the one between biotic stress
and post-translational modiﬁcation mechanisms (Mishra et al.,
2006). Genes coding for ribosomal proteins are also highly coex-
pressed to each other (Fig. 4B and Supplementary File S2).

One of the great advantages of coexpression analysis is its
possibility to propose novel candidate genes for incompletely
characterized biological pathways (Persson et al., 2005;
Vasilevski et al., 2012). RNA-seq allows a quantitative assess-
ment of the entire transcriptome, therefore extending this type of
inference over genes where microarray-based coexpression inves-
tigations are not an option. One of these genes is Sphavata
(At5g21960), a poorly characterized ethylene-responsive factor

gene (ERF) known to be induced by jasmonate (Giuntoli et al.,
2009). In fact, the top 100 correlators for Sphavata calculated by
all three normalizations of RNA-seq data (Supplementary File
S11) show a signiﬁcant over-representation for genes involved in
jasmonate metabolism (Mapman bin 17.7) and belonging to the
ERF family (Mapman bin 27.3.3).

On the other hand, a well-studied gene for coexpression ana-
lysis is RHM2, a NDP-L-rhamnose synthase involved in polysac-
charide branching and necessary for Arabidopsis seed coat
mucilage pectin biosynthesis (Usadel et al., 2004). This gene
has been used as a coexpression bait to identify novel genes
involved in the mucilage pathway (Haughn and Western, 2012)
by using correlation analysis over a microarray seed dataset
Wasilevski et al., 2012). Our analysis shows the potential in iden-
tifying novel genes coexpressing with RHMZ (Fig. 5 and
Supplementary File S12): among the top 10 positive correlators
identiﬁed using RNA-seq data, four genes not present on the
Arabidopsis microarray were identiﬁed, three of which putatively
involved in polysaccharide synthesis (Swarbreck et al., 2008):
At2g26100 (a putative galactosyltransferase), At3g06550

total, six coexpressors of RHMZ are already annotated as

found with RNA-seq data (U GP2) is an essential gene active on
nucleotide sugar pyrophosphorylation (Meng et al., 2009). All
these genes may be novel candidates in the pectin biosynthesis

Comparative study of RNA-seq- and Microarray-derived coexpression networks in Arabidopsis thaliana

 

pathway. At the same time, RNA-seq-based coexpression is able
to identify GAUTl, a a-l,4-galacturonosyltransferase already
known to be active, as RHM2, within the pectin branching me-
tabolism (Sterling et al., 2006).

4 DISCUSSION

Our results describe the ﬁrst large scale (65 samples) attempt to
use RNA-seq data collected from multiple tissues and experi-
mental conditions for gene network reverse engineering. We
show that coexpression networks generated from this novel
technology are indeed realistic (Fig. 2) and accurate, with accur-
acy increasing together with network stringency, validating the
assumption that RNA-seq-based coexpression is a better-than-
random selector of real biological relationships (Supplementary
File S6). However, our results show that microarray-based coex-
pression networks based on simple correlation achieve a higher
similarity to biological networks, and at the same time show a
low overlap with RNA-seq-based representations (Fig. 4).
Unexpectedly, although Arabidopsis coexpression networks are
generally positive predictors of protein—protein interactions, the
overlap is quite small and associated to weak MCCs in all cases
(Fig. 2B).

All RNA-seq networks show a scale-free topology (Fig. 2E) as
previously noted on a smaller dataset (Iancu et al., 2012), but no
RNA-seq dataset allowed to reach microarray-like network qua-
lities, neither as raw counts nor after two popular normalization
procedures (RPKM and VST) (Figs 2 and 3 and Table 1).
VST-normalized data possess microarray-like behaviour with
regards to correlation coefﬁcient distribution and topological
network properties (size and degree distribution, Fig. 2A and
E). Amongst RNA-seq data, VST networks also possess the
highest proximity to microarray networks detected by hierarch-
ical clustering (Supplementary File S4) and edge intersection
(Supplementary File S10). RPKM and raw count networks, per-
haps owing to the heteroscedasticity of these types of data
(Anders and Huber, 2010), differ more markedly from micro-
array networks than VST networks.

We also ﬁnd that coexpression network betweenness centrality
can be calculated from RNA-seq data and used as a positive
marker for A.thaliana essential genes (Table 2). The task of iden-
tifying essential genes has been called the ‘most important task of
genomics-based target validation’ (Chalker and Lunsford, 2002),
as these genes are extremely important not only to understand
the minimal requirements for life (Li et al., 2011), but also
because they are excellent drug targets (Cole, 2002).

Another important application of coexpression analysis is in
the identiﬁcation of novel genes and novel gene functions. To
this respect, we show how RNA-seq data can be complementary
to microarray data in describing the functional neighbourhood
of a pectin metabolism gene (Fig. 5) or to conﬁrm the connection
with jasmonate of a poorly characterized putative transcription
factor (Supplementary File S11). There are at least 6953
A.thaliana genes annotated on the TAIR10 genome but not rep-
resented by any probeset on the Affymetrix ATH1 microarray
platform; 3578 of these genes have no functional annotation—
neither experimentally inferred, nor predicted in silico (Thimm
et al., 2004)—which gives RNA-seq the unique possibility to
functionally investigate a previously uncovered portion of the

transcriptome. This potential can indeed be transposed to
other organisms as well, given the fair conservation of coexpres-
sion across species, at least in the plant kingdom (Movahedi
et al., 2012). All data investigated in this article are preloaded
and can be freely analysed by the CorTo coexpression tool.
Despite its obvious advantages, the unexpected relative under-
performance of RNA-seq versus microarrays in network recon-
struction raises an important caveat on its direct usability for
coexpression analysis, at least by the simple Pearson correlation
criteria used in this work. The creation of novel approaches to
properly normalize and interpret gene count correlations gener-
ated by Next-Generation Sequencing will pose a future
fundamental challenge for coexpression investigators.

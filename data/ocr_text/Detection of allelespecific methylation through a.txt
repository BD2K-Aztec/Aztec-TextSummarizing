ABSTRACT

Motivations: High-throughput sequencing has made it possible
to sequence DNA methylation of a whole genome at the single-
base resolution. A sample, however, may contain a number of
distinct methylation patterns. For instance, cells of different types
and in different developmental stages may have different methyl-
ation patterns. Alleles may be differentially methylated, which may
partially explain that the large portions of epigenomes from single
cell types are partially methylated, and may have major effects
on transcriptional output. Approaches relying on DNA sequence
polymorphism to identify individual patterns from a mixture of
heterogeneous epigenomes are insufficient as methylcytosines
occur at a much higher density than SNPs.

Results: We have developed a mixture model-based approach for
resolving distinct epigenomes from a heterogeneous sample. In
particular, the model is applied to the detection of allele-specific
methylation (ASM). The methods are tested on a synthetic methylome
and applied to an Arabidopsis single root cell methylome.

1 INTRODUCTION

The advancement of high—throughput sequencing has opened up
many important areas of applications, one of which is epigenome
sequencing. DNA methylation may repress or activate transcription,
and is known to be involved in embryogenesis, genomic imprinting
and tumorigenesis in mammals, and transposon silencing in
plants (Bestor, 2000; Li et al., 1992; Lippman et al., 2004; Rhee
et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2006; Zilberman et al., 2007). To
understand the regulation and dynamics of DNA methylation, the
locations of the modiﬁed cytosines need to be identiﬁed. The ﬁrst
single—base resolution mappings of DNA methylation were produced
for the whole Arabidopsis thaliana genome (Cokus et al., 2008;
Lister et al., 2008) and for selected subsets of sites in the mouse
genome (Meissner et al., 2008) using various bisulﬁte sequencing
technologies. DNA methylation is the modiﬁcation of DNA base
cytosine (methylcytosine). A map of DNA methylation at single—base
resolution is referred to as methylome or epigenome.

Cells of different types and in different developmental stages
may have different methylation patterns. It has been observed
that large portions of the Arabidopsis methylomes are partially
methylated (Lister et al., 2008). This may be as a result of the

sample containing a number of distinct methylomes. Aberrant
methylation is also a general feature of cancer genomes. A better
understanding of methylation patterns in cancer genomes may lead
to both new diagnostic markers and therapies based on the detection
of methylation changes occurring early in tumorigenesis (Laird,
2003). In a tumor tissue particularly of an early stage, however,
cancerous cells and normal cells are often mixed together. DNA
methylation patterns can also act as markers for tracing stem cell
expansion and tumor growth (Kim et al., 2005; Shibata and Tavare,
2006; Yatabe et al., 2001). Making use of methylation patterns in
this way requires determining methylation patterns associated with
individual cells or cells from the same clone.

When comparing human ﬁbroblast cell IMR90 and H1 embryonic
stem cell (ESC) lines, it is observed that IMR90 has a lower level
of methylation than H1 ESC (Lister et al., 2009). Both IMR90 and
H1 are of a single cell type. While it is expected that large portions
(80%) of the X chromosome are partially methylated as the IMR90
cell line is from a female and the DNA methylation is known to play
an important role in X chromosome inactivation (Riggs, 1975), it is
unexpectedly observed that around 38% of IMR90 autosomes are
identiﬁed as partially methylated domains (PMD). What is the nature
of partial methylations in a single cell type? Might allelic differences
contribute to the partial methylations? Answering these questions
requires detecting allele—speciﬁc methylation (ASM) patterns.

The methylcytosine is sometimes referred to as the ﬁfth DNA
base (Lister and Ecker, 2009). Applying methods for detection of
single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) to methylation, however,
may present difﬁculties. Methylcytosine is much more dynamic than
nucleotides and observations generally suggest that methylation of
a cytosine site is a statistical event. Unlike SNPs where a nucleotide
occurs at a rate of 0, 50 or 100% in a diploid individual (if sequencing
errors may be ignored), the methylation level at a particular site
may fall anywhere in the range from 0% to 100%. Whether a
methylcytosine is allele—speciﬁc therefore cannot be determined by
the site alone. It needs supporting evidence from the neighboring
nucleotides.

If a partially methylated cytosine is in the close vicinity of a
SNP such that reads are long enough to cover both sites, then
it is straightforward to determine from which allele the reads are
originated thus determining the methylation level of the respective
alleles. Some studies have shown that ASM is associated with
SNPs (Kerkel et al., 2008; Shoemaker et al., 2010). The density
of methylation across the whole genome, however, is much higher
than that of DNA sequence polymorphism. For instance, while there
are close to 3 million SNPs discovered in the human genome ~62
million and 45 million methylcytosines were detected in H1 and

IMR90 cells (Lister et al., 2009). It has also been observed that
changes in cytosine methylation occur at a frequency much greater
than that of the DNA sequence mutations (Ossowski et al., 2010;
Schmitz et al., 2011). As a result, SNPs are absent in large portions of
the methylomes. We will describe a method in this article that detects
ASM without the assistance of SNPs. In addition, even though the
functionalities of ASM are not well understood except that they play
an important role in imprinting (Hellman and Chess, 2007; Kerkel
et al., 2008), it seems that the methylation level of an individual
cytosine is less important than the overall levels of methylations
within a region, which is also in contrast to the SNPs. We, therefore,
focus our effort in detecting regions of ASM.

The remainder of the article is organized as follows. A mixture
model is described in Section 2 for modeling the outcome of a
methylation sequencing experiment where the sample may contain
a mixture of heterogeneous epigenomes. It aims at predicting
methylation levels for each cytosine in each individual epigenome.
Section 3 lays out the details for detecting regions of ASM based
on the mixture model and validates the methods on a synthetic
methylome. The methods are then applied to an Arabidopsis root
cell methylome and the results are listed in Section 4. Section 5
discusses the results and offers some future directions.

2 A MIXTURE MODEL FOR HETEROGENEOUS
EPIGENOMES

In bisulﬁte sequencing experiments, DNA fragments are treated
with sodium bisulﬁte. The process converts unmethylated cytosines
into uracils. The sequence of nucleotides (reads) in the converted
fragments are subsequently determined by a sequencer. The reads
produced by the sequencer are aligned to a reference genome.
Usually only uniquely mapped reads are retained. As a result, what
we have is a set of reads that are most similar in sequence to their
respective mapped locations in the reference genome, which are
presumably the genomic origins of the fragments that produced the
reads. In addition, each cytosine on every mapped read is labeled as
either methylated or unmethylated.

The methylation level of a particular cytosine is computed as
follows: if there are x reads that map to the position, and y out of the
x reads have at this position a methylcytosine, then the methylation
level is y /x. Note that if the read depth at a cytosine position is
below a certain threshold, which is determined by the allowed false
positive rate, the methylation is not called, i.e. y=0. (Lister et al.,
2008)

If the original sample is composed of a mixture of epigenomes,
be it from a set of different cell types, tissues or alleles, the mapped
reads will reﬂect the mixture. Our goal is to infer the original makeup
of the mixture from the mapped reads. It should be noted that the
attainment of the goal depends on whether the original epigenomes
are sufﬁciently heterogeneous so that we may distinguish them.

As we are only concerned with methylation, we restrict the reads
to the genomic positions where the methylation level is greater
than zero. The epigenomes and reads may be represented as binary
strings, where methylcytosine is set to 1 and the remainder to 0.
Let R be a set of binary strings, which we assume are the reads
produced by a bisulﬁte sequencing experiment further restricted to
methylation sites. For string rER, let xrl- be the letter appearing
at position i from r; let [ra,rb] be the positions that r spans. Let
C: {cl-Ii: 1---k} be the set of natural frequencies of epigenomes,

where cj is the frequency of the j—th epigenome, and k is the total
number of epigenomes. When the model is used to detect the ASM of
a diploid organism, k equals to 2. Let M ={m,j|i=1---n,j=1---k},
where m,:,- is the probability of methylation of epigenome j at position
i, and n is the length of the epigenome. The probability of observing
string r is

k
P(r)= chprj,
i=1
where prj is the probability that string r originates from epigenome
j,and

i=ra
The probability of observing the set R is therefore
P(M, CR): 171%),
rER
or equivalently the log likelihood
l(M, C,R) = ZlogPU).
rER

The optimization goal is to determine parameters C and M such
that the probability of observing the set R is maximum, thus
best explaining the reads. We estimate array C and matrix M by
maximizing the likelihood l,
argmaxM, C ZlogP(r),
rER
which can be solved by using the expectation—maximization (EM)
algorithm (Dempster et al., 1977). First, we deﬁne a membership
matrix
A={arj|r€R,j=1...k},
where
1 if re j,
a i:
U 0 if r¢ j.

As the membership of string r with respect to epigenome j is
unknown, it is estimated by its expected value as
arj : —ijrj .
Zj/Cj/prj/

The likelihood can then be rewritten as

(2)

k
W, C,R,A> = ZZarJ- 10g(cjprj), (3)
rERj=l
and the optimization becomes

argmaxM , C 2 Zarj log(cjprj).
rERj=l

Solving the maximization constrained by ZfZICjZI yields the
update equations at each M—step iteration of the EM algorithm as

Detection of Allele-Specific Methylation

 

3 DETECTION OF ASM

In this section, we describe how the model is used to detect
allele—speciﬁc methylated regions in a diploid organism. Notice
that ASM is not a precisely deﬁned term. It generally refers to a
signiﬁcant difference between the methylation levels of the two
alleles. First, the methylome of a diploid individual is scanned
for partially methylated regions (PMRs) as candidates for further
analysis. Second, for each candidate region, the reads that align
to this region are computationally assigned to the two alleles and
the methylation levels of individual cytosines from each allele are
estimated. Last, regions are classiﬁed to allele—speciﬁc or non—
speciﬁc methylated regions, based on read assignments and the
predicted methylation levels from the previous step. A synthetic
methylome is used to test the model and to illustrate the details of
each step.

We remark that determining whether a read along with its
methylcytosines has a higher probability to originate from one
allele or the other relies on the differences between the reads, i.e.
the methylation states of the cytosines on the reads. The density
of methylcytosines of a genome relative to the read length in a
sequencing experiment is therefore critical. For instance, if, on
average, a read covers at most one methylcytosine, then there
is very little hope to deconvolve the allelic methylation states
without additional information. While anticipating the rapid growth
of the read length in high—throughput sequencing technology, we
ﬁrst tested our method on Arabidopsis thaliana, which has a
reasonably high methylation density. The median genomic distance,
for instance, between consecutive methylcytosines on Chromosome
1 of A. thaliana Col—0 is 15, while the typical read length of an
Illumina sequencer is between 100 and 150 bp presently.

3.1 Identify PMRs as candidates

To detect ASM regions, the whole methylome is scanned for PMRs
as candidates, as there is obviously not much difference between
the two alleles if the methylation level of a region is near nil
or complete. A contiguous methylated region (CMR) refers to
a genomic region where the genomic distance between any two
consecutive methylcytosines is no larger than a separation threshold
s, which is set at around a width comparable to the read length.
Each CMR is scanned with a ﬁxed—width sliding window where
the window width is the number of methylcytosines. A ﬁxed—width
window inside a CMR is classiﬁed as a PMR if no fewer than 90% of
the methylcytosines are at most 70% methylated (Lister et al., 2009).
A PMR may be called with or without a speciﬁc lower bound for
methylation levels. In the data we have analyzed, the average level
of methylations in a CMR is at least 25%, due to that (i) the region
has contiguous methylcytosines; (ii) the allowed false positive rate
for calling a methylcytosine (Lister et al., 2008) in combination
with the sequencing coverage dictates an implicit lower bound on
the methylation levels. Consecutive PMRs within the same CMR
are merged into a single region.

The dataset being tested is a synthetic methylome that is made up
by combining the reads of two methylomes from Arabidopsis root
cells: epidermis (Wer+) and endodermis (Scr+). The root cells are
obtained by ﬂow sorting; their methylomes by Methle—Seq bisulﬁte
sequencing (Lister et al., 2008). The genomic length of the reads is
83 bp. The reads from one cell type in the mixture are treated as
if they are from one allele of the synthetic methylome. The ASM

of the synthetic methylome is, therefore, simulated by cell—speciﬁc
methylation in the mixture. Forward strand and reverse strand are
processed separately.

As ASM and cell—speciﬁc methylation arise from different
biological processes, the patterns of differential methylations
might, therefore, carry signatures unique to each type. The
aforementioned synthetic methylome is appropriate for testing cell—
speciﬁc methylations; yet whether it is a good surrogate for testing
ASMs may be questioned. We argue that since the classiﬁcation is
largely based on overall methylation levels within a region rather
than relations among methylation levels of individual cytosine
sites, the criteria similarly apply to both cell—speciﬁc methylation
and ASM.

The separation threshold s is set to 100 bp. Each CMR is scanned
with a sliding window of width 20, 35 and 50 methylcytosines
respectively. Each PMR in the synthetic methylome is labeled as
either cell—speciﬁc (allele—speciﬁc), if no fewer than 90% cytosines
in the region are methylated in only one of the two cells, or non—
speciﬁc otherwise. For the purpose of learning, consecutive windows
within the same CMR are merged into one region only if they are
labeled as the same type. For a sliding window of width 20, both
cell—speciﬁc regions and non—speciﬁc regions have a median width
of 23 methylcytosines. All of the cell— speciﬁc regions and around the
same number of randomly selected non—speciﬁc regions are kept as
samples for further analysis. The samples are divided into training
and testing samples (Table 1).

3.2 Predict allelic methylation levels

For each PMR, the algorithm described in Section 2 is applied with
k :2. For each sample of the synthetic methylome, the reads from
the two individual methylomes are mixed together.

One potential problem with the EM algorithm is that it may
converge to a local optimum. There are various ways to initialize
the parameters. One initialization is to randomly assign each read
to a cluster, i.e. set arj=1 at probability 1/k. Another option is
to set cf 2 1/k, and then randomize matrix M. A third option is
to randomize the membership matrix A, which appears to be the
best option after testing with simulated data. We run the algorithm
L times, each with a new random matrix A as the initialization.
Let A1 , A2, . . . ,AL be the membership matrix when each individual
run converges, from which two new initializations are derived:
AL+1 and ALTZ, for two additional runs.1 They are deﬁned as

 

1A subtlety here concerns the ordering of the clusters at the end of each run.
The details are omitted.

Both experimental and predicted methylation states are shown. The
experimental data are from the individual methylomes and are thus
treated as golden. The predicted methylation states are used for
further classiﬁcation.

3.3 Classify candidate regions with a support vector
machine classiﬁer

Once the methylation levels of individual methylcytosines in each
allele are estimated and the membership of reads predicted by the
model, what remains is to characterize and classify each region based
on the estimations. Recall that we used a rather simplistic rule to
automatically label the samples in the synthetic methylome when

preparing the training and testing samples. The labels are derived
from the knowledge of the two individual methylomes making
up the synthetic methylome, and therefore are independent of the
predictions made by the mixture model. One option is to use the
same rule to classify a region from predicted methylation levels. We
hope to capture more characteristics of the two classes, however, so
multiple measures are employed for this task when it is applied to
the real epigenome. We also use the synthetic methylome to train a
support vector machine (SVM) classiﬁer that is later used for a real
single cell methylome. Notice that the value arj gives the probability
that the read r is from allele j. If a read needs to be assigned to a
single allele, it should be assigned to the j that has the larger value
of arj, or formally, to cluster jr 2 argmaxj (arj).

The features for SVM are extracted from the estimated
methylation levels (M) and allele frequencies (C). A total of nine
features are used (details omitted due to exigencies of space). Both
linear and radial basis function (RBF) kernels are tested; the latter
yield better performance. Five—fold cross—validation is used to select
the best parameters for the kernel function from each training set.
The testing results are shown in Table 2. In some of the false positive
(FP) samples, both cells have completely unmethylated reads and
these reads are clustered together in the synthetic methylome, which
are then classiﬁed as allele—speciﬁc (cell—speciﬁc). We hypothesize
that these regions have ASM in both individual cell types.

3.4 Identify ASM regions with multiple ﬁlters

Using an SVM classiﬁer has its limitations. A classiﬁer trained on
one organism will certainly not be appropriate for other organisms.
A classiﬁer trained on one cell type may be questionable for another
very different type. When parameters for the sequencing experiment
change, the classiﬁer should be retrained. In addition, there may not
be sufﬁcient data samples for learning at all. Additional measures
are therefore necessary for real data.

The Mann—Whitney—Wilcoxon (mww) test is performed on the
two clusters resulting from the mixture model. If the null hypothesis
is rejected, one cannot readily claim that the methylations are allele—
speciﬁc. But if on the other hand the null hypothesis is not rejected,
it is unlikely that the methylations are allele—speciﬁc. Two additional
ﬁlters are based on methylation rates. One ﬁlter is called low
methylation rate (lmr). It computes whether one of the two clusters
is 5 10% methylated at Z 80% sites. The other is called differential
averaged methylation rate (dmr). The averaged methylation rate for
each cluster in the region is deﬁned as

l n ml“
242—",
n lmﬂ +mi2

i:
and the differential averaged methylation as
d = In — r2 I .

We deﬁne three classes based on this measure shown in Table 3.

4 DETECT ASM REGIONS FOR ARABIDOPSIS
EPIDERMIS METHYLOME

The methods are applied to the methylome of a single cell type,
a root epidermis (Wer+) cell from A. thaliana Col—0. There are a
total of 452 partially methylated regions as deﬁned in Section 3.1.
The total genomic length of the regions is 84 397 bp, covering 9980
methylcytosines. The 22926 reads are aligned to these regions.
Once the methylation levels of the two alleles and the membership
of all reads are predicted by the models, the results are subject to
four methods for classiﬁcation as mentioned in Sections 3.3 and 3.4.
Recall that the SVM model is trained on the synthetic methylome
made up of two Arabidopsis root methylomes, Wer+ being one of
them. Table 4 shows the number of PMRs predicted to be allele—
speciﬁc by each method and the intersection is taken so as to obtain
the most conservative predictions. The ﬁrst two rows of the table
reﬂect the intersections taken between the dh class and all other
criteria, and dm class and other criteria, respectively, totaling 34
regions. Table 5 lists the details and annotations for group (1), and
Table 6 for group (2). Based on the predicted methylation levels,
both groups are highly allele—speciﬁc. While one of the two alleles
has nearly no methylation, in the ﬁrst group of 18 regions, the other
allele is in general highly methylated; and in the second group
of 16 regions, the methylated allele is more partially methylated.
An example from each group is shown in Figure 2. If the criteria
for ASM are relaxed a bit by removing the rather stringent ﬁlter
lmr, many more regions [the last row (3) in Table 4] are admitted

5 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

We have described a computational model for resolving distinct
epigenomes from a heterogeneous sample. In particular, we applied
this model to identify allele—speciﬁc methylated regions. The reads
from potentially multiple epigenomes are mapped to a common
reference genome. The goal is essentially to infer the distinct
methylation patterns from the mapped reads. Our approach is
different from previous attempts in that it does not rely on
SNPs, which are few and far between when compared with
methylcytosines.

The model was tested on a synthetic methylome. The classiﬁcation
based on the mixture model in conjunction with an SVM classiﬁer
yielded an accuracy of 87.5 %. Even though the SVM approach is
not always applicable to real methylomes, since all the features
are derived from the predicted methylation levels and cluster
frequencies, the test results reﬂect the reliability of the predictions
made by the model. Additional multiple ﬁlters for ASMs may further
reduce the number of false positives.

Additional approaches may be employed to validate the methods
for ASM detection. One approach is to use ASMs determined with
SNP data as ground truth, although such data are presently sparse
and anecdotal. Another approach to validate ASM is to use heritable
epi—alleles in combination with phasing information obtained from
crossing of plants.

Q.Peng and J.R.Ecker

 

We applied the methods to regions of the genome with relatively
high density of methylcytosines with each region being treated
independently. By taking advantage of pair—end reads and other
information, it will also be possible to do phasing and extend
and connect the regions. Our model assumes that methylations are
independent of each other. Methylations in some regions have a
tendency to occur in clusters, which indicates a certain dependency.
While our model gives a reasonably good ﬁrst—order approximation,
Markov chain—based models perhaps may be explored to take the
dependency into consideration. Identifying ASM is still only at
initial research stages. Another direction for future research is to
focus on understanding the functionalities of ASM, for instance,
how they are related to allele—speciﬁc expression.

More complicated heterogeneous epigenome samples may arise
from a mixture of various cell types, or a mixture of cancerous cells
at various stages, which present yet more and greater challenges than
the allelic methylations of a diploid cell. Such samples will enable
an ultimate test for the power of the methods. The initial steps are
to develop scenarios and criteria for validation as it becomes less
obvious what deﬁnes cell—speciﬁc methylations in the context of
multiple cell types.

APPENDIX A

Section 2 described the model for a mixture of epigenomes. This
section details the derivation of the update equations at each M—step
iteration for the EM algorithm.

Recall from Section 2 that the optimization goal is to determine
the methylation probability matrix M and the epigenome frequency
array C such that the likelihood l (M , C ,R,A) as deﬁned by
Equation (3) is maximized given the set of observed restricted reads
R. The membership matrix A is estimated by Equation (2) at each
iteration.

As the maximization of likelihood l (M , C,R,A) is constrained by
2;;1 of = l, i.e. the epigenome frequencies sum up to l, we will
introduce Lagrange multiplier A. and maximize the unconstrained
function

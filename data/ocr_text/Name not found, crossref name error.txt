Abstract

Motivation: Backbone structures and solvent accessible surface area of proteins are benefited from
continuous real value prediction because it removes the arbitrariness of defining boundary between
different secondary-structure and solvent-accessibility states. However, lacking the confidence score
for predicted values has limited their applications. Here we investigated whether or not we can make
a reasonable prediction of absolute errors for predicted backbone torsion angles, Ca—atom-based
angles and torsion angles, solvent accessibility, contact numbers and half-sphere exposures by em-
ploying deep neural networks.

Results: We found that angle-based errors can be predicted most accurately with Spearman correla-
tion coefficient (SPC) between predicted and actual errors at about 0.6. This is followed by solvent
accessibility (SPC~O.5). The errors on contact-based structural properties are most difficult to predict
(SPC between 0.2 and 0.3). We showed that predicted errors are significantly better error indicators
than the average errors based on secondary-structure and amino-acid residue types. We further
demonstrated the usefulness of predicted errors in model quality assessment. These error or confi-
dence indictors are expected to be useful for prediction, assessment, and refinement of protein struc-
tures.

1 Introduction

Predicting 3-dimensional structures directly from protein sequences
without employing homologous structures as templates remains an un-
solved problem although substantial progresses have been made(Dill and
MacCallum, 2012; Tai, et al., 2014; Zhou, et al., 2011). Meanwhile,
many machine-leaming—based methods have been developed for the
easier problems: sequence-based prediction of one-dimensional or two-

dimensional structural properties such as secondary structures, backbone
torsion angles, solvent accessible surface area, and contact maps(Ali, et
al., 2014; Kurgan, et al., 2008; Kurgan and Disfani, 2011; Singh, et al.,
2014; Zhou and Faraggi, 2010). These predicted structural properties
have been employed as restraints for three-dimensional structure predic-
tion (Dill and MacCallum, 2012; Tai, et al., 2014; Zhou, et al., 2011). As
more protein structures are experimentally determined and machine-
leaming techniques become increasingly more powerful, the prediction

accuracy for these structural properties continues to improve(Eickholt
and Cheng, 2012; Heffeman, et al., 2015; Wang, et al., 2016). One no-
ticeable trend in these predictions is the move from classiﬁcation of
discrete states such as solvent accessibility states (buried or accessible)
and three-state secondary structure to continuous, real values of back-
bone torsion angle and solvent accessible surface area (Zhou and
Faraggi, 2010).

One advantage of real-value prediction is the removal of arbitrariness
in deﬁning the boundary between discrete states. For example, a pre-set
25% accessibility was employed to deﬁne an accessible or buried state
(Kim and Park, 2004; Nguyen and Rajapakse, 2005). Different second-
ary structure assignment techniques can disagree with each other as
much as 15-25% (Colloc'h, et al., 1993; Zhang, et al., 2008) because
there are no well-deﬁned boundaries to separate a non-ideal helical or
strand conformation from a coil conformation. Real-value prediction has
one disadvantage, however. For multi-state classiﬁcations, predicted
actual value for one class can be employed to compute the conﬁdence or
probability score (Jones, 1999). However, predicted real values do not
have corresponding conﬁdence scores. Without conﬁdence scores, the
usefulness of predicted structural properties as restrains for three-
dimensional structure prediction is limited (F araggi, et al., 2009).

The objective of this paper is to examine whether or not conﬁdence
scores for predicted real values of protein structural properties are pre-
dictable in a reasonable accuracy. Recently, we have developed a method
called SPIDER2 that provides accurate real-value prediction of backbone
torsion angles, Cu—atom—based angles and torsion angles, solvent acces-
sibility, contact numbers and half-sphere exposure (Heffeman, et al.,
2016; Lyons, et al., 2014). Here we developed a corresponding method
called SPIDER-Delta to predict the conﬁdence of those predicted struc-
tural properties. We found that predicted errors for angles are highly
correlated with actual angle errors while errors for contact-based struc-
tural properties are more difﬁcult to predict.

2 Methods and Materials

Datasets: To avoid the over-training, we employed exactly the same
datasets employed for training and test of SPIDER2 (Heffeman, et al.,
2015; Lyons, et al., 2014). This dataset contains 5789 proteins with
sequence identity less than 25% and X—ray resolution better than 2A, in
which 4590 proteins are employed as training and cross validation
(TR4590) and 1199 proteins as an independent test dataset (TSll99).
SPIDER was also tested by the targets from critical assessment of struc-
ture prediction technique (CASPl 1, h_t‘rL//
wwwpredictioncentercrg/cM). This independent test set (CASP11)
contains 72 proteins after removing redundancy within CASP targets and
to TR4590 and T81 199 with a sequence identity cutoff of 30%.

To demonstrate the usefulness of predicted errors, we downloaded all
top 1 models predicted by servers for 72 proteins in CASP11 (a total of
3017 models, CASP11MOD). The local structural quality of each model
is evaluated by sequence-p0sition-dependent S-score (Ray, et al., 2012).
Si=1/(1+(di/do)2, where d0=3/i, di is the distance between the residue 1’ in
the model structure and the same residue in the native structure after
pairwise structural alignment by SPalign(Yang, et al., 2012).

 

Deep neural-network architecture: We employed the deep neural
network implemented by Palm (Palm, 2012) to build the model for pre-
dicting the conﬁdence of predicted structural properties. The unsuper-
vised weights were initialized by stacked sparse auto-encoder with learn-
ing rate of 0.05. Then the weights were further reﬁned by standard
backward propagation. The neural networks consist of three hidden

layers, with 150 hidden neurons in each layer. The learning rates for
different layers are 1.0, 0.5, 0.2, and 0.05, respectively. The ﬂowchart of
deep neural networks is show in Fig. 1.

Fig. 1. Flowchart of deep neural networks. The input layer consists of
266 features (sequence proﬁles from PSI-BLAST and predicted structur-
al properties by SPIDER2). There are three hidden layers, each of which
has 150 neurons. The output layer contains predicted absolute deviations
of 12 predicted structural properties ﬁom their actual values.

Input features: A total of 38 input features for a given amino acid resi-
due are made of predicted structural properties from SPIDER2 (18 fea-
tures) and Position Speciﬁc Scoring Matrix (PSSM) generated by PSI-
BLAST(Altschul, et al., 1997) with three iterations of searching against
NR database with an E-value of 0.001 (20 features). Predicted structural
properties ﬁom SPIDER2 include probabilities for three types of sec-
ondary structure (3 features), relative solvent accessibility (RSA) (1
feature), cosine/sine functions of backbone (p and w angles and Cor-atom-
based angle 0 and rotational angle 1: (2*4=8 features), contact numbers
based on Ca and CB atoms (CNu and CNB, 2 features), respectively, and
up and down half-sphere exposures (HSE) based on the Cor-CB vector
and the Cu—CuDvector (HSEB-up, HSEB-down, HSEu—up, and HSEu—
down, 4 features), respectively. Here, (p and w angles are the rotational
angles about the N-Cu bond and the Cor-C bond, respectively. 0i for
residue 1’ is the angle between Cai_1-Cui-Cui+1 and Ti is the angle rotated
about the Cog-Cum bond. Contact numbers (CNu and CNB) are number
of residues within 13A of a residue’s Cu or C0 atom, respectively. HSE
is the residue-residue contact number in upper or down half sphere ac-
cording to a pre-speciﬁed vector (the Cor-CB vector or the Cor-
CuDvector) (Hamelryck, 2005). We also used a sliding window size of 7
(3 amino acids at each side of the query amino acid residue) to represent
each residue. This leads to 266 input features for per residue as shown in
Fig. 1.

Outputs: We are aiming to predict absolute errors between predicted and
measured structural properties for twelve predicted structural properties
(ASS, A(p, Aw, A0, A1, ARSA, ACNu, ACNB, AHSEB-up, AHSEB-down,
AHSEu-up, and AHSEu—down). ASS is an error indicator of predicted
secondary structure. ASS=1, if the predicted secondary structure is the
same as the actual secondary structure according to three-state predic-
tion, and 0 otherwise. A0= |0P‘ed-0E"pt|. For rotational angles (p, w, and 1:,
the smaller value of |AngleP‘6d-AngleE"pt| or 360°-|AngleP‘ed-AngleExpt| is
employed as the prediction target to account for the angle periodicity.
ARSA is the absolute difference between predicted and actual relative
solvent accessibility. Similarly, ACNu, ACNB, AHSEB-up, AHSEB-
down, AHSEu—up, and AHSEu—down are absolute errors in contact num-
bers and half sphere exposures, respectively. There are a total of 12
outputs.

Training, test and performance evaluation. The neural network model
was trained by ten-fold cross validation with TR4590 and independently
tested by TSl 199 and CASP11. In ten-fold cross validation, the training
dataset was randomly divided into ten subsets. Nine subsets were em-
ployed for training and the remaining one subset was for test. This pro-
cess repeated ten times so that all subsets were employed for test. The
performance for ASS was evaluated by the area under the receiver oper-
ating characteristic curve (AUC). All other predicted errors were evalu-
ated by the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC), Spearman correlation
coefﬁcient (SPC) and the mean absolute error (MAE) between predicted
and actual errors.

Model Quality Assessment. To evaluate model quality using predicted
errors, we obtained the number of residues with actual (A We”) and pre-
dicted errors (A Vp’ed) for each variable V, N (A V”, A Vp’ed), based on the
results from 10-fold cross validation on the TR4590 set. A Vwere divided

into 18 bins from minimal to maximal values (1’, j=1,...,18) for four
torsion angles (me=18) and 20 bins (me=20) for other structural proper-
ties. An energy score is calculated by E,-,-=log(P,-,- *me) where Pij=N(i,j)/
ZN (1,1). Then, for each model structure, we can obtain 1) A Vp’ed from our
method for each sequence position m, 2) AV” by using predicted V
ﬁom SPIDER2 and assuming actual V from the model structure for each
sequence position, 3) a sequence-position dependent energy score E,-,-(m)
according the (i, ]) bins that A We” and A Vp’ed belong to and 4) the aver-
age of the neighboring energy scores with a window size of 7
(qm=ZkE(k+m)/7,k=-3,-2,-1,0, 1,2,3). This window-based q-score is used
to calculate the correlation to the actual local structural quality S-score
deﬁned above. Here q-score can be evaluated for 11 predicted errors,
separately, except discrete secondary structures.

3 Results

Table 1 summarizes the performance of error prediction by ten-fold
cross validation and independent tests. Predicted absolute errors for all
angles (Aq), A11!, A0, and A1) have a strong correlation with actual angle
errors. Correlation coefﬁcients in ten-fold cross validation are between
0.52 to 0.56 for PCC and between 0.59 to 0.66 for SPC with low stand-
ard deviation between 10 folds. MAE values range from 4° for A0, 12°
for Aq), 20° for A1}! to 21° for A1. These MAE values for different angle
errors follow the same trend as the MAE values for angles given by
SPIDER (8° for 0, 19° for (p, 30° for 11! and 32° for t). A much higher
SPC than PCC values for all angle errors indicate nonlinear relations
between predicted and actual errors.

The performance of error prediction for RSA is lower than those of
angle errors with PCC at 0.46 and SPC at 0.48. This is followed by the
upper half-sphere contacts (AHSEu-up and AHSEB-up) with PCC at
0.35, contact numbers (ACNu and ACNB) with PCC at 0.30, and down
half-sphere contacts (AHSEB-down and AHSEor-down) with PCC at 0.29
and 0.26, respectively. That is, errors in contact numbers are the most
difﬁcult to predict.

Table 1 further shows that there is essentially no difference in per-
formance between ten-fold cross-validation by TR4590 and independent
test by TS1 199. This highlights the robustness of the method developed.
Slightly worse performance was observed for the CASP 11 set
(CASP11), conﬁrming that the CASP targets are more challenging to
predict as shown previously(Heffeman, et al., 2016; Heffeman, et al.,
2015; Lyons, et al., 2014).

We also predicted the probability that the predicted secondary struc-
ture is the same as the actual secondary structure (ASS). We found that
the area under the curve is 0.832 for ten-fold cross-validation, 0.818 for
TSll99, and 0.799 for CASP11. The ROC curves are show in supple-
ment Fig. Sl. Again, the performance for ten-fold cross validation on
TR4590 is nearly identical to that for independent test on TSl 199, high-
lighting the robustness of the method obtained. We employed predicted
secondary structure probabilities given by SPIDER2 directly. The result-
ing AUC values are 0.807 for TSll99 and 0.800 for CASP11, respec-
tively. This suggests that ASS provide marginal improvement from the
original secondary structure probability from SPIDER2 for the large test
set TS1 199.

To evaluate the usefulness of predicted errors as a conﬁdence score,
we sort all amino acid residues in T81 199 according to predicted errors
in increasing order along with their corresponding actual error values.
Then we calculate average actual errors for top 1%, 2%, ..., 99% and

100% of the sorted residues. As an example, results for A0 and A1 are
shown in Fig. 2. The average actual errors monotonically increase ac-
cording to sorted predicted errors, consistent with strong positive correla-
tion (PCC~0.5 and SPC~0.6) between predicted and actual errors for A0
and AT. One can also estimate the prediction errors according to residue
type, secondary structure type or both. This can be done by obtaining the
average actual errors for 20 amino acid types, predicted three secondary
structure types and secondary—structure-dependent amino acid types (60
values) along with the cumulative percentages of residues covered by
these categories sorted according to average actual errors. As Fig. 2
shows, predicted errors (black line) are signiﬁcantly better in separating
those residues with highly accurate angles (low actual errors) from poor-
ly predicted angles (high actual errors) and thus are more reliable conﬁ-
dence indicators than residue and secondary-structure-based classiﬁca-
tions. Similar results are observed for other structural properties (Aq),
A111, ARSA, ACNu, ACNB, AHSEB-up, AHSEB-down, AHSEor-up, and
AHSEor-down) shown in Supplement Fig. S2A-H.

Similarly, the average accuracy of predicted secondary structures can
be plotted as the cumulative percentage from 1% to 100% of residues
sorted according to predicted probabilities of errors in secondary struc-
tures (ASS) or according to predicted secondary structure probability by
SPIDER2. As shown in supplement Fig. S3, the performance of ASS is
only marginally better than that of predicted secondary structure proba-
bility by SPIDER2 by identifying higher percent of accurately predicted
residues.

Fig. 3A and 3B show two-dimensional heatmaps in secondary struc-
ture type (C for coil, E for sheet, H for helix) and amino acid type in
single letter code for A0 and AT, respectively. Angle errors in helical
residues are accurately predicted regardless the type of amino acid resi-
due. The highest errors in A0 and AT interestingly are glycine (G) in

cine (G) and tryptophan ON) in coil conformation, respectively.

As an example, Fig. 4 compared predicted and actual Cor-based tor-
sion angle A1 for zinc protease from actinobacteria Streptomyces caespi—

cording to predicted and actual A1: in Fig. 4A and 4B, respectively. The-
se All values are also shown as a ﬁmction of residue index in Fig. 4C.
The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between predicted and actual values
is 0.56, which is the same as the overall PCC value on TSll99. Con-
sistent with high correlations, our predicted AT captures highly accurate
(blue) areas reasonably well but with under-predicted A1: for largest
errors in coil regions, in particular. This is largely due to inability of our
neural network methods to predict largest errors (extreme values).

To examine the usefulness of predicted errors in assessing model
quality, we calculated q-scores for 11 predicted errors and their correla-
tions with actual model quality S-scores on the CASP11MOD dataset.
We found that PCC is the strongest (0.46) for A1: and between 0.33 and
0.44 for ACNu (0.33), ACNB (0.33), AHSEu—down (0.35), AHSEB-down
(0.35), Acp (0.37), AHSEB-up (0.40), AHSEu-up (0.40), A0 (0.40), A1|I
(0.44). The weakest correlation was observed for ARSA (0.19). The
statistically signiﬁcant correlation (p-value<2.2><10'16) for all predicted
errors conﬁrmed the usefulness of these variables as novel features for
quality assessment.

4 Discussion

We have developed a method called SPIDER-Delta dedicated to predic-
tion of the errors of predicted real-value structural properties include
backbone torsion angles, Cor-based angles and torsion angles, solvent
accessible surface area and contact numbers. The method has the best
performance for angles with SPC about 0.6 between predicted and actual
values, followed by relative ASA (SPC about 0.5) for ten-fold cross
validation (TR4590) and independent test (TSl 199). However, the errors
for contact numbers are not as accurately predicted (SPC at 0.2-0.3).
Predicted errors in secondary structures only provide marginal improve-
ment over the direct use of predicted secondary structure probability.
The performance of the method is robust as the results of ten-fold cross
validation are essentially the same as the results of the large independent
test (TSl 199).

It is of interest to know the importance of various features in error
prediction. There are a total of 266 features based on 20 PSSM and 18
predicted structural properties and a sliding window size of 7 residues.
However, it is computationally infeasible to examine 266 features indi-
vidually with nearly one million amino acid residues in the training set
for deep neutral networks. Thus, we investigated the performance of
features according to different groups (secondary structure probability
(SS), relative solvent accessibility (RSA), angles (Angles), contact num-
ber and half sphere exposure (HSE), and position speciﬁc scoring matrix

(PSSM)). We evaluated the impact of removing one group at a time on

the average of mean absolute errors of 12 target values (Aq), A11!, A0, A15,
ARSA, ASS, AHSEor-up, AHSEB-up, ACNor, ACNB, AHSEB-down,
AHSEor-down) based on 10-fold cross validation. We found that remov-
ing torsion angles leads to the largest increase in error (3%) but only
minor increases (0.2-0.4%) for other group features, including PSSM.
This is likely due to the fact that all structural properties were predicted
by PSSM. Nevertheless, all features have made statistically signiﬁcant
(p-V31ues<5><10'6), positive contributions in improving prediction of
errors.

We also examined the usefulness of other features in error prediction
by employing the consistency score between various predicted structural
properties. For example, the consistency between predicted Cor-based
angles/torsion angles and those angles calculated from predicted back-
bone torsion angles and the root-mean—squared distance between frag-
ment structures generated from Cor-based angles/torsion angles and those
from backbone torsion angles were found useful as an indicator of accu-
racy of local structures (Lyons, et al., 2014). However, we found that
addition of these two consistency-based features did not lead to further
signiﬁcant improvement in predicted conﬁdence scores.

The above studies were based on deep learning neutral networks. The
large training data (~1 million residues) and 12 outputs prevented us to
test other machine-leaming techniques. For example, SVM would be
computationally too slow to train and test. Moreover, many previous
studies have concluded that deep neural networks are superior to SVM,
regular neural network (NN) and other models in learning from large
data sets(Bengio, et al., 2013).

The predicted errors, however, should be employed as a conﬁdence or
probability score for a predicted structural property, rather than directly
utilized as the absolute error of the given structural property. This is true
even for most accurately predicted angle errors. As illustrated in Fig. 4,
although predicted errors are highly correlated to actual errors, predicted
values are systematically smaller than actual values for largest errors in
particular. This is because of the inherent difﬁculty of machine-leaming
methods to predict extreme values (F araggi, et al., 2009). Our future
study will investigate if building a dedicated predictor for predicted coil
residues will enhance the ability to predict large errors because most
large errors are belong to coil residues. Separate treatment of helix,
sheet, and coil in an ensemble learning was shown important for improv-
ing prediction of mutation-induced changes in protein stability
(Folkrnan, et al., 2016).

Despite this limitation, Fig. 2 shows that predicted errors are a much
better indicator than the error indicated based on the average errors ac-
cording to predicted secondary structures and amino-acid residue types.
The latter was employed to demonstrate that real-value predicted torsion
angles are more useful as restraints than three-state secondary structure
types in fragment-free protein structure prediction (F araggi, et al., 2009).
Thus, we expect that predicted errors are more useful as restraints for
protein structure prediction. Similarly, in template-based techniques such
as SPARKS X (Yang, et al., 2011), matching template structural proper-
ties with predicted properties based on estimated errors has improved the
ability of recognizing correct structural folds. More accurately predicted
errors will be likely useful to further improve fold recognition.

To directly test the usefulness of predicted errors, we employed them
as model quality assessment scores by calculating q-scores from predict-
ed errors. For most predicted errors, predicted q-scores have a statistical-
ly signiﬁcant correlation to actual local structure-quality S-scores with
the highest PCC value at 0.46 for a single feature of AT. This suggests

that predicted errors are potentially useﬁil new features for further im-
proving existing methods for model assessment.

SPIDER-Delta obtained here is available at http://sparks-labcrg as a
part of the SPIDER2 structure-property-prediction package. Because we
are predicting the error bound for a predicted value, it is inevitable for
our method to be tied with a speciﬁc predictor to obtain the predicted
value (in our case SPIDER2). If one wants to avoid this dependence on a
speciﬁc predictor, it is necessary to employ multiple predictors and make
prediction of the average errors of these multiple predictors. A method
like this would reveal the regions whose structural properties such as
backbone angles that are most difﬁcult to predict for any methods. This
is an interesting subject deserving further studies.

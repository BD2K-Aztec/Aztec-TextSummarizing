ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recent advances in high-throughput lipid profiling by
liquid chromatography electrospray ionization tandem mass spec-
trometry (LC-ESI-MS/MS) have made it possible to quantify hundreds
of individual molecular lipid species (e.g. fatty acyls, glycerolipids,
glycerophospholipids, sphingolipids) in a single experimental run for
hundreds of samples. This enables the lipidome of large cohorts of
subjects to be profiled to identify lipid biomarkers significantly asso-
ciated with disease risk, progression and treatment response.
Clinically, these lipid biomarkers can be used to construct classifica-
tion models for the purpose of disease screening or diagnosis.
However, the inclusion of a large number of highly correlated bio-
markers within a model may reduce classification performance, un-
necessarily inflate associated costs of a diagnosis or a screen and
reduce the feasibility of clinical translation. An unsupervised feature
reduction approach can reduce feature redundancy in lipidomic bio-
markers by limiting the number of highly correlated lipids while retain-
ing informative features to achieve good classification performance for
various clinical outcomes. Good predictive models based on a
reduced number of biomarkers are also more cost effective and feas-
ible from a clinical translation perspective.

Results: The application of LICRE to various lipidomic datasets in
diabetes and cardiovascular disease demonstrated superior discrim-
ination in terms of the area under the receiver operator characteristic
curve while using fewer lipid markers when predicting various clinical
outcomes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Supervised feature reduction approaches have commonly been
used in genomics to improve computational efﬁciency and clas-
siﬁcation performance. For instance, Wong et al. (2012) demon-
strated that the omission of uninformative single nucleotide
polymorphism (SNP) microarray-derived copy number measure-
ments improved both the classiﬁcation performance of various

cancer subtypes and overall computational efﬁciency. In the con-
text of SNPs, uninformative features may constitute probesets
with probe sequences matching multiple genomic loci Wong
et al., 2010) giving rise to cross-hybridization and spurious
copy number measurements. In lipidomics, lipid species experi-
mentally analysed tend to be highly correlated because of simila-
rities in their chemical properties (e. g. lipids that are co-regulated
or members of a common metabolic pathway). Thus, feature
reduction to minimize the number of correlated lipids in the
dataset can be useful to ensure good classiﬁcation performance
by using a limited set of non-redundant but informative features.
The advantage of an unsupervised feature reduction approach is
that the reduction is not biased towards any sample or outcome
classiﬁcation, and a single reduced dataset can be used for the
analysis of multiple outcomes. The use of a limited number of
markers also enhances the feasibility for potential translation in a
clinical setting for disease risk prediction, diagnosis, prognosis
and prediction/monitoring of therapeutic response.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

LICRE is an algorithm that reduces the number of highly correlated lipid
species in a lipidomic dataset without the need for sample class informa-
tion. This allows the reduced dataset to be analysed for various outcomes.
Our work is motivated by our observation that highly correlated lipid
species tend to be members of the same lipid class, i.e. have similar chem-
ical properties and structure or belong to a common metabolic or regu-
latory pathway. Consequently, the down— or upregulation of these related
lipid species can be readily inferred from each other. Unlike other un-
supervised methods, e.g. principal components analysis (PCA), the inter-
pretation of the abstracted set of features in LICRE is straightforward, as
the original meaning of each feature (lipid) is preserved. In contrast, the
principal components in PCA are weighted linear combinations of the
original features, which makes their biological interpretation difﬁcult. We
have implemented LICRE in MATLAB 2013a as a function that can be
applied in the initial pre-processing stage of classiﬁcation modelling. The
challenges presented by this task are: (i) estimating the degree (extent) of
correlation of lipids in a dataset, (ii) identifying groups/clusters of lipids
(features) that are sufﬁciently correlated in the dataset, (iii) abstracting
each group/cluster of highly correlated lipids with minimal loss of
information.

Estimating degree of correlation. To estimate the degree of correlation
in the dataset, we create a minimalist network representation of the cor-
relation structure of the data by constructing a maximum spanning tree
(MAST) using visual assessment of cluster tendency (VAT) (Bezdek and
Hathaway, 2002). VAT is a visual approach used to determine the
number of natural clusters in a dataset. Given a correlation matrix of
the data, the number of clusters k can identiﬁed if an ordering of the rows
and columns can be found that results in a sequence of dense diagonal

blocks in the rearranged matrix. Each block represents high correlation
among its corresponding points and deﬁnes a cluster. VAT attempts to
discover this ordering by constructing a MAST through all points. In this
context, a point is a feature (i.e. a particular lipid species), and the cor-
relation matrix represents all pairwise linear correlation coefﬁcients be-
tween features. Starting from the outer edges of a cluster, MAST
traversal with VAT will likely visit all nodes in the cluster then cross to
the nearest cluster in correlation terms and traverse the nodes within that
cluster. Hence, the intra-cluster pairwise correlations are high and the
inter-cluster correlation is low. A histogram [bin widths determined by
the Freedman—Diaconis rule (Freedman and Diaconis, 1981)] of the cor-
relation coefﬁcients corresponding to the edges of the MAST gives us an
estimate of the degree of correlation in the dataset. The distribution ob-
tained is typically multi—modal (Fig. 1, Step 4).

Identifying threshold of correlation. From the histogram, a cutoff
threshold can be identiﬁed that delineates higher correlation coefﬁcients
from lower correlation coefﬁcients. This enables us to identify clusters of
lipids that are sufﬁciently correlated in the dataset. To determine this
threshold, we apply soft means shift clustering (SMSC) (Little and
Jones, 2011) to approximate the histogram by discovering levels
(Fig. 1, Step 5) in the histogram. The approximation of the histogram
allows us to identify breaks between modes in the histogram and potential
candidate thresholds of sufﬁcient correlation in the dataset. SMSC is
similar to k-means clustering where each level may be considered the
equivalent of a centroid in k-means clustering and assigns points in the
histogram to the closest level (centroid). Unlike k-means, SMSC auto-
matically ﬁnds the number of levels required. Candidate thresholds are

identiﬁed discrete levels. The highest ranked threshold is selected. The
selected threshold delineates a cluster or clusters of high correlation co-
efﬁcients from the mass of lower correlation coefﬁcients. Feature pairs
that have correlation coefﬁcients beyond this threshold are targets for
feature reduction in the next stage of LICRE—feature pruning.

Feature pruning. A relevance network is constructed where an edge
between nodes exists if its correlation coefﬁcient exceeds the threshold
determined from SMSC. To begin, the mean correlation coefﬁcient of all
clusters of degree one in the relevance network is computed. The centroid
of the cluster with the highest mean correlation is retained, and all its
peers are deleted. This is repeated recursively for the cluster with the next
highest mean correlation in the residual network until singletons or pairs
of nodes remain in the network. All unlinked nodes (singletons) are re-
tained as features. For exclusive node pairs, the node with the highest
median measurement (easy to quantify) is retained while the other is
deleted. The set of nodes retained form the reduced dataset that replaces
the complete dataset for classiﬁcation modelling or statistical analysis.

3 CONCLUSION

We have developed an unsupervised feature reduction approach
for lipidomic data. The application of LICRE on clinical lipido-
mic datasets (see Supplementary Material) demonstrates a stat-
istically signiﬁcant improvement in area under the ROC curve
that is achieved with the use of a reduced number of features.
This suggests potential utility in identifying concise markers for
risk prediction, diagnostic, prognostic models of disease and for
monitoring therapeutic response.

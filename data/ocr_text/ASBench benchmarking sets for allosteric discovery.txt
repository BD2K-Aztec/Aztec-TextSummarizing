Abstract

Summary: Allostery allows for the fine—tuning of protein function. Targeting allosteric sites is
gaining increasing recognition as a novel strategy in drug design. The key challenge in the discov—
ery of allosteric sites has strongly motivated the development of computational methods and thus
high—quality, publicly accessible standard data have become indispensable. Here, we report
benchmarking data for experimentally determined allosteric sites through a complex process,
including a ‘Core set’ with 235 unique allosteric sites and a ‘Core—Diversity set’ with 147 structurally
diverse allosteric sites. These benchmarking sets can be exploited to develop efficient computa—
tional methods to predict unknown allosteric sites in proteins and reveal unique allosteric

ligand—protein interactions to guide allosteric drug design.

1 Introduction

Allostery is a major regulatory mechanism that is of fundamental
importance in a wide variety of biological phenomena. The propaga—
tion of allosteric signals from allosteric sites induced by effectors
binding to different, often distant, functional sites allows for exquis—
ite control of protein functional activity (Nussinov and Tsai, 2013).
The structural diversity of allosteric sites endows allosteric effectors
with the benefits of higher selectivity and lower toxicity. Targeting
allosteric sites, as a novel tactic in drug design, has therefore
prompted intense interest in the development of allosteric drugs
(Lu et al., 2014a).

Despite the enticing advantages of allosteric regulation, mod—
ern allosteric drug discovery faces considerable challenges. In par—
ticular, the vast majority of allosteric sites in proteins are as—yet
undiscovered as a result of the difficulty in identifying such sites
experimentally. This difficulty has led to a paucity of structural and
mechanistic insights into the characterization of allosteric sites, and

it has also impeded computational development for the identifica—
tion of allosteric sites (Lu et 61]., 2014b). To address this issue, we
recently constructed the Allosteric Database (ASD; Huang et 61].,
2014), which is a collection of experimentally determined allosteric
proteins, and modulators to provide a platform for the application
and discovery of allosteric sites. Nevertheless, the collection of raw
allosteric sites suffers from redundancy and the inclusion of low
quality sites. It is therefore imperative to offer a more stringent set
of allosteric sites for the development of viable computational
approaches for allosteric site prediction and to reveal the unique
characteristics of allosteric ligand—protein interactions for drug
design.

To this end, two benchmarking sets of allosteric sites were com—
piled through a complex process, designated as a ‘Core set’ and a
‘Core—Diversity set’. The former totally contains 235 unique allo—
steric site, and the latter encompasses 147 structurally diverse
allosteric sites. These high—quality benchmarking sets can be

exploited to develop computational approaches to predict the loca-
tion of as-yet-unknown allosteric sites in proteins (Huang et al.
2013; Panjkovich and Daura, 2014), and they contain representative
specific allosteric ligand—protein interactions that can guide struc-
ture-based allosteric drug discovery.

2 Methods

The latest version of ASD (v2.0, July 2014), containing 1743 experi-
mentally determined allosteric complexes, was used to develop the
benchmarking sets of allosteric sites. A set of rules was applied to se-
lect the qualified allosteric sites and remove site redundancy, yield-
ing the ‘Core set’ composed of 235 representative complexes for
allosteric sites (Supplementary Table S1). Subsequently, the struc-
tural similarity of the allosteric sites in the ‘Core set’ was assessed,
and 147 structural complexes with diverse allosteric sites were fur-
ther extracted to constitute the ‘Core-Diversity set’ (Supplementary
Table S2). Both datasets are deposited in ASBench. Detailed infor-
mation about the process is provided in the ‘Materials and Methods’
of Supplementary Information.

3 Results

3.1 Benchmarking sets

The ‘Core set’ in ASBench includes 235 unique allosteric sites, which
are most frequently found in bacteria and humans (Supplementary
Fig. Sl) and are primarily distributed in several classes of proteins,

such as transferases (35%), hydrolases (15%), oxidoreductases
(9%) and transcription factors (8%) (Fig. 1A). The polar solvent-ac-
cessible surface area and the pocket volume of these allosteric sites
are mainly within the range of 10—1500 and 15 0—6500 A3, respect-
ively (Fig. 1B). An analysis of pocket similarity, measured by the
Pocket Similarity score (PS-score), revealed the existence of struc-
tural similarity between several allosteric sites, with the largest PS-
score of 0.976 (Fig. 1C, left). Eliminating the structurally redundant
allosteric sites in the ‘Core set’ yielded 147 diverse allosteric sites
that constitute the ‘Core-Diversity set’, with the largest PS-score of
0.491 (Fig. 1C, right). Interestingly, multiple allosteric sites within
an individual protein are observed in the benchmarking sets
(Supplementary Table S3). For example, four allosteric sites are cur-
rently known in the human glycogen phosphorylase (Fig. 1D). Using
the ‘Core-Diversity set’ of allosteric sites, it is possible to develop ef-
ficient computational models to detect undiscovered allosteric sites
in proteins and subsequently screen or design compounds that target
these pockets. In addition, the pharmacophoric and structural prop-
erties of allosteric sites, coupled with the paradigms of allosteric lig-
and—protein interactions, can be extracted from the ‘Core set’ for
use in pharmaceutical R86D.

3.2 Usage

ASBench provides a variety of interfaces and graphical visualizations
to facilitate the viewing and analysis of allosteric sites in the bench-
marking sets, including structural and pharmacophoric properties.
This tool allows for browsing the sets and provides a search filter

allosteric sites in the benchmarking sets integrated within a panel is

checking the selected site in the panel opens a new browser window
with a detailed view of the representative allosteric complex con—
taining the site. In addition, other complex structures containing the
same site and different allosteric sites within the same protein are
hyperlinked under ‘Related Structures’. Finally, all data in the
benchmarking sets can be downloaded using the ‘Download’ menu

4 Conclusion

The benchmarking sets in ASBench provide the high-quality
data of allosteric sites for the development of efficient computa—
tional methods on the prediction of unknown allosteric sites and the
exploration of unique allosteric ligand—protein interactions. It
is thus expected to provide valuable avenues for allosteric drug
discovery.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Understanding and predicting an individual’s response in
a clinical trial is the key to better treatments and cost-effective medi-
cine. Over the coming years, more and more large-scale omics data-
sets will become available to characterize patients with complex and
heterogeneous diseases at a molecular level. Unfortunately, genetic,
phenotypical and environmental variation is much higher in a human
trial population than currently modeled or measured in most animal
studies. In our experience, this high variability can lead to failure of
trained predictors in independent studies and undermines the cred-
ibility and utility of promising high-dimensional datasets.

Methods: We propose a method that utilizes patient-level genome-
wide expression data in conjunction with causal networks based on
prior knowledge. Our approach determines a differential expression
profile for each patient and uses a Bayesian approach to infer corres-
ponding upstream regulators. These regulators and their correspond-
ing posterior probabilities of activity are used in a regularized
regression framework to predict response.

Results: We validated our approach using two clinically relevant
phenotypes, namely acute rejection in kidney transplantation and re-
sponse to Infliximab in ulcerative colitis. To demonstrate pitfalls in
translating trained predictors across independent trials, we analyze
performance characteristics of our approach as well as alternative
feature sets in the regression on two independent datasets for each
phenotype. We show that the proposed approach is able to success-
fully incorporate causal prior knowledge to give robust performance
estimates.

1 INTRODUCTION

With our increasing understanding of the etiology and hetero-
geneity of complex diseases comes the realization that thera-
peutic drugs might need to be tailored to speciﬁc
subpopulations of patients. Our current inability to predict
such subpopulations has contributed to the rising cost of drug
development and overall health-care expenditure. One aspect of
this problem is the identiﬁcation of patient populations that re-
spond to an experimental drug in a clinical trial. It currently
becomes feasible to generate multi-omics (e.g. transcriptomics,

genetics and metabolomics) datasets for all patients in a clinical
trial of hundreds of people for a cost that is only a small per-
centage of the overall cost of the trial.

Research on Precision Medicine (Mirnezami et al., 2012) has
been particularly strong in oncology as many cancers have a
strong genetic basis to leverage for this purpose. For instance,
the National Cancer Institutes of Health (NCI) in the USA re-
cently outlined their criteria for the use of omics-based predictors
(McShane et al., 2013) in NCI-funded clinical trials. They point
out the pitfalls of deﬁning omics-based predictors that do not
translate well to patient population outside the initial trial, i.e.
the problem of overfitting the available data. As a striking ex-
ample of the care that has to be taken when deﬁning signatures,
Venet et al. (2011) compare 47 published gene-expression signa-
tures for breast cancer. The sobering result is that the majority of
signatures do not perform better than any randomly picked set
of genes of similar size. In our experience, the aspect of replic-
ability in independent datasets has not received enough attention
in the current literature on novel methods. It is relatively easy to
demonstrate the beneﬁts of a method within one well-controlled
study but much harder to show translatability to independent
studies. This problem is especially pronounced in human popu-
lations in which genetic and environmental diversity is much
higher than in animal studies. As this problem has impacted
method adoption for our internal research in several cases, we
tried to explicitly validate ﬁndings in at least two independent
cohorts in each response prediction scenario.

In this article, we focus on human clinical trials with patient-
level genome-wide gene-expression data. Responders to therapy
are identiﬁed at the end of the study using disease-speciﬁc
measures. The question of interest is whether the baseline or
early treatment gene-expression data can predict response to
treatment. There has been substantial prior work on establishing
predictive gene-expression signatures based on data-driven meth-
ods alone as well as by leveraging other types of biological
information. For instance, Tibshirani et al. (2002) proposed the
use of regularization techniques to improve gene selection for
predictive signatures early on. Since then, many authors have
proposed approaches using different machine-learning tech-
niques including regularized regression, SVMs and random for-
ests. Cun and Frohlich (2012) give a recent review. One recent
example that utilizes prior knowledge is the PARADIGM ap-
proach (Vaske et al., 2010) which uses probabilistic models to
integrate genetics, epigenetics and transcriptional data with
curated pathway information to determine active pathways in
cancer patients, but does not directly attempt a prediction of
response and non-response status in trial data.

As a common consensus, most methods employ some form of
regularization to overcome the problem of many variables but
few samples. Furthermore, methods vary in the amount of prior
knowledge they employ—from no prior knowledge at all to a
mixture of different omics technologies as in the case of
PARADIGM. However, most novel methods have not been de-
veloped in the setting of human data with high intrinsic levels of
phenotypic and genetic heterogeneity and are not evaluated in a
truly independent dataset, e.g. a trial conducted at a different
clinic, but exclusively rely on cross-validation approaches.

In contrast, we present a method that attempts to deﬁne bio-
logically interpretable, yet predictive signatures of diseases pro-
gression or response to drug treatment that translate well to new
studies. In conjunction with a well-accepted learning algorithm,
Ll-regularized logistic regression (Friedman et al., 2010), we base
our method on a large collection of causal relationships manually
curated from the literature. The causal graph consists of
~450 000 causal relationships, of which >250 000 are unique,
between ~37 000 entities, representing ~65 000 full-text articles
indexed by PubMed. Each causal relationship describes an ex-
perimentally observed perturbation experiment leading to a
deﬁned transcriptional change. We previously published a
Bayesian inference method on this causal graph that given a
set of differentially expressed genes, is able to identify potential
upstream regulators and their biological context (Zarringhalam
et al., 2013). The method is called Bayesian Causal Reasoning
Engine (Bayes-CRE) and will serve as a building block in this
work. We brieﬂy outline it in Section 2. A prerequisite for the
method to work is that relevant biology is captured in the under-
lying knowledgebase of causal relationships. We found that
Bayes-CRE is able to capture the relevant upstream regulators
in numerous test cases, indicating that the collection of pairwise
causal relations in our network has sufﬁcient level of complexity
to be useful. More large-scale dataset with more complex notion
of causality can also be incorporated into our methodology as
they become available in the future.

The search for suitable experimental datasets has been surpris-
ingly difﬁcult. Our criteria for inclusion were (i) a dataset of at
least 20 human subjects with a deﬁned clinical binary outcome,
i.e. responders and non-responders, (ii) at least some detectable
difference in gene expression at baseline between the two groups
and (iii) the availability of a similar but entirely independent trial
for testing purposes. For the purposes of this work, we settled on
two appropriate datasets: the studies of Khatri et al. (2013) and
Einecke et al. (2010) on acute rejection in kidney transplantation
and the work of Arijs et al. (2009) on inﬁiximab treatment in
ulcerative colitis.

In the following, we will deﬁne the details of our proposed
method, compare its performance against alternative feature sets
and demonstrate that its application can lead to biologically in-
terpretable predictors that are robust to resampling and, most
crucially, seem to translate well to independent patient
populations.

2 METHODS

Conceptually, we require a set of features characterizing each patient in
the clinical trial which can then be utilized by a classiﬁcation algorithm
for prediction. In the following, we will explore using (i) a signiﬁcant set

of normalized gene expression values, (ii) the set of enriched Gene
Ontology (GO) categories (Ashburner et al., 2000) and (iii) signiﬁcant
upstream regulators and their activity scores (Zarringhalam et al., 2013).

2.1 Data processing

We processed gene-expression data from two clinical phenotypes: (i)
acute rejection in kidney transplantation (Khatri et al., 2013; Einecke
et al., 2010) and (ii) response to inﬁiximab in ulcerative colitis (Arijs
et al., 2009). Each phenotype consists of two datasets (GEO accession
numbers GSE50058 and GSE21374 in acute rejection and GSE12251 and
GSE14580 in response to inﬂiximab). Datasets corresponding to different
phenotypes were analyzed separately. For each phenotype, both datasets
were combined and RMA (robust multi-array average) normalized. The
probes that were absent in all samples—irrespective of response status—
were ﬁltered using the masScalls function from the R Bioconductor
package (Gentleman et al., 2004). Differential gene-expression analysis
with FDR cutoff of 0.05 and a fold-change cutoff value of 1.3 was per-
formed on the normalized combined dataset as well as individual datasets
in each phenotype using the R Bioconductor package. This combined
normalization will put all transcript abundance estimates on a similar
scale. Note that this part does not use any information on response
status from either training or test set. Although this combined normal-
ization may have a slight impact on performance estimates as more test
examples are added to the datasets, the performance should be shifted
towards better generalizability to the test set. Moreover, this effect equally
impacts all tested methods presented in this work as they all use the
normalized expression data as a starting point. From a practical point
of view, testing data can always be added to the normalization at test
time, data re-normalized and the classiﬁers re-trained on the training data
alone.

2.2 Generating differential gene-expression proﬁles for
each individual

In order to obtain enriched GO terms as well as upstream regulators, we
need to identify differentially expressed genes per individual. If there are
enough replicates and a healthy control group is available, this can be
achieved by pairwise comparisons of gene values between the individuals
and the controls.

Here, we deﬁne differential expression relative to response status of the
individual. For example, a gene for a responder is called differentially
expressed if it is signiﬁcantly different from the distribution of gene-
expression values in non-responders. More speciﬁcally let Mg, Mg] and
0;, 0:] denote the mean and standard deviation of normalized gene
values for gene g among the responders and non-responders, respectively.
If the individual is a responder, the Z—score proﬁle is zg = (xg — MES/0:]
where xg is the normalized gene value of gene g. If the individual is a non-
responder, the Z—proﬁle is then zg = (xg — Mg)/0‘g. Note that the response
status of the individuals in the training set is known and hence the op-
posite group can be identiﬁed. The genes with large Z—score values in the
absolute value sense are then declared as differentially expressed. Based
on the sign of the Z—scores, we determine the up or down regulation of
the gene (up regulated if the Z—score is positive and down regulated if the
Z—score is negative). It should be noted that in assigning signiﬁcance to
per-individual gene values, we are making an implicit assumption that 2g
approximately follows a standard normal distribution. This practical ap-
proximation enables us to assess how far a gene value falls from the mean
of the distribution and hence generate the proﬁles of differentially ex-
pressed genes per-individual. If extra information (e. g. more replicates per
patient or an independent control group) is available, the signiﬁcance of
gene values can be estimated using more direct approaches (such as a
standard t—test).

For a new individual or an individual in a test set, the response status is
not known a priori. In this case, we have to compute two z-proﬁles

obtained by comparisons with both groups (Fig. 1). The z-proﬁle ob-
tained from the opposite group of the true status of the new individual,
will be a ‘correct’ z—proﬁle containing potentially important gene differ-
ences that are linked to response. The other z-proﬁle will contain
‘random’ differences of the individual with the rest of the individuals in
the same group. Correspondingly, we have two sets of differentially ex-
pressed genes. We use an absolute value Z—score cutoff of 2 throughout
this work.

2.3 Feature sets

In the following, we will deﬁne ﬁve types of feature sets of increasing
complexity. In the training phase, a subset of features will be selected by
the classiﬁer and only those will be used for prediction. For instance, this
corresponds to a subset of differentially expressed genes or a subset of
potential upstream regulators. Note that all feature sets that use per-
individual differentially expressed genes at prediction time will require
two feature proﬁles assuming, ﬁrst, that the test subject is a responder
and then that the subject is a non-responder based on the procedure
outlined above. Our main feature set is Feature Set IV. Prediction accur-
acy of the feature sets will be discussed in Section 3. Table 1 gives an
overview.

2.3.] Feature Set I: gene-expression values The simplest feature set
relies on the normalized expression values only and reﬂects commonly
used practice when no additional prior knowledge is available. We deﬁne
two subtypes, namely normalized gene values of top 10 differentially ex-
pressed genes according to P-value (Feature Set Ia or T OPIO) and (2)
normalized gene values of all differentially expressed genes (Feature Set
lb or ALL).

2.3.2 Feature Set II: gene Z—scores Feature Set II also does not use
any prior knowledge, but tries to exploit differences of individual patients
better. At training time, all ‘correct’ individual level Z—score proﬁles and
corresponding differentially expressed genes per individual are computed
(Fig. 1). The union of these differentially expressed genes constitutes
Feature Set II. In contrast to Feature Set I, the computed Z—scores of,
say, a responder contains information as to how differentially each gene is

expressed with respect to the non-responder group and not only normal-
ized expression values.

2.3.3 Feature Set III: enriched G0 categories or G0 terms GO
terms are a commonly used form of prior biological knowledge. Each GO
terms is a collection of genes labeled with a speciﬁc biologically mean-
ingful term, such as ‘insulin receptor signaling pathway (GO:0008286)’.
Feature Set III tries to explore the encoded knowledge to improve
response prediction. To determine signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms, we
performed enrichment analysis using the TopGO R package (Alexa et al.,
2006) on each individual’s differentially expressed genes at training time.
The union of all GO terms with a P—value <10’ 6 forms Feature Set III.
We use the logarithm of the enrichment P—value as features.

2.3.4 Feature Set I V: significant upstream regulators or Bayes-
CRE Finally, we deﬁne a feature set that incorporates relevant up-
stream regulators of downstream gene expression changes. In
Zarringhalam et al. (2013), we introduced a Bayesian framework to iden-
tify potential upstream regulators and their biological context. The net-
work relies on causal statements extracted from peer-reviewed PubMed

full papers. These causal statements can be used to construct a signed
causal graph in which the set of nodes consists of transcripts, proteins, or
compounds. A directed edge between nodes indicates the existence of a
causal relation between the source and the target nodes while the sign of
the edge speciﬁes the direction of regulation. For transcriptomics data-
sets, we are mostly interested in molecular perturbations leading to tran-
scriptional changes.

From this causal graph a Bayesian network is constructed. The net-
work consists of several layers (Fig. 2). The ﬁrst layer of the network
consists of transcript nodes representing observed differentially expressed
genes. To account for the noise in gene-expression data, we introduced a
second layer of nodes, called true state nodes that are directly above the
transcript nodes reﬂecting the true state of regulation independent of
measurement noise. The next layer of nodes in the network consists of
regulators. These are the proteins and compounds in the causal network
that potentially regulate the transcripts. The regulator nodes are causally
linked to the true state nodes as determined by the causal graph. In order
to account for conditions under which the causal relations are relevant,
we introduced two additional layers of nodes. For each causal relation in
the network, an applicability node was deﬁned which is directly connected
to the true state node of the corresponding causal relation. Each causal
relation is annotated with the PubMed id of the article reporting the
causal relation which in turn is annotated with MeSH (Medical Subject
Headings) terms. These MeSH terms, e.g. ‘adipogenesis’ or ‘JAK/STAT
signaling cascade’ provide additional biological context and are intro-
duced as context nodes in the network. Context nodes are connected to
applicability node of their corresponding causal relation.

Based on this network topology, we deﬁned a conditional probability
distribution and used a Gibbs-sampling algorithm to query the network
and infer upstream regulators, i.e. regulator nodes with high posterior
probability given the observed differential gene-expression data. In sum-
mary, the input of the inference algorithm are the differentially expressed
genes between two conditions and their corresponding direction of regu-
lation (up or down) and the output is the posterior probabilities of regu-
lators, applicability of edges and the contexts with their MeSH terms.
More details can be found in Zarringhalam et al. (2013).

Feature Set IV is deﬁned as the union of all signiﬁcant upstream regu-
lators, i.e. posterior probability >0.4, uncovered for each individual’s
differentially expressed genes at training time. The posterior probabilities
of regulators constitute the features.

2.4 Predicting response via regularized regression

Given any of the input feature sets, we use an Ll-regularized logistic
regression approach to train a binary classiﬁer using the R glmnet pack-
age (Friedman et al., 2010). In case of Feature Sets 11, III and IV

(Z—scores, Go-terms and Bayes-CRE), the ‘correct’ proﬁle is known
during training and used to train the classiﬁer. For a prediction in the
testing phase, features derived from both z—proﬁles are used and two
predictions are made, one for each proﬁle. Each prediction is given a
probability by the classiﬁer. If the class predictions are czl and czz with
probabilities p21 and p22 for the two proﬁles, a ﬁnal decision on class label
is made using the following decision function: f(i) = czl if p21 >p22 and
f(i) = czz if p22>p21, where i indicated the individual for whom the pre-
diction is made. Algorithm 1 summarizes the approach.

2.5 Validation within the dataset: cross validation

We assessed the accuracy of the feature sets by performing a leave-one-
out cross validation. In case of Feature Set I, the i—th example was taken
out from the dataset and the classiﬁer was trained on the features from
the remaining individuals in the set. A prediction was then made on the
class label of the i—th individual. In case of Feature Sets II, III and IV, the
i—th example was taken out from the dataset and the classiﬁer was trained
on the features from the remaining individuals in the set. As response
status for the i—th individual is unknown to the classiﬁer, two predictions
were made for the i—th individual using both proﬁles. Using the decision
function as described above, a ﬁnal decision on the class label of the i—th
individual was made.

2.6 Training and testing on independent sets

In case of Feature Set I, classiﬁer was trained on features calculated using
the training set and predictions were made on subjects in test set. In case
of Feature Sets II, III and IV, the classiﬁer was trained on the correct
proﬁle in the training set and predictions were made for individuals in the
test set using both proﬁles. The class label was then decided using the
decision function.

response to inﬁiximab therapy in ulcerative colitis), each contain-
ing two independent datasets.

3.1 Predicting acute rejection in kidney transplantation

In Khatri et al. (2013), the authors identiﬁed 11 genes that are
signiﬁcantly over expressed in acute rejection from four organs.
They report that the identiﬁed genes could diagnose acute rejec-
tion with high speciﬁcity and sensitivity (AUC = 0.8). We ana-
lyzed the dataset generated by the authors (GSE50058) as well as
an independent dataset [GSE21374 by Einecke et al. (2010)], also
analyzed by Khatri et al. (2013) in a similar fashion. The datasets
GSE50058 consists of 43 kidney transplant rejection and 54 non-
rejection samples. Dataset GSE21347 consists of 76 kidney trans-
plant rejection and 206 non-rejection samples.

The raw data was processed as described in Section 2, leading
to a total of 3601 differentially expressed genes in GSE50058 and
454 differentially expressed genes in GSE21374. Among these
differentially expressed genes 334 are shared by both datasets.
Combining both datasets and ﬁltering for genes with unique
entrez id results in 641 differentially expressed genes. These
group-wise differentially expressed genes were used as input to
Bayes-CRE and upstream regulators and corresponding context
(MeSH) terms were identiﬁed. Table 2 summarizes the results.
Note that this analysis was not used in predictions and was per-
formed for biological interpretation as outlined later in this
section.

Figure 3 (left and middle panels) shows the achieved speciﬁcity
and sensitivity for all deﬁned feature sets. Here, we focus on real-
world performance in an independent test set. Details of the
performance differences between cross validation versus inde-
pendent test set are depicted in Figure 4 and will be discussed
in a separate section. The performance of the TOP10 feature is
strikingly different depending on the training set used. Whereas it
is the top performer when training on the GSE21374 data, it
performs worst when roles are switched. This behavior is plaus-
ible when considering the different number of differentially

expressed genes in the two datasets. When training on
GSE21374 chances are that the top 10 genes out of the 454
differentially expressed genes are also contained in the~3600
genes that are differentially expressed in GSE50058. However,
the odds are reversed when training on GSE50058. The ALL
Feature Set does poorly in both datasets. In the larger
GSE50058 dataset one explanation might be there are a
large number of features to pick from which results in
overﬁtting. However, even when training on GSE21374 the
ALL feature performs worst. When comparing accuracy of
prediction based on cross-validation, TOP10 and ALL per-
form almost equally well with an accuracy of 0.78 and 0.79,
respectively (Supplementary Table S1). It appears that the
classiﬁcation algorithm picked features that gave a slight
advantage under training conditions, but which did not gener-
alize at all to the independent test scenario. The Z—score and
GO term features also show variable performance in that
they are highly sensitive in one run, but highly speciﬁc in the
other. The Bayes-CRE features show consistent performance
across GSE21374 and GSE50058. While accuracy is slightly
higher for the TOP10 feature in the ﬁrst case and about
the same for Z—scores in the second case, only the Bayes-CRE
feature is able to retain its performance and, as we will see, is
also stable when going from cross-validation to independent
test set.

To assess the biological plausibility of the upstream regulators
detected by Bayes-CRE, we examined the context of the causal
relationships supporting the generated upstream regulators with
the aid of the MeSH terms enriched with them. Additionally, we
investigated whether the upstream regulators have been previ-
ously identiﬁed as signiﬁcant components of acute rejection biol-
ogy. Table 2 shows the upstream regulators selected by Bayes-
CRE on the group-wise comparisons. The direction of regulation
of differentially expressed genes in combined normalized datasets
was used to generate the table.

Unsurprisingly, several predictive upstream regulator such as
upregulation of IFNG, LPS, IL2, TNF, CXCL12 and IRF7
(Table 2) are consistent with heightened immune response and
hence higher risk of acute rejection. Furthermore, the associated
MeSH terms show abundance of general immunology context
some of which can be speciﬁcally linked to acute rejection such as
MHC Class II, HLA-D antigens and immunodominance. IFNG,
one of the most probable upstream regulators, is known for its
paramount role in acute rejection. In some skin grafts IFNG has
been shown to be necessary for initiating acute graft rejection
(Ring et al., 1999). Additionally, IFNG ELISPOT has been
proposed as a pre—transplant measurement of donor-speciﬁc
memory T-cell and subsequently post-transplant risk
(Augustine et al., 2005). Alefacept is a medication approved by
the FDA for psoriasis and has been suggested as an immuno-
suppressive agent for kidney transplantation (Cooper and
Wiseman, 2010). It is a humanized antibody that is thought to
inhibit memory T-cells. Hence, predicted decrease of Alefacept
may be a surrogate regulator implying activation of memory
T-cells. Once activated, T-cells produce IL2 and other cytokines.
In summary, the signiﬁcant upstream regulators may provide a
plausible biological explanation of main events that are predict-
ive of acute rejection, from antigen presentation to T-cell activa-
tion and cytokine release.

3.2 Response to infliximab in ulcerative colitis

In Arijs et al. (2009), the authors studied two cohorts
(A: GE14580 and B: GE12251) of patients who received treat-
ment of inﬁiximab for refractory ulcerative colitis. They deﬁned
response to therapy based on mucosal healing, endoscopic sub-
score and histological sub-score at 4 weeks for patients who
received a single infusion and 6 weeks for patients who received
a loading regimen. In cohort A 24 patients with active ulcerative
colitis were studied. Biopsies were collected within a week prior
to the ﬁrst treatment and 4 weeks post-treatment and gene ex-
pression was measured. Cohort B was a placebo controlled trial
of inﬁiximab therapy in refractory ulcerative colitis where 22
patients with active ulcerative colitis received a loading dose of
inﬁiximab and gene expression was measured prior and post
treatment. Some key differences between Cohorts A and B in-
clude (i) response assessed at week 4 or 6 after inﬁiximab treat-
ment in Cohort A compared to week 8 after inﬁiximab treatment
in Cohort B, (ii) Cohort A patients are treated with 5mg/kg
inﬁiximab and Cohort B patients are treated with 5mg/kg or
10 mg/kg inﬁiximab and (iii) Cohort A patients either have a
single infusion or a loading regimen (0, 2 and 6 weeks) while

Cohort B patients all received a loading regimen (0, 2 and 6
weeks). The cohorts were independent of one another.

Analysis of differential gene expression resulted in 168 differ-
entially expressed genes in cohort B. Differential gene-expression
analysis on cohort A did not result in any signiﬁcantly expressed
genes after FDR correction. Combining the datasets resulted in
280 differentially expressed genes. As in the rejection datasets,
these group-wise differentially expressed genes were used as input
to Bayes-CRE and upstream regulators and corresponding con-
text (MeSH) terms were identiﬁed for biological interpretation
purpose. Table 3 summarizes the results of the combined dataset.
As before, these results were not used for prediction purposes.

All Feature Sets were generated as described before. Since
differential gene-expression analysis on cohort A did not result
in any signiﬁcantly expressed genes, we only used cohort B
as training set and cohort A as testing set. The right panel in
Figure 3 depicts attained speciﬁcity and sensitivity for this data-
set. The G0 terms, Z—scores and ALL Feature Sets perform
poorly on the test set. Picking the TOP10 genes leads to accept-
able performance with an emphasis on sensitivity. The best per-
formance is obtained using the Bayes-CRE features with an

accuracy of 0.79. As before, the Bayes-CRE predictions empha-
size speciﬁcity over sensitivity. It is worth noting that the strategy
of picking top differentially expressed genes has been employed
in the original paper of this study (Arijs et al., 2009). However,
the top ﬁve genes were picked from the combined cohort. While
that is technically correct, the reported performance of 95% sen-
sitivity and 85% speciﬁcity is somewhat misleading as it cannot
be attained on the individual cohorts. As we will see in Figure 4,
similar values are attained in the training cohort here, but cannot
be sustained in the independent test.

Similar to the acute rejection study, we examined the biolo-
gical plausibility of upstream regulators uncovered by Bayes-
CRE. Table 3 shows the top upstream regulators selected by
Bayes-CRE on the group-wise comparisons. The direction of
regulation of differentially expressed genes in combined normal-
ized datasets was used to generate the table.

Ulcerative colitis is a chronic manifestation of inﬂammation of
the colonic mucosa with TNF playing a central role in the dis-
ease. Several anti-TNF therapeutics such as inﬂiximab,
Aadilumab, Certolizumab, Golimumab are now used in patients
who fail to respond to conventional treatment regimens that in-
clude immunosuppressive drugs. However a subset of these pa-
tients do not respond to anti-TNF therapeutics as well and the
biological mechanisms at play here are poorly understood.
Interestingly, one of the signiﬁcant predicted upstream regulators
that distinguishes the inﬂiximab responders from the non-
responders here is the TNF pathway itself. The higher expression
of the TNF pathway components in non-responders may suggest
the lack of response to be due to an inadequate inﬂiximab
dosing. Also to note that this study has been done in patients
who have not been treated with inﬂiximab prior to this study
thus ruling out the non-response to inﬂiximab being due to gen-
eration of anti-inﬂiximab antibodies. MeSH terms associated
with IFNG regulator such as tryptophan and kynurenine metab-
olism are supported by an observed dysregulation of enzymes
such as IDOl, TDO2 and KYNU in these pathways in ulcerative
colitis (data not shown). Another MeSH term, enriched for the
LPS hypothesis, is the cyclooxygenase term with established links
to the disease. A study by Silverberg et al. (2009) shows a genetic
association for IFNG locus with ulcerative colitis. Perturbations
in the gut microbial ﬂora and colonic mucosal integrity in ul-
cerative colitis can result in the dysregulation of predicted

pathways such as LPS and Interferon. DSS-induced colitis in
LPS sensitive mice treated with LPS exhibit a more severe disease
while LPS has no effect in DSS-induced colitis in LPS hypore-
sponsive mice (Lange et al., 1996). Further evidence for a role for
LPS in ulcerative colitis comes from studies showing patients
with elevated levels of LPS in disease (Rojo et al., 2007). LPS,
present only on Gram-negative bacteria binds to TLR4 and in-
duces pro-inﬂammatory cytokines thus driving inﬂammation in
disease. Furthermore genetic studies show a signiﬁcant associ-
ation for TLR4 with ulcerative colitis and Crohns disease (Shen
et al., 2010). It can be inferred that the non-responders have an
overall increased level of inﬂammation despite no signiﬁcant dif-
ferences in the disease activity scores resulting from the activa-
tion of the LPS-TLR4 pathway triggered by the presence of
gram-negative bacteria.

3.3 Analysis of prediction performance

One of the key points of this work is that optimization of meth-
ods based on one study can lead to misleadingly high estimates of
performance and that the use of appropriate prior knowledge
can help to avoid the situation. Figure 4 summarizes the situation
based on our data and implemented methods. As expected, per-
formance in cross-validation runs is higher than in the independ-
ent test sets. In our examples, the TOP10 feature set has one of
the highest declines and, in contrast, Bayes-CRE features have a
consistently small drop in performance. Performance even
slightly improves in the inﬂiximab dataset. It is also interesting
to note the spread in accuracy in the different datasets. When
training on GSE21374 in the kidney rejection dataset (left
panel in Fig. 4), the classiﬁer can pick from a set of R5450 dif-
ferentially expressed genes. Prediction is attempted in GSE50058
which has about eight times more differentially expressed (and
therefore predictive) genes. As the underlying biology is shared
to some extent, chances are higher to pick useful features. This
situation reverses when training on GSE50058 as can be
observed in the large spread of accuracies in the middle panel
of Figure 4.

Unfortunately, it is also not obvious from our data how much
a given feature will deteriorate in performance in an independent
set. For instance, the TOP10 differentially expressed genes ap-
proach works well for two of the three datasets, but does very
poorly on the third (middle panel of Fig. 4). Some feature sets
oscillate between high speciﬁcity and high sensitivity as evident
for the Z—score feature in Figure 3. As accuracy is just one well-
accepted measure of performance, we also analyzed results based
on F-measure and balanced accuracy (see Supplementary Figs S1
and S2) with broadly similar conclusions. As desired, the Bayes-
CRE approach seems to be able to use prior knowledge to focus
on biologically relevant features that translate well to independ-
ent studies.

To analyze why Bayes-CRE features are able to predict stably
in this scenario, we performed a bootstrapping analysis by ran-
domly selecting 2/3 of samples as training and 1/3 as testing on
each dataset. The process was repeated 100 times and the
number of times that the predictive upstream regulator were se-
lected by L1 regularization was recorded. Figure 5 shows how
often an upstream regulator was picked in dataset GSE21374 on
the x-axis and GSE50058 on the y-axis. In addition, the color

Number of times picked in GSE21374

Fig. 5. Number of times each upstream regulator was picked as a top
predictor by the classiﬁer in dataset GSE21374 (x-axis) and dataset
GSE50058 (y-axis) from the acute kidney rejection datasets. Red color
indicates whether an upstream regulator plays a role in the combined
analysis as referenced in Table 2

indicates whether a upstream regulator plays a role in the com-
bined analysis as referenced in Table 2. Clearly, the most preva-
lent upstream regulators of IFNG, LPS and TNF are relevant in
both datasets. In addition, more dataset speciﬁc features can be
seen towards the x- and y-axes of the plot. As the underlying
biology relating to immune response and inﬂammation seems to
be shared among the datasets, the Bayes-CRE approach is able
to integrate the signals from downstream transcripts into a fea-
ture, i.e. the posterior probability of regulation that serves well as
a predictor. That does not seem to be possible based on the gene-
expression data alone. Finally, we also ran permutation experi-
ments to ensure that results are due to the phenotype labels, i.e.
(non-) rejection of kidney transplants and response to inﬂiximab
treatment, and not random artifacts. Permuted datasets did not
result in any or only very few upstream regulators in all permu-
tations. As a consequence, we did not proceed to any higher level
feature generation.

4 DISCUSSION

Patient populations exhibit high genetic, environmental and
phenotypic heterogeneity. This makes the search for robust pre-
dictors in clinical trials a difﬁcult endeavor. If we rely on classical
(low-dimensional) biomarkers, prediction performance might
not be sufﬁcient. Using high dimensional datasets, e. g. transcrip-
tomics datasets, can easily lead to predictors that have stellar
performance in the training trial, but poor performance in an
independent study (Fig. 4). This seems to be the case even when
all proper considerations of cross-validation or a test/training
split within one clinical trial are observed—at least given current
sample sizes. Many methods have been developed to avoid over-
ﬁtting of the data, but as we demonstrate in this work, even a
well-accepted regularized classiﬁer will not always be able to pick
out the biologically robust features based on expression data
alone. We found that any of the deﬁned feature sets is able to
predict with high accuracy under a certain set of circumstances.

For instance, the Z—score proﬁles perform best when trained on
GSE50058, but very poorly in all other cases (Fig. 4). In contrast,
picking the TOP10 genes does not work at all when training on
GSE50058, but well in the other cases. The Bayes-CRE feature
set retained performance across all scenarios tested and was
among the top predictors in independent test sets.

It should be noted that the performance of this method is
strongly dependent on the prior knowledge encoded in the
underlying knowledgebase. If no relevant upstream regulators
are available in the knowledgebase that can aggregate the down-
stream transcriptional signal, performance will be poor as no
useful features can be generated. At the same time, the number
of generated features can easily be checked. If there are a number
of differentially expressed genes present in a dataset, but regula-
tor nodes receive only weak posterior probabilities, the knowl-
edgebase is likely to contain no relevant biology and other
approaches should be pursued. As demonstrated by our results,
generalization to independent datasets in the presence of high
levels of confounding factors (such as clinical site, exact compos-
ition of trial population, etc.) is very difﬁcult and research should
be invested to not only ﬁnd better mathematical approaches to
exploit the dataset at hand, but incorporate other prior know-
ledge in an optimal way. The knowledgebase that we utilize in
this work may contain noise as well, however, this noise should
be independent of a particular trial population as it tries to de-
scribe general biological facts.

Another potential criticism of the Bayes-CRE method is the
focus on IFNG, LPS and TNF as key regulators in the assessed
datasets. Clearly, these nodes are well-known regulators of
immune system and inﬂammatory processes and would have
been picked as relevant by experts in the ﬁelds. We evaluated
the performance of only using IFNG downstream genes as
deﬁned by our knowledgebase. The results are slightly inferior
to Bayes-CRE features, but roughly comparable (Supplementary
Fig. S3). In contrast to the manual trial and error approach of
deﬁning potential downstream genes based on expert opinion
per dataset, the Bayes-CRE approaches provides a comprehen-
sive assessment of relevance of all encoded knowledge in the
knowledgebase. In our cases, it correctly identiﬁed many relevant
potential regulators of involved processes facilitating acceptance
of the derived classiﬁers. This points to a need for public, read-
ily available repositories of causal biological knowledge to derive
better classiﬁers and interpret biological datasets more quickly.
Protein—protein—interaction databases like IntAct (Orchard
et al., 2014) are in the process of adopting their curation process
to include causal relationships (S. Orchard, personal
communication).

The use of other (non-causal) prior knowledge sources is cer-
tainly promising as well. However, we feel that the causal rela-
tionships used in this study are well-suited to summarize
downstream transcriptional activity into fewer features that are
biologically relevant. This might be harder to achieve based on
protein—protein—interaction data as no directionality exists in the
network and the relationships are not directly related to tran-
scriptional activity. In future work we plan to add large-scale
datasets with more complex notion of causality into our meth-
odology as they become available.

It was surprisingly hard to collect public data for this study as
we required trials of at least 20 human subjects with a deﬁned

Clinical outcome prediction based on Bayesian analysis

 

clinical binary outcome, i.e. (i) responders and non-responders,
(ii) at least some detectable difference in gene expression at base-
line between the two groups and (iii) the availability of a similar
but entirely independent trial for testing purposes. We expect this
situation to change over the coming years as more and more
trials generate relevant molecular data and are made available
for public research. However, the size of the trials will remain
limited as the generation of molecular data is only a small frac-
tion of the cost and overall costs of large clinical trials remain
astronomical. This situation will make approaches using prior
knowledge even more relevant.

In future work, we plan to test the methods on more datasets
as they become available, extend the method to allow for con-
tinuous phenotypes and take placebo response for drug trials
into account. The latter should be possible by integrating placebo
arms of clinical trials into the regularized regression framework.
However, we were not able to ﬁnd suitable publicly available
datasets to test such extensions at this point. This will be import-
ant to distinguish diagnostic signatures that are predictive of
disease progression from signatures that are predictive of drug
response itself.

In summary, we have presented a method for prediction of
clinical phenotypes based on genome-wide expression data that
makes use of a large collection of causal relationships deﬁned
from the literature. Features selected by the Ll-regularized re-
gression method correspond to upstream molecular entities that
can readily be interpreted biologically and subsume sets of tran-
scriptional changes in a useful manner. The method performs
well in the analyzed datasets and, importantly, gives stable per-
formance estimates across cross-validation as well as independ-
ent test set runs. Given that more and more clinical trials
involving heterogeneous populations will become available,
methods such as the one presented here can help to make the
vision of precision medicine a reality.

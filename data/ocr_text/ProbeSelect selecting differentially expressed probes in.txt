ABSTRACT

Summary: Transcriptional profiling still remains one of the most popu-
lar techniques for identifying relevant biomarkers in patient samples.
However, heterogeneity in the population leads to poor statistical evi-
dence for selection of most relevant biomarkers to pursue. In particu-
lar, human transcriptional differences can be subtle, making it difficult
to tease out real differentially expressed biomarkers from the variability
inherent in the population. To address this issue, we propose a simple
statistical technique that identifies differentially expressed probes in
heterogeneous populations as compared with controls.

Availability and implementation: The algorithm has been imple-
mented in Java and available at www.sourceforge.net/projects/
probeselect.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput gene expression, protein or metabolite proﬁling
of patient samples has become a standard tool of biomarker
discovery for disease subtypes and progression. Irrespective of
the particular technology platform, be it Affymetrix Chip,
miRNA proﬁles, mass spec proteomics, metabolomics or so
on, the challenge of focusing analyses on the most informative
markers is similar. For heterogeneous diseases, the ﬁrst challen-
ging step analyzing multidimensional data is identiﬁcation of
markers that distinguish disease and control groups. Because
of heterogeneity of the disease, grouping all disease samples for
comparison against healthy controls may fail in identifying mar-
kers that could be speciﬁc to only a small percentage of disease
samples. Once such candidate markers are identiﬁed, unsuper-
vised clustering methods are applied to uncover the disease sub-
structure in the biomarker space.

Consider a hypothetical case of a marker that is 2-fold differ-
ent (l on the log2 scale) in just 10% of disease samples with zero
variability and with 90% of disease samples the same as control
group. The standard deviation in disease groups for this marker
will be 0.1 and the log2-fold difference between cases and
controls only 1.1. Assuming zero variability in controls, such a
marker would only have a z score of 1, thus not signiﬁcant by
either fold or P—value. Nevertheless, this marker clearly

distinguishes a disease subtype from control and the rest of the
population.

First approach to address this challenge has been proposed in
the seminal paper by Perou et al. (2000) where breast cancer
subtypes were identiﬁed using whole-genome expression proﬁl-
ing. In this article, probes with variability >10% in the cohort
were selected for further unsupervised clustering, and this clus-
tering successfully recapitulated major breast cancer molecular
subtypes. This simple method has been applied in numerous sub-
sequent publications and a variety of diseases and sample types.
Another method frequently used is comparison of disease and
control samples and identiﬁcation of probes signiﬁcantly differ-
ent between disease and control cohorts, e.g. as implemented in
LIMMA BioConductor package (Smyth, 2004). Often decisions
determining signiﬁcance thresholds and their stringency of probe
selection are arbitrary.

In this article, we propose a simple statistical formalism for
selection of the probes that distinguish heterogeneous disease
samples from healthy controls. The standard clustering approach
considers all probes with a high coefﬁcient of variation
(CV>10% typically) and subsequently clusters both controls
and cases to discover a structure that may separate controls
from cases. In comparison, our method considers only the
probes that are signiﬁcantly different from healthy controls in
a subgroup of patients. We apply this method to the whole-blood
proﬁles of Secondary Progressive Multiple Sclerosis (SPMS) pa-
tients and uncover distinct subgroups in the patient population
that, when treated as a uniform group, are indistinguishable
from the control-group proﬁles. That is, a standard LIMMA
approach to identiﬁcation of genes differentially expressed be-
tween SPMS and control groups does not identify any signiﬁcant
differences. In addition, the method used by Perou et al. (2000)
(>10% CV) selects 6013 probes, 328 of which overlap with our
method’s selection. However, a standard principal component
analysis (PCA) or hierarchical clustering in the space of these
probes does not separate out the controls from the cases
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

2 METHODS

Our technique overcomes the limitation of poor group statistics (in the
case of ‘disease’ samples) by treating each sample individually. Suppose
we have ‘N’ cases and ‘r’ controls, each sample having ‘3’ probes. We
want to identify probes that are differentially expressed in cases, or sub-
groups thereof, versus controls. A challenge resulting from the inherent
heterogeneity in the cases is that none of the probes show signiﬁcant fold

changes when comparing the cases and controls as groups. Our method
works by ﬁrst computing a z score for each probe in each sample:

eik _ :u/control
Zik = —
Goonﬁol

where ‘i’ indexes the probe (i = 1 . . . s), ‘k’ indexes the sample (k = 1 . . . N),
‘eik’ is the expression value of the ith probe (typically log transformed
units) in the kth sample, ‘,u’ and ‘a’ are the mean expression and standard
deviation for the ith probe in the control samples, respectively. Individual
probes are selected if they pass a z—score cutoff, Zcutoff. The number of
samples in which a probe passes this selection criterion is denoted as m,.
The Zcutoff can be set to a low value, c. g 1.5, to include large number of
probes to begin with.

Once we have computed m, for each probe, we use a binomial model to
ﬁlter the probes. If ‘q’ is the selection probability for a sample
q = P(|z| Z zcumff), then the probability of selecting m,- samples under
the binomial model is as follows:

17(q9 miaN) =  — q)N_mi

The individual z—scores computed previously that pass the cutoffs are all
treated equally (in q). We can then explicitly compute a P—value asso-
ciated with selecting m,- samples under this model:

N
1901 Z milq,N) = Z NCm,q”"'(1 - q)N‘”“'
n=m,-

Because there are ‘s’ probes, we use a Bonferroni or False Discovery Rate
correction to control for false-positives. The probes that pass a cutoff
(0.05) after correction are the probes of interest. The algorithm essentially
is the same for selection of only upregulated or downregulated probes.
Only the calculation of q and m,- are changed to reﬂect the directionality.
In this case, ‘q’ represents only one tail of the normal distribution, and
only those samples that satisfy the direction as well as the cutoff are
included in mi.

3 RESULTS

We applied this method to select differentially expressed probes
in 190 SPMS samples against 30 age- and gender-matched
healthy controls. A standard differential analysis using the
LIMMA package does not identify any probes as signiﬁcant
(at a fold-change cutoff of 1.5). On the other hand, using our

approach, we select 1752 probes from the same dataset. Using
simple PCA of the entire transcriptome we cannot discover any
substructure in this patient population and there is no clear dis-
tinction from controls (Fig. 1A). However, when we apply PCA
to our selected 1752 probes, two major subgroups can be easily
identiﬁed, and one of these subgroups is clearly distinct from
controls (Fig. 1B).

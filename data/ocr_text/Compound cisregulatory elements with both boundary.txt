ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has been suggested that presumably distinct classes of
genomic regulatory elements may actually share common sets of fea-
tures and mechanisms. However, there has been no genome-wide
assessment of the prevalence of this phenomenon.

Results: To evaluate this possibility, we performed a bioinformatic
screen for the existence of compound regulatory elements in the
human genome. We identified numerous such colocated boundary
and enhancer elements from human CD44r T cells. We report evidence
that such compound regulatory elements possess unique chromatin
features and facilitate cell type-specific functions related to inflamma-
tion and immune response in CD4Jr T cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

Several types of cis—regulatory elements have been identiﬁed and
classiﬁed. They include well-deﬁned elements such as transcrip-
tional promoters (Goldberg, 1979), enhancers (Banerji et al.,
1981), boundary elements (Udvardy et al., 1985) and enhancer-
blocking insulators (Kellum and Schedl, 1991). They also include
the less discernable elements like silencers (Laimins et al., 1986),
promoter-tethering elements (Calhoun et al., 2002) and locus
control regions (Grosveld et al., 1987).

Among all cis—regulatory elements, enhancers exhibit the high-
est ﬁexibility and modularity (Lomvardas et al., 2006; Shen et al.,
2012). Mechanistically, enhancers recruit transcription factors,
which can loop over long genomic distances to reach promoters,
thereby giving enhancers the ability to inﬂuence the expression of
distal genes. This long-range capacity of enhancers can, however,
be inhibited by boundary elements, particularly enhancer-
blocking insulators (Kellum and Schedl, 1991). This boundary
element insulating activity protects genes in domains located on
the active sides of boundaries against activating or repressive
regulatory effects of both ﬂanking and distant domains. In this
way, enhancer-blocking insulators play a critical role in facilitat-
ing the speciﬁcity of interactions between enhancers and genes

located in the same chromosomal domains Oil/est and Fraser,
2005). As such, boundaries and enhancers have hitherto been
considered to be functionally antagonistic, and thus to occupy
distinct and separate loci in the genome. To date no genomic loci
have been reported to simultaneously encode the functional
capacities of both enhancers and boundaries on a genome-wide
scale.

Nevertheless, it has previously been suggested that boundaries
and enhancers might actually use a common set of regulatory
features and strategies, and more generally, that many of the
accepted distinctions between classes of regulatory elements
may be overstated (Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006). Considering
this possibility, together with the coordinated regulatory activ-
ities of boundaries and enhancers, we sought to evaluate whether
there actually exist colocated compound boundary-enhancer loci
in the human genome. We found that numerous compound
boundary-enhancer loci do in fact exist in the human genome,
and have epigenetic and regulatory features that are distinct from
those seen for individual regulatory elements of either class.

2 METHODS

2.1 Boundaries, enhancers and compound elements

Sets of boundary elements (n = 2542) Wang et al., 2012) and enhancers
(n=23 574) (Fernandez and Miranda-Saavedra, 2012) previously pre-
dicted to function in CD4Jr T cells were mapped to the human genome
reference sequence (hg18). Compound regulatory elements (designated
B + E) were deﬁned as boundary regions (~8 kb) that contain or overlap
with enhancer elements (~l kb), and the locations of canonical non-com-
pound boundaries (designated B—E) and solitary enhancers (designated
E—B) were retained for comparison. A binomial test of enrichment was
performed to check for statistical overrepresentation of enhancers within
boundary elements compared with their background genomic frequency.

2.2 Chromatin analysis

Four genome-wide functional genomic datasets for CD4+ T cells were
analyzed to characterize the chromatin environment in-and-around the
regulatory elements studied here. These include ChIP-seq generated gen-
omic distributions for eight different histone modiﬁcations (Barski et al.,
2007), genomic sites for 95 710 DNase I hypersensitive (DHS) sites (Boyle
et al., 2008), ChIP-seq generated genomic locations of ~2 million Pol II
binding sites (Barski et al., 2007) and ~8.3 million RNA-seq tags (Barski
et al., 2010). For each of these datasets, fold-enrichment plots in-and-
around regulatory elements were computed and normalized using gen-
omic background averages. For histone marks, the combined histone

fold-enrichment index was computed as the sum of fold enrichments for
individual marks (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Methods).
Differences in fold enrichment for compound and non-compound regula-
tory elements were evaluated using paired Mann—Whitney U-tests.

2.3 Gene expression analysis

Gene expression in 79 human tissues was computed for RefSeq gene
annotations as previously described (inngo et al., 2011) using the
Novartis Expression Atlas (Su et al., 2004). Gene expression levels were
compared between B + E, B—E and E—B elements using Mann—Whitney
U-tests.

2.4 Gene set enrichment analysis

For gene set enrichment analysis, we evaluated the distribution of func-
tionally coherent sets of genes, as deﬁned by shared Gene Ontology (GO)
categories or presence in the same Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathways, around compound (B+E) versus non-
compound (B—E and E—B) boundary elements. The hypergeometric
test was used to evaluate the signiﬁcance of the enrichment of genes
within a deﬁned functional group around sets of regulatory elements.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Compound regulatory element discovery approach

We evaluated the existence of compound cis—regulatory elements
(designated as B+E) in the human genome by searching for
genomic loci that are predicted to function simultaneously as
both boundary elements and enhancers (Fig. 1A). Analyses of
the genomic distributions of histone modiﬁcations have led to
the discovery of characteristic patterns at several genomic regu-
latory features like boundary elements (W ang et al., 2012) and
enhancers (Birney et al., 2007; Visel et al., 2009). These regula-
tory element-speciﬁc histone modiﬁcation proﬁles have been
used to develop algorithms that can accurately predict regulatory
elements from genome-wide ChIP-seq datasets. For example,
ChIP—seq data for histone modiﬁcations and RNA Pol II—bind-
ing have been used to perform a genome-wide prediction of
human chromatin boundaries (\Nang et al., 2012). Likewise,
enhancers have been predicted in several human cell lines
(Heintzman et al., 2009). We analyzed the locations of bound-
aries and enhancers predicted in this way for human CD4+ T
cells. There are 2542 predicted boundary elements (W ang et al.,
2012) and 23 574 predicted enhancers (Fernandez and Miranda-
Saavedra, 2012).

3.2 Enrichment of compound boundary-enhancer elements
in the human genome

We intersected the human genome coordinates of predicted
boundary elements with those of predicted enhancers and found
690 genomic locations with colocated boundary and enhancer
annotations (Fig. 1B). These compound regulatory elements rep-
resent ~27% of all boundary elements in our dataset. The bound-
ary element predictions used here cover broader genomic regions
(8 kb) than the enhancer predictions (1 kb); thus, compound
boundary elements may be colocated with multiple enhancers.
We compared the observed occurrence of B + E elements against
their expected level of occurrence, based on the background gen-
omic frequencies of the individual element classes, to ensure that

their presence could not be attributed to chance alone. A binomial
test of enrichment revealed predicted enhancers to be signiﬁcantly
enriched within predicted boundary elements relative to their gen-
omic background frequency (Z: 5.65, P: 1.6 e-08); there are
66-fold more predicted enhancers occurring in boundaries than
can be expected by chance alone. B + E elements are much more
enriched around clusters of enhancers than around enhancers
outside boundaries (Supplementary Fig. 1E).

This overrepresentation of enhancers within predicted bound-
ary regions is surprising, as boundaries have only been known to
have a presumably antagonistic enhancer-blocking activity
(Kellum and Schedl, 1991). Conversely, this ﬁnding supports
the proposition that classes of regulatory elements typically con-
sidered to be distinct actually share sets of features and mechan-
isms (Gaszner and Felsenfeld, 2006). In any case, the enrichment
of enhancers within predicted boundary element regions suggests
an important functional role for these compound regulatory
elements.

Compound cis-regulatory elements

 

3.3 Compound boundary-enhancer elements possess
unique regulatory features

The enrichment of enhancers within boundary element regions
suggests that compound B+E regulatory elements represent a
functionally distinct combination of their individual constituent
elements. In that case, we expect to observe distinct regulatory
features, e.g. chromatin and expression proﬁles, for compound
B+E elements when compared with B—E and E—B elements.
To test this prediction, we compared chromatin and expression
proﬁles from CD4+ T cells for B +E elements versus B—E and
E—B elements. This was done using ChIP-seq data for eight
histone modiﬁcations (W ang et al., 2008) to evaluate the chro-
matin modiﬁcation state, DHS site data to evaluate the openness
of local chromatin and PolII and RNA-seq data to evaluate
transcriptional states.

For each of these datasets, enrichment plots showing fold
enrichment compared with genomic background levels were
computed for 20 kb regions centered on B+E elements versus
B—E and E—B elements (Fig. 1C and D and Supplementary
Fig. S1). In addition, the overall average fold enrichment levels
across these regions were determined (bar graphs in Fig. 1 and
Supplementary Fig. S1). When considered jointly, the eight his-
tone modiﬁcations show signiﬁcantly higher enrichment for
compound B + E regions than seen for B—E and E—B regions.
These particular histone modiﬁcations (see Supplementary Fig.
SlA and B) were chosen owing to their previously characterized
associations with boundary elements and/or enhancers
(Fernandez and Miranda-Saavedra, 2012; Heintzman et al.,
2007; Heintzman et al., 2009). With respect to the individual
histone modiﬁcations, 7 of 8 histone modiﬁcations, all of which
are active modiﬁcations, show increased enrichment around the
compound B + E elements (Supplementary Fig. SlB). The
sole exception to this pattern is seen for the repressive modiﬁ-
cation H3K27me3. Furthermore, it can be seen that the
overall levels of histone modiﬁcations are higher for the
active side of the boundaries (boundary start position till
+10 kb) than for the repressive side (—10kb till boundary
start position), and this effect is also more pronounced
for compound B+E elements than B—E and E—B elements
(Fig. 1C, bar graph).

When averaged across the open side of elements, similar pat-
terns of greater B + E enrichment compared with B—E and E—B
regions can be seen for Pol II binding data, DHS sites and RNA-
seq data (bar graphs in Fig. 1D and Supplementary Fig. 1C and
D). The RNA-seq data show a qualitatively distinct pattern com-
pared with the other datasets with an extremely marked peak
close to the start and center positions. This pattern could indicate
that B + E elements most actively protect gene expression in their
most proximal regions and could also point to a speciﬁc role for
expression of non-coding RNAs in establishing boundary elem-
ent and enhancer activity. Support for both of these possibilities
has previously been reported (Lunyak et al., 2007; Wang et al.,
2012).

It is, therefore, apparent that compound B +E elements pos-
sibly modulate chromatin structure and facilitate transcriptional
changes in a more profound manner than do B—E and E—B
elements.

3.4 Compound boundary-enhancer elements enhance cell
type-speciﬁc gene expression

The distinct chromatin changes and higher transcriptional activ-
ity across B + E elements suggest that these regulatory elements
may help to facilitate higher expression levels of proximal genes
(within 10 kb) than B—E elements. Because enhancers boost gene
expression levels, we expect their inclusion into boundary elem-
ent regions to result in higher expression of nearby genes. To test
this prediction, we compared the relative expression levels of
genes on the active sides of B+E versus B—E and E—B elem-
ents. As expected, B + E elements yield average expression levels
qualitatively similar to those of E—B and greater than B—E
elements.

Furthermore, this effect can be seen to be cell type-speciﬁc
(Fig. 1E), as the expression is much more pronounced in the
CD4+ T cells where the regulatory elements were predicted com-
pared with a panel of 78 additional cell types and tissues (Fig. 1E).
Additionally, B + E associated genes are signiﬁcantly enriched for
CD4+ T cell-speciﬁc expression compared with genes not asso-
ciated with B + E elements (Supplementary Table S1).

3.5 Potential functional signiﬁcance for compound
boundary-enhancer elements

Gene set enrichment, based on GO and KEGG pathway anno-
tations, was used to evaluate the potential functional signiﬁcance
of B + E elements for CD4+ T cells. To do this, the set of genes
that lie within 10 kb of B +E elements were evaluated for evi-
dence of coherent functional signatures that could be related to T
cell-speciﬁc or immune-related function. This analysis revealed
genes that are signiﬁcantly enriched around B + E elements and
encode proteins with functions that are directly relevant to CD4+
T cell activity; these are genes involved in the chemokine signal-
ing pathway (GO:007098).

Chemotaxis, growth, differentiation and apoptosis of inﬂam-
matory cells, like T-lymphocytes and eosinophils, are achieved
via the chemokine signaling pathway, which is largely dependent
on the activation of PIK3 kinases (Britten 2013; Curnock et al.,
2002; Klarenbeek et al., 2013). Chemokine signaling pathway
genes are enriched around compound B + E elements
(hypergeometric test; P: 9.0 e—13), compared with B—E bound-
aries (P = 0.0055) and E—B (P = 5.4 e-09). Additionally, pathway
genes proximal to B + E elements are expressed at levels com-
parable with those of solitary enhancers and higher than B—E
elements. (Fig. 2A and B and Supplementary Fig. S2). This is
speciﬁcally exempliﬁed by the PIK3 gene, which is functionally
central to the chemokine signaling pathway (Fig. 2D). PIK3 is
expressed at higher levels in CD4+ T cells (SI: 3463) relative to
other human tissues (average SI: 755), and there are two B + E
compound elements that can be seen to ﬂank the gene thus
helping to maintain its relatively open chromatin environment
(Fig. 2C).

4 CONCLUSIONS

This study supports the existence of compound regulatory elem-
ents that encode both boundary and enhancer activities with
relevance to T cell-speciﬁc functions. These ﬁndings are consist-
ent with previous postulations of overlap between regulatory

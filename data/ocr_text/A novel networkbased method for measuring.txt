ABSTRACT

Motivation: In the functional genomic era, a large number of
gene sets have been identified via high-throughput genomic and
proteomic technologies. These gene sets of interest are often
related to the same or similar disorders or phenotypes, and are
commonly presented as differentially expressed gene lists, co-
expressed gene modules, protein complexes or signaling pathways.
However, biologists are still faced by the challenge of comparing
gene sets and interpreting the functional relationships between gene
sets into an understanding of the underlying biological mechanisms.
Results: We introduce a novel network-based method, designated
corrected cumulative rank score (CCRS), which analyzes the
functional communication and physical interaction between genes,
and presents an easy-to-use web-based toolkit called GsNetCom
to quantify the functional relationship between two gene sets. To
evaluate the performance of our method in assessing the functional
similarity between two gene sets, we analyzed the functional
coherence of complexes in functional catalog and identified protein
complexes in the same functional catalog. The results suggested that
CCRS can offer a significant advance in addressing the functional
relationship between different gene sets compared with several
other available tools or algorithms with similar functionality. We also
conducted the case study based on our method, and succeeded
in prioritizing candidate leukemia-associated protein complexes
and expanding the prioritization and analysis of cancer-related
complexes to other cancer types. In addition, GsNetCom provides a
new insight into the communication between gene modules, such as
exploring gene sets from the perspective of well-annotated protein
complexes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Numerous systematic biological studies have revealed that cellular
function in a biological system normally involves the participation
and interaction of multiple genes (Subramanian et al., 2005; Zhang
et al., 2006). In the functional genomic era, a large number of
gene sets have been identiﬁed through the application of high—
throughput genomic, proteomic technologies, such as microarray,
mass spectrometry and CHIP—on—chip assays and next—generation
sequencing technologies (Huang da et al., 2009b; Morozova and
Marra, 2008). Gene sets of interest may be related to disorders or
disease phenotypes and the biological interpretation of gene set data
may therefore be of great importance.

During the past several years, an increasing number of
computational tools has been developed and played an important
role in helping biologists explore these gene sets of interest. Of the
tools contributing to the functional analysis of gene sets, most are
enrichment tools and as reviewed by Huang da et al. (2009a). A
signiﬁcant portion of these bioinformatic enrichment tools is based
on Gene Ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000), and only allow
users to submit a single gene set and identify over—represented
GO terms in ‘interesting’ gene set compared with the background
through statistical analysis. Examples of such tools include GOstat
(Beissbarth and Speed, 2004), GO::TermFinder (Boyle et al., 2004)
and GOEAST (Zheng and Wang, 2008). Recently, some new tools
and improved versions of previous tools, which integrate diverse and
heterogeneous data content (e. g. KEGG pathways, gene expression
data) have been released for the comprehensive functional analysis
of single gene set, examples of which include Gazer (Kim et al.,
2007), GeneTrail (Backes et al., 2007), DAVID (Huang da et al.,
2009) and GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005).

Within a biological system, no gene set functions in an isolated
manner, even in fairly complete pathways. One gene set is
interconnected with other gene sets through complex mechanisms,
and these relationships may affect related disorders and phenotypes.
Therefore, a common challenge faced by experimental biologists is
to gain a better understanding of the functional relationships between
different gene sets. A few computational tools have been developed
to compare gene sets, most of which are based on GO, such as
FatiGO (Al—Shahrour et al., 2007) and ProfCom (Antonov et al.,
2008). Some GO—based semantic similarity methods can also be
used to compare two gene sets by averaging the pairwise distances
between the elements (Resnik, 1999; Sevilla et al., 2005; Wang
et al., 2007). Currently, most of the GO terms have been assigned a

highly skewed distribution (Kim 61611., 2007; Pesquita 61611., 2009).
In essence, GO is a language—based annotation, and it is difﬁcult
to ﬁnely tune GO annotation terms for genes to reﬂect the actual
complexity of biological functions and relationships (Kim 61 611.,
2007; Pesquita 61 611., 2009). Another approach is to use literature
keywords to compare gene sets, as described by Martini (Soldatos
61 611., 2010). However, these types of computational tools have
been implemented based on the same idea of mapping biological
knowledge on sets of genes using GO or literatures and only found
GO terms or keywords that are signiﬁcantly over—represented in one
set of genes versus a second reference set to compare two gene sets,
and did not provide functional similarity score between two gene
sets provided by users.

Proteins generally do not function in isolation, but rather function
as part of a molecular machine. Biological and cellular functions
are performed in a modular and hierarchical fashion (Barabasi
and Oltvai, 2004; Pinkert 61 611., 2010; Qi 61 611., 2008). Previous
studies have shown that protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks
can reﬂect functional communication among proteins (Jiang and
Keating, 2005; Lin 61 611., 2004; Lu 61 611., 2005) and the closer the
two proteins are in a network, the more similar their functions are
likely to be (Sharan 61 611., 2007). From many perspectives, this
information is more suitable as it is expected that the functional
relationship between gene sets can be well exhibited (Antonov 61611.,
2008; Lubovac, 2009). In this study, we present a novel network—
based method, the corrected cumulative rank score (CCRS), for
understanding how gene sets communicate at the higher protein
interaction network level. Based on the protein complexes database
CORUM (the Comprehensive Resource of Mammalian protein
complexes, http://mips.helmholtz—muenchen.de/genre/proj/corum),
we evaluated the performance of the CCRS method. We presented
two case studies to demonstrate that the CCRS method can offer
a signiﬁcant advance in addressing the functional relationships
between different gene sets. GsNetCom is freely accessible at
http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/GsNetCom.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Data sources

PPI data were obtained from the HPRD (Keshava Prasad et 611., 2009),
BioGRID (Stark etal., 2006), IntAct (Kerrien etal., 2007), MINT database
(Ceol et 611., 2010), DIP (Salwinski et 611., 2004) and by the co—citation
of text mining (Ramani et 611., 2005). We derived a non—redundant human
PPI network comprising 69 331 interactions between 11305 proteins. The
topological characteristics of PPI network were summarized in Table 1.
To assess the performance of our method, protein complex data was used.
Experimentally veriﬁed protein complexes from human were downloaded
from the CORUM database (Ruepp et 611., 2010) at the Munich Information
Center for Protein Sequences (MIPS) (Mewes et 611., 2008). The CORUM
database provides a resource of manually annotated protein complexes from
mammalian organisms (Ruepp 61611., 2010). The CORUM dataset is available
in two alternative versions, the core dataset and the complete dataset, for
searching and downloading (Ruepp et 611., 2010). The core dataset is a reduced
dataset which is essentially free of redundant entries, whereas the complete
dataset consists of all annotated protein complexes. The function of protein
complexes in the CORUM database is annotated using the MIPS Functional
Catalog (FunCat) (Ruepp 61611., 2004, 2010). There are 1343 human protein
complexes in the core dataset and 1828 human protein complexes in the
complete dataset. All nine cancer gene expression proﬁles were downloaded
from NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus. To exclude potential platform—related

Plus 2.0 arrays for cancer gene expression proﬁles. A detailed description of
all datasets can be found in Supplementary Table $1.

2.2 Statistical analysis

To obtain the statistical signiﬁcance of CCRS, we performed gene set
sampling analysis and made the empirical distribution (with simulation) of
the CCRS. A large number of simulated gene set pairs of the same size as
given gene sets pair was randomly sampled from all human genes and the
CCRS values were recomputed for each random gene set pair. ScoreP denoted
the functional similarity score between a given gene set pair, N was the
number of the simulated gene set pairs and M denoted the number of sampled
gene set pairs having an equal or larger CCRS value than ScoreP. The estimate
of the empirical P—value was obtained as P=M/N. The empirical P—value
based on such randomizations represented the probability of obtaining a
score greater than a given score by chance.

2.3 Input format of GsNetCom

In this study, we present an easy—to—use web—based toolkit called GsNetCom
for assessing the functional similarity of two gene sets. This software enables
a new insight into the communication between gene modules and allows for
the exploration of gene sets from the perspective of well—annotated protein
complexes based on the CCRS method and PPIs. GsNetCom requires text—
fonnatted input of two lists of genes of interest. For the functional annotation
of gene sets, one list of genes can be used as an input. GsNetCom supports
many gene or gene product identiﬁers such as Gene Symbol (Sayers et 611.,
2009), Entrez Gene ID (Sayers et 611., 2009), RefSeq Protein ID (Sayers et 611.,
2009), SwissProt/Uniprot and UniGene (Sayers et 611., 2009).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Functional similarity measures (CCRS)

A schematic representation of the CCRS method is provided in
Figure 1. This method measures the functional similarity between
two gene sets considering the functional communication and
physical interaction between these genes. We deﬁned the ‘function
distance’ between two genes as the shortest path length from one
gene to another through the existing paths of the PPI network (the
shorter the distance, the more similar the function between the two
genes). So we are able to rank the functional similarity between two
genes using the reciprocal of the ‘function distance’. For comparing
two gene sets, we cumulated the rank scores for every gene pair
between the two sets. As we know, a gene set must be entirely
functional consistent with itself. Thus when compared two identical
gene sets, two assumptions were made. First, we assumed that there

is a direct interaction between a gene and itself. Second, if there is
a path between two genes which belonged to the same gene set, we
presumed that the ‘function distance’ is one regardless of the length
of the path. Based on these assumptions, we were able to correct the
value of the cumulative rank score between two gene sets when the
gene sets overlapped.

In this section, we demonstrated how to compute the CCRS of
two gene sets, GI and Gz. The intersection of GI and 02 is denoted
by G. There are n paths among the m nodes of the intersection G,
based on the PPI network, for two genes 19 and 61 that are taken from
GI and Gz, respectively.

Where rpq represents the ‘function distance’ (the length of the
shortest path) between gene 19 and gene 61, and qu is the rank score
between them, Rm: 1/rpq or quzexp(—rpq). N is the number
of the existing ‘function distance’ values [including the ‘function
distance’ of the overlapping nodes (m) from the node to itself]. When
there is no path from gene 19 to gene 61, we can deﬁne rpqzoo
and in this case, the rank score (Rm) is zero. In our study, we
set 012,8: y=6 = land chose qu =1/rpq. In the deﬁnition of the
CCRS method, we learn that Eng EGOt'quz Eng EGG/rm):
m—l—n. Our algorithms not only used network topology information
but also considered biological information. Here, we chose the
reciprocal of harmonic mean as the score rather than the reciprocal of

arithmetic mean to minimize the cost of edges between two proteins
at greater distances (Krauthammer 61 611., 2004; Ma 61611., 2007).

3.2 Analysis of the performance of the CCRS method

To evaluate the performance of our CCRS method in assessing
the functional similarity between two gene sets, we conducted
experiments on the functional similarity of human protein
complexes. The protein complex data were derived from the
CORUM database (Ruepp 61611., 2008). The CORUM database is a
biological annotation resource for protein complexes based on the
Functional Catalo annotation scheme, which contains 1343 human
protein complexes in the core dataset and 1828 human protein
complexes in the complete dataset (one protein complex will be
regarded as one gene set). The CCRS functional similarity measure
was analyzed in terms of the functional coherence of complexes
in Functional Catalog and the identiﬁcation of protein complexes
which are in the same Functional Catalog.

First, we used the CCRS method to exploit the hierarchy of
function for each complex and determine whether this method can
offer a signiﬁcant advance in evaluating the functional relationship
between two gene sets. In our analysis, we used all 1343 core
protein complexes in human available in the CORUM database
and assembled them into 901153 (C12343) pairs of complexes.
Speciﬁcally, we expect our functional similarity measure to exhibit
relatively high CCRS values for the protein complex pairs that
are annotated in the same functional categories, and low values
for the pairs in different categories. Based on FunCat (MIPS
Functional Catalogue), we organized the complex pairs into two

groups: (i) intercategory pairs, when the two complexes in a complex
pair were not annotated as belonging to a common catalog; (ii)
intracategory pairs, when the two complexes in a complex pair
were annotated as belonging to a common catalog. The number
of complex pairs in these two groups was 431494 and 469 659,
respectively. The average of CCRS values for these two groups are
shown in Figure 2A. Based on the CCRS method, the average CCRS
value of the intercategory complex pairs was below that of the intra—
category complex pairs. Furthermore, because every main functional
category is organized as a hierarchical, tree—like structure, we sorted
the 469 659 intra—category pairs according to the category level. For
example, based on the FunCat Catalog, the annotations of complex
75 are FunCat 12.07 and 14.07.03 and the annotation of complex 81
is FunCat 14.07.05. The common functional category of complex 75
and complex 81 is FunCat 14.07. We classiﬁed this complex pair as
category subgroup level2. According to the criteria described above,
we obtained ﬁve category subgroups: levell, level2, level3, level4
and leve15. Pairs classiﬁed into the most speciﬁc levels (level6 and
above) were rare, so were grouped into category leve15. Figure 2B
shows the average CCRS values of the ﬁve subgroups. The more
speciﬁc the Functional Catalog of the complex pairs, the higher the
CCRS values.

Next, we performed above analysis by deﬁning a score function as
the reciprocal of arithmetic mean (RAM), and made a comparison
with our CCRS. Based on RAM, the average similarity score of
the intra—category pairs was higher than that of the intercategory
pairs (Fig. 2A). The same was found to be true for the average
similarity values of the ﬁve subgroups (Fig. 2B). To further assess
the performance of the CCRS and RAM, we normalized the variance
of the average scores of the subgroups (ASS). The average variance
rate (AVR) was deﬁned as follows:

AVR:iASS(Li+1)—ASS(L,-)
i=1 4ASS(L,-)

 

where L,- is the level—i category. The AVR of the CCRS method
was 10.92% and the AVR of the RAM was 9.47% (Fig. 2C),
indicating that the CCRS method is more effective at distinguishing
the functional hierarchy of complexes than RAM.

To further evaluate the performance of the CCRS method
in measuring the functional relationship between two gene
sets, we used a cross—validation method to examine how
effectively the CCRS method can predict function—associated
complexes. We randomly selected a ﬁne Functional Catalog (FunCat
1102.03.01.01) as the positive complex set. There are 13 human

complexes in FunCat 1102.03.01.01. Every complex in the positive
set was selected as the target complex in turn. Then, we randomly
extracted 87 protein complexes from the database to comprise the
negative complex set. There were no common partners between the
positive and negative complex sets. The complexes selected were
all core complexes. Based on the results of analysis with the CCRS
method, we determined the function—associated complexes (positive
complexes) identiﬁed by the target complex. Receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves were used to evaluate the sensitivity
and speciﬁcity of identiﬁcation of the function—associated complexes
with the target complex. Sensitivity measures the proportion of
actual positives complexes which are correctly identiﬁed, and
speciﬁcity measures the proportion of negative complexes which
are correctly identiﬁed.

Figure 3 shows the results of cross—validation via the ROC curves
obtained by calculating the sensitivity [sensitivity=TP/(TP+FN)]
and 1—speciﬁcity [speciﬁcity=FP/(TN+FP)] at different cutoffs,
with ROC area under the curve (AUC) values between 0.886 and
0.940, except for complexes 92 and 921. The AUC values for all
13 cases are shown in Table 2. In the PPI network, we found that
members of complexes 92 and 921 scarcely interacted with members
of other complexes in FunCat 1102.03.01.01 (Fig. 4). This ﬁnding
may have been due to the sparsity of PPI data.

3.3 Comparisons with similar tools or algorithms

Finally, we also performed a comparison between the CCRS method
and several other tools or algorithms of similar functionality, some

of which were based on GO, to examine GO annotations such as
FatiGO and ProfCom. Another existed approach, such as Martini,
is based on the use of literature keywords to compare gene sets.
However, these existed tools found GO terms or literature keywords
that are signiﬁcantly over—represented in one set of genes versus
a second reference set to reveal the difference between two gene
sets rather than provide functional similarity measure between two
gene sets provided by users. In comparison to these tools, the
CCRS provides a quantitative analysis for exploring the functional
relationship between two gene sets in the context of PPI networks
and performs statistical tests on the analysis results. We also provide
a comparison of the CCRS method with the GO—based pairwise
similarity measure method which was used to compare two gene
sets by averaging the pairwise distances between the elements using
Resnik’s algorithm which is the most commonly used measure for
the functional prediction/validation of GO—based semantic similarity
measures (Pesquita 61 611., 2009; Resnik, 1999; Sevilla 61 611., 2005;
Wang 61611., 2007). Using pairwise semantic similarity of GO terms,
we computed the functional similarity score of 901 153 pairs of
complexes. Then, we assembled the complex pairs into different
groups according to the FunCat Catalog. The same classiﬁcation was
used. Based on pairwise semantic similarity measures, the average
similarity score of the intra—category pairs was higher than that of
the intercategory pairs (Fig. 5A). The same was found to be true
for the average similarity values of the ﬁve subgroups (Fig. 5B).

Again, we exploited the AVR to further assess the performance of
the CCRS and GO—based pairwise semantic similarity measures.
The AVR of the CCRS method was 10.92% and the average
AVR of the GO—based semantic similarity measures was 8.86%
(Fig. 5C), indicating that the CCRS method is more effective
at distinguishing the functional hierarchy of complexes than the
GO—based semantic similarity measures. In summary, these results
conﬁrm that the CCRS method offers a signiﬁcant advance in
addressing the functional relationships between different gene sets.

3.4 Extended function: functional analysis of gene sets
based on protein complex data

Bioinformatic enrichment tools based on diverse and heterogeneous
data content (e. g. GO, KEGG pathways and gene expression data)
have been widely used in the functional analysis of single gene
set. Here, we show that functional annotation of gene sets based
on protein complex data can be performed effectively using the
GsNetCom software. When user inputs a query gene set, GsNetCom
uses the CCRS method to analyze the functional associations
between the query gene set and known complexes, and provide the
user with a ranked complex list showing the potential function of
the query gene set.

3.5 Case study

As an example, to illustrate the application of comparing gene
sets using GsNetCom, we selected a known disease gene set
(leukemia—related genes) as the input dataset and identiﬁed disease—
related protein complexes using the CCRS method. The 141
leukemia—related genes were extracted from the Genetic Association
Database (GAD) (Becker 61611., 2004), an archive of human genetic
association studies of complex diseases and disorders. We computed
the functional similarity scores between the leukemia—related gene
set and every protein complex using the CCRS method. The 10
protein complexes with the highest functional similarity scores with
the leukemia gene set were listed and shown in Table 3. Among these
10 leukemia—related complexes, we found that complexes 2892 and
2895 had already been annotated as leukemia—related complexes
in the CORUM database. Furthermore, complexes 2681 and 2679
had been reported as leukemia—related complexes in the literatures
(Borellini and Glazer, 1993; Puil et 611., 1994). The remaining six
complexes are new candidate leukemia—related complexes.

Based on the above observations, we expanded the case of
leukemia to other cancer types using the CCRS method for
prioritizing cancer—related complexes. We applied the CCRS method
to the differentially expressed gene sets for ovarian cancer,
renal carcinoma, hepatocellular carcinoma, squamous cell lung
carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, papillary thyroid cancer, breast
carcinoma, urinary bladder cancer and colorectal adenoma, and
found several common cancer—related complexes. The results seem
to imply that there exist common mechanisms in the cancer biology.

We applied the signiﬁcance analysis of microarray (SAM) method
to identify differentially expressed genes between cancer samples
and corresponding controls (Supplementary Table S2) (Tusher
61 611., 2001). All genes with a 61—value <0.001 were considered
as differentially expressed genes. Then we made the differentially
expressed gene set as input gene set in turn and identiﬁed the
cancer—related complexes using the CCRS method. We computed
the functional similarity scores between the differentially expressed

The protein complex has been annotated in CORUM database as leukemia-related complex and designated as ‘YES’. The protein complex has been reported as leukemia-related

cancer gene set and every complex in CORUM and ranked the
complexes in descending order of the scores. The top 20 protein
complexes with every cancer gene set were listed and shown in
Supplementary Table S3.

Out of these cancer—related complexes, six (16%) are shared
among these nine cancer types: BCR—ABL (p185 fusion protein)—
GRB2 complex (2892), EGFR—CBL—GRB2 complex (2542), SHC—
GRB2 complex (2895), p53 homotetramer complex (2861), p53—
SPl complex (2679) and TRAF6 oligomer complex (2704).
Based on FunCat, these complexes were involved in the cellular
communication/signal transduction mechanism, transcription or
regulation of metabolism and protein function. There are 19
(51%) cancer—related complexes which are at least involved in the
biological process of ﬁve different cancer types.

Gene TP53 is a tumor suppressor gene, which is mutated in >50%
of the human tumor. These mutations encode distinct isoforms of
protein p53, which can regulate p53 transcriptional activity. This
is consistent with our study that p53 homotetramer complex is
the cancer—related complex with all the cancer types. Based on
the pathways in cancer of KEGG we found that BCR—ABL (p185
fusion protein)—GRB2 complex (2892), EGFR—CBL—GRB2 complex
(2542) and SHC—GRB2 complex (2895) are the components of the

ErbB signaling pathway, and these complexes indirectly affect the
sustained angiogenesis, evading apoptosis and proliferation which
are important features of cancer biological process. TRAF6 (TRAF6
oligomer complex) is a member of TRAF family, which has been
implicated in the activation of these transcription factors by the
tumor necrosis factor superfamily. The six cancer—related complexes
mentioned above, are associated with all of nine cancer types. In our
study, we also found two speciﬁc prostate cancer—related complexes:
complex 5460 and complex 5464, which are involved in the prostate
cancer pathway of KEGG In conclusion, we found that most cancer—
related complexes obtained by the CCRS method are shared by
different cancer types. Our study revealed common network patterns
in different cancer types.

stored in MySQL 5 DBMS and the server—side is implemented in java
1.6 scripts. The GsNetCom system uses J GraphT 0.8.2 to implement
its core analysis algorithm. This software is freely available to all
users at http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/GsNetCom.

The computational complexity of GsNetCom is 0(mn), where m,
n is the size of query gene set 1 and gene set 2, respectively. We used
Dijkstra’s algorithm to ﬁnd the shortest path between two different
proteins in the integrated PPI network based on adjacent matrix.
As we know, Dijkstra’s algorithm runs in 0(V2) for networks with
V vertices. To make the efﬁciency of GsNetCom acceptable, we
preprocessed integrated PPI network with Dijkstra’s algorithm, and
prestored all shortest paths between every two different proteins. So
the computational complexity of GsNetCom is independent of the
size of involved PPI network, and only in proportion to the size of
query gene list.

4 DISCUSSION

Via the application of various technologies, biologists often identify
gene sets of interest which may be involved with related disorders
or phenotypes. However, comparing two gene sets and determining
the functional relationships between them remains a challenging
and daunting task. Several computational tools have been developed
to compare gene sets. However, these tools generally found GO
terms or keywords that are signiﬁcantly over—represented in one
set of genes versus a second reference set to compare two gene
sets.

To remedy these problems, we developed a novel network—
based method, designated CCRS, which takes into account the
functional communication and physical interaction of genes, and
presented an easy—to—use web—based toolkit called GsNetCom
(http://bioinfo.hrbmu.edu.cn/GsNetCom/). The GsNetCom software
quantiﬁes the functional relationships between gene sets and
performs statistical tests on the analysis results. Based on the
protein complex database CORUM, we evaluated the performance
of the CCRS method. In comparison to other available tools or
algorithms, CCRS provides a signiﬁcant advance in exploring the
functional relationship between gene sets in the context of PPI
network and performs statistical tests on the analysis results. Also,
in the case study of cancer—associated protein complexes, CCRS
successfully prioritized cancer—associated complexes. In addition,
GsNetCom provides a new insight into the communication from
gene modules, such as exploring gene sets from the perspective
of well—annotated protein complexes. In its current version, the
CCRS method computes the shortest path of any two genes
between two gene sets as the ‘function distance’. However,
‘function distance’ could more effectively be modeled using edge
capacitance or optimization of edge constraints. In the near further
we plan to improve GsNetCom by incorporating edge capacitance
or optimization of edge constraints and some other biological
information to comprehensively address the functional relationships
between two gene sets. Furthermore, the annotation of gene sets
could be improved by the supplementation of protein complex
data.

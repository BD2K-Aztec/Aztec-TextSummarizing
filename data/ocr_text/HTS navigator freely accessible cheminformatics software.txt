ABSTRACT

Summary: We report on the development of the high-throughput
screening (HTS) Navigator software to analyze and visualize the results
of HTS of chemical libraries. The HTS Navigator processes output files
from different plate readers’ formats, computes the overall HTS matrix,
automatically detects hits and has different types of baseline naviga-
tion and correction features. The software incorporates advanced che-
minformatics capabilities such as chemical structure storage and
visualization, fast similarity search and chemical neighborhood ana-
lysis for retrieved hits. The software is freely available for academic
laboratories.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the growing number of academic centers (such as UCLA’s
Molecular Screening Shared Resources—MSSR, NIMH’s
Psychoactive Drug Screening Program—PDSP or Molecular
Libraries Screening Center Network—MLSCN) conducting
high-throughput screening (HTS) comes the need for processing
HTS results efﬁciently. Some of these centers have the potential
to screen up to 200000 compounds against several panels of
targets (e.g. GPCRs, kinases). As a result, signiﬁcant amounts
of screening data are generated, which require extensive manage-
ment and analysis. Several commercial software packages (e.g.
Spotﬁre by TIBCO, Vortex by DOTMATICS) are available to
conduct these data analysis and mining tasks, but these are rela-
tively expensive, have ﬁxed sets of features and are not necessar-
ily suited for academic structures and small biotech companies.
As a consequence, there is a need for freely available and easily
customizable software capable of visualizing and analyzing HTS
results with an eye toward more extensive and chemical analysis
using advances in cheminformatics for HTS data analysis
(Kiimmel and Parker, 2011).

2 FEATURES IMPLEMENTED IN NAVIGATOR

Different streams of information are involved and produced in HTS plat-
forms. The current version of HTS Navigator offers several important
capabilities for data storage, analysis and visualization.

2.1 Loading of multiple output ﬁles from different plate
readers

The Plate Loader module processes and organizes collections of output
ﬁles generated by multiple plate readers with different ﬁle format.
Information encoded in the ﬁles such as the multiple series of plates
with the measured responses, assay and target information, replicate
plates (or runs) and the associated compounds are automatically ex-
tracted. Users can select different types of conﬁgurations (e.g. one
target/multiple compounds per plate, one compound/multiple targets
per plate or multiple compounds/multiple targets per plate). Chemical
information (chemical IDs, names and structures—MOL and SDF
ﬁles) and additional external data such as target full names, assay infor-
mation or users” comments can also be uploaded. In addition, the Plate
Designer module gives users the opportunity to create their own plate
setup (e. g. four speciﬁc wells on each plate with reference compounds or a
given row or column for target baselines only).

2.2 Create, append and update HTS data matrix

Navigator allows users to upload a large number of plates within the
same project, which drastically facilitates raw data processing. As
shown in Figure l, Navigator automatically computes the HTS data
matrix (i.e. tested chemicals versus targets) with different normalization
and curation options. Each time the user uploads new plates, the HTS
data matrix is updated and the graphic user interface is dynamically
refreshed.

2.3 Navigation and identiﬁcation of screening hits

Browsing the whole set of tested compounds is facilitated with the navi-
gation panel (Fig. 1, left side) and a direct access to the distribution of
responses across all targets (Supplementary Fig. SlA). Compounds with
high experimental responses are easily detected. At any time, users have
direct access to all information related to the selected case (target, com-
pound, run, plate, potency with different options for baselines).
Moreover, the HTS Hit Picker located on the right panel of Navigator
(Fig. I) automatically identiﬁes all compounds with an experimental re-
sponse higher or equal to a user-deﬁned threshold (e.g. 10-fold activity
increase, IC50< 100 nM) so that users can rapidly analyze the most active
compounds without spending a lot of time browsing the HTS matrix
manually. Dual thresholds can also be activated for ﬁltering out com-
pounds with dual-selective polypharmacology.

2.4 Baseline visualization and correction factors

As part of the analysis of retrieved HTS hits and more generally the
consistency of the different assays used in the HTS platform, Navigator
provides users with a complete and easy access to all target baselines
obtained within a project. Analyzing baselines is essential to compute
accurate responses calculated from the averaged baseline responses by
minimizing plate variability and detecting errors. The HTS Baseline
Explorer module is illustrated in Supplementary Figure SlB. On the
top, there is a mean-centered distribution of target’s baselines across
plates, batches and runs. Outlier baselines (user-deﬁned threshold, 20
by default) are automatically identiﬁed and not considered for computing
the responses in the HTS matrix. Distribution of compounds’ responses
across all plates, batches and runs for the given target is also displayed for
a fast identiﬁcation of the most active compounds with adequate baseline.
The HTS baseline explorer dramatically facilitates the identiﬁcation of
incorrect and suspicious baselines and as a consequence false-positive and
false-negative hits.

2.5 Navigator is cheminformatics-ready

In addition to processing and analyzing screening data, Navigator incorp-
orates several useful cheminformatics options. A series of ﬁlters can be
used to identify subsets of compounds with certain properties, e.g. ranges
of molecular weight, numbers of H acceptors and donors, octanol—water
partition coefﬁcient (logPow) or the intrinsic water solubility (logS) com-
puted by QSAR models previously described (V arnek et al., 2008). Users
can also search for a given chemotype via its name (e.g. secondary amine,
nitro aromatics, tertiary alcohols) or substructure search. All compounds
containing a speciﬁc chemical moiety are highlighted and colored in the
dataset panel so one can browse HTS results for those compounds only.
The sets of compounds can also be visualized using the ADDAGRA
dataset graph module (Fourches and Tropsha, 2013). Some key elements
of our chemical data curation workﬁow (Fourches et al., 2010) are dir-
ectly included in Navigator, especially the neighborhood checker and
duplicate ﬁnder enabling a fast identiﬁcation of duplicated structures,
isomers and stereoisomers. Chemical similarity is computed based on
ISIDA fragments (V arnek et al., 2005) and standard Tanimoto similarity
coefﬁcient (W illett, 2010). We recently tested the usefulness of this feature
when analyzing a large library of 17 000 compounds bought from differ-
ent suppliers and tested against the same panel of cytochrome P450 en-
zymes (V eith et al., 2009). The analysis of some of these duplicates
showed serious discrepancies between experimental bioactivity proﬁles
(Fourches et al., 2013). Details concerning this analysis will be published
elsewhere.

3 CONCLUSIONS

HTS Navigator has been developed to efﬁciently process and
analyze the diverse data streams produced by HTS platforms.
This software was not conceived or designed to compete with
commercial software incorporating multiple features demanded
by (and adapted for) pharmaceutical companies. Nevertheless,
the HTS Navigator includes many important capabilities for
managing, processing and analyzing HTS data. Speciﬁcally,
Navigator is capable of (i) efﬁciently storing, processing and
managing large amounts of chemical and biological data, (ii)
automatically identifying hits as well as false-positives and is
(iii) cheminformatics-ready with integrated tools for data cur-
ation, neighborhood analysis and advanced searches based on
chemical similarity and substructural fragments. Importantly,
HTS Navigator is freely accessible for academic laboratories
and easily customizable for emerging needs.

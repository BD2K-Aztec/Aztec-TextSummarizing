ABSTRACT

Motivation: Combinatorial interactions of transcription factors with
cis-regulatory elements control the dynamic progression through suc-
cessive cellular states and thus underpin all metazoan development.
The construction of network models of cis-regulatory elements, there-
fore, has the potential to generate fundamental insights into cellular
fate and differentiation. Haematopoiesis has long served as a model
system to study mammalian differentiation, yet modelling based on
experimentally informed cis-regulatory interactions has so far been
restricted to pairs of interacting factors. Here, we have generated a
Boolean network model based on detailed cis-regulatory functional
data connecting 11 haematopoietic stem/progenitor cell (HSPC) regu-
lator genes.

Results: Despite its apparent simplicity, the model exhibits surpris-
ingly complex behaviour that we charted using strongly connected
components and shortest-path analysis in its Boolean state space.
This analysis of our model predicts that HSPCs display heterogeneous
expression patterns and possess many intermediate states that can
act as ‘stepping stones’ for the HSPC to achieve a final differentiated
state. Importantly, an external perturbation or ‘trigger’ is required to
exit the stem cell state, with distinct triggers characterizing maturation
into the various different lineages. By focusing on intermediate
states occurring during erythrocyte differentiation, from our model
we predicted a novel negative regulation of F|i1 by Gata1, which we
confirmed experimentally thus validating our model. In conclusion, we
demonstrate that an advanced mammalian regulatory network model
based on experimentally validated cis-regulatory interactions has
allowed us to make novel, experimentally testable hypotheses about
transcriptional mechanisms that control differentiation of mammalian
stem cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

The remarkable power of small combinations of transcription
factors to program and reprogram cellular phenotypes is exerted
through their ability to modulate the expression levels of their
target genes, typically in the range of a few hundred to a few
thousand genes. Despite the power of single transcription factors
to inﬂuence cell fate decisions, it is clear that the transcriptional
state of any given cell type is the result of interactions within
wider (transcriptional) regulatory networks. These regulatory
networks are composed of both the transcription factors (TFs)
and the cis—regulatory elements they are bound to (Davidson,
2006). Regulatory network reconstruction, therefore, requires
the identification of cis—regulatory elements, as well as the up-
stream factors that bind them.

Haematopoiesis (blood formation) has long served as a model
process for studying stem cells and represents the best character-
ized adult stem cell system with sophisticated puriﬁcation strate-
gies and functional stem cell assays. Transcriptional regulation is
a key factor controlling haematopoiesis (Miranda-Saavedra and
Gottgens, 2008), a fact underlined by the large number of TF
genes that play key roles in normal haematopoiesis and/or the
development of leukaemia (Gottgens, 2004). However, relatively
little is known about the way key regulators interact with each
other in forming the transcriptional networks controlling
haematopoiesis.

Identification and subsequent characterization of gene regula-
tory elements is central to the reconstruction of transcriptional
regulatory networks because these elements dictate the connect-
ivity and topology of transcriptional regulatory networks
(Davidson, 2006). Regulatory elements can be analysed using a
variety of assays, such as transfection assays of luciferase re-
porter constructs or chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) ana-
lysis to identify upstream regulators. However, the identification
of true in vivo activities of mammalian regulatory elements re-
quires the use of transgenic mouse systems. Regulatory elements
from 11 gene loci active in haematopoietic stem/progenitor cells
(HSPCs) have been validated using all the aforementioned
assays, including transgenic mice (Donaldson et al., 2005a;
Gottgens et al., 2002; Gottgens et al., 2004; Kobayashi-Osaki
et al., 2005; Landry et al., 2008; Nottingham et al., 2007;

Hard-wired heterogeneity in blood stem cells

 

Wilson et al., 2009). This wealth of data, therefore, represents a
unique opportunity to (re)construct transcriptional network
models for developing blood stem cells.

Network modelling is increasingly recognized as a powerful
approach to deal with the complexity of biological processes,
including the intricate interactions between TFs (Georgescu
et al., 2008; Hu et al., 2007; Karlebach and Shamir, 2008;
Krumsiek et al., 2011; Spooner et al., 2009; Thoms et al.,
2011). Most of the current experimental data describing the func-
tion of haematopoietic TFs are of a qualitative nature (e.g.
Gatal and Scl together activate Scl expression), which limits
the choice of possible modelling approaches. However, the accu-
mulated knowledge of regulatory interactions (Foster et al.,
2009; Swiers et al., 2006) contains experimentally validated in-
formation on the topology of regulatory sub-circuits, including
positive and negative feedback loops, which are important for
maintenance of both the stem cell phenotype (Pimanda et al.,
2007) and differentiation into different mature blood cell types
(Sieweke and Graf, 1998). An important challenge for regulatory
network reconstruction is to devise models that can represent the
dynamic interactions between important sub-circuits and repre-
sent the changes in gene expression when cells are undergoing
differentiation.

Importantly, experimentally deﬁned regulatory hierarchies
based on regulatory elements up to now largely represent a
static view, which, in the case of blood stem cell formation is
centred on a single time point in transgenic mouse assays (activ-
ity within the dorsal aorta region and foetal liver of the mid-
gestation mouse embryo). Here, we have generated a network
model based on extensive experimental data with the goal to
better understand how core stem cell network circuits are incor-
porated into the wider dynamic system of blood stem cell
development and differentiation. Through the modelling of
steady-states and dynamic network behaviour, we were able to
identify speciﬁc genes and feedback loops within the network
that are likely key players in cellular decision making, such as
the dynamic processes of stem cell maintenance and/or differen-
tiation. Moreover, our analysis revealed heterogeneous gene
expression states within undifferentiated blood stem cells, as
well as accurately captured perturbations required to differenti-
ate HSPCs along a speciﬁc lineage. Importantly, based on our
modelling results, we made a hypothesis that Gatal negatively
regulates Flil, which we validated experimentally using tran-
scriptional assays, thus providing new insights into the dynamic
nature of regulatory networks controlling differentiation of
blood stem cells into erythroid cells.

2 METHODS

2.1 Experimental

A reporter construct carrying the luciferase gene driven by Fli1 enhancer
was introduced into the HPC7 cells (a murine haematopoietic progenitor
cell line) by electroporation, and luciferase activity measured as described
previously (Gottgens et al., 1997). The Flil enhancer reporter construct
has been described previously (Donaldson et al., 2005b). Results of trans-
activation experiments were analysed as described previously (Bockamp
et al., 1998). Individual experiments were performed in triplicates on at
least two different days.

2.2 Boolean modelling

In Boolean modelling of a gene regulatory network (GRN), a gene can
exist in only two expression states: active and inactive (represented by
Boolean 1 and 0, respectively); and the interaction between genes/proteins
is represented using Boolean logic functions, such as AND, OR, BUFF
and NOT (Davidich and Bornholdt, 2008; Davidson et al., 2002; Garg
et al., 2009; Li et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007). Advantages of Boolean
modelling approach over more traditional continuous modelling
approaches based on ordinary differential equations is that kinetic par-
ameters are not required to deﬁne interactions between the genes (or
proteins). However, such a simpliﬁcation comes at the cost of discret-
ization of the gene expression (or gene activity) to only two expression
levels, namely, present or absent. Nevertheless, Boolean modelling can
efﬁciently capture the required dynamics of a GRN and has been suc-
cessfully applied in the past to model various biological phenomena, such
as cellular differentiation and embryo development (Davidich and
Bornholdt, 2008; Davidson 61 al., 2002; Li et al., 2004; Smith et al.,
2007). We used Boolean logic functions AND, OR, BUFF, IAND and
NOT as described previously (Garg et al., 2008, 2009; Kauffman et al.,
2003; Klamt et al., 2006; Mendoza and Xenarios, 2006) to represent the
interactions between the genes in the GRN. A Boolean network corres-
ponding to a sample GRN is shown in Supplementary Figure S1. We use
the Boolean modelling toolbox Geanis to compute attractors of
Boolean functions mapped GRN and perform in Silica gene perturbation
experiments (Garg et al., 2008). In this work, we use the fully asynchron-
ous approach to model the time evolution and compute steady-states of
the haematopoietic gene regulatory network (shown in Fig. 1A). The
following three assumptions are made in the fully asynchronous model-
ling approach: (i) at most one gene can change its state (be updated) in a
single step. (ii) At least one gene changes its state in a single step unless
none of the genes can change their expression levels. (iii) Every gene is
equally likely to change its state in a given step. With these constraints,
every state can have potentially N successor states, N being the number of
genes in the GRN, where each successor state differs from the present
state in only one gene expression. The fully asynchronous models have
been used often in the literature (Mangla et al., 2010; Thomas, 1991;
Thomas et al., 1995).

2.3 State-space analysis

Strongly connected components SCCs in the state space were calculated
using Tarjan’s algorithm. Stable states were identiﬁed as terminal SCCs
(TSCCs), i.e. an SCC with no outgoing edges.

Shortest traversable paths in the state space were calculated using
Dijkstra’s algorithm. A naive brute force analysis (sufﬁcient to analyse
all ~900 000 paths found) was performed to ﬁnd shortest traversable
paths originating from the experimentally known HSPC expression pat-
tern and leading to the experimentally known cell-type expression pattern
states of interest. A similar analysis was performed for the state nearest to
any of the sub-states in the HSPC TSCC leading to the cell type states.

Supplementary Figure S3 summarizes the procedure taken here in an
overview of our analysis pipeline, starting from the experimental inter-
actions included in the model.

3 RESULTS
3.1 A transcriptional regulatory network model for blood
stem cells

Systematic curation of previously published results on haemato-
poietic regulatory elements allowed us to construct the ﬁrst com-
prehensive regulatory network model based on 11 fully validated
regulatory elements linking together 11 transcription factors, all
of which are active in early HSPCs (see Supplementary Table S1

prehensive ciS-regulatory information. (A) Diagram of the haematopoi-
etic gene regulatory network with logical functions between genes
(ellipses) encoded directly by explicit transitions (squares). Activating
interactions are shown as blue arrows, repressing interactions in red
with ’ﬁat heads’. All regulatory information encoded in this model can
be found in Supplementary Table S2. (B) UPGMA (Unweighted Pair
Group Method with Arithmetic mean) dendrogram based on hamming
distance between cell-type—speciﬁc gene expression patterns shows that
the 11 network model genes are sufﬁcient to uniquely identify each of the
cell types considered. Labels indicate the cell type names and the corres-
ponding binary expression patterns. Note that this dendrogram should
not be confused with the developmental tree; the latter is shown schemat-
ically in grey lines in Figure 3

for details on the 11 genes). Figure 1 shows the resulting 11 gene
regulatory network. Importantly, as all 11 regulatory elements
have been studied extensively using DNA/protein—binding
assays, as well as reporter gene assays of wild-type and mutant
elements, both the direction and value of each of the regulatory
interactions is known with certainty. Moreover, protein—protein
interactions curated from the literature were included, such as
the well-characterized Gatal—Pu.l interactions whenever their
value (activatory/inhibitory) was known (see Supplementary
Table S2 for details).

The resulting network was modelled as logical interactions
encoding the activating and/or inhibitory links, including the
speciﬁc combinations in which particular interactions occur
(e.g. Gata2 and Scl together activate Eto2). This logical model
was implemented in advanced Boolean notation, as described in
Section 2 and shown in Figure 1 (see Supplementary Table S2 for
a full network description). Several observations are noteworthy:

(i) a network of 11 genes with three types of possible interactions
(activatory, inhibitory and none) could adopt in excess of 1050
possible network topologies. It would, therefore, simply be un-
feasible to perform modelling analysis using all possible topolo-
gies and then work backwards to identify the likely correct
topology. (ii) At the heart of the network lies the triad of Scl,
Gata2 and Flil, which is characterized by extensive positive feed-
back loops, but negative regulatory interactions are common out-
side this central triad. (iii) We have 11 genes connected by 47 links
(an average degree of 4.3) forming a densely connected network.
Within this network, we can identify an even more densely con-
nected core consisting of Erg, Gata2, SCI and Flil with an average
degree of 8.5. Furthermore, Gata2 and Scl connect out to most
other genes, and nearly always operate together as a dimer.

3.2 Network genes are expressed dynamically during
haematopoiesis

In order for a network model to be useable as a predictive tool,
the behaviour of its component genes needs to be assessed using
available experimental data. We, therefore, explored the expres-
sion patterns of the 11 component genes in primary haematopoi-
etic cell types. To this end, we took advantage of two published
datasets: a single-cell gene expression proﬁling study comparing
haematopoietic stem with progenitor cells (Ramos et al., 2006)
and the haematopoietic ﬁngerprints database, a collection of ex-
pression proﬁling data for HSPCs, as well as nine differentiated
lineages (Chambers et al., 2007). Based on the available litera-
ture, all our HSPC network genes except Gatal should be ex-
pressed in the most immature stem cell population, which is
precisely what we found when interrogating the two expression
proﬁling datasets. Moreover, Gatal expression was found in the
immediate progeny of the most immature progenitors, e.g. the
multipotent progenitor population. In contrast to the ubiquitous
expression of our 11 genes in the stem/progenitor compartment,
mature blood lineages only express subsets of the 11 genes that
make up the HSPC network ranging from 2 of 11 in activated
CD8 T-cells to 7 of 11 in granulocytes. Of note, different mature
cell types express different subsets of genes, which prompted us
to investigate whether this variability would be sufﬁcient to at
least partially reconstruct a haematopoietic differentiation tree.
Indeed, clustering based on expression of these 11 genes was
sufﬁcient to capture key aspects of the haematopoietic differen-
tiation tree (Fig. 1B). Our HSPC network model may, therefore,
not only reveal properties of the stem cell state but also allow us
to interrogate potential mechanisms and external stimuli that
direct stem cell differentiation into speciﬁc mature lineages.

3.3 Dynamic modelling of the network predicts
heterogeneous HSPC expression states

Having generated a complex vertebrate transcriptional regula-
tory network model based on comprehensive experimental evi-
dence, we next performed dynamic modelling analysis to explore
whether any predicted network behaviour would allow us to gain
new insights into blood stem cell biology. Dynamic modelling
revealed that the experimentally validated network topology
allows for three stable states (Fig. 2A):

(i) All genes are off (S—3-l),

Fig. 2. Steady-state analysis and comparison with expression patterns in 10
haematopoietic cell types. (A) The relation between the expression patterns
of the 10 major cell types and the steady-states from the network model is
shown by means of hierarchical clustering. Cell types are identiﬁed by their
names. Steady-states are labelled with ‘S’ and two numbers; the ﬁrst indi-
cates the steady-state (1, 2 or 3) and the second the sub-states within the
steady-state (up to 32 for steady-state ‘S-1’). Red, expression present; blue,
expression absent. (B) Heterogeneous gene expression observed in single-
cell microarray experiments of 12 individual HSPCs for all genes in our

correlation of averaged gene expression activity from the 12 single-cell
proﬁles from (B) compared with average gene activity from the modelled

(ii) Only Gatal and Scl are expressed (S-2—l) and
(iii) An interconnected set of 32 expression states with multiple
genes active but Gatal always repressed (S-l-l to 32).

To explore whether these steady-states matched observed cell
states, we next performed clustering of expression patterns
from our stable states together with the expression patterns in
the 10 haematopoietic cell types. The results shown in Figure 2A
indicate that steady-state S-3-l corresponds to a non-haemato-
poietic cell. The steady-state S-2—l clusters with the erythroid cell
proﬁle (Fig. 2A), but they are not identical. Importantly, how-
ever, the hamming distance is much smaller if we take into ac-
count the fact that the benchmark expression data of Chambers
et al. (2007) that we used here represents a mixture of mature and

immature erythrocytes. It has been shown that during ﬁnal mat-
uration, erythrocytes will downregulate Erg, Hhex and Runx1
(Lorsbach et al., 2004; Merryweather-Clarke et al., 2011; Seita
et al., 2012; Wong et al., 2011).

Most interesting, however, is stable state S-l, which is com-
posed of 32 interconnected internal states, including a state that
matches the expected pattern for HSPCs. This suggests that the
precursor HSPC is not a homogeneous cell population, but
rather is composed of cells in different stages of activation.
Furthermore, there is a striking correlation between gene expres-
sion proﬁling results from single HSPCs (Ramos et al., 2006,
summarized in Fig. 2B) and the heterogeneous states predicted
by our network, as those genes predicted by our model to be
stably present were consistently found expressed in a high
proportion of single-cell proﬁling experiments, whereas genes
predicted to be variable (or ‘oscillatory’) in this stable state by
our model were consistently found expressed in fewer single cells
(Fig. 2C). This analysis, therefore, not only demonstrates that
our knowledge-driven network topology is compatible with ex-
pression patterns observed in HSPCs in viva but also suggests
that expression of genes, such as Gata2, prml, Erg and Eto2 is
heterogeneous in HSPCs and may deﬁne intermediate states
within this cell population.

3.4 Modelling state transitions reveals possible
differentiation triggers and a potential role for
expression heterogeneity in stem cell function

Analysis of transitions between different steady-states in the
model can be useful to predict experimental conditions for cells
to differentiate out of the HSPC state. We analysed all possible
state transitions in the context of our model. Most theoretically
possible transitions cannot occur with our experimentally in-
formed network topology; of all 2048224 194 304 possible
paths between the 2048 states in our model, only 895 751
(21%) can be traversed within our network. This result is not
unexpected, as cell types should be stable states, and network
wiring would be expected to constrain ﬂexibility of regulatory
states and thus stabilize cell types. There are no paths out of the
HSPC state, which is consistent with the HSPC being a stable cell
type within the context of a regulatory network based on HSPC
transcription factors.

To further classify the transitions, we next mapped all shortest
paths onto the known paths of the haematopoietic hierarchy
connecting the 10 cell types proﬁled by Chambers et al. (2007).
This allowed us to classify these permitted transitions in our
model into three categories:

(i) There are 11 transition paths that follow the developmen-
tal tree to the mature cell types, and all start with the
activation or repression of one or more genes by some
external stimulus (i.e. not by any of the other genes in
the network). We call these transitions ‘on path’, and
they are shown in Figure 3. The external activation/repres-
sion out of the HSPC state we call the ‘initial trigger’ or
‘push’, with a ‘push distance’ indicating the number of
genes that need this activation/repression; these are also
shown in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. Analysis of state transitions. Developmental routes (in grey) be-
tween the major cell types in the developmental tree, with corresponding
‘on path’ transitions (leading to mature cell types) observed in the mod-
elled network state space indicated as arrows (in colours; numbers indi-
cate path lengths). The ‘on path’ transitions all start with an external
trigger from the HSPC cell-type state; this trigger, or ‘push’, changes
the state of one (‘+1’) or more (‘+2’, ‘+3’ and ‘+4’) genes. Similar
‘pushes’ are needed for transitions out of the CD4 and CD8 cell type
to their respective activated cell types

(ii) There are a further 11 transition paths in the reverse dir-
ection, which we call ‘upstream’; these reach the HSPC
state without requiring a ‘push’ (Supplementary Table S3).

(iii) There are an additional 18 transition paths that make
direct connections between differentiated cell types.
These transition paths may provide a way to cross-differ-
entiate between mature cell types without ﬁrst having to
de—differentiate into a stem cell as an intermediate step. We
call this third category of transitions ‘cross—path’
(Supplementary Table S3).

This analysis, therefore, demonstrates that our network topology
constrains the majority of transitions to be either ‘on path’ or
‘cross-path’; just over half of these transitions are between bio-
logically similar/related cell types, such as monocytes and
granulocytes.

We determined for our model, which states closest to the
HSPC state connect to each of the mature cell types. For ex-
ample, for the erythrocyte state, there is a state at a distance of
two from HSPC that can differentiate into an erythroblast in
another ﬁve steps (Fig. 3 and Supplementary Table S3). This
observation corresponds to the notion that the transition from
HSPC to erythrocyte would need a ‘push’ or ‘trigger’ of repress-
ing Flil and activating Gatal, thereby shifting the state two steps
away from the HSPC, from which point the system can progress
without further interventions into erythrocyte. Examining the
other transitions in the development tree, it turns out that all
transitions out of HSPC towards a mature cell type need a
‘push’ ranging from +1 (Granulocyte) to +4 (CD4 T-cells and
NK cells) as is shown in Figure 3 (Supplementary Table S3 for
details). We performed the same analysis for stable state S-l,

using as a starting point any of its 32 sub-states (including the
HSPC; see also Fig. 2A). Interestingly, for each target mature
cell-type state, we found there exists a transition path involving
either a shorter ‘push’ distance, or a shorter transition path after
the ‘push’ (see Supplementary Table S3 for details). The hetero-
geneous stem cell state in our model thus enables more efﬁcient
transitions towards different mature cell types. This observation
is consistent with a role for expression heterogeneity in stem cells
in terms of mediating multi-lineage differentiation potential.

Supplementary Table S3 shows that for speciﬁc differentiation
directions different transition states can be involved, but at each
‘push distance’, +l, +2, +3 and +4 from the HSPC state, only a
single-transition state is used. For example, monocyte, CD8 and
B-cell share the same transition state (at +3 from the HSPC), as
do NK and CD4 (+4). Taken together, this analysis supports the
notion that the HSPC state is highly stabilized when encoded
using our experimentally informed network topology, and that
the system ﬁrst needs to be perturbed to initiate differentiation
into speciﬁc lineages. Intriguingly, this notion of destabilization
has also been put forward in the experimental study of Pina er al.
(2012), who observe that early exit of HSPCs from the self-re-
newal state is not yet linked with speciﬁc gene expression changes
that would commit the cell to differentiate down a single trajec-
tory. The analysis of dynamic transitions in a regulatory network
model, such as ours, permits the formulation of hypotheses on
how this destabilization may be triggered, and how it may lead to
subsequent entry into commitment towards the different
lineages.

3.5 Increasing the ‘power’ of Gatal results in a ‘one-step’
trigger for differentiation towards erythrocyte

We chose the differentiation pathway towards erythroid cells for
further investigation because (i) the pathway is well characterized
at the experimental level; (ii) it has been the subject of
modelling approaches based on simple two-gene interactions
(Chickarmane er al., 2009; Roeder and Glauche, 2006); and
(iii) it connects two stable states in our modelling based on our
11 gene network.

Of note, experimental evidence suggests that a single ‘trigger’
or ‘push’ (e. g. ectopic expression of Gatal) would be sufﬁcient to
drive immature blood progenitors towards an erythroid fate
(Heyworth er al., 2002; Kulessa er al., 1995). However, as
noted earlier in the text, our modelling results suggest that
HSPC cells need to undergo two-state changes or ‘pushes’ as a
trigger to differentiate into erythroid cells. We considered that
there might be two possible explanations for this discrepancy
with our model: (i) Gatal regulates a protein not present in
our network, and this can generate this second ‘push’ or
(ii) there is a missing link in our wiring diagram, which when
introduced would increase the ‘power’ of Gatal so that its
ectopic expression would become a single push differentiation
trigger. Interrogating the ﬁrst of these two possibilities is poten-
tially rather speculative, but the second could be readily
explored.

We therefore considered potentially missing network links
from our current topology. In particular, we extended our
model by introducing the possible repression of Flil by Gatal
based on the rationale that the Flil regulatory element is

structurally similar to the Gata2 element, which is known to be
repressed by Gatal (Grass er al., 2003). Interestingly, just intro-
ducing this single additional repressive link elevated Gatal to a
‘single push’ trigger for erythroid differentiation. Following on
from this modelling result, we investigated whether Gatal was
indeed able to repress activity of the Flil enhancer in blood stem/
progenitor cells. To test this, the haematopoietic progenitor cell
line HPC7 was electroporated with a luciferase reporter con-
struct containing the Flil enhancer together with either an
empty control plasmid or a Gatal overexpression construct. As
shown in Figure 4A, co-transfection of the Gatal expression
plasmid resulted in signiﬁcant repression of the activity of the
Flil enhancer construct, thus demonstrating that Gatal is indeed
able to negatively regulate expression of Flil. Furthermore, ana-
lysis of Gatal ChIP-Seq data in primary fetal liver blood pro-
genitor cells co-expressing Gatal and Flil (NCBI GEO
Accession GSM923586) showed direct binding of Gatal to the
+12kb HSPC enhancer region, as well as the Flil promoter
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

Network transition modelling, therefore, allowed us to predict
a previously unrecognized network link, which we were able to
validate experimentally. The revised network diagram is shown
in Figure 4B with the new repressive link indicated by dashed
lines. Interestingly, including repression of Flil by Gatal did not
alter the steady-states of our model, illustrating how some net-
work links speciﬁcally inﬂuence transitions between states rather
than the states themselves.

4 DISCUSSION

The construction of accurate regulatory network models is an
essential prerequisite towards gaining a systems-level understand-
ing of the transcriptional control of complex cellular behaviour.
Here, we have generated a regulatory network model for HSPCs
based on comprehensive experimental data, which represents the
most complex mammalian network model to date anchored on
cis—regulatory functional data. This experimentally validated net-
work topology generated three stable states, one of which was
composed of 32 interconnected internal states, including the one
that matched the stem cell expression pattern. Binary on/off ex-
pression of an 11 gene network could theoretically generate 2048
possible expression states. The fact that we identify only 34 states
thus highlights how network modelling based on experimental
data can serve to reduce the complexity of analysing multi-gene
interactions. Analysis of state-space transitions identiﬁed poten-
tial triggers that might mediate exit from the stem cell state and
highlighted a previously unrecognized inhibition of Flil by Gatal,
which was subsequently validated experimentally.

4.1 Experimentally validated network models—insights
and open questions

Regulatory network topology determines the nature of possible
regulatory states, as well as the possible transitions paths be-
tween them. The experimental evidence used f or model construc-
tion is, therefore, critical. Previous studies in lower model
organisms have made extensive use of comprehensive gene regu-
latory experimental data anchored on the interactions of up-
stream regulators with speciﬁc gene regulatory sequences
(Davidson, 2006; Davidson er al., 2002; Smith et al., 2007). By
contrast, recent network models for mammalian systems, includ-
ing blood (Krumsiek er al., 2011) relied on less explicit experi-
mental data. Direct experimental knowledge of the interactions
within our network model not only provides high conﬁdence in
the modelling but also offers an opportunity to consider the
possible consequences if our experimental knowledge was more
limited. For example, without the repression of Erg by Scl there
would only be 16 rather than 32 internal sub-states in steady-
state 1. Importantly, introducing the novel interaction generates
internal states that are closer to some of the differentiated states.
Consequently, the number of internal states that a stem cell can
‘explore’ increases with a concurrent decrease in the number of
external triggers required to move out of the HSPC state to
differentiate.

Another notable observation is that most repressive inter-
actions in the network (Fig. l) arise from pairs of genes. A
common theme here is that co-regulators, such as Eto2 and
prml, are thought to bind DNA indirectly through interactions

with conventional transcription factors, such as SCI and Gatal,
and by doing so convert the latter from activators to repressors.
Interestingly, in our network, these negative co-regulators are
themselves activated by the conventional TFs, thus generating
an abundance of incoherent feed-forward loops within the wider
network. Simple negative feedback loops have previously been
proposed to result in oscillatory expression of important cell fate
regulators (Hirata er al., 2002; Lahav er al., 2004). To better
understand the potential for oscillatory behaviour in increasingly
complex networks, future developments might need to include
building more ﬁne-grained models, such as the use of Petri nets,
which can be readily adapted to move from a Boolean range of
values towards discrete multi-valued expression levels (Bonzanni
et al., 2009a, b).

Within the context of our 11 gene HSPC network topology,
several expression states that correspond to the differentiated cell
types shown in Figure 3 can automatically revert to the stem cell
state, suggesting a potential for spontaneous reversion of differ-
entiated cells to the immature stem cell phenotype (details in
Supplementary Table S3). In a sense, this may merely be a
reﬂection of the fact that our experimentally informed HSPC
network topology generated a stable HSPC attractor.
However, it also suggests that ‘commitment features’ that
would block these regressions, may be missing from our network.
A recent model of the myeloid lineage (Krumsiek er al., 2011),
which did not include the stem cell state, found the mature cell
types (erythroid, megakaryocyte, monocyte and granulocyte) to
be attractor states. A likely explanation for the contrast between
this study and our ﬁndings may be that rather than excluding the
stem cell state, we explicitly focused on regulatory interactions
within HSPCs. Multiple positive feedback loops, therefore, sta-
bilize the HSPC state in our model, whereas the external triggers
that ‘break’ some of these feedback loops and thus induce dif-
ferentiation remain unknown. It is likely that some of these com-
mitment events will transmit extracellular signals to the nucleus,
to modulate epigenetic processes that regulate the availability of
regulatory regions for transcription factor binding. For example,
epigenetic silencing of a given regulatory element could prevent
access of upstream factors with the consequence of ‘locking in’
the differentiated state.

4.2 The ‘stem cell state’—a moving target?

Comprehensive exploration of the state space dictated by our
experimentally validated HSPC network topology resulted in a
set of 32 interconnected states, which together constitute a stable
state with a gene expression pattern consistent with HSPCs.
However, only a single internal state in the HSPC attractor
matched expression levels of all HSPC associated genes, whereas
all others expressed different subsets of genes, suggesting possible
heterogeneity between discrete expression states. The heteroge-
neous steady-state predicted by our model might at ﬁrst have
been considered an artefact because of either the unavoidably
partial knowledge we have about the system, or introduced by
the high level of discretization used (i.e. from potentially continu-
ous expression levels to Boolean values). However, we believe
that on the contrary, our results may provide potentially import-
ant new insights into the nature of transcriptional control of stem
cells and differentiation as outlined below: ﬁrst, the striking

correlation between gene expression proﬁling results from
single HSPCs and the heterogeneous states predicted by our net-
work (Fig. 2C). Moreover, single-cell analysis of highly puriﬁed
murine HSPCs using digital polymerase chain reaction (PCR)
assays (\Narren er al., 2006) also showed heterogeneous tran-
scription factor expression in individual HSPCs. Taken together,
these observations suggest that the stem cell state is composed of
a discrete set of sub-states with a substantial degree of oscilla-
tions in gene expression, which includes genes thought of as cen-
tral regulators of stem cell fate. Of note, this concept is largely
consistent with the recently introduced theory of non-genetic
micro-heterogeneity in multi-potential stem cell populations
(Huang, 2009).

It might at ﬁrst glance seem difﬁcult to reconcile such oscilla-
tions and the resultant transcriptional heterogeneity with the
model of multi-lineage priming. This latter concept was founded
on the observation that some HSPCs display low-level co-expres-
sion of cytokine receptor genes afﬁliated with divergent differen-
tiation pathways (Hu et al., 1997). Consequently, HSPCs have
widely been thought of as highly promiscuous with widespread
co-expression rather than only expressing subsets of genes.
However, in addition to demonstrating the potential for multi-
lineage priming, the original article in 1997 (Hu et al.) also found
heterogeneous expression of stem cell afﬁliated genes when ana-
lysed at the single-cell level. Both multi—lineage priming of cyto-
kine receptor genes and expression of HSPC afﬁliated
transcription factors, therefore, show cellular heterogeneity con-
sistent with oscillating expression in individual HSPCs. Based on
the results presented in this article, cellular heterogeneity of
multi-lineage priming may, therefore, be hardwired into HSPC
regulatory networks rather than being a consequence of low-
level, non-speciﬁc gene expression noise as had been speculated
previously. This in turn would suggest that characterization of
the underlying mechanisms will provide novel insights into the
functional role of multi-lineage priming as a key mediator of
differentiation. Rather than there being a ‘stem cell continuum’,
the regulatory space within which a stem cell can move may be
constrained where a given differentiation trajectory requires pas-
sage through a number of speciﬁc intermediate states.

Other recent work also challenges the notion of a stem cell
continuum in multi-potential stem cell populations and multi-
lineage priming, but instead offers a scenario with multiple
‘discordant’ entries into lineages and subsequent ‘coalescence’
into mature expression patterns (Pina er al., 2012). In analogy
to this, we see a heterogeneous stem cell state that offers several
routes into distinct lineage-speciﬁc transition states, which would
be consistent with the notion of ‘multiple discordant entries’. Our
model also suggests the possibility of triggering cross-lineage
transitions, which may be exceedingly rare in normal cells but
have been observed experimentally (Di Tullio et al., 2011) and in
leukaemias (van Wering er al., 1995). For example, a leukaemia
may be of myeloid phenotype when a patient ﬁrst presents, but
of lymphoid phenotype at relapse (Chucrallah er al., 1995; Stass
er al., 1984). A better understanding of cross-lineage transition
paths may, therefore, aid to develop therapies for relapsed pa-
tients, who currently have a poor prognosis. Cross-lineage tran-
sitions may also be exploited in the ﬁeld of regenerative medicine,
where protocols are being developed to for example make
macrophages out of B-cells (Bussmann er al., 2009).

Hard-wired heterogeneity in blood stem cells

 

The lack of explicit commitment in the mature cell types in our
model, as discussed earlier in the text, is consistent with the
notion that entry into a lineage may at ﬁrst be reversible. This
is in line with ﬁndings from a recent model of the myeloid lineage
that exhibits a heterogeneous entry into mature cell type attrac-
tor states (Krumsiek et al., 2011). In many cases, the particular
order of external triggers applied in our model to exit the HSPC
state seems not to be critical. That is, along the ‘pushes’ to dif-
ferent distances we do not observe overlap, except for where both
lead to the same intermediate state (Supplementary Table S3).
Similarly multiple transition paths to mature cell type states
show order-independence of individual genes switched, consist-
ent with the notion of network coalescence (Tipping et al., 2009).
Thus, the emerging picture seems to be that, starting from a
heterogeneous HSPC stable state, external stimuli may trigger
different initial responses within individual cells in a heteroge-
neous stem cell population, but ultimately resolve into a clearly
demarcated mature cell state.

4.3 Discrete stem cell states and differentiation triggers

As the stem cell state space is composed of a set of regulatory
states with inter-conversions between them dictated by the net-
work topology, the question arises to what extent knowledge of
network wiring may increase our ability to manipulate stem cell
fate choices. In this study, we show that speciﬁc differentiation
triggers can be modelled successfully and inform speciﬁc hypoth-
eses for subsequent experimental testing. Importantly, speciﬁc
sub-states within the stem cell state are closer to certain down-
stream cellular fates than others; indeed fewer activating triggers
(‘pushes’) are needed and shorter transition paths exist when
starting from these sub-states. This in turn suggests that the dis-
tribution of stem cell internal states has the potential to inﬂuence
the propensity of a stem cell to choose between divergent differ-
entiation choices. A mechanistic understanding of the underlying
processes would have important scientiﬁc and clinical implica-
tions. For example, altering the levels of Gata2 has recently been
shown to affect the ratio between cycling and quiescent HSPCs
(Tipping et al., 2009), providing direct experimental evidence that
levels for one of the factors shown to be oscillating in our net-
work model are associated with phenotypically identiﬁable sub-
states of HSPCs. From a translational point of view, in vitro
production of speciﬁc blood cell types from HSPCs has the po-
tential to provide safer and cheaper alternatives to blood trans-
fusions. However, directed differentiation in vitro remains
disappointingly inefﬁcient, suggesting that knowledge of the
underlying regulatory networks is critical for the development
of new protocols. Finally, treatment responses for patients carry-
ing the same leukaemogenic mutations can be different. As many
leukaemia oncogenes cause a differentiation block of early
progenitors, it is possible that this block may occur in different
‘sub-states’ of the stem cell compartment in different patients,
suggesting that a deeper understanding of these sub-states may
provide novel treatment options.

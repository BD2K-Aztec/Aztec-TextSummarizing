ABSTRACT

Motivation: Considerable attention has been directed in recent years
toward the development of methods for the contextual analysis of
expression data using interaction networks. Of particular interest has
been the identification of active subnetworks by detecting regions
enriched with differential expression. In contrast, however, very little
effort has been made toward the application of comparable methods
to other types of high-throughput data.

Results: Here, we propose a new method based on co-clustering
that is specifically designed for the exploratory analysis of large-
scale, RNAi-based functional screens. We demonstrate our approach
by applying it to a genome-scale dataset aimed at identifying host
factors of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV). In addition
to recovering known cellular modules relevant to HCV infection,
the results enabled us to identify new candidates and formulate
biological hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for a
number of them. For example, our analysis indicated that HCV, similar
to other enveloped viruses, exploits elements within the endosomal
pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate assembly and
release. This echoed a number of recent studies which showed that
the ESCRT—III complex is essential to productive infection.

1 INTRODUCTION

An important challenge in the analysis of high—throughput datasets,
such as transcriptomic and proteomic data, is the integration of
prior knowledge in their interpretation. One class of methods that
has arisen to address this challenge is gene set analysis (GSA)
(Dinu et al., 2009; Goeman and Buhlmann, 2007; Liu et al.,
2007). Motivated by the increasing body of evidence that cellular
responses are usually organized into pathways or active modules
(Hartwell et al., 1999; Vidal, 2001), GSA methods try to assess the
overall association between the phenotype of interest and known
groupings of genes, by comparing the latter with the data. Although
hugely successful, as evidenced by a large body of literature, GSA
suffers from a number of drawbacks. Probably foremost of these,
and somewhat ironic, is its reliance on predetermined gene sets.
As a consequence of this dependency, GSA cannot be expected

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

to discover novel pathways. In addition, with few exceptions
(see Massa et al., 2010; Tarca et al., 2009), GSA algorithms treat
pathways simply as sets; i.e. they completely ignore information
on the individual interactions between entities (e.g. topology). Such
information could potentially also be of use.

To complement the shortcomings of GSA, methods that try to
more generally integrate interaction with expression data, outside
the scope of canonical pathways, have emerged. We collectively
refer to these as signiﬁcant area search (SigArSearch) methods.
One of the earliest of these was the co—clustering approach by
Hanisch et al. (2002). In their paper, they proposed to cluster
genes based on a distance function that integrated measures of both
expression correlation and interaction network proximity. Almost
at the same time, Ideker et al. (2002) presented a method that
framed the contextual interpretation task as an optimization problem.
Speciﬁcally, they deﬁned a scoring function on subnetworks—
based on the data values of the genes included in a subgraph—and
employed a search algorithm to ﬁnd high scoring regions. Because
the underlying combinatorial problem, i.e. that of ﬁnding the
maximal—scoring connected subgraph with additive scores deﬁned
on the vertices, was proven to be NP—hard, the authors proposed a
heuristic strategy based on simulated annealing.

Similar to GSA, the interpretative power of SigArSearch is also
limited by the scope of the background knowledge/information that
is used (i.e. the interaction network). However, a key difference
between the two paradigms exists, owing to the different roles
that gene groups play in them. Whereas GSA requires that these
be speciﬁed beforehand, SigArSearch actually tries to infer such
modular relationships between genes directly (at least the ones
relevant to the current expression data), subject to the binary
relations encoded in the network. Thus, SigArSearch is potentially
able to discover new groupings, which could, for example,
correspond to uncharacterized protein complexes or pathways. This
capability is particularly relevant if the background network used
consists of, or includes, interactions taken from unbiased, large—scale
interaction screens (e.g. using Y2H or TAP/MS; see Shoemaker and
Panchenko, 2007 for a review of such methods).

The optimization framework introduced by Ideker et al.
(2002) for SigArSearch later inspired the development of several
improvements. For example, a number of groups proposed the use of
alternative heuristic search strategies, such as the greedy approaches
of Sohler et al. (2004) and Nacu et al. (2007). Others proposed
extensions to the scoring system, such as including scores deﬁned
on the edges (interactions) (Cabusora et al., 2005) instead of just
the vertices (genes). Subsequently, Dittrich et al. (2008) pointed out
that the existing methods (based on the optimization framework)

were heuristic in nature, and as such could not guarantee to identify
the maximally scoring subgraph. In light of this, they presented
an exact approach that was described as being able to deliver
provably optimal solutions in reasonable time, which worked by
reducing instances of the maximal subgraph problem to an integer—
linear program. Other recent developments include extensions to
the scoring system that incorporate measures of gene coexpression
(whereas previous methods only used the individual data values of
genes) (Guo et a1., 2007; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007), and an approach
based on random walks that forgoes the optimization paradigm
altogether (Komurov et a1., 2010). Although these methods are
already quite popular for use with expression data, applications to
other types of high—throughput datasets are still limited. In this study,
we present a new method, inspired by the co—clustering approach
of Hanisch et a1. (2002), that is speciﬁcally intended for use with
RNAi—based functional screens.

Functional studies in cultured cells were hampered in the past
by the lack of a powerful method for perturbing gene activities
(Echeverri and Perrimon, 2006). This changed with the discovery
of RNA interference (RNAi) and the subsequent development of
siRNA libraries aimed at targeting complete genomes for a number
of organisms (Birmingham et a1., 2009). Indeed, RNAi screens
have proven to be effective at identifying genes associated with
various biological processes, including cellular differentiation (Chia
et a1., 2010; Hu et a1., 2009; Zhao and Ding, 2007), cancer (Bauer
et a1., 2010; Wurdak et a1., 2010; Zender et a1., 2008), signaling
(Berns et a1., 2004; DasGupta et a1., 2005) and host—pathogen
interactions (Brass et a1., 2008, 2009; Li et a1., 2009; Tai et a1.,
2009; Zhou et a1., 2008). Although there are now well—deﬁned
computational approaches for the various stages of the primary
analysis of RNAi screens, including quality control (Zhang et a1.,
1999; Zhang, 2007b), normalization (Malo etal., 2006; Wiles etal.,
2008) and hit selection (Chung et a1., 2008; KOnig et a1., 2007;
Zhang, 2007a), the potential for methods that integrate interaction
information into the interpretation of the data is only starting to be
realized (see Wang et a1. 2009 and Bankhead et a1. 2009 for some
examples). In this study, we propose a new method for the contextual
interpretation of RNAi screens that works by co—clustering together
with interaction data.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

We demonstrate our approach by applying it to a genome—wide RNAi screen
for host factors of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Tai et a1.,
2009). The screen provided ‘fold change’ data, which represents the ratio
by which viral growth was inhibited or enhanced as a consequence of the
knockdown of a particular gene, as well as P—values. We were able to map
~18 000 of the knockdowns to ENTREZ records.

To serve as context for the analysis of the RNAi data, we assembled a
network by collecting interactions deﬁned in the STRING database (Jensen
et a1., 2009). Only those rated with at least a medium level of conﬁdence
(combined score30.4) were included. As with before, all identiﬁers were
mapped to ENTREZ records. Mapping information (Ensembl protein id to
Entrez gene id) was retrieved from ENSEMBL BioMart. In situations where
more than one STRING record could be mapped to a gene pair, the genes
were considered to interact if at least one of the records fulﬁlled the minimum
required combined score. This resulted in a network composed of 13 104
vertices (genes) and 330 523 edges (interactions).

2.2 Co-clustering

As mentioned earlier, the task of analyzing expression data in the context of
an interaction network has often been framed as an optimization problem
(Dittrich et a1., 2008; Ideker et a1., 2002; Nacu et a1., 2007; Sohler
et 611., 2004). Roughly speaking, this means deﬁning a scoring function on
subnetworks, and then using a search algorithm to look for high scoring,
connected regions. Although a similar approach is possible for RNAi data,
such a formulation of the problem is probably not optimal. At the very least,
it should not be the only one investigated. For one thing, simply searching for
high scoring, connected subnetworks, where the score is based only on the
individual data values of the genes included in a subgraph, would all too often
return regions that are, although connected, not functionally coherent. This
is especially a problem when using interaction networks that have a small
world property, which is the case for many biological networks (at least in
an approximate sense). Although it is possible to ameliorate this problem
in the case of expression data by including measures of coexpression in the
scoring function (Guo et a1., 2007; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007), a similar
concept unfortunately does not exist in RNAi datasets. As such, functional
coherency needs to be enforced through some other means.

As an alternative (or complement) to viewing the joint interpretation task
as an optimization problem, we propose to frame it as one of clustering. The
general idea of our approach is to ‘cocluster’ by simultaneously considering
the two types of data, such that genes which are both near each other in
the interaction network and at the same time showing strong links to the
phenotype of interest (i.e. the RNAi data) tend to be clustered together.

We represented an interaction network as an undirected graph G: (V, E),
where the set of vertices V correspond to genes, and the set of edges E
to interactions. Given an edge em which connects two vertices 11 and v, a
weight, which we view as a distance, was assigned to the edge in such a
manner that it is smaller the stronger the 11 and v are linked to the phenotype
(i.e. the stronger the data values of 11 and v in the RNAi screen, the shorter the
edge connecting them, if it exists). Speciﬁcally, if pu and pv are the P—values
in the RNAi screen of the genes 11 and v, respectively, then we can view

hu,v=(1_pu)(1_pv) (1)

as a measure of the ‘probability’ that both genes 11 and v are relevant to the
phenotype of interest. Following Equation (1), we calculate the edge weight
w(eu,v) as the probability of observing 11M or higher. Formally,

w(e11,v)=P(h11,vS(I_X)(1_Y)) (2)

where X and Y are independent random variables with a standard uniform
probability distribution. The right—hand side of Equation (2) can be

expressed as
l—hum h
f (1 —  dx
0 1 —X

which can then be simpliﬁed to
1+hw . (1n (11W) — 1) (3)

Note that w(eu,v), which is visualized in Figure 1, can be viewed as a P—value
for how high 11W is. Roughly speaking, the more signiﬁcant pu and pv are,
the smaller w(e,,,v) becomes.

Equation (3) was derived with the assumption that the P—values associated
with the two vertices linked by an edge are independent. This, however, is not
always true in actual biological data. Indeed, it is very reasonable to expect
related genes, for example those that belong to the same protein complex,
to induce similar phenotypes on the virus (if indeed they do induce one).
Nevertheless, this does not hurt the intended purpose of the edgeweight,
which is simply to bring two genes closer to each other in the network if
they both have strong data values (i.e. they both induce strong phenotypes).

With weights assigned to all the edges of the interaction network, we
then construct the WI >< |V| distance matrix M, where mid- is the length of
the shortest path from vertex i to j. We use the well—known Floyd—Warshall
algorithm to solve the all—pairs—shortest path problem. Using M as input,
we then cluster the genes using a version of average linkage clustering.

Fig. 1. Edge weights. The surface corresponds to the weight (distance)
assigned to an edge as a function of the P—values of the two vertices that it
connects.

Brieﬂy, the method starts by treating the set of vertices (genes) as singleton
clusters, and then successively joins clusters with the smallest average
pairwise distance. The result of the clustering procedure is a binary tree
(or dendogram), wherein each leaf corresponds to a gene (vertex), and each
internal node to a cluster consisting of all the genes (leaves) that descend
from it.

The dendogram by itself could already be used for biological hypothesis
generation. Starting from seed nodes, which could be genes of prior interest
or simply genes with the strongest data values in the RNAi screen, one
could gain insight into the mechanism of action of the seed gene by
looking at the clusters that it belongs to. This can be done by exploring
the path in the dendogran which originates from the corresponding leaf, and
then moving progressively upwards. Because of the manner in which the
clustering procedure was conducted, the clusters along this path should give
an impression as to which genes are both associated with a strong screening
value and at the same time near the seed in the interaction network. To aid in
this exploration, we use an additional scoring system to estimate the amount
of signal in the different clusters. One possibility for this purpose is the
subnetwork score used by Ideker et al. (2002) for expression data:

1
ZA = — Z1 (4)
where A is the set of vertices in the subnetwork, k is the size of A and z,- is the
z—score of vertex (gene) 1. However, the problem with Equation (4) is that
it is far too ‘tolerant’; such that search strategies using this scoring function
often return huge subnetworks, even if there is actually no signal in the data
(Dittrich et al., 2008; Rajagopalan and Agarwal, 2005). The reason for this
is that even under the null hypothesis, where z,- are normally distributed,
approximately half of them could still contribute to a positive score.
Because of the shortcomings of Equation (4), we deﬁned an alternative
scoring function, similar to that employed by Dittrich et al. (2008), which
allows the control or estimation of the amount of signal in the clusters.
Speciﬁcally, we calculated the score of a cluster C as

(1‘912)

Sqo (C) = 2108 (IE—:10) (5)
veC T

where 61v is the q—value of vertex v, and 610 e (0, 1.0] is a reference 61—
value parameter. Since the q—value of a test provides a measure of the false
discovery rate (FDR) when that particular test is called signiﬁcant, then the
main numerator rv = (1 —qv) /61v of Equation (5) can be roughly interpreted

as a signal to noise ratio for vertex v. Inspired by a log—odds score, the ﬁnal
contribution of v to Sq0 was calculated by dividing rv by the analogous ratio
for the reference q—value, 610, and then taking the logarithm. This results
in a scoring system wherein only vertices associated with an FDR better
than 610 would be able to contribute positively. Consequently, even though
clusters can contain negative scoring vertices, only those that include genes
that actually have a chance of being signiﬁcant can get a non—negative Sqo.
We calculated q—values using the method of Storey (2002).

In addition to exploring the dendogram by tracing paths from seed nodes
(leaves), an alternative strategy for biological hypothesis generation is to
directly extract ‘active regions’ from the network. We do this by scanning
the whole tree, and then creating a super cluster consisting of all clusters that
have a positive score given 610 and larger than a minimum size. In this way,
the parameter 610 controls both the size of, and the amount of signal in, the
resulting subnetwork. Note that if the RNAi data actually has no signal, then
all genes would have a q—value of at least 1.0. This means that no cluster can
have a positive score regardless of 610, and accordingly an empty subnetwork
would be returned (which is the desired behavior). Control of this parameter
is further discussed in the Supplementary Material.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

HCV is a positive sense single—stranded RNA virus that in humans
causes its namesake disease, hepatitis C (Senecal and Morelli, 2007).
About 3% of the world’s population (270—300 million) is chronically
infected with HCV. Of this number, ~30% will develop cirrhosis
(liver scarring) within 20 years of initial infection, a condition that
could then progress to life—threatening complications, including liver
failure and hepatocellular carcinoma. Like all viruses, various stages
in the life cycle of HCV, including entry, uncoating, intracellular
transport, replication, assembly and egress, are dependent on cellular
proteins. We applied our method to a genome—wide screen aimed
at identifying these host factors (Tai et al., 2009). Out of the
approximately 21 000 knockdowns included in the study, we were
able to map 17 821 to ENTREZ records. Of these, 13 104 participate
in at least one interaction in the STRING—derived network. All
subsequent analyses were limited to this subset.

One of the genes with the strongest RNAi data value is COPB 1. It
is a subunit of the COPI complex, which coats vesicles transporting
proteins from the Golgi body back to the rough endoplasmic
reticulum. The early parts of the clustering path originating from the
COPBl leaf going to the dendogram root is visualized in Figure 2. In
addition to COPB 1, several other COPI subunits showed very strong
RNAi data values. These were incrementally clustered together with
the seed, culminating in cluster A (Fig. 2), which includes ﬁve of
the seven COPI subunits and the genes ARFl and ARCNl. Given
that the latter two genes are also involved in vesicular trafﬁcking, it
is thus very likely that the strong phenotype induced by knockdown
of COPBl has indeed something to do with its role in the COPI
complex. Note that although the subsequent additions to cluster A
decreased the score (see clusters B and C), this does not mean that the
added genes are likely to be noise, since a very stringent reference
61—value was used (610 =0.02). Indeed, all the genes in cluster C are
associated with a 61 < 0.5. A comparison between using Equations
(4) and (5) to score the clusters is made in Supplementary Figure S3.

In addition to manual exploration, the dendogram can also be
used for biological hypothesis generation by directly extracting
from the network regions with high activity and coherence. In the
case of HCV, we do this by merging all positve—scoring clusters
(for 610 =0.02) with at least four vertices. The resulting subnetwork

is visualized in Figure 3. Note that it includes the earlier described
coatomer complex. Other prominent functions and/or complexes
include eukaryotic translation initiation, ribosome, RNA export,
inositol metabolism, rRNA and ESCRT—III. A detailed list of the
genes is provided as Supplementary Material.
Chromatin—modifying protein 2A (CHMP2A) was one of the
strongest hits in the original screen (Tai et al., 2009). Although the
gene was further validated by deconvolution of the corresponding
siRNA pool, its relevance to HCV replication was not explored
beyond noting that the gene has been linked to membrane trafﬁcking.
Here, the clustering (Fig. 3) gives some insights on a probable
mechanism as to how CHMP2A could facilitate HCV infection.
Note that the gene is clustered together with VPS4A, VPS24
and CHMP4B, all of which are associated with multivesicular
bodies (MVB s). These play central roles in the endosomal pathway,
which is responsible for internalizing molecules from the plasma
membrane and sorting them for degradation or recycling back to
the cell surface. In particular, CHMP2A, CHMP4B and VPS24
(also called CHMP3) are components of the ESCRT—III complex,
which, together with other multiprotein complexes (0, I and II),
act to incorporate ubiquitinated target proteins into MVBs. On the
other hand, VPS4A catalyzes the dissociation of membrane—bound
ESCRT—III assemblies, and redistributes them to the cytoplasm for
further rounds of MVB sorting. Given that many enveloped viruses
exploit this pathway in order to acquire a membrane and facilitate
assembly and release, including human immunodeﬁciency virus
type—1 (Garrus et al., 2001), Ebola virus (Martin—Serrano et al.,
2001), hepatitis B virus (Lambert et al., 2007) and herpes simplex
virus 1 (Crump et al., 2007), it is not difﬁcult to imagine that the
same is also true for HCV. Indeed, a very recent study concluded

this to be the case (Corless etal., 2010). In it, they showed that viral
particle production is greatly reduced upon transfection of plasmids
expressing various dominant negative forms of VPS4 and ESCRT—III
components.

Edge weights, as calculated according to Equation (3), rely on
the individual P—values of the adjacent vertices. However, it is not
always possible to obtain such statistical measures of signiﬁcance
(i.e. P—values), particularly if the data are unusually distributed.
Accordingly, we also developed a non—parametric version of our
method that is able to deal with such cases. This is described and
compared to the basic approach in the Supplementary Material.

To illustrate the difference between our method, which aims at
greater functional coherency in the identiﬁed active subnetworks,
and one that uses an optimization formulation, we also applied the
algorithm of Dittrich et a1. (2008) (as implemented in the BioNet
R package) to the HCV data. The comparison is summarized in
Figure 4. Note that for similarly sized subnetworks, the ones returned
by our method (labelled as ‘COCLUST — ave—linkage’ in the ﬁgure)
tend to have more connections between the vertices (i.e. the genes
tend to have more interactions between them; see graph of Fig. 4A
and C). However, this increase in functional coherency was achieved
at the cost of an increase in the overall 61—value level associated with
the genes (Fig. 4B). Finer control of this trade—off is one of the
directions that we intend to pursue in subsequent studies.

In addition to average—linkage, we also tried using a single—linkage
criterion for the clustering aspect of our method when applied to the
HCV data. The results are again summarized in Figure 4. Using
this variant, the properties of the subnetworks that we identiﬁed,
speciﬁcally with respect to connectivity and the mean associated 61—
value of the genes, were more similar to those of comparably sized
subnetworks found by the optimization approach BioNet. This is
because in contrast to average—linkage, where merge steps depend
on the average distance between all pairs of genes from two clusters,
single—linkage only considers the two genes that are closest to each
other. That is, single—linkage, similar to BioNet (which only requires
subnetworks to be connected), does not take group effects into
account. In fact, for small network sizes (11 < 100), single—linkage co—
clustering even returned subnetworks with a better overall 61—value
level than the optimization approach (Fig. 4A). This latter behavior
is due to the fact that, in contrast to BioNet, we do not require active
regions to be fully connected; rather, we allow them to be composed
of separate clusters or modules.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

We presented a method for the contextual interpretation of RNAi—
based functional screening data using interaction networks. Rather
than posing the task as a maximal connected sub graph problem, as is
often done with expression data, we framed it as one of clustering. In
particular, we employed a co—clustering strategy where genes that are
both near each other in the interaction network and at the same time
show strong links to the phenotype of interest tend to be clustered
together. The result of our method is a dendogram that can be used
for biological hypothesis generation in two ways: (i) by manually
exploring the clustering from seed genes of a priori interest; or (ii)
by directly extracting ‘active subnetworks’. We demonstrated our
approach by applying it to a genome—wide screen for host factors
of the human pathogen, hepatitis C virus. In addition to recovering
known cellular modules relevant to HCV infection, our analysis

Fig. 3. Host factors of hepatitis C virus. A global view of the human proteins affecting HCV replication was formed by merging all positve—scoring clusters
(for go 2 0.02) with at least four vertices (fc 2 fold change). In addition to the coatomer complex that was described earlier, other prominent functions and/or
complexes in the subnetwork include eukaryotic translation initiation, ribosome, RNA export, inositol metabolism, rRNA and ESCRT—III.

allowed us to identify new potential candidates, and formulate
biological hypotheses regarding possible roles and mechanisms for
a number of them.

Our clustering approach enforces a level of functional coherency
in the resulting subnetworks by considering ‘group effects’ at
each merge step. As opposed to the more traditional optimization
strategy usually employed for expression data, where subnetworks
only need to be connected, the use of an average linkage score
means that clusters would tend to comprise more of genes that
are more closely connected to each other. In addition to promoting
functional coherency, this also affords our method the possibility of
highlighting groups of related genes that, although individually may
only be moderately associated with the phenotype of interest, could
collectively be more important than genes with more obvious data
values. This feature is especially important for RNAi datasets since
false negatives systematically arise from several properties of the
experimental system. For example, even if a gene were genuinely
linked to the phenotype of interest, knocking it down would not
necessarily result in an observable effect if there is another gene that
could also perform the respective function. Even if the alternative

can only partially compensate for the loss, this could still be enough
to pull down the signal to noise levels. Another potential source of
false negatives is the efﬁcacy of the RNAi reagents themselves. In
most large-scale screens, there is typically no information on the
extent to which knockdown of a targeted protein has been achieved.
In fact, it is often not even clear whether the target has been perturbed
at all, or, potentially even more problematic, whether the RNAi
reagent cross-reacted with unintended targets, thus causing the so-
called ‘off—target effects’. Although the latter possibility actually
causes false positives instead of false negatives, it still underscores
the need for functional coherency in the results in order to improve
conﬁdence.

One of the future improvements that we intend to pursue is the
formulation of alternative edge weight functions [see Equation (3)].
This will have an inﬂuence on the method’s trade-off between
the individual signiﬁcance of the genes in the clusters and their
functional coherency. In particular, we plan to investigate the use
of a weighted sum of logistic curves, with shape parameters that
could be used to control the aforementioned trade-off in a continuous
manner. Other aspects that we also plan to investigate include the

from the dendogram, the use of alternative clustering algorithms,
and extending our method to be applicable to high—dimensional
RNAi screens (i.e. screens that simultaneously monitor more than
one phenotype). We will be applying the method to three new
RNAi—based screens for viral host factors that we are currently
analyzing.

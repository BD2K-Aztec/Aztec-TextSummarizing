Abstract

Motivation: Microbial consortia are frequently defined by numerous interactions within the com—
munity that are key to understanding their function. While microbial interactions have been exten—
sively studied experimentally, information regarding them is dispersed in the scientific literature.
As manual collation is an infeasible option, automated data processing tools are needed to make
this information easily accessible.

Results: We present @Mlnter, an automated information extraction system based on Support
Vector Machines to analyze paper abstracts and infer microbial interactions. @Mlnter was trained
and tested on a manually curated gold standard dataset of 735 species interactions and 3917 anno—
tated abstracts, constructed as part of this study. Cross—validation analysis showed that @Mlnter
was able to detect abstracts pertaining to one or more microbial interactions with high specificity
(specificity=95%, AUC=0.97). Despite challenges in identifying specific microbial interactions in
an abstract (interaction level recall 2 95%, precision = 25%), @Mlnter was shown to reduce annota—
tor workload 13—fold compared to alternate approaches. Applying @Mlnter to 175 bacterial species
abundant on human skin, we identified a network of 357 literature—reported microbial interactions,
demonstrating its utility for the study of microbial communities.

1 Introduction

In its natural state, microbial life often does not form a homogenous
population, but is instead present as heterogeneous communities
composed of distinct species i.e. a Microbiome. Microbiomes are
virtually ubiquitous amongst telluric environments; soil, banknotes
and even macroscopic organisms are all environmental niches that
play host to one or more microbial communities (Donaldson et 61].,
2015; Jalali et 61]., 2015; Zeglin et 61]., 2015).

In recent years, microbial consortia resident in the human body
have become a topic of particular interest. The human microbiome
is now known to be intricately linked to overall human health

(Guinane and Cotter, 2013). Microbiome dysfunction has been
implicated in a number of disease conditions (Morgan et 61]., 2012;
Turnbaugh et 61]., 2006; Weyrich et 61]., 2015), while bacteria in a
‘healthy’ microbiome are known to act in a mutualistic fashion to—
wards their host (Bergonzelli et 61]., 2006; Rossi et 61]., 2011).
Despite this, the ecological structure and functional interconnections
of the human microbiome are still not well understood (Chen et 611.,
2014»

These gaps in our knowledge can be attributed in part to the fun—
damental complexity of microbial communities. Microbiota func—
tions as a system of multiple interdependent actors (Tyler et 61].,

2014). The stability and dynamics of this system are thus not the dir—
ect result of any one organism but instead emerge from the sum total
of the interactions contained within (Buffie et al., 2014; Pepper and
Rosenfeld, 2012). Understanding the functional behavior of a micro—
biome thus requires information on not only the composition of the
microbiome, but also how its individual components interact (Stein
et al., 2013).

Data from large—scale studies of the human microbiome provide
an avenue for a data—driven understanding of interactions within a
community. These studies typically use high—throughput sequencing
to quantify individual abundances within a microbial community.
These abundances can then be used by a number of statistical tech—
niques to predict microbial interactions (Ban et al., 2015; Friedman
and Alm, 2012). However, the general performance of such methods
can be difficult to assess in the absence of a ‘gold standard’ database
of experimentally validated interactions.

Microbial interactions have long been experimentally investi-
gated. Coculture experiments and growth assays allow for identifi-
cation of both direction and strength of bacterial interactions
(Trosvik et al., 2010). However, current information describing mi-
crobial interactions is spread across a large, constantly increasing set
of papers; PubMed alone references upwards of 24 million articles
at the time of writing, of which almost two million refer to bacteria.
Consolidation of literature curated data into a single gold—standard
database would be a valuable resource for refining microbial inter-
action models. However, the sheer quantity of information makes
this an imposing proposition with brute—force manual collation
being infeasible.

Microbial interactions are not the first field to experience this
challenge. The implementation of automated systems for informa—
tion extraction has been frequently used to mine large datasets such
as the unstructured text compendiums of scientific literature. Text-
mining techniques have shown promising results in biomedical in—
formation extraction tasks involving Protein—Protein Interactions
(PPIs) (Donaldson et al., 2003), disease—drug/drug—drug interactions
(Chen et al., 2008; Tari et al., 2010) and literature annotation (Liu
et al., 2015) among others. For example, the database preBIND aug—
mented traditional curation methods with a PPI identification sys—
tem. By pre-filtering of the literature to remove irrelevant data, they
achieved an estimated 60% reduction in annotation time
(Donaldson et al., 2003).

For microbial interactions, Freilich et al. (2010) performed the
pioneering, and at the time of writing, only automated analysis of
the literature surrounding microbial interactions. They analyzed the
co—occurrence of bacterial species in the literature through a statis—
tical testing approach, organizing hits into a co—occurrence network.
However, other than this study, text—mining has not been applied
for the identification of microbial interactions. In particular, the ap—
plication of machine learning approaches has not been explored and
is also not straightforward, as evidence for a microbial interaction
can be embedded in a hard to parse fashion in paper abstracts. For
example, a paper abstract could describe the production of a specific
molecule M by species A in the first part of the abstract, while the
second part highlights the reduction in growth of species B in the
presence of M, without explicitly stating that A can inhibit the
growth of B. While this is a simplified example, in practice, even
more complex textual and logical analysis may be needed to mine
this information. A more tractable approach may be to use combin—
ations of keywords to first identify abstracts reporting microbial
interactions as proposed here. An additional challenge for machine
learning approaches is the absence of sufficiently large datasets for
model training.

Here, we describe @Mlnter (acronym for Automated Text-min-
ing of Microbial Interactions), a machine—learning—based text—min—
ing system for automated identification and extraction of microbial
interaction data. @Mlnter complements manual annotation and cur—
ation through the identification of potentially informative texts, to
accelerate the pace of data curation. The @Mlnter system comprises
two core components, a Bioconductor—based crawler for the acquisi—
tion of article data and a Support—Vector Machine (SVM)—based
classifier for the identification of abstracts containing interaction in-
formation. For comparison, we also evaluated the performance of
the co—occurrence method devised by Freilich et al., as well as a rudi—
mentary pattern—based classifier available as part of @MInter.
@MInter’s SVM—based approach was found to classify abstracts
containing one or more microbial interactions with a specificity of
95% and notably reduce annotator workload for identifying specific
microbial interactions (13—fold compared to competing approaches).

In addition, we present a large annotated dataset for microbial
interactions consisting of 3917 abstracts (annotated to describe the
presence and type of the interaction), as well as a collated set of 735
known species interactions, that can serve as a resource for the de—
velopment of new interaction mining algorithms. In addition, as a
proof—of—concept, @Mlnter was employed to systematically con—
struct a curated database of interactions between 175 bacterial spe—
cies commonly found on human skin, highlighting the feasibility of
large—scale use and providing a resource for ongoing studies of the

human microbiome.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Creation of a training dataset for @Mlnter

2.1.1 Acquisition of paper abstracts

Supervised classifiers such as the SVM used in the @Mlnter system
require an annotated set for training and testing purposes. To facili—
tate this, we first created an annotated corpus of PubMed abstracts.
To acquire raw abstract data, 1747 query species associated with
the human gastrointestinal tract were initially selected as reported in
MEDUSA data (Karlsson et al., 2014). Due to practicality concerns,
species with low abundance (mean read count <50) were discarded,
resulting in a total of 482 species. Queries following the pattern
‘Species_1 AND Species_2’ were then derived from all possible spe—
cies pairs. These were queried against the PubMed database to pro—
duce a collection of all papers containing both species names. The
PubMed ID, abstract text and title of each paper were retained and
organized into their respective interaction pairs for later analysis.
Only pairs possessing at least one article were retained. For the ini—
tial dataset, information for 11 546 interaction pairs was collected
and sampled from.

2.1.2 Construction of a core dataset

Lactobacillus acidopbilus is a probiotic bacterium well known for
its antagonistic interactions with multiple other bacteria such as
Escherichia coli. As such, the L. acidopbilus—E. coli query pair was
selected as a core dataset for the training of all SVMs. For this data—
set, all abstracts pertaining to the pair (11 = 350) were manually clas—
sified as follows (Supplementary File S1):

1. No suggested interaction (negatives)
2. Interaction between other species (positives)
3. Interaction between Lacidopbilus and E.coli (positives)

@MInter: automated text-mining of microbial interactions

 

2.1.3 Construction of an extended dataset

To construct an extended dataset for training and evaluation of clas—
sifiers, a subset of 1000 species pairs (735 after excluding ambigu—
ous species names) was randomly sampled from the abstract dataset
and annotated on two levels.

First, species level annotation considered whether any of the ab—
stracts containing a species pair described a true interaction. To do
this, abstracts were manually scanned by a single annotator
(L.K.M.K.) for information pertaining to interaction between spe—
cies pairs in the list. Species pairs where the first 200 abstracts con—
taining both species did not report an interaction were considered to
be not interacting (to reduce annotator load). Overall, 62 interacting
pairs were identified (out of 735) out of which 56 were inhibitory
and only 6 were non—inhibitory (Supplementary File S2).

Second, abstract level annotation identified abstracts that de—
scribe a true interaction. Here, brute force random sampling from
all abstracts produced a heavily unbalanced set (3 positives; 197
negatives) that is not well suited for the training of a supervised clas—
sifier. To address this, an SVM trained on the core dataset (see
Section 2.2) was applied to abstracts from the species level annota—
tion to identify and enrich for true positives. Putative positives from
the core dataset trained SVM were then manually annotated. By
comparing to known interaction pairs from the species level annota—
tion, false—negative species pairs reported by the core SVM were
identified, i.e. species pairs that are known to be interacting but
with no abstracts identified by the SVM. All abstracts for such pairs
were further manually annotated. In total, 3917 (350 core, 3567 ex—
tended) individual abstracts (241 positives and 3676 negatives) were
annotated at this level (Supplementary Files S1 and S3). Thus the ab—
stract level annotation only includes abstracts from interacting spe—
cies pairs. Because of the use of a SVM classifier to aid the
generation of the dataset, it is expected to be biased and distinct
from a random sampling of abstracts. However, the exclusion of ab—
stracts from true—negative species pairs from the extended abstract
dataset (likely to be easy to classify), and the inclusion of all false-
positive and false—negative abstracts from the core SVM is likely to
bias the training dataset to harder test cases for SVM training.
Results from annotation of interactions between skin bacteria (see
Section 3.4) further support the notion that the training datasets for
the SVM were more challenging than real datasets.

2.2 Training ofthe @Mlnter classifier

A SVM is a supervised machine learning model based upon the prin-
ciple of structural risk minimization (Joachims, 1998). SVMs are
capable of learning patterns from text datasets, and have seen exten—
sive use in a number of data categorization tasks (Joachims, 2001;
Tong and Koller, 2001).

@MInter’s classifier is based on the SVM module in the skLearn
package (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Training was done on the core
dataset along with 5—fold cross—validation based on the extended
dataset i.e. core dataset and four—fifths of extended dataset were
used to train and one—fifth of the extended dataset was used to test.
Abstracts were converted to a feature vector (count for each word as
a feature) using the inbuilt skLearn vectorizer. Feature vectors were
sparse as expected (0.4% non—zero elements), with an average ab—
stract containing 183 words and feature space dimensionality of 25
783. Feature values were weighted using Term Frequency—Inverse
Document Frequency (TF—IDF), a heuristic measure of term rele—
vance commonly used in text analysis (Ramos et al., 2003). Unlike
raw term frequency counts, TF—IDF weighs document term frequen—
cies against its frequency across the entire corpus, downscaling the

relevance of frequently occurring terms. The implementation of
TF-IDF used in this study is as follows:

TF — IDF(t, d, D) = tf(t, d) x (IDF(t, D) + 1),

where tf(t, d) : ftad, the frequency of term t in document(s) d and,
IDF(t, D) : ln(N/ft7D), with N being the total number of documents
in corpus D.

A linear kernel was chosen for the SVM. Radial basis function
kernels were also evaluated, but did not provide significant perform-
ance improvement. The C parameter was kept at default value
(C = 1; lower misclassification penalty) as optimizing it with a grid
search and cross—validation did not result in significant performance
improvements and we wished to conserve our limited training set.
To account for class imbalance in the dataset, automated class
weighting was used (Pedregosa et al., 2011). Note that the SVM
classifier in @Mlnter can only identify abstracts that are likely to re—
port a microbial interaction. This is based on the ability of the SVM
to identify combinations of features/terms that are more enriched in
abstracts reporting interactions. Once an abstract is identified, all
pairs of species reported in it then need to be considered as candi—
date microbial interactions, as abstracts frequently report multiple
interactions.

2.3 An alternate pattern—based method in @Mlnter

A simple pattern—based system for interaction identification was im—
plemented to complement and compare with the machine-learning
approach used in @MInter. Source data consisted of abstracts from
the core dataset, as well as the extended dataset. Permutations of
bacterial names, as well as interaction—describing keywords were
manually derived from the source data for later use as patterns. Due
to the limited number of abstracts containing non-inhibitory inter-
actions in the annotated dataset, keywords were restricted to those
suggesting inhibitory interactions. Keywords included words such as
‘inhibit’, ‘bacteriocin’ and ‘lysed’. To account for inflective vari—
ations in individual words, abstracts and keywords were stemmed
using the Snowball algorithm (Porter, 2001). Derived rules were im—
plemented using patterns of regular expression, where terms were
species names from the evaluated bacterial pair, as well as selected
keywords. The terms were then joined with the ‘3‘“ ’ token (allowing
for arbitrary intervening matches) to give the final pattern expres—
sions. A sample pattern, ‘Species_1 inhibits Species_2’ would thus
convert to the regex ‘Species_1."'inhibit.’*Species_2’. A full list of
patterns used can be found in Supplementary File S4.

2.4 Reimplementation of a co—occurrence—based
approach

The co—occurrence—based approach proposed by Freilich et al.
(2010), and a straightforward extension, were implemented for
comparison with @MInter. Specifically, for each species pair in the
extended dataset, three queries were performed on PubMed to com—
pute the number of papers containing each species (species name as
query term), and the number containing both species (both species
names joined by an ‘AND’ as query term). A straightforward exten—
sion also included the stemmed keywords from a manually curated
term set (Supplementary File S4).

To compute statistical significance for the number of abstracts
for any species pair (or pair and term), a Fisher’s exact test was per—
formed with a contingency table containing four categories: ab—
stracts containing solely species A, abstracts containing solely
species B, abstracts containing neither species A or B and abstracts
containing both A and B. A Bonferroni corrected P—value threshold

of 0.01 was used to identify overrepresented and thus potentially
interacting species pairs.

2.5 Evaluation metrics

Due to the presence of a skewed evaluation dataset (in terms of
number of positives and negatives) accuracy—based measures were
not used and instead, we report primarily the recall, specificity and
precision of the methods, as well as the papers—per—hit (PPH) metric
described below. All evaluations were done based on a held out test
set in a cross—validation framework using the manually curated ex—
tended dataset.

2.5.1 Recall, specificity and precision
Given a set of classified entries, recall, specificity and precision are
defined as follows:

Recall : TP/(TP —l— FN)
Specificity : TN/ (TN —l— FP)
Precision : TP/(TP —l— FP)

where TP, TN, FP and FN are true positives, true negatives, false
positives and false negatives, respectively.

2.5.2 Papers-per—lait

In order to capture the value of the various approaches in reducing
annotator effort, we computed PPH as an additional metric.
Specifically, PPH is computed as the average number of abstracts re—
ported by a method per true—positive interaction identified. For the
co—occurrence—based approaches, all abstracts from false—positive
and true—positive interaction pairs were considered as being
reported.

2.6 Analysis of skin microbiome data

Skin metagenomic profiles from Oh et al. (2014) (291 samples in
total) were used to infer interacting species based on correlations in
abundances (Spearman correlation). In addition, CCREPE (Bielski
and Weingart, 2014) was used to correct for the compositional ef—
fect (Faust et al., 2012) arising from working with relative abun-
dance profiles. Correlations with P—value less than 0.01 were
compared with literature—curated interactions from @Mlnter ana—
lysis (see Section 3.4).

2.7 Software

@Mlnter and associated programs were written entirely in the
Python 3 programming language. Source code is available at https://
github.com/CSB5/atminter under the MIT license.

3 Results
3.1 @Mlnter has high specificity at the abstract level

The performance of @Mlnter was first evaluated at the level of ab—
stracts (using the abstract level annotation). Cross—validation—based
analysis indicated an ‘area under curve of receiver operating charac—
teristic’ (AUC—ROC) of 0.97 for the SVM method (Fig. 1) . At a con—
fidence threshold of 0.5, this provided 82% recall, 95% specificity
and 49% precision. In comparison, the alternate ‘pattern scanner’
approach had lower recall (19%) with similar specificity (96%) and
precision (44%). As multiple abstracts can potentially provide infor—
mation about the same interaction pair, low recall at the abstract
level could be compensated for at the species level. However, this

may not be the case if recall is too low. Since the primary purpose of
@Mlnter was to serve as a first—pass filter to enrich for abstracts that
pertain to microbial interactions, high recall at the species level was
set as the primary design goal (see Section 3.2). For applications
where higher precision may be required, using a larger confidence
value threshold for the SVM classifier might be more appropriate
(e.g. threshold of 0.9 provided 72% precision, 16% recall and
99.5% specificity).

3.2 @Mlnter improves performance at the species level
We next evaluated @MInter’s SVM and pattern scanner approach at
the species level and compared them to the Fisher’s exact test used in
Freilich et al. (as well as a modified version with inhibition terms:
‘Fisher w/inhibition’). Note that the approaches based on statistical
testing cannot be applied at the abstract level.

To measure enrichment over random selection, the ratio of recall
to proportion of species pairs returned as true positives was com—
puted and plotted for 5—fold cross—validation analysis (Fig. 2). Both
the SVM and pattern scanner approaches provided an improvement
(>2—fold) over random sampling where the ratio is expected to be 1.
The pattern scanner approach was found to have better enrichment
due to its high specificity (Table 1). In contrast, the approach pro—
posed in Freilich et al. (Naive Fisher) provided a more modest im—
provement that was further boosted by the inclusion of inhibition
terms as proposed here.

Species—level results for @Mlnter and other methods are further
summarized in Table 1. As expected, compared to the abstract level
analysis, @MInter’s SVM predictions have high recall at 95% (ver—
sus 82% at abstract level). This allows sensitive mining of abstracts,
albeit at the expense of modest specificity (78%). Overall,
@MInter’s SVM performance was found to be a notable improve—
ment compared to Freilich et al., even compared to the improved ap—
proach using inhibition terms (Table 1). The pattern scanner
approach on the other hand provided the best specificity (92%) but
with low recall (24%). @MInter’s species—level precision was found
to be low despite being the best across all methods. This is partly be—
cause it identifies abstracts containing interactions and reports all
pairs of species names in such abstracts. A more refined approach

3.3 Impact on annotator workload using @Mlnter

The primary utility of an information extraction system such as
@Mlnter is the reduction of annotator workload, in this case when
identifying microbial interactions from paper abstracts. As scientific
abstracts can be complex to parse and often contain specialized vo—
cabulary, it is unlikely that human intervention can be completely
eliminated. We used the notion of PPH to measure the utility of vari—
ous approaches from an annotator’s perspective (see Section 2.5.2).
Overall, both the SVM and pattern scanner approach in @MInter
allow annotators to identify a reported microbial interaction by
reading 3 6 abstracts on average (Table 2). This is a significant re-
duction compared to the statistical approach in Freilich et al. (>15—
fold) as well as a naive approach involving the annotation of all ab—
stracts (AP; 13—fold). Notably, due to lower recall, the statistical
approaches place a greater burden on the annotator than even a
naive approach (Table 2). The SVM—based approach was chosen as
the default option in @MInter, due to its high species level recall
(95 %) compared to the pattern scanner approach.

3.4 Application of @Mlnter for large—scale annotation
Training of the @Mlnter SVM classifier was found to be quite effi—
cient taking <5 min overall. Classification of abstracts can then be
performed at the rate of >90 abstracts/s. Applying the @Mlnter
SVM classifier to the PubMed database (>25 million abstracts)
would, therefore, require slightly more than 3 days on a single com—
pute core. The principal bottleneck for applying @Mlnter to the
PubMed database is thus in the acquisition and storage of abstracts
for further processing.

To investigate the feasibility of applying @Mlnter for large—scale
annotation, we explored its use for constructing a microbial inter-
action database focused on skin bacteria. Specifically, we selected a
set of 175 bacterial species known to be relatively abundant on
human skin (Supplementary File S5) (Oh et al., 2014). The PubMed
database was then queried with @Mlnter for abstracts containing all
pairs of species from this list. In total, 29 948 abstracts were ob—
tained of which 3196 were marked as containing interactions by the
@Mlnter SVM. Disjoint subsets of these were than manually anno—
tated by a team of 11 annotators to obtain an interaction network
involving >100 species and 35 7 literature—reported microbial inter-
actions (Supplementary File S6). Reassuringly, observed annotator
workload was lower than originally estimated in our test datasets
(PPH = 3.3 ).

The curated network of interactions between bacteria commonly
found on skin (Supplementary File S7; a subset of Supplementary
File S6 as abstracts can contain other species interactions as well)
highlighted several relevant interactions including the inhibition
of Staphylococcus aureus (an important skin pathogen) by
several Lactohacillus and Biﬂdohacterium species (known pro—
biotics; Fig. 3). Interestingly, multiple Streptococcus species were
also observed to exert inhibitory inﬂuence over S. aureus. To evalu—
ate overlap with in vivo data, correlation analysis was used to iden—
tify bacterial interactions from skin microbiome data (see Section 2.
6). From the significant edge overlap between the two networks
(Fisher’s exact test P—value:0.00038), we obtained a high confi—
dence sub—network that combines in vivo as well as in vitro
evidence, and describes interactions involving two important
skin pathogens (S. aureus and Propionihacterium acnes) (Fig. 4).
Furthermore, the network provides information on the directionality
of interactions (manually curated from abstracts) enabling the mod—
eling of this core interaction network.

4. Discussion and conclusion

Interactions reported in the scientific literature are likely to have a
culturability and ‘interest’ bias. In addition, this information can be
sparse as most interactions have likely not been tested or have been
tested under limited in vitro conditions. On the other hand,
approaches that look for correlations in microbiome sequencing
profiles are expected to be less biased and provide an in vivo per—
spective (Bielski and Weingart, 2014). Such predictive methods can,

however, be inﬂuenced by many sources of noise (sparse profiles,
transitive interactions, etc.) that reduce their specificity and sensitiv—
ity. Collections of in vitro validated interactions curated from the lit—
erature can thus play a complementary role, facilitating the
evaluation of interaction prediction algorithms and enabling a better
understanding of microbial interaction networks.

The concept of microbial interactions is complex as it is context
dependent and not restricted to two entities. The analysis in this
manuscript was restricted to binary interactions, and interactions
were collated at the species level as this is typically the taxonomic
level for descriptions in abstracts. The text mining approach used in
@Mlnter is however agnostic to the taxonomic level of analysis or
mode of interaction and with appropriate training could be used to
e.g. mine ternary interactions at the strain level.

@Mlnter improves significantly over existing approaches for
text-mining of microbial interactions and it enables the large scale
curation of interaction information. However, @Mlnter does not
identify the mode/directionality of interactions or eliminate the need
for manual curation. While further work in developing methods

with higher precision (potentially by analyzing full manuscripts)
could reduce manual effort, based on our own experience with the
complexity of information in abstracts, we believe that it is unlikely
that human input can be eliminated completely. We hope that the
availability of curated datasets generated and used here would en—
able the further development of supervised machine learning
approaches for this problem.

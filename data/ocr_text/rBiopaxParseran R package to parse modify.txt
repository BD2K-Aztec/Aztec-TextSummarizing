ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological pathway data, stored in structured databases,
is a useful source of knowledge for a wide range of bioinformatics
algorithms and tools. The Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) lan-
guage has been established as a standard to store and annotate path-
way information. However, use of these data within statistical analyses
can be tedious. On the other hand, the statistical computing environ-
ment R has become the standard for bioinformatics analysis of
large-scale genomics data. With this package, we hope to enable R
users to work with BioPAX data and make use of the always increas-
ing amount of biological pathway knowledge within data analysis
methods.

Results: rBiopaxParser is a software package that provides a com-
prehensive set of functions for parsing, viewing and modifying BioPAX
pathway data within R. These functions enable the user to access and
modify specific parts of the BioPAX model. Furthermore, it allows to
generate and layout regulatory graphs of controlling interactions and
to visualize BioPAX pathways.

Availability: rBiopaxParser is an open-source R package and has
been submitted to Bioconductor.

1 INTRODUCTION

The past years have seen an enormous increase in biological
knowledge about cellular signalling and regulatory pathways,
which is stored in numerous databases (Bader et al., 2006).
However, the fragmentation of the available pathway data led
to the need for a standardized language to ease the knowledge
exchange between scientists. The Biological Pathway Exchange
(BioPAX) language is an ontology that models biological path-
way concepts and their relationships (Demir et al., 2010).
Implemented in the Web Ontology Language (OWL), an
RDF/XML—based format, it allows the user to encode pathway
knowledge in a well-documented and standardized way.

The integration of biological knowledge stored in these data-
bases into high level analysis methods for genomics experiments

is a fundamental issue. Bioinformaticians can integrate pathway
knowledge, collected and curated by the scientiﬁc community,
into statistical analysis as previous knowledge. Examples for
methods for high-level data analysis that require previous path-
way knowledge are Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (BeiBbarth,
2006; Geistlinger et al., 2011), specialized classiﬁcation algo-
rithms for personalized medicine (Johannes et al., 2010) or
network reconstruction algorithms (Bender et al., 2011;
F rohlich et al., 2009). Many of these algorithms are implemented
using the R Project for Statistical Computing. Although the
packages N CIgraph, KEGGgraph and graphite on
Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004; Zhang and Wiemann,
2009) offer exports of signalling networks from speciﬁc data-
bases, no packages exist that allow the user to conveniently
work with BioPAX data in R.

We created the R package rBiopaxParser to ease use and in-
tegration of pathway data in the BioPAX format within R.
Furthermore, the use of R scripts allows reproducible handling
and manipulation of pathway data as well as the integration of
these data into high-level statistical analysis routines.

2 BIOPAX

The BioPAX ontology includes classes for the annotation of
molecules, molecular interactions and pathways. The language
deﬁnition as well as further information, manuals, tools and
examples can be found at http://www.biopax.org. A number of
online databases provide users with a data export in the BioPAX
format, often free of charge, for example, the National Cancer
Institute (NCI), which offers exports of the popular databases
Pathway Interaction Database (Schaefer et al., 2009), Biocarta
(Nishimura, 2001) and Reactome (Croft et al., 2010).

3 FEATURES

The core functions of our package are designed to parse BioPAX
data into R and to export it back to the OWL format.
Many convenience functions help the user to View and
modify speciﬁc parts of the BioPAX model. The rBiopaxParser
currently supports BioPAX Level 2 and 3. More detailed docu-
mentation and examples can be found in the package Vignettes
and manual.

3.1 Downloading and parsing BioPAX

The function downloadBiopaxData has been created to directly
download from Web resources like the NCI databases. The func-
tion readBiopax allows the user to parse arbitrary valid BioPAX
models from the ﬁle system, which are then available within R.

3.2 Internal data structure

After successful parsing, the BioPAX data will be stored as a
dataframe in an R object of class biopax. All instances and their
properties are stored within this dataframe. The inheritance
structure of BioPAX classes and the list of properties available
for each class are also stored within the package. Functions to
check for super- and subclass relationships as well as properties
are available. The biopax object can be passed on to various
functions to modify and extract information. A detailed report
of the internal data representation can be found in the
Supplementary Material.

3.3 Accessing and modifying BioPAX data

The parsed BioPAX data can be easily accessed with the help of
functions like listPathways, listPathwayComponents and
selectInstances. The biopax model can be directly modiﬁed by
functions to add or remove pathways, interactions and
molecules. Furthermore, function mergePathway allows the
user to specify two existing pathways that should be merged
into a single new pathway. Advanced users can access the
BioPAX data directly and edit it to their liking. Finally, the
modiﬁed BioPAX models can be exported in the BioPAX
OWL format using writeBiopax.

3.4 Regulatory graphs and visualization

Encoded BioPAX data can include many biological processes
like translocation, modiﬁcation or transcription. However, it
can be desirable to focus only on regulatory knowledge about
molecules activating or inhibiting each other. The function

pathwaeregulatoryGraph achieves this by generating a graph
from all regulatory interactions within a certain pathway.
Additional functions for lay-outing, merging or intersecting
graphs are also implemented (Fig. 1).

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The rBiopaxParser package takes advantage of the data process-
ing and visualization tools that the R projects provide. Initial
data downloading capabilities for NCI data exports are imple-
mented using the RCurl package, giving the user access to large
amounts of data. The pre-processing and parsing of BioPAX
input ﬁles, as well as the generation of BioPAX output, are
accomplished via the XML package. The regulatory graphs
that can be generated from the internal BioPAX model are gen-
erated and visualized using the graph and Rgraphviz packages
(Carey et al., 2005).

5 CONCLUSION

The rBiopaxParser is a freely available R package that allows the
user to parse, modify and visualize BioPAX models. Regulatory
graphs can be extracted and used for further analyses. With this
R package, we also hope to enable users to apply newly
developed algorithms to the always increasing amount of know-
ledge about biological pathways. By implementing a BioPAX
parser, we offer a tool for R users to ease the task of integrating
existing pathway resources in statistical analyses and encourage
the use of a standardized way to encode pathway knowledge.

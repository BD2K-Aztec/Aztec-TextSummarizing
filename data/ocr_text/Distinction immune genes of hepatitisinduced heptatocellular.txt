ABSTRACT

Motivation: Hepatitis B virus and hepatitis C virus are the two leading
causes resulting in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). It is observed that
hepatitis C virus (HCV) is relatively difficult to induce HCC compared
with hepatitis B virus (HBV). This motivates us to reveal the reasons
behind this from the viewpoint of immune genes.

Results: To distinguish the immune genes with low-level expression in
HBV-induced HCC, but high-level expression in HCV-induced HCC,
the concept of distinction immune gene is proposed. A filter is then
designed to screen these genes. By using gene positive network with
strong correlations between genes, the genes are further filtered to
form the set of key distinction immune genes. The 23 key distinction
immune genes are screened, which are divided into four clusters,
T cells, B cells, immune signalling and major histocompatibility com-
plex. It is evident that the screened genes are important immune
genes, which are activated in HCV-induced HCC, but inactivated in
HBV-induced HCC. In HCV-induced HCC, the structures of HCV
adaptively update, so that they are difficult to be identified by antigens.
Therefore, the clinic advice is either to increase the update speed of
antigens or reduce the update speed of the viruses during the treat-
ment of HCV-induced HCC. Moreover, it is also advised to add T cells
or add the expression levels of T cells to strengthen the ability to kill
cancer cells. In contrast, HBV updates slowly, but the immunity
system in HBV-induced HCC has been damaged seriously. As a
result, the clinic advice is to improve the immune ability of patients
subjected to HBV-induced HCC, such as increasing immunoglobulin,
T cells and B cells and so forth.

1 INTRODUCTION

Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) accounts for 70—85% of pri-
mary liver cancers, ranking it at the ﬁfth position among the
most common malignancies worldwide and in the third position
as a cause of cancer death (Baffy, 2012). HCC is a devastating
tumour, with a mean survival of much less than one year if left
untreated HCC. More than 500 million people worldwide are
persistently infected with the hepatitis B virus (HBV) and/or
hepatitis C virus (HCV), who are at a risk of developing chronic
liver diseases, cirrhosis and even HCC (Rehermann and

Nascimbeni, 2005). Increasingly, experimental evidences suggest
that viruses, such as HBV and HCV, contribute to HCC by
directly modulating pathways that promote the malignant trans-
formation of hepatocytes (Levrero et al., 2012).

HCV infection is one of the major risk factors for HCC.
However, cancer arises in only a subset of patients, which
takes several years to develop. Therefore, the role of HCV in
the aetiology of cancer has remained elusive (Lindenbach,
2012). HCV may activate the immune system, for instance, nat-
ural killer cells are activated by the HCV (Amadei and Urbani,
2010). It is also noticed that HCC may escape adaptive immune
responses (Burke and Cox, 2010). In addition, cirrhosis is a tran-
sition state from normal liver to tumorigenesis in HCV-induced
HCC (Huang et al., 2010).

There is a strong incentive to seek key immune genes and
identify the relationship between these genes and hepatitis-
induced HCC. Motivated by this, a filter is designed to screen
these genes, and experiments are implemented by using the data
from the Stanford database (Chen et al., 2002). According to the
experiment’s results and analyses, clinical recommendations are
finally given for the treatments of HCV-induced HCC and
HBV-induced HCC. Equation-based dynamic network model
Wang et al., 2008) and graph-based gene community network
(Hu and Gao, 2012) are usually used to model gene networks. In
this study, gene community network will be used to describe gene
networks.

2 DATA AND METHODS

2.1 Data

The data come from the Stanford database at http://genome-
www.stanford.edu/hcc/Figures/SupTable3.xls (Chen et al.,
2002). There are 156 samples, and 3180 genes (represented by
3964 cDNAs). Only 136 samples related to hepatitis B or hepa-
titis C are chosen for our research, including four types of sam-
ples, 72 HBV-induced HCC samples, 4 HCV-induced HCC
samples, 54 HBV-infected non-tumour liver samples and 6
HCV-infected non-tumour liver samples.

2.2 Methods

To distinguish the immune genes with low-level expression in
HBV-induced HCC, but with high-level expression in
HCV-induced HCC, the concept of distinction immune gene is
proposed.

Deﬁnition 1. Distinction Immune Gene { DIG )
A gene is called distinction immune gene (DIG) of the hepatitis-
induced HCC provided that the following criteria are satisﬁed:

(i) The average expression level of the gene in the HCV-
induced HCC tissues, simply denoted by HC, is higher
than the average expression level of the gene in the
HCV-infected non-tumour liver tissues, simply called LC.

(ii) The average expression level of the gene in the HBV-
induced HCC samples, simply denoted by HB, is lower
than the average expression level of the gene in HBV-
infected non-tumour liver samples, simply dented by LB.

(iii) The average expression level of the gene in HCV-infected
non-tumour liver tissues is greater than the average expres-
sion level of the gene in HBV-infected non-tumour liver
tissues.

Deﬁnition 1 implies that a DIG should meet the condition
HB < LB < LC < HC. As a result, a three-layer ﬁlter is proposed
as follows:

F:Fl-F2-F3

where

F1: {1, HC—LC>0, (1)

0, Otherwise

1, LC — LB > 0 (2)
0, Otherwise

I, LB—HB>0

0, Otherwise (3)

By using the three-layer ﬁlter, one can obtain the DIGs. To
look at the relation among these genes, gene positive network is
deﬁned as follows.

Deﬁnition 2. Gene positive network

Gene positive network (GPN) is used to describe the positive
relationship between genes. A connection matrix C is used to
store gene community networks, whose element is cij, deﬁned by:

CU:{pij, z>Jand03p,J-<T51 (4)

0,15}

where pi]- is the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient between the i-th
gene and j-th gene, and T is the pre—set threshold value (Gao and
Hu, 2012). For instance, when T: 0.6 or T: 0.8, the obtained
GPN represents a strongly positive network or an extremely
strong positive network.

The higher is the threshold value, the stronger is the obtained
gene positive network, describing the correlations between the
genes. In this research, T: 0.8 is used to screen key DIGs.

To address the importance of the obtained DIGs, the follow-
ing deﬁnition is given.

Deﬁnition 3. Distinction immune gene force
Distinction immune gene force (DIGF) is deﬁned by

DIGF = s1s x GIF (5)

where

s1s = HC — HB (7)

Actually, SIS represents the strength of an individual distinction
immune gene (DIG), whereas GIF stands for the major impacts
of the gene on others genes in the network. As a result, the
product of the SIS and GIF, namely DIGF, can describe the
degree of importance of this gene in the immune system of the
HCC. Greater is the DIGF, more important is the DIG.

3 RESULT

3.1 DIGs

By using the proposed three-layer ﬁlter, we obtain 128 DIGs.
Deleting the duplicate genes, there are 120 DIGs left, which are
shown in Table l.

3.2 Key DIGs and biological functions

In this subsection, we will look at the correlations between the
obtained 128 DIGs. By setting the threshold value as T: 0.8, an
extremely positive-related network is established, shown in
Figure 1. It is noted that there are eight sets of genes
forming extremely strong correlated positive networks, and the
remaining genes have no big impacts on each other. In
addition, the gene network with two nodes is generally composed
of two same genes with different structures. Therefore, we
only emphasize the gene networks with at least three nodes,
leading to the four sets of key DIGs, denoted by A, B, C and
D in Figure l.

The biological functions of the four clusters composed of 23
genes are shown by Table 2.

In the clustering set A, there are two major genes, named
COPB2 and MARVELD2. It is known that the gene COPB2
is related to the signal transduction of G protein (Yan et al.,
2009), and MARVELD2 plays an important role in immune
system signalling (Mariano et al., 2011). Therefore, the cluster
A is about immune signals and immune regulation. In the clus-
tering set B, there are four genes, including T RA@, T RB@,
T RD@ and EPCI, which are all related to the T cells
(Nakahata et al., 2009) with immune functions. As a result, the
cluster B may reﬂect the relationship between the abnormalities
of T cells and liver cancers. In the cluster C, there are genes, such
as ID4, PSMFI, IGKC, CSF2RA, PHC2, SULTIEI, IGHV,
IGL@, T NFSFIO and so on, which form B cell with immune
functions. In the module D, there are three genes, such as MB,
HLA-C and M S T P9, to form the major histocompatibility com-
plex (MHC). The proteins encoded by the MHC genes present
the antigens to T cells (Yan et al., 2009).

3.3 Degree to importance to key DIGs

In this subsection, the degrees of the importance of the four gene
clusters are discussed. Setting the threshold at T: 0.6, the net-
works of the four clusters are shown by Figure 2. It can be seen

that the clusters A, B and C are strongly correlated, and the
cluster D is isolated. It is clear that the cluster B is the centre
of the cluster A—B—C, and the clusters A and C work as the main
forces in this cluster.

By using Deﬁnition 3, we can calculate the average DIGF for
groups A, B, C and D as shown by Table 3. The results are
generally consistent for T: 0.4, 0.6 and 0.8, which
indicates the main force A is much weaker than the main force
C. As a result, the clusters B and C have higher degrees of
importance.

In consequence, we should pay more attention on the immune
genes in the clusters B and C, that is, T cell and B cell genes. The
T cell genes play a central role in the immune system, which is
agreed with the conclusion by (Bowen and Walker, 2005).
Moreover, the B cell genes are a major force in the immune
system.

4 SUGGESTION FOR CLINIC TREATMENT

If a human body was regarded as a computer, the HCV and
HBV would be the viruses, and the immune system would be
the anti-virus software. It is noted that the HCV-induced HCC
and HBV-induced HCC are different, thus we need to classify
them and treat them in different ways.

4.1 Treatment advices to HCV-induced HCC

The immune genes are activated in HCV-induced HCC, which
seem to be in a good position to kill cancer cells. However, HCV
is an RNA virus, whose structures are variable. When an antigen
identiﬁes one of the structures, the HCV may mutate to form
another structure (Rehermann, 2009). Thus, it is challenging to
identify the HCV with varying structures. The human body is
just like a computer installed with anti-virus software, where the

update of viruses is always faster than the update of the software,
eventually leading to the collapse of the computer. As a result, it
is essential either to increase the update speed of antigens or
reduce the update speed of the viruses during the treatment of
HCV-induced HCC.

Moreover, we have found that the T cells, a centre of DIGs,
which is agreed with the conclusion by the reference (Bowen and
Walker, 2005), are relatively weaker compared with B cells, the
major force of DIGs. The weak T cells may be a reason that
cancer cells cannot be killed efﬁciently. Therefore, it is also
advised to add T cells or add the expression levels of T cells
for the treatment of HCV-induced HCC.

4.2 Treatment advices to HBV-induced HCC

HBV is a DNA virus, whose structures are rather stable (Liaw
and Chu, 2009). Unfortunately, the immune system of HBV—
HCC has been seriously damaged, which has been clearly
reﬂected by the downregulated expressions of the DIGs. In this
case, the human body is just like a computer without protection
from anti-virus software. Although the viruses update slowly, the
virus can be inﬁnitely replicated because of the absence of the
protection of anti-virus software. Consequently, the computer or
the human body will eventually collapse.

To treat the HBV-induced HCC, the human body should be
installed with anti-virus software, or called defence system. In
other words, we need to strengthen the immune system of the
patients with HBV-induced HCC, such as increasing immuno-
globulin and T cells, B cells and so on.

5 CONCLUSION

The main contribution is summarized as follows.

5.1 Theory and method

The concept of the DIG has been proposed, and a three-layer
ﬁlter is designed to screen these immune genes. By using the
GPN and DIGF, the degrees of the importance of these genes
have been characterized.

5.2 Experimental results

The 23 key DIGs are screened, which are divided into four
clusters, T cells, B cells, immune signalling and MHC. It is evi-
dent that immune signalling, T cells and B cells form a strong
correlated positive network, where T cells are in the centre, and
B cells and immune signalling are the two main forces in this
community; B cells are the strongest from the viewpoint of dis-
tinction immune gene forces in the community.

5.3 Clinical suggestion

For the HCV-induced HCC, the clinic advice is either to increase
the update speed of antigens or reduce the update speed of the
viruses. Moreover, it is also advised to add T cells or add the
expression levels of T cells to strengthen the ability to kill cancer
cells. For the HBV-induced HCC, the clinic advice is to improve
the immune ability, such as increasing immunoglobulin, T cells
and B cells and so forth.

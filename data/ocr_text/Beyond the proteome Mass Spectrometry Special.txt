Mass spectrometry special interest group (MS-SIG) aims to
bring together experts from the global research community to
discuss highlights and challenges in the ﬁeld of mass spectrom-
etry (MS)-based proteomics and computational biology. The
rapid technological developments in MS-based proteomics
have enabled the generation of a large amount of meaningful
information on hundreds to thousands of proteins simultan-
eously from a biological sample; however, the complexity of
the MS data require sophisticated computational algorithms
and software for data analysis and interpretation. This year’s
MS-SIG meeting theme was ‘Beyond the Proteome’ with major
focuses on improving protein identiﬁcation/quantiﬁcation and
using proteomics data to solve interesting problems in systems
biology and clinical research.

IMPROVING PROTEIN IDENTIFICATION/
QUANTIFICATION

We as the proteomics community need to effectively convey the
conﬁdence levels in the MS measurements of protein abundance
and the subsequent presentation of protein quantitation. The
lack of correlation often found between studies of the proteome
and transcriptome can create a perception challenge that prote-
omics data might not be accurate, and thus, it is important to
develop and apply rigorous computational methods for protein
quantitation. Besides, identifying all proteins in a biological com-
plex is an ongoing challenge. The ﬁrst session was dedicated to
the current developments in these areas.

At the session, Avinash Shanmugam described a strategy to use
RNASeq abundance values and GPMdb protein observation fre-
quencies to adjust the conﬁdence level of protein identiﬁcation
and to improve protein identiﬁcation. Christoph Schaab ad-
dressed the issues of controlling false-positive identiﬁcation
when combining multiple MS datasets. In terms of protein quan-
tiﬁcation, Mikhail Savitski introduced quantiﬁcation quality
scores based on the local slope of the aligned retention times for
label-free approach. For Tandem Mass Tag (TMT) labeled data,
he presented methods to identify signal-to-interfering peak ratios
and suggested ﬁltering the quantiﬁcation results based on these
quality scores to improve the quantiﬁcation accuracy. Working
with data-independent spectral acquisition, Olga Vitek proposed

linear models with an optimal subset of fragments to improve
quantiﬁcation accuracy in this emerging data type. So Young
Ryu developed stochastic censored regression considering inform-
ative missing peptide intensities and unbalanced total number of
quantiﬁed peptides across experiments.

PROTEOMICS IN SYSTEMS BIOLOGY AND
MEDICINE

A critical facet of proteomics is the experimental hypotheses
being explored. The second session of the workshop focused
on translating computational improvements to wet-bench biolo-
gical research. Many biological problems require measuring mul-
tiple types of molecules, and currently, a major challenge is how
to effectively integrate proteomics data with other omics data
such as transcriptomics and metabolomics data. Moreover,
there is an unmet need in systems biology and medicine to
expand proteomics beyond protein quantitation and begin to
systematically assay post-translational modiﬁcations of protein
(e. g. phosphorylation).

In combining protein and mRNA measurements to study cir-
cadian pattern of mouse liver, J ﬁrgen Cox showed that only one-
third of cycling proteins are not accompanied by signiﬁcant
cycling of mRNA, thus relying on post-translational regulation.
David Gibbs explored methods for integrating transcriptome
and proteome data for use with biological networks. Tieliu Shi
expanded the human proteome by mining large collections of
MS and sequencing data. Using chemical—cross—linking MS,
Lars Malmstr6m characterized proteins from the human patho-
gen Streptococcus pyogenes, which play a critical role in the in-
fection process. With top-down proteomics, Julia Chamot—
Rooke characterized novel post-translational modiﬁcations that
regulate infection by Neisseria meningitides.

SOFTWARE AND DATA STANDARD/AVAILABILITY

The computational MS community is beginning to invest in com-
munity tools and standards. This will facilitate an explosion of
ideas that are interoperable and comparable. Frameworks
for creating workﬂows and format standards will make this an
exciting place for computational exploration. Throughout the
workshop were talks about software, data standards and data
repositories to demonstrate how increased compatibility beneﬁts
the community. Oliver Kohlbacher presented the 0pch S/ T OPP

infrastructure. This portable data management and analysis
system allows users to create analysis workﬂows using a variety
of open-source tools. There is also community-wide effort to
standardize MS-data formats and make data available. Andrew
Jones introduced the Proteornics Standards Initiative’s new quan-
titative data format, szuantML. Henning Hermjakob showed
how PRIDE and the ProteomeXchange consortium provide a
data repository with globally coordinated infrastructure.

OPPORTUNITIES FOR BIOINFORMATICIANS IN
PROTEOMICS RESEARCH

Our panel session discussed the current opportunities in compu-
tational proteomics. Many exciting technological developments
have been made in the past decade in the ﬁeld of MS-based
proteomics, and many researchers are now interested in using
proteomics to answer questions in systems biology and medicine.
A consensus of the panelists is that this is an exciting time for
bioinformaticians to study proteomics data and contribute in this

area. To effectively integrate the community efforts, open-source
tools and well-organized platforms for such tools are essential.
The panel also emphasized the importance for bioinformaticians
to communicate effectively with chemists and biologists to de-
velop useful tools for proteomics research. Lastly, young com-
putational biologists would beneﬁt from experiences in MS
laboratory and interactions with experimental scientists.

Additional Information

MS-SIG will be held at ISMB 2014 and aims to bring together
experts from the global research community to discuss current
progress and challenges in the ﬁeld of MS-based proteomics and
computational biology. The meeting will contain three portions:
oral presentation, panel discussion and poster presentation; it
invites abstract submissions on a wide range of topics.

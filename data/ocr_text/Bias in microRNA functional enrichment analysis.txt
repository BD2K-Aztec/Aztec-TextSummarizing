Abstract

Motivation: Many studies have investigated the differential expression of microRNAs (miRNAs)
in disease states and between different treatments, tissues and developmental stages. Given a
list of perturbed miRNAs, it is common to predict the shared pathways on which they act.
The standard test for functional enrichment typically yields dozens of significantly enriched func—
tional categories, many of which appear frequently in the analysis of apparently unrelated diseases
and conditions.

Results: We show that the most commonly used functional enrichment test is inappropriate for the
analysis of sets of genes targeted by miRNAs. The hypergeometric distribution used by the stand—
ard method consistently results in significant P—values for functional enrichment for targets of ran—
domly selected miRNAs, reflecting an underlying bias in the predicted gene targets of miRNAs as a
whole. We developed an algorithm to measure enrichment using an empirical sampling approach,
and applied this in a reanalysis of the gene ontology classes of targets of miRNA lists from 44 pub—
lished studies. The vast majority of the miRNA target sets were not significantly enriched in any
functional category after correction for bias. We therefore argue against continued use of the stand—
ard functional enrichment method for miRNA targets.

1 Introduction

 

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) down—regulate abundance and translation of
target mRNAs through complementary binding to target sites.
miRNAs play important roles in regulating gene expression in re—
sponse to stimuli and during development and their expression pat—
terns can be predictive of disease states (Leidinger et 61]., 2013;
Schratt et 61]., 2006; Xie et 61]., 2013). For this reason, a large number
of studies have investigated the expression of miRNAs in a wide
range of biological conditions. Microarray assays, qRT—PCR and
high—throughput sequencing have all been used to identify differen—
tially expressed miRNAs in disease states, between different tissues
and during development (Davidson et 61]., 2010; Liang et 61]., 2013;
Wu et 61]., 2012a). Unfortunately, the interpretation of miRNA

differential expression is not straightforward. The roles of individual
miRNAs in cellular pathways are still poorly understood. Each
miRNA has the potential to target hundreds of different genes,
meaning that perturbation of a single miRNA may affect many bio—
logical functions (Friedman and Farh, 2009). This motivates a broad
view: given a list of differentially expressed miRNAs, we must look
for the functions or pathways on which they converge.

Here, we examine the most common method of miRNA func-
tional enrichment analysis, used in hundreds of published studies.
This method consists of three steps: finding which genes are targeted
by selected miRNAs, annotating target genes for their participation in
pathways and processes, and statistical testing for over—representation
of a biological process in the set of targeted genes (Gusev et 61]., 2007).

Bias in miRNA functional enrichment analysis

For the first step, computational target prediction is usually necessary
because experimental datasets covering miRNA—mRNA interactions
on a genome scale are currently lacking. For the second step, annota—
tion by gene ontology (GO) term membership or Kyoto Encyclopedia
of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways is common (Ashburner
et 61]., 2000; Kanehisa and Goto, 2000). For the final step, the hyper-
geometric distribution, or equivalently Fisher’s exact test, is used to
test for enrichment. The hypergeometric distribution describes the
situation where samples are picked uniformly at random from a finite
population which contains a labelled subset. In the context of func—
tional enrichment, it gives the probability of targeting 13 genes from a
labelled category when targeting a total of 11 genes from the genome.
We can then use this distribution to test the null hypothesis that genes
were targeted randomly versus the alternative that genes belonging to
a given annotation were preferentially targeted.

This approach, which we here refer to as the ‘standard method’
because of its preponderance, consistently produces a large number
of significantly enriched processes. However, these are often difficult
to interpret and full lists of significant terms are rarely provided in
published articles. Recurrence of GO terms between apparently un—
related diseases and conditions in the literature is very notable (Lu
et 61]., 2012). Most worryingly, even random and meaningless
miRNA lists produce significant functional enrichments using the
standard method (Ritchie et 61]., 2009).

In this study, we show that critical problems with the standard
method arise because of bias in the sets of genes that are predicted
to be targeted by miRNAs in general. This means that the assump—
tion of uniform sampling in the hypergeometric distribution is not
reasonable. We correct for this bias by bringing the statistical test
back from the level of genes to the level of miRNAs and show that
most functions reported as significantly enriched in the literature do
not remain so after correction.

2 Methods

We developed an algorithm to find the empirical distribution of the
number of miRNA target genes within annotated functional catego—
ries. We predicted targets of all miRBase release 20 annotated ma—
ture miRNAs in the 3’ UTRs of all Ensembl release 75 human and
mouse genes using miRanda (version 3.3a, free energy< —20 kcal/
mol, score > 155) (Enright et 61]., 2003). Annotated biological pro—
cess GO terms for all human and mouse genes were downloaded
from Ensembl (Ashburner et 61]., 2000; Kinsella et 61]., 2011).
Following the standard method, we defined the target genes for a
list of miRNAs as the union of genes predicted to be targeted by
each miRNA. We then calculated GO term overlap as the propor—
tion of target genes which were annotated as belonging to a given
GO term. Our empirical algorithm first counted the GO term over—
lap for targets of an input miRNA list. A set of miRNAs of the same
size as the input list was randomly sampled without replacement
from the set of all annotated miRNAs, with one million iterations.
An empirical P-value for each GO term was calculated using the
proportion of simulations that produced an equal or greater GO
term overlap. We also developed a modified multi—hit version of this
algorithm that did not use the simple union of target genes, but in—
stead gave each gene a score given by the sum of the number of pre-
dicted target binding sites for all input miRNAs. GO term overlap
was then defined as the score for genes annotated with a given GO
term divided by total score for input miRNAs. We repeated all ana—
lyses using KEGG pathways [accessed through the KEGG.db
Bioconductor package, which archives KEGG data from March 15,

2011 (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000)] in place of GO terms. We also
recalculated target predictions based on the intersection of genes re—
turned by three alternative target prediction algorithms: PITA pre-
dictions from the PITA Targets Catalog version 6 (August 2008)
based on mm9 and hg18 for mouse and human, respectively, with
zero flank and all sites included (Kertesz et 61]., 2007); DIANA—
microT-v4 predictions, which use miRBase annotated miRNAs and
Ensembl 3’ UTR sequences (Reczko et 61]., 2012); and canonical seed
matches between miRBase miRNAs and Ensembl 3’ UTR sequences
as in (Bartel, 2009). We used miRBase alias data to match the names
of miRNAs in downloaded prediction sets to their current annota—
tions (Kozomara and Griffiths—Jones, 2011) and Ensembl gene syno—
nyms to match gene names in the target sets to Ensembl GO
classifications.

We investigated the effects of filtering miRNA target predictions
for experimentally supported target sites, similar to the approach of
miRFunction (Li et al., 2014). Thirty—six human and five mouse
AGO pulldown CLIP—seq datasets were downloaded from starBase
(Li et 61]., 2014). Target predictions from miRanda were mapped to
genomic loci and filtered to include only those supported by at least
one experimental dataset.

We also investigated the use of the standard method in studies of
plant miRNAs. We predicted TIGR genome cDNA (OSA1R5) tar—
gets of miRBase—annotated rice miRNAs using psRNATarget with
default parameters (Dai and Zhao, 2011). We matched the TIGR
loci to GO annotations in tables downloaded from the agriGO data—
base (Du et 61]., 2010).

We performed a literature survey to identify studies that fol—
lowed the standard method. We used the search functions provided
by Nature Publishing Group and Public Library of Science, as well
as Google Scholar, with the search terms ‘gene ontology’ and
‘microRNA’ for mouse and human and ‘oryza’ and ‘microRNA’ for
rice. Each article was manually checked to confirm that the standard
method was followed. Lists of miRNAs reported to be differentially
expressed (or otherwise flagged) were manually compiled from the
retrieved articles. Where multiple lists of miRNAs were assessed in
the same manuscript, we arbitrarily chose one list for testing. We de—
fine results as significant by default where oc < 0.05. In the case of
multiple testing, we perform Benjamini—Hochberg adjustment and
report significant items passing the threshold for false discovery
rate < 0.05 (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3 Results

3.1 Assessing the appropriateness of the
hypergeometric distribution

We used our algorithm to investigate whether the null hypothesis
used by the standard method was appropriate by comparing the
hypergeometric distribution with an empirical distribution for the
number of predicted target genes belonging to a GO term for ran—
domly sampled miRNAs. As an illustration, we use the GO term
‘ion transport’ (GO:0006811), which is often reported as signifi-
cantly enriched in the literature (Liu et 61]., 2010; Sokolov et 61].,
2012; Yunta et 61]., 2012). We predicted the targets of an example
set of 39 miRNAs that were reported as differentially expressed in
one study (Sokolov et 61]., 2012). These miRNAs were predicted to
target 10 057 genes out of 15 733 genes with at least one assigned
biological process GO term, of which 327 are annotated for ion
transport. These parameters were chosen to mirror the methods
used by the popular tool DAVID (Huang et 61]., 2009). The expected
distribution of the number of target genes assigned to the

Number e1 predicted targets in GO term

Fig. 1. Expected and empirical number of predicted targets of randomly se-
lected microRNAs. For an example 39 miRNAs, we calculate the hypergeo-
metric distribution (blue) for the number of expected targets in the GO term
‘ion transport' (GO:0006811). The empirical distribution (red) represents the
predicted targets of random samples of 39 miRNAs. The probability for each
5-gene bin is given according to both distributions

‘ion transport’ GO term according to the hypergeometric distribu—
tion is shown in Figure 1, alongside the distribution of the number
of target genes of 1 million randomly chosen sets of 39 miRNAs.
The data clearly show that the hypergeometric distribution does not
adequately model the empirical background distribution under these
conditions.

Figure 1 immediately suggests an explanation for the excess of
significant GO terms under the standard method. A typical miRNA
target gene set, with GO membership near the mean of the empirical
distribution, will produce significant P—values for GO term enrich-
ment using the standard method. Indeed, the mean number of tar—
gets involved in ion transport for 39 random miRNAs (250 genes)
gave a P—value of 5.97 X 10—7 when tested using the hypergeometric
distribution. We compared the hypergeometric with the empirical
distributions for all biological process GO terms. For each GO term,
we constructed the hypergeometric distribution using the same ex—
ample of 39 miRNAs targeting 10 05 7 genes as predicted by
miRanda, again mirroring a common DAVID analysis (Enright
et al., 2003; Huang et al., 2009). For each GO term, we then gener—
ated an empirical distribution for the number of member genes tar—
geted by 39 randomly selected miRNAs. Supplementary Table S1
lists the one—sided P—value on the hypergeometric distribution of the
mean of the empirical distribution for each GO term. Smaller P—val—
ues represent terms that are more likely to be erroneously reported
as significantly enriched using the standard method. Among the
terms yielding the smallest P—values (Table 1), several are notably
often reported as enriched in the literature, such as ‘regulation of
transcription, DNA—dependent’ (GO:0006355) (Kraemer et al.,
2013; Mizuguchi et al., 2011; Munch et al., 2013; Ziats and
Rennert, 2013).

Other GO terms suffered from an opposite bias, making detec—
tion of a significant enrichment almost impossible under the stand—
ard method. The most extreme of these with more than five
members were ‘defense response to bacterium’, ‘detection of chem—
ical stimulus involved in sensory perception of smell’ and ‘G—protein

terms were conspicuously absent from published lists of enriched
processes in disease. These results imply that using the hypergeomet—
ric distribution to model miRNA target gene GO term membership
is inappropriate and is liable to produce spurious results.

3.2 Re—analysis of published miRNA lists

We investigated the prevalence of the standard method with a non—
exhaustive manual search of journal articles. We identified 40 pub—
lished studies where the standard method was applied to investigate
functional enrichment of targets of sets of animal miRNAs
(Supplementary Table S2). Among these, a wide range of algorithms
and their combinations were used for target prediction. Six different
organisms were represented in studies ranging from sea cucumber
aestivation to pseudorabies virus in pig cell lines (Chen et al., 2013a;
Wu et al., 2012b). A large number of different web servers provided
tools for functional annotation and statistical testing of enrichment.
The types of functional categories tested included biological process
GO terms with various filters and KEGG pathways (Huang et al.,
2009). The list included recent and high—impact publications (e.g.
Soh et al., 2013). Although functional enrichment analysis was gen-
erally not the central focus of these studies, it was mentioned in 26
out of 40 abstracts. Only a small subset of the published studies we
surveyed provided a full list of significantly enriched functional cate—
gories. Several studies, however, reported in the main manuscript on
a few significant GO terms appealing for interpretation (e.g. Ma
et al., 2013). Readers are likely to be unaware that hundreds of
other GO terms are equally enriched. Although not fundamental to
the standard method, this problem is exacerbated by its unfailing
production of large numbers of significantly enriched terms.

We were able to collect lists of differentially expressed (or otherwise
ﬂagged) miRNAs from 22 studies in humans and 7 studies in mice for
analysis with our empirical algorithm (Supplementary Table S3).
Where a study performed enrichment analysis for multiple miRNA
lists, we arbitrarily selected one list per published study. In order to

mirror the approaches in published studies as closely as possible, where
each miRNA was analysed separately, we also applied the empirical al—
gorithm in a single test of only one miRNA. We converted miRNA
names to their current annotations, removing 10 miRNAs whose
miRBase entries had been deleted since publication (Kozomara and
Griffiths-Jones, 2011). For each input miRNA list, we ran our algo—
rithm with miRanda predictions (Enright et al., 2003), biological pro—
cess GO term annotations (Ashburner et al., 2000; Huang et al., 2009)
and one million iterations of randomly selected miRNAs, generating
empirical distributions of GO term target gene overlap for the specified
numbers of input miRNAs and outputting P—values for the enrichment
of GO terms.

After Benjamini—Hochberg correction for multiple testing
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995 ), we observed an enrichment of any
GO term in only 5 out of 22 human and 0 out of 7 mouse studies
(Table 2). In contrast, all of the published studies reported multiple

enriched functional categories. Although our aim is to provide a
controlled comparison of standard and empirical methods, rather
than to attempt to replicate the exact prediction and annotation
methods of the previous studies, these results show that most func—
tional categories reported to be enriched in the literature would not
remain so after correction for bias.

We also investigated the use of the standard method in plant stud—
ies, using miRNA lists from four published rice articles as a test set
(Supplementary Table S4). Following a typical analysis procedure, we
ran our algorithm with these miRNA input lists, target prediction ob—
tained using psRNATarget and GO annotations obtained from
agriGO (Dai and Zhao, 2011; Du et al., 2010). We found significant
enrichments in two out of the four input lists (Table 3), suggesting a
similar general pattern to that in humans and mice.

3.3 Robustness to prediction and annotation methods
Our results are robust to changes within the general framework of
the standard method. Subsets of GO are often used in the literature.
We therefore repeated all analyses using the filtered GO term anno—
tation set BP_FAT downloaded from the DAVID Knowledgebase
(Huang et al., 2009), with very similar results. As an alternative to
biological process GO terms, we also used KEGG pathway annota—
tions. Running the empirical algorithm with the published miRNA
lists, 8 out of 29 miRNA lists produced at least one significantly en—
riched KEGG pathway. It is common to predict targets of miRNAs
using several programs and to use the intersection set of their out—
puts. As an alternative to prediction by miRanda (Enright et al.,
2003) alone, we used the intersection set of target predictions by
PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007), DIANA—microT—v4 (Reczko et al.,
2012) and seed matching using canonical seeds (Bartel, 2009). These
downloaded prediction sets did not include all currently annotated
miRNAs; in particular 134 of the miRNAs from input lists were
missing and so had to be excluded. Using this prediction method, 3
of the 29 miRNA lists from published studies produced significantly
enriched biological process GO terms. We also filtered target predic—
tion sets to include only miRanda target loci supported by CLIP—seq
data (see Section 2), similar to the miRFunction approach (Li et al.,
2014). This had the effect of drastically reducing the number of pre—
dicted targets per miRNA. A similar pattern was observed, with no
significant enrichments for 18 out of 22 human and 7 out of 7
mouse miRNA lists (Supplementary Table S2). The lack of enrich-
ment is, therefore, robust to the number of predicted targets.

We tested whether our algorithm was able to detect functional
enrichment when the input miRNAs were artificially selected for
their targeting of a given process. We manually selected as an input
set the eight miRNAs with the most predicted targets in the process
‘regulation of axonogenesis’ (GO:005 0770). As expected, the algo—
rithm found that the same GO term was significantly enriched, as
well as other related and unrelated terms (Supplementary Table SS ).

3.4 Testing for multi—hit convergence on processes

The standard method in its simplest form counts each gene once,
whether it is targeted by one or many differentially expressed
miRNAs, losing key information on functional convergence (Gusev,
2008; Lee et al., 2012). Filters on target gene sets or on output GO
terms have been proposed previously to resolve this problem
(Gusev, 2008; Hu et al., 2014). These filters require the proportion
of miRNAs targeting a gene and the proportion of miRNAs with at
least one target in a GO term to pass defined thresholds. Another al—
ternative is to apply the statistical test on miRNA—mRNA pair con-
nections (Lee et al., 2012). We therefore modified our algorithm to
address this issue while maintaining our simple hypothesis testing
approach and the principled comparison with the empirical distribu—
tion. The set of target genes for an input miRNA list was previously
defined as the union of predicted target genes. In our modified algo—
rithm, each gene is assigned a score for strength of interaction with
miRNAs based on the total number of predicted binding sites,
including multiple sites for the same miRNA. The score for a GO
term is then the sum of gene scores for its members, divided by the
total number of binding sites for the miRNAs. As above, we run one
million iterations with randomly sampled miRNAs and compare the
GO term scores for differentially expressed miRNAs with this em-
pirical distribution.

Results from our modified algorithm applied to previously iden—
tified miRNA lists are shown in Table 2. Significant enrichments
were found for all the input lists that had positive results for the ori—
ginal basic algorithm, albeit with more modest numbers of signifi-
cant GO terms. Enrichments were also detected from six lists where
previously they were not found.

4 Discussion

Our comparison of the hypergeometric and empirical distributions
showed that certain functional categories are preferentially targeted
by miRNAs, regardless of whether those miRNAs are differentially
expressed in a biological state or not. It is not helpful to report a GO
term as enriched for targets of differentially expressed miRNAs if an
equally strong enrichment would be obtained for randomly picked
miRNAs. This justifies an empirical sampling approach, which
measures enrichment relative to other miRNAs, in comparison to
the standard method, which does not take into account the back—
ground level of targeting of a GO term. There are several possible
explanations for the phenomenon of preferential targeting by
miRNAs, including bias in target prediction algorithms, similarities
among seed sequences, correlations between genes that are regulated
together and genuine preference for control of certain biological
processes by different mechanisms. One clear source of bias is aver—
age 3’ UTR length of genes annotated to specific GO terms. When
we use the P—value of the mean of the empirical distribution on the
hypergeometric distribution (Table 1) as a measure for bias of a GO
term, we observe a strong negative correlation with average 3’ UTR
length of genes assigned to that GO term (Pearson’s r: —0.36;
P25 .3 X 10—287). We also note that many GO terms were invari—
ably returned together as enriched. This may reflect underlying cor-
relations between targeting of processes as well as the hierarchical
structure of the GO.

The simplest use of functional enrichment tests examines a set of
genes with a common characteristic—for example, a set of differen-
tially expressed genes, or a set of genes with particular genomic
properties. The test described here is subtly different: a set of
miRNAs is defined by differential expression and that set is one step

removed (by miRNA target prediction) from the set of genes whose
functional enrichment is tested. The bias in the underlying expected
distribution of functional categories comes from the process of link-
ing miRNAs with their target genes. While we have examined only a
specific use of the functional enrichment test, similar biases
may affect other genomic enrichment tests (Slowikowski et al.,
2014). For example, ChIP-seq identification of transcription factor—
binding sites followed by functional enrichment of the target gene
set is analogous to the analyses described here. Further investigation
is therefore required to determine the appropriateness of the hyper—
geometric distribution for other types of functional enrichment
studies.

In our literature survey, we identified 44 journal articles that
used the standard method. However, our list was not exhaustive
and excluded studies with relatively minor deviations from the
standard method, such as those that implemented more complex fil-
ters for selection of target genes (Cho et al., 2013) and those that
performed tests based on combined targeting by miRNAs (Lee et al.,
2012). Altogether, we estimate that hundreds of published articles
are likely to be affected by the bias described here. In the application
of the empirical algorithm to miRNA lists from these studies, we do
not attempt to directly replicate methods used and instead show a
pattern in results that strongly suggests that most reported enrich—
ments would not be found with correction for bias. We also do not
directly compare the significant enrichments output by our algo—
rithm with those reported, as the specific types of functional catego—
ries assayed, such as GO term collections assembled by DAVID
(Huang et al., 2009), vary greatly and full lists of significant terms
are rarely published.

Our results do not imply that differentially expressed miRNAs
do not converge on functions of interest. It is notable that the num—
ber of significantly enriched GO terms increased with the number of
miRNAs input to our algorithm. This may be because noise domin—
ates for smaller lists, whereas a larger number of input miRNAs pro-
vides more signal of convergence on a process. While modest
enrichment of a function for a single miRNA is undetectable, the
combination of many small enrichments for a larger collection of
miRNAs passes significance thresholds. Five of the largest input
miRNA lists (Chen et al., 2010; Romero—Cordoba et al., 2012;
Sanchez—Dial et al., 2013; Tanic and Andres, 2013; Wu et al., 2011)
had extremely convergent miRNA target sets (for example (Chen
et al., 2010) had a predicted target set significantly smaller than ex-
pected [P < 10—5]). Convergent target sets mean that any GO term
hit by chance will contain a higher proportion of the target set, caus—
ing more significant GO terms to be returned. There have been other
proposals to try to harness the convergence of miRNAs and to im-
prove enrichment analysis. The miRSystem tool gives a P—value
based on the tendency for the standard method to consistently find
the same significant GO terms (Lu et al., 2012). By comparing the
order of enrichment for a new sample with the order for random
miRNAs, outstanding changes can be identified. Although use of a
pre—computed distribution limits the ﬂexibility of miRSystem, the
approach escapes the problem of bias reported here (Lu et al.,
2012). In general, however, there remains an unfulfilled need for
more powerful and accurate bioinformatic tools to link miRNAs to
functions.

5 Conclusion

We have highlighted critical problems with the most common
general approach to functional enrichment analysis of miRNA

Bias in miRNA functional enrichment analysis

target genes. We have shown that testing with the hypergeometric
distribution sampling from all GO annotated genes in the genome is
inappropriate. Our literature survey showed that a large number of
studies reported significant results that are unlikely to stand after
correction for the bias in the distribution of targets of randomly
sampled miRNAs. We believe that our results provide a strong argu—
ment against continued use of the standard method.

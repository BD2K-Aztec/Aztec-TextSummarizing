ABSTRACT

Summary: Driven by dramatic technological improvements,
large-scale characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires via
high-throughput sequencing is now feasible. Although promising, the
high germline and somatic diversity, especially of B-cell immunoglobu-
lin repertoires, presents challenges for analysis requiring the develop-
ment of specialized computational pipelines. We developed the
REpertoire Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO) for processing reads from
high-throughput lymphocyte receptor studies. pRESTO processes raw
sequences to produce error-corrected, sorted and annotated se-
quence sets, along with a wealth of metrics at each step. The toolkit
supports multiplexed primer pools, single- or paired-end reads and
emerging technologies that use single-molecule identifiers. pRESTO
has been tested on data generated from Roche and Illumina platforms.
It has a built-in capacity to parallelize the work between available
processors and is able to efficiently process millions of sequences
generated by typical high-throughput projects.

Availability and implementation: pRESTO is freely available for aca-
demic use. The software package and detailed tutorials may be down-
loaded from http://clip.med.yale.edu/presto.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput sequencing technologies now enable large-scale
characterization of lymphocyte receptor repertoires (Rep-Seq)
(Benichou et al., 2012). Rep-Seq studies have used a variety of
next-generation sequencing platforms, including Roche’s 454
and Illumina’s Genome Analyzer. Researchers are now begin-
ning to take advantage of newer platforms, such as the MiSeq
offered by Illumina, which can generate >10 million paired-end

300 base-pair reads in a single run. Many experimental protocols
take advantage of these high read volumes by tagging reads with
sample-speciﬁc barcode sequences and multiplexing sample
groups. More recently, protocols to barcode single mRNA mol-
ecules with unique identiﬁers (UID) before PCR amplification
have emerged (Shiroguchi et al., 2012; Volhners et al., 2013),
allowing PCR amplification effects to be resolved and offering
the potential to dramatically reduce sequencing-dependent error
rates using single-molecule consensus reads.

We have developed a suite of utilities, the REpertoire
Sequencing TOolkit (pRESTO), that provides an integrated
framework to handle all stages of sequence processing prior to
germline segment assignment, which may then be handled by
other available software such as IMGT/HighV—QUEST
(Alamyar et al., 2012). pRESTO is designed to handle either
single- or paired-end reads, has been tested on data from both
the Roche 454 and Illumina MiSeq platforms and includes a
wide range of features designed to meet the needs of various
Rep-Seq protocols; see Supplementary Material Section 1.1
and Supplementary Tables S1 and S2.

2 FEATURES

2.1 Overview and implementation

The pRESTO software package is provided as a set of com-
mand-line utilities, all of which are implemented as platform-
independent Python modules. pRESTO is designed to allow
for maximum flexibility in workﬂow organization to meet the
unique needs of different sequencing projects. Particular
emphasis is placed on providing support for multiplexed primers,
multiplexed sample pools and emerging technologies that use
UID barcoding. However, pRESTO is equally suitable for
experimental protocols that do not use complex mixtures of
molecular tags. Each tool accepts sequences in the form of
FASTA or FASTQ (with Phred scoring scheme) files.
The more computationally expensive tools in the pRESTO
suite are natively parallelized, allowing users to take advantage
of multicore systems by specifying the number of subprocesses to
execute. Additionally, pRESTO allows users to easily integrate

Fig. 1. Example workﬂow diagram. Example workﬂows for single-end
read sequencing protocols with sample barcoding (left) and paired-end
read protocols with/without UID barcoding (right). Single sequence ﬁle
inputs are shown with single arrowheads, and parallel processing of two
paired-end read ﬁles are shown with a double arrowhead

automatic ﬁle segregation into their workﬁow for distributed
processing on cluster computing resources. A detailed descrip-
tion of each pRESTO tool is provided in the Supplementary
Material (summarized in Supplementary Table S1). Example
datasets with step-by-step tutorials covering the workﬂows illu-
strated in Figure 1 can be found on the pRESTO website.

2.2 Annotation

To meet the particular needs of Rep-Seq projects, pRESTO uses
an annotation scheme that labels individual reads by extending
the sequence descriptions (Supplementary Material Section 2.1
and Supplementary Fig. S1). pRESTO’s annotation features
allow users to sort and subset the sequences in multiplexed
runs, simplifying the workﬁow and reducing the chance of
human error. For example, within a single multiplexed run, the
receptor isotype is often determined by the particular constant
region primer sequence. pRESTO’s annotation system associates
this information with each read, rather than requiring a complex
system of separate ﬁles for each set of annotations, thereby sim-
plifying comparative analysis.

pRESTO provides several methods for manipulating these an-
notations, allowing pipelines to be customized by integrating
textual or arithmetic sequence ﬁlters into the workﬁow
(Supplementary Material Sections 2.10 and 2.11). Beyond the
default annotations, more detailed sequence-speciﬁc information
can be captured through pRESTO’s logging features. pRESTO

can convert both sequence-embedded and logged annotations
into data tables suitable for automated analysis and plotting
(Supplementary Material Sections 2.11 and 2.12).

2.3 Quality control and error proﬁling

pRESTO provides comprehensive quality control tools to ﬁlter
reads based on sequence properties such as Phred quality scores
(Supplementary Material Section 2.2), valid barcode labeling
(Supplementary Material Section 2.3), primer identity
(Supplementary Material Section 2.3) and abundance of dupli-
cate reads (Supplementary Material Section 2.9). pRESTO also
provides tools to measure the diversity and error proﬁles of sets
of annotated reads (Supplementary Material Sections 2.5 and
2.8); such information may be used to estimate sequencing
error rates and remove highly variable UID read groups from
the analysis.

2.4 UID barcoding and paired-end reads

Recent advances in Rep-Seq protocols are allowing researchers
to improve both the sequencing and quantiﬁcation accuracy of
repertoire data by labeling each starting nucleic acid sequence
with a unique single-molecule identiﬁer (UID) before ampliﬁca-
tion (Shiroguchi et al., 2012; Volhners et al., 2013). The pRESTO
suite includes special operations tailored for UID barcoding
technologies, including tools to multiple align UID read groups
(Supplementary Material Section 2.5) and generate consensus
sequences from UID read groups (Supplementary Material
Section 2.6).

pRESTO also provides support for de novo assembly of over-
lapping paired-end reads (Supplementary Material Section 2.7).
pRESTO does not require maintenance of ﬁle ordering across
pair-end read ﬁles, facilitating independent ﬁltering of separate
paired-end read ﬁles. However, the sequence sampling and sort-
ing tools may operate in a paired-end mode, allowing users to
create uniformly ordered paired-end ﬁles (Supplementary
Material Section 2.10). pRESTO allows users to propagate an-
notations between paired-end records (Supplementary Material
Section 2.4), which is required for protocols where the sample
barcode or UID are found on only one read of the mate pair.

3 CONCLUSIONS

We have developed a ﬂexible toolkit, pRESTO, for rapid pro-
cessing of high-throughput lymphocyte receptor sequencing data
originating from either mRNA or DNA templates. pRESTO is
compatible with the latest molecular barcoding and sequencing
technologies and provides a means to generate high-ﬁdelity rep-
ertoire datasets. This output can be used to drive subsequent
analysis, such as (i) identifying V(D)J gene segments (Alamyar
et al., 2012; Ga'eta et al., 2007; Thomas et al., 2013; Volpe et al.,
2006; Ye et al., 2013), (ii) clustering clonally related sequences
(Chen et al., 2010), (iii) inferring individual genotypes (Kidd
et al., 2012), (iv) creating lineage trees (Barak et al., 2008), (v)
quantifying afﬁnity-dependent selection (Yaari et al., 2012) and
(vi) analysis of somatic hypermutation patterns (Yaari et al.,
2013). The software package, detailed example workﬂows and
sample datasets are available online at http://clip.med.yale.

Abstract

Motivation: It has been known that mature transfer RNAs (tRNAs) that are encoded in the nuclear
genome give rise to short molecules, collectively known as tRNA fragments or tRFs. Recently, we
reported that, in healthy individuals and in patients, tRFs are constitutive, arise from mitochondrial
as well as from nuclear tRNAs, and have composition and abundances that depend on a person’s
sex, population origin and race as well as on tissue, disease and disease subtype. Our findings as
well as similar work by other groups highlight the importance of tRFs and presage an increase in
the community’s interest in elucidating the roles of tRFs in health and disease.

Results: We created MlNTbase, a web—based framework that serves the dual—purpose of being a con—
tent repository for tRFs and a tool for the interactive exploration of these newly discovered molecules.
A key feature of MlNTbase is that it deterministically and exhaustively enumerates all possible gen—
omic locations where a sequence fragment can be found and indicates which fragments are exclusive
to tRNA space, and thus can be considered as tRFs: this is a very important consideration given that
the genomes of higher organisms are riddled with partial tRNA sequences and with tRNA—lookalikes
whose aberrant transcripts can be mistaken for tRFs. MlNTbase is extremely flexible and integrates
and presents tRF information from multiple yet interconnected vantage points (‘vistas’). Vistas permit
the user to interactively personalize the information that is returned and the manner in which it is dis—
played. MlNTbase can report comparative information on how a tRF is distributed across all anti—
codon/amino acid combinations, provides alignments between a tRNA and multiple tRFs with which
the user can interact, provides details on published studies that reported a tRF as expressed, etc.
lmportantly, we designed MlNTbase to contain all possible tRFs that could ever be produced by ma—
ture tRNAs: this allows us to report on their genomic distributions, anticodon/amino acid properties,
alignments, etc. while giving users the ability to at-Will investigate candidate tRF molecules before em—
barking on focused experimental explorations. Lastly, we also introduce a new labeling scheme that is
tRF—sequence—based and allows users to associate a tRF with a universally unique label (‘tRF—license
plate’) that is independent of a genome assembly and does not require any brokering mechanism.

1 Introduction

Transfer RNA (tRNA) molecules serve as the bridge between the
messenger RNA that is being translated and the newly synthesized
polypeptide chain, and, thus, are an integral part of the translation
process, as described by the central dogma of biology (Barciszewska
et al., 2016). Not surprisingly, tRNAs have long been considered to
serve as housekeeping molecules.

In recent years, the use of next generation sequencing to investi—
gate cellular transcriptomes has uncovered ample evidence that a
tRNA can also be a source of a rich repertoire of non—coding RNAs
(ncRNAs) (Gebetsberger and Polacek, 2013; Shigematsu et al.,
2014; Sobala and Hutvagner, 2011). These derivative molecules are
referred to as tRNA—derived fragments or tRFs, are generally short,
correspond to segments of variable length and their functions are
largely unknown. It is important to note that tRFs are not restricted
to human biology; indeed, they have been reported in multiple or—
ganisms (Casas et al., 2015; Hirose et al., 2015; Karaiskos et al.,
2015; Kumar et al., 2014).

Earlier work (Gebetsberger and Polacek, 2013; Kumar et al.,
2014) recognized four structural types of molecules originating from
the mature tRNA: 5’—halves, 3’—halves, 5’—tRFs and 3’—tRFs (Fig. 1).
The 5’—halves and 3’—halves result from Angiogenin cleavage of the
mature tRNA at the anticodon loop, and are typically 33 nucleotides
(nt) in length. The 5’ -tRFs and 3’—tRFs are of variable length, shorter
than halves (S 30 nt) and originate from cleavage of the mature
tRNA at the D and T arms, respectively.

In recent work, we described a previously unreported fifth struc—
tural type of tRFs, the internal tRFs or i—tRFs (Telonis et al., 2015).
The sequences of i—tRFs are wholly contained within the span of the
mature tRNA sequence (Fig. 1). In terms of length, i—tRFs are atyp—
ical in that they can be as short as 5’—tRFs/3’—tRFs (e.g. 17—mers) and

at least as long as 5’—halves/3’—halves (e.g. 33—mers) (Telonis et al.,
2015). We also found that the 5’—tRF and 3’—tRF types have richer
diversity than previously known, comprising molecules with many
distinct and quantized lengths. In addition, we showed that the
tRNAs of the mitochondrial genome (‘mitochondrially encoded’)
are a very rich source of both halves and tRFs, just like the tRNAs
that are encoded by the nuclear genome (‘nuclearly encoded’).
Interestingly, the length distribution and other properties of all five
structural types of fragments that are derived from mitochondrially
encoded tRNAs differ from those of the fragments arising from
nuclearly encoded tRNAs (Telonis et al., 2015 ).

In terms of function, tRFs are diverse. Not only has loading on
Argonaute (Ago) and participation in transcriptional repression
been associated with tRFs (Kumar et al., 2014; Shigematsu and
Kirino, 2015; Sobala and Hutvagner, 2011; Telonis et al., 2015),
but it is also a cell—type—dependent process as we reported in
(Telonis et al., 2015). The regulation of translation initiation
(Ivanov et al., 2011), the formation of stress granules (Emara et al.,
2010), and the displacement of mRNAs from RNA-binding proteins
by the newly discovered i—tRFs (Goodarzi et al., 2015) are also
among the tRFs’ emerging roles. Recently, our group also showed
that the structural type of tRNA—half can adopt multiple active
instances that are distinguished by differences in their 3’ -terminus
modifications (e.g. a cyclic phosphate group instead of the typical
hydroxyl), that the expression of these modified tRNA halves
(‘SHOT—RNAS’) can depend on sex hormones, and that their silenc—
ing impedes cell proliferation (Honda et al., 2015 ).

Working with transcriptomes from human tissues, instead of cell
lines, we were able to generate evidence of intriguing associations
involving tRNA fragments. In particular, we showed that the ex—
pression profiles of 5’—halves, 3’—halves, 5’—tRFs, 3’—tRFs and i—tRFs
from mitochondrially and nuclearly encoded tRNAs depend on tis—
sue, tissue state, disease subtype and on an individual’s sex, popula—
tion origin and race (Telonis et al., 2015 ). Moreover, we showed
that these molecules are produced constitutively (Telonis et al.,
2015

Our discoveries of the existence of richer categories of 5’—/3’—
tRFs and of the previously unrecognized i—tRFs, our finding that
mitochondrially encoded tRNAs are also sources of tRNA fragments
with profiles that differ distinctly from those of their nuclearly
encoded counterparts as well as the numerous dependencies on tis—
sue, disease and an individual’s attributes, which we uncovered, gen—
erate an acute need for an integrated and multi—faceted access to this
knowledge. The current solutions, e.g. (Kumar et al., 2015 ), only
partially meet this need while also offering limited search and user—
interaction capabilities. Moreover, by considering short sequences
(e.g. 14—nt, 15 —nt, 16—nt, etc.) in a probabilistic search scheme whose
performance is known to be inﬂuenced by the length of the query
(Gusfield, 1997), instead of employing a deterministic and exhaust—
ive approach such as the one we described in (Telonis et al., 2015 ),
the current schemes increase the likelihood that aberrant transcripts
will be misreported as tRFs (Kumar et al., 2014). Compounding
these limitations are several facts that pertain to the idiosyncrasies
of tRNA sequences and impose very concrete limitations on how
one must go about identifying tRNA fragments among the reads of
next generation sequencing datasets. As we detailed at length in
(Telonis et al., 2015), and more recently in (Telonis et al., 2016), the

MlNTbase: a framework for the interactive exploration of mitochondrial and nuclear tRNA fragments 2483

 

mapping of such reads must be deterministic and exhaustive, should
not permit replacements or insertions/deletions, and, most import—
antly, take into account the fact that the human genome is riddled
with partial tRNA sequences and with tRNA—lookalikes (Telonis
et al., 2014).

Here, we present a knowledge repository and interactive frame—
work for the exploration of mi—tochondrial and n—uclear t—RFs
(MINTbase). MINTbase recognizes that distinct isodecoders of the
same anticodon comprise sequence segments that can differ ever so
slightly from one another. Consequently, MINTbase does not group
together instances of a structural type across isodecoders of the
same anticodon (e.g. the 5’—halves from all AspGTC isodecoders): if
we were to allow such a grouping, we would hinder the user’s ability
to elucidate the differences of these distinct instances in terms of
transcription and of genomic distribution. Instead, MINTbase treats
each such tRF as a molecule that can be studied independently in its
own right. MINTbase also introduces and adopts a second labeling
scheme, one that associates each tRF with a unique label (‘tRF-li-
cense plate’) that is derived from the tRF’s nucleotide sequence. The
uniqueness of the label ensures that a tRF—license plate corresponds
to a unique nucleotide sequence. This new labeling approach com—
plements the genome—centric labeling scheme that we introduced in
(Telonis et al., 2015 ), and which is also used by MINTbase.

MINTbase comprehensively embraces this newly discovered
complexity of the tRF biology, incorporates the latest discoveries in
this field, brings about the various interconnections among tRFs and
provides access to what is already known z/ia goal—oriented displays
while also remaining flexible enough to easily accommodate future
discoveries. MINTbase is freely accessible at http://cm.jefferson.edu/
MINTbase/. Codes for generating tRF—license plates and for con—
verting them back to nucleotide sequences are available at https://
cm.jefferson.edu/MINTcodes/.

2 Implementation

For the purposes of this presentation, we define as ‘tRF’, or ‘tRNA—
derived fragment’, any sequence segment of mature tRNA with
length between 16 and 50 nt inclusive (Telonis et al., 2015). This
choice of length range for tRFs is dictated by the information that is
currently available in the literature. Should subsequent studies pro—
vide evidence of tRFs that are longer than 50 nt, MINTbase can be
trivially augmented to accommodate those as well. Also, integral to
the definition of tRFs is the concomitant tRNA space. MINTbase
makes use of our previously introduced definition of tRNA space
(Telonis et al., 2015 ), which is the union of the nuclear and mito—
chondrial genomic loci that harbor tRNA genes plus the exact mito—
chondrial tRNA—lookalikes that are present in the nuclear genome
and which we reported in (Telonis et al., 2014).

The MINTbase framework adopts a ‘tRF—centric’ approach to
knowledge retrieval and exploratory access to the five types of mol—
ecules shown in (Fig. 1): 5’—tRFs, i—tRFs, 3’—tRFs, 5’—halves and 3’—
halves. Under the hood, MINTbase integrates four kinds of informa-
tion about these molecules:

1. Sequence information: this captures attributes of the molecule
such as the corresponding sequence of nucleotides and the length
of the sequence.

2. Expression information: this captures expression details such as
the tissue type in which the tRF was reported expressed, the dis—
ease type, if applicable, PubMed identiﬁer of the respective pub—
lication(s), unique identiﬁer of the primary dataset, normalized
expression in RPM (Reads Per Million), etc.

3. Parental tRNA (source) information: this captures knowledge
about the fragment in relation to the mature tRNA from which
it can arise, including the parent’s anticodon identity, the frag—
ment’s structural type, the fragment’s starting position relative
to the start of the parental tRNA, the fragment’s placement with
respect to the D, T or anticodon loops of the parental tRNA, etc.
On occasion, the parental tRNA cannot be determined unam—
biguously: in such cases, information about all possible parental
tRNAs is included in MINTbase and reported to the user.

4. Genomic information: this captures global information about
the fragment, including anticodon identity, chromosome and
strand, genomic coordinates, etc.

A MINTbase user can access the available data from five distinct
vantage points or ‘vistas’. The ‘Genomic Loci’ vista provides access
to all possible genomic origins of the sought tRFs and their charac—
teristics with reference to the source tRNA genes. The ‘RNA
Molecule’ vista provides access to the distribution of a tRF across all
tRNAs in the tRNA space. The ‘tRNA Alignment’ vista visualizes
the tRF(s) in the sequence context of the parental tRNA. The
‘Expression’ vista provides information about the different datasets,
tissues, diseases, etc. in which each tRF has been reported expressed,
together with the corresponding PubMed identifier. Finally, the ‘tRF
Summary’ vista summarizes all the information in MINTbase for
each tRF individually in the form of a ‘record.’

Each vista can be accessed independently, and provides the user
with a plethora of sorting options for reorganizing and further sub—
selecting among the reported entries. Output data are presented as
tables (‘genomic loci,’ ‘RNA molecule’ and ‘expression’ vistas), as a
schematic (‘alignment’ vista), or in the form of records (‘summary’
vista) and include links that enable further exploration of the output
at hand from the other vistas.

2.1 Searching MlNTbase

To retrieve information from MINTbase the user is required to
choose a vista, which decides the nature of the reported information
and the organization of the output, and a genome assembly. The use
of filters helps narrow the outcome to a specific subset of the tRF
universe, if the user so desires: e.g. the user can ask to retrieve only
the 5’—tRFs of all anticodons, only the 5’—tRFs of the AlaAGC or
SerACT anticodons, all tRF types that originate from all the gen-
omic instances of ValTAC, etc., or various combinations of such
choices (Fig. 2). To ensure the effortless use of MINTbase, we
accommodated multiple tRNA naming schemes and thus allow the
use of different tRNA identifiers when composing a search. On—
demand pop—up windows as well as help pages provide information
at all stages of one’s interaction with MINTbase.

A novel key feature of MINTbase is that it provides the user
with the ability to enumerate tRFs that have not been reported as
yet in the literature as expressed. Since the tRNA sequence space of
a genome is finite (Telonis et al., 2015 ), there exists an upper bound
to the number of distinct tRF sequences that can ever be produced
by mature tRNAs. The decision to incorporate all possible tRFs
(and not only the ones that have been reported as expressed to date)
stems from our previously reported findings that the tRF profiles in
a given cell/tissue depend on multiple variables (Telonis et al.,
2015). As the number of discovered dependencies is likely to in—
crease it is reasonable to expect that at least some of these currently
unreported tRFs will be discovered by subsequent studies to be ex—
pressed in some setting.

Fig. 2. Search form of MlNTbase. The user can select one of the five possible vistas then impose specific search criteria through specific selections and the avail-
able filters. The user can optionally work with only tRFs for which there is evidence of expression in the literature or with all tRFs that can potentially arise from a
mature tRNA. Filters can include one or more of the structural types of a fragment, amino acid and anticodon, tRNA name, tRF nucleotide sequence, tRF name,

chromosome, strand, etc

2.2 Interpreting a user’s request

Depending on the choice of vista, MINTbase will interpret the
search parameters accordingly. As mentioned above and discussed
in detail in (Telonis et al., 2015 ), there exist tRFs whose sequence is
such that their parental anticodon gene cannot be determined unam—
biguously: imagine, e.g. that the user searches for all ‘5’—tRFs of the
nuclearly encoded AlaAGC anticodon,’ which is denoted by
AlaAGC (n) in MINTbase. It turns out that some of the 5’—tRFs of
AlaAGC are also identically present in isodecoders for AlaCGC,
AlaTGC, CysGCA and ValAAC. Consequently, when the user se—
lects ‘RNA Molecule’, ‘Summary’ or the ‘Expression’ vista,
MINTbase’s output will include information about this ambiguity,
explicitly indicating those 5’—tRFs that exist in AlaAGC and in other
anticodons. In other words, at all points of the user’s interaction
with MINTbase, the user is reminded of the underlying ambiguity
that is inherent to the biology of tRNAs and tRFs.

In the ‘Genomic Loci’ vista, if a user selects a specific anticodon,
MINTbase’s output will not include the 5’—tRFs that have an identi—
cal nucleotide sequence but come from the isodecoder of a different
anticodon: nonetheless, information about the inherent ambiguity
will still be available and reported in a separate column of the out—
put. In the ‘tRNA Alignment’ vista, the selection of a specific tRNA
becomes mandatory and therefore a tRNA gene must be chosen.
Finally, in the case of the ‘tRF Summary’ vista, the user is required
to input a tRF, by providing its sequence (or its label).

2.3 Vista: genomic loci

This is the most detailed vista of the framework and provides a gen—
ome—wide overview of the available information (Fig. 3). Given the
source ambiguity of some tRFs, in the general case, this vista’s output
can comprise multiple rows that refer to all of the genomic instances of
the same tRF sequence. Each of the optional search filters (Search by
tRNA label, Search by fragment sequence, Search by fragment label) is
applied at the genome level and allows the user to further sub—select
among the currently reported results. The Genomic Loci vista is meant
for those users who want to explore similarities among tRFs at the gen—
ome level or to study in detail the tRFs’ relative position with respect to
the source tRNAs. The data are presented in a tabular format that con—
tains one genomic instance per row.

By default several features are reported for each tRF, including
the tRF’s structural type, the tRF’s genome-centric and sequence-
centric labels (see Subsection 2.9 for more information), the actual
nucleotide sequence of the tRF, the identity of the corresponding
amino acid and anticodon, chromosome and strand information,
global genomic starting and ending coordinate, local starting and

ending coordinates within the corresponding mature tRNA, the
number of distinct anticodons that contain the tRF, the number of
instances the tRF has among nuclear and mitochondrial tRNAs re—
spectively, the number of instances the tRF has among the tRNA-
lookalikes in the nuclear genome (Telonis et al. 2014), whether the
tRF overlaps with the D—loop, whether it overlaps with the anti—
codon, etc. The user can selectively report any combination of add—
itional tRF features, e.g. the global genomic coordinates of intronic
endpoints (exon—exon junction spanning tRFs only), etc.

Several of the included features/columns are meant to remind the
user of the idiosyncrasies of the tRNA sequence space, and in par—
ticular the parental tRNA ambiguity that characterizes many tRFs.
Importantly, one of the included features pertains to whether the
tRF’s sequence can also be found outside of the tRNA space: in such
cases, the corresponding tRF should be treated with caution as it
may be a potential false positive (i.e. a non—tRF).

The Genomic Loci vista is interconnected with all the other vistas
allowing the fast exploration of different attributes of the currently ‘ac—
tive list of results.’ For example, by clicking on the sequence of a tRF
contained in the current output the user can open the ‘tRF Summary’
vista for this fragment. By clicking on the entry of the expression col—
umn, if labeled ‘yes,’ the user can retrieve information about the studies
that reported the fragment as expressed whereas by clicking on the
tRNA alignment column’s images the user can retrieve the alignment of
the tRF with respect to its source tRNA.

2.4 Vista: RNA molecule
This vista is molecule—centric and presents a summary of the frag—
ment’s basic characteristics (Fig. 4). The RNA Molecule vista is
meant for those users who want to obtain basic level information of
the tRF of interest and its potential origins in a summarized format.

In this vista, the data is presented in a tabular format with each
row containing a unique tRF sequence. Reported features include
the actual nucleotide sequence of the tRF, the structural type of the
tRF and the amino acid/anticodon combination corresponding to
the parental tRNA gene, the total number of genomic instances that
the tRF has in tRNA space, whether it is also present outside tRNA
space, whether it has been reported as expressed in a tissue, and the
tRF’s ‘license—plate.’ The latter is a unique sequence—centric label
that simplifies referencing and bookkeeping as well as automatically
serves as a lookup table for analyzing RNA—seq data. We discuss it
at length in Subsection 2.9 below.

This vista explicitly captures the inherent ambiguity vis—a—vis a
tRF’s parental tRNA gene, and is an important component of
MINTbase. To this end, MINTbase’s output will group all of the

Fig. 3. Genomic loci vista. The output of this vista presents the user with information about the tRF type, the tRF’s nucleotide sequence, the corresponding amino
acid and anticodon identity, the tRF’s genomic coordinates (global) and the tRF’s coordinates within the parental tRNA (local). Also included is information on
whether a fragment has been reported as expressed in the literature. The results are organized as a table. Menu bars above and below the table enable navigation
in multi-page outputs and also give the user the ability to interact with the presented output: columns can be shown/hidden at will, the number of results shown
per page can be modified and the generated results downloaded. The headers of several columns are interactive and allow the user to sort the corresponding col-

umn’s contents; a second click on a column’s header reverses the sorting order. Holding down the ’shift’ key and clicking on multiple headers, allows for multi-
sorting of the corresponding columns (in the order the headers were selected by the user). The sequence, expression and tRNA alignment columns provide links

to the other four vistas of MlNTbase

Fig. 5. tRNA Alignment vista. The output of this vista presents the user with information on how the tRFs relate to the parental tRNA. A counter at the top of the
page lists the number of tRFs included on the page. The various tRFs are shown aligned to the parental tRNA, one tRF per line. The parental tRNA’s sequence re-

mains floating as the page is scrolled up/down or right/left. tRFs can be selectively removed from the shown alignment (by clicking on the [x] beside them).
Clicking on a fragment’s nucleotide sequence allows the user to transition to the Summary Vista for the corresponding fragment. Clicking on the parental tRNA’s
genome-centric label will redirect the user to the UCSC Genome Browser and enable the user to view the tRNA in its genomic context. Clicking on ’Undo,’ re-
stores the output to its original version. Different colors indicate the location of relevant information such as D-loop, anticodon, T-loop, intron (if appropriate), etc.

A legend at the top of the page describes the used color-coding

amino acid/anticodon combinations that correspond to the same
tRF sequence into a comma—separated list; e.g. see rows 4—6 and row
8 of Fig. 4. Doing so provides the user with a summary view of all
the genomic instances of the tRF at hand and of the tRF’s distribu—
tion across the various amino acids and anticodons. Finally, the vista
is interconnected with and allows a quick transition to the ‘Genomic
Loci’ vista via the ‘number of genomic instances’ column and the
‘tRF Summary’ vista via the fragment sequence. It is also connected
to the ‘Expression’ vista via the expression column.

2.5 Vista: tRNA alignment

This vista is mature—tRNA—centric and presents a summary of the paren—
tal tRNA gene’s repertoire of fragments (Fig. 5). The tRNA Alignment
vista is meant for users who want to explore the tRF—generation poten—
tial of a tRNA across each of the five structural types or simply wish to
visualize the tRF(s) of their choice. For the user—selected mature tRNA,
this display allows the generation of an alignment of all tRFs, or only
the selected ones, against the tRNA, one tRF per line.

The generated output comprises explicit information about the
mature tRNA’s secondary structure: specifically, the D—loop, anti—
codon loop and T—loop are marked with different colors on both the
mature tRNA and the fragments, which facilitates tracking of these
features across the fragments and enables a visual comparison of tRFs
with one another and with the parental gene. Also marked with differ-
ent colors are the anticodon triplet and the non—templated CCA tail.
Individual fragments can be removed at will to allow juxtaposition of
other fragments (e.g. see arrangement of Fig. 5 ); at any time, an al—
ready edited view can be restored to its initial state. Also, the intron of
an intron-containing tRNA can be optionally hidden, an action that
applies to both the shown mature tRNA and the shown fragments.

The links contained in the tRNA Alignment output page allow a
quick transition to the ‘tRF Summary’ vista or a visualization of the par—
ental tRNA’s genomic context via the UCSC Human Genome browser.

2.6 Vista: expression

This vista is fragment—centric and presents information about a
tRF’s known expression status (Fig. 6). The information is reported
in tabular form. If the search parameters retrieved multiple distinct
tRFs from MINTbase, then the table will comprise as many rows as
the number of tRFs: each row will list the sequence of the tRF and

Fig. 6. Expression vista. The above is an instance of the detailed tRF-centric
layer of this vista. For the user-selected fragment, the user is presented with
information about the tRF’s expression across the MlNTbase datasets in
which it is expressed. Menu bars above and below the table enable naviga-
tion and user-interaction with the presented data. Columns can be hidden at
will, the number of results shown per page can be modified, and the gener-
ated results downloaded. The table’s headers are interactive and allow the
user to sort the columns’ contents. In the above example, only a few of the
many possible columns are shown (’unhidden’)

included in MINTbase and contains the tRF. The information of a
given row includes columns that can be optionally hidden and in—
clude: the tRF’s normalized abundance (in RPM), the PubMed iden—
tifier of the primary publication that released the dataset to the
public domain, the PubMed identifier of the publication that ana—

Fig. 7. tRF summary vista. The output of this vista presents basic information about each tRF that is in MlNTbase. It includes the tRF's license plate (the unique se-
quence-centric identifier introduced by MlNTbase—see text), a list of genome-centric labels as discussed in the text, the number of the tRF's genomic instances,
its structural type, whether the tRF appears only inside the tRNA space, a list of all possible parental tRNAs with the tRF underlined in each and the number of

datasets currently in MlNTbase in which the tRF is expressed

expressed, a link to the public domain repository in which the ori-
ginal dataset can be found, a brief description of the dataset as
found in this public repository, etc. The PubMed identifiers, the
dataset identifier, the names of the submitter and corresponding au—
thors, and the names of the corresponding institutions redirect the
user to the NIH PubMed website, the public repository where the
data is deposited, and the personal and institutional webpages
respectively.

MINTbase is meant to serve as a repository for tRFs across vari—
ous tissues and cell types. With that in mind, we also provide an
automated mechanism that allows users to submit their datasets to
MINTbase (described below). This should help MINTbase grow
quickly. In the meantime, we have pre—populated MINTbase with
expressed tRFs from 832 deep—sequencing datasets that include: (i)
the dataset reported in one of the first studies to describe tRFs using
next generation sequencing (Cole et al., 2009); (ii) the dataset from
the study of (Honda et al., 2015 ); (iii) 28 datasets from the study of
(Selitsky et al., 2015 )—tRFs are listed in Supplementary Table 1;
and (iv) the 802 datasets that were analyzed in (Telonis et al., 2015 )
and which were deposited in the public domain as part of three ear—
lier studies (Lappalainen et al., 2013; Pillai et al., 2014; The Cancer
Genome Atlas Network, 2012).

2.7 Vista: tRF summary
This vista provides a tRF—specific record page that summarizes basic
information about the tRF (Fig. 7). This serves not only as a

reference for each molecule but also as a starting point for exploring
the genomic and molecular characteristics of a tRF (e.g. its type, the
potential tRNA gene sources, the number of instances in tRNA
space, etc.) across the available vistas. The power of this vista also
lies on the fact that a tRF’s record lists the number of public datasets
in which the tRF is found expressed.

2.8 Filtering, sorting, downloading and printing

All five vistas were implemented in a way that offers easy naviga—
tion, selection of the maximum number of rows listed per page, se—
lection of the type of features included in each row (some vistas),
and the sorting of the presented information based on the contents
of one or more columns that the user can select on—the—fly.
Furthermore, the active list of results can be sub—selected based on
user—selected values for a variety of attributes (all vistas). Criteria
that the user can impose on the reported output include one or more
of: chromosome identifier, strand, window of genomic coordinates,
structural type of a tRF, amino acid, anticodon, fragment sequence,
fragment name, etc. Multiple user—selected filters are combined
using a Boolean AND operation. Such combinations of conjunctive
filters can help the user ‘zoom in’ on tRFs that exhibit characteristics
of interest, which can then be explored further by transitioning to
one of the other vistas. The user can download the list of active re—
sults (Genomic Loci, RNA Molecule and Expression vistas), print
an alignment (tRNA Alignment vista), or print a tRF record (tRF
Summary vista) as needed.

2.9 Sequence—centric tRF—license plates

In Telonis et al. (2015 ), we introduced a genome—centric labeling
scheme. This scheme, which is also used in MINTbase, comprises
two components separated by the ‘@’ symbol. The first component
is the tRNA name listed in gtRNAdb (Chan and Lowe, 2009). The
second component consists of the tRF’s starting position, its ending
position, its length, the number of distinct anticodons and the num—
ber of instances within tRNA space.

Considering that a given tRF can appear in different isodecoders
of the same anticodon, in different anticodons, or, in the mature
tRNAs of different organisms (Telonis et al., 2015) we wanted to
also acknowledge and emphasize this ‘motif—like,’ i.e. recurrent, char-
acter exhibited by some tRFs. To this end, we designed a labeling
scheme that is decoupled from the genomic location of a tRF, and,
thus, independent of any given genome assembly, a design approach
that meshes well with the tRF—centric character of MINTbase.
Equally importantly, this new scheme enables any user to employ our
provided codes to generate a unique label for their tRF(s) of interest
without requiring a brokering framework such as the one currently
employed by, e.g. miRBase (Kozomara and Griffiths-Jones, 2011).
We emphasize that use of these codes is optional. Nonetheless, the
codes provide users with the ability to generate a unique label that
can be used as a short—hand in a manuscript, to look—up entries in
MINTbase, to compare one’s data with data reported by other re—
search groups, etc. Any tRF sequence can be mapped to a single and
unique label (the tRF’s ‘license plate’), and any license plate can be
mapped back always to the same tRF sequence. Different researchers
who independently discover the same tRF in different contexts will
independently assign the same label to this common tRF. We stress
that assigning a label to a tRF can be done without the requirement
of a central brokering system—as long as researchers use the pro—
vided codes, the resulting tRF labels will remain consistent. It is our
hope that this scheme will help speed up tRF research. Importantly,
allowing researchers at different institutions to generate the same un—
ambiguous and unique label for the same tRF sequence should facili—
tate comparisons of a given tRF’s behavior in different tissues, under
different conditions, across different publications, etc.

The labeling system is essentially a remapping of a tRF’s nucleo—
tide sequence from a base—4 system (A, C, G, T) to a base—32 system
that uses the following alphanumeric symbols: B, D, 0, E, F, 1, H, I,
2, J, K, 3, L, M, 4, N, O, 5, P, Q, 6, R, S, 7, U, V, 8, W, X, 9, Y, Z.
By symmetrically interweaving letters and numbers, the resulting
tRF label resembles an automobile’s license plate. Note that the new
encoding does not use any of A, C, G or T; this is intentional and en-
sures that the tRF license plates do not contain any of the letters
found in the tRF’s DNA sequence.

Let us use the i—tRF CTGTCACGCGGGAGACCGGGGTT from
AspGTC to demonstrate this mapping scheme. First, we segment the
tRF into consecutive, non—overlapping 5—mers; for tRFs whose
length is not a multiple of 5, the last tuple will be between 1 and 4 nt
long. The above tRF will give us CTGTC|ACGCG|GGAGA|
CCGGG|GTT. We map each 5—mer to a pair of symbols from the
above alphabet using standard base—32 mapping; this will result in
the following four pairs: NM|EH|62|3K. The leftover suffix string
can have four instances of length 1, 16 instances of length 2, 64 in-
stances of length 3 and 256 instances of length 4: we sort these 340
base—4 strings in lexicographic order and map the first 32 to symbols
B through Z (see above list) and the remaining 308 to pairs DB
through  In our example, the trailing GTT will map to 0E. To
avoid mistaking symbol pairs representing a leftover suffix from
symbol pairs representing 5—mers, we include the length of the ori—
ginal tRF in the license plate: using this information we can

unambiguously decode a tRF—license plate back into the original nu-
cleotide sequence. To conclude, under this new mapping scheme,
the tRF CTGTCACGCGGGAGACCGGGGTT will be encoded by
the license plate ‘tRF—23—NMEH623KOE.’ The scripts needed to
generate a tRF—license plate for a tRF and to decode a tRF—license
plate are available at http://cm.jefferson.edu/MINTcodes/.

2.10 MlNTsubmit: submit your entries to MlNTbase

We designed MINTbase to be a dynamic repository of information
pertaining to tRFs. Considering that the ready availability of deep
sequencing data will make it simpler for increasing numbers of
groups to generate tRF information, MINTbase also provides a con—
duit for the automated deposition of new tRF expression records. A
user interaction with MINTsubmit begins at https://cm.jefferson.
edu/MINTsubmit/. The system will subsequently send a verification
code to the user—provided email address. The user will then proceed
by entering the verification code together with other relevant infor-
mation that pertains to the sample. In order to ensure fairness of ac—
cess to the service, users will only be able to submit datasets that are
already deposited in a public repository such as NIH’s Gene
Expression Omnibus (GEO) and have been described in an article
that is already listed on PubMed (and, thus, has a PubMed identi—
fier). As soon as the provided information has been verified, the
user’s submitted dataset will continue its progress through the auto—
mated pipeline that will incorporate it into MINTbase and make it
publicly available.

2.11 Various

MINTbase’s knowledge repository is organized as a MySQL data—
base. Users access the database via a web application, which is writ-
ten in Java. Every time the search form is submitted or the tables are
sorted, a new request is submitted to the application. Each request is
handled separately and the results are kept around for 2 h to help ac—
celerate subsequent downloading and page—viewing requests.

The secondary structures for the nuclearly—encoded tRNAs that
are highlighted in the ‘tRNA alignment’ vista were obtained from
http://gtrnadb2009.ucsc.edu/Hsapi19/Hsapi19—structs.html (Chan
and Lowe, 2009). The secondary structures for the mitochondrially-
encoded tRNAs were obtained from mitotRNAdb (Juhling et al.,
2009). The secondary structure of the eight exact tRNA—lookalikes
(Telonis et al., 2014) was borrowed from and mirrors that of their
mitochondrial tRNA counterparts.

3 Discussion

We presented MINTbase, a novel framework for studying fragments
that arise from mitochondrial and nuclear mature tRNAs.
MINTbase is an easy—to—use resource for accessing information on
tRFs and interactively studying them from diverse vantage points
using one or more of the five available vistas. Each vista provides
distinct functionalities and its output is interconnected to some of
the other four vistas, which in turn enables exploration of the active
results from multiple angles at any time. The output pages provide
filtering and sorting capabilities thereby permitting an interactive
study and further filtering of the active results by the user. For ex—
ample, the user can easily group the results to investigate possible
connections to a type of tRF, a specific source tRNA, number of in-
stances in tRNA space, etc. Additionally, several output pages also
include links to external databases (e.g. the UCSC Genome Browser,
PubMed, etc.) aimed at providing the user with other easily access—
ible information.

MlNTbase: a framework for the interactive exploration of mitochondrial and nuclear tRNA fragments 2489

 

MINTbase offers several advantages. First, it addresses the need
for a database that includes the most recent discoveries in the field
of tRFs and tRNA biology. The discoveries of the new structural
type of i—tRFs, of tRFs produced from mitochondrial tRNAs and of
SHOT—RNAs, represent recent advances that are already part of
MINTbase’s knowledge repository.

Second, three of the five vistas that MINTbase makes available are
meant to capture and highlight the inherent complexity of the space of
mature tRNAs while illustrating at the same time the ambiguity among
parental tRNA genes: the ‘Genomic Loci’ vista provides a detailed per—
spective on the possible genomic origins of a tRF whereas the ‘RNA
Molecule’ and ‘tRF Summary’ vistas summarize the distribution of
each tRF molecule across the various anticodons/isodecoders from
which it could arise. Thereby, MINTbase allows the user to retrieve in—
formation in multiple ways while also keeping at the forefront the com—
plexity of the tRNA space throughout the user’s interactive session.

Third, MINTbase has been built to incorporate the spectrum of
all possible tRFs (currently up to 50 nt in length—longer tRFs can be
accommodated trivially) that can ever arise from a mature tRNA,
whether it is mitochondrially or nuclearly encoded. Our intent was
to design a tool that can further promote research activities in the
field of tRFs. Thus, in addition to listing molecules with known ex—
pression, MINTbase can optionally provide detailed information on
fragments that could potentially derive from mature tRNAs and for
which no information exists yet in the public domain. Such candi—
date tRFs can serve as the subject of focused experimental studies by
MINTbase’s users.

Lastly, MINTbase permits users to add their own datasets to the
repository. This is done easily through the use of a submission con—
duit that we also provide. Save a mandatory manual verification of
the provided information the process is entirely automated.

In summary, we hope MINTbase will prove a useful framework
for researchers who study tRNAs and tRFs by providing quick ac—
cess to the available knowledge, by juxtaposing relevant information
in order to enable comparative analyses, by adopting and using both
genome—centric and sequence—centric labeling schemes and by ena—
bling web—based exploratory studies through its user—friendly,
tRNA—centric interface.

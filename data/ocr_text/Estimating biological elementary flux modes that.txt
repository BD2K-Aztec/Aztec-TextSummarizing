ABSTRACT

Motivation: Elementary flux mode (EFM) is a useful tool in constraint-
based modeling of metabolic networks. The property that every flux
distribution can be decomposed as a weighted sum of EFMs allows
certain applications of EFMs to studying flux distributions. The exist-
ence of biologically infeasible EFMs and the non-uniqueness of the
decomposition, however, undermine the applicability of such meth-
ods. Efforts have been made to find biologically feasible EFMs by
incorporating information from transcriptional regulation and thermo-
dynamics. Yet, no attempt has been made to distinguish biologically
feasible EFMs by considering their graphical properties. A previous
study on the transcriptional regulation of metabolic genes found that
distinct branches at a branch point metabolite usually belong to
distinct metabolic pathways. This suggests an intuitive property of
biologically feasible EFMs, i.e. minimal branching.

Results: We developed the concept of minimal branching EFM and
derived the minimal branching decomposition (MBD) to decompose
flux distributions. Testing in the core Escherichia coli metabolic net-
work indicated that MBD can distinguish branches at branch points
and greatly reduced the solution space in which the decomposition is
often unique. An experimental flux distribution from a previous study
on mouse cardiomyocyte was decomposed using MBD. Comparison
with decomposition by a minimum number of EFMs showed that MBD
found EFMs more consistent with established biological knowledge,
which facilitates interpretation. Comparison of the methods applied to
a complex flux distribution in Lactococcus lactis similarly showed the
advantages of MBD. The minimal branching EFM concept underlying
MBD should be useful in other applications.

1 INTRODUCTION

Metabolic networks consisting of biochemical reactions and
compounds in a cell have proven to be an extremely useful in
silico tool to study cellular metabolism (Edwards and Palsson,
1999; Oberhardt et al., 2009; Price et al., 2004). The structure of a
metabolic network is reﬂected in the stoichiometric matrix S, and
the state of the network is embodied in the ﬂux distribution (FD)

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

V, which is a vector containing all reaction rates in the network.
Based on the well-established quasi-steady-state assumption, V
can be constrained in a polyhedral cone (Sv = 0, vub Z V Z vlb)
and studied using a series of so-called constraint-based recon-
struction and analysis (COBRA) methods (Lewis et al., 2012).

One of the approaches of theoretical importance and applica-
tion value is the elementary flux mode (EFM) analysis (Schuster
and Hilgetag, 1994). An EFM is a FD with a minimal number of
active reactions that together satisfy the steady-state condition.
It is thus a minimal metabolic pathway in a metabolic network.
EFMs have been successfully applied to examine network struc-
tures, explore new metabolic pathways, suggest rational strain de-
sign, etc. (reviewed in Trinh et al., 2009; Zanghellini et al., 2013).

Another property of EFMs useful for studying FDs is that
every FD v is a non-negative sum of EFMs:

K
v=Zozkek 
k=1

where e1 - - - eK are all EFMs of the network, and oak is the cor-
responding weight coefﬁcient. This decomposition of FDs from
EFMs or extreme pathways (another type of pathways with a
similar definition) has been investigated and applied to certain
biological studies by choosing particular decompositions [re-
viewed in Chan and Ji (2011)]. The usefulness of these methods,
however, is limited for two main reasons. First, the practical
computation of the decomposition requires the set of all EFMs
a priori, which is usually not available in large-scale networks
owing to combinatorial explosion. This computational issue can
be overcome in two ways, either by sampling EFMs (Machado
et al., 2012; Tabe-Bordbar and Marashi, 2013) or by finding
EFMs with particular properties to solve for the decomposition
without requiring the entire set of EFMs (Chan and Ji, 2011; de
Figueiredo et al., 2009; Ip et al., 2011; Fey and Planes, 2014;
Rezola et al., 2011). The second limitation is the non-uniqueness
of decomposition and its dependence on the choice of algorithms
or optimization objective (Zanghellini et al., 2013). The ambigu-
ity severely weakens the biological signiﬁcance of decomposition.
Poolman et al. (2004) has proposed a method to obtain unique
decompositions by combining EFMs with variable weights into
compound modes with unique weights. Another method
for unique decompositions is the minimization of the sum of
squares of weights (Schwartz and Kanehisa, 2005, 2006), but
the resulting decomposition can be dependent on how EFMs
are scaled.

The usefulness of EFMS can be enhanced by ﬁnding biologic-
ally feasible EFMs. Attempts have been made to incorporate
transcriptional regulatory information to enumerate biologically
feasible EFMS (Jungreuthmayer et al., 2013) and to rule out
thermodynamically infeasible EFMS (J 01 et al., 2012). These
approaches integrating information other than stoichiometry
did give promising results. The information, for instance, meta-
bolomics data and transcriptomics data, however, is not always
available. Surprisingly, all the proposed methods to ﬁnd EFMS or
to choose decomposition have not made full use of their graphical
properties, which should be intuitively important for interpreting
EFMS. An earlier study on the co-regulation of metabolic path-
ways found that transcriptional regulation tends to favor linear
metabolic ﬂow by co-expressing only distinct branches at meta-
bolic branch points (Ihmels et al., 2004). This means, in Figure 1
where ‘A’ is a hypothetical branch point metabolite, the genes for
the linear pair of reactions ‘R1’ and ‘R3’, or the pair ‘R2’ and ‘R4’,
are more likely to be co-expressed than ‘R3’, ‘R4’ and ‘RS’, which
are distinct branches. When decomposing a FD containing ‘Rl’
to ‘R4’, two EFMS containing pair ‘R1 ’and ‘R3’ and pair ‘R2’ and
‘R4’ are thus a more preferable choice than one EFM containing
all ‘Rl’ to ‘R4’, as there are probably two distinct pathways. This
suggests the rationale of minimizing branching pathways to
choose EFMS that are more likely to be biologically feasible.
This rationale is also expected to allow clearer interpretation of
the roles of the chosen EFMS because they are expected to contain
fewer distinct pathways. We believed that such EFMS can have
wide applicability. As the ﬁrst attempt based on this rationale, in
this article, a new optimization objective called minimal branch-
ing decomposition (MBD) is proposed to identify more biologic-
ally relevant EFMs to decompose FDs using stoichiometric
information alone.

2 METHODS

2.1 Optimization objective

The goal is to derive an optimization objective for ﬁnding 0:1 - - -01K
to compute an MBD composed of EFMS with as few branching
pathways as possible. Given the set of all EFM contained in the
matrix E=[e1---eK]=[eJ-k] e R"XK and the stoichiometric matrix
S: [Sy] 6 RM” in a metabolic network with m metabolites and n reac-
tions, assume that the FD to be decomposed is v = [vj] e R".

First, deﬁne the consumption matrix C:[C[j] and the production
matrix P = [PU] for metabolites:

{1 a m<0 {1 H m>0
if: if:

, P . (2)
0 ﬁ.%:0 0 d.%:0

In other words, if Ci]- : 1, then metabolite i is consumed by reaction j,
and if Pi]- = 1, then metabolite i is produced by reaction j. Based on C and
P, compute the number of paths NP: [NPik] e RMXK passing through
metabolite i in EFM k:

NPl'k : <    
j=1 "=1

where 6]- = 1 if eJ-k 75 0 and 6]- = 0 if 61-], = 0. NP”C is in fact the number of
reactions consuming metabolite i multiplied by the number of reactions
producing metabolite i in EFM k. It is thus the number of locally differ-
ent paths passing through metabolite 1'. Figure 1 illustrates an example.
NP is used for distinguishing EFMS that deviate from linear ﬂow through
branch point metabolites. Perfectly linear EFMS would have N Pik = 1 for
all metabolites, and EFMS with more branching ﬂow would have higher
NPik. The minimum use of EFMs with high NPik therefore deﬁnes the
optimization objective to obtain an MBD. Hence, the objective coefﬁcient
ck for EFM k is expressed as the following sum:

Ck Z Z WiN P ik (4)
i=1

where w,- is the weight for metabolite i. It is manually assigned to account
for the relative importance of a metabolite as a branch point metabolite.
The simplest way for assigning weights to metabolites is to just assign l
for all weights meaning that there is no bias toward the branching of any
metabolite in an EFM. In practice, biological knowledge is required to
choose suitable weights to obtain better decomposition. For example, for
pyruvate, which is a true branch point metabolite involved in different
metabolic pathways, a decomposition by EFMS with different fates of
pyruvate, for instance, one going into the anaerobic fermentation and the
other going into the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle, is preferred to a
decomposition by all EFMS involving both the fermentation and the
tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) cycle. In this case, branching of pyruvate
within an EFM is strongly undesired so the weight can be set to be much
higher than 1. In contrast, cofactors like ATP/ADP are global cellular
currencies, and their distinct linear ﬂow may not be biologically relevant.
Low or zero weights can be assigned to them. The weighting also depends
on the particular purpose of application. For example, if one focuses on
comparing the glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway, a high
weight can then be assigned to glucose 6-phosphate, which is a branch
point of the two pathways.

2.2 Minimal branching decomposition

Having derived the objective, an MBD can be obtained by solving the
following mixed integer linear programming problem (MILP):

K m
min 2 Z wiNPikﬁk (5)
k=1i=1
K
subject to Zejkozk=vj for j=l,...,N (6)
k=1
Ogakgﬁkfor k=l,...,K (7)
,Bke{0,l}for k=l,...,K (8)

Objective (5) minimizes the use of EFMS with higher numbers of non-
linear pathways being active at branch point metabolites. Equation (6) is
the constraint for decomposition. Constraint (7) is the on/off switch for
an EFM. If ,Bk = 0, EFM k is switched off. If ,Bk = l, EFM k is switched
on. In the problem stated here, two assumptions without loss of gener-
ality are made on the EFM matrix E:[ejk] for simpler presentation.
First, E is calculated from a stoichiometric matrix consisting of

irreversible reactions only. It can be achieved by dividing each reversible
reaction into two irreversible reactions with stoichiometry negative to
each other. This avoids negative ﬂuxes and additional constraints on
reversible EFMS. Second, all EFMS are assumed to be scaled to have
maximum weights not greater than 1 (oak 5 1). One way for scaling is to
multiply each ek by rk= minj{Vj/ejklejk>0}. Another method used in
Wiback et al. (2003) is scaling to an uptake reaction by multiplying
eaCh ek  r k : Vuptake/euptakeJc-

It is noted that the ‘no cancellation’ property of decomposition by
EFMs (Llaneras and Pico, 2010) ensures that if for a reaction j, vj=0,
then all EFMS with eJ-k 75 0 must have oak = 0. It facilitates optimization
by ﬁrst selecting EFMS able to have non-zero weights for a FD, called
‘contributable EFMs’ and deﬁned by ECONTR1= {eklejk=0 if vj=0},
out of E, which is usually intractable for larger networks (Klamt and
Stelling, 2002; Trinh et al., 2009).

2.3 Enumeration of alternative optima

One of the major drawbacks of interpreting decomposition by EFMs is
the non-uniqueness. Despite the use of certain optimization objectives, for
instance, a minimum number of EFMS as in Wiback et al. (2003), the
number of alternative optimal solutions can still be large. The perform-
ance of MBD regarding the uniqueness of decomposition was examined
by enumerating alternative optima. The R-th alternative optimal MBD
was calculated by adding the following constraint to the model:

K K
Zﬁiﬁks<2c,:)—i for r=l,...,R—l (9)
k=1 k=1

where b, =[,Br1 13%] is the binary integer solution of the r-th alter-
native optimal MBD found. Suboptimal solutions can also be found.

2.4 Other decompositions for comparison
MBD was compared with decomposition by a minimum number of
EFMS (MinEFMD) and random decomposition (RD). MinEFMD was
calculated by replacing equation (5) with ck = l for all k. RD was sampled
as follows:
Initialization: D = {}.

Step 1: ﬁnd contributable EFMS ECONTRI= {ekleJ-k = 0 if V]: 0}.

Step 2: randomly choose an ek from ECONTRI. D <— D U {ck}.

Step 3: v <— v — rek where r= minj{vj/ejk|ejk>0}

Step 4: if v=0, terminate and D is a decomposition. Else, go to
step 1.

2.5 Implementations

EFMS were calculated using efmtool (Terzer and Stelling, 2008), and
optimization models were solved by Gurobi 5 .5® via the COBRA toolbox
in MATLAB® in which all other calculations were performed.
The MATLAB script ﬁle is available in the Supplementary Material.
The desktop computer used had a 3.1GHz quad-core CPU and 16 GB
of RAM.

3 RESULTS

MBD was tested on randomly sampled FDs in the
core Escherichia coli metabolic network as a validation of the
method (Orth et al., 2010). It was then applied to a FD deter-
mined by isotopomer distributions reported previously for the
cardiomyocyte in perfused mouse heart (V0 and Palsson, 2006)
and to a FD estimated from a dataset of metabolite assimilation
and excretion in the recently published genome-scale metabolic
network of Lactococcus lactis (Flahaut et al., 2013). In the latter
two cases, FDs were not sampled because they were estimated
from experimental data.

3.1 Core E.coli metabolic network

The core E.coli metabolic network (Orth et al., 2010) with 95
reactions and 72 metabolites simpliﬁed from the iAF1260
genome-scale network of E.coli (Feist et al., 2007) includes gly-
colysis, TCA cycle, oxidative phosphorylation, pentose phos-
phate pathway and a biomass reaction, alongside with a set of
transcriptional regulatory rules that can be readily implemented.
Three different tests were performed to examine (i) the ability to
separate ﬂuxes at branch point metabolites; (ii) the performance
in a simulated case consistent with regulatory rules and (iii) the
issue of multiple optimal decompositions. As the set of all pos-
sible FDs has inﬁnitely many solutions, random sampling based
on the hit-and-run method (Ahnaas et al., 2004) was applied to
sample FDs for the tests. Table 1 summarizes the results. More
details can be found in Supplementary Material.

3.1.1 Separation of ﬂuxes at branch points To check that
the proposed method has the desired ability to choose EFMS
of distinct branches at branch points, two scenarios were

cing and consuming reactions. (c) Test 2: a simulated case of glyoxylate
cycle coupled to acetate uptake implied by regulatory rules

tested (Fig. 2a). First, two of the consuming reactions (C1, C2) of
a branch point were chosen. Two sets of FDs, one with VC175 0,
vcz = 0 and vice versa, were sampled and summed up as the set
of FDs being tested. The second scenario is more difﬁcult in
which metabolites have two producing reactions (P1, P2) indi-
vidually and coupled to CI and C2, respectively (Fig. 2b). FDs
were sampled and summed up as complex FDs for testing. In
both scenarios, FDs were decomposed into EFMS to check
whether the distinct branches were correctly associated in the
chosen EFMS. In this test, the available carbon sources were
set to be fructose and acetate to allow more branch points
while their simultaneous uptake does not conﬂict the given regu-
latory rules. As this test aimed to assess the basic ability of MBD,
the weight w, was set to 1 for the branch point being tested and
0 for the rest of metabolites. A11 metabolites were balanced
during the calculation of EFMS. In all, 19 500 EFMS were
calculated.

There are 11 branch points in the ﬁrst scenario. In each case,
10 FDs were randomly sampled and then subjected to MBD.
In all, 1000 sRDs were obtained for each FD as comparison.
In all cases, no EFMS in an MBD use two consuming reactions
simultaneously, whereas it is true for only 7.5% of the RDs
overall. In scenario 2, six branch points with two or more produ-
cing and consuming reactions were identiﬁed, and 94 combin-
ations were tested. For each combination, 10 FDs for each of the
four producing and consuming pairs were sampled and com-
bined as shown in Figure 2b. MBDs for the resultant FDs
were then calculated. In 94% of the MBDs for near 2000 FDs,
all EFMs involve the correct reaction pairs, whereas only 1%
of the RDs is correct. These results conﬁrmed that the
proposed MBD is capable of separating ﬂuxes at branch point
metabolites.

3.1.2 Coupling ofglyoxylate cycle and acetate uptake The given
regulatory rules of the core E.coli network imply that the glyox-
ylate cycle is active only if acetate is being consumed. Thus, in the
presence of fructose and acetate, the system can consume both
substrates with the glyoxylate cycle used primarily for acetate
metabolism. Similar experiments and results have been reported

in yeast (dos Santos et al., 2003). To test whether MBD can
distinguish the acetate-induced glyoxylate cycle from the TCA
cycle, two sets of FDs were sampled, one without acetate uptake
and glyoxylate cycle activity and the other without fructose
uptake (Fig. 20). One FD from each set was summed to form
a complex FD, which was subject to MBD. w, = 1 for all metab-
olites except the obvious branch point Acetyl—CoA with
w,=1000. MinEFMDs and RDs were also computed for
comparison.

In all 200 FDs tested, no EFMs in any MBDs have simultan-
eous fructose uptake and glyoxylate cycle activity, whereas all
MinEFMDs do. Only 1.5% of MBDs use one EFM cometabo-
1izing fructose and acetate, whereas all MinEFMDs do. For
RDs, >99% have neither properties. This example demonstrated
the unique capability of MBD to distinguish individually
regulated pathways in a realistic system setting with underlying
regulatory rules.

3.1.3 Uniqueness of MBDs To investigate the uniqueness of
MBDs, 2000 FDs with glucose as carbon source were sampled.
Alternative optimal MBDs and MinEFMDs were enumerated.
To obtain a smaller set of EFMS for easier optimization, several
cofactors and small metabolites were unbalanced when calculat-
ing EFMs. It is noted that though EFMS resulting from unba-
lancing cofactors can still properly decompose any FDs, they
cannot reﬂect the subtle interdependence between different
metabolic pathways. More discussion can be found in the
Supplementary Information.

MBD has a satisfactory performance regarding uniqueness.
There are 45% of FDs that have a unique MBD, and 95% of
the FDs have no more than eight multiple MBDs. To compare
the results with MinEFMDs, we randomly picked 20 FDs and
enumerated the alternative MinEFMDs. A11 FDs turned out to
have 21000 different MinEFMDs. As the minimum number of
EFMs required for decomposition is much smaller than the
number of contributable EFMS, e.g. dozens out of hundreds
or thousands, there are virtually countless MinEFMDs. The
number of multiple MBDs is extremely small in this sense. The
results suggested that MBD is effective in identifying a small
subset of decompositions by EFMS with fewer branching path-
ways, which are suitable for understanding the FDs.

3.2 Mouse myocardial metabolic network

To demonstrate that the proposed method indeed yield a more
intuitive and biologically relevant decomposition, MBD was
applied to a FD of mouse cardiomyocyte estimated from isoto-
pomer labeling experiments performed in perfused mouse hearts
(V0 and Palsson, 2006). The model and the FD are available as
the Supplementary Information in that publication. The mouse
myocardial metabolic network consists of 240 metabolites and
257 reactions compartmentalized into cytoplasm, mitochondrion
and extracellular space. There are 99 active reactions in the FD
(Fig. 3). Glucose and oleate (a fatty acid) were available as
carbon sources. Lactate, pyruvate and the ketone bodies acetoa-
cetate and 3-hydroxybutanoate were excreted. A small amount
of citrate and succinate were also produced.

The primary function of cardiomyocyte is energy production
for heart contraction. It is represented by the reaction ‘DMatp’

hydrolyzing ATP in the network. By decomposing the FD into a
set of EFMS, different pathways for energy production and other
cellular activities can be revealed. A11 metabolites were balanced
for EFM calculation. In all, 1236 EFMS were computed.
Optimality could not be proved after 24h in the initial trial to
ﬁnd an MBD using a uniform weight. We then attempted to put
emphasis on the obvious branch point of glucose and fatty acid
oxidation, acetyl-CoA, by giving a weight of 1000 to it and 1 to
other metabolites. An optimal MBD comprising 14 EFMs was
obtained and was proved to be unique. EFMS in the MBD can
be divided into four types. The ﬁrst is three EFMS of fatty acid
oxidation that produce C02 and ketone bodies. The second is
nine EFMs producing C02 and different organic acids from glu-
cose. The third is an EFM consuming glucose and oleate and
producing citrate, ,B-hydroxybutyrate (BHB) and C02. In this
EFM, it is unambiguous that BHB is produced from oleate be-
cause pyruvate dehydrogenase, the only reaction in the FD con-
verting pyruvate into acetyl-CoA, is not included in this EFM,

and acetyl-CoA is the precursor of BHB. The fourth type is an
isolated cycle between citrulline and ornithine. The difference
between EFMS lies in the products and the different cellular
activities or pathways, including the malate—aspartate shuttle,
pseudoketogenesis and an apparent glutamate—glutamine futile
cycle.

We examined whether ﬁnding decomposition after removing
EFMS with simultaneous oleate and glucose uptake is possible.
No solution could be found, showing that at least one such EFM
is required in any decomposition. To see whether this necessary
interdependence of glucose and fatty acid oxidation originated
from the balance of cofactors, we tried to ﬁnd MBDs using sets
of EFMS calculated from unbalancing some cofactors and small
metabolites. When unbalancing NAD+ and NADH, an MBD
without any EFM using both carbon sources simultaneously was
found, whereas unbalancing other metabolites such as ATP,
ADP, H+ or Pi did not give the desired result. This suggested
that glucose and fatty acid oxidation interacted to have a
balanced use of NADH/NAD+. This kind of comparison be-
tween MBDs obtained from balanced and partially balanced
EFMs can provide insights into the interdependence of
pathways.

For comparison, MinEFMDs and RDs were computed.
There were 35 optimal MinEFMDs, each with 13 EFMs. To
have a fair comparison, nine suboptimal MBDs were enumer-
ated. Comparing the three types of decomposition can distin-
guish several properties of an MBD (Table 2). First, only one
EFM in each MBD consumes glucose and oleate simultaneously.
As one is hexose and the other is fatty acid, their uses lie in
different pathways, and thus, a good decomposition should
avoid using EFMS consuming both. In all MinEFMDs, however,
at least ﬁve such EFMS were used.

Second, most EFMS in the MBDs excrete at most one organic
acid or ketone body except two EFMS that excrete two, whereas
all MinEFMDs use several EFMS producing three or four prod-
ucts simultaneously. Such decompositions are more difﬁcult to
interpret because the sole effect of producing a certain compound
alone (e.g. role in ATP production) might not be observed by
looking at individual EFMs. EFMS excreting more metabolites
are also expectably longer, which might be more difﬁcult to visu-
alize. Another relevant advantage of MBD is that because an
MBD would in general use EFMS that produce as few com-
pounds as possible, if coproduction is observed in an EFM in
an MBD solution, it may suggest the possibility that the

Decomposition by minimal branching elementary flux modes

 

production of the compounds is coupled under the particular
condition where the FD is measured.

Third, the EFMs used in the MBDs appear to be more con-
sistent with the regulation of metabolic pathways. For instance,
ketogenesis by which ketone bodies are produced is known to be
associated with fatty acid oxidation rather than glycolysis.
In MBDs, no EFMs producing ketone bodies from glucose are
present, but 19 of 35 MinEFMDs contain at least one of these
EFMs. Another example is malonyl-CoA (‘malcoa’ in Fig. 3).
Production of malonyl-CoA is a known mechanism leading to
the repression of fatty acid oxidation by glucose by inhibiting
the transfer of fatty acyl moieties into mitochondria in cardiac
muscle (Depre et al., 1999). Use of EFMS that do not couple
fatty acid oxidation and the cycle between malonyl-CoA and
acetyl-CoA is thus a more rational choice. In the MBD, no
EFMS simultaneously use oleate and involve malonyl-CoA
whereas all MinEFMDs do. The same comparison was also per-
formed between MBDs and MinEFMDs obtained from EFMs
unbalancing NAD+ and NADH. All properties still hold
(see Supplementary Material).

From the comparison, MBD is shown to have several proper-
ties of biological relevance that are possessed by only a tiny
portion of MinEFMDs. We argue that the more biologically
relevant decomposition by MBD does not occur by chance but
rather by the minimization of the use of EFMS with branching
pathways. The reasons are 2-fold. First, from the consideration
of the network structure alone, naturally occurring metabolic
pathways tend to prefer linearity to branching at branch point
metabolites as suggested in Ihmels et al. (2004) based on their
observation on data from 21000 experimental conditions.
Second, the ﬂux of a certain reaction is the sum of the ﬂuxes
of different pathways containing that particular reaction. As dif-
ferent pathways have different ﬂuxes, minimizing the use of those
‘hybrid’ EFMS would force the use of EFMS representing the
true pathways to ﬁt the ﬂux values rather than a combination of
‘hybrid’ EFMs, which is also able to ﬁt the values of ﬂuxes with a
similar number of EFMS.

3.3 Lactococcus lactis genome-scale metabolic network

Lactococcus lactis is a model organism in the group of lactic acid
bacteria and has an important role in cheese production.
Lactococcus lactis is in general auxotrophic for several amino
acids (AAs) (Jensen and Hammer, 1993) and grows on complex
media. It also produces compounds involved in ﬂavor formation
(Ayad et al., 1999). From the recently published genome-scale
metabolic network of L.lactis subsp. cremoris MG1363, which
speciﬁes many ﬂavor-forming pathways (Flahaut et al., 2013),
a FD with a complex proﬁle of substrate consumption and pro-
duction can be obtained and can thus test the applicability of
MBD. The FD was simulated by FBA using the measured con-
sumption/production rates of glucose, lactate, formate, acetate,
ethanol and different AAs in a chemostat experiment at dilution
rate 0.05 th as constraints. The subnetwork spanned by the
simulated FD contains 294 metabolites and 280 reactions,
including 26 uptake and 13 excretion reactions. In all, 518
EFMS were computed when balancing all the metabolites.

A unique MBD of 11 EFMS was computed. Nine other sub-
optimal MBDs, 10 MinEFMDs and 104 RDs were obtained for

Length of EFMs

comparison. First, we focused on two properties, the number of
exchange reactions and the length of the EFMS. They can reﬂect
the interpretability and visualizability of the EFMs. Figure 4
shows their distribution in the three types of decompositions.
MBD in general used shorter EFMS with lower numbers of
uptake and excretion reactions, whereas MinEFMD and RD
performed similarly. This indicates that MBD is easier for inter-
pretation and visualization.

Second, we looked into the organization of individual path-
ways. An interesting observation pertains to the fermentation
mode. Lactococcus lactis has been well known for its shift
between homolactic fermentation producing only lactate and
mixed-acid fermentation that produces formate, acetate and
ethanol in addition depending on the glucose uptake rate
(Thomas et al., 1979). The two modes are regulated differently.
The reactions responsible for lactate, formate, acetate and
ethanol production are lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), pyru-
vate-formate lyase (PFL), acetate kinase (ACK) and alcohol
dehydrogenase (ADH), respectively. No MBDs contain EFMs
involving concurrent use of LDH and PFL, ACK or ADH, while
97% of RDs and all but 1 MinEFMDs do.

The L.lactis network also models detailed AA metabolism
including pathways for AA interconversion and tRNA biosyn-
thesis. According to a recently reconstructed transcriptional
regulatory network of L.lactis (Ravcheev et al., 2013) available
in RegPrecise database (Novichkov et al., 2010), they belong to
different regulons and coincide at many metabolites. It is rele-
vant to check how MBD performs regarding these branch points.
In the current MBD, however, the EFM matrix used to calculate
MBD includes the biomass reaction, forcing many pathways to
participate in one EFM to produce biomass. This is also the
reason for the small size of the EFM set.

To cope with this, in a new round of MBD calculation, the
biomass reaction was split into several reactions producing

individual biomass components, including DNA, RNA, pro-
teins, lipid, peptidoglycan, etc. This then resulted in 32 962
EFMS. A weight equal to 1000 was assigned to branch points
in AA metabolism (Table 3) and 1 to other metabolites. Most
branch points are AAs acting as precursors for tRNA, other
biomass components or ﬂavor compounds. Cysteine and serine
as an exception contribute to the pyruvate pool. Other branch
points include 2-oxobutanoate (2OBUT), a precursor for a
ﬂavor compound where the ﬂuxes from threonine and cystathio-
nine meet; ribose 5-phosphate (R5P), synthesized from the
pentose phosphate pathway or the ribose produced from
methionine and phosphoribosyl pyrophosphate (PRPP), synthe-
sized from R5P and used for producing either tryptophan or
NADT.

Convergence to optimality seemed impractical and ﬁve sub-
optimal MBDs were obtained. The best one has an optimality
gap of 22% after 24h of calculation. For MinEFMD, no solu-
tion using less EFMS than RD could be found so only RD was
considered.

Comparing the original MBDs with the current ones, differ-
ences can be observed. First, the present MBDs consist of eight
more EFMs than the original. Second, EFMS are shorter in the
present MBDs. These changes are expectable because smaller
parts of metabolism are sufﬁcient for producing individual bio-
mass components at steady state while more EFMS are required
when each EFM covers a smaller part. We also looked into the
ATP turnover; in the original MBDs, ATP consumption is per-
fectly distributed to growth requirement in ﬁve EFMs and non-
growth—associated maintenance in the other six EFMs. In the
current MBDs, however, only 70% of ATP maintenance is con-
sumed in EFMS independent of synthesis of biomass compo-
nents. This may be the result of suboptimality. Alternatively,
this suggests that simultaneous clear roles in both ATP consump-
tion and AA branch points are impossible. However, as an

advantage of the current MBDs, the ATP consumption by
synthesizing each biomass components can be reﬂected. tRNA
and nucleotide synthesis consume >80% of the ATP.

Regarding AA branch points, MBD successfully chose separ-
ate EFMs representing the production of biomass components
and ﬂavor compounds. Table 3 compares the ﬁve MBDs and 104
RDs. A11 tRNAs are produced in three EFMS, and other amino-
acid—consuming reactions are in other EFMS, except for the
cases of serine and leucine. For example, beside tRNA charging
in three EFMS, cysteine participates in the reaction of phospho-
pantothenate-cysteine ligase for biosynthesis of coenzyme A in
another EFM, goes into the pyruvate pool by cysteine desulfhy-
drase in three other EFMS and produces cystathionine (for pro-
ducing a ﬂavor compound) in one EFM. Taking glycine and
threonine as another example, beside tRNA charging of the
two AAs in 3 EFMS, threonine is converted into 2OBUT by
threonine deaminase for ﬂavor compound production in four
other EFMS, of which threonine is taken up from the medium
in three of the EFMS and is converted from glycine by threonine
aldolase in the other one. In most cases, RD failed to have such
properties. More details can be found in Supplementary
Material.

For leucine, we found that, in all EFMs, tRNA charging was
coupled to the production of a ﬂavor compound, thus insepar-
able. For serine, if EFMs with only one serine-consuming reac-
tion are used, EFMS branching at either threonine or cysteine
must be used. It was observed that all three AAs had one con-
suming reaction producing NH4. We thus suspected that
branches were not separated due to NH4 balance. When ﬁnding
MBD from EFMs with NH4 unbalanced, indeed the issue was
resolved.

From this and the previous examples, an interesting observa-
tion is that the FDs can be represented by most EFMS of indi-
vidual pathways together with a few necessary EFMS coupling

Decomposition by minimal branching elementary flux modes

 

the pathways. It may suggest that while a large part of the
metabolism can be interpreted as the sum of individual path-
ways, at least a small part must be ascribed to cooperation
between pathways.

4 CONCLUSION

MBD to decompose a FD into a set of EFMS was derived. The
EFMS contain as few branching pathways as possible. MBD
advances the analysis of FD by decomposition into EFMs in
three aspects. First, it originates from the consideration of the
branching structure in metabolic network based on experimental
evidence, which is a novel attempt. Second, MBD results in more
biologically relevant EFMS leading to clearer interpretation.
Third, MBD showed good performance regarding uniqueness.
It diminishes the ambiguity of decomposition.

The minimal branching EFM concept underlying MBD can be
useful in further applications, e.g. identifying metabolic path-
ways for engineering by acting as an estimate for biologically
feasible EFMS. Scaling up the method to genome-scale networks
is necessary for practical applicability. In conclusion, MBD is
able to bring useful insights when analyzing FDs. Combining
information from e.g. transcriptional regulation and thermo-
dynamics, wider application of EFMS can be anticipated.

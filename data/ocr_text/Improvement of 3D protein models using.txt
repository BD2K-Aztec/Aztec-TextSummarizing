ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modelling the 3D structures of proteins can often be
enhanced if more than one fold template is used during the modelling
process. However, in many cases, this may also result in poorer
model quality for a given target or alignment method. There is a need
for modelling protocols that can both consistently and significantly
improve 3D models and provide an indication of when models might
not benefit from the use of multiple target-template alignments.
Here, we investigate the use of both global and local model
quality prediction scores produced by ModFOLDclust2, to improve
the selection of target-template alignments for the construction of
multiple-template models. Additionally, we evaluate clustering the
resulting population of multi- and single-template models for the
improvement of our IntFOLD-TS tertiary structure prediction method.
Results: We find that using accurate local model quality scores to
guide alignment selection is the most consistent way to significantly
improve models for each of the sequence to structure alignment
methods tested. In addition, using accurate global model quality
for re-ranking alignments, prior to selection, further improves the
majority of multi-template modelling methods tested. Furthermore,
subsequent clustering of the resulting population of multiple-
template models significantly improves the quality of selected
models compared with the previous version of our tertiary structure
prediction method, IntFOLD-TS.

1 INTRODUCTION

Sequence—structure alignment methods are the springboard of
template—based modelling (TBM). The 3D model output of single—
template modeling methods is based on the top—ranked best available
single template from the most similar protein of known structure
(Tramontano and Cozzetto, 2011). Single—template models built for
sequences with high—sequence identity (50—60%), between target

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and template, are known to provide highly accurate models; <30%
sequence identity (the twilight zone), models must be built using
more intensive fold recognition methods (Tramontano et al., 2008).

Consensus—based fold recognition approaches such as LOMETS
(Wu and Zhang, 2007), 3D—Jury (Ginalski et al., 2003), 3D—
SHOTGUN (Fischer, 2003), Pcons (Lundstrom et al., 2001) and
IntFOLD—TS (McGufﬁn and Roche, 2011; Roche et al., 2011)
improve the selection of single—templates by the use of alternative
models from several independent servers or in—house version of
those methods run as metaservers. The top—ranked consensus
models, however, may not always be the best option due to sub—
optimal alignments. It is important to consider optimal alignments
both at the global (overall protein sequence) and local (regions
such as domains) levels. In addition, the coverage of the target—
template alignment must be considered when evaluating or selecting
3D models to guide experimental work. After all, the nearer—native
a protein model is, the better information it can provide towards
protein design for use in medicine, agriculture, biofuels and other
ﬁelds of applications.

Multiple—template modelling methods that miX and match (Liu
et al., 2008), recombine templates (Contreras—Moreira et al., 2003)
or thread alternative target—template alignments (Peng and Xu,
2011a,b) have been produced in an effort to improve the quality
of predicted 3D models. The advantage of using multiple—template
methods is mainly attributed either to the increased alignment
coverage or the incorporation of the best single template, which is
dependent on alignment accuracy (Larsson et al., 2008) and template
complementarity (Chakravarty et al., 2008; Peng and Xu, 2011a,b).
Additionally, convergence (Chakravarty et al., 2008; Martinez et al.,
2007; Wallner and Elofsson, 2003) is one problem identiﬁed in
the use of multiple templates, which may arise from different
alignments containing contradictory information. The quality of
a model can be improved by combining complementary good
templates, which is especially true for multi—domain targets; but
model quality may deteriorate when there is one template that is
closer to the target than all other available templates. In general,
multiple—template modelling can improve on single—template models
when it can provide an increase in coverage of the target, can give
more useful information such as sequence and structure conservation
and/or conserved distance restraints or can identify better alternative
alignments for harder targets (Cheng, 2008).

Although the last Critical Assessment of Techniques for Protein
Structure Prediction (CASP) competition, CASP9, assessed the
overall state—of—the—art TBM algorithms as high, the assessors
still consider template selection, target—template alignment and

quality prediction as the remaining limiting factors (Mariani et al.,
2011). The top—performing groups have attempted to address
these limiting factors in numerous ways (Peng and Xu, 2011a).
Various single—template and consensus methods incorporate Model
Quality Assessment (MQA) methods to rank alternative models
(Kryshtafovych et al., 2011; McGufﬁn, 2010). PconsM (Larsson
et al., 2011), for example, uses ProQ (Wallner and Elofsson, 2003)
for model quality assessment of the top six models drawn from the
top six template sequences of Pcons.net (Wallner et al., 2007). On
the other hand, RaptorX (Peng and Xu, 2011b) uses TM—score (Xu
and Zhang, 2010; Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) as a quality measure of
the sequence—template alignment, from which the quality of its 3D
model can be estimated. Additionally, MULTICOM (Wang et al.,
2010; 2011) combines multiple templates, alternative alignments
and similar models guided by global model quality assessment.
Furthermore, with I—TASSER (known as Zhang—Server in CASP)
(Roy et al., 2010; Zhang, 2008), the multi—template 3D models
include global conﬁdence scores, which are a measure of their
overall prediction accuracy.

Our own IntFOLD—TS method (McGufﬁn and Roche, 2011;
Roche et al., 2011) integrates ModFOLDclust2 (McGufﬁn and
Roche, 2009) into the core of its pipeline. This MQA tool re—
ranks all alternative models, generated by four in—house versions of
single—template methods, based on their global quality scores. The
accuracy of this method addressed the strong emphasis of CASP9
on assessment of all—atom models producing predicted per—residue
errors (Mariani et al., 2011). However, while we were relatively
successful at providing accurate local error estimates for our CASP9
models, we did not make any attempt at ﬁxing the predicted
errors prior to submission. In an attempt to exploit our accurate
per—residue quality predictions, we have now explored the multiple—
template modelling approach described here. Our approach is to use
the ModFOLDclust2 local and global quality assessment scores,
from the initial single template models, to inform target—template
alignment selection, with the aim of consistently and signiﬁcantly
improving models through multiple—template modeling. The latest
implementation of our template—based modelling server, IntFOLD2—
TS, uses a further iteration of ModFOLDclust2 to rank the resulting
pool of multiple—template models. Our new IntFOLD2—TS method
shows a statistically signiﬁcant improvement over the single—
template methods and consensus single—template methods tested.

2 METHODS

2.1 Datasets and benchmarks

Single— and multiple—template modelling methods were evaluated on both the
CASP8 and CASP9 datasets using the full chain sequences for each target.
Ofﬁcial native 3D structures for full chains and domains were obtained
from the CASP website: http://predictioncenter.org/download_area/. The
observed model quality for the generated models was assessed using the
TM—score program (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004) (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.
umich.edu/TM—score/) to generate structural alignment scores namely; TM—
scores (Xu and Zhang, 2010); GDT_TS (Zemla et al., 2001) scores and
MaxSub (Siew et al., 2000) scores. A statistical analysis of the relative
performance of all the methods was carried out using the Wilcoxon signed—
rank sum test with the R statistical package, version v2.12.1 (http://www.
R—project.org). The statistical signiﬁcance of the differences in observed
model quality scores (TM—scores, GDT_TS—scores and MaxSub scores) was
reﬂected by the calculated P—values produced by these tests. To generate
the P—values, we used the R command: wilcox.test(x, y, paired=TRUE,

alternative: “greater”), where x and y were vectors of observed model
quality scores from different methods.

2.2 Single-template modelling methods and clustering
or consensus methods

Nine different fold recognition methods were installed and run in—house to
generate up to 10 sequence—to—structure alignments each, resulting in up to
90 alternative single—template—based models being generated for each CASP
target. The fold recognition methods used were SP3 and SPARKS2 (referred
to hereafter as SPK2) (Zhou and Zhou, 2005), HHsearch (Soding, 2004),
COMA (Soding et al., 2005) and the ﬁve alternative threading methods that
are integrated into the current LOMETS (Wu and Zhang, 2007) package—
QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSC (http://zhanglab.ccmb.med.umich.
edu/I—TASSER/download/).

For each single—template method, the associated template libraries were
screened so that they only included templates for structures that existed in
the RCSB PDB (www.pdb.org) yearly snapshots (ftp://snapshots.rcsb.org/)
taken prior to the start of each of the CASP experiments. For example, for
the CASP8 target sequences, the template libraries for methods included
only the structures that were available in the PDB on the January 7,
2008. Likewise, for the CASP9 targets, the template libraries included
only the structures that were available in the PDB on the January 4, 2010.
Furthermore, the UniProt (http://www.uniprot.org) sequence databases were
also appropriately screened using a method similar to that carried out by
Chubb et al. (2010). The sequence databases from the January 7, 2008, to
the January 4, 2010, were recreated using the uniprot_trembl.fasta ﬁle and
deposition date ﬁeld found within the associated uniprot_trembl.dat ﬁle: ftp://
ftp.uniprot.org/pub/databases/uniprot/.

In addition to the individual methods described earlier, clustering—based
approaches were used to generate consensus single—template models. The
LOMETS method was installed locally and used with default settings to
select a consensus from a pool of 50 models from 5 methods: QQQ, GGGd,
GGGf, NNNd and SSSC. In addition, the IntFOLD—TS40 method used the
ModFOLDclust2 method with default parameters to select a consensus from
a pool of 40 models from 4 methods: SP3 and SPARKS2, HHsearch and
COMA. (NB. This was similar to the approach we used for the IntFOLD—
TS server method during CASP9; however, in this case, we only used
single—template models and we used older template libraries and sequence
databases—see previous paragraph.) Finally, the IntFOLD—TS90 method
used the ModFOLDclust2 method with default parameters to select a
consensus from a pool of 90 models produced by all 9 single—template
methods (N.B. while methods such as LOMETS and IntFOLD make use
of multiple templates, in this article, we deﬁne multi—template modelling
methods as those that use several alignments to alternative templates to build
an individual model for a given target.)

2.3 Alignment selection methods for
multiple-template modelling

A number of simple target—template alignment selection protocols were
followed and evaluated for the value added to each of the single—template
modelling based methods described earlier. For each method, a multiple
alignment ﬁle was generated, in PIR format, using the individual target—
to—template alignments and Modeller v9.8 (Fiser and Sali, 2003) was
subsequently used to generate multi—template models using the default
parameters and scripts.

2.3.] Method 1 (multil) The top two alignments generated by the single—
template modelling method were used to generate a multi—template model
for each sequence to structure alignment method. In the analysis carried out
by Larsson et al. (2008), performance was observed to peak when just the
top two target—to—template alignments were used to generate multi—template
models, so this was the rationale behind this method.

Improvement of 30 protein models

 

2.3.2 Method 2 (multi2) For this method, the top alignment was used
along with any subsequent alignments, if greater than or equal to 40 new
residues were covered, and if the overlapping regions of covered residues
was less than or equal to 20 residues. If no subsequent alignments were
identiﬁed, then a model was built using the top alignment only. This is similar
to the alignment selection successfully used by Hildebrand et al. (2009).

2.3.3 Method 3 (multi3) This method made use of the ModFOLDclust2—
predicted per—residue errors to guide the alignment selection process if
target—template alignments were found to overlap. The top alignment and
any subsequent alignments were included if any overlapping residues in
the model (built using the subsequent alignment) were predicted to result
in fewer local error scores than those occurring in the models built using
the preceding alignments. The mean local error scores were taken for the
overlapping regions covered by the new residues and then compared with the
best mean local scores from the equivalent local regions previously covered.
If the mean local errors for the overlapping regions were found to be reduced,
then the alignment was included. If no subsequent alignments were identiﬁed,
a model was built using the top alignment only.

2.3.4 Method 4 (multi4) This method was based on the observations made
by Larsson et al. (2008) that when extra templates do not add any extra
coverage to the aligned target sequence, there is little advantage to be gained
from multiple—template modelling. Thus, for this method the top alignment
was used and any subsequent alignments were also included, but only if they
increased coverage of the target by at least 1 residue.

2.3.5 Methods 5, 6, 7 and 8 (multi5 to multi8) Another observation
made by Larsson et al. (2008) was that the global predicted model quality
(particularly for the ﬁrst two alignments) was one of the most important
factors for successful multi—template modelling. Therefore for methods 5, 6,
7 and 8, we repeated methods 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively. However, prior
to alignment selection, the alignments for each of the nine single—template
methods were ﬁrstly re—ranked based on the ModFOLDclust2 predicted
global model quality scores.

2.4 Iteration of clustering for IntFOLDZ-TS: running
ModFOLDclust2 on the resulting set of
multi-template models

The multi—template modelling alignment selection methods described earlier

resulted in the generation of a new population of 84 models for each

target (eight new models each for SP3, SPARKS2, HHsearch, COMA,

QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSC, plus four new models each for

LOMETS, IntFOLD—TS40 and IntFOLD—TS90). These models were then

assessed using ModFOLDclust2 and the top—ranked models were designated

as the IntFOLD2—TS predictions. A ﬂowchart of the complete modelling

pipeline is shown in Supplementary Figure 1.

3 RESULTS

Three structural alignment scoring methods—the GDT_TS (Global
Distance Test Total Score), the TM—score (Template Modelling
score) and the MaxSub score—provide the performance metrics
for the benchmarking. These scores, generated by the TM—score
method, show how similar two protein structures are to each other,
in this case, the model and the experimentally determined native
structure. For clarity and brevity, the results shown in this article
are the benchmarking results against the CASP9 full chain dataset.
However, the full analyses for both the CASP8 and CASP9 full chain
and domain datasets (with and without FM domains) are shown in
the supplementary data. Furthermore, in the supplementary data, an
analysis of the upper limits for multi—template modelling based on

perfect model selection is shown. In this case, the TM— score between
the model and native structure is used to determine the global quality
for each model. The perfect local quality scores are calculated as
the distances between equivalent CA atoms based on the TM—score
superposition between the model and native structures. Although all
structural alignment scores were used for benchmarking, the main
tables and ﬁgures shown here were based on the GDT_TS score,
which has been used as an ofﬁcial CASP measure since CASP4.

The 9—fold—recognition methods that represent single—template
modelling methods are as follows: SP3, SPARKS2 (SPK2),
HHsearch, COMA, QQQ, GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSC. The
consensus methods that cluster— speciﬁc single—template methods and
generate single—template models are represented here by LOMETS,
IntFOLD—T840 and IntFOLD—T890. The multi—template methods
applied to sets of alignments from individual methods are denoted
by the subscript ‘_multi*’ (e.g. sp3_multi3 is the multi—template
modelling Method 3 applied to the SP3 alignments).

3.1 Single-template and consensus modelling methods

An all—against—all pairwise comparison matrix of 12 tertiary structure
modelling methods is presented in Table 1. Calculated Wilcoxon
signed—rank sum test P—values that populate the matrix were
computed based on the GDT_TS scores of CASP9 full chain targets.
A signiﬁcant difference between any two methods is established by
P—value of $0.05 which suggests an improved performance by the
method.

Given the 50.05 P—value threshold, it can be said that the top
three performers, as shown in Table 1 (values in boldface), are SP3,
IntFOLD—T840 and IntFOLD—T890. The SP3 method outperformed
8 out of 11 of the other single—template models. However, SP3 did
not perform signiﬁcantly better than HHsearch (and vice versa) and
only IntFOLD—T840 and IntFOLD—T890 signiﬁcantly outperformed
the method. IntFOLD—T840 P—values were better in 10 out of
11 methods, and IntFOLD—T890 signiﬁcantly outperformed all
methods. Slight variations of results can be seen in the P—values
of the rest of the full chain and domain datasets of CASP8 and
CASP9 and using different scoring metrics (Supplementary Tables).
However, the consensus method, IntFOLD—T890, was the consistent
top performer, showing statistically signiﬁcant improvements over
methods, across all datasets.

3.2 Multiple-template modelling based on original
alignment rankings from the single-template
modelling methods

The multiple—template models referred to as multil, multi2, multi3
and multi4 used information drawn from the top—ranked and
subsequent ranked alignments based on the original single—template
method rankings. The improvement in model quality from each
multi—template modelling method is referred to here as the added—
value.

Figure 1 shows a plot of the relative added—value (or cost) of multi—
template modelling arrived at by totalling all the GDT_TS scores of
all targets for each method. The sum of each single—template method
is then subtracted from the sum of each corresponding multiple—
template method as well as from the sum of each consensus method.
This difference, whether positive or negative, represents the added—
value or cost, respectively, of using each multiple—template method
over single—template modelling.

H0: The method in the column produces models that are equal or lower in quality than
those produced by the method in the row. H1: the method in the column produces
higher quality models than the method in the row. P-values $0.05 indicate signiﬁcant
differences (in boldface). The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum testP—values were calculated
using GDT_TS scores of 117 CASP9 full chain targets.

The histogram for GDT_TS scores in Figure 1 shows that the
multi3 method adds value to each of the single—template modelling
methods. The highest relative added—value is for COMA; the lowest,
for QQQ. While the single highest added—value calculated is from
the multi4 method for HHsearch, this method also recorded the
highest cost for SPK2. Fluctuations between overall added value
and cost were noted for both multil and multi4. The added values
or costs associated with using multi2 were all marginal. Across
CASP8 and CASP9 datasets, similar trends in the added—value or
cost associated with each multi—template modelling method were
noted (see Supplementary Figures).

The added—value is the essential criterion providing answer
to the question ‘Which is the best multi—template modelling
method?’. Table 2 informs not only on the signiﬁcant
differences between paired multiple—template and single—template
or clustering/consensus methods but also identiﬁes the best
multiple—template selection approach. Again, a P—value 50.05
suggests a signiﬁcant difference between two methods and the
method with 50.05 P—value possesses a better model quality. Similar
tables for other datasets and scoring metrics are shown in the
Supplementary Tables.

Fig. 1. Added—value or cost to cumulative GDT_TS scores by using each
multiple—template modelling method (CASP9 full chain dataset)

The ‘multi3’ method consistently outperformed almost all
the single—template and consensus/clustering methods across all
datasets. The only exception was IntFOLD—T890 for CASP9 full
chain targets (Table 2). Likewise, multil and multi4 methods
performed well over some single—template and consensus/clustering
methods although their performance was inconsistent across CASP8
and CASP9 datasets. Multi2 trailed the other three methods in
terms of performance; and in some cases did not improve on the
performance of any methods (Supplementary Tables).

3.3 Multiple-template modelling methods using
ModFOLDclust2 re-ranked alignments

The histogram in Figure 2 is interpreted in the same way as
Figure 1, but in this case, the target—template alignments from
each single—template method are ﬁrst re—ranked according to the
ModFOLDclust2 global scores for the resulting models (IntFOLD—
TS40, IntFOLD—T890 and LOMETS already use clustering to rank
models by predicted global quality, so there is no need to re—
rank). In Figure 2, note that while multi7 generally leads all other
multiple—template modelling methods, the performance of multi6 is
a close second. Although ﬂuctuations in performance are shown by
multi5 and multi8, there is an improvement in added—values for both
methods compared with multil and multi4. Furthermore, multi7,
which uses per—residue errors to guide target—template alignments
consistently improves over all single—template methods.

H0: The method in the column produces models that are equal or lower in quality than
those produced by the method in the row. H1: the method in the column produces
higher quality models than the method in the row. P-values $0.05 indicate signiﬁcant
differences (in boldface). The Wilcoxon signed-rank sum test P-values were calculated
using GDT_TS scores of 117 CASP9 full chain targets.

HHsearch and COMA derived most of the improvement from
multi—template modelling based on the CASP9 dataset (Figure 2).
COMA was the most consistently improved using all multi—template
modelling methods for both the CASP8 and CASP9 targets. QQQ,
GGGd, GGGf, NNNd and SSSC were the least improved overall,
and in some cases, did worse when benchmarked against the CASP8
dataset. The cost to SP3 and SPK2 from multiple—template modelling
was reduced by re—ranking alignments, and SPK2_multi5 showed a
positive added—value compared with SPK2_multi1. Improvements
are evident across all methods shown by higher cumulative scores;
however, it is the multi7 method (the multi3 method using re—ranked
alignments) that shows consistent improvements according all plots.
The results in Table 3 suggest that re—ranking alignments by using
ModFOLDclust2 global quality scores is providing additional value
to each of the multiple template modelling methods tested.

3.4 IntFOLD2-TS—a consensus approach using
multi-template models

The IntFOLD2—TS method is a consensus approach that uses
ModFOLDclust2 to rank the multiple—template models produced
using all methods (multil—multi7) and all target—template alignment
methods (a total of 84 models). Here, the results are shown variously
as cumulative model quality scores in Figure 3 (Supplementary
Figures) and as calculated P—values for the pairwise Wilcoxon
signed—rank sum tests shown in Table 4 (Supplementary Tables).

Fig. 3. Cumulative GDT_TS scores for single—template, multiple—template
and consensus modelling methods (CASP9 full chain dataset)

Figure 3 shows the incremental improvements to cumulative
GDT_TS scores from the multi—template modelling methods multi3
and multi7, put in context within the consensus single—template
approaches and the consensus multi—template approach used by
the IntFOLD2—TS method. The cumulative score for SP3 single—
template modelling provides the baseline score. The models built
from SP3 alignments are improved by 2.76% using the multi3
multi—template modelling method, beyond the level achieved by
the consensus single—template approach used by IntFOLD—T840.
A further improvement in the cumulative score (3.70%) can be
seen using the multi7 method where alignments are re—ranked using
ModFOLDclust2, prior to selection. In addition, IntFOLD—T840 and
IntFOLD—T890 methods have improved scores using the multi3
method. However, the highest cumulative score is for IntFOLD2—TS
(9.97%), which is gained by using ModFOLDclust2 to cluster the
multi—template models from all methods. A similar trend is shown in
Supplementary Tables using alternative datasets and scoring metrics
with the IntFOLD2—TS method providing the highest cumulative
score in all tests.

The pairwise matrix of P—values in Table 4 shows the signiﬁcance
of differences between methods. Signiﬁcant improvements
(P<0.05) over the baseline method SP3 are shown by using the
consensus single—template methods (IntFOLD—T840 and IntFOLD—
TS 90) and the multiple—template modelling approaches (SP3_multi3
and SP3_multi7). Furthermore, the new IntFOLD2—TS method
provides signiﬁcantly higher quality models than all other methods
(Supplementary Tables).

The incremental reﬁnements brought about by consensus/
clustering method and the multiple—template methods shown in
Figure 3, are illustrated structurally for an example target (T0623)
in Figure 4. The PyMOL (http://www.pymol.org) cartoon views of
superpositions depict where the improvements of the models (grey)
have been made relative to the native structure (white). The target’s
native structure was solved by X—ray diffraction (PDB ID 3NKH).

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we evaluate alternative methods for the selection of
target—template alignments for multiple—template modelling, using
the alignments generated by a number of alternative single—template
modelling methods. We explore the use of ModFOLDclust2 local
and global model quality assessment scores as a discriminatory
measure to reﬁne the selection of better target—template alignments

Fig. 4. SP3 model quality is incrementally improved by multi—template
methods with alignment selection reﬁned by the use of ModFOLDclust2.
All images were rendered in PyMOL

prior to multi—template modelling. Although there is a basic nuance
that using multiple templates will translate into a better model, this
is shown not to be true in all cases and success is dependent on the
target—template selection method used.

Comprehensive analyses of our multiple—template models showed
that there are appropriate combinations of templates that will lead
to improvement of a model quality over that of the single—template
model. When that combination is not found, then multiple—template
modelling will not provide a better option over single—template

modelling and may sometimes lead to a deterioration of model
quality. The aim of multiple—template modelling should not be to
simply ‘mix and match’ segments of templates to achieve more
coverage; it should, most importantly, be to improve model quality.

From benchmarking the alternative alignment selection
approaches on the CASP8 and CASP9 full chain and domain
datasets, we have found that the most consistent way to signiﬁcantly
improve models is to make use of accurate predicted local model
quality scores to guide alignment selection. Furthermore, using
accurate global quality prediction scores, for re—ranking the order
of alignments prior to selection, signiﬁcantly improves most of
the multi—template modelling methods tested. This corroborates
the ﬁndings of Larsson et al. (2008). The upper theoretical limits
of these strategies are investigated through use of perfect model
quality assessment scores (Supplementary Tables and Figures).
The results indicate that there is room for improvement and it is
therefore worthwhile putting further effort into developing more
accurate model assessment to guide multi—template modeling.

Overall, SP3 proved to be a competitive single—template method
when tested on the CASP9 datasets and it provides a useful baseline
single template modelling method. The increased performance of
both IntFOLD—T840 and IntFOLD—T890 relative to SP3 points again
to the usefulness of generating consensus single—template models
using ModFOLDclust2. However, these simple consensus methods
only make use of the ModFOLDclust2 global scores and do not
exploit the accurate per—residue error predictions. According to the
CASP9 assessors accurate per—residue error predictions are crucial
indicators of a model’s usefulness. Here, we are now capitalizing
on the accuracy of ModFOLDclust2 for predicting model quality at
both the global and per—residue level, using identiﬁed errors in single
template models to guide alignment selection for multi—template
modelling.

The multi3 and multi7 methods were observed to be the
best performing methods and they consistently and signiﬁcantly
improved model quality for all of the original sequence—structure
alignment methods, on all datasets and according to all model
quality scoring metrics. The multi3 works by simply rejecting
any subsequent target—template alignment after the top hit, if the
overlapping local regions from the alignment are not predicted to
improve the local model quality according to ModFOLDclust2. The
multi7 method uses essentially the same approach but the target—
template alignments for each method are ﬁrstly re—ordered using the
ModFOLDclust2 global scores.

Improvement of 30 protein models

 

In comparison, the methods multi2, multi4, which were based
on improving alignment coverage, and the multil method were
not as consistent. The multil and multi4 methods worked well
for some sequence—structure alignment methods such as HHsearch.
However, these methods often lead to lower quality models, on
average, particularly when applied to the SPK2 and SP3 alignments.
The HHsearch method, which generates optimal local alignment,
to alternative templates, may beneﬁt more from any additional
coverage by alternative templates, whereas the SP3 and SPK2
methods will attempt to thread the full sequence even if some local
regions are not adequately covered by a single template.

The multi2 method is a bit more conservative than the multil
and multi4 methods; in most instances, using the method leads to
a marginal improvement in model quality. In some cases, there is a
cost associated with using the multi2 method; however, it is never as
detrimental as using multil and multi4 methods. In many cases, the
multil, multi2 and multi4 alignment selection methods can be made
more consistent by ﬁrstly re—ranking target—template alignments
using ModFOLDclust2 (multi5, multi6 and multi8, respectively),
but again this does not work in all cases.

Multi—template modelling using the target—template alignment
methods described here leads to the generation of a new population
of models that are of higher model quality on average than the
population of single template models. This is demonstrated by the
improved performance achieved by the IntFOLD2—TS method which
uses ModFOLDclust2 to rank the population of 84 multi—template
models, versus the IntFOLD—T890 method which only ranks
the initial population of single—template models. The IntFOLD2—
TS method has been incorporated into the new IntFOLD server
(Roche et al, 2011), which will be tested during the CASP10
prediction season, where it is registered as IntFOLD2, as well as
being continuously assessed by the CAMEO3D server (http://www.
cameo3d.orgl), where it is currently listed as development server12.
The server will shortly be made freely publicly available via http://
www.reading.ac.uk/bioinf/IntFOLD/. In addition, we freely provide
the source code and executables for the multi—template modelling
methods described here for use with any set of sequence—to—structure
alignments and associated quality assessment ﬁle provided in CASP
QMODE2 format.

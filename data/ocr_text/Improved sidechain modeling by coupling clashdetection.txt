ABSTRACT

Motivation: Side-chain modeling has seen wide applications in
computational structure biology. Most of the popular side-chain
modeling programs explore the conformation space using discrete
rigid rotamers for speed and efficiency. However, in the tightly packed
environments of protein interiors, these methods will inherently lead
to atomic clashes and hinder the prediction accuracy.

Results: We present a side-chain modeling method (ClS-RR),
which couples a novel clash-detection guided iterative search (CIS)
algorithm with continuous torsion space optimization of rotamers
(RR). Benchmark testing shows that compared with the existing
popular side-chain modeling methods, ClS-RR removes atomic
clashes much more effectively and achieves comparable or even
better prediction accuracy while having comparable computational
cost. We believe that ClS-RR could be a useful method for accurate
side-chain modeling.

1 INTRODUCTION

Side—chain modeling is the prediction of a protein’s side—chain
conformation for a given backbone structure. Due to its importance
in protein design (Dahiyat and Mayo, 1997), point mutation analysis
(Feyfant et al., 2007), protein—protein docking (Wang et al.,
2005), homology modeling (Fiser et al., 2002) and other aspects
of structural modeling, side—chain modeling has been intensively
studied for many years. A thorough search through the continuous
side—chain conformations is inefﬁcient and not feasible given
the existing search algorithms and current computational power.
Luckily, side—chain dihedral angles are not evenly distributed, which
occur in tight clusters around certain values (Benedetti et al., 1983;
Bhat et al., 1979; Chandras and Ramachan, 1970; Janin et al.,

1978; Ponder and Richards, 1987). Based on these clusters, the
side—chain conformational space can be discretized into rotamers
which represent the conformations of these clusters, and an ensemble
of rotamers for all side—chain types is thus called a rotamer
library (Dunbrack, 2002; Dunbrack and Cohen, 1997; Dunbrack
and Karplus, 1993, 1994). Based on rotamer deﬁnition, side—chain
modeling can be efﬁciently transformed into a combinatorial search
problem which is to ﬁnd the best rotamer combination from all
possible combinations of side—chain rotamers. For this methodology,
many efforts have attempted including development of powerful
scoring functions (Eyal et al., 2004; Jacobson et al., 2002; Liang and
Grishin, 2002; Lu et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2004), well—sampled
rotamer libraries (DeMaeyer et al., 1997; Dunbrack and Cohen,
1997; Krivov et al., 2009; Xiang and Honig, 2001) and effective
search strategies (Canutescu et al., 2003; Desmet et al., 1992, 2002;
Hwang and Liao, 1995; Kingsford et al., 2005; Koehl and Delarue,
1995; Leach and Lemon, 1998; Liu et al., 2003; Xu, 2005). So far,
rotamer—based side—chain modeling methods have become the most
popular ones. However, because the side—chain conformations are
approximated by discrete rotamers, these methods could inherently
cause atomic clashes in the modeled structures, preventing them
from accurate modeling of protein side chains. Furthermore, atomic
clashes can lead to high energy and instability of structures, and thus
the elimination of atomic clashes is beneﬁcial for the subsequent
analysis such as protein—protein docking (Wang et al., 2005; Zhang
and Duan, 2006). Atomic clashes can be alleviated to some extent
by utilizing a very large rotamer library (Peterson et al., 2004;
Xiang and Honig, 2001) or expanding a rotamer into ﬁnely sampled
subrotamers (Krivov et al., 2009; Mendes et al., 1999). Other more
sophisticated approaches could include an additional step of rotamer
reﬁnement by off—rotamer space sampling (Krieger et al., 2009;
Wang et al., 2005).

In our study, to achieve a more effective side—chain modeling,
we attempt to integrate the advances from side—chain modeling
in both rotamer—based search and rotamer optimization. Our
method, called CIS—RR, performs clash—detection guided iterative
search (CIS) of side—chain rotamers while continuously optimizes
side—chain conformations using a conjugate gradients method.
Careful implementation of CIS—RR shows obvious improvements of
prediction accuracy and elimination of atomic clashes, in contrast
with the traditional iterative search method. Further benchmark
testing shows, compared with the existing popular side—chain
modeling programs, CIS—RR removes atomic clashes much more
effectively and achieves comparable or even better prediction

accuracy while having comparable computational cost. The methods
and results will be elaborated in the following sections.

2 METHODS
2.1 Rotamer library

In this work, we use Dunbrack backbone—dependent rotamer library (version
of May 2002) (Dunbrack and Cohen, 1997; Dunbrack and Karplus, 1993). We
also obtained the protein’s standard bond lengths and angles from CHARMM
(Brooks et al., 1983). Rotamers with a probability < 1% are ignored.

2.2 Scoring function

The scoring function was adapted from that of SCWRL3 (Canutescu et al.,
2003), which consists of two terms:

E = EvdW + krotErot (1)

Evdw is an empirical van der Waals potential. SCWRL3 only includes a
piecewise linear repulsive term. In this work, a quadratic attractive term is
also included. For a pair of atoms,

krep(l—r,-j/R,-j) for I’l‘jSRij
Evdww): k... [(l’z‘j/Rij)2 —3.0(r.-,-/R.-,-)+2.0] for Rz-j < rij < 2-0Rz-j <2)
 for I’l‘j Z 

where rl-j is the interatomic distance between atoms i and j and Rl-j is the sum
of their effective van der Waals radii, which are obtained from Chothia’s
work (Chothia, 1976) with a 5% reduction. The hydrogen atoms are ignored.

Erot is the rotamer term, which measures the preferences of the side—chain
conformers. For a rotamer rm of residue m,

_ p(rm lab. go) Mr...) — mu. 2
Erot(rm) — y <—10g(m ) +ktor;( glib—n ) > 

where p(rm|¢,<p) is the rotamer library probability for the given backbone
dihedral angle q) and (,0. It is normalized to the maximum probability
p(max lqb, (p) of residue m in the same backbone dihedral angles (Canutescu
et al., 2003). We also considered a second term to penalize the drifting of
side—chain dihedral angles away from the nearest rotamer library values. The
side—chain dihedral angle xn(rm) is the n—th X dihedral angle of rm XML” and
01,-an are the corresponding rotamer library dihedral angle and its standard
deviation. Since aromatic side—chains are subject to have clashes, their Erot
could be underestimated compared with their Evdw. Thus the scaling factor
y is introduced and set as follows:

, if rm 6 {His, Phe, Tyr, Trp}
, if rm 6 {Gly, Ala} (4)

, otherwise

y:

l—‘ON

The parameters (kr0t=0.35, krep=5.882, katt=0.08 and kt0r=0.4) of the
scoring function were obtained by training on 55 high—resolution crystal
structures that were randomly selected from the Protein Data Bank (PDB;
Berman et al., 2000). We followed the training procedure used by former
works (Liang and Grishin, 2002; Petrella et 01., 1998; Wilson et 01., 1993;
Xiang et al., 2007). In brief, parameters were systematically optimized by
searching the best conformation of one residue each time while keeping the
others ﬁxed in their native conformations.

2.3 Disulﬁde bonds

Before performing the scoring function calculation, CIS—RR uses the formula
E 33 = 0.1 'S —4.0 to evaluate the cysteine pair, which forms a disulﬁde bond.
S is the disulﬁde bond score as used in SCWRL3 (Canutescu et al., 2003). If
the side chains of the cysteine pairs form disulﬁde bonds (ESS < 0), ESS will
be added to the scoring function.

2.4 Rotamer relaxation

In this work, rotamer relaxation (RR) is implemented by using a conjugate
gradients method to optimize the side—chain dihedral angles near the rotamer
value. The conjugate gradients method follows Fletcher—Reeves algorithm
(Fletcher and Reeves, 1964). To produce a set of directions to rotate a
side—chain, the directions are calculated from the derivatives of the scoring
function with respect to side—chain dihedral angles:

The derivative of the van der Waals potential for each of the dihedral angle

Xn is

  A  A  A graxis X  A
EédW(X”)=ZZ —i+—j+— '—HSi
i j arij axi ayi azi 5 axis X S i

where xi, yi,z,- is the Cartesian coordinates of atom i constrained by X”. Ems
is the unit vector of the torsion axis of X”. 3,- is the perpendicular vector

from atom i to the torsion axis Ems (Supplementary Fig. S1 and Table S1).

Material.
The derivative of the rotamer term for each of the dihedral angle xn is

2.5 CIS-RR

The CIS—RR operates as follows:

First, the starting side—chain conformation of each residue is constructed
by the rotamers with the highest probability at each position. Then, for
each residue i, every one of its rotamers will be optimized as described
in the Section 2.4 and tested for clashes with other residues that are kept
ﬁxed. If a rotamer r has clashes with other residues (i.e. the score of the
van der Waals term > 1.0), rotamer r is ﬁxed temporarily and the clashing
residues will change to each of the other rotamers, proceeding with RR. After
all rotamers of the residue i are explored, the side—chain conformations of
residue i or residue i and its clashing residues will be updated with side—chain
dihedral angles that generate the lowest score during the search. The more
detailed process is described as pseudocodes (Fig. 1). The above process
keeps iterating from the most exposed residue to the least until the score
converges to a stable value.

Improve side-chain modeling by CIS-RR

 

Clash—detection step plays an important role in CIS—RR. According to our
analysis, ~46% tested rotamers have clashes with other residues. Detailed
information is provided in Supplementary Table S2.

For CIS without RR, the RR process is bypassed in the above procedure.

2.6 Traditional iterative search coupled with RR

Traditional iterative search coupled with RR (TIS—RR) tests every rotamer
for a given residue while keeping other residues ﬁxed. All the rotamers are
subjected to RR and the one resulting in the lowest score will replace the
original one. It updates one residue at a time and keeps looping until the side
chains stop changing conformations.

For TIS without RR, the RR process is bypassed in the above procedure.

2.7 Evaluation methods

The modeling accuracy is deﬁned as the percentage of correctly predicted
side—chain X1 and X1+2 dihedral angles within a threshold of 400 compared
with the crystal structures (Bower et al., 1997; Eyal et al., 2004; Liang and
Grishin, 2002). In our work, the modeling accuracy is also indicated by
root mean square deviation (RMSD) of side—chain heavy atoms. It calculates
the square root of the mean of the square distances over all atoms from
the predicted structures to the crystal ones. Before evaluating accuracy, the
crystallographically symmetric terminal groups of Asp, Glu, Phe, Arg and
Tyr are ﬂipped to yield optimal atom matching. For Asn, Gln and His, due
to the difﬁculty to distinguish different terminal atoms, their terminal groups
are also ﬂipped (Eyal et al., 2004).

The atomic clash is also used to evaluate the modeling structures. If two
atoms over two bonds away have the distance <60% of the sum of their
respective van der Waals radii, they are regarded as an atomic clash.

2.8 Benchmark testing

Two different test sets have been used in our study. The ﬁrst test set consists
of 180 crystal structures, which were obtained from the test set of SCWRL3
(Canutescu et al., 2003). It was used to examine the contributions of the two
components of CIS—RR, namely CIS and RR, to the side—chain modeling.
For a fair comparison, CIS—RR, CIS, TIS—RR and TIS all start from the
same initial side—chain conformations in the testing. The second test set
was used to compare CIS—RR with several popular side—chain modeling
programs. It consists of 65 high—resolution crystal structures that were used
in previous side—chain modeling studies (Harder et al., 2010; Jain et al.,
2006; Lu et al., 2008; Peterson et al., 2004). All the tests were run on an
Intel Q9550 processor.

2.9 Software availability
CIS—RR is implemented in C++ and has been complied on Linux system.

The executable version of our method is now available to non—commercial
users at http://jianglab.ibp.ac.cn/lims/cisrr/cisrr.html.

3 RESULTS

In this section, we will ﬁrst give an overview of our method CIS—
RR. Then we will analyze the contributions of CIS and RR to the
improvement of side—chain modeling and further investigate how
CIS—RR effectively eliminates clashes. Finally, to gain an overall
performance of CIS—RR, we compare it to several existing popular
side—chain modeling programs.

3.1 Overview of CIS-RR

CIS—RR is a side—chain modeling program that performs CIS and
RR simultaneously (Section 2 and Fig. 1). Previously, TIS based on
single residues has been attempted in side—chain modeling, which

each time simply searches all rotamers of a given residue for the
best one while keeping other residues ﬁxed (Dunbrack and Karplus,
1993; Xiang and Honig, 2001). This method is relatively fast and
able to couple with RR easily. However, it is sensitive to the former
states and tends to get trapped in local minima, which hinders the
modeling accuracy. To efﬁciently improve this method, we employ
a clash—detection step to help side chains jump out of the local
minima that is blocked by the mispacked surrounding residues. The
implementation of CIS can not only effectively improve accuracy
and resolve clashes but also achieve a desirable speed in side—chain
modeling, for which we will show the results later.

RR samples off—rotamer side—chain conformations quite
effectively, but it usually cannot produce large enough changes of
the dihedral angles to correct the mispacked rotamers. In the pioneer
work from Baker lab, Wang et al. implemented a method, called
RTMIN, which couples TIS with RR (i.e. side—chain minimization)
to optimize side chains (Krieger et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2005).
Inspired by their work, we couple the improved search algorithm
CIS with RR and ﬁnd that CIS—RR is superior to TIS—RR for
its effectively removing clashes and signiﬁcantly improving the
accuracy of side—chain modeling.

3.2 The CIS and RR both contribute to the
improvement of side-chain modeling over TIS

First, we compare CIS with TIS in side—chain modeling. For ease
of comparison, both methods searched through the same rotamer
library without RR. As shown in Table 1, compared with TIS, CIS
dramatically reduces the number of atomic clashes from 224 to 125
out of 180 proteins while incurring a moderate increase in time
consumption. Moreover, the accuracy of side—chain modeling has
also been improved by CIS: the X1 and X1+2 of the whole proteins
have been improved 1.3% (84.7% by CIS versus 83.4% by TIS) and
1.7% (73.8% by CIS versus 72.1% by TIS), respectively, and the
RMSD has decreased 0.1 A (from 1.78 A to 1.68 A).

Then we investigate to what extent RR contributes to side—chain
modeling by comparing TIS—RR to TIS. Table 1 shows that RR
effectively reduces the number of clashed residues from 224 to 63
out of 180 proteins. Moreover, the X1 and X1+2 have also been
improved 0.5% (83.9% TIS—RR versus 83.4% TIS) and 1.5% (73.6%
TIS—RR versus 72.1% TIS), respectively, for all residues; and the
RMSD has decreased 0.08A (from 1.78A to 1.70 A). However,
RR is a time—consuming step, which incurs a signiﬁcant increase of
computation time (3—5 times of that without RR).

The above analyses clearly show that both CIS and RR can
improve side—chain modeling not only in the elimination of atomic
clashes but also in the accuracy of side—chain modeling in terms of
number of correct X dihedral angles and RMSD. Remarkably, when
both CIS and RR are integrated into the framework of CIS—RR, the
side—chain modeling can be further improved. For the elimination of
residue clashes, CIS—RR leaves only 15 clashed residues unresolved
in the 180 proteins tested, which is much better than the use of RR
or CIS alone (Table 1). For the accuracy improvement in terms of
correct X dihedral angles and RMSD, CIS—RR causes the X1 and
X1+2 improvement of 2.3% and 3.8% (from 83.4% to 85.7% and
72.1% to 75.9%), RMSD decrease of0.21 A (from 1.78 Ato 1.57 A),
greater than the improvement summation of CIS (1 .3%, 1.7%, 0.1 A)
and TIS—RR (0.5%, 1.5%, 0.08 A). Taking D—ribose—binding protein
(PDB ID: 2DRI) as an example, the percent correct for X1 and X1+2

is 89.3% and 78.6% by using CIS—RR, which have been signiﬁcantly
improved, compared with 84.8%, 70.6% by TIS—RR and 87.6%,
75.4% by CIS. This suggests that CIS and RR, when integrated
into CIS—RR, collectively improve the performance of side—chain
modeling.

3.3 Analysis of the performance of CIS-RR on
individual residues

Next, we sought to ﬁnd out how CIS—RR works on different types
of amino acids. Figure 2 shows that CIS—RR improves the percent
correct of both X1 and X1+2 dihedral angles of all amino acids.
The improvements are more signiﬁcant for the amino acids with
aromatic side—chains (Phe His, Trp and Tyr). For example, the X1+2
improvement of Trp is up to almost 20% (Fig. 2 and Supplementary
Table S3). Our further analysis showed that for side—chain modeling
by TIS, the four residues constitute about half of the clashes due
to their large—size terminal groups (Supplementary Table S3). In

CIS—RR the clashes of these four residues can be signiﬁcantly
reduced to seven clashes (Supplementary Table S3). Therefore, by
focusing on elimination of clashes, our method CIS—RR efﬁciently
corrects the mispacked conformations and thus improves the side—
chain modeling, particularly for those of large size that is easy to
cause clashes in the well—packed proteins.

3.4 Comparison of CIS-RR with the existing popular
side-chain modeling programs

To gain an overall performance of CIS—RR, we further tested it
on another popular test dataset consisting of 65 high—resolution
crystal structures by making comparisons with several popular side—
chain modeling programs, SCWRL4 (Krivov et al., 2009), IRECS
(Hartmann et al., 2007), Sccomp (Eyal et al., 2004) and SCAP
(Xiang and Honig, 2001). SCWRL is probably the most widely
used program in the ﬁeld. The latest version is SCWRL4, which
is improved from SCWRL3 (Canutescu et al., 2003) by using the
new rotamer library, more efﬁcient search algorithms and a soft van
der Waals potential plus hydrogen bonding based scoring function.
IRECS does an efﬁcient ensemble selection of most probable side—
chain conformations using a knowledge—based statistical potential.
Sccomp takes into account solvent accessibility and contact surfaces
in the scoring function for accurate modeling. SCAP employs the
iterative procedure and CHARMM force ﬁeld to search through a
very large rotamer library. All those methods are based on discrete
rotamers.

Table 2 shows the test results of the ﬁve programs, in which CIS—
RR achieved prediction accuracies of 86.4% and 76.7% for X1 and
X1+2, respectively (see Supplementary Table S4 for the predicted
accuracy of each protein). These results illustrate that, in terms of
percent correct for dihedral angles, CIS—RR is comparable with
SCWRL4, and better than IRECS, Sccomp and SCAP, especially
for X1+2 (~5% higher accuracy). Notably, in terms of number of
clashes, CIS—RR eliminates almost all the clashes (2 clashes in 65
proteins) and outperforms the other four programs. However, due
to the time consuming RR process, the run time of CIS—RR (15 min
for 65 proteins) is longer than SCWRL4, IRECS and Sccomp.

We further compared the performance of CIS—RR and SCWRL4
over individual amino acids. As shown in Figure 3 and
Supplementary Table 85, among 18 types of amino acids (excluding
Ala and Gly), CIS—RR showed better performance for 13 amino
acids, especially for Cys, Trp and Met. This can be attributed to
the efﬁcient sampling of rotamer and off—rotamer conformations
by CIS—RR. However, for the short polar amino acids (Asp, Asn
and Ser), CIS—RR shows lower performance, which could be due

to their difference in scoring functions. Compared with SCWRL4,
CIS—RR does not include the hydrogen bonding effects in the scoring
function. Supplementary Table 85 also illustrates that CIS—RR
eliminates their clashes more effectively, particular for these residues
with large—size side chains as described above. Taken together, we
argue that CIS—RR and SCWRL4 are complementary approaches
by nature in side—chain modeling, which suggests the signiﬁcance
of our work by focusing on effective clash elimination.

4 CONCLUSION

In order to improve the discrete rigid rotamer model, we developed a
side—chain modeling program that integrates clash—detection guided
iterative search with RR in the framework CIS—RR. Our analysis
shows that the good performance of CIS—RR in side—chain modeling
is mainly due to its effectiveness in clash elimination, which is
achieved by extensive sampling of side—chain conformation space

through the coupling of CIS and RR. Since CIS—RR is able to
effectively relieve atomic clashes in the modeled structures with a
desirable speed, it would be a very useful method for accurate side—
chain modeling that can complement the current existing methods
for subsequent analysis and reﬁnement of protein structures.

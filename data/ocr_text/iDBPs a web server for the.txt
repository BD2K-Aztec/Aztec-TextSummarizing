ABSTRACT

Summary: The iDBPs server uses the three-dimensional (3D)
structure of a query protein to predict whether it binds DNA. First,
the algorithm predicts the functional region of the protein based
on its evolutionary profile; the assumption is that large clusters of
conserved residues are good markers of functional regions. Next,
various characteristics of the predicted functional region as well as
global features of the protein are calculated, such as the average
surface electrostatic potential, the dipole moment and cluster-based
amino acid conservation patterns. Finally, a random forests classifier
is used to predict whether the query protein is likely to bind DNA and
to estimate the prediction confidence. We have trained and tested
the classifier on various datasets and shown that it outperformed
related methods. On a dataset that reflects the fraction of DNA
binding proteins (DBPs) in a proteome, the area under the ROC curve
was 0.90. The application of the server to an updated version of the
N-Func database, which contains proteins of unknown function with
solved 3D-structure, suggested new putative DBPs for experimental
studies.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA binding proteins (DBPs) compose a considerable part of the
proteomes of the various organisms (Nimrod et al., 2009), and take
part in various processes, such as DNA transcription, replication and
packing. There are a number of approaches for the identiﬁcation
of DBPs. Some methods look for direct similarity between the
query protein and DBPs (e.g. Gao and Skolnick, 2008; Shanahan
et al., 2004). When the DNA binding domain is novel, methods
that do not rely directly on previous data may be advantageous.
Such methods often rely on electrostatic features of the proteins.
DNA is negatively charged, and the DNA binding region of the
protein is often positively charged. Therefore, features of positively
charged patches on the proteins’ surfaces have been examined in
order to identify DBPs (Bhardwaj et al. , 2005; Stawiski et al., 2003).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Other features that represent the distribution of charges within the
protein structure have also been used (Ahmad and Sarai, 2004;
Szilagyi and Skolnick, 2006), as well as secondary structure content
(Stawiski et al., 2003) and the amino acid composition (Szilagyi and
Skolnick, 2006).

We recently developed a method for the prediction of DBPs
based on the identiﬁcation of the functional region within the query
protein (Nimrod et al., 2009). We showed that patches of highly
conserved amino acids, detected by PatchFinder (Nimrod et al.,
2008), often delineate the functional regions in proteins in general,
and the core of DNA binding regions within DBPs in particular
(Nimrod et al., 2009).

Using features of the predicted functional regions and additional
global features, we trained a random forests classiﬁer (Breiman,
2001) on a dataset of 138 DBPs and 110 proteins that do not bind
DNA (Szilagyi and Skolnick, 2006).

We examined the classiﬁer on a realistic dataset that reﬂects the
fraction of DBPs in proteomes. We evaluated this fraction to be 14%
and extended the original dataset by 733 additional proteins that do
not bind DNA. The sensitivity and the precision on this dataset were
0.90 and 0.35, respectively, with the default prediction score cutoff.
The area under the ROC curve (AUC) was 0.90. We also showed
that the performance of the classiﬁer was superior to related methods
(Nimrod et al., 2009).

Here, we present the iDBPs web server, which implements the
classiﬁer. The server is freely available at http://idbps.tau.ac.il/. It is
easy to use and only requires the PDB ﬁle (or PDB id) and the chain
identiﬁer of the protein of interest.

2 RESULTS

The N—Func database is a collection, which we recently established,
of proteins of known three-dimensional (3D)-structure that lack
functional annotation (Nimrod et al., 2008). The functional region
of each of the proteins in N—Func was predicted using PatchFinder as
a ﬁrst step toward the annotation of these proteins. Here, we present
an updated version of the database, which includes 973 PDB entries
and their predicted functional regions.

Next, we applied the iDBPs server to N—Func in order to identify
potential DNA binders. The results, available as Supplementary
Table 1, include the prediction score of each protein as well as the
corresponding estimated precision and sensitivity.

Using the default prediction threshold, 233 proteins were
identiﬁed as potential DBPs. At this threshold, the expected precision
is only 0.35, while the sensitivity is 0.9. However, one can ﬁlter

iDBPs: a web server for the identification of DNA binding proteins

 

the results using different thresholds in order to gather predictions
with high precision. Supplementary Figure 2 presents an example
of predicted DBP from N—Func.

We previously showed that many of the patches cover most of the
hydrogen bonds within the protein—DNA interface in DBPs (Nimrod
et al. , 2009). Here, we also show that they cover most of the interface
positions that interact with the DNA bases (Supplementary Material
and Supplementary Fig. 1).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

3.1 Prediction of functional regions in the protein

PatchFinder uses as input the protein structure (or a model) and a
multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of the query protein and its
sequence homologs. The MSA is generated automatically using
the procedure implemented in ConSurf—DB (Goldenberg et al.,
2009). PatchFinder searches for statistically signiﬁcant clusters
of evolutionarily conserved residues on the protein surface (ML-
patches), which often correspond to the functional regions in
proteins (Nimrod et al. , 2008). When only a few sequence homologs
are available for the query protein, the conservation signal cannot
be calculated reliably and the functional region is not predicted. In
such cases, the iDBPs server uses a classiﬁer that was trained on the
global features alone.

3.2 The classiﬁer’s input features

The features calculated for the ML-patches are: average surface
electrostatic potential, secondary structure content, patch size
(number of residues) and cluster-based amino acid conservation
patterns (Nimrod et al., 2009).

The global features include the average electrostatic potential, the
secondary structure content and the protein size. They also include
the protein’s dipole moment, its amino acid composition, the spatial
asymmetry of residues within the protein structure (Szilagyi and
Skolnick, 2006) and the fraction of hydrogen donors/acceptors on
the protein surface.

3.3 The web server

The web server requires the user to upload a protein structure in
PDB format (or provide the PDB id), indicate the chain identiﬁer of
the query proteins and provide an e—mail address (optional). Once
the calculations are ﬁnished, the results are sent to the user and
include the prediction score as well as the expected sensitivity and
precision at this score cutoff as calculated on the extended dataset.
When available, a link to the PatchFinder results is also supplied.

The PatchFinder results include the MSA, the evolutionary rates
computed for each position in the protein (Mayrose et al., 2004),
the list of residues composing the ML-patch and the conﬁdence of
the prediction. In addition, the user can also visualize the ML—patch
on the 3D-structure of the protein using the FirstGlance in J mol
applet.

3.4 Update of the N-Func database

The procedure we used to gather the structures in N—Func is
described in detail in the original publication with the following
modiﬁcations: sequence homologs were collected and multiply
aligned using the protocol of the ConSurf—DB server (Goldenberg
et al., 2009) on the UniProt database (Bairoch et al., 2005).

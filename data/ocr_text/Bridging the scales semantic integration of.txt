ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological reality can in silico only be comprehensively
represented in multi-scaled models. To this end, cell behavioural
models addressing the multi-cellular level have to be semantically
linked with mechanistic molecular models. These requirements have
to be met by flexible software workflows solving the issues of different
time scales, inter-model variable referencing and flexible sub-model
embedding.

Results: We developed a novel software workflow (EPISIM) for the
semantic integration of Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)-
based quantitative models in multi-scaled tissue models and simula-
tions. This workflow allows to import and access SBML-based
models. SBML model species, reactions and parameters are seman-
tically integrated in cell behavioural models (CBM) represented by
graphical process diagrams. By this, cellular states like proliferation
and differentiation can be flexibly linked to gene-regulatory or bio-
chemical reaction networks. For a multi-scale agent-based tissue
simulation executable code is automatically generated where different
time scales of imported SBML models and CBM have been mapped.
We demonstrate the capabilities of the novel software workflow by
integrating Tyson’s cell cycle model in our model of human epidermal
tissue homeostasis. Finally, we show the semantic interplay of the
different biological scales during tissue simulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many systems biological models have been developed in the past
years. The vast majority of these models focus exclusively on the
sub-cellular or the cellular level, whereas only a minority are
really multi-scaled (Andasari et al., 2012; Hoehme et al., 2010;
Osborne et al., 2010; Owen et al., 2009; Munaron and Scianna,
2012). However, semantic linking of systems biological scales
with models on sub-cellular, cellular and tissue level is a

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

prerequisite for a truly comprehensive in silico representation
of biological reality (Scianna and Preziosi, 2012). Although intra-
cellular molecular processes are frequently represented by
ordinary differential equation (ODE) systems, on the multi-
cellular level, more abstract descriptions of cell behaviour like
process diagrams are used (Amirkroll et al., 2008; Sﬁtterlin et al.,
2009). Semantic linking connects both modelling approaches by
flexibly mapping time scales, cross-referencing of model variables
and by this linking of cellular states like proliferation and differ-
entiation to molecular processes. Thereby, the mapping of
time-scales enables model integration and re-use without the ne-
cessity of reparameterization.

Databases like BioModels provide a huge variety of mainly
sub-cellular models for download (Le Novere et al., 2006).
Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) is the most com-
monly used standard for this kind of quantitative models repre-
senting biochemical reaction or gene-regulatory networks. This
standard is supported by >200 different software packages
(Hucka et al., 2003; Hucka and Le Novere, 2010) like
CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2003) and COPASI (complex
pathway simulator) (Hoops et al., 2006). However, almost
none of these packages directly support building multi-scaled,
multi-cellular tissue models and simulations, respectively.
COPASI has previously been used in a hard-coded tissue simu-
lation integrating TGF-ﬂl (transforming growth factor) signal-
ling in epidermal wound healing (Sun et al., 2009). A software
workflow allowing ﬂexible semantic integration of SBML
models has to be established to make use of the valuable
source of SBML-based models in a multi-scaled tissue modelling
context. Such a workﬂow has to hide the technical complexity of
realizing multi-scaled models and particularly model simulations
to address a rather biologically than computationally skilled
community. The software CompuCell3D (Andasari et al.,
2012; Swat et al., 2009) allows to directly reference and simulate
SBML-based models within a multi-cellular tissue simulation.
However, CompuCell3D models are manually built with exten-
sible mark-up language (XML)-f11es and Python scripts requiring
dedicated knowledge of these computer science-related concepts.
To our knowledge, there is no intuitive and user-friendly soft-
ware workﬂow available to semantically link and integrate
models on different scales to a multi-cellular tissue model with-
out any kind of coding.

We previously introduced the EPISIM platform as a graphical
cell behavioural modelling and tissue simulation workﬂow
(Si'ltterlin et al., 2009). Here, we extend our work towards a plat-
form allowing direct semantic integration of SBML-based
sub-cellular and graphical cell behavioural models. (i) We imple-
mented an SBML model importer for our graphical modelling
system (GMS). (ii) The GMS was moreover extended by a graph-
ical editor for SBML model species, parameters and reactions.
Any SBML model item can be directly referenced and manipu-
lated in a graphical cell behavioural model (CBM). This allows
building a conceptual semantic model link between the biological
scales. (iii) To realize the according technical link, we built a code
generator for automatic generation of a model connector software
component (MCC). MCC connects a cell’s multi-agent-based
CBM simulation with an imported SBML model’s time course
simulation. MCC handles multi-directional dataﬂow and map-
ping of the different model time scales. (iv) COPASI was inte-
grated in our simulation environment (SE) for time course
simulation of imported quantitative SBML-based models.

We demonstrate the capabilities of the new software workﬂow
by importing and semantically integrating Tyson’s cell cycle
model (Tyson, 1991) in our model of human epidermal tissue
homeostasis (Grabe and Neuber, 2005, 2007). We directly link
cellular states like proliferation and differentiation to the behav-
iour of Tyson’s model. Finally, we show the semantic interplay
between the sub-cellular and the cell behavioural model in the
tissue simulation.

2 METHODS

GMS is a set of J ava-based plug-ins for the open source software plat-
form Eclipse. The GMS is subdivided in four independent components:
(i) Variable-Sheet Editor; (ii) Graphical Model Editor (GME); (iii)
Function Library; and (iv) SBML Model Editor (SBME). Components
(i)—(iii) have been described earlier (Siitterlin et al., 2009). The new SBME
component (iv) was designed using the Uniﬁed Modelling Language
(UML) (Supplements S1). The resulting model represents an Ecore
meta-model of those parts of an imported SBML model that should be
made accessible by the SBME. The Eclipse Modelling Framework (EMF)
is used to generate large parts of the SBME’s source code based on the
aforementioned Ecore meta-model (Gamma and Beck, 2004; Moore
et al., 2004).

SBML model ﬁles to be imported are parsed using the library J SBML
[Fig. 1a (1)] offering purely J ava—based data structures to read, write and
manipulate SBML ﬁles (Drager et al., 2011). An imported SBML model’s
species, parameters and reactions are stored in a separate ﬁle in the
XML-Metadata Interchange (XMI) format being an open standard of
the Object Management Group. This standard is the SBME’s required
input format. The original SBML ﬁle remains unchanged. Graphical
CBMs are translated into executable code by our EPISIM code generator
(Siitterlin et al., 2009). This code is stored together with the SBML ﬁles in
a model archive.

Such a model archive can be loaded and executed by our multi-agent-
based graphical SE. SE is built on top of the simulation framework
MASON (Multi Agent Simulation Of Neighborhoods) (Luke, 2005).
We integrated COPASI as a plug-in for our SE (Fig. 1a). COPASI is
used for deterministic time course simulations (LSODA solver) of im-
ported SBML models (Hoops et al., 2006). The multi—scale tissue simu-
lations for determining the computation time per simulation step with
and without optimization were run on an Intel(R) Core(TM) i7-2600
processor (3.4GHz, 8 GB random access memory).

3 SOFTWARE WORKFLOW

The newly developed software workﬂow (Fig. la) allows graph-
ical modelling and simulation of cellular behaviour in tissues on
multiple scales. This software workﬂow consists of two ready to
use software tools: (i) the GMS called EPISIM Modeller and (ii)
the SE called EPISIM Simulator. Quantitative SBML models
mostly representing biochemical reaction or gene-regulatory net-
works can be imported by the GMS (Section 3.1). Using the
SBME and GME, an imported SBML model’s species, param-
eters and reactions can be directly referenced in a CBM and by
that semantically integrated into cellular decisions and a cell’s
behaviour, respectively [Fig.lb (4), (6)]. CBMs are automatically
translated into executable code with the EPISIM code generator.
Moreover, a MCC linking the multi-agent-based tissue simula-
tion with the SBML model time course simulation is generated
(Section 3.2). The code is stored together with the imported
SBML ﬁles in a model archive, which in turn is loaded by the
SE. The resulting multi-scale agent-based tissue simulation is
subdivided in three steps: (i) SBML model time course simula-
tion; (ii) CBM simulation; and (iii) biomechanical model simu-
lation. In this work, we focus on steps (i) and (ii) (Section 3.2).

3.1 SBML model import

The GMS allows importing an unlimited number of quantitative
SBML-based models into a CBM project. The import process
has ﬁve consecutive steps: (i) parsing of the SBML ﬁle; (ii) ex-
traction of all species, parameters and reactions; (iii) conversion
of local parameters to global parameters; (iv) elimination of
namespace conﬂicts; and (v) storage of the extracted elements
in a separate ﬁle (Supplementary Movie M1). Only information
contained in the SBME’s data model (Supplements S1) is ex-
tracted from an SBML ﬁle. Reactions are named ﬂuxes in the
SBME [Fig. 1b (4)], as only a reaction’s ﬂux can be referenced in
a CBM. A reaction’s local parameters are converted into global
ones, as each parameter should be unambiguously accessible
within a CBM. If local parameters exist, concerned reactions in
the imported SBML ﬁle are automatically changed. Otherwise,
the original SBML ﬁle remains unchanged. The SBML ﬁles are
copied into the model archive during translation of the graphical
CBMs into executable code. Each name of a species, parameter
or reaction must be unique, as otherwise an unambiguous refer-
ence in a CBM would not be possible. This general requirement
can lead to namespace conﬂicts when importing multiple SBML-
based models. Those conﬂicts are eliminated by adding a num-
bered sufﬁx to duplicate names. Additionally, the preﬁx ‘sbml_’
is added to each name. The original name is kept as a separate
property visible in the SBME. Namespace conﬂicts arising
during the conversion of local into global parameters are elimi-
nated accordingly.

3.2 Model simulation and time scale mapping

COPASI was integrated in the SE for multi-agent-based tissue
simulations. The SE loads a model archive compiled by the
GMS, and each cell holds a reference to an instance of the
coded CBM. The model archive, moreover, contains imported
SBML model ﬁles. These ﬁles are loaded by COPASI providing
one instance of each model for time course simulation. A tissue

Fig. 1. (a) EPISIM multi-scale modelling and simulation software workﬂow. (1) Graphical CBMs are created with EPISIM GMS, which is able to
import SBML-based models. The imported model’s species, reactions and parameters can be directly referenced, and thus semantically integrated in a
CBM. (2) CBMs are translated into executable code by the EPISIM code generator and stored in a model archive together with the imported SBML ﬁles.
(3) The model archive is loaded by the SE built using the framework MASON and the software COPASI. MASON offers the infrastructure for a
multi—agent tissue simulation based on a CBM. COPASI loads the imported SBML models and runs an individual time course simulation for each
SBML model and each cell in the simulated tissue. (b) EPISIM Modeller (GMS), (4) SBME, (5) an SBML model’s properties and time course simulation

parameters and (6) GME for CBM speciﬁcation

simulation step can be subdivided in two consecutive sub-steps
for each cell: (i) time course simulation of each imported SBML
model and (ii) simulation of one CBM time step. Thereby, the
CBM simulation uses the results computed in sub-step (i).

The semantic link between simulation sub-step (i) and (ii) re-
quires a mapping of the model time scales. As depicted in
Figure 2, the clock frequency of the multi-cellular tissue simula-
tion causes the assumption of an atomic time step for a CBM
here denoted Atcbm. The SBML model’s simulation time Atsbml
denotes the model’s time-unit (e.g. hours). An SBML model’s
mapped time tmapped then corresponds to the time interval simu-
lated by COPASI for each tissue simulation step Atcbm. To cal-
culate tmapped, the modeller has to determine semantically
equivalent time periods tsem_cbm in the CBM and tsem_sbm1 in
the SBML model. Such periods can be the cell cycle time in
the CBM and the according time in the semantically linked
SBML-based cell cycle model (Section 4.1).

COPASI numerically calculates npoints time points subdividing
tmapped in the time course simulation. The interval between two

time points in an SBML model’s time course simulation Atpoint
can be calculated according to equation 2.

l‘ d
Al‘point = m 

points

The value of Atpoint has to be sufﬁciently small for an accurate
numerical time course simulation of a particular SBML-based
model. Too small values lead to an unnecessary increase of com-
putation time without improving the simulation accuracy. An
optimal value for npoims has to be determined depending on
the kinetics of SBML model. The GMS allows individual setting
of tmapped (No Of Time Units Per Simstep) and npoints (No Of
Points Per CBM Simstep) for each imported SBML model
[Fig. lb (5)]. These values are passed on to COPASI.

A MCC is automatically generated by the GMS to link the
multi—agent—based tissue simulation of CBMs with the time
course simulation of imported SBML models (Fig. 2). MCC is
the mediator between both kinds of models, and it enables the
semantic interplay during the simulation:

Fig. 2. Each tissue simulation step corresponds to one simulation step in
each cell’s CBM instance. Moreover, one simulation step represents the
atomic model time Atcbm. This atomic time has to be mapped to the
semantically equivalent time tmapped in an SBML model’s time course
simulation. An SBML model’s basic time interval resulting from the
chosen time unit (e.g. hours) is denoted by Atsbml. The time tmapped is
calculated based on the two time intervals tsem_cbm and tsem_sbm1, repre-
senting semantically equivalent periods from a biological perspective. In
the given example, these time periods as well as the atomic times differ.
Hence, 0.5h in the tissue simulation is mapped to 0.75h in the SBML
model simulation. The time mapping as well as bi-directional data ﬂow is
facilitated by an automatically generated MCC

0 Administration of SBML model simulation states: each im-
ported SBML model is only loaded once by COPASI. A
single SBML model instance is used for all cells. A data
structure stores an SBML model’s time course simulation
state after each simulation step. The MCC administers all
time course simulation states of all imported SBML models
for all cells.

0 Initialization of time course simulations: if the tissue simula-
tion contains m cells at simulation step n, we need m indi-
vidual time course simulations of the same SBML model.
MCC reinitializes COPASI after each simulation step. The
SBML model state of tissue simulation step n-I is the initial
time course simulation state of simulation step n.

0 Enable access to time course simulation results: In a graphical
CBM, each species’ concentration, each parameter’s value
and each reaction’s ﬂux can be referenced and modiﬁed.
This enables the semantic integration of both modelling
levels. Technically, this bi-directional dataﬂow is realized
by the automatically generated MCC. The MCC serves as

a data pipe between CBM instances and the according
SBML model simulation states.

0 Mapping of original names to unique names: as described in
Section 3.1, the name of a species, parameter or reaction is
converted to a unique name when an SBML model is im-
ported. The SBML model ﬁle used for time course simula-
tion by COPASI remains unchanged. MCC maps the
original names to the unique names and vice versa.

Wrapping COPASI with the MCC also allows the user to
store the SBML simulation results together with the CBM
states in a simulation snapshot ﬁle at chosen time points. A
tissue simulation can be fully resumed by loading a snapshot
serving as simulation starting point (Supplementary Movie
M7). Finally, the MCC can switch an SBML model’s time
course simulation for a particular cell on or off for saving com-
putation time. Depending on a cell’s ‘type’ or ‘differentiation
stage’, the simulation of a certain SBML model might semantic-
ally not be relevant. The GMS’s function library offers the com-
mand SbmlSim { ‘sbmlIa”, mode) to control an SBML model’s
simulation mode.

3.3 Workﬂow generality

The introduced EPISIM software workﬂow provides a ready to
use, out-of-the-box software solution in contrast to dedicated
software development frameworks like Chaste (Pitt-Francis
et al., 2009). EPISIM targets a community without extensive
computational skills. Hence, we designed and implemented
easy to use computer programs that hide the technical complex-
ity of realizing multi-scale models and simulations. Out of the
box computer programs providing a graphical user interface can
hardly compete with programming frameworks in terms of ﬂexi-
bility and generality. Nevertheless, the EPISIM workﬂow or
parts of it can be either transferred or re-used within other
SEs. The GMS can be linked to a totally different SE like
CompuCell3D, as the graphical CBMs are not directly translated
into Java code. In an intermediate step, a programming language
independent, XML-based model representation is generated.
This representation in turn is used to generate Java code using
Extensible Stylesheet Language (XSL) transformation. By
exchanging the XSL transformation style sheet, translation into
any programming language can be realized. As the generated
Java code does not include components of the multi-agent frame-
work MASON, one can re-use and transfer the introduced
MCC-based link to COPASI in another J ava-based multi-agent
SE with reasonable time and effort. Finally, the Java-based
EPISIM SE intends to integrate novel biomechanical models
besides those that are already available. This requires the imple-
mentation of the chosen method in Java using a given interface.
The connector, used to link a graphical CBM to the biomechan—
ical model, can be automatically generated.

4 RESULTS

To demonstrate the capabilities of our newly developed
multi-scale tissue modelling and simulation workﬂow, we seman-
tically integrated Tyson’s cell cycle model (Tyson, 1991) in our in
graphical CBM of epidermal homeostasis (Grabe and Neuber,

Bridging the scales: semantic integration of quantitative SBML

 

2005, 2007; Siitterlin et al., 2009). To this end, we imported both
the 2 variable and the 6 variable version of Tyson’s model with
our GMS [Fig. lb (4)]. Both versions of the SBML model ﬁles
were obtained from BioModels database (Le Novere et al.,
2006). The 2 variable model version was semantically integrated
in our graphical CBM. We, therefore, completely remodelled our
epidermal CBM’s cell cycle sub-model (Section 4.1) and parts of
our cell differentiation sub-model (Section 4.2). The 6 variable
model version was imported to show the GMS’s automatic elim-
ination of namespace conﬂicts (Section 3.1) and the MCC’s cap-
abilities (Section 3.2) to handle multiple imported SBML models.
Finally, we ran a multi-scale agent-based tissue simulation with
the SE to demonstrate the semantic interplay of SBML-based
sub-cellular models and graphical CBM’s in a multi-cellular con-
text (Section 4.3).

The whole multi-scale workﬂow is illustrated by a series of
supplementary movies (Supplementary Movie M1—M7). The
graphical modelling language is described in Supplements S2.
The software tools and all modelling projects or simulation
data used in the movies can be downloaded from the supple-
ments website.

4.1 Cell cycle model

We remodelled the cell cycle sub-model of our CBM of epider-
mal homeostasis. After importing Tyson’s 2 variable cell cycle
model with the GMS, we semantically integrated the model’s
readout (Fig. 3 and Supplements M2). Tyson’s mathematical
model of cdc2 and cyclin interaction is able to operate in the
three modes (i) steady state with high maturation promoting
factor (MPF) activity; (ii) spontaneous oscillator; or (iii) excit-
able switch. We associated mode (ii) with cell division cycles in
stem cells and transit amplifying (TA) cells. Mode (i) is used in
no longer proliferating but differentiated spinosum and

Fig. 3. Semantic integration of Tyson’s cell cycle model in a graphical
CBM. The condition for cell division holds if the active MPF (sbml_u)
concentration exceeds threshold MT (1) and the minimum time
MIN_AGE_DELT A between two cell divisions has elapsed (2). A cell
also divides if it went into cell cycle arrest in one of the previous simu-
lation steps (3). After saving the cell’s age at cell division (4), the mitosis
submodel (5) responsible for cell division is called

granulosum cells (Section 4.2). The SBML model species
sbml_u corresponds to concentration of active MPF relative to
cdc2. Cells divide at a signiﬁcantly high active MPF concentra-
tion modelled by exceeding mitotic threshold (MT) [Fig. 3 (1)].
We deﬁned a minimum period MIN_AGE_DEL TA between two
cell divisions, avoiding multiple cell divisions in consecutive
simulation steps [Fig. 3 (2)]. The whole condition represents a
semantic link between a sub-cellular model and a cell behav-
ioural decision. A proliferating cell goes into cell cycle arrest in
case of too high cell density in its microenvironment. In such a
case of high external pressure, cell division is delayed and is
Mitotic is set to true (T) in the mitosis sub-model. This triggers
cell division in one of the following simulation steps [Fig. 3 (3)].

With default parameterization from BioModels database,
Tyson’s model yields an active MPF concentration peak every
35 time units interpreted as hours in our case (Atsbmlz l h).
Threshold MT is reached every 34.2 h. In our epidermis model,
a proliferating cell divides every 60 h. The CBMs atomic time
interval is Atcbm=0.5 h. With tsem_sbm1= 34.2h and
tsem_cbm= 60 h, the mapped time tmapped is 0.285h for this
SBML model. We set npoimsz l, as resulting Atpoim is 0.285 h.
This is sufﬁciently small for an accurate time course simulation
of Tyson’s model.

4.2 Cell differentiation model

In our model of human epidermis (Grabe and Neuber, 2005), we
distinguish proliferating (stem cells, TA cells) and differentiating
(spinosum and granulosum cells) keratinocytes. The cell differ-
entiation sub-model (Supplements S4) links sub-cellular model
behaviour to cell states. TA cells differentiate to early spinosum
cells depending on their age. TA cell differentiation to early
spinosum cells corresponds to a cell state transition from prolif-
eration to differentiation. Tyson’s cell cycle model can operate in
three modes. The model’s parameter k6 (named sbml_k6 after
import) can be used to change between these modes. By setting
sbml_k6 :2, the model behaviour changes from oscillation to
steady state. Hence, proliferation stops, as cell division is trig-
gered by high active MPF concentrations, and threshold MT is
never reached.

4.3 Multi—scale tissue simulation

To demonstrate the semantic interplay of the imported sub-cel-
lular SBML model and the CBM, we compiled a model archive
with the GMS. The SE runs a multi-scale agent-based tissue
simulation based on the loaded model archive (Supplementary
Movies M5—M7). A CBM is per default linked with 2D biomech-
anical model (Grabe and Neuber, 2005). Supplementary Movie
M6 shows how a graphical CBM can be connected to the 3D
version of this biomechanical model. Depending on the linked
biomechanical model, the SE automatically starts a 2D or 3D
tissue simulation. SE allows generating charts for real-time moni-
toring of single cells or the tissue as a whole. Figure 4a shows the
time course simulation results of Tyson’s cell cycle model within
a stem cell. Stem cells are initialized with a random age avoiding
synchronized cell behaviour. SE initializes imported SBML
models according to this random initial age [Fig. 4a (1)]. We
used tmapped=0285 for the imported cell cycle model and
observed active MPF (U) peaks every 60h in stem cells.

Fig. 4. Semantic interplay between sub-cellular and cellular model behaviour during tissue simulation. (a) Oscillation between high and low active MPF
concentrations (U) within a monitored stem cell. Stem cells are initialized with a random age (1) before simulation. Cell division is triggered when mitotic
threshold MT is reached. (b) The monitored TA cell differentiates to an early spinosum cell after one cell division (2). This corresponds on the
sub-cellular level to a transition of Tyson’s cell cycle model from oscillating to steady-state behaviour

This sub-cellular model behaviour triggers cell division by ex-
ceeding threshold MT. The transition from cell proliferation to
cell differentiation is semantically linked to a change from oscil-
lating to steady-state model behaviour on the sub-cellular level
[Fig. 4b (2)]. After one cell division, a TA cell differentiates to an
early spinosum cell, which no longer proliferates because of the
steady state of Tyson’s cell cycle model [Fig. 4b (2)].

We optimized the computation time per tissue simulation step
using the command SbmlSim. The regular computation time per
tissue simulation step is almost eight times higher than the opti-
mized computation time in a 2D tissue simulation and more than
six times higher in a 3D tissue simulation. Independent of
optimization, the time per tissue simulation step increases lin-
early with an increasing cell number. Further details regarding
computation time optimization and the parallelization of simu-
lations using the SE on a computer cluster are included in
Supplements S3.

5 DISCUSSION

We developed and introduced the ﬁrst entirely graphical
multi-scale cell behavioural modelling and simulation software
workﬂow that semantically links the sub-cellular and cellular
level in tissue simulations. Semantic linking comprises ﬂexible
mapping of time scales, enabling of bi-directional model variable
access and by this linking of general cellular states like prolifer-
ation and differentiation to molecular processes and vice versa.

Cellular behaviour is graphically modelled with process dia-
grams. An unlimited number of quantitative SBML-based
models can be imported with the GMS. This enables a semantic
integration of sub-cellular in cell behavioural models. We inte-
grated COPASI in the SE for calculating deterministic time
course simulations of the imported SBML models for each indi-
vidual cell. An automatically generated MCC handles the data
ﬂow between sub-cellular and cell behavioural models during
tissue simulation. Time course simulation states can be stored
together with the overall tissue simulation state in a simulation

snapshot. Based on such snapshot, a tissue simulation can be
fully resumed. Moreover, this enables archiving, re—using and
exchanging of tissue simulation results among users of the SE.
Simulation snapshots allow rerunning a published tissue simula-
tion that goes far beyond the information conveyed by a simu-
lation movie. However, the lack of a commonly accepted
standard for representing cell-based models as well as the accord-
ing simulation results hinders the exchange of both, models and
results, between different existing modelling and simulation en-
vironments. Such a standard is in our view the prerequisite for
realizing re—usable and ready to run multi-scale models in a fash-
ion that is comparable with sub-cellular models using SBML.

To demonstrate the applicability of our software workﬂow, we
imported the SBML version of Tyson’s well known 2 variable
cell cycle model with the GMS. In our model of epidermal
homeostasis, we linked the imported sub-cellular model with
the cellular states proliferation and differentiation. Cell division
in proliferating keratinocytes is controlled by the active MPF
concentration modelled on the sub-cellular level. In turn, the
behaviour of Tyson’s model is coupled to a keratinocyte’s differ-
entiation stage on the cellular level. By this, we were able to
demonstrate a bi-directional semantic link between the sub-cel-
lular and cellular modelling and simulation level. Additionally,
we demonstrated the automatic elimination of namespace con-
ﬂicts by importing the 6 variable version of Tyson’s.

For both model versions, the SBML model time units could be
successfully mapped to the required CBM time steps. This shows
that with the developed workﬂow, SBML models can be re-used
in a context requiring a different time scale without
re—parameterizing the SBML model. One might argue that
such a mapping of semantically equivalent periods should not
be necessary. But actually, the necessity of directly manipulating
parameters of an ODE-based model would contradict our initial
requirement of re—usability of SBML models. Moreover, we see
time mapping as a valuable technique for model synchronization
and simpler multi-scale model integration. Finally, we demon-
strated that the SE is able to administer time course simulations

Bridging the scales: semantic integration of quantitative SBML

 

of multiple imported quantitative SBML models. The SE suc-
cessfully handled >9000 individual time course simulations per
tissue simulation step in the 3D simulation. The computation
time per simulation step increases linearly for increasing cell
numbers independent of optimization by the modeller.
Moreover, this indicates the power of the EPISIM code gener-
ator and the approach of automatically translating graphical
CBMs into highly efﬁcient and optimized executable code
(Siitterlin et al., 2009).

Our software workﬂow allows graphically building multi-
scaled models without any coding. This is a unique approach
compared with other available systems (Andasari et al., 2012;
Pitt-Francis et al., 2009). The available model elements
(Supplements S2) of the graphical modelling language allow de-
terministic, stochastic or hybrid modelling. Even continuous
models can be manually integrated (Supplements S3). A11 control
structures of a programming language like branching based on
conditions or values are available. Loops are automatically
induced when neighbouring cells are referenced. Graphical
CBMs are linked to a hard coded biomechanical model provided
by the SE. This modularization into biomechanical and cell be-
havioural models is not necessarily a limitation. Moreover, it
allows re—using one and the same CBM in 2D and 3D as demon-
strated. The integration of new biomechanical models in the SE
is explicitly intended. Furthermore, the GMS could be adopted
and connected to other simulation environments like
CompuCell3D with manageable workload. The GMS as well
as the SE hides to a large extent the technical complexity of
modelling and simulating cellular behaviour in a tissue context.
Furthermore, the separation of technical complexity and systems
biological model complexity is in our view a key requirement for
building highly complex multi-scale models. This is the main
lesson learned from the ﬁeld of software engineering where
model driven architectures are analogous. This complexity sep-
aration fosters the creation of more complex truly multi-scaled
models by not computer but rather biologically skilled scientists.

Public databases like BioModels provide complete
ready-to-run SBML models (Hucka and Le Novere, 2010).
With our novel software workﬂow, we established a link to
this large and up to now unexploited potential for building
multi-scale models in a multi-cellular context. To come up with
more realistic and consequently more complex biological models,
it is inevitable to rely on an existing, ready to use model base,
instead of starting from scratch solely based on literature.
However, this requires that increasingly sub-cellular models are
developed with a focus on the functional, behavioural change of
cells. Such models could be models of cell decision for prolifer-
ation, differentiation, migration or apoptosis. This currently in
literature underrepresented aspect is in our view an essential pre-
requisite for building higher complexity models. In this context,
our multi-scale workﬂow motivates the integration of existing
models or the creation of novel ones. In consequence, we
expect this to be the route to more holistic models of larger bio-
logical systems.

ABSTRACT

Summary: RegaDB is a free and open source data management and
analysis environment for infectious diseases. RegaDB allows clinicians
to store, manage and analyse patient data, including viral genetic se-
quences. Moreover, RegaDB provides researchers with a mechanism
to collect data in a uniform format and offers them a canvas to make
newly developed bioinformatics tools available to clinicians and virolo-
gists through a user friendly interface.

Availability and implementation: Source code, binaries and
documentation are available on http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/regadb.
RegaDB is written in the Java programming language, using a web-
service-oriented architecture.

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in infectious diseases research require efﬁcient collab-
oration and exchange of clinical and Virological data.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Researchers need access to large amounts of data to test hypoth-
eses or extract valuable information through data mining (Sloot
et al., 2008, 2009). For this purpose, RegaDB was developed as a
free and open source data management and analysis environ-
ment for infectious diseases (Libin et al., 2007).

RegaDB runs on Windows, Linux or Mac OS X. The system
can be installed within a hospital or institute so that the data
stays within the clinical environment. RegaDB follows the idea
of an integrated environment for bioinformatics analysis, such as
the Genetic Data Environment (de Oliveira et al., 2003), ViroLab
(Assel et al., 2009) and Geneious (Drummond et al., 2011). The
difference is that RegaDB uses a relational database, and can be
locally or remotely accessed. This allows RegaDB to be used for
clinical management and/ or research in one locality or for long-
term data-sharing collaborations between different institutes.

2 DATABASE STRUCTURE AND TOOLS

RegaDB’s database enforces the data abstraction paradigm
(Fig. 1). This approach ensures ﬂexibility, as the database can
be conveniently extended as needed without upgrading its
schema in most of the cases (Imbrechts et al., 2009). All abstract
data entities are connected to a central patient entity, including

Fig. 1. An overview of RegaDB’s database entities and functionalities

attributes, tests, events, therapies and viral isolates. Attributes
annotate a patient with information, which is typically of a clin-
ical or epidemiological nature, e. g. the gender or transmission
risk group. RegaDB implements tests as values that are obtained
at a given moment in time, i.e. there is only one date associated
with it. The results can be in vivo or in vitro measurements, ap-
pointments, as well as computational results obtained from a
web service. General tests are used to store data extracted from
patient samples, e. g. cell counts and viral loads. Tests can also be
linked to viral isolates, e.g. typing and subtyping results, to
drugs, e. g. therapeutic drug monitoring, or to a combination of
an isolate and a drug, e.g. phenotypic and genotypic resistance
interpretations. Events cover a speciﬁc time interval in the pa-
tient’s history, i.e. have a start and end date, e. g. AIDS-deﬁning
illnesses or pregnancy. The default list of attributes, tests and
events available in the system can be extended via the user inter-
face. In this way, RegaDB can be tailored to the user’s needs or
research interests. Attributes, tests and events are annotated with
a data type (numbers, strings, nominal values, etc.), which allows
the user interface and data access layer to maintain data integ-
rity. The therapy entity allows users to store the medication his-
tory of a patient. A single therapy consists of a start date, a stop
date and a combination of drugs, i.e. a regimen, which the users
can select from a list of both generic and commercial drug
names. When the therapy has a stop date, the clinician can in-
dicate a reason for ending or switching the treatment, e. g. resist-
ance, side effects or adherence issues.

A viral isolate contains one or more nucleotide sequences,
allowing multiple sequences extracted from one viral genome
to be grouped together. Once an isolate is added to RegaDB,
the corresponding pathogen is determined by invoking a web
service that implements a BLAST search procedure (Altschul
et al., 1990). When RegaDB supports the pathogen, the appro-
priate reference sequence is loaded and used to perform a codon—
correct alignment with frame-shift detection and correction. The
alignment procedure ﬁnds the protein reading frames encoded by
the sequences that make up the isolate. This information, to-
gether with all detected point mutations, insertions and deletions,
is stored in the database. The alignment web service implements
the Needleman—Wunsch algorithm in C++ (Needleman and
Wunsch, 1970) to analyse large sequences efﬁciently.

Depending on the pathogen determination returned by the web
service, the viral isolate is directed to a typing web service
(Alcantara et al., 2009; de Oliveira et al., 2005) and/or resistance
interpretation web service (Liu and Shafer, 2006). Table 1 shows
detailed information on reference sequences and bioinformatics
tools available for the supported pathogens. RegaDB supports
the use of bioinformatics tools published on the web as web
services.

All data can be viewed and edited through a web-based inter-
face. Key parameters of a patient’s clinical history are visualized
in a patient chart as a time-line annotated with viral loads, CD4
counts, regimens and viral isolate time points. RegaDB can
export patient details into a report document by replacing vari-
ables in a user-designed RTF template.

Several tools are already available or are being developed,
some of which by the users. Drug resistance interpretation can
be performed according to several algorithms. For HIV, various
versions of the Stanford algorithms (HIde, Liu and Shafer,
2006), the Rega algorithms 0/ an Laethem et al., 2002) and the
ANRS algorithms (Meynard et al., 2002) are implemented. For
each algorithm, a cumulative overview is available, whereby re-
sistance detected in a patient is taken forward to the last sample.
Evolution of a virus isolate is tabulated as amino acid changes
compared with the previous isolate from the same patient.
Another tool allows plotting a phylogenetic tree constructed
from a set of sequences with a pre-deﬁned similarity to a query
sequence. To ensure the quality of the sequence database, a tool
was developed that can be used to ﬂag potential contaminations,
errors in sampling or data entry, super infection or transmission
chains, by detecting unusual intra- or inter-patient evolutionary
distances.

Attributes are synchronized with a central repository to ensure
compatibility between different RegaDB instances. The central
repository contains a collection of standardized data ﬁelds and
corresponding values such as demographic information (country
of origin, transmission risk group, etc.), test results (viral load,
cell count, etc.) and drug names (both generic and commercial).
In addition, this repository also provides access to the latest ver-
sions of drug resistance algorithms. Compatibility functionalities
allow the system to be updated, with minimal effort, as new
content becomes available.

3 OPPORTUNITIES FOR RESEARCHERS

When the development of RegaDB started, several custom-made
databases were available that allowed users to enter ambiguous
representations of data, for example, different representations for
the same medical compound. However, to facilitate efﬁcient data
exchange and to make the execution of aggregate queries pos-
sible, it is important that data are available in a structured
format. By providing support for explicit data types and enfor-
cing these data types through the user interface, RegaDB circum-
vents many difﬁculties that might complicate the exchange of
data.

RegaDB allows data to be exported in XML format from
local data sources (hospitals, institutes), and these exports can
be combined in a research database.

Data from other databases can be imported via a generic
import tool. RegaDB also provides a programming interface,

which can be used to develop custom import programs to sup-
port more complicated data sources. A procedure to import data
encoded in the HICDEP (hicdep.org) format directly into
RegaDB is currently under development.

A research database will generally be accessed via the Internet;
therefore, authentication is an important security aspect.
RegaDB supports password-based authentication by default.
The authentication module abstraction allows for a straightfor-
ward implementation of alternative authentication back-ends
(OpenId, Kerberos, etc.), which makes it possible for RegaDB
to connect to existing user management systems. The application
will only allow registered users to access the system. Once
granted access to the system, a user is only able to access patient
information that belongs to a dataset connected to the user’s
proﬁle. The owner of the dataset can conﬁgure the access of
users to this dataset, and revoke the access after a certain analysis
or assignment is ﬁnished.

Researchers can query RegaDB using the visual query tool,
which allows users to deﬁne complex queries guided by a user
interface. Query deﬁnitions can be saved and re-run every time
an update of the data becomes available. Work is in progress to
support the use of predeﬁned SQL—based queries via the user
interface. Query results can be exported to a CSV and/or
FASTA ﬁle. It is possible to set-up an analysis workﬂow by
conﬁguring a query to execute a python post processing script.
If the script generates statistical data in a graphical format, this is
visualized in the query user interface after the query has been
executed.

When researchers make their tools available as web services,
they can be easily integrated in RegaDB, lowering the threshold
for clinicians and virologists to use such tools.

RegaDB has been used in several collaborations including the
Virolab EC project (virolab.org). Data from several European
hospitals were stored in one RegaDB instance, resulting in a
combined dataset of >8000 sequences. During the last phase of
the project, we were able to combine our efforts with another EC
project, EUResist (euresist.org), resulting in a combined data-
base of >55 000 sequences.

Another example of the utility of RegaDB is the collaborative
database used within the Southern African Treatment and
Resistance Network (SATuRN). This network has 24 member
institutions working in Southern Africa, the region at the
epicentre of the HIV epidemic. Currently there are >10 institu-
tions using the SATuRN RegaDB for patient data management,

data curation and research. Under SATuRN, >7000 genotypes
with treatment and monitoring data have been collected. Using
the built-in customized report and query functionality, data of
speciﬁc attributes are selected, analysed and used to answer spe-
ciﬁc clinical and research questions (de Oliveira et al., 2010;
Manasa et al., 2012). In addition, members of the SATuRN
project recently published a book (Rossouw et al., 2013) contain-
ing a series of case studies used for training. More than 1450
physicians and nurses have been trained through conferences,
workshops and online web-tutorials.

4 AVAILABILITY AND USAGE

RegaDB is a software application that can be downloaded from
the Internet and installed in a health care or research institute.
Documentation, source ﬁles and binaries are available on
http://rega.kuleuven.be/cev/regadb. Because of its modular and
ﬂexible design, RegaDB can be used in many different contexts
and settings, from managing patient data in a clinical environ-
ment to setting up large-scale research collaborations. Currently,
all RegaDB instances are private instances that can only be ac-
cessed by a restricted user base. Some of these instances are ac-
cessible on the Internet; others are only accessible from within
the institute’s intranet.

The current version of the software is already used for storing
genetic data of HIV-1, HIV-2, HTLV (Araujo et al., 2012) and
HCV isolates and related patient and clinical information.

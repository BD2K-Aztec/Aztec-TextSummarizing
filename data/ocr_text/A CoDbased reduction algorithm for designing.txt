ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene regulatory networks serve as models from which
to derive therapeutic intervention strategies, in particular, stationary
control policies over time that shift the probability mass of the steady
state distribution (SSD) away from states associated with undesirable
phenotypes. Derivation of control policies is hindered by the high-
dimensional state spaces associated with gene regulatory networks.
Hence, network reduction is a fundamental issue for intervention.
Results: The network model that has been most used for the study of
intervention in gene regulatory networks is the probabilistic Boolean
network (PBN), which is a collection of constituent Boolean networks
(BNs) with perturbation. In this article, we propose an algorithm
that reduces a BN with perturbation, designs a control policy on
the reduced network and then induces that policy to the original
network. The coefficient of determination (GOD) is used to choose
a gene for deletion, and a reduction mapping is used to rewire the
remaining genes. This COD-reduction procedure is used to construct
a reduced network, then either the previously proposed mean first-
passage time (M FPT) or SSD stationary control policy is designed on
the reduced network, and these policies are induced to the original
network. The efficacy of the overall algorithm is demonstrated on
networks of 10 genes or less, where it is possible to compare the
steady state shifts of the induced and original policies (because the
latter can be derived), and by applying it to a 17-gene gastrointestinal
network where it is shown that there is substantial beneficial steady
state shift.

dynamics (Datta et al., 2007). To address the issue of changing
the long—run behavior, stochastic control has been employed to
ﬁnd stationary control policies that affect a network’s steady state
distribution (SSD; Pal et al., 2006); however, owing to the inherent
computational complexity of optimal control methods (Akutsu
et al., 2007; Bertsekas, 2005), it is often infeasible to design
optimal control policies for large networks. A possible approach to
complexity reduction in the ﬁnite—horizon model is to use a discrete
linear model (Ng et al., 2006); however, we do not wish to be
constrained to a ﬁnite horizon or a linear model. We proceed in
the nonlinear case with network dynamics described by a Markov
chain. Even restricting ourselves to the Boolean model, where gene
states are binary, 0 and 1, if there are n genes in the network, then
there are 2” states and the transition probability matrix is of size
2” X 2” .

Given this level of complexity, even approximation via
re—inforcement learning (Faryabi et al., 2007) and greedy control
methods (Qian et al., 2009; Vahedi et al., 2008) are quite restricted in
the size of networks they can handle. For instance, rather than doing a
full optimization relative to some objective function and facing the
‘curse of dimensionality’ associated with dynamic programming,
greedy methods utilize statistical characteristics of the network,
including mean ﬁrst—passage times (MFPT; Vahedi et al., 2008) and
the SSD (Qian et al., 2009). But these still require manipulating the
transition probability matrix, which effectively limits their use to
not more that l3—gene networks using our current workstation
computing environment.

This article takes the approach of reducing the size of the network,
designing a control policy on the reduced network, and from this
inducing a control policy on the full network. It is motivated by
a previously proposed network reduction algorithm that removes
genes in such a way that the deleted gene induces a speciﬁc
collapsing of pairs of states from the state space of the original
network (Ivanov and Dougherty, 2004). A more detailed discussion
about the reduction mapping from that article and its comparison
to the current proposed algorithm for designing stationary control
policies is provided in the Supplementary Material. While other
reduction algorithms have been developed to obtain reduced models
for Boolean or probabilistic Boolean networks (PBNs) to maintain
either the structural consistency (Shmulevich and Dougherty, 2007)
or the dynamical behavior of the original network (Ivanov et al.,
2007), the speciﬁc intent in this article is to ﬁnd a reduction strategy

that can provide beneﬁcial stationary control policies for the original
network.

In this study, we use Boolean networks (BNs) with perturbation,
BNps, to model gene regulatory networks and ultimately design
stationary control policies to alter the dynamics of the network.
BNs have been used in variety of other contexts and with different
objectives in biological applications. Huang (2007) generates
Boolean gene regulatory networks for validating the hypothesis
that the attractors of such networks represent functional cellular
states, whereas Kauffman model (Kauffman, 1993) proposes that
the cell types are the attractors. He introduces randomization into
the networks in terms of environmental noise (random perturbation
of the individual genes) and mutation, which refers to changes in the
wiring of the network. In another prospective, BNs are claimed to
have biologically meaningful behavior when they are in the critical
phase (Kauffman, 1993). Ramo et al. (2006) study this phenomena
and discover that gene regulatory networks have stable, near critical,
dynamics. They also propose an analytical approximation of the size
distribution of perturbation avalanches for BNs using the branching
process. They test their analytical method with simulations using
different synthetic BNs and also a biological dataset. Random BNs
and their characteristics have been extensively studied by Aldana
et al. (2002). In a random BN, the average function indegrees are
constant and function outputs are assigned randomly. Serra et al.
(2004) study the effects of perturbation in the context of random
BNs by knocking out one gene. Additionally, the attractor structure
of BNps (Brun et al., 2005), inference of BNps (Yu et al., 2009), and
their use as models for gene regulation, in particular, intervention
in BNps (Dougherty et al., 2010; Qian and Dougherty, 2009), have
been studied.

Complexity reduction has been considered for other classes of
models, including discrete network models such as BNs (Ivanov and
Dougherty, 2004; Ivanov et al., 2007) or logical regulatory graphs
(Naldi et al., 2009), and continuous biochemical networks (Ball
et al., 2006; Borisov et al., 2005; Clarke, 1992; Conzelmann et al.,
2001, 2006; Gorban et al., 2006; Hartwell et al., 1999; Indic et al.,
2006; Radulescu et al., 2008; Saez—Rodriguez et al., 2005; Wang
et al., 2004). All past efforts focus on reducing the complexity
while preserving network dynamics, either by maintaining the
attractor structures as in discrete mathematical frameworks (Ivanov
et al., 2007; Naldi et al., 2009) or partitioning large systems into
smaller subsystems to enable better analysis and understanding
for continuous network models as in Conzelmann et al. (2001),
Wang et al. (2004), Indic et al. (2006), Borisov et al. (2005),
Conzelmann et al. (2006), Clarke (1992), Ball et al. (2006),
Radulescu et al. (2008), Hartwell et al. (1999), Saez—Rodriguez
et al. (2005) and Gorban et al. (2006). In this article, we focus
on BNs with perturbation owing to their role in modeling gene
regulatory networks, a key point being that their dynamics can be
modeled using Markov chains; thereby facilitating the development
of control policies that can shift the network SSD toward desirable
states. The main objective of our work is to design suboptimal
stationary control policies and our proposed reduction mappings
provide the means to this end. Although the literature mainly focuses
on reduction of biochemical networks in a continuous simulation
framework (Clarke, 1992; Conzelmann et al., 2001, 2006; Gorban
et al., 2006; Radulescu et al., 2008; Saez—Rodriguez et al., 2005),
while our work models gene regulatory networks in a discrete
mathematical framework, the idea of partitioning large systems into

multiscale or hierarchical small subsystems could be an interesting
future research direction on model reduction for BN—based gene
regulatory networks if one can suitably abstract the relationships
within subnetworks.

As typically formulated, the control problem is characterized
by a target gene whose expression is to be altered by the control
policy and one or more control genes whose expressions are
altered by intervention. For instance, in the well—studied control
model for gene WNT5A in the case of metastatic melanoma, the
upregulation of WNT5A is associated with increased metastatic
competence, so that the goal of the control policy is to downregulate
WNT5A (Shmulevich and Dougherty, 2007). The control gene
in the WNT5A network is pirin. The control policy acts by
observing the state of the network at each time point and,
based on the state, decides whether to alter the value of the
control gene.

From our perspective here, were the network is too large to derive
the optimal control policy, we would like to delete one or more genes
from the network (neither the target nor the control gene) so that we
could derive a policy on the reduced network that would induce
a suboptimal policy on the original network. There are four basic
steps in this procedure: (i) apply an algorithm to the network to
select a gene for deletion; (ii) apply an algorithm to construct the
gene logic for the reduced network; (iii) apply a control algorithm
to the reduced network to derive a control policy on the reduced
network; and (iv) induce a control policy on the original network
based on the control policy derived for the reduced network. Step 1
can be amended by selecting more than one gene for deletion. The
method proposed herein employs the coefﬁcient of determination
(COD; Dougherty et al., 2000) to choose genes for deletion, adapts
the collapsing heuristic of Ivanov and Dougherty (2004) to construct
the wiring of the reduced network, designs a control policy on the
reduced network using either the MFPT control policy (Vahedi et al.,
2008) or the SSD control policy (Qian et al., 2009), and ﬁnishes with
a procedure to induce a control policy on the original network. The
MFPT and SSD control policies have been chosen on account of their
computational efﬁciency and generally satisfactory performance;
however, other control policies could be applied on the reduced
network.

Performance of the COD—based reduction procedure is evaluated
by its effects on the SSD and on how well it approximates the
stationary control designed on the full network. The main effect on
the SSD that interests us is the shift of the probability mass toward
the desirable states. This shift is computed as the absolute value of
the difference between the SSDs of the network before and after
applying the control policy. The algorithm is formulated for BNs
(Huang, 1999; Kauffman, 1993, 1969) with perturbation; however,
since a binary context—sensitive PBN (Brun et al., 2005; Shmulevich
et al., 2002) is a collection of BNs with perturbation endowed with a
selection probability structure (and a general PBN is a collection of
more ﬁnely quantized versions of BNs), the algorithm can be applied
to a PBN by applying it to each constituent BN for the same gene,
thereby reducing the PBN. As formulated in this article, the control
problem involves a single control gene and a single target gene, but
there is no restriction relative to either the number of control genes
or target genes insofar as the reduction algorithm is concerned, so
long as the control algorithm applied on the reduced network has no
such restrictions. Neither the MFPT nor the SSD control algorithms
have such restrictions.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

2.1 BNS

A BN with perturbation p, BNp=(V,f), on n genes is deﬁned by a set
of nodes V={x1, ...,xn} and a vector of Boolean functions f: [f1,...,f”].
The variable x,- e{0, 1} represents the expression level of gene i, with 1
representing high and 0 representing low expression (Shmulevich et al.,
2002). f represents the regulatory rules between genes. At every time step,
the value of x,- is predicted by the values of a set, W), of genes at the
previous time step, based on the regulatory function f i . W,={x,-1,...,x,-ki}
is called the predictor set and the function f i is called the predictor ﬁmction
of xi. A state of the BNp is a vector s=(x1,...,xn)e{0,1}”, and the state
space of the BNp is the collection S of all states of the network. The
perturbation parameter p 6(0, 1] models random gene mutations, i.e. at each
time point there is a probability p of any gene changing its value uniformly
randomly. The underlying model of a BNp is a ﬁnite Markov chain and
its dynamics are completely described by its 2” x 2” transition probability
matrix, P=(p(S,-,Sj))l-2;:1, where p(S,-,Sj) is the probability of the chain
undergoing the transition from the state s,- to the state Sj. The perturbation
probability p makes the chain ergodic and therefore it possesses a steady state
probability distribution 71’ deﬁned by JTTP = JTT, where T denotes transpose.

2.2 COD

CoD measures how a set of random variables improves the prediction
of a target variable, relative to the best prediction in the absence of any
conditioning observation (Dougherty et al., 2000). Let X=(X1,X2, ...,Xn)
be a vector of predictor binary random variables, Y a binary target variable
and f a Boolean function such that f (X) predicts Y. The mean square error of
f (X) as a predictor of Y is the expected squared difference, E [[f(X) — Y lz].
Let 80pt(Y, X) be the minimum MSE among all predictor functions f (X) for
Y and 80(Y) be the error of the best estimate of Y without any predictors.
The CoD is deﬁned as

80(Y) —80pt(YaX)
80(Y)

Letting x1,x2,...,x2n denote the 2” possible values for X, running from
(0,0, ...,0) to (1, 1, ..., 1), the relevant quantities are given by

CoDX(Y)= (1)

2n
80pt(Y,X)=ZP(X=Xj)min[P(Y=0|xj),P(Y= llxj)] (2)
j=1
and
80(Y)=min[P(Y=0),P(Y=1)] (3)

(Dougherty et al., 2000). For more information and a numerical example,
refer to Supplementary Material. The CoD determines the strength of the
connection between a target gene and its predictors and has been used since
the early days of DNA microarray analysis to characterize the nonlinear
multivariate interaction between genes (Kim et al., 2000) and has more
recently been used to characterize canalizing genes (Martins et al., 2008)
and contextual genomic regulation (Dougherty et al., 2009). We have
restricted ourselves to the Boolean case; thereby arriving at the preceding
representations of 80pt(Y,X) and 80(Y); however, the basic deﬁnition for
CoDX(Y) is not so restricted (Dougherty et al., 2000).

2.3 MFPT control policy

Optimal intervention is usually formulated as an optimal stochastic control
problem (Bertsekas, 2005). We focus on intervention via a single control
gene g, and stationary control policies Mg :5 —> {0,1} based on g. The values
0/1 are interpreted as off/on for the application of the control: 1 meaning that
the current value of g is ﬂipped, and 0 meaning that no control is applied.
The MFPT policy is based on the comparison between the MFPTs of
a state s and its ﬂipped (with respect to g) state 5g (Vahedi et al., 2008).
When considering intervention, the state space S can be partitioned into

desirable D and undesirable U states according to the expression values of
a given target set W of genes. For simplicity, we assume W = {x}, the target
gene x is the leftmost gene in the state’s binary representations, i.e. x1 =x,
s = (x,x2, . . . ,xn), and the desirable states correspond to the value x = 0. With
these assumptions, the transition probability matrix P of the network can be

written as
P P
P: ( DD DU ) (4)
PUD PUU

Using this representation, one can compute the MFPT required for a state s to
reach the boundary between desirable and undesirable states. Computation
of these average times is performed in the time scale used for the state
transitions of the network. If one uses the states of the network to index
the components of the vectors in the 2”—dimensional Euclidean space R2",
then one can form the vectors KU and KD that contain the MFPTs needed
for the states in D and U to reach the undesirable and the desirable states,
respectively. For example, the coordinate KD(s) of KD gives the MFPT for
the undesirable state s to reach the set D of desirable states. The two vectors
KU and KD are of dimension 2”_1, and, according to a well—known result
from the theory of Markov chains (Norris, 1998), are given as solutions to
the following system of linear equations:

KU = e+PDDKU 
K0 2 e—I—PUUKD 

where e denotes the vector of dimension 2”—1 with all of its coordinates
equal to 1. For more details on the deﬁnitions and theorems behind MFPT
equations, refer to the Supplementary Material. To understand the intuition
behind the MFPT algorithm, it is important to notice that, because the control
gene g is different from the target gene, every state s belongs to the same class
of states, D or U, as its ﬂipped state 5g . With this in mind, if a desirable state s
reaches U on average faster than 5g , it is reasonable to apply control and start
the next network transition from its ﬂipped state 5g . Thus, the design of the
stationary MFPT control policy is based on the differences KD(s) —KD(§g)
and K U (5g ) —K U(s). To avoid too frequent application of control, the MFPT
algorithm uses a tuning parameter y> 0, and these differences are compared
with the value of 7/, which is related to the cost of applying control. For
example, 7/ is set to a larger value when the ratio of the cost of control to the
cost of the undesirable states is higher, the intent being to apply the control
less frequently (Vahedi et al., 2008).

2.4 SSD control policy

The SSD policy (Qian et al., 2009) uses the analytic formulation of the
steady state mass of a perturbed Markov chain given in Qian and Dougherty
(2008) to quantify the shifted steady state mass after applying possible
controls. A perturbation (change) in the logic deﬁning a BN results in the
original transition probability matrix P and SSD 71’ being changed to B and
at, respectively. In Qian and Dougherty (2008), the fundamental matrix,
Z, is used to represent ft in terms of 71’. Z: [I—P-I-eJTT]—1, where T
denotes transpose and e is a column vector whose components are all unity
(Schweitzer, 1968). For a rank-one perturbation, the perturbed Markov chain
has the transition matrix I3=P+abT, where a,b are two arbitrary vectors
satisfying We 2 0, and abT represents a rank—one perturbation to the original
Markov chain P. In the special case where the transition mechanisms before
and after perturbation differ only in one state, say state k,
ﬂak) T T 71(k)

~T T
77 77 +1—bTZe(k) 77 +1—p(k)

 

W (7)

where 6T 2 bTZ and e(k) is the elementary vector with a 1 in the k—th position
and 0s elsewhere (Hunter, 2005; Qian and Dougherty, 2008; Schweitzer,
1968).

The results for these special cases can be extended to arbitrary types
of perturbations so that it is possible to compute the SSDs of arbitrarily
perturbed Markov chains in an iterative fashion (Qian and Dougherty, 2008).

COD-based reduction algorithm

 

To deﬁne the SSD control policy, let state E be the ﬂipped state (with
respect to control gene g) corresponding to state s (as with the MFPT control
policy). Let in] be the original steady state mass of the undesirable states and
let ftU(s) and ftUGg) denote the steady state masses of the undesirable states
resulting from altering the original transition probability matrix by forcing s
to 5g and forcing 5g to s, respectively. The SSD policy is deﬁned on pairs of
states, s and 5g , in the following manner: if both ftU(s) and ftUGg ) are larger
than in], then control is applied to neither; otherwise, if ftU(s) 5 ftUGg ), then
control is applied to s, and if ftU(s) > ftUGg), then control is applied to 5g .

2.5 Selection policies

Assuming gene d is to be deleted from the network, a reduction mapping can
be used to deﬁne the transition rules for states in the reduced network (Ivanov
and Dougherty, 2004). The critical issue is how to design the reduction
mapping. For every two states 5d and s that differ only in the value of d,
consider the states to which they transition: s—> w and 5" —> v. Following
deletion, d becomes a latent variable and, under the reduction mapping, the
states s and 5d collapse to a state 5 in the reduced network. The state 5 is
obtained from either s or 5d by removing their d —th coordinate. The design of
a reduction mapping is equivalent to ﬁlling in the entries of the truth table of
the reduced network by selecting one of the two possible transitions 5 —> W
or §—> i), where the states iii and 1V2 are the collapsed states in the reduced
network that correspond to W and v respectively. Thus, one arrives at the
following deﬁnition:

DEFINITION 1. A selection policy vd corresponding to the deleted gene d is
a 2”-dimensional vector, vd e {0, 1}2n, indexed by the states of S and having
components equal to 1 at exactly one of the positions corresponding to each
pair (S,§d), S e S.

For each gene d there are 22%1 different selection policies. Using this
deﬁnition, the reduction mapping Hvd corresponding to the selection policy
vd is constructed by selecting the transition E—nii if vd(s)=1 or s—HV),
otherwise. The goodness of a selection policy (in its own right) depends
on how it preserves structural relationships of the original network in the
reduced network, for instance, steady state behavior and control policies.

3 ALGORITHM

The procedure we propose has three aspects. First, the original
network must be reduced. This entails two steps: gene deletion and
a reduction mapping to construct the regulatory structure for the
remaining genes. Second a control policy must be designed on the
reduced network. We will use either the MFPT or SSD algorithm
to design the control policy. Lastly, a control policy for the original
network must be induced from the control policy designed on the
reduced network. We refer to the overall algorithm as COD-Reduce.

3.1 Deletion

The algorithm selects the gene to delete based on two criteria. If
there are genes isolated from the rest of the genes, then the algorithm
randomly selects one of them as the candidate for deletion. A gene
is called isolated if it does not predict any other genes and no other
gene predicts it. Otherwise, the combination of three genes that
has the smallest steady state CoD in determining the target gene is
found and the gene chosen for deletion is the one with the weakest
inﬂuence in terms of CoD value on the target gene from that triple
of genes. We have based the CoD on triples of genes because, as
Kauffman points out, the average connectivity of the model cannot
be too high if its dynamics is not chaotic (Kauffman, 1993), and
threee—predictor connectivity is commonly assumed in BN and PBN

modeling (Shmulevich and Dougherty, 2007). The procedure we
have adopted ensures that the candidate gene for deletion from the
network has small inﬂuence on the target gene if the model has
reached its SSD. The deletion procedure is described in detail in
Algorithm 1.

Finding an optimal selection policy would require testing each one
of the 22H possible reduced networks, which is computationally
infeasible for large networks. In the present article, a heuristically
chosen selection policy is combined with an inducement procedure
to design a control policy on the original network. The selection
policy we use here is designed by considering the SSD of the
network. The intuition behind this approach relies on two facts:
ﬁrst, attractors are an essential part of the network and therefore
should be preserved during the reduction; second, states with larger
steady state probabilities are more likely to be visited during the
long—run transitions of the network. Based on these considerations,
the selection policy proceeds as follows: for states 5 and Ed
that only differ in the deleted gene d, the state transitions of
the states possessing larger steady state probability mass will be
kept as transitions for the reduced states, excluding the gene for
deletion; however, if either 5 or Ed is an attractor and the other
is not, then the attractor state is chosen to determine the function
structure. Algorithm 2 represents the steps of reduction mapping.
This selection policy has 1 for the states whose functions are kept
as the result of reduction and 0 for the rest. If two states that differ
only in their d coordinate, then only one of them can have a 1 in the
corresponding selection policy.

3.2 Inducement

Suppose the original network has n genes, the reduced network
has m<n genes based on n—m deletion—reduction applications,
and, without loss of generality, suppose the last n—m genes have
been deleted. Then, for any state (x1,x2,...,xm) in the reduced
network, there are 2”"” states in the original network of the form
(x1,...,xm,zl,...,zn_m). If ,ured is the control policy designed on
the reduced network, then the induced policy on the original network

4 DISCUSSION

We have carried out several simulations to study the performance of
the CoD—Reduce algorithm.

4.1 Randomly generated networks

An inherent difﬁculty in a simulation study on the performance
of COD-Reduce is how to choose the target and control genes. In
practice, the target gene is chosen in such a way that its behavior is
closely related to the phenotype of interest and the control gene can
either be selected via biological knowledge or according to some
criterion related to its ability to control the target gene. If it were
not for the computational burden, one might simply choose all non—
target genes as control genes and see which one has the largest
beneﬁcial impact. One approach that has been taken to identify a
good control gene in the case of both ﬁnite— and inﬁnite—horizon
dynamic programming—based control is to choose the gene whose
inﬂuence is the greatest with respect to the target gene (Pal et al.,
2006). Here, we use the fact that the CoD provides a measure of gene
interdependence and use it to choose the control gene. Speciﬁcally,
we can compute for each non—target gene the CoD as a predictor
of the target gene and choose the control gene to be the one with
the largest CoD. It is important to recognize that a strong CoD
for gene g1 predicting gene g2 does not imply that g1 and g2 are
directly connected in the model or, if the model were inferred from
expression data, that they are directly biochemically connected, nor

does it mean that g1 is the best control gene for g2 based on the
MFPT control policy or, for that matter, any other control policy.

In random network simulations, we also have the issue of how to
choose the target gene, since the randomly generated networks are of
a purely computational nature. Since we are interested in networks in
which the target gene is controllable, we need to choose a target gene
for which there exists a non—target gene that can exercise control over
it. A simple way to do that is to consider all gene—to—gene CoDs and
pick the control and target genes to be the two genes possessing
the largest gene—to— gene CoD, the former being the control gene
and the latter being the target gene. While it is true that this choice
provides greater controllability than would normally be expected in
a real biological problem, it affords us the opportunity to get a good
measure of the loss of controllability that results from COD-Reduce,
that is, from deletion, reduction and inducement.

Given this protocol for choosing the control—target pair, to study
the performance of the CoD—Reduce algorithm, we have performed
a simulation study on sets of 100 randomly generated Boolean
networks with perturbation, with 7,8,9 and 10 genes. These have
been generated using the algorithm developed in Pal et al. (2005),
subject to the constraint that for each network half of its attractors are
among the desirable states. For each network of size n E {7, 8, 9, 10},
we have reduced the original network to n — 1,n — 2, .. . ,4 genes and
for each reduction designed either the MFPT or SSD control policy
on the reduced network and induced a policy on the original network
of size n. We have limited networks to 10 genes because we need to
compute the control policy on each originally generated network in
order to make the comparisons. However, in general COD-Reduce is
not restricted to any number of genes and can handle large networks,
as long as the SSD is obtainable. In such large networks COD-Reduce
is used to make reductions by deleting genes until the point that it
is feasible to compute the control policy of the reduced network.
For each generated network of size 7—10 genes, we apply the
MFPT and SSD algorithms directly to it and compute the amount of
steady state mass shifted from undesirable to desirable states. Letting
71D =(JTD1 ,JTD2, . . . ,JTDm) and col) =(wD1 ,tz, . . . ,me) denote the
probability vectors composed of steady state masses of the desirable
states before and after control, respectively, the shift is deﬁned by

m

A=Zka—nnk (9)
k=1

A provides a measure of the effectiveness of the overall algorithm—
deletion, reduction and inducement—the goal being to decrease the
probability of being in undesirable states and increase the probability
of being in desirable states in the long run. We also apply the
induced policies arising from reductions to n—1,n—2,...,4 genes
and compute the mass shifts. Figure 1 shows, for each n, the average
shift of the SSD under the MFPT policy on the original network and
the average shift for the induced policies arising from reductions to
n—1,n—2,...,4 genes. Figure 2 gives analogous results using the
SSD policy. The salient point regarding the 9— and 10— gene networks
is that, after an initial drop off for a few—gene reduction, the shift
tends to stabilize for further reduction and, in all cases, the induced
policy achieves signiﬁcant beneﬁcial results.

Note that the beneﬁcial steady state shift when designing the
control policy on the original network is, on average, slightly better
for the SSD policy in comparison with the MFPT policy, and that
this agrees with the ﬁndings in Qian et al. (2009). On the other

4.2 Gastrointestinal cancer network application

To test COD-Reduce on a larger, real—world network, we have
applied it to a 17—gene network designed from a gastrointestinal
cancer dataset (Price et al., 2007). To infer the BNp, the microarray
data were normalized, ﬁltered and binarized using methods from
Shmulevich and Zhang (2002). Network inference is based on a
network— growing algorithm that requires an initialization with a seed
gene, a variant of the algorithm proposed in Hashimoto et al. (2004).
As the seed, we use OBSCN, one of two genes composing the best
classiﬁer in Price et al. (2007). The network is grown by adding
genes that have strong connectivity to this gene, as measured by
the CoD. The seed gene, OBSCN, is set as the target gene and the
second gene added to the network, GREM2, is set as the control gene.
Unless there is a biologically known relation between a target gene

and a particular phenotype, as in the case of WNT5A and metastatic
competence in melanoma, there is no standard way to select a
target and control gene pair; however, it is reasonable to expect
that the best 1—gene classiﬁer, OBSCN, that discriminates between
two types of cancer can also be a potential target for a possible
therapeutic intervention. GERMZ has the strongest CoD connection
to this gene and thus, could be viewed as a good candidate for a
control gene. At each iterative step, the gene having the strongest
connectivity, measured by the CoD, to one of the genes from the
current network is added to the network. Then, the network is
rewired taking into account that a new gene in the network can
change the way genes inﬂuence each other. The 17—gene network
includes the following genes: OBS CN , GREM 2, HSD11B1, U CHL 1,
A_24_P920699, BNC 1, FM03, LOC441047, THC2123516, NLN,
COL1A1, IBSP, C2001f 166, KUB3, TPM 1, D90075 and BC042026.
The CoD computations are based on the SSD of the current
network. After generating the 17—gene network, COD-Reduce is
applied consecutively to reduce it to a 10—gene network. The ﬁnal
10 genes that are remained in the network are: OBSCN, GREM 2,

desirable and undesirable states.

HSDllBl, BNCl, LOC441047, NLN, C2001f166, KUB3, D90075
and BC042026. At each reduction step, using an algorithm from
Kim et al. (2002), the network SSD, which is required for the
CoD computations, is estimated by ﬁrst running the network for
a long time and using the Kolmogorov—Smimov test to decide if
the network has reached its steady state. After reducing the original
network down to 10 genes, the MFPT control policy for the reduced
network is determined and induced back on the original 17—gene
network. Figure 3 shows the considerable shift in the SSD of the
network, about 0.15 of the probability mass after applying the
induced control policy, toward desirable states.

4.3 Concluding remarks

The overall performance of CoD—Reduce depends on the individual
performance of its components: gene deletion, the reduction
mapping and inducement, and how these components interact with
each other and with the control policy designed on the reduced
network. While the CoD does not measure regulation directly,
one can be fairly conﬁdent that if the CoD for gene d predicting
the target gene is small, then d is unlikely to have much to do

with controlling the target and therefore deletion of d from the
network is unlikely to seriously impact a control policy for the
target. It is impossible to say that our proposed selection policy
is the best one available, but it is based on considerations closely
tied to the long—run behavior of the network, whose control is
our objective. Finally, the inducement procedure introduces some
loss of optimality because, in effect, it identiﬁes several states in
the original network with a single state in the reduced network;
nevertheless, it maintains the integrity of the control on the gene
state vector for which it has been designed and this kind of criterion
has a long history in system decompression in the absence of
any further qualifying knowledge. Of course, the performance of
COD-Reduce depends on how these three components work in
consort. The simulations for 10—gene and smaller networks indicate
that COD-Reduce provides signiﬁcant beneﬁcial steady state shift
relative to the shift for the control policy designed on the original
network. Perhaps more importantly, even though we cannot compare
the shifts on the 17—gene gastrointestinal network produced by
COD-Reduce and the control policy designed on the original network
(since we cannot obtain the latter), COD-Reduce yields a substantial
shift in the steady state mass, which is our pragmatic goal.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein interaction networks provide an important
system-level view of biological processes. One of the fundamental
problems in biological network analysis is the global alignment of a
pair of networks, which puts the proteins of one network into corres-
pondence with the proteins of another network in a manner that con-
serves their interactions while respecting other evidence of their
homology. By providing a mapping between the networks of different
species, alignments can be used to inform hypotheses about the func-
tions of unannotated proteins, the existence of unobserved inter-
actions, the evolutionary divergence between the two species and
the evolution of complexes and pathways.

Results: We introduce GHOST, a global pairwise network aligner that
uses a novel spectral signature to measure topological similarity be-
tween subnetworks. It combines a seed-and-extend global alignment
phase with a local search procedure and exceeds state-of—the-art
performance on several network alignment tasks. We show that the
spectral signature used by GHOST is highly discriminative, whereas
the alignments it produces are also robust to experimental noise.
When compared with other recent approaches, we find that GHOST
is able to recover larger and more biologically significant, shared sub-
networks between species.

1 INTRODUCTION

We present a novel method for the global pairwise alignment of
biological networks. Such alignments are crucial in analyzing the
increasing amount of experimental data being generated by
high-throughput techniques, such as yeast two-hybrid screening
(Fields and Song, 1989), tandem afﬁnity puriﬁcation mass spec-
trometry (Gavin et al., 2006) and chip-seq (Johnson et al., 2007)
that reveal biological interactions within the cell.

A solution to the global network alignment problem is an
injective mapping f from the nodes of one network
G = (Vg,EG) into another network H: (VH,EH) such that
the structure of G is well preserved. This global mapping
allows us to measure the similarity between proteins in G and
those in H in terms of shared interaction patterns. By exposing
large subnetworks with shared interactions patterns across

species, a network alignment allows us to transfer protein func-
tion annotations from one organism to another using more in-
formation than can be captured by sequence alone. For example,
it has been shown that, across species, the protein with the most
similar sequence does not always play the same functional role
(Sharan et al., 2005), and that topological information can be
used to disambiguate sequence-similar proteins and determine
functional orthology (Bandyopadhyay et al., 2006). Additionally,
by looking at the magnitude of structure conserved between G
and H, we can measure the similarity between these networks
and infer phylogenetic relationships between the corresponding
species (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011). We can also hypothesize the
existence of unobserved interactions (missing edges), remove
noise from error-prone high-throughput experiments and track
the evolution of pathways.

Our approach to the global network alignment problem uses a
novel measure of topological node similarity that is based on
multiscale spectral signatures. These signatures are composed
from the spectra of the normalized Laplacian for subgraphs of
varying sizes centered around a node. We combine this highly
speciﬁc yet robust node signature with a seed-and-extend align-
ment strategy that explicitly enforces the proximity of aligned
neighborhoods. The initial alignment is improved by means of
a local search procedure. We implement these ideas in our
network alignment software, GHOST, which exceeds state-of-
the-art accuracy under several different metrics of alignment
quality.

There has been signiﬁcant interest in the network alignment
problem, and previous work can naturally be divided into three
main categories: approaches to local network alignment,
approaches to network querying and approaches to global net-
work alignment. Because we are introducing a system for global
network alignment, we restrict our discussion to the relevant
work in this area.

Singh et a]. (2008) introduced IsoRank, which uses a recur-
sively deﬁned measure of topological similarity between nodes in
different networks. They proposed an eigenvector-based formu-
lation to discover a high-scoring matching. Liao et a]. (2009)
developed IsoRankN, which extends IsoRank with a new algo-
rithm for multiple network alignment based on spectral cluster-
ing. Chindelevitch et a]. (2010) use a local search heuristic, which
they call PISWAP, to iteratively improve an initial alignment
that is based solely on sequence data. The Graemlin aligner
was originally developed by Flannick et a]. (2006) to discover
evolutionarily conserved modules across multiple biological net-
works. Later, it was extended (Flannick et al., 2009) to perform
global multiple network alignment. However, this approach

relies on a variety of additional information about the networks
being aligned, including phylogenetic information. Further,
sample alignments are required for the parameter learning
phase of Graemlin2.

Recently, multiple attempts have been made to tackle the bio-
logical network alignment problem using graph matching. Klau
(2009) introduced a non-linear integer program to maximize a
structural matching score between two given networks and then
showed how the problem can be linearized, yielding an integer
linear program, and ﬁnally suggested a Lagrangian relaxation
approach to the integer linear program. Later, El-Kebir et a].
(2011) extended this approach and improved the upper and
lower bounds of the relaxation, implementing their approach
in the Natalie 2.0 software package. The HopeMap approach
of Tian and Samatova (2009) used an algorithm that iteratively
merges conserved connected components. Zaslavskiy et a]. (2009)
explore the use of a number of graph-matching methods, par-
ticularly the PATH and graduated assignment methods, which
attempt to ﬁnd a permutation matrix between vertices of the
networks being aligned that maximizes a score that is a combin-
ation of the structural similarity and conserved interactions of
the matched vertices. This optimization is NP hard, and they
must rely on a relaxation to discover an approximate solution.
Many similar graph-matching approaches have been applied to
shape matching in computer graphics and computer vision
(Duchenne et al., 2011; Torresani et al., 2008; Noma and
Cesar, 2010). All of these matching-based approaches require a
large number of constraints to be placed on the set of potential
alignments, usually in the form of homology information be-
tween the proteins of the networks being aligned, to run in a
reasonable amount of time. These constraints vastly reduce the
search space and help bring these computationally burdensome
methods into the reahn of tractability. However, the hard con-
straints introduced by the homology information can have a
negative effect on the ability of these methods to discover truly
novel functional homologs between highly divergent species. In a
way, these methods focus more on discovering conserved pat-
terns of interactions between proteins that are already posited to
be homologous, rather than on performing a truly de novo and
unconstrained alignment of biological networks that is merely
guided by homology information. GHOST takes a hybrid
approach, where the initial alignment can be constrained by
some aspect of the scoring function, but the local search proced-
ure allows exploration into regions of the alignment space that
do not adhere to the original constraints.

The GRAAL family of programs, like IsoRank, performs un-
constrained and global pairwise alignments of biological net-
works. Kuchaiev et a]. (2010) originally introduced GRAAL,
which measures the topological similarity of nodes in different
networks based on the distance between their graphlet degree
signatures and aligns the networks using a seed-and-extend strat-
egy. Milenkovic et a]. (2010) then introduced H-GRAAL, which
relies on the same graphlet degree signatures used by GRAAL
but performs the alignment of the networks by solving the linear
assignment problem via the Hungarian algorithm (Kuhn, 1955).
Finally, Kuchaiev and Przulj (2011) introduced MI-GRAAL,
which combines these two alignment strategies. It relies on a
seed-and-extend alignment procedure but uses the Hungarian
algorithm only to compute the assignment between local

neighborhoods of the two graphs that maximizes the sum of
their linear scoring function. MI—GRAAL also incorporates a
number of other topological metrics, in addition to the graphlet
degree signatures, to help quantify the topological similarity be-
tween nodes.

Our network aligner, GHOST, combines a novel spectral sig-
nature to measure topological similarity with a seed-and-extend
alignment procedure, and an iterative local search step. In
Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we show that GHOST performs much
better than current aligners at the network self-alignment task.
In Section 3.3, we compare an ensemble of alignments produced
by different aligners, as we vary their parameter settings to trade
off between the topological and biological quality of the align-
ments they produce. GHOST consistently outperforms the other
aligners in these tests and is able to produce alignments higher
overall quality. This improved quality will be useful for more
accurate comparative systems biology.

2 METHODS
2.1 Measuring alignment quality

It is challenging to state the global network alignment problem formally
and precisely because a ‘good’ alignment balances two, often disparate,
goals. A high-quality global alignment between two biological networks
should reveal shared topological structure between the networks being
aligned while also respecting the strong evidence for homology revealed
via sequence analysis.

Neither of these goals, however, should act as hard constraints when
aligning two networks, and a high-quality global network alignment
should strive to satisfy both the topological and sequence requirements.
This naturally leads to two distinct measures for the quality of network
alignments; one quantiﬁes topological quality, the degree of shared struc-
ture revealed between the two networks, and the other quantiﬁes biolo-
gical quality, how well the alignment respects the biological and
functional similarities of the proteins.

2.2 Topological quality

A topological quality metric should measure the degree to which the
structure of G is preserved, under f (the computed injective mapping
from VG to VH), when mapped into H. For example, we expect that
an alignment of high topological quality will map interacting proteins in
G to interacting proteins in H. The most common measure of topological
quality is edge correctness (EC), which measures the percentage of edges
from G that are aligned to edges in H. Let G[V] be the induced subgraph

of G on the vertex set V, f(V) = {f(v)|v e V}, f(E) = {(f(u),f(v))|
(u, v) e E} and f(G) = (f( VG),f(EG)). Then, the EC is deﬁned as

LKEG) 0 EH‘.

EC(G, 11,13 = IEGI

(1)

Despite its prevalence, EC fails to differentiate alignments that one
might intuitively consider to be of different topological quality (see
Fig. 1) because it accounts only for the number of edges from G that
are mapped into H and incorporates no notion of the similarity between
G and the induced subgraph of f(G).

We introduce a new measure of topological quality, the induced con-
served structure (ICS) score, that uses a more discriminative notion of
conserved structure than EC. We deﬁne the ICS score between G and H
induced by the alignment f as

LKEG) 0 EH‘.

ICS G,H, =
( ﬂ IEHlf(Vo)]|

Fig. 1. The mapping from G to H given by the solid green arrows can be
considered a better alignment than that given by the dashed red arrows,
despite the fact that they both have the same EC

Notice that, for the example given in Figure 1, although the edge EC
score of both the green and red mappings is 1, the ICS successfully
distinguishes the two cases. In particular, the ICS of the green mapping
remains 1, whereas the ICS of the red mapping becomes 0.4, agreeing
with the intuition that the green mapping conserves more structure than
does the red mapping. Also, the ICS score is 1 if and only if G is iso-
morphic to H[f(VG)]. Thus, alignments that map subgraphs of G into
denser subgraphs of H, where there are potentially many more mappings,
will be punished under the ICS score while they will not be punished
under the standard EC score. Optimizing EC and ICS directly is, in
general, N73 hard. This can be shown by reduction from CLIQUE, as
when G is a clique, both EC and ICS are 1 if and only if H contains a
clique of order IVGI.

2.2.] Biological Quality Given an alignment, f: G —> H, a measure
of biological quality should evaluate the similarity of p and f(p) in terms
of biological function. The most common measure of similarity computes
the enrichment of shared gene ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000)
annotations between the mapped proteins. The greater the enrichment,
the higher the biological quality of the alignment. In most previous work
(Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Singh et al., 2008), two GO annotations are
considered the same only if they are identical.

This common metric has two main disadvantages. First, many GO
terms are assigned largely based on sequence homology to proteins
with veriﬁed annotations, which strongly biases the results in favor of
alignments that ignore topology completely and align proteins based
solely on sequence similarity. Additionally, measuring the functional en-
richment between proteins by considering only exact overlap between
their associated GO annotations ignores the hierarchical structure of an-
notation similarity encoded in the ontology. Only recently has the litera-
ture on network alignment (El-Kebir et al., 2011) started to use methods
(J aeger et al., 2010) that use the hierarchical structure of GO. Most pre-
vious work (Kuchaiev et al., 2010; Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Liao et al.,
2009; Singh et al., 2008) considers only the exact overlap metric, and it is
potentially misleading.

Although the issue that annotations often come from sequence remains
a concern, we address the second concern by using an additional metric of
protein function similarity that takes into account the relationships be-
tween annotations encoded by the GO hierarchy. Pesquita et al. (2009)
recently compared a number of methods for computing protein simila-
rities based on GO annotations. They ﬁnd that one of the best performing
methods computes the similarity of GO terms using the Resnik onto-
logical similarity measure and combines annotation similarities using
the best-match average strategy to obtain a functional similarity measure
on proteins. We adopted an implementation of this measure provided in
the csbl.go R-project package (Ovaska et al., 2008). We denote this

similarity measure by 55,071,192), where a is an aspect—biological process
(BP), molecular function (MF) and cellular component —of G0. The
similarity measure between networks G and H induced by the alignment f
under the GO aspect a is given by Sa(G, H, j) = ﬂ 2V sa(p,f(p)).

2.3 Formal problem statement

Formally, we desire an alignment that maximizes a convex combination
of the ICS and biological similarity of the input networks. That is, we
wish to ﬁnd the alignment

argmax nICS(G, H, j) + (1 — 27) Z s,(G, Ho),
feF ae{A}

where F is the set of all complete injective mappings from G to H
and A = {CC,MF,BP} is the set of all GO aspects. We choose the ICS
as opposed to the EC because it more closely matches the intuition for
what constitutes a topologically good alignment. However, as maximizing
the ICS directly is NP hard, and we are often missing reliable GO anno-
tations for various proteins, we have developed the method presented
later in the text that relies on the spectral signatures (see Section 2.3)
and sequence similarity of proteins to determine good seeds for
aligning network regions. The alignment is expanded around these
seeds by approximating the solution to the quadratic assignment
problem (QAP), another NP hard problem. Finally, a local search step
attempts to improve the initial alignment by increasing its topological
quality. Our results suggest that this heuristic produces results of high
quality with regard to the maximizing the objective function described
earlier.

2.4 Spectral signature

One of the primary contributions of our work is the introduction of a
novel topological signature for nodes in a network. We use these signa-
tures to guide our network alignment and to provide a measure of the
similarity, or topological context, of nodes within their respective
networks. Useful topological signatures should be precise, robust to
topological variation and fast to compute. Spectral graph theory pro-
vides tools that allow us to develop a signature having all of these
properties.

There is a well-studied and strong relationship between the structure of
a graph and the spectrum of its adjacency matrix and other related matri-
ces. For example, isomorphic graphs are necessarily cospectral, though
cospectral graphs are not necessarily isomorphic. However, simple com-
parison of spectra provide a powerful isomorphism ﬁlter in practice. In
fact, using the eigenvalues and associated eigenvectors of graphs, Babai
et al. (1982) developed an algorithm for graph isomorphism that is poly-
nomial in the algebraic multiplicity of the graph.

The spectra of graphs are also robust to topological variations. Wilson
and Zhu (2008) show that the distance between the spectra of the normal-
ized Laplacian of graphs correlates well, at least for small perturbations,
with the true edit distance between the graphs. Further, such spectra are
efﬁcient to compute. It takes 0(n3) time to compute the spectrum for
dense graphs with n vertices. However, for sparse graphs, like the biolo-
gical graphs in which we are interested, faster algorithms exist (Pan and
Chen, 1999). For any subgraph, the computation of the spectrum is an
independent operation and can be parallelized.

Our vertex signature is based on the spectrum of the normalized
Laplacian for subgraphs of various radii centered around a vertex.
Consider a graph G = (Vg,EG) and vertex v. We denote by G’V‘, the
induced subgraph on all nodes whose unweighted shortest path length
from v is 5k. We denote by W’V‘, the adjacency matrix of G’V‘. In all
experiments performed in this article, we use the unweighted adjacency
matrix, though using a weighted adjacency matrix is also possible.
Finally, let the matrix D]; be given by

Then, the normalized Laplacian of G]; is L]: = (D’v‘)%(1 — W’V‘)(D’V‘)%,
where I is the appropriately sized identity matrix. The eigendecomposi-
tion of this normalized Laplacian yields U; V = A V, where the sizes of V
and A are the same as that of £1: , but A is a diagonal matrix. We denote
spectrum of U; by 0(UV‘), which is simply the entries along the main
diagonal of A.

Many properties of 0(UV‘) make it an enticing candidate for a
vertex signature. As the U; is a positive, symmetric, semi-deﬁnite
matrix with real entries, emf) consists entirely of non-negative real
numbers. Further, the entries of emf) are bounded below by 0 and
above by 2. Finally, many topological properties of a graph, such as
the number of spanning trees, the Cheeger constant, the distribution of
path lengths (Chung, 1997) and the frequency of motifs (Preciado and
J adbabaie, 2010) are known to be related to the spectrum of its Laplacian.

However, for different vertices, the size of their k-hop neighborhoods
will vary, and thus the length of their spectra will be different, and so the
spectra cannot be directly compared. To overcome this difﬁculty, we
consider the densities of the spectra rather than the spectra themselves.
The spectral density simply measures how eigenvalues are distributed
over their potential range ([0, 2] in the case of the normalized
Laplacian). The intuition behind comparing the spectral densities is
that these distributions retain much (but not all) of the information con-
tained in the spectra themselves. Thus, we compare spectral density func-
tions as a proxy for comparing the spectra themselves. This yields a
commensurate signature that is independent of the order of the graph,
but is nonetheless effective in measuring the structural similarity of
graphs (Banerjee, 2012). For each G’V‘, which we will use this spectral
density, denoted by 81;, as a signature.

To compare the topological context of vertices at different scales, we
simply consider the induced subgraphs for a range of different radii cen-
tered about v (i.e. Gi, GE, ..., G?) This leads, in turn, to a set of different
spectra and, subsequently, different signatures. However, as the radii
have the same meaning across different vertices and graphs (it is just
the diameter of the neighborhood), the corresponding signatures can be
compared directly and independently of the signatures at other radii. This
leads to a simple scheme for comparing the topological contexts of two
vertices at multiple scales using our signature. Given two graphs,
G: (Vg,Eg) and H = (VH,EH), with u e VG and v e VH, and a sequence
of radii R = [1, 2, ..., k] (for all experiments performed in this article, we
set k = 4), we compute the distance between the signatures of u and v for
this sequence of radii as

0....(85, £5) = 2 do; 81). (4)

reR

where d(-, -) can be any desired distance between the two signatures. We
use d = dstruct, the structural distance as deﬁned by Banerjee (2012). The
structural distance is a symmetric information theoretic distance deﬁned
on the smoothed spectral densities of two graphs. Speciﬁcally, the
structural distance between signatures, 8; and 8:, for a particular 1', is
given by:

dstruct(8:p  =  772) *  772) *  

where N(0, 772) is the normal distribution with mean 0 and standard de-
viation 77 [we used a value of 77 = 0.01 as suggested in (Banerjee, 2012)],
‘k is the convolution operator and JS is the Jensen—Shannon divergence.
In the case that the maximum radius of the subgraph centered around a
node u is some k’ <k, then we deﬁne 8; = 81;],Vk’ <r<k.

In a manner similar to IsoRank (Singh et al., 2008), we can incorpor-
ate sequence information into our distance measure between two
proteins u and v by using a simple combination of the topological

distance—D,0100 (85, 85) as deﬁned in Equation (4)—and a sequence dis-
tance, Dseq(u, v), such as the symmetrized BLAST E-value. The total
distance measure is a linear combination of the topological and sequence
distance, parameterized by some weight at and is given by

Do,(u, v) = aompowf, 55) + (1.0 — a)D,,q(u, v). (6)

If no user-suggested at is provided, GHOST automatically computes oz by
scaling the sequence and topological distances so that the lVgll smallest
sequence and topological distances match.

2.5 Alignment procedure

GHOST aligns networks using a two-phase approach. Much like the
strategy used in the sequence alignment tool BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990), GHOST’s initial phase uses a seed-and-extend strategy that
seeds regions of an alignment with high scoring pairs of nodes from the
different networks and then extends the alignments around the neighbor-
hoods of these two nodes. The neighborhoods are matched by computing
an approximate solution to the QAP. This procedure executes in rounds
until all nodes from the smaller of the two networks have been aligned
with some node from the larger network. GHOST’s second phase uses a
local search strategy to explore regions of the solution space around the
initial alignment for a potentially better solution.

The algorithm is given formally in Algorithms l and 2. First, an align-
ment is seeded with a high-scoring match M0 = (M0 , m). This is a pair
of vertices between which the speciﬁed DO, [equation (6)] is minimal.
Then, we consider all pairwise matches between the 1-hop neighborhoods

of these two vertices, M = [(i,j)|i E N(ll71\g)),j e NOTED], and form a
quadratic assignment matrix Q given by:

_ 1 — Da(M[a][0]»Mla][1]) if a = 1’

proximate the solution to the QAP by ﬁnding the leading eigenvector
of Q and binarizing this vector to select matches that adhere to the
matching constraints [further details on this QAP approximation algo-
rithm can be found in Leordeanu and Hebert (2005)]. The solution to the
QAP assigns each protein from the smaller of the two neighborhoods to
exactly one protein in the larger neighborhood. This mapping is used to
align the currently unmapped proteins in these neighborhoods, and the
matches are inserted into a priority queue as potential seeds by which to
further extend the alignment between these local neighborhoods.
However, we only accept mappings that align proteins with a sequence
distance less than a certain (user deﬁned) value ,8. This is because a
seed-and-extend approach is implicitly biased in favor of extending topo-
logical alignments, and may otherwise match proteins with very little
evidence of sequence homology, simply because they reside in the neigh-
borhoods of already aligned proteins. Biologically, it is more plausible
that a pair of proteins with very low sequence similarity happens to be
adjacent to a pair of currently aligned proteins by chance, or as the result
of spurious edges in the measured networks, than it is that they are truly
functional homologs.

We continue extending the alignment in this manner, covering larger
topological neighborhoods of the original seed nodes, until no further
extension of the alignment between the current neighborhoods is possible.
Then, the next seed pair, M1, is chosen from among the unaligned nodes,
and the same procedure is applied to extend the alignment around this

Once we have computed an initial alignment using the seed-and—extend
procedure, we attempt to improve this alignment using a local search. The
moves of the local search procedure are similar to those used by PISWAP
(Chindelevitch et al., 2010), but the evaluation strategy and application of
rules is different. Given an alignment, f, we seek f similar to f that is
superior. Consider a pair of aligned proteins, a e G and f(u) = w e H,
and a third vertex v 75 w e H. It is possible that we may improve the
quality of our alignment by realigning u so that f’ (u) = v if the topological
and or biological quality is improved by performing this realignment.
When realigning u, there are two cases to consider. Either v is unaligned,
in which case we assign f(u) = v, or v s aligned by f, in which
case aligning u to v requires realigning u’ = f‘1(v). In this case, we con-
sider swapping the aligned protein pairs so that f(u) = v and f(u’) = w.
In either case, we will call this realignment a move from (u, w), denoted by
m = (u, w) —> (a, v). Each move can be given a score, S(m) 2 (s34, s’fl, s?)
where

s34 = EC(G,H,f’) — EC(G,H,f)

Sm _ D86q(u,9 V) _ Dseq(u/9 W) iff_1(V) = Li,
2 _ 0 if v ¢ im(f).

For each mapping, (a, w), in the current alignment, the local search pro-
cedure scores the potential moves from (u, w), and performs the highest
scoring feasible move. The scores are ordered ﬁrst by s34, then s’I" and
ﬁnally s34. Any remaining ties are broken arbitrarily. We call a move
feasible if s34 > 0, s’I" Z 0 and either s34 2 0 or we have decided to allow
a non-Pareto-optimal move from (u, w). The purpose of allowing a
non-Pareto-optimal move from (u, v) is that it may allow us to escape
a local minimum of the alignment space.

There are three parameters that characterize the space of alignments
explored by GHOST. First, 0: determines the relative weight of the se-
quence and topological distances when performing the seed-and-extend
procedure [Equation (6)]. Second, ,8 acts as a hard constraint on sequence
similarity of aligned pairs: no pair, (a, v) of proteins will be aligned if
Dseq(u, v) > ,8. This ensures that, when extending the alignments between
local neighborhoods, no pair of proteins with sequences too divergent is
aligned simply because the alignment can be extended by aligning them.

During the local search procedure, we allow some number of excep-
tions to the hard constraint given by ,8. We deﬁne a parameter b e [R that
is a budget to be used for accepting non-Pareto-optimal moves during the
local search phase of GHOST. The higher this budget, the more likely
GHOST will be to accept local moves that increase the topological qual-
ity of the alignment at the expense of realigning a pair of proteins with
lower sequence similarity than the original pair. We distribute this budget
across local search iterations so that we initially allow many such moves,
but allow far fewer in later iterations. In parLticular, during iteration i, we

have a budget of b, = by, where Z = Z exp(—i) is a partition func-

tion that normalizes the per-iteration weightsl. Within iteration i, we con-
sider each mapped pair of the current alignment in turn and draw a
number p ~ U[0, 1]. If p 5 17,, then we will allow a non-Pareto-optimal
move when realigning this mapped pair; otherwise, such moves will not
be considered. The practical effect of choosing a larger 17 is to reduce the
importance of sequence similarity in the alignment.

2.6 Network data

We performed an alignment of the high-conﬁdence protein interaction
networks of Campylobacter jejuni and Escherichia coli. Both of these
bacterial species are well-studied model organisms. To draw the most
appropriate comparisons to MI-GRAAL, we use the same versions of
the interaction networks that were used by Kuchaiev and Przulj (2011).
Thus, we used E. coli network composed of interactions from the data of
Peregrin-Alvarez et al. (2009), consisting of 1941 proteins among which
there are 3989 interactions. We consider the C. jejuni network that con-
sists of the high-conﬁdence interaction from the data of Parrish et al.
(2007), containing 2988 interactions among 1111 proteins.

We also explored the ability of GHOST to align the protein interaction
networks of distant eukaryotes by performing an alignment of the protein
interaction networks of Arabidopsis thaliana and Drosophila melanoga-
ster. We obtained the interactions for these networks from the HitPredict
website (Patil et al., 2011). HitPredict places interaction data for each
species into three categories: high-conﬁdence small-scale interactions,
high-conﬁdence high-throughput interactions (HCHT) and low-
conﬁdence high-throughput interactions. The high-conﬁdence small-scale
interactions are identiﬁed directly in small-scale experiments considering
<interactions each. The HCHT interactions are those interactions identi-
ﬁed in high-throughput experiments with a likelihood ratio >1, or pre-
dicted from protein complex data. The low-conﬁdence high-throughput
interactions are those having a likelihood ratio <1. In our experiments,
we considered only the high-conﬁdence interactions—the union of those
interactions in the high-conﬁdence small-scale interactions and HCHT
sets. This resulted in a network for A. thaliana having 2082 proteins and
4145 interactions. The D. melanogaster network consisted of 7615 inter-
actions among 3792 different proteins.

2.7 Comparison with other aligners

To investigate the quality of the solutions produced by the different
aligners we consider, we explore how they trade off between topological
and biological quality at different points in their parameter spaces. The
alignments are compared using the novel measures of the topological and
biological quality introduced in Section 2.1. To calculate GO similarities,
we rely on the set of GO annotations for each protein retrieved from the

European Bioinformatics Institute website in June 2011, and the GO
retrieved on November 10, 2011. When producing alignments using
MI-GRAAL, we included graphlet degree signatures, clustering coefﬁ-
cients and sequence similarity scores—the topological features that
Kuchaiev and Przulj (2011) found to lead to the highest scoring and
most stable alignments. MI-GRAAL determines the value of a—the par-
ameter that trades off between functional and sequence similarity—in-
ternally, and so no at value was provided. For IsoRank and Natalie 2.0,
we varied at between 0 and 1 in increments of 0.1. The rest of Natalie 2.0’s
parameters were left at their default values. For GHOST, at was deter-
mined automatically using the procedure speciﬁed in Section 2.3, 10 iter-
ations of the local improvement procedure were performed, ,8 was set to
10 and the budget, b, for non-Pareto-optimal moves was varied over
{0} U {2i}7:_2.

3 RESULTS

We evaluated the performance of GHOST in several different
scenarios and compared against IsoRank, GRAAL,
MI—GRAAL, H-GRAAL and Natalie 2.0. First, we perform
two tests that have been used in the past to assess topological
alignment quality. These tests, self-alignment and self-alignment
with noise, are instructive because the correct node mapping is
known when aligning a network to itself. This allows us to meas-
ure accuracy in a way that is not possible when comparing net-
works from different species. The results of these experiments
provide important evidence about the robustness and speciﬁcity
of different topological signatures and the ability of different
global alignment approaches to align two networks based
solely on topological information. In Sections 3.1 and 3.2, we
are interested primarily in the utility of the local topological sig-
natures and the basic alignment procedures. Thus, we do not
perform the local search phase of GHOST described earlier.
Further, because we cannot use biological sequence information
to constrain the space of alignments, we do not consider the
performance of the graph matching approach (i.e. Natalie 2.0)
on this task.

Subsequently, we consider the alignment between
high-conﬁdence protein—protein interaction networks of a pair
of bacteria and a pair of eukaryotes. Here, we use the new met-
rics described in Section 2.1 to measure the topological and bio-
logical quality of our alignments. Considering unconstrained
alignments using graph-matching approaches either exhausted
the memory of our machines (El-Kebir et al., 2011) or failed to
ﬁnish aligning the networks within 16 h (Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).
Thus, when comparing against graph-matching approaches, we
use Natalie 2.0 (El-Kebir et al., 2011) to produce a constrained
alignment.

3.1 Self-alignment

For networks with many similar sub-regions, even a self-
alignment in the absence of noise can be difﬁcult. To demon-
strate this difﬁculty, we consider a self-alignment of the largest
connected component of a high-conﬁdence network of the bac-
terium Mesorhizobium loti. This network was obtained from the
interactions reported in the study by Shimoda et al. (2008) and
consists of 3006 interactions among 1655 proteins. The align-
ment produced by GHOST is an automorphism of the graph,
with an EC of 100% and a node correctness (the fraction of

nodes that were aligned with themselves) of 79%. The alignment
produced by IsoRank had an EC of 76% and a node correctness
of 53%, whereas the alignment produced by MI—GRAAL had an
EC of 38% and node correctness of only 0.3%. Because
MI-GRAAL is probabilistic in nature, we performed this align-
ment multiple times, using a wide variety and combination of the
topological features suggested in Kuchaiev and Przulj (2011), to
ensure that this failure of self-alignment was not coincidental.
None of these subsequent MI—GRAAL alignments differed in
topological quality—either node or EC—by more than a fraction
of a percent. IsoRank produced an alignment of signiﬁcantly
higher topological quality than the one discovered by
MI-GRAAL; this is different from what we see in the rest of
the tests described later in the text.

Despite the fact that its node correctness is only 79%,
GHOST’s alignment is structurally perfect. Without more infor-
mation beyond what is provided by the network itself, one
cannot hope to obtain a better alignment than the one produced
by GHOST.

3.2 Self-alignment under noise

We also re—performed the experiment originally carried out by
Milenkovic et al. (2010), where progressively noisier variants of
the Saccharomyces cerevisiae interaction network are aligned to
the high-conﬁdence network of Collins et al. (2007). The higher
noise networks are created by starting with the highest conﬁ-
dence network, and then adding interactions (constrained to
the original, high-conﬁdence protein set) in decreasing order of
experimental conﬁdence. As this is again a self-alignment, and
sequence information would allow the almost perfect identiﬁca-
tion of the correspondences between nodes, we consider a purely
topological alignment (i.e. a = 1.0 and ,8 z 00). We explore how
the fraction of correctly aligned nodes changes as larger quanti-
ties of noisy interactions are added to the high-conﬁdence net-
work (Fig. 2).

In the case with the fewest noisy interactions, most of the
programs achieve similar performance. However, as the
number of noisy interactions increases, GHOST outperforms
all of the other approaches by an increasing margin. By the
time 20% of the noisy interactions have been included in the
network, the node correctness of GHOST is more than twice
that of the next-best—performing aligner, and the EC is >30%
higher. There also seems to be a substantial gap between
IsoRank and the rest of the alignment procedures in terms of
both the node and EC. This is indicative of a trend we observe
when aligning real biological networks as well (see later in the
text), where the topological quality of the alignments produced by
IsoRank, even with a large weight being placed on the topological
score, seems to fall behind those produced by the other aligners.

The performance of GHOST in this set of experiments sug-
gests that the spectral signature is robust to the presence of noise
in the network, signiﬁcantly more so than the graphlet degree
signatures used in the GRAAL aligners. These results agree with
existing evidence, such as that presented by Wilson and Zhu
(2008), that the spectral distance between graphs is robust to
small topological changes. Both this robustness and the speciﬁ-
city of the spectra seem to carry over to our topological

3.3 Alignments between different species

The same general performance trend holds under the C. jejuni/E.
coli and A. thaliana/D. melanogaster alignments we considered,
as well as under both the BP and MF aspects of the GO (see
Fig. 3)—owing to sparseness of annotation, the cellular compo-
nent aspect was not included in this analysis. GHOST produces
alignments with very high biological and topological qualities,
and seems capable of trading off between these two goals more
effectively than the other aligners. When placing the most weight
on the biological quality of the alignment (i.e. b = 0 for GHOST
and a = 0 for Natalie 2.0), GHOST and Natalie 2.0 produce
alignments with substantially higher biological quality than the
other aligners. However, GHOST’s alignments exhibit a much
higher ICS score than Natalie 2.0’s. As we vary the correspond-
ing parameters and place more weight on topology, GHOST
produces alignments with topological quality very close to
those obtained by MI—GRAAL, but with signiﬁcantly higher
biological quality. In general, at a similar biological quality
under both GO aspects, GHOST is capable of producing align-
ments with much greater topological quality other aligners.

For IsoRank, the precise value of a seems to matter very little.
It produced alignments of reasonable biological quality but very

low topological quality. In fact, the highest ICS score achieved
by IsoRank was ~ 0.1, when aligning C. jejuni and E. coli.
MI-GRAAL performed very differently from IsoRank, produ-
cing alignments of excellent topological quality but generally
poor biological quality. Speciﬁcally, for both pairs of organisms,
the alignments produced by MI—GRAAL exhibited 3—4 times less
semantic similarity than those produced by Natalie 2.0 and
GHOST.

The alignments obtained by Natalie 2.0 dominate those of
IsoRank in terms of topological and biological quality for a
large range of a. At an approximately equal biological similarity,
Natalie 2.0 is capable of obtaining solutions with ICS scores
between 50% and 120% higher. When aligning the A. thaliana
and D. melanogaster networks, Natalie 2.0 can produce align-
ments with topological quality 120% greater than that of
IsoRank that simultaneously exhibit ~ 10% greater biological
similarity under the GO BP aspect and ~ 20% greater biological
similarity under the GO MF aspect. However, at the same bio-
logical quality, GHOST dominates Natalie 2.0, with topological
quality improvements ranging from a few percentage to a factor
of >2.

3.4 Case study: Functional orthology prediction

To assess the ﬁne-scale biological relevance of the alignments
produced by GHOST, we have aligned the networks of the
well-annotated eukaryotes D. melanogaster and Caenorhabditis
elegans. From this alignment, we verify a few known functional
orthologs and posit a few more. To consider protein 8 e H and
protein a e G as putative functional orthologs, we require that a
is aligned to h under f, and that the BLAST e-value between a
and b is low. Finally, we consider only those pairs of aligned
proteins where b is not in the unique best BLAST hit of a, mean-
ing that this alignment would not necessarily have been deter-
mined by sequence alone. Further, the examples we consider
later in the text to be known functional orthologs, both share
some common biological function in their respective organisms
and are veriﬁed as isologs in the IsoBase (Park et al., 2011)
functional orthology database.

3.4.1 Known functional orthologs GHOST aligned the nuclear
hormone receptor family member nhr-67, a product of gene
nhr-67 in C. elegans to the tailless hormone receptor protein, a
product of gene tll in D. melanogaster. GO annotations with
experimental evidence codes implicate nhr-67 in cell migration,
gonad morphogenesis, regulation of growth rate, hermaphrodite
genitalia development and transcriptional regulation of an
RNA polymerase II promoter (GO:0016477, GO:0035262,
GO:0040010, GO:0040035 and GO:0045944). Meanwhile, the
tailless hormone receptor protein is also implicated in transcrip-
tional regulation of an RNA polymerase II promoter
(GO:0045944) as well as terminal region determination
(GO:0007275), gastrulation (GO:0007369), the torso signaling
pathway (GO:0008293), cell fate commitment (GO:0054165),
regulation of the cell cycle (GO:0051726) and neuroblast division
(GO:0055057).

GHOST also mapped the high mobility group protein DSPl, a
product of gene Dspl from D. melanogaster to the high mobility
group protein 1.2, a product of gene hmg-1.2 from C. elegans.

Biological Similarity (MF)

Fig. 3. Under both BP and MF GO aspects and both alignments, we observe a consistent trend in the quality of the solutions produced by the different
aligners. IsoRank produces alignments of reasonable biological, but poor topological quality, whereas MI-GRAAL exhibits the opposite behavior (i.e.
high topological, but poor biological quality). Natalie 2.0 and GHOST consistently produce alignments with competitive trade offs between the
competing goals of topological and biological quality, though GHOST’s alignments exhibit consistently higher topological quality

These proteins both play a role in the development and morpho-
genesis of their respective species. For example, experimentally
determined GO annotations implicate Dspl in segment speciﬁ-
cation, developmental process and leg disc development (GO:
0007379, GO:0032502 and GO:0035218) in D. melanogaster,
whereas hmg-1.2 is implicated in epithelium morphogenesis,
larval development, gonad development, embryo development,
body morphogenesis and regulation of growth rate (GO:
0002009, GO:0002119, GO:0009792, GO:0010171 and
GO:0040010) in C. elegans.

We also veriﬁed the alignment of Guanine nucleotide-binding
protein G(i) subunit alpha 65 A, a product of gene G—ialpha65A
in D. melanogaster with the Guanine nucleotide-binding protein
alpha-16 subunit protein, a product of gene gpa-16 in C. elegans.
Both of these proteins are experimentally determined to function
in protein binding (GO:0005515). More interestingly, however,
G—ialpha65A has been experimentally implicated in asymmetric
cell division, cell differentiation, asymmetric neuroblast division

and the establishment of spindle orientation (GO:0008356,
GO:0030154, GO:0055059 and GO:0055059), whereas gpa-16
has been directly experimentally implicated in embryotic axis spe-
ciﬁcation (GO:0000578), embryo development (GO:0009792)
and the establishment of mitotic spindle orientation (GO:
0000132). Again, we reiterate that none of these functional
ortholog examples uncovered by GHOST represent unique
best BLAST-hits of the protein to which they are mapped, and
thus they would likely not be uncovered by examining the se-
quences alone.

3.4.2 Putative novel functional orthologs In addition to the
recapitulation of known functional orthologs, we explore three
new pairs of potential functional orthologs. Again, we look for
proteins that are mapped to each other under the alignment,
where the protein from one network is not the unique best
BLAST hit to the mapped protein, suggesting that interaction
evidence led to their alignment. Unlike the conﬁrmed functional

Global network alignment using multiscale spectral signatures

 

orthologs earlier in the text, we do not require both the mapped
proteins we consider here to be conﬁrmed proteins with experi-
mentally validated function. Rather, the potential functional
orthology of these pairs warrants further study.

GHOST mapped the Dredd protein of D. melanogaster to the
csp-l protein of C. elegans. Although not top-ranked sequence
matches, these proteins share sequence similarities, and both
belong to the peptidase C14A homology family. The csp-l pro-
tein has no experimentally assigned GO terms, though proteoly-
sis (GO:0006580), apoptotic process (GO:0006915), cysteine-type
endopeptidase activity (GO:0004197) and cysteine-type peptidase
activity (GO:0008234) have been inferred from computational
annotation. Dredd, on the other hand, has a host of experi-
mentally determined GO terms, including apoptotic process
(GO:0006915) and cysteine-type endopeptidase activity (GO:
0004197). These facts both provide evidence that the electronic-
ally inferred GO terms of csp-l may be correct, and also suggest
that csp-l may be implicated in some of the other BP performed
with Dredd.

Another intriguing alignment pair produced by GHOST is
that of CG9238 in D. melanogaster to H18N23.2 in C. elegans.
In fact, although the latter of these proteins is merely ‘predicted’,
they both share the same recommended protein name—Protein
phosphatase 1 regulatory subunit 3. The D. melanogaster protein
is annotated with G0 terms for carbohydrate metabolic process
(GO:0005975), glycogen metabolic process (GO:0005977) and
behavioral response to ethanol (GO:0048149), whereas the
C. elegans protein is currently without any GO annotations.
The GHOST alignment acts as further evidence for the existence
and function of the C. elegans protein H18N23.2.

Finally, our alignment mapped the UGP protein from D. mel-
anogaster to the K08E3.5 protein from C. elegans. In this case,
each of these proteins was labeled as the corresponding element
(K00963) of the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
(KEGG) (Kanehisa et al., 2004) module for nucleotide sugar
biosynthesis in eukaryotes. Although the D. melanogaster protein
has no experimentally assigned GO terms, it has electronically
inferred annotations for metabolic process (GO:0008152) and
nucleotidyltransferase activity (GO:0016779). In addition to
sharing these electronically inferred annotations, the C. elegans
protein has experimentally assigned annotations linking it to
embryo development ending in birth or egg hatching
(GO:0009792), growth (GO:0040007) and positive regulation of
growth rate (GO:0040010). Their similar sequence, interaction
patterns, inferred annotations and placement in the nucleotide
sugar biosynthesis KEGG module suggest that these proteins
may act as functional orthologs in their respective organisms.

Although these novel putative functional orthologs warrant
further study and experimental support, an exploration of the
available evidence suggests that GHOST is positing reasonable
and meaningful biological hypotheses by aligning these pairs of
proteins. Further, we also demonstrated how GHOST was able
to recapitulate previously suggested functional orthologs whose
relationships are supported by a substantial amount of evidence.
In all of these cases, the alignment of these proteins is not owing
to their sequence similarity alone, suggesting that network align-
ment, in general, and GHOST, in particular, is a useful tool for
functional orthology detection.

3.5 Runtime

A tight upper bound on the asymptotic computational complex-
ity of the alignment algorithm used by GHOST remains an open
problem. The difﬁculty of the analysis is primarily owing to the
algorithm’s fundamental dependence on the structure of the
input networks and the density of aligned neighborhoods.
However, solving the spectral relaxation of the QAP is the step
of GHOST with the largest potential asymptotic complexity.
This step has worst-case running time 0((deH)2) where dG
and dH are the largest degrees in G and H, respectively. This
complexity results from the need to ﬁnd the dominant eigenvec-
tor of the largest quadratic assignment matrix, which is quadratic
in the size of the matrix (Kuczynski and Wozniakowski, 1992).
Despite the potential worst-case complexity, we ﬁnd that
GHOST is fast in practice. First, we note that the computation
of the spectral signatures is independent of the alignment being
performed. Thus, the signatures need only be extracted once and
can be reused for all alignments involving that organism. This
also allows for a quicker exploration of the parameter space be-
cause alignments can be performed under different parameter
settings without recomputing the spectral signatures. Extracting
the spectral signatures took 0.5 minutes for E. coli, 14 minutes for
C. jejuni, lminute for S. cerevisiae, lminute for A. thaliana and
218 minutes for D. melanogaster.

The time to perform the actual alignments, given the spectral
signatures, ranged between 1 and 6minutes depending on the
networks being compared. All timings were measured using 20
threads on a Java Virtual Machine instance given 16GB of
heap space. The testing machine had 8 Opteron 8356 processors
and 256GB of memory.

4 DISCUSSION

We have introduced GHOST, a novel framework for the global
alignment of biological networks. At the heart of GHOST is a
new spectral, multiscale node signature that we combine with a
seed-and-extend approach and a local search procedure to per-
form global network alignment. The spectral signature is highly
discriminative and robust to small topological variations. We
verify this robustness in Section 3.2 showing that GHOST out-
strips the competition in aligning the S. cerevisiae protein inter-
action network to noisier variants of itself. In these experiments,
as well as the self-alignment of the M. loti network, the accuracy
of GHOST is signiﬁcantly higher than that of either IsoRank or
MI-GRAAL. These experiments are of particular interest, as the
ground truth is known and the ability of different aligners to
uncover shared topological structure can be accurately measured.

We ﬁnd that the alignments produced by GHOST consistently
dominate those produced by the other aligners. When producing
an alignment of approximately the same biological quality,
GHOST yields alignments with substantially higher topological
quality than either IsoRank or Natalie 2.0. Furthermore, at a
similar level of topological quality, GHOST produces alignments
that have far more biological relevance than those produced by
MI-GRAAL. Finally, GHOST consistently produces alignments
that exhibit a more competitive trade off between topological
and biological quality than the other aligners we considered
(see Fig. 3).

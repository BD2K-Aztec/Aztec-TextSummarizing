Abstract

Summary: Conserved intron positions in eukaryotic genes can be used to reconstruct phylogenetic
trees, to resolve ambiguous subfamily relationships in protein families and to infer the history of
gene families. This version of GenePainter facilitates working with large datasets through options
to select specific subsets for analysis and visualization, and through providing exhaustive statistics.
GenePainter’s application in phylogenetic analyses is considerably extended by the newly imple-
mented integration of the exon—intron pattern conservation with phylogenetic trees.

Availability and implementation: The software along with detailed documentation is available at
http://www.motorprotein.de/genepainter and as Supplementary Material.

1 Introduction

The rapid growth of sequenced eukaryotes increasingly allows
incorporating exon—intron pattern information into phylogenetic
analyses. Conserved intron positions have helped resolving the rela-
tionship of taxonomic lineages (Grewe et al., 2013; Lehmann et al.,
2013) and have also extensively been used to reveal subfamily rela-
tionships within larger gene families (Du et al., 2013; Yan et al.,
2014) and to reconstruct ancient genes (Odronitz and Kollmar,
2008). Because the early eukaryotes were rather intron rich and the
gene structure evolution towards the extant species was dominated
by intron-loss events (Koonin et al., 2013), considerable taxonomic
and sequence sampling is necessary to reconstruct the gene structure
history of a gene or gene family across the eukaryotic tree of life.
For example, mammals and plants are known to have intron-rich
genomes, while most unicellular organisms are intron poor.
However, although the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae is known to
contain only N275 introns in total (Lopez and Séraphin, 2000), the
yeast’s dynein light chain LC8 coding region is split by two introns
(other ascomycetous fungi contain even up to seven introns) while
the human LC8 orthologs only contain a single intron. In general,
intron gain events are rare and are most often recent events (Li

et al., 2009). Existing tools for the comparison of gene structures
like Exalign (Pavesi et al., 2008), CIDA/CIWOG (Wilkerson et al.,
2009), GECA (Fawal et al., 2012) and GenePainter (Hammesfahr
et al., 2013) compare exon lengths or map intron positions to pos-
itions in multiple amino acid sequence alignments (MSA). However,
none of the tools integrates gene structure conservation with taxo-
nomic and phylogenetic tree information. Here, we present a new
version of our GenePainter software, v. 2.0, which maps intron pos-
itions onto the multiple sequence alignment and assigns intron gain
and loss events to taxonomic branches and extant species.

2 Features

2.1 Input files

The most accurate way to compare gene structures is to align the in-
tron positions based on corresponding protein sequence alignments
(Hammesfahr et al., 2013). GenePainter therefore requires a protein
MSA (fasta format) and corresponding gene structures (YAML or
GFF v. 3 format). For phylogenetic analyses, GenePainter by default
uses the NCBI taxonomy tree as reference tree (Federhen, 2012) but
user-provided trees can also be employed.

Fig. 1. (A) Representation of the human coronin gene structures from an alignment of 526 genes with introns highlighted. Exons are drawn to scale, while introns
are drawn length independent in colour. lntrons at the same nucleotide position get the same colour. To keep the alignment, exons in those genes not containing

an intron are split at the respective position. Alignment gaps are indicated as

light grey boxes. For better orientation, the conserved coronin- and coiled-coil do-

mains are indicated, which are separated by a region highly divergent in length and sequence. (B) The conservation of the introns in the human coronin genes
was analysed against 312 species from most major eukaryotic branches based on the NCBI taxonomy tree. The numbers of introns gained (first number) and lost
(second number plotted on branch) in human coronin genes are plotted on each branch. Statistics plotted on taxa refer to full dataset of 312 species (Color ver-

sion of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

2.2 Mapping introns onto taxonomy

For placing intron gain and loss events, GenePainter currently uses a
simple maximum parsimony model requiring the least intron-loss
events. The model is based on the assumption that it is highly unlikely
that introns would have independently been introduced at the exact
same sequence position with exact same reading frame in species
whose last common ancestor had lived hundreds of million years ago.
Thus, introns shared by the genes of two species are regarded as al-
ready been present in their last common ancestor and are marked as
intron gain events there. If species of sub-branches miss the respective
intron, an intron-loss event is marked for this branch.

2.3 Data selection and visualization

Visualization of hundreds of sequences with dozens to hundreds of
shared and unique intron positions becomes challenging. Therefore,
we implemented several different options for users to reduce the
visualized data, while statistics and intron gain and loss event map-
pings are still computed and provided for the whole dataset.

2.4 Output files

GenePainter v. 2.0 provides a number of output files such as an ex-
tended multiple sequence alignment, gene structure alignments
including a binary representation for evolutionary analyses, graph-
ical outputs on base-pair and other scales (Fig. 1A), scripts for map-
ping intron positions onto protein structures at user-provided
conservation levels, extensive statistics and an extended phylogen-
etic tree with intron gain and loss events plotted onto the respective
branches as svg (Fig. 1B) and in Newick format.

3 Example: coronin gene structure evolution

Analysis of 526 coronin class-I and class-II genes from 312 different
species representing major eukaryotic branches reveals introns with
relatively small taxonomic distribution as well as deeply conserved
introns. The deep conservation of many of the intron positions

becomes apparent when focusing on those positions present in at
least one of the human coronin genes (Fig. 1A). The six human coro-
nin genes contain together 17 different intron positions, of which
none is restricted to the genus Homo. Instead, six of these positions
are shared with fungal genes, indicating their presence in at least the
last common ancestor of the metazoa and fungi, whose divergence is
estimated to 700 up to 1500 million years ago (Chernikova et al.,
2011; Peterson et al., 2008). Five intron positions are even deeper
conserved, because they are shared between Opisthokonta and other
basal eukaryotic branches such as Alveolata, Stramenopiles and
Amoebozoa (Fig. 1B). Plotting all intron gain and loss events onto
the NCBI taxonomy tree reveals an intron-rich coronin gene in
the last common ancestor of the eukaryotes and the opisthokonts
(Fig. 1B). The many intron-loss events in, for example, the
Choanoﬂagellida and Platyhelminthes branches are most likely due
to the very low sequence and species sampling in these branches, but
may also be due to the low number of introns present in some of the
respective genomes in general. The actual CPU time used for this
computation was 38’27”, which reduced to 0’34” when using a pre-
compiled list of lineages instead of extracting the lineages of the 312
species from the complete NCBI taxonomic tree.

4 Implementation

GenePainter is a standalone tool written in Ruby and requires Ruby
v. 2 or higher. Python is required to convert the Newick tree format
into svg format and for invoking GenePainter output in PyMOL
(The PyMOL Molecular Graphics System, http://sourceforge.net/
projects/pymol). GenePainter has been tested under Linux, MacOS
and Windows.

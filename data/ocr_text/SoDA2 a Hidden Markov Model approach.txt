ABSTRACT

Motivation: The inference of pre-mutation immunoglobulin (lg)
rearrangements is essential in the study of the antibody repertoires
produced in response to infection, in B-cell neoplasms and in
autoimmune disease. Often, there are several rearrangements that
are nearly equivalent as candidates for a given lg gene, but have
different consequences in an analysis. Our aim in this article is to
develop a probabilistic model of the rearrangement process and
a Bayesian method for estimating posterior probabilities for the
comparison of multiple plausible rearrangements.

Results: We have developed SoDA2, which is based on a Hidden
Markov Model and used to compute the posterior probabilities of
candidate rearrangements and to find those with the highest values
among them. We validated the software on a set of simulated data, a
set of clonally related sequences, and a group of randomly selected
Ig heavy chains from Genbank. In most tests, SoDA2 performed
better than other available software for the task. Furthermore, the
output format has been redesigned, in part, to facilitate comparison
of multiple solutions.

Availability: SoDA2 is available online at https://hippocrates.duhs

1 INTRODUCTION

B cells express immunoglobulin (Ig) molecules on their outer
surface and secrete them into the extracellular space. Secreted
Ig is known as antibody. The genes that encode for antibodies
are generated by many diversifying mechanisms including combi—
natorial rearrangement of gene segments, addition of non—templated
(11) nucleotides at the junctions, and somatic hypermutation. This
circumstance presents the important challenge of inferring the
components of the original rearrangement for any observed Ig gene.
Because point mutations cause loss of information regarding the
original rearrangement, there may be multiple plausible solutions.
In this article, we present a Bayesian statistical method based on
a Hidden Markov Model (HMM) that allows a complete statistical

treatment of the problem by providing the posterior probability of
each possible rearrangement.

Antibodies serve as effector molecules that neutralize microbes by
binding to exposed antigens and targeting them to other components
of the immune system, such as phagocytic cells and complement,
that effect clearance. Ig genes generate diversity in two stages:
an antigen—independent and an antigen—dependent stage. Antigen—
independent diversity is generated in the bone marrow, where B
cells originate, by combinatorial rearrangement of gene segments
and junctional diversity. Combinatorial diversity is created in a
number of ways. First, each antibody molecule comprises one
heavy— and one light—chain protein. Both the light— and heavy—chain
genes are encoded by gene segments that are genetically rearranged
during a process known as V(D)J recombination (Sakano et al.,
1980; Tonegawa, 1983). Heavy chains are made up of three gene
segments—variable (VH), diversity (DH) and joining (JH) where
as light chains only have a V and J segment. In humans, there
are ~50 known functional VH segments, 27 known functional DH
segments, and six known functional JH segments (LeFranc, 2001).
This arrangement allows for ~8100 combinations in the heavy chain
alone. Humans also have two light—chain loci, K (Lorenz et al., 2001)
and A (Frippiat et al., 1995). Only one of these loci is expressed per
cell so that each antibody either has a K light chain or a A light chain.
Humans have 44 functional VK, 5 J K, 33 VA genes and 5 J A (LeFranc,
2001) resulting in 220 possible K chains and 165 possible A chains.
Thus this combinatorial rearrangement alone allows for greater than
3 million antibodies. Junctional diversity is the result of multiple
recombination site choices for each recombination event and the
addition of 11 nucleotides. 11 nucleotides are sometimes added at the
junction by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) between
adjoining gene segments (Desiderio et al., 1984). Although TdT is
believed to be expressed only in pro—B cells, the stage in which the
heavy—chain rearrangement takes place (Desiderio et al., 1984), the
presence of 11 nucleotides in light chains has also been seen in a few
studies (Bridges, 1998).

Antigen—dependent diversity is generated by somatic hyper—
mutation in the periphery in a manner dependent on activation—
induced cytidine deaminase (AID); during this process, mutations
in the Ig genes are accumulated at rate of up to 106 times the normal
background rate (Muramatsu et al., 2000). B cells are subsequently
selected for enhanced afﬁnity for the eliciting antigen. It is estimated
that these processes of diversiﬁcation can generate ~1012 different
antibodies making it challenging to correctly identify the underlying

germline gene segments and subsequently the sequences of the
complementarity determining regions (CDRs).

The inference of the recombination and mutation events that
produced a given Ig gene is of great importance in the study of
humoral immunity and has been tackled in many different ways.
The goal of such inference is to identify each of the component gene
segments used as well as the recombination sites, point mutations
and n nucleotides. The aligned gene segments usually overlap,
which is why alignments of the target gene to the individual gene
segments cannot be treated as independent. Somatic mutations, n
nucleotide addition and recombination site choice make this task
more challenging. The short length of the DH gene segment makes
it especially difﬁcult to identify the CDR3 region of the heavy chain,
which is the most diverse region in the antibody sequence. This
leads to many possible gene segment combinations that can result
in a given antibody gene. Hence, it is necessary to report all such
rearrangements and assign a probability to each of the combinations,
making it easy to compare all possible rearrangements.

Several algorithms have been developed for inferring Ig gene
segment composition. IMGT/V—QUEST is one of the ﬁrst and most
complete of these tools and has the ability to analyze both Ig
and TCR sequences for a variety of organisms including human
and mouse (Guidicelli et al., 2004). V—QUEST, however, is based
on the BLAST algorithm; it does not guarantee ﬁnding the best
alignment of two sequences (Altschul et al., 1990). Additionally,
the implementation of the algorithm only allows for running a
maximum of 50 sequences at a time. Another tool, J OINSOLVER,
is based on the identiﬁcation of conserved motifs in the target gene
(Souto—Carneiro et al., 2004). Both JOINSOLVER and V—QUEST
provide multiple gene segment possibilities but the implementation
only provides junction analysis for the topmost choice. Somatic
diversiﬁcation analysis (SODA) (Volpe et al., 2006) uses a 3D
alignment algorithm that allows for insertions and deletions. The
algorithm uses dynamic programming and is an extension of the
Smith—Waterman local alignment algorithm (Smith and Waterman,
1981). The 3D alignment allows for a continuous alignment through
all the states of the recombination. SoDA infers only a single hi ghest—
scoring alignment, and ignores other solutions that may have equal
or nearly equal scores. SoDA’s guarantee of optimality in the inferred
rearrangement is obtained at the cost of computational effort; SoDA
takes more CPU time than either JOINSOLVER or V—QUEST.
A major shortcoming for all the programs above is that they do
not provide a meaningful comparison of the different possible
rearrangements. iHMMune—align (Gaeta et al., 2007) partially solves
the problem and provides a probabilistic model using an HMM to
infer the rearrangement. iHMMune—align uses the Viterbi algorithm
(Rabiner, 1989) to ﬁnd the most probable path through the alignment
matrix, but does not sum over paths or provide results on sub—
optimal alignments. This choice becomes an issue when selecting
an appropriate DH gene segment for Ig heavy chains. The DH
gene is the shortest of all gene segments, and is typically the most
difﬁcult to align. We have found Ig genes that present an equally
good alignment with different DH genes (see Results section and
Figure 5). iHMMune—align or SoDA gives only the solution with the
highest score even if the highest score is not signiﬁcantly better than
the second highest score and so on (iHMMune—align does provide
the option of viewing the top 10 VH gene alignments, but not DH).

Among these four methods, only SoDA allows for gaps when
performing alignments, although insertions and deletions are known

to occur at non—negligible frequencies during somatic hypermutation
(Smith et al., 1996), and alignment without gaps when gaps are
present leads to dramatically erroneous inferences.

The method we are introducing here is an update of SoDA—
we call it SoDA2. It employs a probability mass function—based
alignment for determining gene segments and a probabilistic HMM
for the inference of CDR3. The system calculates the posterior
probability over all paths using a particular set of gene segments by
the forward and backward algorithms. It then provides the alignment
path with the highest posterior probability. If the sequence does not
hold enough information to unambiguously select a gene segment,
SoDA2 reports all alignments that do not differ signiﬁcantly. We
tested this method using a simulated dataset constructed from the
statistics of observed rearrangements and compared these results
with those obtained using existing methods. We also used two natural
datasets, a set of clonally related Ig genes and a random set of
sequences from NCBI. Each test indicates that SoDA2 provides the
most thorough and accurate results among all programs in addition
to providing the most statistically complete results.

2 METHODS
2.1 Determining the type of Ig

The ﬁrst step consists of aligning the target sequence with a consensus—like
sequence of the VH, VK and VA families to determine if the input sequence is
a heavy, kappa or lambda chain. These consensus sequences are pre—created
by separate alignments of the VH, VK and VA segments. We use the AHO
numbering scheme (Honegger and Plijckthun, 2001) which is based on the
spatial alignment of known 3D structures of Ig domains. The gaps are placed
to minimize the average deviation from the averaged structure of the aligned
domain so that the position of the CDRs remains consistent. The consensus is
represented by a probability mass function (pmf), a L x 5 matrix where L is
the length of the V genes in this case (Kepler et al., submitted for publication).
For each nucleotide position in the gene, we determine the frequency of use
for each nucleotide state (including ‘ gap’) at that position in the family. For
the target antibody, we create a similar pmf using the quality scores of the
input sequence. The quality score is proportional to the log probability of
the estimated sequencing error and is provided by the user’s base—calling
software (Ewing and Green, 1998). If quality scores are not provided, we
treat the input sequence as well—determined and all mismatches as due to
somatic mutation. The pmf at each position of the target sequence depends
on the quality score, which varies at each position, and a mutation frequency
)1. which is assumed to be constant over positions. For each position, we
then have the probability of observing the ﬁve bases (including a gap) at that
position given the quality score and the mutation frequency. We use the pmf
of the target antibody gene and the pmf of the VH, VK and VA sequences as
scores to create a local alignment (Kepler et al., submitted for publication;
Smith and Waterman, 1981).

2.2 V and J gene pre-alignment

Assume, for example, that our target sequence has been determined to be a
heavy chain. We use the trace—back path generated by aligning the pmf of
VH to our target and obtain the likelihood for each member of the VH family.
The mutation frequency )1. is recalculated after observing mismatches in the
highest scoring alignment. All VH segments with equally high likelihood
alignments are then submitted to the HMM. The position of the invariant
cysteine is determined.

The target sequence is then aligned past the invariant cysteine with all
the appropriate JH segments, using the pmf—based alignment mentioned
above. The JHs with the highest likelihood are selected for submission
to the HMM. The target sequence is further trimmed at the invariant

and lambda chains. The HMM starts at the last base of the invariant cysteine
of all high—likelihood V segments, runs through all DH segments in the case
of heavy chains, and through all high—likelihood J segments till the ﬁrst base
of the invariant tryptophan or phenylalanine.

tryptophan/phenylalanine, and only the remaining region, CDR3, is used
as our target sequence for the HMM. The 3/ ends (post—invariant cysteine)
of all signiﬁcant VH gene segments and the 5/ ends (before invariant
tryptophan/phenylalanine) of all JH segments from the pre—alignment are
also chosen for the HMM. Since DH segments are most difﬁcult to identify,
we submit all DH segments to the HMM. The mutation frequency of the ﬁnal
trimmed target sequence to be considered for the HMM is set at 1.5 it since
the CDR3 region is subject to higher mutation than the VH region (Cowell
et al., 1999; Gaeta et al., 2007). Figure 1 shows the basic set—up of the HMM
for heavy chains (Fig. 1a) and light chains (Fig. 1b) with an overview of the
states and allowed transitions.

2.3 HMM

We implemented a pair HMM with 10 non—silent states—match/mistmatch
state in V gene, insertion in V gene (Iv), deletion in V gene (Dv), V—D junction
n nucleotides, match/mismatch in DH gene, insertion in the DH gene (Id),
deletion in the DH gene (Dd), D—J junction n nucleotides, match/mismatch
in the J gene, insertion in the J gene (Ij) and deletion in the J gene (Dj).
Our HMM must begin in the match/mismatch state of the V gene since the
invariant cysteine is encoded by the V. The end state must be match/mismatch
in the J gene at the beginning of the invariant tryptophan/phenylalanine.

The emission probabilities in every state are determined by the pmf
calculated using the quality scores and the mutation rate u. For target
sequences with unknown quality scores, high—quality scores are assumed,
making the probability of the observed base depend only on u. Emission
probabilities for the n nucleotide states are determined based on empirical
data (Basu et al., 1983). Transition probabilities between states are
determined by ﬁtting a negative binomial distribution to the recombination
site choice for VH, DH and J H and number of n nucleotides in the junctions
as determined in a set of 293 unmutated sequences rearranged sequences
(Fig. 2, Jackson et al., 2004). Figure 3 shows a detailed implementation of
the HMM with transition probabilities.

2.4 Algorithm

Once we have the appropriately trimmed target and germline sequences, we
calculate the log of the total probability of a proposed rearrangement using the
forward and backward algorithms (Durbin et al., 1998; Majoras, 2007). We
select the gene segments that lead to the highest posterior probabilities, and
perform a posterior Viterbi algorithm with traceback (Fariselli et al., 2005)
to select the path with the highest posterior probability for each possible
rearrangement. We report the probability of the most probable path for each
of the equally probable gene segment sets. For a heavy chain, a DH gene
alignment of <3 nt is ﬂagged as ‘unreliable D alignment’. The functionality
of an antibody gene is determined as follows and reported with the results.
A functional Ig chain must have no stop codons and the invariant cysteine

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulated datasets

We created simulated datasets of 100 sequences each with
mutation frequencies of 2.5, 5, 10 and 20%. Recombination site
choice and number of n nucleotides for these simulations were
drawn from a negative binomial distribution. To avoid any bias
towards our HMM, the parameters for these simulations were
estimated using a set of 662 sequences obtained from Genbank.
Furthermore, rearrangements for these sequences were determined

using IMGT/V Quest (Guidicelli et al., 2004) rather than SODA or
SODA2. IMGT Junction Analysis was used tO determine empirical
data for deriving the distributions (MonOd et al., 2004). Mutations
were introduced such that the average mutation frequency across
the gene was 2.5, 5, 10 and 20%, and the mutation frequency in the
CDRs was 2X than that in the framework. Each Of these datasets
was used tO test SODA2, SODA, IMGT/VQuest, JOINSOLVER
and iHMMune—align. Inverted D segments were omitted from the
simulations because IMGT/V Quest and iHMMune—align dO not
allow for alignments against them. Table 1 shows the results Of
running our simulated datasets using the various available software.
The table shows the number Of rearrangements (all VH, DH and
JH with alleles) identiﬁed correctly at each mutation rate by each
program out Of the 100 sequences tested in each group. For all our
tests, we only compare the highest scoring rearrangement provided
by SODA2 with the highest scoring ones provided by other programs.
For our simulated data, we see that SODA2 performs better in
identifying the complete rearrangement (including correct alleles)
than other programs under all mutation rates (Table 1). In particular,
SODA2 outperforms all other programs in DH segment identiﬁcation
(Table 2). SODA2 falls slightly behind IMGT/V—Quest in VH
and JH gene identiﬁcation due tO the trade—Off between accuracy
and efﬁciency. We employ a computationally efﬁcient alignment
algorithm that aligns the target gene tO consensus sequences Of
alleles, which can lead tO the identiﬁcation Of the incorrect allele
in a very few cases. Aligning the target gene tO every allele would
decrease this error but increase computation time signiﬁcantly.
Such errors are seen rarely and dO not change the overall superior
performance Of SODA2 shown in Table 1. If the score for multiple
rearrangements is equal for any Of the programs, all rearrangements
are considered. Although SODA2s performance falls at the 20%
mutation rate, it still performs better than other software. We only

report all alignments that are equally probable and leave it up tO the
user tO select and view any number Of V, J or complete alignments
he or she wants.

For sequences where SODA2 failed tO identify the correct
rearrangement as the most probable one, we found a median
difference Of 0.67 in the natural log Of the probability between the
highest scoring rearrangement and the correct one at the 5 % mutation
rate. Thus, if allowed tO include rearrangements with low differences
(<1) in the natural log Of the probability from the tOp scoring
alignment, SODA2 would have identiﬁed correct rearrangements for
22 additional sequences at the 5% mutation rate, yielding a possible
87% success rate.

3.2 Clonally related datasets

In order tO test real biological data, we used two clonally related
datasets that were used tO test iHMMune—align (Gaeta et al.,
2007) derived from tonsilar IgD class—switched B cells (Zheng
et al., 2004). Because they are clonally related, sequences within
a given set should have identical rearrangements and differ only
by somatic mutation. We analyzed this dataset using VQuest,
JOINS OLVER, SODA and iHMMune—align tO determine the number
Of times each Of the programs resulted in the same rearrangement as
was done by Gaeta et al. (2007). We ran the sequences through
all the programs and found that iHMMune—align selected 47/57
identical rearrangements for the ﬁrst group Of sequences, while
SODA2 selected 34/57 identical rearrangements. IMGT/V Quest,
JOINSOLVER and SODA identiﬁed 37, 25 and 18 identical
rearrangements, respectively. SODA2 returned a minority DH gene
segment in 17 cases, a minority J H allele in ﬁve cases, and a minority
VH allele in four cases. In cases where SODA2 failed tO select the
majority VH or J H gene segment, all the other programs, including
iHMMune—align also failed tO select the majority gene segment.
It can be seen in these cases that mutation had obliterated the
information necessary tO make the correct inference. For the 17
cases where SODA2 did not return the majority DH segment, the
DH segment that was returned was typically judged more probable
than the majority segment due tO the balancing Of n—nucleotide use
and mutations. An example Of this phenomenon is the inference
for AF262199 (Fig. 4). In this case, the mutation frequency in
the VH gene segment is ~7%. SODA2 selects IGHD1~26*01
requiring three mutations (8.5% mutation frequency in CDR3)
and seven n—nucleotides, while IGHD7~27*01 requires two
mutations (5.5% mutation frequency) and 10 n—nucleotides. For the
second dataset Of 99 sequences, both iHMMune—align and SODA2
identiﬁed 68/99 identical rearrangements while IMGT/V Quest,
JOINSOLVER and SODA identiﬁed 56, 41 and 37 identical
rearrangements, respectively.

3.3 Sequences from Genbank

We tested a set Of 662 sequences collected from Genbank and
previously used for testing iHMMune—align and SODA (Genbank
accession nos Z68345—487 and 280363—770). Out Of 662 sequences,
113 produced inferences on which all ﬁve programs agreed. There
was no agreement from any Of the programs on 140 sequences.
This means that they either could not infer a rearrangement at all
or they all differed in their inference. From the rest, SODA2 agreed
with the majority Of the programs on 300 rearrangements (Table 3).
These did not include those where SODA and SODA2 were the only

SODA2 performs considerably better than other programs in this
test. We closely examined sequences for which SODA2 failed to
agree with two or more programs. We found a median difference
of 1.05 between the top scoring rearrangement and the majority
rearrangement. We also found that in all cases, SODA2 selected an
alternative rearrangement equally likely as the majority one. Figure 5

probability, we found both the rearrangement chosen by the majority
of the programs (VQuest, J OINSOLVER and iHMMune—align,
Fig. 5b) and also the rearrangement selected by SODA (Fig. 50). The
difference in the natural log of the probability is 0.63 in the ﬁrst case
and 0.93 in the second. This shows that allowing rearrangements
within a reasonable range of probabilities in SODA2 would give an
accurate and thorough picture of the various rearrangements possible
for a given Ig sequence. It is important to note that SODA2 considers
factors such as recombination site choices for each gene segment and
numbers of 11 nucleotides at both junctions derived from empirical
data in inferring rearrangements while alignment algorithms used
by SODA, VQuest and J OINSOLVER base their results on sequence
similarity matrices which may not accurately represent the process
of V(D)J recombination.

4 CONCLUSION

The problem of inferring the correct rearrangement for antigen
receptors is difﬁcult due to the stochastic nature of the process, but
the task is important for an increased understanding of the population
somatic genetics of the immune response. In this paper we present
a method based on an HMM that provides a statistical basis for
identifying rearrangements of Ig genes. In addition to providing the
posterior probability of the top rearrangement candidate, SODA2
also provides the user with an Option to see all rearrangements
with sufﬁciently high posterior probabilities, thus giving the user
a statistically complete picture of the Observed sequence’s origins.
We tested SODA2 against simulated datasets that were created
using empirically Observed recombination site choices for each of
the gene segments and numbers of 11 nucleotides in the junctions.
We also tested it on two clonally—related datasets as well as a set
of Ig heavy chains chosen randomly from Genbank. Our software
performed as well as or better than available software on two
out of three validation tests. The one test where SODA did not
outperform all of the others involved a single rearrangement. On
the identical test with a different rearrangement, SODA did as
well as its nearest competitor. It is important to realize that the
key feature of this article is to provide a tool based entirely on a
probability model, and that therefore returns results interpretable as
posterior probabilities rather than arbitrary scores. As with other
inferential procedures, it is important to not only identify the
Optimal solution, but to identify near—Optimal solutions and have a

method for the absolute comparison among these alternatives. This
performance and thorough result reporting leads tO a substantially
longer computation time. SODA2 takes ~15 s Of real user time per
set Of V and J segment for a given heavy target sequence on a 64
bit machine with a 2.19GHz processor and 4 GB RAM, but the
investment Of computational effort seems worthwhile.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cell division in Escherichia coli is morphologically sym-
metric. However, as unwanted protein aggregates are segregated to
the cell poles and, after divisions, accumulate at older poles, generate
asymmetries in sister cells’ vitality. Novel single-molecule detection
techniques allow observing aging-related processes in vivo, over mul-
tiple generations, informing on the underlying mechanisms.

Results: CellAging is a tool to automatically extract information on
polar segregation and partitioning in division of aggregates in E.coli,
and on cellular vitality. From time-lapse, parallel brightfield and fluor-
escence microscopy images, it performs cell segmentation, alignment
of brightfield and fluorescence images, lineage construction and pole
age determination, and it computes aging-related features. We exem-
plify its use by analyzing spatial distributions of fluorescent protein
aggregates from images of cells across generations.

Availability: CellAging, instructions and an example are available at

1 INTRODUCTION

The division process of Escherichia coli is morphologically sym-
metric. In favorable environments, the process can be sustained
indeﬁnitely. However, to be sustainable, Ecoli needs to deal
with the accumulation of unwanted substances and degradation
of internal structures. Recent evidence suggests that in growing
populations of isogenic cells, there is a continuous emergence of
functional asymmetries in the Vitality of sister cells, which are
associated to the accumulation of unwanted protein aggregates
at the cell poles (Lindner et al., 2008). Namely, Ecoli appears to
use a bet-hedging strategy during cell division (Lloyd-Price et al.,
2012), in that the daughter cell inheriting the older pole of
mother cell (and the unwanted aggregates within) exhibits
slower growth and division rates, as well as an increased inci-
dence of death. A recent study observed this process, one event at
a time, showing that aggregates of RNA molecules tagged with
MS2—green ﬂuorescent protein, produced in the midcell region,

are quickly transported to the poles, where they remain there-
after (Lloyd-Price et al., 2012). Also, the choice of pole was
biased in that, on average, more aggregates moved toward the
older pole.

Little is known about the mechanisms underlying the process
of segregation and partitioning in division of unwanted aggre-
gates. In Lindner et a]. (2008), it was hypothesized that the lim-
ited diffusion of the aggregates, along with cell division and
nucleoid occlusion, may sufﬁce to explain the observations.
Other studies suggest that active transport mechanisms may be
involved (Rokney et al., 2009). To study these processes and
underlying sources, one needs to observe them in vivo, using
single-molecule Visualization techniques, in growing isogenic
cell populations over several generations.

Information extraction from time-lapse microscope images of
growing cell populations is fastidious and technically difficult. It
requires large data sets, involves multiple steps, such as cell seg-
mentation and tracking, and requires identifying, e.g. cell
lineages. Also, it is necessary to extract spatiotemporal distribu-
tions of ﬂuorescent proteins and quantify their partitioning in
divisions. There are tools available to perform some of these
steps, e.g. of cell segmentation (Carpenter et al., 2006).
However, some steps, e.g. cell tracking, remain problematic.
Also, no tool performs all the steps needed to, from the
images, outputting information on segregation to the cell poles
and partitioning on unwanted aggregates in cell division.

We present CellAging, a tool that performs segmentation of
E.coli cells in brightfield images, aligns the segmentation results
with ﬂuorescence images of the same cells and establishes tem-
poral relationships between the cells. Additionally, CellAging
outputs both aging-related statistics of choice and the informa-
tion on the temporal evolution of the ﬂuorescence in each cell at
the pixel level in the established hierarchy of cells. The program
is operated Via a graphical user interface. Aside from studies of
cellular aging, it allows studying the in viva dynamics of the
spatial distribution and the partitioning in division of any ﬂuor-
escence-tagged intracellular elements. An example application is
provided in supplement, along with a detailed description of the
methods used by CellAging.

segmentation is seeded by Gradient Path Labeling (Mora et al, 2011),
and it relies on classiﬁers for merging and discarding segments. The clas-
siﬁers were constructed using the Classiﬁcation and Regression Trees
algorithm (Breiman et al., 1984), and they were trained by an expert
(Queimadelas et al, 2012). Inter-frame information is used to enhance
the quality of the segmentation. After the automated segmentation, the
results can be manually corrected. As a side note, we observed that
CellAging, because of thorough training, and given consistency between
images from multiple time series, consistently outperformed currently
available state-of—the-art tools for the set of images that we produced
in laboratory Carpenter et al. (2006); Young et al. (2011).

CellAging then automatically aligns the ﬂuorescence images with the
segmentation results. Then, it ﬁnds cell divisions and establishes the cor-
respondence of the same cells between consecutive frames (Supplemen-
tary Material). We observed that the number of errors in this step is
negligible in the images used in our case study (<1%). The result can
be Visualized by a graphical tool, from which features can be selected and
exported.

There are three categories of features (see manual). Features relative to
time series of individual cells include their area, total ﬂuorescence inten-
sity, bias in intensity of old and new poles and the distribution of ﬂuor-
escence along the major axis of the cell. These features are extracted as a
function of time. Features relative to cell division include the area and the
total ﬂuorescence of the mother cell, when last observed, its division time
and the bias in daughter cell areas or intensities after their appearance.
Features relative to cell populations include mean cell area and mean
ﬂuorescence intensity during their lifetime, the bias in ﬂuorescence inten-
sity in the frame where the cells were ﬁrst or last observed and the division
time of each cell. From the exported results, one can either extract the full
distribution of values or calculate statistics, such as mean and standard
deviation.

The set of features calculated is intended to sufﬁce to study segregation
and partitioning in division of unwanted protein aggregates and conse-
quence aging. However, to ensure applicability of CellAging for other
aims, one can extract the information on the temporal evolution of each
cell at a pixel level, along with the information on the relationship
between the cells and on the orientation of the poles of cells born
during the measurement period.

In supplement, we exemplify the usage of CellAging (exempliﬁed in
Fig. 1) by analyzing images of E.coli K-12 strain SX4 cells harboring the
tsr-venus gene under the control of lac promoter (Yu et al., 2006), a gift

from Sunny Xie, Harvard University, USA. The supplement also features
a performance analysis of the segmentation, a description of the align-
ment of brightﬁeld and confocal images and a description of the con-
struction of lineages. Finally, we describe the strain, induction of the
target gene and microscopy imaging.

3 DISCUSSION

CellAging is the ﬁrst tool made available to assist studies of
cellular aging using the model organism E.coli. We expect it to
be valuable in future studies, as it allows automated high-
throughput analysis of large amounts of data and unbiased
comparisons between independent measurements in identical
and different conditions.

CellAging provides information on the temporal evolution of
many variables associated to cellular aging at three levels of
detail: time series, cell divisions and population statistics.
Additionally, it can also extract information at a lower level of
detail, namely, temporal information on the ﬂuorescence at a
pixel level in each cell. Given the wide-spread usage of ﬂuores-
cent proteins, including in studies of gene expression dynamics
and cell morphology, we expect CellAging to have a wide range
of applicability. Provided some modiﬁcations, CellAging may
also contribute to studies of cellular aging focusing on mitochon-
dria, given its similar shape to E.coli and bacterial origin and,
thus, similar mechanisms associated to aging (Youle and van der
Bliek, 2012). It also may be of use in studies of gene expression
(Kandhavelu et al, 2012) or protein localization.

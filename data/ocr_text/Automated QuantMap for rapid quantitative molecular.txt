ABSTRACT

Summary: The previously disclosed QuantMap method for grouping
chemicals by biological activity used online services for much of the
data gathering and some of the numerical analysis. The present work
attempts to streamline this process by using local copies of the
databases and in-house analysis. Using computational methods
similar or identical to those used in the previous work, a qualitatively
equivalent result was found in just a few seconds on the same dataset
(collection of 18 drugs). We use the user-friendly Galaxy framework to
enable users to analyze their own datasets. Hopefully, this will
make the QuantMap method more practical and accessible and
help achieve its goals to provide substantial assistance to drug
repositioning, pharmacology evaluation and toxicology risk
assessment.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding interrelationships between drugs, toxins and
other chemicals is an important part of discovering new ways
to make better medicines, avoid toxicity or achieve any of a
variety of goals for systems chemical biology (Oprea et al.,
2007). For many applications, chemicals are commonly com-
pared structurally according to computed or measured properties
(Duffy et al., 2012). Another method is to compare the associ-
ations with biological systems. One notable application of this
method is the connectivity map, which relates biologically active
chemicals to gene-expression data (Lamb et al., 2006). Our
published QuantMap method explores the connections of
chemicals to proteins through protein—protein networks
(Edberg et al., 2012).

In this article, we adapt the partially manual QuantMap
method to a rapid automated system with an easy-to-use
interface, opening up for moderately larger datasets as well as
integration with other tools in batch analysis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

Chemical to protein relationships were taken from STITCH 3
(Kuhn et al., 2012) through the ‘chemical.aliases.v3.1’ and ‘protein_
chemicallinks.detailed.v3.1’ tables available from http://stitch.embl.de.
Protein to protein relationships (PPI data) were taken from STRING
9.0 (Szklarczyk et al., 2011) through the ‘protein.links.detailed.v9.0’
table available from http://string.embl.de. In both cases, taxonomy was
limited to human (designated as 9606) for the current application.
MySQL 5.5 (http://www.mysql.com) was used for building the local data-
bases. Chemical identiﬁers (CIDs) and names generally correspond to
PubChem (http://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov) but are strictly limited to
those found in STITCH 3.

2.2 Tools developed

QuantMap automation has been implemented in the Galaxy platform
(Blankenberg et al., 2010; Giardine et al., 2005; Goecks et al., 2010) as
a separate tool for data preparation and main calculation.

The data preparation tool (named ‘QuantMap Prep’) was written in
Perl (http://perl.org) for ease of text processing. This tool checks the list
of input chemicals against the local STITCH database. Common names
and CIDs known to STITCH are accepted and a table of acceptable
CIDs with names is returned. Chemicals that cannot be found will be
omitted from the next stage.

The main QuantMap tool (named ‘QuantMap Server’) was imple-
mented in R (http://www.R-project.org/) for access to network analysis
tools. QuantMap Server approximates the procedure and parameters
described in Edberg et al. (2012) and outlined in the Supplementary
Figure S1.

For each chemical (CID) cleared in the data preparation step:

(1) Retrieve a list of 10 proteins (‘seeds’) closely associated with the
current chemical from the local STITCH database. STITCH’s
overall score with a minimum conﬁdence of 0.7 is used as the
measure of association.

(2) Retrieve a list of up to 150 proteins associated with these proteins
(PPI data) from the local STRING database. STRING’s overall
score with a minimum conﬁdence of 0.7 is used as the measure of
association.

(3) Calculate relative importance of the proteins in the PPI network as
described in Section 2.3.

(4) Condense the importance calculations to a single list ranked by the
median of the importance measures.

The ranked lists were combined using Spearman’s foot rule (Diaconis and
Graham, 1977). This array of pairwise distances was analyzed by hier-
archical clustering with hclust (complete) from the STATS package of R.

This clustering technique did not require the multidimensional scaling
used in the previous work.

2.3 Centrality measures (network topology)

In Edberg et al. (2012), the relative importance of the proteins
(represented as nodes in a network) for a single chemical was modelled
by the centrality measures: betweenness, node degree, edge percolation
component and bottleneck betweenness. These were matched or approxi-
mated in the R package igraph (Csardi and Nepusz, 2006) by the func-
tions degree (number of connections to a node), betweenness (number of
shortest paths through a node) and subgraphcentrality (number of
subgraphs with a node, weighted by size of subgraph) based on compu-
tational similarity and rank correlation for a number of test compounds
(unpublished data).

3 RESULTS

The QuantMap group of tools, encompassing QuantMap Prep
and QuantMap Server, are available from the main menu of our
Galaxy server (http://galaxy.predpharmtox.org). A list of chem-
icals identiﬁed by name or CID can be loaded into the text ﬁeld
of QuantMap Prep, which checks the names for applicability to
the system. QuantMap Server is then run from the result of the
preparation job. All chemicals with adequate PPI (according to
step 2 of Section 2.2) will be used to produce a plot of the bio-
logical interrelationships.

We demonstrate the automated QuantMap system using a
dataset identical to the one used by Edberg et al. (2012), specif-
ically for Estradiol, Diethylstilbestrol, Tamoxifen, Raloxifene,
Fulvestrant, Genistein, Coumestrol, Resveratrol, Bisphenol A,
4-Nonylphenol, Dibutyl phthalate, Zearalenone, Endosulfan,
Glimepiride, Rosiglitazone, Aspirin, Ibuprofen and Diclofenac.

The dendrogram of Figure 1 shows the results of QuantMap
Server applied to this dataset. Qualitatively, this ﬁgure is largely
equivalent to the results by Edberg, such as the lone dibutyl
phthalate and groupings of NSAIDs (Aspirin, Diclofenac
and Ibuprofen) and antidiabetic drugs (Glimepiride and
Rosiglitazone). The other compounds form a more complex pat-
tern similar, but not identical, to the previous work. Differences
could be due to the use of different centrality measures, as
described earlier in the text. See Edberg et al. (2012) for a general
discussion of the results.

The execution time for this analysis was on the order of a few
seconds. The speed advantage over a partially manual procedure
is considerable. The possibility to create workﬂows in Galaxy
and other types of automation compounds the beneﬁts to help
make this automated QuantMap system more practical and
accessible.

Fig. 1. Dendrogram produced by QuantMap Server from the dataset
used in this study. The compound list was run through QuantMap
Prep to make a data table for QuantMap Server. Compounds separated
by fewer branches are more similar to each other from a biological, rather
than chemical, perspective. For cleaner display, short branches were
ﬂattened to approximate multibranching with di2multi in APE (Paradis
et al., 2004)

ABSTRACT

Summary: We have developed a web-based query tool, Whole-
Genome rVISTA (WGRV), that determines enrichment of transcription
factors (T F3) and associated target genes in sets of co—regulated
genes. WGRV enables users to query databases containing pre—com-
puted genome coordinates of evolutionarily conserved transcription
factor binding sites in the proximal promoters (from 100 bp to 5 kb
upstream) of human, mouse and Drosophila genomes. TF binding
sites are based on position-weight matrices from the TRANSFAC
Professional database. For a given set of co—regulated genes,
WGRV returns statistically enriched and evolutionarily conserved bind-
ing sites, mapped by the regulatory VISTA (rVISTA) algorithm. Users
can then retrieve a list of genes from the query set containing the
enriched TF binding sites and their location in the query set promoters.
Results are exported in a BED format for rapid visualization in the
UCSC genome browser. Flat files of mapped conserved sites and
their genomic coordinates are also available for analysis with stand-
alone software.

1 INTRODUCTION

Methods for transcriptome analysis (e. g. microarray and RNA
sequencing) have revolutionized our ability to identify global
changes in mRNAs during cellular remodeling. A continuing
challenge for such analyses is identifying the key signaling
events that mediate the observed gene expression changes.
Transcription of mRNA is a dynamic process controlled by
many factors, including chromatin states, cofactors, RNA poly-
merase and the dynamic regulation of transcription factors
(TFs). The Gene Ontology Consortium has classiﬁed ~1030

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

human TF genes that encode for proteins with sequence-speciﬁc
DNA-binding activity.

TFs, by their very nature, are key regulators of the observed
transcriptional changes during cellular remodeling. TFs can be
regulated post-transcriptionally (e. g. by phosphosphorylation
and/or changes in intracellular location), and thus may not be
altered in expression alongside their target genes. The enrichment
of TF binding sites (TFBS) near target genes, however, can be
used as a surrogate for predicting altered TF activity. Thus, we
developed Whole-Genome rVISTA (WGRW, a web-based tool
for ﬁnding overrepresented evolutionarily conserved TF BS
within the proximal promoter regions of a set of differentially
expressed genes.

Searching proximal promoters for TF BS often results in many
false positives. This is because the positional weight matrices that
are used to computationally predict TF BS are often short in
length and degenerate at speciﬁc positions. The use of phylogen-
etic footprinting to ﬁlter TFBS that are conserved in gene pro-
moters between two relatively closely related species has been
shown to signiﬁcantly reduce false positive sites (Loots et al.,
2002).

Chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by high-content
sequencing (ChIP—seq) has emerged as the method of choice
for determining bona ﬁde TFBS (Mardis, 2007). ChIP—seq stu-
dies, however, require a priori knowledge of the TF for which
binding sites are to be determined. Moreover, such studies re-
quire a validated antibody and can be costly and time-consum-
ing. WGRV queries are fast compared with ChIP—seq
experiments, and the queries can be carried out simultaneously
for all TFBS stored in the database at no cost. We believe
WGRV is an excellent method to computationally identify po-
tentially relevant TFs that drive tissue and cellular remodeling,
which can then be followed up with ChIP—seq for further
validation.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

We initially developed the WGRV algorithm to identify the en-
richment of cyclic AMP-responsive elements in clustered murine
transcripts altered by protein kinase A activation (Brudno et al.,

2007; Zambon et al., 2005). The capabilities of WGRV have now
been signiﬁcantly enhanced. WGRV is now available for human,
mouse and Drosophila TF target analysis. It incorporates map-
pings for all TFBS matrices in the most current TRANSFAC
Professional database (Matys et al., 2006). As described later, we
have incorporated a number of enhanced input and output fea-
tures, and we compare WGRV performance with existing tools
using publicly available ChIP-seq and microarray data.

WGRV uses the VISTA/LAGAN alignment pipeline
(Dubchak et al., 2009) to ﬁrst align whole-genome assemblies
of two related species (Table l).

The rVISTA algorithm (Loots et al., 2002) is then applied to
identify all the conserved TFBS within the 5kb proximal pro-
moter regions of every orthologous gene mapped between the
two species. Conserved TF BS (cTF BS) must exhibit ﬂanking
sequence conservation between species (see details in the
Supplementary Methods). These results are stored in a database
that can be queried over the web using a list of genes (e. g. genes
signiﬁcantly up- or down-regulated between two conditions
in a microarray or high-content sequencing experiment).
Alternatively, ﬂat ﬁles are available (http://pipeline.lbl.gov/
data/conserved_tfbs/) that can be incorporated in overrepresen-
tation analysis software (e.g. GO-Elite; Zambon et al., 2012).

WGRV users can query lists of co-regulated genes for enrich-
ment of cTF BS via a web interface (Supplementary Fig. 1). Once
genes are submitted, the corresponding cTF BS are retrieved and
a binomial test is performed to determine whether any cTFBS
are overrepresented (at a user deﬁned P—value cutoff) in the pro-
moters of the submitted genes. Statistical enrichment is com-
puted by comparing the enrichment in the query set against all
aligned promoters in the genome or against a user-deﬁned back-
ground set (e.g. all the genes surveyed by a microarray).

Results include a list of enriched cTFBS sorted by P—value of
enrichment. The user can also view lists of predicted target genes
for each of the enriched TFs, the location of cTFBS on the
genome and VISTA conservation plots for each mapped gene
promoter that depicts the positional location of the enriched
cTF BS.

Overrepresented cTFBS can be exported to BED format for
easy upload and viewing on the UCSC genome browser. This
enables sites to be viewed alongside a wide variety of publicly
available data, such as histone modiﬁcations and ChIP-seq data
that are available at the UCSC genome browser. It also facili-
tates retrieval of ﬂanking genomic sequences for designing pri-
mers for ChIP-quantitative PCR validation studies. In addition
to the submission of gene lists, WGRV allows users to search the
database for all the mapped locations for any TF in the database.

and genomic regions outside of the 5 kb proximal promoters, can
be easily conducted using the rVISTA tool that is linked to
WGRV (Loots et al., 2002).

3 PERFORMANCE COMPARISON

There are several web-based tools for identifying enrichment of
cTFBS in gene lists, such as oPOSSUM (Ho Sui et al., 2007),
DiRE (Gotea and Ovcharenko, 2008) and CONFAC (Karanam
and Moreno, 2004). Signiﬁcant differences between WGRV and
these tools include (i) genome alignment methods, (ii) database
of TF matrices used, (iii) raw data access and (iv) data visual-
ization. These features and others are summarized in
Supplementary Table 1. We compared the capabilities of
WGRV with oPOSSUM, the most similar tool in terms of fea-
tures and output, to predict signiﬁcant enrichment of the TF
used in a number of published ChIP studies (Linhart et al.,
2008). Lists of TF target genes (Supplementary Data File 1)
were input into both the tools and identical query settings were
used (2000 bp upstream of the transcriptional start site and
P< 0.005). WGRV correctly identiﬁed the signiﬁcant enrichment
of TF sites in 9 of the 10 datasets compared with 3 of the 10
experiments correctly predicted by oPOSSUM (Supplementary
Table 2). Moreover, WGRV was able to rank the correct site in
the top ﬁve most signiﬁcant enriched TFs in 7 of the 10 datasets.

As a secondary performance comparison, we examined the
ability of WGRV, oPOSSUM and DiRE (Gotea and
Ovcharenko, 2008) to detect hypoxia-inducible factor (HIFl)
binding site enrichment in the promoters of 960 genes signiﬁ-
cantly up-regulated (fold >l.3, P<0.05, Supplementary Data
File 2) in cells cultured in hypoxia (1%02) for 8h (GSE27975)
(Perman et al., 2011). We hypothesized that genes up-regulated
in this dataset would contain an enrichment in HIFl binding
sites. WGRV identiﬁed HIFl as being the most signiﬁcantly
enriched TF BS in the query set promoters (Table 2). DiRE ana-
lysis also identiﬁed HIFl enrichment, but HIFl was listed the
28th out of 98 sites positively contributing to the enhancer
model. Using these input genes, oPOSSUM was not able to
identify signiﬁcant enrichment of HIF 1 sites.

If an increased fold cutoff (>2, P<0.05) is used to deﬁne the
query set, thereby decreasing the number of genes to 162, all
three tools were able to identify HIFl enrichment
(Supplementary Table 3). WGRV results, however, were not sig-
niﬁcantly different in terms of HIF 1 ranking or the total number
of enriched cTF BS. This is in stark contrast to oPOSSUM and to
a lesser extent to DiRE results.

In conclusion, WGRV is a robust tool to predict altered TF
activity and associated target genes from large lists of

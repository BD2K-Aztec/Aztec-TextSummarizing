ABSTRACT

Summary: Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have revolutio-
nized the search for the variants underlying human complex diseases.
However, in a typical GWAS, only a minority of the single-nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) with the strongest evidence of association is
explained. One possible reason of complex diseases is the alterations
in the activity of several biological pathways. Here we present a web
server called Pathway and Network-Oriented GWAS Analysis to
devise functionally important pathways through the identification of
SNP-targeted genes within these pathways. The strength of our meth-
odology stems from its multidimensional perspective, where we com-
bine evidence from the following five resources: (i) genetic association
information obtained through GWAS, (ii) SNP functional information,
(iii) protein—protein interaction network, (iv) linkage disequilibrium and
(v) biochemical pathways.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) aim to discover a
subset of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) that are asso-
ciated with the onset and progression of complex disease pheno-
types at a genome-wide scale. These studies have produced
extraordinary successes in the past few years, with numerous
new genetic variants identified with levels of signiﬁcance that
were once thought impossible to reach (Visscher et al., 2012).
Standard GWAS approaches focus on single SNP analysis,
and hence, it is difficult to incorporate weakly associated SNPs
(Ball, 2011). For multifactorial diseases, this incorporation is es-
pecially important because no particular variant on a particular
gene may have a strong effect, but the combination of the mul-
tiple variants with small effects on the polygenic disease explains

the overall susceptibility to disease (Cirulli and Goldstein, 2010).
In this regard, pathway-based approaches to GWAS, in which
prior biological knowledge is integrated into association studies
and sets of genes are analyzed simultaneously for association
with a disease, have been proposed recently (Peng et al., 2010).

Because the analysis of single variants within isolated genes is
not informative enough to explain the underlying disease mech-
anisms, another recent trend to further mine GWAS data is to
integrate protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks (Schadt and
Bjorkegren, 2012). Following a systems biology approach, these
methods evaluate the pairwise or collective effects of genetic vari-
ants, where the functional consequence of each susceptibility
allele may interfere with the interaction between pairs of pro-
teins. A few studies available to date on the identification of
the molecular interaction networks associated with the GWAS
genes indicated that this approach can help to discover formerly
unknown mechanisms underlying human diseases at the molecu-
lar level (Bebek et al., 2012).

To better understand the biological processes underlying com-
plex diseases, we also considered the functional effect of a typed
SNP in GWAS. Although the DNA polymorphisms that change
protein function can have signiﬁcant consequences, other types
of SNPs, such as synonymous SNPs, do not have such serious
effects in disease development mechanism. Functionally import-
ant SNPs, such as those that change amino acids, splicing sites;
those that lead to gain or loss of stop codon; those that result in
frame shift; and those that are found in regulatory region, are
priority targets in disease studies and large-scale genotyping pro-
jects (Calabrese et al., 2009). Hence, we decided that SNP func-
tional knowledge is valuable information to strengthen our
pathway and network-oriented GWAS analysis (PANOGA)
method.

To support the steps from SNP functionalization into PPI
network analysis to functional enrichment in a single program,
we developed a web server for post-GWAS analysis called
PANOGA. With its multifactorial basis, PANOGA has a good
potential to decipher the combination of biological processes
underlying disease. PANOGA has been tested on several com-
plex diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis (Bakir-Gungor and
Sezerman, 2011), intracranial aneurysm (Bakir-Gungor and
Sezerman, 2013), epilepsy (Bakir-Gungor et al., 2013) and
Behcet’s disease (Bakir-Gungor et al., 2012), and proved to be

useful. Throughout the time, the method has evolved with our
efforts (Bakir-Gungor and Sezerman, 2012). This web server pre-
sents the latest version of PANOGA.

2 METHODS

For a given SNP that was found signiﬁcant in a GWAS, ﬁrst, the func-
tional scores are fetched from The Functional Single Nucleotide
Polymorphism (F-SNP) (Lee and Shatkay, 2008) and SPOT (Saccone
et al., 2010) servers. F-SNP obtains the functional consequence of a
SNP from multiple tools at splicing, transcriptional, translational and
post-translational levels. SPOT score takes into account the effect of a
SNP on the gene transcript (e.g. non-sense, frameshift and 5’ - and
3’ -UTR), the impact of an amino acid substitution on the protein product,
evolutionary conserved regions and all possible linkage disequilibrium
proxy SNPs with r2 over a predeﬁned threshold in a speciﬁc HapMap
sample (Saccone et al., 2010). Second, PANOGA combines the functional
score and the GWAS P—value of a SNP and obtains PW-values. Among all
known SNP/gene transcript designations, the SNP is associated with the
gene on which the SNP has the most important functional effect. Third,
PANOGA transfers PW-values of SNP to its associated gene.

During the network-oriented steps of PANOGA, genes with PW-values
are mapped into a human PPI network. Next, PANOGA ﬁnds connected
sub-networks of the PPI network that has high total signiﬁcance of geno-
typic P—values of the disease-predisposing SNPs with respect to the con-
trols. To check for the biological relevance of the identiﬁed sub-networks,
PANOGA performs functional enrichment. Finally, PANOGA inte-
grates the functional enrichments of the generated sub-networks. The
overview of PANOGA methodology is presented in Supplementary
Figure S1. The Web site is implemented in HTML/PHP; operations are
made with Java on the server side.

3 SERVER DESCRIPTION

PANOGA web server accepts GWAS results including reference
SNP ID (rs#) and genotypic P—value of association for each
tested SNP, as shown in Figure 1A. It is important to note
that the PANOGA web server does not require individual geno-
types, odds ratio, minor allele frequency or conﬁdence intervals
computed in a GWAS, which can have ethical considerations.

PANOGA outputs SNP-targeted pathway and gene tables
(Supplementary Tables Sl—S4), and customized pathway maps,
as shown in Figure 1B. SNP-targeted pathway tables of
PANOGA present the number of associated SNPs from
GWAS, the number of regulatory SNPs among the disease-
predisposing SNPs, the number of SNP-targeted genes and the
number of sub-networks that this pathway is found to be statis-
tically signiﬁcant.

The gene table of PANOGA includes the genes that are part of
a functionally important pathway and at the same time identiﬁed
in a sub-network. For each such gene, this table presents gene
symbols, Entrez gene ID, number of times found in sub-network,
number of associated pathways, list of associated pathways,
number of typed SNPs in GWAS, functional information of
the typed SNPs in GWAS, SNP regulatory potential and
number of regulatory SNPs.

Customized Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes
pathway maps of PANOGA, as shown in Figure 1C, enrich
the utility of PANOGA results. These pathway maps help the
users to visualize affected genes along different routes within the
pathway map.

link from the results page for customized Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes pathway maps opens the zoomed-in version for visual
display (C). The shade of red color in genes indicates the number of
targeted SNPs (typed in the GWAS of disease) per base pair of the

gene product not targeted by the SNPs

4 CONCLUSIONS

PANOGA is a web server with multiple functions that support
pathway and network-oriented SNP—phenotype association ana-
lysis in a single system without requiring any additional manual
processes. PANOGA represents a feasible solution for the iden-
tiﬁcation of SNP-targeted pathways (candidate causal pathways)
to bridge the gap between GWAS and biological mechanisms of
complex diseases.

Abstract

Motivation: We introduce TRanslational ONCOIogy (TRONCO), an open—source R package that im—
plements the state—of—the—art algorithms for the inference of cancer progression models from
(epi)genomic mutational profiles. TRONCO can be used to extract population—level models describ—
ing the trends of accumulation of alterations in a cohort of cross—sectional samples, e.g. retrieved
from publicly available databases, and individual—level models that reveal the clonal evolutionary
history in single cancer patients, when multiple samples, e.g. multiple biopsies or single—cell
sequencing data, are available. The resulting models can provide key hints for uncovering the evo—
lutionary trajectories of cancer, especially for precision medicine or personalized therapy.
Availability and implementation: TRONCO is released under the GPL license, is hosted at http://

1 Introduction

Cancer develops through the successive expansions of clones, in
which certain (epi)genomic alterations, called drivers, confer a fit-
ness advantage and progressively accumulate, in a conteXt of overall
scarcity of resources (Nowell, 1976). Specifically, in Nowell’s sem—
inal work, tumor evolution is described in terms of stepwise genetic
variation such that growth advantage is the key for the survival and
prorogation of the clones. Therefore, one can define cancer progres-
sion models, in terms of probabilistic causal graphical models,
where the conditional dependencies and the temporal ordering

among these alterations are described, revealing the evolutionary
trajectories of cancer at the (epi)genome level.

We further distinguish (Caravagna et al., 2015) (i) ensemble-level
progression models, describing the statistical trends of accumulation
of genomic alterations in a cohort of distinct cancer patients. Such
models describe the temporal partial orders of fixation and accumula—
tion of such alterations and represent population—level trends; and (ii)
individual-level models, thus accounting for the specific evolutionary
history of cancer clones in individual tumors. Such models thus im—
pute the ancestry relations of the observed clones.

Even if the inference of such models is further complicated by a
series of theoretical and technical hurdles, such as, e.g. intra- and in-
ter-tumor heterogeneity and the effective detection of drivers, it can
benefit from the increasing amount of next-generation sequencing
data, currently available through public projects such as The Cancer
Genome Atlas (TCGA, https://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov). Usually, such
databases provide cross-sectional (epi)genomic profiles retrieved from
single biopsies of cancer patients, which can be used to extract ensem—
ble—level models; but higher—resolution data such as multiple-biopsies,
or even single-cell sequencing data, are becoming more accessible and
reliable, which can be used to infer individual—level models.

Here, we introduce TRanslational ONCOlogy (TRONCO), an
R package built to infer cancer progression models from heteroge—
neous genomic data (in the form of alterations persistently present
along tumor evolution.) Currently, TRONCO provides the imple—
mentation of two algorithms: (i) CAncer PRogression Extraction
with Single Edges (CAPRESE) (Olde Loohuis et al., 2014) and (ii)
CAncer PRogression Inference (CAPRI) (Ramazzotti et al., 2015 ),
both based on Suppes’ theory of probabilistic causation (Suppes
1970), but with distinct goals and properties (see Section 2).

TRONCO, in its current form and perspective, should be thought
of as a tool that provides the implementation of up—to—date solutions
to the progression inference problem. At the time of the writing it can
be effectively used as the final stage of a modular pipeline for the ex-
traction of ensemble—level cancer progression models from cross—sec—
tional data (Caravagna et al., 2015 ). In such a pipeline input data are
pre—processed to (i) stratify samples in tumor subtypes, (ii) select
driver alterations and (iii) identify groups of fitness—equivalent (i.e.
mutually exclusive) alterations, prior to the application of the CAPRI
algorithm. The resulting ensemble—level progression models depict the
evolutionary dynamics of cancer, with translational impacts on diag—
nostic and therapeutic processes, especially in regard to precision
medicine and personalized drug development.

From the complementary perspective, TRONCO can also ex—
ploit the CAPRESE algorithm to infer the clonal evolutionary his—
tory in single patients when multiple samples are available, as in the
case of multiple biopsies and/or single—cell sequencing data, as long
as the set of driver events is selected; see Caravagna et al. (2015).

2 Software implementation

TRONCO implements a set of R functions to aid the user in extract—
ing a cancer progression model from genomic data. At a high level,
these functions shall help to import, visualize and manipulate genomic
profiles—regardless of their source—eventually allowing the imple—
mented algorithms to run and assess the confidence in a model.

The basics steps of TRONCO’s usage are shown in Figure 1. In
Figure 1A, we show multiple input alterations (e.g. somatic muta—
tions or copy number alterations) either from a cohort of patients,
or a unique patient (e.g. multi—region or single-cell sequencing); in
Figure 1B we show an oncoprint visualization from the tool, i.e. a
matrix whose columns represent samples and rows the alterations
and their presence per sample; Figure 1C shows an inferred graph-
ical Bayesian progression model obtained with one of the available
algorithms; finally, in Figure 1D we show data supported for pro—
cessing in the tool. For a more detailed explanation of the implemen-
tation of the package see Antoniotti et al. (2015 ).

2.1 Data loading and manipulation
Common formats to store data used to extract progression models
can be natively imported. These include, for instance, the Mutation

Annotation Format (MAF) for somatic mutations, as well as the
Genomic Identification of Significant Targets in Cancer (GISTIC)
format to store focal Copy Number Variations. The tool can exploit
the cBio portal for Cancer Genomics, which collects among others
TCGA projects, to access freely available instances of such data
(Cerami et al., 2012).

TRONCO provides functions for data preprocessing to, e.g. se—
lect a certain subset of alterations, or samples or any abstraction
which might be appropriate according to the cancer being studied.

2.2 Visualization and interaction with other tools

TRONCO implements an oncoprint system to visualize the pro—
cessed data. Datasets can be exported for processing by other tools
used to, e.g. stratify input samples and detect groups of mutually ex—
clusive alterations, which include the Network-Based Stratification
(Hofree et al., 2013) and MUTEX (Babur et al., 2015) tools.
TRONCO allows the visualization of the inferred models.

2.3 Model inference and confidence
TRONCO provides two algorithms: (i) CAPRESE, which uses a
shrinkage—like estimator to infer tree—models of progression, and (ii)
CAPRI, which extracts more general direct acyclic graphs (DAG)—
thus allowing for confluent evolution and complex hypothesis test—
ing—by combining bootstrap and maximum likelihood estimation.
CAPRESE and CAPRI both rely on the same theory of probabilistic
causation, but with distinct goals and properties. The former recon-
structs tree models of progressions, while the latter does so for gen—
eral directed acyclic graphs. Both methods are agnostic to the type
of input data (i.e. whether it is an ensemble or an individual tumor),
but shall be used differently in different contexts as they produce dif—
ferent types of models. Indeed, CAPRESE is better at extracting cancer
evolution in a single individual as in that case trees capture branched
evolution and trunk events, which shall suffice to describe clonal evo—
lution. Instead, when heterogeneity might result in multiple evolution—
ary routes with common downstream alterations, the underlying true
model is a graph, and CAPRI should be the tool of choice.

Whatever a model is, TRONCO implements a set of functions to
assess its confidence via (i) non—parametric, (ii) parametric and (iii)
statistical bootstrap.

3 Discussion

TRONCO provides up—to—date, theoretically well—founded, statis—
tical methods to understand the evolution of a cancer (ensamble—
level) or a single tumor (individual—level). The implemented
algorithms are demonstrably the state—of—the—art for the progression
inference problem, in terms of computational cost, scalability with
respect to sample size, accuracy and robustness against noise in the
data. The implementation makes straightforward the interaction
of TRONCO with other common bioinformatics tools, possibly
allowing the creation of a common suite of tools for cancer progres—
sion inference.

Finally, we refer to either Caravagna et al. (2015) or the
Supplementary materials for a demonstration of the usage of
TRONCO on real genomics data both at the ensemble—level and
individual—level progression models. In particular, this article out—
lines the capability of the methods to reproduce much of the current
knowledge on the progression for a set of cancer types, as well as to
suggest clinically relevant insights. Furthermore, we also provide
users with detailed manuals, vignettes and source code to replicate
all the analysis presented in the article plus others (case studies:

Fig. 1. (A) TRONCO can process either alterations (e.g. somatic mutations or wider chromosomal lesions) in a cohort of independent samples (top lolliplot dia-
gram), or a set of multiple snapshots from a unique patient (e.g. multi-region or single-cell, bottom panel). (B) Oncoprints allow the user to visualize the data that
the tool is processing. Regardless of the source, each row represents a certain alteration—at a custom resolution depending on the cancer under study—and
each column a sample. (C) A model inferred with the tool might outline cancer evolution occurring in a population ensemble or in an individual patient.
Graphically, alterations are represented as nodes with different colors (e.g. green mutations and blue homozygous deletions). Algorithms such as CAPRI allow
describing alterations with logical formulas, in an attempt to find their role as a ‘group' (see Ramazzotti et al., 2015 for details); we picture such groups with
dashed lines. In the panel, we show a hypothetical ensemble-level model predicting a selection pressure on two genes mapped to 17p13, TP53 and HM, as it may
be inferred by analyzing samples harboring either TP53/ch1 mutations or homozygous deletions in the cytoband where any of these two genes map, i.e. here for
purely explanatory cases we suppose just TP53, which maps to 17p13.1. The model suggests a trend of selection toward mutations in gene Y, which shall be inter-
preted as a set of preferential clonal expansions characteristic of the population of analyzed samples, involving alterations of the functions mapped to 17p13 and
Y. (D) TRONCO supports three data types. Custom data, which is supposed to be provided as a binary input matrix storing the presence (1) or absence (0) of a cer-
tain alteration in a sample. Or, standard data formats such as the MAF for somatic mutations, as well as the GISTIC format for focal Copy Number Variations.
Data can be generated by custom experiments, or collected—along with other ‘omics'—from public databases such as TCGA and cBio portal. For the latter, cBio
portal, TRONCO implements a query system to fetch data with minimal effort. The tool engine can then be used to manipulate genomic profiles—regardless of
their source—and run progression inference algorithms

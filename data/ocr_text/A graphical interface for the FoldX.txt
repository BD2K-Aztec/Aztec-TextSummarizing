ABSTRACT

Summary: A graphical user interface for the FoldX protein design
program has been developed as a plugin for the YASARA molecular
graphics suite. The most prominent FoldX commands such as
free energy difference upon mutagenesis and interaction energy
calculations can now be run entirely via a windowed menu system
and the results are immediately shown on screen.

Availability and Implementation: The plugin is written in Python and
is freely available for download at http://foldxyasara.switchlab.org/
and supported on Linux, MacOSX and MS Windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

The empirical forceﬁeld FoldX (Guerois et al., 2002; Schymkowitz
et al., 2005) was developed for the rapid evaluation of the effect
of mutations on the stability, folding and dynamics of proteins and
nucleic acids (Alibes et al., 2010; Bershtein et al., 2006; Rakoczy
et al., 2011). FoldX is normally run from the command line with
userprovided conﬁguration ﬁles. To increase the usability, many
core functionalities of FoldX have now become available through a
complete graphics interface as a plugin for the YASARA (Krieger
et al., 2002) molecular Viewer.

2 IMPLEMENTATION AND REQUIRED
SOFTWARE

The plu gin is written in Python, is platform—independent and requires
YASARA, FoldX and Python. The free stage of YASARA (View)
can be downloaded at http://www.yasara.org. FoldX is free for
non—commercial purposes from http://foldx.crg.es and Python is by
default installed on MacOSX and Linux machines. MS Windows
users can get Python from http://www.python.org. Installing the
plugin adds a new dropdown ‘FoldX’ menu in the main ‘Analyze’
menu (Fig. l). A selection of FoldX commands is also available
through the YASARA atom— and residue—context menus.

instructions, tutorials and a detailed PDF user manual.

4 THE FOLDX MENU ITEMS

Fix and free residues: FoldX optimizes residue side chain rotamers
during an energy minimization or a mutagenesis task. The ‘Fix’
option allows the user to select residues that, for a speciﬁc reason,
should not be moved during these tasks. The ‘Free’ option unﬁxes
previously ﬁxed residues.

Repair object: a YASARA object is a collection of molecules,
normally a loaded PDB ﬁle. The ‘Repair’ command starts a FoldX
energy minimization (RepairPDB) by optimizing the amino acid
side chains to get a lower free energy of the protein by removing
Vander Waals clashes and bad contacts. The minimized structure is
loaded as a new YASARA object and superposed with the original
structure. Any energy calculation with FoldX requires the structure
to be minimized in advance to obtain reliable results.

Stability of object: the FoldX ‘Stability’ command calculates the
free energy of unfolding (AG). This is the difference in free energy
between the folded and the unfolded states. All energies resulting
from the plugin are expressed in kcal/mol.

Alanine scan of object: ‘Alanine scan’ mutates every residue in
an object to alanine and calculates the energy difference for each

mutation. This allows a rapid evaluation of the inﬂuence of single
residues on the structure stability of large structures. The users
should be aware that this command does not move the neighboring
side chains, and therefore the changes in free energy reﬂect the
maximum overestimation by FoldX. Residues that need further
investigation after an alanine scan should ideally be re—evaluated
with the more computationally intensive ‘Mutate residue’ command
(see below) to obtain the most accurate results.

Interaction energy of molecules: this option executes the FoldX
‘AnalyseComplex’ command to determine the interaction energy
between two selections of molecules. This command also lists the
residues at the interface of the selected molecules in the YASARA
console.

Mutate residue: mutates one residue to one or more new residues,
using the FoldX ‘BuildModel’ command. Five selection menus
are presented: (i) residue selection menu to select the residue
to mutate; (ii) checkbox menu to enable ‘RepairPDB’ prior to
mutagenesis, calculate stability change and interaction energy
change upon mutation; (iii) residue selection menu to choose the
desired replacement residue(s); (iv) options menu to enable or
disable the optimization of neighbouring side chains around the
mutation site, zoom in on mutation site, show new or disrupted
hydrogen bonds and Vander Waals clashes; and (V) options menu
for FoldX speciﬁc settings: number of runs, temperature, pH, ionic
strength and Vander Waals penalty.

Each mutant will load as a new YASARA object superposed on
the original structure. The free energy difference report is printed in
the YASARA console and to a tab—delimited text ﬁle (see below). It
should be noted that FoldX only modiﬁes residue side chains and
not the protein backbone.

Mutate multiple residues: the ‘Mutate multiple residues’ command
allows the user to make double, triple, etc. mutations in a single
structure, including energy calculations. The main differences with
the ‘Mutate residue’ command are the possibility to select multiple
residues in the residue selection menu and a new menu called ‘New
amino acids’ to specify the replacing residues as a contiguous amino
acid sequence in one letter code. This command can be of great
interest to predict the additive effect of multiple mutations as has
been shown previously (Bershtein et al., 2006).

Build homology model: this command acts in the same way as
Mutate multiple residues, except for the user input format. The
latter is designed to specify more than just a few residues, which
is often the case when building a homology model. This command

shows two new menus compared to the ‘Mutate multiple residues’
command: (i) object selection menu to select the model template
structure; and (ii) alignment ﬁle selection menu: the alignment
ﬁle is a plain text ﬁle containing two lines: one representing the
sequence of the template protein and one representing the target
model sequence. The ﬁnal model is loaded as a new YASARA object
and superposed on the template structure.

Save last calculation: the user is presented the choice to save all
ﬁles or just the FOLDXSUMMARYbut ﬁle. This tab—delimited ﬁle
contains free energies, as obtained during the requested calculation,
and can be readily imported in any spreadsheet program. If the user
chooses to save all ﬁles, this will include FoldX conﬁguration ﬁles
that can be re—used to run FoldX from the command line if needed.

5 SUMMARY

Realistic free energy predictions using a graphical front—end have
been shown to be very successful in attracting a large userbase
to solve biological problems (Cooper et al., 2010). The graphical
interface for FoldX eliminates manual writing of conﬁguration ﬁles
and using the command line interpreter. All requirements to use
the plugin are free of charge for non—commercial purposes and it is
expected that the plu gin will attract non—experienced computer users
to perform complex energy calculations with FoldX at the touch of
a button.

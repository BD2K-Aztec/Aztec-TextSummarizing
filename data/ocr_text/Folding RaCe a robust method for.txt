Abstract

Motivation: Protein engineering methods are commonly employed to decipher the folding mech—
anism of proteins and enzymes. However, such experiments are exceedingly time and resource in—
tensive. It would therefore be advantageous to develop a simple computational tool to predict
changes in folding rates upon mutations. Such a method should be able to rapidly provide the se—
quence position and chemical nature to modulate through mutation, to effect a particular change
in rate. This can be of importance in protein folding, function or mechanistic studies.

Results: We have developed a robust knowledge—based methodology to predict the changes in
folding rates upon mutations formulated from amino and acid properties using multiple linear re—
gression approach. We benchmarked this method against an experimental database of 790 point
mutations from 26 two—state proteins. Mutants were first classified according to secondary struc—
ture, accessible surface area and position along the primary sequence. Three prime amino acid fea—
tures eliciting the best relationship with folding rates change were then shortlisted for each class
along with an optimized window length. We obtained a self—consistent mean absolute error of
0.36 s‘1 and a mean Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of 0.81. Jack—knife test resulted in a MAE
of 0.42 s‘1 and a PCC of 0.73. Moreover, our method highlights the importance of outlier(s) detec—
tion and studying their implications in the folding mechanism.

1 Introduction

Understanding protein folding mechanisms involves identifying the
series of steps taken by a polypeptide chain at a high structural and
temporal resolution during the folding process. Though the tem—
poral aspects are challenging to decipher, the sequential and struc—
tural features have been relatively easier to address through protein
engineering methodologies (Fersht et 61]., 1992). This involves the
measurement of both the folding rates and stability for a series of
carefully designed point mutations along the entire protein

sequence. The effects of point mutations on rates and stability are
then compared to the Wild type to obtain a dimensionless number,
the phi—value (Q) that is generally considered as a proxy for the de—
gree of structure at the transition state and hence shedding light on
the mechanism of folding.

Though site—directed mutagenesis experiments have been suc—
cessfully applied to more than 40 different proteins, the downside is
that measuring the stability and folding rates for the series of mu—
tants is exceedingly time and resource—intensive. An alternative to

this approach would involve the computational prediction of
changes in rates and stability upon point mutations. In this regard,
predicting the changes in thermodynamic stability upon point muta—
tions are already well established through sequence—based features
(Huang et al., 2007), structure—based parameters (Dehouck et al.,
2011; Parthiban et al., 2006), force—field based approaches
(Schymkowitz et al., 2005 ; Yin et al., 2007) and statistical—mechan—
ical methods (Naganathan, 2013).

Remarkably, despite the structural complexity of proteins, the
absolute folding rates are nowadays easy to predict either from
topological/structural considerations (Gromiha, 2009; Gromiha and
Selvaraj, 2001; Makarov et al., 2002; Micheletti, 2003; Plaxco
et al., 1998; Zhou and Zhou, 2002), protein length (De Sancho
et al., 2009; Naganathan and Munoz, 2004; Thirumalai, 1995),
protein length combined with the secondary structure content
(Ivankov and Finkelstein, 2004), statistical mechanical approaches
(Henry and Eaton, 2004; Muﬁoz and Eaton, 1999) and simply even
from the primary sequence information combining statistical and
machine-learning approaches (Capriotti and Casadio, 2007; Cheng
et al., 2013; Gromiha et al., 2006; Huang and Gromiha, 2008;
Huang and Gromiha, 2010; Lin et al., 2010; Ouyang and Liang,
2008; Punta and Rost, 2005).

However, the development of models for predicting the effects of
point mutations on changes in folding rates is still at an infant stage.
This is important as the availability of a computational tool could sig—
nificantly reduce the time taken in experimental approaches. More
relevantly, it could serve as a first exploratory step to design muta—
tions of interest that could then be experimentally tested. Moreover, it
might aid in synthetic designing of protein mutants with known effect
on folding rate, for even therapeutic purposes. Till date, Prediction of
protein FOlding RAte change upon point mutation (FORA) is the
only available web server for real value prediction of folding rates
upon point mutations based on a quadratic regression model (Huang
and Gromiha, 2012). The major pitfalls in this approach include the
small training dataset of 467 mutants, moderate performance, encom—
passing both two—state and multistate proteins, less diversity in nature
of mutants as well as amino acid feature dataset.

In this work, we have developed a rigorous, knowledge—based
model for the prediction of folding rates employing a large database
of 790 single—site point mutants specifically from 26 two—state pro—
teins. A triple—order classification scheme together with a multiple
linear regression model incorporating three descriptors was able to
predict the changes in folding rates with a mean Pearson correlation
coefficient (PCC) of 0.73, mean absolute error (MAE) of 0.42 s—1
and prediction accuracy of 81.20% after jack—knife validation. The
structural implications of the outlying mutants have been exclusively
discussed. Web server named ‘Folding RaCe’ has been developed for
prediction purpose.

2 Materials and Methods
2.1 Dataset

We have constructed a set of 790 mutants from two—state proteins
using the data available in Single—Point Mutants Protein Folding
Database (Naganathan and Muﬁoz, 2010) (Supplementary Table
81a). They encompass 26 proteins from all structural classes and se—
quence lengths varying from 37 to 107 amino acid residues. The dis—
tribution of mutants based on experimental Aln kf is shown in
Supplementary Figure 81a. The Aln kf values are in the range of
—5.23 s_1 to 2.60 s_1. Among the 790 mutants, 180 are accelerating
with an average Aln kf of 0.40 s‘1 and the rest are decelerating with
an average Aln kf of —0.90 s_1.

Further, we have used a non—redundant test set of 59 mutants
from FORA (Huang and Gromiha, 2012) (Supplementary Table
Slb). The Aln kf values in the test set varies from —3.73 to 1.13 s—1
and the average values of 9 accelerating and 50 decelerating mutants
are 0.42 and —0.92 s_1, respectively (Supplementary Fig. Slb).

2.2 Amino acid properties

We have utilized a comprehensive collection of 593 diverse amino
acid features that includes physicochemical, conformational,
thermodynamic and evolutionary properties in this study. It
contains 544 descriptors from Amino Acid Index Database
(Kawashima and Kanehisa, 2000) and 49 properties from the lit—
erature (Gromiha, 2005). These properties were normalized be—
tween 0 and 1 to employ a common scale. Further, we have
eliminated the redundant and nonrelevant descriptors, and
reduced them to 103 using the following procedure (Step 1 in Fig.
1): (i) removed 14 properties in which the values are missing for
any of the amino acid residues, (ii) removed 101 properties in
which more than two amino acid residues have the same value,
which have no effect on mutation, (iii) for avoiding redundancy,
we have eliminated 236 properties in such a way that no two prop—
erties have the absolute correlation coefficient of more than 0.85
and (iv) utilized an ensemble of attribute selection methods (six at—
tribute evaluators along with four search methods) available in
Waikato Environment for Knowledge Analysis (WEKA) (Hall
et al., 2009) for reducing the features (Supplementary Table S2).
For each method, we detected the important features using all the
790 mutants as well as the ones selected in more than 50% of the
cross—validated datasets. The selection criteria for each method
have been explained in Witten and Frank (2005). Then, we chose
the features, which are identified to be important in at least two of
the methods. This procedure along with the inclusion of relevant
properties for protein folding such as unfolding entropy
change of hydration, surrounding hydrophobicity etc. by manual
inspection reduced the number of features to 103 (Supplementary

Table S3).

ance along with error bars. SS, Secondary Structure (Strand, Helix, Others);

quence position (N-Terminal, Middle, C-Terminal)

2.3 Computational procedures
The change in folding rate upon point mutations Aln 12f, is calculated
as:

Aln 13,: In laymen: — 1n kyﬂd (1)

where ln lefmutant and In lefwild are natural logarithms of folding rates
for mutant and wild—type amino acid residues, respectively. The
change in folding rates has been related with the change in proper—
ties using correlation coefficient.

2.4 Dataset classification

We observed that none of the shortlisted 103 features exhibited an
absolute PCC greater than 0.36 with Aln [q for the entire set of 790
mutants taken together (Supplementary Fig. S2). Hence, we classi—
fied the mutants based on secondary structure (helix, strand, coil),
normalized Accessible Surface Area (ASA) (buried, ASA< 12%, par—
tially buried, 12<ASA§36% and exposed, ASA>36%) and
sequence position (N—terminal, 333%, Middle, 33—67% and C—
terminal, 267%) of the wild—type residues so that each class con—
tains uniform distribution of data and minimum redundancy (Step 2
in Fig. 1). ASA and secondary structure of mutants were assigned
using Dictionary of Protein Secondary Structure (DSSP) (Kabsch
and Sander, 1983).

2.5 Multiple linear regression and selection of prime
three features
For each class prime three features were selected (Step 3 in Fig. 1),
which elicit the best relationship with the folding rate change using
multiple linear regression technique (Grewal, 1987). The model
with the same features has been subjected to leave—one—out cross—
validation (Jack—Knife test) with n iterations, where n is the total
number of data (trained with n — 1 data and tested the omitted one;
see Section 2.6.2). The method was also tested with 10—fold cross—
validation. Further, the same model has been used for evaluating its
performance on a blind test set. We noticed that some features have
been selected in different models and hence we have used a total of
51 features in all the models.

The contribution of neighboring residues (APseq) has been
included in the method using the equation:

j=i+k

APE, = pm..(z-) _ [( 1.21419,- (a/(zk + 1))I <2)

where la varies from 0 to 9 residues on both directions.

2.6 Model evaluation and validation

2.6.1 Model performance

Two measures viz. PCC and MAE (mean of absolute difference be—
tween experimental and predicted values of the logarithmic change
in folding rates) were employed to evaluate the performance of the
present method for each class. We have also examined the signifi-
cance of prediction using R2 statistic, the F statistic, P value and
mean squared error. In addition, the method was tested with mean
absolute percentage error (MAPE) and symmetric mean absolute
percentage error (sMAPE), which are defined as follows:

|Predicted Aln 12f — Experimental Aln lef|

 

 

APE : 1
M Z | Experimental Aln lef| X 00
(3)
M APE _ Z |Predicted Aln 12f — Experimental Aln lef| 100
s _ Z |Predicted Aln 12f —1— Experimental Aln lef| X
(4)

2.6.2 Model validation
i. Jack—Knife/Leaz/e-One-Out cross validation: Each mutant from

the dataset is left out and the prediction is performed by train-
ing n — 1 dataset for the omitted mutant. Likewise, the proced—
ure is iterated for the entire dataset to obtain the mean measure.

ii. n-fold cross validation: “n” percentage of entire data is elimi—
nated from the training set and is used as a validation set for
testing the model, constituted by the rest of the database. 5—,
10—, 20—, —30 and 40—fold cross validation tests were performed
with 107 iterations each for model validation.

iii. Blind Test: An independent test dataset of change in folding
rates of 59 protein mutants from the FORA dataset.

3 Results and Discussion

3.1 Modeltraining

The first-order classification of mutants based on secondary struc—
ture, ASA and sequential position using three features showed a
mean PCC of 0.42 (Fig. 2). On the other hand, the mean PCC rose
to 0.55 and 0.81, respectively, in second and third—order classifica-
tion (simultaneously considering secondary structure, ASA and se—
quence position together for the relationship with Aln 12f). Similarly,
there was a marked decrease in mean absolute error from 0.73 to
0.36 s‘1 from first to third—order classification. Hence, the predictive
power of the method drastically enhanced upon incorporating third-
order classification.

We have developed specific models pertaining to each of the 27
classes using simple and multiple linear regression approach (max-
imum of up to three descriptors). The enhancement in PCC values
with increase in the number of descriptors is not significant in single
(Supplementary Table S4; Supplementary Fig. 83a) and double—
order classification (Supplementary Table SS; Supplementary Fig.
S3b). However, in the triple—order classification (Supplementary
Table S6; Supplementary Fig. S3c) scheme adopted in the current
study, we observed that there was a drastic improvement in PCC
upon increase in the number of associated features during multiple
linear regression analyses.

3.1.1 Class-wise self-consistency performance of model

We observed that the PCC lies in the range of 0.61—0.98 (mean:
0.81) (Supplementary Fig. 84a) in the considered 27 classes of
third-order model. The MAE ranges from 0.10 to 0.58 s—1

pond to the outliers

(Mean: 0.36 s_1). The MAE for accelerating and decelerating mu-
tants are 0.43 and 0.38 s_1, respectively, which have the average Aln
12f of 0.40 and —0.90 s_1. It is important to note that value of PCC is
largely dependent on the number and variance of the data in a given
dataset. Hence, the class with minimum MAE (0.10 s_1) was identi-
fied as the best performing class (i.e. class index 8 in Supplementary
Fig. 84b and Supplementary Table S7 in which the mutants belong
to ‘Strand’, ‘Exposed’ and ‘Middle’ of the protein sequence).
Accuracy (Gromiha and Huang, 201 1) of our model (i.e. the model’s
performance in discriminating between the accelerating and deceler—
ating mutants), ranges from 60 to 100% (Mean: 83.80%). Hence,
our model depicts a dual performance of prediction as well as dis—
crimination by adopting a single protocol. For improving the preci—
sion of performance, we fine—tuned the prediction using an
optimized sequence window length for each class. We noticed that
the inclusion of window—lengths improved the mean PCC from 0.75
to 0.81. This indicates the variable influence of neighboring residues
in determining the folding rate change of different classes of mutants
and accentuates the variable role of short and long range
interactions.

We have assessed the statistical significance of the present model
and the P value ranges between 10_3 and 10TH. Other parameters
testifying the significance of prediction are presented in
Supplementary Table S8.

3.1.2 Global self-consistency and discriminatory performance

A unified model was developed by combining the prediction results
of all the classes for the entire global dataset of 790 mutations. We
obtained the PCC of 0.81, which is the same as the mean PCC for
class—wise prediction. Further, we have analyzed the performance
using iterative elimination of different sets of data with 107 iter—
ations and obtained the same average PCC of 0.81 (Supplementary
Fig. S5). MAE marginally changed to 0.39 s_1 for the equivalent
model developed for global dataset as compared to the class wise
prediction. This attests to the robustness and flexibility of the cumu—
lative effect of class wise generated models on the entire dataset. The
model is also able to discriminate well between accelerating and
decelerating mutants with 83% accuracy.

3.2 Model validation

3.2.1 Jack-Knife cross validation

We have evaluated the performance of our method using Jack-Knife
test for all the 27 classes. We observed that the PCC is in the range
of 0.50—0.97 (mean: 0.73) (Fig. 3), MAE ranges from 0.14 to
0.68 s_1 (mean: 0.42 s_1) and accuracy ranges from 60 to 97%
(mean: 81.20%) for all 27 classes, which varies slightly from self-
consistent mean PCC of 0.81, mean MAE of 0.36 s_1 and mean ac—
curacy of 83.80%. The MAE for accelerating and decelerating mu-
tants are 0.51 and 0.44 s_1, respectively, which have the average Aln
12f of 0.40 and —0.90 s_1. The minuscule deviation in the perform-
ance before and after Jack—Knife test confirms the robustness of the
model as seen in Figure 4a and b, respectively.

3.2.2 n-fold cross validation

Models developed from the global dataset have been examined with
10, 20, 30 and 40—fold cross validation with 107 iterations. We ob—
tained a mean PCC of 0.71, which is similar to that obtained in the
Jack-Knife test.

3.2.3 Blind set test

The robustness of this model is also evident from the fact that it pre—
dicts the changes in folding rates from the FORA dataset (Huang
and Gromiha, 2012) comprising of 59 mutants, with a MAE of
0.78 s_1. We noticed that three of them are outliers and their re-
moval reduced the MAE to 0.62 s_1. The higher MAE compared
with cross—validation dataset may be attributed with the nature of
the proteins in the FORA dataset including oc—lactalbumin that has
four disulphide bonds in its native structure and tenascin, which is a
fibrous protein with a curved Chevron plot. Removal of mutants in
these proteins showed a MAE of 0.46 s_1. The comparison with
FORA showed a better performance of our method with respect of
PCC and MAE despite of the fact that these mutants were a part of
training set of FORA (Supplementary Table S9a).

3.2.4 Comparison of the method with FORA

FORA showed a mean PCC of 0.53, MAE of 0.50 s_1 and accuracy
of 81.54% after cross—validation in a set of 467 mutants
(Supplementary Table S9b). However, it did not perform equally
well in a blind assessment carried out on a non—redundant dataset of
568 mutants (PCC: 0.20, MAE: 0.75 s‘1 and accuracy: 75.22%)
(Supplementary Table S9c). It clearly shows that the performance of
the present method is better than the only available other method,
FORA.

3.2.5 Prediction performance in different proteins

We have evaluated the performance of the present method in all
the 26 proteins and the results are presented in Supplementary
Table 810. We observed that the MAE is in the range of 0.27 to
0.76 s_1. This result reveals that the present method is not depend—
ing on a specific protein instead it can be applied to all the two—state
proteins.

3.3 Feature set description

3.3.1 Sequence-based amino acid feature set

We found that the changes in folding rates upon point mutations are
primarily affected by the following order of amino acid features: hydro—
phobicity >> secondary structure propensity % physicochemical >
thermodynamic > conformational >> evolutionary, emphasizing the
dominant inﬂuence of hydrophobic effect during the folding process.
The list of properties, which are identified as important in multiple re-
gression equations are highlighted in italics in Supplementary Table S3.
Further, the properties, which have the single correlation of more
than 0.6 with experimental change in folding rates within a class,
are highlighted in bold. These include unfolding hydration heat capacity
change (Oobatake and Ooi, 1993), equilibrium constant with reference
to the ionization property of COOH group (Zimmerman et al., 1968),
residue volume (Bigelow, 1967), SWEIG index (Cornette et al., 1987),
normalized frequency of coil (Nagano, 1973), unfolding entropy
change of chain (Oobatake and Ooi, 1993) and long range nonbonded
energy per atom (Oobatake and Ooi, 1977), which belong to physical,
chemical, energetic and conformational categories, and highlights
the necessity of combining properties for predicting the changes in
folding rates.

3.3.2 Structure-based amino acid feature set

The structures of all the 790 point mutants were modeled employing
homology modeling with the aid of MODELLER v9.7 (Sali and
Blundell, 1993), fold recognition with Phyre2 (Kelley and Sternberg,
2009) and ab initio with I—Tasser (Zhang, 2008) protocols.
However, the mutant structure were minimally different from the

wild type (all atom RMSD < 1 A). All relevant structural descriptors
such as contact order, long range order, number of hydrogen bonds,
total contact index, multiple contact index and surrounding hydro-
phobicity for different spatial and sequence separations, exhibited
only minor variations between wild type and mutant structures.
None of the combinations of structural features exhibited PCC
greater than 0.63 in any classification.

3.4 Interpretation of outliers

We find that the classes with a correlation coefficient below 0.75
were profoundly affected by some outlying data points. We opted
for Tukey’s box plot approach (McGill et al., 1978) to identify out—
liers as it is less sensitive to extremities of the data. In order to de—
cipher the biological relevance of such mutants, we performed
rigorous analysis of outliers at two levels: (i) global dataset and (ii)
protein wise.

3.4.1 Outliers in the global dataset

Twelve of the 27 classes were found to be affected by the outliers in
class wise analysis (Supplementary Fig. S6). In class index 7, we ob—
serve that PCC is highly affected by the outliers despite exhibiting
only minimal changes in the mean absolute deviation. This is an—
other reason for giving preeminence to MAE than PCC in analyzing
the model’s relative performance. Similar analysis, performed on
global dataset led to the detection of 20 statistically significant out—
liers out of total 27. MAE between their experimental and predicted
change in folding rates after Jack—Knife test was greater than
1.39 s_1. The PCC markedly improved to 0.83 from 0.73 and MAE
dropped to 0.35 from 0.42 s_1 after removal of all the outliers (and
after Jack-Knife test) confirming the authenticity of detected out—
liers. The MAPE value is 194.23 and 166.05% as well as sMAPE
value is 31.16 and 24.87%, respectively, with and without outliers.
In the test set, the MAPE value is 205.89 and 201.65% as well as
sMAPE value is 49.08 and 40.78%, respectively with and without
outliers. The high MAPE is attributed with the low value of Aln 12f in
which a small deviation would cause a high MAPE (Equation 3).
The outlying mutants belonged to three categories: (i) aromatic to
aliphatic mutations (e.g. Phe to Val), i.e. truncation of the aromatic
ring, creating a void and severely affecting local packing, (ii) muta—
tions involving glycine (e.g. Gly to Arg): significantly affecting the
backbone flexibility, (iii) large side chain truncations in aliphatic
residues (e.g. Ile to Ser) (Supplementary Table 811).

3.4.2 Protein-wise identification of outliers

For all of the 26 single domain proteins, the outlying mutations
identified using an absolute deviation cut—off of 1.39s_1 were
scrutinized at the tertiary structure level to gain a physical insight
into the origins of this behavior (Supplementary Table 812;
Supplementary Fig. S7). We observed that the structural and en—
ergetic factors are dominant for accounting the folding rates of
these mutants.

In colicin E9 immunity protein Im9, the mutant F15A is identi-
fied as a potential outlier (Fig. 5a). The exclusion of this mutant
drastically increased the PCC from 0.78 to 0.87 and decreased MAE
from 0.47 to 0.35 s_1.

One of the striking observations with such aromatic outliers was
their role as a mediator in forming an aromatic core triad or dyad in
their respective proteins. For example in Im9 protein, a phenylalan-
ine triad is observed in the protein core comprising of three phenyl-
alanine residues (F15, F40 and F83) from three different regions,
N-terminal, middle and C—terminal, respectively (Fig. 5b);

Fig. 5. (a) Influence of F15A as an outlier in Im9 (b) Core aromatic triad
comprising of N-terminal F15 acting as a bridge between the middle F40 and
C-terminal F83 (PDB Id: 1|MO)

the experimental mutation position F15 (outlier), seems to act as a
bridge between the F40 and F83, thereby bringing the distant re—
gions of the sequence close in space and hence packing the structure.
Other aromatic outliers were also found to form such triads in acyl
coenzyme A binding protein (PDB ID: 2ABD), fyn tyrosine kinase
SH3 (PDB ID: lSHF) and acylphosphatase (PDB ID: 1APS) and
an aromatic dyad in protein L (PDB ID: 1HZ6) (Supplementary
Table 812). These observations suggest the prediction of rates upon
mutations involving these regions is complicated by the presence of
multiple structural and energetic factors that is challenging to be
taken into account by the simple model developed in this work.

3.5 Limitations of this model

Though we have presented a simple procedure to predict the changes
in rates upon mutations, it still has some deficiencies due to the know—
ledge—based approach. First, the training dataset mainly comprises of
only specific types of mutations and hence the prediction will be less
accurate upon some uncommon mutations. Second, only 22% of the
total dataset comprise of accelerating mutants due to which the model
is intrinsically less sensitive to such effects. Finally, the detailed nature
of the model led to an increase in the number of parameters, as both
events are mutually exclusive. Hence, in order to increase the predic—
tion accuracy despite of various constraints imposed by the experi—
mental dataset, we had to compromise with the parameter count.

3.6 Web server development

A web server named ‘Folding RaCe’ has been developed for the pre—
diction of change in folding rates upon point mutations. The user is
required to provide the PDB ID or protein structure file in PDB for-
mat, chain ID, the position and the mutation to be introduced (e.g.
F15A). The output includes the change in folding rate upon the mu—
tation along with the details of secondary structure, ASA and
sequential position of the mutant. It is freely available at http://
www.iitm.ac.in/bioinfo/proteinfolding/foldingrace.html.

3.7 Conclusion

We present a multiple linear regression approach to predict the
changes in folding rates upon point mutations in two—state proteins.
It involves a combination of rigorous classification of mutations
incorporating both structural (secondary structure and ASA) and se—
quence—based aspects of proteins, and heuristic and knowledge
based feature selection of amino acid descriptors. The model could
predict with a correlation coefficient of 0.73, an absolute error of
0.42s_1 and an accuracy of 81.2% with the experimental changes
in rates after cross validation and outperforms the only available
method FORA. The symmetric mean absolute percentage error rates

(sMAPE) for the cross—validation and test datasets is 31.16 and
49.08%, respectively. We have developed a web server named
‘Folding RaCe’ that incorporates the features discussed. The struc—
tural implications of outliers have also been discussed. We expect
this method and server to be of importance to experimentalists in
identifying the position and nature of mutations that change the
rates to the desired extent that can have both folding—mechanistic
and functional implications.

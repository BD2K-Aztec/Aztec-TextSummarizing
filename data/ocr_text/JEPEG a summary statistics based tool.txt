Abstract

Motivation: Gene expression is influenced by variants commonly known as expression quantitative
trait loci (eOTL). On the basis of this fact, researchers proposed to use eOTL/functional information
univariately for prioritizing single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) signals from genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS). However, most genes are influenced by multiple eOTLs which, thus, jointly
affect any downstream phenotype. Therefore, when compared with the univariate prioritization ap-
proach, a joint modeling of eOTL action on phenotypes has the potential to substantially increase sig-
nal detection power. Nonetheless, a joint eOTL analysis is impeded by (i) not measuring all eOTLs in
a gene and/or (ii) lack of access to individual genotypes.

Results: We propose joint effect on phenotype of eOTL/functional SNPs associated with a gene
(JEPEG), a novel software tool which uses only GWAS summary statistics to (i) impute the sum-
mary statistics at unmeasured eOTLs and (ii) test for the joint effect of all measured and imputed
eOTLs in a gene. We illustrate the behavior/performance of the developed tool by analysing the
GWAS meta-analysis summary statistics from the Psychiatric Genomics Consortium Stage 1 and
the Genetic Consortium for Anorexia Nervosa.

Conclusions: Applied analyses results suggest that JEPEG complements commonly used univari-
ate GWAS tools by: (i) increasing signal detection power via uncovering (a) novel genes or
(b) known associated genes in smaller cohorts and (ii) assisting in fine-mapping of challenging
regions, e.g. major histocompatibility complex for schizophrenia.

1 Introduction

Univariate analysis of genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
has emerged as the main tool for identifying trait/disease-associated
genetic variants (Burton etal., 2007). However, against initial
expectations, most variants reported by complex trait GWAS are

common single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) with weak or
moderate effect sizes, which account for only a small fraction of the
overall phenotypic variation (Manolio et al., 2009). Presumably,
most common causal variants are not detected in GWAS due to their
small effect sizes (Yang et al., 2010). Therefore, to identify a greater

number of causal variants, GWAS of (significantly) larger sample
sizes is needed. However, such dramatic increase in sample size
might be both time consuming and cost prohibitive.

One reasonable approach to increase the power to detect true as-
sociation signals with small effect sizes is to use prior biological
knowledge. For instance, researchers can prioritize the genetic vari-
ants by utilizing evidence/information of their impact on biological
processes giving rise to the desired phenotypes. One such biological
process is the regulation of gene expression, which is believed to
have influenced human evolution and play an important role in dis-
eases (Emilsson et al., 2008; Kudaravalli et al., 2009). Expression of
most genes is influenced by expression quantitative trait loci
(eQTLs), which were hypothesized to be prime candidates for causal
variants affecting various phenotypes (Gaffney etal., 2012; Gilad
et al., 2008). This hypothesis was subsequently empirically sup-
ported by the detection of significant eQTL enrichment among
GWAS association signals (Nica etal., 2010; Nicolae etal., 2010).
Recent studies making use of eQTL/functional information
showed a boost in the detection rate of GWAS signals (Fehrmann
etal., 2011; Nicolae etal., 2010; Schork etal., 2013). These func-
tional approaches can take advantage of a diverse collection of data-
bases/tools of functional annotations, which have become publicly
available (ENCODE Project Consortium etal., 2012; Wang etal.,
2010). For instance, the Encyclopedia of DNA Elements (ENCODE)
Consortium has already catalogd huge amount of information on
functional elements including gene expression, transcripts, transcrip-
tion factor binding sites, chromatin, DNA methylation and histone
modification patterns (ENCODE Project Consortium et al., 2012).

As mentioned earlier, to increase causal variant detection, signal
enrichment in functional variants was used to justify prioritization/fil-
tering procedures based on functional annotation (Schork etal.,
2013). Recently, an improvement of this method was proposed. It first
identifies functional annotations associated with phenotypes of inter-
est and then uses them to prioritize SNPs (Pickrell, 2014). However,
while useful, such an approach has the disadvantage of considering
only the univariate effect of eQTI/functional SNPs. To leverage infor-
mation from multiple SNPs, multi-SNP based association tests (Ehret
etal., 2012; Wood etal., 2011; Yang etal., 2012) have been also pro-
posed. Compared with univariate approaches, these methods certainly
offer better detection power, but typically test all SNPs, not only the
functional ones. Nonetheless, under the reasonable assumption that
the causal pathways are mostly composed of functional SNPs, such
approaches are likely to incur a power loss. Even more, under the
same assumption, these approaches might diffuse [via linkage disequi-
librium (LD)] the signals to relatively distant non-functional regions,
which might add another layer of difficulty to any subsequent attempt
to fine-map association signals.

Given the joint impact of eQTLs on gene expression, it is of great
interest to multivariater analyse eQTL/functional SNPs in a gene.
Nevertheless, for such a test, researchers need to impute a large frac-
tion of these variants. Unfortunately, the commonly used genotype
imputation methods need access to genetic data, which, unlike sum-
mary statistics, are not always available. Summary statistics-based im-
putation methods offer fast imputation with great accuracy (Lee etal.,
2013; Pasaniuc etal., 2014; Pickrell, 2014). However, by default they
impute all SNPs, not only the much less numerous eQTL SNPs. The
unnecessary imputation of mostly unused SNPs makes these methods
much more computer intensive than it is really necessary.

To improve over the state of the art, we propose joint effect on
phenotype of eQTI/functional SNPs associated with a gene (JEPEG).
JEPEG is an integrated method/software tool which uses only GWAS

statistics of unmeasured eQTL/functional SNPs and (ii) jointly test the
effect of these (measured and imputed) functional SNPs associated
with each gene in the genome. The associated software consists of
four major components (Fig. 1): (i) an extensive database of eQTU
functional SNPs (Section 2.1 ), (ii) a module for directly imputing sum-
mary statistics of unmeasured eQTL/functional SNPs [i.e. Direct
Imputation of summary STatistics (DIST) (Lee etal., 2013)] (Section
2.2), (iii) a module for testing the joint effect of all reliably measured!
imputed functional SNPs associated with a gene (i.e. JEPEG) (Section
2.3) and (iv) reference population panels available/needed for both
imputation and joint testing (Section 2.4).

2 Methods

2.1 SNP annotation database

To facilitate the pooling of SNPs effects within the same functional
category (Section 2.3), the initial version of the database focuses on
autosomal SNPs for which we can predict the direction and magni-
tude of allelic effects on gene expression. Because our applied ana-
lyses focus mainly on neuropsychiatric disease, the current version
of the database is limited to SNPs affecting expression levels for
brain-expressed genes. However, given that most genes are brain ex-
pressed, the use of this database for the analysis of non-psychiatric
phenotypes might provide a tolerable first iteration in the absence of
an eQTL database for the relevant tissue(s). The current SNP anno-
tation database contains functional annotations for SNPs from the
publicly available 1000 Genomes (1KG) (Altshuler et al., 2010)
reference panel, Phase I version 3, which were subsequently screened
in silico for an impact on the expression/function of brain-expressed
genes. (The exception being the empirically derived cis- and trans-
eQTL came from studies using smaller GWAS SNP panels.) The
functional annotations include reference SNP cluster identifier (ID)
(rsid), SNP location (chromosome and position), reference/alterna-
tive allele, associated gene ID, functional category, weight score, etc.
Whenever available, we use human genome organization (HUGO)
name for the gene having its expression/function affected by the
eQTL/SNP entry. Conceptually, within each functional category,
the weight score is a proxy measure for the predicted amount of in-
crease in the expression of a gene brought on by the reference allele
of its functional SNP. (Weight is negative when the reference allele is
predicted to decrease gene expression.) Due to their diverse mode of
acting on gene expressions, different functional categories might
have different such proxy measures, e.g. free energy for the micro
RNAs and deleteriousness score for protein function variants
(Section 1 in Supplementary Data for more details). In the

gene-based statistical analysis, the proxy measures act as weight
scores that are used to combine, within each gene, the univariate
summary statistics of measured and imputed SNPs within functional
categories. Subsequently, these functional category statistics are
combined in an overall gene level statistic.

In its current version, JEPEG uses SNPs belonging to six func-
tional categories: (i) SNPs directly affecting protein function/struc-
ture encoded by a gene, i.e. protein function/structure (PFS) (e.g.
stop codons), (ii) SNPs affecting expression of a gene by disrupting
its transcription factor binding sites (TFBS), (iii) SNPs affecting the
gene function by interrupting biogenesis of an miRNA (miRNA
Structure), (iv) SNPs affecting miRNA—mRNA target interaction
(miRNA Target) and non-categorized/empirically derived (v) cis-
and (vi) trans-eQTLs. While PFS variants are not technically eQTLs,
given the similarities between the two functional categories, we
henceforth extend the definition of eQTLs to include PFS variants.

2.2 Direct imputation of summary statistics at
unmeasured eQTLs

The SNP annotation database includes many functionally annotated
SNPs that are not available in GWAS panels. Thus, before testing
the multivariate effect of all functionally annotated SNPs affecting a
gene, JEPEG imputes normally distributed statistics (two tailed
Z—scores, henceforth called summary statistics) of the unmeasured
functional SNPs. The imputation is achieved by employing DIST,
one of our recently developed method/software which directly im-
putes summary statistics of unmeasured SNPs (Lee et al., 2013), i.e.
without the need of a prior genotype imputation. When compared
with the commonly used genotype imputation methods, e.g.
IMPUTE2 (Howie etal., 2009), DIST was found to be of compar-
able accuracy and two orders of magnitude more efficient in terms
of both running time and memory usage. Within JEPEG software,
DIST module is silently run to impute summary statistics for un-
measured functional SNPs. Due to imputing only the less numerous
set of unmeasured functional SNPs, the imputation module is much
faster than the stand-alone DIST software. The high-quality imput-
ation is achieved by applying the classical conditional expectation
formula for multivariate normal variates using only (i) association
summary statistics of reported markers within sliding windows with
a fixed length and (ii) correlation matrix of homologous genotypes
estimated from an external reference panel (e.g. 1KG).

In more detail, let Z“ be the vector of Z-scores of unmeasured
functional variants in the non-overlapping prediction window with
a fixed length [0.1 mega base pairs (Mb) by default]. Denote as Zm
the vector of Z-scores of all measured variants (including non-anno-
tated measured variants) within the extended window (i.e. the pre-
diction window with two fixed-length ﬂanking regions (0.2 Mb by
default)). Let 2%," be the correlation matrix between the unmeas-
ured and measured variants and  be the correlation matrix
among the measured variants, which are both estimated from a ref-
erence panel. By using the classical conditional mean formula (Lee
etal., 2013), Z“ can be imputed as

1

z, = Em  zm.

The variance—covariance matrix (proxy imputation information
measure) of Z“ can be subsequently estimated as

I“ = :.,.(Z.,.)‘1Z..T-

To obtain imputation Z-scores with a variance of one, we normalize
Z“ using the square root of I“ (Pasaniuc et al., 2014).

Due to the strongly correlated structure of the genotype data, the
correlation matrix can be ill-conditioned and, therefore, result in a
large standard error for the imputed Z-scores. The high variability
of estimates can lead to poor accuracy and false positives. To cir-
cumvent the degradation of DIST performance, similar to Pasaniuc
et al. (2014) and Pickrell (2014), we add a ridge adjustment (with a
heuristical default value 2 = 2 / ﬂ, where n is the sample size of the
reference panel) to the diagonal elements of the estimated correl-
ation matrix. To avoid the detrimental effects of SNPs of low imput-
ation accuracy, for the joint testing we retain only eQTL SNPs
having the imputation information above a user-selectable threshold
(0.3 by default).

2.3 Testing for the joint effect of eQTL/functional SNPs
To test for the joint effect of eQTL/functional SNPs known to affect
the expression of a gene, JEPEG was designed to rely solely on the
(univariate) measured and imputed summary statistics. Based on the
database-derived functional category information, JEPEG first
groups eQTL/functional SNPs affecting the same gene into the
aforementioned six categories: (i) PFS, (ii) TFBS, (iii) miRNA
Structure, (iv) miRNA Target, (v) uncategorized cis-eQTLs and (vi)
uncategorized trans-eQTLs. These functional SNPs can belong to
one or more categories/genes simultaneously. A simple method for
estimating the joint effect of all eQTLs associated with a gene might
be to combine all eQTL association statistics regardless of their
functional category. However, such an approach may result in a
saturated statistical model with a large number of degrees of free-
dom (df), i.e. the number of all eQTLs associated with a gene. When
the pairwise LD is elevated, it leads to statistical power loss (Bacanu
etal., 2008; Chapman etal., 2003). To avoid a large number of df
for the resulting test statistic (while simultaneously assessing the
contribution of each functional category to the overall signal), we
pool together statistics of all SNPs from the same functional cat-
egory in a single synthetic category score. This score is a weighted
sum of the Z-scores associated with the SNPs in the functional cat-
egory. The weighted sums of all functional categories influencing a
gene are subsequently combined in a gene-level statistic by using a
Mahalanobis-type statistic, which takes into account their multivari-
ate correlation (as estimated from a relevant reference panel).

In more detail, let Z be the vector of Z-scores for m SNPs func-
tionally associated with the gene under investigation, Y be the diag-
onal matrix of the square root of imputation information for the m
functional SNPs, S be the weight matrix, as derived from the SNP
annotation database, for the m functional SNPs belonging to the k
functional categories. S consists of m column vectors representing
weight scores of the k functional categories per SNP, which are
precalculated on the basis of the consensus of results from diverse
prediction methods (Section 1 in Supplementary Data) and stored in
the JEPEG annotation database. To downweight SNPs with low
imputation information, based on Y and S, we compute the adjusted
weight matrix by accounting for the imputation information of the
SNPs: W: SY. Let ZG be the correlation matrix of SNP genotypes,
e.g. as estimated from a reference panel, U be the vector of weighted
sum of Z-scores by category (i.e. the synthetic scores) and EU be
the variance—covariance/correlation matrix of U. Then, in mathem-
atical notation:

U = WZ and EU: WZZWT,

where ZZ is the covariance/correlation matrix of Z. Given that,
under the null hypothesis of no association between genotype and
trait (H0), Z is asymptotically distributed as a multivariate normal

with a zero mean vector and covariance matrix 20, it follows that:

EU 2 WZGWT'

Due to LD, ZG might be close to singular, which results in unstable
estimation of the gene-based test statistic. Thus, to stabilize JEPEG
statistic, we add the DIST ridge adjustment to the diagonal elements
of 20. Based on the synthetic scores of all functional categories af-
fecting the gene and their correlation structure, JEPEG computes an
omnibus gene-level test as

T = UTZU_1 U,

which, under H0, is asymptotically distributed as a central x2 statis-
tic with k df. The two-tailed P-values associated with the normalized
U can be used as a post hoc measure to evaluate the contribution of
each functional category to the omnibus gene signal.

Adjustment for the background enrichment of GWAS signals

Large GWAS/meta-analyses [such as Psychiatric Genomics
Consortium (PGC)] harbor abundant small or moderate association
signals not reaching significance thresholds across the entire gen-
ome. Thus, even when a gene is not related to the trait, due to the
background enrichment of the entire genome, we have elevated
chances to detect a signal in such a gene. Intuitively, background en-
richment makes the sum of squares of the univariate statistics to be-
have like a non-central X2 variable. Consequently, for large studies,
it is more desirable (and conservative) to assess the statistical signifi-
cance/P-value of T after adjusting for background enrichment. In
more detail, let N be the total number of tested genes and T,- and k,-
be the JEPEG test statistic and df of the ith gene, respectively. The
enrichment adjusted P-value of the ith gene is then obtained under
the assumption that T,- follows a non-central x2 distribution

with k,- df and a non-centrality parameter per df
,1 = mag; (Til; k1) /N, 0) (Bacanu etal., 2014).

 

2.4 Reference population

In the current version, we have the capability of using as reference
populations 1KG Europeans (112379), Asians (112286), Africans
(112246) and Americans (112181). These panels were obtained
from 1KG Phase I release version 3 database, by including only bial-
lelic SNPs, indels and structural variants with two or more allelles.
These reference panels are available for both imputation (DIST) and
gene-level testing (JEPEG) modules. Future iterations of the software
will be able to (i) use larger reference panels and (ii) be applied to
cosmopolitan cohorts.

2.5 Assessment of Type I error rate of JEPEG

To estimate the Type I error rates of JEPEG, we simulated (under
H0) 100 realistic Illumina 1 M (http://www.illumina.com) GWAS
summary datasets for both continuous and binary phenotypes. For
each simulation, the genotypic data were obtained by randomly
drawing with replacement 10 000 subjects from UK10K dataset
(http://www.uk10k.org) and retaining as GWAS (measured) SNPs
only those found on Illumina 1 M chip. The continuous phenotype
was simulated as random standard normal variables, and the binary
phenotype was obtained by randomly assigning case status to 5000
subjects and control status to the remaining subjects. The summary
statistics were obtained by testing for association between SNP and
phenotype using linear/logistic regression. We applied JEPEG to the
100 simulated H0 summary dataset from each phenotype type and

estimated the empirical Type I error rates. To evaluate the robust-
ness of the proposed method when the LD matrix of the study co-
hort and reference population is not perfectly matched, we used the
more ethnically diverse 1KG Europeans as a reference population to
analyse the UK10K-derived data.

2.6 Assessment of JEPEG performance

To evaluate the performance of the proposed method, we compared it
to the commonly used univariate GWAS methods and, at default set-
tings, with VErsatile Gene-based Association Study (VEGAS), a
broadly used gene-based test for association (http://gump.qimr.edu.au/
VEGAS/) (Liu etal., 2010). VEGAS uses as a test statistic the sum of
univariate X2 of SNPs within a gene and assesses its statistical signifi-
cance using an empirical H0 distribution simulated from a multivariate
normal distribution with LD matrix of the SNPs as a covariance ma-
trix. We applied the earlier methods to four real summary datasets: (i)
PGC1 bipolar disorder (BD) (Sklar etal., 2011), (ii) schizophrenia
(SCZ) (Ripke etal., 2011), (iii) major depressive disorder (MDD)
(Sullivan etal., 2013) cohorts and (iv) anorexia nervosa cohort from
Genetic Consortium For Anorexia Nervosa (GCAN) (Boraska etal.,
2014). Before the applied analyses, we converted all four summary
datasets to National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI)
build 37 (hg19) using liftOver (Hinrichs etal., 2006). 1KG Europeans
data was used as the reference panel for JEPEG.

To limit the increase in Type I error rates of JEPEG due to
certain genes being non-causal but very close to GWAS peaks, we
adjusted all JEPEG gene level statistics for background enrichment.
Enrichment-adjusted JEPEG gene-level P values were subsequently
adjusted for multiple testing by using the false discovery rate
(FDR) procedure. Genes with FDR-adjusted JEPEG P-value
(q-value) < 0.05 were deemed significant. We also deemed as sug-
gestive genes having non-significant q-values below 0.16, i.e. the
P-value threshold corresponding to Akaike Information Criterion.
Due to the difficulty of assigning df to their statistics, VEGAS gene
statistics were not adjusted for background enrichment but they
were adjusted for multiple testing using FDR.

3 Results

While H0 summary datasets were simulated based on the fairly
homogenous samples from UK10K and analysed using the multi-
ethnic 1KG Europeans reference panel, JEPEG still controls the
Type I error rates at or below the nominal level (Fig. 2). The results
suggest that JEPEG with the ridge correction is reasonably robust to
(non-African) intracontinental LD variations.

In PGC1 BD cohort, out of 13 552 genes with reliable functional
information, we detected 10 significant and 4 suggestive signals
(Table 1). The most significant gene (q-value = 3 X 104) was
RASGEFIA (10q11.21), which was never reported to be associated
with BD. For this gene, JEPEG database contained functional anno-
tation information for only six trans-eQTL SNPs on chromosome 6,
with the most significant residing near SYNE1, a gene already de-
tected univariately in PGC1 BD meta-analysis (Sklar etal., 2011).
The second most significant gene was the SYNE1 gene
(q-value = 8 X 10‘4) itself, for which the statistic was obtained based
on 38 nearby eQTL SNPs. Five of the significant genes belong to
ITIH cluster on chromosome 3, which also encompasses two other
suggestive genes. It is notable that I TIH cluster did not yield any sig-
nificant SNP signal in PGC1 BD (or SCZ) but was detected univari-
ately only in the (much larger) combined analysis of PGC1 BD and
SCZ (Sklar etal., 2011). For the same cohort, VEGAS detected 27

significant and 8 suggestive gene signals out of 17 789 genes
(Supplementary Table S1). Significant signals were obtained from
six gene regions, where, except the marginally significant chr2
LMANZL and chr19 NFIX (albeit VEGAS standard errors are
orders of magnitude larger than the small estimated P-values), also
detected by JEPEG. VEGAS did not detect RASGEFIA. We note
that while most regions were detected by both multivariate methods,
JEPEG appears to fine-map these regions by returning smaller gene
lists.

For the SCZ cohort, out of 13 420 genes with functional infor-
mation, 18 and 13 genes harbored significant and suggestive signals,
respectively (Table 2). However, only six significant genes were out-
side the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region (chr6:
28—33.5 Mb), which has been associated with SCZ in many
Caucasian GWAS (Purcell etal., 2009; Stefansson etal., 2009).

Table 1. JEPEG results for PGC1 BD

We underscore the detection of a significant signal for MAD1L1
(q-value=0.01). This gene was not identified in univariately in
PGC1 SCZ, but was detected in a larger PGC1 follow-up study,
which included additional Swedish cohorts (Ripke etal., 2013).
We also detected 3 significant and 3 suggestive gene signals from
ITIH cluster. We also note the strong significant SCZ signals in
NKAPL and ZKSCAN4, which were the only MHC genes harbor-
ing significant signals in a Han Chinese SCZ GWAS (Yue etal.,
2011). Meanwhile, for the same data, VEGAS detected only 3 sig-
nificant (AB CC1 2, SRCAP and ZNF629) and 2 suggestive (PHKGZ
and ZNF681) gene signals out of 17 704 genes (Supplementary
Table 52). We mention that none of the genes with significant
VEGAS signal are located within LD independent SCZ association
regions from the latest PGC SCZ Stage 2 study (Ripke et al., 2014).

For PGC1 MDD and GCAN studies, neither multivariate
method yields any significant findings. While disappointing, our
findings closely mirror the univariate results. An increase in sample
size for the two disorders might help increase signal detection power
for all methods.

On a computation node with 4x Intel Xeon 6 core 2.67-GHz pro-
cessor and 64 GB of RAM, the single core JEPEG analyses for any of
the four summary datasets required slightly under 2 h of running time
and less than 8 GB of peak memory usage. The web-based VEGAS
(http://gump.qimr.edu.au/VEGAS/) at default
required around 1 day of computation time for each summary dataset.

4 Conclusions

In this article, we propose JEPEG, a new software/method for test-
ing the joint effects on trait for SNPs functionally associated with a
gene. The proposed method (i) imputes unmeasured functional
SNPs, (ii) pools in a synthetic variable the information of all (meas-
ured and imputed) SNPs in the same functional category, (iii) to ob-
tain an omnibus gene statistic, combines these synthetic variables in
a Mahalanobis-type test and (iv) provides single functional category

statistics, which can be used to identify the categories driving the
overall omnibus signal. We use realistic simulated datasets, to show
that JEPEG controls the Type I error rates at or below nominal
rates. The application of the method to PGC1 BD and SCZ datasets
suggests that JEPEG has the potential to improve both gene detec-
tion and fine mapping of challenging regions, such as MHC for SCZ
and I TIH cluster for BD (SCZ).

The argument that the joint eQTL testing might substantially in-
crease detection power is strongly supported by three key findings
from the applied analyses. First, we identified at least one novel can-
didate gene for BD, RASGEFIA, based on its trans-eQTL SNPs.
Due to trans-eQTLs being generally considered less reliable, the evi-
dence for this gene should be viewed with caution. However, we
note that RASGEFIA is already known to be implicated in a periph-
eral neural disorders (Hirschprung’s disease) (Fernandez et al.,
2012). Second, we detected both significant BD and SCZ signals in
ITIH cluster, which was univariately uncovered only in a much
larger combined analysis of PGC1 BD and SCZ cohorts (Sklar et al.,
2011). Third, in PGC1 we detected a significant SCZ signal for
MAD1L1, which was not identified by VEGAS and was univariately
detected only in a larger superset of PGC1 (Ripke et al., 2013).

The practical applications suggest that JEPEG has the potential
to aid fine-mapping of challenging regions. For instance, some of the
largest MHC signals for SCZ were in NKAPL and ZKSCAN4,
which were the only MHC genes with significant signals in a Han
Chinese SCZ cohort (Yue etal., 2011). Even more, while VEGAS

detected 12 BD signals in ITIH cluster, the strength of JEPEG BD
signals suggests that the five JEPEG genes in ITIH cluster are more
likely to be functionally involved in BD etiology. The three JEPEG
SCZ signals in the ITIH cluster support the hypothesis of a pleio-
tropic effect on both disorders. If we are further willing to assume
that the same ITIH genes might predispose to both disorders, the
intersection of SCZ and BD signals might be used to further narrow
the list of candidate genes to just GLT8D1 and M USTN 1.

Given its novel multivariate testing of functional SNPs, JEPEG is
a complementary tool to the commonly used univariate GWAS ap-
proach and agnostic multivariate approaches like VEGAS. Our ap-
proach will augment the performance of these methods for certain
biologically plausible causal models that are less suitable to univari-
ate/agnostic detection, e.g. genes with multiple functional SNPs
jointly acting on a trait. Due to basing its inference solely on sum-
mary statistics, the proposed method can be used even when subject-
level genotype data is not available. Even more, because the LD
structure used by JEPEG is unaffected by the relatedness between
samples, it can be used in its current form to analyse summary data
coming from large family studies.

We plan to further develop and update JEPEG along three main
directions. First, we plan to upgrade the SNP annotation database
by extending the number of SNPs and their functional annotations.
For instance, we plan to add to the database variants specific to (i)
1KG non-Caucasian cohorts, (ii) UK10K (http://www.uk10k.org)
and (iii) X-linked eQTL SNPs. We will also continuously update the

functional categorization and SNP weights based on the latest avail-
able detection tools and practical evidence from larger empirical
studies. Second, based on the available scientific evidence, we will
add functional SNPs from other potentially relevant tissues/cell
types (e.g. lymphocytes and monocytes). Third, we plan to add add-
itional functional categories. The current version relies heavily on
functional categories for which we are able to predict the direction
and magnitude of the effect of SNP’s reference allele on gene expres-
sion. This feature was convenient because it allowed for pooling of
Z—scores within each functional category in a one df statistic.
However, while expedient, this is not a requirement for our method.
When the direction of the allelic effect on gene expression is hard to
predict, we can still employ the computationally more complex
weighted sum of X2 statistics within such categories (Davies, 1980).
Thus, by using such a weighted x2 statistics approach, we plan to ex-
tend JEPEG to include other important functional categories such as
methylation tagging SNPs, Dnase hypersensitivity sites and histone
marks.

We note that JEPEG and its summary statistics-based imputation
module (DIST) offer best performance when the pairwise LD matrix
of the study cohort and reference panel is identical. Thus, when the
study and reference population are not ethnically well matched or
the study cohort is multiethnic, JEPEG might provide suboptimal re-
sults including some spurious signals. However, our extensive simu-
lation experiments (e.g. Fig. 2) suggest that JEPEG might be
reasonably robust to (non-African) intracontinental LD patterns of
variation.

JEPEG is written in C++ with open-source numerical libraries.
JEPEG software along with database of eQTL SNPs, reference pan-
els, usage instructions and examples are publicly available at http://
code.google.com/p/jepeg. For more details on (or usage of) the direct
imputation method employed internally by JEPEG, please see http://
code.google.com/p/dist. We welcome user critiques and suggestions
for improvement regarding the method itself and the functional SNP
database.

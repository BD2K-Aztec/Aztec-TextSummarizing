ABSTRACT

Summary: Drugster is a fully interactive pipeline designed to break the
command line barrier and introduce a new user-friendly environment
to perform drug design, lead and structure optimization experiments
through an efficient combination of the PDB2PQR, Ligbuilder,
Gromacs and Dock suites. Our platform features a novel workflow
that guides the user through each logical step of the iterative 3D struc-
tural optimization setup and drug design process, by providing a
seamless interface to all incorporated packages.

Availability: Drugster can be freely downloaded via our dedicated
server system at http://www.bioacademy.gr/bioinformatics/drugster/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Drugster is a fully integrated, Perl/Tcl—Tk based, interactive plat-
form combining in a rational pipeline the algorithms of
PDB2PQR V.l.8 (Dolinsky et al., 2004, 2007), Ligbuilder v.l.2
and v.2.0 Wang et al., 2000; Yuan et al., 2011), Gromacs v.4.5.5
(Hess et al., 2008) and Dock v.6.5 (Lang et al., 2009). All previ-
ously mentioned algorithms remain a native set of numerous
UNIX-based modules, lacking a comprehensive and object-
oriented graphical user interface (GUI). Therefore, Drugster
was developed to ease and automate the full task of setting up
drug design, lead and structure optimization experiments. All
major 3D molecular viewers can be used for visualization pur-
poses. In this study, we used Pymol (DeLano, 2002) as molecular
viewer. In the beginning, Drugster addresses all common prob-
lems associated with PDB file formatting and partial charges.
Subsequently, the receptor will be structurally optimized by
energy minimization using a variety of different force fields as
implemented into Gromacs. Upon structural optimization, the
Ligbuilder algorithm is used to generate novel molecules for the
given site or to improve an existing lead compound. Dock is used
to verify and evaluate the potential of each newly designed
ligand, as it is used to re-score all candidate compounds and
search for better docking interactions. Finally, the receptor—

ligand complex is energetically minimized, to reduce any residual
geometrical strains, and subsequently subjected to molecular dy-
namics simulations (MDs), allowing full degrees of freedom to
both the ligand and the receptor. There is an option for a final
energy minimization step after the MDs.

2 DESCRIPTION OF DRUGSTER

Drugster’s main window is a menu-driven interface as well as a
tab step-by—step layout (Fig. 1A). It provides the user with a
process window to monitor active calculations in real time as
well as with a command-line equivalent (Fig. 1B).

A complete drug design and/ or lead and structure optimization
experiment using the Drugster toolkit is broken down in five steps:

(1) Input preparation.
This is a crucial step missing from most major suites,
where all common PDB file problems are automatically
fixed before the experiment. There are some other plat-
forms that provide tools for protein preparation, but
they include modules that are commercially available
even for academic use (Lill et al., 2011; MOE, 2010;
Sybyl, 1994). Missing hydrogens are added, partial charges
are calculated, heteroatoms can be removed and the C’
and N’ termini of the protein can be neutralized.

(2) Receptor optimization.
One of the major drawbacks of structure-based drug
design algorithms is the lack of conformational optimiza-
tion of the receptor. Using the versatile Gromacs suite, the
receptor is energetically minimized before the de novo drug
design experiment. This automated step addresses many
inconsistencies and free energy issues that may derive by
removing heteroatoms, without restoring to the ‘relaxed’
conformation of the receptor PDB file, which will be used
for the generation of new ligands.

(3) Ligand building.
At this stage, the actual de novo structure-based drug
design of new ligand structures takes place. This tab en-
ables the user to fully parameterize the ligand-building
process, by offering support to both Ligbuilder 1.2 and
2.0 versions. Here the process is organized in three fully
user-customizable phases. First a pharmacophore is pre-
pared, which prepares and summarizes the 3D properties

of the scaffolding, common core structures that will be
later generated and analysed. Then the user has the
choice of either the growing or the linking algorithms of
Ligbuilder. The combination of molecular fragments starts
automatically as soon as the user has completed the par-
ameters setup section (i.e. molecular weight, number of
donors/acceptors, LogP and other chemical properties).
The third phase is the compound screening function,
where the elite molecules are selected for the next step.
(4) Ligand optimization and re-scoring.

All ligand candidate molecules prepared in the previous
step are subjected to docking simulations using Dock,
which are followed by energy minimizations (EM) within
the receptor. The ligand molecules are then re-scored and
re-ranked. Notably at this stage, EM is performed allow-
ing full degrees of freedom for both the ligand and the
receptor. This way a certain degree of receptor flexibility
is allowed to the iterative drug design process. The
re-scoring approach is based on free energy perturbation
and compound—receptor interaction analysis. The scoring
functions included in Dock are fast and versatile, offering
a reliable set of tools for scoring and re-ranking our can-
didate compounds. Finally, ligand topologies can be either
automatically assigned or manually using freely available
dedicated software (Malde et al., 2011; Schiittelkopf et al.,
2004)

(5) Complex optimization.

The final step of the Drugster pipeline is the automatic
error-prone feeding of the top scoring candidate com-
pounds to the Dock’s molecular dynamics engine. Here
options include a force field selector, generator for the
coordinate and topology files, the setup of a periodic
system, solvation and the actual molecular dynamics simu-
lation. Basic, but rather informative, post MD simulation
trajectory analysis has been incorporated to aid the user to
speed up the selection of the best candidate compounds
(Fig. 1C).

Furthermore, an extensive manual for the use of Drugster will
pop-up through the Help button (Fig. 1D), using the system’s
default HTML browser. Notably, through the Drugster inter-
face, it is possible to start a log file, which is vital for keeping
track of all useful information that may prove to be
time-consuming and complicated for some users. Moreover,
the status tray area provides information about the logging pro-
cess plus a process interruption switch. There are three progress
indicators, a progress bar showing the current step as a fraction
of the total steps, a label showing an estimation of the remaining
run time and the percentage (%) of work completed. A proces-
sor, memory and swap ﬁle usage gauge is to be found right next
to the logging indicator, providing real time information of the
system’s resources. Calculations and step counts are done by
Drugster. Noteworthy, all input, output and intermediate files
are automatically stored in user predefined directories for further
analysis, simulation/experiment resuming, error tracing and
archiving purposes.

3 CONCLUSIONS

In conclusion, the Drugster toolkit provides a novel,
user-friendly, fast and reliable tool for conducting drug design
experiments, with the incorporation of a series of elite molecular
modelling algorithms in one platform. It is a fast and easy-to—use
alternative to rather expensive commercial suites, while being the
only modern and updated tool of its kind that is fully distributed
as freeware.

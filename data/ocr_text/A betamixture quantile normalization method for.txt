ABSTRACT

Motivation: The Illumina lnfinium 450 k DNA Methylation Beadchip is a
prime candidate technology for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies
(EWAS). However, a difficulty associated with these beadarrays is that
probes come in two different designs, characterized by widely differ-
ent DNA methylation distributions and dynamic range, which may bias
downstream analyses. A key statistical issue is therefore how best to
adjust for the two different probe designs.

Results: Here we propose a novel model-based intra-array normal-
ization strategy for 450k data, called BMIQ (Beta Mlxture Quantile
dilation), to adjust the beta-values of type2 design probes into a stat-
istical distribution characteristic of type1 probes. The strategy involves
application of a three-state beta-mixture model to assign probes to
methylation states, subsequent transformation of probabilities into
quantiles and finally a methylation-dependent dilation transformation
to preserve the monotonicity and continuity of the data. We validate
our method on cell-line data, fresh frozen and paraffin-embedded
tumour tissue samples and demonstrate that BMIQ compares favour-
ably with two competing methods. Specifically, we show that BMIQ
improves the robustness of the normalization procedure, reduces the
technical variation and bias of type2 probe values and successfully
eliminates the type1 enrichment bias caused by the lower dynamic
range of type2 probes. BMIQ will be useful as a preprocessing step for
any study using the Illumina lnfinium 450 k platform.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past few years, the ﬁeld of epigenomics has risen to prom-
inence (Feinberg, 2010; Petronis, 2010). Epigenomics not only
offers an improved understanding of fundamental biological
processes such as cellular differentiation and early embryo genesis,
but is also widely recognized to be key in understanding
the pathogenesis of complex genetic diseases like cancer

(Baylin and Ohm, 2006; Feinberg et al., 2006; Jones and Baylin,
2007). One particular epigenetic mark of interest is DNA methy-
lation. Indeed, DNA methylation markers have been proposed as
early detection, diagnostic and prognostic markers in a wide range
of different diseases (Rakyan et al., 2011). Underpinning this
increased interest in epigenomics are significant advances in bea-
darray technology, which now allow routine measurement of
DNA methylation at over thousands of CpG dinucleotides
(Bibikova et al., 2009, 2011; Sandoval et al., 2011). Among
these, the Illumina Infinium 450 k Human Methylation
Beadchip offers both scalability and coverage (>480 000 probes)
and is thus suitable for Epigenome-Wide Association Studies
(EWAS) (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011; Rakyan et al., 2011;
Sandoval et al., 2011).

A key statistical issue with the Illumina 450 k beadchip is that
probes come in two different designs, which causes the methyla-
tion values derived from these two designs to exhibit widely dif-
ferent distributions (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011). Indeed, type2
probes are typically characterized by a much lower dynamic
range compared with type1 probes, even after adjustment for dif-
ferences in biological characteristics such as CpG density
(Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011). Comparison with bisulphite pyrose—
quencing data further showed that type2 probe values are biased
and generally less reproducible (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011). To
correct for this bias, a peak-based correction (PBC) method was
proposed (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) which normalises type2
design probes so as to render them comparable with type1
probes. Making the statistical distributions of type1 and type2
probes comparable is important for several reasons. Not doing
so may introduce an enrichment bias towards type1 probes when
ranking probes in supervised analyses, as the dynamic range of
type1 probes is significantly higher. Moreover, methods that seek
to determine differentially methylated regions (J affe et al., 2012)
also assume that probes within these regions are comparable and
thus one would want to avoid any sources of technical variation
within them. Finally, one would wish to apply unsupervised di-
mensional reduction algorithms (Houseman et al., 2008; Koestler
et al., 2010) and classiﬁcation algorithms (Zhuang et al., 2012) to
one single dataset, and not separately to two different assays.

Although the PBC method was validated in one dataset
(Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) and has now been implemented in
a pipeline for 450k data Wang et al., 2012), two recent studies
have exposed potential problems with PBC, specially when

applied to tissue samples (Maksimovic et al., 2012; Touleimat
and Tost, 2012). In fact, as noted in these studies, PBC breaks
down when the methylation density distribution does not exhibit
well-deﬁned peaks/modes. Hence, both studies proposed subset
quantile normalization methods (SQN and SWAN) to correct
for the type2 bias and which avoid the pitfalls of PBC
(Maksimovic et al., 2012; Touleimat and Tost, 2012). In this
work, we show that PBC often leads to discontinuities (‘holes’)
in the type2 density distribution. To address this problem, we
here propose a novel mixture model-based normalization algo-
rithm, called Beta MIxture Quantile dilation (BMIQ). We sub-
ject BMIQ to a rigorous evaluation using numerous independent
datasets and using a number of different evaluation criteria to
assess its robustness and performance. Speciﬁcally, we assess
BMIQ in terms of reducing (i) the technical variance, (ii) the
type2 bias, (iii) and the above-mentioned type1 enrichment
bias. We further benchmark BMIQ against PBC and SWAN.
For assessing technical variance and to allow a comprehensive
comparison of BMIQ to PBC/SWAN across many datasets, we
use in addition to replicates, a novel evaluation framework based
on using adjacent type l—type2 probe pairs within probe clusters,
a framework which we show leads to consistent and robust con-
clusions across 10 independent datasets. We demonstrate that,
overall, BMIQ compares favourably to PBC and SWAN.

2 METHODS
2.1 Biological data: DNA methylation

Illumina lnﬁnium 450k DNAm assay The DNA methylation
data considered in this work were all generated using Illumina’s
Inﬁnium Human Methylation 450k beadchip. Full details of this tech-
nology are described in Bibikova et al. (2011) and Sandoval et al. (2011).
Brieﬂy, the methylation value of each probe follows an approximate ,8-
valued distribution, with ,8 constrained to lie between 0 (unmethylated
locus) and l (methylated). This follows from the deﬁnition of ,8 as the
ratio of methylated to combined intensity values, i.e

M

'B:U+M+e

(1)
where U and M are the unmethylated and methylated intensity values of
the probe (averaged over bead replicates) and e = 100 is a small correc-
tion term to regularize probes of low total signal intensity (i.e. probes
with U + M R 0 after background subtraction). Throughout we used
non—background-corrected DNAm data. Of the 485 577 probes, 72%
are of a type2 design in which the U and M measurements are obtained
in different colour channels, while the rest (28%) of the probes are of the
old type1 design in which both U and M measurements are obtained in
the same colour channel. Importantly, type1 and type2 probes differ sig-
niﬁcantly in terms of CpG density, with Cst mapping to Cst islands
overrepresented among type1 probes (Bibikova et al., 2011; Sandoval
et al., 2011).

Datasets I and 2.‘ (ET) and (CL) This is a subset of the 450k
dataset considered in Dedeurwaerder et al. (2011). We used the data from
eight fresh frozen (FF) breast tumours and eight normal breast tissue
specimens [hereafter refered to as (BT)], as well as the three replicates
from the HCT116 WT cell-line [hereafer refered to as (CL)]. For these
cell-lines, matched bisulphite pyrosequencing (BPS) data were available
for nine type2 probes.

Datasets 3 and 4.‘ (FFPE) and { FF ) This 450k dataset consists
of 32 formalin-ﬁxed parafﬁn-embedded (FFPE) head and neck cancers

(HNCs), of which 18 were HPV+ and 14 HPV—, as well as ﬁve fresh
frozen HNCs (FF), of which 2 were HPV+ and 3 HPV—. The data are
available from GEO under accession number GSE38271.

Dataset 5 .' {GBM} This 450k dataset consists of 81 glioblastoma
multiformes (GBMs) (Turcan et al., 2012), 49 of which were categorized as
CpG island methylator positive (CIMP+) and 32 as CIMP—.

Datasets 6—10: TCGA, LIV, LC, BLDC, HCC These 450k
samples are all from the TCGA: Speciﬁcally, Dataset6 (TCGA) consists
of 10 samples as provided in the Bioconductor data package
TCGAmethylation 450 k, Dataset7 (LIV) consists of nine normal liver
tissue samples from Batch203 in the TCGA data portal, Dataset8 (LC)
consists of 22 lung cancer samples from Batchl96, Dataset9 (BLDC)
consists of 12 bladder cancer samples from Batch86 and Dataseth
(HCC) consists of 10 hepatocellular carcinoma samples from Batch153.

2.2 BMIQ: Beta MIxture Quantile dilation
normalization strategy

The normalization of type2 probe values into type1 must satisfy the
following criteria. (i) It must allow for the different biological character-
istics of type1 and type2 probes, i.e type1 probes are signiﬁcantly more
likely to map to CpG islands than type2 probes, and hence the relative
proportion of methylated and unmethylated probes will vary between the
two designs. In the case of the type2 probes, this means that these pro-
portions must be invariant under the normalization transformation. (ii)
The transformation of the type2 probe values should reduce the bias,
which amounts to matching of the density distributions of the two
design types, specially at the unmethylated and methylated extremes.
(iii) The transformation must be monotonic, that is, the relative ranking
of beta values of the type2 probes must be invariant under the transform-
ation. Next, we propose a normalization strategy for the type2 probes
satisfying the above properties and which is based on three steps:

0 Fitting of a three-state (unmethylated-U, hemimethylated-H, fully
methylated-M) beta mixture model to the type1 and type2 probes
separately. For sake of convenience we refer to intermediate allelic
methylation as hemimethylation even though hemimethylation
is most often used in the context of strand-speciﬁc methylation.
Let {(612,173) (612,172,), (afw, denote the parameters of the
three beta distributions for the type1 probes, and similarly let
{(615,175) (aﬂbﬁ), (aﬁﬂﬁﬂ describe the estimated parameters of
the three beta components for the type2 probes. State membership
of individual probes is determined by the maximum probability
criterion.

0 For those type2 probes assigned to the U-state, transform their
probabilities of belonging to the U-state to quantiles using the in-
verse of the cumulative beta distribution with beta parameters
(613,173) estimated from the type1 U component. Let 77115 denote
the normalized values of the type2 U-probes.

o For those type2 probes assigned to the M-state, transform their
probabilities of belonging to the M-state to quantiles using the in-
verse of the cumulative beta distribution with beta parameters
(ofwbﬁl) estimated from the type1 M component. Let 77g], denote
the normalized values of the type2 M-probes.

o For the type2 probes assigned to the H-state, we perform a dilation
(scale) transformation to ‘ﬁt’ the data into the ‘gap’ with endpoints
deﬁned by max{ng} and min{n§{4}.

We next describe each of the above steps in detail. We ﬁrst model each
beta value ,8 as,

Adjusting design bias in 450k studies

 

where B denotes the beta probability density function and t denotes the
design type t = (1,11). We infer the parameters (71, a, b) using an
Expectation Maximization (EM) algorithm as described in (Ji et al.,
2005). The estimated parameters we denote again by (71;, a2, 17;) where t

labels the design and S one of the three states (U, H,M). The resulting
means of the estimated beta-distributions are denoted by m; where

Further, let U”, H”, M11 denote the set of type2 probes assigned to
unmethylated, hemimethylated or fully methylated states (using the max-
imum probability criterion), and let Uf, (U5) denote the set of U11 probes
with ,8-values smaller (larger) than  Similarly, let M f, (M 5) denote the
set of M11 probes with ,8-values smaller (larger) than  This subdivision
into values which fall left (L) or right (R) of the mean are necessary since
the state membership probabilities estimated from the EM algorithm are
two tailed. Next, for the Uf, probes we estimate their type2 tail probabil-
ities of belonging to the U—state, i.e p = P(U|,8U%I) = F(,8U%I lag, 175) where
F denotes the cumulative distribution beta function. We then transform
these probabilities back to quantiles (i.e ,8-values), but using the type1
parameters, i.e

6] = Flwlaﬁsbﬁ) (4)

and ﬁnally set the normalized ,8-value, 7711;] = q. An identical transform-
ation (using 1 — F instead of F) is performed for the U5 probes. Next,
we perform the analogous operation for the Mﬁ and Mg probes. This
therefore yields normalized type2 values for all type2 U and M probes.

Finally, it remains to normalize the type2 H probes. Since the type2 H
probe value distribution is sandwiched between the U and M probe dis-
tributions, we can use an empirical approach to normalize these values,
thus also bypassing the difﬁculty that type2 H probe values are not well
described by a beta distribution (Supplementary Fig. S1). Speciﬁcally, we
ﬁrst identify the minima and maxima of the type2 H—probes,
maxH = max{,8g,} and minH = min{,8g,}, and let A55) 2 maxH — minH.
We also ﬁnd the minimum of the M -probes, i.e minM = min{,8j{4} and the
maximum of the U—probes, i.e. maxU = max{,8[[§}. We point out that in
fact all of these extrema represent robust values, because they do not
represent extrema on the bounded (0,1) support, i.e. the values
maxU,minH, maxH and minM are not close to 0 or 1. Next, we deﬁne
distances

AUH = minH — maxU

AHM = —maxH+ minM

We want the new normalized maximum and minimum values of
H—probes to satisfy

nmaxH = min{ng14} — AHM

nminH = max{ng} + AUH

so that A53) 2 nmaxH — nminH. The normalized ,8-values for the
H—probes is then given by the conformal (shift + dilation) transformation

77% = nminH + a’f(,8g, — minH) (5)

where df = AEWAE? is the dilation factor. It is important to observe that
the conformal transformation involves a non-uniform rescaling of the
H probe beta values since it depends on the beta-value of the probe.
This is absolutely key in order to avoid gaps or holes from emerging in
the normalized distribution.

This algorithm is ﬂexible in that the dilation can be performed also
including the M f, (and/ or the UR)H) probes, which means that the match-
ing of the density distributions is only done on the respective tails (i.e. the
Mg and Uf, probes). We point that in practice we ﬁnd that the optimal
performance is attained by including the Mf, probes with the H—probes

when performing the conformal transformation. This is because we
observed that it is the left tail end of the methylated type2 distribution
that is generally not well described by a beta-distribution (Supplementary
Fig. S1), presumably as a result of the dye bias, which is speciﬁc to the
type2 distribution.

There are a number of other important points to note about BMIQ: (i)
First, it is important to choose reasonable initial weight parameters
{71(5), 715?), 71%} in the EM-algorithm. As these fractions can vary signiﬁ-
cantly from study to study, or even sample to sample depending on the
nature of the samples assayed, it is important to choose reasonable initial
values on a per-sample basis. Not doing so may result in mild disconti-
nuities in the type2 density distribution. To obtain estimates for these
prior weight parameters, we ﬁrst note that their estimation only requires
estimates for the two thresholds used for calling the three states, since the
weights for a given sample are determined given a choice of thresholds.
Moreover, although the thresholds will show little inter-sample variabil-
ity, the weights may not, reﬂecting the biological differences in the
number of probes that are unmethylated, hemimethylated or fully methy-
lated. In BMIQ, the estimation of the initial thresholds proceeds in an
automatic fashion on a per-sample basis: in detail, we use the estimated
thresholds from the type1 distribution (which always gives an excellent ﬁt,
Supplementary Fig. S1) to then obtain type2-speciﬁc thresholds using a
simple correction reﬂecting the difference in the modes between the type1
and type2 distributions. Speciﬁcally, if 1,? is the lower threshold
(i.e. type1 ,8 values less than I)? are called unmethylated) and UM“)
and UMUI) are the estimated modes of the unmethylated type1 and
type2 components, the intial prior estimate for 1(5) would
be 1,7) 21,? + (UMUI) — UM<I>). Similarly, the threshold for calling
probes fully methylated or just hemi-methylated would be
1%?) = 1%? + (MMUI) — MM‘O) where MM denotes the mode of the
methylated state. We note that resulting thresholds would normally
fall within the ranges 0.2—0.3 and 0.60—0.8, respectively. Having thus
identiﬁed reasonable initial estimates for the weights {719,719,719},
the algorithm will then automatically determine the unmethylated, hemi-
methylated and methylated fractions for each sample individually.
(ii) A second important observation is the overall robustness of BMIQ
to the goodness of the type2 EM-ﬁt. This is important, since we consis-
tenly observe that the methylated type2 distribution is not well described
by a beta function (Supplementary Fig. S1). In this regard we have
also veriﬁed that using a beta mixture model with more than three
states does not improve the overall type2 ﬁt. Fortunately however, as
explained above, the goodness of ﬁt problem associated with the H
and M—probes can be easily circumvented by modelling only the right
tail of the methylated component as the corresponding tail of a beta
distribution. In this case, the left tail is modelled together with the H-
probes using the observed empirical distribution. Hence, the probe values
that are not well described by a beta distribution are not normalized using
estimated beta parameters, which means that their normalization is in-
sensitive to the goodness of ﬁt.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Improved robustness of BMIQ

To validate BMIQ, we ﬁrst applied it to data where the PBC
method has been shown to work reasonably well. Thus, we
applied it to a fresh frozen breast tumour sample from
Datasetl (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011) (Fig. 1A). We can see
that for this particular sample, the methylated type1 peak is
well deﬁned and as a result both PBC and BMIQ appear to do
well in generating smooth density distributions for the type2
probes, which at the methylation extremes are also reasonably
well matched to the type1 density distribution. Next, we applied
both PBC and BMIQ to the FFPE tumour samples from

Dataset3, for which the type1 methylated peak was not well
deﬁned (Fig. 1B). In these samples, PBC generated a type2 dens-
ity distribution that exhibited relatively sharp changes (‘holes’)
(Fig. 1B), suggestive of a non-optimal adjustment and indicating
that in such cases PBC breaks down. This is not suprising since
PBC relies heavily on the ability to detect clear unmethylated and

methylated modes in the type1 density distribution in order to
then adjust the type2 distribution accordingly. Importantly,
BMIQ does not use the type1 modes to adjust the type2 data,
and hence BMIQ normalization of the type2 probes generated a
much smoother density distribution, suggestive of an improved
normalization framework (Fig. 1B). Moreover, the tail ends of
the BMIQ type2 distribution better matched those of the type1
distribution without affecting the fractions of unmethylated,
hemimethylated and fully methylated probes, which are pre-
served by the BMIQ transformation.

3.2 BMIQ reduces technical variation

To further test BMIQ we applied it to Dataset2 (CL) consisting
of three replicates of a given cell-line, to investigate if reprodu-
cibility is improved. First, we computed for each of the probes its
standard deviation across the three replicates and for each of the
three scenarios: no normalization, PBC and BMIQ. As seen,
BMIQ performed similarly to PBC and led to a signiﬁcant re-
duction in inter-replicate variability (Fig. 2A). To check this fur-
ther, we compared the normalization methods in terms of the
Euclidean distance between the three possible pairs of replicates
across the type2 probes (Fig. 2B). Using this measure, BMIQ not
only led to a signiﬁcant improvement, but was also marginally
better than PBC (Fig. 2B).

3.3 BMIQ reduces bias of type2 methylation values

Using replicates to evaluate normalization methods assesses the
method in terms of reducing technical variability but does not
evaluate whether the actual values of the replicates are closer to
the true estimate. This requires comparison with a gold-standard,
which is provided by matched BPS data (Dedeurwaerder et al.,
2011). Hence, we compared the methods in terms of the devi-
ations from BPS methylation values for the nine type2 probes in
Dedeurwaerder et al. (2011) for which matched 450k BPS data
were available. Similar to PBC, we observed that BMIQ signiﬁ-
cantly reduced the bias of type2 values (Fig. 3), although there
was no improvement over PBC itself, presumably owing to the

fact that in these speciﬁc samples the methylated type1 peak was
well deﬁned, a scenario in which PBC works well.

3.4 BMIQ eliminates the type1 enrichment bias

To further test BMIQ, we considered the supervised context, in
which a ranked list of probes correlating with a phenotype of
interest is derived. Given the higher dynamic range of type1
probes, one expects that this would favour type1 probes and
that therefore there would be a relative over enrichment of
type1 over type2 probes in a top ranked list of probes.
However, one key difﬁculty when assessing whether there is a
bias towards type1 probes is that type1 and type2 probes differ
signiﬁcantly in terms of their biological characteristics, in par-
ticular in terms of CpG density. Hence, in order to avoid con-
founding by CpG density, we only selected probes that mapped
to CpG islands and to 200 bp upstream of the TSS, thus allowing
a sensible comparison between type1 and type2 probes. We con-
sidered three different datasets and derived for each a ranked list
of probes associated with a phenotype of interest: breast cancer
versus normal breast [Datasetl (BT)], HPV + versus HPV—HNC
[Dataset3 (FFPE)], and CIMP+ versus CIMP— (GBM)
(Dataset5). The ranking was performed using the magnitude of
differential methylation. Although this ranking does not take the
within-phenotype variability into account, it remains a popular
method (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2011; Du et al., 2010), and for our
purposes, using the absolute difference in beta-values allows us
to better interpret the performance of the different normalization
methods. To assess any potential bias towards type1 probes, we
computed for a given number of top ranked probes the odds
ratio (OR) of relative enrichment of type1 over type2 probes.
Across all three datasets, we indeed observed a bias towards
type1 probes, although the severity of this bias varied substan-
tially from study to study (Fig. 4). Using PBC, in one dataset this
bias was eliminated; however, in the other two datasets, PBC
overcorrected the data leading to a bias favouring type2

probes. In contrast, BMIQ eliminated the type1 enrichment
bias in all three datasets (the resulting OR was always close
to 1) without overcorrecting the data and avoiding the type2
enrichment bias seen for PBC.

3.5 Reduced technical variability within probe clusters

To further assess BMIQ, we devised an evaluation framework
which exploits the well known spatial correlation of DNA
methylation at scales <500 bp (Eckhardt et al., 2006).
Approximately 27% of the 450k probes fall into 12501 probe
clusters, deﬁned as contiguous regions containing at least seven
probes with no two adjacent probes separated by >300 bp (Jaffe
et al., 2012). Within these probe clusters, we posited that pairs of
adjacent probes, one from each design and within 200 bp of each
other, should have similar methylation values. Among the 12 501
probe clusters we identiﬁed on the order of ~30 000 of such
adjacent type1—type2 probe pairs. Thus, to evaluate the normal-
ization algorithms, we asked which one minimizes the absolute
difference in methylation between such closely adjacent type 1—
type2 pairs. We considered a total of 10 independent datasets,
seven of which had idat ﬁles, thus allowing also for a direct
comparison with SWAN (Maksimovic et al., 2012). For each
dataset, we computed the mean of the absolute deviations over
probe pairs and samples. Comparison of these average deviations
revealed that BMIQ consistently reduced the technical variation,
while also outperforming PBC and SWAN (Table 1). In fact, in
9 of 10 datasets, BMIQ was substantially better as assessed using
a paired Wilcoxon rank sum test over all probe pairs and samples
(Table 1). Example methylation proﬁles within these probe
clusters conﬁrmed that BMIQ successfully reduces the technical
variability, while PBC can break down either overcorrecting
or suppressing the type2 data values, leading to substantial dif-
ferences in methylation between neighbouring probes, even at
scales of <100 bp (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S1).

3.6 BMIQ robustly identiﬁes features associated
with HPV status

Finally, it must be veriﬁed that the reduction in technical vari-
ance obtained with BMIQ is not at the expense of a reduced
biological signal. Since it is difﬁcult to establish what constitutes
a true positive, we used a training test set strategy, to identify
features in a training set and calling them true positives if vali-
dated in a test set. This strategy thus allows for a comparison

lation between adjacent type1—type2 probe pairs (probes within 200 bp of
each other), averaged over probe pairs and samples, for four different

of sensitivity and positive predictive value (PPV) between the
different normalization methods. To perform this analysis,
we used Dataset4(FF) consisting of 2 HPV+ and 3 HPV—
fresh frozen head and neck cancers to derive features associated
with HPV status. As test set we used Dataset3(FFPE) consisting
of 18 HPV+ and 14 HPV— head and neck cancers (FFPE
tissue). Using limma (Smyth, 2005) and an FDR threshold
of 0.35, we observed that BMIQ identiﬁed substantially more
differentially methylated features than PBC or SWAN
(Table 2). Importantly, this was not at the expense of a smaller
PPV, and so, overall, BMIQ identiﬁed substantially more
true positives (Table 2).

In this work we have presented a novel mixture-model-based
algorithm (BMIQ) for correcting the bias associated with
type2 probe values in 450 k studies. Conﬁrming the observations

Adjusting design bias in 450k studies

 

made in Touleimat and Tost (2012) and Maksimovic et al.
(2012), we have seen that PBC can break down in samples
with ill-deﬁned type1 methylation peaks, causing sharp, almost
discontinuous changes (which we call ‘holes’) in the density dis-
tributions (Fig. 1B), which motivated our quest to ﬁnd a more
robust algorithm. We have shown that BMIQ improves the
robustness and can successfully normalize the type2 distribution,
avoiding the appearance of such ‘holes’ (Fig. 1B). Moreover,
BMIQ successfully matches the tail-ends of the type1 and
type2 distributions, while faithfully preserving the proportions
of unmethylated and methylated probes within each of the
two designs.

To further test BMIQ, we used data on technical replicates (to
show that it reduces technical variability) and matched BPS data
(to show that it reduces the bias of type2 probe values). Using
these criteria, we have seen that BMIQ leads to signiﬁcant im-
provements, similar to the improvements noted for PBC (Figs 2
and 3). In relation to these evaluation criteria, it is worth point-
ing out that BMIQ was compared with PBC on samples with
well-deﬁned type1 methylation peaks, i.e. on data that were used
to develop PBC itself. Hence, it is likely that an evaluation of
technical reproducibility (using replicates) and type2 value bias
(using matched BPS data) on data where the methylated type1
peaks are less well-deﬁned would favour BMIQ over PBC.
However, we did not have access to technical replicates or
matched BPS data in the other speciﬁc datasets considered
here. Therefore, in order to further assess BMIQ, we devised a
supervised framework across three independent datasets to ob-
jectively compare the algorithms in their ability to reduce the
expected enrichment bias of type1 probes. First, we showed
that if no design normalization is performed then there is
indeed an enrichment bias towards type1 probes, even when ad-
justed for CpG density (Fig. 4). We also showed that in two
datasets, PBC overcorrected the type2 data, leading to an over-
inﬂated dynamic range, thus favouring type2 probes and causing
an ‘overshooting’ of the enrichment scores, reﬂected by a signiﬁ-
cant underenrichment of type1 probes (Fig. 4B and C). In con-
trast, BMIQ successfully avoided any type1/type2 enrichment
bias in all three datasets, indicative of an improved normaliza-
tion of type2 values (Fig. 4). We should point out that the over-
correction of type2 values and the associated overinﬂated
dynamic range caused by PBC is consistent with the presence
of ‘holes’ in the hemimethylated region of the type2 density dis-
tribution. Thus, with PBC there is an artiﬁcial expulsion of data
points from the hemimethylated region to the unmethylated and/
or methylated extremes. In a further assessment of BMIQ, we
conducted a detailed spatial analysis of DNA methylation at the
level of probe clusters across 10 independent datasets. By care-
fully analysing adjacent typel—type2 probe pairs, we observed
that PBC can often overcorrect or suppress the data (in some
cases inducing abnormally large 30% changes in methylation), in
contrast to BMIQ, which normalized type2 values in a way that
rendered them more consistent with the values of neighbouring
type1 probes (Fig. 5 and Table 1). Interestingly, BMIQ also
appeared to outperform SWAN (Table l), which is part of the
popular and widely used minfi package (Hansen and Aryee,
2012). Of note, the reduction in technical variance achieved
by BMIQ was not at the expense of a lower biological
signal (Table 2).

In summary, using a number of different evaluation criteria
and numerous datasets, we have seen that BMIQ compares fa-
vourably with both PBC and SWAN. Although we did not com-
pare BMIQ to SQN (Touleimat and Tost, 2012), this latter
method is very similar to SWAN, as they both rely on a probe
subset quantile normalization. Like SQN/SWAN, BMIQ uses
quantiles to normalize the type2 probe values into a distribution
that is comparable with that of type1 probes. However, unlike
SQN and SWAN, BMIQ is based on an explicit beta-mixture
modeling framework, and uses state-membership probabilities
under this beta mixture model to reassign the quantiles of
the type2 probes according to the type1 distribution. Thus,
BMIQ is assumption-free, as it does not require a separate
normalization to be performed on selected subsets of probes
that are matched for biological characteristics (e. g. CpG density),
as done in SQN and SWAN. In fact, under the BMIQ frame-
work, all the biological differences (including CpG density)
between the type1 and type2 probes are captured by the esti-
mated fractions of unmethylated, hemimethylated and methy-
lated probes, which will be different between the two assays.
Thus, BMIQ does not depend on a priori and somewhat
arbitrary choices of which biological characteristics to use
when matching the type1 and type2 distributions. For instance,
in SQN the normalization is performed on probe subsets deﬁned
by speciﬁc CpG characteristics (e.g. shelves, shores, CpG is-
lands); however, multiple different deﬁnitions for say CpG is-
lands exist (Gardiner-Garden and Frommer, 1987; Takai and
Jones, 2002; Wu et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2009). Similarly, in
SWAN the number of Cst in the probe body, even if they
differ by one, is used to deﬁne probe normalization categories,
and thus it is unclear whether these probe categories represent an
optimal way of dividing the probes up. Therefore, we see the
beta-mixture model framework of BMIQ as an important con-
ceptual advantage over SQN/SWAN, since, as demonstrated
here, it successfully normalises type2 probe values, faithfully pre-
serving the numerous and complex biological differences that
exist between the two designs without ever needing to deﬁne
probe subsets. Nevertheless, it will be interesting to conduct a
comprehensive and detailed comparison of BMIQ, SQN and
SWAN on matched 450k BPS data on a sufﬁciently large
number of loci and samples.

5 CONCLUSIONS

We have presented a mixture model assumption-free normaliza-
tion algorithm, BMIQ, which will be useful for correcting the
bias associated with the type2 assay in DNA methylation studies
using the Illumina Inﬁnium 450k platform.

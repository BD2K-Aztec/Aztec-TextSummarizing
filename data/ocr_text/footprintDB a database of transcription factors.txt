ABSTRACT

Motivation: Traditional and high-throughput techniques for deter-
mining transcription factor (T F) binding speciﬁcities are generating
large volumes of data of uneven quality, which are scattered across
individual databases.

Results: FootprintDB integrates some of the most comprehensive
freely available libraries of curated DNA binding sites and systematic-
ally annotates the binding interfaces of the corresponding TF3. The
first release contains 2422 unique TF sequences, 10112 DNA binding
sites and 3662 DNA motifs. A survey of the included data sources,
organisms and TF families was performed together with proprietary
database TRANSFAC, finding that footprintDB has a similar coverage
of multicellular organisms, while also containing bacterial regulatory
data. A search engine has been designed that drives the prediction of
DNA motifs for input TFs, or conversely of TF sequences that might
recognize input regulatory sequences, by comparison with database
entries. Such predictions can also be extended to a single proteome
chosen by the user, and results are ranked in terms of interface simi-
larity. Benchmark experiments with bacterial, plant and human data
were performed to measure the predictive power of footprintDB
searches, which were able to correctly recover 10, 55 and 90% of
the tested sequences, respectively. Correctly predicted TFs had a
higher interface similarity than the average, confirming its diagnostic
value.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription is one of the most important processes in gene
expression, and it is modulated primarily by the binding of regu-
latory proteins called transcription factors (TFs) to short DNA
sequences, called cis elements or DNA binding sites (DBSs). The
DBS recognition mechanism is generally degenerate, as one TF
can usually bind to a collection of similar but different cis elem-
ents, which can be grouped together to deﬁne a DNA motif.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Motifs are most frequently represented as position-speciﬁc scor-
ing matrices (PSSM) that capture the occurrence of nucleotides
in aligned positions of the underlying DBSs (Stormo, 2000).
Furthermore, motifs are frequently plotted as sequence logos,
which graphically summarize the binding speciﬁcities and/ or afﬁ-
nities of TFs (Schneider and Stephens, 1990) (see Supplementary
Fig. S1).

Traditional experimental methods to identify DBSs are tech-
nically challenging and have been frequently limited to determin-
ing cis-regulatory sites for one TF at a time. These methods such
as DNA footprinting or electrophoretic mobility shift assays
(Galas and Schmitz, 1978; Garner and Revzin, 1981; O’Neill
and Turner, 1996) yield high-quality data and have been the
primary source of data for expert-curated databases such as
RegulonDB (Salgado et al., 2013). However, these approaches
do not scale well and are currently being replaced by protocols
that allow high-throughput discovery of DBSs, such as protein
binding microarrays, ChIP—chip or ChIP—Seq experiments
(Berger and Bulyk, 2006; Johnson et al., 2007; Ren et al.,
2000). These procedures produce large volumes of raw sequence
data, which must be preprocessed and ﬁltered to derive DNA
motifs. Databases such as JASPAR (Portales-Casamar et al.,
2010) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2006) are increasingly
annotating DBSs produced by such protocols, fueled by articles
that report experimentally derived DBSs and motifs for large
repertoires of TFs (Down at al., 2007; Jolma et al., 2013;
Noyes et al., 2008)

On other side there are experimental approaches for charac-
terizing the interface residues of TFs, those in charge of
recognizing the nucleotide bases of target cis elements. Beyond
site-directed mutagenesis (O’Neill et al., 1998; Shortle et al.,
1981), the most accurate methods are X-ray crystallography
and nuclear magnetic resonance studies of protein—DNA com-
plexes. The resulting structures are maintained and published at
the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). By further
digesting these structural models, the 3D-fooprint database rou-
tinely annotates the interfaces of all DNA binding proteins con-
tained therein, following simple geometrical criteria: interface
residues must form hydrogen bonds or hydrophobic contacts
with nitrogen bases or else locate heavy atoms within 4.5A of
any nitrogen base (Contreras-Moreira, 2010).

Here we present footprintDB, a meta-database, which inte-
grates the most comprehensive freely available libraries of
curated DBSs and systematically annotates, for the ﬁrst time,

the binding interfaces of the corresponding TFs. Furthermore,
we survey the redundancy of all included databases and compare
them with TRANSFAC, a subscription-based commercial alter-
native. Besides allowing users to compare DNA sequences/
motifs with records in the database, as most included repositories
do, footprintDB can also interrogate complete proteomes to
identify which TFs are likely to recognize input cis elements.
Annotated interfaces are particularly valuable for the second
type of query, as our benchmarks indicate that TFs with similar
interface residues are more likely to bind to similar DBSs. The
three unique features of footprintDB are as follows: (i) the pos-
sibility to search against multiple curated databases at the same
time or to add custom databases, (ii) the annotation of interface
residues within DNA binding protein domains and (iii) the sup-
port for browsing TFs within user-provided proteomes, which
are most likely to bind a DBS of interest. This resource is avail-
able at http://ﬁoresta.eead.csic.es/footprintdb.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

FootprintDB is by design a meta-database of TFs attached to their
experimentally determined DNA binding preferences (PSSMs and/or
DBSs). Therefore it does not incorporate other databases that contain
only TF, DBS or predicted regulatory sequences. The ﬁrst building block
is 3D-footprint (Contreras-Moreira, 2010), a database for the structural
analysis of protein—DNA complexes, for two reasons: (i) it is to our
knowledge the only up-to-date source of annotated binding interfaces
of TFs, and (ii) it contains structure-based PSSMs, motifs inferred
from cis elements captured in X-ray and nuclear magnetic resonance
complexes, that have been independently validated (AlQuraishi and
McAdams, 2011; Lin and Chen, 2013). The remaining databases and
repositories currently integrated in footprintDB are as follows:

(1) JASPAR CORE (2009 version, all species redundant set): a high-
quality collection of TF DNA binding preferences, modeled as
PSSMs (Portales—Casamar et al., 2010).

(2) UniPROBE (Universal PBM Resource for Oligonucleotide
Binding Evaluation, Sep 2012 version): it contains in vitro DNA
binding speciﬁcities of proteins measured with universal protein
binding microarrays (Robasky and Bulyk, 2011).

(3) ‘HumanTF’: a sequence-speciﬁc binding preferences of human TFs
obtained by high-throughput SELEX and ChIP sequencing. It in-
cludes a total of 830 binding proﬁles, describing 239 distinctly
different binding speciﬁcities (J olma et al., 2013).

(4) Athamap: a genome-wide map of potential TF binding sites in
Arabidopsis thaliana (Bulow et al., 2009).

(5) RegulonDB (7.5 version): it contains curated data of the transcrip-
tional regulatory network of Escherichia coli K12, including
PSSMs and DBSs for many TFs (Salgado et al., 2013).

(6) DBTBS (Database of transcriptional regulation in Bacillus subti-
lis): a database of transcriptional regulation in B.subtilis (Sierro
et al., 2008).

(7) ‘DrosophilaTF’: motifs for 56 Drosophila melanogaster TFs built
from in vitro binding site selection experiments and compiled
genomic binding site sequences (Down at al., 2007).

In addition to these freely available data sources, we also tested
TRANSFAC (2012.1 version), a subscription database with TFs, their
experimentally proven binding sites and the corresponding PSSMs
(Matys et al., 2006). TRANSFAC is a popular resource in this

community and was thus included in our benchmarks. All these data
sets were retrieved, curated, completed when necessary (for instance by
searching for TF sequences for GenBank/Uniprot identiﬁers) and im-
ported into our meta-database using custom Perl scripts. To standardize
these tasks, we created the footprintDB data format, which bundles to-
gether TF and DBS sequences, motifs and links to supporting literature
and original sources. This format is a blending of ‘matrix.dat’, ‘factor.dat’
and ‘site.dat’ TRANSFAC ﬁles in a single ﬁle, as shown in
Supplementary Figure S2. By adopting these formats, a friendly web
interface allows users to update and insert data for their own private
applications, or rather make them available to the community.

Along the article we will refer to footprintDB as the sum of the for-
merly listed data sources, excluding TRANSFAC.

2.2 Database structure and web application

Different aspects were considered when conceiving the database, some of
them biological and some relevant for data modeling. Transcription con-
trol is a complex mechanism, still not completely understood, and this
must be considered in the design. For instance, a single TF can bind to
several possibly degenerate DBSs within the same or different genomic
regions, or often the same cis element is recognized by several TFs. Other
relevant questions are redundancy among sources, miscellaneous anno-
tation formats, incomplete annotation of entries and availability of data
retrieval systems. All these factors made footprintDB have a complex
relational schema, shown in Supplementary Figure S3. The web applica-
tion is written in PHP and J avaScript, with Perl scripts running the
queries. Sequence logos are built with Weblogo (Crooks et al., 2004).
The database runs a MySQL engine on an Apache server. A SOAP
web services interface is available at http://ﬂoresta.eead.csic.es/foot
printdb/ws.cgi. The online documentation includes examples on how to

query it.

2.3 Annotation of TF interfaces and Pfam domains

TF sequences in footprintDB have their DNA binding interfaces anno-
tated by means of BLASTP alignments (Altschul et al., 1990) against the
3D-footprint library (http://floresta.eead.csic.es/3dfootprint/download/
list_interface2dna.txt) with an E-Value threshold of 10. Aligned interface
positions from one or more protein—DNA complexes are thus transferred
to entries in the database. A benchmark with 127 TFs comparing other
machine learning interface-inference tools showed that this straightfor-
ward BLAST-based strategy is the most accurate among sequence-based
methods, as shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

Pfam domains (Punta et al., 2012) were also annotated for all TF
sequences using HMMSCAN from the HMMER 3.0 suite (Finn et al.,
2011). Family-speciﬁc E-Value thresholds were optimized to reduce false-
positive matches, according to benchmark experiments summarized in
Supplementary Figure S5.

2.4 Analysis of data redundancy

Two kinds of redundancy were deﬁned and measured: internal and
external. Internal redundancy is deﬁned as the number of redundant
DNA motifs (PSSMs) and TF sequences from the same source, whereas
external redundancy is estimated with respect to other sources. Internal
redundancy of DNA motifs was measured aligning all PSSMs from the
same data source against each other with STAMP (Mahony and Benos,
2007), taking the best hit to deﬁne nearest neighbor clusters of similar
DNA motifs. Two E—Value thresholds were tested to deﬁne redundancy,
1E-10 and 1E-5; motifs with lower E—Values were clustered together and
labeled as redundant. Internal redundancy of TF sequences was measured
running CD-HIT (Li and Godzik, 2006). Two sequence identity thresh-
olds were tested, 90 and 50%, so that aligned sequences with higher
identity percentages were clustered together. External redundancy of

either DNA motifs or TFs was estimated comparing PSSMs or protein
sequences across data sources. External redundancy values estimate how
many data entries from each database have similar values in the other
databases. These values are asymmetrical because comparisons can be
made in both ways: A versus B and B versus A. Redundant data
among footprintDB, TRANSFAC and JASPAR CORE were clustered
and Euler diagrams drawn with eulerAPE V2.0 (available from http://
www.eulerdiagrams.org/eulerAPE), as depicted in Figure 3. These dia-
grams illustrate data redundancy among the three main repositories, con-
sidering that JASPAR CORE is by design contained in footprintDB.

2.5 Protein sequence and DNA motif search

The search engine of footprintDB relies on a Perl script that implements
protein sequence searches with BLASTP (Altschul et al., 1990) and DNA
motif scans with STAMP (Mahony and Benos, 2007). Protein searches
take FASTA format sequences as input and by default accept hits with a
maximum E—Value of 1. Results can be ordered by increasing E—Value or
by decreasing interface similarity. Interface similarity is calculated using a
scoring matrix that gives score 1 to amino acids with similar physico-
chemical properties and 0 to the rest (Supplementary Fig. S6). Motif
searches are carried out by STAMP using as input a PSSM in
TRANSFAC format. Other accepted inputs are single or multiple
DNA sequences, which will be internally converted to PSSMs. The align-
ment algorithm is an ungapped Smith—Waterman implementation, which
extends matched motifs with a maximum E—Value of 1. The scoring func-
tion is the Pearson Correlation Coefﬁcient of aligned matrix columns.
Motif similarity is deﬁned as the sum of column Pearson Correlation
Coefﬁcient values. Results can be ordered by increasing E—Value or by
decreasing motif similarity. Besides these standard alignment scores, the
output table resulting from DNA searches is colored according to twilight
thresholds: green matches correspond to reliable motif alignments, where-
as motifs over a red background cannot be guaranteed to be correctly
aligned (Sebastian and Contreras-Moreira, 2013).

2.6 External proteome search

A remarkable feature of footprintDB is that it allows extending database
searches to external proteomes. By doing this, users can transfer search
results, which only consider annotated TFs and DNA motifs, to other
species of interest. This extension step requires running BLASTP with a
default E-Value threshold of 0.01. Note that this parameter can be tuned.
When possible, resulting hits have their interface residues predicted, so
that they can be sorted with respect to the original annotated TFs in the
database.

2.7 Benchmark

Three test datasets and three representative species were chosen to bench-
mark the predictive ability of footprintDB: (i) A.thaliana data from
Athamap; (ii) E.coli data from RegulonDB and (iii) a subset of 100 ran-
domly selected DNA motifs and their associated TFs from ‘HumanTF’.
Each dataset consisted of DNA motifs recognized by a single TF and TFs
recognizing a single DNA motif. Benchmark searches were performed by
setting aside each test set from the meta-database, ﬁrst excluding and then
including annotated data for the corresponding species. Both protein and
DNA searches were evaluated:

(1) The TF benchmark consisted in scanning protein sequences against
footprintDB+TRANSFAC and then comparing the predicted
motifs to the cognate DNA motif of the query. If one of the
matched PSSMs is signiﬁcantly similar to the cognate motif
(STAMP E 5 1E-5), the result is stored together with its rank,
E-Value, motif similarity, BLASTP E-Value, interface similarity,
organism and data source.

(2) The DNA benchmark was done by searching input motifs from all
three test datasets looking for putative binding homologous TFs
within the corresponding proteomes (versions: A.thaliana TAIR9,
E.coli U000096.2 and Homo sapiens GRCh37.58). Hits were com-
pared with the TF associated to the query and deﬁned as correct
with a percent sequence identity >90.

Figure 5 illustrates how the benchmark was done, and the sets of
obtained predictions are provided as Supplementary Material.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Database contents

The ﬁrst release of footprintDB contains 2422 unique TF
sequences, 3662 PSSMs and 10 112 DBSs. As we added the con-
tents of TRANSFAC version 2012.1 to the analysis, these num-
bers increased signiﬁcantly to 4923, 5349 and 21988, respectively
(see Table 1). In the next section, redundancy analyses are per-
formed to fairly evaluate the richness of each data source.

The most populated species among footprintDB sources, as
compared with TRANSFAC and JASPAR CORE, are shown in
Figure 1A, together with the corresponding number of TF se-
quences annotated in each data source (full statistics are reported
as Supplementary Material). We notice that the TF binding pref-
erences of a few organisms are widely covered, such as human,
mouse, yeast, ﬂy or E.coli. This coverage could already be sufﬁ-
cient for many applications in the case of human or mouse,
considering current estimations of the repertoire of TFs in the
human genome Waquerizas et al., 2009). However, other species
such as A.thaliana, maize or rice (among plants) or mammals like
cow, pig and sheep have a shallow coverage. Moreover, the ana-
lysis unveils that some organisms are better covered by
TRANSFAC (for instance Gallus gallus, Rattus norvegicus or
X enopus laevis), whereas others, such as bacteria, are only con-
sidered by open-access libraries such as DBTBS. In the Section
2.7, we assess to what extent well-explored species can help make
predictions on the remaining.

The most frequent DNA binding domains found in the ana-
lyzed databases are also summarized in Figure 1B (see also
Supplementary Material). It can be seen that Homeobox and

Zinc ﬁngers, widely studied in the literature, are overrepre-
sented. Furthermore, we note that prokaryotic RegulonDB
and DBTBS databases do not contain such proteins; instead
they are enriched in typical bacterial regulatory proteins, such
as helix-turn-helix TFs. One of the unique features of
footprintDB is the annotation of interface residues of TFs.
This annotation relies on the 3D-footprint database, which rou-
tinely dissects the interfaces of protein—DNA complexes de-
posited at the PDB, as explained in Figure 2A. Alignments
between amino acid sequences of TFs and homologous pro-
tein—DNA complexes thus drive the transfer of experimentally
determined interface residues to equivalent residues of
footprintDB entries. Overall, 97% of the total TFs are anno-
tated with this procedure, with most resulting interfaces com-
prising 7—16 amino acid residues (Fig. 2B), in agreement with
previous values calculated for Homeobox and Zinc ﬁnger
families (Contreras-Moreira et al., 2009) (full interface length
statistics are reported as Supplementary Material). As we show
later, annotated interfaces are a good ﬁlter to decide whether
two TFs might be recognizing the same DBS, as required when
extending footprintDB searches to external proteomes.

3.2 Survey of data redundancy

To estimate the degree of redundancy of the data sources inte-
grated in footprintDB, we compared data entries within and
between databases, as explained in Section 2. When checking
internal redundancy, it turns out that some of the largest repo-
sitories such as TRANSFAC, JASPAR CORE, HumanTF,
UniPROBE and the whole footprintDB contain from 20 to
40% redundant DNA motifs, depending on the similarity cutoff
E—values used to compare PSSMs (1E-5 and 1E-10, respectively,
see Supplementary Table S3). For TF sequences, we report an
even higher redundancy: 40—70% within footprintDB,
TRANSFAC and 3D-footprint entries and slightly lower per-
centages in HumanTF (24—53%) due to proteins with percent
sequence identity higher than the 90 and 50% cutoffs, respect-
ively (see Supplementary Table S4). JASPAR motif redundancy
was anticipated as we analyzed on purpose the all-species redun-
dant set for completeness.

External redundancy is even more relevant to evaluate the
added value of each data source. The data in Table 2 summarize
the performed comparisons in terms of DNA motifs, indicating
that all eukaryotic data sources contain a large fraction of re-
dundant entries among them. This is expected, as databases such
as JASPAR and TRANSFAC are built, at least in part, by
curating the same literature, and therefore overlap substantially.
In fact, TRANSFAC contains 438 DNA motifs identical to
JASPAR entries (see Supplementary Table S5). This number
increases to 1332 if we consider TRANSFAC PSSMs that
align to JASPAR entries with STAMP E g 1E-10, which we con-
sidered as a cutoff for nearly identical motifs. Besides, these
analyses conﬁrm the minimum redundancy between bacterial

aA redundant version of JASPAR was tested.

Note: The main diagonal shows the total number of PSSMs in each source (bold). Motifs aligned with STAMP E-values<lE-10 were called redundant. Second row
corresponds to the union of all individual data sources that contribute to footprintDB. Note that a large fraction of 3D-footprint entries are not called redundant within
footprintDB because their short DNA motifs fail to produce alignments with E-values< lE-10.

sources (RegulonDB and DBTBS) and the rest. Note that exter-
nal redundancy estimates are asymmetrical, as different results
are obtained depending on the direction of the comparison.

The picture arising from the comparison of TF sequences
across data sources reveals their analogous levels of redundancy
(see Supplementary Table S6). For instance, 368 TRANSFAC
TFs have identical amino acid sequences in JASPAR; this ﬁgure
increases to 1062 if we apply a 90% sequence identity redun-
dancy cutoff.

After reviewing the full set of comparisons in Supplementary
Tables S5 and S6, it can be concluded that there is an ‘eclipse
effect’: as we relax the redundancy thresholds, eukaryotic data-
sets progressively overlap till most of their contents turn to be
shared. This behavior is shown in the Euler diagrams in Figure 3
for the three main databases footprintDB, TRANSFAC and
JASPAR CORE (which is included in footprintDB).

Perhaps the most interesting case is the overlap between
footprintDB and TRANSFAC (Fig. 3, Table 2 and
Supplementary Tables S5 and S6). They share 22% of motifs
and 14% of TRANSFAC TFs (Fig. 3A and D). If nearly iden-
tical DNA motifs (E g 1E-10) and TFs (with percent sequence
identity 290) are considered, these percentages increase to 71%
of motifs and 56% of TFs (Fig. 3B and E). Further relaxing these
thresholds to E 5 1E-5 (short motifs or motifs that share a
common pattern but not the whole motif) and sequence identity
250% (proteins with common domain architecture) then both
databases are almost equivalent, as they seem to share 95% of
motifs and 98% of TFs (Fig. 3C and F). Such data overlap is
also noticeable for JASPAR.

3.3 Web site

The web interface of footprintDB displays the main menu on the
left side, which provides access to the current list of publicly
available data sources and to the search engine, in addition to
the documentation (Supplementary Fig. S7). By default anonym-
ous users can perform any of these tasks:

(1) Listing the included repositories, their versions, references
and authors, with links to the original Web sites. From this

table it is possible to browse TFs, DNA binding motifs
(PSSMs) and DBSs curated in each individual data source.

(2) Accessing a single entry (TF, PSSM or DBS) to display all
the available information for that record, including refer-
ences to primary literature and experimental evidence, and
download them in TRANSFAC format (example in
Supplementary Fig. S8).

(3) Key word search of TF, PSSM or DBS accessions. The
form supports ﬁltering by database, organism or related
TF domain and results can be downloaded in
TRANSFAC format.

(4) Sequence search, to scan protein or DNA sequences and
PSSMs. The search process is explained in the next section.

In addition, registered users have access to the following extra
features:

(1) Storing and reusing previous searches.

(2) Inserting/removing their own databases in TRANSFAC
or footprintDB formats.

3.4 Search engines and external proteomes

The main purpose of footprintDB is to support searching for
annotated TFs and/or regulatory sequences, as depicted in
Figure 4. The search engine is designed primarily to receive
two types of queries: (i) a DNA consensus motif, PSSM or site
and (ii) a protein sequence of a putative DNA binding protein.
Therefore, two kinds of output will be produced, respectively, (i)
a list of DNA binding proteins predicted to bind a similar DNA
motif and (ii) a list of DNA motifs recognized by similar proteins
annotated in any of the included data sources. Search results can
be sorted by E-value, motif similarity or interface similarity.
Moreover, the user can also look for homologs in a third party
species, by simply specifying an appropriate proteome in the
formulary dropdown list or by uploading a custom proteome
in FASTA format. Together with the standard search results,
this option produces a list of homologous proteins with their
interfaces annotated. Interface predictions can then be used to
ﬁlter out BLASTP hits displaying a signiﬁcantly different set of

Fig. 4. Main search types supported by footprintDB. Light arrow (top):
if the input data are a DNA sequence or motif, the search is powered by
STAMP, and the output are proteins likely to bind sequence similar to
the input. These proteins might be primary entries in footprintDB or
rather endogenous TFs of a proteome of choice, after a secondary call
to BLASTP. Dark arrow (bottom): when the input is a protein sequence,
a BLASTP search is performed instead and the user gets a list of putative
DNA target sites for it

DNA binding residues. This kind of search is useful to scan TFs
within a particular organism of interest, for instance to design
laboratory experiments. We further illustrate this kind of search
in the next section.

3.5 Example of footprintDB search

Imagine that we have obtained a set of cis elements regulated by
a bZIP TF in the genome of Antirrhinum majus. Take for in-
stance motif bZIP910, annotated in JASPAR and AthaMap,
shown in Supplementary Table S8. Now, we have just found
out that some of these DBSs are also conserved in A.thaliana,
and want to identify the endogenous TFs that might recognize
them, so that we can test them in the laboratory. To perform
such a query, we ﬁrst paste the input DNA sequences in the
search formulary to obtain a list of similar motifs in the data-
base. Among the top four results are bZIP910, XBPl and TGAl,
annotated in different sources and species (snapdragon, human,
thale cress and tobacco). All of them are motifs bound by TFs of
the bZIP family (basic leucine zipper domain), using a similar

binding interface. However, as we go down the list, motifs start
to diverge and hence have associated higher E-values.

If we extend this search by scanning proteins within the
A.thaliana TAIR9 proteome, we ﬁnd 30 proteins with interfaces
identical to that of the query (bZIP910, with interface signature
RNRSASR), which should be the best candidates to be tested
in the laboratory for binding. In addition, these results could
guide site-directed mutagenesis experiments targeting interface
residues. The second hit (human XBPl) produces a list of
21 A.thaliana TFs, but an inspection of their interfaces
(RKNRAAARK) shows clearly that these are a different sub-
family of TFs. Furthermore, these interfaces are in all cases simi-
lar but not identical to that of the corresponding human TF. For
these reasons, the second row of results should be handled with
care. Finally, the third and fourth hits, TGAl from A.thaliana
and tobacco, link to up to 10 endogenous proteins with identical
interfaces (RQNRAASR), which are similar to the ﬁrst 30 can-
didate TFs, and therefore should also be considered for further
analyses.

3.6 Search benchmark

The ﬁrst benchmark consisted in scanning A.thaliana TF se-
quences and DNA motifs from Athamap against
footprintDB+TRANSFAC, after excluding all A.thaliana
entries. Figure 5A and B summarize both experiments, and can
be extended to the second and third benchmarks explained
below. Overall, 31 out of the 56 tested TFs (55%) were recovered
in the TF search, and 27 out of 48 DNA motifs (56%). Among
recovered TFs and motifs, 24/31 and 13/27 were ﬁrst hits, re-
spectively. It is remarkable that most hits were annotated in
TRANSFAC, mainly from other plants, human or mouse. In
both experiments, the average interface similarities of correctly
recovered TFs were 80 and 91%, compared with overall values
of 58 and 78%, respectively, as shown in Figure 5C. When all
A.thaliana records were put back in footprintDB (still excluding
Athamap), the percentages of recovered TFs and motifs
increased to 70 and 83%, respectively. Again most results were
derived from TRANSFAC, suggesting that, together with
Athamap, it is the most comprehensive source of plant regula-
tory data.

The second benchmark consisted in scanning E.coli sequences
from RegulonDB against footprintDB+TRANSFAC, after
excluding all E.coli records. In total, only 9 of 82 tested TFs
(12%) were successfully retrieved in the TF search, and 8 of 82
DNA motifs (10%). Among these, 6/9 and 5/8 were ﬁrst hits,
respectively. Most matches were from B.subtilis entries annotated
in DBTBS and 3D footprint. In both cases, average interface
similarities of recovered TFs were ~69 compared with 54%
among all predictions. When E.coli records were included back
in footprintDB, the percentages of recovered TFs and motifs
increased to 18 and 20%, respectively.

The third benchmark consisted in scanning TF sequences
and DNA motifs from ‘HumanTF’ against footprintDB+
TRANSFAC, after excluding all human records. In total, 100
of 100 tested TFs, and 90 of 100 DNA motifs, were recovered.
Overall, 87/100 and 69/90 were ﬁrst hits, respectively. Matched
records were from model multicellular organisms, mostly mouse,
but also ﬂy, worm or frog, generally annotated in TRANSFAC

dictions to the cognate sequences, which are taken to be correct or false
in terms of STAMP E—value (A) and percent sequence identity 03), as
explained in Section 2. In the TF experiment (A), 31 of 56 Athamap
sequences (55%) were successfully recovered. In the corresponding ex-
periment with DNA motifs (B), the footprintDB pipeline recovered 27 of
48 (56%) Athamap motifs. (C) Interface similarity of correct hits and of
all predictions among A.thaliana, E.coli and human test sets used during

or JASPAR. In both experiments, average interface similarities
of recovered TFs were 86 and 96% compared with 52 and 91%
for all predictions. When human records were added back to
footprintDB, the percentages of recovered TFs and motifs
remain the same, but now some best hits were human.

4 DISCUSSION

F ootprintDB is an effort to group and unify the most important,
diverse and well-annotated open access databases of experimen-
tally obtained TF binding preferences. Although a few other re-
sources have a similar philosophy (Portales-Casamar et al., 2010;
Riva, 2012), footprintDB goes one step further by systematically
annotating interface residues, those that capture the binding spe-
ciﬁcity of DNA binding proteins. This allows linking motif simi-
larity with TF similarity and supports scanning TFs with

conserved interfaces in external proteomes. The observed high
values of interface similarity among correctly recovered TFs in
our benchmarks, compared with the average values among all
predictions, conﬁrm their value as a quality control when trans-
ferring regulatory annotations by homology.

The search engine is perhaps the most remarkable feature of
footprintDB. It can drive the prediction of DNA binding motifs
for unknown TF sequences, and also the opposite search, assign-
ing putative TFs to input DNA motifs, which might have been
found during in silico promoter analyses. Our benchmarks suggest
that footprintDB has predictive power, as it was able to correctly
recover TFs and motifs from E.coli, A.thaliana and H.sapiens.
However, the performance was better with eukaryotes than with
bacteria, as the tested data sources are evidently more redundant
for multicellular organisms. This observation exposes that the pre-
dictive ability of footprintDB is proportional to the richness of its
data sources. In our experience, correct results are obtained most
frequently when TF sequences or DNA motifs from phylogenet-
ically related organisms are available in the database. For instance,
in our A.thaliana TF benchmark, ﬁrst hits captured the correct TF
in 24 of 31 cases. Overall, 21 of these 24 matches were to plant
sequences, including species such as Zea mays, Helianthus annuus,
Nicotiana tabacum, Brassica napus, Amajus, Hordeum vulgare,
Solanum lycopersicum, Daucus carota and Oryza sativa. In con-
trast, the E.coli test had limited success, as the only available ref-
erence organism was B.subtilis, which in fact is only remotely
related. Beyond these benchmark experiments, footprintDB has
already been proﬁtably applied for identifying endogenous rice
TFs (OsEREBPl and OsEREBP2) that bind speciﬁcally to a
target sequence within the OsRMC promoter (Serra et al.,
2013). Furthermore, footprintDB has also been extensively
tested during the in silico identiﬁcation of drought stress regula-
tory proteins in A.thaliana, which have been later validated with
yeast one-hybrid experiments. Preliminary results further conﬁrm
that correct predictions are provided by phylogenetically related
entries, which are annotated in the database, otherwise results are
not reliable (data not shown). Another important result of this
unpublished work, which is relevant in this context, is that DNA
searches seem to be more sensitive with single cis elements as input
than with PSSMs.

This study is also an up—to-date comprehensive comparison
of TF databases. F ogel et al. made a statistical analysis of an
early version of TRANSFAC (F ogel et al., 2005), whereas other
articles have studied the similarity of motifs annotated in
TRANSFAC and JASPAR (Kielbasa et al., 2005; Schones et al.,
2005). In our study, we ﬁnd signiﬁcant data redundancy between
TRANSFAC and JASPAR databases. However, the most signiﬁ-
cant overlap found is between footprintDB and TRANSFAC, as
summarized in Figure 3. These analyses suggest that footprintDB
and TRANSFAC contain overall almost equivalent data, so
footprintDB can be currently used as an open-access alternative,
bearing in mind that organism coverage is also an important factor,
as already discussed in the A.thaliana benchmark. It remains to be
seen whether available funding will allow footprintDB (and its
integrated datasets) to keep the pace of scheduled updates of com-
mercial alternatives such as TRANSFAC.

Signiﬁcant internal redundancy is observed among TF se-
quences of 3D footprint, ‘HumanTF’ and TRANSFAC, as
well as footprintDB. In the ﬁrst case, this is mostly explained

in terms of the intrinsic redundancy of the PDB. With respect to
‘HumanTF’, the observed redundancy is due to the fact that this
source includes both complete protein sequences and domains of
orthologous TFs from mouse and human. A similar explanation
is valid for TRANSFAC, which appears to frequently annotate
orthologous TFs from relates species. Inspection of the resulting
clusters suggests that most redundant TFs at 90% of sequence
identity are probably inparalogs and orthologs from phylogen-
etically close organisms. Inspection of relaxed clusters (50%
sequence identity cutoff) unveils that they gain more divergent
homologous proteins of the same family, which bind to regula-
tory elements using the same Pfam domains.

Although our survey reveals a comprehensive coverage
of human and murine TFs, both in TRANSFAC and in open-
access repositories, it also shows that prokaryotes are still
only served by specialized expert-curated resources such as
RegulonDB and DBTBS. In fact these organism-speciﬁc reposi-
tories are reported to be the least redundant (as also observed for
DrosophilaTF). By combining freely available data sources,
footprintDB aims to be a reference meta-database covering bac-
teria, plants and animals, although our benchmark clearly shows
that its predictive power is greater for multicellular organisms.
Despite the wide coverage of this meta-database, our benchmarks
encourage the addition of any other relevant high-quality re-
sources/datasets, as we found out with the plant regulatory data.
For this reason the web interface allows users to import their own
data collections, which can optionally be shared with other users,
and we hope that the adoption of this tool by the community will
translate into a richer set of curated data repositories.

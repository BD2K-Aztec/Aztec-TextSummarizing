ABSTRACT

Motivation: DNA copy number profiles characterize regions of
chromosome gains, losses and breakpoints in tumor genomes.
Although many models have been proposed to detect these alter-
ations, it is not clear which model is appropriate before visual inspec-
tion the signal, noise and models for a particular profile.

Results: We propose SegAnnDB, a Web-based computer vision
system for genomic segmentation: first, visually inspect the profiles
and manually annotate altered regions, then SegAnnDB determines
the precise alteration locations using a mathematical model of
the data and annotations. SegAnnDB facilitates collaboration between
biologists and bioinformaticians, and uses the University of California,
Santa Cruz genome browser to visualize copy number alterations
alongside known genes.

Availability and implementation: The breakpoints project on INRIA
GForge hosts the source code, an Amazon Machine Image can be
launched and a demonstration Web site is http://bioviz.rocq.inria.fr.

1 INTRODUCTION

DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) are ampliﬁcations, gains
and losses of chromosomal regions that can result from different
cellular mechanisms, and are important in the study of many
types of cancer Weinberg, 2006). Genome-wide assays such as
array comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) and single
nucleotide polymorphism microarrays can be used to detect
CNAs. After spatial and sample normalization, these assays
yield noisy measurements of approximate copy number with a
resolution of up to R51 kb between probes.

The goal in analyzing these data is to accurately extract a list
of altered regions from each noisy sample. In this article, we
deﬁne accuracy in terms of annotated regions given by an
expert. We treat this expert as a gold standard, and so the goal

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

of our model is to be consistent with his or her annotations.
Hocking et al. (2013) observed large annotation error rates for
several segmentation algorithms applied to a large database of
neuroblastoma tumors. In this article, we propose to eliminate
these errors with SegAnnDB, a computer vision system whose
model always agrees with the provided annotations.

Previous work in DNA copy number analysis can be roughly
divided into two categories of methods: visualization and math-
ematical models. This article combines these two lines of research
by proposing a mathematical model that can be iteratively
improved by adding visual annotations to zoomed scatterplots
of the data. First, we will review previous methods in both
categories.

Many software packages have been developed for visualiza-
tion of aCGH data. For example, Visualization and Analysis of
Molecular Proﬁles (VAMP) can be used for exploratory analysis,
or to visualize predicted alterations from a model (La Rosa et al.,
2006). Another visual analysis program is ChARMView, which
allows manual identiﬁcation of regions for signiﬁcance testing
(Myers et al., 2005). A potential problem with these programs
is that the displayed model is calculated before visualization, and
cannot be interactively updated.

Several Web sites for array CGH analysis have been proposed.
CGHweb allows visual comparison of several algorithms applied
to the same normalized proﬁle (Lai et al., 2008). ArrayCyGHt
and CAPweb provide normalization and copy number calling
(Kim et al., 2005; Liva et al., 2006). ISACGH supports analysis,
segmentation, visualization and export to the Ensembl genome
browser (Conde et al., 2007; Flicek et al., 2012). ArrayFusion
exports data and segmentations in formats suitable for genome
browsers (Yang et al., 2006). Like the method we propose in this
article, these Web sites facilitate collaboration with biologists.
Unlike these Web sites, our SegAnnDB software allows the
user to interactively update the displayed segmentation model.

In contrast to visual methods for alteration detection, math-
ematical models can be used to automatically predict lists of
alterations based on certain mathematical assumptions about
the data. The available mathematical models speciﬁcally
designed for detecting CNAs are summarized by Neuvial et al.
(2011). However, a major problem with this class of methods is

model selection. Given a particular dataset to analyze, it is
obvious to choose neither a particular model nor its tuning par-
ameters. How to evaluate which model is best?

Without doing more experiments, the only method of evalu-
ation is to plot the model alongside scatterplots of the data. A
good model should capture all visible alterations in the data and
should not predict any false-positive detections. This visual cri-
terion for model evaluation can be used by creating a database of
annotated regions that encode an expert’s interpretation of the
data (Hocking et al., 2013). In that study, default parameter
values of several models were shown to yield many false-positive
and false-negative detections. And even after tuning the param-
eters of each model, there were no models with perfect detection
accuracy.

In this article, we propose to solve this problem by inter-
actively annotating alterations in scatterplots of the data
(Fig. 1). Then our software selects a tuning parameter that
agrees with the user-deﬁned annotations and immediately
shows the updated model. If the displayed segmentation model
does not capture the alterations that are obvious from visual
inspection, then annotations can be added to correct the
model. A user-speciﬁc model can thus be iteratively improved
until it agrees with the annotator’s visual interpretation of the
data.

In addition, the annotations can be assembled into a database,
so we can apply algorithms that automatically recognize previ-
ously annotated patterns. We note that this computer vision ap-
proach has also been successful for recognizing phenotypes in
cell microscopy (Jones et al., 2009). After annotating a small
subset of the data, the system adapts to the annotations and
provides consistent predictions for unannotated data.

This article describes SegAnnDB, a Web-based free/open-
source implementation of this interactive genomic segmentation
model. The name is short for Segmentation and Annotation
DataBase, as annotations are stored in a database, which is
used by machine learning algorithms to ﬁnd an appropriate seg-
mentation. After interactive annotation, the learned segmenta-
tion model can be directly exported to the University of

SegAnnDB toby@sg.csljleehaejp Iogﬂn

 

  

California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser for viewing de-
tected alterations alongside known genes (Kent et al., 2002).

Finally, SegAnnDB promotes collaboration between biolo-
gists, doctors and bioinformaticians doing genome-wide copy
number analysis (Fig. 2). Collaboration using SegAnnDB is
simple: once a bioinformatician uploads a proﬁle, anyone with
a Web browser can create a user-speciﬁc segmentation model by
drawing annotated regions on the scatterplots (Fig. 1). This
makes it easy for people with expert prior knowledge but no
programming experience to browse the proﬁles and annotate
regions of interest (e.g. a biologist looking for alterations in
known oncogenes). After annotation, the bioinformatician can
download the annotations and segmentation model for further
analyses such as detection of common alterations in several
related samples, or survival regression based on the detected
alterations.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

In this section, we describe the general workﬂow when using a
SegAnnDB server for annotation-guided DNA copy number analysis.
Later in Sections 3 and 4, we give details about how the server inter-
actively calculates and displays the models.

2.1 Uploading proﬁles

The ﬁrst step of any analysis is to upload the normalized log ratio data to
the Web site. The data should be uploaded in gzipped UCSC bedGraph
format, as this is the format that will also be used to export the data for
viewing on the UCSC genome browser (Kent at al., 2002). The four-
column text-based bedGraph format is simple, so any bioinforrnatician
should be able to quickly convert data from any platform-speciﬁc format.

The bedGraph header line must contain the following three important
variables speciﬁc to SegAnnDB. The db variable should indicate the
genome version of the probe positions (e.g. db=hgl9). The
maxSegments variable speciﬁes the maximum number of segments
per chromosome for the initial SegAnnDB scatterplots, before manual
annotation (kmax in Section 3.1). The share variable controls who can
view the proﬁle:

0 share=public means all users of the Web site.

center. Before saving, the annotation can be changed by clicking the region. After saving, the displayed model is immediately updated to agree with the

Fig. 2. SegAnnDB exports data to the UCSC genome browser and fa-
cilitates collaboration between bioinformaticians and biologists. First,
proﬁle probe log ratio values are uploaded to a SegAnnDB server by
an uploader (Section 2.1). Then an annotator can plot the data and reﬁne
a segmentation model by adding annotations (Sections 2.2 and 2.3).
Finally, an analyst can send data to the UCSC genome browser, which
displays plots of the segmentation model with known genes (Section 2.4)

o A domain name such as share=stat.berkeley.edu 0r
sharezcurie . fr means only users with emails from the indi-
cated domain.

0 sharezprivate means only the user who uploaded it.

Proﬁles can be uploaded one at a time using the Web upload form or
several at a time by using the upload _prof iles .py command line
program. Once a proﬁle has been uploaded, it must undergo two main
processing steps before interactive annotation is possible. First, the log
ratio values and several maximum likelihood segmentation models are
saved in BerkeleyDB, a highly efﬁcient database system. Second, Portable
Network Graphics (PNG) scatterplots are generated for several zoom
levels (Supplementary Table S1). The only limit on the number of proﬁles
is the amount of disk space available on the SegAnnDB server.
Importantly, the amount of time and disk space required is linear in
the proﬁle size (Table l).

2.2 Plotting data and annotating breakpoints

Once a proﬁle has been uploaded and processed, it can be plotted and
annotated. From the home page or the list of proﬁles, clicking a proﬁle
name shows a zoomed out plot of all its chromosomes. Plots can be
zoomed to individual chromosomes and then zoomed further by clicking
the plot size links shown in Figure 1.

Each plot initially shows the uploaded data as black points and a
segmentation model as horizontal line segments (Fig. 1). We use vertical
dashed lines to draw the ‘breakpoints’, which are the change points in the
piecewise constant segmentation model.

The breakpoints in the displayed segmentation can be edited by adding
breakpoint annotations to the bottom half of the plot. There are two
types of breakpoint annotations: lbreakpoint means there is exactly
one breakpoint in the region, and Obreakpoints means there are no break-
points in the region. Dragging on an unannotated region creates a new
region with Save and Delete buttons, as shown in Figure 1. Before saving,
an annotation can be changed from lbreakpoints to Obreakpoints by
clicking the region. After saving the annotation, it is sent to the server,
which calculates the consistent segmentation model deﬁned in Section
3.1. The server immediately sends the consistent segmentation back for
display in the Web browser. Thus, the segmentation model can be itera-
tively updated by adding breakpoint annotations, until the displayed
breakpoint locations match the expert interpretation of the annotator.

As explained in Section 3.1, one of the two possible segmentation
models will be used: pruned dynamic programming (PrunedDP) or
SegAnnot. The color of the dashed vertical breakpoint lines indicates
the algorithm: green for PrunedDP and purple for SegAnnot. It is im-
portant to note that when the SegAnnot algorithm is used, there must be
a lbreakpoint annotation for each breakpoint in the segmentation. In
contrast, the PrunedDP algorithm can detect breakpoints in unannotated
reglons.

Note: The processing time includes calculating segmentation models and PNG scat-
terplots on a 2.9GHz Intel i7-3520M CPU. We show disk space occupied by a
proﬁle in the database (BerkeleyDB), the total size of the PNG images
(Scatterplots) and the size of the data ﬁle to upload and export to UCSC (Probes. gz).

2.3 Annotating copy number

After ﬁnding a model with appropriate breakpoints, copy number anno-
tations can be added to the top half of each plot to deﬁne copy number
status (Fig. 1). Each copy number annotation should deﬁne a region of
equal copy number: deletion, loss, normal, gain or ampliﬁcation
(Supplementary Table S2). More types of copy number annotations
can be deﬁned for speciﬁc projects by editing the SegAnnDB source
code. After adding or deleting a copy number annotation, SegAnnDB
updates the predicted copy number status of each segment of the proﬁle.
This is indicated by immediately updating the color of the displayed
horizontal line segments. This immediate genome-wide visual feedback
is crucial for avoiding accidental mistakes in annotation.

There are two special colors for horizontal line segments: green and
black. If a proﬁle has no copy number annotations, then all segments are
colored green. If a segment has several different overlapping copy number
annotations, it is colored black to indicate that it should be corrected.

Copy number status is generalized across segments of a proﬁle, so not
all segments need to be labeled. The segments with overlapping copy
number annotations are used to infer the copy number status of the
other unlabeled segments. However, one copy number annotation of
each type must be present to use this feature. For example, if there is
only one normal and one gain annotation on a proﬁle, then the rest of the
segments will be labeled as either normal or gain, and there will be no
segments labeled loss.

2.4 Exporting data to the UCSC genome browser

After a proﬁle has been appropriately annotated, a table of detected
alterations can be displayed by clicking the ‘Show alterations on the
UCSC genome browser’ link shown on the bottom of Figure l.
Clicking a button on that page exports the probes, annotations and seg-
mentation to the UCSC genome browser (Fig. 2). Although positions of
genes can not be viewed while annotating proﬁles on SegAnnDB, they
can be viewed alongside the exported segmentation model on the UCSC
genome browser (Fig. 3). Data from multiple proﬁles can be displayed at
the same time on UCSC, for rapid visual veriﬁcation of repeated alter-
ations in particular genes.

There are two methods for quickly navigating from SegAnnDB to
altered regions on the UCSC genome browser. First, shift-clicking any
annotated region opens a new Web page with the UCSC genome browser
zoomed to that region. Second, each proﬁle has an alterations table that
contains links to each detected breakpoint, gain, loss, ampliﬁcation and
deletion.

The annotations and displayed segmentation models can also be
downloaded for other analyses. For example, the annotations could be
used to develop better models for breakpoint detection or copy number
calling. Also, the displayed segmentation model could be used for further

3 ALGORITHM

In this section, we explain the algorithmic details of the models
used to detect breakpoints and CNAs.

3.1 Calculating the displayed segmentation model

To ﬁnd an appropriate segmentation model for each chromo-
some, we ﬁrst calculate a sequence of segmentation models, then
use the expert’s breakpoint annotations to choose a consistent
model.

Let y 6 [Rd be the normalized log ratios for one chromosome,
measured at positions p1<  <pd. This signal is drawn using
black points in Figure 1. Because of its speed and breakpoint
detection accuracy (Hocking et al., 2013), we segment using the
PrunedDP algorithm of Rigaill (2010). It calculates the least
squares segmentation 32" 6 [W for every k e {1, ...,kmax}
segments:

- d
,k _ argmin I_ I 2

such that ,u. has k — 1 changes

The PrunedDP algorithm returns a sequence of progressively
more complex segmentation models 331, ..., ﬁkma". For each
model size k, the segmentation 32" has the least squared error
among all models with k segments.

The maximum number of segments kmX is the only parameter
of PrunedDP. For interactive annotation on the SegAnnDB Web
site, we usually set km,X = 20, which means that up to 20 seg-
ments will be shown on the initial scatterplot, before manual
annotation. After annotation, if there are :20 breakpoint anno-
tations, then SegAnnot will be used instead of PrunedDP, as

explained below. For high-density arrays with many expected
breakpoints (e. g. chromothripsis), larger values may be speciﬁed
(e.g. km,X = 200). However, km,X = 20 was a reasonable
choice for even the high-density arrays that we analyzed
(Supplementary Fig. S1 and Supplementary Table S3).

The model selection problem is to choose one of the km,X
segmentation models, which we do using breakpoint annota-
tions. Let R0,R1 be the sets of Obreakpoints and lbreakpoint
annotations, respectively. These appear on the bottom half of
the scatterplots shown on SegAnnDB (Fig. 1). Each 7 e R0, R1
is an interval of base pairs, so to compare with the segmentation
model, we need to convert the model breakpoint locations to
base pairs. For each model size k, we estimate the set of base
pairs after which a change occurs using

80121)) ={I(pj+pj+1)/2I ify“,IF regime {1, ....d— 1}} (2)

Equation (2) deﬁnes a breakpoint for every change 33]]? 75 121’?“
in the model, at the base pair halfway between the probes
[(pj+pj+1)/2j. These breakpoint positions are shown using
dashed vertical lines on SegAnnDB scatterplots (Fig. 1).

We calculate the annotation error to determine which
PrunedDP models agree with the set of current breakpoint an-
notations. The annotation error e : {1, . . . , kmax} —> Z+ uses the
zero—one loss to judge agreement of the predicted breakpoints
307‘, p) and the annotated regions R0, R1:

1
we = Z 2 10301.12) 0 A e b) (3)

[3:0 FER];

The indicator function I is 0 when the model 32" predicts the
correct number of breakpoints in a region r, and 1 otherwise. If
the model with k segments has no annotation error e(k) = 0,
then we say that the segmentation 32" is consistent with the
given annotations. The set of consistent PrunedDP models is
K0 2 {k|e(k) = 0}.

SegAnnDB

 

If there are any consistent PrunedDP models, then |K0| >0
and we deﬁne the optimal number of segments as

arg min A
k* = — 4
k 6 K0 1k k0» ( )
where the predicted number of segments [$02) 6 {1, ...,kmax} is

learned using the log.s.log.d max margin interval regression
model on the other annotated chromosomes (Rigaill et al.,
2013). In short, k is a prediction function that minimizes the
average annotation error over all annotated chromosomes. So,
as annotations are added, the predicted set of breakpoints tends
to get more accurate (Fig. 4). To support fast model updates
during interactive annotation, the prediction function k is
learned in the background on the Web server. Equation (4) is
used to pick the consistent model kAe K0, which is closest to the
complexity of the predicted model k(y).

If there are no consistent PrunedDP models then |K0| = 0 and
we use the SegAnnot dynamic programming algorithm (Hocking
and Rigaill, 2012). SegAnnot exactly recovers the least squares
segmentation such that the annotation error is 0, meaning that
each R0 region has 0 breakpoints and each R1 region has exactly
1 breakpoint:

6 [Rd
such that

- d
ar nun
SegAnnot0,p,R1) = If :0.- — 102
1:1
(5)
W 6 R1, IB(M,p) 0 7| =1

and ,u. has no other changes

The constraint in (5) means that the estimated mean ,u. changes
once in each lbreakpoint region r e R1, and has no changes
elsewhere.

In summary, the displayed segmentation is given by

Ak* .
{ y if |K0| > 0 (6)

SegAnnot (y, p, R1) otherwise

By construction, this segmentation is consistent with the
breakpoint annotations R0, R1.

3.2 Calculating copy number state

Segments with overlapping copy number annotations are used to
infer the copy number status of unannotated segments on the
same proﬁle. Copy number status is inferred by learning a set of
up to four thresholds, between the ﬁve possible copy number
annotations (Supplementary Table S2). Each of these thresholds
is learned in the same way, which we explain below for just the
threshold between normal and gain.

Let N, G be the sets of normal and gain segment means, re-
spectively. Let there be n = |N| normal segments and g = |G|
gain segments, and let 1% <  < IA’nJrg be the ordered segment
means. We consider thresholds t, = (Y,- —I— Yi+1)/2 e [R for all
i e {1, ...,n + g — 1}. Given a threshold and a segment mean
m 6 IR, we predict copy number status

(7)

normal if m < I,
gain if m > t,

The best threshold minimizes the number of incorrectly pre-
dicted copy number annotations:

better breakpoint detection on test data. Note that dnacopy.sd sometimes
had lower test error than SegAnnDB in the other datasets we examined

The indicator functions I are 0 when the threshold 1, correctly

4 IMPLEMENTATION

In this section, we discuss the technologies required to implement
a Web-based interactive system like SegAnnDB.

4.1 Interactive scatterplots

Scatterplots of probe log ratio values are displayed quickly on
SegAnnDB, as they are pre-rendered and saved as bitmap PNG
images when a proﬁle is uploaded. Some zoom levels are scaled
in proportion to the number of probes, so high-density proﬁles
can result in large PNG images (Supplementary Table S1). Some
Web browsers do not render these large PNG images. For ex-
ample, current iPad Web browsers do not render images wider
than 20 000 pixels, so we deﬁned an “ipad” zoom level speciﬁc-
ally to accommodate this maximum possible zoom level. Among
desktop Web browsers, we found that Google Chrome works
best on several platforms.

Interactive model updates are implemented using the D3
Javascript library (Bostock et al., 2011). The basic idea is to
draw the segmentation model and breakpoints for each chromo-
some on an HTML Web page with an SVG element that has the
PNG scatterplot as the background. After each change to the
annotated regions, the server updates the displayed model by
sending a JavaScript Object Notation ﬁle to the annotator’s
Web browser.

4.2 Data storage, export and server conﬁguration

To support interactive annotation and model updates,
SegAnnDB needs to store data in a fast database system. We
used Berkeley DB, as it allows quick storage and retrieval of any
data types. In addition, the disk space requirements are approxi-

Data can be exported to the UCSC genome browser by click-
ing a button on the SegAnnDB Web site. This sends the copy
number data, annotations and model directly from SegAnnDB
to the UCSC genome browser. Figure 2 explains the relationship
between the uploader, annotator, SegAnnDB server and UCSC
genome browser.

Conﬁguring the SegAnnDB software on a Debian/Ubuntu
GNU/Linux system requires Python and several free/open-
source extension packages. For example, the Pyramid Web
framework and the SegAnnot and PrunedDP segmentation mod-
ules are required. To avoid the time-consuming task of conﬁg-
uring all these packages for every new SegAnnDB server, we
made a public Amazon Machine Image, so launching a new
SegAnnDB server takes only 10min on Amazon’s Elastic
Compute Cloud. A list of current Amazon Machine Images
can be found in the SegAnnDB source code README on
INRIA GForge.

5 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

5.1 Supervised versus unsupervised analysis

In the machine learning literature, a learning problem is
‘supervised’ when there is a teacher or oracle that provides cor-
rect predictions for training an algorithm. In this article, the type
of supervision that we proposed is a set of annotated regions
from an expert’s visual interpretation of the data. These anno-
tated regions are then used by SegAnnDB to build a model with
consistent breakpoint locations and copy number calls.

In contrast, most statistical models for DNA copy number
analysis can be viewed as unsupervised because they do not
use an annotation database for model training. Typically, an
unsupervised statistical model is ﬁrst ﬁt to the data, and then
an expert plots the model to judge if it ﬁts the data well. This
sequence of steps is inverted on SegAnnDB: ﬁrst, we plot and
annotate the data, and then we ﬁt a model to the combined data
and annotations.

We considered the DNAcopy circular binary segmentation
model of Venkatraman and Olshen (2007) as an unsupervised
baseline model and compared its performance with SegAnnDB.
We analyzed speed, train error and test error with respect to
seven annotation datasets, consisting of 708 neuroblastoma,
lymphoma and medulloblastoma copy number proﬁles
(Supplementary Table S4). The data come from cell lines and
primary tumors (Supplementary Fig. S2) analyzed using different
platforms (Bacterial Artiﬁcial Chromosome (BAC)/Pl Artiﬁcial
Chromosome (PAC), Nimblegen, Affymetrix), so the number of
probes per proﬁle ranges from 1719 to l 868 857 (Supplementary
Table S3). In total, there were 4467 annotated chromosomes
containing 6937 annotated regions.

Supplementary Table S5 shows that the PrunedDP algorithm
used by SegAnnDB took <2h to train on the entire dataset, but
DNAcopy took >3h for each of the 31 parameter values we
tested. PrunedDP was faster overall because it was faster for
the high-density proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S3).

The displayed segmentation on SegAnnDB is always consist-
ent with the given breakpoint annotations, so SegAnnDB has
0% training error by deﬁnition (Section 3). In contrast, it may
be impossible to achieve zero annotation errors with an

unsupervised model that does not directly use the breakpoint
annotations (Hocking and Rigaill, 2012). Supplementary Table
S6 shows that the unsupervised dnacopy.default algorithm pre-
dicts 4—50% incorrect breakpoint annotations across the seven
datasets we examined. For a more balanced comparison,
Hocking et al. (2013) showed that DNAcopy breakpoint detec-
tion can be improved by picking an undo.SD parameter which
minimizes breakpoint annotation error (we did not apply
smoothing before segmentation, and we kept default values for
all other parameters). For each dataset, we picked chromosome-
speciﬁc undo.SD values, yielding better training error rates (Sup-
plementary Table S6, dnacopy.sd, 0.33—2.75%). Although break-
points detected by these methods are qualitatively similar
(Supplementary Fig. S4), SegAnnDB is quantitatively more ac-
curate with 0% error.

We also evaluated the test error by training a model on a set of
annotated chromosomes, and counting the number of incorrectly
predicted breakpoint annotations on a test set. Figure 4 and
Supplementary Figure S5 show that adding more annotations
improves the test error of the supervised SegAnnDB and
dnacopy.sd methods (dataset-speciﬁc parameters were chosen
by minimizing annotation error for each randomly chosen train-
ing set). Predictably, the supervised methods adapt to the pro-
vided annotations and detect breakpoints more accurately than
the unsupervised dnacopy.default algorithm. However, on some
high-density datasets, even the best methods showed up to 20—
40% test error (Supplementary Fig. S5). The large test error of
these supervised methods motivates spending time on interactive
annotation, which always achieves 0% training error.

SegAnnDB is a computer vision system that exploits the
strong points of the human visual system and mathematical
models. The human visual system is good at detecting noise
and breakpoints in the copy number signal over large regions,
but bad at detecting the precise location of a breakpoint.
Mathematical models are good at detecting the precise locations
of alterations, if tuning parameters are adjusted appropriately.
SegAnnDB combines the best of both approaches by automat-
ically adjusting the tuning parameters of a mathematical model
to agree with an expert’s visual annotations.

5.2 Time required for visual annotation on SegAnnDB

The amount of time is proportional to the number of annotated
regions that need to be added to correct the displayed model.
More breakpoint annotations are sometimes necessary for larger
proﬁles (Supplementary Fig. S6), but when SegAnnDB provides
good predictions in unannotated regions (Fig. 4), annotating all
breakpoints is not necessary (Supplementary Fig. S1). S0 in our
experience, it takes ~10 min to completely annotate even high-
density proﬁles, and it should be feasible to annotate each proﬁle
in datasets of a few dozen samples.

For larger datasets, it may not be feasible to annotate every
proﬁle. For example, visually annotating every proﬁle from the
1000 Genomes Project of Altshuler et a]. (2010) would require
~10 min/proﬁle x 1000 proﬁles/ (60 min/h) = 166 h, which is sev-
eral weeks of work. However, for large datasets, SegAnnDB can
still be useful for creating a relatively small database of 5—10
visually annotated proﬁles that are representative of the bigger
dataset (generated on the same platform and for the same tumor

type). Then the protocols of Hocking et a]. (2013) can be used for
training and validating an algorithm for automatically detecting
CNAs on the unannotated proﬁles. The main idea is that for
each manually annotated region, one can check whether an al-
gorithm predicts the indicated copy number or breakpoints in
that region. If there is some disagreement, then the algorithm
needs to be improved. So when there is not enough time to visu-
ally annotate every proﬁle, an annotated region database is still
useful for checking the validity of an automatic annotation
algorithm.

5.3 Correcting experimental artifacts

Supervised copy number analysis is useful for correcting the vari-
ous types of noise and artifacts that can be present in DNA copy
number proﬁles. In this section, we discuss three types of correc-
tions that can be easily visually annotated using SegAnnDB.
First, some proﬁles have noise patterns that should be ignored
and are easy to visually identify. Examples are wave patterns and
outliers, as shown in the left panel of Figure 5. If one of these
patterns can be visually identiﬁed, then SegAnnDB can be used
to exclude it by simply placing a Obreakpoints region around it.
Second, many copy number calling algorithms assume that the
baseline normal level of two copies should be centered around
log ratio 0, but this can depend on the normalization procedures.
For example, the center panel of Figure 5 shows a proﬁle whose
normal level appears at log ratio R505. When it is visually obvi-
ous that normal copy number is at a non-zero log ratio value,
then normal copy number regions can be used to indicate that.
Finally, many algorithms have a parameter for the minimal
number of probes required for identifying a CNA. For example,
by default DNAcopy sets its min.width parameter to two probes.
Instead of deﬁning an arbitrary value that may not hold for all
alterations in a dataset, breakpoint annotations can be used to
deﬁne small alterations that are visually obvious, such as the loss
shown in the right panel of Figure 5. Then, for example, the an-
notations can be used to check which values of the DNAcopy
min.width parameter are appropriate for a given dataset.

5.4 Using annotations in later analyses

The annotation database, segmentation and copy number calls
created on SegAnnDB can be used as inputs to other analyses.
SegAnnDB creates a list of breakpoints which is more accurate
than other methods such as DNAcopy (Supplementary Table S6),
and this degree of accuracy can be critical for several applications.

normal level at non~zero logratio

For example, to construct a genome alteration print, Popova
et a]. (2009) require a good segmentation algorithm: ‘the absence
of true breakpoints could signiﬁcantly alter the GAP pattern’.
Annotated regions can be used on SegAnnDB to ensure that the
segmentation contains all visible breakpoints.

As another example, the locations of detected alterations can
be used to construct predictors when modeling survival outcome.
SegAnnDB can be used to construct predictors that agree with
an expert’s visual interpretation of the data.

An important ﬁnal example is detecting recurrent alterations
in related samples, or excluding germ line alterations that also
appear in normal samples. There are two approaches: either the
model shown on SegAnnDB can be post-processed, or the anno-
tated regions created using SegAnnDB can be used to train and
validate another algorithm.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We described the usage and implementation of SegAnnDB, a
Web-based computer vision system for DNA copy number pro-
ﬁle analysis. SegAnnDB improves previous visualization
approaches by allowing the model to be interactively updated
using annotated regions. In contrast with other mathematical
models in the literature, SegAnnDB has no tuning parameters,
as they are selected automatically using the provided annota-
tions. Overall, SegAnnDB is a useful research tool that provides
accurate annotation of copy number proﬁles, facilitates inter-
action between biologists and bioinformaticians, and allows visu-
alization of several copy number proﬁles simultaneously.

Annotated regions can be added on SegAnnDB until the dis-
played model is consistent with an expert’s visual interpretation
of a copy number proﬁle. In other words, an expert with enough
time can always ﬁnd a consistent model by adding annotations,
as our model always has zero training error with respect to the
annotated regions.

However, predicting accurate breakpoints for unannotated
test data was difﬁcult for the models we considered
(Supplementary Fig. S5). Developing models that can more
quickly achieve better breakpoint detection and copy number
calling in unannotated test data remains an interesting research
direction. Although different experts do not always provide con-
sistent annotations (Supplementary Fig. S7), we are also investi-
gating a multitask learning model that could potentially have
better prediction accuracy for each of those experts.

One current feature of SegAnnDB is the ability to plot
a random unannotated chromosome. Instead of plotting a
random proﬁle, we could plot a proﬁle that is likely to improve
model predictions. We are interested in future research
into sampling methods that improve the model faster than
random sampling in DNA copy number proﬁle annotation
databases.

Finally, we are interested in using visual annotations for mod-
eling copy number changes in next-generation sequencing data.
In particular, Teo et al. (2012) show ﬁgures with clear break-
points in read depth and fragment count. Boeva et al. (2012)
show plots with clear breakpoints in copy number and B allele
frequency. These breakpoints can be visually annotated and
saved to a database to ensure that they are respected by any
trained models.

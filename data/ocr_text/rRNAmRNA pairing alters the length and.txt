ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ribosome profiling is a new technique that allows moni-
toring locations of translating ribosomes on mRNA at a whole tran-
scriptome level. A recent ribosome profiling study demonstrated that
internal Shine—Dalgarno (SD) sequences have a major global effect on
translation rates in bacteria: ribosomes pause at SD sites in mRNA.
Therefore, it is important to understand how SD sites effect mRNA
movement through the ribosome and generation of ribosome
footprints.

Results: Here, we provide evidence that in addition to pausing effect,
internal SD sequences induce a caterpillar-like movement of mRNA
through the ribosome cavity. Once an SD site binds to the ribosome,
it remains attached to it while the ribosome decodes a few subsequent
codons. This leads to asymmetric progressive elongation of ribosome
footprints at the 3/-end. It is likely that internal SD sequences induce
a pause not on a single, but on several adjacent codons. This finding
is important for our understanding of mRNA movement through
the ribosome and also should facilitate interpretation of ribosome
profiling data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Translation initiation sites in bacteria usually consist of a start
codon (most frequently AUG, GUG or UUG) and a purine
reach region 6—10 nt upstream, termed a Shine—Dalgarno (SD)
sequence (Shine and Dalgarno, 1975). The SD sequence binds to
the small ribosomal subunit through complementary interactions
with an anti-Shine—Dalgarno (aSD) sequence located at the 3’-
end of 16S rRNA (3’-AUUCCUCCAC). The importance of SD
sequences for translation initiation is well known; its presence is
routinely veriﬁed in algorithms for start codon prediction in bac-
teria (Borodovsky and Lomsadze, 2011; Hyatt et al., 2010).
Until recently, the known role of internal SD sequences was
limited to its stimulatory effect on ribosomal frameshifting in -
bacteria (Larsen et al., 1994; Weiss et al., 1987, 1988). Recent
single-molecule studies revealed that internal SD sites can arrest
ribosome movement along mRNA Given et al., 2008).
Application of the ribosome proﬁling technique (Ingolia et al.,

2009) to the analysis of protein synthesis in bacteria demon-
strated that this effect is pervasive (Li et al., 2012). It was
shown that ribosome density is positively correlated with the
presence of strong SD sequences, and strong SD—aSD inter-
actions cause pausing of elongating ribosomes. Under conditions
of fast growth, the SD site effect on translation rates seems to be
more signiﬁcant than that of other known coding sequence fea-
tures, such as codon bias (Li et al., 2012).

However, the pausing effect of SD sequences on elongating
ribosomes cannot explain all the empirical observations regard-
ing its stimulation of ribosomal frameshifting. Indeed the effect
of an SD site on frameshifting is strictly determined by its
position relative to the frameshift site. For stimulation of +1
ribosomal frameshifting, an SD site needs to be located just
3 nt upstream of the P-site codon (Devaraj and Fredrick, 2010;
Weiss et al., 1987), whereas stimulation of —l frameshifting
requires a distance of 10—l4nt (Larsen et al., 1994). In bacter-
ial release factor 2 gene, which has a programmed frameshift
site, not only the SD site but also its distance from the frame-
shift site is highly conserved (Baranov et al., 2002). In addition
to interference with a tRNA in the E-site (Marquez et al.,
2004), the position speciﬁcity of SD site effect on frameshifting
could be due to tensions imposed on the bulk of mRNA
located between the decoding center and an SDzaSD duplex.
A simple analogy for such tensions is a “spring effect’ illu-
strated on Figure 1A. A short spacer is expected to produce
‘a stretched spring effect’ promoting a movement of codons in
the 5’ direction relative to tRNAs (tRNAs move forward). A
long spacer is expected to produce the opposite “compressed
spring effect’. The model illustrated in Figure 1A requires SD
site to be able to interact with aSD at a range of distances
from the decoded codon. Such interactions would force
mRNA to move through a ribosome in a caterpillar-like rip-
pling fashion. This could occur only if ribosomes are capable
of accommodating variable amount of mRNA between the
SDzaSD duplex and the decoding center. In this case, ribo-
somes would remain bound to the same SD site while decoding
several subsequent codons leading to asymmetric progressive
extension of ribosome footprints as shown in Figure 1B.

In this work, we analyzed ribosome proﬁling data obtained for
Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis and have shown that the
length and distribution of ribosome footprints at SD site-con-
taining mRNA regions is consistent with ‘the caterpillar model’
of progressive footprint extension.

(C) Density of footprint ends (both 5’ and 3’) relative to SD site (see
Section 2) for footprints of different lengths. It can be seen that the
location of the 5’ peak remains unchanged, whereas the location of the
3’ peak depends on the length of footprints. (D) The experimental ribo-
some proﬁling data at pause sites match a model of progressive extension
of footprints length. Ribosome density in the area of an SD site as
estimated with the 5’ - (red) and the 3’ -ends (blue). The plot in the
center was constructed using E.c0[i experimental data. The plot on the
left is a result of a model where SD site induces a pause on a single codon,
and footprint extensions are uniform at both ends. The plot on the right
corresponds to a model where SD site induces a pause at three adjacent
codons, resulting in asymmetrical extension of footprints relative to the
P-site codons. The latter model better reﬂects the distribution obtained
from the experimental data

2 METHODS

All ribosome proﬁling data are from (Li et al., 2012). The footprint
sequences were aligned to the organisms” reference genomes,
NC_000964.3 for B.Subtilis and NC_000913.2 for E.c0[i. The reads
were aligned allowing for two mismatches. Reads not aligning to a
unique location were discarded. To ensure that footprints correspond
to elongating and not initiating ribosomes, the only footprints used
were those that align downstream of the ﬁrst 30 nt, but upstream of the
last 75 nt of coding ORFs. An SD site was deﬁned as an octamer that
is predicted to form a duplex with the aSD (5’ -CACCUCCU-3’ ) with
free energy (AG) <8 kcal/mol. AG was calculated as in (Li et al., 2012)
using RNASubopt tool from Vienna RNA package (Gruber et al., 2008).
We found 1206 such SD sites in 704 genes from B.Subtilis and 1213 in 809

Fig. 2. SD-containing footprints have increased length. (A) Length dis-
tribution of footprints (RPFs, ribosome-protected fragments) containing
strong SD sequences (red) and containing no SD (blue) for E.c0[i (top)
and B.Subtilis (bottom). The difference between distributions is statistic-
ally signiﬁcant; Wilcoxon rank-sum test P<2.2e—16 in both cases.
(B) Correlation between the strength of a hexamer SDzaSD duplex and
the length of footprints. (C) Correlation between density of ribosomes on
mRNA and the length of footprints

genes from E.c0[i. Of 21596339 reads aligning the genes containing
strong SD sites, 1486956 were found to interact with SD sites (6—fold
increase over expected number). For E.c0[i, 1 668 187 reads were found to
interact with SD of 56389881 reads (3-fold increase over the expected
value).

The ﬁrst nucleotide of the octamer was considered as the ﬁrst nucleo-
tide of SD site irrespective of whether it forms a base pair with aSD, e.g.
the C in 5’ -CGGAGGUG—3’ is considered as the ﬁrst nucleotide of
the SD site.

Distributions of footprint lengths (Fig. 2) were obtained for the 2122
genes of E.coli and 1468 in B.Subtilis that had an average density >10
footprints per codon. To avoid unequal effects from differentially
expressed genes and pause sites, the frequency of footprint occurrence
of a particular length l was calculated as follows:

 

1 X1, Lk

rm ;M;;MM m
where x”), is the number of footprints in SD j of gene k and NJ- is a
number of SDs in a gene j. Essentially, distributions for ‘No SD’ foot-
prints were normalized on a per gene basis, whereas distributions for ‘SD’
footprints were normalized on a per SD basis. SD-containing footprints
were deﬁned as those that have an SD site within the 3rd and 17th nt
from the 5’ -end of a footprint. ‘No SD’ footprints were deﬁned as those
that do not have an octamer that can form a duplex with aSD at AG
52 kcal/mol within the same region of a footprint. The signiﬁcance of the
difference between the two distributions in Figure 2A was estimated using
the Wilcoxon rank-sum test.

The correlation analysis determined both the average normalized
density and average length of fragments whose 5’ -end is between 8 and
2nt upstream for each hexanucleotide sequence (Fig. 2B and C).
Similar to aforementioned data, this analysis was carried out for genes
with average density >10 footprints per codon. To reduce statistical
noise, the plots include data points whose averages were obtained from
at least 10 values.

For the plots in Figure 1D, the B.Subtilis footprints were mapped
to the genome, and all internal SD site locations were identiﬁed
using the criteria described in the ﬁrst paragraph of this section.
Only the regions containing SD sites (50 nt upstream and down-
stream of the ﬁrst nucleotide in an SD site) with the average footprint
density >1 per codon were used. The densities of the 5’ - and 3’ -ends

of the footprints aggregated across all SD sites were calculated as

dc) — N; Xi (2)
where d(s) is the density of footprint ends at s coordinate relative to SD,
e.g. s=1 for the ﬁrst nucleotide of an SD site. ij is the number of
footprint ends at the position s for SD site i; X ,- is the average number
of footprints per nucleotide in the region of SD site i; and N is the total
number of the SD sites used in the analysis. The plot in Figure 1C was
generated in the same way, but separately for the footprints of the dif-
ferent lengths, i.e. in the Equation (2), both x and X values refer to the
footprints of a particular length.

To simulate ribosomal proﬁling data in silico, 1000 random 1000-nt
long sequences were generated. SD site positions on each sequence were
determined based of free energy of the corresponding SDzaSD complex as
described earlier in the text. A series of 600 footprints were generated for
each sequence. Footprints were generated of a varied length (20—47 nt)
with their centers corresponding to P-site codon locations. The distribu-
tion of footprint lengths was modeled based on an empirical distribution
(Fig. 2A) of footprint lengths obtained from the experimental data. P-site
codon locations of ribosomes were chosen randomly with equal probabil-
ity P,- = P for rapidly translated codons at coordinates i and PX = 9P for a
slowly translated codons at coordinates x. The slowly translated codons
were deﬁned as those whose coordinates are located 11 nt downstream of
an SD. To model SD site-dependent extension of footprint lengths, foot-
prints were generated under a similar model with two alterations. First,
to distribute the pause over three adjacent codons, the probability of
P-site codon locations were set at Px=Px + 3=Px + 6:3P. Second,
to model asymmetric extension, footprint lengths were extended at their
5’ -end for P-site codon locations at x + 1 to x + 6 by the distance between
the P-site and x.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

‘The caterpillar model’ of SD-mediated footprint elongation is
shown in Figure 1B. The tight association of an SDzaSD duplex
could make disruption of SDzaSD duplex more energetically ex-
pensive than incorporation and folding of extra mRNA into the
cavity between ribosome subunits, thus allowing for increased
spacer distance between SD site and the codon in the P-site. In
this scenario, footprints containing internal SD sequences in
close proximity to their 5’-ends would be expected to be longer
on average than footprints lacking these sequences (Fig. 1B). To
ascertain whether this is the case, we compared the length of
ribosome footprints obtained by (Li et al., 2012) at locations
with strong internal SD sites with those that found at non-SD
sites (Fig. 2), see Section 2. The distribution of footprints derived
from sequences not containing an SD site is skewed to the right.
On average, the length of ribosome footprints without an SD site
is close to the lower boundary of the distribution. By contrast,
the distribution of SD-containing footprints is shifted toward
longer footprints and seems more symmetric, suggesting that
on average SD-containing footprints are longer, as expected
from the model in Figure 1. Moreover, there is a correlation
between footprint length and strength of the SDzaSD complex
(Fig. 2B). The correlation is not strong (r = 0.58 for B.subtilis and
r=0.53 for E.c0li) because of the large length variance of foot-
prints not containing SD sequences (Fig. 1). However, we
observed a consistent trend toward an increase in the average
footprint length at stronger SD sites. If ribosome pausing and
footprint elongation are both the effects of SD sequences, then a

correlation between ribosome density and the length of foot-
prints should exist. Indeed a strong correlation is observed
(Fig. 2B), r: 0.80 for B.subtilis and r=0.7l for E.c0li. The cor-
relation is nearly as strong as the correlation observed between
ribosome density and the strength of SDzaSD duplex, r = 0.86 (Li
et al., 2012) and is stronger than correlation between strength of
SDzaSD and the length of ribosome footprints. This raises a
question regarding existence of an additional link between the
length of footprints and ribosome pausing.

To investigate directionality of footprint extensions, we ana-
lyzed aggregated density of both 3’ and 5’ footprint ends relative
to SD site position for the footprints of individual lengths.
Figure 1C shows these distributions for footprints obtained
from ribosome proﬁling experiments in B.subtilis footprints.
Two distinct peaks can be observed for each footprint length,
the left peak contains predominantly 5’—ends, whereas the right
peak contains predominantly 3’-ends. It is clear that irrespective
of the footprint length, 5’-end locations remain unchanged.
At the same time, 3’-end locations shift downstream as the
length of footprints increases. Therefore, SD site containing foot-
prints are extended unidirectionaly at the 3’-ends as expected
from the model in Figure 1.

To verify this observation, we designed two in silico models of
ribosome pauses (see Section 2). The ﬁrst model assumes that
footprints are equally variable at both sides of a P-site codon
with SD site inducing a pause at a single codon. The second
model assumes that footprints at SD sites could be extended at
their 3’-ends, allowing slow translation for three codons. Under
the ﬁrst model, similar distributions of the density would be
observed for both 5’ and 3’ footprint ends with their means
separated by the average length of footprints (Fig. 1D, left).
In the second model, a dip can be seen shortly downstream
from the 5’-end peak; also the 3’-end peak is wider than the
5’-end peak (Fig. 1D, right). The distribution of experimentally
obtained footprints matches the behavior of the second model
more closely (Fig. 1D, center).

Since the development of the ribosome proﬁling technique
(Ingolia et al., 2009), it has become commonly accepted that
ribosome density is a direct measure of translation kinetics, e.g.
a high density of ribosome footprints indicates slowly decoded
mRNA locations (Ingolia et al., 2011; Stadler and Fire, 2011).
However, as we demonstrate here, the footprint extensions are
sequence dependent and are not equivalent at the 5’- and 3’-ends.
This implies that a precise position of the A-site codon in a
footprint could also be variable in a sequence-dependent
manner. It is possible that the length of footprints in eukaryotes
may also vary because of potential interactions between mRNA
and components of the ribosome. However, if they can happen,
it is unlikely that such variations in eukaryotes are as pervasive
as in bacteria as evidenced from the sharp triplet periodicity ob-
tained in eukaryotic systems (Guo et al., 2010; Ingolia et al.,
2009). The strength of triplet periodicity obtained from align-
ments of footprint 5’-ends is sufﬁcient to permit detection of
translated frames and switches between them (Michel et al.,
2012). This suggests that unlike in bacteria, the distance between
the A-site and the 5’-end of eukaryotic ribosome footprints is
predominantly uniform. However, if site-speciﬁc footprint
length variations occur in eukaryotes on speciﬁc sequences, it
would affect ribosome proﬁles of individual mRNAs.

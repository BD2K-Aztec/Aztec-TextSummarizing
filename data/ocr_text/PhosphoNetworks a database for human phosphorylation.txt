ABSTRACT

Summary: Phosphorylation plays an important role in cellular signal
transduction. Current phosphorylation-related databases often focus
on the phosphorylation sites, which are mainly determined by mass
spectrometry. Here, we present PhosphoNetworks, a phosphorylation
database built on a high-resolution map of phosphorylation networks.
This high-resolution map of phosphorylation networks provides not
only the kinase—substrate relationships (KSRs), but also the specific
phosphorylation sites on which the kinases act on the substrates. The
database contains the most comprehensive dataset for KSRs, includ-
ing the relationships from a recent high-throughput project for identi-
fication of KSR3 using protein microarrays, as well as known KSRs
curated from the literature. In addition, the database also includes
several analytical tools for dissecting phosphorylation networks.
PhosphoNetworks is expected to play a prominent role in proteomics
and phosphorylation-related disease research.

1 INTRODUCTION

The reversible phosphorylation of proteins regulates many as-
pects of cellular physiology. Abnormal phosphorylation is
known to be both a cause and a consequence of many diseases,
such as cancer, diabetes, heat attack, hypertension and rheuma-
toid arthritis (Cohen, 2001). The systematic study of phosphor-
ylation can greatly beneﬁt disease-related biomedical research. In
a recent project, we developed a combined protein microarray
and bioinformatics approach to identify kinase—substrate rela-
tionships (KSRs) in a high-throughout manner (Hu et al.,
2013; Newman et al., 2013). Based on the results of these studies,
we experimentally identiﬁed substrates for 289 unique kinases,
resulting in 3656 high-quality KSRs. The study generated more
human KSRs than all previous studies combined. To facilitate
the use of this information, we created the ‘Database for a High-
Resolution Map of Human Phosphorylation Networks
(PhosphoNetworks)’, an integrated information system for the

storage, retrieval, visualization and analysis of human phosphor-
ylation data. To enhance the discovery of phosphorylation rela-
tionships between kinases and their downstream substrates, we
also connected the kinases with the speciﬁc phosphorylation site
on substrate protein sequences, which will help users design mu-
tagenesis experiments of phosphorylation sites to block the phos-
phorylation event. Therefore, the PhosphoNetworks database
provides not only a powerful information resource but also an
integrated analysis platform.

2 DATABASE CONTENT

PhosphoNetworks currently covers KSRs at different levels. First, it con-
tains 24 046 in vitro KSRs (rawKSRs) identiﬁed by protein microarray.
Such relationships reﬂect biochemical reactions between kinases and their
substrates. On the next level, the database includes 3656 reﬁned, high-
conﬁdence, physiologically relevant KSRs (refKSRs), which are ﬁltered
by a series of criteria to enrich for KSRs that are likely to occur in cells.
The quality of the KSRs was extensively validated by independent trans-
fected cell experiments (Newman et al., 2013). Finally, 744 literature-
curated KSRs were integrated with the 3656 refKSRs to generate a com-
bined data set (comKSR). Besides the KSRs, the database also includes
300 predicted consensus phosphorylation motifs for 284 human kinases
(~55% of human kinome). For dual-speciﬁcity kinases, which phosphor-
ylate both serine/threonine and tyrosine residues, two types of motifs are
predicted. The quality of these predicted motifs was supported by the
comparisons with motifs from other sources, such as positional scanning
peptide libraries or other computational methods (Hutti et al., 2004; Mok
et al., 2010; Newman et al., 2013).

To create a high-resolution map of KSRs, we further integrated the
300 consensus phosphorylation motifs and phosphorylation sites deter-
mined by mass spectrometry (MS/MS) on substrates of each kinase.
Using a computational approach, we connected 230 kinases with 2591
phosphorylation sites on 652 substrate proteins.

A summary of PhosphoNetworks content is shown in Table 1, and all
data are freely available for all academic users from our Web site (http://
phosphonetworks.org/downloadhtml).

3 DATABASE USAGE AND ACCESS

PhosphoNetworks is composed of four major functional mod-
ules, namely ProteinSearch, Site Search, PathSearch and
NetworkSearch.

ProteinSearch provides detailed information about a query
protein. The information includes the list of upstream kinases
that phosphorylate the query protein as well as the MS/MS-
veriﬁed phosphorylation sites in the query protein. If the query
protein is a kinase, PhosphoNetworks also provides the list of
downstream substrates and the phosphorylation motif recog-
nized by the query protein. Left clicking the mouse on the
motif logo image will open another web page listing the
15mers surrounding the phosphorylated site that constitute
the Position Weight Matrix (PWM) of the motif. In addition,
the speciﬁc phosphorylation sites on its substrate proteins are
also provided. ProteinSearch accepts both the ofﬁcial gene
symbol names and aliases as the query input.

SiteSearch allows the user to search the MS/MS-veriﬁed phos-
phorylation sites in a query protein. In some cases, it will also
provide putative upstream kinase(s) that act on the phosphoryl-
ation site(s). To search MS/MS-veriﬁed phosphorylation sites,
we use Perl regular expression to ﬁnd the hits from 70422
collected MS/MS-veriﬁed phosphorylation peptides. To predict
putative upstream kinases, we scan all possible phosphorylation
sites containing serine, threonine and tyrosine amino acids, score
them by PWM of all kinases, and then compare the scores with
the cutoffs computed from the human proteome. All sites with
scores larger than the cutoff are deﬁned as predicted phosphor-
ylation sites, and its upstream kinase is deﬁned as the one rep-
resented by the PWM.

PathSearch enables the user to do pathway analysis between a
pair of proteins. Given two protein names as input, PathSearch
will ﬁnd the shortest phosphorylation path between them. If
more than one shortest path exists, all of them will be provided.
This function has been shown to be useful in ﬁnding the missing
links in known, but incomplete, signaling pathways. For
example, we have successfully used this approach to ﬁnd the
intermediate serine/threonine kinase PRKACA that connects a
tyrosine kinase, Bruton’s tyrosine kinase, and ARID3A, a pro-
tein known to be inﬂuean by Bruton’s tyrosine kinase but
without known tyrosine phosphorylation site in it (Newman
et al., 2013).

NetworkSearch allows the user to perform network analysis
by querying a set of proteins. Given a group of protein names as
input, NetworkSearch will ﬁnd all direct neighbors of these pro-
teins and show the network composed by them in a scalable
vector graphics (SVG) ﬁgure. The template of NetworkSearch
is based on our previous MoReNet database (Hu et al., 2010). It
allows users to drag and move nodes in the network to get a
better topology. The users are also allowed to download gene
and gene pairs in the network in plain text format.

4 DISCUSSIONS

PhosphoNetworks database integrates two kinds of high-
throughput phosphorylation data, protein microarray-veriﬁed
KSRs and MS-veriﬁed phosphorylation sites. Relative to
other human phosphorylation-related databases, such as
Phospho.ELM (http://phospho.elm.eu.org/) (Dinkel et al.,
2011), PhosphoNetworks has three signiﬁcant merits. First, it
is a high-resolution phosphorylation network database, which
connects kinases not only to their downstream substrates but
also at speciﬁc phosphorylation sites on the substrates. Second,
it covers a far greater number of novel identiﬁed KSRs (24 046
raw KSRs and 3656 reﬁned KSRs) and novel predicted phos-
phorylation motifs (300 motifs, over double that of the previous
knowledgebase). Finally, it provides some unique tools to make
it easier for the user to explore and analyze the data. For
example, the PathSearch function allows the user to ﬁnd the
missing link in known incomplete pathways, and the
SiteSearch function allows the user to predict possible upstream
kinases of their interested proteins or peptides. We expect this
database will be valuable for proteomics and phosphorylation-
related disease research.

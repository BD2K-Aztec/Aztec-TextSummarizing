ABSTRACT

Summary: The Network Ontology Analysis (NOA) plugin for
Cytoscape implements the NOA algorithm for network-based enrich-
ment analysis, which extends Gene Ontology annotations to network
links, or edges. The plugin facilitates the annotation and analysis of
one or more networks in Cytoscape according to user-defined param-
eters. In addition to tables, the NOA plugin also presents results in the
form of heatmaps and overview networks in Cytoscape, which can be
exported for publication figures.

Availability: The NOA plugin is an open source, Java program for
Cytoscape version 2.8 available via the Cytoscape App Store (http://
apps.cytoscape.org/apps/noa) and plugin manager. A detailed user
manual is available at http://nrnb.0rg/tools/noa.

1 INTRODUCTION

To make use of the vast wealth of data and knowledge to eluci-
date the function of biological networks is one of the biggest
challenges in bioinformatics. The development of high-through-
put technology has given rise to an enormous increase of data on
biomolecular expression and interactions, which results in pro-
tein interaction networks, gene regulatory networks, signaling
networks and metabolic networks. One approach to understand-
ing networks relies on ontologies, such as Gene Ontology (GO),
and enrichment analysis. Common approaches, such as BiNGO
(Maere et al., 2005), regard a network as a list of genes, perform-
ing gene-level annotation and enrichment methods. However, it
is apparent that the same list of genes with different interactions
may perform different functions. Thus, the functional analysis of
networks should take into consideration network topology.
Our previous work introduced the Network Ontology
Analysis (NOA) algorithm to perform gene ontology enrichment
analysis on biological networks Wang et al., 2011). First, NOA
assigns ontology terms to interactions based on the known an-
notations of connected genes via optimizing two novel indexes

‘Coverage’ and ‘Diversity’. Then, NOA generates two alternative
reference sets to statistically rank the enriched functional terms
for a given biological network. NOA was shown to be more
efﬁcient not only for dynamic regulatory networks but also for
rewired protein interaction networks. However, there are several
shortcomings with the initial implementation: no graphical inter-
face or visualization of results; limited support for species, gene
names and ontology types; no batch mode for large-scale
computation; and no integration or interoperability with other
network tools. To overcome these shortcomings, we have reim-
plemented the NOA algorithm as a Cytoscape plugin and
added interfaces, extensible ontology and identiﬁer support,
new visualizations, a batch mode and interoperability with
other Cytoscape plugins, as demonstrated with CyThesaurus
(van Iersel et al., 2010) and Mosaic (Zhang et al., 2012).

2 METHODS

2.1 Algorithms

The original NOA algorithm was described in Wang et al., 2011). In the
NOA plugin, we have enhanced the network annotation algorithm to in-
clude standard statistical enrichment methods (e. g. hypergeometric distri-
bution, Fisher’s exact test and Z-score). We also added the option of
running a conventional node-based analysis (i.e. gene set enrichment), to
complement the edge-based approach. Several widely used correction
methods have been used to control the type I error rate of multiple hypoth-
eses testing, such as Bonferroni and Benjiamini & Hochberg methods.
Taking advantage of data model and interoperability within Cytoscape,
users can perform NOA analysis on any network opened in Cytoscape
or any subnetwork, selected manually, by built-in ﬁltering mechanisms, or
even by another plugin. The NOA plugin also has multiple options for
reference networks based on the selected algorithm and test network.

2.2 Batch mode

Batch mode is another unique feature of the NOA plugin, allowing for
the simultaneous analysis of multiple networks. Batch mode recognizes
network and gene set ﬁle formats and selects an appropriate algorithm
(edge-based or node-based) accordingly. In the case of edge-based
analysis, each network is analyzed with respect to the combination of
all input networks or their derived clique (connecting all nodes). Node-
based analysis uses either the combination of all input genes or a given
genome as reference.

In batch mode, the primary output is a ranked list of GO terms
signiﬁcantly overrepresented for each network based on the selected
algorithm. The result list is displayed as an annotated table, including
GO term type, P value, description and associated nodes/edges.

NOA

 

An additional table displays the list of GO terms enriched in multiple
networks in the batch. The plugin also generates a sorted heatmap show-
ing the most signiﬁcantly enriched GO terms against all input networks.
These tables and heatmap can be exported to third-party tools for custom
visualization and analysis.

2.3 Single mode

In single mode, the NOA plugin can analyze any network in Cytoscape.
For edge-based analysis, the clique form of the selected network is used as
reference by default. If the user selects a subnetwork for analysis, then
they also have the option of using the original parent network as refer-
ence. In the case of node-based analysis, the corresponding genome is
used as reference, or the complete gene set from a given network if only a
subset is selected for analysis.

The results include a ranked and annotated list of GO terms, similar
to batch mode. And, unique to single mode, an overview network is gen-
erated with signiﬁcant GO terms represented as nodes. The size of these
nodes is based on the number of occurrences of a given GO term annota-
tion on the edges (or nodes) of the analyzed network. The co-occurrence of
any two GO terms is represented by edges in the overview network.

3 DISCUSSION

The following use cases demonstrate the analysis options avail-
able in the NOA plugin and the types of the results users should
expect.

3.1 Human pathways

We prepared a ﬁle containing all the human pathways curated at
WikiPathways (Kelder et al., 2012) and translated Ensembl iden-
tiﬁers for batch mode analysis by the NOA plugin
(Supplementary File S1). We ran edge-based analysis to make

use of the interaction content in the pathways, rather than just
treating them like disconnected gene sets. Each pathway was
analyzed against the entire collection as reference and no correc-
tion was applied. As expected, curated pathways of known func-
tion were signiﬁcantly annotated with relevant GO terms (Fig. 1
and Supplementary Fig. S2). Users could add novel pathways or
interaction networks to this batch analysis to assess functional
annotation of edges in the context of known biology.

3.2 Human diseases

We collected protein interaction networks for different types of
genetic diseases constructed using a generic protein—protein
interactome as the source of disease gene interactions (\Nang
et al., 2009) (Supplementary File S3). We compared edge-based
and node-based analyses using the NOA plugin in batch mode.
The ranked and annotated lists of enriched GO terms in
Supplementary Tables S4 and S5 show many disease-term pair-
ings in common, not surprisingly, but also a few differences.
Signiﬁcantly, the inclusion of generic (not disease-speciﬁc) inter-
actions did not lead to less speciﬁc or aberrant GO terms with
the edge-based method. Thus, with the NOA plugin, users can
easily run both edge- and node-based analyses on gene sets of
interest, using interactome data to supply interactions.

3.3 Yeast cell cycle

We collected time-series microarray data on yeast cell cycle and
constructed regulatory transcription networks for each time
point using transcription factor-target pairs revealed by ChIP-
chip experiments (Supplementary File S6). Once again, we com-
pared both types of analysis and two types of reference networks
in batch analysis using the NOA plugin (Supplementary Fig. S7).

Edge-based analysis provided more speciﬁc GO terms than
node-based and reﬂected the known biological processes. We
also noted that the all-network reference produced better results
(i.e. more dynamic range and in line with known biology) than
the clique-based reference. When working with densely con-
nected networks, like in this example, users will typically produce
better results using the all-network option as reference.

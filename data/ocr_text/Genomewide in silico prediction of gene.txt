ABSTRACT

Motivation: Modelling the regulation of gene expression can provide
insight into the regulatory roles of individual transcription factors (T Fs)
and histone modifications. Recently, Ouyang et al. in 2009 modelled
gene expression levels in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells using
in vivo ChIP-seq measurements of TF binding. ChIP-seq TF binding
data, however, are tissue-specific and relatively difficult to obtain. This
limits the applicability of gene expression models that rely on
ChIP-seq TF binding data.

Results: In this study, we build regression-based models that relate
gene expression to the binding of 12 different TFs, 7 histone modifi-
cations and chromatin accessibility (DNase I hypersensitivity) in two
different tissues. We find that expression models based on computa-
tionally predicted TF binding can achieve similar accuracy to those
using in vivo TF binding data and that including binding at weak sites is
critical for accurate prediction of gene expression. We also find that
incorporating histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility data
results in additional accuracy. Surprisingly, we find that models that
use no TF binding data at all, but only histone modification and chro-
matin accessibility data, can be as (or more) accurate than those
based on in vivo TF binding data.

1 INTRODUCTION

A key challenge in modern genomics is understanding the regu-
latory interactions that occur to control gene expression. We can
use predictive modelling techniques such as linear regression to
both determine the accuracy of our understanding of the mech-
anisms of the regulation of gene expression, and to interpret and
offer insight into the roles played by the various regulatory pro-
teins, RNAs and other factors.

Perhaps the most studied and best understood mechanism of
gene regulation is transcription factor (TF) binding. TFs charac-
teristically have sequence-speciﬁc DNA-binding preferences.
They typically bind sites that are short (5—15bp), and often de-
generate. Not surprisingly, na'1've computational approaches that
simply scan genomic sequence for matching sites are highly

prone to making false-positive predictions WVasserman and
Sandelin, 2004). In an attempt to overcome this, methods incor-
porating evolutionary information regarding the conservation of
each putative site such as BBLS Oﬁe et al., 2009) have been
proposed. In reality, however, most researchers aim to make
tissue-, cell- or condition-speciﬁc (hereafter ‘tissue-speciﬁc’) in-
ferences regarding gene regulation, which evolutionary informa-
tion alone cannot provide.

Histones are subject to many different covalent post-
translational modiﬁcations such as methylation and acetylation.
These modiﬁcations can alter chromatin structure and function
and are known to comprise a tissue-speciﬁc histone ‘code’, read
by proteins to effect changes in gene regulation and expression
(van Ingen et al., 2008; Wang et al., 2008). Recently, global
chromatin-immunoprecipitation with massively parallel sequen-
cing (ChIP-seq) ‘maps’ of many histone modiﬁcations have
become available through the ENCODE (Rosenbloom et al.,
2010) and NIH Roadmap Epigenomics (Bernstein et al., 2010)
projects.

ChIP—seq is not just limited to interrogating histone state, but
also has become the gold-standard method for the genome-wide
prediction of tissue-speciﬁc TF-bound regulatory regions.
Unfortunately, however, TF ChIP—seq suffers from a major
drawback: only one TF (in a single tissue) may be analysed at
a time. It would be an extremely signiﬁcant endeavour to predict
the binding of the >139l known human sequence-speciﬁc TFs
Waquerizas et al., 2009) in one tissue or condition. As a result,
even large-scale projects to date have focused either on a small
number of TFs across several tissues (e.g. 10 TFs in
modENCODE; Gerstein et al., 2010), or on a larger number of
TFs in relatively few tissues (e. g. three primary tissues in
ENCODE; Rosenbloom et al., 2010). Additionally, determining
an appropriate cutoff for declaring putative binding sites is dif-
ﬁcult and has been the focus of substantial research (Chen et al.,
2008; Fejes et al., 2008; Valouev et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2008).

ChIP—seq TF binding data have previously been used to con-
struct a model of gene expression (Ouyang et al., 2009) in mouse
embryonic stem (mES) cells. They used ChIP—seq binding data
for 12 TFs that are known to contribute heavily to maintaining
pluripotency (Chen et al., 2008) and thus are considered key
factors regulating gene expression in ES cells. Ouyang et al.
(2009) performed linear regression, correlating binding by these
TFs with the expression of all genes and found that it could
explain 65% of the variation in gene expression in ES cells
(r: 0.81). This study did not consider the role of histone modi-
ﬁcations on expression, but Karlié et al. (2010) built a similar
regression model for human CD4 T+ cells, using histone

modiﬁcation data rather than TF binding data and also mana-
ged to explain a high degree of expression variance (r: 0.74).

In this study, we use TF binding, histone modiﬁcation and
chromatin accessibility data to address three major questions:
(i) can we accurately predict gene expression using in silico pre-
dictions of TF binding rather than in vivo binding data? (ii) Does
adding histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility data im-
prove the accuracy of predicted gene expression? (iii) Are weak
binding sites important to accurately predict gene expression?

To answer these questions, we derive log-linear regression-
based models that relate gene expression to the binding of 12
different TFs, to 7 histone modiﬁcations and to chromatin ac-
cessibility. We ﬁnd that expression models based on computa-
tionally predicted TF binding can achieve similar accuracy to
those using in vivo TF binding data and that including binding
at weak sites is critical for accurate prediction of gene expression.
We also ﬁnd that incorporating histone modiﬁcation and chro-
matin accessibility data results in additional accuracy.
Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that models that use no TF binding data
at all, but only histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility
data, are essentially as accurate as those based on in vivo TF
binding data.

2 METHODS

To predict gene expression, we build a log-linear regression model of gene
expression as a function of TF binding, histone modiﬁcations and chro-
matin accessibility. Each gene is represented as a vector of features, where
each feature represents either the predicted binding of a TF, the presence
of a histone modiﬁcation or the chromatin accessibility around the tran-
scription start site (TSS) of the gene. The model is ﬁt to the level of the
expression of each gene as measured by RNA-seq.

2.1 Predicting TF binding (TF afﬁnity scores)

For each TF—gene pair, we integrate either measured or predicted TF
binding around each gene promoter into a single TF afﬁnity score
(TFAS) using a weighted sum, where the weight decreases exponentially
as a function of distance from the TSS. Following the deﬁnition given by
Ouyang et al. (2009), we deﬁne the TFAS, Aij, for the ith gene and the jth
TF as the weighted sum over all predicted binding sites (k) as:

Aij = nge_dk/d°, (1)
k

where gk is the score of an individual predicted TF binding site. We
weight the contribution of each site to our integrated TFAS by the ex-
ponential decay term e‘dk/d", where dk is the distance in base pairs of the
putative binding site (k) from the TSS and do determines the decay rate.
Following Ouyang et al. (2009), we set do = 5000 for all TFs except E2f 1,
where we set do: 500 (Ouyang et al., 2009). We only include in this
weighted sum putative binding sites within 30 000 bp of the TSS, as the
weighted contributions of more distant sites are negligible. We evaluate
four methods for predicting individual binding sites and assigning indi-
vidual site scores (gk), which we discuss below. We then log transform
and quantile normalize the TFAS matrix A (Bolstad et al., 2003).

2.1.1 ChIP—seq site aﬁinity scores We use measured ChIP-seq
binding data for the 12 TFs from the Supplementary Material supplied
by Ouyang et al. (2009), which contains pre-calculated and normalized
TFASs, where gk is the height (in mapped tags) of each declared ChlP-seq
peak.

2.1.2 Non-tissue-specific in silico (position weight matrix) site
aﬂinity scores We perform a position weight matrix (PWM) scan of
the entire genome using FIMO (Grant et al., 2011). We use the default
options, which apply a P—value threshold of 10‘4 to predict matches and
a pseudocount of 0.1. For our binding site afﬁnity scores (gk), we use the
log-likelihood score of each predicted site reported by FIMO.

2.1.3 T issue-specific in silico (PWM +H3K4me3) site aﬁinity
scores As gene expression is tissue-speciﬁc, our third TF binding site
prediction method integrates tissue-speciﬁc epigenetic data with PWM
seaming. We use FIMO with a histone—based prior (Cuellar Partida
et al., 2012) using H3K4me3 data, as it has previously been shown to
be effective as a ﬁlter for predicting TF binding sites Whitington et al.,
2009). Using the tools published in Cuellar Partida et al. (2012), we create
a prior from the Mikkelsen et al. (2007) H3K4me3 data. We use param-
eters ,8 = 1 and or = 4 x 105. We scan the genome using this prior and the
default FIMO settings. For our site afﬁnity scores (gk), we use the
log-posterior ratio scores reported by FIMO.

2.2 Measuring histone modiﬁcations and chromatin
accessibility (histone and DNase scores)

We calculate histone modiﬁcation scores (histone scores) and chromatin
accessibility scores (DNase scores) for each histone modiﬁcation and for
DNase I hypersensitivity at the TSS of each gene. Taking a region :l:2000
bases relative to the TSS, we sum the number of mapped tags for each
histone modiﬁcation and for DNase (see Section 2.5). We deﬁne Zik for
gene i and histone modiﬁcation or DNase score k as:

2000
2,7, = Z TC(k, i, n), (2)
n=—2000
where TC(k, i, n) is the number of mapped sequence tags for histone
modiﬁcation or DNase I hypersensitivity k at position It relative to
gene is TSS. As we do above for the TFASs, we then log-transform
and quantile normalize the matrix Z (Bolstad et al., 2003).

2.3 Linear regression

We describe genome-wide gene expression by a log-linear model:

M H
log(Y,- + o) = ,u + Zﬁinj + 2 ijij + 61-, (3)
j=l j=1

where Y, is the expression level for gene i, ,u is the basal expression level,
Al]- is the jth TFAS for the ith gene and ,8]- is the ﬁtted coefﬁcient for the
jth TFAS. Similarly, Zij is the jth histone or DNase score for the ith gene
and yj the ﬁtted coefﬁcient for the jth histone modiﬁcation or DNase
score. 6,- is the gene—speciﬁc error term. a is a ﬁtted term to avoid taking
log(0); we ﬁt 0 using a held-out 20% of our data. To obtain conﬁdence
intervals, we bootstrap the regression 1000 times on the remaining 80%
of our data.

2.4 Linear regression with principal component analysis

We decompose a matrix, C, consisting of the column-wise concatenation
of our TFAS matrix, A and our histone and DNase score matrix, Z, using
the singular-value decomposition C: UEVT, as described in Ouyang
et al. (2009). We create the matrix X: U2, which is of the form X ,7,
where the columns are the principal components (PCs) and the rows
are genes.

Using this transformed data, we perform the regression,

M
mm + a) = u + Z 18ij + 6.. (4)

where Y, is the gene expression level, ,u represents basal expression, M is
the number of PCs, 6,- is a gene-speciﬁc error term and Bj is the ﬁtted
coefﬁcient for the jth PC. We ﬁt a as previously described. We bootstrap
the PC analysis (PCA) regression as previously described.

2.5 Data

2.5 .1 Mouse embryonic stem cells The TSS of genes is taken from
the gene annotation dataset for the mouse genome (mm8/NCBIM36.46)
from the Ensembl FTP server (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/). To exclude the
possibility that we include multiple transcripts or isoforms of the same
gene in our regression, we use the most 5’ -located TSS from the Ensembl
gene annotation data as each gene’s TSS. We also exclude all genes from
haplotype variants and unmapped contig regions. This, combined with
the removal of any genes with low conﬁdence RNA-seq mapping, leaves
a set of 18 008 genes for analysis.

Histone modiﬁcation ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K4me2,
H3K4me3, H3K9me3, H4K20me3, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 are
from Mikkelsen et al. (2007) and Meissner et al. (2008) pro-compiled
‘density’ ﬁles (similar to ‘wig’ ﬁles).

Raw DNase I hypersensitivity sequence tags are from Schnetz et al.
(2010), which we mapped using Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009).

We use TF ChIP-seq data for E2f1, Esrrb, Klf4, c-Myc, n-Myc,
Nanog, Oct4, Smadl, Sox2 and Stat3 from Chen et al. (2008).
Position weight matrices (PWMs) describing the DNA-binding prefer-
ences (motifs) for Esrrb, Klf4, c-Myc, n-Myc and Stat3 are taken from
Chen et al. (2008). For E2f1, Nanog and Smadl, we use PWMs from
UniProbe (Berger and Bulyk, 2009), JASPAR (Portales-Casamar et al.,
2010) and TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003), respectively. For Oct4 and
Sox2, for which Chen et al. (2008) reported a composite Oct-Sox motif,
we trimmed off the non-Oct and non-Sox portion from the Oct4 and
Sox2 motifs, respectively. For full details, please see the Supplementary
Material.

We use an extremely deep RNA-seq mouse expression dataset
(Cloonan et al., 2008), which was re—normalized in reads per kilobase
of exon per million tags (RKPM) by Ouyang et al. (2009). RKPM has
been previously shown to be proportional to mRNA abundance
(Mortazavi et al., 2008).

2.5.2 GM12878 cells The TSS of genes is taken from the gene
annotation dataset for the human genome (hg19/GRCh37) from the
Ensembl FTP server (ftp://ftp.ensembl.org/). To exclude the possibility
that we include multiple transcripts or isoforms of the same gene in our
regression, we use the most 5’ -located TSS from the Ensembl gene anno-
tation data as each gene’s TSS. We also exclude all genes from haplotype
variants and unmapped contig regions. This, combined with the removal
of any genes with low conﬁdence RNA-seq mapping, leaves a set of
37 458 genes for analysis.

Histone modiﬁcation ChIP-seq data for H3K4me1, H3K4me2,
H4K20me1, H3K27me3 and H3K36me3 are from the ENCODE project
‘bigWig’ ﬁles produced by the Broad laboratory (ENCODE, 2011).
H3K4me3 was remapped onto th9 from the ‘fastq’ ﬁle produced by
the Broad laboratory using BowTie (Langmead et al., 2009). Raw
DNase I hypersensitivity data are from the ‘signal’ bigWig ﬁle produced
by the Duke laboratory as part of the ENCODE project (ENCODE,
2011).

We use TF ChIP-seq data for c-Fos, thf, Egrl, Nrfl Nrsf, Pou2f2,
Spl, Srf, Stat3, Usfl and Yyl.

We also use an ENCODE-provided RNA-seq dataset for our
GM12878 gene expression data, which we mapped onto th9 and nor-
malized into RKPM using TopHat (Trapnell et al., 2009). Full details on
the sources of the RNA-seq data, ChIP-seq data and the PWMs are
provided in the Supplementary Material.

2.6 Implementation

We implement the log-linear regression models in R (R Development
Core Team, 2008). All R scripts, motifs and data (including expression
data, TFASs, histone and DNase scores) are available online at http://
researchimb.uq.edu.au/t.bailey/supplementary_data/McLeay201 1a/.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Using in silico TF binding predictions to model
gene expression

We ﬁrst explore whether in silico TF binding predictions can
replace ChIP-seq binding measurements. To do this, we build
models using only TF binding features and compare models of
gene expression based on TF ChIP-seq binding data with models
based on in silico TF binding estimates (Fig. la). As expected,
models using in vivo measurements of TF binding (ChIP-seq
TFAS) explain substantially more variance (adjusted
R2 = 0.644; Fig. la, bar 3) than models using either the non-tis-
sue-speciﬁc in silico (PWM) or tissue-speciﬁc in silico
(PWM + H3K4me3) afﬁnity scores. We ﬁnd that a model
using tissue-speciﬁc in silico TF binding predictions (PWM scan-
ning with a H3K4me3 prior) is much more predictive of expres-
sion than the non-tissue-speciﬁc in silico afﬁnity score model
(adjusted R220.521 and adjusted R2=O.279; Fig. la, bars 1
and 2, respectively), nearly doubling the explained variance.

We hypothesize that possibly one or more of the TFs are
poorly described by their PWM, hampering the performance of
our models that use in silico binding predictions. To explore this,
we take the ChIP-seq TFAS model and replace a single TF with
the equivalent tissue-speciﬁc in silico data. Replacing the single
E2f1 tissue-speciﬁc in silico TFAS with ChIP-seq E2f1 data
yields a model that is statistically indistinguishable from one
using all 12 ChIP-seq datasets (Fig. lb, top two bars.
R2 20.630 and R2 20.644, respectively, error bars overlap).
Replacing any other tissue-speciﬁc in silico TFAS with a
ChIP-seq TFAS has either minimal or no effect (Fig. lb, com-
pare bottom bar with others), with the exception of Sox2, where
its inclusion surprisingly decreases R2 (see Section 4). Thus, with
our in silico method and ChIP-seq data for one TF, we can
achieve indistinguishable accuracy to using 12 ChIP-seq datasets.

Having observed that E2f1 is the sole TF, where replacing
tissue-speciﬁc in silico E2f1 data with ChIP-seq TF data is sufﬁ-
cient to increase explained gene expression variance to be indis-
tinguishable from using 12 TF ChIP-seq datasets, we also
examine whether in an all ChIP-seq TFAS model, replacing
the E2f1 ChIP-seq data with in silico data decreases the accuracy
of the model. In our model using all ChIP-seq TFASs, we ﬁnd
that replacing any ChIP-seq TFAS except E2f1 with
PWM + H3K4me3 data has no statistically signiﬁcant effect on
model accuracy (Fig. lc, compare bottom bar with others).
Replacing E2fl ChIP-seq TFAS with the E2fl
PWM+H3K4me3 TFAS, however, causes a large decrease in
R2, suggesting that the tissue-speciﬁc in silico binding predictions
fail to completely capture the binding of E2f1. For any other TF
in the model, replacing ChIP-seq data with tissue-speciﬁc in silico
binding data causes no signiﬁcant decrease in accuracy.

When we regress each ChIP-seq TFAS alone against expres-
sion (‘Results’ section in the Supplementary Material; Fig. 3), we

ﬁnd that E2f1 is the most individually informative TF. It has
been suggested that E2f1 binds <20% of its binding sites directly
in human ES cells (Bieda et al., 2006). If this is the case,
PWM-based methods would therefore be unable to predict the
majority of E2f1 binding sites. Given the importance of E2f1 in
this model, it is not surprising that models including in silico E2f1
data are less predictive of gene expression.

3.2 A combination of histone modiﬁcation and DNase I
hypersensitivity data is as predictive of expression as
TF ChIP-seq data

Next, we examine whether integrating histone modiﬁcation data
and chromatin accessibility information (DNase) will improve
the predictive accuracy of both tissue-speciﬁc in silico TFAS
and ChIP-seq TFAS models of gene expression. We perform
log-linear regression using our 12 TF afﬁnity scores, both
alone and combined with histone modiﬁcation and chromatin
accessibility data. In Figure 2, we compare the descriptive
power (expressed as adjusted R2) of four models: ChIP-seq
TFAS only, tissue-speciﬁc in silico TFAS with histone modiﬁca-
tion and DNase data, ChIP-seq TFAS with histone modiﬁcation
and DNase data, and histone modiﬁcation and DNase data
alone (no TF binding data).

We ﬁnd that models that use no TF binding data at all are
surprisingly accurate. A model using just seven histone scores and
the DNase score (bar 2, Fig. 2) is as descriptive of gene expression
as the model using the ChIP-seq TF binding data for all 12 TFs
(bar 1, Fig. 2). There is no statistically signiﬁcant difference in the
accuracy of these two models (R2=O.624 cf. R2=O.644, 95%
conﬁdence intervals overlap). While it is well known that histone
modiﬁcations play key roles in mediating gene expression (Karlié
et al., 2010), it is still surprising that a model based on only these
seven histone modiﬁcations and chromatin accessibility, and not
on TF binding data, predicts expression almost as well as a model
using the 12 TFs known to be key regulators of gene expression
in pluripotent mES cells (Chen et al., 2008).

Next, we determine whether combining histone modiﬁcation
and chromatin accessibility data with our tissue-speciﬁc in silico
TF binding predictions improves predictive accuracy. We ﬁnd
that including incorporating histone modiﬁcation and chromatin
accessibility data with our tissue-speciﬁc in silico
(PWM + H3K4me3) method to be as effective as using
ChIP-seq TFAS data (R2: 0.649 and R2=0.644, Fig. 2, bars 3
and 1, respectively, error bars overlap). We also ﬁnd that our
PWM + H3K4me3 method with histone and DNase scores to be
more effective than only using histone modiﬁcation and DNase
data (R2 = 0.649 cf. R2 = 0.624, Fig. 2, bars 3 and 2, respectively,
error bars do not overlap).

(no) TFASs are based on tissue-speciﬁc in silico data

The ChIP-seq model consists of 12 TFASs, while the remaining three
models are histone and DNase scores only, tissue-speciﬁc PWM
GDWM + H3K4me3) TFAS with histone and DNase scores, and
ChIP-seq TFAS with histone and DNase scores, respectively

provides a signiﬁcant improvement to the regression ﬁt
(R2=O.695) over ChIP-seq TFAS alone. Both the histone and
DNase score only model, and the ChIP-seq TFAS only model,
are quite descriptive of gene expression. The improvement gained
by combining histone, DNase and TF binding data suggests that
there is additional information available in the histone and
DNase data that is not present in the TF ChIP-seq data.

3.3 Predicted expression correlates well with measured
expression

It is also informative to plot the predicted expression against the
actual RNA-seq expression data for our models (Fig. 3a—d) and
to calculate the Pearson correlation coefﬁcients (r). For several of
our methods (tissue-speciﬁc in silico TF predictions with histone
and DNase data; ChIP-seq TF data only; ChIP-seq TF data with
histone modiﬁcation and DNase data; histone modiﬁcation and
DNase data alone), we actually achieve higher correlation
between our predicted expression values and actual (RNA-seq)
expression values than that observed between RNA-seq and
microarray expression experiments in the same tissue (r: 0.734;
see the Supplementary Material to Ouyang et al., 2009).

The predicted and actual expression values are fairly well
correlated in the model that is based on ChIP-seq TF, histone
and DNase scores (Fig. 3c, r=0.834) and in the model t based
on tissue-speciﬁc in silico TF, histone and DNase scores (Fig. 3d,
r: 0.806). The correlation in the non-tissue-speciﬁc in silico
model (PWM, Fig. 3a). We ﬁnd only a relatively small difference
in accuracy between these models, both having predicted expres-
sion values that correlate well with actual expression.

3.4 Principal components provide information on TF and
histone roles

We then perform PCA using singular value decomposition of
TF, histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility (DNase)
data, decomposing a joint matrix (with TF, histone modiﬁcation
and DNase data as columns) into PCs (see Section 2.4). Using
these components rather than TFASs, and histone and DNase
scores directly, we perform log-linear regression. PCA allows the
extraction of a small number of non-correlated PCs responsible
for the majority of gene variance. We examine the role of each
TF, histone modiﬁcation and chromatin accessibility in the re-
gression. We plot the relative loading of each feature within the
most informative PC (PC2), weighted by the proportion of vari-
ance explained (adjusted R2) by that PC (Fig. 4).

We ﬁnd that the tissue-speciﬁc in silico TF PCA model is very
similar to the ChIP-seq TF PCA model at providing biological
information on the regulatory roles of the features, especially in
the most important PCs. Visually, a high degree of similarity
between the PCs is present, with only minor differences (com-
paring Fig. 4a and b). Both models show all TFs as positively
associated with transcription, with E2F 1, Klf4, fo, c-Myc and

Fig. 5. Proportion of GM12878 gene expression variance explained by
each model (adjusted R2). Each bar corresponds to the proportion of the
variance in RNA-seq gene expression levels explained by each model. Error
bars correspond to 95% conﬁdence intervals estimated via bootstrapping

n-Myc as the most weighted TFs. Likewise, the weighted loading
on each histone modiﬁcation is qualitatively similar between
models. Figure 4 shows the second PC, which alone is the
most informative PC in the regression. When a model with
PC2 as the only feature is ﬁt to expression, it explains almost
half of gene expression variance (R2 = 0.475). The remaining PCs
and a short discussion are provided in ‘Results’ section in the
Supplementary Material.

Figure 4 shows the relative loading of each component within
PC2 (which accounts for ~48% of explained variance) success-
fully recapitulating known knowledge of histone modiﬁcation

effects. Both models suggest that H4K20me3, H3K27me3 and
H3K9me3 repress gene transcription. Both H3K9me3 and
H4K20me3 are known to be involved in gene silencing, associat-
ing with heterochromatin (Schotta et al., 2004). H3K27me3 is
associated with facilitating binding of the Polycomb repressor
complex 1 (Cao et al., 2002). In PC2, both the loadings of
H3K4me2 and H4K4me3 suggest activating effects, which are
well reported throughout the literature (e.g. Barski et al., 2009;
van Ingen et al., 2008). A difference between the ChIP-seq and
tissue-speciﬁc in silico (PWM + H3K4me3) PCA models is noted
for H3K36me3, which is known to maintain genes in a ‘poised’
state for either activation or repression. The similarity between
the predicted roles by our tissue-speciﬁc in silico method and the
roles predicted by the ChIP-seq data strongly suggests that our in
silico method is capable of making biologically sound predictions
of TF and histone roles.

3.5 Conﬁrmation in GM12878 cells

To insure that our results were not speciﬁc to mES cells, we
repeated our experiments using equivalent data from GM12878
cells. The pattern of the results are extremely similar to those
using mES cell data, with models based on TF ChIP-seq, histone
ChIP-seq and DNase I hypersensitivity explaining more gene
expression variance than models based on TF ChIP-seq alone
(Fig. 5, bars 3 and 6). Compared with the mES cell models, the
relative improvement in accuracy of the ChIP-seq-based gene
expression model when chromatin modiﬁcation and accessibility
data are added is much larger (compare Fig. 2 and Fig. 5). This is
consistent with the fact that the model based on histone and
DNase I data alone (without any TF—speciﬁc data) is much
more accurate than model based on TF ChIP-seq data.
This may be due to the set of TFs we use with the mES cell
data being more complete (with respect to the complete set of
key regulators) than the set we use in the GM12878
experiments. We note as well that the model using PWMs plus
histone and DNase data is far more predictive of gene expression

than the model based solely on TF ChIP-seq data (Fig. 5,
bars 3 and 5).

We note that compared with our previous results in mES cells,
each model explains comparatively less expression variance in
GM12878 cells (compare Figs 1a and 2 with Fig. 5). For ex-
ample, the best performing model in both tissues—ChIP—seq
binding measurements combined with histone modiﬁcation and
chromatin accessibility data—explains ~30% less of the total
gene expression variance in GM12878 cells than in mES cells
(R2=O.412 and R2=O.695, respectively). As noted earlier, this
may be partially due to the TFs used in the model. Additionally,
one of the most informative histone modiﬁcations in mES cells,
H4K20me3 (Fig. 4) was unavailable for GM12878 cells.

We also measure correlation between actual and predicted ex-
pression in GM12878 cells for each regression model and per-
form the singular value decomposition regressions in GM12878
cells and these results are included in the Supplementary
Material.

4 DISCUSSION

We have successfully explained the majority of variance in gene
expression in mES cells by building an integrated model of 12
TFs, seven histone modiﬁcations and DNase hypersensitivity
data. In fact, we ﬁnd that gene expression levels predicted by
both the tissue-speciﬁc in silico models and the histone modiﬁ-
cation and DNase-only model are more highly correlated with
mESC RNA-seq gene expression data than microarray data
from the same tissue type. The wide availability of TF binding
site motifs (Berger and Bulyk, 2009; Matys et al., 2003;
Portales-Casamar et al., 2010) gives our in silico method the ad-
vantage of allowing the evaluation of many different TFs with-
out the cost and time required to perform TF ChIP-seq
experiments, instead requiring only a PWM and H3K4me3
data in the tissue of interest.

Surprisingly, we ﬁnd that using the seven histone modiﬁca-
tions and chromatin accessibility (DNase) data alone produces
a model as descriptive of expression as one using 12 TF ChIP-seq
datasets. By using histone modiﬁcations and DNase data alone,
we explain more variation (up to %70%) in gene expression than
other studies that use more complex in silico models of TF bind-
ing, which vary from @11% (Das et al., 2006) to @33% (Das
et al., 2004). Several of these models incorporate TF—TF inter-
actions and other higher order effects compared with our simpler
log-linear regression models. We also ﬁnd that models combining
histone data with TF ChIP-seq data outperform models using
TF ChIP-seq data alone. This suggests that the histone modiﬁ-
cations perhaps capture an ‘expression state’, containing infor-
mation not captured by our 12 TFs.

Although using tissue-speciﬁc in silico (PWM+H3K4me3)
predictions of our 12 TFs alone does achieve a less-accurate ﬁt
to RNA-seq expression data than using 12 ChIP-seq TFAS, we
ﬁnd that replacing a single TFAS (E2f1) with ChIP-seq data
improves the accuracy of our tissue-speciﬁc in silico method to
be indistinguishable from using all 12 ChIP-seq TFASs.
We hypothesize that this is due to both E2f1 being the most
informative of these 12 TFs (see Supplementary Material) for
predicting expression, and the majority of its binding being

indirect (Bieda et al., 2006) and thus not directly measurable
by sequence-based methods.

Replacing Sox2 in silico TFAS data with Sox2 ChIP-seq
TFAS data, however, actually decreases the ﬁt of the regression
(Fig. la—c). We are unsure of why this is the case, although it
may be due to noise in the ChIP-seq dataset for Sox2.
Re-analyzing the Sox2 ChIP-seq data with more accurate
ChIP-seq peak calling algorithms may shed light on why the
in silico Sox2 TFAS appears to give an improvement in ﬁt
over the ChIP-seq Sox2 TFAS. A recent article shows that
models using this TF ChIP-seq data ﬁt expression more accur-
ately when the ChIP-seq data are re—analyzed with more accurate
peak calling algorithms (Park and Nakai, 2011).

Using PCA, we extended the study of the roles of TFs
(Ouyang et al., 2009) to also include the roles of histone modi-
ﬁcations. The results we obtain, accurately assigning (known)
roles to histone modiﬁcations, suggests that this method is of
value for exploring regulation. Applying this method to the full
set of histone modiﬁcation data from the NIH Roadmap
Epigenomics Project (Bernstein et al., 2010) would be of particu-
lar interest, especially for the examination of less well-studied
histone modiﬁcations, due to the availability of data across a
broad spectrum of tissues.

Some histone modiﬁcations, for example, H4K20me3 are
known to act combinatorially with other marks such as
H3K4me1 (Balakrishnan and Milavetz, 2010). Similarly, some
marks are mutually exclusive with other marks (e. g.
H3K27me3 and H3K27ac) (Pasini et al., 2010). These marks
have also been suggested to potentially play different regulatory
roles at different genomic loci (Kouzarides, 2007). It has been
suggested that the combination of marks around a TSS or en-
hancer form a ‘histone state’ (Ernst et al., 2011). Using the his-
tone states deﬁned by Ernst et al. (2011) rather than raw tag
counts may prove to be more effective in our linear model at
capturing the combinatorial effects of histone modiﬁcations.

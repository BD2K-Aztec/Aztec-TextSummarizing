ABSTRACT

Motivation: The Gene Ontology (G0) is a controlled vocabulary
designed to represent the biological concepts pertaining to gene
products. This study investigates the methods for identifying
informative subsets of GO terms in an automatic and objective
fashion. This task in turn requires addressing the following issues:
how to represent the semantic context of GO terms, what metrics
are suitable for measuring the semantic differences between terms,
how to identify an informative subset that retains as much as possible
of the original semantic information of GO.

Results: We represented the semantic context of a GO term using
the word-usage-profile associated with the term, which enables one
to measure the semantic differences between terms based on the
differences in their semantic contexts. We further employed the
information bottleneck methods to automatically identify subsets of
GO terms that retain as much as possible of the semantic information
in an annotation database. The automatically retrieved informative
subsets align well with an expert-picked GO slim subset, cover
important concepts and proteins, and enhance literature-based GO
annotation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many controlled vocabularies have been developed to deﬁne and
represent biomedical knowledge in the form of ontology, among
which the Uniﬁed Medical Language System (UMLS; Lindberg
et al., 1993), the Gene Ontology (GO; Ashburner et al., 2000)
and the Open Biological Ontology (OBO; Smith et al., 2007)
are three well—established biomedical ontologies covering different
aspects of biomedical knowledge domains. For example, UMLS
is a collection of controlled vocabularies representing broad
biomedical knowledge; OBO consists of a collection of ontologies
representing a variety of biology concepts; and G0 is a controlled
vocabulary representing molecular biology aspects of genes and
proteins. Designed to provide comprehensive representations of

the knowledge in their corresponding domains, the sizes of these
controlled vocabularies are often overwhelmingly large, and many
terms (concepts) deﬁned in the vocabularies are seldom used in
the real world of annotation or indexing. Therefore, there are
needs to identify subsets of the controlled vocabularies to represent
knowledge in a concise manner. Recognizing such needs, the GO
Consortium provides several subsets of GO terms, referred to as GO
slims (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml). These terms
are manually picked by domain experts to cover the major concepts
of speciﬁc domains, with a trade—off between speciﬁcity of the
concepts and the size of the ontology that is deemed acceptable to
the experts. However, it is of both theoretical and practical interests
to develop methods that can automatically identify informative
subsets of GO terms to represent the major semantic concepts in an
objective manner and to meet different needs of different domains.
As a concrete example, we have developed a method (Richards
et al., 2010) for assessing the functional coherence of a gene set by
constructing a graph with G0 terms and genes as nodes, and a part
of evaluation is to visualize such graphs enabling users to capture
the major theme of the functions and their relations to the genes.
However, such a graph usually has a large number of speciﬁc terms
making it difﬁcult for users to identify the main concepts associated
with the genes.

Recently, the Database for Annotation, Visualization and
Integrated Discovery (DAVID) tool box (Huang et al., 2007, 2009)
provides tools to identify representative GO terms based on the genes
associated with them. Similarly, Du et al. (2009) reported clustering
disease ontology (DO) concepts using gene—DO associations as
features. In this study, instead of using gene—centered approaches,
we address the task of automatically identifying subsets of GO
within the framework of semantic representation and information
theory—identifying subsets of GO terms that retain as much as
possible of the original semantic information contained in an
annotation database. In order to achieve the goal, some fundamental
issues related to the semantic information of GO terms need to
be addressed: (i) how to represent the semantic context of a GO
term; (ii) how to measure the difference in semantic context (a.k.a.
semantic distance) between a pair of GO terms; and (iii) how to
identify an informative subset of GO that retains as much as possible
of the semantic information within an annotation database.

Measuring semantic distances between GO terms has attracted
much attention (Lord at al., 2003; Schlicker et al., 2006; Sheehan
et al., 2008; Tao et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2007) in the bioinformatics
ﬁeld. In particular, a quantity referred to as information content (IC)

(Jiang and Conrath, 1998; Lin, 1998; Lord et al., 2003; Resnik,
1995) has been widely used as a measure to assess the amount of
information that a GO term contains, and the difference in the IC
between a pair of terms is used to measure their ‘semantic distance’.
From the information theory point of view, IC measures the amount
of uncertainty associated with observing a term. As such, it does not
represent the ‘semantic context’, and therefore a difference in ICs
does not necessarily reﬂect the ‘semantic dijference’ between two
terms per se.

On the other hand, the deﬁnitions of GO terms are usually
parsimonious and render insufﬁcient information for assessing the
relationships and semantic distances among the terms, as illustrated
by the following examples. In the G0, the semantic meaning of a GO
term is reﬂected by its synonym (a human understandable name) and
its deﬁnition. For example, the synonym and deﬁnition for the term
GO:0050794 are, respectively, ‘Regulation of cellular physiological
process’ and ‘Any process that modulates the frequency, rate or
extent of a cellular process, any of those that are carried out at
the cellular level, but are not necessarily restricted to a single cell’.
Let us further consider one of its child terms, GO:0007165, whose
synonym and deﬁnition are, respectively, ‘Signal transduction’ and
‘The cascade of processes by which a signal interacts with a receptor,
causing a change in the level or activity of a second messenger or
other downstream target, and ultimately ejfecting a change in the
functioning of the cell’. Although the two terms have a parent—child
relationship, they share very few biological words in their synonyms
and deﬁnitions, and the organization of the terms in the GO hierarchy
is guided by additional information/knowledge that is not explicitly
reﬂected in the deﬁnitions. As a result, unless a reader is equipped
with sufﬁcient biological knowledge, it would be difﬁcult to discern
and quantify the relationship of the two terms solely based on their
deﬁnitions.

In this study, we propose to represent the semantic context of GO
terms using the word—usage proﬁles derived from the biomedical
literature associated with the GO terms. This representation enables
us to measure differences in the semantic context between terms
through quantifying the differences in their word—usage proﬁle. This
framework further allows us to use information bottleneck (IB)
methods (Slonim and Tishby, 2000; Tishby et al., 1999) to identify
subsets of GO terms, striving to retain the information with respect
to the word—usage proﬁles of GO terms. Here, we demonstrate that:
(i) our approach to representing semantic context and semantic
distances is intuitive and consistent; (ii) automatically identiﬁed
informative GO subsets align well with the expert—picked GO slim
set and cover broad concepts and proteins; and (iii) automatic
annotation with the informative subsets achieves better accuracy.

2 METHODS
2.1 Preprocessing data and building the GO graph

The gene—GO association ﬁles of mouse, human, yeast and Uniprot were
downloaded from the web site of the GO Annotation (GOA) project of the
European Bioinfonnatics Institute (Camon et al., 2004). Entries containing
the triplet of a gene product id, a GO term and a PubMed identiﬁcation
number (PMID) were extracted and used as the evidence of an association
between GO terms and PMIDs. In this study, we only retain the GO
terms belonging to the Biological Process branch of GO. A total of 33 479
MEDLINE entries corresponding to the PMIDs associated with these terms
were downloaded from the National Center for Biotechnology Information

(NCBI). In the corpus preprocessing, common words were ﬁrst removed
from the corpus according to a standard English ‘stop words’ list; the words
in the corpus were then stemmed using the Porter stemmer algorithm (Porter,
1980); and then the words with fewer than ﬁve occurrences in the corpus
were discarded. As a result, the ﬁnal vocabulary of the corpus had 37 782
unique tokens, and we denoted it with V.

We constructed a graph representation of GO using a Python software
package (Muller et al., 2009). In a G0 graph, each node represents a GO
term, and each directed edge corresponds to the IS_A relationship between a
parent—child GO term pair. Since we are interested in semantic relationships,
only IS_A relationships were considered in the GO graph. We propagated
protein ids (referred to as proteinIDs) associated with each GO node to
their ancestors in a bottom—up fashion. After propagation, each GO node
was further associated with a set of protein ids referred to as proteinAllIDs,
consisting of the union of its own proteinIDs and its children’s proteinAllIDs.
A set of PMIDs, referred to as nodeUniqPMIDs, was associated with each
GO node, and they were further propagated to their ancestor nodes, as
with protein id propagation. At this stage, a new PMID set, referred to
as nodeTotalPMIDs, was created at each node, which is the union of its
own nodeUniqPMIDs and its children’s nodeTotalPMIDs sets. To reﬂect the
semantic context of the literature associated with a GO term, a word—vector
was constructed for each GO node by collecting the words from PubMed
records (titles and abstracts) based on the nodeTotalPMIDs. An element in the
word—vector represents the count of the times that a word is observed in the
PubMed records associated with the GO term. Each word—vector was further
normalized to represent the word (multinomial) probability distribution.

2.2 Semantic distances

2.2.1 Semantic distance based on [C We followed the previous reported
method (Lin, 1998; Lord et al., 2003; Resnik, 1995) to calculate the IC of a
term t as follows,

IC, = —1nP(a,), (1)
where P(at) is the number of annotation instances by term t divided by the
number of total annotation instances in an annotation collection. Then the
semantic distance between the term and its parent p is determined as

D,C(a,, ap) = 11C, —1Cpl. (2)

2.2.2 Distance measures for word-usage proﬁle There are many measures
that can be used to assess the differences among word—usage proﬁles. In
this study, we investigated the following measures in the framework of IE:
Kullback—Leibler (KL) divergence, DKL; L1 distance, DL1; and Euclidean
distance, DEM (El—Yaniv et al., 1997; Lin, 1991; Slonim and Tishby, 2000).
The deﬁnitions of the measures are as follows:

|V|
p(wvlti)

 

 

DKL(19(VV|ti)||P(W|tj))=EMWvlhﬂOgmwvltj)a (3)
WI

DL1(p(wrri).p(v*vrtJ-))=Zlp(w.rri)—p(w.rtj)l, (4)
v=1
|V|

DEu(p(ertz-),p(rvrtj))= waura—mwutmz. (5)

v=1

In the deﬁnitions, pow) denotes the distribution of words associated with a
GO term t, which can be calculated by dividing the number of times a word
w occurs in the documents associated with the term t with the total number
of words in the documents associated with term t. Theoretically speaking, L1
and Eu are real distance measures in that they satisfy the triangle inequality,
while KL is not a metric distance in that it does not satisfy the requirements
of symmetry and triangle inequality.

2.3 IB methods

The IB methods (Slonim and Tishby, 2000; Tishby et al., 1999) provide
a general framework to identify the information structures contained by

Identifying informative subsets of the GO

 

one set of variables with respect to another set of variables based on
information theory. In our case, we deﬁned a vector of variables, T,
to represent the GO terms and a vector of variables, W, to denote the
words observed in the annotation corpus. We then represented observed
GO annotations and their associated words using a |T| >< |W| matrix, such
that the semantic context of a term was represented by a row of words
reﬂecting the word—use proﬁle of the literatures associated with the terms.
The overall information that the GO terms have with respect to the words

can be determined using mutual information as follows:
mm: 2 p(r)p(wrt)logp(w"’. (6)

teT,weW p(w)

 

The task is to identify a new compact presentation of GO terms T such that
the original mutual information I (T; W) is preserved as much as possible
by I (T; W). One way to produce the new representation T is to iteratively
group the members of the original T by merging the terms into clusters
and to use the clusters as the new representation of GO, while constraining
the process to retain as much information as possible. This can be readily
achieved using the agglomerative IB algorithm (Slonim and Tishby, 2000;
Tishby et al., 1999). For each step, the algorithm selects the pair of clusters
that results in the minimal loss in information after merging. The information
loss 81(ti,tj) of merging two terms/clusters t,- and is determined as follows:

P(fi)+P(tj) 19001—1900

13(Vv)=ﬂtp(Vvllt)+Jij(WllJ-)- (11)
In the equations, ltl-l is the number of terms within the cluster ti. The clustering
procedure will eventually result in a graph in which that GO terms sharing
similar word—usage—proﬁles will be preferentially grouped. Two observations
are noteworthy: (i) the information loss of a merge is a weighted Jenson—
Shanon (J S) divergence consisting of two components: the losses resulted
from removing nodes i and j. Thus, the loss is decomposable; (ii) the JS
distance, D5 in Equation (9) is one of many possible measures that can
be used to measure the difference in two distributions, and other word—use—
proﬁle—based distance measures discussed in the previous subsection can also
be used in place of D5 as in the IB framework.

2.4 GO graph compression

While the agglomerative IB clustering is capable of producing de novo
clusters as informative representations of GO terms, it is more sensible to
identify such clusters that comply with the current organization of GO terms.
To this end, we extended the IB methods so that clustering (collapsing) of GO
terms obeys the predeﬁned GO graph structure. This approach transforms
the task of identifying an informative subset of GO terms to a graph
compression (trimming) task, instead of attempting to identify informative
clusters ab initio. Taking advantage of the observation that information loss
from merging a pair of GO terms is decomposable, we developed a greedy
algorithm to sequentially remove the leaf terms that resulted in the least
information loss, see Algorithm $1 in Supplementary Materials. Let t,- denote
a leaf node, tp stand for its parent node, w represent the word vector associated
with the term and |t,-| denote the number of the descendant nodes of ti. We
determined the information loss of removing a leaf node as follows:

(3101-)=p(tt)DJs(p(Wltt)ap(Wltp))a (12)

 

where w

DJS(P(V—’VIti)ap(V—13Itp))= mDKL(p(Vvltz-)l Ip(I7VItp))a (14)
itizﬂ. (15)

ltpl

In addition to the above weighted J S, we also used the weighted L1 distance
(WL1) to measure information loss as follows:

(3101-)=P(tt)DL1(p(Wltt)ap(VV|tp))- (16)

2.5 Graph-based multi-label classiﬁcation

The graph—based multi—label classiﬁcation system with support vector
machine (SVM; Vapnik, 1998) as base classiﬁers was utilized to perform
graph—based multi—label classiﬁcation (Jin et al., 2008). In brief, a protein
annotated with a GO term is also considered to be annotated by ancestors
of the term because of the hierarchical organization of GO; thus, the
protein annotation is a multiple—labeling task. The system performs localized
classiﬁcation in a top—down manner, referred to as TP—SVM. When given a
PubMed record related to a protein, the TP—SVM outputs a graph consisting
of predicted positive GO terms as candidate annotations for the protein. In
this study, the classiﬁcation performance on the trimmed GO graph was
evaluated in the same manner as described in Jin et al. (2008).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Semantic context of GO terms

The task of identifying an informative subset of GO terms requires
us to quantify the amount of information retained by the subset
as guidance to search for informative terms. In other words, we
need to measure the differences in the semantic context to reﬂect
the amount of loss in semantic information during the process.
We reason that the semantic context of a GO term can be more
effectively represented by the word—usage—proﬁle associated with
it because, as the semantic symbols of human languages, a word—
usage—proﬁle of a term reﬂects the context in which the concept is
being discussed. By collecting all the words used to discuss a concept
and its descendents, the word—usage—proﬁle of a term can overcome
the difﬁculty resulting from the parsimony of GO deﬁnitions, and
the large number of available annotation instances may provide a
potentially more accurate representation of context than a single
deﬁnition. Under such a setting, the semantic distances between a
pair of terms can be readily represented by the differences in the
word—usage—proﬁles.

We investigated and compared different measures of semantic
distances, namely the IC—based semantic distance and three different
word—usage—proﬁle distances: (i) the WL1 distance; (ii) the J S
divergence (El—Yaniv et al., 1997; Lin, 1991; Slonim and Tishby,
2000); and (iii) the Euclidean distance. Ideally, a semantic distance
between a pair of GO terms should remain constant as long as the
semantic meanings of the terms are unchanged. However, measures
based on annotation instances, including those studied in this article,
will change as the annotation instances change. Under such a
circumstance, a good measure should become stable as the number
of annotation instances increases. To investigate the stability of the
semantic distances, we ﬁrst identiﬁed a subset of common GO terms
that have been used to annotate genes from multiple species. The G0
subset constitutes a subgraph of 1355 GO nodes (terms) and 2170
edges. We then monitored the impact of adding more annotation
instances on the semantic distances of the edges, by evaluating the

percent of changes in the edge distances after progressively adding
annotation instances from mouse, human, yeast and the combined
multiple—species Uniprot dataset. The results are shown in Figure 1.

The panels in Figure 1 show the cumulative distributions of the
number of edges binned according to their percent changes in the
edge distances after sequentially adding annotation instances. The
results from the ﬁgure can be interpreted as follows. When more
annotation instances are added to the GO, all annotation—instance—
based semantic measures tend to be more stable (i.e. edges show
progressively smaller percent changes after addition annotations).
Semantic distances measured with the IB—based methods showed
better convergence (i.e. more edges with small percent changes). For
example, when adding annotation instances from Uniprot, >60% of
edges measured with WL1 showed < 10% change in distances.

Although all annotation—based measures show a tendency to
converge, the underlying mechanisms are different. For the measures
based on word—usage—proﬁles, the stabilization of semantic distances
is due to the convergence of the word—usage—proﬁles; for IC—based
measures, the stabilization of edge distances is likely due to the
relatively small change in the probabilities of observing terms as
total annotations increase and the shrinking effect of the logarithm.
It should also be noted that, due to the differences in their scales
and the non—metric nature of the above measures, it is difﬁcult and
meaningless to directly compare the changes in the numeric values
of different measures.

3.2 Identifying informative GO subsets

The capability of representing the semantic context of GO terms
with word—usage—proﬁles and measuring their differences enables
us to quantify the amount of information retained (or lost) during
the process of selecting informative GO terms. This information can
be used to guide the compression of the GO graph. The intuition
of our method is as follows: when a leaf GO term is removed

Fig. 2. Compressed GO subgraphs. The graph of Biological Process
subontology is compressed under different setting of edge distance measures,
as indicated next to the graphs. A large version of the ﬁgure is shown
in Supplementary Figure S1.1, and the names of GO terms are listed in
Supplementary Table S2.

from the GO graph, its semantic context information is lost, but
its parent term retains some of the leaf term’s information because
of their IS_A relationship. The amount of information loss should be
proportional to the differences in the semantic context between the
pruned term and its parent(s), and such differences can be readily
measured according to IB methods based on the divergence of the
word distributions associated with the terms (Slonim et al., 2002,
2005).

With the algorithm deﬁned in Algorithm Sl in Supplementary
Materials, we compressed the GO graph of the Biological Process
using the annotation data from all species. We used the potential
information loss, calculated with the IB—based semantic measures
(JS and WL1), as the edge weight to prune this GO graph. As
comparisons, we also used the IC and Eu to calculate edge weights in
the algorithm although these two measures do not necessarily reﬂect
the semantic loss. For the purpose of visualizing the characteristics
and differences among these measures, we compressed GO graph to
produce two sets of subgraphs: one group consisting of subgraphs
with a total of 20 nodes (shown in Fig. 2) and the other consisting
of the subgraphs with a total of 20 leaves (shown in Supplementary
Fig. S1.2). We investigated the characteristics of the graphs in the
following aspects.

An ideal compression of a G0 graph should lead to a subgraph
whose leaf GO terms cover major biological aspects of the GO graph
without much semantic overlap. One possible way to quantify such
a characteristic is to calculate the ratio of the number of leaf nodes
over the total number of nodes in the compressed graph, referred to
as R”; the higher the ratio, the more diverse the concepts covered
because of less overlap among the concepts. We calculated the ratios
for the subgraphs obtained using different edge length measures and
ranked the subgraphs according to their ths. Figure 2 (subgraphs
with a total of 20 nodes) shows that different semantic distance
measures produced subgraphs with distinct patterns; their ths are

Identifying informative subsets of the GO

 

as follows, WL1: 0.9; JS: 0.60; IC: 0.55; and Eu: 0.15, and the ths
for subgraphs with 20 leaves are WL1: 0.91; JS: 0.67; IC: 0.57; and
Eu: 0.14. The subgraphs obtained based on the IB framework with
WL1 and JS measures show higher ths, and their leaves cover a
broader range of concepts. On the other hand, the concepts from the
subgraphs obtained using the IC—based edge distance and Euclidean
distance show increasingly higher degrees of overlap. It should be
noted that, when the total size of a subgraph is ﬁxed, the broadness
of the coverage and the speciﬁcity of the concepts trade—off with
each other. The graphs returned by different measures span a broad
spectrum, with WL1 covering broad but general concepts and Eu
containing a narrow range of more speciﬁc concept. Based on these
observations, WL1 and J S measures performed better than IC and
Eu measures in terms of meeting the goal of retaining as much
semantic information of the GO graph as possible with a relatively
small number of GO terms.

Another aspect of assessing the utility of the subgraphs returned
by different measures is to evaluate how many proteins are covered
by the leaf (speciﬁc) terms of subgraphs. Ideally, a good informative
subset of GO terms should cover a broad range of concepts and as
many proteins in the original annotation database as possible. We
counted the number of proteins covered by each of the leaf terms of
the GO subgraph, shown as the number in parenthesis within each
node in Supplementary Figure S1.2. The total numbers of proteins
covered by the leaves of the subgraphs based on different measures
are as follows: WL1: 13 042; IS: 62132; IC: 19; and Eu: 188.

The results clearly indicate that IC—based semantic measure is
not suitable for identifying an informative subset under this setting.
Instead of measuring the difference in semantic context, the IC—based
measure assesses in essence the difference in protein counts; as such
a longer edge is usually the one with many proteins associated at the
parent end but very few proteins at the child end. This leads to the
phenomenon that the leaf nodes of the subgraph derived with this
measure are the ones with the least number of protein annotation
instances. On the other hand, IB—based compression retains leaf
nodes covering diverse concepts, thus potentially covering more
proteins. Based on the results, we believe that the sub graph returned
by a J S—based measure is the most suitable informative subset due
to its balanced breadth and depth and the larger number of proteins
covered by its leaves.

3.3 Aligning informative subsets with G0 slim

The capability of identifying subgraphs in an automatic and
objective manner would enable one to identify potential ‘slim’
GO sets for different research domains, according to different
criteria and to meet different needs. It would be of interest to see
how well the automatically identiﬁed subsets agree with manually
picked GO slim terms, which arguably can be treated as the ‘gold
standards’ of informative subsets. We downloaded the yeast GO slim
terms (http://www.geneontology.org/GO.slims.shtml) and extracted
all terms from the Biological Process namespace (a total of 35),
which were used to reconstruct the GO subgraph with these terms
as leaves. Then we used the graph compression algorithm to identify
subgraphs that had exactly 35 leaves from the yeast GO graph with
the four measures. In order to make a comparison, the subgraphs
returned by the compression algorithm were further merged with
the yeast GO slim subgraph, as shown in Figure 3. The names of
the GO terms in the ﬁgure are listed in Supplementary Table S3.

Fig. 3. Alignments of GO slim and compressed subgraphs. The compressed
subgraphs using different semantic measures were merged with the subgraph
constructed with yeast GO slim terms as leaves. Green nodes are GO slim
leaf terms; red nodes are leaves of compressed graphs; deep yellow nodes
are shared by GO slim and the compressed subgraph; uncolored nodes
are non—leaves. The high—resolution versions of the ﬁgure are shown in
Supplementary Figures S2 and S3.

We evaluated the ‘goodness’ of the informative subsets by
measuring how close the leaf terms of the automatically identiﬁed
subsets are located to those in the GO slim subset on the merged
graph. We cast the evaluation as a match assignment problem (Kuhn,
1955, 1956; Munkres, 1957). The task is to ﬁnd an optimal pairwise
match between the entities from two sets so that the total cost of
the matches is minimized. In our case, we sought to ﬁnd a one—to—
one match between 35 leaf terms in the informative GO subsets and
those in the GO slim subset so that the overall distance between
the two sets is minimal, where the distance of a matching pair was
measured by the number of edges in the shortest path between them.
We ﬁrst used Dijkstra’s algorithm to ﬁnd the shortest paths between
all leaf pairs and applied Munkres algorithm (Munkres, 1957) and
then ﬁnd the optimal matches through these shortest paths. The total
numbers of edges after matching were as follows, WL1: 103; J S:
87; IC: 124; and Eu: 187 (see Supplementary Table S4.1—S4.4 for
details). The results indicate that the informative subset returned by
the IB method based on IS divergence was most closely aligned
with the manually picked GO slim subset. In particular, 7 out of 35
of GO terms from the subset directly intersected with the GO slim
subset, while none of those from IC— and Eu—based subgraphs did.

In addition to assessing alignment of the informative GO subsets
with the human—chosen GO slim subset, we also evaluated how
many proteins from the database could be covered (annotated) by the
informative subsets. As stated before, an ideal subset of informative
GO terms should not only cover a broad range of biological concepts
but also annotate as many different proteins as possible. We have
evaluated the total number of different proteins covered by the leaf
terms (the union of all leaves’ proteinAllIDs) in each compressed GO
subgraph, and the results were as follows: WL1: 2297; J S: 4597; IC:
72; and Eu: 52. Compared with 3952 proteins covered by the GO
slim subset, the results indicate that the GO compression with the
IB method based on WL1 and JS measures was comparable with

the manual GO compression in terms of the number of annotated
proteins. We further evaluated the number of the different intersected
proteins covered by the J S— and WL1—derived leaf subsets and the
GO slim leaf subset, and the counts were: J S—vs—GOSlim: 3665 and
WL1—vs—GOSlim: 1856. In summary, we believe that the informative
subset of GO terms identiﬁed using the JS—based measures is the
most suitable informative subset, due to its closest relationship to
the manually picked GO slim terms and its broader coverage of
proteins.

3.4 Automatic protein annotation with informative GO
subsets

The main purpose of G0 is to annotate gene products in a uniﬁed
and computable format. One main thrust in bioinformatics is to
automatically annotate proteins based on the literatures associated
with genes. Often, this task is cast as a text categorization problem
in which, upon given a text related to a gene, a computational agent
predicts what GO annotation can be assigned to the gene (Camon
et al., 2005; Cohen and Hersh, 2006; Cohen and Hunter, 2008). As
reported in our previous study (J in et al., 2008), out of 5797 observed
GO terms associated with documents in the GO annotation database,
>80% of them had fewer than 10 training documents, which poses
severe challenges to contemporary text classiﬁcation algorithms.
One practical approach is to train text classiﬁers with fewer but more
informative classes. The graph compression approach developed
in this study enables us to choose the subset of GO terms in an
automatic and objective manner. This allows users to select not only
the level of speciﬁcity but also the classiﬁcation accuracy of an
informative subset to meet their annotation needs.

We tested our graph—based multi—label classiﬁcation algorithm
(TP—SVM) on the progressively compressed GO graphs to
investigate the impact of compression with different semantic
measures on classiﬁcation accuracy. In order to verify that the
enhanced classiﬁcation accuracy was not simply due to reduced
number of classes, we also trim graph by randomly selecting a leaf
node, referred to as RandomTrim, in contrast to selectively trimming
nodes according to certain criteria by our compression approach. In
another experiment, we tested a method that naively attempts to
retain orthogonal nodes during trimming, in which all pairwise dot—
products (a measure of similarity) between the word vectors of leaf
nodes were calculated at each step, and the leaf with the highest total
similarity with all other nodes, a.k.a. least orthogonal to others, was
selectively trimmed, referred to as DotProdTrim (see Algorithm S2
in Supplementary Materials for details).

We compressed the GO graph to different sizes using different
measures or methods, which then were used as the class hierarchy
to train TP—SVM. Figure 4 shows the F —scores (a metric reﬂecting
overall accuracy of an agent) of the classiﬁers trained with the GO
of different sizes. In this ﬁgure, each point represents the F —score of
a classiﬁer trained on a graph with a speciﬁc number of leaf nodes,
e. g. the graph compressed using the WL1 measure with 100 leaves.

The ﬁgure shows that as the size of GO graphs becomes
smaller, the overall classiﬁcation accuracy increases and that the
classiﬁcation accuracies based on the graphs produced by IB
methods are better than the others. These overall trends can be
explained as follows. First, it is understandable in that the GO
nodes in the smaller hierarchy tend to have more training documents
associated due to the propagation of training documents. Second,

Number of leaves

Fig. 4. Impact of GO compression on TP—SVM performance. The ﬁgure
shows how TP—SVM performance (F —score) changes with respect to the
number of leaves (X —axis) in the progressively compressed GO graph. The
plots for recall and precision of the classiﬁers are shown in Figure S4.

the possible explanation for superior performance of graph from IB
methods is that our compression algorithm tends to retain leaves
(classes) that are differentiable. As such, it is not surprising that
the classiﬁer performed best when trained with the subgraphs
derived with the WL1 measure because, as shown in Figure 2,
the classes in such subgraphs are mostly orthogonal to each other.
In comparison, the methods of simply reducing the size of class
hierarchy or naively attempting to retain the orthogonality of leaves
do not necessarily improve classiﬁcation accuracy as much as the
principled IB methods. The recall and precision of the algorithm with
the GO of different sizes are shown in Supplementary Figure S4.

We further evaluated the TD—SVM performance on the GO slim
and the compressed GO graphs of the same number of leaves
with yeast—speciﬁc PubMed records, and the results are shown
in Supplementary Figure S5. The results show that the classiﬁers
trained with subgraphs derived with WL1 and J S measures perform
better than those based on yeast GO slim, and the latter outperform
those trained with the sub graph derived with Eu. The results indicate
that information theory based WL1 and J S methods are capable
of retaining GO terms reﬂecting distinct concepts that are more
differentiable than those manually picked GO—slim terms, and that
simple trimming based on Eu measure does not capture the same
information.

4 CONCLUSION

Combining word—usage—proﬁles with IB methods provides a means
to identify within the complexity of GO informative subsets for
speciﬁc purposes.

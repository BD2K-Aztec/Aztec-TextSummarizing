ABSTRACT

Summary: The lnfobiotics Workbench is an integrated software
suite incorporating model specification, simulation, parameter
optimization and model checking for Systems and Synthetic Biology.
A modular model specification allows for straightforward creation of
large-scale models containing many compartments and reactions.
Models are simulated either using stochastic simulation or numerical
integration, and visualized in time and space. Model parameters and
structure can be optimized with evolutionary algorithms, and model
properties calculated using probabilistic model checking.
Availability: Source code and binaries for Linux, Mac and Windows
are available at http://www.lnfobiotics.org/infobiotics-workbench/;

1 INTRODUCTION

A comprehensive and generic framework for modelling biological
systems from the molecular to organismal scales remains a distant
prospect. As a step towards this, we have developed a modelling
framework and supporting simulation and analysis software that is
general enough to model a diverse range of systems, and tailored
towards large, multi—compartment cellular systems. We have used
our software to successfully model and address a number of
problems in Systems and Synthetic Biology, including abscisic
acid—related signal transduction networks (Dupeux et al., 2011),
multicellular molecular transport in Arabidopsis thaliana (Twycross
et al., 2010), and also in synthetic biology design (Cao et al., 2010).

2 MODELLING FRAMEWORK

To facilitate the incremental modelling and rapid prototyping
of multi—compartment systems, we have developed two
complementary model representation languages: mcss—SBML,
an extension of the Systems Biology Markup Language
(SBML) (Hucka et al., 2003); and a domain speciﬁc language

(DSL), implementing lattice population P systems (Romero—
Campero et al., 2009). Both languages allow the speciﬁcation
of sets of, perhaps different, reactions in multiple compartments
and transport of molecules between compartments (internal and
adjacent in 2D space). These, in turn, can be organized in modules
(parameterizable sets of reactions), which promote (sub)model
reuse and hence facilitate debugging of model entities capturing
biological functions. mcss—SBML models can be easily designed
using existing visual editing tools such as CellDesigner (Funahashi
et al., 2003), and allow straightforward interchange of models with
other software tools that support SBML. Our DSL is designed to
provide a higher degree of control over the models being speciﬁed,
and enables reuse of top—level compartments and modules between
models.

3 CAPABILITIES

Infobiotics Workbench provides an assistive graphical interface to
guide users in their parameter choices when performing simulation,
model checking and parameter optimization experiments, and in
analysing the results of these experiments. For computationally
expensive models, experiments can be performed on high—
performance computing clusters using the command line interface,
and results analysed with the desktop GUI.

3.1 Simulation

The simulator offers a choice of either deterministic numerical
approximation with standard solvers or execution with a stochastic
simulation algorithm (SSA) (Gillespie, 2007). For performing
deterministic simulations, we use the ODE solvers provided by the
GNU Scientiﬁc Library (GSL) (Galassi et al., 2009). These include
explicit Runge—Kutta and implicit ODE solvers. As well as providing
a baseline implementation of the canonical Gillespie Direct Method
for stochastic simulations, we have developed a number of optimised
multi—compartment SSAs (Romero—Campero et al., 2009) which
greatly improve performance and decrease simulation time for large
models. With these algorithms, one can simulate models with tens of
thousands of compartments and hundreds of reactions and species
per compartment. The simulation results interface (Fig. 1A and B)
enables the extraction and plotting of selected data. Time series
are plotted combined in one plot or stacked/tiled with individual
amounts or concentration axes for better comparison of ﬂuctuations

with different orders of magnitude, and exported in text and Excel
formats for further processing. For larger 2D models, a more
intuitive overview of system behaviour is provided, which visualizes
the spatially distributed amounts of selected species as 3D surfaces,
animated over time (Fig. 1C). Frequency of species quantities at a
given time can also be plotted as a histogram across compartments
or runs.

3.2 Model checking

The Infobiotics Workbench interfaces with two model checkers:
PRISM (Kwiatkowska et al., 2010) and MC2 (Donaldson and
Gilbert, 2008), allowing model properties, such as the probability
of a species exceeding a certain threshold, to be determined. The
results for each formula can be plotted in two ways: a 2D plot of
the probability that the property is satisﬁed against one variable,
or a 3D plot of probability against two variables. Both plot types
can be used for queries with higher numbers of variables, enabling
N—dimensional results sets to be interrogated.

3.3 Parameter and structure optimization

The Infobiotics Workbench can adjust the simulated behaviour of a
model such that it ﬁts time series data, e.g. molecular concentrations.
This is done by optimizing the values of stochastic rate constants

or the collection of modules that deﬁne a model’s structure.
Several parameter optimization algorithms are provided, e. g.
differential evolution (Storn and Price, 1997) and covariance matrix
adaptation (Hansen and Ostermeier, 2001). Structure optimization
is performed using a genetic algorithm approach that we have
developed (Cao et al., 2010). The output of an optimization
experiment is overlaid on the target, enabling a visual interpretation
of ﬁt.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE WORK

The Infobiotics Workbench is an integrated in silico platform for
model speciﬁcation, simulation, formal veriﬁcation and optimization
of large—scale systems and synthetic biology models. We are
currently implementing advanced simulation algorithms to further
improve its computational efﬁciency, and intend to leverage GPGPU
technology in the near future. Moreover, we would investigate how
to link the Infobiotics Workbench with community—wide model
repositories (Cooling et al., 2010). Further information, tutorials
and examples are available at http://www.infobiotics.org/infobiotics
—workbench/. The community can report bugs or request features at

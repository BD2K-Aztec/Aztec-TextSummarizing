ABSTRACT

Motivation: Estimating gene regulatory networks over biological
lineages is central to a deeper understanding of how cells evolve
during development and differentiation. However, one challenge in
estimating such evolving networks is that their host cells not only
contiguously evolve, but also branch over time. For example, a stem
cell evolves into two more specialized daughter cells at each division,
forming a tree of networks. Another example is in a laboratory setting:
a biologist may apply several different drugs individually to malignant
cancer cells to analyze the effects of each drug on the cells; the cells
treated by one drug may not be intrinsically similar to those treated
by another, but rather to the malignant cancer cells they were derived
from.

Results: We propose a novel algorithm, Treegl, an 151 plus total
variation penalized linear regression method, to effectively estimate
multiple gene networks corresponding to cell types related by a
tree-genealogy, based on only a few samples from each cell type.
Treegl takes advantage of the similarity between related networks
along the biological lineage, while at the same time exposing
sharp differences between the networks. We demonstrate that our
algorithm performs significantly better than existing methods via
simulation. Furthermore we explore an application to a breast cancer
dataset, and show that our algorithm is able to produce biologically
valid results that provide insight into the progression and reversion
of breast cancer cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge in systems biology is to quantitatively understand
and model the topological and functional properties of cellular
networks, such as the transcriptional regulatory circuitries and
signal transduction pathways that control cell behavior in complex
biological processes. In complex organisms, biological processes
such as differentiation and development are often controlled by a
large number of molecules that exchange information in a spatial—
temporally speciﬁc and context—dependent manner. These cellular

networks are inevitably changing to take on different functions
and reacting to changing environments. This necessitates studying
different networks for each condition, such as each different
developmental stage, tissue subtype, and cell lineage.

Most existing techniques for reconstructing molecular networks
based on high—throughput data ignore the intricate dependencies
between networks of closely related biological subjects.

For example, when studying cancer development, it is common to
infer gene networks based on microarray data from different cancer
specimens or cell lines separately and independently, despite that
these biomaterials are usually collected over a contiguous disease
progression course. As we discuss in detail, such an ‘isolationist’
strategy can compromise both the statistical power and biological
insight of the inferred networks. In this article, we present a
new methodology called Treegl, which adopts a statistically more
powerful and biologically more natural ‘connectionist’ principle.
Treegl reconstructs gene networks in related biological subjects via
an inter-dependent approach such that the inferred networks directly
embody and exploit the relationships of the biological subjects
they represent. As a result, this reveals deeper insight on how the
structure, function, and behavior of such networks evolve during
evolution, differentiation and environmental perturbation.

To better understand our rationale, take the analysis of stem cell
differentiation as an example. It is well known that all organ— and
tissue—speciﬁc cells in a multicellular organism are differentiated
from a stem cell, following a well—known genealogy (Figure 1).
To date, gene networks from many of these organs and tissues
have been derived using a variety of computational or experimental
technologies (Basso et al., 2005; Hyatt et al., 2006; Li, 2004).
However, knowledge about the cell lineage has rarely been utilized
in constructing these networks. For example, according to the
genealogy in Figure l, the platelets are more closely related to the red
blood cells than to the lymphoblasts. The gene networks present in
the platelets and red blood cells are thus expected to be more similar;
microarray data from red blood cells should reﬂect the topology of
a platelet’s network to a greater extent than that of a lymphoblast
network.

Is it therefore legitimate and possible to use the red blood cell’s
microarray in addition to the platelet’s microarray to infer the
platelet’s network? And, if yes, how? Essentially, what one needs to
handle is a network of networks. In this article, we focus on the class
of tree—shaped biological genealogies. This class of genealogies can
be naturally found in crop and animal breeding, species evolution,
cell—line lineage construction, and carcinogenesis.

the root is the blood stem cell. Over time it differentiates into more specialized
cells along the genealogy, eventually becoming red blood cells, platelets,
or white blood cells. Cell types closer together in the genealogy (e.g.
lymphoblasts and white blood cells), are expected to have more similar gene
regulatory networks than those far apart in the genealogy (e.g. red blood
cells and white blood cells).

1.1 Related work

There has been a lot of previous work on reverse engineering
gene networks. However, most of this work revolves around
estimating a static network, losing the dynamic information that
we seek to explore and exploit. For example, Friedman et al.
(2000) proposed using Bayesian networks to reverse engineer gene
networks. However, their method assumed all the measurements of
gene expression from the network in question were independent
and identically distributed (i. i.d.) from the same distribution, and
introduced extra variables to try to capture certain stationary
(rather than time—evolving) time dependence. Furthermore, their
algorithm was not scalable to the high dimensional problems that
we are considering. Margolin et al. (2006) proposed an information
theoretic approach that has good statistical properties, but limits
the network structure to having neglible loops. Yeung et al. (2002)
proposed using a singular value decomposition. Like Friedman et al.
(2000), these methods also assumed the data were i.i.d. from an
invariant network.

Recently, researchers have begun tackling the time—varying case,
building off sparse regression techniques, like the lasso (Tibshirani,
1996). Lozano et al. proposed an approach that uses the group
lasso and the notion of Granger causality to estimate causality
among variables instead of estimating the entire sequence of
networks (Lozano et al., 2009). Bonneau et al. (2006) propose
using the kinetic equation in conjunction with the lasso to account
for time series data (but also learn only one network). Ahmed
and Xing created TESLA (Ahmed and Xing, 2009), and Song,
Kolar and Xing proposed KELLER (Song et al., 2009a), to
estimate a chain of evolving networks over time. Song et al. also
proposed time varying dynamic Bayesian networks (Song et al.,
2009b).

However, all these methods estimate networks that evolve as a
chain of graphs over time, not a genealogy, which hinders them
from being naturally applied to many of the common biological
applications mentioned earlier.

1.2 Our contribution

In this work, we move beyond the static and time—varying
assumptions, and focus on the more general case of tree—evolving
genealogies that we believe are more natural for the biological
phenomena that we seek to explore. We propose an algorithm called
Tree-smoothed graphical lasso (Treegl), that can effectively and
jointly recover evolving regulatory networks present in multiple
cell—types related by a tree genealogy.

Our approach takes advantages of the similarities of networks
nearby in the genealogy, but can also reveal sharp differences.
Moreover, by building on the method of neighborhood selection via
the lasso (Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2006), our approach works
well even when the number of genes is much larger than the number
of samples.

We were motivated by the many applications discussed above
in the development of Treegl. However, in this article, we focus
on applying Treegl to study the progression and reversion of breast
cancer cells in 3D organotypic cultures (Itoh et al., 2007; Liu et al.,
2004; Weaver et al., 1997). The cell—line in question begins as
nonmalignant, organized and nontumorigenic cells that progress to
apolar, disorganized and tumorigenic cancer cells. Several different
drugs are applied and the genealogy then branches to different
reverted cells with partially polarized structures. Although our
dataset is small, we are able to show that we obtain biologically
valid and intriguing results through our method.

2 METHODS

2.1 Probabilistic representation of gene networks

Consider the problem of modeling N different, but independent (we will
consider dependency in the next subsection), gene regulatory networks, each
corresponding to a unique cell type (say, type n) from a cell bank 8 where
lBl =N, with S, i. i.d. microarray measurements of all genes in cell type n,
and consisting of the same set of p genes across all cell types. Without loss
of generality, a gene network can be represented by a probabilistic graphical
model, such as a Markov random ﬁeld (MRF) if the gene states are taken
as discrete (Segal et al., 2003), or a Gaussian graphical model (GGM) if
the gene states are set to the continuous measurements of the microarray
signal (Dobra et al., 2004), or a Bayesian network (Friedman et al., 2000).
In this article, we use cell—type speciﬁc undirected Gaussian graphical models
to model the gene networks, but the general principle of our method can be
extended to discrete Markov random ﬁelds as well.

Let Q“) =(V(”),8(”)) represent a network in cell type n, of which Vol)
denotes the set of genes, and 80” denotes the set of edges over vertices. An
edge (u,v) e 80” can represent a relationship (e.g. inﬂuence or interaction)
between genes a and v. Let x0”)=(x§”’”,...,x,2”’”)/, where neN, se
{1, ... , Sn}, and p = |V|, be a random vector of nodal states that are real valued
and standardized, such that each dimension has mean 0 and variance 1.
We assume that X(”) follows a multivariate Gaussian distribution with
mean 0 and covariance matrix 201), so that the conditional independence
relationships among the genes can be encoded as a Gaussian graphical model.
It is a well known fact that for GGMs, edges in the graph correspond to
non—zero elements in the inverse covariance matrix (known as the precision
matrix), which we denote by S201) :2 (wﬁbwem. Thus, estimating the graph
structure is equivalent to selecting the non—zero elements of the precision
matrix.

As commonly done, instead of directly estimating the precision matrix
elements will), we estimate the partial correlation coefﬁcients p(”), where ,0)?
is the correlation between gene a and gene v conditioned on the values of all
the other genes. Partial correlation coefﬁcients are related to the precision

As shown in Equation (1), ,0)? is zero if and only if com, is zero. Therefore,
in terms of network structure estimation, the network resultant from the non—

zero ,033) is equivalent to that from the nonzero will). Furthermore, the partial

correlation is quite intuitive in the sense that a high positive value of ,0)?
indicates that the genes u and v are strongly positively correlated (conditioned
on the other genes), a low negative value indicates the genes are strongly
negatively correlated (conditioned on the other genes), and ,0)? =0 for all
(u, v) ¢ 801). As a result, we simply consider estimating the partial correlation

coefﬁcients and designate these as the edge values in Q“):

8<">={p£::> : ipizri >0}. (2)

2.2 Neighborhood selection

A number of recent papers have studied how to estimate this model from data
that are assumed to be i. i.d. samples from the model, and the asymptotic
guarantee of the estimator (Bresler et al., 2008; Wainwright et al., 2007).
In particular, an efﬁcient neighborhood selection algorithm (Meinshausen
and Bijhlmann, 2006) based on ill—norm regularized regression has been
proven effective (often called neighborhood selection). In this approach, the
neighborhood of each gene u is estimated independently using a penalized
linear regression with a lasso—style (i.e. ill—norm) regularization over edge
weights. The regression goes around every gene in the network, leading
to completion of a network. In every neighbor estimation step, gene u is
treated as a response variable, all the other genes are the covariates, and the
weights are the correlations between the other genes and u. More formally,
let X\,, indicate the p —1 vector of the values of all genes except u. Similarly,
0V, 2: {6W :v e V\u}. Using a well known result (Lauritzen, 1996) that the
partial correlation coefﬁcients can be related to the following regression

Some algebra gives that

The above equations basically indicate that we can solve for the regression
coefﬁcients 0\,, using a linear regression, where the response variable
corresponds to X“ and the covariates correspond to X\,,. The corresponding
partial correlation coefﬁcients can be recovered using Equation (5). An [51
penalty is applied to encourage a sparse solution, as in the lasso (Tibshirani,
1996).

This surprisingly simple method, when applied over i. i.d. nodal samples
(e. g. i. i.d. microarray measurements), has very strong theoretical guarantees
about recovering the correct network structure. It has been shown that under
certain variable conditions it is possible to obtain an estimator of the edge
set 8 that achieves a property known as sparsistency (Meinshausen and
Bijhlmann, 2006; Wainwright et al., 2007), which refers to the case where
a consistent estimator of 8, i.e. the network structure, can be attained when
the true degree (i.e. number of neighbors) of each node is much smaller than
the size of the graph p (even when the sample size is signiﬁcantly smaller
than the number of genes).

Unfortunately, in the case of the tree—evolving network concerned in this
article, we have to deal with a much harder problem since our samples are
no longer i. id, and our networks are no longer independent of each other.
For this purpose, we need to extend the basic neighborhood selection lasso
algorithm as shown in the following subsections.

2.3 Tree-evolving gene networks over biological
lineages

We are interested in reconstructing a set of networks 9(1), ...,QW) that are
not independent of each other, but are related by a genealogy over their
respective host cell—types, thereby constituting a tree evolving network.
Formally, given a genealogy over members of a cell bank 8, we introduce an
ordering over networks 9(1), ...,QW) encoded by the following inheritance
relationship: for each cell type n e 8, let 71(n) be the parent of type n in the
tree, thus Q“) is a descendant of 9070”). For a pair of networks identiﬁed
by the genealogy, we assume that their topology should be similar while
allowing for differences. For example, consider again Figure 1. In this
case, 31(blood stem cell)=NULL, 71(lymphoid stem cell) =blood stem cell,
n(lymphoblast)=lypmhoid stem cell, etc. Note that this framework is
ﬂexible and allows for various types of trees since each parent can have
a different number of children. We assume without loss of generality that
9(1) is the root of the tree.

Based on the GGM representation of gene networks described in the
previous subsection, we have a set of GGMs whose edges (partial correlation
coefﬁcients) p(”),Vn are evolving across the genealogy. Since the partial
correlations are functions of the conditions rather than constants such a
model is an instance of a varying-coeﬁ‘icient model (Fan and Yao, 2005).
Varying—coefﬁcient models were popularized in the work of (Cleveland and
Grosse, 1991) and (Hastie and Tibshirani, 1993), and have been applied to
a variety of domains to model and predict time— or space— varying response
to multidimensional inputs. In our case, we are particularly interested in a
certain type of parameter change: the change between zero and non—zero
values between pm) and p(”(”», also known as the structural change of the
model.

The tree evolving networks described above are effective for modeling a
plethora of biological processes such as the growth and reversion of cancer. A
biologist may apply several treatments to a malignant cancer cell and would
like to analyze the effects of the treatments on the regulatory network. The
tree structure naturally expresses the dependence of the treated cells on the
malignant cell without forcing the two treated cells to be identical. We explore
this application in more detail later in the paper.

2.4 Estimating tree-evolving networks

When the network is tree—evolving, our goal is to learn the structure
of a tree—varying GGM, which is a special case of the general varying—
coefﬁcient varying—structure (VCVS) model studied in Kolar et al. (2009).
This formulation allows us to formally encode the topology of the network
into the parameters pm) of the model; for example, the absence of an edge
between nodes u and v in cell type n, corresponds to the partial correlation
coefﬁcient ,0)? = 0.

Thus, in our formulation, recovering the structure of the N gene regulatory
networks in the cell genealogy can be done by estimating pm) for each
1 5 n 5 N .1 Our goal is to capture the sharp differences (i.e. edge re—rewiring),
rather than small correlation changes, in the tree evolving network. As a
result, we concentrate on recovering the correct edge set 80” rather than on
the exact values of p(”), although these are attainable as a side product of
our algorithm.

In line with this goal, we make three assumptions:

0 Sparsity: most of the ,0)? are zero, leading to graphs with few edges.

 

1Note that this is technically not the pairwise potential function in a GGM

° Sparsity of change: the edge set 80” is similar to that of its parent
50101)).

0 Sharpness of change: there do exist a few key differences between 80”
and 80701)) that must be captured.

These assumptions hold in a wide variety of biological applications.
Sparsity is usually well justiﬁed. For example, a transcription factor controls
(and is controlled by) only a few genes under speciﬁc conditions (Davidson,
2001). A sparsity bias can effectively prevent estimating all elements in p(”)
to be non—zero, which leads to a meaningless complete graph. Similarly, in
many biological processes the gene regulatory network in the parent cell
type and the one in the child often contain only a few, but sharp differences.
For example, if the parent network is a malignant cancer cell and the child
networks are treated cancer cells with various drugs, we expect that the
treated and cancer cells should have largely similar networks due to close
developmental relationship. However, the genes that are affected by the drug
should behave dramatically differently, causing a few large changes in the
regulatory networks.

It is important to reiterate here that estimating networks for each cell
type separately and independently is either invalid or extremely error—prone,
because in common laboratory conditions only a few measurements of the
gene expression are obtained, leading to either degeneracy of the likelihood
function or high variance in the estimator. We overcome this problem by
enabling information sharing across different cell types through a joint
estimation of all networks under a single loss function, as opposed to a
loss function deﬁned on each individual network.

To estimate p(1),...,p(”) jointly, we adopt the neighborhood selection idea
described previously, and additionally penalize the difference between the
neighborhoods of adjacent cell types in the genealogy. More speciﬁcally, to
recover the neighborhood of gene u for all cell types jointly, we propose
the following convex optimization problem for estimating tree evolving
networks.

In Equation (6), xu refers to the realization of variable X 5/”). The (51 penalty
associated with Al enforces sparsity by setting most of the edge weights to

with M enforces sparsity of difference and encourages most of the elements

n=ls=l

of 00:!) to be identical to those of 0%,”) along the genealogy. However, since
the 151 instead of the [52 penalty is used, outliers are not strongly penalized,
allowing for large differences for a small set of edges. This allows us to
have a large amount of information sharing among samples from related
regulatory networks, while still allowing sharp differences to capture key
changes as the network evolves.

One complication that results from the above approach is that since each
neighborhood is estimated independently and because the regularization
encourages some of the coefﬁcients to be zero, the sign of 93:) is not
guaranteed to equal the sign of 93;) for ﬁnite sample sizes. This makes
directly using Equation (5) to estimate the partial correlation coefﬁcients
difﬁcult. One common way to address is ‘max’ symmetrization, which is
deﬁned below.

(93;? : 11:91 < 193221 (7)

We can now deﬁne our estimate of the partial correlation coefﬁcients using

Equation (5)2.

The estimated edge set is then deﬁned as:
5*") = {(w): 15391 > 0}. (9)

The total variation penalty makes this algorithm signiﬁcantly different
from KELLER (Song et al., 2009a). KELLER uses kernel reweighting
to recover smoothly evolving networks where the correlations between
genes are changing gradually over time. However, in both the stem cell
evolution and breast cancer progression—reversion problems that motivate
us, the networks are evolving sharply at some points while remaining almost
constant in others. For example, different microarray measurements taken
from a blood stem cell renewing itself while remaining in the undifferentiated
state are expected to exhibit almost the same correlations among the genes.
However, once the blood stem cell evolves into a myleoid or lymphoid
stem cell as shown in Figure 1, we expect there to be sharp changes in the
regulatory network reﬂecting the new function of the more specialized cell.
This sudden change can be effectively captured by the TV penalty in our
algorithm but not by the kernel reweighting of KELLER. In this way, our
algorithm is similar to that of TESLA (Ahmed and Xing, 2009) which also
uses a TV penalty to estimate time evolving networks (a chain of graphs).
However, our algorithm generalizes this idea to tree—evolving networks
which are more suitable for investigating a wider range of biological
processes. Algorithmically, the genealogy—induced TV penalty deﬁnes more
complex constraints on the model space than that of TESLA, where network
structures should be inferred. It also uses a GGM approach, and thus involves
a linear regression, instead of the binary MRF approach of TESLA, which
involves a logistic regression. We believe that the GGM approach, which
allows for continuous measurements, is more suitable for our breast cancer
application, because the sample size is small.

2.5 Optimization

We employed the CVX solver (Grant et al., 2008) provided in MATLAB to
solve the underlying convex optimization problem for tree—evolving network
estimation under our proposed model. At its core, CVX uses the SPDT3
solver (Toh et al., 1999). SPDT3 is an interior point method for solving
conic programming problems, where the constraints are convex cones, and
the objective function is linear (plus the log—barrier terms for the constraints).

For larger scale problems, one can use the method proposed by Chen et al.
(2010) that uses the accelerated gradient method.

3 SIMULATION RESULTS

To assess the performance of Treegl, we evaluated its performance on
simulated microarray data with a known topology of the underlying tree—
evolving network. Consider the following artiﬁcial tree evolving network
with N = 70:

(1) A graph A with 30 nodes, average degree 4, and max degree 6
is generated from a Gaussian Graphical Model. For the ﬁrst 10
generations, i.e. n=1 to 10, A remains unchanged. However, we
assume that each of these generations correspond to a different cell
type in the genealogy (for reasons that will be made clear later).

(2) After n: 10, the graph branches into two child graphs, B and C. To
generate each child graph, 25% of the edges are randomly deleted and
the same number are randomly added. This represents a sharp, sparse
change in the network. These child graphs stay unchanged for another
10 generations (n=11 to 20 for B, n=21 to 30 for C). Again, each
generation indicates a different cell type.

(3) B and C then branch further. 25% of the edges are randomly

removed/added to generate graphs D and E from B, and F and
G from C. The resulting graphs then stay constant for another

 

 

2Note that the symmetrization may not make this a good estimate of the

magnitude of pill), but it is an accurate estimate of whether or not ,0)? is

positive, negative, or zero, which is all we need to recover the network
structure.

Note that our algorithm does not know at which points the network structure
changes. Our goal is to examine if it can detect the change—points as well
as take advantage of the samples that come from cell types with identical
structure between the change points.

To evaluate Treegl, we plot a ROC curve showing the recall for

To produce the curve, cross validation is used to select Al and 12. A
threshold t is then varied from the smallest absolute edge weight to the
largest absolute edge weight. An edge is included in the network if and
only if it has an edge weight greater than t (in absolute value). We calculate
precision/recall for a large number of values of t and produce the curve. To
average different trials, we used binning, averaging points using a bin width
of 0.05.

The results are shown in Figure 2 for two different sample sizes. Our
method (in blue) performs favorably to estimating a single static network
(green) or estimating each graph independently (red). It should be noted
that our method can produce different graphs compared to the static method
which only produces one. The independent method also produces different
graphs but it performs very poorly.

4 AN APPLICATION TO BREAST CANCER DATA

We now demonstrate an application of our algorithm to the study
of progression and reversion of breast cancer cells. Pioneered by
Dr Mina Bissell’s research team, functional analysis of physiologically more
realistic 3D culture models of breast cancer has yielded a wealth of insight
into the mechanisms of cancer development (Petersen et al., 1992). From
tumor cells cultured in 3D matrices, it was found that microenvironmental
factors and signaling inhibitors have a dramatic inﬂuence on the growth
dynamics and malignancy of the cells (Itoh et al., 2007; Weaver et al.,
1997). Further, tumorigenicity of breast cancer cells is tightly linked to the
integrity of their acinar structures (Petersen et al., 1992). However, except for
a sketchy outline, little is known about how the cells interpret signaling cues
from their surroundings and selectively regulate genes in a temporal—spatially
speciﬁc manner.

Our goal is to investigate the gene regulatory networks of normal breast
cells (81 cells), malignant breast cancer cells (T4 cells), and nontumorigenic
breast cancer cells reverted by different drugs (T4R cells). The exact tree—
genealogy underlying these cell—type speciﬁc networks is shown in Figure 3:
SI cells with polarized acinar structures evolve into tumorigenic T4 cells
which form disorganized apolar colonies, and then three drugs are applied
individually to T4 cells and different reverted cells (T4R) with organized
structures which resemble Sl cells are produced.

4.1 Experimental setup

We have 15 microarray measurements of 22 000 genes detailed below, that
we grouped into ﬁve categories of three samples each (based on their
similarities): three samples of SI cells, three samples of T4 cells, three
samples of T4R cells reverted by MMP inhibitors (later referred to as MMP—
T4R), three samples of T4R cells reverted by either PI3K or MAPKK
inhibitors (PI3K—MAPKK—T4R) and three samples of T4R cells reverted
by either EGFR or integrin B1 inhibitors (EGFR—ITGBl—T4R).

Our experimental procedure started with feature selection to reduce
noise. Since some probes on Affymetrix arrays have multiple replicates,
we combined measurements from these probes by taking the median, which
resulted in 12 977 unique genes. Next, for each gene we calculated its median
fold ratios of expression levels among each pair of the ﬁve groups of cells.
If any of the fold ratios for a gene was greater than 1.3, it was selected for
the next step. We picked 5440 genes using this criterion.

Then, we applied T reegl to the 5440 genes. In addition to taking advantage
of the similarity between the T4 and T4R networks, we also explicitly
penalize the difference between the SI and T4R networks, since the T4R
networks are expected to lie somewhere in between the SI and T4. As a
result, we add extra TV penalty terms between the T4R and SI to enforce this
intuition (dotted lines in Fig. 3). These extra penalty terms are assigned the
same parameter M as the other total variation penalties. The new optimization
problem is given below (n=1 corresponds to SI, n=2 corresponds to T4,
and n = 3, 4, 5 correspond to the T4R).

Finally, functional analysis was performed to examine genes in the
identiﬁed networks. We focused our analysis on the genes in the networks
which are distinct in each of the ﬁve groups of cell types and have positive
edges. To investigate how genes involved in different biological processes
interact with each other in the recovered networks, we ﬁrst classiﬁed the
genes in the networks into the second level Gene Ontology (GO) groups, then
we used TVNViewer (http://cogito—b.ml.cmu.edu/tvnviewer/) to visualize
interactions between these functional groups (Curtis et al., 2011). Moreover,
the GOstat program (Beissbarth and Speed, 2004) was employed to identify
signiﬁcantly enriched functional groups in the identiﬁed networks. Fisher’s
exact test was used by GOstat to ﬁnd overrepresented functional groups
among a given list of genes. Our gene universe consisted of all 12 977 genes
on the arrays. A functional group was considered signiﬁcant if its P < 0.10

also used the GOstat program to ﬁnd GO groups enriched in the subnetworks
of T4 cells. A functional group was selected if its P < 0.10.

5 ANALYSIS OF RESULTS

5.1 Results overview

Figure 4 gives an overview of all the recovered networks using
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003). As one can see the networks
exhibit many different topologies reﬂecting their underlying
biological differences. To shed more light on these differences,
Figure 5 shows the interactions among the second level GO groups
in the recovered networks. The thickness of a link between two
groups is proportional to the number of edges present between genes
that are members of these GO groups. T4 cells display increased
activities in cell proliferation and signaling, both indicative of their
malignant state, compared to S1 cells. The T4R cells lie somewhere
in between: MMP—T4R cells tend to have only a few interactions,
since the network is quite sparse. While both the PI3K—MAPKK—
T4R and EGFR—ITGBl networks show reduced activities in growth
and locomotion compared to S1 cells, the former network has more
activities in cell proliferation and reduced signaling than the latter
one. Taken together, these data suggest that although T4 cells can be
morphologically reverted back to the normal—looking T4R cells, the
underlying molecular mechanisms in the reverted cells are different
from those in either S1 or T4 cells.

5.2 GO analysis of networks

Next, we performed GO analysis to discover signiﬁcantly enriched
functional groups speciﬁc to each network. Our results are illustrated
in Table 1.

Our data shows that highly enriched GO groups in S1 cells
correspond to metabolic processes or other housekeeping functions,
such as cellular respiration and DNA replication, reﬂecting the
normal nature of these cells. On the other hand, T4 cells are
enriched with genes involved in cell proliferation, growth factor
activity, intracellular signaling cascade, angiogenesis and actin
binding group, all of which are known to play important roles in
T4 as well as other cancer cells (Hanahan et al., 2000; Liu et al.,
2004; Wang et al., 2002; Weaver et al., 1997). These results show
that our algorithm is able to reveal what has already been known
about S1 and T4 cells, and thus demonstrate the validity of our
method.

Since little is known about T4R cells, we next examined
the networks of the different T4R cells to gain more insight
into these reverted cells. Our results show that the MMP—
T4R network, like S1 cells, contains many enriched GO groups
involved in metabolic processes, such as fatty acid and cofactor
metabolic processes. On the other hand, however, the PI3K—
MAPKK—T4R network contains genes involved mainly in post—
translational protein modiﬁcation, chromatin modiﬁcation, thiolester
hydrolase activity and vacuole, while the EGFR—ITGBl—T4R
network is predominantly overrepresented with genes participating
in chromatin modiﬁcation, cytoskeletal protein binding, intracellular
junctions, among others. These data therefore suggest that at the
molecular level T4R cells are indeed different from S1 and T4 cells,
as well as from one another.

5.3 Analysis of Hubs in the T4 network

Finally, to identify potential novel drug targets in T4 cells, we
examined several hubs which have high degrees as well as their
neighborhood genes in these cells. Figure 6 shows the subnetworks
of 5 hubs: ANXA3, CA9, HSF2BP, PTGS2 and SCG5. As expected,
many of the functional gene groups enriched in the subnetworks
reﬂect our intuition that these hubs interact closely with genes
inﬂuential in cancer.

(1) ANXA3 (degree: 61)—encodes a protein belonging to the
annexin family, and is known to play a role in the regulation
of cell growth and is thought to be a biomarker of cancer (Jung
et al., 2010). In the ANXA3—subnetwork, it interacts with a

number of genes related to cell proliferation, growth factor
activity, and the MAP kinase signaling pathway, the latter of
which is known to be one of the key signaling pathways in
T4 cells (Liu et al., 2004).

(2) CA9 (degree: 37)—encodes carbonic anhydrase IX. It has
been implicated in cell proliferation, and has been found to
be important in renal cell carcinoma (Jubb et al., 2004). We
see that CA9’s neighborhood consists of genes involved in
cell proliferation, the MAP kinase signaling pathway, golgi
apparatus part, and transcription factor activity.

(3) HSF2BP (degree: 80)—encodes heat shock transcription
factor binding protein. Like the previous two hubs, HSF2BP
has neighbors related to cell proliferation and the MAP kinase
signaling pathway. It also has neighbors related to ‘response
to wounding’ which is known to be linked with tumorigenesis

1998).

(4) PTGSZ (degree: 88)—encodes prostaglandin—endoperoxide
synthase 2, which is a key enzyme in prostaglandin
biosynthesis. Previous evidence suggests that it is associated
with risk of breast cancer (Langsenlehner et al., 2006). Again,
we see neighbors participating in similar activities to the
previous hubs, such as cell proliferation and wound healing.
Another interesting group is cell motility which suggests that
the subnetwork of PTGS2 potentially plays a role in tumor
cell spread (Yamazaki et al., 2005).

(5) SCGS (degree: 78)—encodes secretogranin V, which has
been found to be involved in medullary carcinoma
(Marcinkiewicz et al., 1988) as well as human lung cancer
(Roebroek et al., 1989). Again many of its neighbors are
involved in cell proliferation, response to wound healing,
and cell motility. Another interesting group of neighbors is
those related to GTPase activity; as ras oncogenes happen to
be members of the family of GTPases (Sahai and Marshall,
2002), this group of genes may also have activities implicated
in cancer.

In summary, these results suggest that hubs with high degrees
in the T4 network contribute to the growth, proliferation, and
malignancy of T4 cells, and thus may serve as potential novel targets
for breast cancer treatment.

6 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Statistically and algorithmically, the problem of estimating tree—
evolving networks from multiple biological systems in the
genealogy simultaneously, as solved by Treegl, is fundamentally
different from estimating multiple networks separately from every
cell type, or estimating a single ‘average’ network from samples
pooled from all cell—types (or all cell stages) in the genealogy
and subsequently ‘trace—out’ active subnetworks corresponding to
each cell—type from the average network (Luscombe et al., 2004),
which are common practices in current system biology community.
The latter two approaches either directly or indirectly assume that

Reconstructing tree-evolving gene networks

 

the network in question is a static one, and samples of nodal
states, such as microarray measurements of gene expressions are
i.i.d. within or (when pooled) across cell types. In reality, such
an assumption is not only biologically invalid, but is statistically
unsubstantiated and hard to leverage. First, such an assumption can
lead to severe underuse of the data, and makes an already serious
curse—of—dimensionality problem even harder for the following
reason. Typically, in many gene expression proﬁling experiments,
especially those from biomedical studies, the size of the sample
can be extremely small (e.g. often 2—3 replica per condition or
specimen) compared to the number of genes (typically 103 —104
for human) due to the difﬁculty of procuring many samples in
laboratory experiments, which makes the directly estimated network
over these genes extremely unreliable. In reality, these different cell
types at different positions in the genealogy should not be drastically
different, and one should expect that samples from closely related
types may offer additional information to the cell type in question.
Thus, estimating each point in the genealogy independently using
a static reverse engineering algorithm would be largely ineffective,
because there is not enough data and there are too many variables.
Next, due to the presence of the genealogy that related all cell—type—
speciﬁc networks, the samples from all types are not identically
distributed. Therefore when naively pooling them together to obtain
an average network, the result may suffer from high variance,
since the regulatory network could change signiﬁcantly from the
beginning to the end of the genealogy. The Treegl algorithm elegantly
couples all the inference problems pertained to each network in the
genealogy, and achieves a globally optimal and statistically well
behaving solution based on a principled VCVS model and a convex
optimization formulation.

To demonstrate our method, we applied our algorithm to a
microarray dataset obtained from a progression and reversion series
of breast cancer cells. Our results showed that we not only were
able to identify previously known molecular signatures speciﬁc to
different cell types, but also that we could provide deeper insight
into the unknown molecular mechanisms underlying these cells, and
therefore demonstrating the strength of our method.

Some important future directions are to consider genealogies other
than a tree, and network representations beyond undirected Gaussian
Graphical Models, such as a Bayesian network which is directed and
can offer causal insight into the gene interactions.

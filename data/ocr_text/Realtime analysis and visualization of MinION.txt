Abstract

Motivation: The recently released Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing platform presents many in—
novative features opening up potential for a range of applications not previously possible. Among
these features, the ability to sequence in real—time provides a unique opportunity for many time—crit—
ical applications. While many software packages have been developed to analyze its data, there is
still a lack of toolkits that support the streaming and real—time analysis of MinION sequencing data.
Results: We developed npReader, an open—source software package to facilitate real—time analysis
of MinION sequencing data. npReader can simultaneously extract sequence reads and stream
them to downstream analysis pipelines while the samples are being sequenced on the MinION
device. It provides a command line interface for easy integration into a bioinformatics work flow,
as well as a graphical user interface which concurrently displays the statistics of the run. It also
provides an application programming interface for development of streaming algorithms in order
to fully utilize the extent of nanopore sequencing potential.

Availability and implementation: npReader is written in Java and is freely available at https://

1 Introduction

The recent introduction of the Oxford Nanopore MinION sequenc—
ing platform has added a new dimension into genomics sequencing.
The platform can read ultra long DNA segments due to the ability
to directly sense DNA fragments with biological nanopores without
the need of amplification. Its portability also proves useful to many
studies under critical conditions such as disease outbreaks and field
work. A number of labs around the world have been evaluating the
platform through the MinION Access Programme (MAP), and have
also used the platform to develop numerous novel applications.

One of the most innovative features of the Oxford Nanopore
MinION platform is that it can output sequence reads in real—time, i.e.
the electrical current data and the base—called sequence of a DNA frag—
ment can be obtained as soon as it passed through the nanopore. This is
attractive for many time critical applications such as rapid infection

diagnosis. While several excellent software packages (e.g. Loman and
Quinlan 2014; Watson et al. 2015 were introduced as soon as the
MinION devices were released, there is still a lack of tools supporting
the extraction and analysis of MinION sequence data in real—time.

We developed npReader, an open—source software package to
facilitate real—time analysis of Oxford Nanopore MinION sequenc—
ing data. npReader is written in Java and hence can run seamlessly
on any platforms with minimal dependency. It provides a flexible
and comprehensible command line interface, allowing it to be easily
incorporated into an analysis pipeline. In addition, it provides a
Graphical User Interface (GUI) for users to visually assess the statis—
tics of the run. The package also provides a Java Application
Programming Interface (API) allowing developers to extract both
based—called sequences and native electrical current data to further
develop algorithms for other analyses.

Realtime analysis and visualization of MinION sequencing data

2 Methods

A MinION device can sequence an array of DNA fragments in parallel.
As the DNA fragment translocates through a pore and changes the elec—
trical charge of the pore, the electrical current is captured. The sequence
of electrical signal is then translated (base—called) to a possible DNA
sequence by the cloud—based Metrichor suite. The various types of data
for the fragment, including the native electrical events, event timings
and base—called sequence, are stored in a FAST5 format file.

As soon as a DNA fragment is sequenced by the MinION and base—
called by the Metrichor cloud, npReader opens the FAST5 file contain-
ing the sequence read, extracts the desired information for an initial
analysis, and streams the sequence read in FASTA or FASTQ format to
one or more real—time analysis pipelines such as that in (Cao et 61].,
2015). These pipelines can be run on the same computer or on comput—
ing clouds. This will extend the range of applications one can analyze in
real—time beyond what currently provided by the Metrichor service.

npReader provides a comprehensible and ﬂexible command line
interface, thus can be easily integrated into any existing bioinfor-
matics workflow. From the command line, users can specifically
select sequence reads that are suitable for the downstream analysis,
such as reads with a certain length and quality. The package also
contains tools for further binning reads based on their type, length
and quality. npReader can also run in GUI mode, enabling the use
of pointing devices. Under GUI mode, npReader can concurrently
gather and display useful statistics for the current run (See Fig. 1).
The plots of these statistics are highly customizable and can be
exported to an image format ready for publication.

npReader is developed in Java. The package includes all the
necessary libraries, such as that for statistical analysis and visualiza—
tion, hence requires minimal dependency. Apart from the Java
Runtime Environment, the only extra dependency is the HDF5
library which is the core for FAST5 format. As a Java application,
npReader can run seamlessly cross platforms including Linux,
Windows and OSX and hence allows users to run on the laptop

connecting to the MinION device or on high performance comput—
ing clusters and computing clouds.

Following the recent Oxford Nanopore announcements of their
upcoming sequencing platforms, PromethION and GridION, we
recognized the need for the development of streaming algorithms to
analyze large volumes of sequencing data in real—time. To support
this, npReader provides a Java application programming interface
to allow researchers to simultaneously retrieve base—called sequences
as well as the raw Nanopore event data. The following code snippet
demonstrates the extraction of the two dimensional sequence and
the event sequence from a FAST5 file within a Java program.

import j apsa . seq . nanopore . NanoporeReader;

NanoporeReader reader
: new NanoporeReader (fileName) ;
reader.readData();
reader.close();
//Get 2D read
Fasthequence read2D :reader . getSeq2D () ;
//Get the squiggle signals
DetectedEvents events : reader . getEvents () ;

3 Discussion

The npReader package provides a simple and yet powerful solution for
analysis of MinION sequencing data in real—time. It provides a GUI to
allow users to visually examine quality statistics of a run when a DNA
sample is being sequenced. Importantly, it can extract the desired infor—
mation from the run simultaneously and stream into multiple down—
stream analysis pipelines on high performance computing facilities or
on computing clouds, thereby facilitating real—time analysis of the DNA
sample. This will allow answering the biological questions at hand in a
timely manner, and as soon as sufficient data are obtained.

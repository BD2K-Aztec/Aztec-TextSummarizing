ABSTRACT

Motivation: Small RNA sequencing and degradome sequencing (also
known as parallel analysis of RNA ends) have provided rich informa-
tion on the microRNA (miRNA) and its cleaved mRNA targets on a
genome-wide scale in plants, but no computational tools have been
developed to effectively and conveniently deconvolute the
miRNA—target interaction (MTI).

Results: A freely available package, MTide, was developed by com-
bining modified miRDeep2 and CleaveLand4 with some other useful
scripts to explore MTI in a comprehensive way. By searching for
targets of a complete miRNAs, we can facilitate large-scale identifica-
tion of miRNA targets, allowing us to discover regulatory interaction
networks.

1 INTRODUCTION

microRNAs (miRNAs) are a kind of small endogenous non-
coding RNAs that negatively control gene expression at the
post-transcriptional level by degrading target mRNAs in plants
(Bartel, 2009). To make the functions of miRNA totally clear, it
is essential to exactly identify the conserved and species-speciﬁc
miRNAs and their target genes. Small RNA sequencing and
degradome sequencing have been widely used in plants to iden-
tify miRNAs and target genes on a genome-wide scale. Many
tools have been developed to handle small RNA sequencing and
degradome data separately, but no specialized tool exists for a
one-stop survey of this kind of interaction.

miRNAs are cleaved from stem-loop structured precursors
called pre-miRNAs by Dicer-like l (Kurihara and Watanabe,
2004). Maturation of miRNAs releases RNA fragments derived
from different parts of pre-miRNAs with asymmetric abun-
dance. miRDeep2 (Friedlander et al., 2012), a new version of
miRDeep, uses the position and frequency of sequenced reads
along with the secondary structure of pre-miRNAs and uses a
probabilistic model of miRNA biogenesis in animals to score the
possible miRNA sequence. Compared with animals, miRNA
precursors are much longer with more variable lengths and
more miRNAs belong to paralogous families with multiple

members in plants (Yang and Li, 2011). Therefore, it cannot
be applied to the plant systems straightforward (Thakur et al.,
2011).

CleaveLand (Addo-Quaye et al., 2009) was developed specif-
ically to analyze degradome data. However, because of the algo-
rithms implemented in it, it is impractical to analyze all possible
miRNA—target interactions (MTIs) in a reasonable timescale for
miRNAs identified from small RNA sequencing data. Moreover,
it only reports targets cleaved between the 10th and 11th nucleo-
tides, but cleavages between 9th and 10th or 11th and 12th nt
have also been reported (Allen et al., 2005; Jagadeeswaran et al.,
2009).

Here, we present MTide, an integrated tool for exploring MTI
in plants. It consists of a modified miRDeep2 with plant-speciﬁc
parameters, a modified CleaveLand4 with more targets reports
and some other useful scripts. To control the running timescale
in a low level, we add multiple threads support for miRDeep2,
CleaveLand4 and other time-consuming parts.

2 FEATURES

Based on deep sampling of small RNA libraries and degradome
fragments of target mRNA by next-generation sequencing,
MTide enables users to explore expression patterns of known
miRNA genes, discover novel ones and identify target mRNA
of these miRNAs. Figure 1 illustrates the workﬂow of MTide. It
is composed of four modules, which are listed below:

0 Module 1: miRNA identification

First, the small RNA sequencing reads are processed by
removing 5’ and 3’ adaptors, discarding reads that are
<18 nt or >30 nt and parsing them into FASTA format
with their copy number recorded. Second, the cleaned
reads are mapped to other non-coding libraries, such as
RFam, RepBase and CDS sequences, to remove mRNA,
rRNA, tRNA, snRNA, snoRNA and other non-coding
RNAs. Third, the preprocessed reads are mapped to
genome sequences using Bowtie (Langmead et al.,
2009) with not more than two mismatches and 15 valid
alignments allowed. The mapping result file will be
transformed to ‘arf’ format, which was introduced by
miRDeep2. Finally, the re-parameterized miRDeep2 is
invoked. The length of sequences for predicting RNA
secondary structure is set to 250, and a plant-speciﬁc

scoring system is added to miRDeep2. The overall steps
quantify the known miRNA expression and identify
novel ones with stem-looped precursors.

0 Module 2: miRNA target identification

To make target searching time efficient, we only consider
mRNA having degradome signature while running
GSTAr.pl, which is a core script in CleaveLand4 pack-
age. To find more targets, we add support for cleavages
between 9th and 10th or 11th and 12th nt of the miRNA
sequences, as suggested by SeqTar (Zheng et al., 2012).

0 Module 3: miRNA target prediction

TAPIR is one of the most precise tools for miRNA target
prediction in plants (Bonnet et al., 2010). Here, we use
the ‘precise search’ option of TAPIR and add multiple
threads support for it.

0 Module 4: prioritization of the predicted target

The targets of the same miRNA tend to share similar
functions. To remove false-positive targets predicted by
TAPIR, all the targets are scored based on GO similarity
to targets of the same miRNA identified from degradome
data.

We also have developed an integrated script including all mod-
ules listed above, and users can run this script just by modifying
the accompanying conﬁgure ﬁle. In case of two small RNA
sequencing samples, Mtide provides an option for differential
expression analysis of known miRNA using DESeq (Anders
and Huber, 2010).

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The MTide package was developed in Perl by combining the core
algorithm of miRDeep2 and CleaveLand4, cutadapt (Martin,
2011) for adaptor removing, Bowtie for reads mapping and the
Vienna RNA package for RNA secondary structure prediction.
If users want to prioritize the predicted targets based on GO
similarity and do differential expression analysis of miRNA,
two R packages, csbl.go (Ovaska et al., 2008) and DESeq,
should also be installed. All the scripts can be executed
sequentially or by an integrated script MTide.pl in a com-
mand-line environment. The package has been tested on two
Linux platforms, Ubuntu 12.14 and Fedora 8, and should
work on similar systems that support Perl and R. The package
and user manual can be obtained from http://bis.zju.edu.cn/
MTide.

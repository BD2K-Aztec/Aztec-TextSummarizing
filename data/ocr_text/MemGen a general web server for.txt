Abstract

Motivation: Molecular dynamics simulations provide atomic insight into the physicochemical char—
acteristics of lipid membranes and hence, a wide range of force field families capable of modelling
various lipid types have been developed in recent years. To model membranes in a biologically
realistic lipid composition, simulation systems containing multiple different lipids must be
assembled.

Results: We present a new web service called MemGen that is capable of setting up simulation sys—
tems of heterogenous lipid membranes. MemGen is not restricted to certain lipid force fields or
lipid types, but instead builds membranes from uploaded structure files which may contain any
kind of amphiphilic molecule. MemGen works with any all—atom or united—atom lipid
representation.

Availability and implementation: MemGen is freely available without registration at http://memgen.

1 Introduction

Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid membranes have
come of age. Since the first simulation of a bilayer membrane more
than 30 years ago (Van der Ploeg and Berendsen, 1982), MD simula-
tions have been used to study various processes at atomic or near—
atomic resolutions such as lipid diffusion, solute permeation,
electroporation, undulation and phase transition. In addition, they
are required to provide a realistic environment for simulations of
membrane proteins. To this end, a range of lipid force fields have
been developed which reproduce membrane parameters such as the
area per lipid, order parameters and X—ray scattering factors.
Atomistic lipid force fields can be separated into united—atom (Berger
et 61]., 1997; Chiu et 61]., 2009; Piggot et 61]., 2011; Ulmschneider and
Ulmschneider, 2009) and all—atom force fields (Dickson et 61]., 2012;
Jambeck and Lyubartsev, 2012; Maciejewski et 61]., 2014; Pastor and
MacKerell, Jr., 2011), which differ in the modelling of apolar hydro-
gen atoms. Hence, force field development is an active field of

research, and more force field families covering a wider range of lipid
types are expected to be published in the near future.

More recently, because biological membranes contain thousands
of different lipid types, the interest in simulations of heterogenous
membranes has increased (Rog et 61]., 2009; Zocher et 61]., 2013).
Setting up such heterogenous membranes can be tedious. Upon build—
ing such membranes, atomic overlaps between neighbouring lipids
must be strictly avoided. Otherwise, minimizing the energy of the
sytem fails, leading to numerical instabilities in the first simulation
steps. To our knowledge, two web services have so far been de—
veloped to facilitate the setup of membrane simulation systems,
namely CHARMM—GUI and Membuilder (Ghahremanpour et 61].,
2014; Jo et 61]., 2009). These services allow the user to choose from a
list of lipid types and force fields, which are kept on their respective
servers. Hence, these services require frequent maintenance upon
publication of new lipid types and force fields. In addition, they do
not allow the insertion of molecules that are not available server—side.

Following an alternative approach, we present the new web ser—
ver MemGen that automatically sets up lipid membrane simulation
systems. The server is not restricted to certain force fields, lipid
types, or specific MD simulation software. The user uploads one
or more lipid structure files (http://memgen.uni—goettingen.de).
Alternatively, any amphiphilic molecule such as an alcohol or deter—
gent may be uploaded. Subsequently, the server generates a compact
representation of each lipid that is aligned along the z—axis (Fig. 1A),
to avoid atomic overlaps in the assembled membrane. After building
the membrane with the requested molar fractions of each lipid, the
server hydrates the membrane with a requested number of water
molecules per lipid. Eventually, counter ions and, optionally, so—
dium chloride is added (Fig. 1B). The final structure is provided for
download in PDB format, which can be processed by any MD
software.

2 Methods

In order to generate a compact representation of an uploaded lipid,
a force field topology of the lipids is required. To this end, MemGen
builds a GAFF topology of each lipid using ACPYPE, which builds
upon the Antechamber software (da Silva and Vranken, 2012;
Wang et 61]., 2004, 2006). Because GAFF requires an all—atom repre-
sentation, hydrogen atoms are added with Open Babel if the user up—
loads a united—atom lipid (O’Boyle et al., 2011). By analysing the
bond structure of the lipid, MemGen detects the terminal atoms of
the lipid tails, as well as a central head group atom. Subsequently,
using the Gromacs simulation software and applying a combination
of simulated annealing, constant—force pulling on the head group
and tail atoms, as well as position—restraining potentials, a highly

compact representation of the lipid is created (Fig. 1A) (Pronk et 61].,
2013). Hydrogen atoms added by Open Babel are removed.

A lipid monolayer is generated by placing the compact representa—
tions of the lipids on a square grid, and two such monolayers are
assembled to build the bilayer (Fig. 1B). To release some strain from
the highly ordered lipids, a 1.2—picosecond simulation is conducted at
300 Kelvin with position—restraining potentials on the terminal tail
atoms. The requested number of water molecules per lipid are added.
The charge of the lipid is determined by counting the number of amine,
phosphate and carboxyl groups. Accordingly, counter ions are added
to neutralize the simulation cell. If requested, additional salt is added.

3 Discussion

We tested MemGen using lipids from a wide range of all—atom and
united—atom force fields, including various sterol, detergent and al—
cohol molecules (see Supporting Discussion). Tested lipids contained
between one and six lipid tails and different head group types. The
energy minization and equilibration of the systems were numerically
stable. An example is shown in supplementary Figure S1 in the sup—
porting material. It is important to note that MemGen provides a
highly ordered and hence, unphysical initial configuration, which re-
quires careful equilibration for at least 10 nanoseconds. MemGen
does not provide or maintain lipid force field files. These must be
taken from the force field developers’ web sites, or from repositories
such as LipidBook (Domanski et 61]., 2010).

By design, MemGen does not generate asymmetric bilayers with
differing compositions of the two monolayers. Because the areas per
lipid are not additive in lipid mixtures, it is difficult to predict the
equilibrated membrane area of some lipid mixtures. However, since
membranes are nearly incompressible, any area mismatch between
the two monolayers results in large lateral pressures. To set up such
asymmetric membranes, the user may first equilibrate two symmet—
ric systems, removing an appropriate number of lipids manually to
achieve the same equilibrium area, and subsequently merge one leaf—
let from each simulation (Gurtovenko and Vattulainen, 2008).

ABSTRACT

Summary: Pairs of individuals from a study cohort will often share
long-range haplotypes identical-by-descent. Such haplotypes are
transmitted from common ancestors that lived tens to hundreds of
generations in the past, and they can now be efficiently detected in
high-resolution genomic datasets, providing a novel source of infor-
mation in several domains of genetic analysis. Recently, haplotype
sharing distributions were studied in the context of demographic in-
ference, and they were used to reconstruct recent demographic
events in several populations. We here extend the framework to
handle demographic models that contain multiple demes interacting
through migration. We extensively test our formulation in several
demographic scenarios, compare our approach with methods based
on ancestry deconvolution and use this method to analyze Masai sam-
ples from the HapMap 3 dataset.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in high-throughput genomic technologies
enable population-wide surveys of genetic variation. Although
exacerbating challenges associated with data handling, this in-
crease in volume and resolution had the effect of exposing new
genomic features, creating the need for new models and compu-
tational tools. Among these new genomic features, identical-by-
descent (IBD) haplotypes have recently emerged as a new source
of information in several genetic applications, ranging from
genotype—phenotype association studies (Browning and
Thompson, 2012; Gusev et al., 2011) to the reconstruction of
recent familial relationships (Huff et al., 2011; Kirkpatrick
et al., 2011), the inference of recent demographic events (Gusev
et al., 2012; Palamara et al., 2012) or the study of natural selec-
tion (Albrechtsen et al., 2010; Han and Abney, 2012).

IBD segments are co-inherited from recent common ancestors
by pairs of individuals and are delimited by historical recombin-
ation events. Such recombination events can now be detected in
cohorts that have been densely genotyped (although not requir-
ing the availability of full sequences), and several methods have
now been developed for efﬁcient IBD detection in large datasets
(Browning and Browning, 2011; Gusev et al., 2009). Although
shared haplotypes are found to be common even across popula-
tions that diverged hundreds of generations ago (Gusev et al.,
2012), the average detectable IBD segment is transmitted from
shared ancestors that lived tens to a few hundreds of generations
before present. Haplotype sharing analysis is, therefore, suitable
to reveal the signature of the relatively recent demographic

events that followed the agricultural revolution, where most clas-
sical methods provide limited insight. Leveraging this property of
IBD, several recent surveys relied on shared haplotypes to ana-
lyze population demographics (Atzmon et al., 2010; Henn et al.,
2012; Lawson and Falush, 2012).

In a recent work (Palamara et al., 2012), we studied several
theoretical quantities of IBD haplotypes, as a function of the
demographic history of a population. We used the derived
framework to infer the demographic history of two populations
with different characteristics: (i) a population that underwent
substantial recent isolation (Ashkenazi Jews) and (ii) a cohort
that deviates from a single population model, with migration
across small demes likely playing an important role in shaping
recent genomic diversity (Kenian Masai). The analytical models
we previously described are limited by the assumption that all the
analyzed samples belong to a single population. Although such
models can be used to provide insights in cases of extreme his-
torical isolation, ﬁne-scale interactions across populations were
frequent in recent history, and the reconstruction of these events
is of great interest for genetic-driven investigation of historical
events (Henn et al., 2010) and genetic analysis at large.

In this article, we propose an extension of the analytical frame-
work described in Palamara et a]. (2012), allowing to explicitly
model the presence of multiple populations that interact through
migration rates. We test our approach on several synthetic popu-
lations with known population size changes and migration rates,
ﬁnding that our model accurately matches the empirical distri-
butions and provides a novel tool for the inference of recent
demographic events that involve multiple interacting demes.
We compare our method with existing approaches based on
the distribution of migrant tracts obtained through ancestry
deconvolution, and we revisit the analysis of the Masai popula-
tion using the presented formulation.

2 METHODS
2.1 Haplotype sharing and demographic history

Here, we provide a brief summary of the formulation developed in
Palamara et a]. (2012), and we invite the reader to refer to that article
for additional details.

At a chosen genomic site, a pair of modern day individuals from a
population will have a common ancestor that lived a number of gener-
ations in the past. Such common ancestor transmits several adjacent sites
along with the one being considered, in a region that is delimited by any
recombination event happening along the lineage between the two indi-
viduals on either side of the locus (Fig. 1), and by chromosome bound-
aries. We deﬁne such non-recombinant region as IBD. Recombination
shortens IBD segments during meiotic transmission, and the genetic
length of shared haplotypes is probabilistically linked to the number of
generations separating two individuals from their most recent common
ancestor. In addition, standard assumptions of coalescent theory
(Kingman, 1982) postulate that when tracing the ancestry of a pair of
individuals back in time, the chance of randomly ﬁnding their common

ancestor is inversely proportional to the effective size of the analyzed
population, with a smaller effective population size resulting on average
on earlier common ancestors. Combining these principles, the length of
IBD segments detected in a cohort of studied individuals can be used to
gain insight into the distribution of coalescent times, which in turn can be
used to gain insight into the effective population size within and across
populations at different time scales.

In the remainder of this article, a population’s effective population size
in a coalescent model will simply be referred to as population size. We
represent the demographic history of the studied population via the
vector 6, which may hold just one parameter in the simplest case of a
constant (Wright—Fisher) population, or several parameters in more com-
plex cases (e.g. current population size, ancestral population size and
duration of an exponential expansion). The probability of the considered
genomic site to be spanned by a shared IBD haplotype of genetic length
comprised in the range R = [u, v] can be expressed as

/p(l|6)dl=// p(l,tmm=t|6)dldt
u u 0

00 v (1)
=[;mWw=ue/pmmm=nwm
u

where p(tmrw = t | 6), in the reminder simply written p(t | 6), represents
the probability of ﬁnding the common ancestor for the considered site at
(continuous) time t in the past, measured in generations; p(l | 1mm, 2 I),
later indicated as p(l | t), represents the probability of a segment spanning
the site to have length I after being transmitted for t generations. In this
model, population size is allowed to arbitrarily change in time. In the
simple case of a Wright—Fisher population of constant size Ne, the co-
alescence probability is simply p(t | 6) = Ne‘le‘We— 1. Recombination
events may happen on either side of the considered locus at an exponen-
tial rate that depends on the number of meiotic events in the lineage to a
common ancestor. p(l | I), therefore, assumes the form of a sum of two
exponential random variables or Erlang-2 distribution: p(l | t) 2 41216—2”
(note that length here is expressed in Morgans). Combining these into
Equation (1) and integrating, we obtain

4N3 (v — u) (u + v + 4Neuv)
(1 + 2Neu)2(1 + 2Nev)2

 

‘fmuem= (@

 

or  p(l | 6) (11 = (lljz‘ijﬁgz for the particular case of R = [u, 00).

As shown in Palamara et a]. (2012), Equation (2) can be used to obtain
a closed form estimator of recent effective population size. Taking the
limit of such estimator for v —> 00, it assumes the form

A 1 — A +01 — A
Ne : fR A fR

2“er
where fR is the average observed fraction of genome shared through
segments longer than a length threshold it (here in morgans).

(3)

The computation of  p(l | 6) (11 allows us to derive several additional
theoretical quantities of IBD sharing. Because of the linearity of the ex-
pectation operator, the average fraction of genome shared through IBD
segments in the length range R is simply ﬂ; =  p(l | 6) (11. The distribu-
tion of the length of a randomly sampled segment shared by the pair of
individuals is obtained as p(s | 6) = (fR/l) X [f5o p(l | 6)/ldl]_1, and it can
be used to compute the expected length of a randomly sampled shared
segment in the chosen length range, S R. For a region of length y, a pair of
individuals is expected to share AR % (y X fR)/SR segments, and the dis-
tribution for the number of shared segments can be modeled as a Poisson
random variable with the aforementioned expectation. Using this infor-
mation, an expression for the variance of the fraction of genome shared in
an interval R can be computed. Finally, the full probability distribution
for the fraction of genome shared by a pair of individuals through seg-
ments in the length range R can also be computed using the previously
described quantities.

The quantity  p(l | 6) (11 is, therefore, central in this formulation, as it
allows expressing a number of different measures of IBD sharing as a
function of demographic history. Furthermore,  p(l | 6) (11 only depends
on 6 through p(t | 6), the probability of a coalescence event in the demo-
graphic scenario 6. If the goal is to infer the demographic parameters in a
model comprising multiple populations, we, therefore, need to express the
coalescence probability p(t | 6), where 6 now includes historical size vari-
ation for multiple populations and migration rates across them.

2.2 IBD distributions in the presence of migration

We begin discussing the case of multiple populations referring to a simple
scenario, where two populations of constant size Ne exchange individuals
at a ﬁxed rate m per individual, per generation (see model in Fig. 2a). We
encode this migration rate using the matrix

H22" 1;)

We consider two individuals, 1' and j, each sampled from either popu-
lation. We trace the ancestors of these individuals at one genomic site and
encode their state (in terms of population their ancestors belong to), using
a vector of dimensionality 2. If individual i is sampled from population 1
and individual j from population 2, for example, the state at generation 0
is known and we write it as v,(0) = (1, 0), vJ-(O) = (0, 1). If both are
sampled from population 1, v,(0) = (1,0), vJ-(O) = (1,0). After I gener-
ations (measured in continuous time), the probability that the ancestor of
individual i at this genomic location belongs to either population is given
by

individuals to be in the same population, in which case coalescence hap-
pens at rate 1/Ne. Formally p(t | m, Ne) = Vi(t)Vj(t)T/Ne, which in this
setting becomes

2.3 The general case

Although the previously discussed case of constant population sizes and
migration rates has a simple formulation and can be used to gain initial
insight into the recent demography of a study cohort, such population
dynamics are oversimpliﬁed and generally unrealistic. Luckily, given a
few reasonable assumptions, population sizes and migration rates can be
allowed to arbitrarily ﬂuctuate in time, still permitting a closed form
computation of  p(l | 6) (11.

Consider two populations whose sizes at generation g are expressed as
N1(g) and N2(g). The rate at which these two populations exchange
individuals can be encoded in a discrete migration matrix

_ 1 — m12(g) m12(g)
M(g) _ ( m21(g) 1 — m21(g)) (11)

where m12(g) represents the probability of an individual migrating from
population 1 to population 2 at generation g (backwards in time). After g
generations, the probability that the ancestor of individual i at a genomic
location belongs to either population is given by the vector
vi(0) 11:20 M(k). Deﬁne the matrix N(g) to be diagonal with 1 /N1 (g)
and 1/N2(g) as its diagonal elements. The probability of coalescence
from generation g — 1 to generation g is then

g g T
cg = [va HM<k)]N<g)[v,-(0) HM(k)] (12)

and the probability of the two individuals to coalesce g generations before
present is

g—l

Equation (13) can be used in Equation (1), in its discrete version, to
compute

v 00 g—1 v
/ p<IIM<g),N(g))dI=Z[cg (I—ck)/ mogul] (14)
u k 1 u

g=1

Note that Equation (14) is general, and we can allow additional demo-
graphic changes to take place. For instance, by setting
N2(g) = 0, m12(g) = 0 and m21(g) = 1 for all g> G, we encode a popu-
lation split that occurred G generations ago. In practice, a pair of popu-
lations will have split a number of generations back in time, and it is,
therefore, convenient to consider models of the kind depicted in
Figure 2b. In this model, a population of constant size Nam splits
G generations in the past, forming two populations of size Nal and
Nag. The size of these two groups then ﬂuctuates in time, to reach a
present size of N51 and N62. During their separation, the populations
exchange individuals at a rate of mm and mzl per generation, per indi-
vidual. Of course, other models can be deﬁned, allowing variable migra-
tion rates, and different population size dynamics.

Inference of historical migration rates

 

For mathematical convenience, it is safe tO assume the ancestral popu-
lation size becomes constant a number Of generations in the past. Models
where the ancestral population size (Nam, in Fig. 2b) is constant from
generation G tO inﬁnity allow for a closed form computation Of Equation
(14), no matter which demographic dynamics take place from generation
0 tO G [see Palamara et a]. (2012) for this expression]. Furthermore,
extremely remote demographic events have negligible impact on shared
haplotypes Of currently detectable lengths (e.g. > 1 cM).

2.4 Simulations, ancestry deconvolution and real data

We tested our framework using extensive simulation Of realistic chromo-
somes under several demographic models, using the GENOME coales-
cent simulator (Liang et al., 2007). For computational convenience, we
set the size Of the simulator’s non-recombinant segments between 0.01
and 0.025 cM, as speciﬁed in Section 3, always using a recombination rate
Of 1cM/Mb. A modiﬁed version Of the simulator was used tO extract
ground truth IBD haplotypes from the simulated genealogies, deﬁned
as non-recombinant segments co-inherited by pairs Of individuals from
their most recent common ancestor. For some Of the simulations, we
inferred shared haplotypes using the GERMLINE software package
(Gusev et al., 2009) on phased genotype data, which were obtained setting
GENOME’s mutation rate tO 1.1 X 10‘8 per base pair (Roach et al.,
2010). Genotypes were post-processed tO mimic the information content
Of array data. TO this extent, we computed the allele frequency spectrum
Of European individuals from the HapMap 3 dataset (Frazer et al., 2007),
using frequency bins Of 2%. We then randomly selected the same prO-
portion Of alleles from the simulated genotypes. We obtained an average
density Of ~ 230 single nucleotide polymorphisms/Mb.

TO compare the proposed IBD-based approach for migration inference
tO the approach Of Gravel (2012), which is based on ancestry deconvo-
lution, we simulated synthetic datasets under several demographic models
and extracted genotype data as previously described. We then ran the
PCAdmix software (Brisbin et al., 2012) with windows Of size 0.3cM and
the genetic map used in the simulations. The output Of PCAdmix was
used tO infer migration rates via the Tracts software package (Gravel,
2012). IBD information was computed in the same datasets running the
GERMLINE software, and the output was used tO infer migration rates
using the DORIS software package, which implements the proposed
framework. Perfectly phased haplotypes were used in input for both
PCAdmix and GERMLINE. Only migration rates were inferred, whereas
all other demographic parameters were set tO the true simulated values
for both Tracts and DORIS.

TO demonstrate the use Of the DORIS framework on real data, we
analyzed 56 trio-phased samples from the HapMap 3 dataset. Phased
genotypes were downloaded from the HapMap 3 webpage at http://
hapmap.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov. IBD haplotypes were extracted using
GERMLINE, as previously described in Palamara et al. (2012).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Constant size and symmetric migration rates

TO test the accuracy Of demographic inference based on the
proposed model, we initially simulated a number Of populations
Of constant size Ne, which exchange individuals at a constant,
symmetric migration rate m, as depicted in the model Of
Figure 2a. We simulated 15 possible sizes Of synthetic popula-
tions, ranging from 2000 tO 30 000 haploid individuals, with in-
crements Of 2000. For each population size, we simulated 11
possible migration values, uniformly chosen between 10—4 and
5 X 10—2. For a total Of 165 datasets, we simulated a chromo-
some Of 300 CM for 500 haploid individuals from each subpopu-
lation and computed IBD sharing within and across populations.

The simulations used non-recombining blocks Of 0.02 CM. This
resolution may introduce small biases in the analysis, which we
found tO be negligible in our previous work. We then used
Equation (10) tO estimate 14% and 1E, with results shown in
Figure 3. TO test the model’s accuracy, for this analysis, we
only considered ground-truth IBD segments extracted from the
synthetic genealogies (see Section 2).

We Obtained a gOOd correspondence between the true popu-
lation size and the size inferred via the estimator Of Equation
(10), with almost perfect correlation shown in Figure 3a. Inferred
migration rates were also close tO the simulated rates, although a
moderate upward bias and higher estimation variance for large
migration rates was Observed in this case (Fig. 3b). In addition tO
using the effective population size estimator Of Equation (10), we
used the estimator previously computed in Palamara et al. (2012)
for the case Of constant population with nO migration, reported
in Equation (3). As expected, the inferred recent effective popu-
lation size was in this case inﬂated by the presence Of migration,
as shown in Figure 4. When migration rates are increased, the
inferred population size quickly approaches the total population
size (in this case 2N6).

3.2 Dynamic size and asymmetric migration rates

We then tested our model’s performance in the more complex
demographic scenario depicted in Figure 2b, where a population
splits intO two subpopulations that grow at different exponential
rates, interacting with asymmetric migration rates. We simulated
a chromosome Of ~ 275 CM for 500 haploid individuals per sub-
population. Simulated non-recombinant blocks had size
0.025 CM. In all simulated scenarios, we kept Nam, ﬁxed tO
10000 haploid individuals, whereas Nal and Nag were kept
ﬁxed at 5000 individuals. For N01 and N02, we simulated all
possible combinations Of sizes between 5000 and 205 000 haploid
individuals, with increments Of 15000 (excluding cases where
N01 2 N02). Note that on average, the simulated values Of N01
were smaller, resulting in higher inference accuracy compared
with N02. For each pair Of population sizes, we simulated
values of mm and m21 using all combinations Of the migration
rates 0.0001, 0.0167, 0.0334 and 0.5.

A total Of 540 synthetic populations were tested. For each
synthetic population, we extracted the average fraction Of
genome shared through haplotypes Of different length intervals
by pairs Of individuals within each population or across popula-
tions. As in our previous work, we used a combination Of inter-
vals Of uniform length and length intervals corresponding tO
quantiles Of the Erlang-2 distribution, which is used in p(l | t).
Inference performance was tested via minimization Of the root-
mean-squared deviation between Observed and predicted average
fraction Of shared genome. Note that a likelihood-based ap-
proach (e.g. considering the number Of shared segments) could
be used based on the quantities derived in Section 2.1. We
scanned several possible values for one parameter at a time, per-
forming a line search while ﬁxing the remaining mOdel param-
eters tO the true simulated value. The results Of this analysis are
reported in Figure 5.

As expected, because Of the large recent effective population
sizes we simulated, the variance Of the inference accuracy was
higher in this scenario, suggesting that more than a single

chromosome for 500 diploid individuals may be required for the
analysis Of these demographics. A single chromosome Of ~ 250
CM sampled in 500 diploid individuals is in fact equivalent for
the purpose Of this inference tO the analysis Of all the autosomal
chromosomes for ~ 150 diploid samples (see Palamara et al.,
2012). Larger population sizes result in lower signal-tO-nOise
ratio for the estimation Of the expected fraction Of genome
shared via IBD segments, and increasing sample size or analyzing
additional chromosomes is expected tO reduce the variance in the
inference performance. Lower accuracy was Observed in the in-
ference Of N02 since, as previously mentioned, this simulated
subpopulation was on average larger. Inferred population sizes

were more accurate in the presence Of low-migration rates (rep-
resented by colors in Fig. 5a and b), as high migration further
reduces the chance Of early coalescent events, exacerbating the
effects Of large population sizes. Overall, nO signiﬁcant bias was
Observed in the recovered parameter values, suggesting our
model provides a gOOd match for the empirical distributions.

3.3 Applicability of the model to genotype data

Although the previous analysis was mainly concerned with test-
ing the model’s accuracy, and it relied on ground-truth IBD
sharing extracted from the simulated genealogies, it is interesting
tO ask whether this approach can be used on genotype data. TO
this extent, we simulated genotypes for the demographic model
Of Figure 2a. We set the population sizes tO 4000 or 12000 dip-
lOid individuals per population, and extracted 300 diploid
sampled from each group. The migration rate was symmetric
and set tO 0.04 per individual, per generation. Chromosomes Of
150 CM were simulated using non-recombinant blocks Of size
0.01 CM, and the synthetic genotypes were post-processed tO re-
produce the density and allele frequency spectrum Of realistic
SNP array data (see Section 2). In addition tO extracting the
ground truth IBD information as previously described, we
inferred IBD haplotypes from the simulated genotypes using
the GERMLINE software. The results suggest that when accur-
ate phase information is available (e.g. for the X Chromosome,
or for trio-phased samples), GERMLINE is able tO recover the
IBD sharing distribution across any pair Of samples with high
ﬁdelity (Fig. 6). However, when the samples were computation-
ally phased using the Beagle software (Browning and Browning,
2007), GERMLINE had an inconsistent performance, accurately
recovering the IBD sharing in the case Of N 24000, whereas
poorly inferring long haplotypes in the case Of N: 12 000. This
suggests that additional care must be taken when analyzing com-
putationally phased data, particularly when analyzing cross-
pOpulation IBD spectra, were the quality Of the inferred IBD

3.4 Real data analysis

TO demonstrate the applicability Of our method tO real data, we
analyzed the HapMap 3 Masai dataset, which was already stu-
died in our previous work using a simulation-based approach.
We here revisit this analysis, using the described analytical
framework.

Cryptic relatedness across individuals in this dataset is
extremely common, and it does not appear tO be because Of
the presence Of occasional outliers among the samples.
Demographic reports are not supportive Of recent population
bottlenecks in this group, which is, though, tO be slowly but

steadily expanding (Coast, 2001). The Masai are a semi-nomadic
people, and individuals Often reside in small communities
(Manyatta) Of tens tO few hundreds Of members. TO study
their demography, we, therefore, use a model where V villages
Of constant size N exchange individuals at a constant and sym-
metric rate m. This model is similar tO the one depicted in
Figure 2a, with symmetric migration rates across several popu-
lations. We assumed that all samples were extracted from the
same village and used the model described in Section 2.3 for
the analysis. We performed a grid search testing migration
rates from 0.01 tO 0.4, with intervals Of 0.01, village sizes from
50 tO 4000 with steps Of 10 and number Of villages from 3 tO 150
with increments Of 1. We also Obtained 95% conﬁdence intervals
for the inferred values using a bootstrap approach, by creating
400 re—samples randomly selecting individuals with replacement,

Fig. 6. We simulated a chromosome Of 150 cM for 600 individuals using
the model in Figure 2a, setting population sizes to 4000 and 12 000 dip-
loid individuals, with a migration rate Of 0.04. IBD sharing was extracted
directly from the simulated genealogy (diamonds), or inferred trough
GERMLINE using perfectly phased (circles) or computationally
phased (triangles) chromosomes

then re—computing the optimal parameters using a gradient-
driven procedure, which was initialized using the parameters
inferred using the original samples (note, however, that small
correlations exist for IBD sharing across individual pairs, and
this method may provide optimistic intervals). Using this ap-
proach, we obtained the following estimates: V: 58 (95% CI:
46—75), N=400 (95% CI 3604170) and m = 0.1 (95% CI 0.09—
0.12).

3.5 Comparison with existing methods

The structure of long-range haplotypes is known to carry rele-
vant information about recent population dynamics, but this
genomic feature has only recently become observable thanks to
the development of modern high-throughput genomic technolo-
gies. As a consequence, methods that rely on a population’s
haplotypic structure to reconstruct demographic events have
only recently arose. A model proposed in Pool and Nielsen
(2009), and recently expanded in Gravel (2012), provides a way
to analyze the distribution of migrant tracts and infer the timing
and intensity of recent migration events. To analyze the distri-
bution of migrant haplotypes, however, ancestry deconvolution
needs to be accurately performed. This typically requires the
availability of two suitable reference populations, which are
required to be sufﬁciently diverged from each other. The
amount of required divergence depends on the speciﬁc method
used for the deconvolution, but in general, this poses signiﬁcant
constraints in terms of the demographic scenarios that can be
analyzed using these methods.

To compare our IBD-based approach with methods based on
ancestry deconvolution, we simulated the demographic scenario
of Figure 7, where two populations split GS generations in the
past, and Ga generations in the past contribute a fraction of
genomes to the creation of a group of admixed individuals,
with probability m and 1 — m, through a unique pulse of migra-
tion. All three population sizes were ﬁxed to either N: 5000 or
N: 10 000, m was set to 0.2 and Ga was 25 in all simulations. We
varied G, from 40 to 600, with increments of 20, and extracted

Fig. 8. We created several simulation genotype datasets using the model
in Figure 7, varying Gs while keeping m = 0.2, Ga 2 25, and using con-
stant populations Of size 5000 or 10000 diploid individuals. We inferred
the value Of m using PCAdmix + Tracts, or GERMLINE + DORIS, here
reported as a function of G,

genotype data on a single 400 CM chromosome for 250 diploid
samples in each of the three extant populations (see Section 2).
We used the output of the PCAdmix software as input for the
Tracts program (Gravel, 2012), and the IBD segments retrieved
by GERMLINE as input for the DORIS software. Note that for
the IBD analysis, we only used the 250 admixed samples and the
250 samples from the population contributing ~ m haplotypes at
generation Ga, whereas the samples from the third population
were ignored. In both cases, we inferred the value of m, setting all
other parameters to the true simulated values, with results shown
in Figure 8.

DORIS performed better on average (mean inferred
m = 0.205, std 0.025), although providing slightly noisy results,
suggesting the need for a larger sample size and/or the analysis of
additional chromosomes. The migration rate inferred by Tracts
(mean m = 0.104, std 0.0233) was strongly biased. We note that
in this setting, Tracts is essentially used to only report the pro-
portion of ancestry inferred by the deconvolution method, which
is the actual source of inaccuracy. Even for populations that
diverged 600 generations in the past (~15 000 years before

present assuming a generation of 25 years), the recovered rate
was substantially lower than the simulated rate. The case of
N 25000 yielded better estimates because of the higher drift
found in smaller populations, which improved the power of
PCAdmix to call migrant tracts. We additionally run the
PCAdmix+Tracts analysis on longer time scales, simulating
values of G, from 200 to 6000, with intervals of 200 generations,
using N: 10 000. Even for several thousand generations since the
split of the reference populations, a small bias was observed
(Fig. 9).

This analysis suggests that although the methods that rely on
ancestry deconvolution are a useful tool for the speciﬁc case of
recently admixed groups arising from strongly diverged popula-
tions, they may not be suitable for the analysis of ﬁne-scale mi-
gration events, such as those that occurred across populations
that split few tens to hundreds of generations in the past. It is,
however, possible that adjusting some of the parameters used for
the GENOME simulations and for the PCAdmix software, or
using other deconvolution methods, the obtained accuracy may
be increased. Furthermore, the development of methods for an-
cestry deconvolution in sequence data, where rare variants are
observable, is expected to substantially increase the power of this
analysis, although the effects of limited population divergence
are likely to still affect the accuracy of methods that do not
explicitly take this aspect into account. An additional difference
to be noted between the two considered approaches is that Tracts
does not model population size changes in the populations,
focusing on relative migration rates, whereas DORIS allows re-
covering both population size ﬂuctuations and migration rates,
thus providing insights into the magnitude of migration events.
This increased ﬂexibility, however, may complicate the inference,
also in light of our observation that large sample sizes are
required for the IBD analysis.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we have extended our previous work on the rela-
tionship between long-range haplotypes that are shared IBD
across individuals from a study cohort and the demographic
history of the individuals’ populations of origin. Speciﬁcally,
the described framework removes the limiting requirement that

all sampled individuals belong to a single population and allows
for explicitly modeling and inferring demographic interactions
across multiple demes. The evaluation we performed on ~ 700
synthetic populations conﬁrms the accuracy of the derived IBD
model and suggests that haplotype sharing can be used to gain
insight into ﬁne-scale demographic dynamics for the past tens to
few hundreds of generations, provided enough samples are col-
lected. Our analysis of the HapMap 3 Masai samples, as well as
our previously reported analysis of an Askenazi cohort, suggests
that this method can be applied to currently available datasets,
provided that the quality of haplotype phasing and IBD detec-
tion is carefully considered.

Among available methods for demographic inference, another
approach that explicitly models the effects of recombination (the
Pairwise Sequentially Markovian Coalescent model, PSMC) was
recently proposed in Li and Durbin (2011). This model relies on
a Markovian approximation of the coalescent with recombin-
ation (McVean and Cardin, 2005) and is able to simultaneously
consider the effects of mutation and recombination. The PSMC,
however, differs from the proposed IBD-based model for its
applicability, as it requires full sequence information and is cur-
rently focused on the analysis of remote demographic events
using single individuals, or pairs of phased chromosomes.
Because of the scarcity of coalescent events in the recent history,
the simultaneous analysis of multiple samples is needed to infer
recent demographics. An extension of the PSMC to handle the
analysis of multiple samples, however, is computationally chal-
lenging, and efﬁcient approximations are being developed
(Sheehan et al., 2013).

In addition to these whole-sequence—based methods, inde-
pendent current work (Ralph and Coop, 2013) infers historical
demographic changes from length distributions of IBD segments,
taking a complementary, less parametric approach, thereby
allowing increased ﬂexibility during inference of plausible coales-
cent time distributions, but without providing explicit modeling
of migration and population size changes.

Among other methods aimed at inferring migration, our ap-
proach is conceptually related to those that rely on the frequency
and length of migrant tracts. These methods, however, do not
model population size ﬂuctuations and are dependent on the
possibility of reliably performing ancestry deconvolution to
assign chromosomal tracts to a set of reference populations.
These populations may not be available and, more importantly,
need to be substantially divergent to attain high-quality decon-
volution, as shown in our analysis. Although whole-sequence
datasets and methodological developments may improve the per-
formance of deconvolution methods, this limitation may prevent
methods based on migrant tracts from being effectively used in
the reconstruction of ﬁne-scale migration patterns of the recent
millennia.

Methods based on ancestry deconvolution, however, may in
some scenarios be used in concert with methods based on IBD
sharing. Knowing whether an IBD tract was co-inherited from a
speciﬁc population, in fact, may provide information on the dir-
ectionality of migration, and also offer further insight into deeper
time scales, as shown in Campbell et al. (2012) and Velez et al.
(2012). This direction may be further explored in light of the
recently developed analytical model for migrant tracts and the
presented model for IBD.

The proposed IBD framework will further be enhanced by
accurate whole-genome sequence information, as the presence
of mutations on IBD segments will improve the timing of
common ancestors and IBD detection of shorter segments.
Finally, our model still relies on the assumption of selective neu-
trality. Natural selection has been shown to have an impact on
long-range haplotype sharing (Albrechtsen et al., 2010; Gusev
et al., 2012). Although selective forces are mostly visible at
local scales, demography affects the entire genome. This frame-
work could, therefore, be used to test local deviations from neu-
trality, and the presented extension, which handles the case of
multiple population models, may further assist the analysis of
cross-population IBD sharing in this context.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Sequence-specific transcription factors (T Fs) regulate the
expression of their target genes through interactions with specific
DNA-binding sites in the genome. Data on TF-DNA binding specifici-
ties are essential for understanding how regulatory specificity is
achieved.

Results: Numerous studies have used universal protein-binding
microarray (PBM) technology to determine the in vitro binding specifi-
cities of hundreds of TFs for all possible 8bp sequences (8mers).
We have developed a Bayesian analysis of variance (ANOVA) model
that decomposes these 8mer data into background noise, TF family-
wise effects and effects due to the particular TF. Adjusting for back-
ground noise improves PBM data quality and concordance with in vivo
TF binding data. Moreover, our model provides simultaneous identifi-
cation of TF subclasses and their shared sequence preferences, and
also of 8mers bound preferentially by individual members of TF sub-
classes. Such results may aid in deciphering cis-regulatory codes and
determinants of protein—DNA binding specificity.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcription factors (TFs) play a key role in the regulation of
gene expression by activating or repressing transcription of their
target genes. Regulatory speciﬁcity is achieved primarily by the
recognition of speciﬁc DNA binding sites in the genome by
sequence-speciﬁc TFs. Data on TF-DNA binding speciﬁcity
are important for understanding how transcriptional regulation
is encoded in cis—regulatory sequences in the genome.

TFs can be classiﬁed according to the structural class of their
DNA-binding domains (Luscombe et al., 2000). TFs of the same
structural class adopt the same fold in their DNA-binding
domain and dock with their DNA binding sites in a similar

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

manner. Because of these structural similarities, combined with
sequence similarities because of the origin of TF families from
ancient gene duplications and subsequent mutations, members
of the same DBD class often, but not always, have similar DNA-
binding sequence preferences (Badis et al., 2009). A DBD class
can be further divided into subclasses, with more closely related
proteins exhibiting more similar DNA-binding preferences.
Understanding how highly similar members of a TF family
attain both redundant and divergent regulatory functions
remains a signiﬁcant challenge (Grove et al., 2009).

Accurate and comprehensive data on DNA-binding sequence
speciﬁcities are essential for investigations of regulatory targeting
by TFs, including the identiﬁcation of the molecular determinants
of TF-DNA binding speciﬁcity. A variety of high-throughput
technologies have been developed for determining TF—DNA bind-
ing speciﬁcity (reviewed in Bulyk and Walhout, 2012). Methods
that provide data on in vivo TF occupancies in the genome, such
as chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with either DNA
microarrays (ChIP-chip) or high-throughput sequencing (ChIP-
Seq), provide data on both direct and indirect DNA binding by
TFs (Gordan et al., 2009), which can vary across cellular or en-
vironmental conditions (Harbison et al., 2004). In contrast,
approaches that determine DNA-binding speciﬁcities in vitro pro-
vide data on direct TF—DNA interactions, without the confound-
ing effects of in vivo protein cofactors (Gordan et al., 2009).

Protein-binding microarray (PBM) technology is an in vitro
approach for characterizing the DNA-binding speciﬁcities of
proteins, by assaying the binding of a protein to a library of
double-stranded DNA sequences immobilized on a DNA micro-
array (Bulyk et al., 2001). Universal PBMs contain synthetic
DNA sequences designed to represent all possible k-mers, with
commonly used array designs encompassing all possible 10bp
DNA sequences (k: 10) (Berger et al., 2006). Universal PBMs
have been used in numerous recent studies to determine the
DNA-binding speciﬁcities of hundreds of TFs from a wide
range of organisms (Busser et al., 2012; Campbell et al., 2010;
Grove et al., 2009), with major efforts on TFs encoded in the
genomes of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Badis et al., 2008;
Gordan et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2009) and mouse (Badis et al.,
2009; Berger et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2010).

Universal PBMs contain 60 bp DNA probes, each of which
contains multiple 10mers embedded within variable ﬂanking
sequence. For statistical robustness, binding preference scores

are calculated for all 8mers, each of which is represented on at
least 16 or 32 spots, for palindromic and non-palindromic 8mers,
respectively, on the array. Analysis of universal PBM data using
the Universal PBM Analysis Suite, including the Seed-and-
Wobble algorithm (Berger and Bulyk, 2009; Berger et al.,
2006), which was developed together with the universal PBM
technology, involves background subtraction, various normaliza-
tions of the data and calculation of various binding scores for
each 8mer, including the median ﬂuorescence signal intensity
over all probes that contain a particular 8mer and a rank-
based PBM enrichment (E) score, ranging from —0.5 (worst)
to +0.5 (best). The 8mer data can be used to derive a DNA-
binding speciﬁcity motif, or position weight matrix (PWM)
(Berger and Bulyk, 2009; Berger et al., 2006).

Analyses of large collections of universal PBM data have iden-
tiﬁed previously unknown diversity in the DNA-binding
sequences recognized by TFs (Badis et al., 2009; Berger et al.,
2008; Gordan et al., 2011). Hierarchical clustering of TFs accord-
ing to their similarity in 8mer E-scores has permitted more precise
identiﬁcation of TF subclasses according to their DNA-binding
speciﬁcities (Berger et al., 2008; Gordan et al., 2011; Wei et al.,
2010). In addition, examination of k-mer-binding preferences
within a TF family (here, deﬁned as a group of closely related
TFs belong to the same DBD structural class or the same subclass
within a DBD class) has revealed sets of k—mers bound in common
across the family (‘TF—common’ k—mers) and also sets of k-mers
preferred by an individual member(s) of a TF family. To date,
identiﬁcation of such ‘TF-preferred’ k—mers has been performed
in an ad hoc fashion, in manual investigations of individual sets of
TFs that used various semi-arbitrary thresholds (Busser et al.,
2012) combined with visual inspection (Berger et al., 2008;
Gordan et al., 2011). Such TF—preferred k—mers may contribute
to the distinct regulatory functions that distinguish members of a
TF family.

Although hierarchical clustering has been used successfully for
functional classiﬁcation of gene expression proﬁling microarray
experiments (Eisen et al., 1998) and for identiﬁcation of TF
subclasses based on PBM experiments (Berger et al., 2008;
Gordan et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2010), the inclusion of unneces-
sary features that are irrelevant to cluster determination may
degrade the results. This is especially the case for PBM experi-
ments, where only a small fraction of k—mers measured by
experiments are bound speciﬁcally by the proﬁled TF.
Biclustering is a simultaneous similarity-based clustering
approach that is able to detect subsets of features that exhibit
consistent patterns over subsets of experiments (Cheng and
Church, 2000; Gusenleitner et al., 2012); however, it does not
directly provide a systematic classiﬁcation of TF subclasses.
Model-based methods for identifying and removing batch effects
and other sources of variation have been developed for meta-
analysis of high-throughput data, including microarray-based
gene expression proﬁling experiments (Johnson et al., 2007;
Leek and Storey, 2007, 2008; Leek et al., 2010, 2012). Direct
application of such methods potentially could separate system-
atic background noise from identiﬁcation of k-mers preferred by
different TFs from PBM data.

Here, we present a Bayesian hierarchical analysis of variance
(ANOVA) approach for modeling PBM k-mer data (here,
8mers). Our method identiﬁes 8mers that score artifactually

highly (‘sticky’ 8mers) for unknown reasons. Our approach for
subsequently adjusting for these systematic biases improves over-
all PBM data quality and improves concordance with ChIP-chip
data. Our modeling results in systematic identiﬁcation of TF
subclasses, simultaneously with their shared DNA-binding pref-
erences, as well as the sequence preferences that distinguish them.
Our TF subclassiﬁcation results are consistent with classiﬁca-
tions based on TF DBD sequence similarity. Our method also
permits automated identiﬁcation of TF—preferred k—mers within
TF subclasses. Improved identiﬁcation of TF—preferred k—mers
will aid in studies of potential differences in the targeting of dif-
ferent genomic sites by paralogous TFs, and thus potentially how
they may exert different regulatory functions. We anticipate that
such modeling will aid in identiﬁcation of genomic cis—regulatory
codes (i.e. cis—regulatory sequence features that confer particular
gene expression patterns) and will improve the quality of datasets
for identiﬁcation of the molecular determinants of TF—DNA
sequence speciﬁcity.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

2.1.1 PBM datasets We downloaded universal PBM k—mer
data and DBD structural class data from the UniPROBE data-
base (Robasky and Bulyk, 2011), which hosts data generated by
universal PBM technology on the in vitro DNA-binding speciﬁ-
cities of proteins. The relative binding preference of a TF for
each k—mer (here, k: 8) in universal PBMs is quantiﬁed by the
PBM enrichment score (E—score), which is a modiﬁed form of the
Wilcoxon—Mann—Whitney statistic (Berger et al., 2006). We refer
to this as the observed E—score. We consider observed E-scores
>0.35 as corresponding, in general, to sequence-speciﬁc DNA
binding of the TF. In this study, we included 349 TFs from 19
DBD structural classes (e.g. homeodomain), with the criterion
that there are at least three TFs per DBD class. Two of the
downloaded PBM datasets are of particular interest in this
study. One is a mouse TF dataset with 87 TFs from 12 DBD
classes (ﬁltered according to the above criterion from 104 TFs
from 22 structural classes) previously described by Badis et al.
(2009), in which PBM experiments were performed for each TF
on two different versions of ‘all 10mer’ universal arrays, referred
to as ‘version 1’ and ‘version 2’ [Agilent Technologies, Inc.;
AMADID #015681 (Berger et al., 2008) and #016060 (Zhu
et al., 2009), respectively], which were based on two different
‘all 10mer’ de Bruijn sequences. The other is a yeast TF dataset
with 79 TFs from 10 DBD classes (ﬁltered according to the
aforementioned criterion from 89 TFs from 18 structural classes)
in Zhu et a]. (2009) for which ChIP-chip data (Section 2.1.2) are
publicly available in Harbison et al. (2004) for 57 of these 79
TFs. We also included eight negative control experiments, cor-
responding to duplicate PBM experiments on each of array
design versions 1 and 2, for glutathione S—transferase in binding
buffer and, separately, for a mock in vitro transcription and
translation reaction (Badis et al., 2009).

2.1.2 ChIP-chip datasets We downloaded yeast ChIP-chip data
from Harbison et a]. (2004) for 352 ChIP-chip experiments for
207 TFs under various culture conditions (Harbison et al., 2004).

We use the notation T F_cond to refer to the ChIP-chip experi-
ment for transcription factor T F under environmental condition
cond. For each ChIP-chip dataset, we deﬁned the ‘bound’ inter-
genic regions to be those with ChIP-chip P< 0.001 and the ‘un-
bound ’ intergenic regions to be those with ChIP-chip P>0.5, as
reported by Harbison et al. For 57 of these 207 TFs, PBM data
are available in UniPROBE. We further restricted our analysis to
ChIP experiments for which the ChIP ‘bound’ regions have been
explained as being due to direct DNA binding by the proﬁled TF
(Gordan et al., 2009); this requirement resulted in a ﬁnal collec-
tion of 75 ChIP-chip datasets for 46 TFs.

2.2 Bayesian ANOVA decomposition of PBM k-mer data

2.2.1 Bayesian ANOVA model for identifying ‘TF—common’ and
‘T F—preferred’ k-mers Given family membership (e.g. DBD
structural class) of TFs, the DNA-binding speciﬁcity scores
from PBM experiments can be decomposed into components
attributable to at least three sources of variation: systematic
biases across all PBM experiments, family-wise-binding prefer-
ences shared by members of the same TF family (i.e.
‘TF-common’ k-mers) (Berger et al., 2008; Busser et al., 2012)
and k-mer-binding preferences speciﬁc to individual member(s)
of a given TF family (i.e. ‘TF-preferred’ k-mers) (Berger et al.,
2008; Busser et al., 2012). For PBM datasets from several diverse
DBD classes, we used a Bayesian ANOVA model with hidden
indicators to decompose PBM E-scores into different compo-
nents and to infer the corresponding TF-common and
TF—preferred k-mers systematically.

Speciﬁcally, for a TF family f and a k-mer j, we use PfJ = l
(Pfd- = — l) to indicate that the k-mer is preferred (disfavored) by
members of that TF family, and PM = 0 if members of the
family show no consistent preferred or disfavored binding for
the k-mer. For a TF i and a k-mer j, we use Qi’j = 1
(Qt, j = —l) to indicate that the k-mer is preferred (disfavored)
by the TF, and Qi’j = 0 otherwise. Given family membership
F, = f and the standardized E—score (standardized to have
sample mean 0 and sample variance 1) Yi’j of TF i and k-mer
j, we assume the ANOVA decomposition:

Yi,j=Tj-l-a)f,j-l-5i,j+8i,j (1)

where idiosyncratic noise 8,31- ~ N (0, 02), systematic background
noise I]- ~ N(0,02/y1),

N(wf,oz/y2>, if Pfd- =1,

family-wise effect wﬂj ~ N(wf—, 020,2), if Pf]. = _1,

N(0, 02/19), if PM = 0,
6?, if QM = 1,

and TF-speciﬁc effect 6,31- = 6,.— , if Qijj = —1,
0, if Qijj = 0.

We assign inverse X2 priors on 02, yl and y2, truncated normal
priors on a); and 6;: and independent multinomial priors on
indicators Ps and Qs (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for sensitivity
analysis on the choices of priors). We used a Markov Chain

Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm (Geman and Geman, 1984;

Metropolis et al., 1953) to obtain posterior distribution of par-
ameters and hidden indicators according to our ANOVA model
[Equation (1)] (see Supplementary Methods for the MCMC algo-
rithm and Supplementary Fig. S1 for diagnostics of its conver-
gence). In the following study, we are especially interested in the
posterior distribution of background noise I], and indicators of
family-wise and TF—speciﬁc effects.

2.2.2 Correcting k-mer data for systematic biases Let E(rj|Y) be
the posterior mean of I]- calculated from Equation (1), and let y]-
be the standardized E-score of k-mer j from a PBM experiment.
To remove systematic biases, we subtract the posterior mean of
the background noise from the corresponding standardized E-
score, i.e. yj’. = yj — E(tj|Y). Then, an E-score corrected for sys-
tematic biases can be obtained by transforming yj’. back to the
original scale. We refer to this as the corrected E—score.

2.2.3 Evaluating the statistical significance of TF—preferred
k-mers For a pair of TFs and a given k-mer, we evaluate the
statistical signiﬁcance of its being TF-preferred by the intersec-
tion-union test (Berger and Hsu, 1996) with the null hypothesis
that either none of the TFs exhibits preferred binding to the
k-mer, or the pair have no difference in their binding preferences
for the k-mer (see Supplementary Methods for details). We
report all TF—preferred k-mers at an adjusted P< 0.05 by
Benjamini—Hochberg correction (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995) in an output text ﬁle and automatically create scatterplots
showing the top n (user-speciﬁed setting) TF-preferred k-mers.

2.3 Bayesian partition model for identifying TF subclasses

2.3.1 Bayesian hierarchical partition model The Bayesian
ANOVA model introduced in the previous section assumes
that TFs have been classiﬁed into families. In practice, DBD
structural class can be used to deﬁne TF family memberships.
However, members of the same DBD class do not always exhibit
similar DNA-binding preferences. A collection of PBM datasets
for TFs from the same DBD class provides a unique perspective
to reﬁne the classiﬁcation of TFs into subclasses according
to their DNA-binding sequence preferences. Here, we present
a Bayesian model that simultaneously partitions TFs into
subclasses that have similar DNA-binding proﬁles, and clusters
k-mer DNA sequences into groups that are preferred by one
or more TF subclasses.

Speciﬁcally, let Yi’j be the standardized E-score of TF
ie {1,2, ...,NT} and k-merj 6 {1,2, ...,NK}, where NT is the
number of PBM datasets for TFs from the same DBD class and
N K is the total number of k-mers after collapsing forward and
reverse complements (N K = 32, 896 for k: 8). Suppose C, is the
unknown subclass of TF i and Gj is the unknown group mem-
bership of k-mer j. For each group g of the k-mers
(g = 1,2, ...,NG), Ig = 1 if the group is preferred by one or
more TF subclasses and Ig = 0 otherwise. Then, given C, = c
and Gj = g, we assume:

Yi,j|Gj = g "V N(Mi,g,02) and MLgICi = C "V N(6c,g902/K1) (2)

where 605g follows N(0, 02/19) if Ig = l and 605g 2 0 if Ig = 0.
We further assume that 02 follows an inverse X2 prior
Inv— X2(v0,o(2)) with v0 :03 = 1. As the total number of

subclasses in a DBD class is unknown, we use a Dirichlet process
prior on the subclass assignments C = {C,li = l, 2, . . . ,NT}. The
prior probability of group assignment G = {Gjlj = l, 2, . . . ,NK}
is given by 7T(Gj =g) = l/Ng, where g = 1,2, ...,Ng. In this
article, we show the results using K1 2 K2 2 l and NG= 100 (see
Supplementary Fig. S3c for the sensitivity analysis on the choice
of NG and hyper-parameters K1, K2, v0 and 03).

For each group g of the k-mers, given I = {Ig| g =
l, 2, ...,Ng.}, C and hyper-parameters, we can integrate
out (i.e. marginalize over) intermediate parameters in our hier-
archical model [Equation (2)] to get an explicit expression of
the probability P(Yg|1g, C), where Yg = {yi’lej = g, i =
1,2, ...,NT} is the collection of observed E-scores for k-mers
in the group (Supplementary Methods). Combining with prior
distributions of 71(C), 71(G) and 71(1), we obtain the posterior
distribution of C, G and I given observed E-scores Y,

We can draw from the posterior distribution [Equation (3)] itera-
tively using a collapsed Gibbs sampler (Liu, 1994) (see
Supplementary Methods and Supplementary Fig. S3a and
b for convergence diagnostics).

2.3.2 Motif model for aligning k-mer DNA sequences We build
a PWM to characterize the DNA-binding speciﬁcity of a group
of k-mers (e. g. TF-common k-mers for a TF family). An element
of PWM Q = {qman} is deﬁned as the probability of observing a
nucleotide n e {A, C, G, 7] at position m e {1, 2, ..., W}, where
W is the pre—determined length of the PWM (here, W: 10 for
8mer PBM data). Let S,- = {sjjlll = l, 2,  be the DNA se-
quence of k-mer j 6 {1,2, ...,Ng} in group g, where Ng is the
number of k-mers in group g, and aj is the alignment position of
k-merj within the PWM, where aj e {—4, — 3, ..., W— k —l— 4}.
Here, we allow the k-mer sequence not to be fully ‘contained’
within a PWM but instead require that the alignments have an
overlap of at least 4nt. For example, aj = —2 means that the
third position of k-mer j is aligned with the start (i.e. 5’-end)
of the PWM. The background probability of nucleotide
n e {A, C, G, 7], r", is assumed to be 0.25. The probability of
sequence being generated by the motif model is then given by:

k
P(Sj|aj’  = n (rsj,11{aj+l50} + qaj+lasj,lI{ISaj‘]—ISW} + rSj,11{aj+l> W})’

(4)
where I A is an indicator function of event A. By assigning
appropriate priors (Supplementary Methods), we can use a
Gibbs sampling strategy (Geman and Geman, 1984; Lawrence
et al., 1993; Liu, 2008; McCue et al., 2001) to iteratively update
{aj} and Q based on the model shown in Equation (4). Finally,
we construct a PWM based on the posterior modes of {aj} and
generate a corresponding motif sequence logo (Schneider and
Stephens, 1990).

3 RESULTS

We have developed a Bayesian ANOVA model to decompose
8mer PBM E-scores into background noise (i.e. artifactually
high-scoring background k-mers), family-wise effects and

experiment-speciﬁc effects, given a collection of PBM experiments
and TF family classiﬁcation based on DBD structural class.
Below we start with the identiﬁcation of artifactually high-scoring
background k-mers, then describe the identiﬁcation of TF sub-
classes based on the k-mer data and conclude with identiﬁcation
of experiment-speciﬁc effects in analyses aimed at improved iden-
tiﬁcation of sets of k-mers bound preferentially by one TF as
compared with a closely related TF (i.e. ‘TF—preferred’ k-mers).

3.1 Identiﬁcation of artifactually high-scoring (‘sticky’)
k-mers

From the ANOVA model [Equation (1)] described in Section
2.2.1, we can infer k-mer background noise based on their pos-
terior means. Background noise constitutes a non-negligible
component of E-scores with a standard deviation of 0.063,
as compared with a standard deviation of 0.148 for E-scores
(Fig. la). The posterior means of the variance and scale param-
eters 02, yl and W are 0.647, 1.985 and 1.505, respectively.
Examination of the sequences of the top 50 artifactually high-
scoring k-mers, ranked according to their background noise
and their E-scores across 357 experiments in our PBM datasets,
indicates that AT-rich k-mers have artifactually high E-scores in
nearly all PBM datasets for a diverse range of TF DBD classes
(Fig. lo); the most ‘sticky’ k-mer across a wide range of TF DBD
classes is AAAAAAAA (Fig. 1b).

To compare the background noise of k-mers on different array
designs, we calculated the k-mer background noise from the
mouse TF PBM data from Badis et al. (2009), in which two dif-
ferent de Bruijn sequence array designs were used in PBM experi-
ments for each TF; these are designated as array design versions 1
and 2 [AMADID #015681 (Berger et al., 2008) and #016060 (Zhu
et al., 2009), respectively]. Comparison of the ‘sticky’ k-mers (i.e.
those with background noise larger than one standard deviation
of the original E-scores, which is 0.148 for version 1 and 0.153 for
version 2) from this dataset indicates that (Fig. 1d) the two dif-
ferent array versions exhibit different numbers of ‘sticky’ k-mers,
and that array design version 2 is noisier (i.e. has a larger number
of ‘sticky’ k-mers) than version 1 (see Supplementary Figs S4 and
S5 for additional comparisons of these two array versions). The
two different array designs exhibited some differences in k-mer
background noise (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r: 0.65;
Supplementary Fig. S5a) as compared with independent experi-
ments using the same array design (Pearson correlation coefﬁcient
r: 0.88; Supplementary Fig. S5b), for example, although
AAAAAAAA is artifactually high scoring in both version 1
and version 2 datasets, CCCCGCCC is found to be ‘sticky’
only in version 1 datasets (Supplementary Fig. S4a). The top 20
artifactually highest scoring k-mers, together with their noise
levels, from each of these two array versions are listed in
Supplementary Figure S4c. To further investigate this effect, we
compared the results from the Badis et al. mouse TF PBM data
with the set of ‘sticky’ k-mers that we identiﬁed in analysis of a
separate, yeast TF PBM dataset (Zhu et al., 2009), both of which
used version 1 arrays. We observed signiﬁcant overlap in the
‘sticky’ k-mers identiﬁed in these different datasets (Fig. 1d);
differences in these sets of ‘sticky’ k-mers could be due to differ-
ences in protein sample preparation, experimental variation and
differences in the representation of different DBD classes among

Zhu et al. (2009) studies.

3.2 Correction for artifactually high-scoring background
for ‘sticky’ k-mers

As described in Section 2.2.2, we correct the E-score of each
k-mer by subtracting its background noise from the original
(observed) E-score. For example, for PBM data for the yeast
TF an4 published in Zhu et al. (2009), the observed E-scores
and their corresponding background noise are highly correlated
(Pearson correlation coefﬁcient r = 0.71; Fig. 2a); subtracting the
background noise from the E-scores reduced this correlation to
0.26. Comparison of the motif logo generated from the 68 k-mers
with observed E-scores >0.35 with the logo generated from the
same number of top scoring k-mers after correction for back-
ground noise shows that the quality of the motif greatly improves
by correcting the E-scores for systematic biases (Fig. 2b).

3.3 Evaluation of corrected k-mer E-scores as compared
with ChIP-chip data

We used in vivo ChIP-chip—binding data to further evaluate the
effect of background noise correction of PBM E-scores.

Speciﬁcally, we ﬁrst applied background noise correction to
the yeast PBM data from Zhu et al. (2009), and then assessed
whether this resulted in an improvement in scoring of regions
called as ‘bound’ in the Harbison et al. (2004) ChIP-chip data for
the same TF. Brieﬁy, for a given TF and a given intergenic se-
quence, we ﬁrst calculated an occupancy score by summing PBM
median signal intensities for each k-mer with an observed E-score
>0.35 (Zhu et al., 2009). We used these PBM-based occupancy
scores to rank the intergenic sequences within the ChIP-chip
‘bound’ and ‘unbound’ regions for each ChIP-chip dataset,
and then calculated the corresponding area under the receiver
operating characteristic curve (AUC statistic). We repeated this
same AUC calculation using the corrected E-scores. For com-
parison, we rank k-mers by their corrected E-scores and score the
intergenic sequences using the same number of top-ranked k-
mers as in the calculation with the original (observed) E-scores.
In practice, the background correction of a new PBM experiment
is based on the estimation from previous experiments; to accur-
ately evaluate this process, we used an independent mouse
TF PBM dataset (with the same array design) from Badis
et al. (2009) to calculate k-mer background noise.

Overall, use of the corrected E-scores resulted in a statistically
signiﬁcant increase (P=2.8 X 10‘4 by Student’s t-test) in AUC

E Z 0.35. Red points indicate speciﬁcally bound 8mers after background
correction. The correlation between E—scores and background noise
diminishes from 0.71 to 0.26 after correction. (b) Improvement in motif
quality for an4 after correction for k-mer background noise

statistics (Fig. 3). Some ChIP-chip datasets exhibited a sharp
increase in AUC by using the corrected E-scores, for example,
the AUC for an4 increased from 0.573 to 0.749 for ChIP-chip
data for a highly hyperoxic condition (RPN4_H202Hi) and
from 0.680 to 0.910 for ChIP-chip data for a mildly hyperoxic
condition (RPN4_H202Lo). Moreover, PBM datasets with rela-
tively few high-scoring k-mers and low AUC values in such
ChIP-chip analysis showed a uniform increase in AUC with
the use of corrected E-scores; this observation is consistent
with the hypothesis that the effect of k-mer background noise
is more prominent in PBM datasets for TFs with relatively
weaker binding signal. Any decreases in AUC value from
using corrected E-scores were minor (<6%), and in one extreme
case—Yap6, for which use of corrected E-scores resulted in a
decrease of 6.0% from the original AUC value—the difference
seems to be because of AT-rich ‘sticky’ k-mers that are bound
sequence speciﬁcally by certain TFs, such as Suml, which seems
to provide for indirect binding of the ChIP-proﬁled TF (i.e.
Yap6) to DNA (Gordan et al., 2009).

3.4 Identiﬁcation of ‘TF-common’ k-mers

By using the ANOVA decomposition model, we are able to iden-
tify groups of k-mers bound in common across the family
(‘TF-common’ k-mers). For example, k-mers with high posterior
probabilities for being TF-common have uniformly high E-scores
for TFs in the ETS DBD class and relatively low E-scores for
TFs in all the other DBD classes (Fig. 4a). The PWM constructed
from these k-mers indicates a shared binding speciﬁcity for the
ETS DBD class (Fig. 4a, top). Characterization of TF-common
k-mers for other DBD classes (GATA, HLH, HMG—box
and homeodomains) are given in Supplementary Figures
S7—S10. Posterior distribution of family-wise effects and numbers
of TF-common k-mers for all the DBD classes are given in
Supplementary Figure S6.

3.5 Identiﬁcation of TF subclasses based on similarity of
PBM k-mer data

Our Bayesian hierarchical partition model allows for categoriza-
tion of TF subclasses based on DNA-binding preferences, which
can simultaneously determine common binding sequences for
each subclass. Previously, Berger et al. discovered separate
DNA-binding speciﬁcity subgroups by considering the overlap
among top 100 highest-afﬁnity 8mers for homeodomains (Berger
et al., 2008). Distinct binding patterns were also identiﬁed by
manually examining 8mers with E-scores greater than a thresh-
old score of 0.45. Our model-based analysis of homeodomains
not only shows subclassiﬁcation that is consistent with the results
of Berger et al. (2008) but also systematically characterizes the
common binding sequences for different subclasses of homeodo-
mains (Supplementary Fig. S11).

We further applied our model to determine subclasses and
their DNA-binding speciﬁcities in the ETS DBD class.
Classiﬁcation of 22 mouse ETS factors by hierarchical clustering
(Fig. 4c) over two groups of 8mers identiﬁed in our analysis as
being preferred by ETS subclasses is in general consistent
with the classiﬁcation obtained by aligning ETS-domain peptide
sequences using the ClustalW algorithm (Fig. 4d), and it is
broadly similar to the results obtained in Wei et al. (2010), in
which the similarity between DNA-binding speciﬁcity motifs
was obtained using the minimum Kullback-Leibler divergence
between the multinomial distributions deﬁned by the motifs.
Notably, motifs generated according to subclass-preferred
8mers (Fig. 4c) are different from the motif generated from the
TF—common k-mers (Fig. 4a). A subclass of the ETS factors with
similar ETS-domain peptide sequences according to ClustalW
shows a speciﬁc binding preference to a consensus sequence
ACCGGAT (marked by a red box in Fig. 4c). Interestingly,
members of this subclass can be distinguished further according
to their binding preferences for the consensus sequence CCGGT.
Differential binding preference by ETS factors for the core
sequence GGAT has been observed previously (Wei et al.,
2010), where its molecular basis was explored. By automatically
identifying 8mers that have the most distinct binding patterns,

our model is able to characterize the binding speciﬁcities among
members of the ETS DBD class in more detail.

3.6 Identiﬁcation of ‘TF-preferred’ k-mers

Highly similar members of a TF family can show different DNA
binding sequence preferences. For example, the homeodomains
th4 and th2 both bind most preferentially to the canonical
sequence TAATTA, but they differ in their preferences for other
k-mers (Berger et al., 2008). In Figure 5a, we show the DNA-
binding speciﬁcity motifs for 8mers that are identiﬁed as TF-
preferred by th2 but not th4, and for those identiﬁed
as TF—preferred by th4 but not th2, according to our
ANOVA model described in Section 2.2.1. At the same time,
we also applied the procedure described in Section 2.2.3 to
search for TF-preferred k-mers based on their statistical signiﬁ-
cance calculated by an intersection-union test. To have a sufﬁ-
ciently large sample size, we focused on TF—preferred 6mers in
this study, and our tests are based on observed E-scores of 8mers
containing a given 6mer. Analyses based on observed E-scores
yielded nearly identical results as those based on corrected E-
scores, as the differences between E-scores for a pair of TFs
for the same k-mer are invariant to correction. The top three
TF—preferred 6mers (each at P< 1.0 x 10‘7) found by this ana-
lysis in a pairwise comparison of th2 and th4 are apparent as
off-diagonal points in a scatterplot of 8mer E-scores (Fig. 5b).

Bayesian hierarchical model of PBM k-mer data

 

Of note, the TF—preferred 6mers identiﬁed by our model-based
approach are consistent with TF-preferred 6mers identiﬁed by
the intersection-union test. All four 6mers (TAATGA and
TAACGA for th2 and TAATCA and TAATCT for th4)
identiﬁed in (Berger et al., 2008) by a primarily manual approach
are also signiﬁcant in our new, automated analysis
(Supplementary Fig. S12). In addition, our automated analysis
ﬁnds additional TF-preferred k-mers, for example, it ﬁnds
TAATGG as a statistically signiﬁcant TF—preferred 6mer
(P: 6.9 x 10‘”) for th2 and CAATCA as a statistically sig-
niﬁcant 6mer (P: 1.2 x 10‘”) for th4, in a pairwise compari-
son of those two TFs. Note that our analysis identiﬁes CAATCA
as preferred by th4 in comparison with both th2 and also
with th3 (Supplementary Fig. S13).

4 DISCUSSION

Accurate high-resolution datasets on the binding preferences of
TFs for comprehensive collections of DNA sequences are essen-
tial for understanding the nature of protein—DNA binding
speciﬁcity and how those speciﬁcities are used in transcriptional
regulatory codes encoded in genomes. In this study, we devel-
oped a Bayesian model-based approach for analyzing k-mer TF-
DNA binding speciﬁcity data obtained from universal PBM
experiments (Berger et al., 2006). Our model decomposes
k-mer data (here, 8mers) into artifactually high-scoring 8mers,
8mers bound in common by a TF family and those bound pref-
erentially by a particular member(s) of a TF family (TF-pre—
ferred k-mers). Adjusting PBM 8mer E-scores for the identiﬁed
systematic biases improved overall PBM data quality and cor-
relations with in vivo TF binding data obtained by ChIP-chip
(Harbison et al., 2004). The TF subclasses identiﬁed by our
modeling approach are consistent with TF subclasses based on
TF DBD protein sequence similarity. TF—preferred k-mers are
identiﬁed in an automated and systematic fashion by our model,
without relying on visual inspection, manual curation or arbi-
trary thresholds; our model captures TF-preferred k-mers previ-
ously identiﬁed through a combination of such other methods
(Berger et al., 2008; Busser et al., 2012), while being more com-
prehensive in identifying statistically signiﬁcantly TF-preferred
k-mers. Systematic identiﬁcation of TF-preferred k-mers should
help to reduce investigator bias in searching for TF—preferred k-
mers and should aid in studies aimed at investigating the poten-
tial regulatory signiﬁcance of TF-preferred versus TF-common
k-mers (Busser et al., 2012; Gordan et al., 2011).

Although our analysis identiﬁed 8mers that tend to score
artifactually highly in the universal PBM datasets that we exam-
ined, on its own, it does not provide an explanation for these
observations. We investigated the various data normalizations
that are performed on the universal PBM data, but we did not
ﬁnd any of them to contribute to artifactually high scores for
these 8mers. We cannot exclude the possibility that these ‘sticky’
8mers constitute a distinct set of non-speciﬁc sequences that are
bound by numerous TFs more preferentially than truly nonspe-
ciﬁc or even disfavored sequences. Determining the underlying
cause of these ‘sticky’ 8mers will require additional experimental
studies in the future.

To distinguish family-wise—binding effects from systematic
biases, our ANOVA model [Equation (1)] requires a collection

of TFs from diverse DBD classes and a sufﬁcient number of TFs
from each DBD class (at least three in this study). Estimation of
k-mer background noise given a limited number of experiments
(e.g. when adopting a new array design or platform) can be
challenging. In this study, we focused our analysis on the
observed E-scores because of the robustness of the E-score to
experimental variation (Berger et al., 2006). Future development
of non—rank-based approaches might allow for improved classi-
ﬁcation of TFs and k-mers.

In this study, we analyzed data from two speciﬁc universal
array designs, synthesized based on two different de Bruijn
sequences, each of which covers all 10mers. Our model could
be applied to k-mer data generated using other universal array
designs, including those based on higher-order de Bruijn se-
quences that comprehensively cover longer k-mers (Philippakis
et al., 2008). Moreover, our approach is not limited to array
designs based on de Bruijn sequences, but rather it can be applied
to any datasets using PBMs or other assays for which binding
scores for k-mers are generated.

Numerous studies have focused on different TF structural
classes, with the goal of identifying recognition rules underlying
protein—DNA binding speciﬁcity (Benos et al., 2002; De Masi
et al., 2011; Noyes et al., 2008; Suzuki and Yagi, 1994). Precise
classiﬁcation of TFs according to their DNA-binding sequence
preferences together with identiﬁcation of those sets of preferred
sequences, as provided by our modeling approach, will permit
more detailed studies of the molecular determinants of TF-DNA
binding speciﬁcity. Improved identiﬁcation of k-mers bound
preferentially by different TF family members will aid in inves-
tigations of what amino acid residues in the proteins correlate
with differences in preferences for binding different k-mers.

Many studies of DNA regulatory elements have searched for
combinations of motifs enriched within known or putative cis-
regulatory elements (\Narner et al., 2008), including investiga-
tions of whether there are preferential spacings or orientations
of how the TF binding sites are arranged within promoters (Beer
and Tavazoie, 2004; Senger et al., 2004) or transcriptional enhan-
cers (Arnosti and Kulkarni, 2005). Moreover, how different TF
family members achieve their distinct regulatory effects is still not
well understood; TF-preferred k-mers constitute one mechanism
by which paralogous TFs can attain distinct regulatory roles
(Busser et al., 2012; Fong et al., 2012; Hollenhorst et al., 2009).
More accurate, precise data on the DNA-binding sequence pref-
erences of different TFs, in particular paralogous TFs, will be
important for more detailed investigations of cis-regulatory
codes.

The Bayesian hierarchical ANOVA modeling approach we
present in this study is general and could be applied to other
data types, beyond DNA-binding speciﬁcity data. Our modeling
approach could be adapted to other sequence or experimental
datasets to identify data features that are common to classes of
proteins, deﬁned according to either DBD structural class as we
did in this study for sequence-speciﬁc TFs or to other annota-
tions which may be more relevant for other types of proteins,
versus features that are speciﬁc to individual proteins or subsets
of proteins. Results from such studies might contribute to
an improved understanding of different families of proteins,
including the redundant versus divergent functions of individual

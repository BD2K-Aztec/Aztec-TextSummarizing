Abstract

Motivation: The identification of microRNA (miRNA) target sites is fundamentally important for
studying gene regulation. There are dozens of computational methods available for miRNA target
site prediction. Despite their existence, we still cannot reliably identify miRNA target sites, partially
due to our limited understanding of the characteristics of miRNA target sites. The recently pub—
lished CLASH (crosslinking ligation and sequencing of hybrids) data provide an unprecedented op—
portunity to study the characteristics of miRNA target sites and improve miRNA target site predic—
tion methods.

Results: Applying four different machine learning approaches to the CLASH data, we identified
seven new features of miRNA target sites. Combining these new features with those commonly
used by existing miRNA target prediction algorithms, we developed an approach called TaeriR
for miRNA target site prediction. Testing on two human and one mouse non—CLASH datasets, we
showed that TaeriR predicted more than 74.2% of true miRNA target sites in each dataset.
Compared with three existing approaches, we demonstrated that TaeriR is superior to these
existing approaches in terms of better recall and better precision.

1 Introduction

 

The prediction of microRNA (miRNA) target sites is critical in
understanding miRNA function and their involvement in various
biological processes (Lewis et 61]., 2003). MiRNAs are short noncod—
ing RNAs that bind and regulate their target mRNAs in a variety of
biological processes, such as cell development, differentiation, pro-
liferation and apoptosis pathways (Sassen et 61]., 2008; Schanen and
Li, 2011). The binding of miRNAs to their target mRNAs degrades
the target mRNAs and/0r prevents the target mRNAs from being
translated into proteins, and thus modulates gene expression at the
post—transcriptional level (Axtell et 61]., 2011; Bartel, 2009; Muljo
et 61]., 2010; Wang et 61]., 2011). By identifying miRNA target sites,

the target mRNAs and the potential functional roles of miRNAs
may thus be discovered.

Several features are commonly believed to be important for pre—
dicting miRNA target sites. Among them, seed match, the exact se—
quence matching between the positions 2—7 of an miRNA and a
segment of 6 nucleotides (nt) long in target mRNAs, has been re—
ported to be essential for miRNA—mRNA binding (Brennecke et al.,
2005). Accessibility, which measures how likely a region in an
mRNA sequence is ‘open’ or accessible for an miRNA to bind, is
well known to be important for functional miRNA—mRNA binding
(Kertesz et 61]., 2007). In addition, other features such as AU content
(Grimson et 61]., 2007), folding energy (Enright et 61]., 2004;

Grimson et al., 2007; Yousef et al., 2007) and conservation
(Helwak et al., 2013) are also regarded as informative indicators of
functional miRNA—mRNA bindings.

Dozens of tools for miRNA target site prediction have been de—
veloped in the past decade, based on different subsets of the afore—
mentioned features (Peterson et al., 2014). For instance, miRanda
(Enright et al., 2004) utilizes the features of seed match, conserva—
tion and free energy for target site prediction. TargetScan (Friedman
et al., 2009; Grimson et al., 2007) uses seed match, pairing of
mRNAs with 3’ of miRNAs, local AU content, etc., for target site
identification. In addition to these traditional miRNA target site pre—
diction tools, recently, several tools based on next—generation
sequencing technologies have been developed (Chou et al., 2013;
Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012; Wang et al., 2014). For instance,
miRTarCLIP (Chou et al., 2013) identifies miRNA target sites from
the data generated by high—throughput sequencing of RNA isolated
by crosslinking immunoprecipitation (HITS-CLIP) experiments (Chi
et al., 2009; Licatalosi et al., 2008) and photoactivatable—
ribonucleoside—enhanced crosslinking and immunoprecipitation
(PAR-CLIP) experiments (Hafner et al., 2010).

Despite the existence of dozens of computational methods, com—
putational identification of miRNA target sites remains a challeng—
ing problem partially due to our limited understanding of the
characteristics of miRNA target sites. For instance, although match—
ing seed is not always sufficient for a functional miRNA—mRNA
interaction (Brennecke et al., 2005; Didiano and Hobert, 2006), it
has been thought to be necessary for most animal miRNA—mRNA
binding. However, studies have shown non—canonical pairings that
allow GzU wobbles and even mismatches can be functional
(Brennecke et al., 2005; Didiano and Hobert, 2006). Recent cross—
linking ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH) experiments
(Helwak et al., 2013) have further shown that seed match, including
canonical and non—canonical seed—matching, is not required for cer—
tain miRNA—mRNA interactions.

The CLASH experiments (Helwak et al., 2013) provide an un—
precedented opportunity to advance our understanding of miRNA
target sites and to develop better computational methods for
miRNA target site prediction. Compared with other high—
throughput experimental approaches such as HITS—CLIP (Chi et al.,
2009; Licatalosi et al., 2008) and PAR—CLIP (Hafner et al., 2010)
that identify miRNA target sequences only, CLASH experiments
provide both miRNAs and their corresponding target sequences.
With thousands of target sequences for dozens of miRNAs in one
CLASH experiment, new features of miRNA target sites may be
inferred and better computational methods for miRNA target site
prediction may be developed.

In this study, we developed a new approach for miRNA target
site prediction called Target Prediction for miRNAs (TaeriR).
TaeriR applies a random—forest—based approach to integrate six
conventional features and seven new features to predict miRNA tar—
get sites. These features were learned from the only CLASH dataset
in mammal that is made publically available by Helwak et al.
(2013). By cross—validation, we showed that TaeriR had an aver—
age recall of 0.543 and an average precision of 0.181. Tested on
three independent datasets, including two human PAR—CLIP data—
sets and one mouse HITS—CLIP dataset, we demonstrated that
TaeriR identified more than 74.2% of known miRNA target sites
in each dataset. Compared with three existing approaches, we found
that TaeriR is superior to existing approaches, in terms of both
higher recall and higher precision. The TaeriR method is imple-
mented in a python package, which is freely available at http://
hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/miRNNTaerin.

2 Materials and Methods

2.1 Training and testing data

We downloaded 18 514 miRNA target sites of 399 miRNAs from
CLASH experiments (Helwak et al., 2013). These target sites were
considered as positive target sites. We also generated 18 514 corres—
ponding negative or ‘false’ target sites in a manner similar to a previ-
ous study (Li et al., 2014), with the following criteria: (i) A positive
site and its corresponding negative site are on the same mRNA; (ii)
The positive and its corresponding negative site has similar CG di—
nucleotide frequency; (iii) The positive and its corresponding nega—
tive site has similar number of the nucleotide G; (iv) A negative site
does not overlap with any positive site; and (v) With multiple candi-
date negative sites in an mRNA, select the one with the lowest fold—
ing energy.

We performed cross—validation to determine which machine
learning method to be used in TaeriR and to assess the accuracy
of TaeriR. To determine which method to be used, we randomly
chose 10 000 positive sites and 10 000 negative sites for training
and the remaining positive and negative sites for testing. We re—
peated this process five times and selected the method with the F2
scores. To test TaeriR, we used the same five training datasets.
For a corresponding testing dataset, we input the mRNA sequences
that contain the corresponding remaining 8514 positive sites and the
remaining 8514 negative sites for testing. The final model used to
predict miRNA target sites by TaeriR in this study was trained
using the first set of randomly chosen 10 000 positive sites and 10
000 negative sites.

We also collected two independent PAR—CLIP datasets from the
human HEK293 cell line for testing. PAR—CLIP datasets were used
because a large number of potential miRNA target regions called
crosslink—centered regions (CCRs) could be obtained from PAR-
CLIP. CCRs were considered as positive target sites. One PAR—CLIP
dataset with 17 310 CCRs was from Hafner et al. (2010). Only 16
041 of these CCRs were able to be mapped to mRNAs and resulted
in 10 023 target mRNAs. In this dataset, 60 miRNAs accounted for
more than 90% of total miRNA reads and 120 miRNAs accounted
for 99% of total miRNA reads. In other words, depending on the
cutoff to define active miRNAs, there were mainly 60 or 120
miRNAs related to these 17 310 CCRs. The other PAR—CLIP dataset
with 44 497 CCRs was obtained from Kishore et al. (2011). Only
43 251 of the 44 497 CCRs were able to be mapped to mRNAs and
resulted in 17 794 target mRNAs. Same as the first PAR—CLIP data—
set, depending on the cutoff to define active miRNAs, there were
mainly 60 or 120 related miRNAs in this dataset.

To test TaeriR on general datasets, we compared the TaeriR
predictions with the experimentally validated miRNA targets by
general methods in TarBase 7.0 (Vlachos et al., 2014). There are
421 086 POSITIVE TarBase 7.0 miRNA—mRNA interactions in
human. We chose the top 100 and 50 miRNAs, which had the larg-
est number of interactions in TabBase 7.0, for further analyses. The
rationale to choose top miRNAs was that we had more experimen—
tally validated target mRNAs of these miRNAs and thus could as—
sess the accuracy of TaeriR and other tools better. The top 100
and 50 miRNAs in TarBase 7.0 accounted for 100 608 (23.9%) and
60 818 (14.4%) of human TarBase 7.0 interactions, respectively.
There were 9869 and 9823 mRNAs associated with these 100 and
50 top miRNAs, respectively. We ran TaeriR and other tools with
the 100 or 50 miRNAs and the corresponding mRNAs they inter-
acted as input to predict miRNA target sites.

In addition to the human datasets, we collected an independent
HITS-CLIP dataset from the mouse cortex cell (Chi et al., 2009).

This dataset provided an Argo—miRNA—mRNA ternary interaction
map related to 20 miRNA families, 2953 mRNAs and 11 080
miRNA—mRNA interactions. We further downloaded the corres—
ponding 119 miRNAs from the 20 miRNA families from miRBase
(Griffiths—Jones et al., 2006).

2.2 Potential features considered

We considered the following 18 features of miRNA target sites in
miRNA—mRNA duplexes: (i) folding energy; (ii) seed match; (iii) ac—
cessibility; (iv) AU content; (v) stem conservation; (vi) ﬂanking con-
servation; (vii) difference between stem and ﬂanking conservation;
(viii) m/e motif; (ix) the total number of paired positions; (x) the
length of the target mRNA region; (xi) the length of the largest con—
secutive pairs; (xii) the position of the largest consecutive pairs rela—
tive to the miRNA 5’; (xiii) the length of the largest consecutive
pairs allowing 2 mismatches; (xiv) the position of the largest con—
secutive pairs allowing 2 mismatches; (xv) the number of paired pos—
itions at the miRNA 3’ end, where 3’ miRNA end was defined as the
last 7 positions of the miRNA; (xvi) the total number of paired pos—
itions in the seed region and the miRNA 3’ end; (xvii) the difference
between the number of paired positions in the seed region and that
in the miRNA 3’ end and (xviii) exon preference (Ding et al., 2015).
The first seven features had been used in existing tools (Peterson
et al., 2014), we thus considered them as conventional features.
Remaining features that had not been commonly used by miRNA—
target prediction tools were defined as ‘new’ features.

The detailed definition of all 18 features and how to calculate
their values are provided in the Supplementary File S1. We brieﬂy
explain the m/e motif feature here, as it is not as self—evident as
others. The m/e motif describes how different positions in miRNAs
match the corresponding positions in target sites. Here two positions
match means that nucleotides at the two positions are complement
to each other. For instance, nucleotides at positions in miRNA seed
regions tend to match the nucleotides at the corresponding positions
in target sites and nucleotides at positions in other miRNA regions
tend to form mismatches or bulges with the corresponding positions
in target sites. We thus have a sequential pattern composed of two
letters ‘m’ and ‘e’ to describe preferred matching and non-matching
positions, respectively. To calculate the m/e scores, for each position
in miRNAs, we calculate a probability [9,- that this position matches
the corresponding position in target sites by using all positive target
sites in the training dataset. The m/e motif score of a potential target
site is calculated as score = 1 logpi, where x is the length of
the miRNA and x is smaller than 24.

2.3 Four computational methods for feature selection

Not all of the aforementioned 18 features are effective for target site
prediction. To select important features, we applied the following
four machine learning methods: step—wise logistic regression
(Ralston and Wilf, 1960), least absolute shrinkage and selection op—
erator (LASSO) (Tibshirani, 1996), randomized logistic regression
(Meinshausen and Buhlmann, 2010) and random forests (Svetnik
et al., 2003). The step—wise logistic regression repeatedly eliminates
the least significant feature until all significant features are found,
which is performed by using the GLM package in R (http://data.
princeton.edu/IUglmshtml). LASSO constructs a linear model and
shrinks the coefficients of non—important features to zero. All fea—
tures with non—zero regression coefficients are ’selected’ as import—
ant features. We used the glmnet package (http://cran.r—pr0ject.org/
web/packages/glmnet/index.html) in R for the LASSO analysis. The
randomized logistic regression randomly chooses a portion of the

training samples and performs the logistic regression to select signifi—
cant features. It repeats this procedure many times and counts the
number of times each feature is selected, which is regarded as the im—
portance of the features. The randomized logistic regression was
performed with the scikit—learn package (http://scikit—learn.org/sta
ble/) in python. The random forests method grows many classifica—
tion trees and assigns a new object to the class most trees vote for
this object. We used the random forest model from sklearn package
(http://scikit—learn.0rg/stable/) in python. Each of the four methods
has been applied to select features in previous studies (Chen and Lin,
2006; Chou et al., 2001; Diaz—Uriarte and De Andres, 2006; Kim
and Kim, 2004; Kokaly and Clark, 1999; Ma and Huang, 2008;
Saeys et al., 2007; Yeo et al., 1995) and demonstrated good per—
formance in feature selection. We claim a feature as an important
feature if at least two of the four methods consider this feature im—
portant. By applying the four methods to the training data, we se—
lected 13 important features (Section 3.1).

2.4 TaeriR, a random—forest—based approach for
miRNA target site prediction
With the 13 selected features, we developed a random—forest—based
approach called TaeriR for miRNA target site prediction. We
chose the random forests method because we applied the above four
approaches to the aforementioned training and testing datasets and
found that random forests gave the best performance (Section 3.2).
TaeriR predicts miRNA target sites in three steps with the in—
put of a set of miRNAs and a set of mRNAs. First, TaeriR gener-
ates candidate target sites based on seed match or minimal folding
energy (Enright et al., 2004; Grimson et al., 2007; Yousef et al.,
2007). For a given miRNA, TaeriR scans an mRNA sequence
with the seed region of the miRNA (positions 2—7) to find perfect
seed—matching sites. These sites are defined as the first set of candi—
date target sites. In addition, TaeriR applies RNA-duplex from
the Vienna RNA package (Hofacker, 2003) to obtain the top target
sites with the lowest folding energy. These energy—based sites are
defined as the second set of candidate target sites. The combination
of seed match and folding energy helps TaeriR to pick up almost
all true target sites from the beginning. Second, for each candidate
target sites, TaeriR calculates the values of the 13 selected features
(Supplementary File S1). Finally, TaeriR applies the trained
random—forest based predictor to predict target sites. The output of
the random—forest model is the predicted probability that a candi—
date target site is a true target site. We have compared nine probabil—
ity cutoffs to define target sites using the F2 score, since we put
more emphasis on the recall than the precision. The cutoffs 0.5 and
0.6 have almost the similar F2 scores, while the cutoff 0.5 has the
largest recall (Supplementary File S2). Therefore, we used 0.5 for the
following analyses. We provide a parameter —p in TaeriR, users
can choose other cutoffs based on their own needs.

2.5 Comparisons with other methods

We compared TaeriR with the following methods: targetScan
V2010 (Friedman et al., 2009; Grimson et al., 2007), targetScan
V2015 (Agarwal et al., 2015), miRanda (Enright et al., 2004) and
miRmap (Vejnar et al., 2013; Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012). The
targetScan and miRanda are two of the most widely used miRNA tar—
get prediction tools. We used the following commands to run them:

parameters as in Vejnar and Zdobnov (2012) when running miRmap.

3 Results

3.1 All but one conventional features and seven new
features were selected by different approaches

We applied four approaches to select important features from the 18
potential features. Each approach selected a similar but slightly dif-
ferent subset of features (Supplementary File S3). By defining fea-
tures selected by at least two approaches as important features, we
discovered 13 important features (Fig. 1) . They are: (i) folding en-
ergy; (ii) seed match; (iii) accessibility; (iv) AU content; (v) stem con—
servation; (vi) ﬂanking conservation; (vii) m/e motif; (viii) the total
number of paired positions; (ix) the length of the target mRNA re—
gion; (x) the length of the largest consecutive pairings; (xi) the pos—
ition of the largest consecutive pairings relative to the 5’ end of
miRNA; (xii) the number of paired positions at the miRNA 3’ end.
Recall miRNA 3’ end meant the last 7 positions of a miRNA and
(xiii) the difference between the number of paired positions in the
seed region and that in the miRNA 3’ end.

An interesting observation from Figure 1 was the removal of one
and only one conventional feature, the difference between stem and
ﬂanking conservation. This feature was used in previous studies
(Helwak et al., 2013; Pollard et al., 2010). The removal of this fea—
ture may be explained by the fact that most positive target sites from
CLASH experiments were from coding regions and there was not
much difference in terms of conservation between the seed regions
and the ﬂanking regions of target sites in coding regions. Because
true target sites were functional and conserved, two features related

to the conservation in miRNA—mRNA stem regions and in flanking
regions around the stems, respectively, were selected.

In addition to the six selected conventional features (folding en—
ergy, seed—matching, accessibility, AU content), four new features
were selected by all four approaches (Fig. 1). These features were
the m/e motif, the length of the target site, the length of the largest
consecutive pairings and the difference between the number of
paired positions in the seed region and that in the miRNA 3’ end.
The inclusion of the m/e motif implied that there existed preferred
matching positions shared by all miRNAs. The length of the target
site was selected, showing the importance of the binding preference
of miRNAs to mRNA regions with specific lengths. The length of
the largest consecutive pairing positions mattered, which extended
the concept of seed match, as seed match was just a simple case with
a long consecutive pairing positions. The difference between the
number of paired positions in the seed region and that in the
miRNA 3’ end also suggested that the seed match may be unimport—
ant, given a high—quality 3’ end region matching. This also sup—
ported the idea that a long consecutive matching region is critical
for functional miRNA target sites.

We further investigated the importance of the 13 selected fea—
tures by the rank—sum test (Mann and Whitney, 1947) (Fig. 1). In
brief, for each selected feature, we calculated its value for all positive
target sites and for their corresponding negative target sites. We
then compared the two groups of numbers by the rank—sum test.
The numbers on the right side of Figure 1 showed the P—values of
the corresponding features. All 13 selected features had a significant
difference between the positive target sites and negative sites (P—val—
ue < 1.95 e—5 ). Some significant features based on the rank—sum test
were not selected by the four machine learning methods, which may
be due to the fact that the contribution from the combination of the
selected 13 features can already replace that of these removed fea—
tures. In fact, we calculated the correlation between every pair of the
18 features and found that the discarded significant features correl—
ate well with certain important features (Supplementary File S3).

3.2 TaeriR had a >55% recall and a >19.1% precision

prediction. It applied the random forests approach instead of the
other three approaches because when tested on five testing datasets,
the random—forests—based approach always gave better recalls and
precisions (Table 1).

To investigate the recall and precision of TaeriR, we tested it
on the five testing datasets described in Material and Methods . The
precision and recall of TaeriR in each set of test data were shown
in Table 1. Since the TaeriR predictors built on each of the five
training datasets had similar precision and recall, we chose the first
TaeriR predictor in our developed tool and in the following ana—
lyses. TaeriR had a 55.1% recall and a 19.1% precision, which
were higher than the recall and precision of existing methods re—
viewed in Reczko et al. (2011). Note that TaeriR had a much
smaller precision and recall than the above four methods (columns
2—5 in Table 1), because it predicted target sites from the entire
mRNA sequences instead of the 8514 sites that were not used for
training.

3.3 TaeriR predicted the majority of true target sites in
independent datasets

To investigate whether TaeriR was able to predict true target sites
in non—CLASH datasets, we applied it to two PAR—CLIP datasets in
the HEK293 cell (Material and Methods). There were 16 041 ‘true’
target sites in 10 023 mRNAs from the first dataset (dataset I).
Moreover, the reads of the top 60 miRNAs and top 120 miRNAs ac—
counted for more than 90% and 99%, respectively, of the total
PAR-CLIP reads in this dataset. By inputting 60 miRNAs and 10
023 mRNAs, TaeriR predicted 240 605 target sites, which
included 74.2% of true target sites (Table 2). Similarly, by inputting
120 miRNAs and 10 023 mRNAs, TaeriR predicted 481 135 tar—
get sites, which included 86.3% of true target sites (Table 2). The
percentages of correctly predicted true target sites should be con—
sidered underestimated, as a portion of true target sites may not be
target sites of the 60 or 120 miRNAs. By considering the 16 041
‘true’ target sites as all target sites in these mRNAs, we found that
TaeriR had a >74% recall in this dataset (Table 2). For the second
PAR—CLIP dataset (dataset II), there were 43 251 ‘true’ target sites
in 17 794 mRNAs. Because the cell was the same as that in the first
PAR—CLIP dataset, we assumed that mainly 60 or 120 miRNAs
related to these target sites. Similarly, we found that TaeriR was
able to identify 79.3% and 89.8% of ‘true’ target sites, when input—
ting 60 miRNAs and 120 miRNAs, respectively, together with the
17 794 mRNAs (Table 2).

The above analyses demonstrated the successful performance of
TaeriR in the human dataset in the same cell type. It was unclear
how well TaeriR performed in other species and in other cell
types. We thus applied TaeriR to a third independent dataset, the
mouse HITS—CLIP dataset in the cortex cell (dataset III). There were
119 potential miRNAs and 2953 mRNAs involved in a total of 11

080 target sites. With the input of these 119 miRNAs and 2953
mRNAs, TaeriR predicted 285 491 target sites in total. There
were 10 766 of the 11 080 (97.2%) target sites predicted by
TaeriR (Table 2).

In addition to the above analyses on the crosslinking—based data,
we tested TaeriR using the annotated miRNA—mRNA interactions
in TarBase 7.0 (dataset IV) (Table 2). For the top 50 miRNAs and
the corresponding 9823 target mRNAs, TaeriR predicted 52.3%
of true target mRNAs (Methods). For the top 100 miRNAs and the
corresponding 9869 target mRNAs, TaeriR predicted 52.6% of
true target mRNAs (Table 2) (Methods).

3.4 TaeriR showed superior performance to existing
approaches

We compared TaeriR with two widely used tools miRanda
(Enright et al., 2004), targetScan V2010 (Friedman et al., 2009;
Grimson et al., 2007), targetScan V2015 (Agarwal et al., 2015) and
a recently published tool, miRmap (Vejnar and Zdobnov, 2012;
Vejnar et al., 2013). The comparison was made on the CLASH data—
set, the three independent datasets and the two databases described
above. Overall, TaeriR with the default cutoff 0.5 had a much
higher recall and precision than the three existing methods on the
CLASH dataset (Table 3). For instance, TaeriR had a recall of
55.1%, which was at least 10% higher than other approaches.
TaeriR had a precision of 19.1%, which was at least 0.2% higher
than other approaches.

On the three independent datasets, we compared TaeriR with
the other three methods, including two versions of TargetScan
(Table 2). Overall, TaeriR had a similar or much smaller number
of predicted target sites, while it had much more known miRNA tar-
get sites predicted in each dataset. By assuming the CCRs from
PAR-CLIP and target sites from HITS—CLIP were the only true
miRNA target sites in the corresponding mRNAs in the correspond—
ing datasets, we found that TaeriR had a recall at least 3.9%
higher than other methods, and a precision at least 0.5% higher
than other methods. Note that the performance of all five methods
was relatively high in the mouse dataset than other independent
datasets, because miRNA—mRNA interactions in this dataset were
mainly inferred and majorly based on seed regions (Chi et al., 2009).

For the known miRNA—mRNA interactions in TarBase 7.0, we
also compared TaeriR with other three methods (Table 2).
TaeriR had a similar or slightly larger number of predicted inter—
actions, while it predicted much more known miRNA—mRNA inter-
actions. Similar to the results on crosslinking—based datasets,
TaeriR had a much higher recall and a higher precision than other
methods.

We also compared the running speed of the all methods. Because
TaeriR was a machine learning based method and it calculated
more features, it was much slower than miRanda and TargetScan.

machine learning—based method. It was worth pointing out that, al—
though TaeriR was relatively slow, its speed was reasonable. For
instance, it took TaeriR about 7940 CPU s to predict target sites
of 20 miRNAs in 400 mRNA sequences, on average each 2000 nt
long.

4 Discussion

In this study, we identified seven new features together with six con—
ventional features of miRNA target sites. Based on these 13 selected
features, we developed a new approach called TaeriR to predict
miRNA target sites. We tested TaeriR on a human CLASH data—
set, two human PAR—CLIP datasets, a mouse HITS—CLIP dataset
and a general dataset from TarBase 7.0, and showed that TaeriR
performed at least the same or better than three existing approaches.
TaeriR is freely available at http://hulab.ucf.edu/research/projects/
miRNA/TaeriIU.

Not all new features were completely new. We claimed some fea—
tures as new because they were not used by most of the existing
tools, such as miRanda (Enright et al., 2004), TargetScan (Friedman

(Maragkakis et al., 2009; Paraskevopoulou et al., 2013), rna22—gui
(Loher and Rigoutsos, 2012), TargetMiner (Bandyopadhyay and
Mitra, 2009), PITA (Kertesz et al., 2007) and RNAhybrid (Kruger
and Rehmsmeier, 2006). However, several new features were men—
tioned in previous studies directly or indirectly. For instance,
Thomson et al. (2011) stated that ‘some validated miRNA target
sites do not have a complete seed match but instead exhibit 11—12
continuous base pairs in the central region of the miRNA’. We
observed similar target sites in the CLASH dataset and proposed the
feature ‘The length and position of the longest consecutive pairs’.

The selected new features significantly improved the prediction
accuracy of TaeriR. To show the contribution of the new features
to the accuracy of TaeriR, we removed the seven new features and
retrained random forests in TaeriR. Compared with the original
TaeriR with 13 features, the recall and precision of the modified
TaeriR dropped 8.6% and 9.7%, respectively.

We also compared the predicted true target sites by different
approaches (Supplementary File S4). TaeriR had the largest
number of predicted true sites shared by other tools. However,
the percentage of shared true target sites predicted by TaeriR
was lower than that of other tools, suggesting that TaeriR

complements existing tools by predicting sites that cannot be pre— References

dicted by other tools. In fact, there are 2090 ‘non—seed—matching’
sites in the first CLASH test dataset. TaeriR was able to identify
1585 (75.8%) of those sites. On the other hand, miRanda and
TargetScan were only able to predict 173 (8.28%) and 34 (1.6%)
sites, respectively. This also suggested that the traditional tools
like TargetScan and miRanda almost cannot predict non—seed—
matching binding sites.

It is also worth mentioning that CLASH experiments may pick
up direct and indirect miRNA target sites. The Argonaut proteins
are guided by miRNAs to bind mRNAs, which is referred to as
miRNA—dependent recruitment and results in direct miRNA target
sites. There is also a miRNA—independent Argonaut protein recruit—
ment mechanism, in which Argonaut proteins are recruited to target
mRNAs by protein—protein interaction with RNA-binding proteins
and thus miRNAs do not interact with the mRNAs directly
(Meister, 2013). In the future, one may want to distinguish these
two types of target sites from the CLASH experiments before train-
ing predictors for target site prediction. In this way, we may also ob—
tain better features and improve the prediction accuracy.

Because of the existence of indirect target sites in CLASH data,
the recall of TaeriR on the CLASH testing datasets may be under—
estimated. In fact, TaeriR had a much higher recall on the three in-
dependent human and mouse datasets, suggesting that TaeriR
may have a recall larger than 74%. On the other hand, TaeriR
had a much lower precision on the independent datasets, which may
be underestimated as well. This was because we treated all segments
other than the CCRs or identified miRNA target sites in these inde—
pendent datasets as true negative target sites, which may not be the
case.

By the time of this study, only one CLASH dataset was publicly
available (Helwak et al., 2013). This human CLASH dataset was
used to train TaeriR. We applied TaeriR to human and mouse
datasets and demonstrated that it works well on these datasets. In
the future, with more CLASH datasets available, more important
miRNA target site features including tissue—specific features may be
discovered and the accuracy of TaeriR, especially its precision,
may be further improved.

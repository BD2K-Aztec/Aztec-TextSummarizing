ABSTRACT

Motivation: An important class of protein interactions involves the
binding of a protein’s domain to a short linear motif (SLiM) on its
interacting partner. Extracting such motifs, either experimentally or
computationally, is challenging because of their weak binding and
high degree of degeneracy. Recent rapid increase of available protein
structures provides an excellent opportunity to study SLiMs directly
from their 3D structures.

Results: Using domain interface extraction (Diet), we characterized
452 distinct SLiMs from the Protein Data Bank (PDB), of which 155
are validated in varying degrees—40 have literature validation, 54
are supported by at least one domain—peptide structural instance,
and another 61 have overrepresentation in high-throughput PPI
data. We further observed that the lacklustre coverage of existing
computational SLiM detection methods could be due to the common
assumption that most SLiMs occur outside globular domain regions.
198 of 452 SLiM that we reported are actually found on domain—
domain interface; some of them are implicated in autoimmune
and neurodegenerative diseases. We suggest that these SLiMs
would be useful for designing inhibitors against the pathogenic
protein complexes underlying these diseases. Our findings show
that 3D structure-based SLiM detection algorithms can provide a
more complete coverage of SLiM-mediated protein interactions than
current sequence-based approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions are vital to virtually every biological
process. Some important biological processes, such as the signaling
pathways, require protein—protein interactions that are designed for
fast response to stimuli. These interactions are usually transient,
easily formed and disrupted, and speciﬁc. While other protein—
protein interactions are mediated by the binding of two large globular
domain interfaces (domain—domain interactions), these transient
interactions typically involve the binding of a protein domain to

a short stretch (3—10) of amino acid residues, which is usually
characterized by a simple sequence pattern, i.e. a short linear
motif (SLiM). We call these domain—SUM interactions. Numerous
well—known and biologically important domains such as SH2, SH3,
WW, 14—3—3, FHA and PDZ (Puntervoll et al., 2003) have been
found to interact with their partners via domain—SLiM interactions.
The small binding areas on the SLiMs result in weak binding
afﬁnity (Neduva and Russell, 2005) that makes them suitable for
mediating the transient interactions (Pawson and Nash, 2003).
Compared with the larger domain—domain interaction interfaces,
domain—SLiM interfaces are also better candidates for intervention
by small molecules (Neduva and Russell, 2006).

However, current wet lab experiments for detecting SLiMs are
laborious and time consuming. It is also a challenge to detect these
motifs in silico, due to their short length and highly degenerative
nature (Neduva and Russell, 2005). One popular approach is to
mine SLiMs that are overrepresented in a set of non—homologous
proteins known to be interacting with a particular protein/domain
or known to share a similar biological function [e.g. DILIMOT
(Neduva et al., 2005) and SLiMFinder (Edwards et al., 2007)].
Another line of computational approach ﬁnds SLiMs from sets of
densely interacting protein pairs, for example, the work of Li et al.
(2006) and D—STAR (Tan et al., 2006). There are several drawbacks
with these approaches. First, as the SLiMs are highly degenerative,
most of these algorithms mask conserved structured regions (which
are assumed not to have many SLiMs) such as globular domains
to reduce false positives. Recently, it was found that such ﬁltering
has caused some true motifs to be missed (Edwards et al., 2007).
Second, the motifs identiﬁed via the sequence—based approaches are
not guaranteed to occur on the binding interface. Such atomic level
of details can only come from high—resolution 3D structures (Aloy
and Russell, 2006). Third, the algorithms are highly dependent on
the accuracy of the interaction identiﬁcation experiments. However,
these interaction data are well known to be noisy (von Mering et al.,
2002).

The rapid increase of protein structure data in the Protein Data
Bank (PDB) database (Berman et al., 2000) offers an excellent
opportunity to detect SLiMs directly from 3D structures instead of
the proteins’ sequences. Some researchers have begun to exploit
the structural data by using the structures as templates to ﬁnd seed
binding motifs, which are subsequently enriched using the available
Protein—Protein Interaction (PPI) data (Betel et al., 2007). They
therefore suffer from the accuracy and coverage limitations of the
PPI data like the previous methods. In this work, we directly ﬁnd de

SLiM on Diet: short linear motifs on domain interfaces

 

novo SLiMs on domain interfaces extracted from 3D structures of
protein—protein interactions (domain interface extraction or Diet).
The SLiMs are extracted from structurally clustered domain—SLiM
interaction classes for all PFAM domains that have available
structures in the PDB database.

Our SLiMDIet method comprises two steps: (i) Domain interface
clustering: interaction interfaces belonging to the same domain
are grouped together and classiﬁed using structural clustering; and
(ii) SLiM extraction: interaction interfaces in each domain interface
cluster are structurally aligned and the corresponding SLiM is
extracted from the alignment. We reported 452 distinct SLiMs found
on the domain interaction interfaces where 40 of them are known
in the literature, 54 have at least one supporting domain—short
peptide structure (a PDB structure which shows that a single short
peptide instance of the SLiM is sufﬁcient for binding the protein
domain) and another 61 SLiMs are found to be overrepresented
in the PPI data collected from the BioGRID (Breitkreutz et al.,
2008).

Our data also revealed that the common assumption that SLiMs
occur outside the globular domain regions could be a cause
for the lacklustre coverage of current SLiM detection methods
(Edwards et al., 2007; Neduva et al., 2005). Among the 452
distinct SLiMs that we reported, 198 of them have been detected
on domain—domain interaction interfaces (we call these domain—
domain SLiMs). Current SLiM detection methods are not amenable
to mining these domain—domain SLiMs since they rely on a motif ’s
overrepresentation over a set of non—homologous protein sequences.
It is virtually impossible to detect the overrepresentation of a
domain—domain SLiM using sequence—based methods since the
domain’s homology would overwhelm the SLiM’s much weaker
similarity.

We conducted a further study on four novel domain—domain
SLiMs, which we have found. The ﬁrst one is a domain—domain
SLiM bound by the tumor necrosis factor (TNF; ID: PF00229)
domain on the BAFF proteins that have been implicated in
B—cell hyperplasia and development of severe autoimmune diseases
(Gross et al., 2000; Khare et al., 2000). A previous experiment
reported in the literature has showed that an instance of our
predicted SLiM (a short peptide DLLVRHWV) can prevent the
pathogenic condition from BAFF overexpression (Gordon et al.,
2003). Another domain—domain SLiM of interest is a novel
SLiM found on the dimer interfaces of the glyceraldehyde—3—
phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) enzyme, which is associated
with neurodegenerative disorders such as Huntington’s disease,
Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease and Machado—Joseph
disease (Berry and Boulton, 2000; Tatton et al., 2003). We
also discovered two SLiMs that are implicated in amyloid ﬁbril
formation implicated in several debilitating human diseases such as
Alzheimer’s disease, prion—based encephalopathies, liver cirrhosis
and lung emphysema (Carrell and Gooptu, 1998). The class of
domain—domain SLiMs could, therefore, be particularly useful for
designing inhibitors to disrupt the domain—domain interactions,
which underlie the formation of pathogenic protein complexes.

In conclusion, the ﬁne atomic details offered by structural data
made them an attractive data source for discovering SLiMs that are
beyond the coverage of existing sequence—based methods. With the
number of available protein structures expecting to grow rapidly,
we can expect to discover even more biologically signiﬁcant novel
SLiMs in the near future.

2 METHODS

2.1 SLiMDIet’s workﬂow

In this study, we devised a method named SLiMDIet, a de novo SLiM
discovery method by Diet from 3D protein structure data. SLiMDIet consists
of two steps: a Diet step, followed by a SLiM step. The Diet step takes a
set of protein structures from PDB as input, ﬁnds all known domains within
the input structures and extracts the domain interfaces associated with each
of them. A domain interface comprises two sets of amino acid residues: one
found along a domain chain (the set is called the domain face) while the other
on a partner chain (partner face), which are in close vicinity of each other. The
interaction interfaces of each domain are then clustered based on structural
similarity. The resulting domain interface clusters represent various modes
of interactions for the domain. In the SLiM step, we conduct an approximate
structural multiple alignment to align the domain faces and the partner faces
in each cluster. We then check if the alignment of the partner faces contains
any conserved linear region (called a ‘block’) of length 3—12 residues. To
ensure robustness, we require that a block is constructed only from non—
homologous partner chains and we require at least four of them. Finally, we
construct a (linear) gapped position speciﬁc scoring matrix (PSSM) from
the block to represent the predicted SLiMs. An illustration of SLiMDIet
algorithm can be seen in Figure 1.

2.2 Domain identiﬁcation

A structural dataset was downloaded from PDB on August 24, 2009,
containing 57 559 structures. We chose structures containing at least one
protein chain and whose resolution is 3.0 A or better, giving a total of 54 981
legible structures with 130 488 protein chains. PFAM domain annotations
on each PDB chain are computed by running the hmmpfam program from
the HMMER library version 2.3.2 (Eddy, 1998) using the latest PFAM 23.0
library (Bateman et al., 2004).

We use PFAM (Bateman et al., 2004) as our choice of protein domain
deﬁnition as opposed to SCOP (Andreeva et al., 2008) or CATH (Cuff
et al., 2009) because of the relatively better coverage of PFAM. PFAM
was previously reported to have 57% coverage on SWISSPROT+TREMBL
sequences, while SCOP covers 31% (Elofsson and Sonnhammer, 1999).
PFAM also has higher PDB chain coverage on the current dataset
[version 23.0, released July 2008, covering 112424 chains (86.16%
coverage)] as compared to SCOP [version 1.75, dated June 2009, covering
87 064 chains (66.72% coverage)] and CATH [version 3.2.0, dated July 2008,
covering 86 105 chains (65.99% coverage)]. However, PFAM domain does
have its own limitation. It currently does not deﬁne structural domains that
are formed by multiple protein chains. Nevertheless, one can always apply
SLiMDIet on SCOP/CATH domain deﬁnition without major change on the
program.

2.3 Interface extraction

For each PDB structure, we ﬁnd the PFAM domains in its chains. For each
domain, we computed the domain interfaces as follows. First, we deﬁne
the distance between two amino acid residues to be the nearest distance
between any pair of non—hydrogen atoms between the two residues. As done
in PSIMAP (Dafas et al., 2004), we also use a contact distance cutoff of
5 A here.

A domain interface comprises two sets of amino acid residues: the domain
and partner faces. Each amino acid on one face must be within the deﬁned
contact distance from some amino acid on the other face. The residues on each
face must originate from a single protein chain (named domain and partner
chain, respectively). However, they need not be located consecutively in their
respective chains. For the domain face, the residues must also be within a
single protein domain region of the domain chain.

To curb possible non—biological (crystal) interfaces, which are generally
of smaller area, we set a threshold of having domain interfaces involving a
minimum of eight amino acids on the domain face and four amino acids on

Fig. 1. SLiMDIet’s overview. The domain interfaces of each PFAM domain
are clustered by their structural similarity. Next, from each cluster, the domain
and partner faces are structurally aligned and we build a gapped PSSM
based on the contacts on the partner faces. The gapped PSSM has ﬂexible
gaps deﬁned by the minimum and maximum gaps observed between two
consecutive PSSM positions. We deﬁne a gapped PSSM as linear when the
total length of its non—gap positions is 3—12 residues with gaps of at most
four residues between any consecutive residue positions. To detect domain—
SLiM interfaces, we collect domain interface clusters whose partner faces
are covered by a linear gapped PSSM.

the partner face. This lower bound corresponds to a binding area >800 A2—
which is roughly the average size of a domain interface (Kim et al., 2006).
For intrachain domain interfaces, we also require that the residues on the
partner face are not within 10 residues from the ends of the domain, to avoid
recognizing local contacts as interaction interfaces. This resulted in 270 739
domain interfaces involving 4780 PFAM domains.

2.4 Pairwise structural alignment within each domain
interface group
To classify similar interfaces that correspond to the same domain interaction

class, we deﬁne the similarity of two interfaces using the modiﬁed1 S—score
function from (Alexandrov and Fischer, 1996) as follows:

; L
(1+A) min(IAI,IBI)

S norm 2

 

1The function is normalized by the size of the interface and scaled to yield
similarity score between 0 and 1.

where A is the root mean square distance (RMSD) between the two structures
being aligned, N the number of aligned residues between the two interfaces,
and |A| and |B| the sizes of the aligned interfaces.

Usually, the RMSD between two proteins is approximated by the RMSD
of their backbone’s COL atoms. Since SLiMDIet’s domain interfaces only
consist of the contact residues (instead of the whole protein or domain), the
COL representation is rather inadequate. To capture the similarity better, we
measure the similarity of two interfaces using the backbone and side chain
conformation of the residues on each interface. We use the C atom position
to represent the direction of the side chain with respect to its backbone COL
(a similar CB approximation was mentioned in Torrance et al., 2005).

When comparing two interfaces, we treat both domain and partner faces
of each domain interface as one rigid continuous structure. We designed
MatAlignAB for comparing domain interfaces, a modiﬁed algorithm of
MatAlign (Aung and Tan, 2006), which only aligns residues from the same
face type (i.e. residues from domain face in one interface can only be aligned
to residues in the domain face of the other) and aligns atoms of the same
atom type [i.e. COL (CB, respectively) to COL (CB, respectively)]. As with
the original algorithm, MatAlignAB produces alignments that follow the
sequential ordering of the residues within their respective domain and partner
sequences. The ﬁnal results of this step consist of the similarity scores and
pairwise alignments among all pairs of domain interfaces of each domain.

2.5 Hierarchical agglomerative clustering on the
domain interfaces using average linkage

For every domain, we cluster its interfaces into domain interface clusters
by following the steps of hierarchical agglomerative clustering algorithm
using average linkage, where the similarity of two clusters is deﬁned to be
the average pairwise similarity between all the members of the two clusters
(as done in Kim et al., 2006). The algorithm starts by setting every domain
interface as a cluster with one member. Next, it picks the pair of clusters that
has the highest pairwise similarity and combine the pair. Then, it computes
the average similarity of the combined cluster with the rest of the cluster.
The latter two steps are repeated until the similarity score between every
possible pair of the clusters is below a certain threshold. In SLiMDIet, we
use the following range of thresholds 0.15, 0.2, 0.25 and 0.3 to generate sets
of (possibly overlapping) clusters each under the corresponding threshold
level. For those clusters that have >70% overlap, we group them together and
report one of the clusters as the representative (see Supplementary Material
2 for details).

2.6 Quantiﬁcation of the clustering performance

Suppose C is a cluster of domain interfaces computed by a particular
algorithm and R the reference cluster [in our case, R is the set of domain
interfaces (manually) grouped according to the literature]. We use the
F -score, which is the harmonic mean of the sensitivity and speciﬁcity scores
(Rij sbergen, 1979), to quantify the similarity of the predicted cluster C and
the reference cluster R.

2 x Spec(C,R) >< Sens(C,R)

 

F —score 2
(CR) SPCC(C,R) + SCHS(C,R)

where Spec(C,R) is the speciﬁcity of the cluster C with respect to a reference
cluster R, which is computed by Spec(C,R)=|C ﬂ R|/|C|. Sens(C,R) is the
sensitivity of the cluster C with respect to R, which is computed by
Sens(C,R)=|C (I RI/IRI.

The F —score of an algorithm for a particular reference cluster R is the best
score among its computed cluster C. The F —score measure is used to compare
the clustering performance of SLiMDIet to SCOWLP’s on the benchmark
data.

SLiM on Diet: short linear motifs on domain interfaces

 

2.7 SLiM extraction from the interface clusters

We employ a PSSM with ﬂexible gaps, called gapped PSSM to deﬁne the
binding motif on the interaction interfaces. The gaps are deﬁned between
any two consecutive positions in the PSSM.

Given a cluster of domain interfaces, the construction of a gapped PSSM
is performed in two steps. First, interfaces from the same cluster are
aligned to the cluster center, which is the domain interface with the best
average similarity to the rest of the interfaces in a cluster, to generate an
approximate multiple interface alignment of the interfaces. Then, we ensure
that the alignment contains four non—homologous interfaces. An interface
Ia is deﬁned as homologous to 1;, when Ia and Ib’s aligned residues in the
alignment are exactly the same and their full partner chains share >50%
sequence similarity. This means that two interfaces whose partner chains
share high sequence similarity can still be deﬁned as non—homologous as
long as their aligned interface residues differs.

In the alignment of the non—homologous interfaces, a block is deﬁned
as a set of 3—12 consecutive alignment positions with gaps of at most four
residues in between. The SLiM corresponding to an interface alignment is
computed from the longest block in it. A SLiM is said to be covering an
interface when it covers at least half of the contact residues on the partner
face of that interface. To make sure that the computed SLiM represents the
interfaces of a domain interface cluster, we require it to cover at least half
of the non—redundant interfaces in it.

With a block that satisﬁes the coverage constraint, we construct a
gapped PSSM by extrapolating the score of all 20 amino acids based on
the BLOSUM62 substitution score (Henikoff and Henikoff, 2005) of all
observed amino acids in each column in the block. The detailed steps of
the gapped PSSM construction is included in Supplementary Material 1
(Section 2). From 39170 domain clusters with at least four members,
SLiMDIet found 7473 with at least four non—homologous interfaces. Out
of these, only 1592 met the coverage constraint. We then grouped interface
clusters from different similarity cutoffs when they have at least 70% member
overlap. The grouping yields 452 distinct gapped PSSMs involving 280
PFAM domains. The full listing of SLiMDIet’s predicted SLiMs and their
gapped PSSM are listed in Supplementary Material 2.

2.8 Computing the statistical signiﬁcance of the SLiM
using PPI data

When a SLiM is extracted from a particular domain—SLiM interface clusters,
we conduct statistical tests to see if the motif occurs signiﬁcantly more in the
interaction partners of the domain as compared to any random interaction.
Given a protein sequence S, the gapped PSSM score of one particular
position j in S is just the maximum sum of the gapped PSSM’s residue scores
starting at j over all possible gap combination in the PSSM. For example,
the best score of position 0 in the string FSDTK based on the gapped PSSM2

L:4.62 T:2.4
IF:1.38I{1’2}ID:—0.12IWOUId be

1.38+(—0.12) (gapzl),
maXI1.38+2.4 (gap=2).

For a position in a protein with a gapped PSSM score s, it is deﬁned as an
occurrence of the PSSM if the probability of scoring s or better by random
is at most equal to 104. To this end, we created 10000 random protein
sequences, each of length 500, with their amino acid distribution following
the one observed in our PPI data from BioGRID (Breitkreutz et al., 2008). For
each gapped PSSM, we computed the scores of all positions in the random
dataset (of approximately 5 million positions) and sorted the scores in non—
increasing order. The 500th score on the sorted score list would have an
empirical P—value of 10‘4 and is chosen as the cutoff score for the occurrence
of the gapped PSSM.

 

2This is a mini—version of gapped PSSM for exemplary purpose, the real
gapped PSSM would have scores for all 20 amino acids.

Given a SLiM’s gapped PSSM, the probability of observing a certain
number of occurrences in the partners of a protein domain by random can
be computed by the standard hypergeometric distribution function

(IIMI  (III—IIMI) )
IIDMI (IIDI — IIDMI)

(1'12")

where I is the whole set of the high—throughput PPI data, IM the subset of I
that contain an occurrence of the motif M, ID the subset of I containing
the domain D and IDM the subset of ID that contain an instance of M.
The correctness of the hypergeometric scoring function on the PPI data is
presented in Supplementary Material 1 (Section 5).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Both known and novel SLiMs are discovered

SLiMDIet detected 452 distinct SLiMs from the whole PDB dataset
(dated August 2009). Forty of that are known in the literature.
Amongst the remaining 412 candidate novel SLiMs, 54 have at
least an instance of a domain—short peptide structure in their
respective domain—SLiM clusters. The presence of such a domain—
short peptide structure is a strong indicator that the domain is capable
of binding a linear peptide deﬁned by the predicted SLiM. Indeed,
all of the literature—backed SLiMs have at least one domain—short
peptide structure.

From the remaining 358 candidate novel SLiMs, we found 61
are overrepresented in the interaction partners of their respective
domains within the high—throughput PPI data (P—value 5 0.05). It is
important to note that SLiMs with poor P—value are not necessarily
erroneous since the PPI data is far from complete. Indeed, as many
as 145 of the remaining 297 SLiMs (those with P—value >0.05)
have <10 distinct interaction data—99 of them have no PPI data
support at all. This shows the limitation of SLiM detection methods
that relied solely or heavily on PPI data.

3.2 SLiMs with validations from the literature

We compared our predicted SLiMs with those listed in the ELM
(Puntervoll et al., 2003) and MiniMotif database (Balla et al.,
2006). SLiMDIet reported 40 SLiMs with strong similarity with
the known SLiMs in literature. Since there is a signiﬁcant overlap in
the entries of ELM and MiniMotif, most of our SLiMs correspond
to more than one database entry in both databases. In summary, our
SLiMs covered 30 out of 136 known ELM SLiMs and 72 of 524
MiniMotif SLiMs (from the publicly available MiniMotif version 1).
The coverage is signiﬁcant considering that the SLiMs are solely
computed from a more limited structural data source. The detailed
listing of the 40 SLiMs with their corresponding literature SLiM is
given in Supplementary Material 4.

As a comparison, we also checked the discovery of these
literature—backed SLiMs in the proﬁles collected by D—MIST (Betel
et al., 2007). D—MIST, like SLiMDIet, constructs binding proﬁles of
different domains based on the structural data. However, it relies on
the high—throughput PPI data to reﬁne their predicted motifs. Out of
the 40 literature—backed SLiMs found by SLiMDIet, we could only
ﬁnd the corresponding D—MIST proﬁles for nine of them. For the
missing 31 SLiMs, D—MIST did not have any proﬁle related to the
SLiM’s domain for 24 of them and for the remaining seven SliMs,
D—MIST’s proﬁles are too divergent from the literature SLiMs.

Such poor coverage could be due to the fact that D—MIST was
collected from a subset of PDB (10064 structures). However, we
observe that even the older, well—studied SLiMs recognized by
domains like SH2(Grb2), WW, FHA, PDZ and PID(PTB) were also
missing. We present the detailed listing of matched D—MIST proﬁles
in the Supplementary Material 5.

4 DISCUSSION

4.1 Different SLiM classes have different interface
geometries

It has been known that some SLiM—recognizing domains can bind
multiple classes of SLiMs. The SH3 domain, for example, is known
to recognize two classes of SLiMs; [KRY]..P..P (SH3 class 1 SLiM)
and P..P.[KR] (SH3 class 2 SLiM) (Puntervoll et al., 2003). We
hypothesize that the existence of such different classes of SLiM that
can bind to the same domain is due to observable differences in their
corresponding domain interface geometries. In other words, one can
differentiate domain—SLiM interfaces belonging to different classes
of SLiMs through geometric comparison.

To verify our conjecture, we hand—curated a benchmark set of 230
domain—SLiM interfaces from three well—studied domains—SH2
(123 interfaces), SH3 (80 interfaces) and 14—3—3 (27 interfaces)—
whose interaction classes are well annotated in the literature.
The detailed listing of the benchmark interfaces is given in the
Supplementary Material 3.

We compare the structural clustering of SLiMDIet with an
existing domain interface clustering method SCOWLP (Teyra et al.,
2008) on the benchmark clusters. Table 1 shows that SLiMDIet’s
clustering has better average speciﬁcity, sensitivity and F —score
for all three domains in the benchmark. However, we should note

We collected the interfaces of the SH2, SH3 and 14-3-3 domains whose domain—SLiM
interaction class is deﬁned in their respective reference papers. The grouping from
the literature constitutes the reference clusters, against which the accuracy of both
SLiMDIet and SCOWLP are computed. The cases where one method outperforms the
other are printed in bold.

interfaces. The discussion on the performance of both methods on
each benchmark domain is presented in Supplementary Material 3.
The overall high correspondence of SLiMDIet’s structural clusters
with the literature reference clusters indicates that different classes
of domain—SLiM interfaces indeed are associated with different
domain interface geometries. It also shows that SLiMDIet, which
took in account the interface geometries of the SLiMs, is more
suitable for domain—SLiM interface clustering as compared with
such an existing domain interface clustering method as SCOWLP.

4.2 Known and Novel SLiMs are found on
domain—domain interaction interfaces

Interestingly, we observed that 198 of the total 452 predicted SLiMs
are domain—domain SLiMs. A domain—domain SLiM is a SLiM
found in an interface cluster with at least four non—homologous
interfaces whose partner faces occur within some (not necessarily the
same) PFAM domain. We found two of our 198 reported domain—
domain SLiMs have literature support. They are the SH3_1 and
ubiquitin domain. All of the instances of our predicted SLiM for
ubiquitin are found within a domain called ubiquitin interacting
motif (UIM, ID: PF02809). We also found another six domain—
domain SLiMs with supporting domain—short peptide structures
and 35 with overrepresentation in the PPI data. We also observe
that 143 out of 198 domain—domain SLiMs that we found are
overrepresented in their respective PFAM domains. The complete
listing of the domain—domain SLiMs and the procedure to compute
their overrepresentation within the PFAM domain in which they are
found are given in Supplementary Material 6.

Finding such domain—domain SLiMs can be an important
discovery since it is commonly believed that SLiMs occur outside
the globular domain regions (Puntervoll et al., 2003). In fact, most
of the current SLiM detection methods remove domain regions from
the search space (Edwards et al., 2007; Neduva et al., 2005) because
of this belief. The discovery of such domain—domain SLiMs also
indicates that many of the apparent domain—domain interactions
could be mediated by domain—SLiM interactions. Indeed, a recent
study had actually found genuine occurrences of ELM SLiMs on
the accessible parts of a globular domain (Via et al., 2009).

One particularly interesting novel domain—domain SLiM found
by SLiMDIet is a SLiM that is bound by the GAPDH, C—terminal
(Gp_dh_C) domain (ID: PF02800). The Gp_dh_C domain is the
C—terminal domain of GAPDH enzyme. The enzyme exists as
a tetramer of identical chains, each containing two conserved
functional domains, the Gp_dh_N (ID: PF00044) and Gp_dh_C
(ID: PF02800) domain. Figure 2A shows the structure of half of the
tetramer, comprising of two chains of GAPDH (one chain on the left
and one on the right). Figure 2B and C illustrates only the Gp_dh_C
domain surfaces with the linear peptide regions of Gp_dh_N on
them.

GAPDH has an important role in glycolysis and gluconeogenesis,
and it is also involved in the signaling mechanism for programmed
cell death (apoptosis; Berry and Boulton, 2000). Several studies
associated the enzyme with neurodegenerative disorders such as
Huntington’s disease, Alzheimer’s disease, Parkinson’s disease
and Machado—Joseph disease (Berry and Boulton, 2000; Tatton
et al., 2003). The SLiM computed by SLiMDIet for Gp_dh_C
is [YH]..[KRQ][YH]D[ST], which is found within the Gp_dh_N
domain. The predicted SLiM is found within nine non—homologous

SLiM on Diet: short linear motifs on domain interfaces

linear region on the N—terminal domain of the opposite chain (highlighted
in ball—and—stick mode). SLiMDIet’s predicted SLiM for this region is
[YH]..[KRQ][YH]D[ST]. (B) The surface representation of the Gp_dh_C

GAPDH dimers. It was reported in an earlier study that inhibition
on the formation of GADPH tetramer protects against neuronal—
induced cell—death (Fukuhara et al., 2001), a phenomenon frequently
seen in many neurogenerative diseases. Interestingly, the dimeric
and monomeric form of the enzyme retain its glycolysis and
gluconeogenesis functionality and research had shown that they have
higher catalytic activity (Minton and Wilf, 1981). We suggest that
our domain—domain SLiM could be used as a template for designing
inhibitors to disrupt the enzyme’s complex formation and keep it in
its monomeric form.

Another notable example of domain—domain SLiMs is a SLiM
interacting with the TNF domain (ID: PF00229) of BAFF proteins.
SLiMDIet predicted that it binds a SLiM D[LHS]L[LV][RH]..[IV]
on its domain partners [BaffR—Tall_bind (ID: PF09256), BCMA—
Tall_bind (ID: PF09257) and TACI—CRD2 (ID: PF09305)]. BAFF
protein overexpression was previously shown to result in B—cell
hyperplasia and development of severe autoimmune diseases (Gross
et al., 2000; Khare et al., 2000). In fact, it has already been reported
that an instance of the SLiM can confer BAFF binding and block the
signaling pathway leading to the pathogenic condition from BAFF
overexpression (Gordon et al., 2003). However, there were no TNF—
binding SLiM for BAFF reported in the literature and SLiMDIet
managed to predict one. The predicted SLiM could provide further
insights for designing more effective treatments. Figure 3 shows
two PDB structures in which two TNF domains are binding a short
peptide and a full partner domain, respectively; both containing our
predicted SLiMs.

A third domain—domain SLiM is found on the dimer interface
of RNaseA domains (ID: PF00074) of Ribonuclease protein. The

protein is known to form dimers using two modes of domain
swapping. The major mode swaps the C—terminal beta sheets (Liu
et al., 2001) while the minor mode swaps the N—terminal helix
(Liu et al., 1998). Previous experiments have shown that a peptide
instance of the N—terminal helix could compete with the minor
mode of the domain swapping and disrupt dimer formation (Liu
et al., 1998). It has also been reported that domain swapping is
one possible mechanism of amyloid ﬁbril formation (Carrell and
Gooptu, 1998; Liu et al., 2001) and based on the domain swapping
observed in RNase, Liu et al. proposed a model of amyloid ﬁbril
formation, which is stabilized by the swapped domain binding
(Liu et al., 2001). The formation of amyloid is associated with a
variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer’s disease,
Huntington’s disease and the new variant Creutzfeldt—Jakob disease
(nvCJ D). It is also implicated in other diseases such as the sickle cell
anemia, or—antitrypsin related liver cirrhosis and emphysema (Carrell
and Gooptu, 1998). In such a model, knowing the SLiM bound by
the domain would enable one to design an inhibitor to destabilize
and prevent the amyloid formation. SLiMDIet predicted two distinct
novel SLiMs that correspond to the two swapping modes of the
RNase domain, namely YVPVH[FYL] [DAN ]AS (major mode) and
AA..[FAM]ERQH.DS (minor mode).

5 CONCLUSIONS

SLiMs are important mediators of protein—protein interactions but
they are difﬁcult to detect experimentally and computationally. In
this work, we showed that it is possible to systematically detect
de novo SLiMs on domain interaction interfaces extracted directly
from structural data. The atomic level of details available in the high—
resolution 3D structures provide a rich source of data for discovering
SLiMs that are guaranteed to occur on the binding surfaces. In fact,
by mining the different domain—SLiM interaction classes from the
PDB database, our SLiMDIet method detected many novel SLiMs,
including the domain—domain SLiMs.

The discovery of domain—domain SLiMs uncovered a limitation
in the current SLiM detection approaches. These SLiMs are located
in regions that are routinely masked out by the current SLiM

detection methods. They cannot be detected simply by turning off
the masking step—the strong similarity of the domain regions would
bury the weak signal of the degenerate SLiM(s) in them. This class
of SLiM is, therefore, currently under—represented in the known
databases and literature, and they present real opportunities for
domain—domain interaction inhibitor design.

Current SLiM detection methods also rely heavily on PPI data and
are thus affected by its accuracy. An earlier study (Neduva et al.,
2005) has reported that some of the known SLiMs were not detected
in the PPI due to noisy and incomplete interaction data. In our study,
we also observed a similar problem where as many as 111 SLiMs
do not have any PPI data containing their binding domains. Among
them, two are known in the literature, namely the Toxin_1 (Scherf
et al., 1997) and fnl domains (Bingham et al., 2008) and 10 have
domain—short peptide evidences.

As the structural genomic initiatives continue to make more and
more high—quality structural data available, we can have a viable
chance of detecting the SLiMs that mediate many of our important
protein—protein interactions directly from 3D structural data. As
future work, we plan to continue to improve SLiMDIet’s capability
by reﬁning the notion of interface similarity to take into account the
interface residues’ chemical properties and their connectivity within
the domain interfaces.

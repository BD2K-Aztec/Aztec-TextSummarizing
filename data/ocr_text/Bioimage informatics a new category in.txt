The last two decades have witnessed great advances in biological
tissue labeling and automated microscopic imaging that, in turn,
have revolutionized how biologists visualize molecular, sub-cellular,
cellular, and super-cellular structures and study their respective
functions. Tremendous volumes of multi-dimensional bioimaging
data are now being generated in almost every branch of biology.
How to interpret such image datasets in a quantitative, objective,
automatic and efﬁcient way has become a major challenge in
current computational biology. Bioimage informatics methods have
begun to turn image data into useful biological knowledge (Peng,
2008; Swedlow, et al., 2009; Shamir, et al., 2010; Danuser, 2011).
The essential methods of bioimage informatics involve large-
scale bioimage generation, visualization, analysis and management.
Bioimage informatics also encompasses both hypothesis- and data-
driven exploratory approaches, with an emphasis on how to generate
biological knowledge and/or gain new insights that would otherwise
be hard to achieve.

Early work in bioimage informatics began in the late 1990s.
Increasingly, computer vision, image analysis, data mining, machine
learning and pattern recognition methods have been applied to
microscopic images to extract biological information and to generate
ontology databases. The growing amount of bioimage data are
quickly imposing additional demands on how to store, manage and
retrieve such image datasets as well as the associated secondary
meta-data. Data analysis, fusion and reconstruction techniques have
also been developed to facilitate better image acquisition and
formation. Joint analysis of image data in combination with other
biological datasets, such as genomes and gene expression proﬁles,
is also becoming more and more commonplace.

To meet the need of this growing ﬁeld, the ﬁrst international
workshop on Bioimage Informatics was organized at Stanford
University in 2005. It grew to be an annual event in this ﬁeld.
Other meetings on similar topics and related applications have also
emerged since then. In 2010, the annual conference on Intelligent
Systems for Molecular Biology (ISMB) established a paper-
submission track on bioimaging data analysis and visualization.

While there is a noticeable need to publish high quality papers
on bioimage informatics, so far no high—impact journal explicitly
accepts this category of papers. We believe it is an appropriate time
to create this new category in Bioinformatics. As of February 2012,

Bioinformatics now includes a new paper submission category in
the scope described by the journal at its website as follows:

‘Informatics methods for the acquisition, analysis, mining
and visualization of images produced by modern microscopy,
with an emphasis on the application of novel computing
techniques to solve challenging and signiﬁcant biological
and medical problems at the molecular, sub-cellular, cellular,
and super-cellular (organ, organism, and population) levels.
This category also encourages large-scale image informatics
methods/applications/software, various enabling techniques (e. g.
cyber-infrastructures, quantitative validation experiments, pattern
recognition, etc.) for such large-scale studies, and joint analysis
of multiple heterogeneous datasets that include images as a
component. Bioimage related ontology and databases studies,
image-oriented large-scale machine learning, data mining, and
other analytics techniques are also encouraged.

We will not consider image analysis and pattern recognition
methods that are solely based on tuning parameters or swapping
computational sub-steps, without an in-depth description or
demonstration of why such changes are signiﬁcantly superior for
one or more biological problems.’

We would like to thank a number of colleagues and practitioners
who have contributed to the creation of this new category. Especially,
we thank Eugene Myers, B.S.Manjunath, Badri Roysam, Manfred
Auer, Michael Hawrylycz, J ean-Christophe Olive-Marin, Anne
Carpenter and Vebjorn Ljosa in helping to deﬁne this new category
of paper submissions. We hope the journal Bioinformatics becomes
a valuable venue for bioimage informatics researchers to publish
their most important work.

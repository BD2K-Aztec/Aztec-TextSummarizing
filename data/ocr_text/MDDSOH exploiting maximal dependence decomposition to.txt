Abstract

S—sulfenylation (S—sulphenylation, or sulfenic acid), the covalent attachment of S—hydroxyl (—SOH)
to cysteine thiol, plays a significant role in redox regulation of protein functions. Although sulfenic
acid is transient and labile, most of its physiological activities occur under control of S—hydroxyl—
ation. Therefore, discriminating the substrate site of S—sulfenylated proteins is an essential task in
computational biology for the furtherance of protein structures and functions. Research into S—sul—
fenylated protein is currently very limited, and no dedicated tools are available for the computa—
tional identification of SOH sites. Given a total of 1096 experimentally verified S—sulfenylated pro—
teins from humans, this study carries out a bioinformatics investigation on SOH sites based on
amino acid composition and solvent—accessible surface area. A TwoSampleLogo indicates that the
positively and negatively charged amino acids flanking the SOH sites may impact the formulation
of S—sulfenylation in closed three—dimensional environments. In addition, the substrate motifs of
SOH sites are studied using the maximal dependence decomposition (MDD). Based on the concept
of binary classification between SOH and non—SOH sites, Support vector machine (SVM) is applied
to learn the predictive model from MDD—identified substrate motifs. According to the evaluation re—
sults of 5—fold cross—validation, the integrated SVM model learned from substrate motifs yields an
average accuracy of 0.87, significantly improving the prediction of SOH sites. Furthermore, the inte—
grated SVM model also effectively improves the predictive performance in an independent testing
set. Finally, the integrated SVM model is applied to implement an effective web resource, named
MDD—SOH, to identify SOH sites with their corresponding substrate motifs.

Availability and implementation: The MDD—SOH is now freely available to all interested users at
http://csb.cse.yzu.edu.tw/MDDSOH/. All of the data set used in this work is also available for down—
load in the website.

(Cys—SO3H) has emerged over the last decade as an important
method of controlling protein functions through both physiologic
and oxidative stress conditions (Leonard and Carroll, 2011; Poole
and Nelson, 2008; R005 and Messens, 2011; Wani et al., 2011).
More than 200 sulfenic modifications have been identified
from transcription factors, signaling proteins, metabolic enzymes,
proteostasis regulators and cytoskeletal components. Due to the la—
bile nature and low abundance of in vivo S—sulfenylation, the detail
characteristics and mechanisms of S—sulfenylation still need to be
clarified. To our knowledge, the protein database of human, mouse
or rat only consists of ~2% cysteine residues. Both the degree of S—
sulfenylation within proteins and quantification of protein sulfenic
modification are necessary for understanding oxidative PTM
regulation.

Several chemo—proteomic strategies exist for identifying S-
sulfenylated sites with various clickable probes (Qian et al., 2013;
Szychowski et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2014; Weerapana et al., 2010;
Zheng et al., 2013), but these are very expensive. In the laboratory,
the lack of the information about sites and the multiplicity of redox
changes both lead to false—positive identifications (Yang et al.,
2014). As for the increasing number of experimentally identified S-
sulfenylated peptides, building a resource database is essential for
further biological investigation of S—sulfenylated proteins and the
substrate specificities of S—sulfenylation sites. With the development
of powerful bioinformatics technologies, these approaches are
adopted for prognostication of individual cysteine residues to S—
sulfenylation. Although several published algorithms and public
servers are available to analyze and predict the reactive state of
cysteine (Dosztanyi et al., 2003; Marino and Gladyshev, 2012) and
oxidative yet disulfide cysteine (Mucchielli—Giorgi et al., 2002;
Sun et al., 2012), no unconfirmed bio—reports exist on the specific
information of S—sulfenylated targets and substrate sites, except for
chemical approaches with over 1000 S—sulfenylation sites on >700
proteins in intact cells (Yang et al., 2014). Other potential novel
consensus S—sulfenylation motifs and substrate site specificities
remain unclear.

This work concentrates on identifying S—sulfenylation sites with
potential substrate motifs. Depending on the in silico characteriza—
tion of protein, the sequential and structural features including
amino acid composition (AAC), amino acid pair composition
(AAPC), position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM), position weight
matrix (PWM), amino acid substitution matrix (BLOSUM62) and
accessible surface area (ASA), are applied to discriminate between
the SOH sites and non—SOH sites. Additionally, this study proposes
an iteratively statistical method for recognizing S—sulfenylation sites
and promising consensus motifs by maximal dependence decompos—
ition (MDD) (Burge and Karlin, 1997). Based on the most signifi—
cant dependencies between positions, MDD allows a large group of
aligned sequence to be separated into subgroups containing charac—
teristic motifs. For each subgroup, support vector machine (SVM)
was adopted to build the predictive model for each MDD cluster.
Consequently, the ability to predict results between S—sulfenylation
sites and non— S—sulfenylation sites is significantly increased through
evaluation of 5—fold cross—validation. Furthermore, an independent
testing set, which is blind to the training dataset, was generated
from the experimental data of published database to demonstrate
the effectiveness of the proposed models in the evaluation of 5 —fold
cross—validation. To facilitate the study of protein S—sulfenylation,
the MDD—identified substrate motifs were employed to implement a
web—based resource for identifying S—sulfenylation sites with their
corresponding substrate motifs.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Data collection and pre—processing

With the newly discovered S—sulfenyl—mediated redox mechanisms
of transcription factor H1F1A by SIRT6 (Yang et al., 2014), experi-
mentally verified S—sulfenylated cysteines from humans were used as
the positive set, and all non—S—sulfenylated cysteines on these S—sulfe—
nylated proteins were used as the negative data. As shown in
Supplementary Table 81, the main dataset was gathered from
Carroll Lab (PMID: 25175731) with 1443 positive and 10 521 nega—
tive data on 987 S—sulfenylated proteins. In addition, several experi-
mentally verified S—sulfenylation sites were manually curated from
RedoxDB (Sun et al., 2012), UniProtKB and other literatures. For
the RedoxDB database, a total of 102 S—sulfenylated cysteine on 92
proteins, from human and others were used as the positive dataset,
while the rest of the cysteine residues on S—sulfenylated proteins
were regarded as the negative data (non—S—sulfenylated cysteine).
From the UniProtKB database, one S—sulfenylated protein was from
human, and the remaining one from others, where the 17S—sulfeny—
lated sites and 97 non—S—sulfenylated sites were considered as posi—
tive and negative data, respectively. The protein sulfenic acid was
detected by X—ray Crystallography (Furdui and Poole, 2014). The
positive dataset comprised 33 S—sulfenylated cysteines, while the
negative data set contained 143 non—S—sulfenylated cysteines. After
the removal of redundant data, a total of 1434 unique S—sulfenyla—
tion sites were obtained from 1096 proteins.

This study focuses on the sequence—based characterization of
substrate site motifs of S—sulfenylated cysteines. Thus, a window
length of 211 —l— 1 was utilized to extract sequence fragments that cen—
tered at the experimentally verified SOH sites and contained 11 up—
stream and n downstream ﬂanking amino acids. Given 1096 S—
sulfenylated proteins, the sequence fragments containing window
length of 211 —l— 1 amino acids and centering at cysteine residue with
the annotation of S—sulfenylation were regarded as the positive data
set (S—sulfenylated sites). Based on a window size of 21 (n : 10), the
data set contained 1434 positive data and 10 476 negative data. To
avoid overestimating the predictive performance, the CD-HIT pro-
gram (Li and Godzik, 2006) was employed to remove homologous
sequence fragments from the positive and negative datasets. CD—
HIT is an effective tool for clustering protein sequences based on a
specified sequence similarity value. One instance sequence was
chosen to represent each cluster. Owing to the incomplete informa-
tion of experimentally validated S—sulfenylation sites, based on the
analysis of sequence fragments, some negative data could be identi—
cal to positive data in this work, potentially causing false positive or
false negative predictions. Therefore, CD—HIT was applied again, by
running CD-HIT-2D across positive and negative training data with
100% sequence identity. Table 1 shows the data statistics after elim—
inating the homologous fragments using CD—HIT based on various
values of sequence identity (ranging from 100 to 40%). After having
filtered out homologous fragments with 40% sequence identity (by
running CD-HIT and psi-CD-HIT), the final dataset comprisesd
1247 positive sequences and 9446 negative sequences.

Based on binary classification, the positive and negative datasets
was used to generate the predictive model. The 5—fold cross—valid—
ation was then applied to evaluate the power of distinguishing be—
tween the S—sulfenylated and non—S—sulfenylated cysteines. However,
the predictive performance might be overestimated due to an overfit—
ting of training dataset. To assess the real case for the predictive per—
formance of the proposed models, an independent testing set,
definitely blind to the training set, was generated. The dataset for in—
dependent testing was generated by randomly selecting from the

and the remaining data were used as the training dataset. The train—
ing dataset contained 1031 positive and 8028 negative sequence
fragments. The final independent testing dataset contained 216 posi—
tive and 1418 negative data (Table 1).

2.2 Feature investigation and encoding

To build the predictive models, SVM was adopted to discriminate
between S—sulfenylation and non—S—sulfenylation sites based on se—
quence—based features such as 20D binary coding (AA), AAC,
BLOSUM62, ASA, AAPC, PSSM and PWM. The fragment se—
quences, which contained the S—sulfenylated cysteine in the center,
were extracted with window size equal to 21 from positive and
negative data (Lee et al., 2011a,b,c). Orthogonal binary coding is
one of the most popular coding methods of converting amino acids
into numeric vectors, called 20D binary code. For instance, Alanine
(A) was encoded as ‘10000000000000000000’, and Cysteine (C)
was encoded as ‘01000000000000000000’. The number of feature
vectors was (2n—l—1)><20 to represent the flanking amino acids
surrounding the S—sulfenylation sites. The training data contained
[a vectors {x,-, i: 1, 2..., 13} corresponding to the [a fragment se—
quences. To classify the positive and negative cysteine, a label was
applied for each vector to mark the class of its corresponding pro—
tein. For composition of amino acid around the S—sulfenylation sites,
the vector x,- had 21 elements for AAC and 441 elements for AAPC.

7

Some rare amino acids and non—existing ‘— residues were used to
represent <21-mer fragment sequences at an N— or C—terminus. The
BLOSUM62 was built on the alignments of amino acid sequences
with no >62% identity between two peptide sequences with 21
amino acids. Using the SulfoSite method (Chang et al., 2009), PWM
was determined with non—homologous training data. The PWM
described the frequent occurrence of amino acids surrounding the
S—sulfenylation sites, and was utilized in encoding the fragment
sequences. Each residue of a training dataset was represented by a
matrix of m x w elements, where w is the window size equal to 21,
and m represents 21 elements including 20 types of amino acids and
one for the terminal signal.

PSSM profiles were generated from PSI—BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997) against non—redundant sequences of S—sulfenylation sites. This
matrix of score values can represent the multiple sequence alignment
of proteins which may have similar structures with different AACs.
Extracting from the PSSM profile, the matrix of (211 —l— 1) x 20 elem-
ents had rows centered on the substrate site, where 211 —l— 1 represents
the window size, and 20 is the number of position—specific scores for
each type of amino acid.

The structural feature of ASA was investigated based on the ac—
cessibility of a side—chain of amino acid on the surface of a protein

that experienced post—translational modification (Pang et al., 2007).
RVP—Net (Ahmad et al., 2003a,b), an effective tool, was adopted to
calculate the ASA value from the protein sequence due to the lack of
most experimental S—sulfenylated protein tertiary structures in
Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Berman et al., 2000). RVP—Net can pre—
dict the real ASA of a residue based on information about the neigh—
borhood by using a neural network. The possible mean absolute
error, given by the absolute difference between the predicted and ex—
perimental values of relative ASA per residue, was 18.0—19.5%, for
each measurement (Ahmad et al., 2003a,b). The value of ASA was
the percentage of the solvent—accessible area of each amino acid on
the protein. The input data of the RVP—Net were the full—length pro—
tein sequences to compute the ASA value of all of the residues. The
ASA values of amino acids around the S—sulfenylation sites were
then extracted and normalized to the range 0—1.

Each hybrid feature was formed by combining two or more sin—
gle features. Based on the performance of each feature, the single
feature with the best performance was incorporated with other sin—
gle features to enhance predictive power. Supplementary Figure S1
describes the conceptual flowchart for combining the PSSM and
BLOSUM62 features for each sequence fragment. Before the con—
struction of SVM classifier, all the numeric data need to be scaled
into values ranging from —1 to +1 to improve prediction
effectiveness.

2.3 Model construction and evaluation

The positive and negative training data sets for the predictive model
were built using SVM. Based on binary classification, a kernel func-
tion transforms the input samples into a higher dimensional space,
and then finds a hyper—plane to discriminate between the two classes
with maximal margin and minimal error. This study employed a
public SVM library (LIBSVM) (Chang and Lin, 2011) to implement
the predictive model for distinguishing the S—sulfenylation sites from
non—S—sulfenylation sites. The radial basis function (RBF):

1451751) = €XP(—V||Si — 5ij <1)

was adopted as the kernel function for learning in the SVM classi-
fier. Two supporting factors to enhance the performance are gamma
and cost. The RBF kernel is determined by the gamma parameter,
while the cost parameter controls the hyper—plane softness. Each fea—
ture was used to generate a predictive model by LIBSVM library;
then, the best feature was selected as an input vector for the second—
layered SVM based on the values of previous estimated probability
from each SVM classifier.

To choose the best final model, the 5—fold cross—validation was
carried out for each different feature to evaluate the predictive per—
formances. The training data were divided into five approximately
equal—sized subgroups. The ratio of test and training sets was 1:4,
and the cross—validation process was run five times. The five valid—
ation results were then combined to generate a single estimation.
Cross—validation evaluation improves the reliability of evaluation,
because it considers all original data, in both the training and
testing data sets, in general, and tests each subset only once
(Lu et al., 2011). To gauge the effectively predictive performance of
training model, the following measures were used: sensitivity (Sn),
specificity (Sp), accuracy (Acc) and Matthews Correlation
Coefficient (MCC):

where TP, TN, FP and FN represent the numbers of true positives,
true negatives, false positives and false negatives, respectively.
Sensitivity is the percentage of correct predictions from positive data
(S—sulfenylated cysteines), while specificity represents that from
negative data (non—S—sulfenylated cysteines). Accuracy reﬂects the
overall proportion of correctly predicted positive data (S—sulfeny—
lated cysteines) and negative data (non—S—sulfenylated cysteines). For
binary classifications, accuracy is sometimes not useful when the
two classes are of very different sizes. Therefore, the MCC is typic—
ally considered as a balanced measure, even if the two classes are of
very different sizes (Matthews, 1975). The MCC value is ranging
from —1 to +1, while the values of other three measures range from
0 to 1. A coefficient value of +1 represents a perfect prediction,
while the values 0 and —1 represent random and opposite predic—
tions, respectively. A higher positive MCC value indicates a better
prediction for correctly classifying positive and negative data.
Finally, after selecting the best predictive model with the highest
MCC in this work, an independent test was carried out on the final
model with best performance in cross—validation evaluation.

2.3 Data grouping by MDD

This work investigated the substrate motifs of S—sulfenylation sites
based on the amino acid sequences. MDD (Burge and Karlin, 1997)
was utilized to cluster all fragment sequences into subgroups to de—
tect the statistically conserved motifs from large—scale sequence
data. The clustering was performed using a public MDD clustering
resource, MDDLogo (Lee et al., 2011a,b,c), which splits a larger
group into smaller subgroups with significantly conserved motifs be—
fore computationally identifying PTM sites (Bretana et al., 2012;
Chen et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2005a,b; Lee et al., 2011a,b,c,
2012; Wong et al., 2007). The dependence of amino acid occurrence
between two positions, A, and A], that surround the S—sulfenylated
cysteine, was evaluated using chi—square test 12(A1,Aj). Based on the
biochemical property of amino acids, the 20 amino acids were cate—
gorized into five groups, namely polar, acidic, basic, hydrophobic
and aromatic groups (Supplementary Table S2). A contingency table
in Supplementary Figure S2A describes the frequency of existence of
amino acids between two positions A, and Aj. The chi—square test
was defined as:

5 5 an — EInn 2
121141.141) = Zm=12,21(.E—) (6)

where an represented the number of sequences at both the position
A, of the group In and position A]- of group n, for each pair (A, , A1)
with i 75 j. Emn was calculated as %, where XmR:
Xm1+ . . . +Xm5, XCn2X1n+ . . . +X5n, and X denoted the total
number of sequences. If a strong dependence (defined as 12 > 34.3,
corresponding to a cutoff level of P-value : 0.01 with 16 degrees of
freedom) was detected between two positions, then the decompos—
ition was proceeded (Burge and Karlin, 1997). As shown in
Supplemtary Figure S2B, the group of basic amino acids kept the
maximal dependent value at position —2. Consequently, all data can
be separated into two subgroups: one with basic amino acids in

position —2, and the other with no basic amino acids in position
—2. The maximum cluster size is an important parameter when
applying MDDLogo to cluster the sequences of the positive set. The
recursive process of MDD clustering was performed to divide the
positive sets into tree—like subgroups repeatedly until all subgroups
are smaller than the maximum cluster size. To obtain an optimal
minimum cluster size, MDDLogo was run using various values for
that parameter. For this investigation, each subgroup generated by
MDDLogo was represented using WebLogo (Crooks et al., 2004) to
determine whether they presented conserved motifs for the substrate
specificity of S—sulfenylation.

These MDDLogo—identified substrate motifs could be adopted to
create a two—layered SVM prediction model for the identification of
SOH sites with their corresponding substrate motifs. As illustrated
in Figure 1, the LIBSVM library was employed at the first layer of
SVM to generate a predictive model based on the investigation re—
sults of the best features. The LIBSVM library outputs a probability
value estimate ranging from 0 to 1 for each prediction. Therefore,
the probability values estimated from each SVM classifier trained
according to a specific motif were adopted to form an input vector
for the second layer of SVM.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Impact of flanking AAC to S—sulfenylation sites

This investigation analyzed the frequency of occurrence of 20 amino
acids surrounding the S—sulfenylation site on fragment sequences of
proteins to find the potential consensus motifs. TwoSampleLogo
(Vacic et al., 2006) is an effective web—based tool to detect statistic—
ally noteworthy differences in position—specific symbol compositions
between the S—sulfenylated and non—S—sulfenylated data sets. The
Cysteine amino acid was placed in the middle of the fragment se—
quences, and positions of the ﬂanking amino acids were described in
range from —10 to +10. The comparison between 1031 S—sulfenyla—
tion sites and 8028 non—S—sulfenylation sites in Figure 2 demon-
strates that the positively charged amino acids, such as Lysine (K)
and Arginine (R), had the highest ratios at positions —10, —7, —6,
—4, —2, and [+4, +8] (with P < 0.01). Additionally, no positively
charged residues were found at positions —9, —3, —1, +1, +2, +3
close to the S—sulfenylation sites. Furthermore, negatively charged
residues (Glutamic acid — E) were found at positions —4, —3, +1,
+3, +4. Position —1 was a special case with the highest proportion
of the polar group of residues, namely Serine (S) and Asparagine
(N). In contrast, the non—S—sulfenylation database contained many
instances of neutral amino acids Leucine (L), Cysteine (C), Histidine
(H), Methionine (M), Phenylalanine (F) and Tyrosine (Y) at pos—
itions in range [—9, +7], while only Arginine (R) reside appeared at
three positions (—1, +1 and +2) near the non—S—sulfenylation sites.
This investigation found a significant difference in the amino acid
sequences located around position —6, —2, —1, +3 and +4 in the
two sets. The analysis shows that the distance among amino acid
characteristic in a sequence plays a vital role in distinguishing be-
tween S—sulfenylation sites and non—S—sulfenylation sites. Finally,
positively charged amino acids may be contiguous to S—sulfenylated
cysteine in a 3D structure.

The significant amino acids around S—sulfenylated cysteine resi—
due is enriched from the positive dataset and presented in upper
panel (P<0.01). Relatively, the high frequency of amino acids
around non—S—sulfenylated cysteines is depleted from the negative
dataset and presented in lower panel.

To estimate carefully the composition of amino acids in se—
quences, the correlation between S—sulfenylation sites and the

around S—sulfenylation sites compared with the non-S—sulfenylation sites

solvent ASA was evaluated using the RVP—Net algorithm. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S3, the average percentage of ASA of
cysteine residue was the lowest on both the S—sulfenylated and
non—S—sulfenylated cysteines based on the comparison of average
proportion of ASA in the 21-mer window ([—10, +10]). This finding
indicates that solvent accessibility at S—sulfenylated sites is usually
lower than that of ﬂanking regions. Additionally, the neighboring
amino acids surrounding the S—sulfenylation sites reacted to the
solvent-ASA higher than non—S—sulfenylation sites. Following inves—
tigations of AAC (Fig. 2) and solvent accessibility (Supplementary
Fig. S3), the important influence of hydrophilic amino acid group
may regulate the S—sulfenylated cysteine residues.

3.2 Performance of 5—fold cross—validation on training data
To identify the best feature for discriminating between S—
sulfenylation sites and non—S—sulfenylation sites, the SVM models

were trained using various features, namely AA, AAC, AAPC,
BLOSUM62, ASA, PSSM and PWM. As shown in Table 2, the SVM
model trained with ASA had the lowest MCC value at 0.14, and
relatively low sensitivity, specificity and accuracy at 0.61, 0.61 and
0.61, respectively. In contrast, PSSM was found to be the best fea—
ture for generating an SVM model, with sensitivity at 0.68, specifi—
city at 0.68, accuracy at 0.68, and MCC at 0.24. The features
BLOSUM62, AA and AAPC were found to be combined well with
PSSM to improve predictive power. For others cases in this table,
the results of AAC and PWM provided quite similar performance.
The predictive model based on the hybrid combination of
BLOSUM62 with PSSM provided the best predictive performance in
Sn, Sp, Acc and MCC at 0.68, 0.70, 0.70 and 0.27, respectively.
This hybrid feature had a slightly higher sensitivity than PSSM.
Therefore, the hybrid feature of PSSM with BLOSUM62 was se—
lected as the training feature for the construction of two—layered
SVM model.

3.3 MDDLogo—identified substrate motifs

In this investigation, the MDD was adopted to detect the conserved
motifs by clustering S—sulfenylation data set (1031 sequences) into
10 subgroups. Each subgroup represents an S—sulfenylated motif
that contains statistically significant dependencies of AAC between
specific positions (Table 3). Overall, eight motifs out of all
MDDLogo—clustered subgroups were detected based on the posi—
tively charged amino acids (K, R and H) and negatively charged
amino acids (D, E). Subgroups SOH1, SOH2, SOH3 and SOH4
represented the occurrence of positively charged amino acids

whereas the other subgroups had no occurrence of positively
charged amino acids in position —2. In particular, one special motif
was discovered with a significant percentage of amino acid belong-
ing to the polar group (over 27%). Finally, the tenth subgroup

(SOH10), containing the remaining 279 S—sulfenylation sites, had a

little conservation of amino acids at position —1.

To improve the reliability of our study, the 5—fold cross—

validation evaluation was adopted on all of the S—sulfenylation sites
and on the 10 MDDLogo—clustered subgroups. Table 3 displays the

predictive results of 5 —fold cross—validation in each group. As noted
earlier, position —2 of the first four groups hid behind the significant
inﬂuence leading to their performance >0.87. Among these four
groups, SOH1 and SOH3 were found to have the best sensitivity,
specificity, accuracy and MCC, with respective values of 0.93, 0.94,
0.94 and 0.76 for SOH1, and 0.92, 0.92, 0.92 and 0.72 for SOH3.
The SVM—based predictive performance of these 10 MDDLogo—
clustered subgroups was higher than that of all 1031 unclustered
S—sulfenylation sites. The SVM model constructed at the second
SVM layer, combining MDDLogo—identified motifs, had sensitivity,
specificity, accuracy and MCC values of 0.85, 0.87, 0.87 and 0.5 8,
respectively, which were all much higher than those of the unclus—
tered 1,031 S—sulfenylation sites at 0.68, 0.69, 0.69 and 0.25, re—
spectively. In summary, the combined MDDLogo—clustered models
might be expected to enhance the performance, and could be imple—
mented a web—based prediction tool in a website.

3.4 Evaluation of S—sulfenylation predictive models
using independent testing set

An independent testing set of S—sulfenylated proteins was used to
evaluate the effectiveness of the MDDLogo—clustered SVM models
that achieved the best accuracy in 5—fold cross—validation. The inde—
pendent testing set comprised 216 positive data and 1418 negative
data. Figure 3 presents the test results, indicating significant differ-
ences in the ratio of sensitivity, specificity, accuracy and MCC be—
tween the two models at 0.71, 0.71, 0.71, 0.30 respectively for
Single SVM, and 0.86, 0.92, 0.91, 0.68 respectively for Two—layered
SVM. Supplementary Table S3 lists the detailed independent testing
results, in which the MDDLogo—clustered SVM models had better
predictive performance than the Single SVM model.

3.51mplementation of web—based prediction tool

Researchers have applied various methods to work with S—
sulfenylated proteins in the laboratory (Furdui and Poole, 2014;
Yang et al., 2014), but often encounter difficulties such as expensive
equipment, time—consuming processing and complex laboratory—
intensive experimental workflows. Therefore, this work developed
an effective prediction tool to overcome the challenges in identifying
the S—sulfenylation sites. Based on the evaluated results of cross—
validation and independent test, the MDDLogo—clustered SVM
model trained using PSSM and BLOSUM62 was implemented to
develop the web—based prediction system, named MDD—SOH. The
system enables users to submit the protein sequences of interest and
return predictive results including S—sulfenylation position, the

ﬂanking amino acids and the matched MDDLogo—clustered motif.
The input data for MDD—SOH can be the protein sequence in
FASTA format or the protein name, gene name and accession
number.

The effectiveness of MDD—SOH was tested using following three
cases: ‘Fatty acid—binding protein, epidermal’ (FABP5,
FABP5_HUMAN), Peroxiredoxin (PRDX6, PRDX6_HUMAN) and
peroxiredoxin HYR1 (HYR1, GPX3_YEAST). The first case is
Fatty acid—binding protein, epidermal (FABP5, FABP5_HUMAN),
which contains one S—sulfenylation site at Cys—127 (Yang et al.,
2014). As presented in Supplementary Figure S4, MDD—SOH was
predicted exactly at position 127 of the S—sulfenylation protein.
Moreover, the system also displayed the matched MDDLogo—clus—
tered motif. The second test was carried out on Peroxiredoxin pro-
tein on human (PRDX6, PRDX6_HUMAN), which contains one S—
sulfenylation site at Cys—91 (Yang et al., 2014), and which was not
in the training data set. Consequently, the position 91 of the experi—
mentally-verified S—sulfenylation site was also correctly predicted by
MDD-SOH. Finally, peroxiredoxin HYR1 (HYR1, GPX3_YEAST)
has Cysteine in position 36 (Seo and Carroll, 2011), which was also
correctly predicted.

3.6 Functional investigation of S—sulfenylated proteins
To further understand the characteristics and function of proteins,
Database for Annotation, Visualization and Integrated Discovery
(DAVID) software provides a comprehensive set of functional anno—
tation tools for investigators to exploit biological meaning behind
large list of genes (http://david.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/home.jsp).
According to the GO annotations, the distributions of the biological
processes, molecular functions and cellular components of S—sulfeny-
lated proteins were presented in Supplementary Table S4. Following
the analytic results, 113 of 1096 S—sulfenylation proteins involve in
RNA processing with 10.8% corresponding P—value (7.65E—32).
Additionally, there are many proteins took part in RNA binding, nu-
cleotide binding, ribonucleotide binding, purine ribonucleotide
binding and purine nucleotide binding with 148 (14.15%), 273
(26.10%), 217 (20.75%), 217 (20.75%) and 223 (21.32%), respect-
ively. Furthermore, S—sulfenylation proteins also played an import—
ant role in construction of cellular component such as nuclear lumen
(21.03%), non—membrane—bounded organelle (29.73%), intracellu—
lar non-membrane—bounded organelle (29.73%), etc.

Supplementary Table S5 describes the distribution of KEGG
pathways for S—sulfenylated proteins. Comparing with the GO en—
richment analysis, few of these proteins were involved in the meta—
bolic pathways. The statistics show that only 27 of 1096 proteins
(2.5 8%) formed a pathway for the pathogenic Escherichia coli infec—
tion. Finally, the investigation of protein domains shows that the
most abundant domain in S—sulfenylated proteins is the
Thioredoxin-like fold with 1.74% (7.47 X 10T6), as shown in
Supplementary Table S6.

4 Conclusion

This study identified the S—sulfenylation sites of proteins, and inves—
tigated the statistically significant conserved motifs. Through
TwoSampleLogo, the analysis of position—specific amino acids
composition between S—sulfenylation and non—S—sulfenylation site
identified the relationship between ﬂanking amino acids with the
S—sulfenylation cysteine site. Moreover, this investigation also
found that the solvent—accessible surface of amino acid surrounding
S—sulfenylation sites have a tendency to higher than that around

non—S—sulfenylation sites. Based on the results of 5—fold cross—valid—
ation, the hybrid feature of BLOSUM62 and PSSM was estimated as
the best feature with the highest proportion of sensitivity, specificity,
accuracy and MCC. As stated previously, the main purpose is to
find the conserved motifs of S—sulfenylation sites based on the amino
acid sequences. By using MDDLogo, all S—sulfenylation proteins
were clustered into 10 subgroups corresponding with 10 conserved
motifs. The MDD—identified motif can thus be adopted to train the
model to enhance significantly the predictive performance of the S—
sulfenylation site. The sets were evaluated through independent test—
ing using two models, namely MDDLogo—clustered SVM and Single
SVM without MDD. As expected, MDDLogo—clustered SVM
model, which contained the significant conserved motifs, achieved
the better performance. Consequently, this model was employed
to set up a novel web—based resource, named MDD—SOH, to identify
S—sulfenylation sites and their corresponding substrate motifs.

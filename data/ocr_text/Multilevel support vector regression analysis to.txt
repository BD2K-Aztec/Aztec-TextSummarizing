ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of gene regulatory modules is an
important yet challenging problem in computational biology. While
many computational methods have been proposed to identify
regulatory modules, their initial success is largely compromised by a
high rate of false positives, especially when applied to human cancer
studies. New strategies are needed for reliable regulatory module
identification.

Results: We present a new approach, namely multilevel support
vector regression (ml-SVR), to systematically identify condition-
specific regulatory modules. The approach is built upon a multilevel
analysis strategy designed for suppressing false positive predictions.
With this strategy, a regulatory module becomes ever more
significant as more relevant gene sets are formed at finer levels.
At each level, a two-stage support vector regression (SVR) method
is utilized to help reduce false positive predictions by integrating
binding motif information and gene expression data; a significant
analysis procedure is followed to assess the significance of each
regulatory module. To evaluate the effectiveness of the proposed
strategy, we first compared the ml-SVR approach with other existing
methods on simulation data and yeast cell cycle data. The resulting
performance shows that the ml-SVR approach outperforms other
methods in the identification of both regulators and their target
genes. We then applied our method to breast cancer cell line data
to identify condition-specific regulatory modules associated with
estrogen treatment. Experimental results show that our method
can identify biologically meaningful regulatory modules related to
estrogen signaling and action in breast cancer.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying regulatory modules is one of the key steps to
understanding the molecular mechanisms of biological processes,

especially important for deﬁning the deregulated pathways in cancer.
At the transcriptional level, a regulatory module is deﬁned as a set
of genes controlled by one or several transcription factors (TFs)
in a condition—speciﬁc manner (Segal et al., 2003). TFs can either
activate or inhibit gene expression, usually by binding to short,
highly conserved, DNA sequences in the promoter (or upstream)
region, i.e. transcription factor binding site (TFB S) or binding motif.
In higher eukaryotes, TFBSs are often organized in clusters called
cis—regulatory modules (CRMs). Many computational methods have
been developed to facilitate the identiﬁcation of CRMs from either
gene expression data or DNA sequence data. Expression—based
methods (lhmels et al., 2004; Segal et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2005)
take advantage of gene expression data but lack of sequence binding
constraints. Sequence—based module discovery algorithms, such as
CisModule (Zhou and Wong, 2004), CREME (Sharan et al., 2003)
and ModuleSearch (Aerts et al., 2003), analyze the promoter regions
of a set of coregulated genes to identify overrepresented motif
combinations. A major limitation of sequence—based methods is
that they do not consider the condition—speciﬁc nature of regulatory
modules, i.e. they ignore the relationship between binding afﬁnities
and gene expression levels.

A living cell is a dynamic system in which gene activities
and interactions exhibit temporal patterns and spatial
compartmentalization (Qi and Ge, 2006). Recently, several
studies have shown that binding of TFs not only depends on their
afﬁnity for the binding sites but binding also occurs in a condition—
speciﬁc manner in response to various environmental changes (Lee
et al., 2002; Segal et al., 2008). Thus, a TF may play different
regulatory roles to its downstream target genes or may even have
different downstream targets under different conditions (Lee et al.,
2002). Motivated by this understanding, many computational
algorithms were proposed to discover condition—speciﬁc regulatory
modules by integrating condition—speciﬁc gene expression proﬁles
and motif information. Regression models are widely used to
combine these two types of information (Das et al., 2006; Gao
et al., 2004; Nguyen and D’Haeseleer, 2006; Ruan and Zhang,
2006; Yu and Li, 2005). For example, a least square regression (LS
regression) method described by (Nguyen and D’Haeseleer, 2006)
identiﬁes signiﬁcant regulators by combining mRNA expression
level and ChIP—on—chip binding data to minimize a ﬁtting error.
GRAM (Bar—Joseph et al., 2003) is another regression method
based on an iterative search to identify signiﬁcant regulators and

target genes. Bayesian models have also been used for regulatory
module identiﬁcation. A thermodynamic model (Segal et al.,
2008) was proposed to predict expression patterns from regulatory
sequence data in Drosophila segmentation. COGRIM (Chen et al.,
2007) is a Bayesian hierarchical model with Gibbs Sampling
implementation that integrates gene expression data, ChIP binding
data and TF motif information to identify regulatory modules.

While these methods have achieved some degree of success, a
high false positive prediction rate is still a major problem mainly
due to the noises in motif information and gene expression data.
To reduce the false positive rate (FPR), we propose a novel
method, namely multilevel regulatory module identiﬁcation through
support vector regression (ml—SVR), to help ﬁnd signiﬁcant and
stable regulatory modules. The ml—SVR method is particularly
effective because of several novel adaptations: (i) a two—stage
support vector regression (SVR) method is used to integrate binding
motif information and gene expression data, aiming to improve the
noise—tolerance capability; (ii) a signiﬁcance analysis procedure is
applied to identify statistically signiﬁcant regulatory modules; (iii) a
multilevel analysis strategy is developed to reduce the FPR for
reliable regulatory module identiﬁcation; and (iv) a weighted voting
scheme is implemented for target gene identiﬁcation, taking into
account the entire multilevel analysis.

We have applied the ml—SVR method to simulation data and
yeast cell cycle data to assess its performance for gene module
identiﬁcation, in comparison with existing methods. The comparison
results clearly demonstrate that the proposed ml—SVR method
notably outperforms other methods. We then applied our method to
two breast cancer microarray datasets to identify condition—speciﬁc
regulatory modules, respectively, in response to different estrogen
conditions. The experimental results show that our method can
successfully identify biologically meaningful modules associated
with estrogen signaling and action in breast cancer.

2 METHODS

The ml—SVR method is aimed to identify signiﬁcant condition—speciﬁc
regulatory modules by integrating mRNA gene expression data and binding
motif information. Figure 1 illustrates the ﬂow chart of the ml—SVR approach,
shown as an iterative procedure in a nutshell. This multilevel analysis
procedure, as conducted in a coarse—to—ﬁne way, ensures that a condition—
speciﬁc regulatory module becomes ever more signiﬁcant as more relevant
gene sets are formed at ﬁner levels. At each level, SVR is used to integrate
binding motif information and gene expression data. Speciﬁcally, a two—stage
SVR method is implemented to reﬁne the estimation of transcription factor
activity (TFA) and binding strength. Signiﬁcance analysis of regulatory
modules is achieved by evaluating the regression ﬁtting errors compared
to a baseline without motif information; an F —statistic is calculated from
a permutation test to assess the signiﬁcance (P—value) of a regulatory
module. Finally, with the multilevel analysis, signiﬁcant gene modules can
be determined and their target genes identiﬁed by a voting scheme running
through all levels. In the following subsections, we provide a detailed
description of each component in the ml—SVR approach.

2.1 Sequence analysis for motif information

ChIP—on—chip, also known as genome—wide location analysis, is a technique
that can isolate and identify DNA sequences occupied by speciﬁc DNA
binding proteins (Aparicio et al., 2004). However, it is not a trivial task to
measure the binding strengths for all TFs from ChIP—on—chip experiments due
to the limited antibodies available, especially for higher eukaryote studies.
An alternative and practical way is to extract binding motif information

from the promoter regions of focused genes. We assume that the binding
strength for a speciﬁc TF to its target gene is proportional to the similarity
score of its binding site and the number of occurrences of the binding site
in the gene promoter region. We generated a gene—motif binding strength
matrix X: [xgm] using the cut offs that minimize the FPR. The rows in
the matrix X correspond to different genes, and the columns correspond to
different binding sites (or motifs). Each element xgm represents the binding
strength at motif m in the promoter region of a gene g, which is calculated
mathematically as follows:

N
xgm = Z %(mSngi +CSngi)a (1)
i=1
where N is the number of occurrences of motif m in the promoter region of
gene g; mssgmi and cssgml- are the matrix similarity score and core similarity
score for motif m and gene g in the i—th hit, respectively (for more details,
please refer to Section $1 in the Supplementary Material).

2.2 Two-stage SVR to infer regulatory modules

Suppose that there are G genes and T gene expression proﬁles. We represent
microarray gene expression data as a matrix YGXT = [ygt], g: 1,...,G; t:
l,..., T, where each element ygt is the log ratio of the expression level of
gene g in sample t to that of the control sample. We also assume that there are
M motifs on this gene set and the corresponding gene motif binding matrix is
XGXM =[xgm], g: 1,...,G; m: l, ...,M, where xgm is the binding strength
on motif m in the promoter region of gene g. The relationship between gene
expression level and binding strength can be mathematically described by a
linear model as follows:

YGXTZXGXMAMXT‘l‘Na (2)

where AMxT= [amt], m: l, ...,M;t= 1,...,T is the TF activity matrix and
N the noise matrix. Biologically, the model represents the log ratio of gene
expression levels expressed as a linear combination of log ratios of TFAs
(denoted as am) weighted by their binding strengths (i.e. xgm) (Liao et al.,
2003).

If X and Y are known, the solution to the linear model [Equation (2)] can
then be easily obtained by a simple regression (Bussemaker et al., 2001).
However, since both motif information and gene expression data are noisy, a
simple regression will inevitably introduce a large number of false positive
predictions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a two—stage SVR method to
speciﬁcally address the noises in motif information and gene expression data.
SVR has been shown to have good robust properties against noise through
the regularization term in its cost function (Smola and Scholkopf, 1998); the
regularization term is intended to keep the estimated TF activity (in matrix A)

as smooth as possible so as to combat the noise in gene expression data (Y).
The 8—insensitive loss function is used in SVR to ensure the existence of the
global minimum and a high tolerance to noise, which is deﬁned by

‘ygt _}A’gt‘ —87

where fig, is the estimated value of expression log ratio ygt. To combat the
noise in motif information, we use a similar strategy as in the two—stage
approach proposed by Yu et al. (2005) to update the binding strength matrix
X based on Y and the estimated A. In this way, we can reduce the number
of false binding motifs, which are initially present in the binding strength
matrix X but with no support from gene expression data (Y) and estimated
TF activity (A).

The two—stage SVR method is implemented as an iterative procedure,
which updates matrices A and X alternately until converged. In the
implementation, we normalize (or standardize) the gene expression data to 0
mean and 1 standard deviation. We also standardize the estimated TF activity
at each iteration step of our algorithm. The ﬁnal algorithm of our two—stage
SVR approach can be summarized as follows:

(1) Estimate A using X and Y. For each column vector y, in matrix Y,
regress y, against X based on ygt = f (Xg)=Zg1/I:1xgmamt; calculate
regression coefﬁcient am using 8—insensitive SVR.

Update X using A and Y. For each row vector yg in matrix Y,
regress yg against A based on yg, = f (at)=Zg1/I:1x/ gmamt; calculate
regression coefﬁcient x/gm using 8—insensitive SVR; update X by
X =X+ r}(X/ —X), where r} is a parameter in the range of (0, 1). (Note
that r} is set to 0.2 in our experiments.)

(3

V

Repeat Step (1) and Step (2) until convergence. The convergence
criterion is deﬁned as the average correlation coefﬁcient of TF
activities between two successive iterations is larger than a predeﬁned
threshold r0. (Note that r0 is set as 0.9 in our experiments.)

2.3 Signiﬁcance analysis of regulatory modules

A signiﬁcance analysis procedure is designed to test if a selected motif set
is statistically associated with the regulation of a given gene set, aiming to
identify active regulators for that set. The null and alternative hypotheses
(H0 and H1, respectively) are given as follows:

H0: the motif set is not actively involved in regulating a given gene set;

H1: the motif set is actively involved in regulating a given gene set.

We use a summary statistic to represent the ﬁtting results as described
below:

Rsso—Rssl _ 2 _ 1
R881 0 g; (ygz Yr) yz lGlgEGGygt

a (4)
RSS1 = ZO’gI _5;gt)27 )A’gt = Zamtxgm +bt

g,t m

where RSSO is the residual sum of squares without motif information, and
R881 is the residual sum of squares with motif information. The above
equation is proportional to the typical F —statistic used to compare two models
(Lomax, 2007). To calculate the P—value, we use the permutation method
described below to form the null distribution. For a given motif set, we
randomly select a gene set G0 with the same size of G from the entire
gene population, and then repeat B times to generate the corresponding null
statistic score F017 , for b: l, 2, ..., B (B = 1000 in our experiments). The
P—value can be obtained for each gene set by calculating the probability
that a null gene set has a statistic more extreme than the observed statistic.
Mathematically, the P—value is calculated by the following equation:

#{b:F0b>F,b=l,...,B}
p=PrH0 (FOb >F): B . (5)

 

2.4 Multilevel analysis for regulatory module
identiﬁcation

Assuming that most genes involved in a regulatory module are coexpressed
under a given condition, we can use a clustering method to form the gene
set for regression analysis. However, simple gene clustering based on gene
expression data alone often results in many false positives for gene module
identiﬁcation. In addition, motif information is noisy and incomplete due
to the current status of limited biological knowledge. Thus, false positives
would be included based on a ﬁxed gene set and available motif information.
To reduce the false positives, we developed a multilevel analysis strategy
to search for regulatory modules showing signiﬁcance consistently from
coarse level to ﬁne levels. With this strategy, a condition—speciﬁc regulatory
module and its enriched motifs will appear increasingly signiﬁcant in ﬁner
levels, as the irrelevant genes are gradually eliminated (see Supplementary
Fig. $1 in the Supplementary Material for an illustration of the multilevel
strategy). Technically, a multilevel gene clustering procedure, such as self—
organizing map clustering (Kohonen, 1997), is used to form the gene
clusters to gradually reduce the irrelevant genes for multilevel analysis.
The multilevel analysis strategy, incorporating the two—stage SVR approach
described previously, is the backbone of the ml—SVR approach proposed in
this article for reliable regulatory module identiﬁcation. The ﬁnal ml—SVR
procedure is illustrated in Figure l, which can also be summarized as follows:

(1) Set cluster number 021 and cluster level 1:1. For all possible
enriched motif sets, calculate their P—values on current gene set
G through the two—stage SVR analysis and signiﬁcance analysis
described in Subsections 2.2 and 2.3.

(2) Increment 0 by l and l by l. Cluster the gene population into 0 clusters,
denoted as {Gl,G§,...,Gg}.
(3) For each gene cluster, calculate P—values for all possible enriched

motifs by the two—stage SVR analysis and signiﬁcance analysis
(Subsections 2.2 and 2.3).

(4) Repeat Steps (2) and (3) until the stopping criterion is met, that is, the
number of genes is less than a threshold to for all gene clusters.

(5) Use p551 to denote the P—value of a candidate motif set Mfor cluster
Géat level 1. Output the signiﬁcantly enriched motif sets if they satisfy
min < pf) , V], where p6 is the threshold of P—value at level I. The

C
total number of levels is L. Assign the ﬁnal weighted average P—value
as W =Zl/Amin(plg). A=1+2+---+L.
l

(6) Use a voting scheme to determine the gene members of a regulatory
module with the enriched motif set M: ﬁrst initialize a gene weight
vector W as 0 and then update W by the following equation:

_ ' [C l
VLC,   + Z   <p0.
mEM

(7

V

Finally, the genes whose weights are greater than a threshold wo are
chosen as the members of a corresponding regulatory module. In
our implementation, we set wo as the mean of W plus one standard
deviation, which gives us a reasonable number of target genes for
further study (see the Supplementary Material, Section S7, for a
discussion on the choice of threshold wo).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Simulation data

We ﬁrst tested our method on a synthetic yeast microarray dataset.
The microarray dataset was simulated using the network generator
software SynTReN (Van den Bulcke et al., 2006), where network
topologies are generated from yeast regulatory networks using a
neighbor addition strategy. The network consists of 29 TFs and
260 target genes. The mRNA expression proﬁles were generated

for 260 genes at 50 different conditions based on the network.
In our algorithm, we used a ChIP—on—chip data (Lee et al., 2002)
as our binding information data that includes 113 regulators and
their binding P—values to all genes. The purpose of this study is
to ﬁrst identify true regulators and then their downstream target
genes. To fulﬁll this purpose, we applied the ml—SVR approach to
the simulation data and identiﬁed signiﬁcant regulatory networks
associated with TFs. The detailed experimental procedure as well as
the parameter settings of ml—SVR can be found in the Supplementary
Material (Section S2).

To evaluate our proposed ml—SVR approach, we compared its
performance with similar methods including LS regression (Nguyen
and D’Haeseleer, 2006), LASSO (Tibshirani, 1996), GRAM (Bar—
Joseph et al., 2003) and COGRIM (Chen et al., 2007). Among these
three existing methods, only GRAM can simultaneously identify
signiﬁcant regulators and target genes. LS regression and LASSO
can only identify signiﬁcant regulators with known target genes by
assuming the binding information is known from ChIP—on—chip data.
COGRIM is derived from a Bayesian hierarchical model, which
assumes the TFs and their activities are known so as to infer new
target genes based on binding information. As a common practice
(Segal et al., 2003) but faulty (Liao et al., 2003), mRNA expression
level of each TF is often used to approximate the TF activity for
COGRIM. Therefore, in this study we compared ml—SVR with
GRAM and LS regression for TF identiﬁcation, while we compared
ml—SVR with GRAM and COGRIM for target gene identiﬁcation.

Figure 2a shows the receiver operator characteristic (ROC) curves
of TF identiﬁcation for ml—SVR, GRAM, LS regression and LASSO,
respectively. From the ﬁgure, we can see that ml—SVR outperforms
GRAM and LS regression methods in identifying signiﬁcant TFs.
The mean area under the ROC curve (AUC) value of ml—SVR
is 0.6912 (with a standard deviation of 0.0196), which is greater
than the AUC values of GRAM (0.6245), LS regression (0.5530)
and LASSO (0.5620). It should be noted that in this comparison
experiment, the overall performances of all three methods are
relatively low; this is indeed a relatively difﬁcult case since some
non—linear relationships between TFs and target genes were included
by SynTReN in the simulation data. Nevertheless, the FPR is much
reduced by ml—SVR as compared to GRAM and LS regression.
When the true positive rate (TPR) is ﬁxed at 80%, the FPR for ml—
SVR is 55.48% while 74.64% for GRAM, 94.05% for LS regression
and 71.42% for LASSO, showing a substantial improvement in FPR
reduction.

For the 29 known TFs, we compared the performance of target
gene identiﬁcation for ml—SVR, GRAM and COGRIM. Figure 2b

shows the average of ROC curves of target gene identiﬁcation for
all TFs using ml—SVR, COGRIM and GRAM, respectively. The ml—
SVR approach gave us the best performance with a mean AUC value
of 0.7358 (and a standard deviation of 0.0090). The performances of
COGRIM and GRAM are similar with the AUC values of 0.6434 and
0.6438, respectively, which are much lower than that of ml—SVR.
Also seen from Figure 2b, the FPR for ml—SVR is 42.12% given
TPR = 80%, which shows a reduction of ~25% when compared to
68.79% for GRAM and 66.04% for COGRIM. This comparison
result demonstrates the advantage of ml—SVR over other methods
for identifying signiﬁcant TFs and their target genes. For more ROC
analysis results, please refer to Figure S3 in the Supplementary
Material to see the detailed performance of target gene identiﬁcation
for several individual TFs.

3.2 Yeast cell cycle data

We also applied the ml—SVR method to a yeast cell cycle microarray
dataset (Spellman et al., 1998). This microarray dataset includes 77
samples collected with three different synchronization experimental
conditions. For the binding information, we used the ChIP—on—chip
data from Lee et al. (2002), which provides signiﬁcance levels
(P—values) of 113 TFs binding to their target genes. Among the
113 TFs, 19 regulators have been identiﬁed as cell cycle—related TFs.
We preprocessed the dataset and ﬁnally obtained 6099 open reading
frames (ORFs) that have both expression measurements and binding
information (see Section S3 in the Supplementary Material for more
details). The goal of this study is to identify the cell cycle—related
condition—speciﬁc TFs and their target genes.

To demonstrate the feasibility of applying ml—SVR to real
microarray data, we compared the performances of ml—SVR, GRAM
and LS regression for TF identiﬁcation using 19 known cell cycle—
related regulators as the ground truth. The parameters in our
algorithm are same as those in the simulation study. Figure S4 in the
Supplementary Material shows the ROC curves of TF identiﬁcation
by ml—SVR, GRAM, LS regression and LASSO. The mean AUC
value for ml—SVR is 0.9284 (with a standard deviation of 0.0127).
The AUC values for GRAM, LS regression and LASSO methods
are 0.6691, 0.8761 and 0.7704, respectively. The improvement of
ml—SVR over GRAM is substantial in terms of FPR reduction.
Again, when the TPR is ﬁxed at 80%, the FPR for ml—SVR is
11.31% while it is 74.06% for GRAM, 18.68% for LS regression
and 52.18% for LASSO, showing a substantial improvement in FPR
reduction. These results clearly show that ml—SVR outperforms the
GRAM and LS regression methods for the identiﬁcation of cell
cycle—related TFs.

For target gene identiﬁcation of all cell cycle—related TFs, since the
ground truth target genes are not known for all TFs, we assessed their
Gene Ontology (GO) functional enrichment as an alternative using
software BiNGO (Maere et al., 2005). The G0 function enrichment
score is deﬁned as the negative logarithm of Benjamin—corrected
P—value from an overrepresentative analysis in BiNGO. The average
GO functional enrichment scores are 3.53 for ml—SVR, 3.41 for
COGRIM and 2.86 for GRAM, which indicates that our method can
identify more functionally coherent gene clusters associated with
speciﬁc TFs.

condition—speciﬁc regulatory modules associated with estrogen
signaling in breast cancer. Estrogen plays a signiﬁcant role in breast
cancer development and progression. The original proﬁling study
was designed to examine how estrogen—induced gene expression
patterns observed in vitro correlate with the expression patterns in
breast tumors in vivo. Three estrogen—dependent breast cancer cell
lines (MCF—7, T47D and BT—474) were treated with 17,8—estradiol
(E2) from 0 to 24 h, and then proﬁled for gene expression using
Affymetrix GeneChip Arrays. As reported in the paper (Creighton
et al., 2006), eight E2—induced gene clusters were formed and among
them, the expression pattern in four clusters [i.e. Cluster A, B,
C and D as denoted in Creighton et al. (2006)] clearly showed
upregulation along the time from early to late, which provides us an
important starting point to study regulatory mechanisms related to
estrogen signaling and action in breast cancer. The ml—SVR approach
was applied to identify signiﬁcant regulatory networks (see Section
S4 in the Supplementary Material for the detailed experimental
procedure).

The identiﬁed signiﬁcant motifs in each cluster are shown in
Table S1 (see the Supplementary Material), along with their average
P—values across all levels, number of probe sets in the module and
the description of the corresponding TFs. The signiﬁcant motifs are
deﬁned by average P—values £0.05. Figure S5 in the Supplementary
Material shows an example of using the multilevel strategy to
determine that SP1 and AP1 are signiﬁcant TFs while ATF3 and E2F
are not signiﬁcant. Among all listed motifs and their corresponding
TFs, we found that several TFs are tightly related to estrogen
signaling as reported in previous studies (Bjornstrom and Sjoberg,
2005), to name just a few here, AP—l, SP—l and CREB. From the
table, we can also see that the signiﬁcantly enriched motifs are
different in each cluster, reﬂecting the condition—speciﬁc nature of
transcriptional regulation. Since the target genes in Clusters A and
B are upregulated within 4 h, we assigned the signiﬁcantly enriched
motifs in these two clusters to the early upregulation condition. The
target genes in Clusters C and D showed sustained induction by E2 at
8 h and 12—24 h, respectively. We assigned the signiﬁcantly enriched
motifs in Clusters C and D to the late upregulation condition.

Figure 3 shows the signiﬁcantly enriched motifs in two different
conditions, i.e. early and late conditions. We can see that AP—l, SP—l,
MYCMAX and CREB are signiﬁcantly enriched in both early and
late conditions, suggesting their important roles in estrogen signaling
and action. AP—l and SP—l are known to form TF complexes
with estrogen receptor (ER) to regulate genes with the appropriate
binding site(s); the TF CREB is phosphorylated after the MAPK
signaling pathway has been activated by 17,8—estradiol and the
phophorylation of CREB leads to the expression of genes that

contain CRE binding motifs (Bjornstrom and Sj oberg, 2005). EGR,
TCF11, E2F, KROX and LEFl are only signiﬁcantly enriched in
the early upregulation condition. Since many of their transcriptional
functions are not known, we annotated their target genes biological
function through GO analysis; their signiﬁcant GO terms are related
to ‘ribosome biogenesis’, ‘RNA metabolism’ and ‘protein folding’
(P—value <0.01). This may suggest some potential functions of
these binding TFs. For example, a change in the ability to fold
proteins adequately induces the unfolded protein response, which we
have previously implicated in antiestrogen resistance (Gomez et al.,
2007; Gu et al., 2002). Similarly, NFY, USF, P53, OCTl, GATA
and PBXl are only signiﬁcantly enriched in the late upregulation
condition. Signiﬁcant GO terms of their target genes include ‘cell
cycle’, ‘cell proliferation’, ‘mitosis’ and ‘DNA replication’ (P—value
<0.01). Among them, previous studies (Imbriano et al., 2005)
have shown that nuclear transcription factor Y (NFY) and p53 are
related to cell cycle arrest; Octamer transcription factor—1 (Oct—1)
is a member of the POU family of TFs and is involved in the
transcriptional regulation of a variety of gene expression related to
cell cycle regulation, development and hormonal signals (Kakizawa
et al., 2001); Upstream stimulatory factor 1 (USF) is a transcription
coactivator that plays a role in regulation of cell proliferation and
associated with breast neoplasms (Xing and Archer, 1998); Pre—B—
cell leukemia homeobox 1 (PBXl) is a transcription activator that
promotes TF activity and cell growth, which may play an important
role in Wnt receptor signaling (Hayward et al., 2005).

3.3.2 Estrogen-deprived condition We previously derived a
series of breast cancer variants that closely reﬂect clinical
phenotypes of endocrine sensitive and resistant tumors (Brunner
et al., 1997; Clarke et al., 1989). We selected two cell lines for
this study: MCF—7 and MCF—7 stripped. MCF—7 stripped denotes
estrogen—deprived MCF—7 human breast cancer cells, which were
grown in the absence of estrogen for 96 h. Three independent
total RNA samples were extracted for each cell line (MCF—
7 and MCF—7 stripped) and the samples were arrayed using
Affymetrix GeneChip HG—U133A. Raw data are available in GEO
(http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih. gov/geo/; accession number: GSE 20700).
We analyzed the enriched motifs and their targets for the genes
signiﬁcantly downregulated in MCF—7—stripped cells as compared to
MCF—7 cells. Downregulated genes are identiﬁed by SAM analysis
(Tusher et al., 2001) with FDR <0.05. Again, we applied the
ml—SVR approach for this study to identify signiﬁcant regulatory
networks (for more details about the procedure, please see Section
S5 in the Supplementary Material).

Supplementary Table S2 shows the identiﬁed signiﬁcant motifs,
their average P—values across all levels, number of probe sets in
the module and the description of the corresponding TFs. As in
the previous subsection, signiﬁcant motifs were selected when their
average P—values £0.05. From these motifs and their corresponding
TFs, we found several TFs that have known associations with breast
cancer, such as SP—l and NFKB (Bjornstrom and Sjoberg, 2005). For
the their target genes, the signiﬁcant GO terms functions are related
to cell cycle, intracellular membrane—bound, DNA replication, etc.
(P—value <0.01).

In Figure 3, we show a Venn diagram of signiﬁcantly enriched
motifs in both estrogen—induced and estrogen—deprived conditions.
We can see that SP—l is signiﬁcantly enriched in both conditions,
while AP—l is only enriched in the estrogen—induced condition and

Fig. 4. (a) Identiﬁed transcription regulatory modules of AP—l, SP—l and
NFKB in breast cancer study. (b) Gene expression patterns of target genes of
AP—1, SP—l and NFKB in estrogen—induced and estrogen—deprived conditions
(left), and the binding sites of AP—l, SP—l and NFKB on the promoter regions
of their target genes (right).

NFKB is only enriched in the estrogen—deprived condition. A number
of publications have reported that elevated AP—l and NFKB activities
are each associated with tamoxifen—resistant breast cancer (Pratt
et al., 2003; Riggins et al., 2005; 2008; Zhou et al., 2007). We
depicted these three transcription regulatory modules with their
target genes in Figure 4a. The interactions among the TFs ESR1,
AP—1, SP—1and NFKB are extracted from Human Protein Reference
Database (Mishra et al., 2006). Figure 4b shows the binding sites for
AP—1, SP—1 and NFKB in the promoter regions of their target genes,
and their expression patterns in both conditions. In the next section,
we provide a detailed description of the SP—1 network to establish
its function role in estrogen signaling and action. The detailed
description of AP—l and NFKB can be found in the Supplementary
Material (Fig. S6).

SP—1 motifs are signiﬁcantly enriched under both estrogen—
induced and estrogen—deprived conditions, but the role of this TF in
estrogen and antiestrogen signaling is less clear. Kim et al. (2003)
have reported that in breast cancer cells, E2 and antiestrogens can
both stimulate transcription on G/C—rich promoters via ER/SP—l
complexes. Table S3 (see the Supplementary Material) shows the
SP—1 target genes common to the estrogen—induced and estrogen—
deprived conditions. Among these genes, some of them have been
conﬁrmed to be regulated by SP—1 in previous studies, and may
have direct relevance to breast cancer, estrogen signaling and
antiestrogen resistance. For instance, it has been shown that the
TF SP1 can bind to the promoter of CXCL12 (Luker and Luker,
2006), and that estrogen—stimulated proliferation of ER+ T47D
breast cancer cells can be blocked by a speciﬁc antagonist of
the receptor for CXCL12 (Pattarozzi et al., 2008). MYBL2 (B—
MYB) is a ubiquitous protein required for mammalian cell growth,
and a study by Sala et al. (1999) showed that B—MYB functions
as a coactivator of SP1, binding to the 120 bp B—MYB promoter
fragment. Moreover, it has recently been shown that MYB L2 mRNA
expression is signiﬁcantly increased in breast cancer cells resistant
to the tamoxifen analogue Toremifene (Pennanen et al., 2009).
Finally the RET proto—oncogene, more commonly associated with

multiple endocrine neoplasia and medullary thyroid carcinoma, is
also known to be transcriptionally regulated by SP1 (Andrew et al.,
2000). Boulay et al. have reported that RET is induced by estrogens;
RET signaling enhances the proliferative effect(s) of estrogen in
ER+ MCF7 and T47D breast cancer cells, and RET is coexpressed
with ER in primary breast tumors (Boulay et al., 2008). We have
also observed RET mRNA overexpression in tamoxifen—resistant
SUM44 breast cancer cells (Riggins et al., 2008). These results
demonstrate that our method can successfully identify relevant TF
targets that play key, functional roles in estrogen signaling and action
in breast cancer.

4 DISCUSSION

Identiﬁcation of transcription regulatory modules has become
increasingly important to understand the molecular mechanisms
associated with cancer. Previous methods (Das et al., 2006; Gao
et al., 2004; Nguyen and D’Haeseleer, 2006; Ruan and Zhang,
2006; Yu and Li, 2005) focused on how to model the relationship
of TF binding and gene expression levels, assuming either active
TFs or target genes are known. However, it is a challenging
problem in many cancer studies due to signiﬁcant noise in
data sources: inaccurate motif binding information, noisy gene
expression data and incomplete knowledge of the biological problem
under study. The ml—SVR method is intended to address these
problems and simultaneously identify signiﬁcant TFs and their target
genes through a multilevel strategy. SVR is utilized because its
performance for combining binding motif information and gene
expression data is robust in the presence of noise; note that it
can also be extended to model the non—linear relationship between
binding information and expression data through kernel functions.
Clustering is used to group genes in multiple levels, in a coarse—to—
ﬁne way, to avoid hard split of the genes, which may be undesirable
considering the noises.

There are several issues for further investigation. The method
described here assumes that coexpressed genes should be
coregulated to some degree; hence, genes are clustered based on their
expression proﬁles alone. Recently, Gong et al. (2008) proposed
to cluster genes based on their gene expression data and binding
motif information together, which may provide more accurate gene
clusters for analysis. Another important issue that needs to be
addressed is how to determine an appropriate motif set for SVR
ﬁtting. In our experiment, we only focused on each individual TF
and their modules. However, ﬁnding the cooperative TFs is also
important for many biological studies. Due to the large number of
motifs under study (typically in a range of 50 to 500), it is not
feasible to consider all possible motif combinations when the order
of the motif set increases. In our recent work (Chen et al., 2008),
we developed a stepwise forward greedy search strategy, using a
modiﬁed loss function to ﬁnd the cooperative motifs in a given
gene set. Finally, the parameters in the algorithm need to be further
optimized in the future work.

5 CONCLUSION

We have proposed a multilevel two—step SVR method to identify
signiﬁcant condition—speciﬁc regulatory networks. Binding motif
information and gene expression data are integrated by SVR
followed by signiﬁcance analysis to ﬁnd the active motif sets.

A multilevel analysis strategy is further developed to help reduce
false positives for reliable regulatory module identiﬁcation. The
simulation study and the experiment on yeast cell cycle data
demonstrated the effectiveness of our method in identifying TF and
target genes. Furthermore, we studied two breast cancer cell line
datasets and the results showed that our method can successfully
identify condition—speciﬁc regulatory modules associated with
estrogen signaling in breast cancer.

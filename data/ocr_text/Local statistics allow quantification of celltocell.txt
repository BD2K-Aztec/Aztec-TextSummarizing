Abstract

Motivation: Quantifying variability in protein expression is a major goal of systems biology and
cell—to—cell variability in subcellular localization pattern has not been systematically quantified.
Results: We define a local measure to quantify cell—to—cell variability in high—throughput microscope
images and show that it allows comparable measures of variability for proteins with diverse subcellu—
lar localizations. We systematically estimate cell—to—cell variability in the yeast GFP collection and
identify examples of proteins that show cell—to—cell variability in their subcellular localization.
Conclusions: Automated image analysis methods can be used to quantify cell—to—cell variability in

microscope images.

1 Introduction

Quantitative characterization of variability in gene expression has
been a major area of research in systems biology (Pelkmans 2012;
Snijder and Pelkmans 2011). Time—lapse movies of reporter genes in
live—cell ﬂuorescence microscopy demonstrated differences in protein
expression between genetically identical cells (Elowitz et al. 2002;
Levine et al. 2013). Cell—to—cell variability in protein abundance was
measured for most yeast proteins (Newman et al. 2006) using high—
throughput ﬂow cytometry of the GFP collection (Huh et al. 2003).
Time—lapse ﬂuorescence microscopy experiments have also revealed
examples of proteins that show cell—to—cell variability in subcellular
localization (Cai et al. 2008). For example, the yeast stress—response
transcription factors Msn2 and Msn4 have been observed to continu—
ously shuttle between the cytoplasm and nucleus (Jacquet et al. 2003).

To our knowledge, cell—to—cell variability in subcellular localiza—
tion has not been systematically characterized. Here, we set out

to test whether cell—to—cell variability in protein abundance and sub—
cellular localization could be systematically extracted from large
image collections from automated microscopy. Still images have
been used to quantify cell—to—cell variability in yeast protein abun-
dance (Li et al. 2010), and advances in automated genetics and mi—
croscopy have led to large collections of yeast images (Huh et al.
2003; Riffle and Davis 2010). Recently, we and others have showed
that quantitative measurements of protein localization and abun—
dance can be extracted for single cells in these images (Handfield et
al. 2013; L00 et al. 2014). However, it is not obvious how to define
a metric that allows meaningful comparison of variability between
different proteins. In particular, proteins localized to different
subcellular compartments may show cell—to—cell variability simply
due to imaging artefacts (small organelles might be missed from
cells) or due to cell—to—cell variability in organelle size and shape. For
example, yeast mitochondria have highly variable size and shape

(Okamoto et al. 1998); proteins localized there will have more cell-
to—cell variability than cytoplasmic proteins simply because of the
underlying morphological variability. Another important complica—
tion is due to differential protein regulation during the cell—cycle that
creates cell—to—cell variability in asynchronously growing cells.
Previous studies of cell—to—cell variability in subcellular localization
have used protein specific measures. For example, a study of Crzl
quantified bursts of nuclear localization using the median intensity
of the five brightest pixels in each cell (Cai et al. 2008). While effect—
ive for that case, that approach is unlikely to generalize to other pro—
teins or be quantitatively comparable between proteins of differing
subcellular localizations.

As in efforts to analyze image—based measurements of morpho—
logical variability (Levy and Siegal 2008; Yvert et al. 2013), we de—
fine a local measure of variability, which we call ‘Relative
Variability’ (RV) and show that it can be used to compare variability
in both protein abundance and spatial pattern between proteins
with different subcellular localization classes. We compare our
image—based cell—to—cell variability estimates for protein abundance
(cell—to—cell variability in total fluorescence intensity) with previous
measurements from ﬂow cytometry and find reasonable agreement.
Because our analysis is based on images, we can also measure variabil—
ity in the subcellular localization pattern (which we quantify using the
spatial spread of the ﬂuorescence in each cell), which is not possible
using conventional ﬂow cytometry. We identify examples of proteins
that show cell—to—cell variability in their spatial distribution within the
cells. To our knowledge, this represents the first systematic measure—
ment of cell—to—cell variability in subcellular localization.

2 Methods

2.1 Image processing

High-resolution images of the yeast GFP collection were acquired
and analyzed by an automated pipeline described previously
(Handfield et al. 2013). Briefly, a highly expressed cytoplasmic RFP
was introduced into the GFP collection to facilitate automated
image analysis. High—resolution digital images (1331 x 1017, 12 bit)
were obtained of unsynchronized log phase cultures using confocal
ﬂuorescence microscopy (Opera, PerkinElmer) with a water-immer-
sion 63x objective and image depth of 0.6 pm. Object contours
were identified automatically using a combination of geometric el—
lipse fits and watershed approach. Budded cells are fit by two el—
lipses, and the cell stage of the pair is estimated using the size of the
bud cell. Each identified cell is assigned a confidence score we that
represents that probability that it is a yeast cell (and not an artefact or
misidentified a cell). We used the same single cell data from ~0.4 mil—
lion mother—bud pairs that we extracted for our previous study
(Handfield et al. 2013). The single cell data are available for download
(along with the image processing pipeline) at the author’s website.

2.2 Feature profiles for protein expression patterns

To define a local measure of cell—to—cell variability, we need to quan—
tify the similarity between each protein (represented by images of a
GFP—tagged strain) in our collection. To do so, we assign to each
protein, p, a profile, Zip of features. In principle, any image features
(or other measurements) that adequately capture the pattern can be
used, as long as the same features can be calculated for each protein
and proteins can be compared quantitatively in the feature space.
Here, we use four simple features (GFP intensity, expected distance
to GFP centre of mass, expected distance to cell periphery and
expected distance to bud neck) calculated in five discrete bins of bud

cell size (to capture change over the cell cycle) that we previously
showed can be used to recover most previously recognized subcellu—
lar localization patterns in our yeast image collection (Handfield et
al. 2013). For a given feature, X, for each protein, feature measure—
ments from mother and bud cells are assigned to different bins, so
that a total of 10 means (E[X]) and variances (Var[X]) are computed.
Elements of Zip have the form

E wcxc

W

5631;,"

E wcxf

W

Elsz'l =

Var[Xp,-] = — E[Xp,-]2

where xc is a feature measurement for the cell, c, that has been as—
signed the ith bin Bpi. To ensure that our estimates of variance were
reasonably accurate, strains that have less than five cells assigned to
any cell cycle bin are filtered out for the analysis, leaving 2860 pro—
teins in the analysis (1144 out of 4003 filtered).

2.3 Subcellular ‘spread’ feature

Although the local method we propose to measure variability can be
applied to any image feature (or more generally any observation of
interest), in this study we chose a single feature to measure spatial
variability, the ‘expected distance to GFP centre of mass’ (Handfield
et al. 2013). An empirical probability distribution fc for the subcel—
lular position of GFP protein can be obtained by normalizing the
GFP signal at each pixel coordinate E) = (zx, Zy) by the total GFP sig-
nal in the area of the cell (TC), such that

m = “in  To = 2 we 

_,
Z EA,

 

where AC is the set of pixel coordinates of a cell area. From the
above, we then define the coordinates of the GFP pattern centre of
mass, 5‘1, as the intensity weighted average of pixel coordinates. We
then define ‘expected distance to GFP centre of mass’, which we
refer to here as ‘subcellular spread’, by evaluating the distance to
centre of mass under the empirical probability distribution:

where the Hat — b|| represents the Euclidean distance between

vectors a and b, and summatlons 1n each case are over all the p1xels,

3, within the area of the cell.

2.4 Co—efficient of variation

The variability in positive quantities (such as protein abundance) is
usually quantified using the co—efficient of variation (CV, Newman
et al. 2006), given by the standard deviation divided by the mean.
Because we divided the cells into five cell—cycle bins, for mother and
bud cells, we took the geometric mean of the CV over the 10 bins
for protein, [9.

In this equation, log 2(3)) represents the base—2 logarithm of y
and E[X] and Var[X] are the mean and variance of the expected dis—
tance to centre of mass as defined above.

2.5 Relative variability

Our main methodological contribution is to introduce an alternative
method to estimate cell—to—cell variability in a feature measurement.
Specifically, we define the ‘relative variability’ as the log ratio of the
observed variance to the expected variance based what is observed
in ‘similar’ proteins in the image collection (Fig. 1). To compute this
local expected variance, we use a so—called conditional variance
estimator (CVE, Auestad and Tjostheim 1990; Hardle 1990). To
compute the CVE, we first variance standardize the profiles, T1),
such that COV(;t)1,. . ., Tilq) : I (Scott and Sain 2004), where C
indicates the set of all proteins in the collection and |C| indicates the
size of the set C. We then use a multivariate Gaussian kernel, Kbp,
to weight each protein q based on its similarity to the protein of
interest [9.

(low/270d 212:9 (
Where [OP is a bandwidth parameter (discussed below) and d is
the dimensionality of the feature space (length of T1), Scott and Sain
2004). We then compute the CVE, Var [X], for each protein, p, based
on the observed variability of all other proteins, q. We have:

where, once again, xc is a feature measurement for the cell, c, that
has been assigned the ith bin for protein q, Bq, and  indicates
the kernel regression (the conditional mean, Hardle 1990) of a fea—
ture X, in our case the subcellular spread feature or GFP intensity.
We note that Equation (6) differs from the standard formulas
(Auestad and Tjostheim 1990) because we carry through the cell
confidence, we, so that, e.g. we do not normalize by the total num—

ber of proteins, but rather the ’expected number’, :6 we. We com—

pute the CVE for each protein, p, in each cell cycle bin, 1'. Because
the data are non—uniformly distributed in the feature space, we use a
locally adaptive bandwidth parameter (Altman 1992; Simonoff
1996), lop, which we evaluate at each protein [J (Fig. 1). This scales
the kernel width to use a consistent number of ’similar’ proteins to

evaluate Va\r[X], so that the RV estimate for each protein is some—
what independent of scale of the differences in the local neighbour-
hood of ‘similar’ proteins (Breiman et al. 1977). To choose the
bandwidth for each protein, a fixed point iterative procedure was

used find the bandwidth, lop, such that:

0.05%-IC\{p}I=(IWZ?>" Z KWp—ch) <7)

q€C\{P}

where once again C indicates the set of all proteins in the collection
and d is the dimensionality of the feature space. By choosing lap to
satisfy equation (7), the number of neighbours considered for the
local estimate is a fixed fraction of the whole protein collection
(Breiman et al. 1977). In the following, we used 0.05% of the data,

Fig. 1. RV. A conditional variance estimate (\7a\r[]) is computed for a feature,
X, at every point in the feature space based on the nearby data points. For
points of interest (corresponding to proteins, indicated by p and q), a band-
width parameter hp is computed based on the density of points (proteins with
similar localization patterns) in that region of the space. The RV compares the
conditional variance estimate (surface) to the observed variability (bold P and
Q). In this example, the observed variability is high for protein p (P is above
the surface) and is low for q (0 is below the surface)

but we found that as long as the fraction was small enough, there
was little overall effect on the RV distribution (Supplementary
Information).

Previous studies have used deviations from LOESS regression
(Hastie and Loader 1993) of the variance on the mean to quantify
variability in image features (Levy and Siegal 2008; Yvert et al.
2013), which is also a local approach using a univariate measure of
the difference between proteins. In principle, many choices of simi-
larity measures between proteins could be used to compute the
CVE. We explored using lower dimensional measures, such as simi—
larity based only on the subcellular spread feature measurement and
found that this also yielded more comparable variability estimates
than the CV. However, we found that using the full feature profile
further improved the distributions of variability estimates for differ—
ent localization classes (Supplementary Information).

We define the RV for protein [J as the log of a geometric mean
over the 10 bins.

1% = i Zillog 2<variXpii> — log 2<vAar [X1710] (8)

1:1

We note that, rather than dividing the cell cycle into discrete
bins, it is also possible to use a kernel—based approach to estimate an
RV using all of the cells, weighted by their cell stage estimates. We
also implemented such an approach (see Supplementary
Information) and find that it gives overall qualitatively similar re—
sults to the binning strategy we used here. However, we consider
treating the cell stage as a series of independent categories to be a
more generally applicable approach, because in other applications,
there are likely to be high—dimensional, correlated sets of feature
measurements, but these might not be related by time. For example,
the discrete categories of features might be genetic or environmental
perturbations.

3 Results and discussion

Overview: We sought to quantify cell—to—cell variability from
images. Although the CV has been used previously to quantify vari—
ation in protein abundance, we find that the CV for our image—
derived measurements systematically varies between proteins in dif-
ferent subcellular localization classes, particularly when used to
quantify variability in spatial spread of protein expression. This
means that identifying highly variable proteins based on CV might
be biased towards identifying certain classes of proteins (such as nu—
cleolar and mitochondrial proteins). We show that this bias is much
less pronounced for the RV and test whether bona fide cell—to—cell
variable proteins can be identified by ranking proteins based on
the RV.

3.1 Quantifying cell—to—cell variability in protein
abundance from images

To test whether we could quantify cell—to—cell variability in protein
abundance from high—throughput images, we first extracted GFP in—
tensity measurements (which reflect protein abundance) from each
cell for each protein, computed the CV for the cells in each cell cycle
bin and averaged these. The CV is a standard measure of variability
for protein abundance (Bar—Even et al. 2006 ). We compared the re—
sults to high—throughput variability estimates for the yeast GFP col—
lection based on ﬂow cytometry (Newman et al. 2006 ). For
example, variable proteins identified previously, such as Pry3, ap—
pear highly variable in our images (Fig. 2a). We note that technically
we are not detecting Pry3 but rather the GFP—tagged fusion protein,

Pry3—GFP. However, for brevity, we omit the ‘—GFP’ throughout
when referring to our images; our images always show tagged fusion
proteins. Overall, we found a correlation of 0.333 with the deviation
to the median (DM) estimates of ‘noise’ (Newman et al. 2006).
Although this correlation far exceeds what could be expected by
chance (P < 10_10), there are many factors that we expect to affect
the agreement of the image measurements with the previous esti—
mates (Newman et al. 2006), such as different typical sample
sizes, different treatment of the cell cycle, correction for autoﬂuores—
cence, etc.

We were particularly interested in the effect that differences in
subcellular localization might have on the variability in protein
abundance inferred from images. To test this, we plotted our CV es—
timates for all the proteins in several localization classes defined
based on manual inspection of the original images of the GFP collec-
tion (Huh et al. 2003). We found that certain classes (e.g. nucleolus;
Fig. 2b) display skewed distributions of CVs (Fig. 2c). This variabil—
ity could be due to our imaging, as the nucleoli might be randomly
missing from the focal plane or to variability in organelle shape.
Regardless of the underlying reason, it is not fair to compare a vari—
ability estimate from a nucleolar protein to an estimate from a cyto—
plasmic protein, which will (almost) always be included in the focal
plane or whose shape variation is better accounted for by the cell
segmentation.

We designed the RV measure (see Section 2) to correct for differ-
ences in subcellular localization by comparing proteins’ variability
to ‘similar’ proteins in our protein expression feature space
(Handfield et al. 2013). Therefore, if the measure works correctly,

Fig. 3. Variability in protein subcellular localization. (A) CVs for a spatial feature are systematically biased by localization class. (B) RV estimates show much less
bias between classes. Eac  symbol represents the cell-to-cell variability for GFP spatial spread for a single strain (tagged protein) in the collection. (C) Spo12
shows cell-to-cell variability between nuclear and cytoplasmic localization. It has a typical CV for a nuclear protein (indicated by * in A and B) but has a high RV.
(D) Ade4 shows cell-to-cell variability in localization and is the most variable cytoplasmic protein, but it falls below many nucleolar and mitochondrial proteins ac-
cording to the CV. In contrast, according to the RV, it is one of the most highly variable proteins (indicated by ** in A and B)

the variability of a nucleolar protein will be compared with other
nucleolar proteins, because they display ‘similar’ protein expression
patterns. Consistent with this prediction, the distributions of RV
measurements for nucleolar proteins are much more similar to the
other classes than the CVs (Fig. 2d). For example, Pry3 shows dra—
matic cell—to—cell variability in our images (Fig. 2a) but has a CV that
is lower than 13 nucleolar proteins that do not appear highly vari-
able (e.g. Gar1, Fig. 2b). This is because ER proteins are biased to
appear less variable than nuclear and nucleolar proteins based on
the CV (Fig. 2c). In contrast, using the RV, Pry3 maintains its rank
within the ER subcellular location class but ranks higher than any
nucleolar protein (Fig. 2d). That the overall distributions of RVs for
proteins in previously defined subcellular localization classes (Huh
et al. 2003) are more similar than the CVs is supports the idea that a
local estimate of variability is better suited to identify examples of
unusually variable proteins. Furthermore, the correlation between
RV and the DM estimates (Newman et al. 2006) is 0.398, such that
RV explains nearly 5% more of the variance in the ﬂow cytometry
measured variability (DM) than does the image—based CV.

3.2 Quantifying cell—to—cell variability in subcellular
localization from images

We next sought to test whether we could quantify the cell—to—cell
variability in the spatial component of protein expression pattern.
We computed the subcellular spread (see Section 2) for each cell and
plotted its CV and RV (see Section 2) for several large classes of pro—
teins based on their subcellular localization as defined through in-
spection of the original GFP collection images (Huh et al. 2003).

As expected, we found even more pronounced biases in the CV be—
tween classes, such that classes with variable morphology (such as
mitochondria; Fig. 3a) and small organelles that might be out of the
focal plane (such as nucleolus) showed very different distributions of
CVs. Once again, we found that the RV effectively corrected these
distributions, so that proteins with outstanding variability in each
class were now ranked near the extremes of the entire RV distribu—
tion (Fig. 3b). For example, Sp012 shows cell—to—cell variability in
subcellular localization (varying between the cytoplasm and nucleus,
Fig. 3c) but is buried behind 330 proteins according to the CV.
However, in the RV distribution, it is ranked 27th in the collection.
The similarity of the RV distributions for proteins with very differ—
ent spatial patterns of GFP expression indicates that comparison
with nearby proteins yield comparable variability estimates, despite
the heterogeneity in subcellular localization patterns.

We note that given the annotations of subcellular localization
for each protein, it is possible to quantify cell—to—cell variability
using the CV (Figs. 2 and 3). For example, the most variable protein
cytoplasmic protein, in CV and RV, is Ade4 (Fig. 3d) and appears to
exhibit punctae of varying intensity, probably reflecting a response
to adenine starvation (Narayanaswamy et al. 2009). Indeed, pro—
teins at the extreme of the distribution for each class tend to be bona
fide variable proteins. However, this relies on the prior subcellular
categorization of proteins (Huh et al. 2003). In practice, proteins
may display localization to multiple organelles, have been annotated
as ambiguous or change their localization over the cell cycle
(Handfield et al. 2013) and therefore may not always fall into a sin—
gle localization class. Therefore, it is not possible to identify variable
examples systematically using the CV. Because the RV compares

3.3 Systematic search for cell—to—cell variable proteins

We next tested whether the RV (see Section 2) could systematically
identify proteins that show cell—to—cell variability in both intensity
and spatial spread in our images. We plotted the RV in subcellular
localization against the RV in protein abundance (Fig. 4), as we ex—
pect variability in one aspect to influence the other. We chose arbi—
trary cutoffs (dashed lines in Fig. 4a) to identify predicted proteins
likely to be variable in abundance, subcellular localization, both or
neither. The most extreme examples were Hsp78 (Fig. 4b) and
Rpc82 (Fig. 4c), which are identified as both abundance and subcel—
lular variable. Rpc82 shows bright nuclear localization in some cells
and very little ﬂuorescence in others, whereas Hsp78 shows very
bright dots mixed with a much dimmer mitochondrial pattern,

which is barely visible at the contrast settings used to clearly display
the bright dots).

Previous studies have identified a few yeast transcription factors
that stochastically translocate from the cytoplasm to the nucleus
(Cai et al. 2008; Jacquet et al. 2003). These proteins have been
studied in time—lapse movies, and it is currently unknown how many
other proteins of this type exist and whether cell—to—cell variability in
subcellular localization other than cytoplasm and nucleus can exist.
Consistent with the prevalence of nuclear—cytoplasmic variability,
we found several other proteins with high RV exhibiting nuclear lo-
calization in a subset of the cell population (Fig. 4d and e, Table1).
Because the environment of the cells in our images is expected to be
constant, these represent new candidates for stochastic nuclear—cyto—
plasmic translocation but could also represent static variability in
the cellular response to the growth conditions.

In addition to nuclear—cytoplasmic variability, the most variable
30 proteins according to RV (Table 1) include many subcellular lo—
cations. Some of these are rare and have a strong cell—stage depend—
ence (bud neck, spindle pole and bud specific), so that it is difficult
to visually assess cell—to—cell variability. Still, Ade4 (Fig. 2b) and

The top 30 spatially variable proteins ranked by RV (RV#) are listed. Their
ranks according to the CV (CV#) are also included for comparison.
Subcellular localization categories as deﬁned previously (Huh et al. 2003) are
also indicated. The total number of mother—bud pairs available for the ana-
lysis (Cells) is also indicated. A complete listing of all proteins we analyzed is
available as Supplementary Information.

genotypes.

dSubsequent experiments conﬁrmed variability in genetically identical cells.

Ena1 (Fig. 4f) appear to represent clear examples of spatial variabil—
ity. Visual inspection suggests that Ena1 is localized to the cell per—
iphery or to several punctae inside the cell. Ade4 (Fig. 3d) shows a
bright dot or bright cytoplasmic intensity. We were particularly
interested to identify proteins like Hsp78, Ena1 and Ade4, because
they show that spatial variability other than nuclear—cytoplasmic is
in principle possible; this type of variability can only be identified
using microscopy, and our analysis represents the first systematic ef—
fort to identify these. That many classes of cell—to—cell variability
could be identified using the RV in a single—feature measurement
suggests that prior knowledge of subcellular location is not needed
to detect unusual heterogeneity in spatial pattern.

To obtain a more objective measure of the power of our new
measure (RV) to identify cell—to—cell variability in subcellular local-
ization pattern, we examined images for the top 30 most spatially
variable proteins according to the RV and CV. The main difference
is that seven proteins with nuclear—cytoplasmic variability are found
in the group of 30 proteins with highest RV, whereas only three of
them are found using CV. In addition, two variable proteins (Ena1

and Ade4) with other localization patterns are identified by the RV
but not by the CV. Among the 10 proteins found in both rankings, 6
are localized to the mitochondria. The mitochondrion is an organ-
elle with a complex tubular network morphology but often also may
show a punctate pattern (Okamoto et al. 1998). Among mitochon—
drial proteins with highest CV or RV, several showed a punctate
pattern, but only Ald5 and Ilv2 (Fig. 4g) show a punctate pattern
with a brightness comparable to Hsp78. All three have high rank for
RV and CV (Table 1) consistent with the bias in the CV estimates
for mitochondrial proteins (Fig. 3A). Overall, based on our inspec—
tion of the images, 12 true positives are found in the 30 most vari—
able proteins using RV and only 5 are found using CV. This means
that the RV analysis has positive predictive power of ~40% com—
pared with ~17% for the CV.

False negatives are difficult to quantify, as a set of known ‘spa—
tially variable’ proteins is difficult to define. For instance, Crzl lo-
calizes to the nucleus if cells are treated with calcium (Cai et al.
2008) and Msn2 localizes to the nucleus as a general stress response
(Jacquet et al. 2003). For Msn2 and Crzl, only one and four cells
are found having protein with nuclear localization (out of 257 and
347 cells, respectively) in our images, likely because they were taken
of cells in standard growth conditions. RV and CV both fail to de—
tect this scarce variability (all ranks above 1400 out of 2860 pro—
teins). For this experiment, where the nuclear localization was not
induced, it is unclear whether to consider Crzl and Msn2 false
negatives.

An important limitation of the RV is that the local estimate of
the variance level for a given protein relies on ‘similar’ proteins. If a
protein has a pattern that has little similarity to any other protein
(e.g. due to cell—stage dependencies or unusual protein abundance
distributed into multiple subcellular locations), the local estimate of
the variance may not be a good estimate for that protein. Indeed,
several of the proteins we identify as most cell—to—cell variable in
subcellular localization are either known to show cell—cycle regu—
lated localization [Mcm6, Nguyen et al. (2000) and Ace2,
O’Conallain et al. (1999)] or are cell—cycle regulated proteins whose
subcellular localization has not been characterized [Sp012, Tomson
et al. (2009) and Net1, Visintin et al. (1999)] These proteins may be
examples of proteins with unusual cell—cycle patterns. However, it is
also possible that our simple strategy of binning cells according to
bud size does not fully capture the cell—cycle variation in their pro-
tein expression.

The correspondence of our statistical approach and our examin—
ation of images (Fig. 4) confirms our computational methodology but
does not provide confirmation of biological relevance of the cell—to—cell
variability we identified. Because the microscope setup, medium com—
position, long—term storage of strain collections and other factors can
affect the consistency of GFP—patterns, we first reimaged several of the
variable proteins identified (Hsp78, be1, Rpc82, ch1, Rnr4 and
Ume1) and confirmed that the images in our high—throughput collec—
tion accurately reﬂected the GFP collection (Supplementary
Information). Because high—throughput analysis of the GFP collection
is typically done using automated liquid handling from 384—well plates,
we next sought to confirm that the observed variability was indeed due
to differences in protein expression among genetically identical cells.
We tested this by streaking out individual colonies from the variable
strains and imaging the resulting cultures. In several cases, we found
that individual cultures did not recapitulate the variable pattern
observed in the collection strain. For example, individual colonies from
Rpc82 and be1 showed homogeneous subcellular localization
patterns (nuclear or cytoplasmic, but never both, Table 1 and
Supplementary Information) strongly suggesting that the strains in the

collection represent mixtures: the variability we observe is due to gen—
etic differences and is not due to ‘noise’ in protein expression. We note
that the variability for Rpc82 is clearly visible in the original GFP col-
lection images (Huh et al. 2003), indicating that the mixture of strains
has persisted. On the other hand, individual colonies from Rnr4 and
Ume1 recapitulated the variability observed in the image collection and
showed variability even in cells with buds in the same size range
(Table 1 and Supplementary Information). Consistent with our obser—
vations, a mixed cytoplasmic and nuclear localization pattern for Rnr4
has been noted in response DNA damage (Yao et al. 2003). Ume1 may
represent a new example of a protein with variable subcellular localiza—
tion pattern. Nevertheless, we note that the variability we observe may
simply be due to insufficient nutrients or other cultivation conditions
(Narayanaswamy et al. 2009). Further experiments will be needed to
determine the biological causes and consequences of the variability we
have identified. Taken together, these experiments confirm that statis—
tical analysis of high—throughput microscopy images can identify pro—
teins with variability in subcellular localization.

4 Conclusion

We defined a local statistic to compare cell—to—cell variability, which
alleviates potential biases arising from heterogeneity of subcellular
localization of proteins. We performed the first systematic search
for the most spatially variable proteins and found several examples
of proteins that show variability in their subcellular localization pat—
tern. These include new classes of cell—to—cell variability, where cyto—
plasm, mitochondria and cell periphery are mixed with the
occurrence of bright punctae. This demonstrates that a statistical
analysis of still images can be used to quantify cell—to—cell variability
in protein abundance and subcellular localization pattern. We be—
lieve that local statistics will be useful for other high—throughput
data analysis applications, where data are highly heterogeneous, but
clear boundaries between classes cannot be defined.

Abstract

Summary: The R/Bioconductor package Protein Array Analyzer (PAA) facilitates a flexible analysis
of protein microarrays for biomarker discovery (esp., ProtoArrays). It provides a complete data ana—
lysis workflow including preprocessing and quality control, uni— and multivariate feature selection
as well as several different plots and results tables to outline and evaluate the analysis results. As a
main feature, PAA’s multivariate feature selection methods are based on recursive feature elimin—
ation (e.g. SVM—recursive feature elimination, SVM—RFE) with stability ensuring strategies such as
ensemble feature selection. This enables PAA to detect stable and reliable biomarker candidate

panels.

1 Introduction

Protein microarrays (PMs) such as the ProtoArray by Thermo Fisher
Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA, are used for autoimmune antibody
screening studies, e.g. to discover biomarker candidate panels in
human body ﬂuids to discriminate two groups of samples (e.g. ‘dis—
eased’ and ‘controls’). For ProtoArray data analysis the software
Prospector is often used because it provides the advantageous uni—
variate feature ranking approach minimum M statistic (mMs)
(Love, 2007) and a ProtoArray—specific robust linear model normal-
ization (rlm) (Sboner et 61]., 2009). However, since Prospector pro—
vides hardly any further functionality for biomarker discovery it is a
quite limited tool (Turewicz et 61]., 2013). Therefore, we have
adopted and extended Prospector’s key features (mMs, rlm) and im-
plemented PAA which provides a complete data analysis pipeline for
ProtoArrays and other single color PMs.

2 PAA workflow

The adaptable PAA workﬂow consists of siX parts (see Fig. 1) which
are described in the following subsections.

2.1 Data import

PAA imports microarray data in gpr file format. Therefore, it pro—
vides the function loadGPR which imports all needed data into an
object of class EListRaw (Expression List). To load the desired files
and pass metadata not contained in the gpr files (e.g. mapping be-
tween sample IDs and gpr files, batch information, clinical data,
etc.) a so called targets file has to be created previously and provided
to loadGPR. In case of ProtoArrays, spot duplicates are condensed
by taking the smaller value or taking the mean after data import.
Besides ProtoArrays, data of all one color microarrays in gpr file for-
mat (e.g. other PMs) can be imported.

2.2 Preprocessing and quality control

PAA provides several different preprocessing methods to make all
PM intensity values inter— and intra—array—wise comparable. E.g.
batch effects must be minimized when PMs from different manufac-
turing lots are compared in large studies (Turewicz et 61]., 2013).
Therefore, PAA provides the function batchilter to detect and dis—
card differential features between PM manufacturing lots.
Furthermore, the function batchdjust can be used to adjust for
known microarray batches. The function normalizeArrays provides

cific rlm approach which uses specific control spots has been reim—
plemented for PAA. Brieﬂy, the model

where 32,773, is the measured spot signal in log2 scale (of array 1', block
1', feature [a and replicate r), at,- is the array effect, ﬂl- is the block ef—
fect, 1k is the actual feature signal and Gil-k, is a random error
(Gil-k, N N (0,02)) is fitted using robust regression to compute the
corrected intensities via 39,7,” : 2A(y,-,-k, —1— cc,- —1— ﬂ). Other normaliza-
tion approaches provided by normalizeArrays are: cyclic loess,
quantile and vsn. To assist in choosing an appropriate normalization
method, PAA offers two functions: plotMAPlots drawing MA plots
and plotNormMet/oods drawing box plots visualizing differences be—
fore and after normalization. For quality control, the function
plotArray reconstructs the original spot positions from gpr files to
draw a plot mimicking the original scan image and to visualize PMs
for which no scan image is available. Then, visual inspection of the
spatial intensity pattern can identify strong local tendencies and spa—
tial biases. Moreover, PMs can be inspected after each preprocessing
step in order to check the impact of the applied methods.

2.3 Differential analysis

PAA offers univariate biomarker discovery with fold change and
P—value calculation via the functions diffAnalysis, pz/aluePlot and
volcanoPlot.

2.4 Biomarker candidate selection

Biomarker candidate selection via feature selection methods is the
central task in computational biomarker discovery. Multivariate
approaches based on embedded classifier algorithms model feature
interdependencies, interact with the classifier and result in more ac—
curate classifications than simpler strategies (Saeys et al., 2007).
Hence, PAA comes with three recursive feature elimination (RFE) al-
gorithms: (i) a reimplementation of SVM—RFE (Guyon et al., 2002)
which utilizes the weights of linear SVMs; (ii) a similar RFE ap-
proach using Random Forests (RFs) (Jiang et al., 2004) called RF—
RFE; (iii) an interface to RJ-RFE, the RFE method of the C—l——l—
package Random jungle (RJ) (Schwarz et al., 2010) which is a fast
RF reimplementation. All three variants of RFE can be called via the
function selectFeatures and are embedded in frequency—based

feature selection (FFS) (Baek et al., 2009) and ensemble feature se—
lection (EFS) (Abeel et al., 2010) which are strategies that ensure sta—
ble and reliable biomarker panels.

2.5 Feature preselection

Because RFE embedded in FFS or EFS are computationally expen-
sive multivariate methods for large datasets (e.g. group sizes >30
each) it is often beneficial to reduce the number of variables before—
hand. Therefore, PAA provides several univariate preselection meth—
ods via the function preselect. The default method is mMs
(implemented in C—l——l— to improve run times) which provides a
P—value based on an urn model (similar approach to the hypergeo—
metric test). Besides mMs, PAA provides t test— and MRMR—based
(Peng et al., 2005) preselection.

2.6 Biomarker candidates inspection

PAA returns various output for results evaluation. E.g. the plots re—
turned by pz/aluePlot and volcanoPlot visualize differential features
from the univariate perspective. ROC curves and results files outlin—
ing the classification performance can be returned by selectFeatures.
After feature selection the resulting biomarker candidate panel can
be inspected. Therefore, PAA comes with three functions: (i)
plotFeatures plots the fluorescence intensities of the selected bio—
marker candidates in group specific colors (one sub—figure per candi—
date) in order to visualize the differences; (ii) the selected panel and
all related protein information can be saved via printFeatures into a
txt file suitable for analysis with external tools (e.g. annotation); (iii)
a heat map of the candidate panel can be plotted by
plotFeaturesHeatmap as an alternative to plotFeatures.

3 Conclusion

PAA provides a comprehensive toolbox and an adaptable workﬂow
for PM data analysis. It comprises the most important methods of
Prospector and goes far beyond. Especially the multivariate feature
selection based on RFE embedded in FFS or EFS, which is a cutting
edge strategy for biomarker discovery, enables PAA to identify sta—
ble and reliable feature panels. Finally, PAA is ﬂexible since the
R/Bioconductor framework facilitates workflow extension and
customization.

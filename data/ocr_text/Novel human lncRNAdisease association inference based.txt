ABSTRACT

Motivation: More and more evidences have indicated that long—non-
coding RNAs (lncRNAs) play critical roles in many important biological
processes. Therefore, mutations and dysregulations of these lncRNAs
would contribute to the development of various complex diseases.
Developing powerful computational models for potential disease-
related lncRNAs identification would benefit biomarker identification
and drug discovery for human disease diagnosis, treatment, prognosis
and prevention.

Results: In this article, we proposed the assumption that similar
diseases tend to be associated with functionally similar lncRNAs.
Then, we further developed the method of Laplacian Regularized
Least Squares for anRNA—Disease Association (LRLSLDA) in the
semisupervised learning framework. Although known disease—
lncRNA associations in the database are rare, LRLSLDA still obtained
an AUC of 0.7760 in the leave-one-out cross validation, significantly
improving the performance of previous methods. We also illustrated
the performance of LRLSLDA is not sensitive (even robust) to the
parameters selection and it can obtain a reliable performance in all
the test classes. Plenty of potential disease—lncRNA associations were
publicly released and some of them have been confirmed by recent
results in biological experiments. It is anticipated that LRLSLDA could
be an effective and important biological tool for biomedical research.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is well known that genetic information is stored in protein-
coding genes, which are referred to as the central dogma of mo-
lecular biology (Crick et al., 1961; Yanofsky, 2007). Therefore,
RNA is only considered to be an intermediary between a DNA
sequence and its encoded protein during a considerable long
period (Mattick and Makunin, 2006). Recent studies have
shown that protein-coding genes account for only a small frac-
tion of the human genome (~l.5%). In other words, >98% of
the human genome does not encode protein sequences (Bertone
et al., 2004; Birney et al., 2007; Carninci et al., 2006; Claverie,

2005; Core et al., 2008; Kapranov et al., 2007; Lander et al.,
2001; Taft et al., 2010; Wilusz et al., 2009). Especially, it has
been observed that the proportion of non—protein—coding
sequence increases with the complexity of organisms (Taft
et al., 2007). These facts challenge forementioned traditional
view of RNA. Furthermore, accumulating evidences have
shown that non-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) normally play a critical
role in various biological processes. Specially, long—non-coding
RNAs (lncRNAs) are a class of important ncRNAs with the
length >200 nt (Kapranov et al., 2007; Mercer et al., 2009;
Wapinski and Chang, 2011). In the past few years, increasing
number of lncRNAs have been discovered in eukaryotic organ-
isms ranging from nematodes to humans with the rapid devel-
opment of both experimental technology and computational
methods (Amaral et al., 2011). It has also been shown that the
expression levels of lncRNAs appear to be lower than protein-
coding genes (Babak et al., 2005; Bono et al., 2003; Gibb et al.,
2011; Guttman et al., 2010; Ramskold et al., 2009), and some
lncRNAs have high tissue speciﬁcity (Gibb et al., 2011; Mercer
et al., 2008; Pauli et al., 2012; Ponting et al., 2009).
Accumulating evidences have indicated that plenty of
lncRNAs play critical roles in many important biological pro-
cesses, including transcription, translation, splicing, differenti-
ation, epigenetic regulation, immune responses, cell cycle
control and so on (Bu et al., 2012; Chen et al., 2013; Lander
et al., 2001; Managadze et al., 2011; Mattick, 2009; Mattick and
Makunin, 2006; Mitchell Guttman et al., 2009; Qureshi et al.,
2010; Wapinski and Chang, 2011; Wilusz et al., 2009). Therefore,
mutations and dysregulations of lncRNAs are associated with a
broad range of human diseases (Mercer et al., 2009; Ponting
et al., 2009; Taft et al., 2010; Wapinski and Chang, 2011), such
as cancers (Chung et al., 2011; Gupta et al., 2010; Spizzo et al.,
2012; van Poppel et al., 2011; Yang et al., 2011; Zhang et al.,
2012), cardiovascular diseases (Congrains et al., 2011) and neu-
rodegeneration diseases (Johnson, 2011). For example, lncRNA
HOTAIR, PCA3 and UCAl have been treated as potential
biomarker of hepatocellular carcinoma recurrence (Yang et al.,
2011), prostate cancer aggressiveness (van Poppel et al., 2011)
and bladder cancer diagnosis, respectively (Zhang et al., 2012).
Therefore, identifying potential human disease-related lncRNAs
can facilitate not only the understanding of molecular mechan-
isms of human disease at lncRNA level, but also biomarker
identiﬁcation for human disease diagnosis, treatment, prognosis
and prevention (Chen et al., 2013). So far, plenty of studies have
generated a large amount of lncRNA-related biological data
about sequence, expression, function and so on. These datasets

have been stored in some publicly available databases, such as
NRED (Dinger et al., 2009), lncRNAdb (Amaral et al., 2011),
NONCODE (Bu et al., 2012). However, only relatively few
lncRNA—disease associations have been reported. Developing
powerful computational models based on these datasets to pre-
dict potential disease—lncRNA associations on a large scale has
been treated as one of the most important topics of lncRNAs
and diseases. Computational model can provide most promising
lncRNA—disease associations for further experimental valid-
ation, hence decrease the time and cost of biological experiments.

In the previous work, we have manually collected experimen-
tally reported disease—lncRNA associations and constructed the
ﬁrst lncRNA—disease association database, anRNADisease
(http://cmbi.bjmu.edu.cn/lncrnadisease) (Chen et al., 2013).
This database has included >480 lncRNA—disease associations,
~208 lncRNAs and 166 diseases and laid the solid data funda-
ment for lncRNA-related predictive research. Furthermore, we
obtained an important conclusion that lncRNAs tend to be
related to the same disease as their genomic neighbor genes
and developed a simple lncRNA—disease association prediction
method based on the genomic context of a given lncRNA (Chen
et al., 2013). The conclusion obtained in this study laid the solid
theoretical fundament for disease—lncRNA association predic-
tion research. Based on this conclusion, various disease-related
lncRNA prediction methods can be developed.

In this article, we logically extended the basic assumption in
the previous disease-microRNA (miRNA) association prediction
research (Chen et al., 2012a, b) and proposed the following as-
sumption for disease-related lncRNA prediction: similar diseases
tend to be associated with functionally similar lncRNAs. Based
on this assumption and the fact that selecting lncRNAs that are
not related to the given disease is currently difﬁcult or even
impossible, we developed a computational model of Laplacian
Regularized Least Squares for anRNA—Disease Association
(LRLSLDA) in the semisupervised learning framework. This
method prioritizes the entire lncRNAome for disease of interest
by integrating known phenome-lncRNAome network obtained
from the database of anRNADisease, disease similarity net-
work and lncRNA similarity network. LRLSLDA is a global
approach that can rank candidate disease—lncRNA pairs for all
the diseases simultaneously. In the leave-one—out cross validation
(LOOCV), LRLSLDA obtained the reliable AUC of 0.7760,
demonstrating superiority performance of LRLSLDA to previ-
ous methods and potential value for disease-related lncRNA pre-
diction and biomarker detection in the diagnosis, treatment,
prognosis and prevention of human disease. We also classiﬁed
test samples of lncRNA—disease associations into distinct classes,
and LRLSLDA obtained reliable performance in different test
classes. Plenty of potential disease—lncRNA associations were
publicly released for experimental veriﬁcation. Some of the
associations have been conﬁrmed by recent results in biological
experiments.

2 MATERIALS

2.1 anRNA—disease associations

We downloaded known lncRNA—disease association dataset
from the anRNADisease database in October, 2012. This

dataset is used as gold standard dataset in the cross validation
and training dataset in potential disease—lncRNA association
prediction. After getting rid of duplicate associations, 293 dis-
tinct experimentally conﬁrmed lncRNA—disease associations
were obtained, including 118 lncRNAs and 167 diseases
(Supplementary Table S1). We denoted variable nl as the
number of lncRNAs, nd as the number of diseases, matrix A
as the adjacency matrix of lncRNA—disease associations, where
A{i,j) in row 1' column j is 1 if lncRNA l{ j ) is related to the
disease d{i), otherwise 0.

2.2 anRNA expression similarity

Considering the current situation that comprehensive expression
data of lncRNA is still unavailable and the fact that long inter-
genic non-coding RNA (lincRNA) accounts for a large fraction
of the whole lncRNA set, we downloaded lincRNA expression
proﬁles from UCSC Genome Bioinformatics (http://genome.
ucsc.edu/) in October, 2012, including the expression proﬁles
of 21626 lincRNAs in 22 human tissues or cell types
(Supplementary Table S2). Then, we deﬁned the lincRNA
expression similarity as the Spearman correlation coefﬁcient be-
tween the expression proﬁles of each lincRNA pair. Matrix SPC
is denoted as the lncRNA expression similarity matrix, where
SPC{i,j) in row 1' column j is the expression similarity between
lncRNA [(1') and l{ j ) if they are both lincRNA, otherwise 0.
LRLSLDA developed in this article can be applied to inter-
actions prediction between all the lncRNAs (not only
lincRNAs, but also other members of lncRNA) and diseases
by integrating lncRNA—disease association data and lncRNA
expression data. Making use of Spearman correlation coefﬁcient
between the expression proﬁles of each pair is the general method
in bioinformatics research. Hence, it is likely that this similarity
measure would still obtain reliable performance for lncRNA
expression data, as already shown for lincRNAs in this article.

3 METHODS
3.1 Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity for
diseases

Based on the assumption that similar diseases tend to show a similar
interaction and non-interaction pattern with the lncRNAs, we con-
structed Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity for disease from
known lncRNA—disease associations [motivated by van Laarhoven et al.
(2011)]. The procedures of Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity
have been illustrated in Figure l. Firstly, we denoted the interaction
proﬁle IP (dﬁ) ) of disease d(i) as the binary vector encoding the presence
or absence of association between disease d(i) and each lncRNA in the
known disease—lncRNA association dataset, i.e. the ith row of the adja-
cency matrix A. Then, we introduced Gaussian kernel for the interaction
proﬁles of diseases. Kernel for disease d(i) and d( j ) was deﬁned as
follows and used as the similarity score between these two diseases.

KD(d(i)»d(j)) = €XP(—)/d ll IP(d(i)) — 1P(d(j)) llz)

where the parameter yd controls the kernel bandwidth. It was normally
deﬁned as a new bandwidth parameter 7/9 normalized by the average
number of associations with lncRNA per disease. Although this new
bandwidth parameter can be better selected through further cross valid-
ation, here for simplicity we set yé, = 1 according to the choice in the

Fig. 1. The procedures of Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity
calculation based on known disease—lncRNA association network have
been divided into three steps: constructing known disease—lncRNA asso-
ciation network; obtain interaction proﬁles of diseases and lncRNAs,
respectively; calculate Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity for
diseases and lncRNAs, respectively. Similarity used in the table of bottom
panels is Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity for diseases and
lncRNAs, respectively

previous work (van Laarhoven et a[., 2011). The formula for the calcu-
lation of yd is

1 nd
W = mg; ||IP(d(i)||2)
i=1

Finally, KD is denoted as Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity
matrix for diseases, where the entity KD(i,j) in row 1' column j is the
Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel for disease d(i) and d( j ). From rele-
vant research (V anunu et a[., 2010), we could obtain the conclusion that
disease similarity after logistic function transformation can improve pre-
dictive accuracy of disease-related problems. Therefore, we used the
logistic function in the previous study (V anunu et a[., 2010) as follows:

. - 1
Spam), do» = 

For the two parameters contained in this formula, we adopt the same
parameter selection as previous study (Vanunu et a[., 2010), i.e.
c = —15,d = log(9999). Disease similarity matrix SD will be used in
the optimal classiﬁer construction in the following sections.

3.2 Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity for
lncRNAs

Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity matrix for lncRNAs, KL,
can be constructed in a similar way as follows:

KL(l(i)J(j)) = €XP(—i/z ll IP(l(i)) — 1P(l(j)) llz)

where IP([(i)) for lncRNA [(1') is the binary vector encoding the presence
or absence of association between lncRNA [(i) and each disease and 7/;
controls the kernel bandwidth, which can be obtained as follows by
normalizing a new bandwidth parameter y; [y[’ = 1, according to the
choice in the previous work (van Laarhoven et a[., 2011)].

1 n[
w = Vi/(n—IZ ||1P(l(i)||2)
i=1

Based on the forementioned lncRNA expression similarity and Gaussian
interaction proﬁle kernel similarity, we constructed lncRNA integrated
similarity matrix SL, where the entity SL(i,j) in row 1' column j is inte-
grated similarity between lncRNA [(i) and l (j) deﬁned as follows and ew
is the weight coefﬁcient of lncRNA expression similarity.

3.3 Laplacian Regularized Least Squares for
anRNA—Disease Association

Based on the underlying assumption that similar diseases tend to be
associated with similar lncRNAs, here we developed the method of
LRLSLDA to predict the potential related lncRNAs for the disease of
interest. The ﬂowchart of LRLSLDA has been shown in Figure 2, includ-
ing the steps of similarity calculation and Laplacian normalization, cost
function construction and optimal classiﬁer function calculation, and
optimal classiﬁer function combination. Based on the framework of
Laplacian Regularized Least Squares (LapRLS), aforementioned
assumption will be formulated into two classiﬁers in the disease space
and lncRNA space, respectively. Then these two classiﬁers will be com-
bined into a single classiﬁer by a simple mean operation to give ﬁnal
prediction about disease—lncRNA association probability. It is antici-
pated that this classiﬁer would be a continuous classiﬁcation function,
which could reﬂect the probability that each lncRNA is associated with
all the diseases of interest. Hence, following two criterions were used to
evaluate constructed classiﬁer: (i) the classiﬁer should comply with known
lncRNA—disease associations as accurately as possible; (ii) the classiﬁer
should be smooth over disease space and lncRNA space, i.e. the scores
for the potential association between similar lncRNAs (diseases) and the
same disease (lncRNA) should be similar, which reﬂect aforementioned
basic assumption. Candidate lncRNA—disease pairs with high scores will
be expected to have a high priority for biological experiments validation.
In this way, we could dramatically reduce the costs and time for potential
lncRNA—disease association identiﬁcation.

In the framework of LapRLS, Laplacian operation will be ﬁrstly
implemented to normalize the similar matrix used in the classiﬁer con-
struction as follows:

LD 2 (DD)‘1/2(DD — SD)(DD)‘1/2

LL 2 (DL)‘1/2(DL — SL)(DL)‘1/2

where the diagonal matrices DD and DL are deﬁned such that DD(i,i)
and DL(i,i) are the sum of the ith row of SD and SL, respectively.
Then, cost functions will be deﬁned in lncRNA space and disease space,
respectively. The optimal classiﬁer meeting above criterions will be
obtained by minimizing this cost function. In the lncRNA space, opti-
mal classiﬁer can be obtained by solving the following optimization
problem:

. 2 2
%n[||AT — FL||F+77L||FL - LL - FLT||F]

where ||-||F is the Frobenius norm and 77L is the trade-off parameter. We
solved this optimization problem by calculating the derivative of this

objective function (Belkin et a[., 2006; Xia et a[., 2010). The optimal
classiﬁcation function can be obtained as follows:

FL* 2 SL(SL + 27L - LL - SL)AT

We can also obtain the optimal classiﬁcation function in the disease space
in a similar way by solving the following optimization problem:

. 2
nl%n[||A — FDIIi~+ UDIIFD ‘ LD ‘ FDTIIF]

FD* = SD(SD + 27D - LD - SD)A

where 17D is also the trade-off parameter. According to the choice in the
previous work (van Laarhoven et a[., 2011), we set 17L 2 1, 17D 2 1.

Finally, we combined the optimal classiﬁers in the lncRNA space and
disease space into a single classiﬁer by a simple mean operation:

F* =[w-FL*T+(1—[w)-FD*

where [w is denoted as the weight coefﬁcient of the classiﬁcation function
in the lncRNA space and the entity F"(i, j) in row i column j reﬂect the
probability that lncRNA [ (j) is related to the disease d( i).

4 RESULTS

4.1 Leave-one-out cross validation

LOOCV was implemented on the known experimentally veriﬁed
lncRNA—disease associations to evaluate the performance of

LRLSLDA. Here, we combined the lncRNA expression similar-
ity and Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity matrix for
lncRNAs into the integrated similarity by a simple mean oper-
ation according to the previous studies (Chen et a[., 2012a, c) and
will discuss the parameter effect on the predictive performance in
the next section. For the weight coefﬁcients in the ﬁnal optimal
classiﬁer function combination, we implemented similar average
operation for classiﬁer combination according to previous suc-
cessful studies about drug-target prediction and disease-related
miRNA environmental factor (EF) interaction prediction (Chen
et a[., 2012a; Xia et a[., 2010). It has been observed from Figure 3
that combined classiﬁer can signiﬁcantly improve the predictive
accuracy of classiﬁer in the single space. Also we will discuss
whether this parameter selection would have a great inﬂuence
on the predictive performance in the next section. To our know-
ledge, this is the ﬁrst work making use of known lncRNA—
disease associations to predict potential ones. Therefore, no pre-
vious methods can be compared with our method. We will com-
pare LRLSLDA with the predictive result of classiﬁers in the
single space to show the reasonability of combining classiﬁers
in different spaces into ﬁnal predictive results.

Because there were 167 diseases and 293 disease—lncRNA
associations in the known golden standard dataset, i.e. less
than two associations per disease, it is inappropriate and infeas-
ible to implement LOOCV for a given disease d. Further, taking
into account the fact that LRLSLDA is a global method (i.e. it
can prioritize candidate lncRNAs for all the disease simultan-
eously and can compare the scores of different lncRNA—disease
pairs), we implemented LOOCV for all the diseases simultan-
eously. We left out each known disease—lncRNA association in
turn as test sample and further evaluate how well this association
was ranked relative to the candidate samples. Here, all other
known disease—lncRNA associations were regarded as training
samples, and all the disease—lncRNA pairs without conﬁrmed
associations were regarded as candidate samples. Receiver-
operating characteristics (ROC) curve was used to evaluate the
predictive performance, which plots true-positive rate (TPR, sen-
sitivity) versus false-positive rate (FPR, l-speciﬁcity) at different
rank cutoffs. Here, sensitivity means the percentage of the left-
out associations obtaining the ranking higher than a given rank
cutoff; Speciﬁcity means the percentage of candidate associations
obtaining the ranking lower than this given rank cutoff. When
we vary the rank cutoffs of successful prediction, we can obtain
the corresponding TPR and F PR. In this way, ROC was drawn
and AUC was calculated.

The similarity measure deﬁned in this article relies on
Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel similarity, which is calculated
from known disease—lncRNA associations. When LOOCV was
implemented, each known disease—mcRNA association was con-
sidered as test sample in turn. Therefore, we would obtain dif-
ferent similarity matrice because of different training samples in
the each step of LOOCV (training samples were different when
different known associations were considered as test samples,
hence obtaining different similarity matrice). Therefore, it is
necessary to recalculate Gaussian interaction proﬁle kernel simi-
larity for disease and lncRNA (not a ﬁxed similarity matrix in
the whole process of LOOCV) in the each step of LOOCV when
each known lncRNA—disease association is left out as test
sample. As a result, LRLSLDA achieved an AUC of 0.7760

Fig. 3. Comparison between LRLSLDA and the classiﬁer in the single
space was shown, which was implemented based on LOOCV schema in
terms of ROC curve and AUC. The result demonstrates LRLSLDA has
a reliable performance for potential lncRNA—disease inference and shows
the beneﬁt from combining the classiﬁers from different spaces into the
single one. We also implemented LOOCV based on the LRLSLDA with-
out introducing the information of expression proﬁles. A slightly lower
AUC has been obtained, which shows the beneﬁt from the introduction
of expression proﬁles and relative reliable predictive ability even if the
information of expression proﬁles can not be obtained for lncRNAs of
interest

and the comparison between LRLSLDA and the predictive
results in the single space (disease space or lncRNA space) was
shown in Figure 3. The conclusion can be reached that predictive
accuracy has been signiﬁcantly improved by the operation of
combining the classiﬁers in different spaces. We further imple-
mented LOOCV based on the LRLSLDA without introducing
the information of expression proﬁles. The AUC of 0.7317 has
been obtained (Fig. 3), which was slightly lower than LRLSLDA
with expression information. From this comparison, we can
reach the following two conclusions. For one thing, the perform-
ance of LRLSLDA could be further improved by introducing
the information of expression proﬁles. For another, we still can
obtain the relative reliable predictive results even if the informa-
tion of expression proﬁles can not be obtained for lncRNAs of
interest. Considering that each disease is only associated with less
than two diseases on average in the known disease—lncRNA
associations, the performance of LRLSLDA is reliable and
would be further improved after obtaining more known
disease—lncRNAs associations.

4.2 The effect of weight coefﬁcients on LRLSLDA
performance

There are two kinds of weight coefﬁcients in LRLSLDA: com-
binatorial coefﬁcients in integrated lncRNA similarity and the
ﬁnal classiﬁer, respectively.

In the previous researches of disease-related miRNA-EF inter-
actions prediction and drug target prediction, simple average was
adopted to combine different similarity measures of drug, pro-
tein target, miRNA and EF, respectively, where reliable perform-
ance have been obtained (Chen et a[., 2012a, 0). Even in the study
about drug target interactions prediction, the robustness of

predictive accuracy to weight parameters selection has been illu-
strated. No accurate and practical methods for similarity inte-
gration have been developed and applied well to bioinformatics
research so far. In the Supplementary Figure S1, we showed the
AUC values under different lncRNA similarity weights in the
framework of LOOCV. We again observed the predictive accur-
acy of LRLSLDA is robust to the selection of lncRNA similarity
weight coefﬁcients.

Currently, there are no good methods for the selection of
weight coefﬁcients to combine different classiﬁcation functions
into the ﬁnal optimal classiﬁcation function. In the previous
studies of drug—target prediction and disease-related miRNA-
EF prediction (Chen et a[., 2012a; Xia et a[., 2010), reliable per-
formance has been obtained based on simple average operation
for classiﬁer combination. Especially, it has been shown that
predictive accuracy of miREFScan in disease-related miRNA-
EF prediction is not sensitive to the selection of weight parameter
(Chen et a[., 2012a). Here, we assigned 0.1—0.9 to weight coefﬁ-
cients and calculated corresponding AUC values in the frame-
work of LOOCV (Supplementary Fig. S2). It has been observed
that predictive performance of LRLSLDA is not sensitive to
weight coefﬁcient selection. Also we can conclude that it is im-
proper to give too much weight to classiﬁer function in the
lncRNA space. It is not difﬁcult to understand this conclusion.
There were only 293 disease—lncRNA associations for 167 dis-
eases in the known golden standard dataset, i.e. less than two
associations per disease. When one association was left out as
test sample in the process of LOOCV, it is much likely that there
were no lncRNAs associated with this disease in the known
training samples. Therefore, only lncRNA similarity is not
enough and disease similarity must be introduced to make full
use of the information of similar diseases.

4.3 Compared with other methods

As mentioned above, there is no method to predict potential
lncRNA—disease associations in the previous studies. However,
there are some similar problems in other ﬁelds of computational
biology and many methods have been already developed to solve
these problems. Some of these methods can be applied to predict
lncRNA—disease associations. Taking into account the fact there
are less than two associations for each disease on average, it is
infeasible to implement LOOCV for a given disease, and
LOOCV must be implemented for all the diseases simultaneously
as we did before. Therefore, only global methods can be used in
LOOCV, which can prioritize candidate lncRNAs for all the
disease simultaneously, and compare the scores of different
lncRNA—disease pairs.

Hence, we compared LRLSLDA with three previous pub-
lished methods as follows in LOOCV based on the same dataset:
(i) RLS-kron (van Laarhoven et a[., 2011), combining different
kernels based on Kronecker product in the drug—target inter-
action prediction; (ii) hypergeometric distribution method
(Jiang et a[., 2010), predicting disease-related miRNAs based
on the hypergeometric distribution; (iii) network-consistency-
based inference (Chen and Zhang, 2013), inferring potential
disease—miRNA associations based on the idea of network con-
sistency. The comparison between LRLSLDA and three previ-
ous methods in the LOOCV was shown in Figure 4, which

previous state-of—the-art methods in LOOCV. It has been indicated that
LRLSLDA signiﬁcantly improved previous methods LOOCV by at least

signiﬁcantly improved the performance of previous method by at
least 0.1199 in the term of AUC values and fully demonstrated
the superiority performance of LRLSLDA.

4.4 LOOCV in the new validation framework

Recently, Park and Marcotte (2012) have pointed out that the
ﬂaw of evaluation procedure based on cross validation for the
pair-input computational prediction problems has affected a
number of previous studies. They have demonstrated that the
paired nature of inputs leads to a natural partitioning of test
pairs, and pair-input methods achieve signiﬁcantly different pre-
dictive performances for distinct test classes (Park and Marcotte,
2012). They further performed experiments for protein—protein
interactions prediction based on seven state-of—the-art methods
and observed that the performance of each method differs sig-
niﬁcantly in different test classes (Park and Marcotte, 2012).

According to the evaluation methods proposed in this article,
we classiﬁed test samples of lncRNA—disease associations into
four distinct classes: Cl is composed of the test samples sharing
both diseases and lncRNAs with the training samples; C2 is
composed of the test samples sharing only diseases with the
training samples; C3 is composed of the test samples sharing
only lncRNAs with the training samples; C4 is composed of
the test samples sharing neither diseases nor lncRNAs with the
training samples. To be honest, LRLSLDA strongly relies on the
topology structures in known disease—lncRNA association net-
work, so it can not be applied to predict test samples in C4. We
implemented LOOCV for the test samples in C1, C2 and C3,
respectively. The performance of LRLSLDA in these three
classes test samples have been shown in Figure 5 (AUC of
0.7880 in C1, 0.8071 in C2, 0.8736 in C3), which has illustrated
that LRLSLDA has a reliable predictive performance in different
test classes.

4.5 Case studies and novel lncRNA—disease association

Fig. 5. Here, we implemented LOOCV for the test samples in C1, C2 and
C3, respectively, and the performance have been shown, with AUC of
0.7880 in C1, 0.8071 in C2, 0.8736 in C3. Results indicate that LRLSLDA
has a reliable predictive performance in different test classes

disease—lncRNA associations in the gold standard dataset
were used as training samples. Predictive results were publicly
released to beneﬁt experimental validation from biologists
(Supplementary Table S3). It is anticipated that these potential
lncRNA—disease associations predicted by LRLSLDA could be
conﬁrmed by biological experiments.

Recent results in biological experiments conﬁrmed that
Alzheimer disease is related to gene RELN and its antisense
transcript HARlA and HARlB (Harries, 2012). These two
lncRNAs were both ranked in the top of predictive list for
Alzheimer disease (17th and 18th, respectively). Recently, Han
et al. (2012) conﬁrmed lincRNA TUGl is up-related in 44
patients with bladder cancer based on Real-Time qPCR. In the
potential bladder cancer—related lncRNAs list predicted by
LRLSLDA, TUGl was ranked 18th.

Aforementioned lncRNAs all have known related diseases in
the golden standard dataset. One of advantages of LRLSLDA is
that it can predict potential related diseases for lncRNA of inter-
est, even if it does not have any related diseases in the training
dataset. Flockhart et al. (2012) identiﬁed the potential functional
role of lncRNA BRAF-regulated lncRNA l (BANCR) in mel-
anoma cell migration. BANCR has not been associated with any
diseases in our golden dataset. We ranked all the candidate dis-
eases for BANCR. In the predictive results, melanoma is ranked
10th out of all the 167 candidate diseases.

As mentioned above, LRLSLDA is a global ranking approach
that can prioritize potential lncRNA—disease associations for all
the diseases simultaneously. Therefore, we further applied our
method to simultaneously rank all the candidate lncRNA—
disease associations. We also publicly released predictive results
in the Supplementary Table S4. In this global ranking, potential
association between lncRNA NEATl and breast cancer was
ranked fourth out of 19413 candidate associations. Recent
study by Redvers et al. (2012) conﬁrmed this potential associ-
ation. They implemented an integrated in viva genomics screen
and revealed signiﬁcant upregulation of NEATl in breast me-
tastasis tumors. This independent and high-ranking evidence

LRLSLDA for disease-related lncRNA prediction

 

further demonstrates the reliable performance of LRLSLDA and
gives a strong support to other predicted lncRNA—disease asso-
ciations (Supplementary Table S4).

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Disease—lncRNA association inference is important in the design
of speciﬁc molecular tools for human disease diagnosis, treat-
ment, prognosis and prevention. In this article, we proposed
the assumption that similar diseases tend to be associated
with functionally similar lncRNAs and further developed a
novel method of LRLSLDA in the framework of LapRLS.
LRLSLDA can effectively identify potential disease—lncRNA
associations on a large scale by integrating the information of
known disease—lncRNA associations and lncRNA expression
proﬁles. More importantly, LRLSLDA is a semisupervised
method that does not need the information of negative samples.
Also, it can prioritize lncRNA—disease pairs for all the diseases
simultaneously. The method has shown its reliable performance
in the term of LOOCV and signiﬁcantly improved previous
methods. According to the evaluation methods proposed in a
recent article, we further demonstrated LRLSLDA can work
effectively in the different test samples of lncRNA—disease asso-
ciations. Therefore, we publicly released plenty of potential
lncRNA—disease pairs for biological experiments validation,
and some of potential associations have been conﬁrmed by
recent results in biological experiments. As an effective and im-
portant biological tool, we anticipated LRLSLDA can beneﬁt
early diagnosis and treatment of diseases and improvement of
the human health in the future.

The reliable performance of LRLSLDA could be largely
attributed to the following several factors, which are also the
reasons for which we integrate LapRLS and Gaussian kernel
for potential disease-related lncRNA prediction. Firstly, known
disease—lncRNA associations and lncRNA expression proﬁles
could be integrated to capture the potential associations between
disease and lncRNA. Especially, this method can be used to
predict potential disease—lncRNA associations sharing only dis-
eases or lncRNAs with the known associations in training data-
set. Secondly, the classiﬁers from different spaces would be
combined and the predictive ability could be signiﬁcantly
improved in this way, which has been fully demonstrated from
the comparison between LRLSLDA and classiﬁer in the single
space in Figure 3. More importantly, as a semi-supervised
method, the advantage of LRLSLDA over supervised methods
has been shown in many previous studies. Especially, semisuper-
vised method could be implemented without any negative
disease—lncRNA associations, which are difﬁcult or even impos-
sible to obtain nowadays. Finally, as a global method,
LRLSLDA can predict the potential lncRNA—disease associ-
ations for all the diseases simultaneously. In conclusion,
LRLSLDA represents a novel, important and powerful tool in
biomedical research for disease treatment and drug discovery.

Some limitations also exist in the LRLSLDA. Firstly, many
parameters appear in our model and how to select the parameter
is not still solved well. Secondly, for the same lncRNA—disease
pair, two different scores from different spaces will be obtained.
How to directly obtain a single classiﬁer or reasonably integrate
these two classiﬁers would be an important problem for future

research. Thirdly, introducing more reliable measure of disease
similarity and lncRNA similarity and developing more reliable
similarity integration method would improve the performance of
LRLSLDA. Especially, disease similarity in this model totally
relies on known disease—lncRNA association. We would con-
struct new similarity measures that do not rely on topology struc-
tures in the known association network and hence we can predict
potential associations sharing neither diseases nor lncRNAs with
known associations. Finally, available experimentally veriﬁed
disease—lncRNA associations are still comparatively rare. The
performance of LRLSLDA would be further improved when
more known associations can be obtained.

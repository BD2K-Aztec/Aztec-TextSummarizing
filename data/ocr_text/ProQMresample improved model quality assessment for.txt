ABSTRACT

Summary: Model Quality Assessment Programs (MQAPs) are used to
predict the quality of modeled protein structures. These usually use
two approaches: methods using consensus of many alternative
models and methods requiring only a single model to do its prediction.
The consensus methods are useful to improve overall accuracy; how-
ever, they frequently fail to pick out the best possible model and
cannot be used to generate and score new structures. Single-model
methods, on the other hand, do not have these inherent shortcomings
and can be used to both sample new structures and improve existing
consensus methods. Here, we present ProQM-resample, a membrane
protein-speciﬁc single-model MQAP, that couples side-chain resam-
pling with MQAP rescoring by ProQM to improve model selection. The
side-chain resampling is able to improve side-chain packing for 96%
of all models, and improve model selection by 24% as measured by
the sum of the Z—score for the first-ranked model (from 25.0 to 31.1),
even better than the state-of—the-art consensus method Pcons. The
improved model selection can be attributed to the improved side-
chain quality, which enables the MQAP to rescue good backbone
models with poor side-chain packing.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein structure modeling represents a fundamental challenge in
structural bioinformatics and is crucial for a detailed understand-
ing of the structure and biological function of molecules. It can
be used to guide and explain experiments, as well as for predic-
tion of proteins whose structure, in particular for membrane
proteins, for the most part is unknown (~0.5% membrane pro-
tein in the Protein Data Bank ~25% in most genomes). A
common technique in structure modeling is to generate many
alternative models and use a Model Quality Assessment
Program (MQAP) to select the best model. Alternatively, an
MQAP can also be used to assess the absolute quality of a
single model, i.e. a measure that is related to similarity to true
native structure Wallner and Elofsson, 2003; Wang et al., 2009).

ProQM (Ray et al., 2010) is an MQAP that uses a support
vector machine to predict the quality of a membrane protein

model by combining structural and sequence-based features cal-
culated from the model. In its original implementation, external
programs were used to calculate features, e.g. PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997), PSIPRED (McGuffln et al., 2000),
Naccess (Hubbard and Thornton, 1993), Stride (Frishman and
Argos, 1995), Preres WVallner and Elofsson, 2006), Zpred
(Granseth et al., 2006), Topcons (Bernsel et al., 2009),
MPRAP (Illergard et al., 2010) and SVM-light (Joachims,
2002). These dependencies made it difficult to distribute the pro-
gram, run large batches and use it in conformational sampling.
Therefore, ProQM has only been available as a webserver for
small-scale use. To overcome these issues, ProQM was incorpo-
rated as scoring function in the Rosetta modeling framework.
This gives in one hand full access to the modeling machinery
within Rosetta and allows for easy integration with any
Rosetta protocol. In particular, ProQM-resample uses the
repack protocol to sample side-chain conformations followed
by rescoring using ProQM to improve model selection.

2 METHOD DEVELOPMENT

ProQM (Ray et al., 2010) was implemented as a scoring func-
tion in Rosetta (Das and Baker, 2008). ProQM uses two sets of
features, one that only depends on the model sequence and one
that is calculated from the structural model. The sequence-based
features only need to be calculated once for a given sequence
and are used as input to Rosetta. While all structural features
such as atom—atom contacts, residue—residue contacts, surface
areas and secondary structures, as well as the SVM prediction
are calculated by Rosetta during scoring, there is still a depend-
ency on external programs for the sequence-based features.
The programs and the scripts to prepare input ﬁles are provided
on the download page. There is also a server available at:
http://ProQSeq.wallnerlab.org/.

For the structural-based features, we adapted an already
existing implementation of Naccess (Hubbard and Thornton,
1993) and DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983) to calculate
exposed residue surface area and for assigning secondary struc-
ture, respectively. The atom—atom and residue—residue contact
matrices, previously calculated by Preres, were implemented
directly in Rosetta as well as the functionality to read and
predict SVM models. To account for changes in implementa-
tion details, the SVM model weights were retrained using the
original 5-fold cross-validated ProQM training set (Ray et al.,
2010).

2.1 ProQM resampling protocol

An advantage of implementing ProQM as a scoring function in
the Rosetta modeling framework is that it enables conform-
ational sampling using the MQAP as part of the scoring func-
tion. However, because an MQAP should measure the quality of
any input model it cannot make large change to the model and
claim it is assessing the quality of the input model. Therefore, we
decided to sample only the side-chain rotamers while keeping the
backbone ﬁxed, effectively keeping the quality measures based
on Ca coordinates such as TMscore (Zhang and Skolnick, 2004)
constant. This was achieved by rebuilding side-chains with a
backbone-dependent rotamer library implemented in the repack
protocol using the score_membrane scoring function (Barth et al.,
2007), followed by rescore using ProQM. Based on Figure 1
sampling and rescoring, 10 different model decoys for each initial
model seem to be a good choice.

2.2 Benchmark

ProQM-resample was benchmarked on the independent
EVfold_membrane data set (Hopf et al., 2012) consisting of
15340 models for 25 targets generated with CNS (Brunger
et al., 1998) using distance constraints from evolutionary cou-
plings extracted from large multiple sequence alignments (the set
is actually larger, but only 25 targets had a known structure).
Results were compared with Pcons (Larsson et al., 2009), a state-
of-the-art consensus method, and EVFOLD—MQAP (Hopf et al.,
2012), a predicted ranking based on satisfaction of unused con-
straints, predicted secondary structure and predicted lipid expos-
ure agreement. In the cases where the EVfold_membrane set
contained homologous proteins (BLAST E < 0.01) to the original
ProQM training set, ProQM was retrained with non-homolo-
gous proteins. Model selection accuracy was measured by
Z-scores calculated from TMscore.

3 RESULTS

First, the ProQM implementation in Rosetta was compared with
the original ProQM-webserver version. They should be similar,

Supplementary Information for exact definition of the sets.

but because of different implementations of Naccess and DSSP
versus STRIDE, and the ﬁxing of some minor hugs, the results
will not be identical. Still, there is a clear correlation, R = 0.98,
between ProQM-Rosetta and ProQM-webserver and the predic-
tion performance is also maintained, R=0.62 to true answer
(data not shown).

The benchmark on the EVfold_membrane set showed that
model selection is signiﬁcantly improved by resampling the
side-chains (Fig 1). Already without any sampling ProQM selects
slightly better models than EVFOLD—MQAP (Z:25.0 versus
24.4). Side-chain sampling increases the performance signiﬁ-
cantly to Z 231.1 and levels out at around 10 resamples per
model, surpassing even the state-of-the-art consensus Pcons.
This demonstrates the usefulness of single-model MQAPs in
model selection. It also highlights the need to include side-
chain sampling into the MQAP procedure to avoid losing
good backbone models suffering from poor side-chain packing.
A possible reason for the improved selection is the fact that
almost all models (96%) improved the side-chain packing after
resampling (Supplementary Fig. S1). Before resampling, the side-
chain quality is roughly the same for all targets (Table 1). But
after resampling the side-chain improvement is larger for the set
of targets that also show backbone improvement after resam-
pling compared with targets that show no improvement in back-
bone, indicating that improved side-chains help the MQAP to
select better backbone models.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Molecular representation for small molecules has been
routinely used in QSAR/SAR, virtual screening, database search, rank-
ing, drug ADME/T prediction and other drug discovery processes. To
facilitate extensive studies of drug molecules, we developed a freely
available, open-source python package called chemoinformatics in
python (ChemoPy) for calculating the commonly used structural and
physicochemical features. It computes 16 dmg feature groups com-
posed of 19 descriptors that include 1135 descriptor values. In add-
ition, it provides seven types of molecular fingerprint systems for drug
molecules, including topological fingerprints, electro-topological state
(E—state) fingerprints, MACCS keys, FP4 keys, atom pairs fingerprints,
topological torsion fingerprints and Morgan/circular fingerprints. By
applying a semi-empirical quantum chemistry program MOPAC,
ChemoPy can also compute a large number of 3D molecular descrip-
tors conveniently.

Availability: The python package, ChemoPy, is freely available via
http://code.goog|e.com/p/pychem/downloads/list, and it runs on
Linux and MS-Windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular features for small molecules have frequently been used
in the development of machine learning in QSAR/QSPR, virtual
screening, database search, similarity search, ranking, drug
ADME/T prediction and other drug discovery processes (Cao
et al., 2010, 2011, 2012a, b; Dea-Ayuela et al., 2008; Du et al.,
2005, 2008a, b, 2009; Gola et al., 2006, Gonzalez-Diaz et al.,
2005; Prado-Prado et al., 2008, 2009, 2010; van de
Waterbeemd et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2009;
Yan et al., 2012; Zhu et al., 2011). These descriptors capture
and magnify distinct aspects of molecular topology to investigate
how molecular structure affects molecular property. Currently,
these features were widely used to characterize ligand molecules
in the protein—ligand network and predict new protein—ligand
associations to identify potential drug targets (Campillos et al.,

2008; Cao et al., 2012a, b; Chou et al., 2006; Izrailev et al., 2004;
Keiser et al., 2007; Prado-Prado et al., 2011a, b; Viﬁa et al.,
2009), following the spirit of chemogenomics.

Several programs for computing molecular descriptors have
been developed, such as MARCH-INSIDE, TOPS-MODE,
TOMO-COMD, Dragon, CODESSA, Molconn—Z (http://www.
edusoft-lc.com/molconn/), Chemistry Development Kit (CDK),
Indigo (http://ggasoftware.com/opensource/indigo), JOELib,
RDKit (http://www.rdkit.org/) and Avogadro (Gonzalez-Diaz
et al., 2008; Hanwell et al., 2012; Katritzky et al., 1994;
Marrero-Ponce et al., 2002; Perez-Gonzalez et al., 2003;
Steinbeck et al., 2003; Todeschini et al., 2010; Wegner, 2005).
Unfortunately, some of these tools are not comprehensive, or
are limited to only a certain kind of features. Additionally,
some are not freely and easily accessible.

We implemented a selection of sophisticated molecular features
and provided them as a package for the free and open-source
software environment python. The ChemoPy package aims at
providing the user with comprehensive implementations of these
descriptors in a uniﬁed framework to allow easy and transparent
computation. To our knowledge, ChemoPy is the ﬁrst open-
source package computing a large number of molecular features
based on the MOPAC optimization. We recommend ChemoPy to
analyse and represent the drugs or ligand molecules under inves-
tigation. Further, we hope that the package will be helpful when
exploring questions concerning drug activity, drug ADME/T and
drug—target interactions in the context of computational biology.
After accomplishing the previous goal, we expect that our/other
groups may use the free code of ChemoPy and the new QSAR
models to implement public web servers, such as MIND-BEST
(Gonzalez-Diaz et al., 2011). The users can run predictions of
libraries of compounds using SMILES codes as input.

2 CHEMOPY FEATURES

The ChemoPy package contains several functions and modules
manipulating drug molecules. To obtain molecular structures
easily, ChemoPy provides a download module, by which the
user could easily get molecular structures from four databases
(i.e. KEGG, PubChem, DrugBank and CAS) by providing IDs.

>>> from pychem.pychem import getmol
>>> smil = getmol.GetMolFromNCBI(‘2244’)

>>> print smil

CC(Oclccccch(O)=O)=O

>>> smi2 = getmol.GetMolFromKegg(‘D00109’)
>>> print smi2

CC(Oclccccch(O)=O)=O

ChemoPy can compute a large number of 2D and 3D descrip-
tors. A list of structural and physicochemical features covered by
ChemoPy is summarized in Table 1 (see also detailed descriptor
list in Supplementary Material S1). There are two means to com-
pute these molecular descriptors from small molecules. One is to
use the built-in modules. There exist 19 modules responding to
the calculation of descriptors from 16 feature groups. The in-
struction for each module is provided in the form of HTML in
ChemoPy (see Supplementary Material S2). We could import
related functions to compute these features. For example, the
topology module includes a number of functionalities used for
calculating various topological descriptors. The user could con-
veniently use them as need.

>>> from pychem.pychem import Chem, topology
>>> mol 2 Chem.MolFromSmiles("CC(OclccccclC(O)=O)=O”)
>>> Weiner = topology.CalculateWeiner(mol)

>>> Alltopology = topology.GetTopology(mol)

aSome of these features are from RDKit.
bThese features are from RDKit.
0These features are from OpenBabel.

The other is to call the PyChem2d or PyChem3d class by im-
porting the pychem module, which encapsulates commonly used
descriptor calculation methods. PyChem2d and PyChem3d are
responsible for the calculation of 2D and 3D molecular descrip-
tors, respectively. We could construct a PyChem2d or
PyChem3d object with a molecule input and then call corres-
ponding methods to calculate these features.

>>> from pychem.pychem import PyChem2d, PyChem3d
>>> desl = PyChem2d()

>>> desl .ReadMolFromSmile(“CC(OcICCCCCIC(O)=O)=O”)
>>> AllConnectivity = des1.GetConnectivity()

>>> des2 = PyChem3d()

>>> des2.ReadMol(“CC(OclccccclC(O)=O)=O”)

>>> All3D = des2.GetAllDescriptor()

In ChemoPy, molecular structures are optimized by the AMI
method in MOPAC. MOPAC input ﬁle is directly prepared by
Pybel and OpenBabel. The detailed introductions for all descrip-
tors are provided in the ChemoPy manual (see Supplementary
Material S3). A user guide for the use of ChemoPy is included to
guide how the user uses it to calculate the needed features (see
Supplementary Material S4).

ChemoPy is written by the pure python language. We chose
to use python because it is open source, and there already exist
packages to handle small molecules [e.g. Pybel (O’Boyle et al.,
2008b), PyMol and Cinfony (O’Boyle et al., 2008a)]. It is con-
venient for ChemoPy to analyse drug molecules processed
by Cinfony or RDKit. ChemoPy is available for two operating
systems: Linux and Windows. ChemoPy depends on Pybel,
RDKit, OpenBabel (O’Boyle et al., 2011) and MOPAC
(Stewart, 1990). Moreover, it needs the support of scientiﬁc
library for python (SciPy).

3 DISCUSSION

ChemoPy contains a selection of molecular descriptors to
analyse, classify and compare complex molecular network.
They facilitate to exploit machine-learning techniques to drive
hypothesis from complex molecular datasets. The usefulness of
these molecular descriptors covered by ChemoPy for represent-
ing structural features of small molecules has been sufﬁ-
ciently demonstrated by a number of published studies of the
development of machine-learning classiﬁcation systems. The
ChemoPy implementation of each of these algorithms was
extensively tested by using a number of test molecules. The com-
puted descriptor values were compared with the known
values for these molecules to ensure that our computation is
accurate.

Owing to the modular structure of ChemoPy, extensions or
new functionalities can be implemented easily without complex
and time-consuming alterations of the source code. In future
work, we plan to apply the integrated features on various biolo-
gical research questions, and extending the range of functions
with new promising descriptors for the coming versions of
ChemoPy.

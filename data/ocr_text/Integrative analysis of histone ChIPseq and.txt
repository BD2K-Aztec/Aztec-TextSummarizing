ABSTRACT

Motivation: Histone modifications are a key epigenetic mechanism to
activate or repress the transcription of genes. Datasets of matched
transcription data and histone modification data obtained by ChlP-seq
exist, but methods for integrative analysis of both data types are still
rare. Here, we present a novel bioinformatics approach to detect
genes that show different transcript abundances between two condi-
tions putatively caused by alterations in histone modification.
Results: We introduce a correlation measure for integrative analysis of
ChlP-seq and gene transcription data measured by RNA sequencing
or microarrays and demonstrate that a proper normalization of ChIP-
seq data is crucial. We suggest applying Bayesian mixture models of
different types of distributions to further study the distribution of the
correlation measure. The implicit classification of the mixture models is
used to detect genes with differences between two conditions in both
gene transcription and histone modification. The method is applied to
different datasets, and its superiority to a naive separate analysis of
both data types is demonstrated.

1 INTRODUCTION

Modiﬁcations of histone proteins are an epigenetic mechanism to
regulate gene transcription and are fundamental to stem cell dif-
ferentiation as well as to the genesis of cancer (Baylin and Jones,
2011; Dawson and Kouzarides, 2012). Histone modiﬁcations can
be localized genome wide using chromatin immunoprecipitation
followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) (Furey, 2012; Park, 2009).
Recently, several studies used this technique to explore the role
of different chromatin states in transcriptional regulation (Cheng

et al., 2011; Dong et al., 2012; Ernst and Kellis, 2010). In cancer
research, it is often of interest to detect differences in histone
modiﬁcations between two conditions, e.g. between cancer and
normal cells or between cells carrying a mutation of an epigenetic
regulator and wild-type cells. The main focus is usually on epi-
genetic modiﬁcations that occur together with a change in gene
transcription, as these modiﬁcations are more likely to contribute
to the phenotype or cancer development. Hence, in addition to
histone ChIP—seq, many studies measure genome-wide RNA
abundances from the same samples using expression microarrays
or RNA sequencing (RNA-seq). The identiﬁcation of genes
showing differences in both histone modiﬁcation and gene tran-
scription data is crucial not only due to their potential causative
role in cancer but also for identifying putative therapeutic targets
for epigenetic drugs. Before presenting our integrative analysis
approach to detect such genes using a Bayesian mixture model,
we brieﬂy review existing methods for data preprocessing and
recent applications of mixture models to integrate genomic data.

Before matching both data types, an appropriate preprocess-
ing is necessary to obtain standardized ChIP—seq and transcrip-
tion values. Although normalization methods for transcription
data, especially expression microarray data, are well established,
rigorous preprocessing methods for ChIP-seq data are still an
active ﬁeld of research. When comparing two or more ChIP-
seq samples, differences in immunoprecipitation efﬁciency and
in sequencing depth should be accounted for. Many recent meth-
ods focus on the estimation of the proportion of background
reads and require control samples either derived from input
DNA or from ChIP against an unspeciﬁc antibody (Diaz
et al., 2012; Enroth et al., 2012; Liang and Keles, 2012; Nair
et al., 2012). Other methods, especially for comparative analysis,
do not rely on control samples; for example, Xu et a]. (2008)
proposed dividing read counts by the total number of reads and
thereby account for different sequencing depths. Taslim et a].
(2009) suggested a non-linear normalization based on local re-
gression. A related regression-based approach has recently been
suggested by Shao et a]. (2012). Song and Smith (2011) and Bao
et a]. (2013) presented models for detecting regions with differ-
ences in histone modiﬁcations that inherently account for
sequencing depth or ChIP efﬁciency. Some methods originally
designed for normalizing RNA-seq data may also be adequate

Integration of ChIP-seq and transcription data

 

(Dillies et al., 2012), especially when ChIP—seq data are restricted
to genomic regions like genes.

Mixture models have been used in many ways to cluster or
classify genes. Recent applications include integrative analyses of
various data types (Kirk et al., 2012), including gene transcrip-
tion together with either DNA copy number (van Wieringen and
van de Wiel, 2009), DNA methylation (Kormaksson et al., 2012)
or transcription factor binding activity (Liu et al., 2007; Savage
et al., 2010), as well as assessing concordance between ChIP-chip
and ChIP-seq platforms (Schafer et al., 2012). Models may con-
sider a ﬁxed number of components or allow for a ﬂexible and
even inﬁnite number of components. The standard techniques
for ﬁtting such mixture models are EM algorithms in frequentist
statistics (McLachlan et al., 2006; Newton et al., 2004; Taslim
et al., 2009; van Wieringen and van de Wiel, 2009) and Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms for Bayesian mixture
models implying a prior distribution on the mixture (Kirk et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2007; Savage et al., 2010; Schafer et al., 2012).
Input measures for mixture models are case-speciﬁc, such as dif-
ferent log-ratio intensity measurements or transformed P—values.

In traditional clustering using mixture models, each cluster is
represented by one Gaussian component. The number of clusters
is determined by an external criterion or, especially in a Bayesian
context, estimated within the model (Friihwirth—Schnatter, 2006).
However, often clusters are poorly ﬁtted by a single component;
as a remedy, models involving a mixture of mixtures have
been introduced in which each cluster is represented by a mixture
itself (see Baudry et al., 2010; Rousseau and Mengersen, 2011,
for frequentist and Bayesian approaches, respectively). In this
work, we present a model involving a mixture of mixtures that
circumvents overﬁtting and identiﬁability problems both by con-
sidering a ﬁxed number of clusters suggested by the biological
task and by ﬁtting a ﬁxed number of components corresponding
to different types of distributions. The latter reduces the number
of necessary mixture components and is beneﬁcial for interpret-
ation. Although a similar approach has been applied on ChIP-
seq data by Taslim et al. (2009), our innovation lies in using a
Bayesian framework that compared with the Expectation-
Maximization (EM) algorithm holds several beneﬁts, such as
the possibility of assessing the uncertainty through credible inter-
vals and less dependence on initial values. Furthermore, we apply
our model on data obtained from integrating gene transcription
and ChIP—seq datasets. We demonstrate the advantages of our
method over the EM approach and over a separate analysis of
both datasets on simulated data as well as on actual biological
data.

In Section 2, we ﬁrst describe our data matching and integra-
tion approach and subsequently present our Bayesian mixture
model. Section 3 gives a description of results obtained on two
different datasets and a simulation study. A discussion follows in
Section 4 and ﬁnal conclusions in Section 5.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

The ﬁrst dataset was derived from hematopoietic stem and progenitor

cells (Lineage, Sea-1+, c-Kit+) from Cebpaﬂ/fl mice (hereafter termed

wild-type mice) and Cebpaﬂ/ﬂ; MxI Cre mice conditionally deleted for

Cebpa (hereafter termed knockout mice). Specimens from three Cebpa
knockout mice and three wild-type mice were hybridized separately on six
Affymetrix Mouse Gene 1.0 ST arrays. Transcription data were normal-
ized using the robust multi-array average algorithm (RMA, Irizarry et al.,
2003) (Gene Expression Omnibus GSE49975). ChIP against histone H3
lysine K4 trimethylation (H3K4me3) was applied to two pools of three
wild-type mice and two pools of three knockout mice each. After ChIP,
specimens were sequenced on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx sequen-
cer producing 36-bp reads (GSE43007). The Burrows—Wheeler aligner (Li
and Durbin, 2009) was applied to map the reads against the reference
genome (mmlO).

The second dataset was taken from a study (Bert et al., 2013) where
epigenetic differences between a prostate cancer cell line (LNCaP) and
normal primary prostate cells (PrEC) were studied. RNA-seq was carried
out on an Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx to measure RNA transcription
in LNCaP and PrEC cells. The STAR algorithm (Dobin et al., 2013) was
used to align reads (76 bp, single end) against the human reference
genome (hgl9) annotated with splice junctions obtained from the
GENCODE project (Harrow et al., 2012) to improve alignment accuracy.
H3K4me3 and histone H3 lysine K27 trimethylation (H3K27me3) were
localized in the LNCaP and PReC cells by ChIP-seq (Illumina HiSeq
2000 and Illumina Genome Analyzer IIx resp., 50 bp reads). ChIP-seq
reads were aligned against the human reference genome (hgl9) using the
Burrows—Wheeler aligner (Li and Durbin, 2009). The dataset can be
downloaded at Gene Expression Omnibus (GSE38685).

A third dataset was taken from a study (Schenk et al., 2012) comparing
the effect of all-trans-retinoic acid (ATRA) treatment with the effect of a
combined treatment of ATRA and tranylcypromine (TCP) on a leukemic
cell line. Details of the dataset and analysis results are given in the
Supplementary Material.

A simulation dataset was generated based on the ﬁrst two knockout
mice replicates from the Cebpa dataset. We assumed that all genes were
neither differential in gene transcription nor in histone modiﬁcation be-
tween the two biological replicates. Differential genes were then simulated
by multiplying the transcription value and the ChIP-seq value (calculated
as described in Section 2.2) of the ﬁrst replicate by (l + c) with
c e {—l, —0.9..., —0.l,0.l, ...,l}. The 100 genes with a ChIP-seq
value above the median of all ChIP-seq values were randomly chosen
for each level of factor c leading to 2000 of 21236 genes with equally
directed differences in both data types.

2.2 Data matching and normalization

Data matching is performed at transcript level. The basic idea is to obtain
a measure for the abundance of a transcript or group of transcripts from
either RNA-seq data or microarray data and then to allocate a ChIP-seq
value based on the number of ChIP-seq reads aligned within the genomic
region of that transcript. Here, we focus on genomic regions centered at
the transcripts’ transcriptional start sites (TSSs), as the histone modiﬁca-
tions studied here primarily occur at TSSs, with H3K27me3 occurring
additionally throughout gene bodies (Dong et al., 2012).

2.2.] RNA-seq data After alignment of RNA-seq reads to the
genome by software capable of producing spliced alignments, transcript
abundance is estimated using the Cufﬂinks algorithm (Trapnell et al.,
2010). Abundances are reported in fragments per kilobase of transcript
per million fragments mapped (FPKM) and are scaled via the ratio of the
sample’s 0.75 quartile to the average 0.75 quartile value across all samples
as implemented in the Cuffdiff software (Trapnell et al., 2013).
Transcripts sharing the same TSS are grouped and their FPKM values
are summarized to obtain a single FPKM value for each TSS. Finally,
FPKM values are logarithmized. In the following, in case of RNA-seq
data, X ,- and A,- denote the normalized FPKM values of the two condi-
tions/treatments of interest (e.g. cancer and normal cells) for all tran-
scripts sharing TSS i: l, ...,n.

2.2.2 Gene expression microarray data In contrast to RNA-seq or
ChIP-seq, gene expression microarray data consist of continuous meas-
urement values that can be directly assigned to transcripts based on the
given array design. Several normalization methods for various array plat-
forms exist. We chose RMA (Irizarry et al., 2003) for Affymetrix
GeneChips arrays and variance-stabilizing transformation (Lin et al.,
2008) for Illumina Bead Chips. Both methods apply a logarithmic or
similar transformation on the transcription values. A drawback of the
array technology is that, depending on the array design, an array probe
may measure several transcripts and that these transcripts may have dif-
ferent TSSs. In case of array data, X, and A, denote the normalized
transcription values of the two conditions/treatments of interest for all
transcripts measured by probe 1' = l, ..., n.

2.2.3 ChIP-seq data ChIP-seq values are calculated for a given TSS i
by counting the number of sequenced fragments lying within the genomic
region R, of width w centered at the TSS. Let Y, and B, denote the
number of reads overlapping R, in the two conditions. Reads are ex-
panded toward the 3’ -end to the mean DNA fragment length (here
200 bp or 350 bp) before calculating Y, and B,. The size w of R, must
be chosen depending on the studied histone modiﬁcation. For many his-
tone modiﬁcations, an appropriate size is known (Hebenstreit et al.,
2011), and we show that the choice of w is not crucial for our approach.
Alternatively, a proper choice of R, can be obtained from a peak detec-
tion algorithm applied to the ChIP-seq data. In case of RNA-seq data, X,
and A, can be directly matched to Y, and B,. However, array probes may
be located at exons associated with more than one transcript, which may
have different TSSs. In such cases, we deﬁne R, as the union of the
regions derived for all single transcripts measured by probe 1'. So R,
may consist of more than one genomic interval, and its size may differ
for different probes.

To account for different total number of reads and different ChIP
efﬁciency, quantile normalization (Bolstad et al., 2003) is applied to
the ChIP-seq values. The ChIP-seq values are ordered, so that
Y,1 5  5 Y,” and B,1 5  5 Br”. The normalized values are then
deﬁned as Y,, = 3,, :2 (Y,l. + B,,)/2.

2.2.4 Data integration After data normalization and matching, a
correlation value Z inspired by the externally centered correlation coef-
ﬁcient (Schafer et al., 2009, 2012) is calculated by multiplying the stan-
dardized difference of transcription values with the standardized
difference of ChIP-seq values:
azﬂﬂ, i=l,...,n (1)
UXA 0 YB
The variances of the differences 03M 2 1/(n — 1):;1 (X, — A,)2 and
0%,; = 1/(n — 1) EL, (Y, — B,)2 are calculated across all transcripts. If
a transcript shows equally directed differences in transcription and his-
tone modiﬁcation data, the corresponding Z value is positive, whereas it
is negative in case of unequally directed differences. If a transcript has
differences in only one of both data types or has no differences at all, Z is
expected to be close to zero. Thus, for an activating histone modiﬁcation,
the distribution of Z is expected to be slanted toward positive values.
If biological replicates are available, the average is calculated after
matching and normalization and then used in Equation (1), i.e.
Y, = l/m 1 Y,J- if m ChIP-seq replicates are available and YU- is the
quantile normalized ChIP-seq value of the j—th replicate for transcript i.

2.3 Bayesian mixture model

In the following, the distribution of Z will be studied to detect transcripts
with alterations and to explore the association between histone modiﬁ-
cation and transcript levels. As motivated in the previous section, we view
the distribution of Z as consisting of three clusters: A large probability
mass centered around zero corresponding to transcripts displaying

differences between the two conditions/treatments of interest in none or
just one of both data types, a smaller probability mass on the positive axis
corresponding to transcripts displaying equally directed differences be-
tween the two conditions in transcription and histone modiﬁcation data
and an also smaller probability mass on the negative axis corresponding
to transcripts displaying unequally directed differences between the two
conditions in both data types. Measure Equation (1) aggregates the in-
formation necessary to distinguish between these three clusters of tran-
scripts. The difﬁculty lies in discriminating Z values whose deviation from
zero is small enough to be explained by random variability from those
values that represent transcripts displaying (either equally or unequally
directed) differences between the two investigated conditions in both tran-
scription and histone modiﬁcation data.

A classic approach to analyze the distribution of Z that reﬂects this
conception would be a three-component mixture model, i.e. a model in
which each cluster is represented by one component. However, a cluster
may be represented by more than one component in a mixture model
when convenient for achieving a good ﬁt and classiﬁcation. In an inves-
tigation of an histone modiﬁcation via ChIP-chip and ChIP-seq meas-
urements (Schafer et al., 2012), a measure similar to Equation (1) was
used in a mixture model with eight Gaussian components representing
three clusters, concluding that less components, whereas preferable for
interpretation, do not provide enough ﬂexibility to ﬁt the histogram of
the Z values. Here, we want to propose a more general modeling ap-
proach that potentially reduces the number of necessary mixture compo-
nents for analyzing three clusters, e. g. when considerable probability mass
in the tails of the distribution constitute a challenge to standard models.

We take up the idea of Taslim et al. (2009) to ﬁt a mixture of not only
normal distributions, as in traditional model-based clustering, but also
both normal and exponential distributions. Although a number of
normal components represent the center of the distribution, the probabil-
ity mass in the distributions’ tails is covered by two exponential distribu-
tions, one of which is mirrored at zero. By using the exponential
distributions, the number of components can be considerably reduced,
as each exponential component potentially replaces several normal com-
ponents. In determining the number of normal components representing
the center of the distribution, besides the ﬁt, one criterion is to achieve a
clean classiﬁcation in the sense that the resulting classiﬁcation should
produce three contiguous domains of values.

2.3.] Model Formally, Z is assumed to be a random variable and
Z1, ...,Zn to be an independent and identically distributed random
sample of Z. The mixture model for the distribution F of Z with density
f is deﬁned as follows:

Zil)‘: M9 02 N  M9 02)

f(Zi|)»,M,02) = 7T1 -h(—Zi|)»1)
K—1
+ Zak -g(Zl-liik,0§)
k=2
+7TK-l/l(Z,'|AK), i=1,...,l’l

with mixture proportions JTk,k=1,...,K and 2,152,711, =1. The g
denotes the density of the normal and h the density of the exponential
distribution. Inverse gamma distributions are assigned to the variances of
the normal distributions, 02, k = 2, .. . , K — 1, whereas gamma distribu-
tions are assumed for the parameters A, and AK of the two exponential
distributions:

l/oli ~ Gamma(agk,bgk) for k = 2, ...,K—1
2,, ~ Gamma(aAk,bAk) for k = 1,K
These are the respective conjugate prior distributions and thus allow the

application of a Gibbs sampler. The classiﬁcation of transcripts is carried
out by means of an allocation variable T that is given a categorical

distribution. Correspondingly, T1, ..., T n are the classiﬁcations for all tran-
scripts i= 1, ..., n. The mixture proportions are following a Dirichlet
distribution,
T-~Cate oricalar , ...,JT
1 g ( 1 K) 

an, ...,JTK ~ Dirichlet(a/K, ...,a/K)

The use of the prior in Equation (2) generally favors a low number of
non-empty components, which we prefer for the sake of interpretability
(Friihwirth—Schnatter, 2011). Because the assignment of transcripts to the
components depends essentially on the mass parameter or, we estimate it
as part of the model instead of choosing a ﬁxed value. Thus, we also
assign a distribution to or (Ishwaran and Zarepour, 2000),

or ~ Gamma(ao,, bu).

The model is ﬁtted via MCMC methods using a Gibbs sampler
(Ishwaran and James, 2001; Neal, 2000, for details of our implementation
see Supplementary Material), and model estimates are obtained by aver-
aging across the posterior distributions. This mixture model is closely
related to Dirichlet process models in which the potentially inﬁnite
number of components is approximated by an effective ﬁnite mixture
model with an upper bound on the non-empty components (Ishwaran
and James, 2001; Ishwaran and Zarepour, 2000, one application being
Kirk et al., 2012). Depending on the application, the upper bound is
usually large, e.g. on the order of several hundreds. In contrast, we
prefer a small number of components for the sake of classiﬁcation and
easy interpretation while still achieving three contiguous classes as well as
a good ﬁt by non-standard mixing of different distributions. We found in
preliminary analyses that four normal components were sufﬁcient to
achieve a good overall ﬁt.

2.3.2 Prior distributions The normal components represent the Z
values equal to or near zero and are thus given a ﬁxed mean u, = 0
and a small variance a priori. The parameter of the exponential compo-
nents is assigned a small value a priori, resulting in a large mean,
which ensures that they represent the tails of the distribution while
avoiding label switching between the components that correspond to
distinct clusters. Speciﬁcally, we choose agk,0 = by,“0 = 10 for
k=2, ...,K— 1, an, 217,,“0 20.001 for k=1,K and a0,0 =00,0 =1
as prior values.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Cebpa knockout dataset

Normalized transcription values were averaged across the three
wild-type and three knockout samples for each probe annotated
with at least one transcript. This resulted in i: 1, ...,21236
transcription values X, and A, for both conditions. In all, 7163
probes were assigned to multiple transcripts with different TSSs
according to the ENSEMBL data base (Flicek et al., 2013).
ChIP-seq values Y, and B, were calculated by counting the
number of reads overlapping the promoter regions R,. Based
on work by Hebenstreit et al. (2011) and on visual inspection
of the read distribution at TSSs, we chose a promoter width of
w = 6000. After quantile normalization, ChIP-seq values were
averaged across the two knockout and wild-type replicates. To
assess the effect of different choices of w, we calculated the
Pearson correlation ,0 between X, — A, and Y, — B, for different
choices of w ranging from 100 to 20 000 bp (Fig. 1A). The choice
of w seems not to be crucial, unless it is chosen too small.
Furthermore, the correlation for probes with a unique TSS
(,0 = 0.200) does not differ remarkably from probes with

Fig. 1. Quantile normalization of ChIP-seq values. Figure (A) shows the
Pearson correlation between differences in gene transcription and differ-
ences in ChIP-seq values for different promoter sizes (x—axes) and differ-
ent ChIP-seq normalization approaches. The black vertical line indicates
the promoter width of w = 6000 chosen for this dataset. Quantile nor-
malization performed superior compared with linear scaling based on the
total number of reads as used by many peak detection algorithms,
e.g. MACS (Zhang et al., 2008), or compared with scaling based on the
median of count ratios as proposed by Anders and Huber (2010) for
RNA-seq data (see Supplementary Data for details on the different nor-
malization methods). Scatter plot (B) between the number of reads
observed within the promoters (w = 6000) in the ﬁrst and the second
Cebpa knockout replicate sample clearly shows need for normalization.
Figure (C) shows the scatterplot after quantile normalization

multiple TSSs (,0 = 0.203), indicating that the aggregation of
reads from multiple TSSs is suitable.

Figure 1A also shows that quantile normalization of the ChIP-
seq data leads to a higher correlation between the differences in
the transcription data and the differences in the ChIP-seq data
than the other studied normalization methods. A scatter plot
between the ChIP-seq values of the two Cebpa knockout repli-
cates (Fig. 1B) shows larger read counts in the promoter regions
for replicate 1, although replicate 2 had more mapped reads in
total (Supplementary Table S1) indicating different ChIP efﬁ-
ciency between both replicates. Figure 1C shows the ChIP-seq
values after quantile normalization.

After normalization, Z values were calculated and the model
from Section 2.3.1 was ﬁtted to the data. Figure 2A and B show
the model ﬁt and Figure 2C the classiﬁcations obtained from
100 000 iterations using every 10th iteration after a burn in of
2000 iterations. Parameter estimations are given in Table 1 and
corresponding trace plots in Supplementary Figure S1.
Classiﬁcations were obtained by calculating the mode of T,
across iterations. The distribution of Z had more probability
mass at the right tail than at the left tail, as reﬂected by the
estimated weights  of the mixture components. The weight of
the negative component 7%, = 0.002 was negligible, whereas
:26 = 0.039 was estimated for the positive component’s weight.

N ote: The 95% credibility intervals are given in square brackets. The curly brackets summarize the weights :1, or, respectively, the number of classiﬁed

transcripts for all four null components.

Only 27 transcripts were classiﬁed to the negative component,
20 751 to the null components and 458 to the positive component
(Supplementary Spreadsheet Sl). Hence, the majority of tran-
scripts did not show differences in both data types. However,
transcripts with differences in both data types clearly revealed
that an increase (decrease) in H3K4me3 is associated with an
increase (decrease) in gene transcription. Among the 458 tran-
scripts in the positive cluster, we found several genes that have
previously been implicated in hematopoietic stem cell biology
(Mecom, Kit) and/or acute myeloid leukemia (HoxaQ, MeisI),
highlighting the functions of Cebpa in normal and malignant
hematopoiesis. Moreover, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and
Genomes (KEGG) pathway analyses (Dennis et al., 2003)

identiﬁed acute myeloid leukemia as signiﬁcantly enriched
(False discovery rate (FDR) <0.05).

To study the reproducibility of the results, the dataset was split
into two datasets each consisting of one microarray and one
ChIP-seq sample from the knockout and wild-type collective,
respectively. Thus, each dataset consists of a single biological
replicate. The model ﬁts and classiﬁcation results obtained by
applying the model to each set of replicates separately are shown
in Figure 3. The contingency table (Table 2) of the classiﬁcation
results shows that fewer transcripts were classiﬁed to the positive
component in each of the two separate analyses compared with
the analysis of the full dataset. This may be due to smaller vari-
ances 012m and 0%,; in the full dataset caused by averaging the

replicates. Furthermore, only one transcript was classiﬁed to the
negative component in both analyses, whereas 104 transcripts
were classiﬁed to the positive component twice.

The speciﬁcity of our approach was assessed by comparing the
ﬁrst Cebpa knockout replicate to the second knockout replicate.
In this setup, no biological differences exist and all transcripts
should be classiﬁed to the null components. We observed small
weights 7%, = 0.001 and 726 = 0.004 of the two exponential com-
ponents (Fig. 3C). Only 11 (18) of 21236 transcripts were as-
signed to the negative (positive) component (Fig. 3F). On the
whole, these ﬁndings speak in favor of reproducibility of the
presented results.

3.2 Prostate cancer dataset

Normalized transcription values of LNCaP and PrEC cells were
calculated for 113 663 (groups of) transcripts that share the same
TSS based on transcript annotation from the GENCODE pro-
ject (Harrow et al., 2012). In all, 46 657 of these showed tran-
script abundances in LNCaP or PrEC and were used for model
ﬁtting and classiﬁcation. For both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3
histone modiﬁcations, a promoter width of w = 3 000 was
chosen. We chose a smaller promoter size than for the Cebpa

knockout dataset on the basis of the observed correlation be-
tween differences in ChIP-seq values and transcription values
for different choices of w (Supplementary Fig. S2) and due to
the fact that RNA-seq allows to distinguish between different
transcripts of the same gene that may have their TSSs in prox-
imity. The observed correlation of ,0 = 0.289 for H3K4me3 was
higher than in the Cebpa knockout dataset, indicating larger
differences or a larger fraction of genes showing epigenetic and
transcriptional differences when comparing prostate cancer cells
with normal cells. Interestingly, although it is known that
H3K27me3 occurs at the TSS but also throughout the gene
body (Ernst and Kellis, 2010; Hebenstreit et al., 2011), a larger
window width w covering larger parts of the gene body did not
lead to a stronger negative correlation (Supplementary Fig. S2b).
Recently, Dong et al. (2012) also chose windows close to the TSS
to predict transcription based on the occurrence of H3K27me3.
We observed ,0 = —0.l97 for H3K27me3, and for both histone
modiﬁcations, quantile normalization performed superior in
terms of maximizing the absolute correlation (Supplementary
Fig. S2), albeit the need for normalization was not as evident
as in the Cebpa knockout dataset.

Applying our Bayesian mixture model to the integrated tran-
scription and H3K4me3 data lead to 3526 transcripts classiﬁed
to the positive and 272 transcripts classiﬁed to the negative
component (Supplementary Spreadsheet S2). Consistently, we
observed a small weight of 7%, = 0.007 for the negative compo-
nent compared with the weight of the positive component
:26 = 0.107 (Supplementary Fig. S3A—C and Supplementary
Table S4). Focal adhesion, axon guidance and pathways in
cancer were signiﬁcantly (FDR <0.05) enriched KEGG path-
ways (Dennis et al., 2003). Axon guidance genes were recently
reported to be involved in pancreatic carcinogenesis (Biankin
et al., 2012) and may also play a role in other cancers (Mehlen
et al., 2011). Alternative promoter usage was observed only for 8
genes involving 20 transcripts, whereas mostly all transcripts of a
gene that were classiﬁed to component 6 were consistently upre-
gulated or downregulated. T PM] and SM T N were among these
eight genes and are involved in actin cytoskeleton development
and stabilization.

H.-U.Klein et al.

 

For the repressive H3K27me3 mark, we obtained an estimated
weight of 7%, = 0.060 (726 = 0.015) and 2 098 (436) transcripts
that were classiﬁed to the negative (positive) component
(Supplementary Fig. S3D—F, Supplementary Table S5 and
Supplementary Spreadsheet S3). The same three pathways
derived from the H3K4me3 model were also signiﬁcant (FDR
< 0.05) when the pathway analysis was applied to the transcripts
classiﬁed as negative by the model ﬁtted with the H3K27me3
data. In all, 976 of the 2098 transcripts of the negative compo-
nent were classiﬁed as positive by the model based on the
H3K4me3 data, reﬂecting interactions between occurrences of
active H3K4me3 and repressive H3K27me3 marks.

3.3 Simulated dataset

The simulated dataset contained 2000 of 21236 transcripts with
equally directed differences in both data types. Our approach
classiﬁed 1656 of these transcripts into the positive component.
A total of 15 transcripts were falsely classiﬁed to the positive
component, and 344 transcripts were falsely classiﬁed to a null
or negative component. In summary, a sensitivity of 0.828 and a
speciﬁcity of 0.999 were observed. We compared our approach
with a naive separate analysis of both data types. The differences
X, — A, of the gene transcription and Y, — B, of the ChIP-seq
values were calculated, and a threshold t was chosen. All k tran-
scripts with IX, — A,| Z t were considered as differentially tran-
scribed, and the k transcripts with the largest absolute differences
|Y, — B,| were considered as differentially histone modiﬁed.
A Receiver-Operating Characteristic curve was plotted for vary-
ing thresholds t and compared with the results obtained from our
integrative method (Supplementary Fig. S6). At the same level of
speciﬁcity, the naive approach achieved a smaller sensitivity of
0.683, probably due to a loss of information caused by the sep-
arate analyses. Supplementary Table S7 shows that especially for
moderate differences, our approach achieved a gain in sensitivity
of ~0.3.

4 DISCUSSION

The presented results are consistent with the literature (Zhang
et al., 2009) with respect to the association between gene tran-
scription and histone modiﬁcations. Results from the simulated
dataset and from comparing two biological replicates from the
Cebpa dataset give evidence for a high speciﬁcity when detecting
transcripts with differences in both datasets. Furthermore, the
simulation study indicates that a reasonable sensitivity may be
achieved. This is substantiated by the good reproducibility of the
classiﬁcation results when splitting the Cebpa dataset into two
datasets of sample size one.

Using distributions of different types is beneﬁcial for classify-
ing transcripts in our Bayesian mixture model approach. In com-
bination with a small ﬁxed number of components, it helps to
avoid label switching problems that often occur for mixture
models with a large number of normal components, of which a
considerable proportion often remains empty. In preliminary
analyses, a mixture model using exclusively normal components
had to use 15 components to achieve both a good overall ﬁt and
three contiguous classes where the proposed new model only
needs six.

When ﬁtting the mixture model with the EM algorithm (like in
Taslim et al., 2009), the results depended on the set of initial
values due to convergence in different local maxima (see
Supplementary Fig. S10). It was shown that some initial values
did not result in reasonable classiﬁcations, although they led to a
higher likelihood. Although in our Bayesian framework in com-
bination with MCMC algorithms for model ﬁtting, informative
prior distributions had to be chosen to ensure a sensible classiﬁ-
cation, we argue that this explicit model-based approach is pref-
erable, at least when it is consistent across several datasets like in
our analysis. Moreover, unlike the EM algorithm, the Bayesian
framework allows for several possible extensions of the model,
such as incorporation of interactions and spatial correlation
between the transcripts.

Compared with naive separate analyses of both datasets, our
approach demonstrated to be superior in the simulation study.
This is probably due to the fact that the classiﬁcation is based
on information from both datasets aggregated by our score given
in Equation (1) and underlines the need for novel integrative
methods for studies incorporating more than one genomic
dataset. Model-based classiﬁcation may consume more comput-
ing time but has the advantage that no threshold has to be
chosen, in contrast to naive approaches based on P—value or
fold-change rankings.

We consider our approach as an appropriate framework also
for other classiﬁcation tasks when integrating two types of
‘omics’ data, helping to cope with sophisticated distributions
when the number of clusters is known. As alternatives to the
proposed model, a model with a variable number of components
or a different number of components in the mixture may be
considered. However, a ﬁxed number of components, whereas
less ﬂexible in terms of model ﬁt, holds more beneﬁts in terms of
interpretability and is often preferred when classiﬁcation is the
major goal of the analysis, and the number of clusters is obvious
due to the underlying biological question. Kormaksson et al.
(2012), e. g. use a two-component normal mixture model to clas-
sify probe sets with respect to low or high methylation, whereas
Broet and Richardson (2006) and Wei and Pan (2008) ﬁt three-
component models to classify loci into being unmodiﬁed or being
subject to loss or gain of genetic material. Although our model
was validated by application to distinct datasets, we do not rule
out the possibility that for datasets of different structure, a dif-
ferent number of components might be optimal. If considered
appropriate for another application, the framework can be easily
adapted to provide for a variable and unlimited number of clus-
ters and/or components, e.g. based on the ﬁnite approximation
to a Dirichlet process mixture model (Ishwaran and James,
2001). In such models, overﬁtting might be an issue and sufﬁcient
sparsity should be ensured for better interpretability (Friihwirth-
Schnatter, 2011). Of course, other distributions may also be
incorporated in the model.

Alternatively, one might consider to approximate the distribu-
tion of each factor in Equation (1) by a normal distribution, and
hence of Z, by a normal-product distribution. We assume that
this works well for datasets that lead to roughly equally formed
positive and negative tails in the Z distribution, when the focus is
on the ﬁt of the distribution. Our model additionally offers the
possibility of classiﬁcation by representing classes by distinct
components of the mixture model and is ﬂexible enough for

one tail of the Z distribution to contain considerably more prob-
ability mass than the other one.

When larger sample sizes are available, uncertainty could be
modeled across samples for each locus, introducing an additional
model layer. An adapted measure Z could be deﬁned similarly as
was done in Schafer et al. (2009) in a frequentist context, focus-
ing on the summands in an externally centered correlation coef-
ﬁcient, which could be assigned an, e.g. normal distribution.

5 CONCLUSION

We propose quantile normalization for ChIP-seq data and a
novel Bayesian mixture approach involving a mixture of mix-
tures and distributions of different type (normal and exponential)
to classify transcripts based on a new measure for the correlation
between histone modiﬁcations and gene transcription. This inte-
grative analysis was able to detect transcripts for which alter-
ations in transcript abundances and histone modiﬁcation exist
between two different conditions in several datasets, including
different histone modiﬁcation and transcription data from
either microarrays or RNA-seq. We assessed the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of our approach based on simulated data and on bio-
logical replicates and showed its superiority toward naive separ-
ate analyses. Given the fact that modern studies are often not
limited to one type of ‘omics’ data, the presented method is a
useful and important tool for the integrated analysis of epigenetic
and transcription data.

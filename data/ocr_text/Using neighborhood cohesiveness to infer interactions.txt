Abstract

Motivation: In recent years, large—scale studies have been undertaken to describe, at least partially,
protein—protein interaction maps, or interactomes, for a number of relevant organisms, including
human. However, current interactomes provide a somehow limited picture of the molecular details
involving protein interactions, mostly because essential experimental information, especially struc—
tural data, is lacking. Indeed, the gap between structural and interactomics information is enlarging
and thus, for most interactions, key experimental information is missing. We elaborate on the ob—
servation that many interactions between proteins involve a pair of their constituent domains and,
thus, the knowledge of how protein domains interact adds very significant information to any inter—
actomic analysis.

Results: In this work, we describe a novel use of the neighborhood cohesiveness property to infer
interactions between protein domains given a protein interaction network. We have shown that
some clustering coefficients can be extended to measure a degree of cohesiveness between two
sets of nodes within a network. Specifically, we used the meet/min coefficient to measure the pro—
portion of interacting nodes between two sets of nodes and the fraction of common neighbors.
This approach extends previous works where homolog coefficients were first defined around net—
work nodes and later around edges. The proposed approach substantially increases both the num—
ber of predicted domain—domain interactions as well as its accuracy as compared with current
methods.

1 Introduction

Cellular processes are regulated by an intricate network of protein—
protein interactions (PPIs) that form both transient as well as more
permanent complexes. Different experimental techniques are used
to determine PPIs (Berggard et 61]., 2007). However, the molecular

details behind the interaction itself are usually not detected and re—
quire other types of assays to be determined. In this context, it is
well—known that protein function is supported by the underlying
structure (Watson et 61]., 2005) and, thus, solving the structure of
protein complexes is essential for a detailed understanding of their

function. Still, the amount of interactomics data, and the speed at
which they are produced, is substantially higher than the pace
at which protein structures can be experimentally obtained.
Consequently, the development of computational methods to pre—
dict some of the details behind sets of proposed PPIs is a must.
Lacking experimental structural information about a certain com—
plex, but having that information for its unbound constituent pro—
teins, probably the best approaches fall in the area of protein
binding site prediction (Segura et al., 2011) or protein docking
(Halperin et al., 2002). Nonetheless, most of these methods are only
suitable when the structure of proteins have been solved, at least
partially. This fact has motivated us to focus on the prediction of
some characteristics of sets of PPIs based on non—structural informa-
tion. In this way, we have focused on the important observation that
most proteins are composed of one or more domains connected
by inter-domain regions (Apic et al., 2001; Ekman et al., 2005).
Moreover, many protein interactions involve a pair of their constitu—
ent domains and, thus, how a particular pair of proteins interacts is
strongly driven by their domains (Apic et al., 2001; Gupta et al.,
2010; Itzhaki et al., 2006) (the important case of intrinsically dis—
ordered proteins will be discussed in Section 3.3). Consequently, the
knowledge of domain—domain interactions (DDIs) is of great value
during the analysis of PPIs, helping, for instance, in the identification
of potential binding sites (Desjarlais and Berg, 1992; Moya—Garcia
and Ranea, 2013; Pawson and Nash, 2003).

The question whether PPIs are mediated via a limited set of do—
main pairs has been approached in different works. Several studies
found that some domain pairs were overrepresented in large datasets
of experimentally determined PPIs (Deng et al., 2002; Gomez et al.,
2003; Liu et al., 2005; Ng et al., 2003; Nye et al., 2005; Riley et al.,
2005 ; Sprinzak and Margalit, 2001). Therefore, the inferred domain
pairs were shared by multiple interactions. Using a different type of
analysis, Itzhaki et al. (2006) studied the relation between structur—
ally derived DDIs and PPI networks of different organisms. Their
statistical analysis proved that the number of PPIs attributed to
DDIs was significantly larger than expected by random. This result
supports the conjecture that PPIs may be driven by a limited cata—
logue of DDIs. However, the fraction of PPIs to which experimen-
tally determined DDIs could be mapped back in 2006 ranged from 6
to 20% in different organisms. Indeed, in this study, we have
observed that the gap between PPIs and experimentally solved DDIs
nowadays remains in a similar proportion, so that current experi-
mental data on DDIs can be mapped to <20% of the PPIs for most
organisms (Section 3.3.2).

Most previous methods to infer DDIs rely on the assumption
that an interaction between a pair of proteins involves at least a pair
of their constituent domains (one from each interacting protein).
One of the first methods was proposed by Sprinzak and Margalit
(2001). In their work, the authors analyzed a particular set of PPIs
looking for domain pairs that co—occurred more frequently in inter—
actions than expected by chance. Later, Deng et al. (2002) used an
expectation maximization algorithm to maximize a certain likeli-
hood function over an observed interactome. Protein interactions
were described in terms of DDI probabilities, and the expectation
maximization algorithm searched for the DDI probabilities that
maximized the likelihood function. This work was extended by
Riley et al. (2005 ) in their domain pair excluding analysis approach.
Riley et al. method calculates different likelihood scores negating
interactions coming from particular domain pairs. In this way, the
authors improved the performance of previous methods, predicting
interaction between domains based on the differences of the likeli-
hood values when a particular domain pair was excluded. Other

approaches used a parsimony model to find the minimum set of
DDIs that could explain the interactions present in a given PPI map
(Chen et al., 2011). Finally, several methods introduced other types
of data, such as correlated mutation at protein interfaces
(Jothi et al., 2006; Kann et al., 2007), gene ontology (GO) terms
(Liu et al., 2009) or co—evolutionary data (Pazos and Valencia,
2008).

In this work, we describe a new strategy to infer DDIs based on
the topology of a protein interaction network. This approach ex-
ploits the neighborhood cohesiveness (NC) property of small—world
networks (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), analyzing the interactions be—
tween two sets of nodes that contain proteins with a particular do—
main. In this way, we have extended previous definitions of NC,
first calculated on a network node (Watts and Strogatz, 1998), later
on a network edge (Goldberg and Roth, 2003) and in this work
defined over two sets of nodes within the network. Particularly, we
used the meet/min coefficient (Ravasz et al., 2002) to measure the
proportion of interacting nodes between two sets of nodes and the
fraction of common neighbors. Although more sophisticated cluster—
ing coefficients (Hulovatyy et al., 2014) could be used, we will prove
that this simple cohesiveness measure already has enough discrim—
inative power to differentiate between interacting and non—interact—
ing domains. The performance has been tested using a novel
DDI benchmark compiled using 3DID (Mosca et al., 2014) and
Negatome (Blohm et al., 2014) data. We have compared our meth—
odology against the correlated sequence signature (CSS) method
(Sprinzak and Margalit, 2001) and DOMINE predicted data
(Yellaboina et al., 2011), showing that the proposed approach is
competitive with previous methods. Finally, the approach and the
PPI data used during the present development have been integrated
together into a web platform termed DIMERO (Data Integration
for MolEcuar stRucture mOdelling). DIMERO allows both the
evaluation of interactions between domains as well as a direct access
to source data in the form of the PPIs used for the evaluation. In this
way, browsing these PPI data offers the possibility to find additional
information about known interactions involving the domains of
interest, including experimental data, information from prediction
methods and scientific literature.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 The negative sample problem

The lack of experimentally determined non-interacting domain pairs
makes the evaluation of DDI prediction methods a challenging prob-
lem. Typically, positive cases for testing DDI predictions are col—
lected from crystal structures of protein complexes (Jothi et al.,
2006; Liu et al., 2009). However, the negative sampling has been
handled in different ways. Several works compared the distributions
of scores between known interacting domains and random pairs se—
lected from proteins of different cellular compartments (Ben-Hur
and Noble, 2006). Other works measured the fold enrichment be—
tween the number of predicted interactions and the number of pre—
dictions known to be true (Liu et al., 2009). Also, several authors
used PPI datasets to evaluate their DDI predictions (Chen et al.,
2011; Sprinzak and Margalit, 2001); nonetheless, it should be noted
that the negative sampling for PPI presents a similar problem. In this
work, we followed a different approach, using the data collected in
the Negatome database (Blohm et al., 2014). This database is a re—
pository of protein and domain pairs that are unlikely to engage in a
physical interaction. The data are collected by means of data mining
algorithms and filtered by manual curation, minimizing the number
of false negative pairs of the resulting dataset.

Using neighborhood cohesiveness to infer interactions between protein domains 2547

 

2.2 Data framework

Four different databases were used for developing and benchmark—
ing the here presented DDI scoring system. STRING DB
(Franceschini et al., 2013) was the source of the interactomic net—
works for different organisms. This database offers a large collection
of experimentally obtained, data mined as well as predicted inter—
actions between proteins. For the purpose of this work, only inter-
actions that were annotated as ‘binding’ were considered. The
resulting dataset consisted of 28 888 908 interactions involving
2 135 719 proteins from 1133 organisms. Supplementary Figure 81
in Supplementary Material shows that the distribution and relation
between the number of proteins and interactions contained in the
different networks. Then, for each protein involved in these inter—
actions, its constituent domains were defined in terms of the Pfam
classification (v27) (Finn et al., 2014) and delineated using the
HMMER algorithm (Johnson et al., 2010). Finally, this protein do—
main information was annotated into the interactomic network
nodes, setting up the framework for the assessment of domain
interactions.

The DDI benchmark was constructed using two databases:
3DID (Mosca et al., 2014) and Negatome DB (Blohm et al., 2014).
3DID is a compilation of structurally solved domain interactions
mined from the PDB (Rose et al., 2013). The positive cases were
extracted from this database selecting the domain interactions be—
tween different protein chains of binary complexes. Finally, the
interactions between domains of the same family were rejected. The
resulting dataset contained 1405 Pfam domain pairs; this set will be
referred to as positive domain—domain interaction (PDDI). The
negative samples of the benchmark were gathered from Negatome
DB, using the ‘Manual—Pfam’ set, containing 1453 domain pairs
which, in the context of this work, will be referred to as negative do—
main-domain interaction (NDDI).

2.3 From network topology to DDI scores

Our DDI assessment methodology exploits the NC property of
small-world networks in a similar way to the approach proposed by
Goldberg and Roth (2003). In their work, Goldberg and Roth
defined four variants of a mutual cluster coefficient to measure NC
around edges in a protein network, i.e. interactions. The authors
proved that measurements of NC around network edges (protein
interactions) had higher values than in pairs of proteins for which
there was no evidence of interaction. Therefore, proteins sharing
many neighbors in a PPI network were more likely to interact.
Finally, these metrics were used to predict false interactions in pro—
tein networks derived from high—throughput experiments. Following
a similar strategy, we have extended the meet/min coefficient
(Ravasz et al., 2002) defining two metrics that quantify a cohesive—
ness degree between two sets of nodes within a network. This ap—
proach extends previous works where a mutual cluster coefficient
was defined, first around network nodes (Watts and Strogatz, 1998)
and later on around edges (Goldberg and Roth, 2003). Furthermore,
we prove that these measures can be used to infer DDIs when the se—
lected sets include the network proteins that contain specific do—
mains (Sections 3.1 and 3.2).

The main purpose of this work is the identification of potential
interactions between domain families and its application to explore
protein interactomic data. For that reason, the scores presented in
this section have been expressed as a function of protein domains in-
stead of using a graph—based description.

In this work, a protein interaction network for a particular or—
ganism, as the one shown in Figure 1A, is described as a 3—tuple

spatially rearranged while keeping the node connectivity, so that all proteins

those associated to db are within the dashed green line. In a solid red area
delineated by a dashed black line, we show those directly interacting nodes
of da contained in the network region of db, the opposite case is shown within

bors nodes of the proteins in the network region defined by da, encircled in

(P, A, I), where P is the set of proteins in the network, A is the set of
all domains in the proteins and, finally, IP x P is the set of PPIs in
the network, being (P, I) an undirected graph.

For a given protein [J E P, its neighborhood in the network is
defined as the set of nodes that interact with p, thus

N0?) = {q E P; (19761) E I} (1)

Let (3 E A be a protein domain, then the network region of (3 is
defined as the set of nodes (proteins) that contain the domain (3 and
formally is denoted as

R03) = {q E P; 5 E q} (2)

The network surroundings of a domain (3 is defined by the nodes

that interact with any protein of R((3), thus
N 8 = U N (3)

The first proposed metric is the interacting nodes proportion,
noted as 611203”, 5m). It measures the degree of directly interacting
nodes that exists between two domain regions in the network. This
metric calculates the maximum fraction of elements in the network
surrounding of one domain that intersects with the region of a se—
cond domain

The metrics presented in this section follow the same principles
as the meet/min coefficient (Ravasz et al., 2002), a broadly used
measure in the context of PPI networks (Goldberg and Roth, 2003;
Li et al., 2011). More sophisticated approaches (Hulovatyy et al.,
2014) could be adapted to calculate cohesiveness between sets of
proteins, potentially leading to more accurate results. However, the
main purpose of this work is to prove that basic measures of NC
have enough discriminative power to differentiate between interact—
ing and non-interacting domains.

2.4 STRING data for the assessment of DDIs

Domain interaction metrics presented in Section 2.3 are calculated
per interactomic network. Therefore, these calculations have to be
extended to multiple interactomic networks from multiple organ-
isms so that, for each one of them, metric values for the particular
domain pairs of that network are obtained. Then, the global score is
computed as the average among all organisms of the values corres—
ponding to each domain pair; thus

— |®|o€®

where 62(5,“ (SM) is the interacting node proportion (Equation 4), or
the common neighborhood proportion (Equation 5 ), between do—
mains 5n and (3m in the interactome 0. Note that although averaging
information from multiple organisms certainly led to better per—
formance, metrics 61p (Equation 4) and ch (Equation 5) computed
on single interactomes already have enough discriminative power in
themselves (Section 3.2 and Supplementary Material, Section S5).

Final assessment was done using established statistical measures
such as Precision, Recall, areas under precision—recall (AUPR) and
receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curves, the Mathew cor—
relation coefficient (MCC) and the Mann—Whitney—Wilcoxon
(MWW) test, that are presented in detail in Supplementary Material
(Supplementary Section S2).

2.5 Combining the interacting and neighborhood
proportion scores

We combined the interacting nodes proportion score 51p and the
common neighborhood proportion score sz (Section 2.4) into a sin—
gle binary classifier named the combined proportion (CP). The CP
classifier is based in the following strategy: a domain pair (5, (3’) is
classified as interacting if 5112(5, (3’) > K112 or sz((3, (3’) > K Np, where
K112 and K Np are two thresholds selected under a certain criteria. For
example, in this work we have used those thresholds that maximises
the MCC of 51p and sz, respectively (Section 3.1).

This strategy, however, does not explicitly provide a score or
statistical confidence measure. Consequently, in Supplementary
Material (Supplementary Section S3) we present the conventions
used in this work to describe confidence levels as high confident
(HCP), medium confident (MCP) and low confident predictions
(LCP).

2.6 The web application: DIMERO WS

DIMERO WS is a dedicated web platform that integrates the pre—
dicted DDI scores and the CP classifier (Sections 2.4 and 2.5) with
the PPI data used for their calculations. The platform is composed of
a collection of python and JavaScript packages. The server was pro—
grammed in python language using the PDB structural library of
Biopython (Hamelryck and Manderick, 2003). Also, HMMER
(Johnson et al., 2010) was integrated in the server to calculate
the domains of protein sequences based on Pfam classification

3 Results

3.1 Performance on the DDI benchmark

To assess the power of 51p and sz scores (Section 2.4) inferring
DDIs, we have compared their distributions on NDDI and PDDI
datasets. To this end, PDDI and NDDI score distributions are repre-
sented using a boxplot schema (Fig. 2, PDDI scores in green and
NDDI scores in red) for the scores 51p (Fig. 2, $112) and sz (Fig. 2,
sz). Figure 2 shows that, in general, score values on PDDI domain
pairs tend to be larger than on the corresponding NDDI set. To con—
firm this observation, we computed the MWW (Supplementary
Material, Section S2) test on PDDI and NDDI distributions for both
scores. In both cases, the MWW test resulted in the rejection of the
null hypothesis (P—value < 0.001) that score distributions for PDDI
and NDDI are both equal.

Also, the performance of the scores was measured in terms of
the precision, recall, AUPR, AUROC and MCC (Supplementary
Material, Section S2). Supplementary Figure 82C in Supplementary
Material shows that the precision—recall curves when the score
threshold to consider a domain pair as interacting is decreased from
1 to 0. Table 1 shows that how the AUPR value for both scores is
greater than 0.49, the AUPR value of a random classification for
PDDI and NDDI benchmark. Also, the AUC value was better than
the expected value of a random classifier (AUC value of 0.5). MCC
measures the quality of a binary classification, in this case between
interacting and non—interacting domains. All the methods achieved a
MCC greater than 0 and, thus, their classification performance was
better than random. The score 5112 achieved a maximum MCC of
0.41 when a pair of domains (5,5’) was considered interacting if
5112(5, (3’) > 0.037. For this threshold, the recall and precision were
44.2 and 83.8%, respectively; from 741 domain pairs predicted as
interacting, 621 were true and 120 false. For the SNP score, the best
MCC was 0.43, this value was achieved when a domain pair was
classified as interacting if sz((3, (3’) > 0.45. In this case, the preci—
sion and recall were 48.2 and 83.6%, respectively; from 811 domain
pairs classified as interacting, 678 were true predictions and 133
false. Table 1 shows the precision and recall when the MCC
achieved its maximum value.

In terms of computational cost, computing the 51p and sz scores
took close to 20 and 30 min, respectively, using 256 Intel Xeon
CPUs at 2 GHz.

To demonstrate whether the performance of the scores truly de—
pends on the topology of the PPI networks, we applied the same
evaluation process using random interactomes. To this end, we gen—
erated a random network for each organism in STRING employing
the following strategy: networks were constructed using the original
set of nodes and generating an equal number of random interactions
as in the original interactome. Finally, 51p and sz scores were com—
puted using the random generated interactomes and evaluated on
PDDI and NDDI domain pairs. Supplementary Figure S3
(Supplementary Material Section S4) shows that the distribution of
MCC, AUROC and AUPR for the 51p and sz scores inferring DDIs
when this process is repeated 103 times. Indeed, the distributions of
these measures are close to a random classification. For example,
none of the tests led to an AUROC greater than 0.506 for the 51p
score and 0.512 for the SNP score. Therefore, the topology of the PPI
networks is an essential contribution for the predictive power of the
proposed scores.

Finally, we used the thresholds that maximized the MCC of the
51p and sz scores to set up the CP classifier (Section 2.5). Thus, a
domain pair (5, (3’) was classified as interacting if 5112(5, (3’) > 0.037
or sz((3, (3’) > 0.45 . Table 1 shows that the performance of the CP
classifier when is evaluated on PDDI and NDDI domain pairs. The
CP classifier achieved a MCC of 0.53 with a recall and precision
value of 67.7 and 81.3%, respectively, clearly showing that recall is
increased, while maintaining a similar level of precision when com-
pared with the srp or sz scores. Note that AUROC and AUPR can—
not be calculated on a binary classifier.

3.2 Comparison with previous studies

We compared the performance of the 51p, sz scores (Section 2.4)
and the CP classifier (Section 2.5) inferring DDIs against two previ—
ous studies: The CSSs method proposed by Sprinzak and Margalit
(2001), first, and the predictions stored in DOMINE database
(Yellaboina et al., 2011), second.

CSS approach was designed to find combinations of domain
pairs that occur more frequently than random in particular PPI data-
sets. We evaluated the CSS method scoring the domain pairs of
PDDI and NDDI among the different interactomes of STRING. To
merge the CSS values computed on the different networks we used
the same strategy as proposed in Section 2.4. Also, the same nota—
tion was adopted; thus, cC55(5, (3’) denotes the CSS value of two do—
mains calculated on a single interactome and sc55(5, (3’) the average
of the CCSS values among different networks. Table 2 shows that the
performance of the scgg score predicting DDIs on the PDDI and
NDDI datasets. The proposed scores 51p, sz (Sections 2.4) and the

DDIs on single networks, we computed their values on the PDDI
and NDDI datasets using the interactomes of STRING individually.
Thus, the evaluation of the metrics was done for each network of
STRING independently. Supplementary Figure S4 (Supplementary
Material, Section S5) shows that the performance of the metrics pre—
dicting DDIs for the individual interactomes. The figure displays the
relation between the number of interactions contained in the net—
work and the MCC, AUROC and AUPR achieved by the metrics. In
general, the performance of the three metrics improved the more
interactions were contained in the networks. For all interactomes
the best performance in terms of MCC, AUROC or AUPR was
achieved by the ch metric except for zebrafish and saccharomyces
where cogs achieved a better MCC. Finally, for all interactomes
none of the metrics 61p, ch or ccss achieved a better performance
inferring DDIs than averaging their values over all networks; leading
to the 51p, sz or scss scores (confront Supplementary Fig. S4; Tables
1 and 2).

The second comparison was between the CP classifier and
DOMINE database. This database contains DDI predictions using
seven different methods. The predictions are classified into low, me—
dium and high confident, depending on the number of methods that
confirm a particular DDI and the shared GO terms between the do—
mains. Domain information in DOMINE is based on Pfam classifi—
cation v22. Then, to build a proper and fare benchmark, we filtered
PDDI and NDDI domain pairs selecting only those pairs for which
both domains were defined in Pfam v22. The result was a set of 980
positive cases and 1115 negative cases. Then, for the resulting pairs,
we checked whether they were present in DOMINE or not. If a do—
main pair was present in the database, then it was classified as inter—
acting and scored in terms of low, medium or confident prediction
as defined in DOMINE. On the other hand, those domain pairs that
were not present in the database were classified as non—interacting.

Table 3 shows that the performance of DOMINE when the pre-
dicted interactions are defined by the low, medium or high confident
domain pairs. In all cases the CP classifier achieved a better MCC

presents the average number of reported binding domains per interaction.

than DOMINE predictions and, thus, a more accurate classification.
The medium and HCPs DOMINE had a better precision than the
CP classifier but a lower recall value. When the thresholds (0.32 for
51p and 0.85 for sz) for the CP classifier were set up to have a simi—
lar precision as the medium and HCPs of DOMINE (97%), then the
recall of the CP classifier was 23% with a MCC value of 0.35, out—
performing DOMINE predictions.

3.3 DDIs as mediators of PPIs

In this section, we want to analyze quantitatively the increment in
the capacity to assign detailed molecular information at the DDI
level to sets of PPIs, when using the method proposed in this work
as opposed to not using it. The detailed derivations are presented
in Supplementary Material (Supplementary Section S6), extracting
here the main conclusion.

3.3.1 Human interactome analysis

Given a complete interactome, the number of all possible DDIs is
large, creating ambiguities as to the precise molecular mechanisms
involved. As an example, we have considered a subset of all human
interactions compiled in Interactome3D database (Mosca et al.,
2013), formed by those interactions involving multi-domain pro-
teins for which no molecular information is available. The resulting
dataset contained 23 785 interactions. If we now calculate the num—
ber of all possible non—identical pairs of domains involved in these
interactions, we obtain the number of 44 750 different domain pairs.
In turn, the average number of domain pairs per interaction
amounts to 5 .4. We now considered CP classifier using the three
thresholds defined in Supplementary Material (Supplementary
Section S3): HCPs, MCPs and LCPs. Table 4 shows that how the
total number of binding domains is reduced when domain pairs are
accepted or rejected with the different thresholds and, thus, how the
average number of ‘allowed’ domain combinations per interaction
decreases, reducing ambiguities.

At this point, we would like to highlight two of the important
limitations of this type of methodologies. First, when several copies
of a particular domain are present in a protein, this type of predic—
tion methods are not able to distinguish which of these copies is
more likely to interact and all of them are scored the same. For ex—
ample, in the dataset analyzed above, we found that 1263 proteins
contained several copies of one domain. These proteins were
involved in 5026 interactions; thus, nearly 25% of the analyzed set
of interactions present ambiguities with respect to the precise do—
main involved in the interaction. Second, it has been estimated that

knowledge

intrinsically disordered proteins are involved in 49% of human PPIs
(Mosca et al., 2012) and thus, binding regions for these interactions
may not be contained in folded domains.

3.3.2 STRING interactions analysis

We were interested in analyzing what was the proportion of PPIs in
STRING to which structurally solved DDIs could be mapped. To
that end, we considered all DDIs between different protein chains
stored in 3DID and then calculated the proportion for the different
organisms in STRING. Figure 3 (red boxplots) shows these results
using a boxplot diagram for different STRING scores. For all se—
lected scores, the average proportion of PPIs to which DDIs could be
mapped was <20%.

We explored the possibility of using the CP classifier (Section
2.5) to predict new DDIs and, consequently, increase the proportion
of PPIs to which domain interactions could be mapped. Figure 3
(green boxplots) shows that the proportion of PPIs to which the new
predicted set of DDIs can be mapped; in this case the average pro—
portion is >60% for the selected scores. In general, DDI prediction
offers the possibility to extend information derived from structural
data and increase the range of PPI candidates.

3.4 Analysing interactions with DIMERO WS

In this section, we show how DIMERO WS can be used to analyse
the interactions between different proteins. In this example, we have
studied the interactions between the proteins of the apoptosis path—
way defined in the KEGG database (Kanehisa et al., 2014). Nodes
in a KEGG pathway may represent several genes or proteins. In this
study, we have considered all possible interactions when an edge be—
tween two nodes involves multiple protein pairs.

The apoptosis pathway contains 83 proteins and 173 interactions.
We used DIMERO WS to evaluate the potential binding domains
involved in the different interactions of the pathway. In this way,
DIMERO WS computed the CP classifier for all possible domain
binding pairs, classifying them as HPCs, MCPs and LCPs.

Fig. 4. Apoptosis pathway defined in KEGG database with additional information on DDIs mapped onto it. The nodes of the network represent proteins and the

edges interactions between the proteins. The edge color indicates the best prediction for the CP classifier among all possible DDIs considering the proteins
involved. Green lines indicate that at least one domain pair scored as a HCP, while orange lines correspond to MCPs, red lines to LCPs and grey lines mark the
case for which the score was not significant. The line type of the edges indicates whether an experimentally solved structure is available for at least one of the
possible domain pairs involved in the interaction (continuous lines) or not (discontinuous lines) (Color version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

Additionally, DIMERO WS linked the domain pairs with structural
data when the structure of the interacting domains had been experi-
mentally solved. Finally, Cytoscape (Smoot et al., 2011) was used to
represent the pathway at protein level and to annotate the edges with
the CP predictions (Fig. 4). Protein interactions in the pathway were
colored in terms of their best scored domain pair. In 62 interactions
the method predicted at least one domain pair as HCP (green lines). In
76 interactions the method scored at least one of the domain pairs as
MCP (orange lines). Finally, in 18 interactions the method scored at
least one domain pair as LCP (red lines) and in 11 cases scores were
not considered significant (grey lines). Thus, the CP classifier predicted
binding domains for 90% of all possible interactions in the pathway.

Additionally, the type of line used to draw an edge referred to in—
formation regarding the availability (or lack of it) of experimentally
determined structures. In this way, for 78 interactions of the apop—
tosis pathway, at least one of the possible binding domain pairs can
be mapped to an experimentally solved structure. Interactions be—
tween the proteins of the pathway lead to 297 different binding do—
main pairs. When these pairs were evaluated with DIMERO WS, 29
pairs were classified as HCP, 96 as MCP and 85 as LCP. From the
297 different domain pairs, 22 could be mapped to solved structures
and were involved in 78 interactions, as indicated in the previous
paragraph. It is very interesting to note the behavior of the DDI pre-
diction method on this set of experimentally solved structures. In
this way, four of these pairs were classified as HCP, nine as MCP
and nine as LCP. Thus, none of these pairs were considered to be
below the significance level. An additional observation is that these
22 domain pairs can be classified in 7 homo—interactions and 15 het—
ero interactions, and that hetero—interactions were scored higher
(four as HCP, eight as MCP and three as LCP) than homo-inter-
actions (one as MCP and six as LCP). This different behavior is
related to the fact that the neighborhood proportion measure cannot
be used to compare a set of nodes with itself and, consequently, only
the interacting node proportion can be used in these cases, while
both scores (st and sz) are used for hetero—interactions.

Finally, we analyzed some of the domain pairs classified as HCP
and that were not mapped to solved structures. In this way, we found
some interesting results involving kinase domains and phosphoryl-
ation events. For example, in the interaction between the protein kin-
ase B family members (AKT1, AKT2 and AKT3) and the IKK
complex (CHUK, IKBKB and IKBKG), the kinase—NEMO DDI was
classified as HCP. Although, we cannot ensure this is a real interaction
it is known that the NEMO domain of the IKBKG subunit is phos—
phorylated in other signaling processes (Palkowitsch et al., 2008; Wu
et al., 2006). A similar result was found between the protein kinase B
family and the BAD protein; but in this case there is experimental evi—
dence supporting that AKT1 protein kinase indeed phosphorylates the
Bcl-2_BAD domain of the BAD protein (Koh et al., 2000), although
no atomic structure of this complex has yet been obtained.

4 Conclusions

This work presents a novel application of NC property to infer inter—
actions between protein domains. The approach is suitable for large
scale prediction of detailed molecular information to be further con-
sidered in the understanding of interactomes. In this way, we are
able to assign a significant value to the interaction of pairs of protein
domains involved in a given interaction, filtering the less probable
bindings. With this approach we are able to significantly extend cur—
rent binding information coming from sets of experimentally deter—
mined structures, outperforming previously proposed methods.

Finally, a user-friendly web platform is available at http://
dimero.cnb.csic.es, allowing the use to query about DDIs at the
same that it provides direct access to the data used to calculate the
interaction scores.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Accurate annotations of genomic variants are necessary
to achieve full-genome clinical interpretations that are scientifically
sound and medically relevant. Many disease associations, especially
those reported before the completion of the HGP, are limited
in applicability because of potential inconsistencies with our
current standards for genomic coordinates, nomenclature and gene
structure. In an effort to validate and link variants from the medical
genetics literature to an unambiguous reference for each variant,
we developed a software pipeline and reviewed 68 641 single
amino acid mutations from Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man
(OMIM), Human Gene Mutation Database (HGMD) and dbSNP. The
frequency of unresolved mutation annotations varied widely among
the databases, ranging from 4 to 23%. A taxonomy of primary causes
for unresolved mutations was produced.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large numbers of genetic variants from medical and genetics
publications have been compiled in databases, including the Online
Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM), the Human Gene Mutation
Database (HGMD), among others. For example, the HGMD
(Stenson et al., 2009) has curated 100 329 disease-associated genetic
variants in its current release (March 2010), and OMIM has
described 20 068 variants as of June 2010 (Amberger et al., 2009).
These disease-associated variants are valuable in the understanding,
prevention and diagnosis of human disease. With the imminent
reduction to practice of whole- genome interpretation (Ashley et al.,
2010; Ormond et al., 2010), an overview of the accuracy of
these databases is important in understanding how much quality
improvement work remains to make these prior genome-wide
annotations clinically useful. We focus here on the syntactic
accuracy of the annotations which are an important but small step
toward assessing their clinical validity (Kohane et al., 2006).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

To this end, we developed a software module, aa2nt, which
provides basic validation of single amino acid changes using
information from current databases, derives the corresponding DNA
change from an amino acid change and generates Human Genome
Variation Society (HGVS)-recommended names (Supplementary
Fig. S1). We applied aa2nt to a selected set of variants from three
commonly used databases (OMIM, HGMD and dbSNP) to evaluate
whether we could correctly resolve the locations of variants in
current annotation databases. We validated 66 638 single nucleotide
mutations from OMIM, HGMD and dbSNP and obtained a passing
rate ranging from 77 to 96%.

2 METHODS

The following algorithm was used to validate and map amino acid
substitutions caused by a single nucleotide change:

1. Required input data: gene symbol, codon number, wild-type amino
acid, variant amino acid.

1.1 Replace gene synonyms with ofﬁcial gene symbols by querying
data available in Entrez Gene (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.g0V/gene/DATA/
gene_inf0.gz).

1.2 Retrieve available human cDNA sequences from RefSeq (ftp://
ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/refseq/H_sapiens/mRNA_Prot/human.ma.gbff.
gz) for the given gene.

2. For each cDNA transcript obtained in step 1.2, generates the cDNA
codon sequence corresponding to the codon number of amino acid
change, and translate it to the corresponding amino acid.

3. Compare the obtained amino acid to the ‘wild-type’ reference amino
acid at that position.
3.1 If identical, it is validated.

3.2 Otherwise, test if the gene has a signal peptide (http://www.
signalpeptidedel), which could alter the codon numbering. If yes,
adjust the codon number with signal peptide added.

4. Identify all possible single nucleotide changes from the reference
codon sequence to all the possible genetic codons of the variant amino
acid.

5. Generate tuple of HGVS name(s) of DNA and protein changes.

A detailed ﬂow chart illustrating this process with sample data can be
found in the Supplementary Materials (Supplementary Figure SI).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Validation of variants by codon number and amino
acid substitutions

We selected 10054 single amino acid substitution variants from
OMIM (Supplementary Table S1), 58182 variants from HGMD,
57479 variants from HGMD where the HGVS codon number is
available, 2646 variants from table OmimVarLocusIdSNP in dbSNP
(ftp://ftp.ncbi.nih.g0V/snp/organisms/human_9606/database/
organism_data/OmimVarLocusIdSNP.bcp.gz, Supplementary
Table S2) as input ﬁles for the validation program. The results of
validations are summarized in Table 1.

3.2 Validating program performance using a
gold-standard dataset

To evaluate the accuracy of base changes predicted from the
speciﬁed amino acid change, we selected 5959 mutations in OMIM
which have details about the speciﬁc base change involved in the
HGMD. 5113 (86%) of 5959 variants mapped to a single nucleotide
change identical to one described in HGMD. The remaining 846
variants mapped to more than one possible codon. If the highest
frequency codon is used based on the frequency table (Nakamura
et al., 2000), 5586 (94%) of the predicted codons agree with the
mutant codon sequence in HGMD. The aa2nt module does not
predict codon change(s) if more than one nucleotide is required to
make the prediction.

3.3 Evaluation of major categories of unresolved
annotations

We analyzed 2332 annotations from the OMIM database which
did not achieve proper resolution using the aa2nt test pipeline, and
grouped them into the following categories:

0 Amino acid assignment problems: the annotated amino acid was
not present at the described location in any of the known gene
product isoforms. Of the 2044 unresolved variants, we checked
if the gene products contained a signal peptide. Of 2044, 950
did have a signal peptide sequence and 528 of the annotations
passed a second round validation after re-indexing the codon
number with the signal peptide added.

0 Non-standard gene symbols: 258 variants in 75 genes used gene
aliases instead of ofﬁcial gene symbols. After replacing the alias
with an ofﬁcial gene symbol, 219 passed validation.

° Codon number greater than protein length: 27 variants belong
to this class. An example is PTEN, which encodes a protein
of 403 amino acids. Therefore, HIS861ASP (OMIM 601728)
would be invalid.

° Genomic coordinates unavailable: there were three
examples where genomic coordinates were unavailable:
gene ImmunoGlobin Heavy constant Mu (IGHM) is an ofﬁcial
gene symbol, but is not in the University of California at Santa
Cruz (UCSC) gene annotation database table reﬂink (http://
hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg19/database/refLink.
txt.gz). Gene 0A1 and KCNJ 18 (OMIM: 613236) were also
missing coordinate information.

0 Naming of DNA changes: in one mutation, OMIM ID:
600946.0005 (GAA180GAG), the codon change was used to
number the cDNA change. This is inconsistent with the HGVS
suggestion, and it is a GAG to GAA change, not GAA to GAG
(Berg et al., 1992).

In this ﬁrst step of assessing the syntactic validity of the largest
publicly available mutation annotation databases, we found that the
majority of the annotations were accurate. Nonetheless, in aggregate
there were several thousand mutation annotations that did not pass a
simple syntactic veriﬁcation procedure even after allowances were
made for isoforms, signal peptide sequence and the use of gene
symbol aliases rather than the standard nomenclature. There are
other potential explanations for mis-numbered sequences, including
other propeptides that might be cleaved during the post-translational
process. This may explain the difference between the 44% of variants
(422 of 950) that did contain a signal peptide in their sequence
that still did not pass resolution using aa2nt even when it was
considered.

We have made available a list of the variants that did not resolve
using aa2nt to enable a community review and manual annotation
process. These data are available using a web application at http://
safegene.hms.harvard.edu/zak/unresolvedOmimVariants.jsp.

Many of these difﬁculties are the residue of early discovery work
prior to standardization—it is unsurprising that there is difﬁculty
in resolving non—synonymous from OMIM, as the database hosts
historical discoveries from the literature. Other variants that did
not achieve resolution appear to potentially be the result of some
form of data transcription, transfer or copying error. These syntactic
errors fall well short of the clinical requirements for accurate
interpretation of human variants. As we approach whole genome
clinical interpretation, it seems that there is an increasing common
interest and public good in ensuring that all previous and new
annotation data be vetted automatically by a suite of tools such as
aa2nt with a standard resolution procedure for those annotations that
do not pass this validation process. Indeed, such a pipeline appears
to be an essential component to the Genome Commons that some
have envisaged (Brenner, 2007; Field et al., 2009), as well as a
valuable addition to the process of mutation ﬁnding through text
mining (Horn et al., 2004; Kuipers et al., 2010).

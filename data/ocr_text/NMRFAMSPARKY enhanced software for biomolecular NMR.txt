Abstract

Summary: SPARKY (Goddard and Kneller, SPARKY 3) remains the most popular software program
for NMR data analysis, despite the fact that development of the package by its originators ceased
in 2001. We have taken over the development of this package and describe NMRFAM-SPARKY,
which implements new functions reflecting advances in the biomolecular NMR field. NMRFAM-
SPARKY has been repackaged with current versions of Python and TcI/Tk, which support new tools
for NMR peak simulation and graphical assignment determination. These tools, along with chem-
ical shift predictions from the PACSY database, greatly accelerate protein side chain assignments.
NMRFAM-SPARKY supports automated data format interconversion for interfacing with a variety
of web servers including, PECAN , PINE, TALOS-N, CS-Rosetta, SHIFTX2 and PONDEROSA-C/S.

Availability and implementation: The software package, along with binary and source codes, if
desired, can be downloaded freely from http://pine.nmrfam.wisc.edu/download_packages.htmI.
Instruction manuals and video tutorials can be found at http://www.nmrfam.wisc.edu/nmrfam-

1 Introduction

SPARKY (https://www.cgl.ucsf.edu/home/sparky) remains the most
popular computer program for NMR operations, such as peak-
picking and peak assignment (Supplementary Fig. S1), despite that
fact that its originators have not released a new version since 2001
(Goddard and Kneller, 2008, SPARKY 3). SPARKY supports user-
defined enhancements, and we have used these to develop new tools
in support of our packages for automated protein assignment and
structure determination. The added features support (i) interfacing
with servers offering new technologies, (ii) tools for data visualiza-
tion and verification and (iii) new protocols for maximizing the effi-
ciency of NMR data analysis. We have refined these SPARKY
enhancements through their use in our annual workshops by partici-
pants with varying experience in protein NMR spectroscopy. We
describe here the new package, which we have named ‘NMRFAM-
SPARKY’.

2 Implementation

We first replaced Python 2.4 by 2.7 and Tcl/T k 8.4 by 8.6 to enable
the implementation of features related to web services and user
interfaces to platforms including Windows, Mac OS X, and Linux.
We had to use Tcl/Tk 8.5 for the Mac OS X version, because the
8.6 version was incompatible with X11 libraries. Several modifica-
tions of the C++ and Python codes were needed to achieve stability.
Once the new version compiled with Python and Tcl/Tk, we
updated old functions and implemented new functions
(Supplementary Table S1) found to be desirable from our workshops
and research projects. New functions are located under the
NMRFAM menu and are categorized by sub-menus identified by
two-letter codes (Table 1).

Dummy Graph (two-letter-code: dg) offers a generalized version
of the Pine Graph Assigner utility from PINE-SPARKY (Lee et al.,
2009) that does not require use of PINE (Bahrami et al., 2009) or the

PINE2SPARKY converter. Sequence information and assignment situ-
ations are illustrated graphically in real time so as to notify users of
any missing or wrong assignments that need to be fixed. Another use-
ful function is Transfer and Simulate Assignments (two-letter—code:
ta). We used statistics from the PACSY database Lee et al., 2012), a
relational database management system incorporating PDB (Berman
et al., 2007), BMRB (Ulrich et al., 2008), SCOP (Murzin et al., 1995),
STRIDE (Frishman and Argos, 1995) and MolProbity (Chen et al.,
2010), to populate this Python module, which simulates resonance
frequencies dynamically on the basis of conditions such as amino acid
and atom type, preceding and following residues, secondary structure,

pH and temperature. This tool enables a new predict-and—confirm ap-
proach to resonance assignments that is much faster than the trad-
itional pick-and—assign method because the user no longer needs to
refer to a table of BMRB-derived chemical shift. Furthermore, if a 3D
structure is available, it is possible to determine assignments by using
SHIFTX2 prediction to simulate the possible assignments to be
checked. NMRFAM-SPARKY contains a structure predictions menu
that includes PECAN (Eghbalnia et al., 2005), TALOS-N (Shen and
Bax, 2013) and CS-Rosetta (Shen et al., 2009). These tools can be
used to predict the 3D structure so that side chain and NOE assign-
ments can be refined through combined use of CS-Rosetta and
SHIFTX2 (Han et al., 201 1). In favorable cases, the user can complete
the chemical shift assignments and then use the NMRFAM-SPARKY
interface to PONDEROSA-C/S (Lee et al., 2014) to carry out an
NOE-based structure determination in seamless fashion.

NMRFAM-SPARKY contains updated chemical shift statistics
which greatly improve the accuracy and reliability of predictions.
We expanded the number of resonance types (amino acid type plus
atom type) from 273 to 276 (Supplementary Table 52A). By basing
the statistics on the current BMRB chemical shift archive, we
achieved statistical significance for 27 of these resonance types,
which were not considered to be statistically meaningful because
they previously were based on fewer than 30 examples
(Supplementary Table S2B). The average chemical shifts of three of
the resonance types changed by more than one SD (Supplementary
Table 52C). The SDs for chemical shifts of 28 resonance types were
refined by 230% (Supplementary Table 52D), whereas those of an
equivalent number of resonances types were broadened by 230%
(Table Supplementary 52E).

3 Results and Conclusions

Subsequent to announcing the availability of NMRFAM-SPARKY at
workshops, at scientific meetings, and on the NMRFAM website, the
package was downloaded 155 times from sites that provided unique
e-mail addresses over the period May 21, 2014 to September 17,
2014. We expect that use of NMRFAM-SPARKY will increase the
success rate of automated assignment runs on the PINE server and
automated structure determinations on the PONDEROSA-C/S server,
because our analysis shows that most failures stem from incorrectly
formatted input. For similar reasons, data input through NMRFAM-
SPARKY should improve the reliability and successful use of other
programs or web servers, such as TALOS-N and CS-Rosetta.

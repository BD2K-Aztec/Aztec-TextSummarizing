ABSTRACT

Motivation: Genome-wide fitness is an emerging type of high-
throughput biological data generated for individual organisms by
creating libraries of knockouts, subjecting them to broad ranges of
environmental conditions, and measuring the resulting clone-specific
fitnesses. Since fitness is an organism-scale measure of gene regula-
tory network behaviour, it may offer certain advantages when insights
into such phenotypical and functional features are of primary interest
over individual gene expression. Previous works have shown that
genome-wide fitness data can be used to uncover novel gene regu-
latory interactions, when compared with results of more conventional
gene expression analysis. Yet, to date, few algorithms have been
proposed for systematically using genome-wide mutant fitness data
for gene regulatory network inference.

Results: In this article, we describe a model and propose an inference
algorithm for using fitness data from knockout libraries to identify
underlying gene regulatory networks. Unlike most prior methods, the
presented approach captures not only structural, but also dynamical
and non-linear nature of biomolecular systems involved. A state—
space model with non-linear basis is used for dynamically describing
gene regulatory networks. Network structure is then elucidated by
estimating unknown model parameters. Unscented Kalman filter is
used to cope with the non-linearities introduced in the model, which
also enables the algorithm to run in on-line mode for practical use.
Here, we demonstrate that the algorithm provides satisfying results for
both synthetic data as well as empirical measurements of GAL net-
work in yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae and TyrR—LiuR network in
bacteria Shewanella oneidensis.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, modelling and inference of biological regulatory
networks have become an active area of research in large part

owing to the emergence of microarray technology, which allows
for simultaneous measurement of gene expression on the
genome-wide scale (Bonneau et al., 2006; Chou and Voit, 2009;
Friedman et al., 2000; Liang and Wang, 2008; Margolin et al.,
2006; Reiss et al., 2006; Shmulevich et al., 2002; Stuart et al.,
2003). The vast amounts of data provided by gene expression
microarrays enable the possibility of accurate estimation of gene
regulatory network organization, which has greatly beneﬁted a
broad range of disciplines—from basic biological sciences, to bio-
engineering, to medical diagnosis and treatment (Hanai et al.,
2006; Mischel et al., 2004). The goal of inference algorithms is to
discover the connectivity structure and, potentially, dynamic char-
acteristics of these networks based on such time- or other
state-series data. Among other things, the nature of inference al-
gorithms varies depending on the types of biological networks and
the way they are modelled (de J ong, 2002; Hendrickx et al., 2011;
Lecca et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2006; Samoilov et al., 2001;
Shmulevich et al., 2002; Tian and Burrage, 2003; Wang and
Schonfeld, 2010). One category of models quantizes the empirical
data into binary numbers and views network structures as
Boolean constraints (Bornholdt, 2008; Kauffman et al., 2003).
Although this could be attempted in a deterministic framework,
both the uncertainties introduced by measurement errors as well
as the inherent stochasticity of gene expression make any experi-
mental data substantially probabilistic. To impart this random
nature to the Boolean framework, the probability Boolean net-
work models have been introduced (Akutsu et al., 1999; Huang,
1999; Shmulevich et al., 2002). However, as biological processes
are neither digital nor homogeneous, further gene regulatory mod-
elling and inference reﬁnements may be achieved by using alter-
native probabilistic network descriptions (Craciun et al., 2013;
Kellam et al., 2002; Liu et al., 2006), continuous-time differential
equations (Chen et al., 1999; Holter et al., 2001; Wang et al., 2008),
stochastic differential equations (Tian and Burrage, 2003; Yeung
et al., 2002), and control theory methods (Beal et al., 2005; Cook et
al., 1998; Rangel et al., 2004), among others. Although any of
these methods offers certain advantages and disadvantages in at-
tempting to capture the structure and dynamics of gene regulatory
network, it should be noted that they have largely been designed
toward describing gene expression data.

Recently, however, a new type of high-throughput data
has emerged and seen rapid proliferation in empirical biosci-
ences—the genome-wide ﬁtness data. At its core, this involves

Network inference from fitness data

 

using latest technological advances to massively scale the trad-
itional gene deletion/interruption studies in order to achieve
nearly genome-wide coverage by generating knockout/knock-
down mutant strain libraries for all non-essential genes in an
organism (Oh et al., 2010). These libraries are then further sub-
jected to a large number of environmental conditions and stres-
ses—with the observable in each of the settings being the ﬁtness
of individual clones (collected in stationary phase). Pairing the
resulting data with an appropriate model of gene expression then
allows for the inference of the underlying gene regulatory net-
works through estimation of signiﬁcant interaction terms, along
with those for production, degradation, expression level, etc.
Although potentially applicable to any observable type, this ap-
proach may be particularly well-suited for the use with ﬁtness
data to help constrain any inferred gene regulatory network so-
lutions to those dynamic modes that are most important for a
given set of biological functions and conditions—e. g. growth on
speciﬁc substrates or tolerance to certain stresses. Recent works
have indeed suggested that the use of genome-wide ﬁtness data
can provide new perspectives on systems-level organization of
cells and uncover novel gene regulatory interactions when com-
pared with gene expression—based analysis (Hillenmeyer et al.,
2008, 2010); Deutschbauer et al., 2011). Yet, although on a lim-
ited scale the idea of biological network characterization based
on knockout data has been considered before, e.g. Winzeler et al.
(1999), the emergence of high-throughput genome-wide gene
deletion/interruption technology along with the use of popula-
tion ﬁtness rather than gene expression as an observable offers
novel challenges as well as beneﬁts to the task of gene network
inference. On the one hand, microarray and other gene expres-
sion experiments typically generate high-dimensional data in the
form of a real vector that comprises expression levels of multiple
genes at each sampled time and/or condition point, whereas ﬁt-
ness measurements map the state of the system into a much
lower dimensional space—cg. that of a single real variable,
such as growth rate. This inevitably leads to signiﬁcant loss of
information. On the other hand, deletion experiments usually
involve simply cultivating and observing cells, which could be
performed on a substantially larger scale, much more efﬁciently
and under signiﬁcantly greater range of conditions when com-
pared with the relatively demanding gene expression assays. The
ensuing ability to perform experiments simultaneously across the
entire mutant collection substantially increases the overall
genome-wide ﬁtness data dimensionality—often putting it on
par with available gene expression datasets. Furthermore, ﬁtness
observations allow for the preferential selection or overweighting
of clones that display a desirable phenotype, e. g. the stronger the
selection—the more signiﬁcant the contribution of surviving
strains. This becomes an increasingly important factor in many
biotechnological and biomedical applications, whereby the con-
tribution of practically irrelevant genes is effectively being ﬁltered
out—regardless of their statistical signiﬁcance or dynamic state.
Indeed, it has been shown that this type of data is very useful for
the determination of target gene functions (Deutschbauer et al.,
2002, 2011; Hillenmeyer et al., 2010; Pierce et al., 2009; Steinmetz
et al., 2002).

Few systematic models and/or inference algorithms have
been proposed for the elucidation of regulatory networks from
ﬁtness data. Conclusions are often being made on the basis of

visual inspections or similar relatively naive strategies. Yet,
greater prominence and availability of such data along with in-
dications that ﬁtness proﬁling might contain information about
gene regulation suggest the need for a more comprehensive and
rigorous inference approach. The analysis of ample data pro-
vided by genome-wide ﬁtness experiments may also be useful
in complementing network inference methods based on micro-
array gene expression and such other data by helping to initialize
them or further reﬁne their results.

In this work, we propose an algorithm for inferring gene regu-
latory networks from genome-wide knockout ﬁtness data. Our
approach is based on describing biological networks via a
non-linear dynamical model and then elucidating model param-
eters from ﬁtness measurements. The resulting parameter set can
be used to identify the underlying regulatory network structure
as well as to make forward-looking estimates of its function
under temporal dynamics or environmental changes. In Section
2, we describe the system model and problem formulation. In
Section 2.2, we provide a heuristic sample ordering selection al-
gorithm based on correlation score to cope with the order selec-
tion problem that arises when using mutant ﬁtness data. In
Section 3, we describe the parameter estimation algorithm
based on the unscented Kalman ﬁlter (UKF) technique. In
Section 4, we use the proposed algorithm to analyse both a syn-
thetic example as well as experimental data from yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae and bacteria Shewanella oneidensis,
which are further compared against known empirical results.
We conclude the article with a summary and remarks regarding
the proposed model and inference algorithm.

2 SYSTEM MODEL AND PROBLEM
FORMULATION

2.1 System model

The outline of our approach is to describe a gene expression data
model and to then extend it towards accommodating the observ-
ables supplied in the form of a large-scale knockout strain ﬁtness
dataset. To this end, we ﬁrst introduce a basic model of gene
expression as a weighted sum of (non-linear) functions of other
genes with additive noise. We then obtain, through the removal
of individual genes, the knockout strain network models used to
drive the observed ﬁtness model, which thus contains latent vari-
ables of our overall model, as described next in further detail.

Consider a gene regulatory network with total N genes. Let
g,(k), i: 1, ...,N, k = 1,2, ...,M denote the gene expression
level for the i-th gene at time k. We denote observation or meas-
urement data, x,(k), for gi(k) at time k as:

261(k) = gi(k) + Ill-(k), (1)

where Ill-(k) is the observation noise at time k for i-th gene. (Note
that here the term ‘time’ is used in the generalized Bayesian in-
ference sense and so may be loosely viewed as a discrete index
enumerating individual experiments—rather than some continu-
ous parameter of a kinetic biochemical system. Accordingly, the
dynamic model we use is one based on ‘discrete time’, which thus
fundamentally does not a priori assume or require continuity of
states or observables.) We denote gene expression levels
within the network by vector g(k) = [g1 (k), . . . ,gN(k)]T, the

observation vector by x(k) = [x1(k), . . . ,xN(k)]T and noise
vector by v(k) = [v1(k), . . . , vN(k)]T. We assume that all vectors
v(k) for k = 1, . . . , M are independent and jointly Gaussian with
zero mean and variance matrix R(k). We approximate any multi-
variate gene—gene interactions by a combination of a linear ex-
pansion around the stationary solution and univariate non-linear
terms. Speciﬁcally, we follow a discrete-time regulation model
proposed in (Chen and Aihara, 1997) and describe the regulatory
functions among genes as:

N N

give + 1) = Z ang-(k) + Z bt-fJ-(gJ-(k). m) + I.- + mac). (2)
J'=1 J'=1

for i: 1, ...,N, where 61;] denotes the linear regulation coefﬁ-

cient from gene j to gene 1' and A = [6111, . . . ,aNN]T; bi]- denotes

the non-linear regulation coefﬁcient from gene j to gene 1' and

B = [b11,b12, ...,bNN]T;  is the non-linear function for genej

which is given by:

fj(gja Mj) = my (3)

where ,uJ- is the parameter to be inferred and ,u. = [11.1, . . . , ,u.N]T;
I,- denotes the system expression bias for i-th gene and
I = [[1, . . . ,IN]T, which will be inferred later. The noise vectors
w(k) = [w1(k), ...,wN(k)]T for k = 1,2, ...,M are assumed to
be jointly Gaussian with zero mean and variance Q(k). We also
assume that they are independent from all V(k). The regulatory
network is realized as a state—space model, where we view gene
expression levels as states and measurements as observations.
The goal of inference is to estimate all the unknown parameters
in the model. Inference results then provide estimates for all
regulatory relations across the network.

Note that Equations (1) and (2) provide the description of the
system in a manner most commensurate with expression data. We
now proceed to extend this model to accommodate ﬁtness data.
Without loss of generality, we consider the case of a mutant library
with single gene knockout per strain (with multiple-knockout col-
lections being handled analogously, as discussed later) and assume
that jk-th gene has been deleted when the system is at time k. Note
that ‘time’ here corresponds to the experiment number, with the
index jk being determined as discussed in the previous paragraph.
For the purposes of the single-knockout state—space model, ex-
pressions of all genes evolve without participation of gene jk.
Therefore we set all jk regulatory coefﬁcients to zero. The states
and system coefﬁcients equations can then be summarized as:

111k + 1) = 111k); Mi(k + 1) = 111(k) Vi,
aid-4k) = 0; bid-4k) = 0 Vi,
ai,j(k + 1) = 019(k), ifj #J'k,
bi,j(k + 1) = bi,j(k)a ifj #J'k,

N N (4)
give + 1) = Z cry-(earn + Z by(k)ﬁ(gj(k), 11,-)
j=1 j=1

gjk(k+ 1) = gjk(k)-

The last two equations determine the current system coefﬁ-
cients, which will be appended to the system state. Unlike the
case of expression microarrays, here, each gene deletion/interrup-
tion strain measurement quantiﬁes a single system property

which is a function of all the remaining genes. In this article,
we assume this measurement is a real number, which represents
the ﬁtness of the remaining network. (The model can be easily
adapted into higher dimensional measurement case by direct ex-
tension.) Therefore, the observation x(k) becomes:

x(k) =f(g1(k), ---,gN(k)) + V06), (5)

where f : IRN —> IR is typically not known a priori. We denote
R(k) as the variance of V(k) as before.

Various bases could be used to estimate f and associated co-
efﬁcients. For instance, one could use a simple basis such as
power series—i.e. a Taylor expansion. However, the speed of
convergence for Taylor expansion is slow, resulting in a large
number of parameters to be estimated. In contrast, the radial
basis approach has been shown to be more robust and adaptive
than Taylor expansion (Jiang et al., 2003). Furthermore, it has
been shown that with certain additional assumptions, the ap-
proximation by radial basis will converge to the true function
in LP sense (Powell, 1987). Thus, we approximate f as:

P
f(y) ~ 219(in — yfii) +151, (6)
1:1

where A,- for i = 1, . . . , p and A0 are the centres of the basis with
A = [15111, ...,Ap]T; p is the total number of basis functions
used, which is a ﬁxed constant; y}, i, j = 1, . . . , p are the centre
points of the waveform, which are chosen a priori; and
<I>(x) 2: x/ c + xZ—the Hardy multi-quadratic function with con-
stant c>0, which serves as a classical choice for efﬁcient radial
basis expansion (Buhmann, 2003).

All the coefﬁcients A,, i = 1, . . . , p as well as A0 are parameters
to be inferred and so are appended to the state variable.
Therefore, the new augmented model state variable for knockout
ﬁtness data is:

yac) = [gT(k>. AT. BT. IT. MT» 171’" (7)

As a summary, the dynamical model we propose for regulatory
networks with gene deletion/interruption mutant ﬁtness data is:

Y(k + 1) = Fk(y(k)) + W(k) (8)

x(k) =f(1ky(k)) + V(k),

where Fk(-) is the system function described in (4);
W(k) 2 [W1, ...,wN, 0, ...,0] is the augmented noise vector; Ik
is the selection matrix, i.e. Iky = [g1, .. . ,gj*_1,0,gj*+1, . . . ,gN]T,
where the index ‘k is determined by the time index k; V(k) is the
Gaussian noise as assumed before.

2.2 Data feeding order score

To infer the model given in (8), one needs to specify the order in
which data are supplied to the algorithm. The question in what
order data should be optimally fed into the inference algorithm
thus arises. As this problem is fundamentally associated with the
network structure itself, it can be solved exactly only if the struc-
ture of the network is already known. (And even then, the prob-
lem typically has NP-hard complexity since one needs to test all
possible permutations.) Since the feeding order will have direct
impact on the performance of the inference result, we still need a

Network inference from fitness data

 

strategy to ﬁnd an ‘optimal’ feeding order without explicitly
exploring all potential network structures. In this section, we
propose a heuristic strategy based on correlation score, which
is then compared against selecting the feeding order randomly
and shown to be more ‘optimal’ by offering certain advantages.
The basic idea behind the proposed heuristic is that we should
feed the most useful data ﬁrst. In this work, we use correlation as
a measure of such ‘usefulness’. The intuition is that for sequential
inference of the model (8), the data should be fed based on their
importance in a certain sense. The reasoning for this strategy is
that, in sequential inference, a good starting point usually pro-
vides a superior opportunity to converge to a good result and
vice versa. Moreover, once we have already fallen into a steady
state or an attracting basin, subsequent data may have less in-
ﬂuence on the ﬁnal result, since it may be difﬁcult to jump away
from the local attractor. By contrast, at early stages, this inﬂu-
ence may be vital to the ﬁnal inference result. Heuristically, the
importance of a certain sample may be determined by the con-
nectivity of the deleted gene. If it has many connections to other
genes, it may likely play an important role in the network, which
would be reﬂected in the measurement value (e. g. ﬁtness). Based
on this approach, the feeding order for a sample is related to the
importance or connectivity of the corresponding deleted gene,
which could be quantiﬁed by using correlation as a metric.
Speciﬁcally, we consider ﬁtness observations x(k),
k = 1, 2, . . . ,M = L - N, where L is a positive integer represent-
ing the total rounds of experiments. Note that without loss of

generality, we can always assume that x(lN + i), l: 0, ...,L,
i=1, ...,N is the 1 +1 round ﬁtness data for gene 1'. The
score S(n) for gene 11 = 1, . . . ,N is calculated as:
L—1 N
S(n) = Z Z x(lN+n)x(i), (9)
[=0 i=1;i;£n

with gene feeding arranged in the order of descending |S(n)|. The
summation over i calculates the correlation under round I. The
ﬁnal score is the summation over all rounds. This approach may
be compared with choosing the feeding order randomly, as will
be done later using concrete examples.

Finally, note that a similar feeding heuristic may be used to
optimize the order of individual experimental conditions as well.
The utility of this additional step, however, needs to be weight
against the diminished signiﬁcance of individual permutations
among observation data points as the number of conditions be-
comes large as well as the increasing computational overhead this
may entail. As in our applications the number of conditions was
substantially greater than either the number of genes or the
number of connections between them, we found the additional
computational costs such extra step would entail to be
unwarranted.

3 THE UNSCENTED KALMAN FILTER APPROACH
FOR INFERENCE

In the previous section, we proposed a system model for describ-
ing gene regulatory networks at the state—space level. The ap-
proach now requires an algorithm for estimating the unknown
parameters of the model, from which network organization
and other biological system properties may be inferred. Here, a

Kalman ﬁlter technique—a well-characterized estimation strat-
egy for elucidating state-space models of regulatory networks
WVang et al., 2006, 2009), and speciﬁcally, an unscented
Kalman ﬁlter (UKF)—is used to accomplish this task. UKF is
used to estimate all the parameters in order to cope with the
expected non-linearity of the model (Julier and Uhlmann,
1997), as it has been shown to have superior performance
when compared with traditional approaches, such as the ex-
tended Kalman ﬁlter, especially with availability of enough data.

Classical Kalman ﬁlter technique iteratively uses innovations
in state and measurement predictions—updating the system se-
quentially (Simon, 2006). The general idea of a Kalman ﬁlter can
be summarized as:

Estimation of states 2 (prediction for state) 10
+ lC(k)(residue of prediction for measurement), ( )
where [C(k) is the ‘gain’ for the residue. The original approach by
Kalman is based on linear differential equation model under
Gaussian noise assumption. An extended Kalman ﬁlter (EKF)
has been proposed for dealing with non-linear models
(Corigliano and Mariani, 2004). The idea of EKF is to linearize
the non-linear function by approximating it with the ﬁrst-order
Taylor expansion. However, such an approximation is quite
coarse and insufﬁcient under general circumstances. Some
approaches look to remedying the situation by using
higher-order terms Taylor expansion terms, which—while more
accurate—generally leads to dramatic increases in complexity
(Daum, 2005). Alternatively, UKF approximates the non-linear
function by viewing it as a non-linear transform and then using
the so—called ‘sigma points’ to capture the posterior mean and
covariance accurately up to the third order. Compared with
EKF, UKF provides a more accurate approximation without
signiﬁcant increase in complexity and has been shown superior
in many practical situations (Wan and Van Der Merwe, 2000).
Another advantage of UKF is that it does not require the cal-
culation of model’s J acobian or Hessian, which makes the algo-
rithm and associated mathematical derivations less involved (see
more below).

As noted, the UKF is based on the idea of choosing sigma
points from the unscented transform. Consider a random vector
x being passed through a non-linear transform y = h(x). In order
to calculate the mean and variance of y, we choose the sigma
points 8,, i = 0, . . . , 2R and their weights Wi as follows:

80 = E(X)9

8,- : E(x) + (1/(L+)»)Var(x)),- i: 1, ...,R,
8,- : E(x) — (1/(L +A)Var(x))i_R i: R+ 1, ...,2R,

 

A
W‘m)=—,
0 L+A (11)

where Var(x) is the variance matrix of the random variable x; ()1-
denotes the i-th column of the input matrix; A = a2(R + 1c) — R
is the scaling parameter; and ,6 is a parameter incorporating prior

knowledge of x. Under Gaussian noise assumption, we can set
IC = 0, ,6 = 2, and 01 = 10—3 (Julier and Uhlmann, 1997).

After computing all the sigma points 8 = {8,- 1230 and their
corresponding weights, the mean and variance of y can be
approximated as:

2R i=0 (12)

In order to infer the dynamical system model described in (8),
we simply concatenate the state variable y with the noise vectors
W and V to form a new augmented vector

ya(k) = [yT(k), WTHC), V(k)]T- (13)

Viewing the Fk(-) and f(-) in (8) as non-linear transforms
allows us to calculate the corresponding sigma points as well
as to approximate their mean and variance for use in sequential
updates.

We summarize the UKF-based algorithm for inferring model
(8) from knockout ﬁtness data in Section S1 of the
Supplementary Material.

4.1 Inference of synthetic network

In this section, we investigate the performance of the proposed
algorithm for inference of a synthetic network. The network has
both linear and non-linear connections with the graph structure
speciﬁed in Figure 1. The dynamics of the network are based on
the proposed model (8), with arrows denoting the direction of
regulatory interactions. The parameters of the network are given
in Table 1, with the variance of the model noise w(k) taken as
R(k) = 0.021 for k = 1, 2, . . ., where I is the identity matrix. We
also take the variance of measurement noise (error)
v(k), k = 1, 2, . . . in (1) to be 0.08. The deletion data are obtained
by sequentially removing each gene and its corresponding con-
nections. We use 10 rounds of sample data, i.e. k = 1, 2, . . . , 50.
Finally, ﬁve basis functions are included in the ﬁtness model.
(Although there is always a trade-off between accuracy and com-
plexity for number of basis functions to be used the dimension of
the problem is proportional to the number of basis functions.
The number of basis functions may be chosen quantitatively, if
needed—cg. by cross-validation—but here ﬁve basis functions
appears to be sufﬁcient.) The ﬁtness function model f(-) in (5),
thus becomes:

f(8) = Zea-«N llg — g.- ll), (14)

where ¢(r) = Jf—r, with 01 = 0.5, cz = 0.7, C3 = 1, C4 = 0.3,

g3 =(1,1,0,1,1), g4 = (1,1,1,0,1) and g5 = (1,1,1,1,0).
Following the proposed algorithm, we ﬁrst determine the ‘op-
timal’ data feeding order using the correlation score described in

Section 2.2. The resulting order is 3, 2, 1, 4, 5. We can see that
this ordering generally coincides with the importance of each

node in the sense of node connectivity. This further reafﬁrms
the validity of the proposed heuristic that the data from most
connected nodes should be fed in ﬁrst.

Following subsequent steps, we infer parameters of the under-
lying network, which are then ﬁltered to remove values below
noise threshold set at 40% of their maximal variation (0.431 and
0.443 for linear and non-linear coefﬁcients, respectively). The
resulting inferred synthetic network is shown in Figure 2, with
regulatory interaction parameters given in Table 1.

Comparing the inferred network to the true model, we can see
that the elucidated results correctly identify the presence of ﬁve
out of six regulatory interactions and suggest one non-existent
one (false negative rate of 16.7% and false positive rate of 8%,
respectively, accounting for the direction of regulation). If we
account for both linear and non-linear connections individually,
a further two connections are not discovered (linear 3 to 1 and
non-linear 3 to 2).

Finally, we have compared the effect of choosing the feeding
order according to the prescription provided in Section 2.2 versus
selecting it randomly. As can be seen in Figure 3, using the ori-
ginal order 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 instead of the optimal one 3, 2, 1, 4, 5
results in a signiﬁcant degradation of inference results.

To quantify this effect more rigorously, we deﬁne missing rate
M as the difference between 1 and the ratio of the number of
correctly identiﬁed edges to the total number of edges in the
synthetic network, i.e. 12 here. We also deﬁne false rate .7: as
the ratio of number of incorrectly identiﬁed edges to the total
number of edges not in the synthetic network, i.e. 228 here. Then,
for the inference result using the optimal order, we have
M = 0.333 and .7: = 0.00877. In contrast, using the original
order yields, M = 0.583 and .7: = 0.0175.

Table 2 summarizes the results when using the optimal order

the optimal order has performed better than randomly chosen
orders in both the missing and false rates.

4.2 Inference of S.cerevisiae GAL network

We now apply the described inference algorithm to GAL regu-
latory network that controls galactose utilization in yeast
Saccharomyces cerevisiae. GAL regulation represents one of the
most historically prominent model systems in yeast because of its
importance for the studies of eukaryotic regulation and relatively
self-contained nature. Figure 4 summarizes the empirical know-
ledge of GAL network structure (Egriboz et al., 2011; Flick and
Johnston, 1990; Johnston et al., 1994; Lohr et al., 1995;
Ostergaard et al., 2000).

 

Fig. 4. Structure of the empirical GAL network

 

Fig. 5. Linear structure of the inferred GAL network

Our analysis is based on yeast deletion strains ﬁtness data
previously collected by Giaever and co-workers (Giaever et al.,
2002). The one-dimensional measurements were performed
under various environmental conditions—such as different con-
centrations of galactose, alkali, sodium chloride, sorbitol, etc. We
utilize nine sets of samples from different environmental condi-
tions for network inference using the described algorithm, with
40% variation threshold as before. The nine sets of samples are
formed by combining arbitrary samples from each environmen-
tal condition as representatives. Figures 5 and 6 show the
inferred network graph structures as identiﬁed by linear and
non-linear coefﬁcients, respectively. A combined linear—
non-linear network graph is given in Figure 7 (note, in the inter-
est of clarity, edge weight labels and lower-weight edges have
been removed).

It could be seen from Figures 5 and 6 that GAL I, 3, 4 and 80
have the most connections and the largest coefﬁcients, which is in
accord with the known fact that these are the regulatory genes in
the network, with others being regarded as the structural genes.
Additionally, we note that GAL 80 has negative connections to
GAL 3 and GAL 4 as well as that GAL 4 has negative connec-
tions to GAL I and 7, all of which coincides with the empirically
known fact that GAL 80 negatively regulates GAL 3, 4 and that
GAL 4 leads to the repression of transcription from GAL I, 7.
The connections between GAL I, 2 and GAL 3 also reﬂect the
fact that GAL 2 and GAL I regulate GAL 3 by protein utilization
pathway. Finally, we see that there is no direct connection from

GAL II to GAL 80, which also coincides with the fact that
GAL 11 does not have direct interaction with GAL 80. On the
other hand, we ﬁnd that although inference results discover the
connections between GAL 3 and GAL 80 as well as GAL 3 and
GAL 4, they may not be in the correct orientation. Otherwise,
inferred inﬂuences among regulatory genes appear to be in a
general agreement with empirical understanding of the system.

4.3 Inference of Shewanella T yrR—LiuR network

In this section, we apply our algorithm to the T yrR—LiuR amino
acid utilization—degradation network of S.0neidensis strain
MR—l. Its ‘true’ structure, shown in Figure 8, was derived
from hand-curated high-conﬁdence regulatory interactions cata-
logued at MicrobesOnline and RegPrecise (Dehal et al., 2009;
Novichkov et al., 2010). Inference was performed by using the
proposed algorithm on 287 sets of ﬁtness data (number of ﬁtness
measurements for each of the knockout strains under different
growth conditions), with results shown in Figures 9 and 10. The
inference results are compared to and seen to be in general cor-
respondence with the true structure, Table 3.

5 DISCUSSION

We have proposed a dynamical model and an algorithm for
inference of gene regulatory networks based on genome-wide

knockout ﬁtness data—an emerging data type, whose utility in
biological systems identiﬁcation has not been sufﬁciently
explored to date. The algorithm uses a state—space model to
capture the dynamical and non-linear nature of such networks.
An unscented Kalman ﬁlter is used to infer the unknown par-
ameters in order to cope with model non-linearity.

Network inference from fitness data

 

Although ﬁtness data inherently suffers from loss of informa-
tion caused by its reduced dimensionality, when compared with
the more widely explored gene expression data type, the poten-
tially larger amounts of and more contextually/phenotypically
meaningful data provided may be able to compensate for the
relative lack of resolution as our work appears to suggest. The
analysis of a synthetic example as well as empirical GAL and
T yrR—LiuR network data presented here shows that the
described algorithm is able to provide satisfying inference results
even for relatively complex mechanisms.

Ultimately, the two data types—gene expression and knockout
ﬁtness—may be expected to be most informative when used in a
complementary fashion. As noted previously, inferences gener-
ated from genome-wide knockout ﬁtness data could be used to
facilitate network elucidation methods based on gene expression
by helping initialize or further reﬁne their predictions.
Conversely, information provided by gene expression data may
be exploited by the proposed algorithm in conjunction with
knockout ﬁtness data to synergistically improve ﬁnal inference
results. For instance, gene expression data may be collected
under a more limited set of conditions, for a subset of the
mutant library, or just for the wild-type strain; and used for
the initial inference of an augmented state vector
y(k) = [gT (k), AT , BT , IT , ,uT ]T—associated only with the gene
expression part of the model, Equations (1)—(4). Such prelimin-
ary results could then be used as a prior for the subsequent net-
work inference round, which uses genome-wide ﬁtness data in
order to take advantage of its potentially larger scale or more
immediate availability across a range of conditions, as well as to
introduce corresponding phenotypically signiﬁcant reﬁnements
(as discussed earlier).

Several other directions appear promising toward potentially
further extending and improving the inference methodology pro-
posed here. F or instance, the non-linear univariate interaction
model, Equation (2), may be augmented with explicitly multi-
variate terms. This should serve to enhance resolution of
non-linear interactions for a given gene across multiple reaction
partners and improve modelling accuracy, though at a cost of
substantial computational overhead owing to complications
related to multiplicative noise propagation and the need to ac-
count for intermediate molecular complexes. Perhaps a more
straightforward approach involves using the model to accommo-
date multiple—knockout experiments (i.e. those involving multiple
inactivated genes in each strain). This is done analogously to the
way single-knockout networks have been analyzed here by
simply setting all of the corresponding interaction term coefﬁ-
cients to zero for the genes in question. The reason we have
focused less on such applications in this work, however, is the
present scarcity of multiple— versus single-knockout observation
data. Finally, additional constraints could be incorporated to
help account for other pre-existing sources of experimental or
heuristic information. For example, we have noted earlier the
possibility of applying feed optimization schemes to condition
data ordering. One may further look at various sparseness con-
ditions as a way of improving computational efﬁciency and
incorporating pre-existing knowledge about the network during
inference. [Though, care should be taken, as signiﬁcant vari-
ations in effective regulatory network topology may naturally
arise across experimental conditions or in going from one related

organism to another (Bergrnann et al., 2003; Luscombe et al.,
2004)]

Overall, we believe that these questions help further support
the suggestion that the analysis of genome-wide ﬁtness data
(whether directly or in conjunction with gene expression data)
towards understanding of biological systems function and, in
particular, inference of gene regulatory network organization
offers a rich new area of future research—to which this article
is seeking to make an initial contribution.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Knowledge of pathogen—host protein interactions is
required to better understand infection mechanisms. The pathogen—
host interaction search tool (PHISTO) is a web-accessible platform
that provides relevant information about pathogen—host interactions
(PHIs). It enables access to the most up-to-date PHI data for all patho-
gen types for which experimentally verified protein interactions with
human are available. The platform also offers integrated tools for visu-
alization of PHI networks, graph—theoretical analysis of targeted
human proteins, BLAST search and text mining for detecting missing
experimental methods. PHISTO will facilitate PHI studies that provide
potential therapeutic targets for infectious diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

The interactions between the proteins of infectious microorgan-
isms, pathogens and their human hosts allow the microorganisms
to manipulate human cellular mechanisms to their own advan-
tage, resulting in infection in the host organism. The recent ad-
vances in high-throughput protein interaction detection methods
have led to the production of large-scale interspecies protein—
protein interaction (PPI) data of pathogen—human systems.
Currently, there are a number of pathogen—host interaction
(PHI) resources that are speciﬁc to some pathogens. The only
available resource to access all PHI data in a single database
(Kumar and Nanduri, 2010) does not offer any additional func-
tionality to analyze PHI networks. We have developed pathogen—
host interaction search tool (PHISTO) to serve as an up-to-date
and functionally enhanced source of PHI data through a user-
friendly interface. PHIs in PHISTO are imported from several
PPI databases using the PSICQUIC tool (Aranda et al., 2011).
Text mining is used to label PHIs extracted without any informa-
tion on interaction detection method. Tools for visualization of
small PHI networks and graph—theoretical analysis of targeted

human proteins may enable users to gain crucial insights on in-
fection mechanisms. The BLAST interface offers to search for
orthologous PHIs for pathogens lacking experimental data.

2 ARCHITECTURE

PHISTO is designed as a Web-accessible platform with two-tier
architecture. The back tier is a MySQL-based database. The
front tier is a PHP- and J avascript-based user interface that
runs on an Apache Web server. Figure 1 illustrates the architec-
ture of PHISTO.

2.1 Database

The PSICQUIC tool is used to extract PHI data from nine data-
bases (see Section A in Supplementary Material). To present
protein interaction data in a consistent format, Uniprot IDs
and names of interacting proteins, taxonomy IDs and names
of pathogens, experimental methods and PubMed IDs of
literature references are collected; the data are stored in separate
database tables, with one PHI table containing the core data
(UniProt IDs, Taxonomy ID, Experimental Method, PubMed
ID) and the others being mostly ID—related tables (see Section B
in Supplementary Material). Thanks to the implementation of
ID—based core data, standardized data formats and relational
data tables, the PHISTO database can easily be maintained
and enhanced. It is automatically updated by our J ava-based
ofﬂine application on a monthly basis. Currently, PHISTO
stores data on 23 661 PHIs between human and 300 pathogen
strains (247 viral, 45 bacterial, 3 fungal and 5 protozoan).
Among the PHI data extracted from the PPI databases, there
were 12 751 PHI data that were not labeled with the experimental
methods used to detect these interactions. PHISTO contains a
text mining module for experimental method extraction for such
data. A dictionary of interaction detection methods is compiled
from the PSI-MI ontology. The abstracts of the articles that
contain PHIs without experimental method information are ob-
tained from PubMed. An exact string matching-based approach
was used to assign 2952 experimental method names to 2109
unique PHIs. The experimental method detection module was
evaluated by using the PHIs with experimental method informa-
tion in PHISTO. The module achieved a promising precision of
74%. The recall and the F -score of the module are 34 and 47%,
respectively (see Section C in Supplementary Material).

2.2 User interface

The functional and easy-to-use Web-based user interface pro-
vides various search, browse and data analysis options. The
‘Quick Search’ option is for performing a query without a spe-
ciﬁed identiﬁer, whereas the ‘Advanced Search’ option can be
used to search based on any selected subset of identiﬁers (i.e.
taxonomy ID and name of pathogen, Uniprot ID and name of
pathogen protein, Uniprot ID and name of human protein, ex-
perimental method and literature reference). The ‘Browse’ option
provides users with easy access to the entire PHI data of any
speciﬁed pathogen within the taxonomical classiﬁcation. The
PHI search results are presented in a clear and consistent ID-
based formatted table, which includes information about the
eight identiﬁers mentioned previously. Proteins, pathogens and
publications listed in the results are linked to external databases
UniProt, NCBI Taxonomy and PubMed, respectively, offering
users quick navigation in these informative databases. The search
results can be exported to a variety of ﬁle formats. The visual-
ization option allows the resulting PHI network to be repre-
sented as a bipartite graph. Statistics of search results can be
visualized through pie or bar charts, describing the distribution
of PHIs over the types, families, species and strains of pathogens.
For a protein of interest, one can search for homolog pathogen
proteins in PHISTO using the ‘BLAST’ interface (see Section D
in Supplementary Material). Finally, the ‘Graph Analysis’ inter-
face provides the degree and betweenness centrality distributions
of the targeted human proteins compared with all proteins within
the human intranetwork (see Section E in Supplementary
Material).

3 DISCUSSION

With regular monthly data updates and complete coverage of
all data available for each pathogen type, PHISTO will always
provide uniﬁed access to up-to-date PHI data. Otherwise,

gathering such information would require careful and tedious
data integration. To our knowledge, PHISTO is the ﬁrst PHI
tool that uses text mining to identify the interaction detection
methods of PHIs that have not been originally annotated with
such information. Additionally, PHI results visualized as a bi-
partite graph allow users to capture PHI mechanisms (i.e. most
connected pathogen/host proteins can be easily observed at a
glance). The sequence search option, BLAST, makes it possible
to retrieve homologous PHIs. After homolog pathogen proteins
in PHISTO are found, interacting human protein partners of the
homolog proteins may be assigned as putative interactors for the
protein under investigation. Finally, the distributions of degree
and betweenness centrality values in the graph analysis tool give
crucial insights on attacking strategies of pathogens during
infections (Dyer et al., 2008; Durmus Tekir et al., 2012). Our
goal with PHISTO is to provide a centralized and up-to-date
platform for studying pathogen—host protein interaction systems
with future curation of PHIs from literature by text mining and
additional advanced analysis tools for PHI networks.

Abstract

Motivation: It has recently become possible to build reliable de novo models of proteins if a mul—
tiple sequence alignment (MSA) of at least 1000 homologous sequences can be built. Methods of
global statistical network analysis can explain the observed correlations between columns in the
MSA by a small set of directly coupled pairs of columns. Strong couplings are indicative of resi—
due—residue contacts, and from the predicted contacts a structure can be computed. Here, we ex—
ploit the structural regularity of paired ﬁ—strands that leads to characteristic patterns in the noisy
matrices of couplings. The ﬁ—ﬁ contacts should be detected more reliably than single contacts,
reducing the required number of sequences in the MSAs.

Results: bbcontacts predicts ﬁ—ﬁ contacts by detecting these characteristic patterns in the 2D map
of coupling scores using two hidden Markov models (HMMs), one for parallel and one for antiparal—
lel contacts. ﬁ—bulges are modelled as indel states. In contrast to existing methods, bbcontacts uses
predicted instead of true secondary structure. On a standard set of 916 test proteins, 34% of which
have MSAs with < 1000 sequences, bbcontacts achieves 50% precision for contacting ﬁ—ﬁ residue
pairs at 50% recall using predicted secondary structure and 64% precision at 64% recall using true
secondary structure, while existing tools achieve around 45% precision at 45% recall using true
secondary structure.

1 Introduction

 

Methods for protein structure prediction can be classified into tem—
plate—based and de novo methods. The first group model the struc—
ture for a query protein based on a sequence alignment with a
homologous template protein of known structure. This class of
methods is by far the most widely used for its speed and reliability.
Many protein families lack a 3D template, and therefore much effort
has been invested into developing methods for de novo protein
structure prediction.

The most successful de novo prediction methods, such as
ROSETTA (Leaver—Fay et 61]., 2011), are based on complex,

knowledge—based scoring functions and structural fragment assem—
bly. Even though in roughly a quarter of the cases the top methods
can produce models with the correct fold (Tai et 61]., 2014), their
practical usefulness is severely limited by the difficulty of predicting
which models are correct.

An alternative de novo approach relies on the observation that
correlated mutations between pairs of multiple sequence alignment
(MSA) columns could predict physical contacts between residues
(Gobel et 61]., 1994). Furthermore, it was realized that only few cor—
rectly predicted residue—residue contacts (~10% of the number of
residues) are sufficient to predict the correct protein fold (Kim et 61].,

2014; Skolnick et 61]., 1997). However, it was only recently that stat—
istical methods were applied to the MSAs that could distinguish dir—
ect couplings between MSA columns from mere transitive
correlations (Marks et 61]., 2011; Weigt et 61]., 2009). This allowed
for the first time the reliable de novo prediction of structures for
proteins with many homologs (Marks et 61]., 2011; Hopf et 61].,
2012; Nugent and Jones, 2012). In the past few years, these methods
have been further improved by applying different approaches of dir—
ect coupling analysis (Ekeberg et 61]., 2013; Jones et 61]., 2012;
Kamisetty et 61]., 2013). Yet, obtaining reliable structural models re—
quires large numbers of homologous sequences, still severely limit—
ing the scope of these methods.

Here, our goal is to increase the reliability of contact predictions
by detecting patterns in the matrix of predicted couplings corres—
ponding to interactions between secondary structure elements. We
focus on the case of ﬂ—ﬂ contacts because of their strongly con—
strained spatial arrangement. ﬂ—sheets are composed of regularly
arranged pairs of interacting ﬂ—strands. The interaction between two
extended ﬂ—strands is defined on the basis of regular patterns of
hydrogen bonds, connecting residues in two different strands in ei—
ther a parallel or an antiparallel fashion (Kabsch and Sander, 1983).
The prediction of contacts between ﬂ—residues has applications in
protein design (Kortemme, 1998; Smith and Regan, 1995), in the
study of folding characteristics (Kamat and Lesk, 2007; Merkel and
Regan, 2000) and in de novo protein structure prediction (Klepeis
and Floudas, 2003; Ruczinski et 61]., 2002). According to a recent
study, while direct contact predictions have similar average preci—
sion for mainly-or and mainly—ﬂ proteins, the structural models ob—
tained using these predictions as restraints are more accurate for
mainly-or proteins (Michel et 61]., 2014).

A variety of methods have been developed for the prediction of ﬂ—ﬂ
contacts. An early method used statistical potentials for pairs of interact—
ing ﬂ—strand residues (Hubbard, 1994). Baldi et al. (2000) were the first
to predict ﬂ—ﬂ contacts with neural networks. Cheng and Baldi (2005)
introduced the important idea of exploiting the topology of ﬂ—sheets in
their BetaPro method by filtering out the solutions incompatible with
the specific geometry of ﬂ—sheets. In MLN and MLN—ZS, Lippi and
Frasconi (2009) used Markov logic networks to incorporate structure—
based constraints directly into the learning process.

Two recent methods use correlated mutation signatures to pre—
dict ﬂ—sheets. CMM (Burkoff et 61]., 2013) integrates these with a
ﬂ—topology model. BCov (Savojardo et 61]., 2013) processes predicted
coupling scores with integer programming to enforce topological
constraints. CMM, BCov and MLN—ZS display the best ﬂ—ﬂ contact
prediction performances so far (Savojardo et 61]., 2013).

Finally, some methods aiming to predict all protein contacts (not
only ﬂ—ﬂ contacts) also use topological information, in particular
related to ﬂ—sheet organization: CMAPpro (Di Lena et al., 2012),
PhyCMAP (Wang and Xu, 2013), PconsC2 (Skwark et 61]., 2014).
PconsC2 reports the highest contact prediction accuracies to date. It
takes direct coupling scores from the PconsC meta—predictor as in—
put and trains random forests on local 11 X 11 windows in the cou—
pling matrix to predict the contact state of the central cell.

Existing ﬂ—ﬂ contact prediction methods have used known in—
stead of predicted secondary structure. It is unclear, however, how
they would perform in practice when substituting true with pre—
dicted secondary structure. Here, we describe a method to predict
ﬂ—ﬂ contacts that, even though it makes use of predicted instead of
true secondary structure, achieves better performance than previous
methods. We designed two hidden Markov models (HMMs) for
parallel and antiparallel ﬂ—ﬂ contacts that integrate signals from the
predicted couplings and the predicted secondary structure.

2 Methods

2.1 General approach

Similar to contact maps or distance maps, which can be used to de—
scribe a protein structure or compare two structures (Holm and
Sander, 1996), direct coupling predictions can be mapped on a two—
dimensional grid. Each cell in the resulting matrix contains the
strength of the predicted coupling, indicating whether the two cor—
responding positions in the protein are reliably predicted to be in
direct physical contact. We call such representations ‘matrices of
predicted couplings’ or simply ‘coupling matrices’.

Interactions between ﬂ—strands create conspicuous patterns in
the coupling matrices, linked to the regularity of their 3D structural
arrangement. Figure 1a shows a coupling matrix for a domain of
PDB structure 3dk9, with four highlighted antiparallel ﬂ—ﬂ contacts.
A schematic antiparallel pattern is displayed in Figure 1c together
with a diagram showing the corresponding contacts between
ﬂ—residues. In short, ﬂ—strand interactions create a diagonal stretch
of strong couplings between the closest residues. This stretch is per—
pendicular (respectively parallel) to the diagonal of the coupling ma—
trix for antiparallel (respectively parallel) ﬂ—strands. Most often,
given a contact between residues 1' and j on this main diagonal,
increased couplings can also be observed between i and j: 2 and
between j and ii 2, as the corresponding side—chains are close in
space and point in the same direction. Such couplings form ‘second—
ary diagonals’ on both sides of the main diagonal of the pattern.

Interactions between ﬂ—strands are very regular, but ﬂ—bulges con—
stitute a frequent type of irregularity disrupting the regular alternation
of side—chain direction (Chan et 61]., 1993; Craveur et 61]., 2013;
Richardson et 61]., 1978). The most frequent ﬂ—bulges arise from the
insertion of a residue between successive hydrogen bonds connecting
two ﬂ—strands. Such ﬂ—bulges induce a shift in the main diagonal of
the pattern by one position, as illustrated in Figure 1d. In some rarer
cases, a ﬂ—bulge can arise from the insertion of one residue on each
ﬂ—strand (so that the main diagonal of the pattern is not shifted) or
from the insertion of more than one residue on one ﬂ—strand (so that
the main diagonal of the pattern is shifted by more than one position).

To detect the patterns created by ﬂ—ﬂ contacts, we designed the
HMM architecture shown in Figure 2. In contrast to most HMMs
used in bioinformatics applications (e.g. transmembrane helix pre-
dictions), our HMM detects patterns in a 2D map and not in a 1D
sequence or 1D sequence profile. The nine hidden states circled in
Figure 2 represent different types of interactions between pairs of
ﬂ—residues. The ‘first’ and ‘last’ states represent the first and last
non—bulge residue—residue contacts. The ‘internal’ state is the main
HMM state and ﬂ—ﬂ contact predictions can be extended to any
length by looping through this state. ﬂ—bulges correspond to indels
in HMMs used for pairwise sequence alignment. We only take into
account ﬂ—bulges inducing a shift in the pattern and this shift is
achieved through the transition from bulge £0 to bulge i1 or from
bulge jo to bulge 1'1. All HMM transitions except those between two
bulge states correspond to a diagonal (respectively antidiagonal) dis—
placement for parallel (respectively antiparallel) ﬂ—ﬂ contacts. Bulge
states i2 and ['2 allow for the insertion of two residues in the same
ﬂ—bulge; we do not allow for the insertion of more than two resi-
dues. The ‘start’ and ‘end’ states are added for modelling both ends
of the contact between two extended ﬂ—strands. Figures 1c and d
show coupling patterns with annotated HMM states.

The same HMM architecture is used for parallel and antiparallel
ﬂ—ﬂ contacts, but two different sets of HMM parameters are trained
(Section 2.5) and the direction of HMM decoding is diagonal for
parallel contacts and antidiagonal for antiparallel ones.

frequently observed transitions and dashed arrows represent rare transitions.
For the HMM detecting parallel (respectively, antiparallel) contacts, most tran-
sitions correspond to a diagonal (respectively, antidiagonal) displacement in
the coupling matrix, except the transitions between bulge istates (transitions
along the j axis with iremaining fixed, such as the one displayed in Fig. 1d)
and the transitions between bulge jstates (transitions along the iaxis with j
remaining fixed). A [i-bulge involves at least one (and at most two) inserted
residue(s) on one of the two strands, thus state bulge i0 can only be followed
by bulge i1 (same for bulge jo —> bulge M

The observed variables are the real—valued predicted couplings as
well as the predicted secondary structure states (or the true second—
ary structure states assigned by DSSP (Kabsch and Sander, 1983),
when used in order to compare our method with existing ones). The
HMM emission probabilities consequently include a product of con—
tinuous emissions accounting for the observed couplings (including
signals from the main diagonal and the secondary diagonals of the
pattern) and discrete emissions accounting for the discrete secondary
structure states (H, E and C). These emissions are described in more
detail in Section 2.5 .

A path (sequence of states) traced by the HMM through the
coupling matrix corresponds to a contact between two extended
ﬂ—strands. Each state within the path corresponds to an interaction
between two ﬂ—residues. We want to detect all patterns in the cou—
pling matrix corresponding to parallel and antiparallel ﬂ—strand con—
tacts. To this effect, we use a local version of the Viterbi algorithm,

so that we can predict several paths that can start and end anywhere
in the coupling matrix. The Viterbi score associated to a path meas—
ures the confidence of the corresponding prediction. We rank the
paths by decreasing Viterbi score and retain all paths (above a given
threshold) which satisfy the topological constraints associated with
ﬂ—strand pairings.

In the following sections, we describe the training and bench—
marking of bbcontacts.

2.2 Datasets

To compare our method with existing ones, two previously pub—
lished test datasets were used. The BetaSheet916 dataset (Cheng and
Baldi, 2005) has been routinely used as a benchmark dataset for ﬂ—ﬂ
contact prediction. It is also our main test dataset. It consists of 916
protein chains containing 31 638 ﬂ—residue contacts. Savojardo et al.
(2013) recently proposed a complementary dataset, built from more
recent structures. This new dataset, BetaSheet1452, consists of 1452
protein chains containing 56 552 ﬂ—residue contacts. The two test
datasets are non—redundant at 20% sequence identity, both intern-
ally and with each other.

Our training dataset was built from the CATH database of pro—
tein domains v3.5 (Sillitoe et 61]., 2013). The building process aimed
to reduce as much as possible the redundancy between the training
dataset and both test datasets at the fold (CATH Topology) level.
We extracted all CATH domains that did not belong to any of the
fold groups identified by CATH in the test datasets. We filtered the
resulting dataset to reduce internal redundancy, using the HH—suite
script pdbfilter . pl (Remmert et 61]., 2011). Finally, 943 domains
containing ﬂ—contacts form our training dataset (Supplementary
Dataset S1). Because not all chains from the test datasets were anno—
tated in CATH v3.5, there might be some residual redundancy be—
tween the training dataset and the test datasets. We checked that
this did not lead to overtraining of bbcontacts, by verifying that the
results did not deteriorate when taking the subset of each test dataset
that is strictly non—redundant with the training dataset at the fold
level (see Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure S1).

All ﬂ—contacts were assigned based on backbone contacts, fol—
lowing the DSSP definition (Kabsch and Sander, 1983). For both
training and testing, the DSSP assignment was reduced to three
states (B and E were mapped to E; H, I and G were mapped to H; T,
S and C were mapped to C).

ﬂ—bulges were detected by PROMOTIF (Hutchinson and
Thornton, 1996). We then filtered the detected ﬂ—bulges to retain
only those inducing a shift of the main diagonal in the direct cou—
pling pattern (see Fig. 1d).

2.3 Data used for HMM training

For the training and test datasets, we built MSAs by running
HHblits (Remmert et 61]., 2011) against the uniprot20 database
dated March 2013. Each MSA was filtered down to 90% sequence
identity with HHfilter (Remmert et 61]., 2011). Supplementary
Figure S2 shows the distribution of the number of sequences in the
resulting MSAs for each dataset.

Secondary structure predictions were obtained with PSIPRED
(Jones, 1999), using the HH—suite script addss .pl for improved
performance (Remmert et 61]., 2011). Direct coupling predictions
were obtained with CCMpred (Seemayer et 61]., 2014), a fast imple—
mentation of the state—of—the—art methods by Kamisetty et al. (2013)
and Ekeberg et al. (2013).

We observed that the range of predicted couplings varied greatly
depending on the number of sequences N in the MSA and the pro—
tein length L. We found that 17 : \/_I\I / L was a good descriptor for
the range of couplings observed in a predicted matrix. For each do—
main in the training dataset, we filtered the initial MSA in order to
build MSAs of reduced diversity, using the qsc parameter of
HHfilter (Remmert et 61]., 2011). We derived 12 datasets for 17
: 0.05,0.1,0.2,...,1.0,1.2 (see Supplementary Table S1). We ran
CCMpred on all diversity—filtered alignments and used the resulting
coupling matrices to train the coupling—based part of the HMM
emission probabilities.

2.4 Local background correction of the coupling
matrices

The coupling matrices sometimes display darker regions that can
lead to many false positive predictions (Supplementary Figure 83a).
We therefore applied the following local background correction pro—
cedure to all coupling matrices in the training and test datasets:
from each coupling, we subtracted the average coupling over an
area of size (25 —I— 1) X (25 —I— 1), extending by S cells in each direction.
For single domains with a good alignment coverage (including most
domains in the training dataset), this procedure has almost no effect
on the coupling values (Supplementary Figure S3b).

2.5 HMM parameters

The HMMs were trained using the labeled data contained in the
training dataset. We trained two sets of HMM parameters separ—
ately for parallel and antiparallel ﬂ—strand pairings. We did not train
bbcontacts for the detection of ﬂ—bridges, because we do not expect
the residues involved in isolated ﬂ—bridges to be generally predicted
as ﬂ—residues by PSIPRED, and because the coupling signals typically
do not form patterns for such isolated ﬂ—contacts.

The HMM transition probabilities were trained by counting
how many times each transition was used in the training dataset.
The HMM emission probabilities contain a product of two terms,
one based on couplings and one based on secondary structure (from
either PSIPRED predictions or DSSP assignments). Each term is ex—
pressed as the odds—ratio of the conditional distribution of the

observed variables when in one of the HMM states, relative to the
background distribution.

2.5.1 Coupling-based emissions

The coupling—based part of the emission probability at position (i, 1')
was expressed as the product of three odds—ratios relative to the
background: one for the central coupling at position (i, j) belonging
to the main diagonal of the pattern and one for each of the two cou—
plings at the positions adjacent to (i, j) belonging to the secondary
diagonals of the pattern [Supplementary Equations (1)—(4)]. This is
illustrated in Figure 1c: the dotted lines delineate the three couplings
entering into the emission probability calculations for cell (i=6,
i=2), at positions (1', j), (i— 1, j— 1) and (i—I— 1, j—I— 1). These adja—
cent cells are chosen rather than (i, ji2) and (ii2, j) to avoid mul-
tiple counting.

Because of data scarcity, we did not distinguish between different
HMM states and bundled all ﬂ—contacts together for this stage of the
training. For each decoding direction (parallel and antiparallel), we
thus had to describe three coupling distributions: one for the back—
ground, one for the main diagonal of the patterns and one for the
secondary diagonals of the patterns.

After centering the coupling distributions at zero, we fitted their
density using two transformed Gamma distributions, one for posi—
tive couplings and one for negative couplings. To describe the dens—
ity fit for a given value of 17, we used seven parameters: the shift
needed to center the coupling distribution, the relative weight of the
positive and negative sides, plus two transformed Gamma param—
eters for negative couplings and three for positive couplings. The
shift was fitted as a quadratic function of 17 and all remaining param-
eters were expressed as linear functions of 17. The optimization was
performed by maximum likelihood estimation. The final number of
parameters for the coupling—based emissions is 90. Details are given
in the Supplementary Methods and the final fits are illustrated in
Supplementary Figure S4.

2.5.2 Secondary-structure-based emissions

This part of the emission probabilities was trained separately for the
PSIPRED predictions and the DSSP assignments. We used a discrete
mapping of the secondary structure observations to three states (E,
H and C). In the PSIPRED case, the most probable secondary struc—
ture state was used for each position.

We denote by z an HMM state and by (a), 07) the pair of second—
ary structure states at position (i, i). We tested two types of second—
ary—structure—based emissions. The ‘non—conditional’ emissions were
defined as the set of probabilities [)(ai, o7|z), as expected from the
traditional definition of emission probabilities. However, this does
not account for the important fact that by definition, a secondary
structure element is a segment of residues immediately adjacent in
sequence. Therefore, the ‘conditional’ emissions were defined as the
set of probabilities [)(ai, o7|aipreﬂ aimeWz) of observing a pair of sec—
ondary structure states (0,, 07) in state z, given that we additionally
already observed secondary structure states (oz-prev, aiprev) at the previ—
ous position (iprev, jprev).

We also added pseudocounts derived from the non—conditional
probability distribution to the conditional probabilities: when calcu—
lating the conditional probabilities, we added N0 counts from the
non—conditional frequencies to the observed conditional counts.
This effectively interpolates between the conditional and non—condi—
tional distributions: for states with few conditional counts relative
to N0, the conditional probabilities with added pseudocounts will be

very similar to the non—conditional probabilities. Different values of
N0 were tested (see Section 3.1).

Because we found that the secondary structure states for the cou—
pling matrix cells situated immediately before and immediately after
a ﬂ—strand interaction contain information about the likelihood to
start and end this interaction, the model also contains secondary—
structure—based emission terms for the start and end states. The start
term is always a non—conditional probability and can also be seen as
a prior based on secondary structure.

In total, there are 415 parameters for the DSSP secondary—struc—
ture based emissions and 415 parameters for the PSIPRED—based
emissions [see Supplementary Methods and Supplementary
Equations (5)—(10)].

2.5.3 Prior probability distribution depending on sequence
separation

The sequence separation between two interacting ﬂ—strands has a
lower bound due to geometric considerations, especially for the par-
allel case. In addition, it is strongly biased in practice, especially for
antiparallel ﬂ—strands, a majority of which are ﬂ-hairpins for which
the two strands are separated by a short loop.

Thus, we introduced a prior for starting a ﬂ—strand interaction
depending on the sequence separation between the first pair of inter-
acting residues. This prior is based on 34 fitted parameters for
PSIPRED—based predictions and 34 fitted parameters for DSSP—
based predictions [Supplementary Equation (11) and Figure S5]. We
also introduced constraints to prevent the detection of ﬂ—contacts for
positions too close to the diagonal of the coupling matrix. More de—
tails are given in the Supplementary Methods.

2.6 HMM decoding

Following the ideas introduced by Muckstein et al. (2002) for local
sequence—sequence alignment and by Biegert and Soding (2008) for
local HMM—HMM alignment, we use a local version of the Viterbi
algorithm for decoding a matrix of predicted couplings to detect pat—
terns corresponding to ﬂ—strand interactions. We dispense with an
explicit background state by using odds—ratio emission probabilities:
each emission probability corresponding to an HMM state is always
divided by a background probability. The HMM paths can start and
end anywhere in the coupling matrix. We do not detect a single
most likely path corresponding to the best Viterbi score, but instead
all paths above a certain Viterbi score threshold.

For each position (i, j) and each state z, the Viterbi variable V [i,
j, z] is defined as the probability of ending a path at position (i, j)
and in state z. The local Viterbi algorithm consists of four major
steps: initialization, recursion, termination and back—tracing [see
Supplementary Methods, including Supplementary Equations
(12)-(14)l-

In the initialization step, the Viterbi variables V[i, 1', start] are ini—
tialized for all positions (1', j) in the coupling matrix and the priors
described above are applied. In the recursion step, all V[i,j,z] for
z ¢{start, end} are calculated using the transition and emission
probabilities. In the termination step, the V[i, 1', end] probabilities are
calculated. During recursion and termination, pointers are used to
keep track of the most likely paths.

The initialization, recursion and termination steps of the Viterbi
decoding are performed separately for the parallel and antiparallel
directions, but all V[i, 1', end] scores are then merged and sorted in
decreasing order for the final back—tracing step. The most likely
path, corresponding to the highest V[i, 1', end] probability, is
retrieved by back—tracing through the saved pointers. Then, we cross

out a region extending by i 3 residues around this path in the
Viterbi matrix corresponding to the path direction (parallel or anti-
parallel), i.e. we do not take into account any more probabilities for
this region. This avoids retrieving many variants of a contact be—
tween the same ﬂ—strands. The next path that does not contain any
crossed—out residue pairs is then saved and a region around this path
is crossed—out. We proceed iteratively in this manner until we reach
a given Viterbi score threshold.

2.6.1 Prediction-shortening mode
For PSIPRED—based results, in some cases, the Viterbi paths can be
very long because of the spatial architecture of the protein (see
Supplementary Figure S6 for an example). We designed a procedure,
called ‘PSM’ (prediction—shortening mode), to ensure that the pre—
dicted parallel paths stay below 11 residue pairs in length and the
predicted antiparallel paths below 15 residue pairs. When PSM is
triggered, it shortens the predicted paths by iteratively decreasing
the transition probabilities and rerunning the Viterbi algorithm until
the predicted paths are below the length threshold. For DSSP—based
results, such a procedure is unnecessary because the secondary—struc—
ture—based probabilities make it impossible to predict contacts be—
tween non—ﬂ—residues, so that the length of any path is limited by the
length of the longest ﬂ—strands.

More details about PSM are given in the Supplementary
Methods.

2.7 Topology filtering

When all most likely Viterbi paths have been retrieved, a final post—
processing step is applied to filter the incompatible paths given the
topological constraints that apply to ﬂ—ﬂ contacts. We go through
the list of retrieved paths sorted by decreasing Viterbi score. Each
path can be retained or excluded. A path is excluded if it contains a
residue that already has two ﬂ—partners in previously retained paths
or a residue pair that already belongs to a previous path. Using this
residue—based filtering rather than a strand—based filtering means
that bbcontacts can handle cases where a ﬂ—strand is in contact with
more than two strands, as also pointed out for previous methods
(Cheng and Baldi, 2005 ). In addition, when the DSSP assignment is
used, we can rely on the exact positions of ﬂ—strands, so we exclude
any path containing a contact between two residues from the same
ﬂ—strand or between a pair of ﬂ—strands that already belongs to a pre—
vious path.

2.8 Evaluation
Performance is measured in terms of precision and recall at the
strand level and at the residue level, as was done for previous ﬂ—ﬂ
contact prediction methods. The F1—score (harmonic mean of preci-
sion and recall) is also used, as it provides a single value to measure
the quality of the ﬂ—ﬂ contact predictions. bbcontacts is compared
with the best methods available so far: BetaPro (Cheng and Baldi,
2005 ), MLN and MLN—ZS (Lippi and Frasconi, 2009), CMM
(Burkoff et 61]., 2013) and BCov (Savojardo et 61]., 2013).
Residue—level evaluation is straightforward in all cases. Strand—
level evaluation is only straightforward for DSSP—based results. For
PSIPRED—based results, because the true ﬂ—strand positions are
unknown, additional conventions need to be adopted for the
strand—level evaluation (see Supplementary Methods). Because
PSIPRED—based strand—level evaluation is based on these additional
criteria, it is provided only in an indicative manner and the residue—
level evaluation forms the most solid basis for comparison between
different versions of our method.

bbcontacts is also compared with general contact predictors:
CCMpred (Seemayer et 61]., 2014), PhyCMAP (Wang and Xu, 2013)
and PconsC2 (Skwark et 61]., 2014). Baselines for these methods are
obtained by restricting predictions to DSSP—defined ﬂ—strand regions.
To make the comparison fairer to these methods, we exclude all
false positives with sequence separation smaller than 6 from their
predictions. True positives are unchanged (ﬂ—ﬂ contacts assigned by
DSSP).

3 Results and discussion

For the sake of simplicity, all results are shown for the BetaSheet916
test dataset. However, the trends described also hold for the training
dataset and the BetaSheet1452 test dataset (see Supplementary
Results and Supplementary Figures S21—25).

3.1 Contribution of the different terms in bbcontacts

This section illustrates how much the various steps composing the
bbcontacts method contribute to its performance. Here, the second—
ary structure predicted by PSIPRED is used as an input. This section
is focused on residue—level performance because this assessment is
more stringent.

We use a reference version of bbcontacts in which local back—
ground correction with S : 10 is applied to the coupling matrices,
the conditional secondary—structure—based emission probabilities
with N0 = 10 000 pseudocounts from the non—conditional distribu—
tion are used, the prior depending on sequence separation is used
and PSM is turned off. We then modify one element of the model at
a time and discuss the impact of each of the corresponding terms.

First of all, when developing bbcontacts, we tested ‘conditional’
and ‘non—conditional’ secondary—structure—based emission probabil—
ities (see ‘Methods’). We also tried adding pseudocounts from the
non—conditional probability distribution to the conditional probabil—
ities. This was motivated by the observation that the conditional
probabilities for some rarely observed states were derived from very
low counts; in this case, adding counts from the non—conditional dis—
tribution (for which all states are well populated) should make the
resulting probabilities more robust. However, we found an optimal
number of pseudocounts N0 of 10 000 on the training dataset (see
Supplementary Figure S7), much larger than we would expect if the
pseudocounts were just used to avoid overtraining of the conditional
probabilities derived from low counts. This large number of pseudo—
counts actually performs an interpolation between the conditional
and non—conditional probability distributions.

This can be understood by noting that the dependency between
two consecutive states is already described to some extent by the
HMM transitions for the HMM states, but not for the background.
Consequently, the conditional probabilities are better suited to the
background than to the HMM states. Using 10 000 pseudocounts,
the secondary—structure—based probabilities are very close to the con—
ditional ones for the background (which has several million counts
in the training data), but intermediate between conditional and non—
conditional for the HMM states (which have a few hundred to a few
thousand counts).

Figure 3a shows the prediction results using the different types of
secondary—structure—based emissions: purely non—conditional, purely
conditional or conditional with 10 000 pseudocounts taken from the
non—conditional distribution. Adding pseudocounts from the non—
conditional distribution to the conditional probabilities significantly
improves the performance of bbcontacts.

Another major contribution to the performance of bbcontacts is
brought by correcting the local background of the coupling matrices

applied to coupling matrices, for different values of S

in order to remove false positives, by avoiding the presence of dark
regions concentrating strong couplings in the predicted coupling
matrices (see ‘Methods’). The results in Figure 3b show a notable
performance improvement when using local background correction,
for the three displayed values of S. We chose S = 10 as the default
parameter for bbcontacts, because it displays the best improvement
in precision without loss in recall. The results for S25 show a
slightly higher precision for high-confidence predictions, but the
final recall is also lower.

Other terms in the bbcontacts model have a smaller inﬂuence on
the final performance. The prior depending on sequence separation
has a small, but consistently positive effect on the performance of
bbcontacts (Supplementary Figure 88a). The inﬂuence of including
signal from the secondary diagonals of the patterns as well as signal
from the main diagonal is analyzed in Supplementary Figure S8b.
Inclusion of secondary diagonal signal notably increases the final re—
call reached by bbcontacts. However, taking signal only from the
main diagonal slightly increases the precision for high-scoring predic-
tions. This effect is dampened when PSM is turned on. Finally, the red
traces in Figure 4b show that PSM slightly increases the precision for
high-confidence residue—level predictions, because it removes false
positives belonging to long paths with large Viterbi scores. The
strand—level performance is almost unaffected by PSM (Fig. 4a).

Although all methodological choices for bbcontacts illustrated in
this section relate to PSIPRED—based ﬂ—ﬂ contact predictions, the
performance of bbcontacts when using the DSSP assignments as an
input is either improved or unchanged by these choices (see
Supplementary Figures S9 and 810).

tive residue pairs within a C6 distance of 6 A are ignored (i.e. excluded from

ﬂ—ﬂ contact prediction methods, at the strand level (Fig. 4a) and at
the residue level (Fig. 4b). Supplementary Tables S2 and S3 present
a summary of this comparison. Supplementary Figure 811 shows the
strand—level results when testing for correct orientation of predicted
ﬂ—strands as well as correct pairing.

As a complementary view, Figure 1b and Supplementary Figure
S12 show examples of contact maps predicted by bbcontacts using
predicted secondary structure. These illustrate the capacity of
bbcontacts to remove noise from CCMpred coupling matrices.

Figure 4a, b and Supplementary Figure 811 clearly show that for
DSSP—based predictions (blue traces, blue symbols), bbcontacts out—
performs all previous methods, even though it was not specifically
designed to perform well for DSSP—assigned secondary structure.
This is particularly striking at the residue level. The effect is not as
strong at the strand level because bbcontacts was not trained to de—
tect isolated ﬂ—bridges, as we cannot expect secondary structure pre—
diction methods to detect isolated ﬂ—residues. However, ﬂ—bridges
are included in the performance assessment and the strand—level re—
call particularly suffers from this as ﬂ—bridges represent 17.6% of
the ﬂ—strand pairs in the BetaSheet916 dataset.

As expected, PSIPRED—based predictions (red traces in Fig. 4
and Supplementary Figure 811) are less confident than DSSP—based
predictions, but they still exhibit remarkable precision and recall. In
particular, residue—level PSIPRED—based predictions display better
precision and recall than previous methods when they use the true
secondary structure. The gap between DSSP—based and PSIPRED-
based performances (i.e. between the blue and red lines in Fig. 4) is
explained by errors in the PSIPRED predictions, but also by the
major advantage of knowing the exact DSSP strands compared with
strand predictions (however accurate), since using true secondary
structure we can rule out entirely any ﬂ—ﬂ contact occurring outside
of the strand regions.

The precision—recall curves show that bbcontacts not only has
good overall performance, but also provides (through the Viterbi
score associated with each path) a measure of the confidence we can
place in each prediction. The results of bbcontacts are quite robust:
the precision drops very slowly with recall, up to around 5 0% recall
for DSSP—based and 40% recall for PSIPRED—based predictions.

To investigate how much of the performance improvement ob—
tained with bbcontacts is due to using better contact predictions as
input, we introduced additional reference points BCov"' and
CMM"' , corresponding to results obtained when couplings predicted
with CCMpred are used as an input to the ﬂ—contact prediction algo—
rithms from BCov and CMM. Better input couplings strongly im—
prove ﬂ—ﬂ contact predictions, but this does not explain the full
extent of the bbcontacts DSSP—based performance (see
Supplementary Results and Supplementary Figure 813).

In Supplementary Figures S14 and 815, we analyze the perform—
ance of bbcontacts for each of the 916 test cases depending on the
alignment size N and on the CCMpred precision for US predicted
contacts (where L is the length of the protein). For each test case,
the F1—score is calculated for all ﬂ—ﬂ contact predictions above a
Viterbi score threshold chosen to maximize the residue—level F1-
score on the training dataset (Supplementary Figure 816). As ex—
pected, the trend for bbcontacts performance is to increase with N
and with CCMpred precision. However, even for alignments con—
taining a few hundred sequences, a number of cases display similar
performance compared with cases with many homologs.

Note that the precision and recall reported in this work are ra-
ther conservative estimates of how useful the predicted contacts
might be for structural modelling. Indeed, in compliance with previ—
ously published approaches, the evaluation adopted in this paper
relies on the DSSP definition of ﬂ—ﬂ contacts, based on backbone
hydrogen bonds. Because of this rigid definition, close side—chain
contacts between pairs of residues which do not form backbone con—
tacts (such as pairs of bulge residues or pairs of residues immediately
adjacent to ﬂ—strands, but not assigned as ﬂ—residues by DSSP) can

be detected as false positives. A few such false positives are shown in
Figure 1b: several residue pairs predicted by bbcontacts (triangles)
but not assigned by DSSP (i.e. not in open circles) display distances
below 6  Comparison of the solid and dashed red traces in Figure
4c and Supplementary Figure 817 shows that if we exclude all resi—
due pairs within 6  Cﬂ distance from the false positives during
evaluation, there is a large increase in bbcontacts precision for
PSIPRED—based predictions, reaching ~80% precision at 40% recall
on the full BetaSheet916 dataset (Supplementary Figure 817).

Finally, bbcontacts was compared with general contact predic—
tion methods: CCMpred (Seemayer et al., 2014), PhyCMAP (Wang
and Xu, 2013) and PconsC2 (Skwark et al., 2014). The results are
shown in Figure 4c, using both the DSSP—based evaluation frame—
work (solid lines) and the 6  distance tolerance (dashed lines). The
latter is a middle ground for evaluation, since bbcontacts was
trained to detect only ﬂ—ﬂ contacts strictly assigned by DSSP (mostly
distributed around 5 A), while the general contact predictors are de—
signed to detect all contacts up to 8  Due to the computational
cost of PconsC2, this evaluation is performed on a subset of
BetaSheet916 containing 186 protein chains (Supplementary
Dataset 82). However, the evaluation of bbcontacts, CCMpred and
PhyCMAP on the full BetaSheet916 dataset reported in
Supplementary Figure 817 shows very similar trends. As expected,
PhyCMAP, which does not use direct coupling analysis, displays
low precision even at low recall. PconsC2 improves largely over
PhyCMAP and CCMpred, but its precision drops much earlier with
recall than the bbcontacts precision, even when relaxing the evalu—
ation criteria to 6  tolerance.

Supplementary Figures 817—819 show the results when using 8 
tolerance in the evaluation: in this case, we also remove many false
positives corresponding to predicted ﬂ—ﬂ contacts with a shifted
register. Even so, bbcontacts improves greatly over CCMpred and
PhyCMAP, and the PconsC2 precision—recall curve drops earlier
than the bbcontacts curve.

4 Conclusion

bbcontacts is the first predictor of ﬂ—ﬂ contacts that does not require
known secondary structure from DSSP and that therefore can be
used in practice. Having to use predicted instead of true secondary
structure makes ﬂ—ﬂ contact prediction a much more challenging
problem. In particular, we can no longer rely on the knowledge of
the exact ﬂ—strand positions.

Analyzing the contributions of different terms in bbcontacts
shows that the choices that have a strong impact on PSIPRED—based
predictions do not affect DSSP—based results to the same extent
(compare for instance Fig. 3 with Supplementary Figure 89). This
underlines the importance of specifically designing methods to deal
with predicted secondary structure.

bbcontacts also illustrates that HMMs are an attractive ap—
proach for statistical modelling of variable—length ﬂ—ﬂ contacts
based on the detection of specific patterns in the coupling matrices.
The use of a local Viterbi algorithm enables the detection of local
patterns.

In addition, bbcontacts can pick up signal in a number of align-
ments with relatively few homologous sequences. Another interest—
ing feature is that it provides a score for each predicted ﬂ—strand
contact, which expresses the reliability of the prediction. Finally,
bbcontacts is provided as free and open—source software with few
dependencies. The runtimes on a single core of an Intel Xeon E5-
2650 processor are typically under one minute for proteins up to
500 residues, and up to a few minutes when PSM gets triggered

(Supplementary Figure 820). This makes bbcontacts easily applica—
ble to a variety of situations, including predictions for large proteins
and large—scale ﬂ—contact prediction. Another possible application
for bbcontacts would be the case of inter—chain ﬂ—sheets, provided
enough homologs are available for both chains.

bbcontacts could be further improved by including additional in-
formation in the HMM emissions, such as amino acid profiles and
solvent accessibility predictions, or other input sources complement—
ing CCMpred, for instance PSICOV (Jones et al., 2012). Further
planned work involves incorporating input from predictors such as
CMAPpro (Di Lena et al., 2012) or PhyCMAP (Wang and Xu,
2013) which do not use direct coupling analysis and perform better
than CCMpred or PconsC2 when few homologous sequences are
available (Skwark et al., 2014). One advantage of our approach in
this respect is that it can handle new sources of input in a probabilis—
tic manner, through the addition of new terms in the emission prob—
abilities. Also, one could improve the use of topological constraints
by calculating posterior probabilities for all ﬂ—strand topologies that
can be built from the list of best Viterbi paths. Finally, the approach
developed in this study can be generalized to detect patterns of other
interacting secondary structure elements such as helix—helix and
helix—strand interactions and thus points to a promising avenue for
future research.

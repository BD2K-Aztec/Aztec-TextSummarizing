ABSTRACT

Motivation: Structural variation including deletions, duplications and
rearrangements of DNA sequence are an important contributor to
genome variation in many organisms. In human, many structural
variants are found in complex and highly repetitive regions of
the genome making their identification difficult. A new sequencing
technology called strobe sequencing generates strobe reads
containing multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment
of DNA. Strobe reads thus generalize the concept of paired
reads, or mate pairs, that have been routinely used for structural
variant detection. Strobe sequencing holds promise for unraveling
complex variants that have been difficult to characterize with current
sequencing technologies.

Results: We introduce an algorithm for identification of structural
variants using strobe sequencing data. We consider strobe reads
from a test genome that have multiple possible alignments to
a reference genome due to sequencing errors and/or repetitive
sequences in the reference. We formulate the combinatorial
optimization problem of finding the minimum number of structural
variants in the test genome that are consistent with these alignments.
We solve this problem using an integer linear program. Using
simulated strobe sequencing data, we show that our algorithm has
better sensitivity and specificity than paired read approaches for
structural variation identification.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying the DNA sequence differences that distinguish
individuals is a major challenge in genetics. Recent whole—
genome sequencing and microarray measurements have shown that
copy number variants (insertions, duplications and deletions) and
balanced rearrangements, such as inversions and translocations, are
common in most organisms including human (Sharp et al., 2006),
mouse (Egan et al., 2007), ﬂy (Dopman and Hart], 2007) and yeast
(Faddah et al., 2009). These larger differences in DNA sequences
are commonly referred to as structural variants. The Database of
Genomic Variants (Iafrate et al., 2004) currently (winter 2010)
lists nearly 30000 copy number variants and nearly 900 inversion
variants in the human genome. Although some of these variants are

redundant and/or erroneous, it is clear that structural variation is
an important component of human genome variation. In fact, there
are more total base pairs in human genome affected by structural
variants than single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP; Redon et al.,
2006). Both common and inherited structural variants and de novo
structural variants have recently been linked to a number of human
diseases (Girirajan et al., 2010; Greenway et al., 2009; Marshall
et al., 2008). Moreover, somatic structural variants are common in
cancer genomes and lead to altered regulation of oncogenes and
tumor suppressor genes (Albertson et al., 2003) and the creation of
novel fusion genes (Mitelman et al., 2004).

Much of the recent excitement surrounding structural variation
stems from better measurement technologies. In particular, End
Sequence proﬁling (Raphael et al., 2003; Volik et al., 2003), also
known as paired read mapping (Korbel et al., 2007; Tuzun et al.,
2005), has been used to identify structural variants in both normal
and cancer genomes. In paired read mapping, DNA fragments from
a test genome are sequenced from both ends, and these sequences
(reads) are mapped to a reference genome. Paired reads, or mate
pairs, with discordant alignments identify inversions, translocations,
transpositions, insertions, deletions and other rearrangements that
distinguish the test genome from the reference genome. A number
of methods have been introduced to identify structural variants from
paired read sequencing data (Bashir et al., 2008; Chen et al., 2009;
Hormozdiari et al., 2009; Korbel et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2008;
Quinlan et al., 2010; Raphael et al., 2003).

Structural variants vary widely in size and complexity, and are
more difﬁcult to characterize than SNPs. Many are associated
with repeated sequences in the genome (Korbel et al., 2007),
complicating their detection and characterization. In extreme
cases, the variants themselves have highly repetitive or complex
organization relative to the reference genome. For example, different
lists of variants have been identiﬁed in the same individual using
older clone—based sequencing (Kidd et al., 2008) and various next—
generation sequencing platforms (Bentley et al., 2008; Hormozdiari
et al., 2009; Korbel et al., 2007). Characterizing these complex
variants requires longer reads, longer fragments, or both.

Paciﬁc Biosciences recently demonstrated strobe sequencing
technology (Turner, 2009). A strobe read, or strobe, consists of
multiple subreads from a single contiguous fragment of DNA. These
subreads are separated by a number of ‘dark’ nucleotides (called
advances), whose identity is unknown (Fig. l). A strobe with two
subreads is analogous to a paired read, while strobes with more than
two subreads provide additional information for structural variant
detection. Thus far, Paciﬁc Biosciences has demonstrated strobe
reads with lengths up to 10 kb with 2—4 subreads each of 50—200 bp.
Additional improvements are expected as technology matures.

concordant discordant

Fig. 1. A strobe read is a sequence of subreads and advances. When aligned
to a reference genome, pairs of adjacent subreads can either be labeled as
concordant or discordant, according to a derived minimum and maximum
allowed length of an advance.

Strobe sequencing provides reads from long, contiguous fragments
of DNA with low input DNA requirements, a feature missing
from current short insert sequencing technologies. However, a
consideration with strobe reads are the per—base error rates. While
the capabilities of the Paciﬁc Biosciences commercial machine
(expected later in 2010) are not yet known, we conservatively
assume that this error rate will be higher than existing next—
generation sequencing technologies. Thus, realizing the advantages
of strobe reads for structural variation detection demands new
algorithms that utilize information from multiple subreads while
allowing higher single—base error rates.

We introduce an algorithm to identify and characterize complex
structural variants with strobe reads by considering multiple possible
alignments for each subread. We formulate the combinatorial
optimization problem of selecting an alignment for each subread
of every strobe read so that the total number of structural variants
in the test genome is minimized. This generalizes a formulation that
has proved successful for paired read analysis (Hormozdiari et al.,
2009). We show how to reduce the problem to an optimization
problem on directed graphs, and derive an integer linear program
(ILP) for the problem. We apply our method to simulated strobe read
sequencing data. We ﬁnd that strobe reads outperform paired reads
for structural variation detection. In particular, at a ﬁxed sensitivity
level strobe reads have nearly double the speciﬁcity of paired reads.

2 APPROACH

A strobe read, or n-strobe, S=(R1,A1,R2,A2,...,An_1,Rn) is an
alternating sequence of subreads Ri, whose sequence is known, and
advances Aj, unknown sequences of ‘dark’ bases. The sequencing
technology does not identify precisely the length, or number of dark
bases, in each advance. However, the length of an advance is related
to the time that the DNA polymerase incorporates dark bases. Thus,
a distribution f (a) for the length is obtained from the data. From this
distribution, we derive a minimum and maximum allowed length of
an advance which we denote by Lmin and Lmax, respectively.
Suppose one has strobe reads from a test genome and wants
to identify structural variants that distinguish this genome from a
reference genome. The ﬁrst step in structural variation identiﬁcation
is to align the strobe reads to the reference genome. Each subread
Ri is aligned independently and corresponds to an interval [vim]
on the reference genome. Suppose that ([v1,x1],...,Lvn,xn]) is a
sequence of alignments for the subreads of an n—strobe S. We say

that an adjacent pair of subread alignments (Lvi,xi],[vi+1,xi+1])
is concordant provided alignments are on the same strand and
in the same order on the reference1 and Lmin 5 |yi+1 —xi| fLmax.
Otherwise, we say that the pair of subread alignments is discordant.
Similarly, we say that a strobe read alignment is concordant if all
pairs of adjacent subread alignments are concordant; otherwise, the
strobe read is discordant.

A discordant pair ([vi,x,-], Lvi+1,xi+1]) suggests a structural
variant in the test genome. For example, the breakpoints of a deletion
from a pair of alignments mapped to the positive strand of the
reference genome satisfy the equation

Lmin5(a—xi)+(yi+l _b)ELmax (1)

See Figure 1. Similar equations hold for inversions, translocations
and other variants (Bashir et al., 2008).

A collection of discordant strobe reads indicate the same structural
variant, if they have discordant pairs that simultaneously satisfy the
equation above for a particular choice of breakpoints a and b.

Now consider the case when subreads of a strobe read do not have
unique alignments to the reference genome because of repetitive
sequences in the reference genome and/or sequencing errors. In
this case, the selection of an alignment for a subread determines a
candidate structural variant. Our intuition is that breakpoints of true
structural variants will be contained in many strobe reads. Thus, we
aim to choose an alignment for each subread of every strobe read
so that the resulting set of structural variants is optimal according
to some objective function. This problem has been considered in
the paired read case by Lee et al. (2008) and Hormozdiari et al.
(2009). In particular, Hormozdiari et al. (2009) deﬁne the maximum
parsimony objective function of choosing alignments to minimize
the number of predicted structural variants.

Below we consider the equivalent problem for strobe reads, show
a reduction to an optimization problem on directed graphs and derive
an ILP for the problem.

3 METHODS

3.1 Problem formulation

Consider an n—strobe S = (R1,A1,R2,A2, ...,A,,_1,R,,) consisting of subreads
R,- and advances Aj. For a subread Ri, let M (R,) denote the set of locations
in the reference genome where R,- aligns, with each element of M (R,) being
an interval [y,x] on the reference genome. An alignment for S is obtained
by selecting an alignment m,- eM(R,-) for each subread Ri. Thus, let M (S) =
M(Rl) ><M(R2) ><  ><M(R,,) be the set of alignments for S.

For meM (S), let B(m) be the set of genomic breakpoints indicated by
m. If m is concordant, then B(m)=®. Note that these breakpoints are only
approximately deﬁned according to the uncertainty in the advance lengths
[e. g. according to Equation ( 1)]. We deﬁne the following problem.

n—STROBE MINIMUM BREAKPOINTS PROBLEM. Given alignment sets
M(Sl),...,M(SK) for n-strobes 51,...,SK, ﬁnd a set of breakpoints B of
minimum cardinality such that for all k: 1,...,K there is an mk €M(Sk)
with B(mk) E B.

This problem is NP—hard, as was shown for the paired read case (n22)
by a reduction to the Set Cover problem (Hormozdiari et al., 2009). Below,
we reformulate this problem for general n as an ILP.

 

1The deﬁnition of concordant is different for paired read sequencing
technologies (e. g. Illumina) that produce reads on opposite DNA strands.

3.2 Graph construction

We derive our ILP from a directed graph G: (V,E) that represents
breakpoints shared by multiple strobe reads. We begin with a graph whose
edges are alignments of a subread and vertices are advances between
subreads. Formally, consider an individual strobe read S. We represent the
set of all possible alignments for S with a directed graph G5 = (VS,ES). The
vertex set Vs=u;.:11(M(R,)><M(R,+1))U{as,es} is the set of all possible
pairs of alignments of adjacent subreads, with an additional source vertex
as and sink vertex ﬁg corresponding to the start of the ﬁrst subread and
the end of the last subread, respectively. We refer to vertices that are not
sources or sinks as internal vertices. The edge set E5 = UiM(R,-), where each
m: [y,x] eM(R,-) corresponds to a directed edge (y,x). The alignments for
strobe read S are exactly the set of paths in G5 from as to ﬁg.

In the graph construction, we use concordant pairs to reduce the number
of alignments that we consider for subreads. In particular, if there exists
a concordant pair for subreads R,- and Ri+1, then we ignore all discordant
pairs for these subreads R,- with lower alignment score. For every concordant
pair of alignments m,- eM(R,-) and mi+1 eM(R,-+1), we consider the vertex
v=(m,-,m,-+1), add edges from all incoming neighbors to v to all outward
neighbors from v and ﬁnally remove v from the graph.

Now we form a graph G: (V,E) by merging vertices in the graphs GS
whose alignments are consistent with a single breakpoint (a,b) according
to (1). We compute the vertices to merge using GASV (Sindi et al., 2009),
a program that efﬁciently computes whether paired reads indicate the same
structural variant using a computational geometry algorithm. In each merged
vertex, we store the identities of strobe and subread alignments from the
original vertices.

The n—Strobe Minimum Breakpoints Problem reduces to ﬁnding a
subgraph H of minimum cardinality (fewest number of vertices) such that
H contains a path from source oak to sink bk for all k=1,...,K. Note that
H will always contain the source and sink vertices.

3.3 ILP formulation

The graph formulation suggests that ﬁnding the subgraph H might be solved
as a ﬁxed charge network ﬂow problem. In particular, the graph formulation is
suggestive of a ﬁxed charge multi—commodity network ﬂow problem (Crainic
et al., 2001), with each strobe representing a distinct commodity. However,
our problem differs from this and related problems in that we need to maintain
separate accounting of each strobe entering and exiting a vertex rather than
merely accounting for the net ﬂow as in a multi—commodity ﬂow problem.

Nevertheless, we are able to formulate our problem as an ILP, motivated
by an ILP for the ﬁxed charge ﬂow problem (Hochbaum and Segev, 1989).
For each vertex v,- e G, we deﬁne binary indicator variables p,- such that p,- = 1
if and only if v,- is in the optimal solution. Similarly, we introduce variables
as, which represent the ﬂow across edge (vi, Vj) for strobe k. Lastly, we deﬁne
Ni"+ and Ni]: as the outward and inward neighbors, respectively, of vertex v,-
and strobe k.

Fig. 2. Construction of graph for 3—strobes S1,...,S6. In Step 1, the
discordant pairs (dotted lines) are clustered, producing seven candidate
deletions. In Step 2, a graph is created with a source vertex oz and a sink
vertex b for each strobe and one vertex for each cluster (candidate deletion).
The number on each vertex indicates the number of strobes with a discordant
pair consistent with the deletion. In Step 3, the graph is simpliﬁed using
heuristics described in Section 3.4. Step 3 is repeated until the graph has
converged, upon which it is used as input to the ILP.

edge q;- must have weight 0 or l—it is either used once or not used at all
per strobe. However, this does not need to be enforced as an explicit binary
integer constraint. Instead, constraint (3) bounds a; between 0 and 1. Note
that the ﬂow for any edge ql‘j can only be non—zero if the v,- and Vj are in the
optimal solution. Constraint (4) ensures that each strobe has a valid sequence
of subread alignments.

3.4 Graph simpliﬁcation

In order to improve performance, we developed several heuristics to simplify
the graph G before solving the ILP (Fig. 2).

(l) Vertex removal: remove vertices in G that are supported by fewer
than A strobe reads. We deﬁne the support of a vertex as the number
of strobe reads with paths through it. We require that a breakpoint
be supported by at least A strobe reads. Thus, we remove internal
vertices with support less than A. Note that we must count the number
of strobe reads that travel through the vertex, rather than the number

of discordant pairs that cluster together, because the same strobe read
might have multiple discordant pairs that support the same breakpoint.
We also remove all incoming and outgoing edges of a removed vertex.

V

Strobe removal: remove a strobe read S in G with no path from source
org to sink ﬁg. Following vertex removal, some strobe reads will no
longer have a path from source to sink. We remove each of these
strobe reads from the graph. We use a dynamic program to efﬁciently
check the path constraint for each strobe.

(3

V

Edge removal: remove edges corresponding to subread alignments for
strobe read S that are on a path from source 05g to sink ﬁg. Following
vertex removal, each strobe S will have at least one path from source
to sink, but may have extraneous alignments that do not lie on any
path from source to sink. We remove such edges from the graph, since
they cannot appear in the ILP solution due to the ﬂow constraint. The
dynamic program for strobe removal is also used for this step.

We iteratively perform these three operations on G until no more vertices,
strobe reads or edges are removed.

3.5 Benchmarking

Here, we present the computations used to assess sensitivity and speciﬁcity
in detecting a set of known deletions. Consider a set of deletions deﬁned
by intervals P={[a1,b1],...,[a|p|,b|p|]} known to be present in the test
genome. Given a set B: {[cl,d1], ..., [C|B|,d|B|]} of intervals corresponding
to a prediction returned by the ILP, we compute two different Receiver
Operating Characteristic (ROC)—like plots.

(1) Variant-based ‘ROC’. We count the number of deletions [ai,b,-] GP
that have a non—empty intersection with some interval [Cj, dj] EB and

(dj —Cj) S (bi —Clt‘) +LmaXa

i.e. the prediction length must be smaller than the deletion length plus
the largest allowed length of an advance. Let the number of such
variants be V. The true positive rate is %. and the number of false
positives |B| — V. Note that this is not a true ROC curve because we
do not compute a false positive rate, but rather report the number of

false positives (hence the quotes).

V

Pair-based ROC. We count the number of discordant pairs that support
variants. Let D(P) be the set of discordant pairs that support variants in
P, and let D(P) be the remaining discordant pairs. Similarly, let D(B)
be the discordant pairs that support variants in B. The true positive

4 RESULTS

We applied our algorithm to simulated strobe sequencing data from
Paciﬁc Biosciences. The Paciﬁc Biosciences simulator models the
errors in their single—molecule sequencing technology. Speciﬁcally,
the simulator models the higher rate of insertions and deletions
(using a roughly equivalent ratio of each) relative to miscall errors
in subreads that is typically seen in their data (Eid et al., 2009).
We analyze two datasets: structural variants identiﬁed in the Venter
whole— genome assembly (Levy et al., 2007) and a synthetic complex
rearrangement in highly repetitive regions. For each dataset, we
generated 3—strobe reads of length 3 kb, consisting of three subreads
of 200 bp separated by 1200 bp advances. We then introduced
error into the subreads in each strobe using Paciﬁc Biosciences’s
error simulator. Since the capabilities of the Paciﬁc Biosciences
commercial machine (expected later in 2010) are not yet known,
we conservatively assume a sequencing error rate of 5%.

4.1 Comparison to paired reads

For each dataset, we compare the results with strobe reads to
those obtained via paired reads. To remove differences due to read
alignment, we construct paired reads using subsets of the subreads
in each strobe. We consider two sets of paired reads:

(1) Paired Read Library (1.6kb fragment length): for each
n—strobe S=(R1,A1,R2,A2,...,Rn_1,An_1,Rn), we deﬁne
the set of pairs £(S): {(Ri,R,-+1)}.

(2) Mixed Paired Read Library (1.6 and 3 kb fragment lengths):
we deﬁne the set of pairs A(S)= {(Ri,RJ-) :j > i}.

The Paired Read Library dataset corresponds to a paired read
dataset generated by a single size selection, while the Mixed Paired
Read Library dataset corresponds to multiple fragment sizes. Note
that for Illumina and ABI SOLiD machines, the latter requires
preparation of multiple sequencing libraries.

Given a set of strobe reads with physical coverage c, the Paired
Read Library will have approximately the same physical coverage
as strobe reads with twice as many reads. The Mixed Paired Read
Library will have physical coverage 2c with three times as many
reads. We subsample the reads in the Mixed Paired Read Library to
achieve physical coverage c.

4.2 Variant detection on Venter Chromosome 17

We simulated a test chromosome based on known rearrangements
from Chromosome 17 of the Venter genome (Levy et al., 2007),
following the procedure presented in Chen et al. (2009). Given a
list of 17 376 insertions, deletions and inversions on Chromosome
17, we concatenated intervals from the hg18 human reference
corresponding to the rearrangements. We then simulated 3 kb strobe
reads at 10X, 20X and 30X coverage, producing 262 355, 524 709
and 787 064 strobe reads, respectively. After aligning the subreads
to Chromosome 17 of hg18 using Paciﬁc Biosciences’s in—house
aligner, BLASR, we generated a Paired Read library and a Mixed
Paired Read library as described in Section4.1. BLASR is designed
to quickly align large reads and is tolerant to a wide range of
sequencing errors (M.Chaisson, personal communication).

4.2.1 Deletions We considered the 124 deletions greater than
120 bp in Venter and computed the variant—based ROC curve by
varying A, the minimum support of a vertex (Fig. 3). In terms
of ‘Area under the ROC Curve’ (AROC) values, strobe reads
outperform paired reads for all three coverages. Moreover, strobe
reads outperform Mixed Paired Reads for 10x and 30X coverages,
where the advantage in AROC for the Mixed Paired Read library is a
result of slightly better speciﬁcity at extremely low (< 20%) values
of sensitivity. On average, at ﬁxed values of sensitivity, strobe reads
make 57.18% :l:4.282 fewer false positive predictions than paired
reads. At 20X coverage and a maximum sensitivity of 87.10% for
strobe reads, 90.32% for the Paired Read library and 92.74% for the
Mixed Paired Read library, strobe reads make 45.13% fewer false
positive predictions than the Paired Read library, and 61.53% fewer
false positive predictions than the Mixed Paired Read library.

It is possible that some of the predictions in the ILP solutions
are accurate, but we fail to identify them as a true positives
because the breakpoint coordinates might be shifted due to nearby
structural variants. Of the considered deletions, 39 have another
event (at least 50 bp in size) within the corresponding advance.

Fig. 3. ROC curves for the Venter simulation. The top row is a variant—based ‘ROC’ curve for 124 deletions 2120 bp, which computes the number of real
deletions out of 124 that appear in the solution. The bottom row is a pair—based ROC curve for the same 124 deletions, which counts the number of discordant
pairs that support the real deletions (see Section 3.5). The reported ‘AROC’ is the area under the curves normalized by the maximum x—value in each plot.
For 10x coverage, A ranges from 2 to 10 in steps of 2. For 20x and 30x coverage A ranges from 4 to 20 in steps of 2.

Thus, we considered the pairs that span the 124 deletions in each
dataset and computed the ‘pair—based’ ROC curve (Fig. 3). Strobe
reads outperform paired reads and mixed paired reads for all three
coverages (AROC). Strobe reads decrease the false positive rate
by an average of 50.83%:l:4.83 compared with the Paired Read
datasets and 56.07% :l: 8.11 compared with the Mixed Paired Read
libraries at ﬁxed sensitivity.

The size and topology of the graph G used as input to the ILP
varies between the Strobe, Paired Read and Mixed Paired Read
libraries, affecting the runtime of the ILP. In particular, the Strobe
datasets construct graphs with fewer edges and vertices than the
Paired Read and Mixed Paired Read libraries. For example, with
support A=8 there are ~65% fewer edges and internal vertices
for 10X coverage; ~80% fewer edges and internal vertices for
20X coverage; and ~83% fewer edges and internal vertices for
30X coverage (Table 1). Note that this does not necessarily indicate
that the Strobe dataset generates fewer clusters that are used to
construct the graph; Strobe and Paired Read datasets predict the
same number of clusters at each coverage (which is expected
due to the Paired Read library construction in Section 4.1); and
the Mixed Paired Read library uses a smaller set of clusters to
construct the graph G. In addition to the size of the input graph
G, the graph topology is different between the Strobe datasets and
the Paired Read libraries. In general, graphs with many connected
components are easily parallelizable, as each connected component
could be run independently of the others. While all graphs contain
many connected components, the graphs of Paired Read and Mixed
Paired Read libraries contain connected components with many

more internal vertices than graphs with Strobe data. For example,
at 10X coverage with A :4, the largest connected component for
the Paired Read library contained 350 internal vertices while the
largest connected component for the Strobe dataset contained only
six internal vertices. One such connected component from the Strobe
dataset with 10x coverage is shown in Figure 4.

4.2.2 Inversions Only four inversions appear on Venter
Chromosome 17 with lengths detectable by the simulated
sequencing data. Our method detects the two longest inversions
of these four for the Strobe and Paired Read libraries, while the
Strobe dataset predicts 22% fewer false positives (Table 2). Here,
the true positive rate computation described in Section 3.5 does not
apply; instead we counted an inversion if the mutual intersection
between the inversion interval and the prediction interval was
>50%, following Chen et al. (2009).

4.2.3 Comparison with short read sequencing To illustrate
the advantages of the longer fragments and subreads of strobe
sequencing, we compared strobe reads to simulated paired read
data that approximates the fragments sizes and read lengths that
are routinely obtained with short read, short insert sequencing
technologies (Fig. 5). Using the same Venter Chromosome 17,
we simulated 200 bp fragments with 50 bp reads using the wgsim
program from SAMtools (Li et al., 2009) at 20X coverage. The
simulated fragments have a base error rate of 0.02, a mutation rate
of 0.001, 10% indels and 30% probability that an indel is extended.
We aligned the reads using Burrows—Wheeleer Alignment (BWA)

The clustering statistics include the number of discordant pairs after removing concordant alignments, the number of these discordant pairs
that are deletions (their lengths are greater than Lmax and they have proper orientation) and the number of clusters. The graph statistics
include the number of strobe reads or paired ends that are removed from the graph, the number that are retained, the number of internal
vertices and the number of edges in the graph. The solution statistics report the number of internal vertices in the ﬁnal ILP solution and the

number of these vertices that are in the list of 124 deletions Z 120 bp.

(Li and Durbin, 2009). We then ran GASV (Sindi et al., 2009) on
the discordant pairs that map uniquely to the reference.

Since VariationHunter (Hormozdiari et al., 2009) utilizes reads
with non—unique alignments, we considered discordant pairs that
have multiple alignments to the reference. We considered reads
with low mapping quality (510) for BWA and aligned them with
Novoalign, an aligner that has higher sensitivity than BWA at the
cost of a longer running time (Krawitz et al., 2010). We considered
up to 100 alignments for reads aligned with Novoalign. At maximum
speciﬁcity for strobe reads, where the true positive rate is 0.87,
VariationHunter achieves a true positive rate of 0.35 and GASV
achieves a true positive rate of 0.34 at approximately the same
sensitivity (between 85 and 95 false positives).

We emphasize that this comparison is limited by its use of
simulated data, and by our use of VariationHunter and GASV
without further post—processing. For example, the VariationHunter
publication (Hormozdiari et al., 2009) describes several additional
steps used to achieve better performance. Additionally, uncontrolled
simulation parameters such as the fragment length and the
subread length affect the comparison, and explicitly comparing the
performance of different types of sequencing platforms is beyond
the scope of this article.

4.3 Variant detection in repetitive regions

Repetitive regions in the genome are notoriously difﬁcult for
structural variant detection. To test the ability of strobe reads to
capture breakpoints near repetitive regions, we constructed a 11.6 kb
sequence with two translocations by concatenating three different
transposons from hg18: a 6kb L1—family LINE (chr2:181406133—
181413161), a 503 bp Alu (chr7:66854543—66856104) and a 3kb
L2—family LINE (chr15:87930634—87933678), each ﬂanked by
500 bp. From this sequence, we generated 10 simulations with
10x coverage using the same sized 3kb strobe reads as above
and introduced 5% error. After aligning the subreads to hg18,

hundreds of different regions on the genome, causing the Paired
Read libraries to contain many internal vertices in the input graph
for the ILP. However, the number of vertices in the graph is
greatly reduced using strobe reads, indicating that many pairs in
these repetitive regions are eliminated by incorporating concordant
information (Fig. 6).

5 DISCUSSION

Structural variants vary widely in size and complexity, and thus
are generally more difﬁcult to characterize than SNPs. Sensitive
and speciﬁc detection of structural variation in human genomes
from next—generation sequencing data remains a challenge. This
is due to both technological limitations (in read length, error
rates and insert sizes) and biological factors. Structural variants
in human are: (i) enriched for repetitive sequences near their
breakpoints (Kidd et al., 2008); (ii) may overlap or have complex
architectures; and (iii) recurrent (but not identical) variants may
exist at the same locus (Perry et al., 2008; Scherer et al.,
2007). We have shown that strobe reads have advantages in
sensitivity and speciﬁcity over paired reads for structural variant

detection. Since a single strobe can resolve multiple breakpoints,
inference of duplications and rearrangements become more direct.
The method handles both intra—chromosomal (Section 4.2) and inter—
chromosomal (Section 4.3) events, making it suitable for genome—
wide analyses. While we have examined deletions, inversions and
translocations in simulated strobe read data, explicitly testing the
detection power of insertions using strobe reads remains future work.
An interesting question is whether strobe reads will detect more
complex variants that are beyond the abilities of current sequencing
technologies.

We showed a preliminary comparison of simulated strobe
sequencing versus simulated short read, short insert sequencing.
Although this comparison demonstrates an advantage for strobes,
a more rigorous assessment with real sequencing data is required to
obtain a deﬁnite comparison of these technologies.

An inherent limitation in any approach is the accuracy of
the underlying alignments. Most second generation sequencing
technologies produce short reads with increasing error rates near
the end of the reads and few insertions. The Paciﬁc Biosciences
technology differs in that it has predominantly long reads, uniform
error over the entire read and an insertion/deletion heavy error model
(Eid et al., 2009). For these reasons, different alignment approaches
have been suggested that use k—mer seeding followed by alignment
extension (Li and Durbin, 2010). In our study, mappings were ranked
using a naive Smith—Waterman score, assuming uniform quality of
all sequenced bases. As mapping and scoring for single—molecule
sequencing technologies mature, the proposed ILP can be changed to
use more sophisticated scoring functions, increasing sensitivity (by
ensuring true alignments are included) and speciﬁcity (by reducing
spurious alignments).

Current and new technologies are continually increasing the read
length (or subread length in the case of strobe reads). Longer
subreads imply a higher frequency of split reads (subreads which
span a breakpoint). Such events can be readily incorporated into
the ILP by converting subreads with non—overlapping mappings
(relative to the subread) into psuedo—strobe reads, leading to paths
of variable length from source to sink for a given strobe read. The
advance in this case becomes the distance between the end of the
ﬁrst alignment and the start of second alignment on the subread. This
allows the method to be used as a generic framework for evaluating
genome—wide structural variation given any form of sequencing
data.

The suggested model is designed to handle germ—line mutations.
In scenarios with heterogeneous data or when somatic mutations are
abundant, such as in cancer, the assumptions in our model could
be limiting. For example, the notion of minimizing breakpoints
and clustering breakpoint junctions may be incorrect. In areas
of elevated chromosome instability, each individual cancer cell
may undergo different mutations leading to slightly (or greatly)
different breakpoint boundaries. Additionally, breakpoint clustering
is signiﬁcantly more challenging as some genomic aberrations may
only be present in a small fraction of cells. Integrating copy number
information on a per breakpoint basis could provide added power in
detecting these lower frequency events.

6 CONCLUSIONS

We introduce a combinatorial algorithm for structural variant
identiﬁcation from strobe read sequencing data. We show that strobe

reads outperform paired reads on simulated sequencing data. In
particular, strobe reads have nearly doubled the speciﬁcity at ﬁxed
sensitivity for structural variation prediction. In the near future, we
will test our algorithm on real sequencing data.

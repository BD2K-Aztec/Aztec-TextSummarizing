ABSTRACT

Summary: ExpEdit is a web application for assessing RNA editing
in human at known or user-specified sites supported by transcript
data obtained by RNA-Seq experiments. Mapping data (in SAM/BAM
format) or directly sequence reads [in FASTQ/short read archive
(SRA) format] can be provided as input to carry out a comparative
analysis against a large collection of known editing sites collected in
DARNED database as well as other user-provided potentially edited
positions. Results are shown as dynamic tables containing University
of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) links for a quick examination of the
genomic context.

Availability: ExpEdit is freely available on the web at
http://www.caspur.it/ExpEdit/.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

RNA editing is a post-transcriptional mechanism challenging
the central dogma of molecular biology. According to such
phenomenon, genetic information is enzymatically overwritten
at speciﬁc sites to generate transcripts different from their
corresponding genomic templates [for a comprehensive review see
Gott and Emeson (2000)]. Historically, RNA editing has been
described for the ﬁrst time as the insertion and the deletion of uridine
residues in mitochondrial RNAs of kinetoplastid protozoa (Benne
et al., 1986). Nowadays, the term RNA editing is also used to indicate
post-transcriptional changes due to speciﬁc base substitutions (Gott
and Emeson, 2000). Such alterations may affect coding as well as
non-coding RNAs located in different cellular compartments and
occur in a variety of organisms including prokaryotes, animals,
plants and Viruses, through unrelated biochemical mechanisms (Gott
and Emeson, 2000).

In mammals and, in particular in human nuclei, the A-to-I
conversion is the most frequent type of RNA editing catalyzed
by the ADAR (adenosine deaminase acting on RNA) family of

enzymes that requires double stranded RNA as a substrate to carry
out the deamination (Keegan et al., 2001). Inosines are commonly
interpreted as guanosines by splicing and translational machineries
as well as sequencing enzymes. Several A—to-I changes have been
described in coding regions causing amino acid substitutions with
functional consequences. The vast majority of editing sites, however,
have been recently found in repeated regions of the human genome
and especially in Alu rich segments (Barak et al., 2009).

Although the functional and physiological role of many human
edits is currently elusive, the molecular mechanism of RNA editing
is indispensable to preserve the cellular homeostasis. Deregulation
of RNA editing has been associated to a variety of pathological
phenotypes including several neurodegenerative diseases (Maas
et al., 2006). Moreover, mice lacking the ADAR activity die during
or soon after the weaning (Keegan et al., 2001).

A-to-I conversions in human have been mainly discovered
computationally by analyzing alignments of messenger RNA
(mRNA)/expressed sequence tag (EST) sequences against their
source genome (Levanon et al., 2004). Padlock experiments in
combination with deep sequencing have also been used to conﬁrm
computationally selected editing candidates in different human
tissues (Li,J.B. et al., 2009). Nowadays, >40 000 editing changes are
known in human and they are freely available through the specialized
DARNED database (Kiran and Baranov, 2010).

The extraordinary coverage provided by RNA-Seq methodology
can now provide a comprehensive transcriptome snapshot
dramatically improving our understanding of gene expression
dynamics in different tissues, developmental stages or pathological
conditions (Wang et al., 2009). Massive transcriptome sequencing
offers the great opportunity to explore and investigate post-
transcriptional changes due to RNA editing (Picardi et al., 2010).
Indeed, the huge amount of short reads generated by the RNA-Seq
provides signiﬁcant support for individual genomic positions after
the appropriate mapping strategy and facilitates the identiﬁcation of
A-to-G conversions. RNA-Seq experiments, therefore, may allow
large-scale detection of editing sites thus contributing to elucidate
their functional roles in a variety of tissues, developmental stages
and physiological conditions. A large amount of RNA-Seq data
is now publicly available through the SRA repository at National
Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI). However, no tool
has been developed so far to investigate such data, as well as newly
produced RNA-Seq data. To ﬁll this gap we developed an ad hoc web

designed for exploring the editing pattern in human.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

The core of ExpEdit has been developed in python programming
language by using the SAMtools package (Li,H. et al., 2009) and
hypertext preprocessor (PHP) scripting to dynamically generate web
pages. To run the application, the user needs to upload one or more
short read datasets in the standard FASTQ or SRA format (gzip or
bz2 compression for FASTQ is also admitted to speed up the upload
process). Short reads are then quickly mapped onto the complete
human genome by Bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009), tolerating by
default at most three mismatches in the simpler end-to-end alignment
mode and requiring uniquely mapping reads. Nonetheless, Bowtie
parameters can be freely adjusted before the submission. As an
alternative, pre-aligned reads by other software can be uploaded
in SAM or BAM format. ExpEdit can handle paired-end reads and
performs spliced alignments by means of Tophat program based on
Bowtie (Trapnell et al., 2009).

In the next step, unique read alignments in SAM/BAM format are
converted in the pileup format using SAMtools in order to explore
all mappings position by position. Finally, the resulting pileup ﬁle
is parsed to extract known RNA editing positions annotated in the
specialized DARNED database (Kiran and Baranov, 2010). For each
position, the nucleotide distribution of supporting reads is calculated
as well as the percentage of editing. A speciﬁc ﬁlter that excludes
bases with a phred—like quality score lower than a preﬁxed cut-off
(by default equal to 20) has been also introduced. In addition, read
nucleotides supporting a speciﬁc genomic position can be ﬁltered
according to the strand of the reference to take into account the effect
of antisense transcription (recommended for strand-oriented reads).

The most relevant step of the ExpEdit workﬁow is the
accurate read-to-genome mapping, because erroneous alignments
can seriously affect editing detection and quantiﬁcation. Alignment
biases can be mitigated using reads mapping in unique genome
locations and increasing the number of mismatches. To improve the
mapping reliability in proximity of repeated regions, reads longer
than 50 bases or paired-ends should be used. In any case, users are
completely free to reﬁne ofﬂine their alignments and then upload
the relevant SAM or BAM ﬁles.

At the end of the analysis, ExpEdit returns a summary table
with relevant information for each editing site including genomic
location, base coverage, editing extent, gene name and region
(CDS, intron or UTR) as well as an external link to the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome browser
showing the relevant genomic context. Potential single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are also indicated in order to be ﬁltered out
if required.

Output tables can be dynamically sorted, ﬁltered and exported as
textual/excel ﬁles for ofﬂine downstream analyses. ExpEdit can also
explore RNA editing candidates not yet annotated in the DARNED
database uploading as input a text ﬁle with a list of putative editing
positions. The analysis of multiple FASTQ (from different lanes of
the same run) or SRA or SAM or BAM ﬁles or a combination of
them is also permitted in a single job.

Although there are no real technical limitations (except for the
2 GB threshold for direct upload of input ﬁles), potential errors

related to the methodology (the cross mapping is the most relevant)
should be taken into account. Moreover, ExpEdit is not a prediction
tool and, thus, new editing candidates detected providing user-
submitted candidate positions should be experimentally conﬁrmed
to exclude mapping errors or nucleotide changes due to unknown
SNPs.

The current release of ExpEdit has been extensively tested
on Illumina FASTQ ﬁles from the SRA archive at the NCBI.
SOLiD short reads cannot presently analyzed as such but standard
SAM/BAM ﬁles generated after the appropriate color space mapping
can be uploaded as well. Similarly, SAM/BAM ﬁles containing
alignments of longer reads from 454 or Sanger sequencing can be
also provided.

To facilitate and speed-up the upload process, ExpEdit can
automatically retrieve input ﬁles from valid ftp or http links by using
the wget application. In this way there are no limitations on the
size of input ﬁles. Examples of the ExpEdit application as well as
details about input and output ﬁles are described in Supplementary
Materials.

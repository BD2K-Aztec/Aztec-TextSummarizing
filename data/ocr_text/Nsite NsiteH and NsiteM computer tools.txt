Abstract

Summary: Gene transcription is mostly conducted through interactions of various transcription
factors and their binding sites on DNA (regulatory elements, REs). Today, we are still far from
understanding the real regulatory content of promoter regions. Computer methods for identifica-
tion of REs remain a widely used tool for studying and understanding transcriptional regulation
mechanisms. The Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM programs perform searches for statistically significant
(non-random) motifs of known human, animal and plant one-box and composite REs in a single
genomic sequence, in a pair of aligned homologous sequences and in a set of functionally related
sequences, respectively.

1 Introduction

Transcription regulatory elements (RES) bound by transcription fac-
tors (TFs) are main players in gene expression (Griinberg and Hahn,
2013). Although a large set of experimentally identified REs/TFs has
been collected in several databases (Ramirez and Basu, 2009;
Solovyev et al., 2010), the real RE content of promoters of most
genes remains unidentified.

Established computational RE identification algorithms are predom-
inantly based on one of two approaches: (i) the search for motifs of
known REs or (ii) the comparative analysis of homologous sequences
aimed to discover new REs (Ladunga, 2010; Solovyev et al., 2010). The
first type of methods uses regulatory site and/or IUPAC consensus se-
quences or position-weight matrices. One of challenges in RE detection
is to estimate the statistical significance of located motifs to distinguish
them from random matches. In addition, in some cases, TFs bind a
composite RE (a pair of DNA motifs with a spacer sequence of variable
length between them) rather than a single short DNA region.

Here, we present Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM, a set of programs to
predict both single and composite REs in query sequences and esti-
mate their statistical significance.

2 Results

Previously, we proposed a probabilistic model that computes the prob-
ability of observing given sequence motifs or consensuses in random nu-
cleotide sequences of the same length and nucleotide frequencies as a
query sequence. The model also estimates the expected number of such
motifs in random sequences. In particular, the model assumes that be-
cause REs are small that numbers rather than frequencies of nucleotides
should be used to describe RE consensus sequences (Shakhmuradov
et al., 1986; Solovyev et al., 2010; see also Supplementary Material 54).
These statistical estimations provide the opportunity to find non-ran-
dom similarities (unlikely to have occurred by chance) between a set of
functional motifs and regions of an analyzed sequence. By applying this
approach, we developed the Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM computer

Tools for studying transcription RES

programs that use various functional motif datasets. Using data from
the largest three transcription RE databases: TRANSFAC (Wingender
et al., 2001), oTFD (Ghosh, 2000) and RegSite DB (http://linux1.soft—
berry.com/berry. phtml?topic=regsite), we composed two animal
(ooTFD and TRANSFAC) RE datasets and one plant (RegSite) RE
dataset containing 8030, 3486 and 2871 single or composite REs, re-
spectively. Other frequently cited and available sources of plant tran-
scription REs, PLACE (http://www.dna.affrc.go.jp/PLACE/info.html)
and PlantCARE (http://bioinformatics.psb.ugent.be/webtools/plantcare/
html/) include much less known REs or their consensuses (469 and 435
records, respectively). A user has a choice of selecting one of three data-
sets or providing own RE set as well as adjusting the search parameters.
The format of RE datasets is presented in Supplementary Figure S1
(Supplementary Material S1).

Nsite performs searches for statistically non-random motifs of
known REs in a single DNA sequence. A predicted motif is con-
sidered as statistically significant whether (i) the expected (by
chance) number of such motifs is less than a given threshold and (ii)
the total number of identified motifs is 295% confidence interval
upper limit. The search and statistical estimations are performed
separately on both strands of a query sequence.

NsiteH discovers RE motifs with a given conservation level in a
pair of aligned orthologous (homologous) sequences. Sequences
should be aligned beforehand, e.g. using the program SCAN2 (http-J/
softberry.com/scan.html). To run NsiteH, three input files are
required (two query sequences and their alignment). In comparison to
Nsite, this program identifies functional motifs that demonstrate a
certain level of similarity between RE motifs in two query sequences.

NsiteM searches for statistically significant RE motifs observed
in many homologous sequences. This condition serves as an add-
itional criterion for selecting putative REs. By comparison with
Nsite, this program applies one additional search parameter—a min-
imal portion of query sequences containing the same RE motif. As
input data, it requires two or more sequences in FASTA format.

Descriptions of output results of these programs are presented in
Supplementary Figures 52—S4 (Supplementary Material S1) and their
algorithms are outlined in Supplementary Material S4.

Testing Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM on plant and animal sequences
indicates that these programs can reliably identify known REs of pro-
moters. For example, applying NsiteH for analysis of promoter regions
of the orthologous Cab-E and Lhcb1 "5 genes encoding the chlorophyll
a/b-binding protein in Nicotiana plumbaginifolia and Nicotiana syl-
vestris, we identified a set of evolutionarily conservative REs (Fig. 1).
The predicted GT-1 binding sites (RSP00741 and RSP00742) and G-
box (CG-1 binding site; RSP01160) are involved in the photoregula-
tion of plant genes and are known to be functional in the Lhcb1*5
gene of N.plumbaginifolia (Schindler and Cashmore, 1990).

3 Conclusion

The Nsite, NsiteH and NsiteM computer tool for identification of REs
in promoter sequences is widely used by researchers, accessible through
the Softberry and KAUST Bioinformatics WEB servers (www.soft
berry.com and www.molquest.kaust.edu.sa), and is cited in N200 re-
search articles (according to Google Scholar). Nsite is applied for iden-
tification of RE patterns in a single query sequence. Nevertheless,
reliable detection of short functional motifs increases when we account
for sequence conservation in homologs promoters from different or-
ganisms. NsiteH is designed for analysis of orthologous genes’ pro-
moters. NsiteM detects REs involved in the coordinated expression
regulation of a group of genes. Our programs provide possibility to

ABSTRACT

Summary: Accurate identification of significant aberrations in can-
cers (AISAIC) is a systematic effort to discover potential cancer-driving
genes such as oncogenes and tumor suppressors. Two major con-
founding factors against this goal are the normal cell contamination
and random background aberrations in tumor samples. We describe a
Java AISAIC package that provides comprehensive analytic functions
and graphic user interface for integrating two statistically principled in
silico approaches to address the aforementioned challenges in DNA
copy number analyses. In addition, the package provides a com-
mand-line interface for users with scripting and programming needs
to incorporate or extend AISAIC to their customized analysis pipelines.
This open-source multiplatform software offers several attractive fea-
tures: (i) it implements a user friendly complete pipeline from process-
ing raw data to reporting analytic results; (ii) it detects deletion types
directly from copy number signals using a Bayes hypothesis test; (iii) it
estimates the fraction of normal contamination for each sample; (iv) it
produces unbiased null distribution of random background alterations
by iterative aberration-exclusive permutations; and (v) it identifies
significant consensus regions and the percentage of homozygous/
hemizygous deletions across multiple samples. AISAIC also provides
users with a parallel computing option to leverage ubiquitous multicore
machines.

application, with a user’s guide and source code, at https://code.

1 INTRODUCTION

Somatic DNA copy number alterations (CNAs) are important
structural variants present in almost all human cancers.
Oligonucleotide-based single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays provide a cost-effective technique to acquire high-density
and allelic-speciﬁc copy number data for large-scale cancer stu-
dies. The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) project represents an
integrated attempt to acquire multiplatform genomic and mo-
lecular proﬁles on 20—25 cancer types each with hundreds of
samples, where the AffymetriX Genome-Wide Human SNP
Array 6.0 serves as the common platform for acquiring SNP
and CNA data on these cancer types (Beroukhim et al., 2010;
Carter et al., 2012).

Accurate identiﬁcation of signiﬁcant aberrations in cancers
(AISAIC) is a systematic effort to identify potential cancer-
driving genes by locating signiﬁcant consensus CNA regions
and detecting deletion types. Two major confounding factors
against this goal are the normal cell contamination and
random background aberrations in tumor samples. Moreover,
simple permutation of CNAs would produce a biased null dis-
tribution of random background aberrations due to the contam-
ination by the unknown yet true consensus CNAs. To address
these challenges, we developed AISAIC by integrating and
streamlining two statistically principled approaches: Bayesian
Analysis of COpy number Mixtures (BACOM) for detecting de-
letion types and estimating normal cell proportions directly from
copy number data (Yu et al., 2011), and Signiﬁcant Aberration
in Cancer (SAIC) for identifying signiﬁcant consensus CNA re-
gions (Yuan et al., 2012). In addition to the unique functional-
ities summarized in the abstract, AISAIC further provides the
following unique new features: (i) AISAIC is a self-contained
DNA copy number analysis tool implementing the entire ana-
lysis pipeline, from preprocessing raw data to reporting signiﬁ-
cant consensus aberrations (SCAs) results with gene annotations
and visualization, and it provides a user-friendly ‘one-click’
solution without dependence on other software packages;

(ii) AISAIC naturally integrates BACOM and SAIC and signiﬁ-
cantly enhances the accuracy of identifying SCAs when com-
pared with competing methods (even when compared with
SAIC alone); (iii) AISAIC adopts concurrent computing tech-
niques to take advantage of multicore/multiprocessor architec-
ture found in most modern computers, which greatly reduces
computation time, especially when handling large datasets.

The AISAIC package was tested using both simulation and
real datasets, and the experimental results show that the inte-
grated application of BACOM and SAIC to clinical samples
can signiﬁcantly improve the power to detect signiﬁcant consen-
sus CNA regions and produce biologically plausible ﬁndings
warranting further studies.

Here, we describe a Java package that provides comprehensive
analytical functions, a graphical user interface (GUI) and result
visualization for disseminating the uniﬁed software of BACOM-
SAIC algorithms to the cancer research community and beyond.
In addition, this open-source and multiplatform software also
provides a command-line interface for users with scripting and
programming needs to incorporate or extend AISAIC to their
customized analysis pipelines, and offers the users with a parallel
computing option using ubiquitous multicore machines and con-
current fork/join framework in Java SE 7. We apply the AISAIC
package to the glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and lung adeno-
carcinoma (LUAD) datasets in TCGA and report various
analysis results.

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Methods and software

BACOM ﬁrst detects deletion segments using established allelic-speciﬁc
analysis tools comprising genotype calling, signal normalization and de-
letion loci detection. A Bayes classiﬁer is then used to identify each seg-
ment’s deletion type (homozygous versus heterozygous deletions) directly
from copy number signals. Finally, BACOM estimates both the fraction
of normal cells in a tumor sample and the cancer-speciﬁc copy number
proﬁle. As a completely unsupervised approach, BACOM allows param-
eters of the underlying deletion-type conditioned probability models to be
readily estimated from measured copy number signals, without any
knowledge of the associated deletion type. First, SAIC deﬁnes CNA
units by exploiting intrinsic correlation among consecutive probes and
then assigns a score to each CNA unit instead of single probes based on
both the amplitude and frequency of the signals within the unit. Next, to
estimate the unbiased null distribution of random background aberra-
tions, SAIC performs permutations on CNA units that iteratively exclude
detected aberrations yet preserve correlations inherent in the copy
number data. Finally, SAIC identiﬁes signiﬁcant consensus CNA regions
based on adjusted P-values.

The AISAIC package is implemented entirely as a Java application.
The illustrative ﬂowchart given in Figure 1 provides an overview of the
software architecture design. The AISAIC software contains two major
analytic modules (BACOM and SAIC). Through a user-friendly graph-
ical user interface, users can easily import data, assign proper parameter
values and select their preferred analysis routes via the ‘BACOM’, ‘SAIC’
or ‘BACOM+SAIC’ options. AISAIC then takes raw data CEL ﬁles
(e.g. Affymetrix SNP arrays) as its input and outputs various intermedi-
ate and exportable results to users, including normal cell fractions, dele-
tion types (hemizygous/homozygous) and their percentages, signiﬁcant
consensus CNA regions and embedded gene lists.

The AISAIC package offers users parallel computing capabilities,
taking full advantage of ubiquitous multicore CPUs and multiprocessor

machines. To enable convenient concurrent computing, AISAIC adopts
the widely embraced concurrent Fork/Join framework recently intro-
duced in Java SE 7 and implements a hierarchy of multithreads.
Speciﬁcally, two threads are used to analyze two chromosomes concur-
rently; ampliﬁcation and deletion CNAs in each chromosome are ana-
lyzed via two threads simultaneously; and multiple threads are invoked to
perform parallel permutations with each focused on a subgroup of the
samples.

2.2 Case study on TCGA datasets

The AISAIC package has been tested on multiple TCGA datasets and
runs successfully on both Microsoft Windows and Linux platforms. On
the GBM dataset that contains 513 paired samples, the AISAIC analysis
reveals biologically relevant regions that encompass many well-known
oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes including MDM4, AKT3,
MYCN, PIK3CA, PDGFRA, EGFR, KRAS, CDKN2A/B and
PTEN, and novel consensus regions that may warrant further studies.
To assess biological and clinical implications of signiﬁcant consensus
deletions, AISAIC also provides the frequencies of homo- and hemi-
deletions in the sample population, e.g. CDKN2A/B exhibits high
homo-deletion rates among others. Figure 2 displays the P-values
(in —log10 scale) of aberrations, where the dashed lines indicate the sig-
niﬁcance cutoff at the adjusted P-value of 0.05, and (%l%) are the rates
of homo- and hemi-deletions, respectively. On the LUAD dataset
(405 paired samples), the AISAIC analysis, again is highly consistent
with previous reports, conﬁrming many known cancer-related genes
such as TERT, EGFR, KRAS, CDK4, CCNEl, CDKN2A/B, RBl,
TP53 and CCBEl. In a comparative study on the GBM and LUAD
datasets, AISAIC identiﬁes several common genes such as EGFR,
KRAS, CDK4, MDM2, CCNEl and CDKN2A/B, as well as some

cancer type-speciﬁc genes such as a high AKT3 ampliﬁcation rate in
GBM and a high TP53 deletion rate in LUAD.

Detailed descriptions of method, software and more case studies on
real copy number data are included in the Supplementary Material.

3 DISCUSSION

AISAIC presents a comprehensive and unsupervised approach
to analyze DNA copy number aberrations in the cancer genome.
AISAIC is supported by a well-grounded statistical framework
and can detect homo/hemi-deletion types and rates, estimate and
correct normal cell contamination, and identify signiﬁcant con-
sensus CNA regions. Tested on both simulations and TCGA
datasets, AISAIC is effective at revealing novel consensus regions
that harbor potential cancer ‘driver’ genes and enhancers. We
expect that, with further development, AISAIC’s methodology
can be applied to other forms of genomic and epigenetic data
such as DNA methylations (de Assis et al., 2012).

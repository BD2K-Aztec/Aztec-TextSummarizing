ABSTRACT

Motivation: The size and complex nature of mass spectrometry-
based proteomics datasets motivate development of specialized soft-
ware for statistical data analysis and exploration. We present DanteR,
a graphical R package that features extensive statistical and diagnos-
tic functions for quantitative proteomics data analysis, including nor-
malization, imputation, hypothesis testing, interactive visualization and
peptide-to-protein rollup. More importantly, users can easily extend
the existing functionality by including their own algorithms under the
Add-On tab.

Availability: DanteR and its associated user guide are available for
download free of charge at http://omics.pnl.gov/software/. We have an
updated binary source for the DanteR package up on our website
together with a vignettes document. For Windows, a single click
automatically installs DanteR along with the R programming environ-
ment. For Linux and Mac OS X, users must install R and then follow
instructions on the DanteR website for package installation.

1 INTRODUCTION

Analysis of proteomics data, such as based on liquid chromato-
graphy-mass spectrometry, presents special challenges due to a
number of factors, including sample variation and missing pep-
tide abundances, as well as the need to perform protein-level
signiﬁcance analysis on peptide-level data (Karpievitch et al.,
2009a; Nesvizhskii, 2010). Existing non-commercial software
for proteomics analysis, such as GProX (Rigbolt, 2011, http://
bit.ly/PkBSWj) and DanTE (Polpitiya et al., 2008), uses multiple
programming languages (e.g. R and C#) that make additional
development and maintenance difﬁcult. Moreover, these tools
lack the ﬂexibility and extensibility needed to allow end users
to add new functionality.

DanteR is a graphical R package for quantitative bottom—up
proteomics data analysis designed to overcome these limitations;
implementation entirely in R makes for an independent and read-
ily extensible data analysis platform. Although the software can

be installed and used as a stand-alone program, user-deﬁned algo-
rithms can be easily integrated to extend data analysis and
visualization.

2 DESCRIPTION

DanteR incorporates algorithms for preprocessing and normal-
izing peptide abundances, statistical analysis, multi-dimensional
visualization and for creating publication analysis summaries.
These features build on earlier DAnTE software (Polpitiya
et al., 2008), but with additional functionalities such as
EigenMS normalization (i.e. normalization using singular value
decomposition), model-based ﬁltering of low-quality peptides,
likelihood model-based imputation of missing values and im-
proved signiﬁcance analysis at peptide and protein levels.

2.1 Data format and metadata

DanteR tracks contextual information (metadata) about rows
and columns of data tables. Input data can be any data table
(crosstab) containing rows and columns of peptide abundances;
supported ﬁle formats include tab-delimited text ﬁles, SQLite
and Excel. Rows correspond to distinct peptides and columns
correspond to peptide abundances in different experimental sam-
ples. Additional columns may contain information on peptide
and protein identities, pathway information, etc. Metadata,
also called factors in statistics, can be loaded from a ﬁle, either
manually speciﬁed within DanteR or automatically generated
from input experiment names. For example, one might use meta-
data to track the experimental treatment conditions for various
samples. As data are transformed and analyzed, DanteR keeps
track of data-to-metadata while ﬁltering to remove low-quality
peptides, normalizing abundances or “rolling up’ peptide abun-
dance information to the protein level.

2.2 Exploratory and statistical features

DanteR provides multiple investigative and diagnostic plots that
include consistent factor coloring, dynamic zoom and column
rearrangement (Fig. 1A). For unsupervised data exploration,
DanteR can perform principal component analysis (with asso-
ciated score and loading plots) as a method for ﬁnding major
sources of variation in the data along with hierarchical and

arguments

K-means clustering methods. All principal component analysis
components can be displayed as interactive 3D plots, optionally
with conﬁdence ellipsoids around each point. Another new fea-
ture is interactive display of cross-tabulated data that can be
accomplished using the Dynamic Row Plot function, which
allows for fast and deep exploration (e.g. plotting all peptide
abundances within given sets of proteins as heatmaps or line
plots). Proteins can be sorted and plotted by P—value from hy-
pothesis testing, K-means clustering group, etc. Finally, results of
statistical tests can be explored using an interactive volcano plot
function (Fig. 1B). All of the plots can be saved in a variety of
high-resolution graphic ﬁle formats.

DanteR also incorporates several robust normalization meth-
ods. Among these are the new EigenMS normalization method
based on singular value decomposition (Karpievitch et al.,
2009b), as well as existing methods that have been streamlined
and simpliﬁed, e.g. robust linear, LOESS, quantile and median
absolute deviation regression (Callister et al., 2006). For missing
value imputation, DanteR offers simple and advanced algo-
rithms, including K-nearest neighbor imputation, KNNimpute
(Troyanskaya et al., 2001) and likelihood model-based

imputation for randomly missing/censored abundance values
(Karpievitch et al., 2009a).

Parametric (ANOVA) and non-parametric (Fisher’s exact)
statistical tests afford signiﬁcance analysis capability. For
ANOVA analysis, users can specify a linear model, a robust
linear model for noisy data or a Poisson model for count data.
Protein-level inference can be performed utilizing all of the avail-
able peptide abundances and a likelihood ratio test to compute
P—values (Karpievitch et al., 2009a). Fisher’s exact test can be
used for signiﬁcance analysis of peptide count data. Signiﬁcant
up or down protein expression changes can be summarized by
using the tabulation function.

The ‘Add-On’ menu allows users to append new functions to
DanteR by creating R scripts that contain the algorithm and a
dialog speciﬁcation with a simple markup scheme (see the
RGtk2Extras R package, http://bit.ly/MM6dee). In this way,
anyone with R knowledge can extend DanteR without knowing
user interface programming. Figure 1C shows a user-created
function ‘random.matrix’ that produces a matrix of size given
by the parameters passed through a dialogue window. When this
script is placed into the dedicated add-on directory, an additional
menu item for the dialog is automatically created. Function
output is automatically saved as a new data table in the user
workspace.

3 SUMMARY

DanteR is entirely R-based software that incorporates many al-
gorithms for proteomics data analysis. Moreover, its capabilities
are readily extendible by end users and developers without any
knowledge of user interface programming. While designed spe-
ciﬁcally for analyzing proteomics data, DanteR can also be
applied to analyze microarray and other -omics data from mul-
tiple sources.

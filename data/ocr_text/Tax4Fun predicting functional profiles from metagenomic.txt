Abstract

Motivation: The characterization of phylogenetic and functional diversity is a key element in the
analysis of microbial communities. Amplicon-based sequencing of marker genes, such as 165
rRNA, is a powerful tool for assessing and comparing the structure of microbial communities at a
high phylogenetic resolution. Because 16$ rRNA sequencing is more cost-effective than whole
metagenome shotgun sequencing, marker gene analysis is frequently used for broad studies that
involve a large number of different samples. However, in comparison to shotgun sequencing
approaches, insights into the functional capabilities of the community get lost when restricting the
analysis to taxonomic assignment of 165 rRNA data.

Results: Tax4Fun is a software package that predicts the functional capabilities of microbial com-
munities based on 165 rRNA datasets. We evaluated Tax4Fun on a range of paired metagenome/
16$ rRNA datasets to assess its performance. Our results indicate that Tax4Fun provides a good
approximation to functional profiles obtained from metagenomic shotgun sequencing approaches.
Availability and implementation: Tax4Fun is an open-source R package and applicable to output
as obtained from the SlLVAngs web server or the application of OIIME with a SILVA database ex-
tension. Tax4Fun is freely available for download at http://tax4fun.gobics.de/.

Amplicon—based sequencing of marker genes is widely used for
large-scale studies that involve many different sampling sites or time
series. The common 16S rRNA gene-based analysis is a powerful
tool for assessing the phylogenetic distribution of a metagenome but
does not provide insights into the communities metabolic potential.
Therefore, the prediction of the functional capabilities of a microbial
community based on marker gene data would be highly beneficial.
As a particular difficulty of such a predictive approach for most or-
ganisms in marker gene databases the genome and therefore the
functional repertoire is not known. For instance, the SILVA SSU
rRNA database (Quast et al., 2013) (SILVA 115 full release)

(Kanehisa et al., 2014) only comprises 2982 complete prokaryotic
genomes.

In a previous study (ABhauer and Meinicke, 2013), we intro-
duced a statistical method for predicting the metabolic profiles of a
metagenome from its taxonomic composition using a linear combin-
ation of precomputed genomic reference profiles. A similar method
has been proposed for inference of the community structure from re-
mote sensing satellite image models (Larsen et al., 2015). In this ap-
proach, the average EC number counts of all annotated genomes
from a given taxonomic group, e.g. at order level, are used as refer-
ence for the linear combination of the community structure at this

level. Recently, the PICRUSt approach was proposed to predict
KEGG Ortholog (KO) functional profiles of microbial communities
using 16S rRNA gene sequences (Langille et al., 2013). PICRUSt
infers unknown gene content by an extended ancestral state recon-
struction algorithm. The algorithm uses a phylogenetic tree of 16S
rRNA gene sequences to link operational taxonomic units (OTUs)
with gene content. Thus, PICRUSt predictions depend on the top-
ology of the tree and the distance to the next sequenced organism.
Because a nearest neighbor within the tree topology always exists,
PICRUSt links all OTUs, even if distances are large. This procedure
can be problematic when analyzing microbial communities with a
large proportion of so far not well-characterized phyla.

Here, we present Tax4Fun, a novel tool for functional commu-
nity profiling based on 16S rRNA data. In Tax4Fun the linking of
16S rRNA gene sequences with the functional annotation of
sequenced prokaryotic genomes is realized with a nearest neighbor
identification based on a minimum 16S rRNA sequence similarity.
Tax4Fun can be applied to the output of 16S rRNA analysis pipe-
lines that can perform a mapping of 16S rRNA gene reads to
SILVA. The results of Tax4Fun indicate that the correlation of func-
tional predictions with the metagenome profile is higher as com-
pared to the PICRUSt tool.

2 Implementation

Our method provides a prediction of functional profiles on the basis
of SILVA-labeled OTU abundances. After preprocessing and cluster-
ing of the 16S rRNA sequencing reads the resulting OTUs have to
be assigned to reference sequences in the SILVA database. The
SILVA assignment counts are then transformed to functional pro-
files using Tax4Fun, which proceeds in three steps.

First, the SILVA-based 16S rRNA profile is transformed to a
taxonomic profile of the prokaryotic KEGG organisms. The linear
transformation is realized by a precomputed association matrix (see
Supplementary Material section 2.1.1). Then, the estimated abun-
dances of KEGG organisms are normalized by the 16S rRNA copy
number obtained from the NCBI genome annotations. Finally, the
normalized taxonomic abundances are used to linearly combine the
precomputed functional profiles of the KEGG organisms for the pre-
diction of the functional profile of the microbial community.

The organism-specific reference profiles are estimated with the
same method as used for the Taxy-Pro reference profiles
(Klingenberg et al., 2013). For a fast computation of the organism-
specific and metagenomic functional KEGG Ortholog (KO) profiles,
we utilized UProC (Meinicke, 2015) and PAUDA (Huson and Xie,
2014), respectively (see Supplementary Material section 2.1.2).

3 Results

We applied Tax4Fun and PICRUSt to a collection of paired metage-
nome/16S rRNA datasets that have also been used in the original
PICRUSt study (Fierer et al., 2012; Harris et al., 2013; Human
Microbiome Project Consortium, 2012; Kunin et al., 2008; Muegge
et al., 2011) (see Supplementary Material section 1.1). Before apply-
ing Tax4Fun, the SILVA-based 16S rRNA profiles were computed
using the QIIME tool (Caporaso et al., 2010) or the SILVAngs web
server (Quast et al., 2013), respectively (see Supplementary Material
section 2.2 and 2.3). For each paired dataset, the Spearman correl-
ation of the whole metagenome and the 16S rRNA-predicted rela-
tive KO abundance profile was calculated. For the computation of
the correlation, we excluded for each dataset all KO profile

dimensions that did not contribute any non-zero count in the func-
tional profiles. The resulting correlation coefficients are shown in
Figure 1 for the UProC—based functional profiles. Using Tax4Fun,
the median of the correlation coefficient varies between 0.8706
(soils) and 0.6427 (Guerrero Negro hypersaline microbial mat).

In comparison with PICRUSt the correlation of Tax4Fun is sig-
nificantly higher for all four datasets according to a nonparametric
sign test (P-value<0.001). Similar results are obtained using the
PAUDA tool for estimation of the functional profiles (see
Supplementary Material section 4.2).

Further, we compared the coverage of the analysis pipelines in
terms of the fraction of reads that were classified by QIIME/
SILVAngs and the percentage of OTUs that were mapped to KEGG
organisms using Tax4Fun. Especially for the soil samples, we
observed rather low fractions of 16S rRNA sequences that were fi-
nally used to predict the functional profiles (SILVAngs: 0.02%,
Tax4Fun: 4.78%; QIIME: 95.21%, Tax4Fun: 55.36%). Contrary,
the coverage for the human microbiome and mammalian guts data-
sets is rather high for both QIIME/SILVAngs and Tax4Fun
(SILVAngs: 95%, Tax4Fun 95%).

In our study, the soil samples are probably the most complex com-
munities under investigation. Further, our results revealed that mem-
bers of the soil communities are poorly represented in the KEGG
database. However, even when applying SILVAngs+Tax4Fun, the
median of the correlation coefficients was rather high using merely a
fraction of the reads to predict the functional profiles. Thus, a high
correlation coefficient does not necessarily indicate the completeness
of the estimated functional repertoire but rather provides a measure
of correspondence between the whole metagenome and the 16S
rRNA-predicted KO abundances.

Therefore, the prediction accuracy is not a function of sample di-
versity but rather depends on a good correspondence between or-
ganisms in genome and 16S rRNA databases. Even though a sample
is very diverse good predictions can be obtained in case that many of
the detected organisms or close relatives are available in both data-
bases. In contrast, the predicted functional profile of samples with
large fractions of unknown organisms can be expected to be incom-
plete due to the low coverage of database reference profiles. Thus,
the coverage of the taxonomic assignments should always be in-
spected to check the reliability of the predictions, in particular when

using SILVAngs. For all datasets, the coverage values are provided
in the Supplementary Excel File.

4 Conclusion

Tax4Fun predicts the functional profile of a microbial community
just from 16S rRNA sequence data. Our approach cannot replace
whole metagenome profiling but is useful to supplement 16S rRNA
analyses in metagenome pre-studies or in situations where shotgun
sequencing is prohibitively expensive, e.g. for broad surveys in mi-
crobial ecology applications.

We evaluated our method on four paired data collections from
different habitats and compared it to the PICRUSt tool. The results
indicate a high correlation of the predicted Tax4Fun profiles with
the corresponding functional profiles obtained from whole metage-
nome sequence data. Moreover, the results show that Tax4Fun out-
performs PICRUSt on all test datasets. Additionally, our results
revealed for all datasets a higher correlation between the metage-
nomic and 16S-predicted functional profiles when using UProC in
comparison to the PAUDA tool (see Supplementary Material section
3 Figure Sl—S3).

Although we provide functional reference profiles from both
tools for Tax4Fun, we recommend the usage of Tax4Fun in combin-
ation with the UProC-based reference profiles for prediction because
of the higher sensitivity of UProC.

Tax4Fun allows easy processing of the output from SILVAngs,
QIIME or any other analysis pipeline using the SILVA database as
reference. The implementation in R facilitates further statistical ana-
lyses of the Tax4Fun predictions, which can be processed within the
same R environment.

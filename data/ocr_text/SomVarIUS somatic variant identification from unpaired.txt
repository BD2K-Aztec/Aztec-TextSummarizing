Abstract

Motivation: Somatic variant calling typically requires paired tumor-normal tissue samples. Yet,
paired normal tissues are not always available in clinical settings or for archival samples.

Results: We present SomVarlUS, a computational method for detecting somatic variants using
high throughput sequencing data from unpaired tissue samples. We evaluate the performance of
the method using genomic data from synthetic and real tumor samples. SomVarlUS identifies
somatic variants in exome-seq data of ~150 >< coverage with at least 67.7% precision and 64.6% re-
call rates, when compared with paired-tissue somatic variant calls in real tumor samples. We dem-
onstrate the utility of SomVarlUS by identifying somatic mutations in formalin-fixed samples, and
tracking clonal dynamics of oncogenic mutations in targeted deep sequencing data from pre- and
post-treatment leukemia samples.

Availability and implementation: SomVarlUS is written in Python 2.7 and available at http://www.

1 Introduction

Assessment of somatic and germ line mutations to tailor personal-
ized diagnosis and treatment is becoming a corner stone for preci-
sion medicine in oncology initiatives (Collins and Varmus, 2015;
Sboner and Elemento, 2015). Somatic mutations are typically de-
tected by comparing sequencing data from target (e.g. tumor) and
matched control tissues (e.g. benign tissue from the same patient).
Initiatives such as the ICGC-TCGA DREAM Genomic Mutation
Calling Challenge have shown that popular algorithms can detect
somatic mutations from paired tumor-normal tissue samples with
reasonably high accuracy (Boutros et al., 2014). However, in many
practical situations matched control tissues are not available, and it
remains challenging to distinguish between somatic and germ line
variants in those cases. For instance, matched normal samples are

not routinely obtained in clinical care (Meric-Bernstam et al., 2015).
Additionally, a considerable proportion of the older FFPE and fresh
frozen tumor samples have no matched control tissues available.
Popular variant calling tools are not designed to identify somatic
and germ line variants from unpaired tissue samples, and there have
been only limited efforts to detect somatic mutations from unpaired
samples (Sun et al., 2014).

We present SomVarIUS, a computational method for detecting
somatic variants using high throughput sequencing data from un-
paired tissue samples. SomVarIUS accepts sorted alignment files
(.bam) as input, and outputs predicted somatic mutations in the
variant call format (.vcf), thereby enabling its easy integration
into any standard genome analysis pipeline. It also generates an op-
tional output providing information about the status of known

cancer/disease-associated mutations in the sample. We first describe
the method, before showing its application by identifying somatic
mutations in FFPE samples, and tracking clonal dynamics of onco-
genic mutations in pre- and post-treatment leukemia samples.

2 Methods

The SomVarIUS workﬂow is shown in Figure 1A. The working
principle of the framework is that, non-reference bases in high-
throughput sequencing reads mapped to a genomic site are probably
of germ line or somatic origin, or indicate sequencing error
(Fig. 1B). Therefore, one can identify potential somatic mutations
after calculating probabilities that the observed, non-reference bases
at that site are unlikely due to sequencing error and are also not
germ line SNPs. Accordingly, the SomVarIUS workﬂow, as outlined
in Figure 1A, involves three key steps—initial data pre-processing to
prioritize potential variant sites, estimation of the probability of
sequencing error and also the probability of observing a germ line
SNP at those sites.

In the pre-processing step, SomVarIUS applies multiple filters to
prioritize variants. The pipeline excludes the reads that have low
mapping quality (default 355), low base quality at that position
(default 3 13), and those which are not proper pairs (for paired end

sequencing). The genomic locations that overlap with SNPs in
dbSNP (v142), have low coverage (default 3 10), or have very few
reads supporting the non-reference allele (default 3 4) in the pileup
are not evaluated for somatic mutation discovery. Duplicate reads
can be optionally removed.

The subsequent step involves additional filters and ascertainment
of the variant alleles. Major and minor alleles are identified based
on their respective allele frequencies; if multiple non-reference bases
are present in the pileup at a genomic location, the top two alleles in
terms of allelic abundance are considered. While detecting somatic
substitution, the reads that harbor base insertions and deletions in
the pileup at that particular genomic site are not considered (e.g. do
not contribute to allelic abundance estimation). The non-reference
allele is required to have a high mean base quality (default Phred
score: 225). Strand bias is estimated using the published SB score
(Guo et al., 2012). Both alleles should be supported by reads map-
ping to both the forward and reverse strand, and have low strand
bias (default: 20.8) score (Guo et al., 2012), since extreme strand
bias typically indicates a potential false positive.

Thereafter, SomVarIUS utilizes information from base quality
scores, coverage information and applies Chernoff bound (Chernoff,
1952), to determine the probability of sequencing error at a genomic
position using an approach similar to that of Bansal (2010). In brief,
let a genomic base position be covered by 11 reads, of which 5 reads

are supporting the alternate allele. Let {Q,-} be the quality scores of
the base calls for the 11 reads at that position where 1 S i S 11.
Assuming base calls are independent between reads, and by model-
ing their sequencing error probabilities as n independent Bernoulli
trials, we can compute the mean expected sequencing error at that
genomic position as 1122,10—0'1 X Q,. The probability of the sum
X 2 X1 + X2 +  + X" of n independent Bernoulli random variables
deviating from its mean u is bounded by Chernoff’s equation
(Bansal, 2010; Chernoff, 1952).

Pr[X > (1 + 5),u] <

 

e‘5 M

(1 + (W)

If we apply the transformation, 5 = (1 + 5),u, then this probability,
denoted as pS indicates the upper bound of the probability of
observing 5 out of 11 reads covering the base position to support the
alternate allele due to sequencing error alone. In SomVarIUS, a
threshold for probability of sequencing error, given the other filters
mentioned above, helps prioritize high confidence biological
variants.

Next, SomVarIUS estimates the probability of observing a poten-
tial germ line SNP given the allelic abundance of the major and
minor alleles, in addition to information about known germ line het-
erozygous SNPs in the neighborhood (Fig. 1C). It first interrogates
the known SNP positions from the input file, and identifies those,
which are heterozygous in the sample based on detection of both the
reference and alternate alleles. We used the SNPs from dbSNP V142
after excluding the COSMIC variants. But a user may choose to pro-
vide an alternate SNP file (e.g. 1000 Genome SNPs with population
allele frequency >5%) as input. A SNP position is classified as het-
erozygous if both the reference and alternate alleles are detected
with sufficient read support (e.g. default: >4 reads supporting both
alleles; or higher than that expected due to sequencing error).
SomVarIUS then utilizes those positions to model the distribution of
allelic abundance for the heterozygous SNPs in the sequencing data
using a beta-binomial distribution, where for the read count for the
alternate allele, Y, the model is

Y|cx, [f N BetaBinomial(n, or, [3)

where n is the number of reads covering the base position, and or, [f
are beta binomial model parameters. The model parameters (or, [3)
are estimated using the method of moments (Tripathi et al., 1994).
SomVarIUS takes into account local copy number status implicitly
based on allelic abundance of heterozygous germ line SNPs for the
entire chromosomes or genomic segments within each chromosome.
For instance, at a triploid locus allelic abundance for the germ line,
minor allele is expected to be N033 and not 0.5, as expected in the
diploid regions. If a copy number segmentation file is provided as an
input (optional), the beta-binomial distribution is fitted to each gen-
omic segment to account for locus-specific copy number status and
other biases. Next, this distribution is used to evaluate the germ line
mutation status of other candidate positions in the genomic seg-
ment. If at a candidate genomic position, the allelic abundance of
the minor allele is at the tail of the beta-binomial distribution for the
underlying genomic segment, this position will have a small prob-
ability (pg) to be a germ line variant. The beta-binomial allows us to
model over-dispersion of allelic abundance in the sequencing data
based on information from the genomic segment. However, if the
number of heterozygous common SNPs in the segment is small (<5),
pg is computed based on binomial distribution or beta-binomial con-
structed using heterozygous germ line SNPs built from the entire
chromosome. A threshold for pg i.e. probability of observing a germ

line SNP, given the other filters mentioned above, helps prioritize
variants that are unlikely to be germ line variants.

We classify a genomic position to harbor somatic mutation, if
that position has a small sequencing error probability (default:
1), < 1E-05) as well as a small probability to be a germ line variant
((default: pg< 5E — 02). The output somatic variants are reported in
the vcf format. SomVarIUS also provides additional information,
which could be useful in applied settings. First, SomVarIUS accepts
an optional high throughput sequencing dataset (e.g. RNAseq,
WGS, WES, or targeted deep sequencing) for the same sample, as
optional input to add further evidence in support of the variant allele
calling. It has been demonstrated that an integrated analysis of RNA
and DNA can help detect mutations with high sensitivity and preci-
sion (Radenbaugh et al., 2014), and our results also corroborate
that notion. Second, when a catalog of known oncogenic/disease
associated variants (e.g. mutations conferring drug-resistance) is
provided as an optional input, SomVarIUS interrogates those pos-
itions, and if the disease-associated alleles are detected in the sample,
they are reported in a separate vcf file. The output file reports the
variants with appropriate annotations (i.e. even if they are present
below detection threshold, or are potentially germ line). Finally, it
models allele frequency distributions of the somatic mutations using
a Gaussian mixture model, fitted using an expectation maximization
algorithm, and reports if the observed mutations are likely to be clo-
nal or sub-clonal. Tissue purity estimates, if provided as optional in-
put can help to provide a refined estimate. SomVarIUS is written in
Python 2.7. The default parameter settings and filters are meant to
improve the quality of predictions, but those options can be changed
in a user-defined way depending on the application.

We evaluated SomVarIUS using data from synthetic tumor data-
sets and real tumor sample from the Cancer Genome Atlas
(Weinstein et al., 2013). For the TCGA samples, we compared our
results with those reported by Mutect (Cibulskis et al., 2013) and
VarScan2 (Koboldt et al., 2012). In certain cases, VarScan2 classi-
fied a variant as ‘germ line’ even if the position is bi/multi-allelic in
the tumor but mono-allelic in the paired normal sample; we reclassi-
fied them as somatic mutations.

3 Results

3.1 Assessment using synthetic tumor mutation data

We first evaluated the utility of SomVarIUS using synthetic tumor
genomics data with spiked in ‘true’ somatic mutations using pub-
lished approaches (Boutros et al., 2014). In brief, we selected a nor-
mal, non-malignant, blood-derived high coverage (~150><) whole
exome sequencing dataset for the sample NA12878 from the 1000
Genomes Project. Next, using this as a template for bamsurgeon
(Ewing et al., 2015) we spiked in 192 somatic mutations to create a
synthetic tumor genome (Fig. 2A), such that it had ~60% tumor

purity and contained minor sub-clones with ~40% clonal contribu-
tions. Details of the spiked in somatic mutations are provided in the
Supplementary Table S1. Using default parameter settings of
SomVarIUS v1.1 on this synthetic tumor sample, we were able to de-
tect 154 (80.2%) true positives, but also there were 85 false posi-
tives and 38 false negatives (Fig. 2B). Majority of the false positives
was misclassified germ line variants that had abnormally imbal-
anced read support for the two alleles (Supplementary Table S1),
while most of the false negative cases had low base quality for the
variant alleles in the synthetic tumor sample. This analysis indicates
that, SomVarIUS can detect somatic mutations with reasonable ac-
curacy from a high coverage, synthetic, unpaired tumor dataset.
VarScan, in the single sample variant calling mode, called 276 990
variants, which included all of the 192 spiked mutations, and also
all the predicted somatic mutations reported by SomVarIUS.

To assess the performance of SomVarIUS for low coverage sam-
ples, we selected another synthetic tumor sample with ~30>< whole
genome sequencing data from the ICGC-DREAM Mutation Calling
Challenge (synthetic tumor dataset 2; Boutros et al., 2014). This
synthetic sample was monoclonal and had ~80% tumor purity.
Coefficient of variation of allelic abundance of reference and alter-
nate alleles at known germ line heterozygous SNP positions was
high, which is typical of low coverage datasets. Therefore, we ran
SomVarIUS using a weaker pg threshold (pg < 2E — 01). Out of
4 102 true single nucleotide somatic variants spiked in autosomal
chromosomes in the synthetic genome, we were able to detect 2968
variants (72.35%) using SomVarIUS unpaired sample analysis.
Majority of the spiked in ‘true’ somatic mutations had allelic abun-
dance within a very narrow range around ~0.35. SomVarIUS also
reported 15 433 false positives, majority of which (>90%) were mis-
classified germ line SNPs (i.e. variant also detected in the normal
sub-bam) that had skewed allelic abundance of the reference and al-
ternate alleles. A vast majority of these misclassified germ line vari-
ants had allelic abundance for the minor allele much lower than the
true somatic mutations in the sample (>90% somatic mutations had
allelic abundance between 0.33 and 0.375). So in retrospect, the low
precision was not necessarily a consequence of the weak pg thresh-
old; it would be difficult to filter the germ line derived false positives
in a low coverage dataset.

Taken together, our analysis using synthetic tumor data suggests
that SomVarIUS can detect somatic mutations with a reasonable re-
call rate from unpaired tumor samples, but samples with sufficient
sequencing coverage would be recommended to obtain high recall as
well as a high precision-rate. In some cases, it is possible to improve
the performance further by tailoring the filters for a given dataset.
For instance, in the NA12878 analysis, both precision and recall
rates improved when only high coverage positions (depth of cover-
age >50; read support for alternate allele >10) were considered.
But, assuming that, in general, no or limited prior information is
available for the unpaired samples (except probably depth of cover-
age, average sequencing quality, etc.), we do not report these results.
But, whenever possible using additional information (e.g. patho-
logical tumor purity and clonality) can potentially help adjust the
parameter settings and improve the predictions further.

3.2 Comparative assessment using TCGA data

Next, we used genomic data from actual tumor samples for further
evaluation of our method. We first detected somatic variants in
exome-seq data for 8 unpaired tumor samples taken from the TCGA
using SomVarIUS default parameter settings, and then compared
our calls with those made using tumor-normal pairs by the TCGA

MuTect pipeline for the same samples (Cibulskis et al., 2013;
Weinstein et al., 2013) (Fig. 3A and Supplementary Table 2). The
samples had 60—70% tumor purity, and median depth of sequencing
coverage of ~200><. For a fair comparison, we only analyzed those
genomic positions that had sufficient depth of coverage for variant
calling. Unpaired sample variant calling detected 99.4% of the germ
line mutations reported by TCGA. Moreover, unpaired and paired
variant calls resulted in detection of 651 and 649 somatic mutations,
respectively, of which 441 (441/651 2 67.7%) were shared
(Fig. 3B). Of the remaining 210 potential somatic mutations re-
ported by SomVarIUS, 98 were flagged as germ line SNPs, and 112
were not detected by TCGA. We investigated them further using in-
dependent approaches.

Since experimentally validated somatic mutations were not re-
ported for these samples, for comparative evaluation we identified
somatic variants by another paired sample variant caller, VarScan2
(Koboldt et al., 2012), using exome-seq data from same 8 tumor-
normal pairs. We found 462 (462/651 2 70.9%) variants shared be-
tween VarScan2 and SomVarIUS, when genomic positions that had
sufficient depth of coverage (defaultz 10><) were analyzed.
Remaining 189 potential somatic mutations reported by
SomVarIUS, 78 were ﬂagged as germ line SNPs, and the VarScan2
did not detect 111. Out of 441 variants shared by MuTect and
SomVarIUS, VarScan identified 348 (348/441 2 75%) variants.
Interestingly, out of 112 variants that were only found
by SomVarIUS but not by MuTect, VarScan2 found 62
(62/112=55%) of them. In comparison, of the 104 variants that
were detected by MuTect only, VarScan2 detected only 34
(34/104 = 32%).

When RNAseq data from the same samples were included, we
found additional support for the somatic mutations called by our
method (Fig. 3C). Of the 112 potential somatic mutations reported
by us and not detected by the TCGA, 79 had sufficient coverage in
the RNAseq data, and of them 34 (43%) had evidence for expres-
sion of the somatic mutant allele. Importantly, the potential somatic
mutations reported by SomVarIUS and not by TCGA had signifi-
cantly higher support in the RNAseq data (34/79) compared to
those reported by TCGA and not by SomVarIUS (24/68; Fisher’s
exact test; P-value: 5 .36E — 04).

The above analyses indicate that, SomVarIUS can detect somatic
mutations using information from high coverage unpaired samples,
more than 2/3 of which are concordant with paired-sample variant
calls. Results from VarScan2 and RNAseq analyses indicate that this
might be an under-estimate, and the true proportion of somatic mu-
tations detected by SomVarIUS might be even higher.

3.3 Detection of somatic mutations in FFPE samples

A sizable proportion of the older FFPE tumor samples have no
matched control tissues available. Furthermore these samples can
have degraded DNA, which can inﬂuence sequencing and mutation
detection. We evaluated SomVarIUS variant calls for the FFPE sam-
ples, to assess if the performance was comparable to that observed
for the fresh frozen samples. We detected somatic variants in
exome-seq data for 3 FFPE tumor samples (2 colon carcinoma and 1
bladder cancer; Supplementary Table S3) taken from the TCGA
using SomVarIUS v1.1 at default parameter settings. 2339 somatic
mutations were detected (TCGA-A6-6781: 1527; TCGA-A6-3809:
623; TCGA-BL-A131: 189).

Next, we decided to compare and contrast our results with
paired-tissue somatic variant calls for the same samples. Even
though the FFPE sections of these samples were not used by the
TCGA for mutation identification, their fresh frozen sections were
sequenced and analyzed by the TCGA mutation-calling pipeline for
paired tumor-normal tissue somatic mutation detection. SomVarIUS
detected 2339 somatic variants in these samples, and of them
1167(49.9%) were identified by the TCGA paired tissue analysis as
well. Alternate alleles for ~40% of the somatic mutations reported
by both methods were also supported by paired RNAseq data. In
contrast, 32—37% of those detected by only one method were sup-
ported by RNAseq data.

The extent of overlap in somatic variant calls between the two
approaches was slightly lower compared to that observed in the previ-
ous section. There were multiple reasons for this observation. First,
we called somatic mutations from FFPE sections, but paired tissue
variant calls were available for the fresh frozen sections of the same
tumor samples. FFPE and fresh frozen sections represent different
parts of the same tumor samples, and intra-tumor genetic heterogen-
eity could potentially contribute to slightly different genetic make up
of these sections, even in the same tumor. Second, nucleic acids ex-
tracted from FFPE samples are fragmented and chemically modified,
such that DNA/RNA extraction and sequencing are challenging and
error-prone. Despite these limitations, the observed overlap in somatic
mutation calls between the two approaches highlights the utility of
our method for detecting somatic mutations in unpaired FFPE tumor
samples. Nonetheless, given these issues analysis of the FFPE samples
would probably benefit from higher sequencing coverage.

3.4 Treatment associated clonal dynamics in leukemia

We performed targeted deep sequencing of pre- and post-treatment
clinical samples from 5 acute myeloid leukemia patients undergoing
an experimental therapy using a gene panel covering 33 frequently
mutated cancer genes. Paired normal samples were not available for
these cases. Tumor purity was measured by the percent bone mar-
row aspirate blast count in the pre- and post-treatment samples.
Average depth of sequencing in samples analyzed was ~5000><. We
identified potential somatic mutations in several leukemia-associ-
ated cancer genes using SomVarIUS, and investigated their change
in allele frequencies between pre- and post-treatment conditions
(Fig. 4). The allelic abundance of ATM mutations in patient 1 and
5 and RUNX1 mutations in patient 2 and 3 increased in post-

treatment samples (25 % change in allelic abundance). These
changes were unlikely due to difference in percent blast count
(Supplementary Table S4). Our analysis indicates that mutations in
ATM and RUNX1 were present in the pre-treatment stages, albeit
at lower allele frequencies, and that perhaps treatment induced clo-
nal competition and selection lead to preferential expansion of
clones carrying these mutations. The patterns of clonal evolution
observed here are similar to that reported elsewhere (Ding et al.,
2012), and indicate that subclonal cancer gene mutations present
additional challenges for precision medicine in oncology initiatives.

4 Discussions

SomVarIUS can be useful in a variety of clinical or research settings,
where matched normal samples are not yet routinely collected (e.g.
precision medicine initiatives) or for archival samples (e.g. FFPE and
fresh frozen tumor samples stored in the tissue banks). Filtering of
common, germ line SNPs can help minimize accidental release of
genetic information (e.g. haplotype blocks), which could be used to
trace patient identity, while still enabling data sharing within the
cancer research community.

SomVarIUS is fast, and provides an option to run the framework
using user-defined parameter settings, which adds to its versatility.
It analyzed sorted and indexed bam files for 8 TCGA samples in 2 h
time on a 3.2 GHz, 16 Gb RAM quad core machine. It also has a
limited number of dependencies, and open-source architecture,
which can be of added benefit. It is easy to integrate it into any
standard genome analysis pipeline. For instance, it might be possible
to prioritize high confidence variants using alternative variant call-
ers, and use it to identify those of potential somatic origin.
SomVarIUS takes advantage of availability of additional high
throughput sequencing data (e.g. RNAseq, exome-seq, targeted
sequencing) data from the same samples (which are sometimes avail-
able in clinical settings) to provide additional evidence for the candi-
date mutations. It also provides additional annotation for clinically
relevant variants (e.g. drug resistant mutations).

We note that, SomVarIUS is not designed to identify somatic mu-
tations that reach allelic frequency higher than the ploidy-adjusted
heterozygous germ line SNPs (e.g. homozygous mutations with al-
lelic abundance >05 in diploid regions). Furthermore, it may not be
able to optimally distinguish somatic mutations from germ line vari-
ants and/or sequencing errors in low coverage sequencing data.
However these limitations are inherent to low coverage unpaired
samples, and may not be a major concern for clinical samples that
are typically sequenced at high depth. Ongoing projects such as
UK10K study, when completed, will also be able to provide an even

Fig. 4. Clonal dynamics of cancer gene mutations in five AML patients de-
tected using targeted deep sequencing are shown. Only those mutations that
have 25% allele frequency change between pre- and post-treatment condi-
tion are reported. For patient 4, we did not found any somatic mutations that
have 25% allele frequency change between the pre- and post-treatment
stages

denser catalog of SNPs, which will be helpful. Nevertheless, we rec-
ommend using samples with sufficient sequencing coverage (e.g.
2100><) for somatic mutation detection from unpaired samples with
SomVarIUS. We will also improve the clonality assessment using
copy number information, similar to that implemented elsewhere
(Miller et al., 2014; Qiao et al., 2014; Roth et al., 2014). Finally,
SomVarIUS is not intended to replace the paired-sample variant call-
ing tools; rather it provides a useful utility for identifying potential
somatic mutations when paired tissues are not available.

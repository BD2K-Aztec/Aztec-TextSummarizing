ABSTRACT

Summary: Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) are attracting much at-
tention as a means of overcoming the inherently poor cellular uptake
of various bioactive molecules. Here, we introduce CPPpred, a web
server for the prediction of CPPs using a N-to-‘I neural network. The
server takes one or more peptide sequences, between 5 and 30 amino
acids in length, as input and returns a prediction of how likely each
peptide is to be cell penetrating. CPPpred was developed with redun-
dancy reduced training and test sets, offering an advantage over the
only other currently available CPP prediction method.

Availability and Implementation: CPPpred is freely available to non-
commercial users at http://bioware.ucd.ie/cpppred.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell penetrating peptides (CPPs) demonstrate the ability to pass
through cellular membranes. Accordingly, CPPs are emerging as
potential tools for aiding the transport of therapeutic molecules
that are not inherently bioavailable, and moreover as possible
bioactive agents in their own right (Johansson et al., 2007).
Although a number of broad classiﬁcation systems for CPPs
have been proposed (Heitz et al., 2009; Madani et al., 2011,
Milletti, 2012), in general, CPPs are typiﬁed by a length of
5—30 amino acids, an enrichment in basic residues, therefore a
net positive charge, and are hydrophobic in part (Lundberg and
Langel, 2003). Several in silico CPP prediction algorithms have
been developed to facilitate high-throughput screening of pep-
tides. Initially, methods focused on the use of scales of chemical
properties, known as z—descriptors (Sandberg et al., 1998), for the
prediction of CPPs (Héillbrink et al., 2005). Other approaches
applied to CPP prediction include quantitative structure—activity
relationship models (Dobchev et al., 2010) and support vector
machines (Gautam et al., 2013; Sanders et al., 2011), although
only one of these methods, CellPPD (Gautam et al., 2013), is
publicly available. Here, we present CPPpred, a CPP prediction
method that uses a neural network (NN) approach. Although
others have previously applied NN techniques to the prediction

of CPPs (Dobchev et al., 2010), CPPpred represents the only
publicly available NN—based method.

2 METHODS
2.1 Training and Test Datasets

We generated our training dataset using 111 CPPs and 34 experimentally
validated non-CPPs from Sanders et al. (2011). We selected peptides 5—30
amino acids in length and internally redundancy reduced these sets inde-
pendently to <80% sequence similarity using BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1997), leaving 74 CPPs and 30 non-CPPS. We supplemented the negative
set with 70 peptides randomly selected from a 30% internally redundancy
reduced set of 1445 bioactive peptides of 5—30 amino acids in length
retrieved from BIOPEP (Dziuba et al., 1999), PeptideDB (Liu et al.,
2008), CAMP (Thomas et al., 2010) and APD2 (Wang et al., 2009).
Only peptides that did not have the same sequence as a CPP in our
training set and were not a subsequence of a CPP, or vice versa, were
retained (Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Independent Test Datasets

In all, 843 CPPs were retrieved from CPPsite (Gautam et al., 2012). From
this set we selected peptides of 5—30 amino acids in length, labeled as
having either ‘Greater’, ‘High’ or ‘Higher’ uptake efﬁciency (according to
the classiﬁcation of CPPsite) and redundancy reduced this set with respect
to our training set to <80% sequence similarity. This left only 47 CPPs
from the larger dataset, which we matched with 47 randomly selected
bioactive peptides, as described previously, to create our negative set
(Supplementary Table S1).

2.3 Predictive Architecture

N-to-l neural networks, or Nl-NNS, have been successfully used to pre-
dict the subcellular location of protein sequences (Mooney et al., 2011)
and bioactive peptides (Mooney et al., 2012). Here, we apply this model
to the prediction of CPPs. The aim of the model is to map a peptide
sequence of variable length N into a single property i.e. CPP or non-CPP.
Other models tackle this problem at the source, i.e. they transform/
compress the sequence into a ﬁxed number of descriptors (or into de-
scriptors of pairwise relations between sequences) beforehand, and then
map these descriptors into the property of interest. These descriptors are
typically frequencies of residues or k-mers, sometimes computed separ-
ately on different parts of the sequence (Gautam et al., 2012; Sanders
et al., 2011). In Nl-NNS we do not compress the peptide in advance;
instead, we decide beforehand only how many features we want to com-
press a peptide into.

Nl-NNs are particularly suited to the problem of CPP prediction, as
they do not rely on frequency counts, but look at whole motifs, and do so
using a small number of free parameters. Therefore, they have an

advantage over frequency-based methods, in that they incorporate infor-
mation about relative positions of amino acids in a sequence, whilst also
minimizing the risk of overﬁtting. All possible overlapping motifs in a
sequence are processed by the same basic unit, using the same parameters.
For this reason, they are advantageous over algorithms that look at a
ﬁxed input window, as they overcome the problem of choosing an arbi-
trary reference frame for peptides of different sizes. They also have a
potential advantage over methods that do not rely on ﬁxed windows
(e.g. support vector machines (SVM) based on spectral or alignment
kernels), in that Nl-NNs learn a transform of the sequence that is in-
formative to predict the target property, rather than relying on any pre-
deﬁned transform or set thereof. If training is successful, the feature
vector will retain what is useful in the input and discard what is not.
This is subtly different from compressing the sequence into some code
ﬁrst (potentially erasing useful information) and then optimizing the map
between the code and the target.

2.4 Training and Ensembling

Each training was conducted in 5-fold cross-validation, i.e. ﬁve different
sets of training runs were performed in which a different ﬁfth of the
overall set was reserved for testing and another ﬁfth was reserved for
validating. During training the networks that performed best on the val-
idation set were saved; these models were then averaged over the ensem-
ble and evaluated on the corresponding test set. The ﬁnal result for the
5-fold cross-validation is the average of the results on each test set. When
testing on the independent test set, we ensemble-combined all the models
from all cross-validation folds of the best architecture.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The only other publicly available CPP predictor that we are
aware of is CellPPD (Gautam et al., 2013). Owing to the short
nature of CPPs and the impact that single residue changes can
have on the efﬁciency of penetration, or non-penetration, the
authors did not internally redundancy reduce their training set,
or redundancy reduce their independent test sets with respect to
their training set. We were concerned that this could have po-
tentially led to overﬁtting of their models. Because the datasets of
penetrating peptides are relatively dominated by cationic and
amphiphilic peptides, we considered that the redundancy reduc-
tion to avoid overﬁtting would eliminate most of the data.
However, we were pleased to note that training was still possible
even after 80% redundancy reduction (i.e. no more than 80%
identity between any two sequences) (see Table 1). The predictive
power of CPPpred is demonstrated in Figure 1. We note that the
performance is good on both the redundancy reduced training
set (Fig. 1a) and independent test set (Fig. 1b), which was redun-
dancy reduced with respect to the training set, indicating that our
method is not showing very obvious signs of extensive overﬁt-
ting, despite the relatively small training set of 74 CPPs.

More extensive redundancy reduction in the training set would
be likely to reduce the ability to train a useful predictor
(Supplementary Material). However, it is worth noting that
after 30% redundancy reduction of the test set, CPPpred cor-
rectly predicted 17 of the 29 CPPs and 27 of the 29 non-CPPs
(Q = 75.86 %).

3.1 Implementation

each of these peptides will be cell penetrating. When the user is
interpreting the results, it is important to note that the server
predicts how likely the peptide is to be cell penetrating, and
does not predict the degree of uptake efﬁciency. CPPpred was
trained at a threshold of 0.5, i.e. any peptide predicted over a 0.5
threshold is labeled as cell penetrating. Roughly, one-ﬁfth of
peptides above 0.5 are false positives, whereas less than a tenth
of peptides above 0.7 are false positives (Fig. 1a). However, the
user may decide to choose a higher threshold to reduce the false-
positive rate. Training and testing was performed using amino
acid sequences without any modiﬁcations. After using CPPpred
to discover CPPs in silico, various peptide modiﬁcations may be
experimented with in vitro to increase the uptake efﬁciency of the
peptide.

3.2 CPPpred—a worked example

CPPpred provides researchers interested in bioactive peptides
and nutraceuticals with an important resource for evaluating
the cell penetrating potential of candidate peptides of interest.
To demonstrate the application of CPPpred to empirical data,
we selected a known bioactive peptide, lactoferricin B, from
bovine milk for analysis. Lactoferricin B, consisting of 25
amino acids, exhibits antimicrobial activity (Bellamy et al.,
1993) and has been shown experimentally to be cell penetrating
(Haukland et al., 2001). Importantly, this peptide (or any asso-
ciated subsets) is not found in either our training or test sets.
When CPPpred is applied to lactoferricin B, a prediction score of
0.725 is achieved, demonstrating the predictive power of
CPPpred.

Further to this, an 11 amino acid subsequence of lactoferricin
B, also with known antimicrobial activity (Strom et al., 2002),
attains a CPPpred score of 0.815. Although the cell penetrating
capabilities of this undecapeptide have not yet been validated
experimentally, it is widely appreciated that cell penetration is
a feature of antimicrobial peptides (Splith and Neundorf, 2011).
We feel that this example highlights the potential utility of
CPPpred in assisting researchers in the selection of peptides for
chemical synthesis to experimentally verify their cell penetrating
potential.

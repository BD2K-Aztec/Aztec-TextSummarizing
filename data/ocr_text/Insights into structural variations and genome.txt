ABSTRACT

Structural variations (SVs) are genomic rearrangements that affect
fairly large fragments of DNA. Most of the SVs such as inversions,
deletions and translocations have been largely studied in context of
genetic diseases in eukaryotes. However, recent studies demonstrate
that genome rearrangements can also have profound impact on pro-
karyotic genomes, leading to altered cell phenotype. In contrast to
single-nucleotide variations, SVs provide a much deeper insight into
organization of bacterial genomes at a much better resolution. SVs
can confer change in gene copy number, creation of new genes,
altered gene expression and many other functional consequences.
High-throughput technologies have now made it possible to explore
SVs at a much refined resolution in bacterial genomes. Through this
review, we aim to highlight the importance of the less explored field of
SVs in prokaryotic genomes and their impact. We also discuss its
potential applicability in the emerging fields of synthetic biology and
genome engineering where targeted SVs could serve to create sophis-
ticated and accurate genome editing.

1 INTRODUCTION

The sequencing of a large number of prokaryotic genomes and
sequence comparison of closely related species have unraveled a
large repertoire of genomic variations (Skovgaard et al., 2011;
Srivatsan et al., 2008). A large number of studies focusing on
variations in prokaryotic genomes have been majorly concen-
trated on single-nucleotide variations and small insertion—dele-
tion events (Sun et al., 2012). It is now being increasingly
recognized that in addition to single-nucleotide variations,
other types of variations that include large genomic rearrange-
ments are not infrequent in bacterial genomes (Darling et al.,
2008; Sun et al., 2012). Among the different types of genetic
variations found in genomes, structural variants have remained
the most difficult to identify and interpret. Structural variations
(SVs) encompass a fairly large piece of DNA and can emerge as a
result of different cellular mechanisms such as DNA recombin-
ation, replication and DNA repair (Hastings et al., 2009b). SVs

introduce variability in gene copy number, position, orientation
and, in several cases, combinations of these events (Freeman
et al., 2006). The mechanisms of SV formation appears to be
similar in prokaryotes and eukaryotes (Hastings et al., 2009a,
b). But, SVs have not been widely explored and studied in pro-
karyotic genomes as compared with eukaryotes (Kresse et al.,
2003; Liang et al., 2010; Skovgaard et al., 2011).

The comprehensive assessment of SVs has been a challenge
largely due to the underlying complex mechanisms that gives
rise to them. Accurate and precise identification of SVs would
require prediction of three features, namely, copy, content and
structure (Alkan et al., 2011). Over the years, several approaches
have been developed to detect and characterize SVs. Some of the
classical methods include ArrayCGH (array comparative gen-
omic hybridization) and single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
arrays, which have been extensively reviewed earlier (Alkan
et al., 2011; Carter, 2007). ArrayCGH is based on hybridizing
ﬂuorescently labeled sample with normal DNA immobilized on a
glass surface and analyzing hybridization ratios. SNP arrays on
the other hand use single sample per array and measure the
intensities of the probe signals on the basis of single base
difference.

The major understanding on the genomic landscape of SVs
was facilitated by the availability of sequencing technologies
coupled with computational algorithms to map and identify
SVs at a much higher resolution (Skovgaard et al., 2011; Sun
et al., 2012). In sequencing-based approaches, paired-end reads
generated with an approximate insert size are mapped onto the
reference genome. The pairs mapping at a distance substantially
different from expected length or in altered orientation are nomi-
nated as structural variants. SVs identiﬁed by means of sequen-
cing data offer a strong advantage of detecting ‘breakpoints’ (i.e.
sequence boundaries where an SV begins and ends) (Jiang et al.,
2012; Sindi et al., 2009; Ye et al., 2009), which can further aid to
unravel the functional impact of a variant and the mechanisms
that created it (Bao et al., 2014). Though the high-throughput
technologies have significantly contributed to the understanding
of the repertoire of SVs in prokaryotic genomes, the problem of
SV detection has always remained challenging as none of the
methods can appropriately address the complexity of repetitive
regions found in genomes.

It is widely believed that the SVs arise as a by-product of
illegitimate recombination events (homologous recombination)
and also by imprecise non-homologous repair mechanism

during aberrant DNA replication to repair broken replication
forks (Hastings et al., 2009a, b). Apart from being the focus of
evolutionary analysis (Lim et al., 2012), the phenotypic implica-
tions of SVs in bacterial genomes have also been deciphered (Cui
et al., 2012; Dobinsky et al., 2002; Nagarajan et al., 2012), which
are discussed in detail in the later part of the manuscript.

In this review, we provide a comprehensive overview of the
present understanding of SVs in general and in the context of
prokaryotic genomes. We brieﬂy describe the various types of
SVs, discuss their probable molecular mechanisms of formation,
advances in the development of tools and techniques to detect
SVs and also their phenotypic consequences in context of pro-
karyotic genomes. We also discuss currently used methodologies
of next-generation sequencing (NGS) and analysis algorithms,
which could provide a comprehensive and high-resolution map
of SVs and how they could be extensively used for understanding
biological phenomena of strain variability and evolution. We
also describe their potential applications in the emerging fields
of synthetic biology and genome engineering.

2 GENERAL OVERVIEW OF SVS

SVs involve long stretches of DNA that can span from a few
kilobases to sometimes up to millions of base pairs in length.
Chromosomal rearrangements can result in loss, amplification
(Andersson et al., 1998), translocation (Block et al., 2012) and
inversions (Johnson, 1991) of DNA fragments. SVs can contrib-
ute to evolution of an organism through disruption of an existing
gene (Jasin and Schimmel, 1984), creation of a new gene
(Nagarajan et al., 2012) or a chimeric gene product through
gene fusions (Nogami et al., 1985; Roth et al., 1996). In bacterial
genomes, chromosomal rearrangements can change the distance
of a gene from the origin of chromosome replication (oriC) lead-
ing to altered gene copy number and thereby affecting its expres-
sion (Rebollo et al., 1988).

SVs can be broadly classified into five major classes—
Deletions, Duplications, Insertions, Inversions and
Translocations. Each of these discrete events is caused by a
double-strand break involving at least two different locations,
followed by a re—ligation of the broken ends to produce a new
chromosomal arrangement or context at the ends (Hastings
et al., 2009a, b; Roth et al., 1996). The rearrangements could
widely vary in their lengths, ranging from a few thousand nu-
cleotides to a few million nucleotides. In some cases, the re-
arrangement could encompass genes, even operons or a large
number of genes depending on the size of the rearranged frag-
ment (Hastings et al., 2009b). The different types of SVs and
their genomic contexts are summarized in Supplementary
Figure S1. The functional consequences of the SVs could there-
fore vary widely.

The unbalanced SVs having a net gain or loss of genetic ma-
terial include deletions, duplications and insertions (Bentley and
Parkhill, 2004). Deletions entail loss of a genomic segment, and
could be intragenic, wherein they result in inactivation of a gene
or the loss of one or more functional domains or an altered gene
function. In case of intergenic deletions, they could potentially
affect the regulatory regions, thereby affecting the expression of
neighboring genes (Angov and Brusilow, 1994). Duplications are
marked by the presence of two or more copies of a genomic

region or a genomic segment (Anderson and Roth, 1977).
The duplicated regions may either lie adjacent to each other,
referred to as tandem duplication (\Nang et al., 1982) or could
occur at a different genomic location termed as insertional du-
plication. Duplication generally results in gain of a copy of the
DNA segment carrying information (Roth et al., 1996). The
functional consequence of the duplication could vary depending
on the information content of the duplicated genomic segment
and also on the context in which it is inserted (Reams and Neidle,
2004). The third class of unbalanced SVs is the insertions.
Insertion involves gain of a genomic segment through a
double-stranded break (DSB). The well-studied example of in-
sertions is the Horizontal Gene Transfer (HGT) (Nelson et al.,
1999; Ochman et al., 2000). HGT results in the gain of a new
genomic segment in a new genomic context. In addition to novel
sequence insertion, mobile-element insertion can also lead to SVs
(Xing et al., 2009). Mobile elements jump from one position to
another within a genome often resulting in duplication. The func-
tional consequences of insertions are governed by the informa-
tion content of the inserted fragment and the context of the
genomic segment of insertion (Dobinsky et al., 2002).

The balanced SVs comprise inversions. Inversions are vari-
ations that involve a rearrangement of the orientation of a gen-
omic segment (Johnson, 1991). These are copy-invariant SVs
because there is no net gain or loss of genomic information.
Typically, inversions involve two breakpoints and realignment
of the ﬂipped ends. The functional consequences of inversions
are potentially guided by their new genomic contexts (Johnson,
1991).

SVs could also involve exchange of a genomic segment from
one context to another within the same chromosome or between
chromosomes and are classified as translocations. Translocations
can be either balanced with the retention of full genetic function-
ality or unbalanced with loss or gain of functional elements
(Block et al., 2012). This type of SV is particularly more evident
and common in multi-chromosomal bacteria, where the smaller
secondary chromosomes evolve more rapidly (Morrow and
Cooper, 2012).

3 MOLECULAR PREDISPOSITION AND
MECHANISM OF STRUCTURAL VARIABILITY IN
PROKARYOTIC GENOMES

Apart from the above well-defined classes of SVs, complex SVs
that include combinations of two or more of these broad classes
are not uncommon to observe in real-life situations (Hastings
et al., 2009b). A number of studies have highlighted the molecu-
lar predispositions that enable SVs to occur. This includes a wide
variety of chromosomal contexts such as sequence and structural
motifs, repeat elements, insertion sequence (IS) elements and
transposon elements (TE) (Mahillon and Chandler, 1998;
Treangen et al., 2009). In organisms with repetitive DNA, hom-
ologous repetitive segments within one chromosome or on
different chromosomes can serve as sites for illegitimate cross-
ing-over. Bacterial DNA consists of an extensive array of repeti-
tive sequences, which significantly underlie genomic instability
and contain recombination hotspots (Aras et al., 2003;
Treangen et al., 2009). DNA repeats increases the chances of

Structural variations in prokaryotic genomes

 

rearrangement through recombination, amplification and dele-
tion of genetic material, thereby leading to genome plasticity
(Aras et al., 2003; Bao et al., 2014). Generic repeats may arise
by HGT whereby the incoming DNA fragment contains the in-
formation already present in the host genome and integrates
seamlessly into the host genome using site-specific recombination
(Treangen et al., 2009).

There have been some important functional consequences of
repetitive elements in chromosome rearrangements. Naas et al.
(1995) suggested that in resting Escherichia c0li strain, the spon-
taneous mutagenesis is IS-specific and the observed genetic poly-
morphism is a consequence of DNA rearrangements. The effects
of deletions are highly irreversible and can be explained by the
loss of functions. The effects of large inversions on the other
hand result from selection for chromosome organization
(Rocha, 2008). The Neisseria species contains an extensive
array of repetitive sequences such as tandem repeats and IS elem-
ents spread throughout its genome. Comparative genome ana-
lysis of Neisseria meningitidis revealed that repeats are involved
in three major inversion events (Bentley et al., 2007).
Additionally, the bacterial species Neisseria gonorrhoeae, which
contains fewer repeat elements than N .meningitidis, also showed
that rearrangements are associated with IS elements leading to
inversion (Spencer-Smith et al., 2012). In addition to the se-
quence elements, other structural elements including Z-DNA
(Freund et al., 1989) and G—quadruplex motifs have been impli-
cated in predisposing specific genomic loci to recombination
(Katapadi et al., 2012).

4 PHENOTYPIC IMPACT OF SV AND
CHROMOSOMAL REARRANGEMENTS

Genome rearrangements in prokaryotes have also been studied
in relation to their phenotypic outcomes. Recent studies suggest
that the genomic rearrangements and SVs have a profound
impact on the phenotypic outcomes in a number of organisms
(Cui et al., 2012; Gaudriault et al., 2008; Okinaka et al., 2011).
Both balanced and unbalanced forms of variation have remained
difficult to interpret with respect to their functional consequence.
Though many variant calling technologies have enabled the iden-
tification and characterization of SVs (Skovgaard et al., 2011;
Sun et al., 2012), the large size of the SVs and the complexities of
their rearrangements have posed challenges in deciphering their
functional consequences. In addition, the molecular, cellular and
mechanistic insights into their formation and resultant pheno-
type remain largely obscure (VVeischenfeldt et al., 2013). Some
important studies emphasizing the functional impact of SVs in
prokaryotic genomes have been established (Darling et al., 2008).
Large-scale rearrangements in closely related strains of a species,
for example, in the case of Yersinia pestis, have shown to signifi-
cantly contribute to the evolution, divergence and pathogenicity
of the organism (Liang et al., 2010).

Deletions and duplications can potentially lead to altered
doses of otherwise functionally intact elements. Phenotypic ef-
fects of deletions depend on the size and the location of deleted
chromosomal segments on the genome. Larger deletions are
likely to involve many genes, thereby resulting in more drastically
altered phenotypes (Srivatsan et al., 2008). Deletions

encompassing loss of essential genes or gene components may
significantly hamper cell Viability (J asin and Schimmel, 1984). On
the other hand, gene duplication can have four possible out-
comes (Treangen et al., 2009): (i) non-functionalization or loss
of the duplicated gene through deletion or degeneration; (ii) sub-
functionalization, resulting in adoption of complementary roles;
(iii) neo-functionalization, resulting in new functions (Blount
et al., 2012); and (iV) differential regulation of duplicated genes
allowing spatiotemporal expression. The last possibility has been
explored by Nagarajan et al. where they show that both the
operons of duplicated hik3l are temporally and differentially
regulated and share an integrated regulatory relationship
(Nagarajan et al., 2012).

Gene deletions could also arise from recombination events
involving repeats (Gaudriault et al., 2008). It has been proposed
that these deletions arise because these genes are particularly rich
in closely spaced repeats (Achaz et al., 2002), for example, the
deletion of 54 nt between two 8nt length direct repeats in the
mismatch repair gene, mutS of Pseudomonas aeruginosa show
close association of the deletion with the repeats at the edges
(Oliver et al., 2002). In another study, experimental deletion of
the mutS gene of E.c0li showed that the truncated protein intro-
duces variability in DNA binding, dimerization and its inter-
actions with mutL (Wu and Marinus, 1999).

Large chromosomal inversions were initially considered to be
rare in bacteria (Roth et al., 1996), but recent studies show these
to be among the major forces responsible for genome evolution
(Hughes, 2000). The two closely related species Salmonella typhi—
murium and E.c0li displayed contrasting behavior in terms of
permissibility of inversions. Though in E.c0li, it was earlier
shown that inversions could lead to Viable cells with reduced
cell growth (Hill and Harnish, 1981) but later it was also demon-
strated that the inversions introduced in the non-permissive re-
gions of the chromosome were refractory in nature meaning that
they are mechanistically feasible but lethal (Guijo et al., 2001;
Rebollo et al., 1988). However, in S.typhimurium no such region
was identified and the failure to introduce inversions was sug-
gested to be a mechanistic problem (Miesel et al., 1994; Segall
et al., 1988). In yet another supporting evidence, Campo et al.
(2004) characterized the two constrained chromosomal regions in
gram-positive bacteria (the oriC and ter domain) where they
showed that introduction of inversions is mechanistically pos-
sible but leads to reduced cell fitness and lethal cell phenotype.

Acquisition of mobile genetic elements through HGT in
Staphylococcus aureus contributes to its genotypic and pheno-
typic diversity (Deurenberg et al., 2007; Diep et al., 2006).
Clones of Saareus are thought to evolve by point mutations
instead of genetic recombination, which are considered as rare
in this species (Feil et al., 2003). Introduction of mobile genetic
elements by site-specific recombinases can bestow epidemiolo-
gical advantage to the pathogen with traits such as survival
under low pH conditions, and stressed environments, or drug-
resistant strains (Deurenberg et al., 2007; Diep et al., 2006).
Genomic rearrangements can confer drug resistance and aid in
pathogen evolution such as the evolution of pandemic strains in
Y.pestis as a result of accumulation of rearrangements (Liang
et al., 2010). Alteration in the gene pool of a genome is central
to adaptive evolution. Reconstructing the genome synteny evo-
lution can contribute to understanding of the dynamics of

genome evolution. Genome rearrangements can lead to gain or
loss of genes and can help to understand the long- and short-
term genome evolution (Furuta et al., 2011). Although evolution-
ary implications of SVs have been shown at large, few studies
have highlighted their functional and biological importance. For
instance, the reversible switching on—off of colony variation in
Saareus suggest a survival strategy for coping with uncertain
and variable environments (Cui et al., 2012). Some key examples
highlighting phenotypic changes associated with SVs in bacterial
genomes are presented in Supplementary Table S1.

Apart from creating SVs in the genome, TEs and IS elements
can also inﬂuence the expression of the genes, depending on the
context of the gene in relation to the element. TEs can affect the
expression of closely placed and nearby genes by either interrupt-
ing them or enhancing their expression (Brown and Evans, 1991).
SVs involving IS elements have been shown to activate the ex-
pression of neighboring genes (Hubner and Hendrickson, 1997;
Mahillon and Chandler, 1998). A conceptual overview of the
potential functional effects of SVs is summarized in Figure 1.

5 SYMMETRY OF GENOME REARRANGEMENTS

Large rearrangements have been shown to be highly deleterious
in prokaryotic genomes (Rocha, 2008). The symmetrical organ-
ization of bacterial chromosome along the replichores (Eisen
et al., 2000) leads to biased symmetrical genome rearrangements.
Three selection forces have been hypothesized by Mackiewicz
et al. (2001) for the biased symmetrical genome rearrangements.
Firstly, the distance of a gene from oriC has been shown to be a
major selection force. This arises from the fact that the copy
number of transcripts is significantly variable and dependent
on the distance of the gene from the oriC, and a strong positional
bias for genes with specific functional attributes have been
observed. The selection pressure leads to optimally placed
genes with respect to oriC for genes with certain functional at-
tributes. Second, difference in replication associated mutational
pressure in leading and lagging strands (Mackiewicz et al., 2001).
Symmetrical inversion of genes encompassing the oriC does not
change gene location with respect to the leading and lagging
DNA strands (Eisen et al., 2000). Thirdly, the constraint of keep-
ing both replichores of same size leads to symmetrical inversions
at oriC and ter. Large inversions, which disturb the symmetry
around the constrained chromosomal regions, i.e. the oriC and
ter domains, have been suggested to result in reduced cell fitness
(Campo et al., 2004). Symmetrical inter-replichore inversions are
more frequently observed than any other rearrangement.
Chromosome breakpoint analysis in naturally evolving popula-
tion of Yersinia showed that the rate of inversion is three times
higher near oriC, thereby, displaying recombination bias and
selective forces reducing the inversion rate near ter (Darling
et al., 2008).

6 METHODS FOR DETECTING SVS

6.1 Classical approaches

Technological advancements for detecting genomic SVs have
facilitated our ability to investigate details of genome structure,
patterns and extent of genome organization in various organisms

(Quail et al., 2012; Sun et al., 2012). The classical approaches
used to detect SVs include conventional cytogenetic methods of
‘chromosome banding’, which is staining of condensed chromo-
somes for precise identification of individual chromosomes or
parts of chromosomes, and ‘karyotyping’, which is the process
of pairing and ordering all the chromosomes of an organism.
These methods were limited by their low throughput and low
resolution (Alkan et al., 2011). High-density genotyping micro-
arrays involved hybridization of nucleic acid sample to a large set
of probes to detect variations in genes. Although they were high
on throughput, they were limited by detecting only small copy-
number variants (Iafrate et al., 2004). The resolution and scal-
ability of SV detection was improved with use of an ‘optical
mapping’ technique, which was based on restriction mapping
and allowed identification of ﬁne-scale structural analysis of gen-
omes but on other hand was limited by its dependency on a
reference genome (Teague et al., 2010). Other techniques include
‘DNA barcoding’, which uses a short genetic marker in an

Structural variations in prokaryotic genomes

 

organism’s DNA to identify species. It allows detection of
balanced rearrangements by making use of ﬂuorescently labeled
nano-channel ﬂow cells (Das et al., 2010). The ‘emulsion droplet
PCR’ method generates water-in-oil emulsion droplets contain-
ing all polymerase chain reaction components and has been used
for estimating absolute copy number (Beer et al., 2007). The
major impetus toward understanding genomic SVs sprang
from the availability of whole-genome sequences of multiple pro-
karyotic species and, in many cases, multiple closely related
strains of a given species (Tatusova et al., 2014).

6.2 Detecting rearrangements by whole genome
comparisons

A large number of tools and methods offer information on re-
arrangements by pairwise comparative analysis of sequences.
‘GeneOrder3.0’ developed by Celamkoti et al. (2004) allows the
rapid identiﬁcation and Visualization of gene order and synteny
between two bacterial genomes under comparison without any a
priori knowledge or information of their phylogenetic related-
ness. It has been tested on the smallest bacterial genomes:
Mycoplasma, Haemophilus and few other bacteria of size <2
MB. It is an enhanced version of previous algorithms
GeneOrder (Mazumder et al., 2001).

Structural changes in genome are common occurrences during
evolution of prokaryotic species. The earlier methodologies for
annotating SVs in prokaryotic genomes have been majorly
focused on pairwise comparison of genomes. In 2004, Darling
et al introduced a multiple genome comparison and Visualization
method called Mauve, which identiﬁes rearrangements and in-
versions in conserved regions, small in-dels and the exact se-
quence breakpoints. When used to align nine enterobacterial
genomes it was able to resurrect most of the known inversions
(Darling et al., 2004). Comparing rearrangements in multi-
chromosome genomes proved to be a more daunting task. In
2006, Lu et al proposed a novel algorithm called ‘FFBI’
(Fusion, ﬁssion and block interchanges), to compare circular
multi-chromosome genomes such as the Vibrio and
Burkhola’eria pathogens (Lu et al., 2006). The FFBI algorithm
was designed to analyze genome rearrangements arising as a
result of chromosome fusion, ﬁssion and blocks interchanges.
Genome rearrangements detected in the three Vibrio genomes
were coherent with earlier studies.

In 2011, a highly computationally efﬁcient whole genome
alignment tool called Mugsy was introduced, which detected du-
plications, rearrangements and large gain/loss in genomes
(Angiuoli and Salzberg, 2011). Mugsy’s performance was evalu-
ated on 57 E.c0li and 31 Streptococcus pneumoniae genomes. It
works without reference genomes.

Recently, Marttinen et al. (2012) developed a statistical algo-
rithm called ‘BratNextGen’ that allows large-scale comparison of
recombination events in hundreds of complete bacterial gen-
omes. They compared 241 whole genomes of S.pneum0niae to
detect ~39k polymorphic sites over the 2 MB genome aligned.
BratNextGen functions by creating a Bayesian clustering model,
to detect recombination in taxa along with resampling.

Large chromosomal rearrangements studies done using trad-
itional genetic mapping or whole genome comparisons have been
challenging in terms of accuracy and throughput. The

availability of a gamut of new technologies for high-throughput
nucleotide sequencing have opened up new opportunities toward
understanding genome structure and their variations.

6.3 Detecting SVS using NGS

Whole genome sequencing (WGS) by means of NGS platforms
has been used to detect mutations (Srivatsan et al., 2008).
Though tools for mapping of paired-end information for SV
calling are plenty, however, each may have their own limitations,
advantages and overheads of usage. Additionally, most of them
have been tested on eukaryotic (speciﬁcally humans) genomes
and require additional conﬁrmation so as to conﬁdently rely
on their output (Chen et al., 2009; Hormozdiari et al., 2009;
Korbel et al., 2009; Zeitouni et al., 2010). Nevertheless, as the
mechanism of SV formation in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes
appears similar (Hastings et al., 2009a, b), the tools and algo-
rithms could essentially be applied to study SVs in prokaryotes
as well. Data from short-read sequencing generally lead to in-
complete genome assemblies because of the intractable complex-
ities such as long repetitive regions found in genomes
(Huddleston et al., 2014). However, with the availability of
long reads sequencing technologies with read lengths sometimes
extending to tens of kilobases from single molecule sequencing
approaches (Quail et al., 2012) to generate ﬁnished microbial
genomes (Chin et al., 2013), provides a new opportunity toward
identifying SVs and genome dynamics at a higher resolution.

A plethora of analytical algorithms and techniques have been
developed over the years to precisely detect SV boundaries
(Fig. 2) with increased resolution ranging from few mega base
pairs to kilo base pairs and recently to even at the single nucleo-
tide resolution (Chen et al., 2009; MedvedeV et al., 2009; Zeitouni
et al., 2010). A comprehensive list of sequence signatures that can

techniques with their potential applications and limitations.

Fig. 2. Some of the commonly used analytical ways of detecting SVs.
Paired-end reads, Read depth and Split reads could be used to call SVs.
Read depth refers to the number of reads mapping onto a particular part
of the genome. In Split reads, a single read maps to two different parts of
the genome that lie far away from each other

Table l and a comprehensive list of same is provided in Table S2.
In this section, we would discuss some of the algorithms de-
veloped in the past 5 years. The algorithm PEMer (Paired-End
Mapper) could process data from several NGS platforms and
mapped SVs at a high resolution (Korbel et al., 2009). PEMer
maps SVs at a higher resolution with a conﬁdence measure and
allows storage, display and manipulation of SV data. PEMer can
detect insertion, deletion and inversions. Despite a few limita-
tions of PEMer such as its inability to detect breakpoints in
repetitive regions, SNP-based misalignment errors and missing
out large insertions, it appears to be a useful method for calling
variants.

Next-generation VariationHunter introduced in 2010
(Hormozdiari et al., 2010) was an improved version of previ-
ously published combinatorial algorithm VariationHunter
(Hormozdiari et al., 2009). It makes use of maximum parsimony
algorithm to map paired-end reads obtained from NGS.
Compared with its earlier release, the new algorithm could re-
solve incompatible SV calls and requires no post-processing of
results. Besides insertions, inversions and deletion events, it also
has the capability to detect mobile element insertions. It has
better accuracy than MoDIL, which can detect 20—50 bp in-
dels (Lee et al., 2009) and BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009).

Skovgaard introduced a novel way of using this technology by
combining it with copy-number analysis of template DNA in
fast-growing bacterial cultures of E.c0li (Skovgaard et al.,
2011). Instead of mapping reads obtained from stationary cul-
ture where copy number is constant, they obtained clear con-
trasting behavior of reads from DNA of exponentially growing
cultures conﬁrming presence of a large inversion.

In 2012, Sun et al (2012) used 454 pyro-sequencing combined
with a ‘split mapping’ computational method to detect spontan-
eously occurring genome rearrangements (SGRs) from fast-

growing culture of Salmonella sp.. Breakpoints were determined
to base pair resolution, and experimental veriﬁcation of break-
points of SGRs was carried out by padlock probe hybridization
(Sun et al., 2012).

Detecting SVs accurately from real data can be challenged by
limitations in experiment designs, few validated SVs and low
resolution of breakpoints. In contrast to this, there is equal prob-
ability of imperfections present in the algorithms design rather
than the laboratory issues such as reporting of false positives or
missing out true positives. In light of this, in 2013, Bartenhagen
devised a tool RSVSim, which is a fully simulated approach for
detecting SVs (Bartenhagen and Dugas, 2013). It can simulate
ﬁve types of most common SVs for practically any type of
genome. Artiﬁcially rearranged genomes from RSVSim can
serve as performance evaluators for NGS-based algorithms.

Apart from the above discussed tools and algorithms for SV
detection, there are a number of other tools (Supplementary Table
S2) as well that can be explored in context of prokaryotic genomes
and are worth mentioning such as Pindel (Ye et al., 2009), SegSeq
(Chiang et al., 2009), BreakDancer (Chen et al., 2009), SVDetect
(Zeitouni et al., 2010), DELLY (Rausch et al., 2012), SVM2
(Chiara et al., 2012) and PRISM (J iang et al., 2012). More details
about these tools, what they detect and their advantages and limi-
tations are provided in Supplementary Table S2.

7 CONCLUSIONS AND FUTURE DIRECTIONS

The present knowledge and repertoire of SVs in prokaryotic gen-
omes is limited to a handful of examples. Although the pheno-
typic consequences of many of the SVs are not well understood,
the known repertoire of phenotypic consequences suggests their
role in a wide spectrum of physiological and phenotypic out-
comes (Deurenberg et al., 2007). The lack in the understanding

Structural variations in prokaryotic genomes

 

of genomic landscape of structural variability and its phenotypic
consequences in prokaryotes was primarily due to the paucity of
large-scale genome data for closely related organisms, and recent
evidence suggests that this is rapidly changing (Skovgaard et al.,
2011; Srivatsan et al., 2008). The availability of high-throughput
sequencing technologies (NGS) offers the throughput, scale and
cost-effectiveness required to do genome-wide associations for
speciﬁc traits or phenotypes in prokaryotes. This would require
two major gaps in the area to be addressed. The primary one
being methodologies to phenotypically screen large populations
of prokaryotes and secondly the computational algorithms,
which can decipher, map and report genomic variations at
large scale for these screens in short time.

Also the availability of longer read lengths that could encom-
pass repeat regions could also provide immense insights into SVs
in prokaryotic genomes. The deciphering of the genomic vari-
ability in E.c0li strain from the German outbreak is worth men-
tioning (Rasko et al., 2011) where longer read lengths and
computational algorithms were extensively used to decipher add-
itional SVs, which were not previously annotated, and could
provide new insights into the evolution and pathogenicity of
the strain. The availability of datasets in the public domain for
a number of prokaryotic species (Tatusova et al., 2014) provides
a unique opportunity to understand the structural variability in
prokaryotes. Although the phenotypic correlates for many of
these strains would not be available, the extent of information
could, however, provide enormous insights toward deriving a
baseline map of polymorphic SVs in these genomes, a much
needed resource toward inferring phenotypic correlates.

The in-depth understanding of SVs and its phenotypic conse-
quences would see its widespread applications in a number of
areas. The major area that could beneﬁt from this knowledge is
Synthetic Biology (Marguet et al., 2007). The understanding of
gene arrangement, organization and positioning could exten-
sively be used to engineer new genes and pathways and contrib-
ute to a set of rules for designing and engineering genomes. As
interest in engineering bacterial genomes increases, the need for
developing efﬁcient tools for their successful manipulation also
increases. Site-speciﬁc recombination system such as the Cre-lox
system has been used to create deletions in E.c0li (Fukiya et al.,
2004) and large inversions in Lactacaccus lactis (Campo et al.,
2004). Recently, a new technology called GETR (Genome
Editing Via Targetrons and Recombinases) has been introduced
for genome engineering of practically any bacteria (Enyeart
et al., 2013). The technique has been efﬁciently used to introduce
insertions, deletions, inversions and translocations in E.c0li,
S.aureus and Bacillus subtilis. For efﬁcient genome engineering,
it is required to induce DSBs in the DNA to initiate the recom-
bination process. For a long time, it was not possible to induce
DSBs owing to the lack of means to target DSBs to speciﬁc sites,
however, with the introduction of technologies to synthesize and
assemble large fragments of DNA (Ellis et al., 2011), and tools
capable of accurately editing genomic regions have made it pos-
sible. The availability of genome editing tools like ZF-TFs (zinc
ﬁnger transcription factors; Gommans et al., 2005), CRISPR/
CAS [clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/
CRISPR—associated (Cas) systems; Cong et al., 2013] and
TALENS (Transcription activator-like effector nucleases;
Miller et al., 2011) could provide the much necessary

technological prowess to be able to accurately engineer genomes
for strain improvements toward speciﬁc applications. It may not
be excessively optimistic to believe that the rules of genome or-
ganization would ﬁnd extensive application in genome engineer-
ing and genome design.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We describe a modular MATLAB® Toolbox named
TACTICS for time-lapse image analysis that meets several require-
ments not generally offered by currently available software packages:
(i) the ability to assess quality of extracted imaging information by
directly linking data end points to the original position, (ii) massively
parallel analysis of each parameter, for flow cytometry-like assess-
ment of possible relationships between parameters within sub-
populations of the images, (iii) options for user control of the tracking
such as an interface to restrict the analysis region, (iv) manual correc-
tion of automated processes and (v) user interfaces for post-tracking
analysis that is linked to the original images, including options to view
cell pedigrees and normalized polarization ratios based on fluores-
cence ratiometric measurements.

Availability and implementation: We provide TACTICS source code
as well as video tutorials, data sample and comprehensive user guide
on the TACTICS toolbox website (http://www.tactics—toolbox.com).
Installation of TACTICS requires MATLAB 7.6 (R2008a) with the pres-
ence of Image Processing T°°'b°XTM and Statistics ToolboxT'V'.

1 INTRODUCTION

The past decade has seen dramatically increased use of time-lapse
microscopy to address how cells communicate and respond to
external signals. Owing to the volume and complexity of output
from time-lapse imaging, biologists require a simple yet
high-throughput platform with which to extract meaningful
data. Herein, we present a generic platform for High Content
Analysis (HCA) that is straightforward yet multi-featured
and highly adaptable by MATLAB developers. TACTICS is
structured from several collaborative modules that can be inter-
actively used for extraction, inspection and presentation of time-
lapse imaging data. This simpliﬁes the analysis scheme, allowing
unfamiliar users to use the program intuitively. Each TACTICS
module enables user-friendly visualization of the original, ﬁl-
tered and segmented images with optional display of cell index,
trajectories and proximity vectors between cells in different

channels. The TACTICS graphical user interface
is characterized by selection tools and interactive slider-bars
(Altman, 2012) that simplify the optimization of settings
for image processing. Information about the image-processing
procedures and the experimental information is collected
and stored. Some aspects of the application of TACTICS
to analyse migrating lymphocytes have been illustrated
recently (Pham et al., 2013), and further features are described
below.

2 FEATURES

Organization. To set up the experiment, the user inputs a set of
tiff images into an experiment generator tool for preliminary
inspection. Experimental folders are then created on the basis
of position or optical section (for confocal microscopy). Up to
six parametric image sequences—x, y, z, time, multi-channel (dif-
ferent ﬂuorescent wavelengths) and multiple positions—can be
processed in batch mode with a button click. This approach has
been recently used to analyse immune cells conﬁned in micro-
fabricated microwells during long-term time-lapse observations
(Pham et al., 2013). Additionally, the segmentation module
offers an interface for customized ﬁlters to improve the quality
of the original raw ﬁles, such as denoising and contrast enhance-
ment. An interactive pop-up menu enables automated segmen-
tation, including generation of virtual channels. Similar to other
interactive approaches such as ‘ICY’ (de Chaumont et al., 2012),
chained image processing enables the user to efﬁciently explore
different combinations of ﬁltering and arithmetic operations.
The user can export and import different combinations of pro-
cessing settings for high throughput analysis, and the applied
settings are logged on a frame-by-frame basis. Current segmen-
tation methods use the Otsu MATLAB built-in function,
Kmeans and Level Set Evolution (Li et al., 2010). The most
frequently used cell-separation approaches to separate touching
cells (intensity splitting algorithm and watershed) can be applied
with a single mouse click on the region deﬁning the joined cells.
Alternative automated cell-segmentation approaches can be
easily incorporated in addition to more morphological and arith-
metic operations.

Manual correction. Objects within the binary images are iden-
tiﬁed and labelled as individual cells. A default tracking algo-
rithm that assumes random migration is automatically applied.
To track dividing cells, an algorithm associates the two daughter
cells based on the cell trajectories and the point of cell division.

Where visual inspection indicates errors in the automated seg-
mentation or tracking, an interface for manual correction is
available. False detections can be removed with a mouse click
using the Cell Tracking Module. Poorly segmented cells can be
either improved or discarded. Developers can easily incorporate
other tracking algorithms for other types of migration patterns,
or cell parameters as presented recently (Georgescu et al., 2012).
Options for manual correction of the tracks include rejection of
invalid track points, deﬁnition of a new track point, track split-
ting (following a cell division) and track ﬂipping. Finally, all
tracks can be ﬁltered out by optional parameters such as velocity
and length.

Massively parallel analysis. Quantitative information about
morphological and geometric descriptors of each cell is extracted
and logged. Next, the Measurements Module enables visualiza-
tion and data exploration to quantify the spatiotemporal history
of a speciﬁc cell, record data on population basis and quantify
properties such as asymmetry of ﬂuorescence. TACTICS can
analyse multi-spectral images of multiple labelled cells, enabling
quantiﬁcation of intracellular protein localization by combining
one channel for segmentation and tracking, a second channel for
alignment and a third channel to quantify the protein of interest.
Once deﬁned, a customized list of cell features such as morph-
ology, cell migration, ﬂuorescence ratiometric coefﬁcients and
protein localization is automatically generated and saved to a
selected folder in the multiple-position batch mode to create
data libraries. The list is adaptable, and developers can easily
add other features by requirement (Schindelin et al., 2012).
Importantly, these parameters can be displayed and compared
on a cell-by-cell basis, and the data can be ‘gated’ on the basis of
individual parameters to determine correlations between differ-
ent parameters as demonstrated previously (Pham et al., 2013).

The Measurements Module allows the combined quantiﬁca-
tion and visualization from multiple channels, such as the ability
to track interactions between cells in different channels.
Applications include the generation of lineage trees to track cel-
lular behaviours over many generations, and traceable descrip-
tors of immune cell velocity with direction of movement and
proximity to other interacting cells. Each module in TACTICS
can be re-called repeatedly for each position by using the Robust
Module to automate the extraction of multi-parameter informa-
tion from many simultaneously imaged individual cells on a
population basis. Thus, TACTICS provides high-throughput

automation with minimum human intervention, with the cap-
acity to refer back to the original images throughout the process.
In summary, TACTICS provides both ease of use for biologists
with limited software expertise, as well as the ﬂexibility for de-
velopers to incorporate additional bioinformatic processes for
cell segmentation and cell tracking.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

TACTICS source code is distributed under the BSD Licence.

TACTICS can be installed as a MATLAB app or by unpack-
ing a compressed ﬁle to the desired folder. It requires at least
MATLAB 7.6 (R2008a) with the presence of Image Processing®
and Statistics® Toolboxes. Several shared third-party functions
are used within the main TACTICS folder, and need be add-
itionally installed. All these ﬁles are located in separate
open-code subfolders, with proper acknowledgements to its con-
tributors including direct links to the original ﬁles.

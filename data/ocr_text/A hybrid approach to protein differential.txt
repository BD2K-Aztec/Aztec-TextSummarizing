ABSTRACT

Motivation: Quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics
involves statistical inference on protein abundance, based on the
intensities of each protein’s associated spectral peaks. However,
typical MS-based proteomics datasets have substantial proportions
of missing observations, due at least in part to censoring of low
intensities. This complicates intensity-based differential expression
analysis.

Results: We outline a statistical method for protein differential
expression, based on a simple Binomial likelihood. By modeling peak
intensities as binary, in terms of ‘presence/absence,’ we enable the
selection of proteins not typically amenable to quantitative analysis;
e.g. ‘one-state’ proteins that are present in one condition but absent
in another. In addition, we present an analysis protocol that combines
quantitative and presence/absence analysis of a given dataset in a
principled way, resulting in a single list of selected proteins with a
single-associated false discovery rate.

1 INTRODUCTION

A key goal of quantitative mass spectrometry-based proteomics is
statistical inference on differential protein expression. Quantitative
information is derived from spectral peak intensities that are
identiﬁed as having come from one of a protein’s constituent
peptides. Statistical procedures for differential protein expression
are naturally constructed in the context of regression or AN OVA, or
as a ‘rollup’ problem (Polpitiya et al., 2008).

However, intensity-based procedures are challenged by the
presence of widespread missing intensities. It is typical for 20—40%
of the total collection of attempted measurements to be missing;
that is, in a matrix with all identiﬁed peptides in the rows, samples
in the columns, 20—40% of the matrix cell entries are empty. With
standard regression or AN OVA procedures, peptides with missing
values must either be removed from the analysis, or their missing
values must be imputed. There will typically be very few peptides
with no missing values, so ﬁltering peptides in this way results in a

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

much less informative dataset. Furthermore, previously-published
reports indicate that the vast majority of missing values are the
results of censoring of absent or low-abundance peptides (Wang
et al., 2003). This means that simple imputation routines are not
appropriate (Little and Rubin, 2002).

Parametric imputation and other specialized methodology can
be employed to enable intensity-based inference with lessened
information loss (KarpieVitch et al., 2009). However, some
information loss is inevitable. In particular, ‘one-state’ (or nearly
so) peptides, those for which there are many observed intensities
in one comparison group but few in another comparison group, are
not amenable to an intensity-based analysis; not limited to the two-
class problem. As a result, such peptides are typically ﬁltered out
of an intensity-based analysis. A protein that is always present in a
diseased state, say, and never in the healthy state would be of great
biological interest, so it is unfortunate if our statistical methodology
cannot identify such a protein.

An alternative to an intensity-based analysis is a ‘presence/
absence’ analysis, in which peak intensities are digitized into binary
measurements depending on whether a peak was observed or not.
This is analogous to the spectral counting approach in MS/MS
studies (Zybailov et al., 2005), where a peptide is quantiﬁed by
the number of fragmentation spectra assigned to it. Data collected
in our laboratory do not necessarily have MS/MS fragmentation data
associated with it, instead being obtained according to the accurate
mass and time tag pipeline (Smith et al. , 2002; Zimmer et al., 2006).
Still, we have information on whether or not a particular peptide was
observed in each sample.

While presence/absence analysis is better-suited to ﬁnding
one-state proteins, it necessarily has less statistical power to
detect abundance differences in proteins with little to moderate
missingness. Ideally, protein differential expression analysis would
simultaneously target proteins of both types, resulting in a single
list of differentially expressed proteins, with a single-associated
false discovery rate (FDR). A hierarchical Bayesian model would
be well-suited to this purpose, but such techniques are complex,
computationally intensive and less amenable to high-throughput
pipelines.

We present a hybrid analysis protocol that consists of two stages:
(i) intensity-based analysis, and (ii) a presence/absence analysis. The
results of each are merged to create a single collection of ‘interesting’
proteins, to which we use novel methodology to apply a single
FDR. This enables the researcher to extract more information from
a quantitative proteomic dataset than would be achievable by either
approach alone, while still maintaining an interpretable measure

of overall statistical conﬁdence. For the proposed hybrid analysis
protocol, we demonstrate the following: (i) resulting FDR estimates
are conservative; (ii) one-state proteins are consistently selected
as differentially expressed; and (iii) the number of differentially
expressed proteins selected at a speciﬁed FDR exceeds that either
intensity-based or presence/absence analysis alone.

2 METHODS
2.1 Data

2.1.] Diabetes These data are as previously described, containing label-
free proteomic measurements on human patients with and without Type II
diabetes (Karpievitch et al., 2009).

2.1.2 Filtering based on peptide detectability To minimize the number
of sibling peptides with large missingness proportion differences, we use
PeptideSieve (Mallick et al., 2007) to ﬁlter peptides whose amino acid
sequences are unlikely to be detected by MS. In all 554 peptides are ﬁltered
out before carrying on any further analysis.

2.1.3 Simulation We carried out simulation studies as follows, to
investigate the operating characteristics of our methodology at both peptide
and protein levels. Peptide-level data were generated from a Binomial
model, under the same conditions as the diabetes data (two comparison
groups with 10 samples in each); the Binomial model is appropriate, since
presence/absence data can be Viewed as success/failure of independent
Bernoulli trials. Presence probabilities in group one took the values on
p1 = 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5. Half of the group-two peptides were assigned the same
presence probabilities as their group-one counterparts. In the other half,
differential presence probabilities were created, with probability differences
(comparing group two to group one) ofpd =p2 —p1 =0.1,0.2,--- ,0.9 —p1.
Separate simulations were carried out for each of the group-one presence
probability values with even replications on different pd settings.

Similarly, for protein-level data, the number of peptides per protein
was randomly selected to range between 1 and 30. Protein-level presence
probabilities also took the values p1=O.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 and pd 2 p2 — p1 =
01,02,  ,0.9 — p1. For each constituent peptide, the group-one peptide-
level presence probability equaled the protein-level probability multiplied by
a randomly-selected number between 0 and 1 (to allow for different levels
of detectability for peptides of the same protein). Peptide-level differential
presence probabilities were handled as described for the peptide-level
simulation above.

Finally, to simulate data for use by the hybrid method, with both
peak intensities and presence/absence indicators, we randomly generated
intensities from a Normal distribution with parameters chosen to mimic
the diabetes data. Missingness proportions took the values 10, 20, 30
and 40%, with missingness created by censoring the lowest corresponding
percentages of peptide intensities. As in the above simulations, half of the
peptides/proteins were given differential expression, now deﬁned in terms
of mean intensity levels. Differential intensity magnitudes took both low-
magnitude values of 1, 2, as well as high-magnitude values of 5, 10, all on
the log scale.

2.2 Logistic model for protein presence/absence

Logistic regression is a natural analysis method for presence/absence data,
given their binary nature. Speciﬁcally, let Yijkl be the indicator for whether
a peak was observed for peptide j of protein i in comparison group k
and sample I. Then, we can say Yijk1~Binomial(1,p,-jk) for l=1,2,...,nk,
where nk is the number of samples in comparison group k. A simple logistic
regression model would then be

logit(p,-jk) = Proti + Pepij +Grpik. (1)

Here, Proti represents the overall (across all comparison groups) log odds
of peak presence for protein i, Pepij is the effect of peptide j of protein
i (assumed to be the same across all k comparison groups), and Grpik
is the protein-level effect of comparison group k in protein i. Usual sum-
to-zero constraints apply; namely,  Pepij =0 and ZkK=lGrpik :0 for
i: 1,2, . . . ,M, where M is the total number of proteins in the data.

For the purposes of comparing protein presence probabilities across
comparison groups, the parameters of interest are the Grpik, i = 1,2, . . . ,M.
For example, in the diabetes data, K :2, with k=1,2 corresponding to
the diabetic and control groups, respectively. Hence, Grpil —Grp,-2 is the
log odds ratio for protein i, comparing diabetics to controls. Testing for a
difference in presence probabilities corresponds to testing the null hypothesis
that Grpil —Grp,-2=0; given the model’s sum-to-zero constraints, this is
equivalent to the null hypothesis that Grpil =Grpi220. Of course, the
model is not restricted to the two-class case and can naturally be generalized
to the K -class case, in which the corresponding null hypothesis is that
Grpil = Grpiz = ' " = GrpiK-

Unfortunately, logistic regression is not well-suited in practice to the
analysis of presence/absence data. In particular, biologically-interesting
proteins are liable to be missed entirely, due to inherent limitations of the
methodology. Consider a ‘one-state’ protein, present in all samples for one
comparison group, absent in all samples for the other comparison groups.
From a biological perspective, this would be a very interesting protein.
However, in logistic model, the p-Value for such a protein will tend to
be reported as nearly equal to one, meaning that the protein would not be
selected as differentially expressed under any reasonable criteria.

A simple scenario illustrates this problem. Consider a ‘one-state’ protein
with just a single peptide. In logistic regression, the assumed variance-
covariance matrix for regression coefﬁcients is (X/ WX)_1, where X is the
model matrix, and W is diagonal with entries pk(1 —pk), with pk the presence
probability in comparison group k, k = 1,2. For comparison groups in which
no peaks were observed, the estimated value of pk is zero, making the
corresponding entry in W equal to zero. This results in an overestimation of
the standard error for the group effect model term, hence an understatement
of statistical signiﬁcance for that protein’s group effect. In the diabetes data,
for example, ‘one-state’ proteins are assigned p-Values of one.

2.3 Exact peptide-level tests

In light of the logistic regression limitations, we propose an exact procedure
for testing for differences in presence/absence between two comparison
groups. Let yjk. =Zy=1yjkl be the number of observed peaks for peptide
j in comparison k, k=1,2. We use szlij—yjzl as the peptide-level
test statistic. Based on the Binomial probability model, the exact sampling
distribution of T]- under the null hypothesis H0 of no difference in presence
probabilities can be written as

n1 —t n2

PrH0(7}-=t)=Z Z B(m1;n1,pjo)xB(m2;n2,pjo)

m1=0 m2=m1+t

n2—t n1

+2 2 B(m1;n1,pjo)xB(m2;n2,pjo)

m2 =0 m1=m2+t

where B(m; n, p) is the Binomial PMF at m, with n trials and probability of
success p and pjo is the shared probability of peak presence for both groups.
Thus, based on an observed statistic of tj, the p-Value is Zt>tPrHo(1} =t).
In practice, we need only to estimate the shared presence probability
under the null hypothesis, pjo, to approximate the p-Value for a given
peptide. We estimate pjo with a pooled sample proportion, resulting in
ﬁjo = Z], nkf’jk/Zk nk, where ﬁjk =yjk-/nk, K = 2-

As an example, consider a ‘one-state’ peptide, present in all samples
of one group but in no samples of the other group, in the diabetes data.
Whereas logistic regression reports a p-Value of one, the exact test correctly
highlights the peptide as statistically signiﬁcant. Speciﬁcally, the test statistic

T]- equals 10, and 131-0 2 0.5, so the p-Value is computed as 2 x B(10; 10, 0.5) x
B(0;10,0.5)< 0.0001

2.4 Bootstrap protein-level tests

For inference at the protein level, there is the added challenge of multiple
peptides belonging to the same protein. To incorporate all sibling peptides
into a single test for differential presence probabilities, we use the following
test statistic:

(2)

TMl- =

 

Z Kij (yijl- —yijz-)

'=1,...,m,-

 

where i is protein index, j is peptide index and k is comparison group index,
i=1,2,...,M, j=1,2,...,m,-, k=1,---,K, K=2. The statistic in (2) is a
weighted average of observed presence difference on each sibling peptide.
For the weighting term [6,7, we use Ki]- =yij.. / 21-);in

A parametric bootstrap procedure (Efron and Tibshirani, 2002) is used
to approximate the sampling distribution of the TM,- under null hypothesis
setting as follows. First the Binomial parameters pijk are estimated, for
which two approaches are considered. The ﬁrst approach simply uses the
sample proportion for peptide j of protein i in comparison group k being
present, which needs 2 x m,- parameter estimation per protein. Alternatively,
we approaching the problem by inducing some structure between the pijk,
assuming that pijk =pik xdij, where pik is the overall presence probability
for protein i in comparison group k, and dij is the ‘detectability’ probability
(the probability that a particular ion species is detected by the LC-MS
instrument) for peptide j of protein i. This assumption of structure translates
to an assumption that the detectability of a peptide does not differ between
comparison groups. Since detectability is a function of chemical composition
rather than abundance (Mallick et al., 2007), this seems a reasonable
assumption. After introducing the structure assumption the number of
parameters per protein to be estimated reduces from K x m,- to K +m,-.

With the second approach, the presence probability pik of protein i in
group k is estimated by averaging the presence proportion of its top 10% most
prevalent peptides (rounded up to the nearest integer number of peptides).

A ﬁnk
l€{t0p10%}#{t0p 10% Peptldes}

The rationale here is that, for these most prevalent peptides, the detectability
probability will be close to one, making pijk Npik. Then ink is used to estimate

dij as dy = %  +...+  ), Where ﬁiﬂg and ink are the sample presence
proportions. Clearly, this estimation approach will work best for proteins
with several peptides detected; with few peptides, the above calculation may
be based on the single most-abundant peptide. Still, we point to the Results
section as evidence of adequate performance overall.

Since we have ink and dij, according to the equation pijk =pik x dij, the null
sampling distribution of our test statistic could be generated by parametric
bootstrap. Under the null hypothesis setting, the presence probabilities of
protein i across K comparison groups are the same and set to be pio. In two
group case, pio =pi1 =pi2 and 13,0 2 pilgpiz. Thus, for peptide j of protein i
in group k, nk zeroes or ones are generated from the Binomial distribution
with probability fail-k =f),-k xdij, k=1,2. We run B bootstrap iterations and
compute the test statistic (2), TM}, in each iteration. The p-Value is then
computed as the proportion of bootstrap test statistic values being as or more
extreme as our observed TM,- value:

p B

2.5 FDR estimation

The FDR associated with a list of features selected at a p-Value cutoff cp
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) is the expected number of false positives F
out of the total number of selected features S:

FDR —E FCP ~E[FCP] 3

Fig. 1. P-Value histograms of simulated null peptides with shared presence
probabilities of 0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 across each comparison group. The null
sampling distribution is non-uniform, due to the discrete nature of the test
statistic

The denominator can be replaced simply with the observed number of
selected features. The traditional approach to estimate the numerator is to
exploit the expected uniform sampling distribution of the null p-Values
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003). In particular, we can estimate E[Fcp] by
M x fro x cp, where M is the total number of features and fro is the estimated
proportion of null features out of the total M features. However, as our
test statistic is discrete, its null sampling distribution is not necessarily
Uniform. As an example, Figure 1 shows a simulated null sampling
distribution for peptide-level test statistics, in which the shape of the null
sampling distribution is quite non-Uniform and could depend on many
factors, including the number of peptides of a protein, the sample size of
each comparison group and the overall number of observed peaks of a
protein. With discrete test statistics, standard FDR estimates will tend to
be conservative (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995; Benjamini and Yekutieli,
2001). There is some published work aimed speciﬁcally at FDR estimation
with discrete test statistics (Gilbert, 2005; Pounds and Cheng, 2006).

2.5.1 Peptide-level FDR estimation A more general way to describe the
estimate of the numerator in Equation (3) is as a weighted sum of calculations
from the estimated null p-Value distribution:

EIFC,I=Zw,-cﬁ:jo<cp),
J'

where wj is a weight (number between 0 and 1), and (ﬁ‘jo is the estimated
cumulative distribution function (CDF) for null features. In the case of a
continuous test statistic, the null p-Value distribution is known to be U (0, 1),
so no actual estimation of CDFJ-o is required. Since the right-tail probability
of the U (0, 1) distribution at cp is equal to cp, we would simply have
(jig-owl”) 2 cp for all j. The weights wj would ideally be selected in a way
to give prominence to (take values closer to one for) null peptides. With a
continuous test statistic, since (ﬁ‘jo (cp) 2 cp for all j, we can replace the W]-
with an estimate of the number of null features, rather than having to weight
each feature individually. Thus, with the traditional estimate of the numerator
in Equation (3), the wj are replaced with M x fro. Again, our challenge in
the present context is that our peptide-level test statistic is not continuous.
With this in mind, we derive a peptide-level FDR estimate by proceeding
from the more general formulation above. Speciﬁcally, we specify peptide-
speciﬁc weights wj and use the assumed Binomial nature of presence/absence
observations to derive estimates of the null p-Value CDF for each peptide,
as follows.

A hybrid approach to protein differential expression

 

The estimate of CDFJ-o is derived from an estimate of the null probability
mass function (PMF) for peptide j, which is assumed to be Binomial:

PMFJ-0(cp) = I5ro(7} = TJ-(ch

= Z Pr(in|f?j0)XPf(sz|f)j0),
Tj=Tj(Cp)

where pjo = (le + YJ-z) / (n1 +n2) is a pooled estimate of presence probability
for peptide j under the null hypothesis that pjl =pj2. For the wj, we use

Wj—

_ 1 if ﬁj0(cp)Zﬁ/I\Fﬂ(cp)
0 if otherwise

This corresponds to calling a peptide null if its estimated null PMF is greater
than its PMF estimated without restricting that the null hypothesis be true.
We therefore estimate the peptide-level FDR as

ijIcﬁJJ-omep»

FDR c =
pep< p) #{p—valuegcp}

In what follows, we refer to an ‘unweighted’ FDR estimate as that resulting
from setting all wj equal to one.

2.5.2 FDR estimates for multi-peptide proteins Our simulation studies
indicate that for most settings, the p-Value of the test statistic for multi-peptide
protein (2) is approximately uniformly distributed under null hypothesis
setting, especially when there are moderate overall levels of presence (data
not shown) and moderate number of sibling peptides in a protein. Because
of this, we use the standard (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) method for FDR
estimation. ‘Namely, at p-Value cutoff cp, we estimate the FDR as which
could also be seen as a uniform weight across proteins wj =M x fro across
all proteins’.
Pﬁprowp) : M x no X cp

# {p — values 5 cp}
where M is the total number of proteins, and fro is the estimated proportion of
null proteins, We estimate no by ﬁtting a smooth lowess curve to the values
of from) =#{p—Values > A}/M(1—A), then choosing fro as the ﬁtted value
of the smooth curve as A —> 1 (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003).

2.5.3 Weighted FDR estimation for mixed single and multi-peptide proteins
In practice, both single-peptide proteins and multi-peptide proteins are
usually mixed in a dataset, for which we have developed p-Value and FDR
estimation separately. The two sets of p-Value are left as is whereas a uniﬁed
FDR estimate needs to be generated based on the pooled set of p-Values. The
numerator of FDR for mixed case is given by summing up the estimation
of expected number of false positive features for single-peptide protein
and multi-peptide proteins, as indicated in the above two sections, and the
denominator is the number of selected features based on the p-Value pool.
ﬁnﬁx (cp) = M
#{ p — value 5 cp}
ijjﬁjo(1}(cp))+M x fro x cp

_ #{ p — values 3 5 cp or p — valuesm 5 cp}

 

where p-Valuess are the p-Values for single-peptide proteins and p-Valuesm
are those for multi-peptide proteins; the ‘#’ notation is used to indicate
‘number of’.

2.6 Hybrid analysis incorporating both
presence/absence and intensity measurements

The above methodology has dealt only with presence/absence data,

from which peak intensity measurements are excluded. The rationale for

simplifying peak intensity measurements to presence/absence is that it better

enables discovery of ‘one-state’ (or similar) proteins. However, statistical

information is lost by throwing out intensity measurements, which would
translate to decreased statistical power to detect differentially expressed
proteins that differ in terms of abundance but not presence/absence. Thus,
we would ideally incorporate both peak intensity and presence/absence
information into a differential expression analysis. One simple way to do
this is to carry out separate intensity-based and presence/absence-based
analysis, select proteins at a speciﬁed FDR from each analysis, then report the
union of the two resulting protein lists. However, while we might intuitively
expect a small FDR for the resulting list of proteins, we will not generally
be able to assign an actual FDR estimate. In what follows, we derive a
FDR estimate for the union list of differentially expressed proteins. Thus,
taken together, the methodology presented here allows the researcher to
select a list of differentially expressed proteins, some based on intensity
and others based on presence/absence, to which an overall FDR estimate
can be assigned.

We use a single p-Value threshold cp for both intensity measurements
and presence/absence; so, a protein is selected if either of its intensity-based
and presence/absence p-Values are less than cp. Intensity-based p-Values are
derived from regression models and censored likelihoods from our prior
work (Karpievitch et al., 2009). Let p—Valueb and p—Valuep correspond to
the binary presence/absence and peak intensity measurements, respectively.
The FDR for a hybrid analysis can then be estimated by

A -w-I5r —Value -<c U —Value -<c
FDRh(cp)=Zz l 0(P 171— p P 171— p)

 

# {p — values}, 5 cp or p — valuesp 5 cp}

ZiwiPAro [cp +(1— cp)Rr (TM. 2 TM. (cp))]

# {p — values}, 5 cp or p — valuesp 5 cp}

 

We set the weight w,- equal to the average of the binary weight and the uniform
weight derived from Storey and Tibishirani’s FDR estimation scheme in the
intensity-based method (Karpievitch et al., 2009).

3 RESULT

3.1 Simulation data

Table 1 shows Type I error and power for the proposed
presence/absence methodology applied to simulated single-peptide
and ﬁve-peptide proteins. As would be expected, we have greater
power to detect differential expression when there are multiple
peptides in a protein. The pool of number of peptides of a
protein is 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, the presence probability of proteins take
value among p1=0.2,0.3,0.4,0.5 and pd =p2 —p1 =0.1,  ,0.9—
p1, peptide detectablity is set to vary among 0.9,0.7,0.5,0.1,0.01.

Figure 2 shows the number of signiﬁcant single-peptide
proteins versus FDR, based on the proposed peptide-level
presence/absence methodology. The particular simulation scenario
displayed in the ﬁgure has p1=0.3, with a random mixture of
differential presence/absence, ranging over pd=0.1,0.2,...,0.6.
The unweighted FDR estimate is very conservative, resulting
in many fewer signiﬁcant peptides at a given FDR estimate,
relative to the true FDR curve. The binary weighting improves
this somewhat, resulting in greater power while maintaining
conservative FDR estimation. In the Supplementary Materials, we
include similar ﬁgures for a variety of p1 and pd values. We
also include simulation-based comparisons with the Benjamini—
Hochberg estimator (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and that of
Pounds and Cheng (Pounds and Cheng, 2006); the simulations
suggest that our proposed FDR estimates are more powerful across
the board, likely the result of our estimators having been developed
speciﬁcally for the presence/absence problem.

to other estimators, including the Benjamini—Hochberg estimator
(Storey, 2002).

Our ﬁnal simulation contains a combination of single- and multi—
peptide proteins, a variety of differential expression magnitudes,
with a sample size of 10 in each of the 2 comparison groups. In this
case, peak intensities were simulated, from which presence/absence
data were obtained, to reﬂect the intended real-world setting in
which both intensity-based and binary presence/ absence information
is available. Table 2 compares the proposed hybrid approach with
both our ‘qualitative’ (presence/absence-based) and previously-
published ‘quantitative’ (intensity-based) (Karpievitch et al., 2009)
methodology. The table shows numbers of differentially expressed
proteins at an estimated FDR of 0.05, for a variety of simulation
settings (varying the proportion of missing data as well as the amount
and magnitude of differential expression). The hybrid approach

a given FDR, than either of the presence/absence- or intensity-
based approaches. Thus, by combining a traditional intensity-based
analysis with a presence/absence analysis, we are able to supplement
our ﬁndings with additional proteins of interest; these would
potentially include ‘one-state’ proteins.

3.2 Diabetes data

The original dataset is comprised of 177 proteins and 1396
peptides. Figure 4 compares the proposed hybrid approach with
presence/absence- and intensity-based approaches. The hybrid
approach consistently results in greater numbers of differentially
expressed proteins, at a given FDR. In this case, this is largely due
to the presence/absence method supplementing the intensity-based
method with proteins that were ﬁltered out of the analysis due to
too many missing values. Seventeen proteins were selected by the
presence/absence method but not by the intensity-based method. Of
these, several have known relevance to diabetes: a ketohexokinase
isoform (IP100216136.1) (Cirillo et al., 2009), a clusterin isoform
(IP100291262.3) (Daimon et al., 2011), a 08 beta chain complement
component (IP100294395 .1) (Zhang et al., 2011), apolipoprotein E
(IP100021842.1) (Bach-Ngohou et al., 2002), apolipoprotein C-III
(IP100021857.1) (Juntti-Berggren et al., 2004), and apolipoprotein
C—I (IP100021855.1) (van der Ham et al., 2009).

4 DISCUSSION

The proposed presence/absence-based methodology is designed to
enable the detection of ‘one-state’ (or similar) proteins that are not
amenable to traditional intensity-based methods. Furthermore, we
have proposed a hybrid approach that combines both intensity- and
presence/absence-based analysis of a dataset, together with FDR
estimation of the combined list of differentially expressed proteins.
The proposed hybrid approach was demonstrated to outperform
either of the intensity- or presence/absence—based methods alone.
An obvious limitation to our work is its applicability to only two
comparison groups. A regression-based implementation would be
more generalizable, and we intend to pursue this in our future work.

The choices of weights in the peptide-level and hybrid methods
could undoubtedly be improved upon as well; all FDR estimates are
quite conservative.

ABSTRACT

Summary: DroPhEA is a core module of a web application that
facilitates research in insect functional genomics through enrichment
analysis on mutant phenotypes of fruit fly (Drosophila melanogaster).
The phenotypes investigated in the analyses can be predefined by
FlyBase or customized by users. DroPhEA allows users to specify
mutation or ortholog types, displays enriched term results in a
hierarchical structure and supports analyses on gene sets of all insect
species with a fully sequenced genome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Enrichment analysis is a promising strategy for investigators to
biologically interpret gene lists obtained from high-throughput
studies in the post-genomic era. Among the backend annotations
employed in different enrichment tools (see review in Huang et al.,
2009), mutant phenotype annotation is unique because it represents
the consequence of altering the information output of a gene.
Therefore, annotations of phenotypes are an ideal means to aid in
the understanding of how a set of genes function within the context
of the whole organism.

Studies in fruit-ﬂy biology were ﬁrst documented in the early
1900s (Rubin and Lewis, 2000); over the last century, Drosophila
has become one of the most widely used model organisms for
animal genetics and developmental biology. As an insect species,
in addition to basic genetics studies, Drosophila has served as a
model to assist in agricultural and epidemiological investigations.
The richness and comprehensiveness of ﬂy omics data have been
invaluable to many ﬁelds of biology. Currently, the proportion of
mutated and phenotyped ﬂy genes (36.9%; 5606 of 15191 genes
mapped to the genome) is approaching that of the house mouse
(Mus musculus) [~40% of the genes comprising the mouse genome
have been phenotyped; Weng and Liao (2010)]. However, with
the exception of the house mouse (Chen et al., 2009; Weng and
Liao, 2010), an enrichment tool based on mutant phenotypes of
another species has never been developed. Some bioinformatic
tools for insect genomics, such as FlyMine (Lyne et al., 2007),

do not implement mutant phenotype data. Insects and mammals
diverged from each other >900 million years ago (Blair et al. , 2005).
Due to the substantial anatomical, physiological, developmental
and behavioral differences between insects and mammals, it is
challenging to utilize mammalian phenotypes to explore insect
functional genomics.

We therefore developed DroPhEA (@sophila P_henotype
Enrichment Analysis). Similar to MamPhEA, a phenotype
enrichment tool for analyses on mammalian genes (Weng and
Liao, 2010), DroPhEA provides several useful features. First,
DroPhEA allows enrichment analysis not only on phenotypes
predeﬁned by FlyBase (http://ﬂybase.org/), but also on customized
phenotypes to study complex traits. Second, different types of
mutations exhibit distinct impacts on protein function; to remove
potential biases caused by the use of data derived from differential
mutagenesis approaches (Liao and Zhang, 2008), DroPhEA enables
users to perform analyses that exclude phenotypes derived from
gain—of—function mutations. Third, DroPhEA generates graphical
and downloadable output displaying the enriched or depleted
phenotypes according to the hierarchical structure of the phenotypic
classiﬁcation. Finally, due to the paucity of phenotypic data in insect
species other than Drosophila melanogaster, DroPhEA supports
analyses of genes orthologous to D.melcm0gaster for all insect
species with a fully sequenced genome (17 to date). Through
integration with MamPhEA, DroPhEA is also capable of analyzing
mammalian genes.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

Mutant ﬂy phenotypic data were retrieved from FlyBase (version
FB2011_03) (http://ﬂybase.org/). Phenotypic entries resulting from
mutations affecting multiple loci were excluded. FlyBase applies
two hierarchically structured and controlled lexicons to describe
phenotypes: (i) ‘Phenotypic class’ (FBCV term) represents the
pathology, or the effect of the mutation on the whole organism
(e.g. lethal, sterile) and (ii) ‘Anatomy’ (FBbt term) describes
the body part manifested by the mutation (e. g. eye, antenna)
(Drysdale, 2001). Phenotypic descriptions of a ﬂy mutant allele
are often expressed as a compound statement comprising multiple
terms. In such cases, we treated each term in the compound
statement individually. In fact, we found that each composite
term usually contained only one ‘phenotypic class’ FBCV term
or ‘anatomy‘ FBbt term, and the remaining terms were used
as ‘qualiﬁers’ (FBCV20000005; e.g. ‘dominant’) or ‘occurrent’
terms (FBdV:00007008; e.g. ‘pupal stage P5’), among others.
Consequently, most of the compound phenotypic descriptions can

simply be expressed as a ‘phenotypic class’ FBcv term, or ‘anatomy’
FBbt term for subsequent analyses. The analysis of gene sets of other
insect species was supported by obtaining orthology information
of each species to D.melan0gaster from the InParanoid database
(version 7.0, http://inparanoid.sbc.su.se/).

DroPhEA typically compares two gene sets. When one gene set
is provided, it is compared with the rest of the genes in the genome.
Genes without a ‘phenotypic class’ FBcv term or ‘anatomy’ FBbt
term are excluded prior to the analysis. Signiﬁcantly enriched or
depleted phenotypes are detected by Fisher’s exact test. P-values can
be Bonferroni corrected for multiple tests. DroPhEA allows users
to customize phenotypes by combining existing FlyBase controlled
lexicons by a keyword search, or by browsing FBcv or FBbt term
ontologies. Enrichment analysis applying customized phenotypes
gives DroPhEA the capability of exploring complex traits, such as
gene essentiality (see Examples 1.1 and 1.2 in Section 3.1 below).

Default DroPhEA generates graphical output displaying a
hierarchical structure of enriched/depleted phenotypes. DroPhEA
also produces classic output in a simple linear text format showing
differentially enriched phenotypes. J avaServer Pages (J SP) and
MySQL database on an Apache Tomcat server was used to build
the web interface.

3 EXAMPLES

Two examples provided on the DroPhEA website are used to
illustrate the use of DroPhEA in hypothesis testing and knowledge
discovery.

3.1 Essentiality of evolutionarily conserved
(Example 1.1) and lineage-speciﬁc genes
(Example 1.2)

Genes ubiquitous in genomes across a wide range of the
phylogenetic spectrum are likely to perform fundamental biological
functions throughout different taxa and taxonomic levels, and are
therefore expected to be more critical to individual ﬁtness (survival
or reproduction). For the fruit ﬂy, genes vital to ﬁtness (essential
genes) can be deﬁned by association with the lethal or sterile
mutant phenotype (Liao and Zhang, 2008). Therefore, we created
the ‘essentiality’ phenotype by combining the controlled lexicons
FBcv:0000351 (lethal) and FBcv:0000364 (sterile). Consistent with
our expectation, the results indicated 3151 Drosophila genes with
one human ortholog (retrieved from BioMart version 61) exhibited
a strong enrichment in the customized phenotype ‘essentiality’
relative to the genomic background (P: 1.17E-4). Similarly, we
examined 7852 ﬂy lineage-speciﬁc genes, deﬁned as genes without
an ortholog in the human genome based on the BioMart annotation.
Contradictory to the results of the ﬂy-human one-to-one orthologs,
the ﬂy lineage-speciﬁc genes were signiﬁcantly depleted with the
‘essentiality’ phenotype (P = 1.91E-40). This example demonstrates
that DroPhEA is a promising bioinformatic tool to explore complex
traits.

3.2 Genes associated with mosquito blood-feeding
behavior (Example 2)

Blood-feeding behavior is an important characteristic of mosquito

species. To elucidate the genetic components in the insect genome

that have been acquired or are associated with the adaptation

for hematophagy, we downloaded the microarray data of the
blood-feeding malaria mosquito (Anopheles gambiae) (Marinotti
et al., 2005) from VectorBase (release December 2010) (http://
www.vectorbase.orgl). The 20% (2042/ 10 207) of mosquito genes
shown to exhibit the highest increases in expression signals after
a blood meal were analyzed with DroPhEA. Consistent with
our current understanding that mosquito hematophagy is required
for oocyte development (Dana et al., 2005; Marinotti et al.,
2005), the results indicated enrichment of the input gene set
with several reproduction-related or cell cycle-related phenotypes;
furthermore, results showed the input gene set was depleted in
development, nervous system, muscle, sensory organ and behavior
phenotypes (Supplementary File 1). We also conducted enrichment
analyses using Example 2 gene sets on GO terms and KEGG
pathways for comparisons. Signiﬁcantly enriched KEGG pathways
were not detected; however, many enriched/depleted GO terms
in Biological Process were reported (Supplementary File 2), and
notably consistent with DroPhEA output. Despite the similarity
in results, many enriched/depleted terms reported by DroPhEA
describe traits at the organismal level (e. g. sterile, viable, circadian
rhythm defective, among many others), which are not included in
GO or KEGG annotations. Therefore, mutant phenotypes are clearly
invaluable sources of complementary data to augment GO/KEGG
in bioinformatics analyses in the study of functional genomics.

4 CONCLUSION AND PERSPECTIVE

DroPhEA is an online tool used to explore insect functional
genomics through enrichment analysis of D.melan0gaster
phenotypes. Modules for enrichment analyses on phenotypes of
model organisms other than mouse and ﬂy will be added with
increased availability and improved annotations of eukaryotic
phenotypic data in the future. The backend databases of DroPhEA
are automatically updated every 2 months. The tutorial of DroPhEA
is available online at http://evol.nhri.org.tw/phenome/.

Abstract

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in gene regulation. Although it is well known
that multiple miRNAs may work as miRNA modules to synergistically regulate common target
mRNAs, the understanding of miRNA modules is still in its infancy.

Results: We employed the recently generated high throughput experimental data to study miRNA
modules. We predicted 181 miRNA modules and 306 potential miRNA modules. We observed that
the target sites of these predicted modules were in general weaker compared with those not bound
by miRNA modules. We also discovered that miRNAs in predicted modules preferred to bind
unconventional target sites rather than canonical sites. Surprisingly, contrary to a previous study,
we found that most adjacent miRNA target sites from the same miRNA modules were not within
the range of 10—130 nucleotides. Interestingly, the distance of target sites bound by miRNAs in
the same modules was shorter when miRNA modules bound unconventional instead of canonical
sites. Our study shed new light on miRNA binding and miRNA target sites, which will likely ad—
vance our understanding of miRNA regulation.

1 Introduction

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) play critical roles in gene regulation
(Bartel, 2004, 2009). MiRNAs are a family of small (~22 nucleo-
tides) non—coding RNAs. They can bind mRNAs at 5’ untranslated
regions (UTRs), coding sequences (CDSs), and 3’ UTRs. The binding
is traditionally thought to be through base—pairing of the seed
regions in miRNAs with the partially complementary sequences in
target mRNAs (Bartel, 2009). The seed region refers to the 5’ end of
miRNAs from position 2 to position 7 (Lewis et 61]., 2003, 2005).
Depending on the pairing quality, miRNA target sites are classified
into two categories: canonical sites and non—canonical sites. The for—
mer are target sites that are perfect complementary to the seed
regions, while the latter are target sites with imperfect seed comple—
mentarity (GzU wobbles or mismatches). With the advance of

biotechnology, it is accepted that base—pairing can involve both seed
regions and non—seed regions (Hafner et 61]., 2010; Helwak et 61].,
2013; Wang 2014). That is, other types of target sites eXist in
addition to the canonical and non—canonical target sites. We define
unconventional sites as target sites other than the canonical sites.
Regardless of the types of target sites, the binding of miRNAs to
their target mRNAs during diverse cellular processes may degrade
target mRNAs, and/or repress the translation of target mRNAs
to proteins (Bartel, 2004, 2009; Wang et 61]., 2011). Due to such
pivotal roles in gene regulation, it is critical to study miRNAs and
their target sites.

miRNAs often form modules to regulate target mRNAs (Doench
and Sharp, 2004; Krek et 61]., 2005; Saetrom et al., 2007; Vella
et 61]., 2004; Wu et al., 2010). In this study, a miRNA module is

defined as a group of miRNAs that co—bind a significant number of
mRNAs and repress the expression of these common mRNAs sig—
nificantly more than individual miRNAs in the module (Sections
2.2—2.3). Several studies show that miRNA modules synergistically
control the expression of their common target mRNAs (Doench and
Sharp, 2004; Krek et 61]., 2005; Saetrom et 61]., 2007; Vella et 61].,
2004; Wu et 61]., 2010). For instance, miR—124, miR—375, and let—7b
form a miRNA module that coordinately regulates the gene Mtpn in
a murine pancreatic cell line (Krek et 61]., 2005). The distance be—
tween adjacent target sites of miRNAs in the same miRNA modules
may play critical roles in target mRNA downregulation (Doench
and Sharp, 2004; Saetrom et 61]., 2007). According to multiple past
experiments, the distance of miRNA target sites for optimal
downregulation of target mRNAs is between 13 and 35 nucleotides
(Brennecke et al., 2005; Doench and Sharp, 2004; Kloosterman
et 61]., 2004; Vella et 61]., 2004). Saetrom et al. computationally
showed that miRNA target sites within 130 nucleotides are more
likely conserved than more distant sites in 3’ UTRs (Saetrom et 61].,
2007), suggesting that target sites of miRNAs may need to be within
certain ranges to be functional. Several studies also defined miRNA
modules by harnessing predicted miRNA target sites in 3’ UTRs
and the co—expression relationship of target mRNAs of the
same miRNAs (Bryan et 61]., 2013; Jayaswal et 61]., 2011; Zhang
et al., 2011).

Despite various studies mentioned above, our understanding
of miRNA modules is still rudimentary. To our knowledge, all pub—
lished large—scale studies on miRNA modules so far are based
on computationally predicted miRNA target sites in 3’ UTRs.
However, 3’ UTRs only account for a small portion of potential
miRNA target site residing regions (Hafner et 61]., 2010; Helwak
et 61]., 2013). Moreover, even the most well—known target site pre—
diction methods currently produce a significant fraction of false
positive target sites (Witkos et al., 2011). In addition, in defining
miRNA modules, few computational studies require the higher
downregulation of target gene expression by miRNA modules than
that by subsets of miRNAs contained in the modules (Wu et 61].,
2010). Therefore, although we have gained basic insight into
miRNA modules from previous studies, our understanding of
miRNA modules may be biased and limited.

In this study, we used experimentally determined instead of com—
putationally predicted target sites to study miRNA modules. We
predicted 181 miRNA modules and 306 potential miRNA modules.
We analyzed binding energy, location, and distances of target sites
in these predicted miRNA modules. We observed that target sites of
these predicted modules were in general weaker compared with tar—
get sites not bound by miRNA modules. We also discovered that
miRNAs in predicted modules preferred to bind only unconven—
tional target sites, instead of only canonical sites, or a mixture of
canonical and unconventional sites. Contrary to a previous study
(Saetrom et 61]., 2007), we noticed that most target sites of miRNAs
from the same modules were not within the range of 10—130 nucleo—
tides. Interestingly, the distance of target sites bound by miRNAs in
the same modules was shorter when miRNA modules bound uncon—
ventional instead of canonical sites. Our study sheds new light
on miRNA binding, which will likely advance our understanding
of miRNA regulation.

2 Material and methods

2.1 Target sites and gene expression data
We downloaded the experimentally determined miRNA target sites
from the crosslinking, ligation and sequencing of hybrids (CLASH)

experiments (Helwak et al., 2013). In these experiments, a miRNA
and one of its interacting mRNA target sites were ligated and
sequenced as a chimeric segment. The sequenced chimerical seg—
ments for multiple miRNAs and their target mRNAs were then sepa—
rated into segments from miRNAs and segments from their target
mRNAs, which provided the information of which miRNAs tar-
geted which region of their target mRNAs. We obtained 18514
high-confidence miRNA—mRNA interactions in HEK293 cells.
These interactions involved 399 miRNAs, 7390 mRNAs, 4130 ca—
nonical sites, 10 300 non—canonical sites and 14 384 unconventional
sites. Among these target sites, 1034 (5.6%), 11 367 (61.4%) and
6096 (32.9%) of them were within 5’ UTRs, CDSs and 3’ UTRs,
respectively. The remaining 17 target sites were not within any
annotated mRNA.

We also downloaded mRNA expression data from (Schmitter
et 61]., 2006). The expression data before and after AGOZ protein
knocking down in HEK293 were used to measure the downregula—
tion of miRNAs and miRNA modules. This was because the knock—
down of the AGOZ protein basically prevented the functions of all
miRNAs, as AGOZ is an essential component of the RNA—induced
silencing complex that recognizes target mRNAs and loads miRNAs
to target mRNAs (Bartel, 2009).

2.2 The pipeline to predict miRNA modules

We developed the following pipeline to predict miRNA modules
(Fig. 1): starting from 18 514 experimentally validated target sites,
we modified the ChIPModule approach (Ding et 61]., 2013) to dis—
cover groups of miRNAs that co—bind at least S mRNAs; next, we
applied the binomial test to assess the statistical significance of every
group of miRNAs identified above. Each significant group of
miRNAs was called a miRNA module candidate; finally, we pre—
dicted miRNA modules based on hypergeometric testing. A miRNA
module was defined as a module candidate that significantly
decreased the expression of their common mRNA targets than indi-
vidual miRNAs contained in this candidate did. The details were in

the following two sections.

2.3 Predicting miRNA module candidates

We modified ChIPModule (Ding et 61]., 2013) to discover miRNA
module candidates. ChIPModule was developed to discover signifi—
cantly co—occurring binding sites of a group of transcription factors
(TFs) in input sequences. In brief, with all known motifs in a data—
base, ChIPModule defines putative TF binding sites (TFBSs) in input
sequences. It then identifies TF groups of variable sizes with fre-
quently co—occurring TFBSs in input sequences by an effective
tree—based approach. Finally, ChIPModule assesses the statistical
significance of each TF group with frequent co—occurring TFBSs by
Poisson clumping heuristic (Hu et 61]., 2008) and output significant
TF groups as TF modules. Because of its superior performance
to other methods in TF module discovery (Ding et 61]., 2013),
we applied a modified version of ChIPModule to miRNA module
candidate discovery.

We modified ChIPModule in two aspects. One was that we
considered experimentally determined miRNA target sites instead
of putative TFBSs (Ding et al., 2013). The other was that we cal—
culated statistical significance of the co—occurrence of a group of
miRNAs differently. Assume we observed a group of k miRNAs,
all of which bound n of the 7390 mRNAs. We assessed the stat—
istical significance of this miRNA group as follows: first, for
each miRNA, we calculated its probability to have a target site
in a randomly chosen mRNA, which was the ratio of the number

of mRNAs containing the CLASH target sites of this miRNA to
7390. Second, we calculated the probability that this group of
miRNAs bound a randomly chosen mRNA by assuming each
miRNA bound the mRNA independently. That is, this probabil—
ity was measured as the product of the k probabilities that each
of the k miRNAs bound the mRNA. Finally, we calculated the
binomial tail probability of observing n of the 7390 mRNAs con—
taining target sites of all k miRNAs in this group as the statis—
tical significance of this group of miRNAs. With the tail
probabilities for all groups of miRNAs that frequently co—bind
their common mRNA targets, we applied the Q—value software
(Storey and Tibshirani, 2003) to output significant miRNA
groups so that the false discovery rate (FDR) was controlled.
The significant miRNA groups were considered as miRNA mod—
ule candidates (Fig. 1).

We applied this modified approach to output miRNA mod—
ule candidates, with S210 and FDR:0.05. S210 referred to
the requirement that all miRNAs in a module candidate shared
at least 10 common target mRNAs. We also tried S220 to pre—
dict candidates. All predicted candidates with S :20 were a subset

of the predicted candidates with S = 10, which suggested S = 20
may be too stringent. We thus reported our analyses with S = 10.

2.4 Identifying miRNA modules

Given a module candidate comprising [a miRNAs, all of which
bound the same 11 of the 7390 mRNAs, we determined whether it
was a miRNA module by the following procedure (Fig. 1). First, we
calculated a fold change extent (FCE) score for the candidate and all
its subsets with k — 1 miRNAs. The FCE score of a group of
miRNAs was defined as the fraction of their common target
mRNAs with fold changes larger than a pre—defined cutoff D, when
the expression levels of genes before and after AGOZ protein knock-
down were compared. We used three cutoffs of D, corresponding to
the 99, 95 and 90% quartile of the distribution of the fold changes
of the 7390 mRNAs. Second, we checked whether the FCE score of
this miRNA module candidate was larger than that of any subset of
size [a — 1. Third, if this candidate had larger FCE scores than any
subset, we assessed its significance of higher downregulation of tar-
get genes than the k subsets by the following hypergeometric testing.

Without loss of generality, we assumed that (i) the subset with the
largest FCE score had N common target mRNAs, among which M
mRNAs had fold changes larger than D; and (ii) the fold changes
of m out of the 11 target mRNAs of this candidate were larger than
D. Under these assumptions, the significance of observing higher
downregulation of targets of the module than that of any subset was
measured by a hypergeometric testing tail probability of observing
at least m of n targets with large fold changes randomly chosen from
the population of N targets with M targets of large fold changes.
Finally, we assigned the module type of this candidate. If the signifi—
cance at step three satisfied the required FDR of 0.05 (Storey and
Tibshirani, 2003), this candidate was claimed as a synergistic
miRNA module. Otherwise, if the FCE score of the candidate
was larger than that of any subset at step two, this candidate was a
potential synergistic miRNA module. In all remaining cases, this
candidate was considered as a non—synergistic miRNA module.
The synergistic, potential and non—synergistic miRNA modules
were abbreviated as miRNA modules, potential modules or non—
synergistic modules below, respectively.

With the above procedure, we predicted 193, 181 and 190
miRNA modules, using the 99, 95 and 90% quartile of the distribu—
tion of fold changes as D, respectively. More than 80% of the pre—
dicted miRNA modules with the three choices of D were shared
by the three sets. For convenience, we reported our results based on
the second choice of D (95%).

2.5 Validating predicted candidates especially the
predicted miRNA modules

To assess whether the predicted candidates especially the miRNA
modules were likely functional, we studied the overlap of their tar—
get genes with known pathway genes or gene sets of known func—
tions. For known pathway genes, we used pathways at http://www.
broadinstitute.org/gsea/index.jsp. To evaluate the overlap signifi-
cance, we used hypergeometric testing (Boyle et al., 2004). We also
checked the order of target sites of different miRNAs in a predicted
candidate as in previous studies (Cai et al., 2010; Ding et al., 2014).
We also searched literature to see whether a predicted module was
supported as well. For each candidate, we searched in Google
scholar to retrieve top 20 hits. For every hit, we manually checked
whether all miRNAs contained in this candidate were reported to
(i) bind the same targets; (ii) be active under the same experimental
conditions (e.g. highly co—upregulated in specific cancers); or (iii) be
found in co—transfection experiments. If at least one type of evidence
was found, this candidate was considered to be supported by
literature.

2.6 Comparing the strength of target sites

We compared the strength of target sites bound by predicted mod—
ules with that by individual miRNAs. The strength was measured by
target site binding energy downloaded from the CLASH paper
(Helwak et al., 2013). The binding energy approximated the inter-
action strength of a miRNA and one of its target sites. The higher
the energy was, the weaker the target site was. In brief, we treated
the binding energy of target sites bound by predicted miRNA mod—
ules as samples of a random variable X1. We also obtained the sam—
ples of another random variable Z, which was the binding energy of
the sites in mRNAs that were not bound by any predicted candidate.
We then applied Wilcoxon rank—sum test to test the null hypothesis
Z > X1 with the alternative hypothesis as Z <2 X1 (Wilcoxon,
1945). Similarly, we compared the strength of target sites of the po—
tential modules with that of individual miRNAs. We also compared

the strength of target sites of individual miRNAs in individual mod-
ules with the strength of target sites of the same miRNAs but not
bound by any candidate.

2.7 Analyzing the preferred target site combinations

of miRNA modules

We investigated the combinations of target sites a (potential)
miRNA module preferred to bind. We had three possible combin—
ations: all canonical sites (type 1), a mixture of canonical and
unconventional sites (type 2) and all unconventional sites (type 3).
For a (potential) miRNA module comprising [a different miRNAs,
the probability of the type 1 combination of target sites was pk,
where p is the fraction of the number of canonical sites in the 18 514
target sites. Similarly, the probability of the type 3 combination
was (1 — p)k
1 —p’< — <1 —p
ule targeting n mRNAs, m1, m2 and m3 of which had the type 1,

. The probability of the type 2 combination was
)k. We assume that we observed this (potential) mod—
type 2 and type 3 target site combinations, respectively. We calcu—
lated the significance of this (potential) module preferring the type 1
combination as the binomial tail probability of observing at least
m1 successful experiments in 11 experiments, each of which had a
success rate of Pk. Similarly, we calculated the significance of this
(potential) module preferring other types of combinations.

We analyzed five different location combinations of target sites:
all sites in CDSs (type 1), all sites in 3’ UTRs (type 2), all sites in 5’
UTRs (type 3), at least one 3’ UTR site and another site not from 3’
UTR (type 4) and all other sites (type 5). We did similar tests to
determine whether a (potential) miRNA module preferred a specific
combination of site locations.

2.8 Inferring preferred distance ranges of adjacent
target sites of miRNA modules

We defined preferred distance ranges of adjacent target sites of a
miRNA module as follows: First, we divided the distances of adja—
cent target sites of a miRNA module into 10 nucleotides long bins.
Second, we calculated the P—value of the enrichment of distances in
each bin, by assuming the distances were evenly distributed across
bins. If the P—value is small (FDR : 0.05), the bin was considered as
significantly enriched. Third, we extended each significant bin to ob—
tain a region with the smallest P—value of enrichment and defined
this region as a preferred region. More precisely, for a significant
bin, say A, we considered combining A with its left neighbouring
bin. We calculated the P—value of the enrichment of distances in
these two bins under the same uniform distribution assumption.
Similarly, we considered the two bins comprising A and its right
neighbouring bin. We then chose the extension with the smaller
P—value, for instance, the extension to the left. If this smaller P—value
is small (FDR:0.05) and smaller than the P—value of A, we ex—
tended A into a preferred region comprising two bins. We repeated
this procedure until no more extension could be made. Finally,
we reported all non—overlapping preferred regions as the preferred
distance ranges of adjacent target sites of this miRNA module.
Similarly, we defined the preferred distance ranges of adjacent target
sites of other types of candidates.

3 Results

3.1 Predicted miRNA modules were supported

by functional evidence

With FDR: 0.05 (Storey and Tibshirani, 2003), we discovered 507
miRNA module candidates (Supplementary File S1). Each candidate

consisted of 2 5 miRNAs, with an average of 2.72 miRNAs. The
number of candidates with 2, 3, 4 and 5 miRNAs was 174, 300, 32
and 1, respectively. All miRNAs in a candidate shared at least 10
common mRNA targets.

We investigated whether the 5 07 candidates significantly down—
regulated their target mRNAs more than any subset of the contained
miRNAs (Section 2). We found 181 candidates downregulated their
target mRNAs significantly more than their contained subsets
(FDR:0.05). We considered these 181 candidates miRNA mod—
ules. We also noticed that 306 candidates downregulated their target
mRNAs more than their contained subsets, with or without satisfy—
ing the required FDR of 0.05. We considered these 306 candidates
potential miRNA modules, which included the above 181 modules.
The remaining 201 candidates, which did not downregulate their
target genes more than their subsets, were defined as non—synergistic
modules.

We explored whether the 5 07 candidates, especially the 181
miRNA modules, were functional (Supplementary File S2). We
studied the overlap of target mRNAs of a candidate with genes in a
known pathway or annotated with a common gene ontology (GO)
term, as in previous studies (Ambros, 2004; Xu et al., 2011). The ra—
tionale was that if a candidate was functional, its target genes likely
significantly overlap with genes in a known pathway, or genes anno—
tated with a specific GO term (Ambros, 2004; Xu et al., 2011). We
found that the function of the majority of the predicted candidates,
especially the predicted miRNA modules, was supported (Table 1).
For instance, the target mRNAs of 68.4% of the 5 07 candidates sig—
nificantly shared at least one GO term. To assess the statistical
significance of the pathway and GO support, we generated 5 07 ran—
dom miRNA groups, each of which consisted of miRNAs randomly
chosen from the 399 miRNAs mentioned in the CLASH paper and
contained the same number of miRNAs as the corresponding pre-
dicted candidate. We found that target mRNAs of only 18 random
miRNA groups significantly overlap with genes in a pathway, and
target mRNAs of only six random miRNA groups shared a GO
term (Table 1).

In addition, we studied the order of target sites of miRNAs in the
same predicted candidates (Supplementary File S2). We found that
34.3% of the 181 miRNA modules, 33.7% of the 306 potential
modules and 29% of the 507 candidates contained miRNA pairs
with statistically significant orders (Table 1, FDR:0.05). For in-
stance, three miRNAs MIR-222, LET-7B and MIR-615-3P formed
a miRNA module. MIR—615—3P preferred to bind at the 5’ of the
target sites of MIR—222 (FDR : 0.0286), which preferred to bind at
the 5’ of the target sites of LET—7B (FDR: 6.1E—4). In contrast, no
random miRNA group had preferred orders.

We also did a literature search to check whether the predicted
candidates were supported (Supplementary File S2). We found that
99 of the 5 07 candidates and 32 of the 181 miRNA modules were
supported by literature (Table 1). By comparison, we did literature
search for the 5 07 random miRNA groups and found that 1 1 groups

were supported. The supporting rate of 11/100 was likely over-
estimated, as the 399 miRNAs were known to be active under the
same conditions and may actually play certain roles together.
Even given the over—estimated supporting rate of random miRNA
combinations, the chance of observing the number of supported
candidates was 0 (Table 1).

3.2 Target sites of miRNA modules were weaker
compared with other target sites

We compared the strength of target sites bound by predicted (poten—
tial) miRNA modules with that by individual miRNAs. Target sites
of the predicted miRNA modules had significantly higher energy
than target sites bound by individual miRNAs (Wilcoxon rank-sum
P—value 3.0 E —19). Similarly, this was true for target sites of the po—
tential miRNA modules (P—value 4.6 E —15). Target sites of (poten—
tial) miRNA modules were thus weaker than target sites not bound
by any of the 5 07candidates.

We also compared the strength of target sites of the predicted
modules and the potential modules with that of non—synergistic
modules. Target sites of the 181 miRNA modules had significantly
higher energy than target sites bound by the 201 non—synergistic
modules (P—value 1.6 E —56). Similarly, target sites of the 306 po—
tential modules had significantly higher energy than those bound by
the 201 non—synergistic modules (P—value 1.7 E —87).Therefore, tar—
get sites of the (potential) miRNA modules were weaker than those
of the 201 non-synergistic modules, which implied that there was a
difference between candidates that downregulated target mRNAs
more than their subsets and candidates that did not.

We further compared the strength of target sites of individual
miRNAs bound by (potential) miRNA modules with that of target
sites of the same miRNAs not bound by any of the 5 07 candidates.
For 42 of the 56 miRNAs in the 181 miRNA modules, their target
sites were significantly weaker compared with their target sites not
bound by any of the 5 07 candidates (FDR : 0.05). On the contrary,
for only 4 of the 56 miRNAs, their target sites were significantly
stronger than those not bound by any candidate (FDR : 0.05), sug—
gesting that for the majority of miRNAs, target sites bound by mod—
ules were not as strong as target sites not bound by any candidate.
A similar observation was made for the 306 potential modules, for
which target sites of 51 of the 68 miRNAs bound by modules were
weaker and target sites of only 7 of the 68 miRNAs bound by mod—
ules were stronger (FDR : 0.05). Therefore, consistent with the
above pooled analyses of target sites of all (potential) modules, tar—
get sites of the majority of miRNAs bound by individual (potential)
modules were weaker (Figure 2).

3.3 Most miRNA modules preferred to bind
unconventional target sites

We investigated the preferred combinations of canonical and uncon—

miRNA modules, 99, 5 and 6 miRNA modules preferred target sites
composed of all unconventional sites (type 1), a mixture of canon-
ical and unconventional sites (type 2) and all canonical sites (type
3), respectively (FDR: 0.05). Similarly, for the 306 potential
miRNA modules, 169, 12 and 10 potential miRNA modules pre—
ferred target sites of types 1, 2 and 3, respectively (FDR:0.05).
It was thus evident that more than half of the (potential) miRNA
modules preferred to bind unconventional sites instead of a mixture
of canonical and unconventional sites.

The above analyses only showed that most (potential) miRNA
modules preferred to bind mRNAs containing only unconventional
sites. It was not clear whether target sites in the majority of mRNA
targets of a (potential) miRNA module were composed of only un—
conventional sites. We thus checked the (potential) miRNA modules
which had more than 70% of mRNA targets that contained only un—
conventional sites. We found that 116 of the 181 (64.1%) miRNA
modules had more than 70% of their mRNA targets with only un-
conventional sites, and 198 of the 306 (64.7%) potential miRNA
modules had more than 70% of mRNA targets with only unconven—
tional sites. Therefore, the combination of all unconventional target
sites was the most dominant combination found in target mRNAs
of most (potential) miRNA modules.

Since unconventional sites included non—canonical sites and
other sites, we explored whether miRNA modules prefer to bind
non—canonical sites. For the 181 significant modules, only 52
(28.7%) modules significantly preferred all non—canonical sites.
Moreover, only four modules had more than 70% of mRNA target
with only non—canonical sites. Similarly, for 306 potential synergis—
tic modules, only 82 (26.8%) modules significantly preferred all
non—canonical sites. Only five modules had more than 70% of
mRNA target with only non—canonical sites. It was thus evident
that miRNA modules preferred unconventional sites instead of non—
canonical unconventional sites (Figure 2).

3.4 Most miRNA modules preferred to bind the first

or the last exons

We studied the location combinations of target sites of (potential)
miRNA modules (Section 2). We found that most (potential)
miRNA modules preferred to bind target sites in CDSs instead of a
mixture of CDSs and UTRs. For the 181 miRNA modules, 127, 7, 2
and 2 miRNA modules preferred target sites all in CDSs (type 1), all
in 3’ UTRs (type 2), all in 5’ UTRs (type 3), and in both 3’ UTRs and
other locations (type 4), respectively (FDR : 0.05 ). Similarly, for the

306 potential miRNA modules, 210, 16, 3 and 2 potential miRNA
modules preferred target sites of types 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.
In contrast, 1, 0, 0 and 0 of the 5 07 random miRNA groups
preferred target sites of types 1, 2, 3 and 4, respectively.

Because the majority of (potential) miRNA modules preferred to
bind only in CDSs, we further investigated whether target sites in an
mRNA target of a (potential) module were always in the same
exons, adjacent exons or others. We found that the majority of the
(potential) miRNA modules prefer to bind the same exons. For in—
stance, for 150 of the 181 miRNA modules, more than 50% of their
target sites in a target mRNA were in the same exon. Similarly, for
256 of the 306 potential modules, more than 50% of their target
sites in a target mRNA were in the same exon. In contrast, the 5 07
random miRNA groups did not have exon binding preference, of
which only 14 random miRNA groups had more than 5 0% of their
target sites in the same exon in an mRNA.

Since most target sites in a target mRNA of a (potential) module
were in the same exon, we also studied whether the target sites of a
(potential) module preferred a specific type of exons. Indeed, we
found that the first and the last exon of the target mRNAs were pre—
ferred to be bound by the (potential) miRNA modules. For instance,
64.9% of target sites of the 181 miRNA modules that were in the
same exons were in either the first exons or the last exons. Similarly,
67.3% of target sites of the 306 potential miRNA modules that
were in the same exons were in either the first exons or the last
exons. Therefore, we concluded that most (potential) miRNA mod—
ules preferred to bind one exon in the target mRNAs, either the first
or the last exons.

3.5 miRNA modules preferred target sites within

certain ranges

With the experimentally determined target sites, we studied the pre—
ferred distance range of the adjacent target sites of miRNA modules.
We defined the preferred distance ranges of target sites of the 181
miRNA modules, 306 potential miRNA modules, 202 non—synergis—
tic modules and the 507 module candidates, respectively (Table 2
and Supplementary File S3). For each of the four types of miRNA
combinations, more than 70% of combinations had preferred dis—
tance ranges. The distribution of the preferred distance ranges of the
181 miRNA modules and that of the 306 potential modules were
more similar to each other, compared with that of the 202 non—
synergistic modules (Figure 3). For all four types of miRNA
combinations with preferred distance ranges, more than 90% of

combinations in each type had all preferred distance ranges <360
nucleotides (Figure 3 and Table 2). In contrast, 20 (3.9%) of the
507 random miRNA groups had preferred distance ranges, 10
(50.0%) of which had preferred distance ranges <360 nucleotides.

We tested whether two previously known preferred ranges,
10—130 nucleotides and 13—35 nucleotides, were enriched. For 44
(24.3%) miRNA modules, 90 (29.4%) potential miRNA modules
and 69 (34.3%) non—synergistic modules, the 10—130 range was en—
riched (Binomial test, FDR : 0.05). For 17 (9.4%) miRNA modules,
32 (10.5%) potential miRNA modules and 16 (8.0%) non—synergis—
tic modules, the 13—35 range was enriched (Binomial test,
FDR:0.05). If we pooled the distances of target sites of all 181
miRNA modules together, the 10—130 and 13—35 ranges were en—
riched (P—value:0 in both cases). Similarly, the two ranges were
enriched in distances of target sites of the potential modules, the
non—synergistic modules and the 5 07 module candidates.

Although the two ranges of distances were enriched, the majority
of distances of adjacent target sites of modules or module candidates

were not within the two ranges (Table 2). For instance, in the 181
miRNA modules, more than 74.1% of distances of adjacent target
sites of miRNA modules were longer than 130 nucleotides.
Moreover, 85 (47.0%) miRNA modules had preferred distance
ranges larger than 130 nucleotides (Table 2 and Figure 3). Future
work may need to investigate how miRNAs with target sites in such
large distance ranges interact.

3.6 Adjacent unconventional target sites of miRNA
modules preferred shorter distances than other

types of adjacent target sites

We studied the difference between the distances of adjacent uncon—
ventional target sites of a module and those of other types of adja—
cent target sites of the same module. For every predicted miRNA
module, we collected the distances of adjacent unconventional target
sites in each target mRNA. That is, we only considered target
mRNAs that contained only unconventional sites of this module.
We also collected distances of other target sites of this module. For
150 of the 181 miRNA modules, we had at least five distances col—
lected for each of the two types of distances. We tested the null hy—
pothesis that the distances of adjacent unconventional sites were
shorter than those of other types. We only rejected the null hypoth—
esis in five cases based on Wilcoxon rank—sum test (FDR:0.05).
We further tested the null hypothesis that the distances of adjacent
unconventional sites were longer than those of other types. We re—
jected the null hypothesis in 31 cases (FDR: 0.05). We concluded
that in six times more cases, the distances of adjacent unconven—
tional target sites seemed shorter than that of other types of adjacent
target sites.

The sample size may be too small for the above analyses using
individual miRNA modules. Therefore, we considered distances
of adjacent unconventional sites of all miRNA modules together in-
stead of individual miRNA modules. For the null hypothesis that the
distances of adjacent unconventional sites were shorter than those
of other types, we accepted the null hypothesis (P—value > 0.99). For
the null hypothesis that the distances of adjacent unconventional
sites were longer than those of other types, we rejected the null hy—
pothesis (P—value:9.7 E —14). This pooled analysis showed that
the distances of adjacent unconventional sites were indeed shorter.

We also did similar analyses for the 306 potential modules.
We obtained similar results. That is, for the analysis based on indi—
vidual potential modules, in three times more cases (41 vs. 12), the
distances of adjacent unconventional sites were shorter than the dis—
tances of other types of sites. In the pooled analysis, for the null
hypothesis that the distances of adjacent unconventional sites were
shorter than those of other types, we accepted the null hypothesis
(P-value > 0.99). For the null hypothesis that the distances of

adjacent unconventional sites were longer than those of other types,
we rejected the null hypothesis (P—value : 5.0 E — 16). Therefore, it
was evident that adjacent unconventional target sites preferred
shorter distances than other types of adjacent target sites.

4 Discussion

We studied miRNA modules based on experimentally determined
miRNA target sites. We predicted 181 miRNA modules and 306 po—
tential miRNA modules. We demonstrated that miRNA modules
preferred to bind weak sites and favoured a combination of all un—
conventional sites. We also observed that miRNA modules preferred
to bind in CDSs and favoured the first and the last exons. We con—
firmed that more than 70% of miRNA modules bound sites within
specific ranges, with enrichment in two previously known ranges.
However, many more adjacent sites bound by miRNA modules
were >130 nucleotides apart. We further showed that unconven—
tional target sites of miRNA modules were often within shorter dis—
tances than other combinations of target sites. Our study shed new
light on miRNA binding.

The majority of adjacent target sites of miRNA modules were
>130 nucleotides apart, which contradicted with previous observa—
tions (Brennecke et al., 2005 ; Doench and Sharp, 2004;
Kloosterman et al., 2004; Saetrom et al., 2007; Vella et al., 2004).
To understand what resulted in different observations, we focused
on target sites of the 181 miRNA modules in 3’ UTRs. We found
even when we considered only target sites in 3’ UTRs, more than
75% of adjacent target sites of miRNA modules were >130 nucleo—
tides apart. We also predicted miRNA module candidates using only
the 6096 CLASH target sites in 3’ UTRs and then studied the dis—
tances of adjacent target sites of these candidates. We still observed
that the majority of adjacent target sites of these candidates were
>130 nucleotides apart (Supplementary File S4). Therefore, the dif-
ferent observations were unlikely because we used target sites in en—
tire mRNA regions while previous studies used only target sites in 3’
UTRs. Instead, it may be due to the small number of experimentally
determined sites in previous experimental studies and the limited
quality of predicted sites in the previous computational study, com—
pared with the 18 514 high—quality experimentally determined sites
we used.

We predicted (potential) miRNA modules on the condition that
they downregulated target genes significantly more than some of
their miRNA subsets. We further checked whether these (potential)
modules downregulated their target genes significantly more than
any subset contained in the modules. We confirmed that for all
(potential) miRNA modules, their target genes were significantly
more down—regulated than the target genes of any of their subsets.

We discovered 201 non—synergistic modules. The non—synergistic
modules may also play important roles in regulating target genes,
as supported by GO and pathway analyses, order preference, and
the literature. Moreover, these non—synergistic modules may be com—
petitive miRNA modules that are worth further investigation
(Khan et al., 2009).

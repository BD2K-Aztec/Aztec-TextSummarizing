ABSTRACT

Motivation: With the expansion of high-throughput technologies,
understanding different kinds of genome-level data is a common
task. MicroRNA (miRNA) is increasingly profiled using high-throughput
technologies (microarrays or next-generation sequencing). The down-
stream analysis of miRNA targets can be difficult. Although there are
many databases and algorithms to predict miRNA targets, there are
few tools to integrate miRNA—gene interaction data into high-through-
put genomic analyses.

Results: We present targetHub, a CouchDB database of miRNA—gene
interactions. TargetHub provides a programmer-friendly interface to
access miRNA targets. The Web site provides RESTful access to
miRNA—gene interactions with an assortment of gene and miRNA
identifiers. It can be a useful tool to integrate miRNA target interaction
data directly into high-throughput bioinformatics analyses.
Availability: TargetHub is available on the web at http://app1.bioinfor
matics.mdanderson.org/tarhub/_design/basic/index.html.

1 INTRODUCTION

Understanding genome-level data is a recurring task in molecular
biology research, made more challenging with the development
of numerous high-throughput technologies. One interesting
aspect of genome biology involves microRNAs (miRNAs),
which are gaining signiﬁcant attention for their regulatory roles
in human pathologies (Mendell and Olson, 2012). miRNAs are
frequently proﬁled using high-throughput technologies, such as
microarrays or next-generation sequencing (Li and Ruan, 2009;
Ryu et al., 2011). The downstream analysis of miRNA data
generated from such massive platforms needs efﬁcient bioinfor-
matics methods.

miRNAs regulate the expression of protein-coding genes by
inhibiting translation and, in some cases, by cleaving the asso-
ciated messenger RNA (mRNA) (Bartel, 2004). Many computa-
tional methods predict such regulation based on sequence
features, such as complementarity and free energy, of miRNA,
mRNA and their duplex (Thomas et al., 2010). Potential miRNA
targets are often identiﬁed by seeking agreement among multiple
prediction methods for a particular interaction. Currently,
several databases, including TarBase (Vergoulis et al., 2012),
miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009), miRGator (Cho et al., 2011)

and miRGen (Alexiou et al., 2010), contain miRNA target pre-
dictions from multiple methods. The Web sites of these databases
provide graphical interfaces to manually access and search the
data. However, for a complete miRNA high-throughput ana-
lysis, it is currently necessary to download the complete database
of target information and write customized scripts to parse the
data, as there is no support for programmatic access to subsets of
the miRNA—gene interaction data.

Here we present targetHub, a new programmer-friendly data-
base of miRNA—gene interactions. TargetHub is a schema-free
database that can be accessed as a web service from any modern
programming language using a simple HyperText Transfer
Protocol (HTTP) call. This interface supports automatic integra-
tion of miRNA target information into high-throughput miRNA
data analyses. The targetHub Web site can also be used to manu-
ally access and search the miRNA—gene interactions with
miRNA identiﬁers and an assortment of gene identiﬁers powered
by geneSmash (Manyam et al., 2012).

2 APPLICATION INFORMATION
2.1 Data description

TargetHub currently contains miRNA—gene interactions pre-
dicted by TargetScan (Grimson et al., 2007), PicTar (Krek
et al., 2005) and miRanda (Enright et al., 2003). TargetHub
also includes experimentally validated interactions from
miRTarBase (Hsu et al., 2011). Human miRNA data were
obtained from miRBase (version 18) (Grifﬁths-Jones, 2004).
3’ Un-Translated Region (UTR) sequence data of the human
genome (hgl9) were extracted from the UCSC Table Brower
(Karolchik et al., 2004).

Interactions predicted by TargetScan (v6.1) were obtained
from their portal (www.targetscan.org). PicTar interaction data
were acquired from the UCSC Table Browser (hgl7). The
source code of miRanda (version 3.3a) was obtained from their
Web site (cbio.mskcc.org/microrna_data/manual.html) and used
to compute miRNA targets for version 18 of miRBase using
strict mode and the default cutoff score (140). The human
miRTarBase data (r2.5) were downloaded from their portal (mir-
tarbase.mbc.nctu.edu.tw). Because the nomenclature for miRNA
is not completely standard across these sources, miRNA names
are represented in targetHub using the following conventions.
miRNA that match version 18 of miRBase are retained
unchanged; candidates that have no matching identiﬁer are
curated by mapping through identiﬁers of previous miRBase
versions.

2.2 Implementation details

TargetHub is built using CouchDB, an Apache open-source data-
base platform. CouchDB is a document-oriented and schema-
free database system with a built-in web server. Database queries
are processed through HTTP requests, which are handled by a
RESTful JavaScript Object Notation (JSON) application pro-
gramming interface (API) (Lennon, 2010). CouchDB provides
native support for incremental database replication. Thus, users
of targetHub can easily maintain a local copy with automatic
updates.

The standard data document in targetHub represents an inter-
action between one miRNA and one gene, along with the evi-
dence used to predict the interaction. Because query responses
are pre—computed for each document, the data access rate is fast.
miRNA—gene interactions predicted by other methods can easily
be incorporated into targetHub, as the design/schema is ﬂexible.
The database design and source code can be freely accessed from
the design document of the targetHub database.

The Web site is developed using HyperText Markup Language
(HTML) and JavaScript to build on the CouchDB J SON API.
The search interface relies on geneSmash, a gene-centric
CouchDB database (Manyam et al., 2012). The geneSmash
web service converts any input gene identiﬁer into the corres-
ponding Entrez Gene identiﬁer. The Entrez Gene identiﬁer is
forwarded to targetHub to retrieve the relevant miRNA—gene
interaction data. Targets predicted by various methods are illu-
strated by a Venn diagram after searching the Web site using any
criteria (Fig. l).

The database can be accessed as a web service with an API or
through the Web site. The API is described on the Web site.
Sample code to access targetHub through perl and R is provided
in the documentation. User can query the database with various
identiﬁers (by either gene or miRNA) in two different search
modes. Search can be performed either with aggregate number
of methods supporting the interaction or by speciﬁc methods
used to derive the miRNA—gene interaction.

3 CONCLUSION

TargetHub offers a Web site and web service to access miRNA—
gene interactions. It is a RESTful database with a programmer-
friendly interface through the API. Maintaining a local copy of
targetHub is hassle-free, due to the built-in support for replica-
tion. In summary, targetHub can be a useful tool to integrate
miRNA target information into high-throughput genomic
analyses.

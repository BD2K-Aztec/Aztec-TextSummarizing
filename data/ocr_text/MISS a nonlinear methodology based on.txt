ABSTRACT

Motivation: Finding association between genetic variants and
phenotypes related to disease has become an important vehicle
for the study of complex disorders. In this context, multi-loci
genetic association might unravel additional information when
compared with single loci search. The main goal of this work is to
propose a non-linear methodology based on information theory for
finding combinatorial association between multi-SNPs and a given
phenotype.

Results: The proposed methodology, called MISS (mutual
information statistical significance), has been integrated jointly with
a feature selection algorithm and has been tested on a synthetic
dataset with a controlled phenotype and in the particular case of
the F7 gene. The MISS methodology has been contrasted with a
multiple linear regression (MLR) method used for genetic association
in both, a population-based study and a sib-pairs analysis and with
the maximum entropy conditional probability modelling (MECPM)
method, which searches for predictive multi-locus interactions.
Several sets of SNPs within the F7 gene region have been found
to show a significant correlation with the FVII levels in blood. The
proposed multi-site approach unveils combinations of SNPs that
explain more significant information of the phenotype than their
individual polymorphisms. MISS is able to find more correlations
between SNPs and the phenotype than MLR and MECPM. Most of
the marked SNPs appear in the literature as functional variants with
real effect on the protein FVII levels in blood.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the main challenges of current genetic research is to
study the association between genotypes and phenotypes and, in

particular, to identify genetic factors responsible for the heritability
of complex traits. The two principal strategies for ﬁnding genetic
variants related to diseases are linkage analysis and association
studies (Emahazion et al., 2001). Linkage occurs when multiple
loci are physically related and are inherited together jointly with
the disease. Linkage analyses take proﬁt of this effect through
measuring the cosegregation of the polymorphisms and a phenotype
through a family or set of families. Genetic association looks for
correlations between two investigated factors, typically a DNA
sequence variability (a genotype) and a trait (a phenotype). In
the last decades, technological advances in human genetics have
allowed association studies to work with large numbers of genetic
markers. Association studies may be affected by the structure or
homogeneity of the population under study. In particular, common
genetic information between relatives may introduce a bias in the
data. The main goal of family studies is to explore this dependence
in order to extract additional information. One of the ﬁrst approaches
for family association studies was the analysis of sib—pairs that
present more homogeneity of age and environment than other pairs
of relatives and are relatively easy to ascertain (Kruglyak and
Lander, 1995). However, these methods have been extended to small
pedigree (nuclear families) analysis and later on to extended families
(Bishop and Williamson, 1990).

The genetic variability represents around 1% of the DNA
sequence (Feuk et al., 2006). The genetic variants are responsible
for differences between individuals such as physical appearance,
susceptibility to disease or response to medical treatments.
Among the different types of genetic variants, single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) are the most common type of genetic
variation used for the study of genetic diseases (Mooney, 2005;
Su, 2007). SNPs are deﬁned as single nucleotide positions in the
genome where there is a mutation (i.e. the substitution of one base
by another), which is observed in > 1% of the population (Brookes,
1999). It is assumed that at most one mutation could have occurred
at a given locus in the short human evolution (Sarkis et al., 2007).
Consequently, only two of the four common nucleotides may be
found in a given SNP position, the ancestral one (A1) and the mutated
one (A2).

Some variations in the DNA may be responsible for the
development of diseases. Traditional genetic techniques have

facilitated the identiﬁcation of several hundred human genes where
there are mutations that lead to a Mendelian disease. However,
they are not always useful for studying diseases that depend on
the interaction of many gene sequences and the environment. These
are known as complex diseases, such as Alzheimer disease or most
cardiovascular diseases. For such diseases, multi—loci analysis is
expected to be more powerful than the traditional locus—by—locus
SNP association studies (Brinza et al., 2006), detecting even more
interactions. Moreover, complex diseases generally involve greater
difﬁculties in phenotype deﬁnition. The genetic heterogeneity is
often closely associated with ‘intermediate’ phenotypes (Souto,
2003). An intermediate phenotype is a biological and measurable
variable that index some aspects of disease risk and susceptibility,
such as weight or some protein levels in blood.

Traditional statistical methods are not always useful for the
detection of the multiple and combinatorial interactions that come
into play in complex diseases. Therefore, the development of
computational and statistical methods for detecting combinations of
multiple SNPs is of clinical interest. These methods can be split in
two basic aspects: the relevance criterion that determines how well a
set of SNPs represents the observed variability in the phenotype and
the search method used in the selection algorithm (Halldorsson et al.,
2004). As many other ﬁelds in bioinformatics, genetic association
and linkage studies require to use techniques from other engineering
sciences. Genetic association can be approached from a pattern
recognition point of View. Actually, ﬁnding association between
genetic variants and a phenotype can be seen as a feature selection
(FS) procedure, in the sense of selecting genetic variants with a
relevance criterion of association with the phenotype.

The optimal solution to the FS problem requires searching all
the possible combinations of features, which is computationally
unfeasible (Jain and Zongker, 1997). Thus, FS methods are known
to be suboptimal. FS algorithms can be classiﬁed depending on
their search organization that can be sequential or random (Molina
et al., 2002). Sequential algorithms are the most commonly used.
Simple sequential algorithms are based on adding or removing
features to the selection set by using forward and backward steps,
respectively. The most common variants are called sequential
forward selection (SFS) and sequential backward selection (SBS).
This strategy does not take into account the correlations between
features and may produce the effect of ﬁnding redundant sets of
features. In order to avoid this problem, algorithms that combine
forward and backward steps have been proposed. Plus r - take
away l algorithm combines r SFS and l SBS. Floating variants
were introduced [sequential forward ﬂoating selection (SFFS) and
sequential backward ﬂoating selection (SBFS)] in order to combine
forward and backward steps dynamically (Somol et al., 1999). On
the other hand, the search organization may also be driven by a
random factor such as in genetic algorithms (GAs) or random search
(Shah and Kusiak, 2004). In the last decades, the motivation of
using FS in bioinformatics has grown, not only for association but
also in other contexts (Saeys et al., 2007). In the domain of SNP
analysis, FS has been used for tag SNP selection using linkage
disequilibrium (LD) measures (Carlson et al., 2004), multiple linear
regression (MLR; He and Zelikovsky, 2006) or sequential search
(Dawy, 2006).

The main characteristic of FS algorithms is the relevance criterion
that decides if a set of features (SNPs) is signiﬁcantly representative
of the observed variable (the phenotype). This criterion is based on

measuring the dependencies between the features and the dependent
variable, generally using a similarity measure. Most of the similarity
measures are linear. The most commonly used are the linear
correlation measures, such as the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient.
LD measures (D’ and r2) can also be expressed as a linear correlation
measure (Zaykin et al., 2008). Other methods for measuring the
linear dependencies between variables are based on multi—linear
regression MLR models (He and Zelikovsky, 2006) or the Student’s
t statistical test and subsequently the Fisher’s F statistical test (Zhou
and Wang, 2007). MLR—based models are the most commonly used
method for measuring the linear dependencies between SNPs and
phenotypes in the context of genetic association studies. However,
these dependencies may not be only linear so that non—linear
similarity measures may be appropriate as a relevance criterion
of the FS algorithm (Cheng et al., 2007), such as support vector
machines (SVMs), neural networks (NNs) and other classiﬁers from
the machine learning ﬁeld as found in Miller et al. (2009), who has
proposed a search algorithm using maximum entropy conditional
probability modelling (MECPM) or other proposals employing a
boosting classiﬁer based in CARTs (Wan et al., 2009).

Measures from information theory (IT) take into account both
linear and non—linear correlations between variables. The basic
measure of IT is the entropy, which is an uncertainty measure. The
mutual information (MI) is a similarity measure from IT, which
do not require a mathematical representation of the genetic space.
IT has been applied in several ﬁelds in bioinformatics (Schneider
and Stephens, 1990). In the domain of SNP analysis, a sequential
search algorithm based on MI has already been proposed in a genetic
association context (Dawy, 2006). Zhang et al. (2009) propose a
multi—loci LD measure based on MI for haplotype tagging SNPs
selection.

This article is focused on a gene involved in the coagulation
cascade. Cardiovascular diseases represent the major cause of death
in the world population (Mackay and Mensah, 2004). In particular,
ischaemia and venous or arterial thromboses are produced by a blood
clot or an obstruction that blocks the blood circulation in a vein
or an artery. During the coagulation process, a set of proteins in
the blood plasma respond in cascade to form ﬁbrin clots. These
proteins are referred to as coagulation factors. Levels of coagulation
factors in blood represent a set of intermediate phenotypes that may
be a good starting point for identifying genes involved in disease
risk for thromboses and ischaemia. It has been demonstrated that
some of the coagulation factors have a genetic compound and show
signiﬁcant hereditability (Souto et al., 2000). For example, Factor V
Leiden is a variant of factor V produced by a mutation on the gene
that codes this protein (F5). Factor V Leiden is the most common
hereditary disorder of the coagulation process (Stefano et al., 1998).
It has also been published that coagulation Factor VII (FVII) has a
genetic effect on disorders of haemostasis (Soria et al., 2005). The
genetic variability in F7 gene is the most responsible for observed
phenotypic variations in FVII levels.

The main goal of this work is to propose a non—linear method
based on IT for ﬁnding association between genetic variants (SNPs)
and intermediate phenotypes involved in complex diseases and
more particularly in thrombosis. This methodology is applied for
ﬁnding association between multiple sites in the F7 gene and
the corresponding intermediate phenotype, factor FVII levels. The
proposed method is compared with linear methods for genetic
association based on MLR and with a non—linear approach MECPM.

A nonlinear methodology based on mutual information for genetic association studies

 

Results obtained in a population—based study are compared with
those obtained in a sib—pairs analysis.

2 METHODS
2.1 Datasets

This study has been developed with three datasets Two of them correspond
to real datasets of SNPs of the F7 gene whereas the third one is synthetic.

Coagulation factor VII (FVII) is a vitamin K —dependent protein that
plays an important role at the top of the coagulation cascade. The GAIT
(Genetic Analysis of Idiopathic Thrombophilia) project is a family—based
study of the genetics of thrombosis in the Spanish population (Soria et al.,
2005; Souto et al., 2000). In this project, it has been proven that the
genetic variability in the F7 gene is the major responsible for factor FVII—
level variations. The F7 gene is located at the segment 13q34, on the
chromosome 13 of the human genome. It is about 13 000 bases long among
which around 50 polymorphisms have been identiﬁed. The GAIT study is
composed of 398 individuals of 21 extended families, 12 of them affected
of thrombophilia. For each individual, the symbolic measures of the SNPs
(A1A1,A1A2 or A2A2) of the F7 gene are available, as well as the quantitative
measures of the phenotype (FVII levels in blood).

On one hand, a population—based study has been performed with 93
independent individuals, selected from the GAIT database. These individuals
are called founders and they do not share genetic information from common
ancestors. The phenotypes have been discretized using a direct plug—in
approach, where kernel functionals are used to estimate the optimal binwidth
and bandwidths (Wand, 1996). In this case, the factor FVII levels in blood
have been discretized into eight categories.

On the other hand, a sib—pairs analysis has been developed with 345
pairs of sibs, selected from the GAIT database. Generally, family studies
are based on comparing the genotypic information of two individuals within
the same family. The ﬁrst approach was to establish a genotypic distance by
determining if two individuals share 0, 1 or 2 alleles identical—by—descent
(IBD) at a given position (Kruglyak and Lander, 1995). Two alleles are IBD,
if one is a copy of the other or if both of them are copies of the same ancestral
(Weeks and Lange, 1992). In practice, it is not always possible to estimate
the number of alleles shared IBD at a given position because the allelic
measurements of the ancestors are not always available. Identity—by—state
(IBS) methods also estimate the genotypic differences between sib—pairs.
Two alleles are IBS if there are the same allele, regardless of their ancestral
origin. The IBS methodology estimates a probability distribution of sharing
0, 1 or 2 alleles IBS by looking at the allelic frequencies (Bishop and
Williamson, 1990). For avoiding the computing of these probabilities, the
genotypic distance is established directly from the number of alleles shared
IBS, as follows. The distance between two identical homozygous genotypes
(e.g. A1A1 and A1A1) is d =0. The distance between an homozygous and an
heterozygous genotype (e. g. A1A1 and A1A2) is d = 1. The distance between
two opposite homozygous genotypes (e.g. A1A1 and A2A2) is d=2. For
quantitative traits, the number of alleles IBS that two sibs share should
present a correlation with the difference of their phenotypes. Thus, the
genotypic distance, computed for each sib—pair and each SNP of the F7 gene,
is compared with the phenotypic distance which is the difference between
the FVII levels of each individual. The variable of phenotypic differences
has been discretized with the methodology described in Wand (1996) in
16 categories.

A synthetic dataset has been built in order to compare and evaluate the
behaviour of the algorithm in detecting interactions of SNPs in a closed
environment. First, two unrelated SNPs of the F7 gene have been selected
(rs491098 and rs36208414). A phenotype has been synthetically generated
from the information of these SNPs through an epistatic multiplicative
model (Lynch and Walsh, 1998). The dataset is completed by random SNPs
generated by surrogating the remaining SNPs of the F7 gene. The surrogate
technique destroys the individual order in the SNPs, which guarantees

randomness. The knowledge of this dataset allows to ascertain if a given
methodology is able to detect the correlation between the interaction of
the two selected SNPs and the phenotype, without assuming the intrinsic
properties of the F7 gene.

2.2 Linear method

The reference linear method chosen for selecting SNPs correlated with
the phenotype is a MLR model (He and Zelikovsky, 2006). MLR tries to
ﬁt a model that represents the linear relations existing between a set of
independent variables S 2 {S}, where S,- are SNPs, and an observed variable,
the phenotype f as in ( 1).

f=ﬁo+ﬁ1~Sl+m+IBn-Sn+e (1)

where 6,- are the regression coefﬁcients and e is the error of the model.
The method estimates the values of 6,- that minimize 6. Each coefﬁcient (8))
represents the individual contribution of a SNP (S,) for the prediction off.

2.2.] Correlation of one SNP against the phenotype The correlation of
each SNP S,- against the phenotype f is represented by the regression
coefﬁcient 6,. The statistical signiﬁcance of this correlation is determined
by a Student’s t statistical test. The null hypothesis supposes the nullity of
the corresponding regression coefﬁcient (6,- = 0). Given a set of SNPs S and
a SNP S), the Student’s t—test over the regression coefﬁcient 6,- is used to
determine if S), individually, adds information about the phenotype f with
respect to S. The signiﬁcance of the correlation of the total set S+(S,-) is
described in the next section.

2.2.2 Correlation of a set of SNPs against the phenotype A Fisher
hypothesis test (F —test) is applied to determine if the total set of SNPs is
signiﬁcantly correlated with the phenotype. In this case, the null hypothesis
supposes the nullity of the slope of the regression line, i.e. all the regression
coefﬁcients at the same time, ({ﬁi}=0). The resulting P—value is used to
determine if the SNPs (Si), jointly, have a signiﬁcant predictive linear
capacity over the phenotype f. Once a SNP S,- is added to the selection
set S, the F —test is used to determine if the total set S+{S,-} is signiﬁcantly
linearly correlated with the phenotype f.

2.3 Non-linear method

One of the greatest advantages of the MI is that it measures both
linear and non—linear correlations between variables. Moreover, MI can be
computed directly from the symbol frequencies without a previous numerical
representation of genetic data, which involves a loss of information. The M1
between a SNP or a set of SNPs S and a phenotype f is deﬁned in (2).

p(Sf)
I S; = E E S, l

=H(S)+HOC)—H(Saf) (2)

 

where p(S) and p0“) are the probability distribution functions of S and f,
respectively, and p(S,F) is the joint probability distribution function for S
and f. H (S) and H 0“ ) represent the entropies of S and f, respectively, and
H (S, f ) is the joint entropy of S and f (Shannon, 1948).

The M1 is symmetric and non—negative measure. I (S , f ) =0 yields if and
only if the two variables are statistically independent and there are no ﬁnite
sample effects.

2.3.] Finite sample size eﬁ‘ects Information theoretic measures are biased
by ﬁnite sample size effects. When the sample size is ﬁnite, the MI value is
larger than the real information value (3).

I(S;f)>0. (3)

The main effect of the ﬁnite sample size in this methodology is that given
a set of SNPs S, any other SNP Si, even a random SNP, will add information

about the phenotype to the set (4).
1(S+Si;f)ZI(Saf) (4)

Thus, a statistical hypothesis test is necessary to discriminate SNPs and
to know if the gain of information about the phenotype is not only due to
the ﬁnite sample size problem. This test compares the MI of a SNP against
the phenotype with a null distribution of MI. The resulting P—value helps
to decide if the SNP shares a signiﬁcant amount of information with the
phenotype. The null distribution of MI has to show the behaviour of the MI
in random cases.

The null distribution of the MI depends on the size of the sample, the
degrees of freedom of each particular SNP and the degrees of freedom of
the phenotype (Dawy, 2006). A ﬁrst approach to obtain the null distribution
is to generate n random copies of the SNP under study. The resulting MI
null distribution is a vector of the corresponding n MI values. The P—value
associated to a SNP is calculated by using kernel density estimation for the
null distribution and to compare the area under the curve until the MI value
of the SNP with the total area under the curve. Another possible approach
for obtaining the null distribution is to ﬁnd an analytical expression. The
distribution of ﬁnite sample size MI has been already approximated to a
gamma distribution (Goebel, 2005).

However, the required regularity conditions are not always met (Szymczak
et al., 2007). This approximation is imprecise when the sample size is small,
if the number per class differs substantially or if the number of classes is
small. It happens mostly when the number of SNPs in a set increases. In this
case, the null distribution will also depend on the minor allelic frequency
(MAF) of a particular SNP. This is the reason why the surrogate data approach
for generating the null distribution seems to be appropriate. This technique
generates copies of a SNP by destroying its individual order so that the allelic
frequencies are respected.

2.3.2 Single SNP signiﬁcance In order to avoid the comparison between
sets with different numbers of SNPs, this method propose to evaluate the
increase of information about the phenotype produced by a SNP against a
given set of SNPs. It is especially interesting in the context of a FS algorithm.
The null distribution associated to a SNP S,- is generated by NC surrogate
copies (Sr) of the SNP, respecting its allelic frequencies. Hence, given a set
of previously selected SNPs S and an SNP S,-, the MI of the total set against
the phenotype 11-21 (S +{S,-}; f) is compared with the null distribution of
MI ({Ir =I(S+{Sr};f):r=1...NC}), given by the MI of each random copy
S, of the SNP. The resulting P—value is the statistical signiﬁcance of the
gain of MI against the phenotype (f) produced by the SNP S,- on the set S.
This method has been called MISS (MI statistical signiﬁcance). The main
difference between this work and the one presented in Dawy (2006) are the
surrogate technique and the sequential search algorithm used for selecting
SNPs.

2.3.3 SNPs set signiﬁcance Once a set of SNPs is selected, another
statistical test is applied in order to determine if the selection set of SNPs,
jointly, have a signiﬁcant MI against the phenotype. This test consists in
comparing the MI of the set against the phenotype I(S; f) with a null
distribution of MI generated with NC surrogate copies of the phenotype.
The resulting P—value determines if the selection set, as a set, is signiﬁcantly
related with the phenotype.

For both signiﬁcance tests, the null distribution has been generated using
NC = 3000 surrogate copies. The p—values have been computed using kernel
density estimation of the null distribution (Wand and Jones, 1994) and
integrating the resulting density function.

2.4 Search method

Both MISS and MLR are relevance criteria to determine if the inclusion
of a SNP S,- in a set S produces an increase of information about the
phenotype. This relevance criterion will be used within a FS algorithm
in order to select the sets of SNPs signiﬁcantly related to the phenotype.

 

1. Initialization of the set S = {}.

2. Forward step: For each available SNP S), the p-value associated to its
information contribution to S is computed.

3. For each signiﬁcant SNP, a new forward search (2) is started from the
new set S=S+{S,-}. The forward step (2) is repeated whereas there are
signiﬁcant SNPs.

4. Backward step: For each SNP S,- in S, the p-value associated to the loss
of information when removing S,- from S is computed.

5. For each nonsigniﬁcant SNP, a new backward search (4) is started from
the new set S = S — {S1}. The backward step (4) is repeated whereas there
are nonsigniﬁcant SNPs and the set S has more than one SNP.

6. Go to step 2.

7. If there are neither signiﬁcant SNPs in step 3 nor nonsigniﬁcant SNPs in
step 5, the search is stopped.

 

 

 

Fig. 1. SFFS algorithm for genetic association.

Here, an adapted version of the SFFS algorithm will be applied. The
original sequential algorithms are one—solution algorithms and ﬁnd only one
suboptimal solution. The proposed version of SFFS ﬁnds all the possible
solutions.

The multi—solution strategy consists in starting a new search for each
signiﬁcant SNP. This variant of the SFFS algorithm returns multiple sets of
SNPs that are jointly able to represent the information of the phenotype. A
multi—solution sequential FS algorithm based on relevance chains has already
been proposed for SNP selection (Dawy, 2006). The main difference with
this algorithm is the ﬂoating strategy that avoids ﬁnding redundant SNPs.
When two SNPs with a similar variability among individuals are selected
together, the selection set contains twice the same information about the
phenotype. This occurs generally when SNPs are inherited together in the
same haplotype. The proposed ﬂoating algorithms avoid this problem.

Floating algorithms combine forward and backward steps as in Figure 1.
Forward steps add relevant features whereas backward steps allow to deﬂate
the selection set, removing the redundant SNPs. The algorithm starts with
a forward test due to the ﬁnite sample size effects. Only few SNPs are
enough for recovering the whole information about the phenotype so that
backward initial steps would remove all the SNPs, which involves starting
as much new searches as the number of SNPs in the original set, which is
computationally expensive. The SFFS algorithm do not depend on a required
number of forward and backward steps, but would ﬁnd SNPs as long as there
is signiﬁcance.

The algorithm obtains sets of SNPs that, together, show a signiﬁcant
correlation with the phenotype, but that do not share redundant information
one with each other. Thus, SNPs appearing in the same set may have a
different variability among individuals, and so may belong to different
haplotypic regions. The proposed algorithm has been applied in both
population—based and sib—pairs analysis. For each of them, the traditional
linear method have been compared with the proposed non—linear criterion.
The signiﬁcance threshold used in both relevance criteria has been set to 0.05.
The main structure of the developed algorithm is described in Figure 1.

2.5 The MISS package

The set of functions and algorithms developed for this study have been
integrated in a package for the R statistical language (R Development Core
Team, 2005). This package is called MISS and the version 0.2 is already
built and available by request to the authors. The MISS library contains a
documentation that includes examples of the use of the described algorithm
and its underlying functions using a SNP dataset. MISS allows for parallel
and distributed computing through MPI. Parallel implementation has been
coded on top of snow R—package, authored by (Tierney et al., 2004).

2.6 MECPM

The methodology described below has been compared with the MECPM
methodology (Miller et al., 2009). MECPM is an available algorithm based
on the maximum entropy principle. MECPM is designed for genotypic data.
It has been applied only to the founders dataset given that sib—pairs IBS data
format is incompatible with genotypic format. Besides that, the methodology
has been tested discretizing the phenotype in the same condition than for
MISS (using kernel functionals) and also with a two—class quantization. We
selected the approach giving the best results, which corresponds to a binary
phenotype.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The methodology described above has been applied to both a real
case corresponding to the F7 gene and to a simulated dataset.

3.1 Application to the F7 gene

Two datasets have been taken into account for the F7 gene study,
one considering only unrelated individuals and the other one
corresponding to sib—pairs. A total of 5 experiments have been
carried out. Three of them correspond to founders data whereas
the remaining two have been applied for sib—pairs. The proposed
ﬂoating FS has been applied with the two described criteria, the
linear one (MLR) and the non—linear one (MISS) in both datasets.
Moreover a third methodology, non—linear, corresponding to the
MECPM software has been applied for founders data. The results
obtained for the population—based study are presented in Table 1,
while Table 2 shows the results obtained in the sib—pairs analysis.
For each experiment, Tables 1 and 2 show the number of SNPs’
sets obtained (N), the average number of SNPs in a set (n), the
P—values order of magnitude and the most relevant sets of SNPs,
corresponding to the most statistical signiﬁcant ones. SNPs obtained
in Tables 1 and 2 are represented in Figure 2, showing their location
within the F7 gene.

Fig. 2. SNPs localization within the F7 gene.

It can be observed in Table 1 that for founders data, MLR ﬁnds
more sets of SNPs (N 2151) than MECPM (N = 62) and than MISS
(N :48). Sets obtained with MLR contain more SNPs (n26) than
MISS (11:2) and MECPM which found single SNPs related with
the phenotype and did not ﬁnd interactions of SNPs predicting FVII
levels in blood. Most of the SNPs obtained in the three cases are
reported in the literature as functional variants related with FVII
concentrations.

The SNPs’ sets obtained using MLR are similar since they contain
common SNPs. The SNPs that make the sets different (rs762636,
rs36208415, rs36208416 and rs510317) contain similar information
about the phenotype. These SNPs appear in Soria et al. (2005) in
the same cluster of SNPs with a high probability of posterior effect
on the phenotype and are located in the promoter region or in splice
sites as shown in Figure 2.

The SNPs’ sets obtained using MISS also contain common
information. SNPs that make the sets different (rs491098, rs510335
and rs561241) appear in the same cluster of SNPs in Soria et al.
(2005). Moreover, both SNPs rs493833 and rs491098 belong to
the ﬁfth intron of the F7 gene. It is important to remark that the
sets obtained with the proposed ﬂoating search algorithm contain
SNPs that do not give information about the phenotype but that

complement each other. SNPs appearing in the same set may not
belong to the same haplotype and can belong to different regions
of the gene as they do not show signiﬁcant r2 in the LD plot in
Figure 3.

Most of the SNPs found with MECPM have been reported in the
literature as functional polymorphisms related with the phenotype.

It can be observed in Table 2 that for sib—pairs data, MLR only
found 3 sets of SNPS, whereas MISS found 50 sets, a similar number
than using founders data. As for the population—based study, sets
obtained using MLR contain more SNPs (n24) than sets obtained
with MISS (n: 3). Conversely to the founders case, MISS obtains
higher P—values than MLR. SNP sets obtained with MLR are also
similar being differentiated by SNPs rs762636, rs762635 and jointly
by rs2774033 and rs6039. SNPs rs762736 and rs762635 are in the
same cluster in Soria et al. (2005), while SNP rs6039 appears in
another cluster. Most of the sets are composed by SNPs that appear in
different clusters in Soria et al. (2005), giving different information
about the phenotype. In particular, SNP rs3 6209567, also known as
A294V, appears in several sets and is located in the ninth exon of the
F7 gene, producing an amino acid change in the resulting protein
from an alanine to a valine. SNP rs36208758 is also located in the
third exon but it is a missense mutation that does not produce any
amino acid change in the resulting protein (Fig. 2).

3.2 Application to simulated data

The simulation study has been developed to validate the performance
of our methodology in detecting true interactions between SNPs
and a phenotype deﬁned by an epistatic multiplicative model. For
each method, we built six datasets of different size, corresponding
to 5, 10, 15, 20, 25 and 50 SNPs and 85 samples. The datasets
contain two SNPs of the F7 gene and random SNPs non—related
with the phenotype, generated by a multiplicative model based on the

information of the two SNPs. The correlation between the synthetic
phenotype and the two selected SNPs, as a set, is non—linear as it
has been built through a multiplicative model.

MLR only detects one of the SNPs, regardless of the size of the
dataset. MECPM ﬁnds several SNPs as individual sets, including
the two selected SNPs. In contrast, for each dataset size, MISS is
able to detect sets containing both SNPs.

Table 3 shows the CPU time corresponding to each method. All
computations were performed on a 12 Intel E7310 processors (4 MB
Cache 1.60GHz) with 32 GB random access memory. MISS was
launched using snow on MP1 mode over the 12 nodes. MECPM
has been applied to a binary phenotype, giving faster and better
results whereas with MLR and MISS it has been discretized into
eight categories using Wand (1996). The parameters of MISS have
been also adjusted in beneﬁt of obtaining a right detection with
the minimum computational cost. Thus, the null distribution has

been generated with 100 surrogate copies. MISS computing time
contains the total computing time employed by all CPUs involved.
The computational cost of the real case described previously is
also presented in Table 3. It can be observed that the use of MISS
slows down the ﬂoating search algorithm in comparison with MLR.
However, MISS is faster than MECPM for the simulated dataset. For
the real dataset, MISS is computationally more expensive due to the
dependence of the parameters of the null distribution generation that
should be larger for real data.

3.3 Discussion

As this study is a local association analysis focused on the F7 gene,
functional studies about F7 polymorphisms are used to validate our
results. Most of the SNPs found have been reported in the literature
as functional elements correlated with the phenotype. The results
presented in Soria et al. (2005) were conﬁrmed by the same group
in Sabater—Lleal et al. (2007) by functional assays. Moreover, some
of these results have been also replicated by association analysis
and/or functional assays in van’t Hooft et al. (1999), Yang et al.
(2007), Marchetti et al. (1993), Wulff and Hermann (2000), Feng
et al. (2000) and Pollak et al. (1996).

It has been observed that results obtained for founders data are
different than results obtained in the sib—pairs analysis. Most of these
differences are due to the differences in the datasets, containing
different individuals and different genotypic measures. However,
intrinsic differences in the variability of genetic data between
individuals may also inﬂuence the results. The large variability
present in founders genetic data may increase the false positive
discovery (Lawrence et al., 2005). This has been observed with
the high values of N and n, especially with MLR. MISS is more
conservative as it ﬁnds a similar number of SNP sets for both datasets
(N ~ 50).

Contrarin to the genotypic variability, the variance of the
phenotypic differences of the sib—pairs is higher (V: 1159.7) than
the variance of the phenotypes of the founders (V:826.3). This
variability can only be expressed through the combinations of
SNPs. This combinations are more easily found using MISS (50
combinations obtained) than using MLR (only 3 combinations).

Using the comparison with the synthetic dataset, it has been
observed that neither MLR nor MECPM ﬁnd the true positive
corresponding to the combination of the ﬁrst two SNPs whereas
MISS is able to detect this interaction. Figure 3 illustrates
this through a singular case (generated with founders data). It
can be observed that SNPs rs9604025 and rs510335 are not
individually signiﬁcantly correlated with the phenotype, whereas
the combination of these two SNPs is signiﬁcantly related with the
phenotype (red square). Moreover, this combination of SNPs is not
detected as a signiﬁcant one using MLR or MECPM. SNP rs9604025
appears in Soria et al. (2005) as a functional variant related to FVII
levels. SNP rs510335 is a relevant SNP cited in many works related
to the factor VII. The rare T allele is associated with lower plasma
concentrations of FVII protein and fully activated FVII molecules
(van’t Hooft et al., 1999). Moreover, the LD plot shows that these
SNPs do not present a signiﬁcant correlation. On one hand, Figure 3
demonstrates that the multi—site strategy detect genotype—phenotype
associations that one—by—one SNP approaches do not detect. On the
other hand, it has been shown that some of these combinatorial

effects of SNPs on the phenotype are found using MISS whereas
they are not detected with the other linear or non—linear approaches.
However, this accuracy is obtained by increasing the complexity
and sacriﬁcing the computational performance of the algorithm. This
is not a critical point for local association studies like this, but it may
become severer in a genome—wide association study (GWAS).

4 CONCLUSION

We have presented the MISS methodology, a non—linear method for
genetic association based on the MI statistical signiﬁcance of sets
of SNPs against a phenotype under study. This method has been
applied as a relevance criterion of a ﬂoating FS algorithm, proposed
in the context of genetic association for complex diseases. MISS
has been compared with MLR, a linear method commonly used for
genetic association and with MECPM, an algorithm for searching
predictive multi—loci interactions. The different methods have been
tested with two samples of the GAIT project, corresponding to a
population—based study and a sib—pairs analysis and also with a
simulated dataset. In particular, the goal was to ﬁnd association
between SNPs of the F7 gene and factor VII protein plasma levels.
It has been demonstrated that with GAIT project data and a synthetic
dataset, MISS improves the results of traditional genetic association
methods. On one hand, multi—site association improves the results
obtained with one—by—one SNP association methods, showing that
combinations of SNPs may contain information about the phenotype
that single SNPs are not able to capture. On the other hand, the
proposed non—linear method (MISS) is not only able to recover
the results from other methods but it also improves them, ﬁnding
correlations between genotype and phenotype not detected with the
other methods. Several sets of SNPs of the F7 gene have been found
as genetic features able to describe the information of the phenotype
(FVII levels in blood). The results obtained in this study for the F7
gene have been validated by previous works using an experimental
approach. Most of the obtained SNPs have been previously reported
in the literature as functional variants that have a molecular effect
on FVII levels. The application of MISS to the simulated dataset
has proven its capacity of ﬁnding true associations against the
other methods. However, this accuracy is obtained at the cost of
an increased computational task of the algorithm that should be
improved for its use in GWASs and for its application to other
diseases or phenotypes.

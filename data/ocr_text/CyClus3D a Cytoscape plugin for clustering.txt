ABSTRACT

Summary: Network motifs in integrated molecular networks
represent functional relationships between distinct data types. They
aggregate to form dense topological structures corresponding to
functional modules which cannot be detected by traditional graph
clustering algorithms. We developed CyClus3D, a Cytoscape plugin
for clustering composite three-node network motifs using a 3D
spectral clustering algorithm.

1 INTRODUCTION

In systems biology, the cell is modeled as an integrated network
with multiple types of interactions, e. g. protein—protein, protein—
DNA, protein—metabolite or genetic interactions (Zhu et al., 2007).
Cellular functions are carried out by independently functioning units
called modules (Hartwell et al., 1999), which, in graph—theoretical
terms, correspond to clusters of densely connected nodes, and
a multitude of algorithms have been developed to identify such
clusters in undirected graphs (Fortunato, 2010). A major problem
remains how to harness the multilayered information contained
in different interaction networks in order to identify biologically
more realistic topological modules. In the naive Bayes approach,
multiple interaction types are overlayed to create a single integrated
association network which can be clustered by traditional means
(Lee et al., 2004). In the SAMBA approach, heterogeneous data
types are merged in a single bipartite gene—property graph in which
modules are deﬁned as dense subgraphs (Tanay et al., 2004).
While SAMBA has the advantage of preserving the identity of
each interaction type, information is inevitably lost by representing
complex networks as bipartite graphs.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.
IThe authors wish it to be known that, in their opinion, the ﬁrst two authors
should be regarded as joint First Authors.

We developed CyClus3D, a Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003)
plugin for the identiﬁcation of modules in integrated networks
which uses network motifs to query a 3D spectral clustering
algorithm. Network motifs are frequently occuring subgraphs in
regulatory (Shen—Orr et al., 2002) or integrated networks (Yeger—
Lotem et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2006), which aggregate to form
topological modules (Kashtan et al., 2004; Zhang et al., 2005).
Each network motif deﬁnes a relationship between heterogeneous
data types, with a distinct information—processing role or functional
interpretation (Shen—Orr et al., 2002; Zhang et al., 2005; Zhu et al.,
2007). Hence, CyClus3D identiﬁes modules composed of multiple
interaction types which reﬂect regulatory, signaling or compensatory
pathway mechanisms in addition to the stable protein complexes
found by traditional clustering algorithms.

2 METHODS

2.1 Network motif clustering algorithm

We consider a system modeled by N types of pairwise interactions which
may be directed or undirected. For a given three—node network motif whose
edges can be of any type, we denote the list of all motif instances as a 3D
array T with T ijk :1 if the system contains a motif between nodes (i,j,k),
and 0 otherwise. We deﬁne a motif cluster by three sets of nodes (X 1 ,X2,X3)
with an aggregation score

SX,X ,X 2—7

(1)
where |X| is the number of nodes in X and p>l will act as an (inverse)
resolution parameter. To maximize S, we ﬁrst determine the best rank—l
approximation to T, i.e. ﬁnd real—valued vectors (x1,x2,x3) maximizing

solving the Euler—Lagrange equations

subject to the constraint ||x1||p=l and similarly for the other dimensions
(De Lathauwer et al., 2000). The solutions (x1,x2,x3) are interpreted as
cluster membership weight vectors and converted to a motif cluster by taking
a suitable threshold on the weights. It can be shown that the optimal threshold
is the one which minimizes ||xm —uXm up, where “X,- = |X|-1/P for ieX and
0 otherwise (see Supplementary Material). Having thus found a high—scoring

motif cluster, we remove it from the list of motif instances T and repeat the
procedure until no more instances remain. The best rank—1 approximation
to the motif index array plays the same role as the dominant eigenvector
of a network adjacency matrix and our algorithm can be understood as a
generalization of 2D spectral clustering algorithms (Inoue and Urahama,
1999).

2.2 Implementation

Network motifs are often invariant under the permutation of some of their
nodes. Thus, motif instances need to know their inherent symmetries, e.g.
to efﬁciently determine the equality of two instances. We generated the
motif symmetry groups ofﬂine and used a code generator to generate Java
classes which are equipped with optimized methods for comparing and
storing motifs. To locate all motif instances, we developed a motif ﬁnder
which works on the principle of motif extensions. It allows quick pruning
of branches in the search tree and is signiﬁcantly faster than other subgraph
matching algorithms (see Supplementary Material). To solve Equations (2)
we implemented a power algorithm (De Lathauwer et al., 2000). The Java
classes for network motif enumeration and clustering are independent of
the Cytoscape visualization classes and can be plugged into other network
analysis and visualization environments as well.

3 APPLICATION

To illustrate the workﬂow of CyClus3D (postﬁx for ﬂimensional
@tering in Cytoscape), we imported an integrated network of
physical, geneE and signaling interactions between kinases and
phosphatases in yeast (Breitkreutz et al., 2010; Fiedler et al., 2009)
(data available as Supplementary Material). In the CyClus3D control
panel (Fig. 1A), a query motif and one or more input networks are
selected, interaction types are assigned to each edge and a value
for the resolution parameter r =1/p (cf. Section 2) and the minimal
number of motif instances in a cluster are set. An edge type is inferred
to be directed if the edge in the motif it is assigned to is directed. The
resolution parameter allows to vary the typical size and density of a
cluster. At low r, the aggregation score is maximized by large sets of
loosely connected motifs, while at high values, high—scoring motif
clusters are small and dense. In our experience, the intermediate
value r=0.5 balances size and density and is recommended as a
starting value (see Supplementary Material).

After running the algorithm, CyClus3D opens a new network
containing all clustered motifs. For instance, Figure 1B shows
all clusters of genetically interacting, copointing kinases (with the
settings of Fig. 1A). By right clicking on a node of interest, we
can create new networks for the clusters containing this node, while
through the CyClus3D entry in the Plugins menu, new networks can
be created for all clusters. By default, edges in multicluster networks
are colored by their cluster membership (‘Cluster View’, Fig. 1B),
while in single—cluster networks they are colored by interaction type,
with the colors matching the edge assignments in the control panel
(‘Interaction View’, Fig. 1C). Via the VizMapper panel, the user can
easily switch between these two visual styles. Multiple motifs can
be clustered sequentially and newly found clusters either are added
to or replace the existing clustered network (to add them, all query
motifs must be formed from subsets of the same three edge types and
the Interaction View will be updated to the latest edge assignment).

By integrating heterogeneous types of molecular interaction data,
CyClus3D identiﬁes modules which reﬂect regulatory, signaling or
compensatory functions which are not found by clustering each
network in isolation (Zhang et al., 2005). The underlying algorithms
are highly efﬁcient and allow further extension. In particular,
future versions will extend CyClus3D toward higher dimensional
motifs, with applications in the domain of network alignment and
comparison.

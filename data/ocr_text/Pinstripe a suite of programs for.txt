ABSTRACT

Motivation: Comparing transcriptomic data with proteomic data to
identify protein-coding sequences is a long-standing challenge in mo-
lecular biology, one that is exacerbated by the increasing size of
high-throughput datasets. To address this challenge, and thereby to
improve the quality of genome annotation and understanding of
genome biology, we have developed an integrated suite of programs,
called Pinstripe. We demonstrate its application, utility and discovery
power using transcriptomic and proteomic data from publicly available
datasets.

Results: To demonstrate the efficacy of Pinstripe for large-scale ana-
lysis, we applied Pinstripe’s reverse peptide mapping pipeline to a
transcript library including de novo assembled transcriptomes from
the human Illumina Body Atlas (IBA2) and GENCODE v10 gene anno-
tations, and the EBI Proteomics Identifications Database (PRIDE) pep-
tide database. This analysis identified 736 canonical open reading
frames (ORFs) supported by three or more PRIDE peptide fragments
that are positioned outside any known coding DNA sequence (CDS).
Because of the unfiltered nature of the PRIDE database and high
probability of false discovery, we further refined this list using inde-
pendent evidence for translation, including the presence of a Kozak
sequence or functional domains, synonymous/non-synonymous sub-
stitution ratios and ORF length. Using this integrative approach, we
observed evidence of translation from a previously unknown let7e pri-
mary transcript, the archetypical lncRNA H19, and a homolog of RD3.
Reciprocally, by exclusion of transcripts with mapped peptides or sig-
nificant ORFs (>80 codon), we identify 32187 loci with RNAs longer
than 2000 nt that are unlikely to encode proteins.

Availability and implementation: Pinstripe (pinstripe.matticklab.com)
is freely available as source code or a Mono binary. Pinstripe is written
in C# and runs under the Mono framework on Linux or Mac OS X, and
both under Mono and .Net under Windows.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although the annotation of the human genome has undergone
considerable effort, with >20 000 protein-coding loci identiﬁed,
the extent to which the genome is transcribed and subsequently
translated remains unclear (Clark et al., 2011; Flicek et al., 2010).
As well as mRNAs, long RNAs with little or no protein-coding
capacity (long non-coding RNAs or lncRNAs) are abundantly
expressed from the human genome with >10 000 non-coding loci
currently in GENCODE (the most comprehensive annotation of
the human genome). Adding to the known catalog of RNAs,
transcriptomic sequencing experiments are identifying thousands
of new transcripts on an ongoing basis (Trapnell et al., 2010).
Confidently determining which RNAs encode proteins is dif-
ficult. Traditional approaches classify the protein-coding poten-
tial of an RNA based on the presence of long canonical open
reading frames (ORFs), phylogenomic evidence of codon con-
servation (Dinger et al., 2008) and/or recognized functional do-
mains. The former approach is highly dependent on ORF length,
with ~100 codons typically used as the threshold for the identi-
fication of mRNAs (Carninci et al., 2005; Imanishi et al., 2004).
However, this approach results in an unknown false negative and
positive rate, as shorter proteins are known to exist, and short
ORFs can occur by chance (Dinger et al., 2011). Phylogenomic
comparisons also have limitations, notably their inability to
detect orphan genes lacking homologs in other lineages (Tautz
and Domazet-Loso, 2011), and the tendency for recently evolved
genes to encode smaller proteins than older genes (Lipman et al.,
2002). Moreover, data from which evidence of ORF and codon
conservation can be determined are limited, especially at short
evolutionary distances. Annotation of protein-coding genes
is further confounded by factors such as RNA editing,

Pinstripe: a suite of programs for integrating transcriptomic and proteomic datasets

 

genotypic variation, non-canonical start codons and ribosomal
frameshifting.

Although many of the transcripts identiﬁed in de novo
assembled transcriptomes can be annotated through comparison
with known reference databases such as GENCODE (Flicek
et al., 2010) or RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007), this approach does
not provide a means for classifying novel transcripts and is en-
tirely dependent on the accuracy of the reference database. Even
determining the protein-coding capacity of novel transcript iso-
forms of known genes is not straightforward, as the insertion,
deletion and extension of exons may disrupt the existing ORF or
establish an alternative ORF. Identifying the consequences of
such events to the encoded protein sequence on a genomic
scale is challenging and not addressed by existing tools.
Although the comparison of transcriptomic datasets to identify
overlapping/non-overlapping features is facilitated by applica-
tions such as BEDTools (Quinlan and Hall, 2010), such applica-
tions do not consider the frame of the CDS.

The classiﬁcation of novel transcripts with a putative ORF can
be discerned with greater conﬁdence using proteomic data.
Mapping of proteomic sequences to transcriptomic data is typic-
ally performed using software such as BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990) or BLAT (Kent et al., 2002). Use of these programs with
high-throughput transcriptomic datasets requires considerable
pre— and post-processing. Custom nucleotide sequence diction-
aries must be created from spliced genomic coordinates before
BLAST comparisons, and resulting matches are reported with
respect to mRNA coordinates that require transformation into
genomic coordinates. After mapping, each ORF then needs to be
analyzed to determine the extent of supporting proteomic data.
Currently, there is no software to facilitate this process, although
high-throughput proteomic—genomic comparisons in Arabidopsis
(Castellana et al., 2008) and proteomic—transcriptomic integra-
tion in mice (Brosch et al., 2011) have been undertaken.

Here, we present an integrated software suite, Pinstripe, which
overcomes many of the difﬁculties in such tasks, providing
programs (Supplementary Table S1) to analyze transcriptomes,
speciﬁcally enabling: (i) ORF-aware comparison with protein-
coding gene annotations identifying CDSs with in-frame overlap,
(ii) mapping of proteomic data to the transcriptome (leveraging
BLASTP and TBLASTN) and reporting results as genomic co-
ordinates and (iii) annotation of ORFs supported by peptides
from proteomic datasets. In addition, Pinstripe features a multi-
tude of tools for analyzing transcriptomes, including intersection
by feature name, identiﬁcation of best representative transcripts
for loci and extraction of DNA sequence or predicted ORFs
from genomic coordinates. We demonstrate the utility of
Pinstripe by analyzing transcriptomes assembled de novo from
high-throughput RNA sequencing of 16 human tissues and
mass spectrometry from the EMBL-EBI Proteomics
Identiﬁcations Database (PRIDE) (Vizcaino et al., 2009), ﬁnding
previously unidentiﬁed protein-coding regions and providing
high-conﬁdence annotations for thousands of long ncRNAs.

2 METHODS

Pinstripe is a multiprocessor-enabled application designed for the rapid
high-throughput analysis of de novo or reference-guided transcriptome
assemblies generated by tools such as T ophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) and

Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2010) or Trinity (Grabherr et al., 2011). In
terms of performance, Pinstripe can identify ORFs, the corresponding
amino acid sequence and level of support in ~5 min using a single-core
2.27GHz Intel Xeon processor for 1 million transcripts queried against
500 000 pre—mapped peptide sequences (pepFrags). Mapped pepFrag ﬁles
require <80 Mb per 1 million pepFrags. The application is programed in
C#, and the compiled binary runs under Mono on Linux or MacOS X,
and both Mono and .NET under Windows. Here, we demonstrate
its implementation using transcriptomes assembled de novo from
high-throughput RNA sequencing of 16 human tissues and mass spec-
trometry peptide identiﬁcations from public databases.

Pinstripe uses the UCSC Browser Extensible Data (BED/BED12)
format to describe the chromosomal positions of input transcripts. This
format is compact, storing information regarding a single transcript’s
exons and CDS in a single row of data. Annotation reference ﬁles for
most transcript and gene collections are readily available in BED12
format from the UCSC Table Browser. For compatibility with
Pinstripe, Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) ﬁles can be converted to,
and compared with, BED ﬁles using programs such as BEDTools.
Gene Transfer Format (GTF) ﬁles can be converted to BED format
using a combination of tools available from UCSC, and basic command
line utilities (refer Supplementary Material).

2.1 Identiﬁcation of mRNA

mRNA are most easily identiﬁed by comparing transcripts with a data-
base of validated gene annotations such as RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007) or
GENCODE (Becker, 2011). The difﬁculty with this approach is that de
novo transcriptomes, such as those assembled from high-throughput
RNA sequencing experiments, can reveal both new transcripts that do
not correspond to any annotation, and variants of known transcripts with
additional exons, alternate splice sites or alternative UTRs, all of which
may result in ORF disruption. Any comparison involving a novel tran-
script isoforrn requires consideration of the frame in which potential
CDSs are translated. These problems are exacerbated for poorly anno-
tated genomes or where a reference is not available.

To address this challenge, Pinstripe provides two methods for identify-
ing mRNA in CDS-naive transcripts. First, Pinstripe annotate compares
each transcript with a gene reference, annotating a CDS if the three-frame
conceptual translation of the query transcript yields an ORF coincident
(within tolerances deﬁned by user options) with the reference, and in the
same frame.

Alternatively, Pinstripe mapPeptides takes peptide fragments
(pepFrags) from mass spectrometry (or other proteomic data) and
maps them to the transcriptome (Fig. 1). mapPeptides creates a BLAST
(Camacho et al., 2009) dictionary from the queried transcript library and
maps the pepFrag amino acid sequences against the dictionary with
user-deﬁnable parameters. The resultant BLAST matches are then trans-
lated from local mRNA coordinates to genomic coordinates (including
those pepFrags mapping across splice junctions) and post-processed
to remove redundancy (where pepFrags map to different mRNAs but
resolve to the same genomic position). The original transcript library is
matched to any overlapping pepFrags and potential ORFs (canonical
and non-canonical) identiﬁed through in silico translation using
Pinstripe buildProteins. Each transcript is reported with details of which
pepFrags map to it, the amino acid sequence of the ORF and the ORF
length. An example workﬂow is shown in Figure 2. Workﬂows for the
main Pinstripe programs, mapPeptides, buildProteins and annotate are
shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

Examples of Pinstripe usage to annotate ORFs from a CDS-naive
transcriptome are as follows:

2.2 Classiﬁcation of lncRNAs

lncRNAs are deﬁned as long mRNA-like transcripts that are not known
to encode proteins, and which exhibit little or no protein-coding capacity.
Because of the likelihood of long RNAs containing an ORF by chance
alone, lncRNAs and mRNAs cannot be simply distinguished by the ab-
sence or presence of an ORF (Dinger et al., 2008, 2011). Pinstripe sup-
ports classiﬁcation of RNAs whose coding status is unresolved using a
combination of programs, and allows the incorporation of data from
other applications for assessing protein-coding potential, such as
PhyloCSF (Lin et al., 2011). The previously described annotate program
not only identiﬁes those RNAs with and without an in-frame CDS over-
lap to a reference but it also identiﬁes RNAs without an ORF satisfying
user-speciﬁed criteria—for example, an ORF length <80 codons and a
start methionine. Pinstripe overlap identiﬁes transcripts with overlapping
in-frame CDSs at different tolerances, supporting identiﬁcation of tran-
script isoforrns, and characterize calculates the Kozak sequence strength,
genomic context and probability of the ORF occurring by chance

these applications are included in Supplementary Fig. S1

according to transcript length (refer Supplementary Text). Data from
external programs are easily combined with Pinstripe ’s ﬁles using
Pinstripe join, a BED format-speciﬁc program for identifying related
data in different ﬁles, similar to a multiprocessor implementation of
UNIX sort and UNIX join. Removal of mRNAs and those RNAs
with uncertain coding potential reveals transcripts most likely to represent
bona ﬁde ncRNAs. An example workﬁow is shown in Figure 3.

3 RESULTS

To demonstrate the efﬁcacy of Pinstripe for annotating transcrip-
tomic data, we mapped non-redundant human pepFrags from
the PRIDE database (Vizcaino et al., 2009) against a composite
transcript library including de novo assembled transcriptomes
from the Illumina Body Atlas of 16 human tissues (IBA2),
ENCODE’s GENCODE gene annotations (comprehensive)
v10 (GCT10) and GenBank’s database of human mRNA
(Benson et al., 2004). The GENCODE and GenBank datasets
were included to provide coverage of transcripts from tissues not
included in the IBA2, an important consideration when deter-
mining whether a pepFrag maps to a single, or multiple tran-
scribed genomic positions.

3.1 Transcriptome assembly of the IBA2

The IBA2 is a collection of RNA sequencing experiments con-
sisting of 2.54 billion reads across 16 human tissues: adipose,
adrenal, breast, brain, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph,
ovary, prostate, skeletal muscle, testes, thyroid and white blood

Fig. 3. Identiﬁcation of different classes of novel CDSs using Pinstripe
overlap, and annotation using characterize, findBest and join. Setting par-
ameters to require a 100% match identiﬁes annotated genes (Dataset 1);
lower settings represent potential novel transcript isoforms of annotated
genes (Datasets 2 and 3). Comparing mapped pepFrags with an annota-
tion identiﬁes those not included in an existing CDS. These non-CDS
pepFrags can be compared with the novel isoforms to identify those with
novel pepFrag support (Dataset 3) and those without (Dataset 2). The —v
option of overlap reports non-overlapping CDSs (Dataset 4) representing
completely novel ORFs. Additional processing with characterize anno-
tates ORFs to include Kozak sequence, ORF probability and genomic
context. The results of other publicly available applications such as
PhyloCSF, IPRScan and Signalp can be directly appended to the anno-
tated BED ﬁle using Pinstripe join

cells (see Supplementary Text). We mapped the sequence reads
using T ophat (Trapnell et al., 2009) and assembled transcrip-
tomes for each tissue with Caﬂlinks (Trapnell et al., 2010)
guided by GENCODE v10, ﬁnding 59.5% of the genome was
transcribed across the aggregate of tissues, with an average of
39.4% transcribed in each individual tissue, varying from 31.7%
(white blood) to 48.2% (testis) (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2,
Supplementary Fig. S2). Our mapping of this dataset revealed
broadly similar results to those reported by Cabili et al. (2011)
who constructed transcriptomes from the same datasets in a
genome-wide study of lincRNAs (Cabili et al., 2011). However,
in our analysis, we report only proper pairs (paired end) or
aligned reads (single end) in our results leading to a lower map-
ping yield averaging 77.6% across both sets (Supplementary
Table S1).

Of the 28 380 RefSeq-annotated protein-coding transcripts
expressed, 56.6% (16052) were found in 14 or more of the

16 tissues, and 14.7% (4187) were present only in a single
tissue, the largest fraction (42.4%; 1775) of which were found
in testis.

3.2 Peptide mapping

We mapped 421466 non-redundant pepFrags derived from the
PRIDE database (Vizcaino et al., 2009) against the composite
transcriptome library using Pinstripe mapPeptides, successfully
positioning 290104 pepFrags (no mismatch, deletion or inser-
tions), 255 825 of which mapped to a single genomic location
(allowing for up to three mismatches). A further 256 pepFrags
mapped to unpositioned contigs or haplotypes but were not used
in subsequent analyses.

The 131 106 pepFrags that could not be positioned demon-
strate the unreliable nature of data from the PRIDE repository.
Although the differing quality of individual submissions makes
an aggregated assessment of the entire database impossible with-
out reanalysis of the original spectra, even an estimate based on
the number of pepFrags that can be positioned on the human
genome demonstrates that PRIDE data alone provides unreli-
able evidence of a protein’s existence. With a 31.1% chance that
any entry from the database does not map to the human genome
or transcriptome, even a superﬁcial assessment requires an indi-
vidual ORF to be supported by three pepFrags for a 5% False
Discovery Rate (FDR) or four pepFrags to achieve 1% FDR.
As a result, even ORFs with multiple matching pepFrags can
only be considered to have a ‘line of evidence’ that an ORF
may be translated, requiring additional support from other in
silico analysis techniques such as conservation analysis, ORF
probability or functional predictions, or biological validation.

For our analysis, we aimed to determine whether there was
evidence of ORFs with pepFrag support and additional pre-
dictors of protein-coding potential, which remain unannotated
in GENCODE v10. To identify these ORFs, we used the
Pinstripe ORF-aware overlap program to identify 14 630
pepFrags with no in-frame overlap to a known GCT10 CDS
from the 255825 uniquely mapping pepFrags. We then ran
buildProteins with only these 14630 non-CDS coincident
GCT10 pepFrags revealing a set of 12471 unannotated ORFs.
We selected the most highly supported ORF from each locus in
terms of proteomic support and ORF length using Pinstripe
fina’Best, (default parameters) resulting in 5561 non-overlapping
CDS-annotated transcripts.

Pinstripe overlap revealed that 1130 of the 5561 CDSs contain
an in-frame overlap to a GCT10 transcript, 129 of which had
three or more mapping pepFrags. These ORFs arise from tran-
script isoforms of known genes that potentially encode novel
protein variants, many of which are larger than the annotated
product. For example, GIPC3 is a 312-amino acid protein
encoded from chromosome 19 in which a previously unanno-
tated splice site in the second last exon (PCR validation results
in Supplementary Fig. S3) changes the reading frame of the ﬁnal
exon, extending the length of the ORF >400% to 1350 amino
acids (Fig. 4a) and incorporating six pepFrags. Although the
ORF extension partially matches the 584-amino acid Uniprot
record Q8N7K9, there is no independent GENCODE-annotated
transcript that would encode the ORF, and there are no histone

exon of GIPC3, extending the RefSeq ORF (dark blue) >400% through

novel protein coding region. 0)) Several novel splicing events (royal blue)
integrate a novel 3’ exon and substituting different RefSeq exons (dark
blue) in AAKI. The novel 3’ exon is supported by 11 pepFrags (light
blue). Expression data for brain (red) and testes (light green) shows differ-
ent conﬁgurations are dominant in different tissues

modiﬁcations indicative of the transcription initiation necessary
for an independent Q8N7K9 transcript.

Similarly, AAKI exhibits novel splicing variants resulting in
omission of between one and ﬁve exons and a 9-kb region of the
3’-UTR (Fig. 4b). The resultant novel transcript isoform (see
Supplementary Fig. S3 for PCR) substitutes up to 210 amino
acids of the canonical protein’s N-terminus with a completely
different 307 amino acids and is supported by 11 pepFrags
attributed to the 355-amino acid Uniprot protein Q6ZSR9,
which, similarly to Q8N7K9, has no evidence to support its tran-
scription except as the 3’-UTR of AAKI.

The reverse peptide mapping technique can also be used to
provide experimental support for RefSeq genes whose status is
annotated as either ‘predicted’, ‘provisional’, ‘inferred’ or ‘un-
known’. We interrogated 2213 such RefSeq genes and intersected
these with the mapped PRIDE pepFrags, identifying 1100
(49.7%) ORFs having four or more pepFrags mapping to the
ORF. Nineteen of these were not annotated in GENCODE v11.

3.3 Potentially novel protein-coding genes

After excluding novel isoforms of known genes, we identiﬁed
4432 canonical ORFs containing at least one uniquely mapping
non-GCT10 pepFrag, of which 736 and 358 were supported by
three and four or more non-GCT10 pepFrags, respectively.

The majority (81.8%) of the unannotated canonical ORFs
identiﬁed (excluding isoforms) are <200 codons (Fig. 5), consist-
ent with larger ORFs being more easily identiﬁed by both la-
boratory and informatic techniques. Indeed, the impact of
minimum size criteria applied by in silico gene prediction projects
such as FANTOM (Carninci et al., 2005) (100 codons) and
H-Invitational (Imanishi et al., 2004) (80 codons) is evident in
the size distributions with a difference in the distribution of ORF
size where prediction algorithm cutoffs apply (Fig. 5).

As previously noted, matched pepFrags alone provide insufﬁ-
cient evidence for the identiﬁcation of proteins. To identify
which of these ORFs most likely represent bona ﬁde protein-
coding genes, and to demonstrate the Pinstripe join and charac-
terize programs, we integrated data from other analyses includ-
ing (i) protein-coding likelihood score across 29 mammal species
from PhyloCSF (Lin et al., 2011), (ii) the probability of the ORF
occurring by chance (Dinger et al., 2011), (iii) presence in the
pseudogenescrg pseudogene database (Karro et al., 2007),
(iv) signal peptide potential (Bendtsen et al., 2004), (v) similarity
to known human and non-human proteins (Camacho et al.,
2009; Zdobnov and preiler, 2001) and (vi) Kozak se-
quence strength (Kozak, 1987). This data are available in
Supplementary Table S5.

Each candidate was also annotated by its genomic context
relative to GCTlO-annotated genes identifying: (i) genes anno-
tated as non-coding yet coincident with pepFrag mapping sites,
(ii) coding regions within the 3’ or 5’-UTR of known
protein-coding genes, (iii) genes with no overlap to known

Pinstripe: a suite of programs for integrating transcriptomic and proteomic datasets

 

transcripts (intergenic) and (iv) genes located within the introns
of other genes.

3.4 Novel ORFs

To provide examples of potential results of Pinstripe analysis, we
characterized selected potential proteins using bioinformatic and
experimental tools. A BLAST (Camacho et al., 2009) compari-
son of the 4431 non-GCT10 canonical ORFs (excluding iso-
forms) against the full UniProt (Uniprot Consortium, 2010)
non-redundant database of known and predicted proteins re-
vealed signiﬁcant (E-value<10_10) matches for 2604 (58.8%),
601 of which had UniProt annotations of ‘hypothetical’ or ‘pre—
dicted’. In two cases [PRAC2; (Olsson et al., 2003) and a
5’-UTR-derived isoform of M YC (Choi et al., 2008)], literature
searches revealed candidates matching experimentally validated
proteins not recorded in UniProt. PhyloCSF scored 926 (20.9%)
of the ORFs as 10 or greater, a result indicating the product is
considered 10 times more likely to represent a coding RNA than
an ncRNA. Signal3p (Bendtsen et al., 2004) identiﬁed 226 of the
novel ORFs as having strongly predicted secretion signals,
whereas the Pinstripe speciﬁcator program annotated 940 as spe-
ciﬁc to a single tissue (see Supplementary Text). Tissue-speciﬁc
protein candidates are most frequently observed in testis (46.5%)
in accordance with previously reported enrichments for novel
and recently evolved genes in Drosophila testes (Begun et al.,
2007; Levine et al., 2006).

Analyzing the output identiﬁed a number of novel ORFs
for which translation was supported by multiple lines of evidence
including RD3-like protein (RD3L; Fig. 6a), a 198-amino acid
protein encoded at 14q32.33, which is conserved in tetrapods
and exhibits some similarity to RD3 (27% identity,
E—value=4 x 10‘”), a protein expressed in the eye and asso-
ciated with retinal degeneration (Friedman et al., 2006). Within
the IBA2, RD3L is expressed in heart (the eye was not included
in IBA2) at relatively low levels, whereas RD3 is not observed at
all. A western blot was performed using antibodies raised against
RD3L revealing the bands at the expected size (Supplementary
Fig. S4). High expression of the protein in the mouse eye (vitre-
ous humor and retina) was conﬁrmed by immunoﬁuorescence
imaging (Supplementary Fig. S4). RD3L was not detected in
heart by either western blot or immunoﬁuorescence, a result pos-
sibly attributable to the lower levels of protein expression in that
tissue. Subsequent to our analysis, a predicted protein sequence
for RD3L was added to Uniprot.

We also identiﬁed a transcript, which within its ﬁrst intron
hosts the well-studied microRNAs let7e, miR-125 A and
miR-99B. This transcript, which we term LET 7EH (Let-7e
host), contains a 283-codon ORF (Fig. 60), which is conserved
in mammals and encodes immunoglobulin—like and transmem—
brane domains. This ORF was revealed by the identiﬁcation of a
previously unrecognized 5’ exon of NCRNA00085, which con-
tains a canonical start codon with a strong Kozak sequence, and
is supported by H3K4me3 peaks signaling transcription initi-
ation. The novel splice junction that encompasses the miRNAs
was conﬁrmed by PCR (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Our analysis revealed previously unannotated putative protein
products larger than 600 amino acids. This includes a protein
sequence with similarity (55% by BLASTP) to CROCC, a

structural component of the ciliary rootlet, which contributes
to centrosome cohesion before mitosis (Bahe et al., 2005), that
we term CROCC2 (Fig. 6b). CROCC2 encodes a 1480-amino
acid putative protein from a large conserved ORF adjacent to
SNEDI. Orthologs of CROCC2 are present in mammals and
amphibians, with both CROCC2 and SNEDI remaining adja-
cent in mouse. Similarly, we identiﬁed another transcript
expressed exclusively in testes that is predicted to encode a
638-amino acid protein with a helix—loop—helix DNA-binding
domain and HMG—box domain that is conserved in mammals.
The putative protein, which we term HMGDC (HMG domain
containing, Fig. 6d), incorporates the predicted and unreviewed
Uniprot entry C9JSJ3_HUMAN, adding two additional exons
that form the HMG—box domain.

Our Pinstripe analysis highlighted possible examples of under-
appreciated proteome complexity. For example, we identiﬁed a
transcript that overlaps with the protein-coding gene, FIP1L1,
that introduces a previously unknown ORF that is supported by
four pepFrags. The putative protein encoded by this alternate
reading frame, which we term FIPlLlARF (FlPlLl alternate
reading frame), is also predicted to contain a probable sig-
nal peptide (D-score=0.908, P=0.99) and a neuroendocrine
domain. Although such examples of multiple proteins originating
from different ORFs are rare with only a small number previ-
ously reported in mammals (Clark et al., 2007; Nekrutenko et al.,
2005), recent studies suggest this may be a much more common
phenomenon (Ingolia et al., 2011).

3.5 Non-coding, coding or dual function RNA

We examined 5325 transcripts (including isoforms) from the set
of RefSeq-annotated genes with no annotated CDS. Intersecting
these putatively non-coding transcripts with our uniquely map-
ping pepFrags identiﬁed 785 (14.7%) genes with pepFrags map-
ping within a canonical ORF, of which 341 had multiple
pepFrag support.

Although this analysis identiﬁes those genes that may be trans-
lated, the analysis of candidates without a CDS includes, in the
majority, genes whose classiﬁcation as non-coding is attributable
solely to a lack of evidence supporting translation. To classify
genes with demonstrated or purported non-coding function, we
analyzed 99 manually curated candidates from lncRNAdb
(Amaral et al., 2011) revealing that 10 of these non-coding genes
H19,HAR1A, MALA T1, TUGI, MEG3, HOTTIP, LOC285194,
ST 70 T, WT 1 -as and SOX 20T have isoforms with uniquely map-
ping pepFrags contained within canonical ORFs, although only
H19 and H19AS had three or more pepFrags, suggesting the
remainder are most likely false positives.

We selected four of the ncRNAs with pepFrag support, of
which two were well supported (H19 and an antisense transcript
to H19 and H19AS) and two poorly supported (MALA T1 and
T UGI), and created antibodies against the putative proteins. The
best supported of these was H19 with a large ORF (298 codons)
matching seven uniquely mapping pepFrags (Supplementary
Fig. S6). H19 was the ﬁrst long regulatory non-coding RNA
described in mammals, classiﬁed as non-coding because of the
absence of a detectable translated protein in mouse, along with
poor ORF conservation between mouse and human compared
with high overall DNA sequence identity (Brannan et al., 1990).

The RNA is thought to be bifunctional, acting as both a miRNA
and lncRNA (Smits et al., 2008).

Western blots revealed no bands at the expected size for
MALA T1 , T UG1 or H19AS, but the predicted ~26-kDa product
for H19 was identiﬁed in fetal liver, K562 cells and testes
(Supplementary Fig. S5a) and appears to localize to the cyto-
plasm of T47D breast cancer cells (Supplementary Fig. S5b). As
there is only limited evidence for H19 action as a regulatory
lncRNA (Runge et al., 2000; Zhao et al., 2010), its translation
suggests H19 is dual functional but possibly as a miRNA and
mRNA, rather than lncRNA and miRNA. Although we did not
successfully identify any of the other three candidates, H19AS
has subsequently been identiﬁed by others as encoding the pro-
tein HOTS (Onyango and Feinberg, 2011).

Although the lack of conﬁrmation for MALA T1 and TUG1
is unsurprising given the lack of quality controls on the PRIDE
peptide database, and only single pepFrag support, the protein-
coding evidence of H19 and HOTS supports the hypothesis
that the binary delineation of long RNA transcripts as either
ncRNA or mRNA is an oversimpliﬁcation, and that genes
may exhibit a range of protein-coding and non-coding function-
ality as either small ncRNAs, long ncRNAs, mRNAs or a com-
bination thereof (Dinger et al., 2011). On the other hand, the vast

majority of spliced transcripts from the IBA2 show no evidence
of translation after integrating current transcriptomic and prote-
omic datasets. A total of 44 843 loci were composed only of tran-
scripts that do not contain pepFrags, compared with 34 803 loci
with at least one transcript containing one or more pepFrags.
This result is consistent with recent datasets produced by
GENCODE (Becker, 2011).

4 DISCUSSION

Differentiating between ncRNA and mRNA is far from trivial,
with traditional strategies relying on characteristics or features of
known mRNAs such as codon conservation, ORF length or
homology. Such strategies are effective at identifying mRNA
that are well conserved, contain large canonical ORFs, are simi-
lar to known mRNA or encode known protein domains, but
less reliable for detecting small poorly conserved proteins
with speciﬁc non-redundant function. As a supplement to such
approaches, Pinstripe provides a suite of tools designed to inte-
grate and aggregate large sets of proteomic and transcriptomic
experimental data, providing not only new tools for the identiﬁ-
cation of RNA potentially encoding proteins but also for

Pinstripe: a suite of programs for integrating transcriptomic and proteomic datasets

 

integrating data from in silico genomic comparisons by existing
applications such as PhyloCSF, SignalP and IPRScan.

There is growing evidence that large numbers of RNAs with-
out well—conserved long canonical ORFs are actually translated.
For example, the Humanin genes encode short ORFs (24—30
amino acids) and are found only in humans (Hashimoto et al.,
2001); translation of upstream ORFs is a demonstrated regula-
tory mechanism (Baek et al., 2009; Wen et al., 2009), and
non-canonical start sites are common in mouse embryonic
stem cells (Ingolia et al., 2011). As a result, algorithms dependent
on ORF length, canonical start codons, conservation or syn-
onymous/non—synonymous substitution rates will not always be
sufﬁcient to identify and differentiate between coding and
non-coding genes. This is especially true in the case of short
proteins, which are challenging to identify as ORFs <100
codons regularly occur by chance (Dinger et al., 2008). As
other methods including conservation analysis and dinucleotide
content are only predictive and have shortcomings, the integra-
tion of experimental evidence supporting translation is often
required for conﬁdent annotation of novel proteins.

Pinstripe is designed to allow users to integrate any available
experimental data in the form of gene annotations, peptide iden-
tiﬁcations or external analyses using applications such as
PhyloCSF (Lin et al., 2011) or SignalP (Bendtsen et al., 2004).
Although Pinstripe is entirely dependent on the integrity of the
pepFrags, annotations and transcriptomes used for analysis,
users can adjust the thresholds for identiﬁcation to improve
the probability of correct classiﬁcation. The appropriate thresh-
olds will largely depend on the quality of the data, notably the
accuracy of pepFrag identiﬁcations. Most commonly, the pro-
cess of correctly identifying pepFrags from spectra relies on the
statistically robust concordance of the queried peptide fragment
with predicted spectra from a target database. Although using
pepFrags that have already been sequenced dramatically reduces
the computational task, the ﬁdelity of the original identiﬁcation
is lost. This can be addressed by pre—screening of spectra selecting
only those with a set level of conﬁdence, using peptides from
quality-controlled sources such as the PeptideAtlas (Deutsch
et al., 2008), or at the protein identiﬁcation stage by requiring
an increased number of coincident pepFrags, or other supporting
information such as conservation or functional prediction to
identify coding genes.

Our analysis of the IBA2 data demonstrates that application
of Pinstripe ’s programs accurately maps pepFrags and integrates
them with transcripts to identify supported ORFs and identiﬁes
RNA with little or no protein-coding capacity. Although not all
ORFs containing mapped pepFrags represent genuine
protein-coding genes, additional lines of evidence including
signal peptide potential, positive PhyloCSF scores and multiple
pepFrags identify potential protein-coding genes, including the
validated protein RD3LP, variants of GIPC3 and AAKI and a
protein translated from the putative ncRNA H19. Pinstripe
allows researchers to identify transcripts with little or no
protein-coding potential, and which have no pepFrags mapping
to putative ORFs, regardless of size. This is especially important,
as knowledge of whether a given transcript is coding or
non-coding will guide the design of any subsequent experimental
work to characterize its function.

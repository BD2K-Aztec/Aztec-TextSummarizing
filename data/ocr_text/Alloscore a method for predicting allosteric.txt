Abstract

Summary: Allosteric ligands have increasingly gained attention as potential therapeutic agents
due to their higher target selectivity and lower toxicity compared with classic orthosteric ligands.
Despite the great interest in the development of allosteric drugs as a new tactic in drug discovery,
the understanding of the ligand—protein interactions underlying allosteric binding represents a key
challenge. Herein, we introduce Alloscore, a web server that predicts the binding affinities of allo—
steric ligand—protein interactions. This method exhibits prominent performance in describing allo—
steric binding and could be useful in allosteric virtual screening and the structural optimization of

allosteric agonists/antagonists.

1 Introduction

Allostery, as a major regulatory mechanism, is of fundamental im-
portance in a wide variety of biological phenomena, including signal
transduction, catalysis and metabolism (Nussinov et 61]., 2011). The
functionality of allosteric proteins consists of their ability to orches—
trate the activity of orthosteric sites in response to a signal, which is
quintessentially fomented by effectors binding at distinct, often dis—
tant, functional sites, which are also referred to as allosteric sites
(Huang et 61]., 2013). Compared with orthosteric ligands, which target
highly conserved orthosteric sites, allosteric ligands can bind to any
evident suitable pockets on protein surfaces. Thus, allosteric ligands
are capable of discriminating between closely related proteins (e.g. re—
ceptors, protein kinases). This specific mode of action endows allo—
steric ligands with unparalleled advantages compared with orthosteric
ligands, including higher specificity, fewer side effects and lower tox—
icity (Nussinov and Tsai, 2013). Current drug discovery efforts under
pharmaceutical regimes are increasingly investing in allosteric ligands,

and structure—based drug design depends mainly on protein-ligand
interactions. In this regard, characterizing allosteric ligand—protein
interactions contributes to allosteric drug discovery (Huang et 61].,
2015; Lu et 61]., 2014; Panjkovich and Daura, 2014).

Despite the distinctive advantages shared by allosteric ligands,
the development of allosteric drugs remains daunting, due to the
special binding modes of allosteric ligand—protein interactions com—
pared with orthosteric ligand—protein interactions. Recent studies
have pinpointed conspicuous differences between the physicochemi—
cal properties of allosteric and orthosteric ligands (Wang et 61].,
2012; Nussinov and Tsai, 2014). Allosteric ligands are generally
more lipophilic and more rigid compounds than orthosteric ligands,
which suggests that current universal computational algorithms are
incapable of effectively portraying the associations of allosteric lig—
ands with proteins. Thus, there is a pressing need for the develop—
ment of a novel method to assess the binding affinities of unique
allosteric ligand—protein interactions.

Detailed information is described in the Supplemental Tables 81 and $4

In this study, we introduce Alloscore, a web server that predicts
the binding affinities of allosteric ligand—protein interactions, for the
first time. This method elaborately selects a subset of energy terms
that are best suited to delineate the characteristics of allosteric bind-
ing. Alloscore exhibits good performance in dissecting allosteric
binding and could be useful in allosteric virtual screening and struc-
tural optimization of allosteric agonists/antagonists.

2 Methods

The most recent version of ASD (v3.0, July 2015), (Shen et al.,
2016) containing experimentally determined allosteric complexes
with binding affinity, was utilized to develop the method for the af-
finity prediction of allosteric ligand—protein interactions. Based on
knowledge from our previous analyses (Li et al., 2013; Wang et al.,
2012), a subset of energy terms that is best suited to delineate the
characteristics of allosteric binding affinities was selected. Then, the
predicted model of allosteric binding affinity was trained and tested,
and a final model was deployed on the Alloscore web server.
Detailed information about the process of model construction is
provided in the Supplementary Information.

3 Results

Using six selected energy terms (van de Waals, hydrogen bond and
hydrophobic interactions between allosteric ligands and proteins,
rotatable bonds in allosteric ligands and the buried volume and
polar surfaces of ligands when binding to allosteric sites) and the ex-
perimental pK, values of the training set complexes, Alloscore was
trained as an empirical linear regression model for evaluating allo-
steric protein-ligand binding affinities. The regression resulted in a
value of 0.647 for Pearson’s correlation coefficient, R (Rp)
(Supplementary Table 81 and Fig. 81), which is superior to available

popular binding prediction methods for the training set
(Supplementary Fig. S2). The interpretation of the Alloscore model
is straightforward based on coefficient signs and weights
(Supplementary Table S2). Hydrophobicity (45.16%), the buried
ligand volume (18.70%) and rotatable bonds (15.83%) represent
the three most important energy term contributions for allosteric
interactions in the model (Supplementary Table S2), which is in
good agreement with previous analyses of allosteric ligands and sites
(Li et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012). To provide a more realistic esti-
mate of the actual model performance, Alloscore was evaluated
with an external test set in comparison with other methods. The re-
sult show that Alloscore clearly outperforms other methods in the
prediction of allosteric protein—ligand binding affinities (Fig. 1), re-
sulting in values of 0.764 and 0.800 for Rp and Spearman’s R (Rs),
respectively (Supplementary Table Sl). Therefore, the specific model
of Alloscore is expected to improve allosteric drug design and opti-
mization in real-world scenario applications.

3.1 Usage and output
For each job, the user can specify allosteric complexes of interest by
uploading a protein in a PDB file and multiple ligands in an M012 file
under ‘Base Structure’. After defining the query protein and ligands, a
‘Job Name’ must be set before submission, which will allow the users
to locate their queries in the ‘Job Queue’. Once the run is submitted, a
unique Job ID appears on the submission page. The users can apply
this Job ID or Job Name to track the job’s status or to access results
on the Alloscore ‘Job Queue’ page. Upon completion of a job, a but-
ton labeled ‘Finished’ emerges in the ‘Job Queue’. A representative
run of an Allosite job takes 15—30 5, depending on both the number of
input ligands and the complexity of the input protein.

Clicking the ‘Finished’ button links to the result, which includes
the predicted energy terms, binding affinity and interactive 3D repre-
sentation of each allosteric ligand—protein complex (Supplementary

4 Conclusion

The Alloscore web server conveniently provides a user—friendly
interface to predict the binding affinities of allosteric ligand—protein
interactions. Furthermore, critical energy contributions that contrib—
ute to allosteric binding are offered. To the best of our knowledge,
this web server is the first of its kind and will be of considerable
value to scientists interested in allosteric drug design and screening.

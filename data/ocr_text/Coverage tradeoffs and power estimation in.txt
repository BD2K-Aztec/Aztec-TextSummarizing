ABSTRACT

Motivation: Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) allows direct
interrogation of previously undetected uncommon or rare variants,
which potentially contribute to the missing heritability of human
disease. However, cost of sequencing large numbers of samples
limits its application in case—control association studies. Here, we
describe theoretical and empirical design considerations for such
sequencing studies, aimed at maximizing the power of detecting
association under the constraint of study-wide cost.

Results: We consider two cost regimes. First, assuming cost is
proportional to the total amount of base pairs to be sequenced
across all samples, which is a practical model for whole-genome
sequencing, we explored the tradeoff in terms of study power
between increasing the number of subjects and increasing depth
coverage. We demonstrate that the optimal power of detecting
association is achieved at medium depth coverage under a wide
range of realistic conditions for case-only sequencing designs.
Second, if cost is fixed per sample, which is approximately the
case in exome sequencing, we show that in a simple case+control
sequencing study, the optimal design should include cases totaling
1/e of all subjects.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have greatly improved
our understanding of the genetics of human diseases (Altshuler et al.,
2008). However, for the majority of common diseases, substantial
fractions of heritability remain to be explained. Rare variants, which
are under the radar of GWAS, are suggested to have signiﬁcant
contributions to missing heritability (Eichler et al., 2010; Frazer
et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2010).

Complete ascertainment of rare variants requires genome—wide
resequencing, which is now feasible thanks to the development
of next—generation sequencing technologies (Bentley et al., 2008).
Exome sequencing (Ng et al., 2009) and whole—genome sequencing
(WGS) (Lupski et al., 2010) have been successfully applied to

identify rare causal variants of Mendelian diseases. In these studies,
a causal gene was implicated if it harbors rare functional mutations
that are shared among cases but absent in controls or single
nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) databases. Extending this approach
to association studies of complex diseases requires more than a
handful of samples, because the causal variants of such conditions
only have statistical effect (Cohen et al., 2006). Therefore, it is
necessary to carefully consider the design of such studies under
the constraint of limited resources.

A critical technical attribute of WGS data is the number of times
each site is observed in a sequencing read, usually termed the depth—
of—coverage. Depth—of—coverage is a key determinant of quality
for sequencing information, and in particular, w.r.t. rare variants.
Accuracy and completeness of detection and calling such variants
from sequencing depend on high depth—of—coverage, due to the
randomness of read placement (Lander and Waterman, 1998) and
non—negligible error rate (Mckernan et al., 2009). Higher depth
coverage for variant discovery and genotyping is attainable by
using more sequencing resources (e. g. Illumina lanes) per sequenced
sample. However, given a ﬁxed budget, more sequencing per sample
is in conﬂict with analyzing a large sample size, which is required
for adequate statistical power of detecting associations. Here, we
propose to resolve this tradeoff by ﬁnding the design that maximizes
the power for detecting associations of rare variants. We deﬁne rare
variants as the ones with minor allele frequency (MAF) < 1% in the
population, and uncommon variants as the ones with MAF between
1 and 5%. Here, we use the term rare variants to include both rare
and uncommon variants.

2 METHODS AND RESULTS

2.1 Sequencing cases with cost proportional to total
bases

We ﬁrst assume a cost regime where the overhead cost of a subject is
negligible comparing to that of the sequenced bases. Under ﬁxed total
cost and therefore affordable total bases (T) is ﬁxed, genome—wide average
depth coverage A is determined by the number of cases to be sequenced
(N1) : A = T /N 1. For a rare variant, we assume homozygous carriers are rare
enough to be ignored. The power of correctly calling a heterozygous carrier
from sequencing data is a function of A :R(A), usually with an approximate
sigmoid. It can be determined from empirical data (Supplementary Fig. S 1) 0r
approximated analytically (Wendl and Wilson, 2009; Wheeler er al., 2008).

Allelic heterogeneity is likely to be ubiquitous among genes that harbor
causal rare variants (Bodmer and Bonilla, 2008; Pritchard, 2001). Grouping
rare variants according to genes or pathways they disrupt for association
testing (Price et al., 2010) is necessary to increase power. For simplicity, we

assuming T=1000><, N02400, K020 and Q25 x 10‘6. Different
horizontal lines represent power assuming different case carrier frequencies
(F 1), with solid black, solid red, solid blue, dashed blue and dashed black
representing F1 =0.05,0.075,0.1,0.125 and 0.15, respectively. The unit on
the top x—axis is average depth coverage corresponding to the number of
cases.

consider a gene as disrupted in a sample if it harbors any of the causal
variants, and use the collapsing method (Li and Leal, 2008) to test the
association.

In the presence of allelic heterogeneity, we assume there are M rare
causal variants within a gene (or pathway). These alleles are independently
distributed in the population, with respective carrier frequencies hl, ..., hM
among cases. The carrier status for any of these rare variants is a Bernoulli
variable with compound carrier frequency p=R(A)(1—]_[?1:1(1—h,-)) in
cases. Let F1 EZf-Lhi, then p%F1R(A) when It,- << 1, and the number of
observed carriers K1 among N1 cases follows a binomial distribution with
parameters (N1,F1R(A)). An economic design is to sequence cases only and
utilize publicly available data for additional N0 samples as controls. For
example, we use N0 2400, which represents a lower bound of the sample
size from one major population of the 1000 Genomes Project (1000 Genomes
Project Consortium et al., 2010). Given T ,N0,F1 and R(A), we provide an
online tool (OPERA) that can calculate the power of detecting association
from different values of N1 (and A) under certain Type I error cutoff (Q).
As an example, we show the results with resources of T = 1000>< genomes
under a simplistic assumption that the number of carriers in controls (K0) is
0 (Fig. 1). The power curve takes the unusual shape of a sawtooth wave that
reﬂects discrete artifacts (Supplementary Material) of the test statistics for
association of rare variants (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3), superimposed
on a smoothed concave curve through the respective tips of the sawteeth.
Moving along the x—axis, the smoothed curve initially increases with N1
when N1 is relatively small, reﬂecting the fact that when N1 is small, A is
large, therefore R(A) is close to 1 and changes very little as N1 increases.
For larger sample sizes and lower coverage, where R(A) is away from 1,
increasing N1 further reduces A and R(A) sufﬁciently to negate the beneﬁt
of increasing N1, thus power starts to decrease from one sawtooth tip to the
next. We present similar results with K0 2 1 (Supplementary Fig. S4a), which
can represent singleton variants in controls sequenced at low coverage. In
general, for a gene with compound carrier frequency F 0 of rare functional
variants in controls, the expected power is the sum of power under possible
K0 values weighted by the probability of observing K0. We show the power
curve with hypothetical F0 20.001 (Supplementary Fig. S4b).

2.2 Fixed sequencing cost per case or control sample,
sequencing both cases and controls

The other cost regime is where per—sample overhead is large enough to be
approximated as ﬁxed cost regardless of coverage, which is approximately
the case for practical exome sequencing. The budget then translates to a
total number of subjects to be sequenced. The remaining decision for the
investigator is what fraction of these subjects should be cases versus controls.

While variants may be partially penetrant, either causal or protective (Neale
et al., 2011; Yi and Zhi, 2011), a simplifying assumption of gene disruptions
to be fully penetrant and causal is helpful both in practical exome sequencing
(Ng et al., 2009) as well as for theoretical analysis: we prove (Supplementary
Material) that in such scenarios the optimal ratio of cases to all samples is
1 : e (e is the base of the natural logarithm). If disruptions are to be sought
in both cases and control without bias, this asymmetry breaks, and naturally
one needs to sequence a similar number of subjects from either group.

3 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSIONS

We discussed optimal designs of association studies focused on
rare variants using high—throughput resequencing under budget
constraint. Under a scenario where the cost is proportional to the
total number of sequenced bases and only sequencing cases, there
are two important characteristics of the optimal design under a
constant budget. First, the curve of power versus the number of
cases is not smooth, but resembles a sawtooth. Second and more
importantly, smoothing the sawtooth tips, the maximum power of
detecting associations is achieved at a medium coverage (A) where
the power of calling heterozygous variants R(A) from sequencing
data is suboptimal. Under a second scenario where the cost is
proportional to the number of subjects, when assuming sequencing
both cases and controls for detecting case—only disruptions, the
optimal fraction of cases among sequenced subjects is 1/e.

Our analysis of the optimal design assumes using simple
collapsing method to test the association of rare variants in the
presence of allelic heterogeneity. Although some other methods are
better powered under certain conditions (Madsen et al., 2009; Neale
et al., 2011; Price et al., 2010; Yi and Zhi, 2011), the collapsing
method is often the ﬁrst statistical test researchers conduct after
getting new data. Moreover, it has been showed to be empirically
adequate in practice when combined with appropriate functional
assessment of the variants (Cohen et al., 2006; Surolia et al., 2010).
Our power calculator assumes this test following to traditional
calculations that typically focus on a basic scenario and test, rather
than a full probabilistic model.

We have implemented a web tool for computing the power under
a ﬂexible set of assumptions considering the general cost regime,
where both a ﬁxed, per—sample cost and a variable, per coverage
price are accrued. This tool could provide investigators means to plan
experiments in the practical regimes of budgets and technologies
they are facing within their institutions.

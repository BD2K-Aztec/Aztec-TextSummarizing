Abstract

Summary: Protein—protein interaction networks are an important component of modern systems
biology. Yet, comparatively few efforts have been made to tailor their topology to the actual cellular
condition being studied. Here, we present a network construction method that exploits expression
data at the transcript—level and thus reveals alterations in protein connectivity not only caused by
differential gene expression but also by alternative splicing. We achieved this by establishing a dir—
ect correspondence between individual protein interactions and underlying domain interactions in
a complete but condition—unspecific protein interaction network. This knowledge was then used to
infer the condition—specific presence of interactions from the dominant protein isoforms. When we
compared contextualized interaction networks of matched normal and tumor samples in breast
cancer, our transcript—based construction identified more significant alterations that affected
proteins associated with cancerogenesis than a method that only uses gene expression data. The
approach is provided as the user—friendly tool PPIXpress.

1 Introduction

Protein—protein interaction networks (PPIN) are an important pillar
of data integration in computational biology and have been used in
a large number of studies and approaches. Generally, such networks
are collections of physical interactions between pairs of proteins
compiled from different experiments (Vidal et 61]., 2011).

Full PPINs provide a convenient overview of the interactome of
an organism. Yet, they do not reflect the true wiring exhibited by
the cell in a specific state, because an interaction can only be realized
if both partners are available. Pruning the full network to the set of
proteins whose genes are expressed in the same condition has proven
to be a straightforward solution for this. This allowed investigating
the interaction landscape across tissues (Bossi and Lehner, 2009;
Lopes et 61]., 2011; Sinha and Nagarajaram, 2014) as well as the

origin of tissue—specific diseases (Barshir et 61]., 2014). Furthermore,
it improved the prediction of disease genes (Magger et 61]., 2012).

An estimated 95% of human multi—exon genes undergo alterna—
tive splicing (AS) (Pan et 61]., 2008) and the specific isoform of a pro—
tein was shown to have a considerable impact on its ability to bind
interaction partners (Buljan et 61]., 2012; Ellis et 61]., 2012; Miederer
et 61]., 2015). Thanks to the ability of quantifying individual tran-
scripts nowadays, it thus appears worthwhile to also increase the
granularity of condition—specific networks to this resolution.

Domain—domain interaction networks (DDIN) depict inter—
actions between individual protein domains and provide a conveni—
ent framework to relate interaction sites with sequence information.
In contrast to models based on atomistic structural data, DDINs
allow for universal applicability (Ozawa et 61]., 2010; Ma et 61].,

2012; Will and Helms, 2014). So far, the only methodical effort re—
garding the effect of AS on interaction networks is found in the
Cytoscape 2.x plugin DomainGraph. When linked to the AS analysis
tool AltAnalyze, DomainGraph can highlight protein domains in
DDINs that are affected by differential exon usage (Emig et 61].,
2010). However, this tool is intended for visual exploration. While
the user can manually estimate the implications of respective
changes as PPIN and DDIN are visualized together, the tool does
not allow to automatically infer conclusions for the PPIN on a
whole—proteome scale.

With PPIXpress, we aim here at providing a simple standalone
solution for the automatic construction of condition—specific protein
interaction networks based on domain information and transcript
expression. In addition to this core functionality, the tool is able to
retrieve current protein interaction data, to add functional associ—
ation scores from the STRING database (Szklarczyk et 61]., 2015) to
unweighted networks, and it can output the underlying condition—
specific DDIN for each sample. It allows the usage of compressed in—
put files in the gzip—format and is well—suited for batch—processing.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 PPIXpress

The input data for PPIXpress consists of a reference PPIN with
condition—unspecific interactions and at least one sample of
transcript— or gene—level expression data. From that, the tool con—
structs the condition—specific subnetworks for each transcriptome.
Thus each network only comprises those interactions from the refer-
ence that are considered active in the sample.

Networks can be provided in the simple input format (either
interacting UniProt, HGNC or Ensembl gene pairs line-by-line, op-
tionally with a weight) or can alternatively be retrieved from IntAct
(Orchard et 61]., 2014) for a certain organism. The current version
supports expression data in the following formats: Cufflinks FPKM
files (Trapnell et 61]., 2010), GENCODE or comparable Ensembl—
annotated GTF files (Harrow et 61]., 2006), TCGA RNASeq data or
textfiles with expression—levels per line as commonly exported by
popular R—based tools. All other data sources that are used intern—
ally are automatically retrieved in their most current versions.
Furthermore, the user may optionally change the expression thresh—
old (absolute or percentile—based) that is applied, limit the analysis
to the gene—level, or inquire specific versions of retrieved data.

The basic principle of PPIXpress is outlined in Figure 1 and will
be explained in the following paragraphs. Details regarding the an—
notation with domain data and datasets are covered in Section 2.2.

2.1.1 Relating protein and domain interactions

In the initial mapping stage, a one—to—at—least—one relationship be—
tween interactions in the given PPIN and the corresponding DDIN is
established such that all PPIs found in the reference PPIN should be
supported by at least one underlying DDI. In this step, PPIXpress
considers the longest isoform of each protein as its representative in
the DDIN, because large—scale experimental analyses and most data—
bases usually declare it as the principal variant (Talavera et 61].,
2013; Rodriguez et 61]., 2013). Hence, the annotated domain com—
positions of the longest isoforms are used to construct a network on
the domain—level that is then related to the reference PPIN.
According to a dataset of feasible interactions between domain types
(see Section 2.2), edges between interacting domains of distinct pro-
teins are established in the DDIN if the protein pair is also connected
in the PPIN. Thereby, it is noted which DDI or which DDIs support

ll. contextualization

Fig. 1. The PPIXpress approach can be divided into two stages. Initially, com-
plete PPIN and DDIN are related to each other, whereby artificial domains
(here shown in green) may be introduced to ensure a complete connectivity
on the domain-level. This correspondence is then used to filter sample-spe-
cific domain—domain interactions (DDI) derived from transcript expression
data and to map these back to the supported protein—protein interactions
(PPI). The details are covered in the main text. Proteins without any expressed
transcripts, as well as domains that are not found in the most abundant tran-
script are shown translucent. In this example, a method that only uses gene
expression data would miss the disappearance of the protein interaction
shown as a red dashed horizontal line in the top right picture

each individual interaction between proteins in the network because
different DDIs may ratify the same PPI on this level.

If a protein interaction cannot be assigned to any domain inter—
action at this stage, we add artificial domains to the affected pro—
teins. Those domains are utilized to also establish links in the DDIN
between those interaction partners in the reference PPIN whose
binding cannot be explained otherwise by available domain inter—
action data. Introduction of such artificial domains allows our ap—
proach to sustain a complete correspondence between the two
network—layers. Adding fictitious protein domains to overcome the
sparsity of domain—level data was introduced before to improve the
performance of protein complex prediction approaches that make
use of such data (Ma et 61]., 2012; Will and Helms, 2014). While Ma
et al. (2012) introduced this idea in a non—deterministic way,
PPIXpress uses a deterministic approach as described in Will and
Helms (2014). These non—physical domains are thought to be pre—
sent in every transcript coding for the protein and thus implement
the behavior of gene—based methods where domain—level annotation
fails to explain the protein—level outcome. This way, the method—
ology guarantees a seemless and safe transition to the performance
of the gene—level approach whenever available data coverage on
DDIs cannot explain the macroscopic observation.

2. 1.2 Condition-specific construction
After the sample—independent mapping step, the expression data is
incorporated to contextualize the network. Initially, all transcripts
above a user—defined threshold are determined for the specific ex-
pression sample. From those, only the most abundant transcript of
each protein is chosen to build a sample—specific DDIN, whereas all
others are neglected. Based on this specific DDIN derived from the
expression data and the previously determined mapping of DDIs to
PPIs, a specific PPIN is constructed that only contains interactions
that are supported by domain—level evidence. Here, it is not import-
ant if an individual PPI is backed by one or several DDIs; the exist—
ence of a single support is sufficient.

Viewed differently, PPIXpress used with transcript data first
prunes the reference PPIN in a node—specific manner such as the es—
tablished methods that are based on gene expression, but

additionally trims the network in an edge—specific way guided by the
domain data. The resulting network is therefore always a subnet—
work of one obtained from a construction method based one gene
expression. Figure 1 shows an example for this (red dashed inter—
action). These additionally considered ‘edgetic’ changes, as they are
called in recent literature, are increasingly thought to be of crucial
importance for phenotypic traits (Zhong et 61]., 2009; Sahni et 61].,
2013, 2015). If PPIXpress is switched to the gene—level mode all
genes with expressed transcripts (or all above the threshold if only
gene expression data is given) are taken into account. The longest
coding transcript, the same reference as in the initial mapping, is se-
lected as the representative of the protein. Thus the gene—level be—
havior is replicated while the specific DDINs are also reported.

Although data and methodology would in principle allow to pro—
cess the contribution of a weighted ensemble of transcripts at this
stage, we decided to introduce the strong assumption to discard all
but the most abundant transcripts per protein. On the one hand,
there is increasing biological evidence that generally only one dom—
inant transcript per gene acts as the main contributor in a cellular
condition (Gonzalez—Porta et 61]., 2013; Ezkurdia et 61]., 2015; Mele
et 61]., 2015). On the other hand, quantifying the distribution would
require several additional parameters that may render the model un—
necessarily complex and consequently the tool less appealing to the
user. The discretization thus equally satisfies biological as well as
practical considerations.

2.2 PPIXpress: datasets and protocols

2.2.1 Protein interaction networks

Self—interactions between proteins are not considered by PPIXpress
because they interfere with classical types of network analysis such
as complex prediction or disease gene prioritization. Furthermore, if
the input PPIN is annotated with one of the non—UniProt accessions,
they are converted using the HGNC webservice or Biomart
(Smedley et 61]., 2015), depending on the identifiers at hand.

2.2.2 Domain annotations

Internally, the tool queries UniProt (Bateman et 61]., 2015) to infer
the organism that is dealt with from the network data. With this
knowledge, all required annotation data is retrieved from the appro—
priate and most recent Ensembl database (Cunningham et 61]., 2015 )
by MySQL queries. The data comprise the relations between pro—
teins, transcripts and genes, but also the assignment of resulting pro—
tein domains to transcripts. Only transcripts that can be directly
associated to Swiss—Prot proteins are considered.

PPIXpress uses domain annotations derived from the manually
curated Pfam—A database (Finn et 61]., 2014b). Pfam domains in
Ensembl are detected for each transcript individually using
InterProScan (Jones et 61]., 2014) and are automatically updated
with every new release. As Pfam—A domains are non-overlapping
and have predetermined family—specific detection thresholds that are
used by InterProScan to filter for matches, neither additional param-
eters nor any postprocessing are needed within PPIXpress for this
step (Finn et 61]., 2010). Moreover, queries and internal data
structures are designed to reﬂect the repeated occurrence of the
same domain type within a protein in the optionally returned sam-
ple—specific DDINs.

2.2.3 Domain interaction data

To provide a comprehensive knowledgebase of physical interactions
between protein domain types with PPIXpress, we precompiled
high-confidence domain interaction data from DOMINE

(Yellaboina et 61]., 2011) and IDDI (Kim et 61]., 2012). Both are inte—
grated databases that assign reliability estimations to their available
datasets. In DOMINE (version 2.0) interactions were classified into
disjoint categories according to their estimated confidence. In IDDI
(release May 2011) numerical confidence values were assigned to
each interaction. As those primary resources appear not to be
updated anymore, we additionally integrated automatic retrieval of
current data from the 3did (Mosca et 61]., 2014) and inam (Finn et
61]., 2014a) databases whose interaction data is exclusively inferred
and automatically updated from the RCSB Protein Data Bank
(Berman et 61]., 2000).

By default, PPIXpress uses a high—confidence subset of DOMINE
and IDDI (see definition of PREHC in Section 2.3.4) expanded by
the most recent 3did/inam data. Interactions between domains of
the same type are taken into account if they are annotated.

2.3 Evaluation: datasets and protocols

2.3.1 Protein interaction networks

Data of experimentally determined physical interactions between
proteins in human (H. sapiens, taxon 9606), mouse (M. musculus,
taxon 10090), fruit ﬂy (D. melanogaster, taxon 7227) and yeast
(S. cerevisiae 5288c, taxon 559292) were retrieved from IntAct (re-
lease 189) (Orchard et 61]., 2014) using PPIXpress. For human we
additionally compiled a second PPIN from physical interactions be—
tween human proteins in BioGRID (release 3.3.124) (Chatr—
Aryamontri et 61]., 2015 ). Here, a conversion to UniProt accessions
was carried out using mapping data from HGNC (Gray et 61]., 2015 )
that was downloaded on May 5., 2015 .

2.3.2 Expression data

For the case study, transcript expression data for breast cancer
(BRCA) was retrieved from TCGA (Koboldt et 61]., 2012) as level 3
Illumina HiSeq—RNASeq V2 data based on RSEM quantification (Li
and Dewey, 2011) and filtered to the portion of 112 matched nor-
mal/tumor samples (last updated January 14, 2015 ).

Since it is a common threshold across popular RNA—seq quantifi—
cation methods (Diez et 61]., 2014; Barshir et 61]., 2014; Sinha and
Nagarajaram, 2014), by default all transcripts (or genes if only gene
expression data is given) with an abundance value above 1.0 are
considered as expressed in PPIXpress. For the case study we also
used this standard threshold.

2.3.3 Domain annotations
For all conducted analyses we used data from Ensembl release 79.

2.3.4 Domain interaction data

To evaluate the potential inﬂuence of the DDI dataset on the results,
we compiled different subsets of data from the aforementioned sour—
ces (see Section 2.2.3): PREHC only contained those interactions
from DOMINE that were inferred from structure or within the cat—
egory of highest—confidence predictions and those interactions from
IDDI whose confidence values exceed a threshold associated with an
accuracy of 90% in the benchmarks of their original publication.
PREVHC is a subset of PREHC that was restricted to the experimen—
tally known interactions in DOMINE and the portion of IDDI
that achieved the highest accuracy of 98% in Kim et al. (2012).
3did/inam contains the retrieved data from these two
structure—based databases and ALL—DDI denotes the merged dataset
PREHC U 3did/inam. All conducted analyses were based on data
from inam version 1.0 and 3did version 2015_02. Table 1 outlines
the respective sizes of the four DDI datasets used.

2.3.5 Whole-genome rewiring of protein interaction networks

For all 1 12 cases in TCGA with matched BRCA data from both nor—
mal and tumor tissue from the same patient, we constructed condi—
tion-specific protein interaction networks for both states and
counted the changes in every comparison across all matched sam—
ples. To keep track of the changes within the interactome we
marked each interaction that was only observable in the network of
the disease sample as positive count and those that appeared only in
the network of the healthy sample as negative. Figure 2 illustrates
the overall approach for the network construction and comparison.
For the evaluation the networks were constructed with PPIXpress
using different methodologies and data. All steps were assessed for
all settings individually. To obtain comparable abundance thresh—
olds for protein precursors in all methods, a gene was considered to
be abundant if at least one of its transcripts was abundant in a given
dataset.

Besides noting the changes across all samples, a rewiring prob—
ability Prew per interaction was individually computed for each
matched sample pair and then averaged over all samples. Pm,W was
approximated as the number of rewiring events (interactions
added —1— interactions removed between samples) divided by the num—
ber of interactions in normal or tumor, whichever was smaller. Since
such differential networks summarized over all matched samples
will inevitably contain many changes that occur only in few patients,
we added a filtering step. On the basis of Pm,W a one—tailed binomial
test was applied to check how likely it was to observe a certain num—
ber of rewiring events of an individual interaction over all samples
by chance. P—values were adjusted using Benjamini—Hochberg
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995) and only the interactions with ad—
justed p—values below 0.05 were retained.

2.3.6 Randomized implementation of PPIXpress

To assess the assumption that only the most abundant transcript of
each protein contributes to the specific DDIN (see Section 2.1.2), we
modified PPIXpress to randomly select any of the transcripts above
the expression threshold for each protein instead. For this random—
ized implementation we repeated the evaluation of the case study
100 times. As the construction method was applied to 112 X 2 sam-
ples (all matched pairs) per iteration during that process and the
variance among the results was quite low, we think 100 iterations
were sufficient for this comparison. Since the ALL—DDI dataset was
used with the randomized method it is referred to as
RANDOM(ALL-DDI) in the following tables.

2.3.7 ‘Hallmarks of cancer’ data and analysis

We associated proteins with 10 currently established hallmarks of
cancer on the basis of a handcrafted list of relevant GO terms by
Suzuki et al. (2014). We retrieved all proteins in human with such
an annotation using QuickGO (Binns et 61]., 2009) on May 5, 2015.
Associations inferred from automatic annotation (GO evidence IEA)
were discarded as those are often inferred from protein interactions.
A protein interaction was associated with a hallmark term if at least
one of its involved proteins was part of the corresponding set of hall—
mark proteins.

Fig.2. For all matched BRCA samples from TCGA we built protein interaction
networks using different methodologies. d1 to d112 denote changes in top-
ology between normal and tumor interaction network in each matched pair.
These differences were determined in every single patient and summed up in
a differential network shown at the bottom. Here, the interaction between pro-
teins A and B, for example, disappeared for all three shown matched sample
pairs. Thus the edge between A and B is annotated with —3 in the differential
network shown at the bottom

2.3.8 Enrichment analysis

Enrichment analysis was performed using DAVID 6.7 (Huang et 61].,
2009). We specifically checked for enriched KEGG pathways
(Kanehisa et 61]., 2014) and GO biological processes (Blake et 61].,
2015 ), set the proteins included in the respective input network as
the background and kept the default settings of DAVID otherwise.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Coverage of DDI datasets in practice

We first examined how many protein interactions are typically sup—
ported by at least one non—artificial domain interaction in the map-
ping stage of PPIXpress (interaction coverage) and how many
proteins have domain annotations that contribute to that (protein
coverage). We did this across various reference PPINs of several or—
ganisms and on the basis of different high—confidence DDI datasets
as described in Section 2.3.4.

The results are shown in Table 2. In all cases, a larger dataset
allowed to relate a larger part of the reference protein interactions
to known domain interactions. PREHC, for example, contained
around 2.4 times as many DDIs as 3did/inam (compare respective
columns in Table 1) and could relate 2.3—4.8 times more PPIs to
DDIs depending on the reference network examined (compare
PREHC and 3did/inam in Table 2). The addition of recent structural
data from 3did/inam to the precompiled integrated dataset only led
to a small improvement in interaction coverage (for all networks
consistently below 1%, compare ALL-DDI and PREHC in Table 2).
The human interactomes had the best coverage of interactions for
all DDI data examined. However, even in the best case, still only
about half of the proteins and roughly a fourth of the interactions
could be associated with supporting domain information at all.
Since the density of the PPINs was very heterogeneous (avg. degrees
ranged from 2.2 to 12.7, see Table 2), the ratio of proteome and

Contributing proteins are all proteins that had at least one annotated domain that was used to span the DDIN in the mapping stage of PPIXpress. Matched

PPIs are all PPIs that could be related to at least one DDI at this stage. The degree of a protein is the number of interaction partners in the respective network.

interactome coverage is not meaningful across networks.
Interestingly, the coverage of proteins associated with hallmarks of
cancer was higher than those of non-hallmark proteins
(Supplementary Tables S1/S2).

Whereas this analysis suggests that the partial coverage of do—
main annotation may reduce the value of the proposed approach, it
emphasizes the importance of a ﬂexible approach that is able to inte—
grate both well and poorly annotated proteins seamlessly. What are
the reasons for that tenuous coverage? While the vast majority of
proteins in human and yeast are annotated with at least one Pfam
domain (Mistry et 61]., 2013), even in our largest dataset only 7449
of the 14 831 domain types in Pfam 27.0 (Finn et 61]., 2014b) have
known domain interactions. Aside from the fact that some domain
types may not be meant to facilitate protein interactions anyhow,
experimental coverage of domain interactions is still sparse and not
expected to near completion in the near future (Yellaboina et 61].,
2011; Goncearenco et 61]., 2014). Even if data on actual interactions
was more comprehensive, respective binding interfaces have to be
related to conserved protein building blocks of any kind to make the
data universally applicable. However, interactions can also be medi—
ated by disordered regions between domains (Dunker et 61]., 2005)
which are difficult to account for by a general annotation scheme as
Pfam and are underrepresented there (Mistry et 61]., 2013). This is,
for example, the case for the pluripotency transcription factor Oct4
(Esch et 61]., 2013).

3.2 Case study: rewiring of protein interactions in

breast cancer

Since deregulation of splicing factors and accompanying alterations
in protein products are known to contribute to tumorigenesis
(David and Manley, 2010; Venables et 61]., 2009; Danan—Gotthold et
61]., 2015), transcript—based network construction may benefit an
analysis in that context. Thus we present as a case study a compari—
son of the changes in the interactome between matched healthy and
tumor samples from 112 breast cancer patients as explained in
Section 2.3.5 that we conducted with different network construction
approaches.

In cancer, changes in the interaction network can be expected to
include proteins that are associated with certain hallmarks of cancer
and that are frequently found in biological processes and pathways
related to cancerogenesis. Based on this assumption we assessed
whether the transcript—based methodology of PPIXpress was advan—
tageous to the established gene—based network adjustment and to
what extent selecting particular DDI datasets influenced the results.

Moreover, we examined the effect of our decision to exclusively
rely on the domain annotation of the most abundant transcript
above the threshold for each protein (see Section 2.1.2). To evaluate
this, we randomized the transcript selection in PPIXpress as

explained in Section 2.3.6. On average only 1.55 i 0.038 transcripts
were expressed per protein of the BioGRID network in each sample
and 1.58 i 0.040 in IntAct. Unsurprisingly, the number of discrete
domain assemblies among those expressed transcripts was even
smaller (Supplementary Tables S3/S4) and they mostly resembled
the domain composition of the longest—coding transcript
(Supplementary Tables S5/S6), since the principal domain compos—
ition often remains consistent among different isoforms (Ezkurdia et
al., 2012).

An overview of the network sizes during the construction phase
and some statistics are provided in Supplementary Tables S7—S9.
Using either gene— or transcript—based filtering of the input PPIN, the
normal to tumor conversion was accompanied with a net loss of
around 130—150 proteins and 900—1200 interactions, depending on
the reference PPIN (compare respective rows in Supplementary
Tables S7/S8). In line with expectations, the networks constructed
by the gene—based approach were always the largest ones and had
on average around 20 proteins and 800 interactions more than net—
works built from transcript data using the ALL—DDI dataset, for
example. Furthermore, the sizes of networks built using transcript—
based approaches slightly decreased with the amount of DDI data
involved (compare columns in Supplementary Tables S7/S8 and see
Supplementary Table S9 for a statistical evaluation). Networks con—
structed with transcript resolution and the largest dataset ALL-DDI
possessed on average around 10 proteins and 450 interactions less
than those built using the smallest dataset PREVHC. Both observa—
tions can be accounted for by the subnetwork property of our tran—
script—based construction that we explained in Section 2.1.2. Since
the sizes of the constructed networks were similar to results by
Barshir et al. (2014) who considered 12 669 protein—coding genes to
be expressed in healthy breast tissue, we deem our expression
threshold to be suitable. Independently of DDI data considered, all
transcript—based methods detected more rewiring events across the
individual matched sample pairs and overall a higher number of sig-
nificant changes in interactions compared to the gene—based ap—
proach (see first two rows per network in Table 3 and respective
rows in Supplementary Tables S7/S8). In the case of the ALL-DDI
dataset, including transcript data into PPIXpress allowed to detect
357 additional significant rewiring events in BioGRID and 120 add-
itional events in the IntAct network (compare respective columns in

Table 3).

3.2.1 Hallmarks of cancer

We first checked how many of the significantly rewired interactions
per construction method affected proteins that can be related to hall—
marks of cancer (see Section 2.3.7 for definition). Table 3 shows
aggregated results for this analysis. Details for the individual hall-
mark terms are given in Supplementary Tables S10/S11. A statistical

The rewiring of an interaction was deﬁned as signiﬁcant according to the statistical protocol described in Section 2.3.5. An interaction was said to participate

in a hallmark term if one of its associated proteins belonged to the corresponding set of hallmark proteins. The rows labelled ‘fraction’ depict the relative propor-

tion of hallmark-associated interactions among all detected interactions. Comprehensive results for the individual hallmark terms and all DDI datasets are pro-

vided in Supplementary Table 810 for the BioGRID network and in Supplementary Table 81 1 for IntAct, respectively.

assessment of the differences between the methods on the basis
of Wilcoxon signed—rank test is made in Supplementary Tables
S12/S13. Overall, a construction based on transcript expression
was, independently of the reference PPIN and DDI dataset used,
able to find a significantly larger number of differential interactions
that could be associated with hallmarks of cancer than the gene—level
approach (P <0.001 in all cases, see first column in Supplementary
Table S12). For example, of the statistically relevant rewiring events
revealed by the transcript—based construction on the basis of the
ALL-DDI dataset 315 more interactions indeed affected at least one
protein associated with any hallmark term compared to the inter—
actions detected by gene expression and 103 more in IntAct, respect—
ively (compare third row per network in Table 3 and Supplementary
Tables S10/S11). The fraction of such interactions among all differ-
ential interactions was not significantly higher (see first column in
Supplementary Table S13). Thus only the amount but not the dens—
ity of relevant information was higher compared to a gene—based
construction. With few exceptions this also held for individual hall-
mark terms (see fifth row per network in Table 3 for mean values
and Supplementary Tables S10/S11 for details). Regarding the abso—
lute number of interactions affecting certain protein sets, only in
‘Genome Instability and Mutation’ and ‘Avoiding Immune
Destruction’ in IntAct some of the transcript—based runs performed
slightly worse than the gene—based method (see respective rows
in Supplementary Table S11). The runs based on the highest—
confidence DDI dataset PREVHC never reported fewer interactions
in any term category, though.

When the transcript per protein was randomized as explained in
Section 2.3.6, the transcript—based analysis gave worse results than
the gene—based and all non—randomized transcript—based approaches
(Supplementary Tables S10—S13). In particular, significantly less
hallmark-relevant interactions were detected (P < 0.001 in all cases,
last row in Supplementary Table S12). The difference in relevant
fractions per hallmark term was not significant, though (see last row
Supplementary Table S13). Interestingly, it still found more inter-
actions related to ’Enabling Replicative Immortality’ in both refer-
ence networks than the gene—based methodology (see respective row
in Supplementary Tables S10/S11). As this was the only example
in all analyses where the randomized method was superior to the

gene—based one, we examined in what regard the proteins in that set
differed from all others, and how the gene—based method could lose
that much predictive power there. There was no noteworthy differ—
ence in the coverage of the interactions among this subset of proteins
but an increase in protein coverage compared to all other hallmark
sets with 82% in BioGRID (avg. hallmark proteins: 68%, details in
Supplementary Table S1) and 76% in IntAct (avg. hallmark pro-
teins: 63%, details in Supplementary Table S2). Thus comparatively
many proteins had at least one annotated domain that contributed
to the DDI/PPI mapping, but the majority of the networks was still
covered by artificial domains. Furthermore, the proteins associated
with ‘Enabling Replicative Immortality’ had the most variable do—
main compositions among the expressed transcripts per protein in
both BioGRID (8% more than any other protein subset, see
Supplementary Table S3) and IntAct (6% more than any other pro—
tein subset, see Supplementary Table S4). Intriguingly, they also had
the smallest fraction of expressed transcripts per protein that
had the same domain composition as the principal protein isoform
(2.5 —3.4% smaller than any other protein subset, see Supplementary
Tables S5/S6). Consequently, the proteins in ‘Enabling Replicative
Immortality’ had the largest divergence from the principal domain
composition among all protein subsets that we examined and thus
behaved most different compared to the gene—based construction.

3.2.2 Enrichment of exclusively found interactions

Next we examined for all transcript—based variants one—by—one if
significant changes were missed compared to a gene—based construc—
tion and which alterations were found in addition. To quantify the
relevance of rewiring events exclusively reported by either method,
enrichment analysis was performed on the affected proteins (see
Section 2.3.8). An outline of the results is presented in Table 4,
details are listed in Supplementary Tables S14/S15.

Generally, the results originating from gene— and transcript—
based construction methods diverged more strongly the more DDI
data was incorporated (see first rows in Supplementary Tables
S14/S15). While a larger DDI dataset enabled transcript—based
approaches to detect more interactions that were not considered by
the gene—based adjustment, also more interactions that were

In all but the ﬁrst lines per network, left values denote the outcome regarding interactions and proteins exclusively found in the gene-based approach and right

values the same for the transcript-based construction. Affected proteins are proteins linked to signiﬁcantly rewired interactions. Enrichment was determined ac-
cording to Section 2.3.8 and deﬁned as P < 0.05 (Bonferroni-adjusted). KEGG PWC abbreviates the enrichment of KEGG pathway ’hsa05200zPathways in can-
cer’ and GO BP abbreviates the GO category ’biological process’. Comprehensive results for all DDI datasets are provided in Supplementary Table 814 for the

BioGRID network and in Supplementary Table 815 for IntAct, respectively.

detected by the gene—based approach were not detected (see second
row per network in Table 4 and respective rows in Supplementary
Tables S14/S15). In all cases, the exclusively found significant
changes revealed by network construction based on transcripts fea—
tured many more enriched pathways and GO processes and also a
much higher enrichment of individual terms compared to the por—
tion of interactions that were only found by the gene—based ap—
proach. KEGG term ‘hsa05200zPathways in cancer’, for example,
was not enriched in the exclusive results of the gene—based approach
but strongly in those of the transcript—based method, independent of
the DDI dataset used (adjusted P < 10_5 in all cases, see fourth row
per network in Table 4 and respective rows in Supplementary
Tables S14/S15). It is worth pointing out that the identified enriched
terms are closely linked to carcinogenetic processes suggesting that
the rewired interactions are not simply random alterations overall
(Supplementary Tables S16/S17). The most prevalent changes exclu—
sively found by the transcript—based method using the largest DDI
dataset, for example, were found across 66 matched samples in both
networks. Four of the five exclusively found rewiring events across
both networks that occurred 66 times were related to the loss of an
interaction of FLT1 (P17948, ‘Vascular endothelial growth factor
receptor 1’), a tyrosine—protein kinase that acts as a cell—surface re—
ceptor for several cancer—relevant signaling cascades.

When the transcripts used to construct the specific DDIN were
randomized, the positive impact of the transcript—level data vanished
in comparison to the established gene—based methodology (see last
column in Table 4).

4 Conclusion

PPIXpress exploits domain interaction data to adapt protein inter—
action networks to specific cellular conditions at transcript—level de—
tail. For the example of protein interactions in breast cancer we
showed how this increase in granularity positively affected the per—
formance of the network construction compared to a method that

only makes use of gene expression data. A platform—independent
and dependency as well as installation—free implementation is pro-
vided that only requires little manual effort by the user.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The naked mole rat (Heterocephalus glaber) is an excep-
tionally long-lived and cancer-resistant rodent native to East Africa.
Although its genome was previously sequenced, here we report a
new assembly sequenced by us with substantially higher N50 values
for scaffolds and contigs.

Results: We analyzed the annotation of this new improved assembly
and identified candidate genomic adaptations which may have
contributed to the evolution of the naked mole rat’s extraordinary
traits, including in regions of p53, and the hyaIuronan receptors CD44
and HMMR (RHAMM). Furthermore, we developed a freely available
web portal, the Naked Mole Rat Genome Resource (http://www.naked-
mole-rat.org), featuring the data and results of our analysis, to assist
researchers interested in the genome and genes of the naked mole rat,
and also to facilitate further studies on this fascinating species.

1 INTRODUCTION

The naked mole rat (NMR; Heterocephalus glaber) is a long-lived
subterranean rodent native to the Horn of Africa. It can not only
live to >30 years, making it the longest-lived rodent, but is also
extremely resistant to neoplasia (Buffenstein, 2008; Tian et al.,
2013), and as a result is an ideal model for research on longevity,
cancer and disease resistance. The NMR genome was sequenced
at the BGI in 2011 to 92-fold coverage with a contig N50 of
19.3 kb and scaffold N50 of 1.6 Mb (Kim et al., 2011). Here we
describe a higher quality assembly (HetGla_female_l.0), which
has subsequently been sequenced by us at the Broad Institute,

its analysis and availability on a purpose-built portal, the Naked
Mole Rat Genome Resource (http://www.naked-mole—rat.org).

2 METHODS

Brieﬂy, high molecular weight DNA was extracted from tissues of a single
partially inbred female adult NMR obtained from the colony established
by Vera Gorbunova at the University of Rochester, USA. The founder
animals originated from the colony of J .U. Jarvis, at the University of
Cape Town, South Africa. The Heterocephalus glaber assembly,
HetGla_female_l.0, was constructed from 180 bp paired end fragment
libraries (45 x coverage), 3 kb jumping libraries (42 x coverage), 6—l4kb
sheared jumping libraries (2 x coverage) and 40 kb FOSILLs Williams
et al., 2012) (l xcoverage). All libraries were sequenced by Hi-Seq
Illumina machines, producing 101 bp paired-end reads. Assembly of the
NMR genome was carried out using the software program
ALLPATHS-LG (Gnerre et al., 2011) version R38830 with default
parameters.

3 RESULTS

HetGla_female_l.0 has substantially higher N50 for contigs
(47.8 kb) and scaffolds (20.5 Mb) when compared with the Kim
et a]. assembly (Table l). NG50 values, based on a C-value of 2.9
pg (source: http: //www. genomesize.com/result_species.php?
id=4474), are also considerably higher for HetGla_female_l.0:
35.3 kb for contigs (versus 18.1 kb for the Kim et a]. assembly)
and 20.0 Mb for scaffolds (versus 1.5 Mb).

To assist researchers in studying the genome and genes of the
NMR to improve understanding of its extraordinary traits, and
also to foster further studies employing this fascinating species,
we developed a freely available web portal, the Naked Mole Rat
Genome Resource (http://www.naked-mole-rat.org). Our portal
features an annotation of the HetGla_female_l.0 assembly
generated by the NCBI using the NCBI Eukaryotic Genome
Annotation Pipeline (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK
l69439/). To assess the accuracy of this annotation, 4578
proteins were identified which exhibit at least 99% length
conservation between human, mouse, rat and guinea pig ortho-
logs. Of these, 3413 exceed the same 99% length threshold using

the annotation of the HetGla_female_l.0 assembly, compared
with 2158 using the annotation of Kim et a].

All annotated NMR sequences derived from the NCBI anno-
tation of HetGla_female_l.0 are available on our portal: 42117
coding sequences, 1779 non-coding sequences and 41963 pro-
teins. The 12837 best-match NMR transcripts were identiﬁed
based on coding sequence length similarity with the guinea pig
ortholog, for which protein alignments and Ka/Ks ratios, calcu-
lated with the CodeML program of the PAML package v3.14
(Yang, 2007) using default parameters and guinea pig, mouse, rat
and human orthologs, are also included on the portal. Genes that
have been associated with longevity are cross-linked with the
GenAge database (http://www.naked-mole—rat.org/annotations/
results/genage/) (Tacutu et al., 2013). A BLAST interface is
also provided to allow users to quickly and easily search for
sequences of interest (including coding and non-coding se-
quences, proteins and scaffolds). We have previously also
sequenced the NMR transcriptome, which allowed us to com-
pare liver gene expression proﬁles between NMRs and wild-
derived mice (Yu et al., 2011). The data and results of this
work can also be downloaded (http://www.naked-mole—rat.org/
static/downloads/RNA_seq_supplements.zip). Moreover, an
additional ~23-fold coverage assembly of the NMR genome
generated by The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC) based on
two Illumina paired-end sequencing runs is available for down-
load (http: //www.naked-mole—rat.org/static/downloads/naked_
mole_rat_contigs.zip).

Guinea pig genes were used to analyse NMR orthologs of
potential signiﬁcance because it is the most closely related species
with a high coverage genome. Functionally enriched DAVID
(v6.7) clusters (using human/mouse orthologs and a background
of the 12837 best-match transcripts; otherwise default param-
eters were used) with an enrichment score >l.3, corresponding
to P<0.05 (Huang et al., 2009), for the top 5% of NMR genes
by Ka/Ks included cytokine activity, signal peptide and defense
response (Table 2).

Given the higher quality of this more recent genome annota-
tion, we assessed whether we could identify novel candidate
genes in the NMR that were not detected by Kim et a]. In par-
ticular, because p53 substitutions identical to those found in
human tumours have been identiﬁed in the related blind mole
rat Spalax ehrenbergi (Ashur-Fabian et al., 2004), it is relevant to
assess whether there is any evidence of adaptive evolution in
NMR p53. While the NMR p53 coding sequence is, not surpris-
ingly, subject to purifying selection (Ka/Ks = 0.26), a window

from codons 41—80 was observed, encompassing transactivation
domain 2 (TADII) and most of the proline-rich domain (PRD),
which had a signature of positive selection (Ka/Ks = 2.19). The
PRD is found between residues 58—98 and 55—95 of the human
and mouse proteins, respectively (Walker and Levine, 1996). The
human PRD contains numerous prolines including ﬁve PXXP
(P = proline, X = any amino acid) motifs, compared with only
two in mouse and one in rat (Toledo et al., 2007). Interestingly,
the NMR PRD substitutions include four proline residues, re-
sulting in an additional four PXXP motifs relative to the guinea
pig domain (Fig. 1).

This raises the possibility of convergent evolution of additional
prolines and PXXP motifs in the p53 PRDs of humans and
NMRs, two species which evolved an extended lifespan and con-
sequent requirement for an enhanced DNA damage response. In
addition, there are two NMR substitutions in the 9aaTADII,
which has been reported to mediate apoptosis by activating tar-
gets, including MDM2 and BAX (Zhu et al., 1998).

Numerous proteins have been shown to interact with p53,
including BRCA] via a region from residues 224—500 (Zhang
et al., 1998). There is a strong signal of selection within this
region of NMR BRCAI, particularly from codons 4304170
(Ka/Ks > 10), which may inﬂuence the interaction with p53.

Early contact inhibition (ECI) has been identiﬁed as a novel
anti-cancer mechanism in the NMR (Seluanov et al., 2009), with
high-molecular mass hyaluronan as the extracellular signal,
which is partly transmitted via the CD44 receptor (Tian et al.,
2013). Interestingly, a signal of selection (Ka/Ks> l) was
observed not only in CD44, from guinea pig codons 4014140,
501—540 and 661—700, but also in another hyaluronan receptor,
HMMR {RHAMM}, from codons 321—360, 381—420 and
441—480, suggesting that it may also contribute to transmission
of the ECI signal.

Kim et a]. reported that relative to mice, two early stop codons
in the NMR p16Ink4a transcript were predicted to produce a
truncated protein. There are no Cdkn2a transcripts in the
NCBI annotation; however, a predicted transcript was generated
based on alignments of the mouse and guinea pig exons with the
assembly and transcriptome. Although there are no signiﬁcant
differences with the transcript predicted by Kim et al., it is im-
portant to note that the guinea pig protein is also of similar
length and shorter than in mice, indicating that this is not an
NMR-speciﬁc adaptation (Fig. 2).

In conclusion, we have developed a NMR portal using a
genome assembly of superior quality for the research community
to beneﬁt from this data. Our portal is designed so it can be
easily updated if the NMR genome annotation is updated in

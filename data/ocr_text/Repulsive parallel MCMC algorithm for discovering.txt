Abstract

Motivation: The motif discovery problem consists of finding recurring patterns of short strings in a
set of nucleotide sequences. This classical problem is receiving renewed attention as most early
motif discovery methods lack the ability to handle large data of recent genome—wide ChIP studies.
New ChIP—tailored methods focus on reducing computation time and pay little regard to the accur—
acy of motif detection. Unlike such methods, our method focuses on increasing the detection
accuracy while maintaining the computation efficiency at an acceptable level. The major advantage
of our method is that it can mine diverse multiple motifs undetectable by current methods.

Results: The repulsive parallel Markov chain Monte Carlo (RPMCMC) algorithm that we propose is
a parallel version of the widely used Gibbs motif sampler. RPMCMC is run on parallel interacting
motif samplers. A repulsive force is generated when different motifs produced by different sam—
plers near each other. Thus, different samplers explore different motifs. In this way, we can detect
much more diverse motifs than conventional methods can. Through application to 228 transcrip—
tion factor ChIP—seq datasets of the ENCODE project, we show that the RPMCMC algorithm can find
many reliable cofactor interacting motifs that existing methods are unable to discover.

Availability and implementation: A C++ implementation of RPMCMC and discovered cofactor
motifs for the 228 ENCODE ChIP—seq datasets are available from http://daweb.ism.ac.jp/yoshidalab/

1 Introduction

The motif discovery problem has been receiving renewed attention
since recent experimental technologies, such as ChIP—seq, posed new
challenges. The problem is to identify recurring patterns of conserved
short strings that appear in a large fraction of nucleotide sequences.

(Wingender et 61]., 1995), we can predict not only the regions bound
by the primary TF but also the cofactors that modulate the TF activity
(Bailey, 2011; Goi et al., 2013; Smith et al., 2005).

Early methods of de novo motif discovery can be classified into
either a model—based [MEME (Bailey and Elkan, 1994), AlignACE
(Hughes et 61]., 2000), ANN—Spec (Workman and Stormo, 2000)] or
a word—count approach [Weeder (Pavesi et 61]., 2001)]. These meth—
ods were designed on the assumption that the input sequences of
N103 base pairs would range in size from 102 to 103. Hence, they
do not scale to the size of ChIP—seq data and their fundamental
methodologies have undergone reconstruction. However, most
ChIP-tailored algorithms emphasize computational efficiency, and
they sacrifice accuracy of motif detection because they use heuristics
to speed up their computation time.

The model—based methods employ either the EM algorithm
(Bailey and Elkan, 1994) or Gibbs sampling (Lawrence et 61]., 1993).
The main computational load arises in the process of calculating the
posterior probabilities over all fixed—length subsequences at every
iteration. STEME (Reid and Wernisch, 2011), a ChIP—tailored ver—
sion of MEME, uses a branch—and—bound technique, so that negli—
gible oligomers with significantly low probabilities are effectively
removed. The word—count methods, regardless of old or new, rely
on essentially the same strategy. All possible oligomers are counted
with exact or the fuzzy matching for input sequences. Then, overre—
presented oligomers are determined against background sequences.
Similar motifs are merged to generate output motifs. To reduce the
computational load in the counting operation, DREME (Bailey,
2011) and CisFinder (Sharov and Ko, 2009) adopt similar strategies.
Starting from 2 100 oligomers with no wildcards, each oligomer is
either left or removed recursively by adding a wildcard and by as—
sessing its significance. Such methods run the risk of missing import-
ant motifs in earlier steps of the recursion. Hegma (Ichinose et 61].,
2012) is the fastest of current algorithms. A highly specific strategy
based on Gray codes (Gray, 1947) is employed to avoid fuzzy
matching so as to speed up the merging of similar motifs. However,
this novel idea results in a degradation of the detection accuracy as
will be shown later.

The aim of this study is to derive a new algorithm that achieves
high detection accuracy while maintaining the computational effi-
ciency at an acceptable level. In particular, the proposed method is
designed to detect many diverse motifs that previous methods are
unable to discover. The proposed repulsive parallel MCMC
(RPMCMC) algorithm is a parallel version of the widely used Gibbs
motif sampler. One critical drawback of the standard Gibbs sam—
pling, as with the EM algorithm, arises from the following fact: the
posterior distribution is highly multimodal because many diverse
motifs are present in given sequences. Once the generated Markov
chain is absorbed to a locally high probability region, it is difficult
to escape from that region within a finite time. This problem has
received little attention in previous studies. MEME adopts a serial
implementation of the EM algorithm that repeats the search with
different initial conditions (Bailey and Elkan, 1994). To reduce the
possibility of becoming trapped in the same local optima, low prior
probabilities are assigned to already—discovered motif sites in con—
secutive serial runs. However, such iterative methods take too long
to be used for large ChIP data.

RPMCMC is run on parallel interacting Gibbs samplers. A re—
pulsive force comes into play when the trajectories of different
chains near each other. Therefore, different chains are facilitated to
explore different regions. Compared with the original method using
a single chain, this all—at—once interacting parallel run can detect
much more diverse motifs. In addition, the proposed method has

other unique characteristics, for instance automated control of vari—
able—length motifs, and the fast—clustering algorithm for many gener-
ated motifs in the summarization step. We implemented the
RPMCMC algorithm with C—I——I—, which is available from the
Supplementary Website. The method was comprehensively tested on
synthetic promoter sequences and 228 TE ChIP—seq datasets of the
ENCODE project. In the synthetic promoter analysis, RPMCMC
found around 1.5 times as many embedded motifs as existing
methods did. For the ChIP—seq datasets, the RPMCMC algorithm
reported 444 reliable cofactors in total, 219 of which were not dis—
covered by either of the recently published ChIP—tailored algorithms:
DREME and Hegma. On the Supplementary Website, we provide
all the discovered cofactor motifs which were associated with anno—
tated motifs in JASPAR.

2 Methods

2.1 Model
We use the ZOOPS model (Bailey and Elkan, 1994) that allows zero

or one motif occurrence per sequence. Assume that we are given a

set of 11 sequences, 5+ : {s13  ,si}, where sequence sf is of
length L,- (i : 1,  ,n). The reverse complement of the given se—
quence set is denoted by S‘ : {s1_, . . . ,s;  Our model uses the set

of n concatenated sequences, S = {$1,  ,sn}, where s,- : (sis?)
(i : 1, . . . ,n). The motif presence indicator z,- takes the value 1 or 0
according to the presence or absence of a motif in sequence s,-. In a
sequence s,- with z,: 1, a K-mer motif is positioned at the start site
14,- E {1,  ,L, —K—l—1,L,-—l—1,  ,2L,- —K—l—1}. The lath element
of the motif follows the position—specific multinomial distribution
with 0k : (0kg, (9)376, 0kg, emf, which represents the nucleotide pref—
erence of the lath element to A, C, G, T. Thus, we have
O : (01, . . . , 0K), a position probability matrix (PPM). We treat the
motif length K as an unknown parameter. The background se—
quences are assumed to follow independent multinomial trials with
the background probability denoted by 00 : (007a, 0075, 007g, 00¢)T
Given an input S, the objective is to estimate the PPM O with
the unknown motif length K and the background probability 00
where the latent variables comprise U : {141, . . . ,un} and
Z : {z1, . . . ,zn}. The likelihood is then

Where ﬁle : (ﬁlaa: ﬂk,ca ﬂk,g7 ﬂk,t)T  Z 17 - - - 7K) and a :
(Ola, occ, org, at) are the concentration parameters fixed at set values.
The prior on O is conditioned by the motif length K. The equal
probabilities are assigned to any K with a range between the prede—
termined minimum and maximum motif lengths, Kmin and Kmax.

To complete the joint posterior of all the unknown parameters,
we prescribe the priors on U and Z as follows:

1
mn—K+n

p(z,-=1|K)=yK fori:1,  ,n.

pm=mm=

The start site 14,- of a motif occurs with equal probability in all the
possible positions in sequence s,-. The motif presence indicator z,- fol-
lows the binomial distribution with the success probability yK for
eachi(0§y§ 1).

Note that although a specific type of modeling is presented here,
our current program allows for a certain amount of flexibility in the
model specification. For instance a user can choose a higher—order
Markov background model up to third order (da Fonseca et al.,
2008) and a position specific prior for the motif start sites (Bailey
et al., 2010).

2.2 Multiple motifs and local trap

Let x denote all the unknowns, U, Z, K, O and 00. To obtain an esti—
mate approximately with the posterior p(x|S), we can employ a
Gibbs sampling method. However, the Gibbs motif sampler has a
serious drawback in that inherent presence of a great many different
motifs causes a complex energy landscape of the posterior distribu—
tion. In particular, once the trajectory of a Markov chain comes into
a locally high-probability region which corresponds to one of the
existing motifs, it is difficult to effect a transfer into another region
within a finite runtime. The EM algorithm might exhibit the same
defects.

As an illustration, we show a result of the simple Gibbs motif
sampling. The dataset consists of 103—bp—long synthetic promoter se—
quences of 300 human genes. The Gibbs sampling was repeated 20
times under different initial conditions. As shown in Figure 1, all the
chains were trapped at similar AT—rich motifs for a long duration.
Exceedingly high probabilities might be concentrated on the AT—rich
segments and all the chains were absorbed to those domains of the
posterior distribution. This is a typical scenario. Figure 1 also shows

lighted on 300 promoter sequences. The top and bottom panels display the
processes of produced PPMs (sequence-logos) for RPMCMC with 20 replicas
and independent Gibbs sampling under 20 different initial conditions. Five of
the 20 sampling paths are shown for each method

the result of RPMCMC, which was run with 20 interacting parallel
Gibbs samplers as described below. By performing just an all-
at—once parallel run, RPMCMC could capture much more diverse
motifs than the independent Gibbs sampling could.

2.3 RPMCMC algorithm

The RPMCMC algorithm is derived by creating an augmented
system TEA (x1,  ,xM|ﬂ), which consists of M exact copies 7t,(x) :
p(x|S) (i = 1, . . . ,M) of the posterior distribution and the repulsive

force function w(x1,  ,xM):

M
nA(x1..xMI/3)o< Hem-W061,  .xMWzo. (2)
i=1

Each x,- is called a replica. The repulsive force function 50 imposes a
stronger penalty on closer replicas. The parameter ﬂ controls the
force severity, i.e. a greater ﬂ produces a stronger repulsion and
vice versa. Drawing samples of x1,  ,xM simultaneously from
Equation (2), the M sample paths tend to move toward different
regions. Furthermore, a replica trapped in a locally high probabil-
ity state can be pushed to other regions by the repulsive force
derived from approaching replicas (Fig. 2). It is important to see
that the use of a non—zero force severity brings bias to the samples
from TEA with respect to the posterior distribution. With ﬂ20,
which removes the repulsion from TEA, an unbiased sample set can
be obtained.

The repulsive force function is defined as a function of PPMs,
w(x1,  ,xM) E ¢(O1,  ,OM). Let D(O,-,O,-) be an increasing
function of the dissimilarity between O,- and O). With this, the repul—
sion is modeled by

j:/<1

M
1,0(x1,  ,xM) : Hexp(minD(O,-,O,-)). (3)

Replica i interacts with its nearest neighbor j*, such that
j* : arg min/3K,- D(O,-, Of). The dissimilarity D is measured by

the column sizes of O,- and O], are different. The distance of the
PPMs is assessed after associating a smaller—sized PPM with the

To obtain an estimate from the augmented posterior, Gibbs
sampling is combined with several techniques such as the reversible—
jump MCMC method (Green, 1995) and the slice sampler (Neal,
2003). The full details of the RPMCMC procedure are described
in Supplementary Method Sl. The proposed method generates
Markov chains of the M replicas in parallel. Then, different chains
move toward different regions of the state space due to the
repulsion. We can discover a much wider variety of motifs with an
all—at—once interacting parallel simulation than with the independent
method. Conventional Gibbs sampling with M different initial seeds
(as shown in the previous subsection) can be derived by setting the
zero force severity, ﬂ = 0, to RPMCMC.

Suppose that we are given a sample set of size N ><M from
Equation (2) with nonzero ﬂ, denoted by {x)i)|i : 1,  ,
M, j : 1,  ,N} where each xiii) denotes the jth sample of the ith
replica. Obviously, the repulsive force leads to biased samples with
respect to the target 7tA(x1,  ,xM|0) in Equation (2) at the zero
force severity. To correct this bias, the importance sampling is used,
which assigns a weight to each sample as

, (I) (I) 0 1
wl’) =—ﬂA(x(I)i  axii] )OC (I) (I) ' (5)
7tA(x1,...,xM|ﬂ) w(x1,...,xM)

The ratio between the target (zero force) and the biased distribution
(ﬂ > 0) becomes the inverse of the repulsive force function. Note
that the M replicas xiii) (1' = 1, . . . ,M) in the jth ensemble share the
same weight.

As shown in Supplementary Method Sl, our current implemen-
tation does not parallelize the process of updating the M Markov
chains. We use multi—core processors only for counting the nucleo—
tide frequencies when renewing the motif start sites.

2.4 Post—processing: clustering and ranking

RPMCMC produces many redundant outputs with slight variations.
We reduce the redundancy by grouping the outputs into g clusters,
C1,  ,Cg, based on the dissimilarity of the sampled PPMs. The
procedure is as follows (see Fig. 3 for a schematic illustration):

i. Samples of size p = M X N are arranged as 17 : {x(1), . .. ,x(p)}
by sorting realized values of the likelihood [Equation (1)] in
decreasing order.

ii. Set 2 > 0, a threshold for the within—cluster variability.

(a) Initiate the lath cluster Ck : {1cm} by a singleton of the

representative.

(b) Collect all samples satisfying the condition D(O(1), Ow) g 2
where O02 denotes the PPM of x“). These samples are
integrated into cluster Ck; Ck : {x(i)|D(O(1), Ow) g 2,
z‘: 1,  ,p}.

(c) Discard the collected samples in Ck from the ordered se—
quence; 17 <— 17 \ Ck. Let p be the length of 17 and rearrange 17
according to the likelihood values.

(d) If 17 is empty, terminate the computation. Otherwise, let
la <— le —1— 1 and go back to step (a).

The method operates with a single input parameter 2 that con—
trols the number g of clusters. Samples within D g 2 are assigned to
the cluster representative me, which is the one to achieve the highest
likelihood within the lath cluster members.

Denote the p = M X N samples and their importance weights by
{x(i),w(i)}f:1. With the g reduced samples {711,

in {711, . . . , ,ug} are of primary interest for motif discovery. We gen—
erate a ranked list of the reduced discovered motifs, which are
ordered according to the weights 107:.

2.5 Performance evaluation

We report the performance of several motif discovery algorithms on
two types of data: (i) promoter sequences into which strings gener-
ated from PPMs in the JASPAR CORE database are planted
and (ii) 228 TF ChIP—seq datasets of the ENCODE project. We
evaluate the performance for each type of data as follows:

(i) Given the nucleotide positions of known and predicted motifs,
recall [sensitivity (SN)] and precision [positive predicted value
(PPV)] are evaluated at a nucleotide level. These criteria have
commonly been used, for instance in Tompa et al. (2005) (we
use the abbreviations SN and PPV according to convention). For
given ] known motifs, we deﬁne slightly modiﬁed SN and PPV
for the evaluation of multiple output motifs.

Let p,- be the output that achieves the most overlapping
predicted sites with the jth known motif among the g outputs
(if there are two or more outputs having the same number of
overlapped nucleotides, the one with the higher rank given by a
motif ﬁnder is chosen). Then, the recall and the precision are
computed as

A low SN statistic indicates the lack of ability to discover

redundant sets of randomly selected 17 E {300, 600, 1200, 2500, g _

5000} promoter sequences obtained from UCSC.hg19 with two 3 II E

different kinds; one composed of fixed—length sequences of 1000 bp r

and the other of variable—length sequences varied between 200  '='

and 2000 bp. Oligomers generated by randomly chosen 10 JASPAR u ;

CORE PPM collections were planted into randomly selected _ i _ _

start sites, so that each sequence has eight motifs on average. For
each data size 11, we prepared 20 different sequence sets. With
this ground truth, we measured the change in recall and precision.
All parameters of RPMCMC and the specified Weeder options
are listed in Table 1. For DREME and Hegma, we employed the
default parameters. The parameters of RPMCMC were empirically
chosen.

Figure 4(a) summarizes the SN and PPV values as a function of n
for RPMCMC, Hegma and Weeder. DREME was removed from
this figure because there was no way of calculating SN and PPV due
to the lack of outputs on motif sites in the distributed program. The
numbers of outputs from RPMCMC, Hegma and Weeder were
85.7, 214.76 and 13.3 on average, respectively. It can be seen that
RPMCMC outperformed the other methods. For the fixed—length
datasets, RPMCMC delivered SN values around 1.7 times higher
than those of the other two methods. The PPVs of RPMCMC
were around 1.5 times higher than those of Hegma. As shown in
Figure 4(b), the results on the variable—length datasets were similar
to those on the fixed—length datasets except that the performance
of Hegma was significantly degraded.

Fig. 4. Performance comparison among RPMCMC, Hegma and Weeder on
synthetic datasets: (a) fixed-length sequence sets and (b) variable-length
sequence sets. Motifs were generated according to the JASPAR CORE PPM
collection and were inserted randomly into a set of promoter sequences.
SN (left) and PPV (right) values of each method are plotted against the vary-
ing sequence sizes, n E {300, 600, 1200, 2500, 5000}

We analyzed the cause of the observed low SN and PPV statistics
for Hegma and Weeder, as illustrated with the results on the fixed—
length datasets. It was found that Hegma has a strong tendency to
divide planted regions of a motif into a few different predicted
motifs. Such incorrectly fragmented outputs acted to increase PPV
slightly but resulted in the observed low SN. A distinctive character—
istic of Weeder is the fairly low PPV, whereas several comparative
studies reported Weeder to be one of the best performing algorithms
among early motif finders (Tompa et al., 2005). A region predicted
by Weeder tends to include not only a planted motif region but also
many background regions. RPMCMC could achieve much higher
SN and PPV than the others could.

Figure 5(a) gives the computation time for each method.
RPMCMC was implemented in C—I——I—. We used the C programs
for DREME, Hegma and Weeder, which are available on®the au—
thors’ websites. All the tests were conducted on Intel Xeon
PhiTMcoprocessors with 61—core CPUs and 48 GB of main memory.
In terms of computation efficiency, Hegma outperformed the others
and RPMCMC was comparable to DREME. In particular, the com-
putation times of RPMCMC and DREME were about a 10000th
those of Hegma. RPMCMC would sustain an acceptable level of
computation time, and furthermore, it might be possible to render
the algorithm more efficient. The bottleneck in RPMCMC is in the
process of calculating the posterior probabilities of the motif start
sites 14,- (see details in Supplementary Method Sl): with a given PPM,
K x Z,- 2(L,- — K —I— 1) times calculations were necessary to perform
in every iteration over all possible K—mer consecutive subsequences
in S. This process can fully be parallelized into independent process—
ing elements. Alternatively, we could use a branch—and—bound
technique as in STEME that effectively prunes subsequences with
negligibly low probabilities.

We remark on the difficulty in detecting the burn-in time for
RPMCMC. An initial portion of the Markov chain samples should
be discarded because the chain approaches its stationary distribution
(Cowles and Carlin, 1996) following a sufficient burn-in period.
Figure 6 shows the process of evolving the likelihood during a
RPMCMC run. The series of the likelihood values remained insta—
ble, which indicates a fairly slow mixing of the Markov chain
because the target distribution was inherently multimodal and
the parallel interacting chains switched their target local modes

burn—in periods that looks for multimodality of the posterior distri—

than an obvious approach of giving as long as possible for a trial

3.2 ENCODE ChIP—seq datasets

Using RPMCMC with the default parameters given in Table 1, we
predicted the cofactor motifs of the primary TF for each of the 228
datasets of ChIP—seq experiments in the ENCODE project (The
ENCODE Project Consortium, 2012). FASTA files were produced
by clipping the sequences of UCSC.hg19 at the locations recorded
in SYDH TFBS narrowPeak files (available from NCBI’s Gene
Expression Omnibus using the accession number GSE31477). We
removed datasets that had only a few sequences after removing frag—
ments with lengths less than 200 or more than 500 from the ob—
tained FASTA files. Also, we removed datasets which have more
than one percent of sequences including blacklist regions reported
on https://sites.google.com/site/anshulkundaje/projects/blacklists.
In this way, we obtained the 228 datasets from the total of 359 data—
sets. The numbers of the input sequences ranged from 205 to 49
211. RPMCMC produced 51—149 output motifs for each dataset.
A discovered motif, for instance {Uk,Ok} in Me, was regarded as
being significantly enriched if it appeared in 5% or more of the input
sequences, i.e. 2?:1z7/112005. At the acceptable level of signifi-
cance on the TOMTOM’s E—values £0.05, approximately 15 sig—
nificantly enriched outputs on average could have correspondence
to one of the experimentally validated TFBSs in JASPAR CORE.
In Supplementary Data Sl, we provide the lists of de 1101/0 cofactor
motifs for all TF—ChIP datasets with the results of JASPAR
annotations.

In the experiments, Hegma produced a far greater number of
outputs (1081 outputs on average over all datasets) than RPMCMC
(110 outputs) and DREME (49 outputs). The outputs of Hegma
possibly included many redundant motifs. Removing motifs with
2:721 z,- /11 < 0.05 from the total outputs, the average numbers of
outputs of Hegma, RPMCMC and DREME dropped to 24, 110 and
33, respectively.

The computation times of each algorithm for 10 selected datasets
including the smallest and the largest dataset are shown in
Figure 5 (b). Compared with the experiment with the synthetic data—
sets, the computation times of RPMCMC were a little inferior to
those of DREME for the ChIP—seq datasets. RPMCMC would still
sustain an acceptable level of computation time. As discussed in the
previous subsection, the current implementation of the RPMCMC
algorithm is yet to be optimized for speed.

As shown in Figure 7(a), the numbers of known motifs signifi-
cantly matched to the outputs of RPMCMC (E—values £0.05) were
larger than those of Hegma and DREME for 74% of the 228 data—
sets. Although RPMCMC produced the largest numbers of outputs
among the three methods, the LLR values of the discovered motifs
of RPMCMC were much higher than those of the others as in
Figure 7(b). This indicates that RPMCMC has a great potential to
mine many reliable diverse motifs that are undetected by the existing
methods.

Table 2 shows 15 cofactors that were predicted by RPMCMC
on a ChIP dataset (ngncodeSythfbsHepg2Nrf1IggrabPk) in
which the binding sites of NRF1 were studied in HepG2. The bind—
ing sites of RPN4 and USF1 were detected only by RPMCMC.
It was reported that both RPN4 and NRF1 are involved in the same
proteasome activity (Radhakrishnan et al., 2010; Xu et al., 2011),

NRF1 is the ChIPed TF and the rest are the predicted cofactors. All motifs,
which could be annotated at E-Value S 0.05 according to JASPAR, are shown
with the E-Values of TOMTOM (second column) and the ranking by
RPMCMC (third column). The last two columns indicate the presence (P) or
absence (A) of the motif in the outputs of Hegma and DREME, respectively.

and the interaction of USF1 and Nrf1 is involved in the transcrip-
tional regulation of FMP1 gene (Prasad and Singh, 2008).

Figure 8 summarizes the detection ability to discover diverse
motifs based on a Venn diagram of all matching motifs produced
from the analyses of the 228 datasets. The outputs of RPMCMC
contained almost all of the outputs of DREME and Hegma, and,
notably, 219 annotated cofactors were uniquely discovered by
RPMCMC.

4 Concluding remarks

In the motif discovery problem, the direct use of a Gibbs sampling
method revealed an inability to find latent diverse motifs even in a
fairly small number of input sequences. In the application for only

all the 228 datasets, reported by RPMCMC, Hegma and DREME

300 input sequences, all simulations with different initializations be-
came trapped in the AT—rich motifs, which are of little significance
in practice. This highlighted a critical drawback of the Gibbs sam—
pling methods. The same is true for the EM algorithm. Because bio—
logical sequences generally contain rather diverse conserved
patterns, which are sometimes biologically meaningless, the poster—
ior distribution exhibits a very complex landscape as it includes
many locally high probability regions. Our view is that solving this
problem is the essence of improving the accuracy of motif discovery.
Motivated by this, we presented a new motif discovery method
called RPMCMC, which is a parallel variant of the widely used
Gibbs motif samplers. The rather simple idea is to run the Gibbs
motif samplers in parallel by making use of the repulsive force
on different samplers. With all—at—once sampling, we could discover
diverse motifs by which the parallel samplers divide their responsi-
bility in the overall search region.

As another contribution, we provided a list of predicted cofactor
motifs that were overrepresented in the 228 ENCODE ChIP-seq
datasets. RPMCMC can potentially mine promising annotated
motifs which other word—count methods fail to find. To narrow
down things to truly functional cofactor sets, it is necessary to con—
duct further validation experiments.

ABSTRACT

Mass spectrometry is widely used in bioanalysis, including the fields of
metabolomics and proteomics, to simultaneously measure large num-
bers of molecules in complex biological samples. Contaminants rou-
tinely occur within these samples, for example, originating from the
solvents or plasticware. Identification of these contaminants is crucial
to enable their removal before data analysis, in particular to maintain
the validity of conclusions drawn from uni- and multivariate statistical
analyses. Although efforts have been made to report contaminants
within mass spectra, this information is fragmented and its accessibil-
ity is relatively limited. In response to the needs of the bioanalytical
community, here we report the creation of an extensive manually
well-annotated database of currently known small molecule
contaminants.

Availability: The Mass spectrometry Contaminants Database
(MaConDa) is freely available and accessible through all major brow-
sers or by using the MaConDa web service http://www.maconda.

1 INTRODUCTION

Our understanding of biological systems has considerably im-
proved through recent developments in mass spectrometry
(MS)-based metabolomics (Dettmer et al., 2007; Patti et al.,
2012). Continuous efforts have been made to improve the quality
of metabolome measurements, including in sample preparation
Willas-Boas et al., 2005), data collection (Dunn et al., 2011;
Weber et al., 2011) and data analysis (Dunn et al., 2012;
Weber et al., 2011). Nonetheless, sample preparation methods
and MS analyses have the potential to introduce contaminants,
such as plasticizers, additives and solvents (Keller et al., 2008).
Such contaminants of laboratory origin can obscure or even fals-
ify biological interpretation of the data. For example, when using
univariate or multivariate statistical analyses for biomarker dis-
covery, the conclusions of that study can be fundamentally
ﬂawed if signals remain unidentiﬁed and are later discovered to
be exogenous chemicals. Several analytical methods have been
reported to minimize the interference caused by MS contamin-
ants. Despite these improvements, contaminants are still a major

problem in MS experiments. Improved methods to identify and
then treat contaminants appropriately are required urgently.
Although in most cases identiﬁed contaminants should be elimi-
nated from datasets, occasionally they can be beneﬁcial, for
example, when used for internal mass calibration of spectra
(Scheltema et al., 2008).

Here we present a manually well-annotated database of
currently known MS contaminants to assist both the metabolo-
mics and bioanalytical chemistry communities in their data
processing.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

The information contained in Mass spectrometry Contaminants
Database (MaConDa) is based on published literature (e.g. sci-
entiﬁc papers, notes and hand books; see Supplementary
Material) and data provided by several colleagues and instru-
ment manufacturers, including the extensive resource by Keller
et al. (2008). The raw data have been manually searched and
curated, and parsed to a relational MySQL 5.0 database using
Python 2.7.2 scripts. Theoretical and/or experimental data were
stored for each MS contaminant, such as name, type of contam-
inant (e. g. plasticizer, detergent or buffer; see Table 1), empirical
formula and details regarding the MS platform used (e.g. ion
trap, triple quadrupole or time-of-ﬂight MS). Theoretical mass
values calculated to six decimal places and observed mass values
for related ion forms (e.g. [M+H]+, [M+Na]+ and [M — H]')
were also recorded, along with the original reference. Finally,
cross references (e. g. PubChem Compound Identiﬁer and
Standard InChI code) were added for all MS contaminants
when available. A user-friendly web interface to search the data-
base has been implemented in PHP 5.3.3 J avaScript and de-
ployed on an Apache 2.2 web server. The NuSOAP PHP
library (http://sourceforge.net/projects/nusoap/) has been used
to create a Web service, trivializing the integration of
MaConDa into existing MS data analysis workﬂows. The Web
service has been tested using a Simple Object Access Protocol
(SOAP) Python client (https://fedorahosted.org/suds/) and
Taverna (Hull et al., 2006).

3 RESULTS

MaConDa contains more than 200 contaminant records detected
across several MS platforms. The majority of records include
theoretical as well as experimental MS data. In a few cases, ex-
perimental data were included without rigorous identiﬁcation

(Sumner et al., 2007). The majority of experimental data reported
in the literature has been collected in positive ion mode, which is
reﬂected in the database. Also, the amount of MS/MS data for
contaminants is currently rather limited. However, the database
has the capability to store this type of data as more is recorded
by the community. As such, and to the best of our knowledge,
this is the ﬁrst publicly accessible, readily searchable, readily
implementable into an automated computational pipeline, read-
ily expandable database of mass spectral contaminants.
A summary of the MaConDa features:

0 Database access via SOAP web service;

0 Database access via a user-friendly browser Web interface;
0 Batch processing of peak lists;

0 Searching of contaminants using additional ion forms;

0 Exporting results into different formats (e. g. tab-delimited
and CSV);

0 Multiple database identiﬁers (e. g. PubChem Compound
Identiﬁer and Standard InChI code) for each contaminant
to allow cross-referencing with other resources or databases;

0 The total database is freely available in several formats
(e. g. tab-delimited, CSV, XML and SQL format).

4 CONCLUSIONS

MaConDa is an extensive manually well-annotated database
that provides a useful and unique resource for the MS commu-
nity. Analytical techniques used in metabolomics and proteomics

are continually enhanced to improve their sensitivity. As a result,
new contaminants are introduced into the experimental pipeline.
Continued input of these new contaminants from the MS com-
munity and our own laboratory will enhance MaConDa as a
valuable resource.

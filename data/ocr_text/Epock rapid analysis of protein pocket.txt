Abstract

Summary: The volume of an internal protein pocket is fundamental to ligand accessibility. Few
programs that compute such volumes manage dynamic data from molecular dynamics (MD)
simulations. Limited performance often prohibits analysis of large datasets. We present Epock, an
efficient command—line tool that calculates pocket volumes from MD trajectories. A plugin for the
VMD program provides a graphical user interface to facilitate input creation, run Epock and analyse
the results.

Availability and implementation: Epock C++ source code, Python analysis scripts, VMD Tcl plugin,

1 Introduction

In drug design, the characterization of binding pockets is a key issue
often addressed using molecular dynamics (MD). MD simulations
unveil the evolution of large and complex biomolecular systems
over time. With increasing computer power, MD generates increas—
ingly large datasets with more frames and particles. The majority
of existing programs are not optimized for such large trajectories,
so analysis of pocket evolution requires improved software
tools that are able to process pocket data in a reasonable time. To
tackle this issue, we developed Epock, a software for efficient
tracking of protein pocket volume throughout MD trajectories.
We demonstrate Epock’s functionality on the ligand—gated
Gloeobacter violaceus Ion Channel (GLIC) homologue of the
human nicotinic receptor (Laurent et 61]., 2013) and Heat Shock
Protein 90 (HSP90).

2 Epock program features

The Epock program takes a topology and MD trajectory as input.
A configuration file specifies parameters for each cavity to be charac—
terized, including a maximum encompassing region (MER). The
MER provides spatial bounds for each cavity using a combination of
simple three—dimensional objects (spheres, cylinders and cuboids) to
determine a complex final shape. Epock is therefore intended to fol—
low a priori determined cavities over time, not for cavity identifica—
tion. Our implementation extends the method proposed by Durrant
et al. (2011) in the POVME program. The Epock Tcl/Tk plugin for
VMD (Humphrey et 61]., 1996) offers an intuitive way to choose and
position shapes to define the MER (see Fig. 1A and B). The Epock
command—line tool natively reads xtc trajectory format used by
GROMACS (www.gromacs.org). Using the VMD plugin, a variety of
~13 input trajectory formats can be processed with Epock.

t: 1500 ps (E) and t: 3500 ps (F)

For each pocket, Epock calculates the space accessible to a probe,
called ‘free space’, which is the set of all grid points where distance to
protein exceeds the user—defined probe radius (typically, 1.4 A). The
number of grid points that overlap each cavity residue is stored and
can be outputted as ‘residue contribution’. The volume of the free
space is then calculated at higher precision using a finer grid.

In addition to pocket volumes, Epock outputs pore profiles by
calculating the radius of the largest disc that fits the previously de—
tected free space along the Z axis. Epock produces similar results as
the Hole software frequently used to characterize macromolecular
channels (Smart et al., 1993; Supplementary Fig. Sl).

Epock output files include the computed trajectory of free space
over time, a feature inspired by the trj_cavity software (Paramo
et al., 2014). This trajectory is readable by VMD to accessibly illus—
trate the relationship between pocket volume and protein conform-
ation. Results for pocket volume, residue contribution and pore
profile can be plotted in VMD using our plugin or the provided
Python scripts (see online documentation: http://epock.bitbucket.
org/docs).

3 Applications: GLIC and HSP90 binding pocket
characterization

The GLIC channel binds general anaesthetics. It is a challenging test
case because of its size, 1555 residues and the presence of numerous
interconnected pockets. The volume of a single pocket was
computed over an 800—frame trajectory of the protein (25 420
atoms, 75 MB).

Epock results are shown in Figure 1. A dramatic decrease of cav—
ity volume is observed after ~15 00 ps (Fig. 1C), alongside particu—
larly high variability in volume contribution of residue Y197 (Fig.
1C and D). Simultaneous visualization of the protein trajectory
alongside the pocket free space (Fig. 1E and F) confirms that Y197
side chain movement governs this pocket volume decrease.

We compared Epock performances and validated results with
respect to the programs POVME (Durrant et al., 2011) and
MDpocket (Schmidtke et al., 2011) (details in Supplementary
Discussion). Epock was the fastest program tested, analysing the
800—frame GLIC trajectory in 6s. While absolute pocket volumes
may differ among programs, volume variations over time are
strongly correlated indicating qualitatively identical results (see
Supplementary Fig. 82).

In a second application, we used Epock to analyse the volume of
the ligand binding domain of the HSP90 based on a range of differ—
ent conformations and complexes captured by crystallography (as
discussed in the original MDpocket paper Schmidtke et al., 2011,
see Supplementary Discussion and Supplementary Fig. S4). Epock
processed this dataset of 86 X—ray structures in PDB format in a
matter of seconds, producing output that allowed correlation be—
tween the pocket volume and movements of a particular helix
formed by residues 100—110, as reported by Wright et al. (2004).
Analysis highlighted opening of the binding pocket and identified
residues implicated in volume variations of up to 200  All observa—
tions are in very good agreement with the published results.

All datasets used for benchmarking Epock are available to down—
load from our website.

4 Conclusion

To advance our understanding of the events which modulate pocket
volume, we present the open—source package Epock, which special—
izes in rapid pocket volume evaluation for MD simulations.
Epock provides detailed output of pocket volume variations, residue
contributions and clear visualization of pocket dynamics in VMD.

In ‘Discovering hospital admission patterns using models learnt
from electronic hospital records’ Arandjelovic proposes a new
model for prediction of hospital admissions based on representing a
patient’s medical record as a binary history record. There is no
doubt that the use of electronic medical records to predict aspects of
healthcare such as readmission risk, length of stay or even likelihood
of death is an important research area in medical informatics. Such
studies have a potentially broad impact on the evaluation and im-
provement of the quality of care, ranging from assessing clinical
risks to measuring the costs associated with them (Cai et al., 2015;
McCoy et al., 2015). We agree with Arandjelovic on the relevance
of this topic and the volume of publications focused on specific dis-
eases and interventions. Nonetheless, for these very same reasons,
we have serious concerns regarding the data handling methods and
thus the conclusions reached by Arandjelovic in this article. The
dataset used in the analysis is described sketchily, lacks some rele-
vant information that would facilitate the interpretation of this
work and contains several other elements of concern.

Initially it was the apparent misconception in the (mis-) use of
the codes included in the analyses that alarmed us the most.
According to the author this article is based on the analysis of
International Classification of Diseases (ICD) codes extracted from
clinical records, but the author fails to state clearly what version or
versions of the ICD codes was used for the development of the meth-
odology. There are several versions of ICD codes that have been
used for the codification of diagnosis/diseases/procedures in health
records, and these versions differ in several important ways—such
as the use of different codification strategies (e.g. alphanumeric in
ICD-10 versus numeric in ICD-9) and the number of chapters. The

bibliographic reference provided in this article and its description of
the use of alphanumeric characters suggest the use of ICD-10 (http://
www.who.int/classifications/icd/en, Accessed October 26 2015), but
the number of chapters, 12, does not match the 22 chapters included
in ICD-10. Of further concern is the article’s selection of the code
E62, which it describes as ‘respiratory infections/inﬂammations’.
The author places this code, according to its starting letter ‘E’, under
chapter four (IV) of ICD-10 (‘Endocrine, nutritional and metabolic
diseases’). The conceptual mismatch alone should raise doubts
even among readers unfamiliar with ICD-10, and indeed further
inspection would reveal that E62 does not exist as an ICD-10 code
(http://apps.who.int/classifications/icd1 0/browse/20 1 6/en, Accessed
October 26 2015).

Because of the lack of details about the dataset used and given
the aforementioned example, we proceeded to analyze in further de-
tail the rest of the codes provided in this article, comparing them
with the ICD-10 codes, to check whether this was an unfortunate
error limited to the introduction or a misconception propagated in
further sections of the article. Our analysis of the codes in Table 1 of
the article, which are said to account for 75% of the analyzed ad-
missions, showed that they are either incorrect—meaning that they
do not match the description provided (24 out of 30, 80%)—or
non-existent (the remaining 6 out of 30, 20%).

After this initial analysis, we attempted to identify a plausible
origin for the codes used in this article, comparing them with other
medical informatics codes. The results of our analysis point toward
the use of the Australian Refined Diagnosis Related Groups (AR-
DRGs). Determining the exact version used is impossible due the re-
moval of the additional letter that builds the code) (https://www.

accd.net.au/Downloads.aspx Accessed October 26 2015). This cod-
ing system refers to different episodes of care rather than diagnosis,
with a focus on funding and management of the services provided
by hospitals, relating patient records to the costs incurred by the
hospital. AR-DRG codes are derived from existing hospital data, dy-
namic, and frequently reviewed (approximately every two years).
Although clinically coherent about patient demographics, diagnosis
and interventions, these codes are not intended to provide diagnos-
tics insights. They reduce the complexity of ICD codes tremen-
dously, through merging several ICD codes under the same DRG,
and they take into account other parameters such as the level of re-
source utilization and statistical soundness. DRG codes are split ac-
cording to different variables such as age and separation mode, by
adding an additional letter to the code. With that additional letter
(e.g. B70A, B70B, B70C, B70D or Z402) DRGs include information
regarding the complexity of the procedures carried out.

Assuming that the codes in Arandjelovic’s Table 1 are DRG
codes, the dataset is oversimplified by eliminating the DRG splitting
criteria, thus going against the spirit of the DRG codes. Conﬂating
DRGs regardless of this second letter coding would introduce bias in
the results; for example, handling both B70A and B70D as B70
would consider ‘Stroke and Other Cerebrovascular Disorders,
Major Complexity’ and ‘Stroke and Other Cerebrovascular
Disorders, Transferred <5 Days’ as the same entity. This is another
potential misleading factor when interpreting findings and conclu-
sions from this article’s data analysis, because the final results could
be affected by the criteria applied in the selection of the DRG code.

Moreover, the wording used in different sections of this article
makes it difficult to interpret its contribution, or even to determine
whether the described method aims to ‘develop a framework which
allows the health practitioner to understand the available patient in-
formation’, ‘predict future diagnosis’ or ‘predict next admission’. In
any case the results reported in this article could well be interpreted
by future readers operating under the assumption that the correct
codification was applied in the analyses. If indeed the analysis in this
article has used a coding system that was not designed for diagnos-
tics representation and related purposes, the claims associated with
the ability of the method to predict the first future diagnosis or prog-
nosis—as per the results section of the abstract and the conclusion
section of the article—are not supported by the data. Instead the
method at best would suggest the first future episode of care (which
is captured already in DRG codes).

However, even allowing this interpretation and accepting that
the aim is hospital admissions pattern discovery in electronic health
records using DRG codes, the article still requires a more detailed
explanation of the dataset used. For instance, if it spanned a period
of years (as could be inferred from the existence of patients with

hundreds and thousands of admissions in Figure 4a) it might have
used different versions of the DRG codes. Hence the methods should
have explained how the consolidation of these different versions was
addressed.

The article claims that this system outperforms previous
approaches in the literature but does not present any support for
this claim. Given our comments above on coding system/s, it might
well be that this comparison rests on tools and methods based in
analysis of different coding systems for different purposes, making
the comparisons of performance meaningless. The only comparisons
presented in this article are between the proposed method and a
Markov model developed by the same author (similar to those pre-
sented in his reference 3, Arandjelovic, 2015a, b).

For us to do a more detailed analysis in the interests of replicat-
ing this study would have required access to the original dataset.
Despite the journal policy encouraging dataset publication, we
understand if the dataset cannot be made available due to ethical
and confidentiality issues associated with the secondary use of data
extracted from clinical records. For this very reason, it is concerning
to note that this article lacks any mention of ethical approval or pro-
cedures used for data anonymization, nor even acknowledgement of
the original data source.

This article’s disregard for the meaning of clinical codes, its loose
use of key healthcare terminology (the term ‘admission’ is indis-
tinctly used referring to codes, admission causes, diagnosis and ap-
parently even for actual hospital admission events) and its critical
omission of key information about the health data source all
emphasize the need for greater collaboration between the bioinfor-
matics and medical informatics communities to advance research of
this kind. This is essential to ensure that there is fundamental under-
standing of the context where data are derived and where new meth-
ods and systems will be applied.

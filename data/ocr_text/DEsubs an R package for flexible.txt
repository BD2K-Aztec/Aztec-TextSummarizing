Abstract

Summary: DEsubs is a network-based systems biology R package that extracts disease-perturbed
subpathways within a pathway network as recorded by RNA-seq experiments. It contains an exten-
sive and customized framework with a broad range of operation modes at all stages of the subpath-
way analysis, enabling so a case-specific approach. The operation modes include pathway network
construction and processing, subpathway extraction, visualization and enrichment analysis with re-
gard to various biological and pharmacological features. Its capabilities render it as a tool-guide for
both the modeler and experimentalist for the identification of more robust systems-level drug targets
and biomarkers for complex diseases.

Availability and implementation: DEsubs is implemented as an R package following Bioconductor

guidelines (permanently available in URL: http://biosignalmed.upatras.gr/wordpress/desubs).

1 Introduction

In the last years, systems-level network-based approaches have gained
ground in the research ﬁeld of systems biology (Leung et al., 2013).
Towards this direction the research community has been focusing on the
analysis of subpathways, namely local gene sub-regions within a path-
way network (Chen et al., 2011). Approaches in this direction are essen-
tial for identifying more accurate system-level drug targets and bi-
omarkers for complex diseases by monitoring the local functions of
networks perturbed by diseases (Barabasi et al., 2011). Hence, several
subpathway-based tools have been developed recently focusing though
predominantly on differentially expressed (DE) genes (Haynes et al.,
2013; Martini et al., 2012; Nam et al., 2014; Li et al., 2009; Li et al.,

2012; Li et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Judeh et al., 2013; Zhang et al.,
2014; Vrahatis et al., 2016).

Meanwhile, since the amount of RNA-seq transcriptome studies is
increasing rapidly year by year, there is high demand for tailored differ-
ential expression (DE) analysis tools. Although most DE tools are crucial
components in pathway analysis workﬂows, there is a gap in addressing
this issue through an extensive and customized subpathway-based ap-
proach using DE analysis for RNA-seq data.

Towards this orientation, we developed an R package, called DE-
subs, which extracts differentially expressed subpathways based on
RNA-seq expression proﬁles enabling so a customized analysis to the
problem under investigation through numerous operation modes. DEsubs
offers a systematic way to uncover the local perturbations within a net-

work that could lead to human diseases through differentially expressed
subpathways.

2 Methods

2.1 Pathway network construction

All available organism-speciﬁc KEGG pathway maps are converted to a
pathway network, maintaining both their topology and information ﬂow
(Vrahatis et al., 2016). Organism level networks are constructed by
joining all related processed graphs based on the user-input list of genes.
DEsubs operates for six well-known organisms three pathway types and
several gene label systems (for details see package vignette).

A. Pathway Network Construction

2.2 Pathway network processing

Next, the RNA-seq data are mapped onto the nodes and edges of the
pathway network. Two pruning rules are used to isolate robust and vali-
dated interactions (edges) among statistically signiﬁcant differentially
expressed genes (DEGs). NodeRule selects the core set of genes with
statistically signiﬁcant differential expression and EdgeRule further
prunes the interactions among these genes according to prior biological
evidence.

More speciﬁcally, DEGs are identiﬁed using any of the eight well-
established DE tools (edgeR, DESeq, NBPSeq, TSPM, voom, vst, SAM-
seq, EBSeq) by considering the FDR-adjusted P-value of each gene
(Qvalue) based on the work of (Soneson et al., 2013). For a graph
G(V, E) with V nodes andE edges, the NodeRule is as follows:
NodeRule: Qvalue(i) < threshold, Vi E V(G). Among the edges of

Fig. 1. DEsubs overview. (A) User inputs the RNA-seq control-case expression dataset and selects the organism, the gene label system and the pathway type and subse-

quently the appropriate pathway network is constructed. (B) The pathway network processing is based on two pruning rules by retaining the statistically signiﬁcant DEGs

(NodeRule) and interactions which are in accordance with the ﬂow of information imposed by KEGG pathway maps (EdgeRule). Pruning rules are applied through several

user-defmed DE tools and correlation measures. (C) Subpathways are extracted ﬁom the processed pathway network based on a broad range of sub-structures, resulting in

124 extraction types in total. (D) A hypergeometric test is used to estimate the subpathway’s associations with various biological and pharmacological features. (E) The

enriched associations of a subpathway to each feature are illustrated using several visualization schemes. Furthermore, by zooming in and out of subpathways, DEsubs pro-

vides a customized View of the resulting subpathways ﬁom the gene up to organism level. Heat maps, circular diagrams, dot plots, bar plots and graph plots are supported.

isolated genes, we highlight those where the expression proﬁles of the
adjacent genes comply with prior biological knowledge. These are edges
with highly positive or negative correlated adjacent gene expression
proﬁles and are considered a priori as edges with activating (reg = 1)
or suppressing (reg = —1) regulation role based on KEGG pathway
maps (Vrahatis et al., 2016). The correlation is estimated based on cor
value which uses any of the three well-established correlation measures
(Pearson, Spearman, Kendall). For a pair of interacting gene nodes i, j
the rule is formulated as follows: EdgeRule: cor(i, j) * reg(i, j) >
threshold, V (i, j) E E (G). The thresholds are user-deﬁned and the
default values are 0.05 and 0.7 respectively. For more details, see pack-
age vignette.

2.3 Subpathway extraction

The processed pathway network is subsequently frittered based on ﬁve
main topological structures. We extract (i) group of genes sharing com-
mon roles or properties within the graph (communities), (ii) strongly
connected genes (components), (iii) gene streams, (iv) cascades and (v)
neighborhoods. The three latter types are generated starting from a gene
of interest with speciﬁc topological or functional properties within the
network. From this point on, subpathways are generated following either
forward or backward propagation. Thus, the user can observe the local
perturbations within the network starting from (or ending to) different
points of interest through various topological schemes. As a result, a
total of 124 different extraction types are supported thus providing the
user with a broad repertoire of the sub-structures existing within the
pathways. To assess the performance of DEsubs, we examine all opera-
tion modes based on synthetic benchmark data and provide guidelines
for the user to select the appropriate parameter setting. For detailed de-
scription in the subpathway extraction stage, see package vignette.

2.4 Subpathway enrichment analysis

The extracted subpathways are ﬁirther examined for enrichment in vari-
ous biological and pharmacological features. A hypergeometric test is
used to estimate the subpathway associations with (i) pathway terms, (ii)
gene ontology (GO) terms of molecular ﬁinction, biological processes
and cellular components, (iii) disease terms, (iv) drug substances, (v)
microRNA targets and (vi) transcription factors. The aforementioned
associations are extracted from seven databases (KEGG, GO,
miRecords, Transfac, Jaspar, GAD, OMIM, DrugBank) using the ap-
proach of (Bameh et al., 2015; Chen et al., 2013; Li et al., 2011; Vra-
hatis et al., 2015). For details see package vignette.

2.5 Visualization

The enriched associations of a subpathway to each feature are illustrated
through circular diagrams. Furthermore, by zooming in and out of sub-
pathways, DEsubs provides a customizable view of the resulting sub-
pathways from the gene up to organism level. Feature-rich genes are
imprinted in bar plots and heat maps. Also, the resulted subpathways
along with their associations to biological and pharmacological features
are summarized in dot plots providing a comprehensive illustration of
each experiment (see package vignette).

3 Conclusion

DEsubs R package is a ﬂexible, computationally fast and efﬁcient tool
(see supplementary ﬁle) for exploring disease-associated gene perturba-
tions contextualized by subpathways in a graph-theoretic framework.
The numerous operation modes provide the user a highly customizable
setup, rendering the package as a guide for the systematic exploration of
the local subpathways within a pathway network perturbed by disease.

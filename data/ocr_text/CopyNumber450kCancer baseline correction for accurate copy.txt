Abstract

The Illumina lnfinium HumanMethylation450 BeadChip (450k) is widely used for the evaluation of DNA
methylation levels in large—scale datasets, particularly in cancer. The 450k design allows copy number
variant (CNV) calling using existing bioinformatics tools. However, in cancer samples, numerous large—
scale aberrations cause shifting in the probe intensities and thereby may result in erroneous CNV call—
ing. Therefore, a baseline correction process is needed. We suggest the maximum peak of probe seg—
ment density to correct the shift in the intensities in cancer samples.

Availability and implementation: CopyNumber450kCancer is implemented as an R package.
The package with examples can be downloaded at http://cran.r—project.org.

1 Introduction

DNA methylation is the most studied epigenetic modification in can—
cer and many other diseases. Many technologies and platforms have
been developed to facilitate DNA methylation analysis, such as
bisulphite conversion followed by analysis using DNA methylation
arrays. The Illumina Infinium HumanMethylation45 0 BeadChip
(450k) provides detection of methylation levels of approximately
485000 CpG loci across the human genome (Sandoval et 61]., 2011).
The 45 0k platform is based on similar biochemical reaction prin-
ciple and technology as the Infinium SNP arrays, making it possible
to use the 45 0k platform to detect copy number variants (CNVs) as a
zero—cost byproduct of methylation studies (Feber et 61]., 2014).
Recently, bioinformatics tools were developed for copy number (CN)
calling from methylation data (e.g. ChAMP (Morris et 61]., 2014),
CopyNumber450k and conumee (www.bioconductor.org)).

CN calling consists of the following principal steps: normalization
of probe intensities, calculation of the Log R Ratios (LRRs), segmen—
tation and determination of copy number status for each segment
based on a chosen cutoff level or a P—value threshold. In each step dif—
ferent algorithms, methods and parameters can be applied. However,
in cancer samples the large and numerous chromosomal duplications
and deletions cause a shift in the LRRs away from the hypothetical
baseline level (i.e. 2n/diploid level) resulting in erroneous CNV call—
ing. The conventional normalization methods (e.g. Quantile and
Functional normalization (Fortin et 61]., 2014)) as well as the median/
average sample centering cannot overcome this problem. A similar
centering problem was observed in copy number calling from array-
based Comparative Genomic Hybridization (aCGH) data for cancer
samples. The density of the probes was suggested to help determine

the center of the samples and avoid erroneous CNV calls (Lipson
et 61]., 2007). However, to date there is no tool available to resolve
this problem in CN data derived from the 45 0k array.

2 Description

To resolve the cancer—specific problem of erroneous CN calling in
data derived from the 45 0k array, we provide a freely available R
package denoted CopyNumber450kCancer that can run on all oper-
ating systems with installed R (version > 3.0) and provides a novel
functionality to correct the center in segmentation data obtained
from CN calling tools such as CopyNumber450k and ChAMP.

3 Baseline estimation

For the baseline estimation we assumed that the majority of the probes
are located close to the correct baseline. Therefore a density function
based on segments (weighted on the number of probes) should show
maximum peak at the correct baseline. For the correction, the sample
log values are shifted in an amount equal to the difference between the
sample baseline and the maximum peak level (Fig. 1). We call this
method Maximum Density Peak Estimation (MDPE). MDPE avoids
the challenges and limitations facing the CN calling from 450k data,
such as the absence of B—allele frequency that is available from
SNP genotyping arrays. CopyNumber450kCancer has a function
for manual revision where samples with inaccurate automatic baseline
determination can be interactively corrected.

To assess the accuracy of the correction method, we performed the
auto—correction for 764 public acute lymphoblastic leukemia samples
(Nordlund et 61]., 2013). All the generated plots (Supplementary 1 and
2) were manually reviewed in comparison to the karyotyping data.

Fig. 1. The upper plot shows the CN calling from a cancer sample by
CopyNumber450k (first 3 chromosomes shown). The segments above the cut-
off represent amplifications, and the segments under the cutoff represent dele-
tions. The horizontal lines represent the cutoffs and the zero level (i.e.
baseline). The lower panel shows the segments after the baseline correction
by CopyNumber450kCancer

The auto—correction changed the baseline for 760 samples,
the rest 4 samples (0.5%) had correct baseline without any changes.
For 740 samples (96.9%) the auto—correction was correct. Manual
modification was needed for 20 samples (2.6%). The difference be—
tween the corrected and uncorrected CN data was significant in all
the cytogenetic subtypes (Supp. 3).

4 Input and output

CopyNumber450kCancer uses a simple input data structure
that can be generated by a wide range of segmentation tools. The
package requires two input files. The first file contains the genomic
regions for all samples with log values and number of the probes
in each segment. The second file contains the samples names.
To facilitate the analysis, the tool can directly read the segmentation
output file from the CopyNumber450k package.

CopyNumber450kCancer generates a corrected segmentation
file, corrected plots, a QC file and a baseline shifting file.

5 Quality control

There is no well—defined quality control (QC) standard for 450k
data segmentation. Therefore we selected QC standards developed
for SNP array data. A QC file is generated with the following SNP
QC standards for each sample; InterQuartile Range (IQR),
Median Absolute Pairwise Difference (MAPD), number of seg—
ments and standard deviation (SD). An additional QC measure—
ment called Maximum Density Peak Sharpness (MDPS) is also
reported. The QC values are calculated based on the log values of
the segments instead of the individual probes.
CopyNumber450kCancer does not provide any fixed QC thresh-
olds as they may differ from one experiment to another and are
also dependent on the type of analysis. The user can use the QC
file to exclude samples that have low quality QC values. However,
we strongly recommend the visual reviewing option in order to
recognize low—quality samples.

6 Interactive revision

CopyNumber450kCancer provides graphical interactive plots as an
option to supervise/review the baseline estimation. The user can se—
lect a log ratio interval wherein the baseline should be located. For
the reviewing step, we strongly recommend to use any external sam—
ple information (e.g. karyotyping) that can help the user decide the
correct baseline.

The package comes with example files that can be run directly
for auto—correction and interactive revision:

7 Conclusion

CN calling from the 45 0k data is possible, but faces some difficulties in
some cancer samples due to incorrect sample centering and baseline
shifting. Without solving this issue the CN calling will be inaccurate. We

successfully tested the MDPE method on 45 0k cancer segmentation
data. CopyNumber450kCancer package implements the MDPE method
together with interactive reviewing to efficiently correct the baseline in
cancer samples. The main advantages for CopyNumber450kCancer
are: fast auto—correction (few seconds per sample), high accuracy rate,
in—sample correction, no input parameters needed, low computer re—
sources required and adaptable to 45 0k—similar technologies.

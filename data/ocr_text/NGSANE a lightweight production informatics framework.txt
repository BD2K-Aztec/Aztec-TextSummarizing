ABSTRACT

Summary: The initial steps in the analysis of next-generation sequen-
cing data can be automated by way of software ‘pipelines’. However,
individual components depreciate rapidly because of the evolving
technology and analysis methods, often rendering entire versions of
production informatics pipelines obsolete. Constructing pipelines from
Linux bash commands enables the use of hot swappable modular
components as opposed to the more rigid program call wrapping by
higher level languages, as implemented in comparable published pipe-
lining systems.

Here we present Next Generation Sequencing ANalysis for Enterprises
(NGSANE), a Linux-based, high-performance-computing-enabled
framework that minimizes overhead for set up and processing of
new projects, yet maintains full flexibility of custom scripting when
processing raw sequence data.

Availability and implementation: NGSANE is implemented in bash and
publicly available under BSD (3-Clause) licence via GitHub at https://
github.com/BauerLab/ngsane.

1 INTRODUCTION

The initial steps of analyzing next-generation sequencing (NGS)
data can be automated in standardized pipelines, for e.g. the
many steps in SNP calling and RNA-Seq analysis (Anders
et al., 2013). This is critical, as further decreasing sequencing
costs and expanding use of replicates to assess biological vari-
ability (Auer and Doerge, 2010) will substantially increase future
study sizes, therefore making the automated, documented and
reproducible processing of large numbers of samples across di-
verse projects using high—performance computing (HPC) clusters
paramount. Yet, because of the constantly evolving technology,
software and new application areas, maintaining such pro-
duction informatics pipelines can be labor intensive.

To address this issue, several software packages have been
published in recent years. However, currently available tools

are either web-based services, e.g. Galaxy (Goecks et al., 2010),
where even API-based access to the web service functionality is
not readily amenable to production-scale analysis practices, or
heavyweight frameworks written in user-friendly languages, such
as SNAKEMAKE and NESTLY (Python) (Koster and Rahmann, 2012;
McCoy et al., 2013), GATK’s QUEUE (Scala) — https://github.
com/broadgsa/gatk/) or BPIPE (Groovy) (Sadedin et al., 2012),
which encapsulate the actual program call in a wrapper script
speciﬁc syntax, hindering the development of pipeline extensions.

NGSANE is a lightweight, Linux-based, HPC-enabled frame-
work that minimizes overhead for set up and processing of
new projects, yet maintains full flexibility of custom scripting
for processing raw sequence data. NGSANE allows end users
and developers to construct pipelines from call statements that
can be tested on the command line directly without syntax alter-
ations or wrapper script involvement providing flexibility in soft-
ware usage — a substantial advantage when analysis pipelines are
constantly revised as new algorithms are developed. We describe
NGSANE’s aims below.

Data security and reusability. The framework separates pro-
ject-speciﬁc files from reference data, scripts and software suites
that are reusable in other projects (Fig. la). Access to confiden-
tial data is handled transparently via the underlying Linux per-
mission system. The transaction between projects and framework
is facilitated by a project-speciﬁc configuration file that defines
paths to reference data as well as the analysis tasks to perform.
NGSANE supports systems with hierarchical storage management,
speciﬁcally Data Migration Facility, by ensuring files are online
when needed.

HPC and parallel execution. NGSANE supports Sun Grid
Engine and Portable Batch System job scheduling and can be
operated in different modes for development and production,
thus enabling ﬂexible processing of NGS data. HPC job parti-
tioning and submission is independent from the program calls,
therefore enabling new technologies (e.g. Hadoop) to be
incorporated.

Hot swapping and adaptability. Individual task blocks (e.g.
read mapping) are packaged in bash script modules, which can
be executed locally or on subsets to test module code, submission
parameters and compute node environment in stages. During
production, NGSANE automatically submits separate module
calls for each input ﬁle or set of files to the HPC queue. This
allows different existing modules, parameter settings or software

versions to be executed by changes to the project-speciﬁc conﬁg-
uration ﬁle rather than the software code (hot swapping).

Reproducibility and checkpoint recovery. A full audit trail is
generated recording performed tasks, used reference data, time-
stamps, software version as well as HPC log ﬁles, including any
errors. NGSANE gracefully recovers from unsuccessfully executed
jobs, be it owing to failed commands, missing or incorrect input
or under-resourced HPC jobs by cleanly restarting after the most
recent successfully executed checkpoint.

Robust execution and full monitoring. In our experience, modu-
lar workﬁows are executed in stages with optional human quality
control; NSANE hence focuses on providing robust checkpoint-
ing and intuitive report generation (Fig. lb). However, work-
ﬁows can be fully automated by using NGSANE’s control
over HPC queuing systems and by leveraging the customizable
interfaces between modules when submitting multiple dependent
stages at once.

Automated project summary creation. NGSANE generates a
high-level summary (Project Card, Fig. lb and c) to enable in-
formed decisions about the experimental success. This interactive
HTML report provides an access point for new lab members or
collaborators. Furthermore, the Project Card can be used as a
gold standard for software development when using a continu-
ous integration server.

Complete customization. NGSANE’s conﬁguration ﬁle contains
details about the submission system, typical HPC resource allo-
cations and location of third-party software. However, NGSANE’s
credo is that every parameter can be overwritten; hence, default
parameters can be adjusted in the project-speciﬁc conﬁguration
ﬁle to indicate different software versions, additional resources
or an altered output location. Additional parameters, such as a
speciﬁc HPC queue, or new parameters in a software release, can
be provided to each program via a special ‘free form’ variable in
the conﬁguration ﬁle.

Repeated calls. As stated by McCoy et al. (2013), pipelines
often have to be rerun on the full or a subset of the data with
possibly altered parameter settings. NGSANE facilitates and docu-
ments this by allowing multiple (automatically created) conﬁg-
uration ﬁles.

Knowledge transfer. NGSANE provides a uniﬁed framework
(i.e. folder structure) for processing data from different experi-
mental protocols. This allows co-investigators and reviewers to

easily understand and reproduce work from NGSANE’s log and
report ﬁles.

NGSANE is open source and available via GitHub. Currently
implemented workﬂows include those for adapter trimming, read
mapping, peak calling, motif discovery, transcript assembly, vari-
ant calling and chromatin conformation analysis. These work-
ﬁows use publicly available published software, yet allow the end
user to add his/her own code and create new workﬁows as
required. NGSANE is also available as Amazon Machine Image
and can be deployed to the Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud
(EC2) using STARCLUSTER to allow on-demand processing of
samples without requiring software installation or HPC
maintenance.

Abstract

Summary: High-throughput genotyping and sequencing technologies facilitate studies of complex
genetic traits and provide new research opportunities. The increasing popularity of genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) leads to the discovery of new associated loci and a better understand-
ing of the genetic architecture underlying not only diseases, but also other monogenic and com-
plex phenotypes. Several softwares are available for performing GWAS analyses, R environment
being one of them.

Results: We present cgmisc, an R package that enables enhanced data analysis and visualization of
results from GWAS. The package contains several utilities and modules that complement and
enhance the functionality of the existing software. It also provides several tools for advanced visu-
alization of genomic data and utilizes the power of the R language to aid in preparation of
publication-quality figures. Some of the package functions are specific for the domestic dog
(Canis familiaris) data.

Availability and implementation: The package is operating system-independent and is available
from: https://github.com/cgmisc-team/cgmisc

1 Introduction

 

High-throughput genotyping and sequencing has opened several
new research opportunities to study complex genetic traits and gen-
ome-wide association studies (GWAS) is a popular way to analyse
genotyping data from segregating populations. Widely used GWAS
softwares include PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007), EMMAX (Kang
et al., 2010), GCTA (Yang et al., 2011) and GenABEL (Aulchenko
et al., 2007). A single software package is rarely sufficiently com-
plete to cover all aspects of a typical genome-wide analysis pipeline.
Transferring data between different softwares is often a laborious

process. One advantage of the GenABEL package, that often makes
it the software of choice, is that in addition to GWAS-specific func-
tionalities, it provides access to the R (R Development Core Team,
2008) language and community-contributed packages. Here we de-
veloped a number of algorithms and solutions to several common
GWAS tasks. Some of these solutions aim at facilitating production
of publication-quality data/results visualization (see, e.g. Fig. 1).
Several cgmisc functions have been used to produce results and visu-
alizations for peer-reviewed publications, e.g. Tengvall et al., 2013,
Owczarek-Lipska et al., 2012 and Olsson et al., 2013. Here, we

2 Description

cgmisc (ver. 2.9.10), provides 34 functions for the analysis and visu-
alization of GWAS data. A few functions in the package are tailored
for working with data from the domestic dog (Canis familiaris) but
are easy to adjust for analysing other species. Some functions rely on
third-party softwares which are freely available for research pur-
poses. Internally, cgmisc functions use data structures implemented
in the GenABEL package. For all functions and parameters in the
package, we use the period-separated naming convention (Baath,
2012). Functions provided by the cgmisc package can be grouped
into the following categories:

° Analyses of population structure. Population strata can be com-
pared based on their allele-frequency differences, using either (i)
ﬁxation index FST or (ii) Fisher’s exact test for reference allele
count observed versus the allele count expected under the null
hypothesis of no population structure.

° Tools related to association scans. Enhanced quantile—quantile
(qq) plot showing (i) theoretical and (ii) empirical conﬁdence
intervals as well as (iii) empirical signiﬁcance thresholds. We also
implemented an extended version of the Manhattan plot, with
colour-coded information on linkage disequilibrium (LD) be-
tween a selected marker and its neighbours plus a minor-allele
frequency panel. Easy ways of interfacing variance GWAS scans
(vGWAS; Shen et al., 2012) and bigRR (Shen et al., 2013) pack-
ages (BLUP, ridge regression) as well as simple visualization of
per-genotype distribution of phenotypic values are provided. We
also complement the standard tests for association with a basic
scan for gene-gene interaction (epistasis).

° Heterozygosity analyses. We provide functions for the detection
and visualization of runs of homozygosity along the genome to
facilitate the detection of suggestive selective sweeps and high-
light regions that may be challenging for standard association
mapping tools.

° Analyses and visualization of linkage structure. The cgmisc package
provides tools for assessing average haplotype lengths by visual-
ization of LD-decay as a function of the distance between markers.
In addition, the package offers export functions that enable haplo-
type phasing using PHASE (Stephens et al., 2001) and haplotype
visualization using Haploview (Barrett et al., 2005). In addition, we
implemented the marker clumping procedure used by PLINK.

° Improved annotation. The package provides functions for gen-
ome annotation in the domestic dog (Canis familiaris,

canFam3.1 assembly), offers the direct interaction with the
UCSC Genome Browser (Kuhn et al., 2013) and improved ana-
lyses of pseudo-autosomal regions on the X chromosome. In add-
ition, we provide a convenient method for retrieving and plotting
information on endogenous retroviral sequences identiﬁed by the
RetroTector software (Sperber et al., 2007).

° Data subsetting, manipulation and visualization. cgmisc can gen-
erate windows for sliding-window (also with overlap) and jump-
ing-window type analyses. A number of convenience functions
enables users to, e.g. retrieve information about LD or chromo-
some start/end point coordinates.

All functions were designed to be user-friendly with attention to
the quality of visualizations. Complete documentation is available
upon cgmisc installation. In order to facilitate package usage, we
included a quick tutorial (package vignette in the supplementary in-
formation) that takes the user through all steps necessary to use each
of the package functions. The tutorial is based on the included ex-
ample dataset. A detailed description of the methods and algorithms
used by the functions is provided in the vignette and documentation.

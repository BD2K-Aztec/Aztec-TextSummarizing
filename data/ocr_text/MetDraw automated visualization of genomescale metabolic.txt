ABSTRACT

Motivation: Metabolic reaction maps allow visualization of genome-
scale models and high-throughput data in a format familiar to many
biologists. However, creating a map of a large metabolic model is a
difficult and time-consuming process. MetDraw fully automates the
map-drawing process for metabolic models containing hundreds to
thousands of reactions. MetDraw can also overlay high-throughput
‘omics’ data directly on the generated maps.

Availability and implementation: Web interface and source code are
freely available at http://www.metdraw.com.

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The number of genome-scale metabolic models has increased
greatly in recent years (Oberhardt et al., 2009). An accompany-
ing expansion in available algorithms for analyzing these models
in the context of high-throughput data (Lewis et al., 2012) has
created the need for tools to visualize large models and datasets.
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003) and similar graph-drawing soft-
ware can visualize arbitrary biological networks. However, the
resulting node-and—edge graphs are visually distinct from
the more familiar ‘metabolic map’ layout where lines show the
ﬂow of reactants coming together before branching into prod-
ucts. Only a few genome-scale metabolic reconstructions include
a manually curated visualization. However, producing these
maps is difﬁcult and time-consuming, and the maps are rarely
updated as the model is revised.

The Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG)
(Kanehisa et al., 2012) and other metabolic pathway databases
provide visualizations of indexed reactions, but these maps ex-
clude reactions not in the database (such as transport or species-
speciﬁc reactions). Metabolic modeling software packages such
as the COBRA Toolbox (Schellenberger et al., 2011) and
CellNetAnalyzer (Klamt et al., 2007) can overlay ﬂux and gene
expression data on reaction maps. Although both packages allow
users to modify existing maps, no software package is capable of

a set of reactions.

2 FEATURES

We present MetDraw, an online tool and software package for
automatically generating a reaction map for genome-scale meta-
bolic reconstructions. MetDraw also allows users to visualize
metabolomic, reaction ﬂux and gene/protein expression data dir-
ectly on the resulting maps. Maps are created from Systems
Biology Markup Language (SBML) model ﬁles and exported
as Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) images. This widely accepted
image format allows users to easily customize details of the ﬁnal
maps with image editing software. Although the map creation
process is completely automated, several features allow users to
control the drawing output.

2.1 Input

MetDraw begins with a valid SBML ﬁle of the metabolic recon-
struction. The SBML ﬁle can be uploaded to the MetDraw Web
site (http://www.metdraw.com), or the software can be run on a
local computer. MetDraw allows compartmentalized models
with transport reactions spanning multiple compartments. For
optimal layouts, the SBML ﬁle should also contain subsystem
assignments in the ‘notes’ section of several reactions. These des-
ignations are used to partition the smaller subgraphs that can be
visualized more easily.

Metabolites are designated as ‘major’ or ‘minor’ depending on
the number of reactions involving each species. Major metabolites
are drawn once in each compartment with arrows denoting how
the species is produced or consumed by each reaction. Minor, or
currency, metabolites are those that appear in many reactions, e. g.
high-energy phosphates, water, protons and common metabolic
cofactors. Minor metabolites are redrawn for each reaction rather
than being drawn once per subsystem and shared by multiple
reactions. The removal of minor metabolites reduces much of
the visual clutter caused by these highly connected species.
MetDraw identiﬁes minor metabolites by thresholding metabol-
ite/reaction participation counts. Optionally, MetDraw will export
a list of reaction counts for each metabolite and allow the user to
designate the minor metabolites manually.

2.2 Layout

If subsystem designations are available for any reactions,
MetDraw partitions the corresponding reactions. Small subsys-
tems or subsystems that share nearly all reactions with other

subsystems are merged to preserve information ﬂow in the ﬁnal
map. Subsystems and unclassiﬁed reactions are then placed into
compartments. Transport reactions, reactions with reactants in
more than one compartment, are identiﬁed and separated for
layout across the compartment boundaries.

The ﬁnal layout uses the widely used Graphviz (Gansner and
North, 2000) software. MetDraw converts the reactions to a
series of edges and nodes using the Graphviz DOT language.
Unlike other graph-drawing programs for biological networks,
MetDraw inserts invisible nodes and edges and uses multiple
graph elements to create a ﬁnal layout that more closely resem-
bles a classical biochemical map (Fig. 1A).

Even after identifying minor metabolites and partitioning the
reactions by subsystem, the resulting graph may still contain
several overlapping edges that clutter the map. MetDraw at-
tempts to alleviate these problem areas by identifying major me-
tabolites that are more highly connected than other metabolites
in the same subsystem. These metabolites are ‘cloned’ and
redrawn several times in the subsystem to spread the layout
and remove overlapping reactions. The cloned metabolites are
connected with a dashed line to aid viewing.

Compartments are bounded by a box and labeled in the ﬁnal
image. Subsystems can either be bounded in a similar manner or
left free for tighter packing of the compartment. Transport reac-
tions are added to visualize mass ﬂow between compartments.

Additional details on the MetDraw layout algorithm are
included in the Supplementary Methods.

2.3 Output and data visualization

By default, MetDraw exports an SVG image of the reconstruc-
tion. This format is compatible with MetDraw’s data visualiza-
tion features. MetDraw can also export visualization in any
other format supported by Graphviz, including PDF, PNG
and EPS. Final changes to the layout can be made with a
vector graphic editing program. Users can freely add graphical
elements or move metabolites and reactions; the resulting images
can still be used to visualize data with MetDraw.

MetDraw allows visualization of ﬁuxomic, metabolomic and
gene/protein expression data on metabolic maps. MetDraw

accepts a text ﬁle containing numerical data for each metabolite
or reaction over several conditions. These data are normalized,
applied to a colormap and overlayed on a previously generated
metabolic map (Fig. 1B). If several conditions are given in the
same data ﬁle, MetDraw creates a separate image for each con-
dition using the same color scale. These images can be combined
for visual comparisons and to animate transient conditions.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

MetDraw is written in Python 2.7 and runs on Linux, Microsoft
Windows and Mac OS X. MetDraw requires Graphviz 2.28 or
later. An online interface is available at http: //www.metdraw.com.

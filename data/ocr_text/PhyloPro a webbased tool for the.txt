ABSTRACT

Summary: With increasing numbers of eukaryotic genome
sequences, phylogenetic profiles of eukaryotic genes are becoming
increasingly informative. Here, we introduce a new web-tool
Phylopro (http://compsysbio.org/phy|opro/), which uses the 120
available eukaryotic genome sequences to visualize the evolutionary
trajectories of user-defined subsets of model organism genes.
Applied to pathways or complexes, PhyloPro allows the user to
rapidly identify core conserved elements of biological processes
together with those that may represent lineage-specific innovations.
PhyloPro thus provides a valuable resource for the evolutionary and
comparative studies of biological systems.

In its simplest form, a phylogenetic proﬁle is simply a pattern
denoting the presence or absence of a homolog across a set of
species. Previous studies have shown that genes sharing similar
functions often have similar phylogenetic proﬁles, a phenomenon
that has been exploited in various gene function prediction
algorithms (Date and Marcotte, 2005; von Mering et al., 2007). Due
to a lack of eukaryotic genomes, analyses involving phylogenetic
proﬁles have typically been restricted to bacteria. However,
the generation of increasing numbers of eukaryotic genomes is
beginning to allow more meaningful comparisons of proﬁles across
the Eukarya. In addition to function prediction, these proﬁles may
be usefully exploited to explore the evolutionary trajectories of
sets of genes that operate in related processes (Gabaldon, 2008;
On et al., 2010; Persaud et al., 2009). Such system—based analyses
can help identify both conserved genes that represent ancestral core
elements of a pathway or complex, as well as those providing
taxon—speciﬁc innovations (Hulsen et al., 2009). Here we introduce
PhyloPro, a web—based tool that provides a user—friendly portal for
the Visualization of pre—computed phylogenetic proﬁles for sets
of genes deﬁned by the user. Through the implementation of a
clustering step, genes are grouped on the basis of their phylogenetic
proﬁles. These groupings are then Visualized through a java—based
interface that facilitates the ready delineation of genes restricted to
speciﬁc lineages.

Focusing on the six model organisms: Arabadopsis thaliana
(plant), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (yeast), Caenorhabditis elegans
(worm), Drosophila melanogaster (ﬂy), Mus musculus (mouse)
and Homo sapiens (human), the Inparanoid algorithm (Remm
et al., 2001) was used to perform pairwise homology searches for
each model species against 120 eukaryotes for which a complete
genome sequence has been generated. These comprise 5 plant
species, 30 protozoa, 26 fungi, 2 ‘basal’ metazoa, 7 nematodes,
17 arthropods, 2 chordates, 7 vertebrates and 24 mammals. The
use of Inparanoid readily facilitates the identiﬁcation of so—
called in—paralogs representing lineage—speciﬁc gene duplication
events. Given a list of query genes from a model species (the
‘query’ species), for each ‘target’ species, we deﬁne one of ﬁve
possible homology relationship: no detectable ortholog; 1:1—a
single query gene has a single ortholog in the target species;
1:Many—a single query gene has two or more orthologs in the
target species; Many:1—a query gene together with at least one
additional paralog are orthologs of a single gene in the target
species; and Many:Many—a query gene together with at least
one additional paralog are orthologs of at least two orthologs in
the target species genome. The collation of these relationships for
each of the 120 target species deﬁnes a phylogenetic proﬁle for
each query gene which is stored in a local PostgreSQL database
(http://www.postgresql.org).

PhyloPro is simple to use, and can be completed in ﬁve steps:
(i) input of query genes; (ii) selection of target species; (iii) data
retrieval and clustering; (iv) Visualization; and (v) data download.
Users begin by entering a list of sequence identiﬁers. These
can include gene symbols (e.g. for worm ‘mek—2’), entrez gene
identiﬁers (IDs) (e.g. ‘171872’), protein IDs (e.g. ‘CE25437’), open
reading frame (ORF) names (e. g. ‘Y54E10BL.6’) or other organism—
speciﬁc terms (e. g. ‘WBGENG00003186’). Sequence identiﬁers can
be entered directly into a text box or uploaded as a ﬁle. Next, the
user selects the target species from a series of nine expandable
taxonomy groups highlighted above. Finally, the user is given the
option of changing two parameters associated with the clustering
algorithm. After reviewing user input and options, the phylogenetic
proﬁles of each query gene is retrieved from the database and
clustered using the tool Cluster 3.0 (Eisen et al., 1998). Users are
then presented with a Visualization of their results which features
an interactive heatmap of orthology relationships (Fig. 1). Within
the heatmap the order of the 120 eukaryotes is predeﬁned. The
heatmap can be downloaded as a Portable Network Graphic (PNG)

relationship between the query gene and the target species: black, no ortholog detected; orange, 1:1 relationship; yellow, 1:M relationship; dark blue, M:1
relationship and light blue indicates M:M relationship. Mousing over tiles indicates the query gene and target species. Clicking colored tiles allows the IDs
and sequences of the query and orthologous genes to be shown in a pop—up window. (A—D) Groups of genes with distinct patterns of conservation—see main

or tab—delimited text ﬁle. Users may also download the list of
all orthologs shown in the heatmap. Figure 1 shows a typical
application of PhyloPro, visualizing the phylogenetic proﬁles of 86
yeast genes associated with the cell cycle. From the heatmap, four
groups of genes with speciﬁc patterns of orthology relationship are
readily delineated: (A) highly conserved across all 120 Eukarya;
(B) fungal—speciﬁc innovations; (C) duplications in vertebrates; and
(D) duplications in yeast. PhyloPro has successfully been applied
to explore the evolutionary landscape of the chromatin modiﬁcation
machinery (On et al., 2010), and the conservation of substrates of the
Nedd4 family of ubiquitin ligases (Persaud et al., 2009). There are
several caveats associated with orthology detection (Ruano—Rubio
et al., 2009). For example, in the absence of detailed phylogenetic
analyses, domain gains, losses and shufﬂing events can signiﬁcantly
complicate orthology assignments. Hence, future development plans
for PhyloPro include incorporating alternative orthology predictions
from other graph or tree—based methods such as OrthoMCL (Li et al.,
2003) and TreeFam (Ruan et al., 2008). Furthermore, the list of target
species will be expanded as new genomes become available. Finally,
we plan to extend the range of query species beyond the six model
organisms to permit unbiased sequence—based searches. In summary,
PhyloPro provides an intuitive web—based resource for performing
rapid evolutionary and comparative studies of biological systems.

Abstract

Summary: Bio3D—web is an online application for analyzing the sequence, structure and conform—
ational heterogeneity of protein families. Major functionality is provided for identifying protein
structure sets for analysis, their alignment and refined structure superposition, sequence and
structure conservation analysis, mapping and clustering of conformations and the quantitative

comparison of their predicted structural dynamics.

Availability: Bio3D—web is based on the Bio3D and Shiny R packages. All major browsers are sup—
ported and full source code is available under a GPL2 license from http://thegrantlab.org/bi03d—

web.

1 Introduction

Many structures are now available for homologous proteins deter—
mined under different crystallization conditions and oligomerization
states. Detailed comparison of these structures can inform on struc—
tural dynamic mechanisms critical for protein function including
ligand binding, enzymatic catalysis, allosteric regulation and bi—
molecular recognition. A wide range of bioinformatics tools and
online servers enable researchers to explore and analyze individual
biomolecular structures. Notable examples include molecular visual—
ization, pairwise structural alignment and biophysics based tools
including various normal mode analysis servers (Eyal et 61]., 2015;
Suhre and Sanejouand, 2004; Tiwari et 61]., 2014). However, exist—
ing tools for detailed quantitative analysis of the sequence, structure
and dynamics of large heterogeneous protein families often require
significant computational expertise and typically remain accessible
only to expert users with relevant programming skills. For example,
the Bio3D package requires R (Grant et 61]., 2006), ProDy requires
python and Maven requires Matlab knowledge (Bakan et 61]., 2011;
Zimmermann et al., 2011). A recent contribution to making such
analysis more widely available online is the PDBFlex database

(Hrabe et 61]., 2016). PDBFlex catalogues the structural variation of
the same protein (PDB structures sharing 95% or more sequence
identity). However, more in—depth interactive analysis of user
defined structure sets across species and diverse protein families is
not currently available.

To this end we have developed Bio3D—web—a web application
that implements a complete workﬂow for user customized investiga—
tion of protein sequence—structure—dynamic relationships. Bio3D—web
provides unparalleled online functionality including inter-conformer
relationship mapping with principal component analysis (PCA),
and quantitative comparison of predicted internal dynamics across
protein families via new ensemble normal mode analysis (eNMA).
Together with conventional sequence and structure analysis
methods these approaches allow researchers to map the structural
dynamic properties of proteins for which PDB structures are
available.

Bio3D-web requires no programming knowledge and thus de—
creases the entry barrier to performing advanced comparative se—
quence, structure and dynamics analysis. Bio3D—web is powered
by the previously described Bio3D R package for structural

bioinformatics (Grant et al., 2006; Skjaerven et al., 2014). In particu—
lar, Bio3D approaches for identification of related protein struc—
tures, multiple alignment, rigid-core identification, optimal
superposition, PCA and eNMA form the basis of the application
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Structure and sequence annotations are
derived from the RCSB PDB (Berman, 2000) and PFAM databases
(Finn et al., 2014). Bio3D—web employs Shiny’s reactive program—
ming and web application framework to provide its interactive on—
line interface (Shiny, http://shiny.rstudio.com).

2 Example application

Providing the PDB ID of a single Rho GTPase (1FTN) in the
SEARCH tab identifies 1059 sequence similar structures from which
the top 214 are automatically selected as the most related structures
for further analysis. Users can optionally (de)select additional struc—
tures for further analysis. In this example we proceed with these struc—
tures that span RhoA/B/C, Cdc42 and Rac1/2/3 PDB entries. In the
ALIGN tab the selected structures are subject to multiple alignment,
similarity and conservation analysis. Characterization of superim—
posed structures is available from the FIT tab. This includes rigid core
identification, conservation analysis and RMSD based clustering.

The PCA tab more clearly displays the relationship between all
structures in terms of the principal displacements of their major vari-
able regions (Fig. 1A). In particular, the interactive low—dimensional
‘conformer plot’, displaying structures projected onto user defined
PCs, can be colored by sequence, RMSD and PCA based clustering
results (Fig. 1B). This plot can also be clicked on to identify individ—
ual structures along with their annotations such as ligand bound
species. For available Rho related structures three major conform—
ational clusters are clearly apparent (black, green and red in Fig.
1B). Inspection of these structures in the linked annotation table
reveals that the vast majority of cluster members correspond to

GDP—bound, GTP—analogue bound and nucleotide free structures
respectively. The residue—wise contributions to each PC are also
displayed interactively highlighting a number of potentially key
structural regions (Fig. 1C).

eNMA in the next tab indicates that these same regions display
significantly distinct dynamics upon nucleotide exchange (Fig. 1D).
Critically, the NMA here is performed on all selected structures in a
way that facilitates the interpretation of their structural similarity
and dissimilarity trends (Yao et al., 2016). This allows a user to ex—
plore dynamic trends in all crystalized states in relation to each other
without the conventional caveat of potentially over—interpreting the
differences between extreme cases or a single artifactual structure.
Collectively these results indicate the existence of three major Rho
superfamily conformational states that differ by a collective dis—
placement of two nucleotide—binding site regions, which in turn dis-
play significantly distinct ﬂexibilities upon nucleotide binding. In
the case of Rho GTPases these regions are known to be key for nu—
cleotide dependent modulation of protein—protein interactions
(Wittinghofer and Vetter, 2011). Further example application of
Bio3D—web to a range of distinct protein families is presented as

interactive demos online (http://thegrantlab.org/bio3d—web).

3 Conclusion

Bio3D-web is an online application for analyzing user defined het—
erogeneous biomolecular structure data. The design of Bio3D—web
emphasizes simplicity over exhaustive inclusion of the many analysis
methods available in the full Bio3D package. This effectively reduces
the required technical expertise and thus facilitates advanced struc—
tural bioinformatics analysis for a broader range of researchers. In
many cases it is envisaged that researchers will use Bio3D—web to
understand general trends in their protein family of interest, which
may then inform more specialized analyses. Bio3D—web is therefore
designed to quickly explore biomolecular structure datasets and to
act as a hypothesis—generating tool with sharable summary reports
that capture all users defined analysis choices and optionally enable
collaborators to visit previous analysis sessions.

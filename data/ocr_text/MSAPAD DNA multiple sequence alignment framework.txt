Abstract

Summary: Here we present the MSA-PAD application, a DNA multiple sequence alignment frame-
work that uses PFAM protein domain information to align DNA sequences encoding either single
or multiple protein domains. MSA-PAD has two alignment options: gene and genome mode.

Availability and Implementation: MSA-PAD is available as a web application (https://recasgate
way.ba.infn.itl) and as two Taverna workflows corresponding to two alignment modes (Gene
mode: http://www.myexperiment.org/workflows/4549.html; Genome Mode: http://www.myexperi

ment.org/workflows/4551.html).

1 Introduction

Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) is one of the oldest problems in
bioinformatics and represents a key step in sequence analysis appli-
cations such as phylogenetic inference and comparative genomics.
Algorithms such as translatorX (Abascal et al., 2010) and tranalz'gn
(EMBOSS; Rice et al., 2000), taking advantage of the higher conser-
vation of proteins than their respective coding sequences, use the
protein alignment to guide the reconstruction of accurate MSAs at
nucleotide level. However, these methods do not make use of infor-
mation embedded in protein domains. Moreover, when applied to
genomic sequences, such approaches account neither for intron oc-
currence nor for gene order variations (e.g. mitochondrial genomes;
D’Onorio de Meo et al., 2012) resulting in apparently truncated
protein domains or variations in their arrangement along the gen-
ome regions under investigation.

Here we present a DNA MSA framework (MSA-PAD), which
conceptually translates DNA sequences into amino acids (based on
user-defined genetic code and reading frame/s), uses information

from conserved PFAM domains (Finn et al., 2014) to assign the
translated sequences to known protein domains, accounts for
frameshifts when domain regions are split by introns, performs a
domain-based protein alignment and then uses protein alignment
information to generate the relevant nucleotide multiple alignment.
The final MSA can be generated following two different strategies:
(i) Gene and (ii) Genome mode. Gene mode alignment respects
domain order organization from 5’ to 3’, and resolves the alignment
of repetitive domains even when they are repeated in tandem.
Genome mode alignment provides a super-gene-like alignment
ignoring domain order constraints.

WebDav endpoint. In this way, it is possible to use a Uniform
Resource Identifier (URI) during the execution of the application.
MSA-PAD takes as input a multiple DNA sequence data set (FASTA
format) containing one (gene mode) or several genes (genome mode)
coding for single or multiple protein domains and potentially includ-
ing non-coding intervening regions. The Web service includes wrap-
pers for HMMer3.0 (Eddy, 2011) and a series of python scripts to
compute the analysis (Fig. 1). In detail, MSA-PAD first translates
DNA sequences following a user-defined genetic code and one or
more reading frame/s. All peptide fragments generated by the user-
defined frame translation (i.e. all reading frames split by stop
codons) are used as probes to search a local mirror of the PFAM-A
conserved domain database using hmmsearch and then detected pro-
tein domain blocks are aligned using the hmmalign algorithms of
HMMer3.0 (Eddy, 2011). Where frameshifts or a non-coding inter-
vening sequences are present, the domain alignments are merged by
a custom parser script that concatenates alignment chunks detected
in multiple frames. In this way, multigenic nucleotide sequences (i.e.
complete mitochondrial genomes) can be also submitted given that
the correct reading frame for each coding region is automatically
detected by domain assignment step. Later on, protein domain align-
ments are used to guide the relevant alignments at nucleotide level, a
process we denote in the following as back-alignment. The back-
alignments are finally merged according to the experimental mode
specified. In Gene Mode, the most frequent domain organization
pattern from 5’ to 3’ is detected and all sequences that are compat-
ible with this domain order, are aligned, while others are eliminated.
In this way, the back-aligned domains are merged according to the
order of current domain organization. In Genome Mode, only
unique protein domains are considered (avoiding domain paralogy
conﬂict across repetitive domains) and the back-aligned domains are

concatenated in arbitrary order. Together with the final MSA, the
position of each domain in the alignment is given in a separate file.
Additional outputs corresponding to the protein and the back-
aligned blocks are also provided (complete information regarding
the output data are provided in supplementary materials).

3 Results

We evaluated the ability of MSA-PAD to assign sequence fragments
to the correct domain block. The alignment within blocks was not
assessed given that it is entirely determined by the hmmalign algo-
rithm (Eddy, 2011). The case studies consisted of mitochondrial
genomes exhibiting either conserved or varied gene order, genes con-
taining introns, sequences encoding repeated domains, genes demon-
strating intron loss/gain and ORFs encoding single protein domains.
We evaluated MSA-PAD for protein sequence identity compared
with the reference, protein sequence assignment to the correct
PFAM domain, the order of domain blocks merged—with particular
reference to repeated domains (in Gene Mode) and the uniqueness
of these domains (in Genome Mode). Our results show that MSA-
PAD correctly translated DNA sequences, assigned them to the right
PFAM domains (no false positive assignments) and assembled them
as expected in both Gene and Genome modes (Supplementary Table
S1). The unique feature of MSA-PAD compared to other methods
(e.g. TranslatorX, tranalign) is that it is able to automatically gener-
ate an accurate MSA even where frameshifts or introns are present
in the input sequences. Furthermore, it is able to generate a super-
gene-like alignment when input sequences contain multiple genes
(e.g. complete mitochondrial genome sequences).

However, MSA-PAD may have some limitations when no PFAM
domain match is found for the input sequences or when a matched
domain fragment is too short (e.g. in the case of a short exon) to
produce a significant alignment score.

4 Conclusions

We have created a new DNA MSA framework, MSA-PAD, which
uses PFAM-A profiles to generate DNA multiple alignments from
sequences encoding either single or multiple (including repeated)
protein domain/s. MSA-PAD will be useful for comparative gen-
omics applications as it can account for genomic rearrangements
and provide a ‘super-gene’ final alignment. In Gene Mode either
complete homologous gene loci (including introns) and mRNAs
(including UTRs) can be used as input as MSA-PAD automatically
reconstructs the domain-based alignment. We are currently prepar-
ing new options allowing user defined HMM profile/s to replace or
to be added to PFAM-A database. This will increase performance in
terms of quality and/or speed.

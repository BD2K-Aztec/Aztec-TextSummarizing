ABSTRACT

Motivation: The analysis of molecular coevolution provides informa-
tion on the potential functional and structural implication of positions
along DNA sequences, and several methods are available to identify
coevolving positions using probabilistic or combinatorial approaches.
The specific nucleotide or amino acid profile associated with the coe-
volution process is, however, not estimated, but only known profiles,
such as the Watson—Crick constraint, are usually considered a priori in
current measures of coevolution.

Results: Here, we propose a new probabilistic model, Coev, to
identify coevolving positions and their associated profile in DNA se-
quences while incorporating the underlying phylogenetic relationships.
The process of coevolution is modeled by a 16 x 16 instantaneous
rate matrix that includes rates of transition as well as a profile of
coevolution. We used simulated, empirical and illustrative data to
evaluate our model and to compare it with a model of ‘independent’
evolution using Akaike Information Criterion. We showed that the Coev
model is able to discriminate between coevolving and non-coevolving
positions and provides better specificity and speciﬁcity than other
available approaches. We further demonstrate that the identification
of the profile of coevolution can shed new light on the process of
dependent substitution during lineage evolution.

1 INTRODUCTION

Coevolution is deﬁned as ‘the modiﬁcation of a biological object
triggered by the change of a related object’ Hip et al., 2008). This
process of dependent evolution has been described in various
biological systems and can be an essential process behind
changes occurring at both morphological level, e. g. coevolution
of female and male genital morphology (Fitzpatrick et al., 2012),
and molecular level (Gobel et al., 2004), e.g. ligand—receptor
interactions (Chockalingam et al., 2005).

At the molecular level, studies of dependent substitutions have
gained importance in evolutionary biology because of the poten-
tial functional and structural interpretations that can be made on
the positions identiﬁed as coevolving. For example, coevolving
positions in proteins are known to be involved in allosteric

communication, to create physically connected networks that
link distant functional positions in the tertiary structure, and to
modify the structure of the protein (Baussand and Carbone,
2009; Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999). Further, it has been
shown recently that coevolving fragments within protein se-
quences can also be involved in binding speciﬁcity and folding
constraints (Dib and Carbone, 2012). They are thus good indi-
cators to explain folding intermediates, peptide assembly and key
mutations with known roles in genetic diseases (Dib and
Carbone, 2012). Coevolution within RNA sequences also
revealed structurally and functionally important positions
(Dutheil et al., 2010), which are often located on helices and
are subject to Watson—Crick constraint (i.e. guanine—cytosine
and adenine—thymine complementarity). For example, the
positions 245 and 283 of the 16S ribosomal RNA in T hermus
thermophilus coevolved under the speciﬁc Watson—Crick proﬁle
{CC, UU}, respectively, to maintain the speciﬁc hydrogen bonds
necessary for the stability of the helix hairpin-like structure
(Cannone et al., 2002).

Current methods designed to detect coevolution focus primar-
ily on the identiﬁcation of pair of positions along the aligned
sequence by evaluating a score of coevolution. Some methods
consider solely the set of aligned sequences to estimate these
coevolving positions (Carbone and Dib, 2011; Codoﬁer and
Fares, 2008; Fares and Travers, 2006; Gloor et al., 2005;
Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999; Yip et al., 2008), while
others take into account the evolutionary history of the observed
sequences (Baussand and Carbone, 2009; Corbi et al., 2012; Dib
and Carbone, 2012; Dutheil et al., 2005; Yeang et al., 2007).

The score of coevolution usually represents the correlation of
the nucleotide or amino acid patterns found at two different
positions along a multiple alignment. This correlation can be
considered as the outcome of the dependent evolutionary process
that is depicted by coevolution and the correlated pairs constitute
the set of coevolving nucleotides or amino acids. This set is
deﬁned here as the proﬁle of coevolution and is similar to the
proﬁle of site classes present in phylogenetic mixture models
(e.g. Lartillot and Philippe, 2004). While current methods de-
signed to detect coevolving positions have proven very useful,
they do not estimate the coevolving proﬁle that corresponds to
the structural or functional constraints involved in the evolution-
ary process (Dutheil et al., 2010). This lack of a mechanistic
component induces the use of arbitrary rules to identify the pro-
ﬁle of coevolution for protein-coding sequences, such as using
the most frequent pattern within a pair of coevolving positions
(Lockless and Ranganathan, 1999). Alternatively, the proﬁle of

coevolution can be set a priori, like in the case of RNA sequences
where Watson—Crick proﬁles are known to be important. Setting
a proﬁle a priori was done in a Bayesian context (Dutheil and
Galtier, 2007) by constraining the mapping of substitutions that
occurred independently at each site on the branches of the phylo-
genetic tree using, as weights, the biochemical properties of the
nucleotides deﬁning the Watson—Crick constraint. Similarly, this
constraint was used as modiﬁers of the rate parameters of a
dependent model describing the process of coevolution Weang
et al., 2007). State transitions that establish or maintain Watson—
Crick base pairs were favored and coevolution under this speciﬁc
constraint was assessed through likelihood ratio tests. These two
approaches conﬁrmed that a well-known coevolving pair was
constrained by a Watson—Crick proﬁle in 16S RNA sequences
(Dutheil et al., 2005; Yeang et al., 2007). However, other known
types of constraints, such as the Hoogsteen base pairing
WVesthof and Fritsch, 2000), were not explicitly incorporated
in the model and thus not identiﬁed in these analyses.
Furthermore, the integration of particular constraints in the
models may be difﬁcult in the case of amino acid or protein-
coding DNA sequences, for which little a priori information is
available regarding the coevolving proﬁles. Thus, the coevolving
proﬁle should be considered as a parameter to be estimated from
the data, rather than being deﬁned on the basis of the frequencies
of coevolving patterns or of known constraints.

Methods that estimate coevolving proﬁles in DNA, RNA or
protein sequences are currently not available. However, some
methods have been developed for binary encoded data where
coevolving proﬁles represent presence or absence of characters
such as genes, restriction sites, introns, indels and methylation
sites (Cohen et al., 2013; Franceschini et al., 2013). Identifying
the proﬁles of binary character states involved in correlated evo-
lution is also an important part of the analyses of phenotypic
data. These approaches have progressed from using maximum
parsimony criteria (Boussau et al., 2004; Mirkin et al., 2003) to a
full probabilistic framework (Csuros, 2005; Hao and Golding,
2006; Pagel, 1994) in which the dynamics of presence and ab-
sence of events are assumed to follow a continuous-time Markov
process along the phylogenetic tree. In this context, it is possible
to deﬁne a dependent substitution model, which is expressed as a
4 x 4 matrix of instantaneous transition rates, to explain the
correlated evolution of two binary characters (Pagel, 1994).
Each row and column of this matrix speciﬁes a pair of character
states built on an alphabet of size 2 (i.e. the character states of
binary traits), which deﬁnes two possible proﬁles of coevolution
{00, 11} or {01, 10}. This model can be compared to an inde-
pendent model of evolution, which assumes a single 2 x 2 sub-
stitution matrix, through likelihood ratio tests (Pagel, 1994).

It is possible to apply the ideas used for binary data to identify
proﬁles in molecular data. The nucleic (or proteic) alphabet can
be reduced to an alphabet of size two using the physico-chemical
properties behind the nucleotides or amino acids (Pollock et al.,
1999). This reduction is, however, arbitrary and could omit im-
portant factors that play a role in the evolution of the molecular
sequences. For this reason, we propose in this study a new
Markov model that describes the evolutionary process of coevol-
ving positions along DNA sequences. Because correlated pos-
itions within nucleotide and protein sequences are the result of
an evolutionary process, a better understanding of the coevolving

proﬁle should be obtained by incorporating the underlying
evolutionary history of the sequences (i.e. their phylogenetic
relationships and the associated proﬁle; Dutheil et al., 2010).
We thus developed a dependent model of nucleotide substitu-
tions based on a 16 x 16 instantaneous rate matrix that includes
four substitution rates 5, d, r1, r2 and a ﬁfth parameter «1) repre-
senting the proﬁle of coevolution. We implemented the model in
maximum likelihood and Bayesian frameworks. The perform-
ance of the model was tested simulated datasets and we com-
pared the model’s predictions with existing methodologies on
empirical data.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Deﬁnitions and notations

Let us consider the set S of aligned orthologous DNA sequences and a
phylogenetic tree ‘L’. We deﬁne a combination C as the association of two
letters [1 (C), [2 (C) from the same aligned sequence seq 6 S, where [1 (C) is
the letter at the ﬁrst position in seq and [2(6) is the letter at the second
position in seq. The maximal number of possible combinations depends
on the size of the alphabet and is equal to 16 in the case of nucleotide
sequences. For a pair of positions, the two combinations Cl and C2 are
called ‘conﬂicting combinations’ if either [1(61) is equal to [1(C2) or [2(61)
is equal to 12(62), that is, if two words share a common letter at any one
of the two positions.

For a pair of positions, every combination C,- has a number of occur-
rences 0(C,-) within the associated alignment S and a combination fre-
quency f(C,-), which is 0(C,-) divided by the total number of aligned
sequences. In the pair P1 (Fig. 1), for example, combinations AC and
TT occur at the same frequencies, whereas in pair P2, the number of oc-
currences 0(TT) is higher than the other and, thus, f(TT) > f(AC) (Table 1).

We deﬁne as Comb the set of combinations observed in a pair of sites,
which represents a subset of the 16 possible combinations. For example,
pair P3 (Fig. 1) has Comb 2 {AC, TT, AT}.

The ‘proportion of conﬂicts’ expresses the proportion of conﬂictual
combinations at two positions p1 and 122 as

A coevolving proﬁle ([5 e 73, is a subset of Comb that does not include
any pairs of conﬂicting combinations. In the case of nucleotide sequences,
the size of a proﬁle varies from 2 to 4 and the total number of proﬁles is
192 (IPI = 192; Supplementary Figure S1; Supplementary Material 1).
The frequency of a proﬁle is further calculated as the sum of the

combination frequencies composing it. For instance, in the pair P3
(Fig. 1), the proﬁle {AC, TT} is of size 2 and has a frequency of 0.8.

2.2 Model of coevolving substitutions

A dependent model of evolution for binary characters can be derived
from the standard models of substitutions by extending the dimension-
ality of the instantaneous rate matrix Q and evaluating the likelihood of a
pair of positions simultaneously (Pagel, 1994). Using a similar approach,
a dependent model for DNA sequences will be based on a Q matrix of
size 16 x 16 to account for the four states (A = {A, C, G, T}) representing
the nucleotide alphabet. For amino acid sequences, the instantaneous rate
matrix would be of size 400 x 400. Coevolution further posits that a
substitution should trigger the change at another position during a coe-
volution event and that these two events should not happen simultan-
eously. Consequently, all double substitutions have a rate of 0 (Pagel,
1994). The Q matrix of a generalized model of dependent evolution for
DNA sequences will thus be composed of 96 non-zero different instant-
aneous rates (Equation (2)), which will clearly lead to overparameteriza—
tion of the model. We propose a new way to restrict the number of
parameters by incorporating into the dependent model the discrete par-
ameter ([5 representing the coevolving proﬁle. This will reduce the number
of parameters to estimate from 96 to 4. There are at most 192 distinct
proﬁles ([5 that can be formed by combining two nucleotide positions. For
each of these proﬁles, a unique 16 x 16 Q matrix is constructed by dis-
tributing differently the four parameters depending on the combination
involved in each proﬁle (Supplementary Figure S4 and Table S1;
Supplementary Material 1). Given a proﬁle, ([5, the instantaneous rate
matrix Q of our model, Coev, is modeled as follows:

0 if i and j differ by two nucleotide positions,
r1 if {i, j} ¢ ([5 and if i differs from j at position 1,
Qij = r2 if {1, j} ¢ <15 and if i differs from j at position 2, (2)
s ifie¢andj¢¢,
d if 1' ¢ <15 and j E ([5

The parameter s is the rate of transition from a coevolving combination
present in the proﬁle to a non-coevolving combination. Conversely, d is
the rate of transition from one non-coevolving to a coevolving combin-
ation (Equation (2); Supplementary Figure S3A; Supplementary
Material 1). The additional parameters r1 and r2 are the rates of transi-
tions between two non-coevolving combinations at positions 1 and 2,
respectively (Supplementary Figure S3B; Supplementary Material 1).
For simplicity, we considered in the following a Jukes—Cantor (JC)
model of substitutions (J ukes and Cantor, 1969), where position 1 evolves
under a single rate r1 and position 2 evolves under another rate r2. This
can easily be modiﬁed to use any existing substitution models. The rate
parameters of the Coev model represent continuous variables potentially
taking any positive value (i.e. s, d, r1, r2 6 [0, 00]).

2.3 Maximum likelihood estimation

In a Maximum Likelihood (ML) framework, we want to estimate the
probability of a pair of positions X, which represents one combination of
characters for each species in S,

Prob(X|¢, s, d, r1, r2, ‘L’, 1)) (3)

coevolving under the model Coev along a phylogenetic tree with topology
‘L’ and branch lengths v. For simplicity, we assume that these ‘L’ and v
parameters are known and are not estimated during the ML optimiza-
tion. We use Felsenstein’s pruning algorithm (Felsenstein, 1981) to evalu-
ate the likelihood of the model. This is done by calculating, for
each branch of a phylogenetic tree, the transition probability matrix
P(t) = eQ’, where the branch length 1 is a ﬁnite time interval. The
amount of data in X is not sufﬁcient to estimate the frequencies at

those pairs is {AC, TT}. The proportion of conﬂicting combinations (Equation (1))
increases as Scomp score decreases. Notice that considering two positions p1 and p2 of
a pair, the score Scomp is not symmetric.

equilibrium and the model assumes that the frequencies of all combin-
ations are equal (Pagel, 1994).

The parameter ([5 is a discrete parameter and an exhaustive search
through the 192 possible proﬁles of 73 is performed to ﬁnd the proﬁle
that best ﬁt the data X. For each proﬁle ([5, the continuous parameters are
estimated by numerical integration to obtain the values that maximized
the probability of X (Equation (3)) using the Nelder—Mead algorithm
Welder and Mead, 1965).

The Coev model can be tested against an ‘independent’ model that
assumes that the two positions are evolving independently from
each other. The ﬁt of the Coev model with respect to the ‘independent’
model was estimated using A Akaike information criterion
(AAIC = AICindependent — AICCOCV). This procedure can be used to
assess whether a pair of positions X is coevolving by directly indicating
if the Coev model better ﬁts the data than the ‘independent’ one. For
example, the pairs 1, 2 and 3 in Figure 1 were coevolving with the proﬁle
{AC,TT} (Supplementary Table S7; Supplementary Material 1). In con-
trast, the Comb set of pair 4 was composed of two conﬂicting combin-
ations AC and AT and 73 = 0, which means that the positions forming
pair 4 are not coevolving. The examples illustrated by pairs 1, 2 and 3
(Fig. 1) also showed that the AAIC scores for Coev are providing similar
results than the non-parametric scores of coevolution (here Scomp;
Table 1; Dip and Carbone, 2012) and that the AAIC decreases
under weaker coevolution (Supplementary Table S7; Supplementary
Material 1). To delimit with conﬁdence the list of coevolving pairs for
a given dataset, a distribution of expected AAIC was obtained for each
dataset by simulating alignments based on the same phylogenetic tree as
the original data but evolving the nucleotides under the ‘independent’
model. The 95th percentile of this expected AAIC distribution provided
a threshold to consider the observed AAIC for Coev to be large enough
to be accepted as evidence for coevolution (see Supplementary Material 1
for more details).

2.4 Bayesian implementation

As is commonly done in other evolutionary models, we ﬁrst tested all
combination of pairs X in an alignment S for coevolution using the ML
implementation and then used the Bayesian approach to fully estimate
the uncertainty in the parameter estimates of the Coev model for pairs
that did coevolve based on the AAIC described above (e.g. FitzJohn,
2012). The Bayesian framework used a Markov Chain Monte Carlo
algorithm (MCMC) to sample the rate parameters (s, d, r1, r2) and esti-
mated the proﬁle ¢ from their posterior distribution. We updated the rate
parameters by applying a uniform sliding window on the log scale of the
parameters (Ronquist et al., 2009), while we randomly drew the proﬁle

based on a uniform prior distribution. It should be noted that while a
change of proﬁle forces a reassignment of potentially all rates within the
16 x 16 instantaneous rate matrix, the number of parameters, and thus
the dimension of the model, remains unchanged. We implemented a
Metropolis-coupled MCMC (MC3) algorithm (Altekar et al., 2004) to
move across the discrete parameter space deﬁned by the ﬁnite number
of proﬁles and to improve the mixing of the chains. Swaps between chains
were randomly proposed every ﬁfth generations, and posterior estimates
of the parameters were obtained from 1000 000 MC3 generations (after
the bumin phase), sampling parameters every 1000 generations. We as-
sessed the efﬁciency of the chain mixing by measuring the effective sample
size of the different parameters and by examining the MCMC log ﬁles in
Tracer (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007). The sampling frequencies of
each proﬁle were calculated from the MCMC samples and used as ap-
proximations for the respective posterior probabilities. The rate param-
eters were summarized as mean values and 95% credibility intervals,
calculated as highest posterior densities.

2.5 Empirical simulated and illustrative datasets

We analyzed (i) two datasets to compare model predictions on real bio-
logical sequences (empirical datasets), (ii) datasets of three different sizes
with each 180 simulated positions (simulated datasets) to evaluate the
models performance and (iii) two additional datasets to study the intrinsic
properties of Coev model (illustrative datasets).

The ﬁrst empirical dataset was a DNA alignment of the large subunit
of the ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene (rbcL). The dataset con-
tained 422 species of Poaceae obtained from GPWG2 (2012). We used a
larger but taxonomically more focused set of sequences than Wang et al.
(2011) who looked for co-evolving positions in 142 rbcL angiosperms,
gymnosperms, ferns and mosses sequences. The second dataset was
obtained from Yeang et al. (2007) and included 146 sequences of 16S
RNA spanning several kingdoms of life (animals, plants, fungi, archea
and bacteria). The 16S ribosomal RNA sequence is well known for its
coevolving pair 245, 283 constituted of 68 CC combinations and 65 UU
combinations across different lineages GDutheil et al., 2005; Yeang et al.,
2007).

For both empirical datasets, we ﬁltered the alignment to remove highly
conserved positions (i.e. >90% conservation) as well as all positions
with at least one insertion or deletion. We estimated the presence of
coevolution on all pairs of positions of the ﬁltered alignments of the
two empirical datasets using the ML implementation of Coev. The coe-
volving positions identiﬁed by ML were subsequently analyzed with the
Bayesian implementation to evaluate the posterior probabilities of
the coevolving proﬁles. For comparison, we also ran two non-parametric
methods (score of comparison, Scomp; Dib and Carbone, 2012) and
Mutual Information (MI; Gloor et al., 2005) and two parametric
models: CO (Y eang et al., 2007) and CoMap.

To further evaluate the performances of our new model, we simulated
three datasets of variable size (33, 67 and 110 species). Tree topologies
were randomly created and the branches of the phylogenetic trees were
randomly drawn form an exponential distribution with A = 0.5. The
coevolving positions were created by simulating convergent codons in
different lineages differing by a single nucleotide (e.g. Methionine ATG
to Lysine AAG) in the coevolving lineages following the approach used
by Christin et al. (2012). The second position of each codon was then
kept. This has the advantage to use a model of evolution (here codon
model of substitution) that is different from Coev, while creating a pat-
tern of nucleotides that mimics coevolution. It will thus not favor our
model over any alternative approaches to measure coevolution. For each
dataset, we simulated 20 coevolving positions and concatenated these
positions with 160 independently evolving positions that were simulated
without forcing coevolution. Each of these datasets resulted in the simu-
lation of 190 pairs of coevolving positions ((20*20 — 20)/2) and 15920
non-coevolving pairs and allowed us to evaluate each method using

standard performance measures. Speciﬁcally, we estimated the number
of positions correctly predicted as coevolving (true positives, TP), the
number of residues correctly predicted as non-coevolving (true negatives,
TN), the number of non-coevolving positions predicted as coevolving
(false positives, FF) and the number of coevolving residues predicted as
non-coevolving (false negatives, FN). From these measures, we calculated
the sensitivity TP/(TP+ FN), speciﬁcity TN/(TN+ FP), accuracy
(TP + TN) / (TP + FN + TN + FF) and positive predictive value TP/
(TP + FP) for each method tested. We compared the performance of
Coev to CoMap, Scomp and CO methods. Coev performance was evalu-
ated by considering pairs with AAIC values higher than the 95th per-
centile value of the AAIC distribution issued from independently
evolving positions. The performance of CoMap was evaluated by con-
sidering coevolving pairs with a stat score >0.75 and a P—value <0.05,
while the performance of Scomp was evaluated by considering pairs with
either a score equal to 1 (SComp I) or the 1% top scores (SComp II) as
coevolving. For the CO parametric model, we considered pairs with a
likelihood ratio >6 log units as coevolving Yeang et al. (2007).

In the Supplementary Material 1, we also described two illustrative
datasets (S1 and S2) speciﬁcally designed to highlight the intrinsic proper-
ties of the model. Those datasets were designed to explore the properties
of the Coev model and in particular to assess the effect of conﬂicting
combinations on the model.

The dataset S1 was composed of ﬁve pairs of positions. The ﬁrst pair,
P1(S1), had a Combplm) size equal to two (Combplm) 2 {AA, TT}).
The number of occurrences of each combination is reported in
Supplementary Table S3 (Supplementary Material 1). The four other
pairs were created by adding each time one new conﬂictual combination
to the previous pair. The dataset S2 was built with the same rationale but
starting with a pair of positions with a complex proﬁle of coevolution
(combpl(52) 2 {AA, CC, GG, TT}).

3 RESULTS
3.1 Ribulose-bisphosphate carboxylase gene

We ran our ML implementation on the 74 ﬁltered positions of
rbcL and found, out of the 2701 possible pairs tested, that Coev
was preferred over the ‘independent’ model for a total of 103
pairs of positions. The three coevolving nucleotide pairs (pos-
itions 401, 950 and 1058 in the alignment) that obtained the
best AAIC belong to codon 133 of the N-terminal domain,
and codons 326 and 362 of the C-terminal domain. These pos-
itions are not in close proximity in the DNA sequence. However,
they form a triplet that is in direct contact in the 3D crystallized
structure of Oryza sativa RuBisCO protein (pdb 1WDD;
Supplementary Figure S12; Supplementary Material 1). The
three amino acids are linked to the binding site of the CAP A
1001 substrate, suggesting their involvement in the allosteric
movements of the RuBisCO (Lockless and Ranganathan,
1999). The AAIC ranged from 6.65 to 171.53 log units. The
nucleotide pair 950—1058 had the highest AAIC value for
the coevolving proﬁle {AA, GG} (Supplementary Table S5;
Supplementary Material 1). The Bayesian analysis over this
pair of positions conﬁrmed that {AA, GG} is the proﬁle with
the highest posterior probability (100%).

The highest MI score obtained over the 2701 possible pairs of
the rbcL gene was 0.9 (Gloor et al., 2005). The M1 score could, in
theory, vary between 0 and 2 and scores below 0.9 indicates that
none of the pairs are coevolving (Supplementary Material 2).
High MI score are obtained when the frequencies of the non-
conﬂicting combinations are homogeneous, which is not the case

950—1058 was 363 out of 422, which lead to a MI score of 0.
Further, none of the 103 pairs had a Scomp score >0.86 and the
Scomp score associated with the pair 950—1058 was intermediate
(0.54 and 0.51). This is certainly due to the fact that the pair was
partially composed of conﬂicting combinations (Comb: {AA,
AG, GA, GG}). The pair 656—818 had the highest Scomp value
(0.86) and the AAIC of the Coev model was not the highest
(35.98). When we looked closely at the combinations associated
with this pair, we observed that the AC combination had the
highest frequency (70% or 297 species out of 422) and the com-
bination with the second highest frequency was TC (17%). The
two most frequent combinations were conﬂicting combinations
and could not be the proﬁle of coevolution. However, this pair of
positions had seven possible proﬁles:{TC, AA}; {TC, AT}; {AC,
TA}; {AA, CC}; {CC, TA}; {CC, AT}; {AT, TA}. Among those,
{TC, AA} had the highest AAIC score for the Coev model
(35.98) and {AT, TA} had a comparable AAIC score (34.71).
The two proﬁles had no common combination and the s or d
estimated values for each were similar (5 = 0.06, d = 1.66 for {TC,
AA} and $20.07, d: 1.62 for {AT, TA}).

The CoMap model predicted 164 pairs of co-evolving pos-
itions with a P—value <0.05. However, none of the predicted
pairs had a stat score that exceeded 0.75 (the 164 stat scores
vary from 0.10 to 0.56) and 12 out of the 164 co-evolving pairs
are also predicted by Coev. Wang et al. (2011) originally reported
that about half of the sites of the rbcL gene are co-evolving
whereas the new analysis (using the 422 sequences ﬁltered
dataset) showed that ~40% (30 out of 74) of the sites are co-
evolving when using CoMap. This difference is likely due to the
dependency of CoMap to the number of species (Fig. 2).

Finally, the CO model predicted 15 pairs of coevolving pos-
itions. The three coevolving pairs with the highest AAIC were
not identiﬁed by CO. However, the pairs 61—407 identiﬁed by
CO with the highest score (19 log units) was predicted by
Coev among the 103 list of pair of positions preferred over the
‘independent’ model. This pair was mainly composed of two
conﬂicting combinations CT and CG and its estimated proﬁle
was {CT, TA}.

3.2 16S ribosomal RNA

The 16S ribosomal RNA empirical dataset was ﬁrst used to
analyze the well-known coevolving pair of positions 245—283,
which have been found as coevolving under the Watson—Crick
proﬁle {CC,UU} by both structural and experimental analyses
(Cannone et al., 2002). ML analyses showed that the Coev model
for this pair had a AAIC = 53.71 (Supplementary Table S6;
Supplementary Material 1), which conﬁrmed that {CC,UU}
was the best proﬁle of coevolution for this pair.

Over all the 23 005 possible pairs that can be tested with the
16S ribosomal RNA dataset, we found, however, that the best
coevolving pair was not the positions 245—283, but rather the
positions 1950—2017 (AAIC of 164.72). Using the 95th percentile
of the expected AAIC distribution as the threshold of coevolu-
tion (AAIC = 1.77; see Supplementary Material 1), 1008 pairs
were selected as coevolving. Among those, the top 3% of the
pairs with the highest AAIC displayed proﬁles of different

complexity: 12 pairs had a proﬁle of size 2, 12 pairs had a proﬁle
of size 3, ﬁve pairs had a proﬁle of size 4. Among those 29 pairs,
25 showed a typical Watson—Crick proﬁle. However, the pair
with the highest AAIC had a complex Watson—Crick proﬁle
{AT, CG, GC, TA} with repeated occurrences of each combin-
ation across lineages of the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary
Table S7; Supplementary Material 1).

Several of the 29 pairs identiﬁed by Coev were also identiﬁed
by Scomp (pairs 1970—2011, 1950—2017, 4410—4420, 4429—4439,
1948—2020) or MI (pairs 1950—2017, 2065—3569, 1556—1592,
1951—2016, 3384—3407, 4411—4419). Nevertheless, no correlation
was observed between the AAIC values and Scomp or MI scores
(Pearson correlation=0.19 and 0.1, respectively). We looked
more closely at the pair 1948—2020, whose proportion of conﬂict
was 0 and Scomp score was maximal, but whose AAIC for Coev
was not the highest (52.05 log units). Its AAIC was not the
highest, it was still larger than the threshold of coevolution
deﬁned for this empirical dataset and its estimated proﬁle was
{CG, GC, TA}. The GC combination occurred in all bacterial,
archae and protist lineages, as well as the two eukaryote organ-
elles. In contrast, all multicellular eukaryotes had the TA
combination, except two fungi (Fellomyces ogasawarenisis
and Bullera huiaensis) and one animal (Strongylocentrotus
intermedius), which retained the ancestral CG combination
(Supplementary Figure S10; Supplementary Material 1). The
double substitution between TA and CG was thus speciﬁc
to the multicellular eukaryotic lineages and, although it is not
possible to date precisely the acquisition of the TA combination,
it suggests a local coevolution within the phylogenetic tree in the
early evolution of the multicellular eukaryotes. The Coev model
is thus sensitive to local coevolution patterns and, in contrast
to other methods, can distinguish between global and local coe-
volving positions.

We further validated our predictions by localizing the coevol-
ving positions on the 2D and 3D structure available for the 16S
subunit (pdb 2AVSO of Escherichia coli. We found that 24 of the
29 pairs identiﬁed by our model were connected in the 2D struc-
ture (Supplementary Figure S13 (left); Supplementary Material
1) and 26 of the 29 pairs were connected in the 3D structure
(Supplementary Figure S13 (right); Supplementary Material 1).
In contrast, only ﬁve and six of the 15 pairs of positions pre-
dicted by Scomp demonstrate direct contact of the nucleic acid
pairs in the 2D and 3D structure, respectively. For CO, Yeang
et al. (2007) reported that 15 of the 41 predicted pairs are in
direct contact in the 3D structure.

3.3 Simulated and illustrative datasets

The Coev model outperformed other parametric and non-
parametric methods for the three simulated datasets of size
110, 67 and 33 sequences (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S9;
Supplementary Material 1). In particular, the sensitivity was
found to be consistently higher in the simulations suggesting
that the Coev model can reliably detect true coevolving positions
(i.e. all of the 190 co-evolving pairs simulated for each of
datasets). The sensitivity of Coev did not appear to be affected
by the size of the tree whereas a substantial decrease was
observed in Scomp and CoMap (9- and 4-fold, respectively)
with increasing tree size (Fig. 2; Supplementary Table S9;

Fig. 2. Performance: sensitivity and speciﬁcity plots. Sensitivity and speciﬁcity plots comparing the performance of the Coev model to CoMap, Scomp
and CO. For each dataset (110, 67 and 33 tips), we simulated an alignment of 180 positions (20 coevolving positions and 160 independently evolving).
SComp I is the performance of Scomp method when only maximal scores of 1 are considered, whereas SComp II considered the 1% top scores. CoMap’s
performance where evaluated when considering coevolving pairs with a stat score >0.75 and a P—value <0.05. While the speciﬁcity does not strikingly
change across datasets and methods, the sensitivity is higher for the Coev when compared to the other methods

Supplementary Material 1). Noticeably, the CO model failed
to recover the true co-evolving positions in all datasets
(TP: 0). These observations were previously shown by Dib
and Carbone (2012).

Moreover, two illustrative datasets (S1 and S2) were used to
describe intrinsic properties of the Coev model (Supplementary
Material 1). The analysis of S1 and S2 showed a strong negative
correlation of —0.994 between the proportion of conﬂicts and the
AAIC values. Furthermore, the simulations revealed that the s/d
ratio can be seen as a measure of the coevolution strength
(Supplementary Figure S7; Supplementary Material 1) since s/d
ratio decreased as the signal of coevolution became stronger.
In the perfectly coevolving case, s/d tended towards zero
(Supplementary Table S8; Supplementary Material 1), whereas
this ratio increased until the two parameters became equal when
the pairs of positions evolved independently. Further, the r1, r2
parameters do not incorporate information about coevolution
since their values can ﬂuctuate from zero to inﬁnity without
any correlation with the AAIC of Coev (Supplementary
Table S8; Supplementary Material 1).

We also designed an experiment (Supplementary Material 1)
to show that, contrary to the Scomp score, Coev can distinguish
between coevolving and co-inherited pairs of positions
(Supplementary Figure S9; Supplementary Material 1). A co-
inherited pair is deﬁned as a combination acquired only
once during the evolution and further inherited by all the des-
cendants. Our results showed that the AAIC difference
increased with the number of occurrences of the combination in
the phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Figure S9; Supplementary
Material 1).

4 DISCUSSION

We presented a new dependent model of evolution, Coev, based
on the broad class of Markov models. Coev can reliably identify
the coevolving pairs of nucleotide positions and their molecular
footprint, expressed by the proﬁle of coevolution. The Coev
model incorporates free parameters that are easily interpreted
from an evolutionary perspective and that govern the change
of one combination into another within pairs of coevolving pos-
itions. Our model is mechanistic and describes the process of
evolution that is responsible for the simultaneous evolution of
dependent sites along DNA or amino acid sequences. The proﬁle
of coevolution is explicitly incorporated in the model as a discrete
parameter and thus can be estimated from the data. It is an
essential parameter in our model since it shapes the instantan-
eous rate matrix at the base of Coev (Supplementary Figure S4;
Supplementary Material 1) and deﬁnes the number of occur-
rences of the rate parameters 5, d, r1 and r2 (Supplementary
Table S1; Supplementary Material 1). The parameter s is the
rate of transition from a coevolving combination to a non-
coevolving one. This parameter thus represents the rate of a
necessary step (yielding conﬂict) that precedes the shift to a
new coevolving combination. A new substitution is then required
to re—establish the coevolving proﬁle, and this event is modeled
by the parameter d. This parameter d therefore represents the
rate of transition from a non-coevolving combination to a coe-
volving one. Parameters s and d describe the two temporally
successive substitutions that are the minimum requirement to
shift from one coevolving combination to another in the proﬁle.
The additional parameters r1 and r2 represent the rates of inde-
pendent substitution between non-coevolving combinations.

Evolutionary footprint of coevolving positions in genes

 

Conﬂictual substitutions in each site are modeled by a single
independent rate regardless of the type of substitution, e. g. tran-
sition/transversion, thus resembling a JC model. The model can
however be extended to incorporate more complex nucleotide
substitution models such as the GTR (Tavare, 1986).

4.1 Coev proﬁle and inﬂuence of the phylogenetic tree

Our approach can provide a better understanding of the evolu-
tionary forces shaping pairs of coevolving positions by estimat-
ing the proﬁle that best ﬁts the coevolving pair using a
probabilistic model of dependent nucleotide evolution. We im-
plemented our model in a Bayesian framework that further pro-
vides the posterior probability associated with each proﬁle for
a given pair of coevolving positions. The data-driven estimation
of the proﬁle of coevolution is novel and expands the potential of
coevolution analyses by allowing us to identify patterns of coe-
volution without restricting itself to known proﬁles, such as
Watson—Crick constraint for RNA sequences.

Based on illustrative and empirical datasets, we found that the
best ﬁtting proﬁle is not necessarily the most frequently observed
one, especially in the presence of conﬂicts (e. g. P5(S1) in
Supplementary Table S8; Supplementary Material 1). Further,
the selection of the proﬁle that best describes the coevolution at
two positions depends on the associated phylogenetic tree. Using
the Coev model, we showed that the coevolving proﬁles in ribo-
somal RNA are not necessarily Watson—Crick proﬁles but can
rather involve complex patterns with, for example, three or four
combinations. Additionally, the {CC, UU} proﬁle prediction for
the pair 245, 283 in the 16S ribosomal RNA sequence identiﬁed
by other methods (Dutheil et al., 2005; Yeang et al., 2007), was
estimated by Coev without assuming any a priori weighting
based on physico-chemical properties of the nucleotides. This is
certainly a strength of our approach as it allows the estimation of
coevolution due to other less known constraints or to extend
these analyses to protein coding genes that are not affected by
Watson—Crick constraint.

4.2 Coev model compared to other models

Some of the most widely used methods to estimate coevolution,
such as MI (Gloor et al., 2005), SCA (Lockless and
Ranganathan, 1999) and ELSC Hip et al., 2008), do not incorp-
orate the evolutionary history of the gene under consideration
and any random assignment of sequences along the underlying
tree produces the same score of coevolution. Other methods do
use the topology of the phylogenetic tree to estimate local scores
of coevolution for each node before merging them hierarchically
to obtain a single score for the whole tree (Dib and Carbone,
2012). We compared the performance of Coev to available meth-
ods and showed that it outperforms existing approaches espe-
cially when the number of sequences in the alignment increases
(Fig. 2). Moreover, available parametric and non-parametric
methods do not attempt to capture the long-term evolutionary
process shaping DNA sequences, but rather focus on the product
of this process only. This misses important information, such as
selective pressure and evolutionary constraints, which are key
elements to explain how and why a pair of positions can coe-
volve. Few attempts have been made to model coevolution dir-
ectly, but they all differ in several aspects from our Coev model.

First, the model used in the CoMap method was an attempt to
capture the process of coevolution in DNA sequences (Dutheil
and Galtier, 2007). It used a Bayesian approach to map the
substitutions that occurred at each site independently onto the
branches of the underlying phylogenetic tree. Mutations occur-
ring at two sites are thus not correlated, which violates the spe-
ciﬁc assumption of coevolution (Bollback, 2005; Huelsenbeck
et al., 2003). This could explain the lower sensitivity observed
in our simulations for CoMap and highlight the necessity to
model the precise process of coevolution to be able to correctly
predict correlated pairs of positions. Several studies used CoMap
to analyse the co-evolving positions within and among genes
(Corbi et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2011). For instance, Wang
et al. (2011) post-processed CoMap predictions to learn about
the combinations properties found in the co-evolving amino-acid
positions of the rbcL dataset. They looked for the most frequent
combination in the co-evolving positions and described the
bio-chemical properties of the amino acids composing the co-
evolving positions. However, we showed using Coev that the
most frequent combination is not necessarily part of the co-
evolutionary proﬁle and Coev is now able to estimate the proﬁle
of co-evolution along a phylogentic tree. This proﬁle provides
the biochemical properties and evolutionary constraint asso-
ciated with a pair of positions. Second, a Markov model that,
like Coev model, used an instantaneous rate matrix to model the
coevolution of pairs of positions has also been proposed Weang
et al., 2007, CO model). We compared the CO model with Coev
on the rbcL empirical data and showed that CO was not able to
capture the same coevolving pairs of positions and more specif-
ically the pair 950—1058 where AA and GG combinations appear
in several lineages along the tree. The CO model accounts for
non-independent evolution of the pair of positions by specifying
rate parameters for double substitutions and down-weighting the
single substitution rates. This has the effect of penalizing single
changes, but the model still allows simultaneous substitutions
within a small unit of time. The latter assumption is in contra-
diction with a coevolution process, where a substitution should
trigger the change at another position (Pagel, 1994). This contra-
diction could explain the lack of sensitivity of CO in our simu-
lations, which conﬁrmed previous studies (Dib and Carbone,
2012). Further, the different assumptions made by the CO and
Coev models, might explain the discrepancies in the prediction of
coevolving sites for the rbcL dataset.

Finally, the dependent model proposed by Pagel (1994) for
phenotypic data was modiﬁed and adapted for protein data
(Pollock et al., 1999), but this has not been extended to the full
alphabet of the sequences at hand. Instead, a categorization of
the physico-chemical properties of the amino acid was used to
create an alphabet of size 2 (e. g. positively and negatively
charged residues; large and small residues), and the dependent
model of Pagel (1994) was applied directly. The reduction of the
original amino acid alphabet into two categories has the advan-
tage of assessing potential important characteristics of the pro-
tein, but multiple categorization will be necessary to test which
physico-chemical property is the most pertinent for the coevolu-
tion. It is also possible that different lineages could present
coevolution between different physico-chemical properties for
the same pair of positions depending on the DNA-sequence ana-
lyses. In addition, the dismissal of the original alphabet will not

allow the characterization of the evolutionary process that has
lead to the binary coevolving pattern.

The Coev model is conceptually different from the approaches
that develop dependent models of evolution. Our model can de-
scribe the process of evolution of a coevolving pair, estimate the
associated proﬁle, reconstruct the ancestral states of dependent
positions and provide the probability vector for several ancestors
(see Supplementary Figure S8; Supplementary Material 1). We
have shown as well that the phylogenetic tree is an essential
aspect of the coevolution process and that the estimation of
the proﬁle, but also the prediction of coevolving positions, can
be affected by the underlying phylogenetic tree.

4.3 Global versus lineage speciﬁc coevolution

The Coev model assumes that a pair of positions coevolve under
the same evolutionary process along the whole phylogenetic tree.
It is however likely that during the acquisition of a new function,
a gene will be under different selective constraints in different
lineages. This will create branch-speciﬁc coevolving positions in
the phylogenetic tree that none of current methods are able to ac-
count for. For example, the evolution of genotypic convergence
has been documented recently (Castoe et al., 2009; Christin et al.,
2007) and it illustrates that different processes can take place in
speciﬁc lineages. For example, different codons are used in the
different lineages to create the convergent functional protein in
the C4 grasses. Thus, it will be important in future develop-
ment to deﬁne an evolutionary framework able to detect these
lineage-speciﬁc constraints, especially as gene-tree estimation can
be biased due to constraints or selective pressures (Christin et al.,
2012).

Additionally, the Coev model can help to distinguish coevol-
ving from co-inherited pairs of positions, which are deﬁned as
combinations acquired once in the evolution of a lineage and in-
herited by all its descendants. The pair of positions 1948—2020 of
the 16S ribosomal RNA family is an example of a co-inherited
position acquired at the origin of the multicellular organisms and
further lost only in few species. None of the available methods
consider the number of times a combination is acquired along
the tree when assessing a score of coevolution (Dutheil, 2012),
whereas in the Coev model we observed higher AAIC for pairs
whose combinations have been acquired multiple times in differ-
ent lineages. This is the case even though our model does not
explicitly count the number of acquisitions (Supplementary
Material 1). However, establishing whether the pair 1948—2020
is coevolving or co-inherited is still an open question. One difﬁ-
culty comes from the current deﬁnition for co-inheritance, which
is simplistic and assumes that a coevolving pair is necessarily
coevolving under a simple proﬁle (i.e. of size 2; Dutheil, 2012).
However, the pair 1948—2020 coevolved under a complex proﬁle
that presents both co-inherited and coevolving combinations.
The substitutions of GC to TA combination were co-inherited
by the ancestor of the multicellular organisms. However, the
CG combination was later acquired again several times and
can be considered as coevolution (Supplementary Figure S10;
Supplementary Material 1). This example clearly shows the dif-
ﬁculty to assess if two positions are coevolving or co-inherited
and the deﬁnition of co-inheritance given by Dutheil (2012)

should be revisited in order to take into account complex
proﬁles.

Lineage-speciﬁc constraint and co-inherited pairs affected our
model since their associated AAIC was weaker than coevolving
pairs with combinations acquired several times in the phylogen-
etic tree. One possible move forward to assess locally coevolving
pairs would be to extend the Coev model and allow the rate
parameters and coevolving proﬁles to vary across the branches
of a phylogenetic tree. There is also the need to better assess the
links existing between coevolution and the well-known selective
pressures affecting molecular sequences. This is an important
area to develop and it can help understand better protein signa-
tures that are used to identify the function and the role of newly
sequenced proteins. For instance, one could look for Hoogsteen
pair of positions that interact in the tertiary structures of RNA
sequences but that do not necessarily evolve simultaneously and
present conﬂict in the observed data.

5 CONCLUSION

We presented a new, fully mechanistic, model that describes the
processes governing the coevolution of a pair of positions.
Conserved sites have been extracted from gene families for more
than 40 years (Asthana et al., 2007), but we propose that the
evolutionary proﬁle of coevolving sites should be added to these
known signatures. This will help the community to classify highly
divergent sequences and better interpret the function of new ones.

Abstract

Motivation: Contact maps are a convenient method for the structural biologists to identify struc—
tural features through two—dimensional simplification. Binary (yes/no) contact maps with a single
cutoff distance can be generalized to show continuous distance ranges. We have developed a
UCSF Chimera tool, RRDistMaps, to compute such generalized maps in order to analyze pairwise
variations in intramolecular contacts. An interactive utility, RRDistMaps, visualizes conformational
changes, both local (e.g. binding—site residues) and global (e.g. hinge motion), between unbound
and bound proteins through distance patterns. Users can target residue pairs in RRDistMaps for
further navigation in Chimera. The interface contains the unique features of identifying long—range
residue motion and aligning sequences to simultaneously compare distance maps.

Availability and implementation: RRDistMaps was developed as part of UCSF Chimera release
1.10, which is freely available at http://rbvi.ucsf.edu/chimera/download.html, and operates on

 

Linux, Windows, and Mac OS.

1 Introduction

The rapid improvement of technology in recent decades has
enhanced our knowledge of protein structure, as visualization soft—
ware has revolutionized our understanding of molecular mechan-
isms. Recent applications such as CMView (Vehlow et 61]., 2011)
examine the nature of structural differences or changes in proteins
through the use of residue—residue (RR) contact maps (Holm and
Sander, 1993). RR contact maps are powerful two—dimensional
(2D) representations of protein 3D structure that plot patterns of
spatial interactions, e.g. pairs of amino acids with oc—carbons <8 
apart (Wu et 61]., 2008). 2D contact maps provide a complementary
view to 3D molecular visualization as they are unaffected by rota—
tion or translation and can be easily compared and superimposed.
Contact maps are typically shown as square plots with markers
denoting interactions between residues; residue pairs that fall out—
side of the interaction threshold are completely unmarked.
However, longer—range interactions may be used to identify larger—
scale motions such as hinge movements. Instead of using a single

cutoff threshold for contacts, displaying a color—coded distance map
can help users visualize longer—range interactions. As an extension to
the molecular visualization application UCSF Chimera (Pettersen
et 61]., 2004), we developed RRDistMaps, a tool to interactively
compute and display distance maps for individual proteins and to
compare the distance maps of pairs of similar proteins.

2 Description

RRDistMaps is invoked from the Tools/Structure Comparison
menu in UCSF Chimera and displays a list of the molecular chains
displayed in the 3D visualization window and an area for showing a
distance map. The user can select one or more chains and click the
Calculate Map button. If a single chain is selected, the RR distances
for that chain are computed and displayed as a grayscale distance
map along with a color—coding legend to its right. Moving the mouse
over the distance map displays the residue pair under the cursor in
the status line. Selecting residue pairs by clicking the mouse or

sweeping out a rectangle automatically highlights the corresponding
residues in the 3D visualization window. A green rectangle in the le-
gend marks the distances for which the color—coding is applied; resi—
due pairs whose RR distances fall outside of the rectangle are
displayed in dark gray. When only short distances are used for
color—coding, the distance maps are effectively contact maps.

For multi-protein comparison, RRDistMaps identifies corres—
ponding amino acids in the different chains using sequence align—
ment. This limits use of proteins with sequences similar enough to
be aligned correctly, and without topological rearrangements. In
general, however, distance map comparisons are only appropriate
for proteins with the same basic architecture. For two chains,
RRDistMaps uses the Needleman—Wunsch algorithm (Needleman
and Wunsch, 1970); for more than two chains, RRDistMaps uses
MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) via an online RBVI web service (Huang
et 61]., 2014). In both cases, the sequence alignment is displayed
using Chimera’s Multalign Viewer tool. Only positions in the se—
quence alignment where amino acids are present for all chains are
used. For corresponding amino acid pairs, the average oc—carbon dis—
tance and standard deviation are computed using values from all
chains. The user can choose to display only the average distance or
standard deviation, but the most useful display is the plot which
color—codes on both attributes, with residue pairs with high standard
deviation shown in color and low in grayscale. As with the single-
chain interface, the user can manipulate both the distance map and
the color—coding legend using the mouse.

3 Example usage

Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK) is a key enzyme in glycolysis. The
enzyme catalyzes the addition of a phosphate to ADP to make ATP.
During catalysis, PGK moves from an open to a closed conformation
via a hinge motion in order to bring ligands together and to shield
the reaction from water molecules. In this example (Fig. 1), we use
RRDistMaps on PGK in both closed and open forms to analyze the
change in protein conformation.

RRDistMaps aligns two PGK sequences using the
Needleman—Wunsch algorithm and displays the alignment in

Multalign Viewer. A distance map is computed for each conform—
ation using only residues for which the sequence alignment has iden—
tified a corresponding residue. These distance maps are shown in
Figure 1b and are visually similar. To help identify differences, the
two maps are combined to compute both the average distance and
standard deviation for corresponding residue pairs. These residue
pairs are color—coded such that pairs whose distances do not change
much between the two conformations are colored from white (close
together) to gray (far apart) while pairs whose distances vary greatly
between the two structures are colored from red (short average dis—
tance) to blue (long average distance). Thus, residues that stay fixed
relative to each other appear as grayscale while those that move are
colored.

Figure 1a shows three windows: the 3D view, the RRDistMaps
dialog and Multalign Viewer. The RRDistMaps dialog shows several
structural features in the color—coded combined distance map. The
white diagonal represents the zero distance from a residue to itself.
The slightly darkened white diagonals perpendicular to the main di—
agonal are antiparallel beta strands; white diagonals parallel to the
main diagonal are parallel beta strands. These can be seen in the sin—
gle—protein distance and contact maps as well. The red and blue
elements mark residue pairs that have the highest variations in dis—
tance in the two conformations. Sweeping out regions in the distance
map automatically highlights the selected residues in both the se—
quence alignment and the 3D graphical view. In the case of PGK,
examining the large, boldly colored regions reveals that these pairs
correspond to different segments of the protein undergoing hinge
motion. Our example was selected because the hinge motion can
easily be identified visually using distance maps, but in general more
complex algorithms may be required to identify subtle movements.

4 Significance and conclusion

Contact maps are frequently used for analyzing and comparing protein
structures. RRDistMaps couples contact maps with the 3D visualiza—
tion and modeling capabilities of UCSF Chimera. In addition, using
color—coded distance maps rather than contact maps enables users to
explore additional information using all pairwise inter—residue distances

ation (PDB:1VPE) and the open (PDB:3PGK) conformation. The sequence alignment between the proteins is shown in the Multalign Viewerwindow (bottom). The
average distance and standard deviation for all amino acid pairs are shown in the RRDistMaps dialog (top left); color coding using both distance and standard de-
viation data helps to highlight residue pairs of interest. Amino acids highlighted show hinge movement between the two conformations. In contrast, (b) shows
that the individual distance maps for both the closed form (top) and open form (bottom) are virtually indistinguishable visually when compared side-by-side

instead of just a subset. Automatic highlighting of amino acids in the
3D and sequence views for a distance map region also aids users in
integrating multiple information sources. The addition of RRDistMaps
extends the structure analysis and comparison capabilities in UCSF
Chimera. Planned improvements include allowing users to set align—
ment parameters such as gap penalties and offering Chimera’s
Matc/oMa/eer tool as an alternative alignment method that incorporates
secondary structure information.

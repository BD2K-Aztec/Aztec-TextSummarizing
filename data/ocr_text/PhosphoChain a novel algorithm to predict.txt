ABSTRACT

Motivation: Protein phosphorylation is critical for regulating cellular
activities by controlling protein activities, localization and turnover,
and by transmitting information within cells through signaling net-
works. However, predictions of protein phosphorylation and signaling
networks remain a significant challenge, lagging behind predictions of
transcriptional regulatory networks into which they often feed.
Results: We developed PhosphoChain to predict kinases, phosphat-
ases and chains of phosphorylation events in signaling networks
by combining mRNA expression levels of regulators and targets with
a motif detection algorithm and optional prior information.
PhosphoChain correctly reconstructed ~78% of the yeast mitogen-
activated protein kinase pathway from publicly available data. When
tested on yeast phosphoproteomic data from large-scale mass
spectrometry experiments, PhosphoChain correctly identified ~27%
more phosphorylation sites than existing motif detection tools
(NetPhosYeast and GPSZ.0), and predictions of kinase—phosphatase
interactions overlapped with ~59% of known interactions present
in yeast databases. PhosphoChain provides a valuable framework
for predicting condition-specific phosphorylation events from high-
throughput data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein post-translational modiﬁcations (PTMs) enable proteins
to rapidly switch from one state to another. Signaling networks
exploit this feature to transmit information from the cytoplasm
and outside the cell to the genome by interfacing with transcrip-
tion factors, which themselves form complex gene regulatory
networks. In comparison with gene regulatory networks,

our understanding and prediction of signaling networks is un-
developed, yet critical to a systems view of complex regulatory
dynamics.

Protein phosphorylation is by far the most commonly studied
and predominant post-translational modification of signaling
networks. Moreover, phosphorylation of signaling proteins is
fundamental to cellular responses, health and disease (Gotz
et al., 2010; van Berlo et al., 2011). Kinases and phosphatases,
which are responsible for adding and removing phosphates from
proteins, are common drug targets (Imming et al., 2006).

The vast majority of existing tools for predicting phosphoryl-
ation events tend to focus on predicting phosphorylation sites
from amino acid sequences (Ingrell et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008).
This approach is limited because kinases and phosphatases tend
to act on many of the same sites, and thus it is not clear which
factors are active under which conditions (Schwartz and
Madhani, 2004; Stark et al., 2010). Therefore, we sought to
include activity data to improve the predictability of phosphor-
ylation events and to reconstruct signaling networks.

Studies of signaling networks in both yeast (Prinz et al., 2004;
Roberts et al., 2000) and mammalian (Avignon et al., 1995;
Kusari et al., 1997) cells reveal that the expression of genes
encoding kinases often increases with the activation of the sig-
naling pathway, suggesting that expression might be a predictor
of signaling network activities. Similarly, high-throughput phos-
phoproteomics studies using biochemical enrichment and mass
spectrometry have led to large experimentally validated prote-
omic databases annotating phosphorylation on target proteins
(Khoury et al., 2011). These data map the potential changes of
protein activities and can be used to predict new phosphorylation
events and phosphorylation-driven regulatory networks.

Therefore, we developed a tool, called PhosphoChain, which
includes condition-speciﬁc regulatory information (i.e. kinase
and phosphatase activities or proxies thereof) to predict PTM
regulatory events and signaling network activities. In comparison
with 70 other phosphorylation prediction tools (Supplementary
Table S1), only RegPhos (Lee et al., 2011) and HeR Module
Wang et al., 2012) included activity data, and RegPhos only
used it to verify their predictions.

PhosphoChain works by constructing an alternating decision
tree (ADTree) containing nodes that predict whether a kinase or
phosphatase is active as well as the activities of target proteins
based on protein activity patterns and phosphorylation sequence

motifs that occur in multiple experiments. Here, we apply
PhosphoChain to the yeast MAPK (mitogen-activated protein
kinase) network as a test case and on a genome-wide scale to
predict the entire kinase-phosphatase—transcription factor regu-
latory network in yeast. The decision tree provides three bio-
logically relevant predictions: (i) given the measured activity
for a few factors, it predicts the activity levels for many targets;
(ii) it predicts the target sequence for factors (kinases or phos-
phatases); and (iii) it predicts the chain of post-translational
modiﬁcations (such as in the MAPK pathway) that are respon-
sible for downstream transcriptional changes.

2 METHODS

PhosphoChain builds a post-translational modiﬁcation regulatory net-
work by constructing an ADTree (Freund and Mason, 1999) for each
target protein in a genome or subset thereof. It is based on the Motif
Element Discrimination Using Sequence Agglomeration (MEDUSA)
algorithm (Bozdag et al., 2010; Kundaje et al., 2008), a tool that combines
mRNA expression with transcription factor binding motifs to predict
gene expression. MEDUSA is a highly accurate regulatory network de-
tection tool that identiﬁes regulation by simultaneously considering tran-
scription factor (TF) mRNA expression events, target gene mRNA
expression events and the existence of a TF binding motif on the target
genes. We developed PhosphoChain by modifying the core MEDUSA
concepts to detect post-translational modiﬁcation events. Speciﬁcally, we
simultaneously consider post-translational modiﬁcation factor activation
events, target protein activation events and the existence of a factor bind-
ing motif on the target protein. We augment this with an optional prior
association matrix based on gene deletion studies, a concept borrowed
from the HeR algorithm (Wang et al., 2012).

As shown in Figure 1, PhosphoChain combines the input protein ac-
tivity (PA) data with prior information to generate two sets of features: a
factor relevance matrix (FRM) and a motif matrix (MM). FRM is cal-
culated using the Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) between the ex-
perimental activity data and a prior activity matrix consisting of mutants
with the genes encoding the protein factors (e.g. kinases/phosphatases)
deleted (van Wageningen et al., 2010). In this way, prior information
from factor deletions is taken into consideration to favorably weight
known relationships among factors and targets. If a factor deletion
matrix is unavailable, then PhosphoChain will use the input PA matrix
directly instead of the FRM. The MM contains a set of candidate peptide
motifs calculated based on the similarity to known phosphorylation
motifs (Stark et al., 2010) as measured by an amino acid similarity
matrix, structural similarity matrix (SASM) (Goonesekere, 2009), which
is a structure-derived matrix used for detecting protein homologs. All
possible pairs consisting of FRM and MM features are combined to
create condition matrix (CM). Descriptions of variables are shown in
Supplementary Table S2.

To learn the PhosphoChain model, we try to predict the class (i.e. the
activity level: +1 or —1) of each target protein from the CM by generat-
ing an ADTree. The ADTree is composed of decision nodes and predic-
tion nodes. Decision nodes specify the predicate condition that (i) the
factor has a signiﬁcant correlation/anti-correlation in the FRM, and
(ii) the phosphorylated motif is present on the target protein sequence
in the MM. Prediction nodes contain a score associated with decision
node. The ﬁnal network is generated by traversing all nodes in the ﬁnal
ADTree. Once completed, the PhosphoChain model provides three con-
tributions: (i) a predicted class for a target protein, (ii) a predicted factor
binding site on the target protein and (iii) a predicted chain of phosphor-
ylation events.

Figure 1 and Supplementary Table S2 provide additional information
that is intended to make the PhosphoChain algorithm as clear as possible.

2.1 Datasets used to predict MAPK networks

We used two lists of factors considered as possible regulators when testing
out PhosphoChain: (i) the kinase/phosphatase (KP) dataset contained
144 factors deleted by (van Wageningen et al., 2010), and (ii) the
kinase/phosphatase/transcription factor (KPT) dataset contained 345 fac-
tors. This list contained 233 kinases/phosphatases and associated proteins
taken from yeast kinome (Breitkreutz et al., 2010; van Wageningen et al.,
2010) and 112 TFs from YEASTRACT (Abdulrehman et al., 2011).

2.2 Data processing

PhosphoChain takes as input a matrix of expressed PA for a set of pro-
teins P across a set of experiments E (e.g. mRNA expression experi-
ments). Each protein p e P is associated with a protein sequence s e S.
These input data are paired with prior information. The PA is paired with
a deletion activity (DA) matrix containing activity levels for proteins that
include P in experiments where factors f e F are perturbed. The protein
sequences S are scored against known phosphorylation motifs M.

2.2.] Identiﬁcation of FRM In this study, the PA matrix for
PhosphoChain is based on the mRNA expression. These datasets are
noisy, and the information relevant to PTMs may be masked by larger
signals. Therefore, it was desirable to weight the input matrix so that
known relationships among modiﬁers and targets are enhanced. As
shown in Figure 1, panel 1.1, the FRM makes this possible. Input data
are transformed into the FRM by calculating the PCC between a DA
matrix (van Wageningen et al., 2010) and the PA matrix:

cov(e, f)

1015,17 =Pcc(f€ F96 6 E) =
O‘eo‘f

where F contains protein factors for which genes are deleted in mutants,
and the E denotes experiments in which the activity proﬁles are measured.

CO? 1' E, F =
To include only signiﬁcantly correlated kinases/phosphatases in the
FRM, we quantized using a threshold of 0.3. Thus, the FRM becomes
trinary according to the following logic:

1 corrE, F > threshold
FRME,F = —l corrE,F< — l >l< threshold.
0 otherwise

2.2.2 Identiﬁcation of factor binding MM PhosphoChain generates
a set of new template binding motifs N from the set of known phosphor-
ylation motifs M [as reported by PhosphoGRID (Stark et al., 2010)]
and the set of protein sequences S. As N is calculated using a SASM-
based similarity score matrix on the known motifs, it may contain ‘new’
binding motifs, similar to protein binding sequences that have not
yet been observed. SASM is a structure-based substitution matrix for
detecting protein homologs that is expected to be more accurate for
our purposes than BLOSUM62 (Goonesekere, 2009). The similarity is
calculated as:

similarityme M, 1,6 F = arg maxsep(SASM(m, core 6 s) >l< ,8 +
SASM(m, side 6 s) >l< (l — ,B)),
where s is a k-mer (a k length peptide) generated from a protein sequence

using a sliding window. Our scheme more heavily weights those residues
closest to the center (i.e. modiﬁed) residue. By default, we use k: 13,

Fig. 1. Overall strategy to identify phosphorylation network for PhosphoChain. DATA PROCESSING: PhosphoChain constructs three matrices from
the input data to generate the model: an FRM, a binding MM and a CM. FRM is calculated using the PCC between the input PA proﬁle and factor DA
proﬁle. MM is generated from a list of template peptide motifs calculated based on the similarity to known phosphorylation motifs as measured by the
structure-derived amino acid substitution matrix, SASM. CM is generated by combining the FRM and MM. MODEL LEARNING: For each target
protein, an ADTree composed of decision nodes and prediction nodes is generated from the CM. Decision nodes specify the predicate condition that
(i) the kinase/phosphatase has a high correlation/anti-correlation with the experiment; and (ii) the phosphorylated motif is present on the protein
sequence. Each prediction node contains a score associated with a decision node. By traversing all satisﬁed nodes on the ADTree, target activity is
predicted. OUTPUT: The PhosphoChain model predicts (i) target activity; (ii) phosphorylation sites; and (iii) protein phosphorylation chains

where the core is within +/— 3 residues from the center, and the side is the
remaining six residues (Supplementary Fig. S1 for a visualization). The
parameter weights how important the current core fragment is relative
to the side. Here, ,8 is set to 0.9 as shown in Supplementary Figure S2.
To generate candidate motifs, the similarity score matrix is quantized
using the following criteria:

1 similarity M, p > threshold

MMRN = 1 top 10% ofsimilaritymeM,p,
0 otherwise

where threshold is set to 0.5 to make sure the model has good general-
ization. Similarly, the top 10% of similaritymeM, p provides an alternative
criteria to ensure that |N| is sufﬁciently large.

2.2.3 Identiﬁcation of CM PhosphoChain generates rules with the
following form: if factor f e F is correlated and motif n e N is present, then
f affects a target protein p. These rules create a binary CM containing all
pairs of correlations f and motifs n for all experiments E. The CM is
associated a class vector (protein activities rounded to +1, 0 or —1) as
shown in Figure 1, panel 13. The CM combined with the class vector
creates a canonical feature matrix with feature vector/class pairs {x,-, 32,},
where i = 1 : IE I and is the number of experiments in the input PA matrix.
Thus x, refers to a row in the CM, and )2, refers to the activity of p
in experiment i. Because CM is generally sparse and the PhosphoChain
algorithm does not consider experiments where y,=0, x,- and y,- are
calculated on the ﬂy directly from the FRM and MM as well as a pre-
trinarized PA matrix.

2.3 Model learning

PhosphoChain constructs an ADTree to predict the activity level for each
target protein p e P. The detailed pseudo-code for the PhosphoChain is
presented below and in Figure 1, panel II. In this study, we ran the
algorithm for T iterations, where T is approximately 2.5 times the
number of kinases/phosphatases in the set of factors F.

Initialization:

PhosphoChain extracts training data from the CM as inputs {x,-, 32,-},
where i: 1 : |E|. As previously stated, x,- is a condition vector drawn
from a row of the CM, and y,- is the activity level of the target protein
in those experiments where it signiﬁcantly changes (rounded to —1 or 1).
Experiments where the target PA does not signiﬁcantly change are
excluded from consideration, and the algorithm is initialized as follows:

WO 2 1/n, where w is matrix of weights.

a0 = 0.5 *ln(W+(TRUE)/W_(TRUE)), where a is set of prediction
values, Wi(c) is sum of the weights of all positively (+) and negatively
(—) labeled examples that satisfy condition c.

R0 = do, where R is a set of rules, R0 refers to root in the ADTree.
A rule r, e R consists of zero or more condition nodes and one or
more prediction nodes containing values such as do.

PC1 = {TRUE}, where PC is a set of preconditions associated with the
rules R.

W1 2 woe—“0*”, re-adjust weights.

C 2 conditions corresponding to the columns in the CM.
Execution:
For t = 1  T {

(1) Generate preconditions PC, from the current rules R,.

(2) For each precondition pc 6 PC, and each condition c e C, deter-
mine the c and p that minimize the boosting loss function:

Z,(pc, c) = 2 >l< \/W+(pc /\ c) >l< W_(pc /\ c) + Wi(-pc /\ -c).

 

(3) Given the pc and c that minimize Z, (pc, c), create the new
rule set: R,+1 = R, R r,, where r, is a rule with precondition pc,
condition c and prediction value a, such that

1 1 (W+(pc/\ c)+1)

(“22* n W_(pc/\c)+1

(4) Update weights such that
Wl+1 = w, >l< e_”(xt)*yt,

where r,(x,) is the predicted activity for the current protein based
on the new rule r, and the condition-speciﬁc truth values in x,.
} //End for loop.

Although each target protein may be correctly said to have its own
ADTree, this algorithm computes all such ADTrees simultaneously.
Thus, all ADTrees share a common head node, and ADTrees for proteins
that have a particular binding motif will share common nodes with
that motif.

Output:

PhosphoChain makes three predictions as outlined in Figure 1, panel 111:
(i) the predicted activity for each protein: 2;, r,(x,); (ii) the binding
sequences on that protein; and (iii) the regulatory network for that target
protein. To traverse the ADTree and reconstruct the network,
PhosphoChain uses PA values that may be part of the PA or may
come from new experimental data. PhosphoChain evaluates the activ-
ity-based preconditions speciﬁed in the decision node. If the tree for 1)
contains a satisﬁed decision node specifying factor f and motif n, then we
say that f binds to p at the residues in protein sequence s that most closely
matches n. Finally, we determine whether the binding of f activates or
deactivates p in a given experiment e by evaluating the activity levels of f
and p. If f is activated and p is activated, then f activates p. If f is activated
and p is deactivated, then f deactivates p. Similarly, if f is deactivated and
p is activated, then we say that f deactivates p. If f is deactivated and p is
deactivated, then we say that f activates p. Thus, the PhosphoChain
ADTree structure allows a factor to activate or deactivate the same
target depending on the available data. Once regulation is determined
for all proteins (e.g. A activates B, B deactivates C), then these can be
chained into a network (e.g. A activates B deactivates C).

2.3.] Scoring the models To score models using the undirected graph,
we counted all known relationships between factors as an edge, and scored
based on the percentage of edges correctly predicted by the model. To
score models using the directed graph, we counted it as a correct answer if
the model correctly identiﬁed an activating/deactivating relationship and
an incorrect answer if such a relationship was missed. For example, if X
was known to activate Y, it would count as wrong if a model found that X
interacts with or deactivates Y. If a relationship was known to exist, but no
direction (i.e. activation/deactivation) was known, then an activation, de-
activation or relationship with no direction predicted was counted as a
correct answer; the answer was counted as wrong only if the relationship
was missed entirely (see the scoring scheme in Supplementary Table S3).
The MAPK pathway presented here was taken from the Kyoto
Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) database and previous
studies (see Supplementary Table S4). P-values were calculated using a
binomial test.

To estimate an upper bound on the false discovery rate (FDR), we
assume that interactions between factors that do not appear in the litera-
ture do not exist. In speciﬁc, we treat each of the three MAPK sections
presented in Figure 2 as an independent entity. If a model predicts an
interaction between factors within these MAPK sections and no inter-
action exists in the literature, we count that as a false positive (e.g. if a
model predicts that Hogl activates Ptp3). As an alternative method, we
estimate the false positive rate (FPR) by repeatedly shufﬂing the training
data and then building a model of the MAPK pathway. Known

Kssl pathways and (C) the Ssk2—Hog1 pathway. A dashed green line means that PhosphoChain predicts a known undirected interaction to be activation
or deactivation. A solid green line with a purple arrowhead means that PhosphoChain predicts an interaction with no direction. These predicted
interactions are the same regardless of whether or not the GRA algorithm (Section 2.3.2) is run

relationships that match the model are counted as false positives; known
relationships that do not match are counted as true negatives.

2.3 .2 Greedy reduction algorithm PhosphoChain decision trees
simultaneously include predictions for all conditions represented in the
training set resulting in many predictions. To remove less likely KPT inter-
action predictions, we implemented a greedy reduction algorithm (GRA)
to reduce the number of predictions. If an ADTree can produce correct
predictions using only known protein—protein interactions (PPIs), then all
novel PPIs are excluded. However, if the novel interactions are necessary
for a good prediction, then they are left in. GRA runs as follows:
For 1) e P {
PS1, 2 Prediction node scores taken from the ADTree built for p.
Classp = The trinary class vector for protein p.
Sort PS1, so the smallest contributing factors are ﬁrst.
For f 6 factors in PS1, that are not known to interact with p {
Calculate PS’ omitting contribution from f ;
Break if (PS’ >l< Classp)<(|PS| >l< a) ;
Remove f from PS ;
} // End inner for loop.
Report all factors remaining in PS ;
} // End outer for loop.
where (|PS|*a) is a way to adjust the number of expected false positives
(FPs) and false negatives (FNs). In this study, we heavily penalized novel

interactions by setting 0:20. GRA has been implemented only for
PhosphoChain.

2.4 Reconstruction of the genome-wide kinome network

phates proteins. After removing ambiguous PPIs with the GRA, we

phosphorylation motifs to reconstruct chains of phosphorylation
events. PhosphoChain constructs an ADTree (Freund and
Mason, 1999) that describes which kinases and phosphatases
acting at speciﬁc binding sites affect the activity of a target pro-
tein. PhosphoChain generates rules based on PA measurements
and the presence of putative template kinase and phosphatase
binding motifs (e.g. Hogl is activated, and a Hogl binding
motif is present) that predicts the activity level of a target protein
(e. g. Ste12). PA levels are estimated from mRNA expression levels
in genome-wide expression studies involving genetic perturb-
ations. PhosphoChain works by iteratively adding good rules to
a master list of rules that, together, lead to a single strong
hypothesis.

PhosphoChain accepts as input a PA matrix that contains
activity measurements for a set of proteins P across a set of
experiments E (Fig. 1, panel I.1). For example, to reconstruct
the MAPK pathway, P is a dataset containing 336 genes encod-
ing KPT and E contains 28 mRNA expression experiments in
which MAPK-related factors have been deleted including some
experiments in which multiple genes were deleted (van
Wageningen et al., 2010). Each experiment is correlated with
DA measurements for the proteins when the factors F (i.e.
known kinases and phosphatases) are perturbed to produce an
FRM. For these experiments, the DA matrix includes 6097 pro-
teins and a dataset with perturbations of 144 kinases and phos-
phatases (KP). If a DA matrix is not available, then a subset of
the PA matrix containing activity levels for all factors F may be
used instead. However, including prior information through a
DA matrix is particularly important when using mRNA expres-
sion data because it is not the ideal proxy for post-translational
modiﬁcation-related activity.

Similarly, PhosphoChain accepts as input protein sequences P.
Figure 1, panel 12, shows how an SASM is used to generate
template (consensus) motifs N that encapsulate all known
target motifs M present on these sequences. A Boolean MM is
then generated that encodes which of the target proteins contain
one or more of the IN | motifs. PhosphoChain then generates a
separate tree for each of the target proteins. As shown in
Figure 1, panel 1.3, the algorithm generates conditions that com-
bine the FRM and MM to produce a CM that identiﬁes which
conditions are satisﬁed (e.g., factor 1 is active, and template
motif 3 is present). These conditions are evaluated for each of
the |E| experiments to produce the CM, which is paired with
a Class vector. The Class vector represents the activity level for
each target protein p during each experiment based on mRNA
levels. PhosphoChain then iteratively constructs an ADTree
by evaluating all |C| conditions (Fig. 1, panel 11.1) and
adding that rule that minimizes a weighted loss function. Thus,
PhosphoChain selects the best rule for predicting p’s activity level
across all experiments (Fig. 1, panel 112). The experiments are
then re—weighted so those misclassiﬁed by the previously added
rule contribute more toward the subsequent rule selected in the
next iteration (Fig. 1, panel II.3). After T iterations, the resulting
ADTree predicts the activity level of a single protein across
all conditions. Thus, each tree predicts the activity level for
one protein (Fig. 1, panel III.1) and the factors and motifs that
contribute to the ﬁnal activity level (Fig. 1, panel 111.2). This
procedure is repeated for all target proteins in P, and a complete
signaling network is reconstructed by chaining multiple trees

together (Fig. 1, panel III.3). This is accomplished by simply
ordering the predictions of each protein. The resulting network
includes all predictions, thus emphasizing completeness and re-
vealing potential complex network structure. Notably, during a
given experiment, only some of the conditions may be satisﬁed;
thus, PhosphoChain also predicts condition-speciﬁc regulation.

To test PhosphoChain’s performance and the relative import-
ance of its components, we compared PhosphoChain to
(i) PhosphoChain*, which is PhosphoChain without the DA
matrix; (ii) MEDUSA, which is the inspiration for
PhosphoChain and is designed to detect transcriptional regula-
tion; and (iii) ADTree, which is essentially PhosphoChain with-
out binding motifs. We tested these algorithms’ abilities to
reconstruct the phosphorylation-related portion of the four
well-studied yeast MAPK pathways shown in Figure 2
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) (Supplementary Table S4).
PhosphoChain was trained using mRNA expression data as
PA measurements for 28 gene deletion experiments (van
Wageningen et al., 2010), which included deletions of genes
that encode the 19 kinases and phosphatases present in the
MAPK pathway. We used 10-fold cross-validation to evaluate
the cutoff parameters for the FRM and MM and to compare
PhosphoChain with other tools. The results demonstrate that
PhosphoChain accurately predicts mRNA expression (Table 1)
and that accuracy was stable for nearly all cutoffs
(Supplementary Fig. S2).

3.1 Reconstruction of MAPK Pathways

We then used PhosphoChain to reconstruct known MAPK path-
ways from experimental data. This is particularly challenging
because (i) neither protein phosphorylation nor network struc-
ture data (apart from known binding motifs) were used as priors,
and (ii) some factors in the pathway are known as both activa-
tors and deactivators depending on the experimental conditions,
whereas other factors are known to interact, but it is not clear if
one activates or deactivates the other (Supplementary Table S4).

The MAPK network as reconstructed by PhosphoChain is
shown in Figure 2 (Supplementary Figs S3—S6 shows visualiza-
tions from other methods) and is scored in two different ways: (i) as
a directed graph, and (ii) as an undirected graph. Table 2 shows
that PhosphoChain reconstructed ~78% of the known directed
protein relationships in the MAPK pathways and ~91% if those
relationships are treated as undirected. We compared these results
with MEDUSA and HeR module (Bozdag et al., 2010; Wang

Note: PhosphoChain* is PhosphoChain trained directly using the PA matrix with-
out the DA matrix. PhosphoChain run with only the MM predicts no MAPK
interactions. PhosphoChain produces the same results regardless of whether or
not the GRA algorithm (Section 2.3.2) is run.

et al., 2012). MEDUSA is similar to PhosphoChain, but uses TF
DNA binding motifs instead of kinase/phosphatase protein bind-
ing motifs. MEDUSA recapitulated ~49% of the directed edges
and ~59% undirected. HeR module is a clustering algorithm that
uses an FRM. HeR’s undirected predictions recapitulated ~53%
of the undirected edges. Because no experimental data are yet
available to either substantiate or negate predictions not of the
literature, it is difﬁcult to determine whether these are false
positives. If we reverse the edges revealed in the literature
(Supplementary Table S4) to estimate the false positives and
true negatives, then PhosphoChain has an ~8% FPR and an
~12% FDR for directed graphs (~9% FPR and ~9% FDR for
undirected graphs), a better score than the those in other methods
(Supplementary Tables S3 and S5). This scoring method informs
the Table 2 control classiﬁer, providing a baseline accuracy of
~58% for the directed and 50% for the undirected graphs.

As the available literature probably does not exhaustively list
all interactions, assuming that the MAPK edges that do not
appear in the literature truly do not exist would probably under-
estimate the classiﬁer accuracy and be useful only for estimating
an upper bound on the FDR. Regardless, if we apply this
method, then we get the accuracies shown in Supplementary
Table S6 where PhosphoChain generally outperforms other
tested methods with a 45% FPR, a 57% FDR, a 64% accuracy
and a correlation of 0.37.

To estimate PhosphoChain’s likelihood to make false-positive
predictions another way, we shufﬂed the MAPK-related input data
to mask the MAPK signal and assumed that any predictions
matching known interactions are false positives. After applying
this method 20 times, we estimated the FPR to be ~3 % for directed
and ~10% for undirected graphs (Supplementary Fig. S7).

3.2 Predicting phosphorylation sites

We next tested PhosphoChain’s ability to predict phosphoryl-
ation sites on a large scale using the same parameter values as
in the MAPK experiments. As a reference, we used mass spectro-
metry mapped changes in yeast phosphorylation patterns after
perturbing 97 kinases and 27 phosphatases (Bodenmiller et al.,
2010). Although this dataset did not recapitulate many known
phosphorylation events (e.g. in an ste7 deletion, the phosphoryl-
ation status of few known Ste7 targets changed), it did provide a

good set of unique phosphorylation events. From this dataset,
we selected 472 unique phosphorylation sites related to kinase,
phosphatase and transcription factor proteins that had at least
six residues on each side of the phosphorylation site. We trained
PhosphoChain on 162 gene deletion microarray containing ex-
periments corresponding to the 144 kinases and phosphatases
(van Wageningen et al., 2010). PhosphoChain correctly identiﬁed
256 of the 472 unique phosphorylation sites present in the dataset
(Fig. 4A, binomial test, P—value 3.63e-02). Strikingly, 131 of the
256 sites are phosphorylated at new motifs that were not present
in the PhosphoGRID phosphorylation database (Stark et al.,
2010), but were experimentally determined by Bodenmiller
et al. (2010), thus demonstrating the power of PhosphoChain
for discovering sites de novo (Fig. 4A). We compared these results
with popular phosphorylation motif detection software packages
NetPhosYeast and GPS 2.0 (Ingrell et al., 2007; Xue et al., 2008),
which detected 204 and 199 of the 472 sites, respectively.
Figure 4B shows two de novo motifs predicted only by
PhosphoChain. Supplementary Table S7 shows motif patterns
detected by PhosphoChain.

3.3 Reconstruction of the genome-wide kinome network

We trained PhosphoChain on the 144 kinases and phosphatase
deletion experiments to construct the entire KPI network shown
in Supplementary Figure S8. Unfortunately, these are difﬁcult to
verify as databases of PPIs (Turinsky et al., 2010) and phosphor-
ylation events are notoriously incomplete, generally showing
poor overlap (Breitkreutz et al., 2010) even among computation-
ally inferred networks (Bansal et al., 2007). Nevertheless, we
compared the regulatory networks created by PhosphoChain
with those interactions recorded in the STRING (Szklarczyk
et al., 2011), BioGRID (Stark et al., 2011), KEGG (Kanehisa
and Goto, 2000), YeastKinome (Breitkreutz et al., 2010), MPact
(Guldener et al., 2006), MINT (Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2007)
and IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012) databases. We selected two types
of interaction networks: (i) a KPT interaction network with 345
factors; and (ii) a kinase and phosphatase (KP) interaction net-
work with 144 factors. These networks generated from
PhosphoChain had a 21—29% overlap with known interactions,
a better overlap than other methods tested (See Supplementary
Fig. S9).

Because there is no database of KPIs that do not occur, a large
number of (false positive) predictions would also yield high
coverage of the known network, but give the false impression
that PhosphoChain is performing well. To compensate for pos-
sible false-positive predictions, we implemented a greedy algo-
rithm to reduce the number of predictions that PhosphoChain
makes by using the following logic: If the ﬁnal PA can be
correctly predicted by the ADTree using only known PPIs,
then we removed all other interactions from the tree. However,
if the known PPIs could not account for the ﬁnal PA, then we left
the additional PPIs in the tree. By running this algorithm, we
reduced the number of predicted interactions from 11513 and
39 284 to 2823 and 1313 for the 345 factors and 144 factor net-
works, respectively. As shown in Figure 5, this increased coverage
to 41%/52% with BioGRID, 34%/41% with STRING, 16%/
19% with KEGG and 46%/59% overall when predicting the
networks containing 345/144 factors. Overall, PhosphoChain

Figure 3 shows 37 kinases and phosphatases [grouped
by function as deﬁned by (Breitkreutz et al., 2010)] predicted
as interacting in at least 15 conditions after the GRA. These
kinases and phosphatases are highly interconnected (hypergeo-
metic test, P: 1.77e—30 compared with randomly generated
networks) and thus may be key signaling hubs. This intercon-
nectivity is consistent with a previous result that has
>80% of the proteome interlinked by kinases (Breitkreutz
et al., 2010).

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

PhosphoChain predicts condition-speciﬁc phosphorylation-
mediated signaling networks from high-throughput data.
Speciﬁcally, it predicts the sequence of phosphorylation events,
the binding sites at which phosphorylation occurs and the
activity of target proteins. These predictions are based on PA
measurements as approximated by mRNA expression data
and consensus binding motifs generated from known phosphor-
ylation motifs. The number of predictions is reduced using a
greedy algorithm informed by known PPIs. Thus,
PhosphoChain’s predicted network includes some well-estab-
lished interactions and novel interactions that can be prioritized
for experimental validation.

In this study, we focused on mRNA expression levels as
proxies for PA. It is remarkable that mRNA can be used to
predict post-translational modiﬁcation status, but this is prob-
ably because signaling networks and gene regulatory networks
are highly coordinated—as kinases and phosphatases become
active, their gene expression levels often also increase (Avignon
et al., 1995; Kusari et al., 1997; Prinz et al., 2004; Roberts et al.,

Fig. 5. Analysis of interactions in PhosphoChain by overlap with inter-
actions in previously reported datasets. The GRA was used to remove
extraneous interactions. This resulted in 2823 and 1313 out of 39 384 and
10440 maximum non-redundant interactions predicted for the 345 KPT
and 144 KP datasets, respectively

2000). One possible mechanism is direct feedback. For example,
in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the TF Adrl is activated by the
kinase Snfl (Ratnakumar and Young, 2010). Adrl-binding
motifs exist in the promoter regions of both ADRI and SNFI.
(Abdulrehman et al., 2011; Chua et al., 2006). Thus, if a pathway
involving Adrl and Snf 1 is activated, the expression levels of
both may increase.

Regardless of the speciﬁc mechanism, the research conducted
here provides strong evidence that phosphorylation and mRNA
expression are linked. The ADTree presented in Tables 1 and 2
uses the FRM alone to produce an ADTree and thus is essen-
tially PhosphoChain without the MM. In Table 1, adding the
kinase/phophatase motifs to the ADTree (resulting in
PhosphoChain) increases the accuracy by >20% (P<10_77).
This demonstrates the effectiveness of these motifs for predicting
mRNA expression, implying a link between mRNA expression
phosphorylation. Table 2 uses the MAPK pathway to verify

interactions predicted by PhosphoChain. The P—value for
ADTree (PhosphoChain without motifs) is ~l.44e-05, implying
that mRNA data alone have information about phosphoryl-
ation. Taken together, we believe that this demonstrates that
mRNA expression levels are a reasonable proxy for PA in
PhosphoChain.

4.1 Extending PhosphoChain

PhosphoChain can run on other datasets by changing (i) the
binding motifs, M; (ii) the DA matrix; (iii) the PA matrix;
or (iv) the test data used to traverse the ADTree. The simplest
way to use PhosphoChain is to traverse the network (i.e. the
ADTree) using new mRNA expression data to evaluate which
pathways are active. To build a new ADTree, the PA matrix
would have to be changed. To run PhosphoChain on an organ-
ism other than S.cerevisiae, the DA matrix and binding motifs
should be changed. As a proof-of—principle, we better recon-
structed the cell wall (CW) pathway (Supplementary Fig. S10)
by substituting the PA matrix and test data using 64 MAPK
CW-speciﬁc experiments.

PhosphoChain also provides an extensible framework for
studying other post-translational modiﬁcations and, with only
relatively minor modiﬁcations, PhosphoChain could also (i)
use high-throughput data other than mRNA expression; (ii) in-
clude additional biological information; and (iii) be applicable to
human networks.

Because the mechanism connecting phosphorylation and
mRNA expression is probably indirect, there are several other
proxies for activation that might be more informative, or by
inclusion could improve the predictive capabilities of
PhosphoChain. These include, but are not limited to, changes
in the phosphorylation status of kinases and/or phosphatases
themselves and changes in protein localization, which, when
combined with the motif analysis, can be used to infer temporal
and causal regulation.

PhosphoChain might also be made more accurate by expand-
ing the CM (by adding more rules or by making existing rules
more complex) to accommodate the inclusion of additional bio-
logical information. Because the CM is formed using a logical
conjunction of two criteria, it is conceptually simple to add add-
itional criteria. This would be especially useful if those criteria
limited the number of conditions that are true, thereby
reducing the space of possible solutions. For example, kinase
and phosphatase motifs conserved across species are more
likely to be bonafide sites of action (Minguez et al., 2012); there-
fore, it should be useful to add a third criterion specifying
whether or not a motif is conserved. Additionally, incorporating
more information about experimental conditions (such as
salt levels, pathogen exposure) could lead to models that are
more predictive of network activities speciﬁc to environmental
conditions.

To develop PhosphoChain, we took advantage of experimen-
tal perturbations that are most easily performed in model
systems. However, the structure of PhosphoChain enables the
same general approach to be applied in cases where direct
perturbation data are not available as is typical for human dis-
ease networks. In these cases, genetic data, phosphoproteomic
data, expression data, model organism data and so forth can all

be incorporated into the same framework to predict signaling
network activities.

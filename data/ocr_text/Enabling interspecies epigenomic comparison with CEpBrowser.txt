1 INTRODUCTION

Epigenomes play pivotal roles in cell identity, organismal devel-
opment and disease processes (Bernstein et al., 2007; Maunakea
et al., 2010), contribute to regulating cognition and behavior
(Zhang and Meaney, 2010) and reﬂect personal variation
(McDaniell et al., 2010). By integrating environmental signals
with genomic instructions, epigenomes are instrumental in brid-
ging genotypic variation and phenotypic diversity. Leveraging a
number of high-throughput sequencing enabled technologies,
large international consortia are aiming to generate >1000 epi-
genomes from normal tissues and associated disease conditions
(Abbott, 2011; Bernstein et al., 2010; The ENCODE Project
Consortium, 2004) [also see Box 1 in Satterlee et a]. (2010)].

Analyzing and interpreting epigenomic information has
become a pressing need. The successes obtained in associating
epigenomic marks with genomic features inspired initial efforts
of systematic annotation of chromatin states (Ernst and Kellis,
2010; Ernst et al., 2011; Zhou et al., 2011). However, our current
capability of interpreting epigenomic information is still primi-
tive. The concept of using cross-species comparison to annotate
epigenomic functions may revolutionize epigenomic analysis
(Feng et al., 2010; Mikkelsen et al., 2010; Milosavljevic, 2010;
Xiao et al., 2012). Indeed, by exploiting the link between evolu-
tionary selection and regulatory functions, ‘comparative
epigenomics’ have annotated epigenomes with unprecedented
details (Xiao et al., 2012).

We have developed the Comparative Epigenome Browser
(CEpBrowser) to allow the public to perform multi-species
epigenomic analysis. The web-based CEpBrowser extends
the concepts of the UCSC and Ensembl Genome Browsers

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Flicek et al., 2011; Kent et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2009) to inte-
grate, manage and visualize large sequencing-based datasets for
cross-species comparisons.

2 DESIGN PRINCIPLE AND KEY FEATURES

The design principle of CEpBrowser is to maximize the efﬁciency
of interspecies epigenomic comparisons. Five key features were
designed based on this principle. First, the epigenomic data from
multiple species are presented side-by-side (Fig. 1, right). This
simultaneous presentation of non-genome-sequence features of
multiple species is different from other genome browsers (Kent
et al., 2002; Zhu et al., 2009), which display one genome at a time
as the basis, and they superimpose other information onto this
basis. To present multi-species data in parallel, CEpBrowser ver-
tically divides its visualization area into multiple panels, using
each panel to display the genomic annotation and epigenomic
features of one species. CEpBrowser allows user to specify any
genomic region of interest, and it displays this region in a panel.
In the meantime, CEpBrowser finds and visualizes comparable
genomic regions in other species in the other panels. The com-
parable genomic regions are identiﬁed by an algorithm that
maximizes the number of orthologous sequences (color blocks,
Fig. 1) in the user’s region of interest. The epigenomic data of the
other species are then superimposed onto these comparable gen-
omic regions. The default presentation of the epigenomic data is
a compact form [the ‘dense view’ (Kent et al., 2002)], allowing for
visually comparing as many epigenomic features across species as
possible.

The second key feature is the automatic color-coding of epi-
genomic data based on the orthology of their underlying gen-
omic sequences. The same color is used to shade orthologous
sequences and the epigenomic data on the orthologous sequences
in every species. This allows users to easily compare the epigen-
omes within each color block. For example, the strong signals of
H3K4me2/3 and H3K27ac in the promoter of human ZFP42
(gray block, top, Fig. l) are conserved as strong signals in mice
(gray block, Day 0 tracks, middle panel), but they are not con-
served in pigs (gray block, bottom). Gain or loss of orthologous
sequences can also be easily spotted (yellow blocks).

The third key feature is the synchronized navigation of mul-
tiple species. When activated, this feature allows users to navigate
the genome and epigenomes of a species while automatically
tracing and visualizing the genomes and epigenomes of other
species. For example, when the user zooms, shifts or jumps her
view of the human genome and epigenomes, the views of mouse
and pig genomes and epigenomes are updated in synchrony. This
synchronization feature maximizes the number of orthologous
sequences in the user’s view.

Fig. 1. The multi-species alignment track. The main visualization area is split into three vertical panels, showing the genomes and epigenomes of humans,
mice, and pigs. The top panel displays a human genomic region near the ZFP42 gene. Unﬁltered sequencing data from ChIP-seq and other technologies
are shown in epigenomic tracks (H3K4me1 etc.) in dense view in grayscale. The darkness reﬂects the number of overlapping sequencing reads at a
genomic location. The middle and lower panels show the epigenomic data on comparable genomic regions in mice and pigs. Orthologous sequences are
marked by the same color. These color-coded blocks clarify what epigenomic data are on orthologous sequences and thus comparable. On the left are
three auxiliary panels for searching genes, selecting and navigating genomic regions, and controlling the synchronization of navigation (Master control).
On the right is the button to call out the Track Selection Panel (hidden), which controls the track display and synchronization. The expression tracks

show the RNA-seq data in the full view (inserts)

The fourth key feature is the synchronization of epigenomic
tracks. Users can turn off the epigenomic tracks that are speciﬁc
to some species, thus leaving the shared epigenomic tracks easily
comparable. More importantly, the tracks of the same epige-
nomic mark can be simultaneously displayed or hid in every
species. Finally, epigenomic tracks are automatically sorted
into the same order in every species.

The ﬁfth key feature is a simultaneous display of different
tracks with different formats. The RNA-seq tracks are displayed
in the ‘full view’ (Expression panels, Fig. 1), whereas other tracks
are displayed in the dense view. This is particularly useful because
the dense view is needed for juxtaposing many epigenomic marks
in multiple species, whereas the RNA-seq data require the full
view to provide a good sense of the expression levels. This feature
allows associating interspecies epigenomic changes with the evo-
lutionary changes of gene expression. For example, the conserva-
tion patterns of H3K4me2/3 and H3K27ac in human, mouse and
pig pluripotent stem cells are in concordance with the conserva-
tion pattern of ZF P42 expression levels. H3K4me2/3 and
H3K27ac showed a strong—strong—weak pattern on human,
mouse and pig orthologous regions upstream to ZFP42 (gray
blocks, Fig. l), which correlated to the high—high—low expression
pattern of ZFP42 in the three species (Expression panels, Fig. 1).

Besides these ﬁve key features, users can interactively interro-
gate the data using a set of auxiliary panels. The Gene Query

Panel (upper left, Fig. 1) allows searching by gene names.
CEpBrowser will recommend gene names by text similarity
while the user is typing (Supplementary Fig. Sl). The user
input is compared with gene aliases from NCBI and Ensembl
gene databases, and all matching or partially matching results
will be listed. When genes are found by aliases, the alias will be
marked in parentheses next to the canonical names. Users can
select to visualize any of the listed genes with the Gene Selection
Panel (Supplementary Fig. S2). When multiple species are dis-
played in parallel, the user can redirect the displayed region of
any species with the Navigation Panel (lower left, Fig. l). The
‘master control’ tools provide a synchronized control of all spe-
cies, allowing users to zoom or shift the displayed regions in
parallel (Supplementary Fig. S3). The Track Selection Panel
(shown as a button on the upper right corner in Fig. l and
Supplementary Fig. S4) allows displaying or hiding any tracks,
or a group of related tracks. It also allows changing track display
between full and dense formats (Supplementary Fig. SS).

3 DATA SUPPORT

CEpBrowser supports data download and data submission.
Users can access the ‘data download and more’ panel to down-
load all data tracks in CEpBrowser. Incorporation of new public
data is enabled by an automated pipeline that converts mapped

sequencing reads into the WIG format that can be managed and
displayed on CEpBrowser. CEpBrowser has incorporated 70
ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, MRE—seq, MeDIP—seq datasets in three
mammalian species (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2) (Chen
et al., 2008; Goren et al., 2010; Lister et al., 2009; Rada-
Iglesias et al., 2011; Xiao et al., 2012; Yu et al., 2013), allowing
for comparing the epigenomes of pluripotent stem cells and dif-
ferent differentiation routes. Future work includes expanding to
other species and other cell types. These developments require
the community’s efforts in generating comparable epigenome
maps in multiple species.

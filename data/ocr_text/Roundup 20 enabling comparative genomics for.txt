ABSTRACT

Summary: Roundup is an online database of gene orthologs for over
1800 genomes, including 226 Eukaryota, 1447 Bacteria, 113 Archaea
and 21 Viruses. Orthologs are inferred using the Reciprocal Smallest
Distance algorithm. Users may query Roundup for single-linkage
clusters of orthologous genes based on any group of genomes.
Annotated query results may be viewed in a variety of ways including
as clusters of orthologs and as phylogenetic profiles. Genomic results
may be downloaded in formats suitable for functional as well as
phylogenetic analysis, including the recent OrthoXML standard. In
addition, gene IDs can be retrieved using FASTA sequence search.
All source code and orthologs are freely available.

1 INTRODUCTION

Orthologs are genes from different organisms that descend from a
single ancestral gene in the most recent common ancestor (Fitch,
1970). In comparative genomics, they are used to infer the function
of novel genes from the function of well-studied ones, to construct
phylogenies and explore the evolution of genes and species, and to
study sequence conservation and change. They are also valuable in
analyzing gene networks, studying gene gain and loss, and ﬁnding
genes in model organisms that correspond to human disease genes
(Altenhoff and Dessimoz 2009; Gabaldon et al., 2009; Kristensen
et al., 2011).

Advances in high-throughput genomic sequencing have made it
possible to produce many datasets in a relatively short time period.
For example, from 2006 to 2011, the number of complete proteomes
listed in UniProtKB (Magrane and Consortium, 2011), a repository
of annotated protein sequences, has increased from around 300 to
over 2500. To overcome the engineering challenges of computing
and publishing orthologs for such a large number of genomes,
we redesigned the comparative genomics tool, Roundup (DeLuca
et al., 2006), to scale with the rate of genome sequencing and
to enable increasingly more sophisticated comparative genomics
analyses. Roundup 2.0 contains orthology data for over 1800
genomes, providing one of the largest diversities among similar

orthology databases (Chen et al., 2006; Datta et al., 2009; Huerta-
Cepas et al., 2011; Kristensen et al., 2011; Li et al., 2006; Linard
et al., 2011; Ostlund et al., 2010; Rouard et al., 2011; Schneider
et al., 2007; Tatusov et al., 2003). Roundup compares well to
other major databases, with recent studies showing similar ortholog
composition for model organisms (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009;
Chen et al., 2007). The data in Roundup include clusters of orthologs
for a wide range of sequence conservation, allowing searches
for distant orthologs, and also phylogenetic proﬁles that enable
functional investigation, phylogenetic analysis and prediction of
network organization (Cui et al., 2011).

2 ALGORITHMS

We used the reciprocal smallest distance (RSD) (Wall et al.,
2003) algorithm to infer orthologs. RSD improves the sensitivity
of reciprocal best blast hits by considering global alignment and
maximum likelihood evolutionary distance between sequences. As
a pairwise orthology algorithm, RSD scales quadratically with
the number of genomes in Roundup. Altenhoff et al. assessed 10
ortholog inference projects and methods, conﬁrming the reliable
performance of RSD over a wide array of genomes from the tree of
life (Altenhoff and Dessimoz, 2009).

For Roundup 2.0, we changed RSD to improve its speed,
stability and ortholog inference. We replaced WU—BLAST (W.Gish,
personal communication) with NCBI BLAST (Altschul et al.,
1990). Also, we replaced ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994) with
Kalign (Lassmann and Sonnhammer, 2005). Kalign is faster than
ClustalW and produces better alignments for more distantly related
sequences. This change resulted in 9% closer maximum likelihood
distances between orthologs computed using PAML 4.0 (Yang,
2007), and 0.3% more orthologs on average. Since the Roundup
database stores orthologs for 12 combinations of divergence and
E -Value thresholds, RSD was modiﬁed to compute orthologs for any
number of parameter combinations as quickly as for one parameter
combination. This change should be of interest to researchers
investigating the effect of different parameter settings and degree of
global sequence similarity on ortholog inference. With the addition
of other caching and ﬁle I/O changes, RSD is over six times faster
than the previous version in our performance tests.

In addition to housing the orthologs inferred by RSD, Roundup
builds clusters of orthologous genes, i.e. ortholog groups, using
deterministic single-linkage clustering. It partitions a graph into
connected subgraphs by creating a cluster for every gene and then

merging two clusters if a gene in one of the clusters is orthologous
to a gene in the other one. The result is that every gene in a group is
orthologous to at least one other gene in the group and to no genes
in any other groups. In contrast to other orthology databases (Chen
et al., 2006; Schneider et al., 2007; Tatusov et al., 2003), Roundup
orthologous groups are built on the ﬂy using genomes selected by the
user. This allows users to include exactly their genomes of interest
and to explore the effects of including different genomes on the
grouping of orthologs.

3 GENOMES AND ORTHOLOGS

The 1807 genomes in Roundup 2.0 are from UniProtKB (Magrane
and Consortium, 2011), including 226 Eukaryota, 1447 Bacteria, 113
Archaea, 21 Viruses and Viroids. The approximately 63 CPU core-
years to compute the orthologs took several weeks on our research
computing cluster. Roundup used a fault-tolerant computational
pipeline to compute orthologs for all 1631721 pairs of genomes
across 12 parameter combinations selected to allow researchers
access to results for a broad range of divergence and E-Value
threshold settings. As a result, there are over 11 billion orthologs
available in Roundup. The genomes and orthologs are updated 2—4
times per year.

4 WEB INTERFACE

The Roundup website provides two ways to search for orthologs.
First, the Browse query is a genome-centric search that retrieves
all orthologs between one genome and a set of other genomes.
Results can be ﬁltered by gene name or gene identiﬁer. To aid
users in ﬁnding gene identiﬁers, a FASTA sequence may be used to
retrieve a gene id. The second query, Retrieve, returns all orthologs
for all pairs of genomes in a set of genomes the user speciﬁes.
Query results are then clustered into groups of orthologous genes as
described above. All genes in the groups are linked to UniProt and
annotated with available gene names and GO Process terms provided
by UniProtKB and Gene Ontology (Ashburner et al., 2000). FASTA
sequences for genes in orthologous groups are also provided for
further analysis.

In addition to the standard View of search results, there are
summaries by GO Terms and by Gene Clusters. The orthologous
groups may be downloaded in several formats: NEXUS, PHYLIP,
OrthoXML, Phylogenetic Proﬁle and Text. OrthoXML (Schmitt
et al., 2011) is provided to support interoperability with other
Orthology databases and the quest for orthologs (Gabaldon et al.,
2009; Kuzniar et al., 2008). Query results are cached for up to 30
days and may be retrieved by using the initial URL.

To support research and replication, we make available for
download from the website: FASTA sequences for genomes;
orthologs in OrthoXML and text formats; and code for RSD and
Roundup. Orthologs are also available through an HTTP-based API.

Roundup 2.0 is an important step forward towards keeping pace
with the rate of genome sequencing. The features and ﬂexibility
of Roundup 2.0, coupled with the wide coverage of genomes,
enables increasingly large-scale comparative genomics analyses that

address key questions in phylogeny, genome evolution and systems
biology.

Abstract

Summary: Robust conversion between microarray platforms is needed to leverage the wide var—
iety of microarray expression studies that have been conducted to date. Currently available conver—
sion methods rely on manufacturer annotations, which are often incomplete, or on direct align—
ment of probes from different platforms, which often fail to yield acceptable genewise correlation.
Here, we describe aRrayLasso, which uses the Lasso—penalized generalized linear model to model
the relationships between individual probes in different probe sets. We have implemented
aRrayLasso in a set of five open—source R functions that allow the user to acquire data from public
sources such as Gene Expression Omnibus, train a set of Lasso models on that data and directly
map one microarray platform to another. aRrayLasso significantly predicts expression levels with
similar fidelity to technical replicates of the same RNA pool, demonstrating its utility in the integra—
tion of datasets from different platforms.

1 Introduction

A pressing issue in translational biology is the ability to reference and
utilize historical microarray datasets for large—scale discovery pro—
grams (Tsiliki et al., 2014). The appeal of using historical datasets in—
cludes capturing previous investment to construct larger cohorts.
Despite interest in both industry and academia (Tsiliki et 61]., 2014;
Yengi, 2005), few groups have attempted to tackle the problem of
platform integration. Current approaches primarily rely upon passing
different microarray platforms through a common identifier system,
such as EntrezGene IDs, using specially designed packages (Alibes
et 61]., 2007; Mohammad et 61]., 2012) or online tools (Huang et 61].,
2009). While these systems work well in cases where manufacturers
have maintained annotations of their microarray databases, ID—based
conversion methods fail for deprecated and undermaintained micro—
array platforms. Another approach to convert between platforms is

sequenced—based, wherein each sequence tag is aligned to the genome
or transcriptome and annotated (Fumagalli et 61]., 2014; Liu et 61].,
2007). Unfortunately, it is often the case that de novo annotations do
not capture the complexity of the transcriptome (e.g. for genes with
alternative splice variants Gambino et 61]., 2015).

To address the shortcomings of both annotation— and sequence—
based conversion methods, we have developed aRrayLasso, a Lasso—
regression based network model. Our method directly predicts the
probe expression levels of the target platform. To demonstrate the
accuracy of our method, we show that predictions made using
aRrayLasso are of similar accuracy to technical replicates from the 6
same mRNA pool. Our methodology allows users to utilize cur—
rently available methodologies for integrating cross—experiment
microarray datasets (Tsiliki et 61]., 2014) and allow for the construc—
tion of large—cohort retrospective studies.

2 Methods

To convert from a source to a target microarray platform, we chose
to model each individual sequence tag in the target platform as a lin-
ear combination of all sequence tags from the source platform (see
Fig. 1 and Supplementary Methods). Because microarrays have
greater than 10 000 individual probes, we chose to use the Lasso al—
gorithm for generalized linear regression (Friedman et 61]., 2010).
The Lasso algorithm allows the resulting linear model to be ‘sparse’
in that only the most relevant and robust (by cross—validation) pre—
dictors are assigned non—zero values. This optimization allows the
model to outperform similar models that require all predictors to be
assigned non—zero coefficients (Tibshirani et 61]., 2010). Lasso is im—
plemented in the R package ‘glmnet,’ allowing for ease of use
(Friedman et 61]., 2010).

We first generate a list of lasso models for each sequence tag in
the target microarray platform. Our implementation can take as in—
put a variety of data formats, including expression matrices, R
expressionSet objects and Gene Expression Omnibus accession
numbers (Edgar et 61]., 2002). Once the full list of models has been
computed, we provide functions that allow either the straightfor-
ward prediction of sequence tag values or the validation of the
model list by calculation of Pearson product—moment correlation
coefficients.

To demonstrate the utility of our methodology, we utilized three
datasets: (i) GSE6313, containing C5 7/B6 adult mouse retina cDNA
profiles (Liu et 61]., 2007), (ii) GSE7785, containing PANC—l derived
cDNA profiles (Tan et 61]., 2003) and (iii) GSE4854, containing
mouse cortex expression profiles (Kuo et 61]., 2006). Each dataset is
composed of multiple technical replicates for several distinct micro—
array platforms (see Supplementary Table S1). For both datasets, we
used aRrayLasso to first train models to intraconvert between each
individual platform and then predicted intraconversions between
each pair of platforms for all technical replicates. To assess the ac—
curacy of our conversions, we calculated the average Pearson’s r
between the predicted values and actual experimental values for each
platform and replicate. We also calculated the average inter—replicate
Pearson’s r for each platform (see Supplementary Table 82).

3 Results

To explore the performance of aRrayLasso, we began by comparing
our method’s ability to predict expression to the biological variation
between replicates on the same platform. We assessed the degree to
which aRrayLasso could accurately predict platform interconver—
sions in three datasets, representative of different experimental sys—
tems, organisms and platforms. For the five platforms tested,

aRrayLasso predictions are within the technical variation of each
microarray platform when compared with technical replicates from
the same cDNA pool, even when subjected to multiple sequential
conversions (Supplementary Table 82). In addition, once built,
aRrayLasso models can be used between experimental conditions:
using the models built on GSE6313, we predicted expression levels
in GSE4854 with no significant loss of signal (Pearsons product—mo—
ment correlation, P < 0.38). While the results presented here do not
guarantee similar results for all training and testing datasets, these
analyses serve as a promising proof of concept. Furthermore, our
success with a relatively small dataset suggests that aRrayLasso may
reach even higher levels of performance as the size of the datasets
involved increases.

4 Discussion

Implementation: In this investigation, we propose a data—driven
method for integrating across high—throughput genomic measure—
ment modalities that avoids the use of annotation— or sequence
alignment—based tools. We have implemented a Lasso regression—
based modeling approach to model the expression level of each
sequence tag in a target microarray as a linear combination of all
sequence tags in a source microarray. Our implementation repre-
sents a straightforward, easy—to—use and open—source methodology
for conversion between microarray platforms.

Limitations: One drawback of our method is the need for ex—
tant or newly generated matched samples in the source and target
platforms. In our experience, however, there are a large number
of datasets available that have matched samples with replicates
for a number of popular microarray platforms. A second limita—
tion to our method is in conversion which lack overlap in gene
coverage. In these cases, as with currently available methodolo—
gies, our method will fail to provide meaningful conversions.
Lastly, while we have shown in one case that interexperiment
conversions are feasible, we caution that systematic technical
error in a single experiment may lead to the creation of a biased
model. In general, however, when coupled with one of several
cross—experiment dataset integration tools, aRrayLasso will en—
able mining of the remarkable and untapped historical pool of
microarray datasets for large—scale metastudies for well—powered
discovery.

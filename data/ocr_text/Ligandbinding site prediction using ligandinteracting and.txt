ABSTRACT

Motivation: Knowledge about the site at which a ligand binds
provides an important clue for predicting the function of a protein
and is also often a prerequisite for performing docking computations
in virtual drug design and screening. We have previously shown that
certain ligand-interacting triangles of protein atoms, called protein
triangles, tend to occur more frequently at ligand-binding sites than
at other parts of the protein.

Results: In this work, we describe a new ligand-binding site
prediction method that was developed based on binding site-
enriched protein triangles. The new method was tested on 2
benchmark datasets and on 19 targets from two recent community-
based studies of such predictions, and excellent results were
obtained. Where comparisons were made, the success rates for the
new method for the first predicted site were significantly better than
methods that are not a meta-predictor. Further examination showed
that, for most of the unsuccessful predictions, the pocket of the
ligand-binding site was identified, but not the site itself, whereas for
some others, the failure was not due to the method itself but due
to the use of an incorrect biological unit in the structure examined,
although using correct biological units would not necessarily improve
the prediction success rates. These results suggest that the new
method is a valuable new addition to a suite of existing structure-
based bioinformatics tools for studies of molecular recognition and
related functions of proteins in post-genomics research.

1 INTRODUCTION

The number of sequences and structures of protein of unknown
function is increasing rapidly as a result of genome research.
These proteins can usually be assigned a putative function if
their ligand—binding sites can be predicted. As such, ligand—binding
site prediction (LBSP) is now a competition category in critical

assessment of protein structure prediction (CASP) experiments
(Lopez et al., 2009). LB SP is also often the starting point for protein—
ligand docking, the core methodology for virtual screening in drug
design and development (Laurie and Jackson, 2006; Leis et al.,
2010).

Ligands usually bind at speciﬁc sites of target proteins, and it
is, therefore, generally believed that ligand—binding sites can be
distinguished from other parts of the protein surface by certain
speciﬁc features, for example, the electrostatic potential and size
of a cavity formed on the protein surface. Many LB SP algorithms
based on this line of thinking have been proposed in the past
decade. Generally, the main difference between these algorithms is
whether they perform geometric computations to identify cavities,
i.e. binding site pockets, on the protein surface.

Many methods that compute binding site pockets (Brady and
Stouten, 2000; Hendlich et al., 1997; Huang and Schroeder, 2006;
Laskowski, 1995; Levitt and Banaszak, 1992; Liang et al., 1998;
Weisel et al., 2007; Yu et al., 2010; Zhu and Pisabarro, 2010), also
known as geometry—based methods (Laurie and Jackson, 2006; Leis
et al., 2010), have been developed based on the assumption that a
ligand always binds in the largest cavity in its target protein. This is,
of course, not 100% correct but is a reasonable starting point, and
the assumption has been shown to be correct ~70% of the time in
an analysis of a set of 210 known protein—ligand complex structures
(Huang and Schroeder, 2006). However, how to precisely identify
empty spaces (i.e. cavities) on the protein surface and determine their
size is not trivial, as different cavity—computing algorithms do not
always give the same result for the same protein structure (Huang
and Schroeder, 2006; Laskowski, 1995; Yu et al., 2010; Zhu and
Pisabarro, 2010).

To avoid relying on the inherently incorrect assumption that
the largest cavity is the binding site, a different type of method
searches for energetically favored regions for ligand binding using
energy calculations (An et al., 2005; Goodford, 1985; Kinoshita and
Nakamura, 2003; Laurie and Jackson, 2005; Morita et al., 2008).
To do so, these energy—based methods distribute probes (usually a
sphere representing a small molecule or a chemical group with a
particular function, e. g. hydrophobicity) around the target protein
and calculate the interaction energy between the probes and the
protein atoms with which they are in contact. Probes with favorable
interaction energies are then clustered, and the most energetically
favored region is identiﬁed and predicted to be the ligand—binding
site. As these methods do not aim at identifying the largest cavity,
they are more likely to succeed where geometry—based methods often
fail, e.g. in cases in which the ligand binds in a shallow cavity on

the protein surface; on the other hand, energy calculations may miss
the largest cavity, and they are more expensive to compute and may
require a sophisticated clustering scheme. Furthermore, in LBSP
applications, the ligand molecule is usually not known, and it is
difﬁcult to devise a probe system that can simulate a variety of
chemical properties to cover the large possible number of unknown
ligands.

As more and more protein structures are deposited in the PDB
(Berman et al., 2000), homology—based methods (Brylinski and
Skolnick, 2008; Laskowski et al., 2005; Lopez et al., 2011; Roche
et al., 2011; Wass and Sternberg, 2009; Wass et al., 2010; Zhang,
2008), in which one ﬁnds structures resembling that of the target
protein and predicts the ligand—binding site by inferring homology
through structural alignments, have become viable; these can be
more reliable than other methods but require the availability of
homologous structures with known ligand—binding sites (Wass et al.,
2011).

Another strategy that can be applied, thanks to the increase in
structure data, is to statistically identify features that may have
been evolutionarily imprinted in ligand—binding sites. Such methods
are propensity—based methods. For example, Soga et al. (2007)
found that the amino acid composition at ligand—binding sites is
signiﬁcantly different from that at non—binding site protein surfaces
and that the difference between the two could be used to rescore the
binding site pockets reported by others to improve the success rates
of LB SP.

As these different strategies have different strengths and
weaknesses, methods, such as Fpocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009;
Schmidtke et al., 2010), that combine different strategies show
potential to perform better than single—strategy methods. Indeed,
using consensus of results of other methods, i.e. performing meta—
predictions, MetaPocket 2.0 (MPK2) reports the best LB SP success
rates to date (Zhang et al., 2011). Finally, residue conservation
is a critical property for increasing the success rate of LBSP and
is commonly incorporated in LBSP methods (Capra et al., 2009;
Gutteridge et al., 2003; Huang and Schroeder, 2006; Wass et al.,
2011).

In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for predicting
protein’s ligand—binding sites. This is an extension of our previous
work (Xie and Hwang, 2010), in which we developed a novel
docking score function, MotifScore, based on network motifs of
3D protein—ligand contacts (i.e. interactions). During the derivation
of MotifScore, we observed that some of the 3D protein—
ligand interaction motifs contributed much more signiﬁcantly to
MotifScore than others and that their three constituent protein atoms,
which form a triangle on the protein surface, were often seen
together, i.e. were concomitantly enriched, at the ligand—binding
sites. This new LB SP method was named LISE on the basis that these
protein triangles are Ligand Interacting and binding Site Enriched.
Benchmark predictions using the same set of structural data and the
same evaluation criteria showed that, in cases where comparisons
were made, LISE outperformed other methods on the whole, often
with a signiﬁcantly better accuracy for the ﬁrst predicted site (i.e.
topl prediction). Furthermore, in a prediction for 19 recent CASP
targets with a ‘full’ ligand molecule, as opposed to an ion or small
solvent molecule, LISE correctly identiﬁed 17 (89%) as the topl
site, a level of accuracy similar to that achieved for the benchmark
predictions, suggesting that LISE can be an accurate and reliable
LBSP tool in helping to annotate proteins of unknown function.

2 METHODS

2.1 Protein triangles, binding-site enrichment factors
and triangle scores

As described previously (Xie and Hwang, 2010), MotifScore was constructed
by counting the occurrences of motifs of 3D protein—ligand interaction
networks extracted from 6276 protein—ligand complex structures. These
motifs capture interactions between three protein atoms and two ligand
atoms, those contributing signiﬁcantly to MotifScore being found to occur
preferentially at ligand—binding sites. The three protein atoms of a motif thus
derived form a triangle bounded by the constraints that all three sides of the
triangle must be longer than 2 A and shorter than 13 A and at least two sides
must be shorter than 10A (Xie and Hwang, 2010). The triangle, referred
to as a protein triangle, is actually an atom—type triangle, because different
atoms of similar chemical nature are assigned to the same atom type (all the
protein atoms are represented by 1 of 13 atom types, see Table 1 in Xie and
Hwang (2010); throughout this article, hydrogen atoms are ignored when
protein or ligand atoms are mentioned). Each protein triangle is associated
with a binding site enrichment factor, F b, which is derived from a statistical
analysis of protein triangles found in both ligand binding and non—ligand
binding parts of the protein and reﬂects the propensity of a protein triangle
to occur at the ligand—binding site (Xie and Hwang, 2010).

To cut down computational cost, in this work, we only considered those
protein triangles with a non—zero solvent accessible surface area for all
their three atoms. In addition, those with an Fb <1 were ignored; these
omissions constituting a large percentage (>70%) of the total number of
protein triangles found at the protein surface but only making a marginal
contribution to the triangle score (St) deﬁned below (see Supplementary
Figs SI and S2).

St=Fb+wZCi (1)
i=1

where C,- is the conservation score of the residue to which the ith (i = 1, 2, 3)
atom of the triangle belongs, and w is a weighting factor, which, in this
work, was determined in preliminary tests to be 1.7 for optimal performance
(data not shown). The conservation score was taken directly from PSI—
BLAST’s PSSM (position—speciﬁc scoring matrix; Altschul at 611., 1997).
The conservation score made a minor contribution to LISE, increasing its
success rates by several percentages in some of the benchmark predictions
(see Section 3 and Supplementary Table S1).

2.2 Grids, sphere of grids and sphere
(binding site) scores

To identify hot spots for ligand binding using the triangle scores, we created
a regular 3D grid with a step size of 1A surrounding the target protein and
labeled each grid point as either ‘protein—occupied’ or ‘empty’, depending
on whether a protein atom could be found within 2.7 A of the grid point. For
each empty grid point, a grid point score, Sg, was calculated as the sum of
the triangle scores, St [Equation ( 1)], of the surrounding protein triangles:

5g = 25, (2)

where n is the number of protein triangles in which the geometric center
falls within 4 A of the empty grid point under consideration. A sphere 11 A
in diameter and centered on each empty grid point was then created, and a
sphere score, SS [Equation (3)], was calculated as the sum of the grid point
scores, Sg [Equation (2)], for all the empty grid points found within the
sphere, and the number of empty grid points found was m:

55:25g (3)

Finally, spheres were ranked according to their sphere score, SS, and the ﬁrst
(top ranked) predicted site was assigned to the sphere with the highest SS, the

second was assigned to the sphere with the highest SS for all spheres centered
at least 8.25 A (1.5 times the sphere’s radius of 5.5 A) from the center of the
ﬁrst sphere, the third was assigned following the same procedure and had
to be located at least 8.25 A from both the ﬁrst and second site and so on
for subsequent ranked spheres. Note that, although all the above distance
parameters may seem arbitrary, they are in line with considerations of protein
and atom structures and are either identical to, or within the range of, those
used in related studies (Capra et al., 2009; Gutteridge et al., 2003; Huang
and Schroeder, 2006; Laskowski, 1995; Muegge and Martin, 1999; Ruvinsky
and Kozintsev, 2005; Xie and Hwang, 2010). Figure 1 shows an example in
which the ﬁrst three top—ranked ligand—binding sites predicted by LISE for
the immunoglobulin B1—8 fv fragment (PDB 1a6w) are labeled, with each
site (sphere) ﬁlled with empty grid points colored according to the value of
their score, Sg, as indicated by the accompanying color spectrum.

2.3 Criteria for assessing binding site predictions

Different criteria have been proposed to evaluate whether an LBSP is a
success or a failure. Of these, the most widely used are a distance criterion
and a precision criterion. The distance criterion checks the distances between
a single point, usually the geometric center of the predicted ligand—binding
site, and all the atoms of the ligand and dictates that at least one of those
distances must be <4 A for the prediction to be considered a success (Huang
and Schroeder, 2006). The precision criterion checks what percentage of
the grid points within a predicted binding site are within 1.6A of any of
the ligand atoms and dictates that the percentage should be greater than a
speciﬁed percentage (e. g. 25% or 0%) for the prediction to be considered a
success (Laurie and Jackson, 2005). In this work, we used both criteria to
compare our results with the results generated using other methods reported
in the literature.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Comparison with other methods

Different datasets and different criteria have been used to evaluate
the performance of LBSP methods. For comparison with other
methods, LISE was evaluated on two benchmark datasets, using
the same evaluation criteria used by the other methods.

methods using 210 ligand—bound structuresa

aThe success rates were computed as the percentage of the 210 structures for which the
best (topl) or any one of the best three (top3) predicted binding sites satisﬁed the 4 A
distance criterion (see Section 2).

bWithout considering residue conservation [Equation (1)], the success rates were 76%
(topl) and 90% (top3).

CThe success rates of these LBSP methods were taken from (Huang, 2009).

Table 1 presents a comparison of the topl and top3 success rates
for LISE for a set of 210 ligand—bound protein structures with
those reported in the literature on four geometry—based methods
[LIGSITECS and its improved version LIGSITECSC, which takes
residue conservation into consideration (Huang and Schroeder,
2006), PASS (Brady and Stouten, 2000) and SURFNET (Laskowski,
1995)], the energy—based method Q—SiteFinder (Laurie and Jackson,
2005) and two meta—predictors MPKl (Huang, 2009) and MPK2
(Zhang et al., 2011), which make their predictions based on a
consensus of those of four and eight other methods, respectively.
These success rates were evaluated using the ‘distance’ criterion
(see Section 2). The results showed that LISE was superior to all
the non—meta predictors, particularly as regards performance on the
topl success rates, and was comparable with MPK2.

Another widely used dataset for evaluating LB SP performance is a
set of 48 proteins for which PDB structures for both the ligand—bound
and unbound forms are available (Huang and Schroeder, 2006).
There is some overlap between this dataset and the 210 bound—
only structure set (29 bound structures in common), but results for
more methods are available for comparison using this dataset. As
presented in Table 2, these include six additional geometry—based
methods, CAST (Liang et al., 1998), PocketPicker (Weisel et al.,
2007), MSPocket (Zhu and Pisabarro, 2010), VICE (Tripathi and
Kellogg, 2010), DoGSITE (Volkamer et al., 2010) and POCASA
(Yu et al., 2010), as well as Fpocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009),
which incorporates structural and physicochemical properties for
its prediction. In general, predictions for the bound form are more
likely to succeed than those for the unbound form, indicating
that, as for docking computations [e.g. Shih and Hwang (2012)],
binding—induced conformational changes present some difﬁculties
for LBSP, as noted previously (Huang and Schroeder, 2006; Laurie
and Jackson, 2005). Table 2 shows that, for the bound forms, LISE
again produced better topl success rates than the other methods,
though, as with the results shown in Table 1, the improvement going
from topl to top3 was less signiﬁcant than other methods. For the
unbound forms, LISE obtained similar results with MPK2 and VICE.
However, it should be mentioned that MPK2 is a meta—predictor that
built on results of other methods (Zhang et al., 2011), and VICE used

those for the unbound structures, though the correct answer could usually be obtained
after the third predicted site.

a set of parameters different from default for this dataset (Tripathi
and Kellogg, 2010).

We also evaluated the performance of LISE and three other
methods on the same 48 bound/unbound structures shown in Table
2 but using a different evaluation criterion, the ‘precision’ criterion
(Laurie and Jackson, 2005) (see Section 2). The three other methods
were the geometry—based POCASA (Yu et al., 2010), the energy—
based Q—SiteFinder (Laurie and Jackson, 2005) and the structure and
physicochemistry—based Fpocket (Le Guilloux et al., 2009). These
methods were chosen because their Internet server provides output
data that can be used to compute the success rates using different
precision criteria. As shown in Table 3, for all these methods, the
success rates for a precision >0% were similar, or even identical,
to those using the 4A, distance criterion (Table 2), and they all

decreased when a much more stringent criterion (precision >25 %)
was used, though the extent of the decrease varied from just a few
percent for Q—SiteFinder to as much as 20% for the other methods.
However, LISE again yielded the best success rates, especially for
the topl site. LISEs predictions could be made more precise and
obtain better success rates for a precision >25% by removing grid
points with very low grid point scores, but this resulted in poorer
results obtained using the distance criterion shown in Tables 1 and 2
(data not shown), underscoring the different emphases of different
evaluation criteria (see Section 4).

3.2 Analysis of unsuccessful cases

Further analysis by visual inspection of the prediction results
revealed that, in the 13 cases (6%) in which LISE failed to correctly
predict the ligand—binding site within the top three best—scored sites
for the 210 bound structures set, it did so because of one of four
reasons, summarized below and also in Supplementary Table S2a:

(i) The pocket was identiﬁed but not the precise ligand—binding
site. Many of LISEs unsuccessful predictions placed the
sphere of the top—ranked site (see Section 2) in the same pocket
as the ligand—binding site, but the sphere, although close to
where the ligand bound, only covered a small part, or even
none, of the ligand. For example, of the 13 unsuccessfully
predicted cases in the 210 structure set, 6 were kinases with a
similar 3D structure, and, for these kinase structures, the ﬁrst
predicted sphere was at the deeper end of a large binding site
pocket, entirely missing 5 of the 6 ligands (see Supplementary
Fig. S3). The shortest distance between the center of the
sphere and the one ligand overlapped a little by the sphere
was 4.5 A, slightly greater than the threshold for success. The
same applied to the prediction for yeast hexokinase b (2yhx),
for which the shortest distance was 4.2 A.

Prediction of ligand-binding site

 

(ii) The use of an incomplete biological unit that did not contain
all subunit chains. The functional unit for some proteins
may consist of more than the single chain presented in
the PDB ﬁle; when the correct biological unit, as reported
in PDBsum (Laskowski et al., 1997), was constructed and
used for prediction, LISE could correctly identify the ligand—
binding site, which often occurs at a subunit interface, as
illustrated by the example of acyltransferase (lcla and 3cla;
Fig. 2). However, using biological units according to PDB sum
would not necessarily improve the success rates, because the
added pocket space at the subunit interface would create new
spheres, which could alter LISEs sphere ranking; for this
study, the number of the cases moved up to within top3 was
smaller than those moved out (3 versus 6), resulting in up to
4% decrease in the success rates (details in Supplementary
Table S3).

(iii) A non—biological ligand. Some of the PDB structures used for
LB SP may contain ligand molecules that are not the biological
ligand of the protein but are agents used to reduce disulﬁde
bonds or assist crystallization. For example, the ligand beta—
mercaptoethanol in the PDB structure of bacteriophage T4
lysozyme (PDB 1182) binds at a site different from the
enzyme’s catalytic site (Hurley et al., 1992), and LISEs ﬁrst
predicted sphere overlapped with the catalytic site but not the
ligand in the PDB structure (Supplementary Fig. S4).

(iv) A small ligand interaction area. Two unsuccessful cases for the
210 bound structures set, lectin (2msb) and glucanotransferase
(lcdg), shared a common feature in having a very small
ligand—binding site, about a quarter or a half, respectively,
of that in a complex (e. g. 1d3h) with a ligand of comparable
size (see Supplementary Fig. S5).

Of the 48 bound/unbound structures, LISE failed to correctly predict
ﬁve pairs (within the top3 sites) for either the bound or the unbound
form, or both (Supplementary Table S2b). Two were due to the
reasons ‘the pocket was identiﬁed, but not the precise ligand—
binding site’ for lqpe (bound)/3lck (unbound), one of the kinase
structures (Supplementary Fig. S3), and ‘the use of an incomplete
biological unit that did not contain all subunit chains’ for the insulin
complex, 3mth (bound)/6ins (unbound) (Supplementary Fig. S6).
In the other three cases, LISE correctly predicted the bound form,
but not the unbound form, resulting in a decrease in success rates
of a few percentages for the unbound form (Table 2). Further
examination showed that, in these three cases, the failure was
caused by either a disordered loop (atom coordinates not available)
at the ligand—binding site for the unbound form (dihydrofolate
reductase, 5dfr) (Supplementary Fig. S7), or, in the case of HIV
protease (4phv/3phv and lida/lhsi), a signiﬁcant change in the
conformation of a binding site loop, which resulted in a much larger
site for the unbound form, and, consequently, some protein triangles
formed in the bound form were lost in the unbound form, pushing
LISEs sphere for this site out of the top three (Supplementary
Fig. S8).

Another complication for LBSP is that some proteins may
have more than one biologically relevant ligand—binding sites. For
example, apart from the active site, HCV polymerase NSSB, which
plays an essential role in viral replication and has attracted much

Fig. 2. LISE identiﬁes the three symmetry—related ligand—binding sites at the
subunit interface of the acyltransferase trimer. The three identical ligands,
depicted by yellow sticks, fell, respectively, within 4 A of the center of LISEs
top three spheres. The three spheres had essentially the same sphere score
[55, Equation (3) in Section 2] and did not form when the monomer structure
of acyltransferase (lcla) was used. The transparent spheres contain grid
points represented by dots colored from blue to red to indicate the normalized
value (see color spectrum) of their grid score [Sg, Equation (2) in Section 2].

ligand—binding sites that can be targeted by small molecules to
inhibit its polymerase function (Bressanelli et al., 2002; Hang et al.,
2009; Le Pogam et al., 2006). As shown in Figure 3, LISEs top
three spheres perfectly matched the three different binding sites of
NSSB, attesting to its ability to suggest potential drug binding sites
in addition to the ﬁrst predicted site.

3.3 Application to CASP8 and CASP9 targets

To further evaluate LISE, we also made predictions for targets in the
LB SP section of CASP8 and CASP9. The ligand—bound structures of
CASP8 and CASP9 targets have been recently determined, and most
have been released in the PDB, making the evaluations possible. Of
the total of 56 targets in these two CASP experiments, we omitted the
37 in which the ligand was either a metal ion or a solvent molecule,
such as glycerol, or the 3D structures are not yet publicly accessible
in the PDB. As shown in Supplementary Table S4, of the 19 targets
(10 from CASP8 and 9 from CASP9) with a full ligand that were
tested, LISE successfully predicted the ligand—binding site as the top—
ranked site for 17 targets. The topl success rate was therefore 89%,
which is similar to those presented earlier for the 210 bound and 48
bound/unbound benchmark datasets, attesting to the robustness of
LISEs predictions.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this study, we showed that LISE, a new LBSP method
derived from 3D motifs of protein—ligand interactions (Xie
and Hwang, 2010), achieved signiﬁcantly better success rates,

Fig. 3. LISE identiﬁes the three different ligand—binding sites of HCV
polymerase NSSB as its top three predicted sites. The protein—ligand complex
structures of HCV polymerase NSSB for the three different ligands (depicted
by sticks), HCV—796 (yellow), NNI—l (orange), or UTP (purple), were solved
separately (PDB 3qu, 2gir and 1gx6, respectively); the three complex
structures could be superimposed well, so, for clarity, the protein structures
of 2gir and 1gx6 are omitted. LISEs top three predicted sites are shown and
labeled, with their grid points (dots) colored according to the grid score, Sg

by the color spectrum. The ﬁgure was created using the VMD program

especially in predicting the top—ranked sites, than a number
of previously reported methods on two benchmark datasets
(Tables 1—3) and equally good success rates for 19 CASP targets
(Supplementary Table S4). Individual examination suggested that
LISEs performance, measured by these success rates, may in fact be
underestimated, as, for example, many of the predictions identiﬁed
the pocket of the ligand—binding site but did not meet the threshold
used for success (Supplementary Table 82a and b and analysis in
Section 3).

LISE is conceptually similar to the propensity—based method of
Mehio et al. (Mehio et al., 2010) in using a triangle of protein
atoms enriched at ligand—binding sites. However, unlike the triplet of
Mehio et al., which composed of three mutually contacting surface
atoms of the protein, LISEs triangles are part of a protein—ligand
interacting motif, with the three protein atoms being simultaneously
in contact with at least two ligand atoms and the size of the
triangle being such that very close and chemically bonded protein
atoms are excluded (Xie and Hwang, 2010). Furthermore, although
the triplet propensities of Mehio et al. are mapped onto protein
surface atoms and residues, LISEs triangle scores are mapped out
into the empty space of the binding site (see Section 2), which
eliminates the requirement in previously reported propensity—based
methods (Mehio et al., 2010; Soga et al., 2007) of using binding
site pockets predicted by other, geometry—based methods, thereby
allowing evaluation to be performed independent of other LBSP
methods.

Different evaluation criteria will affect whether a prediction
is regarded as a success or not, which may lead to different
conclusions about prediction results and performance of the
prediction methods. Furthermore, proteins have evolved diverse
binding sites to accommodate ligands of different sizes and chemical
properties (Grkovic et al., 2003; Ma et al., 2002), and, adding
to this complexity, a small ligand can bind to a large pocket
(e.g. see Supplementary Fig. S9), and all these factors make it
difﬁcult to devise a single criterion to evaluate all the different
LBSP methods objectively. Thus, for example, compared with the
‘coverage’ criterion (An et al., 2005; Gutteridge et al., 2003),
the ‘precision’ criterion (Laurie and Jackson, 2005; Morita et al.,
2008) might allow a more precise assessment of how much of the
predicted pocket is occupied by the ligand but cannot rule out the
possibility that the predicted pocket, even using 100% precision,
covers only a small part of the ligand (Laurie and Jackson, 2005).
Alternatively, avoiding the difﬁculty of choosing a criterion to
evaluate the success rates of LBSP using deﬁned regions of empty
space (i.e. pockets), one can evaluate whether an amino acid residue
is in contact (e. g. within a certain distance) with the ligand for all
the residues, allowing computation of the prediction’s sensitivity and
speciﬁcity (Capra et al., 2009; Wass and Sternberg, 2009). However,
there are cases in which different ligands, which may or may not
be of similar size, bind to the same protein in the same pocket
but in slightly different positions (e.g. Supplementary Fig. S10),
such that a residue considered as a binding site residue for one
ligand becomes a non—binding site residue for another, making the
computed sensitivity and speciﬁcity values somewhat dependent on
the structures containing the particular ligand used. Moreover, as the
purpose of LBSP is usually to identify a pocket on which to carry
out docking computations, a small number of false—positive or false—
negative binding site residues will not seriously compromise the
subsequent work, so long as a pocket, either revealed by clustering
the predicted binding site residues or adopted from those predicted
by other methods, can be identiﬁed.

Given these complications, in this work, we chose to predict the
ligand—binding site as a sphere of a ﬁxed size, 5.5A radius (see
Section 2), which is about the average size of the ligand—binding
sites surveyed by Gutteridge et al. (Gutteridge et al., 2003). Further
analysis also showed that, for most of the successfully predicted
sites, a good percentage (>30%) of the triangles was in contact
with ligand atoms, in comparison with very few (< 10%), if any, for
the unsuccessfully predicted sites (Supplementary Fig. S11). One
obvious limitation of this simple representation is that it does not
reﬂect well the generally non—spherical shape of a protein’s ligand—
binding sites; another drawback is that, for a large site, such as the
examples shown in Supplementary Figures S3, S4 and S6, LISEs
top three spheres were often located in essentially the same pocket,
and this, by not allowing them to be located in other sites, partly
explains the relatively smaller improvement achieved on going from
topl to top3 success rates using LISE compared with other methods
(Tables 1—3). Nevertheless, the fact that this simple scheme did not
prevent LISE from attaining excellent results is encouraging. The
results also suggest that the protein triangles of the protein—ligand
interaction motifs have, to a good extent, uncovered the footprint
of evolution in protein structures that interact with small molecules.
In principle, the general approach employed can be used to predict
sites of other types of protein interactions, such as those between
protein and protein or between protein and nucleic acid.

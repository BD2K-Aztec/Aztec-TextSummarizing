Abstract

Motivation: Most methods for reconstructing response networks from high throughput data gener—
ate static models which cannot distinguish between early and late response stages.

Results: We present TimePath, a new method that integrates time series and static datasets to re—
construct dynamic models of host response to stimulus. TimePath uses an Integer Programming
formulation to select a subset of pathways that, together, explain the observed dynamic responses.
Applying TimePath to study human response to HIV—1 led to accurate reconstruction of several
known regulatory and signaling pathways and to novel mechanistic insights. We experimentally
validated several of TimePaths’ predictions highlighting the usefulness of temporal models.

1 Introduction

High throughput data measuring various aspects of several biolo—
gical systems is rapidly accumulating. These include RNA—Seq stud—
ies (Mortazavi et 61]., 2008), profiling of microRNAs (Vergoulis
et 61]., 2012), ChIP—Seq, epigenetics studies (Gifford et 61]., 2013), in—
formation about protein interactions within a cell (Prasad et 61].,
2009) and information on interactions between host proteins and
pathogen/environmental factors (Navratil et 61]., 2009). Such data—
sets provide extensive information about the sets of genes that are
activated, their regulation and their interactions both within a cell
and between cellular proteins and the environment or pathogen.
However, integrating these datasets to reconstruct a unified view of
the networks and pathways that are activated in order to identify
potential interventions that may lead to a desired response remains a
major challenge.

Several methods have been proposed to integrate various biolo—
gical datasets for this task (Huang et 61]., 2009). However, the vast
majority of these methods are aimed at obtaining static networks
that do not provide temporal information making it hard to deter—
mine the various stages associated with the system being studied (for
example, waves of expression changes (Chang et 61]., 2013)) or the
optimal time to apply an intervention. Consider the HIV—1 infection.

While the development of highly active antiretroviral therapy has
made it possible to delay the progression of HIV infection, the per-
sistence of the virus, rapid development of resistance and inability to
completely eliminate the virus still pose major challenges for effect—
ive HIV—1 management (Shytaj and Savarino, 2013). HIV—1 infects a
host cell by a sequential process involving several temporal events.
These start with binding of the viral envelope protein to the host cell
receptor followed by reverse transcription and integration of pro-
viral DNA (early infection stage). Next, viral proteins are produced
facilitating viral replication (intermediate stage). Finally, new viruses
are released (late stage). While several studies have experimentally
quantified the large scale changes and host—pathogen interactions
for HIV-1 infection (Salgado et 61]., 2011), to date no models exist to
fully link these high throughput temporal datasets with the underly—
ing dynamic networks that lead to the observed responses.

A small number of methods have been proposed for reconstruct—
ing dynamic interaction networks from high throughput data. These
methods utilize the (relatively small number of) time series datasets
to determine temporal information for the (mostly) static interaction
datasets either directly (by projecting the time series data on the
known interaction networks (de Lichtenberg et 61]., 2005)) or indir—
ectly (by looking at targets of transcription factors (TFs) and

associating temporal information for the interactions based on these
targets (Ernst et al., 2007; Schulz et al., 2012). Since gene expression
is the primary source of time series data these methods use, they
have primarily focused on the reconstruction of regulatory networks
(Bar—Joseph et al., 2012). Signaling networks proved to be more
challenging since much of the activity in these networks is post tran—
scriptional (Filipowicz et al., 2008) and often faster than regulatory
networks which made it hard to use time series gene expression data
to obtain temporal information about the activity of these networks.

Several other methods have been developed and evaluated for re—
constructing regulatory networks using gene expression data (Haury
et al., 2012; Marbach et al., 2012; Margolin et al., 2006; Toepfer
et al., 2007). These methods utilize expression levels to determine
regulatory interactions based on various statistical techniques
including correlation, mutual information, regression, etc. While
such methods can be successfully applied in some cases, they are less
appropriate for modeling immune response dynamics since they can—
not model post—transcriptional events (including the effects of virus—
host and protein—protein interactions) which, as we show, play a
major role in such responses.

To address these issues, two new methods have been proposed
recently to jointly reconstruct dynamic signaling and regulatory net—
works by integrating static and time series data. SDREM (Gitter
et al., 2011) relies on a method for orienting protein interaction net-
works which are then combined with TFs and the networks they
regulate using a separate input—output hidden Markov model
(IOHMM). While SDREM has been successfully applied to study
yeast and human response networks (Gitter and Bar—Joseph, 2013;
Gitter et al., 2013; Jain et al., 2014) it does not provide temporal in-
formation about the pathways it finds. In SDREM, all pathways
from source proteins (protein interacting with the environment/
pathogen) to TFs are assumed to be activated concurrently which
does not explain expression waves and response phases. Further,
SDREM does not optimize a single target function but rather two,
separate, functions for different models (one for the IOHMM and
the other for the combinatorial orientation algorithm) making it
hard to determine optimal parameters for the networks. TimeXnet
(Patil et al., 2013) is another method for reconstructing such net—
works. It uses linear programming to formulate a max-flow problem
imposing a constraint that the ﬂow through expressed genes has to
be greater than 0 so that they are accounted for in the networks
identified. TimeXnet has been applied to study immune response in
mice. However, TimeXnet does not directly consider the (often
post—transcriptionally activated) source of the resulting response
which may lead to missing important pathways. In addition,
TimeXnet does not explain why some genes are activated early
while others are only activated at a later stage.

Here, we present TimePath, a new method for reconstructing
fully dynamic signaling and regulatory networks. TimePath uses a
single Integer Programming (IP) based optimization function to
jointly construct the networks. We initially select a large set of path—
ways that are rooted in source proteins and end in differentially
expressed (DE) genes. This allows us to include sources that are only
post—transcriptionally and/or post—translationally activated.
Pathways for later DE genes are required to contain DE genes or
miRNAs from earlier phases to explain their delayed response.
Next, we use the IP to select a small subset of pathways that, to—
gether, explain the full set of DE genes. These selected pathways are
analyzed to determine phase specific proteins and miRNAs and se—
lect those that are key to the response observed.

We applied TimePath to reconstruct dynamic models for HIV-1
immune response. As we show, the method accurately reconstructed

the response networks identifying several known and novel path—
ways. We have performed experiments based on novel predictions
made by TimePath several of which validated the ability of
TimePath to determine a specific time for targeting a protein in
order to reduce viral loads.

2 Methods

2.1 Cell culture, HIV infection and reagents

Sup—T1 cell lines were obtained through the NIH AIDS Research
and Reference Reagent Program, Division of AIDS, NIAID, NIH (A
Sup-T1 from Dr. James Hoxie (Smith et al., 2008) and were main—
tained in RPMI containing 10% FBS, 1% L-glutamine and 1% peni-
cillin streptomycin (GIBCO). HIV—wt—EGFP reporter virus was
obtained by transfecting HEK293 T cells (2 X 106 per plate) with
10 ug of HIV-1 vpr(—I—)/EGFP proviral construct by Polyjet following
manufacturers protocol. Forty—eight hours post transfection, the
supernatants were collected, filtered through a 0.4—um filter to re-
move cellular debris, and centrifuged at 22 000 rpm for 1h. The
virus pellets were resuspended in PBS and stored in aliquots at 80 0C
for subsequent assays. Multiplicity of infection (MOI) for virus was
calculated by TZM blue assay using the HIV—1 reporter cell line
cMAGI (AIDS Research and Reference Reagent Program [RRRP],
National Institutes of Health [NIH]). The Sup—T1 cells were infected
at a MOI of 0.3 either in the presence or absence of specific inhibitor
at indicated time points. Forty hours post infection, the cells were
washed and fixed with 1% paraformaldehyde and the samples were
analyzed using Fortessa (BD Biosciences) with 10 000 gated events
acquired for each sample, and the results were analyzed using
FlowJo software (Tree Star, Inc., OR). The infected cells were de—
tected by the expression of reporter virus EGFP. Azidothymidine
(AZT) obtained from Sigma—Aldrich was used as positive control.
IKK2 inhibitor V, Dasatinib and Dinaciclib were obtained from
CalBiochem. SP600125 and WP 1066 were obtained from Abcam
Biochemicals and Enzo, respectively. SNS—032, Regorafenib,
Carfilzomib and Veliparib, Olaparib were obtained from selleck—
chem.com. SAHA and 5—Azacytidine were obtained from Sigma—
Aldrich. The viability of cells was estimated by Trypan blue staining.
We conducted the experiments three times with duplicate wells for
each experiment.

2.2 Data description

The overall goal of TimePath is to determine the dynamics of both
the signaling and the regulatory events that take place as part of a
cellular response process. For this, TimePath integrates time series
gene expression data, static protein interaction data (both within
and across species) and protein—DNA interaction data. We con—
structed a weighted, partially directed, protein interaction network
using several databases including BIOGRID (Stark et al., 2006),
HPRD (Prasad et al., 2009) and have also used Post—translational
Modification Annotations from the HPRD. Protein—DNA inter-
actions are based on data from (Schulz et al., 2012). Sources (host
proteins that interact with the HIV—1 proteins) were obtained from
VirHostNet (Navratil et al., 2009). Time series gene expression and
miRNA expression data following HIV-1 infection in Sup—T1 was
obtained from (Mohammadi et al., 2013). See Supplementary
Methods for complete details.

2.3 Candidate pathways
To reconstruct the dynamic set of signaling pathways that are acti—
vated we first divide the time series gene expression data into K

112 /§JO'S{Bu1no [p.IOJXO'SOIlBIHJOJUIOICI/ﬁdllq 11101; popeopimoq

TimePath

 

phases. Initial response is likely driven by host proteins that interact
directly with virus proteins. However, later changes in expression
data (for example, expression changes that only occur 10 h after in-
fection) are likely driven by genes or TFs that have been activated
as part of an earlier expression response. In general we assume
that expression changes in phase 1' can be partially explained by acti—
vation/repression of a gene(s) in phase 1' — 1. To guarantee that our
reconstructed pathways satisfy this we impose the constraint
that any pathway that explains differential gene expression for a
gene in phase i> 1 has to include at least one gene that was DE in
phase 1' — 1.

Based on these assumptions we initially select a subset of path—
ways that can be used to explain the DE genes as follows:

1. We divide the time series into [2 phases each consisting of T/k
time points where T is the total number of points. We use [a = 3
for this paper.

2. We extract the top N1 DE genes for each phase (we use
N1 : 200). How the signiﬁcantly DE genes are extracted and
ranked is explained in Supplementary Methods.

3. We then search for the highest scoring N2 acyclic paths from the
source proteins (host proteins interacting with the virus of drug)
to the targets (DE genes) for each phase (we use N2: 10 million
here). We use the edge weights to compute a score for each path
(Supplementary Methods). We also guarantee that the following
constraints are satisﬁed for each pathway:

a. The last edge in the path has to be a protein—DNA inter-
action (i.e. we need a TF to activate/repress the gene) (Yeang
et al., 2004).

b. A path to a phase 1' > 1 target has to contain a node that is a
target for phase 1' — 1.

In general, searching for the top N2 acyclic paths in a graph is a
#P—complete problem which is not considered to be solvable effi—
ciently (Arora and Barak, 2009). We thus use a heuristic to compute
the set of paths. See Supporting Methods for a detailed description
of the above process.

2.4 Integer program to select subset of pathways
Given a set of top paths for each target, our next goal is to combine
them to identify the actual pathways that are activated as part of the
response. Consider two targets g1 and g2 in phase [a that are known
to be bound by the same TF A. If we believe that A explains the acti—
vation of g1 in that phase it increases our belief that A is also the TF
activating g2. More generally, our goal is to select a subset of these
pathways that, together, would minimize the number of intermedi-
ate signaling and regulatory proteins that are used across all path—
ways while at the same time maximize the number of targets that
can be explained.

To accomplish this we define a new Integer Programming (IP)
problem which includes three sets of binary variables (bv)

1. bv for a path to indicate whether it is selected or not.
bv for a target to indicate whether there is at least one path end—
ing at it.

3. bv for protein to determine whether it is part of a path selected.

Using these variables we maximize the following objective

where K is the number of phases, Tk is the targets for phase 12, P is
the set of all paths, G is the set of all genes, P(:, g) is the set of paths
ending at gene g, w(p) is the weight of path [9. The score of each a
pathway [J is defined as HeeEpIP(e) where Ep is the set of edges in
pathway [J and IP(e) is the edge score which is defined in
Supplementary Methods, b; is whether path p is selected or not, fg is
whether gene g has even one selected path ending at it, [9; is whether
gene g is selected, 214 are the weights for balancing the minimiza-
tion requirements in terms of intermediate nodes and the maximiza—
tion requirements in terms of the number of targets. They are the
parameters that decide in the end, how large of a network in terms
of number of genes and edges will be chosen.

Note that setting [9; = 0 for a specific gene immediately implies
that b; for a path containing that gene is 0 and similarly that fg is 0
for that gene and so these variables are not independent as the con—
straints above imply. We set b5 : 1 if and only if all the genes in the
path are selected as enforced by constraints 1—2. fg is 1 if and only if
there’s at least one path with b; = 1 ending at the gene g as enforced
by constraint 3.

Since this is a problem with linear constraints, a linear objective
and since the bg variables are binary, this is an IP and not an Linear
Program (LP). The IP we are dealing with however is too large for
standard IP solvers and we thus solve it using a greedy approach fol—
lowed by a tabu search heuristic to escape local minimum. Briefly,
we start with all the nodes selected. Then at each step, we search for
a node whose addition or removal from network would increase the
objective the most (this is accomplished by ﬂipping the bn variable
for that gene). Paths that contain a gene that is not in the current
network are removed (i.e. their corresponding bp variable is 0).
Once we find such a node, we add or remove it and keep going until
we can find no node whose addition or removal will improve the ob—
jective. We randomly select nodes if there are ties between them.
Thus the results can differ from one run to another—however, the
actual genes selected by the network change little according to our
experimental results. See Supplementary Results for details.

2.5 Ranking genes

After solving the IP we obtain a subset of the pathways that, com—
bined, explain the observed expression response over time. While
we attempt to minimize the number of proteins in these networks,
we still end up with hundreds of proteins in the set of selected path—
ways. To identify key proteins for follow up analysis, we rank genes
for each phase based on the ‘path ﬂow’ going through them. The
path ﬂow f through a node n for phase 1' is defined as follows.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 TimePath analysis of expression and

interaction data

To identify the dynamic pathways that are activated by biological
response processes, TimePath uses the time series gene expression to
annotate the static protein—protein and protein—DNA interaction
data (Fig. 1). This is achieved by formulating an Integer
Programming (IP) optimization function that balances the ability to
explain the DE genes at different time points with the requirement
that relatively few of all possible pathways are used in each of the
different responses. Following the application of IP to our modeling
problem we obtain a sparse set of pathways, each associated with a
specific experimental phase (or subset of time points), that together
explain the expression profiles observed as part of the response.
Each of these pathways is rooted at a source protein (a protein that
directly interacts with the infecting agent or with the environment)
allowing us to link the expression observed to its causes. In addition,
to explain the different expression waves we require that pathways
leading to genes that are DE at later time points contain at least one
gene that is DE at an earlier time point. The complete set of path—
ways obtained by TimePath is then analyzed to identify key proteins
and determine potential interventions that can block the response
observed (Section 2).

3.2 TimePath analysis of HIV data

We used TimePath to examine cell response to HIV infection. Time
series expression data for HIV—1 was obtained from Mohammadi
et al. (2013) which profiled genes using SAGEseq every 2 h for 24 h
after transfection with HIV—1 in Sup—T1 cell line. Expression data
was normalized using DESeq (Anders and Huber, 2010). In addition
to HIV expression data we obtained interaction data for HIV—1 pro—
teins and host (human) proteins from VirHostNet (Navratil et al.,

Fig. 1. Overview of TimePath. (Left) Several time series and static datasets
are used as input. (Top right) Based on these inputs an initial set of pathways
is selected such that each starts at a source (a host protein interacting with a
virus protein), ends in a target (a DE gene for one of the time points) and con-
tains PPI and Protein—DNA edges. (Middle right) Next, Integer Programming
(IP) is performed to select a subset of these pathways. (Bottom right) The re-
sulting pathways explain the dynamics of the observed response including
the different expression phases observed for different genes

2009). Of the 235 proteins in VirHostNet, 231 are present in our
protein—protein interaction (ppi) network and were used as potential
sources.

TimePath also uses general protein—protein interactions from
BIOGRID (Stark et al., 2006) and HPRD (Prasad et al., 2009), Post—
translational Modification Annotations from HPRD and Protein—
DNA interaction data (Schulz et al., 2012) (Section 2).

To identify pathways for specific response phases we divided the
time series expression into 3 phases (every 8h) and extracted 200
targets (DE genes) for each phase (Section 2). We next used the static
interaction data to identify a large number of potential pathways
connecting sources and targets constraining potential pathways for
later targets to contain a gene that is DE at an earlier phase. A subset
of these pathways that, together, explain the observed response to
HIV infection are then selected by the IP method. Pathways retained
by the IP for this data included a total of 607 genes of which 319 are
targets. We next ranked proteins in these pathways based on their
importance to each phase (Section 2).

3.3 Pathways and proteins identified for HIV response
The resulting dynamic network is presented in Figure 2. Top ranked
proteins for each of the three phases are presented in Table 1 and
Supplementary Tables 81—83.

The dynamics observed by TimePath provide important insights
into the mechanisms used by the HIV—1 to proliferate and overcome
host defenses. Several of the proteins identified as controlling the
early phase response are related pathways that either promote viral
replication (e.g. P53) or suppress immune response pathways (e.g.
AP1B1, AP2B1, CALM3) are known to be key participants in HIV
pathways (Greenway et al., 2002). Several of the signaling proteins
and TFs controlling the later phases in the reconstructed TimePath
model are also related to promotion of virus activity. These include
proteins controlling virus elongation (GTF2H1), down regulated
proteins for cell cycle arrest (CDC34, LCK (Strasner et al., 2008))
and several down regulated proteins that are involved in immune re-
sponse (PTPN7, VAV1) and superinfection prevention (ACTB).
However, later phases of the model also contain proteins that are
part of the host defense response (much more than phase 1). These
include immune response factors such as STAT and JUN (Phase 2)
(Mak and Saunders, 2006) and the down regulation of apoptosis in—
hibitors (e.g. DDIT3. Thus, while the network reveals the strategy
utilized by the virus to circumvent initial innate immune response, it
also identifies the key factors of the cellular response networks that
escape viral regulation and are utilize by the cell to respond to the
infection. See Supplementary Tables 88—810, Supplementary Results
and Discussion below for more details.

3.4 Statistical validation of the reconstructed network
and comparison with other methods

To more globally assess the ability of TimePath to accurately iden—
tify pathways and proteins, and to compare its performance with
prior methods that were developed to reconstruct dynamic signaling
and regulatory networks we used several complementary datasets to
test the reconstructed pathways.

While several methods have been proposed for reconstructing
biological networks [28], relatively few are focused on analyzing dy—
namic response networks. These include SDREM (Gitter and Bar—
]oseph, 2013; Gitter et al., 2011), which combines a HMM method
for modeling dynamic regulatory networks with a combinatorial al—
gorithm for signaling network reconstruction and TimeXnet (Patil
et al., 2013) which uses a linear programming (LP) formulation to

Fig. 2. Dynamic signaling and regulatory network for HIV-1 immune response. The red nodes are the host proteins that interact with the HIV-1 proteins (selected
sources). Blue nodes are intermediate signaling proteins and green nodes are the TFs that are predicted to directly up/down-regulate the differential expression

of target genes (targets not shown in figure, but the average levels of the regulated targets for each TF is presented by the yellow nodes while the size of each of
the yellow nodes indicates how many genes belong to the cluster represented by the node). The figure displays the top predicted nodes for each of the three
phases and also demonstrates is directly linked to the sources via the signaling proteins and DE genes in earlier phases. Diamond shaped nodes were identified

as supported RNAi screen hits (text) and rectangular nodes are targets for the phase they are in. Nodes with bold blue border represent proteins we experimen-
tally tested. Note that some intermediate proteins may also be TF5. The functional role in the network figure is based on the location of the protein in the selected

paths based on the IP

find important genes. Note that neither of these methods uses
miRNA expression data and so we constrained our comparison to
TimePath models that do not utilize such data (models using
miRNA expression data are discussed in Section 3.6).

In addition to comparing TimePath with prior methods that con-
struct both signaling and regulatory networks, we have also com-
pared the top ranked genes from TimePath to the top DE genes in
the dataset (Supporting Methods) since several methods for analyz-
ing gene expression data still focus on such DE genes (Rapaport
et al., 2013).

3.4.1 RNAi screen hits

First, we looked at RNAi screen experiments which test the impact
of gene knockdown on HIV viral load. Three such experiments were
conducted though a meta-analysis of the results determined that
only three proteins were detected by all studies (Bushman et al.,
2009). We have filtered the combined list to select a subset of the
hits that are supported by at least two lines of evidence
(Supplementary Results) resulting in 389 supported hits, 364 of
which were present in our initial network.

The results are in Table 2. We find that the pathways obtained
by TimePath are significantly enriched for screen hits (P-value of
1.7 x 10‘”). This significant overlap also holds separately for each
the subset of proteins identified for the three phases (Supplementary
Tables 51—53). We next compared these results to results from the
other two network reconstruction methods and to the top DE genes.
For this comparison we ranked the genes using path flow for
TimePath and SDREM (Section 2) and used the TimeXnet output
ranking for that method. The RNAi overlap is presented in Tables 2.
As can be seen, rankings for all network reconstruction methods
greatly outperforms the DE genes rankings highlighting the

importance of post-transcriptional and post-translational events in
the response process. Further, both TimePath and SDREM signifi-
cantly outperform TimeXnet in this analysis with almost a quarter
of the top ranked genes supported by screen hits.

3.4.2 Analysis using GO and Reactome
To further analyze the pathways identified by TimePath we looked
at the agreement between them and two complementary databases:
The Gene Ontology (GO) and the set of HIV curated pathways in
Reactome. GO analysis was performed on the top 100 genes (nodes)
identified based on the path ﬂow metric (Section 2) using
FuncAssociate (Berriz et al., 2003) while Reactome analysis was per-
formed using the set of pathway edges. The results indicate that the
pathways obtained by TimePath agree very well with known path-
ways involved in HIV response. The full list of enriched GO catego-
ries (corrected P-value g 0.001) is presented on the Supporting
Website and includes ‘toll-like receptor signaling pathway’, an im-
portant component of innate immune response (Mak and Saunders,
2006), ‘positive regulation of defense response’, ‘innate immune
response-activating signal transduction’, etc. We also find that
TimePath achieves a higher number and a higher percentage of sig-
nificantly enriched immune related categories compared to SDREM
and TimeXnet 4 using the FuncAssociate (Berriz et al., 2003) tool.
We compared the % of significantly enriched GO categories that
were immune response related (Supporting Methods). TimePath
again has a both a slightly higher number and a higher percentage of
significantly enriched immune related categories compared to
SDREM and TimeXnet (Table 4).

Results for Reactome are presented in Table 2, Supplementary

R1/2/3 indicates the rank of the gene in phase 1/2/3. If the rank is ‘NP’,
that means the gene was not found to be present in the phase. Genes tested ex-
perimentally are colored red (see Supplementary Tables 81—83 for complete
rankings). For later phases we focused on genes that were ranked high for
these phases compared to their rank in an earlier phase. Genes with absolute
log fold change expression <2 are designated as not being differential
expressed.

present in the HIV Reactome pathways. Comparison with the other
methods clearly demonstrates the advantages of TimePath which is
able to identify a much larger number of correct interactions than
the other two network reconstruction methods. Note that Reactome
comparison is not available for the DE gene list since it does not con—
tain interactions.

We have also analyzed the usefulness of the various stages of
TimePath. As can be seen in Table 3, each step in the TimePath
method further improves the overlap with the screen hits. Initially,
only 3.7% of the expressed genes are screen hits. The initial path-
way extraction step increases the overlap to 10% while the overlap
following IP increases to 14%.

Finally, we investigated the impact of the constraint imposed on
later paths in our network to include a DE gene from an earlier
phase. As we show in Table 5, we obtain almost three times as many
edges in the overlap compared to the network without the time con—
straint with correspondingly better P—value.

‘Pre-algorithm’ is the initial overlap for all genes in the network.
‘Unexpressed genes ﬁltered’ is when we remove all genes from our interaction
network that are unexpressed. ‘After pathway search’ is that stage that uses
all genes included in the initial top scoring set of pathways. ‘After IP’ is the
ﬁnal stage after the IP (and thus the whole algorithm) has run. As can be seen,
the IP step seems to further improve the resulting set of genes indicating that
the selection process indeed identiﬁes HIV response pathways.

3.5 Experimental results

To experimentally test the temporal predictions of TimePath we se—
lected top ranking phase proteins for which we could obtain com—
mercial inhibitors and examined the impact of blocking these
proteins at various time points in the response (Fig. 3). Note that the
RNAi knockdown screens discussed above were performed on a dif—
ferent cell type (Hela/TZM—bl and 293T) and so, while they are use—
ful for statistical validation, they may not completely reflect
pathways activated in Sup—T1 cells. More importantly, these screens

do not provide information about the dynamics of the response
while our experiments are aimed at testing not just the predictions
regarding top ranked proteins but also their phase specific assign—
ment. We performed experiments in which we varied the time of
applying the inhibitors w.r.t the infection time. For each of the pro—
teins tested, inhibitors were applied 2 h prior to infection (phase 1),
4 h (phase 2) and 14 h (phase 3) post infection. Amount of infection
was determined at 40 h post infection for all experiments. We con—
currently measured cell viability to test the toxicity of the inhibitor
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

The results are presented in Figure 3. As can be seen, for five of
the inhibitors we tested (targeting 11 of the 22 proteins tested) we
observed a significant impact on viral load as predicted by
TimePath. Note that the screen results indicate that less than 1.5%
of all proteins lead to decreased viral load, and so such a high valid—
ation rate is a strong indication for the accuracy of TimePath.
Importantly, several of the time specific predictions were validated
in these experiments. We expected that inhibiting proteins that are
ranked at the top for all phases or for phase 3, at any time, would
lead to reduction in viral load since even early inhibition prevents
them from being activated at a later stage. We indeed see this effect
for the STAT inhibition (ranked in the top 30 for all phases) and for
PSMA4 (ranked at the top only for phase 3). In contrast, for proteins
ranked high in phase 1 and lower at the next phases we expected to
see a much greater impact for the early treatment vs. later ones since
their impact may have already been exerted by the time of the later
treatments. This is exactly what we see for two of these proteins.
For both NFKB1 (ranked 14 in the first phase but dropping to 50 in
the 2nd) and for Raf1 (dropping from 28 to 66) we see significant
response when treated early but a much lower impact on viral load
when treated at later stages strongly supporting TimePath’s predic-
tions. Published studies suggest that NF—kB has a major role in HIV-
1 transcription due to it is binding sites in HIV-1 LTR and
TAR-RNA (Kwon et al., 1998; Takada et al., 2002; Tareq Hassan
Khan et al., 2012; Williams et al., 2007; Wires et al., 2012). Results
from our analyses predicted a role for NF—kB during the early phase
(phase 1) and blocking this TF inhibited virus replication only in
pretreatment (2 h) and did not affect virus replication when treated
at the later stages and this effect is independent of cellular toxicity.

Similarly, another protein Raf1, predicted as early phase response to
HIV—1 also exhibited similar phase dependent inhibition. Though
Raf1 is known to interact with HIV—1 Nef and perturb T cell signal—
ing and activation pathway (Hodge et al., 1998), the mechanisms by
which Raf1 exerts its effects is unclear. It is possible to predict that
blocking Raf1 might have an effect on the function of HIV-1 early
protein Nef, thus altering T cell signaling and virus infection.
Another phase 1 protein, CDK2 (dropping from 29 to 59) also
showed strong impact when treated at the early time point but un—
like the other phase 1 predictions, later treatments continued to
have a significant impact on viral loads. CDK is known to play a
role in HIV-1 transcription by the viral transactivator, Tat (Cujec
et al., 1997), thus there is a direct correlation predicted by
TimePath. However, blocking CDK using inhibitors blocked both at
the early and late phase suggest that these inhibitors might have dir-
ect and indirect effect on virus replication.

PSMA41 is part of the proteasomal complex and so inhibiting this
protein with Carﬁlzomib not only blocks the proteasomal pathway, but
could also alter additional cellular processes such as sumoylation, ubiqui—
tination and Cull activity. These results are further supported by the early
time points predictions that identiﬁed SUMOl, UBE2I and CUL1 in
Phase 1. Sumoylation of HIV—1 integrase is essential for efﬁcient viral rep—
lication (Zamborlini et al., 2011) and cullin ligases are recruited by HIV—
1 viral proteins to overcome host viral restriction factors, HIV—1 Vif de—
grades APOBEC proteins (Goila—Gaur et al., 2008) and HIV—1 Vpr in—
duces degradation of UNG and SMUG uracil—DNA glycosylases
(Schrofelbauer et al., 2005). Also HIV—1 Vpr is known to interact with
damaged DNA binding protein 1 (DDB1) to induce G2/M arrest which
contributes to efﬁcient viral replication (Hakata et al., 2014). Indeed,
many of the factors predicted for the early stage response (Phase 1: 0—8 h)
are related to DNA modiﬁcation and chromatin remodeling (HDAC1,
HDAC2, DNMT1, KAT2B) and cell cycle (CTNNB1, CSNK2A1,
CDK2, E2F1). Also there is an enrichment of transcription factors (P53,
RELA, NFKB1, NR3C1, Stat1, MYC, RAF1, TBP, YY1), which have
binding sites on HIV—1 LTR. These factors may have a role in integration
of proviral DNA and regulation of HIV—1 transcription.

3.5.1 The role of late activated pathways

A key advantage of TimePath is its ability to highlight key pathways
that are only activated later in the response. As we show in
Supplementary Results and in Supplementary Table S12 some of
these pathways also support the ability of the virus to promote its
replication and dissemination by facilitating elongation of viral tran-
scripts, preventing reinfection, promoting survival of infected cells
and by immune evasion. Previous results have shown that viral pro—
teins Nef, Env and Vpu modulate the surface expression of critical
immune molecules such as CD4, CD28, MHC class I and others
through protein—protein interaction (Haller et al., 2014). Our results
show that the virus can also regulate the expression levels of CD4,
AP1 subunits and other related genes. This suggests that the virus
has additional mechanisms to prevent super infection. However,
later phase regulators identified by TimePath also contain several
proteins related to host defense mechanisms which are activated to
suppress virus infection (Supplementary Table S12). Similar to the
pathways discussed above, which were ranked based on the network
scoring technique (Section 2), when we classified the expression
changes of individual genes we observed that the majority of the
changes that occur during early stages tend to facilitate virus infec—
tion, whereas the host defense responses are observed largely at the
later phases. Though multiple HIV—1 repressor genes are down regu—
lated early on, there are certain TF genes, including TP5 3, RELA,
NR3C1 which can bind sites on HIV LTR, that are also repressed.

This suggests that the virus has evolved ways to differentially regu—
late specific TFs to enhance virus production while at the same time
trying to prevent a boost to the immune response, as many of these
TFs are also binding in front of immune response genes. The dy—
namic network also explains how genes that are differentially regu—
lated at later stages of virus infection (Supplementary Table S12)
result from changes observed in earlier Phases. TimePath analysis
underlines the temporal relation of the well—established ability of
virus to exploit the host machinery.

3.6 Incorporating miRNAs to TimePath models

Similar to TFs, miRNAs have also been shown to regulate the ex—
pression of mRNAs. In most cases the effects of this regulation is in—
hibitory including interference with translation (Alberts et al.,
2007), and binding to mRNAs to expedite their degradation
(Eulalio et al., 2009). We can easily extend TimePath to include
miRNAs by incorporating into the analysis pipeline two new types
of edges: (i) Edges representing interactions between from miRNAs
and their targets and (ii) edges representing the regulation of
miRNAs themselves by TFs (Wang et al., 2010). To determine the
set of edges we used the TargetScan database (Grimson et al., 2007)
and ENCODE data (Section 2). Using these new edges miRNAs can
be treated as any other node (genes) in our model with two excep—
tions: (i) Unlike TFs, which can be post—transcriptionally regulated,
miRNAs are only regulated transcriptionally and so we only include
a miRNA in our model if it is DE in at least one of the phases and
(ii) We require that gene targets of miRNAs be anti—correlated with
the expression of the miRNA regulating them (to model the inhibi-
tory impact). See Supplementary Methods for details.

The miRNA genome locations were taken from minase
(Griffiths—Jones et al., 2006), release 20 which consists of 4446
miRNAs, 499 of which are present in the RNA—seq expression data—
set we used. The raw sequence counts of the miRNAs are given in
the expression dataset for the same timepoints as the genes and are
normalized in the same fashion as the gene expression counts are.
We re—ran TimePath using these modifications and the additional
miRNA expression data. As can be seen in Supplementary Figure
S2, the resulting network contained most of the proteins/genes that
were included in the original network for the different phases.
However, the network also identified a number of miRNAs as con-
trolling the expression of phase 1 gene expression. Specifically, of
the 499 miRNAs we analyzed 16 were selected for the final network
(5 are shown in Supplementary Figure S2).

To determine the relevance of the selected miRNAs, we eval—
uated the list by using Ingenuity pathway analysis (2015)
(Supporting Methods). Five of the 17 validated HIV miRNAs in
Ingenuity were within the group of 16 miRNAs selected by
TimePath which is almost 10 times more than expected by random
chance (P—value 8.5 X 10_5 ). The full list of 16 is presented in
Supplementary Table S13. These include miR—148a which was
shown to significantly control the HIV virus via its regulation of
HLA-C expression (Kulkarni et al., 2011, 2013), miR-27a and miR-
27b which are part of a class of miRNAs that have been found to af—
fect HIV infection (Chiang et al., 2012) and miR-214 which is
known to exhibit broad antiviral activity (Hayes et al., 201 1).

4 Discussion

Since most of the high throughput data used to reconstruct cellular
response networks is static, current models based on these data are
often unable to provide specific temporal hypotheses regarding the

effects of perturbations and drugs on cellular responses. Here, we
formulated a new Integer Programming (IP) optimization function
to connect observed temporal responses (from gene expression data)
with the underlying sources, to further identify the pathways and
transcription factors that activate them. We then use the pathways
and their predicted time to reconstruct the full response network
leading to insights regarding the propagation of cellular responses,
key proteins controlling the responses and testable hypothesis re—
garding the effects of perturbing proteins at various time points fol—
lowing infection.

Applying TimePath to model HIV response networks led to the
identification of known and novel proteins and miRNAs for the
HIV response pathways. The reconstructed network explains the
roles of several HIV screen hits, the function of TFs and miRNA
controlling expression levels and is enriched for functional catego—
ries related to immune and viral responses.

The pathways identified can be divided to those induced by the
virus to promote survival/replication and those induced by the host
to curtail virus infection and promote cellular survival. Our tem—
poral regulatory model indicates that these can also be divided based
on their dynamics.

Follow up experiments using inhibitors conﬁrmed the prediction
of TimePath, where 11 of the 22 predicted proteins (that were eval—
uated in the experiment) were identified to have a role in HIV infec-
tion. NFKB and related genes are exclusively essential for virus
infection in the initial phase as predicted by TimePath, similarly,
RAF1 was also confirmed to have an important role in the initial
phase. As predicted by TimePath, these genes may either be required
for virus infection during the initial phase, or the changes triggered by
these genes in the initial phase can temporally affect downstream
events that are essential for virus infection. It is also noted that CDKs,
STATs and proteasomal machinery are essential during all phases of
HIV infection, and TimePath had predicted a role for these genes
starting with phase 1 (CDKs) and/or a combination of phases—phase
1 and phase 2 (STATs) or phase 3 (proteasomal machinery and
related processes). Though TimePath identifies the role for these genes
or processes in specific phase, it suggests that the event occurs at the
identified phase; however, it does not rule out that the events are con—
tinuing over time and have a role in later stages too.

Unlike other methods that attempt to link treatments to disease
stages (for example, in cancer which uses pathological analysis to
determine tumor grades) TimePath is fully based on the molecular
data, thus could be applied to much shorter time scales. This ap—
proach enables the programme to obtain a more fine resolution of
the disease stage, which cannot be observed by other methods. With
higher resolution, it may be possible to use TimePath to tailor ap—
propriate treatment options to treat infected individuals.

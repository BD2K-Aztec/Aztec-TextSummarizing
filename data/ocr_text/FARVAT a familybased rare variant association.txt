ABSTRACT

Motivation: Individuals in each family are genetically more homoge-
neous than unrelated individuals, and family-based designs are often
recommended for the analysis of rare variants. However, despite the
importance of family-based samples analysis, few statistical methods
for rare variant association analysis are available.

Results: In this report, we propose a FAmily-based Rare Variant
Association Test (FARVAT). FARVAT is based on the quasi-likelihood
of whole families, and is statistically and computationally efficient for
the extended families. FARVAT assumed that families were ascer-
tained with the disease status of family members, and incorporation
of the estimated genetic relationship matrix to the proposed method
provided robustness under the presence of the population substruc-
ture. Depending on the choice of working matrix, our method could be
a burden test or a variance component test, and could be extended to
the SKAT-O-type statistic. FARVAT was implemented in C+ +, and
application of the proposed method to schizophrenia data and simu-
lated data for GAW17 illustrated its practical importance.

lysis of related samples, and it is freely downloadable from http://

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in genotyping technology have enabled researchers to
conduct large-scale genetic analyses, and during the last decade,
genome-wide association studies have identified >1000 common
genetic loci associated with many phenotypes. However, herit-
abilities for most phenotypes are only partially explained by
these signiﬁcant findings (Manolio et al., 2009), and relatively
small proportions of variance explained by common variants

have revealed the importance of association analyses with rare
variants (Yang et al., 2011).

Contrary to the analysis of common variants, single genetic
association analysis with rare variants is often associated with
large false-negative results unless sample sizes or effect sizes are
very large. Thus, association analysis with the collapsed genotype
scores for a set of rare variants has been suggested (Li and Leal,
2008). For instance, minor alleles for all rare variants in a gene or
a region are counted, and the disease status is regressed on minor
allele counts (MAC). Alternatively, the collapsed amount of vari-
ance inﬂation for rare variants can be compared between affected
and unaffected individuals (Neale et al., 2011; Wu et al., 2011).
The former is often called a burden test, while the latter is a
variance component test. The burden test is statistically more
efficient than variance component methods such as C—alpha
(Neale et al., 2011) and SKAT Wu et al., 2011) if most of
the rare alleles have similar effects on the disease. However, if
rare variants with deleterious and protective effects are
combined, the collapsed genotype scores for affected and un-
affected individuals are similar, and genetic association analysis
with a burden test becomes inefficient, whereas the variance
component method become more robust. Both methods can be
combined into robust statistical strategies such as the SKAT-O
approach (Lee et al., 2012a), which is statistically efﬁcient in both
situations.

However, despite these improvements in statistical methods,
the high cost of sequencing still prevents large-scale genome-wide
rare variant association studies. The common disease rare vari-
ant hypothesis assumes genetic heterogeneity between affected
individuals, and selecting genetically homogeneous subjects ob-
viously increases the rate of true-positive findings. In particular,
family members are genetically more homogeneous than random
samples, and rare variant analysis with extended families can
lead to identiﬁcation of more disease-susceptibility variants
(Dering et al., 2011; Manolio et al., 2009). For instance, it has
been shown that the enrichment of rare alleles in 100 affected sib
pairs can be equal to that of 200 cases—control pairs (Shi and
Rao, 2011). Therefore, rare variant association analysis with

carefully ascertained families seems to be an efﬁcient strategy,
and the development of statistical methods for family-based sam-
ples is necessary.

Recently, Family Based Association Tests (FBAT) statistics
(Laird et al., 2000) have been extended for application in rare
variant association analysis: the burden test (De et al., 2013) and
the variance component test (Ionita-Laza et al., 2013) have been
proposed. According to the nature of FBAT, these tests are
robust against the population substructure and can be combined
with rank-based P—values (Van Steen et al., 2005; Won et al.,
2009) based on the between-family component (Lange et al.,
2003). He at a]. (2014) proposed Rare Variant Extensions of
the Transmission Disequilibrium Test (RV-TDT) methods,
which were extensions of the TDT (Spielman et al., 1993).
FBAT and RV—TDT methods were shown to be robust and
powerful for exploration of rare variant association in the popu-
lation substructure. However, even though robustness against
the population substructure can be provided, those approaches
do not take into account the parental phenotypes, and power
loss can be substantial for extended family designs. Alternatively,
studies have proposed the functional principal component ana-
lysis (FPCA) and pedigree-based combined multivariate and col-
lapsing statistic (PedCMC) tests (Zhu and Xiong, 2012), which
are extended Cochran—Armitage tests for family-based samples.
These tests use data from the whole family for rare variant as-
sociation analysis and are expected to be more efﬁcient than
FBAT/TDT-type statistics. However, if the effects of rare vari-
ants are proportional to MAC or the protective and deleterious
variants are mixed in a gene, these approaches can be less
efﬁcient.

In this report, we propose a FAmily-based Rare Variant
Association Test (FARVAT). We provide a burden test and a
variance component test for extended families, and these
approaches are extended to the SKAT-O—type statistic. The pro-
posed method assumes that families are ascertained based on the
disease status of family members, and minor allele frequencies
(MAFs) between affected and unaffected individuals are com-
pared. MAFs for each rare variant are estimated with the best
linear unbiased estimators (McPeek et al., 2004). FARVAT is
implemented with C+ + and is computationally efﬁcient for
the analysis of rare variants with extended families. With exten-
sive simulations, we compared the proposed methods with exist-
ing methods (He at al., 2014; Zhu and Xiong, 2012), and results
showed that the proposed methods were the most efﬁcient in the
considered scenarios. Application of the proposed method to
schizophrenia and GAW17 illustrated its practical value in real
analyses.

2 METHODS

2.1 Notations and the disease model

We assumed that there are 11 families and 11,- individuals in family i, and
the total sample size was denoted by N =Z?=1n,-. We assumed that
genotype data for m rare variant loci were available. We let 32,; and x;
be the phenotype and genotype count of an individual j in a family i for
rare variant k. If we denoted the disease prevalence by q, yij was coded as
l for affected individuals, q for individuals with missing phenotype and 0
for unaffected individuals. If genotype frequencies of affected and

unaffected individuals are compared to detect genetic associations, the
statistical efﬁciency can be improved by modifying the phenotype (Lange
and Laird, 2002; Thornton and McPeek, 2007), and we therefore intro-
duced the so-called offset 11,-]- to set 1,,- : yij — 11,-]. The disease prevalence q
has often been used as an offset, and if the disease prevalences in males
and females are different, the offset should be chosen separately
(Thornton et al., 2012). For randomly selected families, the best linear
unbiased predictor (BLUP) from the linear mixed model is known to be
an efﬁcient choice for 11,-]- (Won and Lange, 2013). With this choice of
offset, the effects of covariates can properly be adjusted. Then, if we set
the column vectors that comprise x; and 1,]- for individuals in a family i by
Xi‘ and T ,-, respectively, we denoted

X’f T1
Xk= 3 , X=(X1 X’"), and T: E . (1)

xk Tn
The variance-covariance matrix of Xk for extended families could be
calculated based on the kinship coefﬁcient. If we let (pg-ff be the kinship
coefﬁcient between individuals j in a family i and j’ in a family i’, and let

d,-J- be the inbreeding coefﬁcient for an individual j in family i, (I),- was
denoted by

and we let

_ . . 0

If we denote the covariance between x; and  by 0W, we have cov(Xk,
X”) = okkrcl), and 0W is estimated with the empirical covariance.

In the presence of population substructure, (I) should be empirically
estimated with common variants available at the genome-wide level in-
stead of using the kinship coefﬁcient between individuals (Thornton and
McPeek, 2010). We assume that there are A common variants, and the
coded genotype for common variant is denoted by x? for individual j in
family i at common variant a. If we let pa be the MAF of common variant
a, (pg-j] for (I) (Thornton and McPeek, 2010) can be estimated by

2.2 FAmily-based Rare Variant Association Test

For ascertained samples, the disease status can be assumed to be ﬁxed,
and the genotype frequencies between affected and unaffected individuals
are usually compared. We let 1,, be the w X 1 column vector that consisted
of l and 1,, be the w X w identity matrix. If we denoted an MAF of rare
variant k in unaffected individuals by pk, we assumed (Thornton and
McPeek, 2007) that for a constant yk,

E(Xk IY) = 217k 1N + M, var (Xk IY) = Ukde (5)

where 0<2pk + yk< 1. If we let V be the working variance-covariance
matrix, the score for the quasi-likelihood (Thornton and McPeek, 2007)
became

T‘V‘1(X — E(X)). (6)

Recently, we showed that the approximate optimal efﬁciency for the
analysis of common variants is achieved with V = IN (Won and Lange,
2013). For the choice of the offset in T, BLUP and q have been suggested
for randomly selected samples and ascertained samples, respectively
(Thornton and McPeek, 2007; Won and Elston, 2008). E(X) can be
estimated with the following best linear unbiased estimator (McPeek
et al., 2004):

E(X) = 1N(1;Vc1>-11N)—11§Vc1>-1x. (7)
Therefore, our score based on the quasi-likelihood became
T’(IN — 1N(1§Vq>-11N)—11§Vc1>-1)x. (8)
If we let
U11 - - - 01m
H=(I) — 1N(1;VcI>-11N)—113V and 2 = 5  5 , (9)
Uml 0mm
we have
var (T’(IN — 1N(1§Vc1>—11N)—11§V<I>—1)xk)= okkT’HT, (10)

and thus the variance-covariance matrix of the score was
var (T’(X1 — E(x1)) T‘(Xm — E(xm)) ) = (T’HT)2. (11)

Therefore, we have

 

1

VT’HT

(12)
For rare variant association analysis, the collapsed amount of either rare
alleles or variance inﬂation between affected and unaffected individuals
has been compared (Li and Leal, 2008; Neale et al., 2011; Price et al.,
2010; Wu et al., 2011). If we let the weight for variant k be wk, the null
hypothesis for the former was

Hézw1y1+...+wmym=0, (13)
and that for the latter was

H3 : w%y%+...+w,2nyi=0. (14)

For the choice of wk, wk = 1 or [pk(1 — pk)]’1/2 are often used. If we

denoted the m X m diagonal matrix, which consists of wk, by W, the
score test for the burden-type test was

T’(X — E(X))w1m1;,W(x — E(X))IT, (15)
and the score test for the C-alpha-type test was

Tm ( ( ))W W< ( )) < 6)

Both score tests for rare variant analysis could be generalized to

 

T,HT T‘(X — E(X))WRW(X — E(X))‘T, (17)

and for a given constant c 6 [0,1], Sc was denoted by

We denoted eigenvalues for El/ZWWEI/2 by 1k. If we let xk’s be

we have

and

k=1
The P—values for S1 and So were, respectively, denoted by FAR VA T b and
FARVATC, and in particular, FARVATC can be calculated with the
Davies method (Davies, 1980) or the method described by Liu et a].
(Lee et al., 2012b; Liu et al., 2009).

2.3 Extension of SI and SO to the SKAT-O-type statistic

The burden test is known to be efﬁcient if all rare variants have either
deleterious or protective effects on disease; otherwise, the C-alpha test is
more efﬁcient (Neale et al., 2011). A balanced approach for both scen-
arios can be achieved by the SKAT-O-type statistic (Lee et al., 2012). For
c0 = 0< c1<. . .< CL: 1, we denoted the observed value for Sc, by sq, and
their corresponding P—values were denoted by p5,. Furthermore, we
denoted the (1 — p)th quantile for SC, by ch(p). If we let

pmin =min {pc0,pc,,  4%,}. (21)
our ﬁnal P—value was obtained by
1 _ P(Sc0 E Q60 (pmin)a - - -a ScL E QCL(pmin))° 

The numerical calculation of the ﬁnal P—value for the independent samples
was derived by Lee et a]. (2012), and our ﬁnal P—values, denoted by
FAR VA T 0, were calculated based on their approach with some modiﬁcation.

If we let Z = El/ZW and Z = Zlm(1fn 1m)71, the projection matrix onto

a space spanned by Z becomes 11:7(72’17. If we let

_ 1 l l —1 —1 l —1 —1/2

u~ M VN(0, Im), and Sc, becomes
5,, = u121/2WRW21/ 2n = u’ZRZ’u

 

__t (24)

As was shown by Lee et a]. (2012), if we let

we have
Sc = 1 — cj)ul Im — H)ZZl(Im — H)u

where u’(Im — H)ZZ’(Im — H)u, u’(Im — H)ZZ’Hu and u’Hu are mutu-
ally independent. Therefore,
P(Sc0 E Qco(pmin)s - - w Sq E QCL(pmin))
:E{P(Sc0 S Qco(pmin)a - - -a Sq E QcL(Pmin))llllHll=77)},

and the following conditional probability can be numerically calculated,
as was suggested by Lee et al. (2012):

P(Sc0 E Qc0(pmin)a - - -a ScL E QCL(pmin))|ulHu: 77)°

2.4 The simulation model

In our simulation studies, we considered extended families that consisted
of 10 individuals, and extended over three generations (see Supplemen-
tary Fig. Sl). To generate the genotypes for extended families, haplotypes

were simulated with COSI software (Schaffner et al., 2005), based on the
coalescent model, and obtained haplotypes were used for founders’ geno-
types. In the coalescent model for COSI, we assumed that the mutation
rate was 1.5 X 1078, and 5000 haplotypes with 50 000 bp were generated.
m rare variants in a region or all rare variants for which MAFs were
<0.01 were randomly selected, and pairs of haplotypes were randomly
chosen with replacement to derive the founders’ genotypes. Under the
assumption of no recombination, a haplotype from each founder was
randomly selected to construct non-founders’ genotypes under the as-
sumption of Mendelian transmission.

The disease status for each individual was generated with the liability
threshold model. The underlying liabilities were deﬁned by summing the
phenotypic mean, polygenic effect, common environmental effect, main
genetic effect and random error. The phenotypic mean ,80 was assumed to
be 0, and the polygenic effect, common environmental effect and random
errors were generated from the normal distribution with mean 0.
Variances for the polygenic effect, common environmental effect and
random errors were denoted by of” of and 0:, respectively, and were
assumed to be 1. In this setting, the heritability was 1/3. The polygenic
effect was independently generated from N(0, 03,) for founders, and the
average of maternal and paternal polygenic effects was combined with
values independently sampled from N(0, 0.50;) for the polygenic effects
of offspring. Common environmental effects were assumed to be the
same for all individuals in each family. We assumed there were m rare
variants, and their main genetic effects for each individual were the prod-
uct of ,8k and the number of disease alleles. If we let [1: be the relative
proportion of variance explained by rare variants, ,Bk were sampled from
U(1.0, v), and v was calculated by

 

(of, + 0% + 03%},

(1 — 102131321941 —pk)
k=1

 

(29)

v:

Under the null hypothesis, It: was set to 0, and ,Bk became 0. Once the
underlying liabilities of main genetic effects, polygenic effects, common
environmental effects and random errors were generated, they were trans-
formed to being affected if they were larger than the threshold; otherwise,
they were considered as unaffected. The threshold was chosen to preserve
the assumed prevalence, and the disease prevalence was assumed to be
0.12. Families with more than two affected grandchildren were used for
simulation studies, and sampling was repeated until the given numbers of
these families were obtained.

Furthermore, the robustness of the proposed statistic under the presence
of the population substructure was evaluated with simulated data. We
assumed that there were two subpopulations, and each founder was as-
signed to the one of the two subpopulations with 50% probability. Means
of liabilities for phenotypes in both populations differed by 0.2. The allele
frequencies for each marker in the two subpopulations were generated by
the Balding—Nichols model (Balding and Nichols, 1995). That is, for
marker k, the allele frequency, pk, in an ancestral population was generated
from U(0.0001, 0.01), and the marker allele frequencies for the two sub-
populations were independently sampled from the beta distributions (pk(1
— FST)/FST, (1 — pk)(1 — FST)/FST). A survey reported FST estimates with a
median of 0.008 and a 90th percentile of 0.028 among Europeans; the
corresponding values were 0.027 and 0.14, respectively, among Africans,
and 0.043 and 0.12, respectively, among Asian (Cavalli-Sforza and Piazza,
1993). The values for Wright’s FSTwere assumed to be 0.005, 0.01 and 0.05.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Simulation studies

3.1.] Evaluation with simulated data under the absence ofpopula-
tion substructure The statistical validity of FAR VA T 1,,

FAR VA T C and FAR VA T 0 was evaluated under the absence of
population substructure, and the results were compared with
PedCMC, FPCA (Zhu and Xiong, 2012) and RV-TDT meth-
ods (He et al., 2014). RV-TDT methods consist of BRV.T01,
BRV.Hapo.T01, CMC.T01, CMC.Hapo.T01, VT.BRV.Hapo,
VT.CMC.Hapo and WSS.Hapo. We generated 50 and 100 ex-
tended families in each replicate, and empirical type 1 error
estimates at the 0.05, 0.01 and 0.001 signiﬁcance levels were
calculated with 50 000 replicates. For the proposed methods,
1 and [pk(l — pk)]’1/2 were considered for wk, and the kinship
coefﬁcients were used to build the correlation matrix (1). Rare
variants for which MAFs were <0.01 were considered for all
statistics. In Supplementary Tables S1 and S2, 30 and 100 rare
variants were randomly selected, and in Supplementary Table
S3, all rare variants in the 30 kb genetic region were considered.
These results showed that the empirical type 1 error estimates
for FARVAT 1,, FARVATC and FARVATO preserved the nom-
inal signiﬁcance levels. However, CMC.T01, BRV.Hapo.T01,
CMC.Hapo.T01, VT.BRV.Hapo, VT.CMC.Hapo, WSS.Hapo
and FPCA were usually conservative, and BRV.T01 and
PedCMC seemed to be liberal. For PedCMC, genotype scores
of individuals with more than or equal to a single rare allele
were considered as 1; otherwise, they were 0. If the large
number of rare variants is collapsed, its convergence to the
chi-square distribution requires very large sample sizes, and
genotype scores for all individuals can be 1 in extreme scen-
arios. Therefore, we could conclude that PedCMC may not be a
good choice when the number of rare variants in a gene is very
large.

The statistical efﬁciency of FARVA T1,, FARVATC and
FARVATO was evaluated with the simulated data, and results
were compared with results from PedCMC, FPCA and RV-
TDT methods (He et al., 2014; Zhu and Xiong, 2012). We
assumed that the relative proportion of variances explained by
rare variants h: was 0.05. In each replicate, we assumed that all
rare variants had either deleterious or protective effects on dis-
ease, and the proportions of rare variants with deleterious effects
were assumed to be 1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.5. The numbers of extended
families were assumed to be 50 and 100. MAFs for all rare vari-
ants were assumed to be <0.01. Thirty rare variants in Figure 1
and 100 rare variants in Figure 2 were selected, and in Figure 3,
all rare variants within 30 kb from the generated le chromo-
somes were selected. For the proposed methods, each rare
variant was weighed by [pk(l — pk)]71/2 for W. The results in
Figures 1, 2 and 3 showed that FAR VA T1, was the most efﬁcient
if all rare variants had deleterious effects, but the gap between
FAR VA T1, and the second efﬁcient method FAR VA T 0 was small.
However, the power loss of FAR VA T1, was substantial when rare
variants with deleterious and protective variants were present in
a gene.

If the proportion of rare variants with deleterious effects was
0.5, FARVA T C was the most efﬁcient, followed by FARVA T 0.
PedCMC and FPCA were usually more efﬁcient than RV—TDT
methods, but these approaches were not efﬁcient compared with
FARVATO in the considered scenarios. Therefore, even though
the most powerful statistic depended on the disease model, we
concluded that FAR VA T 0 was generally efﬁcient choice under
the various disease models.

3.1.2 Evaluation with simulated data under the presence ofpopula-
tion substructure We assumed that there were two subpopula-
tions, and founders in each family were randomly selected from
two different population substructures. Two subpopulations
were simulated with the Balding—Nichols model (Balding and
Nichols, 1995), and FST values were assumed to be 0.005, 0.01
and 0.05. To provide robustness against the population substruc-
ture, (I) was estimated by 20 000 common variants for which
MAFs were >0.05 (Thornton and McPeek, 2010), and this was
incorporated to the proposed methods. It should be noted that
the proposed method was an extension of the MQLS statistic
(Thornton and McPeek, 2007) to rare variant association ana-
lysis, and that M Q LS becomes robust under the presence of popu-
lation substructure if (I) was estimated with large-scale genomic
data (Thornton and McPeek, 2010).

In Supplementary Table S4, we calculated empirical type 1
error estimates from 50 000 replicates at the 0.01, 0.005 and
0.001 signiﬁcance levels. Our results showed that the empirical
type 1 error estimates for FARVAT], and FARVA T 0 preserved
the nominal signiﬁcance levels for the considered F ST values.
However, FPCA, PedCMC and RV-TDT methods were usually
conservative, and the level of conservativeness was proportional
to the amount of F ST. FAR VA T C was also conservative, but was
less sensitive than FPCA, PedCMC and RV—TDT methods.
Furthermore, we evaluated the statistical efﬁciency under the
presence of population substructure with the simulated data.
We assumed that h: was 0.05, and the empirical power estimates
were calculated with 5000 replicates at the 0.001 signiﬁcance

Fig. 2. Empirical power estimates when the number of rare variants in a
gene is 100. h: was assumed to be 0.05 and the empirical power estimates
were calculated with 5000 replicates at the 0.001 signiﬁcance levels. MAFs
for all variants were assumed to be <0.01, and 100 rare variants were
randomly selected. Each rare variant had either deleterious or protective
effect on disease, and proportions of rare variants with deleterious effect
were 1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.5. The numbers of families were assumed to be 50
and 100

level. As shown in Figure 4, the most efﬁcient approach differed
depending on the disease model. For instance, FARVAT], was
the most efﬁcient when all rare variants had deleterious effects,
and FAR VA T C was the most efﬁcient when half of the rare vari-
ants had deleterious effects. FARVATO was usually the second
most efﬁcient; however, the power gap between FAR VA T 0 and
the most efﬁcient method was always small. As a result, we
concluded that FARVA T 0 was generally a robust and efﬁcient
choice for various disease models under the presence of popula-
tion substructure.

3.2 Analysis of GAW17 simulated data

The statistical efﬁciency of the proposed methods was evaluated
with the binary trait in GAW17 simulated data (Almasy et al.,
2011). There were 200 replicates in GAW17 simulated data, and
each replicate consisted of 209 affected and 488 unaffected indi-
viduals distributed in eight extended pedigrees. In 1714 genes,
there were 13 784 variants, and MAFs for 10 710 variants were
<0.05. In each gene, rare variants for which MAFs were <0.05
were considered for analysis with the proposed methods, and
genes in which the number of rare variants was less than or
equal to two were excluded from the analysis. To provide the
robustness of the proposed methods under the presence of popu-
lation substructure, the empirical genetic relationship matrix be-
tween individuals was estimated with the common variants. The
disease status was decided by the underlying liability, and the top
30% of the underlying liability distribution was declared as being
affected. In particular, some covariates were related to the

Fig. 3. Empirical power estimates when all rare variants in a gene are
considered. h: was assumed to be 0.05, and the empirical power estimates
were calculated with 5000 replicates at the 0.001 signiﬁcance levels. All
rare variants of which MAFs are <0.01 are used to calculate each stat-
istic. Each rare variant had either deleterious or protective effect on dis-
ease, and proportions of rare variants with deleterious effect were 1, 0.8,
0.6 and 0.5. The numbers of families were assumed to be 50 and 100

underlying liability, and the disease prevalence (Thornton and
McPeek, 2010) and BLUP from the linear mixed model (W on
and Lange, 2013) were used as offsets. For the linear mixed
model, we included sex, age, smoking status and 10 principal
component scores calculated from the estimated (1) (Thornton
and McPeek, 2010). Among 36 genes related to binary traits,
20 genes consisted of more than one rare variant, and their em-
pirical powers were determined by counting the number of rep-
licates for which P—values of causal genes were <0.05, 0.01 and
0.001. As shown in Supplementary Tables S5 and S6, most
causal genes were not detectable with the proposed methods;
however, KDR, VEGFA, SIRT] and VLDLR had relatively
high rates of detection. By using RV-TDT methods, we could
not ﬁnd any causal genes. In Supplementary Figures S2 and S3,
we provided the qq-plots and Manhattan plots of RV—TDT
methods, PedCMC, FARVA T1,, FARVA T C and FARVA T 0 with
the ﬁrst replicate of GAW17 simulated data. While PedCMC
was not conservative, results from the other methods seemed
to be valid. As shown in Supplementary Figure S3, we found
that VEGFA was the most signiﬁcant for FAR VA T 0.

3.3 Real data analysis

The proposed methods were applied to the genetic association
analysis of rare variants in schizophrenia. Thirty-six trios were
collected from Germany for which offspring were affected,
whereas parents were unaffected. The whole genomes for all in-
dividuals were sequenced. There were 10 829 265 bi—allelic

Fig. 4. Empirical power estimates under the presence of population sub-
structure. hfl was assumed to be 0.05, and the empirical power estimates
were calculated with 5000 replicates at the 0.001 signiﬁcance levels under
the presence of population substructure. FST was assumed to be 0.005,
0.01 and 0.05. MAFs for all variants are assumed to be <0.01, and 30 rare
variants are randomly selected. Each rare variant had either deleterious
or protective effect on disease, and proportions of rare variants with
deleterious effect were 1, 0.8, 0.6 and 0.5. The numbers of families were
assumed to be 100

variants, and MAFs of 31860 among them were <0.05.
Markers with high missing call rates (>5%) or signiﬁcant devi-
ation from Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium (P<1 X 1075) were
excluded, and trios were ﬁltered out if 10% of variants had
Mendelian transmission errors. As a result, 9216373 common
variants and 31 046 rare variants for 105 trios were analyzed with
the proposed methods.

Each rare variant was annotated by the Sanff program
(Cingolani et al., 2012) with the UCSC HGl9 database.
Sanff 3.2a categorized each variant to four groups: HIGH,
MODERATE, LOW and MODIFIER. In our analysis, rare
variants assigned to LOW and MODIFIER categories may
have little or no effect on protein function, and they were not
considered in our analysis. For each gene, the rare variants with
HIGH and MODERATE effects were separately analyzed with
the proposed methods. In addition, if MAC of all rare variants in
each gene were 35, the asymptotic convergence of the proposed
method to chi-square distribution may not be provided, and P-
values were calculated for genes for which the MAC was :5. In
total, P—values were calculated for 13053 genes. For the pro-
posed methods, the prevalence of schizophrenia was assumed
to be 0.0063, and each rare variant was weighted by [pk(l —
pk)]71/2 for W. To provide robustness under the presence of popu-
lation substructure, the genetic relationship matrix was estimated
with common variants, and these data were incorporated into the

sented in Figure 5, although RV-TDT methods, PedCMC and
FARVATC methods were conservative and FARVA T1, showed
some violations, FAR VA T 0 uniquely seems valid. Figure 6
shows the Manhattan plots for the all methods, and the gen-
ome-wide signiﬁcant results from RV—TDT, FARVAT],
and FARVA T 0 are summarized in Table 1. We found two
genome-wide signiﬁcant genes with WSS.Hapo, FARVA T1, and
FARVATO, and these genome-wide signiﬁcant genes will be fur-
ther investigated with replication studies.

4 DISCUSSION

In this article, we proposed burden-type, C-alpha-type and
SKAT-O—type statistics for the association analysis of rare vari-
ants for binary traits with extended families. The proposed meth-
ods were compared with results of PedCMC, FPCA and RV-
TDT methods (He et al., 2014; Zhu and Xiong, 2012), and with
extensive simulations, we showed that the proposed method was
more efﬁcient than existing approaches. In particular, we found
that the most efﬁcient statistic among the proposed statistics
differed according to the disease model. However, they were usu-
ally followed by the SKAT-O-type statistic in such scenarios, and
the power differences between the most efﬁcient statistic and the
SKAT-O—type statistic were small. Therefore, FAR VA T 0 seemed
to be a robust choice for the analysis of rare variants in extended
families.

Furthermore, the proposed method was very rapid computa-
tionally, and the FARVAT software for the proposed methods

family design could be conducted within a few hours. FAR VAT
can handle various input ﬁle formats, such as the ped, bed and
vcf ﬁles, and multithreaded genome-wide association analyses
can be conducted. The software calculates various statistics for
the analysis of extended families, and it is freely downloadable
from http://biostat.cau.ac.kr/farvat/.

However, despite the analytical ﬂexibility of the proposed
method, it has some limitations. First, the proposed method
could be less efﬁcient if some covariates associated with dis-
ease status or phenotypes of interest were continuous. Our
recent investigation found that the power improvement of
the analysis with phenotypes adjusted by BLUP could be sub-
stantial if each family was randomly selected (\N on and Lange,
2013). Under certain scenarios, however, power loss may be
expected, and the further investigation is necessary. Second, we
showed that incorporation of the estimated correlation matrix
to the proposed statistics provided sufﬁcient robustness for the
proposed method against the presence of population substruc-
ture. However, if large-scale common variants were not avail-
able or the level of population substructure depended on the
genomic location, the proposed adjustment with the estimated
correlation matrix did not perform appropriately (Price et al.,
2006; Won et al., 2009), and different strategies would be ne-
cessary according to the level of population substructure. If
large-scale common variants are not available, the FBAT or
TDT statistics, based on so-called within-family components,
is uniquely robust to population substructure, and the burden-
type test for the FBAT statistic or RV-TDT methods can be
used (De et al., 2013; He et al., 2014). If the genomic ancestry
for each individual differs for some genomic locations, the so-
called hybrid-analysis strategy (Won et al., 2009) can be a
suitable alternative. The proposed method can simply be ex-
tended to the statistic based on the between-family component
(\Non and Lange, 2013), and its rank-based P—value can be
combined with the FBAT burden-type test or SKAT-O-type
test.

Advances in genotyping technology will lead to substantial
cost reductions for genome sequencing, and it is expected that
whole genome sequencing may be feasible for less than a few
hundred US. dollars in the near future. Importantly, most of
human genome consists of rare variants, and thus, we expect that
the genetic background for ‘missing heritability’ can be deter-
mined by rare variant association analysis (Manolio et al.,
2009). However, rare variant association analysis is disrupted
by genetic heterogeneity, and in this context, the importance of
rare variant analysis with extended families has often been raised
(Ionita-Laza et al., 2011). The proposed method enables the ana-
lysis of rare variants within extended families, and its application
to extended families may provide a breakthrough for the success
of genetic association analysis.

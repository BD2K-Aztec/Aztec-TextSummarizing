ABSTRACT

Summary: CellDesigner provides a user-friendly interface for
graphical biochemical pathway description. Many pathway
databases are not directly exportable to CellDesigner models.
PathwayAccess is an extensible suite of CellDesigner plugins,
which connect CellDesigner directly to pathway databases using
respective Java application programming interfaces. The process
is streamlined for creating new PathwayAccess plugins for specific
pathway databases. Three PathwayAccess plugins, MetNetAccess,
BioCycAccess and ReactomeAccess, directly connect CellDesigner
to the pathway databases MetNetDB, BioCyc and Reactome.
PathwayAccess plugins enable CellDesigner users to expose
pathway data to analytical CellDesigner functions, curate their
pathway databases and visually integrate pathway data from
different databases using standard Systems Biology Markup
Language and Systems Biology Graphical Notation.

Availability: Implemented in Java, PathwayAccess plugins run
with CellDesigner version 4.0.1 and were tested on Ubuntu
Linux, Windows XP and 7, and MacOSX. Source code, binaries,
documentation and video walkthroughs are freely available at
http://vrac.iastate.edu/~jlv

1 INTRODUCTION

CellDesigner (Funahashi et al., 2008) is a tool for graphically
building biochemical pathway models, which integrate model
representation by Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML;
Hucka et al., 2003) with graphical representation by Systems
Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN; Moodie et al., 2009). There
exist many databases providing application programming interface
(API) libraries enabling programmatic queries. These API libraries
include many biologically meaningful objects, which carry out
intuitive functions. For example, a pathway object can report the set
of reaction objects it contains, a protein complex object can report
the monomer objects that contsruct it and a metabolite object might
report its SMILES and InChi codes. The problem is that a Pathway
object in one API is not the same as a Pathway object in the API
of a different database. The same biological concept is represented
using independently developed in—silico representations, preventing
any single application from communicating and integrating across
databases.

respective APIs to communicate with different pathway databases and
integrate data in CellDesigner. As indicated by arrows, depending on
functionality supported by the datasource, dataﬂow is uni— or bi—directional.

2 FUNCTIONALITY

PathwayAccess plugins directly interact with pathway databases
so that the user can download one or more pathways to a
CellDesigner model and upload (or commit) a CellDesigner model
to a database. Figure 1 shows a dataﬂow diagram for typical use of
the PathwayAccess plugins.

The PathwayAccess plugin framework confers three major
beneﬁts, depending on whether individual database APIs support
data retrieval and modiﬁcation. First, the plugins make pathways
stored in remote databases available to the powerful modeling
and simulation functionality already provided by CellDesigner.
Second, SBGN implemented by CellDesigner provides a standard
representation for biologists to curate pathway databases; the user
can create a pathway model and commit it to the database of his
choice. A user can also download a pathway model from a database,
edit it and commit it back to the database, either replacing the
original pathway or creating a different version. Third, CellDesigner
can be effective in visually comparing and integrating pathway data
from one or many different databases; metabolic networks can be
downloaded directly into CellDesigner and integrated into custom
super—pathways. CellDesigner can export pathways into ﬁles for
loading into other software such as Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003),
where SBGN is an ancilliary feature to network analysis functions.

Since CellDesigner and most datasources’ user interfaces provide
good automatic layouts, layouts are left to the datasources and
CellDesigner independently.

2.1 Pathway integration across databases

When PathwayAccess plugins download pathways, they are
integrated with the growing model in memory. CellDesigner is suited
to support integration because it uses the XML—based SBML data
model not only for ﬁle storage, but also for objects in memory—
ideal for representing annotations integrated from different sources.

Among other annotations, PathwayAccess stores synonyms this way,
enabling it to match integrated objects in the same subcellular
compartment that may be named differently across databases.
To prevent duplicate reactions in integrated pathways, a reaction
hashing algorithm calculates a unique integer for every combination
of reaction substrates, products and catalysts (see Supplementary
Material). Each PathwayAccess plugin has a unique, but editable
highlight color, which can be used to color the model objects
downloaded using that plugin. Objects from multiple databases are
colored by mixing the colors of the plugins that downloaded them.

2.2 Creating new PathwayAccess plugins

The PathwayAccess framework includes a core library plus one or
more independent plugins. A plugin developer can easily create
a new CellDesigner plugin that communicates with any pathway
database providing a Java API. Simply create a new CellDesigner
plugin object using the PathwayAccess library and deﬁne a set of
simple database query operations, depending on whether the plugin
will support download and/or saving a model to the database. To
create a PathwayAccess plugin that downloads a pathway, deﬁne
18 simple functions such as to get the synonyms of an object
(pathway, metabolite, gene, etc). To design a commit feature, deﬁne
nine simple functions such as add substrates to a reaction in the
database. With these simple operations deﬁned for communicating
with a database, PathwayAccess handles all interaction both with
CellDesigner and the database, similarly to Cytoscape’s Data
Integration Request For Comments (Killcoyne et al., 2009), and
provides a way to enrich objects beyond the annotation used for
integration.

2.3 Examples

Three PathwayAccess plugins, MetNetAccess, BioCycAccess and
ReactomeAccess were created. In addition to representing biological
objects differently, each uses a different communication protocol:
SQL, Sockets and Web Services, respectively.

2.3 .1 BioCycAccess: download and commit to a Pathway Genome
Database BioCyc databases are individually deployed for speciﬁc
organisms and purposes (http://www.biocyc.org; Karp et al., 2005).
BioCycAccess uses J avaCch, our new library wrapped around the
JavaCyc API (Krummenacker et al., 2005; Mueller et al., 2005),
running in client mode to connect to a BioCyc Pathway Genome
Database that is running J avaCch in server mode. It supports both
downloading and committing pathways.

2.3.2 ReactomeAccess: download from Reactome Reactome
is a large repository for pathways (Matthews et al., 2009).
ReactomeAccess supports downloading pathways from Reactome
directly into CellDesigner models via an API wrapped around
Reactome’s web services.

2.3.3 MetNetAccess: download and commit to MetNet
MetNetAccess provides CellDesigner access to the pathway
database MetNetDB using MetNetAPI (Sucaet et al., 2010), which
is wrapped around SQL queries. It supports both downloading and
committing pathways. MetNetDB is an integrated pathway database

that currently includes Arabidopsis thaliana, yeast, soybean and the
grapevine. MetNetAccess has been used to curate many pathways
for different organisms in MetNetDB (Wurtele et al., 2007). MetNet
allows public downloading of data, but only registered curators
may modify data in MetNetDB.

3 IMPACT

The PathwayAccess suite of CellDesigner plugins is a powerful
tool for researchers who work with metabolic pathway data and
wish to take advantage of graphical and computational CellDesigner
features. By directly accessing and publishing to pathway databases,
decentralized pathway integration and comparison is made possible
over simply saving and loading SBML ﬁles. Although three
PathwayAccess plugins have been released, the practical scope of
the PathwayAccess library is as wide as the number of databases to
which CellDesigner can connect because communication requires
a Java API. MetNetAccess, BioCycAccess, ReactomeAccess and
future PathwayAccess plugins enable CellDesigner users to expose
pathway data to analytical CellDesigner functions as well as visually
integrate and curate pathway data from different databases using
standard SBGN—something that has been previously prevented by
disparate in silico representations of biological objects.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Computer-assisted studies of structure, function and evo-
lution of viruses remains a neglected area of research. The attention of
bioinformaticians to this interesting and challenging field is far from
commensurate with its medical and biotechnological importance. It is
telling that out of >200 talks held at ISMB 2013, the largest interna-
tional bioinformatics conference, only one presentation explicitly dealt
with viruses. In contrast to many broad, established and well-
organized bioinformatics communities (e.g. structural genomics, ontol-
ogies, next-generation sequencing, expression analysis), research
groups focusing on viruses can probably be counted on the fingers
of two hands.

Results: The purpose of this review is to increase awareness among
bioinformatics researchers about the pressing needs and unsolved
problems of computational virology. We focus primarily on RNA
viruses that pose problems to many standard bioinformatics analyses
owing to their compact genome organization, fast mutation rate and
low evolutionary conservation. We provide an overview of tools and
algorithms for handling viral sequencing data, detecting functionally
important RNA structures, classifying viral proteins into families and
investigating the origin and evolution of viruses.

1 INTRODUCTION

Viruses have been the ﬁrst biological systems for which complete
genomic information became available: bacteriophage M52 in
1976 and CI) X174 in 1977. By the mid 1990s, multiple strains
of important human pathogens, in particular HIV, had been
sequenced, laying the foundation for a systematic comparative
genomics of the diverse Virus families. With the completion of the
human genome and the sequencing of hundred of eukaryotic and
thousands of prokaryotic genomes, however, the bioinformatics
community focussed almost entirely on these much larger and
more complex systems. With few exceptions, most Viral genomes
are thus relatively poorly annotated and few computational tools
and techniques have been developed speciﬁcally for the many
idiosyncratic features of individual Virus families.

The small size of Viral genomes makes it possible to sequence
large numbers of isolates, usually in clinical context, that are
unavailable for any living systems. This ﬂood of sequencing
data in itself calls for speciﬁc methods of analysis, which so far
are available in part at best.

In this survey we concentrate on RNA Viruses. They form a
highly diverse grouping, usually classiﬁed in terms of their
genome organization. They may have a single-stranded (ss)
genome in either plus (e. g. Poliovirus, Enterovirus, Hepatitis-
A-Virus) or in minus orientation (e.g. Rabiesvirus, maize-
mosaic-Virus), or a double-stranded (ds) RNA genome (e.g.
Rotavirus), or ssRNA with a dsDNA as an intermediate product
(e. g. Retroviruses including HIW. Nevertheless, they share sev-
eral common features. In particular, their genomes are small,
ranging from 3400 (Enterobacteria phage B213) to 31 OOOnt
(coronavirus), encoding just a handful of proteins.
Furthermore, their mutation rates are large enough to form a

quasi-species rather than a single genetically homogenous species
in the classical sense.

Many of the common questions raised in Virology call for
speciﬁc bioinformatics support: How is Viral gene expression
regulated? How do RNA Viruses evolve? How common are
they? Have we already seen the whole diversity of RNA Virus
families or genera? How quickly do they change? How often do
variations occur? How important is recombination in Viral evo-
lution? Is there a single common Viral origin or do we ﬁnd clearly
independent origins?

In this contribution we review the state of the art of the com-
putational methods that have helped to address some of these
questions. In particular, we will be concerned with (i) ﬁnding and
assembling Viral genomes based on RNA-seq data, (ii) regulatory
RNA elements and processed subgenomic RNA species, (iii)
classiﬁcation problems regarding Viral protein families, (iv)
phylogenetics and evolution of RNA Viruses and (V) Virus—host
associations as a basis for biomedical applications.

2 DISCOVERY OF VIRAL SEQUENCES

Viruses display high genetic diversity both within and among
Viral species as well as within and among infected hosts.
Although next-generation sequencing provides cost-effective
access to high-throughput data, inferring the Viral genetic diver-
sity of a mixed sample from deep-coverage sequencing data has
remained a challenging task. The reasons lie in difﬁculties of
sample preparation and sequencing errors, short read length
and, in particular, an incomplete a priori knowledge of existing
Viruses and their diversity. Viral diversity estimation may range
from identifying Viral species in metagenomics studies to recon-
structing the individual mutants in the intra-host population of a
single species.

The composition of a mixed sample can be assessed by meta-
genomics approaches, reviewed in F ancello et al. (2012), Mokili
et al. (2012) and Reyes et al. (2012). A main approach is sequence
read annotation by taxonomic classiﬁcation using existing refer-
ence genomes and databases (http://www.rna.uni—jena.de/rna.
php). In many metagenomics applications, however, classiﬁca-
tion is not possible because the majority of sequences have no
known reference genome or homolog (Edwards and Rohwer,
2005). In this case, de novo discovery of Viral species can be per-
formed by state—of—the-art de novo genome assemblers. These
methods try to assemble the genomes of the major species in
the sample, ignoring low-frequency variants and technical errors.

Once the (reference) genomes are known and reads are classi-
ﬁed, the resolution of diversity estimation can be increased by
inferring the Viral population structure of each individual species.
Intra—host Virus populations consist of many related mutants,
generated by mutation, recombination and selection. Even low-
frequency variants can be of great interest, for example, because
they may harbor drug resistance mutations (Barzon et al., 2011),
facilitate immune escape (Luciani et al., 2012) or affect Virulence
(Tépfer et al., 2013a). Estimating intra—host Viral genetic diversity
and reconstructing the individual haplotype sequences relies on
both error correction and read assembly. It can be performed on
different spatial scales, including single sites of the genome
(Single-Nucleotid-Varient calling), small sliding windows (local
reconstruction) or complete genomes (global reconstruction).

Current Viral haplotype reconstruction tools, reviewed in
Beerenwinkel et al. (2012), Beerenwinkel and Zagordi (2011)
and Vrancken et al. (2010), can quantify Viral diversity from
NGS data, with recombinant population structure (Tépfer et
al., 2013b), provided that haplotypes differ enough, reads are
not too short and coverage is high (Zagordi et al., 2012). A
common prerequisite for these tools is a high-quality alignment
of the reads.

As of today, NGS-based discovery of Viral sequences in mixed
samples remains challenging because most analysis steps are not
easily automated and each one has technical or biological limi-
tations. There is a need for an integrated workﬂow combining
the different processing steps in Viral diversity studies to discover
the underlying Virus populations that can be used on a daily basis
by clinicians and Virologists.

3 STRUCTURAL RNA ELEMENTS
3.1 Detection and distribution of structured RNAs

The realization that conserved RNA structure plays a role in
Virology dates back to the beginning of the 1980s (Ahlquist et
al., 1981). Most of the structured Viral RNA elements contained
in the Rf am database are cis-acting elements, in particular in-
ternal ribosomal entry sites (IRES), cis-acting replication elem-
ents and other elements located in the untranslated regions
(UTRs) of RNA Viruses. Functional RNA structures also
appear to be abundant within the Viral coding regions.
Furthermore, regular arrangements of hairpins throughout the
genomic RNA have been shown to be instrumental for packa-
ging in Leviviridae (Dykeman et al., 2011) and some satellite
Viruses (Schroeder et al., 2011). Evolutionary conserved large-
scale ordering of RNA Virus genomes seems to be abundant in
many animal and plant Viruses (Davis et al., 2008).

The ﬁrst systematic searches for conserved, and hence likely
functional, RNA secondary structure elements were performed
in RNA Viruses more than a decade ago (Rauscher et al., 1997).
This stimulated the development of early computational methods
(Hofacker and Stadler, 1999; Hofacker et al., 1998) capable of
surveying alignments of complete Virus genomes (Thurner et al.,
2004; Witwer et al., 2001) for local RNA motifs in which the
structure is more conserved than the underlying sequence.
Somewhat surprisingly, however, the next generation of com-
parative RNA secondary structure predictors such as RNAz
(Washietl et al., 2005) and evo f old (Pedersen et al., 2006) ap-
parently have not been used extensively on Virus data. The results
of (Davis et al., 2008) suggest that coverage with conserved sec-
ondary structure varies substantially between Virus families.

Viral RNAs have recently become accessible to structural
probing at larger scales using combinations of SHAPE and
sequencing. The analysis of these data requires both elaborate
processing of the raw SHAPE data (Pang et al., 2011) and the
incorporation of these data into RNA structure prediction algo-
rithms in the form of constraints (Reuter and Mathews, 2010;
Washietl et al., 2012). First results include the HCV 5’ UTR
(Pang et al., 2011) and the secondary structure of a complete
HIV-1 genome (Watts et al., 2009). As essentially all RNA mol-
ecules form secondary structures, one has to keep in mind that
the entire structure is not necessarily of functional relevance.

3.2 Viral non-coding RNAs

In addition to proteins, Viruses may also encode non-coding
RNAs (ncRNAs). Although most of the well-described examples
have been found in Viruses with DNA genomes, we include a
brief overview here for two reasons: ﬁrst, ncRNAs do appear in
retroviruses, and second, it is at least conceivable that processing
products of Viral RNAs might act as ncRNA species.

The formation of independent functional RNA species is a
widespread phenomenon among diverse Virus families, best
known but apparently not limited to DNA Viruses (Table 1).
The largest class are Virus-encoded microRNAs (miRNA), of
which >200 distinct types have been reported during the
past decade (Grundhoff, 2011; Grundhoff and Sullivan, 2011),
with herpesviruses accounting for the overwhelming majority
of examples (Boss et al., 2009). Smaller numbers of
examples have been reported also in Polyomaviridae,
Ascoviridae, Baculoviridae and Retroviridae. Viral miRNAs
appear to regulate Viral-encoded transcripts and/or networks of
host genes predominantly using the host miRNA regulation
systems.

In contrast to animal and plant miRNAs, their Viral counter-
parts are often poorly conserved. This complicates both their
annotation in newly sequenced genomes (Grundhoff, 2011;
Grundhoff and Sullivan, 2011) and the computational recon-
struction of their interaction networks (Ghosh et al., 2009;
Kim et al., 2012). Nowadays, new Viral miRNAs are usually
found by means of deep sequencing, see e.g. (Tuddenham
et al., 2012). A recurring computational problem in this context
is to distinguish bona ﬁde miRNAs from small degradation
products.

The RNA repertoire of herpesvirus species is by no means
restricted to miRNAs, Table 1. They also encode a diverse set
of small nuclear RNAs with diverse functions, a small nucleolar
RNA and even a derived copy of the telomerase RNA compo-
nent. In some cases, unrelated ncRNAs from different families
have analogous functions. For instance, both the EBER-1 RNA
of the herpesvirus EBV and the VA—I RNAs of adenoviruses are
effective inhibitors of PKR activation (McKenna et al., 2006).
Again, the oftentimes poor conservation and the diversity of the
Viral RNAs complicate their annotation.

A related topic is subviral RNAs and satellite RNAs. In par-
ticular, plant Viruses often bring with them non-coding deletion
mutants. These defective interfering RNAs often maintain cru-
cial cis-acting RNA elements (Pathak and Nagy, 2009), which
are described in more detail below.

3.3 Secondary structures in the mRNA coding regions

The existence of extensive secondary structures in native mRNAs
is well supported by experimental evidence, and in silico with the
assumption that they have lower folding energies and are thus
more stable than codon—randomized sequences (Katz and Burge,
2003). However, in general and especially for comparatively vari-
able Viral sequences, MFE is considered to be minor relevant
(Rivas and Eddy, 2000; Workman and Krogh, 1999) and com-
pensatory mutations analysis over a broader range of individuals
would be more sophisticated. On the other hand, computational
analysis suggests that the three mRNA functional domains—
5’UTR, CDS and 3’UTR—form largely independent folding
units, while base pairing across domain borders is rare
(Shabalina et al., 2006). Global architectures appear to be
poorly conserved between sequence-similar mRNA molecules
(Chursov et al., 2012b), but evolutionary conserved functional
local secondary structures are abundant (Findeiss et al., 2011;
Meyer and Miklés, 2005; Olivier et al., 2005). The relationship
between mRNA structure and gene expression has been demon-
strated both computationally and experimentally (Carlini et al.,
2001; Duan et al., 2003; Ilyinskii et al., 2009; Kudla et al., 2009;
Nackley et al., 2006). For example, in the inﬂuenza Virus a novel
structural feature was identiﬁed in a functionally important
region of the NS1 mRNA (Ilyinskii et al., 2009). Synonymous
mutations altering this mRNA element lead to signiﬁcantly
reduced protein expression, whereas non-synonymous mutations
designed to preserve this local structure do not affect expression,
implying that distinct secondary structure elements may be im-
portant for Viral gene expression. Reduced mRNA stability near
the start codon has been observed in a wide range of species,
including dsDNA Viruses (Zhou and Wilke, 2011), probably as a
mechanism to facilitate ribosome binding or start codon recog-
nition by initiator-tRNA (Gu et al., 2010). There is also compu-
tational evidence that temperature-induced changes in mRNA
structures may constitute a yet unappreciated molecular mech-
anism of the Virus cold adaptation/temperature sensitivity phe-
nomena (Chursov et al., 2012a).

In a few cases, extensive and well-conserved RNA structures
are superimposed on the coding sequence. Maybe the most im-
pressive example is the IRES of HIV-2 (Herbreteau et al., 2005)
and the Rev-response element in HIV-1 (Pallesen et al., 2009).
Internal RNA elements are also located in the ORF 1b of group 2
coronavirus mouse hepatitis Virus (MHV); here deletion analysis
has identiﬁed a 69-nt bulged stem loop required for packaging
RNAs into particles (F osmire et al., 1992) or the cis-active elem-
ents involved in picornavirus replication (Steil and Barton, 2009).
The latter initiate plus and minus strand RNA synthesis and
Cloverleaf elements, controlling both translation and replication
(Liu et al., 2009a). Another example is the ribosomal frameshift
known, e. g. in coronavirus ORF 1, induced by a short hairpin of
4—11 bp, which also affects genomic and subgenomic RNA pro-
duction (Plant et al., 2013).

M.Matz et al.

 

One particularly intriguing aspect of mRNA life—the one that
makes it distinctly different from any other kind of RNA—is the
dual selection pressure toward maintaining both stable RNA
structures of CDSs and the 3D folds of their encoded proteins
(White et al., 1972). Additional layers of selection arise owing to
miRNA and protein binding sites within the mRNA coding re-
gions. It has been argued that the redundancy of the genetic code
plays an important role in satisfying these requirements
(Shabalina et al., 2006). Evolutionary models able to make a
distinction between the evolutionary pressure at the RNA and
protein level have been proposed (Rubinstein et al., 2011).

In general, structure prediction of the mRNA coding regions
remains an underappreciated area of RNA bioinformatics, argu-
ably because these molecules are large and do not easily yield to
current structure prediction methods and experimental structure-
probing data are only beginning to emerge (Kertesz et al., 2010).
Most of the insights into the evolutionary constraints acting on
mRNAs therefore come from correlating predicted base-paring
patterns with the effects of site-directed mutagenesis on mRNA
expression and degradation as well as on the expression levels
and activity of encoded protein products. On the other hand,
prediction of mRNA secondary structure is facilitated by the
availability of abundant comparative sequence information
both from Viruses and cellular organisms. RNAdecoder
(Meyer and Miklés, 2005; Pedersen et al., 2004) implements a
comparative method for ﬁnding and folding RNA secondary
structures within protein coding regions. A recent survey of ﬂy
genomes (Findeiss et al., 2011), however, indicated that the spe-
ciﬁcity of this combined approach is insufﬁcient for genome-wide
application. The problem of cataloging conserved secondary
structure motifs within coding regions, in particular in Viruses,
remains open.

3.4 The secrets of viral UTRs

Functionally important Viral RNA structures tend to be concen-
trated in the UTRs. This is not unexpected, of course, as UTRs
are typically the only non-coding regions within the densely
packed Virus genomes. A wide range of experimental data dem-
onstrates that the UTRs are essential for determining the efﬁ-
ciency of translation, mRNA lifetime and localization.
Functional UTR elements are often binding sites for Viral or
host proteins, but can also be involved in RNA—RNA inter-
actions either within the genome (cyclization) or with host
RNAs (e. g. the ribosome). UTR structures have been studied
most intensively in positive-strand RNA Viruses (Liu et al.,
2009b), in particular in those affecting humans and/or animal
livestock.

In positive-strand RNA Viruses, the genomic RNA has to
function directly as an mRNA. However, the Viral RNA often
lacks the 5’ cap as well as the poly-A tail of canonical eukaryotic
mRNAs. Eukaryotic translation usually starts with binding of
initiation factors to the 5’ cap, and these in turn recruit the small
ribosomal subunit, which then scans along the mRNA. In 1988,
two independent studies (Jang et al., 1988; Pelletier and
Sonenberg, 1988) showed that certain picornaviruses exhibit a
cap-independent translation initiation mechanism. The struc-
tured RNA region of some 300—700 nt responsible for this mech-
anism was termed ‘internal ribosomal entry site’ (IRES) and is

perhaps the best-studied example of a Viral UTR structure. IRES
structures seem to be present in all Picornaviridae Witwer et al.,
2001). While Viruses in the genus FlaViVirus have a 5’cap, the
other genera of the family Flaviviridae, such as Pestivirus and
Hepacivirus, seem to use IRES structures (Thurner et al.,
2004). In addition, IRESs have been found or implicated in sev-
eral other Viruses including the subgenomic mRNAs of retro-
viruses, see e.g. (Vallejos et al., 2012). While IRES regions
within, for example, the Picornaviridae show signiﬁcant similar-
ity of RNA secondary structure, no such similarities are obvious
across family boundaries, arguing against a common origin of
different IRES structures.

IRES structures are also common in some positive strand
RNA plant Viruses, while others replace the IRES with a struc-
ture in the 3’ UTR, called 3’ cap-independent translation enhan-
cers (3’ CITE) (Nicholson and White, 2011). 3’ CITE structures
are much shorter (~100 nt) and can be grouped into several dis-
tinct classes. Some of them bind translation initiation factors
such as elF4E, while others seem to interact directly with the
ribosome. Cyclization of the RNA is required to then bring
these initiation factors/ribosome close to the translation start
site.

Genome cyclization through complementary sequences in the
5’ and 3’ UTR is a common theme observed in many Virus
families. The ﬂaViViruses are an example among the positive
strand RNA Viruses. Presumably, cyclization improves transla-
tion rates by allowing the ribosome to transfer from the
3’ end back to the start of the coding region. Among negative
strand Viruses, the Bunyaviridae, including Hanta Virus, or
Orthomyxoviridae, including Inﬂuenza Virus exhibits a segmented
genome where each segment has strong complementarity be-
tween 3’ and 5’ end. In UTRs of plant Virus genomes or HCV,
tRNA-like secondary structures are known, which are believed
to interact with the Viral genome and the ribosome may interact
during translation (Annamalai and Rao, 2006; Piron et al.,
2005).

The 5’ UTR and the 3’ UTR feature translation efﬁciency and
replication. Both Picornaviridae and Flaviviridae contain highly
structured UTRs, which, however, differ signiﬁcantly between
genera. In Enterovirus, these structures have been shown to be
essential for the assembly of the RNA-dependent RNA polymer-
ase (RdRp) complex (2011 et al., 2009).

3.5 Cis-acting elements

Apart from target prediction for Viral miRNAs, interactions of
structured RNA elements in Viruses have remained largely unex-
plored. 5’ and 3’ UTRs containing cis-active elements are essen-
tial for Viral genome replication (Ulferts and Ziebuhr, 2011; van
den Born and Snijder, 2008). A complex example is given by
nidoviruses, which synthesize a nested set of 3’ /5’ -coterminal
subgenomic (sg)mRNAs (Stern and Kennedy, 1980; van Berlo
et al., 1982) from which the structural and accessory protein
genes are expressed. The 5’ ends of nidovirus ngNAs share a
leader sequence that is identical to the 5’ -end of the genomic
RNA (de Vries et al., 1990; Spaan et al., 1983; van Vliet et al.,
2002). A copy of this leader sequence is fused to the 3’ -ends of
nascent sg minus-strand RNAs in a process called discontinuous
extension of minus strands (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995; Sawicki

et al., 2007). The so—called transcription regulation sequences
(TRSs) are located upstream of each of the structural and acces-
sory protein genes; however, TRSs is also found downstream of
the 5’ -leader sequence on the Viral genomic RNA (Ulferts and
Ziebuhr, 2011). The proposed coronavirus transcription mech-
anism implies a close interaction between TRS-L and each of the
cTRS-B present in the genomic RNA, imposing strong con-
straints of the evolution of the TRS sequences (Enjuanes et al.,
2001; Zt'lﬁiga et al., 2004). The hypothesis of sngNA synthesis
in coronaviruses requires a minimum thermodynamic stability in
the TRS-L and cTRS-B duplex (Dufour et al., 2011; Sola et al.,
2005) could not be proven in silico for all coronaviruses (Fricke
and Marz, 2013). Corona-, Baﬁni- and Arteriviruses feature such
a leader sequence, while Okaviruses do not (Cowley et al., 2002);
Equine torovirus contains one ngNA with a 5’ -leader sequence
while the other sngNA species are leaderless (van Vliet et al.,
2002).

Coronavirus harbors several additional cis-active elements
forming distinct stem loops involved in regulating ngNA tran-
scription and RNA replication (Li et al., 2008; Liu et al., 2009a;
Raman and Brian, 2005; Raman et al., 2003). The 3’ UTR of
MHV and BoCV upstream end contains a bulged stem loop
and a pseudoknot, which cannot form simultaneously. This
has led to a proposal that these structures are part of a molecular
switch that regulates different steps of replication (Hsue and
Masters, 1997; Williams et al., 1999). Several cis-active structures
are located within the coding regions.

The examples given here are by no means exhaustive. In fact,
the Rfam database features several dozens of distinct families.
Despite their importance for viral control, however, there is no
comprehensive analysis and only a few computational surveys,
see e.g. (Li et al., 2010), have been attempted following a few
family-speciﬁc studies almost a decade ago (Hofacker et al.,
2004; Thurner et al., 2004; Witwer et al., 2001). Comparative
investigations across families and detailed studies into the evolu-
tion of these elements are largely lacking.

4 CLASSIFICATION OF VIRAL PROTEIN FAMILIES

Already early in the era of genomics, NCBI’s Viral genomes pro-
ject established a large-scale comparative resource providing in-
formation on orthology and paralogy of Viral proteins (Bao
et al., 2004). Clusters of related viral proteins (viral orthologous
groups, VOG), as well as the specialized collection of phage
orthologous groups, are available as part of the NCBI protein
clusters (Kristensen et al., 2013; Sayers et al., 2012). Widely used
databases of orthologous proteins such as EggNOG (Powell
et al., 2012), OMA (Altenhoff et al., 2011) or KEGG
(Kanehisa et al., 2012) do not consider virus proteins at all. A
variety of software tools for orthology detection have been pro-
posed (Koonin, 2005), falling into four large groups (Kristensen
et al., 2010): phylogenetic tree-based approaches, heuristic best-
match methods, synteny-based and hybrid approaches. None
of the available tools such as EnsemblCompara (Vilella et al.,
2009), OrthoMCL (Li et al., 2003) or InParanoid (Alexeyenko
et al., 2006) have been speciﬁcally designed for Viral genome
analysis.

Remarkably, even the VOG data are rarely used for compara-
tive genomics of Viruses, despite their potential for studying the

natural history of viral genes (Koonin et al., 2006). So, what are
the problems with the currently available VOG? Three main
limitations are most evident: current VOG (i) are rarely updated
and are not hierarchical, (ii) lack remote and short homologs and
(iii) are not linked to their hosts and other cellular organisms.
A signiﬁcant fraction of current limitations in comparative
genomics of Viruses derives from the divergent sequences.
Analysis tools that include a broad analysis of compensatory
mutations of a wide range and conserved motifs for further inter-
actions do not exist and would result in higher computational
costs of the underlying calculations. Recently developed tools
such as Phamerator rely on fast, but even less sensitive,
approaches for sequence similarity calculations (Cresawn et al.,
2011). Considering the explosive growth of the genome data-
bases, such all-versus-all comparisons can be expected to
become even more crucial in the future. Efﬁcient approaches
such as incrementally calculated matrices of sequence similarities
(Arnold et al., 2005) are therefore promising tools for the next
generation of classiﬁcation systems for viral protein families.

5 VIRUS EVOLUTION AND PHYLOGENETICS

Phylogenetic analysis is a ubiquitous method in virology, form-
ing an essential element of investigations describing Viruses or
viral epidemiology. However, several characteristics of Viruses
pose speciﬁc challenges for phylogenetics: (i) strong differences
in evolution rates, typically high on a short-term and much lower
on the long-term, (ii) large potential for recombination and gene
transfer even between distant viruses or their host species, (iii)
often strong evolutionary relationships between Viruses and their
hosts, (iv) lack of physical ‘fossil records’ of Viruses and (V) abun-
dance of genomic ‘fossil records’ (Viral fossils) as parts of ancient
viral genomes that occur within the genomes of extant species.
Phylogenetic trees are the most widespread presentation for
virus phylogenies in the literature and several tree-building
methods and software exists [e.g. MrBayes (Ronquist and
Huelsenbeck, 2003), BEAST (Drummond et al., 2012),
Phyl oBayes (Lartillot et al., 2009), RAxML (Stamatakis et al.,
2008)]. However, trees cannot represent complex evolutionary
relations that are relevant for viruses as horizontal gene transfer,
interspeciﬁc recombination or the evolutionary relations between
Viruses and their hosts. Different types of phylogenetic networks
have been developed in recent years to represent such relations
(e.g. Huson et al., 2011). However, there is still much need
for research on how to reconstruct such aspects of virus

phylogeny.

5.1 Short-term viral evolution

The short-term evolution rates of many Viruses are so high that
genomic evolution can already be observed over the course of
years or even days. For analyzing Viral short-term sequence evo-
lution, it is important that the phylogenetic methods can include
the sampling dates of the sequences, such as TipDate
(Rambaut, 2000). Moreover, spatial dispersal processes play an
important role, e. g. the spatial distribution of a virus within the
host’s body or the geographic spread of an infectious disease.
Several methods and tools have been developed to analyze
and reconstruct the history of such complex phylogenetic and

phylogeographic processes [overviews are (Bloomquist et al.,
2010), (Faria et al., 2011) and (Lemey et al., 2009)]. Recent
tools that implement Bayesian approaches are based on
Markov chain models or continuous diffusion models
[BayArea (Landis et al., 2013), SPREAD (Bielejec et al., 2011)].
It is not easy to interpret whether the delivered phylogeographic
reconstructions and visualization tools, e. g. Phylowood (Landis
and Bedford, 2014), can help.

The evolutionary rates of Viruses can differ even for short-term
evolutionary scenarios, for example, between different lineages
(infectious, non-infectious) or between different time intervals
(e.g. states of an infection or seasons). One reason is that substi-
tution rates reﬂect a complex product of mutation rate, gener-
ation time, effective population size and ﬁtness (Jenkins et al.,
2002; Sanjuan et al., 2010). Vastly different replication proﬁles
[stamping machines versus geometric replication (Martinez et al.,
2011)] make the estimation of substitution rates difﬁcult. In
Viruses in particular, substitutions may also be an artifact
caused by polymerase errors and nucleotide modiﬁcations
(Domingo and Holland, 1997). For all these reasons, the classical
assumption of a time-homogeneous substitution process that is
used by several phylogenetic and phylogeographic statistical in-
ference methods does not hold and new approaches that can
include varying evolutionary rates have been proposed, such as
(Bielejec et al., 2013). Unfortunately, the computational effort of
such complex statistical inference methods is high. One remedy is
to use parallelized versions that could offer a dramatic speedup
on various parallel architectures, e. g. computer cluster (Baele and
Lemey, 2013), graphics processing units with BEAGLE (Ayres
et al., 2012) or multiple Field Programmable Gate Arrays via
extended BEAGLE (Jin and Bakos, 2013).

5.2 Viral ‘deep phylogeny’

Because physical fossils of Viruses do not exist, there is no direct
evidence about the time when viruses have emerged, and their
origin is still not clear. There is indication that Viruses are poly-
phyletic and several hypothesis exists about their relation to cel-
lular life (Wessner, 2010): (i) they might be precursors of cellular
life or (ii) they might have originated from cellular life via a
regressive, or reductive, process from whole cells or via a pro-
gressive process from genetic elements.

A problem for ‘deep phylogeny’ reconstruction is that the gen-
etic distance between Viruses can be so large that reasonable
alignments become impossible to calculate, and therefore, stand-
ard alignment-based phylogenetic methods cannot be applied.
The development of advanced approaches to achieve biologically
correct alignments would help, but can only marginally alleviate
the problem of saturated substitution processes. Other
approaches might be based on using aspects of genome organ-
ization or protein structures as phylogenetic characters (Holmes,
201 1).

However, some ancient Viruses have left parts of their genome
(or other traces) in the genome of germ line cells of their hosts.
Such parts, called endogenous viral elements (EVEs), have sur-
vived as non-functional, neutrally evolving pseudogenes or even
became ﬁxed as functional. Most EVEs stem from retroviruses
because they integrate into host genomes as part of their life
cycle. For example, ~8% of the human genome is derived

from >100 000 retroviral fossils (Lander et al., 2001). However,
in recent years, EVEs from many other Viruses have been found
(Horie and Tomonaga, 2011; Katzourakis and Gifford, 2010;
Patel et al., 2011). Some paleoviruses could even be almost en-
tirely reconstructed from EVEs. To detect EVEs in complete
genome sequences, different programs have been developed,
e.g. RepeatMasker (Smit et al., 2010), LTR_STRUC
(McCarthy and McDonald, 2003), RetroTector (Sperber
et al., 2009), and using a combination of several of them seems
most promising (Lerat, 2009).

Orthologues EVEs that are found in multiple host species in-
dicate a single integration event that happened before the diver-
gence of the host species group and therefore can be used to infer
the phylogeny of ancient Viruses and to calibrate the long-term
evolutionary timelines for viruses (Feschotte and Gilbert, 2012).
With EVEs it was possible to stretch back the history of several
RNA virus families [e.g. bornaviruses (Horie and Tomonaga,
2011)] over ~40 million years. This example shows that EVEs
might help to solve the following problem of RNA virus phylo-
genetic dating. Studies that are based on genomic sequences of
extant species often came to the conclusion that large taxonomic
units of Viruses (on the rank of genera) must have evolved from a
common ancestor several ten-thousand years ago, whereas there
are contrasting ideas based on virus—host coevolution over simi-
larly wide taxonomic entities, suggesting bifurcation ages in the
range of several millions of years (Buckling and Brockhurst,
2012; F raile and Garcia-Arenal, 2010; Marques and Carthew,
2007). However, in general, the calibration of phylogenies with
fossil dates is difﬁcult when the evolutionary rates are heterogen-
ous and new algorithmic methods have to be developed for this,
see (Heath et al., 2013).

5.3 Virus—host associations

Associations between Viruses and their hosts can have an import-
ant inﬂuence on the phylogeny of both partners. A divergence of
the host might lead to a divergence of the virus (codivergence)
and hence to a (local) congruence of both phylogenies. Such a
match of the virus phylogeny with host evolutionary events at
known dates can be used to calibrate the virus phylogeny or
corresponding molecular clocks (Sharp and Simmonds, 2011).
The property of Viruses to switch their hosts may enable Viruses
to replicate and spread much more efﬁciently, a process com-
monly referred to as an epidemic is observed in pathogenic
Viruses (Weiss, 2003). Owing to the advantages conferred by
the conquest of new host territory, some researchers assume
that host switching is an elementary component of virus evolu-
tion and might also initiate Viral speciation (Kitchen et al., 2011).

Because Virologists are highly interested to reconstruct the
common history of viruses and their hosts, several bioinformatics
tools have been developed for this purpose [for an overview see
(de Vienne et al., 2013; Doyon et al., 2011)]. A program for
testing of congruence between host phylogenies and parasite
phylogenies is ParaFit (Legendre et al., 2002). A fast imple-
mentation of ParaFit [AxParaf it (Stamatakis et al., 2007)] is
integrated via a wrapper in the tool CopyCat (Meier-Kolthoff
et al., 2007), which incorporates also a graphical user interface.
CopyCat was used, e. g. to investigate the codivergence between
mycoviruses and their hosts (G6ker et al., 2011).

RNA virus bioinformatics

 

Most programs for inferring reconciliations use a parsimony
criterion where a reconciliation of minimum total cost is sought
for. In this approach, a cost is given to each evolutionary event
type (e.g. codivergence or host switch) and the total cost of a
reconciliation is the sum of the costs of its events. The most often
used programs are CoRe—Pa (Merkle et al., 2010), Jane
(Conow et al., 2010) and TreeMap (Charleston and Page,
2002). An evaluation of the different reconciliation programs
using a new model for cophylogeny generation can be found in
(Keller-Schmidt et al., 2011). These programs have been used, for
example, to reconstruct the phylogenetic relationship between
orbiviruses (Dilcher et al., 2012), papillomaviruses (Gottschling
et al., 2011) or arenaviruses in Africa (Coulibaly—N’Golo et al.,
2011) and their respective hosts.

There are still many research problems and a need for new
bioinformatics methods that can, for example, include biogeo-
graphic information and ecological traits, preferential host
switching (Cuthill and Charleston, 2013) or different mutation
rates. A better knowledge of the timing and underlying condi-
tions of those processes could enable projections into the future
and thereby contribute to the tackling of one of the major issues
in today’s infectious diseases research, i.e. the prediction (and
prevention) of future pandemics and outbreaks.

6 MEDICAL AND BIOTECHNOLOGICAL
APPLICATIONS

Viral evolution has many implications for clinical virology.
Emergence of resistance mutations is among the biggest obstacles
to a successful antiviral therapy (Richman, 2006). The molecular
mechanisms selecting resistance mutations are complex, particu-
larly when multiple antiviral agents are used, e.g. for HIV
(Shibata et al., 2011). Computational analysis of HIV-1
genome variation correlating with CCR5 or CXCR4 coreceptors
led to AIDS therapy strategy (Lengauer et al., 2007).

Thus, new bioinformatics approaches to characterize viral evo-
lution both on an intra— and interindividual level would be an
important asset. A better understanding and knowledge of add-
itional selection mechanisms such as RNA secondary structures
could explain new pathways leading to resistance and immune
escape mutations. New sequence-based therapeutic concepts,
such as RNA interference, could prevent the selection of resist-
ance mutations (Schopman et al., 2012).

Previous work showed that the host immune system inﬂuences
the genetic variability in chronically infected individuals
(Hoffmann et al., 2008). This can be analyzed with population
genetic methods (Hoffmann et al., 2012). In this setting, viral
species acquire numerous mutations over time (Hoffmann

et al., 2010). An increasing number of immunocompromised pa-
tients susceptible to chronic infections represents an important
reservoir for new Viral genotypes (Siebenga et al., 2008).

By integrating bioinformatic methods, it might be possible to
predict Viral evolution in patients from their individual Viral
population, including lower prevalent individuals with single
genetic variations. Thus, the goal is to forecast the course of a
virus infection and adjust the treatment accordingly.

7 CONCLUDING REMARKS

RNA viruses pose a wide variety of challenges to computational
methodology owing to their staggering diversity, compact
genome organization and rapid rate of evolution. On the other
hand, the availability of large numbers of complete sequences
and the small to at most moderate size of RNA virus genomes
holds particular promises for specialized bioinformatics
approaches. The latter two characteristics are shared with
(animal) mitochondrial genomes. In contrast to viral sequences,
however, mitogenomes have attracted considerable interest in the
bioinformatics community, resulting in the development of a
wide array of specialized tools [reviewed (Bernt et al., 2012)].
This software often capitalizes on the fact that the small size of
the mitogenomes makes it possible to use much more expensive
algorithms than could be feasibly used in the context of prokary—
otic or even eukaryotic genomics. Given the many speciﬁc ques-
tions and importance of RNA Viruses in both basic research and
in medical sciences, it is hard to understand why the bioinfor-
matics community has shown little interest in developing a com-
prehensive suite of methods and tools for RNA virology. The
open problems remain many and diverse, ranging from orthol-
ogy detection, protein annotation and deep phylogeny to the
evaluation of multiple superimposed selection pressures, the
evolution of viral gene regulation and the understanding of
the rapidly evolving populations of Viruses and their arms race
with the host immune system.

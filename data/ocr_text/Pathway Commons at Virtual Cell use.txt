ABSTRACT

Summary: Pathway Commons is a resource permitting simultan-
eous queries of multiple pathway databases. However, there is no
standard mechanism for using these data (stored in BioPAX format)
to annotate and build quantitative mathematical models. Therefore, we
developed a new module within the virtual cell modeling and simula-
tion software. It provides pathway data retrieval and visualization and
enables automatic creation of executable network models directly
from qualitative connections between pathway nodes.

Availability and implementation: Available at Virtual Cell (http://
vcell.org/). Application runs on all major platforms and does not require
registration for use on the user’s computer. Tutorials and video are
available at user guide page.

1 INTRODUCTION

The Pathway Commons collection of databases (Cerami et al.,
2011) provides access to >442 000 interactions among 86000
physical entities. The data are retrieved in the form of
Biological PAthway eXchange, BioPAX (Demir et al., 2010)
that can be converted to the Systems Biology Markup
Language, SBML (Hucka et al., 2003)—the gold standard for
exchanging mathematical models and the native standard for the
Biomodels model database (Le Novere et al., 2006). However,
while converting to SBML, the wealth of information in anno-
tations is often lost because the semantics of general biological
knowledge differs from that of mathematical models
(Ruebenacker et al., 2009).

Here we describe a tool that allows users to access the rich
trove of pathway data available through Pathway Commons and
use it to build well-annotated mathematical models. It was im-
plemented in the Virtual Cell (VCell) modeling and simulation
framework (Cowan et al., 2012; Moraru et al., 2008), a platform
designed for building and simulating compartmental and spatial
models and analysis of simulation results. The VCell database
contains >54 000 user models of which ~500 are public.
However, most of these models were created ‘ad-hoc’, using mul-
tiple iterations. In doing so, users rarely used detailed names to
identify variables and functions in the mathematical model, but

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed

most often used simplified abbreviations like R, ATP or even
arbitrary symbols such as $1, P1 and so forth. As a result, in the
absence of extensive accompanying documentation, a model is
often difﬁcult or even impossible to understand by anyone except
for the model author(s). As models increase in complexity, shar-
ing and reusing models and components become a necessity, and
creating a well-annotated model is essential. For this purpose,
Minimal Information Required In the Annotation of Models
(MIRIAM) community standard was developed (Le Novere
et al., 2005). Our software facilitates this by linking every
model element to extensive documentation coming from path-
way databases, helping researchers to produce models that are
easier to understand and shared with the community.

The tool stores connectivity information derived from path-
way interactions and can convert it into a reaction network in
VCell, which can then be populated with rate constants and ini-
tial concentrations to generate kinetic simulations, which is a
useful feature for researchers learning how to model. Online tu-
torials describe simple ways to create a simulation-ready quali-
tative model of a complete pathway. We also expect the tool to
be appealing to bioinformaticians as a browser and editor for
data in Pathway Commons. We hope that the ease of creating
computational models to use pathway data can bring together
researchers doing mathematical modeling, biologists working
with pathway data and bioinformaticians querying and visualiz-
ing it.

2 LINKING PATHWAYS AND MODELS

2.1 Accessing and linking pathway data to existing models

The new Pathway Commons at VCell interface allows users to
search pathway data from inside VCell (Fig. 1, panel A). The
entries of interest can be imported and stored alongside a VCell
model as a Pathway Model to be available whenever necessary
(panel B). The pathway data can be searched, filtered and viewed
as a diagram or as a list of objects (panel C). Each entry in a
Pathway Model includes a list of identifiers from different data-
bases with clickable web links that lead to relevant entries in any
of these databases (panel D). While working on an existing VCell
model, a user can create a relevant Pathway Model and link it to
entities in the VCell Reaction Diagram (panel F) to fully annotate
the appropriate elements of the mathematical system (panel E).
All such linked elements are marked with the letter L in both the
Pathway Diagram and the Reaction Diagram (panel A).

Fig. 1. Pathway Commons at VCell. The Pathway database panel (A)
allows the user to search Pathway Commons and select pathways for
bringing into VCell. The Pathway preview panel (B) allows the user to
import elements of the selected pathway into VCell. The Pathway view
panel (C) allows the user to see multiple views of imported pathway data,
to select elements to inspect in the Object properties panel (D) and to
convert into VCell model elements (E). Selecting an item under Pathway
in the navigation panel (F) will open the corresponding tab in the view
panel (C)

2.2 Creating new models from pathway data

Selected physical entities and physical interactions from path-
ways can be automatically converted into VCell species and re-
actions in a Reaction Diagram. The default location of newly
created species is in a single compartment and the default stoi-
chiometries in newly created reactions are set to 1, as these types
of information are often missing in the pathway databases. Users
can then define multiple compartments and change reaction
properties. Reaction kinetics defaults to mass action, but any
kinetic formalism and rate laws can be specified. The new
VCell model is fully annotated providing all available informa-
tion about this element coming from multiple databases (Fig. 1,
bottom right panel). Once all the initial concentrations (or copy
numbers for stochastic simulations), rate constants and cellular
geometry parameters are specified, the model can be sent to the
appropriate VCell simulator to provide time courses
computation.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

The format for VCell model representation is the VCell Markup
Language (VCML), an XML dialect that has some similarities to
SBML. Pathway Commons provides data in BioPAX format
(Demir et al., 2010), which is an Resource Description
Framework (RDF)-based ontology. As we pointed out earlier
(Ruebenacker et al., 2009), BioPAX data are not fully

compatible with XML-based modeling formats, and converting
BioPAX data to annotated SBML or VCML will lead to data
loss and distortion (Ruebenacker et al., 2009). Previously, we
developed an intermediate representation in the form of the
SBPAX ontology (Ruebenacker et al., 2009), which is an
RDF/OWL schema that provides mapping of pathway entities
to model elements. The first version of a BioPAX to model con-
verter was implemented as a standalone software tool, SyBil
(Ruebenacker and Blinov, 2011). This was then ported and inte-
grated into core functionality of the client-server VCell platform.

We introduced two new components to VCML—the Pathway
Model and the Relationship Model. These permit unambiguous
storage of the complete extracted BioPAX data, without any loss
that may be caused by translation, and the mapping of the path-
way elements to VCell Model entities.

The Pathway Model contains all data that was extracted from
Pathway Commons during model generation. Some of it can be
linked to BioModel elements, but the user may keep unlinked
data in the Pathway Model for future use. Pathway Commons
currently supplies the data in BioPAX Level 2 format, but we
already support importing data in Level 3 format. Sesame open-
source framework is used for querying and analyzing these RDF
data. It allows for generating Java source files from ontologies
and use of SPARQL to query RDF. Java objects were created
for all BioPAX Level 3 classes, with conversion from Level 2
done internally. The Pathway model is stored inside VCML as
RDF annotations under the top level element. Use of RDF
allows for seamless incorporation of pathway data coming
from multiple sources. To operate on Pathway Model compo-
nents, we implemented BioPAX I/O operations as new Java
classes in VCell.

The Relationship Model is a new element of the VCML schema
that links elements of VCell BioModel (species and reactions) to
elements in the Pathway Model (physical entities and inter-
actions). The mapping is many-to-many, so several pathway ob-
jects can be linked to a single model element and vice versa.
Linked pathway entities have unique identities through the
CPATH ID (the identifier assigned by Pathway Commons),
and we store and display all Uniﬁcatioanef IDs for reuse in
different models.

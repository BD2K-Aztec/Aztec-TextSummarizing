ABSTRACT

Motivation: The anatomy of model species is described in
ontologies, which are used to standardize the annotations of
experimental data, such as gene expression patterns. To compare
such data between species, we need to establish relations between
ontologies describing different species.

Results: We present a new algorithm, and its implementation in the
software Homolonto, to create new relationships between anatomical
ontologies, based on the homology concept. Homolonto uses a
supervised ontology alignment approach. Several alignments can be
merged, forming homology groups. We also present an algorithm
to generate relationships between these homology groups. This has
been used to build a multi-species ontology, for the database of gene
expression evolution Bgee.

1 INTRODUCTION

Databases dedicated to model species rely on the usage of
ontologies, for example the zebraﬁsh anatomy for ZFIN (Sprague
et al., 2006), or the Mouse gross anatomy and development
(B aldock et al., 2003). Such ontologies of anatomy and development
facilitate the organization of functional data pertaining to a species.
For example, all gene expression patterns described in ZFIN are
annotated using the zebraﬁsh anatomical ontology. A list of such
ontologies is kept on the Open Biomedical Ontologies (OBO)
website (Smith et al., 2007).

To pool the experimental data from different model species,
we need to encode corresponding information between ontologies
which describe different anatomies (e.g. zebraﬁsh and human).
For example, we are interested in integrating and comparing gene
expression patterns between several species (Bastian et al., 2008).
The most widely accepted criterion to make such comparisons in
biology is homology (Hall, 1994; Hossfeld and Olsson, 2005). When
we compare two elements, whether or not they are derived from
the same ancestral element deﬁnes our expectation of similarity

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

between them, and the interpretation of differences. For example, if
a chicken wing is not homologous to a ﬂy wing, we do not expect
the same underlying structures, and similarities can be attributed to
functional convergence. Whereas the chicken wing is homologous
(as a limb) to the human arm, thus we do expect the same underlying
structures, and differences can be attributed to divergent evolution.
There are different deﬁnitions of homology (Roux and Robinson—
Rechavi, 2010), and our algorithm does not in itself impose one on
the user. We do recommend choosing an explicit deﬁnition and using
it consistently throughout the analysis.

In practice, hundreds of terms must be compared between
ontologies that may differ both in the actual biology modeled (i.e.
a ﬁsh is not a mammal) and in the representation used. Although
a purely manual annotation of homologies is possible, it would
be too time consuming to be done for all terms between several
divergent species. Kruger et al. (2007) have used a manual approach
to ﬁnd similarities between simpliﬁed anatomy ontologies for human
and mouse. As both are mammals, they share most structures and
terminology. There are also on—going efforts to integrate anatomical
ontologies (Haendel et al., 2008; Washington at al., 2009), which
are often geared towards the comparison of phenotypes (Lussier and
Li, 2004). As far as we know, the question of using homology to
align anatomical ontologies has never been explicitly addressed.

Since the problem is to ﬁnd correspondences between the
concepts of two ontologies, we draw on methods from ‘schema
matching’, or ‘ontology alignment’ (Euzenat and Shvaiko, 2007;
Lambrix and He, 2008). As opposed to more generalist solutions,
we present a algorithm which is specialized in the alignment of
anatomical ontologies. The speciﬁcities of these ontologies include
high redundancy of terms, and few types of relations. Finally, a
speciﬁc issue is that structures which have the same name and are
related to similar concepts may not be homologous. This is the case
of the insect eye and the mammalian eye. While some underlying
molecular mechanisms are similar, these structures evolved
independently and are not considered homologous (discussed in
Hall, 1994; Shubin et al., 2009). Unsupervised alignment algorithms
would misleadingly align such similarities; this is for instance the
case for the LOOM software used on the NCBO portal (Ghazvinian
et al., 2009).

In principle, an alignment algorithm should aim at ﬁnding the
largest number of true positives, while avoiding false positives. In
practice, our experience is that the size and structure of anatomical
ontologies leads to very large numbers of false positives if a naive
approach is taken (i.e. common words). Thus, the basic aim of
Homolonto is to propose in priority to the user the best candidate

pairs of homologs, and avoid the need to consider many irrelevant
pairs.

2 SYSTEMS AND METHODS

Homolonto is implemented in Java. Ontologies are read in the OBO format
(Smith et al., 2007). Homolonto is freely available in the download section
of the B gee website (http://bgee.unil.ch/).

3 ALGORITHM
3.1 Principle

Ontology alignment is the process of determining correspondences
between ontology concepts. We present our approach based on the
classiﬁcation of ontology matching systems proposed by Euzenat
and Shvaiko (2007; Shvaiko and Euzenat, 2005).

Biological ontologies simplify some aspects relative to the general
case. The types of concepts (e.g. anatomical structures) and the
relationships (e. g. part_0f) are known in advance, and known to be
common between the ontologies to align. Moreover, in the present
implementation we only seek to establish one type of relation,
homology.

Our algorithm can be described as a composite system (Fig. 1),
using: (i) language—based comparison of names with tokenization
(element level, syntactic technique); (ii) graph—based matching of
children of elements (structure level, syntactic technique); (iii) data
analysis, e.g. statistics on word occurrence (structure level, syntactic
technique); (iv) external input from the user (element level, external
technique; classiﬁcation following Euzenat and Shvaiko, 2007).
We combine the results in parallel, as opposed to in sequence, by
using a sum of scores from different techniques. Thus, we make
use both of schema and element level information. The algorithm
produced in a ﬁrst step anchors at the element level, generated
by language technique, and potentially by the user (external), then
uses information from the schema, the elements, and user input, to
improve the alignment based on these anchors.

Importantly, each proposition of homology between elements
must be validated by the user (external input), to take into account

original pairings, and to validate propositions.

such cases as the eye, discussed in the ‘Introduction’ section. Thus
our process is a supervised one.

Finally, we note that the alignment we obtain is of the form many
to many, not one to one.

3.2 Deﬁnitions

A central concept in our algorithm is that of a ‘proposition’ (similar
to ‘suggestion’ in Lambrix and He, 2008). A proposition is a pair
of terms (also called ‘class’ in OWL) from the two ontologies for
which a score has been computed. This may have been done based
on homonymy (common words) of the term names (also called ‘class
label’ in OWL), or propagation through the ontology. It is important
to note (i) that not all possible propositions (i.e. pairs of terms) are
created during the alignment, and (ii) that the list of propositions
evolves during iterations of the algorithm.

For performance, our algorithm is not symmetric. Propositions
are managed relative to one ontology, ‘to align’, which is being
aligned to the ‘reference ontology’ (the one loaded ﬁrst by the user).
This allows us to store explicitly the information that term A of the
ontology to align has two propositions, with term X and with term
Y, of the reference ontology. If X has propositions not only with A
but also with B of the ontology to align, this will not be taken into
account explicitly.

3.3 Algorithm

(1) Computing word speciﬁc scores: score modiﬁers are computed
for all words of the ontologies being aligned. Each word present at
least once in both ontologies being aligned (01 and Oz) is given a
score modiﬁer based on its number of occurrences f (word, O):

Mod(word,O,-)= l/(l—l—loglO(f(word,O,-))) (l)
Mod(word) = Mod(word, 01 ) >l< Mod(word, O2) (2)

(2) Starting list of propositions (P in Fig. l): to initialize the
algorithm we deﬁne ﬁrst obvious similarities between the terms
of the ontologies to align. Based on the assumption that two
structures that have the same name are likely homologous, the initial
propositions are formed of terms with identical names. For example,
‘optic cup’ of ZFA (zebraﬁsh, Table l) and ‘optic cup’ of EHDAA
(human, Table 1) will form a proposition. But ‘ventricle’ and ‘cardiac
ventricle’ will not. In this process, we also consider the synonym
ﬁeld of the terms. For example the ZFA term ‘melanocyte’ (synonym
‘melanophore’) will form a proposition with the term ‘melanophore’
(synonym ‘melanocyte’) from XAO (Xenopus, Table 1).

Each pair of names n1, n2, is given a base score, dependent on
the words shared:

Base_score(n1 , n2) 2

base_homonymy_score >l< max (Mod(word)) >l< |n1 (1 n2 |

 

(3)
max(lnil,ln2|)

where |n| is the number of words in n, lnl ﬂnzl is the number of
words shared by ml and ng, and max(Mod(word)) is computed
over all shared words. In the starting list, |nlﬂn2|=|n1|=|n2|
by deﬁnition, but this is not the case at further iterations of the
algorithm.

The comparison of terms names is intentionally quite basic,
and does not take advantage of, e.g. etymology of words. In our
experience, terms names used in anatomical ontologies are similar

enough that more sophisticated approaches generate too many false
positives, without improving the recovery of true positives.

(3) Initial propagation step: the score of these propositions
is propagated between neighbors. This initial propagation is
bidirectional, and limited to already deﬁned propositions. For
example, the score of the ‘optic cup’ pair is added to the score of the
‘eye’ pair, as ‘optic cup’ is part of ‘eye’, and both pairs are initial
propositions. Symmetrically the score of the ‘eye’ pair is added to
the ‘optic cup’ pair. But the score of ‘eye’ is not propagated to e.g.
the pairing of ‘visual system’ (ZFA parent of ‘eye’) with ‘sensory
organ’ (EHDAA parent of ‘eye’), because this pair is not an initial
proposition. The aim of this step is to increase the score of the most
likely homologs (resulting in P’ in Fig. 1).

(4) Cleaning the initial proposition list: the design of some ontologies
may generate many false positives, typically through repetition of
the same name as a child of diverse structures (e. g. 76 occurrences of
‘mesenchyme’ in EHDAA). To avoid this, if a term is a member of
several propositions with different scores, we initially keep only the
best scoring proposition. If there are more than ﬁve highest scoring
propositions for a given term, the algorithm removes all propositions
for this term.

(5) Evaluation step: each proposition is presented to the user,
in descending order of scores. The user has four options for
each proposition: (i) validation as homology; this excludes further
pairings of the form sibling of term A with term B, or A with
sibling of B. (ii) Validation as ‘partial homology’; this allows further
pairing of siblings of A with B, or of A with siblings of B. These
may be due to differences in ontology representation. This is also
useful to manage serial homology: all somites may be deﬁned as
homologous inside one individual. (iii) Invalidation. (iv) Delay
decision concerning this proposition.

The user may chose to evaluate any number of propositions before
provoking the computation step. It is recommended in most cases
to proceed to computation (‘iterate’ in the graphical user interface,
GUI) after every decision.

(6) Computation step: if one of the terms of a validated pair is
already a member of an homology group, then the other term is
added to the homology group. Otherwise, a new homology group
is created, containing both terms of the validated pair (H in Fig. 1).
The information of homology is propagated through the hierarchy by
the use of a validated homology score (Equation 4). The underlying
idea is that if two terms A and B are homologous, then one of the

children of A is probably homologous to one of the children of B.
During the propagation the validated homology score is added to
the base score (Equation 3) of pairs of terms:

Propagated_score(a, b) =

validated_homology_score >l< (max_depth —l— 1 — present_depth)
(max_depth —l— 1)

 

(4)

Total_score(a, b) =Propagated_score(a, b) (5 )
a
-l- Base_score(na , 11;)

where na is the name of term a. In the present implementation, the
propagation depth is 1, and the validated homology score is 1.5
times the base homonymy score. For pairs of terms which are not
yet a proposition, a new proposition is created, and the base score is
computed. This will include cases of partial homonymy, for which
Equation 3 down weights names which share a lower proportion of
words. Pairs which have been previously invalidated by the user will
not receive a propagated score, and will remain invalidated.

To down weight potential false positives due to validation of terms
with many children, the propagated score is reduced proportionally
to the number of new propositions for each term of the ontology to
align (Equation 5b).

Total_score(a, bi) =

Propagated_score(a, bi) (513)
B , '
(|b|+1)*2 -l- ase_score(na nbl)

 

where a is a term of the ontology to align, b ,- is a term of the reference
ontology, and |b| is the number of new propositions for term a. When
a proposition (a, b,) is invalidated, |b| is updated, and the Total
score(a, bi) increases for the remaining propositions.

When the terms of an invalidated proposition share common
words, then the score modiﬁers of all shared words is diminished
(Equation 6). As this is repeated, words which tend to generate false
positives will be increasingly down weighted.

Mod(word) = Mod(word) >l< 0.9 (6)

(7) Iteration: evaluation of propositions (Step 5), ordered by total
score (base score + propagated score), and computation (Step 6), is
repeated until the user decides to terminate, or no more propositions
are generated (resulting in the alignment A in Fig. 1).

4 IMPLEMENTATION AND GUI

Homolonto displays the input OBO ontologies under a tree
representation form. The user may browse the ontology, and a basic
‘ﬁnd’ tool has been implemented. Before starting the alignment
algorithm, the user has the possibility to manually specify homology
relations. This allows potential anchoring of structures with very
different names between species, based on known biology (e.g. limb
and ﬁn). Once the alignment algorithm is run, a new window opens
and displays the best propositions, one at a time, in order of score.
For each term of a proposition, the parents are shown for two levels,
to help the decision. Clicking on a term identiﬁer opens the ﬁrst
occurrence of that term in the ontology browser window, where the
user can check for more information (e. g. synonyms, develops_from
relations). Decisions can be annotated with comments and with a

link, similar to the ‘dbxref’ ﬁeld of OBO—Edit (Day—Richter et al.,
2007).

To facilitate alignment of large ontologies, keyboard shortcuts are
implemented for the most common decisions: enter key = validation
as homology plus computation and iteration; escape key = invalidate
plus computation and iteration; right and left arrows to see the next
and previous propositions without computation.

When several pairwise alignments have been conducted,
Homolonto offers a function to reconcile them, if they share a
common ontology. Thus if both pairs human and mouse, and human
and zebraﬁsh, have been aligned, the triplets human — mouse —
zebraﬁsh are created. This means that the number of propositions
to validate does not need to increase in O(N2). Rather, each new
ontology must be fully aligned to only one already aligned ontology,
then the missing homologies must be informed. A judicious choice
of the initial pairwise alignment should minimize these missing
homologies.

5 RELATIONSHIPS BETWEEN HOMOLOGY
GROUPS

Homolonto is used to generate pairwise homology relationships
between anatomical ontologies. As homology relationships are
transitive, Homolonto offers the option to merge these pairwise
alignments into homologous organs groups (HOGs). This generates
both the HOGs, and the mapping of species—speciﬁc anatomical
structures to these HOGs. HOGs then need to be structured as an
ontology to allow reasoning on them. This means that, at a minimum,
relationships amongst them have to be designed. Another algorithm
has thus been developed to infer relationships between HOGs.

(1) Initial Step: all possible paths between HOGs are retrieved.
For instance, if an anatomical structure ‘a’, mapped to the HOG
‘A’, has a part_0f relationship to the anatomical structure ‘b’,
mapped to the HOG ‘B’, then a putative part_0f relationship
is deﬁned between HOGs ‘A’ and ‘B’. Relationships between
HOGs are often indirect (e.g. structure ‘a’, mapped to HOG ‘A’,
part_0f structure ‘0’, part_0f structure ‘b’, mapped to HOG ‘B’).
If the ﬁrst relation (the relation ‘outgoing’ from the child HOG
‘A’ in the previous example) and the last relation (the relation
‘incoming’ to the parent HOG, ‘B’ in the previous example) are
of the same type (e. g. part_0f, is_a), then the putative relationship
is deﬁned as this type. Otherwise, the relationship is deﬁned as the
SKOS type broader_than (http2//www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD—skos—
reference—200808290.

(2) Skipping relations from non—trusted ontologies: some
ontologies do not follow the OBO principles, and implement for
instance only one type of relation amongst all concepts [e.g. EV
(Kelso et al., 2003) only uses is_a relationships]. The user may
choose to not use these ontologies to deﬁne relation types. All the
putative relations inferred by these ontologies at Step 1 are then set
as broader_than. But the ﬁnal relation type between these HOGs
can still be inferred thanks to other ontologies.

(3) Skipping relations deﬁned by too few ontologies: if the
proportion of ontologies deﬁning a relation, compared to the total
number of ontologies involved in the creation of the HOGs, is
below a threshold deﬁned by the user (‘ontology coverage’), then
the relation is deﬁned to the type broader_than, and the algorithm
stops examining relations between these HOGs.

(4) Deﬁning within—ontology agreement: several anatomical
structures from the same ontology can belong to the same HOG
This can generate a within—ontology conﬂict for deﬁning a relation
type. For instance, structures ‘a’ and ‘b’ allow to deﬁne a putative
part_0f relationship between HOGs ‘A’ and ‘B’, while structures
‘a’ ’ and ‘b’ ’, belonging to the same ontology, deﬁne a putative is_a
relationship between these HOGs. The algorithm then calculates,
for each relation type, the proportion that the number of paths
deﬁning this relation type represents, compared to the total number
of paths between these two HOGs for this ontology. If, for a type,
this proportion exceeds a threshold (‘within—ontology agreement’),
deﬁned by the user and at least >0.5, then this relation type is
attributed for this ontology between these HOGs. Otherwise, the
relation is deﬁned to the type broader_than for this ontology.

(5) Deﬁning inter—ontology agreement: different ontologies can
deﬁne different relation types between two related HOGs. This
conﬂict is resolved in the same way as at Step 4, by using a threshold
(‘inter—ontology agreement’), deﬁned by the user and at least >05.

(6) Removing cyclic relationships: by inferring automatically the
relationships between HOGs, cycles may be generated (e.g. HOG
‘A’ part_0f HOG ‘B’ part_0f HOG ‘A’), whereas an ontology has
to be acyclic. If such cycles are detected, the algorithm stops with
an error message prompting the user to make a decision: the user
has then to manually remove one of the involved relationships.

(7) Removing redundancies: if several relationships are
redundant, only the deepest relationship is conserved; for instance,
if a HOG ‘A’ has two substructures by a part_0f relationship, ‘B’
and ‘C’, and if ‘C’ is also a substructure of ‘B’, then the direct
relationship between the HOGs ‘A’ and ‘C’ is removed.

(8) Curation step: a curator can then manually review the
broader_than relations, to attribute them to a type deﬁned by
the OBO Relation Ontology (Smith et al., 2005). Some custom
relationships, not inferred by the algorithm, can also be added at
this step.

6 RESULTS

To date, the use of Homolonto, followed by a curation process, has
allowed to deﬁne 1002 HOGs, involving 4459 structures from seven
anatomical ontologies: ZFA (Sprague et al., 2006), EHDAA (Aitken,
2005; Hunter et al., 2003), EV (Kelso et al., 2003), EMAPA (Aitken,
2005; Hunter et al., 2003), MA (Smith et al., 2007), XAO (Bowes
et al., 2008) and FBbt (Grumbling et al., 2006). The algorithm
to design relationships amongst the HOGs inferred 1411 relations.
With the most stringent parameters (ontology coverage = 1, within—
ontology agreement = 1, inter—ontology agreement: 1), 222 of them
were deﬁned automatically as part_0f, 15 as is_a, all the others
as broader_than. After curation, there are 1179 part_0f and 232
is_a relations. The resulting alignments are used in the database
B gee (Bastian et al., 2008). Thus an important result is that we have
been able to implement in a practical manner anatomical homology
relationships.

Here, we present, in more detail, two alignments (Table 1): ﬁrst,
zebraﬁsh/Xenopus, which illustrates a best case scenario of two
consistent ontologies, conforming to the CARO standards (Haendel
et al., 2008), with annotations of synonyms and deﬁnitions, and
low redundancy. On the other hand, Xenopus (a frog) and zebraﬁsh
(a ray—ﬁnned ﬁsh) present important differences in anatomy. And
second, human/mouse which, despite the similarity in anatomy,

illustrates a more difﬁcult scenario of large ontologies, with issues
such as repetition of names (76 occurrences of ‘mesenchyme’
in human, 93 in mouse), due to splitting of concepts among
morphological structures or among developmental stages.

The main observation is that our algorithm is successful at
ordering propositions. In the ‘easy’ case of zebraﬁsh/Xenopus
(Supplementary Figs S1 and S2), there are only seven invalidated
propositions in the ﬁrst 150 (95% validation). This is followed
by a relatively short interval of iterations where validated and
invalidated propositions are mixed: 46% of validations between
iterations 151 and 200, and 20% between 201 and 250. Further
iterations generate mostly invalidated propositions (3% validation
from 251 to 735). Thus, 93% of all validations occurred in the
ﬁrst 250 iterations. Looking in more detail, the ﬁrst propositions
are terms which share many children. Thus, the ﬁrst proposition
pairs ‘organism subdivision’ from each ontology, which share four
children with identical names (‘head’, ‘trunk’, ‘tail’ and ‘surface
structure’). The second proposition pairs two terms which have
different names, but are identiﬁed readily thanks to their synonyms:
XAO:0000023 ‘skin’, synonym ‘integument’ and ZFA20000368
‘integument’, synonym ‘skin’ (IDs correspond to the versions
used for the alignment; Table 1). The ﬁrst invalidated proposition
(iteration 77) has a peculiar status, since both ontologies include
a term ‘unspeciﬁed’, which are equivalent but cannot be deﬁned
as homologous. The next invalidated proposition (iteration 130) is
between XAO:0000313 ‘head somite’ and ZFA20001462 ‘somite
border’. Indeed, early in the iterations, sharing a parent ‘somite’
plus sharing the word ‘somite’ brings a relatively high score. But
since propositions based on this are usually invalidated, the word
‘somite’ loses weight (Equation 6), and further propositions based
on this similarity receive lower scores. Thus, whereas there are
in principle 24 possible propositions between the Xenopus and
zebraﬁsh ontologies based on ‘somite’, only 13 were considered
in this very thorough alignment (including the validated pair
XAO:0000058 ‘somite’—ZFA20000155 ‘somite’). At the other
extreme of the alignment, the last validated propositions (iterations
607—610) concern aortic arches which were named, e.g. ‘aortic arch
4’ in zebraﬁsh, but ‘fourth aortic arch’ in Xenopus. Their low scores
were due to the high frequency of the words ‘aortic’ and ‘arch’ in
both ontologies (Table 2).

The pattern is similar for the human/mouse alignment
(Supplementary Fig. S3). In the ﬁrst 1400 iterations, 99% of
propositions are validated. In the next 600 iterations, the ﬁgure
reduces to 63%, and in the last 962 iterations it falls to 21%.
This slower decrease illustrates the complexity of this alignment.
Although 2962 iterations may seem large, three points should
be noted: (i) this is a worst case scenario, aligning two large
anatomical ontologies, which lack important information such as
deﬁnitions and synonyms, and are not up to recent standards
(Haendel et al., 2008). (ii) This represents in our experience only
15 person—days of work, which means an iteration takes on average
2—3 min (on a Dual—core processor at 2.66 GHz, with 2Go of DDR2
memory). This is possible because many answers are obvious
to the annotator in context of the information provided by the
graphical user interface. For example, while the term EMAPA: 18280
‘intrinsic’ may appear enigmatic, its part_0f relationship to ‘skeletal
muscle’ part_0f ‘tongue’, makes its homology to EHDAA29140
‘intrinsic muscle’ part_0f ‘skeletal muscle’ part_0f ‘tongue’
clear. Conversely, EMAPA216370 ‘cardiovascular system’ part_0f

(Table 2). (iii) The 2962 propositions evaluated represents much
less than the 8 202 675 possible pairs of terms between these two
ontologies (2327 X 3525; Table 1). The validation rate of 66%
shows that these were mostly propositions worth considering, and
that the time spent was indeed due to the size of the ontologies,
not to a default in the algorithm. Results also show that manual
expertise is necessary, since even in the high scoring propositions
some are invalid (Table 2). The example of ‘cardiovascular system’
(EMAPA216370/EHDAA2394) given above appears at iteration 416,
with a score improved by shared subcomponents (‘venous system’
and ‘arterial system’). Overall, 27% of invalidations are pairs of
terms with identical names. Interestingly, Homolonto manages to

give these misleading homonyms low priority: homonyms within
the ﬁrst 1000 iterations have a 99% chance of being homologs,
whereas homonyms within the last 1000 iterations only have a 19%
chance of being homologs. Thus, 93% of invalidated homonyms
appear after iteration 1400.

It is also of interest to consider the capacity of Homolonto to
recover homologous terms which are not described by the same
name, in a case such as human/mouse where synonyms are not
available. Of the 1959 validated homologs, 17% do not have
identical names. Many of these share partial homonymy, as between
EMAPA217865 ‘bulbo—ventricular region’ and EHDAA2766 ‘bulbo—
ventricular groove’. Such propositions will be recovered by the
combination of word matching and propagation of other validated
homology relationships (i.e. both are part_of ‘heart’). Structural
matching is also able to recover cases with no word matching,
as in EMAPA216211 ‘cardiac muscle’lEHDAA2430 ‘myocardium’.
In this case, both terms are part_of ‘early primitive heart tube’.
In both ontologies, the latter term has two other children, which
are homonyms and homologs: ‘endocardial tube’ and ‘cardiac
jelly’. When the homonymous terms have been validated, ‘cardiac
muscle’ and ‘myocardium’ remain the only pair of children
of ‘early primitive heart tube’, which permits their pairing
as a reasonable proposition, following Equation 5b. Similarly,
XAO:0003033 ‘nostril’ and ZFA20000550 ‘naris’ are correctly
identiﬁed as homologs, since both have is_a relations to ‘surface
structure’, and part_of ‘head’.

7 DISCUSSION

The main feature of Homolonto is its efﬁciency in identifying and
ranking valid pairs of terms. Although most homologies concern
terms with the same name, the algorithm is successful both in
generating relevant propositions for terms with different names,
and in ranking poorly terms with the same name which are not
homologs. The algorithm has been shown to perform well in
proposing valid pairs of homologous terms for two quite different
cases. Zebraﬁsh and Xenopus have divergent anatomies, from the
two major branches of vertebrates (ray—ﬁnned ﬁshes and tetrapodes),
but are described by ontologies which follow consistent guidelines
(Haendel et al., 2008). The Xenopus ontology is also relatively
small. Conversely, human and mouse have very similar anatomies
(both are mammals), but are described by large ontologies with
little structured information. Despite these differences, the results
of Homolonto are consistent, proposing almost exclusively valid
pairs in a ﬁrst series of iterations covering approximately half of
the smaller ontology: 250 iterations for Xenopus/zebraﬁsh, 1400
iterations for human/mouse.

The size of some biological ontologies makes the user interface
important. The GUI of Homolonto provides rapid access to
information about the terms considered, and includes keyboard
shortcuts. The combination of an algorithm which proposes relevant
pairs of terms, and of this GUI, allows the alignment of large
ontologies of anatomy in reasonable time (i.e. weeks).

As all propositions have to be manually validated, the expertise
of the curator is important to consider. In our experience, most
propositions between closely related species represent ‘text—book’
knowledge, that do not require the curator to be an anatomy expert
(although she/he needs to be a biologist). On the other hand, when
dealing with complex structures (e. g. substructures of the brain) or

distant species (e. g. alignment of insect and vertebrate anatomies),
such an expertise might be needed.

Future development of Homolonto should include more
relationships than simple homology. For example, homoplasy
(analogy in the common sense of the word) may be relevant in cases
of functional equivalence, such as the vertebrate and insect eyes.
Also, it would be of interest to model explicitly serial homology, to
improve the management of e. g. somites.

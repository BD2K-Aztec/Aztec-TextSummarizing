Abstract

Motivation: Viruses, from the human protein—protein interaction network perspective, target hubs,
bottlenecks and interconnected nodes enriched in certain biological pathways. However, not much
is known about the general characteristic features of the human proteins interacting with viral
proteins (referred to as hVIPs) as well as the motifs and domains utilized by human-virus protein—-
protein interactions (referred to as Hu-Vir PPls).

Results: Our study has revealed that hVIPs are mostly disordered proteins, whereas viral proteins
are mostly ordered proteins. Protein disorder in viral proteins and hVIPs varies from one subcellular
location to another. In any given viral-human PPI pair, at least one of the two proteins is structurally
disordered suggesting that disorder associated conformational flexibility as one of the characteristic
features of virus—host interaction. Further analyses reveal that hVIPs are (i) slowly evolving proteins,
(ii) associated with high centrality scores in human-PPI network, (iii) involved in multiple pathways,
(iv) enriched in eukaryotic linear motifs (ELMs) associated with protein modification, degradation and
regulatory processes, (v) associated with high number of splice variants and (vi) expressed abun-
dantly across multiple tissues. These aforementioned findings suggest that conformational flexibility,
spatial diversity, abundance and slow evolution are the characteristic features of the human proteins
targeted by viral proteins. Hu-Vir PPIs are mostly mediated via domain—motif interactions (DMls)
where viral proteins employ motifs that mimic host ELMs to bind to domains in human proteins.
DMIs are shared among viruses belonging to different families indicating a possible convergent evo-
lution of these motifs to help viruses to adopt common strategies to subvert host cellular pathways.

1 Introduction

Viruses are the obligate intracellular parasites and hence need host
cellular machinery for their genome replication and propagation
enabled by interactions between Viral and several host proteins
during various stages of Viral infection. Hence, Viral-host protein—-
protein interactions have been keenly studied by employing both

computational (Dyer et al., 2008; Meyniel-Schicklin et al., 2012;
Navratil et al., 2011; Wuchty et al., 2010) and experimental
(Calderwood et al., 2007; de Chassey et al., 2008; Jager et al., 2012;
Khadka et al., 2011; Krishnan et al., 2008; Konig et al., 2008;
Simonis et al., 2012; Uetz et al., 2006; Zhang et al., 2009; Zhou
et al., 2008) approaches.

Human protein—protein interaction (Hu-PPI) network is robust to
random attacks owing to its scale-free nature (Barabasi, 1999); how-
ever, the network breaks down due to targeted attacks (Albert et al.,
2000). Studies have shown that viral proteins interact with hubs,
bottlenecks and rich clubs in Hu-PPI network, and they also interact
with the human proteins involved in signalling, cell cycle regulation,
cell trafficking, transcription and translation (Calderwood et al., 2007;
de Chassey et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Navratil et al., 2011; Uetz
et al., 2006; Wuchty et al., 2010). The fact that viral proteins, although
very a few in number, target hubs, bottlenecks and rich clubs indicates
that viral subversion of human cellular processes is achieved by tar-
geted attacks (Meyniel-Schicklin et al., 2012). Our recent study has re-
vealed yet another interesting facet of viral proteins that some of them
act as articulation points in the human-viral-bridged PPI network by
bridging unconnected components of Hu-PPI network, thereby media-
ting certain novel interactions to tune host machinery for their propa-
gation (Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2014).

In literature, one can find studies reporting properties of host
proteins targeted by viral proteins. For example, it has been reported
that the human proteins targeted by viruses are associated with dia-
betes and auto immune diseases (Navratil et al., 2011). Viral im-
mune modulators have been shown to target proteins involved in
signalling pathways and cellular processes (Pichlmair et al., 2012). It
has been found that the targets of HIV-1 are highly conserved across
primates (Jager et al., 2012).

Structural interaction network studies comprising about 50
viral-Hu-PPIs (Franzosa and Xia, 2011) have revealed that the en-
dogenous interfaces (Hu-PPI) evolve at slower rates compared with
rest of the surface, whereas the exogenous interfaces (viral targets)
evolve at faster rates (Franzosa and Xia, 2011). Later studies based
on another dataset comprising 954 interactions reported results
(Franzosa et al., 2012) contradicted these results.

Among proteins, some are referred to as intrinsically disordered
proteins (IDPs) as these proteins are enriched with disordered re-
gions lacking stable three-dimensional structures. IDPs are known
to perform many biological functions such as signalling, regulatory
processes, DNA binding and transcription (Babu et al., 2011; Dyson
and Wright, 2005; Tompa, 2002, 2009; Uversky and Dunker,
2010). IDPs usually interact with large number of proteins and
hence occupy topologically important positions in protein—protein
interaction networks (Dosztanyi et al., 2006; Kim et al., 2008).
They are tightly regulated (Gsponer et al., 2008) in the cell and
found to harbour short linear motifs [SLiMs/eukaryotic linear motifs
(ELMs)] in their disordered regions that are recognized by modular
protein domains such as SH3, PDZ and SH2 (Diella et al., 2008;
Nguyen Ba et al., 2012).

Many genomes, from prokaryotes to eukaryotes, harbour several
genes that code for IDPs (Ward et al., 2004a) (about 2.0% in archaea,
4.2% in bacteria and 33.0% in eukaryotes). Viral genomes too code
for IDPs, and the proportion of amino acids in the disordered regions
of these genomes vary from 1% to 70% depending on their hosts or
genome types (Pushker et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012). Furthermore,
some of the viruses harbour sequences that mimic ELMs in the dis-
ordered regions (Davey et al., 2011; Diella et al., 2008).

Some of the IDPs are associated with certain human genetic dis-
orders, cancers, neurodegenerative and autoimmune diseases (Babu
et al., 2011; Midic et al., 2009; Uversky et al., 2008). However, role
of IDPs in infectious diseases, in particular those caused by viral in-
fections, has not been well studied.

In this study, we report a systematic analysis of characteristic
features of human proteins interacting with viral proteins (hVIPs) as
well as on general features of human-virus (Hu-Vir) PPI. We find

that significant number of hVIPs can be classified as IDPs.
Furthermore, hVIPs occupy central positions in PPI network; evolve
at relatively slower rates; involve in multiple pathways, harbour a
number of potential binding interfaces and linear motifs in their dis-
ordered regions. We also find that virus-Hu-PPIs are mediated by a
common set of domain—motif interactions (DMIs).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Interaction data

2.1.1 Hu-Vir PPI data

The dataset used in this study is same as the one used in our previous
study (Halehalli and Nagarajaram, 2014). For the sake of continu-
ity, we give some essential details of this dataset. The dataset com-
prises curated human and virus protein interaction data, which were
obtained from the publically available, literature-curated databases
VirusMINT (Chatr-aryamontri et al., 2009) and PIG (Driscoll et al.,
2009). In addition, interactions predicted from yeast two-hybrid
studies of human proteins with Vaccinia virus (Zhang et al., 2009),
Dengue virus (Khadka et al., 2011), HTLV-1 and HTLV-2 (Simonis
et al., 2012) were also added (further details are given in
Supplementary Material).

2.1.2 Hu-PPI data

Union of PPIs in HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009) and IntAct
(Aranda et al., 2010) was used as a representative dataset of binary
Hu-PPIs for studies reported here. The data consist of 49 772 inter-
actions involving 10 446 proteins. Of the proteins in this dataset,
8887 are not represented in the Hu-Vir protein—protein interaction
(Hu-Vir PPI) dataset and therefore, they are referred to as ‘non—
hVIPs’ for the purpose of comparative analysis with hVIPs.

2.2 Disorder and subcellular localization prediction

2.2.1 Prediction of intrinsic disorder in proteins

Structural disorder in human proteins was predicted using
DISOPRED2 (Ward et al., 2004b) with a false-positive rate of up to
2.0, and the protein sequences used for predictions correspond to
the reviewed canonical forms represented in UniProt/SwissProt
(version 116) (preiler et al., 2004). In literature, a protein is said
to be disordered depending on the length of disordered region
(Ward et al., 2004a) or percentage of disordered residues (Gsponer
et al., 2008) in that protein. In this study, a protein is considered as
disordered (IDP) if it has >30% of its residues in the predicted dis-
ordered regions; ordered protein (ODP) if it has 310% of its resi-
dues in disordered regions and moderately disordered protein
(MDP) if it has 10—30% of its residues in disordered regions. While
performing X2 tests, we have used the expected numbers of IDPs,
MDPs and ODPs calculated from their % in UniProt/SwissProt.

2.2.2 Subcellular localization of human proteins and localization
entropy

Subcellular localization was predicted using localization prediction
tool WOLF PSORT (Horton et al., 2007). Localization entropy (LE,
Snel et al., 2002) of a hVIP was calculated using the following
formula:

Tk Tk
LE = —Z T108 
Zk Tk Zia Tk
Where Tk is the number of times that the subcellular localization ‘k’
associated with all known human protein partners of a human

protein in Hu-PPI network and ‘n’ is the number of distinct subcellu-
lar localizations associated with all interacting human proteins.
Similarly, LE was calculated for all viral proteins based on subcellu-
lar localization of their human interacting partners in Hu-Vir PPI
network.

2.3 Pathway centrality, gene expression, protein
abundance, splice variants and evolutionary rate of
proteins

Kyoto Encyclopaedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa,
2000) pathway annotation data were used to find the pathways
involving hVIPs and other human proteins of interest. We defined the
total number of pathways a human protein is involved as its pathway
centrality. Gene expression data were downloaded from BioGPS (Wu
et al., 2009), and median of the expression values was used as the
cutoff for designating a gene as ‘expressed’ or ‘not expressed’ in a
given tissue. Protein abundance information was taken from PaxDb
(Wang et al., 2012). Splice variant/transcript count, dN and (LS values
for proteins were retrieved from BioMart (Kinsella et al., 2011)
(Ensemble). Overall evolutionary rate (dN/dS) was quantified for
hVIPs and ‘non-hVIPs’ of Hu-PPI network as the divergence of human
protein sequences from mouse orthologous protein sequences.

2.4 Putative binding interfaces and ELM motifs in
proteins

We used ANCHOR (Dosztanyi et al., 2009) to predict the putative
binding interfaces in the disordered regions of proteins. ANCHOR
also identifies known ELMs [which are listed in ELM database
(Dinkel et al., 2012)] present in a given protein. ELM enrichment P
values for hVIPs were calculated using Fisher test in R, and resultant
P values were adjusted using false discovery rate (FDR) correction
method in R.

2.5 Mapping DMIs and domain—domain interactions
Domains were identified in human protein and viral protein se-
quences using the domain search tool InterProScan (Quevillon et al.,
2005). ELMs in both human and viral proteins were identified using
ANCHOR. A domain interacting with an ELM is referred to as a
linear motif binding domain (LMBD). Known DMIs were taken
from ELM database (Dinkel et al., 2012) and iELM web server
(Weatheritt et al., 2012). ELM-LMBD pairs in ELM database
comprise 200 experimentally determined, literature-curated associ-
ations. iELM web server predicts ELM-LMBD associations in Hu-
PPI pairs and hence we predicted interactions for all Hu-PPIs in the
dataset using iELM and obtained 116 high confidence domain—
motif pairs. Union of aforementioned sources comprising 240
iELMs were searched in Hu-Vir PPI pairs. Domain—domain inter-
action (DDI) data were downloaded from inam (Finn et al., 2005),
which gives known DDIs from PDB structures and from DOMINE
(Yellaboina et al., 2011), which is a database of predicted DDIs.
Using these DDI data, Hu-Vir PPI pairs were screened for the pres-
ence of interacting domain pairs.

3 Results

Earlier studies had shown that viruses target central nodes in the
Hu-PPI network (Calderwood et al., 2007; de Chassey et al., 2008;
Dyer et al., 2008; Navratil et al., 2011; Uetz et al., 2006). We recon-
firmed these results by analyzing our dataset, which is much larger
and also non-redundant (Supplementary Materials and Methods)
when compared with the ones used in the earlier studies.

We calculated different centrality measures (Supplementary
Materials and Methods) such as degree, betweenness, transitivity/
clustering coefficient, closeness, PageRank, Eigen vector and hub
score for hVIPs in Hu-PPI network and compared them with non-
hVIPs. It was found that hVIPs are associated with higher centrality
measures (P<< 10‘”) when compared with non-hVIPs
(Supplementary Table 51), thereby reconfirming earlier observations
that viruses attack centrally important nodes in Hu-PPI network.
Attack on centrally important nodes is akin to targeted attacks and
such attacks are known to breakdown networks (Meyniel-Schicklin
et al., 2012). This reconfirms earlier findings (Calderwood et al.,
2007; de Chassey et al., 2008; Dyer et al., 2008; Navratil et al.,
2011; Uetz et al., 2006) that viruses target important proteins that
allow them to gain control over information ﬂow in Hu-PPI net-
work, which in turn help for their replication and reproduction.

3.1 Viruses target human proteins that are rich in
disordered regions

In our dataset, nearly 70% (1196 of 1735) of the hVIPs are either
IDPs or MDPs (Fig. 1a), and this corresponds to a significant enrich-
ment for disordered proteins in viral targets considering the distribu-
tion of IDPs and MDPs observed in all the known human proteins
in Uniprot/Swissprot (P<< 10‘16) (Fig.1a). Involvement of protein
disorder in Hu-Vir PPIs is also reflected in the number of interacting
pairs involving structurally disordered proteins. Of the 3389 pairs,
about 60% of them involve either disordered human or disordered
viral protein or both (Fig. 1b). Interacting pairs where both human
and viral proteins are ODPs constitute mere 12% of the pairs in our
dataset. Such interactions are mostly seen in extra cellular space, cell
membrane and cytoplasm. The fact that a majority of Hu-Vir PPIs is
mediated by protein disorder asserts one to think beyond the so
called ‘structural interaction networks (SINs)’ as proposed by
(Franzosa and Xia, 2011) for viral-Hu-PPIs.

We also found that the extent of disorder in hVIPs is negatively
correlated (r: —0.76, P: 0.005) to the extent of disorder in their
interacting viral proteins (Fig. 2a). This indicates that the hVIPs and
their viral interacting partners complement each other in their struc-
tural disorder/order. Further, we investigated structural disorder of
hVIPs and their viral proteins with respect to subcellular localization
of hVIPs (Fig. 2b). The structural disorder associated with hVIPs

cytoskeleton and endoplasmic reticulum are mostly ODPs, whereas
those found in cytoplasm, mitochondria, peroxisome and nucleus
are mostly IDPs (Supplementary Fig. Sla and b). On the other hand,
the viral proteins that interact with hVIPs found in extracellular
space, cell membrane and cytoskeleton are disordered, and they are
mostly ordered in nucleus mitochondria and peroxisome. hVIPs
localized to nucleus and cytoplasm constitute majority of Hu-Vir
PPIs (Supplementary Fig. 52). This suggests that intrinsic conform-
ational flexibility associated with protein structural disorder is one
of the key characteristic features of Hu-Vir PPIs.

3.2 Viruses target universally expressed and
functionally diverse proteins

To understand the spatial expression pattern of the hVIPs, we calcu-
lated their expression breadths (the number of tissues in which
hVIPs are expressed) and found that hVIPs are expressed in many
tissues (P < 10‘”) (Fig. 3a). We also found that hVIPs are enriched
with many splice variants (P< 10‘”) (Fig. 3b). Furthermore, we
counted the number of KEGG pathways involving each of the hVIPs
(referred to as Pathway Centrality) and found that hVIPs when com-
pared with non—hVIPs are associated with higher pathway central-
ities (P<< 10—16) (Fig. 3c).

To know whether the interacting partners of hVIPs and non-
hVIPs in Hu-PPI network and those of viral proteins in Hu-Vir PPI
network are localized to a few cellular locations or found in many
diverse localizations, we calculated their LE values. It was found
that hVIPs are associated with higher LEs than non-hVIPs
(P<< 10‘”) indicating that the human partners of the hVIPs are
located in diverse locations than the partners of non-hVIPs. Viral
proteins show smaller LE compared with hVIPs (P << 10‘“) indicat-
ing that the partners of viral proteins or VPs (i.e. hVIPs) are located
in fewer localizations which is similar to that of non-hVIPs (Fig. 3d).
However, it is interesting to note that few viral proteins such as
HIV-1 and HIV-2 nef (LE 2 0.73 each) and EBV BFLF2 (LE 2 0.70)
show very high LE. LE of hVIPs positively correlates with their de-
gree in Hu- PPI network (Spearman rank correlation, rho=0.66,
P < 10‘196), and LE of VPs strongly correlates with the number of
hVIPs they interact with (rho=0.80, P< 10—325). Viruses target
house-keeping proteins that are associated with high splice variation

Fig. 3. hVIPs are associated with functional diversity. (a) Expression breadths
of hVIPs and non-hVIPs. hVIPs are expressed in many tissues when com-
pared with non-hVIPs(P<<10_16). (b) Transcript abundance of hVIPs and non-
VIPs. hVIPs are associated with higher number of splice variants when com-
pared with non-hVIPs (P<10‘12). (c) Pathway centrality of hVIPs and non-
hVIPs. hVIPs are involved in higher number of pathways (KEGG) than non-
hVIPs (P<<10_16). (d) Distribution of LE values of hVIPs, non-hVIPs and viral
proteins (VPs); hVIPs show higher LE than non-hVIPs and viral proteins
(P<<10‘16)

and involved in regulation of multiple pathways and hence are able
to manipulate diverse cellular processes.

3.3 Viruses target abundantly expressed and slow
evolving proteins

We investigated hVIPs and non-hVIPs for protein abundance, pres-
ence of PEST motifs (sites for ubiquitination) and their overall evo-
lutionary rates. We found that hVIPs are abundantly expressed
when compared with non-hVIPs (P < 10‘”) (Fig. 4a). hVIPs do not
differ from non-hVIPs in the number of PEST motifs they harbour
(P = 0.06) (Supplementary Fig. S3), suggesting that both the groups
of proteins have similar propensities for their regulation.
hVIPs show smaller dN/dS ratios when compared with non-hVIPs
suggesting that they are evolving at much slower rates than non-
hVIPs (P 2 10‘”) (Fig. 4b). It has been shown that immune system
related proteins usually show higher dN/dS values (Fumagalli et al.,
2011; Nielsen et al., 2005 ). Our investigations too reveal that
immune-system-related proteins show distinctly higher evolutionary
rates when compared with other proteins among hVIPs (P < 10‘s)
and non-hVIPs (P < 10‘“). However, between the immune related
proteins of hVIPs and that of non-hVIPs, the former group shows
lower dN/dS values when compared with the latter group (P < 10‘3)
(Supplementary Fig. S4). These results collectively suggest that viral
targets are abundantly expressed and are relatively conserved when
compared with non-hVIPs.

3.4 Linear motifs enriched in hVIPs
We calculated dN/dS (divergence from orthologous mouse sequence)
values separately for disordered and ordered regions in hVIPs and

Fig. 4. hVIPs are abundantly expressed and slow evolving. (a) Averaged pro-
tein abundance of hVIPs and non-hVIPs in the human tissues; hVIPs are more
abundantly expressed than non-hVIPs (P<<10_16). (b) dN/dS (divergence

at slower rates than non-hVIPs(P<10_13)

non-hVIPs using the program PAML4.8 (Yang, 2007). As reported
in the literature (Brown et al., 2002, 2010), disordered residues have
higher dN/dS values when compared with the dN/dS values of
ordered regions in hVIPs and non-hVIPs (P < 1048). When we com-
pared dN/dS values of disordered regions in hV IPs with those in
non-hVIPs, we found that the disordered regions in hVIPs have
slightly lower dN/dS values (P < 10‘3) (Supplementary Fig. S5).

Disorder in proteins can be classified into three types: (i) con-
strained disorder (highly conserved), (ii) ﬂexible disorder and (iii)
non-conserved disorder (Bellay et al., 2011). Constrained disordered
regions usually harbour motifs referred to as SLiMs/ELMs (Brown
et al., 2010; Diella et al., 2008; Nguyen Ba et al., 2012), which con-
fer them differential regulation and varied functions (Babu et al.,
2011; Diella et al., 2008; Dinkel et al., 2012). With the help of
ANCHOR (Dosztanyi et al., 2009), we predicted binding interfaces
and ELMs in proteins. We found that hVIPs harbour higher number
of binding interfaces and ELMs when compared with non-hVIPs
(P << 10‘“) (Fig. 5). These binding surfaces and ELMs enable viral
proteins to interact with many partners. This explains why hVIPs
show higher centrality values in the interaction network when com-
pared with non-hVIPs.

Further we calculated enrichment score for ELMs in hVIPs. Of the
118 ELMs found in 1735 hVIPs, 62 were enriched in hVIPs
(P < 0.05; Fisher test FDR corrected) (Supplementary Table S2). The
enriched motifs are involved in regulation of various signalling path-
ways through kinase actions (such as GSK3_1, CK1, MAPK and
LIG_PDZ/SH3/SH2) and those corresponding to post-translational
modification sites [the motifs GlcNHglycan, N_GLC_1 and SUMO
(Small ubiquitin like molecule)]. It is to be noted that ELMs act as mo-
lecular switches (Van Roey et al., 2012) in regulation of many proc-
esses and used for transient binding with variety of proteins.

3.5 DMIs and DDIs involved in Hu-Vir PPls

ELMs interact with their LMBDs leading to distinct ELM-LMDB
pairs. We prepared a list of potential ELM-LMDB pairs as a union
set of (i) 116 high confidence ELM-LMBD pairs predicted from
human protein interaction pairs using iELM webserver (Weatheritt
et al., 2012) and (ii) the 200 curated ELM-LMBD pairs present in
ELM database (Dinkel et al., 2012). Union set ELM-LMBD pairs or
DMIs consists of 240 non-redundant pairs. The Hu-Vir interacting
proteins were scanned for the presence of ELM-LMBD pairs, which
resulted in 985 LMBDs (hVIPs) and ELMs (VPs) interactions in 295
Hu-Vir pairs (Table 1) between 54 unique DMIs are found. Of the
54 unique pairs of DMIs, 20 are experimentally known (Davey

et al., 2011) (Supplementary Table S3). We also found 47 ELM
(hVIP)-LMBD (VPs) interactions in 12 Hu-Vir PPIs (Table 1 and
Supplementary Table S4) between 11 unique pairs of motif—domain
interactions (MDIs). MDIs are mostly formed between SH2 and
SH3 domains in Sarcoma viral proteins or Cyclin_1 in Herpes viral
proteins and corresponding interacting motifs in human proteins.

In addition to the DMIs, DDIs can also mediate viral Hu-PPIs.
We, therefore, identified interacting domain pairs (or DDIs) in the
interacting human and viral proteins. The interacting domain pairs
were taken from inam (Finn et al., 2005) and DOMINE
(Yellaboina et al., 201 1) as described in Section 2. We could identify
225 DDI interactions in 172 unique Hu-Vir PPIs between 90 pairs
of DDIs (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S5). These DDIs are
formed between 51 unique Pfam domains in 126 unique human pro-
teins and 49 unique Pfam domains in 53 unique viral proteins.
About 70% of the DDIs (156 of 225) resolved in our study are from
ordered viral proteins interacting with both ordered and disordered
human proteins. As can be seen, viral Hu-PPIs are predominantly
mediated by DMIs than DDIs, and this result is consistent with the
recently published work (Garamszegi et al., 2013). Our investiga-
tions also revealed subcellular localization-specific utilization of
DDIs and DMIs. hVIPs that utilize DDIs for viral interactions are
mostly found in extracellular space, plasma membrane, cytoskeleton
and peroxisome, whereas those utilizing DMIs are found in cyto-
plasmic, mitochondrial and nuclear localizations (Supplementary
Fig. S6a—h).

A bipartite network (Fig. 6) of DDIs and DMIs in Hu-Vir PPI
revealed that ELMs interact with their unique domain counterparts,
whereas domains interact with multiple ELMs and domains
(P=0.01) (Fig. 7a). There are more DMIs per Hu-Vir PPI than
DDIs (P < 10‘”) (Fig. 7b), and multiple DMIs are used by individ-
ual Hu-Vir PPIs when compared with DDIs between protein pairs
(P 2 10‘”) (Fig. 7c). It is interesting to note that some of the linear
motifs often used by viruses to interact with host proteins are uti-
lized in signalling pathways, which include kinase functions
(Pkinase, SH2, SH3_1 domains), cell cycle regulation (TRAF6,
TRAF2, APPCC_Dbox1, WW domains) or protein degradation
(MATH domain) or cleavage (Peptidase_58) pathways (Diella et al.,
2008). Viruses, therefore, by mimicking human motifs interfere in
the regulation of the concerned pathways. A DMI, when compared
with DDI, is utilized by multiple viruses (P: 10*”) (Fig. 7d)
suggesting that such DMIs form common mode of molecular inter-
actions by multiple viruses, whereas DDIs are virus specific. Further

Fig. 6. Domain and motif utilization in Hu-Vi PPls represented by means of human—virus domain—motif and domain—domain bipartite interaction network.
Domains corresponding to human protein are represented by blue circles and motifs by blue vee. Domains corresponding to viral proteins are represented by
coral octagon and motifs by coral triangles. Edge thickness corresponds to number of Hu-Vir PPI using particular DMI or DDI and node size corresponds to degree
in the current network. Network comprises 54 domain (in hVIP)—motif (in VP) associations from 302 Hu-Vir PPI, 11 motif (hVIP)—domain (VP) associations from 47

Hu-Vir PPI and 90 DDI from 172 Hu-Vir PPls. Network was visualized using Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003)

we calculated KEGG pathway enrichment of human proteins
involved in DDIs and DMIs among different families of viruses, and
comparison of the enriched pathways (P < 0.05) reveals that com-
mon set of pathways are targeted via DMIs by different families of
viruses (Supplementary Fig. 58a and b). Pathways uniquely enriched
in hVIPs that utilize DDIs are related to immune recognition such as
antigen processing, IgA production, NOD-like receptor signalling
and mRNA surveillance (e.g. Fig. 6 for MHC I, MHC II and Ig do-
mains utilizing DDI). In the hVIPs that utilize DDI and DMI with
their viral partners many immune signalling pathways and cell cycle
regulation pathways are enriched. It is interesting to note that few
signalling pathways (mTOR, insulin, adipocytokine signalling path-
ways) related to regulation of metabolism are also enriched in hVIPs
utilizing DMI with viral proteins (Supplementary Fig. 58a and b). In
our previous work, we have shown certain viral proteins acting as

articulation points that bridge human proteins in metabolic path-
ways to the giant component in Hu-PPI network (Halehalli and
Nagarajaram, 2014).

4 Discussion

Viral replication inside host is marked by various stages of life cycle.
During various stages of viral life cycle, viral proteins interact with
human proteins localized to distinct cellular locations and distinct
functions: extra cellular space or plasma membrane for virus entry
and egress, cytoplasm during unpackaging or virion assembly, endo-
plasmic reticulum for protein synthesis and nucleus for viral tran-
scription/replication/mRNA processing. Our study has revealed that
Hu-Vir interactions mainly involve disordered proteins (60% Hu-

Vir PPI) (Fig. 1a and b), which provide inherent conformational
ﬂexibility to interacting partners perhaps as a means to compensate
structural variations caused by mutations that frequently happen in
viral proteins. Protein structural disorder in hVIPs and viral proteins
shows subcellular location-specific variation (Fig. 2a—h and supple-
mentary fig. 51a and b). In most of the Hu-Vir PPIs, human and
viral proteins complement each other in terms of their structural dis-
order—when one is disordered, the other is usually ordered.
Disorder-associated conformational flexibility thus seems to be the
common feature of Hu-Vi PPIs.

Viruses target human proteins that occupy central positions and
hence make targeted attacks on Hu-PPI by which they gain control
over information ﬂow in Hu-PPI network. hVIPs are expressed across
multiple tissues suggesting that they are housekeeping genes which are
required for cellular processes. hVIPs are associated with splice vari-
ation, involved in multiple pathways and localized to multiple subcellu-
lar locations thus presenting diversity and variation to interacting viral
proteins. Viruses are known to jump across species to cause diseases
(Morens et al., 2004; Woolhouse et al., 2005) as a consequence of their
co-evolution with host proteins. Immune system proteins evolve at
higher rates when compared with non-immune proteins (Fumagalli
et al., 2011; Nielsen et al., 2005 ). Our study also has revealed that im-
mune hVIPs evolve at faster rate, whereas non-immune hVIPs show
slowest evolutionary rate. These observations suggest two facets of
viral infections: (i) evolutionary arms race between viral and antiviral
proteins consistent with (Daugherty and Malik, 2012) and (ii) viruses’
capability to infect different hosts (Sawyer and Elde, 2012). Viral
pathogen of one host species cause a severe pathological symptoms in
an another closely related host species. For example, HIV-1 (Huet
et al., 1990) and HIV-2 (Hirsch et al., 1989) are thought to have
jumped from Chimpanzee and Sooty mangabey, respectively. Inﬂuenza

H1N1 causative of swine ﬂu has jumped from pigs to humans and
KFDV (Kyasanoor forest disease virus) that causes the disease in
human has jumped from monkey.

hVIPs show higher number of interfaces in disordered regions
compared with non-hVIPs, and they can form multi-interface hubs
(Kim et al., 2008). Large number of interfaces in a protein enables it
to interact with multiple proteins. hVIPs are also enriched with
ELMs, which function in regulation of activities of proteins in cellu-
lar processes such as endocytosis, signalling, transcription, cell cycle
regulation and protein degradation pathways.

When we resolved Hu-Vir PPI using known DMI and DDI infor-
mation, we found that viruses mainly utilize ELMs with hVIPs. In a
recent study, Garamszegi et al. (2013) reported that interspecies
PPIs between human and viral proteins are mostly characterized by
DMIs compared with intraspecies interactions They also reported
that 30% Hu-Vir PPIs can be resolved using DDI and DMIs. In our
study, with high coverage of almost all known Hu-Vir PPIs and
higher number of DDIs and DMIs than previously reported in litera-
ture (Garamszegi et al., 2013), we found only 11.6% of the inter-
actions utilize either DDI or DMI.

ELMs in viral proteins mimic host motifs. Mimicking SLiMs is
evolutionarily favourable for viruses as they undergo mutations rap-
idly driving convergent evolution (Davey et al., 2011). Mimicked
ELMs in viral proteins mostly target kinase functions, cell cycle
regulation, protein degradation and cleavage pathways. In bipartite
DDI and DMI network, we found that DDIs are widespread, and
viral domains are involved in multiple interactions with different do-
mains, whereas motifs are involved in single interaction with corres-
ponding LMBD and are utilized by multiple Hu-Vir PPIs. It was also
found that DDIs are mostly virus specific, whereas DMIs are used
by multiple viruses.

KEGG pathways enriched in hVIPs involved in DMI with viral pro-
teins of different viral families indicate that they are common among
families and those of DDIs are more specific to families of viruses. This
further confirms convergent evolution of linear motifs in viruses be-
longing to different families as a strategy to target common pathways.
KEGG pathways uniquely enriched in DDI and DMI are distinct. In
DDI, they are related to immune recognition of viruses, whereas in
DMI, they are related to metabolism, cell cycle regulation and immune
signalling. It is well established that certain viral proteins modulate pat-
tern recognition receptor (PRR) signalling pathways (Bowie and
Unterholzner, 2008), and our results show downstream signalling pro-
teins of PRR pathways form DMI with viral proteins indicating viruses
use linear motifs for manipulating these pathways. Proteins containing
WW domain, which have role in cell cycle regulation (Salah and
Aqeilan, 2011), are targeted by viruses by mimicking WW domain
binding motifs consistent with previous studies (Freed, 2002; Winberg
et al., 2000). Non-homologous end joining pathway is enriched in
hVIPs involved in DMIs of Retroviridae and Herpesviridae whose acti-
vation is required for retroviruses (Li et al., 2001) and inhibition during
lytic cycle of herpes viruses (Rennekamp and Lieberman, 2010).
Interestingly, we found a few pathways involved in regulation of me-
tabolism such as carbohydrate absorption, insulin signalling, adipocy-
tokine signalling, mTOR signalling and inositol phosphate
metabolism, which are also enriched in hVIPs targeted via ELMs in
viral proteins. Viral modulation of metabolic pathways (Birch et al.,
2012; Heaton and Randall, 2011) is being studied in recent years.
mTOR signalling pathway is known to be manipulated by pathogens
(Martin et al., 2012), our study revealed that AKT, GSK and PIK3K
are targeted by many viruses by mimicking pkinase domain binding
motifs (Fig. 6 and Supplementary Table 3). HCV has been shown to
stimulate phosphoinositol 4 phosphate production via activation of

PI4K3 kinase activation (Berger et al., 2011) consistent with our find-
ing inositol phosphate metabolism being targeted by means of DMIs.
Our previous study on Hu-Vir-bridged networks has revealed certain
viral proteins acting as articulation points and as a consequence bridge
metabolic pathways to the signalling pathways. Aforementioned obser-
vations and examples in a nutshell support that host-like linear motifs
in viral protein sequences are used for modulation of host functions by
viruses.

Although the known protein disorder in the viral genomes vary
broadly in the range from 1 to 70%, majority of them are in the
range of 10—30% (Pushker et al., 2013; Xue et al., 2012). Our study
has also shown that majority of viral proteins are ODPs and MDPs
structured (% of disordered residues <30%). Disordered viral pro-
teins (Meyniel-Schicklin et al., 2012) show high-degree centrality.
Though viral disordered proteins are less in number, we see that
they interact with higher number of hVIPs owing to their disorder
and higher number of ELMs. Some viral proteins have shown to
contain higher density of ELMs (Garamszegi et al., 2013). Few stud-
ies focusing presence of ELMs in disordered proteins of HCV (Fan
et al., 2014) and across viral genomes (Hagai et al., 2014) have been
reported. There are large numbers of uncharacterized ELMs in dis-
ordered regions of viral proteins, which may have functional impli-
cations (Hagai et al., 2014; Tompa et al., 2014). In our study, we
see viruses utilizing ELMs as a common strategy to manipulate cer-
tain pathways. Presence of large numbers of putative ELMs indicate
that viruses may use molecular mimicry of ELMs as a strategy to re-
wire host’s regulatory and signalling pathways. Current approaches
based on limited structural data are inadequate to uncover all the
ELMs involved in Hu-Vir PPIs.

5 Conclusion

Our study has shed light on general molecular characteristics of tar-
geted viral attack on host cells. Viruses have evolved in such a way
that they employ targeted attack strategy by interacting with import-
ant proteins of Hu-PPI network, which are mostly IDPs. In most of
the cases, Hu-Vir PPIs commonly involve at least one IDP providing
conformational flexibility to the protein interaction. Viruses were
found to utilize intrinsic disorder in human proteins and of viral pro-
teins differentially in different subcellular locations. Interactions
with central proteins enable viruses to take control of host network
and redirect it towards synthesis of viral genome and proteins.
hVIPs were found to be enriched with binding interfaces in dis-
ordered region and SLiMs/ELMs in them. Viruses mimic host motifs
and utilize them for targeted attack on certain host cellular path-
ways. Presence of motifs which act as molecular switches in regula-
tion of multiple pathways, high connectivity and global expression,
involvement in multiple pathways, slow evolutionary rate, protein
abundance and high LE in human proteins makes them Achilles’
heel for targeted attack by viral proteins. Viruses irrespective of their
families mimic linear motifs in their protein sequences as a common
strategy to subvert specified functions undergoing convergent evolu-
tion. Information control, functional diversity, protein abundance,
evolutionary plasticity of viruses to mimic host ELMs and conform-
ational flexibility are the governing principles of Hu-Vir PPIs. This
knowledge can be further exploited for screening and developing
broad spectrum of antiviral therapies.

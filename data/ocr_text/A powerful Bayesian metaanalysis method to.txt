ABSTRACT

Motivation: Much research effort has been devoted to the identifi-
cation of enriched gene sets for microarray experiments. However,
identified gene sets are often found to be inconsistent among
independent studies. This is probably owing to the noisy data of
microarray experiments coupled with small sample sizes of individual
studies. Therefore, combining information from multiple studies is
likely to improve the detection of truly enriched gene classes.
As more and more data become available, it calls for statistical
methods to integrate information from multiple studies, also known
as meta-analysis, to improve the power of identifying enriched gene
sets.

Results: We propose a Bayesian model that provides a coherent
framework for joint modeling of both gene set information and gene
expression data from multiple studies, to improve the detection of
enriched gene sets by leveraging information from different sources
available. One distinct feature of our method is that it directly models
the gene expression data, instead of using summary statistics, when
synthesizing studies. Besides, the proposed model is flexible and
offers an appropriate treatment of between-study heterogeneities
that frequently arise in the meta-analysis of microarray experiments.
We show that under our Bayesian model, the full posterior conditionals
all have known distributions, which greatly facilitates the MCMC com-
putation. Simulation results show that the proposed method can im-
prove the power of gene set enrichment meta-analysis, as opposed to
existing methods developed by Shen and Tseng (2010, Bioinformatics,
26, 1316—1323), and it is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations
from the distributional assumption for gene expression data. We
illustrate the proposed method through an application of combining
eight lung cancer datasets for gene set enrichment analysis, which
demonstrates the usefulness of the method.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although microarray analysis initially focused on identifying dif-
ferentially expressed (DE) genes, increased attention has been
paid to pathway or gene set analysis, which aims to detect altered
biological pathways or other pre—deﬁned gene classes rather than
individual genes (e.g. Barry et al., 2008; Efron and Tibshirani,
2007; Hosack et al., 2003; Kim and Volsky, 2005; Subramaniana
et al., 2005; Tian et al., 2005). Gene sets are usually deﬁned based
on gene functions, ontology information, chromosomal proxim-
ity or known regulatory relationships. Gene sets that are altered
in responding to changes in phenotypes or treatments may pro-
vide important insights into molecular functions and gene regu-
latory relationships underlying biological processes. Also, it has
been reported that gene set analysis tends to yield more repro-
ducible and interpretable results than single gene analysis
(Manoli et al., 2006; Subramaniana et al., 2005).

A major type of the gene set analysis is to determine whether a
pre—deﬁned category of genes is enriched (i.e. over-represented)
by DE genes, often referred to as gene set (or pathway) enrich-
ment analysis. A gene set is claimed to be enriched if it contains
more DE genes than would be expected by chance. Many meth-
ods have been developed in gene set enrichment analysis for a
single genomic study. For recent reviews, see Ackermann and
Strimmer (2009), Hung et al. (2012) and the references therein.

Although plenty of gene expression data are publicly available
now, it is challenging to integrate information of gene set enrich-
ment analysis from multiple genomic studies targeting the same
biological problem. Often sample sizes of individual studies are
not large and microarray data are noisy, making estimation and
inference highly variable. This often leads to inconsistent conclu-
sions across studies. Integrative analysis of independent studies
may facilitate information sharing and improve the power of
detecting truly enriched gene classes, as well as increase reprodu-
cibility and interpretability. However, direct combination of mul-
tiple microarray datasets such as stacking them into one is
extremely difﬁcult owing to the incompatibility of data generated
from various microarray platforms and different versions within
the same platform (Mah et al., 2004). Therefore, meta-analysis, a
systematic statistical synthesis of data from multiple studies, has
been widely used to aggregate evidence from related studies
(Manoli et al., 2006). Most meta-analyses currently target
gene-level analysis with the exception of Shen and Tseng
(2010) who, for the ﬁrst time, systematically developed and eval-
uated meta-analysis for pathway enrichment analysis in

Bayesian meta-analysis of gene set enrichment studies

 

microarray studies (Tseng et al., 2012). They proposed three
methods, namely, meta-analysis for pathway enrichment at
gene level (MAPE_G), meta-analysis for pathway enrichment
at pathway level (MAPE_P) and meta-analysis for pathway en-
richment integrated (MAPE_I), all based on the popular method
GSEA (Subramanian et al., 2005) for enrichment analysis. All
these methods consist of two key stages. The ﬁrst is to conduct
differential expression analysis to obtain gene-level statistics for
each individual study. The second stage is to conduct pathway
enrichment analysis and meta-analysis in either order, where the
order distinguishes MAPE_G from MAPE_P: MAPE_G ﬁrst
conducts meta-analysis to combine the gene-level results over
all the studies, and then conduct pathway enrichment analysis
just once using the combined gene-level statistics; by contrast,
MAPE_P conducts pathway enrichment analysis for each indi-
vidual study and then combines the gene-set level results to get
the overall gene-set statistics for a ﬁnal conclusion. The third
method MAPE_I further combines the end results from
MAPE_G and MAPE_P for potential improvement in perform-
ance. See the top two panels of Figure l for the MAPE diagrams.
Undoubtedly, by formalizing these simple and natural ideas,
Shen and Tseng (2010) made an initial but important attempt
in meta-analysis of gene set enrichment. However, such sequen-
tial approaches in analysis might cause information loss by just
focusing on summary results from the previous steps without
using all the expression data available. Further, when there
exist various sources of heterogeneities among different datasets,

GE stands for gene expression; DE stands for differential expression and
GSEA stands for Gene Set Enrichment Analysis (Subramaniana et al.,
2005). Note that MAPEs are all based on GSEA for enrichment analysis

these methods may lack power in detection without explicitly
modeling the phenomena.

When data from component studies are available, using all
data in a fully integrated model-based framework is in general
more efﬁcient than a sequential approach using summary statis-
tics only. Speciﬁcally, the model should be able to account for
between-study heterogeneities that are widely present in micro-
array data. Heterogeneities include, among others, varying
experiment designs that lead to non-uniform inclusion of
genes, unequal sample sizes and data qualities. Moreover, the
gene expression measures in component studies may have differ-
ent means and variances depending on platforms and pre-pro-
cessing procedures. In this article, we propose a ﬂexible Bayesian
model that can offer an appropriate treatment of these problems
when aggregating multiple studies to identify enriched gene sets.
Our Bayesian method provides a natural way for data synthesis
by incorporating model and parameter uncertainties involved in
all studies. More importantly, it furnishes an integrated Bayesian
framework for jointly modeling gene expression data from mul-
tiple studies and gene set information. This will allow researchers
to conduct differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment
analysis and meta-analysis simultaneously, all based on objective
Bayesian posterior inference, which may yield more reliable sci-
entiﬁc ﬁndings than the existing sequential approaches. See
Figure l for comparison with the MAPE methods.

2 MODEL
Suppose there are K independent studies considered in a
meta-analysis and Ik samples in study k, where k = l, .... ..K.

Let J be the total number of distinct genes in the genome of
interest that appear in at least one of the K studies. Let ij be
an indicator variable for gene j being included in study k. Here,
different studies are allowed to have different genes from the
same genome, which offers great ﬂexibility in the inclusion of
potential studies for meta-analysis. Further, we assume that a
gene can have different expression intensity measures but share
the same DE/EE status in all constituent studies. In other words,
a DE (EE) gene will always be differentially (equally) expressed
in all the studies but the measurements of its expression can have
different magnitudes across studies, which, again, permits more
studies to be considered in the analysis.

Given ij = 1, let YUk be the expression intensity (after
pre-processing procedures and possibly some transformation)
for gene j in sample 1' of study k, where
i=1, ...,Ik,j=l, ...,Jandkzl, ...,K.Abinaryphenotype
label X,k is given to sample 1' of study k: Xik = 0 represents a
control sample, and X ,7, = 1 represents a case sample in study k.
The mean expression intensity of a gene is assumed to be the
same for all samples of each phenotype in a study, but in differ-
ent studies the mean intensity can be different for the given gene.
A common variance 0,3 of measurement errors is assumed for all
genes in study k. When the sample sizes are small or the
signal-to-noise ratios are low in one or more studies, as is typical
in many meta-analyses, this assumption would allow for infor-
mation pooling across genes under a hierarchical Bayes setup,
which is useful in stabilizing variance estimation. However, in
other situations, the common variance assumption might be

restrictive, and relaxing ois to gene-speciﬁc ofks can be done
(see discussion in Section 6). The model is speciﬁed as follows:

YijkIij = 1,0970 [BjkaXikaO—ji N N(Oljk + ,Bijikﬂjg), (1)

where orjk is the baseline expression level of gene j in study k (i.e.
the mean intensity for the control samples), and 5,7, is the change
in expression intensity between the different phenotypes. Let
11,- E (njo, nj+, nj_) be a status indicator vector for gene j: if gene j
is down-regulated (DR)/up-regulated (UR)/equally expressed
(EE), then 11,- =(0,0,1)/(0,1,0)/(1,0,0). Because the expression
change ,Bjk depends on gene j’s status, we assume that ,Bjk follow
a normal mixture distribution with three modes, namely 0, bk+
and bk_, which correspond to EE, UR and DR genes, respectively:
,Bjklnjd = 1 ~ N(bkd, rid), where d e {0, —l— , —}, bko E 0 and
bk_ <0 <bk+. Further, we assume that the baseline ajk follow a
normal distribution with study-speciﬁc mean and variance,
namely 097, ~ N(ak, 17,3). The indicator vector (njo, nj+, nj_) is
assumed to follow a multinomial distribution with the parameter
vector 6: (njo, nj+,nj_)|6 ~ Multin0m[l, (60, 6+, 6_)], where
6 = (60, 6+, 6_) can be interpreted as the probability of EE, UR
and DR genes in the overall gene list.

To account for uncertainties in the parameters introduced by
the model and to avoid subjective inference, we specify
non-informative priors on 6, bk+, bk_ and ak:
6 ~ Dirichlet(1, 1, 1), bk+ ~ Um'f(0, D), bk_ ~ Um'f(—D, 0),
ak ~ Um'f(—L, L), where D is chosen to be the maximum abso-
lute value of changes in gene expression between different pheno-
types in all K studies, and L is set to the maximum absolute value
of gene expression with phenotype 0 in all K studies. Further, all
variance components are given the Inverse-Gamma (w, v) prior.
Here, w and v are small numbers (e.g. w = v = 0.01) so that the
prior density reﬂects vague prior knowledge on those variance
parameters.

Now we proceed to model the gene set information. We
denote the class of all pre-deﬁned gene sets considered in the
meta-analysis by Z, and let G be the total number of gene sets.
We represent Z by a G X J matrix in which all elements are
binary variables. Let Zgj = 1, if gene j is in set g and Zgj = 0
otherwise. Because we do not require 28:1 Zgj = l for each gene
j, overlapping genes are allowed among different gene sets. Let
di = Pr(Zgj = llnjd = 1) be the conditional probability that a
gene is in set g given that the gene status is d, where
d e {0, + , —}. Then, for each set g and each gene j, the binary
variable Zgj can be modeled by a Bernoulli distribution condi-
tional on the status of gene j: Zgjlnjd = 1 ~ Bernoulli (di), where
d e {0, + , —}. Here (njo, nj+, nj_) is the key vector that connects
the gene sets with the expression data. If egg 2 g+ 2 6g_ for set
g, then Zgj is independent of 11,-; that is, whether any gene belongs
to set g does not depend on whether the gene is EE/UR/DR.
Further, if ago 2 6g+ 2 6g_ holds for all the gene sets, then the
gene expression data Y (the collection of all Yy-ks) become inde-
pendent of the gene set data Z. However, in many practical
situations, genes within certain pre-deﬁned gene sets (e.g. func-
tional groups, biological pathways) are likely to be co-expressed,
which leads to positive correlation in their expression levels (Pan,
2006; Wei and Pan, 2008; Wang et al., 2012). These genes, if DE,
tend to be altered in the same direction. Thus, 9,0 = g+ = 6 _
may not hold for some of the G gene sets so that Y and Z are

linked together because both are conditional on n (the collection
of all 7118). As will be shown later, through such a simple condi-
tional probability setup, our model leads to an efﬁcient Markov
chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm and our proposed
method compares favorably with competing methods.

Next, we assign Beta priors to dis for d e {0, —l—,—} and
g = l, ..., G: diygBetapflng, 6:,(J— ng)], where mg is the
number of genes in the gene set g, and 6:, represents the true
proportion of genes with status d in the overall gene list.
Although the values of 63s are unknown, they can be roughly
estimated from expression data using some existing method or
speciﬁed directly using relevant biological knowledge, or they
can be simply set to (l / 3, l / 3, l / 3) to reﬂect the non-informative
prior belief. From the beta prior, we see that the prior mean of
di is set to be ng/J, the proportion of genes in set g among the
total gene list. That means the mean probability for a gene falling
into set g is proportional to the size of the gene set ng and does
not depend on the gene status. In this sense, the prior is sort of
‘non—informative’. The prior variance of di is
(mg/J)(1—ng/J)/(6:,J). Thus, the larger 6:, is (i.e. more genes
with status d), the smaller the prior variance is. In practice, it
is often believed that only a few genes are truly ‘interesting’, and
most genes are EE. This prior speciﬁcation would allow that ago
for EE genes is more concentrated around the prior mean ng/J
for set g, while 6g+ and 6g_ for DE genes have large prior
variability around the mean. This seems to be reasonable.

3 POSTERIOR COMPUTATION AND BAYESIAN
INFERENCE

Details about Bayesian computation, including the full probabil-
ity model and full posterior conditionals, can be found in the
Supplementary Material. Although not all the parameters are
directly related to the detection of enriched gene sets, we need
to use MCMC to draw random samples from the joint posterior
distribution. Then statistical inference can be made by margin-
alizing over the posterior samples. One advantage of the pro-
posed model is that the posterior conditionals for all the
parameters involved, as listed above, are known distributions,
from each of which direct sampling can be done. This property
allows us to adopt an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler, in which all the
parameters are drawn sequentially and generated readily from
the above conditional distributions without using any built-in
sampling algorithm (such as Metropolis—Hastings and
Acceptance/Rejection algorithms).

Here, our Bayesian inference is primarily focused on the gene
set enrichment analysis. As mentioned in the introduction, an
enriched gene set is deﬁned as a set that has signiﬁcantly
higher percentage of DE genes than would be expected by
chance. Or more formally, let wgd be the conditional probability
that a gene has status d given that it is in set g. Then, a gene set g
is claimed to be enriched if wgar + 1p? >61r + 6_.

Let qbg E Pr(1pg+ —l— wg_ >61r + 6_ ID) be the posterior
probability that set g is enriched, where D represents all observed
data. Let 6S) and 6:2, denote the posterior draws of the
parameters 6,; and di in the tth iteration of MCMC, for
g :1, ...,G and d6 {0, +,—}. Then we can estimate qbg by
a, = 2111(1ng + 1001>5E9 + 6(1))/T, where T is the

Bayesian meta-analysis of gene set enrichment studies

 

total number of iterations after the burn-in period; 1png and $ng

are calculated using the following relationship based on the
Bayes rule: 1kg; 2 6:26:10 /(Zde{05 +,_} 62,62?) To identify
enriched gene sets, we can rank all the gene sets based on qbg
and select the sets on the top of the ranked list. The choice of a
signiﬁcance cutoff can be determined by controlling the Bayesian
false discovery rate (FDR) (Newton et al., 2004). For a given
cutoff c, the FDR can be estimated by

FDR(c) = {2:1 (1 — eg)1(¢g 3 c)}/{Zg:11(¢g 3 0)}, where
I(-) is the indicator function. We can choose c so that
FD7{+(C) f K, where K can be pre-speciﬁed (e.g. l, 5, 10%).

Unlike the existing MAPE methods that are purely
algorithm-based, our Bayesian model integrates all the informa-
tion from different sources coherently, which enables us to con-
duct differential expression analysis, gene set enrichment analysis
and meta-analysis in parallel rather than in a sequential manner.
Further, it allows the use of objective decision rules based on
posterior probabilities to detect enriched gene sets. The simple
classiﬁcation scheme makes the results from our Bayesian
inference easy to interpret.

4 SIMULATION

We design three simulation studies to examine the performance
of the proposed method in gene set enrichment meta-analysis,
and compare it with the three existing methods, MAPE_G,
MAPE_P and MAPE_I, developed by Shen and Tseng (2010).
In the ﬁrst study, we mainly follow the setup in Section 3.1 of
Shen and Tseng (2010) that uses a single gene-set simulation
model, and compare the power of the four methods in identifying
the enriched gene set under different scenarios. In the second
study, we extend the single gene-set model and consider multiple
gene sets: some sets are enriched by UR genes and so are referred
to as UR gene sets, some others are enriched by DR genes and so
are referred to as DR gene sets, and all the remaining ones are
non-enriched. This would allow us to compare the sensitivity and
speciﬁcity of the four methods using receiver operating charac-
teristic (ROC) curves. In the past study, we generate expression
data from non-normal distributions to examine whether there is
still an advantage of using the proposed method, as opposed to
the three existing methods, when the normality assumption for
gene expression intensities is violated.

In all our simulation, we follow Shen and Tseng (2010) and
run MAPEs at their default setting. Also, when specifying the
beta priors for the proposed method, we estimate 63s from data
using an overly simplistic approach so that the estimates are far
from the true values sometimes. In fact, our experience from
previous numerical studies suggests that the performance of
our method is robust to the choice of 63s. Thus, in practice, we
suggest the non-informative setup 6* E 1 / 3 for simplicity.

4.1 Simulation I

To compare the power in gene set enrichment analysis using
multiple studies, we apply the similar simulation settings as
described in Shen and Tseng (2010). Suppose there are 500
genes in the genome and the ﬁrst 100 genes are included in a
gene set, which is the only one considered in this simulation.

Shen and Tseng (2010) assumed that all DE genes involved are
UR genes. To simulate more realistic situations, we assume there
are (or — 5%) UR genes and 5% DR genes in the gene set. In the
remaining 400 genes, there are 5% UR genes and 5% DR genes.
Therefore, if or> 10%, this gene set is enriched. Note that in
Simulation I, we always include the case of or = 10%, where
the gene set is not enriched (i.e. the null case), to establish refer-
ence distributions of the statistics for the purpose of controlling
the type I error. In each study there are 40 samples where the ﬁrst
20 are control samples and the last 20 are case samples. Recall
that we use a binary variable ij to indicate whether gene j is
included in study k. Here, we assume a universal sampling rate A
for different studies, where )t E Pr( W, = 1), and we use
Bernoulli()t) to generate ijs so that the number of genes in
study k is random. All EE gene expression intensities are
assumed to follow N(0,1), and we set orjk E 0 for all k and j.
The UR genes in study k have expression intensities from
N(,ukj, 1) and DR genes are from N(I}kj,1), where jug->0 and
tag-<0. We set or e {0.10,0.15,0.25} and )t e {0.4,0.6,0.8, 1.0}.

As in Shen and Tseng (2010), ﬁve scenarios are considered in
Simulation I. In the ﬁrst three scenarios, we set both ,ukj and vkj
to be constant over j (i.e. genes) and to satisfy vkj = —,ukj so that
all the DE genes have a common absolute mean expression level,
which intuitively represents the effect size (i.e. how strong the
signal is). In the ﬁrst scenario, two studies with the same effect
size are considered; and we vary the degree of the effect size at
two different levels. In the second scenario, again, two studies are
considered but with different effect sizes. In the third, four stu-
dies instead of two are considered and everything else is the same
as the ﬁrst scenario. In the last two scenarios, we consider vary-
ing effect sizes across genes; that is, ,ukj or vkj is no longer con-
stant over j and they are generated from independent normal
distributions with the same absolute mean. The fourth scenario
considers two studies with the same mean of the effect sizes,
while the ﬁfth considers two studies with different means of
the effect sizes. The details of the simulation settings are
summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

In total, 100 independent datasets are generated for each ﬁxed
parameter set {2, or, ,ukj, vkj}. For each simulated dataset, we run
MCMC and then calculate o for our proposed method, and
compute the Q values for the three MAPEs. For a fair compari-
son in power, we control the test size (i.e. the type I error) at the
level 0.05 for all the methods. To do so, for each of the methods
and each setting, we obtain the 5th percentile from the empirical
distribution of the corresponding statistic [i.e. (l — (5) for the
Bayesian model and Q values for the MAPEs] using the 100
datasets generated with the null-case parameter set
{2,05 = 0.10, ,ukj, vkj}, and use it as the cutoff value to declare
whether the gene set is enriched or not. Then the power of each
method is estimated by the proportion of datasets in which the
gene set is found to be enriched.

Figure 2 displays the power comparison results for Scenario
1—2. Figures of Scenario 3—5 are included in Supplementary
Material (Supplementary Figs Sl—S3). In all cases of Scenario
1, the proposed method has higher power than the MAPEs, es-
pecially when the enrichment signal is weak (i.e. the proportion or
of DE genes in the gene set is relatively close to that in the whole
genome). All methods tend to have increased power when )t in-
creases. However, the power of the proposed method improves

more rapidly than the MAPEs when or is 0.15, and it does not
change much when or is 0.25 because the power is close to one
regardless of A. When the enrichment signal or is increased, all the
four methods appear to have increased power. However, the
MAPEs seem to be much more sensitive to the change of or
than the Bayesian method. When the effect size is one, the
power of the Bayesian method is almost one in nearly all the
cases while the power of MAPE_P, the best of its kind, reaches
one only when the sampling rate A is one and the DE gene pro-
portion of the gene set (or) is 0.25. We also test cases (results not
reported) in which the effect size is more than one (2 or 4). We
ﬁnd that for large effect sizes, the Bayesian method always has
power equal to one, while the MAPEs do not, although their
performance improves substantially and the differences between
the Bayesian method and MAPEs become small, especially for
large A or or. In real microarray studies, the signal-to-noise ratio
may be low owing to the high noise level and may vary across
different studies. Therefore, in Scenario 2, the effect size of one
study is set to be relatively small. In this case we still have similar
ﬁndings as Scenario 1. In Scenario 3 (Supplementary Fig. S1), as
the number of studies increases from two to four, the power
tends to increase for all the four methods compared with
Scenario 1, and the Bayesian method still has higher power
than the other three in nearly all the cases. Further, similar ob-
servations as in the ﬁrst two scenarios can be made from results
for Scenarios 4 and 5 (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3), where the
effect sizes are random across genes in component studies.

4.2 Simulation II

We want to compare the sensitivity and speciﬁcity of our model
with MAPEs when there are multiple gene sets including both
non-enriched and enriched sets. Two studies are considered and
each study contains 40 samples, of which the ﬁrst 20 are controls
and the remaining 20 are cases. Suppose there are 1000 genes in
the genome. The ﬁrst 200 genes are UR genes, the last 200 are
DR genes and the middle 600 are EE genes. See Supplementary
Table S2a for how we generate expression data for these genes. A
total of 100 gene sets are generated in this simulation, where the
ﬁrst 30 sets are enriched by UR genes, the next 30 are enriched
by DR genes and the last 40 are non-enriched sets. See
Supplementary Table S2b for how we generate these gene sets.
In each gene set, UR, DR and EE genes are randomly selected
from their corresponding gene populations. We set
A e {0.4,0.6,0.8, l} as before.

The ROC curves for identifying enriched gene sets in
Simulation II are shown in Figure 3. When the sampling rate A
is 1, all methods work well. However, when )t < 1, it is clear that
the proposed method outperforms any of the MAPE methods.
When the sampling rate (A) is 0.4, the area under the curve
(AUC) of the Bayesian method equals 0.97, while those of
MAPE_P, MAPE_G and MAPE_I are 0.88, 0.67 and 0.85, re-
spectively. If the sampling rate is 0.6 or 0.8, the ROC curve of the
Bayesian model becomes perfect while the MAPEs do not. The
results show that the proposed model is useful when the gene
coverage is widely different among component studies in the
meta-analysis, which agrees with the observation in Simulation I.

4.3 Simulation 111

We examine the robustness of the proposed method to deviations
from the normality assumption in (l) for gene expression inten-
sities and compare its performance with MAPEs when this as-
sumption is not satisﬁed. The simulation settings are the same as
in Simulation II except that we simulate the expression values of
DE genes for cases from t and Gamma distributions, instead of
normal distributions. It is known that a t-distribution has heavier
tails than the standard normal distribution and a Gamma

Bayesian meta-analysis of gene set enrichment studies

 

distribution is skewed. For the t-distribution setting, the expres-
sion intensities for cases are simulated using a t4(0,1) random
variable plus a location shift. For the UR/DR genes, the shift is
2/—2 in study one and l.5/—1.5 in study two. In the Gamma
setting, expression intensities of UR genes for cases are from
Gamma (2,2) in study one and from Gamma (1.5,2) for study
two. The expression intensities of DR genes for cases are generated
from the same Gamma distribution as UR genes in the same study,
but with a negative sign. Similar to Simulation II, ROC curves
(Supplementary Figs S4 and S5) are compared for all the four
methods with the sampling rate )1 = 0.4, 0.6, 0.8 and l, and their
corresponding AUC values are displayed in Table 1. It is clear that
the proposed Bayesian model uniformly outperforms the other
three methods in both t and Gamma distribution settings for all
)1 except for )1 = l, where all methods work well and have compar-
able performance. The simulation results suggest that the proposed
Bayesian approach is not sensitive to mild or moderate deviations
from the normality assumption for the expression intensities.

5 DATA EXAMPLE

The model is applied to eight independent lung cancer datasets
and our goal is to ﬁnd enriched gene sets/pathways related to
lung cancer. All of the datasets are pre-processed by Robust
Multi-array Average (RMA) (Irizarry et al., 2003) and are
log2—transformed. Patients in all datasets are classiﬁed into two
groups based on their survival time, using the R package ‘pamr’
(Hastie et al., 2011); see Supplementary Section S2 for detail. To
avoid the heterogeneity in molecular mechanisms caused by the
tumor subtypes, only patients with lung adenocarcinoma are
considered. The names, sources and sample sizes of these
datasets are displayed in Supplementary Table S3. A total of
186 C2 curated KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012) pathways from
MSigDB (Subramaniana et al., 2005) are considered in this ana-
lysis. To better evaluate the results, 20 test gene sets, including 10
positive controls and 10 negative controls, are generated as fol-
lows. Positive control gene sets are from a list of genes that are
believed to be highly related to the lung cancer (see
Supplementary Table S4), while the negative control gene sets
are randomly generated from the genes that are not included in
the positive control gene list or involved in any KEGG gene set.

Expression intensities of DE genes for cases are drawn from t and Gamma
distributions.

We calculate gigs, the estimated posterior enrichment probabil-
ities deﬁned in Section 3 from the MCMC samples, and plot
(1 — (5,) in Figure 4a. Convergence detection is done using stand-
ard graphic tools (trace and density plots) and the commonly
used Gehnan and Rubin diagnostic (Gelman and Rubin,
1992). For comparison, we ﬁrst apply the three MAPE methods
with the default option that uses the maximum P—value statistic,
and ﬁnd that none of them can identify any enriched pathways
including those positive controls, even when we set the cutoff of
the Q-values as high as 0.5. So we proceed to apply the MAPEs
with two other available options: the minimum P—value statistic
(minP) and the Fisher’s statistic (Fisher), and we ﬁnd the MAPE_I
method appears to perform better than or comparable with
MAPE_P and MAPE_G in identifying positive controls while
avoiding negative controls. So we report results for MAPE_I
with the minimum P—value statistic (labeled MAPE_I_minP)
and MAPE_I with the Fisher’s statistic (labeled
MAPE_I_Fisher), and plot their Q-values in Figure 4b and c,
respectively. We use (1 —q5g) <0.05 in our Bayesian method,
and use Q-value I 0.05 in the MAPE_I algorithms as the thresholds
to ﬁnd enriched pathways. Figure 4a clearly shows that, in the
Bayesian method, the gigs for all positive control sets are equal to
one while the gigs for all negative control sets are close to or lower
than 0.2. Thus, it correctly identiﬁes all the positive controls as
well as excluding all the negative controls. As shown in Figure 4b,
MAPE_I_minP can identify all positive control pathways.
However, it mistakenly claims that a negative control set is en-
riched. MAPE_I_Fisher fails to detect seven positive control sets
although it correctly excludes all negative control sets (Fig. 4c). In
Figure 5, we compare the numbers of enriched pathways via a
Venn Diagram, which shows that the Bayesian model detects
more enriched pathways than the MAPE_I methods.

A list of selected pathways identiﬁed by the proposed model
are displayed in Supplementary Table S5 along with their poster-
ior probabilities and Q-values of the two MAPE_I algorithms.
These pathways can be classiﬁed into three groups. The ﬁrst is the
consensus group whose member pathways can be identiﬁed by all
the three methods. Examples in this group include ‘non—small cell
lung cancer’, ‘nucleotide excision repair’ and ‘DNA replication’,

Fig. 6. Empirical distributions of P—values from the Fisher’s combined
probability tests for genes in selected pathways. The two pathways on the
top have posterior enrichment probability estimated by one, and the
bottom two are randomly chosen from the 10 positive control sets

which play important roles in lung cancer. The second group of
pathways are detectable by the Bayesian and MAPE_I_Fisher
methods, but not by MAPE_I_minP. This group includes, for
example, ‘pathways in cancer’ and ‘mTOR signaling pathway’.
The ‘mTOR signaling pathway’ is an important signal transduc-
tion pathway in cell apoptosis and survival, and it has been a
therapeutic target for lung cancer (LoPiccolo et al., 2008). The
third group contains those identiﬁed by the proposed method but
missed by the two MAPE_I algorithms. For instance, ‘vascular
endothelial growth factor (V EGF) signaling pathway’ belongs to
this group. The VEGFs are known to play a prominent role
during blood vessel formation. Importantly, tumor cells release
VEGF that induces tumor neovascularization. Thus, this path-
way is well established to be a target for antitumor therapy
(Kowanetz and Ferrara, 2006). Another example is ‘transforming
growth factor-beta (TGF-ﬂ) signaling pathway’. TGF-,B and its
signaling effectors are key factors in determining cancer cell be-
havior. It is reported that the TGF-,B signaling pathway can act as
a tumor suppressor as well as a promoter of tumor progression
and invasion (Derynck et al., 2001). While it took several previous
studies to ﬁnd these lung cancer-related pathways, our proposed
method successfully captures them in one single meta-analysis. In
addition, those pathways identiﬁed by the proposed method, but
not yet discovered by existing studies, may be worth future
biological investigation and validation.

To further examine the results from our Bayesian method, we
use a popular method, SAM-t (Tusher et al., 2001), to test dif-
ferential messenger RNA expression and derive a P—value for
each individual gene in each study. Then the Fisher’s combined
probability test statistic, i.e. —2 Zklog(pjk>, is computed to

combine the SAM-t P—values for each single gene from all stu-
dies. Finally, after performing a X2 test, we obtain a P—value from
the Fisher’s combined test for each gene. For genes in enriched
sets, we would expect that many such P—values would be rela-
tively low. Figure 6 shows P—values from the Fisher’s combined
tests for genes in two pathways with estimated posterior prob-
abilities of enrichment equal to one and two randomly chosen
positive control sets. From Figure 6, we can see that the two
identiﬁed pathways in the top panel and the two positive control
sets in the bottom panel all have a large number of genes with
small P—values. It indicates that these four pathways have high
percentages of DE genes. Supplementary Figure S6 shows the
Fisher’s P—values for the genes in another four pathways with
estimated posterior enrichment probabilities equal to 0.09, 0.10,
0.13 and 0.11, respectively. Unlike the pathways in Figure 6, the
distributions of P—values in these four pathways are not skewed
to the left, suggesting that they are not likely to be enriched. This
observation agrees with their low estimates of the posterior
probabilities of enrichment.

6 DISCUSSION

We have proposed a fully integrated Bayesian model for
meta-analysis of gene set enrichment using multiple genomic
studies, and developed an efﬁcient Gibbs sampler for posterior
computation and inference, where all the steps can be done by
direct sampling from known distributions. Through simulation
studies and experimental data, we have shown that compared
with the existing methods, our approach can substantially im-
prove the power of detecting enriched gene sets, especially for
non-easy situations when the effect size is not large, gene over-
lapping rate is low or enrichment signal is weak. The perform-
ance gain of the proposed method may be attributed to the
following ideas behind our model-based approach: (i) explicit
modeling of between-study heterogeneities for gene expression
data; (ii) the capability of including non-overlapping genes in
the model; and (iii) joint modeling of gene set information and
expression data from multiple studies, which may utilize the
available information more efﬁciently than the MAPEs that syn-
thesize summary statistics only. Note that (iii) is closely related to
our previous work (W ang et al., 2012) but the focus of that paper
was on a single genomic study with different data structures.
Another advantage of our method is that it does not need the
so-called gene-sampling scheme. As argued in Goeman and
Buhlmann (2007), this scheme is implicitly required for compu-
tation or correct interpretation of P—values in the GSEA-like
methods or 2 x 2 table methods, and is subject to the criticism
that it is unrealistic. Instead, our Bayesian model makes every
assumption clear; and it relies on posterior probabilities for iden-
tifying enriched gene sets, which reﬂect uncertainties after obser-
ving data and can be interpreted naturally without the
gene-sampling scheme.

Computational efﬁciency is an important aspect of Bayesian
modeling. Here we report the computing time of our simulation
studies. It takes between 3 and 10 min, depending on the sam-
pling rate A, to run 4000 MCMC iterations for each dataset
involving two studies in Simulation I using one thread on a
Red Hat Enterprise Linux workstation with 4 Xeon(R) CPUs
@267 GHz and 5.8 GB of memory. We also monitor the

Bayesian meta-analysis of gene set enrichment studies

 

convergence of the MCMC processes, and the results suggest
that the proposed Bayesian model converges relatively fast. In
addition, under the non-informative prior setups, our algorithm
can become a fully automated procedure that does not require
any tuning parameter. This is convenient for an end user with
little or no statistical training. However, if meaningful prior
knowledge is available, certain features of the proposed
method may be changed to produce potentially better results
that incorporate such knowledge.

In a nutshell of the Bayesian framework, our method can be
extended and some of the model assumptions can be relaxed, to
allow for more modeling ﬂexibility. First, motivated by the ap-
plication in Section 5, we assume a common variance of error for
all genes in study k. This is to avoid over-parameterization and
help the variance estimation when some studies in meta-analysis
lack enough samples to produce stable estimates of the gene-wise
variances. However, for individual studies with sufﬁcient sam-
ples, this assumption can be relaxed by using gene-speciﬁc vari-
ances ojzks instead of 0,3 in (1). The Gibbs sampler can be
modiﬁed readily; see the end of Supplementary Section S1 for
detailed changes. Second, with minor adaption in the model and
algorithm, the method can be also applied to paired expression
data (such as those generated using two-channel arrays) besides
two-sample expression data discussed in the article; see Chapter 4
of Zang (2012) for detail. Last, we assume that a gene shares the
same differential status across studies as in the MAPE methods.
This assumption may be plausible when all the studies in meta-
analysis address the exactly same underlying biological question
and they are conducted in similar experimental conditions. On
the other hand, there exist situations where the true status of
some genes can vary across studies. If one applies the proposed
method directly here, these genes may need to be removed, when
possible, from the gene pool before application, as suggested by
one of the reviewers. To formally handle such situations, we can
extend our Bayesian model by adding a layer of hierarchy (e.g.
model the study-speciﬁc status of gene j as a random variable
with probability wJDE to be DE in each study). Such extension
would change the model, the joint posterior distribution and
MCMC algorithm. Clearly, there is ample space for future
work to deal with this issue.

In meta-analysis, it is critical to carefully review and choose
studies because inclusion of data with poor quality might lead to
biased results or loss of efﬁciency. Thus, we recommend readers
to follow strict procedures of critical review of the literature
before applying any meta-analysis model. Finally, we mention
that one limitation of the proposed method is that, unlike
MAPEs, binary phenotypes/conditions are required in our ana-
lysis. Nonetheless, there exist a wide range of applications that
meet this requirement.

Aetiology and classification of
adenocarcinoma of the gastro-
oesophageal iunction/cardia

Kenneth E L McColl,1 James J Goingz

The gastro—oesophageal junction (including
the proximal cardia region of the stomach)
is an anatomical site with a remarkably
high and rapidly rising incidence of adeno—
carcinoma.1 Understanding the aetiology of
cancer at this site and its relationship to
adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and of
the stomach poses a challenge to surgeons,
gastroenterologists and pathologists.
Determining the origin of these cancers is of
more than academic interest as their
surgical management depends upon
whether they are derived from the oesoph—
agus or the stomach?—4

In 1996, Siewert er a] proposed a classi—
fication of gastro—oesophageal junction
adenocarcinomas based upon their loca—
tion relative to the gastro—oesophageal
junction identified by the proximal margin
of the gastric folds.4 5 Castro—oesophageal
junction cancers were considered to be
those whose centre lay between 5 cm
proximal to and 5 cm distal to the gastro—
oesophageal junction. Siewert er a] subdi—
vided these gastro—oesophageal junction
cancers into type I if the tumour centre lay
1—5 cm proximal to the gastro—oesopha—
geal junction, type II if between 1 cm
proximal and 1cm distal to the junction
and type III if 1—5 cm distal to the junc—
tion. This classification has been interna—
tionally recognised and is used by surgeons
to plan management of the tumour.2 3

Siewert type 1 adenocarinomas have
epidemiological and histological character—
istics similar to oesophageal adenocarci—
nomas, including a marked male
predominance, an association with a history
of reflux symptoms and predominance of
intestinal type Lauren histology.2 5 In
contrast, Siewert type III adenocarcinomas
resemble distal (non—cardia) gastric cancers
with less marked male dominance, a similar

proportion of intestinal and diffuse histo—
logical types and no association with
reflux.5 Type I junctional adenocarcinomas
are therefore considered to be oesophageal
cancers which happen to be located in the
distal oesophagus and type III junctional
cancers to be gastric cancers which happen
to be in the cardia. Siewert type II adeno—
carcinomas (centred within 1cm of the
gastro—oesophageal junction) have epide—
miological and histological characteristics
intermediate between those of type I and
type III cancers. The Siewert classification
does not advance our understanding of the
aetiology of this particular subset of
adenocarcinomas.

Adenocarcinomas arising within 1 cm of
the gastro—oesophageal junction occur
commonly, so their aetiology and classifi—
cation are important. Are they of hetero—
geneous aetiology? Do some of them arise
in short or ultrashort Barrett’s segments,
making them true oesophageal adenocarci—
nomas? Do others arise from the most
proximal stomach, making them true
gastric cancers? Alternatively, do junctional
cancers have an aetiology distinct from
both oesophageal adenocarcinoma and
more distal (non—cardia) gastric cancer?

The fact that junctional cancers have
epidemiological and histological charac—
teristics between those of oesophageal and
non—cardia gastric adenocarcinoma would
be consistent with heterogeneous aetiol—
ogies, with some being oesophageal
adenocarcinoma and others gastric carci—
nomas.6 7 If so, the challenge is to differ—
entiate junctional cancers into those of
gastric and those of oesophageal origin. If
this could be done, it would be possible to
simplify the classification of adenocarci—
noma of the upper gastrointestinal tract
into two types—oesophageal adenocarci—
nomas and gastric adenocarcinomas.

Our improved understanding of the aeti—
ology and pathogenesis of oesophageal
adenocarcinoma and non—cardia gastric
cancer over recent decades may be the key to
classifying junctional adenocarcinomas.
N on—cardia gastric adenocarcinomas, which
may be of intestinal, diffuse or mixed Lauren

type,8 are associated with Helz'cobacter pylori—
induced atrophic gastritis and intestinal
metaplasia, and the intestinal subtype is
thought to arise from the latter.9 Oeso—
phageal adenocarcinomas nearly always
have an intestinal histological type, having
arisen from Barrett’s intestinal metaplasia,
secondary to gastro—oesophageal reflux.10
While oesophageal adenocarcinoma and the
intestinal subtype of non—cardia gastric
adenocarcinoma are themselves histologi—
cally indistinguishable, gastric mucosa well
clear of the carcinoma is strikingly different
between the two. In patients with non—
cardia gastric adenocarcinoma of the intes—
tinal subtype the mucosa of the rest of the
stomach usually shows a body—predomi—
nant or pangastritis, with atrophy, intes—
tinal metaplasia and low or absent acid
secretion.9 11—17 In contrast, in patients
with oesophageal adenocarcinoma, the
gastric mucosa is usually healthy, without
any H. pylori gastritis and able to secrete
normal or high amounts of acid.18 19

We have investigated whether the state of
the gastric mucosa well clear of the tumour
might indicate whether junctional adeno—
carcinomas are of two distinct aetiologies,
with some resembling oesophageal adeno—
carcinomas and others resembling non—
cardia gastric adenocarcinomas.9 In a nested
case—control study, we examined serolog—
ical evidence of H pylori infection and atro—
phic gastritis (pepsinogen I/II) in patients
with adenocarcinoma within 2 cm of the
gastro—oesophageal junction and patients
with non—cardia gastric cancers.9 Patients
with non—cardia gastric cancer had lower
pepsinogen I/II ratios than controls,
consistent with this cancer being strongly
associated with gastric atrophy. Pepsinogen
I/II values were normally distributed in
controls and patients with non—cardia
gastric cancers, in keeping with the latter
being a homogeneous group.

The mean pepsinogen I/II value in the
junctional cancers was similar to that of
their controls but, whereas values in the
control group were normally distributed,
the junctional cancers had a non—normal
distribution with a wide range of values.
When the H pylori—positive junctional
cancers were compared with H pylori—
positive controls, the junctional cancers
showed a significant association with
gastric atrophy. This finding supported the
concept of junctional cancers being of
heterogeneous aetiology, with some
resembling non—cardia gastric cancer in
being associated with H pylori—induced
atrophic gastritis and others having no
association, or even a negative association,
with gastric atrophy.

In a further study, we examined the
association of junctional adenocarcinoma
with serological evidence of atrophy as
well as with reflux symptoms, comparing
it with that seen in patients with oeso—
phageal adenocarcinoma and with non—
cardia gastric cancer.20 In keeping with
previous observations, oesophageal
adenocarcinomas showed a strong associ—
ation with reflux symptoms but not with
gastric atrophy, while non—cardia gastric
cancers showed a strong association with
atrophy but not with reflux symptoms. In
contrast, junctional adenocarcinomas were
positively associated with severe gastric
atrophy and severe reflux symptoms, but
importantly the association with reflux
symptoms was confined to those without
evidence of gastric atrophy. We believe this
observation is again indicative of junc—
tional adenocarcinomas having two
distinct aetiologies, with some resembling
oesophageal adenocarcinoma and others
resembling non—cardia gastric cancer.

A third study performed by Ren er a]
further supports junctional adenocarcinomas
being of two distinct aetiologies.21 This study
examined the association of gastric atrophy
with junctional versus non—cardia gastric
cancers The study was performed in China
where Barrett’s oesophagus and oesophageal
adenocarcinomas are extremely rare. If
cancers of the gastro—oesophageal junction
are either oesophageal adenocarcinomas or
gastric adenocarcinomas aetiologically similar
to non—cardia gastric cancer then in a part of
the world where oesophageal adenocarci—
noma is extremely rare, all junctional cancers
should show the same positive association
with atrophy as non—cardia gastric cancers.

This was indeed the case, with junctional
cancers having an association with atrophy
similar to more distal gastric cancers.

If junctional cancers are either oesophageal
adenocarcinomas which are negatively asso—
ciated with H pylori18 19 or cancers of similar
aetiology to non—cardia gastric cancers, which
we know are positively associated with H
pylori,” then there should be different asso—
ciations between junctional adenocarci—
nomas and H pylori in different parts of the
world. In the developed world where the
ratio of oesophageal adenocarcinoma to non—
cardia gastric cancer is relatively high,
a substantial proportion of junctional cancers
lead to a relatively weak association between
junctional cancer and H pylori infection. In
contrast, in the developing world where the
ratio of oesophageal to non—cardia gastric
adenocarcinoma is low, there should be
a strong relationship between junctional
cancers and H pylori. In the meta—analysis
by the Eurogast Study Group, it was indeed
observed that though there was no global
association between junctional cancers and
H pylori, there was a strong tendency for
a negative association in studies from the
Western world but a positive association in
studies from the East.23

There is therefore now substantial evidence
indicating that adenocarcinomas at the
gastro—oesophageal junction are of two
distinct aetiologies, with some being oeso—
phageal adenocarcinomas probably arising
from short or ultrashort Barrett’s oesophagus
and the others being gastric adenocarcinomas
caused by H pylori infection and atrophic
gastritis, as with cardia gastric cancers.

The challenge now is to determine
whether an adenocarcinoma arising at the

gastro—oesophageal junction is oesopha—
geal or gastric. As recognised by Siewert
er a], when the cancer is close to the gastro—
oesophageal junction it is usually
impossible to determine from inspection of
the cancer and the surrounding mucosa
whether it has arisen from the proximal
stomach or a short Barrett’s segment.3_5
The key to correct classification is likely to
be the differences which exist between
oesophageal and gastric cancer with
respect to epidemiology, pathogenesis and
sometimes tumour histology (figure 1).

The first thing to consider is the histology
of the cancer itself. If it is of pure Lauren
diffuse histological subtype, then it is almost
certainly a gastric cancer as this histology is
rarely, if ever, seen in true oesophageal
adenocarcinomas.10 The greater challenge is
determining the origin of the adenocarci—
nomas of the intestinal histological subtype.
Oesophageal and gastric adenocarcinomas
of intestinal subtype are histologically
indistinguishable, having arisen on a back—
ground of intestinal metaplasia. Hopes that
cytol<eratin 7 and 20 immunophenotypes
might differentiate between intestinal
metaplasia or indeed between adenocarci—
noma of gastric versus oesophageal origin
have unfortunately not been realised.24_30
Other groups have investigated whether
Barrett’s and gastric adenocarcinomas can
be differentiated by comparative genomic
hybridisation. Deletion of 14q31—32.1 as
a marker of Barrett’s adenocarcinoma has
not been confirmed.31_84

of the cancer itself but the histology of the
stomach well clear of the cancer. Gastric
cancers are strongly associated with
mucosal atrophy, intestinal metaplasia
and body—predominantHWZorz' gastritis.9 11—17
In contrast, oesophageal adenocarcinomas
occur in subjects with healthy non—atrophic
gastric mucosa.18 19 It is important not only to
biopsy a junctional carcinoma itself but,
whenever possible, also to biopsy the gastric
antrum and corpus for atrophy, intestinal
metaplasia and body—predominant gastritis,
the presence of which will strongly suggest
that an adenocarcinoma is of gastric origin.

The other readily available information
which may further help determine
whether an intestinal—type adenocarci—
noma at the gastro—oesophageal junction
is gastric or oesophageal in origin is the
history of reflux symptoms. A significant
reflux history points to oesophageal
adenocarcinoma, for which reflux symp—
toms are a risk factor,85 whereas patients
with gastric cancer associated with
H pylori atrophic gastritis are protected
from acid reflux.36 37 Unfortunately, the
gender of the patient is unlikely to be
helpful as recent studies indicate a similar
male predominance of intestinal—type
adenocarcinoma of the stomach and
oesophagus, in both due to a 15—20 year
lag in cancer development in females.10

In summary, recent evidence indicates that
adenocarcinomas of the gastro—oesophageal
junction have two distinct aetiologies, one
shared with oesophageal adenocarcinoma and
the other with non—cardia gastric adenocarci—
noma. Despite morphological and histological
similarities, these two cancers arising at the
gastro—oesophageal junction differ profoundly
in their aetiology and origin, one being oeso—
phageal and one gastric. It is important to
separate oesophageal from gastric junctional
cancers to allow meaningful epidemiological
analysis and to guide surgical management.
The two cancers may also respond differently
to other treatment modalities such as
chemotherapy and endoscopic mucosal
resection, and studies of such treatments
should be analysed by the likely origin of the
lesion treated. Appropriate classification of
most junctional cancers can be achieved by
examining key indicators (figure 1). The
terms “gastro—oesophageal junction”, “junc—
tional” and “cardia” adenocarcinoma should
be discarded, with all adenocarcinomas
arising around the oesophogastric junction
being classified as “oesophageal” or “gastric”
and their location in the relevant organ given.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transposable elements (TEs) are found in both prokaryotic and
eukaryotic organisms. TEs have caused profound structural and
functional changes to genomes, where they continue to persist in
and shape the evolution of the host. The molecular domestication
of TEs in eukaryotic organisms has resulted in viral immunity
against murine leukemia virus in Mus species (Best et al., 1996),
the maintenance of telomeres in Drosophila (Pardue and DeB aryshe,
2008) and has contributed to site—speciﬁc V(D)J recombination in
jawed vertebrates [see Sinzelle et al. (2009) for review]. Although
the majority of TEs are not currently active, their historical activity
led to TE—derived polymorphisms. The currently active TEs are a
major driving force for genome evolution and revealing TE activity
is also essential to understanding genome evolution (Kidwell and
Lisch, 1997).

One method to reveal genome—wide insertions caused by TEs
is Transposon Display (TD). This technique is a modiﬁcation of a
previously described technique referred to as Ampliﬁed Fragment
Length Polymorphism (AFLP; den Broeck et al., 1998; Vos et al.,
1995). TD starts with the digestion of genomic DNA with a
restriction enzyme. Adapter oligonucleotides are then ligated to the
digested genomic DNA fragments. The ﬁrst round of ampliﬁcation
(pre—ampliﬁcation) is performed using a primer complementary to
the adapter sequence and another primer complementary to the target
TE. A second, selective PCR reaction is often performed using
the pre—ampliﬁcation products as templates with a nested primer
set. Selective ampliﬁcation PCR products are analyzed by gel or
capillary electrophoresis. If a TE family has a high copy number
in a genome, selective nucleotide(s) can be added to the 3’ end of
the adapter primer used in the selective ampliﬁcation, reducing the

number of bands per lane (den Broeck et al., 1998). The approximate
copy number of a TE family in a genome can be estimated from
the number of bands. Differences in banding patterns reveal TE
insertion polymorphisms between individuals (Schaack et al., 2010;
Valizadeh and Crease, 2008). Current TE transposition activity in
an individual organism may be inferred from the appearance of new
bands on a TD gel (Jiang et al., 2003; Slotkin et al., 2009).

Here, we describe a computational algorithm that follows the
conceptual principles of TD. The program, called TE Displayer, has
a graphical user interface and runs on Windows and Linux operating
systems (Supplementary Fig. 1). The output includes a virtual gel
image and detailed genomic location information for each band. TE
Displayer was tested using TEs in the Aedes aegypti, Drosophila
melanogaster, Caenorhabditis elegans, Arabidopsis thaliana and
Oryza sativa genomes and all of the output from TE Displayer is
consistent with the output from manual inspection.

2 RESULTS

2.1 Algorithm and implementation

The required parameters to perform TD experiments include the
restriction enzyme, the pre—ampliﬁcation primer sequences, the
selective ampliﬁcation primer sequences, the size of the adaptor
oligonucleotides and the selective base(s). To simulate TD procedure
in silico, the genomic coordinates of each location harbouring
a target TE element are retrieved with BLAST searches from
genome sequences using the TE—speciﬁc pre—ampliﬁcation primer
as the query sequence [Fig. 1A (i)]. Mismatches between the
pre—ampliﬁcation primer and the genomic sequence are allowed.
Because pre—ampliﬁcation in TD is performed with enzymatically
digested genomic DNA, the resulting amplicon is comprised of
the sequence between the pre—ampliﬁcation primer and the ﬁrst
restriction site. Therefore, the next step in the algorithm is to locate
the ﬁrst restriction site from the pre—ampliﬁcation primer location.
This is achieved by retrieving a 5 kb ﬂanking sequence followed
by searching for the nearest restriction site [Fig. 1A (ii), (iii)]. The
sequence between the pre—ampliﬁcation primer and the restriction
site is scanned for the presence of the TE—speciﬁc selective primer
[Fig. 1A (iv)]. If a selective primer sequence is found and is in the
correct orientation, the size of the conceptual amplicon is calculated
as the combined sizes of the selective primer, adaptor and the region
between them [Fig. 1A (v)]. Every location harbouring a target TE
is processed and a conceptual amplicon is produced.

For each amplicon, the genomic location, amplicon size, selective
base and the number of mismatches are recorded in a text ﬁeld of the
graphical interface. In addition, all the conceptual amplicons from
a genome are presented as bands in a virtual gel lane (Fig. 1B—E).

The mobility of a DNA fragment on acrylamide gel is inversely
proportional to its size. Therefore, the positions of the bands are
calculated using the formula D1/D2=S2/S 1, where D is distance
and S is size.

2.2 Display TE families in different genomes

To test TE Displayer, we displayed elements of different hAT
families in ﬁve genomes: Athaliana, C.elegans, 0.sativa, A.aegypti
and D.melan0gaster. Detailed information on primer sequences
and other parameters is provided in the Supplementary Material.
Because each TE family differs in sequence, each primer set
generates a unique banding pattern on the virtual gel, as expected
(Fig. 1B). The copy number of each family, reﬂected as the number
of bands in a virtual gel lane, and the size of each band were
consistent with manual inspection of the genomic sequences.

TE Displayer can be used to compare the proﬁles of a TE family in
different but closely related genomes. Virtual gels for mPing were
generated using two completed rice (0.sativa) genome sequences
(Fig. 1C). In the 0.sativa var. indica genome, there are only nine
mPing elements that resolve on the virtual gel, compared with 33 in
the 0.sativa var. japonica genome. This is consistent with previous
data (Jiang et al., 2003), which shows signiﬁcantly more mPing
copies in the japonica variety than the indica variety.

TE Displayer allows mismatches between the pre—ampliﬁcation
primer and the genomic sequence, a source of non—speciﬁc bands in
TD analysis. When displaying the TF000720 TE family in A.aegypti,
four bands appeared on the virtual gel image when no primer
mismatches were permitted. With one and two primer mismatches,
33 and 37 bands appeared, respectively (Fig. 1D, Supplementary
Table 2). For analyses of TE families with high copy numbers, users

may choose selective base(s) to reduce the number of bands per lane,
resulting in an increased resolution of each band (Fig. 1E).

3 METHODS

The algorithm was implemented with PERL. BLAST search is performed
with the standalone program package 2.2.22 with an E —value of 10 000. The
modules Perl/T k is used to implement the graphical interface (Supplementary
Fig. 2). GD—2.43 module was used to generate the virtual gel images. BioPerl
modules including StandAloneBlast and Bio: :SearchIO were used to perform
BLAST search and parse the output. TE Displayer was tested on Linux and
Windows (XP, Vista, 7) standalone systems and the SciNet high performance
system (University of Toronto).

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

Emerging sequencing technologies promise high efﬁciency and
low cost. Whole—genome deep sequencing is becoming a routine
procedure and will beneﬁt studies of TEs. TE Displayer for post—
genomic analyses of TEs enables quick retrieval of TE—derived
polymorphisms in large datasets, providing a link between in silico
analysis and experimental testing.

Discrepancies may be found between an in silico proﬁle and
one obtained from an experimental TD analysis. For example,
although the banding patterns of mPing between the TD gel and
the virtual gel image are similar, several bands differ. This may
be caused by transposition activity of the target TE family. Other
factors contributing to the discrepancy may include: (i) incomplete
genome sequences which may result in fewer bands on a TE
Displayer virtual gel image than that obtained from an experimental
analysis; (ii) sequencing errors and inaccuracy in genome sequence
assembly that may cause changes in band sizes; (iii) the non—speciﬁc
ampliﬁcation in experimental analyses caused by priming of non—
target sequences. Therefore, in addition to obtaining TE proﬁles from
genome sequences, TE Displayer may also be useful in detecting
transposition activity and sequencing or genome assembly errors.

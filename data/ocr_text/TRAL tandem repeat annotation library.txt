Abstract

Motivation: Currently, more than 40 sequence tandem repeat detectors are published, providing
heterogeneous, partly complementary, partly conflicting results.

Results: We present TRAL, a tandem repeat annotation library that allows running and parsing of
various detection outputs, clustering of redundant or overlapping annotations, several statistical
frameworks for filtering false positive annotations, and importantly a tandem repeat annotation
and refinement module based on circular profile hidden Markov models (cpHMMs). Using TRAL,
we evaluated the performance of a multi—step tandem repeat annotation workflow on 547085
sequences in UniProtKB/Swiss—Prot. The researcher can use these results to predict run—times for
specific datasets, and to choose annotation complexity accordingly.

Availability and implementation: TRAL is an open—source Python 3 library and is available, to—
gether with documentation and tutorials via http://vaw.vital—it.ch/software/traI.

1 Introduction

Tandem repeats (TRs) are sequence features, where motifs, or TR
units, are found right neXt to each other, often as imperfect repetitions
(Fig. 1A). Currently, more than 40 TR detector (TRD) programs eXist,
each focusing on different TR types and using different methodologies.
We have shown that currently available TRDs do not provide exhaust—
ive detections, and combining TRs from several TRDs is essential for
reliable TR annotation (Schaper et 61]., 2012). Therefore, a researcher
interested in TRs needs to handle all of the following tasks: (i)
Executing and parsing results of several TRDs, despite no commonly
accepted file format; (ii) Validating TR predictions and clustering re-
dundant or overlapping results; (iii) Filtering out false positive TR pre-
dictions in a robust statistical framework; (iv) Annotating known TRs
homogenously across homologous sequences, and discerning variation
among the TRs (Anisimova et 61]., 2015). Each of these tasks is

implemented in TRAL—an open source Python 3 TR annotation li—
brary. TRAL is highly modularized, such that a researcher can use the
implemented methods or customize them by adding other TRDs, over—
lap criteria, statistical tests or model—based annotation methods. The
software is designed to run efficiently and user-friendly on single ma-
chines as well as on large computing clusters. For a variety of work—
ﬂows, scripts and tutorials are available online.

2 Features and methods

An overview of the structure of TRAL is shown in Figure 1B.

2.1 Annotate with sequence profile models
A common task is to annotate sequences with TRs of a known
motif. This allows to study the evolution of the TR across sequence

classes: a sequence can contain TR lists; a TR list can contain TRs; a TR can contain a cpHMM. For different use cases, different workflows can be build using
these classes. For each class, input/output methods for a variety of formats are available. External software is described in the online documentation

homologues, or to check whether a common motif occurs in tandem
within a sequence.

TRAL implements a circular profile hidden Markov model
(cpHMM), adapting popular sequence profile models, e.g. from
HMMER (Eddy, 1998; Finn et al., 2011) to TRs (Bucher et al., 1996;
Schaper and Anisimova, 2015; Schaper et al., 2014; Uricaru et al.,
2007). Accurate TR annotation in the maximum likelihood frame-
work is realized with the Viterbi algorithm, such that homologous
TRs are homogenously annotated. As all TR annotations are
described by the same profile model, they are comparable in terms of
their characteristics (TR unit number, length, indels), enabling evolu—
tionary studies (Schaper et al., 2014). cpHMMs can be created from
single sequences, TRs or sequence profile models from databases.

2.2 Annotate with de novo tandem repeat detectors

For de 1101/0 annotations, we implemented a scaffold for executing
and parsing external TRD software. Six current TRDs are currently
integrated:

HHrepID (Biegert and S0ding, 2008), Phobos (www.ruhr—uni—
bochum.de/ecoevo/cm/cm_phobos.htm), TRED (Sokol et al., 2007),
T—REKS (Jorda and Kajava, 2009), TRF (Benson, 1999), TRUST
(Szklarczyk and Heringa, 2004) and XSTREAM (Newman and
Cooper, 2007). Further TRDs can easily be added to the framework.
As we noted that some TRDs sometimes propose TRs that are not
part of the input sequence, an automatic sanity check discards these.

Importantly, profile HMMs can be used to refine de 1101/0 TR an—
notations. For example, a TRD may correctly identify a TR, but not
capture all its TR units or the correct TR unit boundaries. The re—
finement can then be achieved by re—annotating with cpHMMs.

2.3 Identify and filter overlapping annotations

Different TRDs often predict overlapping TRs, and congruent pre—
dictions are very rare (Schaper et al., 2012). The user may be inter—
ested in discarding redundant TRs. However, not all overlapping
predictions describe a TR redundantly (Anisimova et al., 2015). We
included a ﬂexible system to establish overlap and clustering of TRs
in TRAL. Two definitions of overlap for a pair of TRs are currently
implemented: (i) having at least some characters in common and (ii)
having a common ancestry of at least one pair of characters in align-
ments of multiple TR units for both TRs. In the next step, the clus—
tered TR annotations can be filtered to contain only the best TR
representative from a cluster according to user—defined criteria.

2.4 Test and filter for statistical significance
Distinguishing true from false positive TR annotations is another
important task, which requires evaluating the statistical significance

of a TR annotation. Several ad 1906 and model—based statistics based
on the multiple alignment of TR units have been proposed for this
purpose (Schaper et al., 2012). TRAL implements these statistics, as
well as their null—distributions for random TRs, such that the statis—
tical significance of each TR (P—value) can be calculated.

2.5 Retrieve tandem repeat characteristics

For each putative TR, TRAL provides access to characteristics such
as TR unit alignments, TR unit length, number, divergence and indel
distribution. The TR unit alignment can be optimized with attached
external multiple sequence alignment software. Finally, TRAL can
be used to build cpHMMs from each TR for annotation of homolo-
gous TRs on other sequences, or for iterative optimization of the TR
annotation (see Section 2.1).

3 Performance evaluation

We evaluated the performance (runtime and memory requirements)
of different TR annotation tasks with TRAL for 547085 sequences
in UniProtKB/Swiss-Prot (Table 1). TRs were annotated with four
TRDs and with cpHMMs based on PFAM models (Punta et al.,
2011), and filtered for statistical significance and overlap. On aver—
age, such annotation required ~8 s per protein sequence, mostly de—
pending on the number and type of de 1101/0 TRDs used. For large
annotation projects requiring parallelization, TRAL includes an an-
notation workflow, which can be run with GC3Pie—an open—source

Abstract

Summary: We present ABAEnrichment, an R package that tests for expression enrichment in spe-
cific brain regions at different developmental stages using expression information gathered from
multiple regions of the adult and developing human brain, together with ontologically organized
structural information about the brain, both provided by the Allen Brain Atlas. We validate
ABAEnrichment by successfully recovering the origin of gene sets identified in specific brain cell-

types and developmental stages.

Availability and Implementation: ABAEnrichment was implemented as an R package and is avail-
able under GPL (2 2) from the Bioconductor website (http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.3/bioc/

htmI/ABAEnrichment.htm|).

1 Introduction

Functional enrichment analyses using ontologies such as the Gene
Ontology have been widely used to gain insight into the functions
and phenotypes influenced by sets of gene candidates that emerge
from various genome-wide screens. Patterns of gene expression
can be very informative about developmental processes and func-
tions taking place in particular organs or tissues, but this requires
extensive expression information, including component tissues
and developmental stages, to be available for the organ/tissue of
interest.

The Allen Human Brain Atlas projects have quantified gene ex-
pression in multiple regions of the human brain over the course of
brain development, and provide a valuable resource that can be used
to pinpoint sets of genes that are characteristic of particular brain re-
gions and/or developmental stages (Hawrylycz et al., 2012; Miller
et al., 2014; Allen Human Brain Atlas; human.brain-map.org and

BrainSpan Atlas of the Developing Human Brain; brainspan.org).
To date, the transcriptomes of multiple regions of the brains of adult
humans as well as brains from individuals at various developmental
stages have been measured (Supplementary Tables 51—54). None of
the tools developed to date (e.g. Brain Explorer, http://human.brain-
map.org/static/brainexplorer) allow for the statistical evaluation of
gene candidates in terms of expression enrichment in specific regions
or stages using an ontology. Here, we demonstrate the utility of a
tool to carry out enrichment analyses using the Allen Brain Atlas
information.

2 Methods

In order to perform ontology gene set enrichment analyses for
expression in specific brain regions it is necessary to assign to each
anatomical structure the genes that are expressed in that structure.

We apply an expression threshold to identify expressed genes in this
step. A workﬂow illustrating the entire data processing and enrich-
ment analyses is shown in Supplementary Figure S1.

2.1 Gene expression data

We used two human brain expression datasets provided by the Allen
Brain Atlas. First, gene expression in the adult human brain was
measured in six adult individuals using a microarray (Microarray
Survey, Oct. 2013 v.7, Supplementary Table S1), and consists of
normalized expression profiles for ~16 000 genes in 414 brain
regions (Microarray Data Normalization, March 2013 v.1 see Table
S2). Second, the developing human brain dataset consists of normal-
ized RNA-Seq expression measurement (RPKM, ‘RNA-Seq
Gencode v10 summarized to genes’) of ~17 000 genes from 42
human donors classified into 31 different developmental periods
ranging from 8 post-conceptual weeks to 40 years (Table S3). 16 of
the 26 available brain regions were sampled in donors of at least 20
different ages, while the remaining 10 brain regions were sampled in
fewer than five ages (Supplementary Tables S3 and S4, brainspan.
org).

2.2 Processing of expression data

For the adult human brain datasets the normalized expression esti-
mates for genes in brain regions were computed by averaging the
expression levels across all samples and probe sets for a given gene
and brain region (see Section 2.1). To increase the power to detect
developmental effects we restricted to the 16 brain regions sampled
in at least 20 age categories. When testing for expression enrich-
ment across five developmental stages (Supplementary Table S5)
we computed the mean RPKM expression value of a gene in all
samples for a given brain region and developmental stage. The
input expression datasets were provided by the Allen Brain Atlas
and the processed data are available via our data package
ABAData (http://bioconductor.org/packages/3.2/data/experiment/
html/ABAData.html).

2.3 Ontologies

The Allen Brain Atlas provides non-overlapping ontologies that de-
scribe the developing and adult human brain and contain 3317 and
1534 brain regions, respectively. Direct expression data for the
adult brain is available for 414 of the 1534 brain regions in the
corresponding ontology. Genes in brain regions without direct ex-
pression measurements are defined to be expressed if at least one
sub-region shows expression evidence for the given gene
(Supplementary Table S6). For the developing human brain we re-
stricted the corresponding ontology to the 16 brain regions with
expression data available for at least 20 age time points. When
including the superstructures inheriting expression data from these
16 brain regions, a total of 47 brain regions were used in the en-
richment analysis (Supplementary Table S6).

2.4 Enrichment analyses

Genes are annotated to brain regions using default or user-defined
expression cut-offs. Default cut-offs are the 10%-steps of expression
quantiles across all brain regions. The enrichment analysis is then
performed by the core function aba_enrich using either a hypergeo-
metric test or a Wilcoxon-rank sum test as implemented in FUNC
(Priifer et al., 2007, supplementary Figure 1). The full functionality
of our package is described in our Bioconductor R vignette: https://
bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/vignettes/ABAEnrichment/
inst/doc/ABAEnrichment.html

3 Evaluation

To determine whether our approach accurately identifies genes
that have previously been reported to show enrichment in different
brain regions we tested the software on two datasets (Cahoy et al.,
2008; Kang et al., 2011, supplementary data file). Cahoy et al. re-
port a set of marker genes for oligodendrocytes. We selected the
top 40 markers as candidates and tested for their enrichment in the
adult brain using ABAEnrichment. Oligodendrocytes have been re-
ported to be predominantly present in the white matter of the brain
(Hagan et al., 2012). Expression enrichment analysis indicated
that the 40 marker genes are significantly enriched in multiple re-
gions (min FWER< 0.05) of which the top five enriched regions
represent all white matter tissues available (Supplementary Table
S7). Secondly, we used genes that have been shown to be differen-
tially expressed at different developmental stages in multiple
human brain regions (Supplementary Table S8, Kang et al., 2011).
From the six brain regions Kang et al. reported, five were measured
directly for the Allen Brain Atlas and one (neocortex) has substruc-
tures with direct expression measurements (Supplementary Table
S9). Strikingly, when we restricted our analysis to regions where
we have direct expression evidence in all cases the region Kang
et al. reported had the lowest mean FWER across default expres-
sion cut-offs (Supplementary Table S10). For genes reported to be
specifically expressed in neocortex we find that the brain region
with the lowest mean FWER is in all cases a direct sub-region of
neocortex.

4 Conclusions

ABAEnrichment provides a method for analyzing gene set expres-
sion enrichment in the brain regions assayed by the Allan Brain
Atlas projects, and is the first software package to perform
genome-wide analyses using this resource. We show that it is pos-
sible to use the fine-grained expression profiles provided by the
Allen Brain Atlas projects to determine whether sets of candidate
genes identified through analyses such as screens for positive se-
lection (Scheinfeldt and Tishkoff, 2013), genome-wide association
studies (Visscher et al., 2012) and analyses of archaic introgres-
sion (Vattathil and Akey, 2015) are enriched in particular
brain regions in the adult or developing brain. These expression
patterns might provide insights into the processes in which these
genes act, and this information can then be used to guide further
functional experiments in cell lines, organoids or model
organisms.

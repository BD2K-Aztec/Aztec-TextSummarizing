ABSTRACT

Summary: MoDPeplnt (Modular Domain Peptide Interaction) is a
new easy-to—use web server for the prediction of binding partners
for modular protein domains. Currently, we offer models for SH2,
SH3 and PDZ domains via the tools SH2PepInt, SH3Peplnt and
PDZPeplnt, respectively. More specifically, our server offers predic-
tions for 51 SH2 human domains and 69 SH3 human domains via
single domain models, and predictions for 226 PDZ domains across
several species, via 43 multidomain models. All models are based on
support vector machines with different kernel functions ranging from
polynomial, to Gaussian, to advanced graph kernels. In this way, we
model non-linear interactions between amino acid residues. Results
were validated on manually curated datasets achieving competitive
performance against various state-of-the—art approaches.
Availability and implementation: The MoDPeplnt server is available
under the URL http://modpepint.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions are often mediated by modular pro-
tein domains in eukaryotes and play an essential role in diverse
biological processes such as signal transduction, cellular growth
and cell polarity 03awson and Nash, 2003). Modular domains
that speciﬁcally bind with short linear peptides are known as
peptide recognition modules. Each domain family recognizes
peptides with speciﬁc characteristics. For example, phosphotyr-
osine (pY)-containing peptides, proline-rich peptides and
C-terminus peptides are recognized by SH2, SH3 and PDZ do-
mains, respectively. However, individual domains from the same
family show different binding speciﬁcity. Accurate models that
can help understand the mechanisms responsible for the highly
selective binding afﬁnity are therefore of interest. Recently, seV-
eral high-throughput techniques, such as protein microarray,
phage display and SPOT synthesis, have been developed,
which can detect the binding speciﬁcity of various modular
domains. However, efﬁcient bioinformatics tools are needed to

extract meaningful knowledge from the enormous amount of
data produced.

To this end, we used state-of-the-art machine learning
approaches to build support vector machine models that can
accurately predict binding speciﬁcity. We have collected into a
uniﬁed web-based system called MoDPeplnt (Modular Domain
Peptide Interaction), three different tools: SH2PepInt,
SH3Peplnt and PDZPepInt for three different modular domains,
namely, SH2, SH3 and PDZ (Kundu et al., 2013a,b; Kundu and
Backofen, 2014). Currently, we offer single domain models for 51
SH2 human and 69 SH3 human domains, and multidomain
models for 226 PDZ domains across human, mouse, ﬂy and
worm. To assess the quality of our models, we have used manu-
ally curated interaction data achieving competitive performance
against various state-of-the-art approaches.

In summary, MoDPeplnt unique features include (i) a
domain-peptide prediction system for SH2, SH3 and PDZ in a
single platform and (ii) the largest number of modeled domains
(see Supplementary Table S1).

2 APPLICATION AND FUNCTIONALITY
2.1 Input

All tools have a uniﬁed input format. Query sequences (up to a maximum
number of 500) can be supplied either in a FASTA format or using
UniProt database accession numbers. PDZPepInt offers predictions
also for domains that are newly developed and/or not comprised in the
original 226 PDZ domains: the unknown query domain should be sup-
plied in FASTA format. Multiple query domain sequences can also be
provided.

2.2 Filters

Several ﬁlters are available to increase predictive accuracy. SH2 domains
generally recognize phosphotyrosine (pY) residues of binding proteins.
For this reason, in SH2PepInt, we offer a phosphotyrosine ﬁlter that only
considers those peptides whose tyrosine phosphorylation has already
been experimentally veriﬁed and reported in PhosphoSitePlus database
(Hornbeck et al., 2012).

As SH3 domains mainly bind with proline-rich peptides, in
SH3PepInt, we offer a proline-rich ﬁlter that uses 31 regular expressions
to select proline-rich peptides (Carducci et al., 2012).

PDZ domains have the tendency to bind the unstructured C-terminal
regions of binding proteins; hence, in PDZPepInt, we offer a ﬁlter to
select for intrinsically unstructured/disordered regions based on the
IUPred algorithm mosztanyi et al., 2005), which selects ﬁve C-terminal
residues with IUPred scores >0.4 (Akiva et al., 2012).

Finally, a cellular localization ﬁlter is available for all tools. This ﬁlter
considers only those interactions where both the protein containing
the peptide and the protein containing the modular domain have the
same cellular localization according to the Gene Ontology Database
(Ashburner et al., 2000).

2.3 Processing and output

An internal queuing system (which currently uses 40 computation nodes)
balances the submitted jobs in parallel. MoDPepInt is implemented in
C+ + , perl and shell scripting, with runtimes typically ranging in the
order of few minutes.

The output for all three tools is formatted as a downloadable table. We
report for each domain—ligand protein interaction pair (i) the sequence
ID, (ii) the ligand binding position, (iii) the ligand binding sequence and
(iv) the ligand binding domains. See Figure 1 for the schematic represen-
tation of the MoDPepInt pipeline.

3 DISCUSSION

MoDPepInt collects three protein—protein interaction predictive
models that can be efﬁciently tuned using data derived from
various high-throughput experimental techniques and thus do
not require structural information as in Brannetti et al., 2000
and Hou et al., 2008, 2012. The resulting models exhibit signiﬁ-
cant performance improvement in comparison with other exist-
ing tools. The main sources of performance improvement are due
to the following: (i) non-linear modeling and advantage over
linear PWM models (Obenauer et al., 2003), (ii) balanced dis-
criminative training and (iii) datasets pooling.

SH2PepInt uses polynomial kernels, and it is trained on add-
itional high-conﬁdence negatives obtained Via semisupervised
techniques.

SH3Peplnt uses graph kernels on a complex representation of
both the peptide sequence and the aligned domains. The adop-
tion of a graph-type representation allows the inclusion of the
physico-chemical properties of amino acids, which increases the
generalization capacity of the models. Furthermore, the method
does not need any prior alignment of the peptides. This is a big
advantage because poly-proline-rich peptides are hard to align.

PDZPepInt uses Gaussian kernels, and it is trained on inter-
action data from additional highly related domains. Using pool-
ing from closely related domains allows to leverage the limited
information available for some domains and to extrapolate to
unseen, but alignable, novel domains.

 

Once trained, all models can be used to efﬁciently scan entire
proteomes to identify novel interactions with typical runtimes of
few minutes.

In addition, we offer a meta-web server to be used in non-
expert mode that submits the input simultaneously to all tools
and displays a summary of the main results. For performance
comparisons, details on the novelty of the methods and descrip-
tion of the meta-web server, see Supplementary Information.

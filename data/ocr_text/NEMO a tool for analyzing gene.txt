ABSTRACT

Summary: Three-dimensional fluorescence in situ hybridization
(3D-FISH) is used to study the organization and the positioning
of chromosomes or specific sequences such as genes or RNA
in cell nuclei. Many different programs (commercial or free)
allow image analysis for 3D-FISH experiments. One of the
more efficient open-source programs for automatically processing
3D-FISH microscopy images is Smart 3D-FISH, an ImageJ plug-in
designed to automatically analyze distances between genes. One
of the drawbacks of Smart 3D-FISH is that it has a rather basic
user interface and produces its results in various text and image
files thus making the data post-processing step time consuming. We
developed a new Smart 3D-FISH graphical user interface, NEMO,
which provides all information in the same place so that results can
be checked and validated efficiently. NEMO gives users the ability to
drive their experiments analysis in either automatic, semi-automatic
or manual detection mode. We also tuned Smart 3D-FISH to better
analyze chromosome territories.

Availability: NEMO is a stand-alone Java application available for
Windows and Linux platforms. The program is distributed under
the creative commons licence and can be freely downloaded from

1 INTRODUCTION

Now that genome sequencing has been mastered and cell imaging
techniques have vastly improved our understanding of cell structure
and function, there is an increasing demand in life science studies for
cell imaging techniques and for ways to provide accurate localization
of genes and their products within cells and tissues. Three—
dimensional ﬂuorescence in situ hybridization, 3D—FISH (Solovei
et al., 2002), is used to study the organization and positioning of
chromosomes, sub—chromosomal regions and/or speciﬁc sequences
such as genes or RNA in cellular preparations with the 3D
structure of the chromatin preserved by hybridization of probes with
complementary sequences. Many different programs allow image
analysis for 3D—FISH experiments (commercial or free) and one

of the most efﬁcient programs for processing 3D—FISH confocal
microscopy images is Smart 3D—FISH (Gue et al., 2005), an Image]
[Rasband (1997—2009)] plug—in designed to automatically analyze
distances between gene spots. This Image] plug—in provides a
powerful automatic processing mode able to detect and measure
object distances in multiple—channel experiments. After processing,
Smart 3D—FISH uses predeﬁned parameters (for objects and images)
to auto—estimate segmentation quality. Results are then manually
checked using the various text and image ﬁles produced. The fact
that data were spread across various text and image ﬁles made
the post—processing step time consuming. We decided to develop
new software, NEMO, a Smart 3D—FISH graphical user interface
providing all data in one place to improve result investigation;
NEMO gives users the ability to drive their experiments analysis
either in automatic, semi—automatic or manual detection mode. Cells
annotations and processing results are stored in the NEMO relational
database (MySQL) helping users to better manage and extract data
for post—processing analysis. We also tuned Smart 3D—FISH to better
detect chromosome territories (CTs).

2 PROGRAM FEATURES

Features can be divided according to the analysis process steps: ﬁelds
images import, cells outlining, parameters setup, cells processing
and results validation.

2.1 Field image import

The user creates a new ﬁeld by providing a name, a directory path,
the number of channels (one to seven), their names and colours. The
8—bit or 16—bit gray level TIFF image stacks can be imported for
each channel (additional image formats will be supported in future
release). NEMO can process epiﬂuorescence (deconvolved or not)
and confocal stacks knowing that results pertinence always depends
on raw image quality

2.2 Cell outlines

A ﬁeld contains several cells; a user can deﬁne each cell by drawing
a region of interest (ROI) onto the ﬁeld image. This R01 is used
to produce a sub—image representing only that cell for further
processing. NEMO also provides a function that detects cells in
ﬁelds automatically by taking into account circularity and minimum
area parameters for individual nuclei, based on automatic isodata
thresholding on the whole nucleus projection image.

2.3 Parameters setup for object detection

The parameters to be entered are of two types: processing
parameters and segmentation quality estimation parameters.
Processing parameters deﬁne ﬁlters to run on raw images
(Median 3D, TopHat 3D, mathematical morphology 3D) and xyz
resolutions. Segmentation quality estimation parameters are used
after processing to highlight unreliable results: minimal image
signal—to—noise ratio, maximum object number, minimum and
maximum object volumes.

2.4 Cell processing

Cell processing is a two step workﬂow: objects are ﬁrst detected
from cells and then various distances are measured between objects.
Objects are detected by computing seeds as brightest maximum
local pixels above a global threshold, and a local threshold is then
computed to aggregate neighboring pixels to the seed. Depending
on objects type, spots, CTs or nuclei, the global thresholds are
computed differently. After processing, users can visually inspect
image segmentation and distance values using the NEMO interface.
The distances computed are euclidean distances taking into account
the xy and z resolutions. NEMO can compute center to center
distances, center to border or border to border distances between
objects (spots, CTs or nuclei). Border distances are computed
based on the detection of the border pixels of the objects after
segmentation. Unlike Smart 3D—FISH, the user can mask image
artifacts or adjust the segmentation threshold to improve object
detection. Objects can be added by manually pointing a pixel to
use as seed or by drawing it as a ROI directly on the image stack.

2.5 Result validation

After cell processing, the user chooses a validation status (OK,
Unreliable or Rejected) and writes a comment for the cell.
Results are composed of object characteristics (coordinates, volume,
area, compacity, radial and Feret Distance) and various distances
concerning pairs of objects (distances, angle and co—localization
percentage). Results are stored in ﬁles at the time of validation.
Users can use NEMO with or without a MySQL database, if the
database is indicated in the preferences; in this case, results are also
stored in the database.

3 USER INTERFACE

The NEMO interface is made up of a four—level hierarchical tree view
representing ﬁeld cells and objects in different channels (Fig. 1).
The user can explore the results by browsing this tree view. Various
measurements (depending on the item currently selected in the tree
view) are displayed at the bottom of the window. Cell images (raw
and segmented) can be displayed by double—clicking the cell item
in the tree view. When a cell is displayed, detected objects can
be localized in the images by clicking on them in the tree view
(objects are highlighted red in the segmented image view). A Y —axis
projection view of raw images and an interactive 3D reconstruction
view can be displayed in separate windows. User actions are logged

at the bottom of the screen. The NEMO MySQL database can be
queried using a dedicated interface; the user can query cells, objects
or distance data using criteria (name, status, comments, etc.). NEMO
can be used in command—line interface so ﬁelds can be processed
automatically in batch mode.

4 CONCLUSION

Reliable and fast measurements of the relative positioning of genes
toward their chromosomal territories are essential to analyze the
role of nuclear architecture on the regulation of gene expression in
three dimensions. NEMO is a user—friendly interface to interactively
analyze and visualize FISH 3D images. NEMO automatically
detects objects in the images (spots, CTs or nuclei) nevertheless
the user has the possibility to interact with the program to delete
or add objects. The results are then stored in a relational database
(MySQL) for further analyses.

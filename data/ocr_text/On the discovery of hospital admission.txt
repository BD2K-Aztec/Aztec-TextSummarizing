This article concerns my publication ‘Discovering hospital admis-
sion patterns using models learnt from electronic hospital records’,
which has recently appeared in Bioinformatics (Arandjelovic,
2015a) and the comments regarding its contributions made there-
after by Lopez-Campos et al. (2016).

Lopez-Campos et al. (2016) begin by observing a mismatch be-
tween the descriptions of certain ICD codes as stated in my article
(Arandjelovic, 2015a) and those published by the World Health
Organization. This observation is correct and, needless to say, while
I greatly regret the error, I am genuinely grateful for having this
brought to my attention so that a timely erratum can be published.

It is important to stress that the mismatch in question in no way
affects the main content of the article, its contribution, or any of the
results: the method described in the original publication does not
use any semantic information about the codes and their meanings
are stated merely for the sake of illustration and context. The unfor-
tunate error in the description of the codes is likely to have taken
place in the editing stages of the original article when the presenta-
tion and the content of the relevant table and the related informa-
tion in the text underwent changes several times.

More pertinent to the actual methodological contribution of my
work are the opinions of Lopez-Campos et al. (2016) on the manner
in which the aforesaid codes are used and in particular what Lopez-
Campos et al. (2016) refer to as the intended use and the spirit of
the codes. There are several arguments which speak against this
stance. First, on the fundamental philosophical level, the intention
behind the design per se is inherently inconsequential. Rather the
relevant question is whether the codes, such as they are, contain the
structure and information which permit prediction. The results I
present which show that the proposed method achieves far better
prediction than more primitive models—adapted to the present
problem from the work of others as described in Arandjelovic’:
(2015a,b)—demonstrate this conclusively (Arandjelovic, 2015a;
Vasiljeva and Arandjelovié, 2016). This is also far from an isolated

piece of evidence. For example in ‘A Special Survey of Deaths’ (RGI-
CGHR Collaborators, 2009), a major large-scale and long-term
health care initiative in India, the same manner of coarse coding as
described in my work is used too. In short, the concern expressed by
Lopez-Campos et al. (2016) is neither warranted by theoretical prin-
ciples nor empirical evidence.

Last, I certainly appreciate the viewpoint of Lopez-Campos et al.
(2016) in desiring more detailed information on the data set used.
Equally, I trust that they will appreciate the alternative argument
which comes from the need for a compromise imposed by the rather
restrictive page limit of Bioinformatics of only seven pages.
Considering that the contribution of my work does not pertain to
any specific medical findings as such but rather to an algorithm
(which when deployed may and indeed should lead to findings of
the aforementioned nature) I considered it reasonable to place a
greater emphasis on the description of the methodological aspects of
the work, wherein the key novelty lies.

Conﬂict of Interest: none declared.

Abstract

Motivation: Phenomics is the study of the properties and behaviors of organisms (i.e. their pheno—
types) on a high—throughput scale. New computational tools are needed to analyze complex
phenomics data, which consists of multiple traits/behaviors that interact with each other and are
dependent on external factors, such as genotype and environmental conditions, in a way that has
not been well studied.

Results: We deployed an efficient framework for partitioning complex and high dimensional pheno—
type data into distinct functional groups. To achieve this, we represented measured phenotype data
from each genotype as a cloud—of—points, and developed a novel non—parametric clustering algorithm
to cluster all the genotypes. When compared with conventional clustering approaches, the new
method is advantageous in that it makes no assumption about the parametric form of the underlying
data distribution and is thus particularly suitable for phenotype data analysis. We demonstrated the
utility of the new clustering technique by distinguishing novel phenotypic patterns in both synthetic
data and a high—throughput plant photosynthetic phenotype dataset. We biologically verified the
clustering results using four Arabidopsis chloroplast mutant lines.

The plummeting cost of genome sequencing has ushered genomics
into a new era. However, using genomics data alone is insufficient
to answer most major questions in biology, because genomics data
cannot explain how genes control complex behaviors (Cobb et 61].,
2013; Shendure and Ji, 2008; Wagner and Zhang 2013). The next
wave in biology will be to phenotype organisms and then integrate
genomes with phenomes to identify genes that may govern pheno—
type and responses to the varying environment (Butte and Kohane,
2006). Especially, progress in phenotyping technologies is required

association studies for dissecting the genetic architecture of import—
ant traits underlying phenotypes (Yang et 61]., 2014).

It thus is important to develop computational methods to exam—
ine potentially interacting phenotypes (i.e. measurable traits/behav—
iors) of a genetically diverse population for a given species in order
to identify meaningful differences in biological function. The data—
base PhenomicDB has been built to collect phenotypes of multiple
species in free—text format with the goal to gain insights into the gen-
etic origin of diseases (Groth et 61]., 2007). Phenoclustering was then

proposed to perform meta—analysis on PhenomicDB using advanced
natural language processing methods, resulting in clusters of genes
by the similarity of their phenotypes that can be further explored for
genotype—phenotype interaction analysis (Groth et al., 2010, 2011).
However, since high—throughput phenotyping quantitatively assesses
multiple phenotypes of many traits simultaneously, it often gener—
ates a large amount of data rather than qualitative descriptions.
New approaches to analyze quantitative phenomics data are needed.
One application is in bioenergy research, where computational tech—
niques have been developed to detect, collect and study photosyn—
thesis and related traits, such as growth, under non—laboratory
conditions and in high throughput (Cruz et al., 2015; Tessmer et al.,
2013; Xu et al., 2015).

In general, photosynthesis phenotypes can be altered in two
ways, either through the changes of peripheral processes of the
photosynthesis regulatory network or the modification of central
components of the network (Diner and Rappaport, 2002). Changes
in peripheral processes tend to preserve regulatory relationships
within the network. In contrast, altering the central components of
photosynthesis is likely to perturb the relationships between key
regulatory processes, leading to a different correlation among photo—
synthesis phenotypes. In this study, we focus on data analysis for the
second case, to which we refer as inter-functional analysis for photo—
synthesis phenotypes data.

By taking advantage of the systematic knockout of genes encod—
ing chloroplast—targeted proteins in Arabidopsis thalicma, a model
plant, we have conducted a large—scale phenotype screen on the sin—
gle knockouts and the references to understand the underlying mo—
lecular functions of the knockout genes in plant photosynthesis
(Cruz et al., 2015; Lu et al., 2011). In our experiment, plants with
single gene knockouts have been profiled by non—invasively measur—
ing three key photosynthetic parameters, i.e. ¢II, 6113 and 611 (that re—
ﬂect photosynthesis efficiency in photosystem II, active energy
dissipation, and photoinhibition, respectively), in response to fluctu—
ating light conditions, resulting in a large volume of plant phenotyp—
ing data that allow us to determine the downstream effects of the
knockout genes on photosynthesis in dynamic conditions (Kramer
and Evans, 2011). More specifically, multiple ﬂuorescence images
(Fig. 1a) are taken for every plant as the light intensity is varied over
time and the photosynthesis parameters (Fig. 1b) are derived from
each image. As a result, each plant is characterized by a sequence of
three—dimensional vectors with each dimension corresponding to a

different photosynthesis parameter. The objective of this study is to
automatically identify gene groups with their photosynthesis pheno—
types significantly different from reference based on the collected
data.

A natural first step is to examine the extremes, i.e. mutant lines
that exhibit significantly different photosynthesis characters from
the wild type in all of the three photosynthesis parameters. Although
this simple technique has been shown to be effective for identifying
potential biomarkers and drug targets, it is not an effective approach
for exploiting the full potential of experimental results (Eisen et al.,
1998). In this work, we take a holistic approach for inter—functional
photosynthesis data analysis. We develop an efficient workﬂow to
effectively identify novel phenotypes based on mutant lines sharing
similar measurements of photosynthesis parameters. The identified
gene groups and their associated phenotypes are used to derive in—
sight into the functions of and interactions between related genes.
Based on existing annotations and literature for the well—studied
genes, we can associate biological processes with each phenotype
pattern, which in turn can be used to reveal the functions for the
poorly characterized genes (Jaqaman et al., 2007).

Although numerous clustering algorithms have been developed,
most of them require vector representation of data and thus cannot
be applied directly to our problem where each plant is represented
by a sequence of vectors (Bar—Joseph, 2004; McNicholas and
Murphy, 2010; Nascimento et al., 2012; Qian et al., 2001; Schliep
et al., 2003). One simple way to handle the challenge is to run stand—
ard clustering algorithms (e.g. k—means and hierarchical clustering)
against all the vectors measured for different plants, and determine
the cluster member for each plant by taking the major vote among
the measured vectors. Another approach is to concatenate the se—
quence of vectors measured for each plant into a single vector, and
apply standard clustering algorithms to the derived vectors. The
main problem with these two approaches is that they are unable to
effectively explore the correlation among different photosynthesis
parameters revealed by the set of vectors measured for each plant.
This is particularly important for photosynthesis data analysis be—
cause it is the correlation between photosynthesis parameters that
helps understand the regulatory role of the mutated genes on the
photosynthesis processes.

We propose to address the above challenges of phenotype
data analysis by developing a novel clustering technique named
Non-parametric modeling, or NPM for short. We introduce a

cloud—of—points representation for each mutant line, with each point
corresponding to a vector in the sequential phenotype measurements
taken for the mutant line, where the correlation among photosyn—
thesis parameters is captured by the ‘shapes’ of clouds. Based on the
theory of kernel density estimation (KDE), we then apply a non-
parametric clustering technique to group plants into the same cluster
if their clouds share similar shapes (Cybakov, 2009).

When compared with the existing clustering algorithms, the
key advantage of NPM is that it does not make any assumption
about the underlying data distribution and thus is particularly
suitable for phenotype data analysis. Our empirical study shows
promising results of the proposed clustering technique on both
synthetic and real photosynthesis datasets. We have biologically
verified the clustering results using four Arabidopsis mutant lines
for nuclear encoded chloroplast proteins. The experimental results
demonstrate that NPM is able to generate testable hypotheses,
which lead to new biological discoveries. We emphasize that
although our empirical study is limited to photosynthesis data, the
non—parametric clustering algorithm developed in this work is gen—
eral and can be applied to other domains (e.g. gene expression
data analysis).

2 Related work

Clustering algorithms have been widely used in biological data ana—
lysis. One well known example is gene expression clustering (Eisen
et al., 1998; Herwig, 1999; Tamayo et al., 1999). Numerous cluster—
ing algorithms have been designed to exploit temporal correlations
and trends in gene expression time series (Bar—Joseph 2004; Bar-
Joseph et al., 2003; Costa et al., 2004; Qian et al., 2001;
McNicholas and Murphy, 2010; Nascimento et al., 2012; Ramoni
et al., 2002; Schliep et al., 2003; Sivriver et al., 2011). Clustering al—
gorithms have also been successfully applied to biological network
analysis, which aims to discover and identify gene functional groups
(Cingovska et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2002), and to
sequence analysis [e.g. sequence alignment (Corpet, 1988), motif
detection (Lones and Tyrrell, 2007) and protein/DNA sequence clus—
tering (Enright and Ouzounis, 2000; Li and Godzik, 2006)]. Most
previous studies of clustering algorithms in biological data analysis
are based on parametric models (Bakar and Watada, 2008; Ben—Dor
et al., 1999). In contrast, the proposed method adopts non—
parametric density estimation for data clustering that does not make
parametric assumptions about the underlying distribution.

A well-known non-parametric clustering method is mean—shift
(Carreira-Perpiﬁan, 2006; Comaniciu, 2002), which is widely used
in computer vision and image processing. Other examples of non—
parametric clustering are the scale—space method (Roberts, 1997;
Wilson and Spann, 1990) and spectral clustering (Von Luxburg,
2007). The scale—space clustering method was pioneered in Wilson
and Spann (1990), and further studied in Roberts (1997) using dens—
ity estimation. Spectral clustering is mostly based on the theory of
manifold learning (Ma and Fu, 2012), and has been widely used for
image segmentation. However, since most non—parametric clustering
algorithms require vector representation of data, they cannot be
applied directly to our problem.

The theoretical foundation of the proposed work is based on
KDE (Parzen, 1962; Rosenblatt, 1956). KDE was first introduced
in the 1950s (Rosenblatt, 1956). The consistency of KDE was
shown initially in Parzen (1962) and its convergence rate for finite
samples was later proved (Nadaraya, 1965; Stute, 1982). A more
complete literature review for KDE can be found in Cybakov
(2009)

3 Non-parametric clustering for phenotypic data
analysis

In this work, we develop a novel clustering algorithm NPM for in-
ter—functional phenotype data analysis. Below, we will present
phenotype data representation and framework of non-parametric
clustering, and then describe an efficient algorithm for solving the
related optimization problem.

3.1 Data representation

The center of NPM is a cloud—of—points representation. Let
M1, . . . ,Mm be a collection of in genotypes. Let p be the number of
photosynthesis parameters. For each genotype Mi, we denote by

i i
X1,...,X

m the sequence of multi—dimensional vectors measured for

M), where n,- is the number of valid measurements for M,- and each
 E RP includes the measurements of p photosynthesis parameters
derived from the jth measurement for M).

Because the focus of this study is to examine the dependence
among different photosynthesis parameters, we will ignore the se—

quential order among vectors  1 and simply characterize the

m
photosynthesis property of genotype— M, by the set of data points
D,- :  . . . , xiii}, which we refer to as cloud-of—points representa-
tion. Figure 1c shows examples of the cloud—of—points representation
for the sequence of ¢II, 6113 and 611 measurements that are given in

Figure lb.

3.2 A framework for non—parametric clustering

Following the standard framework of mixture models (McLachlan
and Peel, 2004), we assume that there are K different underlying dis-
tributions, where each distribution is introduced to capture a differ—
ent ‘shape’ of the cloud—of—points representation, and all the data
points observed in the cloud—of—points representation are drawn in-
dependently from one of the K distributions.

More specifically, let f1(-), . . . ,  be the density functions for
the K underlying distributions, and let P : (P1, . . . , PK) be the prior
probabilities for choosing each distribution. Then, for mutant line
M), the likelihood of observing the cloud—of—points representation
D,- : 1 is then given by

K K "i .
Prom = ZPiPr(Dilf/') = ZPinl-(xb- <1)
i=1 i=1 k=1

Following the framework of maximum likelihood estimation
(Scholz, 1985), we find the optimal density functions  by
solving the optimization problem

m

max 2 logPr(D,-) (2)
1,...,fK,P 

where Pr(D,-) is given in Equation (1).

The main challenge arises from solving the optimization problem
in Equation (2), in which the variables to be optimized are functions
(or vectors of infinite dimension). This is in contrast to most opti—
mization problems where the variables are of finite dimension
(Fletcher, 2013). The type of optimization problem in Equation (2)
is often referred to as variational optimization in the literature of op—
erations research. One simple approach towards variational opti—
mization is to make specific assumptions about the density functions
 a common approach adopted in the study of mixture mod—
els (McLachlan and Peel, 2004). In the simple approach, a paramet—
ric family of distributions, e.g. the well—known Gaussian mixture
model, is specified assuming that each  is a Gaussian

distribution. However, this simple approach could be problematic in
our study, since the complicated shaped cloud—of—points representa—
tion (see Fig. 4) may not fit well to any member in the specified dis—
tribution family. Therefore, we adopt the non—parametric density
estimation approach, because the key advantage of non—parametric
approach is that it avoids the parametric assumption of the underly—
ing distribution (Cybakov, 2009).

3.3 Efficient computational algorithm

We propose to solve the optimization problem in Equation (2) by
exploring the theory of KDE. Our approach is based on the
Nadaraya—Watson method for density estimation (Cybakov, 2009).
More specifically, let x1, . . . ,2) be the E landmark points, where
landmark points are randomly sampled from the collection of data
points for all mutant lines. Using the landmark points, we approxi—
mate each density function  as:

1
291x): ; >< 22:10:?ch — ﬁg) (3)

where or; : (ail-1, . . . , or?) are parameters to be determined for f],  :
(TE/’12)_p / 2exp(—|X|2 / 192) is a multi—variate Gaussian distribution and la
is the kernel bandwidth. Since  is a density function, we have 0676-120,
q E [1,E] and 22:1 or? :  1 = 1, where 1 is a vector of all ones.
Using the approximation in (3), the likelihood function Pr(D,-) is

rewritten as:

"i

K 1 E '
i=1 k=1 q=1

We can approximate the variational optimization problem in
Equation (2) into the following normal optimization problem:

max £({oci}f:1,P) : ZlogPr(D,—) (5)
0:1,...,orK,P 1.21
where «1, . . . ,ocK E {ocj E R5: : 0ch : 1} and Pr(D,-) is given in (4).
We developed an EM algorithm to efficiently optimize the ob-
jective function in Equation (5). For each mutant line Mi, we intro-
duce a hidden variable Z,- E  to indicate which cluster (or density
function) M,- belongs to. In the E—step, we estimate the posterior
probability Pr(Z,- : j|D,-) as:

7L" f
Pi(z,- 2,119,) oc 12,1] (2 afiax; — 5%)) (6)
[2:1 q=1

In the M—step, we update the prior probabilities P and parameters

where 561, . . . , 01K are parameters obtained in the previous iteration

of EM algorithm.

Algorithm 1 highlights the key steps of our EM algorithm. In
line 2—5, data are first normalized to prevent large measurement
dominating others. In line 7, the landmark points are sampled.
Then, the EM iteration part is in line 9—17. E— and M—step are re—
peated until the log—likelihood converges. The output are K density

known that an EM algorithm could be trapped in a bad local opti—
mum, we run Algorithm 1 multiple times and choose the solution
with the largest log—likelihood.

One fundamental assumption of NPM is that density function
 can be approximated by Equation (3). Theoretic study of KDE
can easily show that any smooth bounded density function can be
well approximated by Equation (3) provided that the number of
sampled landmark data points E is sufficiently large. Please refer to
Theorem S1 in Supplementary Material. We finally note that the
density functions for most well—known distributions (e.g. Gaussian

and Laplacian distributions) are smooth and bounded, and thus
assuming density functions to be smooth and bounded is a very
minor assumption in real—world applications.

4 Experiments

For performance evaluation, we compared NPM with a series of base—
lines that adopt two different data representation methods other than
the cloud—of—point representation used in NPM. The first method is to
use concatenated vectors, i.e. concatenating the set of data vectors
measured for each genotype into a single vector, and then applying to
the derived vectors three standard clustering algorithms: (i) le—means
(MacQueen, 1967) (Kmeans), (ii) hierarchical clustering (Johnson,
1967) (Hierarchy) and (iii) using principal component analysis
(Jolliffe, 1986) to reduce the dimensionality of the concatenated vec—
tors and then applying le—means (PCA —l— Kmeans), where the reduced
dimensionality was set to 3 in our experiments. The second data rep—
resentation method is to simply use the original vectors: clustering all
the vectors measured for different genotypes, and then determining
the cluster membership for each genotype by taking the majority vote
among the vectors measured for that genotype. Two baseline algo—
rithms were developed based on this method: (i) applying le—means to
all the measured vectors (Kmeans—split) and (ii) applying Gaussian
mixture model to all the measured vectors (GMM—split).

Except for the number of clusters K, there are three parameters
to be specified in NPM: the stopping criterion 6 for EM process, the
kernel bandwidth Io for KDE and the number of landmark points E.
Within a cross—validation dataset (see Section 4.2 for details), a grid
search was applied to find the best kernel bandwidth lo that resulted
in the maximal log-likelihood. A similar approach is applied to de—
termine the number of landmark points E. For parameter 6, we sim—
ply set 6 = 1 in our experiment.

4.1 Plant photosynthesis phenotyping experiment
Photosynthesis involves the net movement of electrons generated
from the oxidation of water through a series of electron carriers to a
chemical reductant NADPH (LEF, linear electron flux). These reac—
tions are driven by light energy that is funneled to two chlorophyll
containing complexes, Photosystem II (PSII) which extracts electrons
from water and Photosystem I (PSI) which donates electrons to the
terminal acceptor Ferredoxin and ultimately NADP—l—to form
NADPH. Electron transfer between PSII and PSI is essentially con—
nected by the cytochrome b6f complex (cyt b6 f) and mobile electron
carriers, plastoquinone/plastoquinol (PQ/PQHZ) and plastocyanin.
LEF is tightly coupled to the formation of an electrochemical proton
gradient (pmf, proton motive force) between the lumen (inner thyla-
koid compartment) and the stroma. First, the oxidation of water by
PSII releases protons into the lumen. Second, during the sequential
reduction of PO to PQH2 in the stroma—localized quinone binding
sites of PSII and b6f, protons are taken from the stroma and are
released into the lumen upon oxidation of PQH2 to PO at the
lumen-localized quinol binding site on cyt b6f. me has an electric
field component (A10) and a chemical gradient component (ApH),
which are thermodynamically equivalent but kinetically separable.
Its dissipation through the chloroplast ATP synthase is coupled to
the phosphorylation of ADP to form ATP. The amplitude of pmf de—
pends on the rate of proton accumulation and on the resistance (in—
verse of the proton conductivity, gH+) of the chloroplast ATP
synthase to proton ﬂux. Both NADPH (reducing power) and ATP
(chemical bond energy) are used by downstream metabolism, pri—
marily the fixation of carbon dioxide into sugars.

The formation of high energy states and reactive intermediates
during photosynthesis can lead to damage to the photosystems (pho—
toinhibition) and/or formation of reactive oxygen species. Indeed,
photoinhibited PSII centers accumulate in a light intensity dependent
manner and have been linked to the long—lived component of non—
photochemical quenching (611). However, LEF is self—regulating; as
excitation pressure increases, electron transfer slows (in effect
photosynthetic efficiency, dm, decreases) and excess is energy ac—
tively dissipated (quenching increases) to minimize the accumulation
of reduced intermediates. More specifically, the ApH component of
pmf (acidification of the lumen) slows the oxidation of PQH2 at cyt
b6 f and at the same time induces two pH sensitive components of 6113
quenching. Under stress, inhibition of LEF may limit the formation
of pmf. For example, under severe C02 limitation, as the acceptor
pool (NADP—l—) diminishes in the absence of carbon fixation, LEF
will slow to a rate that cannot support a significant ApH. In such
cases, a higher ApH can be sustained by: (i) alternative pathways
that supplement proton uptake such as cyclic electron flux, (ii)
increasing the fraction of pmf stored as ApH, and/or 3) decreasing
proton conductivity through the ATP synthase, gH+ [as reviewed in
Baker (2008); Kramer et al. (2004)].

In our experiment, we screened a total of 338 chloroplast—targeted
single mutant lines in A. thaliana. To ensure the reliability of the re—
sults, multiple biological replicates (four or more) were examined for
each mutant line, so the total number of plants added up to 1, 499,
which is also the number of instances used in follow—up analysis. A
sample of the phenotype dataset is available at Supplementary
Table 81. For each plant, three photosynthesis parameters (dm, 6113 and
611) were measured (P = 3 for our algorithm). The photosynthetic par—
ameter, @H (quantum yield of photochemistry), when multiplied by
the ambient light intensity (light) yields a quantity proportional to the
LEF rate. The quenching parameters, qE (rapidly relaxing in the dark,
Apia dependent) and 611 (slowing relaxing, related to photoinhibition),
are two separate photoprotective mechanisms that dissipate excess
light energy (Cruz et al., 2015).

4.2 Clustering results using NPM
Given the photosynthesis phenotype data, we adopted the cross—
validation method suggested in Smyth (2000) to decide the number
of clusters K. We used 3—fold cross—validation, i.e. at each time,
NPM was fit on two thirds of the data (as training set), and the like—
lihood of the fitted model on the remaining one third data (as test
set) was computed. Higher log—likelihood means that the model is
better fitted to data. Figure 3 shows that when K is larger or equal
to 3, the cross—validation likelihood is near its maximum value.
Therefore, we set K to be 3.

Subsequently, three clusters of plants were identified by NPM.
For the convenience of visualization, we plotted the clustering re—
sults in 2D spaces, with coordinates corresponding to two

Fig. 4. Three clusters of Arabidopsis chloroplast mutant lines identified by NPM
on the plant photosynthesis phenotype data. The data points are plotted in 2D
spaces: (a) qE — ((p” x light) space, (b) q — (th >< light) space, (c) ql — qE space

parameters each time (see Fig. 4). To better understand the overall
properties of each cluster, we focus on the qE versus (p11 >< light) plot
in Figure 4a. For all plants, changes in 6113 and (dm >< light) are posi—
tively correlated with the changes in light intensity. The clustering
results of the sampled phenotype dataset are available at
Supplementary Table S2.

The first cluster (green) in this plot contains 87% of plants, includ—
ing all the wild type plants. We refer to it as the cluster of wt—lilee.
When compared with the other two clusters, the wt—lilee cluster ex—
hibits a stronger correlation between 6113 and (p11 >< light), which re—
ﬂects the sigmoidal relationship between the ApH component of pmf
generated by photosynthetic electron ﬂux and lumen pH—dependent
processes required for 6113 quenching, i.e. violaxanthin deepoxidase ac—
tivation and PsbS protonation (Takizawa et al., 2007).

When compared with the first cluster, the mutant lines in the se—
cond cluster (red) tend to have significantly higher qE sensitivity to
electron ﬂux, suggesting that in these mutant lines pmf builds to a
larger extent due to more restricted proton ﬂux through the ATP
synthase lower gH+) or that the fraction of pmf stored as ApH is
larger. We refer to it as the cluster of qE-sensitiz/e. On the other
hand, mutant lines in the third cluster (blue) show normal
(dm >< light) values but significantly lower 6113 values than the wt—lilee
cluster, indicating that these mutant lines may lack the capacity to
accumulate a significant ApH or other biochemical components es—
sential for 6113. We refer to it as the cluster of low-61E. Similar pheno—
type partition can be found in the 611— (p11 >< light) space (Fig. 4b)
and q1 — qE space (Fig. 4c).

4.3 Performance evaluation

Because a significant portion of the chloroplast—targeted proteins
have unknown functions, the optimal gene grouping is unknown,
making it difficult to directly measure the clustering performance of
NPM (Lamesch et al., 2012). To perform objective evaluation of the
clustering results, we computed the gene—to—gene similarities based
on the clustering result, denoted as photosynthesis phenotype-based
similarity (PPS). In parallel, we derived another kind of gene—to—gene
similarity score based on the biological knowledge from metabolic
pathways or existing gene expression data, denoted as extra

Fig. 5 Evaluation results of different clustering algorithms for the photosyn-
thesis data based on the percentage of recovered similar gene pairs (vertical
axis) derived from databases AraCyc (a) and A'l'l'ED-ll (b). The horizontal axis
is the cutoff ranking position that is varied from 10 to 100. The dashed line
represents the results of random selection

information-based similarity (EIS). We then measured how well the
two sets of similarities are aligned with each other. Our assumption
is that a good clustering result of mutant lines should lead to a PPS
that well aligns with the EIS. Below we describe the computation of
PPS and EIS, respectively.

For each mutant line, there are at least four biological replicates
and each replicate may be grouped into a different cluster. By taking
the average of the cluster membership vectors for the replicates, we
derived a three dimensional vector representation 2,- for each mutant
line M). The PPS between any two mutant lines M,- and M,- was
then computed as the similarity between their vector
representations:

PPS(M,-, A4,) = z,T z,-. (9)

The biological knowledge base AraCyc (Zhang et al., 2010), (a
manually curated database providing the metabolic pathway infor—
mation for 46 out of the 338 genes in our study) was used as the
extra information. More precisely, two genes form a similar gene
pair if they are in the same metabolic pathway and we get a total
number of 91 similar gene pairs. Therefore two mutant lines have a
high EIS value if they form a similar gene pair:

1, M1,.M- E similar ene airs
EIS : ( I) g P (10)
0, otherwise.

Next, we measure how well the PPS is aligned with the EIS
derived from AraCyc. For each mutant line M,- that appears in the
similar gene pairs, we ranked all the other genes in descending order
of their PPS with M), and recorded the percentage of the AraCyc—
based similar gene pairs that were recovered by the top ranked genes
with the cutoff rank varied from 10 to 100. Based on our assump—
tion, the larger the percentage of recovered similar gene pairs, the
better the clustering result will be.

Figure 5a summarizes the percentage of similar gene pairs re-
covered by different clustering algorithms using AraCyc. We also

The P-Values indicate the statistical differences between NPM and other clustering methods

included in Figure 5a the result of random selection for each mutant
line as the baseline (highlighted by a dashed line). It shows that the
performance of NPM is significantly better than the other clustering
methods and the random ranking (Kolmogorov—Smirnov test, see
P-values in Table 1) (Press et al., 1992).

Because the EIS computed using AraCyc only covers a portion
of the genes in our study, we repeated the same evaluation steps
with the gene co—expression scores in the ATTED—II database
(Obayashi et al., 2011). Although gene co—expression data is not as
accurate as manually curated data, it includes most of the genes in
our study, and has been well recognized as a reliable source for
performance evaluation (Harr and Schlotterer, 2006). We used
the mutual rank (MR) scores to compute EIS from ATTED-II.
More specifically, we set the threshold of MR to be 20, and
gene pairs with MR scores above this threshold are considered
to be ATTED—based similar gene pairs. We get a total number of
465 similar gene pairs. The results in Figure 5b indicate that the
clustering result generated by NPM has a better correlation with
the biological similarities derived from transcriptional co—expres—
sions than the other clustering methods. A Kolmogorov—Smirnov
test verifies that NPM is statistically significantly better than all
baselines with a significance level of 0.01 on the ATTED-II data-
base (see Table 1).

In summary, the performance evaluations using both the
metabolic pathways and the gene co—expression values show
that the clustering result generated by NPM better correlates
with external biological information than the other clustering
methods.

4.4 Biological significance

We examined the biological significance of selected clustering re—
sults, as shown in Figure 4. Dozens of interesting mutant lines were
discovered from the inter—functional clustering analysis. As a dem—
onstration, we discuss two mutant lines in the following text.

The first one is ch (AT3G24530; goupling factor quick recov—
ery). The ch mutant line harbors a point mutation on the gamma
subunit of the chloroplast ATP synthase, which alters its regulation.
In our analysis, ch belongs to the qE-sensitiz/e cluster (red) which
showed lower values of both p11 and 6113 than wild type. This pheno-
type is consistent with excess enzymatic activity of the chloroplast
ATP synthesis (high gHT), which minimizes pmf formation and sub—
sequently the capacity for photoprotection via the 6113 mechanism
and the ability to slow electron transfer through the cyt b6f com—
plex. Consequently, Photosystem I in these plants is more suscep—
tible to photodamage particularly under ﬂuctuating light, as
confirmed by independent biochemical and spectroscopical methods
(Wu et al., 2007).

The second example is the t—DNA insertion line AT1G44575
(npq4) of the pigment-binding protein PsbS. It is associated with
photosystem II antenna complexes of higher plants and part of the
qE mechanism. In our data, the mutant line had normal p11 but very
low 611;. Its biased distribution was assigned by NPM to the low-qE

cluster (blue). This is reasonable because it is an essential component
of the qE mechanism, but does not affect the regulation of light—
induced electron transfer (Lamesch et al., 2012).

These two examples demonstrate that the clustering approach
can distinguish mutant lines with overlapping effects on multiple
phenotypes. In this case, both ch and npq4 showed low qE but had
distinct effects on electron transfer.

We observe in Figure 4a that the mutant lines in the qE-sensitiz/e
cluster have restricted proton ﬂux through the ATP synthase, result—
ing in high qE sensitivity, and the mutant lines in the low-qE cluster
(blue) have low quenching capacity, causing significantly low 6113 but
normal pH values. Therefore, we hypothesize that skew from the wt-
lilee cluster in the 6113 versus (dm >< light) plot may be used as an indi—
cator for altered activity or regulation of the ATP—synthase.

To verify the hypothesis, we chose four function unknown mu—
tant lines from the cluster results with the most distinct phenotypes
to further explore the relationships among multiple photosynthesis
parameters. From the qE-sensitiz/e cluster, we chose the lines SALK_
106162 and SALK -0725 81, which are T—DNA insertion mutagen of
AT2G29180 and AT4G33520, respectively. AT4G33520 encodes a
putative metal—transporting P—type ATPase, and is involved in cop—
per ion transmembrane transport. AT2G29180 is a function un—
known chloroplast—targeted protein. From the low-qE cluster, we
chose SALK_114469, a T-DNA insertion mutagen of AT1G79040,
which encodes for the PsbR subunit of photosystem II. For compari—
son, we also chose SALK_044616 (AT1G65230) from the wild-type
like cluster.

We first repeated p11 and 6113 measurements under several light
intensities using an Integrated Diode Emitter Array (IDEA) spectro—
photometer, which also allows high—resolution absorbance measure—
ments of other photosynthetic parameters that are not yet possible
to perform using high throughput methods (Hall et al., 2013).
Figure 6 shows the re—measured plants have the same relationships
between 6113 and (p11 >< light) as our high—throughput phenotype val—
ues, indicating the reproducibility of our data is high.

We also measured proton—flux across the thylakoid membrane,
thus the ATP—synthase activity using the same device (Figure 7). As
expected, wt—lilee candidate shows no difference in ATP synthase ac-
tivity compared with wild type (Col—0). Both candidates from the
qE-sensitiz/e cluster have a decreased proton—flux, vH+, compared
with wild type. The lower proton conductivity, gH+, compared with
wild—type, observed in SALK -0725 81 is consistent with downregu—
lation of ATP synthase activity to limit proton ﬂux and favor pmf
formation. Contrary to expectations, SALK_106162 shows margin-
ally higher gH+ despite lower z/HT, consistent with lower steady
state pmf in this mutant compared with wild—type. In this case, the
sensitivity of the 6113 response may be due either an increase in the
fraction of pmf stored as ApH or increased sensitivity of the quench—
ing response to lumen pH. The candidate from the low-qE cluster
showed similar proton ﬂux rates and conductivities compared with
wild type, indicating the loss of 6113 may be due to other factors, e.g.
a decrease in ApH/pmf ratio or loss of a component that inﬂuences
quenching efficiency. In summary, the behavior of the distinct

tions (or loss of function) responsible for the phenotype.

4.5 Experimental results for simulated data

In the second experiment, we created a synthesized dataset with 120
instances. The cloud—of—points representation for each instance M,-
is generated as follows: we randomly chose two out of the three
Gaussian distributions (Figure 8a), and sampled n data points from
the two Gaussians, where n is varied from 20, 30 to 40. There are
totally 3 classes, i.e. Gaussian 1&2, Gaussian 2&3 and Gaussian
1&3. For example, if the two chosen distributions are Gaussian 1
and Gaussian 2, we label this instance M,- as Gaussian 1&2.
The synthetic dataset is available at Supplementary Table S3.
We measured the clustering performance by Normalized
Mutual Information (Priness et al., 2007) defined as
NMI(Q, C) : 21(9,  —I— H(C)), where Q is the ground truth
class label partition, C is the data partition generated by a clustering
algorithm, 1(9, C) measures the mutual information between the
two partitions, and H and H ( C) measure the entropy of the two
partitions, respectively.

Figure 8b summarizes the clustering performance for NPM and
baseline algorithms. As expected, we observed that the clustering
performance of all algorithms improves with increasing number of
samples. We also observe that NPM significantly outperforms the
baseline algorithms. The poor performance of Kmeans—split and
GMM—split suggests that applying clustering algorithms directly to
the measured vectors is not appropriate for the cloud—of—points rep—
resentation. The fact that PCA —I— Kmeans does not significantly out—
perform Kmeans suggests that blind dimensionality reduction may
not be sufficient for handling high dimensionality in data clustering.

5 Conclusion

Sophisticated phenomics measurements are becoming increasingly
important for the discovery of important biological functions and
genes (Bilder et al., 2009). Due to the complexity of phenomics data—
sets, the conventional clustering approaches often fail to identify
genes of distinguished functions because they have to make paramet—
ric assumptions about the underlying data distribution. There is thus
an urgent need for new tools to analyze large and complex phenom-
ics datasets. The NPM method presented here represents an import—
ant advance over existing clustering algorithms because it avoids the
parametric assumption of data distribution. A demonstration of our
method on plant photosynthesis data shows that the proposed tech—
nique is effective in capturing mutant lines with similar photosynthe—
sis profiles in comparison to the conventional clustering algorithms
such as le—means and hierarchical clustering. In the future, we plan
to further improve our analysis by (i) conducting biochemical ex—
periments to validate novel genes with the new phenotypes, and

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The precise identification of functionally and structurally
important residues of a protein is still an open problem, and state-of-
the—art classifiers predict only one or at most two different categories.
Result: We have implemented the classifier CLIPS-4D, which predicts
in a mutually exclusively manner a role in catalysis, ligand-binding or
protein stability for each residue-position of a protein. Each prediction
is assigned a P—value, which enables the statistical assessment and
the selection of predictions with similar quality. CLIPS-4D requires as
input a multiple sequence alignment and a 3D structure of one protein
in PDB format. A comparison with existing methods confirmed state-
of-the—art prediction quality, even though CLIPS-4D classiﬁes more
speciﬁcally than other methods. CLIPS-4D was implemented as a
multiclass support vector machine, which exploits seven sequence-
based and two structure-based features, each of which was shown to
contribute to classification quality. The classification of ligand-binding
sites profited most from the 3D features, which were the assessment
of the solvent accessible surface area and the identification of surface
pockets. In contrast, five additionally tested 3D features did not
increase the classiﬁcation performance achieved with evolutionary
signals deduced from the multiple sequence alignment.

1 INTRODUCTION

An important goal of computational biology is the comprehen-
sive annotation of proteins, which requires to predict a function
and to identify all crucial residues. To assign function to a query
sequence, BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) and other, more sensi-
tive, algorithms of sequence comparison (Séding, 2005) are of
utmost value. However, these methods are per se not capable to
identify residues, which are critical for function or stability; thus,
alternative approaches are needed. One technique is the mapping

of known functional sites based on a sequence alignment (Lopez
et al., 2011), which is named homology transfer. Alternatively, if
the 3D structure of a query is available, algorithms can exploit
structural correspondences with annotated active sites to identify
functional residues (Goyal et al., 2007; Stark and Russell, 2003).
More generally applicable are methods that do not require anno-
tated proteins for comparison but assess each individual residue-
position by means of a knowledge-based scoring system. Owing
to the relevance of this task, a large number of such in silico
approaches have been introduced, which are sequence-based
(Berezin et al., 2004; Capra and Singh, 2007; Casari et al.,
1995; Fischer et al., 2008; Gutman et al., 2005; Huang and
Brutlag, 2001; Lichtarge et al., 1996; Overington et al., 1990;
Sankararaman et al., 2009; Tang et al., 2009; Teppa et al.,
2012) or combine information from sequence and structure of
a protein (Ashkenazy et al., 2010; Capra et al., 2009; Kalinina
et al., 2009; Laskowski et al., 2005a; Panchenko et al., 2004;
Sankararaman et al., 2010; Yahalom et al., 2011; Yao et al.,
2003) to predict one or two functional categories.

As we were interested to classify more speciﬁcally, we have
recently introduced a multiclass support vector machine
(MC-SVM), which we named CLIPS-1D (Janda et al., 2012).
In contrast to other approaches, CLIPS-1D predicts in a mutu-
ally exclusively manner a role in catalysis, ligand-binding or pro-
tein structure by analyzing a multiple sequence alignment
(MSA). Interestingly, not more than seven carefully selected fea-
tures related to the conservation and the abundance of residues
at individual sites and their local sequence neighborhood were
sufﬁcient to attain state-of-the-art performance.

Many of the inferred 3D features are orthogonal to the se-
quence-based features exploited by CLIPS-1D, and therefore we
expected an increase of classiﬁcation quality for a combination
of both. This is why we have systematically determined the clas-
siﬁcation performance for combinations of 1D and 3D features
and selected an optimal combination for a novel classiﬁer, which
we named CLIPS-4D. This program uses the 3D structure of a
single protein chain to deduce the local environment of each
residue and does not use the position of ligands. A comparison
with CLIPS-1D made clear that the prediction of ligand-binding
sites proﬁted most from the integration of 3D features. Our
approach compares favorably with state-of-the-art algorithms,
although this MC—SVM distinguishes catalytic, ligand-binding
and structurally relevant residue-positions.

2 METHODS
2.1 1D features

2.1.] Conservation of a residue-position The conservation measure
JSD(k) (Fischer et al., 2008) has performed better than other conserva-
tion measures (see Capra and Singh, 2007) and was computed for a resi-
due-position k according to

obs _ fbackgr

JSD(k) = H(Kf

) — gm?) — éHtfbrkg’) (1)
f}? is the probability mass function for site k approximated as
jigsaw) = fk(aa,-) by the amino acid frequencies observed in the respect-
ive column k of the MSA; the mean amino acid frequencies as found in
the SwissProt database (Bairoch and preiler, 2000) were taken as back-
ground frequencies j’dekg’. H(.) is Shannon’s entropy (Shannon, 1948).
For classiﬁcation, we used the z-score cons JSD(k):

JSD(k) - MSD

UJSD

COHSJSDUC) = (2)
Mean uJSD and standard deviation cJSD values were determined individu-
ally for each MSA.

2.1.2 Conservation of a sequence neighborhood To characterize the
conservation of a sequence neighborhood, consneib(k) was computed in
analogy to Fischer et al. (2008):

1

€0nSneib(k) = m

2 W1 conSJSD(k + l) (3)
leNeib
Neib = {—3, — 2, — 1, + 1, + 2, + 3} determined the set of neighboring
positions. The weights were w_1 = w+1 = 3, w_2 = w+2 = 2, w_3 = w+3 = 1.
The conservation of position k did not contribute to consneib(k).

2.1.3 Propensities of catalytic sites, ligand-binding sites and posi-
tions important for structure Inspired by Bartlett et al. (2002), three
scores named abund(k, CLASS) were computed:

20
abund(k, CLASS) = Emma iogW (4)
i=1 1

fdekg’(aa,-) were the above background frequencies, and fCLASS(aa,-) were
the frequencies of residues from one set CLASS E{CA T _sites, LIG_sites,
S TR U C_sites}. For the analysis of a single sequence with CLIPS-3D (see
later in the text), fk(aa,-) was 1.0 for aa’sC and zero for all other residues.

2.1.4 Scoring propensities of a neighborhood To assess the class-
speciﬁc neighborhood of a site k, we introduced

20 fCLASS(aa_|aa)
I 1 k+l 1 S
INeibI 16;. Emma“) 0g ﬁreman
(5)

Here, aa’sC is the amino acid aas occurring at site k under consideration,
fk+,(aa,-) is the frequency of aa, at position 1 relative to k, and

abundneib(aa’;, CLASS) =

kffSS(aa,-|aas) is the conditional frequency of aa, at the same positional
offset deduced from the neighborhood of all residues aas of a set CLASS.
Neib is the :l:3 neighborhood.

2.2 3D Features

2.2.1 Conservation of a 3D neighborhood To characterize the con-
servation of a 3D neighborhood of a residue aak in a protein,
3D — consneib(k) was computed in analogy to Formula (3):

1

3D — COI’lSnel-bUC) = 

Z COHSJSD (I) (6)

le3D—Neib

3D-Neib is the set of all residues aa, in the vicinity of k possessing an
atom, such that the distance between van der Waals spheres of at least
one pair of sidechain heavy atoms (atomr, atoms) with atom, from aak is at
most 0.5 cons JSD(l) is a normalized Jensen—Shannon divergence; see
Formula (2).

2.2.2 Scoring propensities of a 3D neighborhood To assess the
class-speciﬁc 3D neighborhood, we introduced

3D — abundneib(aaf, CLASS) =

1 2° fCLASS(aa-|aa ) (7)
—_ (mi 10 l#
'31) _ Nelbl [631;Veibi221ﬁ( ) g ﬁaCkgrmai)

Here, aa’sC is the amino acid aas occurring at site k under consideration,
f,(aa,-) is the frequency of aa, at position I, and ffLASS(aa,-|aas) is the
conditional frequency of aa, deduced from the neighborhood of all resi-
dues aas of a set CLASS. The set 3D-Neib was determined as previously
mentioned.

2.2.3 Mutual information score of a 3D neighborhood As pro-
posed (Buslje et al., 2010), we determined a proximity score pMI,
which assesses the mutual information of pairs of residue-positions in
the vicinity of k.
1
MI k = — MI 8
p () I3D_Ne,bl Z c (I) ()

l E3D—Neib

cMI(l) is a cumulative mutual information value (see Buslje et al., 2010),
and 3D-Neib was determined as previously mentioned.

2.2.4 Assessing the B-factor of a residue In analogy to Petrova and
Wu (2006), a normalized B-factor BF(k) was computed.

BF(k) = (9)

UBFmean

BFmean(k) is the mean B-factor deduced from all n atoms of residue aak
according to

BFmean(k) = £ZBFA(atom,-) (10)
i=1

and uBFmean and oBFmean are the mean and the standard-deviation deter-
mined individually for each 3D structure.

2.2.5 Computing the relative solvent-accessible surface
area Using the software library BALL (Hildebrandt et al., 2010), the
solvent-accessible surface area (SASA) was deduced from the protein 3D
structure for each residue aak to compute the relative SASA (rSASA).

SASA(aak)
SASAmaX(aak)

Here, SASAmax(aak) is the maximally possible SASA (Miller et al., 1987)
of the amino acid.

rSASA(aak) = (11)

2.2.6 Assessing pockets As has been shown, fpocket (Le Guilloux
et al., 2009) is one of the best methods for the identiﬁcation of pockets in
proteins (V olkamer et al., 2010). fpocket scores cavities of the protein
surface based on a Voronoi tessellation and alpha spheres. To compen-
sate for the protein-speciﬁc number of pockets, we determined a normal-
ized score nPocket.

max(Pocke tScore)

(12)

P k t =
n 06 8 (Wk) PocketScore(aak)
max(PocketScore) is the largest score deduced for any pocket of the con-
sidered protein, and PocketScore(aak) is the score of the pocket in which
aak is allocated. We assigned a score of —1 to all residues that did not
belong to pockets or whose rSASA value was <4%.

2.2.7 Evaluation of the classification performance To assess the

performance of a classiﬁcation, the rates Sensitivity (Recall), Speciﬁcity

and Precision

TP

TP + FP
(13)

were determined as well as areas under the precision-recall curve

GDR-AUC). As a further performance measure, the Matthews correlation

coefﬁcient (MCC) has been introduced (Matthews, 1975).

_ TP- TN — FP - FN

_ \/(TP + FN)(TP + FP)(TN + FP)(TN + FN)

T P TN
Sensitivity = m , Specificity = m , Precision =

MCC

 

(14)

 

MCC-values are considered a fair measure to assess performance on
unbalanced sets of positives and negatives (Ezkurdia et al., 2009), as
observed here. In all formulae, TP is the number of true positives, TN
the number of true negatives, FP the number of false positives, and FN
the number of false negatives. For example, when classifying catalytic
sites, positives are the selected CA T_sites, and negatives are all other
residue-positions of the considered MSAs.

2.2.8 Classifying by means of SVMs CLIPS-4D was conﬁgured
and trained as described for CLIPS-1D (Janda et al., 2012). We used
the libsvm library (Chang and Lin, 2011) with a Gaussian radial basis
function kernel and determined optimal parameters yRBF and C during
training by means of a grid search (Schélkopf and Smola, 2002). Training
and assessment was organized as an 8-fold cross validation. For each
training step, the number of positive and negative cases was balanced.
To eliminate sampling bias during the grid search, all parameters were
deduced as means from training trials with the same positives and 50
different randomly selected sets of negative cases. In contrast to training,
all positive and all negative cases were classiﬁed to compute performance
measures (e. g. MCC-values). The output of the MC-SVM consists of four
class-probabilities pCLASS (see Wu et al., 2004) for each residue-position.
Each residue-positions k was assigned to the class, whose pCLASS—value
was largest. P—values were determined as follows: For each class and each
residue, the respective cumulative distribution was deduced from the
pCLASS-values of residue-positions l belonging to NOANN_sites. That
is, the P-value for a Glu-residue with pSTRUC-value s(k) is the fraction
of all Glu-residues from NOANN_sites reaching or surpassing s(k).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Selecting an optimal combination of 1D and
3D features

For training and testing SVMs on a combination of 1D and 3D
features, we used the set of MSAs prepared for CLIPS-1D
(Janda et al., 2012) and supplemented the respective pdb-ﬁles
(Dutta et al., 2009). In brief, all MSAs were taken from the
HSSP database (Sander and Schneider, 1991), and each resi-
due-position was assigned to one of four sets (classes) represent-
ing functional categories. The set CAT _sites consists of 840
catalytic residue-positions, which are listed in the manually
curated part of the Catalytic Site Atlas (CSA, Version 2.2.12)
(Porter et al., 2004) and come from 264 enzymes. For 216 of
these enzymes, we found 4466 ligand-binding sites in the
pdbsum database (Laskowski et al., 2005b), which constitute
the dataset LIG_sites. Owing to the lack of a representative set
of proteins, which are annotated with structurally important resi-
due-positions, we regarded conserved residues in the core of pro-
teins important for structure. Thus, we have handpicked 136
proteins without enzymatic function and identiﬁed 3703

residue-positions, which were both buried and more conserved
than the mean; see Janda et al. (2012). This set was named
ST RU C_sites; the remaining 19 223 residue-positions were
named NOANN_sites and represented residue-positions without
crucial function. During training and testing, residue-positions
from one set CLASS 6 { CA T _sites, LIG_sites, ST RUC_sites }
and from NOANN_sites served as positive or negative cases to
train six two-class SVMs; for details, see Janda et al. (2012).

For CLIPS-1D, we have chosen seven sequence-based features
for classiﬁcation: cons JSD(k) [Formula (2)] assesses the conserva-
tion of individual residue-positions and consne,b(k) [Formula (3)]
assesses the conservation of their neighborhood. abund(k, CLASS)
[Formula (4)] scores the abundance of residues at functionally or
structurally important sites and abundne,b(k, CA T _sites) and
abundneib(k, LIG_sites) [Formula (5)] score the composition in
the neighborhood of functionally important sites.

To this end, six more features, which require a 3D structure for
their computation, were selected as candidates for a combination
with the aforementioned sequence-based features. Two are 3D
versions of sequence-based conservation scores: 3D — consnel-b(k)
[Formula (6)] scores the conservation of residues in the 3D neigh-
borhood of residue-position k and 3D — abundneib(aa’s‘, CLASS)
assesses the class-speciﬁc abundance of residues in the 3D neigh-
borhood of amino acid aas at position k [Formula (7)]. pMI(k)
[Formula (8)] scores dependencies of residue distributions in the
vicinity of residue k and has been reported as improving the
prediction of catalytic sites (Buslje et al., 2010). The biochemical
role of a residue may affect its ﬂexibility, which can be estimated
with the mean B-factor BF(k) (Petrova and Wu, 2006) computed
according to Formula (9). The relative solvent accessible surface
area rSASA(k) [Formula (11)] allows for the differentiation of
surface and core residues. Catalytic and ligand-binding sites tend
to lie in surface pockets Wolkamer et al., 2010); thus, we used
the normalized score nPocket(k) according to Formula (12) as a
further feature.

Before ﬁnding an optimal combination of features, we were
interested to corroborate the contribution of evolutionary infor-
mation and of 3D data to classiﬁcation quality. Thus, we
combined those features that do not require an MSA for classi-
ﬁcation and named the resulting MC-SVM CLIPS-3D. We chose
abund(k, CLASS), which scores the abundance of residues in
functionally or structurally important sites (Janda et al., 2012),
and the 3D features 3D — abundneib(aaf, CLASS), rSASA(k) and
nPocket(k). CLIPS-3D was trained and assessed by means of an
8-fold cross validation on the aforementioned classes. The output
of this and all other MC—SVMs of the CLIPS-suite is for each
residue-position a set of four class probabilities pCLASS(k)
WVu et al., 2004), which were taken to assign k to the class
with the highest probability.

Generally, it is difﬁcult to characterize the performance of a
classiﬁer, if the number of positive and negative cases is highly
unbalanced as is also the case here. A fair measure (Ezkurdia
et al., 2009) is the MCC [Formula (14)], which was computed for
all analyses; see Table 1. Comparing the MCC-values of CLIPS-
1D and CLIPS-3D shows that evolutionary information is
important to predict CA T _sites and ST RU C_sites, and that 3D
data contribute markedly to the prediction of LIG_sites.

Next, we combined each of the aforementioned 3D features and
all CLIPS-1D features to train and assess six different MC—SVMs

analogously. The comparison with MCC-values of CLIPS-1D
made clear that only rSASA and nPocket improved classiﬁcation
performance and that the classiﬁcation of LIG_sites proﬁted most
by the latter two features (Table 1). Further performance tests
showed that the assessment of a residue’s neighborhood in 3D
space did not outperform the respective 1D features. Thus, we
combined the seven sequenced-based features of CLIPS-1D with
rSASA and nPocket to form the classiﬁer CLIPS-4D. Compared
with CLIPS-1D, the MCC-values increased from 0.34 to 0.43 for
CAT _sites, from 0.12 to 0.27 for LIG_sites and from 0.67 to 0.68
for ST R U C_sites. As the respective MCC-value was optimal, if
CA T _sites with pCA7(k) >0.64 were selected as positives, we im-
plemented this cutoff for functional assignment. For the output of
CLIPS-4D, we additionally determined a residue-speciﬁc P—value,
which indicates the fraction of NOANN_sites reaching or surpass-
ing the considered pCLASS-value (see Section 2.2.8). Using P-
values in the range of 0.01—0.20 as cutoffs, MCC-values as well
as Sensitivity (Recall), Speciﬁcity and Precision [Formulae (13)]
of CLIPS-4D were determined (Table 2 and Supplementary

Table 1. MCC-values of classiﬁers for crucial residue-positions

 

 

Classiﬁer CA T_sites LIG_sites S TR U C_sites
CLIPS-3D 0.31 0.22 0.43
CLIPS-1D 0.34 0.12 0.67
3D — conSJSD 0.29 0.10 0.69
3D — abundnel-b 0.32 0.11 0.66
pMI 0.34 0.09 0.64
BF 0.32 0.11 0.66
rSASA 0.34 0.13 0.63
nPocket 0.37 0.27 0.68
CLIPS-4D 0.43 0.27 0.68
ConSurf 0.30 0.46

 

Note: For all variants of the CLIPS classiﬁer, MCC-values for the classiﬁcation of
CAT_sites, LIG_sites and STRUC_sites are listed. CLIPS-3D is based on seven
propensities or structure-based features, which do not require an MSA for compu-
tation, and CLIPS-1D uses seven sequence-based features. Each of the lines labeled
3D — cons 131), 3D — abundneib, pMI, BF, rSASA and nPocket gives the performance
of an MC—SVM exploiting the seven CLIPS-1D features plus the listed 3D feature.
CLIPS-4D is a classiﬁer using the seven CLIPS-1D features plus rSASA and nPocket.
The classiﬁer ConSurf does not distinguish catalytic and ligand-binding sites.
Therefore, we merged the sets CA T_sites and LIG_sites before classiﬁcation.

Fig. S1). MCC-values of CA T _sites and LIG_sites reached a plat-
eau for P 2 0.05. Thus, we recommend the P—value of 0.05 for the
selection of functional sites, as sensitivity is acceptable and speci-
ﬁcity is then as high as 0.99, 0.95 and 0.96 for CAT _sites,
LIG_sites and ST RU C_sites; compare Table 2.

In summary, the ﬁnal conﬁguration of CLIPS-4D is an
MC—SVM, which classiﬁes based on nine features. These are
the seven sequence-based features consne,b(k), abund(k, CLASS)
and abundneib(aa’s‘, CLASS), plus the two 3D features rSASA(k)
and nPocket(k). CLIPS-4D is available as a web service at http://
www-bioinf.uni-regensburg.de; this version was trained on the
full datasets. An assessment of typical output is provided as
Supplementary Data.

3.2 Classiﬁcation performance of CLIPS-4D varies in a
class- and residue-speciﬁc manner

Owing to their biochemical properties, residues are not evenly
distributed at functionally or structurally important positions.
For example, only 11 residues are generally observed as being
directly involved in catalysis (Bartlett et al., 2002), and few resi-
dues are overrepresented at catalytic sites. The charged residues
Lys, Glu, Arg, Asp and His as well as Cys are the only residues
with an abund(k, CA T _sites)-value>0.5, whereas Pro and the
hydrophobic residues Val, Ile, Leu and Ala are scored< —2.0,
i.e. are drastically underrepresented. To characterize classiﬁcation
performance in detail, we determined in a class-speciﬁc manner
MCC-values for each individual residue. In Figure 1, these MCC-
values were plotted versus abundance scores. For CA T _sites, all of
the overrepresented residues were classiﬁed with an MCC-
value> 0.33. In contrast, the underrepresented residues Ala, Gly
and Phe had an MCC-value of zero; no MCC-value could be
computed for the underrepresented residues Pro, Val, Ile, Leu
and Met due to missing values. The abund(k, LIG_sites)-scores
were less extreme, indicating that more types of residues are
involved in ligand-binding than in catalysis. MCC-values were
lowest (<0.13) for the underrepresented residues Glu and Lys
but also for the overrepresented residues Asp, Arg and His.
These three residues were also observed as CA T _sites, which
might explain why some ligand-binding sites were misclassiﬁed
as catalytic ones. Among ST RU C_sites, the MCC-values were
generally higher (mean 0.63) and for the hydrophobic residues
Ala, Val, Ile, Leu, Met, Phe, Tyr and Trp the mean was 0.73.

Note: All values were determined according to Formulae (13) and (14). The speciﬁc results for the classes CA T_sites, LIG_sites and STRUC_sites are listed in the columns
labeled ‘CAT’, ‘LIG’, and ‘STRUC’, respectively.

Fig. 1. Class-speciﬁc performance of CLIPS-4D for individual residues. In
a class-speciﬁc manner, MCC-values were determined for each residue and
plotted versus the respective abundance values abund(k, CLASS). The
rareness of residues P, V, I, L and M among CA T_sites precluded to
compute MCC-values. Thus, they were assigned an MCC-value of —0.1

Classiﬁcation performance was lowest for the two less abundant
residues His and Lys. In summary, these ﬁndings indicate that
classiﬁcation performance varies to a great extent depending on
residues and their function. This is why we introduced P—values,
which allow the user to select predictions of similar quality for all
classes and sites. A detailed analysis of class-speciﬁc misclassiﬁca—
tions was added to the Supplementary Data.

3.3 The more speciﬁc classification of CLIPS-4D reaches
the same performance as less speciﬁc alternatives

Methods for the identiﬁcation of functionally important residues
can be divided into homology transfer methods and other

approaches that do not use knowledge about binding sites in a
homologous protein for a prediction. As CLIPS-4D belongs to
the second group, we comprehensively compared its performance
with other methods following the same approach.

DISCERN (Sankararaman et al., 2010) and POOL
(Somarowthu et al., 2011) use 1D and 3D features to predict
functionally important residue-positions. On a subset of the
CSA, a recall of 0.50 at a precision of 0.19 was determined for
DISCERN (Sankararaman et al., 2010); CLIPS-4D reached for
this recall a precision of 0.32. For a subset of 100 enzymes from
the CSA and a false-positive rate of 0.05, POOL had a recall of
0.87 at a precision of 0.15 (Somarowthu et al., 2011). For
P=0.05, the recall of CLIPS-4D was 0.47 at a precision of
0.34; compare Table 2. ConCavity, which focusses on ligand-
binding residues, reaches a PR—AUC value of 0.65 for entries
of the LigASite database and one of 0.32 for catalytic sites of
the CSA (Capra et al., 2009). CLIPS-4D reaches PR—AUC values
of 0.23 for LIG_sites and of 0.30 for CAT _sites, respectively
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Most plausibly, the lower performance
of CLIPS-4D on LIG_sites is due to the pdbsum-speciﬁc choice
of ligands (which include metal ions) and ligand-binding resi-
dues. However, the MCC-value of 0.56 reached by CLIPS-4D
for the difﬁcult case of CASP9 target T0604 (Schmidt et al.,
2011) suggests the prediction of a substantial number of biologic-
ally relevant ligand-bindings sites; see later in the text.

An alternative to CLIPS-4D is ConSurf, which predicts two
distinct categories, namely, functionally or structurally important
residue-positions. ConSurf is available as a web service and
deduces a measure for evolutionary conservation from an
MSA (Ashkenazy et al., 2010). The overall performance of
ConSurf was better when we uploaded our preprocessed MSAs
instead of letting ConSurf generate MSAs on its own (data not
shown). Additionally, performance of ConSurf was best if we
classiﬁed residues having assigned the maximal conservation
score of 9 as positive and all other residues as negative cases.
We presumed a structural role if the residue was buried
(rSASA<5%) and a functional role if it was exposed to the
solvent (rSASA Z 5%). As ConSurf does not distinguish between
catalytic and ligand-binding sites, we merged CA T _sites and
LIG_sites before the assessment. The resulting MCC-value of
0.30 was closer to the MCC-value reached by CLIPS-4D for
LIG_sites, which corresponds to their overrepresentation in the
merged datasets. For ST RUC_sites, the MCC-value was 0.46;
see Table 1.

In summary, these comparisons conﬁrmed state-of-the-art per-
formance for CLIPS-4D, which offers a broader classiﬁcation
spectrum than alternatives.

3.4 CLIPS-4D can supplement homology transfer meth-
ods in the prediction of ligand-binding sites

In the ligand-binding site prediction category of CASP, it is the
task to predict residues directly involved in ligand binding in the
experimental control structure. The results of CASP9 (Schmidt
et al., 2011) and CASP10 experiments (http://www.prediction—
center.org/casp10/) impressively demonstrate that most ligand-
binding residues can be predicted with high performance by
homology transfer methods. However, if the ligand is large and
ﬂexible, it is difﬁcult to predict the full binding site, as indicated

by a lower performance (MCC-value of ~0.5 for best-performing
methods) on CASP9 target T0604 (Schmidt et al., 2011).
Additionally, substrates tend not to be crystallized in proteins,
and their binding residues are more family speciﬁc. Thus, we
hypothesized that CLIPS-4D might supplement homology trans-
fer by predicting additional residues that bind substrates or non-
metal ligands.

First, we conﬁrmed that CLIPS-4D predictions help to iden-
tify substrate or product binding sites of the enzymes IGPS
(1A53), LgtC (1G9R), HIT (lKPF) and TIM (1M7P); pdb ids
are given in brackets. In each of these and the following cases,
the sets CAT _sites and LIG_sites were merged before assessing
in a CASP-related manner the performance for residues bind-
ing non-metal ligands. A detailed analysis was added as
Supplementary Data.

Second, we compared the outcome of CLIPS-4D and firestar
(Lopez et al., 2011), a top-performing method, for those cases of
CASP9 where the MCC-value of the best-performing participant
of the contest was lowest (Schmidt et al., 2011). We selected ﬁve
targets with a non-metal ligand, namely, T0526, T0584, T0604,
T0615 and T0632. Owing to the lack of sufﬁciently large MSAs
or unavailable 3D structures, we could only analyze one non-
metal target of CASP10, namely T0721. Results were summar-
ized in Table 3 and listed as Supplementary Data. In two of the
six cases (T0526, T0604), the MCC-value of CLIPS-4D was
superior to firestar. A union of the predictions generated by
firestar and CLIPS-4D gave in comparison with firestar for
two more cases (T0615, T0721) a higher sensitivity at the cost
of a moderate loss in speciﬁcity.

Among these six CASP targets, the performance of CLIPS-4D
was worst for T0584 (pdb id 3NF 2). T0584 is a polyprenyl trans-
ferase generating the product from the building blocks isopente-
nyl diphosphate and dimethylallyl diphosphate (DMAPP) by
consecutive steps of elongation, cyclopropagation, rearrange-
ment and cyclization reactions WVallrapp et al., 2013). During
synthesis, the product grows into an elongation cavity, and mu-
tagenesis studies made clear that residues protruding into the

elongation cavity determine the length of the product (Liang
et al., 2002). Two pairs of aspartates of Asp-rich regions are
involved in binding DMAPP and catalysis via chelation of the
cofactor Mg2+. Five residues from these Asp-rich regions shown
to be important for catalysis (Liang et al., 2002) were predicted
by CLIPS-4D as CAT _sites. Four of these residues are not
directly involved in ligand binding in the experimental control
structure 1RQI and are thus false-positive predictions as well as
41 LIG_sites. Of these, 18 line the elongation cavity modeled
previously (Tarshis et al., 1996). Three more LIG_sites most
likely contact the ligand after an active site rearrangement; see
Supplementary Data for details. Therefore, experimental evi-
dence makes plausible some of these predictions that do not
belong to the extended binding site.

Thus, although not representative due to the small number
of analyses, these ﬁndings suggest to supplement the result of
homology transfer with CLIPS-4D predictions in cases of active
site rearrangements, ﬂexible substrates or unknown poses of a
ligand.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The combination of evolutionary and 3D data allows CLIPS-4D
to predict critical residue-positions with state-of-the-art quality.
As shown here, not more than nine features are sufﬁcient to
reach state-of-the-art classiﬁcation performance, if features are
orthogonal to each other. The sequence- and structure-based
features contribute differently to the identiﬁcation of func-
tionally and structurally important residue-positions: For the
identiﬁcation of catalytic and structurally important sites, se-
quence-based features like conservation are most relevant, for
ligand-binding sites 3D features indicating a position in a surface
pocket contribute markedly to classiﬁcation quality. Assessing
the content of the CSA made clear that these residues, which
were frequently found at catalytic sites could be identiﬁed with
high quality. In contrast, the identiﬁcation of residues, which are
rare at catalytic sites, and those of ligand-binding sites is still a

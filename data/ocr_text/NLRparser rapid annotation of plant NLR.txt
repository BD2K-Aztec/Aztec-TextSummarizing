Abstract

Motivation: The repetitive nature of plant disease resistance genes encoding for nucleotide-
binding Ieucine-rich repeat (NLR) proteins hampers their prediction with standard gene annotation
software. Motif alignment and search tool (MAST) has previously been reported as a tool to
support annotation of NLR-encoding genes. However, the decision if a motif combination repre-
sents an NLR protein was entirely manual.

Results: The NLR-parser pipeline is designed to use the MAST output from six-frame translated
amino acid sequences and filters for predefined biologically curated motif compositions. Input
reads can be derived from, for example, raw long-read sequencing data or contigs and scaffolds
coming from plant genome projects. The output is a tab-separated file with information on start
and frame of the first NLR specific motif, whether the identified sequence is a TNL or CNL, poten-
tially full or fragmented. In addition, the output of the NB-ARC domain sequence can directly be
used for phylogenetic analyses. In comparison to other prediction software, the highly complex
NB-ARC domain is described in detail using several individual motifs.

Availability and implementation: The NLR-parser tool can be downloaded from Git-Hub
(github.com/steuernb/NLR-Parser). It requires a valid Java installation as well as MAST as part of
the MEME Suite. The tool is run from the command line.

1 Introduction

Plants have evolved a multi-layered innate immune system to protect
themselves against pests and pathogens (Jones and Dangl, 2006).
Breeding efforts towards disease resistance in crops rely on the
introgression of quantitative trait loci or major dominant disease
resistance (R) genes from wild relatives (reviewed in (Dangl et al.,
2013). The largest class of R genes encodes nucleotide-binding
domain leucine-rich repeat proteins (NLRs or NB—LRRs). These are
key receptors that recognize secreted pathogen effector molecules or
their effect in the plant. On recognition, these proteins commonly
lead to a hypersensitive response in the form of local cell death to

prevent further spread of pathogens relying on living tissue (Jones
and Dangl, 2006).

In dicotyledonous plants, NLR proteins come in two flavours that
are determined by an N-terminal extension and internal amino acid
motif composition. CNL proteins possess in most cases a coiled-coil
domain followed by the highly conserved p-loop and RNBS-A motif
(Meyers et al., 2003). TNL proteins possess a Toll-interleukin recep-
tor-like (TIR) domain followed by the p-loop but lack the RNBS-A
motif. The TNL class is absent from monocotyledonous plants, like
wheat and barley. A set of 20 NLR descriptive motifs have previously
been identified using MEME (Bailey et al., 2009), and were used in

motif alignment and search tool (MAST) searches against predicted
potato proteins (Jupe et al., 2012). Originally set out to discover NLR
sequences from members of the plant family Solanaceae, this set also
contains two Triticeae specific motifs.

The identification and annotation of the very large NLR gene
family, with for example over 750 members in potato, is currently
very laborious and time-consuming, as most automated gene callers
fail to capture the full complement. Several studies have shown that
these automated annotations miss up to 50% of the total NLR gene
complement, or that full sequences are split into small fragments
and then annotated as ‘partial’ (Meyers et al., 2003; Jupe et al.,
2013; Andolfo et al., 2014).

There is, therefore, a clear need for an automated NLR annota-
tion tool. Here, we present an NLR-MAST-parser, a java applica-
tion for the identification of NLR-like sequences that uses the highly
specific amino acid motif composition found in plant NLR gene
products and parses this information into an easy-to-use tabular file.
The impact of this tool comes from a high accuracy, reduction in
hands-on time of NLR annotation projects and its independence
from gene prediction software. We further provide evidence that it is
functional in monocotyledonous and dicotyledonous plant species.

2 Methods

2.1 Motif composition discriminates NLRs

The amino acid motif composition of NLR gene products is highly
conserved amongst all plant species, sufficient to separate these
from other protein sequences and sufficient to separate the two
main types of NLRs (TNL and CNL). We use 20 previously bio-
logically characterized motifs (Jupe et al., 2012) in the MAST tool
to identify potential NLR encoding sequences. The NLR parser uses
a variety of biologically defined input motif compositions to search
the MAST xml-format output and report on confirmed NLRs only.
These motif compositions can be found in the online manual.

2.2 Mast parser features

The annotation of NLR genes is a manual process that is simplified
by several output features of this NLR parser. The MAST input is a
protein sequence, which is usually not available from, for example
de novo assembled genomes or NLR-enriched sequence data. The
best procedure to identify NLRs in a set of sequences is to perform a
translation into all six reading frames. The MAST Parser accepts a
pattern, which splits a common prefix from frame-specific suffixes,
as an input argument. That way, every nucleotide sequence can be
annotated, regardless of the actual reading frame or even a shift of
the frame. It has been shown that NLR genes are often under selec-
tion (Michelmore and Meyers, 1998), resulting in a large number of
pseudogenes. We defined sets of motifs that indicate the complete-
ness of an NLR gene. The output of the Mast Parser includes this
annotation as a column. Finally, we add the class of each NLR, i.e.
CNL or TNL, to the output.

2.3 TAIR validation

In a proof-of-concept study, we screened the available set of
Arabidopsis thaliana TAIR proteins (TAIR10_pep_20101214) for
NLR gene products using the here presented MAST pipeline. In
total, we identified 266 from within 35 386 Arabidopsis proteins as
partial or complete NLRs. The original TAIR protein annotation
provides 219 sequences with one of the following annotation terms:
‘Toll-Interleukin-Resistance (TIR) domain’, ‘NB-ARC’ or
‘NBS-LRR’ and 212 of these were also identified with our MAST
pipeline. Blastp analyses of the seven remaining proteins identified

two false-negatives with an NB-ARC and LRR domains, but five
that had neither an NB-ARC nor an LRR domain and thus can be
excluded. Detailed analysis shows that the two false-negatives cor-
respond to the ancient and small group of NLRs with similarity to
ADR1 (Chini and Loake, 2005). Here, the discriminatory Motif 8
had a P-value of 8e—5 and was, therefore, discarded. We, therefore,
observe a sensitivity of more than 99%. We found five complete
NLRs with the NLR-Parser that were not annotated accordingly in
TAIR. We validated the structure of those proteins by scanning for
TIR, NB-ARC and LRR-related PFAM domains using HMMER
(Eddy, 201 1) and found consistently an NB-ARC domain and LRRs
in each of the protein sequences (Supplementary Table 1).
Therefore, we report a 100% specificity for the NLR-Parser.

2.4 Monocot validation

We further tested the MEME motifs in our NLR-parser for their
functionality in monocotyledonous plant genomes and screened the
publicly available set of annotated genes from Brachypodium dis-
tachyon. The NLR-parser pipeline identified 586 partial or complete
NLRs. All 190 proteins that the NLR-parser annotated as complete
NLRs have previously been annotated as resistance genes (http://
phytozome.jgi.doe.govl). The general quality of the Brachypodium
annotation, relying on similarity to Arabidopsis and rice does not
allow a precise estimation of sensitivity and selectivity. However,
there is a good consistency between annotation, found PFAM do-
mains and NLR-Parser. Eight genes with NB-ARC domain and LRR
have not been found by the NLR-Parser, including an ADR1-like.
Conversely, the NLR-Parser annotated 47 proteins as complete
NLRs while HMMER only detected the NB-ARC domain, not any
LRR (Supplementary Table 2).

3 Discussion

Due to the biological importance and relevance for breeding, the
identification and annotation of NLR-type disease resistance genes
has high priority in all plant genome sequencing projects. These
annotations, however, rely heavily on gene-prediction software. In
the past, we were able to show that up to 50% of the total NLR
complement was either wrongly predicted or completely missing.
Our MAST Parser tool provides high precision identification of
NLR gene sequences from every input format that is available from
genome sequencing projects including contigs, scaffolds, pseudomo-
lecules or chromosomes. In two experiments with the model plants
A. thaliana and B. distachyon, we were able to show the functional-
ity of the 20 well-characterized MEME motifs in monocotyledonous
and dicotyledonous plants. The output of this tool is directly usable
for downstream applications including phylogenetic analyses, or
visualization on the corresponding reference sequence. The tab de-
limited output format is publishable as a Supplementary Table.

4 Conclusion

The MAST Parser pipeline that we present here will streamline NLR
identification efforts within genome sequencing projects in mono-
cotyledonous and dicotyledonous plants.

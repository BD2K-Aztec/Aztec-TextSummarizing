Abstract

Motivation: Long arrays of near—identical tandem repeats are a common feature of centromeric
and subtelomeric regions in complex genomes. These sequences present a source of repeat struc—
ture diversity that is commonly ignored by standard genomic tools. Unlike reads shorter than the
underlying repeat structure that rely on indirect inference methods, e.g. assembly, long reads allow
direct inference of satellite higher order repeat structure. To automate characterization of local
centromeric tandem repeat sequence variation we have designed Alpha—CENTAURI (ALPHA satel—
lite CENTromeric AUtomated Repeat Identification), that takes advantage of Pacific Bioscience
long—reads from whole—genome sequencing datasets. By operating on reads prior to assembly, our
approach provides a more comprehensive set of repeat—structure variants and is not impacted by
rearrangements or sequence underrepresentation due to misassembly.

Results: We demonstrate the utility of Alpha—CENTAURI in characterizing repeat structure for alpha
satellite containing reads in the hydatidiform mole (CHM1, haploid—like) genome. The pipeline is
designed to report local repeat organization summaries for each read, thereby monitoring
rearrangements in repeat units, shifts in repeat orientation and sites of array transition into non—
satellite DNA, typically defined by transposable element insertion. We validate the method by
showing consistency with existing centromere high order repeat references. Alpha—CENTAURI can,
in principle, run on any sequence data, offering a method to generate a sequence repeat resolution
that could be readily performed using consensus sequences available for other satellite families in
genomes without high—quality reference assemblies.

1 Introduction

Centromeres and other heterochromatic regions in most complex gen-
omes are enriched with long arrays of near—identical tandem repeats,
known as satellite DNAs, which challenge standard assembly efforts
and are vastly underrepresented in genomic studies (Eichler et al.,
2004; Willard, 1990). Local arrangements of the fundamental repeat
unit, or monomers, within each satellite array are commonly organized
into multi-monomeric repeating units or, higher—order repeats (HORs;
Willard and Waye, 1987a). These sites are observed to be highly vari—
able in copy number and repeat structure (Warburton and Willard,
1990; Warburton et al., 1993), providing a new and largely uncharac—
terized source of sequence variation to study in the context of sequence
evolution and biomedical research. Previous efforts to characterize re—
peat variants from whole—genome sequencing (WGS) data relied on
predictions made by short read assembly or k-mer frequency (Alkan
et al., 2007; Macas et al., 2010). Although useful in predicting the
most common repeat unit organizations in a given genome, such strat—
egies are not designed to efficiently survey local rearrangement of re-
peat patterns involving variant sequence organization between
adjacent repeats, precise sites of inversion in arrays and transition
boundaries with non—satellite DNA that may interrupt an array. In
contrast, long read analysis, where a complete repeating unit can be
observed in its entirety more than once, enables direct characterization
of these events without assembly based inference (Melters et al., 2013).

To automate the survey of repeat variants in quality—assessed
long read datasets, we developed Alpha—CENTAURI (ALPHA satel-
lite CENTromeric AUtomated Repeat Identification), a bioinfor—
matics pipeline for evaluating local HOR structure across long read
WGS datasets. When provided with long—read data and a training
dataset of repeat units from a satellite family of interest, Alpha-
CENTAURI is designed to predict HOR patterns based on cluster—
ing discrete repeat units on each read. In doing so, the user is pro—
vided with characterization of HOR structure on the read: defined
either as regular, or containing the same ordering of near—identical
monomers, or irregular, that is, containing a rearrangement, inver-
sion or discontinuous spacing in monomers when compared to other
HORs on the same read. Further, regions of the read that do not
contain an identifiable repeat unit are flagged to go through a sec—
ondary analysis using Repbase libraries (Jurka et al., 2005) to label
sites of characterized repeat insertions. We demonstrate the utility
of Alpha-CENTAURI on WGS data from a hydatiform mole gen—
ome (CHM1), using a collection of previously characterized 171 bp
monomers from an AT-rich human centromeric satellite family,
known as alpha satellite (Manuelidis and Wu, 1978).

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Higher order repeat prediction of ordered
monomers

Alpha-CENTAURI’s workﬂow is designed to detect tandem repeats
containing at least two ordered monomers (i.e. dimers), providing a
minimal definition for HOR prediction (Willard and Waye, 1987b)
(Fig. 1). As outlined in Figure 1a, the user is initially required to pro—
vide two input databases: (i) a file of quality—assessed long reads and
(ii) a monomer training set of fasta sequences to define the basic re—
peat unit for a given satellite family. Initial monomer positions are
determined using a hidden Markov method using a satellite model
provided by the input consensus sequence (HMMER, Eddy, 1998).
Minimum monomer lengths are defined by default to be 150 bases.
Characterization of discrete, ordered monomer units provide an
index of start positions for each read. Monomers are clustered into

Fig. 1. Alpha-CENTAURI workflow and the HOR detection algorithm illus-
trated. (a) The workflow. Alpha-CENTAURI takes two input files: a FASTA file
containing long reads and an HMM database built using known alpha-satellite
monomers. The HMM database is used to infer monomeric sequences in each
read. Then, HOR structure is predicted based on the start and end positions of
each monomer on the read. The repeat structure on the read is classified under
three categories regular, irregular(including inversion), or cases where no HOR
is detected. (b) An illustration of a read consisting of an array of alpha-satellite
monomers, which are identified from the HMM database. Each block arrow cor-
responds to a monomer. Similar colors indicate similar sequences. (c)
Identified monomers are clustered-based sequence similarity. Here, each clus-
ter is labeled by a different letter. (d) HOR structure is predicted based on the
start positions, end positions and the distances between monomers

groups based on pair—wise sequence identity using an implementa-
tion of an O(ND) alignment algorithm (Myers, 1986) within the
FALCON genome assembler (https://github.com/PacificBiosciences/
FALCON/). Cluster similarity threshold is determined per read by
evaluating a range of identity values (98% to 88% by 1% decre—
ments) and selecting the monomer clusters assignments with the
highest percent identity that permits inference of HOR organization.
Consensus sequence fasta and tab—delimited description of HOR
summary statistics are provided for each read.

2.2 Evaluation of regular or irregular repeat structures

HOR predictions for each read are classified as regular if cluster
order, as provided by monomer position—based indexing and similar-
ity clustering, follows a consistent pattern across the entirety of the
read. Let, X, be the start position of monomer in cluster X.
Additionally, let dX be an ordered set of distances between

monomers in cluster X, where dxd : X, + 1—Xi is the distance between
monomer i and i—l— 1 (Fig. 1c), and d is the superset of such distances
over all clusters. Conditions for regularity are listed below.

1. All identiﬁed monomers are assigned to a cluster containing
more than one monomer.

2. Distances between the monomers in the same cluster are consist—
ent across the read. Namely, 1.05 2 ch’i/MEDIANkl) Z 0.95.

3. Distance between the tail of each monomer and the head of the
adjacent monomer is equal or less than 5 bases.

4. Orientation of all monomers within the same cluster is consist—
ent, i.e. there are no inversions.

Reads that fail any of these conditions are considered irregular,
while reads failing condition 4 are additionally labeled as inversions.
Irregular reads contain rearrangements in monomer ordering (re-
gions of monomer insertion and deletion), shifts in orientation of
monomer repeat units, and/or stretches of bases that are interspersed
or are >5 bp at the start or end of monomers. HORs that contain
more than one copy of a certain monomer fail condition 2, and
therefore are currently characterized as an irregular. Monomeric sat—
ellite structures or highly divergent ordered arrays of monomers that
are expected to have single monomer membership in each cluster
group, are reported under the no—HOR category.

2.3 Evaluation of regular or irregular repeat structures
To evaluate alpha—CENTAURI, we characterized repeat structure
predictions using a test dataset of 6438 alpha satellite containing
reads (mean read length: 10,536 bp; min: 2000 bp; max: 31,594 bp)
from the hydatidiform mole genome (CHM1) (CHM1 error—cor—
rected sequences provided on the Alpha—Centuari git repository.).
Predicted repeat structures were compared to a reference database
of previously annotated HOR patterns (reviewed Alexandrov et al.,
2001) and using monomers obtained from the HuRef genome (Levy
et al., 2007; GRCh38 BioProject: PRJNA193213). A summary of re-
peat regularity is provided in Table 1.

We observed 23% (1470/6438) of alpha satellite containing
reads contained a regular HOR. Each regular read was assigned to
one of 49 previously characterized HORs, with representation
across all autosomes and the X chromosome (Supplementary Tables
S1 and 82). Within the regular predictions, subsets of reads were
observed to describe the same HOR, for example on the X chromo-
some (DXZl or ‘cenX’), 80 reads correctly identified the 12 mono—
mer HOR with a median monomer alignment identity of 98.9%.
We were are able to detect HORs that varied in monomer organiza-
tion within a single array or between nearly identical inter—chromo—
somal arrays, as seen in the dimeric repeat assigned to chromosome
1, 5 and 19 centromeric regions, where the majority of D1Z7
(or ‘cen1_1’) reads were characterized either as a dimer (66% of
reads, 143/218) or a 6—mer repeat (27% of reads, 60/218).

A summary of observed repeat regularity predictions using alpha satellite
containing reads from CHM1. This dataset is included with the Alpha-
CENTAURI source-code repository.

Initially, the majority of predictions were labeled as irregular.
After alpha satellite sequence annotation, it was determined that a
subset of irregular assignments were due to missing information:
events where HMMER did not correctly predict a monomer pos—
ition (44 reads, or 1.2% of irregular predictions); events where a
monomer length was less than the default threshold due to either re—
arrangement or incomplete HMMER monomer prediction (150 bp);
and events where the read length was insufficient to span the full
HOR more than once. Additionally, HORs that re—used near—identi—
cal monomers present within a single higher order repeat unit, as
observed for the D2121 HOR, were labeled as irregular. The re—
maining irregular reads are expected to represent ‘true’ HOR vari—
ants. These include inversions (154, or 4% of irregular reads, with
the highest prevalence on acrocentric array cen22, an HOR that is
found on both chromosomes 14 and 22) as well as rearrangements
of the HOR monomer patterns on the same read.

We observed 1244 alpha satellite containing reads that did not
provide evidence for an HOR. Roughly 44% (544/1244 reads) were
classified a ‘monomeric’ satellites, or highly divergent alpha satellite
monomers (i.e. monomers with less than the lower threshold of
88% pairwise identity) typically found in the pericentromeric arms.
The remaining 690 reads in our study either represented incomplete
HORs single copy HORs or included a transition into non—satellite
adjacent sequences (defined here as containing at least 1 kb of non-
alpha satellite sequence on the same read). Further analysis of these
transitions with RepeatMasker (http://www.repeatmasker.org),
using Repbase libraries (Jurka et al., 2005), demonstrates the ability
to track sites of transposable element insertion, of which we find
LINE1 to be the most prevalent (18.9% of total bases, i.e. 273 042/
1 393 472, surveyed from the 140 reads containing at least 1 kb of
non—alpha satellite sequence), consistent with the literature of alpha
satellite DNA (Schueler et al., 2001).

3 Conclusion

We present Alpha—CENTAURI, a python—based workflow for char-
acterizing satellite sequence variants in long read datasets. This
automated method is useful in reporting de novo higher order repeat
sequence organization and predicting structural variation within
HORs on a per read basis, thereby characterizing a window of local
repeat organization defined by the length of the read. Users are able
to rapidly characterize three distinct subgroups of repeat structure,
defined here as regular or irregular higher order repeats, thus defin—
ing HOR structures and sites of rearrangement.

While deep, long—read sequencing human datasets are becoming
increasingly available, one of the concerns with third—generation
sequencing approaches is their relative expensive compared to se—
cond—generation technologies at comparable sequence depths. Given
the high—copy number of HORs relative to the genome, one can pro—
vide highly-informative information of satellite structure at low—
depth (potentially even <1>< coverage of a genome). Therefore, we
believe Alpha—CENTAURI to provide an opportunity to not only
provide high—resolution surveys of HORs from deep sequencing pro—
jects, but also to enable low depth, low cost surveys across a popula—
tion or in genomes without high—quality references.

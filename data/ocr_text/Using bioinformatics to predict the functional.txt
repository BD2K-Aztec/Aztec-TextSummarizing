ABSTRACT

Motivation: The past decade has seen the introduction of fast and
relatively inexpensive methods to detect genetic variation across
the genome and exponential growth in the number of known
single nucleotide variants (SNVs). There is increasing interest in
bioinformatics approaches to identify variants that are functionally
important from millions of candidate variants. Here, we describe the
essential components of bionformatics tools that predict functional
SNVs

Results: Bioinformatics tools have great potential to identify
functional SNVs, but the black box nature of many tools can be
a pitfall for researchers. Understanding the underlying methods,
assumptions and biases of these tools is essential to their intelligent
application.

1 INTRODUCTION

The most common form of intra—species variation is the single
nucleotide variant (SNV) (Durbin et al., 2010). Recent sequencing
of whole human genomes has identiﬁed the number of SNVs in
each individual to be in the range of 3—5 million (Ahn et al.,
2009; Levy et al., 2007; Schuster et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008;
Wheeler et al., 2008). Common SNVs have recently been a focus
of population genetics and medical research. With the advent of
high—density SNV microarrays, researchers can do fast genome—wide
genotyping of study populations. This technology has been used
to trace the ancestry of modern humans and migration patterns of
ancient humans (Gutenkunst et al., 2009; Li et al., 2008). SNVs are
now the most commonly used markers in case—control association
studies. Genome—wide association studies (GWAS) have identiﬁed
over 3300 common SNVs with statistically signiﬁcant correlations to
disease phenotypes (http://www.genome.gov/gwastudies/ October
14, 2010). However, these correlations do not necessarily imply
causality, and researchers have found that most signiﬁcant SNVs
identiﬁed by GWAS do not contribute biologically to the disease
phenotype of interest (Cantor et al., 2010). While most SNVs
are likely to be functionally neutral (McClellan and King, 2010),
some SNVs have a functional impact and thus directly contribute
to disease susceptibilities and drug sensitivities. Discovering these

functional SNVs is one of the main goals of modern genetics and
genomics studies.

From a biological perspective, there are numerous ways that
a SNV can have a functional impact. A SNV may impact the
transcriptional machinery of a cell if it occurs in a region of DNA
that contains signals recognized by transcription factors and/or
transactivational enhancers. If it occurs at a splice site or a site
where exonic or intronic splicing enhancers or repressors bind, it
may result in alternative or aberrant splice isoforms of a transcribed
gene. It can interfere with the cell’s translational machinery. SNVs
that result in altered protein sequence may interfere with protein
folding, localization, stability, binding or catalysis.

Bioinformatics tools to identify important SNVs must consider
these possible impacts indirectly, through ‘proxies’. A bench
biologist interested in whether a SNV of interest impacts the
transcription of a gene might perform site—directed mutagenesis
on genomic DNA, transfect mutated DNA into cell culture and
use readouts of the gene’s transcriptional activity to measure
changes with respect to wild type. In contrast, a bioinformatics—
based approach typically involves computational analysis of the
DNA sequence surrounding the SNV, possibly supplemented with
information from published bench experiments. Does the DNA
contain motifs associated with binding of transcriptipon factors?
Can it be aligned to equivalent DNA sequence in other species?
Does statistical analysis of the alignment suggest that signatures of
evolutionary selective pressure are present in the region?

Most bioinformatics work on SNV function prediction has
focused on SNVs in protein—coding exons that change an amino
acid residue in the gene’s protein product. It has been argued that
these SNVs (known as cSNVs or nsSNVs) have the most relevance
to human health (B otstein and Risch, 2003), but growing knowledge
of the functional importance of non—coding DNA and RNA—coding
genes has brought this assumption into question (Altshuler et al.,
2008). Most SNVs found to be differentially distributed in cases
and controls at genome—wide signiﬁcance level in GWAS are not in
protein exons. In fact, most SNVs do not occur in protein—coding
regions. New methods are being developed to predict which of these
putative regulatory SNVs (known as rSNVs) may be consequential.
Undoubtedly, as scientiﬁc knowledge about functional regions in
mammalian and other genomes grows, our ability to enumerate and
predict the possible impacts of SNVs will grow as well.

2 CLASSICAL APPROACHES

The functional assessment of single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
prediction is a recent problem, yet some approaches have already

become mainstream. Technically speaking, a SNP has referred to
a point mutation having minor allele frequency greater than some
threshold (typically 1—5%), distinguishing them from rare variants.
There is a move in the genetics and cancer ﬁelds to use the broader
term SNV instead of SNP, which encompasses both common and
rare variation.

2.1 Impact of cSNVs

A cSNV can have negligible impact on normal protein activity or
interfere with normal activity in mild to severe fashion. In some
cases, cSNVs have major impact on genetic disease susceptibility
(sickle cell anemia), common disease risk (Alzheimers) and drug
sensitivities (warfarin) (McClellan and King, 2010).

2.1.] Properties of amino acid residue substitution To a ﬁrst
approximation, these effects can be predicted by properties of amino
acid substitution.

Many amino acid substitution metrics are based on estimates of
the expected evolutionary distance between each possible amino
acid pair. PAM matrices (Dayhoff and Schwartz, 1978) approximate
this distance according to the distribution of amino acids at
equivalent protein positions in closely related species. BLOSUM
matrices (Henikoff and Henikoff, 1992) include distantly related
species but only consider highly conserved protein regions. Both
approaches use the raw mutation rates to compute a score for each
amino acid substitution, which quantiﬁes the likelihood that it was
produced by an evolutionary trajectory over time rather than by
chance. The intuition is that substitutions that are more consistent
with evolutionary trends (conservative substitutions) are less likely
to be disruptive while substitutions that are less consistent with
evolution (non-conservative substitutions) are more likely to be
deleterious.

Another approach is to consider how amino acid biophysical
properties differ. Changes in volume, hydrophobicity, net charge,
packing density and solvent accessibility have been shown to
correlate with the functional impact of cSNVs (Wang and Moult,
2001).

The Grantham distance (Grantham, 1974) combines both
biophysical properties and evolutionary distance. Grantham
hypothesized that the biophysical importance of amino acid
substitution could be quantiﬁed in a 3D space, whose coordinate
axes are side chain composition, polarity and volume. Thus, each
amino acid substitution can be represented by a Euclidean distance
in this space (Supplementary Equation 1). To ascertain the relative
importance of these three properties, he parameterized Euclidean
distance by assigning a weight to each term. The weights were ﬁt to
amino acid substitution mutation rates as estimated by McLachlan
(1971).

While PAM and BLOSUM likelihood scores, changes in
biophysical properties and/or large Grantham distances may be
predictive of the impact of populations of SNVs, these metric are
not sufﬁcient to make accurate predictions about individual cSNVs
reliably (Karchin et al., 2005; Ng and Henikoff, 2001). For example,
a change from valine to isoleucine is conservative (positive), when
measured by the common PAM250 and BLOSUM62 matrices, has
no charge change and small Grantham distance. Yet, there are
valine to isoleucine cSNVs that have been shown to be deleterious
and clinically important. One instance is the SNV rs28928891, an

isoleucine to leucine change at codon 322 of HOXD 1 3, which causes
brachydactyly and results in very short ﬁngers and toes (Johnson
et al., 2003).

2.1.2 The evolutionary history of an amino acid position
BLOSUM and PAM scores estimate an evolutionary distance
separating a pair of amino acids. Ng and co—workers suggested
that the importance of this distance depends on the position where
an amino acid substitution occurs (Ng and Henikoff, 2001). For
example, arginine to cysteine substitution has a non—conservative
BLOSUM score, but this substitution should be treated differently
at a position invariant for arginine versus a position where arginine
and cysteine are both seen in protein family members.

The intuition behind considering the composition of amino acids
at equivalent positions in a protein family is that functionally or
structurally important positions will not tolerate a variety of amino
acids. Equivalent positions are identiﬁed by building a multiple
sequence alignment of related protein sequences and all residues that
occur in a column of the alignment are assumed to be at equivalent
positions. For example, if some alignment column consists entirely
of tryptophans, then these tryptophans may be required for the
members of the protein family to form a stable structure. During
the course of evolution, nucleotides in the tryptophan codon may
have been mutated, and organisms may have been born with other
amino acids at this position. If no such amino acid variant can be
observed today, then the tryptophan is important for the position, the
protein and organisms that use the protein in their cellular machinery.
This represents evidence of purifying evolutionary selection for
tryptophan. Thus, positions where there is high conservation are
likely to contain speciﬁc amino acid residues that are important for
normal protein activity.

A variety of scores have been designed to quantify this intuition.
One approach is to compute the frequency of the most common
amino acid in an alignment column. Alternatively, Shannon entropy
(Supplementary Equation 2) quantiﬁes how surprised we are by
the distribution of all amino acids in a column. Highly conserved
columns present few surprises while columns of little conservation
present more surprises (Schneider, 1997). Relative entropy reﬁnes
this concept by comparing Shannon entropy of a column with the
Shannon entropy of the amino acid background distribution.

Many scores incorporate both properties of amino acid
substitution and evolutionary conservation. The SIFT score
(Ng and Henikoff, 2003) is a weighted average of the frequency
with which a variant amino acid residue appears in the multiple
alignment column, and an estimate of unobserved frequencies via
Dirichlet mixture pseudocounts (Sjander et al., 1996). The PSIC
score (SunyaeV et al., 1999) considers the difference between the
likelihood of the reference and variant amino acid at an alignment
column, after encoding of the alignment in a position—speciﬁc
scoring matrix (PSSM) (Gribskov et al., 1987) (Supplementary
Methods). The AGVGD score (Tavtigian et al., 2006) is a position—
speciﬁc variant of the Grantham distance, where the Grantham
variation GV is computed by replacing each pair of components
representing composition, polarity and charge with the maximum
and minimum value in the alignment column. The Grantham
deviation measures the extent that a variant amino acid deviates
from the range of variation seen in the column, an estimate of its
Violation of evolutionary constraints on the protein position. The
MAPP score uses a statistical summary of an alignment column

SNV Function prediction

 

by constructing a phylogenetic tree and weighting each sequence
by tree topology and branch lengths (Stone and Sidow, 2005).
The mean and variance of amino acid physiochemical properties
in the summarized column are used to estimate position—speciﬁc
constraints on amino acid substitution in a biologically meaningful
way. Finally, a principal components analysis (PCA) transforms the
properties into decorrelated components, which are used to generate
an integrated score that measures constraint Violations with respect
to all of the amino acid properties.

2.1.3 Sequence—function relationships There are core bio—
informatics web services that contain information about sequence—
function relationships and these can be useful in assessing whether
a cSNV is functional. The best known is the UniProtKB database
(Bairoch et al., 2005), which maintains a feature table for each
curated protein sequence to annotate regions and speciﬁc positions
of interest, based on published studies. These features can be used to
identify whether a cSNV occurs at a location that may be particularly
sensitive to amino acid substitution, including DNA binding regions,
biologically important sequence motifs, active site residues, metal—
binding sites, sites of post—translational modiﬁcations and lipid—
binding sites. In some cases, the results of mutational functional
testing at a position are included as a feature, e. g. serine to alanine
substitution at codon 362 of TP53 is annotated as abolishing binding
to interaction partner USP7, as described in two referenced papers.

2.1.4 Structure—function relationships If a cSNV can be mapped
onto an experimentally determined protein structure or a high—
quality homology model, it is possible to compute a number
of properties that are useful in predicting its functional impact.
Solvent accessibility of an amino acid is one of the strongest
predictors of cSNVs with functional impact, as substitutions in the
hydrophobic core of soluble proteins can disrupt thermodynamic
stability. Structural modeling of mutant proteins can be used to assess
whether cSNVs induce backbone strain, lead to overpacking, occur
in cavities, or impact key pairwise residue interactions (Yue et al.,
2005). Many X—ray crystal structures have been co—crystallized with
interacting protein partners and/or small molecule, nucleotide and
peptide ligands. Thus, the ability to locate a cSNV on a protein
structure also makes it possible to assess, in some cases, whether
the change occurs at or near a binding or catalytic site or at a
domain—domain interface in a protein complex. Even in the absence
of co—crystallized structures, electrostatic analysis of the surface of a
protein structure or model can reveal highly charged patches whose
disruption by a cSNV may impact binding interactions.

2.2 Impact of rSNVs

A SNV can have regulatory impact in many ways, from disrupting
chromatin structure (McDaniell et al., 2010) to causing the loss
of a post—translational modiﬁcation site (Li et al., 2010). In many
cases, we do not understand the regulatory processes well enough to
predict if any given SNV will be consequential. Yet, there are areas
where even if our knowledge is incomplete, we are prepared to
make well—educated guesses. These areas include transcription, pre—
mRNA splicing, premature termination codons, microRNA binding
and post—translational modiﬁcation.

2.2.1 Transcription A SNV can interfere with regulation by
disrupting a transcription factor binding site. In the human genome,

most annotated transcription factor binding sites (TFBSs) are
derived through PSSMs, from sources such as TRANSFAC (Matys
et al., 2006) or JASPAR (Portales—Casamar et al., 2010). Each
PSSM describes a statistical proﬁle of the sequences bound by
a given transcription factor, according to experimental evidence
from sources such as ChIP—seq [reviewed in (Hudson and Snyder,
2006)]. PSSMs assume that each position is independent. While
questionable, this assumption allows researchers to estimate TFBS
proﬁles from limited sets of observations. Within a TFBS, some
positions may be highly conserved, reﬂecting that the transcription
factor requires a speciﬁc nucleotide for proper binding, while
other positions may be more divergent. This is captured by the
relative entropy of each column in the PSSM. A SNV that alters
a conserved position is more likely to be deleterious than one
that alters a divergent position. A number of transcription factors
also function as chromatin modiﬁcation factors, such as CTCF
(McDaniell et al., 2010). SNVs in such binding sites of such factors
can be especially consequential because of the potential to regulate
not simply individual genes but also larger regions of chromatin.
The gain or loss of a predicted TFBS might not be consequential,
for several reasons. First, PSSMs tend to be low speciﬁcity
predictors, because transcription factor binding motifs are short
and degenerate. De n0v0 TFBS searches for binding sites
tend to yield many hits with no clear regulatory role, and
consequently researchers often limit TFBS prediction to the
promoter region. However, recent experimental evidence indicates
that most transcription factor binding in humans is outside of
promoter regions [reviewed in (Farnham, 2009)]. Some of these
TFBSs may have no regulatory importance, which is another reason
why a TFBS gain or loss might not be consequential. Identifying
the important TFBSs is an open research question, but one clear
lesson has emerged: TFBSs are not likely to be occupied if they are
not in regions of open chromatin [reviewed in (Berger, 2007)]. The
ENCODE data in the UCSC Genome Browser details the regions of
open chromatin for many common cell types (Raney et al., 2010).

2.2.2 Pre-mRNA splicing SNVs that affect splicing tend to be
consequential. Of disease—associated single point mutations, an
estimated 15% are SNVs that alter splice sites in particular (Cartegni
et al., 2002; Krawczak et al., 1992), and an estimated 62% alter
splicing in general (Lopez—Bigas et al., 2005). SNVs can alter
splicing by disrupting an existing splice site, creating a de novo splice
site inside an exon, and adding or removing splicing regulatory
motifs such as exon—splicing enhancers (ESEs) and silencers (ESSs).
Misspliced mRNAs are often degraded with little or no translation
through nonsense—mediated decay;when translated to protein, they
often yield unstable proteins that perform no catalytic function
[reviewed in (Garcia—Blanco et al., 2004)]. SNVs in exons can
also introduce premature termination codons, which yield an mRNA
transcript that is tagged for nonsense—mediated decay and produces
little or no protein.

There are three categories of splice sites in the human genome.
Canonical splice sites are ﬂanked by the dinucleotides GT and
AG and represent more than 98% of human splice sites. Non-
can0nical splice sites are ﬂanked by the dinucleotides GC and
AG and represent approximately 0.5% of human splice sites. Non-
c0nsensus splice sites are ﬂanked with other dinucleotides, each
of which represents less than 0.05% of human splice sites. These
dinucleotides are contained within conserved motifs of eight to

twelve nucleotides in length. Canonical and non—canonical splice
sites can be recognized with high accuracy by PSSMs (Burset et al.,
2000). Non—consensus splice sites are not amenable to modeling,
due to their low frequency.

Any SNV close to a splice site has the potential to disrupt
splicing, and splice site analysis is a key component in SNV function
prediction. Common approaches include ﬂagging SNVs if they map
to one of the splice site dinucleotides, and assessing the impact of
SNV through PSSMs [reviewed in (Mooney et al., 2010)]. Methods
that limit analysis to the splice site dinucleotides will miss SNVs that
disrupt splicing at other conserved splice site positions. PSSMs are
effective at capturing the importance of each splice site position and
the likelihood of each nucleotide at each position. What they do not
capture is the interdependence between certain positions in the splice
site, where a SNV in one position is balanced by a compensatory
SNV in a second position. These positions are not always adjacent
(Yeo and Burge, 2004). Consequently, changes in PSSM score are
not always correlated with changes in splice site strength, especially
for splice sites that match the PSSM weakly.

Strong splice sites are necessary but not sufﬁcient for correct
splicing. Correct splicing also depends on exonic splicing regulatory
(ESR) motifs including ESEs and ESSs. Predicted ESEs represent
binding targets of SR proteins, a family of splicing enhancers and
experimental evidence has shown that motifs targeted by the SR
protein SFRS1 are enriched for disease—associated variants (Sanford
et al., 2009). Predicted ESSs represent targets of the hnRNP family
of splicing silencers. Both ESEs and ESSs are predicted according to
proﬁles of binding sites obtained through SELEX experiments (Klug
and Famulok, 1994). Some ESR predictors apply PSSMs estimated
from ESE or ESS binding site sequences. Others look for speciﬁc
short sequences that are enriched in observed binding sites, or are
overrepresented (in the case of ESEs) or underrepresented (in the
case of ESSs) in exons compared with introns or other non—spliced
sequences. To underscore their importance, ESEs cover roughly
half of all exonic nucleotides in the human genome [reviewed in
(Chasin, 2007)]. As this abundance might suggest, the gain or loss
of any single ESR is not necessarily consequential. The SNVs that
are more likely to alter splicing include those that introduce ESSs,
those that impact a larger number of ESRs (considering that one SNV
can impact several overlapping binding sites), and those in weakly
deﬁned exons with fewer ESEs and more ESSs (Woolfe et al.,
2010). The Skippy web server (http://research.nhgri.nih.gov/skippy)
estimates the likelihood that a SNV will affect splicing according to
these factors.

ESRs can also be found in intronic regions proximal to exons,
where they appear to have a regulatory role that depends on their
location relative to the exon and the splice sites. Besides ESEs
and ESSs, there are many intronic splicing regulatory enhancers,
especially in conserved regions proximal to alternative exons (Yeo
et al., 2007). Analysis of ISREs does not enter into many SNV
analysis pipelines yet, because most ISREs are not yet well—
characterized and the ISRE detection methods are still maturing.
Yet ISRE detection is an active research area, and will probably
become a component of SNV analysis in the future.

Finally, SNVs that introduce premature termination codons
(PTCs) have a high likelihood of being consequential. In mammals,
mRNA transcripts that contain termination codons (UAG, UAA or
UGA) more than about 50 nt upstream of the last splice site are
ﬂagged for nonsense—mediated decay. While there are exceptions,

these transcripts are generally decayed prematurely with little or no
translation [reviewed in (Holbrook et al., 2004)].

2.2.3 MicroRNA binding One more way in which SNVs can
impact regulation is by altering microRNA (miRNA) binding sites
[reviewed in (Mishra and Bertino, 2009)]. In animals, miRNAs
are short (21—25 nt) non—coding RNAs that regulate as many as
30% of all human genes (Lewis et al., 2005). miRNAs can
perform a diversity of functions but are most often implicated in
mRNA silencing through translational repression or mRNA cleavage
[reviewed in (Mattick and Makunin, 2005)]. They generally bind to
the 3’ UTR of target mRNAs. The overall binding may be weak, with
limited Watson—Crick base pairing, but strong binding at nucleotides
2—7 the 5’ end of the miRNA is Vital for proper target recognition.
This would suggest that SNVs in this seed region would have a
greater impact than SNVs elsewhere in the binding site, but the
situation is not quite that simple.

There is a spectrum of target sites. 5’ -d0minant seed sites
show perfect complementarity at the 5’ seed region but very poor
complementarity at the 3’ end, while 3’ compensatory sites balance
weaker pairing at the 5’ end (with seeds as small as 4—6 bp or 7—8 bp
with bulges) with stronger pairing at the 3’ end (Brennecke et al.,
2005). Stronger overall pairing is associated with stronger silencing.
Consequently, the impact of a SNV in a binding site depends on the
entire binding site.

Because miRNA targets are difﬁcult to determine experimentally,
most miRNA binding sites are predicted computationally. There are
now a variety of miRNA binding predictors [reviewed in (Raj ewsky,
2006)]. While details differ, all predictors share some fundamental
ideas. They all search conserved regions of the 3’ UTR of the mRNA
for regions of strong or perfect complementarity to the seed region
of the miRNA. Candidate matches are extended to longer, imperfect
matches, and the thermodynamic stability of the mRNA—miRNA
complex is evaluated. Some predictors consider additional features
to increase speciﬁcity, such as the solvent accessibility of the binding
site or clusters of putative binding sites in the same UTR. Yet, the
shortness and limited complementarity of the binding sites make
this prediction task difﬁcult at best, with an estimated speciﬁcity of
50% (Rajewsky, 2006). Different predictive methods tend to yield
contrasting sets of predictions, reﬂecting two things. First, when
evaluating a weak signal, even small algorithmic differences can
yield signiﬁcant contrasts in the output. Second, our knowledge
on miRNAs has been evolving rapidly, and different predictors
reﬂect different stages and aspects of this knowledge. For example,
a 3’ —compensatory target site might not be detected by a miRNA
target predictor, which requires a strong 5’ seed match. Thus, while
it might seem practical to increase prediction conﬁdence by applying
different miRNA binding site predictors to the same region and the
same SNV, such a strategy will not necessarily lead to a better
prediction.

2.2.4 Altering post-translational modiﬁcation sites The activity
of almost every eukaryotic protein is modulated through post—
translational modiﬁcation (PTM). There are many forms of PTM
[Uniprot currently lists over 400 (Bairoch et al., 2005)], including
many that are recently discovered [reviewed in (Witze et al., 2007)].
An estimated 5% of disease—associated mutations result in the loss
of a PTM site (Li et al., 2010), which is almost certainly an

SNV Function prediction

 

underestimate due to the many types of PTM sites that are not yet
well—characterized.

There are two ways of estimating large—scale PTM sites:
experimental measurement and prediction. Recent advances in mass
spectrometry proteomics have dramatically improved the ability to
detect PTM sites [reviewed in (Seo and Lee, 2004; Witze et al.,
2007)], but in spite of these advances, the vast majority of PTM
annotations in dbPTM (Lee et al., 2006) come from prediction. Yet
due to the diversity of PTMs, each form of PTM must be predicted by
a specialized predictor. Often, subsets of PTMs must be predicted
separately. For example, in mammals there are many families of
kinases, each of which bind to distinct sets of sequences, so kinase
binding prediction is best addressed with a cadre of predictors, each
of which predicts the binding of one speciﬁc kinase family [reviewed
in (Juncker et al., 2009)]. While this sort of specialization allows for
a more precise prediction, it also increases the risk of overestimation
as the number of training examples per example decreases (Blom
et al., 2004). Thus, when evaluating PTM site annotations, the onus
is on the researcher to understand how the prediction was derived
and the limitations of the method.

2.3 Bioinformatics predictors under the hood

2.3.1 Single versus multiple feature strategies While some cSNV
and rSNV function predictors rely on only a single feature, an
increasingly popular approach is to apply data integration strategies,
which combine multiple features into a single predictive score. If a
pair of features is highly correlated, there is probably not much
to gain by using both. However, features that are uncorrelated
or independent are expected to increase predictor accuracy when
combined. Thus, it makes sense to design a predictor by identifying
a set of highly informative and independent features.

To ascertain which features are useful, most researchers take an
empirical approach. Good features are those which can be applied
to discriminate between functional SNVs and neutral SNVs that
have no functional impact. Intelligent feature selection requires
that we have a collection of SNVs from both categories and that
the collection is representative of the variety of SNVs within both
categories. The assumption is that if the collection is large enough, it
will be sufﬁciently representative of this variety. Importantly, if this
collection is too small, not representative of the larger population of
functional and neutral SNVs, or contaminated by mislabeled SNVs,
we will not be able to ascertain whether selected features are useful.

2.3.2 Benchmark sets Researchers have used both functional
assay results and data—mining approaches to assemble collections of
functional and neutral SNVs. SNVs with known disease associations
are often used as the functional SNVs. Such SNVs can been
collected from curated databases such as SwissProt Variants (Yip
et al., 2004), OMIM (Hamosh et al., 2005), HGMD (Cooper et al.,
2006) or obtained from clinical or functional studies. Almost all of
these disease associations are with respect to Mendelian/monogenic
diseases. The SwissProt variants also include cSNVs with no disease
impact, which can be used as the neutral class. Alternatively,
researchers have used common, high—frequency SNVs [from
HapMap (Consortium, 2003)] as the neutral class (Schwarz et al.,
2010; Woolfe et al., 2010) or generated artiﬁcial cSNVs from the
equivalent amino acids in closely related species (SunyaeV et al.,
2001). Many early cSNV predictors took a different approach, and

used the results of saturation mutagenesis experiments in bacterial
and Viral proteins as benchmarks (Chasman and Adams, 2001;
Ng and Henikoff, 2001). For example, 4000 Escherichia coli lac
repressor amino acid substitution mutants had been tested for their
ability to repress B—galactosidase activity and respond to inducer,
with a colorimetric assay (Markiewicz et al., 1994). This yielded
a set of amino acid substitutions that had no impact on function
(neutrals) and a set of ‘functional’ substitutions that impaired
function. Finally, some researchers use all available information
about possible deleterious/neutral amino acid substitutions (human
disease databases, systematic functional assays of mutation in single
proteins) to construct large benchmark sets (Bromberg and Rost,
2007). Use of any of these benchmark sets assumes debatable cause—
and—effect relationships between SNVs and phenotypic effects. The
disease—based benchmarks assume a simple relationship between
SNV and phenotype, when the reality is likely more complex, with
the SNV as one contributing factor. The experimental benchmarks
implicitly assume that a measured impact on a single molecular
function is directly coupled with disease. Researchers should remain
aware of the underlying uncertainties inherent in these assumptions.

2.3.3 Supervised learning Perhaps the most data—driven
approach to SNV function prediction is to use a collection of
functional and neutral SNVs both to assess the most relevant
predictive features and to train a classiﬁcation algorithm. In
this case, the benchmark set is also used as a training set. The
most commonly used classiﬁers are supervised statistical learning
algorithms, in which each SNV is represented by multiple features
and a class label. These algorithms detect patterns associated with
each class and learn a decision rule, which is subsequently applied
to SNVs whose class membership is unknown. Examples of such
algorithms are classiﬁcation trees, support vector machines, random
forests, Bayesian networks and logistic regression [reviewed
in (Kotsiantis, 2007)]. Supervised learners are successful if the
decision rule yielded from the training phase is generalizable
or able to correctly predict the class membership of examples
(i.e. SNVs) that were not in the training set. Thus, they are
evaluated on estimates of generalization error, not on estimates
of misclassiﬁcation during the training phase. In practice, such
evaluations are done with cross-validation approaches, in which the
training set is randomly split into n partitions. The experiment is
repeated n times with each possible combination of n— 1 partitions
used for training and the remaining partition for testing.
Importantly, as with selection of predictive features, the relevance
of the decision rule yielded by a supervised learning algorithm
depends critically on the collection of SNVs used for training.

3 BUYER BEWARE

Researchers who would like to use bioinformatics methods to assess
SNVs of interest are faced with a wide range of possibly useful
methods. It makes sense to approach these methods with a critical
perspective to decide which, if any, is a good choice for your
particular purpose (Fig. 1).

Numerous bioinformatics SNV function predictors are available
Via web interfaces. These services are often easy to use, and it is
tempting to apply them as black boxes, without a solid understanding
of what they can and cannot deliver. This strategy is dangerous
from both a practical and scientiﬁc perspective. Before using a

Candidates for
functional or
clinical studies

Fig. 1. Flow chart for informed use of SNV function prediction tools. Black
box metaservers can be useful for narrowing down a large number of SNVs
to a tractable set. SNVs in coding regions may have regulatory impact and
should be assessed by both cSNV and rSNV tools. Once a tractable set of
SNVs is selected, tools should be carefully evaluated and used only if they
meet the criteria shown. After a tool is applied, users should be careful that
they both understand the tool’s output and can rationalize for themselves
why SNVs are predicted to be functional or not. Finally, results can be used
as candidates for planned clinical studies or functional testing.

web interface, we suggest that you study the underlying method(s)
carefully.

Any method offered by a web service should be the subject of one
or more peer—reviewed scientiﬁc publications. These publications
will explain the scientiﬁc assumptions made by the method, its
predictive features and algorithmic strategy, and assessment of its
performance, most often compared to the performance of similar
methods. They should also provide details about how predictive

features were calculated and the training/benchmark set that was
used for method assessment.

What does it mean when a publication claims that the SNV
function predictor designed by the authors performs well compared
to competing methods? The ﬁrst thing to consider is the data used to
develop the method, because this choice can bias the method in many
subtle ways. For example, some ESE predictors were developed
based on exons with weak splice sites, assuming that weak splice
sites are balanced by a greater density of splicing enhancers.
Arguably, these methods are biased toward alternative exons, which
tend to have weaker splice sites, and might not be effective at
evaluating SNVs in constitutive exons (Chasin, 2007). Similarly,
any method that uses protein sequence alignments to evaluate cSNVs
will be biased by the sequences that are included in the alignment.
Many methods use alignments of all available sequences in large
protein databases that can be inferred to have an evolutionary
relationship to the SNV—containing sequence. To effectively identify
biologically important conservation signals requires an appropriate
sample of both closely and distantly related sequences, which may
or may not be present in these databases for the sequence of
interest. The best distribution of phylogenetic distances within such
an alignment is not well understood. Yet, if the alignment contains
sequences that are too distantly related to the SNV—containing
sequence, it may contain residues that would be deleterious if
substituted into the equivalent positions in human. If it contains
only sequences that are too closely related to the SNV—containing
sequence, almost all positions will appear to be conserved, not
just those which are functionally important. Some methods use the
contrast in conservation between closely related sequences and more
distant homologs to identify important residues positions (Reva
et al., 2007), an approach which also requires good sampling of
related proteins. The SIFT alignment algorithm is designed to avoid
this pitfall by selecting a diverse set of homologs. However, even
this method is not foolproof. For example, if the protein sequence
database used to construct the alignment contains a large number of
paralogs from a particular species, SIFT’s output can still be biased
toward that species.

The next consideration is the statistic(s) used to measure SNV
function prediction performance. Statistics such as accuracy or error
are based on the fraction of misclassiﬁed example SNVs in the
benchmark set (which contains SNVs for whom the correct class is
presumably known). These statistics will yield overly optimistic (or
pessimistic) results if one class predominates in the benchmark set.
One can achieve 80% accuracy in a benchmark set that contains 80%
functional SNVs (the positive class), with a decision rule that always
predicts the positive class. Yet, this decision rule has no scientiﬁc
utility. Statistics that quantify the tradeoff between precision
(fraction of correctly identiﬁed positives with respect to all predicted
positives) and recall (fraction of correctly identiﬁed positives with
respect to all positives in the benchmark) (Buckland and Gey, 1994)
(e. g. the balanced F —measure) (Supplementary Equation 3) and the
Matthews correlation coefﬁcient (Supplementary Equation 4), are
more desirable. One of the best performance measures is the AUC
statistic (or area under the ROC curve), which is invariant to class
distribution (Fawcett and Flach, 2005).

However, these statistics only have meaning with respect to
the actual benchmark sets used. For example, to what extent
does prediction performance on a benchmark set of loss—of—
function versus neutral amino acid substitutions in a single bacterial

SNV Function prediction

 

protein generalize to its utility in predicting SNVs in a variety of
genes/proteins involved in complex human diseases? What if the
benchmark set consists of Mendelian disease mutations and common
SNVs? Does it make sense to combine results from functional assays
of proteins in yeast and/or cell culture with disease—associated SNVs
found in the literature? To our knowledge, these scientiﬁc questions
have not been tested. However, before using a method you should
understand the assumptions made by its choice of a benchmark set.

If a prediction method involves feature selection and/or
supervised machine learning, in 0rmati0n leak introduced during
testing may yield an overly optimistic evaluation of performance.
Accurate performance estimates require clean separation between
the examples used for feature selection, classiﬁer training, and
classiﬁer testing. Whenever an example is used for more than one of
these purposes, information leak may occur. Information leak may
also occur when there are dependencies between the examples used
in feature selection, training and testing. For example, the dataset
used to train and benchmark SNAP (Bromberg and Rost, 2007)
contains two amino acid substitutions at codon 180 of the T2E5
gene in E.c0li: alanine to glutamic acid (A180E) and alanine to
lysine (A180K). If this data was split randomly into feature selection,
training and test partitions, A180E might end up in the training
partition and A180K in the test partition, yielding information leak.
Before accepting the prediction performance claimed by authors
of a method, you should look at its training/benchmark set and
understand how this set was split up to assess performance.

Another problem involves implicit bias when comparing
competing prediction algorithms. Unbiased comparison requires
that both algorithms be trained and/or benchmarked on the same
dataset. Before accepting claims of superior performance to a
competing method, always check and see whether a method’s
authors assess themselves on examples used for training and
how cross—validation was performed. Was the competing method
originally trained/assessed on a different set of examples, but now
evaluated with respect to the authors’ training/benchmark set? In all
fairness, the authors may have had no practical alternative but to
take this approach. However, it calls into question claims that one
method is superior to others.

Ideally, a user will download the software that implements a
method, rather than use the web site, for a whitebox approach.
Descriptions of a method in the literature may contain errors.

4 CONCLUSION

In an age of personal genomics, SNV prioritization has become
essential. This task can now be facilitated by SNV meta-servers
(Fig. 1), which are essentially black boxes to automate execution of
multiple assessments, one for each of the many factors that can lead
to a functional SNV. However, anyone who uses black box SNV
assessment tools should understand how the assessments are made,
and what their limitations are.

One limitation shared by all of the prediction methods described
in this review is that prediction relies on knowledge, and our
knowledge is incomplete. For example, current ESS predictors
are based on only one family of splicing factors (hnRNP family
proteins), but there is no reason to believe that these proteins
represent the complete universe of ESSs. Happily, our knowledge is
likely to expand thanks to new technologies. ChIP—seq technology
represents a signiﬁcant advance in evaluating the impact of SNVs

on DNA binding, because there is no requirement of knowing the
precise binding sequences in advance. This technology will facilitate
research on the impact of SNVs on DNA methylation, chromatin and
transcription factor binding, and RNA processing (through CLIP—
seq). Additionally, the task of SNV assessment is likely to beneﬁt
from research currently underway on assessing the consequence
of gains or losses of TFBSs, predicting ISREs, and further
characterizing microRNA binding. Chromosomal segmentation may
soon offer new insights on the medical relevance of intergenic
SNVs, by distinguishing active intergenic chromatin from large—
scale repressed chromatin (Ernst and Kellis, 2010). A community—
wide effort CAGI (critical assessment of genomic Interpretation)
has been created to compare analytical methods to assess genomic
variation through blind prediction, modeled after the CASP contests
and should provide excellent information on what types of methods
are effective in practice (http://genomecommons.org/cagi/).

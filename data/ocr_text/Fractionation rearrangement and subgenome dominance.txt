ABSTRACT

Motivation: Fractionation is arguably the greatest cause of gene
order disruption following whole genome duplication, causing
severe biases in chromosome rearrangement-based estimates of
evolutionary divergence.

Results: We show how to correct for this bias almost entirely
by means of a ‘consolidation’ algorithm for detecting and suitably
transforming identifiable regions of fractionation. We characterize
the process of fractionation and the performance of the algorithm
through realistic simulations. We apply our method to a number of
core eudicot genomes, we and by studying the fractionation regions
detected, are able to address topical issues in polyploid evolution.
Availability and implementation: Code for the consolidation
algorithm, and sample data, is available at: http://137.122.149.195/

1 INTRODUCTION

Fractionation (Langham et al., 2004), the loss of duplicate genes
after whole genome duplication (WGD), causes more gene order
disruption than classical chromosomal rearrangements such as
inversion or reciprocal translocation. WGD and fractionation are
particularly prevalent in ﬂowering plants (Soltis et al., 2009), where
the cycle of the two processes also involves the constant excision
of excess non—coding DNA (Eckard, 2001; Freeling et al., 2012),
a major difference between these organisms and other evolutionary
domains, such as the mammals.

Gene order disruption follows from the partly random choice of
which of the two copies is deleted, i.e. which of two homeologous
chromosomes retains the remaining single copy of the gene. This
process was ﬁrst hypothesized by Wolfe and Shields in their 1997
demonstration of the ancient WGD of Saccharomyces cerevisiae
(Wolfe and Shields, 1997), suggesting ‘... this is the result of
random deletion of individual duplicated genes from one or other
chromosome subsequent to the initial duplication of the whole
region’. This loss pattern was further highlighted years later by the
comparison of the S. cerevisiae gene order with that of related diploid
yeasts by Dietrich et al. (2004) and Kellis et al. (2004), who called it
‘interleaving’, while Freeling was coining the usage ‘fractionation’
in the context of plant genomics.

When a number of adjacent duplicate pairs lose a group of
their redundant genes from one homeolog and another group from
the other homeolog, as in Figure 1, methods for inferring the
rearrangement distances between the WGD descendant T (referred
to as an ‘ancient tetraploid’ despite being a present—day genome,
long since re—diploidized) and an unduplicated sister genome D
automatically infer that there are rearrangement breakpoints where

adjacency no longer exists between the two groups of single—
copy survivors. This artiﬁcially inﬂates the inferred number of
reciprocal translocations and greatly exaggerates the overall amount
of chromosomal rearrangement between the two sister genomes.
The ﬁrst goal of our work is to be able to computationally
detect, characterize and correct for this impediment to the study
of evolution.

Key to our method is the identiﬁcation and isolation of
‘fractionation intervals’, regions in both the ancient tetraploid and its
sister diploid that have become entirely single copy and may or may
not have been rearranged internally but have (so far) been unaffected
by rearrangements exchanging genes from within the interval and
genes external to the interval. The second goal of our work is to
inventory these regions across the two genomes to that they can be
studied quantitatively. The statistical properties of the intervals bear
on current topics of interest in plant evolutionary genomics, whether
duplicated genes are silenced or deleted one by one or through
the deletion of longer stretches of DNA, whether a fractionation
regions tends to lose genes largely from one of the homeologous
chromosomal segments or equally from the two and on the question
of subgenome dominance, i.e. whether any such bias toward one
homeolog persists from the original WGD event and is unaffected
by chromosome shufﬂing.

2 METHODS
2.1 Methodological preamble

In this article, we focus on the evolutionary divergence of a genome
after WGD compared with a related diploid. The mathematics of genome
comparison at the level of gene order or conserved synteny blocks is well
worked out [reviewed in (Fertin et al., 1974)] when the two genomes have
identical complements of single—copy genes only, but the problem is more
difﬁcult when they have different gene complements or genes that occur two
or more times in a genome. There are many approaches to the comparison of
genomes with duplicates, as reviewed in (El—Mabrouk and Sankoff, 2012).
These range from ‘guided genome halving’ where single—copy genes may
simply be excluded from ancient tetraploid (Zheng et al., 2008) or included
in an ad hoc way (Sankoff et 01., 2009), through ‘duplication—loss’ models

Fractionation and rearrangement

 

where the ordering of loss and duplication events is the focus (Marron et al.,
2004), to the ‘exemplar method’ where it is the duplicate genes that are
excluded or rather reduced to single—copy status in an optimal way before
the comparison and everything in between (Sankoff, 1999). Although all
of these are well motivated in particular contexts, they all invoke objective
functions that are largely irrelevant to fractionation.

The central datum in genome comparison algorithms is generally the ‘gene
adjacency’. Ideally, the genes are oriented, i.e. their 5’— and 3’—ends are
distinguished, and when we speak of two genes being adjacent, we mean
that the 3’—end of one is adjacent to the 5’—end of the next one, if they are on
the same DNA strand or that their two 5’—ends (or two 3’—ends) are adjacent
if they are on complementary strands. An adjacency is thus deﬁned by two
speciﬁc gene ends and not by two genes.

Decomposing a genome into its adj acencies, to take advantage of genome
comparison algorithms, loses no information in the case of diploid genomes
if all genes are present in only one copy, since then the genome is completely
determined by its adjacencies. This equivalence between genomes and sets of
adjacencies may break down when duplicate genes occur in large numbers.
Nevertheless, in this article, we will use the adjacencies directly to bypass the
arbitrary use of objective functions and other assumptions inherent in most
comparison algorithms. In particular, it will be appropriate in the WGD—
fractionation context to simply compare the sets of adjacencies that occur at
least once in a genome as the relevant representation of that genome.

2.2 Excess adjacencies as a measure of rearrangement

As a doubled genome evolves through genome rearrangement and/or
fractionation, there is a direct effect on the inventory of oriented gene
adjacencies. Initially, a new tetraploid and an unduplicated sister genome
will have the exact same adjacencies, although these will have multiplicity
2 in the tetraploid. Over time, rearrangement will change the adjacencies in
the diploid, without appreciably changing the total number of adjacencies.
(This number can change only as a result of the rare events of chromosomal
ﬁssion or fusion, whereas it does not change after the more frequent events
of inversion or reciprocal translocation.) At the same time, in the tetraploid,
both rearrangement and fractionation will add new adjacencies without
necessarily losing the original ones, since an evolutionary event need only
affect one gene copy or one homeolog at a time, leaving the other intact.
Thus, the total number of different adjacencies in the diploid and the ancient
tetraploid T, in excess of the number in the diploid D alone, measures the
degree of evolutionary divergence.

We carried out simulations of the schema in Figure 2 to quantify the
effect of rearrangement on the number of adjacencies, involving random
chromosomal inversions and reciprocal translocations in the proportions
10:1. The simulations modeled a diploid with 24 000 genes randomly
divided among 20 chromosomes. The two breakpoints of each rearrangement
were chosen at random on the same chromosome for inversions, and on
two randomly chosen chromosomes, for translocations. A separate series
of simulations modeled the inversions as short (random inversion length
drawn from a geometric distribution, with mean length of ﬁve genes) and
unrestricted, with two random end points, in the proportion 20:1. The
differences in the results between the two kinds of model were negligible in
all analyses in this article, including the one in Section 4.4 later.

All simulations were run 20 times, and their average values were plotted.
Because of the large number of genes in the simulations, variability among
the replicates would be almost imperceptible on the scale of the diagrams to
be presented here.

Figure 3 shows the tight linear relationship between the number of
rearrangements simulated r, sampled at r=600,1200,m, (g to form the
ancient tetraploid T and g to form the modern diploid D) and the increase
in the number of adjacencies, when the number of deletions d is zero.

Although we can invent examples where the number of adjacencies and
the number of rearrangements are less predictive of each other, these would
be encountered with negligible frequency in real data or in simulations. In the

ensuing sections, therefore, we will use the number of excess adjacencies as
a proxy for the amount of rearrangement.

2.3 The effects of fractionation on adjacencies

We carried out extensive simulation experiments to assess how the process
of fractionation impacts the apparent amount of rearrangement. The genes
deleted to form the ancient tetraploid were chosen entirely at random from
the entire genome, under the constraint that once a gene was deleted, its
duplicate could not be deleted in a later step. The solid lines in Figure 4 show
the effect of increasing amounts of fractionation on the apparent amount of
rearrangement, a gross distortion.

3 ALGORITHM

We developed the consolidation algorithm to assess and correct for
this distortion. This focuses on detecting and accounting for two
homeologous regions of single—copy genes in the ancient tetraploid
which contain no genes in common (as the genes concerned are
single copy) but whose combined [or consolidated (Langham et al.,
2004)] gene content is exactly the same as some contiguous region
in the diploid. We call maximal regions like this Class 1 regions,
in contrast to Class 2 regions, where there is only one region in
the tetraploid which contains only, and exactly, the same single—
copy genes as a region in the ancient tetraploid, but where there is
sometimes clear adjacency evidence of where the duplicate copies

Fig. 5. Arrow indicates positioning of third (empty) fractionation interval
for genes 6,7 and 8, on the evidence of the positioning of these three genes
between 5 and 9 in the diploid and on one homeologous chromosome

of these genes were deleted, as in Figure 5. Classes 1 and 2 exhaust
all the single—copy genes in the ancient tetraploid. The algorithm for
detecting and listing these regions runs in linear time in the number
of genes. Once the regions are identiﬁed, the three components of
a Class 1 region are replaced by a new, labelled, dummy gene.
Similarly, for the two components of a Class 2 region, with a third
copy of the dummy gene placed whenever possible according to the
afore—mentioned adjacency evidence.

The two genomes, thus reduced by the replacement of single—
copy genes by a lesser number of dummy genes, is then examined
for excess adjacencies.

Note that the genes in this discussion are all oriented, i.e. their 5’—
and 3 ’ —ends are distinguished, and when we speak of two genes being
adjacent, we mean that the 3’—end of one is adjacent to the 5’—end of
the next one, if they are on the same DNA strand or that their two
5’—ends (or two 3’—ends) are adjacent if they are on complementary
strands. An adjacency is thus deﬁned by two speciﬁc gene ends
and not by two genes. Nevertheless, in the ensuing discussion, we
may sometimes speak of adjacent genes without introducing any
ambiguity.

3.1 Consolidation algorithm
Input: Triple (L,D, T), where

0 L is a set of genes.

0 D is a diploid genome, i.e. L is partitioned among a number
of chromosomes; the genes on a chromosome are ordered.

0 T is an ‘ancient’ tetraploid, i.e. each gene of L occurs in either
one or two copies; the genes are partitioned and ordered on a
number of chromosomes, with no constraint on positions of
two copies of the same gene.

' For each gene 8 6L, pointers [C1 (80,191 (g), C2(g),p2(g),
C3(g),p3 (g)] indicate its chromosomal membership and its
position in that chromosome’s order. The subscript ‘1’ refers
to D and ‘2’ and ‘3’ refer to the occurrences of g in T, where
C3(g) =p3 (g) = 0 if g occurs only once in T.

Output: Triple (L’ ,D’ , T’), where

0 D’ is a diploid genome with gene set L’, and T’ is a ‘pure’
tetraploid (all genes occur exactly twice) on L’ .

0 L’ =L2ULV. L2 gL is the set of genes with two copies in
T, and LV is a set of ‘virtual’ genes, each one representing a
triple of intervals of genes (in L), (11,12,13), the ﬁrst, 11, on
a chromosome in D, the second and third on chromosomes
in T, such that 12 (113 :0, 12U13 :11. The 11 from different
virtual genes are disjoint, and their union is L\L2, the entire
set of single—copy genes in T. Moreover, the elements of LV
are jointly maximal in that the union of no two of them can
be a virtual gene.

Detect fractionation intervals

While there are still single—copy genes in T that have not been placed
intervals, create new element of LV as follows:

- Initialize empty intervals 11,12 and 13. Find the ﬁrst single—
copy (in T) gene in D, add it to 11 and 12.

0 While the next gene in D is a single—copy (in T) gene on the
same chromosome as the other genes in 11 and it is on the
same chromosome as 12 or 13, add it to 11 and to 12 or 13. If
it is not on the same chromosome as 12, and I3 is empty until
the present time, the gene determines on which chromosome
the interval 13 is to be located.

0 While the genes in 12 (or 13) are not contiguous, remove the
last gene assigned to 11 and 12 or 13.

0 If 13 75 0, the virtual gene g representing the triple (11,12,13)
is added to LV, and it replaces the genes in 11 on D, and the
genes in 12 and 13 on T.

Else (if 13 = 0),

- place 13

Consider the two genes (actually gene ends) a and 6 adjacent
on the left and right of 11 in D and the two genes 19 and d

adjacent on the left and right of 12 in T. Locate all further
copies of 61,19, 6 and d in T, and insert 13, or the virtual gene
representing 13 into T adjacent to one, or between two, of
these gene ends, in such a way as to minimize the number of
new adjacencies thus created. This involves trying all eight
combinations or orientations for the virtual genes in its three
locations

0 Now the virtual gene g representing the triple (11,12,13) can
be added to LV, replacing the genes in 11 on D, and the genes
in 12 and 13 on T.

0 There are minor details, which we will omit, on handling
‘telomeric’, i.e. at the ends of chromosomes, genes.

Note that place 13 contains an optimization step. The rest of the
algorithm is deterministic, and it may very well not call place 13 at
all. Nevertheless, the consolidation algorithm may be reformulated
as a combinatorial optimization problem, where the objective is to
minimize the number of different adjacencies by ‘placing’ all the
empty I3 intervals at the same time.

The consolidation algorithm, as presented, has quadratic worst
case running time, in the number of genes, but in practice, on large
genomes both real and simulated, it takes seconds or minutes. Other
consolidation algorithms, with linear worst case running time, have
been devised by J. Kovac (personal communication) and K. Jahn
(personal communication).

The consolidation algorithm treats the fractionation intervals as
identical units, one in the diploid and two in the tetraploid. In
this way, it accounts not only for rearrangements which includes a
whole interval in its scope but also for rearrangements which disrupt
an interval, in that a fractionation involving such an interval will
generally be automatically counted as two intervals, resulting in two
virtual units instead of one. What the consolidation algorithm does
not account for, however, are rearrangements occurring completely
within one of the fractionation intervals.

To correct for this, within each fractionation regions, we ﬁrst
consider all the adjacencies in 11 and compare each 12 and, if
necessary, 13, with 11. For the comparison, with 12, for example we
delete the genes in 11 not in 12. We count only those a2 adjacencies
in 12 not in the reduced 11. We add the number of these ‘rearranged’
adj acencies to the set of adjacencies produced by the consolidation
algorithm.

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
4.1 Applying the algorithm to simulated genomes

As can be seen in Figure 6, for moderate rearrangement distances,
and for a wide range of fractionation rates, our procedure almost
completely wipes out the distortion caused by the fractionation.

4.2 The study of fractionation regions

The consolidation algorithm was motivated as a way of correcting
estimates of genomic divergence, but an important byproduct is its
systematic identiﬁcation of fractionation regions. This will be the
focus of the remainder of this article, including its empirical aspect.
First, we will explore fractionation regions in the contexts of our
simulations and in the next section, discuss how to analyze this
process in the core eudicots.

4.3 Why can not we just ignore fractionation regions?

The consolidation algorithm adapts genomic rearrangement
assessment to the case of mixed duplicate and single—copy genes,
through the device of virtual genes representing fractionation
regions. We may ask, what if we just delete all single—copy genes
and compare the diploid sister genome with whatever duplicates
remain in the ancient tetraploid? This question is motivated by the
original approach (since abandoned) to the ‘guided genome halving’
problem (Zheng et al., 2007).

The results, shown in Figure 7, show that this alternative approach
is not a satisfactory way of handling single—copy genes, considering
its substantial underestimate of the amount of rearrangement, which
is especially severe when the fractionation process is far advanced.

4.4 Rearrangements and fractionation region size

When only a few of the homeologous gene pairs have been reduced
to single copy, fractionation regions will tend to be small and
dispersed across the genome. Most rearrangements will not change
the contents of any fractionation region. When most of the gene pairs
have been reduced to single copy, fractionation regions will tend to
be longer, especially if there have been few rearrangements. Then
each new rearrangement is likely to disrupt a fractionation region,
usually breaking it into two. These tendencies can be seen in Figure
8, where the fractionation regions for a genome with 15 000 out
of 24 000 gene pairs reduced to single copies, are little affected
by rearrangements. Where 21000 of the pairs are thus reduced,
the size of the fractionation regions is much more sensitive to
rearrangements.

4.5 Fractionation in the poplar genome

In applying our method to the genome of poplar (Populus
trichocarpa) (Tuskan et al., 2006), an ancient tetraploid, compared
with diploid sister genomes, grapevine (Vitis vinifera) (Jaillon
et al., 2007) and cacao (Theobroma cacao)1 (Argout et al., 2011),
we discovered that the large majority, 70—90%, of the apparent
rearrangements are actually attributable to fractionation. We also
carried out matching simulations, with the same number of duplicate
and single—copy genes, produced by random paralog deletion and
a number of random rearrangements, mostly inversions, to produce
the same number of excess adj acencies. Examining the consolidated
regions detected by our algorithm, there are a number of regions
much longer than those in the simulations (Fig. 9), suggesting a non—
independence of deletion events affecting neighboring genes and
clear tendency for genes to be deleted in one of the two homeologs,
as would be predicted by the recent theory of sub genome dominance
(Schnable et al., 2011): ‘Genes are disproportionately lost from one
parental subgenome, the subgenome that is less expressed in the
polyploid’.

 

1Data were drawn from CoGe (Lyons and Freeling, 2008; Lyons et al., 2008)
and processed using the SynMap procedure, with a 2:1 syntenic depth setting
to account for the ancient tetraploidy of poplar, and minimum syntenic block
length 2 (to avoid the excessive noise with minimum size 1 but capturing
more orthologies than with higher minimum sizes).

4.6 Effect of deletion event run size

Motivated by the discrepancy between the poplar genome
fractionation region sizes and the results of the simulations, we ran
new simulations where instead of choosing duplicate genes to delete
one at a time at random, we deleted one or more contiguous genes at
a time, starting at a random position in the genome, according to a
geometric distribution with mean ,u.. To model the quantitative bias
in the fractionation process, successive genes were deleted from the
same homeolog with ‘continuation’ probability p Z % and from the
opposing homeolog with probability 1—p.

To infer the best values of the parameters ,u.,p and the r number
of rearrangements to account for the poplar—Vitis and poplar—cacao
comparison, we simulated the evolutionary process with a ﬁxed
number of genes in the diploid and tetraploid and a ﬁxed number
of single—copy genes in the tetraploid. We searched in a three—
dimensional grid where ,u. e [1 , 2] ,p e [0.5, 1.0] and r takes on a wide
range of values depending on ,u., for the values of the parameters
that could produce the same number of adj acencies before and after
the consolidation algorithm and the same number of fractionation
regions as the real data. The results for

0 The real genomes,
0 A model where one gene is deleted at a time (,u. = 1,19: 1),

0 The best model with geometrically distributed deletion
lengths,

' A model with ,u. = 2,

are compared in Table 1.

The results from the two diploids are similar with respect to ,u.,
namely 1.7 and 1.8, but the p are rather different: 0.5 for Vitis and
0.7 for cacao. The most important fact is that in taking into account
the sizes of the fractionation regions in the simulations requires us
to increase the number of rearrangements substantially, by 50% in
the case of Vitis and by over 100% for the cacao comparison.

As we built no provision into the simulations for fractionation to
affect the two homeologs differently there is no reason to expect
the kind of fractionation bias we observed in poplar to show up
in the simulations. Indeed, Figure 10 shows that simulations with

Number of genes in fractionation intervals

Fig. 10. Discrepancy in two Populus intervals in the number of genes,
compared with random simulations. In Populus regions, the single—copy
genes are concentrated in one of the two homeologous intervals. Jagged
nature of graphs due not to statistical ﬂuctuation but to measurement of
discrepancy from an ‘even’ split, which is necessarily calculated slightly
differently for even and odd totals of genes in the fractionation intervals.
Black dashed line represents simulations with deletion event run size
geometrically distributed with mean 1.7

or without deletion event run size variability do not differ. This is
further conﬁrmation of the reality of the observed effect that it is
not an artifact of duplicate deletion regime nor of the consolidation
algorithm.

4.7 Single-copy region syntenies with cacao and Vitis

Since the cacao and Vitis genomes have a long history of independent
rearrangements, we can expect that fractionation regions induced by
the consolidation algorithm by one of them in poplar will generally
differ from the regions determined by the other. Nevertheless, we
found many regions in the Vitis—poplar comparison that overlapped
substantially in poplar with regions in the cacao—poplar comparison.
In particular, we found eight regions that contained more than

15 genes in both comparisons; six of these pairs of comparisons
had more than 15 genes in common; of most interest is that the
common genes were 100% on only one homeolog in seven of the
eight cases. This strongly suggests that there is a functional reason
for these large sets of contiguous genes to be reduced to single—copy
and for these copies to be retained on a single homeolog.

4.8 Subgenome dominance

Although we have detected and measured substantial bias in the
fractionation of ancient core eudicot tetraploids, without a gene—
by—gene reconstruction of the ancestral chromosomes, we cannot
as yet be sure that the bias is systematically in favor of one or
other of the diploids contributing to the original polyploid. This
dominance of one of the subgenomes has been demonstrated in the
case of maize (Schnable et al., 2011), where it was also correlated
to gene expression, patterns which persisted despite a number
of genome rearrangement events disrupting the original synteny
relations among genes.

5 DISCUSSION

An analytically advantageous feature of our analysis is that it
partitions the rearrangements that have affected a tetraploid into
those that have operated within a fractionation interval and those
that have left these intervals intact, either because the intervals are
outside the scope of the rearrangement or the interval is affected as
a whole, without any effect internally. Of course, in the the history
of the tetraploid there will have been some rearrangements that have
involved elements both within and outside fractionation intervals,
but these are rendered irrelevant and invisible to our analysis because
their effect is simply to fragment the intervals into two or more new
intervals and hence perpetuate the within—outside partitioning of the
rearrangements.

One of the problems remaining with this work is the large number
of genes that do not appear in any synteny block in the diploid—
tetraploid analysis of pairs of core eudicot genomes. This despite
reducing the minimum block length as low as 2 in SynMap. Some
of this is undoubtedly due to genes absent from one of the genomes,
but much of it will be due to movement of genes out of their erstwhile
homeologous contexts, by various processes (Wicker et al., 2010;
Woodhouse et al., 2011).

In our simulations of geometric deletion events, we ‘marked’ some
duplicate genes for deletion before carrying out the rearrangement
step, and only actually deleted them afterward. This was for purposes
of comparability of the results with the previous simulations where
deletions followed rearrangements. Our goal in this marking was
to allow a degree of switching between homeologous chromosomes
during the deletion event, and no connection was assumed between
two different events. However, this computational device could also
be used to model subgenome dominance, by using two different p—
values one for the dominant subgenome and a smaller value for
the other subgenome. Marking becomes analogous to (lack of)
methylation or to other epigenetic regulatory mechanism that can
persist despite extensive genome rearrangement.

It will be of interest to explore the extensions of our treatment
of fractionation to genomes descending from more complex
polyploidization events than WGD. The plant genomes studied here,
as well as all the other core eudicots, descend from an ancestral

hexaploidization event (J aillon et al., 2007). Extensive fractionation
has left only a hundred or so triplicates intact and about a thousand
duplicates, in Vitis and in cacao (Zheng et al., 2012). Many core
eudicot angiosperm genomes have been sequenced but as of yet no
sequence of a dicot that diverged before the hexaploidization event
has been published, so that extensions of our procedure could be
tested.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Information concerning the gene expression pattern
in four dimensions (species, genes, anatomy and developmental
stage) is crucial for unraveling the roles of genes through time.
There are a variety of anatomical gene expression databases, but
extracting information from them can be hampered by their diversity
and heterogeneity.

Results: aGEM 3.1 (anatomic Gene Expression Mapping) addresses
the issues of diversity and heterogeneity of anatomical gene
expression databases by integrating six mouse gene expression
resources (EMAGE, GXD, GENSAT, Allen Brain Atlas data
base, EUREXPRESS and BioGPS) and three human gene
expression databases (HUDSEN, Human Protein Atlas and BioGPS).
Furthermore, aGEM 3.1 provides new cross analysis tools to bridge
these resources.

Availability and implementation: aGEM 3.1 can be queried using
gene and anatomical structure. Output information is presented in a
friendly format, allowing the user to display expression maps and
correlation matrices for a gene or structure during development.
An in-depth study of a specific developmental stage is also
possible using heatmaps that relate gene expression with anatomical
components. http://agem.cnb.csic.es

1 INTRODUCTION

Different genes are expressed in various tissues at different
developmental stages. Knowledge concerning the precise spatial—
temporal transcript abundances of genes during development of an
organism in normal as well as in diseased states provides a valuable
tool for understanding the mechanisms underlying the susceptibility
to complex disease.

should be regarded as joint First Authors.

Traditionally, gene expression has been measured using DNA
microarrays and in situ techniques. DNA microarrays allow
differential transcript levels for several genes to be measured
at once (expression proﬁling), but information obtained from in
situ gene expression is required for a detailed anatomical and
histological snapshot of the identiﬁed genes (de Boer et al., 2009).
The constant increase in data and data concerning data (metadata),
both from microarrays and in situ techniques, require organization
into specialized databases. Currently, a number of diverse databases
exist containing information generated using microarray techniques
(ArrayExpress, Brazma et al., 2003; NCBI GEO, Barrett et al., 2011;
Gene Expression Atlas, Wu et al., 2009) and in situ techniques
(EMAGE, Richardson et al., 2010; GXD, Finger et al., 2011).
It has become relatively common for databases to provide in situ
information for the implementation of new methods that allow such
data to become accessible to the user in a spatial—temporal way. For
example, such tools allow a user to select an anatomical location
by interacting with interfaces that present sections of the organism
under study at the chosen developmental stage. The combination of
a gene expression data base and a spatial—temporal device to retrieve
information has been named a ‘gene expression atlas’. Atlases for
the most relevant model species have been built including ZFIN for
zebraﬁsh (Sprague et al. 2006), BDGP (Tomancak et al., 2007) and
FlyBase (Grumbling and Strelets, 2006) for Drosophila, MEPD for
medaka (Henrich et al., 2005), EMAGE (Richardson et al., 2010)
and GXD (Finger et al., 2011) for mouse, and HUDSEN (Kerwin
et al., 2010) and ArrayExpress Atlas for human (Lukk et al., 2010).

Having well—structured gene expression information relating to
model organisms organized into dedicated databases, it is necessary
to integrate and make this diverse set of information accessible
in a harmonized manner. Several initiatives have emerged that
investigate the possible correlation of global patterns among
orthologous genes from different species (Lu et al., 2009; Ravasi
et al., 2010), some of them including Web Platforms. However,
problems related to the proper handling of developmental stage
information and anatomy mapping are still pending. Therefore,
gene expression blending from various organisms requires a
speciﬁc integration effort at three levels: orthologous genes
ﬁnding, developmental stage mapping and anatomy mapping.
The ﬁrst level evolved alongside sequencing initiatives. However,
the requirements for the second and third levels have recently
been identiﬁed, with efforts oriented toward combining data from

various organisms. Let us consider, as examples, the approach
followed by two mature databases, 4DXpress (Haundry et al.,
2007) and XSPAN (Luger et al., 2004). They represent two
partial solutions, in that 4DXpress tackles the issue of gene
expression data blending, whereas XSPAN addresses the issue
of anatomical ontology mapping, with no synergy between these
approaches. Indeed, XSPAN faces the issue of linking tissues in the
anatomical ontologies of the main model species (human, mouse,
Drosophila and Caenorhabditis elegans) without taking advantage
of ontology mapping to combine information from an organism’s
devoted gene expression resources. However, in 2008 4DXpress
contained in situ hybridization data from >16 000 genes from four
organisms (Drosophila, Medaka, zebraﬁsh and mouse). Its main
drawback is that integration has been reached exclusively using gene
orthology, and there has been no anatomical mapping among various
organisms.

To build aGEMv3. l, a developmental stage and anatomy mapping
have been carried out. Moreover, aGEM merges gene expression
information from various organisms using different technologies:
in situ techniques and microarrays. Microarray data for human and
mouse is derived from the BioGPS data base (Wu et al., 2009),
whereas in situ experiments are stored in HUDSEN (Kerwin et al.,
2010) and Human Protein Atlas (Uhlen et al., 2010) for human
and EMAGE (Richardson et al., 2010), GXD (Finger et al., 2011),
GENSAT (Sayers et al., 2011), EUREXPRESS (Diez—Roux et al.,
2011) and ABA (Jones et al., 2009) for mouse. The information
displayed in aGEM 3.1 is presented in an intuitive manner, allowing
the complementation of relatively scarce data on humans with mouse
data.

Currently, aGEM provides a friendly and intuitive display of gene
expression information for >1450 000 and 278 000 gene—structure
pairs for mouse and human, respectively. To our knowledge, aGEM
is the ﬁrst tool integrating data from two different experimental
techniques: microarrays and in situ experiments. Therefore, the
aGEM Platform is in demand for cross—species meta—analysis, and
is currently in use by >200 external users who have actively
contributed to its development and testing since the ﬁrst release in
2009. Future releases will concentrate on incorporating more human
expression resources, as the number of human gene—structure pairs
is somewhat limited.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

The integration process described in the previous section demanded
extensive analysis of anatomical gene expression data resources in
order to map the information into a tailored—made aGEM integrative
data model, combining information concerning genes, anatomical
structures and developmental stages. For genes, MGI and ENSEMBL
identiﬁers were used as the standard for mouse and human, respectively.
Orthology mapping was taken from Mouse Genome Informatics

(http://www.informatics.jax.org/reports/homologymap/mouse_human.shtml).

In this cross—species framework, anatomical structures were integrated in
three steps. First, a representative ontology for each organism was chosen
(standard—like ontology) and anatomical terms from remaining ontologies
were mapped to them. In this study, the EMAP ontologies for mouse embryo
[from Theiler stage (TS) l to 26] and MA ontology for adult (TS28)
were considered to be the standard—like ontology for mouse, while eVOC
ontologies [from Carnegie Stage (CS) 1 to 20, plus adult] were the standard—
like ontology for human. Secondly, anatomical vocabularies from BioGPS—
mouse, ABA and GENSAT databases were aligned with terms from EMAP

by Kruger et al.

and MA ontologies for mouse. EUREXPRESS database was populated
using EMAP ontology, and therefore no alignment was necessary. Similarly,
human vocabularies from HUDSEN, Human Protein Atlas and BioGPS were
mapped with eVOC—human ontology. Once all integrated mouse databases
use the EMAP and MA language and human databases use the eVOC—human
language, the third step consists of identifying homologies among terms from
the two standard—like ontologies. This has enabled the mouse and human
gene expression information to be integrated. The choice of eVOC—human
ontology as the standard for human was intentional as a trade—off between
a much desired mapping simplicity at the expense of a somehow limited
spatial resolution, and allows us to take advantage of EMAP/eVOC—mouse
and eVOC—mouse/eVOC—human mappings provided by Kruger et al. (Fig. l
and Supplementary Material). These mappings have allowed gene expression
to be integrated across species, in that correspondence among mouse and
human terms is established by eVOC—mouse terms having a total of 1460
mouse—human common structures.

The alignment process was accomplished by a pattern matching script to
ﬁnd equal terms, and then one—to—one comparisons were performed for the
non—automatically matched terms. This manual mapping process provided
a list of analogues, or alternatively, terms similar to those of the chosen
ontology. Analogue terms are deﬁned as ways of referring to the same
anatomical entity. For instance, cerebrum (ABA vocabulary) is analogous
to telencephalon (EMAP/MA ontologies). When no analogue terms were
identiﬁed, matching was achieved by similarity. In the case of the mouse,
speciﬁc vocabularies of the central nervous system (as ABA and GENSAT)
describe ﬁner details than the chosen standard ontology (EMAP and MA).
In such cases, these terms were mapped to the corresponding general EMAP
and MA terms. However, although three kinds of relationships have been
identiﬁed during the mapping process (equal, analogue and similar) no
differences have been made among them during the internal aGEM 3.1
working.

The same procedure was applied for human, where BioGPS—human,
Human Protein Atlas and HUDSEN databases were mapped to eVOC—human
ontology.

EMAP ontology was developed in the framework of the Edinburgh
Mouse Atlas Project (a partnership between the MRC Human Genetics
Unit at Edinburgh University and the Jackson Laboratories, USA), and it is
presented as a hierarchy of anatomical terms for each developmental stage,
displaying the structural relationships between the anatomical entities within
each stage and during development (Baldock and Davidson, 2008). Jackson
Laboratories further extended the existing EMAP ontologies to the Mouse
Adult ontology (MA, http://www.informatics.jax.org/searches/AMA_form
.shtml; Hayamizu et al., 2005) corresponding to TS28.

eVOC was developed by the South African National Bioinformatics
Institute (http://bioportal.bioontology.org/ontologies/44302/?p=terms; note:

and comprises orthogonal controlled vocabularies for mouse and human
(eVOC ontologies; Kelso et al., 2003), providing powerful means for
comparisons between these two model organisms. eVOC ontologies are
simpliﬁed representations describing the temporal and spatial distribution
of developmental human and mouse anatomies (Kruger et al., 2007).

Time is important in anatomy, and relationships between time windows
(developmental stages) are crucial in this integrative Platform. aGEM uses
human and mouse stage mapping provided by Jonathan Bard (Table 1).

Information concerning gene orthology, anatomical and stage mapping
has been stored and is accessed through a Perl library developed at the
Biocomputing Unit (Supplementary Material).

Release 2.0 of aGEM was entirely devoted to mouse (Jime’nez—Lozano
et al., 2009). However, one of the most relevant features of the current 3.1
release is the existence of human gene expression information (HUDSEN
data base for CS12—23, BioGPS and Human Protein Atlas for adult) that,
together with the new ‘Cross Module’, allows cross—species analysis to
be carried out by comparing the gene expression information from these
two organisms intuitively. Moreover, new functionalities have been added
including heatmaps and cluster maps, and the capability to download them.

3 ALGORITHM

Information extracted from the integrated databases has been
organized following a simple aGEM tailor—made data model. aGEM
consists of 11 tables; nine correspond to the nine integrated human
and mouse databases (EMAGE, GXD, GENSAT, ABA, BioGPS
mouse, EUREXPRESS, BioGPS human, HUDSEN and Human
Protein Atlas) and two (named mouse and human core tables) contain
all gene—structure pairs with corresponding statistical information
collected from the individual tables. Last aGEM complete database
update was carried out on July 2011, and it is regularly updated at
least once per year.

Diversity in source databases is at the ontology/vocabulary level
and at the gene expression annotation level. Each data base refers
to the strength of gene expression in a non—numerical way, with

the exception of BioGPS. To compute statistical information from
the databases, heterogeneity of gene expression annotations in the
various databases had to be addressed. For integration purposes,
expression levels from source databases were summarized in three
levels, ranging from 0 (low expression) to 2 (high expression).
aGEM can be queried by gene/s or anatomical structure/s. Retrieved
statistical information is displayed in four ways: expression maps,
correlation matrices, hierarchical clusters and heatmaps. The ﬁrst
three modes are displayed independently of the ﬁxed parameters
(gene, structure or developmental stage). However, heatmaps are
computed only when a developmental stage is chosen.

To compute expression maps, the more frequent value from
the core tables for each gene—structure pair is extracted. In other
words, the ﬁnal expression value retrieved for each developmental
stage corresponds to the value obtained most often among tables.
Correlation among genes in a structure or among structures for
a given gene is computed using the Kendal tau rank correlation
coefﬁcient.

Hierarchy of gene clusters or anatomical structure clusters is
addressed using aGEMv3.l by means of an R module. Hierarchical
clusters constitute an intuitive way to display relationships among
genes expressed in a chosen structure or among structures where
a gene is expressed. Heatmaps describe the expression pattern
in the chosen developmental stage. Heatmaps are accompanied
by a gene cluster and a structure cluster. To avoid grouping
into clusters of gene—structure pairs where the expression is
unknown, just genes with known expression in at least 50% of
the structures and structures where there is available expression
data for more than 50% genes are considered in the heatmaps.
The idea behind this rule is avoiding to group genes and structures
with no information among them. Due to differences between
human and mouse ontologies, there is a lack of synchronization
between human and mouse heatmaps. Therefore, to ease users in the
process of human and mouse comparisons, an additional feature that
applies the aforementioned ﬁltering process to mouse and human
simultaneously has been implemented. The results are synchronized
mouse and human heatmaps.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The architecture of the Platform is based on Perl modules that query,
retrieve and process information from an MySQL data base (DBI
Perl). Javascript issues the dynamic web display and R generates
heatmaps and hierarchical clusters.

Queries to the aGEM Platform are translated into SQL queries,
mouse and human MySQL core tables are retrieved, and results are
organized by three Perl modules (one for mouse, one for human
and a third one for cross) and displayed in a tab arrangement using
J avascript. The contents in each tab are organized into tables (Fig. 2)
that link to information on annotations and expression maps that are
launched on the ﬂy by Perl modules.

aGEM 3.1 can be queried by gene and anatomical structure. The
ﬁrst type of query can be carried out by using the ENSEMBL
identiﬁer, common gene symbol, MGI identiﬁer or UniProt
accession number. Querying by anatomical structure is simpliﬁed by
displaying the terms from the chosen developmental stage (Carnegie
Stage for human or Theiler Stage for mouse) in hierarchical trees.

By integrating the KEGG pathways data base in aGEMv3.l,
the user can query using a set of genes involved in a given

process. This utility is very useful as it allows gene expression
differences and similarities to be compared in physiological and
disease states. Emphasizing the disease state, information from
OMIM (human diseases) and MTB (tumours in mice) databases
is displayed associated with genes in the results interface, when
available.

Whether the user queries by gene or structure, the output
information is presented in a format that allows the user to identify
the experiments from which gene expression information has been
inferred. The system also displays expression maps and correlation
matrices for a gene or structure during development. Heatmaps
and hierarchical cluster representations provided by aGEM allow
in—depth study of the expression proﬁle for a speciﬁc developmental
stage, and this information can be downloaded in text format.

Navigation through the Platform is eased by the documentation
and help sections, where the user can access a manual and tutorial
describing all the outputs in depth, together with the answers to the
most frequently asked questions. Furthermore, additional examples
concerning mouse and human are located in the main query page.

Independently of the chosen species for the query (mouse or
human), the system will display information from the organisms
separately (Mouse Data tab and Human Data tab), and display cross
information (Cross Data tab). To calculate co—expression among
genes, aGEM takes into account the variable space (anatomical

structure) and the variable time (developmental stage). Cross—
species meta—analysis can be divided into two types: co—expression
meta—analysis and expression meta—analysis. Co—expression meta—
analysis calculates whether genes co—expressed in one species are
co—expressed in another (Lu et al., 2009), and aGEM3.l allows the
user to identify if genes co—expressed in mouse are co—expressed in
human during development by selecting a given anatomical structure
in the Cross Data section. Analysis of similarity between expression
proﬁles of homologous genes in various species (expression meta—
analysis) is gathered for each common developmental stage by
selecting the ‘Cross Map’ or the ‘Cross Heatmap’ options.

5 DISCUSSION

The usefulness of aGEM is discussed using a speciﬁc example
related to a well—known pathology, illustrating in this way the type
of analyses that aGEM provides.

Huntington’s disease (HD) is a rare neurodegenerative disorder of
the central nervous system characterized by abnormal movements,
behavioural and psychiatric disturbances, and dementia.

A set of 41 genes related to HD extracted from Ingenuity and
Panther databases have used as input for aGEMv3.l (Table 2).
Heatmaps for mouse at TS28 and human adult have been obtained
and analysed by using the option of synchronization, where
expression information regarding non—common human and mouse
anatomic structures has been removed (Fig. 3). Synchronized
heatmaps show gene expression information for a total of 22
common human and mouse structures (Table 3) and 14 genes. No—
synchronized heatmaps can be found in the Supplementary Material.
Each position in the heatmap represents the expression strength of
a gene in a speciﬁc structure. Heatmaps are especially valuable
in that they allow for an intuitive clustering representation of the
variable depicted in them. Consequently, in our heatmaps the clusters

be seen, as an example, that Casp8 and Caspl2 genes have similar
expression patterns in the studied structures, both for human and for
mouse, as an illustration of anatomical structure clustering, cerebral
cortex and cerebellum belong to the same family in the structure
cluster in mouse as well as in human.

Close examination of the synchronized mouse and human
heatmaps obtained from the aGEM Platform (Fig. 3) shows
expression in three anatomical structures belonging to the central
nervous system: cerebral cortex, cerebellum and hippocampus,
belonging the two ﬁrsts to the same cluster. However, the pattern of
gene expression observed in the heatmaps is not restricted to central
nervous system structures; for example, expression can be observed
in the endocrine system (e. g. pancreas, adrenal gland, thyroid,
placenta); exocrine system (salivary gland); haemolymphoid system
(bone marrow and lymph node); reproductive system (ovary,
uterus, testis); digestive system (stomach, small intestine); renal
system (kidney); skeletal muscle; cardiovascular system (heart); and
respiratory system (lung) (Fig. 3). While some of these structures
have a clear role in some HD—associated pathologies (weight loss,
heart failure, skeletal muscle wasting, pneumonia, impaired glucose
tolerance and testicular atrophy), others could not be clearly related.

Cross heatmaps provided by aGEM display the global patterns of
tissue—speciﬁc expression of orthologous genes, allowing matches
or mismatches between patterns in human and mouse to be easily
identiﬁed (Fig. 4). In this case, the colors in the heatmap do not
denote expression strength, but differences in this variable between
mouse and human: green means same expression for mouse and
human, blue implies a high expression in mouse than in human
and red indicates a high expression in human than in mouse. As
an illustration, HIP] gene expression is clearly greater in human
than in mouse in all the common structures excepting salivary
gland. As it was commented before, the structure and gene clusters
summarize the heatmap information by highlighting set of structures
or genes with similar expression difference patterns between mouse
and human. In the example shown, differences in the expression of
PACSIN] and CLTC genes are well conserved between mouse and
human for the studied set of anatomical structures.

The example presented here aims to give the user an outlook
of the expression patterns in the different anatomical locations for a
concrete set of input genes related with a given pathological process.
The same procedure could be employed with any other set of genes
involved in any pathological or physiological process. Indeed, HD
was used in this article only as a test case to attract user’s attention
on the usefulness and applicability of aGEM3.l. The test case does
not intend to provide the basis for the demonstration of a concrete
hypothesis, but to guide users in the kind of analyses that can be
carried out with the described Platform. Therefore, we encourage
researchers to launch aGEM with the set of genes they are working
on. Hopefully, aGEM will highlight some common features among
these genes that could be very helpful in the context of their scientiﬁc
researching.

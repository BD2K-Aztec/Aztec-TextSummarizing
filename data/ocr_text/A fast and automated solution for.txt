ABSTRACT

Motivation: Accurate prediction of the domain content and
arrangement in multi-domain proteins (which make up >65% of
the large-scale protein databases) provides a valuable tool for
function prediction, comparative genomics and studies of molecular
evolution. However, scanning a multi-domain protein against a
database of domain sequence profiles can often produce conflicting
and overlapping matches. We have developed a novel method that
employs heaviest weighted clique-finding (HCF), which we show
significantly outperforms standard published approaches based on
successively assigning the best non-overlapping match (Best Match
Cascade, BMC).

Results: We created benchmark data set of structural domain
assignments in the CATH database and a corresponding set of
Hidden Markov Model-based domain predictions. Using these,
we demonstrate that by considering all possible combinations
of matches using the HCF approach, we achieve much higher
prediction accuracy than the standard BMC method. We also show
that it is essential to allow overlapping domain matches to a
query in order to identify correct domain assignments. Furthermore,
we introduce a straightforward and effective protocol for resolving
any overlapping assignments, and producing a single set of non-
overlapping predicted domains.

Availability and implementation: The new approach will be used
to determine MDAs for UniProt and Ensembl, and made available
via the Gene3D website: http://gene3d.biochem.uc|.ac.uk/Gene3D/.

1 INTRODUCTION

An active ﬁeld of bioinformatics pursues the identiﬁcation and
classiﬁcation of protein domain families. This is critical to
our understanding of how proteins evolve new functions and
how domain family content can explain phenotypic variation
between organisms. From an annotation perspective, newly

sequence genomes can be scanned against libraries of domain
families in order to predict the function of novel genes (Schug
et al., 2002). However, due to both the huge number of sequences
in the protein databases, and also the large number of domain
families, it is essential to use fast robust sequence analysis and
comparison techniques. Furthermore, unless manual validation is
used when building proﬁles of families, a given query sequence can
generate many conﬂicting and overlapping matches. These are the
result of complex structural rearrangements and gene fusion events
that have occurred throughout evolutionary history. Resources such
as InterPro and Pfam (Finn et al., 2008; Hunter et al., 2009)
apply extensive curation of their family models and the resulting
predictions. In contrast, fully automated protocols remain useful in
helping identify novel families that are then fed into the manual
curation pipelines, rather than directly used for biological analyses
(i.e. Pfam—B, ADDA and CHOP; Heger and Holm, 2003; Liu and
Rest, 2005). However, using manual veriﬁcation is very expensive
and time consuming, and will become increasingly so in the era of
high throughput sequencing.

Gene3D (Yeats et al., 2008), a member of the InterPro consortium,
provides domain annotations based on the CATH structural domain
classiﬁcation (Cuff et al., 2009). CATH provides a manually
validated set of domains derived from structures in the PDB (Berman
et al., 2003), and these domains are grouped into superfamilies
where there is evidence of common evolutionary ancestry from
shared sequence, structural and functional features. Gene3D uses
a similar approach to the SUPERFAMILY resource (Wilson et al.,
2009), which is based on the SCOP structural classiﬁcation
(Andreeva et al., 2008). A set of structural representatives are
chosen from each superfamily in CATH and used to seed an
automatic iterative search process (SAM Target—2K; Karplus et al.,
2003). The resulting multiple sequence alignment is then converted
into a Hidden Markov Model (HMM). Each superfamily may be
represented by more than one model, with an average of four
per superfamily. These models are then used to identify probable
homologous domains in protein sequences, and the resulting
predictions merged into a ﬁnal set of assignments. Gene3D aims
to provide high quality structural domain annotations for the
major genome and protein sequence databases, including Ensembl
(Hubbard et al., 2009), UniProt (UniProt Consortium, 2009) and
RefSeq (Pruitt et al., 2007)—see Supplementary Data for example
genome coverage.

The annotation pipeline for determining a multi—domain
architecture of a given query sequence (Fig. 1) can be considered to
consist of three main steps:

(1) Generate a HMM model library to represent structural
domains in CATH.

Fig. 1. Domain homologue identiﬁcation. The mapping of structural
superfamilies from the PDB to their homologues in sequence databases
currently takes four steps. (la) First, a representative set of homologues
is gathered using the SAM Target T2K procedure to create a large seed
alignment. (lb) These are used to generate a library of HMMs with the
Hmmer software, which (2) are used to search sequence databases (for full
list see Gene3D website). (3) The matches produced by the searches are then
assembled into a non—redundant architecture and displayed on the website.

(2) Scan the query against the model library using HMM—
sequence search software (e. g. HMMER2).

(3) Resolve signiﬁcant model matches into a prediction of the
domain boundaries and superfamily content for the query
sequence.

Step three (referred to as the DomainFinder or ‘DF’ step) at ﬁrst
appears straight—forward, but in reality a query sequence can match
many models with high signiﬁcance, producing a set of conﬂicting
predictions of domain boundaries and superfamily assignments (for
types of overlaps, see Fig. 2). This issue is more trivial for single
domain proteins where one can simply take the match with the
best score (e. g. E—value or alignment score), but for multi—domain
proteins there can be hundreds or thousands of putative predictions.
Multi—domain proteins are believed to make up more than two—thirds
of known proteins (Ekman et al., 2005), with some consisting of
more than 10 domains. Dealing with these cases is a high priority
for resources such as Gene3D.

Another cause of complexity comes from the existence of
structural domains that are discontinuous in sequence. This situation
arises when one domain is inserted into another, splitting the original
domain into multiple sequence segments. Around 20% of
domains in CATH, distributed across 15% of superfamilies, are
considered to be discontinuous (Redfern et al., 2007), which means
these cases must be accounted for in order to maximise annotation
coverage of the genomes. We employ a simple heuristic that
identiﬁes long inserts within the alignment of the HMM to the
sequence, splitting the match into multiple segments and permitting
other domains to be assigned into the gap (see Fig. 2).

Our previous method (DF2) for resolving HMM model matches
into a uniﬁed multi—domain architecture (MDA) for protein
sequences was both intuitive and simple—we will subsequently
refer to this as the ‘Best Match Cascade’ (BMC) protocol. It also
only allowed a single residue overlap between different matches,
primarily due to the complexities of resolving discontinuous

show the types of overlap for matches (grey boxes) to a sequence (plain black

overlaps. In both the cases we wish to choose whether the overlap is allowed
(and hence both matches may co—occur in the ﬁnal MDA) or disallowed
(one or the other or none may occur in the ﬁnal MDA). Terminal overlaps
may be due to two closely proximal domains with imprecise boundary
assignments [A(i)], or two related models suggesting different boundaries
for the same domain [A(ii)]. We set an overlap length threshold to segregate
the two types. Embedded overlaps can be caused by inserted domains
[B(ii)] or contrasting predictions [see B(i)]. (C) Discontinuous and embedded
domains, are frequently identiﬁed by CATH. To identify such cases, the
alignment of the match to the model is examined and long insert regions
(>30 residues) are excised. This results in domains that are made up of more
than one discrete segment (gaps indicated by dotted line). Resulting terminal
overlaps are resolved as for single segment domains [i.e. C(ii)], while any
remaining embedded overlaps are considered ‘disallowed’ overlaps [C(iii)].

domains, and a risk of including false positives. However, after
examining the performance of this method with a novel benchmark
measure, we discovered a signiﬁcant proportion of missing domains
in our resolved predictions, despite the fact that signiﬁcant matches
to these domains were identiﬁed by the HMM scanning process.
As a consequence, we developed a novel approach that represents
sets of potential matches as weighted graphs, and uses the Cliquer
(Ostergard, 2002) heaviest clique—ﬁnding (HCF) algorithm to assign
the most probable MDA to a given sequence. The underlying
hypothesis of the approach is that the combination of matches that
produces the highest combined score is the most likely to accurately
represent the MDA.

We demonstrate here that this HCF algorithm performs better
in all benchmarks than the BMC approach. We also show that
to account for the inaccuracies of boundary prediction from
automatically generated HMMs, it is essential to allow MDAs
where the matches overlap on the query sequence. To remove these
overlaps, we have implemented a simple, yet accurate, resolution
protocol to predict domain boundaries once the optimal set of
domain assignments is determined. By improving both aspects of our
previous DF2 algorithm, we show that we can achieve a very high
degree of accuracy on our benchmarks, and that this performance
translates to a substantial increase in domain annotations for
sequences in UniProt and Ensembl. While developed for multi—
domain architecture prediction by Gene3D, our new algorithm
(DF3) can be applied to other sets of overlapping predictions to
determine a minimal representative set, such as other domain family
resources or template selection for structural modelling.

Resolving protein domain architectures

 

2 METHODS

2.1 Creating CATH domain predictions

We searched the PDB benchmark, UniProt and Ensembl sequence
data sets using the CATH v3.2.0 superfamily representative HMM
library and hmmpfam (Hmmer 2.3.2g, default settings and a per—match
E—value limit of 0.001). The CATH HMM library consists of 8871
HMMs for 2178 superfamilies. The library can be downloaded
from http://release.cathdb.info/v3.2.0/hmmer.lib.gz; for details of their
construction see Sillitoe et al. (2005).

2.2 Pre-processing of CATH HMM matches

The alignments of all model—sequence alignments with an E —value < 0.001
were examined for gapped regions (i.e. insertions) longer than 30 residues.
These were taken to indicate that the domain is likely to be discontinuous in
the query sequence. This may be caused either by natural variation or due to
errors in the protein sequence. In these cases, the match is split into multiple
segments. For instance, if the model aligns to residues 1—200 in the query
sequence but contains a 50—residue insert between positions 70 and 119, we
create a single domain prediction with two segments: 1—69 and 120—200.

2.3 Selecting the optimal domain prediction
The BMC and HCF algorithms described below are summarised in Figure 3.

Fig. 3. The match selection methods. (a) A hypothetical dataset. Each
HMM match is indicated in order along the sequence (x—axis), with more
signiﬁcant matches lower on the y—axis, and each identiﬁed by a roman
numeral. The shading indicates the superfamily assignment (homology
group). Dotted lines join matches that signiﬁcantly overlap with each
other. (b) The BMC process. The most signiﬁcant match is selected, and
signiﬁcantly overlapping matches removed. This step is repeated until no
matches remain, producing the ﬁnal MDA of three domains (i—iv—vii).
(c) The HCF process: (i) Matches are assembled into single—linked clusters
of signiﬁcantly overlapping matches. Each cluster is then formed into a
weighted graph by making matches nodes, and drawing edges between nodes
that do not overlap. Nodes are weighted by the signiﬁcance of the match
(node size in the ﬁgure, large is more signiﬁcant). (ii) The Cliquer algorithm
is used to identify the heaviest true cliques in each set (highlighted) and
the MDA assembled from the selected matches. This approach yields an
MDA of ﬁve domains in this instance (i—iii—v—vi—viii). By selecting the
less signiﬁcant but shorter matches, a combination with a greater overall
signiﬁcance is found.

2.3.1 BMC All signiﬁcant (E < 0.001) matches to a given query sequence
are assembled into a list, ordered by E —value. The top match is assigned to the
query and then the list traversed until the next highest non—overlapping (by
more than a given number of residues) match is found and this assignment is
added. Matches that overlap (above a threshold value) with any previously
selected one are ignored. The process continues until the list has been
traversed and all matches are either added to the MDA or discarded.

2.3.2 HCF Three steps underpin this approach. Firstly, the matches are
assembled into ‘chains’ of overlapping domains; two matches are linked
into a chain if they overlap by more than the assigned threshold (dotted lines
in Fig. 3a), and each chain resolved independently [boxes in Fig. 3c(i)].
This initial step essentially splits the problem of ﬁnding the optimal match
combination into subsets, minimising the search space. Secondly, each subset
of matches is then formed into a weighted graph by considering each match
to be a node, weighted by the —log(E—value), and drawing edges between
matches that do not overlap by more than the assigned threshold; i.e. if they
are both allowed to appear in the ﬁnal MDA assignment. Thirdly, the Cliquer
algorithm (Ostergard, 2002) is then used to identify the maximally weighted
clique in the graph, which is the combination of assignments that gives
the highest total score. The ﬁnal MDA is then calculated by combining the
optimal sub—graphs (i.e. solutions) from each subset. Overlapping matches,
within the allowed threshold, may still exist at this point. These are resolved
using the procedure described in section 2.4.

2.4 Dealing with overlapping domain matches

2.4.1 Optimising allowed match overlap Two types of ‘allowed overlap’
threshold were tested—using a maximum percentage overlap and a
maximum ﬁxed length overlap. For the ﬁxed length thresholds, matches
are considered as having an allowable overlap, and hence treated as ‘non—
overlapping’ for determining the MDA, when the following criteria is met:
if the overlap is less than n amino acids in length (0 < n < 40 tested; n = 30
used where not otherwise indicated), and the overlap comprises <50% of the
match. For the percentage thresholds an overlap was allowed if it was less
than n% of the length of the shortest match (0—50% tested). The performance
of both approaches was comparable, so most analyses were carried out only
using the ﬁxed length threshold.

2.4.2 Resolving overlapping matches to produce non-overlapping
predictions Once the optimal set of domain assignments has been found
(either by BMC or HCF), it is necessary to resolve any overlapping
matches to provide a single non—overlapping MDA and thus the ﬁnal domain
boundaries for the query. In each case one of the following approaches is
used, as appropriate. (i) If a segment of a discontinuous domain is entirely
embedded within another match then the segment is removed. (ii) Otherwise
the overlap is a straightforward partial overlap, and the overlapping segment
divided equally between the two domains; if the segment is an odd number
of residues the extra residue is given to the C—terminal domain (see
Supplementary Data for a graphical description).

2.5 Creating benchmarks

2.5.1 CATH benchmark data The sequences of all chains in the PDB
for which every domain had been classiﬁed to a superfamin in CATH were
retrieved along with the associated location of each domain—a total of 75 655
chains. However, this dataset is highly redundant at the sequence level, due
to the composition of the PDB. Using CD—HIT with default settings and a
90% sequence identity threshold, we obtained 11 394 representative chains,
including 2523 multi—domain chains—reducing the dataset size by ~85%.
This non—redundant chain set was then scanned against the CATH HMM
library as described in section 2.1, creating a list of matches as a starting
point for MDA prediction. For the analyses presented in the article, only
the multi—domain proteins were considered, since the accuracies on single
domain proteins were uniformly extremely high (data not shown).

2.5.2 Distant benchmark One ﬂaw with the benchmark set described
above is that every domain in the query sequence could have a ‘trivial’
match from a model seeded either from itself or a very close relative ( > 35%
sequence identity). To test that the results hold for sequences that are highly
diverged from the model seed domain, as is generally true for sequences in
UniProt, we constructed a ‘distant benchmark’.

Using sequence similarities calculated using the Needleman—Wunsch
algorithm (Needleman and Wunsch, 1970) for each domain in the PDB
benchmark set, we identiﬁed every model that had been seeded from
a domain with >35% sequence identity. Matches from those models
overlapping the domain were then excluded from the prediction set. If there
were two homologous adjacent domains, and the match overlapped both, it
was considered to be predicting the existence of the domain it overlapped
the most.

For some PDB sequences, the removal of matches meant that it was no
longer possible to deduce the correct MDA. These were removed from the
benchmark set. This left a total of 1318 multi—domain chains to analyse.

2.5.3 ‘Gapped’ benchmark For the PDB sequences used in the
benchmarks here, the structural composition of the chain has been completely
deﬁned. However, this is by no means true for sequences in Uniprot, which
may contain globular domain families that are not yet represented in PDB
or CATH. To test that HCF would still perform as expected, and not over—
predict the number of domains by ﬁlling in these gaps, we created a set
of benchmarks with a subset of superfamilies removed. This was done by
randomly dividing the superfamilies into ﬁve groups, and then creating ﬁve
benchmark sets for which one group of superfamilies had been ‘removed’
from each. To ‘remove’ a superfamily all instances of that superfamily were
removed from both the benchmark and prediction data. Any sequences that
were left with no ‘known’ MDA, because all the domains belonged to excised
superfamilies, were also removed. Between 1600—1923 proteins remained in
each sample, and the performance averaged over all ﬁve samples.

2.6 Measuring prediction accuracy

2. 6.1 Quantifying MDA accuracy The predicted multi—domain
architecture was considered correct if the superfamin types and the number
of occurrences of domains were predicted correctly, irrespective of whether
the number of segments or the boundary positions were correct. The overall
accuracy is then calculated over the whole dataset. If too many domains of
the correct superfamilies were predicted then this was termed a ‘semi—false
positive’, while if the extra domains belong to an incorrect superfamin it
was termed a ‘false positive’; if the MDA was missing a domain it was a
‘false negative’. A single predicted MDA could potentially contain errors in
all three classes.

2.6.2 Residue accuracy measure The MDA accuracy gives a good
measure of domain content, but does not take into account the accuracy
of the domain boundaries. To better quantify the accuracy of our predictions
we calculated the percentage of residues that were assigned to the correct
superfamily or no superfamin (i.e. linking regions).

2.7 Performance of DF2 and DF3 on UniProt and
Ensembl

The ﬁnal test is to demonstrate that the new method will improve the
annotations generated for Gene3D, as compared to previous releases. Domain
matches were obtained for UniProt release 14 (5 213 603 unique sequences)
and Ensembl v49 (858 815 unique protein sequences) as described in
Section 2.1. The matches were resolved using the original protocol of DF2—
a BMC method with one residue overlap threshold—and the new DF3
protocol—Heaviest Clique Finding and a 30 residue overlap threshold. A tiny
minority of sequences with a large number of matches (<0.005%) generated
sub—graphs of more than 6000 edges, normally with extremely high densities.

To maintain a reasonable processing speed these graphs were resolved using
the BMC approach instead of HCF.

3 RESULTS

A CATH benchmark dataset was constructed from a representative
set of sequences from the PDB, in order to evaluate the relative
performance of the BMC and HCF approaches, as well as the effect
of varying the allowed overlap threshold. If the domain assignment
and boundary resolution process was working accurately, we would
expect to be able to reconstruct the manual assignments by scanning
the PDB benchmark set against the CATH HMM library. Using
the same set of HMM results (the ‘prediction set’), we tested the
two approaches against each other, along with varying the allowed
overlap parameter.

Figure 4a shows a comparison of the accuracy of the two methods
with respect to correctly predicting the multi—domain architecture.

achieve at least the accuracy indicated on the x—axis. Shown are the accuracy
distributions for the BMC (grey) and HCF (black) methods with allowed
overlaps of 1 (triangles and crosses) and 30 residues (dashes and diamonds).
Using HCF with a 30 residue overlap achieves >90% accuracy for 75% of
chains, while only 50% of chains are at least that accurate when DF2 is used.

the BMC method only achieves 52% accuracy versus 68% for HCF.
Increasing the overlap threshold makes a substantial difference to
the percentage of correct predictions for both BMC and HCF, but
relies on the new overlap resolution mechanism in DF3.

An optimal overlap limit of 30 residues increases MDA prediction
accuracy from 68 to 91% for HCF, while BMC accuracy improves
from 52 to 84%. The superior performance of the HCF algorithm
largely arises from a decrease in false negatives (i.e. missing domain
assignments), although there is also some improvement in the
false positive rates (Fig. 4b). This improvement is conﬁrmed by
examining the residue assignment accuracy (Fig. 5): the original
version of DF2 (where overlap = 1) only annotated 50% of sequences
with >90% residue accuracy, while DF3 (where overlap = 30)
achieved this level of accuracy on 75% of sequences.

An alternative approach for determining the allowed overlap
is to use a percentage of the match length. As can be seen in
Figure 6, similarly high levels of accuracy are achieved by using a
threshold between 30 and 40% (using the HCF approach). However,
as noted in the Supplementary Data the true false positive rate for the
Gene3D models over this benchmark are very low; we suspect that
a percentage threshold will be less tolerant with noisy predictions. If
a match can be overlapped by up to 80% of its length (40% at each
end) then erroneous matches that do not align with the boundaries
of correct ones are more likely to be incorporated.

We have also tested whether limiting the prediction of
discontinuous domains to those superfamilies for which they have
been observed would improve the accuracy of the algorithm.
However, despite our concern that this might in fact over—ﬁt to the
benchmark data set, it slightly reduced overall performance (data
not shown).

The CATH benchmark, whilst useful for optimising parameters
and the core algorithm, does not completely emulate a real—world

of noisy data (see Fig. 7).

situation: scanning large, highly divergent, sequence databases
for which the nearest structural representative may have a very
dissimilar sequence. To better re—create this situation we generated
two smaller benchmark sets to capture key aspects of this variation,
as described in the section 2.5.2 (the ‘Distant Benchmark’) and 2.5.3
(the ‘Gapped Benchmark’). The results on the multi—domain proteins
show a similar distribution and proﬁle to the original benchmark (see
Fig. 7a and b), suggesting that the results for the main benchmark can
be considered to be generally representative of the relative accuracy
of the two approaches.

The benchmark results above give us conﬁdence that using HCF
and a 30 residue overlap limit—which we now term DF3—will
produce more accurate architectures and allow us to detect many
more domains. To test this we analysed their performance on large—
scale sequence databases.

To examine whether the new approach will translate into a
signiﬁcant improvement to the Gene3D resource, we searched a
sequence database comprising UniProt and Ensembl with Hmmer
and the CATH v3 .2.0 HMM library. The matches were then resolved
using both the old protocol, DF2 (BMC with a one residue allowed
overlap) and the newly deﬁned DF3 (heaviest weighted clique with
a 30 residue allowed overlap). In a very small number of cases
(<0.005% sequences) a graph was produced that contained more
than 6000 edges—for these, the HCF approach took at least a day and
sometimes much longer to calculate. Hence, matches for these query
sequences were instead resolved using BMC to keep the computation
time feasible. Both DF2 and DF3 ran across the whole set within two
days on two dual core 3.0 GHZ Intel Xeon CPUs. The DF algorithms
can be easily parallelized, and so can be distributed across multiple
CPUs. In practice, the overall speed is limited by the time taken to
solve the single most complex graph.

The MDAs predicted by DF3 for UniProt contained 600 000
more domains than those predicted by DF2 (an increase of 15%)
and a similar increase for Ensembl (20%) compared to DF2. The
majority of new domains were restricted to just a couple of hundred
superfamilies, though around half (~1000) of all superfamilies
showed a clear increase, and <l% showed any decrease (see Fig. 8).
Furthermore, whilst all of the matches to one superfamily were lost

CATH Superfamilies ordered by increase in size

Fig. 8. Extra annotations for UniProt. Ordering the CATH superfamilies by
the change in family size (x—axis), largest ﬁrst, and showing a cumulative total
(y—axis) clearly shows that most of the newly identiﬁed domain annotations
belong to ~10% of CATH superfamilies. However, about half of the
superfamilies make some contribution to the increase.

by DF3, 26 superfamilies that previously had no matches gained
representatives (see Supplementary Data for list).

The superfamilies that gained members showed no obvious shared
characteristics, other than that they usually occur in multi—domain
proteins. For example, there are a couple of viral structures from
polyproteins, some transmembrane families, and some domains that
are present in very common/universal protein families. A list of the
‘Top 20’ increases by numbers of sequences and numbers of domains
is shown in the Supplementary Data.

Of the superfamilies that lost members, many belonged to the
‘helical orthogonal bundle’ architecture (CATH: 1.10), and contain
small two helical hairpins. These super—families show signiﬁcant
cross—matching, and it can be hard to separate convergent and
divergent evolution. Essentially, in these cases the structural fold
is clear, but the precise evolutionary relationships are difﬁcult to
determine.

Using the Ensembl data set of eukaryotic genomic proteins, we
were also able to see how the distribution of different superfamilies
changes across the tree of life. This shows a similar behaviour to the
size changes, conﬁrming that a small number of superfamilies have
had their identiﬁed taxonomic range substantially expanded, while
for the majority the change has been slight (data not shown).

4 DISCUSSION

Accurate prediction of multi—domain architectures can be extremely
useful for many function and network prediction methods, including
phylogenetic proﬁling, gene fusion detection, protein—protein
interaction inheritance, and annotation by homology transfer.
However, current automated approaches are of unknown accuracy or
are compared with Pfam or InterPro, where manual curation requires
substantial investment. Both resources also contain many families
that are not based on single domains, which in turn creates problems
when benchmarking domain—related methods, such as ab initio
domain prediction algorithms. Gene3D aims to be a gold—standard
provider of domain family assignments, of equivalent accuracy to
the manually—curated resources. So we set out in the ﬁrst instance
to deﬁne a useful measure of our accuracy in predicting multi—
domain architectures, and then to improve on those predictions.
Since it is not possible to accurately estimate performance over
UniProt, we have generated a PDB—based benchmark that provides
a means of comparing different algorithms (i.e. BMC versus HCF).
Furthermore, we show that the results are likely to hold true for
scanning large protein sequence repositories, by simulating cases
of uncharacterised domain superfamilies and the absence of close
relatives.

The benchmarks suggest that using DF3—HCF and 30—residue
allowed overlap—leads to a 35% increase in accuracy compared to
the old DF protocol for predicting multi—domain architecture from
a list of matches to a HMM model library. Including single domain
proteins, the overall accuracy is ~95%, with many of the errors
due to erroneous structures and assignments in the PDB and CATH.
Most of the increase in multi—domain prediction accuracy is due to
the loss of false negatives, and so would be expected to translate into
an increased number of domains found in the sequence databases.
As expected, the number of domains found in UniProt and Ensembl
increased by ~l5—20%. As of Gene3D version 8 all annotations
have been generated using DF3.

There remains some room for improvement on the speciﬁc
failures, and many common MDA archetypes, especially
transmembrane proteins, are simply not present in the PDB.

Resolving protein domain architectures

 

Hence, to further characterise and improve the accuracy of our
predictive method will require a deeper analysis, and closer manual
investigation of predictions, and the construction of artiﬁcial sets
that better represent the protein world.

However, DF3 provides a robust prediction resolution process,
and further signiﬁcant increases in accuracy are likely to come
from improvements in the construction of the domain superfamin
proﬁles, and the HMM scanning software itself. DF3 is fast and
accurate, and can be run on large—scale sequence databases and
with large model libraries. The mechanism of building a weighted
graph and ﬁnding the heaviest clique is a general solution for
creating a minimum set of best representatives given a set of
overlapping predictions, and most aspects of the protocol can be
adapted as needed. An example use could be optimising the selection
of templates for comparative modelling of multi—domain protein
structures. Alternatively, it can be used to integrate assignments from
multiple resources, by using an appropriate weighting mechanism.
For instance, it could be easily adapted to merge Pfam and CATH
assignments. As of version v9.0.0 Gene3D provides CATH domain
assignments for ~55% of proteins, while Pfam covers ~65%.
Combining the two provides annotations for ~75% of known protein
sequences.

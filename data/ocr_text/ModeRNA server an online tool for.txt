ABSTRACT

Summary: The diverse functional roles of non-coding RNA
molecules are determined by their underlying structure. ModeRNA
server is an online tool for RNA 3D structure modeling by the
comparative approach, based on a template RNA structure and a
user-defined target-template sequence alignment. It offers an option
to search for potential templates, given the target sequence. The
server also provides tools for analyzing, editing and formatting of
RNA structure files. It facilitates the use of the ModeRNA software
and offers new options in comparison to the standalone program.
Availability and implementation: ModeRNA server was
implemented using the Python language and the Django web
framework. It is freely available at
http://iimcb.genesilico.pl/modernaserver.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non—coding RNAs have important catalytic and regulatory functions
in organisms from all domains of life. The high costs and numerous
obstacles in nucleic acid structure determination prompted the
development of in silico RNA modeling methods, in analogy to
similar efforts in the protein structure modeling ﬁeld (Rother et al.,
2011a). One successful approach is comparative modeling, based on
the experimental observation that in evolutionarily related RNAs,
3D structure is typically more conserved than sequence (Capriotti
and Marti—Renom, 2010). We have recently developed ModeRNA,
a standalone tool for RNA 3D structure prediction based on the
comparative modeling approach (Rother et al., 2011b). Here, we
present a web server, which considerably extends the functionality
of our original method.

2 USAGE OF THE MODERNA SERVER

The ModeRNA server enables three main functionalities: searching
the Protein Data Bank for a suitable RNA structure to be used as a
modeling template, analyzing/editing/formatting the structure, and

building a model for a target sequence, based on its alignment to the
template (Fig. 1):

Template identiﬁcation: in order to create a model according to the
comparative approach, the user has to provide a template (a known
RNA structure in the PDB format), and an alignment between the
sequence to be modeled (the target) and the template. The original
ModeRNA method did not support any method for identiﬁcation of
potential templates. ModeRNA server can be queried with a target
RNA sequence, and employs ParAlign (Rognes, 2001) to identify
families of related sequences in the RfamSeq10 database (Gardner
et al., 2009) that possess structurally characterized representatives.
For each identiﬁed family, the server returns a covariance model
derived from the Rfam multiple sequence alignment and pairwise
sequence alignments of the target with the tentative templates (with
resolution 5 2.5 A) obtained with Infernal (Nawrocki et al., 2009).
This simple procedure does not guarantee that the template or
the target—template alignment are correct, but provides the user
with a convenient starting point for further analyses, e. g. manual
reﬁnement.

Analyzing and editing the structure: ModeRNA server can
recognize several common variations of the PDB format and
supports reformatting of the structure ﬁles. This facilitates
interoperability with other tools for RNA structure analysis. It also
provides a number of simple geometry checks that can be used to
test both template and model structures for the possible presence
of unusual bond lengths, ﬂat and torsion angles and interatomic
clashes. ModeRNA server can remove water, ions and ligands, add
missing phosphate groups, renumber residues and standardize the
atom names to those used by the PDB (which may be a necessary
step for template preparation). Straightforward changes such as
addition or removal of post—transcriptional modiﬁcations or single
residue substitutions can be introduced. Finally, the server outputs
the sequence and secondary structure of the RNA structure analyzed.

Template-based modeling: ModeRNA server can be used as a
front—end to produce a model of the RNA using the ModeRNA
method in its ‘basic’ mode (without extensive scripting). It copies
coordinates of identical residues from the template, replaces
substituted residues with those from the target, models insertions
and deletions using fragments from a database, and edits post—
transcriptional modiﬁcations, according to the alignment. A detailed
description of the ModeRNA workﬂow has been published (Rother
et al., 2011b). The similarity of the template and target structures
(resulting from their evolutionary conservation and conditions of
structure determination) and the accuracy of sequence alignment are
the major determinants of model quality. Typically, target—template
alignments have to be checked and curated manually. For wrong

templates and wrong alignments ModeRNA will always produce
wrong models, which can be actually a useful feature, e.g. for
generation of structural decoys.

For targets with unknown structure, the accuracy of the model
is unknown. We recommend to evaluate the likelihood of model
correctness by using independent scoring functions, e.g. the recently
developed RASP potential (Capriotti et al., 2011), and (whenever
possible) by critical assessment with respect to agreement with
experimental data.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

ModeRNA server was implemented using the Django web
framework (http://www.djangoproject.com/) and the Python
programming language (http://www.python.org/). The results
are displayed on a separate page using the Jmol applet to
show 3D models (http://www.jmol.org/). The VARNA applet
(http://varna.lri.fr/) is used to show secondary structures. All results
are kept on the server, currently without time limits.

4 DISCUSSION

ModeRNA server is an important extension of the standalone
application for RNA template—based 3D structure modeling, as it
enables the use of ModeRNA by users with limited computer skills.
The major added value of the server is the availability of a template
search tool, and tools for preparation of template and alignment ﬁles.
One should be aware that the server does not cover the full range
of functions included in the standalone program, e.g. multi—template
modeling. For detailed discussions of possibilities, limitations and
alternative programs for homology and ab initio modeling of RNA,
see (Rother et al., 2011a,b). However, for straightforward model
building from a template structure and alignment, especially when

the template and target are highly similar, ModeRNA server is an
ideal solution.

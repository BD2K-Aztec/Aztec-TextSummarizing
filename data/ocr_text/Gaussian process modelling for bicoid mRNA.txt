ABSTRACT

Motivation: Bicoid protein molecules, translated from maternally
provided bicoid mRNA, establish a concentration gradient in
Drosophila early embryonic development. There is experimental
evidence that the synthesis and subsequent destruction of this
protein is regulated at source by precise control of the stability of
the maternal mRNA. Can we infer the driving function at the source
from noisy observations of the spatio-temporal protein profile? We
use non-parametric Gaussian process regression for modelling the
propagation of Bicoid in the embryo and infer aspects of source
regulation as a posterior function.

Results: With synthetic data from a 1 D diffusion model with a source
simulated to model mRNA stability regulation, our results establish
that the Gaussian process method can accurately infer the driving
function and capture the spatio-temporal dynamics of embryonic
Bicoid propagation. On real data from the FlyEX database, too, the
reconstructed source function is indicative of stability regulation, but
is temporally smoother than what we expected, partly due to the
fact that the dataset is only partially observed. To be in line with
recent thinking on the subject, we also analyse this model with a
spatial gradient of maternal mRNA, rather than being fixed at only
the anterior pole.

1 INTRODUCTION

Patterning, during embryonic development, is thought to be
regulated by a class of molecules known as morphogens, which
propagate spatially and establish concentration gradients. As early
as 1952, Turing (1952) hypothesized that a reaction—diffusion
mechanism might form the basis of such differential concentrations.
Wolpert (1969) further developed this view as a universal
mechanism of spatial pattern formation arising from position—
dependent cell fate. Subsequently, Driever and Nusslein—Volhard
(1988a, b) discovered the role of the Bicoid morphogen in early
embryonic development of the fruit ﬂy Drosophila melanogaster.
Bicoid sets up a concentration gradient along the anterior—posterior
(A—P) axis of the embryo and regulates several downstream gap
genes including Hunchback and Kriippel, which are implicated in

segmentation along the A—P axis (Driever and Nusslein—Volhard,
1989; Ephrussi and Johnston, 2004; Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002;
Johnston et al., 1989; Struhl et al., 1989). The bicoid mRNA is
maternal, deposited at the anterior pole of the embryo and translation
of this mRNA is thought to begin immediately after egg deposition
(Driever and Nusslein—Volhard, 1989) with the resulting protein
propagating towards the posterior end. Most of the computational
and experimental work on the Bicoid morphogen is concerned
with the establishment of the steady state concentration gradient,
and the sensitivity with which a threshold on it may be sensed
for downstream gene expression (Gregor et al., 2005, 2007a, b;
Hecht et al., 2009; He at al., 2010; Holloway et al., 2006;
Houchmandzadeh et al., 2002; Lehr et al., 2010). Systematic
computational modelling of downstream gap gene circuits, and how
their non—linear interactions result in segment boundary formation
have also been published in Ashyraliyev et al. (2009); Jaeger
et al. (2004); Reinitz and Sharp (1995), and include steady state
exponential Bicoid expression proﬁles as a regulating input. In an
alternate view of the dynamics of this system, Bergmann et al. (2007)
suggested that much of the desirable decoding properties of the
steady state proﬁle can also be realized during the pre—steady—state
stages.

A particularly novel insight into the process of Bicoid translation
comes from the experimental work of Surdej and Jacobs—Lorena
(1998). These authors suggested that the stability of the maternal
mRNA may be systematically regulated; i.e. kept stable for a
period of time during which mRNA is translated and morphogen
synthesized, and subsequently rapidly killed off by some active
processes. This observation, of course, matches our natural
expectation as there is no need for the organism to continue to
produce Bicoid protein beyond the point in time when it is decoded.
However, to our surprise, modelling literature over the 30 years
since the discovery of Bicoid ignore this possibility and assume a
constant production rate at the anterior pole. We showed recently
(Liu and Niranjan, 2009, 2011) that it is possible to model Bicoid
production in a manner similar to Surdej and J acobs—Lorena (1998)’s
experimental ﬁndings and computationally extract the time at which
mRNA decay begins, and the rate at which it is killed off, to match
data measured on real ﬂy embryos and archived in the FlyEX
database (Pisarev et al., 2009). We used an explicit model of mRNA
stability regulation and a least squares ﬁtting procedure between
model output and observed data.

Bayesian inference has been shown to be useful in a range
of applications including systems biology and bioinformatics.
Successful examples range from the identiﬁcation of
gene regulatory networks by dynamic Bayesian networks

Inference for bicoid mRNA regulation stability

 

(Husmeier, 2003; Peer et al., 2001; Perrin et al., 2003), network
inference using informative priors (Mukherjee and Speed,
2008), inference of transcription regulation using a state space
model (Sanguinetti et al., 2006a, b), approximate inference
using variational methods for the spatio—temporal Bicoid system
(Dewar et al., 2010) and parameter estimation using Monte Carlo
simulations to understand stochastic dynamics of bacterial gene
regulation (Wilkinson, 2011).

In this article, we build on these algorithmic foundations and apply
the non—parametric probabilistic approach of Gaussian Process (GP)
regression (Rasmussen and Williams, 2006) to address the problem
of modelling Bicoid morphogen propagation. The GP model is
the tool of choice for regression problems characterized by the
need to model uncertainties and deal with unobserved data in a
systematic way, both of which are aspects of our problem. The
approach has been demonstrated in a wide range of applications
in the machine learning literature. Speciﬁcally, Gao et al. (2008);
Lawrence et al. (2007) and Honkela et al. (2010) studied interesting
problems in biological modelling with GPs. The pioneering work
on this is due to Lawrence et al. (2007) in which GPs were shown
to be very effective in inferring target genes regulated by the
tumour suppression transcription factor p53, providing an efﬁcient
alternative to the Monte Carlo approach advanced earlier by Barenco
et al. (2006). Later publications have further conﬁrmed the validity
of the approach on other datasets of gene expression time series.

Apart from Dewar et al. (2010), the work on Bayesian methods
mentioned above addressed purely temporal phenomena. Our work,
on the other hand, is on a spatio—temporal problem and differs
from Dewar et al. (2010) in the sense that we are interested in
inferring the source driving function that corresponds to the stability
regulation observed by Surdej and J acobs—Lorena (1998). Alvarez
et al. (2009) describe a similar attempt at combining a data—driven
model (GP) with a latent process explaining the known physics of
a system. They consider the heat equation, which is a simpliﬁed
form of a diffusion system, to model the spatio—temporal proﬁle of
pollution. In this work, we derive the computational strategy needed
to extend Lawrence et al. (2007)’s work to deal with spatio—temporal
problems, and demonstrate its application to Bicoid regulation
modelling using both synthetic data and real dataset from FlyEX
database (Pisarev et al., 2009). The results demonstrate the power of
the method on synthetic and its limitations on real data. As such, ours
is the ﬁrst contribution that adapts the powerful algorithmic setting
of non—parametric regression to tackle an important spatio—temporal
inference problem in developmental biology.

2 METHODS

2.1 Bicoid spatio-temporal reaction-diffusion system

The partial differential equation, governing diffusion of Bicoid along a 1D
anterior—posterior axis, we start from:

2

$m(x,t)=D%m(x,t) — rp—1m(x,t)+SQf(t), (1)

where m(x, t) is the morphogen concentration as a spatio—temporal function,
D, the diffusion constant and IP, the half—life of the morphogen protein. f (t),
the source, is the mRNA regulation function which we consider unknown
and place a prior distribution over. A linear gain term So is included to allow
scaling of the data to match observations. There is an implicit assumption of a
one to one mapping between mRNA regulation and the corresponding protein
production, which we believe is justiﬁed as there is no evidence available of

either post—transcriptional or post—translational regulation of Bicoid in this
developmental system.

We consider the embryo as consisting of N cubes along the A—P axis in
order to derive a linear dynamical system model from the continuous spatial
diffusion equation. The basic idea for this stems from the work of Erban
et a]. (2007) (see later). With this discretization into N cubes, the chemical
reactions involved in the diffusion process are as follows:

d
BicoidifBicoidl-H, for i=1,2,...,N—1 (2)
1.71
Bicoidip—>0, for i=1,2,...,N (3)
S
0 & Bicoidl. (4)

The ﬁrst of these reactions, Equation (2), is Bicoid protein diffusion between
neighbouring subvolumes with rate constant d, where d is given by d =D/h2
and h is length of each cube. The second process in Equation (3) describes
Bicoid protein degradation. Finally, Equation (4) is the translation of Bicoid
proteins from the maternal mRNA with f (t) being the latent function that
needs to be inferred.

2.2 Linear dynamical system for Bicoid proﬁle

We implemented a model in which source production occurs in a smaller
ﬁrst cube with length hf (5 um—the length of a nucleus) and the other N — 1
cubes (h: 10 um) equally splitting the remaining A—P axis. Therefore, the
rate constants are different between the ﬁrst cube (df), where mRNA is
produced and its stability regulated, and the other cubes (d):

df =D/(hfh), (5)

dzD/hz. (6)

In order to develop a linear dynamical system for Bicoid proﬁle, following
Erban et a]. (2007), we rewrite the partial differential equation in Equation
(1) as a system of ordinary differential equations for the morphogen
concentration in each bin (i = 1, ...,N):

a

5m1(t)=df(m2(t)—m1(t))—r,;1m1(t)+SQf(t). (7)

a

5mi(r)=d(mi+1(t)+mi_1(t)—2mi(t))—r,;1mi(r), (8)
a
a N(t)=d(mN_1(t)—mN(t»—r,:1mN(r). (9)

Deﬁning m(t)=[m1(t),...,mN(t)]T, the linear dynamical system for
Bicoid reaction—diffusion system is then vectorized as:

any =Am(t)+sf(t), (10)

 

where the spatial transition matrix A (N x N) is deﬁned by:

—(df+rp-1) df 0  0 0
d —(2d+rp‘1) d  0 0

l 0

and source production rate s = [50, 0, ...,0]T.
The solution to Equation (10), m(t), giving the Bicoid spatio—temporal
proﬁle, is in terms of a matrix exponential and is given by:

0 0  d —(d+r,,—1)J

I
m(t)=exp(tA)m(0)+ f exp((t—u)A)sf(u)du, (11)
0

where m(0) is zero at the beginning of the embryo development.

2.3 Gaussian process modelling

We treat bicoid mRNA as a function drawn from a GP and extend it to the
spatio—temporal application of Bicoid dynamical system. The GP prior for
the latent mRNA regulation is deﬁned by mean and covariance functions:

f(t)~N(0.kf,f(t.t/)). (12)
where kf, f (t, t’ ) is given by squared exponential covariance function with the
length scale I:

 

_ / 2
kf,f(tat/)=6XP(—(t I: )  (13)

Because the right—hand side of Equation (11) is linear, as noted by Lawrence
et a]. (2007) in the content of modelling transcription regulation, m(t) turns
out to be a multivariate function drawn from a GP:

m(t) ~N(exp(tA)m(0), Km,m(t, t/)). (14)
The corresponding cross covariance function Km,m(t, ﬂ) is given by:
Km,m(tat/)= (15)

t t’
f f exp((t — u)A)s(exp((t/ — u/)A)s)ka,f(u, u/)dudu/.
0 0

The cross covariance function between m(t) and f (t) becomes

I
kmfoj): f exp((t—u)A)skf,f(u, t/)du. (16)
0

These expressions can be derived analytically and the derivation details are
shown in Supplementary Material.

2.4 Predictive distribution

Let f... be a vector of J... values of the source function at equally spaced
time points, and m? be the corresponding protein proﬁles at these instances
in time, within the i—th cube along the A—P axis. Concatenating these,
we deﬁne h... = [f...,m’f, ...,m}'{,]T corresponding to J... +NJ... test points. The
corresponding training data consists of the morphogen values in the N cubes,
taken at J points in time, and a ﬁxed source value f, contained in the vector
h: [f,m1, ...,mN]T of dimension 1+NJ.

With the above notation, the mean and covariance of the posterior
distribution are given by:

BE°St=Kh.,hK.;1y, (17)
 =Kh*,h* ‘Kh*.hK1;1.Kh,h.. (18)

Each covariance matrix in Equations (17) and (18) is partitioned across the
source and N Bicoid intensities in different cubes. Illustrating this for Khhh,

Kfmf Kf*,m1 Kf*,m2  Kf...,mN
Kmiaf Kmiksml K111131112  KmiksmN

K * K * K ..  K ..
m ,f m,m1 m ,m2 m ,mN
Kh*,h_| 2 2 2 2

[ij’tpf ij’fl,m1 ' Km;,mNJ
Therefore, the dimensions of the covariance matrices Km ’11, K111. and Kh*,h*
are (J... +NJ...) x (1 +NJ), (1 +NJ) x (1 +NJ) and (J... +NJ...) x (J... +NJ...),
respectively. The observations, collected in vector y of dimension 1+NJ,
are assumed to be corrupted by additive noise as

 

yi(t)=mi(t)+ei(t). (19)

where e.(t) are drawn from N (0,030)). Hence,
Ky,y = Kh,h + E. (20)
2=diag(o},0121,“47%,...,o§.1,...,o§.1). (21)

With the hyperparameter vector 0;. = [1,02, 0121 , “47%, ...,o§,1 , ...,0§U], the
likelihood is:

1901011): fP(YI0haf)P(f|0h)df- (22)

The observations are taken from FlyEX integrated data. To get an
estimate of the noise levels and the length scale I, we maximized the above

likelihood following Rasmussen and Williams (2006). Estimates of these
hyperparameters are given in Supplementary Material. When simulating
synthetic data, we added zero mean Gaussian noise of SD 0201, and
assumed it to be known.

For model parameter estimation, we evaluated least squared error between
Bicoid ODE system [Equations (7)—(9)] output (mmOdel) and measured
intensities from FlyEX database (mdata) to estimate the parameters: diffusion
constant D (3 umz /s) and protein half—life rp (86min) (Liu and Niranjan,
2011):

C14A.8 N

Ls: Z 2(Somgf30del—mﬁjlta> . (23)

j=C11 i=1

Note we have estimated the hyperparameters using maximum likelihood
and set the model parameters by least squares ﬁtting. Ideally, one would
like to exploit the elegance of the GP framework and estimate all these by
maximum likelihood. To achieve this, we need analytical expressions for
the covariance matrices and their derivatives. We discuss this further in the
Supplementary Material.

Since the production concentration So is independent of D and IP and is
linear of the model output, we differentiate the Equation (23) with respect
to So and set it to zero. The calculation for So is given by:

SO 2   1 mgodelmldata (24)

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Inference of mRNA regulation function

We ﬁrst assume that bicoid mRNA is localized and its regulation
occurs only in the anterior pole, the ﬁrst cube in our discretized
model. Therefore, source production amplitude vector is given by

s=[50,0,...,0]T. (25)

We examine the performance of our GP approach on two synthetic
datasets (Figs 1 and 2) and an experimental dataset (Fig. 3).

As in our previous work (Liu and Niranjan, 2009), to generate
synthetic data, we implemented mRNA stability regulation by the
function

f (t) =5(x) (@(t) — 90 —t0)) (26)

 

+6(x)®(t—t0)exp(—t—t0),
Tm
which characterizes mRNA, and hence the production of Bicoid
protein, to be stable and constant to time to, followed by an
exponential decay of time constant rm. 6 is the Kronecker delta
function and (9 is the Heaviside step function. The parameter values
taken from our previous work, estimated by a least squares ﬁt
between model output and FlyEX measurements, are to = 144 min
and rm =9min. The dashed lines in Figures 1B, 2B and 3B show
the true source function according to our hypothesis on regulation
[Equation (26)].

Figure 1A shows the synthetic training data using the ODE
system of Equation (7)—(9) with additive noise over the entire
developmental period of 0~200 min, with 20 equally spaced time
points and 51 cubes along the A—P axis. Figure 1B shows the
estimated mRNA regulation function, Sofa), from the GP approach.
We see that the GP is able to recover the regulated source function
quite well, though the resulting estimate is smoother. This is to

Fig. 4. Predicted temporal posterior distribution of Bicoid protein concentrations in individual cubes on different training datasets. The mean inference
and 95% conﬁdence intervals are shown with solid lines and grey area. The crosses represent three different training datasets shown in Figures 1—3.
Panels (A—C) are inferred on synthetic dataset with full—time scale while the partial synthetic dataset is used in (D—F). Panels (G—I) are inferred on real dataset

from FlyEx.

data, shown in Figure 2A as input. As expected, in Figure 2B,
the credible interval is wider at the early stages where no data are
present and narrow during 106 — 178 min. Still, the GP posterior of
the morphogen proﬁle captures the spatio—temporal dynamics well
and contains the sharp post—peak decay.

Figure 3 shows the behaviour of the GP model on real data from
FlyEx, with ﬁgure 3A, 3B and 3C showing the data, inferred source
and model based spatio—temporal morphogen proﬁle, respectively.
We see that the reconstructed proﬁle accurately reproduces the
establishment of Bicoid gradient and subsequent decay. The inferred
source function is smoother than our hypothesized model, but
contains the basic elements of an approximately constant part and
subsequent decay. The noisy nature of the data causes the resulting
uncertainties to be very high. Noise levels inferred from a maximum
likelihood setting [Equation (22)] is shown in Supplementary Figure
S 1. These are much higher than the variance of the additive noise we
used to construct the synthetic data of Figures 1 and 2. Further, we
note that the source of uncertainty in the data is not purely additive
instrument noise. FlyEx measurements do not come from the
observations on a single embryo. They are taken from populations
of embryos, harvested at various stages of development. The effect
of this is not modelled anywhere in our approach.

As noted, the GP inferred source functions are smoother than
hypothesized by our model. A consequence of smooth functions
ﬁtting the data is also that the temporal point at which mRNA

begins to decay starts earlier. The rapid change between mRNA
being translated and killed off is not explicitly modelled in the
GP approach. Such rapid changes may well be better modelled
in a probabilistic framework that explicitly incorporates switching
behaviour, such as the two—state Markov Jump process (also known
as a telegraph process) considered in Sanguinetti et al. (2009).

Figure 4 shows the predicted temporal proﬁles of the Bicoid at
three adjacent spatial points along the embryo.1 The training data
are also shown. The three rows in the ﬁgure correspond to cases
illustrated in Figures 1—3. We see that at the level of the GP model
generating the data, reasonably good ﬁts are obtained. With real data,
we see high uncertainties in regions where data are not present.

3.2 Non-localized maternal mRNA

Additionally, we show in Figure 5 cross sections of the
spatio—temporal proﬁles, taken along the A—P axis at different
developmental cycles. Here, we see that the exponential spatial
decays of FlyEx measurements are faithfully captured by the GP
model. We also observe that most of the mismatch between model
output and measured data is towards the anterior part of the A—P
axis. This mismatch motivates one to question the use of a highly
localized point source as the input to the diffusion system.

 

1These cubes are chosen for illustration because these are locations where
much of the variation is happening.

Fig. 5. Inferred posterior distribution of spatial Bicoid protein concentrations in the ﬁxed time points from Cyclell (A) to Cyclel4A.6 (I) on the real dataset.
The crosses show the observed protein spatial data in different developmental time points.

In the literature, Spirov et al. (2009) and Little et al. (2011) have
discussed the scenario in which maternal bicoid mRNA itself has
a spatial gradient (i.e. non—localized). While Spirov et al. (2009)
considered this mRNA spatial proﬁle to be the main determinant
of morphogen gradient, Little et al. (2011) concluded that > 90%
of total bicoid mRNA is within the anterior 20% EL, and this
alone is insufﬁcient to establish the required spatial gradient of
the protein in the time available over the length scale of interest.
We also simulated this possibility in our GP models, with maternal
mRNA being spatially distributed in the ﬁrst 10 of the 50 cubes
(h: 10am) with an initial exponentially decaying spatial proﬁle.
The corresponding results of the inferred mean source (now a spatio—
temporal proﬁle) and the GP mean morphogen proﬁle are shown
in Supplementary Figure S4B and C. We note that in this case,
the onset of mRNA decay begins slightly earlier than for the point
source in the ﬁrst bin, which is to be expected since the mRNA
spatial distribution contributes to the generation of morphogen upto
20%EL, and the destruction has to start earlier to compensate.
As seen in Supplementary Figure S5, the ﬁt to the data does improve
with spatially distributed mRNA. We include this for completeness,
showing that a GP model can be applied in a ﬂexible way in this
manner, but do not think that the results can resolve the differences
discussed by Spirov et al. (2009) and Little et al. (2011).

4 CONCLUSION

In this contribution, we have shown that the non—parametric
GP regression model can be effectively applied to the problem
of inferring biologically useful information from the spatio—
temporal distribution of the Bicoid morphogen in early Drosophila
embryogenesis. Discretization of the spatial domain transforms the

spatio—temporal problem into a dynamical system for which, with
a GP prior imposed on the source, the solution can be obtained as
a matrix exponential. With synthetic data obtained from a linear
spatio—temporal dynamical system, our results show that the GP
approach is able to accurately recover the driving input and model
the Bicoid distribution. On real world data, our results also estimate a
smoothed version of the driving input due to the data being available
only during part of the developmental process, and yet the part of
the source decay is fairly well estimated.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that are
extensively involved in gene expression regulation. One major road-
block in functional miRNA studies is the reliable prediction of genes
targeted by miRNAs, as rules defining miRNA target recognition have
not been well-established to date. Availability of high-throughput ex-
perimental data from a recent CLASH (cross linking, ligation and
sequencing of hybrids) study has presented an unprecedented oppor-
tunity to characterize miRNA target recognition patterns, which may
provide guidance for improved miRNA target prediction.

Results: The CLASH data were analysed to identify distinctive se-
quence features that characterize canonical and non-canonical
miRNA target types. Most miRNA targets were of non-canonical
type, i.e. without involving perfect pairing to canonical miRNA seed
region. Different miRNAs have distinct targeting patterns, and this
miRNA-to—miRNA variability was associated with seed sequence com-
position. Specifically, seed-based canonical target recognition was
dependent on the GC content of the miRNA seed. For miRNAs with
low GC content of the seed region, non-canonical targeting was the
dominant mechanism for target recognition. In contrast to canonical
targeting, non-canonical targeting did not lead to significant target
downregulation at either the RNA or protein level.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNAs
that play important regulatory roles in many physiological and
disease processes (Ambros, 2004; Miska, 2005). About 2000
human miRNAs have been discovered to date (Kozomara and
Grifﬁths-J ones, 2011), and collectively these miRNAs regulate
the expression of thousands of genes at both post-transcriptional
and translational levels (Baek et al., 2008; Selbach et al., 2008).
Thus, identiﬁcation of gene targets is critical for functional char-
acterization of miRNAs.

Currently, most researchers rely on computational tools to
initially identify target candidates for further experimental valid-
ation. Signiﬁcant progress has been made in recent years for the
identiﬁcation of sequence features relevant to target prediction,
such as the seed sequence at the 5’ end of the miRNA as well as
the sequence context surrounding the seed binding site of the
target transcript (Bartel, 2009). However, despite the progress,
current bioinformatics target prediction tools still have subopti-
mal performance with both high false-positive and false-negative

rates (Saito and Saetrom, 2010). One major obstacle in computa-
tional target prediction is the lack of guidance from experimental
observations. To address this issue, multiple high-throughput stu-
dies have been performed in recent years to systematically identify
miRNA targets at the transcriptome level. For example, one
major experimental strategy is to identify target transcripts asso-
ciated with functional RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC;
Chi et al., 2009; Hafner et al., 2010). These methods were able
to identify a large number of miRNA target transcripts that were
bound to RISC by cross-linking immunoprecipitation followed by
high-throughput RNA sequencing (CLIP-seq). In addition, prote-
omics and ribosome studies have been performed to systematic-
ally characterize target expression at the translational level (Baek
et al., 2008; Guo et al., 2010; Hendrickson et al., 2009; Selbach
et al., 2008).

More recently, CLASH (cross linking, ligation and sequencing
of hybrids), an improved CLIP-seq method, has been developed
to directly identify miRNA-target pairs by ligation and sequen-
cing of miRNA-target RNA duplexes (Helwak et al., 2013).This
new method can simultaneously identify both the miRNAs and
their cognate binding sites in the target transcripts, allowing
direct characterization of sequence features relevant to miRNA
target recognition. With CLASH, thousands of miRNA-target
pairs were identiﬁed (Helwak et al., 2013). Interestingly, the ma-
jority of the target sites contained no canonical seed pairing site,
suggesting that other sequence features of the miRNAs played a
dominant role in target recognition. In our study, we systemat-
ically analysed the sequence composition of the miRNAs and
paired target sites from the CLASH data, and identiﬁed sequence
features that distinguished canonical from non-canonical
miRNA targets.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data retrieval

The CLASH dataset was available as Supplementary Data in (Helwak
et al., 2013). This dataset was downloaded from the journal’s website and
analysed in our study. In this published study, HEK293 cells overexpres-
sing human AGOl were crosslinked by ultraviolet irradiation. The cross-
linked RNA-induced silencing complex (RISC), containing both
miRNAs and cognate mRNA target transcripts, were immunoprecipi-
tated using an antibody that speciﬁcally binds to the tagged hAGOl in
the RISC. RNA—RNA ligation was then performed for the isolated RISC
complexes to covalently ligate the miRNAs and cognate mRNA target
transcripts. Ligated RNA products were ﬁnally used as a template for
RNA-seq library construction, and the identity of both miRNAs and
their paired mRNA target transcripts were determined by sequencing

chimeric miRNA-target RNA. Altogether, 18 514 miRNA-target pairs
were identiﬁed in this way.

Microarray data from the photoactivatable-ribonucleoside (PAR)-
CLIP study (Hafner et al., 2010) were used to evaluate the impact of
miRNAs on target RNA expression regulation. In this microarray
study, 25 miRNAs were concurrently suppressed in HEK293 cells by a
pool of antisense oligonucleotide inhibitors, and the impact on target
expression regulation at the transcriptional level was determined by
Affymetrix Human U133P1us2 chips. Raw microarray data were down-
loaded from the NCBI GEO database (Barrett et al., 2013), and array
signals were normalized using the robust multiarray averaging method
from the Bioconductor package (http://www.bioconductor.org). Signals
from transcripts of the same gene were combined and averaged using
Gene mapping index ﬁles downloaded from the NCBI ftp site (Maglott
et al., 2011). The log2-transformed fold change of each gene after miRNA
depletion was calculated by comparing with the negative control arrays
(mock transfections).

Proteomic data from (Selbach et al., 2008) were retrieved from
the online Supplementary File at the journal’s website, and used to evalu-
ate the impact of miRNA on target protein expression. In the Selbach
study, ﬁve miRNAs (let-7b, miR-l, miR-16, miR-30a and miR-155)
were individually overexpressed in HeLa cells and changes in protein
synthesis were determined with mass spectrometry-based proteomic
analysis. Protein expression changes were represented by log2-
transforrned fold change as compared with the negative control (mock
transfections).

2.2 Data analysis

Thermodynamic stability of miRNA-target RNA duplex, as represented
by the AG value, was calculated with RNAfold (Hofacker, 2003). The
stability of perfect base pairing between miRNA seed/non—seed sequence
and the target binding site was calculated with the nearest neighbor
method and thermodynamic parameters for RNA—RNA base pairing
06a et al., 1998). Canonical seed is deﬁned as any 6-mer sequence
within positions 2—8 or 7-mer sequence within positions 1—8 of the
miRNA; extended seed is deﬁned as any 6-mer sequence within
miRNA positions 4—10; and non-seed sequence is any sequence down-
stream of the extended seed region. Sequences of the miRNAs and their
cognate target sites from the CLASH dataset were compared to identify
base pairing patterns, including perfect pairing, imperfect pairing with a
GU mismatch and imperfect pairing with a non-GU mismatch. As nega-
tive control, the target transcript from each miRNA-target pair was
replaced by a randomly selected transcript from the CLASH dataset
(shufﬂed control), and stochastic pairing pattern between the miRNA
and random transcript was determined. The enrichment ratio of each
base-pairing pattern between the miRNAs and paired target sites was
calculated by comparing with the negative control. Statistical difference
between various targeting patterns and the negative control for thermo-
dynamic stability or gene expression change was calculated with Student’s
t-test.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Canonical seed pairing was absent in most miRNA
target sites

Using the CLASH method, 18 514 pairs of miRNAs and cognate
target binding sites were identiﬁed (Helwak et al., 2013). Here,
we reanalysed this dataset to identify sequence features that are
signiﬁcantly associated with miRNA targets. One well-character-
ized feature is the perfect pairing between canonical miRNA seed
(positions 2—8) and the target binding site. The 3’ portion of the
miRNA was generally considered to play an auxiliary role, with

Position of 6-merin miRNA Sequence

Fig. 1. Occurrence of target sites matching to miRNA 6-mer words. For
each miRNA-target pair, the 6-mer word from each position of the
miRNA sequence was compared with the target sequence to identify
any perfect base pairing. The numbers of miRNA-target pairs with 6-
mer match at the same miRNA positions were summarized and presented
in the graph. As negative control, the cognate target sequence in each
miRNA-target pair was replaced with a randomly assigned non-target
transcript sequence for 6-mer word analysis (shufﬂed control). The nega-
tive control simulation run was repeated 10 times and the average number
of matched 6-mers at each position was presented (:l:SD)

perfect seed pairing as the dominant determinant (Bartel, 2009).
To reassess the relative importance of both seed and non-seed
sequences in target recognition, all possible 6-mers from the
miRNA sequences were compared with the corresponding
paired target sites. Speciﬁcally, for each miRNA-target pair,
the entire miRNA sequence was scanned to identify all pos-
ition-speciﬁc 6-mers that were matched to the target sequence.
As negative control, each miRNA sequence was compared with a
randomly assigned transcript from the CLASH dataset (shufﬂed
control). Overall, 6-mers from positions 3—8 were most enriched,
which fall within the canonical seed region (Fig. 1). The other
6-mer position from the canonical seed region (nucleotides 2—7)
was ranked as the third most enriched along the miRNA se-
quences. Thus, our analysis was consistent with previous ﬁndings
that perfect canonical seed pairing is an important parameter for
miRNA target recognition.

Interestingly, 6-mers from all positions of the miRNA se-
quence were paired to the target sites at signiﬁcantly higher
rates as compared with the negative control (Fig. 1). In particu-
lar, 6-mers from two positions, nucleotides 4—9 and 5—10 were
the second and fourth most enriched, respectively, although they
fall outside the canonical seed region. Thus, nucleotides 4—10
were considered as the “extended” seed region in our analysis
as 6-mers from this region partly overlap with canonical seeds,
matching to the target sites at similarly high rates to canonical
seeds. Further, 6-mers from all other positions in the miRNA
sequence were also signiﬁcantly enriched, although to a lesser
extent as compared with canonical or extended 6-mer seeds
(Fig. 1). As shown in Table 1, perfect matches to canonical 6-
mer seeds were identiﬁed in 22.4% of all target sites, which was
6.8-fold enriched as compared with the shufﬂed control.
Similarly, 6-mers from the extended seed region were matched
to 20.9% of all target sites, which was 6.3-fold enriched. Seed

pairing was even more signiﬁcant when 7-mer seeds were con-
sidered, with 11.0- and 11.5-fold in enrichment for canonical and
extended seed regions, respectively. When 6-mers from both ca-
nonical and extended seed regions were considered collectively,
seed matches were found in 32.9% of all target sites. Thus, the
majority of the target sites did not have perfect pairing to any
miRNA seed even when both canonical and extended seeds were
considered.

Similar to perfect base pairing, G—U wobble pairs can also
provide thermostability in the RNA duplex. However, a G—U
mismatch in the seed region may potentially interfere with
target binding based on structural analysis (Bartel, 2009). The
impact of G—U mismatch on seed-target binding is still a debat-
able topic, as some studies suggested that the presence of a G—U
mismatch would mostly abolish the miRNA targeting ability,
while some other studies identiﬁed functional target sites with
G—U mismatch to the miRNA seed (Brodersen and Voinnet,
2009; Vella et al., 2004). This issue was revisited using the
CLASH data to analyse any 6-mer seed with a single G-U mis-
match to the target site. As shown in Table 1, there were signiﬁ-
cantly more 6-mers from both canonical and extended seed
regions, with 2.3- and 2.4-fold in enrichment, respectively, for
target pairing with a G—U mismatch as compared with the
shufﬂed control. Thus, our analysis indicated that imperfect
seed pairing with a G—U mismatch to the target site may still

be biologically relevant. However, the enrichment ratios were
much lower than those of perfect seed match, suggesting signiﬁ-
cantly less important role of G—U mismatched seed pairing in
miRNA target recognition. Furthermore, the impact of non-GU
mismatches was also examined. A 7-mer with an internal non-
GU mismatch was only slightly enriched in the target sites (1.3-
and 1.4-fold in enrichment, Table 1), indicating that a non-GU
internal mismatch in seed pairing would mostly abolish miRNA
target recognition. Combined together, 51.1% of all target sites
were paired perfectly to canonical/extended seeds, or imperfectly
with a G-U mismatch.

We further analysed the relevance of non-seed sequence of
miRNA in target recognition. Among all seed-pairing target
sites (9465 in total), 43.5% of them were also paired to non-
seed region of miRNA, which was a signiﬁcant enrichment
over shufﬂed control (Table 2). Furthermore, as to non-canon-
ical target sites without any seed match, 40.9% were paired to the
non-seed region of the miRNA. Thus, pairing to non-seed region
of the miRNA was a signiﬁcant feature for both canonical and
non-canonical targets.

3.2 GC content of miRNA seed was strongly correlated to
target recognition patterns

All 18 514 target sites from the CLASH dataset were analysed to
identify sequence features that characterized perfect seed pairing.

First, canonical 6-mer seeds, involving either positions 2—7 or
3—8, were characterized. Interestingly, there was a very strong
correlation between GC content and perfect pairing of 6-mer
seeds within the canonical region, with correlation coefﬁcients
(r) of 0.91 and 0.96 for nucleotides 2—7 and 3—8, respectively
(Fig. 2A and B). Few targets were paired to any canonical seed
when the GC content of the seed was low. On the other hand, a
much higher percentage of seed-pairing targets were found for
miRNAs with high GC content of the seed. GC content is com-
monly used to represent thermodynamic stability of RNA
duplex. Thus, the thermostability of seed-target binding was
also evaluated by calculating the free energy (AG) of seed-
target RNA duplex with RNAfold (Hofacker, 2003). As ex-
pected, the AG of seed-target duplex was strongly correlated
with the percentage of targets with seed pairing (r: —0.90 and
—0.95 for nucleotides 2—7 and 3—8, respectively; Fig. 2C and D).
Thus, seed-based target recognition was dependent on the ther-
mostability of seed pairing to the target site. For miRNAs with
weak canonical seed-pairing stability, non-canonical targeting
was the dominant mechanism for target recognition.

Besides targets involving canonical seed pairing, we also
analysed non-canonical targets including pairing to extended
seeds, imperfect pairing with a G—U mismatch or pairing to
non-seed sequences. Similar to canonical seed pairing, 6-mer
matches to the extended seed region (positions 4—10) were
strongly correlated to sequence GC content (r=0.99, Fig. 3A),
which reﬂected the stability of seed-target duplex as represented
by AG (r = —0.98, Fig. 3B). Combined together, the GC content
of both canonical and extended seeds within the full seed region
was a strong predictor of perfect seed pairing to the target site. In
addition to perfect seed pairing, imperfect seed pairing with a G-
U mismatch was also analysed. As shown in Figure 3C, low GC

content (550%) of the seed was also a signiﬁcant predictor of
poor seed pairing (r> 0.99). Interestingly, no such correlation
was observed when the GC content was higher (>50%).
Pairing between non-seed 6-mers in the miRNA sequence and
the target sites was also strongly dependent on the GC content of
the 6-mers, in a similar way to seed pairing of the target site
(r: 0.98, Fig. 3D). Thus, binding stability of the paired nucleo-
tides was a major determinant of miRNA targeting patterns,
whether involving seed or non-seed sequences.

3.3 Canonical and non-canonical targeting had similar
thermostability but distinct impacts on target
expression

Overall thermostability of the miRNA-target RNA duplex was
assessed for both canonical and non-canonical targeting pat-
terns. The following non-canonical target types were included
in the analysis: targets pairing to extended seed region, pairing
to non-seed region and with no pairing anywhere in the miRNA
sequence. These non-canonical targets were compared with ca-
nonical targets as well as randomly assigned non-target tran-
scripts from the CLASH dataset (shufﬂed control). Speciﬁcally,
overall distribution of thermostability for each type of target
binding, as represented by AG, was determined with RNAfold
(Hofacker, 2003). As shown in Figure 4, binding of miRNAs to
their cognate targets was signiﬁcantly more stable than binding
to randomly matched transcripts (P< 10_3°° with Student’s t-test
for all target types). The mean binding free energies were —24.6,
—24.8, —24.4 and —20.9kcal/mol for targets involving canonical

seed pairing, extended seed pairing, non-seed 6-mer pairing and
no pairing anywhere in the miRNA sequence, respectively. There
was no difference among the ﬁrst three target types, all of which
had signiﬁcantly lower free energy than the last type. In contrast,
binding between miRNAs and randomly matched transcripts
were much more unstable, with mean AG of —17.1 kcal/mol.

It was shown previously that binding of miRNA to the target
generally resulted in suppressed gene expression at both the tran-
scriptional and translational levels (Baek et al., 2008; Selbach
et al., 2008). However, most previous studies were focused on
canonical miRNA targeting involving perfect seed pairing, and
the impact of miRNA binding to non-canonical targets has not
been well characterized. In our analysis, the CLASH dataset was
combined with a public microarray dataset, which studied the
impact of concurrent depletion of 25 miRNAs on mRNA levels
in HEK 293 cells (Hafner et al., 2010). As negative control of the
analysis, each target transcript in the miRNA-target pairs from
the CLASH dataset was replaced by a randomly assigned non-
target transcript with similar expression level to the target as
determined by microarrays. Speciﬁcally, the expression differ-
ence between a target transcript and its random control was
<05 (log2-transformed expression value). Consistent with the
Hafner study, canonical targets with perfect seed pairing sites
were signiﬁcantly upregulated by miRNA depletion as compared
with the negative control (mean fold change of 0.044 and
P<10_17 by Student’s t-test, Fig. 5A). In contrast, all three
types of non-canonical targets were upregulated only moderately
as compared with the negative control. The mean fold changes
for individual non-canonical target types were in the range of
0.014 to 0.021 and P-values in the range of 0.003 to 0.0002. Thus,
miRNA binding to target transcripts led to distinctively different

Fig. 5. Impact on target gene expression was dependent on miRNA tar-
geting patterns. The following target groups were considered: targets
matching to at least one canonical 6-mer seed, but not to any extended
seed; targets not matching to any canonical seed, but to at least one 6-mer
extended seed; target not matching to any type of seed, but to at least one
6-mer in the non-seed region; targets with no 6-mer match anywhere in
the miRNA sequence. A cumulative distribution of targets in relation to
gene expression changes was presented for each target type. (A) Target
mRNA expression changes resulting from simultaneous depletion of 25
miRNAs (Hafner et al., 2010). As negative control, the cognate target
sequence was replaced by a randomly assigned transcript sequence for
miRNA pairing analysis (shufﬂed control). (B) Target protein expression
changes resulting from individually overexpressing ﬁve miRNAs (Selbach
et al., 2008). All 330 miRNA-target pairs present in both the proteomic
and CLASH datasets were included in the analysis of different miRNA
targeting patterns. As negative control, the cognate target protein was
replaced by a randomly assigned protein from the proteomic dataset
(shufﬂed control)

transfected into HeLa cells and changes in protein synthesis due
to miRNA overexpression were determined by proteomic stu-
dies. In our analysis, different miRNA targeting types were eval-
uated with this proteomic dataset. Speciﬁcally, all miRNA-target
pairs from the CLASH dataset were cross-checked with the
proteomic dataset, and 330 common miRNA-target pairs pre-
sented in both datasets were identiﬁed. From these identiﬁed
pairs, different miRNA targeting patterns were correlated to
changes in target protein expression due to overexpression of
individual miRNAs. As shown in Figure 5B, canonical targets
with perfect 6-mer seed match were signiﬁcantly suppressed by
miRNA overexpression (mean fold change of —0.114 and
P: 0.0004 by comparing with the negative control by
Student’s t-test). In contrast, none of the other miRNA targeting
patterns were signiﬁcantly associated with suppression of target
protein expression (mean fold change ranging from —0.027 to
0.001 and P-values ranging from 0.36 to 0.87 by Student’s t-test).

4 DISCUSSION

Multiple experimental strategies have been established to identify
both miRNAs and target transcripts that are bound to the RISC
complex (Chi et al., 2009; Hafner et al., 2010). However, one
major challenge of these strategies is that RNA sequences were
identiﬁed after pooling miRNAs and target transcripts from all
RICS complexes together, which represents a many-to-many re-
lationship for miRNAs and their targets. Thus, information
about speciﬁc miRNA-target pairs in each RISC complex was
unknown. Although multiple computational algorithms were
proposed recently for prediction of miRNA-target pairs from
CLIP data (Khorshid et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Reczko
et al., 2012), the most straightforward and reliable way would
be to directly identify miRNA-target pairs experimentally. Using
the CLASH method, Helwak et al. (2013) identiﬁed thousands of
speciﬁc miRNA-target transcript pairs that were bound to the
same RISC complexes. Their work presented an unprecedented
opportunity to study miRNA target recognition patterns, espe-
cially those involving non-canonical target sites.

Most previous miRNA target analyses were focused on target
sites pairing to canonical miRNA seed region. The CLASH data
indicate that many targets are not paired to any canonical
miRNA seed. In fact, canonical miRNA targets represented
only 22% of all targets in the CLASH dataset (Table 1).
However, it was not clear why canonical or non-canonical tar-
gets were preferentially associated with certain miRNAs. A
major novelty of this work is the identiﬁcation of sequence de-
terminants for miRNA-to-miRNA variability in target recogni-
tion patterns. Speciﬁcally, sequence features related to miRNA
seed composition were identiﬁed that distinguish canonical
miRNA targeting from non-canonical targeting. Our previous
work on a limited number of miRNAs (Nelson et al., 2011)
suggested that there is signiﬁcant miRNA-to-miRNA variability
associated with target recognition patterns. Interestingly, re-
analysis of the CLASH data containing a large number of
miRNAs revealed that composition of the miRNA seed sequence
was strongly correlated to targeting patterns. For miRNAs with
weak seed binding stability, they recognized target transcripts
mostly through non-canonical mechanisms without involving ca-
nonical seed pairing. Thus, the current work suggested that

variability in seed sequence composition resulted in variable
miRNA-dependent targeting patterns, and this seed variability
issue should be taken into consideration when predicting targets
for individual miRNAs. To this end, we are currently working on
incorporating the seed composition feature into an improved
target prediction algorithm for more accurate prediction of sup-
pression of target gene expression.

Overall, non-canonical targeting was the norm rather than
exception when all miRNAs were considered collectively.
However, the functional consequences of miRNA targeting
were dependent on target recognition patterns. Canonical target-
ing, involving perfect pairing to the canonical seed region, gen-
erally led to signiﬁcant downregulation of target transcripts. In
contrast, only marginal transcriptional downregulation was
observed for non-canonical types of targets based on microarray
analysis (Fig. 5A). Similarly, canonical targeting, but not any
other targeting type, led to signiﬁcant suppression of target pro-
tein expression based on proteomic analysis (Fig. 5B). Thus, our
target expression analysis agrees with previous observations that
miRNAs typically suppress target expression at both the tran-
scriptional and translational levels (Baek et al., 2008; Guo et al.,
2010; Hendrickson et al., 2009; Selbach et al., 2008). Consistent
with our analysis, previous experimental studies demonstrated
that miRNAs with weak seed binding stability had low proﬁ-
ciency on target downregulation (Didiano and Hobert, 2006;
Garcia et al., 2011), which can be explained by our prediction
that most targets of these miRNAs were of non-canonical type
whose expression was not effectively impacted by miRNA
binding.

The target-type dependency for gene expression regulation
raised an interesting question as to what constitutes an effective
miRNA target. Non-canonical targets were bound by miRNA
and this binding could be functionally important in ways other
than direct target downregulation. For example, non-canonical
targets may serve as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) to
sequester miRNAs from regulating canonical targets (Salmena
et al., 2011). If this is the case, non-canonical targets could
behave more like a reservoir of ‘miRNA regulators’, rather
than targets of miRNA. Thus, it is likely that concurrent inter-
actions between miRNAs and canonical/non-canonical targets
are important to maintain the steady state of gene expression
regulation networks mediated by miRNAs.

Abstract

Summary: Visualizing genes’ structure and annotated features helps biologists to investigate their
function and evolution intuitively. The Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS) has been widely used
by more than 60 000 users since its first publication in 2007. Here, we reported the upgraded GSDS
2.0 with a newly designed interface, supports for more types of annotation features and formats,
as well as an integrated visual editor for editing the generated figure. Moreover, a user—specified
phylogenetic tree can be added to facilitate further evolutionary analysis. The full source code is
also available for downloading.

Availability and implementation: Web server and source code are freely available at http://gsds.

1 Introduction

The visualization of gene features such as composition and position
of exons and introns for genes offers visual presentation for biolo—
gists to integrate annotation, and also helps them to produce high—
quality figures for publication. Thus, several web servers/software
including FancyGene (Rambaldi and Ciccarelli, 2009), GECA
(Fawal et al., 2012), FeatureStack (Frech et al., 2012), GSDraw
(Wang et al., 2013), GPViz (Snajder et al., 2013) and GenePainter
(Hammesfahr et al., 2013) have been developed recently. Designing
to generate high—quality figures suitable for publication, we de—
veloped an online Gene Structure Display Server (GSDS) (Guo et al.,
2007), which supported three input formats including sequences,
accession number of GenBank (Benson et al., 2013) and exon
positions. With more than 1 million hits annually, GSDS has been

widely used by world—wide scientists in the functional (Ye et al.,
2009; Wang et al., 2010) and evolutionary study (Hu et al., 2010;
Yin et al., 2009; Yu et al., 2009) of gene families.

According to the feedbacks from GSDS users, we developed the
upgraded GSDS 2.0. Compared with the previous version, GSDS 2.0
supports two more widely used annotation formats, providing more
comprehensive support for annotation files. To aid biologists generat—
ing suitable figures for publication, GSDS 2.0 offers a powerful inter—
active interface. Users can customize the size, shape and color of
annotation features after their initial render and even fine—tune each
element through an integrated visual editor. To facilitate evolutionary
analysis, a user—specified phylogenetic tree can be added to the figure.
Finally, the generated figure can be exported as either vector graphic
(in SVG and PDF format), or raster graphic (in PNG format).

Fig. 1. The work flow of GSDS 2.0 (A) and the generated figure (B). A user-
specified phylogenetic tree (B1) could be added to the main canvas (B2).
Meanwhile, the users can adjust the size, shape and color of all features (B3),
rescale introns (B4), as well as edit generated figure interactively (BS)

2 Usage and implementation

Based on feedbacks from users of GSDS 1.0, we upgraded GSDS to
version 2.0 with a newly designed interface and several novel func—
tions (Fig. 1):

1. More types of annotation features and formats are supported. In
addition to GenBank ID and FASTA sequences, GSDS 2.0 also
supports commonly used formats including BED, GTF and
GFF3. Moreover, extra features such as conserved elements and
binding sites can also be uploaded and displayed along with the
main features (‘Region 2’ in Fig. 1B).

2. The generated ﬁgures can be further modiﬁed by users. With the
purpose to generate suitable, high—quality ﬁgures for publication,
GSDS 2.0 provides types of functionality on their further modiﬁ-
cation (Fig. 1B). By setting the parameters on the result page
(‘Region 3’ in Fig. 1B), users can turn on/off the display of speci—
ﬁed features and adjust their size, shape and color. Intron lengths
can also be rescaled to display large introns properly (‘Region 4’
in Fig. 1B). Moreover, the generated ﬁgure can be sent to a built—
in online SVG editor for further modiﬁcation interactively after
clicking the ‘Edit ﬁgure interactively’ button (‘Region 5’ in
Fig. 1B).

3. According to the published works using original GSDS 1.0,
a large proportion of analyzes have been targeted on the evolu—
tionary study of gene structures. Thus, we implemented a

dedicated panel for users to specify a phylogenetic tree for dis—
play side—by—side with the main canvas (‘Region 1’ in Fig. 1B).

Compared with similar tools, GSDS 2.0 shows superiors in both
the supports for input/output formats, usability and availability
(Supplementary Table S1).

3 Further directions

We have updated our GSDS to version 2.0, which supports more
types of features and feature describing formats, as well as further
modification on the generated figures. By analyzing the usage of
GSDS and feedbacks from users, we will continue our efforts to up—
date GSDS to better serve this community.

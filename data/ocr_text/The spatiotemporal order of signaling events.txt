Abstract

Motivation: Animals from worms and insects to birds and mammals show distinct body plans;
however, the embryonic development of diverse body plans with tissues and organs within is con—
trolled by a surprisingly few signaling pathways. It is well recognized that combinatorial use of and
dynamic interactions among signaling pathways follow specific logic to control complex and accur—
ate developmental signaling and patterning, but it remains elusive what such logic is, or even,
what it looks like.

Results: We have developed a computational model for Drosophila eye development with innovated
methods to reveal how interactions among multiple pathways control the dynamically generated hex—
agonal array of R8 cells. We obtained two novel findings. First, the coupling between the long—range in—
ductive signals produced by the proneural Hh signaling and the short—range restrictive signals pro—
duced by the antineural Notch and EGFR signaling is essential for generating accurately spaced R83.
Second, the spatiotemporal orders of key signaling events reveal a robust pattern of lateral inhibition
conducted by Ato—coordinated Notch and EGFR signaling to collectively determine R8 patterning. This
pattern, stipulating the orders of signaling and comparable to the protocols of communication, may
help decipher the well—appreciated but poorly defined logic of developmental signaling.

1 Introduction

 

In developing cells, cascades of signaling events are believed to fol—
low specific logic to make several evolutionarily conserved signaling
pathways control the patterning of numerous phenotypically distinct
body plans. At the genomic level, the DNA sequence encodes rich
logic that accurately determines the conditions each gene is turned
ON and OFF (Istrail and Davidson, 2005). Above this level, it is
argued that ‘the heart of the matter (developmental signaling) is not
so much the individual molecules involved, but more the ﬂow of in—
formation and the logic of the system they participate in’ (Lawrence
and Struhl, 1996), but this logic has never been clearly defined. Such
logic is essential for ultimately deciphering morphogenesis and

morphological evolution (Carroll, 2008). Integrating protein—protein
interactions into complicated maps simply makes dynamic signaling
deceptively complex without revealing spatiotemporal information
of interactions (Guruharsha et 61]., 2011). Many researchers build
models and compute molecular concentrations, and upon which
infer signaling events and their spatiotemporal orders in cells. But
such inference is difficult, error—prone and inaccurate in nature, es—
pecially when crosstalk occurs dynamically among pathways in rap-
idly patterning cells.

Drosopbila eye development, controlled by signaling among
equipotential cells and producing a striking cellular pattern, has
been used to uncover the logic of developmental signaling (Freeman,

1997). The patterning of about 800 hexagonally arrayed photo—
receptor 8 (R8) cells is the first step of eye development controlled
by signaling among proneural genes, antineural genes and conserved
signaling pathways. These genes and pathways together form mul—
tiple spatiotemporally closed feedbacks, controlling the accurate
and moving process of R8 patterning.

Despite intensive studies of these proneural genes, antineural
genes and Hh/Notch/EGFIUDpp/W/nt pathways in R8 patterning in
the past three decades (excellently reviewed in (Frankfort and
Mardon, 2002)), the quantitative and dynamic picture of the self—
sustained signaling that drives the morphogenetic furrow (MF)
movement and R8 patterning remains absent. Intensive crosstalk
among these genes and pathways makes it difficult to unveil the pic—
ture experimentally. Instead, to integrate experimental findings into
a computational model to examine how the fine—grained and accur—
ate organogenesis is performed is valuable for unfolding the spatio—
temporally orchestrated signaling process. Recently, Lubensky et al.
(2011) developed a concise model containing four equations to
simulate the striped pattern of R8 specification, upon which they
suggested that the dynamics of positive induction play a central role
in the selection of certain cells as R8s and that R8s are defined be—
fore the appearance of the complete group of proneural cells. Their
results are quite different from what experimental studies revealed,
and no signaling events in R8 patterning were examined (Lubensky
et al., 2011). In fact, in conventional computational studies, the
logic of signaling has never been explicitly defined and addressed.

Here, we describe a model consisting of the master proneural
gene ato (abbreviations of genes are in Supplementary Table S1) and
key components (ligands, receptors and effectors) in the Hh, EGFR,
Notch and Dpp pathways. The model combines the differential
equation formulation and the handling of signaling events, aiming
to define and decipher the logic of developmental signaling that con-
trols R8 patterning in particular, and other morphogenetic events in
general. We obtained two novel findings. First, the coupling between
the long—range inductive signals produced by the proneural Hh sig—
naling and the short—range restrictive signals produced by the anti—
neural Notch and EGFR signaling is essential for generating
accurately spaced R8s. Second, the spatiotemporal orders of key sig-
naling events reveal a robust pattern of lateral inhibition conducted
by Ato—coordinated Notch and EGFR signaling to collectively deter—
mine R8 patterning. These findings, unreported before, help unveil
the logic of developmental signaling, and may make computational
(and even experimental) researchers further examine the order and
disorder of cell signaling.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Model formulation and simulation

Upon intensive literature review we integrated well—accepted experi—
mental findings on Drosophila eye development into a concise
model that covers key components in the Hh/Notch/EGFIUDpp
pathways (Fig. 1). To make the model in a reasonable size, the com—
plex MAP kinase pathway, for example, is represented by only one
reaction from EGF receptor to the activated MAPK. In the 2—dimen-
sional cell space (50 X 50 and 100 X 100) each cell is a system of 42
mathematical equations, and dX/dt means dX[,-,,-]/dt with [1,1] indi—
cating cell’s position. Initial conditions of equations provide the ini—
tial signals to drive signaling (Fig. 1). Equations in all cells were
solved simultaneously using the second—order Runge—Kutta method
with adaptive time steps. We adopted very simple initial conditions
(Supplementary Methods), confirming that the model does not rely

on specific initial conditions. Since this is a non-dimensionalized
model, time period does not indicate true time. When new R8s are
determined, equations in old R8s (actually in all cells) are still being
solved, with molecular concentrations at stable levels and some
events continually occurring to make the R8 fate maintained.
Nonlinearity of gene expression and molecular interactions is
described by Hill functions in equations. Parameters were deter—
mined upon (i) experimental evidence, (ii) deep exploration of con—
straints among interacting molecules, (iii) some general properties of
mRNAs and proteins and (iv) tuning the model to produce the cor—
rect R8 arrays.

Fig. 1. Ato-coordinated Hh, Dpp, Notch and EGFR signaling during R8 pattern-
ing. (A) Hh secretion and diffusion drives the anterior (leftward) move of Hh
signaling and R8 patterning. Anteriorly diffused Hh causes CiA accumulation,
which activates ato in cells anterior to the inhibitory Ro domain (green areas
in inset) produced by the last column of (posterior) R8s. Ato induces sea in
proneural cells (the dark center of shadowed blue areas) and delta in more
cells (shadowed blue areas) to restrain and activate Notch signaling respect-
ively, and induces rho in R8 precursors to activate EGFR/MAPK signaling.
EGFR signaling first activates r0 in non-R8 cells and later hh in R2/R5 cells.
Thus, the Ato-EGFR-Hh-Ato feedback drives the posterior-to-anterior (right-
to-left) moving of Hh signaling and R8 fate determination. In the inset R, P1,
P2 and 1 indicate the R8 precursor, proneural cells and intervening cells. (B)

prevents CiA from degrading to the negative CiR. Accumulated CiA induces
ato and dpp expression in cells within and anterior to the MF, but is degraded
by HIB in cells posterior to the MF. HIB expression is induced by CiA but
quickly reaches self-activation, forming a CiA-HlB-CiA negative feedback. Ato
induces Rho directly (which represses r0) and Ro indirectly via Rho and EGFR
signaling and a diffusible inhibitory factor (Inf, with X as its putative receptor)
downstream to EGFR

2.2 Definition and capture of signaling events

When protein A’s concentration reaches the half—maximal activa—
tion/repression coefficient in the Hill function describing how A
nonlinearly activates/represses B (a protein or a gene), A sends the
message activation or repression to B, which is captured as A_Act_B
or A_Rep_B. Upon experimental studies, ligand—receptor binding
shows unclear or lesser nonlinearity than transcriptional activation/
repression and protein activation/repression by phosphorylation.
Lacking clear evidence whether ligand—receptor binding happens at
particular concentrations, binding events may not be defined opti—
mally. For an event determined upon several other events, it is
defined upon the logic relationship of the related events
(Supplementary Methods). Some events, such as Ato_Act_/olo_0_p1,
represent several steps of signaling occurred in or between cells.
Defined events (Supplementary Table S2) are captured in each and
every cell during simulations. Definition and capture of events and
numeric solution of equations were facilitated by a program (avail—
able upon request) developed for multi—cellular modeling (Zhu
et al., 2005).

3 Results

3.1 The long—range Hh signaling and the short—range
Notch and EGFR signaling form the core system

for R8 patterning

As multiple genes and pathways participate in R8 patterning, our
first question is what comprises the core signaling system. According
to experimental studies, Wnt signaling is dispensable for R8 pattern—
ing in eye discs central area. Upon literature review and the examin—
ation of different model components, we found that the master
proneural gene ato and about 20 genes and their products in the Hh/
Notch/EGFIUDpp pathways form the most parsimonious model of
R8 patterning (Fig. 1). Ato and the Hh/EGFIUNotch pathways suf—
fice to generate R8 arrays even when parameters vary considerably.
Since the anteriorly diffused Hh (secreted by R2/R5 cells in pat—
terned ommatidia) first activates the positive feedback between CiA
accumulation and Ptc expression and then allows the increased CiA
to activate ato expression (Chen et al., 1999; Strutt and Mlodzik,
1996), the long-range Hh signaling triggers the proneural fate in
most cells in a band of cells ahead of the MF. Subsequently, Ato trig—
gers the short—range Notch and EGFR signaling in these cells to spa—
tially restrict ato expression firstly into proneural cells and finally
into R8 cells (NICD and Ro inhibit ato expression) (Fig. 1). These
simulated processes match experimental observations very well
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Simulations suggest that, to dynamically
generate the subtle R8 pattern, Ato activity is essential to spatiotem—
porally coordinate the long—range and short—range signaling systems
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Dpp signaling is reported to promote CiA
accumulation, and thus, to accelerate MF movement (Fu and Baker,
2003). Simulations suggest that Dpp signaling has two opposite
effects—while MadA promotes CiA accumulation, it also negatively
affects the process, because an expanded CiA domain also causes an
expanded Ptc domain which would significantly increase Hh
consumption. This finding may explain why Dpp signaling only
slightly accelerates MF movement.

3.2 Signaling events elucidate discrete steps of cell

fate determination

Next we addressed the properties of the core signaling system, es—
pecially, the generated signaling events. It is experimentally
observed that ato is widely up—regulated initially in all cells in the

MF, then down—regulated firstly in intervening cells (I cells) and fi-
nally in all proneural cells except R8 (Frankfort and Mardon,
2002) (Fig. 1), but the timing and order of signaling events remain
unknown. Simulations reveal how R8 fate is determined by two
positive events, CiA_Act_ato and Ato_Act_ato, together with two
negative events, NI CD_Rep_ato and Ro_Rep_ato. We examined
these events in cells during different columns of R8 patterning.
Computed molecular concentrations and captured signaling events
show that ato is induced earliest by CiA_Act_ato in the R8 precur—
sor (which is closest to the sources of Hh but is beyond the action
of Ro_Rep_ato produced by cells posterior to the MF), and then in
proneural cells (Fig. 1; Supplementary Fig. S1). Sca, induced by
high Ato, binds to Notch on the R8 precursor and blocks Notch
signaling within. Delta, widely induced by ato expression, binds to
Notch on neighboring cells and activates Notch signaling in these
cells (Powell et al., 2001). The low Sca in the P1/P2/I cells, diffused
from the R8 precursor and/or produced locally, does not effect—
ively block Notch signaling and prevent NI CD_Rep_ato in these
cells. Later, since the I cells are beyond the scope of SpiA but
within the scope of the inhibitory factor Inf (Baonza et al., 2001),
there is Ro_Rep_ato but no ngrB_Act_MAPK in these cells. The
spatiotemporally ordered events of Notch/EGFR signaling in these
cells, in the background of the Hh gradient and the R0 domain,
provide a mechanistic explanation for computed molecular con—
centrations and experimentally observed cell fate determination.
Notably, while molecular concentrations look the same in different
columns of R8, signaling events (especially events of Dpp and Hh
signaling) show variations (Figs 2 and 3), which reveal a noticeable
aspect of developmental signaling and patterning. Simulations sug-
gest that, for correct R8 spacing, an adequate time interval be—
tween EGFR and Hh activation is required to allow EGFR
signaling and Ro distribution to become stable when a new round
of ato expression is activated.

3.3 Notch/EGFR signaling forms concerted

lateral inhibition

Notch signaling is ubiquitously used in embryogenesis by cells that
acquire (or are about to acquire) a particular fate to stop their neigh—
bors from acquiring the same fate. Notch and Delta signaling thus
implements a lateral inhibition mechanism that acts between directly
connecting cells, which has been examined intensively (Collier,
1996; Webb and Owen, 2004). How inhibition happens in cells not
directly connected is less examined and poorly understood. While
EGFR signaling regulates Ato levels in cells within an ommatidium
(Chen and Chien, 1999), it is difficult to determine experimentally
the relative order of Ato_Act_ato and Ato_Act_r/oo, or whether rho
is activated before a cell obtains the R8 fate, and therefore, when
EGFR signaling begins to regulate R8 patterning (Spencer et al.,
1998). Simulations indicate that Ato_Act_r/oo should happen before
Ato_Act_ato (taAto_r/oo:0.35 and taAto_ato:0.45, the param—
eter setting taAto_r/oo < taAto_ato enables Ato_Act_r/oo to happen
earlier than Ato_Act_ato) and that increasing or decreasing
taAto_r/oo by 50% (which would cause a delayed or precocious
Ato_Act_r/oo) makes R8 patterning fail after 3 or 4 rounds of R8
patterning. These results suggest that Notch and EGFR signaling,
activated by Ato at different time points (taAto_delta:0.01 and
taAto_r/oo:0.35), forms concerted lateral inhibition to regulate
competitive R8 determination (Baonza et al., 2001; Dokucu et al.,
1996; Powell et al., 2001). Given that R0 is activated by EGFR via a
hypothesized diffusible inhibitory factor (Baonza et al., 2001),
NI CD_Rep_ato and Ro_Rep_ato act in different spatial scope and

temporal stage (Ro_Rep_ato occurs slightly later in more cells,
including in R8 precursors for a short time, see Figs 2 and 3), with a
proper timing, on ato. Since Ato—activated Notch and EGFR signal—
ing also acts in the development of chordotonal sense organ precur—
sors (Zur Lage and Jarman, 2000), it is sensible to infer that they
combine to make robust lateral inhibition in a large group of cells
for competitive cell fate determination.

3.4 R8 patterning is robust to changes in some
signaling events

Since the spatiotemporal restraint of ato expression by Notch and
EGFR signaling is essential for R8 determination, we compared the
impact of changed Ato_Act_r/oo and NI CD_Rep_ato, two events in
the R8 cells, on R8 determination. We made the two events happen
earlier and later by decreasing and increasing their controlling par-
ameters taAto_r/oo and trNICD_ato by 5 0%. Notably, the changed
NI CD_Rep_ato did not affect R8 patterning (trNICD_ato :
0.003—>0.0015), or just made the fifth column of R8 slightly more
posterior (closer to the previous column of R8s) (trNICD_ato:
0.003—>0.0045) (Fig. 3A—E). Similarly, the changed Ato_Act_r/oo
did not affect R8 patterning until the forth column of R8
(taAtO_7’]’JO : 0.35—>0.175) (Fig. 3F—I). In this case, EGFR and
Notch signaling was seen to become gradually, instead of immedi—
ately, decoupled (Fig. 3]). R8 patterning of fifth to eighth columns
can be recovered when taAto_r/oo : 0.35 —>0.175 is corrected (akin
to rescue of a mutation in ato) at an early time (t = 400), but cannot
if taAto_r/oo : 0.35—>0.175 is corrected at a late time (t: 450). The
corrected parameter changes the timing and order of Notch/EGFR
signaling events (Fig. 3K).

Robust developmental patterning can be generated by properties
of signaling such as positive and negative feedbacks, and by redun—
dancy in signaling as evidenced by multiple antineural genes
involved in R8 patterning. So far, robustness of a computational
model is measured by the model’s sensitivity to changes in param—
eters (von Dassow et al., 2000). Nevertheless, changes in parameters
do not necessarily, or do not in a simple way, cause changes in sig—
naling events (Zhu and Mao, 2015). To examine the sensitivity of
R8 patterning to changes in signaling events, we captured events in
successive rounds of R8 patterning. The results indicate that signal-
ing events show round—to—round variations and the correct R8 pat—
tern was generated robustly despite significant changes in the
timing, order and occurrence of some events (Fig. 2). As described
above, the model can also buffer the impact of changed parameters
to delay the occurrence of changed or erroneous events. These re—
sults, for the first time, reveal a new dimension of robustness of de—
velopmental signaling, which is impressive in R8 patterning and
may be ubiquitous in developmental patterning.

3.5 The spatiotemporal orders of key events show a
specific pattern of signaling in cells

Developmental patterning is controlled by an array of tissue—specific
selector genes together with a few evolutionarily conserved signaling
pathways (Affolter and Mann, 2001). In developmental biology, a
fundamental question is to what extent does developmental signal—
ing share intrinsic commons. To explore the properties of the Ato—
coordinated Hh, EGFR and Notch signaling, apart from tdAtO_1’]’JO,
taAto_ato and taAto_delta, we further increased and decreased the
value of 39 other parameters by 5 0% and examined the impact of

Fig. 3. Impact of changed parameters and changed events on R8 patterning. (A—E) are distributions of Rho, Sca, SpiA, X3 and Ato concentration, respectively, at
some time steps under trNICD_ato= 0.003—>0.0045. For comparisons, (B’) and (C’) are distributions of Sca and SpiA concentration at the same time steps under
the default condition. This change of trNICD_ato causes ectopic (more posterior) ato expression (indicated by ectopic Rho at t: 588 in (A)), influences Notch sig-
naling (indicated by Sca at t=786 in (B)) and influences EGFR signaling (indicated by SpiA at t=786 in (C)). New R83 are generated, but with a defect (indicated
by X3 and Ato at t: 860 in (D) and (E)). (F—l) are distributions of SpiA, CiA, ato and SpiA concentration at different time steps under taAto_rho= 0.35—>0.175. For
comparisons, (F’), (G’) and (l’) are distributions of SpiA, CiA and SpiA at the same time steps under the default condition. This change of taAto_rho activates rho
expression and EGFR signaling earlier (indicated by SpiA at t: 307 in (F)). The change also influences Hh signaling via Ato (indicated by CiA at t: 371 in (G)), ar-
rests R8 generation (indicated by ato at t: 426 in (H)) and influences EGFR signaling (indicated by SpiA at t: 475 in (l)). (J) The sequences of some events in the
case taAto-rho=0.35—>0.175. [40,40] and [39,37] indicates cell position; events (as numbered in Supplementary Table 82, and ordered left-to-right) without and
with an underline indicate the initiation and stop of the events; circled events are critical ones and follow rigorous orders. In R8 cells ([40,40], [34,35], [28,40],
[22,35] at the left side) the order of events appears the same as that under the default condition (compare the marked 7, 5, 26, 30 with those in Fig. 2), but in the 1
cells ([39,37], [33,32], [27,37], [21,32] at the right side), the occurrence of the event NICD_Rep_ato is gradually postponed and the activation of r0 becomes rela-
tively earlier (see the marked 40, 30 in these cells). (K) When taAto_rho= 0.35—>0.175 is corrected at t: 400 (indicated by * with an arrow), all columns of R8 are
generated, but a correction made at t: 450 is not successful, because it is too late to correct the subsequent EGFR signaling and r0 expression. Events 7, 5, 26, 30
shown in the two R8 cells ([28,40] and [22,35]), and events 40, 30 shown in the two 1 cells ([27,37] and [15,37]), follow the correct order, but the timing and their

positions in the event sequences are different

these changes on R8 patterning. In many cases (40 out of 78) R8
patterning remained successful. In the cases where R8 patterning
was wrong, changes often did not cause immediate failure of R8 pat—
terning; instead, one or two columns of R8 were generated before
failure occurred (14 out of 38). These indicate that the Hh/Notch/
EGFIUDpp signaling as modeled here is rather robust against par—
ameter changes. We then analyzed the sequences of signaling events
produced by the 78 simulations. In all cases, as long as a column of
R8 was generated, events of Notch/EGFR signaling in the R8 show
a specific order—Ato_Act_sca, Ato_Act_r/oo, ngrB_Act_MAPK
and XB_Ato_ro. Moreover, as long as the order of these events
occurred in a cell, the cell became R8. The correspondence between

the R8 fate and the order of these events, regardless of changes in
the timing, order and occurrence of other events caused by
parameter changes, may reveal an important property of the Ato—
coordinated Hh/Notch/EGFIUDpp signaling in R8 patterning. Such
orders of signaling in and between cells are comparable to protocols
of communication (such as TCP/IP) in and between computers; both
stipulate orderly transmission of information.

In the R8 cells, as CiA_Act_ato is not repressed by Notch and
EGFR signaling, the self—sustained Ato expression (event 2) occurs
at the correct time following event 7, 5 and 26 and marks R8 fate
(Fig. 4). In the proneural cell P1 and the intervening cell I, key events
of Notch/EGFR also show specific orders. Unique to the P1 cell is

Fig. 4. The sequences of events in an R8 cell, a P1 cell and an I cell during R8 patterning. In all panels, R, P and l indicate the R8 cell, the P1 cell and the | cell (see in-
set in Fig. 1). Events are numbered as in Supplementary Table 82 and ordered left-to-right. Columns help display the order of events but do not contain time infor-

mation. Multiple numbers in a unit (and those with ‘*' in two units) indicate concurrent events. Events without and with an underline indicate the initiation and
stop of the events. Red numbers indicate key Notch/EGFR signaling events. The self-sustained Ato expression (event 2) follows event 7, 5 and 26 and marks the
R8 fate. Notch and EGFR signaling, by repressing Ato expression in other cells, a||ows Ato_EXp_ato to occur only in R8 cells. Red events, together with event 2,
are key events that make a cell R8, and they show specific orders in these cells in successful R8 patterning (A, B), but do not in unsuccessful R8 patterning (C, D).
In non-R8 cells (and failed R8 cells), sequences of events vary more significantly as signaling is less constrained (note that the fate of these cells is undetermined
at the moment of R8 determination). (A) With the default parameter setting, R8 patterning is correct. (B) With taAto_de/ta=0.005, R8 patterning is correct. (C)
With taXB_ro= 0.00825, R8 patterning fails. (D) With baseptc= 0.06, R8 patterning fails

the order NI CD_Rep_ato, ngrB_Act_MAPK and XB_Ato_ro,
lacking Ato_Act_sca and Ato_Act_r/oo; and unique to the I cell is
the order NI CD_Rep_ato and XB_Ato_ro, further lacking
ngrB_Act_MAPK (Fig. 4). Generally, in non-R8 cells where signal-
ing is less constrained sequences of events are more varied. In failed
or wrong R8 patterning, these orders are disrupted in these cells,
indicating that concerted Notch/EGFR signaling follows a specific
spatiotemporal pattern in multiple cells. From these results we hy—
pothesize that such orders and patterns may intrinsically character-
ize the concerted lateral inhibition conducted by Notch/EGFR
signaling, for R8 patterning in particular and for competitive cell
fate determination in general (Culi et al., 2001; Hajnal et al., 1997).

4. Discussion

4.1 A note on parameter settings and captured events

We chose Drosophila eye development to explore the logic of devel—
opmental signaling because Drosophila eye development is the most
studied, best characterized and remarkably accurate developmental
patterning process, no other process provides more or better data
for systematic and quantitative investigations targeting coordinated
pathway interactions. It allows us to determine parameters upon
abundant experimental reports and to explore vast constraints
among parameters (Supplementary Methods). For such a complex
model, the chance of accidentally producing the subtle R8 array
with parameters in unreasonable ranges is extremely small. Our con—
clusions are upon signaling events under varied orders but not

molecular concentrations, and are therefore independent of specific
parameter values. For a small model it may be preferable to build it
upon a specifically designed experiment with parameters being ac—
curately measured; but for a large one it is only feasible to build it
upon abundant experimental findings with parameters being reason—
ably estimated and rigorously tested.

A question is whether it is meaningful, or possible, that event se—
quences in different R8 cells are somewhat different. Functionally
redundant signaling components and feedbacks, parallel activities of
multiple pathways, intrinsic stochasticity of gene expression, ﬂuctu—
ation of molecular concentrations and tissue specific environments
all make it possible for molecular interaction to generate different
event sequences in different cells, including cells obtaining the same
fate at different times and different places. Li et al., using a com—
pletely different method, revealed that a yeast cell can undergo dif—
ferent state transition pathways to fall into an attractor and the
pathway is robust against small perturbations (Li et al., 2004); this
equals to that a cell undergoes different molecular interaction events
to reach a stable state (including to enter into its final fate as we
examine here). Also comparable to their finding that it is very un—
likely for a sequence of events to deviate from the cell—cycle path—
way, we explicitly demonstrate that the order of key events is highly
robust. Thus, events and orders of events may be better than mol—
ecule concentrations for unveiling properties of signaling.

It is well justified to define and model nonlinear molecular inter-
actions (such as protein activation and repression by phosphoryl-
ation) as a series of events (Naldi et al., 2009) or logic—like

operations (Li et al., 2004), but to what extent ligand—receptor bind—
ing is nonlinear is less clear. The way we define ligand—receptor
binding may not be optimal, which may inﬂuence not only the tim—
ing, duration and occurrence of binding events per se but also event
sequences as a whole. This may, to some extent, explain the vari-
ation of inessential events in silico and in vivo. Another question is
whether changes of events (for example, a delayed or absent
A_Act_B) observed in simulations occur in vivo. In the model, if a
protein’s concentration does not reach the defined threshold for it to
interact with its target, the defined event does not occur; this does
not necessarily mean that the event would be absent in vivo.
Nevertheless, upon the widely accepted mass—action rule, the ab—
sence of A_Act_B due to low concentration of A indicates that
A_Act_B would occur for a shorter period in vivo and thereby inﬂu—
ence the sequence and order of related events. Thus, simulated se—
quences and orders of events indeed reasonably reﬂect in vivo
situations.

4.2 Potential missing regulators of Notch signaling

Ato induces the expression of two Notch ligands, the membrane—teth—
ered Delta and the diffusible Sca. Delta/Notch binding produces
NICD but Sca/Notch binding, with a higher affinity, just stabilizes
Notch (Baker and Yu, 1998; Lee et al., 1996; Powell et al., 2001). As
Sca is only observed in proneural cells, it is suggested that cells ex—
pressing high levels of Ato express Sca to repress Notch signaling in
proneural cells (Powell et al., 2001). We tried a range of values for the
two parameters (taAto_delta and taAto_sca) that control the activa—
tion of delta and sea by Ato. A relatively small taAto_sca resulted in
timely Sca expression, but in a domain that was too broad; a relatively
large taAto_sca resulted in Sca expression in a correctly confined do—
main, but too late. Neither agrees with the experimentally observed
timely and confined Sca distribution. To check if a large Sca/Notch
binding affinity would make Sca distribution correctly confined, dif—
ferent leN and kScaN (the parameters reflecting Notch/Delta and
Notch/Sca binding affinity) were tried. A large kScaN alone was un—
able to fully prevent Delta/Notch binding and ato repression in pro-
neural cells and, since Sca is diffusible, a very large kScaN resulted in
repression of Notch lateral inhibition in intervening cells.

Since Delta/Notch binding was not adequately blocked by Sca in
proneural cells in the model, ato down regulation by NICD (event
NICD_Rep_ato) happened simultaneously in both proneural and
intervening cells (Figs 3 and 4) (experimental observations are that
ato down regulation happens first in intervening cells). A question
is, if this probably ﬂawed Notch signaling is due to 5ch expression
being solely controlled by Ato, what could be the extra regulators of
Sca? No evidence highlighting any co—regulators within the Notch
pathway has been reported. It is reported that EGFR activation pro—
motes Delta expression (Tsuda et al., 2002), and it is speculated that
MAPK activity in proneural cells could help antagonize Notch lat—
eral inhibition (Jones and Moses, 2004). However, as our simula—
tions show, the EGFIUMAPK system acts too late to participate in
Sca regulation. Whether, apart from the Notch and EGFR path-
ways, there are components in other pathways that participate in
the timely regulation of Sca is an open question. Nevertheless, the
model indicates that even with the ﬂaw in Notch signaling, R8 pat-
terning is still very robust, resistant to many parameter changes.

4.3 Concerted EGFR and Notch signaling

Notch signaling is involved in diverse biological processes to gener—
ate NICD to activate a range of target genes. A specific and well
characterized aspect of Notch signaling is lateral inhibition, by

which a cell that obtains or is about to obtain a particular fate in—
hibits its neighboring cells from obtaining the same fate. In this situ—
ation NICD generation is maintained and amplified for a period of
time by Notch signaling via a negative feedback in which NICD, to—
gether with other factors, enhances Notch expression and represses
Delta expression to force cells to adopt different fates (Collier,
1996; Heitzler, 1991).

EGFR is reported to act antagonistically with Notch—mediated lat—
eral inhibition to promote proneural genes in proneural clusters (Culi
et al., 2001). Nevertheless, Drosophila eye provides an example
showing that, by activating the downstream Ro via an inhibitory fac-
tor (Baonza et al., 2001; Spencer et al., 1998), it also acts synergistic—
ally with Notch to repress proneural genes in intervening cells. By
examining how the model responds to changed parameters, we find
that EGFR signaling, by activating diffusible Ro, inﬂuences R8 pat—
terning more significantly than Notch signaling (the latter functions at
smaller scale) (Fig. 3). Given that Notch and EGFR can be tissue—spe—
cifically activated by multiple proneural genes, including ato, achaete
and saute, we postulate that, besides Ro (an eye—specific homeobox
gene (Saint et al., 1988)), other tissue—specific inhibitory EGFR down-
stream targets should also exist, which enable EGFR signaling to play
specific roles in different cells, antagonistically or synergistically with
Notch. Indeed, other pathways also work synergistically instead of in-
dependently for information processing during development
(Hayward et al., 2008). Moreover, simulations suggest that the pro—
posed inhibitory factor in the eye, produced dependent on EGFR sig—
naling, may have a half—life comparable to that of PtcB and a
diffusion scope comparable to that of Spitz.

This study predicts that the key events of Notch and EGFR sig—
nalling follow a specific and robust spatiotemporal order in R8 and
its neighbouring cells. This spatiotemporal order also enables EGFR
signaling and Ro expression to be correctly and stably distributed in
cells when a new round of ato expression and R8 generation is acti—
vated. Notably, compared with events in R8s, events in other cells
are not only fewer but also more varied, which is reasonable because
the fate of these cells is undetermined.

4.4 A new dimension of robustness of developmental
patterning

Glypicans are reported to play important roles in regulating the
movement of diffusible molecules and their gradients in cells by buf—
fering their concentration ﬂuctuations (Kreuger et al., 2004; Lin,
2004). Since no glypican is included in the model, when a failed or
ectopic R8 occurs, it considerably affects the concentration of Hh,
Inf and other diffusible proteins in cells and impair the following R8
patterning. Despite the absence of glypicans and the ﬂaw in Notch
signaling, the model still shows impressive robustness against
changes in parameters and in signaling events. The robustness of R8
patterning, examined for the first time upon captured signaling
events, reveals a new dimension of robustness of developmental sig—
naling and patterning. Different from such mechanisms as feedbacks
and redundant components in signaling pathways, this dimension of
robustness is determined by the occurrence and order of essential
signaling events (Zhu and Mao, 2015), whereas the occurrence, tim—
ing and order of other events can be varied without visibly influenc—
ing R8 patterning. This property may widely exist in developmental
signaling and patterning.

4.5 The logic of developmental signaling
‘Timing is everything’ in developmental signaling has been well rec—
ognized, but details of how critically timing inﬂuences signaling are

H.Zhu et al.

 

poorly uncovered. More fundamental than timing is the logic of de-
velopmental signaling, which is frequently discussed but never
clearly defined. A case in point is Notch pathway, which is remark-
ably simple but performs exceedingly complex signaling, making it
important to reveal how Notch signaling intrinsically follows spe-
cific logic (or protocols) when interacting with other pathways. Our
simulations show that for R8 patterning controlled jointly by the in-
ductive Hh signaling and restrictive Notch/EGFR signaling, the tim-
ing of some events is critical but of others is less important, upon
which key and inessential events can be determined. Moreover, se—
quences of key events and their spatiotemporal orders specify a clear
pattern of intracellular and intercellular signaling required for or-
derly transmission of information. We do not assume that every sin—
gle event is correct, but believe that as a whole such patterns,
concrete and tangible for a definition of logic and comparable to
protocols of communication (such as the TCP/IP protocol for com—
munication between computer programs), more fundamentally char-
acterize developmental signaling than gradual or abrupt changes of
molecular concentrations. We postulate that the revealed pattern
may also dominate concerted lateral inhibition during many proc-
esses of competitive cell fate determination and positively answer
the question of ‘whether pattern formation in other animals uses all
or some of the same logical steps’ (Lawrence and Struhl, 1996).

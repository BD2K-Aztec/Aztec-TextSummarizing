ABSTRACT

Summary: Parameter estimation is crucial for the modeling and
dynamic analysis of biological systems. However, implementing
parameter estimation is time consuming and computationally
demanding. Here, we introduced a parallel parameter estimation
tool for Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML)-based models
(SBML-PET—MPI). SBML-PET—MPI allows the user to perform
parameter estimation and parameter uncertainty analysis by
collectively fitting multiple experimental datasets. The tool is
developed and parallelized using the message passing interface
(MPI) protocol, which provides good scalability with the number of
processors.

Availability: SBML-PET—MPI is freely available for non-commercial
use at http://www.bioss.uni-freiburg.de/cms/sbml-pet-mpi.html or

1 INTRODUCTION

Mathematical models, paired with experimental analysis, have been
widely used for the studies on cellular signaling pathways, gene
regulatory networks and metabolic networks. In order to perform
simulation and kinetic analysis of the models, one must know the
parameter values for the modeled biological system. However, some
parameter values cannot be experimentally measured in practice
and their values are unknown. Therefore, parameter estimation is
a common issue and very important for the mathematical modeling
of biological systems.

To address the parameter estimation problem, we previously
developed a parameter estimation tool called Systems Biology
Markup Language (SBML)—PET to automatically estimate the
unknown parameters of SBML—based models (Hucka et al., 2003) by
ﬁtting a variety of experimental datasets (Zi and Klipp, 2006). The
availability of many parameter estimation tools has facilitated the
development of models in systems biology community (Hirmajer
et al., 2009; Hoops et al., 2006; Koh et al., 2010; Maiwald and
Timmer, 2008; Quach et al., 2007; Zi and Klipp, 2006). However,
implementing parameter estimation is still time consuming and
computationally demanding. A parallel implementation of a global
optimization algorithm was developed by J i and Xu (2006), but it did
not address the issue of parameter estimation for SBML models. A
fast and convenient parameter estimation tool is yet to be developed.
Here, we introduce a new parallel parameter estimation tool for

SBML—based models, which is named as SBML—PET—MPI. This
tool allows the user to perform parameter estimation and parameter
uncertainty analysis by collectively ﬁtting multiple experimental
datasets. SBML—PET—MPI is parallelized using the message passing
interface (MPI) protocol (Gropp et al., 1996). It is fast and efﬁcient as
it provides a good speed up scalability for parameter estimation and
analysis depending on the number of processors and the complexity
of the model.

2 SOFTWARE FEATURES

Using the MPI protocol, SBML—PET—MPI implemented several
algorithms for parameter estimation, and parameter uncertainty
analysis, which include:

(1) Parameter estimation with stochastic ranking evolution
strategy (SRES) global optimization algorithm (Runarsson
and Yao, 2000). SBML—PET—MPI automatically estimates the
parameter values that minimize the difference between model
and data based on weighted least squares.

(2) Parameter uncertainty analysis with proﬁle likelihood exploit
algorithm. SBML—PET—MPI parallelizes the algorithm of
proﬁle likelihood exploit for the identiﬁability analysis and
conﬁdence intervals analysis of the estimated parameters
(Raue et al., 2009). Levenberg—Marquardt algorithm
(Marquardt, 1963) is used for the optimization in proﬁle
likelihood exploit algorithm.

(3) Parameter uncertainty analysis with the bootstrap method.
SBML—PET—MPI implements another algorithm to get the
conﬁdence limits of the estimated parameters based on a
bootstrap approach, which generates new synthetic datasets
DS from the actual experimental datasets D0 (Press et al.,
1992):

Ds(i)=Do(i)+5i (1)

where 6,- is randomly taken from a normal distribution N (0,0,), 0,-
corresponds to the standard deviation in the i—th experimental data.

3 IMPLEMENTATION AND PERFORMANCE

SBML—PET—MPI was parallelized with the MPI protocol. To speed
up the solving of the ordinary differential system, SBML—PET—MPI
integrated ODEPACK library (Hindmarsh, 1983) and is coded in C
programming language. It supports the models in SBML format by
using libSBML package (Bornstein et al., 2008).

Fig. 1. The running time and speed up for the global optimization and
parameter identiﬁability analysis of the example models using 1—20 CPUs
(options: —with—gen= 1000 —with—p1e). The running time might slightly
vary at different execution of the program due to the variation of model
simulations with different parameter sets.

To evaluate the performance of the parallelized parameter
estimation analysis algorithms, we recorded the running time of
SBML—PET—MPI for global optimization (parameter estimation) and
proﬁle likelihood exploit analysis (parameter uncertainty analysis)
for the Epo model with multiple real experimental datasets (Becker
et al., 2010) and the Escherichia coli tryptophan operon model
with datasets from different conditions. Details about the examples
are described in SBML—PET—MPI user—guide document. The speed
up (calculated as ratio of the running time with one processor to
that with n multiple processors, T1 /Tn) is good with the increased
number of processors in these examples (Fig. 1).

In practice, the speed up performance depends on the balance of
the decreased time by task parallelization and the increased time for
data exchange in different processors. One can assume that the total
time for parameter estimation and uncertainty analysis is x seconds
with one CPU, among which y seconds are required for the tasks
that cannot be parallelized. In this tool, the ﬁrst processor is used for
algorithm coordination and data exchange. The rest tasks with x —y
seconds computation time are distributed into other n — 1 processors.
On the other hand, the addition of new processors requires more
communication computation time, if one assume that it is linearly
increased, there will be z X (n — 1) more time. In this case, the speed
up can be calculated with Equation (2). The speed up scalability is in
general better for complex models with more estimated parameters
and more experimental datasets.

4 OUTLOOK

With the popularity of multi—core processors and clusters, there is
an increasing demand for the parallelization of parameter estimation

and simulation tools for the modeling and analysis of biological
systems. A parallelized parameter estimation tool (e. g. SBML—PET—
MPI) will decrease the time of parameter estimation for the model
development and let the modelers focus on the model analysis
and the investigated biological questions. The systems biology
community will beneﬁt from more parallelized tools for model
simulation and analysis.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: An increasing amount of evidence from experimental
and computational analysis suggests that rare codon clusters are
functionally important for protein activity. Most of the studies on
rare codon clusters were performed on a limited number of proteins
or protein families. In the present study, we present the Sherlocc
program and how it can be used for large scale protein family analysis
of evolutionarily conserved rare codon clusters and their relation
to protein function and structure. This large-scale analysis was
performed using the whole Pfam database covering over 70% of the
known protein sequence universe. Our program Sherlocc, detects
statistically relevant conserved rare codon clusters and produces a
user-friendly HTML output.

Results: Statistically significant rare codon clusters were detected in
a multitude of Pfam protein families. The most statistically significant
rare codon clusters were predominantly identified in N-terminal Pfam
families. Many of the longest rare codon clusters are found in
membrane-related proteins which are required to interact with other
proteins as part of their function, for example in targeting or insertion.
We identified some cases where rare codon clusters can play a
regulating role in the folding of catalytically important domains. Our
results support the existence of a widespread functional role for rare
codon clusters across species. Finally, we developed an online filter-
based search interface that provides access to Sherlocc results for
all Pfam families.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent studies suggest that beyond the amino acid sequence lies an
additional layer of information, hidden within the codon sequence,
able to mediate local kinetics of translation. In fact, synonymous
codons that are used with low frequency, tend to have a depleted
concentration of tRNAs (Duret, 2000; Ikemura, 1985; Moriyama
and Powell, 1997; Percudani et al., 1997) thus causing ribosomes
to pause at rare codons until the scarce activated tRNA brings the
next amino acid to the growing polypeptide (Sprensen et al., 1989;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Varenne et al., 1984). The observation that rare codons are not
randomly distributed but rather organized in large clusters (Clarke
and Clark, 2008) across species support the existence of a selective
evolutionary pressure.

Many roles have been proposed to explain the heterogeneity
of translational kinetics. For example, protein folding is a co—
translational process during which the nascent polypeptide chain is
in dynamic interaction with components of the cellular milieu such
as the ribosome structure, chaperone proteins, solvent molecules and
also with its own residues. The speed at which the polypeptide chain
grows dictates the time scale within which the translated residues
that have already exited the ribosomal channel undergo local folding
events (at—helices are somehow an exception as they tend to start
forming inside the tunnel). In this context, while not altering the
sequence of the nascent protein, synonymous codon changes can
lead to distinct folding pathways (Tsai et al., 2008).

Several studies focused on identifying rare codons in protein
sequences and replacing them with frequent synonymous ones. The
results were diverse: decrease of a protein’s speciﬁc activity (Komar
et al., 1999), a change in substrate speciﬁcity (Kimchi—Sarfaty et al.,
2007) and a decrease in protein solubility and activation of a gene
designed to detect misfolded proteins (Cortazzo et al., 2002). For
these three studies, the results were suggested to be due to alterations
in the folding pathway of the protein. It was also observed that
slowly translated regions tend to preferentially code for ,B—strands
and coils, whereas faster translated regions tend to code for a—helices
(Thanaraj and Argos, 1996a). Recent work showed that translation
speed decreases at the start of secondary structures in Escherichia
coli (Saunders and Deane, 2010).

The ribosomal pauses caused by rare codons can in principle
regulate—speciﬁc folding events but could also be involved in other
mechanisms involving the nascent polypeptide chain such as protein
targeting or co—translational molecular recognition events. A study
that examined genes of Emericella nidalans observed a correlation
between the position of hydrophobic stretches, predicted to span
across a membrane or to be a cleavable signal sequence, and rare
codon clusters suggesting a potential control over membrane protein
targeting or membrane insertion (Dessen and Kepes, 2000). It was
observed that signal sequences of exported proteins of E. coli and
Salmonella typhimariam were enriched with rare codons (Burns
and Beacham, 1985; Power at al., 2004). One study suggested that
rare codons favored the proper structural arrangement of an a—helix
signal sequence, which ensured that the protein correctly followed
its secretion pathway (Zalucki and Jennings, 2007). Moreover, a
correlation between the position of rare codon clusters in mRNA

and protein domain boundaries was observed (Komar and J aenicke,
1995; Krasheninnikov et al., 1991; Purvis et al., 1987; Thanaraj and
Argos, 1996b). All these results highlight the potential importance
of rare codon clusters regarding various events of the early protein,
may it be folding, membrane insertion or export/targeting. Also
at a functional level, a bias in codon usage may be important
to indirectly regulate the function of cell cycle—regulated genes
(Frenkel—Morgenstern et al., 2012). Some algorithms have been
implemented to detect rare codon clusters (Clarke and Clark, 2008;
Makhoul and Trifonov, 2002; Widmann et al., 2008) and all were
tested against a limited number of protein sequences or protein
families.

In this study, we present a simple and efﬁcient algorithm,
Sherlocc, for the detection of statistically signiﬁcant rare codon
clusters within protein families and evolutionarily conserved across
species. We performed a large—scale study of the distribution of
conserved rare codon clusters across all protein families present in
Pfam (over 11000 families). We use the results of the large—scale
analysis and integrate various sources of information to corroborate
the different roles of rare codon clusters proposed in the literature.
The program generates an HTML output that allows a user to
visualize the position of the family—conserved rare codon clusters
inside the Pfam protein family in which the organism—speciﬁc codon
usage information has been integrated. The program as well as the
ﬁlter—based search interface is available at bcb.med.usherbrooke.ca.

2 METHODS

2.1 Detection of rare codon clusters

Sherlocc, for SHERbrOOke Locator 0f C0d0n Clusters, is written in PERL.
The protein family alignments on which the analysis was performed are
from the Pfam—A Seed release 24.0 that contained 11 912 protein families
(Finn et al., 2010) and are the primary input of the program. The Sherlocc
algorithm passes through three stages, summarized in Supplementary Figure
S1 and explained below.

Stage 1. Sherlocc retrieves the nucleotide sequence of every protein in
each Pfam protein family alignments from the European nucleotide archive
(ENA) database (Leinonen et al., 2011) using cross—referencing from the
Uniprot website (Magrane and Consortium, 2011). Using the appropriate
translation table (also retrieved from the ENA database), the correspondence
of the nucleotide sequence with the amino acid sequence provided in the
Pfam alignment is veriﬁed.

Stage 2. Using the taxonomic identiﬁer retrieved during Stage 1, the
specie—speciﬁc codon usage frequencies are retrieved using the Kazusa codon
usage frequency online database (Nakamura et al., 2000). The codon usage
frequencies in this online database have been calculated using nucleotide
sequences of individual organisms from the NCBI GenBank sequences
(Benson et al., 2011). In our study, the proteins for which no codon usage
frequency values could be assigned were discarded from the protein family
alignments. We provide directly on our website the Stage 2 output ﬁles
for each protein family so that a user can skip Stages 1 and 2 which are
time—consuming due to multiple online queries.

Stage 3. To detect rare codon clusters, a seven codon—wide window (blue
canvas in Fig. 1), centered at every position of the alignment, averages all
codon usage frequencies inside the seven codon—wide window. This average
calculated across all proteins of the alignment has subsequently the net
effect of assuring that only positions that are rare across the majority of the
members of the family are retained. The averages calculated by this window
at all positions of all Pfam protein alignments were ﬁtted into an extreme
value distribution as described in Laskowski et al., (2005) and references
therein. From this distribution (Fig. 2), a statistically signiﬁcant threshold

At the bottom (gray row), codon usage frequency averages calculated at each
position by the ﬁrst window (blue canvas) is displayed in bold (11.56 for
position 168). Averages under the selected threshold are considered ‘slow’

can be chosen. This threshold will allow us to discriminate positions of the
alignment occupied by rare codons with a statistically signiﬁcant low codon
usage frequency average. In the example of Figure 1, this threshold is 13,
and all codon usage frequency averages under this threshold are tagged as
slow (orange; positions 166—169). To retain only the regions with a high
density of slow positions (a rare codon cluster), a second seven position—
wide window (purple canvas in Fig. 1) parses the alignments searching for
windows with at least four pause positions out of seven. This method retains
only the regions occupied by amino acids encoded by the ‘slowest’ codons
among all existing positions in all protein families. This implies that even
if mutations have led to a different codon and in some cases to a different
amino acid, the low codon usage frequency was conserved.

2.2 Analysis of preferential positioning of rare
codon clusters

A Pfam protein family represents a single domain, which can be part of a
single or multi—domain protein. To investigate a preferential positioning of
rare codon clusters in the protein as a whole, one must determine where the
Pfam domain is positioned relative to the other domains of the protein (for
a multi—domain protein). Each Pfam family of the dataset was classiﬁed as
either strictly N—terminal (with respect to the entire protein) or not strictly
N—tenninal. To make such classiﬁcation, the complete protein sequences
(long sequences) of each member—protein in all Pfam families were retrieved
from the Uniprot website (Magrane and Consortium, 2011). Every protein
sequence of the Pfam family alignments (the short sequence) was aligned to
its corresponding long sequence using Fasta (Pearson and Lipman, 1988).
The number of residues in the long sequence before the start of the short
sequence was calculated. The Pfam family was characterized as a strictly
N—terminal domain only if the number of residues before the start of the short
sequence was <50 residues for every member—protein; else it was classiﬁed
as a not strictly N—terminal Pfam family. For simplicity of language, all not
strictly N—terminal Pfam families are referred to as C—terminal Pfam families.

2.3 Comparison of translational pauses on structures
of the same fold

To investigate if rare codon clusters regulate protein folding in a similar way
for protein families of the same structural architecture, families containing
rare codon clusters were grouped by structural topology. To do so, a
representative PDB chain ID was assigned to each Pfam protein family
using EBI SIFTS initiative cross—referencing (Velankar et al., 2005) and

the PDB chains were assigned to a structural topology using the CATH
database (Orengo et al., 1997). To ﬁnd the position of rare codon clusters on
the 3D structures, each member—protein sequence of the family was aligned
with the PDB residue sequence using Fasta (Pearson and Lipman, 1988).
The sequence with the highest similarity with the PDB residue sequence
was used to infer rare codon cluster positions on the PDB structure. We
compared among the similar folds, the region of the nascent chain predicted
to extrude the ribosome tunnel at the start of the pause (when the ribosome
is positioned at the start of a rare codon cluster). The ribosome tunnel can
hold in average 30 residues of the nascent chain and sometimes more if the
chain is arranged in the form of an a—helix (Etchells and Hartl, 2004). We
marked the 10 residues positioned 30—40 residues away from the rare codon
clusters toward the N—termini. This 10 residues interval accounts for the
possibility that the polypeptide chain within the tunnel can be 30—40 residues
long. Protein structures of the same structural topology were compared using
PyMOL (Schrbdinger, LLC).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

A total of 11 564 protein family alignments from the initial 11 912
were analyzed by Sherlocc. The 348 discarded families had for all
members either no corresponding nucleotide sequence or codon
usage frequency information. The whole dataset was analyzed
for rare codon clusters using 6 different codon usage frequency
thresholds (13—18). Smaller thresholds identify rare codon clusters
occupied by codons with a lower codon usage frequency. The protein
sequences from the families analyzed encompass 6439 different
species, eukaryotes and prokaryotes. The 11564 alignment ﬁles
with mapped rare codon clusters (if any) for every threshold can
be visualized on our website via a ﬁlter—based searchable interface.

Supplementary Table S1 summarizes statistics calculated from
families with clusters identiﬁed at thresholds 13—18. Lower
thresholds decrease the number of Pfam families with rare codon
clusters, going from 3360 to 154 for thresholds 18—13, respectively.
Rare codon clusters are conserved in proteins families containing
up to 606 and 36 protein sequences for thresholds 18 and 13,
respectively. The average number of protein sequences in a Pfam
family with rare codon clusters (9.8 and 2.6 for thresholds 18 and
13) is relatively low, revealing that the consensus low codon usage
frequency region is generally shared among a limited number of
protein sequences. Interestingly, there are some cases where the rare
codon clusters are conserved in Pfam families containing up to 147
different species, prokaryotes and eukaryotes. The highest number
of unique species per Pfam family with at least 1 cluster ranges from
147 to 20 (for thresholds 18—13). The size of the largest cluster is
114 and 23 (for thresholds 18—13). The Pfam families were sorted in
descending order of each of the last three columns of Supplementary
Table S1.

The purpose of the study is to identify evolutionarily conserved
rare codon clusters. Pfam families consist of high—quality alignments
of protein sequences constructed using Hidden Markov Model
proﬁles which make an ideal dataset for this type of analysis.
Although, it is important to note that protein sequences in the Pfam
family alignments represent only a fraction of their open reading
frames (ORFs). Supplementary Figure S2 shows distributions of
the ratio of ORFs not represented by any Pfam family for each
individual protein (284 929 proteins) in all analyzed families. The
distribution reveals that for proteins longer or equal to 400 residues
(Supplementary Figure S2C), a large proportion of the ORF was
not analyzed. This implies that some observations still debated in

the literature cannot be conﬁrmed with the present study i.e. the
propensity for rare codon clusters to be near domain boundaries
observed by Thanaraj and Argos (1996b), Komar and J aenicke
(1995) and Komar (2009) but not observed by Saunders and Deane
(2010). As seen in Supplementary Figure S2B, 50% of proteins <400
residues (63.4% of the dataset) have a small fraction (~24%) of ORF
excluded from the analysis (not represented in any Pfam family).

3.1 Identifying statistically signiﬁcant rare codon
clusters in protein families

Plotting the distribution of all the codon usage frequency averages
(blue canvas in Fig. 1), we can ﬁnd a statistically signiﬁcant
threshold able to identify, among all amino acid positions of the
11564 families, the ones occupied by the least used codons. We
plotted such distribution (Fig. 2) of the calculated codon usage
frequency averages (>1 700 000 values; mean: 23.754; and SD:
4.868).

This statistical approach helps us to deal with the fact that codon
usage frequencies form a continuum and that no a priori threshold
value exists that can discriminate a rare codon from a frequent one
based on the codon usage value alone. Once the codon positions are
tagged as ‘slow’ or ‘fast’ based on the threshold, the program can
search for regions with a high density of these ‘slow’ positions (rare
codon clusters) using the second mobile window (purple canvas in
Fig. 1). For some families, the low codon usage frequency of a given
position might not be conserved among all member—proteins of the
family. The proteins for which this is the case can be identiﬁed using
the HTML output.

3.2 Validation of identiﬁed clusters

We compared clusters identiﬁed by Sherlocc with cases found
in the literature. For example, the impact of rare codons in
the chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT) protein has been
previously studied experimentally in E. coli (Komar et al., 1999).
The study showed that silent mutations of rare to frequent codons
in the CAT protein accelerated the rate of synthesis and led to a
20% decrease in speciﬁc activity, which was suggested to be due
to protein misfolding. Rare codon clusters have been identiﬁed
computationally in a multi—organism sequence alignment of this
protein (Widmann et al., 2008). Our algorithm, using a threshold

of 18, also identiﬁed a rare codon cluster in the CAT protein
family (PF00302). Another case involves the Salmonella phage P22
tailspike protein in which rare codons were previously identiﬁed
using the MinMax algorithm (Clarke and Clark, 2008). Sherlocc
identiﬁed rare codon clusters in the Salmonella phage P22 tailspike
protein family (PF09251) down to a threshold of 15 (P—value:
1.72 x 10—8).

3.3 Filtering for the longest clusters

To investigate potential roles of rare codon clusters, the 673 Pfam
families with rare codon clusters identiﬁed with a threshold of
15 (chosen to investigate the most statistically rare clusters while
retaining sufﬁcient data) were ﬁltered to keep only families with
at least 5 protein sequences and containing at least 1 long rare
codon cluster of 12 residues in length or more. The protein families
resulting from this ﬁltering process are shown in Table 1. From the
673, 143 have at least 5 member—proteins and 72 have at least 1
rare codon cluster that spans a minimum of 12 residues. Combining
the 2 ﬁlters leaves 13 Pfam families. From the 13 families,
4 have unknown localization (PF07227, PF05340, PF05831 and
PF05265). From the remaining 9 families, 7 of them represent
proteins that are inserted into membranes, mostly mitochondrial or
thylakoidal membranes (PF05115, PF00283, PF06444, PF00510,
PF02326, PF01059 and PF06525). Another (PF04764) has an
imprecise localization although it is known to be in chloroplast. The
remaining family (PF05394) represents several avirulence proteins
from Pseudomonas syringae and Xanthomonas campestris. For the
9 families with known localization, 7 (possibly 8, PF04764) of them
are membrane proteins.

A plausible explanation for ﬁnding long statistically signiﬁcant
rare codon clusters mostly in membrane proteins is the co—
translational membrane insertion mechanism. Earlier studies on
genes of Saccharomyces cerevisia, E. coli and E. nidalans reported
that rare codon clusters could be involved in protein membrane
insertion (Dessen and Kepes, 2000; Kepes, 1996). Other studies on
E. coli emphasize the potential involvement of rare codon codons
for protein export/secretion (Burns and Beacham, 1985; Power
et al., 2004; Zalucki and Jennings, 2007; Zalucki et al., 2011).
Despite the suggestions made in these studies, the role of rare
codon clusters and their molecular mechanism involved in secretion
or membrane translocation/insertion remain unclear. Although the
current study does not ﬁll a gap in this regard, our results from
a large—scale analysis (11564 protein families) that indicate a
preferential N—terminal positioning of rare codon clusters (discussed
further) and a high incidence of large evolutionarily conserved rare
codon clusters in membrane related proteins further strengthens the
evidence that rare codon clusters are involved in co—translational
molecular recognition events involved either in targeting proteins
for secretion or insertion into membranes. In many cases, molecular
recognition events happen co—translationally. For example, the
recognition of the SRP signal sequence in the nascent chain by the
SRP protein happens co—translationally (Saraogi and Shan, 2011).
The ribosome—nascent—chain—SRP complex trafﬁcs to a membrane—
bound SRP receptor where the protein is translocated/inserted
in the membrane (for review see Jha and Komar, 2011; Wang
and Dalbey, 2011). All these mechanisms are dependent on
molecular recognition of signal peptides (often positioned in the
N—terminal) by a chaperone protein that will guide the protein to its

precise localization. The recognition of the signal peptide is an early
critical step during which the signal peptide sequence needs to be
optimally exposed to the cellular milieu for recognition. While our
evidence for co—translational molecular recognition is based on the
restricted number of results obtained using parameters that select
only the largest, most statistically—relevant evolutionarily conserved
rare codon clusters, we believe that many more such cases exist,
with perhaps smaller clusters or involving less rare codons.

We investigated in more detail the potential co—translational rare—
codon regulated membrane insertion using the Pfam family PF00283
(Table 1). This family represents the transmembrane segment of
Cytochrome b559, which forms part of the reaction center of the

multi—subunit protein—pigment complex PSII and that has been
shown to be essential to the PSII assembly. The PSII complex
is mainly constituted of D1 and D2 proteins, a and ,8 subunits
of Cytochrome b559, psbI and pis gene products. One of the
ﬁrst steps of the PSII assembly is believed to be the formation
of a D2—Cytochrome b559 complex (Muller and Eichacker, 1999).
Translational slow down during synthesis of Cytochrome b559 could
help its binding to the D2 protein already inserted in the membrane.
Cytochrome b559 is composed of 3 segments: a stromal segment
attached to a transmembrane segment of ~21 amino acids mainly
encoded by rare codons and a ﬁnal C—terminal lumenal segment. The
translational pause caused by the rare codons of the transmembrane
segment can give additional time for a signal sequence in the
N—terminal stromal segment to co—translationally recognize the
D2 protein (Fig. 3) either via a direct protein—protein interaction
or a chaperone—based mechanism (like the previously mentioned
example of the SRP protein). This would require the signal sequence
to be extruded form the ribosome that is positioned at a rare
codon cluster 30—40 residues downstream. This result complements
the already known similar mechanism that has been observed
for the next step of the assembly, which involves association of
D1 to the D2—Cytochrome b559 complex. Experimental evidence
indicates that the association of D1 to the D2—Cytochrome b559
complex happens co—translationally and via a direct interaction
of the nascent D1 chain with the D2 protein (Kim et al., 1991;
Zhang et al., 1999). mRNA secondary structures was suggested to
cause a translational slowdown during D1 synthesis (Zama, 1995).
In summary, we observe rare codon clusters in the ﬁrst step of
the insertion mechanism in addition to the already known second
step (D1 insertion). Sherlocc, along with the ﬁlter—based searchable
interface, can be a useful tool to study these mechanisms in more
detail by providing location of putative translational pause sites.

3.4 Position of rare codon clusters relative to the
N-terminal end of domains

We measured the distances in number of residues between the
rare codon clusters and the N—terminal end of the Pfam domains
(Fig. 4A). The majority of rare codon clusters are within the ﬁrst
130 residues of the Pfam protein domains. There is a steep increase
of rare codon clusters as we get close to the N—terminal. Figure 4B
shows the distances normalized by the length of the respective Pfam
domain. The Pfam lengths distribution is available in Supplementary
Material (Supplementary Figure S3). From Figure 4B we see that
the clusters have only a weak preference for N—terminal positions.
When interpreting this result, it is important to keep in mind that
Pfam protein families represent protein domains that can come from
multi— or single—domain proteins. For this reason we categorized
the protein families containing rare codon clusters as either strictly
representing the ﬁrst N—terminal domain (N—terminal Pfam family)
or as representing the second, third or further non—N—terminal
domain (what we refer for simplicity as a C—terminal Pfam family).

Figure 5 shows the fraction of the number of N—terminal families
with clusters over the number of C—terminal families with clusters
for 6 different codon usage frequency average thresholds (13—18).
As we lower the threshold (lower frequency, increase rareness), we
signiﬁcantly raise the proportion of N—terminal Pfam families with
clusters. When analyzing the dataset with a threshold of 13, there is
a 3—fold increase of strictly N—terminal Pfam families with clusters.

Lower thresholds identify rare codon clusters with the lowest codon usage in
the whole dataset. As we reduce the threshold we notice clusters are mainly
found in Pfam families that represent strictly N—terminal domains.

This value decreases as we raise the threshold ending at a ratio of
1:1 for threshold 18 (N—terminal/C—terminal). This result reveals that
rare codon clusters identiﬁed with more stringent thresholds tend to
be positioned closer to the N—terminal of the full protein sequences
(i.e. the N—terminal of domains in single domain proteins or the ﬁrst
domain). Rare codon clusters with a higher codon usage have a more
diffused positional preference.

found an increased incidence of rare codon clusters at the N—terminal

Conserved rare codon clusters

 

in 15 prokayotes and a smaller but signiﬁcant increase of rare codons
in the C—terminal for 11 of the prokaryotes studied. Our results,
based on >6000 different species (eukaryotes and prokaryotes),
do not clearly show an increase in the C—terminal end. As noted
by Clarke and Clark (2010), the mechanism of translation is very
different in eukaryotes versus prokaryotes which can explain the
absence of signal in the C—terminal in eukaryotic proteins. The
protein families analyzed here can be composed of proteins from
prokaryotes and eukaryotes. In such cases, the contribution of the
signals of rare codon clusters in the C—terminal in prokaryotic
proteins can be dampened by the lack of signal in the eukaryotic
sequences explaining why a clear peak is not observed in the
C—terminal in the present study.

The results point toward a differential usage of rare codon clusters
based on the codon usage frequency. Clusters identiﬁed with lower
thresholds (i.e. 13) theoretically cause longer ribosomal pausing.
These clusters seem to be positioned closer to the N—termini where
they can coordinate the insertion of membrane protein. Others have
suggested that an N—terminal enrichment in rare codons could help to
avoid ribosome collisions downstream (Lesnik et al., 2000). Clusters
identiﬁed with higher thresholds i.e. 18 (causing shorter ribosomal
pauses) are more dispersed along the Pfam domain. They could
help ﬁne—tune the multiple steps of the protein folding process. For
instance, (Saunders and Deane, 2010) observed that rare codons are
positioned preferably at the transition between secondary structures.
We further discuss the involvement of rare codon clusters for protein
structure below.

3.5 Implication of rare codon clusters in protein
structure

Some studies focused on the role of rare codon clusters for
protein structure and indirectly folding (Saunders and Deane, 2010;
Thanaraj and Argos, 1996a; Widmann et al., 2008). However, the
issue of how rare codons inﬂuence folding is still unclear (Deane
and Saunders, 2011). We wished to revisit this potential role by
comparing protein families of the same fold that have rare codon
clusters. However, unlike previous studies, we extended our analysis
to the entire Pfam database. Using a rather conservative threshold
codon usage frequency average of 18 (P—value of 3.00X10_4),
a total of 3360 Pfam families had rare codons clusters identiﬁed
in them. We used a threshold of 18 here as opposed to 15 in all
other analysis in this study because we wished to identify clusters
with signiﬁcantly low codon usage frequency averages but that gave
us enough groups of protein families of the same structural fold to
perform our comparative analysis. Grouping these protein families
with rare codon clusters by structural topology led to 81 groups.
For clarity of presentation we do not present this list here but it is
accessible at our website.

We ﬁrst investigate if the rare codon clusters partitions the
nascent chain in corresponding structurally equivalent sections in
different proteins of the same fold. Furthermore, we mapped on
representative 3D structures of each family the position of the
portion of the nascent chain that just extruded the ribosome tunnel
at the moment the predicted pause occurred. This method allows
us to visualize what nascent chain section of the corresponding
structures would lie outside the ribosome tunnel at the time of
the translational pauses. We found some similarities within the
81 structural groups. However, our results in this regard are not

sufﬁciently clear or widespread to suggest a predominant role for
rare codon clusters in inducing pauses that may be necessary for co—
translational folding events necessary for correct folding in different
proteins of the same structural fold. The few noteworthy exceptions
are described further down in what follows. The actual rare codon
clusters (for all thresholds) were mapped on PDB structures that
have 100% identity with a member—protein sequence for visual
inspection (Supplementary Material). The uncertainty regarding the
length of the polypeptide chain held in the ribosome tunnel may
affect our analysis. Experimental data conﬁrms that a—helices can
form in the ribosome tunnel (Bhushan et al., 2010), notably raising
the number of residues inside the tunnel compared to a situation
where the nascent chain would be unstructured. We already know if
the residues in the tunnel form an a—helix in the ﬁnal structure, it is
uncertain if the helix is completely formed when inside the ribosome
tunnel. We use a buffer window of 10 residues to account for this
source uncertainty in our analysis.

Within the groups of structurally homologous proteins analyzed,
most of the mapped regions were in different positions relative to the
structural elements of the fold. Widmann et al., 2008 analyzed 16
different protein families of the 01/,8 hydrolase fold and concluded
the same regarding the position of rare codon clusters. What we
observed from this large—scale analysis suggests that rare codons
clusters that are conserved within a given Pfam family are not
conserved across Pfam families of the same fold. From the 81
structural topology groups the 3 top groups that had the most
protein family representatives with rare codon clusters are the
Immunoglobulin—like fold, the Rossmann fold and the Jelly r011 fold
with 39, 29 and 27 representative protein families, respectively. Over
the 81 topology groups, these 3 groups alone contained 23% of all
protein families. These three topologies are constituted mainly of
,8—strands that are organized in large sandwich like architectures,
,B—barrels or parallel ,B—strands linked to a—helices. It was observed
that ,B—strands are more stable when formed slowly and a previous
study showed that rare codons preferentially code for ,B—strands
(Thanaraj and Argos, 1996a).

Rare codon clusters can also ensure the proper formation
of a—helices as well. Experimental evidence suggested that
translational slowdown caused by rare codons were required for
an N—terminal a—helical signal peptide to fold efﬁciently (Zalucki
and Jennings, 2007). Recent studies show that interactions between
certain amino acids of the nascent chain with the surface of the
ribosome channel are possible (Lu and Deutsch, 2008; Seidelt
et al., 2009). Interactions of the nascent chain in concert with
precise translational slowdowns could guide the folding of the
nascent chain helping it acquire its helical structure inside the
ribosome tunnel. Doing so, once outside the tunnel, the helices
can efﬁciently rearrange in more complex structures e.g. coiled—
coils, helix—hairpins or helix—helix interfaces. These structures being
formed rapidly, any non—favorable interactions of hydrophobic
residues within the a—helices with the solvent could be reduced
stabilizing the overall structure. This mechanism could occur for
Chondroitin ABC lyase I. The protein is built from three structural
domains: an N—terminal domain that binds a sodium or calcium ion
(represented by PF09092), a central catalytic domain (PF09093)
and a C—terminal domain (PF02278) (Huang et al., 2003). Sherlocc
identiﬁed 11 rare codon clusters in the catalytic domain (PF09093)
and 2 in the N—terminal ion—binding domain (PF09092). The majority
of the rare codon clusters code for residues of the catalytic domain

(Supplementary Fig. S4). This domain is formed by 10 a—helices in
the shape of 5 hairpin—like pairs (Huang et al., 2003). One possible
role for the detected rare codon clusters is to produce multiple
translational pauses during the synthesis of its catalytic domain
allowing a step—wise packing of a—helix pairs.

3.6 Codon usage frequency as a measure of
translation speed

Secondary structures in the mRNA (Shpaer, 1985) as well as
electrostatic interactions of the nascent chain with ribosome
components (Lu and Deutsch, 2008; Seidelt et al., 2009) are other
factors known to cause translational slowdowns. Predicting mRNA
secondary structures in a large—scale context can be a very daunting
task and some studies showed that translational pauses observed
were not caused by mRNA secondary structures but rather by
rare codons (Surensen et al., 1989; Varenne et al., 1984). As for
electrostatic interactions, they remain poorly documented and are
therefore hard to analyze in a large—scale context.

Codon usage frequencies have been shown to correlate with
tRNA concentrations for prokaryotes as well as eukaryotes (Duret,
2000; Ikemura, 1985; Moriyama and Powell, 1997; Percudani et al.,
1997). However, there are exceptions (Parmley and Huynen, 2009;
Saunders and Deane, 2010) as tRNA concentrations are tissue—
speciﬁc and can vary depending on cell condition/cycle or growth
rate (Dong et al., 1996; Kanduc, 1997). Considering that species—
speciﬁc tRNA concentrations have been tabulated for a limited
number of species, codon usage frequencies [tabulated for 8792
different species (Nakamura et al., 2000] is the only measure that
can be used as a surrogate for translation speed in a large—scale
context. Based on these frequencies, one can measure the codon
adaptation index (CAI; Sharp and Li, 1987) or the adapted version
of by Carbone et al. (2003) which could boost the codon usage bias
signal. Although as noted by Clarke and Clark (2010), the CAI is
useful to predict highly expressed genes, but not suited to study
local translation rates. The smoothing technique combined to the
exhaustive probabilistic approach presented in this study, allows the
use of a single threshold able to increase the statistical signiﬁcance
of the low codon usage frequency signal we observe.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The primary objective of this study is to perform a large scale
survey of the occurrence of evolutionarily conserved rare codon
clusters in the almost entirety of Pfam protein families and present
Sherlocc, a program able to identify the regions of protein families
that are occupied by the lowest codon usage frequencies. As we
are interested in the large—scale analysis of evolutionarily conserved
rare codons we made use of the curated seed sequence alignments
of Pfam domains.

We identiﬁed cases where rare codon clusters are conserved in
a large number of organisms. We observed that more stringent
thresholds identify rare codon clusters mainly in protein N—terminal
Pfam domains suggesting that domains closer to the N—termini
of proteins require longer pauses. We cannot say strictly if such
pauses are required for folding or molecular recognition but based
on the involvement of families with rarer clusters with membrane
insertion or the recognition of large complexes, we suggest that rare
codon cluster are important in co—translational molecular recognition

events. We also identiﬁed speciﬁc cases where the ribosomal
pausing caused by rare codon clusters could regulate the folding
of functionally important domains.

Proteins are synthesized in a non—linear kinetic landscape and
their mRNA sequence seems to convey more information than that
which is necessary to encode protein sequences, information that
can be used not only to regulate folding events but perhaps
more importantly, to regulate co—translational molecular recognition
events such as the recognition of signal peptides, the formation of
complexes or membrane insertion. The Sherlocc program and the
online Sherlocc Finder Interface are efﬁcient tools that can be used
to study the widespread translational pauses in protein families.

Abstract

Motivation: Advances in chromosome conformation capture and next—generation sequencing
technologies are enabling genome—wide investigation of dynamic chromatin interactions. For
example, Hi—C experiments generate genome—wide contact frequencies between pairs of loci
by sequencing DNA segments ligated from loci in close spatial proximity. One essential task in
such studies is peak calling, that is, detecting non—random interactions between loci from the two—
dimensional contact frequency matrix. Successful fulfillment of this task has many important impli—
cations including identifying long—range interactions that assist interpreting a sizable fraction of the
results from genome—wide association studies. The task — distinguishing biologically meaningful
chromatin interactions from massive numbers of random interactions — poses great challenges
both statistically and computationally. Model—based methods to address this challenge are still
lacking. In particular, no statistical model exists that takes the underlying dependency structure
into consideration.

Results: In this paper, we propose a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) based Bayesian method
to rigorously model interaction probabilities in the two—dimensional space based on the contact fre—
quency matrix. By borrowing information from neighboring loci pairs, our method demonstrates
superior reproducibility and statistical power in both simulation studies and real data analysis.

A hidden Markov random field-based Hi-C peak caller

1 Introduction

Chromosomal DNA must be tightly packed to fit within the limited
space of the nucleus. The intricate, highly compacted folding of the
chromosomes, however, is by no means random. Chromatin archi-
tectures are closely linked to genomic functions by inﬂuencing how
genetic information is accessed, read, and interpreted in a given cell
and under certain local micro—environmental conditions via dynamic
interactions among genes and their regulatory elements. For ex—
ample, a long—range loop structure can be formed to link a distant
enhancer with its target gene to regulate gene transcription. Hence,
characterization of the three dimensional (3D) genome organiza-
tions is critical to understanding genomic function (Dekker et al.,
2013; Sajan and Hawkins, 2012).

Recent advancements in chromosome conformation capture
(3C) (Dekker et al., 2002) and derived methods (such as 3C, 4C, 5C
and Hi—C) allow the study of 3D chromosome organization with
increasing resolution and throughput. These 3C—based methods
quantify the interaction or contact frequency, how often any pair of
loci in the genome is in close spatial proximity. For 3C, a locus is the
unit of analysis and corresponds to one restriction enzyme fragment
(hereafter termed fragment). Approaches to analyze interaction fre—
quencies fall largely into two complementary categories: 3D model
reconstruction and peak calling. The first set of methods simultan—
eously model contact frequencies of all pairs of loci in the genome to
reconstruct 3D structure (Bau et al., 2011; Hu et al., 2013;
Jhunjhunwala et al., 2008; Marti—Renom and Mirny, 2011; Russel
et al., 2012; Trieu and Cheng, 2014). The second set of methods
aim to identify interaction peaks, meaning pairs of loci where the
observed contact frequency is higher than expected from non-ran-
dom chromatin looping or co—location events (Ay et al., 2014; Duan
et al., 2010; Sanyal et al., 2012). To answer many important biolo-
gical questions (e.g. pinpointing individual cis—regulatory elements),
higher resolution for the contributing loci is highly desirable, if not
indispensable.

This paper focuses on peak calling. Identifying non-random con-
tacts is of fundamental biological interest to researchers due to their
relevance for functional regulation. For instance, it can shed light on
the functional mechanisms of non—coding complex trait associations
identified in genome—wide association studies (GWAS). GWAS have
been resoundingly successful, identifying thousands of variants asso—
ciated with complex traits. Only a small proportion (7—12%) fall in
protein coding regions (Hindorff et al., 2009; Kumar et al., 2012;
Pennisi, 2011; Ward and Kellis, 2012) making interpretation of
non—coding variants imperative. Although a large number of regula—
tory elements have been annotated (Bernstein et al., 2012; Maurano
et al., 2012), their target genes are largely unknown (Jin et al., 2013;
Niu et al., 2014). Recent 3C—based studies are generating an increas—
ingly comprehensive catalog of interactions between genes and their
regulatory elements in different cell types at varying resolution
across multiple organisms including drosophila, yeast, mouse and
human (Hou et al., 2012; Lieberman—Aiden et al., 2009; Sexton
et al., 2012; Smallwood and Ren, 2013). Such information will be
fundamental to understanding functional mechanisms. For example,
a recent study (Smemo et al., 2014) used 4C data to identify long—
range (at megabase distances) interactions between the obesity—
associated intronic variants in FTO and the homeobox gene IRX3,
with the expression of IRX3 rather than FTO being directly linked
to body mass. This study showcased the value of interactions identi—
fied from the 3C—based studies for shedding light on the functional
mechanisms of genetic variants implicated by GWAS.

Several computational and statistical methods have been de—
veloped for this important peak calling task for data generated from

3C—based methods. Sanyal et al. (2012) developed a 5 C peaking call—
ing algorithm where they first estimated the null contact frequencies
(average and standard deviation) using nonparametric lowess
smoothing over genomic distance (using all pairs with the assump—
tion that the vast majority of interactions are random collisions),
then calculated standardized z—scores and raw P—values by fitting the
z—scores to a Weibull distribution, followed finally by converting the
raw P—values into q—values for FDR analysis. Duan et al. (2010)
binned pairs of loci according to genomic distance, estimated null
contact probabilities within each bin, and called peaks by assuming
the contact frequency of every pair in each bin followed an identical
binomial distribution. Jin et al. (2013) developed a pipeline to esti—
mate the expected contact frequency accounting for locus length, in-
ter—locus distance, mappability and GC content, and then tested for
significant interaction by assuming the observed contact frequency
followed a negative binomial distribution. Most recently, Ay et al.
(2014) refined the binning method in Duan et al. (2010) and to de—
velop Fit-Hi-C. Specifically, Fit—Hi—C provided more accurate esti—
mates of the contact probabilities by fitting nonparametric spline
curves across genomic distances (instead of discrete binning), re-fit-
ting spline curves after filtering non—random collisions based on the
initial spline, and modeling other Hi—C biases by incorporating
locus—specific correction factors inferred from a previously published
iterative correction and eigenvector decomposition method
(Imakaev et al., 2012).

These existing methods have advanced the field by improving
the accuracy in the estimation of the expected contact frequencies
under the null (i.e. random collisions). All these methods take into
account genomic distance between the pair of loci under inference
during the estimation, with some (Ay et al., 2014; Jin et al., 2013)
incorporating other genomic biases. However, all existing methods,
by testing each individual pair of loci independently, ignore the po-
tential correlation among pairs of loci. This was less of an issue with
lower resolution data when multiple fragments combined into meta—
fragments served as the units of analysis.

When analyzing a fragment resolution Hi—C data, Jin et al.
(2013) recognized this potential issue and developed the anchor—
fragment caller (AFC), an ad looc approach to accommodate the cor—
relation of peak status among neighboring fragment pairs. In AFC,
one anchor was fixed (either a fragment or mega-fragment from
consecutive smaller fragments) and one—dimensional peak calling
was performed. For each anchor, the algorithm started with the
identification of candidate peak regions. A candidate peak region
could encompass multiple consecutive fragments with moderate
marginal evidence for non—random interaction with the anchor and,
importantly, AFC allows for small gaps. Peaks were called by aggre—
gating information across the entire candidate peak region via as—
signing thresholds on read counts and P—values from contributing
fragment pairs as well as from the entire region cumulatively. As an
initial attempt to model the spatial dependency of the underlying
peak status, AFC performed reasonably.

We believe that the existing methods are not yet optimal, and
that improvements in multiple aspects are needed. First, an im—
proved analysis suite for data from 3C—derived methods should be
based on an explicit model that yields clear and reproducible expect—
ations for genome—wide interaction frequencies. Second, existing
approaches choose anchor fragment(s) arbitrarily and also ignore
any correlations between neighboring fragments or anchors. For ex-
ample, we found that neighboring anchors often interact with the
same target fragments, suggesting that these anchors are parts of a
bigger region involved in the same DNA looping event. Therefore an
ideal peak caller should consider correlations between neighboring

fragments in the context of a two—dimensional (2D) contact
matrix generated from 3C—derived technologies. Third, one—
dimensional calling approaches are not optimal, do not incorporate
useful existing information, and considerable benefits can be gained
using a 2D approach. For example, we observed AFC asymmetric
peak calls (Supplementary Figs S1 and S2) and lower power in the
identification of non—random interactions (details in Section 3).
Thus, these observations motivated us to develop rigorous statistical
models that efficiently use information from neighbors in the 2D
space.

Here we present a hidden Markov random field (HMRF) based
Bayesian method for peak calling using Hi—C data. Our approach
improves on prior methods by explicitly borrowing information
from neighboring fragment pairs via modeling the dependency in the
2D space. Our results in real data and from extensive simulations in-
dicate superior performance of our method over existing methods,
across a range of underlying dependency structure.

2 Methods
2.1 Notations

Hi—C generates a contact frequency matrix between pairs of frag—
ments. Assume a total of N fragments under consideration. Let 14,-),
1 gi < j g N denote the observed contact frequency between frag—
ment 1' and fragment j. Similarly, let eii, 1 31' < j g N denote the ex—
pected contact frequency between fragment 1' and fragment j under
random collisions. Let the binary indicator variable Zil- take two
possible values 1 and —1 which represent the peak status underlying
fragment pair 1' and j, with Z) = 1 corresponding to a peak (i.e. a
non-random interaction) and Zil- : —1 corresponding a non—peak
(i.e. a random collision event).

2.2 Mixture of negative binomials

We assume that the observed contact frequencies 14,-,- follow a nega—
tive binomial distribution, 14,-,- ~ NB (Ml-i, ¢), where d) is the over—dis—
persion parameter and 14,-,- has mean u),- and variance u),- —I— ul-Zi/d). The
benefit of using a negative binomial distribution (over Poisson or bi—
nomial distribution) is its allowance for over—dispersion, often
observed in Hi—C data (Jin et al., 2013).

Furthermore, we assume that the observed contact frequencies
follow a mixture of negative binomial distributions as a consequence
of the mixture of underlying interaction status Zii’s. Specifically, let
0 > 0 represent the peak to background ratio (signal to noise ratio).
We assume the following on logul-l- :

1 loge,-,- —I— 0, Z,,- : 1
O .. :
gull logeii, Zil- : —1

where e,-,-’s are expected counts under random collision events, esti—
mated using existing methods such as ICE (Imakaev et al., 2012) or
Fit—Hi—C (Ay et al., 2014). Thus we use the following negative bino—
mial mixture distribution:

“if N NB (61,], ee(z,-,~+1)/27 d)»

2.3 Hidden Markov random field (HMRF) model

A HMRF is a generalized hidden Markov model (HMM) in a higher
dimensional space (Besag et al., 1995). Instead of an underlying
Markov chain in HMM, HMRF has an underlying Markov random
field, a set of random variables having a Markov property described
by an undirected graph. HMRF has been applied in genetics,

including evaluation of population structure (Francois et al., 2006),
gene expression data (Stingo and Vannucci, 2011), network—based
genomic discovery (Wei and Pan, 2010) and GWAS (Li et al., 2010).
We use HMRF to account for the local spatial dependency
among adjacent fragment pairs, and simultaneously detect all
2D peaks by borrowing information from neighboring fragment
pairs. Our HMRF modeling is conceptually similar to the employ—
ment of HMM or Bayesian hidden Ising model for peak identifica—
tion from ChIP—Seq data (Choi et al., 2010; Mo, 2012; Qin et al.,
2010), but we extend the modeling from a one dimensional space to
a two dimensional space. In our HMRF model, we adopt the follow—
ing Ising prior (Kindermann et al., 1980) for the binary variable
Zii E {—1,1} representing the unobserved peak status underlying
fragment 1' and fragment j such that Z) only depends on the status of
four neighboring fragment pairs (i—l— 1,j), (i— 1,j), (i,j—I— 1) and
(i,  — 1):

“(Z171)”: , 1£i<iSN,
where (D is the inverse temperature parameter measuring the level
of clustering among Zii’s. The term WW) is the normalizing func-
tion ensuring the probability mass sum to 1. The case (0 = 0 corres—
ponds to independent uniform prior on Zii’s, analogous to the
disordered states at infinite temperature. Large values of (D corres—
pond to more tightly clustered configurations of Zii’s, analogous to
more ordered/correlated states at low temperature. In Hi—C data,
positive clustering is expected, particularly with the high-resolution
Hi—C data where neighboring fragment pairs are likely to
share the underlying peak or non—peak status. Our model explicitly
models the level of clustering and estimates the value of (0 based on
data (Besag et al., 1995). Although our model is expected to mani—
fest its advantages more with clustered hidden states, but, even in
the special case of no clustering, it is unlikely that our model will
incur any power loss if the inverse temperature parameters can be
calibrated to its true value (close to 0 in this case). Supplementary
Figure S3 shows the histogram of domain—specific inverse tempera—
ture estimates from real data at fragment pair level (based on the
peaks reported by AFC), which clearly suggest non—negligible clus-
tering of the peaks for pairs within topological domains (Dixon
et al., 2012; Hou et al., 2012; Li et al., 2012; Nora et al., 2012). In
this work, we focus on the detection of intra—domain interactions,
which account for the vast majority of non—random interactions
(e.g. 95.3% interactions reported by Jin et al. (Jin et al., 2013)
are intra—domain). We followed domain definitions from Dixon
et al. (2012).

2.4 Bayesian inference and the joint probability

We adopt a Bayesian approach (Gelman, 2004) for parameter infer-
ence where the inference is based on the posterior distributions.
Supplementary Material Section 1 provides all details of Bayesian
statistical inference procedure. We will start with specifying the
priors. For convenience and computational efficiency, we make a re—
parameterization: y : dfl. By default, our model uses weak priors
with large variance: a translated gamma distribution for 0:
7t(0) : Gamma(0 — 00;2, 2), a gamma distribution for y : y N G
amma(y; 0.1, 1) and a uniform distribution for 1,0: (0 N Unif(0,1).
To evaluate the impact of priors, we considered other priors and
found little impact on final peaks called (Spearman correlation
> 0.99 on average, detailed in Supplementary Material Section 3).
Note that 00 is fixed to ensure model identifiability (we use
00 = 0.5 by default). The likelihood is fully specified based on the

We used Metropolis—Hastings algorithm (detailed in Supplementary
Material Section 1.1) to infer all parameters except the inverse tem—
perature parameter 1,0, which is estimated using a pseudo—likelihood
approach (detailed in Supplementary Material Section 1.2).

3 Results

Comprehensive simulation studies have demonstrated the superior
performance of our HMRF Bayesian caller over other available
methods. In particular, our simulations showed that our model is
able to accurately estimate the inverse temperature parameter (0
across a wide range of spatially dependent patterns and as a result
improved power for calling peaks (detailed in Supplementary
Material Section 2). Next, we showcase the improved reproducibil—
ity and statistical power of our method in real data analysis. As
aforementioned, our method was motivated by our observations in
real data and was developed for re—analysis of the fragment reso—
lution Hi—C data generated by Jin et al. (2013). In the original study,
twelve replicates of primary IMR90 human fibroblast cells (includ—
ing six replicates untreated cells and six replicates after TNF—oc treat—
ment) were used to generate ~3.4 billion paired—end reads. This
unprecedented sequencing depth allowed direct identification of
interacting fragments. One major finding of this study is that TNF—
oc responsive enhancers are already in contact with their target pro—
moters before signaling, manifested by similar peak patterns
observed under each condition separately. Motivated by this finding
and the insufficient sequencing depth in each condition (i.e. before
or after TNF— or treatment), we combined data from the two condi—
tions to achieve higher statistical power in detecting fragment reso—
lution chromatin interaction.

We thus first test our HMRF Bayesian caller in this Hi—C data
set. We analyzed three datasets (1) IMR90 before TNF—oc treatment,
(2) IMR90 after TNF—oc treatment and (3) the combined dataset
(dataset by pooling data from datasets 1 and 2). Under the rationale
that peak patterns of the two conditions are shared, a robust
caller is expected to identify similar patterns for the three datasets.
Figure 1 shows peak calling results from one domain chr17:29.52—
29.72 Mb. We observed that fewer peaks were called in datasets 1
and 2, particularly dataset 1 where the total number of reads was
75.1% of that in the dataset 2. Comparatively, our method encour—
ages more clustering of peaks and more consistent results across the
three datasets. For example, within this particular domain, 40.6%
and 69.9% of the peaks called in the combined dataset were de—
tected using only dataset 1 and 2, respectively, by our method, com—
pared with 35.3% and 65.2% (40.3% and 67.9%) by AFC (Fit—Hi-
C). Genome—wide quantitative comparisons are presented below
(Tables 1 and 2).

We next proceeded to quantitatively and systematically evaluate
the performance based on genome—wide calling for all domains. For a
fair comparison, we selected thresholds based on posterior peak proba—
bilities for our method and P—values for Fit—Hi—C to match the number
of peaks called by AFC for each dataset. We also performed other com—
parisons where we matched the number of peaks called by either our
method or Fit—Hi—C, or where we let each method call peaks according
to its own criterion and found similar patterns (detailed in
Supplementary Material Section 5). Treating peaks called in the com—
bined dataset as truth, we gauged performance in single—condition data—
sets using the following three statistics: false—positive rate (FPR), false
discovery rate (FDR) and recovery rate (RR). Denote the number of
false positives, true positives, false negatives and true negatives as FP,
TP, FN and TN, where the truth is defined according to AFC results
from the combined dataset and the four numbers sum up to the total
number of intra—domain fragment pairs. We have FPR : FP/(FP —1— TN),
FDR : FP/(FP —1— TP) and RR : TP/(TP —1— TN). As shown in Table 1
upper panel, methods accounting for potential dependency of underly—
ing peak statuses (AFC and our HMRF Bayesian caller) resulted in bet—
ter performance than Fit-Hi—C which models fragment pairs
independently. Furthermore, our method outperformed the others for
all three measures. For example, for IMR90 before TNF—oc treatment,
we obtained FPR:0.52%, FDR: 15.6% and RR=42.3% for our
HMRF Bayesian caller, compared with FPR: 0.60%, FDR: 18.4%
and RR=41.1% for AFC and FPR: 0.64%, FDR: 19.2% and
RR = 41.2% for Fit-Hi-C. By borrowing information from neighboring
fragment pairs in a probabilistic framework, our method lead to more
robust inference with simultaneously lower false positive, false discov—
ery rates and higher recovery rate.

In addition, for each caller, we calculated the Jaccard Index
(Hamers et al., 1989) between the peak sets from the two condi—
tions, defined as the ratio of number of peaks identified under both
conditions over the number of peaks identified by either. Average
Jaccard Index across all domains genome—wide is shown in Table 2
for each method. Again, methods accounting for the dependency of
underlying peak status show higher concordance across conditions.
Average Jaccard Index improved by 33.6% and 61.3% respectively,
from 13.7% (Fit-Hi-C) to 18.4% (AFC) and 22.1% (HMRF).

To avoid potential systematic differences between treated and
untreated conditions in terms of peak status (although not supported
by results in Jin et al. (2013)), we also analyzed two randomly split
datasets as described by Jin et al. (2013). Results shown in Table 1
(lower panel) and Table 2 (rightmost column) similarly show better
reproducibility and robustness of our methods over existing ones.

Given one important utility of called peaks is to illuminate biologic—
ally meaningful interactions, we directly evaluated the power to iden—
tify one important category of biological interactions: between
enhancers and transcription start sites (TSS). We used the enhancer—
promoter connection map based on multi—tissue correlations between
distal and promoter chromatin accessibility (Thurman et al., 2012),
augmented with results from multi—tissue correlations between chroma—
tin accessibility and gene expression (Sheffield et al., 2013), retrieved
from http://dnase.med.unc.edu/supplement/allGeneCorrelations100000
.p2.txt.gz. We left Fit—Hi—C out in the comparison as it showed incom—
parable reproducibility with the other callers. Supplementary Figure S4
demonstrates the increased power of HMRF over AFC with up to
11.3% more enhancer—TSS interactions identified by HMRF, given the
same number of peak regions called by two methods. In addition,
Supplementary Figure S5 shows one particular example where the po—
tential target gene CTSB (Maurano et al., 2012) of a GWAS variant
rs1600249 (Freudenberg et al., 2011) was missed by AFC but captured
by our method.

Assuming calling result for the combined dataset is the true peak pattern,
we summarized the following measures for 1432 domains, i.e. genome-wide.
We reported the genome-wide average of false-positive rate (FPR), false dis-
covery rate (FDR) and recovery rate (RR) by the HMRF-Bayesian method,
AFC method and Fit-Hi-C for both IMR90 before TNF-(x treatment and
IMR90 after TNF-(x treatment. We found that the HMRF-Bayesian method
has better performance than AFC method and Fit-Hi-C

In addition, we performed transcription factor binding sites
(TFBS) and active TSS (reported by Jin et al., 2013) enrichment

data using the computational pipeline developed by the ENCODE
project (Gerstein et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2013). We found that re—
gardless of the detection threshold (ranging from 1 in 100 000 frag-
ment pairs called as peaks to 1 in 100), the pairs of interacting
fragments called are significantly enriched with TFBS and active TSS
(XZ P-value < 10438) with ~42% identified peak pairs overlapping
with TFBS while ~28% identified non-peak pairs overlapping with
TFBS (Fig. 2). In addition, we found that fragments overlapping
with TFBS or active TSS are involved in a slightly (but statistically
significant) larger number of interactions than those not overlapping
with TFBS or active TSS (Supplementary Fig. S6).

Finally, we applied our methods to two other datasets: the mouse
embryonic stem cell (mESC) and human embryonic stem cell (H1-
hESC) dataset (Dixon et al., 2012). For both datasets, we down—
loaded observed Hi—C count data from the Fit—Hi—C website and esti—
mated the expected counts using Fit—Hi—C. For mESC, genome—wide
ChIA—PET data are available (Zhang et al., 2013) and for H1—hESC,
5 C data were generated in 44 regions by the ENCODE pilot project
(Sanyal et al., 2012). We gauged performance of our methods and of
Fit—Hi—C by comparison with results from data generated from inde—
pendent technologies. Comparison results suggest our method was
able to detect more interactions captured from 5 C (Supplementary
Fig. S7a) or ChIA—PET (Supplementary Fig. S7b) data with the same
number of peak regions called, according to HMRF posterior peak
probabilities or Fit—Hi—C P—values.

4 Discussion

Peak calling from data generated by 3C—derived methods is a funda—
mental task for the identification of chromatin interactions in 3D
space. However, model—based methods for this important task are
still lacking. Existing methods focus on the calibration of expected
count frequency distribution under random collision, accounting for
multiple biases behind 3C analysis including but not limited to dens—
ity of restriction enzyme sites, mappability and GC content. We have
found existing methods rather mature for the purpose of calibrating
expected counts (with results robust to different methods used).
Establishing the expected count distribution is nevertheless a pre—
requisite, not peak calling itself. None of the existing methods con—
sider the dependency underlying the peak status with statistical rigor.
In this work, we propose a HMRF based Bayesian method that
explicitly models the dependency of the underlying peak pattern.
The true peak pattern is unknown and can take different forms in
the presence of dependency. We simplify the problem by assuming
an Ising distribution prior and learn the level of dependency from
data in a Bayesian framework. Our extensive simulations indicate
superior performance in terms of both the estimation of the extent
of dependency and the statistical power to distinguish peaks from
background, across a range of underlying dependency patterns.
There are several aspects where the model can be further elabo—
rated. First, our model has one 0, one (D and one d), thus assuming
that peaks are of similar strength and clustering patterns, and that

reads have similar levels of over—dispersion. While the first two are
simplifying assumptions bypassing issues including model selection
difficulty and parameter non—identifiability, the last has been shown
to be reasonable (Jin et al., 2013). Sensitivity analysis with the IMR90
combined dataset suggests these assumptions are reasonable: splitting
each domain into two equal sub—domains resulted in highly consistent
peak calls (Spearman correlation > 0.9, detailed in Supplementary
Material Section 4). Second, we use a one—parameter Ising prior, with
the parameter controlling both the peak proportion and level of de—
pendency. A two—parameter Ising prior would allow more ﬂexibility,
particularly when the underlying dependency is weak. Third, our
method could allow incorporation of prior knowledge, when avail-
able, into the model. For instance, a hyper prior could be imposed on
the inverse temperature parameter based on estimated distribution
from similar existing datasets. Finally, the computational complexity
of our Bayesian modeling is quadratic in terms of the number of frag-
ments under consideration. Our JAVA implementation takes ~13 mi-
nutes for a typical domain with 200 fragments and with parallel
computing, genome—wide analysis can be easily accomplished within
a few hours. In contrast, Fit—Hi—C and our R implementation of AFC
take N4 seconds and ~12 minutes, respectively. Therefore, for future
work, computationally more efficient algorithms warrant consider—
ation. We attempted to apply the iterative conditional mode algo—
rithm (Li et al., 2010), but observed unsatisfactory performance with
weak peak signals (data not shown).

Despite these possible further model improvements, our method
has demonstrated favorable performance over existing methods by
borrowing information from neighboring fragment pairs via statis—
tically modeling the potential dependency among the underlying
peaks using a Bayesian framework. Our extensive simulation studies
(Supplementary Material Section 2) show the advantage of our
method across a range of dependency patterns and its ability to learn
the level of dependency (as modeled by the inverse temperature par—
ameter) from data. Both are valuable since we have limited, if any,
prior knowledge regarding the extent of dependency in real data.
Re—analysis of several published Hi—C datasets including the IMR90,
H1-hESC and mESC data confirmed the value of dependency mod—
eling as taking dependency into consideration resulted in better con—
cordance (>40% improvement as measured by Jaccard Index of
peak sets across two IMR90 datasets) and lower false positive, false
discovery rates and higher recovery rate. Our method is the first to
model dependency in a statistically rigorous manner and to borrow

information from neighboring fragment pairs through a probabilis-
tic model, was able to call up to 11.3% more enhancer—TSS inter-
actions than the ad hoc method given the same number of peak
regions called. We acknowledge that there is currently no genome—
wide gold standard for real data (for example, from large scale gen-
ome—wide imaging—based experiments). We therefore made special
efforts to benchmark the methods across multiple datasets and for
each dataset, against the most reasonable silver standard. For ex—
ample, for the IMR90 cell lines, we compared against results from
the combined dataset with the highest sequencing depth, for H1
hESC and mESC, we used results from independent technologies
(5 C and ChIA—PET, respectively).

With the continuing drop in sequencing costs and the intensive
interest in chromatin structure as a way to understand GWAS re—
sults, we anticipate in the near future more high-resolution (frag-
ment—level) Hi—C data where our method have demonstrated key
advantage given the non—negligible dependency structure.

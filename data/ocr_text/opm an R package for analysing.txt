ABSTRACT

Summary: opm is an R package designed to analyse multidimensional
OmniLog® phenotype microarray (PM) data. opm provides manage-
ment, visualization and statistical analysis of PM data, including curve-
parameter estimation and discretization, dedicated and customizable
plots, metadata management, automated generation of textual and
tabular reports, mapping of substrates to databases, batch conversion
of files and export to phylogenetic software in the YAML markup
language.

Availability: opm is distributed under the GPL through the
Comprehensive R Archive Network (http://cran.r-project.org/pack
age=opm) along with a comprehensive manual and a user-friendly
tutorial. Further information may be found at http://www.dsmz.de/re
search/microorganisms/projectsl.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput phenotypic testing is increasingly important for
exploring the biology of bacteria, fungi, yeasts and animal cell
lines, e. g. human cancer cells (Bochner, 2009), and offers a great
potential for testing gene function and improving genome anno-
tation (Bochner et al., 2001). The OmniLog® PM system moni-
tors simultaneously, on a longitudinal time scale, the phenotypic
reaction to up to 2000 environmental challenges spotted on sets
of 96-well microtiter plates (Bochner, 2009) as respiration kin-
etics with an often sigmoidal shape.

As we discussed previously, by using a combination of existing
R packages, ad hoc code and even manual manipulations Waas
et al., 2012), there is an increasing demand to explore OmniLog®
PM data not only qualitatively but also quantitatively, taking
into account associated metadata on the organisms and experi-
mental settings. As a result, we present here the broad and ﬂex-
ible design of the R (R Development Core Team, 2012) package
opm, which allows users to analyse OmniLog® PM data within a
wide frame of research tasks such as -omics approaches, systems
biology, ecology and taxonomy.

2 FEATURES
2.1 Data input and storage

The raw kinetic values can be imported from CSV [from the
OmniLog® or MicroStationTM reader (BiOLOG Inc., 2009)],
or YAML (http://www.yaml.org/; used by opm itself), yielding
S4 objects (Chambers, 1998). These containers comprise one
object per input plate (with the measurements and the few meta-
data output by the OmniLog® software) and optionally esti-
mated curve parameters together with the estimate settings,
and/ or additional metainformation on the experiment. Batch
conversion of large numbers of ﬁles (optionally non-interactively
via Rscript) and parallel computation is supported. R func-
tions and experimental examples are provided and described in
great detail in the manual and the user-friendly tutorial. The
main opm workﬂow as described later in the text is summarized
in Figure 1.

2.2 Data enrichment

Important biological information stored in the raw curve kinetics
can be summarized in the curve parameters lag phase (A), steep-
ness of slope (,u), maximum curve height (A) and area under the
curve (AUC), using a fast and approximate method (only A and
AUC) or spline-ﬁt algorithms (Eilers et al., 1996; Kahm et al.,
2010; Wood, 2006). Fitting splines rather than growth models is
more robust for these data (Vaas et al., 2012). Conﬁdence inter-
vals can be obtained via bootstrapping or aggregating pre-
deﬁned groups. To enable PM data analysis with respect to
such organismal or experimental features, the user may include
to the objects any metadata of interest for each 96-well plate.

2.3 Data manipulation and export

Objects can be indexed for speciﬁc plates, time points of meas-
urements or wells. The stored metainformation can be modiﬁed
and queried with speciﬁc functions or inﬁx operators. This
allows for easy and ﬂexible subsetting of objects based on any
combination of metadata keys and values and on positive versus
negative reactions. The aggregated or discretizea’ curve param-
eters can be extracted into a matrix or data frame for any further
analysis outside opm but within R. For storage in ﬁles or

databases and exchange between laboratories self-describing

2.4 Graphical and statistical analysis

High-quality graphical visualizations of either the raw kinetic
measurements or curve parameters are indispensable for quanti-
tative analysis of PM data. Therefore, functions for level plots,
x/y plots, conﬁdence interval plots, heat maps and radial plots
have been integrated. Plots can be easily annotated with the
stored metainformation. Statistical comparison of multiple
groups (Hothorn et al., 2008) deﬁned by stored metainformation
is also straightforward. Data conversions allow for user-deﬁned
visualization strategies based on, e.g. lattice (Sarkar, 2008).

2.5 Data discretization and report generation

The continuous curve parameter data can be converted to dis-
crete values in several ways for the export of character data to
software for inferring character evolution or phylogenies
(Goloboff et al., 2008; Stamatakis et al., 2005; Swofford, 2003).
For a qualitative classiﬁcation of the curves into negative and
positive (optionally also weak/ambiguous) reactions relevant for
assessing gene function and annotation (Bochner et al., 2001) or
for prokaryote taxonomy, several approaches are available. The
results can be displayed as HTML tables or text suitable, e.g. for
scientiﬁc journals (Fiebig et al., 2013; Montero-Calasanz et al.,
2012).

2.6 Substrate information provided by 0pm

Almost all OmniLog® and MicroStationTM plates are supported
regarding the mapping of wells to standardized substrate names.
To further explore PM data regarding gene function and anno-
tation, CAS, KEGG (http://www.genome.jp/kegg/), MeSH
(http://www.ncbi.n1m.nih.gov/mesh) and Metacyc (http://meta
cyc.org/) IDs are supplied for each substrate as far as available
from literature.

3 CONCLUSION

The unique strength of opm is the qualitative and quantitative
analysis of raw kinetic OmniLog® PM data via direct visualiza-
tion and the robust estimation of curve parameters and their
conﬁdence intervals. Thereby, the user retains full control on
the directions of data analyses according to his research interests.
Flexible ways to add and query metainformation enable the user
to efﬁciently explore these data statistically, also across multiple
groups. Export to matrices and data frames allows for the ex-
ploitation of all functionality available in the R environment,
whereas standardized and easily readable output formats ease
the interaction with external software.

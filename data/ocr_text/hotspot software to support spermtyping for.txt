Abstract

Motivation: In many organisms, including humans, recombination clusters within recombination hot-
spots. The standard method for de novo detection of recombinants at hotspots is sperm typing. This
relies on allele-specific PCR at single nucleotide polymorphisms. Designing allele-specific primers by
hand is time-consuming. We have therefore written a package to support hotspot detection and analysis.
Results: hotspot consists of four programs: asp looks up SNPs and designs allele-specific primers;
aso constructs allele-specific oligos for mapping recombinants; xov implements a maximum-
Iikelihood method for estimating the crossover rate; six, finally, simulates typing data.

1 Introduction

Understanding recombination is one of the classic problems in biol-
ogy (Maynard Smith, 1978). In the past decade, the quantitative
underpinnings of the debate about the function of recombination
have dramatically improved as a result of population genomics
based on genome sequencing. A major result of such studies is that
in many organisms, including humans, recombination is localized in
recombination hotspots (Hinch et al., 2011; Myers et al., 2005).
Still, direct observation by typing of the products of recombin-
ation—usually sperm cells—is highly desirable to check and refine
the results of population genetic inference (Jeffreys et al., 2005;
Odenthal-Hesse et al., 2014).

Sperm typing is usually carried out after determining SNPs in a
genomic region (Fig. 1A). Given a set of SNPs, linkage disequilib-
rium (LD) can be computed between pairs of them leading to the
discovery of LD blocks punctuated by hotspot candidate regions a
few kb wide. The best-known method for measuring the frequency
of crossover at a candidate hotspot is the full-crossover assay
(Fig. 1B), where allele-specific primers are designed against SNPs
located upstream and downstream of the putative recombination
hotspot (ASPs, Fig. 1B). Nested sets of phased ASPs are then used in

repulsion phase on pools of sperm DNA, such that only molecules
affected by a crossover are amplified (Kauppi et al., 2009). To map
the crossover breakpoints, the SNPs of the amplification product are
typed using allele-specific oligos (ASOs).

Recombination results in crossovers as well as non-crossovers,
which are characterized by short, non-reciprocal gene conversion
tracts. Both types of recombinants can be simultaneously detected
by modifying the full-crossover assay such that one of the two sets
of allele-specific primers is replaced by a set of universal primers
(Fig. 1C). The resulting half-crossover assay allows the selective
amplification of either haplotype targeted. Recombinant molecules
are isolated by sequential ASO hybridization to each SNP within the
hotspot interval using ASOs complementary to the haplotype not
amplified. Under this protocol, hybridization products may still be
due to crossovers (Fig. 1C, 01). However, any stretch of the haplo-
type not amplified that is detected without the exchange of flanking
markers must be the result of a non-crossover event (Fig. 1C, 02).

SNP annotation and the design of ASPs, A505 and universal pri-
mers are typically done by hand, which is slow and error-prone, es-
pecially when screening many hotspot candidates. We have written
the software package hotspot to assist with this.

sequencing, SNP discovery and linkage disequilibrium (LD) estimation for iden-
tifying LD blocks flanking hotspot candidates. (B) Full-crossover assay. Nested
PCR is carried out across a hotspot candidate with allele-specific primers con-
structed using our program asp. This leads to positive PCR reactions indicating
crossovers, and to negative PCR reactions indicating no crossover. The cartoon
shows an example positive reaction, where the crossover region (1) is identified
using allele-specific oligos constructed with our program aso. C: Half-crossover
assay. Allele-specific primers (red) are paired with universal primers (black).
PCR and SNP typing can then lead to the detection of crossover (O1) and non-
crossover (02) events. Adapted from Figs 20.1 and 20.5 by Kauppi et al. (2009)

2 Individual programs

hotspot consists of four programs: asp for designing allele-specific
primers, aso for designing allele-specific oligos, xov for estimating
the crossover rate and six for simulating crossover data. All four
programs are command-line driven and run under UNIX operating
systems such as Linux and OS-X.

asp takes three kinds of input: a list of candidate regions, the
SNPs of the target genome and the genome sequence. Given these
three inputs, asp returns candidate forward and reverse primers
ﬂanking both sides of the recombination hotspot. As explained
above, these primers can be used for amplifying recombination
products either in full-crossover assays (Fig. 1B), or half-crossover
assays (Fig. 1C). The primers are constructed for every SNP in a
5 kb window adjacent to the candidate region. The 3’-end of each
primer overlaps either of the two SNP alleles. asp optimizes primer
length with respect to GC content. Apart from the primer sequences
and the GC content, the program also prints out the melting tem-
perature. Finally, asp can generate uniformly spaced ‘universal’ pri-
mers that do not intersect known polymorphisms for haplotype
amplification in the half-crossover assay.

To look up SNPs, asp calls the program tabix (Li, 2010), which
is part of the samtools package (Li et al., 2009). This makes asp fast;
for example, it takes only 10.85 on a Xeon 2.60GHz system to

construct forward primers for all 98 692 SNPs contained in the 5 kb
upstream regions of 753 hotspot candidates identified on mouse
chromosome 1 by Smagulova et al. (2011).

aso also takes as input a list of hotspot candidates, SNPs and
genome sequences. Using tabix (Li, 2010), it then looks up each SNP
in the candidate region and returns two short (e. g. 17 bp) oligos
that straddle both alleles of the SNP. These are used to map cross-
over as well as non-crossover breakpoints (X in Fig. 1B and C). aso
needs just 9.6 s to construct allele-specific oligos for the same 98 692
SNPs analyzed with asp in the previous paragraph.

Again, like asp, aso can generate evenly spaced oligos that do not
overlap SNPs. These ‘universals’ tend to be longer than the allele-spe-
cific oligos, say 100 bp. They can be used as capture probes for in-solu-
tion enrichment. However, such oligos may come from low
complexity regions in the genome, which would cause unspecific en-
richment. To allow filtering for low complexity, aso also computes a
measure based on the Lempel-Ziv complexity (Lempel and Ziv, 1976).

xov implements a maximum likelihood procedure for estimating
the crossover probability from results of allele-specific PCR
(Fig. 1B). In a typical screen, m experiments with different numbers
of molecules, d,, are carried out with n,- PCR reactions leading to the
observation of k,- blanks. xov comes with example data to demon-
strate how these quantities are entered.

six was written to check the accuracy of xov by simulating sperm
typing results. It allows the user to modify all three relevant vari-
ables in the design of sperm typing studies: the number of experi-
ments (m), including the number of molecules per experiment (d,);
the number of replicates per experiment (n,-); and the crossover rate
(x). Apart from checking xov, six can be used to test the efficacy of
experimental setups to detect a given recombination rate.

In conclusion, hotspot enables large-scale design of allele-specific
oligos and accurate estimation of the rate of crossing over. In add-
ition, it allows exploration of typing designs through simulation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Genetic association studies making use of high-throughput
genotyping arrays need to process large amounts of data in the order
of millions of markers per experiment. The first step of any analysis
with genotyping arrays is typically the conduct of a thorough data
clean up and quality control to remove poor quality genotypes and
generate metrics to inform and select individuals for downstream stat-
istical analysis. We have developed pyGenClean, a bioinformatics tool
to facilitate and standardize the genetic data clean up pipeline with
genotyping array data. In conjunction with a source batch-queuing
system, the tool minimizes data manipulation errors, accelerates the
completion of the data clean up process and provides informative
plots and metrics to guide decision making for statistical analysis.
Availability and implementation: pyGenClean is an open source
Python 2.7 software and is freely available, along with documentation
and examples, from http://www.statgen.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome-wide association studies and similar designs typically
rely on the use of massive amounts of genotype data covering
the genome of thousands of study participants. Before proceed-
ing to statistical analysis with genotyping array data, quality
control (QC) and data clean up are usually performed to identify
poorly performing samples and failed genotypes and to produce
the analysis set according to set genetic ancestry criteria. This
is particularly important for association tests, which can be
sensitive to even small sources of systematic or random errors.
When joined with large sample size and a large number of geno-
typed markers, small errors can cause loss of statistical power
and spurious associations. Hence, a thorough QC is required,
even though it might become computationally intensive
(Turner et al., 2011). PLINK (Purcell et al., 2007) is a tool
widely used for quality assessment (Anderson et al., 2010;
Laurie et al., 2010; Turner et al., 2011), providing multiple qual-
ity metrics about markers and samples that allows efﬁcient data
management. Even though PLINK is a complete toolset, it lacks
automation, and some steps require a considerable amount of

manual tuning. pyGenClean automates the QC procedure using
PLINK, while providing the user with multiple summarization
ﬁles and visual aids for quick identiﬁcation of quality issues.
It also allows for the parallelization of steps for servers with a
DRMAA—compliant distributed resource management system.
The tool consists of multiple stand-alone scripts that are linked
together via a main script and a conﬁguration ﬁle, the latter
facilitating user customization.

2 METHODS

The QC pipeline was designed to respond to the needs of users for quality
assessment tools of both the samples and their markers, historical process
logs, speed and parametrization. Different QC protocols have also been
previously described in the literature (Anderson et al., 2010; Laurie et al.,
2010; Turner et al., 2011). Our QC pipeline is constructed from a set
of script modules, which can be parameterized and ordered according
to speciﬁc project needs. Figure 1 displays the recommended pipeline
structure, designed to optimize the QC and minimize sample loss. The
procedures can be separated in two classes: marker and sample QC
procedures.

The marker QC consists of seven scripts [Fig l (in dark blue, see
online version)]. The duplicated_snps module ﬁnds duplicated markers
according to their chromosomal location (even if they have unique IDs).
It computes the completion and the overall concordance of each dupli-
cates and evaluates the possibility of merging the data of the duplicate
markers when concordance criteria are met while zeroing out discordant
genotypes. As multi—allelic markers would appear to be duplicated in the
dataset, the script will preserve incompatible duplicates. The
noCall_hetero_snps module removes any marker with a heterozygosity
rate (excluding the MT markers) or a missing rate of 100%. The
snp_missingness module removes all the markers with a missing rate
that is higher than the user-deﬁned threshold. The plate_bias module
removes marker showing signiﬁcant plate bias as assessed by the com-
parison of allele frequencies from one plate to all others. The remove_—
heterozygous_haploid module zeroes out heterozygous haploid markers.
The ﬂag_maf_zero module ﬂags markers with a minor allele frequency of
zero. The ﬁag_hw module ﬂags markers that fail Hardy—Weinberg
equilibrium.

The sample QC steps consist of ﬁve scripts [Fig l (in light blue, see
online version)]. The duplicated_samples module helps in comparing
duplicated samples with identical identiﬁers (IDs). As the PLINK pro-
gram requires unique IDs, input ﬁles for this script consist of transposed
PLINK pedﬁles (separated by tabulations), and the script performs the
required computations. It computes the completion and the overall con-
cordance of each duplicates and evaluates the possibility of merging the
data of the duplicate IDs when concordance criteria are met and by
zeroing out discordant genotypes. The sample_missingness module will

remove all the samples that have a missing rate higher than a user-deﬁned
threshold. The sex_check module uses PLINK’s check sex options to
compare gender registered in the input ﬁles and the gender deduced by
their X chromosome heterozygosity rate. Using all samples, the script
also produces a graph showing the summarized Y intensities in function
of the summarized X intensities of all samples, highlighting problematic
samples (Laurie et al., 2010; Turner et al., 2011). The script also produces
a plot showing the overall log R ratio and B allele frequency (BAF) for
both X and Y chromosomes of problematic samples, helping in the iden-
tiﬁcation of allelic imbalance (Laurie et al., 2010) and in estimating the
number of X and Y chromosomes. Finally, the script computes the het-
erozygosity rate on the X chromosome and the number of missing calls
on the Y chromosome, helping in the resolution of possible gender mix
ups. The ﬁnd_related_samples module uses PLINK’s genome option to
estimate the relatedness of study participants using identity-by—descent
and identity-by—state for each sample pairs. It ﬁnds the possible degree
of relatedness using the Cotterman coefﬁcients as estimated by PLINK
(Z0, Z1 and Z2). The script also computes the IBS2jali0 to produce two
plots of Z0 and Z1 in function of IBS2jali0 (above a user deﬁned thresh-
old) (Stevens et al., 2011). Those plots provide visual support for the
identiﬁcation of sample pair relatedness (Fig. 2). Finally, the script
offers the possibility of randomly selecting one sample of each related
group, excluding other related samples from the ﬁnal dataset. The
check_ethnicity module uses the PLINK program to compute the multi-
dimensional scaling (MDS) values of the samples. This method requires a

pairwise identity-by—descent matrix to be computed, which can be com-
putationally demanding. Using parallelization, the pyGenClean script
efﬁciently computes the MDS values using PLINK and, with the addition
of reference populations (such as CEU, YRI and JPT—CHB), will ﬁnd
outliers with respect to a user-deﬁned reference population and will create
MDS graphs. The outlier’s detection script uses the standard deviation of
each cluster found by a K—Means algorithm.

Two additional scripts are provided for the automation of the QC
pipeline. The ﬁrst one, subset, helps to subset the dataset by excluding
or selecting a set of markers or samples. The second one, compare _gold_
standard, compares the current dataset with a gold standard. For
example, if some samples from the 1000 Genomes Project were geno-
typed, the script compares the study genotypes with those of the reference
1000 Genomes Project data. If needed, markers are ﬂipped according to
their minor allele for comparability.

3 APPLICATION

A dataset comprising 6528 samples (including multiple duplicates
of four HapMap samples and internal control samples) genotyped
at the Beaulieu-Saucier Pharmacogenomics Centre on the
Illumina HumanOmni2.5Exome BeadChip (2567845 markers
including 42 822 duplicated markers) was processed with
pyGenClean. A parameter ﬁle, as described in Figure 1, was cre-
ated and used on a cluster with 10 nodes of 8 Intel® Xeon® CPUs
at 2.40 GHz (with hyper-threading) and 47 GB of random access
memory for each node. The sample_missingness module was run
two times (with 10 and 2% of missing calls thresholds), and the
snp_missingness module was run in between to minimize data
loss. To optimize computation speed, the duplicated_samples
module was run independently of the others, and some script
was run in parallel on the cluster. All other scripts were run
with default parameters.

After 4 days of computation (including manual veriﬁcation
time), the ﬁnal dataset after QC consisted of 2059 052 markers
genotyped on 5749 unique samples. Note that the full power of
the cluster is used only for the relatedness and the ethnic mod-
ules, as only a maximum of four processes were used in parallel
for the other modules.

As genetic datasets are getting larger, efﬁcient genetic data QC
and clean up procedures are required. pyGenClean ensures quick,
customizable and traceable results with datasets of any size.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Stable isotope-labelling experiments have recently gained
increasing popularity in metabolomics studies, providing unique in-
sights into the dynamics of metabolic fluxes, beyond the steady-
state information gathered by routine mass spectrometry. However,
most liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry data analysis soft-
ware Iacks features that enable automated annotation and relative
quantification of labelled metabolite peaks. Here, we describe
szatch—ISO, a new extension to the metabolomics analysis pipeline
szatch.R.

Results: Targeted and untargeted isotope profiling using szatch—
ISO provides a convenient visual summary of the quality and quantity
of labelling for every metabolite through four types of diagnostic plots
that show (i) the chromatograms of the isotope peaks of each com-
pound in each sample group; (ii) the ratio of mono-isotopic and
labelled peaks indicating the fraction of labelling; (iii) the average
peak area of mono-isotopic and labelled peaks in each sample
group; and (iv) the trend in the relative amount of labelling in a pre-
determined isotopomer. To aid further statistical analyses, the values
used for generating these plots are also provided as a tab-delimited
file. We demonstrate the power and versatility of szatch—ISO by
analysing a 13C-Iabelled metabolome dataset from trypanosomal
parasites.

Availability: szatch.R and szatch—ISO are available free of
charge from http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net and can be used on
Linux and Windows platforms running the latest version of R.

1 INTRODUCTION

Liquid chromatography—mass spectrometry (LC—MS) is a tech-
nique that combines the physical separation capabilities of liquid
chromatography with the highly sensitive mass detection proper-
ties of mass spectrometry. Metabolomics studies use LC—MS for
the global detection and relative quantiﬁcation of metabolites in
complex biological samples. Recently, LC—MS has been applied
to trace the metabolism of stable isotope-labelled metabolic
precursors in biological systems as a function of time
(Supplementary Fig. S1) (Chaneton et al., 2012; Le et al.,
2012). Such experiments can provide unique insights into the
dynamics of metabolic ﬂuxes, beyond the steady-state informa-
tion gathered by routine metabolomics.

Stable isotope-labelled metabolites possess the same chro-
matographic properties as their unlabelled counterparts and
can be readily identiﬁed from the MS dataset based on
their expected mass (Fig. 1). However, a key challenge that
metabolomics researchers face is the limited number of suit-
able bioinformatic solutions for metabolome-wide isotope-
labelled data analyses. Multiple MS data analysis tools are
available (Dunn et al., 2012), including widely used open
source software such as szine (mzmine.sourceforge.net),
szatch (mzmatch.sourceforge.net) and XCMS (metlin.-
scripps.edu), and commercial software such as SIEVE (www.
thermo.com), MassHunter (www.chem.agilent.com) and
MarkerLynx (www.waters.com). Although they are all capable
of identifying and quantifying metabolites of interest in un-
labelled data, features that enable the extraction and relative
quantiﬁcation of isotope peaks from labelled data either re-
quire manual intervention or are non-existent. Furthermore,
software that can handle labelled MS data, such as
MetExtract (Bueschl et al., 2012) and MAVEN (Melamud
et al., 2010), lacks appropriate peak-picking algorithms in
the processing pipeline. Here, we present a novel and
unique tool, szatch—ISO, that circumvents these bottlenecks
by performing fully automated targeted or untargeted annota-
tion and relative quantiﬁcation of mono-isotopic and corre-
sponding isotope-labelled peaks of metabolites in stable

Fig. 1. A representative example of an unlabelled peak (ﬁrst peak) and its
corresponding 13C—labelled peaks. These peaks elute at the same retention
time, but their masses differ by the difference in the mass of heavy and
light carbon. Filled circles show the number of labelled carbons that each
peak represent

isotope-labelled LC—MS data to generate plots and tables that
describe the labelling pattern in detail.

The ability to generate a comprehensive graphical Visualiza-
tion of the output along with the extensible and scriptable nature
of the software itself makes szatch—ISO a unique data analy-
sis tool for isotope-labelling studies. szatch—ISO is an exten-
sion to szatch, an open-source Java toolbox for MS data
processing and Visualization (Scheltema et al., 2011). Features
of szatch—enabled by the R package szatch.R—including
the new PeakML data exchange format and the data analysis
pipeline were described by Scheltema et al. (2011). szatch has
been applied to many metabolomics data analyses (J ankevics
et al., 2011; t’Kindt et al., 2010) and is the underlying platform
for software such as IDEOM (Creek et al., 2012). Currently, only
LC—MS data analysis is supported by szatch—ISO; however, it
is possible to process gas chromatography—mass spectrometry
data analyses using mzmatch.R and mzmatch—ISO with some
additional scripting.

2 METHODS

Isotope proﬁling using szatch—ISO requires the LC—MS raw data
(.szML) ﬁles to be preprocessed by extracting the peaks using XCMS
(Smith et al., 2006) and aligning, noise ﬁltering and gap-ﬁlling peaks into a
combined PeakML ﬁle containing all samples using szatch.R. In add-
ition to the PeakML ﬁle, targeted proﬁling requires an additional tab-de-
limited input text ﬁle containing the list of compounds of interest (see
Supplementary Fig. S2). This list can also contain characteristic adducts
or fragments of metabolites of interest where appropriate. Automated
targeted and untargeted isotope proﬁling can be performed using the
szatch—ISO functions PeakML.Isotope.TargettedIsotopes() and
PeakML.Isotope.UntargettedIsotopesO, respectively. The latter can be
used for proﬁling global label distribution by looking for the isotopes of
all identiﬁed peaks in a PeakML ﬁle; or all compounds in databases such as
the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) (Kanehisa et al.,
2012) or the Human Metabolome Database (HMDB) Mishart et al.,
2009); or using common metabolic transformations recursively, as
described in Breitling et al. (2006), Gipson et al. (2008), Rogers et al.
(2009) and Weber and Viant (2010). All parameters used in these functions
are described at http://mzmatch.sourceforge.net/isotopes-targetted.php.
For both targeted and untargeted analysis, szatch—ISO generates
two outputs—a PDF ﬁle and a tab-delimited ﬁle. The former contains

Fig. 2. Representative example of the output PDF ﬁle generated by
szatch—ISO (see text for details)

one page per metabolite with various plots that describe the pattern of
labelling observed (Fig. 2). The page header shows compound informa-
tion from the target list or the database used for identiﬁcation, and the
ionisation polarity (Fig. 2a). In cases where more than one peakset is
present within a given mass window, each peakset is plotted on a separate
page of the PDF ﬁle (Fig. 2b); usually the correct peakset can be identi-
ﬁed by considering the retention time and intensity proﬁle.
Chromatograms of each unlabelled peak and its corresponding
labelled isotopomers for each sample in each condition are shown
(Fig. 2c), the peak area/height being stored in the accompanying tab-
delimited ﬁle. The intensity and shape of the chromatograms helps to
assess the effect of noisy or incomplete peaks on the reported pattern of
labelling. Furthermore, these chromatograms can be used along with the
plot in Figure 2d, showing the normalized peak area/height of each
mono-isotopic peak and its isotopomers in each replicate, to make in-
formed decisions on outliers by assessing the variability in labelling
between replicates. The overall trend in the labelling pattern of a metab-
olite, as observed between various conditions involved in the study, is also
Visualized (Fig. 2e). This plot is especially useful in tirne—series analyses to
rapidly observe the dynamics of relative concentration changes. The ﬁnal
plot (Fig. 21) not only highlights the labelling trend of an isotopomer of
choice, but, in the case of one-carbon labelling studies, it also compares
observed signals with the theoretical intensity expected based on the nat-
ural abundance of the relevant isotope. This plot is of extreme importance

in studies where natural abundance has to be distinguished from low
levels of labelling.

3 RESULTS

The automated untargeted isotope annotation and relative
quantiﬁcation capabilities of szatch—ISO are demonstrated
by the analysis of LC—MS data from procylic form
T rypanosoma brucei grown on ~50% uniformly 13C-labelled glu-
cose medium for 5 days. The plot in Supplementary Figure S3
generated from the tab-delimited output ﬁle (data are provided
in Supplementary ﬁle S4, and the scripts are available on the
website) highlights the capabilities of szatch—ISO in demon-
strating a complex biological phenomenon.

szatch—ISO provides an efﬁcient and user-friendly output
for the analysis and compact Visualization of isotope-labelled
metabolomics datasets without the need for specialist bioinfor-
matics skills, allowing rapid, precise and meaningful biological
interpretation. The algorithm can be implemented directly in R,
or from the IDEOM graphical user interface, to facilitate follow-
up statistical processing, analyses and re—plotting of the results.

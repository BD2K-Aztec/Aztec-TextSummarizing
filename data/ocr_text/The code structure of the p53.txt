ABSTRACT

Motivation: The tumor-suppressor gene TP53 mutations are diverse
in the central region encoding the DNA-binding domain. It has not
been clear whether the prognostic significance for survival in breast
cancer patients is the same for all types of mutations. Are there spe-
cific types of mutations carrying a worse prognosis? To understand
the correlation between the mutations in the gene encoding the DNA-
binding domain and the prognosis of breast cancer, we studied the
code structure of the DNA-binding domain of breast cancer patients
by using various artificial codes in information transmission.

Results: We indicated that the prognostic significance of all types of
mutations in the DNA-binding domain is not the same, and that the
DNA-binding domain having a certain code structure is important for
estimating the prognosis of breast cancer patients.

1 INTRODUCTION

Breast cancer is the most common cancer among women.
Approximately 1.38 million people around the world are diag-
nosed with breast cancer each year, and ~458 000 people die
from this disease, according to the report of International
Agency for Research on Cancer.

The tumor-suppressor gene TP53 is one of the most frequently
mutated genes in human cancer including breast cancer
(Makwane and Saxena, 2009; Suzuki and Matsubara, 2011;
Takahashi et al., 2000). The protein p53 encoded by the TP53
gene is a DNA sequence-speciﬁc transcription factor involved in
the induction of diverse effects such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis,
repair of DNA lesions, senescence and angiogenesis (Takahashi
et al., 2000; Varna et al., 2011). Mutant p53 not only loses the
wild-type function but also gains new abilities to promote
tumorigenesis (Brosh and Rotter, 2009; Murphy and Rosen,
2000; Suzuki and Matsubara, 2011). Most studies have reported
that mutations in the TP53 gene confer a worse overall survival
and disease-free survival in breast cancer cases, and this effect is
independent of other risk factors (Olivier et al., 2006; Olivier
et al., 2010; Petitjean et al., 2007; Pharoah et al., 1999).
Langerod et al. (2007) have reported that the breast cancer
death rate for patients with TP53 mutations is four to ﬁve
times higher than that for those without mutations. TP53 muta-
tions are mostly missense point mutations and concentrate in the

central region encoding the DNA-binding domain (Kucera et al.,
1999; Suzuki and Matsubara, 2011; Varna et al., 2011). Several
studies have shown that mutations in the DNA-binding domain
including L2 and L3 loops are associated with poor disease-free
and overall survival (Gentile et al., 1999; Lothe et al., 1995;
Young et al., 2007). On the other hand, Powell et al. (2000)
have indicated that the survival of patients with mutations in
the L2/L3 loops is not signiﬁcantly different to the survival of
patients with mutations outside of these domains, and Calefﬁ
et al. (1994) have indicated that there is no signiﬁcant difference
in the overall survival rates between patients with mutant and
wild-type p53 tumors.

There are many patterns for p53 mutations in breast cancer.
Various mutations in the TP53 gene cause single amino acid
changes at many different positions. It is not clear whether the
prognostic signiﬁcance is the same for all types of mutations. Are
there speciﬁc types of mutations carrying a worse prognosis? We
need further work to understand the signiﬁcance concerning the
different mutations in breast cancer prognosis.

In information theory, the concept of information has two
aspects, one of which expresses the amount of complexity of
the whole system such as a sequence itself, and the other con-
cerns the structure of the system such as the rule stored in the
order of sequence (Ingarden et al., 1997).

Concerning the ﬁrst concept of information, according to
Shannon’s philosophy, if a system has larger complexity, then
the system carries larger information, expressed through the
entropy (Ohya and Sato, 2000; Ohya and Volovich, 2011). Here,
the idea of Kolmogorov, the complexity of sequences, might be
used (Chaitin, 1969). Concerning the second concept of informa-
tion, one looks for the structure of sequences (in genome). For this
purpose, coding theory might be useful for the sequence analysis.
The code structure of TP53 gene is studied by applying artiﬁcial
codes in coding theory. The aim of this study is to investigate
whether the gene encoding the DNA-binding domain in breast
cancer case can be characterized by the artiﬁcial codes in infor-
mation transmission, and to understand the correlation between
various mutations in the gene and breast cancer prognosis.

DNA-binding domain, 18 patients had missense point mutations affect-
ing L3 loop (codons 236—251) of DNA-binding domain and 76 patients
had wild-type. We selected patients with at least the following clinical
data: TP53 mutation status affecting L2/L3 loops identiﬁed based on
biopsy or surgery, TNM (tumor, node, metastasis) classiﬁcation and/or
histological stage and relapse-free survival and/or overall survival.

2.2 The code structure of the p53 DNA-binding domain

Because the Galois Field GF(4) consists of four elements, 0, 1, a and a2
such that a2 + a + 1 = 0, the four bases can be expressed in 24 combin-
ations (four bases at each of four elements). We rewrite an important part
of the nucleotide sequence encoding the DNA-binding domain by that of
these four elements, and we make the error-correcting/detecting code by
using an artiﬁcial code. The total length of such a code is multiples of
three, and the length of the information symbols is multiples of two.

1. Remove the third nucleotide of each codon, corresponding to the
check symbol, and transform the remainder (information symbol)
into the elements of the Galois Field.

2. Calculate the check symbols from the information symbols by
means of the code rule.

3. Put the calculated check symbols into the corresponding position
of the third nucleotide of codon.

4. Rewrite the encoded symbol sequence back into the encoded
nucleotide sequence.

Artiﬁcial codes used for our study are linear codes, cyclic codes, Bose-
Chaudhuri—Hocquenghem (BCH) codes, self-orthogonal codes and
Iwadare codes.

Let X be an amino acid sequence. We encoded the nucleotide sequence
using a code C, and then we got the encoded amino acid sequences XC by
the code C. If the code structure of the sequence X is the same as the
structure of the code C, then XC = X. Therefore, we compute the similarity
between X and XC, denoted by rate of coincidence (RC) below, and we
claim that this similarity becomes larger if the code structure of X is closer
to that of C (Ohya and Sato, 2000; Ohya and Volovich, 2011). The degree
RC measuring the similarity between an artiﬁcial code of XC and the
intrinsic code of amino acid sequence X before coding by C is deﬁned by

RC(X,XC)=1—% (0 5 RC(X,XC)51),

where a is the numbers of sites for which two amino acid sequences differ
from each other and t is the total number of sites compared. RC (X, XC) is
close to 0 for poorly related sequences, and RC(X, XC) is close to 1 for

similar sequences. We call RC(X, XC) the rate of coincidence (RC for
short) for the code C. By calculating the RC for various codes, we can
ﬁnd a code structure characterizing the DNA-binding domain. If
RC(X,XC) for a code C is bigger than that of any other codes, then
we can infer that the DNA-binding domain has the property that the
code C owns.

2.3 Survival analysis

The Kaplan—Meier method (Kaplan and Meier, 1958) was used to esti-
mate the relapse-free survival rate and the overall survival rate of breast
cancer patients with stage III or stage IV. The patients were stratiﬁed by
mutation status in the L2 loop, the values of the RC in the L2 loop,
mutation status in the L3 loop and the values of the RC in the L3 loop.
The Wilcoxon test and the log-rank test were used to assess the difference
between survival curves. For the two statistical tests, the P-values <0.05
were considered as statistically signiﬁcant.

3 RESULTS

The Kaplan—Meier plots of breast cancer patients stratiﬁed by
mutation status in the L2 loop are shown in Figure 1A and C.
There was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in the overall

survival between the breast cancer patients with mutation in
the L2 loop and those with wild-type (5-year overall survival:
44.9 versus 84.6%, Fig. 1A). In contrast, there was no signiﬁcant
difference in recurrence-free survival between two cases men-
tioned previously (P: 0.137 for the Wilcoxon test, P: 0.06 for
the log-rank test, Fig. 1C).

The Kaplan—Meier plots of breast cancer patients stratiﬁed by
the RC values in the L2 loop are shown in Figure 1B and D. The
overall survival and recurrence-free survival were statistically
signiﬁcantly worse in patients with the L2 loop that is close to
the (33, 22)-BCH code than patients with the L2 loop that is far
from that code (5-year overall survival: 0 versus 80.3%, Fig. 1B;
5-year recurrence-free survival: 0 versus 41.3%, Fig. 1D). In this
analysis, we made a correspondence between the four bases
and the elements in GF(4) as A—> 0, C—> l, G—> a and
T—> a2. The generator polynomial of the (33, 22)-BCH code
was G(x) = x11 + x10 + x8 + x7 + ax6 + axs + a2x4 + a2x3+
azx + a2.

between the patients with mutation in the L3 loop and those
with wild-type (P=0.0574 for the log-rank test, Fig. 2A;
P=0.277 for the Wilcoxon test, P=0.35 for the log-rank test,

overall survival between the patients with the L3 loop that is
close to the (24, 16)-BCH code and the patients with the L3
loop that is far from that code (5-year overall survival: 82
versus 25%, Fig. 2B). The generator polynomial of the (24,
16)-BCH code was G(x) = x8 + ax6 + ax4 + om2 + or, provided
that the four bases were T—> 0, G—> l, A—> a and C—> a2.

In addition, there was a statistically signiﬁcant difference in
the recurrence-free survival between the patients with the L3 loop
that is close to the (6, 4)-BCH code and the patients with the L3
loop that is far from that code (5-year overall survival: 47.2
versus 25%, Fig. 2D). The generator polynomial of the (6, 4)-
BCH code was G(x) = x2 + 1, provided that the four bases were
G—> 0, A—> 1, T—> a and C—> a2.

4 DISCUSSION

The tumor-suppressor gene TP53 mutations are diverse in the
central region encoding the DNA-binding domain. It has not
been clear whether the prognostic signiﬁcance for survival in
breast cancer patients is the same for all types of mutations.
Are there speciﬁc types of mutations carrying a worse prognosis?
We studied the code structure of the DNA-binding domain of
breast cancer patients by using various artiﬁcial codes in infor-
mation transmission.

In this study, we found a signiﬁcant relation between the code
structure of the DNA-binding domain and the breast cancer
prognosis. Various types of mutations in the DNA-binding
domain were classiﬁed by the code structure. We indicated that
the prognostic signiﬁcance of all types of mutations in the DNA-
binding domain is not the same, and that the DNA-binding
domain having a certain code structure is important for estimat-
ing the prognosis of breast cancer patients. We are convinced
that the classiﬁcation according to the code structure of the
DNA-binding domain is useful for predicting patients who
have a high mortality.

Although novel TP53 mutations are continuously reported,
the biological function is incompletely understood for many
mutant p53 proteins (Berge et al., 2013). Our classiﬁcation may
be also useful for establishing effect of individual mutation on
protein properties such as cell cycle arrest, apoptosis and
senescence.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We describe libSBMLReactionFinder, a C library for
retrieving specific biochemical reactions from the curated systems
biology markup language models contained in the BioModels data-
base. The library leverages semantic annotations in the database to
associate reactions with human-readable descriptions, making the re-
actions retrievable through simple string searches. Our goal is to pro-
vide a useful tool for quantitative modelers who seek to accelerate
modeling efforts through the reuse of previously published represen-
tations of specific chemical reactions.

Availability and implementation: The library is open-source and dual
licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0 and GNU
General Public License Version 2.0. Project source code, downloads
and documentation are available at http://code.google.com/p/

1 OVERVIEW

The BioModels database of systems biology markup language
(SBML) models represents one of the richest collections of reus-
able quantitative chemical network models in existence (Hucka
et al., 2003; Li et al., 2010), and the BioModels Web site has
many features for discovering, exploring and downloading these
models. Together, the several hundred curated models in
BioModels represent thousands of annotated biochemical reac-
tions, and the repository Web site provides tools for investigating
any given model’s individual reactions. However, discovering the
different formulations for one particular kind of reaction (phos-
phofructokinase activity, for example) and extracting an in-
stance for reuse is currently a cumbersome task, requiring
navigation through a number of web pages and direct explor-
ation of model organization. We have developed a C library
called libSBMLReactionFinder (libSBMLRF) to address this
limitation and to provide modelers with the means to program-
matically retrieve and reuse quantitative representations of indi-
vidual chemical reactions found in the BioModels database.
We built the library to simplify access to these reactions and to
promote a more modular approach to chemical network model-
ing by making model components as accessible as the models
themselves.

2 SEARCH AND RETRIEVAL FEATURES

libSBMLRF provides a simple application programming inter-
face (API) for retrieving reactions of interest. Users enter a
phrase into a search function, and the library looks for pattern
matches within a custom knowledge base that represents each
individual reaction in the BioModels database (see Section 3).
After performing a search, the libSBMLRF returns data asso-
ciated with each individual reaction in BioModels that match the
search criteria, including the reaction’s BioModels ID, name, the
minimal information required in the annotation of models
(MIRIAM) identiﬁers it is annotated against and the
BioModels ID of the parent model. Users may limit their
search results to speciﬁc organisms by specifying the scientiﬁc
name of the organism in the search call. For example, a search
for ‘phosphofructokinase’ limited to Saccharomyces cerevisiae
models returns nine results, each representing a speciﬁc reaction
in the BioModels database. Removing the organism limiter on
this search returns 17 reactions.

The library also provides convenience functions for retrieving
the IDs of the reactants, products and modiﬁers in the reaction,
the kinetic law governing the reaction rate and the names and
values of the parameters used in the kinetic law. These methods
rely on functionality provided by the libSBML software library
(Bornstein et al., 2008) for accessing the original representation
of a speciﬁc reaction in its parent SBML model. We include
precompiled binaries of libSBML version 5.8.0 as part of our
library distribution.

3 KNOWLEDGE BASE OF BIOCHEMICAL
REACTIONS

To retrieve individual reactions of interest, libSBMLRF searches
a custom knowledge base, coded in extensible mark-up language,
that stores the semantic classiﬁcation, unique identiﬁers and
source model afﬁliation for each BioModels reaction. At the
time of manuscript preparation, this knowledge base contained
a total of 12335 reactions. When users perform searches, the
library looks for pattern matches in the names of the reactions
in this knowledge base, their IDs and the preferred names and
synonyms of any Gene Ontology, Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes
and Genomes or Enzyme Commission identiﬁers they are anno-
tated against. The library includes a function for generating this
knowledge base anew, ensuring that users can get the most up-
to-date information about BioModels reactions. This function
makes use of libSBML as well as BioModels, UniProt,

Fig. 1. A portion of the extensible mark-up language knowledge base that is automatically created by libSBMLRF and used to retrieve biochemical
reactions of interest. Information for the phosphofructokinase reaction named ‘PFK’ in model BIOMD0000000253 is shown

BioPortal and Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes web
services to collect all the curated SBML models in the repository,
cache them locally, identify all reactions in the models and asso-
ciate the reactions with the human-readable names and synonyms
of the controlled vocabulary terms they are annotated against.
The knowledge base has a simple schema that includes lists of
curated SBML models, biological taxons associated with those
models, individual reactions and controlled vocabulary terms
used to annotate the reactions. Figure 1 illustrates the schema
by showing the representation of the phosphofructokinase reac-
tion from model BIOMD0000000253 (Teusink et al., 1998).

The knowledge base associates reactions with searchable
human-readable descriptions and acts as an index for all reac-
tions in the BioModels corpus. When using the library’s func-
tions to retrieve a speciﬁc reaction’s chemical participants, its
rate law or its rate law parameters, the library looks up the re-
action ID and the ID of its parent model in the knowledge base,
then uses functions provided by libSBML to load the reaction’s
parent SBML model and return the additional information.

4 DISCUSSION AND AVAILABILITY

The functionality of libSBMLRF demonstrates the important
role that semantics play in a modular approach to modeling
(Sauro and Bergmann, 2008). Because the models in the
BioModels repository include rich semantic annotations against
reference ontologies, modelers interested in reusing reactions
from the repository are not required to know the code-level idio-
syncratic identiﬁers of these reactions to discover them. Instead,
they can search for and extract components at a biological,
rather than syntactic, level of conceptualization. With such se-
mantics-based retrieval methods, modelers can build collections
of interoperable model components and apply them in the modu-
lar construction of more complex systems. It is our hope
libSBMLRF will be useful to quantitative modelers who seek
to accelerate their own modeling efforts by using previously pub-
lished representations of speciﬁc chemical reactions.

libSBMLRF is an outgrowth of the SBML Reaction Finder
project (Neal and Sauro, 2012), which is a stand-alone Java-
based application for retrieving and extracting reactions of inter-
est from the BioModels database. Although both projects aim to
give modelers direct, efﬁcient access to individual biochemical
reactions, we created libSBMLRF to make this functionality
available programmatically as a C API. We chose C primarily
because we plan to integrate the library within our J Designer
software and a new software project currently under develop-
ment, both of which are coded in C. libSBMLRF is open-source
and dual licensed under the Mozilla Public License Version 2.0
and GNU General Public License Version 2.0. Source code, pro-
ject downloads and documentation are available at http://code.

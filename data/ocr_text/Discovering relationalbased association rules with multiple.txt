ABSTRACT

Motivation: Association rule analysis methods are important
techniques applied to gene expression data for finding expression
relationships between genes. However, previous methods implicitly
assume that all genes have similar importance, or they ignore the
individual importance of each gene. The relation intensity between
any two items has never been taken into consideration. Therefore, we
proposed a technique named REMMAR (REIational-based Multiple
Minimum supports Association Rules) algorithm to tackle this
problem. This method adjusts the minimum relation support (MRS)
for each gene pair depending on the regulatory relation intensity to
discover more important association rules with stronger biological
meaning.

Results: In the actual case study of this research, REM/WAR utilized
the shortest distance between any two genes in the Saccharomyces
cerevisiae gene regulatory network (GRN) as the relation intensity to
discover the association rules from two S.cerevisiae gene expression
datasets. Under experimental evaluation, REM/WAR can generate
more rules with stronger relation intensity, and filter out rules without
biological meaning in the protein—protein interaction network (PPIN).
Furthermore, the proposed method has a higher precision (100%)
than the precision of reference Apriori method (87.5%) for the
discovered rules use a literature survey. Therefore, the proposed
REM/WAR algorithm can discover stronger association rules in
biological relationships dissimilated by traditional methods to assist
biologists in complicated genetic exploration.

1 INTRODUCTION

Formerly, biologists were constrained to performing laboratory
experiments to clarify gene expressions; however, manipulation of
multiple genes is very costly, in both time and money. Microarray
technology is a useful tool for gaining the expression value of
many genes in the cell environment while simultaneously tackling

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

the manipulation problem. At present, how to explain the cell’s
inner working with efﬁciency has become another challenge for
the biologist. Data mining technologies are ideal for discovering
information from large datasets. Thus, a growing number of
researchers are applying data mining technologies for efﬁcient
elucidation of genetic information.

Recently, various types of analysis methods were proposed to
analyze gene expression data, such as clustering analysis (Cheng
and Church, 2000; Jiang et al., 2004; Madeira and Oliveira,
2004; Pei et al., 2003; Prelic et al., 2006; Thalamuthu et al.,
2006), association rule analysis (Creighton and Hanash, 2003;
Georgii et al., 2005; Martinez et al., 2008; McIntosh and Chawla,
2007), classiﬁcation analysis (Bhasin and Raghava, 2004; Liu and
Xu, 2009; Martella, 2009), among others. These methods equip
biologists to extract biological knowledge quickly for different
analysis purposes. Association rule analysis is used to ﬁnd and
describe relationships between genes. Every rule indicates whether a
given gene is expressed (T) or repressed (I) to describe expression
relationships in a cellular environment. Suppose that we discover
the rule {gene xT} => {gene yl, gene z T} from a gene expression
dataset. This rule states that when gene x is expressed, gene y is
repressed and gene z is expressed together in this dataset. Two
important thresholds exist to measure the signiﬁcance of a rule,
support and conﬁdence. The support of a rule is the frequency that
gene x T, gene y I and gene z T together in a sample. The conﬁdence
of a rule is the frequency that gene y I, gene z T occurs when gene x T
occurs (Creighton and Hanash, 2003).

Although various types of association rule analysis methods were
proposed to analyze gene expression data (Creighton and Hanash,
2003; Georgii et al., 2005; Martinez et al., 2008; McIntosh and
Chawla, 2007), not all of the proposed methods ﬁt with the goal
of our work in exploring the regulatory relations of genes from
microarray datasets. Georgii et al. (2005) adopted the half—space
technique to discover quantitative association rules on numeric
microarray datasets without requiring a discretization process.
However, their approach cannot mine a complete set of relevant rules
when applying the method on microarray proﬁle. Martinez et al.
(2008) proposed the GenMiner method to mine association rules
from a set of gene expression proﬁles and the publicly available
gene ontology (GO) terms. However, the main purpose of their
approach is different from ours since they were in an attempt to
extract relationships between certain genes and its annotated GO
terms. Finally, McIntosh and Chawla (2007) proposed an association
rule mining algorithm called MaxConf, which was developed with a
row—enumeration method. However, it did not consider the constraint

of minimum support threshold. Moreover, the results of applying
the algorithm on microarray dataset can only show high conﬁdence
gene regulations. Nevertheless, MaxConf may fail in discovering
the longer rules with the context containing many items. However,
the longer rules are usually more important than the rules that are
shorter in size in the real applications (Alves et al., 2010). On the
other hand, the rules with low support would also be mined using
their algorithm. These rules are likely to be regarded as false positive
as long as they appear infrequently over all samples. Differentiated
with the previous works as described above, our method proposed
in this article is effective for mining putative gene regulations from
microarray proﬁles.

However, the traditional association rule analysis implicitly
assumes that all items have similar importance without considering
their signiﬁcance in the data. Regardless, this is often not the case
in real—life applications. Therefore, a number of researchers have
proposed weight—based (Cai et al., 1998; Ramkumar et al., 1998;
Tao et al., 2003; Tseng et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2000; Yun and
Legged,2005)cmrnuhqﬂesuppondxmed(Ln1etal,1999;Suetal,
2008) association rule mining to engage this problem in a transaction
database. Nevertheless, traditionally weighted or multiple support—
based association rule mining techniques only take into account
the importance of each item. In a number of real—life case, the
degree of importance is dependent on relationships between items.
Both techniques never consider the relation intensity between any
two items. For this reason, we propose the REMMAR (RElational-
based Multiple Minimum supports Association Rules) algorithm,
which adjusts the minimum relation support (MRS) for each paired
item dependent on the relation intensity, to discover the rules that
have stronger biological meaning. In a real case study, we used
the shortest distance between any two genes in the gene regulatory
network (GRN) as the relation importance. Two real S. cerevisiae
microarray datasets were used to evaluate the comparison results
between the traditional association rule mining method and the
proposed algorithm.

The remainder of this article is organized as follows: Section 2
provides a brief review of traditional association rule mining and
presents the proposed method; Section 3 consists of the application
of the approach to S. cerevisiae datasets, to study the signiﬁcance of

2 METHODS

In this section, we ﬁrst describe the reference Apriori algorithm and research
using the Apriori framework to discover gene interaction rules from gene
expression data. Before we utilize the REMMAR algorithm to discover
association rules, microarray data must undergo a transformation into
transactional data format. Thereafter, the problem in the research must be
deﬁned. Finally, Section 2.3 shows the proposed REMMAR algorithm in
detail.

2.1 Traditional association rule mining

Agrawal et al. (1993, 1994) ﬁrst proposed association rule analysis. It was
used as the Apriori algorithm (Agrawal et al., 1993; Agrawal and Srikant,
1994) to analyze databases, to discover valuable relationships between items.
The support of an itemset is deﬁned as the frequency that occurs in all
transactions. If the support of an itemset was not less than the user—speciﬁed
minimum support, it would be recognized as a large itemset (frequent
itemset), because strong relationships exist between items in this itemset.

format.

The main concept of all Apriori—based methods is that any subitemsets of
a large itemset is surely also a large itemset. In other words, an itemset is
not required to be revised if it exceeds minimum support as long as any
one of subitemsets of the itemset is not a large itemset. For example, if a
large itemset generated by an Apriori—based algorithm contains k items, all
of the subitemsets involving 1 to k —1 items are certainly large itemsets. In
contrast, with a brute force method, an itemset needs to be veriﬁed even if
it contains an item whose frequency does not exceed the minimum support.
Taken together, using an Apriori—based method can reduce the overhead in
examining whether the produced itemsets are large ones. For this reason, the
Apriori—based methods are more efﬁcient since the veriﬁcation of ineligible
itemsets is not required. When all large itemsets are identiﬁed, any large
itemset possessing more than one item can be divided into two itemsets, SC
and Sy. An association rule is described as 8;, => Sy, where 8;, and Sy are
the left—hand side (LHS) and right—hand side (RHS) of this rule, respectively.
This rule means that Sy can possibly occur where S, exists. The conﬁdence
of a candidate rule is the frequency that Sy occurs when S, exists. If the
conﬁdence of this candidate rule is not less than a user—speciﬁed minimum
conﬁdence, it would be deﬁned as an association rule in this data.

In 2003, Creighton and Hanash (2003) used the Apriori method to discover
numerous gene interaction rules from gene expression data, many of which
are biologically sensible. Every rule can indicate whether a given gene is
expressed (T) or repressed (l), to describe the expression relationship in a
cellular environment. Suppose that the user discovers the rule {gene x T} =>
{gene y l, gene z T} from the gene expression dataset. This rule states that if
gene x is expressed, then gene y is repressed and gene z is expressed together
in this dataset.

2.2 Gene expression data transformation and basic
deﬁnitions of our method

2.2.] Transformation of gene expression data As with the model
Creighton and Hanash (2003) proposed, which consists of applying the
association—based method on gene expression data analysis, each sample
can be recognized as a transaction. Each expression value in the data can be
transformed as up (T; expressed; readings are > 0.2 for the log base 10 of fold
change 1.58 as upper bound), down (i; repressed; readings are lower than
—0.2 for the log base 10 of fold change —1.58 as lower bound) or normal
(neither expressed nor repressed). For the threshold value of :I:0.2, it is set in
a reasonable range (fold change from 1.5 to 2.0) based on most microarray
analysis studies in identifying the differentially expressed probes. The up or
down notation sufﬁces in displaying whether a gene is signiﬁcant and has
the probability to inﬂuence other genes. For this reason, only the expression
value for each gene can be transformed as up or down in transactional data
format, as shown in Figure 1. After gene expression data transformation,
gene x T and gene x i will be deﬁned in different items. Thus, the number
of items would be increased when either decreasing the upper bound or
increasing lower bound, whereas that of items would be decreased when
either increasing upper bound or decreasing lower bound.

2.2.2 Initial minimum support The support of an itemset SC is the
frequency of S, occurrence in all transactions (Samples). The initial minimum
support (IMS) is a user—speciﬁed baseline threshold to judge the support of
each item. Items greater than, or equal to, IMS are called large 1-itemsets.

2.2.3 Initial minimum conﬁdence The conﬁdence of an association rule
Sx=> Sy is the frequency of Sy occurrence when 8;, occurs. The initial
minimum conﬁdence (IMC) is a user—speciﬁed baseline threshold to judge
the conﬁdence of each rule.

2.2.4 Minimum relation support In the real case study of this research,
we used the shortest distance between any two genes in the GRN as the
relational importance. As an example, Figure 2 is a GRN. For any pair
of neighboring genes (physical interaction) in the network, the distance
between them will be deﬁned as 1. Hence, the shortest distance between
G2 and G4 is 1, and that between G1 and G2 is 3. In theory, two genes
are more likely to involve the same pathways or biological functions if
they have a shorter distance. Figure 3 is the gene shortest distance matrix
retrieved from the GRN of Figure 2. The maximum shortest distance
(Max_Dist), minimum shortest distance (Min_Dist) and average shortest
distance (Avg_Dist) of this matrix are 3, 1 and 1.7, respectively. Suppose the
user—speciﬁed IMS is 20%, and the shortest distance between G2 and G4 is 1
[Dist(G2T,G4T)=Dist(G2T,G4l)=Dist(G2l,G4T)=Dist(G2l,G4l)=1].
Depending on Equation (1), G2 and G4 can get the MRS to 17.55%
[MRS(G2T,G4T)=MRS(G2T,G4l)=MRS(G2l,G4T)=MRS(G2l,G4l)
217.55%], because G2 and G4 have a stronger relation intensity (with
smaller shortest distance) than others in the GRN. Furthermore, if the
itemset S has more than two items, based on the second equation, the MRS
of S will be the maximum MRS of each item—pair in S. A large itemset
would be generated as long as the support value of the itemset (contains at
least two items) is not less than its corresponding MRS.

MRS(w) = . . ( 1)
IMS — (IMS* ( W )2) Otherwise
MRS(S) = Max{MRS(x, y)|x, y e S and x 75y, where S is an itemset (2)

containing more than one item}

2.2.5 Minimum relation conﬁdence As Creighton and Hanash (2003)
proposed, this study focused on the rule Sx=> Sy, where S, has a single
item, as to limit the search space of candidate rules. In the Minimum relation
conﬁdence (MRC), we also used the shortest distance between any two
genes in the GRN as the relation importance. Based on Equations (3)

and (4), the MRC of rule Sx=> Sy will be the maximum MRC of each
item—pair between S, and Sy. Suppose the user—speciﬁed IMC is 45% and
the MRC({G2T}=> {G4T, G5l})=Max{MRC(G2T, G4T), MRC(G2T,
G5l)} =Max{39.4875, 46.0125} 2 46.0125. Therefore, in this example, if
the conﬁdence value of the rule ({G2T} => {G4T, G5l }) is not less than its
corresponding MRC (46.0125), the rule would be an eligible association rule.

MRC(Sx => Sy) = Max{MRC(x, y)|x e Sx andy e Sy, where Sx and Sy areitemsets} (3)

2.3 Relational-based multiple minimum supports
association rules mining

The REMMAR algorithm was proposed to discover gene interaction rules
from the gene expression database on relation intensity. As stated above in
Section 2.1, REMMAR utilizes the main concept of Apriori to improve the
efﬁciency of mining association rules compared with the brute force method.
The REMMAR algorithm is shown below:

1. for(k=1;Lk_1 7E¢;k+-l-) do
2. if (k: 1) then

3. for all transactions t in database D do
4. L1={c in C1|c.count>=c.IMS}
5. end

6. else

7. C k =candidate-gen(Lk_ 1)

8. for all transactions t in D do

9. Ct=subset(Ck, t)

10. for all candidates 0 in C, do

12. end

13. end

14. end

15. Lk={c in Cklc.count>=c.MRS}
16. end

17. AnswerzUkLk
The main process of the REMMAR algorithm is described as follows:

(1) Count the support of each item in Database D (all samples). If the
support of the item is greater than, or equal to, the IMS, it is called
large 1—itemsets in L1 (the set that includes all the large 1-itemsets).

(2) Utilize the candidate-gen function to generate candidate k-itemsets in
Ck (the set that includes all the candidate k-itemsets) based on large
k—l-itemsets in Lk_1.

(3) Utilize the subset function to count the support of each candidate
k-itemset in D.

(4) If the support of the candidate k-itemset in Ck is greater than, or equal
to, the MRS of this itemset, it is called large k-itemsets in Lk.

(5) Increment k by 1 and repeat the procedure from Stage 2 to Stage 4
until candidate itemsets can no longer be generated.

After the process of REMMAR, the algorithm can generate all large
itemsets that satisfy the MRS. In the next phase, for each set of large itemset
L and each possible subset A of L, they can generate the association rule
A —> (L—A) that satisﬁes the MRC themselves.

Following the proposal of Agrawal et al. (1994), REMMAR have two
important functions similar to other Apriori—based algorithms; the candidate-
gen function and the subset function. The candidate-gen function is used to
generate the candidate k-itemsets in Ck based on the large k— litemsets in
Lk_1.

The subset function will utilize the candidate itemsets generated from the

If the candidate itemsets from Ck are the subset of a transaction t, it will be
deﬁned as C, (candidate itemsets in transaction t). The support of itemsets
from C, will then be incremented by 1. Each transaction t will be scanned
once to measure the support of Ck dependent on the Subset function when
each level of Ck has been generated.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSIONS

This section compares the association rules discovered from the
proposed REMMAR algorithm to the reference Apriori method,
and whether the former is superior at satisfying the biological
meaning. The ﬁrst part presents a brief introduction of the gene
regulatory (GR) data, the protein—protein interaction (PPI) data and
two yeast—related datasets that were utilized. The second part offers
a comparison of the signiﬁcance of rules REMMAR discovered,
against of reference Apriori method, to verify with the PPI network.
The third part displays the discovered rules that are veriﬁed with
biological literatures.

3.1 Datasets

The GR and PPI data of S.cerevisiae were obtained from the
Saccharomyces Genome Database (Cherry et al., 1998). The GRN
is composed of 5331 genes interacting with one another via
143 668 transcriptional regulation interactions. The protein—protein
interaction network (PPIN) comprises 5603 proteins interacting with
one another via 85 622 protein physical interactions.

To the best of our knowledge, the microarray proﬁle can be
conducted in the three major experiments involving temporal,
duplicate and perturbation (McIntosh and Chawla, 2007). In this
study, we applied our proposed method on two microarrays
involving individual datasets performed by Gasch et al. (2000) and
Brem et al. (2002). The former is a S.cerevisiae gene expression
dataset on different stress in perturbation experiment, which contains
a collection of 173 different stress conditions and a selection of
2993 genes. The latter is a S.cerevisiae gene expression dataset
in duplicate on yeast segregation experiment. The dataset contains
6229 genes and 40 segregates with dye swap are included.

3.2 Evaluation with PPIN

In the real case study, the shortest distance between any two genes in
the GRN was used as the relation importance to discover association
rules. The distances of proteins that have physical interactions are
deﬁned as 1 in PPIN. Moreover, the average shortest distance (ASD)
between any two proteins is 2.771 in PPIN. This section shows
that the rules discovered with REMMAR have stronger biological

meanings (has the shorter ASD in the PPIN) than those discovered
with the reference Apriori algorithm. The focus on rules was on
position where the LHS possesses only a single item, as Creighton
and Hanash (2003) proposed, to limit the search space of candidate
rules in this study. Therefore, if the rules represent their items with
{gene xT} => {gene y l,gene zT}, the rule length (RL) is deﬁned
as 3 (RL3). In addition, if the shortest distance between gene x and
gene y in PPIN is 2, then the shortest distance between gene x and
gene z in PPIN is 4. Based on Equation (5), the ASD of this rule in
PPIN is 3.

We conducted a novel method named REMMAR, which
automatically adjusted two arguments involving [M C and IMS. To
prove that our improvement is signiﬁcant, we set [M C of our method
as 80%, which is same as the minimum conﬁdence value introduced
in the primitive Apriori algorithm of a previous approach (Creighton
and Hanash, 2003). On the other hand, we empirically set the values
of [MS and minimum support since the aim of this research is to
manually evaluate the mined rules by either REMMAR or Apriori
with literature. By decreasing the values (lower threasholds) of [MS
for REMMAR and minimum support for Apriori, a large number
of satisﬁed rules will be mined. This arises a big problem that
comprehensive evaluations of these massive rules would be beyond
our ability. On the contrary, few rules will be mined when we
increased the parameter values (higher threasholds). In facing this
trade—off, in this study, we set both the IMS value for REMMAR and
the minimum support value for Apriori as 60% in the ﬁrst dataset
(Gasch et al., 2000) and 92% in the second dataset (Brem et al.,
2002).

Table 1 indicates the resultant rule numbers under different
methods (Apriori and REMMAR) and different RLs in the ﬁrst
dataset. Here ‘Common’ represents the intersection of the results
produced by Apriori and REMMAR algorithms. ‘Apriori (no
common)’ and ‘REMMAR (no common)’ represent the respective
results without the common intersection. In other words, all rules
within the respective results are unique. From RL2 to RL7, both
Apriori and REMMAR generated 42 739 (including common) and
53 616 (including common) rules, respectively. In all, 37 771 of the
discovered rules appear in both generated rule sets. From RL2 to
RL7, only a difference of 4968 and 15 845 rules exists. Furthermore,
Table 2 indicates the ASD under different methods and different
RLs in the ﬁrst dataset. In this table, REMMAR (no common)
can discover shorter ASD rules in PPIN under any RL in contrast
with Apriori (no common). The ASD (2.173) of a total number of
association rules mined by REMMAR (no common) is better than

that (2.288) of the Apriori (no common). Therefore, in the result of
this dataset, REMMAR can evidently mine not only more rules, but
also rules of more importance in real biological signiﬁcance than
traditional association rule mining methods.

Table 3 indicates the result rule numbers under different
methods (Apriori and REMMAR) and different RLs in the second
dataset. From RL2 to RL14, Apriori and REMMAR generated
613 799 (including common) and 541 165 (including common)
rules, respectively. However, 541 133 rules are shared in both
generated rule sets. Hence, from RL2 to RL14, only 72 666 and
32 rules are different. Moreover, Table 4 indicates the ASD under
different methods and different RLs in the second dataset. In this
table, REMMAR (no common) can discover shorter ASD rules in
PPIN under any RL than Apriori (no common). The ASD (2.467) of a
total number of association rules mined by REMMAR (no common)
is better than that (2.873) of the Apriori (no common). The ASD
2.873 of Apriori (no common) is inferior to the ASD 2.771 between
any two proteins in PPIN. Therefore, in the result of this dataset,
REMMAR was evidently not generating many rules that have no
real biological meanings.

3.3 Evaluation with literature

After evaluating the correlation of associated rules with ASD in
PPIN, REMMAR, proposed in this study, has a lower ASD compared
with the Apriori method. Genes involved in association rules have
a high probability for representing an interaction at protein level,
which includes three main types: positive regulation, negative
regulation or physical interaction. However, the PPIN does not
contain this information. This study applied REMMAR on two yeast—
related datasets, composed of differentially expressed values of

Table 2. Average shortest distance of rules in PPIN under different methods
and RL in the ﬁrst dataset

 

RL2 RL3 RL4 RL5 RL6 RL7 Total

probes. Upregulation and downregulation of a gene in different
conditions are represented as two items within a transaction database
(see Section 2).

Both Apriori and REMMAR algorithms generated numerous rules
from these two datasets, as shown in Tables 1 and 3. Verifying
all these rules with literature is a difﬁcult task. Therefore, if our
identiﬁed rules have physical interactions in PPIN (ASD=1), the
rules whose regulations involve positive or negative regulations
would be further veriﬁed with the literature. We showed the
results in Table 5. In this table, we want to test whether these
association rules are highly informative, especially in the biological
domain. In previous studies, an increasing amount of literature has
reported enormous critical regulations for gene pairs in certain
conditions. These published papers were manually collected as
ground truth for validating rules identiﬁed from these two datasets.
In the Supplementary Material, the rules in each dataset in the
beginning will be disassembled into a length of two as relations
for verifying with the literature. For example, {YLL039C_Up}
=> {YDR074W_Up, YHR089C_Down} will be disassembled into
{YLL039C_Up} => {YDR074W_Up} and {YLL039C_Up} =>
{YHR089C_Down} two disassembled relations. If prior studies
have reported a disassembled relation, a positive serial number of
corresponding papers will be assigned in its entry in the References
column. On the contrary, the serial numbers in negative represent an
opposite way between the relations and the statement of literature.
For instance, for the ﬁrst dataset results, we illustrate two relations:
{YJL164C_Up} => {YPL203W_Up} and {YPL203W_Up} =>
{YJL164C_Up}. The former states that the overexpressed gene
YPL203W is dependent on the upregulation of gene YJL164C, and

REMMAR

 

vice versa for the latter. In terms of this bidirectional regulation,
these two genes may have a high cooperation or a similar function
in a bioprocess. Interestingly, Toda et al. (1987) had identiﬁed
that these two candidates can encode catalytic subunits of cAMP—
dependent protein kinases, and be encoded by the TPK genes in
1987. A similar result showed that these two genes play critical
roles for the maintenance of iron levels (Robertson et al., 2000).
For biologists, the most important issue is how these relations
provide valuable information. The REMMAR method identiﬁed
a novel relation between a pair of genes; {YCR057C_Down}
=> {YGL171W_Down}. To date, the relation has not been
reported. To check the reliability of the novel regulation relation
‘{YCR057C_Down} => {YGL171W_Down}’ discovered in this
study, we get insights into the biological functions of these
two genes through a literature survey. Both proteins, YCR057C
and YGL171W, have been reported in the assembly of the 908
preribosomal particle to drive the process of ribosome biosynthesis
(Dosil and Bustelo, 2004; Grandi et al., 2002). Moreover, it has
also been reported that they played functional roles involved in
rRNA biogenesis in the nucleolus (Dragon et al., 2002; Venema
and Tollervey, 1999). However, to the best of our knowledge, it
has yet been reported that both proteins directly regulate each
other even though they would colocalize with ribosomes and
nucleolus. Therefore, we can provide biologists with this kind of
gene regulation relation with high reliance in validation. Moreover,
it has been reported that YCR057C could predominantly accumulate
in a complex with YJL069C (Dosil and Bustelo, 2004). This
relation can also be found in our results. Hence, this study
provides a novel relation for gene pairs among a total number
of 34 disassembled relations. All remaining relations in the two
datasets coincided with previous studies in certain conditions
of yeast species. Therefore, when comparing to the reference
algorithm in this study, the advantages of applying REMMAR to
automatically adjust MRS yield a precision of 100% (3 3/33, without
considering the novel one), rather than Apriori’s 87.5% (7/8). We
can ﬁnd an incorrect disassembled relation, {YPL154C_Up} =>
{YMR174C_Up}, which does not correspond to the contents of
previous literature because Pai3p (YMR174C) was reported as a
speciﬁc Pep4p (YPL154C) inhibitor (Phylip et al., 2001). However,
since a pair of genes with long distance may involve in different
pathways or play entirely different roles in a cell, we only veriﬁed
the part of both methods that identiﬁed distinctive rules, whose
ASD values are equal to 1 in PPIN. If the ASD of an identiﬁed
rule is >1, this rule would not be considered for veriﬁcation in this
study. Deﬁnitely, there exist putative gene regulations that have yet
been identiﬁed. Besides, all the rules and disassembled relations
evaluated with literature are unique, as shown in the Supplementary
Material. In fact, we found 33 veriﬁed disassembled relations that
did not appear in the results by the reference Apriori algorithm.
The results of this study suggest that the REMMAR method has a
signiﬁcant improvement, which can identify more association genes
from microarray data.

4 CONCLUSION

In this study, we proposed the REMMAR algorithm to tackle the
inefﬁciency of previous methods, which never took into account
the importance of each item. Moreover, for discovering more
meaningful rules in biology, the proposed REMMAR would adjust

the MRS for each individual gene pair according to the intensities
of two neighboring genes in the PPIN. Not only did we improve the
traditional association algorithm with a multiple support mechanism
called REMMAR, but it was also applied on two yeast datasets
for mining association genes in different conditions. The shortest
distance between any two genes in the GRN was used as the relation
importance in this study. In the ﬁrst part of the result evaluation,
the proposed method not only generated more rules with stronger
relation intensity, but also ﬁltered rules without biological meaning
in the PPIN. In the second part of the evaluation, the part of
the discovered rules was veriﬁed with biological literature. The
proposed method has a precision of 100%, whereas the reference
Apriori method exhibits a precision of 87.5%. Therefore, the
proposed method is more effective in helping biologists explore the
relationships of biological activities.

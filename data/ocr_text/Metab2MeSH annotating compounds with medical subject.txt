ABSTRACT

Summary: Progress in high-throughput genomic technologies
has led to the development of a variety of resources that
link genes to functional information contained in the biomedical
literature. However, tools attempting to link small molecules to
normal and diseased physiology and published data relevant
to biologists and clinical investigators, are still lacking. With
metabolomics rapidly emerging as a new omics field, the task of
annotating small molecule metabolites becomes highly relevant.
Our tool Metab2MeSH uses a statistical approach to reliably and
automatically annotate compounds with concepts defined in Medical
Subject Headings, and the National Library of Medicine’s controlled
vocabulary for biomedical concepts. These annotations provide links
from compounds to biomedical literature and complement existing
resources such as PubChem and the Human Metabolome Database.

1 INTRODUCTION

In recent years, many tools have been developed for automated
annotation of genes, transcripts and proteins and linking them
to published biomedical literature. The resulting information has
proved valuable for a range of bioinformatics tools and research
related to disease gene prioritization, gene set enrichment testing,
and pathway Visualization tools (Bresell et al., 2006; Gaulton et al.,
2007; Leach et al., 2009; Sartor et al., 2010; Soldatos et al., 2010).
Vast amounts of data describing biological roles of metabolites,
drugs and other small molecules have been published. Several
public databases have been developed to annotate the metabolome of
human and other organisms (J ewison et al., 2012; Mochamad Afendi
et al., 2012; Wishart et al., 2009). However, to date there are still
few tools that attempt to automatically develop, search and present
literature—derived compound annotations to the biomedical research
community. PubChem is a public resource, used by individual

researchers and as input data for other tools, that provides access
to 30 million compounds and 85 million substances, and includes
biomedical, structure, safety and additional information, including
links to Pubmed abstracts Via synonym mapping (Wang et al.,
2009). ToxNet is another tool, developed by National Library of
Medicine (NLM), that allows searches for compounds, and provides
links to relevant literature through multiple sources (Wexler, 2001).
Several tools geared towards chemists such as Compounds In
Literature (CIL) and WENDI, allow users to search compounds
using names, smiles strings or compound structures and identify
relevant publications (Gruning et al., 2011; Zhu et al., 2010).

Rather than linking compounds to all available literature, we
decided to utilize Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) to annotate
compounds with the most commonly associated medical/biological
terms and Vice versa. We believe that this approach helps to provide
more focused results and aids in ﬁnding relevant relationships and
literature. MeSH is the NLM controlled vocabulary used to manually
index articles for MEDLINE/PubMed. MeSH covers a broad range
of biological topics and medical terms, with such general headings
as Disease, Anatomy, Chemicals and Drugs, and Phenomena and
Processes. There are currently 26142 MeSH descriptors that are
organized into a hierarchical structure. In addition, there are 83
MeSH qualiﬁers that can be used to narrow a descriptor to a more
speciﬁc topic.

NLM provides a list of chemical substances that contain a
wide range of synonyms used in biomedical publications that
can be linked to the compound synonyms used in PubChem.
Using the compounds and their occurrences in PubMed literature,
we performed statistical tests to estimate the signiﬁcance of
the associations between compound—MeSH descriptor pairs. The
resulting associations, supporting data and literature can be accessed
through our web—based tool, Metab2MeSH. Web services are
also available (http://ws.ncibi.org/m2m.html) and allow for batch
queries. Users have the ability to identify either the MeSH
descriptors signiﬁcantly associated with a given compound or the
compounds associated with a selected MeSH descriptor. Examples
of both use cases are provided below.

The PubChem Compound and Substance databases and NLM PubMed
database were downloaded, parsed and loaded into a relational database.

are accessible in the web application.

PubMed abstract. The process used to create Metab2Mesh is outlined in
Figure 1. The PubChem Substance database contains a list of user—supplied
synonyms for each compound. We used those to identify matching synonyms
in our list of PubMed Substances. This provided the links between PubChem
compounds and literature citations. A total of 81 028 PubChem compounds
were linked to literature citations. Links between MeSH descriptors and
literature citations are provided directly by PubMed. To avoid irrelevant
information in our Metab2MeSH tool, we ﬁltered the MeSH descriptors to
those under the following main headings: Diseases, Anatomy, Chemicals and
Drugs, Phenomena and Processes, Organisms, Psychiatry and Psychology,
Anthropology, Education, Sociology and Social Phenomena, Technology,
Industry, and Agriculture. This resulted in a total of 21 818 unique MeSH
descriptors. Next, we determined the total number of PubMed articles
annotated with at least one of these MeSH descriptors and at least one
PubMed substance that maps to a PubChem synonym (6 million), which
served as the complete background set of articles for our tests. We also
determined the PubMed articles annotated with each MeSH descriptor
and each PubMed substance, and the total number of articles for each
compound.

Using these values and the numbers of PubMed articles co—annotated with
each compound—MeSH term pair, we tested the signiﬁcance of association
between each compound—MeSH term pair using two—sided Fisher’s exact
tests, and p—values were calculated. This resulted in a total of 42 million
tests, with 4 646 000 signiﬁcant associations (p—value < 0.0001). Signiﬁcant
associations are presented in Metab2MeSH sorted by p—value. The False
Discovery Rate method was used to adjust p—values for multiple comparisons,
and the resulting q—values are provided (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).
(In certain instances, the association is so signiﬁcant that the precise p—value
cannot be calculated. In these cases, the p—value is set to 0 and the X2 statistic
from the equivalent xz—test is used to sort the associations by decreasing
signiﬁcance.) As an alternative measure of strength of association, we provide
the Fold Change, deﬁned for a speciﬁc compound and MeSH descriptor as
follows:

Fold Change = (P/C)/(d/t),

where p is the number of articles that have the compound and MeSH
descriptor pair, 0 is the total number of articles that contain the compound,

d is the total number of articles that contain the MESH descriptor and t is
the total number of articles considered. We combined the above signiﬁcant
results with links to the literature and PubChem compounds in a web interface
to create our tool, Metab2MeSH (http://metab2mesh.ncibi.org). The data are
updated twice a year. Supplementary Materials and Supplementary Figure
Sl contain further details about the web interface.

The Metab2MeSH data set can also be accessed through our web
services (http://ws.nCibi.org/m2m.html) which allows users to query the
Metab2MeSH database programmatically, and perform batch queries if
desired. The resulting computer—parsable XML data include compound—
MeSH term pairs with signiﬁcance values and a list of associated PMIDs
(see Supplementary Material for an example web services bulk query).

3 RESULTS

To illustrate the uses and features of Metab2MeSH, we present
two applications. Suppose we would like to determine whether
cyclic AMP (CAMP) is commonly associated with any certain
type of cancer. We can query the compound ‘cyclic AMP’ in
Metab2MeSH using an exact match search and ﬁlter the MeSH
headings by Disease to see that 29 diseases are found to be
signiﬁcantly associated with CAMP among the top 1000 displayed.
To see the complete list of results (>1000), we can download the
tab—delimited text ﬁle to view in a spreadsheet. Supplementary
Figure S2 shows the Metab2MeSH results for the top diseases.
The two diseases most strongly associated with CAMP levels are
pseudohypoparathyroidism and neuroblastoma. There are several
other types of cancers listed, but neuroblastomas are by far the most
strongly associated MeSH Disease term by p—value (p: 3.7e—262).
‘Leydig cell tumor’, although less studied in the literature, had the
highest fold enrichment (fold = 12.5), with other cancers including
Glioma, Osteosarcoma and Adrenal Gland Neoplasms. Clicking the
literature link for Neuroblastoma and limiting to Review artiCles
immediately brings our attention to ‘Defects in CAMP—pathway
may initiate carcinogenesis in dividing nerve cells’ (Prasad et al.,
2003).

Another important feature of Metab2MeSH is the ability to
searCh for compounds associated with a MeSH descriptor, e.g. a
disease. Suppose one would like to identify compounds associated
with phenylketonuria, a metabolic disease caused by a defect in
the enzyme phenylalanine hydroxylase. This enzyme is required
to convert phenylalanine to tyrosine. Supplementary Figure S3
shows the top 25 compounds associated with Phenylketonurias.
Among these are phenylalanine, endophenyl, tetrahydrobiopterin,
sapropterin, pterin and several other compounds that are known
to be associated with this disease. This example illustrates that
Metab2MeSH prioritizes known relationships. If users are unsure
of the MeSH term they require, they can browse the MeSH tree
via our provided link. Metab2MeSH also provides a quiCk way to
retrieve the abstracts related to both disease and the compound. No
other tool currently has this capability. Additional examples of use
are provided in the Supplementary Material.

In conclusion, Metab2MeSH provides a quiCk and convenient
method for identifying compounds commonly associated with a
biological topiC or medical term, or for identifying biological topics
or medical terms commonly associated with a compound of interest.
Although Metab2MeSH is not meant to predict novel associations
(due to its dependence on what is in the literature), as the examples
illustrate, it is very useful for identifying sets of associations that
would otherwise be difﬁcult to ﬁnd. Metab2MeSH creates a valuable

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The plethora of information that emerges from large-
scale genome characterization studies has triggered the development
of computational frameworks and tools for efficient analysis, interpret-
ation and visualization of genomic data. Functional annotation of gen-
omic variations and the ability to visualize the data in the context of
whole genome and/or multiple genomes has remained a challenging
task. We have developed an interactive web-based tool, AVIA
(Annotation, Visualization and Impact Analysis), to explore and inter-
pret large sets of genomic variations (single nucleotide variations and
insertion/deletions) and to help guide and summarize genomic experi-
ments. The annotation, summary plots and tables are packaged and
can be downloaded by the user from the email link provided.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the advances of next-generation sequencing technology,
many laboratories and research groups generate huge amounts
of sequencing data and face common challenges of identification,
managing and interpretation of genomic variations. Recent sur-
veys (Gnad et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2013; Pabinger et al., 2013) of
software tools supporting basic computational steps of variation
analysis present a comprehensive picture of the different options
for analysis and help to identify the best practices in the field.
The variety of the variation analysis pipelines is indicative of how
each research group incorporates its own goals and expertise.
Some of these pipelines are available as web-based applications
wANNOVAR (Chang and Wang, 2012), VARIANT (Medina
et al., 2012), Interpretome (Karczewski et al., 2012), CRAVAT
(Douville et al., 2013) and sanff (Ren et al., 2010) and can be
used by a wider research community to facilitate genomic re-
search. We have developed an interactive web-based tool,
AVIA (Annotation, Visualization and Impact Analysis), to ex-
plore and interpret large sets of genomic variations generated by
high-throughput genomic experiments such as exome capture,
whole-genome sequencing and targeted re-sequencing projects.

AVIA was implemented by adopting the ANNOVAR Wang
et al., 2010) framework and Circos (Krzywinski et al., 2009)
Visualization options, with an emphasis on interactive annotation
and Visualization capabilities and a modularized structure that
allows facile extension of the pipelines with new tools and data-
bases as they become available.

AVIA provides a basic functional impact assessment of small
indels and single nucleotide variations based on their protein-
coding capacity and/or position-associated ability to affect
known non-coding regulatory elements and genomic features.
Several of AVIA’s workﬂows allow functional annotation and vari-
ant ﬁltering options, tumor-normal comparisons and identification
of population-specific variants. Interactive features of AVIA’s
interface permit exploratory analysis that can focus on selected
gene sets or whole-genome data, with flexible Visualization options
and resubmission of a previously established workﬂow for the ana-
lysis of new datasets. A comprehensive tutorial posted on the AVIA
site (http://avia.abcc.ncifcrf.gov/apps/site/tutorials) can guide users
from a ‘Quick-start’ example to more rigorous analytical options.

2 TOOL DESCRIPTION

AVIA’s general workflow is based on the coupling of a compre-
hensive annotation pipeline with a flexible Visualization method
(Fig. 1). This overview includes four major steps, starting with
the user submitting a variation file, through annotation and Visu-
alization modules and ending with reporting of the results.

2.1 Annotation modules and workﬂows

We leveraged the ANNOVAR framework for assigning func-
tional impact to genomic variations. AVIA expands
ANNOVAR’s capabilities in three different directions: by anno-
tation content, parallelization of data processing and implemen-
tation of new predictive options. First, we extended
ANNOVAR’s list of reference databases [RefSeq, UCSC, SIFT
(Kumar et al., 2009), Polyphen2 (Adzhubei et al., 2013), Encode
(Krupp et al., 2012), etc], with additional databases both from
recent publications by the scientific community (Supplementary
Table S1) and from our in-house-developed databases. The frame-
work was further extended by allowing the addition of third-party
annotation databases provided by the user, advancing available
filtering options and supplying access to ethnicity-specific-derived
subsets of the Complete Genomics (CG) set of 69 genomes.
Second, the original framework was adjusted to allow parallel
computations of large lists of variations by subdividing the
input set of variations into multiple subsets and querying multiple

Fig. 1. Modular structure of AVIA workﬂow. The interface allows user
to conﬁgure annotation, Visualization and reporting options

databases simultaneously. This feature allows for results to be
returned to the user in a timely manner (<15 min for 23 million
mutations for the CG dataset, depending on server load). Finally,
we added the ability to incorporate new analysis tools, thereby
expanding the predictive capabilities of the pipeline beyond the
static annotation databases (‘MiRSNP’ workﬂow).

The pipeline has been divided into workﬂows reflecting differ-
ent approaches to the annotation of large lists of genomic vari-
ations. The first workflow, “Feature Annotation,’ provides
annotation of all variations in the input list according to the
databases selected by the user. The second workﬂow, ‘Cascade
filtering,’ allows the gradual reduction of the number of the re-
sulting variations by filtering all variations identified at each an-
notation step associated with a user’s selected database. If more
complex analysis is required, it can be explored using AVIA’s
“Advanced workﬂow,’ which allows comparison between vari-
ations of two input genomes, making it a useful tool for
sample comparisons (tumor versus normal, affected versus un-
affected, child versus parent and sample versus sample’s ethni-
city-specific population genome). The annotation results are
reported in tabular format, summary diagrams and as tracks in
whole genome circular Views generated by the Circos application
(example result files are available as Supplementary Table S2).

2.2 Interactive visualization with Circos

AVIA is focused on gene-related impact assessment. Individual
Circos tracks showing, e.g. the distribution of genes with vari-
ations of specific functional effects such as non-synonymous
variations, frame shifts, variable micro RNA target sites or vari-
ations in 5’UTR—located G-quadruplexes can be produced. Users
can also choose to include additional precomputed genomic
tracks from a select list into the Circos images. Alternatively,
users may choose to display only part of the data focusing on
user-provided gene lists, genomic regions or default sets of genes
provided at AVIA’s Web site [COSMIC (Forbes et al., 2008)],
Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes pathways
(Kanehisa et al., 2012). After the selection of the tracks/analysis
of interest, users can aggregate the selected tracks in one signa-
ture plot: AVIA will produce a main Circos configuration file
with the data corresponding to all selected individual tracks, and

the new aggregated plot will be generated in several minutes
depending on the amount of traffic on the server.

3 CONCLUSION

AVIA provides fast and comprehensive analysis of large sets of
genomic variations in a user-friendly accessible manner. The
main features of the current version are its interactive options
for analysis, Visualization and speed. The workﬂows can be easily
configured to address a user’s annotation questions and de-
veloped workﬂows can be used in new analyses. Many current
software tools are focused on the analysis of the protein-coding
variants, leaving most of the other types of variants beyond the
scope of the analysis. In the future, we are planning to expand
the AVIA’s palette of non-coding impacts evaluated by the tool,
including identification of both ‘gain’ and ‘loss’ of function regu-
latory variations.

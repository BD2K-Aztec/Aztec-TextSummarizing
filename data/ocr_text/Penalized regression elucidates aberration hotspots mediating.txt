ABSTRACT

Motivation: Copy number alterations (CNAs) associated with cancer
are known to contribute to genomic instability and gene deregulation.
Integrating CNAs with gene expression helps to elucidate the
mechanisms by which CNAs act and to identify the transcriptional
downstream targets of CNAs. Such analyses can help to sort
functional driver events from the many accompanying passenger
alterations. However, the way CNAs affect gene expression can vary
in different cellular contexts, for example between different subtypes
of the same cancer. Thus, it is important to develop computational
approaches capable of inferring differential connectivity of regulatory
networks in different cellular contexts.

Results: We propose a statistical deregulation model that integrates
copy number and expression data of different disease subtypes to
jointly model common and differential regulatory relationships. Our
model not only identifies CNAs driving gene expression changes,
but at the same time also predicts differences in regulation that
distinguish one cancer subtype from the other. We implement our
model in a penalized regression framework and demonstrate in
a simulation study the feasibility and accuracy of our approach.
Subsequently, we show that this model can identify both known
and novel aspects of cross-talk between the ER and NOTCH
pathways in ER-negative-specific deregulations, when compared
with ER-positive breast cancer. This flexible model can be applied on
other modalities such as methylation or microRNA and expression to
disentangle cancer signaling pathways.

1 INTRODUCTION

Somatic copy number alterations (CNAs) are known to be
associated with cancer (Cheung and Spielman, 2009; Pollack et al.,
1999, 2002). They are particularly important for tumourigenesis,
contributing to genomic instability and gene deregulation. Array
comparative genomic hybridization (aCGH) has been used
extensively to assess genome—wide copy number states in cancer,

and statistical methods can be used to identify recurrent alterations in
a particular disease state or subtype (Chin et al., 2006, 2007; Pollack
et al., 1999, 2002). However, while some CNAs are driver mutations
that are functionally important and impact tumour progression, they
are often accompanied by numerous passenger events that confer no
selective growth advantage (Greenman et al., 2007; Pollack et al.,
2002). One of the challenges in cancer genomics is to identify
functional driver events amidst many passenger alterations.

To better understand the mechanisms by which CNAs inﬂuence
disease progression, it is necessary to integrate copy number data
with an intermediate phenotype like gene expression (Chen et al.,
2008). Integrating CNA data and RNA expression data can help
discover the primary aberrations that lead to downstream changes
(Chin et al., 2006). However, this is a challenging task for several
reasons: ﬁrst, CNAs can inﬂuence the expression of the proximal
genes within a several mega base window (cis—acting), and can
also exert effects elsewhere throughout the genome (trans—acting).
Second, CNAs can span several mega base and thus make it
difﬁcult to distinguish between driver genes and passenger genes
in this region. Thus, there is a need for new efﬁcient computational
approaches to reﬁne the location of drivers.

While describing the regulatory role of CNAs for gene expression
is already a difﬁcult task, it is only the ﬁrst step needed in
understanding how tumours differ from normal tissue and how
regulatory relationships vary between different disease subtypes.
Cancer is triggered by collaborating factors and deregulated
genes acting through signaling pathways are relevant for tumour
growth and survival (Vogelstein and Kinzler, 2004). Several known
examples of pathway deregulation result in aberrant signaling,
the inhibition of apoptosis and increased cell proliferation (Adjei
and Hidalgo, 2005). Components in the deregulation network
of signaling pathways represent attractive targets for therapeutic
purpose (Watters and Roberts, 2006). A better understanding of
the impact of CNAs on pathway activity and its variation in
different cancer subtypes would be a major step forward in molecular
medicine.

Many experimental and computational approaches have been
proposed to identify the deregulation of cellular components, such as
tumour suppressor silencing or oncogene activation, that contribute
to tumour development, based on gene expression (Alizadeh et al.,
2000; Bild et al., 2006; Furge et al., 2007; Golub et al., 1999;
Huang et al., 2003; Hummel et al., 2006; Rhodes et al., 2004; Segal
et al., 2004; Slavov and Dawson, 2009; West et al., 2001). All these
works are important steps in this ﬁeld; however, many different
regulatory events are reﬂected in gene expression, including the

activity of transcription factors, small non—coding RNAs, as well as
gene dosage. From microarray expression data alone, it is very hard
to decide which of these resulted in the observed expression change.

Investigating changes in regulatory relationships between CNAs
and gene expression in different cancer subtypes has seldom been
explored. While there is an increasing number of methods that
integrate DNA copy number data and RNA expression data (Akavia
et al., 2010; Chin et al., 2006, 2007; The Cancer Genome Atlas
Research Network, 2008), most methods that compare cancer
subtypes are geared toward supervised classiﬁcation of tumor
samples (Daemen et al., 2009; Horlings et al., 2010). Only few
integration methods address the topic of differential regulation: one
example is a bivariate approach by Sch'afer et al. (2009) to search
for abnormalities jointly at the DNA/RNA level. The abnormalities
represent strong deviations from the reference, e.g. the ampliﬁcation
of a genomic region and overexpression of the proximal gene.
Another example (that we compare against on real data) is DRI
(Salari et al., 2009), which can discover joint aberrations between
two sample classes in paired copy number and expression data. Both
methods are computationally efﬁcient, but are restricted to paired
expression and CNA proﬁles on individual genes. In other words,
these two methods can only infer cis—effects.

Here, we present DANCE (Deregulation Analysis in Networks
of Copy number—driven Expressions) a systematic approach to
decipher both common and differential regulatory mechanisms
between disease subtypes. We propose a statistical deregulation
model that integrates copy number and expression data to jointly
model common and differential regulatory relationships. Our model
not only identiﬁes CNAs driving gene expression changes, but at
the same time also predicts differences in regulation that distinguish
one cancer subtype from the other. Using one subtype as a reference,
we summarize the differential regulatory relationships of the other
subtype in a deregulation network. To our knowledge, it is the ﬁrst
model to integrate both copy number and expression data to discover
changes in the regulatory architecture between cancer subtypes.

The next section introduces our model, which, in a simulation
study over a range of different experimental settings, outperforms
alternative models and competing methods. Following, we use
DANCE to study the deregulation between estrogen receptor (ER)
positive and negative breast cancer (Chin et al., 2006), which
represent relatively good and poor outcome groups, respectively.
While DANCE is able to tackle high—dimensional problems, to
add interpretability we focus our analysis on signaling pathways.
In particular, we are interested in the cross—talk between NOTCH
and ER pathways, which may guide decisions about patients likely
to beneﬁt from Notch inhibitors. The results show that DANCE
uncovers and extends known aspects of differential ER—Notch cross—
talk in ER—positive versus—negative disease. Thus, it can be a useful
approach to infer critical aspects of pathway deregulation among
cancer subtypes.

2 A JOINT MODEL FOR DEREGULATION

Let us assume that we have copy number data for 19 independent
probes or regions X ={x1,x2,...,xp} and mRNA expression data
for q probes or genes Y ={y1,y2, ...,yq}, where each vector xi or
yj is a collection of n observations from n different individuals or
samples. Let us also suppose that the n individuals can be divided
into two groups, n1 samples from sample class 1 and n2 samples

from sample class 2. We denote as X1(n1 X p matrix) and Y1(n1 x q)
the observations from class 1, the deregulated sample class and as
X2(n2 X p) and Y2 (n2 x q) the observations from sample class 2; that
is the reference sample class.

Our goal is to integrate the two data types, X1, X2 and Y1, Y2 into
a model where the predictors are the copy number data (X 1, X2) and
the responses are the expression data (Y 1, Y2). We assume that the
expression of a particular gene can be affected by the copy number
of an arbitrary set of copy number regions, but the impact of this
inﬂuence can differ between the two groups. We can summarize the
relationship with the following equations:

Y1 = X1Br-I—X1Bd-I—61
Y2 = szr+ez (1)

where Br (p X q) and Bd (p X 6}) denotes the reference and differential
structure in the data, respectively, and 61 and 62 are Gaussian noise
with distribution of N (0,1). We assume, without loss of generality,
that both copy number and expression have been previously centered
around zero.

Parallel estimation model: we can estimate the two networks
independently and obtain the deregulation Bd subtracting one from
the other. That is,

Y1 = X131+61,
Y2 = X232+62, (2)
BAd = B] —1§2

A similar model using only expression data has been used by Zhang
et al. (2009) to study changes in transcriptional networks between
two experimental conditions.

Sequential estimation model : alternatively, we can ﬁrst infer the
reference network and secondly use this estimate to infer the
deregulation matrix Bd based on Equation (2):

Y2 = X232+62,
Y1 = X1BA2-I—X1B1-I—61, (3)
B?! = 3].

Joint estimation model: Equation (1) can be combined into one

equation:
Y1 _ X1 X1 Br 61
[Y2] — [X2 0 :| [3d + 62 ’ (4)

which can be written as

Y=x3+a (5)

. Y1 ~ X1 X1 ~ Br ~ 61
if we denote [Y2] as Y, [X2 0] as X, [Ed as B and 62 as

€~N(0, Eq). That is, the variance for each gene can be different.
This estimation scheme improves over the parallel and the sequential
methods, because it uses all the data for the estimation of all of the
parameters and does not propagate errors in subsequent steps, as the
sequential method does. The simulations in Section 3.1 also reveal
this advantage.

The matrix of coefﬁcients B has a simple biological interpretation:
each term 192,- indicates whether a predictor f,- in X is interacting
with a response variable  in 17, that is, if the copy number of a
particular probe or region has an inﬂuence on the expression of a

particular gene. The sign of this coefﬁcient indicates if this effect
is positive (gains produce upregulation) or negative (gains produce
downregulation).

In a typical dataset, the number of variables will be much larger
than the number of individuals, therefore the three models deﬁned
above can be solved with any regression method able to cope with
such a scenario. In the next section, we compare two widely used
methods, namely, the Gaussian Graphical Model (GGM) (Sch'afer
and Strimmer, 2005b) and the Partial Least Squares approach (PLS)
(Pihur et al., 2008). GGM employs a shrinkage estimator of the
covariance matrix to infer partial correlations among hundreds of
variables. This approach is designed to recover large networks from
datasets with small sample size by multiple testing of the edges
based on the local false discovery rate to detect those signiﬁcant
in the network. PLS is also a powerful tool in inferring relations
between many variables with high efﬁciency.

Alternatively, B can be obtained by providing a sparse solution
for every 51 through regression on every response variable 
with Ll—regularization (Tibshirani, 1994), also known as lasso.
L1—regression has been applied to genome—wide association studies
to delineate causal SNPs in disease (Shi et al., 2007; Wu et al.,
2009), and is particularly useful in situations where the number of
predictors far exceeds the number of samples (Tibshirani, 1997). The
lasso estimator for our model is given by optimizing the following
objective function:

 

argimnl Yj—Xﬁj llztkj “WI 1’ (6)

bJ

where kj is the regularization parameter controlling the sparsity and
strength of regularization. When kj is increased, the number of non—
zero values in 51 is reduced, so the matrix of coefﬁcients is more
sparse. It is difﬁcult to select a priori a value for Aj, therefore we use
cross—validation within a range of possible values for the parameter
using the penalized package (Goeman, 2010) with a matrix wrapper
in the 101 package in R, on which DANCE is based. Subsequently, we
ﬁt an ordinary least square regression with the non—zero coefﬁcients,
and select only the coefﬁcients with P < 0.05. This is to exclude
non—zero coefﬁcients that are not signiﬁcantly different from zero.
After choosing an optimal kj value for every expression response,
we compute the lasso solution by solving Equation (6) and obtain
the coefﬁcient matrix B. Because of the Ll—constraint in lasso, this
matrix will be sparsely populated and many coefﬁcients will be
zero. The submatrix Bd of B represents the deregulated interactions
between the copy number predictors and transcriptional responses.
The joint model with and sparse solution that we propose in DANCE
is subsequently validated with both simulated and biological data.

3 EXPERIMENTS ON SIMULATED DATA

We use simulated data to show that the joint model outperforms
the sequential and parallel models, and that Ll—inference is more
accurate than other alternatives.

We generated simulated datasets with the number of predictors
p varying from 50 to 1000 to observe the effects of predictor
numbers on accuracy. The number of responses a was ﬁxed at
10, which would not affect the inference results as the inference
for each response is carried out independently. The sample size n
for both the reference and deregulated sample group was tested
at 50 and 500. Although for a single cohort n=50 is closer to

the real scenario, with combined datasets from multiple studies
n=500 is also possible. We also added Gaussian noise N (0,02)
to the simulated data with noise level a varied from 0.2 to 0.8, as
appears in Figure 1. A sparse reference network Br was randomly
generated with [9—4 X a X 3 edges/non—zero coefﬁcients. This is to
ensure each response has a reasonable number of regulators. Then,
the deregulation network Bd was generated with a set of non—
zero coefﬁcients composed by p‘4 X a edges. All coefﬁcients were
randomly sampled from N (0,1 ). By allowing overlaps between Br
and 3", we assume that deregulations occur as a result of changes
in the strength of interactions in the reference network as well as
due to new interactions. Let X1,X2 follow multivariate Gaussian
~N(0,E) each with 19 variables of n samples, where E is the
covariance matrix, where 211 =0.2Ii_j I to introduce similarities to
adjacent variables—a feature of copy number data. Let Y2 and Y1
then be deﬁned as Y2 =XzBr and Y1 2X2 (Br +Bd). Finally, for each
combination of parameters, 100 replications of the simulations were
run incorporating a Gaussian noise to Y1, Y2 with different noise
levels.

3.1 One-step model versus two-step models

Figure 1a shows the results of Ll—regression applied to the joint,
parallel and sequential models. The performance of each of them
is measured by precision with respect to the non—zero coefﬁcients
estimated in the deregulation network Bd . First, we found that with
small sample size (n = 50), the joint model [Equation (5)] yields
consistently more accurate results than the parallel [Equation (3)]
and sequential models [Equation (4)] which learn two structures
separately. Not surprisingly, we observed low accuracies for all
models with 1000 predictors because of the small sample size. With
large sample size 500, all models perform reasonably well, which is
also expected.

3.2 Deregulated structure learning with simulated data

Now we turn to the problem of comparing different network
inference methods for estimating the deregulation network using the
joint model. We selected two existing methods that are applicable to
the small sample and large—scale problem: a GGM and the PLS
approach, and compared them with Ll—regularization. Precision
curves for the inference results are given in Figure 1b, which
correspond to the accuracy of each method in detecting non—zero
coefﬁcients in the true deregulation network 3". Again, recall curves
are not necessary as the number of true edges are given to all
methods as prior knowledge. The results for PLS when 1921000
and n=500 are missing, because for PLS these datasets are too
computationally intensive. Again, we expect low performance for
all methods when the sample size (n=50) is far smaller than the
number of predictors (p = 1000), which suggests that in this scenario
network inference is unlikely to yield reliable results. In all other
cases, DANCE outperforms the other two methods.

4 ER DEREGULATION IN BREAST CANCER

In this section, we demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed
DANCE method on real data using Chin et al. (2006) breast cancer
dataset, which consists of 89 samples assayed for both mRNA
expression and DNA CNAs. The dataset includes 55 ER positive and
34 ER negative samples and thus facilitates a study of deregulation

hence recall curves are not necessary. (3) Comparing joint, parallel and sequential models using Ll—regression. The joint model (DANCE, gray) performs

between these two major subclasses of breast cancer. It is known that
ER—negative breast cancer has worse prognosis than ER—positive
breast cancer in the early stage, and they appear to be different
diseases (Chin et al., 2007). Therefore, it is important to understand
which molecular components contribute to the deregulation between
ER—positive and ER—negative status.

4.1 DANCE points to ER—NOTCH cross-talk

First, we applied both DANCE and DRI to this dataset to
compare their utility to integrate genomic and transcriptomic
data. Interestingly, notch signaling has been implicated in
adenocarcinoma development in the mouse mammary gland
following pathway activation and the diminished expression of
NUMB, a negative regulator of the Notch pathway, in as many as
50% of breast cancer samples (Rizzo et al., 2008; Stylianou et al.,
2006). Here, we examine the results of DANCE and DRI as applied
to these two important pathways in breast cancer.

Technical details: we employed a set of 50 genes involved in the
ER (based on GO) and Notch (based on KEGG) signaling pathways
to assess the ability of DRI and DANCE to uncover meaningful
properties of this pathway in the Chin dataset.

As noted in the Section 1, DRI is an integrative tool that aims to
identify expression changes decoupled by DNA aberrations under
two conditions based on a paired t—test, when both expression and
copy number data are available for the same sample. The output is
a list of genes altered between two conditions, with the associated
conﬁdence given by a signiﬁcance score. Since it requires pair—wise
comparison, the 50 genes were mapped to 48 unique copy number
BAC probes and 107 Affymetrix expression probes. As input to the
DRI R package, 48 BAC copy number probes were paired with 107
expression probes, resulting in 107 paired data points.

In contrast, DANCE is based on L1 —regression of 48 BAC probes
on all 107 expression probes. L1—regression is a prominent method
in high—dimensional studies due to its efﬁciency in performing
sparse statistical inference in the small sample (small n), but large—
scale (large [9) setting (Tibshirani, 1997). Note that for DANCE
the reference sample class was taken to be the set of ER—positive
samples, whereas the deregulated class consisted of ER—negative
samples.

Inference results: for the DRI output, we observed a gap between
a false discovery rate (FDR) cutoff of 0.3 and 0.35 in that few
genes were identiﬁed with FDR <0.3, but a signiﬁcant increase
was seen for an FDR > 0.3 and <0.35. Hence an FDR of 0.3 was
selected for this study. Using an FDR cutoff of 0.3, nine probes (six
genes, NCOA3, ESR2, EGLNZ, PSENEN, ESR] , DVLI) were found
to be signiﬁcantly altered between ER—positive and ER—negative
conditions at both the DNA and RNA level.

Instead of merely a list of genes, DANCE is capable of inferring
the deregulation network in the ER—Notch pathways as shown in
Figure 2. The deregulation network represents an aberrant situation
where copy number and expression are coordinately deregulated in
a particular context, such as between ER—positive and ER—negative
disease. Here, an edge traverses from a node representing the
inﬂuence of copy number of a particular gene to a node representing
the expression of another gene to indicate potential regulatory
interactions. The genes denoted under the copy number heading
correspond to copy number nodes in the deregulation network and
represent the source node, whereas genes under the Expression
heading, represent the expression nodes and are the indirect or direct
downstream targets of copy number events. The count indicates the
number of times a gene appears in the network, which may result
either from multiple probes targeting the gene or else from multiple
interactions involving that gene.

Fig. 2. DANCE infers a deregulation network showing the cross—talks between ER and NOTCH pathways. Blue nodes correspond to genes in the ER pathway
while yellow denotes NOTCH pathway. Directed edges origin from the copy number instances of the genes and points to the expression instances of the

genes.

Comparing the two sets of genes, it is reassuring that ER—related
genes such as ESR1 and NCOA3 are identiﬁed by both methods.
However, the result from DANCE include several important genes
implicated in tumourigenesis that are not obtained using DRI
(Fig. 2).

Not surprisingly, a central component of the deregulated network
in ER—negative versus ER—positive breast cancer is the ER alpha,
ESR1. More speciﬁcally, the deregulation network indicates the
differential regulation of ESR1 by CREBBP, DTX3, RARA. It
is signiﬁcant that this relationship is recovered since it is well
known that ER—positive breast cancer cells are hormonally regulated
and are inhibited by retinoids, whereas ER—negative breast cancer
cells are generally not (Rosenauer et al., 1998). The retinoic
acid receptors (RARs), including RARA, are members of the
steroidthyroid hormone receptor gene family and are ligand—
dependent transcription factors, which exhibit growth inhibitory
activity against breast cancer cells (Zarubin et al., 2005).

Interestingly, increased RBPJ—dependent Notch signaling has
been shown to result in the transformation of normal breast
epithelium via the inhibition of apoptosis (Stylianou et al., 2006).
Here we show that RBPJ is deregulated in ER negative disease as a
result of aberrations in NOTCH2 copy number as are several other

downstream components of the Notch signaling pathway, including
NOTCH3 which coordinately inﬂuences NCOA3 expression levels
along with HDAC2 and NCSTN. Moreover, NOTCH3 has been
shown to play a crucial role in the proliferation of ErbB2—negative
human breast cancers, which may represent a subset of cases. One
means by which this might be effected is through alterations in
N COA3 expression levels since siRNA depletion of NCOA3 has been
shown to increase apoptosis and reduce ESR1 transcriptional activity
in the MCF—7 breast cancer cell line (Karmakar et al., 2009).
Finally, recent studies have identiﬁed cross—talk between the
ER and notch signaling pathways, and suggest novel therapeutic
approaches (Rizzo et al., 2008). These studies indicate that estrogen
inhibits NOTCH] activity by altering its cellular distribution and
suggests that estrogen affects a step of Notch activation distal to
ligand binding and directly or indirectly inhibits Notch cleavage.
In agreement with these ﬁndings, DANCE reveals that although
JAG] is frequently overexpressed in cancer (Reedijk et al., 2005)
potentially as a result of ampliﬁcation, it does not inﬂuence
N OTCH 1 expression. Rather, it may act downstream to modulate the
expression of the matrix metalloproteinase, ADAM I 7, which in turn
modulates Notch cleavage. Thus, DANCE is able to infer known
aspects of cross—talk deregulation in ER—positive versus negative

Fig. 3. Expression proﬁles of selected expression targets and their changes in correlations with their copy number regulators, as inferred by DANCE. The
expression proﬁles of the genes denoted are also plotted separately for the ER—positive cases (black) and ER—negative cases (red). The correlation between
the expression proﬁles of the genes denoted and the copy number proﬁles of upstream regulators are shown as bar plots for the ER—positive cases (black),
ER—negative cases (red) and all cases (gray). The expression proﬁles show that these genes should be ER—modulated, while the bar plots suggest that the

differential regulations may exist between ER subtypes.

disease in the absence of prior information, indicating its utility
in recovering relevant aspects of differential pathway activation in
subtypes of disease.

To further examine several of the key pathway components
highlighted above, we compared the correlation between the
expression proﬁles of these genes and the copy number states of their
putative upstream effectors (based either on pathway structure or the
output of DANCE). The expression level of each of these genes was
also examined for the ER—positive (black) and ER—negative (red)
subgroups (Fig. 3).

Here we observe that STRN3 copy number is signiﬁcantly
correlated with NOTCH] expression in ER—negative cases only.
Note that while the method does not distinguish between direct
and indirect effects, the two genes are located on different
chromosomes and hence represents trans—regulation. We also
observe that ESR1 expression levels are substantially lower in ER—
negative disease, and are positively correlated with STRN3 copy
number and negatively correlated with EP300 and MFNG copy
number in ER negative, whereas ER—positive samples do not exhibit
signiﬁcant correlation with any of the putative regulators, suggesting
differential regulatory mechanisms are at play. We note that several
of these target genes were not identiﬁed as being deregulated using
the DRI approach, which only considers cis—effects. Despite the fact
that the trans—effect of CNAs is often ignored, they represent an
important mode of regulation. In summary, we not only conﬁrm
some of our observations with the literature, but also observe
additional relationships of potential relevance.

5 DISCUSSION

The last few years have yielded an increase in the number of datasets
which include multiple genomic measurements on the same sample
and this will likely be a trend for sometime to come. However,
there are presently limited tools that facilitate the integration of
diverse data types. Furthermore, we are not aware of any method that

attempts to infer patterns of deregulation resulting from copy number
aberrations or expression alterations between groups of samples.
The proposed DANCE model is based on a simple, yet powerful
framework that beneﬁts from a sparse solution for inference of
network deregulation and with several key strengths. First, gene
expression changes are interpreted in the context of both cis— and
trans—copy number effects. Additionally, coordinated deregulation
of expression and copy number is not restricted to pairs but is open
to global search, making it possible to detect concomitant changes
in signaling cascades. Finally, the model facilitates a sparse solution
resulting in clearly interpretable deregulation network structure, thus
minimizing the inference error.

Recent approaches have focussed on transcriptional deregulation
visible as changes in the co—expression of groups (mostly pairs) of
genes (Kostka and Spang, 2004; Mentzen et al., 2009; Mo et al.,
2009; Slavov and Dawson, 2009; Xu et al., 2008). Examining sets
of differently expressed genes and successive functional analysis of
these sets (e. g. by ﬁnding enriched pathways) help point to putative
deregulated pathways across several types of cancer (Bild et al.,
2006; Edelman et al., 2008; Liu and Ringner, 2007). As mentioned
in the introduction, relying on single data source restricts our
view of the complicated biological processes underlying cancer. We
emphasize that integrating different data sources helps to circumvent
this problem and allows the identiﬁcation of candidate drivers of
gene expression changes.

We have set the deregulation inference in the context of pathways
because there is often redundancy between signaling components,
and an understanding of pathway regulation is essential for the
development of targeted therapeutics. DANCE identiﬁes pathway
components that are differentially regulated in speciﬁc cellular
contexts such as tumor subgroups, as demonstrated above. Such
an approach is also extensible to experiments in which a particular
pathway component has been perturbed via either knockdown or
overexpression, making it a useful method in hypothesis—driven
studies. In summary, DANCE is computationally efﬁcient and

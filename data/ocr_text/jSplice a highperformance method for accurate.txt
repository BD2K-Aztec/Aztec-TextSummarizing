Abstract

Motivation: Alternative splicing represents a prime mechanism of post—transcriptional gene regula—
tion whose misregulation is associated with a broad range of human diseases. Despite the vast
availability of transcriptome data from different cell types and diseases, bioinformatics—based
surveys of alternative splicing patterns remain a major challenge due to limited availability of ana—
lytical tools that combine high accuracy and rapidity.

Results: We describe here a novel junction—centric method, jSplice, that enables de novo extraction
of alternative splicing events from RNA—sequencing data with high accuracy, reliability and speed.
Application to clear cell renal carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines and 65 ccRCC patients revealed experi—
mentally validatable alternative splicing changes and signatures able to prognosticate ccRCC out—
come. In the aggregate, our results propose jSplice as a key analytic tool for the derivation of cell
context—dependent alternative splicing patterns from large—scale RNA—sequencing datasets.

1 Introduction

Alternative splicing, a mechanism unknown more than 30 years ago,
is now regarded a major contributor to transcriptome and proteome
diversity (Modrek and Lee, 2002). It is estimated that, in human,
95% of multi—exon genes undergo alternative splicing (Pan et 61].,
2008; Wang et 61]., 2008), underscoring the importance of this post—
transcriptional mechanism in the regulation of gene expression.
Indeed, many key biological processes and disease states involve pro—
found alternative splicing pattern changes (Singh and Cooper, 2012).
Nowadays, technological advances in RNA sequencing (RNA-seq)
are yielding data at an enormous scale and allow for genome—wide
analysis of alternative splicing patterns from patient data. However,

the availability of in silico tools able to reliably interrogate alternative
splicing events from RNA—seq data remains limited (Ozsolak and
Milos, 2011). For example, transcript—based approaches, such as
CuffDiff (Trapnell et al., 2012b), allow for reconstruction of the com—
plete transcriptome but are limited in their accuracy of extracted
events (Garber et 61]., 2011; Rehrauer et 61]., 2013). Exon—based
approaches, such as DEXSeq (Anders et 61]., 2012), provide more reli-
able results but due to their focus on a subset of events, yield only par—
tial information. In addition, both of these approaches suffer from
scalability issues, hindering the analysis of large—scale datasets. Hence,
there is pressing need to expand methodologies for fast and accurate
analysis of alternative splicing patterns.

Over the past few years, an increased ability to align split reads
to the genome and greater sequencing depths raised the status of
junction reads—reads that span exon—exon junctions—to an inde—
pendent and reliable source of information. To the contrary of other
reads, they permit a precise localization of exon boundaries and
allow testing whether two exons exist consecutively within a tran—
script, an essential step for the detection of alternative splicing
events. An increasing number of methods, such as DiffSplice (Hu
et al., 2013), MISO (Katz et al., 2010), JuncBASE (Brooks et al.,
2011), or SplicingCompass (Aschoff et al., 2013), are including
junction reads in their analysis but only few—e.g. Spanki (Sturgill
et al., 2013) and rMATS (Shen et al., 2014)—consider them as the
primary source of information.

Here we present jSplice, a junction—centric method to identify
differentially expressed alternative splicing events at the exon level.
Unlike Spanki and rMATS, which rely on databases of splicing
events, jSplice performs a de novo reconstruction of all possible al—
ternative splicing events based on junction positions, allowing thus
detection of simple and complex alternative splicing events even in
poorly annotated genomes. Distinctive to other currently applied
methods, jSplice does not assess the statistical significance of the
observed changes in expression between two groups of samples.
Rather it relies on a set of user—defined thresholds to select and rank
alternative splicing changes by the amplitude. The performance of
jSplice vis—a—vis other splicing analysis software tools was rigorously
assessed on simulated and real datasets and shows a greatly
enhanced sensitivity and specificity. Also, application of jSplice to
RNA sequencing datasets derived from human clear cell renal cell
carcinoma (ccRCC) cell lines and patient tumors identified validat—
able alternative splicing events. Our work suggests that jSplice is a
highly reliable and accurate method with remarkably low execution
times, making it greatly suitable for routine large—scale analysis of
RNA—seq data.

2 Methods
2.1 ThejSplice computational pipeline

jSplice, with the ‘j’ standing for ‘junction’, follows a classical alter—
native splicing analysis pipeline (Fig. 1). It starts with an external
read alignment procedure (e.g. STAR (Dobin et al., 2013) or
TopHat (Kim et al., 2013)) followed by the detection and scoring of
alternative splicing modules (ASMs) to finally generate a ranked list
of differentially expressed ASMs. Distinctive to other methods such
as DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012) or MISO (Katz et al., 2010), jSplice
detects alternative splicing modules solely based on junction pos—
itions. j Splice adopts thus a j unction—centric approach as emphasized
in Spanki and rMATS but addresses their limitations by relying on a
de novo reconstruction, as proposed in DiffSplice and JuncBASE,
and a novel scoring system. Indeed, current methods rely heavily on
genome annotations or databases of splicing events and, unlike
jSplice, might miss complex or novel alternative splicing events.

The definition of an ASM in jSplice is inspired by Hu et al.
(2013) and represents the set of exon—exon junctions of a genomic
region where transcripts diverge in more than one isoform. From
their definition of an ASM—a region of the splice graph with a sin—
gle entry point and a single exit point—one can observe that given a
junction 1' from an ASM A, there always exists a junction j in A s.t. j
overlaps position—wise with 1'. By extension, if a junction 13 overlaps
with i then [3 belongs to A. A maximal set of overlapping junctions,
which defines an ASM in jSplice, is thus the set of junctions of an
ASM as defined by Hu et al., including its nested ASMs. Retained

Fig. 1. The jSplice pipeline. Schematic outline of jSplice distinguishing data
files (light red) and software operations (light blue and light green). jSplice's
inputs are aligned RNA-seq reads from paired experiments. The call to
CoverageBed is executed within jSplice but the read alignment procedure
has to be performed independently, e.g. with STAR or TopHat

introns contain only one junction and therefore have to be treated as
special cases in jSplice that require information on exons. The latter,
if available, is added to the ASM if they are fully contained position—
wise within it but does not contribute to their identification. Note,
that the detection of all ASMs can be done in linear time once elem-
ents are sorted.

The identification of differential expression within an ASM in
jSplice differs greatly from current methods. Instead of estimating a
read count distribution, which would account for the technical and
biological variation inherent to RNA—seq experiments, jSplice only
considers the expression fold—change between conditions on every
possible pair of overlapping junctions (position—wise), or exons if
available. By definition, overlapping elements of an ASM belong to
different sets of transcripts. Therefore pairwise comparisons assess
whether there exists one or several transcripts whose expression is
changed with respect to the others. jSplice tests then, for each ASM,
all pairs of overlapping junctions and defines an ASM as differentially
expressed if there exists at least one pair that satisfies the five thresh—
olds defined below. Among all differentially expressed pairs, the one
with the maximum fold-change value is highlighted in j Splice’s output
and its average value across replicates is used as the ranking criterion
for the ASM. The rationale for using a fold—change ratio is that, due
to their ﬂanking DNA sequences, two different junctions will have
different read-binding affinities. A fold—change ratio of a single junc—
tion over two conditions will eliminate this particular bias and render
junction—junction comparisons feasible. Note that the fold—change is
still subject to technical and biological variability and thus entails as—
sessment of statistical significance. For the sake of comparison, the
popular ‘percent spliced in’ (PSI) metric (Sturgill et al., 2013) assumes
that all junctions have the same read—binding affinity.

As mentioned above, five user—defined thresholds are used to test
if a pair of overlapping junctions is differentially expressed:

— Fold—change ratio. We deﬁne the relative log2 fold—change, given
two overlapping elements 1', j of an ASM and their associated read
counts in condition A and B (CLA, CLB, CLA and c]; B), as

— relFC : log2 (OLA ALB) — log2 (517A /CLB . Inﬁnite values are returned
if counts are zeros. The absolute relFC has to be above or equal to

the user—deﬁned threshold.

— Fisher exact test. The latter is carried out on the read counts to as—
sess whether there exists, per replicate and junction pair, a non-
random difference between the two conditions. By default, a
P—value threshold of 0.05 is considered.

— Minimum read count. The threshold tc enforces a lower limit on
the read count to compute expression ratios. A valid junction pair
(Li) has ciaA Z tC and CL]; 2 tC or vice—versa (tC:20 by default). In
the case in exon pairs, length—normalized counts are used.

— Transcript inclusion percentage: The threshold t,- ensures a focus
on major transcripts or isoform switches if set to a high value. A
valid junction pair (Li) has ciaA 2 ti>l<max(ck7A|k E ASM) and CL];
2 ti>l<max(ck73|k E ASM) (t,: 10% by default). In the case of exon
pairs, length-normalized counts are used.

— Total gene expression: The threshold t, limits the analysis to well—
expressed genes (tr: 1 RPKM by default). A valid gene has a total
gene expression higher than t, in all conditions.

Similar to MISO (Katz et al., 2010), jSplice handles replicates in—
dependently. By default all thresholds have to hold in all replicates
but in case of large cohorts, one can focus on ASMs that happen in
at least N patients.

To obtain read counts per exon and genes, jSplice relies on
CoverageBed from the BEDtools package (Quinlan and Hall, 2010).
Note that jSplice distributes the CoverageBed commands—one per
sample file—to the available CPU cores (user—defined). For efficiency
reasons, the genome annotation is compared to the junction files be—
fore the call to CoverageBed is performed. Exons without any junc—
tion matching one of their extremities are discarded and new exons
are added by intersecting annotated exons with junctions. The anno-
tation is then used to assign gene names and exons to ASMs.

2.2 Data

Data simulation was performed through BEERS (Grant et al., 2011)
with the human RefSeq annotation. Two different setups were
applied. First, we generated a ‘simple’ dataset where we randomly
selected 100 multi—transcript genes on chromosome 1 and changed
the expression of the lowliest expressed transcript to twice the total
gene expression. Simulations were run in triplicates with 10M 100—
bp reads. Second, we created a ‘complex’ dataset by selecting 1000
multi—transcript genes and randomly assigning the expression of one
transcript to another value sampled from the original distribution.
Additionally, biological noise was added to each replicate in the
‘complex’ dataset as a Gaussian distribution with a standard devi—
ation of 1 RPKM. Combinations of 20 M, 50 M, 100 M of 48—bp,
100—bp, up to five replicates were used for the simulations. Unless
specified otherwise, jSplice was run with a relFC threshold of
log2(1.5), tc threshold of 10, and t,- threshold of 10% to capture all
types of events.

Real datasets were downloaded from the Gene Expression
Omnibus (GEO) database (Edgar et al., 2002) with the following ac—
cession numbers: GSE37704 (Trapnell et al., 2012a) and GSE23776
(Griffith et al., 2010). The 189 RT-PCR gel images from Griffith
et al. were visually categorized as differentially expressed or not by
Dr. Rafal Pawlowski, Dr. Peter Mirtschink and Dr. Yann Christinat
independently based on the relative band intensity. The category
was assigned in case of agreement between at least two examiners.
jSplice was run with a relFC threshold of log2(2), a tc threshold of
10 (20 for the Griffith dataset as the read length is shorter), and a t,-
threshold of 10% to capture all types of events.

Level 3 RNA—seq data from 65 ccRCC patients with matching
samples (normal and primary tumor tissues) were downloaded from
the TCGA web archive (http://tcga—data.nci.nih.gov, accessed on

November 4, 2013). As exon read count is readily available, it was
included as outlined in the jSplice pipeline. jSplice was run with a
relFC threshold of log2(2), a tc threshold of 20 (as the data consists
of 42bp reads), a t,- threshold of 50% to focus on isoform switch
events. A minimum of 5 samples had to match all criteria.
Clustering of jSplice results was performed first on the 1225 ASMs
(Ward linkage), then on samples separated by their VHL mutation
status.

2.3 Read alignment and other software

For all experiments (simulated and real data), reads where aligned
with STAR (v2.3.0)—or TopHat (v2.0.11) when specified—and the
University of California, Santa Cruz (UCSC) hg19 genome annota—
tion. All software were executed using default parameters. An FDR
value of 0.05 was used for DEXSeq (v1.8.0), rMATS (v3.0.8),
DiffSplice (v0.1.1) and SplicingCompass (v1.0.1) to enforce high
specificity. Results based on exon and junction reads were con—
sidered for rMATS. The complete database of splicing events (SE,
MXE, AFE, ALE, RI, A355 and A5SS) was used for MISO (v0.4.9)
in all cases except for the Griffith dataset where only cassette exons
(SE) were considered. A Bayes factor threshold of 3, to hold in all
replicates, was used for MISO. Multicore processing was used
whenever available and depended on the cluster load. Results for
CuffDiff2 on the Trapnell dataset and ALEXA-Seq on the Griffith
dataset were taken from their respective publications (Griffith et al.,
2010; Trapnell et al., 2012a).

2.4 Cell culture

RCC4, HEK293T and Lynex cells were cultured in DMEM supple—
mented with 10% FCS, L—Glutamine and Pen/Strep. RCC4 cells re—
expressing pVHL (‘VHL’) or control cells (‘EMPTY’) were gener-
ated by lenti— (using pLKO1) or retro—viral (pBABE) transduction as
previously described (Thoma et al., 2007; Troilo et al., 2014). Pools
of RCC4 cells stably expressing pVHL were obtained by culturing in
the presence of puromycin (2 fig/ml) for at least one week.

2.5 RNA isolation and sequencing

Total RNA was isolated using miRNeasy kit (Qiagen), including
DNase digestion step, according to the manufacturer’s protocol.
The quality of the RNA samples was verified by measuring absorb—
ance at 280 and 260 nm, assessment of rRNA 28S/18S ratio and
RNA Integrity Number (RIN). RNA sequencing was carried out at
the Beijing Genomics Institute (BGI) on an Illumina HiSeq 2000 se—
quencer and resulted in 50 M of 100—bp paired—end reads per sam—
ple. Reads were aligned with STAR on hg19 and UCSC annotations.
jSplice was run with a relFC threshold of log2(2), a tc threshold of
10 (as the data consists of 100 bp reads), and a t,- threshold of 50%
to focus on major isoforms only. Data are available under accession
number SRP045 624 at http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra.

2.6 lmmunoblot analysis

Cells were lysed directly on the dish using standard 2>< SDS sample
buffer. Protein samples were sonicated, resolved on acrylamide gels,
transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and visualized using anti—
bodies against pVHL (Hergovich et al., 2003), HIF1 (Novus
NB100-479), HIF2 (Novus NB100-122) and GLUT1 (Abcam
ab14683)

2.7 Gene and RNA isoform expression analysis by
quantitative and semi—quantitative PCR

2—3 ,ug of total RNA was reverse—transcribed into cDNA using
EcoDry Premix Random Hexamers kit (Clontech) according to the
manufacturer’s instructions. cDNA samples were then analyzed by
real time PCR using LightCycler 480 SYBR Green (Roche) and pri-
mer pairs designed to recognize either the specific RNA isoforms or
the total mRNA. Semi—quantitative PCR was carried out using
PrimeSTAR Max DNA Polymerase (Clontech) and primer pairs de—
signed to bind exons ﬂanking the alternatively spliced regions.
Subsequently, PCR products were resolved on 2% agarose gels and
visualized using a UV lamp. The primer pairs used in this study with
the corresponding sequences are listed in supplementary material
(Supplementary Table SS).

3 Results

3.1 jSplice is a fast and accurate method to detect
differentially expressed alternative splicing events

As no benchmark dataset exists to validate methods for the detec—
tion of differential alternative splicing, we first employed simulated
data. For that purpose, we used BEERS (Grant et al., 2011), a simu—
lation engine for generating RNA—seq data to create two different
scenarios. The ‘simple’ dataset contains no biological variation and
introduces obvious splicing changes (median fold—change of 4.43,
5% percentile at 4.01, IQR of 2.15) while the ‘complex’ dataset had
biological variation and a wider range of splicing changes (median
fold—change of 2.80, 5% percentile at 1.09, IQR of 5.42). We then
compared the performance of jSplice with several other currently
available methods. We included software that have a broad user
base (DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012), MISO (Katz et al., 2010) and
rMATS (Shen et al., 2014)), that introduced the notion of ASMs
(DiffSplice (Hu et al., 2013)) and that has just recently been released
(SplicingCompass (Aschoff et al., 2013)). We define a true positive
as a gene where at least one of the originally changed alternative
exon was correctly identified by the method.

On the ‘simple’ dataset, jSplice provides by far the shortest run—
ning time when compared to other methods (Fig. 2a). A comparison
of jSplice and DEXSeq, which is second to jSplice, shows a 28—fold
improvement when accounting for the number of cores. In terms of
accuracy, jSplice displays the highest specificity and sensitivity
(Fig. 2b). Its F—score—a performance measure that combines sensi—
tivity and specificity into one single value—is largely superior to the
second best method: DEXSeq (0.77 for jSplice and 0.51 for
DEXSeq). DEXSeq compares favorably against rMATS and MISO
as it provides a higher sensitivity and similar specificity. DiffSplice
identified only three genes with differential alternative splicing and
two turned out to be true positives. SplicingCompass, for an un-
known reason and despite our best efforts, kept returning an error.
Of note, all but 3 true positives identified by rMATS were also iden—
tified by jSplice (Chi—square test P—value of 2.75 X 10_5). To the ex—
ception of MISO, no bias in genes with low total expression was
observed in any method (Fig. 2c).

As jSplice depends on the quality of the read alignment, we
tested its performance using TopHat instead of STAR. Regarding
the alignment performance, TopHat detected on average fewer true
junctions than STAR (18 649 versus 18 820) but demonstrated a
better specificity (93% versus 90%). However, the junction read
count of STAR showed a better correlation to the true junction read
count (Pearson’s rho of 0.995 versus 0.961). In terms of jSplice’s ac—
curacy, it translated into a slightly lower specificity (89% versus

‘All (truth)' represents the 100 genes that were originally modified to have dif-

93%) with TopHat. A comparison with the true alignment, i.e. as
defined by the simulation engine, revealed that the read aligner has
little inﬂuence on jSplice (Supplementary Fig. S1). Lastly, the run—
ning time of the two methods differs enormously. While it took only
8 min per file for STAR, TopHat completed the task in 2 h and
34 min, a 20-fold difference.

jSplice’s method relies on junctions as a primary source of infor-
mation and then complements this with exons (‘optional step’ in
Fig. 1). In principle, this second step can be skipped resulting in a
small drop in sensitivity—65% to 61%—without affecting specifi—
city (93% versus 94%). This indicates that even though exon infor-
mation is beneficial, junction reads are the main contributors to
jSplice’s accuracy.

Based on these results, it appears that j Splice demonstrates super—
iority over MISO, rMATS, SplicingCompass, DiffSplice and
DEXSeq in detecting major splicing changes in the absence of biolo—
gical noise. Importantly, it provides a tremendous speedup when
compared to all tested software, enabling thus the analysis of large
datasets.

3.2 jSplice is robust to biological noise and

parameter changes

Application of jSplice and its two closely related analytical tools
(DEXSeq and rMATS) on the ‘complex’ dataset confirmed its ad—
vantages in identifying genomic regions with consequent alternative
splicing changes (Fig. 3a). Interestingly, in the presence of biological
noise, DEXSeq’s performance dropped. Nonetheless, if test criteria
were relaxed to focus at genes only, that is irrespective of the identi—
fied exons, DEXSeq’s sensitivity raises to 26% but remains inferior
to rMATS and jSplice (35% and 37%). Quite noticeably, rMATS
and jSplice share only two third of their true positives (Fig. 3b).
However, jSplice was able to identify many true positives identified
by DEXSeq but not by rMATS. This tends to indicate that j Splice is
able to capture a wider and different range of splicing events than
DEXSeq or rMATS. An analysis of sensitivity with respect to the
amplitude of the true change revealed that jSplice’s sensitivity in—
creases with the amplitude of the change (Fig. 3c). A similar behav—
ior is observed with rMATS and DEXSeq but rMATS seems to
plateau at 5 0% sensitivity.

jSplice relies on four user—defined thresholds (relative fold—
change, minimum read count, Fisher’s exact test P—value and inclu—
sion percentage) and consequently their inﬂuences on the results
were tested. For the simulations, true alignments were used to dis—
card any bias induced by the read aligner. One could observe that al—
though the removal of one or another threshold affects the
sensitivity or specificity of jSplice, its F—score remained unchanged
(Supplementary Fig. S2a). Additionally, smaller coverage (20M
reads), lack of replicates, or use of 48—bp reads (Supplementary Fig.
S2b, c and d), reduces the amount of available information and im-
pacts the performance of jSplice. This however translates into a
lower sensitivity and a higher specificity, affecting, in the end, only
moderately the accuracy of jSplice. An increase in the total number
of reads (100 M) or the use of more than two replicates did not actu—
ally improve jSplice’s accuracy (Supplementary Fig. 82b and d). For
the sake of comparison, we investigated the use of rMATS’ param—
eter to threshold the amplitude of the splicing change—a parameter
similar to our relative fold—change threshold—but did not observe
any improvement of its accuracy, rather a trade—off between sensitiv—
ity and specificity (Supplementary Fig. S3).

Taken together, the results from the ‘simple’ and the ‘complex’
simulations suggest that the ﬂexibility offered by the four thresh—
olds, the presence of biological noise, or the use of different RNA-
seq setups, does not inﬂuence the high specificity of jSplice. Splicing
changes identified by jSplice may therefore by more likely validat—
able through PCR reactions of biological material.

3.3 Application oijplice to real data sets confirms its
rapidity and accuracy

Simulated data have their limitations and hence we tested jSplice on
two publicly available datasets from Griffith et al. (2010) and
Trapnell et al. (2012a). Griffith et al. performed RNA—sequencing
on ﬂuorouracil—resistant and —nonresistant human colorectal cancer
cell lines (50 M of 42—bp reads, no replicates) and assessed 189 cas—
sette exons by RT—PCR, which makes it the most extensively tested
dataset for differential alternative splicing to date. Based on those
results, we categorized each cassette exon as differentially expressed
(DE) or not, resulting in 41 DE events (38 genes) and 77 non—DE
events (77 genes) (Supplementary Table S1). Using this dataset, we
observed striking differences between different methods (Fig. 4a).
rMATS returned only 7 genes whereas jSplice, MISO and ALEXA-
Seq yielded 280, 324 and 1724 genes respectively. Of note, all three

cates and could not be run on this dataset. The number in parenthesis repre-
sents the total number of PCR-tested genes identified by each method. For
instance, among the differentially spliced genes identified by jSplice, 10 were
tested by PCR by Griffith et al. and 7 were validated as differentially spliced.
(b) Result comparison of several methods on the Trapnell dataset. Execution

true positives identified by rMATS were also identified by jSplice,
which is consistent with the results on simulated data. Even though
jSplice and MISO identified a similar number of events, the agree—
ment between the two methods was weak; 43 common genes.
Nonetheless, for a similar number of genes in the RT—PCR validated
set, jSplice greatly outperformed MISO. Note that the gene selection
for the PCR validation was based on the results from ALEXA—seq,
which introduces a bias. DEXSeq, DiffSplice and SplicingCompass
require replicates and hence could not be run on the Griffith dataset.

Trapnell et al. performed RNA-sequencing on a H OXA1 knock-
down experiment in human fibroblasts and RNA—sequencing (20 M
of 100—bp reads in triplicates). However, few alternatively spliced
genes were validated through PCR experiments. Application of j Splice
and other methods to the Trapnell dataset revealed an extensive dis—
agreement in terms of identified genes with differential alternative
splicing (Fig. 4b). SplicingCompass failed to complete the task (un—
known error) and DiffSplice returned no results at a 10% FDR.
DEXSeq predicted the highest number of genes with DE splicing
events (250 genes), but only 10% of these were also identified by an—
other method, suggesting low specificity. Consistent with the results
on the Griffith dataset, rMATS identified few genes and all were de—
tected by jSplice and at least another method, suggesting low sensitiv—
ity but high specificity for rMATS. In general, two thirds of the genes
identified by several methods were also identified by jSplice, which
hints at a high specificity. In their original publication, Trapnell et al.
(2012a) selected 4 genes with DE transcripts for PCR validation:
TBX3, CDC14B, ORC6 and CDKZ. However, with the exception of
DEXSeq, which detected CDC14B and jSplice, which identified
TBX3, no other method reported any of the four genes.

The two above—mentioned datasets represent examples of RNA—
seq experiments performed with biological samples and thus can be
used to assess jSplice’s speed improvement over existing methods.
Consistent with the results on the simulated data, jSplice provides a
massive speedup over existing methods (Fig. 4c and d). Accounting

for the difference in computing cores, it yielded a 65 —fold improve—
ment over DEXSeq on the Trapnell dataset. In conclusion, a test on
two public real datasets confirmed the results from the simulated
data—a tremendous speedup and a superior accuracy—and revealed
large discrepancies in results between state—of—the—art methods.

3.4 Experimental examination of VHL tumor
suppressor—regulated alternative splicing changes in
renal carcinoma cell lines
Tumorigenesis is associated with profound alternative splicing
changes affecting virtually all aspects of cancer biology (Oltean and
Bates, 2013; Sette et al., 2013) but only a handful of genes have
been well characterized with respect to their splicing isoform func-
tion in tumor formation, growth and metastasis. Biallelic inactiva—
tion of the von Hippel—Lindau (VHL) tumor suppressor gene is a
signature feature of ccRCC but its potential role in alternative splic—
ing regulation has not been yet investigated. To investigate the mat—
ter, we engineered RCC4 renal cell carcinoma cells, which are VHL-
deficient, to re—express the VHL gene product pVHL, and carried
out transcriptome sequencing in cells expressing VHL (RCC4-VHL)
and control cells (RCC4—EMPTY). Western blot analysis of the pro—
tein samples confirmed pVHL re—expression, as well as diminished
abundance of pVHL’s degradation targets HIF1 and HIF2 and re-
pression of GLUT1, a prominent target of HIF regulation (Fig. 5a).
Total gene expression levels from the RNA—sequencing results con—
firmed inhibition of canonical HIF target genes EGLN3, LDHA
and SLC2A1 in RCC4-VHL cells, whereas ACTB remained un—
changed (Fig. 5 b). Thus, the :VHL RCC4 cell line pair functionally
recapitulates the situation of VHL inactivation in RCC.

To obtain insight into the regulation of alternative splicing by
VHL, we analyzed the RNA sequencing results with jSplice and
identified four genes—MYO6 (myosin VI), DNMT3B (DNA

(cytosine—5)—methyltransferase 3 beta), NEDD4L (neural precursor
cell expressed, developmentally down—regulated 4—like, E3 ubiquitin
protein ligase) and TM CC1 (transmembrane and coiled—coil domain
family 1)—whose transcript abundance was consistently altered
across three independent pVHL re—introduction experiments (Fig.
5c; genomic coordinates of the identified ASMs are given in
Supplementary Table S2). A comparative analysis using
SplicingCompass, DiffSplice, DEXSeq, rMATS and MISO on the
pVHL re—introduction RNA—seq samples revealed no overlap across
methods except for genes identified by jSplice, which were, to the
exception of TMCC1, all identified by at least another method.
Again, a huge reduction in execution time was observed for jSplice
when compared to the other methods.

In order to verify the results of the software analysis, we per—
formed real time quantitative PCR (qPCR) measurement of specific
gene transcripts as well as total gene expression. In all four cases,
qPCR results concurred with the in silico analysis (Fig. 5d).

The analysis by qPCR allows quantitative measurements of
mRNA species across conditions, but it does not provide direct in—
formation about the relative contribution of each mRNA transcript
to the total gene expression. Consequently, we carried out a semi—
quantitative PCR analysis using a similar setup. Results recapitulate
the quantitative isoform measurements by real—time qPCR, which
are an isoform switch for M Y06 and the up—regulation of an alter—
native transcript for DNMT3B and NEDD4L (Fig. 5e).
Experimental validation confirmed thus the findings of jSplice.

3.5 Application of jSplice identifies tumor—specific
alternative splicing events in human kidney cancer

Next, we set out to further identify genes undergoing alternative
splicing in ccRCC and assess the applicability of jSplice to large—
scale datasets. To this end, we analyzed a previously described gen—
omic data from the TCGA consortium from 65 ccRCC patients
(Supplementary Table S3) and identified 1225 ASMs with a relative
fold—change superior to 2 in at least 5 patients (Fig. 6a and
Supplementary Table S4). In this regard, we note that jSplice ana—
lyzes each patient independently and does not attempt to identify
splicing events significantly changed across the whole cohort. This
allows, in turn, for an independent and subsequent clustering ana—
lysis of the identified splicing events in order to identify subgroups
within the cohort. Exon read counts were already provided by the
TCGA and hence removed the need to perform CoverageBed calls,
which in turn allowed the analysis to complete in a mere 45 min on
a desktop computer. A similar analysis executed with MISO or
rMATS would have taken weeks to complete and required a few
terabytes of disk space. The application of DEXSeq or DiffSplice is
not possible due to the availability of only one sample per patient.

Of the four splicing events identified in the VHL re—introduction
experiment, only M YO6 was also reported in the jSplice analysis of
the TCGA data. DNMT3B is too lowly expressed to meet the read
count threshold, the short transcript of NEDD4L is never a major
one, and the short junction of TM CC1 is not reported. Nonetheless,
an expression analysis at the exon level confirmed that the splicing
changes identified in RCC4 cell lines upon VHL re—introduction do
also occur in patients (Supplementary Fig. S3). Of note, the VHL
mutation rate in the 65 patients is of 55% but did not reveal any
pattern in alternative splicing (Fig. 6a).

In the TCGA data, jSplice detected a FGFRZ (fibroblast growth
factor receptor 2) mRNA isoform switch (Fig. 6b), which had al-
ready been reported (Zhao et al., 2013), and a cassette exon in S YK
(spleen tyrosine kinase), whose tyrosine kinase protein product is a

represents patients below the threshold. In (b), (c) and (d) events identified by
jSplice are outlined in orange. Splice graphs, with alternative exons in gray,
were inferred from UCSC annotations

key regulator of immune signaling (Fig. 6c) (Lowell, 2011; Mocsai
et al., 2010). Up—regulation of the long isoform of S YK has been pre-
viously reported in breast and ovarian cancers (Klinck et al., 2008;
Prinos et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2003) but has not been yet associ—
ated to ccRCC.

Another interesting example from jSplice’s results is the MAP
kinase interacting serine/threonine kinase 2 (MKNK2). Alternative
splicing of MKNK2 has been recently shown to be a tumor—promot—
ing mechanism present in breast, lung and colon cancer (Maimon
et al., 2014). The pro—oncogenic isoform, MKNKZb, lacks the
MAPK-binding site but enhances protein synthesis. Based on junc—
tion information, we could observe that the MKNKZb mRNA tran-
script has a higher expression in tumor tissue (Fig. 6d). To assess
whether its expression with respect to the MKNKZa transcript cor—
relates with patient outcome, 475 ccRCC patient samples from the
TCGA archive were stratified into two equally sized groups based
on their MKNKZb/MKNKZa ratio. Kaplan—Meier plots showed that
patients with high levels of MKNKZb display a significantly worse
overall survival (log—rank P—value: 5.95 X 107, Fig. 6e).

To conclude, a j Splice analysis of 65 ccRCC mRNA samples identi—
fied, in less than an hour, multiple alternative splicing events associated
to ccRCC. Alternative splicing of MYO6, which was linked to VHL in
RCC4 cells, has been confirmed in ccRCC patient data. Furthermore,
this analysis revealed several other splicing events that were previously
reported in other cancer types but not in clear cell renal cell carcinoma
providing a new entry point for treatment for ccRCC.

4 Discussion

Recent studies concur that most if not all of human multi-exon genes
yield multiple splice isoforms through alternative splicing.
Alternative splicing is also highly context—dependent and promotes
an enormous diversification of gene function that dictates tissue dif—
ferentiation, development and, when misregulated, disease develop—
ment. With transcriptomes of different tissues and disease states
becoming readily available through the application of high-through-
put RNA—sequencing, analytical methods to distinguish and quantify
mRNA isoforms hold the potential for an unbiased and thorough in—
sight into alternative splicing. However, data analysis is not trivial
and, as a result, the development of software for fast, reliable and ul—
timately routine detection of alternative splicing lags currently be—
hind the sequencing capabilities. The development of jSplice
described here provides an important advance as it provides a
method of unmatched specificity, sensitivity and rapidity for the
analysis of AS events, key elements that currently hinder the compre—
hensive analysis of large—scale experiments. Thus, jSplice is highly
suitable for reliable analysis of alternative splicing events in large—
scale transcriptome data. Application of jSplice on RNA—seq data—
sets of renal carcinoma cells and human ccRCC tissues revealed
novel, validatable VHL— and renal cancer—dependent alternative
splicing events substantiating the value of jSplice as an analytical
tool for genome—wide analysis of AS events.

jSplice relies on a novel junction—based definition of alternative
splicing modules that allows for a rapid detection of alternative splic—
ing events, simple or complex, without having to rely on a predefined
set of transcripts such as implemented in rMATS or MISO. The con-
cept of ASMs confers generality while keeping complexity at a low
level but the associated software, DiffSplice, suffers from high execu-
tion time and low accuracy. Another key feature of jSplice is its en—
tirely different method for the assessment of differential expression.
That is, to focus on expression fold—change instead of modeling biolo—
gical and technical variations. Models of read count distribution are
necessary to estimate transcript abundance for a given experiment and
to assess the statistical significance of the change. However a simple
fold—change threshold, as implemented in jSplice, seems, in practice,
sufficient to detect large splicing changes in comparisons of experi-
ments. Supporting that argument, Rehrauer et al. (2013) recently
pointed out that a fold—change measurement is sufficient to identify
differential expression of genes. Of note, as the complexity of an ASM
increases, so does the number of pairwise comparisons, which in-
creases the possibility of identifying a false positive. In this specific
state, j Splice may potentially overreport complex ASM. Variability be—
tween replicates is inherent to biological experiments and, in the con-
text of our simulations, affected all tested methods. Nonetheless
jSplice aims at ranking splicing events by the amplitude of the change
in order to provide a list of validatable genes for experimental biolo—
gists. In that respect the larger changes are potentially the most rele—
vant ones and jSplice showed a better accuracy than DEXSeq and
rMATS in detecting those. Additionally, we demonstrated that the use
of a different read aligner, different parameters, or a different RNA-
sequencing setup did not impact jSplice’s high specificity.

Application of jSplice to detect alternative splicing events in
renal carcinoma cells as a function of pVHL status identified alter—
native splicing events in MYO6, DNMT3B, NEDD4L and
TMCC1. Since loss of VHL represents a signature lesion in human
ccRCC, it is attractive to consider that one or more of these changes
in alternative splicing contribute, in part, to renal carcinogenesis.

by jSplice in both cell lines experiment and TCGA data, moves

toward the minus end of actin filaments and is involved in the trans—
port of vesicles and organelles (Tumbarello et al., 2013). The three
exons that we found alternatively spliced in renal carcinoma cells
encode a fragment referred to as ‘long insert’ located in the cargo
binding tail of myosin VI (Buss et al., 2001; Tumbarello et al.,
2013). Thus, the presence of the ‘long insert’ may affect motor—cargo
interactions. It may also confer preferential expression in polarized
cells (such as kidney cells (Buss et al., 2001; Hasson, 2003)). As the
long isoform of Myosin VI is more abundant in pVHL-proficient
renal carcinoma cells and in healthy tissue compared to tumor, it is
conceivable that a myosin VI switch from the long to the short iso—
form may contribute to the loss of polarization of transformed kid—
ney cells. DNMT3B is implicated in chromatin methylation and has
been previously shown to be differentially spliced in multiple cancer
types (Klinck et al., 2008; Ostler et al., 2007; Saito et al., 2002;
Vasanthakumar et al., 2013; Venables et al., 2008; Wang et al.,
2007). Also the alternative exon identified in this study has been pre—
viously shown to discriminate between pluripotent and differenti-
ated cells (Gopalakrishna—Pillai and Iverson, 2011). Thus, pVHL-
dependent changes in DNMT3B splicing may be added to the grow—
ing list of chromatin modifying enzymes functionally altered in
human ccRCC. NEDD4L has been shown to regulate TGF—beta sig—
naling (Gao et al., 2009) and its gene expression has been associated
with several cancers (Hu et al., 2009; Sakashita et al., 2013;
Tanksley et al., 2013). However the reported alternative splicing
event has not been explored. TMCC1 is the least studied of the four
genes identified in the jSplice analysis in renal carcinoma cells. In a
recent study, it has been shown to anchor in the endoplasmic reticu—
lum (ER) to regulate ER membrane organization and the attachment
of ribosomes to the ER (Zhang et al., 2014). The short isoform iden-
tified in this study would encode only the C—terminal transmem—
brane domain and create a loss of function.

It has been previously reported that splicing events are not neces—
sarily specific to one cancer type, but rather that common splicing sig—
natures exist (Klinck et al., 2008; Oltean and Bates, 2013; Sette et al.,
2013; Venables et al., 2008, 2009; Zhao et al., 2013). Consistent with
this notion, our j Splice analysis of RNA—seq data from human ccRCC
obtained from the TCGA archive unveiled potentially generic alterna—
tive splicing events in S YK (previously shown to occur in breast and
ovarian cancer (Klinck et al., 2008; Prinos et al., 2011; Wang et al.,
2003)), and MKNK2 (found in breast, lung and colon cancers
(Maimon et al., 2014)). In the case of MKNK2, we observed a highly
significant correlation between the relative expression of the MKNK2
isoforms and patient outcome. Given the very encouraging reports on
the recent development of orally available small molecule splicing
modifiers for the treatment of spinal muscular atrophy (Naryshkin
et al., 2014), it will be exciting to explore the possibility of targeting
MKNK2 alternative splicing as a line of therapy in cancer.

AS analysis of large—scale patient data, such as provided by the
TCGA, is currently unachievable with other software such as
DEXSeq (Anders et al., 2012) or rMATs (Shen et al., 2014). Their
long execution time or their inability to use read counts as inputs
renders them impractical for large—scale analyses. In that respect,
jSplice offers a convenient and fast solution. As a consequence, a
pan—cancer analysis of alternative splicing in patient data is now
feasible and may reveal potential splicing signatures suitable for
diagnostic and therapeutic applications.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: In this article, we develop a novel edge-based network
i.e. edge-network, to detect early signals of diseases by identifying the
corresponding edge-biomarkers with their dynamical network bio-
marker score from dynamical network biomarkers. Specifically, we
derive an edge-network based on the second-order statistics repre-
sentation of gene expression profiles, which is able to accurately rep-
resent the stochastic dynamics of the original biological system (with
Gaussian distribution assumption) by combining with the traditional
node-network, which is based only on the first-order statistics repre-
sentation of the noisy data. In other words, we show that the stochas-
tic network of a biological system can be described by the integration
of its node-network and its edge-network in an accurate manner.
Results: By applying edge-network analysis to gene expressions of
healthy adults within live influenza experiment sampling at time points
before the appearance of infection symptoms, we identified the edge-
biomarkers (80 edges with 22 densely connected genes) discovered in
edge-networks corresponding to symptomatic adults, which were
used to predict the subsequent outcomes of influenza infection. In
particular, we not only correctly predict the final infection outcome
of each individual at an early time point before his/her clinic symptom
but also reveal the key molecules during the disease progression. The
prediction accuracy achieves ~90% under the leave-one-out cross-
validation. Furthermore, we demonstrate the superiority of our method
on disease classification and predication by comparing with the con-
ventional node-biomarkers. Our edge-network analysis not only opens
a new way to understand pathogenesis at a network level due to the
new representation for a stochastic network, but also provides a
powerful tool to make the early diagnosis of diseases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Time-course data are increasingly used to study dynamical biolo-
gical processes or disease progression, like drug treatment or virus
infection that evolves in a stochastic and temporal fashion Wu
and Wu, 2013). Instead of a snapshot of gene expression, the time-

course gene expression over several continuous time points, allows
investigators to study or even predict dynamic behaviors of a bio-
logical system (Huang et al., 2011; Wu and Wu, 2013). Based on
high-throughput time-course data, although there are extensive
works to identify molecular biomarkers for diagnosing complex
diseases, it is strongly demanded to develop a systematical frame-
work by exploiting such dynamical and stochastic information to
predict early signals of disease states and also their occurrence
times from both theoretical and computational viewpoint,
which is also crucial to achieve predictive and preventive medicine
(Liu et al., 2013a, b). In particular, molecular network is widely
used to analyze the molecular response (Oates and Mukherjee,
2012; Zhi et al., 2013) as well as biomarkers for distinguishing
disease and normal samples. Traditionally, a molecular network
with node (e.g. gene or protein) as basic element, i.e. node-
network, is constructed mainly in the following two ways: one is
to extract the conditional existence of known molecular inter-
actions, which consist of a subnetwork induced from a given
background network (Chuang et al., 2007), such as Weighted
Correlation Network Analysis (Zhang and Horvath, 2005); the
other is to directly infer de novo molecular associations, which
represent a significant topological structure connecting
molecules (He et al., 2012; Margolin et al., 2006; Zhang et al.,
2012), such as ARACNE (Margolin et al., 2006), InferGRN
Wang et al., 2006) and NARROMI (Zhang et al., 2013). This
network can represent associations or interactions among mol-
ecules but cannot directly describe the stochastic dynamics of a
biological system.

Generally, a biological system at a molecular level can be
described by stochastic dynamics modeled by a master equation
(Chen et al., 2010; Van Kampen, 1992). As shown in Figure 1,
with the linearization and Gaussian distribution assumption, the
system can be exactly expressed by two sets of equations, i.e. one
for the mean vector of molecules (used in first-order statistics
representation) and another for the covariance matrix of mol-
ecules (used in second-order statistics representation). However,
the traditional molecular network, e.g. gene network or protein
interaction network, is based only on the equations of mean
vector rather than the equations of covariance matrix, e.g. a
set of linear equations for molecular concentrations, which
cannot represent whole stochastic dynamics of the original
system (i.e. it is the representation of a biological system without
any stochastic ﬂuctuation or with zero noise). Different from

Fig. 1. Node-network and edge-network for a biological system. A bio-
logical system at a molecular level can be modeled as a master equation,
where P is the probability of x; W is the propensity function; x is the
numbers or concentrations of molecules following Gaussian distribution
with a mean vector p. and a covariance matrix a and S is the changes of
molecules. By liberalizing the master equation, we have two sets of the
equations, i.e. one is linear equations corresponding to the traditional
molecular network or node-network, which is based only on the ﬁrst-
order statistics information or average values of molecules, and another is
Lyapunov differential equations corresponding to our edge-network,
which is based on the second-order statistics information or covariance
between molecules. Theoretically, the information from those two-level
statistics can fully recover the stochastic dynamics of the original system.
The ﬁrst-order statistics information or traditional node-network is used
to distinguish the disease and normal samples for disease diagnosis by
identifying molecular biomarkers or node biomarkers, whereas the
second-order statistics information or edge-network is able to distinguish
the predisease and normal samples by identifying edge biomarkers or
DNBs, thereby achieving the early diagnosis or the prediction of the
disease

those conventional node-networks, we propose a new edge-based
network, i.e. edge-network, to exploit higher-order statistics in-
formation among molecules, where a node represents a pair of
the connecting nodes, i.e. an edge in the traditional node-
network. As indicated in Figure 1, the edge-network is based
on the covariance matrix of molecules governed by Lyapunov
differential equation (Ichikawa et al., 2009). In an edge-network,
a node is not a molecule but a pair of molecules (i.e. an edge),
and a link represents the relationship between two molecule pairs
(i.e. between two edges) rather than between two molecules as in
a node-network. Clearly, an edge-network reﬂects the second-
order statistics information, and therefore theoretically with
Gaussian distribution assumption on each molecule’ expression
it is able to recover stochastic dynamics of the original biological
system by combining with the node-network (ﬁrst-order
statistics).

Recent studies (Chen et al., 2012; Li et al., 2013; Liu et al.,
2012, 2013a) show that the second-order statistics information
can be used to predict the predisease state (the state of an indi-
vidual before the appearance of clinical symptom) and thus
achieve the early diagnosis of a disease by detecting its dynamical
network biomarker (DNB), in contrast to the molecular network

Fig. 2. Disease progression, DNBs and time-course gene expression pro-
ﬁles of 17 healthy adults within live inﬂuenza experiment. (A) The pro-
gression of the inﬂuenza infection can be considered to have three stages,
i.e. (i) normal stage with the gradual progression of the disease, (ii) pre-
disease stage that is considered as the limit of the normal stage just before
the symptom appears and (iii) disease or infection stage after the symp-
tom appears. (B) Edge-biomarkers or DNBs are able to identify the
predisease stage due to dynamical and higher-order statistics information,
and therefore predict the outcome of the inﬂuenza infection before the
symptom appears. (C) The biological time-course expression data con-
tains 17 subjects challenged with inﬂuenza H3N2/Wisconsin, for which, 9
subjects are infected (Sx), whereas 8 subjects stay healthy (Asx) ﬁnally.
Gene expression proﬁles were obtained and measured on whole periph-
eral blood drawn from all subjects at an interval of 8 h post inoculation
(hpi) through 108 hpi. In all, 268 gene microarrays were obtained for all
subjects at 16 time points including baseline (—24 hpi). For the purpose of
the prediction, we only use the data with non-symptom to identify the
edge-biomarkers

that is mainly used to identify molecular biomarkers or node-
biomarkers for the diagnosis of a disease. Thus, one major ad-
vantage of the edge-network is its predictive power for early
diagnosis of a disease, which can not only predict the future
occurrence of a disease but also estimate the critical time when
the change from a normal to a disease state happens. As shown
in Figure 2A, the progression of the disease progression,
e.g. inﬂuenza infection can be considered to have three stages
(or states), i.e. (i) normal stage possibly with the gradual pro-
gression of the disease, (ii) predisease stage that is considered as
the limit of the normal stage just before the disease symp-
tom appears and (iii) disease or infection stage after the disease
symptom appears (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012, 2013a).
Our edge-biomarkers derived from the edge-network are able

to identify the predisease stage due to its dynamical and add-
itional covariance information, and therefore predict the out-
come of the complex disease (e.g. inﬂuenza infection) before
the clinic symptom appears (Fig. 2B).

Speciﬁcally, by applying edge-network analysis to 268 gene
expression proﬁles of 17 healthy adults within 16 time points
across the whole live inﬂuenza experiment (Huang et al., 2011),
we discovered 80 edges (with 22 densely connected genes)
involved in edge-networks of most symptomatic adults before
the appearance of clinic symptom, which were used as edge-
biomarkers to predict the subsequent outcomes of inﬂuenza
infection for each individual. Our results indicated that those
edge-biomarkers in this case have similar dynamical features to
DNB (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012, 2013a, 2013b). In par-
ticular, the results show that these edge-biomarkers can predict
the outcomes of inﬂuenza infection with 90% accuracy under
leave-one—out cross-validation (LOOCV), i.e. not only predict
the ﬁnal infection outcome of each individual or subject but
also estimate the early time point of the subsequent infection.
Furthermore, we compare the results with the conventional bio-
markers and methods, and also conduct the functional analysis
on the edge-biomarkers, which all demonstrate the superiority of
our method on disease classiﬁcation and prediction. We also
investigate the molecular mechanism of the disease development
after virus infection by analyzing the identiﬁed key molecules at
the critical time points. In all, our edge-network analysis opens a
new way to deeply understand disease progression, e. g. inﬂuenza
virus-induced pathogenesis from dynamical features and higher-
order statistics information of big biological data, and also pro-
vides a powerful tool to prevent disease occurrence or make the
early diagnosis of a disease for each individual.

2 METHODS

We ﬁrst describe the biological data used to study inﬂuenza infection;
then provide the mathematical basis of edge-network; next display our
computational method of edge-network analysis shown in Figures 1 and
2; ﬁnally illustrate the prediction results as well as the comparison
between our edge-network and traditional node-network (i.e. molecular
network). Note that an edge in this article means a pair of two connecting
molecules.

2.1 Experimental data

The biological data GSE30550 (Huang et al., 2011) contains 17 subjects
(or adults) challenged with inﬂuenza H3N2/Wisconsin, for which, 9 sub-
jects are actually infected (with the clinical infection symptom), whereas 8
subjects stay healthy (without the clinical infection symptom) ﬁnally.
Gene expression proﬁles were obtained and measured on whole periph-
eral blood drawn from all subjects at an interval of 8 h post-inoculation
(hpi) through 108 hpi. Totally, 268 gene microarrays were obtained for all
subjects at 16 time points including baseline (24 h before subjects were
injected with inﬂuenza virus, e.g. —24 hpi) (Huang et al., 2011). Because
our method is designed for predicting the inﬂuenza infection, we only use
the predisease gene expression data (i.e. the time-course data before the
appearance of clinical symptom of inﬂuenza infection or the data shown
as Non-symptom in Fig. 2C) instead of the whole gene expression proﬁles
(i.e. the data before and after the symptom appearance). Because there is
no baseline information for subject-13, we did not take account of the
baseline data of any subject. As shown in Figure 2C, we chose the
predisease gene expression data for 17 subjects according to the clinical

index provided in original article (Huang et al., 2011). We divided sub-
jects into two groups according to the clinical symptom chart based on
the standardized symptom scoring (Dowling et al., 1958): symptomatic
(Sx) group with 9 subjects (subjects 1,5,6,7,8,10,12,13,15) and asymptom-
atic (Asx) group with 8 subjects (subjects 2,3,4,9,11,14,16,17).

(1) For symptomatic group, the lengths of used expression data for the
predisease periods are different due to the different clinical outcomes of
these pathogen subjects. For subjects 1, 5, 6 and 7, we all used the data
before 39h when they were diagnosed to have virus infection. Similarly,
for subjects 8, 10, 12, 13 and 15, the data obtained before 62, 74, 86, 98
and 98 h were used, respectively.

(2) For asymptomatic group, we used the data before 39 h, i.e. the ﬁrst
six time points without baseline point, although we can use more data.
This is because we expect to get the accurate prediction of inﬂuenza
infection by our method at the earliest time before a medical doctor
can give the clinical diagnostic results.

2.2 Theoretical basis of edge-network

A biological system at a molecular level can generally be described by
stochastic dynamics, which can be modeled by a master equation (Chen
et al., 2010; Van Kampen, 1992), i.e. Equation (1).

dP(x(t), z) _
dz _

where the system is composed of )1 molecular species x=(x1,. . . ,x,,) and
m reactions, and P(x,t) is the time evolution of the probability in state x
at time 1. Si]- is the change of x,- by the reaction-j with Sj=(S1]-,. . . ,5”), and
W]- is the propensity function, which is the transition probability. Note
that x,- is the number of molecule-i. As shown in Figure 1, with the lin-
earization and Gaussian distribution assumption of Equation (1), the
biological system can be exactly expressed by two sets of equations
(Ichikawa et al., 2009), i.e. Equation (2) for the mean vector of molecules
(or the ﬁrst-order statistics information) and Equation (3) for the covari-
ance matrix of molecules (or the second-order statistics information)
(Ichikawa et al., 2009).

Edge —networkdynam1cs : dt = A(t)o(t) + o(t)A (t) + D(t) (3)

where p. is the mean vector of x, and o is an n X n covariance matrix of x.
Clearly, Equation (2) is linear differential equations and represents the
traditional molecular network (e.g. gene network or protein interaction
network) or so-called node-network, where A is the network connection
matrix or adjacent matrix and a node is a molecule (i.e. 11,-), which is
based only on ﬁrst-order statistics information. A’ is the transpose of A.
On the other hand, Equation (3) is the Lyapunov differential equations,
which are based on the second-order statistics information. It constructs
the covariance network or edge-network, where a node is a pair of mol-
ecules (i.e. oij) in contrast to a molecule in a node-network, and a link in
an edge-network describes the relationships between two molecule pairs
in contrast to two molecules in a node-network. Clearly, Equations (2
and 3) can fully recover the stochastic dynamics of the biological system
with an appropriate assumption (Ichikawa et al., 2009). For instance, by
simulating Equations (2 and 3), we can obtain stochastic dynamics of
the original biological system Equation (1). Also Equations (2 and 3)
are independent of each other in the form, i.e. node-network and edge-
network can be analyzed separately. Although the adjacent matrix of the
edge-network can be obtained by using the elements of A shown in
Equation (3), it can be also numerically inferred by the covariance
matrix introduced in Equation (5) belows.

A node-network (traditional molecular network with node [M or x,) or
adjacent matrix A in Equation (2) is generally inferred by analyzing the

correlations of molecules based on expression data. On the other hand, in
theory, the edge-network (with node Ujj) can also be directly constructed
from high-throughput data based on its deﬁnition and correlations.
Speciﬁcally, the links of an edge-network could be approximately inferred
by using the corresponding correlations between molecule pairs.
Generally, a link in an edge-network is a fourth-order statistics (or the
fourth-order moment) due to its relationship between two molecule pairs.
The Pearson correlation coefﬁcient (PCC) is a second-order statistics,
which reﬂects the relationship between two molecules, i.e.

Cm x1) 2 E((x.- — 1),-xx) — #1))
(V91) V99) 7%. — 11.12on — 1112

 

 

PCC(x,-, Xj) = (4)

which is the basis of many methods to construct the traditional node-
network. On the other hand, for four molecules, i.e. two molecule pairs,
we deﬁne the similar measurement as follows:

C(xis xjs xk: x1)

\4/ V061) V09") V(Xk) V061)

_ E((X1 — #1)(Xj — #j)(xk — #j)(X1 — #1))
(715061 — #1)4E(Xj — #j)4E(Xk — #k)4E(X1 — #1)4

 

PCC(-xi9 xjs xk: x1) :

 

 

According to Isserlis’ theorem, we have

E((X1 — #1)(Xj — #j)(xk — #k)(x1 — #1))

= E((Xi — #1)(Xj — #1))E((Xk — #k)(X1 — #1))

1' E((X1 — #1)(Xk — #k))E((Xj — #j)(X1 — #1))

+ E((X1 — #1)(X1 — #1))E((Xj — #j)(xk — #k))

= C(X19XJ)C(st X1) + C(Xisxk)C(st X1) + C(X19X1)C(Xj, Xk)

Because of E(x,- — 11,-)4 = 3 V(x,-)2, then the fourth-order correlation coef-
ﬁcient is

PCC(x,-, xj, xk, x1)
: C(Xi, Xj)C(Xk, X1) + C(Xz', Xk)C(st X1) + C(Xz', X1)C(Xj, Xk) (5)
\3/ V061) V09) V(Xk) V061)

where C(x,, Xj) = E((x, — 11,-)(xj — 11.1)) and V(x,-) = E(x, — 11,)2. Clearly,
we can calculate the correlation between two molecule pairs i.e. x,— x]-
and xk — x, from biological data based on the aforementioned Equation
(5) provided that there are time-course data or multisample data, and
then, we can construct the network of molecule pairs, e.g. edge-network,
by Equation (5).

 

2.3 Computational algorithm of edge-network analysis

Based on the aforementioned theoretical basis, we carried edge-network
analysis on the biological data GSE30550 downloaded from NCBI GEO.
To predict live inﬂuenza infection, the edge-network analysis includes
several steps as below.

(0) In the preprocess of original data, we choose 1188 and 2909 genes,
respectively, for two groups of subjects (or individuals) by using fold
change selection (1.2 for asymptomatic and 1.3 for symptomatic in this
study). In details, for each subject, his/her differentially expressed genes
(DEGs) include those genes selected at different time points, and the
DEGs at a given time point are genes whose expression fold change
(the ratio between expressions at this time and the ﬁrst time) larger
than the aforementioned threshold. Then, the DEGs of subjects from
the same group (Sx or Asx) are united together. Note that, these thresh-
olds are determined by the change of gene number with the fold-change
value (Supplementary Fig. S1A and B), so that genes are chosen as many
as possible before the number of genes exceeds an half of all genes.

(1) Now, we use FCC to construct co-expression networks (a form of
node-network) for 9 Sx subjects, respectively. The correlations of any
gene pair (i.e. edge in node-network, or correlation of any two genes)
are different in nine networks and they form a nine dimension vector by

Equation (4). If the absolute mean value of such correlation vector is >08
and its standard deviation value <0.1 (Supplementary Fig. S1C), we select
this gene pair. When this threshold is >0.1, the number of the selected
edges increases rapidly, and thus we determine these standard deviation
thresholds by the effect of edge ﬁltering (Supplementary Fig. S1C). In
such a way, we ensure that the selected gene pairs/edges are consistently
signiﬁcant in nine networks, and they will be used to construct the edge-
network in following steps. Different from a general node-network, these
pro-selected edges will be the background ‘nodes’ of the ﬁnal edge-
networks. In other words, we actually choose the edges/gene pairs with
high correlations in all nine networks as the candidates of biomarkers,
which represent the common correlated gene associations among 9 Sx
subjects.

(2) Next, for each Sx subject, we carry out the fourth-order correlation
coefﬁcient estimation for each edge pair (i.e. a pair of gene pairs) by
Equation (5). The threshold of absolute value of such correlation is set
as 0.97 (Supplementary Fig. S1D) to choose the meaningful association
between two edges (i.e. four molecules). The rule for this threshold selec-
tion is based on the ratio between number of the selected gene pairs and
number of all possible gene pairs (i.e. complete graph) under the same
number genes (Supplementary Fig. S1D), which is on purpose to keep the
scarcity of associations among genes. Note that, during this step, we only
compute the correlations between preselected edges from aforementioned
step; i.e. we just consider the edges/gene pairs that are consistently sig-
niﬁcant in the original node-networks. In such a manner, we can reduce
the computation time and memory space drastically. Then, we will get
nine edge-networks for Sx subjects correspondingly, and those edges
(i.e. molecule pairs) presenting in at least seven Sx edge-networks are
thought to be closely related to disease development as the edge-
biomarkers of Sx group.

(3) As the same as the construction method of edge-networks for 9 Sx
subjects, we can also build edge-networks for 8 Asx subjects, respectively.
The thresholds used to construct Asx edge-networks are the same as
above values used in the construction of Sx edge-networks. Finally, the
edge-biomarkers of Asx group as the selected common edges are in at
least 5 Asx edge-networks, i.e. from more than a half of the Asx subjects
due to the indistinctive common edges in Asx group.

(4) Actually, we can use the differential gene pairs of two groups
(i.e. differential edge relations in Sx subjects and Asx subjects) as novel
edge-biomarkers to distinguish symptomatic (Sx) and asymptomatic
(Asx) groups with inﬂuenza infection. For example, the correlation
values of edges in these edge-biomarkers by Equation (4) can be used
for hierarchical clustering. To compare the contribution of these edge-
biomarkers from differential analysis, we also examine the edge-
biomarkers induced from two groups (Sx and Asx), respectively.

(5) Furthermore, a criterion Equation (6) based on DNB is used to
indicate a sudden deterioration before the disease. This composite criter-
ion for DNB in the predisease state is deﬁned by combining three con-
ditions (Chen et al., 2012; Liu et al., 2012; 2013b):

__ sod - PCCd

I
C PCCo

(6)
where PCCd is the average PCC of the expressions of genes in the dom-
inant group or DNB (e.g. a group of marker genes) in absolute value;
PCCo is the average PCC between the expressions of the dominant group
genes and other genes in absolute value; and SDd is the average standard
deviation of the expressions of the dominant group genes (Chen et al.,
2012; Liu et al., 2012, 2013b). This criterion can also be applied to quan-
tify our edge-biomarkers and used to reﬂect molecular network rewiring
before disease occurrence. Actually, from the biological viewpoint, the
selected edge-biomarkers can be used to predict inﬂuenza infection. This
is because there is also a critical transition from virus infection to disease,
which can be indicated by the DNB score of edge-biomarkers. In this

from Sx group (22 genes related to disease) and others (not in dominant
group) are the genes for studying Sx and Asx, respectively, i.e. the union
of 1188 and 2909 genes. To calculate such a criterion, we predeﬁne the
time window for expression correlation calculation. The window length is
ﬁve time points, i.e. he DNB score including expression data during any
consecutive ﬁve time points. Thus, each Sx or Asx subject has 11 time
windows and the corresponding DNB scores to represent his/her diag-
nostic score over time. When DNB score becomes signiﬁcantly larger
than a given prediction threshold, this time window will be regarded as
the early warning point/period of the disease. By using DNB score quan-
tifying edge-biomarkers to predict inﬂuenza infection in practice, the
Receiver-Operating Characteristic curve (ROC) can be drawn along
with the change of the prediction threshold from 0 to 3 with interval
as 0.01, and the corresponding Area Under ROC Curve (AUC) should
be used to evaluate the accuracy of such prediction.

(6) Finally, to conﬁrm the robustness of our edge-biomarkers and
avoid overﬁtting, the LOOCV is applied for Sx subjects (our discrimina-
tive edge-biomarkers are ﬁnally selected not from Asx subjects but from
Sx subjects, so that, LOOCV only removes Sx subjects one by one). In
detail, we rerun above edge-network analysis nine times. In each time, an
Sx subject is kept and other eight subjects are used to infer the edge-
network biomarkers. Then these biomarkers are used to predict that the
remaining Sx subject and other Asx subjects. After nine times, all the
prediction results based on the threshold change of edge-biomarkers are
summarized to draw ROC and calculate AUC.

Therefore, by implementing the aforementioned algorithm, we actually
have following conclusions: (i) for each Sx subject, the early warning
signal of the symptom was found before clinical diagnosis; (ii) for each
Sx subject, the critical time point was detected; and (iii) the edge-
biomarkers are signiﬁcantly related to the disease progression and
development (e.g. virus infection).

3 RESULTS

Although there already have many elegant experiments of the
study of host response to invading pathogens (Fenner et al.,
2006; Ichinohe et al., 2009; Proud et al., 2008; Ryo et al., 2008;
Zhu et al., 2008), how to predict the outcome of the inﬂuenza
infection from the observed data before the appearance of dis-
ease symptom and what are the key molecules to result in the
transition from a healthy state to a disease state still remain un-
clear. Thus, we carried edge-network analysis on the biological
data GSE30550 downloaded from NCBI GEO, which tried to
predict live inﬂuenza infection.

3.1 Edge-networks from non-symptom or predisease
expression data can distinguish inﬂuenza symptomatic
(Sx) and asymptomatic (Asx) subjects

(1) The gene composition in different edge-biomarkers. Figure 2C
shows the time-course gene expression proﬁles and clinical data
of 17 healthy adults within live inﬂuenza experiment (Huang
et al., 2011), for which 8 adults have non-symptom, i.e. asymp-
tomatic (Asx) during whole period, whereas 9 adults have the
symptom, i.e. symptomatic (Sx) after the virus infection but at
different time points. By analyzing these expression proﬁles
(Huang et al., 2011), we constructed the corresponding 17
edge-networks based on the computational algorithm of edge-
network analysis (see Section 2), and further identiﬁed
edge-biomarkers as well as the DNB scores during infection of
inﬂuenza A. Speciﬁcally, these two groups of edge-networks
were constructed from the non-symptom (i.e. predisease state

before the infection symptom appears) gene expression data cor-
responding to 9 symptomatic (Sx) and 8 asymptomatic (Asx)
adults, respectively, and two sets of common genes (or gene
pairs) were further extracted from respective symptomatic and
asymptomatic edge-networks (Supplementary Tables S1 and S2).
Note that for the purpose of infection prediction, we only use the
data with non-symptom for Sx subjects and with non-symptom
period for Asx subjects in Figure 2C to identify the edge-
biomarkers. We have found 80 edges with 22 common genes
(IFI44, IFI44L, DDX58, GBPl, T DRD7, IFI35, IFIT2,
IFIT 1, IFIT3, MXl, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, LAP3, HERCS,
PLSCRl, EIF2AK2, IFIH1, SERPINGI, OASL, RSAD2 and
ISG15) appearing in many symptomatic edge-networks (corres-
ponding to nine symptomatic subjects), which are totally differ-
ent from 34 edges with 41 genes commonly observed in the eight
asymptomatic edge-networks. These results provide obvious evi-
dence that different networks or edges observed before the symp-
tom appearance lead to divergent disease outcomes after virus
infection, thereby implying that they can be used to predict the
disease outcomes.

(2) The biological function and disease relevance of edge-
biomarkers. We also analyzed the functional enrichment of 22
common genes for Sx (Supplementary Table S3). The enriched
pathways are consistent with our expectations. A total of 8 of 22
genes (DDX58, MXl, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, EIF2AK2, IFIH1
and RASD2) are observed in Inﬂuenza A pathway
(Supplementary Fig. S2), and 7 genes (DDX58, MXl, OAS1,
OAS2, OAS3, EIF2AK2 and IFIH1) are also in Measles path-
way, which possibly share the similar inﬂuence on interferon-
alpha signaling pathway as inﬂuenza infection. In addition,
another three signiﬁcantly enriched pathways include hepatitis
C with 6 genes (DDX58, IFIT1, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3 and
EIF2AK2), herpes simplex infection with 7 genes (DDX58,
IFIT 1, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, EIF2AK2 and IFIH1) and RIG-
I-like receptor signaling pathway with 3 genes (DDX58, IFIH1
and ISG15). Particularity, MXl [myxovirus (inﬂuenza virus) re-
sistance 1, interferon-inducible protein p78 (mouse)] is an im-
portant gene associated with inﬂuenza infection (Engelhardt
et al., 2004; Garber et al., 1991; Salomon et al., 2007) and it is
also relevant with infection of hepatitis C (Knapp et al., 2003).
Furthermore, other genes undiscovered in inﬂuenza A pathway
or other pathways are also tightly related to inﬂuenza according
to their reported roles in biological functions and pathogen
mechanisms. For example, IFI44, IFI44L, GBPl, IFI35,
IFIT2, IFIT3 and HERCS are all interferon-induced proteins.
It has been reported that ISG15 conjugation inhibits inﬂuenza A
virus gene expression and replication and targets on the viral
NSl protein in virus-infected cells (Hsiang et al., 2009; Zhao
et al., 2010). HERCS is found to attenuate inﬂuenza A virus
by catalyzing ISGylation of viral NSl protein (Tang et al.,
2010). In contrast, 41 genes obtained from Asx show nothing
signiﬁcant with the inﬂuenza in pathway enrichment analysis,
and they even did not contain well-known genes related to dis-
eases. Thus, the identiﬁed genes in edge-biomarkers are reason-
ably explained on the biological functions and networks
corresponding to the divergent outcomes of two different subject
groups. Note that, the edge-biomarkers indicate the new roles
(associations) of genes (which can be used for disease

classiﬁcation and prediction), although many genes are already
known as disease genes.

(3) The comparison of edge-biomarkers determined in predisease
stage and advanced-disease stage. To illustrate the gene and func-
tion differences between predisease and disease states during
inﬂuenza A infection, we also carried out the same analysis
by using the whole time-course gene expression data (see
Supplementary Information). And according the analyzed
result (see Supplementary Information), we still use the genes
involved in edge-biomarkers from Sx subjects and their DNB
score for early diagnosis or predicting inﬂuenza infection.

3.2 Common genes of edge-networks as edge-biomarkers
can accurately predict time and outcome of inﬂuenza
infection before the disease

(1) The prediction of inﬂuenza infection is not only to judge the
ﬁnal outcome of different subjects but also estimate the time when
the subsequent infection occurs. In aforementioned analysis, the
80 edge-biomarkers with 22 genes from Sx subjects can distin-
guish Sx and Asx groups well, especially when using the gene
expression data on all available time points. However, to use
these new biomarkers to predict inﬂuenza infection for early
diagnosis, a key question is if or not these biomarkers can predict
the phenotypes of disease candidates before the appearance of
their disease symptoms. Thus, different from traditional bio-
markers to distinguish disease and normal samples, we have
shown that common genes of edge-networks as edge-biomarkers
can (i) correctly predict the outcome of inﬂuenza infection
among healthy adults with live inﬂuenza (H3N2/Wisconsin)
before the disease and (ii) also predict the critical time with the
symptom of inﬂuenza infection, which can tell us if and when
disease will occur for a speciﬁc subject. Using the same criterion
as that in Chen et a]. (2012), i.e. Equation (6), we calculated the
DNB score in each time point (time window) during the disease
progression after inﬂuenza injection, as shown in Figure 3A.

outcome of virus infection. We used DNB score quantifying edge-
biomarker to predict the subsequent result after virus infecting

Fig. 3. Prediction of outcomes after inﬂuenza injection by edge-
biomarkers (or DNB scores). (A) The DNB scores of edge-biomarkers
for all subjects during the disease progression (22 genes from the Sx edge-
network) after the inﬂuenza injection. The grey curves are DNB scores
for Sx subjects and black ones for Asx subjects. The dotted line is a cutoff
for distinguishing two subject groups. Note that one time window is ﬁve
consecutive time points as indicted in Figure 2C, e. g. window-2 is the time
period of 5—36 h. (B) The ROC curve of prediction performance based on
DNB score by only using non-symptom data (i.e. data before the inﬂu-
enza infection symptom appears). Its AUC is about 0.93

on each subject (see Section 2) as shown in Figure 2B. For each
subject, if in any time window, its DNB score is larger than a
given prediction threshold, we consider that this subject is now in
a disease state and will become symptomatic. To study the
threshold robustness of biomarkers, we used AUC to evaluate
the total performance of prediction accuracy based on the DNB
score of the edge-biomarker. We obtained the impressive result
with 0.93 AUC (Fig. 3B) to classify Sx and Asx subjects. From
Figure 3A, clearly, the DNB scores drastically increase for Sx
after virus infection, but not for Asx (except the subject 16). That
means that our edge-biomarkers can detect the relevant critical
transitions during the progression of inﬂuenza infection. In par-
ticular, when a subject approaches the critical transition point
(i.e. the time just before the symptom appears), DNB score dras-
tically increases, thereby indicating the imminent inﬂuenza infec-
tion or symptom (Sx). Otherwise, for Asx, DNB score is always
small due to non-occurrence of critical transition after the inﬂu-
enza injection. Therefore, edge-biomarkers with the DNB scores
can correctly predict the outcome of inﬂuenza infection for each
individual.

(3) The accuracy of edge-biomarker on the prediction of
occurred time of effective virus infection. We investigated whether
edge-biomarker can reﬂect system state or network change
before the disease occurrence, and we show the DNB score of
the edge-biomarker for each Sx subject (Fig. 4) and each Asx
subject (Supplementary Fig. S4). According to the cutoff of
DNB score for judging the occurrence of the disease during the
progression of inﬂuenza infection, clearly we can correctly pre-
dict the symptom for each subject (star label in Fig. 4) before the
inﬂuenza infection was diagnosed with standardized symptom
scoring record (circular label in Fig. 4), except one case, i.e. sub-
ject 5, which we failed to predict the outcome earlier than the
clinical diagnosis but we still correctly predict the disease
outcome of this subject. Thus, edge-biomarker can effectively
predict the time of onset inﬂuenza infection.

(4) The robustness of edge-biomarkers evaluated by cross-valid-
ation. We also repeat edge-network analysis with LOOCV to
assess our edge-biomarkers with DNB scores and their predic-
tion accuracy. The results are inspiring because the marker genes
are signiﬁcantly stable and AUC of prediction achieves
0.90 (Supplementary Fig. S9A). In all edge-biomarkers obtained
in LOOCV, there are 17 genes (IFI44, IFI44L, GBPl, IFIT2,
IFIT 1, IFIT3, MXl, OAS1, OAS2, OAS3, LAP3, HERCS,
PLSCRl, SERPINGl, OASL, RSAD2 and ISG15) always
appear, which are all found in our 22-genes edge-biomarkers.
The total number of marker genes induced in LOOCV is 26,
i.e. there are only 4 new genes (LAMP3, RTP4, TNFAIP6,
TNFSF10) found during this cross-validation procedure. We
found that these four genes are selected as biomarkers only
when subject-5 is left out and TNFSF10 is in inﬂuenza A path-
way. This fact might indicate that there is signiﬁcant personal
speciﬁcity with subject-5 so that the DNB score cannot predict it
before disease occurs. Besides, we have calculated the F1 values
of LOOCV (Supplementary Fig. S9B), the maximum score is
0.62 when the range of prediction threshold on DNB score is
from 1.4 to 2.08.

3.3 Comparison between edge-biomarkers and
node-biomarkers for predicting inﬂuenza infection

Different from previous biomarkers, we found that edge-
biomarkers extracted from the edge-network without normal
(Asx subjects) samples still have the ability to predict the pheno-
types of diseases by exploiting the information of pathogen
dynamical expressions, which can not only identify the inﬂuenza
infection outcomes but also detect the actual infection time
points. To compare the effectiveness with the conventional
node-networks, we obtained node or molecular biomarkers by
using the well-known method ARACNE in the same way as our
method.

(1) For each subject in Sx group or Asx group, their gene
expressions are used to infer node-network by ARACNE dir-
ectly. The parameters in ARACNE are set to be their default
values, and the P—value for mutual information threshold is set as
0.0001. Then the edges appearing in at least 7 Sx node-networks
are selected, and their genes are used as node-biomarkers to
compare with our edge-biomarkers.

(2) Similarly, the molecules or genes of node-biomarkers from
Sx group belonging to the dominant group and others (non-
dominant group) are used to study Sx and Asx, respectively.
The time window for correlation calculation is predeﬁned and
the window length is ﬁve time points, which are all the same as
our aforementioned DNB score evaluation in edge-biomarker
analysis.

The identiﬁed marker genes based on ARACNE have 474
much more than 22 genes, which also include some in our
edge-biomarkers. This fact shows that the conventional node-
network would be hard to narrow down the ranked genes
with pathogen relevance (or has higher false positive) due to
the lack of the information for collective effects of molecules.
Furthermore, these node-biomarkers show signiﬁcantly less pre-
diction power (AUC=0.67) than our edge-biomarkers (see
Supplementary Fig. S5) when they both use DNB score as a
predictor of inﬂuenza infection. In fact, although ARACNE is

an effective approach to reconstruct a gene regulatory network,
it does not consider the dynamical and high-order statistical in-
formation in temporal expression data related to disease devel-
opment. Thus, the genes in node-network from ARACNE
may lack the ability on distinguishing predisease samples. This
comparison validates the effectiveness of edge-biomarkers for
early diagnosis of diseases.

In addition, we have also compared edge-biomarkers with
traditional gene markers selected by student’s t—test on the tem-
poral gene expression data before the sixth time point. The se-
lected genes are signiﬁcantly differentially expressed from the
control time point, i.e. the ﬁrst time, for the Sx and Asx subjects,
respectively (P< 0.01). There are 439 genes that are only signiﬁ-
cantly differentially expressed in Sx subjects. The hierarchical
clustering of these genes shown in Supplementary Figure S6
illustrates no obvious expression patterns between Sx and Asx
subjects. Furthermore, the DNB scores based on this gene group
give a similar prediction performance (AUC=0.64) as that of
ARACNE (see Supplementary Fig. S7), which demonstrates
again the superiority of edge-biomarkers on predicting inﬂuenza
infection.

4 DISCUSSION

In contrast to conventional node-network focusing on associ-
ation between nodes (e.g. genes), however, our edge-network
aims at association between node-pairs (e.g. pairs of protein
interactions). With appropriate assumptions, we can show that
a biological system at a molecular level can be exactly modeled
by the equations with ﬁrst-order and second-order statistics,
where the ﬁrst-order equations correspond to the traditional mo-
lecular network or node-network, whereas the second-order
equations correspond to the covariance network or edge-
network. Node-network based on the average values of mo-
lecular concentrations is widely used to analyze the biological
behaviors at a speciﬁc condition, e.g. a normal state or a disease
state, but it cannot directly be applied to the analysis on the
critical state before the drastic transition due to the requirement
of the second-order statistics information. In contrast, as a com-
plementary part, edge-network is based on covariance informa-
tion among molecules, and thus it can be applied to predict the
critical transition of the system by identifying edge-biomarkers
from time-course (or stage-course) expression proﬁles. In this
article, we have studied the time-course data of 17 subjects
(healthy adults) with risk of inﬂuenza infection, and extracted
the common edge-biomarkers from edge-networks in two groups
of subjects with different clinical outcomes. The results show that
the edge-biomarkers derived from the edge-networks are able
to not only distinguish the Asx and Sx groups but also predict
the outcomes of the symptoms before the clinical diagnosis.
In this study, we only used one dataset to compare with
other method, and thus the validation of this work seems insuf-
ﬁcient. But with the accumulation of temporal expression data,
we will implement more elaborate experiments to evaluate the
effectiveness of our method. In addition, comparing with
the traditional node-network, the size of the edge-network is
much big and thus its analysis may be a computationally challen-
ging task.

Prediction and early diagnosis of complex diseases

 

Our edge-network analysis to predict inﬂuenza infection is
based on an assumption that subjects with same clinical out-
comes tend to have similar biological responses on a higher-
order network level after virus infection. This assumption ensures
that our model is consistent with the actual clinical diagnosis. We
constructed the edge-network for each adult based on the gene
expression proﬁle before the appearance of inﬂuenza symptom,
and validated the prediction ability of edge-biomarkers quanti-
ﬁed by DNB score (Chen et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2012, 2013a).
The analysis results support that high-order statistics and dynam-
ical information of biological data will be effective for mining
pathogen genes closely related to disease occurrence and devel-
opment even without normal control. Note that each edge-net-
work is constructed not by different individuals but by the same
person or species, and in contrast, traditional node-network and
node-biomarkers are identiﬁed from groups of different individ-
uals. Edge-network is also signiﬁcantly different from the existing
network-based methods and biomarkers (Liu et al, 2013a, b)
including DNB, which are still based on node-network.

From practical perspective, our method is attractive because it
provides a powerful tool for disease prediction, which is crucial
for the early treatment and prevention of the patients. The edge-
network analysis does not depend on the speciﬁc details of a
disease, and therefore it can be used to analyze other types of
diseases for prevention, early diagnosis and treatment. The pro-
posed method is a general way to represent a stochastic dynam-
ical system, and thus in addition to disease progression, the
proposed method can be used to study other biological processes
in a similar manner. By combining with traditional methods such
as Bayesian inference method, we may directly consider or char-
acterize the stochastic dynamics of the system to detect effective
edge-biomarkers. Also it is necessary to consider imprecise
phenotype factors so as to achieve accurate diagnosis on complex
diseases.

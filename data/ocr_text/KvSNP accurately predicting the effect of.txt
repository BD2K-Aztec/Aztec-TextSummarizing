ABSTRACT

Motivation: Non-synonymous single nucleotide polymorphisms
(nsSNPs) in voltage-gated potassium (Kv) channels cause diseases
with potentially fatal consequences in seemingly healthy individuals.
Identifying disease-causing genetic variation will aid presymptomatic
diagnosis and treatment of such disorders. NsSNP-effect predictors
are hypothesized to perform best when developed for specific
gene families. We, thus, created KvSNP: a method that assigns a
disease-causing probability to Kv-channel nsSNPs.

Results: KvSNP outperforms popular non gene-family-specific
methods (SNPs&GO, SIFT and Polyphen) in predicting the disease
potential of Kv-channel variants, according to all tested metrics
(accuracy, Matthews correlation coefficient and area under receiver
operator characteristic curve). Most significantly, it increases the
separation of the median predicted disease probabilities between
benign and disease-causing SNPs by 26% on the next-best
competitor. KvSNP has ranked 172 uncharacterized Kv-channel
nsSNPs by disease-causing probability.

1 INTRODUCTION

One in every 300 bases of human DNA shows variation
between individuals. These sites are called single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs; The International HapMap Consortium,
2003). Distinguishing benign SNPs (bSNPs) from those that cause
disease (chNPs) is a key premise for personalized medicine, but
with a total of 10 million polymorphic loci within the genome it
is no trivial feat. Efforts are often focused on identifying SNPs
responsible for speciﬁc diseases (Kapa et al., 2009), or all chNPs
within certain genomic regions (The ENCODE Consortium, 2007)
or genes (Splawski et al., 2000); for example, identifying chNPs
within the voltage—gated potassium (KV) channel genes, where
genetic variation has been shown to cause, or be associated with,

cardiac arrhythmogenesis, for which the ﬁrst presenting symptom
can be sudden cardiac death. Genetic screening of a Long QT
Syndrome (LQTS) cohort of 262 patients revealed that 59% had
at least 1 minor allele in a KV—channel gene (Splawski et al., 2000).
An additional concern with arrhythmogenesis is that individuals
with certain genetic backgrounds (including KV—channel genotypes)
can acquire it when administered with certain drugs (Anantharam
et al., 2003). Furthermore, SNPs in KV—channel genes also cause, or
predispose individuals to, various neurological disorders including
epilepsy (Kaneko et al., 2002), neuromyotonia (Poujois et al., 2006)
and episodic ataxia (Scheffer et al., 1998), as well as other diseases,
such as deafness (Kubisch et al., 1999). While not directly fatal,
these disorders would still beneﬁt from pre—symptomatic diagnosis
and treatment.

Association studies have previously been used to identify Kv—
channel chNPs (Kapa et al., 2009), but there is concern that some
variants may be incorrectly assigned because study cohorts were
not large enough to infer statistical signiﬁcance (Ackerman et al.,
2003; K'a‘ab and Schulze—Bahr, 2005). Results are also confounded
by multiple testing errors, and the fact that compound SNPs are
likely to cause, or contribute to, disease (Brookes, 1999). Variable
phenotype penetrance and severity is observed in arrhythmia
patients harboring the same KV—channel SNP (Scicluna et al.,
2008), suggesting that phenotypic modiﬁer genes and/or variants
exist (Schwartz et al., 2003). Ranking SNPs by disease—causing
probability would (i) prioritize variants for further examination and
(ii) aid identiﬁcation of phenotype—modifying variants. This is made
even more relevant by the current sequencing revolution, where
advances in high—throughput technology have facilitated genotyping
to an unprecedented depth at affordable costs; resulting in a plethora
of data that some are ﬁnding hard to analyse fast enough (Editorial,
2008).

Computational methods to predict whether nsSNPs will cause
disease were originally based on empirical rules (Ng and Henikoff,
2001; Ramensky et al., 2002) but now tend to use machine learning
approaches (Calabrese et al., 2009; Jiang et al., 2007; Krishnan
and Westhead, 2003; Yue and Moult, 2006). Variants of known
consequence are used to train the machine learning predictor, which
ﬁnds patterns within the annotated nsSNP attributes that best classify
the data into in their constituent groups: chNPs and bSNPs. Once
trained, the predictor can be applied to uncharacterized variants,
emitting the likelihood that they are disease causing. This approach
has resulted in prediction accuracies of up to 82% (Calabrese
et al., 2009), but there is some evidence that performance can be
improved if the machine learning model is built for a speciﬁc gene

family. This is hypothesized to be due to the gene family speciﬁc
weighting of variant attributes within the model, and the ability to
include attributes that are biologically relevant to those genes and/or
protein products (Torkamani and Schork, 2007). To test this, we
built an nsSNP prediction method speciﬁcally for Kv—channel genes,
KvSNP, and optimized it with respect to the learning features and
machine learning method. KvSNP outperforms the leading genome—
wide SNP effect prediction method with increased separation of
bSNPs and chNPs in probability space. The latter is particularly
pertinent as the trust placed in the accuracy of disease annotation in
training datasets for SNP—effect predictors is a point of concern (Care
at 611., 2007), especially for complex diseases where multiple SNPs
are expected to contribute to disease phenotype, thus confounding,
or removing, the ability to classify individual variants as disease
causing or benign (Ackerman 61611., 2003).

Genetic characterization of Kv—channels will aid presymptomatic
diagnosis and treatment of diseases such as cardiac arrhythmia. To
this end, we have used KvSNP to predict the disease—causing ability
of 172 uncharacterized nsSNPs and present case studies regarding
those predictions.

2 METHODS
2.1 The Dataset

Data on characterized nsSNPs were collated from Uniprot 13 (The
UniProt Consortium, 2009), the Human Gene Mutation Database: HGMD
Professional 2009.2 (Stenson et 611., 2009), MutDB (Singh et 611., 2008) and
manual extraction from research papers (Supplementary Table S 1). A chNP
annotation (irrespective of the disease) was assigned if concluded by (i) the
genotype—phenotype database curators and/or (ii) the authors of the research
papers. Conﬂicting annotations were resolved by assigning that given by
the largest and most statistically robust study. Truncation mutations were
not included as all were annotated as disease causing, hence the machine
learning method would be unable to learn from them. This resulted in
1009 chNPs and 113 bSNPs. To increase the number of bSNPs, we added
to them by identifying single nucleotide differences between human and
homologous mammalian Kv genes (>90% sequence identity) that result in
a change in protein sequence, the assumption being that ﬁxed evolutionary
changes are neutral. Such ‘divergent’ datasets have been used in similar
ways previously (Care et 611., 2007; Sunyaev et 611., 2001; Yue and Moult,
2006) and independent Kv—channel research into disease susceptibility has
shown that a human nsSNP that is present in a homologue is unlikely to be
disease causing (Jackson and Accili, 2008). Our ﬁnal dataset consisted of
1009 chNPs and 782 bSNPs, of which 100 chNPs and 76 bSNPs (~10%)
were removed to form a blind test dataset. This data removal was performed at
random but multiple variant protein products resulting from a single genetic
variation (owing to alternative splicing) were ﬁltered to ensure they were
wholly contained in either the training or test data. The remaining training
dataset consisted of 706 bSNPs and 909 chNPs.

2.2 Learning features

A total of 14 nsSNP attributes were used as learning features; summarized
in Table 1. The wild—type and mutant residue identity are included as a basic
descriptor of the nsSNP. Evolutionary conservation of the variant position
has been shown to be predictive (Care e1 611., 2007; Jiang et 611., 2006),
hence conservation scores were assigned using Rate4Site (Mayrose e1 611.,
2004), a top—performing method (Capra and Singh, 2007; Dukka Bahadur and
Livesay, 2008). Hidden Markov Model (HMM) sequence proﬁles, created
using HMMER (Eddy, 1998), were used to assign two additional features:
change in HMM score and change in HMM E —value, which quantify how an
nsSNP alters a sequence’s ﬁt to the modelled proﬁle (Clifford etal., 2004).

The label indicates the short hand used to refer to each feature in tables and ﬁgures
throughout this article.

Conservation scoring and HMM creation require multiple sequence
alignments (MSAs) which were created as we detailed previously (Stead
e1 611., 2010). The majority of Kv—channel LQTS—causing variants reside
within the transmembrane segments (Ackerman e1 611., 2003) and our
previous research has revealed signiﬁcant associations between disease—
causing probability and location of nsSNPs, and hence topological location
(Fig. 1) was included, assigned as per Stead etal. (2010).

Structure—based learning features can improve SNP—effect predictors
(Krishnan and Westhead, 2003), hence we built homology models in
Modeller (Sali and Blundell, 1993), using the only resolved high—resolution
Kv—channel structure (2R9R: Long etal., 2007) and predict how each nsSNP
changes stability and solvent accessibility using POPMuSiC2.0, which is both
fast and accurate (Dehouck et 611., 2009).

Changes in physiochemical property at the variant locus may also
disrupt to local interactions, hence changes in mass, hydrophobicity and
isoelectric point were extracted from Biro (2006). Secondary structure and
solvent accessibility were also predicted from sequence alone, using SABLE
(Adamczak etal., 2005), a popular programme for protein structure analysis
(Gromiha e1 611., 2010). Subfamily membership was included owing to its
predictive power when included in a kinase—speciﬁc SNP effect prediction
method (Torkamani and Schork, 2007).

2.3 The machine learning method

Several machine learning methods were tested and implemented in the Weka
(Hall at 611., 2009):

0 Fast Random Forest (FRF), an implementation of the random forest,
RF (Breiman, 2001), classiﬁer that uses the REPTree algorithm for
decision trees (DTs);

0 J48, a DT based on the C45 (Quinlan, 1993) that uses information gain
for feature selection at each node, and prunes using subtree raising;

0 a support vector machine (SVM) that uses sequential minimal
optimization;
0 a naive Bayes classiﬁer (John and Langley, 1995); and

0 an artiﬁcial neural network (ANN). A multilayer perceptron was used
with sigmoidal transfer function.

Each machine learning methods assigns queries with a disease—causing
probability [p(chNP)]. DTs do this based on the weighting of classes at
each terminal node while RFs amalgamate the results from all constituent
DTs. The SVM assigns probabilities using logistic regression, and the naive
Bayes classiﬁer results are based on class frequencies in the training set. The
results from the ANN are based on the weighted output of ﬂow across the
network with a sigmoidal transfer function applied. A nsSNP is classiﬁed as
a chNP if P 2 0.5 for all these methods.

2.4 Performance metrics

Ten—fold, stratiﬁed, cross—validation (CV) was used to assess the performance
of each machine learning method, revealing counts of true positives (TPs),
true negatives (TNs), false positives (FPs) and false negatives (FNs). We
used these counts to ascertain accuracy [Equation (1)], Matthews correlation
coefﬁcient [MCC: Equation (2)] and area under the receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curve (AUC) for each method.

3 IMPLEMENTATION: KvSNP

3.1 Comparison with other methods

The blind test data (which was not used in the CV above) was used to
assess KvSNP’s performance and compare it with that of the existing
genome—wide nsSNP—effect predictors:

0 SNPs&GO: an SVM—based method that includes gene ontology
(GO) annotations in its learning features (Calabrese at 611.,
2009);

- Sorting intolerant from tolerant (SIFT): predictions based on
conservation scores from MSAs (Ng and Henikoff, 2003).

- PolyPhen (polymorphism phenotyping): predictions made
using empirical rules (Ramensky 61611., 2002).

Results were either attained from web servers (SNPs&GO and
PolyPhen) or using locally downloaded copies of the software
(SIFT). The blind test data may have been used in training existing
methods, but this possible advantage to their performance cannot be
avoided easily. To allow signiﬁcance testing and error estimation,
the blind test data were randomly split into 10 stratiﬁed folds and
metrics were calculated for each fold before being averaged.

3.2 Making predictions on uncharacterized nsSNPs

Whilst sourcing our dataset, we also collated information on 172
Kv—channel nsSNPs for which an effect is unknown, using dbSNP
129 (Sherry 61611., 2001) as an additional resource. We predicted the
effect of these using the KvSNP server.

4 RESULTS

4.1 A set of 5 learning features performs best

To determine which learning features to use in our method, we
applied a best—ﬁrst search algorithm (Pearl, 1984) where each
feature is evaluated and the best, based on correlation—based feature
selection (Hall, 2000), is expanded upon to form the next ‘node’
in the search. This process resulted in ﬁve learning features:
conservation score (cons), change in hydrophobicity (thob),
change in structural stability (dE), change in HMM score (HMM)
and subfamily membership (subfam).

4.2 The FRF classiﬁer works best

We optimized the parameters for each machine learning classiﬁer,
using the training data and set of ﬁve best learning features, by
testing a range of values and selecting those combinations at which
the model attained maximum MCC and accuracy (data not shown).
This resulted in:

0 a DT with a pruning conﬁdence threshold of 0.27, minimum of
1 instance per leaf and that output leaf conditional probabilities
with no Laplace smoothing;

- an FRF created from 14 DTs with 3 features selected per node;

0 a polynomial—kernel SVM with soft margin constant of 3 and
class probability estimates equated using logistic regression;

0 a naive Bayes classiﬁer that modeled continuous variables
using supervised discretization; and

0 an ANN with a learning rate of 0.1 and momentum of 0.2.

Performance metrics for the optimized classiﬁers are given in
Figure 2 and Table 2. All were normally distributed (Shapiro—Wilk:
P > 0.5). The t—tests showed that FRF had a signiﬁcantly increased
AUC compared with all other methods, and a signiﬁcantly increased
MCC and accuracy compared with all other methods except DT
(P < 0.05). We, thus, chose FRF as the machine learning method to
creating KvSNP.

4.3 KvSNP outperforms alternative methods

KvSNP was then compared with several other genome—wide nsSNP—
effect predictors using the blind test data. The metrics were
normally distributed (Shapiro—Wilk test: P >0.05). Results (Fig. 3
and Table 3) show that, in comparison to the next—best performing
predictor, KvSNP has signiﬁcantly (t—test: P—values given below)
greater accuracy (0.87:I:0.03 versus 0.83:I:0.03:P=0.16), MCC
(0.70:l:0.05 versus 0.62:l:0.07:P=0.09) and AUC (0.92:I:0.02
versus 0.85:I:0.04:P=0.07).

To be effective, prediction methods should clearly distinguish
chNPs from bSNPs (Jiang at 611., 2007) by assigning signiﬁcantly
different disease—causing probabilities [p(chNP)]. The distributions
of p(chNP), per class, are plotted in Figure 4 and are signiﬁcantly
different for each method (t—test: P <0.05). However, Figure 4
clearly shows that KvSNP produces a signiﬁcantly greater (t—test:
P<0.05 except against SNP&GO where P=0.08) separation of

4.4 KvSNP predictions on uncharacterized nsSNPs

We applied KvSNP to the uncharacterized variants and ranked
the results in descending order of disease—causing probability
(Supplementary Table S2). An additional literature search, in an
attempt to verify our predictions, did not reveal that any of these
variants have been statistically classiﬁed since we collated our
dataset.

However, there were several ﬁndings worthy of note.

KCNQI H105L (NM_000218.2:C.381C>A): this was identiﬁed
in a single individual during a gene mutation screening of sudden
infant death syndrome (SIDS) victims (Wedekind e1 611., 2006).
SIDS has been linked to cardiac arrhythmia (Makielski, 2006).
Electrophysiological characterization did not reveal any alteration
in channel function in vitro, but KvSNP predicted this to be a disease
causing SNP with a probability [p(chNP)] of 1.0. We believe this
variant should be investigated further in vivo to ascertain if it should
be part of clinical genetic screening.

KCNA5 GI82R (NM_002234.2:6.544G>A) and EZIID
(NM_002234.2:C. 633G>C): both observed in heterozygous form
in patients (2 per variant) suffering idiopathic pulmonary arterial
hypertension (IPAH) (Remillard e1 611., 2007). The cohort numbers
used in this study are not sufﬁcient to statistically assign the
nsSNPs as disease causing, hence electrophysiological assays were
carried out. The assays revealed that G182R signiﬁcantly changes
certain channel properties (inactivation kinetics and protein levels)
with respect to wild—type, whereas E211D does not (Burg e1 611.,
2010). KvSNP predicts that KCNA5 G182R is disease causing
[p(chNP)=1.0], whereas E211D is not [p(chNP)=0]. G182R
should, thus, be investigated further in vivo.

KCNHZ A1116V (NM_000238.2.‘C.3347C>T): implicated as
a latent LQTS causal variant, benign unless KCNHZ K897T
(NM_000238.2:c.2690A>C) is also present (Crotti e1 611., 2005).
KvSNP assigns a p(chNP) of 0.26, highlighting the beneﬁt of
assigning a probability, as opposed to just a class; variants can
be ranked in the order of disease—causing susceptibility. KCNHZ
A1116V is predicted to be benign (0 §p(chNP) < 0.5) but variants
ranked highly among the bSNPs are hypothesized to be those most
likely to act as genetic modiﬁers. A1116V is in the top 25% of
the uncharacterized variants predicted to be benign (Supplementary
Table S2), which concurs with our hypothesis. We could not make an
unbiased prediction for KCNHZ K897T as this variant was included
in our training dataset.

5 DISCUSSION

Genetic characterization of Kv—channels is required to identify
SNPs that cause cardiac arrhythmia, a disease with potentially fatal
consequences for seemingly healthy individuals and other serious
diseases. We have created KvSNP: a machine learning classiﬁer
that is applied to Kv—channel nsSNPs to predict the likelihood that
the variant causes disease. Alternative types of mutation are also
known to cause disease in Kv—channels, and these are reported on
KvDB (Stead e1 611., 2010), but too few are characterized to facilitate
a machine learning approach for their predicted effect. We found
that ﬁve learning features optimized KvSNP’s performance. Two
of these (cons and HMM) are evolutionary descriptors, concurring
with previous ﬁndings that evolutionary metrics increase predictive
power (Care e1 611., 2007; Jiang et 611., 2006), and one is subfamily

membership, a feature also included upon creation of a speciﬁc
nsSNP—effect predictor for the kinase gene family (Torkamani and
Schork, 2007). This indicates that gene—family—speciﬁc features are
important in creating prediction methods, and their inclusion is
likely to be part of the reason that KvSNP outperformed alternative
genome—wide nsSNP—effect predictors. It should also be noted that
we could not verify whether the machine learning based generic
nsSNP—effect predictor, SNPs&GO, was trained using any of the
blind test data: a fact that would give it an advantage over our
method.

Misclassiﬁcation of SNPs in the training data, a concern with
complex disease phenotypes, creates noise in the training dataset,
making the machine learning task of discriminating and separating
the classes more difﬁcult. We show that KvSNP is best able
to separate bSNPs and chNPs in probability space, compared
with genome—wide predictors, indicating its robustness to noise
in the training data, and resulting in disease—causing probabilities
that are easier for users to interpret. Overall, this concurs with
the 2007 ﬁndings of Torkamani and Schork: that gene—family—
speciﬁc nsSNP—effect predictors are more accurate than genome—
wide methods, justifying their creation at a time when the number of
novel nsSNPs, in need of characterization, is set to rapidly increase.

6 CONCLUSION

KvSNP is better at discerning the outcome of Kv—channel nsSNPs
than genome—wide methods, and is able to discriminate between
classes of nsSNPs more effectively. The inclusion of evolutionary
descriptors in two of ﬁve learning features used highlights the
predictive power of such metrics. We have used KvSNP to make
predictions on, and thus rank 172 uncharacterized Kv—channel gene
nsSNPs to prioritize them for future genetic association studies

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biologistics provides data for quantitative analysis of
transport (diffusion) processes and their spatio-temporal correlations
in cells. Mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters necessary to
describe reaction rates for gene regulation. Although understanding of
diffusion-limited biochemical reactions in vivo requires mobility data
for the largest possible number of proteins in their native forms, cur-
rently, there is no database that would contain the complete informa-
tion about the diffusion coefficients (DCs) of proteins in a given cell
type.

Results: We demonstrate a method for the determination of in vivo
DCs for any molecule—regardless of its molecular weight, size and
structure—in any type of cell. We exemplify the method with the data-
base of in vivo DC for all proteins (4302 records) from the proteome of
K12 strain of Escherichia coli, together with examples of DC of amino
acids, sugars, RNA and DNA. The database follows from the
scale-dependent viscosity reference curve (stRC). Construction of
stRC for prokaryotic or eukaryotic cell requires ~20 in vivo meas-
urements using techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectro-
scopy (FCS), fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP),
nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) or particle tracking. The shape
of the stRC would be different for each organism, but the mathem-
atical form of the curve remains the same. The presented method has
a high predictive power, as the measurements of DCs of several inert,
properly chosen probes in a single cell type allows to determine the
DCs of thousands of proteins. Additionally, obtained mobility data
allow quantitative study of biochemical interactions in vivo.

1 INTRODUCTION

Biologistics and biochemistry in a crowded environment are two
emerging interdisciplinary ﬁelds of science. They provide quanti-
tative analysis of transport of proteins and their spatio-temporal
correlations involved in gene expression and regulation.
According to the current state-of-the-art theory of gene expres-
sion (activation or repression) in bacteria (Elf et al., 2007; Li
et al., 2009), mobility of proteins is one of the few parameters
necessary to describe reaction rates of gene regulation. The
mobility is understood as a three-dimensional diffusion or

one-dimensional sliding along DNA (for prokaryotes and eu-
karyotes), or by velocity of molecular motors (in eukaryotic
cells). Understanding of diffusion-limited biochemical reactions
requires accurate in vivo mobility data for the largest possible
number of proteins in their native forms. The three-dimensional
diffusion of different types of macromolecules in the cytoplasm
of Escherichia coli has been experimentally studied in several
cases (Bakshi et al., 2012; Campbell and Mullins, 2007;
Cluzel et al., 2000; Derman et al., 2008; Elowitz et al., 1999;
English et al., 2011; Golding and Cox, 2004; Jasnin et al., 2008;
Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2010;
Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al., 2010; Slade et al.,
2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007), but experimental determin-
ation of the mobility of all proteins is technically an impossible
task because of their large number in a given cell. For example,
the proteome of the K12 strain of E. coli (Blattner et al., 1997)
contains more than 4300 proteins. Moreover, most of the recent
studies concern measurements mainly performed with the use of
green ﬂuorescent protein (GF P) (Elowitz et al., 1999; Konopka
et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2010; Nenninger
et al., 2010; Slade et al., 2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007) or
GF P fusion proteins (Jennifer et al., 2001).

Attempts to study the diffusion of many proteins simultan-
eously, under conditions resembling the interior of the cells,
were performed in silico by McGuffee and Elcock (2010).
Computational methods, however, have limitations arising
from the speed and capacity of computing hardware and small
number of interacting proteins in the system (~50 different types
of proteins) (McGuffee and Elcock, 2010). An alternative ap-
proach is the quantitative analysis of available literature data.
Mika and Poolman (2011) gathered literature data of diffusion
coefﬁcients (DCs) of ~20 different types of proteins in E. coli
and proposed a power law dependence of the DC on the mo-
lecular weight of proteins. This power law, however (Mika and
Poolman, 2011), can be applied only for the proteins in a narrow
range of molecular weights, i.e. between 20 and 30 kDa.

In this work, we present a method for predictions of the DCs
of proteins for the proteome of any cell. We collected all
available literature data (Bakshi et al., 2012; Campbell and
Mullins, 2007; Cluzel et al., 2000; Derman et al., 2008; Elowitz
et al., 1999; English et al., 2011; Golding and Cox, 2004; Jasnin
et al., 2008; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010;
Mika et al., 2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al.,
2010; Slade et al., 2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007) on diffusion
of various probes, including small molecules (water, glucose),
proteins and plasmids, in the cytoplasm of E. coli. We used
those data and the scaling function of Viscosity (Holyst et al.,

dict the mobility of macromolecules in the bacterial cytoplasm.
We also predicted the DCs of amino acids, sugars, proteins and
DNA. We created a unique database, including the DCs of all
proteins of strain K12 of E. coli (4302 proteins), their oligomers
and their potential complexes with translocation proteins; 6600
records in total.

2 METHODS
2.1 A brief description of the method

Our predictions of DCs of proteins in the bacterial cytoplasm are based
on experimental data on diffusion in the cytoplasm of E. coli available in
the literature (Bakshi et al., 2012; Campbell and Mullins, 2007; Cluzel
et al., 2000; Derman et al., 2008; Elowitz et al., 1999; English at al., 2011;
Golding and Cox, 2004; J asnin et al., 2008; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar
et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al.,
2010; Slade et al., 2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007). The method relies
on the dependence Do/DcytO 2 11/110, where Do is the DC of macromol-
ecule in water of viscosity no, and Dcyto is the DC of macromolecule in the
cytoplasm. n is the effective viscosity experienced by the macromolecule
during diffusion in the cytoplasm. The protocol of determination of DCs
is graphically represented in Figure 1.

2.2 Calculation of hydrodynamic radii and DCs in water

Hydrodynamic radius of proteins was determined using the following
formula mill at al., 2011):

r, = 0.0515M3V-392 [nm], (1)
while for RNA we used Equation (2) (Werner, 2011).
r, = 0.0566103,38 [nm]. (2)

Fig. 1. Diagram of a method of predicting the DC of any molecule in
the cell cytoplasm. To predict the DCs of molecules in the cytoplasm,
it is essential to correctly select the probes that will be used to determine
the reference curve. Next, one need to measure the DCs of selected probes
in water (buffer) D0 and the DC in the cytoplasm of studied cell Dcyto.
Using Do and Dcyto, we create the stRC. To predict the DC of a given
molecule, it is necessary to know its hydrodynamic radius rp or Do.
Although stRC depends on both rp and Do, in practice, both param-
eters can be calculated knowing only one of them. Finally, by substituting
the values of rp and Do to stRC, the DC in the cytoplasm Dcyto can be
determined

 

 

Dependence of the hydrodynamic radii of linear, circular or super
coiled DNA on molecular weight [Equations (3)—(5), respectively] was
obtained from DCs of DNA constructs (Robertson et al., 2006) using
Equation (6).

r, = 0.0241143,” [nm], (3)
r, = 0.0125M3V-59 [nm], (4)
r, = 0.0145Mgv-57 [nm]. (5)

Radii of amino acids and sugars have been calculated, assuming that the
hydrodynamic radius rp corresponds to the van der Waals radius rW
calculated according to the procedure described elsewhere (Zhao et al.,
2003).

For each probe, we use the literature values of Dcyto, while the values
of Do (if not available) were calculated using the Stokes—Sutherland—
Einstein equation [Equation (6)].

2.3 Calculation of DCs of various molecules in the
cytoplasm of E. coli

Using the molecular weights from Uniprot protein database (preiler
et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2009), we calculated the DCs for the complete
proteome of E. coli (K12 strain). We identiﬁed the cellular localization of
each protein as well as its quaternary structure (a single polypeptide chain
or multiple chain aggregates or complexes). In the case of membrane or
periplasmic proteins, we adopted the assumption that, after synthesis, the
proteins diffuse via the cytoplasm to its target in the membrane, through
one of two transport pathways [twin-arginine translocation (TAT) or the
general secretion system (Sec)] (Driessen and Nouwen, 2008; Sargent,
2007). Consequently, these proteins were considered as single polypeptide
chains (the TAT pathway) or protein complexes with SecB or Tig pro-
teins (the Sec pathway). Hydrodynamic radius of proteins was deter-
mined using Equation (1). When the protein was composed of several
subunits, the molecular weight of all polypeptide chains comprising the
protein was added together. On the basis of cumulative molecular weight
of the complex, hydrodynamic radius of the protein rp and further its DC
D0 was calculated [Equations (1) and (6)]. Then, using Equation (7), we
calculated the relative DCs for all analysed proteins, and we calculated
the DCs of proteins in the cytoplasm Dam. The calculated DCs of all
proteins in the cytoplasm are summarized in Supplementary Table S1.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Construction of the scale-dependent viscosity reference
curve

We collected the literature data (Bakshi et al., 2012; Campbell
and Mullins, 2007; Cluzel et al., 2000; Elowitz et al., 1999;
English et al., 2011; Golding and Cox, 2004; Jasnin et al.,
2008; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010; Mika et al.,
2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al., 2010; Slade
et al., 2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007) for DCs of different
solutes and macromolecules in the cytoplasm of E. coli (Fig. 2
and Table 1). We used the least squares method to ﬁt those data
with Equation (7) (Kalwarczyk et al., 2011).

of water no [ln(n/no) = ln(Do/Dcyto)] as a function of the hydrodynamic
radius rp of various probes (Table 1) of radii from 0.16 nm to 203nm
(closed square). The cytoplasmic DCs Dcyto of probes were taken from
the literature (Bakshi et al., 2012; Campbell and Mullins, 2007; Cluzel
et al., 2000; Elowitz et al., 1999; English at al., 2011; Golding and Cox,
2004; Jasnin et al., 2008; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar et al., 2010; Mika
et al., 2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al., 2010; Slade et al.,
2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007) (cf. Table 1). By ﬁtting the data with
Equation (7) (solid line), we determined two length scales:
5 = 0.51 :l: 0.09 nm and Rh 2 42 :l: 9 nm. We also determined the macro-
scopic viscosity of the cytoplasm nm 2 17.5Pa - s, i.e. 26 000 times higher
than the viscosity of water no at 310 K. Shading represents the maximum
error of ﬁtting

here rp is the hydrodynamic radius of the probe, and Rh and S
are length scales characterizing the cytoplasm. 5 (an average dis-
tance between surfaces of proteins), Rh (average hydrodynamic
radius of the biggest crowders) and a (a constant of the order of
one) are the ﬁtting parameters whose values for the cytoplasm of
E. coli are as follows: 5: 0.51 :l: 0.09 nm, Rh 2 42 :l: 9nm and
a = 0.53 :l: 0.04. From the scale-dependent viscosity reference
curve (stRC), we directly determined the macroscopic viscosity
nm of the cytoplasm. We found that 17m = 17.5 Pa - s (26 000
times greater than the viscosity of water — no % 0.7 mPa - s at
310 K). Rh is comparable to the radius of the loops (Kim et al.,
2004) of DNA covered with proteins. The second length scale
determined from stRC, 5, is comparable to the average dis-
tance between surfaces of proteins. Rh determines the length
scale above which the viscosity ceases to depend on the size of
the probe and reaches the macroscopic value. For a probe smal-
ler than S, the experienced viscosity has a value comparable to
the viscosity of water.

We used as-obtained stRC [Equation (7)] as a tool for
prediction of DCs of all known proteins of K12 strain
(Blattner et al., 1997) of E. coli as well as other molecules and
macromolecules.

3.2 Interpretation of stRC

For more than a decade, diffusion of various proteins in the
cytoplasm of E. coli has been studied (Table 1) (Bakshi et al.,
2012; Campbell and Mullins, 2007; Cluzel et al., 2000;
Elowitz et al., 1999; English et al., 2011; Golding and Cox,

2004; Jasnin et al., 2008; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar et al.,
2010; Mika et al., 2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al.,
2010; Slade et al., 2009; van den Bogaart et al., 2007). Those
experimental data show that the DCs exponentially depend on
the size of the diffusing molecule. For example, GFP with a
molecular weight MW 2 27 kDa and hydrodynamic radius
rp = 2.8 nm is characterized by cytoplasmic DC (Elowitz et al.,
1999) Dcyto = 7.7 :l: 2.5 ,u.m2/s. On the other hand, the DC of
large oligomeric protein consisting of four subunits of
GFP-tagged ,B-galactosidase (,B-gal-GFP)4, of radius almost
three times greater than GFP (MW % 580 kDa, rp = 7.3 nm), is
equal to 0.7 :l: 0.22,u.m2/s (Mika et al., 2010). The above differ-
ences are explained in terms of scale-dependent viscosity
(Kalwarczyk et al., 2011) experienced by the diffusing molecule
[of stRC, Equation (7)]. Equation (7) is an empirical equation
primarily found for synthetic systems such as polymer or micellar
solutions (Holyst et al., 2009; Kalwarczyk et al., 2011; Szymar'rski
et al., 2006a, b). Interpretation of four parameters in Equation
(7) (Rh, 5, 17m and no) is taken from those studies (Holyst et al.,
2009; Kalwarczyk et al., 2011; Szymar'rski et al., 2006a, b). In
synthetic systems, 5 is the average distance between macromol-
ecular components of the complex liquid and Rh is equal to the
hydrodynamic radius of a polymer random coil or of a micelle.
In stRC, both 5 and Rh determine the viscosity experienced by
a probe diffusing in the investigated liquid. For rp >> R1,, the
probe experiences the macroscopic viscosity 17m. A probe of
radius rp smaller than 5 moving in the liquid experiences the
viscosity of the solvent no. On the other hand, a probe of
rp >5 will experience a viscosity higher than the viscosity of the
solvent. Finally, the effective viscosity 17 experienced by a probe
of radius between S and Rh (“.;‘<rp <Rh) depends exponentially
on rp. In case of the cytoplasm of mammalian cells, Rh corres-
ponds to the hydrodynamic radius of the ﬁlaments forming the
cellular cytoskeleton in the volume of the cytoplasm
(Kalwarczyk et al., 2011). The bacterial cytoskeleton (Shih and
Rothﬁeld, 2006), however, is located directly next to the inner
membrane (Pogliano, 2008). We can therefore assume that it
should not have a large contribution to the viscosity experienced
by the proteins diffusing across the cytoplasm. This assumption
is also supported by the value of Rh 2 42 :l: 9nm determined
from ﬁtting, which is similar to the radius of the objects identi-
ﬁed as fragments of the bacterial nucleoid (around 40 nm) (Kim
et al., 2004), i.e. loops of DNA covered with structural proteins.
This value can be compared with the value of the hydrodynamic
radius of the ﬁlaments forming the bacterial cytoskeleton (Hou
et al., 2012; Pogliano, 2008) (fragments of length L = 100 nm and
a radius r=2.5nm), which is ~17 nm Wandesande and
Persoons, 1985), well below Rh, obtained from the ﬁt.
Therefore, the length scale, Rh, is neither correlated with the
hydrodynamic radius of the ﬁlaments nor with the proteins
whose highest hydrodynamic radius is about 10 nm. S in the
cytoplasm of E. coli equals 0.51 :l: 0.09 nm and is comparable
with the average distance between proteins. Parameters of the
stRC (5 and Rh) depend on the internal structure of the cyto-
plasm (proteins density, size of the nucleoid, etc.). Thus, each cell
type will be characterized by a different shape of the reference
curve (due to differences in parameters 5 and Rh), while the
mathematical form of the stRC will not change, and such
curve can be constructed for other cell types.

3.3 Other models of diffusion in the cytoplasm

We compared our results with three models of diffusion in the
cytoplasm of E. coli, available in the literature (Figures 3 and 4).
McGuffee and Elcock (2010) proposed two models of diffusion
in the cytoplasm: the ‘steric’ model, which takes into account
only steric interactions between diffusing proteins, and the
‘full’ model, which includes steric, electrostatic and hydro-
dynamic interactions between diffusing entities. Comparison of
the results (Figure 3) shows that the model we propose takes into
account possible interactions between the diffusing probes and
the surrounding environment. Moreover, we show that the full
information needed to build the stRC can be obtained only
after taking into account the probes whose rp greatly exceeds Rh.
For example, simulations conducted by McGuffee and Elcock
(2010) include proteins that are most abundant in the cytoplasm,
but the absence of large objects such as the nucleoid leads to
underestimated values of Do/Dcyto. The effect starts to be mean-
ingful for probes whose rp > 10 nm. In that case, the values of
Do/Dcyto are lower by an order of magnitude with respect to
experimental results.

We also compared our results with the model proposed by
Mika and Poolman (2011), where Dcyto cc My]. As can be

seen, the power law dependence of Dcyto on MW may also lead
to underestimated values of Do/Dcyto. For example, for the ribo-
some 70S Do/Dcyto measured experimentally is ﬁve times higher
than predicted using power law dependence. Therefore, the
power law dependence proposed by Mika and Poolman (2011)
holds for the proteins in a small range of molecular weights
20—30 kDa and, moreover, is not applicable to macromolecules
other than proteins. This is because each type of macromolecules
(DNA, RNA, proteins, polymers, etc.), has different shape and
thus different dependence of rp on MW [Equations (1)—(5)]. The
shape of the macromolecule and in consequence its radius trans-
lates into the DC. The dependence of DC Dcyto of different types
of macromolecules (proteins, RNA and DNA) on their molecu-
lar weight is shown in Figure 4.

3.4 Accuracy of the model

Accuracy in determination of the stRC strongly depends on
the amount of available data. One would expect that increasing
the amount of data for probes of rp >> Rh and rp<S, would
signiﬁcantly decrease the maximum error of the stRC (com-
pare Fig. 2).

(open diamond, dashed line). The model proposed by Mika and
Poolman (2011) where Dcyto cc M?” is plotted as dashed—dotted line

To test the accuracy of the presented method, we perform an
analysis of the error of calculation of DC (SDCWo for GFP as a
function of the number of experimental data points. Using
Equation (7), we generated 10 datasets, where the number of
data points ranges from 6 to 100. The generated data were uni-
formly distributed on a logarithmic scale and were randomly
drawn on the assumption that measurement error is described
by a normal distribution with standard deviation 0 = 0.1. We
assumed that the error of rp equals to 5%. We found that 20 data
points are sufﬁcient to obtain 8Dcyto at the level of 20% for the
GFP (averaged over 10 generated datasets). In comparison,
(SDWto obtained from the analysis of the literature data was at
the level of 40% (cf. Fig. 2). This is mainly because of the small
number of available experimental data. Furthermore, most of the
experimental data are available for a narrow range of hydro-
dynamic radii (around 3nm, cf. Fig. 2) which is not preferred
in this type of analysis. To date, however, there is no experimen-
tal data which would improve the accuracy of the stRC.
Therefore, to improve the accuracy, additional experiments are
needed to cover a wider range of rp of the probes and also
uncertainties of D0, Dcyto and rp should be minimized.

3.5 DCs of proteins

Preparing a database of DCs of the entire proteome, one should
keep in mind that about 45% of the proteome are proteins

Molecular weight (kDa)
Fig. 4. Comparison of measured and predicted Dcyto as a function of
molecular weight of the investigated probes. Predicted dependencies
shown in the graph are expressed by Equation (7). The hydrodynamic
radius rp of each type of macromolecules is given by the relationship:
rp 2 CM; nm, where MW is the molecular weight of the macromolecule.
For proteins C: 0.0514 and or =0.392—Equation (1); RNA C: 0.0566
and or:0.38—Equation (2), linear DNA C=0.024 and 05:057—
Equation (3); circular DNA C=0.0125 and or:0.59—Equation (4);
super coiled C=0.0145 and or:0.57—Equation (5). For comparison,
we present experimental data on DCs of proteins (Cluzel et al., 2000;
Elowitz et al., 1999; English at al., 2011; Konopka et al., 2006; Kumar
et al., 2010; Mika et al., 2010; Mullineaux et al., 2006; Nenninger et al.,
2010; Slade et al., 2009), RNA (Golding and Cox, 2004), plasmid
(Campbell and Mullins, 2007) and ribosomes 30S and 70S (Bakshi
et al., 2012). The dashed—dotted straight line indicates the relationship
D cc My] proposed by Mika and Poolman (2011). The dependence of
Dcyto on MW proposed by Mika and Poolman (2011), when applied to
large plasmids (MW ~ 2 x 104 kDa), yields several orders of magnitude
overestimation of DC

forming a larger macromolecular complex (homo-, hetero-
oligomers and complexes of membrane proteins with transloca-
tion proteins). Thus, the calculation of DCs of proteins should be
carried out also for protein complexes. The Uniprot protein
database (preiler et al., 2011; Jain et al., 2009) contains infor-
mation on the molecular weight of proteins, their quaternary
structure and their location in cell. Using these data and
stRC (cf. Fig. 2) we calculated the DCs Dcyto of all proteins
in E. coli (Supplementary Table S1) present in the cytoplasm as
monomers (single polypeptide chains) or as multimers (homo- or
hetero-oligomers) or complexes composed of many chains, see
Fig. 5). Figure 5A shows the histogram of molecular weights of
cytoplasmic proteins, including homo- and hetero-multimers.
Distribution of molecular weights of proteins is given by
log-normal distribution with probability density function
q(MW) =( (2n)cMw)_1exp[—(ln(MW/,u.))2/(202)], where stand-
ard deviation 0 = 0.825 :l:0.007 and mean molecular weight
,u. = 31.9 :l: 0.3 kDa. The relationship between the DC and the
molecular weight of protein is expressed by the Equations (1) and
(7). A histogram of DCs of cytoplasmic proteins is shown in
Figure 5B (same proteins as in Fig. 5A). The distribution follows
the curve given by the probability density function:
p(Dcyto(Mw)) = q(MW)|dM(Dcyto)/chyto|-

We also calculated Dcyto of membrane proteins that are
~30% of the proteome of E. coli. Membrane proteins, after
synthesis by the ribosome, are transported to the membrane,
according to one of the two pathways: the TAT (Sargent,
2007) in which proteins are transported as single polypeptides
in a folded state and the Sec (Driessen and Nouwen, 2008) in
which unfolded proteins are complexed mainly by one of the two
proteins: SecB or Tig.

We created a database (Supplementary Table S1) listing the
DCs of all proteins, including their monomeric forms, the pos-
sible homo- and hetero-multimers, and in the case of membrane
proteins also the complexes with translocation proteins (SecB
and Tig). Apart from DCs of proteins, we calculated Dcyto of
small molecules such as amino acids or sugars and for macro-
molecules such as RNA or DNA (linear, circular and super
coiled). Calculated values of DCs are listed in Table 2.

The predicted DCs refer only to three-dimensional diffusion.
In cells, particularly eukaryotes, there are also other types of

transport such as molecular motors W ale, 2003). Nevertheless,
mobility, irrespective of the type of motion, is inversely propor-
tional to the viscosity of the surrounding environment. Since the
viscosity is dependent on the scale (Holyst et al., 2009;
Kalwarczyk et al., 2011; Szymar'rski et al., 2006a, h), each type
of motion will depend exponentially [Equation (7)] on the size of
a moving object.

3.6 Application of DC database in studies of biochemical
processes occurring in cells

Using the database of DCs, one can determine quantitatively
whether the protein diffuses freely or interacts and forms com-
plexes with much larger macromolecules, e. g. plasmids.
Capoulade et al. (2011) performed diffusion measurements and
showed that, in the nucleus of eukaryotic cell, euchromatin cre-
ates domains of high and low afﬁnity for heterochromatin pro-
tein (HPlor).

Another kind of analysis was performed by Elf et al. (2007).
Authors compared in vivo DCs of both: the lactose repressor in
its native form and the lactose repressor devoid of the
DNA-binding domain. Order of magnitude difference in the co-
efﬁcient of diffusion of both proteins led to the conclusion that
the native lactose repressor spends 87% of the time attached to
the DNA. This shows that the presence of attractive interactions
between diffusing particles will result in a slowdown of diffusion
of molecules.

To clarify the method, consider a hypothetical protein of
hydrodynamic radii rp = 3nm. The DCs of this protein Dcyto
(calculated from stRC) is approximately equal to
Dcyto = 8.7,um2/s. The time required by the protein to visit
every place in the cell volume [for E. coli V ~ 0.6 ,u.m3
(Kubitschek, 1990)] is approximately equal to t =
V/47tDcytorp % 1.8 s. Now suppose that the protein binds to a

plasmid whose molecular weight equals to 10 000 kDa, the DC of
the plasmid is of the order of Dplasm = 10‘4 ,amZ/s. Suppose
further that the protein spends one-tenth of the time diffusing
freely If, and the remaining 90% of time To as a complex with the
plasmid (rc = IOTf). The effective DCs of the complexes Deg,
deﬁned as Deff = (Dcyto + Dctc/ If) / (1 + Tc/Tf), and under as-
sumption that D0 = Dplasm, will be nearly an order of magnitude
lower than the predicted one (Dcyto):Deff = 0.8,u.m2/s. According
to the above analysis, we can assume that any deviation of ex-
perimentally measured DC from the proposed stRC will result
from intermolecular interactions such as speciﬁc or non-speciﬁc
binding.

3.7 Diffusion in the cytoplasm and the diffusion in
organelles of eukaryotes

Prokaryotic cells are characterized by small sizes [volume of E.
coli is approximately V ~ 0.6,u.m3 (Kubitschek, 1990)].
Measurements of diffusion in the cytoplasm of these cells are
performed for the entire volume of the cytoplasm. Thereby, the
effective DC measured in these experiments is the value averaged
over the entire volume of the cytoplasm. Because the stRC was
found on the basis of DCs, in the case of E. coli, this curve is also
averaged over the entire volume of the cell. At this point, it
should be stressed that the stRC should not be used to describe
diffusion on the cell membrane due to structural differences be-
tween membrane and cytoplasm, and the two-dimensional
nature of such diffusion.

Small sizes of prokaryotic cell also affect the long-time behav-
iour of diffusing objects. This is known as conﬁned diffusion
(Ochab—Marcinek and Holyst, 2011). Nevertheless, from the
normal, three-dimensional DCs (short time diffusion), one can
draw constructive conclusions. For example, English et al. (2011)
on the basis of short-time diffusion measurements have charac-
terized the catalytic cycle of RelA protein.

Eukaryotic cells are much larger than bacteria. Therefore,
measurements of diffusion in these cells are easier and can be
performed in the individual organelles [e. g. nucleus (Pederson,
2000)]. In previous work, we showed that it is possible to con-
struct a reference curve for the cytoplasm of mammalian HeLa
and Swiss 3T3 cells (Kalwarczyk, et al., 2011). However, based
on comparison of the results obtained by Lukacs et al. (2000) for
the cytoplasm and the nucleus of HeLa cancer cell, we expect
that the stRC determined for each cellular organelle is differ-
ent. Furthermore, as stRC depends on the structure of the
environment where diffusion occurs, it should be unique for a
given cell or even organelle.

4 CONCLUSION

The method presented above has a high predictive power.
Although, so far a large error of the method (40% for proteins),
the experimentally measured DCs coincide remarkably well with
the predicted DCs (cf. Fig. 4). Therefore, measurements of DCs
of several inert probes in a single cell type allow to determine the
DCs of thousands of proteins and other (macro)molecules.
Correctly designed experiment would require involvement of dif-
ferent experimental techniques (NMR, F RAP, F CS, particle
tracking) and the use of probes in a wide range of sizes.

One needs to know the DC of a given probe in water and/or
the hydrodynamic radius of this probe. Additionally for the same
probe, measurements of diffusion in cytoplasm of the cell should
be performed. Sizes of selected probes should be uniformly dis-
tributed along the logarithmic scale of sizes. We showed that
only 20 measurements are required to predict the cytoplasmic
DC of the typical protein with 20% accuracy.

Analysis of the stRC allows to determine the characteristic
length scales Rh and S, and the DC of any (macro)molecule in the
cytoplasm. For the cytoplasm of E. coli, we found that Rh is
surprisingly well correlated with the average radius of the
DNA loops forming the nucleoid. This suggests that the nucloeid
is the main crowding agent (responsible for the macroscopic vis-
cosity) in the cytoplasm of E. coli.

Finally, it should be noted that there are no additional require-
ments (except experimental data) to construct analogous data-
base of DCs in other systems such as the nucleus or
mitochondria of eukaryotic cells. We also believe that stRC
can be easily adopted to calculate other types of mobility, includ-
ing one-dimensional sliding, velocity of molecular motors, etc.,
as they all are inversely proportional to the viscosity.

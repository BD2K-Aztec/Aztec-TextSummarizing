ABSTRACT

Motivation: When genomic data are associated with gene expression
data, the resulting expression quantitative trait loci (eQTL) will likely
span multiple genes. eQTL prioritization techniques can be used to
select the most likely causal gene affecting the expression of a target
gene from a list of candidates. As an input, these techniques use
physical interaction networks that often contain highly connected
genes and unreliable or irrelevant interactions that can interfere with
the prioritization process. We present EPSILON, an extendable frame-
work for eQTL prioritization, which mitigates the effect of highly
connected genes and unreliable interactions by constructing a local
network before a network-based similarity measure is applied to select
the true causal gene.

Results: We tested the new method on three eQTL datasets derived
from yeast data using three different association techniques. A phys-
ical interaction network was constructed, and each eQTL in each
dataset was prioritized using the EPSILON approach: first, a local
network was constructed using a k—trials shortest path algorithm,
followed by the calculation of a network-based similarity measure.
Three similarity measures were evaluated: random walks, the
Laplacian Exponential Diffusion kernel and the Regularized
Commute-Time kernel. The aim was to predict knockout interactions
from a yeast knockout compendium. EPSILON outperformed two
reference prioritization methods, random assignment and shortest
path prioritization. Next, we found that using a local network signifi-
cantly increased prioritization performance in terms of predicted
knockout pairs when compared with using exactly the same network
similarity measures on the global network, with an average increase in
prioritization performance of 8 percentage points (P<10_5).

1 INTRODUCTION

Expression Quantitative Trait Locus (eQTL) analysis is the pro-
cess of associating genetic variation in a population with variable
gene expression to identify polymorphic genetic regions affecting
gene expression (Michaelson et al., 2009). Frequently, genetic
markers are used to sample the genetic diversity between indi-
viduals of an organism. Owing to linkage disequilibrium and the
spacing of the genetic markers on the genome, these genetic
markers represent a region on a chromosome that covers mul-
tiple genes rather than a single gene. The variability in expression
of the genes found to be associated with the eQTL (here referred
to as target genes) is most likely caused by a mutation in a single
gene located on the eQTL (the true causal gene). Yet, eQTL
analysis as such is not able to distinguish this causal gene from
the remainder of the genes located on the eQTL (the candidate
causal genes). Instead, gene prioritization or reﬁnement methods
are needed.

A number of prioritization methods that rank candidate genes
according to some criterion have been developed in the past [see
Tranchevent et al. (2011) for an extensive overview]. Typically,
these methods target novel (human) disease-gene identiﬁcation.
Information about the disease under study, i.e. in the form of a list
of existing disease genes is often needed. Other methods target
speciﬁc experiments for which additional data, divided in disease/
control groups, are required and cannot be readily applied to the
results of an eQTL analysis where such groups are not necessarily
present. Also, some of these techniques do not allow for the in-
corporation of a custom gene interaction network, as only pre-
deﬁned networks f or a limited number of organisms are available.
A smaller number of techniques were developed to tackle the
more speciﬁc eQTL prioritization task. All eQTL prioritization
methods have in common that they use a physical interaction
network to deﬁne a similarity measure between a target gene
and a set of candidate causal genes. The higher the network-
based similarity between the target and the candidate causal
gene, the more likely the candidate corresponds to the true
causal gene. Tu et al. (2006) developed a method based on
random walks (RWs) in a physical interaction network, an ap-
proach later reﬁned by Suthram et al. (2008), who extended the
RW idea with an electric circuit analogy. Voevodski et al. (2009)
applied the PageRank algorithm to develop a gene afﬁnity meas-
ure, and Stojmirovic and Yu (2012) used the mathematical mod-
eling of information ﬂow in a network to rank candidate genes.

EPSILON

 

According to Stojmirovié and Yu (2012), it is most important
to use directed relations (e.g. protein—DNA interactions) in the
interaction network whenever possible. They also suggest localiz-
ing the network, i.e. excluding distant genes from the network
that connects an origin (the target gene) with a set of destinations
(the candidate causal genes), before analysis to better reﬂect the
biological context. Otherwise, results of, for example, gene pri-
oritization will be highly dependent on the node degree of the
genes in the network. A high node degree can point to function-
ally useless genes (so-called promiscuous genes). However, genes
with a high node degree can also correspond to important hubs
(Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011). As a result, simply removing genes
from the network with a node degree exceeding an arbitrary
threshold or heuristically downweighting the importance of rela-
tions based on the number of connections risks removing useful
genes or important relations (Zotenko et al., 2008).

To overcome this problem, we propose EPSILON, an eQTL
prioritization framework using similarity measures derived from
local networks. The main assumption underlying EPSILON is
that the disturbing inﬂuence of highly connected genes and un-
reliable or irrelevant interactions can be controlled by reducing
the global interaction network to a local neighborhood (i.e. a
sub-network) connecting the target gene and all candidate
causal genes, before calculating a network-based similarity meas-
ure. Once the local network is constructed, a similarity measure
between the target gene and all candidate causal genes can be
calculated, and the candidate with the highest similarity can be
selected as the true causal gene. We demonstrate the added value
of a local approach for eQTL prioritization by plugging in es-
tablished prioritization methods such as path ﬁnding and RWs
in the EPSILON framework. Alternatively, we also investigate a
graph node kernel-based similarity measure. We evaluate the

2 EPSILON FRAMEWORK

An overview of the EPSILON reﬁnement scheme is presented in
Figure 1. As input, the results of an eQTL association analysis
are used. Three different association techniques were tested. It is
well-known that the results of eQTL analysis are highly depend-
ent on the mapping method used, and we wanted to avoid a
prioritization bias toward any method. We used Mixed Models
(MM), Non-Parametric Regression (NPR) and Elastic Net (EN)
regression for the association analysis, all of which are described
in the Section 5. The EPSILON method contains two steps,
which are applied to each association found: (i) construct,
from an existing global interaction network, a local sub-network
that connects the candidate causal genes covered by an eQTL
with the target gene and (ii) calculate a similarity measure that
expresses the functional similarity between the target gene and a
candidate causal gene. Both steps are elaborated later in the text.

2.1 Extraction of local networks

To restrict the network around a set of candidate causal genes
and a target gene, a shortest/cheapest path approach is applied.
All interactions are assigned a cost (see later in the text), and an
optimal path from each candidate to the target was found using
the Dijkstra algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959). All genes and inter-
actions that were found on such a shortest path were included
in the sub-network. Furthermore, it was investigated whether
enlarging this neighborhood could improve the prioritization re-
sults. This was achieved by k times considering if an alternative
shortest path exists, i.e. different from any previously found path

chromosome

(blue) of an eQTL—a genetic polymorphism that is linked to a differentially expressed target gene (green)—are identiﬁed, and a local network connecting
all the candidates with the single target gene is constructed. Then, for each candidate, a network based similarity measure is calculated, relating the
candidate to the target. The candidate that is most similar to the target gene is picked as the prioritized gene

(see Section 5 for a detailed description). All the alternative paths
are merged afterwards to form the local sub-network. Because it
is expected that the value of k will inﬂuence the size of the sub-
network, EPSILON was run with different values for k. Our
localization method is expected to mediate the inﬂuence of
highly connected genes. Even if an unwanted hub were included
in the local network connecting a candidate with the target, it
will have at most 2k connections (in the unlikely case where all k
paths enter and leave the hub through different interactions),
instead of potentially tens or hundreds of connections.
Evidently, the higher the quality of the underlying network, the
higher the quality of the local networks will be, but by using a
shortest/cheapest path-based approach, unreliable or irrelevant
(when connecting a speciﬁc causal gene with the target gene)
connections will only be followed when there is no more reliable
or relevant alternative available. The algorithm will not remove
shortcuts (indirect interactions between two genes/proteins that
do not reﬂect a true physical relation) from the local networks,
but only when they are present as high-conﬁdence interactions.

A naive nearest neighborhood method (take neighbors, neigh-
bors of neighbors, etc.) was tested, but the presence of hubs
in the network rendered this approach useless because the result-
ing connected sub-networks were almost as large as the global
network. Results for this approach were therefore not considered
in further analysis.

Because the choice of the measure for strength or conﬁdence
inﬂuences the outcome of path ﬁnding methods, we evaluated
three different weight-value schemes. Standard and similar to Tu
et al. (2006) and Suthram et al. (2008), we used expression
correlation as edge weights. As a ﬁrst alternative, we used the
conﬁdence scores obtained in the network construction process
(see Section 5), and, ﬁnally, we tested a simple qualitative weight-
ing scheme of setting edge weights to 1 when an interaction is
present and 0 otherwise. Several network-based prioritization
methods (e. g. Suthram et al., 2008) apply, before the application
of the actual prioritization method, an extra constraint to the
interaction network: based on biological considerations, it is
demanded that a target gene be reached through a directed
protein—DNA (transcription factor) interaction. We tested
whether applying this transcription factor-based ﬁltering
(TF-ﬁltering) before local sub-network construction could
improve prioritization performance.

2.2 Network similarity measures

Once the local network connecting all candidate causal genes with
the target gene is constructed, the EPSILON framework requires
the calculation of a network similarity measure between the target
gene and all candidates to assess their functional relatedness. In
principle, any network-based similarity measure could be inte-
grated. Several authors (e.g. Shih and Parthasarathy, 2012;
Suthram et al., 2008; Tu et al., 2006) propose a random walk
(RW) approach, in which an RW is initiated a high number of
times from a candidate causal gene, and it is measured how many
times a random walker is found in the target gene. The probabil-
ity of choosing a particular direction is a function of a weight
value associated with each interaction. Obviously, the candidate
causal gene that yields the highest number of arrivals in the target
gene is chosen to be the true causal gene.

Next to integrating RWs in EPSILON, we investigated kernels
calculated on graph nodes as an alternative similarity measure.
These kernels are an attractive tool for uncovering relations in
large networks (Fouss et al., 2006). As already demonstrated by
Kohler et al. (2008), LaVi et al. (2012), Nitsch et al. (2010) and Qi
et al. (2008), kernels operating on nodes in a biological network
can be used as functional gene similarity measures. In this
study, we evaluated two well-known kernels, the Regularized
Commute-Time (RCT) kernel and the Laplacian Exponential
Diffusion (LED) kernel. Both are described in the Section 5.
The LED and RCT kernels operate on undirected networks.
Kernels operating on directed networks do exist, but their calcu-
lation does not scale well for large graphs (Mantrach et al.,
2010). Even though we use undirected kernels, the local sub-net-
work on which the kernels are calculated is constructed using
path ﬁnding techniques operating on a directed global network.
The calculation of the kernels results in a similarity matrix
containing the similarity between all possible pairs of genes in
the network. From this matrix, the candidate-target pair with the
highest similarity is easily found.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Benchmark dataset

To investigate whether reducing the global network to a local
network, before applying a network-based similarity measure,
can aid in identifying the true causal genes in a set of eQTL,
we applied several reﬁnement strategies to the well-characterized
dataset of Brem and Kruglyak (2005). They proﬁled simultan-
eously the genotype and expression phenotype of 112 yeast seg-
regants. eQTL were determined as described later in the text, and
for each eQTL, candidate causal genes were identiﬁed (see
Section 5). Prioritization resulted for each eQTL-target combin-
ation in a single prioritized causal gene.

Each prioritized causal gene—target gene combination was eval-
uated against the experimental knockout dataset of Hughes et al.
(2000), as described in Ourfali et al. (2007), Suthram et al. (2008)
and Yeang et al. (2004) (In Supplementary Fig. S2, we present a
graphical overview of the evaluation strategy.) Here, for each ex-
periment, the knocked-out gene is considered a true causal gene.
Genes that are affected by the knockout are assumed to be poten-
tial targets. Each knockout experiment thus results in a list of
presumably true causal-target gene combinations. For all
causal-target knockout combinations in such a list, we look for
couples of genes that also appear in the result of an association
analysis. This means that we look for those associations for which
one of the candidate causal genes is the same as the causal gene in a
knockout pair, and for which the target gene is identical to that of
the same knockout pair. To make sure that we are evaluating the
gene prioritization, and not the quality of the network, the
number of combinations is further reduced by demanding that
there exist a path in the directed interaction network between
the causal and the target gene. These so—called true combinations
of causal-target genes derived from the knockout dataset, that
also appear in an eQTL-analysis, determine the maximal reference
performance. A performant gene prioritization procedure is
assumed to approximate this list of gold standard knockout
pairs. Performance here is deﬁned as the amount of overlap of

the prioritization results with the target list of knockout pairs or
alternatively: performanceznumber 0f retrieved knockout pairs.
Relative performance is then deﬁned as performance/maximum
number of retrievable knockout pairs. Because a different associ-
ation technique will result in different associations, and conse-
quently in a different reference list of knockout pairs, absolute
performance depends on the association technique used.

3.2 Association analysis

We applied three commonly used association techniques to the
SNP and expression data (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) of Brem
and Kruglyak (2005): non-parametric regression (NPR), mixed
models (MM) and elastic net regression (EN) regression (see
Section 5).

The genetic variability in the yeast dataset is expected to be
low, as a limited number of segregants derived from a cross of
only two parental strains were tested. Also, gene expression was
determined under a single experimental condition. Consequently,
it is likely that only a limited number of true eQTL will be
detected. Remarkably, the three association techniques yield
different results, as is illustrated in Figure 2. Only 662 eQTL
are detected by all three methods, even when for each method,
the 10 000 most reliable associations are selected. In general, the
NPR results in a high number of associations, both cis and trans.
The MM almost exclusively produces cis associations, which
conﬁrms the ﬁndings of Kang et al. (2008) and Listgarten
et al. (2010). The EN produces a much sparser association
map, with less cis than trans associations.

To make the evaluation of the tested gene reﬁnement strategies
independent of the outcome of the association analysis, we tested
all described gene prioritization schemes on the results of each
association method separately. For each association method, the
associations that were prioritized were chosen in such a way
(using P—Values, see Section 5) that the size of the gold standard
reference list was of the same order of magnitude (see
Supplementary Table S1). As only a small number of knockout
pairs can be found overlapping with the EN associations, even
with an elevated P—Value cutoff, we also included the unﬁltered
EN results (containing all eQTL found by the EN feature selec-
tion technique) in any further analysis.

3.3 EPSILON prioritization results

To demonstrate the added value of the EPSILON approach, i.e.
extracting a local sub-network before applying a network-based
similarity measure, we compared the results obtained using
different similarity measures in combination with both local net-
works and the global network. All local networks were based on

the k—trials shortest path network construction method outlined
above with k: 5. The global network corresponded to the ori-
ginal interaction network (and not a local network with a very
high k value). As an established benchmark strategy, we used a
shortest path-based method, which comes down to taking the
candidate causal gene that lies closest to the target gene (see
Section 5). As a baseline, we performed a random assignment,
i.e. randomly picking a candidate from the list of available can-
didate causal genes. All reﬁnement methods except random
assignment were tested with and without TF—ﬁltering [suggested
by Suthram et al. (2008)], meaning that before local network
construction or to the application of a global similarity measure,
the global network is modiﬁed in such a way that target genes
only contain incoming transcription factor interactions. The full
prioritization result matrix is shown in Supplementary Table S1.
In what follows, we highlight the insights that can be drawn from
these results.

Figure 3 shows, in relative terms, the difference in prioritiza-
tion performance between the use of a local network over a
global network. In all cases, over all association mapping tech-
niques, pre—ﬁltering steps and prioritization methods, using a
local network is beneﬁcial, with a maximum and minimum
gain of 15 and 2 percentage points, both for the EN associations
prioritized with a RCT kernel, but respectively with and without
TF-ﬁltering. In general, using a local network yields signiﬁcantly
better performance compared with using the global network with
an average gain of 8 percentage points (paired two-tailed t-test,
P<10_5). On average (over all association techniques and TF-
ﬁltering possibilities), the RCT kernel yields the highest perform-
ance (58%), and the RWs yield the worst (55%); yet, these dif-
ferences were not statistically signiﬁcant (P=0.l3 three-way
analysis of variance). The EN associations were more difﬁcult
to prioritize than the associations obtained with MMs and NPR,
with a maximum performance of respectively 41, 63 and 55%

(no TF—ﬁlter). The average performance (averaged over priori-
tization methods and association techniques) is only slightly
better when TF-ﬁltering is applied than when it is not (50%
without TF-ﬁltering, 51% with TF—ﬁltering). Moreover, this dif-
ference is not statistically signiﬁcant (paired two-tailed t-test,
P = 0.15).

As a typical example, we present the results for NPR without
TF—ﬁltering in Table l. The largest overlap with the target list is
obtained using a local LED or RCT kernel (55 %). As expected,
all methods show a much higher overlap with the target list
compared with random assignment. The shortest path method
performs slightly better (50%) than the global methods; yet, it
shows a smaller overlap with the target list than the local
methods.

3.4 Size of the local neighborhood

We evaluated the added value of using a relaxed local neighbor-
hood. This was achieved by varying the parameter k in the k-
trials shortest path neighborhood construction algorithm be-
tween 1 and 20. Local networks generated with different values
of k for a single eQTL-target combination are displayed in
Figure 4. It can clearly be seen how, for small values of k,
local networks remain sparse. Nodes with a high node degree
in the global network sometimes (but not always) become hubs
again in the local network for large values of k. Indeed when
k —> co, the local network will resemble the global network more
closely (see Section 5).

Experiments were run for the eQTL obtained with the
NPR using the RW similarity measure and the LED and RCT
kernels. The results are displayed in Figure 5. A number of ob-
servations can be made. First, the lowest performance is obtained
for k: 1, corresponding to a local network constructed using
a single shortest path. Second, although the maximum overall
performance is recorded for the RCT kernel, this kernel seems
to be more sensitive to the value of k, as more performance
variation can be observed. Third, the RCT kernel behaves as
expected, i.e. performance is suboptimal for low values of k,
reaches a maximum for intermediate values and drops when k
becomes too large, and consequently the local networks lose
their local characteristics. The RW measure and the LED

kernel do not show this performance drop, but the results of
the application of global similarity measures (Table 1) indicate
that both suffer from a performance drop when the underlying
interaction network becomes too large. Finally, a remarkable
performance drop around a k-Value of 7 can be observed,
for all methods. Closer investigation of the eQTL data and
the local networks constructed indicates that this is due to mis-
prioritization of a single eQTL that is shared by a number
of genes. In this case, the error is caused by the inclusion of a
gene that is relatively distant in a directed network, but close
in an undirected network. As explained in the Section 5, the
application of kernels implies an undirected network. When
the neighborhood again becomes larger, the method quickly
recovers from this error.

3.5 Edge weight type

The choice of edge weight is non-trivial and an issue for shortest

arios: (i) edge weights are set proportional to the expression
correlation; (ii) weight-values are set to the Bayesian classiﬁer
score obtained in the global network construction process (see
Section 5); and (iii) values (in the adjacency matrix, see Section 5)
are simply set to one if an interaction is present.

In Figure 6, the inﬂuence of the choice of weights on the
prioritization performance is illustrated. Three edge weight
types, expression correlation, Bayesian score and a qualitative
approach (with edge weights set to one) and two kernel types,
an RW and a shortest path method are evaluated using the
MM associations. From the ﬁgure, it is clear that the Bayesian
score outperforms the expression correlation approach, but
differences are small in terms of maximum relative performance
(LED kernel: 62% for Expression correlation, 66% for Bayesian
score). Remarkably, the qualitative approach where edge weights
are simply set to 1 still yields comparable results.

3.6 Comparison with other techniques

To put the result of prioritization with EPSILON in perspective,
we compared our approach with two alternative techniques that
can be used to perform eQTL prioritization: Information
Transduction Module (ITM) Probe (Stojmirovié and Yu, 2009,
2012) and eQTL Electrical Diagrams (eQED) (Suthram et al.,
2008) (for the implementation details of both methods, see
Section 5). ITM Probe was tested in normalized channel mode,
in which an RW is executed that has, at each step, a ﬁxed prob-
ability of terminating. In this way, ITM Probe is implicitly gen-
erating a localized biological context. We obtained results that
are in general on par with EPSILON (LED kernel, k=5,
a=0.001, see Table 2). For the MM associations, EPSILON
showed increased performance over ITM Probe, with 63 and
55% overlap, respectively, with the target knockout list.
Second, we compared EPSILON with eQED. The eQED uses
an electric circuit model (operating on a global network) to
prioritize candidate causal genes. Unfortunately, eQED does
not support the use of phosphorylation interactions (PI), and

Table 2. Relative performance comparison of EPSILON
(LED kernel, k = 5, a = 0.001) with ITM Probe (No TF-ﬁlter)

 

 

EPSILON ITM Probe
NPR 0.55 0.53
EN all features 0.41 0.38
MMs 0.63 0.55

 

a thorough comparison was impossible because the network
used by EPSILON could not be used as input for eQED. We
did perform a limited comparison (on the NPR associations),
using a reduced network (see Section 5). We found an overlap
of 65% for EPSILON (LED kernel, k=5, a=0.001) and 54%
for eQED.

4 DISCUSSION

In this manuscript, we presented EPSILON, a framework for
eQTL prioritization that ranks a number of candidate causal
genes, overlapping an eQTL based on their functional similarity
with the target gene associated with the eQTL. The method con-
sists of two steps: (i) local network construction and (ii) the
application of a network-based similarity measure. EPSILON
is a modular framework that allows for the incorporation of
existing network construction procedures and network similari-
ties. We evaluated a k-trials shortest path network construction
method together with RW and kernel-based similarity measures
using a gold standard dataset derived from a yeast knockout
compendium. We were able to show that our approach, the com-
bination of local networks with network-based similarity meas-
ures, outperformed random assignment and a shortest path
reference method. More interestingly, the global network ana-
logues of the network similarity measures too were outperformed
signiﬁcantly (P< 10—5), clearly showing the added value of using
local over global networks. We assume that constraining the
global network to a local neighborhood around the target gene
and all candidate causal genes is effectively reducing the disturb-
ing impact of hubs and promiscuous genes. Highly connected
genes (in the global network) may still be present in the local
networks, but the number of interactions those genes participate
in will be signiﬁcantly reduced. An additional explanation of the
difference between a local and global approach is the inclusion of
directional information in the sub-network construction, even
though direction information is not used for the calculation
of the similarity measures. There are indications that the LED
kernel outperforms the RW similarity measure, but more
research is needed to conﬁrm this.

We observed large differences in prioritization performance
when different eQTL datasets were used (MM, NPR and EN).
Especially the EN eQTL seemed to be more difﬁcult to prioritize.
Possibly, the quality of the EN associations was lower than that
of the other association techniques.

All experiments were run with and without TF-ﬁltering.
TF—ﬁltering is a technique used by several other authors where
it is demanded that a target gene be reached through transcrip-
tion factor interactions. We were not able to detect any signiﬁ-
cant effect of TF—ﬁltering on the results obtained.

We investigated the sensitivity of the local similarity measures
to the value of the parameter k, controlling the size of the local
sub-network in the network construction algorithm. All network
similarity measures yield a near optimal performance for
k-Values of 5, the value we recommend to use as the running
time of the local network construction and the similarity measure
calculation increases signiﬁcantly with higher values of k.

Next, we investigated the inﬂuence of different edge weight
types on the prioritization process. Three variants were evalu-
ated: expression correlation, a Bayesian score and a qualitative
weighting scheme where all edges were set to one. Remarkably,
in some cases, optimal results were obtained with the qualitative
weighting scheme. This indicates that the mere presence of an
interaction is more important than its associated weight. In the
absence of reliable edge weights, one can thus revert to qualita-
tive edge weights, simply expressing the presence or absence of
interactions.

Finally, EPSILON was compared with two other methods,
ITM Probe and eQED. We found that EPSILON performed
as well or better than ITM Probe. EPSILON clearly outper-
formed eQED, be it using a reduced network because eQED
could not deal with the PIs present in the global network.

Importantly, we should note that the intuitive network con-
struction method we present could be replaced by a more
advanced algorithm; yet, our approach has the advantage of
simplicity and performance. The network-based similarities too
could be replaced by more specialized variants. For instance, the
eQED method of Suthram et al. (2008) could be integrated
within the EPSILON framework, given that the eQED model
was extended to incorporate other types of interactions.

5 MATERIALS AND METHODS
5.1 eQTL analysis

To detect associations between SNP and gene expression data, we used
the S. cerevisiae data of Brem and Kruglyak (2005). The SNP dataset
consists of 2956 individual markers for 112 segregants from a laboratory
strain and a wild strain. As strong linkage disequilibrium can be observed,
the dataset exhibits substantial redundancy. We reduced the dataset to
404 haplotype blocks using estimates of the recombination probability at
each marker. Reducing individual markers to haplotype blocks spanning
multiple SNPs inherited together avoids part of the multiple testing prob-
lem associated with many eQTL detection methods, but will increase the
genomic region covered by the eQTL found.

The gene expression data contained full genome expression values
(6130 genes) for the same 112 segregants. Before further analysis, the
expression data were re-normalized. Associations were detected using
three methods. As a reference, we used the NPR technique (Wilcoxon
rank regression) as applied by Brem et al. (2002). Next, analogous to
Suthram et al. (2008), the MM approach of Kang et al. (2008) was
adopted. This method is known to correct for possibly hidden confounds
like population structure or laboratory batches. Finally, we choose EN
regression as a state-of—the—art association technique (Basu et al., 2011;
Michaelson et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2009). The EN regression was executed
to retrieve a maximum of 10 associations per target gene.

For the MM regression, we used the implementation of Kang et al.
(2008), which can be found at http://genetics.cs.ucla.edu/ice. For the non-
parametric and the MM regression, a matrix of association probabilities
was obtained in a straightforward way. Probabilities were ﬁltered using
P< 0.05 and P< 0.1 for the NPR and the MMs, respectively. The thresh-
olds for the P-Values were chosen so that the remaining associations

contained a comparable number of knockout pairs that can be used for
evaluation purposes, as explained in the Sections 3 and 4. For the EN,
probabilities were approximated by applying a multiple regression to
the selected predictors, a strategy suggested by Wu et al. (2009). EN
probabilities were then ﬁltered based on their approximated P—Value
(P< 0.1). Because this resulted in a low number of remaining associ-
ations, we also ran the prioritization method on the full EN dataset,
i.e. without any P—Value ﬁltering.

5.2 Generating candidate causal genes

For each eQTL, we enumerated all genes that overlap (within 5 kb) the
region of the chromosome spanned by the haplotype block that associates
with a certain target gene. This approach differs slightly from the one
adopted by Suthram et al. (2008), where a locus contains all genes that
are related to the same closest marker (within a buffer of 10 kb). Our ap-
proach will necessarily yield larger loci with a higher number of candidates.

5.3 Network construction

We built a physical interaction network for S. cerevisiae containing pro-
tein—protein interactions (PPI), transcription factor—DNA interactions
(TF—DNA) and P1. In the network, a gene name can represent both a
translated protein and a chunk of DNA. Protein interaction data were
downloaded from The Biological General Repository for Interaction
Data sets database (Stark et al., 2011). After removing self-interactions,
this PPI dataset consisted of 49 381 unique interactions. TF—DNA inter-
actions, predicted both de novo as from several ChIP-chip experiments
were obtained from Beyer et al. (2006). Their dataset consisted of 7817
high conﬁdent TF—DNA interaction predictions. Kinase—substrate inter-
action data were obtained from Ptacek et al. (2005). With the use of prote-
ome chip technology, the authors identiﬁed 4183 in vitro phosphorylation
events involving 1325 different proteins in yeast with a low false positive
rate. Only high-quality PPI interactions were allowed in the ﬁnal inter-
action network. This was achieved by using a supervised Bayesian classiﬁer
that was trained on a set of known interactions derived from literature
(Reguly et al., 2006). As inputs, the classiﬁer uses features derived from
expression data, known and predicted domain interactions, network top-
ology and phylogenetic proﬁle similarity. For a more elaborate discussion
of the network construction, see Supplementary Data. Our ﬁnal network
contains 4375 genes (connected by 35 569 interactions) that are also present
in the eQTL datasets. Contrary to Suthram et al. (2008) who selected only
regulatory proteins contained in 11 Munich Information Center for
Protein Sequences (MIPS) categories, we did not ﬁlter the network to
only contain interactions found in regulatory pathways. For all experi-
ments except one, we used the inverse of the absolute value of the expres-
sion correlation between the two genes involved in the interaction for the
edge weights. In a single experiment, we evaluated the choice of weight
value by comparing it to two other variants: (i) edge weights are set to
l /(sc0re — minimumScore + 0.1), using the score obtained by the Bayesian
classiﬁer discussed before and (ii) the edges are simply given a value of one.

5.4 Validation data

To evaluate the proposed method, we used the knockout dataset of
Hughes et al. (2000). The data were preprocessed by Ourfali et al.
(2007) and can be downloaded from http://cs.tau.ac.il/~roded/SPINE.
html. Each time a variant of the proposed method or a reference
method is evaluated, the knockout dataset is ﬁltered to contain only
the knockout pairs that are also found in the network and the eQTL
datasets (see Sections 3 and 4).

5.5 k-trials shortest paths neighborhoods

An intuitive algorithm was constructed that tries k times to ﬁnd an alter-
native path between each candidate causal gene and the target gene using

EPSILON

 

the Dijkstra shortest path algorithm (Dijkstra, 1959). In what follows, we
will use path cost in stead of path length, as this allows for easier inter-
pretation of the algorithm. Each time, the cheapest path is made more
expensive by multiplying each edge weight on the path with a constant
factor f (set to 1.2 in this study). The algorithm results in at most k alter-
native paths connecting the target with each of the candidates. Often,
values of k > 1 will not result in exactly k alternative paths, as it is possible
that no (cheap) alternative paths exist. For a k value of 5, the average
number of alternative paths was between 2 and 3, for the datasets we
used. Once the alternative paths are found, a local neighborhood is con-
structed by merging all paths found into a single sub-network. Large
values of k will result in larger sub-networks that will be more similar,
but not necessarily identical, to the global network.

The parameter k is an upper bound of the number of paths that will be
included in the local network, and the parameter f controls how different
the alternative paths should be. Values of f very close to 1 will likely yield
a single cheapest path or small variants of the cheapest path (unless paths
with equal cost exist, see later in the text), as the same path is found over
and over, even when it is made more expensive. The parameter f controls
how much more costly path k can be for it to be picked, when compared
with the ﬁrst cheapest path found (i.e. f). The k-trials shortest paths
algorithm can be considered a heuristic variant of the more complicated
k—shortest path problem (see e.g. Hershberger et al., 2007), but the latter
will always yield k paths (at least when k paths exist), even when some
of those paths are less relevant. Also, by making the entire path more
expensive, the k-trials algorithm is pushed to ﬁnd real alternative paths
instead of variants of an existing path. Paths with equal costs were
not treated in a special way because this is unlikely to happen when
expression correlation or a Bayesian score is used for edge weights.
Furthermore, it such paths would be found (which is more likely when,
for example, all edge weights are set to 1), sufﬁciently large values of
k will alleviate the problem.

5.6 RWs and kernels

The RW similarity measure is an estimate of the probability that a target
gene is reached when initiating an RW starting from different candidate
causal genes. For each local network, new RWs were initiated from the
target gene until the sum of the arrival count over all candidate causal
genes was equal to 10 000. Using the target gene as the starting point of the
RW is possible because we used undirected networks as input for the RW
procedure. Once a candidate is reached, the RW is aborted; therefore, no
walk Visits a candidate gene more than once. The candidate with the high-
est arrival count is chosen to be the true causal gene. The approach
described earlier in the text is less accurate and slow for large global net-
works. As an alternative to simulating RWs, it is possible to calculate the
ﬁnal number of Visits in each network node based on the (Moore-Penrose)
pseudo-inverse of the weighted Laplacian matrix L = D — A, with D the
diagonal degree matrix (D(i, i) 2 21:1 A(i, j), n is the number of genes)
and A the adjacency matrix of the interaction network. For each eQTL,
the global matrix A was updated in such a way that the candidate causal
genes in the eQTL had no outgoing connections. This corresponds to
terminating a RW once a candidate gene is reached.

Next to RWs, we integrated kernel-based similarity measures in the
EPSILON framework. A kernel calculated on a graph provides a quan-
titative measure of similarity between two nodes (i.e. genes) in a graph,
which is also a vector inner product in a possibly high dimensional feature
space. Depending on the type of kernel, the similarity measure can be
interpreted in different physical ways. Fouss et al. (2006) provides a
comprehensive overview of different kernel types and their interpretation.
We decided to use two kernel types that have been used for gene priori-
tization before (N itsch et al., 2010), be it in a different context and meth-
odology. The ﬁrst is the LED Kernel that is calculated as follows:

KLED = 670617 

KLED is the kernel matrix that contains the evaluation of the kernel
function for each gene—gene combination. It is calculated on the weighted
Laplacian matrix. The adjacency matrix has been made symmetrical by
taking the per element maximum of the non-symmetrical adjacency
matrix and its transpose. KLED(i, j) contains, at time t = a, the quantity
found in node iwhen a unit quantity starts diffusing from node j at t = 0
(Fouss et al., 2006).

Analogous to Nitsch et al. (2010), the second kernel we use is the RCT
Kernel:

Km = (D — Mr1 (2)

Here, KRCT is the kernel matrix, D the degree matrix deﬁned above,
and A the adjacency matrix. KRCT(i, j) corresponds to the probability of
Visiting node i when starting from node j where a random walker has
a(1 — a) probability of disappearing at each step (Fouss et al., 2006).
Both kernels are centered and normalized in feature space by applying
the following transformations:

5.7 Comparison with other techniques

We compared EPSILON with ITM Probe (Stojmirovié and Yu, 2009,
2012) and eQED (Suthram et al., 2008), two methods that can be used
to identify the true causal gene in an eQTL. The stand-alone version of
the ITM Probe software (Python, V 1.5.2) was downloaded from ftp: / /ftp.
ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pub/qmbpmn/qmbpmn-tools/src and slightly modiﬁed
(input/output routines only) to accommodate our experimental setup.
We ran the model in normalized channel mode. For each eQTL-target
pair, we set the ITM Probe source gene to the target gene, and the ITM
Probe sinks to the candidate causal genes for the eQTL. The ﬁnal causal
gene corresponds to the sink with the maximum value in the resulting
H matrix. In normalized channel mode, the ITM Probe model is con-
trolled by a single parameter, the damping factor df. We ran the model
with df values ranging from 0.1 to 1.0 and recorded for each association
technique the optimal result. The model was fed with the exact same
networks (no TF-ﬁltering) as used to evaluate EPSILON.

Next to ITM Probe, we investigated whether it was possible to com-
pare EPSILON with eQED. The software was downloaded from http://
www.stanford.edu/ssuthram/eQED/. eQED does not allow for the dis-
tinction between directed transcription factor interactions and directed
PIs. This distinction is needed because eQED always applies TF-ﬁltering,
treating all directed interactions as TF-interactions. Consequently, the
interaction network used in this study could not be used as input for
eQED. We tested eQED using a network without HS and the NPR
eQTLs and reran EPSILON using the same reduced network.

5.8 Parameter tuning and running time

The calculation of the two kernel types, KLED and KRCT, requires the
estimation of a parameter a. An extensive parameter sweep was per-
formed. We found an optimal, general applicable value of the parameter
a to be 0.001 for the LED kernel and 0.9 for the RCT kernel. We also
found that the kernel-based similarity measure is not sensitive to this
parameter a, as performance deteriorates only when a is changed with
an order of magnitude. Testing indicated that near optimal performance
can be obtained with a value of 5 for the k parameter in the k trials
shortest path neighborhood construction algorithm (see Fig. 5) and
1.2—2.0 for the multiplier constant. As the running time of the algorithm
increases considerably with higher values of k, all experiments were

executed with the lowest k value that results in optimal performance, i.e.
k: 5. For the multiplier, 1.2 was chosen.

Even though the time complexity of calculation of the kernels used will
be of order 0(V?) with V], the number of genes in the local network, the
running time of EPSILON in practice (for reasonably small values of k
yielding small local networks, and for a single eQTL-target prioritization
task) is determined by the path-ﬁnding algorithm. We implemented the
Dijkstra path-ﬁnding algorithm using a Fibonacci heap, resulting in a
time complexity of 0(k(Eg + Vg.log(Vg))) with Vg the number of genes
in the global network, and Eg the number of interactions in the global
network. With k: 5, it takes 40 seconds to prioritize 1000 eQTL-target
combinations using a single core of a 64 bit Intel i3 processor.

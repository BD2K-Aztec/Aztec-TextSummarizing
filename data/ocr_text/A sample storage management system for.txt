ABSTRACT

Summary: Establishment of large-scale biobanks of human
specimens is essential to conduct molecular pathological or
epidemiological studies. This requires automation of procedures
for specimen cataloguing and tracking through complex analytical
processes. The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC)
develops a large portfolio of studies broadly aimed at cancer
prevention and including cohort, case—control and case-only studies
in various parts of the world. This diversity of study designs,
structure, annotations and specimen collections is extremely difficult
to accommodate into a single sample management system (SMS).
Current commercial or academic SMS are often restricted to a few
sample types and tailored to a limited number of analytic workflows
[Voegele et al. (2007) A laboratory information management system
(LIMS) for a high throughput genetic platform aimed at candidate
gene mutation screening. Bioinformatics, 23, 2504—2506].

Thus, we developed a system based on a three-tier architecture
and relying on an Oracle database and an Oracle Forms web
application. Data are imported through forms or csv files, and
information retrieval is enabled via multi-criteria queries that can
generate different types of reports including tables, Excel files,
trees, pictures and graphs. The system is easy to install, flexible,
expandable and implemented with a high degree of data security
and confidentiality. Both the database and the interface have been
modeled to be compatible with and adaptable to almost all types of
biobanks.

1 INTRODUCTION: SCOPE OF SINGLE SAMPLE
MANAGEMENT SYSTEM

The International Agency for Research on Cancer (IARC) Biological
Resource Center hosts about 1 million samples from over 50
different studies. It contains both population-based and disease-
based collections consisting of samples of various nature and
origins.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The ﬁrst requirement of single sample management system (SMS)
is to harness the inherent variability and heterogeneity in the types
of storage units and in the storage levels. At the inception of
the project, a review of collections and facilities was conducted,
providing a basis for deﬁning extensive speciﬁcations incorporating
the whole range of IARC sample diversity. The storage infrastructure
is made up of three main categories of containers: liquid nitrogen
tanks, freezers and fridges and dedicated humidity-controlled rooms,
at various temperatures and each including several subtypes of
containers. A comprehensive and strict hierarchy from single tube up
to room deﬁnes the precise position of each sample location within
the system. The exact capacity of each storage level is determined
in order to monitor unused storage capacity. These hierarchies
are relatively stable but the system has the capacity to evolve by
incorporating new hierarchical levels, new storage devices within
each level as well as movements and transfer of samples within
each hierarchical level (See Supplementary Material: SD-l).

The second requirement for SMS is to keep track of all
samples or containers movements and status changes, including
the management of dynamic processes from specimen retrieval to
extraction and aliquoting of by—products and transfer to in-house
analytical platforms as well as shipment to other research centers.

The third requirement for SMS is to allow for simple and rapid
import of existing information from various databases, documents
and sheets and to accommodate the full range of information
available for each particular specimen collection. In this way, SMS
does not replace the study— speciﬁc databases developed by clinicians
and epidemiologists but interfaces with them to provide a dynamic
sample and data management system.

Finally, the SMS needs to comply with levels of data safety and
conﬁdentiality compatible with the high ethical standards of research
conducted on human biospecimens.

In this article, we describe how our SMS addresses all these
requirements, and how it operates to handle large datasets through
a simple and user-friendly interface.

2 RESULTS: DEVELOPMENT OF SMS

The SMS is based on a three-tier architecture with one Linux
database server, one Windows 2003 application server and multiple
clients (either PC or Mac) integrated into the Agency’s internal
network, secured within a strict ﬁrewall.

2.1 Database architecture

Given the size of the datasets, the relational database was developed
under Oracle 10g R2, which can manage a high volume of data
and transactions, providing high query performances. It includes

powerful tools to ensure safety and reliability with a high degree of
recoverability and audit.

Taking into account the needs and speciﬁcations laid out before,
the database model was designed to provide large ﬂexibility to
accommodate evolution of storage facilities. The model of the
IARC biobank includes major tables identifying uniquely projects,
samples, aliquots, containers, container types, sample movements
and container movements (see model in Supplementary Material:
SD—2).

2.2 Web application (interface)

The database is managed through a web-enabled graphical user
interface developed with Oracle Forms Builder and using Oracle
J Initiator plug-in.

The interface, platform independent, is compatible with most of
the current web browsers. The conﬁguration of the interface is user-
and group of user-dependent: it is dynamically and automatically
adapted to the user depending on his role and permissions.

The system enables the monitoring of the samples and their
position in the hierarchy of containers as well as of the history of
the movements from retrieval to extraction, aliquoting or shipment
to in-house or external analytical platforms. The main features are
as follows:

0 Data insertion through forms or pre-formatted csv ﬁles that
are checked by a PL/SQL procedure that surveys both data
format and data integrity with respect to the requirements of
the database. Data are parsed, stored in a temporary table and
only transferred in the corresponding permanent tables if no
errors are found. As for the performance of the imports, the
system has been optimized to be able to check 6000 samples
for 10 ﬁelds in about 5 min.

0 Retrieval of information based on a large set of search criteria,
generating either tables, Excel ﬁles or other types of reports.

0 Storage of sample or container movements: the system not
only retrieves and modiﬁes automatically the positions but also
updates the status of the initial and new containers.

0 Automatic and instant barcode printing: the system is linked
to linear and 2-dimensional barcode printers via a speciﬁc
procedure and calling of a shell script. It enables selection
of lists of barcodes to print and speciﬁcation of format
(Supplementary Material: SD-3).

0 Automatic sending of e-mails to users and managers in case of
errors during data imports or other problems.

A user-friendly and intuitive interface enables to access the different
functions and to navigate within the forms and their multiple tabs.
Each form has at least three tabs: one or two for adding information,
one for searches and one for listing the results of queries.

Users are guided while navigating within the interface thanks to
‘restrictive’ forms that prompt them to ﬁll the required ﬁelds and
that restrict values with pull-down menus, in order to minimize
form—ﬁlling errors. PL/SQL form validation checks data type and
its integrity with respect to the tables in the database. Samples
and containers barcodes can be entered using scanners to avoid
miswriting. Each data modiﬁcation, addition, or update is stored
automatically in a secure ﬁeld in each table with the user name and
the date (userstamp and timestamp).

In addition, one of the key features of a reliable sample
management system is powerful reporting with easy and quick ways
of extracting information from the database. In this respect, we
developed several different options:

0 Each form has a speciﬁc tab with many search criteria. Results
of the queries can either be displayed within the interface or be
downloaded directly in Excel ﬁle (generated on the ﬂy).

0 For samples and containers, the queries list not only their
features but also their location and their movement details.

0 For containers, a function enables generation of speciﬁc
pictures for visualization of the containers’ content. The type of
picture depends on the type of containers with color codes based
on storage status (green when empty, orange when partially
ﬁlled and red when full: see Supplementary Material: SD-4).

0 In the current SMS version, pictures of containers enable
visualization of the content of the sub-containers, thus
providing the possibility of displaying two levels of contents
(Supplementary Material: SD-4 and SD-5).

0 A container tree displays all the hierarchies of containers;
navigating within the tree provides details on each container
with the possibility to directly retrieve the list of samples that
are stored in the selected container (Supplementary Material:
SD—6).

0 Graphs can be generated dynamically from data stored in the
database. Different types of graphs are directly designed in
the form’s code using Java beans based on a Java component
provided by Oracle: the FormsGraph class.

2.3 Security

Data management systems for biobanks of human specimens must
comply with strict standards for conﬁdentiality and protection of
personal data (Hansson, 2009). We therefore took particular care of
anonymizing all specimens and of controlling the database access.
First, a trigger prevents user connection from any other way than
through the Oracle forms application. Secondly, all connection
attempts are stored and unsuccessful attempts are immediately
reported to the administrators via e-mail. Then the information stored
in the database is divided into datagroups that can be speciﬁc to
a research group, a study or a substudy depending on the need to
classify or restrict access to the data. Each sample collection belongs
to one datagroup, and each user has permissions to access data for
one or more datagroups. This access is managed through the forms:
wherever the user is in the interface, visible data are restricted to his
current datagroup. However, if allowed, the user can switch from
one data group to another using a speciﬁc menu. Actions permitted
to the users are also restricted at database level, depending on their
role and their level of responsibilities. Thus, users with read-only
permissions can only navigate within the tabs for searching and
listing data.

SMS safety is also ensured by the implementation of
a combination of automatic backups of the two servers
(Supplementary Material: SD-7).

3 CONCLUSION

We have developed a freely available and platform-independent
sample management system (SMS) tailored to handle a wide variety
of biospecimens and of storage conditions within an integrated

biobank management model. While there are commercially
available systems with high performance for a speciﬁc usage
(e. g. management of tumor banks in a hospital setup), there is a lack
of ﬂexible systems capable of accommodating the wide diversity of
the collections developed by a broad-based research institute such as
IARC. Our SMS covers a large number of storage possibilities while
monitoring closely the physical constraints of the containers and
imposing strict adherence to the storage protocols (Caboux et al.,
2007).It is an essential piece for our biobank bridging annotation
database with our LIMS for high-throughput analytical workﬂows
(Voegele et al., 2007). This is the key requirement for efﬁcient
performance and correct use of this powerful material for all coming
studies.

Flexible and expandable, our SMS model provides opportunities
for continuous improvements and for integration of new features

in the future. The database on its own, adaptable to any kind of
sample collections and heterogeneous storage structures, could serve
as model for any research center’s biobank and could be managed
with any type of web interface.

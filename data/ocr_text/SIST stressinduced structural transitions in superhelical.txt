ABSTRACT

Summary: Supercoiling imposes stress on a DNA molecule that can
drive susceptible sequences into alternative non-B form structures.
This phenomenon occurs frequently in vivo and has been implicated
in biological processes, such as replication, transcription, recombin-
ation and translocation. SIST is a software package that analyzes se-
quence-dependent structural transitions in kilobase length
superhelical DNA molecules. The numerical algorithms in SIST are
based on a statistical mechanical model that calculates the equilibrium
probability of transition for each base pair in the domain. They are
extensions of the original stress-induced duplex destabilization
(SIDD) method, which analyzes stress-driven DNA strand separation.
SIST also includes algorithms to analyze B-Z transitions and cruciform
extrusion. The SIST pipeline has an option to use the DZCBtrans al-
gorithm, which analyzes the competition among these three transitions
within a superhelical domain.

mentation are freely available at https://bitbucket.org/benhamlab/sist_

1 INTRODUCTION

Negative supercoiling in DNA can drive regions with susceptible
sequences from the native B—form into alternate structures. Such
transitions lower the superhelical energy, so they become favored
at equilibrium when the stress energy they relax exceeds their
cost. As the transition relaxes superhelicity, its effect is felt
throughout the domain involved. This makes superhelical tran-
sitions globally competitive.

Several types of superhelical transitions have been shown to
occur in vitro, including local strand separations, Z-DNA, cruci-
form extrusion and others. In vivo, supercoiling is imposed by
DNA gyrases in prokaryotes, and by transcriptional activity in
all organisms. Recently, the ssDNA-seq technique has mapped
the genome-wide occurrence of in vivo alternate DNA structures
(Kouzine et al., 2013). This method found that increasing the
cellular transcriptional activity substantially increases the occur-
rence of open regions throughout the genome. These denatured
regions are accurately predicted by the SIDD algorithm.

Competing superhelical DNA structural transitions are known
to play roles in important biological processes. The c—myc onco-
gene has a SIDD site called FUSE located 2 kb upstream from its
promoters, three AluI fragments containing Z-forming sites and

a potentially either G—quadriplex forming or H—forming site
called the CT element lkb upstream from the promoters.
Experiments have shown that each of these sites can be driven
into their alternate structure by the superhelicity that is induced
by transcription. (See Zhabinskaya and Benham, 2012) and ref-
erences therein.) Cruciforms have been implicated in chromo-
somal translocations. (See Zhabinskaya and Benham, 2013 and
references therein.)

The algorithms that underlie SIST can include any transition
whose energetics have been experimentally evaluated. At present,
there are only three such transitions: strand separation, B—Z tran-
sitions and cruciform extrusion. Other conformations that DNA
can assume include the G—quadriplex and the H—form triplex, but
their energetics are not yet fully characterized. However, the
SIST algorithms are written to permit the inclusion of additional
types of transitions into the model, as more experimental infor-
mation about their energetics becomes available.

2 ALGORITHMS
2.1 Model

We use a statistical mechanical model to calculate the equilib-
rium conformational properties of a superhelical DNA. We
examine individual states in which each base pair is either in
B-form or in any one of the alternate conformations to which
it is susceptible. If there are m conformations being considered
(including the B-form) in a domain of N susceptible base pairs,
there will be mN states. Because calculations that include all
states are computationally impractical, we exclude the high
energy states that are not signiﬁcantly occupied at equilibrium.
This improves execution time while preserving the accuracy of
the results. A description of the statistical mechanical model used
and its algorithmic implementation have been presented else-
where (F ye and Benham, 1999; Zhabinskaya and Benham, 2013).

The energetics of each type of transition depend strongly on
the base sequence. Strand separation is easiest in Arich regions,
whereas Z—form prefers CG—dinucleotide repeats and cruciform
extrusion requires a high degree of inverted repeat symmetry.
Deviations from these sequence preferences are energetically
costly, so transitions at imperfect sites will have low probabilities
at equilibrium.

2.2 Codes

The SIST software package includes two C codes, called trans_
three and trans_c0mpete. T rans_three allows the user to investi-
gate each of the three types of transition (strand separation,
Z—form and cruciform) individually, whereas trans_compete
considers competitions among all three.

To analyze cruciform extrusion, the sequence first needs to be
scanned for inverted repeat sequences (IRs). Both perfect IRs
and ones containing imperfections such as bulges or mismatches
should be treated, and they may have a range of arm and loop
lengths. We use the inverted repeats ﬁnder (IRF) algorithm for
this purpose WVarburton et al., 2004), downloadable from http://
tandem.bu.edu/irf/irf.download.html). The parameters used in
this search and the free energies that are assigned to the IRs
are described in Zhabinskaya and Benham (2013). Within
SIST, the IR _finder.pl code runs the IRF algorithm, converts
the sequence into an appropriate format and assigns energies
to each IR found by the IRF. It treats circular molecules differ-
ently from linear ones to assure that IRs that span the junction
between the start and end of the sequence are included. The
output of IR _finder.pl is a string of IR starts and lengths, and
extrusion energies for every arm length up to full extrusion. This
is necessary because extrusion can halt at any point, owing to
either imperfections or full relaxation. These results are used as
input to the C codes that analyze extrusion probabilities.

The masterpl code implements a pipeline in which the user
specifies the type of analysis to be done, and the ﬁle that contains
the DNA sequence. Some of the optional parameters include
superhelical density (default: a = —0.06), temperature (default:
T = 310K), ionic strength (default: x = 0.01 M) and molecular
type: linear (default) or circular. The user can choose the output
to list model parameters, a set of ensemble average parameter
values, and the probabilities of the selected transition (or of all
three transitions for trans_c0mpete) for each base pair in the
sequence.

As an example we use the three-way competition algorithm
(trans_c0mpete) to analyze an illustrative DNA sequence that
was constructed by inserting three sites into the pBR322 plasmid.
These are as follows: a site susceptible to strand separation (40
bp of A’s), a Z—susceptible site (10 CG dinucleotides) and a per-
fect IR with a 4bp loop and 22 bp arms. When we run trans_—
compete using default parameters, it provides the output
probabilities shown in Figure 1. Although pbr322 contains
innate melting and Z-form regions (Zhabinskaya and Benham,
2011), the three inserted regions dominate the competition at this
level of superhelicity, as seen by the three peak in Figure 1.

We recommend using trans_c0mpete when analyzing super-
helical transitions, because studying each transition separately
can overrepresent its occurrence by excluding the competition
with the other types. Examples have shown that in some cases
the probability of a specific transition can change from unity
when studied separately to nearly zero when competition is con-
sidered (Zhabinskaya and Benham, 2013). However, studying
the transitions independently might provide useful information
about which regions in a genome are susceptible to each type of
transition.

Fig. 1. Transition probabilities calculated by SIST as functions of base
pair position are shown for a sequence where regions susceptible to melt-
ing, Z—DNA and cruciform extrusion were inserted into the pbr322 plas-
mid. The results are shown for the three-way competition algorithm
(trans_compete) run with default parameters. The sequence and instruc-
tions on how to generate these results can be found in the example
directory in the Bitbucket repository

form alternate structures under a variety of environmental condi-
tions. Users can access the SIST source code through Bitbucket,
which will enable them to extend the method to suit their evolving
needs. They may, for example, include other transitions or update
energy parameters with new experimental evidence.

In the near future, we plan also to release our windowing al-
gorithm. This will allow users to analyze long sequences, includ-
ing complete chromosomes.

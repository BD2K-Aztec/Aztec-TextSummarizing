ABSTRACT

Motivation: Public genomic databases, which are often used to
guide genetic studies of human disease, are now being applied
to genomic medicine through in silico integrative genomics. These
databases, however, often lack tools for systematically determining
the experimental origins of the data.

Results: We introduce a new data provenance model that we have
implemented in a public web application, BioQ, for assessing the
reliability of the data by systematically tracing its experimental origins
to the original subjects and biologics. BioQ allows investigators to
both visualize data provenance as well as explore individual elements
of experimental process flow using precise tools for detailed data
exploration and documentation. It includes a number of human
genetic variation databases such as the HapMap and 1000 Genomes
projects.

Availability and implementation: BioQ is freely available to the
public at http://bioq.saclab.net

Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at
Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The rapid expansion of biotechnology continues to drive the
public availability of massive, complex genomic databases. These
databases are often used in applications of in silico integrative
genomics to genetic studies of human disease (Hawkins et al.,
2010; Hirschhorn, 2009) as well as genomic medicine (Green et al.,
2011). It is therefore critical for investigators to have tools for
systematically assessing the credibility of the data (Baggerly, 2010).

We have developed a straightforward model for tracing
experimental process ﬂow in genomic databases. The goal is
to isolate the key entities in the database—the biologics, the
experiments and the experimental results—and to express their
relationships in terms of experimental process ﬂow. We call this the
Biologic—Experiment—Result (BERT) model and have implemented
this model in our BioQ web application (http://bioq.saclab.net).
BioQ builds on our dbSNP—Q application (Saccone et al., 2011)
to allow investigators to visualize experimental process ﬂow and
retrieve process—related data with powerful query tools.

2 TRACING EXPERIMENTAL PROCESS FLOW

Figure 1 shows an application of the BERT model, as implemented
in BioQ, to allele frequency data from the 1000 Genomes Project
(Durbin et al., 2010) (see Supplementary Figs S1 and S2 for
additional examples). These estimates, which are a key experimental
result in the 1000 Genomes database, can be clearly traced back
through speciﬁc processes, such as the methods and software
applied to the original 1000 Genomes data ﬁles, to detailed
information on the subjects and their biologics, including data on
pedigree structure and DNA extraction from the Coriell Institute
(http://ccr.coriell.org). In BioQ these process ﬂow diagrams are fully
interactive. Each node in Figure l, which is taken directly from BioQ
(http://tinyurl.com/75rluj j), is linked to detailed documentation and
powerful data query tools (see Supplementary Figs S3 and S4).

Process ﬂow diagrams should ideally include information on
diagnostics and quality control (QC). Our application to the
HapMap and 1000 Genomes projects, for example, includes detailed
results from our own QC analyses including sample— and marker—
speciﬁc call rates, tests of Mendelian errors and Hardy—Weinberg
equilibrium (see the Supplementary Materials for details). In
particular, when developing tables related to Mendelian errors in
the HapMap (Altshuler et al., 2010) Phase 111 Release 111 database
we discovered a familial misspeciﬁcation in the HapMap data
ﬁles. The details are described in the BioQ documentation for
the table summary_samples (http://tinyurl.com/7q50f5e) (see the
Supplementary Materials for details).

Clearly there will be some genomic databases of interest to
geneticists that lack data on experimental origins. BioQ, for
example, includes the NHGRI genome—wide association study
(GWAS) database (Hindorff et al., 2009). The NHGRI database
contains the top association results from published GWAS. It
does not, however, include detailed data on QC measures for
individual association results, although links to publications are
provided as indicated by the BioQ documentation for this database
(http://tinyurl.com/7ztufdg). BioQ uses the BERT model to clearly
and systematically show when experimental results are not traceable
to subjects and biologics and when QC data is lacking (see
Supplementary Figs SS and S6).

3 DISCUSSION

The goal of the BERT data provenance model is to provide
investigators with a practical means of systematically establishing a
reasonable level of credibility when using genomic databases. Our
BioQ web application implements this model in a highly transparent

Fig. 1. How the BERT model is used to trace experimental process ﬂow back to the original samples and biologics for allele frequency estimates in the ASW
population (African Americans in the Southwestern USA) from the October 2011 Release of the 1000 Genomes Project. The double rectangles represent
groups of tables that may be input or output for the various processes and experiments (represented by ovals) in the database; these are referred to as ﬂow
groups. Processes that yield key experimental results in the database are designated as Experiments and labeled  Tables in the database are represented
by simple rectangles. Tables containing data on subjects, biologics and key experimental results are indicated by the labels ‘S’, ‘B’ and ‘R’, respectively. The
goal is to trace the results back to subjects and biologics. Some groups and individual tables contain auxiliary reference data for processes and ﬂow groups,
respectively; reference nodes are indicated by dashed lines. See the Supplementary Materials for addition information on the BERT model.

way with numerous tools for data retrieval. Other models, such
as FuGE (Jones et al., 2007), are more appropriate for capturing
the full spectrum of experimental detail. The relative simplicity
of the BERT model will allow applications such as BioQ to adapt
as the requirements of investigators evolve.

Very few tools allow investigators to trace the experimental source
of genomic data and to assess QC in detail as in BioQ. Without
tools such as BioQ these undertakings can take days, even weeks
given the enormity of tests required to thoroughly assess QC, the
sheer size of the datasets involved and the difﬁculty in locating
provenance data. It is therefore likely that in many cases these
assessments will not be done, and this may lead to the use of faulty
data. A recent incident at Duke University (Samuel Reich, 2011), for
example, involving the use of ﬂawed data in a translational genomic
study has led to the creation of a new framework at Duke on the
quality of translational genomic medicine in which data provenance
plays a minor role (http://tinyurl.com/6pkfdgd, accessed March 19,
2012).

BioQ is a direct extension of our previous web application
dbSNP—Q (Saccone et al., 2011). While dbSNP—Q provides powerful
query and documentation tools for the dbSNP database, it does
not implement the BERT model. These methods and tools for
systematically tracing experimental process ﬂow are unique to BioQ.
Resources such as the UCSC database (Fujita et al., 2011) focus
on graphical representations of genomic data. These resources do
not provide tools for systematically tracing experimental process
ﬂow and for querying the underlying relational databases in a web

browser as in BioQ. The BERT model and the BioQ application
are designed to complement these resources by providing tools for
systematically determining the origins of and assessing the quality
of the data used in other tools such as the UCSC genome browser.

The ability to establish the experimental origins of genomic data
and to systematically assess QC at all stages of the experimental
process is a systemic issue relevant to all genomic applications. It is
therefore useful to have a separate resource dedicated to resolving
this issue that can be used in conjunction with other applications.
As new bioinformatics applications emerge that further bridge the
gap between genomics and medicine, the availability of tools for
systematically determining experimental origins will be crucial for
maintaining reasonable levels of credibility.

The BioQ project has taken a number of measures to ensure
that updates to external genomic databases are incorporated
punctually and accurately. To each database there corresponds
a custom command—line driven program, written in Perl, that
downloads the data, processes it, checks for errors, performs
QC analyses and creates the MySQL databases used in BioQ.
Barring any major changes to the formats released by these
databases, these programs allow the BioQ update process to
be completely automated. All code is publicly available from
our Subversion server (http://svn.saclab.net) and our code review
resource (http://ﬁsheye.saclab.net). These programs can be easily
modiﬁed to accommodate any changes encountered in updates to
external genomic databases and will be used to incorporate these
updates as they become available.

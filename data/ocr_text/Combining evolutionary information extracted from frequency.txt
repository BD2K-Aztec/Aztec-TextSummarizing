ABSTRACT

Motivation: Owing to its importance in both basic research (such as
molecular evolution and protein attribute prediction) and practical ap-
plication (such as timely modeling the 3D structures of proteins tar-
geted for drug development), protein remote homology detection has
attracted a great deal of interest. It is intriguing to note that the profile-
based approach is promising and holds high potential in this regard.
To further improve protein remote homology detection, a key step is
how to find an optimal means to extract the evolutionary information
into the profiles.

Results: Here, we propose a novel approach, the so-called profile-
based protein representation, to extract the evolutionary information
via the frequency profiles. The latter can be calculated from the
multiple sequence alignments generated by PSI-BLAST. Three top
performing sequence-based kernels (SVM-Ngram, SVM-pairwise
and SVM-LA) were combined with the profile-based protein represen-
tation. Various tests were conducted on a SCOP benchmark dataset
that contains 54 families and 23 superfamilies. The results showed that
the new approach is promising, and can obviously improve the
performance of the three kernels. Furthermore, our approach can
also provide useful insights for studying the features of proteins in
various families. It has not escaped our notice that the current
approach can be easily combined with the existing sequence-based
methods so as to improve their performance as well.

learning was also provided at

1 INTRODUCTION

By March 2013, 89 003 experimentally determined protein struc-
tures were deposited in the Protein Data Bank (Berman et al.,
2007). However, this number is only about one-sixth of 539 616,
the number of protein sequences held in the UniProtKB/Swiss—
Prot database (Wu et al., 2006). To timely use such vast amount
of structure-unknown protein sequences for basic research and
drug development, it is highly desired to determine their 3D
structures and functions by means of homology approaches
(Chou, 2004). Unfortunately, protein remote homology detec-
tion is still a challenging problem in bioinformatics.

The early methods in dealing with this problem were based on
the pairwise sequence comparison approaches, such as BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1990) and Smith—Waterman local alignment
algorithm (Smith and Waterman, 1981). However, in many
cases, this kind of sequence alignment method failed to detect
remote homologies due to the low sequence similarities. Later
methods to challenge this problem were based on the generative
models to induce a probability distribution over the protein
family, and then to generate the unknown proteins as new
members of the family from the stochastic model. For example,
the hidden Markov model (HMM) (Karplus et al., 1998) can be
trained iteratively in a semi-supervised manner by using both
positively labeled and unlabeled samples of a particular family
to generate the positive set (Qian and Goldstein, 2004).

Recently, the discriminative methods, such as support vector
machine (SVM) (Vapnik, 1998), were used to address this problem
by focusing on the differences between protein families. The key of
the SVM methods is the kernel function by which to compute the
inner product between two samples in the feature space. The most
straightforward approach to generate the kernels was based on the
features extracted from protein sequences. SVM-Ngram (Dong
et al., 2006), SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003) and SVM-LA
(Saigo et al., 2004) were three of the most successful sequence-
based kernels. SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006) was based on the
feature space that contains all short subsequence of length N. In
SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003), a protein sequence was
represented as a vector of pairwise similarities to all protein

sequences in the training set, and then inner product between these
vector-space representations was taken as the kernel. SVM-LA
(Saigo et al., 2004) measured the similarity between a pair of pro-
teins by taking all the optimal local alignment scores with gaps
between all possible subsequences into account. Besides these ker-
nels, several other sequence-based kernels were also proposed,
such as Mismatch (Leslie et al., 2004) and SVM-BALSA
(\Nebb-Robertson et al., 2005). The proﬁle-based kernels could
further improve the performance by using the evolutional infor-
mation extracted from the proﬁles. For example, Top-n-grams
(Liu et al., 2008) extracted the proﬁle-based patterns by consider-
ing the most frequent elements in the proﬁles; proﬁle kernel
(Kuang et al., 2005) extracted the short substrings according to
the proﬁle-based ungapped alignment scores; some proﬁle-based
methods improved the predictive performance by developing
more sensitive proﬁles. HHsearch method (S6ding, 2005) was
based on a novel proﬁle using the HMM. In COMPASS
(Sadreyev et al., 2009), numerical proﬁles were generated to con-
struct optimal proﬁle—proﬁle alignments and to estimate the stat-
istical signiﬁcance of the corresponding alignment scores.

In the meantime, some other features and techniques have
been applied to this ﬁeld to further improve the predictive per-
formance. For instance, the kernel combination methodology
(VBKC) (Damoulas and Girolami, 2008) used a single multi-
class kernel machine to combine various kernels based on differ-
ent feature spaces; SVM-physicochemical distance transform-
ation (PDT) (Liu et al., 2012) combined the amino acid
physicochemical properties and the proﬁle features Via PDT to
incorporate the local sequence-order information of the entire
protein sequences. Also, based on the similarities between pro-
tein sequences and natural languages, the natural language pro-
cessing techniques were applied to this ﬁeld. It was shown that
the performance of building-block-based methods could be im-
proved by using the latent semantic analysis (LSA) (Dong et al.,
2006). Moreover, PROTEMBED (Melvin et al., 2011) detected pro-
tein remote homology by embedding protein sequences into a
low-dimensional semantic space.

As we can see from the aforementioned introduction, most of
the top-performing methods were developed based on the fea-
tures extracted from proﬁles. This is consistent with the fact that
a proﬁle is much richer than an individual sequence in encoding
information. Also, biology is a natural science with historic
dimension. All biological species have developed beginning
from a limited number of ancestral species. It is true for protein
sequence as well (Chou, 2004). Their evolution involves changes
of single residues, insertions and deletions of several residues,
gene doubling and gene fusion (Chou, 1995). With these changes
accumulated for a long period, many similarities between initial
and resultant amino acid sequences are gradually eliminated, but
the corresponding proteins may still share many common fea-
tures, such as having basically the same biological function
(Loewenstein et al., 2009), folding topology, subcellular location
and other attributes (Chou, 2013).

Accordingly, the key to improve the performance of these
methods is to ﬁnd a suitable approach to extract the evolutionary
information from the proﬁles. In View of this, the current study
was initiated in an attempt to propose a proﬁle-based protein
representation by extracting the evolutionary information from
the frequency proﬁles.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

As shown by a series of publications (Chen et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2009;
Xiao et al., 2013; Xu et al., 2013) and summarized in a comprehensive
review (Chou, 2011), to develop a useful statistical prediction method or
model for a biological system, one needs to engage the following proced-
ures: (i) construct or select a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the
predictor; (ii) formulate the samples with an effective mathematical
expression that can truly reﬂect their intrinsic correlation with the target
to be predicted; (iii) introduce or develop a powerful algorithm (or engine)
to operate the prediction; (iv) properly perform cross-validation tests
to objectively evaluate the anticipated accuracy of the predictor; and
(V) provide the downloadable source code or a web-server for the predic-
tion method. Below, let us describe how to deal these procedures.

2.1 SCOP benchmark

Suppose § is a remote homology system investigated in the current study
that contains 4352 protein sequences, which were taken from (Liao and
Noble, 2003) at http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/svm-pairwise/. These
proteins were selected from SCOP version 1.53 and extracted from the
Astral database (Brenner et al., 2000). None of the 4352 proteins has
sequence pairwise similarity to any other with higher than 10‘25 in the
E-Value [for more about the E-Value and its implication in reducing hom-
ology bias and redundancy, see (Brenner et al., 2000)]. These proteins
were also used by others (Dong et al., 2006; Lingner and Meinicke, 2006;
Saigo et al., 2004) to study remote homology detection. The 4352 proteins
in § can be classiﬁed into 853 superfamilies and 1356 families; i.e.

s = stsEU - - - U§§53 = siUsQU - - - Usi356 (1)

where §f(i = 1, 2, ..., 853) is the ith superfamily, $2 (k = 1, 2, ...,1356)
is the kth family and the symbol U represents the ‘union’ in the set theory.
For readers” convenience, the codes of the 4352 proteins and their
sequence as well as the attributes of their families and superfamilies
are given in Supplementary Material S1.

Because some families and superfamilies in § do not contain signiﬁ-
cant number of protein sequences, and also because the negative dataset
for each protein family can be any proteins except those belonging to its
own superfamily, it is not so straightforward but a little more complicated
and subtle for how to select protein samples from § to deﬁne the training
and testing datasets. To provide a clear description, let us consider a
different manner to address this. As demonstrated by many previous
studies on a series of important biological topics, such as enzyme-
catalyzed reactions (Zhou and Deng, 1984), inhibition of human
immunodeﬁciency Virus-1 reverse transcriptase (Althaus et al., 1993),
drug metabolism systems (Chou, 2010) and applying wenxiang diagram
or graph (Chou et al., 2011) to study protein—protein interactions (Zhou,
2011; Zhou and Huang, 2013), using graphical approaches to study com-
plicated problems can provide an intuitive picture and useful insights for
in-depth studying and analyzing various complicated relations in these
systems (Lin and Lapointe, 2013). In View of this, let us also use graphic
approach to describe the feature and relation of the families and super-
families in §, as shown in Figure 1, where the open circles denote the
families or superfamilies that have signiﬁcant number of protein se-
quences and the gray circles denote those that do not.

Of the 1356 families in § (cf. Equation 1), 54 contain signiﬁcant
number of proteins (see the third row of Fig. 1) and form a target

Thus, we have

each of the three contains 857, 1508 and 4352 proteins, respectively.

Now, for each of the 54 families in the target family set §targep we can
deﬁne a training dataset and testing dataset given by

where the positive training dataset SgainUc) contains at least 10 of its
superfamily members, none of which belongs to the kth family, and the
positive testing dataset Sjgsﬂc) contains at least ﬁve protein domains
within the family. The proteins in the negative training and testing data-
sets, St‘rain(k) and St‘est(k), were picked from § by excluding the superfam-
ily of the kth family and randomly split between the two in the same ratio
as the positive ones. The 54 training and testing datasets thus obtained

are given in the Supplementary Materials S2 and S3, respectively.

2.2 Protein frequency proﬁle

The frequency proﬁle M for protein P with L amino acids can be repre-
sented by

mm m1,2 ' ' ' mu.
m2,1 m2,2 ' ' ' m2,L

M = . . . . (6)
m m m

20, l 20, 2 20, L

where 20 is the total number of standard amino acids; my (0 5 my: 1)
is the target frequency, which reﬂects the probability of amino acid 1'
(i = 1,2, . . . ,20) occurring at the sequence position j (j = 1,2, . . . ,L) in pro-
tein P during evolutionary processes. For each column in M, the elements
add up to 1.

The target frequency is calculated from the multiple sequence align-
ments generated by running PSI-BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997) against
the NCBI’s NR with default parameters except that the number of
iterations was not set at 1 but was set at 10 in the current study. The
target frequency of amino acid 1' in sequence position j is calculated as:

ml” 2 (“ﬂy + ﬂgij) (7)
(0! + ,3)
where fij is the observed frequency of amino acid 1' in column j; ,8 is a free
parameter set to a constant value of 10, which is initially used by PSI-
BLAST; at is the number of different amino acids in column j — 1; and gy-
is the pseudo-count for amino acid iin protein sequence position j, which
can be calculated as:
20

g.)- = 2% (8)

k=1 pk

where pk is the background frequency of amino acid k, and qik is the
score of amino acid 1' being aligned to amino acid k in BLOSUM62
substitution matrix, which is the default score matrix of PSI-BLAST
(Altschul et al., 1997).

2.3 Proﬁle-based protein representation

Although the methods by using amino acid sequence information achieve
certain degree of success, only using sequence information cannot accur-
ately detect protein remote homology. Recent studies demonstrated that
the proﬁle-based methods would show better performance because a pro-
ﬁle is richer than an individual sequence as far as the encoding informa-
tion is concerned. However, a proﬁle is a 2D matrix, whereas a protein
sequence is an amino acid string. Therefore, the 2D evolutionary proﬁle
information cannot be directly incorporated into the sequence-based
methods for prediction. To deal with this problem, we propose an
approach to convert the frequency proﬁles into a series of proﬁle-based
proteins. Thus, the existing sequence-based methods can be directly
performed on these proteins for the prediction. The target frequencies
in the frequency proﬁles reﬂect the probabilities of the corresponding
amino acids appearing in the speciﬁc sequence positions. The higher
the frequency is, the more likely the corresponding amino acid occurs.
It is reasonable to use the nth most frequent amino acids in the frequency
proﬁles to represent the protein sequences. Below is the description on
how to convert frequency proﬁles into proﬁle-based proteins.

Given the frequency proﬁle M for protein P (Equation 6), we can
sort the amino acids in each column according to a descending order.
The frequency proﬁle thus obtained by the sorting operation is called
the sorted frequency proﬁle and denoted by M’. For each row in M’,
the amino acids are combined to produce the proﬁle-based protein.
By following this approach, the frequency proﬁle M is converted into
20 proﬁle-based proteins p1, p2,..., p20 (Supplementary Fig. S1 in
Supplementary Material S4), which contain the evolutionary information
in the frequency proﬁle. These 20 proteins have different importance.
During evolutionary process, protein P is preferred to transform into
p1, but not preferred to transform into p20. For reader’s convenience,
the source code for generating the proﬁle-based proteins is accessible by
clicking the link at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/main/~binliu/
remote/.

2.4 Sequence-based kernels

Three state-of—the-art sequence-based kernels [SVM-N gram (Dong et al.,
2006), SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003) and SVM-LA (Saigo et al.,
2004)] were used to validate whether the proposed approach could
improve their performance.

In SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006) method, the Ngrams were the set
of all possible subsequences of amino acids of a ﬁxed length. A protein
sequence was mapped to a feature vector by the occurrence frequency of
each Ngram. The value of N was set at 3 as suggested by the authors
(Dong et al., 2006), and therefore the dimension of the vector is 8000. At
the heart of the SVM is a kernel function that acts as a similarity score
between pairs of vectors. The kernel was normalized so that each vector
had length 1 in the feature space:

X-Y
«(X-XXY- Y)

where X and Y are two proteins in the dataset. This normalized step was
also used by SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003) and SVM-LA (Saigo
et al., 2004). The normalized kernel thus obtained was then transformed
into a radial basis kernel.

In the SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003) method, the feature
vector was a list of pairwise sequence similarity scores, computed with
respect to all of the sequences in the training set. The radial basis function

mxn= m

was used as the kernel. The rest steps were the same as the ones used in
SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006).

In the SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004), the kernel was calculated by
summing up scores obtained from the local alignments with gaps between
the two sequences, computed by Smith—Waterman dynamic program-
ming algorithm. Such kernel might not be a positive deﬁnite kernel and
the authors (Saigo et al., 2004) provided two solutions for this problem.
Owing to its performance and simplicity, we implemented one of the two
methods, namely, the LA-ekm kernel. The parameters of LA-ekm kernel
took the optimal values (,8: 0.5, d: —11, e: —4).

2.5 Multiple kernel learning

The kernel described in the previous section can be used by kernel meth-
ods to train the SVM classiﬁer. Each kernel contains different discrim-
inative information, and therefore combining the kernels automatically is
a promising way to improve the performance. In machine learning ﬁeld,
this approach is called multiple kernel learning (MKL) (Cortes et al.,
2010; Varma and Babu, 2009), which has attracted a lot of attention
recently. The MKL technique aimed to combine different kernels to im-
prove the performance, and showed the state-of—the—art results on image
classiﬁcation ﬁeld (V arma and Babu, 2009). In this article, we focused on
the weighted linear combination of kernels. The weight of each kernel can
be optimized based on different criterion, which can be categorized by
two groups. One group is the one-stage kernel learning methods, which
optimize the weight and the SVM objective function simultaneously
(Varma and Babu, 2009). These methods suffer from the high training
complexity. The other group is two-stage kernel learning methods, which
optimize the weight by using a criterion ﬁrst and then train the SVM
classiﬁer using the kernel combined by the learned weight of each kernel.
Compared with one-stage learning methods, the two-stage kernel learning
methods showed better performance with reduced training cost.
Therefore, in this study, we adopted the two-stage kernel learning
method. Speciﬁcally, the kernel target alignment (KTA) objective
function was used to optimize the weight of each kernel, which showed
theoretical guarantees and can improve the performance in practice
(Cortes et al., 2010; Varma and Babu, 2009).

Given m training samples x1, x2, . . . , xm and their corresponding labels
y1, y2, . . . , ym, the ideal kernel matrix can be formulated as KyzyTy,
where y is the vector of labels [121, 322, . . . , ym]. For the given 11 kernels
K1, K2, . . .Kn, the aim is to learn the weight of each kernel. To avoid the
kernel scaling problem, we center kernel Kk and the corresponding ideal
kernel Ky in feature space by the following equation:

1 m l m
ch(xi9 39') = Kk(Xi, Xj) — Q  Kk(Xi, Xj) — Q  Kk(Xi, 39')

1 m (10)
+ —2 Z Kk(xis 39')
m 1,121
where ch is normalized by:
KC i9 '
K206i, ,9.) 2 W (11)
Z ch (xi: 

1:1
Following the above steps, each kernel is normalized, and then these
11 kernels are linearly combined by the following equation:

I(Comb = Z WkKIC 

k=1

where wk (0 5 wk 5 1, 22:1 wk 2 1) is the weight of kernel K2.

The weight is learned by KTA objective function, which maximizes the

alignment between Keomb and the centered ideal kernel Key.
I(Comb ' Key

\/(KComb ' KComb) X (Key ' Key)

 

I0(KCOmb9 Key) = 

 

This leads to a quadratic program problem and can be solved quite efﬁ-
ciently. For implementation details, please refer to (Cortes et al., 2010).

In this study, three kernels (KP, Kpl and [(1,2) for each selected
sequence-based method were linearly combined by using the above
KTA approach to further improve the performance. For reader’s con-
venience, the source code of the MKL is accessible by clicking the link
at http://bioinformatics.hitsz.edu.cn/main/~ binliu/remote/ .

2.6 SVM

SVM is a class of supervised learning algorithms ﬁrst introduced by
Vapnik (1998). SVM-based machine learning algorithm has been success-
fully used to investigate various problems in molecular biology, such as
identifying DNA recombination spots (Chen et al., 2013), membrane
protein types (Cai et al., 2003) and heat-shock protein functions (Feng
et al., 2013), among many others. In this study, the publicly available Gist
SVM package (http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/gist/) was used.

2.7 Evaluation methodology

Because the test sets have many more negative than positive samples,
simply measuring error-rates will not give a good evaluation of perform-
ance. For the cases in which the positive and negative samples are not
evenly distributed, the best way to evaluate the trade-off between the
speciﬁcity and sensitivity is to use a receiver operating characteristic
(ROC) score (Gribskov and Robinson, 1996). An ROC score is the
normalized area under a curve that plots true positives against false posi-
tives for different classiﬁcation thresholds. A score of 1 means perfect
separation of positive samples from negative ones, whereas a score of
0 means that none of the sequences selected by the algorithm is positive.
Another performance measure is ROC50 score, which is the area under
the ROC curve up to the ﬁrst 50 false positives.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 Proﬁle-based protein representation can improve the
performance of methods based on sequence
composition

The frequency proﬁle of a protein P can be converted into 20
proﬁle-based proteins (p1, p2, . . ., p20) by using the proposed
approach (see Section 2 for details). These 20 proteins have
different importance. p1 is the most important protein, as it is
the combination of the top frequent amino acids in frequency
proﬁle, whereas p20 is the proﬁle-based protein to which protein
P is the most unlikely to convert because it is the combination
of the amino acids with lowest frequencies in frequency proﬁle.
If all the 20 proﬁle-based proteins are used in the prediction,
the computational cost is relatively high. In this study, only the
top n most important proﬁle-based proteins (p1, . . ., pn) were
used in the prediction. To select the value of n, the following
experiment was conducted. The frequencies of 20 standard
amino acids in each column of a frequency proﬁles add up
to 1. Therefore, the average frequency is 0.05 (1/20=0.05).
If an amino acid with frequency >0.05, it is likely to occur
during evolutionary process; otherwise, it is not likely to occur.
The percentage of the amino acids with frequencies >0.05 in each
proﬁle-based protein on the SCOP benchmark was calculated,
and the results are shown in Figure 2. As we can see from the
ﬁgure, such amino acids are abundant in proﬁle-based proteins
p1, p2 and p3 (99.99%, 99.60% and 98.13%, respectively), but
for the other 17 proﬁle-based proteins, the percentage decreases

signiﬁcantly (from 89.28 to 0%). Therefore, in this study, only
the top three proﬁle-based proteins were used in the prediction.
These proﬁle-based proteins were combined with three state-of-
the-art methods based on sequence composition, including
SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006), SVM-pairwise (Liao and
Noble, 2003) and SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004), and the results
are shown in Supplementary Table S1 of Supplementary
Material S4. For each of the three methods, the best performance
was achieved for the top important protein p1. Compared with
the methods performed on the raw protein sequence P, the
performance of the proposed methods can be improved by
3.7~7.5% and 9.6~13.7% in terms of average ROC and
ROC50 scores, respectively, indicating that the proposed pro-
ﬁle-based protein representation is useful for protein remote
homology detection. The performance of the methods performed
on p2 is similar as that of the methods performed on the raw
protein P. The predictive results of the methods performed on p3
were the lowest. These results are consistent with the different
importance of the three proﬁle-based proteins p1, p2 and p3.

3.2 Comparison with closely related methods

Besides the current method, there are some other methods for
predicting protein remote homologies based on proﬁles, such
as SVM-Top-n-gram—combine—LSA (Liu et al., 2008), SVM-
PDT-Proﬁle (Liu et al., 2012), Proﬁle (Kuang et al., 2005),
BioSVM-2L (Muda et al., 2011) and HHSearch (S6ding,
2005). SVM-Top-n—gram-combine-LSA (Liu et al., 2008)
extracted the building blocks of proteins from the frequency pro-
ﬁles, which could be treated as the ‘words’ of protein language.
The LSA (Dong et al., 2006) was applied to further improve the
performance of this method. SVM-PDT-Proﬁle (Liu et al., 2012)
combined the amino acid physicochemical properties in the
Amino Acid Index (AAIndex) (Kawashima et al., 2008) with
the frequency proﬁles for the prediction. The feature vector of
Proﬁle method (Kuang et al., 2005) was constructed by the short
subsequences whose PSSM-based ungapped alignment score was

above a predeﬁned threshold. BioSVM-2L constructed two-layer
SVM classiﬁers with proﬁle-based kernels (Muda et al., 2011).
All the above three methods were based on SVM, and the dif-
ference among them was in the extracted features. HHSearch
(S6ding, 2005) was one of the best protein remote homology
detection methods, which used a novel proﬁle-based HMM.
The results obtained by these four methods on the SCOP bench-
mark are listed in Supplementary Table S1 of Supplementary
Material S4, from which we can see that the current method
outperforms SVM-Top-n—gram—combine—LSA (Liu et al., 2008),
SVM-PDT-Proﬁle (Liu et al., 2012) and BioSVM-2L (Muda
et al., 2011) and is highly comparable with Proﬁle (Kuang
et al., 2005) and HHSearch (S6ding, 2005), indicating that the
proﬁle-based protein representation is a promising approach to
extract the evolutionary information from frequency proﬁles for
protein remote homology detection.

3.3 Combining different methods via MKL

As mentioned above, the approaches based on the top two
proﬁle-based proteins p1, p2 and the raw protein P are among
the top performing methods. It is interesting to investigate
whether these methods can be combined to further improve
the performance. In this study, the MKL framework was used
to combine these methods. The KTA method was used to auto-
matically optimize the weight of each kernel on the training set,
and then these kernels are combined with weights into a single
kernel for the SVM-based prediction. The results are shown in
Supplementary Table S2 of Supplementary Material S4 as well
as Supplementary Materials S5—S7. The MKL approach can
improve the performance of SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006),
but only has minor impact on the SVM-pairwise (Liao and
Noble, 2003) and SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004). To uncover
the reason, the weight of each kernel was analyzed. For each
kernel, the average weight on all the 54 protein families is
shown in Supplementary Table S2 of Supplementary
Material S4. For these three methods, the pl-based kernel was
weighted most heavily. For SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble,
2003) and SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004), the weight values of
their corresponding P and p2 kernels are <0.1, indicating these
kernels only have minor impact on the ﬁnal results, and hence
the performance improvement is modest. VBKC (Damoulas and
Girolami, 2008) is another method based on the MKL, which
combined four string kernels: SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble,
2003), SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004), SVM-MM (Leslie et al.,
2004) and SVM-Mono (Lingner and Meinicke, 2006). Our pro-
posed SVM-pairwise-KTA and SVM-LA-KTA outperform
VBKC (Damoulas and Girolami, 2008) by 1.2~2.2% and
29.9~31.3% according to the average ROC and ROC50
scores, respectively. The obvious performance improvement is
mainly due to the proposed proﬁle-based protein representation
and MKL approach.

3.4 Correlations between discriminative power of Ngrams
and protein families

The SVM-Ngram (Dong et al., 2006) method is based on the

explicit feature space representation, which provides the possibil-

ity to measure the correlations between Ngrams and protein

families. The sequence-speciﬁc weight learnt from the SVM

Protein remote homology detection

 

training process can be used to calculate the discriminant weight
for each Ngram, which indicates the importance of the corres-
ponding Ngram. By following Lingner and Meinicke’s approach
(Lingner and Meinicke, 2008), given the weight vector of a set of
M sequences obtained from the kernel-based training process

or: [051, a2, a3, . . . , aM], the discriminant weight vector w in the
feature space can be calculated by the following equation:
w = F *0; (14)

where F is the matrix of sequence representatives. The magnitude
of the element in w represents the discriminative power of the
corresponding feature.

In most protein families, kernel p1 is weighted more heavily
than kernel P and kernel p1. Two such protein families (SCOP
ID: 2.1.1.4 and 3.2.1.5) were selected from the SCOP benchmark
for further study, and the results are shown in Supplementary
Tables S3 and S4 of Supplementary Material S4, respectively.
For each kernel, the top 10 most discriminative Ngram features
calculated by Equation 14 are shown in the tables too. For pro-
tein family 2.1.1.4, kernel P and kernel p1 share some common
most discriminative Ngrams, such as ‘mtm’, ‘yty’, ‘mtf and
‘wwf, indicating these Ngrams remain stable during evolution-
ary process and therefore these Ngrams would be the important
sequence patterns for maintaining the structure and function of
this protein family (Supplementary Table S3 of Supplementary
Material S4). However, there are a few common most discrim-
inative Ngrams between kernel P and kernel p1 in protein family
3.2.1.5. The top 10 most discriminative Ngrams of kernel p1 are
all different from those in kernel P (Supplementary Table S4 of
Supplementary Material S4). These Ngrams would contribute to
the higher discriminative power of kernel p1 for this protein
family.

Although in most cases, kernel p1 was weighted most heavily,
some exceptions were observed. For example, for protein
family 7.3.6.1, kernel p2 is the most discriminative kernel with
weight value of nearly 1, while the other two kernels only have
little contribution to the MKL (Supplementary Table S5 of
Supplementary Material S4). The top 10 most discriminative
Ngrams for each kernel were investigated, and the results are
shown in Supplementary Table S5 of Supplementary Material
S4, from which some interesting patterns can be observed. The
Ngrams containing amino acids “11’ and ‘f tended to show strong
discriminative power in both kernel P and kernel p1, whereas
amino acid ‘a’ was abundant in the top discriminative Ngrams
in kernel p2, indicating the Ngrams with amino acid ‘a’ could
better describe the prosperities of protein family 7.3.6.1 in the
evolutionary process.

3.5 Application of the proposed remote homology
detection methods for studying the 3D structure
of ch5a

In addition to provide useful insights for evolution study, pro-
tein remote homology detection is useful for drug develop-
ment as well. As is well known, many drug-targeted proteins
are still without X-ray or nuclear magnetic resonance structure.
Pharmaceutical scientists have to resort to the homology model-
ing technique or structural bioinformatics tools (Chou, 2004) to
timely develop their 3D structures, so as to be able to conduct

molecular docking study (Chou et al., 2003; Wang et al., 2009),
one of the key steps in structure-based drug design. However, a
reliable template, or a structure-known protein homologous to
the target protein, is the necessary prerequisite in this regard
(Chou, 2004). Unfortunately, many target proteins did not
have signiﬁcant sequence similarity with any structure-known
proteins, and hence it was hard to ﬁnd a proper template to
develop their 3D structures. Actually, many of them did have
structure-known homologous proteins, but the problem was how
to detect them. For example, the sequence similarity between
ch5a and CyclinA was <20% (Chou et al., 1999) and hence
their homologous relationship could not be detected by the
simple sequence alignment technique (Mohabatkar, 2010).
Now let us see what will happen if the current remote homology
detection technique is applied.

To realize this, a dataset was constructed based on SCOP,
from which 11 proteins were selected as the positive samples in
the cyclin family (SCOP ID: a.74.1.1), while 3605 negative sam-
ples were selected from the SCOP version 1.67 by excluding all
the proteins within the cyclin-like superfamily. None of these
proteins shares >95% sequence similarity. Trained with such
11 positive proteins and 3605 negative proteins, the proposed
best performing method SVM-LA (p1) was used to predict
ch5a. It was found that ch5a is homologous to CyclinA,
fully consistent with the experimental results obtained by the
site-directed mutagenesis studies (Tang et al., 1997). Actually,
Chou et al. (1999) did use CyclinA as a template to construct
the 3D structure of activation domain of ch5a, one of the im-
portant parts of tau protein kinase II, an important therapeutic
target against Alzheimer’s disease. Furthermore, based on the
computed structure thus obtained, the molecular truncation
experiments (Zhang et al., 2002) were conducted with an out-
come that conﬁrmed and validated the structure computed
by using such a remote homologous protein as a template.
Therefore, it is anticipated that the proposed method for
detecting remote homology proteins will certainly enhance the
power of homology modeling, and hence have impacts on drug
development as well.

4 CONCLUSION

Discriminative methods based on SVM are the most effective
and accurate methods for protein remote homology detection.
The performance of the SVM-based methods depends on
the kernel function, which measures the similarity between
the samples in any pair. Varieties of kernels based on sequence
composition have been proposed. However, these methods
often fail to accurately predict the proteins sharing low sequence
similarity. Recently, methods using the evolutionary information
extracted from proﬁles achieved great success, such as Proﬁle
(Kuang et al., 2005), SW—PSSM (Rangwala and Karypis,
2005), SVM-Top-Ngram (Liu et al., 2008) and SVM-ACC (Liu
et al., 2011). A key step to improve the performance of these
methods is in how to ﬁnd a suitable approach to incorporate the
evolutionary information extracted from the proﬁles for predic-
tion. In this article, we proposed a method that can convert
the frequency proﬁle into a series of proﬁle-based proteins.
Three state-of—the-art sequence-based kernels, i.e. SVM-Ngram
(Dong et al., 2006), SVM-pairwise (Liao and Noble, 2003) and

SVM-LA (Saigo et al., 2004), were selected for demonstration on
a well-known benchmark. It was shown that the methods based
on the proﬁle-based proteins p1 and p2 achieved the best per-
formance, outperforming the original three string kernels by
3.7 ~ 7.5% and 9.6 ~ 13.7%, respectively, according to the aver-
age ROC and ROC50 scores. These results are fully consistent
with our previous ﬁndings that the top two most frequent amino
acids show stronger discriminative power than the other low
frequent amino acids in the frequency proﬁles (Liu et al.,
2008), further conﬁrming that the proposed proﬁle-based protein
representation is a promising approach in extracting the evolu-
tionary information from frequency proﬁles for protein remote
homology detection.

It has not escaped our notice that the current approach can be
easily combined with sequence-based methods, and hence, with
the development of the sequence-based kernels, the currently
proposed method can be further improved accordingly. It is in-
structive to point out that since the concept of pseudo amino acid
composition, or Chou’s PseAAC (Lin and Lapointe, 2013), was
introduced in 2001 (Chou, 2001), it has been successfully used to
predict various attributes of proteins (e.g. Chen and Li, 2013;
Chou, 2005; Georgiou et al., 2009; Huang and Yuan, 2013;
Khosravian et al., 2013; Mohabatkar, 2010; Mohabatkar et al.,
2011, 2013; Mohammad Beigi et al., 2011; Nanni et al., 2012;
Sahu and Panda, 2010; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhou et al., 2007; Liu
et al., 2013). Accordingly, the potential would be high to develop
a powerful method for protein remote homology detection by
combing PseAAC with proﬁle-based protein representation. In
the original PseAAC, it only uses three indices, including the
hydrophobicity index, hydrophilicity index and side-chain mass
index. Because protein remote homology detection is a more
difﬁcult problem, proteins in the dataset only share low sequence
similarity. Only these three indices would not be enough to cap-
ture the different properties of various proteins. Therefore, our
further research will focus on incorporating new amino acid in-
dices into PseAAC and applying it to protein remote homology
detection.

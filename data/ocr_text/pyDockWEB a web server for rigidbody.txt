ABSTRACT

Summary: pyDockWEB is a web server for the rigid-body docking
prediction of protein—protein complex structures using a new version
of the pyDock scoring algorithm. We use here a new custom parallel
FTDock implementation, with adjusted grid size for optimal FFT cal-
culations, and a new version of pyDock, which dramatically speeds up
calculations while keeping the same predictive accuracy. Given the 3D
coordinates of two interacting proteins, pyDockWEB returns the best
docking orientations as scored mainly by electrostatics and desolva-
tion energy.

Availability and implementation: The server does not require regis-
tration by the user and is freely accessible for academics at http://life.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions mediate most cellular functions;
thus, a detailed description of the association process at molecu-
lar level is essential to comprehend the fundamental processes
that sustain life. In such line, protein—protein docking tools
aim to identify the native binding mode between two proteins
(Ritchie, 2008). Such predictions are required to complement
experimental techniques that cannot provide structural informa-
tion at a proteomics scale given their current technical limita-
tions. pyDock (Cheng et al., 2007) is a rigid-body docking
method in which sampling is performed by means of FTDock
(Gabb et al., 1997) and scoring implements an efficient empirical
potential, composed of electrostatics and desolvation terms, with
a limited contribution from van der Waals energy. The method
has been successfully tested in CAPRI (Grosdidier et al., 2007;
Mendez et al., 2003; Pons et al., 2010a). Here, we present
pyDockWEB server, a new fast implementation that allows
easy access to non-expert users to state-of-the-art docking
predictions.

2 PYDOCKWEB SERVER

pyDockWEB server is a web application for the use of the pro-
tein—protein docking and scoring program pyDock. Users can
easily send pyDock jobs to be executed in a five-step process Via
a user-friendly front-end (Fig. 1). In the first step, users have to
introduce a project name and a notiﬁcation email address. In the
second step, the scoring algorithm is selected. In the third step,
users can either upload their protein coordinate files or indicate
the PDB code, in which case, PDB files will be automatically
downloaded from RCSB Protein Data Bank. In both cases,
PDB files are automatically parsed to select available receptor
and ligand chains. An option to automatically set-up a docking
job with example PDB files is also available. In the fourth step,
users may specify optional distance restraints, which will be com-
puted using pyDockRST (Chelliah et al., 2006) module. Finally,
in the fifth step, users will double-check whether data provided
are correct and submit a docking job to the server queues. After
job submission, user is redirected to a web page where project
status is automatically updated and result files can be down-
loaded after computation is finished. In this web page, the top
10 models scored by pyDock are displayed using Jmol (http://
jmol.sourceforge.net/).

pyDockWEB is technically constituted by three different com-
ponents: a web front-end, pydockd, a daemon in charge of mana-
ging pyDock executions and a data storage system. The web
front-end has been implemented using I SF (Java Server Faces,
a Java-based web application framework), Ajax4sf (an open
source framework that adds Ajax capabilities to J SF framework)
and J SP (Java Server Pages) technologies. Data storage system
has been implemented Via one of the most popular choices in web
applications databases, MySQL (http://www.mysql.com). Data
tables have been designed to efﬁciently store the relevant job
information and to gather a few statistics about usage and com-
putation and queued times. The controller, pydockd, is an appli-
cation written in Python version 2.7, which periodically polls job
requests created from the web front-end and stored in the
MySQL database and submits them as pyDock job instances
to the Slurm batch queuing system (https://computing.llnl.gov/
linux/slurm/slurm.html).

pyDockWEB uses an optimized pyDock version 3, which also
includes a custom parallel version of FTDock, implemented
using the MPI (Message Passing Interface) library MPICH2
(Bouteiller et al., 2003) to generate docking poses, which is cap-
able to scale to multiple processors/cores. Another optimization

has been implemented, as follows. FTDock makes use of the
FFTW 2.1.5 (Frigo and Johnson, 1998) library to perform a
global scan of translational and rotational space having the
two molecules discretized onto orthogonal grids. The size of
the transform in the FFTW scope is proportional to the
FTDock grid size in number of cells, which was automatically
calculated from the single grid unit size and the size of the pro-
teins. However, according to FFTW’s documentation, FFTW
algorithms are optimal for sizes that follow Equation (1),

n=2a-3b-50-7d.116.13f (1)

where e + f is either 0 or 1, and the other exponents are arbitrary.
Other sizes are calculated by FFTW using slower algorithms.
Therefore, we have adjusted the FTDock grid size, n, to follow
Equation (1). This grid size optimization has been implemented
in the new custom parallel FTDock version. Supplementary
Figure S1 shows the difference of execution times between the
original and the grid optimized FTDock versions, as well as the
stability in terms of time of the parallel version using the grid size
optimization.

The server runs on a multi-user cluster with two nodes. Each
node has 16 cores (4 Intel Xeon E5620 Quad Core) at 2.4 GHz.
Two cores are reserved for MySQL, J Boss and interactive shells.
Physical memory is 65 GB, with 11 TB of total available disk
space.

3 BENCHMARKING AND DISCUSSION

The pyDockWEB server provides a user-friendly web front-end
to allow the academic community to use the pyDock rigid-body
docking and scoring method. The user is notiﬁed on completion
of the execution and is able to Visualize online the top 10 models
of the predicted complex using Jmol. We have evaluated the

performance of pyDockWEB server on the standard protein—
protein docking benchmark 4.0 (Hwang et al., 2010). The quality
of the results in terms of generated near-native solutions (ligand
RMSD within 10A from that in the X-ray complex structure)
has not been affected by the optimization and implementation
procedure, and the top 10 success rate (i.e. number of cases with
near-native solutions within top 10 scored poses) reached 17.0%
(Supplementary Table S1), in line with previous benchmarks
(Cheng et al., 2007; Pons et al., 2010b). This performance
is comparable with other reported servers, as shown on avail-
able protein—protein targets from current CAPRI edition
(Supplementary Table S2). Interestingly, sampling with
FTDock with the new custom parallel and variable grid size
implementation achieved speed-ups of up to 181 (50 as average)
with respect to the default FTDock distribution, whereas the
scoring process based on the new pyDock version 3 achieved
speed-ups of up to 40 (38 as average) with respect to the previ-
ously available version (Cheng et al., 2007).

Additional pyDock modules and new developments are
planned to be implemented in pyDockWEB in the future:
patch prediction (pyDockNIP), optimal docking area
(pyDockODA), domain—domain assembly (pyDockTET) and
SIPPER scoring energy (pyDockSIPPER).

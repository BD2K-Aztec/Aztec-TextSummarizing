Abstract

Motivation: Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization—Imaging Mass Spectrometry (MALDl—IMS)
in ‘omics’ data acquisition generates detailed information about the spatial distribution of mol—
ecules in a given biological sample. Various data processing methods have been developed for
exploring the resultant high volume data. However, most of these methods process data in the
spectral domain and do not make the most of the important spatial information available through
this technology. Therefore, we propose a novel streamlined data analysis pipeline specifically
developed for MALDl—IMS data utilizing significant spatial information for identifying hidden signifi—
cant molecular distribution patterns in these complex datasets.

Methods: The proposed unsupervised algorithm uses Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) and a
new spatial distribution based peak picking method developed based on Gray level Co—Occurrence
(GCO) matrices followed by clustering of biomolecules. We also use gist descriptors and an im—
proved version of GOD matrices to extract features from molecular images and minimum medoid
distance to automatically estimate the number of possible groups.

Results: We evaluated our algorithm using a new MALDl—IMS metabolomics dataset of a plant
(Eucalypt) leaf. The algorithm revealed hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in the
dataset, which the current Component Analysis and Segmentation Map based approaches failed to
extract. We further demonstrate the performance of our peak picking method over other traditional
approaches by using a publicly available MALDl—IMS proteomics dataset of a rat brain. Although
SWN did not show any significant improvement as compared with using no normalization, the vis—
ual assessment showed an improvement as compared to using the median normalization.

1 Introduction

Matrix Assisted Laser Desorption Ionization—Imaging Mass
Spectrometry (MALDI—IMS) (Caprioli et 61]., 1997) has gained popu—
larity in ‘omic’ sciences because of its ability to produce detailed spa—
tial information of molecules in a given biological sample. By using
a section of a tissue, IMS can visualize a wide variety of biomol—
ecules such as proteins, lipids and metabolites (Sugiura and Setou,
2010). Although this technique has been well established in prote—
omics (Groseclose et 61]., 2008; Jardin—Mathé et 61]., 2008;
Lagarrigue et 61]., 2012), the scope of the biological questions that
can be addressed through this technology is still limited mainly due
to the shortage of streamlined data analysis pipelines.

Figure 1 illustrates the typical MALDI—IMS data acquisition
workﬂow. In general, MALDI-IMS experiments are performed by
thaw mounting a frozen tissue section onto MALDI target, a matrix
is applied that promotes molecular desorption and ionization, and a
spectrum is acquired at each of the defined pixels. That is, for each
spatial coordinate of the optical image a mass spectrum is obtained
which represents the intensities of ionizable molecules with various
mass/charge (m/z) values. Therefore, a MALDI—IMS dataset can be
considered as a collection of spectra. Moreover, by plotting the in—
tensity values corresponding to one particular m/z value, the inten-
sity image represents the spatial distribution of the corresponding
molecule(s). Therefore, a MALDI—IMS dataset can also be con—
sidered as a collection of intensity images. Biologists are mainly
interested in identifying molecules that are differentially distributed
(show different abundances) in diverse anatomical regions thus pro—
viding valuable information about the living organism under study.

Usually the MALDI—IMS datasets are complex and extremely
large in size. For example, the Eucalypt leaf MALDI-Fourier
Transform Ion Cyclotron Resonance—Imaging Mass Spectrometer
(FTICR—IMS) data set, which is explained later in the sub section

Spatial distributions ofhinmolecules

discrete spatial coordinates of the tissue section. An intensity image is ob-
tained for each m/z value representing the spatial distribution of the corres-
ponding biomolecule

2.1.1, includes 6545 pixels (spectra) each of which has N720 peaks
resulting in a data set that is ~38 GB. Therefore, it is difficult and
time—consuming to manually extract meaningful information from
these datasets. Currently, some visualization software packages like
BioMap, FlexImaging, ImageQuest, Datacube Explorer, HDI (high-
definition MALDI MS imaging), Metabolite Imager, MSiReader,
SCiLS Lab and TissueView have been mainly used on continuous
type data sets, where the set of m/z values is the same for all spectra
(Gustafsson et 61]., 2011). However, some of them do not support
visualization of processed type datasets, where the set of m/z values
is different from one spectrum to another (Norris et 61]., 2007). Not
only these software packages, but also there are many other pub—
lished supervised and unsupervised methods which have not been
implemented as software tools.

Mainly two unsupervised learning approaches, namely
Component Analysis and Spatial Segmentation, have been utilized
for untargeted analysis of MALDI—IMS data (Alexandrov, 2012).
Several component analysis methods such as Principal Component
Analysis (PCA), non-negative matrix factorization, maximum auto—
correlation factorization and probabilistic latent semantic analysis
have been used to uncover the variation present in MALDI-IMS
data (Jones et 61]., 2011). Among these methods, PCA is the most
widely applied algorithm (Bonnel et 61]., 2011; Klerk et 61]., 2007)
which represents spatial patterns of molecules existing in the imag—
ing dataset in terms of a set of score images. Even though the mass
spectra do not contain negative intensity values, PCA score images
can contain negative values which make the interpretation a chal—
lenge (Alexandrov, 2012). A further difficulty is presented when
attempting to determine co—localized ion images for each identified
pattern.

The most commonly used unsupervised data mining approach in
MALDI-IMS is spatial segmentation (Alexandrov and Kobarg,
2011; Bruand et 61]., 2011; Trede et 61]., 2011). In this method, the
imaging dataset is represented as a segmentation map, created by
grouping spectra based on their similarity, highlighting chemically
equivalent regions of the tissue. Since the segmentation map is cre—
ated solely based on mass spectral intensities, without considering
their spatial relationships, it does not capture the underlying spatial
structure. Alexandrov et al. (2010) carried out de—noising of the in-
dividual intensity images before clustering spectra in order to im—
prove the segmentation map. However, not all of the spatial
relationships between spectra can be extracted through de—noising
alone. Hierarchical clustering algorithm has been extensively used
for clustering mass spectra (Bonnel et 61]., 2011; Deininger et 61].,
2008). However, it performs poorly when dealing with large and
noisy imaging datasets.

The main weakness of the above unsupervised learning
approaches is that they mainly process the dataset in the spectral do—
main and do not make the most of the important spatial information
available through this IMS technology. Recently, a spatial distribu—
tion based peak picking method and a clustering approach have
been introduced and they have shown promising results
(Alexandrov and Bartels, 2013; Alexandrov et 61]., 2013). Therefore
it is essential to develop a streamlined data analysis pipeline specific—
ally for IMS data utilizing the important spatial information avail-
able through this IMS technology.

In this paper, we propose a new data analysis pipeline for
revealing hidden significant molecular distribution patterns in
MALDI—IMS data (Fig. 2). The proposed algorithm consists of five
consecutive main steps: where the first step involves spectra prepro—
cessing. Then, Sliding Window Normalization (SWN) is used to nor—
malize the spectra and limit the inﬂuence of high intensity peaks.

Third, image de-noising and contrast enhancement are used to im—
prove the visualization of intensity images. Fourth, peak picking is
performed by processing the individual intensity images. We intro—
duce a new peak picking method based on an improved version of
Gray level Co—Occurrence (GCO) matrix. It should be noted that, in
this context, ‘peak picking’ denotes the process of identifying mol-
ecules with structured spatial distributions; which is different to the
standard process of finding peaks in a mass spectrum. Finally, inten-
sity images are clustered using the fuzzy c—means clustering algo—
rithm. Prior to clustering, gist descriptors and the improved version
of GCO matrices are used to extract features from individual inten-
sity images, and the number of clusters is automatically estimated
using minimum medoid distance.

The primary difference between the proposed workflow (Fig. 2)
and the existing spatial segmentation based methods is that after
spectra normalization the dataset is considered as a collection of in—
tensity images and the subsequent steps are applied on individual
images in order to incorporate the significant spatial information
such as pixel positions and the details of the neighbourhood pixels.
We used a MALDI—IMS metabolomics dataset of a Eucalypt leaf in
order to assess the complete pipeline and a publicly available prote—
omics dataset of a rat brain to assess our peak picking method.

2 Methods

2.1 Datasets
2.1.1 MALDI-IMS metabolomics data of eucalypt leaf
A leaf from a juvenile Eucalypt tree (Eucalyptus cladocalyx) was
ﬂash frozen in liquid nitrogen then sectioned on a cryostat at 35 um
thickness, thaw mounted on a glass slide then dried in a desiccator.
A thin layer of MALDI matrix was applied using a custom built
sublimation apparatus, 2,5—Dihydr0xy benzoic acid (DHB, Sigma-
Aldrich) was applied by sublimation to an average density of
0.25 i 0.05 mg/cmz.

MALDI-IMS experiments were performed in the positive ion
mode using a Bruker SolariX 7 Tesla Hybrid-ESUMALDI-FTICR-
IMS (Bremen, Germany) operated with Compass solarchontrol

CompassXport tool for the ease of manipulation. This is one of the
common file formats supported by most of the currently available
visualization tools.

The dataset contains mass spectra for pixels within the high-
lighted window in Figure 3. The clearly visible anatomical structure
of the Eucalypt leaf makes this an appropriate dataset to benchmark
different methods. Figure 3 illustrates the basic parts of this leaf
namely midrib, veins, oil glands and blade. These different regions
have different molecular compositions.

2.1.2 MALDI-IMS proteomics data of a rat brain

Alexandrov and Bartels (2013) used 250 intensity images taken
from a MALDI imaging proteomics dataset of a rat brain
(Alexandrov et al., 2010) to evaluate their peak picking algorithm.
It consists of 50 unstructured and 200 structured images which can
be further divided into four groups based on their spatial patterns
namely ‘Regions’ (contain large separated regions of high intensity
pixels), ‘Curves’ (contain curve like regions with high intensity pix-
els), ‘Gradients’ (contain large regions of high intensity pixels with
outwardly decreasing intensity gradients around them) and ‘Islets’
(contain small regions of high intensity pixels). We used these test
sets to compare our peak picking method with existing methods
(Fig. 4).

2.2 Pipeline for discovering hidden profiles

in MALDI-IMS data

The algorithm outlined in Figure 2 consists of five main steps
namely data preprocessing, spectra normalization, improving visual-
ization of intensity images, peak picking and clustering of biomol—
ecules based on their spatial structure. These steps are explained in
detail below:

2.2.1 Data preprocessing

Binning is used to reduce the dimensionality of the szML dataset.
This is a frequently used method in mass spectral data analysis
(Clerens et al., 2006; Norris et al., 2007). Although, the MALDI-
FTICR—IMS data was collected at high mass resolution (>100 000 at
400 m/z), within this study we chose bin widths of 0.1 m/z units to
reduce computational overhead. Then, all m/z values and the

2.2.2 Spectra normalization

Spectra Normalization is used to facilitate direct comparison of
peak intensities between different spectra. In order to overcome the
limitations of the existing MALDI—IMS spectra normalization tech—
niques, we propose Sliding Window Normalization (SWN). In
SWN, the normalization factor of each peak is determined only by a
set of peaks within a certain range of the spectrum, i.e. the peaks
within the window defined on the m/z axis (Fig. 5). Each peak inten-
sity is divided by the median intensity value of the peaks within the
window. Then, the window can be slid along the spectrum to nor—
malize all the peaks. The width of the window is set to 50 m/z
empirically.

2.2.3 Improving visualization of intensity images

We used median filtering with a 3 X 3 neighbourhood in order to
‘clean’ the spectra from technology driven artefacts leaving only the
relevant information. Also, histogram equalization was used to elim—
inate hotspots and to improve visualization of intensity images (Van
de Plas et al., 2007). It adjusts the contrast level by spreading out
most frequent intensity values.

2.2.4 Peak picking

Peak picking is used to reduce the large amount of data contained in
the MALDI—IMS datasets by selecting m/z values only for specific
peaks. Biologists are interested in selecting molecules that are differ—
entially distributed (show different abundances) in diverse regions
thus creating structured molecular images. Therefore, we propose a
new peak picking method based on spatial structure captured by
Gray level Co—Occurrence (GCO) matrix (Gadelmawla et al., 2004)
to extract those structured molecular images.

GCO matrix is a second order histogram that is computed from
the intensities of consecutive pairs of pixels in the image. First, the
intensity values in the image should be quantized, reducing the num—
ber of intensity levels to 8. Here, we suggest quantising the intensity

The corresponding horizontal GCO matrix. In the GOD matrix, the entry at the
coordinate (i,j) is the number of pixel pairs having gray levels i and j consecu-
tively in the horizontal direction of the quantized square image

values of the image based on its intensity histogram. We split the in-
tensity range into 8 intervals in such a way that the area under the
image histogram is same for all the intervals. An example of a quan—
tized square image with intensity values {1, 2 . . . 8} is shown in
Figure 6a. In the GCO matrix shown in Figure 6b, the entry at each
coordinate (i,j) is defined as the number of pixel pairs having gray
levels i and j consecutively in the horizontal direction of the quan-
tized square image. For example, the existence of two pairs of
consecutive pixels with intensity values {1,1} (meaning two c0—
occurrences of {1,1}) in the quantized image would mean that, the
GCO matrix has the entry ‘2’ at the coordinate (1,1). In this work,
for each image, gray level co—occurrences in four directions, 0", 45 0,
900 and 135 O are calculated.

However, not all the values in the GCO matrix are important for
measuring the level of structure. The main idea is that, the structured
images should have a pattern containing a large number of pairs of
pixels with co—occurring low intensity values and co-occurring high in-
tensity values, because the contrast between those two sets of intensity
values exhibits a clear structure. Therefore, only the numbers of those
pairs of pixels are of interest. We propose to use two weight vectors
created logically based on the above idea, along with the GCO matri—
ces for identifying intensity images exhibiting structured distributions.
The proposed weight vectors assign higher weights to the aforemen—
tioned important values in the GCO matrices (see highlighted values
in Fig. 7b) and disregard the other values.

These weights are assigned accordingly to capture two measures
M1 and M2 representing regions with low intensities and high inten-
sities respectively.

(2)

where, gc0(i,j) is the entry at the coordinate (i,j) in the GCO matrix.

These two measures should be high for structured images and
low for unstructured images. Therefore, all the intensity images are
ranked based on these values and structured images are selected.
Unlike the other methods, this technique does not completely rely
on intensity values and selects molecules based on their spatial
distribution.

2.2.5 Clustering

Two different methods based on gist descriptors and GCO matrices
are used to extract features from intensity images prior to clustering.
Human capability to recognize a scene or gather the necessary de—
tails to distinguish it from another scene is known as the gist of a
scene. In our first method, the following steps are used to extract
gist features related to orientation from intensity images
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

First, each image is split into nine regions and then each region is
filtered with four Gabor filters representing four angles (see
Supplementary Fig. S1). Gabor filtering emphasizes the visual details
in the considered direction and it is believed that the orientation rep—
resentations of Gabor filters are equivalent to human vision (Siagian
and Itti, 2007). After applying Gabor filters, averaging operation is
used to find a representative value for each region.

After extracting features through gist descriptors, the improved
version of the GCO matrix based method is used to further extract
textural features from the intensity images. In this work, for each
image, gray level co—occurrences in four directions, 0", 45 0, 900 and
1350 are calculated. Moreover, in order to further improve the ac—
curacy of the results, at the beginning, each image is divided in to 9
regions in such a way that there are overlaps between the regions
and GCO matrices are calculated for each region separately.

All the features extracted through these two methods (outcomes
of Gabor filtering and values in each GCO matrix) are scaled to be
in the range 0 t0 1 and then, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is
used to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. In this study,
fuzzy c-means algorithm is used for clustering biomolecules instead

of a hard clustering method. Only the data objects with membership
values over 0.5 are selected for each cluster. However, when using
the fuzzy c—means clustering algorithm, we need to specify the num—
ber of clusters a priori. We propose a measure calculated using
medoid distances to estimate the number of clusters. Medoid is an
element of a cluster whose average difference to all the other mem—
bers of the same cluster is minimal. We expect clustering algorithms
to maximize the distance between clusters. Since medoids are repre—
sentative objects of clusters, a better clustering result can be ob—
tained by minimizing the distances between cluster medoids. If the
distance between the medoids of the two nearest clusters is high,
then it denotes a good clustering result. Therefore, we suggest using
the number of clusters which maximize the minimum medoid dis-
tance as the optimal number of clusters.

The following equation is used to estimate the number of clusters
where m,-, m,- are cluster medoids.

3 Results

The important steps in the proposed data analysis pipeline are dis—
cussed in detail along with the results under Sections 3.1—3.4. We
use the data sets described in Section 2.1 to further describe the pipe—
line and to evaluate the performance.

3.1 Spectra normalization

The most commonly used normalization method in MALDI-IMS is
the Total Ion Count (TIC) normalization, where all peak intensities
in the spectrum are divided by its TIC value (sum of all peak inten—
sities in the spectrum). However, in TIC normalization, the area
under a spectrum is assumed to be similar for all spectra, which is
not a reasonable assumption for processed type datasets. Hence, it
cannot be used to normalize the Eucalypt leaf dataset. Deininger
et al. (2011) has proposed to use median normalization in order to
overcome this limitation. Therefore, we compare the performance of
our SWN method with median normalization. Figure 8 shows an in-
tensity image (i) before normalization, (ii) after median normaliza-
tion and (iii) after sliding window normalization. The distribution
of the metabolites within the considered mass bin (especially in the
upper section of the leaf) is clearly more visible in the third image
than the first two images, which encourages the consideration of
SWN for normalizing MALDI-IMS data.

3.2 Improve visualization

Figure 9 shows an intensity image (i) before histogram equalization,
(ii) after histogram equalization and the corresponding image histo—
grams (a), (b). It can be clearly seen that the hot spot in the original
image has lessen the appearance of the distribution of the molecule
in other regions. Since, histogram equalization adjusts the contrast
level by spreading out most frequent intensity values, it can be used
to eliminate hotspots and improve visualization of intensity images.

3.3 Peak picking

The new peak picking method selects molecular images completely
based on their level of spatial structure. We use the dataset described
in Section 2.1.2 to compare the performance of the new peak pick—
ing method with the widely used mean spectrum based approach
and the spatial distribution based approach recently introduced in
Alexandrov and Bartels (2013). Each structured test set (‘Regions’,

‘Curves’, ‘Gradients’ and ‘Islets’) is mixed with the unstructured test
set and the accuracy of extracting the structured images is calculated
for each case. Figure 10 illustrates the accuracies of the three meth—
ods when selecting ‘k’ number of images from the mixed groups,
where k varies from 1 to 50. Here, the accuracy is defined as the per—
centage of structured images out of the selected images. According
to these figures, the new peak picking method performs significantly
better than the widely used spectrum based approach in all four
cases. Also, it outperforms the method introduced in Alexandrov
and Bartels (2013) in all the instances except when selecting struc—
tured images with small regions of high intensity pixels (‘Islets’).
Our method extracts structured images with Regions, Curves and
Gradients with 100% accuracy when k349, k327 and kg 13,
respectively.

Moreover, the most structured 250 intensity images out of the
3150 images were extracted by applying this new spatial peak pick—
ing method to the Eucalypt leaf dataset.

3.4 Clustering

Both gist descriptors and GCO matrices together extracted 2340
features. Therefore, Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used
to reduce the dimensionality of the feature space. PCA reduced the
number of features to 13 by preserving up to 98% of the variance.
The number of clusters estimated by the proposed minimum medoid
distance method is 4.

Figure 1 1A shows the significant metabolite distribution patterns
discovered after using fuzzy c—means clustering algorithm along with
SWN. Note that these are cluster average patterns. In Figure 11A,
Pattern (A1) represents metabolites that are distributed in the

midrib, veins and oil glands, but not in the blade. Similarly, Pattern
(A2) represents metabolites distributed mainly in the midrib and
veins. Both Pattern (A3) and Pattern (A4) represent metabolites dis—
tributed only in the blade, however metabolites in Pattern (A4) are
only concentrated in the lower section of the image. The proposed
MALDI—IMS data analysis pipeline discovered these hidden signifi—
cant molecular distribution patterns which the existing methods
failed to extract. These patterns are followed by 52, 50, 66 and 15
mass bins respectively. Supplementary Figure S2 shows a set of mass
bins that follow Pattern (A1). Interestingly, we can see potential iso—
topes in this figure such as (610.3 86 611.3) which further validates
the applicability of the proposed pipeline because in general, ions
related to the same metabolite such as isotopes are expected to fol—
low the same spatial pattern.

Moreover, in order to assess the effect of spectra normalization -
in particular the proposed SWN method — on the final result, we
compared the cluster average patterns generated by the data analysis
pipeline utilizing SWN (Fig. 11A), median normalization (Fig. 11B)
and no normalization (Fig. 11C). It can be clearly seen that the pipe—
line which used median normalization has failed to extract some
hidden unique molecular distribution patterns (eg. Pattern A2).
Further, the obtained patterns are not as distinctive as those ob—
tained from the pipeline with SWN. This is due to the fact that, the
standard normalization techniques, which use a single normalization
factor calculated considering the entire spectrum, tend to suppress
some low abundant molecules (Deininger et al., 2011). Interestingly,
the molecular distribution patterns extracted by the pipeline with no
normalization are similar to those patterns extracted by the pipeline
with SWN. However, in terms of visualization, a slight improve-
ment can be seen in the patterns extracted by the latter.

Supplementary Figure S3 shows the patterns extracted from the
rat brain proteomics dataset.

4 Discussion

4.1 Importance of the new algorithm

Mainly two unsupervised learning approaches namely component
analysis and spatial segmentation have been used for untargeted
analysis of MALDI—IMS data (Alexandrov, 2012). However, some—
times these techniques fail to uncover the general data structure of
complex and high volume MALDI—IMS datasets as they do not
make the most of available spatial information. We demonstrate the
limitations by applying them to the MALDI—IMS Eucalypt leaf data—
set described in Section 2.1.1 (see Supplementary Fig. S4, SS).

The PCA score images in Supplementary Figure S4 do not reveal
the hidden differential molecular distribution patterns, which define
the important anatomical regions of the biological tissue under
study. Also, we cannot see a strong visual correlation between the
score images and their corresponding highest loading intensity
images, which makes the use of loadings for selecting intensity
images co—localized with each pattern, as the case for the component
analysis method questionable. Moreover, the segmentation maps of
the MALDI—IMS Eucalypt leaf dataset, obtained by clustering the
spectra using the widely used hierarchical clustering method, poorly
capture the underlying spatial structure (see Supplementary Fig. SS ).

The algorithm proposed in this paper, successfully extracts the
hidden significant molecular distribution patterns existing in the
dataset. The primary difference between the new workflow and
the existing spatial segmentation method is that, in this new
MALDI—IMS data analysis pipeline, after spectra normalization the
dataset is considered as a collection of intensity images rather than a
collection of spectra and the subsequent steps are applied on

Fig. 10. Comparison of different peak picking methods. Each structured test set (‘Regions', ‘Curves’, ‘Gradients' and ‘lslets’) is mixed with the unstructured test

set and the accuracy of extracting the structured images is calculated for each case (A-D). The accuracies of the three peak picking methods are plotted against k,
which is the number of images to be selected. At k: 50, our method extracted structured images with Regions, Curves, Gradients and Islets with an accuracy of

98%, 84%, 72% and 62% respectively

individual images. Therefore, the new algorithm incorporates not
only the peak intensities but also the spatial relationships of spectra
when clustering the molecular images, which leads to the identifica—
tion of hidden patterns.

The proposed algorithm would work well for data generated
from low mass resolution imaging mass spectrometers, such as
MALDI Time of Flight (TOF). In this study, data was generated
from MALDI-FTICR—IMS across 200 and 1500 m/z with a very high
mass resolution. Processing of these data requires substantial com—
puter power. Therefore, a binning technique was used to reduce the
computational overhead. As a result, the algorithm extracted mass
bins showing significant spatial distributions, not individual m/z
values. Several m/z values can be contributing to each mass bin
(see Supplementary Fig. S6). We demonstrate that our algorithm
also works on real m/z values by using small mass ranges
(see Supplementary Fig. S7).

The required computational time depends on the image size, the
number of peaks within the considered mass range as well as the
selected bin width. When the bin width was set to 0.1 m/z, our algo—
rithm took N6 min to produce the output considering the entire

mass range (200—1500 m/z), on a Windows 7 (64—bit) operating sys—
tem running on a Core i7—2600 CPU at 3.40GHz with 8.0 GB
Random Access Memory. When 0.0001 m/z bins were considered,
the run time of the proposed algorithm was N7 min for the mass
range 45 0—460 m/z.

4.2 Spectra normalization

The existing spectra normalization methods may produce mislead—
ing results due to the influence of high intensity peaks. The principal
difference of our SWN method from the existing methods is that, it
uses the local distribution when normalizing peaks rather than using
the entire spectrum, thus reducing the inﬂuence of high intense
peaks. Also, it can be used for normalizing both continuous type
datasets (where the set of m/z values is the same for all spectra) as
well as processed type datasets (where the set of m/z values is differ-
ent from one spectrum to another).

However, when using the SWN method, it is required to set the
width of the window, which should be less than the length of the
spectrum. In this study, it was set to 50 m/z by attempting several
values and visually inspecting the resultant ion images to assess the

Fig. 11. Cluster average patterns of the Eucalypt leaf dataset (A) with sliding
window normalization, (B) with median normalization and (C) without nor-
malization. Pattern (A1) represents metabolites that are distributed in the mid-
rib, veins and oil glands, but not in the blade. Pattern (A2) represents
metabolites distributed mainly in the midrib and veins. Both Pattern (A3) and
Pattern (A4) represent metabolites distributed only in the blade, however me-
tabolites in Pattern (A4) are only concentrated in the lower section of the leaf

suitability of the width. Even though we believe that this value is
suitable for most of the spectral datasets as generally the length of a
spectrum is higher than 50 m/z, the normalization results can be fur—
ther improved by optimizing this value. More work needs to be
done using simulated or real datasets with some prior knowledge in
this regard.

Although the importance of normalizing the low resolution IMS
data like MALDI—TOF—IMS data has been validated (Deininger
et al., 2011), the fact that there is no significant difference among
the patterns extracted from the proposed pipeline with SWN and
without normalization, suggest to further assess the need of normal—
ization for MALDI-FTICR—IMS data. We suggest that a more sig—
nificant improvement in results can be obtained with SWN
normalization when the anatomical structure of the biological sam—
ple under study and the corresponding molecular distributions are
more complex as the SWN method tend to make the images clearer.
However, more work needs to be done using multiple datasets to
support this suggestion.

Also, it should be noted that even though this method shows ad—
vantages over the other normalization techniques in the context of
IMS data processing, it is not suitable to be used for normalizing
mass spectrometry data where the relative abundances of ions need
to be preserved.

4.3 Improve visualization

Visualization of molecular distributions can be significantly
improved through de—noising. However, it is important to select a
de—noising method that does not eradicate edges and small import—
ant details. We use median filtering as the de—noising method as it is
capable of removing noise while preserving boundaries and small
details, which is more important for this application. Moreover, in
MALDI—IMS datasets, some spectra may show artificial patterns

that lead to hotspots in intensity images. These hotspots lessen the
appearance of the distribution of the molecule in other regions and
affect the subsequent steps (Watrous et al., 2011). Histogram equal—
ization eliminates these hotspots thereby improving visualization of
intensity images.

4.4 Peak picking

The proposed new spatial distribution based peak picking method is
the most significant contribution of this paper. Peak picking has al-
ways been a challenge when processing high volume imaging data-
sets as the existing spectra—based methods suffer from low sensitivity
(Alexandrov and Bartels, 2013). Mostly peak picking is applied to
the dataset mean spectrum, and m/z bin values corresponding to
high intense peaks are selected (Deininger et al., 2008). However,
we cannot always guarantee that high intense peaks correspond to
metabolites with significant molecular distributions. Also, this
method may not be able to select high intense peaks that appear in a
small region of the tissue (Watrous et al., 2011). These spectra based
approaches have significant limitations as they only consider peak
intensities and do not pay attention to the important spatial relation—
ships of spectra. To the best of our knowledge, only one paper has
proposed a peak picking method by incorporating spatial relation-
ships of spectra (Alexandrov and Bartels, 2013).

In this study, we use GCO matrices to extract structured inten—
sity images. In all existing studies on GCO matrix method, intensity
range of the image is divided into 8 equal intervals (Gadelmawla
et al., 2004). However, the intensity distributions of molecular
images are not always uniform. For this reason, sometimes GCO
matrices fail to represent the significant changes in pixel intensities
accurately. Therefore, we quantized the intensity values of the image
based on its intensity histogram. Moreover, the GCO matrices along
with the weight vectors proposed in this paper can be used to iden—
tify any type of image which shows a structured distribution.

By using the MALDI—IMS dataset of a rat brain, we show that
our new unsupervised peak picking method outperforms both the
spectra based method and the method introduced by Alexandrov
and Bartels (2013). The new method achieved an accuracy of 98%
when selecting intensity images with large separated regions of high
intensity pixels. For the ‘gradients’ also our method achieved a sig—
nificant accuracy, unlike the method in Alexandrov and Bartels
(2013), which performed weakly as edge detection cannot detect
clear edges when the separation between the regions is not clear.
Although, the method in Alexandrov and Bartels (2013) outper—
forms our method when selecting intensity images with small re-
gions of high intensity pixels (‘islets’), usually the occurrence of
structured images with ‘islets’ is less when compared to that of ‘re—
gions’, ‘gradients’ and ‘curves’. It should also be noted that the
method in Alexandrov and Bartels (2013) requires a parameter to be
set and they have shown an improvement in the results of their
method when the best possible parameter value is used. However, as
they have mentioned, selecting the best possible parameter value is
not feasible in practice. Therefore, those results were not used in our
comparison study. In addition, the proposed new peak picking algo—
rithm also complements the detection of important molecules in
other imaging datasets.

4.5 Clustering

Prior to clustering, each intensity image was divided into nine re—
gions and features were extracted from each region separately. This
step was utilized in order to capture the dissimilarity of images
showing the same distribution in different regions thus avoiding
them being clustered into the same group.

Real datasets usually contain significant amounts of background
noise and the clusters might have different sizes. As a result, hard
clustering methods like kmeans and hierarchical clustering mostly
fail to extract all hidden significant patterns that exist in the dataset
and generate false clustering results. In fuzzy clustering, data objects
are not directly assigned to clusters; instead each object is assigned a
membership value for each cluster. This method has proven to be
more efficient when dealing with noisy data (Schwammle and
Jensen, 2010) because usually data objects related to background
noise have distributed membership values. With this method, the in—
ﬂuence of such data objects to the final result can be reduced as they
have low inﬂuence in estimating cluster centroids.

Moreover, minimum medoid distance is a simple and efficient
method that can be used for automatically estimating the number of
clusters, and to the best of our knowledge it has not been used
before.

Abstract

Motivation: We present a novel method and corresponding application, MetAmp, to combine
amplicon data from multiple genomic markers into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) for
microbial community analysis, calibrating the markers using data from known microbial genomes.
When amplicons for multiple markers such as the 168 rRNA gene hypervariable regions are
available, MetAmp improves the accuracy of OTU—based methods for characterizing bacterial
composition and community structure. MetAmp works best with at least three markers, and is ap—
plicable to non—bacterial analyses and to non 16S markers. Our application and testing have been

limited to 16$ analysis of microbial communities.

Results: We clustered standard test sequences derived from the Human Microbiome Mock
Community test sets and compared MetAmp and other tools with respect to their ability to recover
OTUs for these benchmark bacterial communities. MetAmp compared favorably to QIIME,
UPARSE and Mothur using amplicons from one, two, and three markers.

Availability and implementation: MetAmp is available at http://izhbannikov.github.io/MetAmp/

1 Introduction

High-throughput sequencing technologies allow researchers to char—
acterize microbial community composition and structure without
first cultivating the microbes. There are two current techniques for
analyzing microbial communities: metagenomic and genomic
marker sequencing. Metagenomic analysis fragments and sequences
all DNA in a sample, and then optionally assembles and maps genes
into annotated genomes. One often uses metagenomic analysis to
characterize metabolic potential.

Marker sequencing amplifies and sequences conserved but vari—
able genomic regions, usually hypervariable regions of the essential
16S rRNA gene. One then clusters these sequences, known as
amplicons, into Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs). This ap—
proach can handle unknown and highly diverged populations,
provided that the OTUs correspond with sufficient accuracy to rele—
vant ecological units. Metagenomic and amplicon analysis therefore

answer different research questions. MetAmp targets only amplicon
analysis.

Most marker based studies use amplicons of just one marker,
and it is difficult to know which marker to select a priori.
Amplicons from different markers in a given sample, or even from a
single species, can cluster differently, giving very different pictures
of the underlying microbial community. Different markers may also
lead to very different phylogenies and taxonomies, which can differ
substantially from those deduced from known genomes.
Unfortunately, current bioinformatics techniques assume a single
marker. This is true of the best currently available software for
amplicon OTU analysis, such as UPARSE (Edgar, 2013), QIIME
(Kuczynski et 61]., 2011) and Mothur (Schloss et 61]., 2011). We intro—
duce the ‘Meta—amplicon analysis’ technique, MetAmp, which
makes it possible to clusters and analyze amplicons from multiple

markers.

Combining amplicon data from multiple markers

1831

 

2 Methods and algorithms

MetAmp borrows from image registration algorithms in image pro-
cessing. These identify known reference points, called ‘registration
marks’, in several images and map them onto known features in a
reference image, transforming other pixels accordingly (Zitov and
Flusser, 2003). In MetAmp, marker sequences play the role of regis—
tration marks, and amplicon sequences that of pixels. MetAmp
works as follows:

1. MetAmp builds a 2D reference topology of microbial popula—
tions (Fig. 1a, top plane) in which points correspond to known,
full 165 gene sequences and the distances between the points
approximates the distances between the corresponding full 165
sequences region (reference points: green on top plane). Later
steps will use this topology as a ‘gold standard’ onto which
MetAmp will map similar amplicon—induced topologies for each
marker. To do this, MetAmp:

a. Computes the pairwise distances of a set of known, full-
length 165 gene sequences in a global alignment; and

b. Maps the sequences onto a 2D plane (reference points, green
on top plane) using Sammon Non—linear Multi-Dimensional
Scaling (SNMDS) (Sammon, 1969).

ials for more on the analysis workflow, algorithmic complexity, parameters
and examples

2. MetAmp then builds a separate guided empirical topology for
each marker sequence. These 2D topologies contain both anchor
points (‘registration marks’ in the image processing literature)
and the user’s empirical amplicon sequences, with distances in
the plane approximating distances between the underlying se—
quences. To do this, for each marker, MetAmp:

a. Extracts the marker sequences from the full 165 sequences
used in the reference topology, to use as anchor points (Fig.
1a—c, hollow green circles). MetAmp extracts the marker se—
quences bioinformatically using same forward and reverse
primers that deﬁne the marker regions. In essence, this is a
digital PCR of marker regions from known full length 165
genes, with perfect primer matching.

b. Adds the empirical amplicon sequences (Fig. 1b and c, ﬁlled
blue circles) which the user acquired by from high through-
put sequencing.

c. Builds a distance matrix from global pairwise alignment of
both anchor and empirical sequences combined, using the
same methodology as in building the reference topology
earlier.

d. Maps both anchor and empirical amplicon sequences onto a
2D plane in a distance—approximating way using SNMDS.
This guided empirical topology now contains user sequence
data embedded into a topology with anchor points, which
will guide the next step (Fig. 1c, smaller planes).

3. MetAmp then maps each guided empirical plane, one for each
marker, onto the reference plane. In this mapping, the anchor
points map onto their corresponding reference points, and the
empirical points map into the reference plane with the same con—
volution as in the anchor—to—reference mapping (Fig. 1b and c,
arrows). Currently, the mapping is an afﬁne transformation,
similar to that used to map pixels in images with registration
marks onto a reference image.

4. The resulting plane contains reference sequences correspond—
ing to known 165 genes and empirical points corresponding
to user amplicon sequences (Fig. 1c). The distances between
the empirical points correspond to distances between the
user amplicon sequences, using the best available (full length
165) sequence data to correct for distortions caused by the
choice of individual markers. The points in the resulting plane
are therefore ready for clustering and downstream OTU
analysis.

3 Validation

We validated MetAmp by performing OTU analysis on two
amplicon datasets from the Human Microbiome Mock Community
www.hmpdacc.0rg/HMMC, namely the ‘Even’ (SRR072220,
SRR072239), and the ‘Staggered’ communities (SRR072221,
SRR072223, SRR072237). These two datasets include amplicons
from three marker regions (V13, V35 and V69) from Roche 454 GS
FLX Titanium sequencing of two communities with 22 known spe—
cies. Illumina paired end sequences were not available for the
HMMC at the time of this writing.

These experiments test the ability of standard OTU analysis
pipeline to recover known OTUs, both with and without multiple
marker data that has been pre—processed with MetAmp. We
computed the average number of OTUs formed by clustering these
data using MetAmp, UPARSE, Mothur, and QIIME and report the
ratio of this average to the known number of populations (22).

populations that aren’t there, and smaller values failing to recognize
some that are. We tested each tool on V13, V35, V69 individually,
and additionally tested MetAmp on pairs and triplets of these
markers. MetAmp ran for about 8 h using the whole reference data
set (about 5 .1k genes) on Intel Core i5 Macbook Pro laptop.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: The ability to accurately measure structural similarities
among small molecules is important for many analysis routines in
drug discovery and chemical genomics. Algorithms used for this pur-
pose include fragment-based fingerprint and graph-based maximum
common substructure (MCS) methods. MCS approaches provide
one of the most accurate similarity measures. However, their rigid
matching policies limit them to the identification of perfect MCSs. To
eliminate this restriction, we introduce a new mismatch tolerant search
method for identifying flexible MCSs (FMCSs) containing a user-defin-
able number of atom and/or bond mismatches.

Results: The fmcsR package provides an R interface, with the time-
consuming steps of the FMCS algorithm implemented in C++. It
includes utilities for painNise compound comparisons, structure simi-
larity searching, clustering and visualization of MCSs. In comparison
with an existing MCS tool, fmcsR shows better time performance over
a wide range of compound sizes. When mismatching of atoms or
bonds is turned on, the compute times increase as expected, and
the resulting FMCSs are often substantially larger than their strict
MCS counterparts. Based on extensive virtual screening (VS) tests,
the flexible matching feature enhances the enrichment of active struc-
tures at the top of MCS-based similarity search results. With respect
to overall and early enrichment performance, FMCS outperforms most
of the seven other VS methods considered in these tests.

1 INTRODUCTION

The development of computational methods for detecting and
quantifying structural similarities among small molecules is an
area of intensive research in drug discovery and chemical gen-
omics. The effort is largely driven by the observation that many
structurally related compounds share similar bioactivity and phy-
sicochemical properties ON ale et al., 2010). Maximum common
substructure (MCS) approaches are commonly used to identify
the largest substructure (subgraph) shared among two com-
pounds (Cao et al., 2008a; Conte et al., 2004; Hariharan et al.,

2011; Hattori et al., 2003; Rahman et al., 2009; Raymond and
Willett, 2002; Wang et al., 2009). MCS is a pairwise graph
matching concept that differs fundamentally from the structural
descriptor-based methods, but its results (e.g. size of MCS rela-
tive to source structures) can be used for the computation of
related similarity coefﬁcients. Compared with descriptor-based
similarity methods, MCS approaches generate chemically more
meaningful search results by pinpointing the common features
within the structure of two compounds. They also provide the
most efﬁcient method for identifying local structural similarities
and similarities among compounds with large size differences
(Rahman et al., 2009). With the exception of bond mismatches,
existing MCS search algorithms can only identify MCSs that are
perfect substructure matches in two compounds of interest.
Extending this strict matching scheme to one that tolerates mis-
matches among atoms and/or bonds facilitates the identification
of larger flexible MCSs (FMCSs) than their strict MCS counter-
parts, resulting in a more complete description of the similarities
among two compounds. Here we introduce such a FMCS algo-
rithm that allows both mismatches of atoms and/ or bonds in the
identified MCSs. When the flexible matching feature is enabled,
the user can identify more complex and subtle similarity patterns
among two structures than is possible with strict MCS algo-
rithms (Fig. 1A). For instance, two molecules may share a
larger imperfect MCS that is disrupted by a substitution of a
small number of atoms. Strict MCS algorithms will identify in
these cases only the largest invariant subcomponent(s), while the
FMCS algorithm will often find a much larger, but partially
imperfect MCS (Fig. 1A). This has various advantages for prac-
tical applications in small molecule discovery, such as the predic-
tion of bioactive compounds, scaffold identification in screening
libraries or assignment of metabolic compounds to enzymatic
steps in pathways.

2 METHODS
2.1 Background

To meet the above requirements, we designed the FMCS algorithm as
an extension of our previously published backtracking VF algorithm
for MCS detection (Cao et al., 2008a) where we enabled ﬂexible matching
by introducing counters for bond and atom mismatch tracking, and fur-
ther optimized its time performance. A detailed outline of the algorithm
is provided in the Supplementary Materials Section S1. To achieve both
optimal performance and usability of the method for data mining appli-
cations, the time-consuming computational steps of fmcsR are imple-
mented in C++, and its R interface integrates the small molecule
analysis utilities and S4 object classes provided by the ChemmineR library
(Backman et al., 2011; Cao et al., 2008b; O’Boyle et al., 2008).

Fig. 1. Performance comparisons of FMCS with other methods. (A) The
MCS and FMCS shared among two small molecules are highlighted. The
gray fragment is the MCS result, and the gray and black fragments
combined are the FMCS result obtained with one atom mismatch. (B)
The plot compares the size distributions of MCS/FMCS results. Test
compound pairs were randomly selected from DrugBank considering
1000 pairs within each of six size categories (x-axis) ranging from 5 to
60 non-hydrogen atoms. Each member of a compound pair had to fall
into the same size category. The size distributions of the MCS/FMCS
matches (y-axis) computed for these pairs are represented as box plots.
The SMSD results are given in white and the FMCS results with three
different mismatch settings are given in gray allowing zero (FMCSOO),
one (FMCS11), two (FMCS22) or three (FMCS33) bond and atom mis-
matches. (C) The corresponding compute time distributions of the four
methods are plotted for the same dataset used in the previous plot. (D)
The VS performance of FMCS with three different mismatch settings is
compared with seven other methods (atom pairs, AP; atom pair ﬁnger-
prints, APFP; PubChem ﬁngerprints, PCFP; MACCS keys; the graph
fragment-based method AFGen, the 3D methods SHAFTS and OAK).
Averaged awAUC (arithmetically weighted area under the receiver-oper-
ating characteristic curve) values are plotted and the methods have been
sorted along the x-axis by their performance. As test dataset, a subset of
13 compound sets from the Directory of Useful Decoys was used that is
optimized for benchmarking VS experiments. More details and source
data are provided in the Supplementary Materials S2 and Supplementary
Table S1. (E) The plot compares the early enrichment performance of the
same methods and test datasets used in the previous plot. The results are
plotted as awROCE (arithmetically weighted receiver-operating charac-
teristic enrichment) values obtained at false-positive rates of 0.5, 1.0, 2
and 5% (for details see Supplementary Materials S2 and Supplementary
Table S6)

2.2 Main functionalities of fmcsR

The FMCS algorithm can be called in R from the fmcs function, which
computes either the MCS or FMCS shared among two compounds and
returns the result as an object of class S4 containing one or many alter-
native solutions. The speed-optimizedfmcsBatch function provides MCS/
FMCS-based search functionalities of small molecule databases. The
number of allowable atom/bond mismatches and ring matching policies
are user-deﬁnable parameters. A plotting function is available to visualize
MCS/FMCS results by color highlighting the corresponding bonds in
their source structures. A detailed user manual is included in the fmcsR
package.

3 RESULTS

Figure 1B and C compare the performance of fmcsR with the
MCS algorithm implemented in the SMSD toolkit (Rahman
et al., 2009). With perfect matching (FMCS00 in Fig. 1B), the
FMCS algorithm returns MCSs with similar size distributions as
SMSD, but with shorter compute times (Fig. 1C). Slight differ-
ences in the MCS size distributions among the two methods are
as expected owing to (i) differences in their perception and
matching behavior of rings and aromatic bonds, (ii) different
heuristics used for improving time performance and (iii) different
MCS concepts considered by the two methods (for details see
Supplementary Materials S1; Cao et al., 2008a; Rahman et al.,
2009). For extremely large compounds, above 60 non-hydrogen
atoms, SMSD switches to a faster approximation approach
where it exhibits a better time performance than FMCS in its
perfect matching mode. When allowing 1, 2 or 3 mismatches of
bonds and atoms, the size distributions of the FMCS results
increase on average by 20—50% compared with the strict MCS
results. On average these size increases substantially exceed the
number of allowed mismatches because a mismatch will often
allow the algorithm to identify many additional matching bonds
and atoms resulting in an FMCS of a much larger size than the
corresponding MCS. For instance, the MCS shared among
diethyl ether and diethyl sulﬁde contains only two non-hydrogen
atoms, but their FMCS with one atom mismatch contains ﬁve
non-hydrogen atoms (Fig. 1A). With relaxed mismatch param-
eters, the complexity of the FMCS computation increases, result-
ing in longer processing times. Nevertheless, for 1—2 atom and
bond mismatches the compute times are still acceptable across
the six compound size bins considered in Figure 1C. In virtual
screening (VS) benchmark tests, the FMCS method shows con-
sistently better performance than strict MCS matching (Fig. 1D
and E), indicating that the mismatch tolerant MCS similarity
concept improves the early and late enrichment performance of
MCS-based search methods in VS experiments (Good and
Oprea, 2008; Huang et al., 2006). The strong overall performance
of FMCS, compared with a diverse set of seven 2D and 3D
structure similarity search algorithms (Chen and Reynolds,
2002; Jahn et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2011; Wale et al., 2010), dem-
onstrates its usefulness for this application ﬁeld. The details
for these extensive VS performance tests are provided in the
Supplementary Materials S2.

4 CONCLUSIONS

The fmcsR package introduces a versatile algorithm for identify-
ing both MCSs and FMCSs. Its mismatch tolerant matching

mode provides a more complete description of subtle similarity
patterns shared among compounds than this is possible with

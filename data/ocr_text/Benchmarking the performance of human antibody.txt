ABSTRACT

Motivation: lmmunoglobulin heavy chain genes are formed by
recombination of genes randomly selected from sets of IGHV, IGHD
and IGHJ genes. Utilities have been developed to identify genes that
contribute to observed VDJ rearrangements, but in the absence of
datasets of known rearrangements, the evaluation of these utilities
is problematic. We have analyzed thousands of VDJ rearrangements
from an individual (S22) whose IGHV, IGHD and IGHJ genotype can
be inferred from the dataset. Knowledge of this genotype means that
the Stanford_S22 dataset can serve to benchmark the performance
of IGH alignment utilities.

Results: We evaluated the performance of seven utilities. Failure
to partition a sequence into genes present in the S22 genome was
considered an error, and error rates for different utilities ranged from
7.1% to 13.7%.

Availability: Supplementary data includes the S22 genotypes and
alignments. The Stanford_S22 dataset and an evaluation tool is
available at http://www.emi.unsw.edu.au/~ihmmune/|GHUtilityEval/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Effective responses to the antigenic diversity of the microbial world
require the human immune system to produce antibodies with
speciﬁcities of similar diversity. The genetic diversity necessary to
encode such an antibody repertoire is generated by recombination,
for immunoglobulin genes are created by the joining of a number
of genes. As each B cell develops within the bone marrow, the
rearranged immunoglobulin heavy chain (IGH) variable region
genes are created by essentially random recombination of single
IGHV (V), IGHD (D) and IGHJ (J) genes, each selected from sets
of germline genes (Jung et al., 2006). During the recombination
process, the recombining gene ends can be trimmed, and variable
numbers of non-template encoded nucleotides may be inserted
between the recombining genes. Additional diversity is generated
during an immune response by the process of somatic hypermutation
(SHM) (Neuberger, 2008), which can lead a rearranged VDJ gene
of around 370 nts to accumulate in excess of 30 point mutations.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The processes of VDJ recombination and SHM, when combined
with the high similarity of many of the genes, lead to difﬁculty in
identifying the germline contributions to IGH rearrangements. This
is particularly true of the D genes, which range in length from just
11—37 nt.

A number of utilities have been developed to identify the germline
origins of VDJ rearrangements. We have previously used sets of
clonally related sequences to evaluate such utilities (Gaeta et al.,
2007). This provided a useful test, but as rearrangements with
differing characteristics (long D, short D, highly mutated, etc.)
present different challenges for the utilities, larger and more varied
datasets are required for proper evaluation.

Here we present an evaluation of IGH alignment utilities based on
alignment of large 454 sequencing datasets from single individuals.
The method is explored using the Stanford_S22 dataset. The many
thousands of VDJ rearrangements in this dataset allow the individual
genotype at the IGH variable gene loci to be inferred (Boyd et al.,
2010). By assessing the number of alignments made to genes that
are absent from the individual genotype using our evaluation tool,
such datasets of rearrangements can be used for evaluation and
improvement of IGH alignment utilities.

2 METHODS

The Stanford_S22 dataset of VDJ sequences was produced by 454 pyro-
sequencing of genomic DNA derived from peripheral blood mononuclear
cells of a single individual, as previously described (Boyd et al., 2009).
Apparent chimeric sequences (Brakenhoff et al., 1991) and those containing
base pair insertions and deletions were identiﬁed and excluded. Chimeric
sequences were identiﬁed by BLAST alignments against the germline
V repertoire. Chimeric sequences had disparate 5’ and 3’ portions of their
rearranged V genes. Clonally related sets were also identiﬁed and a single
representative sequence from each set was retained in the dataset.

The dataset of 13 153 sequences was aligned using iHMMune—align (Gaeta
et al., 2007), IMGT/V—QUEST+JCTA (Brochet et al., 2008), J OINSOLVER
(Souto-Cameiro et al., 2004), SODA (Volpe et al., 2006), VD] solver (Ohm-
Laursen et al., 2006), Ab-origin (Wang et al., 2008a) and NCBI’s IgBLAST.
All alignments were completed using each utility’s default parameters and
germline repertoires. The iHMMune—align repertoire includes a number of
putative polymorphisms not present in the repertoires of other utilities. The
S22 genotype was then determined as previously described (Boyd et al.,
2010) by independent analysis of results from iHMMune-align, IMGT/V-
QUEST+JCTA and IgBLAST.

The percentages of V, D and J alignments made to genes and alleles
absent from the S22 genotype were then determined for each utility. As
the S22 genotype includes putative polymorphisms that are only found in
the iHMMune—align repertoire, alignments of sequences containing such

polymorphisms were considered correct if a utility identiﬁed the most similar
allele within its repertoire. Although IGHD5-5 may be missing from the S22
genome, alignments tO IGHD5-5 were accepted as correct, as IGHD5-5 and
IGHD5-18 have identical coding regions. For utilities that report a number
Of possible V, D and J genes, only the highest scoring genes were included
in the analysis. If a number Of genes achieved the same high score, and
these equally high scoring genes included an S22 gene, then the alignments
were accepted as correct. For utilities that reported a single possible gene,
or where there was only a single high scoring gene, if this gene was absent
from the S22 genome the alignment was considered incorrect. Alignments
tO inverse D genes were considered incorrect given the evidence challenging
their involvement in the generation Of diversity (Corbett et al., 1997), and
given that review Of the SODA inverse D alignments demonstrated them tO
be invariably short and improbable (data not shown).

3 DISCUSSION

NO VDJ rearrangement can be partitioned with absolute certainty,
but any alignment made tO genes that are absent from the genome Of
the individual under study must be in error. This study did not attempt
tO identify all incorrect alignments, but rather it detected errors by
reference tO an individual’s inferred genotype, providing a measure
Of the minimum frequency Of misalignments for each utility. The
S22 genotype was independently determined using three utilities.
These genotypes were found tO be in agreement, with the exception
Of minor differences resulting from the presence Of allelic variants
in the S22 genotype that are not present in all repertoires, and
misalignment Of very infrequently rearranged genes. The inferred
rearrangeable V, D and J genes Of the S22 genome are available as
Supplementary Tables S1, S2 and S3, respectively. S22 carries an
apparent homozygous deletion Of six contiguous D genes (Boyd
et al., 2010) and is homozygous at the ﬁve other D loci where
allelic variants exist. The IGHD6-25 gene, which we have previously
suggested is non-functional (Lee et al., 2006), was also absent from
the S22 genome. These features make the S22 dataset particularly
useful for the evaluation Of utility performance on D gene alignment.
The alignment Of D genes is one Of the most difﬁcult challenges in the
partitioning Of VDJ rearrangements and the nature Of the challenge
varies between D gene families.

The output from each utility was compared with the S22 genotype,
and all errors were noted. The results for each utility are summarised
as Table 1 and detailed as Supplementary Tables S4—S10. Overall,
errors were made in the alignment Of between 7.1% (iHMMune—
align) and 13.7% (Ab-origin) Of all sequences. Six unofﬁcial V
polymorphisms, previously inferred from sequence analysis (Boyd
et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2008b), are seen in the S22 genome.
These polymorphisms were present in 9.4% Of all S22 VDJ
genes, according tO the iHMMune—align analysis. While failures tO
identify these polymorphisms were not scored as errors here, unless
alignment utility repertoires incorporate these newly identiﬁed
polymorphisms, an additional source Of substantial error will remain.

4 CONCLUSION

Analysis using the Stanford_S22 dataset demonstrates how 454
sequence datasets can be used tO evaluate the performance Of
IGH alignment utilities. Analysis found the fewest deﬁnitive mis-
assignments Of the IGH genes for iHMMune—align, J OINSOLVER
and IgBLAST. This approach should now allow the performance Of
all utilities tO be further reﬁned.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Pinpointing genes that underlie human inherited
diseases among candidate genes in susceptibility genetic regions
is the primary step towards the understanding of pathogenesis of
diseases. Although several probabilistic models have been proposed
to prioritize candidate genes using phenotype similarities and
protein—protein interactions, no combinatorial approaches have been
proposed in the literature.

Results: We propose the first combinatorial approach for prioritizing
candidate genes. We first construct a phenome—interactome network
by integrating the given phenotype similarity profile, protein—protein
interaction network and associations between diseases and genes.
Then, we introduce a computational method called MAXIF to
maximize the information flow in this network for uncovering genes
that underlie diseases. We demonstrate the effectiveness of this
method in prioritizing candidate genes through a series of cross-
validation experiments, and we show the possibility of using this
method to identify diseases with which a query gene may be
associated. We demonstrate the competitive performance of our
method through a comparison with two existing state-of-the-art
methods, and we analyze the robustness of our method with respect
to the parameters involved. As an example application, we apply our
method to predict driver genes in 50 copy number aberration regions
of melanoma. Our method is not only able to identify several driver
genes that have been reported in the literature, it also shed some new
biological insights on the understanding of the modular property and
transcriptional regulation scheme of these driver genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although the past few decades have evidenced many successful
stories of identifying genetic variants that underlie human inherited
diseases through statistical methods such as linkage analysis and
association studies (Botstein and Risch, 2003), uncovering genes
that are truly associated with these diseases from susceptibility
genetic regions obtained by these statistical analyses still remain
as a great challenge and appeal for the development of effective
computational methods (Glazier et al., 2002; Lander and Schork,
1994).

To tackle this problem, several approaches have been proposed
from the viewpoint of one—class novelty learning. For example, the
‘guilt—by—direct—association’ principle suggests ranking candidate

genes in a susceptibility region according to their relevance to
genes that are already known as associated with the disease under
investigation. Based on this principle, a wide variety of information,
including protein sequences (Adie et al., 2005; Aerts et al., 2006),
gene expression proﬁles (Aerts et al., 2006; Franke et al., 2006;
van Driel et al., 2003), functional annotations (Franke et al.,
2006; Freudenberg and Propping, 2002; Perez—Iratxeta et al., 2002;
Turner et al., 2003), literature descriptions (Aerts et al., 2006;
Gaulton et al., 2007; van Driel et al., 2003), protein—protein
interactions (PPI) (Aerts et al., 2006; Franke et al., 2006; Kohler
et al., 2008; Oti et al., 2006) and many others (Oti and Brunner,
2007), has been used to facilitate the prioritization of candidate
genes.

Recently, a number of studies have also suggested the ‘guilt—by—
indirect—association’ principle, which resorts to the modular nature
of human genetic diseases (Goh et al., 2007; Lim et al., 2006; Oti
and Brunner, 2007; van Driel et al., 2006; Wagner et al., 2007; Wood
et al., 2007) and utilizes PPI information and similarities between
disease phenotypes with a variety of computational models to infer
genes that are truly associated with diseases (Lage et al., 2007; Li
and Patra, 2010; Vanunu et al., 2010; Wu et al., 2008, 2009). For
example, Lage et al. proposed a Bayesian model to integrate PPI
and phenotype similarities (Lage et al., 2007). Wu et al. developed
a regression model to explain phenotype similarities using gene
proximities (Wu et al., 2008). Wu et al. (2009) also proposed
to align the phenotype network against the PPI network. Li and
Patra utilized a random walk model called an RWRH to simulate
the stationary distribution of the strength of associations for genes
(Li and Patra, 2010). Vanunu et al. (2010) proposed a network
propagation method called PRINCE to mimic the sharing of disease
status among genes. These recent methods not only exhibit the state—
of—the—art performance, but also open the possibility of identifying
genes that are responsible for diseases, whose genetic bases are
completely unknown.

The success of the above methods relies largely on the use of PPI
networks for estimating functional similarities between genes (Wu
et al., 2008). The functional similarities between a pair of genes
are typically measured by using the shortest path between genes
in a PPI network (Dezso et al., 2009; Managbanag et al., 2008;
Sharan et al., 2007; Sun and Zhao, 2010). Since the shortest path
measure considers only a single optimal path between a pair of
genes and overlooks all other paths, the reliability of the optimal
path and the robustness of the resulting method may therefore
be adversely affected. Moreover, most of the above methods are
based on probabilistic models, which are typically very computation

intensive. On the other hand, although it has been demonstrated
before that the effect of a gene on its associated diseases may
‘propagate’ through connections in a PPI network to other genes
and eventually contribute to the status of associations between these
genes and the diseases (Schadt, 2009; Taylor et al., 2009; Vanunu
et al., 2010), systematic studies on this notion from the viewpoint
of combinatorial optimization have not yet been reported in the
literature.

Motivated by these observations, we propose a novel
combinatorial approach for prioritizing candidate disease genes in
this paper. Our approach ﬁrst constructs a phenome—interactome
network by integrating the given phenotype similarity proﬁle, PPI
network and associations between diseases and genes. Then, we
model the strength of association between a query disease and
a candidate gene using the amount of information that can ﬂow
from the disease to the gene, and we develop a method called
MAXIF that maximizes the information ﬂow in the phenome—
interactome network to prioritize candidate genes in susceptibility
genetic regions. We show the competitive performance of our
method through a series of carefully designed cross—validation
experiments and comparison with the state—of—the—art methods in
the literature, and we demonstrate its robustness to the parameters
introduced. As an example case study, we describe a successful
application of our method in predicting driver genes in 50 copy
number aberration (CNA) regions of melanoma.

2 METHODS

2.1 Construction of the phenome—interactome network

The phenome—interactome network is constructed by integrating a phenotype
similarity proﬁle, a PPI network and known associations between genes and
diseases.

First, the phenotype similarity proﬁle, represented as a matrix of similarity
scores between 5080 human disease phenotypes, is obtained from the
literature (van Driel et al., 2006). Since most small similarity scores in this
proﬁle are likely to be noise and only high scores have clear biological
meanings (van Driel et al., 2006), we introduce a threshold or and only keep
similarity scores that are greater than or equal to this threshold. Consequently
we obtain a weighted phenotype similarity network, in which vertices are
disease phenotypes and weighted edges indicate similarity scores between
the vertices incident to the edge. We refer to this phenotype similarity
network as the phenome. Second, the PPI network is obtained from release
9 of the Human Protein Reference Database (HPRD) (Peri et al., 2003).
After removing duplications and self—linked interactions, we obtain 37 064
manually curated interactions between 9515 human genes. We refer to this
PPI network as the interactome. Third, we use the tool BioMart (Smedley
et al., 2009) to extract 2496 known associations that involve 1460 genes in
the interactome and 1609 diseases in the phenome.

With these data sources, we construct the phenome—interactome network
as a heterogeneous network, whose vertices include all diseases in the
phenome and all genes in the interactome, and whose edges include all
edges in the phenome, all interactions in the interactome and all known
associations between diseases in the phenome and genes in the interactome.
We further specify for each edge in the phenome—interactome network a
capacity value, a real number that indicates our conﬁdence on the connection
between the vertices incident to the edge. For each edge in the phenome,
we deﬁne its associated similarity score as its capacity. For each edge
between the phenome and the interactome, we deﬁne its capacity as 6, a
real number ranging from 0 to the positive inﬁnity. For each edge in the
interactome, we deﬁne its capacity as y, a real number ranging from 0
to the positive inﬁnity. By default, we set the values of the parameters as

0120.3, 6: 10000 (in lieu of the positive inﬁnity) and y: 1. With these
deﬁnitions, the phenome—interactome network is denoted as an undirected
graph G=(V,E), where V is the set of vertices and E is the set of edges.
Each edge (u, v) has a positive capacity value C(u, v) as deﬁned above.

2.2 Maximizing the information ﬂow to prioritize
candidate genes

Our objective is to uncover genes that are associated with a query disease
of interest from a set of candidate genes. For this purpose, we introduce a
method called MAXimum Information Flow (MAXIF) that makes use of
the phenome—interactome network to calculate an association score for each
candidate gene, and then ranks the candidate genes according to their scores.
We illustrate MAXIF in Figure 1 and present the details below.

The input of our method includes a query disease d, a set of candidate
genes S and the phenome—interactome network G=(V, E) with capacity
c(u,v) assigned to each pair of vertices. We ﬁrst convert the undirected
network G into a directed graph G/ by treating each undirected edge (u, v) e E
as two distinct directed edges (u, v) and (v, u). The resulting directed graph is
then G/=(V, E/) with E: {(u, v):(u, v) eE}U{(v, u):(u, v) 6E} being the
set of directed edges. We further deﬁne the capacity function c/ in this directed
graph as c’ (u, v) = c’ (v, u) = C(u, v) if (u, v) e E. Then, we incorporate a source
vertex 5 and introduce a directed edge of inﬁnite capacity pointing from the
source sto the vertex corresponding to the query disease (i.e. d). Similarly,
we incorporate a sink vertex t and introduce for each candidate gene u e S,
a directed edge of inﬁnite capacity pointing from vertex u to the sink t.
Finally, we obtain a directed graph G” = (V” , E”), where V” = VU {5, t} and
E” =E/ U{(s, d)} U {(u, t): u e S}. We further deﬁne the capacity function G”
as c”(u, v)=c’(u, v) for all (u, v)eE/, c”(s, d)=oo and c”(u, t)=oo for
all u e S.

It is obvious that the graph G” = (V”, E”) is a ﬂow network if both the
phenome and interactome are connected, and there is at least one known
association between each gene in the interactome and some disease in the
phenome (in order to ensure that every vertex lies on some path from
the source to the sink). Specially, we refer to G” as an information ﬂow
network, and we deﬁne an information ﬂow in such a network as a real—
valued function f: V” x V” —> R. We interpret an information ﬂow f as a
scheme of distributing the total amount of information injected from the
source s over all edges in the ﬂow network G” such that the total amount of
information leaving the source is equal to the total amount of information
entering the sink. In other words, [fl = Evevn f (s, v) = Zuevn f (u, t), where [fl
is referred to as the value of ﬂow f. Moreover, we require that an information
ﬂow f should satisfy (i) capacity constraint [i.e. f (u,v) 5c” (u,v) for all u,
v e V”]; (ii) skew symmetry [i.e. f(u,v)= —f(v, u) for all u, v e V”] and (iii)
ﬂow conservation [i.e. Evevnf(u,v)=0 for all ueV” —{s, t}]. It is clear
that the total information that can be injected from the source is determined
by the value of the information ﬂow [i.e. [fl = Evevn f (s, v)] in the network.
Therefore, the ﬂow with the maximum value is of particular interest, because
such a ﬂow allows the maximal possible injection of information from the
source. Following the literature (Andrew and Goldberg, 1998), a ﬂow with
the maximum value can be efﬁciently calculated using the push—relabel or
the binary blocking ﬂow algorithm. Note that when using this algorithm,
we have to multiply all capacities in the ﬂow network by a large number
(e. g. 10 000) and round the resulting capacities to integers.

Once the maximum information ﬂow f * has been calculated, we deﬁne
for each candidate gene vertex u e S the total amount of net ﬂow leaving it
as le = Evevnﬂwbofﬁu, v) and we use the value of this positive ﬂow as
a score to indicate the strength of the association between it and the query
disease d. Furthermore, we can rank all candidate genes according to their
scores to obtain a ranked list.

The proposed MAXIF method can be easily modiﬁed to meet the
requirement of other applications in the study of relationships between
diseases and genes. For example, as an inverse problem of prioritizing
candidate genes, biologists may be interested in ﬁxing a query gene and
ranking a set of candidate diseases according to the possibility that the

Fig. 1. Illustration of the MAXIF method. The phenome—interactome network is constructed by integrating the given phenotype similarity proﬁle, PPI network
and associations between diseases and genes. By maximizing the information ﬂow in the phenome—interactome network, the strength of association between
a query disease and a candidate gene is calculated as the net ﬂow leaving the gene. Candidate genes are then prioritized according to their association strength
scores. The numbers on each edge indicate the ﬂow/capacity values of the edge. Only ﬂows with positive values are shown.

query gene is associated with the diseases. To solve this problem, we
can simply construct the information ﬂow network from the phenome—
interactome network by again introducing a source, a sink, a directed edge
of inﬁnite capacity pointing from the source to the query gene and a set
of directed edges of inﬁnite capacity pointing from candidate diseases to
the sink. With this construction and the efﬁcient algorithm for solving the
maximum—ﬂow problem, we can conveniently obtain association scores for
candidate diseases as the total amount of net ﬂow leaving the diseases and
then rank the diseases according to their scores.

2.3 Validation methods and evaluation criteria

We perform two leave—one—out cross—validation experiments to examine the
capability of our method in uncovering genes that are known to be associated
with certain diseases (i.e. disease genes) from a set of candidates. First, in
the validation against random genes, we take a known association between
a gene and a disease in each run, assume the association is unknown and
prioritize the gene against a set of 99 control genes that are selected at
random from all genes in the interactome. Second, in the validation against
a linkage interval, we select control genes in each validation run as all genes
that are located within the 10 Mb region centered around the disease gene
under consideration.

It is possible that a disease is associated with multiple genes. This
situation is common for complex diseases. Intuitively, the inclusion of known
relationships between a query disease and all its associated genes may
facilitate the identiﬁcation of novel genes that are associated with the disease.
To eliminate such a confounding factor, we perform ab initio predictions to
examine the capability of our method in discovering genes that are associated
with a disease whose genetic basis is completely unknown. Speciﬁcally, in
an ab initio prediction, we consider a known association between a gene
and a disease, assume the association is unknown and prioritize the gene
against a set of control genes. In this procedure, we also remove all known
associations between the disease and other genes. Similar to the leave—one—
out cross—validation experiments, we also use two control sets, random genes
and a linkage interval.

To examine the performance of our method in prioritizing candidate
diseases for a ﬁxed query gene, we perform the following leave—one—
out cross—validation experiment. In each validation run, we take a known
association between a gene and a disease, assume the association is unknown
and prioritize the disease against a set of 99 diseases that are selected at

random from all diseases in the phenome. Again, to eliminate the potential
confounding factor caused by known associations between a disease and
multiple genes, we also perform the ab initio prediction experiment.

We will use three measures to evaluate the performance of the proposed
method. Taking the cross—validation against random genes as an example,
after each validation run, we are able to obtain a ranked list. We then calculate
rank ratios of genes by dividing their ranks with the number of genes in
the list. For a set of validation runs, we can then calculate the following
measure. First, we calculate the proportion of top ranking disease genes
and call this measure the precision (PRE). Second, we calculate the mean
rank ratio (MRR) of all disease genes as the average of rank ratios of all
disease genes in the validation runs. Third, given a threshold of rank ratio,
we calculate the sensitivity as the fraction of disease genes ranked above the
threshold and the speciﬁcity as the fraction of control genes ranked below
the threshold. Varying the threshold value from 0.0 to 1.0, we are able to
draw a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and further calculate
the area under this curve (AUC). Obviously, larger PRE/AUC values and
smaller MRR value indicate higher performance of a prioritization method.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Performance of the proposed method

Under the default parameter setting (or 20.3, ,8 = 10000 and y :1),
we obtain a heterogeneous phenome—interactome network that is
composed of 1609 diseases, 9515 genes and 209 983 edges (169 973
between diseases, 37 064 between genes and 2946 between diseases
and genes). Using this network, we examine the performance of the
proposed method in uncovering disease genes from a set of candidate
genes.

We perform leave—one—out cross—validation experiments against
random genes and a linkage interval, and evaluate the results in
terms of AUC, PRE and MRR as described above. The results are
presented in Figure 2A and B and Table l (the column under 0.3),
from which we can see that the proposed method is effective in
uncovering known associations between genes and diseases. For
example, in the leave—one—out cross—validation against a linkage
interval, an AUC score is as high as 95.66%, PRE is as high as

60.14% and an MRR is as low as 3.88%. In the validation against
random genes, the AUC score is 90.76%, PRE is 56.89% and the
MRR is 10.02%.

To eliminate the potential confounding effect caused by the
association between a disease and multiple genes, we perform
ab initio prediction experiments against random genes and a linkage
interval, and present the results in Figure 2A and B. We can see from
this ﬁgure that the proposed method is also effective in uncovering
known associations between genes and diseases, even for diseases
whose genetic basis is completely unknown. (Recall that in the
ab initio prediction, we completely remove all known associations
between the query disease and other genes.) For example, in the
ab initio prediction against a linkage interval, the AUC score is as
high as 94.60%, PRE is as high as 59.46% and the MRR is as low
as 4.67%. In the validation against random genes, the AUC score
is 89.26%, PRE is 55.69 and MRR is as low as 13.57%. It is not
surprising that the performance of the ab initio results are somewhat
lower than the corresponding leave—one—out cross—validation results,
since the inclusion of genes that are already known to be associated
with the query disease should facilitate the discovery of additional

genes associated with the disease. However, we can still see the
effectiveness of the proposed method in this (more strict) ab initio
prediction experiments. In other words, the proposed method is
capable of uncovering genes that are associated with diseases, whose
genetic bases are completely unknown. This is important because,
according to the OMIM database, the genetic bases for about half of
the diseases are completely unknown. Our method can then be used
to predict potential associations between genes and these diseases.

To meet the requirement of the applications whose objective is to
identify for a ﬁxed query gene all diseases with which the gene might
be associated, we perform both the leave—one—out cross—validation
and ab initio prediction against random diseases. The results are
presented in Figure 2C, from which we can see the effectiveness
of the proposed method in identifying diseases that are associated
with the given query gene. For example, in the leave—one—out cross—
validation, the AUC score is as high as 90.65%, PRE is as high as
22.44% and the MRR is as low as 9.47%.

The above validation results demonstrate that the proposed
method can successfully rank the gene that is truly associated with
the query disease at the top among all the candidates. It would
be interesting to know if the correct prioritization is really due to
the connectivity information included in the phenome—interactome
network (instead of some biases present in the network). For this
purpose, we perform three permutation experiments by (i) shufﬂing
interactions in the phenome while ﬁxing the degree (i.e. number of
neighbours of each vertex) distribution of the network, (ii) shufﬂing
interactions between diseases and genes while ﬁxing the number
of associated genes for each of the diseases and (iii) shufﬂing the
interactome while ﬁxing the degree distribution of the network.
We repeat the leave—one—out cross—validation experiments using
the shufﬂed networks and present the results in Figure 2. The
AUC scores are all around 50% in the ﬁgure, and we therefore
conclude that the above successful prioritization of candidate genes
is indeed due to the informative interactions that are included in the
phenome—interactome network.

3.2 Robustness of the proposed method

There are three parameters in the process of constructing the
phenome—interactome network. The parameter or, ranging from 0

to 1, determines the minimum meaningful similarity score between
two diseases, and thus controls the sparsity of the phenome. The
parameter ,8, ranging from 0 to the positive inﬁnity, determines
the capacity values corresponding to associations between diseases
and genes and thus controls the amount of information that can be
pumped from the phenome to the interactome, or vice versa. The
parameter y, ranging from 0 to the positive inﬁnity, determines
the capacity of each edge in the interactome and thus controls
the information that can ﬂow from genes to genes. Obviously,
enumerating all possible combinations of these parameters is
prohibitive. We therefore study the effect of each parameter
individually, while ﬁxing the other parameters in a test.

We ﬁrst plot the histogram of the similarity scores between
diseases and ﬁnd that the probability density of the similarity scores
has a clear positive skewness, indicating that most scores tend to be
small. Hence, we conclude that the parameter or should not be set too
small for the purpose of ﬁltering out noise in the phenome. We then
perform a grid search on or from 0.1 to 0.5 with step 0.1, and present
the results in Table 1. From the table, we can see that the proposed
method is robust with respect to this parameter. For example, when
different values of or are applied, the AUC score ﬂuctuates within
a 1.1% band in the leave—one—out cross—validation against a linkage
interval. In the validation against random genes, the AUC score
ﬂuctuates within a 2.3% band when or is <0.5. However, it shows a
signiﬁcant drop of about 8% when or reaches 0.5. In the validation
against random diseases, we observe the similar trend. From these
observations, we conclude that the parameter or should not be set too
large either. Therefore, we recommend to set or = 0.3 in our method.

The parameter ,8 determines the capacity of each edge going
from the phenome to the interactome or in the reverse direction.
Intuitively, this parameter should be set at a large value in order to
ensure that all information injected from the source can be pumped
from the phenome to the interactome. In our studies, we perform a
grid search on ﬁve values of ,8: l, 10, 100, 1000 and 10 000 (in lieu
of the positive inﬁnity), and we present the results in Table 2. From
the table, we can see that our proposed method is quite robust with
respect to this parameter. For example, when different values of ,8 are
applied, the AUC score ﬂuctuates within a 2.4% band in the leave—
one—out cross—validation against a linkage interval. In the validation
against random genes, the AUC score ﬂuctuates within a 2.9% band

with different values of ,8 being applied. In the validation against
random diseases, the AUC score ﬂuctuates within a 1.9% band with
different values of ,8 being applied. From these observations, we
conclude that the parameter ,8 can be set in a wide range without
affecting the performance of our method very much. Therefore, we
recommend to set ,8 = 10000 (in lieu of the positive inﬁnity) in our
method for the sake of simplicity.

In the construction of the phenome—interactome network, we
convert an undirected association between diseases and genes into
two directed edges in opposite directions to allow for unrestricted
information transmission in both directions. It might be argued that
edges between the phenome and the interactome should all point
from diseases to genes but not vice versa, since information is
injected from the source and should ﬂow towards the genes. To
study the difference of these two different connection schemes,
we remove all edges linking genes to diseases in the phenome—
interactome network and repeat the leave—one—out cross—validation
experiment against random genes. The results show that the AUC
score is 90.71%, with PRE being 49.98% and the MRR being
10.14%. When compared with the previous results, where edges go
from both diseases to genes and genes to diseases (AUC = 95.66%,
PRE=56.89% and MRR: 10.02%), we see only a slight drop in
performance. Therefore, we conclude that the proposed method is
robust with respect to the scheme of constructing the phenome—
interactome network.

The parameter y determines the capacity of each edge between
genes in the interactome. To study the effect of this parameter,
we perform a grid search on 11 values of y, including 1 and the
values from 10 to 100 with step 10. The results are presented in
Table 3, which exhibit a very small effect of the parameter on the
performance of the proposed method in the leave—one—out cross—
validation. Nevertheless, we still observe that the method usually
achieves the best performance when y is equal to 1. Therefore, we
use y :1 as the default setting in our method.

3.3 Comparison with existing methods

There have been several methods developed to prioritize candidate
genes using both the phenotype similarity proﬁle and the PPI
network. Among these methods, PRINCE (Vanunu et al., 2010) and
RWRH (Li and Patra, 2010) have the state—of—the—art performance.
We therefore repeat leave—one—out cross—validation experiments
against random genes for these two methods (using programs
provided by the authors) and compare their performance with an
MAXIF.

We evaluate the performance using the AUC score and present the
results in Figure 3A. The ﬁgure shows that the ROC curve of MAXIF
lies clearly above those of PRINCE and RWRH. More speciﬁcally,
the AUC scores are 90.76% for MAXIF, 86.84% for PRINCE and
86.94% for RWRH. In addition, the PRE values are 56.89% for
MAXIF, 50.02% for PRINCE and 50.18% for RWRH and the MRR
values are 10.03% for MAXIF, 13.80% for PRINCE and 13.81%
for RWRH.

Another standard method for evaluating the performance of
a prioritization method is to consider the precision—recall curve
(Vanunu et al., 2010). Given the association scores calculated
for candidate genes, we deﬁne positive calls as all genes whose
association scores are higher than a certain threshold and deﬁne the
precision as the proportion of disease genes among the positive calls.

Fig. 3. Comparison with existing methods on leave—one—out cross—validation
experiments against random genes. (A) The ROC curve. (B) The precision—
recall curve.

We deﬁne the recall as the proportion of positively called disease
genes among all disease genes. By varying the threshold value, we
can obtain a series of precision and recall values, which give rise to
a precision—recall curve. We present the precision—recall curves for
MAXIF, PRINCE and RWRH in Figure 3B. The ﬁgure shows that
the curve of MAXIF lies above those of PRINCE and RWRH. We
therefore conclude that the performance of MAXIF is superior to
both PRINCE and RWRH.

We also compare the computational times of the three methods. It
takes 237 s for MAXIF to ﬁnish the leave—one—out cross—validation
experiment against random genes on a workstation with dual AMD
Opteron 2212 CPUs and 4 GB DDR2 memory. In contrast, it takes
840 s for RWRH and more than a day for PRINCE to ﬁnish the same
experiment. We therefore conclude that the MAXIF is faster than
the other two methods.

3.4 Identiﬁcation of driver genes in 50 copy number
aberration regions of melanoma

Copy number aberrations (CNAs), as a typical type of genomic
variation, occur frequently in cancers due to genomic instability
and have great inﬂuence on biological processes involved in many
diseases (Ley et al., 2008; Stratton et al., 2009). Although there have
been quite a few CNA regions predicted in the literature (Craddock
et al., 2010; Kidd et al., 2010), only a small number of genes
in these regions has been examined, suggesting a substantial gap

between genomic aberrations and the understanding of how these
aberrations contribute to diseases (Goldstein, 2009; Kan et al., 2010;
Manolio et al., 2009; McClellan and King, 2010). For example,
an aberrant region of colon cancer in llq23.l includes 17 genes,
among which only one gene, DIXDCl, is conﬁrmed to be involved
in the induction of colon cancer (Wang et al., 2009). It has also
been shown that some genes located in CNA regions are causally
implicated in oncogenesis. These genes, known as ‘driver genes’,
are different from ‘passenger genes’ that have no contribution to the
development of diseases (Akavia et al., 2010; Stratton et al., 2009).
Very recently, a method called CONEXIC has been proposed to scan
CNA regions to uncover driver genes using gene expression data
(Akavia et al., 2010). Since genes in CNA regions can be collected
to form a candidate gene set, we could prioritize these genes using
MAXIF to distinguish driver genes from passenger genes in CNA
regions.

We demonstrate the capability of an MAXIF in predicting driver
genes by a case study on a CNA data set concerning melanoma.
Speciﬁcally, we generate 50 CNA regions, including 23 ampliﬁed
regions and 27 deleted regions, from 62 cultured melanomas (Lin
et al., 2008) using the JISTIC method (Sanchez—Garcia et al., 2010).
Then, for each of these regions, we extract all genes in the region as
candidate driver genes. Finally, we apply MAXIF to prioritize the
candidates, and we predict genes with the top rank as driver genes.
Our prediction has resulted in 47 distinct driver genes from a total
of 428 distinct candidates, as shown in Table 4 and illustrated in
Figure 4.

We ﬁrst analyze functional enrichment of these 47 predicted driver
genes using DAVID (Huang da et al., 2009). The analysis shows that
these genes are involved in a wide variety of biological processes
in melanoma, including transcriptional regulation (including both
activation and suppression), response to DNA damage and
chromosomal instability, metabolic processes, gap junction transport
and signaling and so on. For example, FANC1, TP53BP1 and
RAD51, located on chromosome 15, are all enriched in the function
of response to DNA damage and chromosome instability (Fig. 4).

Among the 47 predicted driver genes, MITF and KLF6 are known
as driver genes in the literature (Akavia et al., 2010; Hoek et al.,
2008; Huh et al., 2010). Speciﬁcally, MITF (the microphthalmia—
associated transcription factor) has been found to act as a master

Fig. 4. The 47 predicted driver genes. Red lines denote ampliﬁed regions and
blue lines denote deleted regions. The genes are involved in several functions,
such as transcriptional regulation (green), DNA damage and chromosomal
instability (blue), metabolism process (deep blue), immune response (deep
red), gap junction transport and signaling (black), neuron differentiation and
development of the nervous system (purple) and others (red).

regulator of the development, function and survival of melanocyte
by modulating various differentiation and cell cycle progression
genes. It has also been demonstrated that an MITF is an ampliﬁed
oncogene in a fraction of human melanomas, and this gene also
plays an oncogenic role in human clear cell sarcoma (Hoek et al.,
2008; Levy et al., 2006). The other gene, KLF6, has recently been
proposed as a tumour suppressor gene in chromosome 10. This
gene is involved in hematopoiesis and adipocyte differentiation and
could potentially promote melanocyte differentiation (Huh et al.,
2010; Santiago—Walker and Herlyn, 2010). Our method also predicts
RAB 3C and RAB27A as driver genes. These two genes are members
of the RAS oncogene family, which is involved in melanoma
signaling through the RAS—MAPK pathway (Levy et al., 2006).
Moreover, it has been shown that the silencing of the MITF leads to
a dramatic decrease in the expression of RAB27A (Chiaverini et al.,
2008; Jordens et al., 2006).

In addition, we ﬁnd that 14 of the predicted driver genes are
reported as associated with some diseases in the OMIM database,
and 40 are reported as associated with some diseases in GeneCards
(Safran et al., 2003). We also ﬁnd that these predicted driver genes
often interact with other genes to form gene modules, i.e. connected
components composed of driver genes and their direct interacting
partners. For example, FANC1, TNPO3 and DPM1 interact with
other 11 genes to form a large module. Interestingly, these three
proteins all interact with protein BRF2, which is one of the multiple
subunits of the RNA polymerase III transcription factor complex
(Fig. 5). As an illustration, we also include ﬁve other large predicted
modules in Figure 5.

Next, we extract transcription factors of the 47 predicted driver
genes from DAVID and examine whether these genes are co—
regulated. We ﬁnd that these genes and their transcription factors
form a dense transcriptional regulatory network (Fig. 6). The most
enriched transcription factors are P53, NF—kappaBl, NF—kappaB,
PPAR—gammal and PPAR—gamma2, each of which regulates nine
or more genes, suggesting that they are critical in melanoma.

The above results demonstrate the success of the MAXIF in the
prediction of driver genes for CNA regions. Our ﬁndings, such as the
predicted driver genes involved in response to the DNA damage, the
predicted gene modules and the predicted transcriptional regulatory
network, may also shed new biological insights on the understanding
of melanoma.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

In this article, we have proposed a combinatorial approach that
integrates the given phenotype similarity proﬁle, PPI network
and associations between diseases and genes into a phenome—
interactome network, and prioritizes disease genes by maximizing

the information ﬂow in the network. We have demonstrated the
effectiveness and robustness of this method through a series of cross—
validation experiments. As a case study, we presented a successful
application of this method in predicting driver genes for a number
of CNA regions of melanoma.

The novelty of our method and the key to its success lie in the
information ﬂow model which is based on the premise that the
relationship between a query disease and the candidate genes can
be captured by the maximum information ﬂow sent from the query
disease to the genes. Although the shortest path measure has been
widely used to calculate the proximity between genes in the previous
methods (Wu et al., 2008), the measure considers only a single
optimal path while overlooking all other paths. The information ﬂow
method, however, considers implicitly all paths between diseases
and genes, and can thus overcome the limitation of the methods
that rely on the shortest path measure. Moreover, the intrinsic global
optimality of the maximum information ﬂow also makes our method
superior to existing approaches that rely on local search, such as
RWRH and PRINCE (Li and Patra, 2010; Vanunu et al., 2010).

The success of our method also relies on the integration of
multiple data sources (i.e. phenotype similarity and PPI). For
example, when we ran the method without the phenome and
performed the leave—one—out cross—validation against random genes
with only the PPI network and known associations between diseases
and genes, we got an AUC score of 76.19%, which indicates the
indispensible contribution of the phenotype similarity proﬁle.

Our method can be extended in the following aspects. First,
as we have seen the power of integrating the phenome and the
interactome, the integration of other genomic information, such as
gene expression, functional annotations and pathway membership,
may further improve the performance of our method. Technically,
this can be done by either introducing multiple edges in the network,
one for each type of data, between each pair of genes, or by
combining all data sources into a single network using statistical
methods such as the one in (Guan et al., 2008).

Second, our method can also be extended to uncover associations
between protein complexes or biological pathways and human
diseases. This can be done by ﬁrst calculating the total positive ﬂow
leaving all members of a complex (or pathway) as an association
score to indicate the strength of association between the complex (or
pathway, respectively) and the query disease, and then prioritizing
candidate complexes (or pathways, respectively) according to their
scores.

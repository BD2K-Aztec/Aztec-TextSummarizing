ABSTRACT

Motivation: Similarities in core residue packing provide evidence for
divergence or convergence not reported using other methods.
Results: We apply a new method for rapid structure comparison
based on Simplicial Neighborhood Analysis of Protein Packing
(SNAPP) to the diverse structural classification of proteins (SCOP)
oz/ﬂ-class of protein folds. The procedure identifies inter-residue
packing motifs shared by protein pairs from different folds. A
threshold of 0.67 RMSD for all atoms of corresponding residues
ensures inclusion of only highly significant similarities comparable
with those observed for identical catalytic residues in homologues.
Many tertiary packing motifs are shared among the three classical
Rossmannoid folds, as well as thousands of other motifs that
occur in at least two distinct folds. Merging of neighboring packing
motifs facilitated recognition of larger, recurrent substructures or
cores. The anti-codon-binding domain of an archeal aminoacyl-tRNA
synthetase (aaRS) was discovered to possess a packed core in
which eight identical amino acid residues are within 0.55 RMSD
of the comparable structure in the FixJ receiver, a member of the
Rossmannoid family that also includes the CheY signaling protein
and flavodoxin-like proteins. Further investigation identified close
variants of this core in five other Rossmannoid folds, including a
functionally relevant core in Class la aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases.
Although it is possible that the two essentially identical cores in the
ProRS anti-codon-binding domain and the FixJ receiver converged
to the same structure, the consensus core obtained from the
structural and sequence alignments suggests that all the implicated
protein folds descended from a simpler ancestral protein in which
this core provided nucleotide binding and proto-allosteric functions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Demonstrating structural similarities between proteins has long
provided the initial evidence for common structural motifs

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

representing evolutionary divergence or convergence. Most
approaches rely on comparing the arrangement of secondary
structures or other local substructures in 3D (Dror et al., 2003; Holm
and Sander, 1993; Madej et al., 1995; Orengo and Taylor, 1990;
Shindyalov and Bourne, 1998). Considerably less development has
been devoted to identifying more precise structural details.

Comparison methods that focus on precise arrangements of amino
acid residues are usually used to identify catalytic, ion binding and
small molecule binding sites (Barker and Thornton, 2003; Fetrow
and Skolnik, 1998; Fischer et al., 1994; Jambon et al., 2003).
Often, the aim is to recognize similarities across distinct protein
folds for function prediction or active—site comparisons among
homologous protein structures (Fetrow et al., 1999). Such atomic
level comparisons have generally not been extended to features
outside active sites. Yet, as distantly related proteins with different
folds usually have substantial active—site differences, comparing
structural features outside the active sites may yield more deﬁnitive
evidence for divergence from a common ancestor for proteins
with speciﬁc sub—structural motifs. Central to the present work is
identiﬁcation of tertiary contact motifs found in pairs of proteins
from at least two different folds.

The method identiﬁes recurrent tertiary contacts between protein
secondary structure elements. Similarities are observed at the atomic
level of detail where conformations of individual amino acid
residues are repeated in similarly packed arrangements of side chains
on the secondary structure faces. In conventional analyses, the most
regularly repeated features of tertiary contacts observed are residue
pairs separated as (i, i+ 2) in ,B—strands, and as (i, i+ 3) and (i, i+ 4)
on the surface of a—helices (Chothia and J anin, 1982; Chothia et al.,
1977, 1981; Janin and Chothia, 1980). In this work, these residue
pairs will be referred to as secondary structure—coupled residues
(SCRs). SCRs yield ‘knobs—and—holes’ (Crick, 1953) that form
the close—packed interfaces between secondary structure elements.
The regular spacing in sequence and in 3D of SCRs leads to
preferred orientations for the secondary structures in 3D that have
been observed in similar protein structures. Results presented here
demonstrate that tertiary, i.e. non—sequence local arrangements of
residues interacting at the interfaces of secondary structure elements
yield evolutionary clues that cannot be obtained by comparing
one—dimensional motifs.

We analyze the structural classiﬁcation of protein (SCOP) 05/,8—
class of proteins, in which ,B—Ot—ﬂ motifs are repeated to form
layered sandwich structures with helices on both sides of a central,
parallel ,B—sheet. The largest related superfamily of proteins in this

class is the Rossmannoids, which comprises 12 different folds
presumed to be present in the last common ancestor (LCA) of all
organisms (Aravind et al., 2002; Shakhnovich et al., 2003). Many
motifs have been identiﬁed here that connect the three classical
Rossmannoid folds, as well as the others, and many more motifs
have been discovered that are shared by at least two different folds
in the oz/ﬂ—class.

A large, interesting and widely shared motif is a core of eight
residues linking an a—helix to three parallel ,B—strands in ﬂavodoxin—
like (Rossmannoid) fold members, Fix] and CheY, and in the
anti—codon—binding domain of Class II prolyl— and glycyl—tRNA
synthetases and the accessory ,B—subunit of mitochondrial DNA
polymerase y. These two fold families have not been previously
identiﬁed as possessing such detailed similarity. Interestingly, this
core is partially represented in ﬁve other Rossmannoid folds,
including Class I aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases, where it appears
also to serve an allosteric function (Kapustina et al., 2007; Weinreb
et al., 2009). The prevalence of this motif in proteins that bind to
nucleotides, and the presumptive functional importance in Class I
aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases, suggest that a single ancestral protein
may have diverged to form the Rossmannoids and the anti—codon—
binding domain. As the Rossmannoids diverged before the LCA of
all organisms, the detected core similarity would represent one of
the most ancient protein structural modules yet identiﬁed.

2 METHODS

2.1 Database

Five classes from the SCOP 1.73 database guided assembly of a near—
exhaustive collection of representative protein structures from the Protein
Data Bank (Murzin et al., 1995). One protein structure was selected for
each species represented and for every domain in the SCOP oz, 6, 05/6, at + 6
and multi—domain proteins classes. In all, 11 610 fold representatives were
compiled from 9197 structures in SCOP.

2.2 Structure representation and packing
decomposition

All structures were represented by a single—point per residue based on side—
chain centroids. Tetrahedral packing simplices were identiﬁed using SNAPP
(Cammer et al., 2002; Tropsha et al., 2003), which uses Delaunay tessellation
to decompose the set of side—chain centroids into non—overlapping tetrahedra
where four residues form nearest neighbors.

Each four—body contact was represented by combining the single—letter
codes in sequence order with the three distances of sequence separation of
the residues along the chain. Distances used were 2, 3 and 4 for SCRs,
and L for distances greater than four residues of separation. For example,
IILV_2_L_L refers to a Delaunay simplex composed of residues 1511,
1531, 165L and 176V. A four—body pattern that includes at least one SCR
is referred to here as Secondary structure—Coupled Residues And Packing
Environment (SCRAPE). SCRAPES constitute elemental links between
secondary structures and are therefore elementary tertiary packing motifs.
SCRAPES common to at least two different folds were screened to identify
packing arrangements within 0.67A RMSD for all atoms. This degree of
similarity is comparable with similarities in ser—asp—his catalytic triads
among homologous trypsin—like serine proteases (Stark et al., 2003).

2.3 Motif ﬁnding

SCRAPES repeated in protein structures from two different folds initially
were compared geometrically using tetrahedra deﬁned by connecting

side—chain centroids. Motifs were identiﬁed and analyzed using the following
workﬂow:

(1) SCRAPES, i.e. residue side chain centroid tetrahedra, are identiﬁed in
all protein structures in the database using SNAPP based on Delaunay
tetrahedralization.

(2) Tetrahedra with identical residue types and sequence spacing found
in pairs of structures from different folds are superimposed and
compared.

(3) When all—atom RMSD for the four residues in a tetrahedron is
<0.67 A, the tetrahedron is considered to be a motif shared by both
structures.

(4) When neighboring motifs are identiﬁed in the same structure pair,
these motifs are combined to form a composite motif linking the two
structures.

(5) All motifs linking structures in different fold pairs are tabulated and
used for generating similarity networks that graph motif distribution
of among different folds in the database.

Network edges were drawn based on various cut—offs for number of
residues shared. Many of these structure similarity networks were generated
and visualized for subsets of the data. Superimpositions of hundreds of
structure pairs were visualized directly.

3 RESULTS

Protein structures from the SCOP 05/,8—class were analyzed for
SCRAPES in recurring packing motifs that might help discriminate
between evolutionary divergence and convergence. There were
32180 instances of protein structure pairs from different folds
possessing SCRAPE pairs that were within 0.67A RMSD for
all atoms. SCRAPES were combined to form composite motifs,
revealing a total of 18 107 similarities between protein pairs from
distinct folds in the 05/,8—class.

The overall motif distribution can be visualized by drawing
a graph where edges represent the highly signiﬁcant structural
similarities shared by two protein structures. Figure 1A illustrates
the protein structure similarity network obtained for the SCOP
05/,8—class. The network reveals many precise similarities between
proteins from different folds, suggesting many evolutionary
connections between members of the 05/,8—class.

The most prominent feature of the 05/,8 similarity network is
a sub—structure formed from edges connecting the three classical
Rossmannoid folds deﬁned in SCOP: Class 2—NAD(P)—binding
Rossmann; Class 3—FAD/NAD(P)—binding domains; Class 4—
nucleotide—binding domains (Fig. 1B). Figure 1B shows 1841
connections between 0.2 and 0.3, 266 connections between 0.2 and
0.4 and 285 connections between 0.3 and 04. Each edge represents
similarity of at least four residues between fold representatives.

The most signiﬁcant similarities can be observed in graphs that
impose a minimum threshold of similar residues. Figure 1C shows
a graph representing the oz/ﬂ—class connections when at least seven
residues are structurally similar. This network reveals that the
0.23 ﬂavodoxin—like fold (a Rossmannoid) and the 0.26 adenine
nucleotide hydrolase—like fold [a Rossmannoid that includes the
Class I archeal aminoacyl—tRNA synthetase (aaRS) catalytic core]
are connected to the classical Rossmannoids.

The network also shows that the 0.51 anti—codon—binding domain
of Class II aaRS shares a common motif of eight residues with
the FixJ receiver (023). This network illustrates how the method

Fig. 1. Protein structure similarity networks for 01/,8 proteins, classical Rossmannoids and a subset of motifs. (A) Edges were drawn by connecting
representatives of each fold when the two motif structures were within 0.67A RMSD of each other. Each edge represents a similarity of at least four
residues. (B) The structure similarity network is shown for the three classical Rossmannoid fold subsets; a fold is a column of PDB representatives in boxes:
0.2, NAD(P)—binding Rossmann—fold domains; 0.3, the FAD/NAD(P)—binding domain; and 0.4, the nucleotide—binding domain. These classical Rossmannoids
are the most densely connected fold clique of the similarity network in (A). (C) The structure similarity network is shown for the cases when at least
seven residues are shared between the two proteins. The classical Rossmannoids are well—connected, and the remaining connections are to two different
Rossmannoid folds (0.23 and 0.26), as well as the connection between the anti—codon—binding domain of a Class II aminoacyl—tRNA synthetase (0.51) and
0.23, the ﬂavodoxin—like fold (FixJ structure). 0.26 is the adenine nucleotide oz—hydrolase—like fold, which includes the Class I aminoacyl—tRNA synthetase
catalytic core; the representative in the 0.26 box (lqu) is the Class I argininyl—tRNA synthetase. All structures in 1C except the two highlighted by bold boxes
possess at least partial representation of the core identiﬁed in the Rossmannoids and described further in this work.

Rossmannoid folds share anti-codon-binding domain

 

structure resolutions and RMSDs. Despite the stringent cut—off, only
two structures in Figure 1C failed to exhibit this motif.

Pre—computed multiple sequence alignments (MSAs) were
obtained from the conserved domain representatives at NCBI using
the structure sequences as queries to determine the consensus core
positions. Consensus sequences are shown in Table 1. Most positions
followed the structures in Figure 1C closely, although some positions
were represented by nearly equal numbers of similar amino acid
types in the MSAs.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

(i) Four—body simplices afford a valuable extension of graph—
theoretic applications from active site conﬁgurations to a far
broader class of evolutionary problems: SNAPP detects precisely
repeated structural details in many proteins from a nearly exhaustive
representation of protein structures in the SCOP a/B class. The
similarities indicate either evolutionary divergence or convergence.
Although convergence cannot be ruled out, the N—terminal location
and the coincidence of primary, secondary and tertiary structural
similarities (Table 1; Fig. 2A) highlighted here—between classical
Rossmannoids in the protein structure similarity network—are
most naturally interpreted in terms of an early adaptive radiation
and hence of divergent evolution. This interpretation is reinforced
(Shakhnovich et al., 2003) by the fact that divergence could have
been driven by the adaptive radiation of the same primordial
functions of the core motif—nucleotide (phosphate) binding
and conformational switching (Fig. 2B) shared by descendant
Rossmannoid folds.

(ii) Construction of composite packing motifs involving elemental
links between secondary structures affords a new metric for ancient
protein phylogeny: any core motif identiﬁed by our procedure
implicitly comprises many bona ﬁde examples of divergent
evolution represented in the MSAs belonging to each fold family.
Importantly, there is less variation between the motifs in different
fold families in Figure 1C than is evident within single fold families
(i.e. the ArgRS and TrpRS core motifs in Table 1). Comparison of
the core motif in ArgRS and TrpRS illustrates that using a strict
threshold for RMSD and residue identity for identiﬁcation helps
assure signiﬁcance of the motifs identiﬁed, especially in the face of
considerable variation evident in motif instances within consensus
superfamilies.

(iii)One eight—residue motif, in particular, links the N—terminal
,B—a—B cross—over to a downstream ,B—strand especially frequently
in the Rossmannoid family: common amino acids in all seven
topologies are consistently reinforced by the associated MSAs,
raising the possibility that at some time before the LCA, a small
ancestral protein with this N—terminal ,B—a—B cross—over connection
of 30—40 amino acids, tied to a downstream ,B—strand, diverged to
eventually form all Rossmannoids including the Class I aminoacyl—
tRNA synthetases, as well as the anti—codon—binding domain of
Class II aminoacyl—tRNA synthetases for proline and glycine, and
the accessory ,B—subunit of the mitochondrial DNA polymerase y
(Kaguni, 2004). This example, therefore, shows that examining
precisely repeated inter—residue packing arrangements using an
SNAPP—based bioinformatics approach can lead to consistent and
novel inferences about evolutionarily divergent and/or convergent
motifs shared by proteins with similar but distinct folds.

(iv) The motif at the N—terminus of the Rossmann fold has
independently emerged as having important nucleotide—binding and
proto—allosteric functionality. The widespread occurrence of this
motif is especially interesting in light of its consensus association
with nucleotide—binding functions and its likely allosteric behavior
(Fig. 2B). Anti—codon binding by the ProRS domain leads to
structural rearrangement that is likely communicated to the active
site (Yaremchuk et al., 2000). Structural changes in the FixJ motif
upon phosphorylation of D54 complement the rearrangement of
F106 associated with its activation for transcriptional regulation
(Birck et al., 1999), and a similar change occurs in the bacterial
chemotaxis response regulator, CheY (Schuster et al., 2001).
The homologous motif in Class I tryptophanyl—tRNA synthetase
functions in molecular switching that accompanies both induced
ﬁt and catalysis (Kapustina et al., 2007). Mutation (i.e. of F371)
exerts long—range effects on the relative stability of different TrpRS
conformational states and reduces the catalytic contribution of the
Mg2+ ion (Weinreb et al., 2009).

Abstract

Motivation: Biological rhythms, such as rhythms in gene expression controlled by the cell cycle or
the circadian clock, are important in cell physiology. A common type of experiment compares
rhythmicity in tissues or cells either kept under different conditions or having different genotypes.
Such investigations provide insights into underlying mechanisms as well as functions of rhythms.
Results: We present and benchmark a set of statistical and computational methods for this type of
analysis, here termed differential rhythmicity analysis. The methods detect alterations in rhythm
amplitude, phase and signal to noise ratio in one set of measurements compared to another. Using
these methods, we compared circadian rhythms in liver mRNA expression in mice held under two
different lighting conditions: constant darkness and light—dark cycles, respectively. This analysis re—
vealed widespread and reproducible amplitude increases in mice kept in light—dark cycles. Further
analysis of the subset of differentially rhythmic transcripts implied the immune system in media—
ting ambient light—dark cycles to rhythmic transcriptional activities. The methods are suitable for
genome— or proteome—wide studies, and provide rigorous P values against well—defined null
hypotheses.

Availability and Implementation: The methods were implemented as the accompanying R soft—

 

ware package DODR, available on CRAN.

1 Introduction

Biological rhythms in metabolites or mRNA and protein expression
include circadian (daily) rhythms, cell cycle dependent rhythms and
various ultradian rhythms, the latter with periods of at most a few
hours (Ferrell et al., 2011; Hazlerigg and Wagner, 2006; Lin et 61].,
2015 ; Westermark and Lansner, 2003). Our research focus is on cir—
cadian rhythms, which have been extensively studied at the whole
transcriptome level especially in mouse liver and Drosophila. In
mouse liver, thousands of transcripts exhibit rhythmic abundances,
which lead to rhythmic variations in numerous activities and aspects
of cell physiology (Luck and Westermark, 2016).

When investigating mRNA or protein expression on a genome—
wide scale, rhythmic or not, a task is often to compare samples har—
vested from subjects kept under different conditions, undergoing

different treatments, or having different genotypes (all these here—
after termed groups). From each sample, thousands of transcript or
protein abundances may be estimated using technologies such as
microarray expression profiling, RNA sequencing, or mass spec—
trometry. On the data analysis side, this routinely leads to the well—
known differential expression problem (Anders and Huber, 2010;
Ideker et 61]., 2000). In a basic differential expression problem, the
researcher compares transcriptome-, metabolome- or proteome-
wide expression profiles or abundances of two groups, each consist—
ing of a few biological replicates. The objective is to identify metab—
olites, transcripts or proteins whose concentrations or expression
levels are significantly different between the two groups.

For studies on biological rhythms on a transcriptome—, metabo—
lome— or proteome—wide scale, samples are typically harvested from

animals at different time points over a time span covering one or
more period lengths. When studying circadian rhythms, this entails,
for instance, harvesting samples every 2, 3 or 4 h over a time span of
24 or 48 h. Samples are often taken from animals either synchron-
ized to 12h light/12 h dark cycles, or they may be taken from ani—
mals kept in constant darkness. The former condition allows
detection of rhythms that are generated by the cellular core circa—
dian clock (a small network of transcription factors inﬂuencing their
own expression present in all cells), by the central circadian system
acting upon the tissue (in mammals the central system consists of the
suprachiasmatic nuclei in the hypothalamus), or directly by the light
cues via various mechanisms (Husse et 61]., 2015). The latter condi—
tion allows the isolation of rhythms generated by the intrinsic circa—
dian clock, either the cellular clock or the central circadian system.

In this way, thousands of time series of features are obtained.
These time series have to be analyzed statistically to isolate features
whose levels vary in a circadian fashion. Suitable statistical tests,
such as parametric harmonic regression method (Cornelissen,
2014), spectral based methods (Wijnen et 61]., 2005), or non—
parametric methods such as JTK_CYCLE (Hughes et 61]., 2010) or
RAIN (Thaben and Westermark, 2014), are employed for this pur—
pose. Many other methods exist, as reviewed previously (Doherty
and Kay, 2010). These tests result in a P value for each feature (e.g.
transcript) for the null hypothesis that its expression level does not
vary in a rhythmic fashion. P values are then corrected for multiple
testing, and the investigator may then isolate a set of rhythmic tran-
scripts of interest with a specified false discovery rate (FDR).
Parametric methods are able to detect weaker rhythms (they are
more powerful) than non—parametric methods. However, parametric
methods rely on stricter assumptions: often, measurement errors
must have Gaussian distributions, and the methods are sensible to
outliers. Non—parametric methods sacrifice some degree of power in
order to gain robustness against outliers, and they make fewer as—
sumptions about measurement errors (Hettmansperger and
McKean, 2011).

Often, transcriptome— or metabolome—wide circadian rhythm
studies compare two groups, which leads to the subject matter of the
present article. One example is comparison of wild type animals to
mutant animals with various deletions of core clock transcription
factor genes (Hughes et 61]., 2012; Kornmann et 61]., 2007; Masri
et 61]., 2014; McCarthy et 61]., 2007). Such studies may allow isolat—
ing the contributions to the circadian transcriptome from various
sources. Another example is comparative studies of animals sub—
jected to various nutritional challenges (Adamovich et 61]., 2014;
Eckel—Mahan et 61]., 2013; Vollmers et 61]., 2009). These studies all
have a certain analytical task in common: to detect changes in rhyth—
micity in many metabolites or transcripts. Here, we will refer to this
task as the differential rhythmicity problem.

To detect e.g. differentially rhythmic transcripts, researchers
have the typically isolated rhythmic transcripts in both groups, using
P value or FDR cutoffs against the null hypothesis of no rhythmicity
in each group. Transcripts with P values falling under the cutoff in
one group and over the cutoff in the other group are then considered
differentially rhythmic (Hughes et al., 2012; Masri et 61]., 2014). In
principle, the two cutoffs may also be chosen differently for each
group, in order for the procedure to be more conservative. For ex—
ample, in order to detect transcripts whose rhythms have been lost
in mutant animals, one may require a P value smaller than 0.001 for
wild type animals, and a P value greater than 0.3 in mutant animals.
Additional criteria might be employed too, such as fold changes be—
tween peaks and troughs. Another approach to the differential
rhythmicity problem was taken by investigators researching core

clock transcripts in two different rat strains (Miyazaki et 61]., 2011).
Amplitudes were estimated with 95% confidence intervals for each
transcript and strain using a non—parametric method (Hughes et 61].,
2010; Miyazaki et al., 2011). Transcripts for which the confidence
intervals did not overlap were classified as differentially rhythmic.
Unfortunately, FDRs or P values for these approaches against rea—
sonable null hypotheses (i.e. no change in rhythmicity between the
groups) have not been presented or computed routinely, since a
comprehensive framework for this task has been lacking in the field.
Changes of phase (peak time) may also be of interest, as was the
case for a study on the effects of high fat diet on the circadian tran-
scriptome and metabolome (Eckel—Mahan et 61]., 2013), although a
rigorous method to estimate and assign P values to phase shifts is
lacking.

Here, we report a unified framework for the estimation and de—
tection of changes in rhythmicity, both amplitudes and phases. We
present both parametric methods for the task, as well as rank based
methods that are robust to outliers and non—Gaussian variations and
measurement error. These methods were implemented as an accom—
panying R package called DODR. The procedures were thoroughly
benchmarked, and compared to P value cutoff methods. We also re—
port an application of DODR to mRNA expression profiles of livers
of mice kept in 12 h light/ 12 h dark conditions, and in constant dark—
ness, respectively. By doing this, we were able to quantify the light—
governed circadian transcriptome, and to implicate the transcription
factor IRF7 in relaying light cues to the liver.

2 Methods

2.1 Simulated time series
Time series were generated by estimates based on mouse liver
mRNA expression data (Supplementary methods and Fig. S1).

2.2 HANOVA
Summed squared e residuals (SS) for the null hypothesis (SS0), and
for the alternative hypothesis (SS1), respectively (Equation 2), are
combined to an F statistic:

(550 — 551V 2

NF n_.
SS1/(n—5) 2: 5

Here, the number 5 is the number of parameters for the alterna—
tive model, and the number 2 is the difference between the param—
eter numbers of the alternative and the null hypotheses.

2.3 Robust differential rhythmicity

The problem formulation (Equation 2) remains the same for this
case, but rather than SS, a rank—based dispersion measure D is mini-
mized in order to yield a fit of the models to data:

1 1 n n+1
Meg) = VEWF 1  (R099) _T>egi-

Here, R denotes the rank. Let D0 and D1 be the dispersions ob—
tained for fitting the null hypothesis and the alternative hypothesis

 

models as above. Then,

where ’f is an estimation of the scale parameter defined as
‘E =  f2(t)dt)_1. Here, f(t) is the probability density function

empirical distribution function of the error terms (Koul et 61]., 1987).

Differential rhythmicity

 

The R package Rfit (Kloke and McKean, 2014) was leveraged to
adapt these robust methods to differential rhythmicity analysis.

2.4 Scale tests

For the standard non—robust linear least squares approach, summed
squared residuals for the separate model fits to the two groups (i.e.
the HANOVA alternative hypothesis model) may be combined and
obey an F distribution when errors are independently identically dis—
tributed with a Gaussian distribution:

f: 611'2/(7’11 — 3)
i=1

n,— N Fn1—3,n2—3-
Zeal/(712 — 3)
i=1

As a robust alternative, we used the Fligner—Killeen test, which is
a nonparametric test for difference in scale between the residuals of
the two groups. Formally, if residuals of group 1 have the distribu—
tion function F(x), then the residuals of group 2 are assumed to have
distribution function F((y — A)/17), and the test is against the null hy—
pothesis that 17 = 1. We leveraged the R package npsm (Kloke and
McKean, 2014) to adapt the Fligner—Killeen test to the differential
rhythmicity problem.

2.5 mRNA expression data for differential expression
analysis

Mouse liver mRNA expression data for LD and DD conditions were
gathered and processed as described in the Supplementary methods
section.

2.6 mRNA differential rhythmicity analysis

In order to avoid counting the same sequencing reads, probe sets
and transcription start sites (TSSs, below) more than once, a subset
of 14 253 non-overlapping RefSeq transcripts were used for the ana—
lysis, where the shortest transcript associated with a given TSS was
retained. 7171 transcripts with a MAS5 present call for at least half
of the time points in both datasets (Hughes et 61]., 2009; Jouffe et 61].,
2013) were considered to be expressed and were used for further
analysis. For the study performed under constant darkness (dark—
dark, DD) conditions (Hughes et 61]., 2009), only every second time
point was used (starting with the first sample at CT 18) in order to
match the sampling resolution of the study performed under light—
dark (LD) conditions (Jouffe et 61]., 2013). For the validation data,
transcripts with Affymetrix expression level >64 in the DD dataset
(Zhang et 61]., 2014) were considered further. P values for circadian
rhythms were computed using the R package RAIN (Thaben and
Westermark, 2014). For the main LD/DD datasets (Hughes et 61].,
2009; Jouffe et 61]., 2013), a meta—analysis of P values was per—
formed using the minP method (Wang et 61]., 2012), in order to com—
bine the P values of the two studies: the resulting combined P values
represents for transcript the alternative hypothesis that at least one
of the DD or LD time series exhibits oscillations. These P values
were Benjamini—Hochberg adjusted for multiple testing. Amplitudes
and phases were estimated using the R package Harmonic
Regression (Luck et 61]., 2014). The robust DODR method was used
on the first LD/DD dataset pair (Hughes et 61]., 2009; Jouffe et 61].,
2013). An adjusted P value cutoff of 0.05 and relative amplitude
threshold of 0.15 (Luck and Westermark, 2016) was used to isolate
transcripts exhibiting a biologically significant circadian rhythm in
at least one of the LD or DD conditions. These transcripts were con—
sidered for further differential rhythmicity analysis: for this, their

robust DODR P values were Benjamini—Hochberg adjusted. Phase
differences between LD and DD conditions are only meaningful
when there are well—defined rhythms in both conditions. Therefore,
a subset of 69 differentially rhythmic transcripts with relative ampli-
tudes >0.15 in both conditions were used for phase comparisons.
These were classified as having pure phase shifts if the absolute log2
fold amplitude change was smaller than 0.1. Amplitude gains were
declared for differentially rhythmic transcripts with log2 fold ampli-
tude change >0.5, amplitude differences were declared for differen-
tially rhythmic transcripts with log2 fold amplitude change either
>0.5 or < —0.5. For comparisons with the validation dataset, a
meta—analysis of the two LD datasets (Jouffe et 61]., 2013; Menet
et 61]., 2012) with the maxP method (Wang et 61]., 2012) was per—
formed using the RAIN P values. Resulting P values represent the al—
ternative hypothesis that both LD time series exhibit oscillations,
these P values were Benjamini—Hochberg adjusted and a P value cut—
off of 0.05 defined transcripts with circadian rhythms in both LD
datasets. As before, phase comparisons were made only for transcripts
exhibiting relative amplitudes >0.15 in both conditions examined.

2.7 GO analysis

The DAVID resource (Huang et 61]., 2009) was used to compute en—
riched GO biological process terms for differentially rhythmic tran-
scripts compared to circadian transcripts; the resulting functional
annotation chart is supplied as Supplementary Table S1.

2.8 TF binding sites predictions
SwissRegulon (Pachkov et 61]., 2007) TF binding site predictions
were considered for promoter regions i300 bp of RefSeq TSSs.

3 Results

3.1 The limits of the threshold based method

To set the stage, we considered the simple P value threshold (PVT)
method used previously in the circadian rhythms field (Hughes
et 61]., 2012; Masri et 61]., 2014). The setting involves time resolved
measurements of two groups, e.g. mRNA expression levels in wild
type and mutant animals, respectively. The PVT method then entails
calling differential rhythmicity when the P value for a rhythmicity
detection test falls under a threshold for one group and above a
threshold for the other group (loss of rhythmicity) or vice versa
(gain of rhythmicity). We aimed primarily to quantify the FDRs of
PVT approaches, which to the best of our knowledge has not previ—
ously been done.

To do this, we estimated circadian amplitudes and random vari—
ability of mouse liver mRNA expression, using a published dataset
(Hughes et 61]., 2012; Section 2). The amplitude measure used in the
present work is relative amplitude: amplitude in absolute units div—
ided by mean. Then, we simulated millions of time series drawing
from the estimated amplitude distribution, and obtained P values
for each time series using harmonic regression (Section 2).
Simulations were performed for experimental settings with 6, 12, 16
and 24 time points sampled over two oscillation periods with con—
stant sampling interval, designs common in the circadian rhythms
field. We then asked two questions regarding FDRs. First (Q1):
what fraction of the simulated time series with a true amplitude
above a given amplitude threshold yielded P values below a given P
value threshold? Second (Q2): what fraction of the simulated time
series with a true amplitude below a given amplitude threshold
yielded P values above a given P value threshold? Both these ques—
tions are necessary for the PVT method: the task is to detect time

series that oscillate in one group (Q1) and to not oscillate in the se—
cond group (Q2): for both these questions, the FDRs need to be con—
trolled. The amplitude cutoff might be set collectively to e.g. 0 or
0.1. It might also be different for the two groups, but then the ampli—
tude cutoff used to detect rhythmic time series should be larger than
the cutoff used to detect non—rhythmic time series. If not, results are
ambiguous: for instance, a feature might be classified as rhythmic
with amplitude greater than 0.05 in group 1, and non-rhythmic with
amplitude less than 0.15 in group 2, both with P < 0.001. We note
at this point that the FDRs obtained for groups 1 and 2 should be
combined to yield a final P value for differential rhythmicity. Such a
combination could amount to simply retaining the largest of the P
values, which is a so—called intersection—union procedure (Berger
and Hsu, 1996).

The results of this computational experiment showed that as the
amplitude cutoff grows larger, the FDRs for Q1 deteriorate quite
substantially. For example in the situation with 16 samples, using a
cutoff P < 10—5 resulted in an FDR of ~0.01 for the amplitude
threshold 0.1 (Fig. 1, blue dotted curve). The correct interpretation
of these numbers is that 7% of the time series with P < 10—5 have an
amplitude that is less than 0.1. Such an FDR for a single feature is
obviously far too high for genome scale experiments because of the
multiple testing correction needed for such settings, which often en—
tails a factor increase of P values of 100—1000. For an amplitude
cutoff of 0 (blue solid curve), the Q1 FDR and P value cutoff are
identical by definition, and the P < 10—5 cutoff may be reasonable
for genome wide studies. For an amplitude cutoff of 0.2 on the other
hand, the P value cutoff has to be on the order of 10—10 to achieve
an FDR of ~0.0001. Here, one should note that the amplitude per—
tains to the signal only: the noise contains (typically) components of
myriad periods including a comparatively insignificant 24 h
component.

However, a disturbing result was that the inverse problem Q2,
that of detecting non—rhythmic time series, is not feasible for small
amplitude cutoffs. This is due to the fact that 85% of the amplitudes
estimated from the mouse liver dataset were larger than 0, (although
most of them very small), raising the P value cutoff to almost 1 for
Q2 still results in a large FDR because of spillover from the large

FDR

Fig. 1. Specificity and power of the cutoff based method. FDR (X axis) should
here be interpreted as a Pvalue for the probability that using a particular har-
monic regression Pvalue cutoff (y axis) results in: (blue curves) a misclassifi-
cation of a time series with an actual amplitude smaller than a given value as
specified in the legend as having a bigger amplitude (BA) than the value, or
(red curves) a misclassification of a rhythmic time series with an actual ampli-
tude bigger than a given value as having a lower amplitude (LA) than the
value. Two guidelines (grey) at P: 0.3 and 10’5 may aid the eye to get a quick
quantitative overview

population with amplitudes just slightly larger than 0. This suggests
that a substantial amplitude cutoff is necessary for PVT methods in
general. In fact, to achieve FDRs of around 0.0001 for Q2 with 16
samples, the amplitude cutoff needs to be set to 0.2 and a threshold
P > 0.1 (Fig. 1, red dashed—dotted curve). In general, the blue curves
in Figure 1 get more useful as they are pushed to the upper right,
while the red curves get more useful as they are pushed to the lower
right. Hence, there is a tradeoff: as the amplitude cutoff increases,
the detection of time series with rhythms below the cutoff becomes
easier, but detection of time series above the cutoff becomes harder.

For other numbers of samples the situation was, naturally, differ—
ent; the same analysis is presented for 6, 12 and 24 samples in
Supplemental Figure S2. In particular, for an experimental design
with only 6 samples, amplitude cutoffs need to be well over 0.1 for
this method to be useful even when investigating only a single
feature.

The main lesson to be learned is that a single P value cutoff gen—
erally works very poorly, in particular due to false positives when
detecting non—rhythmic or sub—amplitude threshold time series. In
practice, the investigator needs to apply much larger P value thresh—
olds for Q2 than for Q1. Furthermore, for experimental settings
with hundreds or thousands of features, the analysis showed that
PVT methods work in practice only if interpreted with amplitude
cutoffs around 0.1—0.2. This is due to the fact that unadjusted P
values typically need to lie below 0.001 since multiple testing correc—
tions have to be performed. When investigating a single feature (e.g.
rhythmic abundance of one protein) the threshold based method
may work, but even then, amplitude cutoffs need to be high if the
number of samples is small. The researcher has to interpret results in
terms of features changing amplitude across a well—defined ampli—
tude threshold, rather than switching between being fundamentally
rhythmic and non-rhythmic, and that simulation studies such as the
one presented here need to be performed.

3.2 Differential rhythmicity: general methods

The initial analysis of PVT methods shows three serious shortcom—
ings of such approaches. First, PVT methods must rely upon simula—
tions to yield rigorous P values, which is costly and require
estimations of amplitude distributions from prior data. Second, the
PVT approach puts a serious cap on the detection power for experi—
mental designs with 12 or fewer samples. Third, the approach de—
tects only amplitude changes over a pre—defined amplitude
threshold. Neither arbitrary amplitude changes, such as an ampli—
tude decrease from very high to moderate, nor phase changes are de—
tected. Thus, we investigated alternatives.

We started with a simple description of rhythms in terms of their
fundamental harmonic (first Fourier coefficient). We divide each
time series with its mean value to obtain scaled measurements. If gig,-
is the scaled measurement at time point t,, we have

yg, : 1 —l— agcos(cot,-) —l— bgsin(cot,-) —l— eg,, (1)
where eg, is the differences between this model and scaled measured
readouts, and g symbolizes possible subdivision in groups. This is

equivalent to yg, : 1 —l— Agcos (cot,- — gag) , so that the relative ampli—

tude is Ag : 1 mg, —l— bi, and the phase satisfies tan<g0g> : bg/ag. We

have two groups (indexed 1 and 2) that we want to compare, with a
total of n=n1+n2 samples. The basic alternative is that we let
Equation 1 describe both groups, i.e. assume no difference between
the parameters ag and bg for the different groups and thus no differen-
tial rhythmicity. This is the null hypothesis H0. Values 3) are fitted

using the standard linear least squares procedure: harmonic regression
(Cornelissen, 2014). We set up an alternative (H 1) to describe the situ—
ation where there is a change in the rhythmicity between the groups
and also fit this extended model to the 3) values. This translates into:

with x = [cos(cot) Sin(0)t)l and ﬁg 2 i1;

1 with t as a column vec—

tor of all time points. The alternative hypothesis may describe both
a change in amplitude and in phase, quantified by ﬁg. Estimated
phases and amplitudes using the least squares method may be repre—
sented as sticks in a plane, where the length of the stick represents
the amplitude and the direction represents the phase. The procedure
also yields standard error estimates for a and b represented by a con—
fidence ellipse, and amplitude, phase, and confidence ellipses may
thus be represented as balls on sticks (‘lolliplots’, Fig. 2). The differ-
ences between the groups is then quantified by the distance between
the two lolliplots for the separate fits (Fig. 2). We use an ANOVA
procedure to test the whether the quality of fit gained by fitting two
rhythmic models (H1), as compared to just one (H0), is statistically
significant (Fig. 2 and Section 2). The quality of fit is in this case
quantified as the sum of the squared differences eg,, which are
assumed to be independent and identically (for both groups g) dis—
tributed with (approximately) a Gaussian distribution. This particu—
lar ANOVA procedure is sometimes termed Chow test.

Finally, we noted that even if rhythms do not change, biological
noise levels may differ between groups. In this way, rhythms may be
more buried in random variability in one group than in the other:
the signal to noise ratios might differ. From a biological viewpoint,
this effect may in some settings be functionally equivalent to differ—
ential rhythmicity. Equations 1 allow a straightforward testing pro—
cedure also for this problem: whether the variance of 61 equals that
of 62. For the null hypothesis of equal variances, a scale test of the
ratio of the sum—squared residuals of group 1 and 2 will follow an F
distribution (Section 2) and thus addresses this problem. In practice,
researchers may want to combine the differential rhythmicity
ANOVA test and the scale test.

With this, we had a general procedure for quantifying differen-
tial rhythmicity and assigning a P value to the measured rhythmicity

difference, as well as a general test for differential signal to noise
ratios. We implemented these harmonic ANOVA (hereafter:
HANOVA) procedures as an R package named DODR (for
Detection Of Differential Rhythmicity), and aimed to assess its per—
formance in settings typical for transcriptome—wide circadian
rhythm studies.

To gauge the specificity and power of the DODR HANOVA
procedure, we first designed artificial experiments with 500 000
simulated pairs of time series. In one class of experiment, we tested
detection of phase shifts. Simulated time series consisted of a mean
value of 1, a rhythmic component with a period of 24 h, a relative
amplitude 0.2, and an added Gaussian random noise term with
standard deviation 0.1. These values are typical of mRNA expres-
sion levels detected in tissue samples (Thaben and Westermark,
2014)). We generated 12, 16, or 24 samples over two periods (48 h).
Phase difference between the two time series in each pair were either
0 (true negatives) or 4.5 h (true positives, reflecting biologically rele-
vant phase shifts that are non—trivial to detect). The HANOVA pro—
cedure was applied to each pair, yielding P values for the null
hypothesis of no difference in rhythms (0 h phase difference).

In practice, only pairs with low P values would be retained as
candidate hits likely to have a real phase difference. For each P value
cutoff (ideally equal to the false positive rate, FPR), we computed
the FPR (fraction of true negatives misclassified as positives) and the
recall (fraction of true positives correctly classified). A graph of the
recall against FPR is called a ROC (receiver operator characteristic)
curve, and should be oriented close to the upper left corner (i.e.
recall >> FPR, with the area under the curve (AUC) approaching 1) if
the P values of the HANOVA methods are meaningful. This was in-
deed the case (Fig. 3a, black solid curve); the 4.5 h phase shift was
detected with high accuracy (AUC : 0.9995 ).

We investigated a pure amplitude shift with simulated time series
with parameters as above, forming pairs with no phase shift but
with either the same amplitude, or with amplitudes of 0.2 and 0.1,
respectively. Although this is a significant two—fold amplitude
change, the lolliplots show that the detection of amplitude changes
in general are harder than phase changes: the balls on the sticks tend
to be closer. Indeed, while still acceptable, the ROC curve for this
task reflected the general greater difficulty of detecting amplitude
changes (Fig. 3a, black dashed curve, AUC : 0.8807).

Finally, the scale test was benchmarked for the case of a noise in—
crease of from 0.1 to 0.2 at constant amplitude 0.2. The ROC curve
for this scale test setting showed a power lying between those of the
phase shift and amplitude change situations (Supplemental Fig. 83A,
AUC : 0.9699).

3.3 Methods robust to outliers
Although the HANOVA and scale test procedures seemed promising
for detecting differential rhythmicity, the presence of outliers (meas—
urements that markedly deviate from other measurements) might
present a serious problem. In practice, outliers may be present both
in RNA sequencing data, whose error distributions are often mark—
edly non—Gaussian, and for microarray based measurements, where
array or hybridization quality may ﬂuctuate in complex manners.
When including one outlier in each simulated time series (Section
2), the ROC curves indeed indicated significantly reduced power of
the HANOVA method for the detection of changes in phase, ampli—
tude and noise levels (Fig. 3B and S3B, AUCs now only 0.9533,
0.6867 and 0.8402 for phase, amplitude and noise, respectively).
We therefore next aimed at devising a robust method for the differ—
ential rhythmicity problem, capable of better handling outliers.

Other parameters as for panel C

For the general regression problems, robust rank based methods
have been developed that work quite well when there are outliers in
the data. Therefore, we implemented a robust rank based method
for the differential rhythmicity problem. For this, we stayed with the
general formulation (Equation 1), but switched to rank—based meth—
ods for quantifying and comparing the qualities of the different fits
(Hettmansperger and McKean, 2011; Section 2). This was done

both for the amplitude and phase change problem, as well as for the
scale (noise change) problem. The main difference to the HANOVA
procedures is that instead of sum of squared differences egi, a score
function that includes the ranks of the egi values is used instead. As
before, egi are assumed to be independent and identically distrib—
uted, but here not necessarily with a Gaussian distribution, which
endows the method with robustness to outliers.

Applying this robust method indeed resulted in marked improve—
ments of the ROC curves for the cases with outliers (Fig. 3B and
S3B red curves, AUCs 0.9972, 0.8389 and 0.9411 for phase, ampli-
tude and noise, respectively). As is the hallmark of sound robust
methods, there were only very marginal losses of power when com—
paring the robust method to HANOVA for the cases without out—
liers (Fig. 3B, red curves, AUCs 0.9991, 0.8681 and 0.9549 for
phase, amplitude and noise, respectively). We thus concluded that
the robust DODR method is a promising method for application to
biological data.

We proceeded to more systematically investigate the power of
the robust DODR method for detecting various phase shifts and
amplitude differences in typical experimental settings. Researchers
are often interested in how large the recall is for a given FDR. For in-
stance, a recall of 0.5 at an FDR of 0.1 means that 50% of the true
positives are captured, when using a P value cutoff that results in at
most 10% of the hits being false discoveries (the P value cutoff is
usually determined by using Benjamini Hochberg—adjusted P values).
We investigated the recall for various FDRs, various prevalences
(fraction of true positives among the simulated time series pairs) and
various numbers of samples often taken in genome—wide experi-
ments for investigating circadian rhythms: 12, 16 and 24 time
points, respectively. We first fixed the FDR to 0.1 and the preva—
lence to 0.05 (i.e. 5% of the pairs had true differences in rhythmi-
city), and included outliers in the simulated time series. Phase
difference were varied between 0 and 12h, while the amplitude
change was varied between —3 and 3 log2 fold changes, with a refer-
ence amplitude of 0.2 as above.

We found that a 4—fold (2 log2 fold) amplitude change, i.e. be—
tween 0.2 and 0.8, is readily detectable with a recall of nearly 1
(Fig. 3C). However, for the 2—fold amplitude change between 0.2
and 0.4, the recall had sunk to only around 0.5 if the number of
samples was 12. For 16 samples, the recall was still around 80%,
and for 24 samples, the recall was around 95%. The recall then rap—
idly sank as the amplitudes became more similar. The situation was
not symmetric: detecting amplitude losses from relative amplitudes
of 0.2 to lower amplitudes was harder (Fig. 3C). This is because the
signal—to—noise ratio was approached (the noise level was constantly
at 0.1). Phase change detection was nearly perfect for all numbers of
samples for phase differences >8 h, at which point the detection
power started to deteriorate for the 12 samples case (Fig. 3C). This
point of deterioration decreased with N2 h for each of the 16 and 24
samples cases, so that phase shifts of N4 h still are almost perfectly
detected for the 24 samples case. Phase shifts < 2 h were in all cases
very hard to detect. Phase shift detection became easier for higher
amplitudes than the default 0.2, with phase shifts >2 h almost per—
fectly detected for 16 samples per group when the amplitude was
0.8 (Supplementary Fig. 83C). The prevalence and FDR did not
have as dramatic effects as the number of samples, although natur—
ally, higher FDRs and prevalences increased detection power
(Supplementary Fig. S3D—G).

These results provide useful practical guidelines about what to
expect in terms of detection power and false discoveries for various
numbers of samples, which should aid future experimental planning.
In particular, we note that for 12 samples per group, the recall is

91% ‘09 1sn8nv uo sejeﬁuv s01 ‘121u10111123 aIo AllSJQATUn 112 /§.IO'S[BU.IHO[p.IOJXO'SOTlBIIIJOJUTOTQ/ﬁdllq 11101; pep1201umoq

Differential rhythmicity

 

already limited and we thus would not recommend fewer samples
for differential rhythmicity analysis.

3.4 Application: the light—induced circadian
transcriptome

In order to demonstrate the usefulness of differential rhythmicity
analysis to gain biological insight, we applied the method to mRNA
expression data collected from mouse liver to address a specific bio—
logical question.

In mammals, circadian rhythms in mRNA expression of cells in
tissues depend on the cellular clocks in the tissue, as well as on circa—
dian systemic cues. Such systemic cues, which may be humoral or
neuronal, are orchestrated by the suprachiasmatic nuclei (SCN) in
the hypothalamus. The SCN become synchronized to external light-
dark cycles via innervation from the retinohypothalamic tract
(Dibner et 61]., 2010). For a metabolic organ such as the liver, there
are also rhythmic cues that are not directly emanating from the
SCN, such as feeding—related cues (Menaker et 61]., 2013). In add—
ition, there appears to be pathways that relay cues from external
light—dark cycles directly to peripheral organs such as the liver, with—
out involving the circadian clock in the SCN (Husse et 61]., 2015 ).

There are two standard protocols when performing assays on
peripheral tissues of mice: Either animals are kept in 12 h—12 h am-
bient light-dark (LD) cycles, or they are kept in constant darkness
(DD) (Dunlap et 61]., 2004). Animals are then harvested at different
time points (time is measured Zeitgeber time, ZT, for LD, or circa-
dian time, CT, for DD). The DD protocol grants a greater certitude
that measured rhythms originate from the endogenous circadian
clock, rather than from direct light cues: strictly, rhythms in LD are
sometimes referred to as diurnal rather than circadian in order to re-
ﬂect this (here, however, we use the term circadian throughout). On
the other hand, the LD protocol may be closer to natural conditions.

Especially with regard to circadian mRNA expression, liver is par-
ticularly well studied, exhibiting thousands of transcripts whose abun—
dances cycle in a circadian manner (Zhang et 61]., 2014). There are
differences in circadian rhythms in mouse liver mRNA expression lev-
els as measured under DD and LD conditions, respectively (Korencic
et 61]., 2014). However, to the best of our knowledge, these differences
have not been quantified on a transcriptome—wide scale.

Thus, we asked whether there are widespread differences in the
mouse liver circadian transcriptome between animals kept under
DD and LD conditions. To investigate this, we collected microarray—
based transcriptome data from two different studies, one in which
mice were held in DD (Hughes et 61]., 2009) and one where mice
were held in LD (Jouffe et 61]., 2013). In both cases, C5 7BL/6J mice
were studied, and the same microarray platform was employed.

Out of 7171 expressed transcripts, we obtained 1580 transcripts
that were cycling in either condition (see Section 2 for criteria).
Using DODR with a FDR of 0.1, we found that 262 of these tran—
scripts exhibit differential rhythmicity. Of these, only 10 were pure
phase shifts (see Section 2 for criteria and Figure S4 for time series
plots of these transcripts). There was a broad tendency for increased
amplitudes in the LD compared to DD mice, 183 transcripts ex—
hibited amplitude gains (Fig. 4A and Supplementary Fig. S5). These
transcripts tended to have late phases with a median phase at ZT
17.2 (Fig. 4B). This late phase distribution was significantly different
from the rest of the LD circadian transcriptome (P < 0.001,
Watson’s two—sample test, Supplementary Fig. 86A). Furthermore, a
gene ontology (GO) analysis of these transcripts strongly suggested
that they are involved in immune response functions
(Supplementary Table S1 and Section 2).

transcripts that were already determined to be differentially rhythmic with an
LD amplitude gain in the original data. Only transcripts with amplitudes larger
than 0.15 in both LD datasets were used, to obtain clean phase estimations

Which mechanisms might underlie these amplitude gains?
Transcription factors (TF) with circadian patterns of abundance are
an important factor behind circadian rhythms in mRNA expression.
Overrepresentation patterns of binding sites for TFs in promoters of
genes expressed in a circadian fashion can provide clues to TFs and
mechanisms behind circadian regulation of transcription (Luck and
Westermark, 2016). In order to isolate candidate TFs involved in the
differentially rhythmic LD transcriptome, we searched for TF binding
sites enriched in the promoter regions within 300 bp of the transcrip—
tion start sites of the differentially rhythmic transcripts (Section 2).
Enrichment was computed against the background of all circadian
transcripts. The top candidate binding site was for IRF1, 2 and 7,
with adjusted P value <10_5 (two—sided Fisher’s exact test for enrich-
ment). Notably, the Irf7 transcript was itself differentially rhythmic,
with a strong circadian rhythm in the LD mice and a ﬂat expression
profile in the DD mice (Fig. 4C). Also, the phase of the Irf7 transcript
was in the evening, at ZT 18.4, just as differentially rhythmic tran-
scripts with amplitude gain in general. A transcript list with the results
of this analysis is provided in Supplementary Table S2.

Thus, IRF7 emerged as a candidate TF for involvement in circa—
dian transcriptional regulation limited to the LD condition. This is
consistent with the strong enrichment of functions related to the im—
mune system among the transcripts with stronger rhythmicity in the
LD condition, as revealed by the GO analysis. To validate the find—
ings, we turned to two other mouse liver datasets (hereafter: valid—
ation data). These were microarray—based data for the DD
conditions with 24 samples taken every 2 h (Zhang et 61]., 2014), and
RNA sequencing data for the LD condition with 12 samples taken
every 4 h (Menet et 61]., 2012). Because of the differences in technol—
ogy with different dynamic ranges, rhythms should here not be com—
pared directly using DODR: spurious amplitude differences due to
technology would bias the analysis. However, we may start with the
transcripts identified as differentially rhythmic in the previous ana—
lysis, and ask whether the tendencies for amplitudes and phases are
the same in the validation data.

The time resolution of the validation data is poorer, but 88 of
the 183 transcripts previously found to have amplitude gains had

circadian rhythms in both LD datasets (see Section 2 for criteria).
The vast majority of these exhibited amplitude gains in LD com-
pared to DD also in the validation dataset (Fig. 4D and S7). For the
transcripts found to be rhythmic in the validation dataset, but not
found to be differentially rhythmic in the original dataset, amplitude
gains were much more moderate (Fig. 4E, P < 10_15, rank sum test),
so that technical artifacts may be excluded. Thus, amplitude gains
under LD compared to DD conditions were widespread and highly
reproducible. The transcripts exhibiting pure phase shift in the ori-
ginal dataset exhibited very similar phase shifts in the validation
dataset, which underscored the reproducibility (Supplementary Fig.
S8). However, phases of transcripts with increased amplitude in the
original analysis tended to have early to mid—day rather than late
phases in the validation mice (Supplementary Fig. S6B). This dis—
crepancy was visible in a phase comparison between the two LD
datasets of transcripts with amplitude gains in LD (Fig. 4F).
However, the discrepancy was absent among cycling transcripts
without amplitude gains (Supplementary Fig. S6C). Thus, there
seems to be a group of transcripts that cycle more strongly in LD,
but whose phase might be rather plastic.

Since the transcripts with plastic phase had evening phases in the
original dataset, IRF7 could be involved in the transcriptional regu—
lation of these plastic transcripts. Indeed, the Irf7 transcript was
rhythmic in the validation LD but not DD mice, exhibiting a morn-
ing rather than an evening phase (Supplementary Fig. S6D). The pu—
tative IRF7—regulated transcripts (i.e. with predicted binding site(s)
in the promoters) also exhibited larger amplitude gains than other
circadian transcripts in the validation data (P=0.0023, rank sum
test). Thus, IRF7 binding sites were predictive of larger amplitude in
LD as compared to DD also in the validation dataset. Furthermore,
transcripts with promoters having IRF7 binding sites clearly tended
to have plastic phases, with many transcripts exhibiting evening
phases in the original dataset and morning phases in the validation
data (Supplementary Fig. S6E).

Among possible explanations for the discrepancy could be differ—
ent feeding conditions: in one of the studies, mice were subjected to
restricted feeding during night, to reduce confounding inﬂuence
from feeding—induced cues (Jouffe et al., 2013). Another explanation
could be differing lighting strengths in the mouse facilities. This ex—
planation would imply a strong phase sensitivity of LD—specific
rhythms in mRNA expression to lighting strength.

4 Discussion

We presented general methods for detecting changes in rhythm,
both in amplitude and phase. This works for a variety of types of
paired measurements, such as pairs of single or thousands of time
series measured under two different conditions. We showed that
generally, at least ~12 samples in each group are needed, and also
quantified the improvements that can be expected for larger number
of samples. The methods were implemented as the freely available R
package DODR, appearing on the R package repository CRAN to—
gether with the present paper.

When the main interests of an investigation are pure amplitude
gains or losses, the threshold based method might be used, and the
performance measures that we computed (Fig. 1) may be used as
guideline. However, a more robust strategy is probably to use
DODR, and to infer the nature of the changes post 1906, by ampli—
tude and phase estimates (also provided by the DODR program).

We applied differential rhythmicity analysis to quantify differ-
ences in the circadian transcriptomes in livers of mice held in DD or

LD cycles, respectively. This analysis showed that the primary dif-
ference between the LD and DD is an amplitude boost for a few
hundred transcripts in the LD condition. This effect was robustly re—
producible, as shown by analysis of an independent validation data—
set. Further, the analysis suggested that IRF7 is a putative factor
involved in generating circadian rhythms in transcription under LD
conditions. The Irf7 transcript was shown previously to exhibit a
circadian rhythm in mouse retina, even in mice with a mutation that
disrupts the core cellular circadian clock (Storch et al., 2007), sup—
porting a role for light cues directly driving rhythms in the abun-
dance of this transcript. Possibly, the immune system is involved in
relaying light-induced rhythmic cues to Irf7 transcription, since
transcription of this gene is regulated by the JAK—STAT pathway
(Ning et al., 2005). Although the set of transcripts that gained rhyth—
micity in LD was reproducible and seen in the validation dataset as
well, curiously these transcripts tended to have different phases in
the two different LD experiments considered. We can only speculate
about the reasons for this, which may include laboratory conditions.
In any case, this phase plasticity is a notable phenomenon and prob—
ably a general feature of the circadian program (van der Vinne et al.,
2015

Several research paths might be followed to develop differential
rhythmicity analysis further. The present methods does not address
possible period changes. In principle, such an analysis would not
present serious difficulties, other than that nonlinear fitting methods
would have to be employed. Standard likelihood ratio tests for prob—
lem formulations similar to Equation 1 could then be performed.
More challenging future developments could be development of
methods for detecting changes in wave form or underlying trends or
oscillation envelopes.

In summary, the methods presented here will be useful for re—
search on biological rhythms such as circadian rhythms when differ-
ent conditions are investigated. There are several examples:
circadian rhythms are often studied in various mutants or in other
conditions such as aging organisms (Chen et al., 2016; Eckel-Mahan
et al., 2013; Sancar et al., 2011; Wijnen et al., 2006). Rigorous dif—
ferential rhythmicity analysis could routinely be employed to assess
alterations or loss of rhythmicity.

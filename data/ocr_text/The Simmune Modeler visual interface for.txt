ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biochemical modeling efforts now frequently take advan-
tage of the possibility to automatically create reaction networks based
on the specification of painNise molecular interactions. Even though a
variety of tools exist to visualize the resulting networks, defining the
rules for the molecular interactions typically requires writing scripts,
which impacts the non-specialist accessibility of those approaches.
We introduce the Simmune Modeler that allows users to specify mo-
lecular complexes and their interactions as well as the reaction-
induced modifications of the molecules through a flexible visual inter-
face. It can take into account the positions of the components of trans-
membrane complexes relative to the embedding membranes as well
as symmetry aspects affecting the reactions of multimeric molecular
structures. Models created with this tool can be simulated using the
Simmune Simulator or be exported as SBML code or as files describ-
ing the reaction networks as systems of ODEs for import into Matlab.
Availability: The Simmune Modeler and the associated simulators as
well as extensive additional documentation and tutorials are freely
available for Linux, Mac and Windows: http://go.usa.gov/QeH (Note
shortened case-sensitive URLl).

1 INTRODUCTION

Many cellular biochemical signaling processes involve inter-
actions among molecules with multiple binding sites and various
biochemical states (such as the phosphorylation states or struc-
tural conformations of molecular domains). For example, scaf-
fold proteins with multiple potential binding partners can give
rise to very large reaction networks owing to the combinatorial
possibilities of multi-molecular complexes containing those pro-
teins (Hlavacek et al., 2003). Conventional modeling approaches
rely on creating computational representations of such reaction
networks manually, by explicitly listing all multi-molecular com-
plexes and all reactions they can participate in (see Supplemen-
tary Text 1 for a comparison of Simmune with other
approaches). This can be tedious or impossible, depending on
the complexity of the network. To address this problem, a variety
of approaches has been developed that can automatically

determine all reactions and the resulting complexes based on
the user-speciﬁed pairwise interactions among molecular binding
sites (Feret et al., 2009; Hlavacek et al., 2006; Lok and Brent,
2005; Meier-Schellersheim et al., 2006). Although several tools
permit users to simulate or analyze such ‘rule-based’ networks
and models (Colvin et al., 2010; Sneddon et al., 2011; Xu et al.,
2011), creating them typically requires writing scripts, which may
render the model deﬁnition process non-intuitive for researchers
with an experimental biological background. A Visual interface
capturing all relevant aspects of molecular interaction rules using
iconographic symbols can considerably lower the threshold for
non-theorists to start working with computational models.
Moreover, it can offer important advantages over script-based
approaches in particular when aspects such as the position of
molecular components relative to membranes or symmetry prop-
erties of multimeric complexes come into play.

2 SIMMUNE MODELER APPLICATION

The Simmune Modeler represents molecules, their states and bind-
ing sites as iconographic symbols that can be manipulated through
basic mouse operations for the specification of molecular inter-
actions or enzymatic transformations (see Fig. l). Molecules can
consist of multiple components that can, for trans-membrane mol-
ecules, be assigned to the inner or outer leaﬂet of membranes that
embed them. This latter feature makes it straightforward to model
the biochemical barrier functionality of cellular membranes in spa-
tially resolved simulations: binding sites on the ‘outside’ of a mem-
brane will interact only with other ‘outside’ binding sites. It also
provides a natural way to implement the transmembrane signaling
behavior of receptors: the ligation of a binding site located on the
‘outside’ part of the receptor can be linked to a state change affect-
ing availability or reaction rates of ‘inside’ binding sites.

To Visualize the specification of states of molecular compo-
nents, the Simmune Modeler uses colored tags that can be
associated with any user-defined molecular property, such as
phosphorylation state or steric accessibility of functional do-
mains. Molecular components can carry any (in principle)
number of such tags being displayed as either ﬁlled, empty or
dotted squares, representing an, oﬂ or don ’t care states, respect-
ively. Similarly, the binding states of molecular binding sites are
Visualized as filled, empty or dotted circles representing bound,
unbound or don ’t care binding sites. This is useful for specifying
reaction rules that depend on particular binding sites being free
or occupied. Using combinations of molecular state tags and
symbols for binding states, the user can specify the exact

Fig. 1. Visual speciﬁcation of molecular interactions with the Simmune

Modeler. G—protein coupled receptors, once activated by their extracellular

ligands, can promote the GDP—GTP exchange by the Goc component of the associated G-protein complexes. Phosphorylation through receptor kinases

tags the receptors for internalization as part of their negative regulation

. Left panel: Interaction between a ligand (white circle) and the binding site

[labeled (3)] of the extracellular domain of the receptor. The association leads to the activation of the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor, as indicated by
the red square tag switching from an empty shape with a dotted outline (encoding ‘any state’ or ‘don’t care’) to a ﬁlled shape (encoding ‘on’). Note that
the engagement of the two binding sites (at receptor and ligand) alters their display mode from empty circles (indicating ‘unbound’) to ﬁlled circles
(indicating ‘bound’). Center panel: The active receptor induces a GDP—GTP exchange at the associated G-proteins. This switch is indicated as the
transformation of the empty green square (‘off’) on the Goc subunit into a ﬁlled green square (‘on’). The full complex diagram shows the state before this
transformation, the partial diagram in the upper right corner the result state. Note that the transformation requires the receptor to be active (ﬁlled red
tag), but does not require the ligand to be still bound (dotted outline of the extracellular binding site). Right panel: Interaction between a receptor kinase

(green circle) and the cytoplasmic domain of the receptor. This interaction

uses a site on the receptor that is different from the site [labeled (2)] recruiting

the G-proteins. However, the interaction rule requires that the G-proteins not be bound to the receptor. This is indicated by the empty circle representing
a free G-protein recruitment binding site (in this ﬁgure emphasized by a red circle around the binding site). The interaction moreover requires the
receptor to be active (red ﬁlled tag) and the blue tag, representing the receptor’s phosphorylation state to be in the off state. After association with
the receptor, the receptor kinase can phosphorylate the receptor (switching the blue tag from empty to full, not shown). The full complex diagram shows
the state before ligation, the partial diagram in the upper right corner the result state. The model is provided as Supplementary Material

conditions under which a certain biochemical reaction can take
place and what the consequences (state modiﬁcations) for the
interacting molecular complexes are.

In most use cases, the mapping from the molecules before a
reaction to the result molecules is uniquely speciﬁed through the
molecule types of the reaction participants. However, for mo-
lecular transformations with multiple instances of a particular
molecule type, e. g the autophosphorylation of a multimeric com-
plex consisting of identical subunits, this mapping cannot be
inferred automatically. To permit a unique deﬁnition of such
reactions, the user of the software can specify the mapping ex-
plicitly (see Supplementary Text 1 for details).

The Simmune Modeler was designed to support models that
include interactions between receptors located on the mebranes of
adjacent cells. Molecules such as the important Cadherin-family
adhesion receptors can form homophilic bonds whose character-
istics depend on whether the molecules are located in the same
membrane (‘cis’ interaction) or in distinct adjacent membranes
(‘trans’ interaction). To take this into account, the Simmune
Modeler permits the speciﬁcation of the binding mode (cis or
trans) for interactions between pairs of membrane-bound mol-
ecules (Supplementary Fig. S2). To facilitate model development,
model properties can be inspected with the help of a ﬂexible query
interface. The models created with the software can be simulated
with the Simmune Toolset (Angermann et al., 2012) and can be
exported as SBML ﬁles or mass-action Ordinary Differential
Equation (ODE) descriptions that can be imported into
MatlabTM or other ODE solver tools (see discussion in
Supplementary Text 2). Moreover, the modeler will support the
emerging SBML 3 standard for encoding multi-component,

multi-state molecular complexes to allow for exchange of
models with other rule-based approaches such as BNGL
(Hlavacek et al., 2006) and Kappa (Feret et al., 2009).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Long expansions of short tandem repeats (STRs), i.e.
DNA repeats of 2—6 nt, are associated with some genetic diseases.
Cost-efficient high-throughput sequencing can quickly produce bil-
lions of short reads that would be useful for uncovering disease-
associated STRs. However, enumerating STR3 in short reads remains
largely unexplored because of the difficulty in elucidating STRs much
longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads.

Results: We propose ab initio procedures for sensing and locating
long STRs promptly by using the frequency distribution of all STRs
and paired-end read information. We validated the reproducibility of
this method using biological replicates and used it to locate an STR
associated with a brain disease (SCA31). Subsequently, we
sequenced this STR site in 11 SCA31 samples using SMRTTM sequen-
cing (Pacific Biosciences), determined 2.3—3.1kb sequences at
nucleotide resolution and revealed that (I'GGAA)- and
(T AAAATAGAA)—repeat expansions determined the instability of the
repeat expansions associated with SCA31. Our method could also
identify common STRs, (AAAG)— and (AAAAG)—repeat expansions,
which are remarkably expanded at four positions in an SCA31
sample. This is the first proposed method for rapidly finding dis-
ease-associated long STR3 in personal genomes using hybrid sequen-
cing of short and long reads.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many genetic disorders are caused by or associated with short
tandem repeats (STRs), repetitive elements of 2—6 nt. Regarding
the mechanism underlying the phenomenon of repeat expansion,
unusual structural features of repeat-containing regions that
affect cellular replication, repair and recombination are thought
to induce frequent replication slippage, thereby expanding

repeats (Mirkin, 2007). STRs have been found in a variety of
genomic regions. Huntington’s disease is associated with expan-
sion of the triplet repeat (CAG)” (polyglutamine runs in proteins)
in the coding region of huntingtin (The Huntington’s Disease
Collaborative Research Group, 1993), where n<28 in normal
samples, 11:28—35 in intermediate cases, 11: 36—40 in reduced
penetrance and n>40 in full penetrance (Walker, 2007). Spinal
and bulbar muscular atrophy is also associated with (CAG) re-
peats in one exon (La Spada et al., 1991).

In addition to exons, STRs have been observed in a variety of
genomic regions such as untranslated regions (UTRs), introns
and promoters. Fragile-X syndrome is associated with (CGG)
repeat in the 5’-UTR (Kremer et al., 1991; Sherman et al.,
1985; Verkerk et al., 1991) and myotonic dystrophy type 1
(DMl) with (CTG) repeat in the 3’-UTR (Brook et al., 1992;
Mahadevan et al., 1992). In introns, spinocerebellar ataxia type
10 (SCAlO) is associated with (ATTCT) repeat (Matsuura et al.,
2000), myotonic dystrophy type 2 (DM2) with (CCTG) repeat
(Liquori et al., 2001), amyotrophic lateral sclerosis/frontotem-
poral dementia (ALS/FTD) with (GGGGCC) repeat (DeJesus-
Hernandez et al., 2011; Orr, 2011; Renton et al., 2011) and
SCA36 with (GGCCTG) repeat (Kobayashi et al., 2011).
Consequently, whole-genome sequencing capable of observing
non-exonic regions is required to characterize STRs peculiar to
a personal genome.

Several expanded repeats in RNA, such as CUG, CCUG,
CAG, CGG, AUUCU and UGGAA, are associated with her-
editary diseases and are known to accumulate in nuclear RNA
foci in which several proteins are sequestrated in the process of
foci formation (for a review see Wojciechowska and Krzyzosiak,
2011). These RNA foci are thought to have a negative effect on
host cells, leading to disorders in cellular pathways
Wojciechowska and Krzyzosiak, 2011).

To search personal genomes for STRs, the most cost-efﬁcient
way would be to resequence an entire personal genome and to
collect billions of short reads of ~100 bp in length using available
high-throughput sequencers. However, the infeasibility of ob-
taining longer reads at reasonable cost might lead to the failure
to detect important STRs because expandable repeats associated
with diseases can sometimes be quite long [e. g. (ATTCT)”,
11: 800—4500 in SCAlO and (CCTG)”, n: ~5000 in DM2] and
are much longer than 100 bp, the typical length of short reads,

making the identiﬁcation and location of long STRs in a per-
sonal genome non-trivial.

Another serious problem is that STRs have several variants
with many mutations. The spontaneous mutation rate of STRs,
3.78 x 10‘4 to 7.44 x 10‘2 in the human Y-chromosome
(Ballantyne et al., 2010), is far higher than the rate of copy
number variation, 1.7 x 10‘6 to 1.2 x 10‘4 (Lupski, 2007), and
the reported average rate of de novo single-nucleotide variation,
1.18 x10—8 (SD=O.15 x10—8) (Conrad et al., 2011) and
1.20 x 10‘8 (Kong at al., 2012). The ultrahigh mutation rate of
STRs is thought to be a major force driving genetic variation
producing a variety of STRs with differences often speciﬁc to
personal genomes. Therefore, detecting various STRs by process-
ing billions of short raw reads is fundamental to the analysis of
personal genomes.

Several software programs list STRs, such as Tandem Repeat
Finder (Benson, 1999), Mreps (Kolpakov et al., 2003),
ATRHunter WVexler et al., 2005), IMEx (Mudunuri and
Nagarajaram, 2007) and T-reks (Jorda and Kajava, 2009) (for
a recent review that compares these programs, see Lim et al.,
2013); however, these conventional programs are designed to
retrieve STRs from nearly complete or draft long genomes and
are not intended for processing billions of short reads in a rea-
sonable amount of time. Another problem involved in handling
short reads is the difﬁculty of determining the accurate positions
of STRs in the genome because reads ﬁlled with STRs are not
included in the genome or often map to multiple locations. The
problem is solvable in some cases when a ﬂanking region around
an STR in a read is long enough to map to a unique position
(Fig. 1B). To resolve these special cases, Gymrek et al. developed
the program lobSTR (Gymrek et al., 2012), which improves the
efﬁciency of this process by selecting ~240 000 candidate regions
harboring STRs in the human genome. Owing to severe restric-
tions in potential STR regions, however, we might overlook
novel STRs hidden in numerous short reads because known
STRs associated with diseases are frequently much longer than
100 bp, the typical length of short reads produced by high-
throughput sequencers (Fig. 1C).

Here, we propose a new cost-efﬁcient method for calculating a
comprehensive collection of STRs that are longer than short
reads by inspecting the frequency distribution of STRs in short
reads. To approximate the locations of such STRs, we use
paired-end sequencing to facilitate locating the opposite end of
the read with the focal STR in a pair, thereby narrowing down
the location of the focal STR. Finally, we present a statistical
procedure for selecting STRs that are signiﬁcantly expanded in
the case sample.

2 METHODS

2.1 Non-redundant representation of STRs

Our goal was to enumerate all possible instances of STRs with 2—6-base-
long repeat units efﬁciently. In general, our algorithm can detect repeat
units of an arbitrary length without sacriﬁcing computational time. We
also present an example of disease-associated STRs with a 10-base repeat
unit in SCA31 (Sato et al., 2009). Care is required to avoid double count-
ing identical STR occurrences characterized by more than one STR pat-
tern. To remove redundancy, the basic unit of an STR should be
minimized; e.g. the repeat unit of ACACACAC is AC rather than

ACAC. Another reduction method is to merge occurrences of the reverse
complement of an STR into the set of the focal STR. Therefore, we call
the repeat unit representative if it is not a repeat of a shorter unit and is
the ﬁrst lexicographical motif when all possible shifts of the motif and its
reverse complement are considered. Supplementary Table S1 presents the
numbers of representative repeat units with typical examples.

2.2 Efﬁcient algorithm for listing approximate STRs in
billions of short reads

STRs are inherently ‘approximate’ in the sense that some unit occurrences
are allowed to contain a small number of mutations (Ballantyne et al.,
2010). Listing approximate STRs, however, becomes computationally
intractable because its time complexity grows exponentially in the max-
imum number of allowed mutations (Domanic and Preparata, 2007;
Pellegrini et al., 2010). Therefore, we use a heuristic approach to this
problem. We ﬁrst identify ‘exact’ STRs with no mutations in each
short read using an efﬁcient O(n log n)-time algorithm (Main, 1989),
where n is the length of the read. A repetition is any non-empty string
of the form (p)mq, where p, a non-empty string, is called the unit of the
repetition, m 2 2, and q is a preﬁx of 1). For example,

(CAG)3CA = CAGCAGCAGCA

is a repetition of the form (p)mq, where p = CAG, m = 3 and q 2 CA, a
preﬁx of p. A repetition is maximal if it is not a proper substring
of a repetition that has the same unit. For example, consider the
following:

(CAG)2CA(CAG)2CA = CAGCAGCACAGCAGCA

(CAG)2CA, a repetition with unit CAG, is maximal. In addition, the
entire string is also a maximal repetition with unit (CAG)2CA. Listing all
maximal repetitions is sufﬁcient to identify all occurrences of STRs. We
performed the following steps to retrieve STRs from each read.

(1) Enumerate all maximal repetitions in a read using Main’s O(n log
n)-time algorithm, where n is the length of the read (Main, 1989).
More precisely, in 1984, Main and Lorentz designed an algorithm
for enumerating all repetitions of the form xx (Main and Lorentz,
1984). In 1989, Main modiﬁed the algorithm to calculate maximal
repetitions accurately (Main, 1989), and this is the version that we
used to implement our system.

(2) For each maximal repetition Y, identify the minimum unit U such
that U is not a repetition and Y is a concatenation of multiple
occurrences of U and a preﬁx of U. For example, when
Y: (CAG) 6CA, U: CAG.

(3) An approximate repetition is a substring such that its alignment
with repetition (U)m is decomposed into series of exact matches of
length |U| or more, and neighboring series must have only one
mismatch, one insertion or one deletion between them in the align-
ment, where I U | indicates the length of U. We calculate an approxi-
mate repetition by extending a maximal (exact) repetition in both
directions in a greedy manner. For example, given

CGCCCGCAGCGCAT(CAG)6CATCAGGGA,
we can extend repetition (CAG)6CA to the underlined substring,
CGCCCGCAGC-GCAT(CAG)6CATCAGGGA,

where bold letters represent mismatches and ‘-’ indicates a deletion.
In this way, we retrieve an approximate STR that is not necessarily
an exact repeat of the minimum unit U but may contain mis-
matches and indels.

(4) A read may contain multiple overlapping STRs with the same unit.

If two overlap, eliminate the shorter one. If both are of the same
length, select one arbitrarily.

central four copies of AGAGGC are an exact STR with no mutations, whereas the ﬂanking copies contain the mutations shown in bold letters. If one of
the regions (black) surrounding the STR aligns in a unique position, the STR can be located in the genome. (C) A read occupied by an approximate STR.
(D) Sensing STRs from frequency distributions of (AGAGCC)n in NA12877 (father of the HapMap CEU trio), NA12878 (mother) and NA18507 (an
African male). The x-axis is the lengths of STR occurrences detected in a read, and the y-axis is the frequency of reads containing STR occurrences of the
length indicated on the x-axis. Note that 100-bp long STR occurrences are frequent in NA12877, whereas no STR occurrences of length >70 bp are
observed in samples NA12878 and NA18507. (E) When a read is ﬁlled with an STR (red), we attempt to anchor the other end read (blue) to a unique
position unambiguously. (F and G) An STR is located easily if its location can be sandwiched using information on paired-end reads. The length of an
STR of length <100 bp is easily estimated (F), whereas determining the length of a much longer STR is non-trivial (G). We need to use third-generation
sequencers, such as PacBio RS, with the capability of reading DNA fragments having a length of thousands of bases

The algorithm is able to process 10 million reads of length 100 bases in
~1700 s on a Xeon X5690 with a clock rate of 3.47 GHz (Supplementary
Fig. S1). As the computational time is proportional to the number of
reads, ~47 h is required to process 1 billion 100-bp reads, conﬁrming the
practicality of the method for processing real human resequencing data.

2.3 Sensing expanded STRs by analyzing the frequency
distributions of STRs

The computational efﬁciency of our program facilitates the generation of
frequency distributions of all approximate STRs in reads according to
their lengths, as illustrated in Figure ID. We used three samples of the
whole-genome resequencing data downloaded from http://www.illumina.
com/platinumgenomes/with accession numbers NA12877 (father of the
HapMap CEU trio), NA12878 (mother) and NA18507 (an African
male). We assumed that short reads were of length 100 bp, which is the
typical length of reads output by cost-efﬁcient high-throughput sequen-
cers as of 2013. Although the length will likely increase in the near future,
extending our procedure to process longer reads is straightforward be-
cause our algorithm runs in O(n log n)—time for processing reads of any

length n as stated in the previous subsection. Comparing the distributions
of more than one sample sometimes uncovers such a remarkable STR for
which occurrences of length 100 bp are frequent in one sample (e.g.
NA12877), but are absent in the other two samples, NA12878 and
NA18507 (Fig. 1D), suggesting the presence of a long AGAGGC
repeat in the former sample (Fig. 1D).

2.4 Reproducibility of detecting STR expansions for
independent biological replicates

One might be concerned that despite the presence of a 100-bp long STR
in a sample, our method might fail to report this with some probability.
We examined this concern using two biological replicates collected inde-
pendently from an identical DNA sample. The two replicates were inde-
pendent datasets of 100-bp reads sequenced from the same DNA sample,
NA12878, using an Illumina HiSeq2000 (Supplementary Table S2).
One dataset was collected by DePristo et al. (2011) and the other dataset
was downloaded from Illumina’s platinum genome Web site (http://www.
illumina.com/platinumgenomes/). We applied our method to both biolo-
gical replicates (Supplementary Table S2) and examined whether 100-bp

112 /810's112umo[p101x0'soi112u1101u101qﬂ2d11q 111011 pepaolumoq

K.Doi et al.

 

occurrences of individual STRs were present simultaneously in both. We
identiﬁed 60 STRs with 100 bp occurrences in one (n: 13, 21.7%) or
both (12:47, 78.3%) replicates of NA12878 (Supplementary Table S3).
Of the 13 STRs with no counts in one replicate, 12 had one or two
occurrences in the other replicate and the remaining one had four in
the other. If an STR occurrence in the genome is short (e.g. 100 bp in
length), failure to observe the STR has a high probability (e.g. 50% for
50-fold coverage of reads assuming the random collection of reads).
Therefore, our method outputs essentially consistent results for the two
biological replicates.

This analysis also indicated that the failure to detect 100-bp occur-
rences of an STR did not imply the absence of a 100-bp expansion of
the STR in the focal personal genome. To be certain of its absence, we
examined if the frequency distribution of lengths of STR occurrences was
informative. Supplementary Figure S2 presents the frequency distribu-
tions of the 13 STRs in the two biological replicates. In most of the 13
STRs, when one biological replicate had 100-bp occurrences of an STR,
the other replicate had occurrences of length >90 bp, although for two
STRs, the longest occurrences were ~60 bp, which might stem from fac-
tors such as ampliﬁcation bias and variation in sequencing coverage.
Therefore, the absence of >60-bp STR occurrences does not necessarily
deny the existence of 100 bp expansions of the STR in the genome.

2.5 Locating long expansions of STRs in the human
genome

The genomic positions of each uncovered STR in a read remain to be
determined. The problem is solvable if one of the two regions ﬂanking an
STR maps to a unique position (Fig. 1B), the method used in lobSTR
(Gymrek et al., 2012). Otherwise, we attempt to use information on
paired-end reads, the two ends of an identical DNA fragment such that
their typical average length ranges from 300 to 350 hp with an average
standard deviation of ~10%. When one end-read is ﬁlled with an STR,
we test whether the other end maps to a unique position in the genome
using the Burrows—Wheeler Alignment Maximal Exact Matches algo-
rithm (BWA-MEM), a tool for aligning reads with the genome
(Li, 2013). If the test is successful, we can approximate the position of
the STR from the location of the other end (Fig. 1E). An STR can be
located if its location can be sandwiched using information on paired-end
reads (Fig. 1F and G). An STR shorter than 100 bp is easier to determine
(Fig. 1F), whereas estimating the lengths of longer STRs becomes more
difﬁcult (Fig. 1G). We will discuss this issue later in the text.

2.6 TRhist: a tool for sensing and locating STRs from
billions of short reads

To assist in the correct positioning of STRs, for a read with an STR
instance, our program outputs the repeat unit, length of the STR,
number of mutations in the STR, ﬂanking regions surrounding the
STR and other paired-end read. With this information, the user can
align the ﬂanking regions and other end read to the reference to locate
the STR in the genome. Our TRhist program is available at http://trhist.
gi.k.u-tokyo.ac.jp/.

2.7 SMRTTM sequencing of expanded STRs

Successful identiﬁcation of an accurate position for one end provides
useful input for other analytical methods, such as repeat-primed polymer-
ase chain reaction (PCR) Warner et al., 1996) and SMRTTM sequencing
(Eid et al., 2009; Loomis et al., 2013), to estimate or determine long
expansions of STRs. In particular, SMRTTM sequencing is capable of
reading DNA fragments of average length ~5 kb as of 2013 (Fig. 1G).
Using this emerging technology, Loomis et al. reported the ﬁrst sequence,
750 CGG repeats, for fragile X syndrome (Loomis et al., 2013). Using
SMRTTM sequencing, we ampliﬁed the repeat region associated with

SCA31 using PCR primers 1.5k-ins-F (5’ - ACTCCAACTGGGAT
GCAGTTTCTCAAT-3’) and 1.5k—ins—R (5’- TGGAGGAAGGAAAT
CAGGTCCCTAAAG-3’).

We will describe the analysis in the Section 3. PCR was performed in a
ﬁnal volume of 50,121 containing 0.2 ,uM of each primer, 200 ,uM of each
dNTP, lmM MgCl2, 1.25 U of PrimeSTAR HS DNA polymerase
(Takara Bio, Otsu, Japan) and 100 ng of genomic DNA. The PCR proﬁle
comprised an initial denaturing at 95°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles at
95°C for 20 s and 68°C for 8 min. The PCR product was puriﬁed on 0.8%
agarose gels and converted to the proprietary SMRTbellTM library
format using an RS DNA Template Preparation Kit 2.0 (Paciﬁc
Biosciences, Menlo Park, CA). Brieﬂy, the PCR product was end-
repaired, and hairpin adapters were ligated using T4 DNA ligase.
Incompletely formed SMRTbellTM templates were degraded with a com-
bination of exonuclease III and VII. The resulting DNA templates were
puriﬁed using SPRI magnetic beads (AMPure; Agencourt Bioscience,
Beverly, MA). Annealing was performed at a ﬁnal template concentra-
tion of 5nM, with a 20-fold molar excess of sequencing primer. The
annealing reaction was carried out for 2min at 80°C with slow cooling
to 25° C. Annealed templates were stored at —20°C until polymerase
binding. The DNA polymerase enzymes stably were bound to the
primed sites of the annealed SMRTbellTM templates using the DNA
Polymerase Binding Kit 2.0 (Paciﬁc Biosciences). SMRTbellTM template
(3 nM) was incubated with polymerase in the presence of phospholinked
(Paciﬁc Biosciences) nucleotides for 4h at 30°C. Following incubation,
the samples were stored at 4° C. Sequencing was performed within 36 h of
binding. Samples were sequenced using commercial sequencing chemis-
try. Sequencing data were collected on a PacBio RS (Paciﬁc Biosciences)
for 90 min. Given PacBio RS-ﬁltered subreads, we used the SMRT Pipe,
P_ErrorCorrection module to generate corrected reads. Subsequently, we
assembled these corrected reads using RS_CeleraAssembler to obtain
contlgs.

3 RESULTS

Here, we demonstrate the utility of an ab initio procedure for
sensing, locating and sequencing STRs that are signiﬁcantly ex-
panded in the case sample.

Locating candidate STR positions

Select positions where STR occurrences are expanded signiﬁ-
cantly in the case sample in the following manner:

(1) Locate occurrences of each candidate STR in both the case
and control samples by anchoring paired-end reads such
that one end has a 350-bp occurrence of the STR and the
other end maps to a unique position.

(2) Group paired-end reads anchored in a neighborhood
(within ~300 bp, the average insert size of paired-end
reads) into one cluster (Fig. 2).

(3) In each cluster, generate the frequency distribution of STR
occurrences according to their lengths ranging from 50 to
100 bp (Fig. 2). If an STR in the cluster is signiﬁcantly
longer than 100 bp, the frequency of 100-bp occurrences
in reads, denoted by flog, becomes signiﬁcantly greater
than the frequencies of those shorter than 100 bp
(Fig. 2B). We test this hypothesis statistically by checking
if flog is an outlier in the frequency distribution with the
Smirnov—Grubbs’ test. We calculate the t—score,
(flog — ,u.)/o, where ,u. and a are the mean and standard
deviation of the frequency distribution, respectively, and
obtain the probability (P-value) that the t—score exceeds a

pothesis testing using the Bonferroni correction to test if
each 300-bp region has a signiﬁcant STR expansion in the
case sample at a signiﬁcance level of 5% divided by 10
million (i.e. 5 x 10‘9). We select positions such that
P< 5 x 10‘9 in the case sample but no 100-bp STR occur-
rences are present in any of the control samples. We can
relax the condition to consider more candidates with less
evidence.

Sequencing candidate STR positions
SMRTTM sequencing of expanded STRs is performed using
information on the boundaries of individual STR positions.

3.1 A rare STR signiﬁcantly expanded in the case sample

To demonstrate the effectiveness of this approach, we ﬁrst exam-
ined a well-characterized case sample, SCA31 (Sato et al., 2009),
which contains long expansions of two STRs,
(AAAATAGAAT) repeat and (AATGG) repeat, in the introns
of genes BEANl and TK2 (Chr.16 66,524,303 in hg19), where
the reference genome has an (AAAAT) repeat.

We resequenced the genome of a sample from an individual
whose parent is a case of SCA31 using an Illumina HiSeq2000
(Supplementary Table S4). All primary sequencing data of the
SCA31 sample will be made available under controlled access
through the DNA Databank of Japan (DDBJ; accession
number JGAS00000000002). We examined whether we could
ﬁnd these STRs with no prior information. We applied the ab
initio procedure to SCA31 as the case sample, and NA12877,

NA12878 and NA18507 as control samples (Fig. 3A). Our pro-
cedure detected only one STR; AAAATAGAAT
(P: 1.07 x10—19).

Figure 3B shows the frequency distributions of the
(AAAATAGAAT) repeat, supporting the presence of long oc-
currences of the STR in SCA31 and the absence of long occur-
rences of length >60 bp in the other control samples.
Supplementary Figure S3A shows the distributions of the
(AATGG) repeat, but the difference between SCA31 and the
other samples was unclear because the (AATGG) repeat is en-
riched in human centromeres (Grady et al., 1992). Therefore, our
ab initio analysis suggests that long occurrences of the
(AAAATAGAAT) repeat characterize SCA31, consistent with
reported observations (Sato et al., 2009). Arguably, we could
detect the (AAAATAGAAT) repeat as an approximate
(AAAAT) repeat because the last half, AGAAT, is identical to
(AAAAT), except for the second base G; therefore, we analyzed
the frequency distribution of the (AAAAT) repeat to determine
the remarkable expansion of the (AAAAT) repeat in SCA31.
This failed due to numerous long instances of the (AAAAT)
repeat in all samples (Supplementary Fig. S3B). This example
indicates the importance of looking at STRs of repeat units
longer than 2—6-base units, to determine expansions of STRs
associated with cases.

We also examined the frequency distributions of other well-
characterized repeats, such as the (GGGTTA) repeat in telo-
meres (Supplementary Fig. S3C), (CAG) repeat encoding
polyglutamine stretches in protein coding regions (La Spada
et al., 1991; The Huntington’s Disease Collaborative Research
Group, 1993; Walker, 2007 and Supplementary Fig. S4A),
(CCTG) repeat associated with myotonic dystrophy type 2
(DM2; Liquori et al., 2001 and Supplementary Fig. S4B) and
(ATTCT) repeat associated with spinocerebellar ataxia type 10
(SCA10; Matsuura et al., 2000 and Supplementary Fig. S4C).
For the last three repeats, no signiﬁcant differences were detected
between SCA31 and the three control samples, suggesting that
these three repeats are not associated with SCA31.

Using paired-end reads with AAAATAGAAT repeats at their
5’ ends and uniquely mapped reads at their 3’ ends, we could
determine the 3’ end of the insertion. Figure 4A shows how we
locate a ~2.5—3.8kb insertion of the repeat associated with the
SCA31 sample (Sato et al., 2009).

We sequenced the repeat region in 11 SCA31 samples using
SMRTTM sequencing. We designed a pair of PCR primers
around the candidate repeat region in the SCA31 sample the
right boundary of which could be determined. As illustrated in
Figure 4A, we could identify the right boundary in the reference
genome because the right ends of many paired-end reads mapped
to the downstream region of the right boundary, whereas the left
ends did not. We could sequence the candidate repeat region.
Supplementary Table S6 presents the statistics of ﬁltered sub-
reads, corrected subreads and assembled contigs. Previously,
Sato et al. estimated a 2.5—3.8kb insertion of the following
form for an SCA31 sample (Sato et al., 2009):

Fig. 3. Sensing expanded STRs associated with SCA31. (A) Frequencies of 100-bp STRs that have >10 occurrences in one of SCA31, NA12877,
NA12878 or NA18507. For example, the arrow in the second lowest row shows that the (AAAATAGAAT) repeat is expanded only in SCA31. Our ab
initio procedure analyzes this bar chart and selects STRs that are signiﬁcantly abundant in the case sample (e. g., SCA31) but absent in all of the control
samples. The bar chart is also useful for conﬁrming the abundance of (AATGG) and (AACCCT) repeats, equivalent to the (GGGTTA) repeat, where
the former and latter motifs are known to be enriched in centromeres and telomeres, respectively. (B) Frequency distributions of the (AAAATAGAAT)
repeat. SCA31 has many 100-bp occurrences, whereas no occurrences of length >55 bp were observed in NA12877, NA12878 and NA18507

where (TAGAA | TGGAA | TGGGAA)k is a series of k occur-
rences of TAGAA, TGGAA and TGGGAA. In their sample,
they determined that i=2, k: 10 and 1:46, but left j and m
undetermined because both appeared to be extremely long. In
our 11 SCA31 samples, we could determine the values of j and
m. We found that the numbers of individual repeats varied mark-
edly(i=1~2,j=220~321,k=9~13,l:42~78andm=90~118)
and the insertion size ranged from 2350 to 3088b (Fig. 4C and
Supplementary Table S5), demonstrating the instability of the
STR expansion in SCA31. In particular, two STRs, (TAGAA)j
and (TAAAA TAGAA)m, form ~90% of the entire repeat ex-
pansion, and the values of j and m are positively correlated (cor-
relation coefﬁcient r: 0.70), implying that these two values are
the determinants of the instability of the repeat expansions in
SCA31 (Fig. 4D). In all samples, the repeat expansion was present
in one allele, but was absent in the other. Note that the numbers of
STR units might not be exact because PCR for repeat regions can
introduce more replication errors than those produced by bacter-
ial DNA replication (Loomis et al., 2013).

3.2 Common STRs signiﬁcantly expanded in the case
sample

We also applied our procedure to the SCA31 data, and examined
common STRs, AAAG, ATCC, AAAAG, AATAG and

AATGG, present in both the case and control samples but sig-
niﬁcantly expanded in the case sample. We identiﬁed STR ex-
pansions at 11 genomic locations that were signiﬁcantly
expanded in the case sample (P<5 x 10‘19 and Supplementary
Fig. S5). We then used SMRTTM sequencing to conﬁrm the four
expanded STRs in the case sample that were signiﬁcantly longer
than the corresponding STR occurrences in the reference genome
(Fig. 5 and Supplementary Fig. S6). No false-positive expansions
were found in this experiment, suggesting that the false-positive
rate of the procedure is generally low.

4 DISCUSSION

STRs in personal genomes remain largely uncharacterized. We
proposed a novel method for listing long approximate STRs with
mutations in personal genomes using a massive number of short
reads of length ~100 bp. Here, we discuss some situations in
which detecting a long expansion of STRs speciﬁc to disease
samples is inherently problematic. As genomic regions of GC
content >70% are difﬁcult to cover with an ample number of
Illumina reads, our method is unlikely to detect long expansions
of STRs with high GC contents. STRs in reads originating in
centromeres, telomeres or retrotransposons are too numerous to
map to unique genomic positions. As illustrated in

of amplicons can be found in Supplementary Figure S6

Supplementary Figure S3, massive numbers of long expansions
of these STRs can be found in any sample.

We also presented an ab initio procedure for detecting signiﬁ-
cant expansions of STRs in case samples that are absent in con-
trol samples via comparisons between the frequency distributions
of STRs in case and control samples. We demonstrated the po-
tential applicability of this method using three publicly available
control samples. To exploit this approach, however, constructing
a large-scale database of the frequency distributions of STRs
collected from a number of control samples is necessary.

The variety of expanded STRs of length >1 kb in disease re-
mains unexplored. Also, examining whether expansions of STRs
are more pronounced in germline and somatic cells would be
intriguing. Thus, after locating STRs, sequencing expanded
STRs is a promising direction of study. For this purpose,
SMRTTM sequencing enables the sequencing DNA fragments
averaging ~5 kb long as of 2013. Using SMRTTM sequencing,
we were able to determine a divergent set of 2.3—3.1kb STR
sequences in 11 SCA31 samples, showing the instability of
STR expansions. Analysis of the stability of STR expansions

in germline and somatic cells of a speciﬁc disease might eventu-
ally lead to the recognition of a functional role of STRs.

In the near future, the typical lengths of short reads in the
majority of commercial sequencers should increase to 150—500
bases. Our method is ready to process longer reads in a straight-
forward manner. Furthermore, our method was designed so that
it could output STRs of repeat units of any length, and we pre-
sented an illustrative case in which detecting STRs of a 10-base
repeat unit from an SCA31 sample was essential. Our program
will serve as a valuable tool for discovering unknown STRs in a
variety of diseases, even with future advances in sequencing
technology.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Detailed curation of published molecular data is essential
for any model organism database. Community curation enables re-
searchers to contribute data from their papers directly to databases,
supplementing the activity of professional curators and improving
coverage of a growing body of literature. We have developed Canto,
a web-based tool that provides an intuitive curation interface for both
curators and researchers, to support community curation in the fission
yeast database, PomBase. Canto supports curation using OBO ontol-
ogies, and can be easily configured for use with any species.
Availability: Canto code and documentation are available under an
Open Source license from http://curation.pombase.org/. Canto is a
component of the Generic Model Organism Database (GMOD) project
(http://www.gmod.org/).

1 INTRODUCTION

The major activity of any model organism database (MOD) is
the manual curation of gene-speciﬁc information from peer-
reviewed research articles, a time- and labour-intensive process
that involves reading publications and associating novel biolo-
gical information with genes or other biological features. Several
factors now motivate databases to develop alternative curation
strategies to supplement the efforts of professional curators to
maintain comprehensive annotation. Most pressingly, continuing
growth in both the number of papers published, and the amount
and complexity of information contained in a typical paper,
threatens to outstrip the capacity of database staff. In addition,
curators’ biological knowledge tends towards breadth rather
than depth; a curator may annotate a paper on an unfamiliar
topic in less than optimal detail, or make errors that experts
would avoid.

PomBase Wood et al., 2012), the MOD for the ﬁssion yeast
Schizosaccharomyces pombe, has introduced a community cur-
ation initiative that engages researchers in direct curation of their
publications, addressing issues of both literature volume and
specialized knowledge simultaneously. To support this, we have
developed Canto, a web-based tool that enables professional cur-
ators and publication authors to capture detailed biological

knowledge accurately and consistently, using ontologies from
the OBO Foundry collection (Smith et al., 2007). Canto can be
conﬁgured to use gene (or gene product) identiﬁers for any spe-
cies, as well as any of several ontologies, and can therefore be
readily adapted for diverse uses.

2 CURATION INTERFACE

Canto provides a simple, intuitive annotation interface that
requires no specialized training for use. The user is guided
step-by—step through the annotation procedure, ensuring that
all essential, and any optional, data required by a particular
MOD are collected.

In Canto, annotation is organized at the level of an individual
publication. For any paper, the ﬁrst curation step is to specify
the genes (or gene products) to be annotated. For each gene, the
user then selects a type of data to curate. The types of identiﬁers
allowed and the available data types are determined by conﬁg-
uration (see Section 4). Subsequent annotation steps are speciﬁc
to the data type.

User documentation is provided as web pages and mouse-over
tooltips. A destination for user requests, such as a helpdesk ad-
dress, can also be conﬁgured.

2.1 Curation using ontology terms

Most curation types in Canto use terms from bio-ontologies.
Current Canto implementations use the Gene Ontology (G0)
(The Gene Ontology Consortium, 2013) for function, process
and component annotations and PSI-MOD for protein modiﬁ-
cations (Montecchi-Palazzi et al., 2008). The PomBase Canto
instance uses the Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (Harris
et al., 2013) for phenotype annotation, but any other ontology
of precomposed phenotypes can be substituted. To simplify
ontology navigation for novice users, details of complex ontol-
ogy structure are hidden. Instead, the user types familiar search
strings, and then selects a relevant general term from a list of
matching term names and synonyms. The user is then directed to
the most speciﬁc applicable child term. Links to external ontol-
ogy browsers (such as AmiGO and QuickGO) provide access to
the ancestry and context of the term.

The interface then guides the user through subsequent steps
that gather evidence and additional supporting data. For ex-
ample, all ontology annotations require evidence, selected from
options tailored for the speciﬁc ontology. Phenotype annotations
capture details of alleles, expression levels and experimental

conditions. Finally, annotations can be transferred from one
gene to another, streamlining the curation process. Because an-
notations are made using precise ontology terms without free
text input, format and syntax errors are avoided. Users can,
however, provide comments pertaining to individual annotations
or to the whole article.

2.2 Interaction curation

In addition to assigning ontology terms to genes, users can curate
genetic and physical interactions. Starting from one gene, the
user selects an interaction type (physical or genetic), an interact-
ing gene and an experiment type. Canto is conﬁgured to use
BioGRID experiment types by default (Chatr-Aryamontri
et al., 2013).

2.3 Literature and curation management

Canto includes an administrator interface that supports litera-
ture- and curation-management tasks. Papers are retrieved from
PubMed according to administrator-speciﬁed criteria, such as
organism or publication date. Administrators can then use the
literature triage function to classify papers by type (e. g. curata-
ble, review, methods) and prioritize for curation. Administrators
can select and curate papers, or invite authors to curate publica-
tions. Users can also select their own papers for curation via a
publication search. Administrators can monitor curation pro-
gress, amend annotations in any active session and ﬂag curation
sessions as approved for public release.

3 METHODS

Canto is implemented in Perl using the Catalyst web framework
and other widely used Perl packages, and has been engineered to
ensure that new annotation types can be added easily. In its
standard mode of operation, Canto has no external dependen-
cies, although it can be conﬁgured to use web services to retrieve
gene and publication details. All data is stored locally using the
SQLite library. A CLucene (http://clucene.sourceforge.net/)
index of ontology term names and synonyms supplies sugges-
tions to the search autocomplete feature. A small amount of
J avascript is used on the browser side to make the application
more responsive.

Canto can export in J SON format for loading into databases
that use the Chado schema (Mungall et al., 2007), or for archiv-
ing or other applications. Curated GO data can be exported in
Gene Association File format (Balakrishnan et al., 2013).

4 CURRENT IMPLEMENTATIONS

The original implementation of Canto supports community cur-
ation for S.p0mbe literature, as part of the PomBase project.
Because many aspects of Canto, such as supported ontologies,
and gene/ gene product identiﬁers, are fully conﬁgurable, Canto

can be easily deployed for other organisms, with or without a
dedicated organism-speciﬁc database. We have set up two
additional Canto installations, illustrating its ﬂexibility. In a spe-
cies-speciﬁc example, literature triage for the yeast Komagataella
pastoris (formerly Pichia pastoris) has been completed, and an-
notation is planned (D. Dikicioglu et al., manuscript in prepar-
ation). A species-independent version of Canto supports GO
annotation using UniProtKB protein accessions. Current
Canto installations, including a demonstration tool, are access-
ible on the Canto home page (http://curation.pombase.org/).

5 FUTURE DEVELOPMENT

Canto will be enhanced to support ontology subsets, taxon
restrictions (Deegan et al., 2010) and annotation extensions
(R.P. Huntley et al., manuscript in preparation). We will also
incorporate semantic checks for logical consistency and compre-
hensive annotation. To improve efﬁciency, we will enable Canto
to link to TermGenie (http://termgenie.org; H. Dietze et al.,
manuscript in preparation), which streamlines the creation of
new GO terms. To increase interoperability, we plan to provide
functionality to export to GPAD (The Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2013) and other useful formats as needed.

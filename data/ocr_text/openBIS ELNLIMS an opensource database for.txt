Abstract

Summary: The open-source platform openBlS (open Biology Information System) offers an
Electronic Laboratory Notebook and a Laboratory Information Management System (ELN-LIMS)
solution suitable for the academic life science laboratories. openBlS ELN-LIMS allows researchers
to efficiently document their work, to describe materials and methods and to collect raw and ana-
lyzed data. The system comes with a user-friendly web interface where data can be added, edited,

browsed and searched.

Availability and implementation: The openBlS software, a user guide and a demo instance are
available at https://openbis-eln-Iims.ethz.ch. The demo instance contains some data from our Ia-
boratory as an example to demonstrate the possibilities of the ELN-LIMS (Ottoz et al., 2014). For
rapid local testing, a VirtualBox image of the ELN-LIMS is also available.

1 Introduction

Scientific recording is an essential part of research, as progress in science
depends among other factors on existing knowledge and reproducibility.
Recording is the process by which the scientific question, the choice of
an experimental procedure, materials and methods, data analysis and in-
terpretation of the results are gathered. Traditionally, all these details
were kept in paper notebooks.

In today’s academic life science laboratories, most raw data,
analyzed data and scripts are stored electronically, while the experi-
mental details are often recorded in paper notebooks. This makes
linking and retrieving experimental details and results problematic.
Moreover, the large amount of data produced by today’s readout
machines adds a level of complexity as the devices the data are
stored on might soon be outdated.

Databases represent a solution to store all the necessary informa-
tion together (Bird et al., 2013) because (i) they ensure long-lasting

data storage by being independent of the operating environment; (ii)
they are installed on a dedicated server, enabling long-term data
storage and regular backups; (iii) they allow storage of large
amounts of data; (iv) they are easily accessible via a local area net-
work or the Internet; (v) custom applications can be easily added.
Several commercial database solutions for ELNs are available, but
they are not commonly adopted by academia. An internal evaluation
among the research groups of the departments of Biosystems Science
and Engineering and Biology of ETH Zurich found that the options
affordable to academic labs had either unsuitable user interfaces (UI)
or lack of features. The combination of an easy-to-use UI, flexible
adaptation to a labs needs, support of an audit trail, physical support
of the data server, support for managing large amounts of data and
for integrating new measurement devices was only available at very
high costs. On the other hand, the available open-source platforms
lack many of the above features and, as they often originate from a

single person within a research group, they also lack maintenance and
support during the required data management life cycle.

Here, we describe the open-source database openBIS (open
Biology Information System) Electronic Laboratory Notebook and a
Laboratory Information Management System (ELN-LIMS), a soft-
ware specifically developed with academic life science labs in mind.
The structure of the database ensures that the results are represented
in a logical and meaningful fashion and it guarantees that the users
can find, understand and reuse the data. openBIS ELN-LIMS consists
of two interconnected parts: the LIMS, where the information about
materials and methods is stored and kept up to date and the ELN,
where data obtained from experiments are uploaded and annotated.
The system is based on the openBIS platform (Bauch et al., 2011),
which, since 2007, is actively developed and maintained by a dedi-
cated team of software engineers at the ETH and is productively used
in several academic institutions and a few private companies.

2 Results

2.1 System’s overview

Our goal was to implement a database to support the research activ-
ity of a typical biology laboratory. We conceived it as a tool to assist
everyday activities: storage of materials, methods set-up, design and
description of experiments, data labeling, storage and organization
of results. To this purpose, we based our system on the platform
openBIS (Bauch et al., 2011), as it has the necessary features
described above, is field-tested since about 7 years and known to
work well also with hundreds of terabytes of data.

The openBIS core has a predefined hierarchical structure (Fig. 1).
The top level, called Data Space, controls access and rights and con-
tains one or more Projects, which in turn contain one or more
Experiments. Samples are the basic unit of openBIS and are organized
in the Experiments. We adapted this hierarchical structure to describe

Fig. 2. Overview of a typical openBIS ELN-LIMS platform. The LIMS consists
of the Materials and Methods Data Spaces, where the Samples are organized
in Projects and Experiments. The ELN can have several Data Spaces assigned
to each researcher in the laboratory. Researchers can organize their own Data
Space by creating Projects, Experiments and Samples. Each Sample has a
unique identifier. For simplicity, Datasets are not illustrated here

the organization and the objects of a typical life science laboratory. We
defined the type and the number of Experiments and Samples and as-
signed customized properties to describe metadata. External files,
in any kind of format, are uploaded as Datasets to each Sample.
Each Sample can have any number of Datasets. We defined different
types of Datasets and defined appropriate sets of properties
(or annotations).

We used parent—child relationships linking Samples or Datasets
to describe the logical or physical connections existing between the
corresponding objects in the real world. We introduced the possibil-
ity to describe the nature of these relationships by annotating the
links using texts or keywords.

To ensure that the creation, modification or deletion of any elec-
tronic records is traceable, computer-generated, time-stamped audit
trails are used to record the date and time of the user’s intervention.
In addition, Datasets are immutable, and as such all modifications
made to the original data must be uploaded in separate Datasets
using version numbers. Last, access to the system is restricted to
authorized users, who can have different roles (Bauch et al., 2011).
All these features are in accordance to the FDA regulations for elec-
tronic records (FDA, 2003).

2.2 LIMS
The LIMS consists of two Data Spaces, the Materials and the Methods,
accessible and editable by all group members (Fig. 2, left side).

The organization of the materials of each laboratory can be
mapped to the structure of openBIS. Materials include reagents,
plasmids, cell lines, etc. Each of them is a Sample type described by
properties. For example, we have two plasmid collections: yeast and
mammalian. In the Materials Data Space, we create a Project called
Plasmids containing two Experiments: Yeast plasmids and
Mammalian plasmids. We upload Samples called Plasmids, having
properties like plasmid name, backbone, marker, etc. We upload
text files containing the DNA sequences to the corresponding plas-
mid entry as Datasets and integrate Plasmapper to visualize them as
a plasmid map (Dong et al., 2004).

A method consists of a series of steps to accomplish a task, using
several materials. Each method is described as a Sample type with
specific properties. For example, we create a Sample type called
western blotting with properties like western blotting name, mem-
brane, etc. We link western blotting Samples to material Samples,
such as Buffers, Chemicals and Antibodies and annotate the links
with the quantities needed for the method (Fig. 3). For instance, we
assign anti-ﬁ-Actin and Nitrocellulose to properties western blotting
name and membrane in western blotting 1. Then, we add 1 ,ug/ml of
Antibody A and 1% of Chemical B in 1 x Buffer C. In the database,
Antibody A, Chemical B and Buffer C are added as parents of west-
ern blotting 1 and are annotated with 1 ug/ml, 1% and 1 X, respect-
ively. Methods belonging to the same category are grouped in one

notations are mainly descriptions or comments

Experiment. For example, we sort the western blotting and the PCR
Samples into the western blotting Experiment and the PCR
Experiment.

2.3 ELN

In the ELN, experimental data are stored and described in a scientif-
ically meaningful manner, in terms of goal, method and interpret-
ation of the results.

Each user has a personal Data Space where he/she can create and
edit Projects, Experiments and Samples (Fig. 2, right side). An
Experiment is a specific scientific question and contains Samples
that are individual attempts to answer it. For example, to monitor
the expression of gene x, we performed real-time quantitative PCR
(RT-qPCR) and western blotting. In the database, we create an
Experiment called Gene >< expression and two Samples describing
the results obtained by RT-qPCR and western blotting. All materials
and methods used for each Sample are conveniently linked and can
be annotated with specific details (e.g. deviation from the protocol).
This ensures a complete description of the experiments and easy
back-tracking (Fig. 3). The results of the RT-qPCR and the western
blot can then be uploaded as Datasets to the corresponding
Samples. Importantly, the information about configurations or set-
up of the acquisition machines are stored in the Datasets as their set-
tings are specific to this result. In our example, the raw data, the
analyzed data and the analysis scripts are organized as separate
Datasets.

2.4 Interaction with the system

An essential aspect of a database is its ease-of-use. We implemented
an intuitive and easy user interface (ELN-UI) for the structure
described above. This interface can be used on desktops and other
devices, such as tablets. The ELN-UI main menu accesses the ELN,
the LIMS, the Utilities (containing a storage manager), a generic
search function and a BLAST search function (Altschul et al., 1990).
Samples of the same type are listed in tables whose columns can be
filtered with keywords. Single Samples can be selected to be visual-
ized or printed separately. Connections between Samples can be in-
spected and browsed via a tree-like visualization.

We enter new Samples by filling in a form in the ELN-UI or via
batch upload of text files. Data are uploaded as Datasets, either via
the ELN-UI or via “dropbox scripts”. These are written in Java or
Jython and automatically register data and metadata, which can be
directly imported from a data acquisition machine, like a micro-
scope. Export of metadata and data is done with an export function
from the ELN-UI or using dedicated scripts.

To set up the system, an administrator has to operate the previ-
ously described standard openBIS interface (Bauch et al., 2011).
This interface is needed for configuration of the underlying data-
base, as Data Spaces, Experiment, Sample and Dataset types and

properties are created and maintained from there. However, normal
users of the ELN-LIMS do not need to familiarize themselves with
this interface as the ELN-UI possesses all necessary possibilities for
everyday lab work and data retrieval.

3 Conclusion

We described an efficient ELN-LIMS based on the open source plat-
form openBIS. This platform is pre-set with sensible defaults and
ready for use. It can be customized and extended, as shown by the
integration of PlasMapper and BLAST. Further extensions could be
the integration of a function generating reports or the seamless inte-
gration of previously described openBIS extensions (Bauch et al.,
2011)

Initial use of a database requires a time investment to organize
the existing data, a learning phase and some security precautions.
Nevertheless, we find that openBIS ELN-LIMS is of great help and
worth the effort. Having all data stored in a single place and easily
accessible sped up work and facilitated data retrieval in our
laboratory.

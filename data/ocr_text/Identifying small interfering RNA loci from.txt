ABSTRACT

Motivation: Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are produced from
much longer sequences of double-stranded RNA precursors through
cleavage by Dicer or a Dicer-like protein. These small RNAs play
a key role in genetic and epigenetic regulation; however, a full
understanding of the mechanisms by which they operate depends on
the characterization of the precursors from which they are derived.
Results: High-throughput sequencing of small RNA populations
allows the locations of the double-stranded RNA precursors to
be inferred. We have developed methods to analyse small RNA
sequencing data from multiple biological sources, taking into account
replicate information, to identify robust sets of siRNA precursors.
Our methods show good performance on both a set of small RNA
sequencing data in Arabidopsis thaliana and simulated datasets.
Availability: Our methods are available as the Bioconductor
(www.bioconductor.org) package segmentSeq (version 1.5.6
and above).

1 INTRODUCTION

Small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) are short RNAs of ~20—25
nt in length cleaved from much longer double—stranded RNA
(dsRNA) precursors by Dicer or Dicer—like ribonucleases (Meister
and Tuschl, 2004). siRNAs are known to play a substantial role in
genetic and epigenetic regulation (Carthew and Sontheimer, 2009),
but a full understanding of the mechanisms by which siRNAs
themselves are regulated depends, in part, on the characterization
of the dsRNAs from which the siRNAs derive. It is clear that,
when two siRNAs derive from the same precursor, they must
share at least some upstream regulatory factors. As a result, the
abundances and functions of the siRNAs derived from the same
locus may be correlated, providing increased biological information
for downstream analyses.

dsRNAs are highly transient and not easily examined. However,
siRNAs that have been stabilized by association with some protein
complex [e. g. the RNA—induced silencing complex (Hammond
et al., 2000)] are relatively easy to characterize using one of the
technologies developed for high—throughput sequencing (Bentley,
2006; Margulies et al., 2005). When siRNAs are derived from

the same precursor dsRNA, we expect to see the sequenced reads
align to the genome in close proximity to each other and with
non—independent abundances. By looking for regions of the genome
which show an abundance of reads above background levels, we can
establish maps of siRNA loci on a genome. These loci approximate
the regions of the genome from which the dsRNA precursor is
transcribed. Identiﬁcation of siRNA loci from high—throughput
sequencing data must address a number of issues. In sequencing
siRNAs, we generally expect to also sequence other classes of small
RNAs (sRNAs) with alternative mechanisms of production. These
other sRNAs can, if they have been sufﬁciently characterized, be
ﬁltered from the sequenced reads. Alternatively, they can be allowed
to remain and be treated in the same way as the siRNA reads, as many
other types of sRNA reads will also be generated from some longer
precursor, and thus appear as a locus. In the worst case, these sRNA
reads will form an additional source of background noise within the
data. A degree of background noise is expected in any case, as a result
of sequencing errors and the presence of breakdown products from
longer molecules such as rRNAs, tRNAs and mRNAs, among other
factors. Consequently, not every sequenced read needs be associated
with an sRNA locus.

The greatest difﬁculty in identifying siRNA loci is the problem
of accumulation bias; within an siRNA locus, some of the siRNAs
will be stabilized by association with some protein complex and be
available for sequencing, while others will not. High variation in the
coverage of bases within an siRNA locus is therefore expected, with
some regions within an locus containing no sequenced reads at all.
These accumulation biases within siRNA loci distinguish the data
from those found in ChIP—Seq (Johnson et al., 2007) and mRNA—Seq
experiments (Wang et al., 2009). Solutions to the problems of peak—
calling in ChIP—Seq (Pepke et al., 2009) and transcript discovery in
mRNA—Seq (Garber et al., 2011), which in general depend on much
more consistent patterns of sequenced reads aligning to the genome,
are thus not directly applicable to siRNA locus discovery, and a new
set of techniques for the analysis of siRNA loci is required.

A further difﬁculty is the problem of multireads (MortazaVi et al.,
2008), sequenced reads that match to multiple places in the genome.
The siRNA loci show strong association with repetitive elements
such as transposons, and so many siRNA loci match multiple times
in the genome. Moreover, whole loci may be replicated exactly
(or nearly so) throughout the genome and should all be identiﬁed.

Previous attempts to identify siRNA locus maps (Kasschau et al.,
2007; Moxon et al., 2008) have taken a relatively naive approach to
deﬁning the loci. These methods look for genomic regions in which
the number of sequenced reads exceeds some minimum value and
there exists no large gap without an aligned sequenced read. The
NiBLs algorithm of (MacLean et al., 2010) develops this approach

by examining the density of sequenced sRNA reads upon the genome
via a graph—theoretic approach whereby sRNA reads are connected
if the genomic distance between them lies below some threshold
and a region is considered a locus if it is sufﬁciently connected.
Apart from the somewhat arbitrary nature of the thresholds used,
a substantial weakness of these approaches is that they allow the
analysis of at most two samples, neglecting replicate data. Existing
methods are thus unsuitable for robustly deﬁning siRNA loci from
large sequencing experiments.

We develop a novel set of methods for constructing siRNA
locus maps based on high—throughput sequencing of sRNAs from
replicated samples coming from diverse biological conditions. The
aim of these methods is to split the genome into non—overlapping
segments, of which some will be siRNA loci; regions from which
in at least some biological condition a dsRNA is expressed and
produces siRNAs, and some will be nulls; regions in which there
is no siRNA locus present in any observed biological condition.
The methods are shown to perform well on both simulated and
true biological data, and represent a signiﬁcant step forward in the
generation of stable sets of siRNA loci from sequencing data derived
from diverse experimental conditions.

2 METHODS

An overview of our methods is given in Figure 1. We begin by deﬁning
a set of candidate loci; those genomic regions for which it is worthwhile
to evaluate whether or not the region is (part of) a true siRNA locus. Our
methods also depend on the identiﬁcation of null regions within candidate
loci, and so we also identify the set of candidate nulls. We then develop
methods to classify the candidate loci and nulls as (part of) true loci and
nulls within each set of biological replicate samples.

In general, we would prefer to use empirical Bayesian methods to perform
these classiﬁcations. In order to do this, we must have previously deﬁned a
set of siRNA loci and nulls from which to make inferences on the behaviour
of the data associated with loci and nulls. This set may be acquired from other
sources, but in its absence we will apply heuristic methods to the data and
acquire an initial siRNA locus map. We can then use the empirical Bayesian
techniques to reﬁne the siRNA locus map.

The methods for classiﬁcation of the candidate loci and nulls form the core
of our method. We develop two distinct approaches to this problem. If no
siRNA locus map already exists, we acquire a ﬁrst classiﬁcation by applying

a heuristic method of low computational cost based on siRNA densities.
This approach provides a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to the siRNA locus
map, but fails to discriminate correctly between locus and null regions in
some cases, and does not take account of the reproducibility of data within
replicate groups. We thus develop empirical Bayesian methods that are able
to reﬁne an existing siRNA locus map by estimating the likelihoods that,
for each replicate group, a given region forms part of a locus based on the
data from all replicates. This approach takes account of the reproducibility of
data within each replicate group, but requires an initial siRNA locus map in
order to estimate parameters on the distribution of data. We use the heuristic
approach to generate this initial map.

The classiﬁcation of the candidate loci identiﬁes a large set of overlapping
regions as true siRNA loci, or parts of loci. These need to be interpreted
to form a consensus set of non—overlapping loci. We take an algorithmic
approach that identiﬁes a non—overlapping consensus set of loci based on our
biological expectations for the behaviour of siRNA loci. We are thus able to
segment the genome into loci and null segments. We then apply empirical
Bayesian methods to all the segments to determine posterior likelihoods
that any given segment is truly a locus; this allows us to provide lists of
segments ranked by the likelihood that they truly represent a locus. The
empirical Bayesian classiﬁcation of candidate loci and nulls can in theory be
iteratively applied to improve performance. However, in practice we ﬁnd that
further applications of the empirical Bayesian methods do not substantially
improve performance (data not shown), and given the computational cost of
repeatedly applying the methods, this may not be a useful strategy.

The data available for siRNA locus ﬁnding consist of a set of sequencing
libraries, each of which contains a set of sequences deﬁning sRNAs. Each
library will belong to a replicate group of samples from biological replicates,
and so the samples may be thought of as the set {A1, ' ~ ,Am} with a replicate
structure deﬁned by R: {R1, mRn} where ieRq if and only if sample A,- is
a member of replicate group q. The sequences from each sample are aligned
to a reference genome, creating a set of matches to the reference. In order
that data from samples sequenced at different depths may be compared, we
deﬁne a library scaling factor I,- for the i—th sample by taking the sum of the
counts of aligned reads with counts below the 75th percentile of the counts
of all aligned reads for that sample (Bullard et al., 2010). This method of
determining the library scaling factor ﬁlters out very highly expressed reads,
helping to stabilize the library scaling factors.

We deﬁne a segment starting at base Clj and ending at base bj as sj; the
length of the segment is then )vj = bj —Clj + 1. For each segment, we need also
to deﬁne a count l/ll‘j of the number of sRNA associated with this segment
for a sample i. The problem of multireads, sequenced reads that match to
multiple places in the genome, requires consideration here. We address this
problem by counting the total number of sequenced reads that match to the
genome within this segment from each sample, rather than the total number
of matches to this segment. Thus, if a sequenced read appears N times (the
count of the sequenced read) in the sequenced library i, but within a single
segment j matches the genome Q times, it will contribute a total of N, rather
than NQ, to the count  However, we allow this read to be counted in
each different segment to which it matches, thus allowing the discovery of
repeat—associated siRNA loci.

2.1 Principles of the empirical Bayesian analysis

We begin by establishing the principles of an empirical Bayesian analysis of
these data, adapting our previous work on differential expression analyses
of count data (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010). Both the classiﬁcation of the
candidate loci and nulls, and the evaluation of the posterior likelihoods of
the siRNA locus map, depend on an empirical Bayesian analysis of the data
and so we establish the principles in a fairly general form.

Suppose that we have two models for the data in replicate group q; Mg
and M3,. These model the number of sRNA sequences l/ll‘j that align within
a given segment sj under the condition that sj is a locus or a null in that
replicate group. We want to evaluate the posterior likelihoods of Mg and
MK, given the observed data for segment j. We wish to estimate the posterior

Identifying siRNA loci from HTS data

 

likelihoods of the models for each segment. To do this, we must ﬁrst acquire
a distribution for the parameters of the data given in the model. Given a
pre—existing siRNA locus map, we can construct prior distributions for the
data contained within the loci by taking some sampling (9,] of the regions
classiﬁed as loci. For each of these regions, we ﬁnd parameters deﬁning the
mean and dispersion of the data, giving a distribution of these parameters
for data within loci. If we have some previous estimate of the likelihood of
this region as a locus, we are able to reﬁne this distribution further. For any
given region, we are then able to assess the likelihood of the data associated
with that region given that the region is a locus. Similarly, we can construct a
distribution on the parameters for data within nulls, and assess the likelihood
of the data associated with any region given that the region is a null. Given
priors on the models, we can then calculate posterior likelihoods for each
model. We formalize this approach below.

Estimation of posterior likelihoods: suppose that we have some model M

describing the number of small RNAs that will align within a segment for

all the samples within a particular replicate group q. The posterior likelihood

of a generic model M given the observed data pertaining to segment sj is

given by

1P)({u,-j:ieRq};l,-,Aj |M)P(M)
 I l ERq}; li, Aj)

 

P(M|{M[j:i€Rq};li,)vj)= (1)
The primary challenge in calculating this posterior likelihood is that of
ﬁnding PqiEIPGul-j :i eRq}; lbhj |M), the likelihood of the data under the
model M. We assume that for a given replicate group R, and segment Sj the
counts l/ll‘j are distributed independently negative binomially with a dispersion
gbj and a mean proportional to both the library scaling factor 1,- of the sample
and to the length of the segment A], with constant of proportionality qu.

Distribution of parameters: now suppose that we have some distribution 6g
on the values (uq, gb). Then we can evaluate the likelihood of the count data
as

 l Mqa¢)P(Mqa¢|6q)d69

If we have a set of values (9,] that are sampled from the distribution of
6g, then we can derive the approximation

qu~|®ql Z

{qus¢k}€®q

 

P({utjii€Rq};lt,hjlug/am) (2)

We can acquire the set of values (9,] by sampling a random set of
non—overlapping regions from some appropriately chosen set of segments.
This set of segments should conform in some way with the model for which
a distribution is being sought; for example, if our model is that of loci, then
we will want to sample a set of segments which we believe to represent
loci.

Estimation of parameters from sample: for a speciﬁc segment sj, we have
the observed number of matches l/ll‘j of sRNAs within this segment from
each sample i. We assume that the number of matches in each sample are
independently negative binomially distributed, with the mean number of
matches for each sample i given by [Siqill-hj whenever i eRq, and that the
dispersion of data is gbj for all samples. We then take a quasi—likelihood

approach to estimate these parameters for the observed data. We ﬁrst deﬁne

fig,- =<{  :ieRq}>, and then choose gbj such that

. i-+ .‘1 _

where n is the number of samples. Using this value for gbj, we can then
re—estimate the values liq,- via maximum likelihood methods. We then iterate
on our estimations of gbj and liq,- until convergence. Then {fig-,qu) e (9,] for
each q. By repeating these calculations for a large number of sampled j, we
acquire the sets ®q for each q.

The larger the size of the sample used to generate the set ®q, the more
closely this set will estimate 6g and the more accurate the estimation of the

posterior likelihoods will be. However, increasing the sample size beyond
a certain point increases the computational time required by the analyses
without substantially affecting the estimated posterior likelihoods. In our
analyses of siRNA—seq data, together with previous work in the analysis of
sequencing data (Hardcastle and Kelly, 2010) we have found empirically
that a sample size of 105 is sufﬁcient to give stable and accurate results, and
this value is used throughout the analyses performed here.

Weighting the distribution: we can reﬁne the approximation given in
Equation (2) further by weighting the calculated parameters taken. If we
know that the likelihood of a particular sampled segment sk conforming to
our model M is qu, then we can derive the approximation

WjP({uzj I i ERq}; 1M]- | quaCbk) (3)

I
PQIWIZWkl Z

{qus¢k}€®q

where {uqk, gbk} e (9,] are the parameters derived from sk.

We can thus use either Equation (2) (if no likelihoods are available) or
Equation (3) (if likelihoods are available) to estimate the likelihood of the
data given some model M.

The key element of the estimation of the posterior likelihood of the model
M is the acquisition of the set (9,] by sampling from some set of segments
known to conform with the model M. Since we wish to ﬁnd posteriors for
the likelihood that a region is either a locus or a null, this means that we
need to have sets of loci and nulls from which to sample our data. Before we
can apply the empirical Bayesian approach, we therefore need an existing
map deﬁning loci and null regions. We can acquire this through heuristic
methods, and then improve our estimation of the loci using the empirical
Bayesian approach.

2.2 Identiﬁcation of candidate loci and nulls

In order to identify true loci and nulls, we ﬁrst need a set of candidate
loci and nulls to which we apply our classiﬁers. In theory, we can take an
exhaustive approach and consider every possible start and end within each
chromosome. For computational reasons, however, this is impractical, and
it is necessary to place restrictions on the set of candidate loci. We begin
by limiting the set of candidate loci to those that begin at the start site of
some sRNA match in at least one dataset, and end at the end site of some
(not necessarily different) match. We further restrict the set by requiring any
candidate locus that overlaps with a match to completely contain that match;
thus, if two matches overlap then they must be within the same locus. A
ﬁnal limitation is that no candidate locus contain a region within that locus
containing no matches whose length exceeds some limit A.

We next deﬁne the set of candidate null segments in terms of the candidate
loci. Four classes of these null segments exist: those acquired by considering
the empty regions between loci, those consisting of each candidate locus
extended into the empty space to the left, those consisting of each candidate
locus extended into the empty space to the right and those consisting of each
candidate locus extended into the empty space to both the left and right.

2.3 Methods for classiﬁcation of loci and nulls

Heuristic classiﬁcation: we can carry out an initial classiﬁcation of the
segments into loci and nulls using heuristic methods. For a replicate group
R, and segment Sj we can consider the mean density of sRNAs (measured
in terms of RKPM, or reads per kilo base per million sequenced reads) that
align within the segment;

109 wk
‘1l 2 — f
qu I ieRq M1

The simplest approach to classiﬁcation of segments is to deﬁne some
cutoff 8 on the density of sRNAs within a segment that implies the presence
of a locus. However, under this classiﬁcation scheme, very short empty
segments will be classiﬁed as nulls, which is unlikely to be appropriate.

A reﬁnement to this scheme is thus to deﬁne some minimum gap 4“ for null
regions. The classiﬁcation scheme then becomes

locus if Dql- > 8
null if Dql- g SAZqi >4“

unclassiﬁed if Dql- g 8 AZ,” 5;

Empirical Bayesian classiﬁcation: now suppose that we have some siRNA
locus map consisting of a set of non—overlapping segments 8 for which we
have already deﬁned for each segment Sj and each replicate group q the
posterior likelihood qu of the segment representing a locus. The acquisition
of these likelihoods for each segment is discussed below. We can then build
an empirical distribution for the parameters of the data for the candidate
loci and nulls based on this genomic map, and thus reﬁne our classiﬁcation
of the loci and null segments.

We ﬁrst determine whether some candidate locus can be classiﬁed as
a locus. A candidate locus should be classiﬁed as a locus if it lies within
a true locus. Conversely, a candidate locus should not be classiﬁed as a
locus if it lies within a true null region. We therefore seek to establish
the posterior likelihood that a candidate locus lies within some true locus,
given the observed data. We can calculate this posterior likelihood for each
candidate locus and each replicate group using Equation (1), together with
the approximations deﬁned by Equation (3).

Suppose that for a replicate group q, we have two models for the
behaviour of the data within a candidate locus. These models are slightly
different from those described by ME and M3, in that they look at the
distribution of data within the candidate loci, rather than the loci themselves.
Accumulation biases within loci can lead to candidate loci with low densities
of small RNA alignment. Conversely, localized background noise can lead
to some candidate loci within a null region having relatively high densities
of small RNA alignment. We, therefore, have two models M U, in which
the candidate locus exists within some true locus, and MN/, in which the
candidate locus exists within a null region.

We derive the set ®q for these models by taking a non—overlapping
random sample (without replacement) from the set of candidate loci that
lie wholly within some segment of the siRNA locus map. Suppose that the
candidate locus 1;, lies within some segment Sj. Then in order to establish the
likelihood of the data under model M L/ [via Equation (3)], the weighting qu
of the corresponding member of ®q is qu, the likelihood that the containing
segment Sj is a locus. Conversely, in order to establish the likelihood of
the data under model MN/, the weighting qu is 1— pg. This allows us to
establish the posterior likelihood of a candidate locus forming part of a true
locus via Equation (1). In order to classify a candidate loci as a locus, and
thus acquire an unambiguous siRNA locus map, we choose some minimum
value on the posterior likelihood for a candidate locus to be classiﬁed as a
locus. This minimum value might reasonably be anything >0.5 (so that the
candidate locus is more likely to be a locus than not); in practice, we ﬁnd a
likelihood of 0.9 ensures that only the high conﬁdence loci are considered,
and this value is used in the analyses presented in this article.

We next need to discover which of the candidate nulls that lie within the
regions we classify as loci are truly nulls. A true locus cannot contain a null
region, and so if a segment classiﬁed as a locus contains a null, we will
need to split that segment into two or more separate loci.

In classifying the candidate nulls, we assume that they can be modelled
either as a true locus or a true null, and so we use the original models Mg
and M,‘(,. We can then establish posterior likelihoods on the candidate nulls
as before, deriving the set (9,, by taking a sample from the set of segments 8.
To evaluate the likelihood of the data given the model Mg via Equation (3),
we weight each member of (9,, by the likelihood qu that the corresponding
segment j is a locus. Similarly, we evaluate the likelihood of the data given
the model M3, by weighting each member of ®q by the likelihood 1— pg]-
that the corresponding segment is a null.

the posterior likelihood of a locus being present for a given biological
sample. Green and blue colourings are used to allow nearby loci to be
distinguished from one another.

2.4 Constructing the siRNA locus map

Given a set of overlapping candidate loci and nulls, let us suppose we
have classiﬁed these regions as true loci or nulls within each replicate
group, allowing the possibility that our classiﬁer will be unable to determine
whether a segment is either a locus or a null in some cases. We use these
classiﬁcations of the candidate loci and nulls to deﬁne the siRNA locus map.

Null exclusion: we begin with the assumption that a true locus cannot contain
a null region within it. Suppose that some candidate locus l, is classiﬁed
as a locus in replicate groups ‘11,. If there exists some candidate null n5
contained within the candidate locus I, that is classiﬁed as a null in one or
more of the replicate groups ‘11,, we discard the locus 1,.

We then rank the loci that remain after excluding those that contain null
regions by the number of replicate groups in which they are classiﬁed as
a locus, settling ties by choosing the longer locus. We then ﬁlter these
segments by choosing all those segments that do not overlap with some
higher ranking segment to obtain a non—overlapping set of loci.

This process allows us to separate loci based on the pattern of differential
expression of the loci between two or more replicate groups. Figure 2
shows how this can occur; two loci are identiﬁed with no (or a small)
gap between them due to the identiﬁcation of very different patterns of
abundance of siRNAs between the replicate groups. These different patterns
of siRNA abundance suggest that two or more siRNA loci may be present
at this location; an inference that would be impossible to draw without
the simultaneous analysis of data from multiple biological sources. Further
examples of such regions are shown in Supplementary Figure 81.

Locus extension: we next wish to identify the nulls as the regions between
the ﬁltered loci. However, in some cases the ﬁltration step can lead to the
case where two loci are sufﬁciently close together that the region between
them should not be classiﬁed as a null, but instead incorporated into one
or both of the loci. This prevents large numbers of very short nulls from
distorting the maps.

Suppose that we have two loci l, and 1,, separated by a candidate null
n5, where the locus l, is classiﬁed as a locus in replicate groups ‘11, and the
locus l, is classiﬁed as a locus in replicate groups ‘11,. If ns is classiﬁed as a
null in at least one replicate group from both ‘11, and ‘11,, then we conﬁrm ns
as a null. However, if ns is not classiﬁed as a null in any replicate group in
‘11,, but is classiﬁed as a null in some replicate group in ‘11,, then we extend
the locus l, to cover the region n5. Similarly, if n, is not classiﬁed as a null
in any replicate group in ‘11,, but is classiﬁed as a null in some replicate
group in ‘11,, then we extend the locus l, to cover ns. If ns is not classiﬁed
as a null in any replicate group in either ‘11, and ‘11,, then we extend both I,
and l, (proportionally to their length) to cover the region ns.

Given some method for classifying regions as loci and nulls for each
replicate group, we can thus acquire a set of non—overlapping loci L and a
set of non—overlapping nulls N.

2.5 Likelihoods of loci

Suppose we have a map deﬁning some set of loci L, and a set of nulls N.
The union of these sets is a non—overlapping set of segments 8 that covers
the entire genome. However, for some of these loci, individual replicate
groups may not be expressed. Moreover, we believe that some of the loci,
or nulls, are incorrectly called, particularly in the heuristic analyses. We
thus seek to establish posterior likelihoods for each replicate group q that a
segment Sj conforms to a locus model M3 or a null model M3, based on an
empirical Bayesian analysis of the data.

We ﬁrst take a random sample of the loci in order to construct a set (95,”
from which we can assess the likelihood of the data given the model M3
[Equation (2)]. Similarly, a sample of the nulls allows the construction of
the set (93” from which we assess the likelihood of the data given the model
M3,. Equation ( 1) then gives us the posterior likelihood of each segment as
a locus or a null.

Given the posterior likelihoods of each segment as a locus or a null
in replicate group q, we then take a random sample from the set of
segments 8 to acquire the set Oq. By using the posterior likelihoods of
each member of the sample being a locus as the weightings qu, we
re—evaluate the likelihoods of the data for each segment given the model
M3 [Equation (3)]. Similarly, by weighting each member of the sample by
the posterior likelihoods of being a null, we re—evaluate the likelihoods of
the data for each segment given the model M3,. This allows the posterior
likelihoods of each of the two models M3 and M3, to be re—evaluated. We can
then iterate on the estimation of the posterior likelihoods until we achieve
convergence.

3 RESULTS

We test our methods using data from 14 samples (Gene Expression
Omnibus accession number GSE31211) of Arabidopsis thaliana in
which sRNAs from a variety of tissues have been sequenced. There
are six distinct replicate groups: sets of sequenced samples that can
reasonably be identiﬁed as replicates. Within a replicate group, we
expect to see replication of loci, that is, for a locus to be positively
identiﬁed it should appear consistently within all members of that
replicate group. However, a locus need not appear in all replicate
groups, as some siRNA loci will be expressed only in speciﬁc tissue
types, or due to technical effects, be found only in some library
preparations. The samples, and the methods used to process them,
are described in Supplementary Materials.

We next take the maps derived from the biological data and use
them to estimate parameters for simulation studies on which we can
compare the methods. The empirical Bayesian approach is shown to
offer substantial improvements over the heuristic methods in both
biological and simulated data.

3.1 Analyses of siRNA loci from A.thaliana

The sequencing data contains reads mapping to 5 038063 unique
locations. From this mapping, 8 405 236 candidate loci are identiﬁed
(using A = 100). The heuristic method, with a minimum RKPM
[reads per kilobase per million mapped reads (Mortazavi et al.,
2008)] of 2000 required for a locus to be identiﬁed, and a maximum
gap permitted within a locus of 100 bp (Section 2), 11031 loci
are discovered, covering ~1.41 Mb in total. When the posterior
likelihoods of the genomic segments are calculated, we ﬁnd that
10718 segments have a posterior likelihood of >50% of being a
locus in at least one replicate group, and that these segments cover
1.40 Mb. If we consider only loci with a >90% likelihood of being
a locus, we ﬁnd 7368 loci, covering 1.04 Mb.

Fig. 3. sRNA densities on a (repetitive) region on Chromosome 4 of
Arabidopsis. The heuristic methods (above) separate the region into multiple
small siRNA ‘loci’, while the empirical Bayesian methods call the region
as a single ‘locus’. Colour intensity indicates the posterior likelihood of a
locus being present for a given biological sample. Different colours are used
to allow nearby loci to be distinguished from one another.

Using the siRNA locus map from this heuristic analysis as a basis
for the emprical Bayesian methods, we ﬁnd 9229 loci, covering
~1.73 Mb in total. Examining the posterior likelihoods of the
genomic segments, we ﬁnd that 9199 segments have a posterior
likelihood >50% of being a locus in at least one replicate group, and
that these segments again cover 1.73 Mb, while 7485 segments have
a posterior likelihood >90% of being a locus in at least one replicate
group, covering 1.39 Mb.

Comparison of the siRNA locus maps demonstrates that the
heuristic method tends to identify sets of short loci that lie close
together upon the genome. In contrast, the empirical Bayesian
method is often able to identify these regions as part of some larger
locus, giving fewer but longer loci. Figure 3 and Supplementary
Figure S3 show examples of this; a region of the genome appears to
be over—segmented using the heuristic methods, in which many short
loci are identiﬁed within a moderately short region. The empirical
Bayesian method instead identiﬁes a single locus in this region.

The loci discovered can in some cases be veriﬁed. Mature
microRNAs (miRNAs), while produced by a different mechanism
(Bartel, 2004) to siRNAs, can be found in sRNA—seq experiments
and have been extensively studied. The miRNA loci appear in
the sequenced sRNA data as short, dense regions of sequenced
reads, qualitatively different to the majority of siRNA loci. Methods
speciﬁcally designed for the discovery of miRNA loci (Friedl'ander
et al., 2008; Yang and Li, 2011) that take into account hairpin folding
and sRNA distribution, are of course to be preferred to a purely
density based approach. Nevertheless, the methods developed here
for detecting siRNA loci are able to detect many miRNAs simply
on the basis of sRNA densities. Of the 180 miRNA loci identiﬁed
in The Arabidopsis Information Resource (version 10) (Swarbreck
et al., 2008), the empirical Bayesian methods identify segments
overlapping with 112 of the miRNA loci at a likelihood of >09 in
at least one of the replicate groups. The heuristic methods identify
segments overlapping with 103 of the miRNA loci at a likelihood
of >09 in at least one of the replicate groups. These are high
proportions given that different miRNAs are expressed at different
stages of development and in different tissues.

The best—studied candidates for siRNA loci are the TAS loci
(Vaucheret, 2005), from which sRNA production is induced from

A.thaliana for which exact genomic coordinates are known, all are
identiﬁed by both the heuristic and empirical Bayesian methods
(Fig. 4), although the heuristic method in general identiﬁes a smaller
region than the empirical Bayesian method within the deﬁned TAS
loci coordinates.

3.2 Comparison of locus ﬁnding methods on
simulated data

We next apply our methods to simulated data for which we know
with certainty the complete set of true positives. The simulation of
these data is described in Supplementary Materials.

We ﬁrst consider the ability of the methods to discriminate
between locus and null regions. We rank the discovered segments
by the maximum likelihood of their being a locus in one of the two
replicate groups, and, for the top n segments, examine the extent to
which each of them is contained within some true locus. If more
than some proportion p of the segment exists within a single true
locus, then we call this a true positive, otherwise, we consider it
a false positive. Figure 5a shows receiver operating characteristic
curves for these analyses for heuristic and empirical Bayesian loci
for various proportions p. The loci identiﬁed by empirical Bayesian
methods identify a lower proportion of false positives for high
proportions of true positives; moreover, nearly all true positives have
been identiﬁed with posterior likelihoods >50% in at least one of
the replicate groups.

We also assess the methods on their ability to accurately deﬁne the
true loci. We do this by again ranking the discovered segments by
the maximum likelihood of being a locus in one of the two replicate
groups, but now counting as true positives the highest rank segment
which contains some proportion p of a previously undiscovered true
locus, and does not extend the boundaries of this locus (in total) by
some limit I. Figure 5b shows the capacity of the methods to deﬁne
the true loci, requiring at least 90% of the true locus to be identiﬁed,
with various options upon the limit I. Where a low extension of the
boundaries of the true loci is permitted, this implies that the locus
detection methods must more precisely deﬁne the boundaries of

the locus. The heuristic method is able to perfectly deﬁne (l = 0) the
boundaries of more loci than the empirical Bayesian methods, but at
a cost of substantially increased false positives. When the conditions
on deﬁning boundaries are relaxed, the empirical Bayesian method
is able to detect more true positives with far fewer false positives
than the heuristic method.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a set of methods for the discovery of sRNA
loci from high—throughput sequencing. Two elements form the
key to our approach; a method for classifying any given region
as either a locus or a null region in each replicate group, and
an algorithmic approach for combining these classiﬁcations for
overlapping regions to generate a locus map. We propose two
methods of classiﬁcation; a heuristic approach based on the average
density of sRNA reads within a candidate locus for a given replicate
group and an empirical Bayesian approach that can reﬁne the output
from the heuristic approach by assessing the posterior likelihood
of a region as a locus for each replicate group. The empirical
Bayesian methods are considerably more computationally intensive
than the heuristic methods. Approximately, one thousand processor—
hours were required to compute the siRNA locus map for the
wild—type samples described here, although the methods are readily
parallelizable and the run—time can thus be much shorter than
this in practice. Despite the increased computational resources
required, the empirical Bayesian approach appears to offer a number
of advantages over the heuristic approach. In analyses on true
biological data, the empirical Bayesian approach identiﬁes more
miRNA—associated regions than the heuristic approach, and more
accurately deﬁnes the boundaries of the TAS loci. In comparisons on
simulated data, the empirical Bayesian methods identify more true
positives than do the heuristic methods, with fewer false positives
being detected. The empirical Bayesian methods also appear better
placed to deal with the problem of accumulation bias than the

Identifying siRNA loci from HTS data

 

heuristic methods, which may split what appears to be a single locus
into many separate loci.

It is clear that improvements might be made in any individual case
by adjusting the parameters of the heuristic method. However, it is
not possible in advance to know what these parameters should be,
nor to readily compare siRNA locus maps produced with different
parameterizations. Since the empirical Bayesian method depends
on the map produced by the heuristic methods, we might also
expect the performance of the empirical Bayesian method to vary
depending on the parameters used to characterize the heuristic map.
Supplementary Figures S4 and SS show how the performance of
the methods on the simulated data alters with different choices
for the minimum RKPM and maximum gap used to deﬁne the
heuristic map. The performance of the heuristic method does
show substantial variation according to the choice of parameters;
however, the performance of the empirical Bayesian methods is
much more robust. Given a sufﬁciently poor choice of parameters
for the heuristic method, the empirical Bayesian method will show
a degradation in performance as the initial map will be too far
from the truth to allow reasonable inferences to be made on the
distribution of the underlying parameters of the data. Nevertheless,
the empirical Bayesian method consistently shows an improvement
over the heuristic method regardless of the initial map, suggesting
that this approach may be usefully used on any existing siRNA
locus map. Given a reasonable ﬁrst approximation to the siRNA
locus map, the empirical Bayesian approach offers the advantage
that the majority of the parameters involved are estimated from the
data; thus, factors such as background noise and reproducibility of
results are automatically accounted for.

Our methods are a substantial step forward in locus ﬁnding
from hi gh—throughput sequencing data. Comparisons with the NiBLs
algorithm (MacLean et al., 2010), the most recent existing method
for detecting small RNA loci demonstrate that both the heuristic
and empirical Bayesian methods offer substantial improvements
in speciﬁcity (Supplementary Fig. S3). This is not surprising, as
the incorporation of replicate data allows much greater certainty
in distinguishing between true loci and background noise. Existing
methods for siRNA locus detection, which allow the analysis of
only one or, at most, two samples, are unlikely to show similar
performance to the methods developed here. Crucially, our methods
incorporate replicate data from any number of replicate groups,
and, as such, are able to deﬁne robust siRNA locus maps from
large datasets. This represents a signiﬁcant advance over previous
methods, which were unable to take into account data from
replicate groups or to assess data from more than one or two
samples.

We envisage that the application of these methods to sufﬁciently
large datasets will allow the deﬁnition of robust siRNA locus maps,
which will be made publicly available for use in downstream

analyses, avoiding the computational costs involved in regenerating
maps for each study and allowing easier comparison of results
between experiments. Methods for easily incorporating new data
into existing locus maps are also being developed. Although we have
not explored the possibility here, we are hopeful that these methods
may also be useful on other high—throughput sequencing data which
produce broad, ﬂat regions rather than peaks, for example, chromatin
modiﬁcation ChIP—Seq data.

Abstract

Summary: We have developed CiVi, a user—friendly web—based tool to create custom circular maps
to aid the analysis of microbial genomes and sequence elements. Sequence related data such as
gene—name, COG class, PFAM domain, GC%, and subcellular location can be comprehensively
viewed. Quantitative gene—related data (e.g. expression ratios or read counts) as well as predicted
sequence elements (e.g. regulatory sequences) can be uploaded and visualized. CiVi accommo—
dates the analysis of genomic elements by allowing a visual interpretation in the context of: (i) their
genome—wide distribution, (ii) provided experimental data and (iii) the local orientation and location
with respect to neighboring genes. CiVi thus enables both experts and non—experts to conveniently
integrate public genome data with the results of genome analyses in circular genome maps suit—

able for publication.

1 Introduction

Circular genome representations provide an excellent way to com—
prehensively inspect genome—wide data. Various tools have been de—
veloped to generate these circular visualizations including CGView
(Stothard and Wishart, 2005), Genomer (Conant and Wolfe,
2008), GeneWiz (Hallin et 61]., 2009) and DNAPlotter (Carver et 61].,
2009). Tools such as BRIG (Alikhan et 61]., 2011), CGView
Comparison Tool (Grant et 61]., 2012), Circos (Krzywinski et 61].,
2009) and Circleator (Crabtree et 61]., 2014) can also visualize gen—
ome comparisons and in some cases, visualize links between genome
sequence and other types of information. The tools described above
are well—suited for the visualization of high—throughput genomic
data like sequence—similarities or read counts, but have limited func—
tionality in relation to smaller—scale activities such as reconstructing
transcription networks and finding gene functions associated to

genetic elements. Moreover, with the exception of GeneWiz (Hallin
et 61]., 2009), they require laborious and sometimes complex uploads
of genome and annotation data. In 2013 we published MGcV
(Overmars et 61]., 2013), a linear—genomic context visualization tool
tailored to provide a simple and quick visual access to the publicly
available genomic data from NCBI (Pruitt et 61]., 2012). The tool
incorporated the capabilities of the earlier MGV (Kerkhoven et 61].,
2004), and extended the visualization with data export options to
advance the gene—specific analysis of microbial genomes. We now
present CiVi, which has been developed using the same philosophy,
to extend the circular viewing options provided by the original
MGV. The extensions include the possibility to display annotation
data like COG category, PFAM domain or subcellular location dir-
ectly on the genome map and to reveal the position of selected anno—
tations through a keyword search option. CiVi also enables the

upload and visualization of custom data, such as the positions of
genomic elements and the export of associated data. The latter in—
clude the function annotations and/or sequences of neighboring
genes, as well as information on the distance distribution of the
elements with respect to the genes. The resulting circular maps can
be edited and the pictures exported in svg—, png— and pdf—format.
Finally, CiVi offers a completely new interface and back—end with
enhanced usability, interactivity (via mouse—over) and speed.

2 Usage and implementation

CiVi enables users to create custom circular microbial genome maps
in a simple step—wise fashion, adding data ring by ring. The interface
consists of a panel on the right in which the map is displayed and
four panels on the left related to the different menus, labeled: (i)
‘Genome and data selection’; (ii) ‘On display’; (iii) ‘Data import’;
and (iv) ‘Elements and genomic context’. For every ring the user can
subsequently set (panel i): the organism and genome of interest, the
type of information, the coloring and the radius of the ring. The
types of information that can be included directly are: the location
of the genes on the —l—strand and —strand, COG categories (NCBI
RefSeq), GC%, GC—skew and AT—skew (calculated; Overmars et al.,
2013), PFAM domains, and subcellular location predictions
(PSORTdb; Nancy et al., 2011). A keyword matching option allows
highlighting genes whose gene product, gene name, COG code or
PFAM ID match a query. In addition, the coordinates and a title or
background coloring can be added, and gene—associated quantitative
data can be represented by either (bar graph like—) spikes or by a
red—to—green gradient. The categorical data have been linked to fixed
colors. Map additions are tracked in the ‘On display’-panel, in
which added rings can also be removed. Users can upload three
types of data in the ‘Data import’—menu: quantitative data (e.g. ex—
pression ratios), the predicted position of sequence elements (e.g.
regulatory elements) and/or custom color schemes to designate any
genomic region in the genome map. Different genomes can be
included in a single circular map, but as synteny is not determined
this feature should only be used with very closely related genomes.

2.1 Analysis and visualization of sequence elements

An integrated view of genome—wide experimental data and the pre—
dicted location of particular regulatory elements can be very allusive
in the analysis of transcriptional networks (as illustrated in Fig. 1
and supplementary file S1). The position of any particular genomic
element with respect to the location and orientation of the surround—
ing genes can hint at the biological role of that element. CiVi gener—
ates plots in the ‘Elements and genomic context’—panel for each
uploaded set of sequence elements, in which both the distance to the
neighboring genes and the orientation with respect to the genes is
summarised (Fig. 1B). Similarly, the biological role of a particular
element may be derived from the functional characteristics of the
gene context. The user can download the positions and the annota—
tion data for the gene context for subsequent analysis using the
‘Generate context table’-link.

2.2 Implementation

CiVi is a web—application developed using a combination of python,
javascript, MySQL and SVG. CiVi was implemented as a single
page application; the front—end makes server side calls through
Jquery and AJAX and receives a response from the server. The maps
can be downloaded in SVG, PNG or PDF format, where conversions
are done using ‘Batik Rasterizer’. The maps in SVG—format can be

Fig. 1. (A) Application of CiVi in the analysis of genome structure and gene
regulation. A comparative visualization of the genomes of the closely related
Bacillus species B. subtilis str. 168 (genes and COG annotation on outer two
rings) and B. amyloliquefaciens DSM 7 (next two rings) shows that the former
genome contains a region that seems to have been inserted (indicated by or-
ange box) and which is clearly associated with a deviating GC percentage
(5th ring). In Bacillus species carbohydrate uptake and metabolism is gov-
erned by a phenomenon called ‘carbon catabolite repression' which is medi-
ated by CcpA. CcpA binds to a characteristic DNA operator sequence called
are, located just upstream of the regulated gene(s). Variability between the
operator sequences was assumed to cause a variability in the response de-
pending on the level of repression (Francke et al., 2008). The postulated oper-
ator dependent variable response was tested experimentally and confirmed
(Marciniak et al., 2012). All of the characteristic properties of CcpA mediated
regulation are apparent in an integrative visualization of the transcription fac-
tor binding site predictions (6th and 8th ring), gene expression data (7th and
9th ring) and the gene annotation (COG category ‘carbohydrate transport and
metabolism'; 10th ring). (B) The provided analysis of the genomic context of
the predicted CcpA binding sites confirms the validity of the input motif; as it
is mainly found upstream of genes and close to the translation start

Firefox, Chrome and Internet Explorer.

3 Conclusion

CiVi is a versatile and easy—to—use web—application to create custom
circular genome maps. It provides a visual integration of publicly
available genomic data and additional provided data, the latter
including e.g. gene expression data and genomic elements. The func—
tional analysis of latter elements is aided by the characterization of
their genomic context, a feature that is unique to CiVi.

Abstract

Summary: Seq2pathway is an R/Python wrapper for pathway (or functional gene-set) analysis of
genomic loci, adapted for advances in genome research. Seq2pathway associates the biological
significance of genomic loci with their target transcripts and then summarizes the quantified values
on the gene-level into pathway scores. It is designed to isolate systematic disturbances and com-
mon biological underpinnings from next-generation sequencing (NGS) data. Seq2pathway offers
Bioconductor users enhanced capability in discovering collective pathway effects caused by both

coding genes and cis-regulation of non-coding elements.

Availability and implementation: The package is freely available at http://www.bioconductor.org/

1 Introduction

Functional gene-set analysis (fGSA) improves biological interpret-
ability of genomic features with respect to prior knowledge and has
led to important biological discoveries (Khatri et al., 2012). Its
power lies in the fact that it detects statistical significance over an
entire dataset of gene-sets and yields biologically meaningful inter-
pretations (Subramanian et al., 2005). Recently, researchers revealed
driver pathways that predispose individuals to disease (Vandin
et al., 2012) and shed light on the development of targeted therapy
(Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2013) by performing fGSA on genes prox-
imal to significantly disease-associated loci. However, with the
increasing growth of genomic sequencing measurements, non-
coding regulatory loci pose a critical challenge to fGSA, as nearly
99% of the nucleotides in the human genome do not code for
proteins but instead richly harbor functional regulators of genes
(Kellis et al., 2014).

‘Gene-based’ fGSA methods neglect non-coding regulatory infor-
mation because they have no readily annotated gene function and
cannot be assigned to a specific biological pathway. For example,

a popular tool for discovering cis-regulatory regions before any sub-
sequent fGSA, links genomic loci to only the nearest genes (Wang
et al., 2011). Other fGSA algorithms take into account single-
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) only located in or near coding genes
(Koster et al., 2014; Nam et al., 2010) or exonic mutations (Boca
et al., 2010; Gonzalez-Perez et al., 2013; Leiserson et al., 2013).

‘Sequence-derived’ fGSA regarding the functional impact of not
only coding genes, but also non-coding regulators, is necessary. A
growing body of evidence supports the strategy of connecting gen-
omic loci and coding genes using a many-to-many mapping and con-
sidering long-distance cis-regulation. First, non-coding regions
richly harbor functional regulatory elements in humans (Kellis et al.,
2014; Schierding et al., 2014). Second, nearly half of the disease-
associated SNPs are located in gene deserts (Visel et al., 2009).
Third, our recent study suggests that a disease-associated SNP
located in an intron could be the enhancer of a neighboring gene ra-
ther than of its host gene (van den Boogaard et al., 2014).

The first sequence-derived fGSA method is GREAT (the
Genomic Regions Enrichment of Annotations Tool) (McLean et al.,
2011). GREAT quantifies an fGSA score by determining if the total

number of loci within the regulatory domain of genes in a gene-set is
greater than expected. The ChIP-Enrich method then empirically
adjusts the length of the gene body and its surrounding non-coding
sequence (Welch et al., 2014). However, both GREAT and ChIP-
Enrich treat all loci equally, despite the fact that a threshold for sig-
nificance is always experimentally context-dependent and arbitrary.

We propose a new sequence-derived fGSA tool named
‘seq2pathway’ that fills the non-coding region gap in fGSA by con-
sidering quantitative sequencing measurements. We initially de-
veloped FAIME (Functional Analysis of Individual Microarray/
RNAseq Expression) to compare the cumulative quantitative effects
of genes inside an ontology (set of functionally related genes) with
those outside, thus overcoming a number of difficulties in prior
fGSA methods (Yang et al., 2012). We here provide the community
a Bioconductor package that (i) quantifies the functional impact of
both coding genes and non-coding loci, (ii) generalizes four fGSA
methods, including FAIME, to variable next-generation sequencing
(NGS) data and (iii) wraps gene locus definitions for human and
mouse genomes from the GENCODE project (Harrow et al., 2012)
into R objects.

2 Main features

Seq2pathway is designed for knowledge discovery using a variety of
NGS data (e.g. ChIP-seq, RNA-seq, SNPs, etc) by taking the contri-
bution of non-coding loci and their experimental significance scores
into consideration. Users can apply the ‘seq2pathway’ function
jointly, or in a two-step algorithm consisting of ‘seq2gene’ and ‘gen—
e2pathway’ components separately (For workﬂow see
Supplementary Fig. S1).

The seq2gene step links both coding and non-coding regions to
coding genes in a many-to-many mapping (For detailed Pseudo code
see Supplementary Fig. 52) (Yang et al., 2015b). Using seq2gene
with a search radius of 100kb, our recent study in vivo defined a
novel cis-regulatory element from both ChIP-seq and transcriptomic
data (Hoffmann et al., 2014). Compared with other methods, seq2-
gene outputs candidate targets with detailed loci-to-gene mappings
(e.g. exon, intron, CDS (CoDing sequence), UTR (UnTranslated
Region), promoter and neighbor). This feature allows researchers to
understand the function of the region and design creative down-
stream analyses for the genomic locus hits, an effort only previously
achieved by annotation tools HOMER and ChIP-Enrich.

The gene2pathway step integrates several cutting-edge fGSA al-
gorithms, characterized by the improved FAIME method
(Supplementary Fig. S3). We also provide other three alternative
methods: Fisher’s exact test, the Kolmogorov—Smirnov test, and the
cumulative rank test (Subramanian et al., 2005 ). All of these
implemented analyses condense gene-by-sample measurements
(gene profiles) to gene-set-by-sample measurements (gene-set
profiles), which are gene-coverage-difference tolerable and free of
gene-set size preference for gene-sets with five or more genes
(Supplementary Figs 54A, 56A, and SSA).

Significance of biologically-defined loci of genomic aberrations
or functional elements has been lacking of attention than their recur-
rence. Confidence of threshold-based significance is likely to depend
on the choice of genomic background and the test statistic; thus, em-
pirical approaches are recommended (Glaab et al., 2012).
Seq2pathway calculates empirical P-values for each gene-set in a
sample by shufﬂing the gene scores derived from genomic locus hits
of this sample to generate gene-set scores from the null hypothesis.
This empirical assessment overcomes common biases of gene length

in pathway analysis of NGS data (Supplementary Figs 54B and
56B).

Additionally, we collapsed significant scores per gene when a
gene was mapped to multiple neighboring genomic loci, removing
the bias of linkage disequilibrium for the downstream pathway ana-
lysis (Supplementary Fig. S6C).

Finally, researchers can run seq2pathway against user-supplied
gene-sets and the wrapped Gene Ontology (GO). This feature essen-
tially allows unbiased comparisons of methods and results.

3 Case study

To highlight the earlier features, we demonstrate the application of
seq2pathway on a variety of different NGS datasets, point out the
novel insights obtained only by seq2pathway, and summarize the
take home message (Supplementary Document).

We first compared seq2pathway with ChIP-Enrich and GREAT
to test GO enrichment in a set of H3K27me3 peaks using the same
criteria (Supplementary Fig. SS, false discovery rate (FDR) < 0.01,
count 25 and search radius 2 5 kb). Both seq2pathway and GREAT
identified the biological process GO:0008285 (negative regulation
of cell proliferation), while seq2pathway concentrates better with
less identified GO terms than the other two methods. Interestingly,
the significance of GO:0003705 (distal enhancer region for RNA
polymerase II), a molecular function significantly enriched by bi-
valent genes marked with both H3K4me3 and H3K27me3 (Li et al.,
2013), was obtained only with seq2pathway (Supplementary Fig.
SSB).

We next tested 460 human height-associated SNP loci and com-
pared the output with the seq2pathway (setting the parameter

SNP = T) to the results of GREAT (Binomial FDR < 0.05, observed
regions >3, region fold enrich >2). We applied a search ra-
dius = 5 kb for both methods. The valuable biological processes ob-
tained only with seq2pathway include GO:0001701 (in utero
embryonic development) that was predicted recently (Fig. 1) in a
comprehensive study on human height (Wood et al., 2014).

When we applied seq2pathway to RNA-seq data, individualized
gene-set profiles allow the derivation of statistics at the pathway
level directly rather than at the gene level. The advantages of seq2-
pathway lie in noise and dimension reduction, its desired biological
interpretability, as well as a platform for novel integrative systems
biology analysis (Yang et al., 2015a)

4 Conclusion

It is a breakthrough in genome analytics coordinates to assign region
significance scores such as binding affinity estimates from ChIP-Seq
onto a uniform gene-set scale. This feature facilitates the integrative
analysis of multiple datasets (Yang et al., 2015a). The most critical
issue in functionally interpreting genomic loci is to bridge non-
coding regions with gene function. Seq2pathway offers the capacity
to discover collective pathway effects caused by long-distance
cis-regulation of non-coding elements. Importantly, seq2pathway
enhances an alternative tool to integrate a number of ‘omics’
datasets into a condensed space of quantitative gene-set scores.
This functional level integration will help generate assumptions,
constraints, and interpretation in systems biology.

ABSTRACT

Summary: We present the Sample-based Laboratory Information
Management System (SLIMS), a powerful and user-friendly open
source web application that provides all members of a laboratory with
an interface to view, edit and create sample information. SLIMS aims
to simplify common laboratory tasks with tools such as a user-friendly
shopping cart for subjects, samples and containers that easily
generates reports, shareable lists and plate designs for genotyping.
Further key features include customizable data views, database
change-logging and dynamically filled pre-formatted reports. Along
with being feature-rich, SLIMS’ power comes from being able to
handle longitudinal data from multiple time-points and biological
sources. This type of data is increasingly common from studies
searching for susceptibility genes for common complex diseases
that collect thousands of samples generating millions of genotypes
and ovenNhelming amounts of data. LIMSs provide an efficient way
to deal with this data while increasing accessibility and reducing
laboratory errors; however, professional LIMS are often too costly
to be practical. SLIMS gives labs a feasible alternative that is easily
accessible, user-centrically designed and feature-rich. To facilitate
system customization, and utilization for other groups, manuals have
been written for users and developers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genetic studies of complex diseases that interrogate the human
genome are known as genome-wide association (GWA) studies.
They require both high-throughput genotyping platforms and
large samples sizes—with thousands of subjects from multiple
sources and time points—t0 clearly deﬁne the contributions of
common alleles associated with common complex diseases. To
obtain the large sample sizes needed, GWA studies have led to
international consortia formed from smaller studies, with differences
in study designs and quality control procedures. If not dealt

with appropriately, these situations can lead to decreased data
accessibility, increased laboratory errors and an overall reduction
in operational efﬁciency. Laboratory information management
systems (LIMSs) provide solutions for these situations; however,
the perception that learning to use new software will be time-
consuming and difﬁcult can be a signiﬁcant barrier to the adoption
of a LIMS (Anderson et al., 2007). This situation is worsened
by the high turnover rate of research staff—resulting in recurrent
training costs—and the lack of user-centric designs in open source
LIMS—resulting in steep learning curves. In searching for a solution
to the challenges we faced managing our biological samples, we
failed to ﬁnd any open-source systems that would provide adequate
functionality for our needs. We developed Sample-based LIMS
(SLIMS) to make available a feature-rich system capable of handling
longitudinal data and to increase the presence of user-centric design
in LIMSs. SLIMS is based on a previously published LIMS:
PASSIM (Viksna et al., 2007).

2 FUNCTIONALITY

SLIMS manages information for subjects, the biological samples
they have provided and the containers (plates or boxes of tubes)
used to store and ship them. Each level of abstraction provides
the user with more power; they can choose to deal with wells
individually, all the wells of a plate, all the samples from one subject,
all the plates containing a sample from one subject, etc. At each
level, users can View, edit and create new entries. Data integrity is
protected by validating input and controlling which users’ accounts
have privileges to edit and create different ﬁelds. Accounts also
specify their users’ roles in the lab. Because statisticians and database
administrators (so-called ‘dry lab’ staff) may be interested in very
different information than laboratory (or ‘wet lab’) staff, SLIMS has
tailored default View schemes that are fully customizable. This cuts
down on the confusion caused by information overload. A user’s
preferred View scheme is remembered every time they log in,
so that a user can make the system their own and maximize its
efﬁciency.

SLIMS features several new tools that expedite experiment
operations while ensuring complete record keeping and facilitating
intra-lab communications. The most broadly successful of these is
a ‘shopping cart’ that allows users to create, store and share lists
of subjects, samples and containers. Lists can be created by anyone
in the lab and populated by selecting elements singly, adding the
results of a search or uploading a ﬁle. Being able to share these
lists directly through SLIMS can be useful in labs spread over

several rooms, buildings or disciplines because it imposes structured
veins of communication with set vocabularies. It also reduces the
use of personal spreadsheets, which can become out of sync or
indecipherable if the creator leaves.

Lists allow wet lab staff to perform batch operations such as
volume updates or plate creations. When a new plate is designed in
SLIMS, record keeping is automatically linked with the production
of documents that aid in plate creation (a map of a plate’s samples
and a ‘recipe’ of sources detailing how much of which samples from
where are to be used). Lists of plates can be used to design plates,
serving cases such as the mechanical combination of four 96-well
plates into one 384-well plate for TaqMan genotyping (Heid et al.,
1996). SLIMS integrates record-keeping and lab operations for this
process by giving the user a tool to design their new 384-well plate,
which in one stroke makes a record in the database and creates an
import ﬁle necessary for machine operation. New plates can also be
created without the use of lists, simply from pre-existing plates. A
plate cloning tool allows the user to make a new plate and sample
records, adjust the volumes of the source well records and print off
documents for plate creation, all in one step.

To facilitate preparation for genotyping, SLIMS features a
customizable, criteria-based sample selector and plate layout design
tool. Given a list of subjects in a study, the sample selector allows
a user to deﬁne a hierarchical tree of criteria that SLIMS uses to
retrieve the most appropriate sample for each subject. Once the
initial selection process has been performed, the user can then
manually curate the results: if they reject a particular sample, the
‘next-best’ will be presented and so on. When the ﬁnal set of samples
is ready, it is stored in a ‘shopping cart’ list. This list can then be
used with the plating tool, which designs plate layouts, makes plating
documents for the wet lab and updates records of the new plate and
the source samples.

All of the data updates that occur while using these tools—0r any
other SLIMS function—are logged in the supporting database. This
automatic, detailed and reversible record keeping encourages lab
members to use the system even if they are as yet unfamiliar with
it by providing them with a safety net. Higher level data tracking is
made possible by the availability of dynamically ﬁlled, preformatted
reports created using Jasper Reports technology (J asperSoft, 2009).
Further, any search result or ‘shopping cart’ list can be exported to
a delimited text ﬁle.

Providing users with a powerful, feature-rich system—such
as SLIMS—empowers them to increase their efﬁciency and
productivity. However, if a system appears complex and feels
overwhelming it can have the exact opposite effect. To ensure a high
level of user-acceptance, all interfaces were designed with formal
user testing and a detailed user manual describing all Views, tools
and features was produced.

3 DISCUSSION

The consequences of incomplete user acceptance of a LIMS are
very serious. Even the best professional systems lose value—
and can even become detrimental—if they fall out of date
because of inconsistent use. In a busy laboratory, instructing
staff to use a new system can only have so much effect;
successfully achieving consistent usage requires incentives in
addition to instruction. To this end, SLIMS aims to combine
record-keeping with features that save time and simplify daily

laboratory tasks. We have taken a three-pronged approach to achieve
this goal. First, facilitation of bench-top procedures is integrated
with record keeping in SLIMS by the automatic production of
documents required for procedure completion. Second, we have
ensured that the user’s experience is as easy and efﬁcient as
possible by formally involving a broad spectrum of users in
the development process from requirements analysis to interface
design and testing. This approach allowed us to map different
user-groups’ mental models of a LIMS system and incorporate
them in our design, making the system more intuitive for users.
Though focusing development on users instead of programmers
reduces a system’s learning curve, it cannot be erased. Our third
prong focused on easing and accelerating the learning process
with user manuals and instructional text throughout the system.
Though SLIMS’ applicable scope may be limited by a setup
targeting sample-based laboratories and tools targeting genotyping
workﬁows, the approaches to LIMS development described above
incorporate widely applicable, well-established techniques (Debbie
Stone et al., 2005) that are lacking in existing open-source
LIMS. Documentation, source code, and manuals are available at

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Complex physiological relationships exist among human
diseases. Thus, the identification of disease associations could
provide new methods of disease care and diagnosis. To this end,
numerous studies have investigated disease associations. However,
combinatorial effect of physiological factors, which is the main char-
acteristic of biological systems, has not been considered in most
previous studies.

Results: In this study, we inferred disease associations with a novel
approach that considered disease-related clinical factors in combina-
torial ways by using the National Health and Nutrition Examination
Survey data, and the results have been shown as disease networks.
Here, the FP-growth algorithm, an association rule mining algorithm,
was used to generate a clinical attribute combination profile of each
disease. In addition, we characterized the 22 clinical risk attribute
combinations frequently discovered from the 26 diseases in this
study. Furthermore, we validated that the results of this study have
great potential for drug repositioning and outperform other existing
disease networks in this regard. Finally, we suggest a few disease
pairs as new candidates for drug repositioning and provide the evi-
dence of their associations from the literature.

1 INTRODUCTION

Complex physiological relationships exist among human dis-
eases. Thus, the identification of disease similarity has been
used to study etiology and pathogenesis of similar diseases
(Kalaria, 2002), as well as have provided novel ways for disease
diagnosis, drug repositioning (Barabasi et al., 2011; Goh et al.,
2007; Suthram et al., 2010). Therefore, many studies to elucidate
disease associations have emerged, and the results of which have
been presented as disease networks (DNs). Previous studies of
DNs can be classified into two categories based on the used data,
molecular data and electronic health record (EHR) data.

From a molecular perspective, Goh et a]. constructed DNs
that were linked if they shared one or more disease genes (Goh
et al., 2007). Following Goh’s study, functional module—based
studies by using molecular data have also appeared to clarify

disease associations. Lee et a]. created DNs that were linked if
the enzymes related to diseases shared metabolic reactions (Lee
et al., 2008). In addition, Suthram et a]. (2010) also built DNs by
an integrated analysis of disease-related mRNA expression data
and the human protein interaction networks. Here, two diseases
were linked if they had similar profiles of 4620 functional mod-
ules that were described by differently expressed genes of the
disease. Park et a]. (2011), more recently, published the article
of disease associations by considering both disease-related pro-
teins and their localization in a cell.

The other approach for constructing DNs based on EHR data
have also emerged. EHR data have usually been used for obtain-
ing comorbidity, which implies the presence of one or more dis-
eases in addition to a primary disease that the patient has. For
example, Hidalgo et a]. (2009) introduced DNs obtained from
the disease history of more than 30 million patients. Roque et a].
(2011) also presented networks from phenotype information
including both structured and unstructured electronic patient re-
cords, such as free-text diagnosis reports. Furthermore, Holmes
et a]. (2011) introduced ADAMS for discovering disease associ-
ations using multiple sources, such as PubMed articles, discharge
summaries and so on.

However, previous studies overlooked the combinatorial
effect, which is one of main biological characteristics.
Combinatorial effects exist in biological system, and biological
factors inﬂuence a disease in combinatorial rather than individ-
ual ways.

As evidence, studies for combinatorial effects in biology and
physiology have recently appeared. In molecular biology ﬁeld,
Knijnenburg et a]. (2009) presented that most Saccharomyces
cerevisiae genes were shown to be inﬂuenced by combinatorial
effects of cultivation parameters. These combinatorial effects led
to higher explained variance of the gene expression patterns. Liu
et a]. (2011) showed that the combination of rapamycin and
lapatinib signiﬁcantly decreased growth of triple-negative
breast cancers. We also explored some clinical studies devoted
to identifying the combinatorial effects of diseases (Bruzzi et al.,
1985; Emmons et al., 1994; Gorell et al., 2004; Stamler et al.,
1993). Furthermore, the combinatorial approach has been
applied in adverse drug event field. Harpaz et a]. (2010) extracted
multi-item adverse drug events from the Food and Drug
Administration’s adverse effect reporting system by using
association rule mining. All of these studies have shown that
combinatorial effects exist in physiological system and are
worthy to be regarded to elucidate diseases and disease
associations.

The fundamental assumption of previous studies, on the other
hand, is that higher association exists between diseases as more
disease-related factors are shared individually, not combinator-
ially. Especially in Goh’s study (Goh et al., 2007), individual
sharing genes is a measure of similarity. However, even though
two diseases share disease genes, the etiological factors of each
disease could be totally different due to the combinatorial effects
on biological factors.

For example, there are two diseases sharing disease genes, gene
A and B. One disease occurs when both gene A and gene B are
not working properly; however, the other disease presents when
gene A or gene B is not functioning. Then, it is hard to conclude
that these two diseases have a perfect association (more explan-
ation in Fig. 1). Thus, when we try to get more precise and
accurate association between diseases from a biology perspective,
combinatorial effect proﬁles of them should be analyzed. This
explanation can be applied to other molecule-based studies and
EHR-based studies in the same manner.

From this background, we present a novel approach that con-
siders disease-related physiological factors in combinatorial ways
for inferring disease associations. Here, we decided to use clinical
data, rather than molecular data or comorbidity data. Molecular
information is incomplete and should be further explored, even
though much knowledge has been discovered by development of
recent technology and analysis. On the other hand, clinical data
provide practical explanations of disease associations and is
becoming available to researchers in massive amounts (Holmes
et al., 2011).

disease cause proﬁle could be different in real biological system because
of combinatorial effects, and two diseases might be rarely associated
(lower half)

The National Health and Nutrition Examination Survey
(NHANES; http://www.cdc.gov/nchs/nhanes.htm), a major clin-
ical survey of the National Center for Health Statistics, was used
as primary data for this study. Molecule and comorbidity data
were incorporated to evaluate the results of this study in evalu-
ation part as well.

In this article, we constructed the DNs from the information
of disease-related clinical attribute combinations (Fig. 2). In add-
ition, we generated the 22 clinical attribute combinations
frequently discovered from the 26 diseases concerned in this
study, named as ‘Clinical Risk Attribute Combinations
(CRACOMs)’. In the evaluation section, we showed that the
results of this study have great potential to be used for drug
repositioning and outperform other existing DNs in this
regard. Furthermore, we investigated a few disease pairs as can-
didate disease for drug repositioning and present some valuable
evidence of the associations.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data introduction

NHANES is a program of studies designed to assess the health and nu-
tritional status of adults and children in the USA. NHANES is a major
survey of National Center for Health Statistics, which is a part of the
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Owing to some characteris-
tics of this survey that are various data, including both interviews and
physical examinations data, and own sequence number to every sample
person, many researchers have used it for epidemiological studies and
health sciences research (Healy et al., 2011; Looker et al., 2010).

Fig. 2. Overall procedures of this study. In the data preparation part, we
organized combined datasets, each of which is composed of both the case
and control data of each disease, from integrated NHANES data. In the
method part, we obtained disease-speciﬁc CLACOPs, each of which
turned out to affect each disease, by applying an association rule
mining algorithm to the combined datasets. From these CLACOPs, we
generated CLACOVs and calculated similarities between CLACOV pairs
for the purpose of deducing similarities between disease pairs. We con-
sidered 26 diseases in this study

2.2 Data preparation

For the purpose of this research, we obtained large-scale clinical infor-
mation by integrating from 1999 to 2010 Questionnaire and Laboratory
data from NHANES, resulting in the 62 160 instances and 3812 attributes
(Fig. 3a). From the integrated NHANES dataset, we generated the case
dataset of each disease, which was composed of instances that had the
disease in the past. Among many diseases included in NHANES data, we
selected 26 diseases, each of which has more than 450 instances in a case
dataset. Then, we applied a ﬁltering algorithm to each case dataset so as
to ﬁlter out instances and attributes having more missing values than the
predeﬁned threshold. After ﬁltering, each case dataset has its own in-
stances and attributes (Fig. 3b). To analyze all of 26 diseases impartially,
we decided to use the only 73 attributes shared among 26 disease case
dataset (Supplementary Table S1). Next, we appended a control dataset,
which contains instances that are not related to the disease, to the cor-
responding case dataset to construct a combined dataset (Fig. 3c).

After constructing combined dataset, we transformed every value in
the dataset into a binary value based on reference range of each attribute
(Supplementary Table S1) (Iverson et al., 2007). In this transformation,
we mapped every value to either 1 (if a value does NOT lie in reference
range) or 0 (if a value lies in reference range). As the last step, Random
imputation overall method was applied to all combined dataset to impute
missing values (Kalton and Kasprzyk, 1982). These datasets were used as
an input of an association rule mining algorithm

2.3 Clinical attribute combination proﬁle

As we mentioned in the introduction part, a disease occurs by plenty of
causes, and these causes inﬂuence a disease in combinatorial ways rather
than in independent ways. Therefore, analysis of clinical factors in com-
binatorial ways is necessary to research disease associations. To this end,
for each of the 26 diseases, we obtained Clinical Attribute Combination
Proﬁle (CLACOP) composed of a set of disease-speciﬁc clinical attributes
that are considered to inﬂuence the disease in combinatorial ways.

The shared attributes among 26 ﬁltered case dataset (Alﬂ . . . OA26) were
selected and used. The number of shared attributes is 73 (Anl...26)
(Supplementary Table S1). Finally, we appended control dataset to
case dataset to construct combined dataset

To generate a CLACOP of each disease, the FP-growth algorithm, one
of the efﬁcient association rule mining algorithms, was applied to each
combined dataset. The FP-growth algorithm needs much lower comput-
ing power than the Apriori algorithm, as it is applied to binary dataset,
which is a characteristic of the preprocessed combined dataset.

When we use FP-growth algorithm, three thresholds such as support,
conﬁdence and max number of attributes should be determined.
However, it was ambiguous and not easy to set above three thresholds
because the ﬁnal results, both disease similarities (correlations) and asso-
ciations, could be different according to them. For setting the appropriate
thresholds, we experimented on the whole procedures (refer to section 2.3,
2.4, 3.1) with 17 sets of different thresholds and generated disease correl-
ation ranks for each threshold (Supplementary Table S2). Then, we mea-
sured their Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcients in pair-wise manner,
resulting in subtle difference among them (Supplementary Table S3). In
the end, we selected the thresholds (support: 0.05, conﬁdence: 0.7, max
number of attributes: 5) to be used in the main experiment, having the
highest Spearman’s rank correlation coefﬁcient compared with the aver-
age disease correlation rank (Supplementary Table S4).

Therefore, WEKA program (Hall et al., 2009) was used for running
the FP- growth algorithm with three thresholds (support: 0.05, conﬁdence:
0.7, max number of attributes: 5) to each combined dataset (Fig. 4a).
Among the rules that the FP-growth algorithm have generated, we se-
lected rules having the corresponding disease attribute only in consequent
part. Here, the antecedent of the selected rules was postulated as a clinical
attribute combination that affects the corresponding disease in combina-
torial ways (Fig. 4b). Then consequently, we generated a set of clinical
attribute combinations (CLACOP) for the disease. By performing
the same procedure to 26 diseases, ﬁnally, we obtained 26 CLACOPs
(Fig. 4a).

2.4 Disease similarity calculation

For identifying disease similarity in quantitative, we transformed 26
CLACOPs to a Clinical Attribute Combination Vectors (CLACOVs)
of the disease. Then, we applied the cosine similarity method to a pair

of CLACOVs for calculating similarity of two diseases. Here, we decided
to use the cosine similarity method because the method has been numer-
ously used in text mining area when determining how two records are
similar (Bilenko and Mooney, 2003; Larsen and Aone, 1999), which is
analogous to this procedure. Cosine similarity is given as

When we generated a CLACOV, we assigned the conﬁdence of the
rule to the corresponding clinical attribute combination (Fig. 5a). As a
result, we generated 26 CLACOVs by using 26 CLACOPs and their
conﬁdence scores. Then, the cosine similarity method was applied to a
pair of CLACOVs, and they were regarded as similarities between two
diseases (Fig. 5b).

3.1 The disease correlation matrix

For calculating more reliable and unbiased disease similarities,
overall procedures were repeated ﬁve times with different control
dataset, which were selected randomly from each control data
pool (Supplementary Figure S1). In the end, the CLACOV-shar-
ing disease correlation (similarity) matrix was constructed with
the average similarities. We Visualized it in Figure 6a, and the
correlations were described in Supplementary Table S5.

To analyze and compare the disease correlation matrix (DCM)
in detail, we also constructed three other DCMs based on differ-
ent entity such as gene, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)
and patient data. We applied the individual approach (not the
combinatorial approach), which is the conventional approach for
DNs, for generating those three DCM. To this end, we calcu-
lated the similarity between a pair of diseases, indicating how

CLACOVs. The union of two CLACOPs was created in every disease
pair similarity calculation so that the cosine similarity method was able to
be applied to a pair of CLACOVs, and those results were regarded as
similarities between two diseases. Here, we presented imaginary examples
for making it easy to understand

many entities (gene, SNP or patient) are shared. For example,
for generating gene-sharing DCM, we generated a list of genes
known to be associated with each disease, and the disease simi-
larity (correlation) was calculated based on how many genes are
shared between a pair of diseases. The similarity is deﬁned as

N(gk n 34)
x/N(gk) >< ./N(gq)

where N(gk) is the number of genes used to disease k, and N(gk ﬂ
gq) is the number of genes used to both disease k and disease q.
SNP-sharing, patient-sharing DCM were also generated with the
same way used for gene-sharing DCM (Supplementary Fig. S2).
Their correlations were speciﬁed in Supplementary Table S6, and

When comparing the DCM of this study with the others, es-
pecially with gene-sharing DCM, we see many expected disease
correlations such as the similarities among heart attack, angina
and congestive heart failure. In addition, well-known correlation
between failing kidneys and heart diseases was also discovered.
We also see some unexpected correlations such as the gout and
heart disease correlation as well as the cataract and heart failure
correlation.

3.2 The disease networks

For assigning significance to the obtained disease similarities
(correlations), we generated a background distribution of disease
similarities by random chance for each pair of diseases. To this
end, for each disease, we prepared a randomized combined
dataset, in which we shufﬂed case and control instances ran-
domly. Then, we tried to generate CLACOP with the same
threshold used in this study (support: 0.05, confidence: 0.7,
max number of attributes: 5). However, few clinical attribute
combinations for each disease resulted that few disease pairs
have non-zero similarities. That is because thresholds, especially
confidence, were too strict to generate any clinical attribute com-
binations from randomly shufﬂed dataset. Therefore, we applied
lower confidence (0.55) for obtaining background distribution.
Because the confidence is directly used for calculating a disease
similarity, adjusting confidence than other thresholds could give
more reasonable results. Finally, we created background distri-
butions for each pair of diseases by repeating the whole process
100 times (Supplementary Table S7).

Next, we selected only those disease pairs having less P—value—
like significance score than 0.0001 (FDR-like score=0.01%),
resulting in 260 significant disease associations (Supplementary
Table S7), and we constructed the final DNs by using those as-
sociations. (Here, the terms such as ‘P—value—like’ or ‘FDR—like’
have been used because different confidence thresholds were
applied to compute the foreground and background disease simi-
larities.) We, however, decided to visualize the networks in sup-
plementary material (Supplementary Fig. S4), as it shows a
complicated picture. Instead, the DNs consisting of edges that
have higher correlations than 0.35 were built and shown in
Figure 6b.

3.3 Clinical risk attribute combination

Furthermore, we analyzed the results to discover clinical attri-
bute combinations associated with various types of diseases. We
postulated that there exist the clinical attribute combinations that
are prevalent in various diseases because diseases are associated
with each other in some way. By investigating those combin-
ations, causes of comorbidity or pathogenic patterns of diseases
can be analyzed. Thus, we characterized CRACOMs that are
clinical attribute combinations appeared in 17 or more diseases
among the 26 diseases, resulting in 22 CRACOMs (Supplemen-
tary Table S8). The CRACOMs would be worth elucidating
further for disease etiology and comorbidity.

4 EVALUATION

4.1 Potential for drug repositioning

Knowledge of a disease similarity based on combinatorial clinical
factors could be applied to find new uses for existing drugs.
Similar diseases share similar symptoms or clinical factors and
could be potentially cured by similar drugs. To this end, we
checked the potential that this study is able to be used in drug
repositioning by comparing with drug-sharing DNs, which were
built based on drug-sharing DCM.

For constructing drug-sharing DCM, we used the same
method that was used to construct gene-sharing DCM (2). In
detail, we generated a list of drugs known to be associated with
each disease, and the disease similarity was calculated based on
how many drugs were shared between a pair of diseases. Finally,
we could obtain drug-sharing DCM, resulting in drug-sharing
DNs.

Drug-sharing DNs have been regarded as reference DNs in
this evaluation. We constructed two reference DNs according to
resources (Supplementary Fig. S5). The first reference was built
based on DrugBank, PharmGKB and TTD database, all of
which contains information of approved drugs. The second ref-
erence was built based on clinicaltrials.gov database, which con-
tains information of drugs that are not approved yet but in
the process of trials on patients (Supplementary Fig. S6 and
Table S9).

After constructing the reference DNs, we extracted 30 disease
pairs in CLACOV-sharing DNs that have higher similarities
than others (top 30 ranked disease pairs), and we compared
those pairs to top 30 ranked disease pairs of two reference
DNs. It resulted in that 18 disease pairs and 15 diseases pairs
shared, respectively, and for both, P<0.0001 (Supplementary
Fig. S7). Thus, we concluded that the result of this study is
worthy to be used for drug repositioning. Additionally, we clo-
sely examined 18 disease pairs that shared with the first reference
networks (Supplementary Fig. S8). In results, some disease pairs
are biased toward several disease classes such as cardiovascular
disease and respiratory disease. The reason for the bias, which we
have concluded, is that NHANES data mainly contain the inf or-
mation of the prevalent diseases such as diabetes, stroke and
heart attack. In addition, reducing diseases by the preprocessing,
which filtered out the diseases having more missing values than
the threshold, could be one of the causes. In the future work, we
are planning to construct DNs with increased disease coverage
by using more various data.

4.2 Outperformance in drug repositioning field

There exist many disease similarity studies based on other data,
such as gene, SNP and comorbidity, and they might provide
better information to drug repositioning research than this
study. Thus, we compared the performance of CLACOV-sharing
DNs with other DNs to see how better performance we could
offer.

To this end, we built three DNs based on gene-sharing DCM,
SNP-sharing DCM and patient-sharing DCM (comorbidity),
which were generated in section 3.1. For each DN (CLACOP-
sharing, gene-sharing, SNP-sharing and patient-sharing DNs),
we measured how many disease pairs share with reference DNs

among top-k ranked disease pairs while k was increasing from 1
to 50 (Supplementary Fig. S9). This evaluation shows that this
study outperformed other approaches (Fig. 7). Therefore, we
believe that CLACOP-sharing DNs potentially give useful infor-
mation to drug repositioning ﬁeld.

The combinatorial approach in this study could give one ex-
planation of this good performance. When a drug is taken to the
body, the drug gives rise to a few effects including an expected
effect because the biology system of the body is intricate. Then,
the combinatorial action of them (biological system basically
functions in a combinatorial manner as mentioned in introduc-
tion part) leads to a phenotypic effect such as cure of disease
(Fig. 8a). Thus, if two diseases share the combinatorial proﬁle
that is highly correlated to the corresponding drug effects, the
two diseases have more possibility to be drug-repositioned than
other diseases (Fig. 8b).

In addition, utilization of clinical data itself could be an ad-
vantage in drug research ﬁeld. Other conventional approaches
for drug repositioning, such as target-based approach (Keiser
et al., 2009) and effect-based approach (Sirota et al., 2011),
have the same limitation that is the translational problem,
which means that a drug does not work in clinical trials even
though it works well in an in vitro or a mouse experiment. This
study, however, can complement the translational problem be-
cause clinical data were directly used for calculating disease as-
sociations and inferring drug repositioning candidate diseases.

5 DISCUSSION

We further explored disease pairs that are able to be new candi-
dates for drug repositioning. As a result, we found that the gout
and heart diseases pairs were positioned at high ranks in this

study, but drugs hardly shared for the disease pairs yet
(Table 1). To verify the potential for new candidates of drug
repositioning, we investigated relationships between gout and
heart diseases from literature, and we could obtain some evi-
dence that they are closely associated. Choi and Curhan (2007)
and De Vera et al. (2010) claimed that men and women with gout
have an increased risk for heart diseases, such as myocardial
infarction and coronary heart disease. Moreover, Krishnan
et al. (2006) also revealed that gout is a risk factor of myocardial
infarction, using multivariable regression models. In Krishnan’s
article, they referred that further research will be needed for the
exact links between two diseases, and the combinatorial ap-
proach of this study could give some clues for it.

We also disclosed disease pairs of cataract and heart diseases
that has great potential for new drug repositioning candidates
(Table 1). To understand the results further, we surveyed articles
that support the observed disease association. Theodoropoulou
et al. (2011) reported that coronary heart disease is one of the
statistically signiﬁcant risk factor of cataract. In addition,
Younan et al. (2003) provided some evidence supporting a rela-
tionship between cardiovascular diseases and incident cataract.

6 CONCLUSION

The combinatorial approach is highly necessary to explain dis-
ease associations because the real diseases occur in combinatorial
ways. In this study, we inferred disease associations with a novel
approach that considered disease-related physiological factors in
combinatorial ways by using NHANES data. This study will give
good explanations for understanding disease associations, and it
will also provide inspiration to combinatorial approach studies
not only in the disease related ﬁeld but also in other ﬁelds having
combinatorial characteristic. Furthermore, we generated disease
speciﬁc CLACOPs as well as CRACOMs, which will give a few
clues for disease prevention and etiology. Those proﬁles will be
investigated in the future.

Note: Four disease pairs in this table have been revealed as candidates for drug
repositioning. Those pairs had relatively high similarities in this study but relatively
low similarities in the reference DN, indicating that they have not been used for
drug 55 repositioning yet in spite of the potential. CHF: congestive heart failure,
CHD: coronary heart disease.

We also validated the potential of this study to be used in the
drug repositioning ﬁeld, and showed that this study outper-
formed other approaches in this regard. As a result, a few disease
pairs such as the gout and congestive heart failure, and the cata-
ract and coronary heart disease, were suggested as the candidate
diseases for drug repositioning.

We will investigate these drug repositioning candidate diseases
on hereafter studies. In addition, when molecular data and their
combinatorial analysis are incorporated, further improvements
could be achieved in elucidating disease associations because mo-
lecular data provide the information that physiological data
cannot cover. This further work also will be investigated in the
future.

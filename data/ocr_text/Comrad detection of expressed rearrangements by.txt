ABSTRACT

Motivation: Comrad is a novel algorithmic framework for the
integrated analysis of RNA-Seq and whole genome shotgun
sequencing (WGSS) data for the purposes of discovering genomic
rearrangements and aberrant transcripts. The Comrad framework
leverages the advantages of both RNA-Seq and WGSS data,
providing accurate classification of rearrangements as expressed or
not expressed and accurate classification of the genomic or non-
genomic origin of aberrant transcripts. A major benefit of Comrad is
its ability to accurately identify aberrant transcripts and associated
rearrangements using low coverage genome data. As a result, a
Comrad analysis can be performed at a cost comparable to that
of two RNA-Seq experiments, significantly lower than an analysis
requiring high coverage genome data.

Results: We have applied Comrad to the discovery of gene fusions
and read-throughs in prostate cancer cell line C4-2, a derivative of
the LNCaP cell line with androgen-independent characteristics. As
a proof of concept, we have rediscovered in the 04-2 data 4 of
the 6 fusions previously identified in LNCaP. We also identified six
novel fusion transcripts and associated genomic breakpoints, and
verified their existence in LNCaP, suggesting that Comrad may be
more sensitive than previous methods that have been applied to
fusion discovery in LNCaP. We show that many of the gene fusions
discovered using Comrad would be difficult to identify using currently
available techniques.

1 INTRODUCTION

High-throughput sequencing of cDNA (RNA-Seq) is rapidly
accelerating our understanding of the sequence content of the
human transcriptome. RNA-Seq can be used for high-throughput

quantiﬁcation of transcript abundance as has been done previously
using microarrays. However, microarray-based approaches require
pre—existing knowledge of the transcriptome sequence. RNA-Seq,
in contrast, can be used for de novo characterization of the
transcriptome including unbiased discovery and nucleotide level
characterization of novel transcripts. Compared to previous, Sanger
sequencing-based approaches for discovering novel transcripts,
RNA—Seq is higher throughput for lower cost (Wang et al., 2009).

Applied to cancer genomics, RNA-Seq can be employed for
the discovery of novel aberrant transcripts with implications for
cancer biology. Maher et al. (2009a, b) used RNA-Seq to rediscover
known gene fusions in chronic myelogenous leukaemia (CML) and
prostate cell lines, and also discovered novel gene fusions in prostate
tumours. Similarly, Berger et al. (2010) applied RNA-Seq to the
discovery of gene fusions in melanoma. Pﬂueger et al. (2011) used
a newly developed method called FusionSeq (Sboner et al. , 2010) to
discover gene fusions in RNA-Seq data from prostate tumours, and
Hu et al. (2010) developed PERAlign and used it to discover gene
fusions in breast cancer cell lines. The general methodology used by
all of these studies was the ‘paired end’ method: (i) RNA-Seq is used
to sequence both ends of a set of cDNA fragments; (ii) the resulting
sequence pairs are aligned to the reference genome or transcriptome;
(iii) a chimeric transcript will produce chimeric fragments and those
chimeric fragments will produce a pair of sequences (paired end
reads) that align to different genes, thus, any paired end read for
which one end aligns to one gene and the other end aligns to another
gene is considered potential evidence of a gene fusion.

Despite the aforementioned methodological advances and
associated discoveries, accurate prediction of gene fusions from
RNA-Seq data remains a difﬁcult problem. The large amount of
sequence data produced by high-throughput sequencing and the
complexity of the transcriptome make RNA-Seq data difﬁcult to
interpret. High expression levels combined with sequencing errors
and novel splicing produce many sequence pairs that appear to
have been produced from chimeric fragments (Sboner et al., 2010).
Furthermore, the reverse transcription step used to produce cDNA
has been shown to produce chimeric fragments Via the process of
template switching (Houseley and Tollervey, 2010). Previous studies
dealt with false positives produced by ‘false’ chimeric fragments
with the application of heuristic ﬁlters (Berger et al., 2010; Maher
et al., 2009a, b; Pﬂueger et al., 2011; Sboner et al., 2010). Another
common practise was to discard paired end reads with multiple

mappings to the genome (multi-map reads) (Berger et al., 2010;
Maher et al., 2009a, b; Pﬂueger et al., 2011; Sboner et al., 2010).
Although discarding multi-map reads and applying heuristic ﬁlters
may reduce the false positive rate, the effects of these practises on
the false negative rate have not been properly quantiﬁed.

Assuming successful prediction of fusion transcripts from
RNA-Seq data, the signiﬁcance of those transcripts may still
depend on the discovery of an underlying genomic rearrangement.
Fusions between adjacent genes not associated with a genomic
rearrangements are a distinct class of fusion transcript known as
transcription-induced chimeras (TICs) or read-throughs. Though a
signiﬁcant amount of recent work has identiﬁed tissue and tumour-
speciﬁc read-throughs (Brooks et al., 2009; Kato et al., 2003;
Rickman et al., 2009; Wang et al., 2007), the mechanisms for
their heritability remain unclear, and their ubiquity in normal tissue
(Akiva et al., 2006; Parra et al., 2006) impedes assessment of their
functional signiﬁcance in cancer. RNA-Seq alone cannot distinguish
a read-through from a small deletion that brings together two genes.
Instead of RNA-Seq, some investigators have sought to discover
gene fusions using whole genome shotgun sequencing (WGSS)
(Bashir et al., 2008; Pleasance et al., 2010). However, results
produced from WGSS data suffer from the reverse problem, that
is, the signiﬁcance of any fusion discovered using WGSS data
is difﬁcult to determine without an understanding of its effects
on expression and without knowing whether it produces a fusion
transcript. Furthermore, the unfocused nature of whole genome
sequencing make this method expensive at coverage levels required
to accurately predict genomic rearrangements.

A natural progression, given the complementarity of genomic
and transcriptomic data, would be an analysis that combine these
two data types. For example, the study by Berger et al. (2010)
combined RNA-Seq data with copy number data to identify gene
fusions associated with deletions and unbalanced rearrangements.
Unfortunately, copy number data is ineffective for the discovery of
balanced rearrangements such as the reciprocal translocation that
creates the BCR—ABL gene fusion associated with CML (Rowley,
1973). In contrast, WGSS data can effectively discover balanced
and unbalanced rearrangements. However, there are currently no
methods that combine whole genome sequence data with RNA-Seq
data for the purposes of gene fusion detection.

The availability of methods for predicting gene fusions in RNA—
Seq data and rearrangements in WGSS data make it conceivable
that these existing methods could be combined for a joint analysis
of RNA-Seq and WGSS data for accurate gene fusion prediction.
However, as we demonstrate in this article, applying each tool
independently and then combining the results would be inaccurate.
All methods for analysis of either RNA-Seq or WGSS data use
heuristic ﬁlters to discard low conﬁdence predictions supported by
marginal amounts of evidence in order to attain a reasonable true
positive rate. Thus, any true fusion supported by only a marginal
amount of evidence in either one or both datasets will be missed
by independent analysis. We ﬁnd that a joint analysis produces
a limited number of results supported by both datasets, partially
obviating the need for thresholding when searching for aberrant
transcripts associated with genomic rearrangements. Similarly, the
actual mapping location of multi-map reads may be difﬁcult to
resolve with an independent analysis of each dataset, even when
using methods that effectively leverage multi-map reads, such as
MoDIL (Lee et al., 2009) or VariationHunter (Hajirasouliha et al.,

2010; Hormozdiari et al., 2009, 2010) for WGSS analysis, and
deFuse (McPherson et al., 2011) or ShortFuse (Kinsella et al., 2011)
for RNA-Seq analysis. We show that an analysis that simultaneously
considers all reads from both datasets is better able to resolve the
alignment location of multi-map reads.

2 APPROACH

Comrad is a novel algorithmic framework for the integrated
analysis of RNA-Seq and WGSS data for the purposes of
discovering genomic rearrangements and aberrant transcripts.
Comrad builds on the COMMON-LAW framework ﬁrst proposed
in related work by Hormozdiari et al. (2011) on structural variation
discovery in multiple sequenced genomes. The Comrad method
leverages the advantages of both types of data, providing accurate
classiﬁcation of rearrangements as expressed or not expressed and
accurate classiﬁcation of the genomic or non—genomic origin of
aberrant transcripts. A major beneﬁt of Comrad is its ability to
accurately predict fusion transcripts and their associated genome
rearrangements using low coverage WGSS data. As a result, a
Comrad analysis can be performed at a cost comparable to that
of two RNA-Seq experiments, signiﬁcantly lower than an analysis
requiring high coverage genome data. The algorithmic basis of
Comrad, provided in detail in this article, is an integer programming
formulation which can be solved exactly using branch and bound or
approximately using the relaxation of the linear program. For larger
datasets, Comrad provides the option of using a greedy algorithm
that can yield efﬁcient solutions with reasonable running times.

We have applied Comrad to the discovery of gene fusions and
read-throughs in prostate cancer cell line C4—2, a derivative of
the LNCaP cell line with androgen-independent characteristics.
As proof of concept, we have used Comrad to rediscover 4 out
of 5 fusions previously described in LNCaP and known to also
exist in C4—2. We have also used Comrad to identify six novel
fusion transcripts and associated genomic rearrangements. A simple
extension to the Comrad framework has allowed us to discover
reciprocal rearrangement breakpoints for the two translocations
found in the C4-2 data, making Comrad the ﬁrst method to
allow for the systematic discovery of reciprocal rearrangements.
Furthermore, since Comrad is not biased towards canonical fusion
splice junctions or fusions between known exons, we are able to
use Comrad to discover fusions exhibiting non—canonical splicing.
Some of the fusions we identify are supported by multi-map reads,
showing that Comrad can effectively leverage multi-map reads for
fusion discovery. Finally, some of the rearrangement breakpoints
discovered by Comrad have as few as one read of supporting
evidence, showing that Comrad is effective at discovering fusion
evidence in low coverage genome data.

3 METHODS

The Comrad method begins by enumerating all rearrangement breakpoints
implied by the WGSS reads and all gene fusion splices implied by the RNA-
Seq reads. Some of these breakpoints and fusion splices will be supported
by multi-map reads, but a read can only originate from at most one genomic
location. Thus, we require a robust method for determining the most likely
origin for each read given the greater context of the alignments of all WGSS
and RNA-Seq reads. Most rearrangements and gene fusions are speciﬁc to
individual cell lineages, i.e. they occur at low levels of recurrence (Mitelman
et al., 2007). Furthermore, since the RNA-Seq and WGSS data originate

Connad

 

from the same sample, fundamental differences between the two datasets
(differences that are not the result of expression or splicing) are unlikely.
Thus, when seeking to determine the most likely origin for each read, we
seek as the most parsimonious solution, a global assignment (of reads) that
minimizes three types of differences: differences between the WGSS dataset
and the reference genome (rearrangement breakpoints), differences between
the RNA-Seq dataset and the reference transcriptome (fusion splices) and
differences between RNA-Seq dataset and WGSS dataset.

3.1 Identifying potential rearrangement breakpoints
and fusion splices

Analysis of the WGSS data begins by enumerating all rearrangement
breakpoints implied by the WGSS reads, and forming clusters of WGSS
reads that support each rearrangement breakpoint. WGSS reads are aligned to
the genome (NCBI36). Concordantly, aligning reads are used to estimate the
minimum and maximum DNA fragment length Lmin and [max (Berger et al.,
2010; Maher et al., 2009a), and are subsequently discarded. All alignments of
the remaining discordant reads are retained for further analysis. We then use
an existing algorithm (Hormozdiari et al., 2009; McPherson et al., 2011) to
identify all clusters of discordant alignments, where each cluster is a maximal
set of reads that could be explained by a single pair of breakpoints.

Similar to the analysis of the WGSS data, analysis of the RNA-Seq data
begins by enumerating all fusion splices implied by the RNA-Seq reads,
and forming clusters of RNA-Seq reads that support each fusion splice.
RNA-Seq reads are aligned to spliced transcript sequences and unspliced
gene sequences as annotated by ensembl (version 54) (Bengtsson et al.,
2008). Aligning to all splice variants of each gene and also the unspliced
gene sequence enables Comrad to handle alternative splicing in a natural
way. Multiple alignments of RNA-Seq data will arise because of homology
between genes and redundant inclusion of the same exon in multiple splice
variants of the same gene. Selecting the most parsimonious set of unique
alignments for RNA-Seq data, as described later, will select not only the
most likely pair of genes involved in a fusion event, but also the most
likely pair of splice variants for each gene. Maximal sets of discordant
RNA-Seq alignments corroborating the same fusion splice are enumerated
using analogous conditions and the same algorithm as described for WGSS
alignments.

3.2 Corroborating rearrangement breakpoints and
fusion splices

RNA-Seq and WGSS alignments corroborate the same rearrangement if there
exists at least one plausible genomic breakpoint at each locus that could
explain both the RNA-Seq and WGSS alignments. Splicing confounds this
problem because it often results in RNA-Seq reads that align to the genome
many kilobases from the corresponding rearrangement breakpoints. Thus,
to accurately establish corroboration between RNA-Seq and WGSS data,
the effects of splicing must be considered. We describe two conditions for
corroboration that afford efﬁcient computation and ensure the existence of
rearrangement breakpoints that would explain the RNA-Seq and genome
sequencing alignments.

From one end of a given set of RNA-Seq alignments, we deﬁne the
projected intron as the [max sized region starting at the most downstream
genomic position of those alignments (Fig. 1). A set of RNA-Seq alignments
is said to be corroborated by a set of WGSS alignments if the projected
introns for the RNA-Seq alignments overlap with the breakpoint regions
for the WGSS alignments. Thus, the overlapping intron condition is the
condition that the pair of projected introns for RNA-Seq alignments must
overlap with the pairs of breakpoint regions for the WGSS alignments.

We also deﬁne the intron region as the portion of the projected intron
of a set of RNA-Seq alignments that is upstream from and including the
breakpoint regions of a set of WGSS alignments (Fig. 1). The non-conﬂicting
intron condition is the condition that the two intron regions for a potentially
corroborating set of RNA-Seq and WGSS alignments cannot overlap. The

non-conﬂicting intron condition disqualiﬁes mutually exclusive sets of RNA-
Seq and genome sequencing alignments that would otherwise satisfy the
overlapping intron condition.

3.3 Selecting the most parsimonious set of alignments
for ambiguously aligning reads

The relationship between WGSS reads, rearrangement breakpoints, RNA-
Seq reads and fusion splices can be depicted in the rearrangement support
graph as shown in Figure 2. The rearrangement support graph is formed by
connecting WGSS reads to rearrangement breakpoints supported by those
reads, and connecting RNA-Seq reads to fusion splices supported by those
reads. Fusion splices and rearrangements breakpoints are connected based
on the corroboration indicated by the overlapping intron condition and the
non-conﬂicting intron condition.

The rearrangement support graph encodes the ambiguity of WGSS and
RNA-Seq reads with multiple alignments. Since at most one alignment for
each read is valid, we seek a transformation of the graph that removes edges
such that the transformed graph has exactly one edge incident with each
read. Given only RNA-Seq data, we previously attempted to produce a
maximum parsimony solution with a minimum number of predicted fusions
(McPherson et al., 2011). More recently, we introduced combinatorial
formulations to identify structural variation events in several donor genomes
by means of minimizing a weighted sum of structural differences between the
donor genomes as well as one reference genome (Hormozdiari et al., 2011).
Expanding on this principle, we now attempt to select a set of alignments

M so as to minimize the number of differences between the WGSS data,
RNA-Seq data and the reference genome.

Let X g be the set of all rearrangement breakpoints and let X T be the set of
all fusion splices. Let CgT be the set of all rearrangement breakpoint/fusion
splice pairs (xjg ,x?) e X g x X T that satisfy both conditions of corroboration.

For each rearrangement breakpoint ng eXg, let 6]? 6 Ag be a corresponding

indicator variable, such that 6? :1 if and only if at least one alignment

has been selected that supports x19. In other words, 6? :1 if and only if
the corresponding rearrangement breakpoint vertex has at least one incident
alignment edge in the transformed graph. Deﬁne fusion splice indicator
variables, 6,? 6 AT, similarly.

We are now in a position to give precise deﬁnitions of the three types of
differences being considered. For a given set of selected alignments, each
ng e X g for which 619 = 1 implies a single difference between the WGSS data
and the reference. Similarly, each x]?- EXT for which 6]?- = 1 implies a single
difference between the RNA-Seq data and the reference. Fully enumerating
the differences between the WGSS data and the RNA-Seq data would require
assembly of at least one of these datasets, a method we do not consider here.
Instead, we deﬁne a difference between the WGSS data and the RNA-Seq
data as a difference found between one dataset and the reference that is not
corroborated by a difference between the other dataset and the reference.

First deﬁne a corroboration indicator variable K19 for each rearrangement

breakpoint ng that indicates whether a fusion splice has been selected that

corroborates x19. More formally, 1ch = 1 if and only if there exists (xjg ,x[) E

CgT for which 62- : 1. Deﬁne a similar indicator variable K[ for each
fusion splice xi? A difference between the WGSS data and the reference not
corroborated by a difference between the RNA-Seq data and the reference
is given by 6]? -(1—chg). Conversely, an uncorroborated difference between
the RNA-Seq data and the reference is given by 6,3- - (1 — 193-).

Let A be the full set of alignments considered and let M E A be any valid
subset, that is, a set of alignments for which each read is aligned to exactly
one mapping location. We seek to minimize the objective function f (M)
that calculates the total number of differences implied by M [Equation (1)].

f(M) = Zajg+ZaZ+Zaf-(1—K,9)+ZaZ-<1—x[)
J' k j k

= X12519—6f-x19]+2[26[—6[-K[] (1)
j k

We seek an efﬁcient algorithm that minimizes this objective function by
reducing the rearrangement support graph. We propose two algorithms for
solving this problem, an ILP formulation for use with an ILP solver and an
approximation algorithm based on weighted set cover.

3.3.1 ILP formulation For each RNA-Seq read rig 6x19, a 0-1 integer
variable a? indicates whether the edge between rig and ng is present in the
transformed graph. Similarly, 0-1 integer variable all represents whether
the edge between rlT and x]?- is present in the transformed graph. The ILP
formulation for reducing the rearrangement support graph attempts to ﬁnd
a valid assignment for variables at? and all that minimizes the objective
function given in Equation (1). As described above, 0-1 integer variables 6?
and 6,?- represent whether at least one read has been assigned to the respective
rearrangement breakpoint ng and fusion splice xz. Let ng = 6? - K19 and z]?- =
SZ-JCZ- Also, let cjk = 1 if (xjg ,x[) e CgT, otherwise cJ-k = 0. The objective
function for the ILP is given as in Equation (1), and the constraints are given
below in Equations (2)—(9).

Constraints 2 and 3 ensure that each read is assigned to exactly one
cluster in the transformed graph. Constraints 4 and 5 ensure that a cluster is
considered as selected if at least one read has been assigned to that cluster.
The constraint given by Equation (6) ensures that ng :1 only if 619:1, a

consequence of deﬁning ng 2819-199. The constraint given by Equation (8)
ensures that ng :1 only if there exists a k such that 62-21 and cJ-k :1,

that is, zg :1 for rearrangement breakpoint j only if a corroborating fusion
splice has been selected. The constraints given by Equations (7) and (9) are
analogous constraints for z[.

The above ILP formulation can be solved exactly using an ILP solver
or can be solved approximately using randomized rounding applied to the
LP relaxation of the problem. For the purposes of this study, we used the
branch and bound-based exact ILP solver provided in the GLPK library
(http://www.gnu.org/software/glpk/).

3.3.2 Greedy approximation algorithms The greedy approximation
algorithm for reducing the rearrangement support graph can be used to
provide an approximate solution to larger problems. The algorithm is based
on a previous formulation for identifying structural variations in multiple
genomes as proposed by Hormozdiari et al. (2011). However, we rework
the cost function to allow a single rearrangement breakpoint to support
multiple fusion splices and Visa versa. For each corroborating rearrangement
breakpoint/fusion splice pair (xjg ,x[) e C QT, form the read set z =ng ng-
and an associated indicator set Az={6.g,6,Z-}. For each uncorroborated
rearrangement breakpoint ng form the set z =ng and an associated indicator

set AZ 2 {SJ-g}. Form analogous sets for uncorroborated transcriptome
clusters. Calculate the cost of each set z as given in Equation (10).

cost(z) = 2— Z 5,, (10)

ameAz

Let U be the set of uncovered reads, initially empty. Also, all 6? and 6,3- are
initially 0. At each step in the algorithm, select the set zk that covers the largest
number of reads for the lowest cost, that is, the set zk that maximizes 11.

IZk \ U | (11)
cost(Zk)

For each 6m 6 AZk, set 6m :1 if |xm \ U | > 0. That is, select cluster xm by
setting 6m :1 if xm covers additional elements of U. Update all other AZ
that contain 6m and also update the cost of any set that may have changed
due to changes in its associated AZ. For each read r in zk\U, remove all
edges in the rearrangement support graph incident with r, retaining only the
edge between r and the cluster used to create zk. Add the reads in zk to U,
and repeat, selecting a new set zk+1 until U includes all WGSS and RNA-
Seq reads. The greedy algorithm will provide a solution with cost at most
logn-OPT, where OPT is the cost of the optimal solution and n is the total
number of reads. For asymptotic analysis and proofs of complexity, please
see Hormozdiari et al. (2011).

 

3.4 Modifying the breakpoint overlap function

One beneﬁt of the given formulation of the problem is that it allows for the
substitution of different rules for the corroborative relationship (xjg,x,z-) e

CgT. We explored one other possibility. Given a rearrangement breakpoint

ng and a fusion splice x21 we calculate the pair of genes potentially

affected by the events represented by these clusters. We then deﬁne C QT as
(xjg ,x[) E C QT <=> genepair(xjg) = genepair(x,Z-). We show in the Section
4 that this alternative corroborative relationship allows us to discover
reciprocal translocations.

3.5 Assembling a prediction sequence

For each fusion splice and each rearrangement breakpoint, Comrad
assembles a prediction sequence. Suppose a set of reads implies a fusion
splice (or rearrangement breakpoint) between transcriptA and B (or genomic
loci A and B). Let {(s’l?‘,e’i“)} and {(s?,e?)} be the start and end positions
for the alignments to A and B, respectively. Let SA be the sequence in A
in the range [min{s’l.“},max{e’i“}], and let SB be the sequence in B in the
range [min{s?},max{e?}]. If the alignments are to the + strand of gene A
and the — strand of gene B (+— orientation), then the prediction sequence
is SA-SB. For —+, ++ and —— orientations, the predicted sequence is
rc(SA)-rc(SB), SA -rc(SB) and rc(SA)-SB, respectively, where rc() is reverse
complementation.

3.6 Heuristic ﬁltering

The heuristic ﬁltering used by Comrad can be categorized as pre-ﬁltering
or post-ﬁltering. Pre-ﬁltering is applied before the application of the above
algorithms, and is intended to remove reads that are unlikely to inform a gene
fusion analysis. Post-ﬁltering is applied to the results of the above algorithms
in an attempt to remove predictions that are likely to be false positives or are
unlikely to be novel.

3.6.1 Pre-ﬁltering The pre-ﬁltering used by Comrad involves aligning
reads to a speciﬁc set of sequences using bowtie (Langmead et al., 2009) and
removing those reads from further consideration if their alignments satisfy
a given criteria. RNA-Seq reads are aligned to the genome and UniGene
clusters (Sayers et al., 2011) and reads with concordant alignments are
discarded. RNA-Seq data are often contaminated by a signiﬁcant amount
of ribosomal RNA (rRNA) (Sboner et al., 2010). Thus, RNA-Seq reads are
also aligned to ensembl annotated rRNA, and any read with one or both ends
aligning to any rRNA is discarded. Comrad is not intended as a method for
reconstructing immunoglobulin (IG) rearrangements. Thus, any RNA-Seq
read that aligns with one end to one IG gene, and the other end to any other
IG gene is discarded. Finally, Comrad discards RNA-Seq and WGSS reads
for which each end aligns to a repeat region in the genome, and those repeat
regions are of the same type.

3.6.2 False positive post-ﬁltering False positive post-ﬁltering attempts to
remove predictions that are most likely to be false positives produced by
spurious alignment artifacts. The sequence concordance ﬁlter aligns each
prediction sequence to the appropriate reference sequences using blat (Kent,
2002). Fusion splices are aligned to spliced and unspliced gene sequences and
rearrangement breakpoints are aligned to the genome. A prediction sequence
is discarded if that sequence aligns to the reference with >80% identity. The
read concordance ﬁlter uses blat to align all reads suggestive of an event to
the appropriate reference (see above). A prediction is discarded if >10% of
the supporting reads align concordantly to that reference. Genomic fusions
require at least one supporting WGSS read and ﬁve supporting RNA-Seq
reads to be considered in this study.

3.6.3 Novelty post-ﬁltering Novelty post-ﬁltering attempts to remove
predictions that are unlikely to be novel. The sequence concordance ﬁlter
is used to remove fusion splice predictions with signiﬁcant alignments to
ESTs [EST database retrieved from UCSC genome browser (Rhead et al.,
2010) November 26, 2010]. The EST island ﬁlter begins by aligning fusion
splice prediction sequences to the genome using blat and allowing for a
spliced alignment. Fusion splices are discarded if their prediction sequence

aligns entirely within a region of the genome suggested as co-transcribed by
clusters of overlapping spliced EST alignments (Rhead et al., 2010).

4 RESULTS

We analyzed RNA-Seq and WGSS data produced from the C4-2
cell line, a derivative of the LNCaP prostate cell line. As a result of
the close relationship between C4-2 and LNCaP, we hypothesized
that fusions previously discovered in LNCaP would be useful as
positive controls to be searched for in the C4—2 data. We also sought
to use the C4-2 data as a proxy for discovering novel gene fusions
in LNCaP. The WGSS and RNA-Seq data for C4-2 each consisted
of 84 million 50 bp + 50 bp paired end reads. With an approximate
fragment length of 500 bp, the WGSS data provide 7x physical
coverage of a diploid human genome. Given that the LNCaP genome
is tetraploid (Beheshti et al., 2000), the physical coverage for C4-2
is more likely closer to 3.5 x.

Previous analysis of LNCaP resulted in the discovery of
six fusion transcripts (Maher et al., 2009a, b), DLEU2—PSPC1,
RERE—PIK3CD, MIPOLl—DGKB, MRPS 10—HPR, C190rf25—APC2
and SLC45A3-ELK4. We used PCR to conﬁrm ﬁve of these
fusion transcripts as present in C4—2; DLEU2-PSPC1 could not
be conﬁrmed in C4—2. The ﬁve conﬁrmed fusion transcripts
serve as positive control fusion transcripts to be discovered by
Comrad in the C4-2 data. Both C190rf25-APC2 and SLC45A3-
ELK4 involve adjacent genes, and are thus potential read-through
events, a possibility that was conﬁrmed for SLC45A3—ELK4
in a more recent study (Rickman et al., 2009). Comrad found
only RNA-Seq evidence of SLC45A3—ELK4 in C4—2, providing
further evidence that SLC45A3-ELK4 is not associated with
chromosomal rearrangement. N0 RNA-Seq or WGSS evidence was
found for C190rf25-APC2. A targeted search did not identify any
RNA-Seq reads supporting a C190rf25-APC2 fusion transcript,
suggesting that C190rf25-APC2 expression is lower than that
required for detection at the sequencing depth provided by the C4-
2 RNA-Seq data. The remaining three fusions, RERE—PIK3CD,
MIPOL1—DGKB and MRPSlO—HPR involve distant genes and
are thus potentially caused by underlying genomic rearrangement.
Comrad successfully identiﬁed the previously described (Tomlins
et al., 2007) rearrangement breakpoint for MIPOL1—DGKB and
also identiﬁed rearrangement breakpoints for RERE—PIK3CD and
MRPSlO—HPR. The novel rearrangement breakpoints for RERE-
PIK3CD and MRPS 10-HPR were conﬁrmed by PCR for both C4—2
and LNCaP.

Comrad predicted an additional 10 novel genomic fusions for
C4—2 (Supplementary Table Sl). We attempted to validate 9 of
the 10 predictions, excluding AMACR-GUSBLl as a likely read-
through associated with a small 600 bp deletion. Of the nine novel
Comrad predictions, six were validated in C4-2 by PCR and sanger
sequencing. We also validated all six novel Comrad predictions
in LNCaP, thereby showing that Comrad is more sensitive than
previous methods that have been applied to fusion discovery in
LNCaP. Evidence for the six previously identiﬁed fusion transcripts
and the six novel Comrad predictions is shown in Table 1.

To identify potential false negatives, we also analyzed the C4-2
RNA-Seq data using deFuse, a method for identifying fusion
transcripts in RNA-Seq data alone. The deFuse analysis produced
31 predictions, 8 of which are predicted to be interchromosomal
or long—range intrachromosomal fusions (Supplementary Table S4).

The number of reads supporting each event is provided, in addition to how many of those
reads multi-map to the genome. The ﬁrst six fusions have been previously described.

Genomic evidence was identiﬁed by Comrad for 7 of these 8
fusions; genomic evidence for the singe remaining fusion transcript,
ZDHHC20-TNFRSF19, could not be identiﬁed by Comrad. The
predicted ZDHHC20—TNFRSF19 sequence exhibits canonical GT—
AG splicing at the fusion boundary and is thus not likely to
be the product of template switching during reverse transcriptase
(Houseley and Tollervey, 2010). The lack of genomic evidence for
ZDHHC20-TNFRSF19 makes this fusion a candidate trans-splicing
event in C4—2 (Li et al. , 2008). Alternatively, ZDHHC20—TNFRSF19
could represent a false negative for Comrad.

4.1 Accurate discovery of gene fusions

Analysis of WGSS data for evidence of genomic rearrangement
is made difﬁcult by the repetitive nature of the genome, and the
large amount of coverage required to reliably predict rearrangements
(Chen et al., 2009; Hormozdiari et al., 2009). Conversely, RNA-Seq
produces many spurious chimeric reads by at least two mechanisms:
template switching during reverse transcriptase (Houseley and
Tollervey, 2010) and the combined effect of read errors and high
gene expression (Sboner et al., 2010). Given RNA-Seq and WGSS
data from the same sample, an integrated analysis using Comrad
provides the ability to more accurately resolve multi-map reads,
and more conﬁdently identify real events even where those events
have relatively little evidence.

Comrad accurately identiﬁes WGSS evidence for gene fusions,
even when the evidence consists of only a small number of reads.
Five of the validated genomic breakpoints are supported by two or
less WGSS reads (Table 1). The breakpoint for DGKB—MIPOLl,
arguably the most biologically important fusion in the dataset, is
supported by one read. An independent analysis of WGSS data using
a threshold of one read would result in the prediction of 20 675
fusions between the genes considered in this study. Considering
only uniquely aligned reads results in the prediction of 9949 fusions
supported by at least one WGSS read.

The existence of 9949 fusions would indicate that C4-2 is very
highly rearranged, especially since these 9949 fusions represent
rearrangements involving genic regions only. However, aCGH data
does not indicate this level of genomic rearrangement as only
41 copy number change points are predicted across the genome
(Supplementary Table SS). Additionally, previous spectral karyotype
results identiﬁed only nine structural aberrations (per diploid cell)
for LNCaP (Beheshti et al., 2000). Thus, it is likely that many of
the 9949 fusions are either false positives or represent transposable
elements as opposed to large-scale structural aberrations. Clearly,
identiﬁcation of true positives from this set of fusions would be
difﬁcult if not impossible, rendering a single discordant WGSS read
unreliable in an independent analysis of WGSS data. However,
that single discordant WGSS read could be used to identify an
important rearrangement breakpoint when considered in conjunction
with RNA-Seq data as is done by Comrad.

Comrad provides the ability to accurately identify fusions where
evidence for those fusions does not map uniquely to the genome.
For the 9 PCR conﬁrmed genomic fusions, 38% of the RNA-Seq
reads and 32% of the WGSS reads are multi-map reads. Removing
these reads from the analysis would prevent the identiﬁcation of
the MRPS 10—HPR and TFDP1—GRK1 fusion transcripts and would
hinder our ability to properly identify the CYP2C19—FAM190B
fusion transcript (14/20 multi-map reads) and both the forward and
reciprocal rearrangement breakpoints for MRPS 10—HPR (12/13 and
4/5 multi-map reads, respectively). The MRPS 10—HPR and TFDP1—
GRKl fusion transcripts are supported entirely by multi-map RNA-
Seq reads. Intron 2 of WDR32 contains a region of high sequence
similarity to parts of MRPSlO. As a result, the RNA-Seq evidence
for MRPSlO—HPR aligns to either a hypothetical WDR32—HPR
fusion transcript or the MRPSlO—HPR fusion transcript. Similarly,
RNA-Seq evidence for TFDP1-GRK1 also supports a hypothetical
BX842568-GRK1 fusion transcript. TFDP1 and BX842568 have
96% sequence similarity over a region of 1234 bp, making the two
possibilities, TFDP1—GRK1 or BX842568—GRK1, equally likely
without knowledge of the corroborating WGSS data identiﬁed by
Comrad. Therefore, even an analysis of the RNA-Seq data using
a method that considers multi-map reads could fail to correctly
identify the MRPSlO—HPR and TFDP1—GRK1 fusion transcripts.
However, Comrad is able to resolve the correct alignment location of
multi-map reads that support the MRPS 10—HPR and TFDP1—GRK1
fusion transcripts by leveraging the relatively unambiguous WGSS
evidence of associated rearrangement breakpoints.

4.2 MIPOLl-DGKB and MRPSlO-HPR are caused by
reciprocal exchanges in C4-2 and LNCaP

In order to search for multiple genomic breakpoints associated with
gene fusions, we altered the breakpoint overlap function as described

in Section 3.4. The MIPOL1—DGKB and MRPSlO-HPR fusions
were both found to have reciprocal rearrangement breakpoints in
addition to the regular breakpoints that produce the MIPOL1—DGKB
and MRPSlO—HPR fusion transcripts. The reciprocal breakpoints
were each positioned no further than 10 kb from the regular
breakpoints, and were oriented so as to create reciprocal DGKB-
MIPOL1 and HPR—MRPSlO fusion genes. Comrad did not detect
a fusion transcript for either of the reciprocal DGKB—MIPOL1
and HPR—MRPSlO fusion genes. The presence of the reciprocal
rearrangement breakpoints was conﬁrmed by PCR for both C4-2
and LNCaP.

The regular and reciprocal breakpoints involving the MRPSlO
gene at p21.1 on chromosome 6 and the HPR at q22.3
on chromosome 16 are almost certain to represent the
t(6;16)(p21.1;q22) reciprocal translocation previously identiﬁed
by spectral karyotyping of LNCaP (Beheshti et al., 2000). The
same spectral karyotype for LNCaP does not identify a reciprocal
translocation between chromosomes 7 and 14 that would be
necessary to explain the regular and reciprocal breakpoints identiﬁed
for DGKB—MIPOL1. Extensive ﬂuorescent in situ hybridization
(FISH) experiments performed by Tomlins et al. (2007) also rule
out the possibility of 7-14 reciprocal translocation, and instead
Tomlins et al. hypothesize that the DGKB-MIPOL1 fusion is the
result of an insertion. The new reciprocal breakpoint evidence
identiﬁed by Comrad and validated by PCR strongly indicate that
the DGKB—MIPOL1 fusion is not the result of a simple insertion.
Given the previous spectral karyotype and FISH evidence, and the
newly identiﬁed reciprocal breakpoint, a more likely hypothesis
is that the DGKB-MIPOL1 fusion is caused by an underlying
reciprocal insertion, by which genomic DNA is exchanged between
chromosome 7 and chromosome 14 to produce DGKB-MIPOL1 and
the reciprocal MIPOL1—DGKB (Fig. 3).

4.3 Genomic rearrangements create fusion transcripts
with non-canonical splicing

The Comrad predictions include three validated fusion transcripts
with non—canonical splicing in C4-2. The three transcripts predicted
for the PIK3CD—RERE fusion include one for which an intronic
region of RERE is not spliced out of the resulting transcript.
The MRPSlO—HPR fusion activates a cryptic splice site in the 3’

full sequence of the genomic breakpoint, as no splicing occurs
across the breakpoint. By analyzing the exon and intron expression
obtained from RNA-Seq alignments, it is apparent that a signiﬁcant
proportion of CCDC43-YBX2 expression includes the ﬁrst half
of intron 3 of CCDC43 and the last half of intron 4 of YBX2
(Fig. 4). The intron retention found for CCDC43-YBX2 likely
results because intron 3 of CCDC43 is an AT—AC intron (for both
splice variants), whereas intron 4 of YBX2 is a GT—AG intron. The
resulting fused intron, with an AT at the 5’ splice site and an AG at
the 3’ splice site, is unlikely to be recognized by either the U2- or
U12-dependent spliceosomes (Tarn and Steitz, 1996).

5 DISCUSSION

Comrad provides the ﬁrst accurate computational method for
simultaneous analysis of RNA-Seq and low coverage WGSS data
for the purposes of identifying fused genes, and for differentiating
fusions of genomic origin from those fusions that are non-genomic,
i.e. co-transcription of adjacent genes or trans-splicing events. We
have used the C4-2 data and a theoretical analysis to show that
Comrad is able to discover fusions that other methods would not
be capable of discovering given the same data. The advantages of
Comrad are 2-fold. First, Comrad is able to leverage unambiguous
WGSS data in order to correctly identify a fusion transcript
supported by multi-map RNA-Seq data, and Visa versa. Second,
Comrad is able to accurately identify genomic rearrangements
that result in gene fusions, even if that genomic rearrangement
is supported by only one WGSS read. This second advantage
means that genomic rearrangements producing gene fusions can be
accurately identiﬁed in low coverage genome data, i.e. a Comrad
analysis can be performed for roughly twice the cost of an RNA-Seq
experiment.

As a proof of concept, we have shown that we are able to re-
discover, in the C4-2 data, 4 of 6 fusions previously identiﬁed in
the closely related cell line LNCaP. We then successfully validated
the fusion transcripts and rearrangement breakpoints for 6 of the

10 novel genomic fusions nominated by Comrad. All six fusions
were conﬁrmed by PCR for both C4-2 and LNCaP, showing that
Comrad is more sensitive to genomic fusions than previous methods
that have been applied to LNCaP. Additionally, we used deFuse to
identify fusion transcripts for which no genomic rearrangement is
detected by Comrad, despite the fact that a genomic rearrangement
is expected given the position and orientation of the genes involved.
We identiﬁed and validated ZDHHC20—TNFRSF19, possibly a
trans-splicing event, or possibly the product of a genomic inversion
and thus a false negative for Comrad in the C4-2 data. The fact that
only one high conﬁdence fusion transcript could be identiﬁed as a
potential false negative for Comrad implies that Comrad provides
a sensitive method for the detection of fusion transcripts with
associated rearrangement breakpoints.

Finally, we have used Comrad to gain new insight into the
biology of rearrangement fusions. We have identiﬁed instances of
non—canonical splicing in fusion transcripts produced by genomic
rearrangements, including activation of cryptic splice sites, and
intron retention due to incompatibility between the 5’ and 3’
splice sites of the rearrangement-induced intron. We have also
used a simple modiﬁcation of the Comrad framework to identify
reciprocal evidence of rearrangement breakpoints. The modiﬁed
framework led to the discovery of reciprocal evidence for both
interchromosomal fusions identiﬁed by Comrad. For one of these
fusions, MRPSlO—HPR, the location of the reciprocal translocation
coincides precisely with a translocation found in LNCaP by spectral
karyotyping (Beheshti et al., 2000). The other fusion, DGKB-
MIPOL1, a reciprocal was previously thought to be a result of
an insertion (Tomlins et al., 2007); however, Comrad has provided
evidence that this fusion could be the result of a reciprocal insertion.

RNA-Seq has already proven to be a powerful tool for the
discovery of aberrant transcripts, and WGSS has already proven
its utility when searching for rearrangements. We ﬁnd that an
integrated analysis of RNA-Seq and WGSS data minimizes some of
the limitations of analyzing either RNA-Seq or WGSS data alone,
and yields greater insight than either of these data types can provide
independently. Given the possible existence of rearrangement
fusions occurring at low levels of recurrence in cancer, the increased
accuracy and decreased cost associated with a Comrad analysis
may be useful when searching for these rearrangement fusions in a
large number of tumours. The identiﬁcation of such rearrangement
fusions would then hopefully assist in the classiﬁcation of molecular
subtypes and the development of targeted therapies.

ABSTRACT

Summary: RNA loop regions are essential structural elements
of RNA molecules influencing both their structural and functional
properties. We developed RLooM, a web application for homology-
based modeling of RNA loops utilizing template structures extracted
from the PDB. RLooM allows the insertion and replacement of loop
structures of a desired sequence into an existing RNA structure.
Furthermore, a comprehensive database of loops in RNA structures
can be accessed through the web interface.

Availability and Implementation: The application was implemented
in Python, MySQL and Apache. A web interface to the database and
loop modeling application is freely available at http://rloom.mpimp-

1 INTRODUCTION

Loop structures (i.e. regions without secondary structure) are not
only essential structural elements accounting for the ﬂexibility and
structural diversity of RNA molecules. They are also important
functional elements. For example, they frequently represent the
site at which ligands are bound to the RNA molecule. The lack
of canonical base pair formation in these regions makes them
accessible for intra— (e. g. tertiary structure contact formation) and
intermolecular contacts (e.g. binding of small molecules or other
biomolecules). The disparity between the number of available
RNA sequences on the one side and experimentally veriﬁed 3D
structures on the other calls for an application of computational
structure modeling to bridge this gap. Recently, we reported
results from a comprehensive survey of RNA loop structures and
established the basis for the application of homology modeling
to RNA loops(Schudoma et al., 2010). Sequence—similar loops
were found to fold into very similar structures. As a critical
sequence identity threshold beyond which this relationship no
longer holds, 25% sequence identity was determined. Here, we
present a web—based application for RNA loop structure modeling
utilizing available structures extracted from the Protein Data Bank
(PDB; Berman et al., 2000). In contrast to the existing RNA 3D
structure modeling applications [MC—Sym/MC—Fold (Parisien and
Major, 2008), NAST/C2S (Jonikas et al., 2009) and FARNA (Das

and Baker, 2007)] and RNA 3D structure databases [RNAjunction
(Bindewald et al., 2008), FRABASE (Popenda et al., 2008) and
SCOR (Tamura et al., 2004)], our approach is speciﬁcally tailored
to the application to RNA loop structures.

2 TEMPLATE LIBRARY GENERATION

We extracted loop structures [hairpins, internal loops, multiloops
and (single—stranded) segments] from 1371 RNA structures in
the PDB (December 2008) using secondary structure information
obtained from MC—Annotate base pair annotations (Gendron et al.,
2001). Segments comprise bulges as well as the individual strands
of internal loops and multiloops. The extraction followed these
extraction rules: (i) Stems are regions of two or more continuous
canonical base pairs (including GU/UG wobble pairs). (ii) Single
base pairs and stacked base pairs inducing pseudoknots are not
considered to be part of the secondary structure. (iii) Segments
and hairpins include one additional anchor residue on either side.
For hairpin loops, this corresponds to the closing base pair of
their preceding stem. These anchors allow for the matching and
insertion of a loop into a speciﬁed target site. (iv) Internal loops
are composed of 1—2 (with the former case representing bulges)
segments. Multiloops contain a number of individual strands less or
equal to their number of branching stems. We clustered the raw
loop datasets by sequence length, structural similarity [as given
by the root mean square deviation (RMSD) of the superpositions
of their reduced backbone atoms (P, 05’, C5’, C4’, C3’, O3’)],
and optionally, sequence identity. Using a range (0.5A—3.0A)
of incremental (0.5A) cutoffs, we generated eight clustered sets
of template loop structures of different degrees of sequence and
structural redundancy.

3 TEMPLATE LIBRARY CONTENT AND
DATABASE USAGE

The database contains 13 085 hairpin loops, 46 361 single—stranded
segments, 17 133 internal loops and 5756 multi—loops. For each loop,
we provide information on intra—loop base pairs, sugar pucker, and
base stackings as well as a visualization both as 3D structure model
[using Jmol (http://www.jmol.org/)] and contact graph. Entries for
structural clusters include the cluster representative structure, as well
as a consensus sequence, and a list of the structures belonging to
the cluster. Aside from browsing, the database can be queried by
sequence (including wildcard searches or matchings with errors) or
base pair patterns in MC—Search format.

4 LOOP MODELING

We adapted the protein loop modeling method of loops in proteins
(Michalsky et al., 2003) for RNA loops. The method ﬁnds the loop
templates that agree with a given query sequence and ﬁt best into a
target site of a given RNA structure. The target site is speciﬁed
by a number of nucleotide positions (anchors) that depends on
the loop type [cf. Section 2 (3)]. Modeling queries are dispatched
in a simple XML—like structured modeling script language —
RLooM Modeling Language (RLML, cf. RLooM Online Help). The
modeling workﬂow is depicted in Figure 1. The user submits an RNA
3D structure in PDB format (e. g. a crystal structure or a generated
structural model) and speciﬁes a target loop sequence and a target site
(two or more anchors depending on loop type) for the loop to be ﬁtted
into. Additionally, a query sequence or structure [base pair pattern
in MC—Search format (http://major.iric.ca)] for selecting suitable
loop candidates is required. An initial candidate set is generated by
matching the query sequence against the selected template library
(cf. Section 2). Next, each candidate loop is inserted into the target
site by computing the optimal superposition of the anchors of
candidate loop and target site utilizing the algorithm by Kabsch
(1978). The candidate loop is rotated according to the rotation matrix
associated with the optimal superposition and translated into the
target site. As a quality measure, we compute RMSDa, the RMSD
between the anchors after optimal superposition. Fitted candidate
loops with RMSDa > 5.0A are automatically rejected, since they
likely require a substantial change in their backbone conformation
to ﬁt into the target site. The whole construct is then checked for
steric clashes (deﬁned as atomic distances of <4.0A) with any
surrounding atom. The server returns the 10 best model structures
(with minimum RMSDa) for download. These models should be
subjected to an external reﬁnement routine in order to correct
geometric inconsistencies resulting from the loop ﬁtting.

5 CONCLUSION

We reported RLooM, a structure modeling web server for RNA
loop modeling based on sequence homology and geometric

constraints dictated by the site of insertion via anchor nucleotides.
The server uses loop templates extracted from experimentally
veriﬁed structures in the PDB. A performed benchmark (Schudoma
et al., 2010) showed that homology modeling approach as
implemented in RLooM yielded more accurate structural predictions
than an ab initio—based modeling server [the iFoldRNA webserver
(Sharma et al., 2008)] for target sequences with available sequence—
similar template structures. For nine selected examples covering
various loop sizes and types, our homology—based approach yielded
signiﬁcantly better results as judged by RMSD than obtained
by using iFoldRNA [cf. Schudoma et al. (2010) Supplementary
Table 1]. Evidently, for target loop sequences with no suitable
structural example in the database, no prediction can be made.
However, with the structural database steadily growing, this
modeling gap is expected to shrink substantially over the coming
years. RLooM was designed to harness the wealth of structural
information already available for applications in RNA modeling.
RLooM is expected to ﬁnd many applications in RNA engineering
and design.

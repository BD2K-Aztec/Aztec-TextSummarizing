Abstract

Summary: A major challenge for mass spectrometric—based lipidomics, aiming at describing
all lipid species in a biological sample, lies in the computational and bioinformatic processing of
the large amount of data that arises after data acquisition. Lipid-Pro is a software tool that supports
the identification of lipids by interpreting large datasets generated by liquid chromatography—
tandem mass spectrometry (LC—MS/MS) using the advanced data—independent acquisition mode
MSE. In the MSE mode, the instrument fragments all molecular ions generated from a sample and
records time—resolved molecular ion data as well as fragment ion data for every detectable molecu—
lar ion. Lipid-Pro matches the retention time—aligned mass—to—charge ratio data of molecular— and
fragment ions with a lipid database and generates a report on all identified lipid species. For gener—
ation of the lipid database, Lipid-Pro provides a module for construction of lipid species and their
fragments using a flexible building block approach. Hence, Lipid-Pro is an easy to use analysis tool
to interpret complex MSE lipidomics data and also offers a module to generate a user—specific lipid
database.

1 Introduction

 

Lipids are compounds of biological origin that are soluble in non—
polar solvents. In biological systems, lipids perform ubiquitous func—
tions such as construction of cell membranes, stabilization of mem-
brane—bound proteins, balancing of energy metabolism or cell
signaling (Wymann and Schneiter, 2008). All lipid species in a cell
or tissue are referred to as the lipidome. Changes Within lipidomes
have been closely linked to stress responses or various diseases

including diabetes, obesity, heart diseases or neurodegenerative dis—
eases (reviewed in Murphy and Nicolaou, 2013).
Liquid—chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry
(LC—MS/MS) is suitable for lipidome analysis since it can cover
a broad range of lipids (Harald et 61]., 2012). Both, data—dependent
acquisition (DDA) and data—independent acquisition (DIA) are
Widely used for LC—MS—based lipidomics. In DDA, the most abun—
dant molecular ions at each retention time (rt) are successively

Fig. 1. The graphical user interfaces of the five principal modules (Building Block, Precursor Candidates, Fragment Candidates, Mass Analyzer and Lipid
Identifier) of Lipid-Pro are shown. Results can be exported in Microsoft Excel format

selected for isolation and fragmentation. Despite the advantages
of the DDA approach, there are some inherent limitations such as
often irreproducible molecular ion selection, undersampling and
long instrument cycle times. DIA overcomes those limitations. MSE,
supported by Waters qTOF instrument platforms, acquires intact
molecular— and fragment ions in an unbiased manner by continu—
ously switching the energy for collision—induced dissociation be—
tween low (MS) and high (MS/MS) energy. DIA analysis requires
coherent and intricate data processing since it produces complex
data containing information on all molecular and fragment ions
at each rt.

Commercial and free downloadable software such as szine 2
(Pluskal et al., 2010) or Lipid Data Analyser (Hartler et al., 2011)
provide support to align and compare the spectral features of
LC—MS data. These applications identify lipid species in LC—MS
raw data by matching their monoisotopic masses or elemental com—
positions with a custom—based or online database. However, these
software applications do not consider fragmentation data.
LipidBlast (Kind et al., 2013) identifies lipid species by matching
the measured MS/MS spectra to an in silico generated library
after converting raw data into the MGF format. LipidBlast can
be used for the analysis of MSE data, but it is laborious to match
hundreds of different lipid species of the database with LC—MS/MS
data.

We developed the Lipid-Pro software solution for rapid identifi-
cation of lipids in preprocessed DIA data acquired with LC—MS/MS
using rt—aligned monoisotopic masses of molecular ions (MS) and
fragment ions (MS/MS). Since Lipid-Pro provides a module for con—
struction of lipid species and their characteristic fragments using a
ﬂexible building block approach, rare or even non—described lipids
beside the common species can be identified in total lipid extracts

of biological samples. To meet the technological objectives of this
research, we took a step forward in the development of a new user
friendly, modular and client—based database management system.
The Lipid-Pro application can be configured on Microsoft Windows
platforms following a simple six—step installation process.

2 Lipid-Pro

We developed Lipid-Pro as a desktop application (Fig. 1), helpful
for the identification of pre—defined lipid species (termed candidates)
in large LC—MSE datasets (or other DIA datasets from other instru—
ment platforms provided in the "' .csv data format). For automatic
generation of a lipid database, Lipid-Pro provides modules for the
construction of complex lipid species and their fragments using a
building block approach (Yang et al., 2009). By comparison with
the self—generated lipid database, pre—defined lipids are identified in
the preprocessed datasets by matching the rt-aligned mass—to—charge
ratios (in/z) of lipid molecular ions and fragment ions in an efficient
manner. As output, Lipid-Pro delivers information on the identified
lipid species including name, rt, m/z as well as the peak areas of lipid
species and their fragments.

Lipid-Pro comprises five modules working in product-line
architecture: Building Block, Precursor Candidates, Fragment
Candidates, Mass Analyzer and Lipid Identifier (Fig. 2). Each mod—
ule performs its task independently and its output is used as an input
for the next module until lipid identification is achieved.

2.1 Lipid database
The majority of lipid molecular species consist of a linear combin—
ation of a small number of chemical entities or building blocks from

Fig. 2. The conceptual architecture and work flow of the five principal modules of Lipid-Pro are shown

which naturally occurring lipids can be derived (Foster et al., 2013).
Molecular species of all glycerol—based lipids comprise a lipid
class specific backbone (here termed as ‘head’) esterified with one
or more fatty acids (termed ‘FA1’, ‘FA2’, ‘FA3’). For instance, all
phosphatidylcholine species consist of glycerophosphocholine (head)
and two acyl residues (‘FA1’ and ‘FA2’)

The Building Block module is used to calculate the monoisotopic
masses (mi) from the elemental composition of lipid class specific
‘heads’ and various ‘FA’s that are the principal building blocks
of complex lipids as well as different potential adduct ions (adduct).
Next, the Precursor Candidates module calculates the monoisotopic
masses of hundreds of complex lipid species by combining differ-
ent ‘head’ and ‘FA’ building blocks and also adds potential adduct
ions (adduct). In addition, a systematic name is generated that com—
prises the names of the head and the names of the ‘FA’s. The
Fragment Candidates module calculates the mi—values of expected
fragments. Since fragmentation predominantly involves cleavage
of ester bonds, the characteristic fragments can be derived from
the lipid candidates. In addition, a systematic fragment name is gen—
erated that comprises the name(s) of the building block(s) of the
fragment.

2.2 Lipid identification

For lipid identification in LC—MS/MS datasets, Lipid-Pro requires
two preprocessed files in "'.csv format that contain the rt—aligned
m/z—values of molecular ions (MS data) and rt—aligned fragment ions
(MS/MS data). For pre—processing of the raw data, we used MSE
DataViewerTM 1.2 (an external third party application) provided by
the manufacturer of the used instrument (UPLCTM—SynaptTM G2
HDMS, Waters).

After import of the preprocessed data into the Mass Analyzer
module, the monoisotopic masses of the putative molecular ions
(listed in the Precursor Candidates module) and the putative frag—
ments (listed in the Fragment Candidates module) are matched to
the measured m/z—values. The mass tolerance (‘m/z A’) is mainly
determined by the mass accuracy of the analytical system and can be
defined by the user.

Next, in the Lipid Identifier module, the time—aligned precursors
and fragments that have been found in the database are associated
according to their rt—values. The rt—tolerance is dependent on sev—
eral factors, such as the peak form or the measurement conditions,
and can be defined. Finally, all precursor hits are inspected for
the presence of all expected fragments. Therefore, the module checks
if the fragment’s name is a segment of the precursor‘s name.
Lipid candidates missing the expected fragments are removed. The
identified lipids can then be visualized by plotting the m/z-values
against the rt—values. Results can be saved, printed and exported
into Excel.

3 Conclusion

The most recent available and easy to use version of Lipid-Pro
has been tested and validated in—house. The advancements in
mass spectrometry techniques for lipid analysis combined with this
sophisticated computational tool can support various studies such
as gene function analysis or biomarker discovery.

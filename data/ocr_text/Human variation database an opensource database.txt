ABSTRACT

Motivation: Current public variation databases are based upon
collaboratively pooling data into a single database with a single
interface available to the public. This gives little control to the
collaborator to mine the database and requires that they freely share
their data with the owners of the repository. We aim to provide an
alternative mechanism: providing the source code and application
programming interface (API) of a database, enabling researchers to
set up local versions without investing heavily in the development
of the resource and allowing for confidential information to remain
secure.

Results: We describe an open-source database that can be installed
easily at any research facility for the storage and analysis of
thousands of next-generation sequencing variations. This database
is built using PostgreSQL 8.4 (The PostgreSQL Global Development
Group. postgres 8.4: http://www.postgresql.org) and provides a
novel method for collating and searching across the reported results
from thousands of next-generation sequence samples, as well as
rapidly accessing vital information on the origin of the samples. The
schema of the database makes rapid and insightful queries simple
and enables easy annotation of novel or known genetic variations. A
modular and cross-platform Java API is provided to perform common
functions, such as generation of standard experimental reports and
graphical summaries of modifications to genes. Included libraries
allow adopters of the database to quickly develop their own queries.
Availability: The software is available for download through
the Vancouver Short Read Analysis Package on Sourceforge,
http://vancouvershortr.sourceforge.net. Instructions for use and
deployment are provided on the accompanying wiki pages.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the introduction of next-generation sequencing technologies,
there has been a rapid increase in the amount of genomic
and transcriptomic sequence data generated. Consequently, an
ecosystem of bioinformatics applications and resources has grown
up around the ever-increasing volume of data being produced,
including aligners, assemblers, repositories and protocol speciﬁc
applications—mainly designed to investigate one genotype at a time.
Other databases and tools are available for performing analyses of

small groups or conducting genome wide association study (Fong
et al., 2010); however, a signiﬁcant keystone of this ecosystem has
yet to be introduced: a simple way to collate and search across large
numbers of sequenced libraries, particularly those for which the
analysis can not be supplied by tools external to the organizations
collecting the data.

Databases have long been a staple of bioinformatics research, with
the most common organizational model based upon collaboratively
pooling data into a single publicly available database. This allows
the developers to maintain control of the hosting and formatting
of the data, and also requires that collaborators should freely share
their data with the owners of the repository. In contrast, our project
provides an alternative mechanism: providing the source code and
application programming interface (API) for the implementation of
a local database, enabling researchers to set up private repositories
without investing heavily in the development of the resource
and allowing for conﬁdential information to remain secure. This
is an especially important model, when the genomic data is of
medical nature and cannot be publicly shared. However, distributing
the burden of development can signiﬁcantly provide a collective
bootstrap to researchers involved in the collection and analysis of
private genome or genome-derived datasets.

There are several advantages to collecting genomic information
in the proposed database versus analysis of a set of independent
DNA and RNA sequencing experiments. In contrast to publicly
available databases, such as dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001), a
local repository can be used to track more data about each
observation and more information can be stored about the library
of origin. Thus, common variations will quickly become easy
to identify, as will those that cluster into broad categories.
This makes it easy to conduct metagenomics experiments on
larger datasets and enables data mining for each new set of
sequencing data, building on previously performed experiments.
Finally, the database itself does not require any genomic annotation
system, and annotations can be imposed at the time of data
export. We provide an API that utilizes an Ensembl database
(http://agd.Vital-it.ch/info/software/java/index.html) to identify and
analyze genes/exons, applicable for most analysis needs.

2 METHODS

Novel ﬁmctions: the database enables four novel functions that would
be otherwise difﬁcult to accomplish: (i) the ability to rapidly access
genetic variation information across multiple datasets (e.g. to determine
the frequency of a change in the population); (ii) storing information in an
annotation-free manner, allowing the user to select the appropriate annotation

set to use (e.g. selecting which version of ensemble annotations to use);
(iii) rapid comparison of data from any sequencing platform, regardless of
the origin; and (iv) perform aggregate analyses, such as the assignment
of validation probabilities to observed variants based on sequencing
characteristics across a population. These functions are accomplished by
storing each variation observed in a manner indexed both by the library to
which they belong, as well as the location of origin in the genome to which
the reads were aligned.

Data: the database currently stores single nucleotide variations and
polymorphisms (SNV/SNPs), as well as deletions and insertions (indels).
We also import information from external databases such as dbSNP in the
form of annotations. These data can be used for concordance analysis and to
asses the quality of each imported dataset.

Interface: we include a Java API to handle communication with the
database, both for managing insertion and deletion of records, as well as
for extracting and analyzing recorded information. This API layer uses
function from the Ensembl (Hubbard et al., 2007) Java API (http://agd.vital—
it.ch/info/software/java) to gain genome annotation information used for
queries such as the ExperimentalRecord summary.

ExperimentalRecord: a common task is to search for variants present
within a single sample, and to compare them to variants in other samples
in the database. To simplify this process, we have produced a standard,
ExperimentalRecord query that provides a summary of the non-synonymous
variants (indels and single nucleotide substitutions) and variations likely to
interfere with splicing junctions. This report generating script makes use
of the Ensemble API for Java to obtain annotations for genes, exons and
transcripts, and to determine which variations in the database are likely to
affect coding regions.

Concordance: scripts are provided to compute concordance with SNPs and
indels from dbSNP. In the absence of validated sequencing results, this
provides an approximate method for assessing the quality of calls with an
expected background for the overall population. For indels, the concordance
API calls accept a window parameter in order to compensate for the difﬁculty
of rigidly deﬁning indel boundaries.

Graphic output: scripts are provided along with the Java API for obtaining
gene/exon coverage information from a variety of ﬁle formats. The
application combines information obtained from the variation database and
an Ensembl database with coverage information to provide an image in
Scalable Vector Graphics (SVG) format that can be used for visualizing
up to four groupings of data (e.g. RNA, exon capture, whole genome and
controls) at once, each of which can contain multiple distinct samples. The
end result is ideal for rapid comparison of groups of sequencing experiments.
Input Formats: the database currently accepts a wide variety of
formats including: GFF3 (http://www.sanger.ac.uk/resources/software/gffl),
SAM (Li et al., 2009), SNVmix (Shah et al., 2009), VCF and several custom
formats for SNVs. The application is also designed for quick and simple
addition of new formats as new variant callers become available.

Library information: in order to perform qualitative or quantitative analyses
across the many source datasets stored in the database, each dataset is
annotated with a minimal set of required information detailing the origin
of the sample (e.g. cancer versus normal, cell line versus tissue). This
enables users of the database to quickly identify the propensity of any given
variation to appear in a subset of the data, and provides the ability to perform
metaanalysis across the whole database rapidly to identify cancer-associated
variants.

Variation annotations: the database also holds annotations from both external
databases (e. g. dbSNP) and manual annotations. Java API utilities are
provided to facilitate this process.

Common use-cases: the database is commonly used for several major tasks,
including ﬁltering, validation, analysis and discovery. Filtering can be done
by utilizing annotations (e.g. dbSNP), matched pair datasets or datasets
marked as non-cancer for separating polymorphisms from putative variants.
Similar methods can also be used for identifying somatic mutations, driver
mutations or other mutations of interest in non-cancer related samples
(e. g. genetic diseases). API utilities exist for performing ﬁltering on sample
sizes ranging from single bases of interest to entire genome-wide studies.
Limited validation of variants can also be performed by searching for support
in other datasets, identifying the frequency of variants across cancer and
normal samples. Further, the frequency of variants in both general and
speciﬁc populations can be tested, lending credibility to commonly detected
variants, while identifying those which are more likely to be sequencing
errors (i.e. samples with low variant read depth in regions with high canonical
read depth or variants only sparsely detected across many independent
datasets). Several API utilities also exist for performing complex analysis,
such as identifying variants common to one or more datasets, but not found
in a second set of sequencing experiments. (e.g. this would be used for
identifying variants found in data obtained from cancers, but not found in
any of the matched normals.) Finally, the database is an excellent resource
for performing discovery of variants commonly found in cancers but not in
non-cancer samples or to identify common variations in genes of interest.

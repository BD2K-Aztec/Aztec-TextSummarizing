ABSTRACT

Motivation: Identification of single nucleotide polymorphisms that are
associated with a phenotype in more than one study is of great sci-
entific interest in the genome-wide association studies (GWAS) re-
search. The empirical Bayes approach for discovering whether
results have been replicated across studies was shown to be a reliable
method, and close to optimal in terms of power.

Results: The R package repfdr provides a flexible implementation
of the empirical Bayes approach for replicability analysis and meta-
analysis, to be used when several studies examine the same set of null
hypotheses. The usefulness of the package for the GWAS community
is discussed.

Availability and implementation: The R package repfdr can be
downloaded from CRAN.

1 INTRODUCTION

Replicating ﬁndings in genome-wide association studies (GWAS)
research is important for two main reasons. First, GWAS are
observational studies, and therefore there is always a danger that
bias may explain away the discoveries. If a ﬁnding is replicated in
more than one study, it is more convincingly not due to bias.
Second, ﬁnding the associations that are common in more than
one population is scientiﬁcally interesting.

A replicability analysis is primarily useful in the situation
where a GWAS meta-analysis is used at a primary (or discovery)
stage to suggest single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) to test
in additional follow-up studies. The SNPs that exhibit a strong
evidence for replicated associations across the studies in the pri-
mary stage, need not be followed up, as the replicability of as-
sociation has already been established. For example, in Voight
et al. (2010), the associations of SNPs in gene TCF 7L2 with type
2 diabetes in the studies considered in the primary stage pro-
duced a strong evidence of replicability, even when faced with
the many SNPs examined at this stage, and therefore there was
no need to follow-up on this gene.

The meta-analysis in the primary stage may identify SNPs that
have not been discovered in the replicability analysis of the pri-
mary stage studies. This does not imply the absence of true

replicated association, as it could be the result of small effect
size and/or limited sample size (i.e. lack of statistical power).
On the other hand, it could also be because of the effect not
being replicated, as a discovered association in a meta-analysis
may be entirely driven by a single study: if a P—value is close to
zero in one study, the association will be signiﬁcant in a meta-
analysis even if there is no association in all the other studies.
Using a follow-up study (or replication stage), the replicability of
association may be veriﬁed. See Bogomolov and Heller (2013)
for methods to establish replicability from follow-up studies.

Heller and Yekutieli (2014) present an empirical Bayes ap-
proach to replicability analysis. They estimate the probability
that the association was replicated in the same direction in at
least two studies, and declare as having replicated associations
the SNPs with estimated probability small enough so that the
estimated Bayes FDR is at most q (e. g. q = 0.05). For each SNP,
the null state is that the association is replicated in the same
direction in at most one study. More generally, Heller and
Yekutieli (2014) show how to test different null states according
to the interest of the user, where meta-analysis corresponds to the
null state of no association in all the studies. They verify the
optimality and FDR control of this approach in extensive simu-
lations and demonstrate its usefulness and power in detecting
SNPs that are associated with type 2 diabetes in several studies.
Here, we present the R package repfdr that provides a ﬂexible
and efﬁcient implementation of the method in Heller and
Yekutieli (2014).

2 METHODS

Suppose n GWAS studies examine the same phenotype. The input data
for analysis are the n vectors of one-sided P—values, one vector per study.
Following Efron (2010), the P-values are transformed into z—scores (using
the inverse standard normal cumulative distribution). The three main
analysis steps are—(i) in each study, bin the z—scores and estimate the
non-null probabilities for each bin; (ii) estimate the probabilities of asso-
ciation status by an expectation-maximization (EM) algorithm; (iii) esti-
mate the Bayes FDR and select which hypotheses have replicated
ﬁndings or meta-analysis ﬁndings, depending on whether the aim is rep-
licability analysis or meta-analysis. Step (i) can be done using our func-
tion ztobins that calls the R package locfdr, or by any other software the
user chooses. Our main function repfdr performs steps (ii) and (iii),
requiring as input the binned z—scores, and the null and estimated non-
null probabilities for each bin in each study. Our function 1dr reports the
estimated posterior probabilities for SNPs of interest. Details about the
computation of the estimated parameters can be found in Heller and
Yekutieli (2014).

In step (ii) the number of parameters estimated by the EM is expo-
nential in n: if the association can be either null, or positive, or negative,
then the EM estimates 3” parameters; if the association can be either null
or non-null (e. g. only in one direction), then the EM estimates 2” param-
eters. On a computer with 12 GB memory, it is possible to estimate these
parameters for n = 5 studies using 3 x 106 SNPs, or for n = 6 studies
using 106 SNPS, but there is not enough memory for n = 6 studies using
3 x 106 SNPs. Moreover, the greater the number of parameters, the
larger the amount of data (SNPs) necessary for reliably estimating the
parameters. If a large number of studies are available, we therefore rec-
ommend ﬁrst grouping the studies into fairly homogeneous clusters of
studies, then computing the meta-analysis P-value for each cluster of
studies and ﬁnally applying our software to discover the replicated fmd—
ings across clusters of studies.

The implementation of repfdr (written in R and C) allows it to take
advantage of parallel processing, improving its efﬁciency. By default, the
software automatically detects the number of available processing
threads.

2.1 Example

We give a data example which is a simulation of three GWAS from the
simulator HAPGEN2 (Su et al., 2011), thus emulating real GWAS data.
Each study is summarized by the z—scores for the test of association of an
SNP with a binary outcome in the same 249024 SNPs. Our speciﬁc
question is—which SNPs show replicated association with the phenotype?
i.e. for which SNPs the association with phenotype is present in more
than one of the studies? In the package, it is shown how to summarize the
ﬁndings and conclude about this question.

We have 33 possible vectors of association status for each SNP. When
we test for no association, the null set is just the zero vector. We get 239
SNP discoveries at the Bayes FDR of 0.05. For replicability analysis, we
have 13 states in our null set, and we discover 119 SNPs at the Bayes
FDR of 0.05. Supplementary Figure S1 shows a Manhattan plot of the
negative logarithm of the estimated Bayes FDRs for replicability (top)
and for association (bottom) versus the genomic coordinates.

Noting that the replicability analysis ﬁndings are typically a subset of
the ﬁndings from an analysis to detect associations, SNPs may be dis-
covered only in the latter analysis for two possible reasons: either because
of insufﬁcient power for establishing replicability, or because of the
association being present only in a single study. Among these SNPs,
identiﬁcation of those with replicated association may be done using a
follow-up study that examines only these SNPs (239-119 = 120 SNPs in
this example) in an independent study [6. g. using the methods in

Bogomolov and Heller (2013), implemented in the Web application
http://www.math.tau.ac.il/~ruheller/App.html].

3 CONCLUSION

In large problems where it is possible to estimate well the un-
known parameters, the empirical Bayes replicability analysis is
useful. In particular, this is so for GWAS, where discovering
SNPs with replicated associations is of great scientiﬁc interest.
Speciﬁcally, the replicability analysis using the P—values of sev-
eral published GWAS that examine the same complex disease
can shed light on the genetic architecture of the disease by iden-
tifying the SNPs that have replicated associations across studies
as well as the SNPs associated with the disease that show no
evidence (or inconsistent evidence) of replicability of associ-
ations. Our package provides a way of performing this analysis,
and the theoretical justiﬁcations are given in Heller and Yekutieli
(2014). The proposed approach is a general approach for assess-
ing replicability in several studies when each study examines the
same hypotheses. Therefore, it can be used for applications other
than GWAS, as long as the marginal and non-null densities can
still be reasonably well approximated for each study, and the
dependency of the test statistics within each study is local.

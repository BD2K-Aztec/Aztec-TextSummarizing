Abstract

Summary: We have developed Rchempp, a web service that identifies structurally similar com—
pounds (structural analogs) in large—scale molecule databases. The service allows compounds to
be queried in the widely used ChEMBL, DrugBank and the Connectivity Map databases. Rchemcpp
utilizes the best performing similarity functions, i.e. molecule kernels, as measures for structural
similarity. Molecule kernels have proven superior performance over other similarity measures and
are currently excelling at machine learning challenges. To considerably reduce computational
time, and thereby make it feasible as a web service, a novel efficient prefiltering strategy has been
developed, which maintains the sensitivity of the method. By exploiting information contained in
public databases, the web service facilitates many applications crucial for the drug development
process, such as prioritizing compounds after screening or reducing adverse side effects during
late phases. Rchemcpp was used in the DeepTox pipeline that has won the Tox21 Data Challenge
and is frequently used by researchers in pharmaceutical companies.

Availability and implementation: The web service and the R package are freely available via http://

shiny.bioinf.jku.at/Analoging/ and via Bioconductor.

1 Introduction

One strategy to remedy the steadily declining efficiency of the drug
development process is to utilize the vast information on chemical
compounds that is already present in public and internal databases
(Arrowsmith, 2011; Scannell et 61]., 2012). To this end, compounds
that are structurally similar to the current drug candidate have to be
identified in public databases. This ‘structural analoging’ step can
enhance the drug development process at different phases: After
high-throughput screening, a number of compounds are selected, of
which typically very little information about their biological effects
is available. Querying these compounds in a database can yield simi—
lar compounds that have already been measured in various biolo—
gical experiments and provide relevant information (Klambauer

et 61]., 2013; Robert et 61]., 2008; Rodriguez et 61]., 2005) (Fig. 1).
This information can improve the drug development process at vari—
ous stages and decreases the risk of late failures (Verbist et 61].,
2015

The best-performing similarity measures for identifying structurally
similar compounds in a database are molecule kernels. Molecule kernels
have been developed for similarity—based machine learning methods,
such as Support Vector Machines, and their efficiency and precision
have been demonstrated in various tasks (Mahe and Vert, 2009; Mahe
(2005 ); Mohr et 61]., 2010; Ralaivola et 61]., 2005). The drawback of
molecule kernels is that they are computationally demanding, since they
consider all possible common substructures of a compound. To reach a
query time of a few seconds, which is desired for web services, we have

developed a novel and computationally fast criterion that maintains the
sensitivity of the molecule kernels. We have extensively tested the pre—
sented software in our computational pipeline for prediction of toxic ef-
fects of chemical compounds. This computational pipeline ‘DeepTox’
has won both the Tox21 Data Challenge (http://www.ncats.nih.gov/
news—and—events/features/tox21—challenge—winners.html) and the predic-
tion of average cytotoxicity at the NIEHS—NCATS—UNC DREAM
Toxicogenetics Challenge
#lSynapsezsyn2208373/wiki/).

We provide a web service, called Rchemcpp, to identify structur—
ally similar compounds in ChEMBL (Gaulton et 61]., 2012),
Drugbank (Law et 61]., 2014) and the Connectivity Map (Lamb
et 61]., 2006). This provides researchers with various types of infor-

(https://www.synapse.org/

mation about chemical compounds and thereby helps to prioritize
structures and facilitates decisions based on biological measure—
ments. Rchemcpp combines efficiently implemented molecule ker—
nels with a new prefiltering strategy and offers a user—friendly
interface to adjust the kernel parameters. Rchemcpp is a valuable
tool for researchers in many areas in particular in drug design, tox-
icity prediction and cancer research.

The web service Rchemcpp has many advantages over a pro—
gramming library for molecule kernels. To use molecule kernels re—
quires extensive programming efforts. Therefore, many researchers
are restricted to database queries provided by the database inter—
faces, which are based on simple substructure searches. We provide
molecule kernels as a hands—on tool for researchers of all areas and
backgrounds. Furthermore, the preparation, curation and clean—up
of the databases that is necessary for applying molecule kernels is
included the Rchemcpp web service. Additionally, the problem of
high computational power that restricts queries in the large data—
bases such as the ChEMBL has been solved by our prefiltering
strategy.

2 Methods

The method consists of computation of the molecule kernel and a
prefiltering step for speeding up the calculations. For large data—
bases, such as ChEMBL, a prefiltering step is necessary to identify
structural analogs in reasonable time for a web service.

2.1 Molecule kernels
A molecule kernel is a function that maps two chemical compounds
to a similarity value. The similarity measure is typically based on

structural similarity, i.e. the number of substructures that occur in
both compounds. If we consider two molecules X and Y, then the
kernel K is:

K(X7Y): N(p7X)'N(p7Y)7 (1)

17673
where P is the set of substructures, and the function N (p, X) counts
how often the substructure p occurs in molecule graph X. The func-
tion N (p, X) is specific for the different kernel types (see
Supplementary Section S4).

2.2 Prefiltering

For query compound X and each compound Y from the database, a
small set of features is calculated in advance to make the comparison
computationally fast. We investigated how this prefiltering strategy
changes the result compared to a database query without prefilter—
ing. With the prefiltering strategy, a speed—up is obtained that is ne—
cessary for a web service, while at the same, some highly similar
molecules might be lost. We calculated how much the sensitivity of
the method is decreased by filtering out a certain percentage of mol—
ecules from the database (see Supplementary Fig. 82): Overall, the
decrease in sensitivity is small, e.g. when removing 99.5% of the
compounds in the prefiltering step, i.e. a speed—up of 200—fold, still a
sensitivity of 55% is kept.

3 Example: a query compound

To illustrate our structural analoging approach, we use a query com—
pound (left in Fig. 1), of which only the chemical structure is known.
In the following, we show how to obtain information on this query
compound using our novel web service Rchemcpp.

3.1 Biomolecular targets from CHEMBL

The query for structural analogs in ChEMBL, a database with 1 mil—
lion molecules, provided compound ‘CHEMBL57990’ as the closest
analog to our query compound (top in Fig. 1). For this compound,
ChEMBL reports strong inhibitory activity against the epidermal
growth factor receptor (EGFR). This receptor is crucial for the pro-
liferation of cancer cells. A compound with inhibitory activity
against EGFR can be a potential drug for certain cancer types. All
10 closest structural analogs to the query compound are strong
EGFR inhibitors (see Supplementary Table 81), therefore we can hy—
pothesize that the query compound may act as an EGFR inhibitor.

3.2 Gene expression signature from the Connectivity
Map

When we identified the closest structural analogs from the
Connectivity Map, gefitinib was ranked first, followed by a tyr—
phostin AG 1478, a compound named ‘CP—645525—01’ and amo—
diaquine (middle in Fig. 1). From compounds with a similarity
greater than 0.90, a gene expression signature was derived from
the Connectivity Map data (see Supplementary Section 82). The
gene expression data of the Connectivity Map were preprocessed
with FARMS (Hochreiter et 61]., 2006; Talloen et 61]., 2007, 2010)
and informative/non—informative (I/NI) calls (Clevert et 61]., 2011;
Hochreiter et 61]., 2010; Hochreiter, 2013; Klambauer et 61].,
2012)

3.3 Mechanism of action from Drugbank
The closest structural analogs in Drugbank are gefitinib, compounds
with the identifiers DB03365, DB02984, DB02848 and erlotinib

(bottom in Fig. 1). The Drugbank contains information on the
mechanism of action of these compounds. The database reports that
both gefitinib and erlotinib are marketed drugs for the treatment of
certain tumor types. Both have EGFR as biomolecular target. For
gefitinib, the mechanism of action is known: it binds to the ATP—
binding site of EGFR, inactivates the Ras signal transduction cas—
cade and thereby inhibits malignant cells. We have now obtained a
second hint that the query compound may act as an EGFR inhibitor.

In summary, we have acquired information about a query com—
pound: bioassay measurements from ChEMBL, a potential gene ex-
pression signature from the Connectivity Map and a potential
mechanism of action from Drugbank. The results indicate that the
query compound could be an EGFR inhibitor.

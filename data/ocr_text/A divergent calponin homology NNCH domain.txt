ABSTRACT

Motivation: Microtubules are dynamic polymers of tubulin dimers that
undergo continuous assembly and disassembly. A mounting number
of microtubule-associated proteins (MAPs) regulate the dynamic be-
havior of microtubules and hence the assembly and disassembly of
disparate microtubule structures within the cell. Despite recent ad-
vances in identification and functional characterization of MAP3, a
substantial number of microtubule accessory factors have not been
functionally annotated. Here, using profile-to-profile comparisons and
structure modeling, we show that the yeast outer kinetochore compo-
nents NDC80 and NUF2 share evolutionary ancestry with a novel pro-
tein family in mammals comprising, besides NDCSO/HEC1 and NUF2,
three Intraflagellar Transport (IFT) complex B subunits (IFT81, IFI'57,
CLUAP1) as well as six proteins with poorly defined function (FAM98A-
C, CCDC22, CCDCQ3 and C14orf166). We show that these proteins
consist of a divergent N-terminal calponin homology (CH)-like domain
adjoined to an array of C-terminal heptad repeats predicted to form a
coiled-coil arrangement. We have named the divergent CH-like
domain NN—CH after the founding members NDC80 and NUF2.

1 INTRODUCTION

Microtubules are dynamic polymers that form a variety of cyto-
skeletal constellations in the eukaryotic cell. Common to all
microtubule arrangements, ranging from the short centrioles of
the centrosome to the elaborate structures of the mitotic spindle
in mitosis or the axoneme of cilia, are a set of microtubule-asso-
ciated proteins (MAPS) that inﬂuence the dynamics, stability and
function of the tubulin polymer (Desai and Mitchison, 1997).
Many putative MAPS and accessory components of the mitotic
spindle, centrosome and cilia have not been functionally anno-
tated. This is due in part to the high abundance of coiled-coil
propensity proteins populating these subcellular compartments
(e.g. Arnaiz et al., 2009). Coiled-coil containing proteins are no-
toriously difﬁcult to functionally annotate because of the high
degree of sequence redundancy of coiled coils, which renders
coiled-coil segments unsuitable for phylogenetic analysis. Some

MAPS associated with e.g. kinetochores or centrosomes, how-
ever, adopt a bipartite structure comprising, besides their coiled
coil hub, a globular head domain. The presence of such a con-
served domain can greatly facilitate the identification of remote
homologs in other Species. For instance, in NDC80 (HECl in
humans; hereafter referred to as NDC80) and NUF2 of the
NDC80 kinetochore complex, or the microtubule plus end-track-
ing proteins EBl-3, the coiled-coil region is preceded by a con-
served N-terminal calponin homology (CH) domain, which has
aided in the identification of orthologs (Ciferri et al., 2008;
Hayashi and Ikura, 2003; Korenbaum and Rivero, 2002; Wei
et al., 2007). In the NDC80 kinetochore complex, formed by
heterodimerization of NDC80 and NUF2, the interaction be-
tween the C-terminal coiled-coil regions produces a microtu-
bule-binding interface consisting of two tightly interacting CH
domains (Ciferri et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2007). Structural analysis
has indicated that the NDC80 CH domain resembles that of the
first CH domain of human ﬁmbrin, which itself adopts a diver-
gent CH domain fold Wei et al., 2007). Despite this structural
similarity, previous sequence-based analyses have not identiﬁed
NDC80 as a member the proposed major groups of CH domain-
containing proteins (Gimona et al., 2002).

Here we Show by means of sequence proﬁle-to-proflle analysis
that NDC80 and NUF2, three Intraﬂagellar Transport (IFT)
complex B subunits, as well as six other poorly defined proteins
constitute a novel family of bimodular proteins containing a di-
vergent N—terminal CH-like domain followed by a C-terminal
region of heptad repeats predicted to form a coiled coil arrange-
ment. We have named the divergent CH-like domain NN—CH
after the founding members NDC80 and NUF2.

2 METHODS

pBLAST and Iterative BLAST searches with PSI-BLAST were per-
formed at NCBI (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast.cgi) and MP1 bio-
inforrnatics toolkit (http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de) servers (Biegert
and Soding, 2009; Soding et al., 2005), respectively, using the non-redun-
dant (NR) protein sequence database at NCBI. Default settings were
utilized in the searches. Unless otherwise stated, proﬁle-to-proﬁle
hidden Markov model (HMM)—HMM searches were performed using
HHpred (Soding et al., 2005) with default settings against the PFAMA
database (http://pfam.sanger.ac.uk). For Figure 1, multiple sequence
alignments (MSA) were built by MAFFT (http://myhits.isb-sib.ch/cgi-
bin/mafft) (Katoh et al., 2002) and the resulting alignment edited in

acid numbers) of the NN—CH domains are indicated. Coloring schemes as per Clustalx parametres in Jalview. Positions where hydrophobicity is
conserved, which participate in the alpha-helices of the CH fold, are blue and designated 11 in the consensus sequence shown below the alignment.
Aromatic residues are abbreviated a. Hydrophobic (h, blue), histidine/tyrosine (turquoise), acidic (violet), glycine (brown), proline (light green) and
serine/threonine (dark green). Regions corresponding to alpha helices, predicted by HHpred and based on NDC80, are shown above the alignment (see
also Supplementary Fig. S2). For accession numbers, see Supplementary Table S1

Jalview (http://www.jalview.org/). The consensus of the alignment was
calculated and colored using the Clustalx color scheme implemented in
Jalview. Secondary structure information and structural alignment were
predicted using HHpred (Soding et al., 2005). For Supplementary Figure
S2 amino acid sequences were retrieved at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.
nih.gov/protein) and aligned with the COBALT server (http://www.ncbi.
nlrn.nih.gov/tools/cobalt). Sequence alignments were analyzed for the oc-
currence of secondary protein structure in the Ali2D program (http://
toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/ali2d). MODELLER (http://toolkit.tuebingen.
mpg.de/modeller) (Sali et al., 1995) was employed for homology modeling
of 3D structures using templates chosen based on highest probability and
signiﬁcantly low E—value to the target sequence, as obtained in HHpred
by mining the PDB and SCOP databases. Resulting 3D model coordin-
ates were analyzed in Discovery Studio 3.5 Visualizer. Coiled-coil pro-
pensities were predicted as high propensity heptad repeats in Coils (http://
embnet.vital-it.ch/software/COILS_form.html) (Lupas et al., 1991) using
weighted and unweighted search algorithms. Identiﬁed coiled-coil regions
were further validated based on the occurrence of alpha-helical content
(>50% helical) using the HNN server (http://npsa—pbil.ibcp.fr/cgi-bin/np
sa_automat.pl?page=/NPSA/npsa_hnn.html).

3 RESULTS

In an effort to functionally annotate uncharacterized members of
the core centrosome as well as accessory factors, we surveyed the
protein architecture of previously identiﬁed and putative

centrosomal proteins (Andersen et al., 2003; Howng et al.,
2004; Jakobsen et al., 2011). We noted that proteins such as
Cl4orfl66/CGI-99 and FAM98B bear homology by sequence
to the N—terminus of kinetochore protein NDC80. High prob-
ability sequence similarities between, e. g. the N-terminus of
human FAM98B (aa 9—128) with the N-terminus of NDC80
are apparent by HMM-based proﬁle-to-proﬁle searches using
either local or global search algorithms in HHpred (local/
global probabilities 9246/9060 and E—values 0.049/0.017)
(Soding et al., 2005). Interestingly, as with NDC80, the
C-terminus of human FAM98B (aa 195—231) contains disparate
arrays of heptad repeats (Fig. 2) as predicted by weighted and
unweighted matrices in Coils (Lupas et al., 1991), indicating that
these proteins are members of a common evolutionary family of
coiled-coil proteins.

To identify additional NDC80 paralog candidates, we ﬁrst
searched the PFAM database in HHpred using a HMM based
on ﬁve reiterative PSI-BLAST searches initiated with the NN—
CH domain of human NDC80 (aa 98—195). This search identi-
ﬁed the DUF2465 domain (PFAM entry PF10239) of the
FAM98 protein family as the highest scoring match (probability
95.14, E 20.018), suggesting that FAM98 (A—C) carry a NN—
CH domain. The alignment of DUF2465 was merged with the
NDC80 alignment to initiate a subsequent HMM—HMM search

against the PFAM database. We repeated this procedure once
more, totalling three iterative HMM—HMM searches, to compile
all the matched alignments that produced only high probability
scores (>95). The resulting MSA was used to kick-start HMM—
HMM searches in the PFAM database directed speciﬁcally
against human proteins (Soding et al., 2005). We thus identiﬁed
10 human proteins with high probability homology to the
NDC80 N—terminus (Figs 1, 2 and Supplementary Table S1).
Each protein was validated by reciprocal HMM—HMM searches
for the occurrence of a conserved NN—CH domain. In each in-
stance, the minimal N—terminal portion showing sequence hom-
ology to NDC80 was extracted and used as a query in HHpred.
We conﬁrmed the presence of the NN—CH domain in all 10
identiﬁed proteins with probability values >95, suggesting genu-
ine homology to the NN—CH domain of NDC80. Alignment-
based secondary structure predictions using the Ali2D program
(http://toolkit.tuebingen.mpg.de/ali2d) supported these ﬁndings
(Supplementary Fig. S2). Further, we could predict an
N—terminal tertiary-structure model of each protein NN—CH
domain that was compatible with the known 3D structure of
the NDC80 N—terminus (Supplementary Fig. S1) (Wei et al.,
2007). Structural threading using MODELLER (Sali and
Blundell, 1993) conﬁrmed human NDC80 (2IGP) as the best,
and statistically signiﬁcant match in a search in the PDB data-
base for similar tertiary structures (detailed list of all PDB entries
found is available upon request).

To examine the NN—CH proteins for the co-occurrence of
coiled-coil conformations, the C-terminal portion of each pro-
tein candidate was ﬁrst probed for the presence of heptad
repeats in Coils (Lupas et al., 1991) and subsequently
analyzed in HNN for high alpha-helical content coinciding
with heptad repeat tendency. Interestingly, all newly identiﬁed
NN—CH domain-containing proteins were predicted to harbor
C-termini consisting of long alpha-helical matrices exhibiting
a high-degree coiled-coil propensity (Fig. 2), suggesting that
all the NN—CH protein derivatives structurally resemble
NDC80.

Although the N—terminal domain of NDC80 was shown to
adopt a CH domain fold (Wei et al., 2007), our searches failed
to detect any high-scoring matches to canonical CH domain-
containing proteins such as EBl (Hayashi and Ikura, 2003),
consistent with previous sequence-based analyses of CH
domain-containing proteins (Gimona et al., 2002). Likewise, a
HMM—HMM search seeded with the CH domain of human EBl
(Hayashi and Ikura, 2003) failed to recover signiﬁcant matches
to any of the newly identiﬁed NN—CH domain-bearing protein
proﬁles in PFAM, indicating that the NN—CH domain repre-
sents a discrete branch of the CH domain protein family. In
support of this, a comparative analysis of the history and evolu-
tion of the NN—CH family members, as assessed by pair-wise
BLAST searches against representative proteomes, revealed that
all NN—CH family members likely evolved from a precursor of
yeast NDC80 and NUF2 (Supplementary Table S1).

The NDC80 and NUF2 proteins thus share common ancestry
with all NN—CH domain derivatives. Based on the homology of
NN—CH proteins to components of the yeast NDC80—NUF2
kinetochore complex, we propose that these proteins, including
the ciliary IFT—B proteins identiﬁed in this survey, evolved, at
least partly, as a specialized form of the kinetochore Nd080p
complex.

4 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSIONS

For many coiled-coil proteins such as MAPS, components of
centrosomes and the IFT—B complex of cilia, evolutionary an-
notation based on comparative analysis has been hampered by
sequence redundancy of coiled coils and the lack of a
conserved reference domain. This is in contrast, for example,
to many IFT—A proteins, which display homology to vesicle
coating and nuclear pore complex proteins (J ekely and Arendt,
2006; van Dam et al., 2013). Here, using proﬁle-to-proﬁle
searches, we Show that three IFT—B proteins and several
poorly characterized human proteins belong to a family of
bimodular NN—CH and coiled-coil proteins that appears to
share common ancestry with yeast NDC80. The NN—CH do-
mains were identiﬁed as a novel branch of the CH domain.
Structure analysis of NDC80 revealed that the NDC80 N—ter-
minus adopts a CH domain fold (Ciferri et al., 2008; Wei et al.,
2007). Indeed, fold searches seeded with NN—CH proﬁles against
the PDB database recovered signiﬁcant hits to the solved
NDC80 structure as well as to canonical CH domains conﬁrming
that the NN—CH and CH domain adopt the same tertiary
structure.

Several of the identiﬁed NN—CH proteins associate with micro-
tubule-based structures, namely kinetochores/spindle microtu-
bules, centrosomes and cilia. First, NDC80 and NUF2 bind
directly to microtubules at the outer kinetochore (Tooley and
Stukenberg, 2011) and a FAM98B ortholog was identiﬁed as a
meiotic MAP in Xenopus (Gache et al., 2010). Second, CCDC93
and Cl4orf 166 co-fractionate or interact with centrosome proteins
(Howng et al., 2004; Jakobsen et al., 2011). Third, IFT81, IFT57
and Cluapl are components of the IFT—B complex in ﬂagella of
Chlamydomonas reinhardtii (Cole et al., 1998) and other organisms
(Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008), and are required for ciliogenesis
(Botilde et al., 2013; Li and Sun, 2011; Pasek et al., 2012; Perkins
et al., 1986; Tsujikawa and Malicki, 2004). Since the NN—CH

domains of the NDC80—NUF2 dimer directly bind to kinetochore
microtubules (Ciferri et al., 2008; Wei et al., 2007), it is likely that
the other NN—CH family members similarly interact directly with
microtubules, although association with other known CH domain
interactors, such as F-actin, cannot be ruled out (Sjoblom et al.,
2008). This has interesting implications for the three IFT—B pro-
teins IFT57, IFT81 and Cluapl. IFT is required for the assembly
and maintenance of virtually all eukaryotic cilia and ﬂagella
(Pedersen and Rosenbaum, 2008) and consists of large IFT pro-
tein complexes that fractionate as two biochemically distinct IFT—
A and IFT—B sub-complexes. These are transported anterogradely
and retrogradely along the ciliary axoneme, together with asso-
ciated ciliary cargo proteins/building blocks, by kinesin-2 and
cytoplasmic dynein-2 motors, respectively (Pedersen and
Rosenbaum, 2008). In contrast to IFT—A proteins the origin of
the majority of the IFT—B polypeptides is unknown (van Dam
et al., 2013). Our ﬁnding that IFT81, IFT7 and Cluapl share
overall protein architecture with NDC80 and NUF2 indicates
that they may have microtubule binding properties. Indeed,
while this article was in review, an elegant study was published
demonstrating that the amino terminus of IFT81 contains an
NDC80-like CH domain (PDB entry 4LVP) that directly binds
tubulin (Bhogaraju et al., 2013). Moreover, IFT81 was found to
interact directly with IFT74 (Bhogaraju et al., 2013; Lucker et al.,
2005), forming a dimeric complex that binds puriﬁed tubulin and
microtubules with high afﬁnity (Bhogaraju et al., 2013). Another
recent study also indicated the presence of a CH domain in the N-
terrninus of IFT57 and IFT81 (Taschner et al., 2012), but a phylo-
genetic relationship with NDC80, NUF2 and other NN—CH
domain proteins was not reported.

Collectively, we identiﬁed a novel protein family of 11 proteins
in the human proteome that contain a novel CH domain, which
we have named the NN—CH domain. The conserved bimodular
protein composition of the NN—CH members, comprising a
NN—CH domain and a coiled-coil region, and the association
of these members with the kinetochore, centrosome and cilia
suggest that the novel NN—CH protein family members function
in various microtubule-associated activities.

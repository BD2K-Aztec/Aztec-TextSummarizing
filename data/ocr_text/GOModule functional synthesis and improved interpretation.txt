ABSTRACT

Summary: GO—Module is a web-accessible synthesis and
visualization tool developed for end-user biologists to greatly
simplify the interpretation of prioritized Gene Ontology (GO) terms.
GO—Module radically reduces the complexity of raw GO results
into compact biomodules in two distinct ways, by (i) constructing
biomodules from significant GO terms based on hierarchical
knowledge, and (ii) refining the GO terms in each biomodule
to contain only true positive results. Altogether, the features
(biomodules) of GO-Module outputs are better organized and on
average four times smaller than the input GO terms list (P=0.0005,
n=16).

1 INTRODUCTION

Gene Ontology (GO; Ashbumer et al., 2000) is a standardized
representation of biological gene attributes organized in a directed
acyclic graph structure, where nodes are GO terms and edges are
the hierarchical relationships between them. Prioritized GO terms
are routinely computed in functional analyses of genomic studies
such as gene expression proﬁles and high-throughput sequencing.
Enrichment and gene set analyses have been implemented to identify
signiﬁcant GO terms from large prioritized gene lists, such as DAVID
(Dennis et al., 2003), Onto-express (Draghici et al., 2003a), Global
test (Draghici et al. , 2003b), G0stats (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007),
etc. However, when presented with the resulting extensive list of
GO terms, biologists cannot readily synthesize their relationships
and rigorously prioritize hypotheses.

Two approaches have generally been used for reﬁning
overabundant GO terms resulting from genomic studies. The ﬁrst
approach reduces the number of GO terms studied thus decreasing
the total prioritized ones. For instance, GOSlim (Harris et al.,
2004) contains a small list of 127 key terms (2010 August version)
curated a priori by expert biologists, while GOPaD dynamically
calculates the most informative subset of GO terms from a prioritized
gene list by disregarding other statistically signiﬁcant GO terms

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

(Alterovitz et al., 2007). These approaches are designed to eliminate
a massive number of GO terms deemed as signiﬁcant by statistics,
thus severely limiting the expressiveness of the resulting list of GO
terms. A second group of approaches removes falsely prioritized GO
terms that are computational artifacts attributable to the inheritance
of genes (signal) in the GO hierarchy occurring in enrichment
studies (Rhee et al., 2008). For example, a bottom-up conditional
hypergeometric test can conservatively remove inherited genes
annotated to statistically signiﬁcant descendants nodes before testing
the parent GO nodes (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007; Grossmann
et al., 2007). However, this test also eliminates true-positive GO
nodes such as those whose child nodes are all signiﬁcant. We
developed an approach that only prunes a parent node if its
inherited signal is equal or worse to that of its most statistically
signiﬁcant child (Lee et al., 2010). This approach retains key
parent GO terms whose increased statistical signiﬁcance is ampliﬁed
by inheriting multiple children’s signals indicating an overarching
systems property, a key GO term, emerging from subsumed GO
terms.

We hypothesized that grouping prioritized GO terms in
biomodules could further improve their interpretation by biologists,
and would thus allow for the synthesis and reduction of the
overall number of biological features while explicitly encapsulating
subsumed GO terms. This approach focuses on biomodules of GO
terms rather than of individual genes. While prioritized gene lists
have been shown to aggregate in biomodules associated to GO terms
in co-expression (Wolfe et al., 2005) and protein interaction studies
(Cho et al., 2007), software designed to group gene lists into gene
biomodules using GO knowledge produce large numbers of GO
terms for interpretation without any coherent organization.

2 GO BIOMODULE ONLINE TOOL: GO-MODULE

Here we described GO-Module, a user-friendly, parameter-free and
web-accessible synthesis and Visualization tool developed for end-
user biologists to improve their analysis of prioritized GO terms
by removing false-positive GO terms and organizing the remaining
ones as GO biomodules. We previously described the algorithm as a
hierarchical reﬁnement of a prioritized list of GO terms (Lee et al.,
2010). Three characters are used to annotate the results where ‘K’
refers to the l_<ey terms of GO biomodules, ‘T’ refers to the truly
signiﬁcant hierarchical descendents of the key terms and ‘F’ refers
to the false positive prioritized GO terms among the input. This

GO-Module

 

algorithm follows the steps described below and is illustrated in
more detail in Supplementary Fig. S1.

Inputs: GO-Module requires a table containing: (i) a list of
prioritized GO IDs and (ii) their corresponding rankable qualiﬁers,
such as P-values or simply ordinal numbers.

(1) Annotates a node as ‘K’ (key GO term) if every one of its
children or parents is less prioritized than itself. To allow
for straightforward interpretation of the key GO terms as
‘local minima in a directed acyclic graph’, these key terms
are locally prioritized within contiguous relationships (e.g.
parent and child).

(2) As long as contiguous descendents of a ‘K’ node are not
themselves new ‘K’ nodes, GO-Module annotates them as
‘T’ (subsumed true-positive GO terms as a member of the
biomodule).

(3) Assigns ‘F’ (false positive) to the remaining GO terms.

(4) Assigns a unique numerical label to each ‘K’ GO term and to
all its ‘T’ descendants. Note that this assignment is a number
that has no bearing on the rank and that a ‘T’ node may have
more than one biomodule label.

Output: GO-Module provides three alternative output formats of
identiﬁed terms and their relationships in biomodules: (i) an online
table, (ii) a downloadable text ﬁle with ﬁve columns containing two
input columns following by labels of signiﬁcance, full names of the
GO IDs and identiﬁed GO biomodules or (iii) a ﬁxed graphic vector
network visualization of resultant IDs or their terms (pdf format)
preferably for lists of up to 500 GO terms.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

Example data: To demonstrate the efﬁcacy of GO-Module, we
examined prioritized GO lists reported in the literature (Table 1).

Results: GO-Module signiﬁcantly reduces the features as
measured by the ratio of 16 literature reported GO lists to their
number of resultant biomodules (Table 1, #K/#G0 ranging from 28
to 91%; P200005, n= 16, Wilcoxon’s signed rank test compared
with theoretical median of 100%). Speciﬁcally, we report that on
average 28% of input terms were found to be false positives (F),
and among the remaining K and T terms, 33% are linked together
in GO-Module of two or more terms (data not shown). Relatively
general terms were rejected in several of the independently published
GO lists because their P-values were larger than that of their
children terms. In two cases in Table 1, ‘regulation of tumor necrosis
factor biosynthetic process’ (GO:0042534) was rejected, while its
child term ‘positive regulation of tumor necrosis factor biosynthetic
process’ (GO:0042535) was retained (Heinig et al., 2010 in Fig. 1;
Marcucci et al., 2008), demonstrating that this feature reduction
eliminated redundant GO terms, while retaining useful informative
ones. Self-evident uninformative terms such as ‘positive regulation
of biological process’ (GO:0048518) are also annotated as false
positive by GO-Module in Figure 1.

Conclusively, by synthesizing signiﬁcant GO outputs and
constructing biomodules, GO-Module better facilitates the
biological understanding and interpretation of genetic analyses.
Additionally, GO-Module can reﬁne GO signatures found using
conventional methods without requiring that the user revisit any
gene expression or G0 databases. By requiring prioritized GO

aTwelve scientiﬁc papers (16 GO lists) were selected in the following way: the ﬁrst ﬁve
were prioritized by a Google search for ‘signiﬁcant GO terms’ and each of four renowned
journal names and the remaining seven were sequentially found in the journal Genome
Research by manually searching from 12/2010 back to 5/2010 for GO lists containing
more than eight prioritized terms.

bOnly the reported terms with trackable ofﬁcial GO IDs using AmiGO (Ashbumer
et al., 2000) version 1.7 were used as the input for GO-Module.

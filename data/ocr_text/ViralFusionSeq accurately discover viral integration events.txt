ABSTRACT

Summary: Insertional mutagenesis from virus infection is an important
pathogenic risk for the development of cancer. Despite the advent of
high-throughput sequencing, discovery of viral integration sites and
expressed viral fusion events are still limited. Here, we present
ViralFusionSeq (VFS), which combines soft-clipping information,
read-pair analysis and targeted de novo assembly to discover and
annotate viral—human fusions. VFS was used in an RNA-Seq experi-
ment, simulated DNA-Seq experiment and re-analysis of published
DNA-Seq datasets. Our experiments demonstrated that VFS is both
sensitive and highly accurate.

1 INTRODUCTION

Viral infection accounts for 15—20% of human cancers
(Morissette and Flamand, 2010). Well-known cancer-associated
viruses include the Human papillomavirus (HPV) and the
Epstein—Barr virus (EBV), which are present in nearly all cervical
cancers ONalboomers et al., 1999) and nasopharyngeal carcin-
oma (NPC) (Young and Rickinson, 2004), respectively. Hepatitis
B virus (HBV) infection is a strong etiologic factor for hepato-
cellular carcinoma worldwide (Chemin and Zoulim, 2009). Some
viruses like HPV and HBV commonly integrate into the host
genome, where they predispose to genome instability and
cancer risks (Zhao et al., 2012). Nevertheless, the ability to pre-
cisely locate the viral insertional sites has long been hindered by
previous low-resolution techniques and thus limiting research
into the mutagenic effects of such integrations. Viral integration
in the host can either be episomal or induce viral—human fusion
transcript (Schmitz et al., 2012). Integration of HBV can be de-
tected in as much as 90% of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC),
where clonal expansion of the same integration site has been
reported (Cougot et al., 2005; Jiang et al., 2012; Sung et al.,
2012). It is hence not only important to identify the sites of

genome integrations, but also to discover transcribed viral—
human sequences, which both may possess a functional role in
tumorigenesis. SeqMap 2.0, an earlier web-based system, uses
pre—defined viral features to locate viral integration sites
(Hawkins et al., 2011). Unfortunately, their framework is speciﬁc
to the 454 sequencing platform and does not address the con-
cerns many have of data privacy. Besides, reliability of the
putative fusion breakpoints was not evaluated. More import-
antly, as HBV has no preferential sites in the human genome
to be integrated into (Kraus et al., 2008; Wentzensen et al.,
2002), the framework could not discover novel viral—human in-
tegrations. More recently, VirusSeq was proposed for detecting
the presence of viral species in sequence data, and ﬁnding viral
integration events using discordant Read Pair (RP) information.
Through alignments, VirusSeq was able to identify regions of a
chromosome that fused with a virus (Chen et al., 2013).

Here, we propose a genome-wide viral fusion discovery and
annotation pipeline. Our method resembles CREST Wang
et al., 2011) and ClipCrop (Suzuki et al., 2011), both of which
use soft-clipping to identify genomic structural variations. What
sets our method apart from theirs is our focus on viral integra-
tion and the use of viral genome(s) as the primary input to our
pipeline. Our uniﬁed pipeline ViralFusionSeq (VFS) is used for
discovering viral integration events and expressed fusion tran-
scripts using high—throughput sequencing (HTS). The most not-
able difference between VFS and other tools is that VFS uses
both RP and Clipped Sequence (CS) information to find viral
fusion events and breakpoints (Supplementary Section S1).
Using the latter, VFS is able to discern fusion breakpoints ac-
curately to single-base resolution. Moreover, VFS is generalized
to major sequencing platforms, and is applicable to both DNA-
and RNA-Seq data.

2 METHODS

2.1 RNA-Seq, simulation experiment and re-analysis of
real DNA-Seq data

We performed paired-end transcriptomic sequencing on a HBV-infected
HCC cell-line HKCI—5a by Illumina HiSeq 2000 (Supplementary Section
S2). We applied VFS on this RNA-Seq data, followed by validation
with Sanger sequencing. Afterwards, we demonstrated VFS on our
simulated DNA-Seq dataset and re—analyzed a published DNA dataset
(Sung et al., 2012).

2.2 Discovery of putative fusion events

Using the Burrows-Wheeler Aligner (BWA) (Li and Durbin, 2009), VFS
starts with pre—processing the sequence reads according to BWA’s trim-
ming algorithm. Quality-trimmed sequence reads are then mapped onto
viral sequences. Sensitive mapping is achieved by the use of (i) viral and
human decoy sequences that have incorporated different haplotypes or
assemblies of references to allow mapping of reads originated from rather
divergent strains or sequenced subjects, and (ii) the use of BWA-SW
algorithm implemented in BWA (Li and Durbin, 2010), which is opti-
mized for the increasingly common longer sequencing reads.

BWA-SW performs Smith—Waterman local alignment. For viral—
human chimeric sequence reads, the viral portion would be aligned as
mapped sequences (MS), leaving the unaligned human CS as overhang.
These overhangs are soft-clipped and the sequence is retained in the
alignment ﬁle (Li et al., 2009). VFS extracts all CS and MS and deter-
mines breakpoints using the soft-clipping information. Speciﬁcity of map-
ping to viral sequence is evaluated to avoid false mapping, which might
happen due to simultaneously mapping an excessive quantity of sequence
reads onto viral sequences. The function, implemented by BLAST,
scrutinizes both the MS and CS for signiﬁcant matches to non-target
species. In the process of identifying fusion partners, read-level analysis
is performed (Fig. l).

2.3 Reliability of fusion breakpoint and
annotation ranking

VFS uses a simple yet effective empirical statistical method to evaluate the
quality of fusion breakpoint and rank fusion’s annotation. The concept is
based on the Minimal Match on Either side of Fusion (lVIMEF) (Wang
et al., 2010). For each fusion event, the reliability is directly computed by
MMEF using the following equation:

MMEF = Min[(L1en — me), (R1en — Rmm)]s

where Llen and Rlen represent alignment lengths and LInn and Rmn indi-
cate mismatches along the alignment. The sub-score of each fusion part-
ner is directly calculated by subtracting [en by mm. The best fusion
candidate with the highest sub-score is selected. The composite MMEF
score is the minimal of the two sub-scores. The score becomes higher
when the sequence length of the respective side of the fusion is more

balanced, conferring higher uniqueness to the respective genome or
gene-set of the target species.

Fusion events are annotated by numerous data sources, including
NCBI Nucleotide and RefSeq databases and human repetitive elements
identiﬁed by RepeatMasker, which were obtained from the UCSC
Genome Browser.

2.4 Reconstruction of fusion transcript by paired-end
information

VFS is capable of exploiting both CS and RP information to reconstruct
fusion transcripts. Fusion breakpoint sequences are used as seeds to per-
form targeted assembly on RNA-Seq data. VFS executes the RP fusion
detection method to identify all sequence reads with one end mapped
onto the viral genome and the other on to the human genome. Then,
sequences mapped onto respective genomes are subjected to targeted de
novo assembly; these include (i) CS and their paired mates from the CS
module; (ii) reads from the RP module; and (iii) RPs with one end
mapped in the vicinity (500 bp) of the human regions reported by the
RP module.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
3.1 RNA-Seq experiment

Viral integration in HCC often elicits transcriptional impact on
cancer marker genes, suggesting the importance of expressed
fusion transcripts (Jiang et al., 2012). We performed RNA-Seq
on HKCI—5 to a depth of 11 Gb. VFS identified three candidate
fusion events in HKCI—5a, of which all could be successfully
validated by Sanger sequencing. We highlight the most compli-
cated fusion transcript formed between the HBV core gene
and the human chr7 containing CDHR3 and T RRAP
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Sequence data have been deposited in
NCBI Sequence Read Archive under the accession SRA061758.
Other fusion events will be described elsewhere (manuscript in
preparation).

3.2 Simulation experiment

To get a better understanding of the two modules that form the
basis of VFS: the CS and the RP module, we conducted a set of
simulation experiments. Our aim was to determine the sequen-
cing depth required to identify a fusion event using either or both
methods. Synthesized data allow us to know beforehand where
the virus has fused with the host chromosome. The simulation
experiment showed that VFS is highly sensitive and accurate.
While the RP module reports fusion events with accuracy
equal to the inner insertion length, the CS method was able to
identify 90% of the fusion events within an accuracy of :l:3 bp.
Combining the two methods gave the best overall performance.
Our simulation also determined that sequencing depth coverage
of 10x was sufficient for the detection accuracy to saturate.
(Supplementary Section S3).

3.3 Re-analysis of real DNA-Seq data

We re—analyzed the whole genome sequencing data of HBV-in-
fected HCC samples using VFS. Two samples (198T and 268T)
were randomly chosen (Sung et al., 2012). Remarkably,
VFS pinpointed all the exact fusion breakpoints reported by
Sung et al. Sung reported viral—human integration events only

Discovery of viral integrations by ViralFusionSeq

 

at the genomic DNA level, and it is currently unknown if those
reported fusion events would be transcribed. On the other hand,
we generated our own RNA-Seq data on one HBV-infected
HCC cell line, and then identified and validated three fusion
events that are being actively transcribed. In terms of number
of reported integration events, Sung et al. reported an average of
two validated integrations per cell lines, which is comparable
with our findings (Supplementary Section S4).

4 CONCLUSION

To the best of our knowledge, VFS is the first approach for
simultaneously discovering novel viral—human fusion events
and reconstructing transcript sequences at single-base resolution.
VFS represents an improvement on a methodology that will
help with the discovery of viral integration events and expressed
transcripts in diseases with viral integration.

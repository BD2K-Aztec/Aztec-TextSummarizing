ABSTRACT

Motivation: The identification of nucleosomes along the chromatin is
key to understanding their role in the regulation of gene expression
and other DNA-related processes. However, current experimental
methods (MNase-ChlP, MNase-Seq) sample nucleosome positions
from a cell population and contain biases, making thus the precise
identification of individual nucleosomes not straightforward. Recent
works have only focused on the first point, where noise reduction
approaches have been developed to identify nucleosome positions.
Results: In this article, we propose a new approach, termed
NucleoFinder, that addresses both the positional heterogeneity
across cells and experimental biases by seeking nucleosomes
consistently positioned in a cell population and showing a significant
enrichment relative to a control sample. Despite the absence of vali-
dated dataset, we show that our approach (0 detects fewer false posi-
tives than two other nucleosome calling methods and (ii) identifies two
important features of the nucleosome organization (the nucleosome
spacing downstream of active promoters and the enrichment/deple-
tion of GC/AT dinucleotides at the centre of in vitro nucleosomes) with
equal or greater ability than the other two methods.

1 INTRODUCTION

Eukaryotic genomes exist in highly packaged structures called
chromatin. DNA wraps around globular protein cores and
appears as ‘beads on a string’ by electron microscopy. The
‘bead’, or nucleosome, is the fundamental structural unit of the
chromatin and consists of ~150 base pairs coiled 1.65 times
around a histone octamer core comprising two H2A/H2B and
two H3/H4 heterodimers (Luger et al., 1997). The ‘string’, also
called the linker, is a DNA stretch ranging from 10 to 80 bp,

depending on species, cell type and chromatin region.
Nucleosomes can further be folded into higher order organiza-
tions to eventually form a chromosome (F elsenfeld and
Groudine, 2003). The need for these high level structures arises
from a packaging problem: the DNA molecule is long (chromo-
somes range from 1.7 to 8.50m in human) and negatively
charged, resulting in electrostatic repulsions that stiffen the poly-
mer and prevent it from ﬁtting inside the nucleus. Owing to the
highly basic charge of histone proteins, DNA charges are neu-
tralized, allowing a compaction up to a factor of 10000 (Jiang
and Pugh, 2009).

This compaction is not homogeneous throughout the genome
and restricts both the binding of transcription factors and the
recruitment of effector protein complexes (such as chromatin
remodelling complexes) to certain regions (Millar and
Grunstein, 2006). Chromatin has commonly been viewed as
being in either an active form (euchromatin) or a repressed
form (heterochromatin). The former, characteristic of active
transcribed regions, is lightly packed (up to the 30 nm ﬁber
compaction) and allows regulatory proteins and transcription
complexes to bind to the DNA. The latter, tightly packed, is
associated with gene silencing and the protection of chromosome
structures such as centromeres and telomeres (Elgin, 1996).
Because of its inﬂuence on the binding of transcription factors,
the packaging of DNA into nucleosomes provides important
regulatory functions Wuan et al., 2005). In yeast for instance,
Shivaswamy et al. (2008) demonstrated that gene activation
and repression are associated with changes (eviction, appear-
ance or repositioning) of one or two nucleosomes in promoter
regions.

The development of high-throughput assays has allowed the
mapping of nucleosomes across the genomes of various model
organisms (Lee et al., 2007; Mavrich et al., 2008; Schones et al.,
2008; Valouev et al., 2008). These recent studies have revealed
common features across species : at expressed genes (i) the
\sim150 base pairs region upstream of the transcription start
site (T88) is depleted of nucleosomes, (ii) nucleosomes show a
regular spacing at the 5’ end of genes and (iii) this regular
nucleosome spacing, also called phasing, gradually decreases
from the 5’ to the 3’ end of the coding region (Bai and
Morozov, 2010). Even if our understanding of the nucleosome
organization has considerably improved, the questions of the
relative inﬂuence of cis and trans factors in the nucleosome orga-
nization as well as the role of nucleosome positioning in gene

regulation remain active areas of research. A major challenge in
addressing these questions is that the precise identiﬁcation of
individual nucleosomes is rendered complex by current assays
which (i) are biased and (ii) sample nucleosomes positions
across a cell population, as discussed below, raising the need
for nucleosome calling methods that account for both issues.

The main experimental bias arises from the use of the micro-
coccal nuclease (MNase) to isolate the DNA fragments bound to
histones (nucleosomal DNA). In addition to digesting naked
DNA, the MNase is known to cleave AT/TA dinucleotide
motifs as well as showing other, more subtle, sequence speciﬁcity
(Horz and Altenburger, 1981). After measuring the nucleosomal
DNA either by microarray (MNase-chip) or deep sequencing
(MNase-seq), the resulting nucleosome map thus reﬂects regions
both depleted of nucleosomes and rich in AT/TA dinucleotides.
Even though Kaplan et al., (2010) showed that nucleosome
protection is the dominant factor in MNase digestion, it is desir-
able to control for this bias along other potential experimental
biases. In MNase-Chip experiments, this is done by hybridizing
nucleosomal DNA against a control sample (naked genomic
DNA). By contrast, in MNase-Seq experiments, because nucleo-
somal and control DNA are assayed separately, the experimental
biases can only be corrected at the nucleosome calling stage.
However, because the majority of the MNase-Seq studies do
not include control samples (notable exceptions including
Valouev et al., 2008, 2011; Zhang et al., 2009), current nucleo-
some calling methods tailored to MNase-Seq data do not take
into account control samples.

Regarding the second point, because nucleosomes are assayed
in a cell population, their associated reads (or intensities in the
case of MNase-Chip) are either normally distributed within
~15 bp of the nucleosome centre when highly phased, or
uniformly distributed otherwise (Jiang and Pugh, 2009). This
variation in read positions reﬂects both the positional heterogen-
eity across cells and the over-trimming or under-trimming of the
DNA at nucleosome borders during sample preparation.

Nucleosome calling methods recently developed aim to iden-
tify the footprint of phased nucleosomes from a signal processing
perspective. They commonly involve two steps of background
noise ﬁltering and peaks scoring. These methods include
Laplacian of Gaussian (Zhang et al., 2008a), Fourier
Transform (Flores and Orozco, 2011), correlation with nucleo-
some footprint WVeiner et al., 2010), mixed methods (Di Ges
et al., 2009) for MNase-Seq data and Hidden Markov Models
for MNase-Chip data (Kuan et al., 2009; Lee et al., 2007;
Yassour et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2005). However, no current
methods include control data that can provide important
additional information for inferring nucleosome positioning.

In this article, we introduce NucleoFinder, a new statistical
approach for MNase-Seq data analysis that aims to identify
nucleosomes consistently positioned in a cell population
(phased) and showing a signiﬁcant enrichment relative to a
control sample. NucleoFinder is based on nucleosome position-
ing, a concept commonly used in MNase-Seq analyses (Field
et al., 2008; Kaplan et al., 2009; Valouev et al., 2008, 2011;
Zhang et al., 2009) to quantify the extent to which nucleosome
positions vary across the cell population assayed. This statistic
relates the number of read counts in a 30 bp window (to account
for the MNase cleavage uncertainty, Jiang and Pugh, 2009) to

the number of read counts in the two 60 bp ﬂanking windows.
The larger is this ratio, the more precisely positioned the nucleo-
some is. To take into account the control information in the
nucleosome positioning measurement, we extend this idea by
looking for the pattern not enriched, enriched, not enriched be-
tween the nucleosome and control samples in three consecutive
windows 60, 30, 60 bp long.

Our ﬁrst attempt was based on the binomial test that measures
the relative enrichment in the nucleosome sample relatively to the
control sample. Because it is based on the relative enrichment, this
test did not deal well with background noise and led to a high false
positive rate: when in a given region, few random reads (a couple)
were present in the nucleosome sample but not in the control
sample, the null hypothesis (equal enrichment in both samples)
was rejected and the region declared as nucleosome. To circum-
vent this, we model the difference in read counts between nucleo-
some and control samples. The difference is truncated to zero, as
negative values do not provide any additional information apart
from the fact that the considered region is not enriched. This
truncated difference is then modelled using a Poisson distribution
where prior distributions on the rate parameter are either gamma
or uniform. Lastly, to distinguish relatively high background noise
from local peaks in the two side windows, we split them into two
30 bp long windows. Ideally, even smaller windows would be pref-
erable to differentiate regions where reads cluster from those with
a high number of randomly distributed reads, but the ~30 bp
measurement uncertainty prevents us to do so.

2 METHODS

In this section, we provide details on the data and statistical model
developed.

2.1 Data

The dataset and preprocessing steps used in this analysis are taken from
Valouev et al (2011), where nucleosomes were isolated from three haem-
atopoietic cell lines (CD4+, CD8+ T cells and granulocytes) as well as
in vitro and in a control samples. They were then treated with micrococcal
nuclease to release nucleosome cores, and deep sequenced using the
SOLiD platform (Pandey et al., 2008). The resulting 25 bp reads derived
from the 5’ end of nucleosomal DNA were subsequently mapped against
the human th8 assembly and yielded a genome coverage ranging be-
tween 16—28x. Reads that mapped to more than one single location were
discarded. Following the data processing used by Zhang et al. (2008b), (i)
genomic positions covered by an excessive number of reads were removed
(because likely to arise from ampliﬁcation and sequencing errors, Zhang
et al., 2008b), and (ii) nucleosome centres were obtained by adding 75 bp
to the 5’ end position of the reads (Zhang et al., 2009). Reads position
were then binned into 30 bp windows in each dataset. The CD4+, CD8+
T cells, granulocytes and in vitro samples were ﬁnally corrected by sub-
tracting the number of reads in each 30 bp window by the number of
reads in the control falling in the same window. Negative values were
truncated to 0.

2.2 Statistical model

2.2.1 Likelihood Given a 150 bp region, let X = {x1,x2,x3,x4,x5}
denote the corrected number of nucleosome centres falling in each of the
ﬁve 30 bp bins. The bins are grouped into three segments S 2 {S1, S2, S3}
that include bins {{1,2},{3},{4,5}}, respectively. Each random variable x,-
is assumed Poisson distributed with parameter 2,. The number of reads is

assumed independent from one bin to another, which allows the likeli-
hood to be factorized. The likelihood of X is expressed as:

5
N(X|/i) = Ema-ii.) (1)
i=1

2.2.2 Priors Whether segment j is background or enriched, the
prior on 2,- is either:

0 7r(/ibg) = Ga(o?, ,8), i.e. gamma distributed with parameters {65, ,8}
estimated chromosome by chromosome from the data using the
method of moments. The hyperparameters are not directly estimated
with Ga(o?, ,8) but from the marginal distribution that we introduce
below. Since most of the nucleosomes in the human genome show
little or no sign of positioning, the data consist mainly of randomly
distributed reads. Hence, the estimation of the hyperparameters from
the data should allow to capture the background nucleosome
distribution.

nae”) = Unif(0, xmax), i.e. unifome distributed in the interval
[0, xmax], where xmax denotes the maximum read counts in the cor-
responding chromosome X. Unlike Ga(o?, ,8) which has most of the
mass concentrated around 0, this prior gives same weight to all read
counts.

2.2.3 Marginal likelihood Our main interest is to ﬁnd regions that
match the proﬁle of well-positioned nucleosomes, i.e. when S2 is enriched
and {S1, S3} are background. To capture this pattern, we introduce eight
models that cover all possible combinations of hbg and lien in S1, S2 and
S3, as indicated in Table 1. In each 150 bp sliding region, the marginal
likelihoods associated with these eight models are calculated. When M1
has the largest marginal likelihood among the models, this region is con-
sidered as a well-positioned nucleosome. The reason for using eight
models is that it allows a better discrimination between well-positioned
nucleosomes and background or randomly enriched regions.

Since the calculation of the marginal likelihood is similar across the
models, we only illustrate it with M1, where the priors are as follows:

Ga(o‘r, 3) ,i# 3

TIT/liM =
(I 1’ {Unif(0,xmax) ,i=3

71'(XIM1)= /n(x|/I,M1)n(/IIM1)d/l

n(xIM1)=x— x3, dig- H Neg—Bm(x.-Ia,i3)

ie{1,2,4,5}

 

where 7r(/l|-) = ﬂ Nazi)

The poissonlahd gamma distributions being conjugate, the marginal
likelihood can be calculated in closed form using the negative-binomial
distribution (Gelman et al., 2004). This is, however, not the case with the
uniform prior, where the marginal likelihood can nevertheless be calcu-
lated by successive integrations by part. To avoid the calculation of this
integral every 150 bp window, we compute it for x3 6 [0, xmax] and store
the results during the initiation stage of NucleoFinder to speed-up the
execution.

As mentioned above, a nucleosome is detected when the marginal
likelihood associated with M1 is the largest of all models. In addition
to the information of the presence/absence of a nucleosome, it would be
desirable to have a sense of how enriched and well-positioned are the
detected regions. A good measurement is provided by the Bayes factor

3 RESULTS

An important feature of the nucleosome organization in eukary-
otic genomes is that nucleosome positions are variable across
conditions, tissues and individuals. This implies that large-scale
regions consistently occupied by nucleosomes on which
nucleosome calling methods could be compared do not exist.
Even in yeast, considered mainly populated by well-positioned
nucleosomes (Radman-Livaja and Rando, 2010), substantial
divergences have been found across studies. An example is
provided in Yassour et al. (2008) where the authors compared
their predictions with a small set of experimentally veriﬁed
nucleosomes taken in Segal et al. (2006). The authors found
that neither their predictions nor those of Yuan et al. (2005)
and Lee et al. (2007) are consistent with this reference dataset.
This means that there are no true positives available on
which nucleosome calling methods can be tested with high
conﬁdence.

Despite this absence of large-scale validated dataset, we com-
pare the performance of NucleoFinder with two popular
(MNase-Seq) nucleosome calling methods, NPS (Zhang et al.,
2008a) and TemplateFilter WVeiner et al., 2010) based on (i) their
speciﬁcity, (ii) their ability to identify the uniform nucleosome
spacing occurring near active promoters in vivo and (iii) their
ability to detect the stereotypical A/T and G/C dinucleotide pat-
terns present at well-positioned nucleosomes in vitro Walouev
et al., 2011). These two methods are run with the parameters
set to their default values. To rule out the possibility that the
signature detected by these methods could be identiﬁed by simple
clustering, we also run K-means by iteratively increasing the
number N of clusters until one of them matches the pattern of
well-positioned nucleosomes (i.e. not enriched, enriched, not
enriched in three consecutive windows 60, 30, 60 bp long).
In the following analysis, N = 4.

3.1 Speciﬁcity

To have a general idea of how NucleoFinder relates to K-means,
NPS and TemplateFilter, the four methods are ﬁrst compared on
chromosome 22 (CD4+T cells) where common predictions
across methods, deﬁned as the predictions whose central 30 bp
overlap, are counted. Out of 247 874 predicted regions, 23.5, 18.8
and 12.7% were common to two, three or four methods, that is,
more than half of them are predicted by at least two methods.
This result indicates that, although agreeing on a large number of
regions, these four approaches capture slightly different aspect of
the nucleosome signature. When looking at each method indi-
vidually, it can be noticed that the total number of predictions
(Table 2) as well as the proportion of method-speciﬁc predictions
is much larger in K—means and TemplateFilter than in NPS and
NucleoFinder (Fig. 1a). These large numbers of predictions
found with K-means and TemplateFilter suggest that they
either have higher sensitivity or perform less well.

We then estimate the speciﬁcity of these four methods by
randomly permuting reads in 1kb windows along chromosome
22. Even though the locations of well-positioned nucleosomes are
unknown, the best method is that for which the number of
predictions is large before permutation and small after (suggest-
ing both a good sensitivity and speciﬁcity). The speciﬁcity is
calculated by considering the predictions after permutation as
false positives (FP, it is not excluded that nucleosome-like
patterns occur by chance after permutation though) and the
remaining regions (not called) as true negatives (TN):

#TN
#TN + #F P (4)

A total of 203 976, 68099, 27218 and 205 768 false positives
are generated by K-means, NPS, NucleoFinder and
TemplateFilter, respectively, resulting in a higher speciﬁcity of
NPS and NucleoFinder relative to K—means and TemplateFilter
(Table 2). If we compare the number of predictions before and
after permutation, we observe a ~25 % increase for K-means and
TemplateFilter, a nearly identical result for NPS, and a decrease
of ~70% for NucleoFinder. The fact that after permutation,
NucleoFinder has the smallest number of predictions and the
largest decrease in prediction supports the idea that it is speciﬁc
of well-positioned nucleosomes.

However, the results of K-means after permutation should be
interpreted with caution as they rely on the assumption that the
data consist of genuine nucleosome signal: after K-means has
clustered the data into four groups, the label ‘nucleosome’ is
assigned to the cluster (its associated regions) whose proﬁle
matches that of nucleosome. This means that whether the
input data contain good or poor quality data (permuted data),
this approach always generates nucleosome predictions.

The large number of false positive found by TemplateFilter is,
on the other hand, probably owing to the variety of templates
used by this method to detect nucleosomes. The representative
templates, inferred from the authors’ data, are correlated with
forward- and reverse-strand reads for various distances between
the two strands (the correlation threshold used to call a nucleo-
some can be adjusted by the user). The important variability
across templates (one or two peaks with different widths,
see Supplementary Fig. 81, Weiner et al., 2010) suggests that

and TemplateFilter

they can capture various nucleosome proﬁles (high sensitivity),
but at the same time, are more likely to pick up nucleosome-like
patterns (or background noise) present after permutation. This
idea is coherent with the relatively ﬂat nucleosome proﬁles found
with TemplateFilter before and after read permutation (Fig. 1b
and c, see explanation below), corresponding to a mixture of
templates with different shapes. One possible explanation for
which NucleoFinder suffers less from the permuted data is that
it explicitly models the null and the alternative hypotheses (back-
ground and enriched regions).

To further understand the characteristic of these four meth-
ods, a stereotypical proﬁle is built for each of them by averaging
the read counts in 10 bp bins along their predictions, before
and after permutation. Before permutation, the four methods
result in fairly different bell-shaped proﬁles where unlike
TemplateFilter, both K-means and NucleoFinder proﬁles
reveal a sharp enrichment in the central 30 bp window and a

low background in the side windows (Fig. 1b). After permuta-
tion, the average level of enrichment decreases substantially in all
four methods and, except for K—means and NucleoFinder, their
proﬁles ﬂatten out. Although both have a pronounced enrich-
ment in the central segment, these last two methods resulted in
very different numbers of predictions (Table 2). This difference is
likely owing to the higher stringency of NucleoFinder in the side
segments, as the low average read counts shows (Fig. 1b and c).
This is consistent with the high speciﬁcity of NucleoFinder
described earlier and supports the idea that NucleoFinder only
detects the signature of well-positioned nucleosomes.

3.2 Inter-nucleosome distance comparison

According to the barrier model (Mavrich et al., 2008), the steric
hindrance imposed by RNA Pol II induces a compact and regu-
larly spaced nucleosome array within ~1kb and progressively dis-
sipates when moving away from the TSS. The spacing just
downstream of the TSS is therefore expected to be of the same
order of magnitude as estimated at active promoters (178—187 bp,
Valouev et al., 2011). For each approach, we estimate the
inter-nucleosome distance in the 1kb region downstream of
TSSs of highly expressed genes, deﬁned as those with RPKM
(reads per kilobase of exon per million mapped reads,
Mortazavi et al., 2008) >10. This criterion follows the classiﬁca-
tion in four gene groups used in Valouev et al. (2011). The gene
expression data used here come from the same CD4+T cells as
those used to assay the nucleosomes (V alouev et al., 2011), avail-
able on GEO, accession number GSE25133. To account for miss-
ing predictions, nucleosomes are enumerated from the TSS to the
3’ end of the 1kb window, without constraining them to be con-
secutive, and a linear model is used to ﬁnd optimal numbering.

From the inter-nucleosome distances estimated at 2754 highly
expressed genes, the mean and standard deviation are computed
for each method (Table 3). Substantial differences are found
across methods where, taking Valouev et al. (2011) value of nu-
cleosome spacing as a reference (182 bp), K-means and
TemplateFilter result in an under-estimation of ~20 bp and
~10 bp, respectively, unlike NPS and NucleoFinder that provide
improved estimations. In addition to being biased, K-means re-
sults in a standard deviation almost twice as large as those found
in the other methods, indicating that this method perform poorly
both in term of accuracy and precision.

3.3 Ability to recover nucleosome-speciﬁc dinucleotides

The relationship between nucleosome position and DNA se-
quence has been the subject of intense research (Field et al.,
2008; Peckham et al., 2007; Tillo et al., 2010; Valouev et al.,
2011; Yuan and Liu, 2008), which has revealed that, owing to
their poor distortion properties, poly-dA/dT sequences result in
nucleosome exclusion, whereas sequences with 10 bp periodicity
of AA/TT/TA dinucleotides facilitate the sharp bending of DNA
around the nucleosome (Anselmi et al., 1999). In human,
Valouev et al. (2011) demonstrated that in vitro, the centre of
well-positioned nucleosomes is characterized by an enrichment of
G/C motifs and a depletion of A/T motifs.

This information can be used to compare methods, where a
large discrepancy between GC and AT frequencies at the centre
of nucleosome predictions in vitro will suggest a high speciﬁcity

deviation)

of the considered method for well-positioned nucleosomes. To
quantify this pattern, we measure the difference between the GC
and AA/TT frequencies at the centre of nucleosomes predicted in
chromosome 22. To account for the two-fold symmetry axis of
the nucleosome structure (Richmond and Davey, 2003), the GC
and AA/TT frequencies are calculated from both the sense and
antisense sequences associated with the predictions. 95% conﬁ-

centile of the chi-square distribution with 1 degree of freedom, n
the number of sequences used for the estimation of f,- and m the
number of dinucleotides (Goodman, 1965).

Consistently with their role in promoting or repelling nucleo-
some, AA/TT and GC frequencies display U-like and bell-like
shapes in the four methods (Fig. 2). This pattern is more or less
pronounced across methods, as reﬂected by the values of A that
vary from 0.0024 (0.0018—0.0030) for K-means to 0.0037
(0.0028—0.0046) for NucleoFinder. When looking at the conﬁ-
dence intervals associated with the four methods, it can be
noticed that they all overlap (Fig. 2), implying that none of
these methods signiﬁcantly outperform the others. However,
the larger values found in NPS and NucleoFinder support the
idea that these two approaches have a greater ability to detect
well-positioned nucleosomes.

4 DISCUSSION

The recent development of high-throughput sequencing methods
has provided a global insight into how the combination of nu-
cleosome positions and their post-transcriptional modiﬁcations
are key to gene regulation. The precise identiﬁcation of nucleo-
somes is therefore crucial to understanding what determines the
nucleosome architecture and how changes in this organization
induce variation in gene expression. This task is made non-trivial
by the fact that nucleosomes are assayed across cell populations
and consequently result in complex patterns of reads. Another
difﬁculty also arises from the known bias of MNase toward
AT/TA motifs, which potentially can limit the accuracy of nu-
cleosome detection. From our knowledge, no existing
MNase-Seq methods have addressed this issue. To ﬁll this gap,

Nucleosome position

we introduce NucleoFinder, which looks for regions having both
a high level of nucleosome positioning and a signiﬁcant nucleo-
some enrichment relative to a control sample.

Despite the absence of large scale regions consistently popu-
lated by nucleosomes that could be used for methods compari-
son, we demonstrated that NucleoFinder is robust to outliers
and generates fewer false positives than the other methods. We
further showed that NucleoFinder captures important features of
the nucleosome organization to an equal or greater extent than
the other methods: (i) the estimation of nucleosome spacing from
its in vivo predictions was consistent with Valouev et al. (2011),
and (ii) the characteristic G/C-rich and A/T-depleted signals at
the centre of in vitro nucleosomes was more pronounced at
NucleoFinder predictions.

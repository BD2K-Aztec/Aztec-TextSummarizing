ABSTRACT

Summary: Kalign2 is one of the fastest and most accurate methods
for multiple alignments. However, in contrast to other methods
Kalign2 does not allow externally supplied position specific gap
penalties. Here, we present a modification to Kalign2, KalignP, so
that it accepts such penalties. Further, we show that KalignP using
position specific gap penalties obtained from predicted secondary
structures makes steady improvement over Kalign2 when tested on
Balibase 3.0 as well as on a dataset derived from Pfam-A seed
alignments.

1 INTRODUCTION

The alignment of multiple sequences is essential for many tasks
in sequence analysis, e. g. protein structure and function prediction,
similarity search and phylogenetic analysis (Pei, 2008). Due to the
importance of multiple sequence alignment (MSA) in a variety of
biological applications, a number of programs have been developed.
Three aspects are usually considered when developing an MSA
program, the alignment accuracy, the computational speed and the
memory usage. Kalign2 (Lassmann et al., 2009) is one of the fastest
MSA methods, and still the alignment accuracy is comparable to
many of the slower methods. Moreover, it produces high quality
alignments consistently when aligning large number of sequences,
i.e. Kalign2 is well suited for MSA tasks in large-scale genome
analysis.

However, in contrast to other methods such as
ClustalW (Thompson et al., 1994), Kalign2 does not allow
externally supplied position speciﬁc gap penalties (ESPSGP).
Thompson et al. (1994) showed that gaps occur far more often
between major secondary structure elements than within. Also
gaps are much more frequent in disordered regions of proteins. For
integral transmembrane (TM) proteins, residues are more conserved
at TM regions and few gaps are allowed within (Kauko et al., 2008).

Further, the inclusion of ESPS GP allows some inclusion of expertise
knowledge into the alignment procedure.

Here, we introduce KalignP as a modiﬁed version of Kalign2
that accepts ESPSGP. Unlike ClustalW, where ESPSGP is only
applicable to proﬁle alignments, KalignP incorporates ESPSGP into
sequences and forward them to the full progressive alignment.

2 METHODS

2.1 Implementation of KalignP

KalignP inherits the syntax of Kalign2 but extends its functionality for protein
sequence alignment. The ESPSGP can be supplied in the Enhanced Fasta
format (see Supplementary Material) so that gap penalties are set individually
for each position. The default gap penalties will be replaced by ESPSGP
when aligning two single sequences. Gap penalties of proﬁles (consensus
of sequences) are calculated in the same way as Kalign2 but ESPSGP will
be used instead of the constant gap penalty. KalignP also inherits one of the
best merits of Kalign2: low memory consumption. Since KalignP uses the
same progressive method as Kalign2, it consumes almost the same amount
of memory as Kalign2. KalignP takes about 50% more CPU time than
Kalign2 for the alignment itself. The KalignP package, including automatic
secondary structure prediction and ESPSGP calculation from secondary
structures predicted by PSIPRED_single (Jones, 1999) (version 3.2), is about
15 times slower than Kalign2, but this speed is still comparable to many other
MSA programs such as ClustalW and Muscle (Edgar, 2004), see Table 1 and
Supplementary Material.

2.2 Estimation of ESPSGP from predicted secondary
structure
The principle to estimate ESPSGP from the predicted secondary structure is

simple: increase the gap penalty at helices and sheets while lowering the gap
penalty at coils. ESPSGP for position i is set as

ESPSGP(i) = GPdefauh * (1.0 +m(i)) (1)

where m(i) is a variable to adjust the gap penalty at residue i based on the
predicted structural information, see Supplementary Material for details.

3 RESULTS

We benchmarked KalignP using gap penalties from predicted
secondary structure with other methods on Balibase 3.0. KalignP
outperformed Kalign2 on all ﬁve reference-sets (Table 1). The
results were evaluated by SF (Sum-of—Pairs) score and TC (Total
Columns) score (Thompson et al., 2005). SP score is the sum
of scores of the projected pairwise alignments and TC score is
the sum of scores of each column for a multiple alignment. The
P-Values of paired t-test of all 386 alignments in Balibase 3.0 are

4.51e—5 and 0.0167 for SP and TC scores, respectively, with the
alternative hypothesis that true difference in the means of Kalign2
and KalignP is less than 0. The paired t-test was performed by R.
Here, KalignP were optimized on Balibase 3.0 using a 3-fold cross-
Validation (see Supplementary Material). The largest improvement
was made on RV50 (for proteins with insertions) where KalignP
made a 2.0% improvement for SP score and 2.4% for TC score
(see Supplementary Table S 1). Only two methods in the benchmark
outperformed KalignP, T_coffee (Notredame et al., 2000) and
Probcons (Do et al., 2005) but these methods are much slower.
Note that the speed of KalignP for alignment alone is comparable
to Kalign2. However, including the time for secondary structure
prediction and ESPSGP calculation it is slower but still comparable
to ClustalW and Muscle (Edgar, 2004).

KalignP made a steady improvement on the alignment of TM
proteins as well. As shown in the benchmark on ref7 (for TM
proteins) of Balibase 3 .0, KalignP outperformed Kalign2 by 1.6% for
SP score and 1.8% for TC score (Table 2). However, the signiﬁcance
of the improvement as shown by the t-test is not strong (P-Values
are 0.0623 and 0.278 for SP and TC scores, respectively). This is
most likely because the sample size is too small.

The Balibase 3.0 ref7 contains only eight alignments and the
results for KalignP were obtained by optimizing parameters on
all these alignments. Therefore, over-training might be an issue
here. To test the robustness of KalignP on the alignment of TM
proteins, we created another reference dataset PfamA-mem which
was derived from Pfam—A (version 24.0) seed alignments and ﬁltered
by matching the key word ‘transmembrane’ in the ‘DE’ record. The
same parameters optimized from ref7 were used to test these 51
alignments in PfamA—mem (see Supplementary Table S3 for a list
of these 51 Pfam—A alignments). A similar improvement of KalignP
over Kalign2 was obtained (Table 2). The P-Values for paired t-test
are 2.75e-4 and 3.85e-3 for SP and TC scores, respectively.

4 CONCLUSIONS

Here, we present KalignP, a method that allows externally supplied
position speciﬁc gap penalty, and maintains the high speed and
accuracy of Kalign2. Using gap-penalties from predicted secondary
structures a steady improvement is seen. Further, KalignP is more
ﬂexible than Kalign2, as researchers can modify the behavior of
alignment using other knowledge.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Most integral membrane proteins form dimeric or oligo-
meric complexes. Oligomerization is frequently supported by the non-
covalent interaction of transmembrane helices. It is currently not clear
how many high-affinity transmembrane domains (T MD) exist in a
proteome and how specific their interactions are with respect to pre-
ferred contacting faces and their underlying residue motifs.

Results: We first identify a threshold of 55% sequence similarity,
which demarcates the border between meaningful alignments of
TMDs and chance alignments. Clustering the human single-span
membrane proteome using this threshold groups ~40% of the
TMDs. The homotypic interaction of the TMDs representing the 33
largest clusters was systematically investigated under standardized
conditions. The results reveal a broad distribution of relative affinities.
High relative affinity frequently coincides with (i) the existence of a
preferred helix—helix interface and (ii) sequence specificity as indicated
by reduced affinity after mutating conserved residues.

1 INTRODUCTION

Most integral membrane proteins assemble to non-covalent func-
tional oligomers. This Oligomerization is frequently supported by
interactions of their or—helical transmembrane domains (TMDs)
(Arbely and Arkin, 2004; Cymer et al., 2012; Popot and
Engelman, 2000; Rath and Deber, 2008; Senes et al., 2004). On
the one hand, their association is favored by the constraints of
the lipid bilayer, which concentrates and pre-orients the proteins
(Grasberger et al., 1986). On the other hand, TMD—TMD inter-
actions frequently depend on recurrent interfacial amino acid
motifs. For example, the TMD helix—helix interface of
Glycophorin A (GpA) contains a critical GxxxG motif, which
also promotes close association of many other helices (Arbely
and Arkin, 2004; MacKenzie et al., 1997; Smith et al., 2001).

In some cases, variations of GxxxG, the G/A/ SxxxG/A/ S
motifs (Rath and Deber, 2008; Senes et al., 2004), are crucial,
as in ErbB receptors (Cymer and Schneider, 2010; Cymer et al.,
2012) and integrins (Luo and Springer, 2006; Schneider and
Engelman, 2004). These motifs can cooperate with polar or aro-
matic amino acids within the same TMD (Herrmann et al., 2010;
Unterreitmeier et al., 2007), which makes them dependent on
sequence context. Self-interaction of other TMDs is driven by
S/T (Dawson et al., 2002), QxxW motifs (Sal-Man et al., 2004),
aromatic residues (Johnson et al., 2007; Ridder et al., 2005) or by
residues with carboxamide side chains (Laage and Langosch,
1997). TMD—TMD interactions have been studied most intensely
with single-span membrane proteins that account for a substan-
tial fraction of membrane proteins that increases from ~15% in
bacteria to >40% in humans Morch et al., 2010). To date,
dozens of single-span proteins are known to interact via their
TMDs, and about one dozen of high-resolution structures have
been published that reveal distinct helix—helix interfaces in struc-
tural detail reviewed in (Cymer et al., 2012).

It is currently unclear which fraction of the >3000 predicted
single-span membrane proteins self-assemble via TMD—TMD
interactions. Further, it is not known whether strongly interact-
ing TMDs generally exhibit distinct interfaces. It is likely that
some interacting helices exhibit multiple interfaces depending on
the functional state of the protein. Alternative interfaces may
interchange by rotation (Seubert et al., 2003) or by interaction
of N-terminal versus C-terminal parts (Arkhipov et al., 2013;
Escher et al., 2009). In addition, many TM helices exhibit uni-
lateral residue conservation (Ried et al., 2012; Zviling et al.,
2007). To which extent these interactions are based on conserved
amino acid motifs, such as G/A/SxxxG/A/S, has also been
debated (Li et al., 2012).

Here, we approached these issues in a systematic way by iden-
tifying TMDs that represent clusters of homologous sequences
and by experimentally characterizing their self-interaction. To
this end, we clustered the human single-span membrane prote-
ome based on pairwise alignments of TMDs, using a meaningful
sequence similarity threshold derived in this study. Analyzing the
self-interaction of the TMDs representing each major cluster re-
vealed a broad distribution of relative afﬁnities. In a number of
high-afﬁnity TMDs, mutational analyses confirmed the sequence
specificity of the self-interaction. Although the majority of

clusters reﬂect the divergent evolution of duplicated and thus
functionally related proteins, other clusters may have arisen by
convergent evolution of interacting TMDs within structurally
and functionally otherwise unrelated proteins.

2 METHODS

A database of human single-span membrane proteins was created from
the UniProtKB database (UniProt Consortium, 2008) (release 57.9,
October 2009), by selecting all human proteins annotated as ‘single-
pass membrane protein’. The TMDs and signal peptides were predicted
using Phobius (Kall et al., 2004) (version 1.01), but only proteins con-
taining one TMD were selected for further analysis. From the resulting
dataset of 3534 single-span membrane proteins, the TMD sequences were
extracted. Only unique TMDs were retained, yielding a database of 2205
distinct TMD sequences.

The ‘water’ application from the EMBOSS package (Rice 61 al., 2000)
performed pairwise gapless alignments of TMDs and calculated pairwise
Smith—Waterman bit scores (Smith and Waterman, 1981) between TMD
sequences using the PHAT substitution matrix (N g at al., 2000) generated
for TMDs. The following parameters were used: gapopen = 100.00,
gapextend = 10.00, dataﬁle = PHAT7573, aforrnat 2 score. By repeating
the procedure for each sequence in the dataset, a matrix of all-against—all
pairwise bit scores was obtained. The entire score matrix was normalized
for TMD length by dividing the scores by their corresponding self-scores
according to Equation (1).

Ssl,s2 ‘1‘ 552,51
S51 ‘1‘ S52

5,1332 and SS2,“ are the bidirectional bit scores of TMD 1 against TMD
2 and vice versa. SS] and Ssg are the bit scores of TMDs 1 and 2 against
themselves. ssrslﬁg represents the score/selfscore ratio (ssr) of TMD 1
against TMD 2 in percentage. To identify a meaningful similarity thresh-
old for clustering, we compared the similarities of the TMD sequences in
the database (ssrnatural) with the similarities of their randomized counter-
parts (ssrrandom). By comparing the distributions of values of ssrmnd0m
and ssrnatural, a homology threshold of ssr = 55% was identiﬁed.

Clusters of TMDs that share 255% homology were built by searching
the ssr matrix, whose order follows the appearance of proteins in the
UniProtKB. The TMD with the largest number of hits was retrieved
from our database together with its homologs and corresponds to the
‘most representative” TMD sequence of the ﬁrst cluster. The procedure
was repeated on the reduced database until no further similarities 25 5%
could be found.

The ToxR system (Langosch et al., 1996) was used to measure self-
interaction of TMDs. TMD sequences, which had a ﬁxed length of 20
amino acids for better comparability, were introduced into the ToxR
chimeric protein by ligation of respective oligonucleotide cassettes be-
tween the NheI and BamHI sites of the pToxRV plasmid. All TMDs
were introduced in four helical registers to determine the orientation de-
pendence of the signal. Point mutations were introduced using the
QuikChange® Site-Directed Mutagenesis Kit (Agilent Technologies,
Waldbronn, Germany). TMD self-interaction was determined as
described previously using 0.0025% (w/v) L-arabinose (Sigma-Aldrich,
Steinheim, Germany) to induce expression and adding 0.4 mM
Isoprenyl—1-thio-B-D-galactopyranoside (AppliChem, Darmstadt,
Germany) (Gurezka et al., 1999). A minimum of three replicates done
in quadruplicate was performed for each construct.

The ToxR protein expression and efﬁciency of membrane integration
was tested by complementing the MalE deﬁciency of Escherichia coli
PD28 cells as described previously (Brosig and Langosch, 1998).
Transformed PD28 cells were grown in minimal medium including
0.4% maltose (AppliChem, Darmstadt, Germany) as sole carbon
source. OD600 was measured after 20—24h and compared with the

construct, which contains the TMD of GpA. ToxR proteins were con-
sidered sufﬁciently expressed and correctly integrated into the membrane
when the slope of the growth curve was at least 50% of that of human
GpA.

3 RESULTS

In the initial part of this study, our goal was to identify paradig-
matic TMDs that would represent clusters of homologs and thus
cover a signiﬁcant part of the single-span membrane proteome.
These representative TMDs were subsequently investigated for
self-interaction.

3.1 TMD-based clustering of human single-span
membrane proteins

As the level of sequence homology at which TMDs could be
clustered was not known, we ﬁrst identiﬁed a meaningful hom-
ology threshold. By performing all-against—all pairwise TMD
alignments, we calculated score/selfscore ratios (ssr), which re-
ﬁect the similarity between any two human TMD sequences (see
Section 2 for details). The distribution of these ssrnatural values
was compared with the distribution of ssrrand0m values obtained
by aligning the same TMD pairs after sequence randomization
(Fig. l). The obtained ssrrand0m reﬂect chance homology, which
peaks ~l7%. Both distributions signiﬁcantly differ at high ssr
values where alignments of natural TMDs are more frequent
than chance alignments. Above a similarity threshold of
ssr=55%, alignments of natural TMD pairs are :20 times
more abundant than those of randomized TMD pairs. In other
words, the probability of aligning the average natural TMD pair
at random above the 55% homology threshold is 35%.
Clustering the entire TMD database based on the similarity
threshold of 55% groups 40.5% of the 2205 predicted human
single-span protein TMDs into 278 clusters. 33 ‘top’ clusters
(Cl—C3, C5—C3l and C33—C35) include :5 TMDS, each, and
cover 13.5% of the human single-span proteome (Table l)

members. Bold amino acids were selected for mutation analysis. Underlined G/A/SxxxG/A/S motifs are present in 260% of the members.

(We note that C4 and C32 members were re—annotated in
UniProtKB as soluble in the course of this study and thus
excluded here). Each cluster contains one most representative
TMD, which is similar (ssr 255%) to all other members. Most
(20/33) top clusters (Cl—C3, C9, C10, C12, C14—C16, C18, C20—
C22, C24—C29 and C33) contain mainly proteins of similar bio-
logical function according to the respective annotation in
UniProtKB (UniProt Consortium, 2008) and are thus designated
‘functionally homogeneous’. By contrast, >40% of the members
of the top clusters C5—C8, C11, C13, C17, C19, C23, C30, C31,
C34 and C35 have functions that deviate from the most prevalent
function and are thus designated “functionally heterogeneous’
(Table 1).

To compare our TMD-based clustering to the more traditional
approach of using complete sequences, we extended the clusters
by including alignments between the complete sequences of the

representative proteins and previously not clustered single-span
proteins using a homology threshold of 25%. A sequence con-
servation level of 25% signiﬁes structural homology of soluble
proteins as shown by analyses of X-ray structures (Rost, 1999).
This procedure increased the fraction of clustered proteins from
40.5 to 51.9%. This small increase in coverage provides support
to the efﬁciency of our TMD-based clustering.

3.2 Homology and functional diversity

To explore the relationship between sequence homology and
functional diversity within our clusters, we calculated pairwise
ssr values at the level of TMD (ssrTMD) and complete sequences
(ssrcomplete) between cluster members and their respective
most representative sequences. The distribution of the
ssrTMD/ssrcmmﬂete ratios shows roughly two major populations

Fig. 2. Comparing TMD similarity to complete sequence similarity.
Pairwise alignments of TMDs from cluster members to their respective
most representative TMD sequences were used to calculate TMD simila-
rities for each cluster (ssrTMD). Similarly, the corresponding complete
protein similarities (ssrcomplete) were calculated. If a TMD is more similar
to the representative TMD than is the complete protein sequence, the
ssrTMD/ssrcomplete ratio is >1. The distributions of these ratios were com-
pared for all 298 clusters, the 33 top clusters and the subset of functionally
heterogeneous top clusters. Bars are superimposed, i.e. their heights are
non-cumulative. The higher abundance of ssrTMD/ssrcmnplete >2.5 within
functionally heterogeneous clusters indicates a much higher TMD simi-
larity relative to complete sequence similarity in this subset

of proteins (Fig. 2). Proteins where the homologies of TMDs and
complete sequences are relatively similar (ssrTMD/ssrcomplete < 2.5)
are clearly separated from those proteins where the complete
sequences are much more diverse than the TMDs (ssrTMD/ssrcom_
plate > 2.5). These distributions are compared for all clusters, our
top clusters and for functionally heterogeneous top clusters.
Interestingly, most members of functionally heterogeneous clus-
ters are more homologous at the level of the TMDs than at the
level of the complete sequence. Further, members of functionally
heterogeneous clusters are less similar at the level of complete
sequence (ssrcomplete = 13.6%) than functionally homogeneous
clusters (ssrcompletez 38.8%), which is below or above the 25%
threshold, respectively, which signiﬁes structural homology
(Rost, 1999). As the complete sequences are mostly extramem—
branous, the latter tend to fold into 3D structures that are similar
between the members of functionally homogeneous clusters but
dissimilar within functionally homogeneous clusters. By contrast,
the TMDs are rather similar (ssrTMD = 62.2% for heterogeneous
and ssrTMD = 71.3% for homogeneous clusters).

3.3 Abundance of potential TMD—TMD interaction
motifs

Clustered TMDs were searched for amino acid patterns that are
implicated in TMD—TMD interaction (Table 1). Indeed, single
or multiple GxxxG or GxxxA motifs were found twice as often in
clustered TMDs (22.6%) compared with non-clustered TMDs
(11.6%). In contrast, the abundance of G/A/SxxxG/A/S motifs
is nearly independent of clustering (64.1% in clusters, 56.7% in
non-clustered sequences). In 10 top clusters (C2, C5, C7, C11,
C12, C17, C20, C28, C30 and C35), the GxxxG motif is con-
served in at least 60% of their members. The functionally het-
erogeneous top clusters exhibit a ~2-fold enrichment of GxxxG,

AxxxG and SxxxG motifs compared with functionally
homogeneous top clusters (Table 1). Taken together, certain
G/A/SxxxG/A/S motifs are enriched within the clustered TMDs
and in particular in those of functionally heterogeneous clusters.

3.4 Homotypic interaction of the most representative
TMDs

The representative TMDs from the 33 top clusters were now
tested for self-interaction in a biological membrane using the
ToxR assay. Self-interaction of a ToxR/TMD/MalE hybrid pro-
tein at the level of its TMD in a bacterial membrane drives tran-
scription of the lacZ gene that is under control of the ctx
promoter (Langosch et al., 1996). Afﬁnities were determined rela-
tive to the high-afﬁnity GpA TMD and its weakly interacting
mutant G83A that is thought to produce a non-speciﬁc back-
ground signal (Langosch et al., 1996) and to the medium-afﬁnity
AZ2 leucine zipper (Gurezka et al., 1999). We initially determined
the optimal orientation of the potentially interacting faces of the
TMDs relative to the DNA-binding ToxR domain. Assuming
oz-helicity of the TMDS, stepwise insertion of three additional
residues at their N-terminus concurrent with the stepwise deletion
of three residues at their C-termini rotates the potential TMD—
T MD interfaces by up to 3 x 100, i.e. ahnost a full helix turn,
relative to the ToxR domain. The differences between the B-Gal
activities elicited by different constructs (Supplementary Table
S1) indicate the extent to which self-interaction requires a speciﬁc
interface, which is given by the ‘orientation—dependence’. Six
TMDs (C5, C11, C12, C15, C26 and C28) exhibit a clear prefer-
ence for a particular TMD orientation (Fig. 3A, ‘strongly orien-
tation-dependent’, indicated by dark shading). Another nine
TMDs (C6—C8, C10, C19 and C21—C24) show little dependence
on orientation (‘weakly orientation-dependent’, indicated by light
shading). The other tested TMDs are nearly independent of orien-
tation (‘not orientation-dependent’, without shading).
Interestingly, four/six strongly orientation-dependent TMDs
(C5, C11, C12 and C28) contain a GxxxG motif conserved in
at least 60% of their homologs. In contrast, only 6/26 weakly
or not orientation-dependent TMDs (C2, C7, C17, C20, C30
and C35) share this pattern. Therefore, orientation-dependent
TMDs tend to contain conserved GxxxG motifs.

Comparing the relative afﬁnities of TMDs in their optimal
orientation reveals a broad range (Fig. 3B). Notably, high afﬁnity
TMDs tend to be orientation-dependent (Spearman’s correlation
test, p=0.48, P=0.005). To examine whether the relative afﬁ-
nities of TMDs are conserved within clusters, we selected eight
clusters (C3, C7—C9, C12, C15, C30 and C31) of different inter-
action strength, functional diversity and GxxxG content
(Supplementary Table S2). From each of these clusters, the self-
interaction of 2—5 TMDs was determined. In six/eight chosen
clusters (C3, C7—C9, C12 and C31), the relative afﬁnity was com-
parable (:I:20%) to the most representative sequences
(Supplementary Fig. S1), suggesting that the afﬁnities tend to be
conserved within the clusters. In the remaining clusters, the hom-
ology might mainly result from non-interfacial residue positions.

Finally, 12 representative TMDs were mutated to assess the
sequence-speciﬁcity of self-interaction. The mutations target
mainly G/A/SxxxG/A/S motifs and other highly conserved
amino acids (Table 1, bold type). Depending on the TMD and

ToxR system [dot: median, box: interquartile range (IQR), whiskers: upper/lower quartile with max. 1.5 X IQR]. (A) Dependence of the B-Gal signal on
the orientation of the TMD relative to the ToxR domain. The scheme at the top shows the stepwise insertion of three additional residues at a TMDs’
N—terminus concurrent with the stepwise deletion of three residues at its C-terminus, which rotates the potential TMD—TMD interface by up to 3 X 100.
The results are sorted according to the orientation dependence of the signal to structure the results. The different orientations of six TMDs show >40%
difference in relative B-Gal activity, which is considered as strong orientation-dependence (dark shading), nine TMDs show weak orientation dependence
with 20—40% difference in relative B-Gal activity (light shading), whereas the signal elicited by 17 TMDs is unaffected by orientation (no shading).

spective top clusters (Table 1) among most representative TMDs
(Fig. 3B). Strong self-interaction (>AZ2 reference TMD) is often accom-
panied by orientation dependence and mutation sensitivity. Functionally
heterogeneous clusters are enriched in conserved GxxxG motifs. Not all
representative TMDs have been investigated to mutational analysis

note that mutation sensitivity is technically more difﬁcult to
establish for low-afﬁnity TMDs, which exhibit B—Gal signals
close to the low-afﬁnity GpA G83A.

For control, each construct was tested for its proper insertion
into the inner bacterial membrane by determining its ability to
complement the MalE deﬁciency of E.coli PD28 cells; this strain
lacks endogenous MalE and its growth in minimal medium
with maltose as the only carbon source depends on correctly
inserted ToxR/TMD/MalE hybrid proteins (see Section 2 and
Supplementary Figs S2—S5). Different constructs elicit slightly
different levels of complementation, which, however, do not
correlate with B-Gal activity (Supplementary Fig. S6). Thus,
normalizing B-Gal activities for slightly varying levels of comple-
mentation is not expected to improve the data. By contrast,
strongly reduced membrane integration, as in the ToxR ATM
negative control, prohibits B-Gal activity, as expected. Cluster

C25 was removed from our dataset because of insufﬁcient mem-
brane integration (Supplementary Fig. S2).

4 DISCUSSION

The objective of this study was to identify TMDs representing a
signiﬁcant fraction of the human single-span membrane prote-
ome and to systematically characterize their homotypic
interactions. Our results have several implications.

First, our comparative analysis of homotypic afﬁnity, which
was done at the same lipid composition and protein density of
the host membrane, shows that the representative TMDs of top
clusters exhibit a broad range of relative afﬁnities. The inter-
action of most high-afﬁnity TMDs depends on preferential
helix—helix interfaces and on conserved residues. In general,
therefore, high relative afﬁnity, existence of a preferred interface
and mutation sensitivity characterize efﬁcient and speciﬁc inter-
action (Fig. 5). On the other hand, there are exceptions to this
rule. Two high-afﬁnity TMDs (C1 and C8) may have multiple,
yet sequence-speciﬁc interfaces. We cannot exclude, however,
that terminal regions of these TMDs unwind to allow re-orien-
tation of ToxR domains into an orientation where they can ac-
tivate transcription. In C1, C8, C12, C15 and C28, mutating
various G/A/SxxxG/A/S motifs or other conserved residues
strongly reduced afﬁnity, whereas no signiﬁcant effect was seen
in other cases (C14 and C16). Thus, some TMD—TMD interfaces
appear to be rather robust, which may be a property that has
been optimized through evolution. The mere presence of GxxxG
or related motifs does not predict self-interaction (Li et al., 2012).

Although homotypic TMD—TMD interactions have been
demonstrated previously for members of some high-afﬁnity clus-
ters, e. g. for protocadherins (Cl) (Chen et al., 2007) and integrin
or chains (C5 and C16) (Li et al., 2001; Li et al., 2004), a second
outcome of this study is that it uncovers novel self-interacting

Self-interaction of human transmembrane helices

 

TMDs. These include TMDs of sialic-acid-binding Ig (C15), ar-
madillo repeat-containing proteins (C28), HLA class II a chains
(C12) and others (Supplementary Table S1). The afﬁnity of 12
TMDs is close to that of the structurally well-characterized high-
afﬁnity GpA dimer (Fig. 5). These TMDs represent a total of 124
TMDs homologous to them which equals 5.6% of sequence
space. As they are likely to represent a similar percentage of
structure space, they may be regarded as paradigmatic targets
for future structure analysis. In some cases, self-interaction may
parallel functionally relevant heterotypic interaction. For ex-
ample, HLA class II or (C12) and [3 (C20) chains are known
for heterotypic interaction via extramembraneous domains
(Germain, 1995; Schafer et al., 1995), which could be supported
by the TMDs. The TMDs of integrin a (C5 and C16) and [3 (C7)
chains also support heterodimerization (Berger et al., 2010; Lau
et al., 2009), whereas the functional relevance of their homotypic
interactions (Berger et al., 2010; Li et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003; Li
et al., 2004; Schneider and Engelman, 2004) is unclear (\Nang
et al., 2011). The homotypic interactions of several tested TMDs
are rather inefﬁcient, although some of them may be functionally
important, as in cadherins (C3) (Huber et al., 1999), integrin [3
chains (C7) (Li et al., 2001; Li et al., 2003), syntaxin (C13)
(Hofmann et al., 2006; Laage et al., 2000) and synaptobrevins
(C26) (Tong et al., 2009). It should be borne in mind that low
afﬁnity detected under our standardized conditions does not ex-
clude efﬁcient TMD-based self-interaction of proteins that are
present at high concentration. In addition, the lipid composition
of the relevant host membrane may affect afﬁnity.

Third, 90/265 pairwise TMD alignments within the top clusters
suggest relationships between TMDs that belong to proteins
being apparently unrelated in function. Part of these alignments
might result from random homology. In other cases, TMD-based
clustering of functionally unrelated proteins could reﬂect conver-
gent evolution of their TMDs, despite dissimilar soluble domains.
Interestingly, these TMDs are enriched in GxxxG, AxxxG and
SxxxG motifs relative to the TMDs of functionally homogeneous
clusters. Further, GxxxG motifs are conserved in TMDs of 6/ 13
functionally heterogeneous clusters but only in the TMDs of 4/20
functionally homogeneous clusters (Fig. 5). This might indicate
that TMDs of functionally unrelated proteins tend to converge
toward G/A/SxxxG/A/S-based interaction motifs. The evolution
of such short interaction motifs requires fewer mutations than
that of more complex helix—helix interfaces, and they could there-
fore develop rather rapidly by convergent evolution. In addition
to homotypic TMD—TMD interaction, the conservation of TMD
sequences within the functionally heterogeneous clusters could
reﬂect conserved heterotypic interaction, interaction with lipids
and/or binding of co-factors.

Finally, the homology threshold of 55% may be useful when
aligning membrane proteins for homology-based structure
modeling, especially for proteins that mainly consist of TMDs.
It must be borne in mind, however, that the threshold may be
different for multi-span proteins.

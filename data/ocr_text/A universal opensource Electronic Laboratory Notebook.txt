ABSTRACT

Motivation: Laboratory notebooks remain crucial to the activities of
research communities. With the increase in generation of electronic
data within both wet and dry analytical laboratories and new technolo-
gies providing more efficient means of communication, Electronic
Laboratory Notebooks (ELN) offer equivalent record keeping to
paper-based laboratory notebooks (PLN). They additionally allow
more efficient mechanisms for data sharing and retrieval, which
explains the growing number of commercial ELNs available varying in
size and scope but all are increasingly accepted and used by the sci-
entific community. The International Agency for Research on Cancer
(IARC) having already an LIMS and a Biobank Management System for
respectively laboratory workflows and sample management, we have
developed a free multidisciplinary ELN specifically dedicated to work
notes that will be flexible enough to accommodate different types of
data.

Availability and implementation: Information for installation of
our freeware ELN with source codes customizations are detailed in
supplementary data.

Bioinformatics online.

1 INTRODUCTION

The requirements for the development of International Agency
for Research on Cancer (IARC) Electronic Laboratory
Notebooks (ELN) consisted of integrating all the features existing
in the paper-based laboratory notebooks (PLN) together with
additional functionalities to enable easy and intuitive navigation
and information search capacities upon the notebooks WVright,
2009), following the deﬁnition of the Collaborative Electronic
Notebook Systems Association: ‘System to create, store, retrieve
and share fully electronic records in ways that meet all legal, regu-
latory, technical and scientiﬁc requirements; records being collec-
tions of information or data associated with an experiment to
enable a suitably skilled person to repeat it’. The speciﬁcations
included (i) recording of experimental data in a ﬂexible way
through a common platform suitable for the various research
activities of the institute, and at the same time maintaining the
rigorous scientiﬁc practices required for day-to-day notekeeping

(traceability of each single modiﬁcation), all within a highly
secure environment; (ii) improving lab efﬁciency and work prod-
uctivity by facilitating protocol and data sharing, record keeping,
particularly in terms of limiting repetitive tasks; (iii) providing an
efﬁcient means by which to search archived material; (iv) being
free, open-source and web based requiring no installation of
software on user’s computer; and ﬁnally (v) enabling long-term
and secure storage in basic electronic format (text).

2 METHODS

Based on these speciﬁcations, we have tested several tools (of.
Supplementary Material) and ﬁnally chose WordPress 3.4.1 with
Atahualpa 3.7.6. theme. WordPress is a modern well adopted Content
Management System (CMS), easy to design and to customize, written in
PHP and based on a MySQL database. This user friendly open-source
publishing software was found to ﬁt the best the Agency’s needs mainly
because it enables the set-up of multi-users with tight access controls and
provides a lot of options for customization.

A simple Linux server hosts both the web application and the data-
base. A large number of free plugins offering different functionalities have
been tested to ﬁnd the most adapted ones (cf. Supplementary Material).
The system is currently being developed, maintained and administrated
by an IT developer and a bioinformatician.

The correspondence between the CMS terminology and the laboratory
notebook has been set up as following: categories are equivalent to note-
books or groups of notebooks, posts are equivalent to pages and com-
ments to annotations.

3 RESULTS

ELNs provide signiﬁcant advantages over PLNs. Data can be
quickly entered, retrieved, located, shared and are easy to archive
and backup; data including text, images, attached documents,
links. An ELN can belong to one single person or be shared
within and/or between research groups when being speciﬁc to
one common project or one instrument or equipment (for ex-
ample, for maintenance follow-up and troubleshooting issues). It
can be used for proposal developments, meetings notes as well as
centrally updated manuals or SOPs.

We will detail in the following chapters and also in the
Supplementary Material how we managed to fulﬁll all the re-
quirements and rules of a PLN (*) and the additional features
making the ELN a far better alternative to PLN.

3.1 Access

The tool developed is entirely web based and therefore access-
ible through any web browser connected to the internal

ﬁrewall-protected network, making it accessible from both
laboratories and ofﬁces. The access is controlled by personal
login and password (notably thanks to the ‘Login conﬁgurator’
plugin). The IARC ELN is compatible with PC, Mac, tablets
and smartphones. The access to data in reading and editing is
deﬁned very precisely and controlled by speciﬁc user permissions
thanks to the ‘Role Scoper’ plugin (from completely private to
public). The system offers the option for some notebooks to have
more than one author or to be read only.

By default we put in place a 3—workspaces design for each
research group in the Agency:

— ‘group workspace’ dedicated to personal notebooks and
containing one sub-workspace for each member of the
group, each sub-workspace containing one or more note-
books (each member of the group has write access to his
own notebook and read access to the other members
notebooks).

— ‘share workspace’ containing notebooks for instruments,
robots or shared projects (with read and write access for
the whole group).

— ‘archives workspace’ containing all closed and archived
notebooks of staff who have left the Agency (set to
read-only access).

— The users are offered the possibility to leave comments on
all the notebooks that they have read access to.

3.2 Features

Our ELN system includes the following main functionalities:

— Easy to navigate interface and menus providing access
to all users irrespective of their informatics skills - cf.
Fig. 1 (thanks to widgets, custom code and ‘Collapsing
Categories’ plugin).

— Advanced text editor similar to the well-known ofﬁce
ones and in which speciﬁc templates have been integrated
for laboratory work including ‘Title of experiment, object-
ives, material and methods, results and conclusion’* and

— Insertion and attachment tool for different kind of ﬁles
such as pictures, Word documents, Excel sheets, pdfs,
screenshots, multimedia, hyperlinks (among which cross-
referencing of notebook pages), plots, computer outputs
(which allow incorporation of data from instruments
avoiding printing and pasting into PLN).

— Automatic table of contents* of pages/records providing
the possibility to sort by title or date (customization of
Atahualpa code and ‘WP-PageNavi’ plugin).

— Search tool by keywords (‘Search by Category’ plugin).

— Userstamp and timestamp for each update or annotations
of a page* (recorded by default by WordPress and
displayed by ‘Post Revision Display’ plugin).

— Lists of favorite pages (Customized ‘WP Favorite Posts’
plugin).

— Annotations or comments.

— Post notiﬁcation plugin that enables the user to be warned
by email each time a new post is added into some selected
notebooks (‘Post Notiﬁcation’ plugin with custom code).

— Export to pdf (‘WP—Print’ and ‘Post2PDF Converter’
plugins).

— Management of users permissions by ELN administrators
(‘RoleScoper’ plugin).

3.3 Security

Security is ensured in terms of (i) prevention from scientiﬁc fraud
and protection of intellectual property: the ﬁne-grained access
controls make it more secure than any paper notebook; all
amendments of records are stored in the database; a detailed
documentation describes how to use the ELN, which should
prevent any deviation from the protocol; (ii) longevity: the
html format of the raw data combined with appropriate daily
backups makes it long-lasting and prevented from damage or
deterioration; the ELNs cannot be misplaced, lost or accidently
destroyed; at departure of staff, the ELNs are closed and
archived to read-only status; (iii) protection from external
access (secured server and network, accesses and attempts of
accesses are recorded).

4 CONCLUSION

After 6 months of testing and validation, the ELN accounts for
around 50 regular users, 100 notebooks and over 1300 pages. This
exploratory phase having been a complete success, the Agency has
decided to switch from the PLN to the ELN since 1st of January
2013. As IARC’s LIMS (Voegele, 2007) and IARC’s Biobank
Management System (Voegele, 2010), the IARC ELN has been
largely adopted and is now intensively used within the agency, as
it has proven to bring higher quality documentation, gain of time
for data recording and retrieving as well as higher security. It
should also strengthen collaborations and exchanges between re-
searchers within the Agency. Last but not least it demands very

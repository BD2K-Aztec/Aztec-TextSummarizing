ABSTRACT

Summary: TIBA is a tool to reconstruct phylogenetic trees from re-
arrangement data that consist of ordered lists of synteny blocks (or
genes), where each synteny block is shared with all of its homologues
in the input genomes. The evolution of these synteny blocks, through
rearrangement operations, is modelled by the uniform Double-Cut-
and-Join model. Using a true distance estimate under this model
and simple distance-based methods, TIBA reconstructs a phylogeny
of the input genomes. Unlike any previous tool for inferring phyloge-
nies from rearrangement data, TIBA uses novel methods of robust-
ness estimation to provide support values for the edges in the inferred
tree.

1 INTRODUCTION

‘Rare genomic changes’, such as rearrangements (Rokas and
Holland, 2000), cause large-scale structural changes in the
genome, clarify distant or problematic relationships among or-
ganisms and have been used in many phylogenetic studies.

The ﬁrst algorithm for phylogeny inference from rearrange-
ment data was BPAnalysis (Blanchette et al., 1997). The algo-
rithm seeks to reconstruct the tree and ancestral genomes with
the minimum breakpoint distance along each edge of the tree.
This approach was extended in GRAPPA (Moret et al., 2001)
by using inversion distances. These methods were restricted to
unichromosomal genomes; the tool MGR (Bourque and
Pevzner, 2002) was the ﬁrst to handle multichromosomal gen-
omes. All these parsimony-based approaches must produce good
approximations to the NP-hard problem of computing the rear-
rangement median of three genomes (summarized in Tannier
et al., 2008) which limits their scalability. Despite using clever
heuristics, MGR does not scale well, particularly for high reso-
lution data. Yet to date, MGR [and its more recent derivative
MGRA (Alekseyev and Pevzner, 2009)] had remained the only
tool available for the analysis of multichromosomal genomic
rearrangements.

Distance-based methods like neighbour joining (NJ) (Saitou
and Nei, 1987), in contrast with parsimony-based methods, run
in time polynomial in the number and size of genomes—and fast
and accurate heuristics exist for those where the scoring function
cannot be computed in polynomial time, such as F astME
(Desper and Gascuel, 2004). Pairwise distances, given as input
to a distance-based method, are usually the edit distances, that is,
the minimum-cost distances under the assumed model of evolu-
tion. However, an edit distance typically underestimates the true
distance causing poor accuracy of trees inferred from
distance-based methods. When given true evolutionary distances,
NJ provably returns the true tree. The true evolutionary dis-
tance—the actual number of evolutionary events between the
two genomes—is impossible to measure, but it can be estimated
using statistical techniques. Such distance corrections have long
been used for sequence data and, more recently, for rearrange-
ment data. For multichromosomal genomes, we have designed
such an estimator (Lin and Moret, 2008) and have demonstrated
the accuracy and scalability of a reconstruction method that uses
NJ with this distance estimator (Lin et al., 2011).

A major shortcoming of phylogeny reconstruction from re-
arrangement data has been the lack of any way to assess the
robustness of the inferred edges. In phylogenetic analysis from
sequence data, such an assessment is de rigueur and is carried out
by an adaptation of the standard non-parametric tests—the boot-
strap and the jackknife, ﬁrst proposed by Felsenstein
(F elsenstein, 1985). Recently, we have designed several new meth-
ods for statistically assessing the robustness of trees reconstructed
from rearrangement data (Lin et al., 2011, 2012). Through care-
ful and extensive experiments, we have shown that our bootstrap-
ping approach for rearrangement data is on par with the classic
phylogenetic bootstrap used in sequence-based reconstruction.
Combining these methods with our distance based reconstruction
method, we provide the ﬁrst tool for phylogeny inference from
rearrangement data that is accurate, scalable and provides boot-
strap support values for the edges of the tree.

2 METHODS

Rearrangement data for a genome consists of lists of syntenic blocks
(genes are an example) in the order in which they are placed along one
or more chromosomes. Each syntenic block is identiﬁed by a marker,
which is shared with all (or most) of its homologues in the genomes under
study, and a sign, which represents the strandedness of the syntenic block.
The markers typically used for syntenic blocks are integers. Any two ad-
jacent syntenic blocks can be represented by a set of two integers—we call
this an adjacency. A telomere in a linear chromosome is represented by a

singleton set containing just the end marker. Thus, a genome is repre-
sented by a set of adjacencies and telomeres. Any rearrangement oper-
ation changes up to three adjacencies or telomeres in the genome. For
multichromosomal genomes, all the rearrangement operations can be
modelled by a single operation called ‘Double-Cut-and—Join’ (DCJ)
(Y ancopoulos et al., 2005).

For reconstruction, we use either NJ or FastME. The pairwise dis-
tances used are estimates of the true evolutionary distances under a model
of evolution that assumes uniform distribution of DCJ operations. The
evolutionary model is used to infer an estimate of the true distance by
deriving the effect of a given number of DCJ operations on the number of
shared adjacencies and telomeres and numerically inverting the derivation
to produce a maximum-likelihood estimate of the true distance under the
model. See (Lin and Moret, 2008) for details. Our extensive experiments
on simulated and real datasets, described in (Lin et al., 2011), show that
the error rates of trees reconstructed by NJ using this distance estimator is
<10% in all but the oversaturated cases. With FastME, the error rates are
even lower. Further, error rates are signiﬁcantly reduced by an increase in
the size of the genome—because the larger number of syntenic blocks
reduces the relative error in the estimated distances. Trees can be recon-
structed on up to 500 genomes, each containing up to 10000 markers
within a few seconds on a PC.

As described in (Lin et al., 2012), we design and test several bootstrap-
ping methods that can be used with distance-based reconstruction from
rearrangement data. The fact that our distance estimator computes the
estimated true distance between two genomes based only on the number
of shared adjacencies in each genome allows us to design sampling meth-
ods for bootstrapping that can handle replicate genomes that may be
invalid (e. g. because of additional copies of adjacencies), and yet be suf-
ﬁcient for computing the pairwise distance (by tallying the number of
shared adjacencies). Two of these methods, BC and PJ are equivalent in
their performance and are better than all the other methods designed.
Their names come from their equivalent counterparts in the sequence
world: the classic bootstrap (BC) of Felsenstein and parsimony jackknif-
ing (PJ).

The key idea behind these bootstrapping methods is to create replicates
by sampling adjacencies; from the list of all possible adjacencies, BC
samples with replacement to form a collection of adjacencies; only adja-
cencies in this collection are then used to count the number of shared
adjacencies and then estimate the pairwise distances. PJ is (asymptotic-
ally) equivalent to sampling with replacement (as in BC), but without
overcounting, that is, when sampling gives an adjacency that has been
previously selected, it is not added to the replicate. In other words, se-
lected adjacencies are not counted more than once for computing the
number of shared adjacencies between leaf genomes. From each replicate,
a tree is reconstructed using our true distance estimator and NJ or
FastME. The bootstrap support of an edge (viewed as a bipartition of
leaves) in the inferred tree is the proportion of the trees from replicates
that contain the edge (the same bipartition of leaves). Both BC and PJ
show high sensitivity even at high levels of speciﬁcity, making them ex-
cellent bootstrap methods. We have also demonstrated, in (Lin et al.,
2012), that they outperform jackkniﬁng methods based on sampling mar-
kers, such as (Huang et al., 2010; Shi et al., 2010).

3 SOFTWARE

TIBA is implemented in C++ and can be compiled and executed
on the command line in any UNIX-based platform and in the
Cygwin environment on Windows. To run a phylogenetic ana-
lysis, the program must be run with the following input param-
eters: the input ﬁlename, the output ﬁlename, the reconstruction
method and the bootstrap method. The input ﬁle format is the

same as that used by GRAPPA and MGR; FASTA like headers
for the names of the genomes (‘>’ followed by an alphanumeric
sequence followed by a newline), each chromosome represented
by a signed permutation of integers ending with a ‘$’ symbol and
a newline character. The output ﬁlename provided by the user is
sufﬁxed with ‘_1’ and ‘_2’ to create two output ﬁles, both in
Newick format; the ﬁrst contains the inferred tree with branch
lengths, and the second contains the same inferred tree with sup-
port values replacing the branch lengths. The reconstruction
method can be either NJ or F astME. The two bootstrap methods
discussed earlier in the text are implemented. They can be speci-
ﬁed by ‘BC’ or ‘PJ’. The default number of replicates is 100, but
the user can change this with an additional input. Installation
and usage details, with examples, are provided in the package
and on our website.

4 CONCLUSION

TIBA is fast, scalable, accurate and provides support values for
the edges in the inferred tree. Fast and scalable distance-based
methods, precise estimates of true pairwise distances and ﬁnally,
for the ﬁrst time in any rearrangement-based phylogeny infer-
ence method, the use of bootstrap scores—together make TIBA
unique.

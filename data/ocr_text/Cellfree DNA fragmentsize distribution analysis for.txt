Abstract

Background: Non—invasive detection of aneuploidies in a fetal genome through analysis of cell—free
DNA circulating in the maternal plasma is becoming a routine clinical test. Such tests, which rely
on analyzing the read coverage or the allelic ratios at single—nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) loci,
are not sensitive enough for smaller sub—chromosomal abnormalities due to sequencing biases
and paucity of SNPs in a genome.

Results: We have developed an alternative framework for identifying sub—chromosomal copy num—
ber variations in a fetal genome. This framework relies on the size distribution of fragments in a
sample, as fetal—origin fragments tend to be smaller than those of maternal origin. By analyzing the
local distribution of the cell—free DNA fragment sizes in each region, our method allows for the
identification of sub—megabase CNVs, even in the absence of SNP positions. To evaluate the accur—
acy of our method, we used a plasma sample with the fetal fraction of 13%, down—sampled it to
samples with coverage of 10X—40X and simulated samples with CNVs based on it. Our method had
a perfect accuracy (both specificity and sensitivity) for detecting 5 Mb CNVs, and after reducing the
fetal fraction (to 11%, 9% and 7%), it could correctly identify 98.82—100% of the 5 Mb CNVs and had
a true—negative rate of 95.29—99.76%.

1 Introduction

Prenatal testing for genetic abnormalities (aneuploidies and copy
number variations; CNVs) is a routine practice for pregnant women
(Driscoll and Gross, 2009). Complexities associated with traditional
invasive prenatal diagnostic methods, such as chorionic villus sam—
pling or amniocentesis, have led to research for safer non—invasive
approaches. After the discovery of fetal cell-free DNA (chNA) in
maternal plasma (Lo et 61]., 1997), several studies examined the po—
tential of using fetal chNA for non—invasive prenatal testing
(NIPT). Their results showed that methods using next—generation

sequencing were highly accurate for detecting aneuploidies (Twiss
et 61]., 2014), leading to several companies (e.g. Natera, Verinata
and Sequenom) offering clinical NIPT today.

The two complementary approaches that use fetal chNA in
plasma for detecting aneuploidies or smaller copy number variations
(CNVs) are based on read coverage and single—nucleotide poly—
morphism (SNP) allelic ratios. In both cases, chNA is sequenced
using next—generation sequencing technology. While earlier methods
have generated this data via whole—genome shotgun sequencing
(Chiu et 61]., 2008; Fan et 61]., 2008), more recent approaches often

target only the chromosomes or regions of interest to reduce the cost
of sequencing (Sparks et al., 2012). In methods that rely on cover—
age, the copy count of chromosomes (for aneuploidies) and regions
(for smaller CNVs) are predicted by comparing the proportion of
fragments that align to the target compared to a set of controls.

An orthogonal information source is the allelic ratios observed at
SNP loci. Even though fetal—origin DNA is only a small fraction of
total chNA [fetal fraction, also called the fetal content, is typically
6—12% depending on gestation age and maternal weight (Wang
et al., 2013)], the presence of extra copies of fetal chromosomes
changes the observed frequencies of the alleles at the SNP positions.
While the change may be imperceptible at a single locus due to low
fetal fraction, incorporating several SNPs can allow for accurate pre—
diction of aneuploidies. For example, Zimmermann et al. (2012)
proposed a Bayesian maximum—likelihood method that uses allele
counts at SNP loci together with genotype information of the par-
ents to predict copy count in target chromosomes. In a recent article,
we demonstrated that the information provided by allelic ratios and
coverage approaches is complementary and can be unified within a
single probabilistic framework, e.g. using hidden Markov models
(Rampééek et al., 2014).

There are multiple issues which complicate the use of coverage
and allelic ratios to uncover CNVs. There are significant number of
known (e.g. GC content) and unknown biases that affect the cover—
age. Such biases are especially prominent in smaller regions, and ex-
tensive control datasets are required to fully model them. Allelic
ratios at SNPs, while less affected by biases, are available only in
a small fraction of the genome. Furthermore, they are not uni—
formly distributed across the genome, leading to ‘blind spots’ in the
analysis. Finally, in some cases, analysis of such SNP sites requires
the presence of a paternal sample, which is often not readily
available.

Several studies have shown that fetal— and maternal-origin
chNA have distinct size distributions. Chan et al. (2004) first re—
ported this by using amplicons of different sizes in a panel of quanti-
tative polymerase chain reaction assays. Their results showed that
fetal fragments are generally shorter than maternal ones. This result
was confirmed by Fan et al. (2010) through high—throughput paired-
end sequencing of the plasma. In a recent study, Yu et al. (2014)
have used fragment—size distributions to predict aneuploidies using
microchip—based capillary electrophoresis. However, their method is
unable to detect shorter CNVs as it considers the fragment—size dis—
tribution of the whole genome rather than specific regions, and dif-
ferent regions can have different distributions due to epigenetic
factors such as the position of nucleosomes (Snyder et al., 2016).

In this work, we develop a novel method for identifying sub—
chromosomal CNVs in a fetal genome from chNA fragment-size
information. For a given target region, the method identifies a set of
‘control’ regions with similar fragment—size distribution characteris—
tics and utilizes this set of controls for predicting the fetal copy num—
ber in the target region. We test our methods on multiple sets of
simulated data and show that our method is able to identify sub—
megabase CNVs with high accuracy, which increases with the fetal
DNA fraction, depth of sequencing and length of CNVs being
predicted.

2 Methods

2.1 Overview
The fragment-size distribution analysis (FSDA) method is summar—
ized in the following five steps. The underlying probabilistic

model of fragment sizes is explained in Section 2.2, and subsequent
steps are described in the corresponding sections. For our experi-
ments, we used two chNA samples named 11 and G1, which we
used as test and reference samples respectively, as explained in
Section 2.6.

1. Using the SNP positions listed in dbSNP (Sherry et al., 2001),
FSDA ﬁnds the SNP positions in the test sample where the
mother is homozygous (only one maternal allele is observed)
and the inherited paternal allele is different from maternal (there
is a small fraction of reads with the alternate allele in the sam—
ple). The fetal-origin (paternally inherited) fragments at these
positions are identiﬁed, and the distribution of fetal-origin frag-
ments is estimated empirically from them (Fig. 1a, details in
Section 2.3).

2. To test CNVs for a speciﬁc (target) region of the test genome,
the chNA fragments in the reference sample that are mapped to
the target region are extracted and their size distribution is em-
pirically estimated (Fig. 1b, details in Section 2.4).

3. For all other regions of the reference genome, FSDA empirically
ﬁnds their fragment—size distributions. Then it calculates the dis—
tance [Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) statistic] between these distri—
butions and the distribution estimated for the target region in
the previous step. The bins with a distance smaller than a pre—
speciﬁed threshold are selected as control bins (Fig. 1c, details in
Section 2.4).

4. The chNA fragments from the test sample that are mapped to
the corresponding regions of the control bins are identiﬁed and
their size distribution is empirically estimated (Fig. 1d, details in
Section 2.5).

5. Using the fetal distribution estimated in the step 1 and the con—
trol distribution estimated in the step 4, the method derives
whether the maximum probability of observing the sizes of the
test fragments mapped to the target region is achieved directly
using the control distribution or with increased/decreased ratio
of the fetal distribution. These correspond to the normal and du—
plication/deletion predictions, respectively (Fig. 1e, details in
Section 2.5).

2.2 Fragment—size model for plasma chNA

Our prediction method is based on a model of fragment—size
distributions for different genomic regions. In this model, for any re-
gion reg in the genome, we define Dreg(s) as the probability of
observing a chNA fragment with size 5 generated from region reg.
Given the origin of a fragment in reg, we also define Mreg(s) and Freg
(s) to be the probability of it having size 5, given the fragment is of
maternal or fetal origin, respectively. Figure 2 illustrates the frag—
ment-size distribution for 11 chNA fragments mapped to chromo—
some 1, as well as the fragment—size distributions after categorizing
these fragments according to their origin (fetal or maternal).

In our model we have assumed that the mother has a normal
copy count in the target regions where we are predicting the fetal
copy count. We define Anreg as the difference of the fetal copy num-
ber in a region reg and the normal copy number (which is equal to
two), where Anreg E {—1, 0, +1} for deletion, normal and duplica—
tion cases, respectively. We also define r as the fetal fraction for re-
gions with normal fetal copy number and rmg as the fetal fraction in
the specific region reg. The variables r and rmg have different values
if and only if the fetus has an abnormal copy number at reg. Table 1
describes the variables and the functions that are frequently used
throughout this article. Using the notation introduced above, we can

Fig. 1. Overview of the method. The method starts by (a) estimating the pure fetal fragment-size distribution by SNP analysis. It then (b) estimates the size distri-
bution of the fragments in the reference sample that are mapped to the target region. (0) Candidate control bins from reference are selected based on their frag-
ment-size distribution distance (KS statistic) to the distribution estimated in the previous step. (d) The control’s fragment-size distribution in the test sample is
estimated, and the fragments mapped to the target region are extracted. (e) We use a maximum-likelihood approach to predict if there is a CNV in the target re-
gion. The formula given in the figure provides the intuition but is not precise; see Section 2.5

express the corresponding probability Dreg(s) of observing a frag—
ment of size s as a mixture of Mreg(s) and Freg(s):

Dreg(5) :  _ 1'1‘eg)Mreg(5) + 1'1‘egF1‘eg(5) 
We can derive rmg based on Anreg and r as following:

r —l— gAnreg

— 2
1 —l— gAnreg ( )

rreg :

In the fraction above, the numerator corresponds to the fetal
chNA and the denominator corresponds to the total chNA
(including both fetal and maternal). If fetus has a normal copy
count, then Anreg : 0 and the numerator and denominator would be
r and 1, respectively; hence rmg : r. Each of the two fetal copies in a
region with normal copy count account for g of the total chNA,
thus if Anreg 7E 0, the fraction of added or removed fetal chNA is
equal to g, which has to be included in both the numerator (fetal
chNA) and the denominator (total chNA).

2.3 Estimating pure fetal fragment—size distribution

The pure fetal fragment—size distribution can be estimated by
analyzing the read sequences mapped to SNP loci. If the mother
is homozygous at a SNP locus and the fetus has inherited a
different allele from the father, the fragments which support the

fetal—specific allele are all fetal in origin. For our experiments,
we found such fragments and empirically estimated their distribu—
tion. To reduce possible errors, we only considered the SNPs
that have a minor allele frequency of at least 0.01 according to the
1000 genomes project panels (1000 Genomes Project Consortium,
2015

These SNPs can also be used to estimate the fetal fraction r,
based on an allele ratio (reference allele count divided by the total
allele count) equal to g or 1 — g, depending on whether the fetus—
specific allele is the reference or the alternative. However, in the fol—
lowing experiments we assume that this ratio is known, using either
the previously determined dataset fetal fraction or the parameter
used in the simulation (when we simulate data with a different r).

While in our model we have allowed region—specific fragment—
size distributions of maternal—origin chNA, we simplify our model
by assuming that the fetal origin fragments have the same size distri—
bution across all regions of the genome. This simplification is used
because it is not feasible to train the fetal distribution over a small
region, as the source of a molecule is only known for reads that
overlap specific SNPs. This assumption is more tolerable for fetal—
origin chNA than the maternal—origin ones, because there are con—
siderably fewer fetal—origin chNA fragments (typically r< 0.12),
thus small differences in fetal distributions will not have a large im—
pact on the combined distribution.

ments for learning the empirical distributions was 3 million, 2.2 million and

2.4 Finding regions with similar fragment—size
distribution signatures
While different regions in genome may have different fragment-size
distribution signatures, our analysis shows that if two regions have
similar distributions in one sample, they are likely to also be similar
in another one. We use the two—sample KS statistic as a measure of
similarity for fragment-size distributions. Our results for two differ—
ent samples show that there is a linear correlation between the KS
statistic of the corresponding pairs, with an estimated slope and
intercept of 1.012 and —3 X 104’, respectively (see Fig. 3).

We divide the genome (excluding the sex chromosomes and the
centromeres/telomeres) into bins of 1 Mb as a set of candidate con—
trol regions. Because of the mentioned consistency, we can use a

reference plasma sample to find the candidate bins that are more
likely to have a similar fragment—size distribution to a target gen—
omic region in a new sample. For this purpose, we use a threshold
on the KS statistic to decide which candidate bins are similar enough
to the target region. Generally, the lower this threshold is set, the
more similar the candidate bins would be to the region, leading to
higher accuracy. However, an over—stringent threshold would also
cause many regions to have none or very few control bins, thus
reducing portion of genome we can make a prediction for (genome
coverage). We also add an additional constraint that a control re—
gion must be >10 Mb away from the target region, so that they are
unlikely to be impacted by same CNVs. Figure 4 shows the percent—
age of 1 Mb bins in G1, whose number of candidate bins are in spe—
cific ranges for different KS statistic thresholds. In our experiments,
unless explicitly stated, we used a KS statistic threshold of 0.003,
which covers 96.57% of the genome with 1 Mb sized bins.

2.5 Fetal copy count prediction

To predict the fetal copy number in a particular (target) region of
the genome, we designate multiple ‘control’ regions, selected to have
similar fragment-size distributions. We employ the method ex—
plained in Section 2.4 to find these controls based on a reference
sample and combine all the chNA fragments from the test sample
mapped to these regions, into one merged control.

Denote target the target region for which we want to predict the
copy count and ctrl as the merged control region designated for it.
Consider the fetal fraction is r and the fetal copy number difference
in target is Antarget. Then based on Equations (1) and (2), the prob—
ability of observing a fragment with size s at target is as follows:

7' ‘l‘ L A“tar et 7' ‘l‘ L A“tar et
D Z 1 _ 2 g 2 g

We have assumed the controls have a normal copy number
(Anctrl : 0) and they were selected with the criteria of having a frag-
ment—size distribution signature similar to target, thus the following
can be concluded:

Dctrl(5) : (1 _ 7’)Mtarget(5) ‘1‘ 1’Ftarget(5) (5)

Based on Equations (4) and (5), the fragment—size distribution
Dtarget(s) can be formulated as a mixture of Dml(s) and the pure
fetal fragment—size distribution Ptarget(s):

1 % A“target

D S 2 —D S ‘1‘ —
target( ) 1 ‘1‘ gAntarget Ctrl( ) 1 + 2Antarget

Ftarget(5) (6)

Denote T as the vector of fragment sizes, for the chNA frag-
ments mapped to target. Accordingly, T follows a multinomial dis-
tribution with the parameter Dtarget:

T N Multinomial(DWget) (7)

The fragment sizes in T can be directly computed from the
plasma sequencing data, while Dtarget can be derived, as shown in
Equation (6), based on DC”), Ptarget, r and Antarget. The distribution
Dml is empirically estimated from size of the fragments mapped to
ctrl, while the pure fetal fragment—size distribution Pm; and the fetal
fraction r, which we have assumed both to be invariable throughout
all normal regions in genome, can be estimated by analyzing the
reads mapped to the SNP positions across genome, as explained in
Section 2.3. Figure 5 illustrates the Bayesian network for our model.
We perform maximum-likelihood estimation to estimate Antarget,
using the likelihood function p(T|Antarget,Dmemrgehr), which is
the probability mass function of the multinomial distribution in
Equation (7), and its parameter Dtarget can be derived from the
Equation (6).

 

Fig. 5. The Bayesian network for the introduced model. The values for the
variables in gray nodes are assumed to be known a priori

In our experiments, we have considered an uniform prior for
Antarget; however, by using maximum a posteriori estimation instead
of maximum-likelihood estimation, a non—uniform prior can be ad—
justed based on the required sensitivity for the application.

2.6 Data

We used the data provided by Kitzman et al. (2012), retrieved from
dbGaP with the accession number ‘phs0005 00.v1.p1’. The dataset
includes two different pregnancy cases denoted 11 and G1. For each
pregnancy, this includes whole—genome sequencing data of maternal
plasma chNA as well as whole—genome sequencing data of mother,
father and the child after birth. When predicting fetal CNVs, our
method solely uses the chNA data of the plasma sample alone and
does not use the separate sequencing data of the parents or the child.
The fetal fractions were reported to be 0.13 and 0.07 for 11 and G1
samples, respectively. In both cases, the fetus was a male. For our
experiments, we used G1 as our reference to find the regions with
similar fragment-size distributions and ran all of the prediction tests
for 11.

The data had been obtained by Illumina 100 bp paired—end
sequencing and aligned to GRCh37 using BWA—0.6.1 (Li and
Durbin, 2009). The size of a DNA fragment is calculated from the
position of the paired reads.

2.7 Simulation

Using our original plasma samples, we simulated samples with
reduced fetal fractions, reduced coverage and with ‘spiked’ CNVs in
different locations of the genome. Reducing the coverage was done
by uniformly down-sampling the fragments to reach the target
coverage (10X, 20X and 40X).

We simulated samples with reduced fetal fractions to examine
how well our method would perform if the fetal fraction was lower
than what it really is in our original sample. Consider we intend to
reduce the fetal fraction of a sample from r to r’. If we knew the ori—
gin of the chNA fragments, we could reduce the fetal fraction by
removing the fetal-origin fragments with the following rate:

1163’, = 1 — —5(1 T r)
r ’ r(1 —r’)

However, the origin of the chNA fragments is not known. As a
result, we randomly remove the fragments based on their size, with
the probability Rpla’m"

r—>r’

(s) for a fragment of size s:

R“““%) = P(fetal|s)Rfeml (9)

r—>r’ r—>r’

Where [)(fetalls) is the probability of a fragment with size 5 be—
longing to the fetus, which can be derived using Bayes rule:

P(fetal|s) : W

(10)

In the above equation [)(slfetal) is the pure fetal fragment—size
distribution probability for size 5, analogous to Freg(s), and
[)(fetal) is the prior for fetal fragments in plasma which is the
fetal fraction and is analogous to r. Further, [)(s) is the prior prob—
ability for chNA fragment size in plasma, which is empirically esti-
mated by normalizing the count of fragment sizes for chNA
fragments mapped to the region we are simulating and is analogous
to Dreg(s).

We simulate duplications by adding fragment samples drawn
from the fetal fragment—size distribution and deletions by reducing
the fetal fraction in the intended CNV region.

3 Results

In this section, we evaluate the performance of our method by per—
forming tests using the chNA samples 11 and G1. In Section 3.1,
we evaluate the performance of our method on chNA data with
altered fetal fractions, reduced coverages and simulated CNVs of
different types and sizes, as well as investigating the effects of choos—
ing different thresholds for control bin selection. In Section 3.2, we
compare the performance of our method with our own previous

3.1 Experiments on simulated data

We tested our method on simulated data with different fetal frac-
tions, from 7% to 13% and at 10X, 20X and 40X coverage. For se—
lecting candidate control bins, we used the KS threshold of 0.003
and required at least one control bin. In each experiment, the target
regions included every non—overlapping bin in the genome (exclud—
ing the sex chromosomes and the centromeres/telomeres) with the
intended size that had at least one valid control bin. The number of
these bins were 4368, 2221, 1105 and 425, for 500kb, 1 Mb, 2Mb
and 5 Mb CNV sizes, respectively. For each target region, we tested
for three cases of duplication, deletion and no simulated CNV. The
results (Fig. 6) show that our method has high recall and precision,
especially with higher fetal fractions and larger bins.

We also evaluated how using different KS thresholds and requir-
ing multiple control bins affect the accuracy and coverage of the
method. We tested this on a simulated sample with 7% fetal frac—
tion, at 20X coverage and with 1 Mb size CNVs. The results (Fig. 7)
show that at KS threshold of 0.003, there is a significant jump in the
fraction of genome for which controls are available, with a slight
drop—off in accuracy. Further increasing this threshold has a smaller
effect, while accuracy continues dropping.

3.2 Comparing with a previous method
We compared the current FSDA method with our own previous
SNP/coverage analysis—based method called ‘fCNV’ (Rampasek
et al., 2014). Both were tested on down—sampled versions of 11 sam—
ple (13% fetal fraction, with depth of coverage of 20X and 40X),
using G1 as reference.

To compare the sensitivity of fCNV to FSDA, using the simula-
tion tool designed for fCNV we simulated 60 samples with CNVs,

Fig. 7. Results of the experiments with different thresholds on the KS statistic
(0.002, 0.003 and 0.004) as well as different requirement for number of valid
control bins. The experiments were performed on samples with 20X cover-
age, 7% fetal fraction and 1 Mb target regions. The table in the top shows the
F-measures of the predictions (considering duplications and deletions as

 

positive cases and normal regions as negative cases) and the table in the bot-
tom shows the percentage of the target bins in genome which had sufficient
controls for given KS threshold. The columns correspond to the KS thresh-
olds and the rows represent the number of required control bins

including 20 deletions and 40 duplications, repeating this for differ-
ent CNV size settings (500 kb, 1 Mb and 5 Mb). The comparison of
the results to FSDA (detailed in Section 3.1) is presented in Figure 6.
As explained in Section 3.1, each experiment for FSDA includes
4368, 2221 or 425 samples, corresponding to the number of avail—
able bins with size 5 00 kb, 1 Mb and 5 Mb.

The direct comparison of the specificity of the two methods is
difficult because FSDA makes calls independently for each bin,
while fCNV makes calls genome wide, which can start at any SNP
position. Hence, we evaluate the specificity as the percentage of the
genome identified as being part of a CNV of a specific size. On the
20X coverage whole genome with no implanted CNVs, fCNV
falsely reported three CNVs of 500 kb and one CNV of 5 Mb; on the
40X coverage genome, five CNVs of 500 kb size and six CNVs of
1 Mb size were reported. To derive the specificity for fCNV, we cal—
culated the false—negative rate as the ratio of the total length of false
CNVs (separately for each category) by the total length of the effect—
ive input genome (3 Gb). The specificity results for FSDA are calcu—
lated as the ratio of bins called as CNV false positives by the total
number of available bins (4368, 2221 or 425 depending on the size).

The results (Table 2) show that in all cases the new proposed
method (FSDA) highly outperformed fCNV in sensitivity, which has
difficulty due to the low sequencing coverage (it was designed for
80X coverage). However, the fCNV had slightly better performance
in specificity for 1 Mb and 500 kb cases.

4 Discussion

In this work, we introduce a novel method for accurate sub—
megabase CNV prediction based on the fragment-size

this by using an orthogonal, reference sample to find such re—
gions. Depending on the application, it can be important to have
fewer false—positives (calling wrong CNVs) or fewer false—nega—
tives (missing actual CNVs). The prior on the fetal copy number,
which we assumed to be uniform in our experiments, can be ad—
justed to change the CNV calling rate and the sensitivity/specifi-
city trade—off.

Our model has several shortcomings, which can be addressed
in future work. First, while we model the length distribution based
on combination of maternal and fetal genomes, we do not directly
model the presence of small scale insertion/deletion (indel) vari-
ation, which also impacts the distribution of fragment lengths [see
e.g. Lee et al. (2009)] or CNVs in the maternal sample. While these
events are rare and lead to changes of the fragment—length distribu—
tion that are different from changes by fetal copy count, they could
compromise the accuracy of our method and hence should be mod—
eled directly.

The accuracy of our method depends highly on the fetal frac—
tion r, which we assume is known. The estimation of r from real
data is straightforward at higher fetal fractions and coverages,
based on sites where the mother is homozygous for one allele, and
the paternally inherited allele is different. As fetal fraction de—
creases and coverage falls this becomes harder due to allele drop—
out, and for coverages lower than 10X, we would need orthogonal
methods for identifying such fragments. Effective methods for dir—
ectly estimating r from NIPT data would improve the robustness
of our algorithm.

A general weakness of our experiments is in the simulation,
where we assume that the size distribution of fetal-origin DNA is
uniform across the genome. This makes our simulated data cleaner
than a realistic sample. A better simulation framework, or availabil-
ity of real samples with CNVs, would help the development of new
methods in this field.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Network-level visualization of functional data is a key
aspect of both analysis and understanding of biological systems. In
a continuing effort to create clear and integrated visualizations that
facilitate the gathering of novel biological insights despite the over-
whelming complexity of data, we present here the GrAph LANdscape
VisualizaTion (GALANT), a Cytoscape plugin that builds functional
landscapes onto biological networks. By using GALANT, it is possible
to project any type of numerical data onto a network to create a
smoothed data map resembling the network layout. As a Cytoscape
plugin, GALANT is further improved by the functionalities of
Cytoscape, the popular bioinformatics package for biological network
visualization and data integration.

1 INTRODUCTION

The network modeling of biological systems has been demon-
strated to be a formidable tool to decipher the collective behavior
of various biological processes. However, the construction of a
biological network per se is not sufﬁcient to accomplish this task.
To better understand the biological systems and their responses,
it is necessary to extend and complement these networks with
data collected from different sources, such as gene or protein
expression profiles (Bebek et al., 2012). Moreover, owing to
the human natural strengths in rapid visual pattern recognition,
the visualization of these data through maps overlaid on inter-
action networks would be an efficient way to extract information
that could be missed by a purely statistical or numerical
approach.

Virtually, all existing tools capable to map data to biological
networks perform this task by coloring the nodes according to
data values (for a review, see Gehlenborg et al., 2010). Although
these tools have proven to be useful, these “colored networks’—
specially the large and dense networks—are often noisy, and,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

therefore, the visual identification of patterns in the data
mapped to these networks are difﬁcult. To facilitate this task,
these large colored networks could be transformed in smoothed
data maps. To the best of our knowledge, only the ViaComplex
(Castro et al., 2009), an open source software implemented in
Fortran, is currently able to generate smoothed data maps by
projecting data as functional landscapes onto biological net-
works. To expand the collection of tools providing this function-
ality, we developed in this work a Cytoscape plugin version of
ViaComplex: the GrAph LANdscape VisualizaTion
(GALANT). Although GALANT provides the same essential
functionality found in the original ViaComplex, its main advan-
tage over ViaComplex is the well-known versatile network visu-
alization and data integration environment provided by
Cytoscape (Shannon et al., 2003).

2 DESCRIPTION

GALANT projects any type of numerical data onto a network to
create landscapes resembling the network layout. For this pur-
pose, GALANT uses the java class ‘HeatMap’ created by Mat-
thew Beckler (http://www.mbeckler.org/heatMap/). ‘HeatMap’
defines the color gradient by finding the minimum and maximum
values in a matrix superposed to the network. The values of this
matrix are calculated from the data mapped to nodes in the
network through three different functions: Gaussian, Moving
Average or Power Law (see “Supplementary Data’ for details
on these functions).

GALANT offers a friendly interface fully integrated with
Cytoscape where users can easily build their landscapes of inter-
est by using one of the previously mentioned functions. Users
can project their functional data either as raw values by selecting
the ‘Attribute’ option or as normalized ratios between raw values
from two different conditions by selecting the “Exp X Control’
option (see details at http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/galant).
Moreover, in both options, users can set parameters to control
smoothness (‘sigma’ in Gaussian mode, ‘smoothness’ in Moving
Average mode and ‘exponent’ in Power Law mode) and reso-
lution to get the desired landscape more appropriate for their
analyses (see details at http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/galant).

After generating the landscape according to the selected par-
ameters, users can also select the type of color gradient that is
more appropriate to represent their mapped data. GALANT

provides 10 different types of color gradient through the
Matthew Beckler’s ‘HeatMap’ class (http://www.mbeckler.org/
heatMap/). In addition, users can export the landscapes as
images in PNG format.

found in a tutorial page at http://www.lbbc.ibb.unesp.br/galant.

3 CASE STUDY

As a simple example of GALANT application (additional ex-
amples can be found in the ‘Supplementary Data’), we sought to
verify the projection of two different types of data onto a cancer
signaling network constructed by merging cancer pathways pro-
vided by the KEGG PATHWAY database (Kotera et al., 2012):
stress centrality and the differential gene expression in lung
cancer in comparison with normal lung (Fig. 1). First, we
imported to Cytoscape the cancer signaling network. We then
calculated the stress centrality for each node by using
NetworkAnalyzer (Assenov et al., 2008) and imported the gene
expression values (dataset GSE19804) from the Gene Expression
Omnibus database (Barrett et al., 2011). By using GALANT, we
generated the functional landscape maps shown in Figure 1. The
lower and upper panels of Figure 1 show, respectively, the pro-
jection of stress values and the ratio between gene expression
values of cancer and normal tissues onto the cancer signaling

network by using the available methods for image smoothing.
As an example of analysis, it is possible to observe that the sub-
networks showing the highest stress centrality values match those
containing genes highly expressed in lung cancer.

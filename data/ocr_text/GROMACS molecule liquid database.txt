ABSTRACT

Motivation: The molecular dynamics simulation package
GROMACS is a widely used tool used in a broad range of
different applications within physics, chemistry and biology. It is
freely available, user friendly and extremely efficient. The GROMACS
software is force field agnostic, and compatible with many molecular
dynamics force fields; coarse-grained, unified atom, all atom as well
as polarizable models based on the charge on a spring concept.
To validate simulations, it is necessary to compare results from the
simulations to experimental data. To ease the process of setting
up topologies and structures for simulations, as well as providing
pre-calculated physical properties along with experimental values
for the same we provide a web-based database, containing 145
organic molecules at present.

Results: Liquid properties of 145 organic molecules have been
simulated using two different force fields, OPLS all atom and
Generalized Amber Force Field. So far, eight properties have
been calculated (the density, enthalpy of vaporization, surface
tension, heat capacity at constant volume and pressure, isothermal
compressibility, volumetric expansion coefficient and the static
dielectric constant). The results, together with experimental values
are available through the database, along with liquid structures and
topologies for the 145 molecules, in the two force fields.
Availability: The database is freely available under http://
virtualchemistry.org.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular dynamics simulations can be a very useful tool in
understanding fundamental interactions in simple molecular liquids
and crystals as well as complex biomolecular systems. The accuracy
of predictions based on molecular dynamics simulations are limited
by the applied force ﬁeld. Force ﬁelds are normally developed to
reproduce certain speciﬁc experimental properties, such as density
or energies, or to reproduces known molecular structures. A model
that captures the basic physics underlying the atomic interactions can
in principle be used to predict outside the realm of parameterization,
and this is in fact often done. In order to validate the predictions
based on force ﬁelds, we have recently performed force ﬁeld
benchmarks of proteins (Lange at 611., 2010) and liquids (Caleman
at 611., 2012).

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The latest incarnation of the GROMACS software was described
by Hess at 611. (2008) while a recent overview paper (van der
Spoel and Hess, 2011) describes future prospects for the software
suite. Here we present a database holding simulation resources,
namely liquid structures and topology ﬁles. The construction of
molecular topologies—describing connectivity, atom types and
partial charges—is unfortunately still cumbersome. There is a large
user base for the GROMACS software—over 2000 people that
subscribe to a mailing list—and therefore we envision that there
will be a signiﬁcant demand for the kind of service the molecule &
liquid database provides, since questions about topology building
are among the most common ones on the mailing list.

2 METHODS

The database contains GROMACS topology ﬁles (.top/.itp) for all the
included molecules, for both the Generalized Amber Force Field (GAFF)
(Wang e1611., 2004) and OPLS/AA (J orgensen and Tirado—Rives, 2005) force
ﬁelds. The molecular models were built using Molden (Schaftenaar and
Noordik, 2000) and PRODRG (Schuettelkopf and van Aalten, 2004), and
optimized using quantum calculations with Gaussian 03 (Frisch at 611., 2004)
at the Hartree—Fock level employing the 6—311G** basis set (Blaudeau e1611.,
1997; Krishnan e1611., 1980), as provided by the Basis Set Exchange website
(Schuchardt at 611., 2007).

The GAFF topologies were generated using the Antechamber software
(Wang e1611., 2004, 2005) using partial charges calculated with the restrained
electrostatic potential method (Bayly at 611., 1993). The GAFF topologies
were converted into GROMACS format using the amb2gmx.pl script
(Mobley at 611., 2006) (http: / / ffamber . cnsm . csulb . edu/) — note
that at present the ACPYPI tool (http://code.google.com/p/acpype/) is the
recommended tool for converting from AMBER to GROMACS. OPLS/AA
topologies were built using GROMACS tools and verﬁed manually.

Gas—phase structures as well as liquid structures (after equilibration) are
available for all molecules in pdb format. Finally, the database contains
simulated and, where available, experimental physical properties (fully
referenced) for up to eight different observables for all molecules: the
density, enthalpy of vaporization, heat capacities at constant pressure and
constant volume, the surface tension, isothermal compressibility, volumetric
expansion coefﬁcient and the static dielectric constant. For details about the
underlying simulations and analysis, we refer to (Caleman at 611., 2012).

All data are stored in a database, using the structured query langauge
(SQL) to ensure portability, which is processed using a script to obtain the (at
present) completely static website. The website is organized using a relatively
simple directory structure with one subdirectory per compound, and within
these one subdirectory per force ﬁeld.

3 DISCUSSION

The molecular modeling community has a lot to gain from easy
access to pre—equilibrated simulation structures and topologies that

are validated against experimental data. The GROMACS molecule
& liquid database freely provides this for a set of over a hundred
molecules, an example molecule entry being shown in Figure 1.
Presently, two of the most widely used force ﬁelds for organic
molecules, GAFF (Wang et 611., 2004) and OPLS/AA (Jorgensen
and Tirado—Rives, 2005) are supported, and there are plans to
include models based on the CHARMM generalized force ﬁeld
(Vanommeslaeghe et 611., 2010) as well. The expectation is that this
test set will help users to establish how good these force ﬁelds are not
only for the molecules included, but also for similar molecules. For
this reason, the test set was picked such that it would include a large
variety of chemical moieties. All topologies and structures available
have been checked manually and calculated physical properties
along with experimental data are provided for each of the the
molecules, including corresponding experimental data which is fully
referenced. A similar effort providing input ﬁles for molecules based
on the GROMOS96 force ﬁeld (van Gunsteren et 611., 1996) was
announced recently (Malde et 611., 2011).

Further molecules, simulation results and corresponding
experimental data will be added to the database in the future. The
ultimate goal with this work is to build up a large database, that can
be used both for getting reliable topologies and liquid structures, and
to provide a list of relevant physical properties for comparison to
experiments. The reference values provided (Caleman et 611., 2012)
can also serve as a benchmark for force ﬁeld improvements, for
instance using polarizable models (Caleman and van der Spoel,
2007; Caleman et 611., 2011; van der Spoel and Hess, 2011; van
Maaren and van der Spoel, 2001).

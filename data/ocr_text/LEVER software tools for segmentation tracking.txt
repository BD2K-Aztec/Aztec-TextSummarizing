Abstract

The analysis of time—lapse images showing cells dividing to produce clones of related cells is an
important application in biological microscopy. Imaging at the temporal resolution required to es—
tablish accurate tracking for vertebrate stem or cancer cells often requires the use of transmitted
light or phase—contrast microscopy. Processing these images requires automated segmentation,
tracking and lineaging algorithms. There is also a need for any errors in the automated processing
to be easily identified and quickly corrected. We have developed LEVER, an open source software
tool that combines the automated image analysis for phase—contrast microscopy movies with an
easy—to—use interface for validating the results and correcting any errors.

Availability and Implementation: LEVER is available free and open source, licensed under the GNU
GPLV3. Details on obtaining and using LEVER are available at http://n2t.net/ark:/87918/d9rp4t.

New and rapid development of microscope imaging technologies
have enabled biological researchers to focus on the analysis of living
cell behaviors. Manual analysis of the data is difficult and time con—
suming. Behavioral changes in cells may also be subtle and not easily
identified by a human observer. These challenges necessitate the de—
velopment of computational tools (Cohen, 2014).

LEVER combines lineage analysis with the segmentation and
tracking of individual cells. This allows the quantification of individ—
ual cellular properties and their changes across generations or be—
tween cells of different fate. In a twist on the usual processing ﬂow,
LEVER uses population information from the lineage tree to refine
the segmentation results, informing the number of cells in each con-
nected component of foreground pixels and greatly reducing error
rates (Winter et al., 2015). LEVER is designed so that errors in the
automated results can be easily corrected.

Several tools provide features for lineage identification and ana-
lysis, but there is a lack of tools that support phase contrast micros—
copy. CellProfiler contains modules for tracking proliferating cells
automatically (Bray and Carpenter, 2015). The Icy bioinformatics
platform supports several active contour algorithms for cell

segmentation and tracking (De Chaumont et al., 2012). Both Icy
and CellProfiler focus on ﬂuorescent image data and do not support
correction of lineaging or tracking results. Amat et al.(2014) provide
a tool for semi—automated lineage analysis of 3—D ﬂuorescent mi—
croscopy. This approach is similar to LEVER, but is designed specif—
ically for 3—D fluorescence images. Extensions to LEVER supporting
2-D and 3-D multichannel fluorescence time—lapse images
(Mankowski et al., 2014; Wait et al., 2014) are under active
development.

LEVER images can be imported using the integrated OME bio—
formats library (Linkert et al., 2010), or read directly (Fig. 1A). The
segmentation preview window allows the user to compare results
from several cell detection algorithms (Fig. 1B). Next, segmentation
results are associated between frames using multitemporal associ—
ation tracking (MAT). MAT has been effectively applied in a variety
of applications (Chenouard et al., 2014; Mankowski et al., 2014;
Winter et al., 2011, 2012, 2015), all using the same implementation.
Tracking results are next used to form the lineage tree (Fig. 1C), or
the tree can be specified by manually identifying mitosis events
(Fig. 1D).

Fig. 1. LEVER processing pipeline. Cells in the input image sequence (A) are automatically identified. Cell detection algorithms and parameters are tested on sin-

gle image frames using the segmentation previewer (B). LEVER automatically creates an initial lineage tree based on cell tracking (C). The user quickly identifies
all mitotic events to specify a corrected lineage tree in minutes (D). Using four interacting lineages (E) LEVER segmentation refinement can automatically correct
most errors. Remaining errors are corrected manually during the refinement process (F).

Once the lineage tree is complete, the initial segmentation and
tracking can be refined. In practice, we recommend this task be
done in conjunction with validation, so any errors can be corrected
online. Segmentation refinement processes each frame in sequence
making sure that every cell on the active lineage trees has a corres—
ponding segmentation. As LEVER automatically corrects segmenta—
tion, tracking results are also updated automatically. Figure 1E and
F shows a set of four interacting trees corrected using the segmenta—
tion refinement interface. Error rates are estimated from the number
of edits required to fully correct the analysis. Once a tree has been
fully validated, descriptive statistics such as phenotype tags, cycle
times, average and standard deviations of size and speed for each
cell can be exported to any spreadsheet.

The LEVER executables require 64—bit Windows; other plat—
forms would require compiling the source code. Automated analysis
generally takes 1—2 h for large image datasets. Manual lineage iden—
tification generally takes 15—30 min even for highly proliferative
cells. Detailed documentation for using and extending LEVER is
available at http://n2t.net/ark:/87918/d9rp4t.

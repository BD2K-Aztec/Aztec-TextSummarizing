ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are short sequences that
negatively regulate gene expression. The current understanding of
miRNA and their corresponding mRNA targets is primarily based
on prediction programs. This study addresses the potential of a
coordinated action of miRNAs to manipulate the human pathways.
Specifically, we investigate the effectiveness of disrupting the
topology of human pathway graphs through a regulation by miRNAs.
Results: From a set of miRNA candidates that is associated with a
pathway, an exhaustive search for all possible doubles and triplets
(coined miR-Duo, miR-Trios) is performed. The impact of each
miR-combination on the connectivity of the pathway graph was
quantified. About 170 human pathways were tested, and the miR-
Duos and miR-Trios were scored for their ability to disrupt these
pathway graphs. We show that 75% of all pathways are effectively
disconnected by a small number of pathway-specific miR-Trios.
Only 15% of the human pathways are resistant to fragmentation
by miR-Duos or miR-Trios. Significantly, the combination of the
most effective miR-Trios is unique. Thus, a specific regulation of a
pathway within the cell is guaranteed. The impact of the selected
miR-Duo/Trios on various diseases is discussed.

Conclusions: The methodology presented shows that the synthesis
of the topology of a network with a detailed understanding of the
miRNAs’ regulation is useful in exposing critical nodes of the network.
We propose the miR-Trio approach as a basis for rationally designed
perturbation experiments.

1 INTRODUCTION

Non—coding microRNAs (miRNAs) play a role in stem cell
differentiation, cell division, immunological cell function, stress
response and cells’ identity [reviewed in (Ambros, 2004; Wienholds
and Plasterk, 2005)]. Furthermore, miRNAs are involved in the
human pathogenesis including cancer (Ventura and Jacks, 2009)
and viral infection (Cullen, 2009). Recent studies conﬁrmed the
presence of hundreds of miRNAs in healthy and diseased tissues

(Landgraf et al., 2007). A growing number of tools and algorithms
were developed for predicting miRNA—target pairs (Maziere and
Enright, 2007; Mendes et al., 2009). Currently, miRBase (Grifﬁths—
J ones et al., 2006) is the most comprehensive collection of miRNAs
with over 1000 miRNAs from human and 700 from mouse
(Bentwich, 2008). The miRNAs are estimated to target over a
third of the genes in human (John et al., 2004). More than dozen
miRNA—target predictors assigned potential targets for individual
miRNAs. However, the consistency among the principal miRNA—
target predictors is relatively small (Mendes et al., 2009; Thomas
et al., 2010). A direct pairing of miRNAs and mRNAs was revealed
using deep sequencing technology from Argonaute bound sequences
(Chi et al., 2009). Currently, the TarBase (Papadopoulos et al.,
2009b) and the miRecords databases (Xiao et al., 2009) are used
as sound sources for validated miRNAs and their targets.

The presence of multiple miRNAs’ binding sites, on the same
transcript, augments its regulation level (Brodersen and Voinnet,
2009; Hon and Zhang, 2007; Peter, 2010). The parallel over—
expression of three miRNAs resulted in a synergistic effect on the
transcription level of the candidate genes (Krek et al., 2005; Tu et al.,
2009). For example, the regulation of the tumor suppressor Fusl
in cancer cells depends on the coordinated action of three miRNAs
(Du et al., 2009). Importantly, introducing several miRNAs not only
affected gene candidates but also impacted regulatory pathways
(Ivanovska and Cleary, 2008; Mu et al., 2009). Considering
pathways and diseases as the predictions’ objective reduces the noisy
predictions of miRNA—gene targets, as demonstrated by miRNApath
(Chiromatzo et al., 2007) and DIANA—miRPath (Papadopoulos
et al., 2009a, b).

This study raises the possibility that a cooperative action of a
small, selected group of miRNA can alter the expression of gene—
targets that belong to some pathways, without scarifying speciﬁcity.
More importantly, the concept that is investigated argues that
disruption of the pathway’s topology has the potential to alter the
outcome of the targeted pathway. A support for this notion stems
from the following: (i) A number of miRNAs can act cooperatively;
(ii) Multiple miRNAs disrupt disease pathways; (iii) Genes that
comprise the regulatory and signaling pathways are amenable to
miRNA regulation; (iv) The quantities of miRNAs in cells are
strongly regulated; (v) Diseases and developmental stages are often
speciﬁed by altered expression of a number of miRNAs.

Herein, we prioritize each pathway according to its susceptibility
to a regulation by a small group of miRNAs. We included the most
reliable resources for human pathways from pathway interaction
database (PID) (hosted by the National Cancer Institute, NCI)
(Schaefer et al., 2009) and KEGG (Ogata et al., 1999). Many of the

pathways were previously analyzed in view of their modular nature,
redundancy and robustness against perturbations (Ideker and Sharan,
2008; Stelling et a1. 2004). While recent studies have acknowledged
the effectiveness of miRNAs on regulation pathways (Cui et 611.,
2006; Gusev et 611., 2007), the connectivity of the genes in the
pathway was not taken into account.

First, we represent all high quality human pathways as undirected
graphs and present a pathway disconnecting score. Then, we deﬁne
a set of miRNA candidates based on the likelihood to regulate the
genes of the subject pathway. The miRNA set is then exhaustively
searched for miRNA—triplets (i.e. miR—Trios) that maximize the
disruption of a given pathway accordingly to various measures
for network graph fragmentation. This procedure was repeated for
miRNA doublets (coined miR—Duos).

We present a method for prioritizing a small subset of miRNAs
with maximal impact on pathway connectivity. A quantitative
change in a set of miRNAs is expected to alter the pathway outcome.
This procedure implements the updated view on cellular miRNAs
that ‘work together’ (Peter, 2010; Salmena et 611., 2011). Our
pathway—speciﬁc approach complements a direct manipulation of
genes via RNAi with the use of siRNA and shRNA. We demonstrate
the strength and weakness of the approach by analyzing the top
scoring miRNA sets for different signaling pathways, especially in
the context of diseases.

2 METHODS
2.1 Databases

The database of miRror (Friedman et a1., 2010) is based on the resources
from the principal miRNA—target prediction tools. The resources used are:
(i) TargetScan (Lewis et a1., 2003); (ii) microCosm that is based on miRanda
algorithm (John et a1., 2004); (iii) PicTar (Krek et a1., 2005); (iv) DIANA—
MicroT (Maragkakis et a1., 2009); (v) PITA (Kertesz et a1., 2007); (vi)
mirZ (Hausser et 611., 2009); (vii) microRNA.org that is based on miRanda
algorithm (Betel et a1., 2008); (viii) miRDB resource (Wang, 2008); (ix)
TargetRank (Nielsen et a1., 2007) and several smaller databases such as
RNA22.

Regulatory pathways resources: (i) The PID (Schaefer et a1., 2009)
compiles 79 human regulatory pathways that describe accepted interactions.
(ii) KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) is a comprehensive collection of
manually drawn pathway maps. These maps represent the information on
the molecular interaction and reaction networks for 93 maps.

2.2 miRror application for cooperative regulation

The miRror platform (Friedman et a1., 2010) was used to match a selected
gene list to the minimal number of preferred miRNAs sets. The statistical
method of miRror is the miRtegrate algorithm. It calculates the probability
of matches between a gene list and the genes that are reported by each of the
miRNA—targets resources. Calculating the P—value for genes as input was
performed according to the hypergeometric distribution (Friedman et a1.,
2010). The P—value thresholds that were used in this study are 0.01, unless
otherwise stated.

2.3 ID conversion for pathways

miRror platform is used to determine the match between a gene list in
a pathway and its most likely set of miRNAs that target these genes,
collectively. miRror uses the RefSeq identiﬁers as its central entry. We
applied an internal ID matching protocol to convert the KEGG ‘ofﬁcial gene
name’ into RefSeq identiﬁers. Conversion was performed using BioMart and
UniProtKB ID mapping. The match of RefSeq to the KEGG reaches 97%
coverage for human.

2.4 Constructing a pathway graph

A procedure by which the pathway is transformed into a number of genes
is by converting the pathway into a graph unit. The pathways from KEGG
(signaling and regulatory) are stored in XML format. We obtained the list
of nodes and edges from the XML format. In KEGG, nodes were entries of
type ‘gene’. Edges were connected between two nodes if a relation existed
between them. Entries of type ‘group’ were deﬁned as a node that includes
all the genes linked to it.

For each input of genes that were extracted from the pathway resource,
the miRror output set of miRNAs was mapped to these genes. Each miRNA
is mapped to a number of genes, and the set of three miRNAs (without
repetition) is referred to as a miR—Trio. In cases that the miRror output
consisted of >60 miRNAs, the most signiﬁcant 60 miRNAs with the lowest
P—values were used for the analysis. Only representative miRNAs were
included according to miRBase family assignment (Grifﬁths—Jones et a1.,
2006).

2.5 Disconnection scores

2.5.] Partition square score Targeting a gene is translated to its
elimination together with its adjacent edges. The partition to a maximum
number of small graphs provides a maximal score. Formally, for each miR—
Trio, cc_del is the CC after gene deletion. CC is the connected components
before deletion.

Z (cc_del)2

PAS = 1 — 2

2(00)
2.5.2 Betweenness score Betweenness is a centrality measure of a node
within a graph. The betweenness of a particular node is determined by
how often it appears on the shortest paths between pairs of remaining
nodes. Nodes that appear on many shortest paths have higher betweenness.
Formally, del_betweenness is the betweenness for each vertex after gene
deletion. Betweenness is the betweenness score (BES) of the graph before
deletion.

Z (del_betweenness)

BES = 1 —

Z (betweenness)
2.5.3 Fraction of edges score A miR—Trio that removes many edges will
hold a high score. Formally, denote del_edges as the edges after gene deletion
and edges as the edges before gene deletion.

Z (del_edges)
Z (edges)

In order to attenuate the score for miR—Trios that eliminate all genes in
the network, a normalization factor was included. This factor is deﬁned
as the square root of the number of remaining vertices after vertex
elimination divided by the total number of vertices in the graph. The factor
is then multiplied (before getting the root) by (number of vertices in the
graph/number of vertices in the graph —1) to provide a perfect score of 1
(if only one gene has been targeted). Notice that ‘number of vertices in the
graph’ is canceled out.

FES=1—

Z (del_vertices)

Normalized_score 2 score ' ,
Z (vertlces — 1)

Each score (as above) ranges between 0 and 1, before and after normalization.
For each miR—Trio we deﬁne the maximal disintegration score (DIS) as the
maximal score obtained by any of the three scoring methods described above.

2.6 miR-Trio exhaustive search

The number of miRNAs that are assigned by miRror was used to determine
the number of miR—Trios tests. Only pathways that were associated with
at least three miRNAs were analyzed. miRror was activated by using all

Fragmentation of human pathways by miRNAs

 

possible gene—targets (ignoring tissues/cell—line ﬁlters) (Friedman et a1.,
2010). The analysis is limited to 60 miRNAs per pathway. Therefore, the
maximal search is the number of different possible triplets (60 choose 3 =
34 220). Each miR—Trio was tested individually in view of the graph topology
and the different scoring methods (see above). The miR—Trios that achieved
maximal DIS were deﬁned as ‘top scoring’. We repeated the protocol to test
the concept of miR—Duos (pairs of miRNAs). All miR—Trios or miR—Duos
that are within the top 5% of the maximal DIS for each pathway are deﬁned
as ‘top 5%’.

3 RESULTS

We compiled the manually curated pathways from KEGG and
PID (NCI human pathways) resources, covering 93 and 79 human
pathways, respectively. The conversion relies on a simpliﬁcation
of the KEGG pathway by excluding non—protein components and
localization information. The conversion creates pathway graphs
that are used throughout this study. About half of the pathway
graphs are composed of only one or two connected components
(CCs, Fig. 1A). The quantitative properties of KEGG pathways are
listed in Supplementary Table 81. The conversion of the KEGG
pathway to a graph is illustrated for ‘Insulin signaling pathway’
(Fig. 1B).

3.1 Selecting the miRNA candidates for a pathway

Analysis of a pathway via the gene—target collection by any of
the miRNA prediction tools usually results in tens and hundreds
of miRNAs. For example, considering the miRNA predictions
for some of the 54 genes participating in ‘Axonal Guidance
pathway’ (KEGGzhsa04360) suggests thousands of predictions by
the miRanda algorithm (John et a1., 2006). Speciﬁcally, the EPHA7
(Ephrin receptor A7) is mapped to 159 miRNAs, PPP3CA (protein
phosphatase 3) to 184 miRNAs with several other proteins including
RASAl, RACl, CDC42 associated with ~100 miRNAs each. Other
miRNA—target predictors connect these genes with even larger sets
of putative miRNAs (data not shown).

In order to determine the number of miRNA candidates for a
given human pathway, the number of genes within the pathway
is considered. This number for human KEGG pathways ranges
from 12 to 247 (Supplementary Table 81). Analysis of a pathway
via the gene—targets set by individual miRNA prediction databases
results in hundreds of possible miRNAs. Therefore, matching a small
number of miRNAs to a particular pathway is virtually impossible
with the current predictors. To address this challenge, we selected
the candidate miRNAs by the miRror approach (Friedman et a1.,
2010).

miRror is a context—dependent statistically based tool that
determines the most likely set of miRNAs that regulates the input
genes. Thus, the output of miRror for any pathway is a short
list of miRNAs that collectively target the pathway’s genes. The
list of possible miRNAs is ranked according to a predetermined
statistical threshold using the miRNA—target predictors (total 12
databases).

Using the same example of the ‘Axon guidance’ pathway (KEGG:
hsa04360, 54 genes), miRror reports on only 37 miRNAs for a
predetermined threshold of P—value —0.01. We limited the results
for cases that are supported by at least two miRNA—target predicting
databases.

targeted by the miR—Trio is ‘eliminated’ from the graph. The effect on graph
connectivity is measured by alternative scoring methods (marked as Score 1,
Score 2).

3.2 The procedure for identifying the miRNA pathway
perturbations

The goal of our strategy is to propose a small number of miRNAs that
are expected to maximally affect the cell function, by a perturbation
of some pathway. We quantiﬁed the impact of miRNA triplets on
any selected pathway. Obviously, there is nothing extraordinary in
choosing triplets for the analyses. We considered triplets as possible
sets from a computational perspective. We examined, for each
pathway, all possible combinations of triplet miRNAs (referred to
as miR—Trios) based on the initial list of the miRNA candidates. A
schematic representation of the procedure for miR—Trios selection
is shown in Figure 2. For example, for 40 miRNAs 9880 possible
miR—Trios were tested and this number is doubled for 50 miRNAs
(see Section 2).

3.3 The disconnecting score is indicative of the
pathway’s fragility

There are several approaches that quantify and evaluate the
importance of an individual component in a complex biological
pathway. In seeking miR—Trios with a maximal potential to affect a
given pathway, the pathway graph topology and connectivity need
to be incorporated into the scoring scheme (Fig. 2).

Since no one scoring method captures the impact on disconnecting
the pathway graph, we applied several complementary scoring
systems.

higher score to miR—Trios that remove the largest percentage
of edges.

0 Betweenness score (BES). This score rewards the miR—Trios
that eliminate vertices with high centrality.

0 Partition square score (PAS). This score gives high scores to
miR—Trios that breakdown the pathway into smaller CCs.

Disconnecting score (DIS) is the highest maximal score from all
three scoring modes (each score ranges from 0 to 1).

Figure 3 shows the results for the top scoring miR—Trios for each
KEGG or PID pathway. Two observations are evident from the
analysis of the two resources for human pathways: (i) Maximal DIS
values are associated with the pathways from the two resources. Still
the highest scores are associated with KEGG pathways. (ii) Each of
the three scoring modes contributes to the maximal DIS (Fig. 3B).

Figure 4 is a summary of the correlation that is observed
between any pairs of the scoring modes. PAS correlates with
BES (KEGG and PID at the R2=O.659 and 0.482, respectively).

The PAS—FES and BES—FES pairs are also correlated. For most
pathways, the difference in the best scores that are obtained from the
different methods is signiﬁcant. For example, the best miR—Trio for
‘Neurotrophin signaling’ is ranked sixth for the PAS and 61 for the
BES score. Correlation coefﬁcients were calculated for all pathways
(Fig. 4).

3.4 Only few miR-Trios assigned with most pathways

Most pathways that are subjected to miRNAs regulation are
associated with only a few top—scoring miR—Trios. This is best
reﬂected by the compression factor for the selected miR—Trios. The
compression factor denotes the fraction of the original number of
all combinations of miR—Trios tested for that pathway and the actual
top scoring miR—Trios. For example, for pathways that have >5000
potential miR—Trios each, the compression is 6000—10 000—folds.

Table 1 suggests that each pathway is unique in its trend toward
the number of candidate miR—Trios. Among the 93 KEGG pathways,
there are 21 pathways with >10 000 miR—Trios candidates and 20
pathways with a search space of <100 candidates. We veriﬁed
that the correlation coefﬁcient between the number of the highest
scoring miR—Trios and the total number of the searched miR—Trios is
negligible (R2 20.0306). Similarly, there is no correlation between
the miR—Trios search space and the DIS value for a pathway.

3.5 Selecting the miRNA candidates for a pathway

Figure 5 shows the pathway graph of ‘Insulin signaling pathway’.
While it is associated with 47 miRror—based miRNAs, only two
miR—Trios have maximal DIS. The disconnection of the network by
miR—Trios is evident. In this example, fragmentation occurs from
the original two CCs (Fig. l) to 39 CCs, most of them containing
a single gene. At such a level of partitioning, some genes (six
genes) become isolated as a byproduct of neighboring edge removal
(Fig. 5B, isolated circles).

3.6 Maximal speciﬁcity by the top scoring miR-Trios

Over 4200 nodes are included in the analysis of human pathway
graphs. Naturally, multiple pathways share many of the genes.
For example, MAPKl appears in a quarter of the tested
pathways (46 pathways). The genes that are associated with >20
pathways are GRB2, EGFR, BAD, EGFR, AKT3, SRC and more.
Not surprisingly, these are proteins that often serve as connectors in

the pathway graphs. Thus, targeting these signaling genes will lead
to the ‘collapse’ of the pathway.

We showed that these proteins are indeed almost always
disconnected from the pathway graphs by miR—Trios (Fig. 5B,
circled). We thus tested the possibility that only a few miRNAs are
repeatedly included among the top scoring miR—Trios, speciﬁcally
those that target the key signaling proteins. However, this scenario
has not been manifested. We noted that only a few miRNAs
participate in more than one pathway. From a collection of 214
different miRNAs, 150 miRNAs are involved in only a single
pathway.

The miRNAs that are involved in the top scoring miR—Trios for
multiple pathways are miR—2l8 (six), miR—518d—3p (ﬁve), miR—487b
and miR—147b (four pathways, each). This unexpected diversity
argues that the critical factor in selecting the top scored miR—Trio
strongly dependent of the graph topology rather than on the identity
of the individual nodes in the pathway. Inspecting the overlap among
all 133 pathways (having DIS > 0) indicates that no two pathways
share an identical miR—Trio.

3.7 Minimal miRNA combinations are associated with
maximal graph fragmentation

From thousands of miR—Trios combinations, only few miR—Trios
led to maximal DIS for a given pathway (Table l). The number
of miRNAs involved in these miR—Trios is often limited to a few
combinations. Analyzing all pathways revealed that on average,
only—four to ﬁve miRNAs are associated with the set of selected
top scoring miR—Trios.

A similar analysis was repeated using pairs of miRNA as seed
for the regulation of the pathway graphs. We refer to this analysis
as miR—Duos. The overall results for the human pathways (93
KEGG and 79 from PID) resemble that obtained for the miR—
Trios and for 40% of the results, the DIS values of the miR—Duo
were identical to those obtained from the miR—Trio analysis. The
majority of the cases are explained by the ‘redundancy’ in selection
of miRNAs in the sets of miR—Trio. For example, in the case of
‘ErbB signaling’ (Supplementary Table S4), the top scoring miR—
Trio includes miR—518b, miR—518d—3p and miR—55 lb. The miR—Duo
considers only one miR—518 as a representative. In most cases, the

associated with three miR—Trios (Wnt signaling, data not shown) or four
miR—Trios (tight junction). For a list of pathways and their miR—Trios, see
Supplementary Table S4.

overlap between the miR—Trios and miR—Duos is explained by the
selection of the repeatedly used miRNAs among the top scoring
miR—Trios (examples in Fig. 6). For example, only ﬁve top scoring
miR—Trios are associated with the KEGG pathway ‘Vascular smooth
muscle contraction’ (Supplementary Table S4). These miR—Trios
combine only ﬁve miRNAs (from a maximal of 15 combinations).
This ﬁnding further substantiates the dominant role of some miRNAs
of the pairs or triplets. Moreover, while 39/172 pathways failed to
receive positive DIS values, only 27 of these pathways were listed
for the miR—Duo analysis. For 12 of the pathways the positive DIS
value was satisﬁed by only two miRNAs (for example Cell cycle:
hsa04110, Oocyte meiosis: hsa04ll4, PPAR signaling: hsa03320,
Supplementary Table S3).

Figure 6 shows examples of the highest miR—Trios and their
miRNAs. These examples are the pathways associated with—two
to ﬁve miR—Trios. While there is no overlap in miRNAs among
different pathways, often the same miRNA repeats in the miR—Trios
of the same pathway.

For some of the examples, the same miRNA is included in three
top scoring miR—Trios. Recall that while the score of top miR—Trios
is identical, the actual number and identity of the targeted genes is
not necessarily identical.

3.8 miR-Trio regulation of Alzheimer’s disease and
Wnt signaling pathways

The biological information that is encoded in each of the 172
tested pathways is extensive. The representation of the pathway
as an undirected graph is clearly an over—simpliﬁcation. Still, we
show that even a complex pathway related to a disease state is
suitable for the miR—Trio approach. The pathway of ‘Alzheimer’s
disease’ (AD) depicts one of the most studied degenerative disease
pathway. The AD pathway focuses on parallel processes that involve

the mitochondrion, the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) stress, the
Apolipoprotein E (APOE), the Tau phosphorylation and the amyloid
precursor protein (APP) products. This is reﬂected by the pathway
graph that is composed of eight CCs (Supplementary Table S1).
Surprisingly, only one dominating miR—Trio was assigned with a
maximal impact on the disconnection of the pathway graph (miR—
487a, miR—452 and miR—625). The fragmentation of the pathway by
this miR—Trio covers all known AD related sub—processes.

The Wnt signaling pathway represents another complex pathway
that is subjected to miR—Trio manipulation. Wnt signaling operates
through the activation of membrane receptors by the Wnt soluble
ligands. Three redundant processes are known: the canonical
pathway through ,8—catenin, the non—canonical through Rho— and
Jnk—associated kinases and the activation of intracellular calcium
sensitive kinases (PKC and CAMKII). While over 22 000 miR—
Trios were tested for maximal DIS, only three miR—Trios were
selected that cover six miRNAs (Supplementary Tables S3
and S4).

Further support for the susceptibility of the Wnt signaling and
AD pathways to miR—Trios comes from testing the mouse KEGG
pathways. Recall that while the proteins of the pathways are mostly
close homologs, the regulation by miRNAs is not necessarily
equivalent as the 3’ —untranslated region of human and mouse
homologs differs signiﬁcantly. However, although the miR—Trios
are not identical for the mouse and human similar pathways, in
both organisms these are among the most sensitive pathways.
Speciﬁcally, the mouse Wnt signaling and AD pathways were
ranked 4 and 5 whereas in the human they were ranked 7 and 10,
respectively.

Recall that in most instances, there is no obvious combination of
miRNAs that are effective toward a speciﬁc pathway. A selection of
the top scoring miR—Trios is often sensitive to the parameters of the
search. Speciﬁcally, Table 2 shows the application of miRror for the
Wnt signaling pathway using several statistical thresholds and the
selection of different set of prediction resources (DBs). Note that
the parameters used drastically change the search space, but the
number of top miRNAs among the top—Trios remains limited (3—7).
We mark the miRNAs that are shared in the resulting top miR—
Trios (named dominating miRs). Note that only miR—487b appears
as dominating miRNA after changing the parameters of the analysis
(Table 2). It is shown that reducing the search space by almost
40—folds (from 20 835 to 560) led to a marginal reduction in DIS
(from 0.753 to 0.721). We conclude that the space of solutions for
disconnecting a pathway graph is rich enough to select numerous
comparable miR—Trios.

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we combine the importance of regulatory pathway
graph topology with the concept of coordinated regulation by
miRNAs. We test the notion that a small set of a combinatorial
miRNA action constitutes an effective seed for pathway’s
manipulations. The protocol applied in this study introduces several
sequential ﬁlters for the selection of few miRNAs that are potentially
effective toward a speciﬁc pathway.

As a byproduct of this study, we identiﬁed human pathways
that are not susceptible for miRNA regulation and others that are
sensitive. The later serve as an unbiased resource to test the rebalance
of miRNA combination in health and disease.

4.1 miRror algorithm drastically reduces the noise of
miRNA-target prediction

Matching a pathway with relevant miRNAs presents a challenging
problem. It is estimated that between 30% and 50% of the genes
in mammalian genomes are candidates for miRNAs regulation
(Friedman et a1., 2009; Lewis et a1., 2003). A high level of false
predictions by miRNA—gene target predicting tools, and the low
coherence among them (Mendes et a1., 2009) lead to an uncertainty
in assigning miRNAs to a speciﬁc pathway. Often each miRNA is
associated with hundreds to thousands of predicted targets (Shomron
et a1., 2009). Consequently, looking up on miRNA—targets pairs
is impractical. Applying a strict statistical signiﬁcance threshold
such as the one provided by the miRror is critical in reducing false
predictions (Friedman et a1., 2010).

In recent years several databases and tools were developed
with the notion that miRNAs regulate diseases and pathways
(Papadopoulos et a1., 2009a). However, most of these tools list
hundreds of miRNA predictions. For example, the number of the
miRNAs associated with ‘Wnt signaling’ and ‘Insulin signaling’
based on miRWalk (www.ma.uni—heidelberg.de/apps/sz/mirwalk)
is 572 and 657, respectively. In contrast, our ﬁnal step of the
procedure associated these pathways with six and four miRNAs,
respectively, (Fig. 6).

Our systematic search presents the most likely miRNA
combinations according to their ability to severely alter the integrity
of the target pathway. The apparent ranking of disconnecting human
pathways by miRNAs supports the notion that the pathway topology
is the prime determinant.

4.2 Some human pathways are resistant to
fragmentation by small sets of miRNAs

A substantial fraction of the pathways (39/172) is not suitable for
the miR—Trio approach. We propose that many of these pathways
can still be subjected to a miRNA—based regulation. Indeed, when
miRror was applied with a relaxed threshold (P—value <0.05), ~50%
of the pathways that initially were not suitable for our approach
appeared legitimate. In accord with the observation seen in Table
2, these pathways are associated with small number of top scoring
miR—Trios. The properties of these pathways are not different from
the other human pathways. We conclude that a small set of miR—
Trios can lead to fragmentation of most (87%) of the known human
pathways.

The susceptibility of human pathway to miRNA regulation was
proposed based on the enrichment in the candidate genes function
(Cui et a1., 2006). We conﬁrm that most pathways are indeed
susceptible to miRNA regulation. When a search is performed in
view of the capacity of the miR—Trios to cause a fragmentation of
speciﬁc pathways, only a small set of combinations is retrieved.
Recent technological advances for introducing several miRNAs in
a controllable manner were presented (Brown and Naldini, 2009).

4.3 The gap between the miR-Trio list and network
perturbation

We will not discuss the experimental implication that follows the
rational choice of miR—Trios. The endogenous level of miRNA
expression and the expression levels of the cognate endogenous
targets are an important determinant for miRNAs regulation
(Arvey et a1., 2010; Salmena et a1., 2011). A quantitative view on

miRNAs in viva indicates a large difference in miRNAs occurrence
(e. g. Krichevsky et a1., 2003). The estimated quantities of the level
of miRNA expression are reported in miRBase following RPT
normalization (reads per thousand) (Grifﬁths—Jones et a1., 2006).
Importantly, in our analysis we are not considering the endogenous
expression of the miRNAs in different tissues or physiological states.
We consider the miR—Trios as a pure exogenous set of miRNAs
and as a guideline for molecular manipulations (using the preferred
combinations of designed miRNAs, siRNAs or other shRNAs).

The outcome from the exhaustive search for miR—Trios is the list
of the most sensitive nodes in the pathway graphs. The stability
of short RNAs is dependent on the hybridization stability with
the target gene. In this view, miRNAs that are characterized by a
partial hybridization are often more stable in the cell with respect
to siRNAs that are designed to perfectly match the target gene
(Pasquinelli, 2010). High speciﬁcity in manipulating a desired
pathway should be considered through a siRNAs protocol (Nielsen
et a1., 2007). Under such design, one can expect a minimal off—
target effect. However, understanding the effectiveness of RNAi
technology remains an active research topic. Recently, it was
suggested that the lifetime of mRNAs is an important determinant
in the effectiveness and failure in manipulation by short RNAs
(Larsson et a1., 2010).

For this approach, the selected miRNAs from the top scoring
miR—Trios should be considered in a cellular context. In practical
terms, there are cases where the subjected cells do not express any of
the miR—Trios under consideration. In addition, recent observations
regarding miRNA as part of a larger network of interaction cannot
be ignored [see discussion in (Brown and Naldini, 2009; Ivanovska
and Cleary, 2008; Krek et a1., 2005)]. The main components that
are sensitive to molecular and cellular manipulations include: the
miRNA stability, off—target (van Dongen et a1., 2008), dilution
effects (Arvey et a1., 2010; Linsley et a1., 2007), sponge and
competition among targets (Peter, 2010; Salmena et a1., 2011), cross—
mapping (Guo et a1., 2011) and negative design (Arvey et a1., 2010).
Argonaute immunopuriﬁcation experiments reveal that endogenous
Ago2 is occupied with tens of miRNAs, some of which are at
exceptionally high amounts. Thus, compartalization must play a key
role in determine speciﬁcity (Azuma—Mukai et a1., 2008).

4.4 The search space of miR-Duos and miR-Trios

Figure 6 and Supplementary Tables S3—S4 list the top miR—Trios but
also the expansion of choosing miR—Trio among the top 5% of the
results. For about 50 pathways, such relaxation expands the selection
of miRNAs substantially (by Z2—folds). For example in ‘Chronic

myeloid leukemia’ (KEGG hsa05220), only two top scored miR—
Trios were proposed, but nine miR—Trio combinations are suggested
among the top 5% of the results. As shown in Table 2, the selection
of miR—Trios and miR—Duos is sensitive to the parameters used
in the protocol. A relaxed inspection of the top 5% of the results
is important to (i) extend the list of valid combinations, and (ii)
identifying instances for which the relaxation of the parameter
(5% top scoring) had no effect. Interestingly, for 34% (DIS > 0)
the relaxation for 5% had no effect for miR—Trios or miR—Duos
(KEGG pathways, 27/79 and 24/71 for miR—Duos and miR—Trios,
respectively). However, on average, the ratio of number of miR—
combinations with the highest DIS relative to their number in the
top 5% is 2.7 and 3.5 for miR—Duos and miR—Trios, respectively.
In a few instances, the expansion was dramatic. For example, the
‘JAK—STAT signaling pathway’ reported seven top DIS miR—Duos
and 839 when 5% top DIS is considered (18 and 17 000 for miR—
Trios, respectively). We calculated a high correlation between the
expanded lists for the miR—Duos and miR—Trios (t—test P—value =
0.0061).

We started our study by an exhaustive search for miR—Trios.
However it was apparent that for a substantial number of instances,
reducing the effective number of miRNAs to pairs or even to
apparently a single miRNA is logical. For example, four miR—
Trios are listed for Circadian rhythm—mammal (Supplementary
Table S4). Among the four miRNAs involved, three belong to
the miRNA has—mir—515 family (hsa—miR—5l9c—3p, hsa—miR—5l9a,
hsa—miR—519b—3p). Applying a miRNA family compression scheme
reduces the number of miR—Trios and the miRNAs that need to be
considered in analyzing the impact of miRNAs regulation on the
pathway.

Finally, we explored the relatively high susceptibility of most
pathways to a small set of miR—Trios. We propose that this is
not a reﬂection of targeting only a few commonly used signaling
genes. Instead, the topological property of the pathway graph
representation is a major factor in the selection of top scoring
miR—Trios. Incorporation of a network consideration to the miRNA
regulation is discussed in view of the gene interaction and epistasis
(Phillips, 2008). Our study adds an additional layer of combinatorial
view on small sets of miRNAs in view of the topology robustness
of human pathways.

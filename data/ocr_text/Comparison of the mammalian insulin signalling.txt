ABSTRACT

Motivation: A large number of experimental studies on ageing focus
on the effects of genetic perturbations of the insulin/insulin-like growth
factor signalling pathway (IIS) on lifespan. Short-lived invertebrate la-
boratory model organisms are extensively used to quickly identify
ageing-related genes and pathways. It is important to extrapolate
this knowledge to longer lived mammalian organisms, such as
mouse and eventually human, where such analyses are difficult or
impossible to perform. Computational tools are needed to integrate
and manipulate pathway knowledge in different species.

Results: We performed a literature review and curation of the IIS and
target of rapamycin signalling pathways in Mus Musculus. We com-
pare this pathway model to the equivalent models in Drosophila mel-
anogaster and Caenorhabtitis elegans. Although generally well-
conserved, they exhibit important differences. In general, the worm
and mouse pathways include a larger number of feedback loops
and interactions than the fly. We identify ‘functional orthologues’ that
share similar molecular interactions, but have moderate sequence
similarity. Finally, we incorporate the mouse model into the web-ser-
vice NetEffects and perform in silico gene perturbations of HS com-
ponents and analyses of experimental results. We identify sub-paths
that, given a mutation in an IIS component, could potentially antagon-
ize the primary effects on ageing via FOXO in mouse and via SKN-1 in
worm. Finally, we explore the effects of FOXO knockouts in three dif-
ferent mouse tissues.

1 INTRODUCTION

The insulin/insulin-like growth factor signalling pathway (IIS)
and the target of rapamycin (TOR) signalling pathway
have been shown to be important regulators of ageing across

species Via the transcription factor FOXO (Kenyon, 2011).
The mechanisms by which ‘FOXO increased activity’ leads to
lifespan extension are still unclear. However, it is thought that
lifespan extension is achieved through cell-cycle arrest by FOXO
in the absence of insulin signalling (van der Horst and Burgering,
2007). In addition, identiﬁcation of FOXO transcriptional tar-
gets has revealed a second tier of transcription factors regulating
a variety of downstream responses (Alic et al., 2011). Ageing Via
the IIS pathway has been intensively studied at the level of in-
vertebrate model laboratory organisms. With their short life-
spans, well-described genomes and a variety of mutants already
available, Drosophila melanogaster (Clancy et al., 2001) and
Caenorhabtitis elegans (Kenyon et al., 1993) provide excellent
frameworks for fast identiﬁcation of genetic determinants of
ageing. Relating results from ﬂy and worm to a longer lived
mammalian model, such as Mus musculus (Bluher et al., 2003),
is critical for the understanding of the ageing processes in human,
but it is often difficult owing to the large evolutionary distance
between invertebrates and mammals.

The general ﬂow of the pathway is as follows. The insulin and
insulin growth factor receptors can be activated by two different
insulin molecules or two insulin-like growth factor molecules.
On activation, the two receptors can activate the insulin receptor
substrates (IRSl-4) by tyrosine phosphorylation. The role of
IRSl especially has been well examined and found to propagate
the signal further downstream, Via the PI3K complex. The
phospholipid products of PI3K [phosphatidylinositol-3,4,5-tri-
phosphate (PIP3)], once produced, can activate phosphoinosi-
tide-dependent kinase-l (PDKl) that leads to the activation of
AKT/protein kinase B-like proteins (AKTl-3, with AKTl being
well studied) and serum and glucocorticoid-inducible kinases
(SGKl-3). AKTl and the SGKl-3 kinases inhibit the activity
of the Forkhead transcription factors FOXO by retaining them
in the cytoplasm.

The IIS pathway is generally well conserved, with the main
building blocks (INSR, PI3K, PDKl, AKT, FOXO) present in
both mammals and invertebrates. The TOR pathway is also well
conserved with its main building blocks present (TOR complexes
1 and 2, RHEB, S6 kinase). Important differences also exist.
There are seven known insulin molecules in the ﬂy, as opposed
to 40 in the worm. In the mouse, there are two insulin and two
insulin-like growth factors. Flies and worms possess a single in-
sulin receptor each, whereas mice possess two insulin-like growth
factor receptors in addition to the insulin receptor. In mice, we

observe more copies of certain proteins, such as four copies of
AKT (AktI-4) instead of one in the ﬂy and two in the worm and
four genes encoding FOXO (Foon, F0x02, F0x04 and F0x06) in
contrast to a single FOXO in ﬂies and worms (foxo and daf—I6).
The TOR pathway is remarkably similar between ﬂies and mice,
but exhibits differences with the worm (Ivanov et al., 2013;
Riesen et al., 2014).

Previously, we developed the web-service NetEffects to solve
the problem of relating gene expression results to their effects
at the protein signalling level of the IIS pathway and the
ageing phenotype (Papatheodorou et al., 2012). This is a
common problem of many studies on ageing that use whole
organism mutants to study changes in lifespan and uncover
protein interactions within the signalling pathways by use
of transcriptomic datasets. NetEffects uses Answer Set
Programming, a logic-based method for inference that uses
manually curated maps of the IIS pathway and its relationship
to lifespan as prior knowledge. Given a gene mutation and the
resulting genome-wide differential gene expression, NetEffects
will deduce signalling effects and how they can inﬂuence lifespan
according to the prior knowledge. Our applications on ﬂy and
worm datasets (Ivanov et al., 2013; Papatheodorou et al., 2012)
have revealed consistent homeostatic mechanisms across both
long- and short-lived mutants.

2 METHODS

The signalling network model of the IIS and TOR pathways was
built using GraphML, using the editor yEd (http://www.yworks.com).
This enabled a computationally readable representation of the pathways,
as well as a graphical Visualization that relates molecular topology
to cellular components. During the curation process, we used the insulin
pathway available in KEGG (Kanehisa et al., 2012) as a starting
point and the rest of the connections were built by literature review.
Literature searches were performed using PubMed (http://www.ncbi.
nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/) by querying mouse gene names and identiﬁers.
Only connections with experimental support, rather than just suggestive
or hypothetical, were used. Protein—protein interactions from yeast two-
hybrid system or other screens were omitted. Supporting literature for
each relationship is available by clicking on the pathway connections
within NetEffects.

All graphs from the comparative analyses across the ﬂy, worm and
mouse pathways were produced by custom-made R (http://www.r-pro-
ject.org/) scripts. These cross-species analyses were based on genomic
sequence-based orthologous relationships, downloaded from Ensembl
Compara (http://www.ensembl.org). Orthology relationships that were
not predicted by Compara but were suggested by the topology and con-
nectivity of the genes in the pathway models, were sought in TreeFam
(http://www.treefam.org/), OrthoDB (http://cegg.unige.ch/orthodb7) and
Phylome (http://phylomedb.org/).

The mouse pathway was incorporated to the web-service
NetEffects, built using PHP (PHP: Hypertext Preprocessor), JavaScript
and Perl. Proteins on the pathway have been annotated with Ensembl
identiﬁers to enable the import and analysis of experimental datasets. The
‘theoretical perturbations’ option of NetEffects was used to query the
pathway and produce inferences on the possible paths to longevity
from different mutations. The ‘Experimental Results Analysis’ option
was used to analyse the gene expression datasets. Raw ﬁles of the expres-
sion datasets in Paik et al. (2007) were analysed using the Lima package
in R (Smyth, 2005).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

3.1 A model of the insulin and TOR signalling pathways
for M.musculus

We curated a model of the IIS, TOR and neighbouring pathways
in the mouse, providing access to the underlying literature as
clickable connections on the pathway within the web-service.

We found the IIS pathway to be well connected and to include
several points of cross-talks with neighbouring pathways. This
enables it to respond to signals from a variety of sources rather
than just extracellular insulin molecules. IRS and SHCl bind to
GRB2, which then activates the MAPK/ERK pathway. In add-
ition to propagating insulin signals, IRS also receives feedback
from other pathways, such as TOR by inhibition from S6 kinase
(gene name Rpsokbl), JNK by inhibition from JNKl and Wnt
signalling through an inhibition by GSK3-beta. SHCl is phos-
phorylated by the activated Insulin receptor, propagating the
signal to MAPK/ERK Via GRB2, SOSl and SOS2. AKTl pro-
vides another point of cross-talk with the TOR pathway, by
directly inhibiting PRAS40, which then inhibits RPTOR, inhibit-
ing TSC2. AKTl can also be activated by TOR complex 2.

Previous work on mouse mutants of the IIS and TOR signal-
ling pathways have clearly shown a role for the insulin pathway
in the regulation of lifespan, with null S6K (Sehnan et al., 2009)
mice and null IRS-l (Selman et al., 2008) mice showing signiﬁ-
cant lifespan extension when compared with wild-type. Although
there is so far no experimental conﬁrmation of lifespan regula-
tion by mammalian FOXOs, results from mice lacking one or
more of FoxOI, F0x03 and F0x04 have revealed ageing-related
phenotypes, such as reduced bone mass (Ambrogini et al., 2010)
and the development of ageing-related diseases like thymic
lymphomas, hemangiomas (Paik et al., 2007). These results sug-
gest that mammalian FoxOs play a protective role against age-
related diseases. In addition, Willcox et al. (2008) provide evi-
dence for F0x03A genetic variation being associated with life-
span in a large, well-phenotyped cohort of humans through a
case—control study of ﬁve candidate genes.

3.2 Comparison of insulin and TOR signalling in ﬂy,
worm and mouse

With the availability of thoroughly curated pathway models for
each of the three species, we are now able to make comparisons
of their components and connections. Supplementary Table S2
summarizes the similarities and differences between the IIS and
TOR pathway molecules across the three different species.
Figure 1 presents on the mouse IIS and TOR pathway model
the occurrence of ﬂy and/or worm orthologues, also present in
the species-speciﬁc models.

‘Functional orthologues’ were also identiﬁed, where sequence
similarity across species is moderate but molecular interactions
and experimental evidence suggest that these pairs are indeed
orthologues. Such cases include ist-I, a worm orthologue to
the IRS (OrthoDB); drr—2, a worm orthologue to eukaryotic
translation initiation factors 4H (Ching et al., 2010) and 4B
(Phylome Orthology); unc-5I, worm orthologue to Ulkl/Atgl;
let-363, worm orthologue to M tor (TreeFam) and age-I, worm
orthologue to Pik3ca (TreeFam). Gene Deptor encodes a protein
associated with the mammalian TORCl that is absent from the

ﬂy and worm genomes. Glatter et al. (2011) hypothesized that
the gene appeared later in vertebrate evolution.

In general, the IIS and TOR pathways in the mouse appear
considerably larger and with more cross-talk (see Supplementary
Section S3). This effect is partly because of the fact that the IIS
and TOR pathways in the mouse have been more thoroughly
studied, as well as to the different extents of the curation of the
neighbouring pathways within each organism. Being used as a
model organism for studies on human diseases such as cancer
and diabetes and with the availability of a large number of
murine cell lines, more interactions within and between the IIS,
TOR and their neighbouring pathways have been discovered.

Cross-talk points between the IIS and TOR pathway include
interactions between AKTl and TORC2 in all three organisms,
as well as RPS6KBA (S6 kinase) and IRSl in mouse and ﬂy. In
the mouse, both AKT and IRS involve several paralogous
copies. The IRS genes in the mouse are also involved in the
cross-talk between JNK and IIS pathways, an interaction that
is conserved across species. In some cases, the interactions be-
tween neighbouring pathways are not conserved due to the lack
of orthologues in worms or ﬂies or both. For example, there is no
orthologue for TSC2 in the worm which is inhibited by AKT in
ﬂies and mice. There are also cases where orthologues in the
invertebrates exist, but the interactions have not been observed
experimentally as exempliﬁed by the interaction of IIS and

MAPK/ERK pathways Via GRB2 and SOSl. Finally in the
case of MAPK/ERK to TOR cross-talk, facilitated by the acti-
vation of RPS6KA1 by MAPKl in the mouse, we found ortho-
logues in both other organisms but no interaction in the ﬂy.
In the worm, there is evidence for a protein—protein interaction
between them (see Supplementary Section S3D for the complete
table of cross-talk points).

3.3 Paths to FOXO-mediated longevity with NetEffects

We incorporated the mouse pathway model into the web service
NetEffects (Papatheodorou et al., 2012) to enable computational
analyses. We can now compare the effects on FOXO-mediated
ageing across the three species. Using the ‘theoretical perturb-
ations’ functionality, we tested the paths to FOXO-mediated
longevity in the mouse and worm from already known mutants
in ﬂies (see Supplementary Section S4 for full results). Knocking
out Ins] or Ins2 in mouse results in a path consistent with those
obtained when doing the equivalent test in the ﬂy and worm
models (Table 1). This leads to increased lifespan through inhib-
ition of AKT, which then allows translocation of FOXO into the
nucleus. However, in mouse and worm, we also encounter paths
that reduce longevity. In the mouse, this path involves the IGFl-
receptor and RACKl (gene an2l) that leads to enhanced AKT
phosphorylation and activation. This effect, however, appears
to be cell-type—speciﬁc and probably also context-speciﬁc, as

described in Kiely et al. (2005). In the worm, there is also an
effect that might be antagonizing the FOXO-mediated lifespan
increase, but is mediated by LET-60 (Kras orthologue) and the
transcription factor SKN-l. Similar effects were produced when
IgfIr was mutated. Mutation of Insr had similar results to the
equivalent manipulations in the ﬂy and worm.

We also tested known mouse mutants in the IIS pathway that
affect lifespan. The IrsIT/T mutant (Sehnan et al., 2008) results in
a long-lived phenotype, as expected from previous knockout ex-
periments on the ﬂy orthologue Chico (Clancy et al., 2001). In
contrast, the IrsT/T mutant is short-lived (Selman et al., 2008).
NetEffects infers similar paths for both IrsIT/T and IrsT/T mu-
tants, as they exhibit similar connections to other components of
the IIS and TOR pathways (Table l). The shortest path that
leads to increase in lifespan involves inhibition of AKT. The
shortest paths leading to a reduction of lifespan require increased
activity of GSK3B leading to inhibition of FOXO Via SIRTl and
E2Fl. Functional experiments, as well as genome-wide gene
expression in the two mutants could show whether IrsT/T mutant
mice reduce their lifespan Via a different route, and whether the
activity of GSK3B plays a role. We also tested ist-I, the func-
tional worm orthologue for [rs] and Irs2, where a knockout
experiment with lifespan analysis has not been performed. In
addition to the FOXO-mediated lifespan extension, we obtained
a sub-path of the same antagonistic effect Via SKN—l as in the
INSl/2 tests shown above. Partial support for the opposing
effect of LET-60 (RAS) Via SKN—l to FOXO-mediated lifespan
extension comes from a study on long-lived age-I (PI3K) worms,
where downregulation of let-60 and skn-I genes was observed
(Tazearslan et al., 2009).

Finally, we analysed the expression datasets in cells derived
from three different tissues of null and conditional alleles in the
three main Foxo genes (FoxOIT/‘I; FoxOSE/T; FoxOf/T). The
datasets were generated by Paik et al. (2007). We analysed the
F 0x0 mutants in liver and lung endothelial cells and thymus cells.

According to the authors, liver cells presented cancer-related
phenotypes, whereas lung cells did not present a detectable
phenotype. With NetEffects we can show that 16 genes within
the pathway model are differentially expressed in liver, one in
lung and three in thymus (excluding the three Foxo genes that
have been knocked out). Ahnost all of the shortest paths starting
from these differentially expressed genes correspond to negative
feedback to the mutation of Foxo genes, as shown by the pre-
dicted impact on lifespan (Supplementary Section S5). This sug-
gests that the function of the three Foxo genes plays a greater
part in the liver and thymus rather than in lung endothelial cells.
Similar negative feedback was identiﬁed in our previous analyses
of Foxo null mutants in the ﬂy Papatheodorou et al. (2012).

4 CONCLUSION

The molecular basis of nutrient signalling is largely comparable
across a large evolutionary space, despite striking differences in
the presence or number of copies of certain components between
species. The pathways, in all organisms except worm focus
only on FOXO-mediated lifespan, thereby ignoring any effects
through different transcription factors. However, using the
mouse pathway, we can identify neighbouring signalling path-
ways with the potential to inﬂuence the signal transduction of
the IIS through the identiﬁed cross-talk points. Comparison
of the pathways in a systematic and qualitative way has the po-
tential to explain differences in effects on lifespan across species
and help design experiments that will evaluate the pathway ﬂux.
The richness and detail of the mammalian model can inform
the interpretation of results in invertebrates, where molecular
interactions have not been so extensively studied. Being able to
compare the pathways side by side, we recorded all differences
and identiﬁed “functional orthologues’. By use of NetEffects, we
were able to suggest possible paths affecting FOXO-mediated

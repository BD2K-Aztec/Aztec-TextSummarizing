Abstract

Motivation: Identifying the shared and pathogen—specific components of host transcriptional regu—
latory programs is important for understanding the principles of regulation of immune response.
Recent efforts in systems biology studies of infectious diseases have resulted in a large collection
of datasets measuring host transcriptional response to various pathogens. Computational methods
to identify and compare gene expression modules across different infections offer a powerful way
to identify strain—specific and shared components of the regulatory program. An important chal—
lenge is to identify statistically robust gene expression modules as well as to reliably detect genes
that change their module memberships between infections.

Results: We present MULCCH (MULti—task spectral Consensus Clustering for Hierarchically related
tasks), a consensus extension of a multi—task clustering algorithm to infer high—confidence strain—
specific host response modules under infections from multiple virus strains. On simulated data,
MULCCH more accurately identifies genes exhibiting pathogen—specific patterns compared to non—
consensus and nonmulti—task clustering approaches. Application of MULCCH to mammalian tran—
scriptional response to a panel of influenza viruses showed that our method identifies clusters with
greater coherence compared to non—consensus methods. Further, MULCCH derived clusters are
enriched for several immune system—related processes and regulators. In summary, MULCCH pro—
vides a reliable module—based approach to identify molecular pathways and gene sets characteriz—
ing commonality and specificity of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities.

1 Introduction

Transcriptional regulatory networks play an important role in driv—
ing genome-wide mRNA levels in dynamic biological processes,
such as response to stress or pathogenic infections. Identification of
unique and shared components of transcriptional regulatory net—
works can be useful for designing more sensitive therapeutics or to
exploit shared vulnerabilities of the immune system. Recently, com—
pendia of genome—wide mRNA levels measuring mammalian host
response have become available for multiple related conditions that
represent responses to similar types of infections (e.g. different
inﬂuenza viruses) or from similar diseases (e.g. different respiratory
diseases; Aevermann et al., 2014). Such datasets can be computa—
tionally interrogated to identify common and pathogen—specific
components of transcriptional regulatory networks. Transcriptional
regulatory networks exhibit a modular organization, defined by sets
of genes that are co—expressed under different environmental condi-
tions (Bonneau et al., 2006; Ihmels et al., 2002; Marzorati et al.,
2008; Polanski et al., 2014; Segal et al., 2003). Thus a module—based
analysis for each condition, followed by a comparison of module
patterns across conditions, can provide a systematic identification of
the major patterns of conserved and condition—specific transcrip-
tional response between different conditions. Differentially respond-
ing genes can be identified as those genes that change their module
assignments between conditions. To study condition—specific mod—
ules and identify genes that switch module assignments, we need a
correspondence between modules across multiple conditions, and,
be able to identify statistically robust changes in module assignments
between conditions. Consensus clustering is an established proced—
ure for improving the robustness of clustering algorithms (Monti
et al., 2003), which are typically used for module identification.
However, consensus clustering has thus far not been applied to mod—
ule identification across multiple conditions. A second challenge is
that the individual conditions themselves might be related, which if
exploited can improve the confidence in detecting shared and con—
text—specific patterns (Kirk et al., 2012). A third related challenge is
that identification of differentially responding genes using module—
based analysis have typically focused on two conditions (Amar
et al., 2013), however, as the number of conditions increase, it is im-
portant to find sets of genes that might be induced in a subset of con—
ditions but repressed in another subset.

To reliably identify condition—specific and common patterns of
expression across multiple conditions, such as infection to multiple
viruses, we propose MULti—task spectral Consensus Clustering for
Hierarchically related tasks (MULCCH), a new consensus clustering
extension for existing multi—task clustering algorithms. Multi—task
clustering provides a principled machine-learning framework to
cluster multiple datasets, one from each condition, simultaneously
(Caruana, 1997). Each dataset from a condition is viewed as a separ—
ate task, and is clustered separately while information is shared be-
tween the tasks. Multi—task extensions have been developed for
specific clustering algorithms, including k—means (Cai et al., 2013)
and mixture models (Bickel and Scheffer, 2004; Roy et al., 2013).
Multi—task clustering frameworks can provide a correspondence be—
tween the clusters across the datasets, making it straightforward to
identify gene sets that respond in a conserved manner across the con—
ditions. Here we provide a consensus clustering extension to an
existing multi-task clustering algorithm Arboretum, (Roy et al.,
2013), which additionally exploits hierarchical relationships among
the clustering tasks (Section 2). Arboretum is a Gaussian mixture
model—based multi—task clustering approach that infers modules of
co—expressed genes from multiple gene expression datasets, while

incorporating the hierarchical relationships across different condi—
tions. The Arboretum algorithm was originally applied to expression
datasets from different species in a phylogeny, but is broadly applic—
able to multi—task clustering problems that are related by a hier—
archy. The consensus clustering component of our approach relies
on spectral clustering (Von Luxburg, 2007), which is applicable for
clustering entities related by a graph. We represent an ensemble of
multiple clusterings of the same dataset as a weighted graph of
genes, with edge weights representing the confidence of gene pairs
that are in the same cluster.

We compared our method to other existing clustering algorithms
using simulated and real expression data. We evaluated the algo—
rithms based on well—established measures of cluster quality, as well
as new criteria that are important for identifying condition-specific
(e.g. virus—specific and strain—specific) genes. Based on simulations,
we found that MULCCH and consensus versions of tested clustering
algorithms dominated most other clustering algorithms in terms of
cluster quality and ability to accurately detect genes that change
module assignments. We applied our approach to measurements of
host transcriptional response to influenza virus infections in human
Calu—3 cell line and mouse lung samples (Aevermann et al., 2014).
Our results identified modules with common and pathogenicity—spe—
cific patterns that are associated with various immune response
processes. Taken together, our approach provides a systematic way
to detect common and condition—specific patterns of transcriptional
response across multiple conditions, while exploiting known rela-
tionships among the conditions.

2 Methods

2.1 Multi—task consensus clustering approach for
hierarchically related contexts

To identify common and condition—specific patterns of transcrip—
tional response from different conditions (e.g. host response to di—
verse viral infections), we developed MULCCH, a multi—task
spectral consensus clustering approach. MULCCH accomplishes
two goals: (i) identify high—confidence gene modules in each condi—
tion and (ii) reliably detect genes that transition between modules
from different conditions.

Our approach extends an existing multi—task Gaussian mixture
model—based algorithm, Arboretum (Roy et al., 2013). The inputs to
Arboretum are (i) a set of gene expression datasets, one for each
condition, (ii) a binary tree that describes the relationship between
the conditions represented by the datasets and (iii) a desired number
of clusters, 13. The parameters of Arboretum include transition
matrices for each branch in the tree to model the tendency for genes
to maintain or switch their assignments from the parent, and the
mixture model parameters. These parameters are learned using ex—
pectation maximization (EM). The clustering produced by
Arboretum gives 13 clusters for each condition, mapped one—to—one
between conditions, which enables easy identification of both co—ex—
pression patterns and genes that switch their module membership
between conditions. Genes that switch modules between different
sets of conditions can indicate pathways associated with strain and
pathogen—specific responses.

Figure 1 illustrates our entire approach with a simple example of
three datasets, one each for a pathogenic virus (Fig. 1(1)). The rela-
tive similarities between the viruses are represented by the tree struc—
ture. Our consensus clustering procedure starts by running
Arboretum many times separately with different initializations. In
an individual Arboretum model, each leaf node represents one

Fig. 1. Overview of MULCCH: MULti-task spectral Consensus Clustering for
Hierarchically related tasks. Shown is an example of clusters learned in three
conditions representing infections from three viruses of different pathogenic-
ities: H1N1, H5N1, PB1-F2Del. This figure shows the framework of our spec-
tral consensus clustering approach for five genes, A-E. For each condition,
Arboretum clusters genes into k modules, k = 2 in this example. The main
steps of MULCCH are (1) Run Arboretum multiple times on the same datasets
to generate multiple clustering solutions; (2) Generate a consensus graph for
each condition by evaluating the co-clustering frequency of pairs of genes,
thickness of the edge denoting different gene co-clustering frequencies; (3)
Extract the top k eigenvectors from each consensus graph; (4) Apply
Arboretum again to obtain final consensus clustering

condition, and a Gaussian mixture with 13 components models the
expression data of each module at the leaf node. In Figure 1(1),
Arboretum is shown to produce [a = 2 clusters for each of the condi—
tions. Next, consensus clustering is approached as a spectral cluster—
ing problem, which we describe in more detail in the next section.
We obtain one consensus graph over genes for each infection condi-
tion (Fig. 1(2)), where the edges in each graph are weighted by the
frequency at which genes are co—clustered in that condition. We then
compute eigenvectors from the Laplacian of the graph for each con-
dition, and use them to generate new data vectors for that condition
Figure 1(3). See Supplementary Materials for details. Finally, we run
Arboretum on the new data vectors to obtain a consensus multi—task
clustering Figure 1(4) consisting of 13 clusters per virus infection,
with a one—to—one mapping between the clusters. Note that gene C
exhibits an example of module transition between the pathogenicity
groups: it is clustered into Module 1 for H5N1 and PB1-F2del virus
infections, and Module 2 for the H1N1 virus infection.

2.2 Spectral consensus clustering

Consensus clustering obtains a consensus result from multiple runs
of a clustering algorithm. Our consensus clustering approach relies
on spectral clustering (Von Luxburg, 2007), an approach well—suited
for clustering entities connected by a graph. We first define a
weighted graph of genes to summarize the co—clustering relation—
ships of genes for each condition and apply spectral clustering to
this graph.

Let x1,  ,xn denote the set of genes to be clustered. Suppose
we run a clustering algorithm m times (typically, m = 50). For every
pair of genes clustered, we compute a co—clustering index defined as
the fraction of times genes 1' and j are in the same cluster, divided by
m. We represent the co—clustering relationship between all pairs of
genes using a weighted graph G = (V, Each vertex v,- in this

graph is a gene, and each edge is weighted by the co—clustering index
between the two genes.

Given a graph, G, spectral clustering makes use of the eigen—
values of the Laplacian matrix of the graph. The Laplacian is a spe—
cial operator on the graph which is inherently tied to the topology of
the graph (Qin and Rohe, 2013; Von Luxburg, 2007). Following
(Mohar and Alavi, 1991), we use the symmetric normalized graph
Laplacian defined as:

Lsym = D‘l/ZLD‘l/Z = I — D—l/ZAD—l/2

where D is an n x 11 diagonal degree matrix, each entry D(i, i) is the
degree of a vertex, and A is the adjacency matrix, with each entry
A(i, j) specifying the status of the edge from i to 1'. To obtain [a clus—
,uk of Lsym. Let U
E R"Xk be the matrix containing the vector 141, 

ters, we compute the first [a eigenvectors 141, . . .
,uk as columns.
For i : 1, . .. ,n let y,- E Rk be the 1th row of U, which is our new
data point. Spectral clustering entails applying the K—means cluster-
ing algorithm on the new data points 321, . . . ,3)". However, instead
of applying K-means independently to each graph, we apply
Arboretum to the sets of eigen vectors (Supplementary Materials).

We considered two versions of the graph to represent the co—clus—
tering relationships: a binary graph and a weighted graph. We create
a binary graph by applying a threshold, '5, on the co—clustering index.
In the binary graph, we keep edges with weights above that thresh—
old, and set all the weights to be 1. In the weighted graph version,
we keep edges weighted above the threshold, but exclude edges with
weights below the threshold '5. We experimentally examined differ-
ent values of ‘E = {0, 0.1, 0.3, 0.5, 0.7}. ‘E = 0 means that we keep
all weighted edges to produce a fully connected weighted graph.
Based on multiple cluster evaluation criteria, we determined that a
fully connected weighted graph provides the best results
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

2.3 Dataset description

We applied our method to expression data measuring host response
to six inﬂuenza viruses in two host systems: human Calu—3 cell line
(GEO Accessions GSE28166, GSE37571, GSE40844, GSE40844,
GSE43203, GSE43204) and lungs of 20—week old C57BL/6 mice
(GSE33263, GSE37569, GSE37572, GSE43301, GSE44441,
GSE44445). The mouse dataset comprised a time series of three or
four samples per virus strain and the human cell—line dataset com—
prised six to nine samples per strain. Values were normalized to
paired time points from a mock treatment. Each virus infection rep—
resented a different condition.

For the human cell line data, the viruses included three wild—type
strains and three laboratory—generated mutants. The wild—type
viruses included two low—pathogenicity strains of H1N1, N
California/04/2009 (H1N1) and A/Netherlands/602/2009 (NL), and
one high-pathogenicity strain of H5N1, A/Vietnam/1203/2004
(H5 N1). The other three viruses were laboratory—generated mutants
of H5N1: PB2-627E, NS1trunc124 and PB1-F2del. PB2-627E has a
mutation in the PB2 protein that reduces the virus’s ability to repli—
cate in mammals. NS1trunc124 has a shortened version of the NS1
protein that hampers the virus’s ability to suppress the host antiviral
response. PB1-F2del is missing PB1 entirely, which interferes with
various viral functions. The mouse data included two wild—type
strains, H1N1 and H5N1 and four H5N1 mutant strains. In add—
ition to the mutants mentioned above, there was a mouse—only low—
pathogenicity strain, HAavir, which exhibits altered tissue tropism
compared to wild—type H5N1.

We modeled the relationship among the viruses according to
their pathogenicity. Although the Arboretum algorithm was de—
veloped for expression data from multiple species in a phylogeny, it
can be applied to any hierarchically related set of datasets. Our mo—
tivation for using the pathogenicity tree was to enable a systematic
comparison of host response to viruses of different pathogenicities.
Because several of the viruses were mutant strains of the same wild—
type virus, a phylogenetic tree capturing the sequence divergence of
different viruses may not reflect the pathogenicity of the virus,
which is measured in the host system. Pathogenicity is measured by
minimum lethal dose 50 (MLD50), the dose that is lethal to 50% of
infected mice (Tchitchek et al., 2013). Higher doses indicate lower
pathogenicity. The viruses represent different groups of pathogen—
icity: low (H1N1 and NL), medium (PB2-627E and NS1trunc124)
and high (H5N1 and PB1-F2del). The pathogenicity tree used in our
analysis connected the high and medium pathogenicity viruses first,
and then connected the root of these two groups with the low patho—
genicity group.

We applied an initial pre—processing on the original expression
data to focus on genes that have orthologs between human and
mouse, and that were differentially expressed between two patho—
genicity groups in either species. We assessed differential expression
with a T—test, P < 0.01 for human and P < 0.05 for mouse. We
chose these different thresholds to obtain similar number of genes
for each host system, P < 0.05 being too generous for the human
cell line data and P < 0.01 being too restrictive for the more hetero—
geneous mouse data. These thresholds created a dataset of 7192
human genes and 7240 mouse genes.

2.4 Simulation experiments

We used simulations to evaluate our multi—task consensus clustering
approach for two properties: (i) the ability of consensus clustering to
recover better clusters and (ii) the ability to reliably detect genes that
switch between clusters from different strains. We used Arboretum’s
generative model to simulate expression datasets along with simu—
lated true cluster assignments. Using those cluster assignments, we
then identified genes that transitioned between clusters for pairs of
conditions. The parameters of Arboretum’s generative model were
learned from the real human cell line expression data with k = 5
clusters (covering 7192 genes). Therefore, the simulated data had
the same structure as the real expression data, with six viruses each
contributing a short time course. In order to ensure that the simu—
lated data had good cluster separation, we first generated ten simu—
lated datasets and sorted them based on average silhouette index, a
measure of cluster separation. We used the two simulated datasets
with the best cluster separation for our experiments.

2.5 Evaluation of clusters and transitions between
clusters

We used multiple cluster evaluation criteria to assess the quality of
clusters from different consensus, non—consensus, multi—task and
nonmulti—task settings. These include (i) silhouette index, (ii) module
stability and (iii) expression coherence. Silhouette index is computed
for each data point i and measures the sharpness of boundaries of
#65:)”, where a,- is the average dissimilarity of i
with all other data points in i’s cluster and b,- is the average dissimi—

the clustering as

larity of i to the next best cluster of which i is not a member. We
used two distance measures to measure the dissimilarity of genes:
Euclidean distance and Pearson correlation. The larger the silhouette
index, the better the clustering. Cluster stability is defined as the
proportion of gene pairs that are in the same module under different

initializations. Expression coherence is defined as the average pro—
portion of genes whose expression profile has >0.8 correlation with
the module’s mean.

We introduced a fourth evaluation to measure the ability of each
method to detect genes that change their module between different
conditions. An important property of our multi—task clustering ap—
proach is that it outputs a one—to—one mapping between clusters
from multiple clustering tasks. This is beneficial because the cluster
ID then corresponds to a phenotype (pattern) of expression that can
be compared across multiple conditions. In particular, the transi-
tions of a gene between different clusters across conditions is indica—
tive of differential expression. In order to test the ability of our
method to reliably detect such transitions between different clusters,
we used the simulated data described above. The simulated datasets
provide the correct cluster assignment and are used to evaluate a
clustering method’s ability to detect true transitions in modules be—
tween any pair of conditions. We used precision, recall and F—score
to quantify the predicted switched genes/transitions between each
pair of conditions. Let Sag, denote the set of genes that transition
their cluster assignment between conditions, a and b, and let S2,), rep—
resent the set of genes predicted to transition between clusters
inferred using the data from conditions a and (9. Precision, Pab, for

score is . For all three measuarbes, higher values mean better
results.

While Arboretum provides a natural mapping of cluster IDs
across different conditions, the standard Gaussian mixture model
does not. We mapped the clusters IDs between different conditions
by computing a mean and variance value for each cluster and then
applying the Hungarian matching algorithm with Euclidean dis-
tance. Because each strain had different number of experimental
time points, we collapsed the per time point mean and variance to
the average across time points.

2.6 Number of clusters

For all clusterings, we set 12, the desired number of clusters, to five.
We evaluated our choice by empirically trying to learn [a from the
range {5, 6, 7}. We found that five clusters performed the best based
on the silhouette index and the ability to match cluster patterns be—
tween virus strains (Supplementary Table S1). This choice was also
motivated by our particular datasets, in which the expression values
of each gene tended to be constant or change monotonically over
time within each viral infection. Clustering can then be seen as an
extension of differential expression assessment. Instead of dividing
genes into only two clusters (differentially expressed and not), a
five—way clustering divides genes according to both sign of expres—
sion change and magnitude.

2.7 Clustering algorithms assessed

We compared several configurations of clustering algorithms that
differed in whether they performed multi—task or consensus cluster—
ing, or how they performed consensus clustering. To assess the ad—
vantage of multi—task clustering over single task clustering in the
context of immune response to infection from multiple influenza
virus strains, we compared the original Arboretum to independent
Gaussian mixture models (GMMs). The Arboretum algorithm was
already shown to be more advantageous than traditional clustering
in a multi—species context (Roy et al., 2013); here our experiments
tested this property in the application of multi—task learning to ana-
lyze multiple host response datasets. To assess methods of extracting
consensus clusters from repeated clustering runs, we compared

spectral clustering to hierarchical clustering, which has been previ-
ously used for consensus clustering (Nguyen and Caruana, 2007). In
both cases, we used the consensus edge weights as pairwise similar-
ities between data points. In all cases, GMM clustering was used as
the base line clustering algorithm. The complete set of tested config—

urations are:

° GMM (separate clustering for each of the conditions; neither
multi-task nor consensus)

° Arboretum (multi—task clustering, non—consensus)

° MULCCH (multi—task clustering with spectral consensus
clustering)

° Consensus GMM with spectral clustering (single task clustering
for each condition independently, with spectral consensus
clustering)

° Consensus GMM with hierarchical clustering (single task cluster—
ing for each condition independently, with hierarchical consen—
sus clustering)

2.8 Analysis of host—response modules

Enrichment of modules for curated gene sets was tested using a
hypergeometric test followed by Benjamini Hochberg correction for
multiple hypothesis correction. A corrected P—value <0.05 threshold
was used to call a module enriched in a process. The same criteria
was applied to gene sets exhibiting the same pattern of module re—
assignment between pathogenicity groups. To assess significance of
module similarity and reassignment of genes we defined a score 55-”,
for module 1' of strain X and module j of another strain Y,
Sfl-{Y : w. Here [)1 and [)2 are from a hypergeometric test
of overlap significance. Pairs of modules with a score Sfl-{Y > 20 are
discussed in the text which corresponds to P—value <1E-8. These
score values are displayed for all pairs of viruses in Figure 5B and

Supplementary Figure 85B.

3 Results

3.1 Multi—task consensus clustering can more reliably
detect transitions between modules

We first compared the ability of the clustering algorithms to reliably
detect transitions between pairs of conditions using simulated data.
We compared Arboretum, MULCCH, GMM, and Consensus
GMM by computing precision, recall and F—score to evaluate the
predicted transitions between pair of strains. For six different

. 6 . . . .
strains, there are ( 2 poss1ble combinations. F—scores are shown in

Figure 2 as 15 box plot pairs and precision and recall shown in
Supplementary Figure S2. Each subplot shows the distribution of
F—score given by different algorithms for the switches between a pair
of conditions estimated from 50 runs of each algorithm.
We observed that for most of these 15 comparisons, the MULCCH
F—scores are much higher than the average line of Arboretum, which
supports that MULCCH performs better than Arboretum in terms
of the ability to predict switched genes. On the other hand, the
F—scores of Consensus GMM are located about the same height as
the average of GMM for most of 15 runs; that is, we did not see
much improvement of Consensus GMM compared with GMM. A
similar result is also found for another simulated dataset
(Supplementary Fig. S3), in which MULCCH dominated Arboretum
while Consensus GMM performed about as well as or better
than GMM. Importantly, MULCCH performed better than non—
consensus clustering (either Arboretum or GMM), suggesting that

Fig. 2. Comparison of consensus and non-consensus clustering methods for
reliably detecting cluster transitions. Each subplot shows a comparison of a
pair of viruses: H1N1, H5N1, HAavir, PBZ-627E, NS1trunc124, and PB1-F2del.
Box plots represent the distribution of F-score of 50 runs each for four meth-
ods compared: two non-consensus methods (Arboretum and GMM) and two
consensus methods (MULCCH and consensus GMM). The higher the F-score
the better the ability to detect cluster transitions between different virus
strains

the multi—task framework together with the consensus clustering
framework enables us to infer high—confidence cluster transitions.

3.2 Spectral consensus clustering produces better
clusters than hierarchical consensus clustering

We next compared spectral consensus clustering (using either
Consensus GMM or MULCCH) against Hierarchical Consensus
Clustering (Section 2). We performed these comparisons on the real
expression data measuring genome—wide transcriptome levels in
Calu—3 cells under infection with inﬂuenza viruses of different path-
ogenicities (Section 2.3). Specifically, we applied Arboretum,
MULCCH, Consensus GMM, GMM and Consensus Hierarchical
clustering algorithms on the six inﬂuenza expression time courses
and used silhouette index to evaluate the clustering quality. We used
two measures of dissimilarity between pair of genes: Pearson correl—
ation distance (Fig. 3) and Euclidean distance (Supplementary Fig.
S4). We found that both consensus and non—consensus GMM and
Arboretum yielded similarly good results, except for on one virus,
PB2-627E. For that virus, Consensus GMM produced better cluster—
ing (see second row, first column). On the other hand, consensus
hierarchical clustering performed the worst compared to all others.
We found similar results using Euclidean distance (Supplementary
Fig. S4). These results suggest that the specific strategy used to ex—
tract consensus clusters from multiple clustering results can greatly
inﬂuence the results. Importantly, our graph—based spectral cluster—
ing approach performed significantly better than the hierarchical
clustering approach.

3.3 Consensus clustering identifies high quality and

stable clusters compared to non—consensus approaches
We next compared the clustering results using two additional met—
rics: (i) expression coherence (Fig. 4A, C) and (ii) module stability
(Fig. 4B, D). Consensus methods performed well in all measures.

Fig. 4. Comparison of MULCCH to other clustering algorithms. MULCCH (dark
blue), Consensus GMM (green), Arboretum (light blue), GMM (brown) and
Hierarchical Consensus Clustering (yellow) were compared on the basis of
expression coherence (A,C) and module stability (B,D). (A) shows expression
coherence measured as the average proportion of genes whose expression
profiles had >0.8 correlation with the module's mean using correlation dis-
tance; (B) shows stability, which measured the proportion gene pairs that are
in the same module under different random initializations. (C) Averaged co-
herence over all six strains; (D) Averaged stability over all six strains.
Hierarchical clustering will always have a stability of 1 and is therefore not
shown in B and D

First, modules inferred by consensus methods were more stable or at
least as stable as non—consensus methods for four of the six strains
(H1N1, NL, PB2-627E, PB1-F2del). MULCCH displays much bet—
ter stability than simple Arboretum, as shown by the large difference
in the proportion of consistently co—clustered gene pairs (dark blue

bars compared to light blue bars in Fig. 4). Second, in terms of ex-
pression coherence, Consensus GMM achieved the best result for all
six strains among these four methods. MULCCH produced equally
coherent modules as non—consensus Arboretum. In summary, com-
pared to a non—multi task approach (consensus GMM), MULCCH
recovers more accurate module transitions, and compared to a
nonconsensus approach (Arboretum), MULCCH has higher stability
and silhouette index, maintaining the same levels of expression co—
herence. Thus, combining multi—task and consensus clustering
makes MULCCH an overall more powerful approach than trad—

itional clustering as well as their consensus versions.

3.4 Shared immune response modules across viral
infections

We applied our method to human and mouse expression data meas—
uring transcriptional response under infection to influenza virus
strains of different pathogenicities (Section 2.3). Figure 5A shows
the modules identified from the human Calu—3 cell—line data. In all
six viruses, we observed five major patterns of expression: strong re—
pression (modules 0 and 1), mild repression (module ID 2), moder-
ate induction (module ID 3) and strong induction (module ID 4).
We observed similar patterns of expression in mouse lung as well,
although mouse modules exhibited greater similarity in the expres-
sion patterns (Supplementary Fig. SSA).

Although the general pattern of expression is similar for modules
of the same ID, the genes within each module might not be same. To
this end we assessed the significance of module overlap between
pairs of viruses (Section 2, Fig. 5B and Supplementary Fig. 85B).
When modules of the same ID exhibit high overlap, matrices in
Figure 5B have strong diagonals. All pairs of strains exhibit strong

diagonal elements, suggesting that there are common genes between
the same module IDs in different conditions. We also observe off—di—
agonal elements in some human modules. This suggests that the spe—
cific genes assigned to the same module ID across two conditions
are generally the same, however, there are several genes that switch
their module assignments (e.g. genes that switch from module 4 to 5
between H1N1 and NL, Fig. 5B).

To biologically interpret these modules we tested them for statis—
tical enrichment of curated gene set from Gene Ontology, KEGG,
REACTOME and Biocarta pathways (Croft et al., 2011; Gene
Ontology Consortium, 2015; Kanehisa et al., 2014; Liberzon et al.,
2011), transcription factor binding motifs from MSigDB (Liberzon
et al., 2011) and gene sets identified by various screening studies
(Brass et al., 2009; de Chassey et al., 2013; Hao et al., 2008; Karlas
et al., 2010; Konig et al., 2010; Shapira et al., 2009; Sui et al., 2009;
Tafforeau et al., 2011; Watanabe et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2009).
Module 5, which exhibited conserved induction in all six virus
strains, was enriched for immune response related processes and
GPCR signaling (Supplementary Table S2). Module 3, exhibiting
mild repression, was associated with several REACTOME pathways
in all but H1N1. Such pathways have been observed to be down
regulated in cellular response to pathogens (e.g. proteasome regula—
tion (Widjaja et al., 2010), destabilization of mRNA (Cathcart and
Semler, 2014); Supplementary Table S2). Similarly, Module 5 of
mouse, which exhibited strong induced expression, is associated
with innate immune response processes such as NFKB signaling and
cytokine signaling (Supplementary Table S3). Furthermore, in both
human and mouse the most induced module was enriched for the
binding sites of IRF7 and ISRE, which are important regulators of

innate immune response genes.

3.5 Gene sets exhibiting pathogenicity specific patterns
We next examined the modules and genes for differential pattern of
expression. We did this in two ways: comparing between pairs of
strains, as well as between groups of strains. For pairs of strains, we
examined the off—diagonal elements in Figure 5 B and observed sev—
eral off—diagonal elements that indicate that a significant number of
genes switch their module assignments between viruses. For ex—
ample, between the low pathogenicity virus H1N1 and the medium
pathogenicity virus PB2—627E, we found transitions between
Module 4 (mild induction) and Module 5 (high induction). Most of
these transitions represented changes in the level of expression but
not in direction. That is, we generally observed changes involving
the mild repression and strong repression modules or mild and
strong induction modules.

One virus participated in several notable transitions:
NS 1trunc124, a medium pathogenicity virus. We observed a signifi—
cant fraction of genes that switched between Module 3 (mild repres—
sion) in both low pathogenicity viruses (H1N1 and NL) to Module
4 of NS1trunc124 (moderate induction). Similarly, we find that
Module 4 of PB2—627E has significant overlap with Module 3 (mod—
erate repression) of NS1trunc124. Overall, we found that
NS1trunc124 had the greatest number of off—diagonal elements.
This is consistent with NS1trunc124’s global expression profile
being the least correlated with any of the other viruses
(Supplementary Fig. S6) as well as the knowledge that the
NSltrunc124 mutation impeded the virus’s ability to modulate host
antiviral response (Tchitchek et al., 2013). Importantly, although
there is little correlation of NS1trunc124’s transcriptional host re—
sponse with the transcriptional response of other viruses, we still

identify conserved components of this virus’s response with other
virus responses.

To systematically identify pathways and genes that are differen—
tially expressed between more than two viruses, we compared mod—
ule assignments for sets of viruses of different pathogenicity levels
using a rule—based pattern extraction approach. Specifically, we rep—
resented each gene’s module assignment across all six viruses as a
string of six numbers, each number denoting a module assignment.
We searched these strings for patterns where genes were in one mod—
ule in one subtree (defined by the virus hierarchy in Fig. 5A), but a
different module in another subtree. For example, the pattern repre—
senting genes in Module 3 (mild repression) in the low pathogenicity
viruses and Module 4 (mild induction) in the high and medium
pathogenicity viruses is 334444. Rule—based pattern extraction to in—
dividual genes identified 871 genes that exhibited a pathogenicity—
specific pattern, representing m12% of the total number of genes
that were analyzed. We focused on patterns that represented transi—
tions between clusters with opposite signs of expression. The pattern
334444 encoding repression (Module 3) in the low pathogenicity
viruses and mild induction (Module 4) in the high and medium
pathogenicity viruses had the largest number of genes (162 genes).
Genes in this pattern were associated with chromatin modification
and RNA splicing machinery. Another interesting signature was
224444, which exhibited a transition between reduced expression in
low pathogenicity viruses to induced expression in high and medium
pathogenicity viruses (Supplementary Dataset S1). The genes having
this pattern were enriched for the REACTOME cell cycle pathway.
A third signature pattern of note was 115555, which indicates re—
pression in the low pathogenicity viruses and induction in all other
viruses (Fig. 6). While as a whole they were not enriched for any spe—
cific pathway, several of these genes were associated with receptor
activity, cell migration and adhesion and immune response processes
(represented by the genes HEY1, EPHB3). These gene sets exhibit
examples of pathogen—specific expression and implicate splicing, cell
cycle and chromatin modification related processes to be differen—
tially regulated between the different pathogenicity groups.

We also applied our rule—based pattern extraction approach to
entire modules by identifying pathways or GO processes associated
with a particular pathogenicity type. We find numerous annotation
categories that were associated with different pathogenicity groups
(Table 1, Supplementary Tables S2 and S3), that are indicative of
host immune response pathways (Type 1 interferon signaling), host
factors that are part of influenza viral replication, as well as immune
response transcription factors. Interestingly, we found that the influ-
enza transcription and replication gene sets were enriched only for
the high pathogenicity viruses in the mildly induced expression mod—
ules. Among the transcription factors whose motifs were enriched in
different modules were important immune response regulators

4 Discussion

With our ever increasing ability to profile transcriptional responses
from multiple diverse biological contexts—different diseases, cell
types, or infections—the need to identify common and context—spe—
cific regulatory network components is becoming increasingly im-
portant. This is especially a challenge in systems biology studies of
infectious disease research where such shared and unique network
components can guide common treatment regimens, as well as iden—
tify host response aspects that are triggered as a function of strain
virulence. To address this challenge, we proposed MULCCH, a
multi—task consensus clustering approach to identify sets of host
genes that are co—expressed in a similar manner under infection with
multiple viruses, as well as to identify genes that exhibit differential
patterns of expression between subsets of virus infections.
Application of our approach to human and mouse transcriptomic
data enabled us to find genes and processes that responded in a
virus— or pathogenicity—specific manner.

Module—based analysis of transcriptional responses is a powerful
approach to identify the major patterns of expression during a dy—
namic process and several approaches have been developed to iden—
tify these modules from one condition (Marzorati et al., 2008).
However, when considering multiple labeled conditions, such as the
different viruses in our problem, methods that can use existing con—
dition labels while finding gene groups within each condition are
needed (Bickel and Scheffer, 2004; Roy et al., 2013). The benefit of
multi—task clustering is that it is more likely to find commonalities in
cases where an independent clustering might not. A global correl-
ation of profiles of human Calu—3 cell response to different influenza
infections showed that one medium pathogenicity virus,
NS1trunc124, was not correlated with the other similarly patho—
genic viruses (Supplementary Fig. S6). However, using our ap—
proach, we were still able to find modules in this virus that
significantly overlapped with modules exhibiting the same pattern
from other viruses. This suggests that there can be subsets of genes

that are correlated despite there being little correlation between gen—
ome—wide profiles.

The ability to reliably detect module transitions for individual
genes is extremely important. Because clustering approaches in gen—
eral are known to be prone to reaching local optima, we used a con—
sensus clustering approach to extract high confidence cluster
assignments and cluster transitions. The choice of the consensus
clustering algorithm was important and influenced the quality of re—
sults. In particular, the spectral method produced better clusters
than the hierarchical method as measured by silhouette index. While
consensus GMM was able to learn stable clusters, it was not able to
identify module transitions reliably, likely because it does not solve
the matching problem across strains, which we had to do as a post
clustering step. Incorporating the pathogenicity relationships using
the hierarchical relatedness approach of the Arboretum framework
was useful to identify genes exhibiting patterns of pathogen specifi-
city. Instead of considering all possible types of transitions, we
applied our rule—based pattern extraction procedure on virus groups
defined by pathogenicity subtrees to identify genes that exhibited
the same module assignment between the same group of pathogen—
icity, but differed in module assignment between pathogenicity
groups. Most genes that exhibit such patterns are similar among the
medium and high pathogenicities.

In this work, we relied on the accuracy of the pathogenicity tree
to relate the viruses. One direction of future research is to explore
simultaneous learning of modules as well as the tree topologies to re—
late the different viruses. An alternate route would be to use multi—
task feature learning approaches (Argyriou et al., 2008), that do not
assume any structure on the tasks and aim to learn most informative
features across all tasks simultaneously. Another promising exten-
sion to the model would be to integrate different types of —omic
measurements (e.g. proteomics, transcriptomics, metabolomics),
with appropriate data specific generative models. In conclusion, our
consensus—based multi—clustering approach is a novel and robust ap—
proach to identify common and context—specific sets of co—expressed
genes that can be applied to large numbers of related viruses. As sys—
tems biology studies expand to additional viruses, approaches such
as ours will be increasingly useful for guiding targeted therapeutics.

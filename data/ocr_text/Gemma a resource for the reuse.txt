ABSTRACT

Summary: Gemma is a database, analysis software system and web
site for genomics data re-use and meta-analysis. Currently, Gemma
contains analyzed data from over 3300 expression profiling studies,
yielding hundreds of millions of differential expression results and
coexpression patterns (correlated expression) for retrieval and visual-
ization. With optional registration users can save their own data and
securely share it with other users. Web services and integration with
third-party resources further increase the scope of the tools, which
include a Cytoscape plugin.

1 SCOPE AND DATA SOURCES

The goal of Gemma is to enable the rapid exploration and ana-
lysis of large quantities of genomics data, leveraging the extensive
data available from other public bioinformatics resources such as
the Gene Expression Omnibus (Barrett et al., 2007).

Currently, Gemma contains nearly 4000 expression profiling
studies (‘datasets’; in total over 170 000 assays, from eight taxa).
Multiple technology types are supported, such as array-based
platforms and RNA sequencing. To enable comparisons across
platforms, we perform sequence analysis and gene assignment
based on the current genome annotations (Barnes et al., 2005).
Each public dataset undergoes automated (French et al., 2009)
and manual annotation using controlled vocabularies such as the
Disease Ontology (Schriml et al., 2012), adding information
about the experimental design to allow group comparisons.
Additional quality control steps to detect outlier samples or data-
sets with large batch effects are also performed.

Each dataset is then analyzed for differential expression
(e. g. between conditions or tissues) and coexpression (correlation
of expression levels across samples). Differential expression is

computed using a standard multivariate linear modeling
approach (Pavlidis and Noble, 2001) comparing each condition
in a dataset with baseline, accommodating complex factorial de-
signs and continuous covariates. Coexpression is computed for
each dataset and stored as a set of “coexpression links’ that meet
stringent statistical criteria (Lee et al., 2004). The results of these
analysis are stored in the system for user search and retrieval.

2 FUNCTIONALITY

A main entry point for Gemma is a form that allows users to
search for differential expression or coexpression results. The
search facilities enable analysis of selected genes [by symbols,
key words or Gene Ontology terms (Ashbumer et al., 2000)]
and experiments (based on free text or our annotations of dis-
ease, treatment, tissue, etc.). Users can ﬂexibly organize genes or
datasets into groups. With optional registration, these groups
persist across sessions and can be securely shared with other
users.

Differential expression results are presented in a matrix visu-
alization displaying the genes in rows and individual conditions
across studies in columns (Fig. 1). For each gene, a ‘meta-
P—value’ is provided. For each condition’s differentially ex-
pressed genes, Gemma provides information on the enrichment
of the user’s selected genes in that pattern. The data view can be
filtered, sorted and exported as an image. Visualizations of the
underlying expression patterns are also readily obtained (Fig. 1).

For coexpression searches, Gemma applies a user-settable
threshold for how many datasets a link must be observed in
before it is displayed. Coexpression results are shown in a tabular
format and as an interactive network view (Fig. l) (Lopes et al.,
2010). Gemma uses the concept of node degree (how many links
a gene has; i.e. ‘hubbiness’) to assist the user in gauging the im-
portance of an observation (Gillis and Pavlidis, 2011). This is
important because in a query-driven network view, only a tiny
subset of the network is displayed. For each gene, Gemma esti-
mates the overall node degree and indicates low-node degree
genes in darker shades (Fig. l).

Gemma offers many other features for exploration and ana-
lysis. For each gene, an overview page shows the datasets in
which the gene is differentially expressed, genes with which the

gene is reproducibly coexpressed and expression platforms on
which the gene is represented (e.g. http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/
Gemma/g/?id=l4676). Similarly, for each dataset, Gemma pro-
vides annotations, summaries of the analyses and visualizations
(e. g. http://www.chibi.ubc.ca/Gemma/ee/?id=1570). Registered
users can also upload their own expression datasets to be
included for meta-analysis and are provided with an extensive
suite of administration tools for data management.

Gemma was designed with data reuse and extensibility in
mind. Results can be downloaded in tab-delimited formats for
external analysis, and web services are available to access
Gemma programmatically. As an example of such integration
and to allow more advanced visualization and analysis of coex-
pression data from Gemma, we have developed ‘GemScape,’ a
plugin for the popular network analysis tool Cytoscape (Kohl
et al., 2011). Data from Gemma are also currently available
through the Neuroscience Information Framework (Gupta
et al., 2008) (differential expression results) and inSilicon
(Taminau et al., 2011) (experimental design annotations).

Tutorials, in-line help and a wiki with additional user manuals
and system information are available through the Gemma web
site.

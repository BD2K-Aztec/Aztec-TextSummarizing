ABSTRACT

Motivation: Cell migration is a complex process that is controlled
through the time-sequential feedback regulation of protein signalling
and gene regulation. Based on prior knowledge and own
experimental data, we developed a large-scale dynamic network
describing the onset and maintenance of hepatocyte growth factor-
induced migration of primary human keratinocytes. We applied
Boolean logic to capture the qualitative behaviour as well as short-
and long-term dynamics of the complex signalling network involved
in this process, comprising protein signalling, gene regulation and
autocrine feedback.

Results: A Boolean model has been compiled from time-resolved
transcriptome data and literature mining, incorporating the main
pathways involved in migration from initial stimulation to phenotype
progress. Steady-state analysis under different inhibition and
stimulation conditions of known key molecules reproduces existing
data and predicts novel interactions based on our own experiments.
Model simulations highlight for the first time the necessity of a
temporal sequence of initial, transient MET receptor (met proto-
oncogene, hepatocyte growth factor receptor) and subsequent,
continuous epidermal growth factor/integrin signalling to trigger and
sustain migration by autocrine signalling that is integrated through
the Focal adhesion kinase protein. We predicted in silica and verified
in Vitro that long-term cell migration is stopped if any of the two
feedback loops are inhibited.

1 INTRODUCTION

Cell migration and wound healing are complex cellular
processes that involve keratinocytes, ﬁbroblasts, blood vessels and
inﬂammatory cells (Xue et al., 2007). Keratinocyte migration
plays an important role in re—epithelialization and wound healing
(Hunt et al., 2000), which is a multistep cellular process by the

coordination of extra— and intracellular signals (Muyderman et al.,
2001; Werner et al., 2007). The precise regulation of cell migration
in its temporal sequence, activation and de—activation is crucial for
tissue homeostasis. In its aberrant form, it can lead to scar formation
(Heng, 2011) and has critical implications to cancer metastasis
formation (Schafer and Werner, 2008).

Different growth factors such as hepatocyte growth factor (HGF),
epidermal growth factor (EGF), transforming growth factor—beta
(TGF—ﬂ), keratinocyte growth factor (KGF) and ﬁbroblast growth
factor (EGF) that activate and regulate cell migration have been
extensively studied in many cell types (Birchmeier et al., 2003;
Hudson and McCawley, 1998; J aakkola et al., 1998; Pastore et al.,
2008; Tsuboi et al., 1993). These growth factors have been found to
overlap with mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways
(Cho and Klemke, 2000; Kain and Klemke, 2001; Klemke et al.,
1997).

HGF interacts and activates MET receptor (Bottaro et al.,
1991) to induce context—dependent several cellular processes such
as proliferation, cell movement or morphogenic differentiation
(Brinkmann et al., 1995; Clague, 2011; Jeffers et al., 1996; Medico
et al., 1996). Herein, we focus on HGF—induced migration of primary
normal human keratinocytes (NHK).

Although there is vast literature concerning HGF—induced
keratinocyte migration and MET receptor dynamics, the dynamic
interplay of initial MET receptor regulation and subsequent
autocrine regulation that initiate, sustain and control cell migration
remain poorly understood. Based on time—resolved transcriptome
data of NHK after HGF stimulation, we have previously inferred a
gene regulatory model describing the decision process of NHK cells
towards migration (Busch et al., 2008). From the model analysis it
was evident that several pathways coordinate their action to initiate
and sustain cell migration upon initial HGF stimulation: migration is
started through the AP—l system and maintained after MET receptor
internalization (Clague, 2011) by autocrine signalling through EGF
receptor (EGFR) and urokinase plasminogen activator surface
receptor (uPAR) (Schnickmann et al., 2009). The model predicted
qualitatively how the temporal sequence of transient MET receptor
activation and subsequent long—term EGF receptor activity sustained
the migratory phenotype. However, as the model was based on
transcriptome data alone, there was no mechanistic explanation
of the observed processes. A model combining transcriptome data
with mechanistic protein signalling has been missing so far. A
major obstacle in building such a model lies in the different time
scales involved in the process of cell migration. In general, the
transcriptome response changes over several hours, while protein
signalling pathways become active within minutes upon receptor

Cell Migration

Fig. 1. Boolean network model of the HGF—induced keratinocyte migration. Nodes are connected by directed edges, where black and red connections denote
activating and inhibitory interactions, respectively. Red nodes represent transcriptionally regulated proteins, yellow nodes are endpoints of the network. ‘AND’
‘gates are denoted by blue dots and ‘OR’ gates are found where more than one edge connects to single node. Dashed edges denote interactions that have not
been considered, when calculating the steady state and are shown for completeness

stimulation (Mesecke et al., 2011). Capturing all necessary and
sufﬁcient events on the protein signalling level, including kinetic
parameters, is close to impossible by current biological technology.

To link our prior transcriptome—based model with protein
signalling pathways, we present a Boolean network model of HGF—
induced keratinocyte migration. The Boolean approach allows to
derive important functional properties and predictions without the
need for detailed quantitative kinetic data and parameters. In the
past, the approach has been successfully applied for diverse systems
such as gene regulatory networks (Albert and Othmer, 2003; Chaves
et al., 2005), models of ﬂoral morphogenesis (Mendoza et al., 1999),
mammalian cell cycle (Mendoza, 2006), EGFR signalling (Samaga
et al., 2009) or apoptosis (Schlatter et al., 2009).

To our knowledge, this is the ﬁrst model for HGF—induced
keratinocyte migration that incorporates protein signalling, gene
regulation and autocrine feedback, following cellular dynamics
from initial stimulation to the execution of the phenotype. To
obtain the dynamical behaviour reproducing literature knowledge
and our own experimental data, we include several time scales in
the model mimicking the fast activation of downstream signalling
of MET, MAPK/ERK and p38/JNK pathways, as well as the
slow transcriptome response and subsequent autocrine activation
of EGFR and uPA receptors, all of which are necessary to sustain
cell migration after MET receptor internalization. Speciﬁcally, from
a logical steady—state analysis, we show that priming of the HGF—
MET receptor system is necessary for continued autocrine regulation

Boolean modelling of keratinocyte migration

 

through EGFR and integrins, sustaining the MAPK/ERK activity.
More importantly, we predicted and showed experimentally, that the
inhibition of the plasminogen activator inhibitor—1 (PAL 1), or serpin
E1, a serine protease inhibitor, stops cell migration only beyond 1 h
of stimulation, when autocrine signalling loops through uPA/uPAR
become important and after the ﬁrst wave of protein signalling and
transcriptional response.

2 METHODS

2.1 Reconstruction of the NHK migration model

A Boolean network, comprising protein signalling pathway, gene expression
dynamics and autocrine feedback was constructed based on our previous
gene regulatory model for keratinocyte migration (Busch et al., 2008).
There, time—resolved gene expression data of NHK were recorded at t:
[0h,lh,2h,3h,4h,6h,8h] after stimulation with HGF (ArrayExpress ID:
E—TABM—440). As a basis for our HGF—induced cell migration network,
we chose genes that have either a large differential response after HGF
stimulation or genes that are known to be functionally related to cell
migration. Genes ﬁnally included in the model are depicted in Figure
2A. To link immediate early and late responding genes to initial MET
receptor signalling and subsequent protein pathways, respectively, we
integrated differentially expressed genes with signalling pathways known
from literature. Additional pathways for the HGF migration network
were identiﬁed through the commercial IPA (Ingenuity Systems; www.
ingenuity. com) software. A dataset containing gene identiﬁers and
corresponding expression values was uploaded into the application. Each
gene kinetic was mapped to its corresponding object in the Ingenuity
Knowledge Base. The above identiﬁed molecules were overlaid onto a global
molecular network developed from information contained in the application.
This generated a score with meaningful and signiﬁcant networks, biological
functions and the canonical pathways based on the Fisher exact test.

2.2 The NHK migration model as a dynamic
Boolean model

We used a Boolean model framework to construct a dynamic, temporally
discrete model for NHK migration. Each node y can take the values 0 or 1,
representing either the present/absent or inactive/active, i.e. phosphorylated,
state of the protein or gene. The network state is represented by the vector
with the set of Boolean variables Y ={y1,y2,...,yn}, where y,- denotes the
state of the ith node. The state of activation of each node changes according
to the transition function F ={fl,f2, ...,f,,}. The next state of the network
Y (t+ 1) changes in discrete time steps according to yi(t+ 1) =f,-{x(t)}.

We simulated the Boolean network under synchronous update using the R
BoolNet library (Miissel et al., 2010). As we consider both protein signalling
and gene regulation, two time scales were included in the model. Rapid
protein modiﬁcations such as phosphorylation can thereby be separated from
long—term effects, transcriptional changes, protein synthesis and autocrine
signalling. Time—scale separation was done by ﬁrst introducing a reference
time through the transcriptome kinetics and equating the time of maximal fold
change of the respective genes with their switching—on time. Consequently,
our model contains two time scales: 0—1 and 1—3h (marked as 1 and 3,
respectively), denoting the time intervals after HGF stimulation, during
which the reactions can be switched on the earliest. These represent the
early HGF downstream signalling and ﬁrst transcriptional response as well
as the autocrine feedback, which are both necessary to trigger and sustain
cell migration.

The reference publications from which the interactions have been inferred
as well as their Boolean transition functions and time windows are listed in
the Supplementary Table S1.

2.3 Cell culture

Normal human skin keratinocytes (NHK) were derived from foreskin
epidermis and cultivated in keratinocyte serum free medium (KSFM;
Invitrogen, Carlsbad, CA, USA) as previously described (Busch et al., 2008).
Cells were kept under a humidiﬁed environment with 5% C02 and 37°C.
NHK up to Passages 4—5 were used in all experiments of this study. Cells
were treated as described bellow and collected after 1, 2, 3, 4, 6 and 8h
treatment for expression proﬁling.

2.4 Scratch assay

Monolayer scratch assays were used to evaluate migration of NHK
as described before (Busch et al., 2008). Brieﬂy, cells were grown
to conﬂuence in ibidi u—dish containing culture inserts (ibidi, Munich,
Germany) and treated with mitomycin c 10 ug/mL (Sigma—Aldrich, St.
Louis, MO, USA) for 3h before stimulation. Cells were stimulated with
10 ng/mL HGF (Sigma—Aldrich) and/or 25 MM Tiplaxtinin, a PAI—l inhibitor
(Axon Medchem, Groningen, Netherlands). Time—lapse microscopy of cell
migration was recorded using the Perfect Focus Systems , every 30 min up to
24 h, on a Nikon Eclipse Ti microscope with a Digital Sight DS—QiMc (Nikon
Instruments Inc., Tokyo, Japan), coupled to an ibidi—heating chamber.

2.5 Cell migration assay

Keratinocyte migration was analysed with an independent second technique,
so—called xCELLigence Real—Time Cell Analyzer DP (Roche Diagnostics).
The speciﬁc migration CIM—plates were ﬁlled with medium and the
respective stimulus/inhibitor as described above. NHK were seeded (6 x 104
cells/well) into the top chamber wells of the CIM—plate according to the
manufacturer instructions. Cell migration was monitored every 15 min for
up to 24h by changes of the impedance signal of the cells that crossed the
membrane from the top to the bottom chamber. For analysis of migration, the
area under the curve was measured for the ﬁrst 8 h. The data were expressed
as the mean :I: SD of quadruplicates in three independent experiments.
Differences were assessed by the Student t—test for unpaired samples and
a P—value < 0.05 was considered to be signiﬁcant.

2.6 Western blot

NHK were lysed in RIPA buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail
(Roche), and later diluted in Laemmli buffer. Proteins were electrophoresed
on 12.5% sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS)—polyacrylamide gels, transferred
to polyvinylidene diﬂuoride membranes, and immunoblotted with antibodies
to total p44/42 MAPK (ERK1/2) (Cell Signalling #9102), phospho p44/42
MAPK (pERK1/2) (Cell Signalling #9101), total FAK (Cell Signalling
#3285), phospho—FAK (Tyr925) (Cell Signalling #3284) overnight at
4°C. Membranes were visualized with chemiluminescence after using

software. Values obtained for both p44 and p42 ERK bands were added
together and phospho p44/42 values were normalized to total p44/42. Values
of phospho—FAK (Tyr925) were normalized to total FAK.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

Upon stimulation with HGF keratinocytes start to migrate
collectively. Several points of interference that modulate
keratinocyte migration have been previously identiﬁed. However,
time sequential orchestration of the whole—cell signalling remains
unclear so far. Our goal is to understand how downstream signalling
of the HGF—activated MET receptor is translated into a sustained
migratory behaviour. To accomplish this, we developed a Boolean
network model of the combined MAPK signalling pathways, gene
regulation and autocrine feedback, which links known interactions
of downstream protein and gene targets of MET with subsequent
changes in the cellular homeostasis.

3.1 Boolean network model properties

The keratinocyte migration model is a logical interaction hypergraph
connected by logic gates. It comprises 66 nodes, excluding the drain
nodes and 66 interactions (Fig. 1), integrating the main pathways and
genes known to be involved in HGF—induced keratinocyte migration.
For detailed information about the biological processes and context
from which the model was derived, please confer to Supplementary
Table S 1.

There are two input nodes, the MET receptor, stimulated through
HGF, as well as EGFR, stimulated by HBEGF. Both receptors

have been shown to be involved in keratinocyte migration in a
time—sequential manner (Busch et al., 2008). Four further nodes
are included to applying external interventions: PAI—l, AKAP12,
DUSPl and PTEN. AKAP12 and DUSPl are not included in
the calculation of the steady—state below. Despite the fact that
they are found to be up—regulated on the transcriptome level, the
respective proteins seem to exert a stabilizing negative feedback
function (Legewie et al., 2008), not completely inhibiting their
speciﬁc targets, but allowing for a rapid protein induction (Bluthgen,
2010). In line with this, we ﬁnd akap12 strongly up—regulated
in HGF—induced keratinocyte migration (Fig. 2A), although over—
expression of akap12 has been associated with reduced motility
(Gelman, 2010). A Boolean representation of such negative feedback
behaviour is not straight forward and will often lead to — a
biologically questionable — oscillatory steady state. Hence, we
included the proteins for completeness, yet excluded it from steady—
state analysis.

3.2 Dynamics of the Boolean network model for
migration

To search for steady—state attractors of the Boolean network model,
we randomly initialized all network nodes, except for HGF/PAI—l
and AKAP12/PTEN with either 0 or 1 and performed synchronous
state transitions until a simple attractor was reached. Activating the
nodes HGF and PAI—l to 1 mimicked HGF stimulation and allowed
for autocrine feedback through uPAR signalling. Setting AKAP12
and PTEN to zero excluded their inhibitory effects. Sampling
over 11:107 random initialization of the network we ﬁnd only
one attractor of the network with the node CELL MIGRATION
switched on. Although only a minor fraction of all possible

network initializations (n = 262) has been sampled, this result is still
suggestive of a robust response irrespective of the initial network
state, i.e. cell migration follows upon MET receptor activation and
subsequent autocrine signalling.

In detail node and pathway activity moves along the following
steps after transient MET receptor signalling: (i) the ﬁrst and
necessary input into the network towards migration is the
stimulation with HGF, which immediately and speciﬁcally activates
the MET receptor. Within the ﬁrst hour, the signal activates
three different downstream pathways, PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK
and PI3K (grey boxes, Fig. 1); (ii) ERK phosphorylation
activates transcriptional responses, leading to the down-regulation
of proliferation and activates, together with p38/JNK, essential
cytokines and transcription factors for migration within the ﬁrst
hour, such as HBEGF, IL8 and ATF2, as well as cJUN and
cFOS, respectively. HBEGF has been shown to mediate the

subsequent autocrine activation of EGFR (Busch et al., 2008); (iii)
The activation of cJUN and cFOS nodes leads to an initiation
of the AP-l system, which in turn stimulates the uPA/uPAR
signalling pathway by activation of the uPAR, triggering the
formation from plasminogen activator to plasmin. According to
the transcriptome kinetics, the uPA/uPAR pathway becomes active
2h after HGF stimulation, being controlled by PAI—l. Plasmin
is a major factor for induction of metalloproteinases 1 and 10
(MMP1/MMP10), linking degradation of the extracellular matrix
(ECM) with integrin signalling; (iv) The integrins transmit the
extracellular signalling back into the cell through the focal adhesion
kinase (FAK). Together with activated EGFR this protein sustains
PLC/PKC, MAPK and PI3K activity similar to the initial HGF/MET
activation. It is known that the MET receptor undergoes rapid
internalization, possibly switching off its signalling in favour of
EGFR activity. In fact, we have shown previously that HGF/MET

activity is not required for keratinocyte migration beyond 1.5 h after
stimulation (Busch et al., 2008). Accordingly, the model suggests
that continued PI3K up—regulation can only occur through the
combined activity of integrin and EGFR signalling in the presence
of FAK. Signalling continues through AKT, DOCKl and RAS to
sustain RACl/CDC42 activity, which result in the downstream
activity of p21 protein (CDC42/RAC)—activated kinases (PAKs),
mitogen—activated kinase kinases (MKK) and ﬁnally activation of
JNK/p38. This closes the autocrine loop through time sequentially
activated external receptors. This late response of the keratinocyte
migration network through activation of uPAR, integrins and EGFR
triggers similar pathways as the MET signalling, but furthermore
results in the prolonged activation of PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK, PI3K,
RACl/CDC42 and JNK/p38 pathways to sustain the long—term
migration response.

Figure 2B shows a simulation of the network dynamics after
HGF stimulation up to 3 h, as marked by the white vertical
gaps, having initialized all network nodes, except for HGF with
0 for clarity. The transitions towards the ﬁnal steady states are
indicated in arbitrary time units. Clearly, an activation wave of
the three downstream pathways PLC/PKC, MAPK/ERK and PI3K
is evident, resulting in the up—regulation of the respective target
genes (Fig. 2A), the AP—l system and starting cell migration within
1h. In the following 2h, autocrine signalling loops activate EGFR
and integrin signalling through HBEGF and uPAR, respectively.
Switching off the MET receptor has no inﬂuence on the steady
state at this time, and cell migration continues. Switching off
either uPA/uPAR signalling through PAI—l or inhibiting EGFR stops
migration through subsequent switching off all pathways.

Table 1 lists the steady states of the Boolean network under
different input settings and/or different scenarios. Interestingly, the
model predicts that cells will migrate only when HGF signalling
primes the cells, followed by EGFR and integrin signalling. This is
in line with our previous ﬁndings, which now can be explained on
the causal level of protein signalling.

Lastly, we note that our model still has limitations predicting
the correct long—term behaviour for transiently activated genes such
as egr], il8, ctgf or 66120. Although the model captures the long—
term cell migration response and upstream pathway activity, it does
not yet include a negative feedback down—regulating of these genes
(compare Fig. 2A and B). Although the biological consequences of
the transient gene activation remain unclear so far, this divergence
between the model steady—state behaviour and experimental data
beyond 3 h need to be addressed in more detail in the future.

Model simulation clearly reﬂects the necessity for the time
sequential pathway activation, shown by the early and late
steady state after 1 and 3 h, respectively. Initial HGF/MET
receptor signalling triggers, while subsequent integrin/EGF receptor
signalling sustains MAPK/ERK, PI3K, PLC/PKC and JNK/p38
signalling (Fig. 3C). Model simulations further predict that
continued migration depends on both EGFR and integrin signalling.
Failure of either one causes the down—regulation of the FAK protein
and subsequent PI3K, MAPK/ERK and p38/JNK pathways (Fig.
2, Columns d and e). Indeed, we have previously shown the
dependency of cell migration on sustained EGFR activity after MET
signalling pathway activation (Busch et al., 2008).

To experimentally validate the long—term dependency of NHK
on the FAK protein—mediated integrin signalling, we interrupt the
uPA/uPAR signalling pathway through inhibition of PAI—l. In line

with previous ﬁndings (Providence and Higgins, 2004) and predicted
from our network simulation, long—term, but not immediate cell
migration should be decreased. A scratch assay (Fig. 3A) shows
a signiﬁcant decrease with the usage of the PAI—l inhibitor
(Tiplaxtinin) in migration when compared with control conditions.
While under HGF stimulation, the scratch is almost closed after
8h, hardly any cell movement is detected under additional PAI—l
inhibitor treatment. The delayed impact of PAI—l inhibition becomes
evident from a real—time analysis of keratinocyte migration using the
xCELLigence Cell Analyzer (Fig. 3B). Clearly, the migration speed
becomes strongly reduced after 2.5 h, in line with the suggested
role for ‘late’ uPA/uPAR signalling pathway involvement, activating
FAK through integrin/EGFR signalling for sustained migration. This
time point also coincides with the start of transcriptional activation of
PAI—l (Fig. 2A), furthermore supporting the late involvement of this
pathway. Interestingly, MET receptor and integrin/FAK pathways
both activate MAPK/ERK, PI3K and PLC/PKC, RACl/CDC42
and JNK/p38. However, while the former primes the cells towards
migration, the impact of the latter on downstream pathways seems
to be much more pronounced. Analysing the phosphorylation state
of ERK (pERK) we observe an immediate and sustained increase of
pERK under HGF treatment in line with our simulation. Differences
in pERK level under simultaneous PAI—l inhibition become most
apparent at late time points beyond 2h, conﬁrming the model
predictions of late impact of integrin signalling on ERK. Looking
at FAK as an up—stream effector of ERK (Sawhney et al., 2006),
we ﬁnd similar activity for pFAK under HGF stimulation and
PAI—l inhibition. We observe a strong, but late increase in FAK
activity as determined from phosphorylation of the Y925 site of
FAK (pFAK (Y925)). Simultaneous stimulation of HGF and PAI—l
inhibition decreases pFAK (Y925) when compared with HGF alone
(Supplementary Fig. S1). Immediate increase of pFAK (Y925)
suggests a possible role of FAK in the beginning of migration.
Previous work has shown two distinct phases in FAK involvement
for wound healing in rat keratinocytes (Providence and Higgins,
2004). There, the effect of PAI—l inhibition became evident only
after 6 h and more into migration. Herein, we can possibly explain
the importance of FAK for prolonged migration through the time
sequential regulation of uPA/uPAR, integrin and EGFR signalling
pathways, which were predicted from network simulation and have
been — in part — experimentally validated. Further studies for
a better understanding of this complex pathway orchestration of
HGF—induced migration will be necessary, of course.

4 CONCLUSIONS

We have shown for the ﬁrst time a comprehensive model for
HGF—induced keratinocyte migration. The model comprises two
time scales and incorporates various signalling pathway critically
involved in the initiation, sustaining and controlling of keratinocyte
migration. Being mostly compiled from prior knowledge and vast
literature, it will lend itself to rapid hypothesis testing of key points
of interference.

We are aware that the above model cannot capture the entire
complexity of this process. Most of the simulation results are
suggestive about the underlying process and further experiments
will need to be conducted to study the complex orchestration of
pathways leading to keratinocyte migration. However, our model
makes several important and experimentally testable predictions

Boolean modelling of keratinocyte migration

 

about putative targets and time of intervention to control this process.
It underscores the temporal sequence of events from initial trigger
to execution, allowing for a fail—safe mechanism of migration under
wild—type and inhibition conditions. It is in line with previous
ﬁndings from literature and captures the short— and long—term
feedback regulation of protein signalling and gene expression. In
particular, the order of events becomes evident, how MET receptor
activity primes the cell for sub sequent EGFR and integrin signalling,
leading sustained migration. Exchanging the order of stimulation
(ﬁrst EGFR followed by MET receptor activation), keratinocytes
will not migrate, which is explained in the model and supported
by our ﬁrst experimental results from the altered role of the FAK
proteins at late time points. Indeed, MET receptor deregulation is
a hallmark for cancer metastasis (Gherardi et al, 2012). If MET
is constitutively activated, it would need only additional EGFR
activity to induce cellular spread, according to the network model.
Apparently, this by—passes the fail—safe mechanism for cells to
migrate only within the correct context. A synergistic action of EGFR
and MET have been found before (Brusevold et al, 2012; Zhou
et al, 2007), yet the causal relationship between them remained
unclear so far.

Beyond further experimental validation, the need for model
extensions to multiple logical states or even continuous
representation of the variables using ordinary differential equation
approach is evident. Our current approach cannot account for
the multiple negative feedback regulations of either AKAP12 or
DUSPl. Such negative feedback seems to be a recurrent regulatory
motif (Becskei and Serrano, 2000; Bluthgen, 2010), and it should
be interesting to study its biological implications.

Taken together, the Boolean model approach lends itself to a better
mechanistic understanding of the process of keratinocyte migration,
wound healing, cancer metastasis and/or impaired wound healing
from stimulation to phenotype development and will help in the
prediction of cellular control targets in wild type and disease.

ABSTRACT

Summary: CytoModeler is an open-source Java application based
on the Cytoscape platform. It integrates large-scale network
analysis and quantitative modeling by combining omics analysis
on the Cytoscape platform, access to deterministic and stochastic
simulators, and static and dynamic network context visualizations of
simulation results.

Availability: Implemented in Java, CytoModeler runs with
Cytoscape 2.6 and 2.7. Binaries, documentation and video
walkthroughs are freely available at http://vrac.iastate.edu/~jlv/
cytomodeler/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Large—scale network analysis and quantitative modeling have
emerged as key methods for interpreting biological datasets. Large—
scale network analysis uses networks to model large—scale omics
data produced by high—throughput screening, where nodes represent
biological species and edges between nodes stand for interactions
between the species. Quantitative mathematical modeling of
biological systems has a much longer history than large—scale
network analysis. In this method, researchers build mathematical
equations for biological systems and simulate, predict and test
behaviors of the systems in silico.

Signiﬁcant progress has been made in the development of
software that focuses on large—scale network and quantitative
modeling over the past 10 years such as Cytoscape (Shannon et al.,
2003), a popular open—source software platform for large—scale
network visualization and for viewing and editing data, along with a
highly ﬂexible and extensible plug—in mechanism, Systems Biology
Toolbox (SBT; Schmidt and Jirstrand, 2006) and Systems Biology
Workbench (SBW; Sauro et al., 2003) for quantitative modeling.

While the number of active software tools which implement these
two types of methods singly is growing fast, linkages between them
are missing. Knowledge inferred from large—scale network analysis
can be quantitatively modeled for examining the dynamics of smaller
subsystems with respect to various physiological conditions or time

courses. CytoModeler is a software tool dedicated to bridging large—
scale network analysis and quantitative modeling by providing the
following features: (i) access to a wide range of functionality for
large—scale network analysis by being a plug—in tool on Cytoscape
platform, (ii) a built—in compact quantitative model editor which
enables model creating, importing and exporting with several
formats including SBML levels 1 and 2, (iii) a model exchanger
which allows users to transfer modeling information between
Cytoscape and quantitative modeling tools such as the SBT on
MATLAB and SBW and (iv) advanced visualization for quantitative
simulation results in a network context. This functionality enables
biologists to integrate large—scale network analysis and quantitative
modeling into an analytical workﬂow of systems biology.

2 FUNCTIONALITY AND IMPLEMENTATION

The architecture of CytoModeler is categorized into three functional
components. The ﬁrst component, the CytoModeler Model Editor,
is a built—in equation editor. It offers concise model editing
function by using CyNodes, CyNetworks and HyperEdges (CyNode,
CyNetwork: basic elements in Cytoscape to represent node and
biological network; HyperEdge, a special type of edge which is
able to represent biochemical reaction.) of the Cytoscape platform.
It also provides a model transformer which enables communication
with other Cytoscape function plug—ins. Furthermore, it allows users
to import and export the edited model into several formats such
as SBML. The second component, the CytoModeler Simulation
Interface gives users multiple choices for simulating the model.
It is based on an improved version of ISBJava (Ramsey et al.,
2005), including new simulator interface, enhanced visualization for
simulation results and support for exporting and importing SBML
level 2 version 1 ﬁle. This simulator offers many numerical solvers
including deterministic and stochastic algorithms. If a user needs
more sophisticated systems analysis such as bifurcation analysis, the
CytoModeler Simulation Interface can connect with the modeling
information with other dedicated analytical tools such as SBT
on MATLAB, SBW and COPASI to facilitate the further system
analysis using Java interface and SBML standard ﬁle format. The
extensible architecture allows it to be integrated with other third
party systems biology tools. The third component, CytoModeler
Visualizer, provides advanced visualization for simulation results.
The visualization modes include both static and dynamic points of
view. In static visualization mode, the user can individually plot X—Y
charts showing simulation result of each species in its corresponding
CyNode view or plot the X — Y chart in the Cytoscape data panel.
When the user clicks any of the time series for a biochemical species

3 USAGE EXAMPLE

Figure 1 shows how to perform the integrated analysis (from omics
analysis to dynamics modeling) to a speciﬁc functional module of
the network by using Cytoscape functional plug-in OmicsAnalyzer
(Xia et al., 2010), SubgraphCreator and CytoModeler. As a proof
of concept, we focused on a network motif Sec9-Sncl/2-Sso2 of
the vesicular transport community of the Yeast galactose utilization
(GAL) network (Ideker et al., 2001) (given in the Cytoscape sample
data folder as ‘ galFilteredgml’) because the motif actually identiﬁes
protein interactions between SNARE (soluble N -ethylmaleimide-
sensitive factor attachment protein receptor) proteins which are
crucial players in vesicle transportation and exocytosis (Jahn and
Scheller, 2006). First, by using SubgraphCreator, another Cytoscape
plug-in developed by our group, we created a subnetwork for the
vesicular transport community from the GAL network in Cytoscape.
Secondly, OmicsAnalyzer was used to map omics data (given in the
Cytoscape sample data folder as ‘galExpData.pvals’ ﬁle format) to

the Sec9-Sncl/2-Sso2 network motif of the community network.
Then, OmicsAnalyzer Visualizes the imported data in a network
context and examines the statistical correlation of the SNARE gene
expressions. Finally, we connected omics analysis with dynamical
modeling of the Sec9-Snc2-Sso2 motif using CytoModeler. We
transformed the motif to a CytoModeler network by clicking ‘Create
Model from Current Network’ button and adding the reaction
equations through the reaction palette in the CytoModeler Model
Editor. After adding in sample protein and reaction constant with
parameters, we built a simulation-ready model for the network.
Using the CytoModeler simulation interface with the built—in ODE
solver, a ﬁfth-order adaptive Runge-Kutta method, the in silico
experiments successfully produced the previous observations (Scott
et al., 2004), which shows how different initial concentrations of
these SNARE proteins have large effects on the progression of
membrane fusion.

The supplementary data provides the models for the example
given in Figure 1.

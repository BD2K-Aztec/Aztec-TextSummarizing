ABSTRACT

Summary: Characterizing genetic diversity through genotyping
short amplicons is central to evolutionary biology. Next-generation
sequencing (NGS) technologies changed the scale at which these
type of data are acquired. SESAME is a web application package
that assists genotyping of multiplexed individuals for several markers
based on NGS amplicon sequencing. It automatically assigns reads
to loci and individuals, corrects reads if standard samples are
available and provides an intuitive graphical user interface (GUI) for
allele validation based on the sequences and associated decision-
making tools. The aim of SESAME is to help allele identification
among a large number of sequences.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since the breakthrough of PCR in the 1980s, researchers have been
using various DNA markers and approaches to characterize the
genetic diversity such as microsatellites, single strand conformation
polymorphism (S SCP) and ampliﬁed fragment length polymorphism
(AFLP). However, direct sequencing of DNA loci from a large
number of individuals was costly and labor intensive. This was even
further an issue for nuclear markers where cloning must precede
Sanger sequencing to disentangle alleles. Technical advances
involved in next—generation sequencing (NGS) technologies,
including clonal ampliﬁcation (454®, Roche) or single molecule
sequencing (SMRT®, Paciﬁc Bioscience), open new horizons where
gigabases of DNA sequences can be obtained easily. One can take
advantage from these innovations to directly and massively sequence

amplicons. However, this approach necessitates tagging individual
amplicons and sorting out real alleles from reads with sequencing
errors.

We have created SESAME as a user—friendly web application
package for analyzing amplicon sequences obtained through NGS,
where the amplicon is completely covered by a read. It includes
automatic sequence assignation to multiple markers and individuals
via oligonucleotide tags. It provides an intuitive point—and—click
interface to validate sequences as allele from individual—based
variant alignments. The results are exported as genotypes or
sequences of alleles. To our knowledge, no similar software has
been published that accomplishes all these tasks.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

SESAME is a database oriented web application with an easy to
use graphical user interface (GUI). The database can be accessed
simultaneously by several users sharing their data within a project.
An assistant guides the user for input data upload and through the
sequence analysis steps (Supplementary Materials). All data are
stored in a relational database. The user interacts with the database
through an intuitive interface during the allele validation procedure.

2.1 Input data and automatic sequence analysis

Amplicons are individually identiﬁed by oligonucleotide tags linked
as described in Galan et al. (2010). Although only one tag is strictly
needed for assignation, using both forward and reverse tags increases
the number of possible combinations. Furthermore, SESAME allows
simultaneous analysis of several loci multiplexed in a single run.
Sample (individual—locus combination) information is read from
a comma—separated values (CSVs) ﬁle providing sample name,
marker name, expected ploidy level, primer and tag sequences,
status (sample or standard), population name and species (step 1).
DNA sequences are read from one single FASTA ﬁle (step 2).
Furthermore, users are asked to provide the list of DNA markers with
corresponding reference sequences that will be used for assignation
of the reads to loci and for trimming them from primers and tags.
More precisely, DNA sequences are BLASTed (with user—deﬁned
E—value) against the reference sequences to assign each read to
a locus and determine read orientation (step 3) then BLASTed
against the list of tag sequences concatenated with primer sequences
for sample assignation (step 4). Only reads with perfect match

Fig. 1. Screenshot of the allele validation step. For illustration, the selected sample L0020 (left frame) is a diploid species Mus cookii from the population
Luang Prabang and has 130 sequences representing 27 variants of DRB gene with two validated alleles. These two validated alleles are in high frequency in the
sample (right frame), respectively, 0.48 (63 sequences) and 0.29 (38 sequences), compared with other variants (frequency < 0.03). Analysis of the sequence
alignment shows that these variants in low frequency display errors (indels, substitutions) or are chimeric recombination of the two validated alleles.

of both tags are assigned to sample, and thus all assigned reads
cover the whole amplicon. All of the assigned reads are kept for
further analyses. For each sample, all reads are aligned by MUSCLE
(Edgar, 2004) or MAFFT (Katoh et al., 2005) according to the
administrator’s choice. Tags and primers are trimmed off (step 5).
An optional position—speciﬁc correction of reads (step 6) can be
performed if standard samples are provided by the user (typically a
single cloned allele ampliﬁed and sequenced along with the samples;
for details see Supplementary Materials).

2.2 Assisted allele validation

Users visualize the alignments of reads for each individual amplicon
with an intuitive GUI. For a selected locus, all samples appear
together with descriptive statistics, such as the number of sequences
and variants assigned to the sample or the number of user—validated
alleles. The number of sequences is displayed in red if too low to
insure high—quality genotyping given the expected ploidy level (see
User guide for details). Identical reads of a sample are pooled into
variants and their numbers and frequencies are provided. Selecting
a sample displays the alignment of all corresponding variants. Each
variant is characterized by its length, its total occurrence in the whole
run and the number of samples in which it is found (Fig. 1). Filters
can be applied to help genotyping (e.g. the minimum number of
reads for a variant; see User guide for details). Users can validate
a variant as an allele by a simple click. A unique allele identiﬁer is
attributed allowing comparisons of genetic diversity among multiple
runs within a project. After allele validation, the genotype table or the
FASTA ﬁle of alleles can be exported. Filtering options are available
to display or export only selected subsets (e. g. run, populations,
species).

Information on a test dataset is available in the Supplementary
Materials.

3 DISCUSSION

Obtaining high number of sequences for amplicons from nuclear
markers brings new challenges with regard to deciphering alleles
from each other and distinguishing weakly ampliﬁed alleles from
sequencing errors. With this respect, bioinformatics tools did not
cope yet with the analysis of amplicons sequenced in this high—
throughput environment. Moreover, user—friendly tools are needed
for sorting and analyzing this type of data, as end users are
interested in the biological information and do not necessarily
have programming or sharp bioinformatics skills. SESAME ﬁlls
this gap and makes routine sequencing as DNA barcoding of a
large number of amplicons at hand. SESAME is resolutely oriented
toward biologists with regard to user—friendly interfacing and easy
installation. Furthermore, most functions to support analyses are
unique and provide a strong and productive framework for high—
throughput amplicon sequencing.

Abstract

Summary: A key to understanding RNA function is to uncover its complex 3D structure.
Experimental methods used for determining RNA 3D structures are technologically challenging
and laborious, which makes the development of computational prediction methods of substantial
interest. Previously, we developed the iFoldRNA server that allows accurate prediction of short
(<50 nt) tertiary RNA structures starting from primary sequences. Here, we present a new version
of the iFoldRNA server that permits the prediction of tertiary structure of RNAs as long as a few
hundred nucleotides. This substantial increase in the server capacity is achieved by utilization of
experimental information such as base—pairing and hydroxyl—radical probing. We demonstrate a
significant benefit provided by integration of experimental data and computational methods.

1 Introduction

The iFoldRNA is a physical simulation—based automated RNA
structure prediction webserver designed to predict 3D RNA struc—
ture based on available sequence data. The previous version of
iFoldRNA allowed prediction of the structure of short RNA mol—
ecules (<50 nt) within 4A Root—Mean—Square deviation (RMSD)
from corresponding experimental structures (Sharma et 61]., 2008).
The limitation on RNA size is due to inaccuracies in the force—field
and insufficient sampling. Increasing sequence size quickly becomes
computationally prohibitive, since the RNA conformational space
grows exponentially. We have previously shown that sampling con—
formational space can be drastically reduced by use of experimental
constraints allowing us to correctly predict the tertiary structure of
RNA up to a few hundred nucleotides long (Ding et 61]., 2012;
Gherghe et 61]., 2009; Lavender et 61]., 2010). Here, we present a se—
cond version of iFoldRNA, which allows automated inclusion of
two categories of constraints: base—pairing and nucleotide solvent
accessibility. The source of base—pairing information can be gener-
ated either by sequence covariation analysis (Gutell et 61]., 1992) or
by using a number of chemical probing techniques. The SHAPE
technique, in particular, has proven to be a quick and effective
method for determining RNA secondary structure (Low et 61].,
2010). To infer solvent accessibility iFoldRNA v2 uses data

from hydroxyl radical probing (HRP) experiments. In HRP, RNA
in solution is treated with reagents that generate hydroxyl radicals,
which cleave RNA strands. By identifying cleavage frequency for
specific nucleotide bonds, solvent exposure can be determined.
Incorporating these data as a burial force in simulations imposes
long—range constraints on folded structures (Ding et 61]., 2012).

2 Methods

The prediction of RNA structure in iFoldRNA v2 is accomplished
using a coarse—grained 3—bead RNA model (Ding et 61]., 2008).
Each bead in this model represents a phosphate, sugar or
nucleobase. Simulations are performed using the Discrete Molecular
Dynamics (DMD) simulation engine (Dokholyan et 61]., 1998).
Base-pairing information is implemented as an additional potential
promoting tertiary contacts between corresponding nucleotides.
An ensemble of RNA molecules at different temperatures that
undergo replica exchange is used to enhance conformation sampling
(Sugita and Okamoto, 1999). Following DMD simulation, one hun-
dred of the lowest energy structures are selected and clustered
according to RMSD between pairs of selected structures. The cen—
troids of the resulting clusters are retained for all—atom
reconstruction.

2.1 HRP constraints

If HRP data are available, an additional force field, effectively bias—
ing RNA towards the correct structure, is applied. The structures
selected for clustering are also required to have high structure—
reactivity correlations (Ding et al., 2012).

2.2 All—atom reconstruction

Conversion to an all—atom representation is performed by replacing
each 3—bead nucleotide by randomly selected rotamers of corres—
ponding nucleotides in an all—atom representation. The initial all-
atom structure is run through a short DMD simulation to connect
bonds and remove clashes. This simulation is performed with a high
heat exchange coefficient, which allows for rapid dissipation of ex-
cess heat generated. A user is allowed to change the values of tem—
peratures used to run replica exchange simulations and the number
of DMD time steps.

Simulations are performed on the Kure computational cluster at
the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill, which consist of
122 blade servers, each with 8—cores 2.80GHz processors running
RHEL 5.6 operating system. The users are able to check the status
of submissions through the server interface and are notified by email
of job completion.

3 Results

The iFoldRNA v2 webserver generates accurate predictions of RNA
tertiary structure using DMD. Predicted structures are typically
within 10—20  RMSD from crystal structures for 200 nt RNA. The
average processing time for an RNA of this size is N1 day. We dem—
onstrate how the inclusion of constraints increases the performance
of the server on the example of M—box riboswitch (161 nt). The
structure of RNA of this size is challenging to predict de novo.
Without constraints the quality of the predicted structure is poor.
RMSD between the predicted and the crystal structures calculated
through phosphate atoms is 32 The interaction network fidelity
(INF) is 0.363 (Parisien et al., 2009). The inclusion of the base—
pairing constraints improves the prediction (RMSD :25 A,
INF : 0.692). The resulting structure has correct base pairing while
most of the higher order tertiary contacts are missing. The addition
of HRP data significantly increases the quality of the prediction
(RMSD : 7.7A, INF : 0.725) (Fig. 1). We observe formation of the
correct secondary and tertiary structures. Closer examination of the
predicted structure using MC Annotate (Gendron et al., 2001)
reveals that it has 39 out of 46 canonical base pairs (AU or CG; A—
adenine, U — uracil, C — cytosine, G—guanine) and 5 out of 6 non—
canonical UG base pairs as compared with the crystal structure. As a
benchmark we used two other servers RNAComposer (Popenda
et al., 2012) and 3dRNA (Zhao et al., 2012). The structure
predicted by RNAComposer (RMSD :25 .8 A, INF : 0.792) has
correct base pairing; however, most of the higher order tertiary con-
tacts are missing. The structure predicted by 3dRNA
(RMSD 222.4 A, INF: 0.621) only partially reproduces correct
base pairing and does not recapitulate most of the higher order ter—
tiary contacts.

4 Conclusions

The iFoldRNA v2 webserver offers a platform that combines experi—
mental data and molecular dynamics simulations to predict tertiary
structures of RNA as long as a few hundred nucleotides with atomic
level detail. The comparison with other servers demonstrates the

superior performance of iFoldRNA v2 for predicting the structure of
long RNA molecules, provided HRP data is available. Currently, the
server operates on two types of experimental constraints that in-
clude base—pairing information and reactivities derived from HRP
experiments. However, there is growing number of approaches used
to translate data from chemical probing experiments to constraints
on RNA structure. For example, the recently proposed RING—MaP
technique (Homan et al., 2014) uses chemical probing, massive par—
allel sequencing and correlation analysis to find nucleotides located
close in space. To keep pace with experimental innovations we plan
to introduce a new interface that allows users to set up constraints
between any two nucleotides of their choice. The iFoldRNA v2 web-
server is freely accessible at http://iFoldRNA.dokhlab.org for aca—
demic and non—profit users.

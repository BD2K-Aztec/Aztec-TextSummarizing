ABSTRACT

Motivation: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are small non-coding RNAs that
regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally. MiRNAs were shown
to play an important role in development and disease, and accurately
determining the networks regulated by these miRNAs in a specific
condition is of great interest. Early work on miRNA target prediction
has focused on using static sequence information. More recently, re-
searchers have combined sequence and expression data to identify
such targets in various conditions.

Results: We developed the Protein Interaction-based MicroRNA
Modules (PIMiM), a regression-based probabilistic method that inte-
grates sequence, expression and interaction data to identify modules
of mRNAs controlled by small sets of miRNAs. We formulate an opti-
mization problem and develop a learning framework to determine the
module regulation and membership. Applying PIMiM to cancer data,
we show that by adding protein interaction data and modeling co-
operative regulation of mRNAs by a small number of miRNAs,
PIMiM can accurately identify both miRNA and their targets improving
on previous methods. We next used PIMiM to jointly analyze a number
of different types of cancers and identified both common and cancer-
type-specific miRNA regulators.

1 BACKGROUND

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are a family of small non-coding RNA
molecules that regulate gene expression post-transcriptionally.
These single-stranded RNAs, 19—25 nt long, are initially tran-
scribed as longer independent genes or from introns of protein-
coding genes. MiRNAs are now known to play a major role in
development (Bartel, 2009), various brain functions (Shao et al.,
2010) and diseases (Meola et al., 2009). Since their discovery,
several 100 miRNAs were identiﬁed in each of several different
species, including mammals, worms, ﬂies and plants (He and
Harmon, 2004). Initial discovery of large sets of miRNAs
relied heavily on sequence and conservation analysis (Bartel,
2009), although recent advances in sequencing capacity are
now allowing researchers to validate and identify additional
miRNAs experimentally (Motameny, 2010). Most miRNAs
target the genes they regulate by binding to the 3’-untranslated
region of the target mRNAs (using complementary base pairing)
and recruiting additional machinery to either degrade these
mRNAs or prevent them from being translated. The miRNA
regulation is ubiquitous, and a single miRNA can target 1003

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

and even 10003 of genes. As the effect of each miRNA on any
single target is often limited, they often work cooperatively with
multiple miRNAs targeting the same mRNA in a speciﬁc con-
dition (Krek et al., 2005; Krol et al., 2010).

Although the set of active miRNAs can often be determined
experimentally (by measuring their expression levels), identifying
their targets is much more challenging. Determining such target
set is important for fully understanding the role of various
miRNAs and to model the networks they regulate in a condition
of interest. Initially, computational methods developed to predict
such targets primarily relied on sequence information, in some
cases, also using conservation information and/or secondary
structure predictions. These methods search for base pair com-
plementarity between the mature miRNA and 3’-untranslated
regions of all mRNAs, allowing for some mismatches (the pen-
alty for mismatches differs between the methods). Popular meth-
ods include TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005), miRBase (now called
MicroCosm) (Griffiths-J ones et al., 2006), miRanda (John et al.,
2004) and PicTar (Krek et al., 2005).

Although these predictions are useful, because of the short
length of miRNAs, they lead to many false positives and some
false negatives (Betel et al., 2010). Conservation analysis has
proven especially problematic in this domain, as several real tar-
gets are not well conserved and would be ignored if conservation
is a requirement (Barakat et al., 2007). In addition, sequence data
are static and do not change in different conditions or at different
times. Thus, based on sequence data alone, it is impossible to
map the set of targets for specific miRNA in a condition of
interest (as most genes are not expressed in any specific condition
or tissue). Finally, miRNAs often work cooperatively in small
groups. As miRNA activation is condition specific, using this
cooperative regulation property requires the use of condition-
specific data, which of course cannot be inferred from sequence
information alone.

Transcription factors (TFs) also play a major role in regulating
gene expression, and they have been shown to work combina-
torially with miRNAs (Sun et al., 2012). However, a pre-requisite
for such combinatorial analysis is a list of targets for individual
miRNAs. Unlike TFs, which can serve as activators or repressors
and are often post-transcriptionally regulated, miRNAs are only
transcriptionally regulated and inhibit their direct targets. This
has led to several studies that isolated the miRNA target predic-
tion task by integrating sequence, mRNA and miRNA expres-
sion data (Cheng and Li, 2008; Huang et al., 2007a; J oung et al.,
2007; Ooi et al., 2011). Unlike sequence data, expression data are
dynamic and condition-specific and thus provide useful clues
about the set of active miRNAs and mRNAs. A number of
methods, mostly based on (anti) correlation or regression ana-
lysis using the expression levels of miRNAs and predicted

mRNA targets, were suggested for this task (Huang et al., 2011;
Wang and Li, 2009). A representative example for this group is
GenMiR++ (Huang et al., 2007a), one of the first methods to
integrate miRNA and mRNA expression profiles in a unified
probabilistic model. Given an expression dataset for both
miRNAs and mRNAs and a set of putative miRNA—mRNA
interactions (inferred from sequence data), GenMiR+—i— uses a
generative probabilistic regression model to assign targets to
miRNAs. It was successfully applied to identify targets of let-
7b in retinoblastoma. Another approach is to project mRNA
expression data on pathway databases and compute the correl-
ation between miRNAs and average pathway expression levels to
identify likely regulators of signaling pathways (Ooi et al., 2011).
Although this method does not identify specific targets, it can be
used to infer the function of specific miRNAs based on the path-
ways they regulate. A number of other methods for integrating
miRNA and mRNA expression data have been proposed, see
(Muniategui et a]. 2012) for a recent review.

Finally, there is growing evidence that interacting proteins are
more likely to be co-regulated by the same miRNAs (Hsu et al.,
2008; Liang and Li, 2007). It has also been shown that some
miRNAs coordinately target protein complexes (Sass et al.,
2011). Although such complementary information may be im-
portant, few previous works have taken advantage of it to pre-
dict condition-specific interactions. An exception is a recent work
by Zhang et a]. (2011), which developed SNMNMF to integrate
protein interactions with miRNA and mRNA expression data.
The method is based on a non-negative matrix factorization ana-
lysis, which factorizes the two expression data matrices such that
the two share one common factor, which is assumed to be the
module basis matrix W. Note, however, that although this
method was successfully applied to analyze Ovarian cancer
data, it does not use a regression model to explain mRNA ex-
pression levels, or requires that miRNAs and mRNAs in
the same module be anti-correlated; therefore, the resulting mod-
ules do not fully use current knowledge regarding the inhibitory
role of miRNAs, which may lead to missing important
interactions.

The methods discussed earlier in the text successfully inte-
grated expression and sequence data. However, a major point
that is often ignored by these prediction methods is the combina-
torial aspect of miRNA regulation. Several studies have shown
that individual miRNAs have only limited impact on their tar-
gets (Malumbres, 2012) and multiple (different) miRNAs are
needed to drastically reduce transcription levels of targets. To
allow the use of such group- or module-based regulatory
model, we have recently developed GroupMiR (Le and Bar-
Joseph, 2011), which uses a non-parametric Bayesian prior
based on the Indian Buffet Process (IBP; Griffiths and
Ghahramani, 2006) to identify modules of co-regulated
miRNAs and their target mRNAs. As we have shown, by
using a module-based approach, we can improve on methods
that treat miRNAs or mRNAs individually improving the set
of correctly recovered miRNA—mRNA interactions (Le and
Bar-Joseph, 2011).

Here, we present the Protein Interaction based MicroRNA
Modules (PIMiM) method, which extends the regression frame-
work of GroupMiR by using an additional type of data: protein
interactions (Fig. 1). As we show, by defining a new target

function that encourages interacting proteins to belong to the
same module, we can use such data and integrate it with expres-
sion and sequence-based data in a probabilistic model. We de-
velop an iterative learning procedure to learn the parameters of
our model and show that it converges to a local minima.
Comparison of PIMiM with previous methods indicates that
by combining a module-based approach with protein interaction
data, we can improve on both methods that only rely on modules
(GroupMiR) and methods that rely on protein interaction
(SNMNMF). We used PIMiM to study miRNA in several
types of cancers, allowing us to identify novel regulators that
either span multiple cancer types or are unique to specific
cancers.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview

We developed PIMiM, a module-based method that predicts targets for
miRNAs by assigning them, together with the mRNAs they regulate, to
one of K modules. Modules may contain several miRNAs and many
mRNAs, and both miRNA and mRNAs can be assigned to 0, 1 or
multiple modules, and thus modules may overlap.

The input to PIMiM is condition-specific miRNA and mRNA expres-
sion data (usually multiple measurements from patients or different time
points). In addition, we use sequence-based predictions of miRNA—
mRNA interactions (any probabilistic predictions can be used) and
static protein interaction data. Using these datasets we learn a regularized
probabilistic regression model in which mRNA data are regressed to the
expression data of miRNAs assigned to modules regulating it. The down-
regulation effect of an miRNA on the expression of its target mRNA is
aggregated across all modules, allowing information to be shared between
modules in the learning process. Our probabilistic model rewards the
assignments of predicted miRNA—mRNA pairs to the same module
and also rewards assignment of mRNAs of interacting proteins to the
same module. Combined, the modules explain the observed mRNA ex-
pression data as a function of their regulating miRNAs and the set of
proteins they interact with.

2.2 Notations

We use the following notation in the rest of the article. We assume there
are M miRNAs and N mRNAs in each sample. We denote expression
profiles of miRNAs by X = (x1, ...,xM)T and of mRNAs by
Y: (yl,  ,yN)T, where x, and yj are vectors with the expression
levels of miRNA i and mRNA j, respectively, in all samples. Both matri-
ces have P columns corresponding to the P—matched samples. In addition,
let S2 (sparse N X N matrix) be the weighted adjacency matrix of the

Reconstructing condition-specific miRNA regulation

 

protein interactions [obtained from databases, such as BioGRID (Stark
et al., 2011) or TRANSFAC (Wingender et al., 2000)] and (I) (sparse
M X N matrix) be the list of predicted interactions of miRNAs and
mRNAs from sequence data (obtained from prediction databases, such
as MicroCosm; Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006). We also deﬁne Iq) and 19 as
binary matrices indicating whether an entry of (I) and S2, respectively, is
non-zero.

For learning K modules, our goal is to determine (learn) the values of
the membership parameters uik and vJ-k, which represent the propensity
that miRNA i or mRNA j belong to module k. Naturally, we restrict
these parameters to be non-negative: uik Z 0 and ij Z 0, where we inter-
pret that an miRNA or an mRNA is not assigned to a module if the
corresponding parameter is zero. We use matrices U = (111, . . . , uM)T and
V 2 (v1, ...,VN)T to represent this complete set of membership param-
eters. Finally, we use the following subscript such as u, k or v, k to denote
the kth column of the matrices.

U, V : miRNA and mRNA module membership
K : number of modules

u,, Vj : ith or jth rows of the matrices

u,k, VJC : kth columns of the matrices

1013,19 : binary indicators of (1), S2

2.3 Probabilistic regression model

Following previous works (Huang et al., 2007b; Le and Bar-Joseph,
2011), we use a regression-based method to link the expression proﬁles
of miRNAs and mRNAs. Expression values of mRNAs are assumed
to be downregulated from a baseline expression level by a linear com-
bination of expression proﬁles of all their predicted miRNA regulators.
For example, mRNA fs expression values are distributed as:

yj ~ N01. — 2,65}, Wl'le', E), where u is the baseline expression level, w,

are weights associated with miRNAs (which previous methods learn in-
dividually for each mRNA) and S]- is the set of predicted miRNA regu-
lators of mRNA j.

We depart from these previous models in how we specify miRNA
regulators and how we learn the weights w,. First, each mRNA is
assumed to be a target of all miRNAs assigned to the modules it belongs
to as long as they are predicted to regulate it ((1),,- 75 0). Formally, mRNA j
is the target of the set of miRNAs SJ- : {i : uiij>0 and (1),-,- 75 0}. Second,
the downregulation weights are aggregated across all modules, such as
Wl'j = ung.

Given these assumptions, the likelihood of the observed expression
values is

 V9 X9 M9  =   — Zu'lerle', E

= HN(y,-m — XT((I¢),,- o (va), 2)
J

where E = diag (0f, . . . , 0%) is the per-sample variance terms.

2.4 Using protein interactions

So far PIMiM only uses expression values in a regression setting (al-
though we constrain the regulators to come from the sequence-based
predicted set, the regression model itself does not directly encourage the
assignment of miRNA and predicted mRNA targets to the same
module).

To incorporate the input interaction data (predicted miRNA—mRNA
pairs (1) and protein interactions S2), we use a function that rewards

assignments to the same module based on the strength of the predicted
edge as follows:

 

l
I..=1U,V= : >1“?-
p( as, | ) 1 +exp(_a >¢UuiTvﬂ 0(05 ¢,ul VJ)
 =   : 1 _ 0—(Ol >u'irvj) 
T
17(1wa = 1W) = 0(13 >wjfvj VJ.)

Where 0: and ,8 are positive tuning parameters that are used to adjust
the contributions of the two types of interaction data in our model and
0(.) is the logistic-sigmoid function. If available (as is the case for the
miRNA—mRNA interaction data), we use probabilities for (I) and S2
derived directly from the prediction or experimental databases (see
Section 4). We deliberately do not include penalty terms for zero entries
of S2 because this interaction matrix is extremely sparse (the number of
known protein—protein interactions is small compared with the total
number of possible interactions). Penalizing zero entries when using
such a sparse matrix would lead to small modules and may be less bio-
logically accurate, as not all co-targets of a miRNA interact.

These terms indicates that the higher the probability of interaction
(both miRNA—mRNA and protein—protein) the more likely it is that
the interacting entities would be assigned to the same set of modules.
This is done globally across all modules. For instance, if (1),]- is positive,
we have previous knowledge that miRNA i and mRNA j interact. To
maximize the likelihood p(¢,-j|U, V), we would need to learn parameters
that lead to large values of uiij, which means that the method is more
likely to place them in the same module.

2.5 Overall log-likelihood

To summarize, our target is to minimize the following negative log-
likelihood:

£(Y, X, (I), Q) = — log p(Y|U, V, X, p, E)

— 2 log pap, IU, V) — 210g paw, = 11V) (3)
’31 1751’

The ﬁrst term evaluates how well the miRNA expression explains
the observed mRNA expression, whereas the second and third terms
are rewards for assigning predicted miRNA—mRNA pairs and protein
interaction pairs to the same module, respectively. This function is non-
convex and thus can have multiple local minima solutions. To constrain
the set of solutions, we add a number of regularization terms. First, we
add two sets of £1 norm constraints for the vectors {u,-} and {VJ}. £1 norm
contraints encourage sparsity leading to smaller and tighter modules. As
our goal is to reduce false positives, such constraints are useful, as they
reduce the set of predicted miRNA—mRNA pairs. Speciﬁcally, we require
that

||u,||1< C1, 1': l, ...,M

11Vj111 E C2, j= 1, ...,N

We are using two different regularization parameters C1 and C2. This
is because the number of miRNAs and mRNAs are different; therefore, a
single number does not yield good solutions. Moreover, we choose to use
these constraints explicitly instead of adding them to the objective func-
tion (using Lagrangian multipliers), as this formulation is simpler to solve
in our optimization procedure.
Together, our learning phase solves the following optimization:
min .7: = £(Y, X, (1), S2)
U:0,V:0, ,1, 2
st. ||u,-||1§C1,i=1,...,M (4)

2.6 Learning the parameters of our model

In this section, we discuss how to solve the optimization problem from (4)
to determine values for the parameters of our model. As aforementioned,
this problem is non-convex, and we cannot analytically compute general
solutions. However, we notice that by holding U and V ﬁxed, we can
solve for u and E in a closed form using standard linear regression:

A 1 N A2 1 N A 2
up =  (ZIP 1' 3’11?) Up =  (Mp _ J’jp _ ij)
j=l j=l

where sz = XTP((I¢.),J~ o (Uvj)) forj= l, ...,N andp =1, ...,P.

To solve for U and V for given values of u and 2, we use a projected
quasi-Newton (PQN) method (Schmidt et al., 2009). Quasi-Newton
methods construct an approximation to the Hessian by using the
observed gradients at successive iterations. We use the MATLAB imple-
mentation min_PQN (http://www.di.ens.fr/mschmidt/Software/PQN.
html). There are several reasons why we chose this method instead of
directly working with the Hessian. First, our set of constraints is convex,
and the projection on this set can be done analytically. Second, although
we can compute both the gradients and Hessian of .7-', the memory
required to store the Hessian is often too large given the dimensions of
the expression data (0((M + N)2K2)). Moreover, because of interactions
between miRNAs and mRNAs, the Hessian is not necessary sparse even
if both (I) and S2 are. During the projection step, to speed-up the conver-
gence of the algorithm, we set the entries of U, which do not have pre-
dicted interactions to zero.

Using the updated values for U and V, we once again solve for u and
E and so on. These two steps lead to an iterative procedure to solve (4)
along the lines of coordinate-descent methods. This procedure converges
to the local minima because of the fact that the objective function is
bounded below, and the sequence of function values is monotonically
decreasing, and the gradients at the convergence are zeros. As the prob-
lem is non-convex, we perform the learning process several times, ran-
domly initializing the parameters each time. After repeating this process
several times (10 iterations in our experiments), we select the parameters
from the result that leads to the lowest value for our objective function.

Finally, the regularization and data-type—weighting parameters
or, ,8, C1 and C2 are chosen based on an external evaluation discussed in
Section 4.

3 CONSTRAINT MODULE LEARNING FOR
MULTIPLE CONDITION ANALYSIS

So far we have discussed our approach for identifying miRNA-
regulated modules using a condition-speciﬁc expression dataset.
Although the optimization problem in Equation (4) can be used
with expression data from multiple conditions (e.g. different
types of cancer), the output is one set of modules for all condi-
tions. In some cases, directly identifying similar and divergent
modules across conditions is an important goal. Consider, for
example, joint analysis of multiple types of cancers. Although
some researchers may be interested in regulatory modules that
are activated in all different cancer types, others may be inter-
ested in unique aspects, or modules, of a speciﬁc cancer type
when compared with other types of cancer.

In our problem, we would like to learn a set of modules for T
different conditions. The interaction input matrices (I) and S2 are
ﬁxed, whereas for each condition I, we have a set of expression
measurements X, and Y,. Given this input, we jointly learn T sets
of modules {U’ , V’ },:15m 5 T. The number of modules is also ﬁxed
for all conditions.

This type of learning is called multi-task learning (Caruana,
1997) in the machine-learning community, where many related
models are learned simultaneously using the same internal rep-
resentation. Such learning allows different models (or cancer
types) to share some parameters, which improves learning
while at the same time it can also identify unique parameters
for speciﬁc types. In several cases, such framework was shown
to lead to better solutions (Caruana, 1997). Many existing meth-
ods proposed for multi-task learning focus on multi-output re-
gression problems, where it is often desirable to obtain sparse
solutions by performing covariate selection. They rely on regu-
larization technique to jointly select a set of covariates that are
relevant to many tasks. One can apply 61/62 penalty of group
lasso to select covariates relevant to all tasks (Obozinski et al.,
2010).

Here, we adopt the 61/62 penalty of group lasso to regularize
the modules over T conditions with the following penalty:

(213204: my)
1', k z j, k z

This penalty encourages entries {ujk},:1j  a T and {vjfk},:15  a T to
be selected together, which means that miRNAs and mRNAs are
assigned to the same modules across conditions. As the penalty is
not differentiable at 0, we reformulate the optimization problem
by moving the non-differentiable part to the constraints as sug-
gested in (Liu et al., 2009):

min .73—1—21 Zaik—i—ijk
U205V205M525{aik5bjk} l. k j k

s.t. 1204,92 E aik; 1X:(v§k)2 E bik (5)

llui111< C1; 11Vj111 E C2

i=1,...,M;j=l,...,N;k=l,...K

Here, we have introduced new variables {aik} and {bjk} into the
problem. We update the projection step in Section 2.6 with the
projection on the new 62 norm balls in the constraint set as
shown in Liu et a]. (2009) (Theorem 4).

4.1 MiRNA regulation in ovarian cancer

To test PIMiM and to compare it with previous methods for
determining condition-speciﬁc miRNA regulation (SNMNMF
and GroupMiR), we use the ovarian cancer dataset from
Zhang et a]. (2011). This dataset contains 385 samples from
cancer patients, each measuring the expression of 559 miRNAs
and 12456 mRNAs and was downloaded from the Cancer
Genome Atlas data portal (TCGA) (https://tcga-data.nci.nih.
gov/tcga/). In addition to expression data, the sequence-based
prediction of miRNA—mRNA interactions was downloaded
from MicroCosm (Grifﬁths-J ones et al., 2006), and protein inter-
action data were downloaded from TRANSFAC (\Ningender
et al., 2000). We only use MicroCosm here to allow a fair com-
parison with SNMNMF, which only uses these data. In subse-
quent analysis, we use other sequence-based prediction methods
as well. To evaluate the accuracy of each method, we used a set

Reconstructing condition-specific miRNA regulation

 

of 115 cancer miRNAs that were determined to participate in
ovarian cancer in a recent review article (Koturbash et al., 2011;
Tables 1 and 2). Using this set we compute the precision, recall
and F1 score (the harmonic mean of precision and recall) of the
set of miRNAs identiﬁed by each method.

The number of modules K was set to 50 for the non-negative
matrix factorization method (SNMNMF) as suggested in Zhang
et al. (2011). PIMiM also requires setting regularization and
weight parameters a, ,8, C1 and C2. To set these, we performed
an iterative line search (holding three of the four parameters
ﬁxed and adjusting the value of the fourth until convergence)
to determine the values of these parameters using the F1 score
as the target function to optimize. Based on this analysis, we
selected K :40 for PIMiM (see Supplementary Fig. S3 for de-
tails). SNMNMF was also run with the optimized set of param-
eters and input data described in Zhang et al. (2011). Unlike
PIMiM and SNMNMF, GroupMiR uses a non-parametric
Bayesian prior for the number of modules; therefore, this
number cannot be ﬁxed in advance. Thus, for GroupMiR, we
report modules and interactions with posterior probability at
least 0.3 to get a set of comparable size with other methods.
Previously, GroupMiR was shown to outperform several other
methods (Le and Bar-Joseph, 2011) including GenMiR++
(Huang et al., 2007b); therefore, we omitted comparison with
these methods here. Figure 2 presents a graphical view of the
modules identiﬁed by PIMiM and SNMNMF. We color inter-
action edges between genes using different colors for each
module. The modules identiﬁed by PIMiM are more dense
and, hence, are in better agreement with previous ﬁndings re-
garding the regulation of interacting proteins by miRNAs.

4.1.] Evaluation: identifying cancer miRNAs We ﬁrst looked at
the set of miRNAs identiﬁed by each method (those belonging to
the modules returned by each of the methods). The results in
Table 1 demonstrate that using the protein interaction data
greatly increases precision, recall and the F1 score. Both methods
that use these data (PIMiM and SNMMNF) clearly outperform
GroupMiR on this set. In addition, using a regression model also
helps as indicated by the increase in F1 score PIMiM obtains
over SNMNMF.

4.1.2 Expression coherence In addition to analyzing the set of
identiﬁed miRNAs, we also computed the average anti-correl-
ation between miRNAs and mRNAs in the modules identiﬁed
by each of the methods (Table 1). In this analysis, GroupMiR
achieves the highest anti-correlation between miRNAs and the
mRNAs they regulate in a module. This is the result of a much
smaller module size identiﬁed by GroupMiR. As protein inter-
actions are not used, mRNAs in these modules are selected be-
cause they are strongly anti-correlated with the miRNAs
predicted to regulate the modules. This requirement leads to
smaller modules and a better (anti) correlation between
miRNAs and mRNAs. Still, PIMiM improves on SNMNMF
in identifying anti-correlated miRNA—mRNA pairs.
SNMNMF’s objective function does not explicitly include a
component for expression anti-correlation between miRNAs
and mRNAs, which may explain why it does not capture the
inhibitory role of miRNAs. Thus, PIMiM provides a useful com-
promise between relying strongly on protein interactions, which

4.1.3 MSigDB enrichment analysis To test the biological func-
tion of the modules, we used 880 gene sets of canonical pathways
(C2-CP, v.3.0) from MSigDB (Subramanian et al., 2005). We
used the hypergeometric distribution to compute enrichment
P—values for each of the modules with each of the MSigDB
gene sets. To correct for the multiple hypothesis testings, we
used the Benjamini—Hochberg procedure implemented in the R
function p.adjust, which computes a q-value for each intersec-
tion. The results are presented in Figure 3, which depicts the
number of modules with at least one enriched set in the

Fig. 3. MSigDB enrichment analysis: pathway enrichment analysis was
done using 880 gene sets of canonical pathways (C2-CP) from MSigDB
(Subramanian et al., 2005). P—values were computed using hypergeo-
metric test (with 10000 random permutations) on the intersection of
the set of genes in each module with MSigDB gene sets. Benjamini—
Hochberg procedure was used to control the false discovery rate.

MSigDB enrichment analysis and the total number of unique
enriched gene sets. PIMiM outperforms SNMNMF, achieving
both better enrichment for individual modules and better cover-
age of different MSigDB sets. MSigDB pathways are biased
toward cancer pathways and so may be more relevant for the
data we are analyzing here than Gene Ontology analysis. In
addition to cancer hits, top hits for MSigDB include signatures
for ,8 cells that have been linked to cancer (Pelengaris and Khan,
2001) and several translation-related categories.

4.1.4 The eﬂect of ,8 on the performance of PIMiM To test the
effects of using the protein interaction data in PIMiM, we re-run
PIMiM with different ,8 values. The results are presented in
Figure 4. As the ﬁgure shows, when decreasing the value of ,8,
the performance of PIMiM on all evaluation metrics decreases
indicating the protein protein interactions (PPI) data are useful
for identifying coherent modules. On the other hand, increasing
,8 too much leads to high weight for PPI data at the expense of
the expression information, which also negatively affects the per-
formance of PIMiM. Thus, balancing the two data types, which
is done by setting an intermediate value for ,8 is key to the success
of PIMiM.

4.2 Integrating data from multiple types of cancers

To further investigate miRNA control of different cancers, we
applied PIMiM to a dataset of three cancer types using the multi-

task learning framework described in Section 3. We learn three
sets of modules for three types of cancer: breast invasive carcin-
oma (BRCA), Glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) and acute mye-
loid leukemia (AML). The miRNA and gene expression proﬁles
of 89 BRCA, 498 GBM and 173 AML patients were downloaded
from the TCGA. This set has 285 miRNAs and 10922 mRNAs
in common. Here, we combine the miRNA—mRNA predicted
interactions from three public databases [MicroCosm
(Grifﬁths-Jones et al., 2006), miRanda (John et al., 2004) and
TargetScan (Lewis et al., 2005)] and protein interaction data
from TRANSFAC (Wingender et al., 2000). For each cancer
type, PIMiM learns 1 set of 50 modules. The parameters were
set by optimizing for the F1 score of identifying miRNAs rele-
vant to this dataset based on the set of cancer-related miRNAs
from Koturbash et al. (2011). Figure 5 displays the miRNA-
regulating modules in all three cancer types.

4.2.1 Analysis of identiﬁed miRNAs Several of the modules
identiﬁed by PIMiM are regulated by known cancer miRNAs.
The overall F1 score for cancer miRNAs for the joint analysis
was high for all three cancer types: BRCA (0.6167), GBM
(0.5789) and AML (0.6111). Well-known cancer miRNAs re-
ported by PIMiM include the let-7b/c/d/e (active in BRCA: Yu
et al., 2007, GBM: Lee et al., 2011 and AML: Jongen-Lavrencic
et al., 2008), mirR-302a/b/c/d cluster [suppression of the CDK2
and CDK4/6 cell cycle pathways (Lin et al., 2010)] and miR—96
(active in BRCA: Guttilla and White, 2009, AML: Zhao et al.,
2010, miR—34a (active in BRCA: O’Day and Lal, 2010, GBM: Li
et al., 2009, AML: Zenz et al., 2009, miR-15a/b (active in AML:
Calin et al., 2008). Some members of the miR-17-92 cluster
(miR-18b, miR-19a, miR-20a/b and miR-93) are also identiﬁed
by PIMiM (active in BRCA: Mendell, 2008, GBM: Ernst et al.,
2010, AML: Mi et al., 2010). Note that some well-known cancer
miRNAs, including miR-17 and miR-92, are missing from the
modules because their expression is not available for enough of
the samples. Several other subsets of miRNAs were assigned to

Fig. 5. Inferred miRNA modules of the three cancer types (BRCA, GBM and AML). The x-axis shows the 50 X 3 modules learned for the three cancer
types (each x-axis bar is subdivided into three with the color corresponding to the cancer type). The y-axis shows miRNAs ordered by hierarchical
clustering of their module membership vector. In several cases, the same miRNAs are predicted for all or two of the three cancer types

cooperatively regulate modules in multiple types of cancer as
shown in Figure 5.

4.2.2 Cancer-specific miRNAs In addition to ﬁnding common
cancer regulators, PIMiM can be used to identify cancer-type—
speciﬁc regulators. These can either be used as biomarkers for a
sub-type or can be studied to determine the unique properties of
each cancer type. Although it is hard to obtain negative infor-
mation (i.e. an article that mentions that a certain miRNA does
not regulate a speciﬁc cancer type) several of the predictions
made by PIMiM agree with current literature that, at least so
far, only mentions their role in the cancer they were assigned to
by PIMiM. Table 2 lists a few of these miRNAs and the cancer
type they were predicted to regulate.

4.2.3 Analyzing the miRNAs and mRNAs in an identified
module In addition to identifying important miRNAs for this
particular study, PIMiM returns a set of modules providing

predictions of cooperative regulation of miRNAs and their
mRNAs targets. To demonstrate the informative power of this
modular structure, we analyze in more details one of these mod-
ules (see also Supplementary Results for detailed discussion of
other modules). Figure 6 depicts a network of miRNAs and
mRNAs identiﬁed as part of Module 11. Across all cancer
types, PIMiM identiﬁed a set of 14 strongly connected proteins.
MiR-200a/b/c, miR-141 and miR-429 are predicted to regulate
this set of mRNAs in all types of cancer. These miRNAs have
previously been reported to play a role in cancer and cell prolif-
eration (Korpal et al., 2008; Peter, 2009). Interestingly, the miR-
200 family is located in two chromosomal regions on 1p36.33
(200b, 200a and 429) and 12p13.31 (200c and 141), respectively
(Uhlmann et al., 2010), which may support our prediction of
their cooperative regulation. Applying Gene Ontology analysis
[using FuncAssociate (Berriz et al., 2009)] and MSigDB enrich-
ment analysis to the set of 14 mRNAs in this module indicates

that this set is enriched with members of transcription factor
TFTC/STAGA and TFFIID complexes. Recent ﬁndings sup-
port the link between these complexes and cancer (Kurabe
et al., 2007). This module also includes a tumor suppressor
gene MSH2 (\Nada—Hiraike et al., 2005) and a famous breast
cancer susceptibility gene BRCAl (Miki et al., 1994).

5 CONCLUSIONS

We presented PIMiM, a new method for inferring condition-spe-
ciﬁc regulation of miRNAs and for identifying their targets.
PIMiM combines sequence, expression and interaction data to
discover miRNA-regulated modules of mRNAs. We use a prob-
abilistic model that combines regression with network informa-
tion to discover these modules. We developed an iterative
learning procedure to learn the parameters of our model and a
multi-task learning method for combining data from multiple
conditions.

We tested PIMiM on ovarian cancer expression data and have
shown that it correctly identiﬁes miRNAs regulating this cancer
type, and that it is able to group relevant genes together.
Comparison with other methods indicates that by using protein
interaction data, we can improve accuracy while at the same time
PIMiM also maintains expression coherence among mRNAs
and anti-correlation between miRNAs and the mRNAs they
are predicted to regulate improving on previous methods that
have also used protein interaction data. Application of the
method to compare and contrast three types of cancer identiﬁed
both common and unique regulators, which can allow re-
searchers to determine the core cancer regulatory network and
the differences in regulation among the various cancers we
studied.

Although we believe PIMiM can already be of use to re-
searchers that collect mRNA and miRNA expression data,

there are a number of extensions that can further improve it.
As aforementioned, we follow several other articles in isolating
the miRNA target prediction task from the combinatorial ana-
lysis of miRNA—TF regulation. Although such an approach
leads to good results as discussed earlier in the text, our longer
term goal is to develop a method that can incorporate both types
of regulation in a single-modeling framework. For this, we would
need to determine the role a speciﬁc TF plays (activator or re-
pressor) and its activity level [either based on its expression levels
or on the set of its targets (Shi et al., 2009)]. With this informa-
tion, we can incorporate TFs into our regression model to ac-
count for their part in regulating expression, which will hopefully
lead to better results regarding the role played by speciﬁc
miRNAs. The regression component that we considered in
PIMiM uses a simple linear model to explain the regulation
effect of multiple miRNAs. We could also extend this to incorp-
orate other complex combinatorial analysis (for example, AND,
OR logic). However, this requires an extension of the methods
derived in the article. We thus leave this for future work. In
addition, we would like to incorporate additional types of
high-throughput data, for example, epigenetic data to our ana-
lysis framework.

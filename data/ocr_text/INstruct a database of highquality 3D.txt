ABSTRACT

Summary: INstruct is a database of high-quality, 3D, structurally
resolved protein interactome networks in human and six model organ-
isms. INstruct combines the scale of available high-quality binary pro-
tein interaction data with the specificity of atomic-resolution structural
information derived from co—crystal evidence using a tested interaction
interface inference method. Its web interface is designed to allow for
flexible search based on standard and organism-specific protein and
gene-naming conventions, visualization of protein architecture high-
lighting interaction interfaces and viewing and downloading custom
3D structurally resolved interactome datasets.

Availability: INsthct is freely available on the web at http:/ﬁnstruct.
yulab.org with all major browsers supported.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interactions demonstrate functional principles of
biological processes because most proteins carry out their cellular
functions by interacting with other proteins. The set of all protein
interactions within an organism, known as the ‘interactome’, is
often represented as a network (Pawson and Nash, 2000; Vidal,
2005). Interactome networks are powerful resources for biolo-
gists because they help elucidate the interconnected nature of
signaling and communication within cellular systems. It has
also been suggested that mechanistic explanations of many
human diseases can be obtained by studying alterations to this
network (Barabasi et al., 2011; Vidal et al., 2011). For example, a
global guilt-by—association principle has been widely used to pre-
dict disease genes by dissecting molecular networks (Oliver,
2000).

However, for an interactome network to be successfully
applied in biological studies, it is imperative that it incorporate
the intricate structural details of proteins within the network
and not simply treat the proteins as mathematical points in a

graph-theoretic network (Schuster-Bockler and Bateman, 2008;
Wang et al., 2012). As structure is the basis of protein function
(Lahiry et al., 2010), elucidating structural details of interactions
can help reﬁne our current understanding of biochemical func-
tion from protein—protein interaction networks (Barabasi and
Oltvai, 2004).

Here, we present INstruct (http://instruct.yulab.org), a com-
prehensive database of high-quality, 3D, structurally resolved
protein interactome networks in human and six widely studied
model organisms. To our knowledge, INstruct is the ﬁrst online
repository containing structurally resolved interaction interfaces
between proteins for which no co-crystal structure is available.
To accomplish this, we used an interaction interface inference
method (Wang et al., 2012) to structurally resolve interactions
based on 37 210 known co-crystal structures in the PDB (Berman
et al., 2000). In total, INstruct currently contains 6585 human,
644 Arabidopsis thaliana, 120 Caenorhabditis elegans, 166
Drosophila melanogaster, 119 Mus musculus, 1273 Saccharomyces
cerevisiae and 37 Schizosaccharomyces pombe structurally
resolved interactions. As a comprehensive database providing
structural details not previously annotated in protein interactome
networks, INstruct will be an invaluable resource in a wide array
of biological research.

2 METHODS

Binary protein—protein interaction data used to build INstruct was
curated from eight major interaction databases—BioGrid (Stark et al.,
2011), DIP (Salwinski et al., 2004), HPRD (Keshava Prasad et al., 2009),
IntAct (Kerrien et al., 2012), iRefWeb (Turner et al., 2010), MINT
(Licata et al., 2012), MIPS (Mewes et al., 2011) and VisAnt Oiu et al.,
2009). Not all organisms included in INstruct derived interaction data
from every database. These interactions were then ﬁltered to meet strict
high-conﬁdence criteria (Das and Yu, 2012) resulting in 61 108 high-qual-
ity binary interactions for all seven organisms (Fig. 1 and Supplementary
Note S1). It should be noted that none of the protein—protein interactions
with co-crystal structures are ﬁltered out of INstruct.

To add structural resolution to our high-quality binary interactome
networks, we leveraged the information in several protein databases.
Using protein domain deﬁnitions from Pfam GDunta et al., 2012), we
identiﬁed ‘Pfam-A’ domains, which are both ‘signiﬁcant’ and ‘in-full’
as deﬁned by Pfam that also appear in proteins in our high-quality
binary interactome networks. To determine the domains mediating the
protein—protein interactions in our network, we gathered domain inter-
action data from 3did (Stein et al., 2009) and inam (Finn et al., 2005),
which in turn derive their domain—domain interaction evidence from

Fig. 1. A ﬂow chart showing the sources and three stages of data processing used to create the 3D interactomes in INstruct. (1) Constructing high-quality
binary interactomes. Interactomes for each of the seven organisms were created by collecting protein—protein interactions from each of the shown
databases. We removed inter-organism interactions, non-binary interactions, interactions from high-throughput (HT) studies that are not a part of the
author’s high-conﬁdence dataset (core), interactions from low-quality HT studies and unvalidated interactions. (2) Obtaining structural annotations. By
collecting high-quality structural annotation data, we produced a set of domain—domain interactions supported by atomic-resolution co-crystal struc-
tures. (3) Determining structurally resolved interactions. We used a method of homology-based interaction interface inference to structurally resolve

interaction interfaces for interacting proteins

37210 existing 3D atomic-resolution co-crystal structures in the PDB.
In all, 1708 protein—protein interactions in our binary interactomes
are directly represented by one of these co-crystal structures, in
which case it is straightforward to determine where the pair of proteins
interacts.

For 7236 protein—protein interactions not supported by direct co-crys-
tal evidence, we applied a tested interaction interface inference method
Wang et al., 2012) to extend the scope of the interaction data provided
by 3did and inam (Fig. 1). For these interactions, we predicted the inter-
face domains based on co-crystal structures of homologous domains for
one or both partners (Supplementary Note S2). Although 3did and inam
indicate pairs of homologous domains that have been shown to interact
in co-crystal structures of pairs of proteins, INstruct is the ﬁrst source to
predict that these domain—domain interactions facilitate protein—protein
interactions for which no co-crystal structure exists.

Although we have demonstrated high conﬁdence in the ability of our
method to identify the domains at protein interaction interfaces, it is
important to note the inherent difference in resolution available for inter-
faces determined directly from co-crystal evidence versus those that were
inferred using homologous structures. Atomic-resolution information is
only available for interactions with co-crystal structures, whereas inter-
action interfaces inferred from homology are resolved to the level of
protein domains. To maintain uniformity, INstruct displays only
domain-level information for all interactions. When available, atomic-
resolution information is easily accessible through direct links to the
PDB.

In total, these methods yielded 8944 3D protein—protein interactions
with structurally resolved interaction interfaces. Full network statistics
are available in Supplementary Table S1.

3 USAGE

A web-based interface is deployed for accessing these interac-
tomes, which includes ﬁve basic features: (i) searching for pro-
teins, (ii) retrieval of interaction data, (iii) visualization of protein
domains, (iv) creation of custom downloadable datasets and
(v) downloading of entire interactome datasets.

A protein in any organism can be queried using its Universal
Protein Resource (UniProt) accession ID (UniProt Consortium,
2011) or its corresponding standard gene symbol. Additionally,
each organism has a single searchable alternate identiﬁer used by
a popular organism-speciﬁc database. The standard query inter-
face (shown in Supplementary Fig. S1) accepts multiple simul-
taneous queries using any combination of the three available
identiﬁers for each organism.

Users are taken directly to the results page if one or more of
their queries match an entry in INstruct. This page shows the
results for each query linearly down the page in the order that
they appeared in the query. Each matching query returns three
types of output: (i) naming information, (ii) schematics showing

the domain-level interactions and (iii) sortable tables providing
information about domain—domain interactions. The sidebar
always contains the search box, for reﬁnement of search terms,
and a dialog for downloading the complete set of interactions
that match all terms in the query.

For each protein that interacts with a query protein, a sche-
matic is shown, displaying the domain architecture of both pro-
teins side-by—side as linear models according the order of their
amino acids (an example is shown in Supplementary Fig. S1).
Between each pair of proteins, domains that interact are indi-
cated in green and those that do not are indicated in gray.
Network edges are drawn between domains that interact on
the two proteins, with edges colored in red indicating domain
interactions derived directly from co-crystal evidence, and edges
in gray indicating domain—domain interactions inferred by hom-
ology. Regardless of whether a domain is involved in a structur-
ally resolved interaction, all domain information is interactive
and linked to further information provided on the Pfam website.

Interactions involving the queried protein and each of its inter-
acting partners are shown in a table below each schematic and
can be sorted by domain on either protein, on the number of
publications supporting this interaction, or on the number of
supporting PDB structures. PDB structures that provide direct
co-crystal evidence for the indicated domain—domain interaction
are shown in red, and all other PDB structures provide hom-
ology-based evidence and are shown in blue. External references,
including Pfam links to each domain in the interacting pair, pub-
lication information from PubMed, and PDB structures support-
ing each interaction, can be accessed by clicking on their
corresponding entry in the table.

Additionally, each search produces a tab-delimited text ﬁle
containing all relevant information about the interactions as
shown on the results page, including all available naming con-
ventions and amino acid locations of the interacting domains. A
custom dataset can be created simply by searching for up to
ﬁve proteins at once, separating each term with a delimiter in
the search ﬁeld, or by uploading a ﬁle of identiﬁers on the
downloads page. All valid search terms will be added to the
downloadable ﬁle and displayed on the results page.

When available, the domain—domain interaction pairs that fa-
cilitate the shown protein interactions on the results page will
appear in the sidebar on the right side of the results page.
Underneath each domain—domain pair is given a list of proteins
that interact via the same domain—domain pair. Proteins in red
provide the direct co-crystal evidence for the given domain—
domain interaction. In other words, a co-crystal containing
each protein in red proves the existence of the domain—domain
interaction in the ﬁrst place and allows us to resolve other pro-
tein—protein interactions to include this domain—domain
interaction.

4 CONCLUSION

INstruct will be a useful tool in a broad spectrum of fundamental
biological research. With the continued growth of data sources,
especially available co-crystal structures in the PDB, we expect

the coverage of our structurally resolved interactome networks to
increase over time (Chandonia and Brenner, 2006). We plan to
update INstruct at least once per year to incorporate newly avail-
able information and to expand our repertoire of model organ-
isms. As more structural data become available, we will build
more comprehensive 3D, structurally resolved interactome net-
works for different organisms.

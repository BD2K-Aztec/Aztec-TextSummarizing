ABSTRACT

Summary: Mixed model-based approaches to genome-wide
association studies (GWAS) of binary traits in related individuals
can account for non-genetic risk factors in an integrated manner.
However, they are technically challenging. GLOGS (Genome-wide
LOGistic mixed model/Score test) addresses such challenges with
efficient statistical procedures and a parallel implementation. GLOGS
has high power relative to alternative approaches as risk covariate
effects increase, and can complete a GWAS in minutes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Although many genome-wide association studies (GWAS) are of
unrelated populations and do not include the effects of non-
genetic predictors, it is also of interest to study populations with
family structures or cryptic relatedness while incorporating the
effects of covariates (Price et al., 2010). Mixed model-based
methods represent traits as a function of observed covariates and
unknown random effects and are attractive for such problems
because these effects are addressed in a direct and integrated
manner. In such methods, the mean of the trait is affected by the
observed covariates and the genetic marker being tested, whereas
the random effects inﬂuence the trait’s variance and correlation
structure. Early implementations of the mixed model approach for
quantitative traits include SOLAR (Almasy and Blangero, 1998).
More recently, improvements in the efﬁciency of statistical methods,
computing power and software engineering (Zhang et al., 2009)
have made the approach feasible for analyses of quantitative traits
using genome-wide data, as systems such as TASSEL (Bradbury
et al., 2007) and EMMAX (Kang et al., 2010) illustrate. Given these
successes, further development of mixed model methods for GWAS
is desirable, especially for binary traits.

In this article we describe Genome-wide LOGistic mixed
model/Score test (GLOGS), a mixed model-based system for GWAS
of binary traits in populations with related individuals. GLOGS
performs a GWAS by (1) estimating parameters of a logistic risk
model based on non-genetic covariates and a polygenic effect and

(2) evaluating associations between markers and the disease using
score tests. Simulation studies demonstrate that this approach yields
comparatively high-statistical power, especially as covariate effects
on risk increase. Additionally, GLOGS achieves a high degree
of computational tractability through parallelization. GLOGS can
complete GWAS in minutes, allowing investigations of a variety of
possible covariates to be conducted in a timely manner.

2 METHODS

2.1 Likelihood model and score test

For each individual n=1,...,N we observe a binary trait yn, a vector of
covariates xn, and genotypes from M biallelic markers, where gmm is the
number of alleles of a particular type at the mth marker. We suppose that
the probability of individual It carrying the trait (pn) is inﬂuenced by an
unobserved polygenic effect an, where a1,...,aN is N (0, 2) distributed, 2
accounting for relatedness and population structure.

Conditional on an we consider a logistic model relating covariates, the
mth marker, and polygenic effects to risk; pn = logit‘1 (,8 Txn + Vgn,m +oan)
where ,8,y and o are the effects of the ﬁxed, genetic and polygenic
covariates. The related likelihood function is:

L(ﬂ,V,U)=/RN 6Xp(la(ﬂ,y,0))h(a)da (1)
N

la(ﬂ,y,0)=zynln(pn)+(1-yn)1n(1-pn) (2)
n=1

where h is a multivariate normal (0,2) distribution.

Based on Eqation (1), GLOGS performs GWAS by estimating parameters
under the null model H0 : y :0 Via maximum likelihood, and calculating
score statistics at each marker to evaluate H0 versus HA : y 750. If the mth
marker has no effect, its corresponding score statistic is x12 distributed.

2.2 Implementation

Since Equation (1) and its derivatives do not have closed form solutions, we
approximate them with weighted sums over a random sample or cubature.
We calculate maximum-likelihood parameter estimates with a sampling—
importance—resampling approach, and evaluate score statistics conditional
on parameter estimates and posterior cubature weights. Details are provided
in the Supplementary Material. GLOGS was implemented in C and MP1.

2.3 Simulation studies

We studied the performance of GLOGS with simulation studies of 369
individuals from the Hutterite population (Ober et al., 1998, 2000), related
through a 13-generation, 3028 member pedigree. We computed kinship
coefﬁcients d3 for these individuals with IdCoefs (Abney, 2009), supposed
additive genetic effects and set 2 =2<I>. We considered several risk models
conditioned on a single marker, sex and the polygenic effect, representing
a range of individual and relative risks (Table 1, explicit models are in
the Supplementary Material). For each model, 100 sets of 1000 unlinked

RRmale, RRg and SR represent relative risks for males, 1 or 2 risk allele and sibling relative risks, respectively. Marker-wise type I errors and powers are expressed as percentages.
Run times are given as time to perform model estimation plus perform 1000 marker score tests.

biallelic markers with 25% minor allele frequency were sampled by gene
dropping. For each set of markers we sampled polygenic effects and trait
statuses.

We evaluated the simulated data with GLOGS using a transformed
400 000 point Sobol cubature, computed run times, identiﬁed markers that
rejected H0 under a Bonferroni-controlled 5% test, and compared the results
from GLOGS with those from WQLS (Bourgain et al., 2003) and MQLS
(Thornton and McPeek, 2007). We additionally evaluated the sensitivity of
GLOGS to cubature size by reanalyzing the data from model A using an
800 000 point cubature; results are provided in the Supplementary Material.
These studies were performed using all cores of an Apple Mac Pro with two
3 GHz quad-core Intel Xeons and 8 GB of RAM, running OS X 10.5.8.

3 RESULTS

Table 1 shows marker-wise type I errors, powers and run times for
our analyses. To obtain a 5% experiment-wise type I error rate,
we used a Bonferroni controlled marker-wise type I error rate of
0.005%; no method has error rates signiﬁcantly differing from this
target. Detection power ranged from 2—83, 5—90 and 27—88% for
WQLS, MQLS and GLOGS, respectively. For GLOGS, null model
estimation was performed in under 2 min, and calculating score
statistics for 1000 markers took under half-a—second.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we addressed mixed model-based GWAS of binary
traits in populations of related individuals, where risk is affected by
non-genetic factors. Our approach, GLOGS, calculates maximum
likelihood parameter estimates for a logistic mixed model and then
uses score tests to evaluate associations. We note that alternatives
exist for both of these steps (Chen et al., 2011). Our use of maximum
likelihood estimation is motivated by our use of the score test, which
is based on maximum-likelihood estimation under the null model.

GLOGS improves upon other methods for GWAS of binary traits
in related populations by offering direct support for risk covariates,
in a system that is also powerful for studies that omit such covariates.
This is demonstrated in Table 1, which suggests that GLOGS is
roughly as powerful as the MQLS package when risk covariates have
little effect, and more powerful for analyses with larger covariate
effects. This is expected, as both methods are based on score tests
and MQLS does not offer direct covariate support.

Additionally, GLOGS offers fast run times due to its use of the
score test and parallelization of parameter estimation procedure.
Typically, the total time required to perform a GWAS with GLOGS
is primarily based on parameter estimation, which is done once
per analysis with run time inversely proportional to the number of
processors used. Score testing is comparatively fast. In Table 1,

1000 score tests were performed in ~0.1% of the time of the
parameter estimation step; increasing the number of markers 100-
fold would yield an increased run time of 10%. In contrast, for
MQLS and the methods discussed in Chen et al. (2011), a 100-fold
increase in the number of markers would result in approximately a
100-fold increase in run time. Consistent with other methods, run
times for GLOGS increase with the number of individuals studied.
We have used GLOGS in GWAS of over 800 highly related
individuals and 250 000 markers, controlling for multiple binary,
integer and continuous risk covariates. Such analyses take
~20 min to perform with the computer hardware used in our
simulation studies. A current version of GLOGS is provided at
http://www.bioinformatics.org/~stanhope/GLOGS.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Meta-analysis of summary statistics is an essential
approach to guarantee the success of genome-wide association
studies (GWAS). Application of the fixed or random effects model to
single-marker association tests is a standard practice. More complex
methods of meta-analysis involving multiple parameters have not been
used frequently, a gap that could be explained by the lack of a re-
spective meta-analysis pipeline. Meta-analysis based on combining
p-values can be applied to any association test. However, to be
powerful, meta-analysis methods for high-dimensional models
should incorporate additional information such as study-specific prop-
erties of parameter estimates, their effect directions, standard errors
and covariance structure.

Results: We modified ‘method for the synthesis of linear regression
slopes’ recently proposed in the educational sciences to the case of
multiple logistic regression, and implemented it in a meta-analysis tool
called METAINTER. The software handles models with an arbitrary
number of parameters, and can directly be applied to analyze the results
of single-SNP tests, global haplotype tests, tests for and under gene—
gene or gene—environment interaction. Via simulations for two-single
nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) models we have shown that the pro-
posed meta—analysis method has correct type I error rate. Moreover,
power estimates come close to that of the joint analysis of the entire
sample. We conducted a real data analysis of six GWAS of type 2 dia-
betes, available from dbGaP (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/gap). For
each study, a genome-wide interaction analysis of all SNP pairs was
performed by logistic regression tests. The results were then meta-
analyzed with METAINTER.

1 INTRODUCTION

The need to summarize the results of related genome-wide asso-
ciation studies (GWAS) has encouraged the rapid development of
new meta-analytic methods and tools, see e.g. (Liu et al., 2013b;

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

Magi and Morris, 2010; Tang and Lin, 2013; Willer et al., 2010).
Meta-analysis of summary statistics is expected to deliver new
susceptibility loci without additional genotype and phenotype
data being required (de Bakker et al., 2010). Application of the
general ﬁxed effects model (Becker, 1994; Cochran, 1937)
to single-marker 1 degree of freedom (df) association tests has
become a standard practice. More complex models involving mul-
tiple parameters have been used much less frequently, presumably
in view of power issues but also because of the absence of a re-
spective meta-analysis pipeline. The need for meta-analysis mul-
tiple parameter methods has been recognized in the ﬁeld
(Evangelou and Ioannidis, 2013), and new approaches for per-
forming meta-analysis of rare variant association tests have re-
cently been described in (Liu et al., 2013b).

Fisher’s combination test (Fisher, 1932), Stouffer’s method
(or inverse normal method; Stouffer et al., 1949) and Stouffer’s
method with weights (Becker, 1994; Liptak, 1959; Zaykin, 2011)
are common approaches for combining p-values. However, by
design, they do not take advantage of additional information
available in high-dimensional models. Results of multiple regres-
sion analysis, such as parameter estimates, their standard error
and covariance, have rarely been used in meta-analysis owing to
the complexities underlying the process of their synthesis. In this
context, a method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes has
been proposed in the educational sciences (Becker and Wu,
2007). The method has been recognized to be useful in Genetic
Epidemiology and has been adapted for linear regression 2 df
gene—environment tests in (Manning et al., 2011). The method by
(Becker and Wu, 2007) involves model parameter estimates and
their correlation and provides the overall meta-analytic estimates
of regression slopes together with meta-analysis p—values.

Here, we elaborate the method by (Becker and Wu, 2007) for
multiple logistic regression model. We introduce the analysis
tool METAINTER, which, besides Fisher’s and Stouffer’s
methods, implements the method by (Becker and Wu, 2007)
for an arbitrary number of model parameters. Thereby,
METAINTER enables meta-analysis, for instance, of the
single-marker 2 df association test, global haplotype tests and
tests for and under gene—gene or gene—environment interaction.
The synthesis of regression slopes (Becker and Wu, 2007) relies
on the availability of the covariance matrix of the model param-
eters. Because the covariance matrix is not always provided by
genetic analysis tools, we support the analysis framework
presented here with an update of our own genetic interaction

analysis tool INTERSNP (Herold et al., 2009) to avoid the
potential unavailability of the covariance matrix. We conducted
a simulation study for two-single nucleotide polymorphisms
(SNP) models and evaluated the data with 8 df logistic regression
test under interaction and 4 df logistic regression test for inter-
action. We show that the method for the synthesis of regression
slopes (MSRS) has correct type I error. Moreover, its power is
nearly equal to that of the analysis of the joint sample with cov-
ariate parameters indicating sub-study membership. Furthermore,
we performed a real data analysis of six GWAS of type 2 diabetes
(T2D), available from dbGaP (http: / /www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/ gap).
At ﬁrst, we conducted a genome-wide interaction analysis
(GWIA) with 8 and 4 df logistic regression tests in each study,
and then meta-analyzed the results with METAINTER.

2 METHODS

To model genetic effects of genotypes AA, Aa and cm of a single SNP on
a quantitative trait, a standard linear regression equation y= ,80 + ,8x+
,BDxD is used, where y is the outcome variable, x, xD are two genetic
predictor variables corresponding to the additive and the dominance
effects of a SNP and coded according to the number of copies of the
susceptibility allele A. The coding scheme x= 1,0, —1 and x0 = — 0.5,
0.5, —0.5 is used in our work for the genotypes AA, Aa, cm, respectively
(Cordell and Clayton, 2002). The model parameters ,80, ,8, ,8 D have to be
estimated.

To model genetic effects on a qualitative trait in e. g. case/control
studies, a logistic regression model is used. Let 1) denote the probability
of expressing a phenotype, 0<p< 1. In the logistic regression, the
logarithm of odds logl’fp = : logitp is modeled as logitp= ,80 + ,8x+ IBD
xD with the same predictor variables as before.

The logistic regression model for a single locus can easily be extended
to a two-SNP model. Moreover, it can be modiﬁed for modeling
pair-wise statistical interaction. A full logistic regression model, including
marginal effects and allowing for pair-wise interaction, is represented by

logitP=.30 +51X1+.32x2 +1310XID +1320x2D (1)
+ Vilexz + V1,2Dx1x2D + 100,290sz + V10,2Dx1Dx2D-

This equation models additive x,, and dominance effects xiD, i = 1, 2, of
two SNPs, as well as interaction effects between them. The coding scheme is
as before. The parameters ,8,-, ,8,-D, represent the logarithm of the genotype
relative risks at the locus i, i= 1, 2, whereas ylz, yIJD, leaz, leazD reﬂect
the magnitude of the interaction effects. Testing (1) against the baseline
10 git p = ,80 yields an 8 df test under interaction, i.e. including marginal
effects. Testing (1) against the reduced likelihood logitp = ,80 + ﬁlxl + ,82
x2 + [310x10 + [32sz0 yields a 4 df test for interaction. For more details on
logistic regression models see e.g. (Cordell and Clayton, 2002; Chapman
and Clayton, 2007).

2.1 P-value combination methods

Methods of combining p-values from independent signiﬁcance tests have a
long history, the most popular of them are listed, for instance, in the review
article (Becker, 1994), see also (de Bakker et al., 2010; Zaykin, 201 1). When
raw data cannot be pooled across studies, meta-analysis based on combin-
ation of p-values represents a convenient and feasible approach.

We consider three p-value combination methods. Assume that k studies
(sub-studies of the meta-analysis) were conducted to test a particular
hypothesis H1 versus ﬁxed H0. In two of three methods, the only informa-
tion required to perform meta-analysis is p-values pj of each sub-study
j and possibly sample size 11,-, j = 1, . . . , k. It is well-known that
meta-analysis generally beneﬁts from weighting. Carefully chosen weights

such as, for instance, square root of sample size may improve power of
meta-analysis methods, see (Zaykin, 2011) and references therein.
Fisher’s method (Fisher, 1932). Test statistic of the Fisher’s method has

k
the form T= — 2: log p,- and is xz-distributed under H0 with 2k df.
j=1
Stouffer’s method with weights (Liptak, 1959). A combined p-value is

k
computed as p=1 — d>(Z), with Z=ijd>‘1(l —pj)/
j=1

 

d3 and d3‘1 denote the standard normal cumulative distribution function
and its inverse, and where wj is study-speciﬁc weight, e.g. wj = (ﬁt—J,
j= 1, . . .,k, see (Zaykin, 2011).

Stouffer’s method with weights and effect directions. In case of multiple
regression model, the Stouffer’s method with weights can be modiﬁed to
include the information on the consistency of effect directions across sub-
studies. Assume that the same regression model is used in all sub-studies, and
consider two of them, sub-studies 1 and 2. We assume that a model equation

with p predictor variables is tested versus logit Y= ,80. To compare the
effect directions of two studies we suggest the following ad hoc criter-
ion: two studies are said to have the same effect direction if and

only if the dot product of two vectors [Bu /se(,iA311), . . . , ﬁlp/se(,f31p)] and
[[321 /se(,321),...,,32P/se(,32P)] in the Euclidian space RP is positive.

Here, [31-] are estimates of ,8, with the standard error se(8j,) in sub-study j,
j = 1, 2, l = 1, .. . , P. Our deﬁnition is motivated by the geometrical inter-
pretation of the regression models, where the values of the predictor vari-
ables and the corresponding outcomes are considered to be a cloud of points
in the Euclidian space; for more details see (Pestman, 2009). Note also that
the simulation study below supports the validity of the suggested criterion.
In case, the model equation (2) is tested versus the restricted model logit Y
= ,80 + ,81X 1 + . . . + ,BSXS, 1 5 S < P, one has to address the predictor es-
timates [3,, withj = 1, 2 and 1=s+ 1, . . . , P.
According to the Stouffer’s method with weights and effect directions,
a combined p—value can be found as p= 2(1 — d>(|Z|)), with

 

k
Z: Z 511 qu3_1(1 -Pj/2)/
j=1

where 81-1 = 1, if sub-studies j and 1 have the same direction, and 81-1 = — 1,
otherwise.

2.2 MSRS: method for the synthesis of regression slopes

A new meta-analytic approach based on multivariate generalized
least squares estimation has recently been suggested in (Becker and Wu,
2007) to summarize the results of multiple linear regression used in related
studies. We modiﬁed the method to the case of multiple logistic regression
and applied our modiﬁcation to the meta-analysis of case/control GWAS.

The method in (Becker and Wu, 2007) can brieﬂy be described as
follows. Let k be the number of sub-studies, where the multiple linear
regression model

Y=IBO+IBIX1+...+IBPXP 

was tested versus Y= ,80 to ﬁnd the effect of P predictor variables on
the outcome variable Y. Note that covariates are allowed to be
included. The aim of the meta-analysis is to combine the results of
k sub-studies and to obtain the common estimate of the slope vector
[i=[,81,...,,BP]’. Let [8j1,...,8jp]’ be an estimate vector of [i in
sub-study j, j= 1, . . . , k. The k sub-studies’ estimate vectors are stacked
to a vector b=[311,...,,31P,...,,3k1,...,,3kp]’. The method relies
mutually on the availability of the covariance matrix

Ej =cov([8j1, . . . , [Bl-FY) or at least its estimate 21- in each sub-study j.
Combining k studies, an estimate of the joint covariance matrix 2 has

the form of a block diagonal matrix $2=diag[>‘:1, . . . , 

The slopes estimates are modeled as b = W]! + e, i.e. as a function of [i
and a design matrix W, where the covariance matrix of e has to satisfy the
condition cov(e) = 2. The design matrix W is composed of zeros and ones
that identify which slopes are estimated in each sub-study. In case, when
all sub-studies examine the same set of P predictors, a stack of k identity
matrices of the dimension P x P serves as W.

The generalized least squares approach results in the common
estimates of the slope vector [i and its covariance matrix:

it: [W’i‘IW]_1W’i‘1b,cov(ii)= [WE—WT.

With large samples and under typical regularity conditions
ii~N([i, cov(ii)), and the conﬁdence intervals for each element of [i
are ,3,- iZ1_a/2¢Cﬁ, where Z1_o,/2 is the upper tail 1 —a/2
critical value of the standard normal distribution, C,,- is the ith diagonal
element of cov(ii) matrix, i=1, ...,P. Note that in contrast to the
presentation in (Becker and Wu, 2007), we avoid here the parameter
1%, as it is not relevant for testing in GWAS.

Within the MSRS framework, there are several tests available:

A test of the composite hypothesis [3 = 0 is given by

T=ii’<cov(ii))_lii=ii’<W’i_1W)if,

which is xz-distributed with 1) df.
A test of model ﬁt (or a test of homogeneity of model parameters across
sub-studies):

1311:  =ﬁk1,---,l31p=  =.3kp-
The test statistic is given by

T= (h — wii)’>‘:-1 (b — W3)

and is xz-distributed with (k — 1)P df.

In more general situation, where the model equation (3) is tested versus
the restricted model Y: ,80 +,BIX1+  + ,BSXS in each sub-study,
1 5 S< P, the method can be modiﬁed by including the predictor
slopes ﬁs+1,...,,BP in [3, b, 2 and thus reducing the dimension of W.
Then the test of the composite hypothesis ,8 5+1 = . . . = ,8 P = 0 has (P — S)
df, and the test of model ﬁt 1310;“) =  =,8k(S+1), . . .,,81P=  =,8kP
has (k — 1)(P — S) df.

Note that it is also possible to include in meta-analysis sub-studies that
examine subsets of P predictors. If some sub-studies use fewer than the
full set of P predictors, one can still apply the generalized least squares
approach to integrate the results into the synthesis; see (Becker and
Wu, 2007) for further details.

The method by (Becker and Wu, 2007) can be adjusted to the case
of multiple logistic regression. The only change needed is the proper
estimation of the covariance matrices themselves. The formula for
the estimation of the covariance matrix used for linear regression
model in (Becker and Wu, 2007) ij=(XJ’-Xj)8f is not valid for the
case of logistic regression; here Xj is nj x P matrix with the elements
Xﬁ, being a value of the variable X l in (3) for the ith individual, nj is
the sample size and 82 is an estimate of an error variance in sub-study
j. We applied an estimation of the covariance matrix for multiple lo-
gistic regression models 2]: (XJ’VJ-Xj)‘1 given in O-Iosmer and
Lemeshow, 2000), where Xj is deﬁned analogous to the linear regres-
sion case but for the model equation (2),

Vj =diag[frj1(1— ﬁfjl), . . . , ﬁjnj(1 — ﬁfjnjﬂ,

ft], is the estimated logistic probability computed using the
maximum likelihood estimate [3 and the data for the ith individual

in sub-study j. Modiﬁed MSRS is a powerful method to perform
meta-analysis in case/control GWAS and can be used to summarize
p-values and to obtain the common estimates of model parameters.

3 IMPLEMENTATION

METAINTER is a stand-alone software written in C/C+ +.
It performs meta-analysis of GWAS summary statistics, in par-
ticular those obtained by multiple linear or logistic regression
models. It is assumed that a unique predeﬁned model is used to
analyze the sets of SNP tuples in a series of studies. As input,
multiple regression summary statistics of the parti-cipating studies
have to be provided in tabulated format. METAINTER supports
the output format of the genetic interaction analysis software
INTERSNP (Herold et al., 2009) as well as freely deﬁned
format. Parameters and options of the meta-analysis have to be
speciﬁed in a simple conﬁguration ﬁle.

METAINTER takes care of some technical issues in the
preprocessing of the input data. Suppose that for a C/T SNP
the alleles in input ﬁle are given in the order C/T for sub-study 1,
but given in the order T/C for sub-study 2. In this case, all par-
ameter estimates of log-additive type that depend on the SNP in
the underlying regression model in sub-study 2 will be multiplied
by —1 to unify the reference. The procedure will be repeated
for all SNPs of the tuple under consideration with diverging
reference. In addition, all entries of the covariance matrix
(if available) that depend on log-additive terms of the SNP will
be multiplied by —1. For parameters of entire dominance vari-
ation type, no modiﬁcation is needed. Note that allele reference is
automatically handled by INTERSNP.

METAINTER also attempts to resolve strand ﬂips. If a
SNP is given as C/T polymorphism in sub-study 1, and as
G/A polymorphism in sub-study 2, METAINTER assumes
that C <—>G and T <—>A. If the alleles of sub-study 2 occur in
the order A/G instead, the SNP will in addition undergo the
procedure described in the previous paragraph. C/G polymorph-
ism, of course, will not be ﬂipped by METAINTER. For such
polymorphisms, strand consistency across studies has to be
established before analysis.

4 SIMULATION STUDY

We simulated genotype data for series of 20 000 cases and 20 000
controls and considered a ‘double recessive’ disease model. Let i
and j be the number of susceptibility alleles at SNP 1 and SNP 2,
respectively, 1', j e {0, 1, 2}. For two-SNP genotypes, we speciﬁed
a disease penetrance f22 =0.014 and a baseline penetrance
f,-j= 0.01 for i,j7£2. To create a series of disease models,
we considered all allele frequency distributions {AF1, AF2} with
AF,- 6 {020.3, ...,0.8}, 1': 1,2, and with AF1 5 AF2, the
latter for the reason of symmetry. To investigate the global
null hypothesis, we also considered the situation f22 =0.01.
The results were meta-analyzed by all methods described in
Section 2. For comparison, we analyzed the entire dataset as
well, where covariates indicating sub-study membership were
used. Empirical signiﬁcance level and empirical power level
were computed as the portion of the simulated datasets below
a pre-speciﬁed nominal signiﬁcance level 0:. Under the null hy-
pothesis, we considered a-levels of 0.01, 0.001, 0.0001 and

0.00001. For the power study, we chose a=1 x 10‘”. This is
motivated as follows: under the assumption of n = 1 000 000 in-
dependent SNP sites in the human genome (The Wellcome Trust
Case Control Consortium, 2007), there are n(n — 1) / 2 = 5 x 1011
independent SNP pairs in a GWIA. Dividing 0.05 by 5 x 1011
yields a=1 x 10‘13 as criterion for the experiment-wise
signiﬁcance.

To assess the issue of minimal sample size required to
provide valid inference of the meta-analysis, we also con-
ducted simulation study for 1000, 3000 and 5000 cases and
controls.

5 RESULTS OF THE SIMULATION STUDY

Empirical levels. The results of the simulation study under the
null hypothesis are given for the 8 df logistic regression test in
Supplementary Table S1. In this table, we present the empirical
signiﬁcance levels for the four meta-analysis methods, the joint
sample analysis and the test of homogeneity of model parameters
at two nominal levels: a=0.01 for 10000 simulations and
a=0.00001 for 100 000 simulations. In general, all methods
behave satisfactory under the null hypothesis. We observe
some nominally signiﬁcant excesses of 0:, which is to be
expected because we investigated 336 situations presented in
Supplementary Table S1. Deviation from the nominal level is

assessed by the exact binomial test. For at = 0.01, the most
signiﬁcant difference (p = 0.0002, after Sidak correction with
336 tests poor = 0.0650) is the empirical level 0.0065 obtained by
the test of homogeneity of model parameters for a combination
of allele frequencies 08/08. For a=0.00001, the most signiﬁ-
cant deviation is observed at empirical level of 0.00004.
Note that this excess is still only mildly anti-conservative
(p = 0.02, poor = 1.00). Taking into account multiple comparison
in Supplementary Table S1, we conclude that the methods
perform well in maintaining the nominal signiﬁcance level in
all settings considered. This is also underlined by the fact that
none of the mean empirical levels shows deviation from the
respective nominal level. The simulations under the null hypoth-
esis demonstrate the validity of the meta-analysis methods
implemented in METAINTER.

Power study. Power of all meta-analysis methods considered in
our work and implemented in METAINTER is shown in Table 1
for different combinations of allele frequencies AF 1, AF2, and the
signiﬁcance level 0: =1 x 10‘”. The primary analysis was per-
formed by the 8 and 4 df logistic regression tests. Power of
these tests, used in the joint sample analysis, is given in the last
two columns of the table. Naturally, we see the absence of power
for low allele frequencies and observe the increase of power with
increasing values of allele frequencies, irrespective of the meta-
analysis method used. For almost all settings, the ranking of the
meta-analysis approaches leads to the following priority list with
respect to power: MSRS, the Stouffer’s method with weights and
effect directions, the Stouffer’s method with weights and, ﬁnally,
the Fisher’s method as the least powerful. The most pronounced
divergence in power values between MSRS and the joint sample
analysis is observed for the allele frequency combinations 03/07
and 04/06 for the 8 df test and is rather small in size. From our
study, we can conclude that MSRS outperforms substantially all
other meta-analysis methods in terms of power. Moreover, power
of MSRS is close to that of the analysis of the entire sample.

Furthermore, despite the known problem with low power for
small samples (Supplementary Fig. S1), MSRS provides reason-
able model parameters estimates. In particular, as shown in
Table 2, the correlation between meta-analysis estimates and
estimates obtained from the joint sample analysis with the 8 df
logistic regression test, as computed for AF1=AF2=0.3 and
based on 100 permutation replicates, is >0.93, indicating the val-
idity of the method even for reasonable sample sizes. These facts
demonstrate the usefulness of the information contained in the
covariance matrix of model parameters.

In case the covariance matrix is not available and MSRS can
not be applied, the Stouffer’s method with weights and effect
directions represents an effective alternative to perform

meta-analysis. We notice the beneﬁt from differentiating the
consistency of effect directions in sub-studies participating in
meta-analysis. It results in higher power of the Stouffer’s
method with effect directions in comparison with the Stouffer’s
method where the effect directions are neglected.

6 REAL DATA ANALYSIS

We investigated six GWAS datasets of T2D that are available
from dbGaP (Mailman et al., 2007), cf. Table 3 and relied on the
quality controlled data available there.

Primary analysis of six T2D GWAS was performed by the 8 df
logistic regression test under interaction and by the 4 df logistic
regression test for interaction. We use both regression models to
give examples of the applicability of the meta-analysis approach.

Summary statistics of single-marker GWAS can typically be
integrated in one-step meta-analysis. To meta-analyze the results
of two-marker GWAS, however, a two-stage procedure is neces-
sary to guarantee computational feasibility. A GWIA involves a
large number of SNP pairs (1010—1012). This implies that (i) for
running time reasons a fast screening test has to be used in the
initial GWIA in all participating studies; (ii) not all results of this
GWIA can be stored for lack of hard-disk memory. Therefore,
we applied the following two-stage design. In stage I, we con-
ducted a GWIA on all SNP pairs in each study with the 8 df and
4 df logistic regression tests; we did not use any covariates at this
stage. In this case, the test statistic can be obtained in closed form
(Marchini et al., 2005), and running time depends on
how quickly two-SNP genotypes can be counted in cases and
controls. The implementation of the Hamming weight method
WVegner, 1960) in INTERSNP (Herold et al., 2012) allowed
us to test all SNP pairs from each study, with maximum of
4.22 x 1011 pairs in the second T2D study. It was analyzed
by INTERSNP within ~16h on a dedicated computing node
(3 GHz) and required 2 GB working memory. From the stage

I analysis, we retained a list of candidate SNP pairs
with p-valuef 1 x 10‘4 in at least one study. After stage I,
we merged the candidate lists obtained from each study to
form a ‘joint’ list. In stage II, the joint list was sent back
to each study and analyzed with INTERSNP by the 8 and 4
df logistic regression tests. To adjust for potential population
stratiﬁcation, we performed multidimensional scaling as imple-
mented in (Purcell et al., 2007) for each study and retained 3
leading dimensions as covariate parameters for the analysis.
After stage II, summary statistics from 2149025 (8 df) and
2950 354 (4 df) candidate SNP pairs were available in all six
T2D studies and were meta-analyzed with METAINTER.
The meta-analysis took METAINTER 23 min (8 (if) and
11min (4 df).

In Table 4, the top ﬁve results of the meta-analysis of six T2D
GWAS are shown for both logistic regression tests. In Table 5,
three further experiment-wide signiﬁcant results are given with
the indication which test they refer to. In these tables we present
the p—values of six individual studies, the p—values of the meta-
analysis performed by four methods implemented in
METAINTER and the p—values of the test of homogeneity of
model parameters across studies; see Section 2.2.

All top SNP pairs for the 8 df logistic regression test contain
SNP rs7901695, located within the T CF 7L2 gene. This gene is
known to harbor the most important genetic risk factor for T2D,
as identiﬁed by GWAS (Ali, 2013). Because the 8 df test includes
marginal SNP effects, the accumulation of rs7901695 in the top
ranking results corroborates the validity and utility of our ana-
lysis. The strongest association signals are seen for MSRS
method, which coincides with the results of the power study.

Among the top ﬁve results for the 8 df logistic regression test,
the second SNP of each pair is not located in regions previously
implicated in T2D. However, those SNPs can be viewed as can-
didates for either marginal association or potential interaction
with rs7901695.

Table 5 presents two experiment-wide signiﬁcant SNP pairs
for the 8 df logistic regression test. Each pair contains a further
SNP previously implicated in T2D. The SNP rs12195232, located
20 kb upstream of SA YSDI gene, has been suggested as a T2D
risk factor by the standard single SNP analysis in (Cho et al.,
2011). Another SNP, rs10012946, is located in the WFSI
gene. Mutations in this gene are associated with Wolfram
syndrome, also called DIDMOAD (diabetes insipidus, diabetes
mellitus, optic atrophy and deafness). WFSI was also found to
be associated with T2D Woight et al., 2010). The presence of
rs12195232 and rs10012946 in experiment-wide signiﬁcant
pairs demonstrates the potential of multiple regression models
in general. In single-marker analysis, both SNPs would have
gone undetected with the data that were available to
us (p = 0.023 and p = 0.012, respectively). However, in the
multiple regression meta-analysis, these SNPs come into focus,
while analyzing six comparatively small T2D GWAS.
Hence, investigation of interaction between SA YSDI and
T CF7L2, WFSI and T CF 7L2 and the marginal effects of both
SA YSDI and WFSI in larger studies would be of interest.

In Table 4, among the top ﬁve results of the T2D meta-analysis
for the 4 df logistic regression test, none of the SNP pairs reached a
genome-wide signiﬁcant p-value. However, SNP pair rs6446498/
rs12109266 (rank No. 9), listed in Table 5, represents a plausible

candidate. Rs6446498 is located in PPP2R2C gene, previously
shown to be associated with T2D (Rung et al., 2009).
Rs12109266 located near LOC101928448 gene, which was
reported to be associated with body fat distribution using waste
circumference in male individuals of African ancestry (Liu et al.,
2013a). Moreover, in (Zheng et al., 2013) it was shown that
LOC101928448 interacts with two environmental factors: carbo-
hydrate for fasting insulin and homeostasis model assessment of
insulin resistance, making signiﬁcant contribution to the genotype
by environment variance for T2D-related traits. Because the ﬁrst
SNP of the pair rs6446498/rs12109266 is already known as a T2D
risk variant, one can argue that the signiﬁcance threshold of
1 x 10‘13 for entirely new pairs is not required here, and that
5 x 10‘8 is an appropriate threshold for a test for interaction
with a known SNP. In this sense, the pair is signiﬁcant after
adjustment for multiple testing. Replication in independent
datasets is nevertheless warranted.

The p—values pH of the test of homogeneity of model param-
eters across six T2D GWAS, computed for the predictor slopes
only (omitting intercepts), are shown in the last column of
Tables 4 and 5. The p—values p H provide evidence of homogeneity
for almost all SNP pairs except for rs1834134/rs7901695
(p H = 0.046).

The meta-analysis by MSRS allows us to estimate not only
p-values but effect sizes as well. Table 6 presents the slopes
estimates for the 8 df logistic regression model from each
of the six T2D GWAS, and shows meta-analysis estimates
obtained by MSRS for one SNP pair listed in Table 5. By
applying MSRS we are provided with an overall model
based on the synthesis of the results in the primary studies,

where the interrelationships among predictors are accounted
for. For comparison, we included in Table 6 the slopes estimates
obtained from the joint sample analysis (‘mega-analysis’), see
‘JointS’ row. The estimates of both approaches are in good
concordance.

7 DISCUSSION

New methods to meta-analyze genetic data are obviously of
growing demand (Evangelou and Ioannidis, 2013). Meta-analysis
of summary statistics of single-marker tests applied in GWAS is
an established standard, which however needs to be extended to
more complex multiple parameter testing strategies. In context of
rare variant analysis, which typically addresses multiple param-
eters from a genomic region, an important improvement of
p—values combination methods has recently been made by
(Liu et al., 2013b). The method presented there is based on the
correlation structure of single-variant test statistics, and, in terms
of power, comes close to power of the rare variant analysis of the
combined sample.

The method for the synthesis of linear regression slopes
(Becker and Wu, 2007) has been applied to meta-analyze the
results of a linear regression gene—environment interaction test
(Manning et al., 2011). Here, we presented a general framework
that enables application of MSRS to meta-analysis of both linear
and logistic multiple regression models. In addition, a test that
assesses across-study heterogeneity can easily be formulated
within MSRS framework and is a part of our implementation.
The method can be used to ﬁlter out signals that are driven by

just a few studies alone, thereby it captures the main advantage
of random effects models.

Via application to six T2D GWAS, we could demonstrate
that the implementation of MSRS in METAINTER
allows efﬁcient computation. Meta-analysis of 2.2 million SNP
pairs analyzed in six studies took METAINTER 23 min.
We supported the analysis by updating our INTERSNP tool
(Herold et al., 2009, 2012). INTERSNP provides now the
necessary covariance matrix of parameter estimates in multiple
regression models.

The implementation of MSRS in METAINTER allows
efﬁcient meta-analysis for multiple linear and logistic regression
models. However, the method should be used with caution,
if the evidence of strong dependence between predictor variables
exists. The phenomenon of multicollinearity can manifest itself,
for example, when the inverse covariance matrix has to be com-
puted. If the model is well speciﬁed in each sub-study, there should
be no strong multicollinearity. Otherwise model reduction can be
useful to get around this problem. For GWAS with small samples
and for SNPs with low allele frequencies (e.g. both <0.2 or for one
SNP <0.05) a test with fewer parameters, for instance, 3 df allelic
test under interaction, might be a reasonable choice. MSRS as-
sumes that the multicollinearity issue was checked in sub-studies
and that any of them is relatively free from this problem. If the
covariance matrix is non-invertible for a particular SNP pair (or
SNP, or SNP set) in a sub-study, METAINTER will exclude the
sub-study from the meta-analysis for the respective pair.

MSRS is an appropriate generalization of the existing techniques
in the following sense: in case of one parameter models, the method
is equivalent to the ﬁxed effect model, and in the multiple param-
eter case its power comes close to that of the analysis of the joint
sample, as we have shown in our simulation study. Moreover,
power comparison of MSRS with the Fisher’s and the Stouffer’s
methods re-emphasizes the importance of going beyond p—value-
based meta-analysis for higher-dimensional models.

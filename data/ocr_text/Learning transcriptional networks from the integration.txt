ABSTRACT

Results: We have developed LeTlCE (Learning Transcriptional
networks from the Integration of ChlP—chip and Expression data),
an algorithm for learning a transcriptional network from ChlP—chip
and expression data. The network is specified by a binary matrix
of transcription factor (T F)—gene interactions partitioning genes into
modules and a background of genes that are not involved in the
transcriptional regulation. We define a likelihood of a network, and
then search for the network optimizing the likelihood.

We applied LeTlCE to the location and expression data from
yeast cells grown in rich media to learn the transcriptional network
specific to the yeast cell cycle. It found 12 condition-specific TFs
and 15 modules each of which is highly represented with functions
related to particular phases of cell-cycle regulation.

1 INTRODUCTION

The process of transcription, whereby an RNA product is produced
from the DNA, is an important control point for regulating the
activity of genes and their protein products in particular cell types
or in response to a particular signal. The ‘circuit diagram’ of
this transcriptional control process in which many transcription
factors (TFs) act simultaneously and interactively to control the
transcription of many genes is called a transcriptional regulatory
network (TRN).

Learning a TRN from data is intrinsically difﬁcult since most
of the available data are highly condition dependent. Therefore,
using data obtained from a speciﬁc condition or experiment can
reveal only limited parts of the network which are active in that
speciﬁc condition. As a way of inferring and understanding aspects
of a transcriptional network, previous researchers (B ar—Joseph et al.,
2003; Lemmens et al., 2006; Segal et al., 2003b) introduced the
concept of ‘modules’. Though the exact deﬁnition of a module varies
between papers; in general, a module is a set of genes sharing a
common set of regulating TFs.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

The earliest attempts to learn a TRN began with an introduction of
expression data since these data provide a global view of expression
levels of thousands of genes at a time. Friedman et al. (2000) and
Segal et al. (2003b) tried to learn a TRN using the assumption that the
expression levels of genes depend on the expression levels of the TFs
regulating those genes. A fundamental limitation of this approach is
that expression data only measure the mRNA abundances, while
it is the TF proteins that are directly involved in the regulation
of genes. Therefore, the mRNA levels of the TFs may not be
highly correlated with those of the genes they regulate. Second, high
correlation of expression levels only provides indirect evidence for
the transcriptional hierarchy of the corresponding gene regulation.
For example, two genes, A and B, may be highly correlated because
(i) A regulates B or (ii) B regulates A, or (iii) both are regulated by
a third gene C. These three cases may not be easily distinguished
using microarray data alone.

Due to these intrinsic limitations of expression data for learning
TRNs, it is important to integrate other available information, such as
ChIP—chip location data or DNA motif data. Location data often are
presented as a matrix of P—values, with rows corresponding to genes
and columns corresponding to TFs. For each TF j and gene 1’, the
corresponding element of the matrix is the P—value for the hypothesis
that there exists no interaction between TF j and the promoter region
of gene i. Therefore, location data provide direct evidence for the
relation between TFs and the genes they regulate by identifying
physical interactions between TFs and DNA regions. However,
location data also have limitations since this physical interaction
may indicate binding but not function (Bar—Joseph et al., 2003).
Also, location data are highly condition dependent and difﬁcult to
obtain.

Another widely used data type are motif data that provide
information about which potential TF binding sites exist in the
promoter region of a gene. Motif data provide less direct evidence
for the relation between TFs and genes than location data because
motifs are merely potential binding sites which may not be bound
by TFs. For this reason, we do not use motif data in our algorithm.

Because location, motif and expression data provide
complementary information, many researchers have proposed
methods for modeling a TRN by integrating these data types. In
general, they have taken either a regression approach or a clustering
approach. The regression approach taken by Bonneau et al. (2006),
Chen et al. (2007), Gao et al. (2004) and Liao et al. (2003) is based
on the rather strong assumption that the expression levels of TFs
are correlated with the expression levels of the genes they regulate.
The clustering approach followed by Bar—Joseph et al. (2003),

Brynildsen et al. (2006), Lemmens et al. (2006), Liu et al. (2007)
and Segal et al. (2003a) is based on the weaker assumption that
expression levels of genes regulated by the same TFs are correlated.

Of the algorithms that use the clustering approach, the most
widely cited are the GRAM algorithm (Bar—Joseph et al.,
2003) and the ReModiscovery algorithm (Lemmens et al.,
2006). GRAM integrates location and expression data, whereas
ReModiscovery integrates location, expression and motif data to
learn transcriptional modules. However, they share a common
structure. They threshold P—value matrices representing location
data and (for ReModiscovery) score matrices representing motif
data with single cutoffs 16 and tm, respectively. Then they seed
the procedure by detecting modules of tightly coexpressed genes
that share common subsets of TFs and motifs that exceed these
thresholds. Finally, they relax the thresholds and add additional
genes whose expression patterns are similar to the core expression
proﬁle of the modules.

We have developed an algorithm, which we call LeTICE
(Learning Transcriptional networks from the Integration of ChIP—
chip and Expression data). It follows the clustering approach
like GRAM and ReMoDiscovery. However, it differs from these
algorithms in signiﬁcant ways.

First, LeTICE deﬁnes a probabilistic model that integrates the
location and expression data and ﬁts this model by maximizing its
likelihood. As a result, it simultaneously generates all modules using
the entire set of TFs, and thus can identify combinatorial interactions
between TFs. Most other algorithms use subsets of TFs and a P—value
cutoff to build modules sequentially and then use expression data
to measure the quality of each module and to adjust it. Thus, there
is an asymmetry in integrating the two sources of data for those
algorithms.

Second, LeTICE uses a non—parametric probabilistic model
for the expression data, and therefore does not impose any
assumptions about the distribution such as the often violated
normality assumption.

Finally, LeTICE identiﬁes condition speciﬁc TFs, i.e. TFs that
are active in regulating genes in a given condition. Finding such
condition—speciﬁc TFs is important, but it is hard to do so simply
by analyzing expression data or location data separately. Many
TFs actively regulating genes show constant expression proﬁles,
and therefore identifying condition—speciﬁc TFs by variation in
expression levels can result in many false negatives. Finding
condition— speciﬁc TFs using only location data is not effective either.
If a TF does not regulate any genes then the P—values for the TF
are uniformly distributed between 0 and 1. Therefore, choosing
condition—speciﬁc TFs using a P—value threshold can result in many
false positives. By properly integrating expression and location
data, LeTICE is able to model TF bindings and identify the genes
regulated by these TFs on a condition—speciﬁc basis.

2 METHODS

2.1 Overview of the algorithm

We represent the TRN as a binary matrix B with rows representing genes and
columns representing TFs, where Bl‘j = 1 if TF j regulates gene i and Bl‘j =0
otherwise.

Figure 1 shows an overview of the algorithm. The matrix B in the center
is the binding matrix that we want to determine. For that, we deﬁne the
likelihood P(B |L, E) of B given the location data L and the expression data E.

Fig. 1. Overview of the LeTlCE algorithm. The matrix B in the center is
the binding matrix that we want to determine. The left matrix L is a matrix
of binding probabilities between TFs (columns) and genes (rows). From this
matrix, we obtain P(BlL), the likelihood of B given L. The matrix B partitions
genes into modules and the background. The rows (genes) in the matrix B
with the same color belong to the same module or background. Here, red and
green rows form modules and yellow rows form a background. The box to
the right shows expression proﬁles of genes, each of which are colored as in
the matrix B. From this, we obtain P(E |B), the likelihood of the expression
proﬁles E given the binding matrix B.

According to Bayes rule, P(BlL,E) ~P(B|L) -P(E|B,L)=P(B|L) -P(E|B)
since we assume that the likelihood of the expression data is independent of
the location data once the binary matrix B is known.

We assume that genes either belong to modules or the background. We
deﬁne a module to be a set of genes that are regulated by the same set
of TFs and have similar expression proﬁles. We deﬁne the background as
a set of genes that are not regulated by any of the investigated TFs and
which do not need to show similar expression proﬁles. The i—th module M,-
has to have a unique binding pattern 19,-, which is determined to maximize
P(Bk = bi, k e M ,- lL), where Bk is the k—th row of the binding matrix B (binding
pattern of the gene k). Also, its gene members should have similar expression
proﬁles that is measured by the density P(EMi |B), where EMi is the expression
data for genes belonging to module Mi.

Therefore, the binding matrix B can only exist in the form that generates
a set of modules M,- satisfying the above condition and the background M0
with its binding pattern 190 =0.

We deﬁne P(BlL) as the product of binomial probabilities for bindings
between every TF and gene: P(BlL): Hiangijﬂ —L,-j)1_BiJ', where Li]- 2
P(Bl‘j: 1). We assumed independence of individual binding events. This
is only an approximation to the truth, which is necessary since there are
insufﬁcient data to estimate the dependency structure among the TF bindings.
The binding probabilities Li]- can be obtained by converting P—values, the
original form of location data (Chen et al., 2007). The process of converting
P—values to binding probabilities is explained in the Supplementary Material.

We deﬁne the likelihood P(E |B) of expression proﬁles for a set of modules
and the background to measure the compactness of the expression proﬁles
of the modules. For that, we use the likelihood of expression proﬁles under a
mixture model. We assume expression proﬁles of genes in the same module
or background are generated from the same density. The difﬁculty in choosing
the density estimate for the mixture components arises because modules and
a background have very different distributions. To ﬁt two very different kinds
of distributions equally well, we chose a kernel density estimate since kernel
density estimates do not require any assumptions about the distribution of the
data, and therefore are very ﬂexible. The detailed description of the likelihood
P(ElB) is provided in Section 2.2.

In summary, the binding matrix B which generates a set of modules and
background has the likelihood P(BlL,E)~P(B|L).P(E|B), where P(BlL)
measures how likely genes in modules or background have the same binding
pattern and P(E |B) measures how similar the expression proﬁles of genes in

each module are. Using numerical optimization, LeT ICE ﬁnds the binding
matrix B which maximizes P(BlL)-P(ElB). The optimization process is
described in Section 2.4.

2.2 Deﬁning the likelihood for a set of modules and a
background

A given binary binding matrix B results in a partition of genes into modules
and a background. We deﬁne modules as subsets of size at least ﬁve regulated
by at least one TF, whose members have similar expression proﬁles. To
measure the compactness of modules, we use the likelihood of expression
proﬁles under a mixture model. Let fk(E,- |B) be the estimated density for the
expression proﬁles of the i—th gene in the k—th module or the background
if k=0. Then, the likelihood P(ElB) of expression data given the binding

matrix is
G(B)

P(ElB): H karEl-IB). (1)
k=0ieMk
where G(B) is the total number of modules generated by the binary matrix
B, Mk is the set of indices of genes belonging to the k—th component, and E,-
is the expression proﬁle of the i—th gene.

When we estimate the density of the i—th gene, fk(E,- |B), we leave out the
i—th gene. That is, the density of the i—th gene is estimated from other genes
belonging to the same subset. If we include the expression level of the gene
itself when estimating its density, genes belonging to small subsets will get
higher density due to overﬁtting.

A key issue is the choice of density estimate for the mixture components
fk. We can use either a parametric or a non—parametric estimate. If we use
a parametric estimate, we need to make a strong assumption about the
distribution of the data. A Gaussian density may be a reasonable model
for the expression proﬁles of genes in a module. However, the assumption
of a Gaussian distribution does not make much sense for the greater number
of genes belonging to the background. We could use a different parametric
model for the background, but using different models may induce a bias
in the assignment of genes to modules or background. If the model for the
background is too inﬂexible to ﬁt the data, then the optimization process
will ﬁnd a binary matrix B generating a set of modules such that the size
of the background is small. On the other hand, if the background model ﬁts
the data too well, the process will ﬁnd a binary matrix such that the size of
the background is large. To avoid this kind of bias, we want to use the same
type of model for both background and modules. This model needs to be
ﬂexible enough to ﬁt two very different kinds of distributions. Therefore, we
use kernel density estimates to model the distributions of expression levels
for modules and a background, leading to a likelihood that is similar to the
criterion for kernel k—means clustering (Dhillon et 01., 2004).

2.2.1 Kernel density estimates We standardize expression proﬁles of all
genes to have mean 0 and length 1. Therefore, expression proﬁles are points
on the unit sphere in N dimensions, where N is the length of an expression
proﬁle. The distance between points x and y on the sphere is represented by
an angle xTy, which is same with a Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between
two points.

Let X1, ' ' X” be points on the sphere assumed to be generated from some
unknown density. A kernel density estimate at a point x on the sphere is
deﬁned as

A 1 ”
f (x; K) = ZCO(K);K(KXTX1')7

where K is a smoothing parameter and 00(K) is a normalizing constant (Hall
et 01., 1987). The most commonly used kernel is K (t)=et . Since xTXl- is
the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient between x and X), the density at x is an
increasing function of the correlation between x and the other members of
the subset.

The smoothing parameter K controls the smoothness of the estimate; the
smaller K, the smoother the estimate. An important issue in kernel density
estimation is the choice of smoothing parameter K. To avoid bias when

assigning genes to modules or background, we use the same smoothing
parameter for all the mixture components. Estimating a smoothing parameter
for density estimates in high—dimensional data is a challenging problem for
which no good solution is known. We ﬁrst tried to ﬁnd K that maximizes
the total likelihood. However, this resulted in a very large value of K and
essentially no smoothing. Therefore, we use a heuristic for determining K,
we choose K such that on average 90% of the sum of kernel values for
each gene is contributed by m: 10 other genes. In our simulation study
(Supplementary Material), we tried several values for m on simulated data
and found that m =10 gave the best result.

2.3 Pre-selecting transcriptionally active genes and TFs

Screening out genes and TFs that do not appear to be part of the condition—
speciﬁc network under study reduces the the number of parameters to be
estimated by the algorithm and their variability. Brynildsen et al. (2006) also
suggested that due to the high degree of inconsistency between expression
and location data, it is necessary to select genes whose expression and
location data are mutually consistent. Of course, the beneﬁts of pre—selection
come at a cost—we may occasionally miss relevant genes and TFs because
they do not meet the selection criteria.

2.3.] Gene selection We expect that genes that are part of condition—
speciﬁc networks show variation in their expression patterns. Therefore, We
exclude genes with constant expression levels from further consideration.
There are various statistical methods available to identify genes that are
differentially expressed over time or experiments (Simon and Lam, 2006;
Storey et 01., 2005). For the speciﬁc case of cell—cycle data, there are
statistics measuring the periodicity of expression levels (Orlando et 01., 2008;
Spellman et 01., 1998). If the purpose of the analysis is to ﬁnd the TRN
controlling the cell—cycle network, these measures may be more appropriate
than omnibus measures since cell—cycle genes show periodic expression
patterns.

2.3.2 TF selection TFs whose bindings affect the transcription of the
genes are considered to be transcriptionally active. Some TFs bind to the
upstream regions of genes without affecting transcription of those genes. For
these TFs, their binding patterns are independent of the correlation patterns
of expression levels of genes and we ﬁlter out these TFs.

For a TF to regulate expression of some genes, the TF must ﬁrst bind those
genes, and thus binding probabilities between the TF and the regulated genes
should be large. Therefore, a group  ={i|P(B,-j=1|L)>0.5} will contain
most of the genes regulated by TF j. The genes regulated by TF j will belong
to some modules, thus some pairs of those genes will have high correlations.
Therefore, if a TF j regulates expression of some genes, there will be highly
correlated pairs of genes within the group Cj. In other words, the set of
correlations between genes in Cj will contain a higher proportion of large
values compared to the set of correlations of randomly chosen genes.

We calculate the 95th percentile ,0 of the Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcients
between all pairs of genes. We then calculate the proportion of correlations
higher than ,0 in the set of correlation coefﬁcients between genes in Cj and
deﬁne a non—parametric P—value pj by comparing it with the proportions of
correlations higher than ,0 from a random group with same size as Cj.

If pj is small, then the proportion of large correlations between genes
in Cj is signiﬁcantly higher than the proportion in random groups, and we
conclude that TF j regulates some genes. We validate the performance of this
TF pre—selection step in our simulation study (see Supplementary Material).

After TF pre—selection, we remove all genes that have low binding
probabilities (<0.l) for all the pre—selected TFs, since they will probably
be assigned to the background by the optimization process. By removing
these genes in advance, we reduce the background size.

2.4 Optimization of the objective function

Our goal is to ﬁnd a binding matrix B, which maximizes the likelihood
P(BlE,L). This is a combinatorial optimization problem, and ﬁnding a

global optimum is impossible. Our optimization algorithm consists of three
stages: initialization, randomized greedy ascent and post—processing. Post—
processing is deterministic, but the local optimum found by randomized
greedy ascent depends on the initial number N of modules and their initial
binding patterns, and the steps that happen to be chosen in the ascent. We run
the entire algorithm repeatedly (1000 times) for different values of N and
report the best solution. A detailed description of the optimization process is
provided in the Supplementary Material.

We use the cell—cycle expression data of Cho et al. (1998),
Orlando et al. (2008) and Spellman et al. (1998): two replicate
series from Orlando et al. (2008) obtained using elutriation, one
series from Spellman et al. (1998) obtained using arrest of alpha
factor and one series from Cho et al. (1998) obtained using
cdc28 temperature—sensitive mutant. They were all obtained in
rich media. We use 510 genes that are selected to have periodic
expression patterns by the periodicity measures of both Orlando
et al. (2008) and Spellman et al. (1998). We calculated P(Ei |B)
separately for each subseries i and multiplied them together to
obtain the total likelihood P(E |B).

0 Location data :
We use the data from Lee et al. (2002) obtained for yeast cells
grown in a rich medium. They provide P—values for testing
binding between 113 TFs and 6270 genes.

3.1.2 Cell-cycle TRN The TRN found by LeTICE is shown in
Figure 2. Rectangles represent gene modules and circles represent
TFs. LeTICE found 12 condition—speciﬁc TFs out of 113 TFs :ACE2,
FKH2, GAT3, HIRl, HIR2, MBPl, MCMl, NDDl, SW14, SW15,
SW16 and YAP5. These include TFs that are well known to play
key roles in cell—cycle regulation: ACE2, FKH2, MBP1, MCM1,
NDDl, SW14, SW15 and SW16. We assign a unique integer to each
module and the size of rectangles represent the size of modules.
Modules with global GO P—value (which will be explained later
in this chapter) less than 0.05 have bold border lines. There are
15 modules containing 5, 6, 7, 7, 9, 9, 12, 13, 13, 14, 14, 15, 19, 19
and 23 genes, respectively, for a total of 185 genes.

There are two different types of edges : arrowed and dotted.
An arrowed edge between a TF and a module means that the TF
regulates the genes belonging to the module, whereas a dotted
edge means that the TF itself belongs to the module. For each
arrowed edge linking a TF to a module, we calculated the non—
parametric P—value for the correlation between the TF and the mean
expression level of the module by comparing it with correlations
between all 113 TFs and the mean expression levels of all the
modules (Bar—Joseph et al., 2003). The P—value for the correlation
is the fraction of all the correlations whose absolute value is
larger than the absolute value of the correlation associated with the
edge in question. Edges between a TF and a gene module whose
correlation is positive with P<0.05 are colored blue and edges
whose correlation is negative with P<0.05 are colored red. The
other edges are colored black. As mentioned in Section 1, LeTICE
does not use the assumption that the expression levels of the TFs

Fig. 2. Graph of TRN built by LeT ICE. Rectangles represent gene modules
and circles represent TFs. Each gene module is given a unique integer and
the gene modules having GO P < 0.05 have thick black border lines. There is
an arrowed edge between a TF and a gene module if the TF binds the genes
in the module, whereas there is a dotted edge if the TF itself belongs to the
module. The arrowed edges are colored according to the correlation between
expression levels of a TF and genes: if signiﬁcantly positive, blue colored, if
negative, red colored. The other edges are black colored. Each module and
TF is colored according to the cell—cycle phase (G1, G2/M, M/Gl, S and
S/G2) they belong to.

and their regulated genes are correlated since this assumption fails
for many TFs as we can see in Figure 2. There are many black edges
in Figure 2 and if we used the assumption, these edges could not be
detected.

Spellman et al. (1998) classiﬁed genes involved in the cell cycle
into the ﬁve phase groups G1, G2/M, M/Gl, S and S/G2 according
to their times of peak expression. We used the classiﬁcation of
Spellman et al. (1998) to assign each module and TF to the most
represented phases of the set of genes belonging to the same module,
or those regulated by the same TF, respectively. We also obtain P—
values of the phases by measuring how frequently the phase appears
in the set compared to the entire set of genes using hypergeometric
distribution. All modules and TFs detected by LeTI CE are assigned
to phases with P<0.05 and they are colored according to their
assigned phases in Figure 2.

By assigning each TF to a phase according to the phases of their
regulated genes, we make two interesting observations. First, the
phase assigned by the phases of its regulated genes and the phase by
its time of peak expression from Spellman et al. (1998) are different
for every TF. While all the condition—speciﬁc TFs were assigned
to a phase according to the phases of their regulated genes, many
of them were not assigned to any phases according to their times
of peak expression by Spellman et al. (1998) due to their constant
expression levels. Of the 12 condition—speciﬁc TFs, only 5 TFs were
assigned to phases by their times of peak expression: ACE2 to G2/M,
GAT3 to M/Gl, NDDl to G1, SW14 to M/Gl and SW15 to G2/M,
whereas ACE2 was assigned to G1, GAT3 to G1, NDDl to G2/M,
SW14 to G1 and SW15 to M/Gl by the phases of the regulated
genes. This implies that there are various time lags between the
times of peak expression of TFs and the times of peak expression of
their regulated genes. Again, this observation calls in question the

Second, all TFs regulate genes belonging to either the same phase
or to adjacent phases.

The complete list of genes, which belongs to each module and of
TFs regulating each module, and detailed description of the modules
are provided in the Supplementary Material.

3.1.3 Extraction and interpretation of the TF sabnetwork As
shown in Figure 2, some TFs regulate other TFs which control
transcription in the next phase of the cell cycle. From Figure 2,
we generated the TF network in Figure 3A consisting only of TFs
by ﬁrst deleting all genes, which are not condition—speciﬁc TFs and
then deleting isolated TFs. It contains TFs MBP1, SWI4/5/6, NDD1,
MCM1, FKH2 and ACE2, all known to play key roles in regulating
the cell cycle. It is almost identical to the previously suggested
cell—cycle transcriptional network (Simon et al., 2001), which is
interesting because it was generated de novo using all 113 TFs,
whereas the previously suggested TF network was constructed using
the location data of only nine known cell—cycle regulatory TFs.
This implies that on the transcriptional level, this small TF network
controls the whole cell—cycle regulatory network.

The G1—speciﬁc TF complexes SWI4/SWI6/MBP1 regulate the
G2/M—speciﬁc TF NDD1. NDD1 is a limiting component of the
complex MCM1/FKH2/NDD1 that regulates M/Gl—speciﬁc TFs
SW15 and ACE2. This serial regulation of TFs is linear rather than
cyclic. Cyclic regulation of TFs is achieved by cyclin—dependent
kinases (CDKs), which bind with cyclins to be activated.

To better understand the cyclic ﬂow in the network, we added
cyclins and CDK inhibitors which LeTI CE found to be regulated by
the TFs in Figure 3A to generate Figure 3B.

In yeast, the cell cycle is regulated by two CDKs, CDC28 and
PHO85. CDC28 associates with cyclins CLN1/2 and CLB2/5/6 and
PHO85 associates with cyclins PCL1/2/9.

It is known that CDC28 associated with CLN3 and PHO85
associated with PCL9 phosphorylate the repressor of SBF (the pair
of SW14 and SW16) and MBF (the pair of SW16 and MBP1) to
promote its dissociation from SBF and MBF (Huang et al., 2009).

SBF and MBF then start transcription of G1/ S cyclins CLNl/CLN2,
which in turn associate with CDC28 to further phosphorylate the
repressor of SBF and MBF leading to its complete dissociation from
SBF and MBF, forming a positive feedback loop. PCLl, regulated
by SBF and MBF and PCL2, regulated by ACE2 are known to
have redundant function with CLNl and CLN2. SBF and MBF
also activate CLB5/CLB6, which associate with CDC28 to play
important roles for entry into and progression through the S phase.

NDD1 activated by SBF and MBF combine with MCM1 to
activate CLB2, which inactivates SBF and MBF, helping to end
the G1/S program and start the G2/M program (Amon et al., 1993;
Spellman et al., 1998).

The TF SW15 regulated by MCM1, NDD1 and FKH2 transcribes
SICl and PCL9. Expression of SICl helps to inactivate CLB2
activity, helping to simultaneously end the M phase and the
repression of the G1/S phase. PCL9—PHO85 and CLN3—CDC28
activate SBF and MBF, starting a new round of cell cycle (Futcher,
2002).

We compared the network in Figure 3B with the one built by
Simon et al. (2001) using the location data of nine cell—cycle
TFs. The biggest difference between the two networks is that our
network does not contain the TF FKH1. FKH1 was not selected as
a condition—speciﬁc TF by LeTI CE because the genes regulated by
FKH1 do not show high correlation with each other. Also, FKH1 do
not have high binding probabilities with any condition—speciﬁc TFs.

In addition to that, the cyclin CLB 1/CLN3 and the CDK inhibitor
FARl were not assigned to any TFs. It is not surprising that
CLBl and FARl were not assigned to any TFs since their binding
probabilities to any condition—speciﬁc TFs are very low (at most
0.01 for CLBl and 0.27 for FARl). The cyclin CLN3 has a high
binding probability to one TF, MCM1 (0.99), but the correlation
of the expression pattern of CLN3 with other genes regulated by
MCM1 is not high. In fact, this irregular pattern of CLN3 was also
pointed out by Wittenberg et al. (1990) and Tyers et al. (1992) who
show that although CLNl and CLN2 are periodically transcribed
with a peak at the late G1, CLN3 is expressed throughout the cell
cycle and shows less ﬂuctuation in mRNA and protein levels.

3.2 Validation with Gene Ontology annotation

We want to validate the TRN which LeTICE found. However, the
ground truth about the network is not known. As a substitute, we
measure the internal homogeneity of modules with respect to Gene
Ontology (GO) annotation. For this purpose, we use the GO induced
similarity from the Bioconductor function SimUI within biological
process ontology (Wolting et al., 2006).

SimUI uses the graph induced by GO terms associated with each
gene to calculate the similarity between any pair of genes. It is the
number of nodes that the two graphs have in common divided by
the number of nodes in the union of the two graphs. Hence the
similarities are bounded between 0 and 1 and more similar gene
pairs have values closer to one (Wolting et al. (2006)).

For each module, we calculate the mean of GO similarities
between all pairs of genes in the module. Then, we calculate the
non—parametric P—value of the mean GO similarity (which we will
call GO P—value from now on) by comparing the mean GO similarity
with a hundred thousand other mean GO similarities obtained from
random modules of the same size using the same genes. Since GO
P—values are obtained by comparing mean GO similarities with those

from random modules of the same size using the same genes, they
are not biased with regard to module size and are not biased due
to the gene pre—selection. We use the fraction of modules with G0
P <0.05 as a summary measure of performance of an algorithm.
LeTICE generated 15 modules and 7 of them (46.7%) have GO
P < 0.05. For a random set of modules, only 5% of them would have
GO P < 0.05. Therefore, this analysis supports the claim that LeTI CE
ﬁnds biologically meaningful results.

3.3 Application to heterogeneous datasets

LeTICE can be expected to work best when both location data
and expression data are obtained under the same conditions,
since both gene expression patterns and TF binding patterns are
highly condition dependent. However, we will illustrate that even
when LeTICE is applied to heterogeneous data, it can still ﬁnd
modules regulated by TFs whose binding patterns match the gene
transcription patterns. For this purpose, we apply LeTICE to the
expression data from Gasch et al. (2000) and the location data from
Harbison et al. (2004).

Gasch et al. (2000) measured changes in the expression levels of
6200 yeast genes over time under several different conditions. We
select the time series obtained when yeast was treated with hydrogen
peroxide (H2 02) since it is one of the longest time series. We use the
BRB array tool developed by Simon and Lam (2006) to pre—select
913 genes that are differentially expressed over time.

Harbison et al. (2004) obtained location data for 203 TFs in rich
media conditions. Of these 203 TFs, 84 were also proﬁled in at least
1 of 12 speciﬁc environmental conditions in which they were known
to be essential for growth. There were a total of 352 combinations of
TFs and conditions. Two of the 12 conditions match the condition
under which expression data were obtained: high level of H202
treatment and moderate level of H2 02 treatment.

The TRN found by LeTICE is shown in Figure 4. Rectangles
represent gene modules. Seven of the 13 modules (53.8%) drawn

with bold border lines have GO P<0.05. TF—condition pairs are
represented by the TF names and the conditions connected by a
dash. ‘YPD’ represents rich media, ‘SM’, amino acid starvation,
‘RAPA’, nutrient deprivation, ‘H202Hi’, high level H202 treatment
and ‘H202Lo’, moderate level H202 treatment.

The TFs in the network found by Le TI CE are completely different
from the cell—cycle TFs in Figure 2. For all active TFs with the
exception of FHL1, only binding patterns observed under rich media
or H202 treatment are correlated with expression levels. Module
11 is regulated by FHL1 under conditions ‘YPD’, ‘RAPA’ and
‘SM’. The bindings of FHL1 appear not to be condition—speciﬁc
for genes in Module 11. The ﬁve TFs in the network proﬁled under
H2 02 treatment are known to be essential for growth or implicated
in gene regulation in the condition of H202 treatment (Harbison
et al., 2004). This again supports that LeTI CE can identify the right
condition—speciﬁc TFs.

This result suggests that LeTICE can identify condition—speciﬁc
TFs and can learn a meaningful result even when the condition of
the expression and location data are different.

3.4 Beneﬁts from integrating location and expression
data

We investigated the beneﬁt of integrating location and expression
data compared to using only one of the two data types.

First, we generated modules from expression data only. We used
partitioning around medoids (Kaufman and Rousseeuw, 1990) to
cluster the 510 genes used in our analysis into 41 subsets so that the
average size of the subsets is similar to the average size of modules
found by LeTI CE . We deﬁne subsets containing at least ﬁve genes as
modules. The percentage of modules having GO P < 0.05 is 26.7%.

Second, we generated modules by using only location data with a
ﬁxed P—value cutoff [90. We set By :1 if the P—value between gene
i and TF j is less than [90, and By 2 0 otherwise. A set of at least ﬁve
genes having the same binding pattern is deﬁned as a module. For
each TF j for which the number of genes with Bi]- :1 is less than
ﬁve, we zeroed out those Blj because we restrict the module size to
be at least ﬁve, which is equivalent to requiring that every TF binds
at least ﬁve genes if it binds any.

For the frequently used cutoff 190 20.005, there are 54 TFs,
each of which regulates at least ﬁve genes. These TFs include
the 12 condition—speciﬁc TFs LeTICE found. While most of the
12 TFs have key roles in cell—cycle regulation, the remaining 42
TFs do not, which shows that LeTI CE ﬁnds better candidates
for condition—speciﬁc TFs than using the ﬁxed P—value cutoff for
location data.

Since there are many TFs regulating genes, many small subsets
of genes having the same binding pattern are generated. Only 11 of
them have size at least ﬁve. Of these modules, the percentage with
G0 P<0.05 is 18.2%.

These results show that the integration of location and expression
data does help to ﬁnd better modules and better candidates for
condition—speciﬁc TFs.

4 DISCUSSION

We developed LeTICE, an algorithm for building a TRN by
integrating expression and location data. The TRN is deﬁned by
a binding matrix B, which partitions genes into modules and a

background. We deﬁned a likelihood P(BlE,L) and then ﬁnd the
matrix B maximizing P(BlE,L) through an optimization process.

The contribution of LeTICE is 2—fold: ﬁrst, it produces
biologically meaningful results and second, it is methodologically
innovative.

4.1 Biological results

- LeTICE found 12 condition—speciﬁc TFs including key cell—
cycle regulators ACE2, FKH2, MBP1, MCM1, NDD1, SW14,
SW15 and SW16.

0 LeTICE generated 15 modules each of which is highly
represented with functions related to the cell—cycle regulation
such as DNA synthesis, repair, compacting newly synthesized
DNA, cytokinesis, cell wall construction and DNA pre—
replication complex formation. The internal homogeneity of
the modules as measured by GO similarity is superior to that
of modules found by using only expression data or location
data.

0 LeTICE generated a TF network containing TFs MBP1,
SW14/5/6, NDD1, MCM1, FKH2 and ACE2 known to play
key roles in regulating the cell cycle. Interestingly, it is almost
identical to the previously derived cell—cycle transcriptional
network (Simon et al., 2001) although it was generated
automatically using all 113 TFs, while the previously derived
TF network was generated using only nine key cell—cycle
regulators.

4.2 Methodological innovations

0 LeTICE uses a probabilistic model for the binary binding
matrix given the location and expression data. It integrates
two heterogeneous data sources in a principled way without
requiring arbitrary weights or thresholds.

0 LeTI CE does not require any assumptions about the distribution
of the expression data since it uses a non—parametric model. It
does not rely on the questionable assumption that the expression
levels of TFs and regulated genes are correlated. It only makes
the weaker assumption that genes regulated by the same TFs
tend to show similar expression proﬁles.

- LeTICE generates all gene modules simultaneously using the
entire set of TFs, while other algorithms (Bar—Joseph et al.,
2003; Lemmens et al., 2006) ﬁnd gene modules sequentially
using subsets of TFs. It can cope with combinatorial
interactions of TFs and is able to ﬁnd condition—speciﬁc TFs.

4.3 Future work

Although location data provide the most accurate information about
physical bindings between TFs and genes, due to their high condition
dependency, they can only reveal parts of the TRN active in the given
speciﬁc condition.

In contrast to location data, motif data are abundant and condition
independent. Motif data contain ample information from lots of
research and especially for yeast, many TFs have known target
binding motifs. Motif data and location data are essentially about
the same thing: TF binding. In principle, our probabilistic approach
to integrating location and expression data should also be applicable
to motif data. The problem with motif data is that they contain
many more false positives since motifs are merely potential binding

sites, which may not be bound by TFs. Therefore, the probability
distribution of B given motif occurrences needs to take into account
of high false positive rates of motifs, whereas the non—parametric
likelihood for measuring compactness of expression levels of genes
in modules should still be applicable.

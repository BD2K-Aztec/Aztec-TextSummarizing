ABSTRACT

Motivation: A number of statistical phylogenetic methods have been
developed to infer conserved functional sites or regions in proteins.
Many methods, e.g. Rate4Site, apply the standard phylogenetic
models to infer site-specific substitution rates and totally ignore the
spatial correlation of substitution rates in protein tertiary structures,
which may reduce their power to identify conserved functional
patches in protein tertiary structures when the sequences used in
the analysis are highly similar. The 3D sliding window method has
been proposed to infer conserved functional patches in protein tertiary
structures, but the window size, which reflects the strength of the
spatial correlation, must be predefined and is not inferred from data.
We recently developed GP4Rate to solve these problems under the
Bayesian framework. Unfortunately, GP4Rate is computationally slow.
Here, we present an intuitive web server, FuncPatch, to perform a fast
approximate Bayesian inference of conserved functional patches in
protein tertiary structures.

Results: Both simulations and four case studies based on empirical
data suggest that FuncPatch is a good approximation to GP4Rate.
However, FuncPatch is orders of magnitudes faster than GP4Rate.
In addition, simulations suggest that FuncPatch is potentially a useful
tool complementary to Rate4Site, but the 3D sliding window method is
less powerful than FuncPatch and Rate4Site. The functional patches
predicted by FuncPatch in the four case studies are supported by ex-
perimental evidence, which corroborates the usefulness of FuncPatch.

1 INTRODUCTION

Because of the fast development of sequencing techniques, the
amount of sequence data is increasing exponentially. The best
ways to extract biological insights from massive sequence data
have become important questions in biology. Comparisons be-
tween homologous sequences from different species are very
common strategies to analyze biological sequences. For example,
given a set of homologous protein sequences from different

species, we can compare these sequences to identify conserved
amino acid sites. These conserved amino acid sites are more
likely to be functionally important, since mutations at these
sites are more likely to be deleterious.

To infer the conservation levels of amino acid sites, we need
evolutionary models to describe the substitution process of
amino acids in the evolutionary history. The simplest idea is to
use the standard statistical phylogenetic models (Felsenstein,
1981) to infer the site-speciﬁc substitution rates and the sites
with low substitution rates may be considered to be functional.
For example, a widely used web server, ConSurf (Ashkenazy
et al., 2010; Glaser et al., 2003), uses the site-specific substitution
rates estimated by the Rate4Site program (Mayrose et al., 2004)
to infer the conservation levels of amino acid sites. Then,
the conservation scores are mapped onto the protein tertiary
structure to get insights on the possible functions of the highly
conserved sites (Glaser et al., 2003). While the standard phylo-
genetic models are useful tools for inferring conserved sites in
proteins, they typically model the substitution rate variation by
some discretized distributions, e.g. the discretized Gamma distri-
bution (Yang, 1994), and ignore the spatial correlation of
substitution rates in protein tertiary structures. However, it is
well known that functional amino acids are clustered together
in protein tertiary structures in many proteins and modeling the
spatial clustering can improve the prediction of functional sites
(Madabushi et al., 2002; Panchenko et al., 2004). The independ-
ence assumption of site-specific substitution rates in the standard
phylogenetic methods may make it difficult to infer conserved
functional patches in protein tertiary structures. The problem is
especially acute when the sequences used in the analysis are very
similar to each other, because it is difﬁcult to estimate site-spe-
cific substitution rates accurately in this scenario due to the lim-
ited information at each amino acid site.

A few methods have been proposed to relax the independence
assumption of site-specific substitution rates to predict conserved
protein patches in protein tertiary structures (Capra and Singh,
2007; Dean and Golding, 2000; Landgraf et al., 2001; Nimrod
et al., 2005; Panchenko et al., 2004;). These methods are useful
tools for inferring conserved protein patches, especially when the
sequences in the dataset are highly similar. However, most of
these methods are based on the 3D sliding window framework
(Capra and Singh, 2007; Dean and Golding, 2000; Landgraf
et al., 2001; Panchenko et al., 2004) or other heuristic algorithms
(Nimrod et al., 2005). The common problem of these methods is
that they cannot infer the strength of the spatial correlation
of substitution rates, which in turn makes the inference of site-
specific substitution rates unreliable. For example, the window

size in the 3D sliding window method is typically predefined
before analyses. However, the strength of spatial correlation
may vary in different proteins, which suggests that the optimal
window size may vary in different datasets (Suzuki, 2004).

Recently, we developed a phylogenetic Gaussian process
model, GP4Rate, which combines standard phylogenetics
and Gaussian processes to infer conserved functional regions in
protein tertiary structures (Huang and Golding, 2014). Using
the Gaussian process as the prior distribution of log values of
site-specific substitution rates, GP4Rate naturally captures the
spatial correlation of substitution rates in the protein tertiary
structure. In addition, GP4Rate can infer the strength of the
spatial correlation of substitution rates based on the Bayesian
principle. Therefore, it overcomes the drawbacks of the 3D
sliding window method and other heuristic methods.

However, GP4Rate is based on Markov chain Monte Carlo
(MCMC) methods to generate samples from the posterior distri-
bution of parameters. Because MCMC methods are generally
very slow, it typically takes a few hours to a few days to analyze
a gene family using GP4Rate. In addition, the command-line
interface of GP4Rate may not be intuitive to many experimental
biologists. Here, we report a new algorithm, FuncPatch, which is
designed as a fast approximation to GP4Rate. This method
is fast enough to be implemented in a web server. Using a
simplified likelihood function and a Laplace approximation,
FuncPatch is orders of magnitudes faster than GP4Rate and
the analyses of most gene families can be finished in a few
minutes. Both simulations and four case studies based on empir-
ical data demonstrate that FuncPatch is a very accurate approxi-
mation to GP4Rate. In simulations, FuncPatch is always among
the most powerful methods regardless of the assumptions of the
simulations. Furthermore, FuncPatch could be more powerful
than Rate4Site when a spatial correlation of substitution rates
is present and the sequences in the simulated alignments are
highly similar. In contrast, the performance of the 3D sliding
window method is generally very poor. Therefore, FuncPatch
is complementary to Rate4Site and is particularly useful to
infer conserved 3D patches in a set of highly similar protein
sequences. The four case studies suggest that the spatial correl-
ation of substitution rates is present in real data and that the
strength of spatial correlation may vary in different protein
families.

2 MODELS

2.1 Overview of FuncPatch

We developed FuncPatch, an algorithm for the fast Bayesian
inference of conserved patches in protein tertiary structures.
FuncPatch is designed as a fast approximation to GP4Rate
(Huang and Golding, 2014), which combines phylogenetics and
Gaussian processes to infer conserved functional patches in pro-
tein tertiary structures. In this section, we describe the basic idea
of FuncPatch in simple terms and ignore mathematical details.
Thereafter, we describe technical details of the parameterization
and implementation of FuncPatch. Readers who are not familiar
with computational statistics may read this section but skip these
technical sections. FuncPatch assumes that the users provide
an alignment of proteins and a representative protein tertiary

structure. Similar to GP4Rate (Huang and Golding, 2014),
it combines the information from the protein alignment and
the protein tertiary structure to infer site-specific substitution
rate at each amino acid site. The estimated substitution rates
are used as proxies of functionality: lower substitution rates
suggest that the corresponding sites are more likely to be
functionally important.

If conserved functional sites form tertiary patches, e. g. protein—
protein interaction interfaces, the site-specific substitution rates
may be positively correlated over the protein tertiary structure.
Thus, physically closely located sites are more likely to have
similar substitution rates. Modeling the spatial correlation of
substitution rates may in turn improve the prediction of conserved
functional patches, since the inference of substitution rate at a
focal amino acid site can borrow ‘statistical information’ from
closely located sites with similar substitution rates (Huang and
Golding, 2014). FuncPatch uses the Bayesian statistical principle
to infer site-specific substitution rates. To apply the Bayesian prin-
ciple, we need to specify a prior distribution over site-specific sub-
stitution rates and a likelihood function which describes the
probability of the observed data given the site-specific substitution
rates. In FuncPatch, the protein tertiary structure is used to
specify a prior distribution of substitution rates. Similar to
GP4Rate, we assume that the prior distribution of the log
values of site-specific substitution rates follows a Gaussian distri-
bution guided by the protein tertiary structure. The Gaussian
prior distribution has a very useful property that the log substitu-
tion rates of two physically closely located sites are strongly
correlated while the log substitution rates of two distant sites
are weakly correlated. Therefore, the Gaussian prior distribution
encourages the site-specific log substitution rates to be smoothly
distributed over the protein tertiary structure.

To fully define the Bayesian model, we also need to specify
the likelihood function. In our previous work of GP4Rate
(Huang and Golding, 2014), we used the standard phylogenetic
likelihood function (Felsenstein, 1981). However, the phylogen-
etic likelihood function is too computationally expensive for a
web server. Therefore, FuncPatch uses a simpler likelihood
function. First, we use the parsimony method implemented
in the PROTPARS program in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 1989)
to estimate the most parsimonious number of substitutions
at each site. Then, this number of substitutions is used as a
summary statistic in the likelihood function. The likelihood
function, which measures the probability of the most parsimo-
nious number of substitutions at a site given its site-specific
substitution rate, is assumed to follow a Poisson distribution.
The Poisson likelihood function significantly simplifies the
computation and, more importantly, makes it easy to design
efficient approximation algorithms to infer the posterior distri-
bution of site-specific substitution rates. The combination of
the Poisson likelihood function and the Gaussian process
priors has been studied in the area of Bayesian disease map-
ping (Vanhatalo and Vehtari, 2007; Vanhatalo et al., 2010).
We developed a customized C+ + program to implement
this model and then a user-friendly web server based on
BioPerl (Stajich et al., 2002) and Jmol (\Nillighagen and
Howard, 2007) was developed to make FuncPatch easily
usable to biologists.

Fast Bayesian inference of conserved functional patches

 

2.2 Poisson likelihood function

We assume that a protein alignment, a PDB file of a represen-
tative protein tertiary structure, a query PDB chain name, a
query sequence name and an optional phylogenetic tree are pro-
vided by the users. The query sequence name should be the exact
name of a sequence in the protein alignment and the query
sequence should correspond to the query PDB chain. If the
users do not provide a phylogenetic tree, FuncPatch generates
a neighbor-joining tree automatically (Saitou and Nei, 1987).
The phylogenetic tree used in FuncPatch is denoted by T.
Then FuncPatch uses MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) to align the
query sequence with the query PDB chain to generate a guide
alignment. A set of informative sites are chosen from the original
alignment based on the guide alignment. An informative site
must meet three conditions: (i) it must match an amino acid in
the query PDB chain; (ii) at least three sequences in the original
alignment must have amino acids instead of gaps at the site; (iii)
the number of gaps at the site must be less than a half of the
number of sequences in the original alignment. The informative
sites form a new alignment denoted by X and the number of sites
in the alignment X is denoted by N. Then, FuncPatch uses
the PROTPARS program in PHYLIP (Felsenstein, 1989) to
estimate, C, a vector of the most parsimonious number of
substitutions for each site in X, in which a single element C,- is
the most parsimonious number of substitutions at site i.
FuncPatch assumes that C,, the most parsimonious number of
substitutions at site 1', follows a Poisson distribution,

Ci

where A,- denotes the expected number of substitutions at site i
[which will be described in detail in Equation (5)].

2.3 Gaussian prior distribution

Given the alignment X, FuncPatch calculates, ,8, the average
number of substitutions over all sites,

N
ﬂ= L"; Ci. (2)

Based on the 3D coordinates of the or carbons of amino acids in
the user provided PDB file, FuncPatch then calculates a distance
matrix D in which an element Di]- measures the Euclidean dis-
tance between sites i and j in the alignment X. Similar to
GP4Rate (Huang and Golding, 2014), we assume that the
prior distribution of CD, the vector of site-specific log substitution
rates, follows a zero-mean Gaussian distribution,

T O.—1
_q> 2(1),], ) cp), (3)

l
P (I) D, I, = N—l
( I 0) (2762120), z,a)|:exp( 2

where 2(D, 1,0) is the covariance matrix. We assume that the
covariance matrix 2(D, 1,0) is parameterized by the Matérn 1.5
covariance function,

2U=02(1+ @)exp(—@), (4)

where Di]- is the Euclidean distance between sites i and j, l is the
characteristic length scale and o is the signal standard deviation.
[is a positive number, which measures the strength of the spatial
correlation of the site-specific log substitution rates over the
protein tertiary structure. A large 1 implies that the spatial
correlation is strong while a small 1 implies that the spatial
correlation is weak. a is a positive number which measures the
marginal variation of site-specific log substitution rates at a
single site. It is easy to show that, in Equation (4), 2,-1- decreases
with increasing D,-J-, which implies that the closely located sites are
more likely to have similar substitution rates than the distantly
located sites. Therefore, the Gaussian prior distribution naturally
captures our intuition that site-specific substitution rates are
smoothly distributed over the tertiary structure. Similar to
GP4Rate, FuncPatch introduces a very small amount of noise
(‘jitter’ term) to the diagonal elements in the covariance matrix to
ensure that its Cholesky decomposition is numerically stable.

To connect the Poisson likelihood function with the Gaussian
prior distribution, we assume that the relationship between 2,,
i.e. the expected number of substitutions at site i, and 613,-, i.e. the
log substitution rate at site i, can be described by the following
equation,

A.- = B 6X}? ((1%), (5)

where ,6 is the average number of substitutions calculated by
Equation (2). In this parameterization, the site-specific substitu-
tion rate, i.e. exp ((1),), is a scaling factor, which is analogous to
the substitution rate parameters in statistical phylogenetic
models.

By inserting Equation (5) into Equation (1) and then combin-
ing Equations (3) and (l), we obtain the posterior distribution
of (I),

N
P(<I>|l, o, c, D) ~P(<I>|D, 1, o) Hag-m exp (6,». (6)

Posterior Prior Likelihood
Note that the right-hand side of Equation (6) is proportional
to the posterior distribution up to a constant Z which is the
marginal likelihood of the observed data given the hyperpara—
meters, i.e. l and o. The posterior distribution is log concave,
so it has only a single stationary point which is also the global
maximum. FuncPatch uses the L-BFGS—B algorithm (Zhu et al.,
1997) to find the global maximum of the posterior
distribution and then uses a Laplace approximation to calculate
the approximate posterior distribution of CD and the approximate
marginal likelihood Z (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005).
The Laplace approximation uses the location of the global max-
imum in the posterior distribution and the second-order deriva-
tives at the maximum to construct a Gaussian distribution to
approximate the posterior distribution of CD (Rasmussen and
Williams, 2005). For each site i in X, the Laplace approximation
can calculate E,- and S,- based on the approximate posterior
distribution, where E,- is the approximate posterior mean of CD,-
and S,- is the approximate posterior standard deviation of
613,-. We use exp (E,) as the estimated substitution rate at site i
and the interval (exp(E,- — 067455,), exp(E,-+0.6745$,)) as the
approximate 50% credible interval at site i, in which 0.6745 cor-
responds to the 75% quantile of the standard Gaussian
distribution.

2.4 Inference of hyperparameters and Bayesian model
comparison

The descriptions in the previous sections assume that the two
hyperparameters, i.e. l and a, are known. In real data analyses,
we need to estimate these hyperparameters from data.
FuncPatch performs a grid search to generate a point estimation
of parameters. We ochoose 20 representatives 1, evenly spaced
between 1 and 39 A, and 20 representatives 0, evenly spaced
between 0.1 and 3.9. Therefore, there are 400 different combin-
ations of hyperparameters based on these representative values.
Then, FuncPatch performs a Laplace approximation for each
combination of hyperparameters to calculate the approximate
marginal likelihood Z (Rasmussen and Williams, 2005).
The combination of hyperparameters with the largest marginal
likelihood Z is chosen as the point estimation of the hyperpara-
meters. The average of the marginal likelihoods over all combin-
ations of hyperparameters is used as the overall marginal
likelihood of the model, which implies that we put a uniform
hyperprior over hyperparameters.

To evaluate whether the spatial correlation of substitution
rates is significant in a dataset, we developed a test based on
the Bayesian model comparison. The model described above is
the alternative model (model 1) in the Bayesian model compari-
son. We also designed a null model (model 0) in which any
spatial correlation of substitution rates is absent. In model 0,
we assume that the characteristic length scale I is always equal
to 0, which essentially removes the spatial correlation from the
Gaussian prior distribution. Twenty representative signal stand-
ard deviations o are evenly spaced between 0.1 and 3.9 as model
1. The average marginal likelihood over the 20 combinations of
hyperparameters is used as the overall marginal likelihood
of model 0. We suggest that 8 may be used as a conservative
cutoff for the log Bayes factor (model 1 versus model 0).
If the estimated log Bayes factor is larger than 8 in a dataset,
we consider that the spatial correlation of site-specific substitu-
tion rates is significant in the dataset.

3 SIMULATIONS AND CASE STUDIES

3.1 Simulations

We evaluated the performance of FuncPatch and compared it
with the performances of GP4Rate (Huang and Golding, 2014),
Rate4Site (Mayrose et al., 2004) and a customized 3D sliding
window program based on the Bio+ + library (Dutheil et al.,
2006; Gueguen et al., 2013). In the comparison, Rate4Site is used
as a representative of methods which ignore the spatial correl-
ation of site-specific substitution rates in protein tertiary
structures. The 3D sliding window program is similar to
the methods described in previous studies (Berglund et al.,
2005; Dean and Golding, 2000; Suzuki, 2004). In the 3D sliding
window program, the J TT substitution model (Jones et al., 1992)
is used to describe the substitution process of amino acids.
We assume that a window size and a reference phylogenetic
tree have been provided by the users. For each site in the protein
tertiary structure, the 3D sliding window program first collects
the set of sites whose Euclidean distances to the focal site is
smaller than the window size to generate a local alignment and
then optimizes the scale of the reference phylogenetic tree given

the local alignment. The tree scale is considered to be the
estimated substitution rate at the focal site. We used two
window sizes in the 3D sliding window program. The small
window size (7 A) may be more powerful to capture small con-
served patches while the large window size (15 A) may be more
powerful to capture large conserved patches.

We generated four sets of simulated alignments (A—D) based
on the human Bcl-xL protein to benchmark the performances of
FuncPatch, GP4Rate, Rate4Site and the customized 3D sliding
window program, respectively. To generate simulated align-
ments, we need to specify a substitution model, a reference
protein structure, a reference phylogenetic tree and a set of
reference site-specific substitution rates. In all simulations, the
JTT substitution model (Jones et al., 1992) was used to describe
the substitution process of amino acids and the protein tertiary
structure of the human Bcl-xL protein (PDB ID: 1MAZ;
Muchmore et al., 1996) was used as the reference structure.
The reference phylogenetic trees and the reference site-specific
substitution rates were different in the four simulated datasets,
which will be described in detail below.

0 The 100 alignments in dataset A were generated using a small
reference phylogenetic tree. As shown in Supplementary
Figure SlA, the small phylogenetic tree consists of four se-
quences and the total branch length is equal to 1. Therefore,
the expected number of substitutions per site is equal to l,
which is comparable to the expected numbers of substitutions
per site in many empirical datasets which only consist of
orthologous sequences. We expect that it is relatively difficult
to estimate site-specific substitution rates accurately in this
scenario due to the relatively small number of substitutions
per site. The reference substitution rates used in the step
of generating alignments were downloaded from the
ConSurf-DB database (Goldenberg et al., 2009), which
automatically collected a large number of homologs of the
human Bcl-xL protein and then used Rate4Site to estimate
site-specific substitution rates. It is expected that the spatial
correlation of substitution rates is present in this dataset,
since a previous study based on Rate4Site has suggested
that the inferred conserved sites are clustered together in
the protein tertiary structure of the human Bcl-xL protein
(Glaser et al., 2003).

o The 100 alignments in dataset A were permuted randomly to
generate the 100 alignments in dataset B. The permutations
destroyed the spatial correlation of substitution rates but
kept all other features of the alignments. This dataset was
designed to test the performances of different methods when
the reference phylogenetic tree is small and a spatial correl-
ation of substitution rates is absent.

0 The 100 alignments in dataset C were based on a large
reference phylogenetic tree (Supplementary Fig. SlB).
There are 12 sequences in the phylogenetic tree and
the expected number of substitutions per site is equal
to 4.2, which is comparable to the expected numbers of
substitutions per site in many empirical datasets consisting
of paralogous sequences. Therefore, we predict that it is
relatively easy to estimate site-specific substitution rates in
this scenario, because the generated protein sequences are

highly diverged. Similar to dataset A, the substitution rates
downloaded from the ConSurf-DB database (Goldenberg
et al., 2009) were used to generate dataset C. Therefore, the
spatial correlation of site-specific substitution rates is present
in this dataset.

o The 100 alignments in dataset C were permuted randomly to
generate the 100 alignments in dataset D. This dataset was
designed to test the performances of different methods when
the reference phylogenetic tree is large while a spatial
correlation of substitution rates is absent.

We applied FuncPatch, GP4Rate, Rate4Site and the custo-
mized 3D sliding window program to the four sets of simulated
alignments. The reference phylogenetic trees (Supplementary
Fig. S1) were used as the input trees in all analyses. For
GP4Rate, two independent MCMC chains were implemented
for each alignment and the first 30% of samples were discarded
as burn-in. We used the ROCR package in R (Sing et al., 2005)
to plot the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to
evaluate the statistical powers of the four programs. To perform
the ROC analyses, we need to define a cutoff of percentage
which corresponds to the proportion of functional sites in the
simulated alignments. We assumed that the cutoff of percentage
is equal to 10%, which suggests that the 10% of sites with the
lowest reference substitution rates were considered as functional
sites. Similar results are reached using different cutoffs, e.g. 30
and 50% (data not shown).

As shown in Figure 1, FuncPatch and GP4Rate generally have
similar powers in the four simulated datasets. More importantly,
FuncPatch and GP4Rate are always among the most powerful
methods. Therefore, FuncPatch is a good approximation to
GP4Rate and the two methods are robust against different as-
sumptions. More specifically, when the spatial correlation of sub-
stitution rates is present and the reference phylogenetic tree is
small (Fig. 1A), FuncPatch and GP4Rate could be more power-
ful than Rate4Site. When a spatial correlation of substitution
rates is absent and the reference phylogenetic tree is small,
FuncPatch is only marginally less powerful than GP4Rate and
Rate4Site (Fig. 1B). When a large phylogenetic tree is used in
simulations, the powers of FuncPatch and GP4Rate are very
similar to that of Rate4Site regardless of whether the spatial
correlation of substitution rates is present or not (Fig. 1C and
D). It is not surprising, since when the phylogenetic tree is large,
each site in the alignment is informative and it is relatively easy to
infer the site-specific substitution rate accurately based on the
information at a single site. The 3D sliding window method is
almost always among the least powerful methods in the four
simulated datasets, which may be due to the difficulty of deter-
mining the optimal window size.

In summary, the simulations demonstrate that FuncPatch is a
good approximation to GP4Rate and may be a useful tool com-
plementary to Rate4Site. In contrast, the performance of the 3D
sliding window method is generally very poor.

3.2 Case study of MAPKl genes

To demonstrate the power of FuncPatch in analyses with real
data, we applied FuncPatch to four signal transduction-related
gene families to predict conserved functional patches. As shown

with GP4Rate and Rate4Site. In this section, we report the
results of the MAPKl (ERK2) gene family which is a central
player in signal transduction. The MAPKl gene family is a
member of the mitogen—activated protein kinase (MAPK) super-
family. In the activation of the MAPK/ERK pathway, cell
surface receptors are first activated by extra-cellular ligands
and then the cell surface receptors activate a series of factors,
including MAPKs (Seger and Krebs, 1995). MAPKs thus
activate a variety of downstream transcriptional factors.

We downloaded the protein sequences of 17 MAPKl ortho-
logous genes from the NCBI HomoloGene database
(HomoloGene ID: 37670; Sayers et al., 2012). The dataset cor-
responds to a set of representative MAPKl sequences collected
from vertebrates, invertebrates, plants and fungi. We only
included the MAPKl subfamily in the analysis and excluded
other MAPK subfamilies, because the biological functions of
the MAPKl subfamily may be different from the functions of
other MAPK subfamilies and the locations of conserved func-
tional patches might be different in different subfamilies.
Therefore, the level of sequence divergence is relatively low

in this dataset, which makes it difficult to accurately infer site-
specific substitution rates in individual sites. The 17 MAPKl
protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004)
with default parameters. The phylogenetic tree was inferred using
PhyML with the JT T + 1‘ model (Guindon and Gascuel, 2003).
We used the X-ray crystallographic structure of the rat MAPKl
gene (PDB ID: lERK; Zhang et al., 1994) as the representative
structure.

We applied FuncPatch with default parameters to the
MAPKl dataset. As shown in Table l, the best estimation of
characteristic length scale is equal to 21 A, which is much larger
than 0. It suggests that spatial correlation of substitution rates is
extended over a very long distance. The statistical significance of
the spatial correlation of substitution rates is supported by the
Bayesian model comparison. The approximate log Bayes factor
(model 1 versus model 0) is equal to 148.7 which is significantly
larger than the cutoff 8 (Table 1). To furthermore demonstrate

that the cutoff 8 is valid, we randomly permuted the MAPKl
alignment 1000 times to generate a set of new alignments. The
potential spatial correlation of substitution rates has been des-
troyed in these permuted alignments and we applied FuncPatch
to them to generate a null distribution of the log Bayes factors.
As shown in Figure 2A, only 2.6% of permuted alignments’ log
Bayes factors are greater than 8, which confirms that the cutoff 8
is conservative. Therefore, the spatial correlation of substitution
rates is statistically significant in the MAPKl dataset Via both
the Bayes factor and the permutations.

We superimposed the 35 most conserved sites predicted by
FuncPatch onto the protein structure of the rat MAPKl gene
(PDB ID: lERK). Because the MAPKl dataset consists of 357
sites, the 35 sites correspond to the 10% of most conserved sites
in MAPKl. As shown in Figure 3A, the 35 most conserved sites
form a clearly bounded patch in the protein tertiary structure.
The result is not surprising because the estimated characteristic
length scale is very large. We further investigated whether this
predicted conserved patch is related to MAPKl’s activities.
Interestingly, previous studies suggest that Asp-147, the second
most conserved site predicted by FuncPatch, acts as the catalytic
residue (Canagarajah et al., 1997; Turjanski et al., 2009; Zhang
et al., 1994). Therefore, the predicted conserved patch corres-
ponds to the catalytic site of MAPKl. The high conservation
of neighboring sites of Asp-147 suggests that these sites might
be important to mediate the interaction between MAPKl and its
substrate proteins or maintain a suitable local environment for
the kinase reaction.

We also applied GP4Rate and Rate4Site to the MAPKl data-
set and mapped the 35 most conserved sites onto the protein
tertiary structure of the rat MAPKl gene (PDB ID: lERK).
As shown in Figure 3A, GP4Rate reported essentially the same
conserved patch as the one reported by FuncPatch. The consist-
ency between FuncPatch and GP4Rate is not surprising, because
the simulation study has already demonstrated that FuncPatch
and GP4Rate have similar powers to identify conserved func-
tional patches. However, FuncPatch took only about 1 CPU
minute to analyze the MAPKl dataset whereas GP4Rate took
about 33 CPU hours to analyze the same dataset. Therefore,
FuncPatch is orders of magnitudes faster than GP4Rate in the
MAPKl dataset.

In contrast, the most conserved sites predicted by Rate4Site
are very different from the conserved sites predicted by
FuncPatch and GP4Rate (Fig. 3A). Indeed, the most conserved
sites predicted by Rate4Site are scattered in the protein tertiary
structure and do not form any clearly bounded 3D patch.
In addition, Asp-147, i.e. the catalytic residue, is not included
in the 35 most conserved sites predicted by Rate4Site, even
though it is invariant across all sequences in the MAPKl align-
ment. The reason that Asp-147 is not included in the set of most
conserved sites predicted by Rate4Site is that there are a number
of invariant sites in the MAPKl alignment. Therefore, it is dif-
ficult to know which one is more conserved than the others
based on the information at individual sites. In contrast,
FuncPatch models the spatial correlation of substitution rates
and the invariant sites in the core regions of the conserved
patches tend to have lower estimated substitution rates than
other invariant sites scattered in the protein tertiary structure.

using Jmol Millighagen and Howard, 2007)

3.3 Case study of SMAD genes

SMAD genes are important factors which mediate the transduc-
tion of signals from extracellular ligands to downstream factors
(Attisano and Tuen Lee-Hoeflich, 2001). We downloaded the
protein sequences of 11 SMADl genes (HomoloGene ID:
21196), 9 SMAD5 genes (HomoloGene ID: 4313) and 10
SMAD8 genes (HomoloGene ID: 21198) from the NCBI
HomoloGene database (Sayers et al., 2012). All these sequences
are receptor-regulated SMAD (R-SMAD) genes regulated by
bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) (Attisano and Tuen Lee-
Hoeﬂich, 2001). MUSCLE (Edgar, 2004) with default param-
eters was used to generate an alignment based on the 30
SMAD proteins and then PhyML with the JTT+I‘ model
(Guindon and Gascuel, 2003) was used to generate the reference
phylogenetic tree. We did not include other SMAD genes in the
NCBI HomoloGene database (Sayers et al., 2012), because these
SMAD genes are either not R-SMAD genes or not regulated by

BMPs and may have different functions from the BMP—regulated
R-SMAD genes (Attisano and Tuen Lee-Hoeﬂich, 2001). The R-
SMAD proteins consist of two domains, i.e. MAD homology 1
(MHl) and MAD homology 2, connected by a disordered pep-
tide (Attisano and Tuen Lee-Hoeflich, 2001). We used the X-ray
crystallographic structure of the MHl domain in the mouse
SMADl protein (PDB ID: 3KMP; Baburajendran et al., 2010)
as the representative protein tertiary structure.

We applied FuncPatch to the SMAD dataset to infer con-
served functional patches in the SMAD MHl domain.
FuncPatch analyzed 124 sites in the SMAD alignment. As
shown in Table l, the estimated characteristic length scale is
equal to 9 A in the SMAD dataset. Because the estimated char-
acteristic length scale is larger than 0, a spatial correlation of
substitution rates may be present in the SMAD dataset.
Indeed, the approximate log Bayes factor reported by
FuncPatch is greater than the cutoff 8 (Table l), which suggests

that the spatial correlation of substitution rates is statistically
significant in the SMAD dataset. To test whether the cutoff 8
is valid in the SMAD dataset, we again generated 1000 permuted
alignments based on the SMAD alignment and then applied
FuncPatch to these permuted alignments to generate a null dis-
tribution of the approximate log Bayes factors. As shown in
Figure 2, none of the 1000 permuted alignments has a log
Bayes factor larger than 8. Therefore, the cutoff 8 is conservative
in the SMAD dataset.

We superimposed the 12 most conserved sites predicted by
FuncPatch onto the tertiary structure of the MHl domain
(Fig. 3B), which correspond to the 10% of most conserved
sites in the 124 analyzed sites. Obviously the most conserved
sites predicted by FuncPatch are physically close to each other
in the protein tertiary structure. In addition, most of these con-
served sites overlap with the a-helix 4 of the MHl domain. A
previous experimental study has already demonstrated that this
region is a binding site which may interact with calmodulin and
may contribute to the crosstalk between the calmodulin pathway
and the SMAD pathway (Scherer and Graff, 2000). Therefore,
the conserved region predicted by FuncPatch is supported by
experimental evidence.

We also applied GP4Rate and Rate4Site to the SMAD data-
set. As shown in Figure 3B, the 12 most conserved sites predicted
by GP4Rate largely overlap with the 12 most conserved sites
predicted by FuncPatch. Therefore, FuncPatch is a good
approximation to GP4Rate. However, FuncPatch took only
about 6 CPU seconds to analyze the SMAD dataset whereas
GP4Rate took about 4 CPU hours. Again, FuncPatch is
orders of magnitudes faster than GP4Rate. In contrast, the 12
most conserved sites predicted by Rate4Site are scattered in the
protein tertiary structure and do not overlap with the sites
predicted by FuncPatch (Fig. 3B). Therefore, FuncPatch identi-
fied an experimentally verified conserved region in the SMAD
dataset which is overlooked by Rate4Site.

3.4 Case studies of MDM2 genes and RAS genes

MDM2 genes and RAS genes are important players in signal
transduction networks and many somatic mutations in these
genes can be drivers of cancer progression (\Neinberg, 2013).
Because MDM2 genes and RAS genes are important and well
studied, we applied FuncPatch, GP4Rate and Rate4Site to infer
conserved functional sites in these genes. We summarize the
results in this section and more details are described in
the Supplementary Material.

In both of the two case studies, FuncPatch and GP4Rate
predicted conserved patches while Rate4Site predicted spatially
scattered conserved sites. It is not surprising, since Rate4Site
implicitly ignores the possibility of spatial clustering of conserved
sites in protein tertiary structures. In addition, the conserved
patches predicted by FuncPatch and GP4Rate are essentially
identical, which again confirms that FuncPatch is a good
approximation to GP4Rate. However, FuncPatch is orders of
magnitudes faster than GP4Rate. By comparing the predicted
conserved sites with previous experimental studies, we found
that many conserved functional sites predicted by FuncPatch
are supported by previous experimental studies (Freedman
et al., 1997; Vetter et al., 1999). In contrast, only one conserved

functional site predicted by Rate4Site is directly supported by
existing experimental evidence. These results again highlight
that FuncPatch may be a potentially useful tool complementary
to Rate4Site.

4 DISCUSSION

Recently, we developed GP4Rate, a phylogenetic Gaussian
process model which combines statistical phylogenetics and
Gaussian processes to infer conserved functional regions in pro-
tein tertiary structures (Huang and Golding, 2014). Our previous
study has already shown that GP4Rate is a powerful method to
infer conserved functional regions and is potentially a useful
complementary to Rate4Site, but GP4Rate is a slow MCMC
program. In this study, we present a new statistical method,
FuncPatch, which is designed as a fast approximation to
GP4Rate. While it takes from hours to days for GP4Rate to
analyze a protein family, FuncPatch can finish a similar analysis
within a few minutes. An intuitive web-based graphical interface
of FuncPatch is available and makes it more accessible to experi-
mental biologists. Both simulations and four case studies suggest
that FuncPatch is an accurate approximation to GP4Rate.
The simulations also show that FuncPatch may be a useful
complementary to Rate4Site but the 3D sliding window
method typically leads to bad results. The conserved patches
predicted by FuncPatch in the four case studies are supported
by experimental evidence. Therefore, we believe FuncPatch is a
useful tool for analyzing protein families and guiding mutagen—
esis experiments.

Unlike many other alternative methods, e.g. the 3D sliding
window method, FuncPatch uses a Gaussian prior distribution
which naturally captures the spatial correlation of substitution
rates in protein tertiary structures. Therefore, it can infer the
strength of the spatial correlation of substitution rates. In add-
ition, a Bayesian model comparison method has been imple-
mented in FuncPatch to test whether the spatial correlation of
substitution rates is significant in a dataset. The four case studies
of empirical data suggest that the strength of the spatial correl-
ation may vary in different protein families and our preliminary
analyses on a few other protein families also suggest that the
spatial correlation of substitution rates may be insignificant in
some protein families (data not shown). We believe that the abil-
ity of inferring the strength and significance of the spatial cor-
relation of substitution rates is a significant advantage of
FuncPatch over the 3D sliding window method.

Our case studies in this work focus on four empirical datasets
in which the divergence levels of sequences are relatively low.
However, it is by no means the case that FuncPatch cannot be
used to analyze datasets in which the sequence divergence level is
high. As shown in the Supplementary Material, the site-specific
substitution rates estimated by FuncPatch are strongly correlated
with the rates estimated by Rate4Site in two large gene families
each of which consists of highly diverged sequences. Together
with the results in simulations, it seems that FuncPatch and
Rate4Site typically give similar results when the sequence
divergence levels are high. In practice, it is always helpful to
include more sequences in the analyses, if it is believed that
the sequences share the same conserved patches. However,
functional divergence may happen after gene duplication

(Gu, 1999; Knudsen and Miyamoto, 2001; Huang and Golding,
2012). Therefore, including remote homologs may reduce the
power of detecting functional patches unique to an orthologous
family. If researchers believe that a family of orthologous genes
has distinct biological functions from its remote homologs, it is
beneﬁcial to infer conserved patches solely based on the family
itself. The traditional methods, e.g. Rate4Site, may not be very
powerful in this scenario because of the limited information
about the substitution rate at each site. FuncPatch may alleviate
the problem, because the Gaussian process prior used in
FuncPatch can let an amino acid site to borrow statistical
strength from neighboring sites with similar substitution rates.
Therefore, FuncPatch is particularly useful for analyzing small
gene families or gene subfamilies derived from recent gene dupli-
cation events.

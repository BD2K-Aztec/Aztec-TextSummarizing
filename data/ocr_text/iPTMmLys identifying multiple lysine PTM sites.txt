Abstract

Motivation: Post—translational modification, abbreviated as PTM, refers to the change of the amino
acid side chains of a protein after its biosynthesis. Owing to its significance for in—depth under—
standing various biological processes and developing effective drugs, prediction of PTM sites in
proteins have currently become a hot topic in bioinformatics. Although many computational meth—
ods were established to identify various single—label PTM types and their occurrence sites in pro—
teins, no method has ever been developed for multi—label PTM types. As one of the most frequently
observed PTMs, the K—PTM, namely, the modification occurring at lysine (K), can be usually accom—
modated with many different types, such as ‘acetylation’, ‘crotonylation’, ‘methylation’ and ‘succi—
nylation’. Now we are facing an interesting challenge: given an uncharacterized protein sequence
containing many K residues, which ones can accommodate two or more types of PTM, which ones
only one, and which ones none?

Results: To address this problem, a multi—label predictor called iPTM-mLys has been developed. It
represents the first multi—label PTM predictor ever established. The novel predictor is featured by
incorporating the sequence—coupled effects into the general PseAAC, and by fusing an array of basic
random forest classifiers into an ensemble system. Rigorous cross—validations via a set of multi—label
metrics indicate that the first multi—label PTM predictor is very promising and encouraging.
Availability and Implementation: For the convenience of most experimental scientists, a user—
friendly web—server for iPTM-mLys has been established at http://MMANJci—bioinfo.cn/iPTM—mLys,
by which users can easily obtain their desired results without the need to go through the compli—
cated mathematical equations involved.

1 Introduction

identification of PTM sites in proteins has become a very hot topic
Post—translational modification (PTM or PTLM) means the change in bioinformatics (Chou, 2015a, b; Jia et 61]., 2016a, c, d; Qiu, et 61].,
of the amino acid side chains of a protein after its biosynthesis. Since 2014, 2015, 2016a, b; Xu and Chou, 2016; Xu et 61]., 2013a, b,

Among the 20 native amino acid residues, the modification at ly—
sine (K), the so—called K—PTM, is one of the most frequently
observed PTMs. Furthermore, some Lys residues in proteins can
undergo sequential or cascades of covalent modifications; i.e. they
can be targeted by various different K—PTM types, such as acetyl—
ation, biotinylation, butyrylation, crotonylation, methylation, pro—
pionylation, succinylation, ubiquitination and ubiquitin-like
modifications. Meanwhile, various computational methods have
been developed to predict the modification sites in proteins for dif-
ferent K—PTM types (Chen et al., 2006; Jia et al., 2016c; Qiu et al.,
2014, 2015; Shao et al., 2009; Xu et al., 2014a).

But to our best knowledge, so far no computational tool whatso—
ever can be used to deal with the system that simultaneously con—
tains several different K—PTM types or multiplex Lys residues.
Actually, this kind of multiplex Lys residues in proteins may have
some exceptional functions worthy of our special notice for both
basic research and drug development.

In view of this, the present study was initiated in an attempt to
fill such an empty field by establishing a novel method that can be
used to predict the multiple K—type modifications in proteins.

According to the Chou’s five—step guidelines (Chou, 2011) and
followed by many investigators in a series of recent publications
(Chen et al., 2016a, b; Jia et al., 2016a, b, c, d, e; Liu et al., 2016a,
b, c, d; Qiu et al., 2016a, b, c; Xiao et al., 2016), for developing a
new prediction method that can be widely used by broad users, we
should consider the following five points: (i) how to construct or se—
lect a valid benchmark dataset to train and test the predictor; (ii)
how to formulate the biological sequence samples with an effective
mathematical expression that can truly reflect their essential correl—
ation with the target concerned; (iii) how to introduce or develop a
powerful algorithm (or engine) to run the prediction; (iv) how to
properly conduct cross—validation tests to objectively evaluate the
anticipated accuracy; (v) how to provide a web—server and user guide
to make people very easily to get their desired results. In the rest of
this article, we are to address these point by point.

2 Materials and methods

2.1 Benchmark dataset

Note that so far, the statistically significant and experiment-
confirmed data are available only for the four K—PTM types: acetyl—
ation, crotonylation, methylation and succinylation. Thus, the pro—
teins used in this study were collected according to the following
procedures: (i) Open the web site at http://www.uniprot.org/, and
click the button ‘Advanced’. (ii) Select ‘PTlVUProcessing’ and
‘Modified residue [FT]’ for ‘Fields’. (iii) Select ‘Any experimental as—
sertion’ for ‘Evidence’. (iv) Type ‘human’ for ‘Term’ to do search.
(v) Collected were only those proteins that with keywords of ‘acetyl—
lysine’, ‘crotonyllysine’, ‘methyllysine’ or ‘succinyllysine’. (vi)
Collected were only those proteins that contain 50 and more amino
acid residues. Finally, we obtained 1769 working proteins.

To make the description logically more rigorous and clear, the
Chou’s scheme (Chou, 2001b) was adopted to formulate the peptide
samples, as done recently by many authors in studying the nitrotyro—
sine sites (Xu et al., 2014b), methylation sites (Qiu et al., 2014) and
carbonylation sites (Jia et al., 2016a). According to Chou’s scheme, a
potential K—PTM site—containing sample can be generally expressed by

PAK) = R—éR—(é—l) ---R—2R—1KR+1R+2 - "R+(§—1)R+§7 (1)

where the symbol K denotes the single amino acid code K, the sub—
script 5 is an integer, R_§ represents the f—th upstream amino acid

residue from the center, the R+§ the f—th downstream amino acid
residue, and so forth.

The detailed procedures to construct the benchmark datasets are
as follows. (i) As done in (Chou and Shen, 2007b), slide the
(25 —I— 1)—tuple peptide window along each of the aforementioned
1769 protein sequences, and collected were only those peptide seg—
ments that have K (Lys or lysine) at the center (Equation 1). (ii) If
the upstream or downstream in a protein sequence was less than i
or greater than L — f (L is the length of the protein sequence con—
cerned), the lacking amino acid was filled with the same residue as
its nearest one. (iii) The peptide segment samples thus obtained were
put into the positive subset if their centers have been experimentally
annotated as the acetylation site; otherwise, into the negative subset.
(iv) If there were two or more samples sharing a same sequence,
kept was only one of them. (v) Repeat the cycle of (i—iv) by succes—
sively changing ‘acetylation’ in (iii) to ‘crotonylation’, ‘methylation’
and ‘succinylation’, respectively. By doing so, we obtained the fol—
lowing four benchmark datasets

S5 (acetylation) : SE (acetylation) U SE (acetylation)

S5 (crotonylation) : SE (crotonylation) U SE (crotonylation)

7 (2)
S5 (methylation) : SE (methylation) U SE (methylation)

S5 (succinylation) : SE (succinylation) U SE (succinylation)

where the positive subset SE(acetylation) contains only the peptide
samples with their center residues K (Equation 1) confirmed by ex-
periments being able to be of acetylation, while the negative subset
SE(acetylation) only contains those samples unable to be of acetyl—
ation, and the symbol U denotes the union in the set theory.
Likewise, the remaining three sub—equations in Equation 2 have
exactly the same definition but refer to ‘crotonylation’, ‘methyla—
tion’ and ‘succinylation’, respectively. As we can see from Equations
1 and 2, with different i values, the benchmark datasets would con—
tain length-different samples.

However, many preliminary tests had indicated that the best out—
comes were obtained when E: 13; i.e. the sample’s length was
25 —l— 1 :27. Accordingly, hereafter we are focused on the 27—tuple
peptide samples only. Thus, Equations 1 and 2 can be reduced to

MK) : R_13R_12 - - -R_2R_1KR+1R+2 - ' 'R+12R+13 (3)

and

where the numerical argument 1, 2, 3 or 4 denotes ‘acetylation’,
‘crotonylation’, ‘methylation’ or ‘succinylation’, respectively.
The numbers of samples in the benchmark datasets are outlined in
Table 1, and their detailed sequences and positions in the proteins
are given in Supplementary Material.

2.2 Incorporate sequence—coupled effects into general
pseudo amino acid composition

With the avalanche of biological sequence generated in the post—
genomic age, one of the most important problems in computational
biology is how to formulate a biological sequence with a discrete
model or a vector, yet still considerably keep its sequence pattern or
essential feature. This is because all the existing machine-learning

algorithms can only handle vector but not sequence samples, as ela—
borated in Chou (2015a).

To address this problem, the pseudo—amino acid composition
(Chou, 2001a, 2005) or PseAAC was proposed. Ever since the con—
cept of pseudo—amino acid composition or Chou’s PseAAC (Cao,
et al., 2013; Du, et al., 2012; Lin and Lapointe, 2013) was pro—
posed, it has rapidly penetrated into nearly all the areas of computa—
tional proteomics (Ahmad, et al., 2016; Dehzangi, et al., 2015;
Kabir and Hayat, 2016; Khan et al., 2015; Kumar et al., 2015;
Mondal and Pai, 2014; Tang et al., 2016; Wang et al., 2015) and a
long list of references cited in Chen et al. (2015a), Du et al. (2014)
and many biomedicine and drug development areas (Chen et al.,
2016a; Zhong and Zhou, 2014; Zhou, 2015; Zhou and Zhong,
2016). Because it has been widely and increasingly used, recently
three powerful open access soft—wares, called ‘PseAAC—Builder’ (Du
et al., 2012), ‘propy’ (Cao et al., 2013) and ‘PseAAC—General’ (Du
et al., 2014), were established: the former two are for generating
various modes of Chou’s special PseAAC; while the third one for
those of Chou’s general PseAAC (Chou, 2011), including not only
all the special modes of feature vectors for proteins but also the
higher level feature vectors such as ‘Functional Domain’ mode
(Equations 9 and 10 of Chou, 2011), ‘Gene Ontology’ mode
(Equations 11 and 12 of Chou, 2011) and ‘Sequential Evolution’ or
‘PSSM’ mode (Equations 13 and 14 of Chou, 2011). Inspired by the
successes of using PseAAC to deal with protein/peptide sequences,
three web—servers (Chen et al., 2014, 2015b; Liu et al., 2015a) were
developed for generating various feature vectors for DNA/RNA se—
quences as well. Particularly, recently, a powerful web—server called
Pse—in—One (Liu et al., 2015b) has been developed that can be used
to generate any desired feature vectors for protein/peptide and
DNA/RNA sequences according to the need of users’ studies.

According to the general PseAAC (Chou, 2011), the peptide se—
quence of Equation 3 can be formulated as

PUK) = P+(K) — 1r (K): (5)
where

_ Pf13(R—13|R—12)
Pf12(R—12|R—11)

Pf2(R—2|R—1)

Pi1(R—1)
WK) = PI1(R+1) (6)
Piz(R+2|R+1)

P112(R+12|R+11)

 

 

_ P113(R+13|R+12) _

P;2(R+ZIR+1)

P112 (R+12 |R+11)
_ P113(R+13IR+12) _

 

 

In Equation 6, pf13(R_13|R_12) is the conditional probability of
amino acid R_13 occurring at the left first position (Equation 3)
given that its closest right neighbor is R_12, pf12(R_12|R_11) is the
conditional probability of amino acid R_12 occurring at the left se—
cond position given that its closest right neighbor is R_11, and so
forth. Note that in Equation 6, only pf1(R_1) and p:1(R+1) are of
non—conditional probability because the right neighbor of R_1 and
the left neighbor of R+1 are always K (Lys). All these probability val—
ues can be easily derived from the positive training subsets taken
from Supplementary Material, as done in Chou (1996). Likewise,
the components in Equation 7 are the same as those in Equation 6
except for that they are derived from the negative training subsets
taken from the same supporting information.

2.3 Ensemble random forest algorithm

The random forest (RF) algorithm is a powerful algorithm and has
been widely used in many areas of computational biology (Jia et al.,
2015a, b, 2016b, c, d; Kandaswamy et al., 2011; Lin et al., 2011;
Pugalenthi et al., 2012). The algorithm of RF is based on the ensem—
ble of a large number of decision trees, where each tree gives a classi—
fication and the forest chooses the final classification via the most
votes (over all the trees in the forest). In the most commonly used
type of RFs, split selection is performed based on the so—called de—
crease of Gini impurity. In this study, the RF is used to rank the fea—
tures using Gini importance that is implemented with the machine
learning platform scikit-learn. The detailed procedures of RF and its
formulation have been very clearly described in (Breiman, 2001),
and hence there is no need to repeat here.

In this study, however, the benchmark datasets are extremely
unbalanced. As we can see from Table 1, for the case of acetylation,
the number of positive samples is much larger than that of the nega—
tive ones. But for the case of crotonylation, methylation or succiny-
lation, the situation is just opposite: the number of positive samples
is much less than that of the negative ones. A predictor trained by a
very skewing dataset would inevitably yield many bias errors. To
deal with this problem, we resort to the asymmetric bootstrap ap—
proach, as described below.

From the four highly unbalanced benchmark datasets (Equation
2), we can construct a set of 4 X m balanced datasets by doing m
bagging cycles of randomly picking 2403 positive acetylation sam—
ples from S+(1), 115 negative crotonylation samples from S_(2),
127 negative methylation samples from S_(3), and 1169 negative

succinylation samples from S_(4), respectively. The 4 X m balanced
datasets thus obtained can be formulated by

negative subset S_(1) (see column 2 and row 4 of Table 1); SgootW)
(2) contains 115 positive samples for crotonylation, exactly the
same as the number of samples in S+(2); and so forth.

Now, based on the 4 X 5 = 20 balanced benchmark datasets in
Equation 8, we can establish four ensemble predictors by the fusion
approach (Chou and Shen, 2007b; Shen and Chou, 2007a), as for—
mulated by

RIFEU): RIF1(i)VRlF2(i)V-~VRIF5(2')2V521R1Fm(i), (9)

where i = 1, 2, 3, 4; RFE(1), RFEQ), RFE(3) and RFE(4) are the en-
semble predictors for identifying the acetylation, crotonylation,
methylation and succinylation sites, respectively. The symbol V de—
notes the fusing operator (Chou and Shen, 2007a), and RFMU) is an
individual RF predictor based on the benchmark dataset sﬁglg‘gggj,(i)
in Equation 8 with 150 trees for each of the individual predictors.
For more detailed about using the fusion approach to form an en—
semble predictor, see a comprehensive review (Chou and Shen,
2007a), where a crystal clear description with a set of elegant equa—
tions are given and hence there is no need to repeat here.

Finally, the results obtained by the four ensemble classifiers,
RFE(1), RFE(2), RFE(3) and RFE(4), will be subjected to a combin—
ation to display (1) whether the query sample can be of K—PTM, and
(2) what K—PTM type/types it can be of.

The predictor obtained thru the above procedures is called
iPTM—mLys, where ‘i’ stands for ‘identify’, ‘PTM’ for ‘post—transla—
tional modification’ and ‘mLys’ for ‘multiple lysine sites’.

To provide an intuitive picture, a ﬂowchart is given in Figure 1
to illustrate how the 4 X 5 = 20 individual RF predictors are fused

into four ensemble classifiers, and how their outputs are combined
to yield the final results.

3 Results and discussion

As mentioned in Section 1, among the five guidelines in developing a
useful predictor, one of them is how to objectively evaluate its antici—
pated success rates (Chou, 2011). To fulfil this, the following two things
need to consider: one is what metrics should be adopted to measure the
predictor’s quality; the other is what kind of test method should be used
to derive the metrics rates. Below, let us address such two problems

3.1 Metrics for measuring the prediction quality
of multi—Iabel systems
As shown in Supplementary Material and Table 1, we have a total of
6394 samples, of which 3991 are labeled with ‘acetylation’, 115 with
‘crotonylation’, 127 with ‘methylation’, 1 169 with ‘succinylation’ and
1,750 with ‘non—K—PTM’. Note that in the above samples, some have
two or more labels. Therefore, in the current study, we are dealing
with a multi—label system (Chou, 2013) and hence the conventional
metrics (Chen et al., 2013; Jia et al., 2016a; Lin et al., 2014; Xiao
et al., 2016) defined for single—label systems are no longer valid.
According to Chou’s formulation (Chou, 2013), the metrics for a
multi—label system can be formulated as

The above approach had been effectively used to study various
multi—label systems, such as those in which a protein may exist in
two or more different subcellular locations (Chou et al., 2011,
2012; Lin, et al., 2013; Wu et al., 2011, 2012; Xiao, et al., 2011), or
a membrane protein may have two or more different types (Huang
and Yuan, 2013), or an antimicrobial peptide may have two or
more different types (Xiao et al., 2013).

3.2 Cross—validation

With a set of multi—label metrics clearly defined, the next step is
what kind of validation method should be used to derive the metrics
values.

The following three cross—validation methods are often used in
literature: (i) independent dataset test, (ii) subsampling (or K—fold
cross—validation) test and (iii) jackknife test (Chou and Zhang,
1995). Of these three, however, the jackknife test is deemed the least
arbitrary that can always yield a unique outcome for a given bench—
mark dataset as elucidated in (Chou, 2011). Accordingly, the jack—
knife test has been widely recognized and increasingly used by
investigators to examine the quality of various predictors (Ahmad
et al., 2015; Chou and Cai, 2005; Dehzangi et al., 2015; Khan et al.,
2015; Kumar et al., 2015; Liu et al., 2015c; Nanni et al., 2014; Shen
and Chou 2007b; Zhou, 1998; Zhou and Doctor, 2003).

In this study, however, to reduce the computational time, we
adopted the 5—fold cross—validation method, as done by many inves—
tigators with SVM as the prediction engine.

The 5—fold cross—validation results obtained by the iPTM—mLys
on the benchmark dataset of Supplementary Material are given by

Aiming : 69.78%
Coverage : 74.54%

Accuracy : 68.37% (12)

Absolute—True : 60.92%
Absolute—False : 13.40%

indicating: (i) the rate of “Aiming” or “Precision” (Chou, 2013) is
69.78%, the average ratio of the predicted labels that hit the target of
the real labels; (ii) the rate of “Coverage” or “Recall” (Chou, 2013) is
74.54%, the average ratio of the real labels that are covered by the
hits of prediction; (iii) the rate of “Accuracy” is 68.37%, the average
ratio of the correctly predicted labels over the total labels including
correctly and incorrectly predicted ones as well as those real labels but
are missed out during the prediction; (iv) the rate of “Absolute—True”
is 60.92%, the average ratio of the perfectly correct hits over the total
prediction events and (v) the rate of “Absolute—False” or ‘Hamming—
Loss’ (Chou, 2013) is 13.40%, the average ratio of the completely
wrong hits over the total prediction events.

Since iPTM—mLys is the first multi—label predictor ever developed
for identifying multiple PTM sites in proteins, it is hard to

demonstrate its power by comparison with its counterparts for
exactly the same purpose. Nevertheless, we can show its power by a
comparison with some multi—label predictors in other areas via the
following analysis and discussion.

In Equations 10 and 12, the first four metrics are completely op—
posite to the last one. For the former, the higher the rate is, the bet—
ter the multi—label predictor’s performance will be; for the latter, the
lower the rate is, the better its performance will be.

Among the five metrics in Equation 10, the most strict and harsh
one is the ‘Absolute—True’. To our best knowledge, very few multi—
label predictors in biology could reach over 50% for the absolute
true rate. For example, iLoc-Animal, a very powerful multi-label
classifier for predicting subcellular localization of animal proteins
(Lin et al., 2013), its reported absolute—true rate was 45.62%. Also,
for iAMP-2L, a powerful two-level multi-label classifier for identify-
ing antimicrobial peptides and their functional types (Xiao et al.,
2013), its reported absolute—true rate was 43.05%. None of them
could reach even 5 0%; in contrast, the absolute—true rate achieved
by iPTM—mLys can reach over 60%, as shown in Equation 12.

Also, among the same five metrics, the most important is the
‘Accuracy’. According to the reports for iLoc-Animal (Lin et al.,
2013) and iAMP-2L (Xiao et al., 2013), their accuracy rates were
62.88% and 66.87%, respectively. In contrast, the accuracy rate
achieved by iPTM-mLys is 6 8.37%.

4 Web-server and user guide

To enhance the value of its practical applications, the web—server for
iPTM—mLys has been established. Furthermore, to maximize the
convenience of most experimental scientists, a step—by—step guide is
provided below.

Step 1. Opening the web—server at http://www.jci—bioinfo.cn/
iPTM-mLys, you will see the top page of iPTM-mLys on your com—
puter screen, as shown in Figure 2. Click on the Read Me button to
see a brief introduction about the predictor.

Step 2. Either type or copy/paste the query protein sequences
into the input box at the center of Figure 2. The input sequence
should be in the FASTA format. For the examples of sequences in
FASTA format, click the Example button right above the input box.

Step 3. Click on the Submit button to see the predicted result.
For instance, if you use the two query protein sequences as an in—

 

put, after 30 seconds or so since clicking the submit button, you’ll
see the following results popped on the screen. (1) Sequence—1
(Q16778) contains 20 K residues, of which the residues at the se—
quence position sites ‘6’, ‘12’, ‘16’, ‘17’, ‘21’ and ‘24’ can be of
both ‘Acetylation’ and ‘Crotonylation’; residue ‘58’ can be of both
‘Acetylation’ and ‘Methylation’; residues ‘35’ and ‘47’ can be of
both ‘Crotonylation’ and ‘Methylation’; residues ‘13’, ‘25’, ‘44’,
‘86’, ‘109’, ‘117’, ‘121’ and ‘126’ can be of only ‘Acetylation’;
while residues ‘28’, ‘29’ and ‘31’ can be none of the four PTM. (2)
Sequence—2 contains invalid character(s): ‘Check your input!’ For
facilitating comparison, both the predicted and experimental re—
sults for protein Q16778 are listed in Table 2. Substituting the con—
sistent and inconsistent scores between the prediction and
observation into Equation 10, we have the rates of
aiming 267.50%, coverage 265.00%, accuracy 262.50%, abso—
lute—true 255.00% and absolute—false:15.00%, quite similar to
the rates obtained by the cross—validation tests as given in
Equation 12.

Step 4. As shown on the lower panel of Figure 2, you may also
choose the batch prediction by entering your e—mail address and
your desired batch input file (in FASTA format of course) via the
‘Browse’ button. To see the sample of batch input file, click on the
button Batch—example.

Step 5. Click on the Citation button to find the relevant papers that
document the detailed development and algorithm of iPTM—mLys.

Step 6. Click the Supporting Information button to download

 

the benchmark dataset used to train and test the current predictor.

Note: To obtain the predicted result with the anticipated success
rate, the entire sequence of the query protein rather than its frag—
ment should be used as an input.

5 Conclusion

There are many existing computational predictors for identifying
the PTM sites in proteins; all of them are for the single-label PTM
systems but not for the multi—label ones. The iPTM-mLys presented
in this paper represents the first web—server ever established that can
be use to deal with both single— and multi—label PTM systems. It has
not escaped our notice that, similar to the current multi-label K-
PTM, the other PTM systems such as C—PTM, R—PTM and S—PTM
do also have their corresponding multi—label PTM sites at Cys, Arg
and Ser residues, respectively. Likewise, the approach and formula—
tions proposed in this article can be used to analyze them as well.

To maximize the users’ convenience, a step—by—step guide has
been provided, by which users can easily get their desired results
without the need to go through the complicated mathematical equa—
tions. Although the current iPTM—mLys predictor is limited to ana—
lyze the multi—label systems of four different K—PTM types, with
more experimental data available in future, we will update it with a
new version to cover more types as well, such as biotinylation,
butyrylation, propionylation and ubiquitination. By that time, an
announcement will be given in the website http://www.jci—bioinfo.

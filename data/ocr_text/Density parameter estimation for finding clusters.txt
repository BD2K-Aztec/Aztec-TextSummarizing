ABSTRACT

Motivation: Homology detection is a long-standing challenge in com-
putational biology. To tackle this problem, typically all-versus-all
BLAST results are coupled with data partitioning approaches resulting
in clusters of putative homologous proteins. One of the main prob-
lems, however, has been widely neglected: all clustering tools need a
density parameter that adjusts the number and size of the clusters.
This parameter is crucial but hard to estimate without gold standard
data at hand. Developing a gold standard, however, is a difficult and
time consuming task. Having a reliable method for detecting clusters
of homologous proteins between a huge set of species would open
opportunities for better understanding the genetic repertoire of bac-
teria with different lifestyles.

Results: Our main contribution is a method for identifying a suitable
and robust density parameter for protein homology detection without
a given gold standard. Therefore, we study the core genome of 89
actinobacteria. This allows us to incorporate background knowledge,
i.e. the assumption that a set of evolutionarily closely related species
should share a comparably high number of evolutionarily conserved
proteins (emerging from phylum-specific housekeeping genes). We
apply our strategy to find genes/proteins that are specific for certain
actinobacterial lifestyles, i.e. different types of pathogenicity. The
whole study was performed with transitivity clustering, as it only
requires a single intuitive density parameter and has been shown to
be well applicable for the task of protein sequence clustering. Note,
however, that the presented strategy generally does not depend on
our clustering method but can easily be adapted to other clustering
approaches.

1 INTRODUCTION

Finding clusters of homologous proteins, i.e. clusters containing
only paralogous and orthologous proteins, is a long-standing
bioinformatics challenge in the post-genome era. Searching the
exact phrase “homology detection’ with PubMed leads to
174 hits. The group of Peer Bork published one of the first
review articles on “Predicting functions from protein sequences’
as early as 1998 (Bork and Koonin, 1998). The availability of
next-generation sequencing technology provided us with almost
2000 whole-genome sequences, scattered over all domains of life
(Sayers et al., 2011). The annotation of the emerging sequences is
difﬁcult, error prone and impossible to perform in the wet 1a-
boratory for each gene/protein of each organism individually
without appropriate bioinformatics software (Blanco and
Abril, 2009; Tcherepanov et al., 2006). To date, we have more
than 5 million bacterial sequenced genes available for download
from the National Center for Biotechnology Information
(NCBI) database (Sayers et al., 2011).

The usual starting point is a pairwise similarity matrix given by
local alignment tools, such as Basic Local Alignment Search
Tool (BLAST) (Altschul et al., 1997), that assigns each pair of
proteins a similarity value. Afterwards, we pipe this data into
clustering tools, i.e. computational methods for partitioning
data objects into groups such that the objects share common
traits, which have been measured with the similarity function
(Hartigan, 1975). Over the past years, many tools have been
developed for this purpose. Andreopoulos et a]. (2009) outline
further biological application areas. For protein homology
detection, the following tools have proven useful, and their ac-
curacy is well studied: k-means, affinity propagation, Markov
clustering and FORCE, as well as transitivity clustering (TC)
(Enright et al., 2002; Enright and Ouzounis, 2000; Frey and
Dueck, 2007; Paccanaro et al., 2006; Wittkop et al., 2010).

Although most research concentrated on developing new more
sophisticated data partitioning methods, one of the major prob-
lems has been widely neglected: all clustering tools need a (set of)
density parameter(s) that adjust the number and the size of the
clusters. A clustering tool cannot ‘know’ a priori if we seek to find
protein families (restrictive parameters) or protein superfamilies
(weak parameters), for instance. Although these parameters are
crucial they are hard to estimate without gold standard data at

hand. Furthermore, it is difﬁcult and time consuming to deﬁne a
good gold standard, which consequently limits us to a small
number of proteins from a limited number of organisms.

Clusters of homologous proteins across a number of organ-
isms allow for studying lifestyle-speciﬁc genetic repertoires, i.e.
the genes that have homologous counterparts in all organisms or
in a speciﬁc set of organisms. Such studies can lead, for instance,
to the discovery of mutual proteins shared only among patho-
genic strains of a certain phyla, thus suggesting new drug targets
and wet laboratory candidates for vaccine design. The quality of
such studies is highly dependent on the quality of the clustering
process and consequently dependent on the choice of the clus-
tering method and a good estimate of the density parameter(s).

In this study, we present a robust method for selecting a suit-
able density parameter for TC for the task of protein homology
detection. TC is a clustering method that has been shown to
perform well when trying to identify protein families and protein
superfamilies based on sequence similarity. Using all protein se-
quences from 89 actinobacteria, we build our method upon two
assumptions: (i) clusters of size equal to the number of input
organisms (here 89) are likely to contain housekeeping genes
and thus should be over-represented, and (2) clusters greater
than the number of input organisms are more likely to contain
many false positives (non-homologous genes). Maximizing
(i) while minimizing (ii) allows us to estimate a meaningful
threshold for discovering clusters of homologous proteins with-
out manually curated gold standard associations for any of the
>300 000 proteins. Given this threshold, we compute and analyze
the core genome of the 89 actinobacteria. We further divide them
into four different groups of pathogenicity: non-pathogens
(NPs), human pathogens (HPs), animal pathogens (APs) and
opportunistic pathogens (OPS) (Supplementary Table S1). We
then study the class-speciﬁc genetic repertoire of the 89
actinobacteria.

The phylum actinobacteria is one of the biggest clades of bac-
teria. Their members show a high diversity throughout different
lifestyles and can cope with a variety of different habitats (Miao
and Davies, 2010). Many of these bacteria are important for
biotechnological production processes, as well as human and
animal medicine (Ventura et al., 2007). Here, we focus on
selected species of the following so-called CMNR group: cory-
nebacteria, mycobacteria, nocardia and rhodococcus. Our main
motivation for this study and our main focus of attention are the
Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis. It causes caseous lymph-
adenitis in animals (\Nilliamson, 2001), with dramatic effects
on livestock all over the world. All CMNR organisms selected
for this study share common properties with impact on the
design of effective vaccinations; they all share a common cell
wall organization (Dorella et al., 2006), for instance. For vaccine
design, accurate homology information about the protein space
in this group is important, e.g. for reducing drug target side ef-
fects and negative effects on the other microorganisms that are
part of the host’s microbiome.

There have been several studies about the actinobacterial
evolution [refer to Gao and Gupta (2012a)]. Most of them con-
centrated on phylogenetic tree reconstruction solely based on the
DNA sequence information of the 16S RNA. Despite the many
advantages of this method, it cannot provide insights into the
evolutionary relationship on a species level (Stackebrandt, 2009).

Gao and Gupta (2012b) used only a limited dataset of only a few
genes that were expected to be conserved along the phylum for
phylogenetic tree reconstruction. In several recent studies, best
bidirectional hits from genome-wide all-versus-all BLAST results
of all genes were used for homology detection [Karberg et a].
(2011) or Gao et a]. (2006), for instance]. This strategy, however,
neglects the impact of careful BLAST cutoff evaluation, as well
as the effect of transitive dependencies in the similarity function.
Gene A may be similar to gene B, which is similar to gene C, but
gene C is not similar to gene A. These problem instances can be
‘repaired’ with clustering tools, such as TC (\Nittkop et al.,
2011a). However, the problem of ﬁnding a reasonable density
parameter remains with TC, as well as with any other clustering
method.

In the following section, we brieﬂy describe the actinobacterial
dataset used. Afterwards, we give a short introduction to TC
followed by our main contribution: a robust method for estimat-
ing a meaningful similarity threshold (TC’s density parameter).
We will describe how we study the robustness of our approach.
We further support our strategy by computing a revised phylo-
genetic tree based on the whole genetic repertoire of the 89 acti-
nobacteria. We will discuss our results and present core genomes
speciﬁc to the four aforementioned pathogenicity classes.

2 METHODS

2.1 Data sources

We obtained the protein sequences in FASTA format from
NCBI (Sayers et al., 2011) for the 89 sequenced and annotated
actinobacteria of the CMNR group. See Supplementary Table
S1 for a list of all species and a classiﬁcation into the four patho-
gencity classes. We also give the associated disease where avail-
able. Our dataset comprises 344421 proteins of 89 species: 27
corynebacteria, 55 mycobacteria, 6 rhodococcus and 1 nocardia.

2.2 Transitivity clustering

We decided to use TC (W ittkop et al., 2010) for this study for the
following reasons: (i) It has proven to be a well-performing clus-
tering tool for biological data in general and for protein sequence
clustering in particular. (ii) TC requires only a single intuitive
parameter to control cluster sizes and numbers. (iii) TC is com-
parably robust against noise in the data [Wittkop et al. (2011b)
and Wittkop et a]. (2010)]. (iv) The runtime and memory efﬁ-
ciency of TC allows for an evaluation of hundreds of thousands
of sequences for varying parameter settings easily. Here, point
(ii) is striking. In contrast to other more complicated clustering
tools, with TC, we are not required to optimize two or more such
parameters but only a single one. Note that our parameter esti-
mation method would work with other clustering tools, even
though the traversal over the parameter setting space can be
more runtime intense.

First, we need to obtain a pairwise similarity measure for all
protein sequences. The canonical way to archive a similarity be-
tween two proteins is using the —1og10 of the BLAST E—value.
Therefore, we performed a BLAST all-versus-all on all amino
acid sequences using an E—value cutoff of 0.01. TC considers this
input as a graph, with proteins being the nodes and the simila-
rities being weighted edges. A11 edges below the given threshold

(TC’s density parameter) are removed from the graph; all others
we keep. By solving the weighted transitive graph projection
problem, TC converts that graph into a transitive graph with
the least edit costs. As edit costs, we use the accumulated differ-
ences between the similarities of the modiﬁed edges and the simi-
larity threshold. The resulting fully connected cliques represent
the ﬁnal clusters and are reported as result set. For a more
detailed description, please refer to Rahmann et a]. (2007). We
study the clustering result sets of TC runs for thresholds ranging
from 8 to 100, corresponding to BLAST E—values of l - 10—8 and
l - 10—100, respectively. We are conﬁdent that this range covers
all meaningful thresholds.

2.3 Threshold estimation

To reasonably investigate the clustering results, the density par-
ameter has to be set correctly such that most of the clusters
actually contain groups of homologous proteins. In our study
with >300 000 proteins from 89 different bacteria, we do not
have a given gold standard that would allow us to ﬁnd a reliable
threshold. We will present an approach that only uses intrinsic
indirect information of the dataset to determine such a threshold.

In what follows, n denotes the number of species. This
number, i.e. 11:89 in our study, is constant and independent
on the chosen threshold. Our ﬁrst assumption is based on the
expectation of observing signiﬁcantly more clusters of size n than
clusters of other sizes, as housekeeping genes and essential genes
are expected to be conserved across all bacteria. Thus, they are
more likely to cluster together in a group of exactly (or almost
exactly) 89 proteins. In our analysis, we observed a peak in the
cluster size distribution (Fig. l) at 11:89, with most of these
clusters containing exactly one protein from each of the 89 or-
ganisms. This gives evidence in favor of our ﬁrst assumption.
Setting the clustering threshold such that we maximize the size
(height) of this peak would increase the number of allowed
housekeeping gene. However, on the other hand, we cannot
assess the number of false positives in these clusters directly, as
we do not have a given reliable gold standard. What we require

Cluster size

Fig. 1. Cluster size distribution of the 89 actinobacteria for similarity
threshold 48. Arrow (A) highlights the core gnome peak at cluster
size 89. These peaks in area (B) represent more speciﬁc core genomes,
for example, all mutual proteins of the different mycobacteria/corynebac-
teria strains. The beginning of the unspeciﬁc clusters is marked by
arrow (C)

is a second measure for allowing us to minimize these false
positives. Here, our second assumption is used: clusters with
larger sizes (far bigger than n proteins) are likely to contain
non-homologous proteins (i.e. false positives). The more a cluster
size exceeds n, the more unlikely it is that this increase can be
explained by true-positive paralogous proteins. We will use this
assumption to receive a measure for handling the number of false
positives.

Put in other words, our strategy is to vary the similarity thresh-
old such that our TC-based clustering results yields the following
two optimizations:

(1) Maximize the number of clusters of size n (most likely
containing common housekeeping genes).

(2) Minimize number of large clusters (most likely containing
many false positives).

To account for the ﬁrst problem, we have to separate the
desired peak from the background distribution to get the relative
peak height compared with the surrounding area. The cluster
size distribution seems to follow a power law. For that reason,
we learned the best ﬁtting discrete power-law:

x—Ot

P05,xmin(x) :  x ‘ )9

with {(05, xmm) being Rieman’s Zeta function for the background
distribution using the python tools provided in Clauset et a].
(2007). Figure 1 depicts the cluster size distribution and the best
ﬁt power law for threshold 48 (we will explain below why we
picked 48). Let 0?, and 32mm), be the approximated parameters
for the best ﬁtting power law for the cluster size distribution
D,(x) for threshold t. The function Dt(x) gives the absolute
number of clusters of size x. Furthermore, m, denotes the
number of observations, i.e. the total number of clusters, again
for threshold t. We now deﬁne the relative peak height h,(x) as:

ht(x) = Dt(x) — P&,,£m,-,,,,(X) ' mt:

where Pogbgmwa) - m, denotes the expected number of observa-
tion of a perfect power law of the given sample size m,, as
Pogbgmwa) is a probability function. In the following, we refer
to the relative core genome height h,(n) as [1,.

Selecting the best threshold by optimizing only for h, would
lead to a weak threshold, as it would favor thresholds ‘ﬁlling up’
many of small clusters such that they contain n proteins in the
end. To address this issue, we need to penalize the occurrence of
unrealistic large clusters (false positives). In this work, we deﬁne
such a cluster as a cluster containing >l.5 - n proteins. It is un-
likely, that there are clusters of that size containing only real
homologous and functional identical proteins because our acti-
nobacterial dataset is diverse. A ‘real’ cluster of size 1.5 - n would
imply that at least half of the species must have undergone the
same duplication event. That means this duplication event most
likely happened at an evolutionary early time point in their
common ancestor. On the other hand, the genetic variation
was small enough such that these paralogous proteins still
belong to the same cluster of homologous proteins. If that
would happen to be a common case, one would also expect
core genome peaks for paralogous proteins, e.g. at 211 or
3 -n. We were not able to identify such a peak for any of the
similarity thresholds. In conclusion, a cutoff for unrealistic big

cluster at 1.5 - n is reasonable, and the accidental punishment of
real paralogous clusters is negligible. Thus, we deﬁne the number
of unrealistic clusters at for threshold t as:

“t = Z Dt(x)

;.
x>2n

Optimizing only for that measure in turn would decrease the
number of false positives but would increase the number of false
negatives, i.e. homologous proteins put into two different clus-
ters. Thus, in a ﬁnal step, we combine both quality measures to a
single overall quality value that we can assign to the TC results
for the varying thresholds. As h, and u, are two completely dif-
ferent measures, we scale them to the range [0, l], with T being
the set of all used thresholds:

h/ _ ht — min(hi,  E 7-)
t _ max(h,-,Vi e T) — min(h,-,Vi E T)

 

u, u, — min(u,,Vi E T)
’ max(u,-,Vi e T) — min(u,-,Vi E T)

 

We calculate our ﬁnal quality measure Q(t) as the harmonic
mean of both of them:

7/. + (1 — 2)

We are using (1 — u’t) such that lower numbers of unrealistic
clusters result in the better quality measures. We may now use
this approach to ﬁnd that similarity threshold t of TC, which
gives the best quality measure Q(t). Figure 2 plots Q(t) for several
TC results for threshold ranging from 8 to 100.

2.4 Robustness analysis

So far, we have derived a quality measure Q(t) using only
intrinsic information of the provided dataset. On the other
hand, actinobacteria are known to be diverse, suggesting that
our dataset is biased. For example, we have 35 different strains
of M ycobacterium tuberculosis, which are all likely to be more
similar to each other than to the other actinobacteria. To respect
for this potential bias, we split our datasets to investigate the
stability of our approach. The following datasets were created:

0 Myco-Only: all organisms of the genus mycobacteria (here:
55 species).

0 Coryne-Only: same as Myco-Only but with all corynebac—
teria (here: 27 species).

0 Rand-20: here, we randomly selected 20 of the 89 species
without replacement. We created 20 such datasets, to get an
impression of the variability of our approach.

As expected, our approach is limited by the level of biological
diversity among the studied organisms. Although the actinoba-
cerial phylum already is diverse, we also selected a dataset con-
sisting of 40 different proteobacteria. Proteobacteria resemble
one of the largest bacterial phyla with a huge genetic diversity
(Stackebrandt et al., 1988). In the remainder of this manuscript,
we will call this the Proteo dataset. With Proteo, we aim to assess
the stability and the limits of our approach for more diverse
genomes. We used the protein sequences of 10 bacteria of
each of the following four proteobacterial subgroups: alphapro-
teobacteria, betaproteobacteria, gammaproteobacteria and the

Fig. 2. In this ﬁgure, we plot our quality measure against the similarity threshold of TC. The red plot represents the quality measure Q(t) for the entire
dataset and the blue box-and-whisker plot in the background represents the variance and mean of all Rand-20 datasets (see text). The green and orange
lines plot the quality measure for the Coryne—Only and the Myco-Only dataset respectively (see text). The three boxes in the plot mark the pick range,
i.e. that range of thresholds where we see 10% of the best quality hits Q(t). For the two rather phylum-biased datasets, i.e. Myco-Only and Coryne—Only,
the pick range is larger than the pick range of the entire dataset. Notably, the pick range for the entire dataset is completely contained in the pick range
of both, the Myco-Only and the Coryne—Only datasets. The gray line indicates the quality measure for the Proteo dataset. This dataset is too diverse for
the presented quality measure, which is indicated by the generally lower quality values and the shifted box toward a weak threshold. The dotted red line
indicates the threshold 48, which was chosen for the core genome analysis (see text)

delta/epsilon subdivisions (40 genomes in total). Please refer to
Supplementary Table S2 for a detailed description. As we only
use intrinsic information ‘hidden’ in the dataset, we rely on a
certain level of homogeneity among the genomes to receive a
reasonably large ‘core-genome peak’. Hence, we may expect a
slightly lower quality measures for the more diverse Proteo data-
set highlighting the limits of our approach.

2.5 The actinobacterial phylogenetic tree

Given a meaningful clustering of homologous proteins, we may
now calculate an interspecies similarity. Let 0 = {01, . . . , on} be
the set of n organisms with 0,- : {p,-1, ...,p,-,,,.} as a set of n,-
different proteins. Furthermore, let C = {C1, ...,cm} be the set
of m clusters. Furthermore, we deﬁne 601(0),) to be the number of
proteins that organism 0,- has in cluster ck. The function

6 _ 0 if 601(0),) 2 0 v 601(0),) 2 0
0":01' (Ck) _ 601(0),) + 601(0),) otherwise

denotes the number of mutual proteins in cluster ck of organisms
0,- and oj if both organisms are represented by at least one pro-
tein. The similarity function s(0,-, 0]) between two organisms 0,-
and oj is now deﬁned as:

Z 601'501' (Ci)

ciEC

“Ob 01') = W
0i Oj

This is basically the number of all mutual proteins of 0,- and
oj scaled with the total number of proteins of both species. This
scaling is done to prevent a bias of the similarity toward species
with larger genomes (more genes).

These interspecies similarities fulﬁll all properties for a
similarity function required for TC. To create a phylogenetic
tree, we ran TransClust in hierarchical mode with option
‘top-down’. Set in hierarchical mode, TransClust starts with a
low threshold that is increased over several iterations. As result,
in the ﬁrst iteration, we obtain one big cluster containing all
species. With more restrictive thresholds, the cluster(s) are
divided into smaller clusters until each species ends in its own
singelton cluster. The clustering result of all iterations is used to
generate a phylogenetic tree. This tree is now based on the
whole-genome repertoire of all actinobacteria. Note that we con-
struct this (simple) tree for supporting our threshold estimation
procedure, rather than introducing a new phylogenetic tree
reconstruction methodology. One could also use other phylogen-
etic tree reconstruction approaches that are based on pairwise
similarity functions.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Threshold estimation

First, we will discuss the evaluation of the threshold estimation
method. Figure 2 illustrates the stability of our approach.
In particular, the results of the 20 randomly sampled Rand-20
datasets are a good indicator for the reliability of our approach
(refer to Table 1).

We deﬁne a threshold pick range RD 2 {t,, . . . , tk} as the set of
all thresholds, where the quality measure Q(t) exceeds 90% of the
best threshold of dataset D, i.e. that similarity threshold area

Table 1. This table shows the exact values for the evaluation of the

for the entire dataset, subdivided into a column showing the quality measure [‘Q(t)’]
and column ‘A’ displays the percentage deviation of ‘Q(t)’ from ‘u(Q(t))’.

where we ﬁnd 10% of the best results. The pick ranges for the
different datasets are marked with a box in Figure 2. For the
complete dataset, we observe a pick range of RAH = {35, . . . , 48}.
In this range, the SD of the 20 Rand-20 datasets is only ~3%
from the mean.

As we expected, the Proteo dataset (gray line) shows a lower
quality Q(t) than the actinobacterial dataset(s). We also observe
a left-shifted pick range, i.e. toward a lower threshold, resulting
in a less rigorous homology detection. The main reason for that
is the smaller size of the proteobacterial core genome. This indi-
cates that a single threshold for all species, ignoring the level or
diversity, cannot sufﬁciently be detected, and, for instance, the
alphaproteobacteria should be investigated separately from the
betaprotebacteria.

We now discuss the Myco-Only dataset. The quality measure
is better than for the other datasets, and the pick range is larger
(the range of suitable similarity thresholds is bigger). This is
mainly contributed to 35 strains of M .tuberculosis in a dataset
with a total of only 55 species. As the different strains of
M.tuberculosis are closely related, there is less variance in the
clustering result with respect to the threshold. In other words,
the proteins of the core genome cluster together early (for weaker
thresholds), and variance only occurs for the less similar proteins
of the non-tuberculosis species. Therefore, the relative core
genome peak height stays pretty stable for more thresholds.

We suggest that all thresholds from the pick range are good
candidates. We decided to choose the most restrictive one, i.e. 48,
to further reduce the possibility of false positives in the homology
detection and thus enhance the conﬁdence in the presented
actinobacterial core genome. We marked this threshold with a
dashed line in Figure 2.

3.2 Pathogenicity as a genetic model

In this ﬁrst application of our previously obtained clusters of
homologous proteins, we study the relationship between the gen-
etic repertoire and bacterial lifestyles, pathogenicity classes in our
case. In particular, we are looking for genes that we ﬁnd exclu-
Sively in a certain class of species, pathogens, for instance. Most
likely, those genes would be conserved across several different
pathogenic phyla and thus build a cluster that contains no
proteins from NP organism. In the following, we work with
the TC clusters that we obtained by using the conservative
threshold of 48, estimated as described earlier. In the following,
we will distinguish between four different types of pathogenicity:

o HPS (44 bacteria),
0 APS (10 bacteria),
0 OPS (23 bacteria),
0 NPS (12 bacteria).

Note that OPS are generally not infectious but normally act
commensal and do not harm the host. However, they can cause
diseases in the case of a weak host’S (immune) resistance (Rogers,
1963). Figure 3 depictS distributions of the cluster Size overlaps
between different combinations of the pathogenicity classes.
Furthermore, we provide datasets containing all Speciﬁc core
genomes, the general core genome and all possible combinations,
for example, clusters containing only proteins from HP and AP
but not from OP and NP. These datasets are diSjoint, e.g. the
combined core genome of HP and AP doeS not contain the
only-HP and only-AP clusters.

Some clusters were bigger than the number of SpecieS. Hence,
some SpecieS must contribute with two or more proteins. That
can happen by meanS of gene duplication eventS or because of
clustering mistakes, i.e. false positives in the homology detection.
Therefore, we provide the core genome datasets in two different
‘ﬂavorS’:

o Optimistic: all clusters with three or more proteins (includes
paralogs).

o Conservative: only those clusters from the optimistic, where
the number of proteinS equals the number of involved
SpecieS (no paralogs).

The general core genome includes only those clusters where all
89 SpecieS are involved. In the conservative case, these clusters
are additionally limited to a Size of exactly 89 proteins.

Figure 4 depictS a Venn diagram containing the number of
clusters in the different categories. Of particular interest are
‘distinctive clusterS’, which lack participating organisms of at
least one type of pathogenicity. ThuS, the core genome and all
other clusters containing proteins of SpecieS of NP, HP, AP and
OP are not on that list because they do not provide information on
how to separate the different typeS of pathogenicity. One can
clearly observe a connection between HPS and APS. A total of
1685 of 2888 HP and 3010 AP distinctive clusters are Shared,
which account for more of half of the respective distinctive clusters
in HP and AP. In contrast to thiS, only 646 distinctive clusters
contain proteins from HP and NP, and even less, 587, are con-
served across AP and NP. The OPS seem to be less Speciﬁc, aS they
overlap well distributed with all other categories (HP:1890, AP:

Fig. 3. Pathogenicity-Speciﬁc cluster Size distribution. The top picture, for
example, represents on the x-axis all pathogens and on the y-axis only
NPS. The colors encode the number of clusters that contain x ‘x-axis-ty-
pe-pathogenic’ and y ‘y-axiS-type-pathogenic’ Species. We count each Spe-
cies only once (no paralogs). The core genome can be found in the
top-right corner, whereas the top-left and bottom-right corners represent
the exclusive core genomes. There are no peaks in the latter two areas,
which means that there are no proteins that uniquely distinguish between
the two pathogenicity classes. The heat maps for the remaining combin-
ations can be downloaded form the web site of this article. Please note the
log-scale of the color range

1820 and NP: 2250). All these results are based on the conservative
core genome with TC threshold 48, although a Similar tendency
can be observed in the optimistic case (data not Shown). Although
our results do not totally fulﬁll our hope of seeing 100% patho-
genicity claSS-Speciﬁc proteins, our ﬁndingS clearly indicate a
certain genetic divergence between the pathogenicity lifestyles.

Fig. 4. These Venn diagrams depict the number of Shared clusters in each
possible intersection of the four different kinds of pathogenicity with at
least three proteins (for conservative and optimistic; see text). These inter-
sections are disjoint; for example, the intersection of the non-pathogenic
core genome and the human pathogenic core genome does not contain
the human-pathogenic-only clusters. The core genome contains all clus-
ters, which contain proteins of all Species. We marked the NP/HP/AP/
OP-only clusters and the core genome itself with bold font; for an inter-
section of two areas, we used italic font

3.3 Quality of the homology detection

AS already mentioned, there iS no gold standard for our bacteria.
ThiS poseS problems for asseSSing the appropriateness of cluster-
ing methods for homology detection. Although Slightly beyond
the scope of thiS study, we like to discuSS the agreement of our
results with existing prediction-based homology repositories,
EggNOG (Powell et al., 2012) and the Ortholog Matrix Project
(OMA) (DeSSimoz et al., 2005), for instance. OMA haS the lar-
gest number of common SpecieS with our study and waS Shown
to perform well (DeSSimoz et al., 2006) on thiS taSk. We mapped
118000 proteins of 30 SpecieS (9 corynebacteria, l7 mycobac-
teria, l nocardia and 3 rhodococcuS) against our actinobacterial
dataset by their IDS and their sequences. Please refer to
Supplementary Table S2 for a list of mapped proteins and Spe-
cieS. Finally, we removed all unmapped proteins from both acti-
nobacterial datasets.

To asseSS the agreement of both datasets, i.e. our with that of
OMA, we used the F-measure [a harmonic mean between preci-
Sion and recall; see e.g. Wittkop et al. (2011a)]. The F-measure
ranges between 0 and l, where 1 means perfect agreement be-
tween both datasets.

We now varied the TC threshold and compared the results
against OMA by uSing the F-measure to asseSS the agreement be-
tween both results setS (see Fig. 5). For the best threshold(S), the
F-measure of 0.7 iS good. Most notably, however, iS the observa-
tion that the F-measure iS best for thresholds ahnost exactly within
the pick range that waS suggested by our method (between 35 and
48). AS with thiS article, we particularly f ocuS on detecting a mean-
ingful threshold, i.e. denSity parameter, for clustering algorithms
(rather than studying the performance of clustering algorithms for
homology detection in general); thiS observation further strength-
enS our main conclusion. Furthermore, it would be hard to make a
qualiﬁed statement about the quality of OMA compared with
ourS, aS both methods are based on computer predictions.

3.4 The actinobacterial phylogenetic tree

We used our aforementioned interspecies Similarity to perform a
hierarchical clustering. With thiS, we were able to construct a

Fig. 5. Agreement with the OMA homology detection tool. Depicted is
the development of the F-measure as a function of the clustering thresh-
old. The red box marks the pick range derived by using our model Q(t).
Remarkably, the best F-measures (agreements with OMA) are achieved
for clustering results with thresholds in pick range that we suggested using
our method. The red dotted line indicates the threshold 48

phylogentic tree based on the whole-genome repertoire of all
the 89 actinobacteria. Supplementary Figure S1 depictS the
resulting tree. Whenever a cluster iS Split into subclusterS, with
increasing threshold, we branch in the tree accordingly. If a cluS-
ter stickS together for x decreasing thresholds, we set the length
of the branch to log(x + 1). This iS necessary mainly for optical
reasons because some closely related organisms stick together for
many threshold, which would result in long branches. One can
see that most of the mycobacteria cluster together, whereas the
other CMNR groups are Slightly more separated. ThiS observa-
tion iS reasonable, given the different lifestyles, and waS previ-
ously reported in other studies, see the review from Ventura et a].
(2007), for instance. We emphasize that thiS tree iS supposed to
support our threshold estimation procedure, rather than intro-
ducing a new method for phylogenetic tree reconstruction.

4 CONCLUSION

To sum up, we studied the actinobacterial genetic repertoire
with reSpect to four pathogenicity lifestyles. We used BLAST
and TC for thiS purpose. Here, our main novel contribution
waS the estimation of a robust Similarity threshold for TC.
Therefore, we set the denSity such that we balance the Size of
the core genome (number of clusters with exactly 89 genes/pro-
teinS; putative true positives) and the number of unreasonably
larger clusters (putative false positives) based on the cluster Size
distribution. We studied the robustness of our method by uSing
random sampling and achieve stable and reasonable core gen-
omeS for Similarity thresholds between 35 and 48. We receive
Similar results for the exclusive repertoire of the corynebacteria
and mycobacteria, respectively. In conclusion, our results suggest
that we may use the intrinSic information contained in the cluster
Size distribution, at least in the phylum actinobacteria, to deduce
a reasonable denSity parameter for robust and accurate protein

homology clustering. For future work with bacterial genomes,
we suggest uSing BLAST E—valueS between 10‘35 (optimistic)
and 10‘48 (conservative) when uSing bidirectional BLAST hitS
only for homology detection. Remarkably, the same range iS also
suggested by comparing the agreement of our clustering result
with the results from the OMA project.

Our method, however, iS limited by the level of biological
diversity among the set of SpecieS to be studied. AS we only
use the intrinsic information that iS ‘hidden’ in the dataset, we
rely on a certain level of homogeneity. Hence, we can expect a
reduced accuracy for more diverse setS of genomes.

Here, we applied the methods to prokaryoteS only. To use
eukaryotic genomes, some adaptionS would be necessary.
Mainly, the factor that deﬁneS the number of false positives
(unrealistically large clusters) must account for the fact that
eukaryoteS underwent more duplication eventS. We would sug-
gest the training of thiS parameter against a small gold standard.

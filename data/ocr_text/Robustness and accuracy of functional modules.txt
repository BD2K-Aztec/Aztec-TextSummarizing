ABSTRACT

Motivation: High-throughput molecular data provide a wealth of
information that can be integrated into network analysis. Several
approaches exist that identify functional modules in the context of
integrated biological networks. The objective of this study is 2-fold:
first, to assess the accuracy and variability of identified modules
and second, to develop an algorithm for deriving highly robust and
accurate solutions.

Results: In a comparative simulation study accuracy and robustness
of the proposed and established methodologies are validated,
considering various sources of variation in the data. To assess this
variation, we propose a jackknife resampling procedure resulting in
an ensemble of optimal modules. A consensus approach summarizes
the ensemble into one final module containing maximally robust
nodes and edges. The resulting consensus module identifies and
visualizes robust and variable regions by assigning support values
to nodes and edges. Finally, the proposed approach is exemplified
on two large gene expression studies: diffuse large B-cell lymphoma
and acute lymphoblastic leukemia.

1 INTRODUCTION

Multiple genome—scale datasets nowadays allow to model the cell as
an intricate network of molecular interactions. Research in systems
biology has changed accordingly, now focusing on network analysis
of high—throughput genome—, transcriptome— and proteome data.
Reaching beyond the analysis of mere topological questions,
integrated network analysis incorporates additional molecular data
into a network. For gene expression data integrated approaches are
used to search for pathways, functional modules or gene signatures
containing differentially expressed genes in the context of gene
networks or protein—protein interaction (PPI) networks (Dittrich
et al., 2008; Ideker et al., 2002; Scott et al., 2006; Ulitsky and
Shamir, 2007). Given the integrated gene expression data, the

objective is to ﬁnd the maximal signiﬁcantly deregulated (i.e.
differentially expressed) set of interconnected genes in the cellular
network. We refer to the resulting connected subnetwork as a
functional module, which is also denoted as active or perturbed
module (Ideker et al., 2002). Please note that this is in contrast to
other ﬁelds in biology (e. g. proteomics), where functional modules
denote protein complexes (Pu et al., 2007).

Various methods have been proposed to identify functional
modules in an integrated network. In this study we focus on
the popular approaches proposed by Ideker et al. (2002), Ulitsky
and Shamir (2007) and Dittrich et al. (2008). Although these
algorithms differ in many important aspects, conceptually they all
aim at identifying connected subnetworks that contain signiﬁcantly
deregulated genes. Ideker et al. (2002) introduced the problem and
proposed a simulated annealing approach to identify subnetworks.
Due to the heuristic nature of such sampling approaches, the
resulting modules are not optimal in general. In an alternative
approach Ulitsky et al. (2010) propose the algorithm DEGAS
(Dyergulated Gene set Analysis via Subnetworks), based on a
greedy approximation to identify subnetworks of dysregulated
genes. In contrast to the above mentioned approaches, the algorithm
of Dittrich et al. (2008) identiﬁes optimally scoring subnetworks
using an exact algorithm based on integer linear programming (ILP).

Besides the accuracy of a module identiﬁcation method, the
robustness of obtained solutions is of particular importance. A
natural question is: How variable are the provided solutions (given
the method)? A highly variable method produces largely differing
solutions in different runs or on slightly perturbed input data and is
thus less reliable. Clearly, well designed algorithms should ideally
show both: high accuracy as well as high robustness. Here we
investigate the accuracy and robustness of the three prominent
module detection algorithms regarding (i) the integrated gene
expression data and (ii) the network structure of the PPI network
itself.

As a consequence of the investigation we propose a novel method
to calculate accurate as well as robust modules in which robust
parts are indicated by support values, introducing the new concept
of consensus modules. In phylogeny, Felsenstein (1985) introduced
resampling approaches (e.g. bootstrap and jackknife) to deﬁne a
conﬁdence measure for splits in a phylogenetic tree and to calculate
consensus trees. Similarly, resampling procedures can be used to
assess the robustness of functional modules in integrated network
analysis. We use the delete—half jackknife (Felsenstein, 2004) to

resample the input microarray data and construct a set of resulting
modules. The consensus module summarizes the obtained modules
as one highly accurate and robust module with support values
assigned to its nodes and edges. For this purpose we extend the
existing exact approach of Dittrich et al. (2008) from a purely node—
based optimization to a node— and edge—based optimization problem.
Although this extension might be useful in various applications in
network analysis, we ﬁrst use this extension to deﬁne and calculate
the consensus network. The major beneﬁt of this procedure is 2—
fold: ﬁrst, we identify the optimal accurate as well as optimal robust
module. Second, we analyze and visualize the inner structure of the
identiﬁed module by assigning support values to both nodes and
edges.

The outline of the article is as follows: we ﬁrst investigate the
robustness of obtained solutions by comparing our approach to
other methods in a simulation framework. Therefore, we evaluate
the resulting modules in terms of accuracy and variability using
integrated microarray data, perturbed integrated data and perturbed
interaction networks as different sources of variability. To assess
and quantify the method—independent variability of the modules
(by assigning support values) we introduce a novel consensus
algorithm based on a resampling procedure. Finally, we apply
the consensus approach to two experimental datasets: microarray
proﬁles regarding acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and diffuse
large B—cell lymphoma (DLBCL).

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

2.1 Gene expression and network data

PPI data from HPRD human protein reference database; (Mishra et al., 2006)
were used, constituting a network of 9386 proteins and 36 504 interactions
as well as a human PPI network from the meta—database PINA (Wu et al.,
2009) with 11354 proteins and 68 257 interactions. Expression data were
taken from a study on DLBCL from Alizadeh et al. (2000) and a subset
of a leukemia microarray collection for c—ALL/Pre—B—ALL with t(9;22)
and without t(9;22) translocation (ArrayExpress experiment: E—GEOD—
13159)(Haferlach et 01., 2010; Kohlmann et 01., 2008). The DLBCL data
comprise 194 samples on custom microarrays, containing probes for 3583
genes. Mapping these to the PINA network resulted in a largest connected
component of 2220 genes and 12 074 interactions. The ALL dataset contains
359 samples on Affymetrix hgu133plus2 gene chips with 54 675 probesets
corresponding to 19 738 genes with gene symbol and Entrez ID. Of these,
10 576 can be mapped to the human PINA network, resulting in a largest
connected component of 10 576 genes and 63 015 interactions.

2.2 Integrated network analysis

Integration of gene expression data and the search for optimal modules has
been performed as described in Dittrich et al. (2008) with an algorithm
termed he inz (heaviest induced subgraph). Brieﬂy, the distribution of raw
p—values from a standard t—test, conducted on the microarray data, can be
considered as a mixture of signal and noise, where the signal component
is modeled to be Beta(a, 1) distributed (Pounds and Morris, 2003), whereas
the distribution of the noise component is by deﬁnition given as the uniform
distribution. By ﬁtting a Beta—uniform mixture (BUM) model, maximum—
likelihood estimates for all model parameters can be obtained that are
subsequently used to score the network nodes. The node score is given by
the likelihood ratio of the signal to the noise component and can be adjusted
by a threshold 1 depending on a pre—selected false discovery rate (FDR).

2.3 Extensions of the heinz algorithm

Based on the node score deﬁned in Section 2.2, we have proposed heinz
(Dittrich et al., 2008), a method to identify functional modules by ﬁnding
maximum—scoring connected subnetworks. In contrast to prevalent heuristic
methods, he inz is an exact approach, i.e. it ﬁnds provably optimal
and suboptimal solutions. The method exploits the close connection of
maximum—scoring connected subnetworks and prize—collecting Steiner trees
(PCSTs). In fact, we use an ILP based approach for the Steiner tree problem
after an initial problem transformation.

Here we have extended the he inz method to allow for the incorporation
of (i) edge weights and (ii) computing modules of a predeﬁned size.

(i) In (Dittrich et al., 2008), we deﬁned modules as optimal solutions to
the following problem: given an undirected, vertex—weighted graph
G = (V, E, w) with weights w: V —> R, ﬁnd a connected subgraph T =
(VT, ET) of G, VT 6 V, ET 6 E that maximizes score(T) = ZVGVT w(v).
We have shown that an optimal module can always be represented
by a tree in case the edge scores are neglected. We now extend
our formulation to incorporate edge scores in the following way:
given an undirected, vertex— and edge—weighted graph G=(V,E,w)
with weights w : VUE—> R, ﬁnd a subtree T = (VT,ET) of G, VT 6 V,
ET 6 E that maximizes score(T) = ZVGVT w(v) + ZeeET w(v). We can
show a similar transformation to the PCST problem as in the original
algorithms that allows only node weights.

(ii) It is easy to change our method such that it ﬁnds the optimal—
scoring module of a ﬁxed, predeﬁned size k. In our ILP, binary
variables xv determine the presence of nodes in the optimal subgraph
T, that is, xv=1 if veVT and xv=0 otherwise. Just adding the
constraint Zvev xv = k limits the search space to contain only modules
of size k.

The heinz algorithm can be accessed from the open—source R
package BioNet (Beisser et al., 2010), available from http://bionet.bioapps.
biozentrum.uni—wuerzburg.de and the Bioconductor project. The package
includes the integration of data, scoring of nodes and alternative methods
for network search and visualization. The methods for the calculation of
consensus modules are integrated in the BioNet package.

2.4 GO enrichment

For functional characterization of genes contained in the identiﬁed modules
a gene ontology (GO) (Ashbumer et al., 2000) term enrichment against the
complete network was performed. This identiﬁes the GO categories that are
signiﬁcantly overrepresented in a set of genes. The analysis was conducted
using the R package GOstats (Falcon and Gentleman, 2007).

2.5 Simulation of reference modules

To evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithm and the improvement
over other methods, a simulation framework has been created on the basis
of the input microarray data. For this we use an induced PPI network from
HPRD contained in the BioNet package with 2034 genes which are existent
on the DLBCL microarray. To compare the resulting modules to the true
solution, a reference module S =(W,F), W g V and F gE, of size k as a
subgraph of graph G: (V,E) is created as follows:

(1) Start with a given graph G: (V,E) and an empty subgraph S
(2) Select random seed node v e V and include node in W

(3) Expand S by adding a node u and its induced edges from the
neighborhood 8(S) :2 {u e V | (w, u) 6E, w e W, u e V\W}, for which
its average shortest path length [5(a) within S is most similar to its
average shortest path length lg(u) within the full network.

(4) Repeat Step 3 until given size is reached, that is, |W| =k

The average shortest path length was chosen as a characteristic network
measure, which remains approximately constant to the average shortest path

length of the network for all extracted modules in real datasets. Modules
with longer average shortest paths correspond to sparse subnetworks that are
frequently not biologically relevant (Ulitsky etal., 2010).

The subnetwork is termed signal module in the following. Signal modules
of varying sizes k are generated. For the genes contained in this module
expression values are simulated showing differential expression between
two groups (see Supplementary Section S2). Subsequently, the simulated
gene expression data are analyzed as detailed in Section 2.2.

2.6 Resampling procedure

The statistical method of jackkniﬁng was ﬁrst introduced by Quenouille
(1956) and Tukey (1958) by deleting one observation to estimate the bias
and variance of a statistic of interest. The more general delete—j observations
jackknife draws random subsets of the data without replacement by deleting
j observations. The delete—half jackknife has similar properties as another
resampling method, the bootstrap (Felsenstein, 2004), and can be seen as an
approximation of it (Efron, 1979). The difference between these resampling
approaches is that the bootstrap is a random resampling procedure with
replacement, and the jackknife draws random subsets of the data without
replacement by deleting j observations.

Often one is interested in the standard error or the conﬁdence interval (CI)
of statistical estimator 1 for a parameter of interest that is given as function
T of the data points 161,162, ...,x,,

t=T(x1,x2,...,xn).

Drawing J times randomly a subset of n— j values from the observed data
161,162, ...,x,, we obtain J jackknife pseudo—replicates of n — j data points. For
each sample the estimates

1(1) =T(x(1i),xg), ...,x,(::j>, i=1,...,J,
are calculated. Based on this jackknifed distribution of the estimator the
standard error and CIs can be estimated. A 50% jackknife was used and half
of the observations dropped as recommended by Felsenstein (1985, 2004).

2.7 Perturbation of the network

The stability and variance of modules calculated on an integrated protein—
protein interaction network are studied by investigating simulated datasets
with respect to three types of perturbations of the network. The perturbations
considered are random deletion, addition and rewiring of 10, 25 and 50%
of all edges in the network. The method and analysis is described in more
detail in the Supplementary Section $32. In addition, we analyze whether
networks with different numbers of interactions, e. g. HPRD and PINA, alter
the results obtained from real biological networks.

2.8 Comparisons to other methods

To assess the performance of the algorithms, we generated artiﬁcial
expression data with signal modules as detailed in Section 2.5 for
varying module sizes. The DEGAS algorithm (Ulitsky et 611., 2008, 2010),
implemented in the program Matisse, identiﬁes minimal connected
subnetworks in a PPI network in which the number of dysregulated
genes from expression proﬁles exceeds a certain threshold. The tool
jActiveModules (Ideker etal., 2002) is another heuristic approach to identify
high—scoring subnetworks based on expression p—values by transforming
p—values into scores and assigning each protein of a PPI network a score.
The DEGAS algorithm is applied throughout the study with the following
parameters: UP regulated, dysregulation ratio = 1, number of outlier cases
2 1 (parameter 1), heuristic = ExpandingGreedy, k—steps = 1, parameter k
(number of signiﬁcant genes per case) is varied in steps of 10 from minimum
tested k=1 and maximum tested k=10 to minimum tested k=n—9 and
maximum tested k=n to obtain modules of varying sizes (for simulated
modules of size 25 and 50: 11:70, for module of size 150: n: 100). For
jActiveModules the number of modules is set to 1 and it is run iteratively on
the previous solution until the smallest possible module size is reached.

Fig. 1. Outline of the consensus algorithm. First, the microarray data are
resampled, i.e. for each gene the expression values are resampled using
jackknife. Differential expression is tested on all jackknife—replicates. A
BUM model is ﬁtted to the resulting p—value distribution. Based on the
estimated parameters of the distribution, scores are calculated for all nodes
of the network. For each scored network the maximum—scoring subnetwork
(MSS) is calculated. Each of the resulting modules differs slightly due to the
resampling, this set of modules is subsequently used as a basis for deriving
consensus node and edge scores. Then, the original network is rescored with
the consensus scores and the MSS is calculated. The resulting consensus
module collects as many highly supported nodes and edges as possible (see
Section 3.1) and thus constitutes the maximal robust and accurate module

The accurate identiﬁcation of simulated modules is evaluated in a
precision—recall (PR) curve, where the precision quantiﬁes the number
of correctly identiﬁed nodes among the ones identiﬁed as positives
[TP/(TP + FP)] and the recall measures the fraction of correctly identiﬁed
nodes among all correctly classiﬁed nodes [TP/(TP + FN)]. A compact
representation of the PR curve is given by the FmX score, which is the
maximum over F1 2 2 -precision -recall / precision + recall. The variability of
obtained solutions is assessed by calculating the pairwise J accard coefﬁcient
JV =AvﬂBv/AVUBV, where Av, Bv are the vertex sets of the modules
A and B. Furthermore, the accuracy and variance of the solutions on
perturbed data and on perturbed networks are assessed (for details see
Supplementary Section S3). The algorithm is run on a network with perturbed
gene expression data; or on a perturbed network with the original gene
expression data.

3 RESULTS

3.1 The consensus algorithm

Here, we propose a jackknife procedure to assess the robustness and
variability of the network modules as depicted in Figure 1. Brieﬂy,
the algorithm for the calculation of the consensus modules consists
of the following steps:

(1) Resampling of microarray data using jackknife for J pseudo—
replicates (Fig. 1, ﬁrst line);

 

1 889

112 /§.IO'S[BU.IHOIP.IOJXO'SOIlBIIIJOJUIOIQ/ﬁdnq 111011 pep1201umoq

(2) Scoring network nodes and calculating the MSS of the size
of the original module for each jackknife—replicate (Fig. 1,
middle part);

(3) Calculating the frequency of nodes and edges in the resulting
jackknifed modules;

(4) Rescoring the network with a consensus score derived from
the frequency of edges and nodes (Fig. 1, lower part);

(5) Calculating the MSS of equal size to the original module. This
constitutes the consensus module.

In more detail, the algorithm starts with the generation of J
jackknife samples of the expression data (J: 100 throughout the
study, for comparisons consensus modules with J = 1000 were
computed, yielding very similar modules in the biological examples
with a highly signiﬁcant correlation (r>0.98) for node and edge
support values). For each jackknife pseudo—replicate a node score is
calculated in the same manner as for the original data as detailed in
Section 2.2. Subsequent module searches results in a set of slightly
differing modules Gl- = (Vi,E,-), 1 5 i 5 J for each pseudo—replicate.
The frequency of each gene in the resulting J modules is used to
deﬁne a consensus score for each node and each edge

516): (ZvaVl-l) —p, She): (Enema-I) —p,
1:1 1:1

for a given threshold ,0 E [0, J] (,0 =J / 2 throughout the study). This
means in particular, that only nodes or edges occurring more than ,0
times in the set of resampled modules get a positive score. Support
values are calculated from the resampling procedure for the nodes
and edges of the network. On the one hand these can be used
for annotation of the obtained original module. Alternatively, the
support values can be used to derive a new score for the network
and calculate a novel module, the consensus module. The original
network is subsequently rescored with the consensus score for the
nodes and edges and the MSS is calculated with the size set to
the size of the original module. We deﬁne this resultant optimal
scoring subnetwork as the consensus module. This approach extends
the methodology described in Dittrich et 611. (2008) by additionally
optimizing over different module topologies, resulting in a highly
accurate and robust module with optimal support values.

The frequencies of the nodes and edges in the jackknifed modules
are used as support values in the consensus module. These scores
are visualized in the plot of the modules via the node sizes and
edge widths. The more often an edge or a node occurs in any of the
perturbed modules, the more likely it is, that it is a robust part of the
functional module and should be considered for further analysis.

3.2 Assessing the variance of resulting modules
in a simulation study

Since our objective is not only to ﬁnd a module which obtains a good
accuracy, but also yields results that are robust to minor changes
in the underlying data, we assessed the robustness and variance
of obtained solutions in a simulation study. The analysis was
performed on simulated perturbed data generated with jackkniﬁng as
described in Sections. 2.5 and 3.1. To compare our method to other
approaches, we used the exact algorithm on which the consensus
approach is based (Dittrich et 611., 2008), the DEGAS method of the
program Matisse (Module Analysis via Topology of Interactions and

Similarity SEts; Ulitsky and Shamir, 2007) and the module ﬁnding
plug—in jActiveModules (Ideker et 611., 2002) for Cytoscape. The
comparisons were performed on a 50 node signal module with a
signal strength of 1 (difference in means) between the two conditions
in the microarray data. A 50% jackknife was used to generate 20
datasets of perturbed microarray data as input for all three methods.
Further analyses with different simulated module sizes (25 and 150)
are included in the Supplementary material (Supplementary Figs. S2
and S3). The same PPI subnetwork derived from HPRD, consisting
of the genes from the microarray was used for all algorithms.
Different module sizes were obtained from the programs by either
changing size parameters or iteratively applying the method on the
resulting subnetwork. This allowed us to assess the performance
and variability in PR curves, F 1 —measure and Jaccard coefﬁcient.
The resulting PR—curves of the 20 resampled datasets for varying
module sizes are depicted in Figure 2A for jActiveModules, Matisse
and he inz, respectively. A ﬁtted lowess regression for all 20 PR—
curves is depicted, for detailed plots see Supplementary Figure S1.
Figure 2B shows the maxima of the F 1 —measure (F max) for the 20
resamples of each method. Apparently, the heinz modules obtain
the highest Fmax values as well as the smallest variance in Fmax.
The difference in means of the obtained F max for the three methods
is highly signiﬁcant (Wilcoxon test) as well as the difference in
variance between jActiveModules and heinz (p—value of 0.007
in the Brown—Forsythe version of the Levene—type test for equal
variance (Levene, 1960; Brown and Forsythe, 1974)). We chose
the 20 best solutions of each algorithm in terms of precision and
recall to see how they perform regarding the variance (Fig. S4A—C).
Figure 2C depicts a histogram of how often a node is found in
a module. Methods with many stable nodes (i.e. those that occur
in almost all modules) and few unstable nodes (those that occur
in almost no module) had robust solutions with a low variance,
whereas methods with opposite characteristics were non—robust and
gave very different solutions for each resampled dataset. Here the
most robust method was again he inz, with few nodes appearing
only in few modules and most nodes appearing in all modules.
Furthermore, the number of correctly assigned nodes was highest
for our algorithm. The pairwise Jaccard coefﬁcients of the 20 best
solutions (190 comparisons for each method, Fig. 2D and Fig. S4)
showed the variability in the resulting modules. Whereas generally
large Jaccard coefﬁcients illustrated a high similarity between all 20
modules. The differences in means between the Jaccard coefﬁcients
of heinz and Matisse and he inz and jActiveModules were highly
signiﬁcant (two sample Wilcoxon test, p—value of 5-10‘64 and
3 . 10—64).

The analyses with different simulated module sizes indicate that
accuracy and variability of the exact approach (heinz) is independent
of signal size (module size) in contrast to the heuristic methods. Here
in particular for small signal sizes the heuristic approaches show a
high variability and a high drop in accuracy (see Fig. S1—3).

In addition to the noise arising from the integrated gene expression
data, possibly false positive and false negative interactions of the
network must also be taken into account. Therefore we perturbed
the interaction networks as described in Section 2.7 and assessed
the accuracy and variance similarly to the previous analysis. The
effect of deleting, adding and rewiring random edges from the
network is shown in Fig. S5A—C, by plotting precision versus
recall of the obtained functional modules. Figure 3 shows the
effect of the random rewiring of edges on the performance of the

Fig. 2. Comparative analysis of module detection methods. On 20 simulated resamples of microarray data, with a module size of 50 nodes, the methods
Matisse, jActiveModules and he inz have been applied to detect functional modules (Supplementary Fig. S1A—C). The accuracy is analyzed by precision—
recall plots by varying the size of the resulting module over size parameter settings (Matisse, he inz) or iterative runs (jActiveModules). (A) PR curves for

results reveal the superior performance of the exact algorithm (he inz) in terms of accuracy (pr—curves, F max) and robustness (J accard coefﬁcient). Similar
results were obtained by smaller and larger simulated module sizes (Supplementary Figs. S1—3)

different algorithms. With varying degree of perturbation, from 10%
to 50%, the performance of the methods decreases. Again, he inz
shows most robust performance when changing the underlying
network, even with 50% of the edges rewired. The other methods
are more sensitive to destruction of the network and show a
decreasing performance upon rewiring of edges. We also looked
at the consistency of the solutions in Figure 3B by calculating the
Jaccard coefﬁcient of ﬁve independent solutions for each level of
perturbation and each method. The results show that heinz is very
robust in identifying the same solutions on perturbed networks.

3.3 Case studies on biological expression datasets

We applied the proposed algorithm to the ALL dataset (Haferlach
et al., 2010; Kohlmann et al., 2008). In particular we investigated
the differential expression between pre B—cells with and without
the t(9;22) translocation, also known as Philadelphia translocation.
Using an FDR of 0.01 we calculated the consensus module from
100 (and 1000) jackknife resamples of the microarray data (Fig. 4).
Support values were determined for the nodes and edges contained in
the module, i.e. edges with high—jackknife support values represent
interactions between genes/proteins that appeared often together in
resampled subnetworks. 27% of the genes from the original module
were obviously an unrobust signal and appeared too infrequently in
the jackknifed modules to be contained in the consensus. The high
variability in the data is also reﬂected by the low—j ackknife support
values of the consensus module. The consensus module, particularly
the robustly connected component with jackknife support of the
edges and nodes greater than 25% (Fig. 4B, highlighted in yellow)
contains essential genes for the analyzed cytogenetic translocation.
Among these are prominently the genes BCR and ABL1, which
form a fusion transcript due to the translocation and constitutively
activate downstream signaling. Thereby inhibiting apoptosis through
activation of a Ras—dependent signaling pathway (Cortez et al.,
1996), including the involvement of RRAS, SOSl, GRB2, RHOA
and TP53. Further essential associations to SCR were shown
(Deininger, 2004) as well as to insulin—signaling pathways, including
the proteins IGF1R, IRS1, PI3K and GRB2 (Traina et al., 2003).

GO term enrichment analysis was performed on the resulting
modules (Table S1—S4) and the robust component of the consensus
module. The enriched biological processes of the consensus
module include several intracellular signaling cascades, among
them the above mentioned connections to Ras protein and insulin
signaling pathways. The robust component alone hints to DNA
damage response and signal transduction resulting in induction of
apoptosis and cell communication. Functional modules obtained
with jActiveModules and Matisse are shown in the Supplementary
Material (Fig. S7). They lack important proteins deregulated in the
disease, e. g. the most prominent: BCR and ABL1.

Analogously we applied the proposed algorithm to the DLBCL
dataset (Rosenwald et al., 2002). In DLBCL we searched for
modules which are differentially expressed between the two tumor
subgroups, germinal center B—cell—like (GCB) DLB CL and activated
B—cell—like (ABC) DLBCL. With an FDR of 10—7 we calculated the
consensus module based on 100 (and 1000) jackknife resamples
(Fig. 5).

In contrast to the ALL dataset, nodes and interactions of the
resulting DLBCL consensus module were much more robust, as
indicated by the higher support values. Only 6% of the genes of
the original module were not included in the consensus module.
Therefore when using the edges and nodes with at least 50% support
values, a large part of the consensus module was selected as robustly
connected component (Fig. 5B, highlighted in yellow). In particular
the robust component comprises genes with associations to known
deregulated processes in DLBCL. The ABC subtype of DLBCL
requires a chronic active B—cell signaling for cell survival (Davis
et al., 2010), represented by the genes LCK, LYN, BLNK, BCL2
and BCL6. It was shown for the more aggressive ABC DLBCL
subtype, that ABC cell lines have a constitutive expression of STAT3
and activation of NFKB (Davis et al., 2001; Gupta et al., 2011).
Acetylation of STAT3 by histone deacetylases (HDACs) was shown
to be responsible for the activation (Gupta et al., 2011). The genes
STAT3, HDACl and HDAC3 are part of the consensus module.
Activation of NFKB induces the expression IRF4, which in turn
inhibits BCL6 gene expression, and regulates the expression of
further NFKB target genes, such as CCND2, (CFLAR), BCL2 (Davis
et al., 2001) and PIM1. GO analysis (Table S5—S8) resulted in very

similar rather unspeciﬁc biological processes for the optimal and the
consensus module, due to the high similarity of these two modules.
The stronger signal in the gene expression data and less noise also
result in more similar modules from jActiveModules and Matisse
which also include some of the above mentioned genes (Fig. S8).

3.4 Run time

We use an ILP based approach for the PCST problem after
an initial problem transformation to calculate MSSs. In general
we made the experience, that despite the NP—hardness of the
problem the algorithm runs very fast on biologically relevant
instance size, usually ranging between seconds to minutes for
one calculation. The proposed jackknife resampling algorithm
scales linearly in the number of replicates, which is reﬂected in
its runtime behavior (Table 1). The highly signiﬁcant correlation
between modules calculated on 100 and 1000 jackknife replicates
shows that the smaller number of replicates are sufﬁcient for an
accurate modularization of the microarray data. Furthermore, the
computation can easily be run in parallel on a cluster or multicore
workstation.

4 DISCUSSION

Here we have presented a novel method for the identiﬁcation
of highly robust and accurate modules. We suggest a consensus
approach, based on jackkniﬁng, to calculate a resulting functional
module, whose inner structure is characterized and highlighted by
support values on nodes and edges. In an extensive simulation
study we compare our approach to well—established heuristic
module identiﬁcation methods in terms of accuracy and robustness.
Particularly, we distinguish between different sources of noise that
affect the obtained solutions: (i) the variability of the integrated
data (e.g. gene expression data), (ii) the variability of the underlying
network (e. g. PPI network) and (iii) the intrinsic methodological
variability for heuristic module identiﬁcation methods. In general,
the exact algorithm clearly outperforms the other validated heuristics
not only in terms of accuracy but also in terms of robustness. In
particular, the simulation of perturbed networks reveals that the
performance of heuristic module detection methods declines faster
and more pronounced with increasing level of perturbations in
contrast to the exact approach. Interestingly, our simulation results
indicate that even the inclusion of a large number of false positive
edges has only a limited inﬂuence on the accuracy of functional
module identiﬁcation, whereas the deletion of edges has a much
stronger effect. This holds true for all algorithms examined in
this study. These simulation results have also implications for the
analysis of real PPI data: in the context of integrated network
analysis low—conﬁdence interaction networks [e. g. in the STRING
database (Szklarczyk et al., 2011)] could perform similarly good
or better than high—conﬁdence PPI networks based on a high—
quality threshold which may lack a large number of true positive
edges. Analyses on the PINA and HPRD network, comprising large
differences in the number of interactions, show that on biological
networks the results are almost identical.

On the algorithmic side we have extended an existing exact
approach (Dittrich et al., 2008) in two directions: (i) by the
incorporation of edge scores and (ii) by the calculation of optimal
modules of a given size. On the biological side we have applied both
algorithms, the original exact method as well as the new proposed
consensus method, to two well—known microarray datasets (ALL,
DLBCL). These datasets differ in their signal content, which is
directly reﬂected by the support values of the consensus module.
In the case of a high—signal content, the results for the original
module and the consensus module agree in most parts, whereas

for weak signals they differ greatly from each other. In the latter
case the consensus module is a clear improvement as it represents
the optimal, robust solution and depicts substructures of high
conﬁdence. The results of our study underlined the importance
to distinguish robust signals from noise by the use of resampling
methods as implemented in the proposed consensus approach, which
inherits the accuracy from the optimal algorithm whereas on the
other side improving its robustness.

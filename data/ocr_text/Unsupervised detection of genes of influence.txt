ABSTRACT

Motivation: Lung cancer is often discovered long after its onset,
making identifying genes important in its initiation and progression a
challenge. By the time the tumors are discovered, we only observe
the final sum of changes of the few genes that initiated cancer and
thousands of genes that they have influenced. Gene interactions and
heterogeneity of samples make it difficult to identify genes consistent
between different cohorts. Using gene and gene—product interaction
networks, we propose a principled approach to identify a small
subset of genes whose network neighbors exhibit consistently high
expression change (in cancerous tissue versus normal) regardless
of their own expression. We hypothesize that these genes can shed
light on the larger scale perturbations in the overall landscape of
expression levels.

Results: We benchmark our method on simulated data, and show
that we can recover a true gene list in noisy measurement data. We
then apply our method to four non-small cell lung cancer and two
pancreatic cancer cohorts, finding several genes that are consistent
within all cohorts of the same cancer type.

Conclusion: Our model is flexible, robust and identifies gene
sets that are more consistent across cohorts than several other
approaches. Additionally, our method can be applied on a per-patient
basis not requiring large cohorts of patients to find genes of influence.
Our approach is generally applicable to gene expression studies
where the goal is to identify a small set of influential genes that
may in turn explain the much larger set of genome-wide expression
changes.

1 INTRODUCTION

The reality of cancer diagnosis is harsh. Despite continued advances
in surgical, pharmacological and radiological treatments, mortality

remains high, with lung cancer as the leading cause of cancer—
related deaths in the United States (Jemal et al., 2008). One of the
primary challenges of lung cancer is the detection of small, early—
stage tumors. Most cancers are identiﬁed and the tumor is excised
for molecular analysis at a late stage. By then, we are only able
to observe the ﬁnal sum of changes to cell structure and function
reﬂected in differential expression of a few genes that initiated
cancer and thousands of genes affected through gene interactions.

Because of the cascading effect, it is difﬁcult to identify genes that
are directly responsible for tumorigenesis from gene expression data
alone. Recently, a large number of studies have investigated the use
of known gene—gene relationships, such as physical interaction of
their proteins, to characterize cancer genes (J onsson and Bates, 2006;
Milenkovic and Przulj, 2008; Taylor et al., 2009) and to identify
more robust signatures of diseases including cancer (Chuang et al.,
2007; Fortney et al., 2010; Hwang and Park, 2009). For instance,
it has been shown that genes whose expression has changed are
more likely to be surrounded by genes whose expression has also
changed (Efroni et al., 2007; Subramanian et al., 2005; Vogelstein
and Kinzler, 2006; Watters and Roberts, 2004; Yan and Sun, 2008).
Initial attempts have relied on pre—deﬁned pathways or gene sets,
limiting these analyses to well—studied genes or known pathway
memberships. A more natural approach is to study the change in
expression of a gene directly in the context of the interaction network
of gene products, for instance, by identifying active subnetworks that
are predictive of the disease (Chuang et al., 2007; Fortney et al.,
2010; Hwang and Park, 2009).

Development of accurate models for identifying important genes
in cancer still face a number of key challenges. First, many methods
depend on the knowledge of ‘seed genes’ known to be involved in a
particular disease [e.g. Lage et al. (2007); Navlakha and Kingsford
(2010); Vandin et al. (2011)]. Second, the procedure for estimating
parameters in these models sometimes combine ad hoc heuristics
with underdetermined systems of equations (Ergl'in et al., 2007),
which may not be robust to expression or network noise. Third,
most methods require availability of a sufﬁciently large number of
samples in order to reach conclusions about important genes.

In this article, we start to address these challenges within a
framework for detecting genes of inﬂuence given a set of gene
expression proﬁles from tumor and healthy samples, and a network
of gene—gene interactions. Our method does not require seed genes;
does not have to simultaneously infer the network, circumventing
the second challenge outlined above; and can be applied on the

Unsupervised detection of genes of influence in lung cancer using biological networks

 

individual patient basis achieving great resolution and ﬂexibility.
We take a more direct approach for identifying potentially important
genes by asking: which genes can explain away the majority of
the observed gene expression changes of their neighbors? We use
an interaction network that includes both regulatory and physical
protein—protein interactions. Using simulated expression proﬁles,
we show that our model can recover genes of inﬂuence with high
precision and recall under varying levels of noise. We then apply
our procedure to four different cohorts of lung cancer patients, and
identify candidate genes of inﬂuence for each patient in each dataset
independently. We ﬁnd that genes of inﬂuence found by our method
are more consistent across patients and datasets compared with other
approaches, indicating that despite increasing the resolution of our
analysis to a per—patient level, our results are not overﬁtting.

2 METHODS

The ultimate goal of our work is to ﬁnd a small set of genes that can explain
some of the high changes in expression levels observed across a larger set
of genes. To tackle this task, we use the information encoded in known gene
and gene product interactions, usually represented as a network, which has
an edge if there is a direct interaction between gene products A and B, and
does not have an edge if there is no known interaction. If all neighbors of
A have a high expression change, we hypothesize that node A might have
inﬂuenced its neighbors to signiﬁcantly change in cancer compared with
normal tissue. We conclude then, that the contribution inﬂuence factor of
node A should be high if the change in expression levels between cancerous
and healthy tissue of its surrounding neighbors are high. Note, that we
derived the inﬂuence factor of node A without referring to its observed
value. This setup allows us to capture changes in target expression due to
post—translational modiﬁcations, where the change of expression levels of
the target genes is the only indication of the activity of the gene itself (its
own mRNA level does not change). Transcription factors (TFs) are typically
expressed at lower levels compared with non—TF genes (Vaquerizas et al.,
2009). The idea of summarizing the information about the gene using its
network neighborhood has already appeared in Pradines et al. (2004), where
the authors found that using network neighborhood to summarize a gene’s
impact is a way to smooth over different types of gene regulation. Similar
ideas have been used to infer the activity levels of transcription factors from
their known target genes (Gao et al., 2004). In what follows, we propose an
objective function that allows us to formalize the search for the inﬂuence
factors for all genes simultaneously.

2.1 Notation

For the purpose of describing our model, we use the terms gene and
protein interchangeably. Let a binary square matrix W e{0,1}dXd represent
an interaction network, where Wl‘j = 1 if genes i and j are connected in the
network, and Wl‘j =0 if they are not. d is the total number of genes in
the network. W represents direct (ﬁrst order) connectivity in the network,
connecting genes that have direct interactions. W2=W x W, the second
power of W, is the set of second—order interactions and, generally, the n—th
power of W: W”, is the n—th order, i.e. each row (or column, the matrix is
symmetric) of W” contains information about the number of paths of length it
between all pairs of genes in the network. In this work, we are only interested
in the existence of a path, rather than the number of them, thus we binarize
the W” matrix. Since we are not interested in how many paths start and
ﬁnish in the same gene, we set the diagonal of the matrix to zero. Finally,
we assume that for two genes i and j, the more direct path is more likely to
be of inﬂuence among all paths of different orders. For example, if i and j
have a direct and a second—order connection, we assume that the inﬂuence
would propagate across the direct connection, and we would need to set the
second—order connection to 0. In formal terms, this condition can be stated

as follows: [W”],-j=0 if Elk: [Wk],-j >0,k = 1...n— 1. The modiﬁed version
of W” employed here is W”*:

1 if [Wm->0, iyéj
W”* = and Vk=1...n—1:[Wk],-j =0.
0 otherwise

Let Ze Sid X1 represent the log of the ratio in expression of our d genes
between tumor and normal tissue. The change of expression is measured
between the current expression level of a gene (for e.g. in a lung cancer
patient) and the ‘nonnal’ expression level (as measured in healthy patients).
We describe the exact measurement procedure and the distribution of Z in
Section 3.

2.2 Formulation

Our objective function formalizes our assumption that each gene’s expression
change can potentially be explained by the inﬂuence of its neighbors. In
the simplest case, the i—th gene’s expression change, given by z), can be
explained by the added effects of its direct neighbors: z,- wZJ-ale-j where
aj is an unknown factor of inﬂuence of gene j on its neighbors that we have
to estimate. To extend this formulation to indirect neighbors, we note that
inﬂuence of n—th order neighborhood is Zjajn[W”*],-j where Oljn can, for
example, be constrained to decrease with increasing n. Thus, the additive
effect of all neighbors up to order n on gene i is Zn Zjajn[W”*],-j. We
can then formulate our hypothesis of inﬂuence in the most general way as
ziwzn ZjOljn[Wn*]ij. Our goal is to ﬁnd the unknown inﬂuence factors
Bi that allow us to explain the expression change of all d genes. We can
achieve this goal by ﬁnding Bi that minimizes the following squared error:
argminazzii[Zil21znajn[W"*]U—Zi]2~

Because we want to ﬁnd a small number of genes that explain the
changes network—wide and because the majority of the genes might not have
signiﬁcant detectable inﬂuence on their neighbors, we must regularize our
likelihood to produce a sparse solution. We propose to use a combination of
£1 = ||5t||1 and £2 = ||5t||2 regularization factors known as elastic net penalty
(Friedman et al., 2010; Zou and Hastie, 2005): P§(a)= %(1—s)||&||§+
Elldlll, where E is the trade—off parameter between sparsity (El—norm)
and shrinkage (ﬁg—norm), 5:1 corresponding to the Lasso penalty. The
motivation for the elastic net penalty comes from the fact that when there
are two sufﬁciently correlated covariates that are predictive of the outcome,
the [51 penalty makes an arbitrary selection between the two, whereas the
elastic net penalty selects both of them but shrinks the importance of each
of them based on the E parameter. In our case, the elastic net penalty allows
to recover all genes that can explain observed expression change rather than
just one of them.

Our full objective function can then be generally written as the sum of the
error term and a parameter regularization term corresponding to sparseness
as described above:

d d
arggninZEZaJ-niwnnij—Zi]2+AP,(oZ.), (1)

where 5a,, 2 {a1n,a2n,...,adn} are the inﬂuence factors up to order n to be
estimated and A is the regularization parameter.

The order of adjacency, n, in practice is considered to be no greater than
2: ne{1,2}, restricting the inﬂuence only to the ﬁrst— and second—order
neighbors in the network. The reason for that is 2—fold; on one hand, for
most nodes third—degree neighborhood spans the extent of almost the entire
network, making neighborhoods of order beyond 3 not very informative of
individual genes, and on the other, currently there is very little information
about the extent of physical inﬂuence of a gene on the expression level of
its neighbor that is 3 hops away.

While EGO model requires 2d parameters, twice as many as FD, it is able
to consider second—order inﬂuence of genes on each other.

2.3 Optimization and model selection

To solve for the parameters of EGO and FD, we use a coordinate descent
procedure (Friedman et al., 2010), which solves for the entire regularization
path available as part of the glmnet package. To do so, we write Equations
(2) and (3) as the solution to a linear regression problem with the elastic net
penalty. Let W: [W W2*] and )7 = [aT BT]T. Then we can obtain )7 (which
is composed of Bi and B) by solving:

afgfnin(W)7—Z)T(W77—Z)+AP.§()7). (4)
V

In order to ﬁnd suitable settings for the regularization parameter A, we use
the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). In particular, we compute the BIC
score for various settings of A: BIC(A)=dlog((f)2)+N)log(d) where N) is
the number of non—zero elements in )7 for a particular setting of A and a) is
the error variance. We then choose a setting of A that results in the lowest
BIC score. The use of BIC score is common in the elastic—net regularized
regression setting [e.g. Zou and Zhang (2009)]. We choose 5 in the range of
Se [0.1 1] that gives us the maximum number of non—zero entries in y.

2.4 Normalization

The above model ignores the fact that hub genes (i.e. genes that have a
large degree in the interaction network) have many more interactions than
non—hub genes. Therefore, without normalizing the matrices W and W2*, the
coefﬁcients assigned to the high—degree nodes will likely be much smaller
than those assigned to low—degree nodes. To correct for this, we normalize
the matrices W and W2* using symmetric normalization. Let D be a diagonal
matrix with diagonal entries equal to the node degrees: D),- =Zj W,~, then

the symmetrically normalized matrix is given by D‘l/2 WD‘l/Z.

2.5 Network data

Our EGO and FD models aim at identifying genes that have signiﬁcantly
changed neighborhoods between the tumor and normal populations. To
obtain the highest coverage of the genes in our study, we have constructed our
network from a combination of three sources of interactions: physical protein
interaction data [downloaded from the HPRD database (Mishra, 2006)],
interactions that are derived from pathway membership [downloaded from
Pathway Commons (Cerami, 2010)] and regulatory interactions as described
in Ravasi (2010). The ﬁnal network consists of 7708 genes and 49 433
interactions and contains genes that have at least one neighbor and are not
part of stand—alone pairs.

3 RESULTS

To illustrate our methodology, we ﬁrst study a simulated scenario: we
impute inﬂuential genes in a real interaction network (as described

in Section 2.5) and then recover them with our two proposed models.
We then apply our method to four lung cancer datasets, using the
same interaction network. Since in the real data scenario we do not
have the information about which genes have most profound effect
on their neighbors, we evaluate our performance in an unbiased
way by examining consistency of the found genes among the four
independent lung cancer datasets.

3.1 Simulating important genes

We determine how accurately we can recover true inﬂuential genes
in a real network under the assumption of correctness of our
methods. We simulate the expression changes as follows:

(1) Randomly sample K 6 {10,20, 30,40,50} genes and set them
to be the known genes of interest.

(2) For each of the K genes, sample (Zuniformly at random on
the interval [0.2, l]d (the same for ,8 in the EGO model).

(3) Use the EGO or FD model to propagate the changed
expression values to their ﬁrst— and second—order neighbors,
where appropriate.

(4) Add the noise 77 to all the genes in the network.

The log of expression change (z) is known to be distributed
approximately as N (0,0) (Chen et al., 1997). To construct
the expression—change noise model, we estimate a from the
housekeeping genes for which the expression level in the given data
is not supposed to change. In our data, the basic noise model of the
log of expression change is estimated to be 77 ~N(0, 0.0842).

Note that Step (2) above corresponds to selecting the ‘true
inﬂuential genes’, which is then followed by propagating inﬂuence
to the rest of the network. The range of simulated inﬂuence
values &:Vi,ai E [0.2, l] is a scaled version of the realistic alpha
values, selected for the ease of interpretation. Having simulated
the expression change in all genes, our goal is to determine which
genes were the initiators of the observed expression change. We
use the area under precision recall curve (AUPR) to evaluate
how well EGO and FD recover the true inﬂuential genes in each
simulation scenario. Figure 1 shows the performance of EGO on
EGO—simulated expression on ﬁve different gene set sizes (K E
{10,20,30,40,50}). As shown, EGO can recover true inﬂuential
gene sets with high precision. EGO performs better on smaller gene
sets. Such bias can be explained by the fact that the more genes are
affecting their neighbors, the more confounding the effect will be
with some of the weaker signal getting harder to recover.

We also investigated how well each of our models can identify
the true inﬂuential set if the data were generated based on the
assumptions of the other. Figure 2 shows the performance of EGO
and FD, where the simulated expression is generated under the
opposing model. As expected, EGO can accurately recover the true
inﬂuential genes when the expression is simulated through the FD
model, ﬁnding second—order interactions to be irrelevant. However,
FD fails to recover the second—order effect and thus results in much
lower accuracy, when the expression levels were propagated to ﬁrst—
and second—order neighbors according to the EGO model.

In summary, our simulation results show that FD and EGO,
can accurately identify the set of true inﬂuential genes when
the simulated expression coincides with the appropriate model

assumptions. In addition, the EGO model can also recover the true
gene set when the simulated expression conforms to the FD model.

3.2 Robustness to noise in the network

Since to identify genes of interest our model relies on the network
connectivity, here we inspect the stability of our performance with
respect to the noise in the network. To do so, we have examined
scenarios with 0, l, 10, 25 and 50% of missing edges and added
edges (independently). Each network perturbation was performed
by removing (or adding) edges uniformly at random. We have found
that our list is robust to small perturbations in the network, at
least up to 1% of either addition or deletion of edges. At 10% of
noise, the median performance drops from 0.9 to 0.75 AUPR for
removed edges and to 0.5 for randomly added edges. This conﬁrms
our hypothesis that the methodology is much more sensitive to the
addition of false edges rather than to missing true ones (at random).
The results for the full range of noise levels are shown on Figure 3.

3.3 Experiments on lung cancer dataset

Motivated by our results on the simulated data, here we investigate
gene importance in lung cancer using gene expression across
four independent cohorts of patients available as part of the
Director’s Challenge Study [Director’s Challenge Consortium for
the Molecular Classiﬁcation of Lung Adenocarcinoma et al. (2008)].
Our goal is to show that our EGO model identiﬁes genes across

these four datasets more consistently than alternative approaches.
The four cohorts that we have examined contained 82, 79, 178 and
104 patients and 49 controls as described in Director’s Challenge
Study. To account for batch effects, we normalized each cohort
using RMA (Rafael, 2003). We used SAM (Tusher et al., 2001)
to obtain normalized differential expression. For a given dataset, we
ran EGO to ﬁnd inﬂuential genes for each patient independently.
We then evaluated consistency at two levels: (i) across patients
within the same dataset and (ii) across different cohorts. In the
following section, we examine the consistency of our predictions
across the four datasets, and compare EGO results to (i) FD,
(ii) a subnetwork discovery method Chuang et al. (2007) and
(iii) independent t—testing. It took 1h to run EGO on all the 443
patients in parallel on a cluster of 400 nodes with <5 GB of RAM
per run.

consistency of our method, we have applied our approach to each
patient in the four cohorts independently. Figure 4 shows the
coefﬁcients at or ,8, as found by EGO (genes inﬂuential in both ﬁrst—
and second—order neighborhoods would appear twice). The genes
are ordered by consistency across patients: genes found inﬂuential
in more patients are at the top, and by increase in explanation power

number of inﬂuential genes are further to the right.

There are 3,16,16 and 7 genes that appeared in >50% of the
patients in Director 1,2, 3 and 4 datasets, respectively. The overlap
between those four sets of genes is shown in Table 1. Three genes
present in >50% of the population across all four cohorts are the
top three genes in Figure 4: ADM, FCN2 and ACO2. ADM was
found to explain its ﬁrst—order neighbors (non—zero 0t coefﬁcient)
and FCN2 and ACO2 were found to signiﬁcantly impact their
second—order neighbors (non—zero ,8). Functionally, ADM has been
previously associated with tumor growth (Miller et al., 1996), while
FCN2 is part of a module associated with immune response. In
our network, FCN2 and its neighborhood are functionally enriched
in the activation of immune response (a: 1.37e—l3) and immune
effector process (a: 1.06e—l6, where q—value is FDR corrected
P—value). FCN2 itself is a known part of the innate immune system

(Garred et al., 2009). ADM and FCN2 and their neighborhoods
are shown on Figure 5. While these genes are currently not
associated with lung cancer directly, each have been implicated in
relevant processes: ADM’s inhibition, for example, decreases lung
angiogenesis (Vadivel et al., 2010); while lower levels of FCN2
have been associated with recurrent respiratory infections in children
(Cedzynski et al., 2009); ACO2 is involved in the Kreb’s cycle,
which is part of the respiratory system.

We provide the network and dataset characteristics of these three
genes in Table 2. We also list the statistics for TP53 and EFGR
genes widely known to be associated with cancer. From Table 2, it
is evident that the known genes can be recovered by simply studying
the degree distribution. Our method instead focuses on genes that
could not be revealed by the simple network characteristics, nor by
the differential expression levels, but by considering network and
differential expression together in principled fashion.

3.3.2 Comparison with other methods We have tested the
consistency performance of our EGO method against FD, the
subnetwork method by Chuang et al. (2007) and t—tests. We found
that there was no overlap between the genes found by FD. Brieﬂy,
Chuang et al. (2007) ﬁnds subnetworks of genes that result in best
performance on a classiﬁcation task (e.g. adenocarcinoma versus
normal). It requires a gene network and expression proﬁles for
a set of patients. In the original work, the approach was used to
predict metastasis in breast cancer, i.e. the found subnetworks were
optimized to predict a binary class indicating whether the breast
cancer in the given patient has metastasized or not. We have used
the code available as Cytoscape plugin named PinnacleZ as was
suggested by the authors using 100 random trials, ST1 and ST2

Fig. 6. Each of the 7708 genes inﬂuence on its ﬁrst (x—axis) versus second
order (y—axis) neighbors across all four Director cohorts.

P—value cutoffs of 0.05 and 20 000 ST3 trials. Additionally, max
node degree was set to 200, min improvement to 0.05, max module
size to 20 and max radius to 2. We have experimented with other
parameters as well, but not all of them returned a result set. We
found that the parameter settings above gave us the most consistent
outcome for the four datasets in this study. PinnacleZ resulted in an
overlap of three genes between Directors 2 and 3 (Table 1).

Independent t—tests for each of the genes in the four cohorts did
not result in consistency across cohorts either. Out of 7708 genes in
our network, over 6600 were signiﬁcantly different between tumor
and normal patients in each of the cohorts. We have taken the top
(3, l6, l6 and 7) genes according to EGO gene list sizes and ordered
genes by decreasing t—statistic in the case of a tie in P—value. There
was no overlap between t—test gene lists across the four lung cancer
cohorts on a full set of 11 911 genes. Once we restricted the list
to the 7708 from our network, there was an overlap of one gene
between datasets D1 and D4 as shown in Table 1.

In contrast, EGO ﬁnds three genes that overlap among all four
cohorts: ADM, FCN2 and ACO2. We note that it may be beneﬁcial
to look at both approaches: one that reveals consistency in change
in gene neighborhoods and one that reveals consistency across
differentially expressed genes since the two approaches compliment
each other. Full lists of genes for all methods for each of the Directors
datasets are available in the Supplementary Materials.

3.3.3 First- versus second-order inﬂuence factors In addition to
more consistency in our results, we can glean further information
about genes by inspecting our inﬂuence factors at and ,8. Figure 6
shows the scatter plot of inﬂuence on the ﬁrst— versus second—order
neighbors for all genes across all patients. The majority of the mass
on that plot is at (0,0). Those genes that have non—zero inﬂuence
exhibit either ﬁrst— or second—order inﬂuence but not both. This is
interesting because there are no constraints that would not allow
selection of the same gene twice. Since in our networks there are
no second—order paths that have a corresponding ﬁrst—order path
between two genes (see deﬁnition of W”* in Section 2.1), we are
able to reveal genes that exhibit independent second—order inﬂuence
and are not simply part of tightly knit clusters.

We have then examined each individual patient for genes that
had both non—zero ﬁrst— and second—order effects. We found that
out of 443 patients, 74 had one gene with effect on both ﬁrst— and
second—order neighbors, and in four patients there were two genes
that had effect on both. Further analysis showed that there were
only three genes implicated in this joint inﬂuence for all patients

considered. These were SlOOAl2 (0,6,32,19), LGALSl (2,0,8,4),
PDIA6 (2,2,4,2), where the numbers in parenthesis indicate the
number of patients in which these genes had non—zero 0t and ,8
coefﬁcients simultaneously. While LGALSl and PDIA6 do not
have a strong signal, the pro—inﬂammatory protein S100A12 is
present in almost 20% of patients in Director cohorts 3 and 4. In
addition, SlOOAl2 is a known marker for chronic and acute lung
diseases (Lorenz et al., 2008). This fonding is in line with the
other lung inﬂammation factors that we found to be consistently
inﬂuential.

Our results lead us to believe that different genes exhibit
different patterns of inﬂuence. It is thus very important to go
beyond immediate neighborhoods to understand each gene’s role
and associations. We also note that most of the genes we found
to be consistent among patients are those with second—rather than
ﬁrst—order inﬂuences. Indeed, from the 21 genes on Figure 4,
only 4 (ADM, MYBPCl, PLKl and PSMDl) are ﬁrst—order
genes, the remaining 17 genes were inﬂuential in second—order
neighborhoods.

Finally, we have performed additional experiments on two
completely independent cohorts of pancreatic cancer patients. We
have again found much higher consistency by EGO as opposed to
the alternatives considered. In particular, of the total of 107 genes
found by EGO to be consistent among patients within each dataset
alone, 26 genes overlap between the two datasets (P = 0). PinnacleZ
ﬁnds a total of 373 genes of which 17 genes overlap between the
two datasets (P :05 X 10‘5) (Supplementary Materials).

4 DISCUSSION

Interestingly, many of the genes identiﬁed as inﬂuential and
consistent between cohorts were genes with signiﬁcant second—order
inﬂuence, alluding to the importance of post—translational modiﬁers.
We believe that allowing for independent recovery of such genes (de—
coupling of at and ,8 parameters in our model) is one of the reasons
for our superior performance. One can think of our method as a
projection of many genes onto a lower dimensional set of inﬂuential
genes. Our results reveal that these projections tend to be more
stable. Additionally, all the genes that we have recovered while not
being directly implicated in lung cancer, are associated with acute
or chronic respiratory inﬂammation.

One of the limitations of this work is modeling the change
in expression among neighbors as strictly additive. We do not
directly model the case where one neighbor is acting to increase
and another to decrease the expression level of a gene, unless they
do so consistently in their own neighborhoods resulting in jointly
positive (negative) impact. Though capturing those relations would
be ideal, it would require more data than are typically available and
an increased number of parameters. Otherwise, the model may be
unidentiﬁable [e. g. Ergiin et al. (2007)].

In summary, we propose an unsupervised approach to combing
through thousands of genes to identify a few of importance. We
deﬁne genes of importance as having inﬂuence on expression change
of their neighbors. Applied to a set of real cancer datasets, our
method ﬁnds a set of genes consistent across four cohorts of
adenocarcinoma lung patients considered. The inﬂuential gene set
is three orders of magnitude smaller than the total number of genes.
All the found genes have already been associated with respiratory
inﬂammation processes and might warrant further investigation.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Glycosylation is one of the most important post-
translational modifications of proteins, known to be involved in
pathogen recognition, innate immune response and protection
of epithelial membranes. However, when compared to the tools
and databases available for the processing of high-throughput
proteomic data, the glycomic domain is severely lacking. While
tools to assist the analysis of mass spectrometry (MS) and HPLC
are continuously improving, there are few resources available to
support liquid chromatography (LC)—MS/MS techniques for glycan
structure profiling. Here, we present a platform for presenting
oligosaccharide structures and fragment data characterized by
LC—MS/MS strategies. The database is annotated with high-quality
datasets and is designed to extend and reinforce those standards
and ontologies developed by existing glycomics databases.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glycosylation is a major post-translational modiﬁcation of proteins
that involves the addition of sugar chains to proteins and lipids, a
highly complex non—template driven process that generates a diverse
glycome. For glycoproteins, the extent of microheterogeneity
and macroheterogeneity makes the identiﬁcation of glycosylation
sites and glycan structure determination a challenging analytical
problem. Diverse structural modiﬁcations can range from a few
monosaccharide residues to heavily branched oligosaccharides
including modiﬁcation by non-carbohydrate substituents as well as
different linkages and anomeric conﬁgurations. Over the past few
years, analytical techniques that allow the effective characterization
of glycan structures have advanced. In contrast to genomics
and proteomics, glycan structures are not template derived and
glycomics thus requires well-constructed sets of databases to capture
glycan structure and related data that are frequently reported in
literature. It is accepted that glycoinformatics is in its infancy
but there has been a concerted effort to design glycoinformatic
resources to support analytical technologies in the form of a variety
of databases, tools and web services (reviewed by Frank and

Schloissnig, 2010; Lutteke, 2008). These high-quality databases
are capable of providing detailed information about the individual
glycans such as structure, biological origin and potential function
that are complemented by supporting analytical data. However, to
ensure that these resources continue to be relevant it is Vital that
strides in development and maintenance continue to support the
challenges of analytical and structural glycobiology.

2 A GLYCOMICS LC—MS DATABASE

Mass spectrometry (MS) and high-performance liquid
chromatography (LC) are established analytical techniques
used to address the challenges of glycomics, as they offer high
levels of sensitivity and can handle complex mixtures of glycan
variations. The coupling of LC with MS systems greatly improves
the separation power of MS and strategies have been reported
(Ruhaak et al., 2009; Schulz et al., 2002) for both 0- and N —linked
carbohydrates. Although glycoinformatic resources have been
implemented to assist the interpretation and annotation of data
generated by HPLC (Artemenko et al., 2010; Campbell et al.,
2008) and MS (Ceroni et al., 2008; Goldberg et al., 2009), there
is a distinct lack of informatics infrastructure that supports the
growing trend for the LC—MS strategies that are Vital to large-scale
glycomic and glycoproteomic studies. Here, we present the ﬁrst
release of an LC—MS/MS experimental fragmentation database
that will serve as a framework for other glycodatabases. In order
to evaluate the format, we have included 0-linked oligosaccharide
MS/MS data from recent publications (Estrella et al., 2010; Issa
et al., 2010; Karlsson and Thomsson, 2009).

3 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

The LC—MS/MS database uses the open-source object-relational
PostgreSQL database system and was built using the Java
environment and the Hibernate object/relational-mapping tool.

3.1 Database features

The design goal was to develop a comprehensive database
infrastructure capable of dealing with large volumes of primary
information and analytical data. The model provides a platform
focused on mass spectrometric data and structural assignments
based on fragmentation data that allows users to View all
metadata and key experimental data generated from the analysis
of glycans. The data model is fully integrated with EUROCarbDB

(von der Lieth et al., 2011) and several new database modules
have been developed; whereby the existing deﬁnitions have been
extended to allow connections between HPLC and MS schemas
to support the association of retention time with corresponding
MS spectra. These reﬁnements ensure that previously independent
HPLC and MS modules are compatible with future developments
including a central core for curating sample source information and
an overview of all characterized structures.

The information pages for the portal comprise three sections. The
ﬁrst section summarizes the project objectives and a description
of the published data stored. For each publication, a listing of all
glycan structures can be navigated to retrieve detailed structure and
experiment pages. Here, information pertaining to the experiment
can be accessed consisting of key attributes to describe the MS
instrumentation and settings, HPLC conditions including column
type, solvents, gradients and ﬂow rates. The modiﬁcation and
extension of the schemas to connect the two experimental techniques
of LC and MS allow for the novel display of retention time and
corresponding precursor ion mass that is linked with the MS spectral
evidence. The MS spectra section describes any modiﬁcations
(persubstituted molecules, reducing-end modiﬁcations) and ion
types in addition to the mode of data acquisition and the MS
devices used. In addition, the precursor ion mass for the elucidated
structure is supported with an annotated MS/MS fragment peak
list. We have focused on providing processed data since the
availability of organized and annotated analytical data will facilitate
the interpretation of glycomics and glycoproteomics data, and the
development of new strategies for the automated, high-throughput
identiﬁcation of glycan structures.

For each entry, a description of the biological source and
glycoprotein from which the glycans were isolated is displayed; in
addition, a presentation of the glycan type, core type, linkages and
anomeric conﬁgurations, composition and the supporting MS data
can be retrieved. Information content (exact structure, composition
or topology) for each structure is obtained from the literature. For
example, for a fully annotated structure the linkage information
and anomeric conﬁgurations must be stated and supported by
experimental evidence. If this information is absent or detailed
structural proﬁling was not undertaken, then only the topology of
the structure, based on a knowledge of the conserved biosynthetic
pathways, is given. Further information detailing the species, tissue
and disease state and links to PubMed and UniProt entries are also
available.

4 FUTURE PLANS AND CONCLUSIONS

The database outlined here is a novel approach for storing and
making available LC—MS glycomics data. Results are clearly
reported and all data submitted follows those guidelines proposed
and supported by EUROCarbDB. Its availability will serve as a
base for the development of new analytical tools for structural
data querying and MS spectra interpretation and establishes a link

between existing HPLC and MS resources that has been lacking
in glycoanalysis. Recording of LC retention time will allow an
extra level of conﬁdence in assignment of structures in reproducible
LC—MS conditions. By providing a common interface to high—
quality data, we believe that this tool can become a Vital resource
for analyzing glycomic data. At this stage, the pilot study has
shown that the database model provides an architecture that adopts
standards and practices developed by international consortia, in
order to share glycomic experimental data. In addition, several work
groups are improving work ﬂows to integrate data processing tools
with database storage and querying resources. It is envisaged that
methods will be available in the future to allow the capture of
raw and processed data that will allow the community to upload
published datasets. This capability is Vital to the future development
of glycomics analysis and it is anticipated that this resource will
form the basis for the continued development of glycoinformatic
resources.

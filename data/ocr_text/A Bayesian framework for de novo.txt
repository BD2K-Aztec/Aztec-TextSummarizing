Abstract

Motivation: Spontaneous (de novo) mutations play an important role in the disease etiology of
a range of complex diseases. Identifying de novo mutations (DNMs) in sporadic cases provides
an effective strategy to find genes or genomic regions implicated in the genetics of disease.
High—throughput next—generation sequencing enables genome— or exome—wide detection of DNMs
by sequencing parents—proband trios. It is challenging to sift true mutations through massive
amount of noise due to sequencing error and alignment artifacts. One of the critical limitations of
existing methods is that for all genomic regions the same pre—specified mutation rate is assumed,
which has a significant impact on the DNM calling accuracy.

Results: In this study, we developed and implemented a novel Bayesian framework for DNM
calling in trios (TrioDeNovo), which overcomes these limitations by disentangling prior mutation
rates from evaluation of the likelihood of the data so that flexible priors can be adjusted post—hoc
at different genomic sites. Through extensively simulations and application to real data we
showed that this new method has improved sensitivity and specificity over existing methods,
and provides a flexible framework to further improve the efficiency by incorporating proper priors.
The accuracy is further improved using effective filtering based on sequence alignment
characteristics.

1 Introduction

Traditional research in the field of genetics for human complex dis—
ease has focused largely on inherited variation. For sporadic cases
Without family history, it is well known that de novo copy number
variants are implicated in autism (Levy et 61]., 2011; Sebat et 61].,
2007) and other psychiatric disease (Hehir—Kwa et 61]., 2011; Maiti

et 61]., 2011). Cost—effective next—generation sequencing (NGS) tech—
nologies enable the identification of mutations at base—pair reso—
lution, and a ﬂurry of recent studies revealed important roles of de
novo point mutations in the genetic etiology of complex disease,
including autism spectrum disorders (Iossifov et 61]., 2012; Neale
et 61]., 2012; O’Roak et 61]., 2011, 2012; Ronemus et 61]., 2014;

Sanders et al., 2012), intellectual disability (Gregor et al., 2013;
Vissers et al., 2010), schizophrenia (Fromer et al., 2014; Gauthier
et al., 2010; Gulsuner et al., 2013). These findings showed prom-
ise of sequencing sporadic parents—proband trios for genetics
studies of human disease. Since de novo mutations (DNMs) have
not been subject to strong purifying selection, causal mutations
are expected to have large effects, enabling effective identification
of causal genes or pathways from a drastically reduced number of
candidates. We envision that this strategy will continuously be
used as an effective alternative to classical genetic studies to iden—
tify genetic factors through both exome and whole genome
sequencing.

A critical step in such studies is to accurately call DNMs from
sequencing. This is challenging due to sequencing error and align-
ment artifacts, which predominately outnumber true mutations. It is
therefore important to develop methods that can effectively sift real
mutations through massive amount of noise. Standard approaches
infer genotypes for each individual separately in a trio, usually using
GATK (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al., 2010) or Samtools
(Li et al., 2009), and identify putative DNMs by comparing pro—
band’s and parental genotypes. More efficient joint calling methods
have been developed, including PolyMutt (Li et al., 2012) 86
DeNovoGear (Ramu et al., 2013), and were shown to outperform
standard approaches dramatically. A major limitation of these j oint-
calling methods is the entanglement of DNMs with Mendelian in-
heritance in the same model such that the joint likelihood of the
data depends on the pre—specified mutation rate, resulting in several
unappealing consequences. First, it requires specifying a prior muta—
tion rate, which has strong influence on the mutation calling (Ramu
et al., 2013), and therefore can result in loss of accuracy when in-
appropriate mutation rates are used. Second, it is well known that
mutation rates vary widely across the genome, and therefore any sin-
gle pre—specified mutation rate is not optimal. Third, the estimates
for complex mutations, such as short insertion and deletion (Indel)
and structural variations, are largely unknown, and an inappropri-
ate rate may result in dramatically reduced mutation calling
efficiency. Lastly, the evidence of mutations reported by these
callers has a less intuitive interpretation because of the entangle—
ment of the pre—specified mutation rate in the data likelihood
calculation.

To overcome these limitations, we developed a new de novo
calling algorithm, TrioDeNovo, which is a Bayesian framework that
evaluates evidence of DNM mainly based on the data and adjusts
post—hoc the effect of mutation rates on the calling through prior
odds. This is achieved through a Bayesian model selection approach,
in which it calculates the Bayes Factor (BF) of two models, namely
M1 that the offspring harbors at least one mutation in the two al—
leles, and M0 that the offspring’s genotype follows Mendelian trans—
mission. This approach of calculating de novo evidence (i.e. BF)
avoids the need for accurate specification of prior mutation rates
and has a natural interpretation as the relative likelihood of data
under two competing and mutually exclusive models. After evaluat—
ing BF, flexible prior mutation rates can be adjusted post—hoc to get
posterior odds of DNMs for different sites and different mutation
types according to prior knowledge. Through extensively simula-
tions and real datasets, we showed that the new framework im-
proves sensitivity and specificity over existing methods in detection
of DNMs, especially for moderate depth of coverage (e.g. 20X).
Coupled with our recently developed method for effective filtering
of alignment artifacts, we hope that this new framework is useful to
the research community for accurate DNM calling to facilitate the
identification of genetic factors for human disease.

2 Methods
2.1 DNM calling algorithm

TrioDeNovo uses a Bayesian model selection framework for DNM
calling. The input to TrioDeNovo is a variant calling format (VCF)
(Danecek et al., 2011) file, which can be generated using widely
used tools such as GATK (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al.,
2010) and Samtools (Li et al., 2009). TrioDeNovo extracts genotype
likelihood (GL) values stored in the VCF file for mutation modeling.
GL is defined as the probability of observing aligned reads, denoted
as R, at a specific position given a specific underlying genotype G,
i.e. P(R|G). The basic idea is to consider all bases aligned at a
specific position on the genome as a series of Bernoulli trials, each
with an empirically calibrated error rate specifying the probability
that the observed base is different from the true allele. The simplest
calculation of the GL assumes that sequencing errors are independ—
ent and more sophisticated error models incorporate inter—
dependency of sequencing errors (see Li et al., 2009, 2012 for
details). The benefit of utilizing pre—calculated GL values stored
in VCF files is to take advantage of accurate GL values generated
by highly specialized tools such as GATK and Samtools. It is stand—
ard for state—of—the—art variant calling methods to output GLs in
VCF files and therefore TrioDeNovo can continue to benefit from
the improvement made to the GL calculation by these specialized
tools.

For each site in the sequence data, we define two models, M1,
which represents the model that there is at least one mutation in
the offspring, and M0, which specifies the model that the genotypes
of the parent—offspring trio are consistent with Mendelian trans—
mission law. Define an allelic mutation model, K, as a matrix of
relative probabilities from parental alleles to mutant alleles,
conditional on that a mutation occurred. A simple model for single
nucleotide variant (SNV) mutations is illustrated in the matrix

below.
A C G T
A u a) u
C u u a)
G a) u u

T0601)

In this simplified model mutations are symmetric, all transitions
have the same mutation rate (co) as well as transversions (u), and
20 —I— a) = 1. Given a mutation rate, denoted as ,u and assumed to
be the same for all parental alleles, the absolute allelic mutation
rates can be calculated by multiplying ,u in the above matrix.
Other ﬂexible mutation models can be provided to TrioDeNovo
by the user if desired. In the allelic mutation model only one param-
eter is free and we let the transition 0) be the parameter of the
model.

Let R denote the aligned reads at a genome position for all indi-
viduals in a trio. The goal is to calculate the posterior odds of the
two models, given R and K, as the following:

P(M1IR) HR | M1) P(Mi)

 

><
P(Mo I R) P(R I M0) P(Mo)
In the above, W is the BF of the two models, and  is the
prior odds of the two models. A confident DNM is called when the
posterior odds is greater than a threshold, e.g. 1, indicating that mu—

 

tations are more likely than Mendelian transmission, a posterior.

Another way is to rank the candidates according to the posterior
odds and select the top candidates for further evaluation. In
TrioDeNovo, instead of reporting the posterior odds, which depends
on both BF and prior odds, we define de novo quality (DQ) based
on the BF only, i.e., DQ : log 10 GEE (  The benefit of this strat—

 

)
egy is that TrioDeNovo concentrates on model evaluation, which

is essentially unaffected by the prior mutation rate (see below), and

the prior odds  can be specified post—hoc so that different priors

 

can be used for different genomic regions. If there is a need to re—
adjust the prior for some candidates when better estimates of priors
are available this can be easily done without re—calling DNMs. To
adjust the prior odds, if we know the estimated mutation rate at a
locus, e.g. P(Ml), we can use that to approximate the prior odds as
P(MO) is close to 1. Often times we have the relative estimate of the
mutation rate of a particular locus relative to the genome average
mutation rate, denoted as Pg(M1). For example, if a locus is 10 times
more (or less) mutable than the genome average, a simple adjust—
ment is to add (or subtract) log10(10) : 1 to (or from) the DQ to get
adjusted DQ (DQadj). The ranking of the DQadi values incorporates
the differential prior odds of different genomic loci. The posterior
odds are obtained as 10DQadi+1°g10P g (M1) when knowledge is available
for Pg(M1). Regardless of the accuracy of Pg(M1) the order of poster—
ior odds remains the same as long as the relative mutability is prop—
erly specified.

The key component of the framework is the calculation of the
BF. Let p denote the alternative allele frequency in the population
at a specific genomic position, and others be defined as before. BF is
calculated as

Z P(R | M1)
P(R | M0)
(1mm,co,M1>P<pIM1>P<MIM1>P<wIModpdudw

BF

 

(P(RIp.Mo>P<pIMo>dp

In the above we assumed that a priori the allele frequency in parents,
the mutation rate and the transition probability are independent.
Instead of taking numerical integrations in calculating the BF, we
describe our rationales to simplify the model to increase computa—
tion efficiency.

2.1.1 Simplification of the prior of parameter p

Given the availability of an extensive catalog of genetic variation
with accurate estimates of allele frequencies by the 1000 Genomes
Project (1000GP), we can greatly simplify the calculation by con—
sidering only a single value in the prior distribution of the allele fre—
quency. At known variant sites we assign P(p|M1) and P(p|M0) to
1 for p that equals to the 1000GP estimate and 0 for others.
For non—variant sites we assign the corresponding prior probability
to 1 for p = 0.001 and to 0 for others; although estimates of actual
frequencies are not available, this assignment is expected to be close
to true values given that alternative alleles were not observed at
these sites in the 1000GP data. This simplification is expected to not
only increase the computation speed but also improve the accuracy
owing to the comprehensiveness of the current catalog of genetic
variation. Let [)0 denote the allele frequency in the 1000GP for
known variant sites, and p0 = 0.001 for others. The BF can be sim—
plified as

((HR | P0711, w,M1)P(MIM1)P(wIM1)dew
P(RIPO, M0)

 

BF: (n

2.1.2 Simplification of the prior of parameter n
For a given estimate p : [)0 as above, we calculate P(R|p0, II, 0), M1)
as the following:

 l pOMuawaMl)
:  l  l p071u7w7M1)
: ZGO,Gf,Gm P(R l G)P(Gf7 Gm l P0)P(Go l Gf7Gm71u7w7M1)
(2)

The term P(R | G): P(RO|GO)P(Rf|Gf)P(Rm|Gm) is the product
of the GLs of the trio, where R0, Rf and Rm denote the reads for off—
spring, father and mother respectively, and similarly Go, Gf and Gm
represent the corresponding genotypes of the trio. P(Gf, Gm | 1m) is
the frequency of the parental genotypes which can be calculated
based on the allele frequency [)0 assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilib-
rium, and P(G0|Gf,Gm,,u,co,M1) is the posterior probability of
observing the offspring’s mutant genotype from parental genotype
given mutation parameters It and a) under model M1. The same like—
lihood under M0 can be similarly calculated following Mendelian
transmission. To give a concrete example for M1, assuming that Gf
and Gm have genotype NA, there are nine possible mutant geno—
types (A/C, NG, NT, C/C, C/G, C/T, G/G, G/T and T/T), with a
total probability of 1 — (1 — ,u)2. For mutant genotype GozNG,
in which a transition mutation from A to G occurred in either
the transmitted paternal or maternal allele, we have

ZwMUr—M)

 2
1—0—M)

(3)

Assuming ,u<< 1 so that 1 — pm 1 and u2 m 0, the above is approxi-
mately equal to a). For a reasonable range of II, the approximation is
very accurate. For example, when ,u : 10_2, Equation (3) equals to
0.99497 X a), and when the mutation rate changes to ,u : 10_5, the
posterior is 0.999995 X a). It gets closer to a) when II gets lower.
This holds true for other scenarios in which a single mutation
occurred. For double mutants, however, the prior mutation rate has
a dramatic effect on the posterior probabilities. For example, the
posterior probability of G0 : G/G when parental genotypes are A/A
is ((011)2/(1 — (1 — u)2) mwzu/Z, indicating that double mutants con—
tribute a priori less than ,u times of single mutations to Equation (2).
Since double mutants are extremely rare, apparent double mutants
in data are more likely to be artifactual than genuine mutations
given extensive sequencing and alignment error in current NGS plat—
forms. Therefore, our focus here is on single allele mutations. In this
setting it is clear that the BF is largely unaffected by the prior muta—
tion rate and we calculated BF using a fixed value of ,u : 110 with the
default value of 10‘8. If we redefine M1 as the model in which only
single mutations are allowed, the BF is completely independent of ,u
under M1. Either case will give essentially the same result.

2.1.3 Simplification of the prior of parameter to

We have less information about the prior of a) on each genomic
region than other parameters and it may not be straightforward to
specify a realistic prior distribution. A natural option is to assume
that a priori 0) follows a Generalized Beta (GB) distribution

1

W<w—a>“‘1<b—w>ﬁ‘l

G300; 06, ﬂag: I?) =
where ogﬂ > 0, a g x g b. The GB distribution handles the situation
where a) is assumed to be within a sensible internal of [a,b].
When a = 0 and b = 1 it corresponds to the Beta distribution; when
or : ﬂ : 1 it is uniform distribution in [a,b].

On the other hand, we reasoned that transition mutation rates,
or equivalently the transition versus transversion (ti/to) ratios,
defined as co/2V, do not vary dramatically across the genome. Fixing
a reasonable value, e.g. ti/tv=2.0 for the genome level and
ﬁlm/2 3.0 for the exome level, has benefits of model simplification
and robustness. Assuming the pre—specified a) : coo, with the
default value of (0022/3 (corresponding to a ﬁlm/22.0), the BF is
calculated as follows:

_P(R | P0,Mo,wo,M1)

BF —
P(Rlp07M0) (3)

Since there is a one—to—one correspondence between a) and the ﬁlm)
ratio under model K, we used the more interpretable ti/tz/ ratio to
represent the model parameter, and different values of ﬁlm) ratios
can be specified at the command line of our tool. We investigated
the robustness of this approach and observed similar results as those
obtained using GB distributions (see Section 3).

Considering all of the above, we used the simplified version of
the BF implemented as in Equation (3) in evaluating its performance
in this study.

2.2 Genotype calling

After evaluating the evidence of DNM, individual genotypes are
inferred under M1. We calculate the likelihood of reads for each
father—mother—offspring genotype configuration in a trio, and take
the configuration with the highest likelihood as the inferred geno—
types for the trio. This can be achieved in Equation (2) in which the
summands correspond to the likelihoods of reads for individual joint
trio genotypes. Denote the mostly likely genotype configuration as
Gbest. The quality of the joint genotype calling under M1 is calcu—

lated as GQ : _1010g10 P(R|G$?1){1|;f::‘g:ﬁl’g‘mMﬂ, where all terms are

 

calculated in Equation (2).

2.3 Simulated datasets

To simulate realistic sequencing data so that we can mimic both
sequencing and alignment errors, we used two CEU samples,
NA06984 and NA06986, from the 1000GP data to simulate paren—
tal genomes. We first constructed parental genomes based on the
haplotypes stored in the VCF files (March 16, 2012 Phase I release)
and the reference genome GRCh37; in this way we reconstructed in—
dividual genomes with both polymorphic and monomorphic sites.
SNV mutations were randomly placed on each of the parental
haplotypes according to a mutation rate of 5 X 10‘7 with equal
probability of mutating into any of the other three alleles from the
reference allele. The simulated parental haplotypes were randomly
transmitted to offspring to generate the offspring genome. We then
generated 75 bp paired—end sequence reads with an error rate of 1%
for each base. Reads were randomly drawn from the two haplotypes
in individual genomes. We repeated the simulation process until
the desired coverage was reached. In this study we simulated whole
genome data at approximately 17X, 34X, 51 X and 68 x.

Simulated paired—end reads were aligned to the reference genome
GRCh37 using BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009) (version 0.7.4) and the
BAM files were processed following best practice procedures includ—
ing duplicate removal by picard—tools—1.92 (http://picard.source—
forge.net/index.shtml), local Indel—realignment and base—quality
recalibration by GATK (DePristo et al., 2011; McKenna et al.,
2010) (version 2.5.2). Since DeNovoGear takes as input BCF files
generated by Samtools, we also used Samtools (version 0.1.19) to
generate the VCF files as input to TrioDeNovo so that both tools

use exactly the same GLs for a fair comparison; in this way the per-
formance difference is solely due to calling algorithms.

To assess the impact of the prior odds of the two models, %,
on the performance of DNM calling, we also simulated mutations
with different mutation rates based on the parental alleles.
Specifically, we arbitrarily assumed a mutation rate of 5 X 10_7 for

parental alleles A and C, and 5 X 10_9 otherwise. The corresponding
P(Mi) _ 5.0><10_7

P(Mo) _ 1—5.0x10-7
respectively. In TrioDeNovo we use these

 

prior odds of mutation for the two scenarios are
P(Ml) : 5.0x10—9

_ P(Mo) 1—5.0x10—9’ _ _ _
prlor odds when calculat1ng the posterlor odds on thls dataset.

 

and

2.4 Real datasets

We downloaded the 1000GP CEU trio high coverage whole genome
sequencing data (ftp://ftp—trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/ftp/
technical/working/20 120 1 1 7_ceu_trio_b37_decoy/CEUTrio.HiSeq.
WGS.b37_decoy.’1.clean.dedup.recal.20120117.bam). This trio was
studied for DNMs by the 1000GP and extensive experimental valid—
ation was performed on a large candidate mutation set (Conrad
et al., 2011; Ramu et al., 2013). The sequencing was done on cell
lines that also harbor somatic mutations. There are 48 germline mu-
tations and 888 cell line somatic mutations on autosomes that were
experimentally confirmed. The depth of coverage is 60X, 60x and
66x for father, mother and offspring, respectively. We followed
the same procedure as in the simulation to process the sequencing
data. We investigated the calling accuracy for germline and cell line
somatic mutations separately.

2.5 Performance evaluation

We evaluated the performance of TrioDenovo and DeNovoGear
(version 0.5.2) on both simulated and real data. DeNovoGear
(Ramu et al., 2013) is a recently developed DNM caller that was
shown to outperform existing methods such as PolyMutt (Li et al.,
2012) and Samtools (Li et al., 2009). We ranked the candidate
mutations according to the posterior probabilities for both
TrioDeNovo and DeNovoGear and used receiver operating charac—
teristic (ROC) curves to compare the sensitivity and specificity of
the candidates. For simulated data the metrics are easily calculated
since the true mutations are known. For the 1000GP trio whole gen—
ome sequencing data, although a large set of candidate mutations
was experimentally validated, the true false negatives are unknown.
We adopted a similar strategy used in the DeNovoGear article
(Ramu et al., 2013) for performance evaluation on real data.
Specifically, sensitivity was calculated relative to the number of
validated true mutations, and false discovery rates (FDRs) were
calculated as described in Ramu et al. (2013) and Supplementary
Figure S1. The metrics were calculated for germline and cell-line
somatic DNMs separately.

3 Results

3.1 Performance evaluation on simulation data

First we evaluated the impact of sequencing coverage on the sensitiv—
ity and specificity of TrioDeNovo. We carried out mutation calling
on simulated data with ﬂat prior odds. Figure 1 shows the ROC
curves at sequencing coverage of 17X, 34X, 51X and 68x. As ex-
pected, the power and accuracy improve as coverage increases
(Fig. 1). However, the gain of increasing coverage diminishes at
coverage of 34X or above, as manifested by similar ROC curves
(Fig. 1). For example, at false positive rate of 50, the sensitivity is
89.5% at 34x, and is increased to 93.4 and 94.3% for coverage
of 51X and 68X, respectively. On the other hand, the performance

is dramatically reduced at 17X, and to reach a sensitivity of 80%
the false positive rate is several times higher than that at 34x
(Fig. 1), indicating the importance of having sufficient coverage for
efficient DNM calling.

Next we compared the performance of TrioDeNovo with the
state—of—the—art DNM caller, DeNovoGear, on the same simulated
data as above. Due to the dependence of DeNovoGear on the prior
mutation rate (Ramu et al., 2013), we ran DeNovoGear using
three mutation rates, 104, 10‘8 and 10‘”, and compared the
results with that from TrioDeNovo. It is clear that the performance
of DeNovoGear significantly depends on the prior mutation rate
(Fig. 2A—C). For example, at 17x, the maximum achievable sensi—
tivity is 40.2% when 10_12 was used as the prior mutation rate,
and at 51 X and 68 X the false positive rates increased when a prior
mutation rate of 10_4 was used. On the contrary, TrioDeNovo is
insensitive to the prior mutation rate, and for all coverage investi—
gated it achieved better ROC curves than DeNovoGear even
though a wide range of mutation rates were used for DeNovoGear
(Fig. ZA—C).

Fig. 3. ROC curves of de novo germline SNV mutations called by TrioDeNovo
and DeNovoGear in the 1000GP CEU trio data with different coverage. ROC
curves were calculated on datasets with 25% (A), 75% (B) and 100% (C) of the
original whole genome data. Black lines represent TrioDeNovo calls with flat
prior odds. Green, orange and red lines represent DeNovoGear calls with
specified mutation rates of 10’8 (default), 10’4 and 10’”, respectively (color
version of this figure is available at Bioinformatics online.)

TrioDeNovo is not only insensitive to the prior mutation rate
but also flexible in assigning varying prior odds of mutations across
the genome. To evaluate the impact of prior odds, we ran both
TrioDeNovo and DeNovoGear on the simulated data in which
mutations were generated assuming different mutation rates (see
Section2). For TrioDeNovo calls we ranked the candidates accord—
ing to the posterior odds incorporating prior odds used in the simu—
lation. With proper priors, we observe that TrioDeNovo achieved
further improvement, and is superior to DeNovoGear for all three
prior mutations used (Fig. 2D—F). This improvement is evident
for all coverage investigated (Fig. 2D—F), making TrioDeNovo not
only robust but also flexible in assigning proper priors post hoc to
increase power.

We further evaluated the impact of the pre—specified transition
mutation rate, or equivalently ti/tz/ ratio on DNM calling.
Specifically we ran TrioDeNovo using a fixed prior ti/tz/ ratio of 2.0
on different datasets with true mutation ti/tz/ ratios in the rage of
1.0—6.0. For various sequencing coverage the ROC curves with dif—
ferent ti/tz/ ratios are very close (Supplementary Fig. S2), indicating
that the pre—specified ti/tz/ ratio has little impact on the mutation
calling. We also compared the results with those obtained using GB
distributions on a). For example, the correlation coefficient between
the DO values using a fixed ti/tz/ ratio of 2.0 and the DO values
using a uniform distribution of a) between 0 and 1 is over 0.99;
the correlation is higher when or :4 and ﬂ :2 were used in the GB
distribution, corresponding to a GB with mean ﬁlm) of 2.0 and
smaller variance. This holds true as well for GB distributions when
a) was confined in reasonable intervals such as [0.1,0.9].

3.2 Performance evaluation on real data

We first evaluated the mutation calling accuracy on the confirmed
germline mutations in the 1000GP CEU trio using the same calling
strategies as for simulated data. When the same prior odds were
assumed, TrioDeNovo outperformed DeNovoGear for all prior mu-
tation rates used for DeNovoGear (Fig. 3C). For an FDR of 70%,
TrioDeNovo achieved a sensitivity of 100%, while the maximum
sensitivity for DeNovoGear is 95.8%, which is achieved when an
unrealistic mutation rate of 10_4 was used. We also investigated the
impact of sequencing coverage on mutation calling accuracy in this
trio, and carried out mutation calling with reduced coverage by sub—
sampling 75 and 25% of the reads from the original alignment files.
Although the overall patterns when 75% of the data were used are
similar to these in the full data, the impact of prior mutation rate
on DeNovoGear calls becomes more dramatic for lower coverage, as
indicated by a reduced sensitivity when a mutation rate of 10‘12 was
used (Fig. 3B). When only 25 % of the data were used, TrioDeNovo

showed its greater advantage over DeNovoGear (Fig. 3A). For ex—
ample, the maximum achievable sensitivity for DeNovoGear is
54.2%, and including more candidates does not recover real muta—
tions; on the other hand, TrioDeNovo achieves higher sensitivity
without sacrificing specificity, and more real mutations were dis—
covered when more candidates were included (Fig. 3A). We also car—
ried out the same evaluation on the cell line somatic mutations and
observed similar patterns (Supplementary Fig. S3).

False DNMs are often due to alignment artifacts, which are
often uncaptured by current calling methods. We recently developed
a machine-learning filtering tool, DNMFilter, which can effectively
capture alignment artifacts and filter false positives (Liu et al.,
2014). We investigated whether such a filtering scheme can be com—
bined with TrioDeNovo to provide the research community a reli—
able pipeline that can further improve the accuracy of DNM calling.
We re—calculated sensitivity and FDR of the candidates that passed
the DNMFilter cutoff of 0.6. We observe significant improvements
of germline mutation accuracy of TrioDeNovo calls on the full data
(Fig. 4C), and the improvement is more pronounced when 75 and
25 % of the data were used (Fig. 4A and B). For example, to achieve
80% sensitivity with 25 % of the data, the FDR is 83% without
filtering, and it is reduced to 63.6% when DNMFilter was used
(Fig. 4A), indicating the effectiveness of DNMFilter in capturing
false positives. For somatic mutations, we observed the same overall
patterns of improvements after application of DNMFilter, although
the effectiveness is not as dramatic as for germline mutations
(Supplementary Fig. S4), probably due to unusual characteristics
of cell line somatic mutations.

4 Discussion

Sequencing trios with sporadic—affected offspring has enabled the
demystification of certain rare diseases and identification of genes
implicated in complex disorders. Such a strategy will continue to be
employed to decipher the genetic basis of disease. In this study, we
developed an efficient and ﬂexible framework to facilitate the DNM
calling in parents—proband trios. The key advantage of our new
method is the decoupling of mutation rates from evaluation of the
data and the flexibility of adjusting the prior mutation odds post—
hoc irrelevant of the data. This feature is important since DNM
rates vary widely across the genome, and different classes of muta—
tions exhibit varying mutation patterns. For example, the mutation
rate for CpG dinucleotides is 9.5—fold that of non—CpG bases
(Campbell et al., 2012). It is evident that mutation rates depend on
multiple factors in a complex fashion, and it is not clear how contri—
buting factors act together to inﬂuence the underlying mutations
rate. With more families being sequenced, knowledge of DNMs is
being accumulated quickly so that genome—wide mutation patterns

can be soon accurately assessed. With such knowledge of prior
mutation rates, TrioDeNovo is expected to further facilitate the
DNM calling for the research community. Users have ﬂexibility
of adjusting the ranking of candidate mutations based on their
knowledge without re—calling the mutations. Even in its simplest
form with ﬂat prior odds, TrioDeNovo outperformed existing state—
of—the—art methods. Although tested on whole genome sequencing,
TrioDeNovo can be equally applicable to exome sequencing data.
The information used in TrioDeNovo is the pileup of bases aligned
to each of the positions in the genome, and the alignment of reads
from whole genome and exome data has similar accuracy in that
regard.

The quality scores from TrioDeNovo have a natural interpret—
ability as a BF. For example, a DO value of 9 indicates that the like—
lihood of mutation is 109 times of that without mutation. If a prior
mutation rate of 10_9 is assumed, the candidate shows reasonable
evidence of being a true mutation, and for a mutation rate of 10T8,
a 10-fold increase of likelihood is given to this candidate. Such an
interpretation is intuitive, and the adjustment does not require
re-calling. On the other hand, the posteriors from other methods,
e.g. DeNovoGear and Polymutt, do not have such a natural inter—
pretation. These algorithms calculate the likelihood of data by a
mixture of distributions of both Mendelian transmissions (M0) and
DNMs (M1) in the same model. The relative contribution of M1 and
M0 in the model is determined by the mutation rate, making the
model sensitive to the pre—specified prior. Moreover, the relative
ranking of candidates of DeNovoGear calls could change for the
same data when different priors were used, which is rather
undesirable.

Tools specialized for variant calling continue to improve the GL
calculation and it is standard that these tools output GLs in the VCF
file. By taking VCF files as input, TrioDeNovo can continuously bene—
fit from these improvements without changing the interface.
Furthermore, TrioDeNovo can be applied to VCF files generated by
different tools, e.g. GATK, Samtools, FreeBayes and others, so that a
consensus call set can be generated. The consensus approach has been
shown to generate high—quality calls (Nielsen et al., 2011),
and TrioDeNovo enables the consensus calling by integrating
GLs calculated from various tools through the standard VCF
input. In addition, TrioDeNovo runs very fast due to its efficient
implementation so that consensus calling can be carried out efficiently.

TrioDeNovo calculates the mutation evidence based on the
GLs at individual positions. Alignment artifacts are usually not well
captured in the GLs and therefore can introduce false positive calls.
Although VCF files contain some information about alignments, the
information is insufficient to effectively distinguish real and artifac—
tual mutations. We previously developed a machine—learning ap-
proach, DNMFilter, for filtering by incorporating rich features in
bam files. DNMFilter was initially trained using exome sequencing
data and showed improved accuracy on the 1000GP whole genome
sequencing. We will further exploiting a training set of whole
genome DNMs when more data are available. We hope that
TrioDeNovo equipped with DNMFilter provides a powerful tool
for mutation detection in trios for both targeted and whole genome
sequencing. The C—I——I— source code implementing TrioDeNovo
and related resources are available on the authors’ website (https://
medschool.vanderbilt.edu/cgg).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: It has been claimed in the literature that pooling DNA
samples is efficient in estimating haplotype frequencies. There is,
however, no theoretical justification based on calculation of statistical
efficiency. In fact, the limited evidence given so far is based on
simulation studies with small numbers of loci. With rapid advance
in technology, it is of interest to see if pooling is still efficient when
the number of loci increases.

Methods: Instead of resorting to simulation studies, we make use
of asymptotic statistical theory to perform exact calculation of the
efficiency of pooling relative to no pooling in the estimation of
haplotype frequencies. As an intermediate step, we use the log-linear
formulation of the haplotype probabilities and derive the asymptotic
variance—covariance matrix of the maximum likelihood estimators of
the canonical parameters of the log-linear model.

Results: Based on our calculations under linkage equilibrium,
pooling can suffer huge loss in efficiency relative to no pooling when
there are more than three independent loci and the alleles are not
rare. Pooling works better for rare alleles. In particular, if all the minor
allele frequencies are 0.05, pooling maintains an advantage over no
pooling until the number of independent loci reaches 6. High linkage
disequilibrium effectively reduces the number of independent loci by
ruling out certain haplotypes from occurring. Similar calculations of
efficiency for the case of no pooling justify the common belief that
it is not worthwhile to use molecular methods to resolve the phase
ambiguity of individual genotype data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Pooling DNA samples is a common cost-effective practice in genetic
association studies, especially for the purpose of initial screening
(Bansal et al., 2002; Barcellos et al., 1997; Norton et al., 2004;
Pearson et al., 2007; Sham et al., 2002; Zuo et al., 2006). Large
pools of DNA samples also come up in forensic studies (Homer et al.,
2008; Jacobs et al., 2009). To facilitate haplotype-based association
analysis, it is necessary to estimate haplotype frequencies from
pooled DNA data, and many algorithms, mainly the expectation
maximization (EM) algorithm and its variants (Ito et al., 2003;
Kierkpatrick et al., 2007; Kuk et al., 2009; Niu, 2004; Wang et al.,

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

2003; Yang et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2008), have been proposed
in the literature. However, the emphasis of these papers is very
much algorithmic and numerical, focusing on computing speed and
numerical convergence, rather than on the statistical property and
efﬁciency of the estimates being computed. This is unfortunate,
because even if the best available algorithm is used to compute,
say, the maximum likelihood estimate (MLE), it will be of no use
if the estimator itself does not possess good statistical property.
What we meant by the statistical property of an estimator is its
performance under repeated sampling from the postulated model.
Thus, we are concerned about quantities such as bias, variance and
also coverage in the case of interval estimation. To compute the
estimation efﬁciency of one estimator relative to another, we adopt
the usual deﬁnition of taking the ratio of the variance (or mean
squared error for biased estimators) of estimator 2 to that of estimator
1. In this article, estimator 1 is the MLE based on pooled genotype
data, and estimator 2 is the MLE based on individual genotype
data. The number of pools used in estimator 1 and the number of
individuals used in estimator 2 are kept equal so that the genotyping
costs of the two estimators are the same.

Given the large body of work on haplotype estimation based on
pooled data, it will be important for practitioners to know when to
pool and when not to pool. Yang et al. (2003) believed that pooling
DNA samples is efﬁcient in estimating haplotype frequencies. In
particular, they demonstrated that although pooling K individuals
increases ambiguities, the uncertainty of ML estimation increases
less than K times that of unpooled DNA, at least for small pool
sizes and small number of loci. Thus, for the same genotyping
cost, the pooled data MLE will be more efﬁcient than the MLE
computed from individual genotype data. Their comparison was
limited to the case of small number of loci. Due to rapid advance in
technology, huge numbers of SNPs are genotyped routinely, and it
would be interesting to ﬁnd out what happens when the number of
loci increases.

Our study differs from Yang et al. (2003) in that our reported
efﬁciencies are based on theoretical calculations using asymptotic
variance formulae rather than based on simulations. By carrying
out theoretical calculations, we avoid some of the shortcomings
of simulation studies and can handle more loci. Our ﬁndings, for
the case of linkage equilibrium and non-rare allele, suggest that
pooling begins to lose estimation efﬁciency (relative to no pooling
at the same genotyping cost) when the number of loci is larger
than 3. Other factors affecting the efﬁciency of pooling that have
been mentioned in the literature include sparsity (Barratt et al.,
2002), linkage disequilibrium (LD) and allele frequencies (Kirk
and Cardon, 2002). Barratt et al. (2002) commented that it is not
necessarily the case that pooling will lead to loss of haplotype

Efficiency of pooling in haplotype estimation

 

information when LD is so strong that only a small number of
haplotypes will occur with appreciable frequency. Kirk and Cardon
(2002) deﬁned high haplotype complexity by ‘low LD, common
alleles’ and low haplotype complexity by ‘high LD and/or many rare
alleles’. Another aim of this article is to unify and reconcile all these
claims with our ﬁndings. One way to think about LD is that it reduces
the ‘effective number of independent loci’ by reducing the number
of non-rare haplotypes. Thus, if the L loci can be grouped into B
blocks with high LD within blocks and low LD between blocks, then
the situation is similar to the case of B independent loci. We report
some efﬁciency calculations to support this conjecture. The effect
of rare alleles is also to reduce the number of non-rare haplotypes
to just a few. Instead of having 8, 16 and 32 possible haplotypes for
the cases of 3, 4 and 5 loci, if all the minor allele frequencies are
small, we will argue later that there are only 4, 5 and 6 haplotypes
with non—negligible probabilities when the number of loci is 3, 4
and 5. As a result, it will take a larger number of independent loci
for pooling to lose efﬁciency relative to no pooling for rare alleles.
For example, we show that if all the minor allele frequencies are
0.05, then pooling begins to lose efﬁciency when there are 6 (rather
than 4) independent loci. When there is no rare allele, the normal
guideline of not to pool when the effective number of independent
loci is more than 3 is applicable.

2 THEORY

In order to derive the asymptotic variances of estimated haplotype
frequencies, we reparameterize haplotype frequencies by using a
log—linear model representation. In this section, we ﬁrst calculate the
asymptotic variances of estimated log odds ratios in the log-linear
model under the assumption of linkage equilibrium, then compute
the asymptotic variances of estimated haplotype frequencies by
using the delta method. Let L be the number of loci in each
DNA strand,  the binary allele at locus j, and Y=(Y1,...,YL)
denote the haplotype. There are various ways to parameterize the
distribution of multivariate binary data such as Y=(Y1,..., YL).
We shall start with the canonical parameters because they are the
simplest mathematically and they are not constrained. Under this
log—linear formulation (Fitzmaurice et al., 1993; Liang et al., 1992),
the probability distribution of Y =(Y1, ..., YL) is given by

L
(L) (L)
P<Y=y) =C("‘)e"p (2%- W + Z “jg-#1142
J Jl<12 (1)
L L
+ Z a;ﬂ:l.3yj1yj2yj3 +"'+O‘(12)...LY1)’2---yL)’

j1<j2<j3

where y=(yl,y2,...,yL) is a realization of Y=(Y1,...,YL), C(05)
is the normalizing constant and \II={0,1}L is the collection of
all possible L-tuples of 0’s or 1’s. As pointed out by Liang
et al. (1992), the canonical parameters 05 have interpretations as
the log-conditional odds, log-conditional odds ratios and higher
order log-conditional odds ratios, which are deﬁned as contrasts
of log-conditional odds ratios. For example,

 

ex (“(L))=P(Y1=1|Y2=...=YL=0)
p 1 P(Y1=0|Y2=...=YL=0)9

 

 

exp(a(1[é))=P(Y1=1,Y2=1|Y3=---=YL=0)
P(Y1=1,Y2=0|Y3=---=YL=0)
P(Y1 =0, Y2=0|Y3=---=YL =0)

XP(Y1=0,Y2=1|Y3=---=YL=0),

and so on. Note that 05%) and 0512—1) have different interpretations

because the conditioning sets are different. While the canonical
parameters are easier to handle mathematically, it is more
meaningful to talk about the unconditional odds and odds ratio
P( Y1 = 1)

ex = —,

P(Y1 = 1, Y2 = 1)P(Y1 =0, Y2 =0)
P(Y1 =1, Y2 =0)P(Y1 =0, Y2 = 1) ,
and so on. Because these are parameters for the unconditional
marginal distributions, there is no need to add superscripts to the
10’s like what we did for the a’s. One useful observation is

L
a§2?..L=w12...L

because the conditioning set of L is empty, and so L can

be interpreted unconditionally.

By making use of the method of efﬁcient score, we prove in
Appendix A (Section A1) that as the number of pools n p increases,
the asymptotic variance of the MLE of L = W12...L based on
pooled allele frequencies at L loci which are at linkage equilibrium
and K individuals in each pool, is given by

 

eXPWiz) =

(2K)L—2
L—, (2)
"P H Pj(1—Pj)

j=1
where pj =P(Yj :1).

By applying the same argument to m <L, we can conclude that
the asymptotic variance under linkage equilibrium of the MLE of
a§:?"m=w12...m based on pooled data for the ﬁrst m loci only
is also given by (2), with m in place of L. But since the pooled
allele frequencies at the remaining L —m loci contain no additional
information about «pawn, under linkage equilibrium, the MLE of
wan," based on pooled data at all L loci has the same asymptotic
variance as the MLE based on the ﬁrst m loci alone. This heuristic
argument can be made precise and a rigorous proof can be provided
on request. Thus the asymptotic variance (under linkage equilibrium)
of the MLE of «pawn, based on the pooled allele frequencies at all
L loci will still be given by (2) with m in place of L.

The results presented thus far pertain to the estimation of the
unconditional log odds ratios 10’s. What the scientists are more
interested in estimating are the haplotype probabilities given by (1).
To obtain the asymptotic variance of the haplotype frequency
estimates, we ﬁrst obtain the asymptotic variance—covariance matrix
VK (oz) of the pooled data MLE of the canonical parameters
a’s. An outline of how to do this is given in Appendix A
(Section A2). Next, since P(Y= y) for each y is a function
of the canonical parameters according to (1), the asymptotic
variance VK(y) of its MLE is Dy VK(oz)D; by the delta method,
where Dy is the derivative of P(Y= y) with respect to 05.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Efﬁciency in estimating unconditional log odds
ratios

We ﬁrst compute the asymptotic relative efﬁciency (ARE) of the
pooled data MLE of $12...m,m5L, to the unpooled data MLE
(i.e. K = 1) as the following ratio of two asymptotic variances

(2)m—2 (2K)m—2

ARE($12...m)= m— / m—
nPl—le(1_Pj) anpJ-(l—pj) (3)
i=1 j=1


It follows that for estimating the locus-speciﬁc log odds wj,
corresponding to m = 1, ARE is given by K 2‘1 = K which is always
greater than 1 since the pool size K is at least 2. Thus, pooling
gains efﬁciency for estimating ﬁrst-order quantities like wj, bearing
in mind that we are not comparing the estimate based on n pools
of K individuals each with the estimate based on nK individuals,
but rather with the estimate based on 11 individuals, so that the
genotyping costs are the same.

For estimating the unconditional log odds ratio wjk at two loci,

m=2, and the ARE is K2T2=1, meaning that the pooled and
unpooled data MLEs are equally efﬁcient. For estimating ijl, the

ARE is K2T3 =K_1 < 1 , and so pooling will lose efﬁciency. For
estimating wjklm, the ARE is K2T4 =KT2, which is worse.

While it is not a big surprise that we cannot estimate higher
order association parameters well from pooled DNA data, it is quite
amazing to discover that there is an efﬁciency ladder. It is neat to
be able to work out precisely the exact orders (in powers of K, the
pool size) of the asymptotic variance of the pooled data MLE of the
different parameters. Equation (3) is revealing because it tells us that
the ARE of pooling versus no pooling in estimating the (m—1)-th
order log odds-ratio 1012mm is reduced by a factor of K whenever
m is increased by 1.

Table 1 summarizes what happen for up to the case of 8 loci. The
numbers in the ﬁrst column are the numbers of 1p parameters for
which pooling gains efﬁciency in estimation. In the next column
are the numbers of 1p parameters for which pooling and no pooling
are equally efﬁcient. Further right are the numbers of 1p parameters
for which pooling loses efﬁciency in estimation, and notice that
the farther out we go to the right of the table, the heavier is the
loss in efﬁciency. We can see from Table 1 that for the case of
two loci, there are no 1p parameters with ARE less than 1. For
the case of three loci, there are three wj’s for which the pooled
data MLE is better, three wjk’s for which pooling and no pooling
are asymptotically equivalent, and pooling is worse (ARE: K ‘1)
only for the estimation of 10123. These explain the ﬁndings of Yang
et al. (2003) that pooling is efﬁcient in estimating the haplotype
probabilities P(Y= y), which are functions of the w’s, when there
are only two or three loci. But Table 1 also tells us that the same
cannot be expected to hold true when the number of loci is 4 or more.

can be estimated by the pooled data MLE for the case of L = 2 to 8 loci

L=7 7 21 35 35 21 7 1

L=8 8 28 56 70 56 28 8 1

 

The numbers shown are the number of parameters in each group and K is the pool size.

For the case of four loci, there are four 1p parameters which can be
estimated from pooled data with ARE=K >1, 6 parameters with
ARE: 1, 4 parameters with ARE=K‘1 < 1, and 1 parameter with
ARE=K‘2 << 1. On this ground, we expect pooling to begin to
lose efﬁciency in the estimation of haplotype frequencies when there
are four loci. This is conﬁrmed by theoretical calculations to be
reported later. Things should get progressively worse as the number
of loci L increases. One can see from Table 1 that as L increases,
there will be more and more higher order parameters for which
pooling will do progressively worse, since the ARE decreases by a
factor of K every time we move to the right by one column.

3.2 Efﬁciency for haplotype frequency estimates

For haplotype frequency estimation, we can deﬁne the asymptotic
efﬁciency of pooling relative to no pooling by

an/ 2m». (4)

where K is the number of individuals in each pool, VK(y) is the
variance of the MLE of P(Y= y), and \II= {0, 1}L. As described at
the end of Section 2, this ratio can be calculated theoretically for
different choices of the number of loci L, minor allele frequencies
and pool size K. To reduce the number of conﬁgurations, we select
the minor allele frequencies to be equally spaced between 0.1 and
0.3. The results are summarized in Table 2. It can be seen that pooling
loses efﬁciency in the estimation of haplotype frequencies when the
number of loci is 4 or more, as one could have guessed from Table 1.
Pooling will lose efﬁciency even for the case of three loci, when
the pool size reaches 5 or more. For every ﬁxed pool size K (i.e.
column of Table 2), the efﬁciency of pooling decreases rapidly as
the number of loci L increases. It decreases with pool size when
L 3 3. The efﬁciency loss can be really huge. In fact, the efﬁciency
of pooling relative to no pooling is no greater than 20% when the
number of loci is 5 or more and the pool size is at least 4.

To show how the variances of the haplotype frequency estimates
grow as the number of loci increases, the lower panel of Table 2
displays the sum of the asymptotic variances of the haplotype
frequency estimates. For calibration purposes, the ﬁgures are divided
by 2L (the total number of possible haplotypes) so that they can be
interpreted as the average variances over all possible haplotypes.
The numbers are further multiplied by np, the number of pools,
to remove their dependence on np. We observe that the average

variance decreases with L when the pool size is 1. They are more or
less constant when the pool size is 2. For pool size larger than 2, the
average variance increases with L, and more rapidly the larger L is.
Note that if we divide the ﬁrst column of the lower panel of Table 2 by
the remaining columns, we recover the relative efﬁciencies displayed
in the upper panel which always decay when the number of loci
increases regardless of pool size.

In addition to the scenario of equally spaced minor allele
frequencies between 0.1 and 0.3, we also follow Kirk and Cardon
(2002) and consider the cases where the minor allele frequencies are
0.5, 0.1 or 0.05 across all markers. The ﬁrst situation will lead to
many distinct haplotypes and the last situation will lead to very few
haplotypes with appreciable probabilities and so they are at two ends
of the sparsity spectrum. Based on our earlier argument, we expect
pooling to fare better for rare alleles and this is conﬁrmed by Table 3.
Note that there is severe loss in efﬁciency due to pooling, even for
the case of three loci, when the minor allele frequency is 0.5. For
allele frequency 0.1, pooling begins to lose efﬁciency relative to no
pooling when the number of loci is 4 or more. However, when the
minor allele frequency is 0.05, we observe from Table 3 that pooling
is more efﬁcient than no pooling until we reach six or seven loci,
and not the usual four loci that we have been advocating so far.

There is an explanation why pooling is expected to fare better for
rare alleles. Let p be the minor allele frequency which is assumed to
be small and constant over loci, the 2L possible haplotypes can be
grouped according to the size of their probabilities of occurrence.
Obviously, P(0, ...,0) = (1 —p)L is of order 0(1) as p goes to
zero. The next frequent batch of haplotypes are the unit vectors
(1,0,...,0),...,(0,...,0,1), containing one ‘1’ and L—1 zeros with
probability of occurrence P(1, 0, . . . ,0) =p(1 — p)L_1 = 0(p). All
other haplotype probabilities will be of order 0(p2) or smaller.
Thus, out of the possible 2L haplotypes, only L+1 of them have
non—negligible probabilities of occurrence. Following through the
above argument, we have P(1,0,...,0)%P1(1),...,P(0,...,0,1)%
PL(1), where P1(1), . . . ,PL(1) are the locus-speciﬁc probability for

allele ‘1’. These locus-speciﬁc or marginal probabilities can be
estimated accurately from the corresponding sample proportions and
the precision of a sample proportion depends only on the number
of individuals in the sample whether it is pooled or not. In our
setup of equal genotyping cost, there are K times more individuals
under pooling compared with no pooling, where K is the pool size.
Thus, it is not surprising that pooling does better than no pooling
in estimating haplotype frequencies for very rare alleles. As to how
rare is rare, Table 3 suggests that a minor allele frequency of 0.1 is
still within the domain of applicability of the usual guideline. When
all the minor allele probabilities are 0.05, pooling has an advantage
over no pooling until we reach six or seven loci. When half the
minor allele frequencies are 0.01 and the other half are 0.05 (not
reported in Table 3), pooling only begins to lose efﬁciency when
the number of loci is 10. Further calculations suggest that pooling is
more efﬁcient than no pooling when all the minor allele frequencies
equal 0.01.

3.3 Effects of genotyping error

We have assumed perfect genotype data thus far. In practice, there
will be error in genotyping. The effects of not accounting for
genotyping errors in haplotype estimation have been studied by
a number of authors using different models of genotyping errors,
which are assumed to occur independently across markers. Kirk
and Cardon (2002) reported that ‘genotyping error can signiﬁcantly
decrease haplotype frequency and reconstruction accuracy’. The
emphasis of that paper was on the comparison of genotyping families
versus unrelated individuals in the presence of genotyping error

and pooling was not considered. By using a uniform distribution of
error for 0—10% randomly chosen individuals for whom Pr(observed
genotype | underlying genotype) is the same for all possible
genotypes, they might have exaggerated the effect of genotyping
error by giVing too much weight to large errors. More relevant to
our theme of comparing pooling with no pooling, Quade et al. (2005)
considered estimation of haplotype frequencies from pooled DNA
samples when there is genotyping error and concluded that ‘the
EM algorithm performs well even in the presence of genotyping
error’ and that genotyping error only ‘slightly decreases the accuracy
of haplotype frequency estimates’. However, they studied the two-
marker case only and their om-binomial model of observed genotype
given true genotype was primarily an inﬂated variance model rather
than one inducing a systematic bias. A third model of genotyping
error proposed by Zou and Zhao (2003) assumed that genotyping
error was introduced independently into each marker of each
chromosome. We will use this model to demonstrate the effect of
genotyping error because it is more amenable to theoretical analysis.
For biallelic (0 and 1) marker, let 60 be the probability of miscalling
a ‘0’ as a ‘1’, and 61 the probability of miscalling a ‘1’ as a
‘0’. It follows that if pj is the probability of allele 1 at marker j,
then the probability of actually observing allele 1 will be given
by pj’i‘zpj(1—61)+(1—pj)60, which does not equal pj in general,
hence creating a bias. Under linkage equilibrium, the true haplotype
probabilities that we wish to estimate are P(y) 21—1191)? (1 —pj)1—yj
for all L-tuples y=(yl,y2, ...,yL) of 0’s and 1’s, but the observed
data actually follow the distribution P*(y)=1_[p]’."yi(1—p]’.")(1_yf).
Neglecting genotyping error, we are effectively estimating P*(y)
rather than P(y), leading to a bias of b(y)=P*(y)—P(y), and the
asymptotic variance of the estimator will have the same form as
before, but evaluated at P*(y) rather than P(y). To take bias into
account, we should deﬁne the efﬁciency of pooling relative to no
pooling by the ratio of the sums of mean squared errors rather than
the sums of variances. Thus (4) should be replaced by

where we have used VI”; (y) to denote VK (y) evaluated at p*.
To illustrate, we assume 60 = 61 = 0.05 and obtain Table 4 instead of
Table 2 for the efﬁciencies of pooling relative to no pooling when
np = 50. Comparing Table 4 with Table 2, we can see that genotyping
error changes the relative efﬁciencies only slightly and the change

is toward 1 because the squared bias term 23,91,199) is common
to both the numerator and denominator of the expression above. We
will assume no genotyping error in the remainder of this article.

3.4 Efﬁciency under LD

While the preceding results are derived under linkage equilibrium,
we can expect the same to hold true near linkage equilibrium. To
gain some insights into what happens when there are moderate
to high LD, we will carry out some efﬁciency calculation. To
make it amenable to theoretical calculation without the need
to resort to simulation studies, we consider the case where
the loci can be grouped into blocks of size 2 each, with
independence between blocks, and with intra-block LD coefﬁcient
D’ =0,0.25,0.5,0.75,0.99. The minor allele frequencies are the
same within blocks and equally spaced from 0.1 to 0.3 between
blocks. We denote these block size 2 models by 2—2, 2—2—2 and
so on. Thus, under model 2—2, the probability of the occurrence
of haplotype (1,1,1,1) is {0.12+D’(0.1)(0.9)}{0.32 +D’(0.3)(0.7)}.
In general, D’ :0 corresponds to the case of L=2B independent
loci, where B is the number of blocks, and the effective number of
independent loci reduces from 2B to B when D’ =0.99. By ﬁxing
the block size at 2, we are able to express the expected Fisher’s
information matrix in terms of certain quantities involving the non-
central hypergeometric distribution (Xu et al., 2008) which can
be calculated accurately (Liao and Rosen, 2001). In Appendix A
(Section A3), the derivation of the asymptotic variance—covariance
matrix of the MLE of haplotype frequencies for model 2—2 is given.
The derivations for models 2—2—2 and 2—2—2—2 can be similarly
obtained.

The efﬁciencies of pooling relative to no pooling for estimating
haplotype frequencies under these block size 2 models are reported
in Table 5. Since many haplotypes have negligible probabilities of
occurring under high LD, it may not be reasonable to include the
variances of their estimates in the sums appearing in the numerator
and denominator of (4). As an alternative measure, we consider
thresholding the sums by including V1 (y) and VK(y) in the sums
only when P(Yzy) exceeds a threshold. We consider a haplotype
probability to be lower than the threshold if P(Y: y) 5 c/2L for
two choices of c, 0 and 0.1. The use of c=0 corresponds to no
thresholding, whereas the choice c :01 would exclude a haplotype
from the summations in (4) if its probability is less than or equal
to one-tenth of the uniform probability 1 /2L for the case of L loci.
It can be seen from Table 5 that the effect of thresholding on the
resulting relative efﬁciencies are minimal and so we will concentrate
on the non-threshold version in the following discussion.

When D’ :0, all the loci are independent, which is why the ﬁrst
rows for models 2—2, 2—2—2 and 2—2—2—2 are close to the ‘L=4’,
‘L = 6’ and ‘L = 8’ rows of Table 2. They are close but not identical
because the marginal minor allele frequencies are different. To be
speciﬁc, model 2—2 in Table 5 corresponds to the case p1 =p2 :01
and p3 = p4 :03, whereas the four loci case of Table 2 is for 191 =
0.1,p2 =0.167,p3 =0.233 andp4 :03. We observe also that the last
rows under models 2—2, 2—2—2 and 2—2—2—2 in Table 5 are very close
to the ‘L=2’, ‘L=3’ and ‘L=4’ rows of Table 2. This veriﬁes our
intuition that the B-block model reduces to the case of B independent
loci when D’ is large. Another observation from Table 5 is that the
efﬁciency of pooling increases with D’, which underlies why high
LD is sometimes used to justify pooling. This phenomenon can again

be explained by the fact that the effective number of independent
loci decreases as LD increases. The efﬁciency of pooling is always
less than 1 in Table 5 for model 2—2—2—2 because the effective
number of independent loci is at least 4. Pooling can be more efﬁcient
than no pooling for model 2—2—2, but only when D’ 20.99, so that
there are effectively only three independent loci, and when the pool
size K is less than 5. The results for the case of intermediate LD
are expectedly in between those for linkage equilibrium and high
LD. The ‘D’ 2075’ row under model 2—2 is peculiar in that the
efﬁciency is not monotonic, but ﬁrst increases with pool size and then
decreases. An explanation of this unusual behavior is that according
to Table 2, the efﬁciency decreases with pool size when the number
of independent loci is 3, but increases with pool size when there are
only two loci (which in turn can be explained by Table 1). When

D’ = 0.75, the effective number of independent loci for model 2—2 is
somewhere between 2 and 3 and hence the non-monotonic behavior.

4 DISCUSSION

We have shown in this article that contrary to the ﬁndings of
Yang et al. (2003), pooling loses efﬁciency relative to no pooling
in the estimation of haplotype frequencies when the number of
independent loci is more than 3 and the alleles are not rare. Rare
alleles cause sparsity which favors pooling. When the minor allele
frequency is 0.05, pooling is more efﬁcient than no pooling until the
number of independent loci reaches 6 or 7. Rarer alleles will favor
pooling even more. The effect of high LD is also to cause sparsity
which allows pooling to maintain an advantage over no pooling for
a larger number of loci than is possible under linkage equilibrium.
To apply the guidelines derived under the assumption of linkage
equilibrium, we ﬁnd it useful to think in terms of the effective
number of independent loci. For example, for model 2—2—2—2,
the effective number of independent loci is 8 when D’ :0 and 4
when D’ =0.99. By interpolation, it seems reasonable to treat the
cases D’ =0.25,0.5,0.75 like there are 7, 6 and 5 independent loci,
respectively, and this is substantiated by comparing Table 2 with
Table 5.

To summarize, the main ﬁnding of this article is that for non-rare
alleles and for the same genotyping cost, pooling loses efﬁciency
relative to no pooling in the estimation of haplotype frequencies
when the number of independent loci is more than 3. The critical
number will increase for rare alleles, for example, to 6 when the
minor allele frequency is 0.05. Our ﬁndings do not mean that pooling
should not be applied in practice. There are circumstances under
which pooling is more efﬁcient than no pooling, namely, in situations
when only a small number of haplotypes can occur with appreciable
frequency (Barratt et al., 2002) which can be caused by high LD,
or rare alleles, or both. Thus, pooling is potentially useful in studies
which employ dense sets of markers such as in the genome-wide
context.

Table 4 suggests that genotyping error does not have a prominent
effect on our ﬁndings. Ideally, one could incorporate genotyping
error into the modeling and estimation procedure but this is beyond
the scope of the present article. To compare haplotype frequencies
in case—control studies, we must ﬁrst estimate the frequencies
separately for the cases and the controls and so our ﬁndings are
still relevant.

Note that when we say no pooling in this article, we actually
mean that we are not pooling individuals (i.e. pool size is 1). As
commented by Xu et al. (2008), even when the pool size is 1,
the data collected for each individual is typically genotype data
which is a pool of two chromosomes or haplotypes. There will be
information loss due to phase ambiguity. The ARE of haplotype
estimation from individual genotype data without phase information
relative to genotype data with phase information (which is much
more expensive to get; easily 10 times more according to our
colleagues who collect such data) can also be calculated using the
results of this article for the asymptotic variance of the unphased
data MLE and the multinomial variance formula for the phased
data MLE. Assuming again that the minor allele frequencies are
equally spaced between 0.1 and 0.3, the asymptotic efﬁciencies
of the estimator based on unphased data relative to that based on
phased data are 0.874,0.717,--- ,0.101,0.078 for the case of 2—12

independent loci. Unlike in Tables 2 and 3, we have not taken cost
into consideration so far. Suppose it is c times more expensive to
obtain phased data, then the costs of collecting phased data for n1
individuals and unphased data for on] individuals are the same and
the aforementioned asymptotic efﬁciencies should all be multiplied
by c to give a fairer comparison based on the same cost. It follows
that if c = 10, there is no gain in estimation efﬁciency (for the same
cost) to obtain phase information if the number of independent
loci L is less than 12. The effect of LD is to reduce the effective
number of independent loci and this will favor no phasing even
more. This provides theoretical justiﬁcation to the prevailing practice
of not ascertaining phase information using molecular haplotyping
method.

A1 Derivation of the asymptotic variance of the pooled
data MLE of 1012...],

Since $12.44 205115).” L, we can work with the canonical parameters
and the problem reduces to ﬁnding the asymptotic variance of the

MLE of L. For a pool of K individuals, there are n=2K
DNA strands. Let Y1 =(Y11, ..., Y1L), ...,Yn =(Yn1, . . ., YnL) be the
haplotypes of the n strands. Assuming Hardy—Weinberg equilibrium,
Y1, ...,Yn are independent and identically distributed according to
the distribution given by (1). With DNA pooling, we observe only
T=Y1+---+Yn=(T1,...,TL),where7}=Y1j+---+Ynjisthetotal
allele frequency at locus j. The likelihood function based on the
observed data T 2 Y1 + - - - +Yn can be obtained from the probability
function (1) using the multivariate convolution formula and we
can differentiate the resulting log-likelihood function to obtain the
score function. This is very tedious and an easier way to obtain
the score functions based on the observed data T=Y1+---+Yn
is to take conditional expectation of the score functions based on
the unobserved data Y1, . . . , Y”, which is a well-known result in the
EM literature (see, e.g. McLachlan and Krishnan, 1997, p. 100).
It is straightforward to write down the score functions based on
Y1, ...,Yn because the distribution in (1) belongs to an exponential
family. Taking conditional expectations of these exponential family
score functions will give us the score functions based on the
observed data T=Y1+---+Yn. Under linkage equilibrium, the
score functions can be further simpliﬁed to

MLE L of L, as the number of pools np increases, is to

the asymptotic variance of L is n;1 times the reciprocal of

One can readily express the scores S1,...,SL,S12,...,SL_1,L,
$123,...,SL_2,L_1,L,...,512...L as linear combinations of the Z’s
by taking inner products. As a result, we can obtain the Fisher’s
information matrix, which is just the variance—covariance matrix of

the scores, from the variance—covariance matrix of the Z ’s which is
diagonal due to orthogonality. The asymptotic variance—covariance
matrix of the MLE of the canonical parameters is n;1 times the
inverse of the Fisher’s information matrix.

For loci 1 and 2 in block 1, deﬁne T12 = Z Yil Yiz. We can again
i:

obtain the score vector by taking conditional expectation of the

‘complete data’ score vector. Let
T12 =E[T12|T1,T2],
n’f =(T1,T2,T12)T,
PT =(P1,P2,P12)T,

utilizing blockwise orthogonalization techniques, its covariance
matrix is AITlAT. Note that conditional on T1 and T 2, T12 follows
a hypergeometric distribution and

Var(T12)=n*p12*(1—p12)—E[Var(T12|T1,T2)].

As suggested by Liao and Rosen (2001), E [Var(T12|T1 , T2)] can be
accurately evaluated by generating a large random sample of T 1 , T 2
and then averaging Var(T12|T1,T2) across the sample. Denote the
haplotype frequencies by p = {py1 ymy 4 ,yi = 0, 1, 1 5 i 5 4.}. We have

k =py1y2y3y4 (in ...yik —pi1___ik), wherepi1 ik is the probability

of allele 1 at 1001 ij, ..., ljc. Denote ﬁmxls by B. By the delta

method, the asymptotrc var1ance—covar1ance matrrx for the MLE of

p is B(A1-1AT)-1BT.

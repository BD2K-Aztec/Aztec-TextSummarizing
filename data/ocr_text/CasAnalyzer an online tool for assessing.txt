Abstract

Summary: Genome editing with programmable nucleases has been widely adopted in research and
medicine. Next generation sequencing (NGS) platforms are now widely used for measuring the fre-
quencies of mutations induced by CRISPR-CasQ and other programmable nucleases. Here, we pre-
sent an online tool, Cas-Analyzer, a JavaScript—based implementation for NGS data analysis. Be-
cause Cas—Analyzer is completely used at a client-side web browser on-the-fly, there is no need to
upload very large NGS datasets to a server, a time-consuming step in genome editing analysis. Cur-
rently, Cas—Analyzer supports various programmable nucleases, including single nucleases and

paired nucleases.

1 Introduction

Programmable nucleases such as zinc ﬁnger nucleases (ZFNs), tran-
scription-activator-like effector nucleases (TALENs), and RNA-guided
endonucleases (RGENs) derived from CRISPR-Cas9/Cpf1 systems,
which are adaptive immune responses in bacteria and archaea, are widely
used for genome editing in many research ﬁelds including biology, bio-
technology, agriculture, and medical science (Kim and Kim, 2014). The
type II Cas9 nuclease ﬁom Streptococcus pyogenes (SpCas9) was the
ﬁrst CRISPR nuclease used for genome editing (Cho et al., 2013; Cong
et al., 2013; Jinek et al., 2013; Mali et al., 2013); since that time, various
orthogonal Cas9 nucleases such as StCas9 (Cong et al., 2013), NmCas9
(Hou et al., 2013), and SaCas9 (Ran et al., 2015) have been developed.
Recently, putative type V Cpfl nucleases from Acidominococcus and
Lachnospiraceae were reported to mediate efﬁcient genome editing in
human cells (Zetsche et al., 2015; Kim D et al., 2016) and mice (Hur et
al., 2016; Kim Y et al., 2016). Moreover, dimeric CRISPR nucleases
such as RNA-guided nickases (Ran et al., 2013; Cho et al., 2014) and
RNA-guided FokI nucleases (Tsai et al., 2014), or biochemical im-
provement of wild-type SpCas9 (Slaymaker et al., 2016; Kleinstiver et

al., 2016) have been developed for genome editing to reduce off-target
effects.

Programmable nucleases introduce DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs)
at user-deﬁned target sites in the genome, ultimately inducing targeted
gene knockout or knock-in via the cell’s own repair systems [error-prone
non-homologous end joining (NHEJ) or homology-directed repair
GTDR) in the presence of a DNA template, respectively]. The induced
mutation rates in cells can be estimated in a straightforward manner by
using Surveyor nuclease (Perez et al., 2008), the T7 endonuclease I
(T7El) assay (Kim et al., 2009), polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis
GJAGE) (Zhu et al., 2014), or droplet digital PCR Nelson et al., 2016).
However, these methods do not allow analysis of mutant sequences and
are limited by relatively poor sensitivity. Recently we and other groups
have used targeted deep sequencing to detect programmable nuclease-
induced mutations with high sensitivity and precision and to analyze
mutation patterns (Baek et al., 2016).

However, analysis of next generation sequencing (NGS) data is difﬁ-
cult for many researchers. Although a few web-based tools such as
CRISPR-GA (Guell et al., 2014), AGEseq 0(ue and Tsai, 2015), and
CRISPResso (Pinello et al., 2016) are available, they are inconvenient to
use because their web interfaces require a very long time to upload large

data ﬁles (Supplementary Note 1). AGEseq and CRISPResso also sup-
port a command-line interface, but they are not accessible to researchers
who are not familiar with bioinformatics. To address this issue, we pre-
sent a web-based tool, Cas-Analyzer, that is constructed with a JavaS-
cript-based algorithm; thus, it wholly runs on the client-side so that large
amounts of sequencing data do not need to be uploaded to the server.
Thanks to the improvements in the newest JavaScript engines in the most
recent web browsers (Supplementary Table 1), this tool works in a rea-
sonable time. Currently, Cas-Analyzer supports a variety of nucleases,
including single nucleases (SpCas9, StCas9, NmCas9, SaCas9, CjCas9,
and Astfl/LbCpfl) and paired nucleases (ZFNs, TALENs, Cas9 nick-
ases, and dCas9-FokI nucleases).

2 Implementation
2.1 File loading

To use Cas-Analyzer, deep sequencing data are needed, which can be
obtained by amplifying the target locus of genome edited cells (Supple-
mentary Note 2) followed by NGS. The format of the raw output data is
usually Fastq or gzip-compressed, and both data types are acceptable to
Cas-Analyzer (Fig. 1A). For the compressed ﬁles, we used a JavaScript
library ‘pako’ (http://nodeca.github.io/pako/), which is slightly modiﬁed
to support blocked gzip ﬁles (BGZF). If users upload paired-end se-
quencing data, Cas-Analyzer ﬁrst merges paired-end reads by the JavaS-
cript port of Fastq-join, a part of ea—utils
(https://code.google.com/archive/p/ea—utilsl).

2.2 Data analysis

Cas-Analyzer analyzes the uploaded data and calculates mutation fre-
quencies in three steps (Fig. 1B-D): i) Cas-Analyzer ﬁrst ﬁnds the cleav-
age point in the reference sequence for the selected nuclease. Using the
given comparison range (R) parameter, Cas-Analyzer deﬁnes 12nt of
indicator sequences on both sides of the given reference sequence and

then selects the valid sequences, which contain both indicators with up to
a l-nt mismatch, from the uploaded data. ii) For the selected sequences,
Cas-Analyzer then counts the recurrent frequency of each sequence and
excludes the sequences below the given minimum frequency (n). iii)
Cas-Analyzer ﬁnally classiﬁes the ﬁltered sequences into three different
groups: ‘insertion’, ‘deletion’, or ‘WT or substitution’ based on compar-
ing the sequence length with the length of the given reference sequence.
Optionally, if a WT marker range (r) is given, the short sequence around
the cleavage point will be used as the marker of wild-type. If this marker
exists in the query sequence, it will always be classiﬁed into the ‘WT or
substitution’ group regardless of its length. Additionally, if the donor
DNA sequence for HDR is given, Cas-Analyzer deﬁnes an HDR indica-
tor (>8nt) by comparing the donor sequence with the reference sequence
and classiﬁes all query sequences that have the HDR indicator into the
‘HDR’ category.

2.3 Sequence alignment

For user convenience, after data analysis is complete, the results (a rela-
tively small amount of data) are aligned to the reference sequence by
using EMBOSS Needle (Rice et al., 2000). The aligned results are cate-
gorized by mutation type and sorted in descending order by count. In
addition, the position and size of insertions or deletions are depicted as
interactive graphs on the results web page (Fig. 1E and F).

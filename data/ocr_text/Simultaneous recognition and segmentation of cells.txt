ABSTRACT

Motivation: Automatic recognition of cell identities is critical for
quantitative measurement, targeting and manipulation of cells of
model animals at single-cell resolution. It has been shown to be
a powerful tool for studying gene expression and regulation, cell
lineages and cell fates. Existing methods first segment cells, before
applying a recognition algorithm in the second step. As a result, the
segmentation errors in the first step directly affect and complicate
the subsequent cell recognition step. Moreover, in new experimental
settings, some of the image features that have been previously
relied upon to recognize cells may not be easy to reproduce, due to
limitations on the number of color channels available for fluorescent
imaging or to the cost of building transgenic animals. An approach
that is more accurate and relies on only a single signal channel is
clearly desirable.

Results: We have developed a new method, called simultaneous
recognition and segmentation (SRS) of cells, and applied it to 3D
image stacks of the model organism Caenorhabditis elegans. Given
a 3D image stack of the animal and a 3D atlas of target cells,
SRS is effectively an atlas-guided voxel classification process: cell
recognition is realized by smoothly deforming the atlas to best fit the
image, where the segmentation is obtained naturally via classification
of all image voxels. The method achieved a 97.7% overall recognition
accuracy in recognizing a key class of marker cells, the body
wall muscle (BWM) cells, on a dataset of 175 C.elegans image
stacks containing 14118 manually curated BWM cells providing the
‘ground-truth’ for accuracy. This result was achieved without any
additional fiducial image features. SRS also automatically identified
14 of the image stacks as involving i900 rotations. With these
stacks excluded from the dataset, the recognition accuracy rose to
99.1%. We also show SRS is generally applicable to other cell types,
e.g. intestinal cells.

1 INTRODUCTION

One of the promises of bioimage informatics is to quantitatively
measure and accurately target single cells, thus facilitating improved
throughput for genetic and phenotypic assays (Peng et al., 2008).
A number of 3D cell and gene expression image segmentation,
recognition and tracking techniques have been developed and
applied to widely used model animals, including Caenorhabditis
elegans (Bao et al., 2006; Jaensch et al., 2010; Long et al., 2008,
2009), fruit ﬂy (Fowlkes et al., 2008; Luengo Hendriks et al.,
2006; Zhou and Peng, 2007) and zebraﬁsh (Keller et al., 2008).
Caenorhabditis elegans is well known for its invariant lineage
and the unique identities of its cells. Single—cell image recognition
and tracking techniques for this animal have led to a deeper
understanding of the genetic signatures of cells, and the relationship
between cell lineage and cell types (Bao et al., 2006; Liu et al.,
2009; Murray et al., 2008). This article focuses on a new method
for recognizing and segmenting C.elegans cells that is more reliable
and applicable to more sample protocols.

Existing image analysis pipelines for single—cell resolution studies
typically start with a segmentation of the cells in a 3D image,
followed by an ad hoc recognition or tracking process. It is typically
hard to ensure an error—free segmentation of cells in an image sample,
especially when (i) the image has an uneven background or low
signal to noise ratio, or (ii) nuclei are so crowded as to touch each or
have irregular morphology. Our experience (Long et al., 2009) is that
segmentation errors promote errors in the subsequent recognition
task in a non—additive fashion. In addition, within this previous
framework, useful prior information, such as the relative location
relationship of cells, and useful statistics from the recognition phase,
such as discrepancies between the predicted and a priori cells
locations, are hard to incorporate in a way that improves the overall
analysis.

In addition, for a variety of experimental settings, it may be
difﬁcult to generate some of the currently used ﬁducial image
features that are critical for accurately recognizing cells. For
example, in the L1 larval stage of C.elegans, there are 81
body wall muscle (BWM) cells. These cells form four nearly
symmetrical bundles, each of which has 20 or so cells in one of
the ventral—left, ventral—right, dorsal—left and dorsal—right quadrants.
Recognizing these BWM cells is critical because they can serve as
additional ﬁducial points for recognizing other cells in the animal.
In experiments using ﬁxed animals (e.g. Long et al., 2009) that
also stain all nuclei, one can recognize these four bundles based on
the asymmetry of the distribution of other cells (e. g. the 15 ventral

motoneurons forms an almost linear array along the ventral side of
the animal). Nonetheless, for live animal experiments, due to the cost
of building transgenic animals and the limited number of ﬂuorescent
color channels, it is desirable to be able to recognize these BWM
cells or other cells (e. g. intestinal cells and neurons) directly without
additional ﬁducial patterns.

In this article, we propose a new approach to recognize and
segment cells in C. elegans. We essentially eliminate the need for
a two—step, segment—then—recognize process. Instead, our method
recognizes cells directly, producing the segmentation as a by—
product. We realize this idea as an atlas—guided voxel classiﬁcation
algorithm, which integrates the processes of atlas—to—image mapping
and voxel classiﬁcation under a robust deterministic annealing
framework. We have experimentally tested the performance of the
new approach on datasets of BWM cells and a number of other
cell types. Our approach generalizes well in producing reasonable
automatic recognition accuracy for 14 118 manually curated cells.

2 ATLAS-TO-IMAGE MATCHING

The input of our algorithm consists of a 3D image stack where
the target cells have been stained in a single color channel, and a
3D atlas (which is a 3D point cloud representing the stereotyped
spatial locations) of the target cells. The goal of the algorithm is
to automatically extract the ‘meaningful’ objects in the image and
assign one of the cells in the atlas to each of these objects. The atlas
is produced in our previous study (Long et al., 2009).

Mathematically, suppose we have an image that consists of N
voxels V={v,-,i=1,2,...,N} and an atlas of K cells C0={CJQ,
j=1,2,...,K}, where v,- is the i—th voxel and c? is the j—th cell,
respectively. The goals of our algorithm are (i) to classify (i.e. label)
the voxels X into K groups, each of which corresponds to a unique
cell, and at the same time (ii) to smoothly map each atlas cell C19 to
a new 3D spatial location in the image that can best represents the
corresponding voxel subset.

One intuitive and conventionally used method is to ﬁrst segment
all image objects, and then use certain matching methods, such as the
bipartite graph matching or the constrained graph matching to assign
the identities (Long et al., 2008). One drawback of this method is that
the over— or under—segmentation of cells will affect the recognition.

We consider a direct atlas—to—image matching approach, to attain
both recognition and segmentation of cells at the same time. Since
the atlas encodes all target cells’ identities and their spatial location
relationship, our method recognizes cells via smoothly deforming
the atlas to ﬁt the image. This process effectively classiﬁes, or
labels, voxels in the image; each group of voxels with the same
label represents the extraction of a ‘meaningful’ object and thus
the image is also segmented. From a segmentation perspective, the
key difference between our new approach and previous ones is that
now we can naturally incorporate the relative location relationship
of cells that is encoded in the cell atlas when we segment cells,
thus reducing the chance of wrong segmentation. More importantly,
with the new approach we could directly predict cell identities,
without the complication due to problematic segmentation. We call
this new atlas— guided voxel classiﬁcation approach the simultaneous
recognition and segmentation (SRS) of cells.

Our approach can be viewed as a substantial extension of
a point—set matching method based on deterministic annealing

(Chui and Rangarajan, 2000). Our SRS method not only extends
the deterministic annealing approach to the 3D image domain
(Sections 3.1 and 3.2), but also proposes a systematic way
to incorporate the domain prior information of cells’ spatial
distribution to solve real cell annotation and segmentation problems
(Section 3.3).

3 SRS ALGORITHM

There are two aspects in the SRS algorithm, namely (i) given an
atlas of cells, how to label/classify voxels, (ii) how to geometrically
transform the 3D atlas of cells. We formulate the following
mathematical model to address both of them.

3.1 Iterative voxel classiﬁcation

Let us ﬁrst assume the availability of a spatial geometric transform
f (.) (Section 3.2), the deformed atlas can be written as C: {cj , j =
1,2, ...,K}, where each Cj = f (uj, C0) and uj is an auxiliary variable
[Equation (3)]. The task is to assign a cell label to each voxel
so that each subgroup of voxels sharing the same label can well
represent the respective cell, and thus overall the image best ﬁts the
deformed atlas.

We consider P 2 [ply], where p,:,- E [0, 1], which is the classiﬁcation
probability of the i—th voxel to the j—th cell. Apparently for any
i6 [1,N], Ejplj = 1. We formulate the following ‘cost’ function:

K N IIVi—lel2
E(P)=ZZpl-jw(vi)7 —T-H(P> (1)

j=1i=1

where ‘11(1),) 2255 —I(v,-) is the inversed image voxel intensity that
is used to penalize the assignment on the low intensity voxels
(assume we have 8—bit images where the maximal intensity is 255),
Q equals the maximum of the three dimensions of the image and
is used to normalize the distance of a voxel and a mapped cell,
H (P) = —EiEJ-pljlog(plj) is the aggregated entropy function of the
classiﬁcation matrix P, and T20 is a varying temperature factor
(see discussion below).

Equation (1) consists of two competing terms. Minimizing
Equation (1) is equivalent to minimizing the ﬁrst term while
maximizing the second term. Minimizing the ﬁrst term means
for bright voxels assigning large classiﬁcation probability to their
closest cells. As a result, the classiﬁcation probability matrix should
be far away from uniform distribution. Maximizing the second term
means the voxel classiﬁcation probability should distribute as evenly
as possible. How to ﬁnd a good balance of these two terms?

We consider the time—varying temperature, T, as a way to
smoothly tune the balance of the two terms in Equation (1) during the
optimization. We choose the initial value of T to be a large positive
number. Indeed, when E (P) is a local optimum, for any i, j values
we will have

‘I’(Vi) Vi—C' 2 Q2
_ H lel/ _1

aplj l]

 

(2)

= exp

Therefore, if we use Equation (2) as the formula to iteratively
update pg (of course pi]- will then be normalized in every iteration,
so that for any i6 [1,N], Ejplj = 1), a large T value means that pi]-
will be almost uniformly distributed, thus H (P) has a value close to
its maximum.

Simultaneous cell recognition and segmentation

 

On the other hand, at the end of the optimization, the cell locations
in the atlas should optimally represent all image voxels. This can
be implemented by choosing T=0. We eliminate the inﬂuence of
the second term by gradually decreasing T to 0 over iterations:
T=20 X 0.95”, where n :0, 1,2, ..., is the iteration number.

During the iterative optimization, we also update the location of
each cell of 0' = 1, ...,K) by using the spatial transform f (.) on the
weighted center of the mass of all voxels,

N
c?eW=f(uj,C0) where uj=Zi=1plei. (3)

Of note, we do not need to segment all cells explicitly during
iterations. However, whenever an explicit segmentation of all cells
is needed, we can determine the best cell that contain a voxel v,- by
computing argmaxJ- pij. The segmentation mask of a cell 6]- consists
of all voxels that are optimally contained in Cj.

In 3D microscopic images, the total number of voxels, N, can
easily exceed tens or hundreds of millions. However, the real image
objects (e.g. cells) typically only occupy a small portion of the image
volume in the ‘foreground’ area. There is also a strong correlation
of intensity of the spatial nearby voxels. Therefore, to speed—up
the iterative voxel classiﬁcation, we ﬁrst down—sample an image
by a factor (typically 4) for each of the X, Y and Z dimensions
to reduce the number of voxels. We use the ‘averaging’ ﬁlter in
down—sampling, thus the image voxel intensity used is smoother
than the original image; as a result, the voxel classiﬁcation is more
robust to noise. In addition, we use a conservative threshold, which
is the mean intensity of the image plus one or two times of the
standard deviation of the all image voxels’ intensity, to deﬁne the
‘foreground’ of an image. We run SRS only on the foreground area to
produce the result more swiftly. We produce the ﬁnal classiﬁcation
or segmentation results by up—sampling the intermediate result on
the down—sampled image to have the same dimensions of the original
input image.

3.2 Spatial transform

Why we need a specially designed spatial transform f (.)? The reason
is that if we do not use it, which means that cjnew =uj, i.e. there is
no constraint of the cell deformation, cells may switch their relative
locations in the 3D space. This spatial distortion is meaningless, as
most cells’ relative locations are preserved from animal to animal
(Long et al., 2009).

To preserve the relative locations of cells encoded in the initial
atlas C0, one may use a simple 3D afﬁne transform, which can
translate, scale, shear and rotate the atlas. It is well known that an
afﬁne transform preserves the collinearity of points, and also the
ratios of the distances of distinct points on a line. However, using
the afﬁne transform corresponds to dropping uj from Equation (3).
One obvious caveat is that when the cell locations in the image data
of an actual animal sample differ from the ‘standard’ locations in
the atlas, the afﬁne transform cannot map all cells’ locations in the
atlas exactly to those in the actual image.

To allow local deformation but also preserve cells’ relative
locations and global smoothness, we consider the smoothing—
thin—plate—spline (STPS) (Wahba, 1990) transform. STPS can be
decomposed into an afﬁne transform and a weight—factor controlled
non—linear non—afﬁne warping component.

Given two corresponding point sets {69, j = 1, 2, ...,K} and {iii , j =
1,2, . . . ,K} that represent the 3D locations of cells in the initial atlas

and the locations of subgroups of voxels in each iteration [as in
Equation (3)], a STPS transform f (uj, Co) has the following form,

f(uj,C0)=f(uj,{c(1’,c(2’, ...,c%})

_ 0 K ._0
_AXCj+Zk=1wk'¢(IIMJ ck II)

where A is an afﬁne transform matrix, wk is the non—afﬁne
deformation coefﬁcient, ¢(r)=rzlog(r) is the STPS kernel
function. Denote W=[...,wk,...]T, U and Y as the concatenated
version of points’ coordinates iii and the initial coordinate CJQ, we
compute the least square solution for STPS parameters A and W
using QR factorization (Wahba, 1990):

(4)

U=QR=[Q1 Q2] 

W=Qz<Q§ <I>Q2+ur1Q§ Y (5)

A=R1_1Q1T(Y—<I>W)

where Q, R, Q1, Q2 and R1 are the QR factorization matrices
(and submatrices) of U, CD is a K ><K matrix, where its (i, j)—th
element equals ¢(| lo? — C19] |), and A. > 0 is a weight that balances the
afﬁne portion and non—afﬁne portion of STPS. When A. >> 1, elements
in W will be close to 0, thus the afﬁne part dominates Equation (4).

Since we use iterative optimization to evolve the cell atlas,
for every iteration, once we have obtained the matrix U using
Equation (3), we then calculate W and A using Equation (5),
followed by producing a smoothly deformed new cell atlas using
Equation (4).

Of note, we can also tune the value of A. so that the spatial
transform f (.) exhibits different levels of the deformation. This
helps ﬁt the image best to the deformed atlas, while keeping the
global smoothness and cells’ relative location relationship. We
implement this by setting 2:5000 and over iterations gradually
decreasing the value as A. =5000 X 0.95”, where n :0, 1,2, ..., is the
iteration number.

3.3 Using cells distribution in the atlas

The atlas—to—image matching method discussed in Sections 3.1 and
3.2 has not considered the intrinsic spatial distribution of cells in
an atlas. A biological model system typically has different levels of
invariant features along its ‘major’ axes. For C. elegans, the greatest
degree of freedom of cell locations is along the animal’s anterior—
posterior (AP) axis; there is a general symmetry of cell distribution
along left—right (LR) axis, but along the dorsal—ventral (DV) axis
there is also an obvious asymmetry if all cells are considered.
However, the variation of cell location along DV— or LR—axes is far
less than that along the AP axis. When the BWM cells are considered,
typically they form four almost symmetrical bundles in both LR and
DV directions, except at the tail region of the animal.

Hence, we added an anisotropic weight function D(.) in the cost
function in Equation (1) to give a weaker penalty to the variation
along the AP axis than those along the DV— and LR—axes:

K N —> —> IIVi—Cj“2

E(P)=ZZpiJ-‘I1(vi)D(9(viCj,AP),y)? —T-H(P)
j=1 i=1

(6)
where 6(.) is the angle between the vector from v,- to Cj and
the AP axis of the animal. The weight function D(6, y) has the

cells in the atlas are connected by lines with different colors. The ﬁrst row shows the original image overlaid with the initial atlas; other rows show results
of several intermediate steps of the iterative optimization, with which the atlas of cells (BWM cells shown here) deform to the optimal locations and the
foreground image voxels are automatically classiﬁed to (and thus segmented) each of these cells. The energy values shown are normalized using the total
number of image foreground voxels. When we produced this ﬁgure, the image intensity was enhanced for better visibility. The surface rendering of the

segmented regions can be seen in Figure 5.

where y 2 1 is the coefﬁcient of a raised cosine function that controls
the degree of cells’ movement along the AP direction (we set
y=3), and Agni is a threshold (typically Agni :20) that is related
to )t in Equation (5). When A>Aa”i, cells in the atlas span as
broadly as possibly across the image pattern; when Afkani, the
anisotropic deformation is enabled and thus cells move primarily
along the AP axis.

When only a subset of cells (e.g. BWM cells) is considered,
the symmetry of these cells may make it hard to recognize them.
For instance, during the atlas—to—image matching, an entire bundle
of BWM cells may switch their locations with another bundle,
thus both bundles would be wrongly recognized in this case.
To prevent this ‘mirroring’ error, we considered the afﬁne transform
A in Equation (5). In 3D, A is a 4 X4 matrix, of which the top—
left 3 X3 submatrix, denoted as L, can be used to prevent the
wrong ‘mirroring’ (i.e. reﬂection transform) when we constrain its
determinant to be greater than 0. Of note, this suppression of the
reﬂection transform does not only prevent inter—bundle mirroring
error, but also allow 180O rotation that indeed consists of two
consecutive reﬂection transforms.

Fig. 2. Robustness of the SRS algorithm. For YZ plane and XY plane, the maximum intensity projections are shown. For each subﬁgure, the deformed atlas
(red spheres) was also overlaid on the respective volumetric image for better visualization. For ( b— d), the image intensity was also enhanced for more visible
display only. For (a— d), all SRS results were produced using the original intensity—unenhanced images.

In our implementation to both prevent mirroring and
allow 180° rotation, we compute the standard singular value
decomposition (SVD) of L and obtain its three singular—values, d1,
d2 and d3. If a reﬂection, i.e. det(L) <0, is detected, we replace d3
with —d3, re—compute L using the new d3 value (and also with other
‘old’ components obtained in the SVD), and then use the new L
matrix to replace the top—left 3 X 3 submatrix in A.

Theoretically, the only remaining difﬁculty in recognizing
symmetrical subsets of cells is when they are not only symmetrical in
both DV and LR directions, but also have identical locations (along
AP axis) in adjacent bundles of cells that are 90° apart. We should
note that this case is indeed very rare biologically; for example,
C.elegans BWM cells do not really have this ‘90° similarity’.
However, due to imperfect staining or partial image data (e. g. the
unsimilar region is not imaged or is contaminated by noise), it may
still be observable in real data.

We detect the potential :l:90° rotation around the AP axis
(which corresponds to the x—axis in our C.elegans image data)
in atlas—to—image matching using the following method. We note
that using SVD the afﬁne transform matrix A can be written

as A=R1(R2_1DR2), where R1, R2 are rotation matrixes and D is
the singular value matrix. The matrix R1 controls the ‘ﬁnal’ rotation
of the atlas, and indeed it can also be viewed as a sequential rotation
around the x—, y— and z—axes. The rotation angle around x—axis is
Ot=arctan(R1(2,3)/R1(3,3)), where R1(i,j) is the element at the
i—th row and the j—th column of R1. Whenever |oz| is >45°, there
is a potentially erroneous :l:90° rotation. Finally, once an image is
detected to have a :l:90° rotation around the AP axis, we can always
pre—rotate either the atlas or the image 90° around the AP axis and
then use SRS again to make a prediction, as SRS is able to correct
the 180° mismatch between the atlas and the image (as explained in
the middle of this section).

4 EXPERIMENTAL RESULTS

4.1 Data and parameters

We tested the SRS algorithm using 3D confocal image stacks of the
Ll—stage of C.elegans (Liu et al., 2009). In all the images, 81 BWM
and 1 depressor muscle cell (DEP) are labeled using myo3::GFP.

3 1.051e—05 6.192e—06
4 1.058e—05 6.421e—06

 

We straightened all these images (Peng et al., 2008) before applying
the SRS method to them.

For all experiments in this article, we stop the iterative
optimization when A. becomes to be less than MW [in Equation (7)]
and the sum of the location change of all cells between two
consecutive iterations is <0.1 voxel. Typically SRS converges
within about 200 iterations.

4.2 Visual inspection of the SRS process

Figure 1 and the supplement movie illustrate the process of SRS for
a hard example where the initial atlas has a 180° rotation with to the
subject image. The initial locations of cells in the atlas obviously
mismatch the image objects along AP—, DV— and LR—axes.

Over a series of iterations, image voxels are assigned to the
cells gradually until convergence of the cost function, that decrease
from 144 to 9.9. Initially, e.g. iteration 3, the segmentation is very
inaccurate. However, at this stage due to the high temperature in
Equation (1), the aggregated entropy function term plays the major
role. This indeed helps the atlas rotate 180° to ﬁt to the image. Then
when the temperature is cooled (iterations 10—20) and A. > MW, the
afﬁne transform plays a major role in deforming the atlas. When
the temperature gets even lower (iterations 20 onward), the local
adjustment of voxel assignments becomes the major factor to further
decrease the deformation of the atlas and best ﬁt the cells in the atlas
to the centers of their respective image objects. A group of voxels
that correspond to the optimal ﬁt of an atlas cell form a natural
segmentation mask of this cell in the image.

4.3 Robustness of SRS

We randomly selected four images (ﬁrst row of Fig. 2a and second
rows of Fig. 2b—d) that have different levels of variations in their
scales, rotations, noise levels and cell distributions. For instance, the
cell distribution in the tail region indicates that the worm in (Fig. 2c)
has a different orientation from those in Figure 2a—d.

The SRS algorithm is able to robustly deform the same initial
atlas to all of four images and correctly recognize all BWM and
DEP cells (last rows of Fig. 2 subﬁgures). These 3D images and
their deformed atlases, as well as the full—resolution movies of the
optimization process can be found in our online supplement.

4.4 Consistency of SRS

We started from different initial atlas orientations and investigated
the consistency of the results produced by the SRS method. For
each of the four images in Figure 2, we rotated the cell atlas around
its AP axis every 45° in the range of [0, 360) degrees to produce
eight different initializations, each of which was then deformed to
the respective image. For each group of eight deformed atlases,
we calculated the average and maximum root mean square error

(RMSE) of their corresponding cell positions, as an indication of
the consistency of these results.

Table 1 shows that all the RMSE scores are much smaller than
one pixel, even for the cases where the initial atlas had an orientation
that was 180° from the ‘true’ orientation. This demonstrates that the
SRS algorithm is able to effectively adjust the cells’ location for
these image examples. Both the test images and the rotated atlases
are available in the online supplements.

4.5 Accuracy of SRS

We used a large dataset of 175 image stacks to evaluate the
recognition accuracy of SRS. In this dataset, there are a total of
14118 BWM and DEP cells that were carefully annotated by an
expert of C.elegans anatomy and thus were used as the ‘ ground—truth’
identities of cells in our study.

Because the ground—truth location of a cell determined by
the expert could deviate from the one that is automatically

predicted by SRS, we deem a cell to be ‘correctly’ recognized if
(i) the SRS prediction of a cell is the spatially nearest match of this
cell’s ground—truth location, compared with all other cells’ ground—
truth locations, and (ii) the Euclidean distance between the SRS
prediction and the respective ground—truth location is not larger than

8 voxels, which approximately equal the radius of a typical cell
along AP axis.

For the 175 stacks, SRS automatically identiﬁed 14 stacks
involving :l:90° rotations that may contain less optimal cell
prediction. In the remaining 161 stacks, there are 12976 cells.

SRS correctly predicted the identities of 12 863 cells (99.13%
recognition rate). When we forced SRS to predict all stacks
(including the 14 less optimal ones), the overall recognition rate
is 97.7%. These results indicate SRS is highly effective.

A closer look at the recognition accuracy for each of the 82 BWM
and DEP cells (Fig. 3) shows that most cells can be recognized with
accuracy better than 97%, except the cell BWMDL23 in the dorsal—
left side of the worm. We checked the original images where this
happened and found that indeed this was due to an additional and
nearby Sphincter muscle (SPH) cell that is not in our atlas, but also
has weak expression in some of the original images, inﬂuencing the
recognition.

4.6 Recognition of other cells

To illustrate the general usability of our method, we also applied it to
other cell types. Figure 4 demonstrates that for a stack of intestinal
cells where there are 20 nuclei (labeled using C26B9.5::wCherry
using a similar protocol of the BWM cell labeling), SRS is able to
predict the identities of all nuclei, while at the same time segment
all of them, even some of the nuclei are relatively dark.

4.7 Comparison with other methods

We also compared SRS with previous segmentation and recognition
methods. The watershed algorithm is one of most popular methods
used in 2D or 3D cell segmentation. We compared with the shape—
based watershed algorithm, which is typically thought to be a
well—performing method when the image intensity is uneven (such
as our test images). To produce the best possible watershed result,
we tried multiple different thresholds to deﬁne image foreground
and multiple Gaussian smoothing kernels to remove image noise.
Note that for SRS, we did not do these preprocessing. However,
Figure 5 shows that compared with SRS, in the best case the
watershed result still has substantial over—segmentation and under—
segmentation. Of note, previous studies (e.g. Long et al., 2009)
may use additional methods to split or merge cells after the initial
watershed segmentation. SRS avoids these extra steps.

In Section 2, we discussed that SRS could be thought as
an extension of a deterministic annealing point—cloud matching.
Obviously, such a point—cloud method cannot be directly applied
to the image domain. Therefore, we compared the previous
deterministic annealing method [using the software in Chui and
Rangarajan (2000)] by setting its input to be the expert—curated
segmentation that does not have any segmentation error. For the
test image in Figure 1, we found that deterministic annealing will
produce 180° rotated results and thus 78 of the 82 stained cells
were wrongly recognized. For the 175 images in our dataset, the
average recognition rate of deterministic annealing (with manually
produced ‘perfect’ segmentation) was 49.03% for all 14 118 stained
cells. The main reason is that nearly half of images in our dataset

are 180° rotated compared with the atlas. Chui’s method cannot deal
with this kind of big rotation, even with the ‘ideally’ segmented point
clouds. Thus, SRS is more suitable for the application in this article.

5 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

In this article, we present a highly effective method to
simultaneously recognize and segment 3D cellular images. We also
successfully applied it to automatically annotate C.elegans BWMs
and intestinal cells. We are currently testing this method for other
cell types in C.elegans. This method has potential to be applied
to other model systems, such as fruit ﬂy. It may also be used as
an automatic 3D image registration method to recognize spatially
distinctive feature points: for example, we plan to use it to enhance
our 3D BrainAligner program (Peng et al., 2011).

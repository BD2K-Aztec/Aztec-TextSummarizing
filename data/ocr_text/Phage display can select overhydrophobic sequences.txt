ABSTRACT

Motivation: The phage display peptide selection approach is
widely used for defining binding specificities of globular domains.
PDZ domains recognize partner proteins via C-terminal motifs and
are often used as a model for interaction predictions. Here, we
investigated to which extent phage display data that were recently
published for 54 human PDZ domains can be applied to the
prediction of human PDZ—peptide interactions.

Results: Promising predictions were obtained for one-third of the 54
PDZ domains. For the other two-thirds, we detected in the phage
display peptides an important bias for hydrophobic amino acids
that seemed to impair correct predictions. Therefore, phage display-
selected peptides may be over-hydrophobic and of high affinity, while
natural interaction motifs are rather hydrophilic and mostly combine
low affinity with high specificity. We suggest that potential amino
acid composition bias should systematically be investigated when
applying phage display data to the prediction of specific natural
domain—linear motif interactions.

1 INTRODUCTION

Many protein complexes that function in cellular regulation and
signalling are assembled by multiple linear motif—globular domain
interactions, which are mostly speciﬁc, yet of low afﬁnity (Diella
et al., 2008). One well studied example of such interactions consists
of the PDZ domains, which mainly recognize linear motifs at the
extreme C—terminus of partner proteins (Doyle et al., 1996). PDZs
are implicated in the regulation of cell polarity, tight junctions,
intercellular communication and neuronal synapses (Nourry et al.,
2003). The last residue (referred to as position p0) in PDZ—binding
motifs usually is Val or Leu. The third last peptide residue (position
p—2) can be either Thr or Ser, hydrophobic or Glu or Asp, thereby
deﬁning three main categories of PDZ—binding motifs (Songyang
et al., 1997) (Stricker et al., 1997). These characteristics make
PDZ—binding motifs relatively easy to predict. However, the correct
prediction of PDZ domain binding speciﬁcities, i.e. prediction of
which PDZ—binding motif will bind to which PDZ domain, remains
challenging and numerous approaches have been proposed to tackle
this problem (Brannetti et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2008; Hui and

Bader, 2010; Kalyoncu et al., 2010; Schillinger et al., 2009; Smith
and Kortemme, 2010).

Most predictors rely on prior experimental knowledge about
binding preferences between peptides and globular domains. Phage
peptide display has been widely used to provide such information
(Sidhu et al., 2003). This approach is based on selecting, out
of a library of billions of peptides expressed on the surface of
bacteriophages, a limited number of peptides that bind strongly to
a given protein attached to a solid support. Several phage display
studies have been performed on particular PDZ domains derived
from the proteins MAGIl (Fuh et al., 2000), INADL (Vaccaro et al. ,
2001), PDZRhoGEF and LARG (Smietana et al., 2008), MUPP1
and DLG4 (Sharma et al., 2009), PTP—BL (van den Berk et al.,
2007), Erbin (Skelton et al., 2003), HtrAl and HtrA3 (Runyon
et al., 2007). Tonikian et al. (2008) applied phage display in a high—
throughput manner to determine and compare binding preferences
of 28 Caenorhabditis elegans and 54 Homo sapiens PDZ domains.
The data obtained in this study represent a highly valuable resource
that allows to test the general application of phage display data
to predictions of natural PDZ—protein interactions using position—
speciﬁc scoring matrices (PSSMs). This approach was validated on
a few PDZ domains in the study of Tonikian et al. (2008), and the
phage display data were subsequently used in several recent studies
for predictions of natural PDZ—peptide interactions (Hui and Bader,
2010; Smith and Kortemme, 2010). PDZ phage display data have
also been used as test data in the ‘DREAM4 Peptide Recognition
Domain Speciﬁcity Prediction’ challenge (Smith and Kortemme,
2010). Thus, phage display is supposed to capture accurately the
binding speciﬁcities of domain—linear motif interactions.

Here, we performed and evaluated predictions of human
PDZ—peptide interactions using the phage display data of Tonikian
et al. (2008). Promising predictions were obtained for one—third of
the 54 PDZ domains. In contrast, for the other two—thirds of the PDZ
domains we detected important bias for hydrophobic amino acids
in the phage display peptides that will probably impair the correct
prediction of naturally occurring PDZ—binding peptides. We suggest
that utilization of phage display data for prediction of natural binders
should systematically involve prior analysis of potential sequencial
bias in the data.

Fig. 1. Prediction of natural binders to PDZ domains using phage display data of Tonikian et al. (2008). The last ﬁve residues of phage display (PD) peptides
together with predicted best—matching human C—terminal peptides are shown for six PDZ domains, ordered from the left to the right from most hydrophobic
to most hydrophilic PD peptides. PD lists that were too long for being entirely displayed are indicated by  Asterisks indicate human C—termini that

for which Tonikian et al. (2008) obtained phage peptides. To this
aim, we constructed a PS SM (see Supplementary Material) for each
list of peptides selected by the 54 human PDZ domains. A PSSM
captures the occurrence of each amino acid at each position within
a list of aligned sequences. This allowed us to describe, for each
PDZ domain, a sequence proﬁle deﬁned by the phage peptides
that bound to it. Using each of the 54 PSSMs obtained in that
way, we selected the 25 C-termini of human proteins that matched
best to the sequence proﬁle of the corresponding phage peptide list
(reported in Supplementary Dataset S1). Within these sets of 25
most similar human C-termini, a number of peptides were actually
found to be identical to the corresponding phage peptides (reported
in Supplementary Dataset S2). Several instances of this search are
shown in Figure 1.

Some of the phage peptide lists seemed to be anomalously
enriched in hydrophobic amino acids (such as DVL2-l and
MAGI3-3 in Fig. 1). We used the hydrophobicity index of
Kidera et al. (1985) to compute the average hydrophobicity (see
Supplementary Material) of each list of phage peptides and ranked
these lists from the most hydrophobic to the most hydrophilic
(Fig. 2A). We observed that more identical human C—termini
were returned for the hydrophilic phage peptide lists than for the
hydrophobic ones (Fig. 2B, compare left side and right side of the
plot, P-value <1.0E-6).

Next, we calculated an additional PSSM for each list of 25
human C-termini and determined its distance to the PSSM of
the corresponding phage peptides (see Supplementary Material).
The better the 25 human C-termini match to the sequence
proﬁle of the phage peptides, the more similar (less distant)
the corresponding two PSSMs should be to each other and
the more likely the 25 human C-termini would be to bind the
corresponding PDZ domain. We observed that the more similar
the PS SMs, the more hydrophilic the corresponding phage peptides

PDZ Domains

Fig. 2. Analysis of PDZ—peptide interaction predictions. (A) The 54 PDZ
domains used by Tonikian et al. (2008) were ranked based on the mean
hydrophobicity of their corresponding phage display (PD) peptides, from the
most hydrophobic to the most hydrophilic. This ranking is conserved for plot
B. The vertical dashed line separates hydrophobic from hydrophilic peptide
lists. (B) Numbers of human C—termini that are identical to PD peptides are
plotted for each PDZ domain. (C) PDZ domains (named as in Tonikian et al.)
are listed based on the hydrophobicity of the PD peptide lists with numbers
that were used in diagram A and B. Names in bold indicate PDZs that are
shown in Figure 1.

(Pearson correlation coefﬁcient of —0.51, P-value=7.5E-5, see
Supplementary Figure S1). This analysis indicates that the 25
best-matching human C-termini seem to better reproduce the
sequence proﬁle of the corresponding phage peptides when they
are hydrophilic (see instances in Fig. l).

2.2 Analysing the amino acid composition of phage
display peptides
The above-mentioned analysis has also revealed that about two-

thirds of the human PDZ domains used in the study of Tonikian
et al. (2008) preferentially selected peptides of rather hydrophobic

character (Fig. 2A). We compared the mean hydrophobicity of the
phage peptides to that of different peptide sets (Table 1, column 2):
the C—terminome (all C—termini from the human proteome,
assumed to reﬂect the general hydrophobicity of human C—terminal
sequences, see Supplementary Material); the PDZbase [containing
experimentally validated PDZ—binding peptides originating from
various proteomes (Beuming et al., 2005)]; and the mouse PDZ—
binding peptides published by Chen et al. (2008). All three
sets, which represent naturally occurring sequences, display a
hydrophilic character in contrast to the phage peptides, which are
in average markedly hydrophobic. In particular, the natural PDZ—
binding peptides (derived both from Chen et al. and PDZbase) are
signiﬁcantly more hydrophilic than the phage peptides (2—sample
t—test, P—value = 5E—49).

We further analysed this discrepancy by calculating the frequency
of occurrence of each of the 20 amino acids in the phage peptides,
the PDZ—binding peptides from the PDZbase and the human C—
terminome. The phage sequences are strongly enriched in the
aromatic amino acids W and F (Fig. 3). We also computed the amino
acid frequencies in these three datasets for each of the ﬁve peptide
positions separately (Supplementary Figure S2). All positions show
an enrichment in hydrophobic amino acids, in particular aromatic
residues, for phage peptides. This trend could not be observed for
natural PDZ—binding peptides from the PDZbase or in general human
C—terminal sequences. For instance, position p—l is occupied by W
in almost 50% of the phage peptides versus only 2% of the human
C—terminal peptides, and 6% of the PDZ—binding peptides of the
PDZbase (Table 1, column 3, Fisher’s exact test P—value <2.2E—
16). Interestingly, positions p—l and p—3 and to a lesser extent p—4
seem even to be under—represented for polar or charged residues
in phage peptides in contrast to the two other sets (Supplementary
Fig. S2).

These results indicate that the hydrophobic character of phage
PDZ—binding peptides does not correspond to sequence properties
observed in natural PDZ—binding peptides and general human C—
terminal sequences. This might explain why our search for best—
matching human C—termini to the sequence proﬁle of phage peptides
seems to perform better for PDZ domains that preferentially select
hydrophilic phage peptides.

interactions using phage display data. We observed that phage

Amino acids

C—terminome and PDZ—binding peptides from the PDZbase. Amino acids

according to the hydrophobicity scale of Kidera et a]. ( 1985). All sequences
were cut to a length of ﬁve residues.

peptide lists of Tonikian et al. (2008) can be classiﬁed on the
basis of their hydrophobic character. Human C—termini matched
better to the sequence proﬁles deﬁned by the phage peptides, when
they were hydrophilic. More speciﬁcally, human C—termini that are
identical to phage peptides could be found more frequently for
hydrophilic phage peptides. In addition, we realised that in average
the phage peptides were much more hydrophobic than published
natural PDZ—binding sequences as well as human C—termini in
general. In particular, the phage display data showed a very strong
preference for the largest aromatic amino acid Trp at peptide position
p— 1. All these results indicate that prediction of interactions between
PDZs and naturally occurring peptides perform better when based
on hydrophilic phage peptides.

It should be noted that short linear interaction motifs (Slims)
have been found to display a particular amino acid composition,
which distinguishes them from both folded and disordered regions
(Fuxreiter et al., 2007). The least conserved positions in Slims are
usually non—hydrophobic, whereas the highest conserved positions
are very often occupied by hydrophobic and charged amino acids.
Indeed, published PDZ ligands generally agree with this trend, since
the canonical PDZ—binding motif pattern consists of a hydrophobic
(usually not aromatic) amino acid at peptide position p0 and Thr/Ser,
hydrophobic (usually not aromatic) or Glu/Asp at position p—2.
The phage display procedure of Tonikian et al. often selected
such characteristics at positions p0 and p—2, but the other less
conserved positions (p—l, p—3 and p—4) were, for two—thirds of the
PDZ domains tested, very frequently hydrophobic, thereby deviating
from sequence characteristics of Slims.

Biological interactions are characterized both by their afﬁnity and
speciﬁcity. Afﬁnity represents absolute interaction strength, whereas
speciﬁcity is a relative property derived from the comparison of
interaction strengths of different interacting partners. For instance,
if a PDZ domain binds with higher (but not necessarily high) afﬁnity
to a few peptides than to all others, it will be speciﬁc. Molecular
dynamic studies (Basdevant et al., 2006) have indicated that
hydrophobic interactions are the most important force contributing

to PDZ—peptide afﬁnity, and Beuming et al. (2009) have suggested
that Trp at p—l contributes strongly to the affnity of C—terminal
peptides to Erbin PDZ domain via hydrophobic effects. In this
regard, the phage display procedure, being mainly afﬁnity driven,
may have selected hydrophobic and especially aromatic amino acids
at the least conserved positions of the PDZ—binding motif. However,
transient interactions are required for PDZ—mediated cell signalling.
In such a context, PDZ—binding hydrophobic sequences might turn
out to be counter—productive due to an excessively high afﬁnity. In
addition, interactions involved in signalling also require speciﬁcity
that might not be conferred by hydrophobic binders. Indeed, by
examining SPOT data from Wiedemann et al. (2004), we observed
that a ‘super—binding peptide’ with Trp at p—1 displaying high afﬁnity
for Erbin PDZ domain seemed to be robust against mutations
at other peptide positions indicating a strong contribution of Trp
to the binding afﬁnity. Hence, the Trp at p—l, and hydrophobic
residues at least conserved positions in general, would probably
allow for more putative interaction partners to a PDZ domain and
would make speciﬁc recognition impossible. In summary, it seems
that the phage display approach has a tendency to select high
afﬁnity binders presenting artiﬁcial sequence features in contrast to
evolution rather selecting for speciﬁc binders in the context of Slims.
We notice that a similar conclusion has independently been drawn
in a recent phage display study by Ernst et al. (2010). While this
property of phage display may be useful for drug design or synthetic
biology, it may limit its application for predicting natural domain—
motif interactions. Recently, a promising approach was proposed to
modify the phage display experimental protocol towards a procedure
that will rather select speciﬁc than high afﬁnity peptides (Hoffmann
et al, 2010).

Our study indicates that PDZ—peptide interaction predictions
based on hydrophobic phage peptides should be considered
carefully, especially with regard to speciﬁc, natural interactions,
whereas predictions of interaction networks based on hydrophilic
phage peptides are promising. We hypothesize that similar
constraints in phage display data might also arise in the context
of other types of domain—linear motif interactions. Given the wide
use of phage display for the determination of binding speciﬁcities
of domain—linear motif interactions, the problems addressed here
might apply to many other studies as well.

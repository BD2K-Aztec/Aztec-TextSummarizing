ABSTRACT

Motivation: The analysis of metabolic processes is becoming
increasingly important to our understanding of complex biological
systems and disease states. Nuclear magnetic resonance
spectroscopy (NMR) is a particularly relevant technology in
this respect, since the NMR signals provide a quantitative measure
of the metabolite concentrations. However, due to the complexity
of the spectra typical of biological samples, the demands of clinical
and high-throughput analysis will only be fully met by a system
capable of reliable, automatic processing of the spectra. An initial
step in this direction has been taken by Targeted Profiling (TP),
employing a set of known and predicted metabolite signatures fitted
against the signal. However, an accurate fitting procedure for 1H
NMR data is complicated by shift uncertainties in the peak systems
caused by measurement imperfections. These uncertainties have
a large impact on the accuracy of identification and quantification
and currently require compensation by very time consuming manual
interactions. Here, we present an approach, termed Extended
Targeted Profiling (ETP), that estimates shift uncertainties based on
a genetic algorithm (GA) combined with a least squares optimization
(LSQO). The estimated shifts are used to correct the known
metabolite signatures leading to significantly improved identification
and quantification. In this way, use of the automated system
significantly reduces the effort normally associated with manual
processing and paves the way for reliable, high-throughput analysis
of complex NMR spectra.

Results: The results indicate that using simultaneous shift
uncertainty correction and least squares fitting significantly improves
the identification and quantification results for 1H NMR data
in comparison to the standard targeted profiling approach and
compares favorably with the results obtained by manual expert
analysis. Preservation of the functional structure of the NMR spectra
makes this approach more realistic than simple binning strategies.

1 INTRODUCTION

The quantitative proﬁling of metabolites and the mathematical
modeling of metabolic networks is set to make a major contribution
to our understanding of complex biological systems, including
the processes underlying development and tissue homeostasis
(Weckwerth, 2003). The most commonly used methods for
metabolite detection are mass spectrometry (MS) and nuclear
magnetic resonance spectroscopy (NMR). While each has its
speciﬁc advantages, the inherently quantitative nature of NMR
makes it most attractive for providing data for the development of
mathematical models. However, the current challenge is to extract
reliably quantitative data from experimental spectra, which are
often complex and subject to background variability. Here, we
focus on the exact extraction of metabolite information from 1H
NMR measurements. The general strategy involves pre—processing
steps such as phase— and baseline correction, smoothing and data
reduction (Chang et al., 2007; Xi and Rocke, 2008), followed by
the identiﬁcation of distinct metabolite signatures in the signal
and the estimation of metabolite concentrations with respect to
the original biological samples. Details of the basic pre—processing
used in this work are provided in (Schleif, 2007; Schleif et al.,
2008). A number of approaches have been reported to help in
the subsequent identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of individual
metabolites from pre—processed data (Becker et al., 2009; Weljie
et al., 2006; Xia et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2006). However, none
of the methods currently available can be applied in the reliable,
automated fashion necessary for the high—throughput processing of
complex biological samples (Mendes, 2006; Moco et al., 2007).
As an initial step toward automatic processing, targeted proﬁling
(TP) (Weljie et al., 2006) employs a set of known and predicted
metabolite signatures (targets) ﬁtted against the signal. However,
an accurate ﬁtting procedure for 1H NMR data is complicated by
small but signiﬁcant shift uncertainties in the peak systems, caused
by even minor variations in parameters such as temperature and pH
(Defernez and Colquhoun, 2003).

These uncertainties have a large impact on the accuracy
of identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation and currently need to be
compensated by very time consuming manual interactions.
Independent correction of the shift followed by ﬁtting of the
corrected target descriptions against the signals is not generally
feasible because of the strong overlaps typical of 1H NMR spectra.

Generic methods for the compensation of peak shifts are typically
based on a speciﬁc or average reference signal taken from the

data (Forshed et al., 2005). If such a reference is available, then
the NMR spectra are locally aligned to it such that the ﬁnal set
of spectra is reasonably aligned and corresponding peaks match.
The used optimization techniques commonly employed include
partial least squares approaches (Vogels et al., 1996), genetic
algorithms (Forshed et al., 2003) and procedures based on the
fourier transformation (Savorani et al., 2010). This type of alignment
problem is relevant not only to NMR but also to other data,
including MS (Pierce et al., 2007; Schleif, 2006). While the proposed
approaches are promising and reasonably fast, they assume the
availability of a reference spectrum to be used as the objective goal.
Sometimes it is merely assumed that a set of common reference
peaks is available so that an alignment function can be estimated
based on these data (Schleif, 2006). However, this is often not
realistic and in the setting considered here we do not assume the
existence of a (global) reference spectrum. Furthermore, even for
the aligned spectra one can not ensure that the peaks are aligned to
their true position, only they are aligned to one another. If the chosen
reference is not an undisturbed signal, then there is no guarantee
that the aligned spectra show correct ppm or mass positions for the
peaks. In the case of metabolic proﬁling, this leaves the problem
of correct identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation of the metabolites in a
spectrum with potential peak shifts. Our approach focuses on this
special problem. The prior mentioned alignment methods can be
used as a potential pre—processing only if the analyzed spectra are
reasonably similar, as it should be the case for replicates. In this
case, it is possible to align the spectra ﬁrst before using the approach,
presented below.

The targets consist of a set of parametrized peak models showing
uncertainties in their positions with respect to a true measurement,
as described in more detail below. A typical NMR signal from a
biological sample containing a variety of targets contains around
100 erroneous shift parameters. Local shift uncertainties need to
be corrected within a given tolerance for all these parameters and
often within the context of overlapping targets. Furthermore, NMR
data show very spiked peaks so that both the correct peak positions
and accurate target height estimates are decisive to the accuracy
of metabolite concentration estimates. This makes a complete
evaluation of all possible solutions unfeasible and the problem is
ill posed.

We present here an approach designed to improve this situation by
semiautomatic analysis of the spectra such that only minor, simple
interaction steps are necessary to allow the processing of large
datasets. We developed an approach estimating shift uncertainties
based on a genetic algorithm (GA) (Goldberg, 1989; Mitchell,
1995) combined with a least squares optimization (LSQO) (Fletcher,
2000). Genetic algorithms are known to be very effective in ﬁnding
local optimal solutions for ill—posed problems and have already
been applied to spectroscopic data (Hastie et al., 2001; Jarvis
and Goodacre, 2005). The estimated shifts are used to correct
the known metabolite signatures, leading to signiﬁcantly improved
identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation results. The shift uncertainties
are generally corrected with sufﬁcient accuracy that little or no
subsequent manual interaction is necessary to generate the ﬁnal
quantiﬁcations. The method has been tested on a range of NMR
spectra obtained from cell culture experiments. We have evaluated
the models obtained in comparison to a standard targeted proﬁling
approach as well as to the defacto standard of a careful manual
analysis. We have also studied the observed shift uncertainties with

respect to their inﬂuence on the concentration estimates during the
multiple steps of the GA.

2 APPROACH AND METHODS

2.1 NMR spectroscopy

All 1H NMR—spectra were acquired on an AVANCE 700MHz NMR
spectrometer (Bruker, Rheinstetten, D) equipped with a 5 mm cryo—probe.
A pulse acquire sequence was used with 512 accumulations, 65 536 complex
points, 8389.2 Hz sweep width corresponding to 11.982 ppm on the chemical
shift axis (0.002 ppm , 0.13 Hz nominal spectral resolution, respectively)
and a repetition time of 20s (> ﬁve times the T1 of the reference and
metabolites) ensuring fully relaxed, quantiﬁable signals. NMR samples
were prepared by resuspending lyophilized cell extracts in 500 ul D20
(99.9 atom %, Sigma Aldrich, Steinheim, D) potassium phosphate buffer
(0.05 M, pH 7.4) containing a known concentration (60—120uM) of
2, 2/dimethylsilapentane—5—sulf0nate (DSS, 99.0%, Fluka, Taufkirchen,
Germany) as a reference for chemical shift and quantiﬁcation. Each extract
was then mixed vigorously by vortexing and centrifuged for 4min at
10.000 g. The supernatants (~ 500 ul) were transferred to 5 mm NMR tubes
(Wilmad, Vineland, NJ USA). All samples were subject to NMR analysis at
298 K within 12h.

2.2 Data pre-processing

We focus on the analysis of 1H liquid NMR spectra obtained from extracts
of cultured stem/progenitor cells, detailed subsequently. Each spectrum
was pre—processed using in—house Matlab (Mathworks Inc, 2008) routines.
Spectra were phased, baseline corrected and referenced using DSS as a
chemical shift and shape indicator (CSI).1 Furthermore, the region around
(4.5—5.9ppm) was set to zero for each spectrum to remove the water
resonance contributions. Further details on the basic pre—processing are given
in Schleif (2007); Schleif et al. (2008).

2.3 Dataset description

We employed a set of six NMR spectra from cells cultured under a range of
conditions to provide biologically realistic degrees of sample complexity and
variation. The expected metabolites in the signal (subsequently referenced
as targets) were as follows: Alanine (Ala), Asparagine (Asn), Aspartate
(Asp), Citric Acid (Cit), Cysteine (Cys), Glutamate (Glu), Glutamine (Gln),
Glycine (Gly), Histidine (His), Iso—Leucine (Ile), Lactate (Lac), Leucine
(Leu), Malate (Mal), Methionine (Meth), Myo—Inositol (Myo), Phenyl—
Alanine (Phe), Proline (Pro), Pyruvate (Pyr), Serine (Ser), Succinate (Succ),
Threonine (Thr), Tryptophan (Trp), Tyrosine (Tyr), Valine (Val), Fumarate
(Fum) and D88 as the standard reference. The signal is also expected to
contain some unspeciﬁed metabolites.

The murine multipotent hematopoietic progenitor cell line FDCPmix
(Factor—Dependent Cells Paterson mixed potential) was grown in IMDM
supplemented with 5 mM D—glucose, 2mM L—glutamine, 1mM sodium
pyruvate, 20% horse serum and 10 u/ml IL—3. Six independent cultures were
analyzed and generated separately over a period of 18 months under the same
culture conditions. The cells were maintained at 37°C in 5% C02 in air at
densities between 6 x 104 and 5 x 105 cells per ml by passaging every 2—3
days. At the ﬁnal passage, the cells were transferred to a fresh medium
and cultured for 3 days. Between 1><108 and 2 x108, cells from each
experiment were harvested by centrifugation and washed four times with
ice cold phosphate—buffered saline (PBS) to remove medium constituents.
The cell pellets were shock frozen in liquid nitrogen and extracts prepared
by addition of 800 ul ice cold methanol:acetonitrilezwater 1 : 1 : 1 mixture. To
ensure efﬁcient cell disruption, the cells were subjected to 2 x 1 min bursts of

 

1Other choices for the CSI e.g. trimethylsilyl propionate (TSP) are also
possible. The ideal CSI is only one peak with no overlap to other peaks.

ultrasound in an ice—cold ultrasonic bath. The samples were then transferred
to a 70°C water bath for 10 min to denature the proteins before being diluted
1 :7 with water and lyophilized.

Additionally, we analyzed a set of four spectra of wet—lab mixtures of the
ﬁve metabolites (Ile, Leu, Glu, Val, Meth) and DSS as a standard with known
concentrations.

2.4 Manual NMR expert analysis

The metabolites of interest were ﬁrst measured individually by NMR
to provide reference spectra. A known concentration of the metabolite
(1—20 mM) together with DSS (0.1—2 mM) was prepared in 50011.1 buffered
D20 solute (see Section 2.1) and measured under the same conditions as
those used for the cell extracts. This allowed the determination of all chemical
shifts (a) and coupling constants (J) of each signal—generating metabolite
proton as a basis for the reliable identiﬁcation of metabolites in subsequent
experiments.

Metabolite identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation was achieved using purpose—
developed NMR software (NMRj, (Schlumm and Riemer, 2001) allowing for
the interactive subtraction of a simulated from a measured NMR—spectrum.
The chemical shifts and coupling constants from the simulation were
carefully adjusted within a range of <0.01 ppm to enable stringent ﬁtting
of the frequency pattern of the individual spin systems to the cell extract
spectrum. The criteria for an acceptable ﬁt were ﬁrstly that all of the simulated
peaks be present in the measured NMR—spectrum (i.e. identiﬁcation of
the metabolite) and secondly that the difference spectrum resulting from
subtraction of the simulation from the measurement exhibited a smooth
baseline at the position of metabolite frequencies. The latter step requires that
the simulated signal is folded by a line broadening function that is as close
as possible to that of the measured spectrum. This was achieved by using
up to three exponential broadening functions, independent in amplitude,
damping and frequency offset, for folding the simulated spectral time signal.
Metabolite concentrations were calculated from the identiﬁed metabolite’s
NMR time signal amplitude relative to the time signal amplitude of the
known DSS reference concentration, taking into account the relative number
of contributing protons.

2.5 NMR and targeted proﬁling

High resolution 1H NMR spectra consist of a large number of relevant
signals. Metabolite signatures are represented in general by multiple narrow
peaks located on top of a wide underlying complex baseline. The NMR
signal s(v) can be approximated as a super composition of Lorentzians
(Koh et al., 2008), Gaussian functions or mixtures thereof. However, such
assumptions are highly idealized. In practical measurements, the line shape
of the peaks is much more complex and inhomogeneous due to measurement
imperfections. This poses multiple challenges in the analysis because almost
all relevant signals in the NMR measurement show strong overlapping
components. Without an appropriate model of the signal structure and line
shape, a deconvolution is extremely complicated. This is especially true for
signal components at low concentrations, which may otherwise be easily
overlooked.

The TP approach (Weljie et al., 2006) analyses metabolites by referencing
to a set of known signatures. Taking some relatively strong assumptions
concerning the line shape and knowledge about the structure of the targets,
TP tries to identify and quantify these target metabolites in the complex NMR
spectrum.

The TP approach assumes an almost perfect knowledge of the peak or line
shape, which is typically modeled as a Lorentzian or a Gaussian function. It
is also assumed, that the number of candidate signatures in the mixture s(v)
is small and restricted to a speciﬁc subset of known metabolites, the targets.
Furthermore, it is assumed that for all targets, their peak sequence, i.e. the
signal signature deﬁned by the position and height of the peaks, is known
perfectly beforehand. In practice, it is often very difﬁcult to provide such a
description analytically for complex mixtures with extensive overlaps. For

this reason, the peak system is constructed (manually) by adding appropriate
peaks at the correct ppm position and height. The targets are subsequently
ﬁtted against the measurement.

TP is being adopted as a standard technique in metabolite analysis and has
already been employed in a number of studies see e. g. (Son et al., 2009; Swire
et al., 2009; Tiziani et al., 2009). While TP has been found to be very effective
in a range of applications, it remains suboptimal in many cases: (i) due to
variations in the measurement conditions (e. g. temperature, pH), the position
of the g,- in a target (groups of peaks) may shift in a non—linear manner. (ii) A
speciﬁc line shape has to be chosen for the ﬁtting of the candidate targets
against the signal. Since the actual line shape may deviate from the chosen
forms, this assumption can lead to further problems especially for strongly
overlapping signals as depicted in Figure 1. (iii) The simple ﬁt of individual
targets against the signal s(v) may fail for strongly overlapping structures,
while the use of lower constraints on the ﬁtting commonly leads to incorrect
identiﬁcations of targets. In the later case, it can happen that lines are ﬁtted
into regions without signal.

The TP approach also lacks the formal and mathematical derivation
and modeling basis which would simplify adaptations, for instance to
accommodate moderate changes in the device settings such as alternative
measurement frequencies or to incorporate alternative peak shape models.

In the following section, we formalize targeted proﬁling and detail our
extension thereof. We provide an appropriate mathematical modeling for the
ﬁtting and parameter estimation approach, taking the functional characteristic
of the measurements into account.

3 EXTENDED TARGETED PROFILING

An arbitrary metabolite may formally be given by a functional
description f (v) for a target signal as f (v)=ZJ-G gJ-(v) with gJ-(v)
as a peak pattern or a function of delta functions with non—zero
entries only on the appropriate peak positions as detailed below and
G as the number of such peak patterns. Using the TP approach,
f (1)) may be folded with an appropriate line shape e. g. a Gaussian.
A reconstruction of alanine using the functional description is given
in Figure 2.

An alternative compact description of a target e. g. alanine is
given by its 1H NMR spin system classiﬁcation as A3X spin system
(see e. g. (Levitt, 2008), with the associated values for the chemical
shifts of 0(HA) = 1.46 ppm, 0(HX) = 3.76 ppm and an A—X coupling
constant of J AX 27.2 Hz see Figure 3.

Using the above spin system classiﬁcation, we can employ a NMR
simulation environment (Smith et al., 1994) to simulate the alanine
spectrum while taking the physical properties of our measurement
system (such as device frequency) into account.

This simulation yields transition tables providing information on
the peak positions and heights of each peak for the target. A transition
table for L—alanine is shown in Table 1.

From this line spectrum, we can generate a proﬁle spectrum,
similar to a true measurement by folding the line spectrum with
an assumed line shape, leading to our functional description f (v) of
a given target (see Fig. 2). Taking this approach, we can model the
phased and baseline corrected signal s(v) as

The table was generated using standard settings for a 700.153 MHz NMR system 1H
channel as speciﬁed before.

We employ a non—negative Least Squares Fit over all J identiﬁed
targets 13(1)) using the functional description and the subsequently
generated peak information. Thereby 0 represents a global shift that
can be compensated by a reference shift correction and 6 represents
noise. The target can be approximated as a super composition of
its component functions or peak groups gi deﬁned by the number
Gj of chemical shifts in the molecule’s spin system.

A small local shift —y 5 A) 5 —l—y typically within a range of |y| 5
0.005 ppm can be expected for each peak group. Each component
®k(v) of gi(v) can be considered as a delta function, contributing to
a line spectrum with non—vanishing amplitude for one peak position
only. We denote such a single position v as ij-JC to specify peak
k caused by group i in metabolite j. K is the multiplicity of a
component function g. The origin of the chemical shift group
components ®k(v) lies in the spin—spin interaction characterized
by the scalar coupling constant J AX and can be deduced from the
quantum mechanical calculations for the spin system parameters
describing the target metabolite. Subsequently, this line spectrum is
folded (X) by a line shape function 50 to mimic the line shape of the
real measurement. In the following, we will use G for Gj and K for

Kj, ,- if the indices are known from the context. In NMR, the position
of the gi is known as chemical shifts. The estimates of these shift
positions need to be as accurate as possible and are the main error
source in the TP approach.

An accurate peak shape estimate is the key to an appropriate
subtraction of signal components from s(v) in order to reveal
potentially hidden components. We approach this issue by taking
the shape of the DSS reference signal added to the sample, as a
template for 50. This shape is used to estimate the expected peak
width present in the signal.

To tackle the shift—uncertainty problem, we estimate values for
the disturbances A shown in Equation (2) and present an initial
solution to optimize the gi positions in potential targets using a grid
search strategy. This approach leads to a general improvement in
position estimates for the true chemical shifts of the subpatterns gi
of potential targets fl- and hence to more accurate identiﬁcation and
quantiﬁcation estimates as shown below.

Whereas standard TP identiﬁes signatures in NMR mixtures by
employing known database references of (manually) speciﬁed peak
patterns, the Extended Targeted Proﬁling approach (ETP) described
here modiﬁes this concept by modeling the targets based on their
theoretical spin system model (see Smith et al., 1994). This model
provides the peak information (transition tables). The physical model
easily deals with measurement variables such as different device
frequencies and is known to provide very accurate peak lists.
The parameters of the targets are optimized with respect to the
measurements at hand. Each target description T (generating a signal
13(1)» is characterized by a set of spin system descriptors Td ES. S
describes the theoretical aspects of the spin system of T and can be
used in combination with a model of the measurement system (NMR
system) to simulate the spectrum for T. A spectrum representation
of T can be divided into multiple parts, one for each spin system
descriptor Td, known as the peak group (g). A peak group may
consist of multiple or single peaks and is potentially overlapping.
For each group, a potential (limited) shifting uncertainty A ,- can be
expected. New targets can be added to the ETP approach very easily
by specifying the spin system model, outlined above, based either
on knowledge available in the literature or by own measurements of
the pure target substance under the previously deﬁned measurement
conditions. In the latter case, the obtained spectrum is analyzed
manually to deﬁne the spin—system model. Hereby an NMR expert
constructs a spin system model such that the reconstructed spectrum,
based on this model, ﬁts best to the observed data. The three steps of
ETP required to obtain an optimized ﬁt based on this new encoding
strategy are detailed below.

3.1 Line representation of a NMR spectrum

NMR spectra can be described by means of a set of overlapping
peaks, which provides a compact representation of the signal and
can also reveal quickly whether or not an expected target is likely
to be present in s(v), since all simulated target peaks must also
be present in the peak list of s(v). The peak picking process is
rather complicated, and a number of heuristic approaches have been
proposed to improve the situation (Brelstaff et al., 2009; Koh et al.,
2008). Here, we focus on a simple parametric hill—climbing approach
(Schleif et al., 2008). We further assume that for each measurement
a known CSI signal is available, in our case this is DSS. This signal
has a known position of 0 ppm, which can be used to compensate the

global shift offset of the spectrum. We look for a maximum within a
window of 0.05 ppm at the expected CSI position. From this position,
we then go down (to lower intensities) on the left and the right ﬂank
of the peak as long as the signal is a descending monotone. The
peak is then truncated at a predeﬁned maximal width. The center
position and the peak width at half maximum (PWHM) are then
calculated for this peak. The PWHM is used as a rough estimate of
the peak width. Due to effects such as imperfect phasing, shimming
or baseline correction, a direct inverse deconvolution of s(v) with
the CSI reference is not generally feasible. Instead, we employ a
hill—climbing algorithm and look above a predeﬁned threshold (the
expected noise level) through the whole signal for local maxima,
whose ﬂanks are sufﬁciently steep and for which the obtained peak
has a sufﬁcient width. By application of this algorithm, we obtain
a list of peaks in a spectrum. This list is subtracted from s(v) and
the algorithm is repeated until no further peaks are detected. This
approach can also resolve peaks in an overlap, although not in
every case. Alternatively, the strategy described in (Koh et al., 2008)
can be used with an underlying Lorentzian support, the particular
peak picking algorithm is not of much relevance here as long as it
discovers the peaks in the spectrum to a sufﬁcient degree of accuracy.
The list of peaks is subsequently denoted as 79. These peak lists are
compared with those of the potential targets. If a sufﬁcient number
of peaks (e.g. 30%) in a target can be matched within a tolerance
of 0.01ppm to the peaks 7?, we consider the target to be identiﬁed
and proceed with the analysis steps for this target. We now have the
target as a functional line spectrum 13(1)) with 50 as the ﬁtted line
function.

3.2 Genetic algorithm for shift-uncertainty estimation

A major feature of our approach is the shift—uncertainty correction
performed by means of a Genetic Algorithm (GA). The genetic
algorithm software was written in—house in Matlab running on an
Intel Xeon multiprocessor system with 8 3.20 GHz processors and
16 GB memory using the parallel processing, signal processing and
optimization toolbox with Matlab 2008b. We made use of the GA
implementation in the optimization toolbox but replaced some of the
core methods with our own purpose—developed implementations.
Speciﬁcally, we replaced the methods used to generate the initial
population and the mutation function and provided a speciﬁc ﬁtness
function as described below. The basic algorithm and parameters
for the GA are shown in Table 2 and the overall workﬂow is
depicted in Figure 4. Brieﬂy, we generate a large number of
chromosomes P, each chromosome has the same length Z =  Gj,
equal to the number of groups over all analyzed targets, and each
of which contains the currently estimated, or randomly determined
shift values for the A). These A,- are optimized by the GA.
Furthermore, the smallest shift is limited by the ppm—axis resolution.
We have found that a reduction of the original spectrum to 16k
points corresponding to 0.5 Hz spectral resolution is possible, while
maintaining structural information of sufﬁcient quality for the
subsequent identiﬁcation task. In this case, up to 25 valid shift
positions are possible for a given shift uncertainty of :l:0.01ppm.2

 

2If we assume a spectral resolution of SR 2 0.5 Hz, a device frequency
of F 2700 MHz and an error of PPM—E: :l:0.01 ppm, the number of valid
positions V is V%2.PPM—E/(SR/F).

3.2.] Fitness function and evaluation measures The ﬁtness
function is the core element of the GA and is evaluated for each
single chromosome separately. It consists of three procedures: (i)
the spin system classiﬁcations of all identiﬁed metabolites are used
to generate the corresponding spectral representation. Thereby, the
shifts given by the chromosome are applied to the corresponding
groups g), and the reconstructions folded with the prior estimated
line shape. We denote the matrix of all reconstructions 1331)), given
as row vectors, as the matrix R

to) row)
(ii) These reconstructions are reduced to a range representation such
that a compact form of R denoted as R’ is obtained. In R’ not all
values for 1) are used but only a limited set of 1) in the form of
potentially overlapping range vectors 1><11=[1)l—(2-PPM—E):1)l—l—

(2-PPM —E)] with l as an index of a peak positions in T.

We collect all peak center positions of the metabolites denoted
as T: {T1 , ...,TJ} with Tj={1)j,,-,k}iGJ:<K and we T. Here, we also

incorporate the A,- and take the peak positions from the transition
tables extended to a range of twice the assumed ppm—uncertainty
PPM—E for each peak. A reduced test spectrum s’ (1><1) is constructed,
accordingly.

(iii) The matrix R’ and the vector s’ (1><1) are subsequently used in
the LSQO, as the third step, to calculate the a,- for all targets. The
reduction to a range—based representation is useful to avoid very
large and extremely sparse matrices, which would complicate the
subsequent a estimations. This step has no detrimental effects on
the a—estimates.

3.3 Non-negative least squares ﬁtting

The targets 13’ (1><1) are now given in the functional description of
(2) with optimized A), using the known @k and our functional
shape estimation for all peak groups. The function to ﬁt is our
reduced spectrum s’ (1><1). We add constraints for non—negative
a,- and allow for user deﬁnition of aj ﬁxed on a target  by
employing standard optimization modeling techniques. Solving the
optimization problem by use of a standard constrained linear least
squares algorithm we obtain the aj in a column vector at, which can
subsequently be used to calculate the concentration estimates. To this
end, the area under the a—scaled target is calculated and associated
to the area of the a—scaled reference signal (here DSS). A scaling
step is then performed, based on the number of protons 1H present
in the reference, nine for DSS, compared with the number of protons

present in the metabolite e. g. four for Ala. This leads to the following
area(Ala)-c(DSS)-9
area(DSS)-4
with area as an appropriate estimation function for the area under the
curve. One can also calculate estimates of the lower concentration

limits by scaling the target intensities of 13’ to the noise level and

equation for the concentration c in mol: c(Ala) =

repeating the procedure. The reconstruction s* is obtained as:
s* =RT ~0t (5)

To judge the ﬁtness of this solution, we may now either use
the quality of ﬁt provided by the LSQO algorithm or evaluate the
reconstructed spectrum s*(1)) with respect to s(1)) using a problem—
speciﬁc distance measure. Here, we use either the standard Euclidean
distance (EUC) or a functional distance measure as an extension
of the LP norm proposed in (Lee and Verleysen, 2005) (FUNC).
The functional distance measure has the advantage of taking the
functional nature of the spectra into account. The standard EUC
considers the individual features of the NMR spectrum to be
independent, so that a change in the order of the ppm positions
does not affect the calculated distance. However, the features or
measurement points in NMR spectra are not independent, so that a
distance taking this aspect into account can be considered to be more
appropriate for this type of data. Lee proposed a distance measure
taking the functional structure into account by involving the previous
and next values of a signal 1),- in the i—th term of the sum, instead
of 1),- alone. Assuming a constant sampling period 1:, the proposed
norm (FUNC) is:

is shown in Figure 5. The calculation of this norm is slightly more
complex than that of the standard Euclidean but, as is shown below,
signiﬁcantly improves the ﬁtting results as well as the convergence
speed of the GA.3

4 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

4.1 Identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation

We have tested our approach using measurements of metabolites
in lysates of cultured cells as well as a small test set with known
concentrations of deﬁned metabolites. Rather than focusing on a
speciﬁc biochemical question, we aim to compare the range and
concentrations of metabolites detected using TP and ETP with those
obtained by manual expert proﬁling.

4.1.] Wet lab metabolite mixture experiment The wet—lab mixture
datasets (M—DS) can be considered to be an artiﬁcial dataset
with known concentrations. In Table 3, the known concentrations
(weighted sample) and the concentration estimates as obtained by
the expert, TP and ETP using the functional distance measure are
given. We observe that the ETP approach is closer to the expert
estimation than is TP. The DSS concentration was given with 77.05
,1). mol for all spectra.

4.1.2 Cell culture experiment Details of the analyzed cell extract
data are shown in Figure 6. The optimized approach provides results,
which are much closer to the expert analysis, for 16 of the 21 targets.
Eth, Cit, His, Myo and Mal were noted as being absent by the expert
but by ETP and TP with very low concentrations.

 

3The additional effort in the calculations is almost negligible—the time to
calculate a generation is changing only minor, by a few seconds.

Figure 7 shows a reconstruction of a signal part with respect to
the original signal to illustrate the effect of the shift correction.

From Table 4 we observe that the EUC measure in the ﬁtness
function is indeed less effective than the FUNC measure, consistent
with our expectation that the FUNC norm is more appropriate
to data which are themselves functions.4 We subsequently restrict
our analysis to the FUNC norm and the standard TP approach. In
Figure 8, we show Box—Whisker Plots of the relative concentration
errors with respect to the expert of the metabolite concentrations
using the standard TP and the ETP (FUNC) approaches. It can be
seen that the relative error of ETP is much smaller than that of TP in
the large majority of the metabolites. Also the variance of the results
is smaller. Median errors of TP versus ETP are shown in Table 5.
Signiﬁcance of an improvement is indicated by a + using a t—test on
a 5% level, with signiﬁcances of P 5 0.03. We observe that ~25%
of the differences are signiﬁcant and all these are positive.

4.2 Shift-uncertainty properties and inﬂuence

The shift—uncertainty estimates A change over time with respect to
the GA evolution and the underlying constraints. The GA can only
determine a local optimal solution, which is expected to correspond
to the global optimum in only a very few cases. An analysis of the
number of updates per shift—uncertainty estimate reveals parameters
which are likely to be incorrect either because they have not been
updated at all or because they have been updated very frequently.
An example for Specl is shown in Figure 9. Taking this statistic into
account, the expert can be assisted by an indicator that highlights
peak group shifts that are likely to be incorrect. Considering the
values of the shift uncertainties for the analyzed spectra, we found
around 3 —4% of the A,- to be 0 after convergence. Analyzing the
shift updates also provides information about potentially unreliable
modeled regions, indicated by either very few or very many A
updates, as shown in Figure 10. The relative number of A changes
by the GA with respect to the total number of generations until
convergence is shown over all spectra. The various metabolites are
indicated by different symbol shapes and shadings.

One can clearly see that for most A (indicated by the symbols),
around 40% of the GA generations are sufﬁcient to obtain a stable
solution. Even if this solution may not be a global optimum, it can
still be considered as a stable local optimum. For some of the A
(e.g. those for pyruvate and aspartate), a (much) larger number of
updates is necessary and it can be expected that these shifts are
not well optimized, but that no better solution could be found by
the GA. For some of the other metabolites, one can also see that
only a single group is optimized very frequently as is the case for
the group of Val (valine) around 0.98 ppm or Ser (serine) around
3.83 ppm. The concentration estimates for these two amino acids
compare quite well with the expert estimates. Very few updates
can be observed e.g. for Succ (succinate) around 2.39 ppm, Gly
(glycine) around 3.55 ppm or Glu (glutamate) around 2ppm and
3.75 ppm. Interestingly Succ, Gly and Glu are optimized very well
and the estimated concentrations correspond reasonably to those
obtained by the expert. However, it should be borne in mind that the
concentration estimate is not equally split over the groups.

 

4Using the median in Figure 6 gives similar results with respect to TP but
comparing FUNC and EUC, the results are less pronounced due to the
dominance of the (many) small metabolites.

The plot in Figure 10 provides an initial indication of which
metabolites are most likely to have been poorly optimized and
should therefore be manually corrected by the expert. This provides
a basis for the focused and guided manual interaction avoiding
the inspection of all metabolites. In the example shown, the
optimizations appear to have been reasonably effective and correct
for those metabolites for which the number of updates for the
corresponding A lies within a range of 20—40%. The plots in
Figure 11 show the effect of the genetic evolution with respect to the
concentration of the metabolites and the parameter modiﬁcations.
One can see that most of the optimization of GA parameters and

the number of metabolites. It can be seen that the new approach clearly improves
the concentration estimates. The number of generations until convergence is shown in

hence of concentration changes occurs in the ﬁrst 10—20 generations.
The plot also shows that even relatively small errors in the A ,- may
have large impact on the concentration estimates, with very high
values at the beginning of the optimization and comparatively small
values at the end for some metabolites.

Median relative error estimates of single metabolites using TP
and ETP (FUNC) are shown in the Box—Whisker plot 8. The relative
error is calculated as the absolute concentration error compared
with the expert value. In terms of the median errors, we ﬁnd that

ETP provides a clear improvement over TP but has still problems
with some metabolites such as Leu, Meth, Phe and Pyr. In these
cases, however, we note that even the manual ﬁt by the expert is
challenging. On average, the median error improved from 0.78 to
0.64 with 0 as the perfect agreement. These ﬁndings show that ETP
is superior to TP in providing reasonable estimates for metabolites
on a magnitude level. However, the accuracy attainable from single
measurements is still low. This highlights the need for both the use
of experimental replicates and for the analysis of multiple spectra
of the same sample.

5 CONCLUSION

In summary, this work has shown that an approach combining
GAs with LSQO leads to highly effective error estimates for the
shift uncertainties in 1H NMR measurements. The simultaneous ﬁt
outperforms the standard TP approach with respect to identiﬁcation
and quantiﬁcation accuracy and compares favorably to the expert
analysis. We have further shown that the usage of a data—speciﬁc

preferable to a standard Euclidean measure. It also signiﬁcantly
improved the convergence rate of the GA. The interpretation of
the obtained shifts over time with the best model allows an in—depth
analysis of the optimization, revealing potentially unreliable ﬁts.
This provides initial guidance for the expert to focus further manual
improvement of the obtained ﬁt where necessary, reducing the
demand for extensive shift corrections in order to generate correct
uncertainty estimates. Furthermore, the approach also allows the
manual speciﬁcation of concentration values in the ﬁt for known
concentrations by additional constraints. Overall, the combined
approach can improve the identiﬁcation and quantiﬁcation accuracy

ABSTRACT

Motivation: To provide consistent computable descriptions of pheno-
type data, PomBase is developing a formal ontology of phenotypes
observed in fission yeast.

Results: The fission yeast phenotype ontology (FYPO) is a modular
ontology that uses several existing ontologies from the open biological
and biomedical ontologies (OBO) collection as building blocks, includ-
ing the phenotypic quality ontology PATO, the Gene Ontology and
Chemical Entities of Biological Interest. Modular ontology develop-
ment facilitates partially automated effective organization of detailed
phenotype descriptions with complex relationships to each other and
to underlying biological phenomena. As a result, FYPO supports
sophisticated querying, computational analysis and comparison be-
tween different experiments and even between species.

Availability: FYPO releases are available from the Subversion reposi-
tory at the PomBase SourceForge project page (https://sourceforge.
net/p/pombase/code/HEAD/tree/phenotype_ontology/). The current
version of FYPO is also available on the OBO Foundry Web site
(http://obofoundry.org/).

1 INTRODUCTION

The ﬁssion yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe is a eukaryotic
model organism that has been used since the 19503 to study di-
verse biological processes including the cell division cycle,
genome organization and maintenance, cell morphology and
cytokinesis, signaling and stress responses, chromatin, gene regu-
lation and meiotic differentiation (Egel, 2004). A large and active
research community uses a wide variety of molecular genetic, cell
biological and biochemical techniques to study S.p0mbe. With
the completion of its genome sequence in 2002 Wood et al.,
2002), fission yeast has also become amenable to genome-scale
experimentation, and has emerged as a reliable model for study-
ing processes involved in human disease and cell biology.
PomBase (http://www.pombase.org) has recently been estab-
lished as a comprehensive model organism database that pro-
vides centralized access to information relevant to S.p0mbe
Wood et al., 2012). PomBase encompasses a core of manual
literature curation that provides detailed accurate curation of
phenotypes, Gene Ontology (GO) annotations, genetic and phys-
ical interactions, protein modifications and many other types of

data describing genes and their products. Manually curated data
are supplemented by automatic gene annotation and large-scale
datasets, and information about additional sequence feature
types.

We define a phenotype as an observable characteristic, or set
of characteristics, of an organism that results from the inter-
action of its genotype with a given environment. Extensive gen-
etics research has been carried out using S.p0mbe over several
decades, and a comprehensive set of high-quality curated pheno-
type data is in high demand in the S.p0mbe research community.
A survey of S.p0mbe researchers conducted in 2007 identified
phenotype annotation as the most requested feature not then
available in a fission yeast database.

In response to community demand, we have developed the
Fission Yeast Phenotype Ontology (FYPO), a formal ontology
of phenotypes observed in fission yeast that will allow PomBase
to provide consistent computable descriptions of phenotype
data. Using FYPO, we have begun to curate accurate and de-
tailed annotations of mutant allele phenotypes, with the aim of
providing comprehensive coverage of phenotypes reported in the
fission yeast literature. FYPO annotations are available on
PomBase gene pages, and we envisage that the availability of
genome-scale phenotype datasets will make new types of data
analysis possible. Facilitated by the formal structure of FYPO,
phenotype annotations can be shared and integrated with add-
itional data, including other types of data obtained in fission
yeast as well as phenotype data from other species.

2 APPROACH

The application of ontologies to biological curation has become
widespread, and is best illustrated by the GO project (http://
www.geneontology.org) (The Gene Ontology Consortium 2000,
2012), a collaborative effort to construct and use controlled voca-
bularies to support functional annotation of genes and their
products in a wide variety of organisms. Ontologies facilitate
consistent unambiguous descriptions of biological concepts,
and can accommodate content at different levels of taxon speci-
ﬁcity. Ontologies allow annotations at different levels of granu-
larity, depending on what is known or what can be inferred,
and provide mechanisms for quality control, consistency check-
ing and error correction using collected data (both within and
between ontologies). We sought to make these advantages avail-
able to curators and database users of PomBase phenotype
annotations.

GeneDB S.pombe (http://old.genedb.org/genedb/pombe/), the
predecessor database to PomBase, offered an extensive set of GO
annotations, but did not use ontologies to capture other data
types. GeneDB provided minimal phenotype annotation using
a small, manually constructed, controlled vocabulary. The
phenotype vocabulary was a ﬂat list of ~200 text descriptions,
with no connections between the different descriptions.
Furthermore, because the GeneDB phenotype vocabulary was
designed and used exclusively for S.pombe annotations, it did not
support any data sharing or integration between species or
databases.

The launch of PomBase presented an opportunity to create an
improved system for phenotype description, starting with a
‘blank slate’ and unconstrained by the limitations of the
GeneDB vocabulary and annotation system.

2.1 Ontology design considerations

2.1.1 The entity—quality model We have constructed FYPO as a
modular ontology that uses several existing ontologies from the
open biological and biomedical ontologies (OBO) collection
(Smith et al., 2007) as building blocks to support the creation
and maintenance of an extensive set of pre—coordinated pheno-
type descriptors. Terms from OBO ontologies, including the
phenotypic quality ontology PATO (Gkoutos et al., 2009), the
G0, the Cell Ontology (CL; Meehan et al., 2011) and Chemical
Entities of Biological Interest (ChEBI) (de Matos et al., 2010),
are used to construct logical deﬁnitions for FYPO terms. For a
phenotype, a logical deﬁnition follows the entity—quality (EQ)
model (Mabee et al., 2007): the entity is what is affected, and can
be the whole cell, a population of cells, a part of a cell (corres-
ponding to a G0 cellular component) or an event such as a
molecular function or biological process (represented by GO
terms). An entity speciﬁcation can be further reﬁned with add-
itional details using GO or ChEBI terms. The quality describes
how the entity is affected, and is captured by a PATO term.

2.1.2 Evaluation of available ontologies and term
composition Before commencing FYPO development, we
examined the phenotype ontologies listed with the OBO
Foundry, of which the Ascomycete Phenotype Ontology (APO;
http://www.yeastgenome.org/cache/PhenotypeTree.html), de-
veloped for Saccharomyces cerevisiae (budding yeast) (Engel
et al., 2010) and other fungi, most closely matches FYPO in
scope and intended application. Our evaluation was guided by
the requirements of our highest-priority phenotype ontology ap-
plications. Most importantly, we require an extensive set of pre-
composed phenotype terms for community annotation and
querying.

Existing phenotype ontologies typically use one of two
approaches: In a pre—coordinated (or pre—composed) ontology,
such as the Mammalian Phenotype Ontology (Smith and Eppig,
2009), phenotype descriptions are composed in advance (i.e. sep-
arately from the annotation procedure). In other systems, such as
Dictyostelium discoideum (Fey et al., 2009) and Danio rerio
(zebraﬁsh) (Bradford et al., 2011), phenotype descriptions are
post-coordinated (post-composed) at the time of annotation; a
curator chooses an entity and quality, and in some cases add-
itional details, in parallel.

Phenotype annotation is one of the key features of PomBase’s
newly developed community curation system (Rutherford et al.,
manuscript in preparation), which allows researchers to contrib-
ute annotations from their publications directly to the database.
For use by bench biologists, the simpler procedure of annotating
to a single pre-composed term is more intuitive than the parallel
annotation process required with post-composition. We also an-
ticipate that biologists will wish to annotate to highly speciﬁc
terms, making the reasoning supported by logical EQ deﬁnitions
essential for ontology maintenance.

Annotations using APO terms, however, fall into the post-
composed category: terms representing qualities and ‘observ—
ables’ are combined by curators as part of the annotation
procedure. Thus, although phenotype descriptions using APO
are conceptually compatible with the EQ model, entity—quality
combinations are not incorporated into APO itself, nor do APO
terms include logical deﬁnitions. Finally, curators using APO
often add details drawn from other sources, including separate
controlled vocabularies, meaning that much of the speciﬁc infor-
mation captured in APO annotations is not incorporated into the
ontology.

An additional ontology design consideration reﬂects distinct-
ive features of ﬁssion yeast biology. S.pombe represents an early-
diverging lineage within the Ascomycota (Taphrinomycota, for-
merly also known as Archiascomycetes) (James et al., 2006). To
accurately and consistently describe ﬁssion yeast phenotypes, we
could reasonably expect to need speciﬁc terms that would not
apply to the other ascomycete fungi (Saccharomycotina and
Pezizomycotina) that have been annotated using APO. A new
ontology offers maximal freedom to ﬁt ﬁssion yeast-speciﬁc
terms into a more general framework, without extensively
restructuring an already-deployed vocabulary.

For these reasons, we have opted to develop FYPO independ-
ently despite the similarity in scope to APO.

2.2 Ontology content

2.2.] High-level organization At the broadest level of classiﬁca-
tion, FYPO organizes terms along three axes. One axis distin-
guishes normal from abnormal phenotypes, where ‘normal’ is
operationally deﬁned as indistinguishable from characteristics
of cells isogenic to the sequenced wild-type strain (972 h—),
and ‘abnormal’ as detectably different from wild type, under
the conditions in which a phenotype is assessed in a particular
experiment.

A second axis classiﬁes phenotypes by the entity affected; the
broad categories correspond to effects on biological processes (as
deﬁned in GO), molecular functions (GO) or cellular structures
(corresponding to GO cellular components). The third axis dis-
tinguishes phenotypes relevant at the level of a cell are from
those that can be observed only in a population of cells.

Table 1 shows the top-level classiﬁcations in FYPO, with the
numbers of is_a descendants and cumulative annotations for
each term.

2.2.2 Representing common types of phenotype Further classiﬁ-
cation of the phenotype terms in FYPO, and their logical deﬁn-
itions, reﬂects several general categories into which phenotypes
fall.

Some phenotypes, such as cell morphology, affect the entire
cell (represented by the root of the Cell Ontology, CL:0000000).
Morphological changes are also observed at the subcellular level,
corresponding to GO cellular component terms. Phenotypes that
affect cell size or shape refer to morphology qualities from
PATO, as do phenotypes involving aberrant subcellular
structures.

The largest category of phenotypes are those that affect (or
inhere in) an entity corresponding to a G0 biological process, i.e.
phenotypes in which a cellular process does not proceed exactly
as in wild-type cells. A smaller, but conceptually similar, group
includes phenotypes that affect GO molecular functions such as
binding or enzymatic activities. Phenotypes that affect biological
processes and molecular functions refer to the corresponding GO
terms, combined with PATO terms describing the alteration, e. g.
‘abolished’, ‘delayed’, ‘advanced’ (onset) or increased or
decreased rate or frequency of occurrence.

Growth of cells on plates or in liquid medium is often evalu-
ated, and changes in growth under speciﬁc conditions is taken to
represent sensitivity (as in the case of cell death or decreased
growth rate or yield) or resistance (unchanged or increased
growth rate or yield) to a stimulus. Sensitivity to various chem-
icals can be modeled by combining the PATO term ‘increased
sensitivity of a process’ with the GO biological process ‘vegeta-
tive growth of a single-celled organism’ and a ChEBI term rep-
resenting the substance. Resistance to a chemical follows the
same model, using PATO ‘decreased sensitivity of a process’.
Sensitivity and resistance to stimuli other than chemical sub-
stances follow a similar pattern, but refer to GO terms for cel-
lular responses to the stimuli. For example, ‘sensitive to osmotic
stress’ (FYPO:0000270) refers to the GO term ‘cellular response
to osmotic stress’ (GO:0071470).

In addition to PATO, GO and ChEBI, FYPO draws on the
Sequence Ontology (SO) (Eilbeck et al., 2005) for a small number
of terms that refer to speciﬁc DNA or RNA sequence regions, a
small number of Cell Ontology (CL) terms to distinguish pheno-
types that affect vegetatively growing cells or spores and a single
term the BRENDA Tissue Ontology (BTO) (Gremse et al., 2011)
is used for phenotypes that depend on, or affect, the growth
medium.

Table 2 summarizes the usage of OBO ontology terms in
FYPO.

number of terms that do not ﬁt the simple logical models

described above. The principal types are complex phenotypes,
which encompass more than one quality, and phenotypes that
affect cell populations.

Complex phenotypes can be represented as having simpler
phenotypes as parts. To illustrate, Figure 1 shows the portion
of FYPO describing ‘mitotic catastrophe’ phenotypes, which
arise when defects in mitotic chromosome segregation lead to
cell death. The most general mitotic catastrophe term
(FYPO:0001047) is deﬁned as the combination of ‘inviable’
(FYPO:0000049) with ‘abnormal mitotic sister chromatid segre-
gation’ (FYPO:0000141). Because mitotic catastrophe may occur
with one or more additional features such as altered cell shape or
size or a ‘cut’ phenotype (i.e. septation despite abnormal chro-
mosome segregation), several more speciﬁc terms are included,
and their logical deﬁnitions specify the additional parts. ‘Mitotic
catastrophe with cut’ (FYPO:0001048), for example, has the add-
itional parts ‘cut’ (FYPO:0000229) and ‘mistimed mitosis’
(FYPO:0001204), whereas ‘mitotic catastrophe, elongated cells’
(FYPO:0001051) adds FYPO:0001204 and ‘elongated vegetative
cells’ (FYPO:0001122). All biologically relevant combinatorial
possibilities can be built, including ‘mitotic catastrophe with
cut, elongated cells’ (FYPO:0001054).

Although most ﬁssion yeast phenotypes can be represented as
properties of a cell (including events taking place in a cell), some

Fig. 1. Several speciﬁc types of mitotic catastrophe have been deﬁned based on whether cell size or shape is affected, and whether the cells undergo
septation despite the failure of chromosome segregation (‘cut’ phenotype). As the different speciﬁc mitotic catastrophe phenotypes support different

interpretations of the underlying biology, the distinctions among these

related phenotypes are valuable for downstream applications of phenotype

annotations. (A) Graphical view of terms and is_a relationships, which classify the terms. More speciﬁc terms build on less speciﬁc terms by addition of
differentiating features. A complex phenotype such as ‘mitotic catastrophe with cut, elongated cells’ has multiple paths to the root (most general term) of
the ontology via different parents, allowing annotations at any level of speciﬁcity. Also note that the paths in FYPO parallel the paths describing mitosis
and the cell cycle in GO as well as those in the cell morphology area of FYPO. (B) OBO stanza deﬁning FYPO:0001054 ‘mitotic catastrophe with cut,

phenotypes can only be observed at the level of a population.
These cell population phenotypes reﬂect properties of what cells
do in groups, and pose particular challenges for logical modeling
because they do not represent characteristics of a single

organism. Some examples are colony morphology (‘abnormal
colony morphology’ FYPO:0000150), ﬂocculation (‘ﬂocculating
cells’ FYPO:0000155) and ﬁlament morphology. Some cellular
processes can also be studied in cell populations, giving rise to

population-level phenotype observations; one example is sept-
ation, for which the ‘septation index’, i.e. the proportion of
cells in a population observed undergoing septation under
given conditions is often measured. Although FYPO:0000155
is deﬁned as ‘increased occurrence’ (PATO:0002051) of ‘ﬂoccu-
lation’ (GO:0000128), most cell population phenotype terms are
among the small fraction in FYPO that do not yet have logical
deﬁnitions.

To accurately model some phenotypes has required the intro-
duction of a few relations that are not deﬁned in the OBO
Relations Ontology (RO; http://code.google.com/p/obo-rela
tions/) or the Basic Formal Ontology (BFO; http://www.ifomis.
org/bfo/) at present. Some, such as during and its subtypes
exists_during and happens_during, which are used to link process
or structural phenotypes to periods such as cell cycle phases, are
borrowed from a set of relations developed by the GO
Consortium for its annotation extensions (Huntley et al., manu-
script in preparation). Others, such as includes_cells_with_pheno-
type, which links cell population phenotypes with cell-level
phenotypes of cells within the population, have been created
speciﬁcally for FYPO and will be submitted as candidates for
addition to RO.

2.2.3 Current advantages of FYPO usage FYPO’s modular
structure and formal logical deﬁnitions confer a number of ad-
vantages, as speciﬁed below:

In ontology development, it is feasible to manage a large set of
terms, to deﬁne phenotypes precisely and to represent phenotype
descriptions with complex relationships to each other and to
underlying biological phenomena. Reasoning software can use
FYPO’s logical deﬁnitions to infer links between terms and to
detect redundancy and other errors, which streamlines ontology
development. Furthermore, because the deﬁnitions refer directly
and speciﬁcally to terms from other OBO ontologies, reasoning
over FYPO also keeps its structure consistent with external
ontologies such as GO, ChEBI and PATO. Text details are

A

also more easily managed in FYPO than in a ﬂat, manually
managed, list. For example, synonymous words and phrases
can be included to aid querying. Minor inconsistencies, such as
misspellings and duplications, are easily avoided.

In addition to facilitating ontology development and quality
control, FYPO supports much more effective manual curation
than the legacy vocabulary from GeneDB. With many more
speciﬁc terms, annotators can capture much richer, more detailed
phenotype information. The text and logical deﬁnitions help an-
notators maintain accuracy and consistency in using a large set
of ontology terms.

Both the increased speciﬁcity and the structure of the ontology
also support sophisticated querying and computational analysis.

Terms and annotations relevant to cytokinesis phenotypes i1-
1ustrate many of the improvements that FYPO has facilitated.
This topic is one of a number in which the GeneDB vocabulary
had a general descriptor such as ‘phenotype, cytokinesis defects’
included as a substring of more speciﬁc entries such as ‘pheno-
type, cytokinesis defects, contractile ring, absent’, but the terms
were not otherwise related. Although a text search for the more
general string would ﬁnd both terms, a search for genes anno-
tated to the general term would not retrieve genes annotated to
the more speciﬁc term. In contrast, the FYPO term ‘abnormal
actomyosin contractile ring assembly’ (FYPO:0000161) has a lo-
gical deﬁnition that states that the quality ‘abnormal’
(PATO:0000460) inheres_in the process of actomyosin contractile
ring assembly during cytokinesis (GO:0000915,’cytokinesis, acto-
myosin contractile ring assembly’). (Inheres_in formally states
that the PATO quality is an attribute of the GO process or
other affected entity.) Figure 2 shows the logical deﬁnition for
FYPO:0000161 in Manchester syntax and OBO format. The
classiﬁcation of the phenotype term in FYPO parallels that of
the biological process term in GO, in which ‘actomyosin con-
tractile ring assembly’ is both a type of ‘actin cytoskeleton or-
ganization’ and a part of ‘cytokinesis’. Any mutant alleles
annotated to FYPO:0000161 can therefore be retrieved by

queries for mutations that affect the actin cytoskeleton as well as
those affecting cytokinesis.

Normal phenotypes are represented in FYPO using the same
logical structures, and at the same level of detail, as abnormal
phenotypes. Fission yeast is particularly amenable to normal
phenotype annotation because the commonly used laboratory
strains are all isogenic, making unambiguous recognition of
normal, and therefore also abnormal, characteristics straightfor-
ward. Annotation of normal phenotypes allows curators to
document mutations that cause no phenotypic changes with re-
spect to certain assays, or under standard growth conditions.
This provides important, albeit negative, information about
gene function, and makes the total set of ﬁssion yeast phenotypes
more comprehensive. For example, deletion of the small GTPase
Rasl causes defects in conjugation (mating) and sporulation
(Herskowitz, 1995; Hughes et al., 1990; Papadaki et al., 2002).
Deletion of the Rasl-activating guanyl nucleotide exchange pro-
tein Ste6, however, causes defects only in conjugation. The
normal sporulation phenotype observed in the ste6 null mutant
indicates that Rasl must have other regulators and downstream
effectors besides Ste6.

3 METHODS

FYPO is built using OBO-Edit (Day-Richter et al., 2007). Logical deﬁn-
itions are constructed in OBO-Edit for each term that can be represented
as described in the PATO XP best practices (http://obofoundry.org/wiki/
index.php/PATO:XP_Best_Practice). In particular, FYPO uses inheres_in
both for qualities of processes and physical entities, as is common in other
related efforts (Mungall et al., 2010). It has since transpired that future
versions of BFO may prohibit this usage, in which case we will either
modify the pattern we use, or use a broader relation, which will be
incorporated in R0 (C.J.Mungall, personal communication). The initial
set of FYPO terms was based on a set of 208 free-text descriptors used to
annotate deletion (null) phenotypes in GeneDB. Additional terms were
generated by combining a PATO quality with G0 terms frequently used
in S. pombe annotations supported by phenotypic evidence (using the
evidence ‘inferred from mutant phenotype’, IMP). In ongoing FYPO
development, terms are added or modiﬁed as needed to describe pheno-
types in published literature accurately and precisely. Term requests may
come from PomBase curators or community researchers. Regular releases
of FYPO are generated using the OBO Ontology Release Tool (Oort;
http://code.google.com/p/owltools/wiki/Oort), and include OBO and
OWL formats. Reasoning uses the ELK reasoner (Kazakov et al.,
2011) as part of the Oort release process. Links inferred by the reasoner
during the Oort release are reviewed periodically, and any ontology errors
that cause anomalous inferences are corrected.

4 DISCUSSION

We have developed a formal ontology of phenotypes observed in
ﬁssion yeast, which now includes over 1900 terms, to support
phenotype curation in PomBase.

4.1 Applications of FYPO

The primary application of FYPO is to provide the phenotype
information demanded by the S.pombe research community, ini-
tially in the form of annotations displayed on PomBase gene
pages, detailing alleles, type of supporting evidence, and litera-
ture citations as well as FYPO terms. At present all ﬁssion

phenotype annotation is supported by published experimental
data which has been manually curated. To date, over 6000
legacy annotations have been converted from the GeneDB con-
trolled vocabulary to FYPO terms, and a comparable number of
new annotations have been curated.

Enhanced phenotype description using FYPO supports
curation of both classical low-throughput and emerging high-
throughput experiments. The latter will become increasingly
important as researchers use the genome-wide deletion collection
that has recently become available; genome-wide viability data
are published (Kim et al., 2010) and many more comprehensive
phenotype screens are possible. We also include phenotype cur-
ation in the new community curation tool (Rutherford et al.,
manuscript in preparation), which enables us to incorporate
phenotype annotations, along with supporting data on alleles
and experimental conditions, directly from expert researchers.
Moreover, because users can request new phenotype terms, com-
munity contributions offer substantial beneﬁts to the phenotype
ontology itself as well as the collection of S.pombe phenotype
annotations.

As high-throughput experiments become more common, and
manual curation of phenotypes from small-scale experiments be-
comes more complete, the body of S.pombe phenotype data will
become sufﬁciently comprehensive to support enrichment ana-
lyses analogous to those routinely performed using GO annota-
tions (for example, see Deshpande et al., 2009; Helmlinger et al.,
2008; Kim et al., 2010; Marguerat et al., 2012; Shimanuki et al.,
2007; Xue-Franzén et al.,2006). We anticipate that comprehen-
sive phenotype annotation, and analyses thereof, will comple-
ment GO annotation data. PomBase curators have begun
reviewing GO annotations based on mutant phenotypes, to
remove those that are known to represent indirect ‘downstream’
effects. Many experimenters, however, will likely want to include
both direct and indirect effects when analysing processes over- or
under-represented in gene sets. The use of phenotype annotations
to capture indirect effects, combined with G0 annotations rep-
resenting direct effects, allows us to maintain the direct—indirect
distinction while supporting comprehensive enrichment analyses.
As an example, a number of genes, such as the endoplasmic
reticulum calcium-transporting ATPase Cta4, the pantothenate
transporter Lizl, the mitochondrial DNA polymerase Pogl and
the DNA replication factor A subunit Ssbl, have annotations to
FYPO terms describing cytokinesis defects, but are not anno-
tated to cytokinesis in GO. FYPO annotations will also provide
access to statistical over-representation of gene lists for cellular
phenomena that fall outside the scope of GO (such as drug sen-
sitivity, cell shape defects, cell lysis, etc.). We further speculate
that sets of mutants will emerge with the same phenotypic sig-
natures but distinct GO categories, which would suggest that
distinct sets of proteins may be involved (directly or indirectly)
in the same cellular processes; such features would not be imme-
diately evident from GO annotation alone.

4.2 Logical structure and data integration

We have opted to pre—compose FYPO terms, primarily to sim-
plify the annotation process. Although pre— and post-composed
terms may be semantically equivalent, the parallel annotation
process required with post-composition is not well suited to

community curation. The simpler procedure of annotating to a
single pre-composed term is more intuitive for bench biologists.

Because >90% of FYPO terms have logical EQ deﬁnitions,
however, we can also realize the beneﬁts of explicit references to
other OBO ontologies and reasoning. Notably, FYPO is com-
patible with the Cell Phenotype Ontology (CPO) (Hoehndorf
et al., 2012), a species-neutral ontology of morphological and
physiological phenotypic characteristics of cells, cell components
and cellular processes that supports automated synchronization
with G0 and integration of cellular phenotype data across spe-
cies. Like CPO, FYPO deﬁnes many phenotypes at the cellular
level, in terms of cellular processes or structures (both referring
to GO) and how they are affected (referring to PATO). The
shared aspects of phenotype representation mean that FYPO
will be able to take advantage of CPO’s automated synchroniza-
tion to maintain consistency with G0 and PATO. Conversely,
the inclusion of FYPO and its associated ﬁssion yeast phenotype
annotations provide CPO with a set of high-quality data repre-
senting an important model organism, enriching its integrated
datasets.

On a related note, the developers of the Ontology of Microbial
Phenotypes (OMP; http://microbialphenotypes.org/) are taking a
similar approach to construct EQ-based descriptions of pheno-
types observed in microorganisms, especially in Escherichia coli.
As considerable overlap in scope is likely between OMP and
FYPO, the common underlying ontology structure will facilitate
possible future integration of ontology terms or annotation data.
Because EQ model-based phenotype integration methods can be
used to align pre- and post-composed phenotype terms (Mungall
et al., 2010), we can also explore ways to align APO with FYPO
to improve sharing of phenotype descriptions and annotation
data.

4.3 Future work

As manual curation of phenotypes continues, we will add terms
to FYPO as required, and we will explore ways to improve
formal phenotype representations. For example, we anticipate
that the recently launched Population and Community
Ontology (PCO; http://code.google.com/p/popcomm—ontology/)
will provide terms that can be incorporated into logical deﬁn-
itions for FYPO population phenotypes.

We also envision extending FYPO to accommodate high-
throughput experiments. For example, we will add complex
phenotypes such as whole-transcriptome signatures used for
expression quantitative trait locus mapping. High-throughput
screens will also capture quantitative data associated with pheno-
types such as growth rates, survival rates following stress, or cell
size and shape. Few of the challenges of modeling quantitative
phenotypes have been met among the broader community of
ontology developers working on phenotype representation, but
we will work with both S.pombe researchers and ontology devel-
opers to meet emerging community needs.

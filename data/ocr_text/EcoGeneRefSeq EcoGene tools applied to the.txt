ABSTRACT

Summary: EcoGene.org is a genome database and website dedi-
cated to Escherichia coli K—12 substrain MG1655 that is revised
daily using information derived from the biomedical literature and
in-house analysis. EcoGene is a major source of annotation updates
for the MG1655 Genbank record, one of only a few Genbank genome
records that are updated by a community effort. The Reference
Sequence (RefSeq) database, built by The National Center for
Biotechnology Information, comprises a set of duplicate Genbank
genome records that can be modified by the NCBI staff annotators.
EcoGene-RefSeq is being developed as a stand-alone internet
resource to facilitate the usage of EcoGene-based tools on any of
the >2400 completed prokaryotic genome records that are currently
available at the RefSeq database.

Availability: The web interface of EcoGene-RefSeq is available at
http://www.ecogene.org/refseq.

1 INTRODUCTION

New sequencing technologies have signiﬁcantly increased the
volume of genomic sequence data that are being generated.
The NCBI RefSeq collection is a curated sequence database
providing a comprehensive, non-redundant and annotated set
of sequences representing naturally occurring DNA, RNA and
proteins (Pruitt et al., 2012). Included are taxonomically diverse
sequences from plasmids, organelles, viruses, archaea, bacteria
and eukaryotes. The Escherichia coli K-12 MG1655 genome
was the third sequenced genome and is represented by the
Genbank UOOO96 complete genome record (Blattner et al.,
1997), which has been extensively revised since its original
submission (Riley et al., 2006; Rudd, 2000; Zhou and Rudd,
2013). EcoGene was developed to maintain, display, query and
document the revised genome and proteome sequences and
annotations. EcoGene is the modern version of the historical
E.coli K-12 genetic maps (Rudd, 1998). A suite of customized
tools has been developed for EcoGene, providing functionality
that is unavailable elsewhere. We are now making these tools
available for viewing and retrieving genomic maps and sequences
for any prokaryotic genome sequence through EcoGene-RefSeq.

The applications ported from EcoGene to EcoGene-Refseq
include (i) PrimerPairs, a tool for automatically designing
genome-wide sets of primers to engineer either a clone library
or a deletion strain library (Zhou and Rudd, 2011), (ii) Search
and Download, a search interface for querying and downloading
gene information, (iii) GenePages, web pages displaying individ-
ual genes as well as dynamic gene maps and restriction sites maps
for genome navigation and (iv) Cross Reference Mapping and
Download, a tool for accessing many additional gene identiﬁers.
EcoGene-RefSeq is powered by the open source content man-
agement platform Drupal and supported by a MySQL database.
All data stored in the EcoGene-RefSeq MySQL database are
faithfully parsed from RefSeq for efficient retrieval.

2 RESULTS
2.1 Data parsing

The RefSeq database is made freely available and can be
accessed through several methods, including FTP downloading,
internet query and script. In our implementation, only completed
prokaryotic genomes, including bacterial and archaeal species,
are considered. Project information about the frequently updated
completed prokaryotic genomes is obtained from the genome
report at NCBI’s ftp site (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genomes/
GENOME_REPORTS/). The report contains detailed genome
project information grouped by major taxonomic division. These
taxonomic division reports include information on genome data
submitted to the primary archival sequence data that are
exchanged among members of the International Nucleotide
Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) and genome data
represented in NCBI’s RefSeq dataset. Detailed genome records
that are used to parse data elements into EcoGene-RefSeq data-
base are obtained from ftp: //ftp.ncbi.nih.gov/genomes/Bacteria/ .
RefSeq offers several different types of ﬁles to store genomic
records, one of which we use is the Genetic Feature Format
Version 3(GFF 3). Hypertext preprocessor (PHP, http://www.
php.net) scripts were written to parse, extract, reformat, con-
struct data elements and interact with a MySQL database
(http://www.mysql.com/) for storage and querying. The
EcoGene-RefSeq MySQL database is designed to efficiently
store and query the parsed data as shown in Figure 1.

All data in EcoGene-RefSeq are faithfully parsed from
RefSeq, and no attempt is made to curate or re-annotate. The
EcoGene-RefSeq MySQL database is updated daily from
RefSeq records to include newly added records, and it is also

2.2 Usage

A web interface is provided for searching and viewing all the
completed prokaryotic genomes stored in the EcoGene-RefSeq
database. Genome records can be searched by domain, type,
name, RefSeq or Genbank accession numbers. Each genome
sequence has a summary page reporting the stable accession
numbers, plasmid information and the related publications
from the BioProject (Barrett et al., 2012). The summary page
also provides the numbers of proteins genes, RNA genes and
pseudogenes with internal linkers to access each of these cate-
gories directly at the Search and Download page, allowing the
user to download details of each gene in the category. A set of
web-based applications are ported from EcoGene to all prokary-
otic genomes stored in the EcoGene-RefSeq database, including:

2.2.] Search and Download This interface allows for retrieval of
a list of genes by querying gene names, IDs, products and other
ﬁelds, which can subsequently be downloaded and applied to
other applications using only these user-speciﬁed genes. For ex-
ample, the user can upload the speciﬁed genes to PrimerPairs and
get a desired primer pair subset.

2.2.2 Gene Index and GenePage The Gene Index page, pro-
vided for each genome, is an alphabetical index to the individual
GenePages. The GenePage contains text information about
DNA sequence and gene product with external linkers to their
sources at NCBI and UniProtKB. In addition, three regional
maps (a dynamic Gene Map, a Feature Map and an interactive
restriction Sites Map) are created in the Portable Network
Graphic (PNG) format that can be saved for use in publications
and presentations. The Gene Map is an interactive display that
depicts a default 10 kb region of genomic DNA with user ability
to zoom for a shorter more detailed region and click internal
linkers to other nearby GenePages. The Feature Map depicts

IS elements and intergenic repeats. The Site Map depicts all
the restriction sites for up to seven user-speciﬁed restriction
enzymes, with three restriction enzymes (BamHI, EcoRI and
HindIII) used as the default selection. Every gene in EcoGene-
RefSeq has a GenePage accessible through the internal linkers at
the Search and Download page, Gene Index page or through a
URL using the genome’s RefSeq accession number and unique
GeneID assigned by NCBI.

2.2.3 PrimerPairs PrimerPairs is a web application that allows
for automatic genome-wide polymerase chain reaction primer
design enabling the deletion or cloning of all genes in a
genome (Zhou and Rudd, 2011). The DNA fragments these pri-
mers amplify can be used to implement a genome re-engineering
strategy using complementary in vitro cloning and in vivo re-
combineering. The integration of a primer design tool with a
completed genome database increases the level of quality control.
PrimerPairs can automatically detect and correct overlapping
deletion primers because of integration with the genome annota-
tion in the EcoGene-Refseq database.

2.2.4 Cross Reference Mapping The Cross Reference Mapping
and Download page is created for user access to many additional
accession numbers and other gene identiﬁers, such as gene name
and the NCBI Gene ID that are collected in RefSeq records. The
cross references facilitate both hyperlink construction and the
integration of experimental and bioinformatics results.

3 CONCLUSION

EcoGene-RefSeq is developed to facilitate the usage of a set of
tools available at EcoGene with any prokaryotic genome. In the
future, we can add capabilities into EcoGene-RefSeq, including
manual curation tools enabling an individual or interested group
to build and re-annotate an EcoGene-like database for any pro-
karyotic genome.

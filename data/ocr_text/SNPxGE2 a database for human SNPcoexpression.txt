ABSTRACT

Motivation: Recently, gene—coexpression relationships have been
found to be often conditional and dynamic. Many studies have
suggested that single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) have
impacts on gene expression variations in human populations.
Results: The SNPxGE2 database contains the computationally
predicted human SNP—coexpression associations, i.e. the differential
coexpression between two genes is associated with the genotypes
of an SNP. These data were generated from a large-scale association
study that was based on the HapMap phase I data, which covered
269 individuals from 4 human populations, 556 873 SNPs and 15 000
gene expression profiles. In order to reduce the computational
cost, the SNP—coexpression associations were assessed using
gap/substitution models, proven to have a comparable power to
logistic regression models. The results, at a false discovery rate (FDR)
cutoff of 0.1, consisted of 44 769 and 50792 SNP—coexpression
associations based on single and pooled populations, respectively,
and can be queried in the SNPxGE2 database via either gene symbol
or reference SNP ID. For each reported association, a detailed
information page is provided.

1 INTRODUCTION

It is widely accepted that eukaryotic gene expression variation
may be potentially modulated by many genetic and epigenetic
factors such as transcription factors, cis—regulatory elements,
enhancers/repressors, transposons, miRNAs, nucleosome position—
ing, DNA methylation, histone modiﬁcations and by environmental
factors (Idaghdour et al., 2010; Weirauch and Hughes, 2010; Wilson
and Odom, 2009; Wray et al., 2003). Moreover, much of gene
expression variation is heritable (Cheung et al., 2003).

Recently, many studies have suggested that single nucleotide
polymorphisms (SNPs) also have impacts on gene expression
variations in human populations. Stranger et al. (2005) found that
many regions within 1Mb of 374 expressed genes of interest
had signiﬁcant association of SNPs with expression variation.
Subsequently, Stranger et al. (2007a) performed association analyses
of expression levels of 14 925 transcripts with SNPs and copy

number variants using multiple linear regression and suggested
that SNPs captured 83.6% of the total detected genetic variation
in gene expression. Later on, Stranger et al. (2007b) carried out
another association analysis of >2.2 million common SNPs with
gene expression using multiple linear regression and identiﬁed
at least 1348 and 180 genes with association signals in cis
and trans effects, respectively. Spielman et al. (2007) suggested
that common genetic variants accounted for differences in gene
expression as well as prevalence of complex diseases among ethnic
groups. Duan et al. (2008) also reported several thousands of
signiﬁcant associations between expression quantitative nucleotides
and transcript clusters in two of HapMap populations. In a separate
study, Zhang et al. (2008) identiﬁed that some genes, which
were differentially expressed among human populations, were also
associated with particular biological processes. Using a Bayesian
hierarchical model, Veyrieras et al. (2008) found strong enrichments
of quantitative trait loci for gene expression (eQTLs) in 250 bp
upstream regions of transcription end site (TES) and around the
transcription start site (TSS). Similarly, Pickrell et al. (2010)
identiﬁed genetic variations in more than a thousand genes, which
inﬂuenced the overall gene expression or splicing.

In addition to individual gene expression proﬁles, the
relationships among transcripts such as coexpression are also
often studied for deciphering gene regulatory mechanisms. The
identiﬁcation of human gene—coexpression relationships using
microarray data has often relied on overall correlations between
gene expression proﬁles across many experiments or conditions
(Lee et al., 2004; Obayashi and Kinoshita, 2011). Recently, some
studies have suggested that the coexpression relationships between
genes are often dynamic and conditional, which may be dependent
on cellular states (Li et al., 2004), developmental stages (Adryan
and Teichmann, 2010), disease status (case or control) (Choi et al.,
2005) or human populations (Nayak et al., 2009). However, few
studies have related such differential coexpression to genetic bases.
The effects of SNPs on gene expression variation in humans have
been well documented, and so it is reasonable to conjecture that the
differential coexpression between two genes may be associated with
the genotypes of an SNP, which is termed as an SNP—coexpression
association in this study. Kayano et al. (2009) showed a biological
switch mechanism in coexpression between correlation and inverse
correlation of two genes, controlled by the genotypes of an
SNP. However, the switch mechanism in two genes’ coexpression
controlled by an SNP could be only part of the whole picture of
SNP—coexpression associations because it is also possible that two
genes are well coexpressed under individual genotypes of an SNP

while their coexpression cannot be detected if different genotypes
of the SNP are pooled, or that two genes are well coexpressed under
one or two genotypes of an SNP while are not coexpressed under
others. Furthermore, Kayano at 611. ’s method was only able to assess
3 X 108 SNP—expression—expression combinations, of which only
142 gene expression proﬁles were included, more than two orders
of magnitude fewer than what is typical in a genome—wide expression
data.

Studies of associations between larger number of transcripts and
genotypes data are computationally demanding. Thus, databases that
deposit pre—computed associations are informative and helpful to
biological researchers. For example, the SCAN database provides
queries of the results of association of HapMap variants with gene
expression at user—speciﬁed thresholds (Gamazon at 611., 2010).
Genevar allows researchers to investigate expression quantitative
trait loci (eQTL) associations within a gene locus of interest in
real time (Yang at 611., 2010). However, detecting genome—wide
SNP—coexpression associations, a type of three—way associations,
is more computationally intractable. Thus, a resource providing
the results of a comprehensive analysis of SNP—coexpression
associations, which are based on practical three—way association
models and large—scale computation, should be very informative
to the scientiﬁc community. In this study, we adopted an efﬁcient
method presented by Dettling at 611. (2005), which enabled us
to assess up to ~1013 SNP—expression—expression combinations.
The results are deposited in a freely available database named
SNPxGEZ.

2 METHODS
2.1 The raw data

There are different expression datasets available on the HapMap
samples [e.g. exon array (Duan et 611., 2008), Illumina (Stranger
et 611., 2007a), Affy focus (Spielman et 611., 2007)]. In this study,
normalized gene expression values (generated by Illumina Human WG—6
array) of 269 HapMap individuals from four populations including
90 CEPH trios of European descent (CEU), 90 Yoruba trios from
Nigeria (YRI), 45 unrelated Han Chinese from Beijing (CHB) and 44
unrelated Japanese from Tokyo (JPT) were downloaded from GENEVAR
(ftp:// ftp.sanger.ac.uk/pub/genevar/ CEU_children_ norm_march2007.zip,
CEU_parents_n0rm_march2007.zip, CHB_nonn_march2007.zip, J PT_
norm_march2007.zip, YRI_chi1dren_norm_march2007.zip & YRI_parents_
norm_march2007.zip) (Stranger e1611., 2007a; Yang e1611., 2010). Annotation
of Illumina Human WG—6 array was downloaded from ftp://ftp.sanger.ac.uk/
pub/genevar/illumina_Human_WG—6_array_content.csv. For each probe
set (transcript), only the lowest level gene ontology (GO) terms within
each of the three categories including biological process, molecular
function and cellular component were considered. Out of the 47 294
transcripts, 15 000 genes with the highest expression level variations,
which are more likely to have gene expression variations rather than
random variations, were selected for further analysis. The SNP genotypes
from phase I HapMap (ftp://ftp.ncbi.nlm.nih.g0v/hapmap/gen0types/2005—
06_16c_phaseI/full/redundant—ﬁltered/) were used (Gibbs etal., 2003).

Stranger e1611. (2007a).

2.2 Modeling SNP—coexpression associations

The SNP—coexpression associations of interest, i.e. the differential
coexpression between two genes is associated with the genotypes of an
SNP, have been proven to exist in humans by Kayano e1 611. (2009) based

on 142 gene expression proﬁles belonging to ﬁve disease pathways and
366 140 SNPs. However, Kayano e1611.’s method, which incorporated several
different statistical tests and logistic regression, was not efﬁcient for a
comprehensive study on a genome scale. Also, they addressed only one case
of SNP—coexpression association. Therefore, we considered the approach
introduced by Dettling e1 611. (2005), which consisted of single statistical
tests and was proven to be as powerful as logistic regression, but at the same
time the computational cost in terms of searching for differentially expressed
gene combinations were considerably low. Although Dettling et al.’s work
dealt with binary association, the three—class association problem in our SNP—
coexpression associations can be modeled by ﬁnding the best one from the
three possible binary associations.

For this study, we adopted the following convention: the correlation
between two expression proﬁles was measured by Pearson’s correlation
coefﬁcient. Given a dataset in which expression levels and genotypes are
measured at once for each individual, for a pair of expression proﬁles
E1,E2 and an SNP locus with genotypes AA, AB or BB, the genotype—
dependent correlations between E1 and E2 (the correlations based on a subset
of individuals with the same genotype) are denoted by RAA, RAB and R33,
respectively, and the overall correlations between E1 and E2 in any two of the
genotypes are denoted by RAA+AB, RAA+BB and RAB+BB. The OH/Off
model ﬁnds a maximum difference among genotype—dependent correlations,
which is calculated as

score_0 = maXURAA—RABI’

IRAA—RBBlv IRAB ‘RBB I)

The on/off model could be regarded as an alternative approach to address the
switch mechanism introduced by Kayano et 611. (2009). The gap/substitution
model tests whether the sum of genotype—dependent correlations is
signiﬁcantly higher than the overall correlation, which is calculated as

score_g = max(|RAA+RAB—01RAA+AB|,
|RAA+RBB ‘0‘RAA+BB|v
lRAB +RBB ‘0‘RAB+BB l)

where 01 is a pre—deﬁned constant. A good gap—substitution association may
be interpreted as the expression patterns of two genes are well correlated
under individual genotypes at a genomic locus, while their overall correlation
cannot be observed. In the above equations, if the frequency of a genotype is
< 10%, we only consider the interactions in the other two genotypes. In such
case, the above equations become the original forms proposed by Dettling
etal. (2005), i.e. assuming that BB is not considered,

score_0= ‘RAA—RAB‘

5001‘649 = lRAA+RAB ‘0‘RAA+AB l -
Note that rare alleles/ genotypes may also be involved in SNP—coexpression
associations. We do not consider them in the current study because of frequent
high correlations by random chance (i.e. the P—values of correlations are
relatively high due to small degrees of freedom).

2.3 Simulation study for comparing different models
for SNP—coexpression associations

Logistic regression was assumed to be a reasonable approach for
modeling differential gene expression combinations and SNP—coexpression
associations despite of heavy computational burden (Dettling e1 611., 2005;
Kayano etal., 2009). To test the effectiveness of on/off and gap/substitution
scores for modeling SNP—coexpression association, a simulation study was
carried out. Every effort was made such that the simulation scenario will
mimic the real data used in this study. The simulated data consisted of
269 individuals. SNP genotypes gj (1 <1" £269) were generated according
to a pre—deﬁned minor allele frequency (MAP) and assuming Hardy—
Weinberg equilibrium. One thousand SNP—coexpression associations and
a similar number of random SNP—expression—expression combinations were

SNP-coexpression associations

 

simulated. In a random three—way combination, because the two genes were
assumed to be not associated, their expression data were generated according
to a normal distribution with mean and variance equal to 8 [denoted by N (8,
8)]. In an SNP—coexpression association, the expression data of the ﬁrst
gene was generated from N (8, 8), whereas the expression data of second
gene were generated by multiplying the expression levels of the ﬁrst gene by
a coefﬁcient sampled from uniform distribution, U [15,15], for each one of
the three genotypes and then by adding a noise term generated from N (0,8).
Mathematically, the simulation process could be summarized as follows:

x1j~N(8,8), 1<j<269

61j~ U(—1.5,1.5), 1<j<3
611x1j+ej ifgjzAA

)6sz 612x1j+ej ifgjzAB
613x1j+ej if gj=BB

1<j<269, ej~N(O,8)

To determine a proper 01 value for gap/substitution model, three choices
including 1, 1.5 and 2 were tested. The ﬁtness of logistic regression was
evaluated using Akaike information criterion (AIC). A lower AIC indicates
better ﬁtness. For an SNP—expression—expression combination, the lowest
AIC among three possible genotype combinations was used to represent its
ﬁtness.

Ten datasets using different MAF were simulated. The receiver operating
characteristic (ROC) curves for comparing logistic regression, on/off model
and gap/substitution model are shown in Figure 1. In general, smaller
MAFs tend to result in lower performance. To show potential transition
(between bad and good performance) of ROC curves, more ﬁgures were
plotted between MAF = 0.1 and MAF = 0.3. The comparison shows that
on/off and gap/substitution models are, at least, as powerful as logistic
regression for detecting SNP—coexpression associations based on the data
in this study. When MAF < 0.15, all models perform badly (i.e. close to the
diagonal line). Thus, SNP loci with an MAF < 0.15 were removed from the
HapMap genotype data. Then the loci in complete linkage disequilibrium
were merged. The total numbers of available SNPs in the HapMap genotype
data were 407 733, 360109, 347 415, 481321 and 556 873 for CEU, CHB,
JPT, YRI and the pooled populations, respectively.

The performance of gap/substitution model is slightly affected by the
choice of 01. When MAF ranges from 0.2 to 0.275, the performance of
gap/ substitution model is comparable among different 01 values. When MAF
$0.175 and MAF >3, gap/substitution models with 01:2 and 01:1 perform
best, respectively. Dettling e1 611. (2005) suggested 0121.5 for detecting
differential gene combinations. In this simulation study, gap/substitution
model with 0121.5 is more stable across different MAFs, though not the
best at each MAF. It seems that the results of this simulation study are not
adequate for determining the best 01 value, although they generally show that
the on/off and gap/substitution models can be effective in detecting SNP—
coexpression associations. The determination of the best 01 value could be
solved in real data applications.

2.4 Computational strategy for detecting
SNP—coexpression associations

The SNP—coexpression associations were computed based on both
single populations and pooled populations. To detect SNP—coexpression
associations, any two transcripts that have the same GO terms (at
the lowest levels) were considered for the subsequent downstream
analysis. Note that extremely big GO terms (i.e. involving >900 of
the 15000 selected transcripts) were excluded. These restrictions resulted
in 3284179 combinations of two expression proﬁles (out of 15 000
expression proﬁles) that share common GO terms. For each combination
of two expression proﬁles, all available SNPs were assessed using
on/off model and gap/substitution models with 0121,15 and 2, and
the best of each were recorded. This procedure was conducted to all
single and the pooled populations, resulting in the assessment of ~1013
SNP—expression—expression combinations. The computation time on 128

dual—processor quad—core nodes (Intel Xeon, 2 GB RAM/core) was ~15 days,
compared to >1000 days if Kayano e1611.’s method were used.

As a primary method for assessing the signiﬁcance of SNP—coexpression
associations, we permuted the genotype data and repeated the above
procedure, to calculate an FDR for each potential SNP—coexpression
association. Let score_0r and score _gr and score_0p and score _gp denote
the on/off and gap/substitution scores on real genotype data and permuted
genotype data, respectively. For an on/off score )6 and a gap/substitution
score y, the FDRs can be computed according to the basic idea (Storey and

Tibshirani, 2003):

F
FDR=E[—]
s

where F is the number of false positives, and S is the total number of
associations called signiﬁcant. This formula is adapted to the following two
equations for this study:

#{score_0p,- >x, i=1,2,...,3284179}

#{score_0r,- >16, 1': 1,2, ..., 3284179}

 

and
#{score_gp,- >y, 1': 1,2, ..., 3284179}

#{score_gr,- >y, i=1,2,...,3284179}

Since the procedure for FDR estimation has the same computational needs
as the computation procedure on real genotype data, it is impractical to do
multiple permutations. However, the FDR estimation in this study should
be reliable because of the large number of permuted/uncorrelated SNP loci,
equivalent to on average 10 000 permutations at an MAF interval of 0.01.

The signiﬁcance of SNP—coexpression associations was also evaluated
based on another permutation strategy. The top 100 000 SNP—coexpression
associations based on each model were retrieved. For each of these
associations, the genotypes of the SNP were permuted 1000 times, resulting
in 1000 scores on null data. The null distribution of on/off or gap/ substitution
scores was simulated based on the 1000 permutation of top 100 000
associations, i.e. 108 null scores. The P—values for real scores were initially
estimated by the number of null scores greater than a query real score divided
by 108, and subsequently adjusted for multiple comparisons using Benj amini
and Hochberg’s method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

 

3 RESULTS

3.1 Identiﬁed SNP—coexpression associations

We ﬁrst tested whether the identiﬁed SNP—coexpression associations
are meaningful, i.e. distinguishable from those based on
permuted SNP data. Comparisons of score distributions for top
20 000 SNP—coexpression associations between real and permuted
genotype data are shown in Figure 2. In general, the distributions
of on/off scores are indistinguishable between real and permuted
genotype data, suggesting that human genome is likely to generate
random on/off SNP—coexpression associations. For all populations,
the distributions of gap/substitution scores based on real genotype
data have obvious right shifts when compared with those based
on permuted genotype data, indicating that the gap/substitution
model is more powerful in detecting SNP—coexpression associations
than the on/off model. The difference between two models may
also suggest that in human genome, the scenario where genes
show coexpression under individual genotypes but not under pooled
genotypes is more widespread than the scenario where genes switch
coexpression relations between positive and negative values under
different genotypes.

In Figure 2, it appears that the difference of gap/substitution
scores between real and permuted genotype data are generally
larger at 0121.5 than at 01 :1 or 2. Further, with an FDR threshold
of 0.1, gap/substitution model with 01:15 generated much more

SNP—coexpression associations than 01:1 or 2 (Table 1). These
analyses suggest that the gap/substitution model is more powerful
at 0121.5 than at 01:1 or 2. To provide more useful information,
we considered the SNP—coexpression associations with FDR <0.1
under the gap/ substitution model with 01 21.5 as a reasonable set of
results, including 44 769 and 50 792 SNP—coexpression associations
based on single and pooled populations, respectively.

The HapMap populations are indeed different ethnic groups. The
results suggest that SNP—coexpression associations exist both within
an ethnic group and among ethnic groups. Further, we found that
there are striking differences in the number of SNP—coexpression
associations among ethnic groups. CHB and JPT have <2000
SNP—coexpression associations, whereas CEU and YRI have 9522
and 33 346 SNP—coexpression associations, respectively. Between
ethnic groups, there may be up to ~87% common gene coexpression
relations in the SNP—coexpression associations (Table 2), indicating
that some SNP—dependent coexpression relations may be widespread
in humans. However, we found that common coexpression relations
are often associated with different loci in different ethnic groups,
reﬂecting substantial genetic variations among ethnic groups. In
addition, only ~40% coexpression relations are shared between
single and pooled populations (Table 2), suggesting that a large
number of SNP—coexpression associations can be detected only if
genetic variations are increased when different ethnic groups are
studied together.

Previous studies on associations between SNPs and expression
levels show that associated SNPs tend to be proximal (cis—)
to their respective genes (Duan at 611., 2008; Spielman at 611.,
2007; Stranger at 611., 2005; Stranger at 611., 2007a; Stranger
at 611., 2007b; Veyrieras at 611., 2008). Out of the 95 561 SNP—
coexpression associations identiﬁed in this study, 48 143 have
information of chromosomal locations according to the Ensembl
database (http://www.ensembl.org/). We found that in 47 407
(98.5%) SNP—coexpression associations, the SNPs are located
remotely from the coexpressed genes (i.e. not between 1 kb upstream
and downstream of the coexpressed genes). In addition, in 41406
(85.3%) SNP—coexpression associations, the SNPs are located on a
different chromosome from the coexpressed genes. These analyses
suggest that most of SNP—coexpression associations are trans—
associations, distinct from the case of associations between SNPs
and expression levels.

Further, we deﬁned that an SNP is related to a gene if it is
located between 1kb upstream and downstream of the gene. Out
of the 95561 SNP—coexpression associations, there were 43 924
unique associated SNPs, which were found to be related to a total
of 4644 unique genes. A GO term enrichment analysis was applied
to these SNP—related genes using Fisher’s exact test with Bonferroni
correction. The top 10 associated GO terms (not including cellular
component) are summarized in Table 3. It appears that the SNP—
related genes are more likely to be regulatory genes (i.e. genes that
regulate the activity of other genes), which are widely involved in
binding, signal transduction and transcriptional regulation.

gene symbol or reference SNP ID, which represent units of
SNP—coexpression associations. Alternatively, all the associations
can be downloaded as a plain text ﬁle. On the home page,
a quick search engine which supports keyword search and batch
search is provided. An advanced search page is also provided,
which allows the user to choose a cutoff FDR, to search by
G0 terms or to use exact search. When the user submits
a query (e.g. XP04) on the home page, a brief information
page is returned (Fig. 3), on which the icon for a particular
association can be clicked on for detailed information. On the
detailed information page (Fig. 4), three pieces of information
are provided: (i) parameters for the SNP—coexpression association,
including population, gap/substitution score, P—value, FDR and
associated G0 terms; (ii) genomic information for the three units
of the SNP—coexpression association, including positions, RefSeq
IDs and Ensembl IDs for the two transcripts, and position, function
and related gene (if the SNP is located between 1kb upstream
and downstream of a gene) for the SNP; (iii) a plot showing

3.3 A stand-alone tool for analyzing any two transcripts

In the current study, in order to make the genome—wide
SNP—coexpression association studies feasible based on our
current computational capabilities, the two transcripts of an
SNP—coexpression association were restricted to the same G0 terms.
However, we are aware that the two transcripts that are associated
with the genotypes of an SNP may belong to different G0 terms.
Thus, we provide a stand—alone program on the ‘download’ page, for
the search of associated SNPs for any two transcripts of interest. The
usage of the program is described in its incorporated manual. The
user may use the ‘download’ web page to plot an SNP—coexpression
association of interest.

4 DISCUSSION

Unlike traditional eQTL analyses, in this study, we have associated
differential coexpression relations between two genes with the
genotypes of an SNP on a genome scale. We found that most
of the associated SNPs in SNP—coexpression associations are
located remotely from the coexpressed genes, and that the SNP—
related genes are enriched with regulatory functions. A potential
mechanism underlying SNP—coexpression associations could be that

the associated SNPs affect the functions or expression of their related
genes, which are regulators of downstream coexpressed genes,
and thereby these associated SNPs could ﬁne tune coexpression
relationships between genes.

Gene expression is important for understanding the genetics of
complex diseases. This study suggests that natural variations in
human gene expression may exist in coexpression relationships.
The analysis of genetically determined variation in coexpression
relationships may enhance understanding of both the underlying
genetics and the population differences in complex diseases.

The SNPxGE2 database provides information on computationally
predicted human SNP—coexpression associations. The interfaces
of SNPxGE2 are friendly and easy to use. Biologists may
use this database to ﬁnd whether their genes of interest
have coexpressed/interacting partners associated with a particular
distribution of genotypes, and/or their potential upstream regulatory
genes, which are difﬁcult to detect using routine correlation analyses.
Biologists may also use this database to study potentially dynamic
and complex relationships among the members of a biological
process using GO term search.

SNPxGE2 is a continuing project and is expected to grow
substantially over the coming years as next—generation sequencing
technologies like Illumina, 454 Plus PacBio and Ion Torrent
have made the data generation cheaper and newer mapping
technologies will lead to enormous amounts of RNASeq data for
studying gene expression (Joseph and Read, 2010; Langmead et al.,
2010), which is quantitative enough to be included in human
SNP—coexpression association analyses. Furthermore, mapping
differential gene coexpression to more genetic features like DNA
copy numbers (generated from array CGH data) is also under
investigation and will be incorporated into SNPxGE2 in the next
release. In addition, this study establishes preliminary results for
constructing human genotype—dependent coexpression networks,
which will be carried out more extensively in the future.

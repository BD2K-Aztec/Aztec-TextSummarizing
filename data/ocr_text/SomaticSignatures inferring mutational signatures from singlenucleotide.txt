Abstract

Summary: Mutational signatures are patterns in the occurrence of somatic single—nucleotide vari—
ants that can reflect underlying mutational processes. The SomaticSignatures package provides
flexible, interoperable and easy—to—use tools that identify such signatures in cancer sequencing
data. It facilitates large—scale, cross—dataset estimation of mutational signatures, implements exist—
ing methods for pattern decomposition, supports extension through user—defined approaches and

integrates with existing Bioconductor workflows.

Availability and implementation: The R package SomaticSignatures is available as part of the
Bioconductor project. Its documentation provides additional details on the methods and demon—

strates applications to biological datasets.

1 Introduction

Mutational signatures link observed somatic single—nucleotide vari—
ants to mutation generating processes (Alexandrov et 61]., 2013a).
The identification of these signatures offers insights into the evolu—
tion, heterogeneity and developmental mechanisms of cancer
(Fischer et 61]., 2013; Alexandrov et 61]., 2013b; Nik—Zainal et 61].,
2012). Existing softwares offer specialized functionality for this ap—
proach and have contributed to the characterization of signatures in
multiple cancer types (Nik—Zainal et 61]., 2012; Fischer et 61]., 2013),
While their reliance on custom data input and output formats limits
integration into common workﬂows.

The SomaticSignatures package aims to encourage Wider adoption
of mutational signatures in tumor genome analysis by providing an ac—
cessible R implementation that supports multiple statistical approaches,
scales to large datasets and closely interacts With the data structures and
tools of Bioconductor (R Core Team, 2015; Gentleman et 61]., 2004).

2 Approach

The probability of a somatic single—nucleotide variant (SNV) to
occur can depend on the sequence neighborhood, and a fruitful ap—
proach is to analyze SNV frequencies together With their immediate
sequence context, the flanking 3’ and 5’ bases (Alexandrov et 61].,
2013b). As an example, the mutation of A to G in the sequence TAC
defines the mutational motif T[A>G]C. The occurrence patterns of
such motifs capture characteristics of mutational mechanisms, and
the frequencies of the 96 possible motifs across all samples define
the mutational spectrum. It is represented by the matrix M, with M,,-
enumerating over the motifs i and the samples 1'. The mutational
spectrum can be interpreted by decomposing M into two matrices of
smaller size (Nik-Zainal et 61]., 2012),

where the number of signatures r is typically small compared to the
number of samples, and the elements of the residual matrix 8 are
minimized such that WH is a useful approximation of the data. The
columns of W describe the composition of a signature: Wik is the
relative frequency of somatic motif 1' in the lath signature. The rows
of H indicate the contribution of each signature to a particular sam—
ple j. A primary goal of the SomaticSignatures package is the easy
application of this approach to datasets in an environment that pro—
vides users with powerful visualizations and algorithms.

3 Methods

Several approaches exist for the decomposition [Equation (1)] that
differ in their constraints and computational complexity. In principal
component analysis (PCA), for a given 1’, W and H are chosen such
that the norm 21-]- 81-2]- is minimal and W is orthonormal. Non—negative
matrix factorization (NMF) (Brunet et al., 2004) is motivated by
the fact that the mutational spectrum fulfills Mi,20 and imposes
the same requirement on the elements of W and H. Different NMF
and PCA algorithms allow additional constraints on the results,
such as sparsity. To deduce the number r of signatures present in
the data, information theoretical criteria as well as prior biological
knowledge can be employed (Nik—Zainal et al., 2012; Alexandrov
et al., 2013a).

4 Results

SomaticSignatures is a ﬂexible and efficient tool for inferring charac-
teristics of mutational mechanisms, based on the methodology de—
veloped by Nik—Zainal et al. (2012). It integrates with Bioconductor
tools for processing and annotating genomic variants. An analysis
starts with a set of SNV calls, typically imported from a VCF file
and represented as a VRanges object (Obenchain et al., 2014). Since
the original calls do not contain information about the sequence
context, we construct the mutational motifs first, based on the se—
quence of a reference or personalized genome.

ctx : mutationContext(VRanges, Genome)

Subsequently, we define the mutational spectrum M. While its
columns are by default defined by the sample labels, users can spe—
cify an alternative grouping covariate, for example tumor type.

to : motifMatrix(ctx, group)

Mutational signatures and their contribution to each sample’s
mutational spectrum are estimated with a chosen decomposition
method for a defined number of signatures. We provide convenient
access to implementations for NMF and PCA, and users can apply
functions with alternative decomposition methods through the API.

sigs : identifySignatures(m, nSig, method)

The user interface and library of plotting functions facilitate sub—
sequent analysis and presentation of results (Fig. 1). Accounting for
technical biases is often essential, particularly when analyzing across
multiple datasets. For this purpose, we provide methods to normal—
ize for the background distribution of sequence motifs and demon—
strate the adjustment for batch effects.

In the documentation of the software, we illustrate a use case by
analyzing 594 607 somatic SNV calls from 2408 TCGA whole—
exome sequenced samples (Gehring, 2014). The analysis, including
NMF, PCA and hierarchical clustering, completes within minutes on
a standard desktop computer. The different approaches yield a

Fig. 1. Analysis of mutational signatures for eight TCGA studies (Gehring,
2014). The observed mutational spectrum of each study (panel a) was decom-
posed into five distinct mutational signatures 81—85 (panel b) with NMF. The
presence of these signatures in the studies (panel c), as shown by hierarchical
clustering, underlines the similarities in mutational processes of biologically
related cancer types. An annotated high-resolution version of this figure is

to the estimated signatures (Fig. 1).

We have applied this approach to the characterization of kidney
cancer and have shown that classification of subtypes according to
mutational signatures is consistent with classification based on RNA
expression profiling and mutation rates (Durinck et al., 2015).

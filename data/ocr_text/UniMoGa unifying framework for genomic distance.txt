ABSTRACT

Summary: UniMoG is a software combining five genome rearrange-
ment models: double cut and join (DCJ), restricted DCJ, Hannenhalli
and Pevzner (HP), inversion and translocation. It can compute the
pairwise genomic distances and a corresponding optimal sorting
scenario for an arbitrary number of genomes. All five models can be
unified through the DCJ model, thus the implementation is based on
DCJ and, where reasonable, uses the most efficient existing algo-
rithms for each distance and sorting problem. Both textual and graph-
ical output is possible for visualizing the operations.

Availability and implementation: The software is available through
the Bielefeld University Bioinformatics Web Server at http://
bibiserv.techfak.uni-bielefeld.de/dcj with instructions and example
data.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome rearrangements describe the dynamics of evolution at
an abstracted genomic level, in contrast to local mutations of
single DNA base pairs. Very little is known about the exact
procedure of rearrangement events and how and when they are
triggered. More detailed knowledge of evolution could help to
improve the understanding of the mechanisms important for sur-
vival and development of species. The evolutionary distance be-
tween at least two organisms with shared gene content can be
estimated by solving the combinatorial problem of finding a pos-
sible sequence of rearrangement operations among their shared
genes under the aspect of parsimony. Thus, all genes unique to
one of the genomes are ignored and only one representative
among duplicated genes is chosen for the comparison.

In recent years, large amounts of genomic data have become
available and genome comparison has become a routine task.
For example, the Chimpanzee Sequencing and Analysis
Consortium (2005) compared chimpanzee and human genomes
and developed a catalogue of genetic differences. Since both are
closely related, only one fusion of two chromosomes and several
inversions were identified. Another example is the comparison of
human and mouse genomes by Pevzner and Tesler (2003).

Among other methods they used GRIMM (Tesler, 2002b) for
the analysis, because utilizing automated methods allows for
easier and faster analyses, no matter how divergent the investi-
gated organisms are. GRIMM is based on the Hannenhalli and
Pevzner (HP) model (Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1995), thus its set
of rearrangement operations comprises inversions, transloca-
tions, fusions and fissions of linear genomes. However, one can
investigate the phylogenetic distance under different aspects and
the HP model is only one of the common models. Besides the HP
model we consider four additional models. The inversion model
(Hannenhalli and Pevzner, 1999) allows for inversions of internal
genomic regions in linear, uni-chromosomal genomes, while the
translocation model (Hannenhalli, 1996) comprises the exchange
of two linear chromosome ends. As already mentioned, HP com-
bines both models and adds fusions and ﬁssions of two chromo-
somes to the repertoire of rearrangement operations. Among the
included models, the most general is the double cut and join
(DCJ) model (Bergeron et al. 2006b; Yancopoulos et al. 2005),
which allows for all common rearrangement operations: inver-
sions, translocations, fusions, fissions, circularizations and decir-
cularizations. Besides these operations, block interchanges,
which describe the exchange of two DNA segments, can be
mimicked through two operations by all models, except the in-
version model. Finally, the restricted DCJ model (Kovac et al.,
2011) allows the same operations as the DCJ model, but con-
stricts it by requiring immediate decircularization in the next step
for emerging circular chromosomes.

In our software, UniMoG, the DCJ Adjacency Graph data
structure (Bergeron et al., 2006b), serves as basis for all calcu-
lations, and in contrast to GRIMM it implements, based on
DCJ, all of these five distance models and is able to return
either the desired distance or the distance and a corresponding
optimal sorting scenario. For fast comparisons between the dif-
ferent distances, it is also possible to calculate all ﬁve distances
and sorting scenarios at once, if applicable. Another advantage
is that the input is neither limited to two genomes at a time nor
can genes only be represented by integers. Instead, gene names
are converted to integers for the internal representation. In the
case of multiple input genomes, all of them are compared pair-
wise with each other. The distance results are then returned in a
matrix, which is also provided in PHYLIP format (Fig. 1,
inset), and can further be fed into distance-based phylogenetic
tree reconstruction methods, possibly after applying distance

Fig. 1. Two of the three output levels of a restricted DCJ sorting scenario involving the common t-RNA genes of four yeast genomes. The circular
chromosome in step one is directly reincorporated in the next step according to the restricted DCJ definition

correction models like the ones presented by Lin and Moret
(2008).

UniMoG was implemented with a strong focus on computa-
tional efficiency. Therefore, all five distance calculations and the
DCJ sorting are carried out in linear time as explained in
Bergeron et al. (2006b), Erdos et al. (2011), Pevzner and Tesler
(2003) and Tesler (2002a). For restricted DCJ sorting, we imple-
mented the linearithmic time algorithm of Kovac et al. (2011).
The implemented translocation sorting algorithm, explained in
Bergeron et al. (2006a), was chosen even though its worst case
running time is cubic, because in practice it almost always runs
in linear time. Our implementation of the inversion sorting algo-
rithm is the sequence augmentation algorithm introduced by
Tannier et al. (2007) with a quadratic worst case running time,
based on the data structures from Bergeron et al. (2005). This
algorithm also defines the running time of the HP sorting algo-
rithm, since it uses the preprocessing explicated in Tesler (2002a)
and afterwards hands over the concatenated genomes to the in-
version sorting algorithm. Although GRIMM still contains an
error, revealed by Jean and Nikolski (2007), we use their cor-
rected capping and concatenation algorithm. Note that all of
these algorithms return only one of possibly many sorting scen-
arios. Sampling uniformly among all scenarios will be subject of
a future version of UniMoG.

Because of the efficient implementation, UniMoG can handle
large genomes and was tested with genomes up to 32 500 genes
without encountering any problems. For further improvement of
the computational performance, regions with identical gene
order can be merged into larger synteny blocks, since none of
the considered models can break up conserved blocks.

For an intuitive handling, the output of UniMoG is divided
into three levels (Fig. 1): first, the graphical output is designed for
closely studying the rearrangement scenarios, highlighting each
performed operation and allowing three different zoom levels.
Furthermore, when color mode is active, each chromosome is
assigned a unique color for easier analysis of large genomes.
Second, an optimal sorting scenario is returned in text format,
which allows for easy reuse of intermediate genomes. Finally, the
results are also returned as a list of adjacencies of each intermedi-
ate genome. The integrated save functions allow quick saving of
graphical or textual output data.

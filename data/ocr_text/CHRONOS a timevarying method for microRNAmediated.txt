Abstract

Motivation: In the era of network medicine and the rapid growth of paired time series mRNA/
microRNA expression experiments, there is an urgent need for pathway enrichment analysis meth—
ods able to capture the time— and condition—specific ‘active parts’ of the biological circuitry as well
as the microRNA impact. Current methods ignore the multiple dynamical ‘themes’—in the form of
enriched biologically relevant microRNA—mediated subpathways—that determine the functionality
of signaling networks across time.

Results: To address these challenges, we developed time—vaRying enriCHment integrOmics
Subpathway aNalysis tOol (CHRONOS) by integrating time series mRNA/microRNA expression
data with KEGG pathway maps and microRNA—target interactions. Specifically, microRNA—
mediated subpathway topologies are extracted and evaluated based on the temporal transition
and the fold change activity of the linked genes/microRNAs. Further, we provide measures that
capture the structural and functional features of subpathways in relation to the complete organism
pathway atlas. Our application to synthetic and real data shows that CHRONOS outperforms cur—
rent subpathway—based methods into unraveling the inherent dynamic properties of pathways.

1 Introduction

 

In the last decade, pathway—based approaches have become the first
choice in complex disease analysis for gaining more delicate biolo—
gical insights and have enabled the comprehension of the higher-
order functions of the biological systems (Khatri et 61]., 2012). In
parallel, the increasing number of time course experiments has
opened new avenues for pathway analysis to unravel the dynamic

features of the interdependencies among a cell’s molecular compo—
nents leading to deeper characterization of the functional, molecular
and causal relationships among apparently distinct phenotypes
(Barabasi et 61]., 2011). Toward this direction, few approaches have
considered the dynamic aspects of pathways (Khatri et 61]., 2012)
and, to our knowledge, no method has been developed to deal with
their context—dependent and systematic temporal variations.

The first generation of pathway—based approaches related expres—
sion data to pathways by examining the entire pathway and well-
established methods in this category are GSEA (Subramanian et 61].,
2005) and SPIA (Tarca et 61]., 2009). The next generation shifted the
focus toward subpathways (local areas of the entire biological path-
way), which represent the underlying biological phenomena more
accurately, and have emerged as even more targeted and context—
specific molecular candidate communities for the treatment of com—
plex diseases (Chen et 61]., 2011; Haynes et 61]., 2013; Jacob et 61].,
2012; Li et 51]., 2012a, 2015; Martini et 61]., 2013; Nam et 61]., 2014;
Sebastian—Leon et 61]., 2014). A representative example is the
Subpathway—GM method which identifies key metabolic subpathways
based on information from genes and metabolites by searching for
similarities of signature nodes within the pathway structure (Li et 61].,
2013). Another relevant method is the topology enrichment analysis
framework (TEAK) (Judeh et 61]., 2013) which extracts linear and
non—linear subpathways and scores them using the Bayes Net Toolbox
to fit a context—specific Gaussian Bayesian network for each subpath—
way. However, these approaches do not take the temporal aspects of
pathways into consideration and ignore possible perturbations on
intermediate time points. Moving forward, timeClip combines dimen—
sion reduction techniques and graph decomposition theory to explore
and identify the portion of pathways that is mostly time—dependent
(Martini et 61]., 2014). Although the temporal variation of the path—
way is explored so as to identify the most time—dependent subpath—
way, information about the regulation between nodes is not included
and the exact time period a subpathway is active is not provided.

In parallel, nowadays genome—wide expression studies of the en—
dogenous non—coding small RNAs (microRNAs) have given a strong
impulse to the comprehension of cell regulatory mechanisms
(Calura et 61]., 2014; Dimitrakopoulou et 61]., 2015). Recent studies
have examined the microRNA (miRNA) regulation upon pathways
by showing that the perturbations on pathways does not necessarily
occur at the overall level but more likely at specific areas of the top—
ology (subpathways) (Li et 61]., 2012b, 2014; Ooi et 61]., 2011; Wu
et 61]., 2013; Zhang et 61]., 2014).

Toward addressing these challenges, we introduce the time—
vaRying enriCHment integrOmics Subpathway aNalysis tOol
(CHRONOS) which detects significantly enriched miRNA—mediated
subpathways per time point from paired miRNNmRNA time series
expression profiles (Fig. 1). Our key assumption is that during the
time course, different subareas of the pathway topology are active
and the transitions of subpathway activity at time t depend solely on
time t — 1 (Jethava et 61]., 2011). We illustrate the enhanced per—
formance of CHRONOS over other state—of—the—art subpathway—
based methods based on synthetic time series expression data.
Finally, we evaluate our method on a publicly available time series
microarray dataset (Nazarov et 61]., 2013) which investigates the
transcriptional changes of miRNA and mRNA expression levels
over time after activation of the Janus kinase/Signal transducer and
activator of transcription (Jak/STAT) pathway by interferon-gamma
stimulation (IFN—g) of melanoma cells. Our results show how time—
evolving subpathway analysis generates new robust and dynamically
context—rich biological hypotheses that complement those generated
by other classical bioinformatics pipelines.

on user's data input, i.e. paired time series mRNA and miRNA expression

tion imposed by the pathway topology. (E) The top-scoring subpathways can
be further examined for enrichment in any user-defined set of ‘interesting
genes' based on cumulative hypergeometric distribution. Information regard-
ing structural and functional aspects of subpathways is provided via three
subpathway-adapted graph-based measures: the subpathway degree
(subDEG), the betweenness centrality (subBC) and the subPathness

case only the mRNA expression data are available. Twelve common
gene label systems are supported, such as EntrezGene ID, UniGene
ID, Refseq mRNA ID, HGNC ID, Ensembl Gene ID, based on the
web—based data mining tool BioMart (Durinck et 61]., 2005). Also,

mature miRNA Ids as reference are obtained by miRBase database
(http://www.mirbase.org/) (Supplementary text 1). We denote that
the terms ‘gene’, ‘mRNA’ and their encoded ‘protein’ are used inter—
changeably in this article.

2.1.2 Data retrieval

All available organism—specific pathway maps, both metabolic and
non—metabolic, are downloaded from KEGG pathway database
(Kanehisa et al., 2002). miRNA—mRNA interactions (micronome)
are downloaded from miRecords (Xiao et al., 2009) which inte—
grates the predicted targets of eleven established miRNA target pre—
diction tools (Supplementary text 2). Validated interactions are
downloaded from miRecords and DIANA—TarBase (Vlachos et al.,
2015

2.1.3 Converting pathways to gene—gene networks

All KEGG metabolic and non—metabolic pathways are converted to
directed gene—gene networks based on information in KGML files
(Supplementary text 3 and Fig. S1), without compromising the
structural topology of the pathway. In parallel, the biological as—
sumptions set prior to conversion can be adapted according to the
study under investigation; similar tools lack such flexibility.

KEGG pathway entry elements representing genes (type : ‘gene’)
may correspond to single or multiple gene products containing most
likely gene families or genes with similar biochemical function.
Similarly, entries named ‘group’ usually include multiple gene prod—
ucts representing protein complexes. To tackle this, these entries are
expanded into separate nodes by rewiring the incoming and outgo—
ing links of the entry (Supplementary Fig. S2) (Sales et al., 2012).
Optionally, these entries can be considered (user—defined) as single
nodes by unifying the corresponding gene products for downstream
analysis (Judeh et al., 2013). The chemical compounds (type : ‘com—
pound’) are omitted from the graph and the pathway structure is
preserved by connecting the nodes in cases a compound (or hash of
compounds) acts as a bridge in—between (Supplementary Fig. S3) (Li
et al., 2013).

Another major issue is the categorization of the multiple KEGG
supported relations among entries with regard to their biological in-
terpretation. We define three kinds of relations; ‘activation’ is trans—
lated as enhancement of gene regulation, ‘inbibition’ as suppression
and ‘unknown’ with ambiguous definition. Of note, the user can de—
fine a fourth kind of relation named ‘no interaction’ so as to exclude
specific relation types while focus on those of interest. In addition,
CHRONOS allows the user to define the single/multiple relation
types and directionality that characterizes an interaction
(Supplementary Table S1). Also, with regard to metabolic pathways,
gene—gene relations are constructed either by accounting all en—
zyme—enzyme (typez‘ECrel’) relations (Judeh et al., 2013) or/and
by extracting all metabolites participating in reactions as substrate
or product (Li et al., 2013) (Supplementary text 3 and Fig. S4). An
indicative example about pathways conversion to gene—gene net—
work is provided in Supplementary Figure S5.

2.1.4 miRNA-mediated subpathway extraction

Linear and non—linear subpathways are extracted from the gene—
gene pathway network. The former are comprised of genes in linear
cascades with an in—house computationally fast approach
(Supplementary text 4), while the latter contain highly connected
gene communities. Notably, our extraction process is highly advan—
tageous over other similar methods in terms of capturing into sub—
pathways the maximum number of nodes present in the KEGG

pathway maps (called hereafter ‘node coverage’) (Fig. 2A and
Supplementary Fig. S21).

As linear subpathways, we consider all ordered linear sequences
of gene interactions from biologically meaningful start—nodes to
end—nodes. In this case, the start—nodes have no incoming inter-
actions and the end—nodes have no outgoing interactions. For a given
gene—gene pathway network, the subpathways are obtained by
searching all possible paths between start—nodes and end—nodes
(Supplementary text 4 and Figs. S6—SS).

Regarding non—linear subpathways, the biological assumption is
that the functional similarity between two genes increases as their
distance in pathways decreases (Guo et al., 2006). Under this notion,
we aim to find subpathways in which all genes have a neighbor with
a common functional role. For this, we detect non—linear subpath—
ways at each pathway map by adopting the k—clique concept used in
social network analysis (Li et al., 2009). A k—clique is a subgraph
where the distance between any two nodes is no greater than k. In
our default settings, every 2—clique is a non—linear subpathway
(Supplementary text 5 and Figs. S9—S11).

The micronome layer above each subpathway is constructed
based on miRecords and TarBase by searching for miRNAs target-
ing the respective gene members. A miRNA is considered as a poten—
tial regulator of a subpathway if its targets are significantly enriched
in the relevant subpathway members. Enrichment analysis is per—
formed based on cumulative hypergeometric distribution:

(ENE?) (1)

(z )

where we suppose that the user input list has G genes, and 1 genes

d
P = 1 —

x=0
are included in the subpathway. D is the number of the miRNA tar-
get genes and d those included in the subpathway (Li et al., 2012b).
miRNAs with P < 0.05 are regarded as candidate regulators. The
final miRNA regulators of a subpathway are defined later during
scoring process (see later Section 2.1.6).

2.1.5 Interactivity scoring schemes

The core component of CHRONOS is two scoring schemes which
manage, first on interaction and later on pathway level, to encapsu—
late the fold changes in expression and the temporal aspects at the
level of interactions as well as the ﬂow of information imposed by
the pathway topology.

The change in the expression level of a gene is adequately con—
trolled by measuring its fold change activity (relative to a control
condition). Under the perspective of pathway networks, it is cru—
cial to examine fold change in expression at the level of edges
when referring to interacting genes. To accomplish this, CHRONOS
uses the Fold Change Interactivity (FCI) score [Equation (2)]
based on two multivariate logistic functions, which capture pairs of
nodes with high absolute fold change values and with high positive
or negative correlation (Kim et al., 2011). The fold activity score
of the corresponding interaction 6 at time t for two connected
nodes i,j is:

k:i,j6e k:i.i€e

(2)

where ff and fit are the logZ—fold change values of nodes i and 1', re—
spectively. C, K denote the parameters controlling the shape of the
multivariate logistic distribution, and T is a shifting parameter. An
indicative example of FCI score is provided in Supplementary Figure
S12. Over the course of the activation of a pathway there exist

human (hsa) KEGG pathway maps. (B) Illustration of subPathness functional measure. P1, P2 and P3 are three hypothetical pathways with each node denoting a
gene and S is a subpathway with four nodes all shared among the three pathways. 8 is considered as a subpathway with high subPathness value. (C)
(Simulation analysis) Four expression patterns, based on different types of regulation, were assigned to the nodes of the gene—gene network descending from
the human KEGG metabolic pathway maps. (D) Boxplot depicting the F1-score results of CHRONOS, TEAK, timeClip, Subpathway-GM and DEAP based on syn-
thetic data. All tools were applied on 100 independent synthetic network models for each duration period of regulation (in all time points, in early/late time points,
in one time point). CHRONOS outperforms the other tools in all cases with statistical significance (two-sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, P-value< 0.01). (E)
(Application to real expression data) The number of enriched non-metabolic subpathways with subscore > 0.4 in each time point and q—value < 0.05 is shown.
With rhomb, we refer to all enriched subpathways and with square to the subset that is regulated by at least one miRNA. The maximum number of (miRNA-medi-
ated) subpathways was observed at time 48 h. (F) (Application to real expression data) Bar plots visualizing per time point the percentage of enriched non-meta-
bolic subpathways that belong to the top scoring 25% (of the total pool of subpathways) with regard to the structural and functional measures (subDEG, subBC,
subPathness). As shown, the majority of enriched subpathways displayed at 48 h the highest value in all three metrics

multiple time—varying topological ‘themes’, i.e. time—/condition—
specific enriched biologically relevant subgraphs, that determine the
output of the topology (Martini et al., 2014; Song et al., 2009).
Under this notion, we employed a model rooted in Markov dy—
namics for analyzing the interactivity dynamics among nodes based
on the dynamics of their expression changes (Jethava et al., 2011).
To accomplish this, we introduce the Time—Varying Interactivity
(TVI) score arising from a probabilistic generative model.

Initially, we define the pathway interaction graph with V nodes
(genes) and E edges (interactions) as G = (V, xf, is the fold
change expression level for gene 11 E V at time t and w: is the inter-
action strength of e E E at time t. Weight w can take values in the
range w : {—2, —1,0, 1,2} and represents the interaction strength
and higher values correspond to increasing degrees of positive cor—
relation of the interacting genes. The probability of the fold change
expression levels for genes i and j at time t , conditioned on the inter—
action strength w: , is calculated as:

—>t _.t —>t _)t 1
P(X =95 IW = “UZﬁexP Z  7 (3)
Z
_.t . . . .
where Z(w) IS the normalization constant. It IS assumed that
the weights evolve according to the Markov property, thus the

. . . .  . —)t
probability of the tran51tion from state w at time t — 1 to state w
at time t is:

 

_ —>t—1 _ —>t—1 _
Q07)“ Dab") : 1 exp 2  P(X :E‘t 1|W : i7)" 1)
Z

—>t

(w ) e:(i,i)EE

From the earlier equations, we obtain the TVI: score for each inter—
action e E E at each time t which is TVI: :maxw Q(i_t‘1t_1,i_t‘/t)
(Supplementary text 6). Interactions with TVI: : {—2, 0,2} indicate
that the fold changes of the corresponding genes of interaction e at
time t — 1 and t, are strongly negatively correlated, uncorrelated and
strongly positively correlated, respectively. Similarly, interactions
with TVI: : {—1,1} indicate weak negative and weak positive cor—
relation, respectively.

The two aforementioned scoring schemes are unified into the
Interactivity Score (IS) after accounting for the KEGG pathway
interaction trends. More specifically, we defined two consecutive
criteria before unifying FCI and TVI scores. First, we check if the
two scores agree in terms of sign. Second, if the first criterion is ful-
filled, we check if the interaction trend sign [(+) for ‘activation’ and
(—) for ‘inhibition’] agrees with the sign of the scores. In case of
agreement, the two scores are added multiplied by two weighting

factors [e.g. IF FCI > 0 AND TVI > 0 AND interaction trend > 0
THEN IS is calculated based on Equation (5)]; in case the first and/
or second criterion is not fulfilled the IS is set to zero (e.g. IF FCI
< 0AND TVI > OTHENIS: 0,IFFCI < 0AND TVI< 0ANDi
nteraction trend > 0 THEN IS = 0). Notably, in the case of ‘un—
known’ interactions, the second criterion is not checked since the
interaction trend cannot be unambiguously determined.
For interaction e at time t, IS is calculated as:

15:24. |TVI§|+b-|FCI;| , (5)

where a,b are weighting parameters indicating the percentage of
contribution of TVI and FCI score, respectively. With these criteria,
we promote, first on interaction and later on pathway level, the
interactions among nodes that simultaneously change in terms of ex—
pression in each time point and these changes accord well with the
constraints imposed by the topology.

miRNA-gene interactions are also examined in similar manner
[Equation (5 )] as previous to identify miRNAs correlated to their
target genes (Ooi et al., 2011) during time. Notably, for these inter—
actions the type of relation is not well—defined since, according to lit—
erature evidence, miRNAs mainly exhibit suppression effect but in
many cases can also exhibit activation effect (Place et al., 2008). For
this reason, we selected to ignore the type of relation to avoid bias—
ing the scoring process in favor of the suppressor type of relation.

2.1.6 Time-varying enriched miRNA-mediated subpathways
Moving forward from interaction to pathway level, subpathways
are evaluated based on the IS since we search for simultaneously
context— and time—specific subpathways, whose expression changes
in specific time points accord well with the flow of information
as provided by the subpathway structure. Hence, subpathway score
(subscore) is calculated as the summand of all involved ISs divided
with the number of subpathway interactions, so that the scores
among subpathways are comparable. For a subpathway with N
gene members and N — 1 interactions at time t, subscore is:
N—1

IS:

621

N—1’

 

subscore“) : (6)
where IS: is the Interactivity Score of interaction e at time t.
Further, via cumulative hypergeometric distribution the enrichment
of a subpathway in any user—defined set of ‘interesting genes’ (e.g.
list of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), list of disease—related
genes, etc.) can be examined. In detail, the statistical significance is
calculated based on Equation (1) where G is the user—defined gene
set, D the number of user—defined set of interesting genes, 1 all the
genes involved in the subpathway and d the interesting genes
included in the subpathway. Also, the false positive (FP) discovery
rate of P results is reduced by providing false discovery rate (FDR)
corrected P—values (q—values). Subpathways with subscore > 0.4 in
at least one time point and q-z/alue < 0.05 (in case a set of ‘interest—
ing genes’ is provided) are considered enriched. The subscore thresh—
old was determined by setting a FDR of 1% cutoff on the results
derived from 100 permutations; in each permutation a small frac—
tion of subpathway interaction scores changed and subpathway
scores were recomputed (Allantaz et al., 2012).

Similarly, for the micronome layer, the involved candidate inter—
actions are evaluated based on Equation (5) and the miRNAs whose
relevant interactions achieve IS > 0.4 are considered as final regula-
tors. This threshold (0.4) was determined by setting a FDR cutoff of
1% on the results derived from 100 permutations; in each permutation

a small fraction of miRNA—mRNA interaction scores within the boun—
daries of a subpathway changed and average scores were recomputed.

2.1.7 Subpathway structural and functional measures

CHRONOS accounts for the interpathway dependencies and as
such provides information about the position of the subpathways in
the complete pathway atlas. This zoom—out overview of subpath—
ways can assist significantly when the goal is the monitoring of the
signal propagation. In our tool, subpathways are considered as sin—
gle nodes, called meta—nodes, upon which known established topo—
logical metrics are adapted. In detail, we calculate the subpathway
degree (subDEG) and betweenness centrality (subB C) so as to cap—
ture the local and global structural aspects of each subpathway, re—
spectively (Supplementary Fig. S13).

Moving forward, it is crucial to examine the functional aspects of
pathway topologies. When dealing with the organism map, it is prefer-
able to view pathways as modules defined not only through structural
measures but also through biological criteria that discriminate the mech-
anisms among pathways. Under this notion, we introduce subPathness
(Fig. 2B) which measures the degree to which a subpathway serves as
bridge (Dimitrakopoulou et al., 2014; Kovacs et al., 2010) among the
different pathways of an organism (Supplementary text 7).

2.1.8 CHRONOS output

CHRONOS is a computationally fast approach (Supplementary Fig.
S15) and outputs a ranked summary of the final results. The
(miRNA—mediated) subpathways are exported in serial alignment
based on their subscore [Equation (5 )] and FDR corrected P—values
(q—values). The (miRNA—mediated) subpathways per time point are
exported separately for each type of pathways (metabolic and non—
metabolic) and for each type of extraction (linear and non-linear)
accompanied by the graph—based metric values (subDEG, subBC,
subPathness). KEGG pathway map links and circular plots (Gu
et al., 2014) are also available for each subpathway per each time
point (Supplementary Figs. 816—819).

2.2 Generating synthetic networks and synthetic
expression data

Synthetic networks and synthetic expression data were generated to
run a simulation performance analysis of CHRONOS and other
similar tools (Section 3.1). Random graphs were generated as biolo—
gical pathway networks by using two closely related model graphs,
the Erdos—Rényi and Edgar Gilbert. These graphs were built with
N = 500 nodes with rewiring probability P = 0.9.

Synthetic gene expression values per time point were generated
either with time—dependent up/down regulation or with no change
over time relevant to a control state (logZ—fold change difference 1,
—1 and 0, respectively). In addition, the up/down regulated expres—
sion profiles were categorized according to the duration of their
regulation. These categories correspond to the up/down regulated
gene expressions in (i) all time points, in (ii) half time points (early
or late) and in (iii) one time point. For each category, a synthetic net—
work model was constructed with 60% of nodes set as up/down
regulated and the rest as non—regulated. Nodes were randomly
drawn from a normal distribution and Gaussian noise with zero
mean and standard deviation (SD = 0.2) was added.

2.3 mRNA/miRNA time series expression data of
lFN—g—treated melanoma cells

We applied CHRONOS on two real time series mRNA and miRNA
datasets after stimulation of human A375 melanoma cell line with

IFN—g (Nazarov et al., 2013). The datasets contain samples either
left untreated (control) or stimulated with human IFN—g at specific
time points. Datasets are available at ArrayExpress (www.ebi.ac.uk/
arrayexpress) under accession numbers E-MEXP-3544 and E-MEXP-
3720, respectively. The datasets were normalized with the Robust
Multi—array Average (RMA) method in MATLAB environment and
probes referring to the same Entrez Id were averaged. Also, 6,777
Entrez Ids were mapped onto KEGG human pathways (accessed May
2015) and 4048 onto our extracted subpathways. For downstream
analysis, only the matching samples among mRNA and miRNA were
kept, i.e. 0, 3, 12, 24, 48 and 72h (the Janus kinase inhibitor I second
control samples were excluded). Also, limma R package (Smyth,
2005) was used to identify significantly (with FDR < 0.05) DEGs and
miRNAs (DEMs) by comparing in each time point the expression of
IFN—g—treated samples versus untreated controls; the DEMs common
with those identified in (Nazarov et al., 2013), were used as input to
CHRONOS. Of note, CHRONOS was run including all genes
mapped to KEGG pathways and to alleviate a more comprehensive
evaluation of our results relative to the results of the original study
(Nazarov et al., 2013), the CHRONOS output subpathways were
examined for enrichment in DEGs (used as ‘interesting genes’ for the
calculation of q—values) so as to obtain those subpathways that are
most relevant.

3 Results and discussion

3.1 Application of CHRONOS to synthetic dataset

The performance of CHRONOS in capturing the time—varying
‘themes’ underlying the pathway topology was evaluated relative to
other similar methods (TEAK, timeClip, Subpathway—GM and
DEAP) based on a synthetic dataset. Figure 2C illustrates four ex—
pression patterns assigned to the nodes of a gene—gene network des—
cending from the human KEGG metabolic pathway maps (non—
metabolic pathways and miRNAs were not included since their ana—
lysis is not applicable in all methods). All tools were applied on 100
independent synthetic network models and the 100 top ranking sub—
pathways were considered as reliable for downstream analysis. To
overcome the different subpathway topologies identified by each
method, we assessed the performance (precision, recall, F1-score)
based solely on the unique nodes included in the 100 top ranking
subpathways. The up—/downregulated and non—regulated genes
included in final results were defined as true positives and FPs, re—
spectively. As false negatives were defined the up—/downregulated
genes belonging to the corresponding perturbed pathways which
were not included in the final subpathways. The boxplots of Figure
2D (see also Supplementary Fig. S20) illustrate that CHRONOS
outperformed TEAK, timeClip, Subpathway-GM and DEAP in all
types of regulation with statistical significance (two—sided Wilcoxon
signed rank test, P—z/alue < 0.01) with the highest efficiency achieved
in the one time point regulation case. These observations point out
that CHRONOS succeeds into realizing the main goal of a time ser-
ies experiment, that is to zoom into the time—specific phenomena of
a pathway (Song et al., 2009) that are not attainable using current
subpathway—based approaches.

An important feature in subpathway analysis is the ability to ex—
ploit the maximum number of nodes present in pathway maps
(‘node coverage’). We chose to test CHRONOS subpathway extrac—
tion efficiency only against TEAK and Subpathway—GM since these
two methods provide both an approach for converting KEGG
KGML pathway files into biologically concise gene—gene networks
and an approach for subpathway extraction. The node coverage in
the extracted subpathways was examined in both real and synthetic

networks based on the human KEGG pathway maps and Erdos—
Renyi and Edgar Gilbert model graphs, respectively. CHRONOS
outperformed the other two approaches both in real (Fig. 2A) as
well as in synthetic networks (Supplementary Fig. S21) with statis—
tical significance (two—sided Wilcoxon signed rank test, P—
value < 0.01).

3.2 Application of CHRONOS to real data

IFN-g production is highly related with tumor progression and prog—
nosis and IFN—g is the most important endogenous mediator of im—
munity and inflammation and plays a key role in macrophage
activation, inflammation, host defense against intracellular patho—
gens and T helper 1 cell responses (Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009). IFN—g,
apart from activating the Jak—STAT pathway, has been shown to
cross—regulate multiple signaling pathways driven by endogenous
or exogenous factors. Moreover, several miRNAs were found to
be dynamically regulated after stimulation with IFN—g (Schmitt
et al., 2012). In general, our time—varying analysis showed signifi-
cant reranking of subpathways during time evolution and in
Supplementary files S2—S5 we provide the full list of the enriched
(miRNA-mediated)—subpathways (subscore > 0.4 and q-z/alue < 0.05)
per time point. In Figure 2E, the timeline of (miRNA-mediated) non-
metabolic subpathway frequency distribution points out 48 h as the
peak of activity (see also Supplementary Fig. S24); this observation
agrees with the findings of the original study where no significant al-
teration of the mRNA levels was observed after 48h although this
analysis differs conceptually from our approach; it is focused mainly
on differentially expressed molecules and evaluates them through
functional, pathway, upstream regulator analysis and regulatory loop
identification (Nazarov et al., 2013).

Moreover, when evaluating the subpathways in terms of the
structural and functional measures (subDEG, subB C, subPathness),
we observed that at 48 h (Fig. 2F) the majority of enriched subpath-
ways acquired high scores indicating so that at this time point sev—
eral hub— and bridges—subpathways take over that in turn propagate
and scatter quickly the signal to multiple signaling pathways (see
also Supplementary Figs. S14, S22 and S25). Regarding Jak-STAT
signaling, we observed that the related subpathways (in all time
points) represent the 10.5% of all enriched non—metabolic subpath—
ways with the majority being active at 3 and 12 h, in accordance
with the observations of the original study, with most subpathways
regulated at 3h by miR—105 (other regulators: miR-18a, miR-19b,
miR-149, miR-29a). In parallel, we run TEAK, timeClip,
Subpathway—GM and DEAP on the gene expression data and com—
pared Jak—STAT and other indicative pathways whose timeline is
discussed in (Nazarov et al., 2013) and verified that CHRONOS is
efficient not only in capturing more information about the active
pathways but also in specifying the exact time period of activity (sup
plementary Table S3).

To illustrate the performance of CHRONOS into capturing
time—specific enriched topological ‘themes’, which in other case
would be neglected or implicated in the whole time period by other
current similar methods, we selected few indicative non—metabolic
exemplar pathways that underwent severe transformations in re—
sponse to IFN—g during time course. Toll-like receptor signaling
related subpathways were not active at 72 h; it has been shown that
IFN-g enhances TLR—activated signaling, promotes NF—kB activa—
tion and induces transcription factors necessary for the expression
of TLR-responsive genes (Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009). Also, most of the
TNF—signaling related subpathways were enriched at 24 h and no ac—
tive subpathway was found at 72 h; evidence has showed that IFN—g
and TNF—oc synergistically induce mesenchymal stem cell impairment

and tumorigenesis via NFKB signaling (Wang et al., 2013). RIG—I
and Ras signaling related subpathways vanished at 24 h; induction
of RIG—I in response to IFN—g was found in epithelial cell lines
(Imaizumi et al., 2005) while the signaling initiated by activated
k—ras affects the IFN/STAT signaling pathway and controls the re—
sponsiveness of cancer cells to interferons (Klampfer et al., 2003).
Finally, TGF-beta signaling related subpathways appeared only at
48 h; evidence has shown that IFN—g induces expression of SMAD7
which in turn inhibits the TGF—b—induced activation of the activating
Smad3 and of TGF—b—responsive genes (Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009).
Similarly, we observed significant temporal transformations in the
micronome layer with many miRNAs appearing or disappearing as
regulators of the active subpathways. Based on the circular plots of
Figure 3, we argue that the miRNA effect is present from the early
time point (3 h) compared with the observations of the initial study
where miRNAs are mostly involved in later time points (Nazarov
et al., 2013); however, it is evident that the regulatory effect is con—
centrated on specific pathways at the early time points whereas at
48h is scattered upon multiple pathways—probably through the
hub—/bridge—subpathways (for the remaining time points see also
Supplementary Fig. S23).

CHRONOS has the explanatory power to offer focused serial
temporal snapshots of the mechanisms perturbed under specific con—
ditions with resolution up to every single time point and offers a hol—
istic view of the dynamics of molecules participating in multiple
subpathways and in many cases multiple pathways. We comment on
the signaling neighborhood around indicative interesting genes
involved in biological functions highly related to the mechanisms
investigated in this experiment (cell adhesion, apoptosis, immune re—
sponse and cell cycle) which were described by transcriptional regu—
latory network motifs consisting of feed forward loops (FFLs)
involving transcription factors, miRNAs and joint targets (Nazarov
et al., 2013). Intercellular adhesion Molecule 1 (I CAMI) was found
in subpathways belonging to ‘leukocyte transendothelial migration’

and ‘cell adhesion molecules’ pathways with the majority being ac—
tive at 12 and 24 h and few of them under miRNA control at 12 and
48 h (time point 24h was observed in the initial study); IFN—g has
been shown to facilitate lymphocyte adhesion to endothelial junc—
tional regions enabling so the transendothelial migration (Jaczewska
et al., 2014). RelA/NF-kB complex acts as transcription factor and
it was found in subpathways descending from 16 distinct pathway
maps with most activity observed at 3, 12 and 48h and miRNA
regulation at 24 h (time point 24 h was observed in the initial study).
TP53 (tumor protein 53) acts as transcription factor and it was
found in the subpathways descending from eight pathway maps
with most activity and miRNA regulation observed at 48h (time
point 48 h was also observed in the initial study). One indicative ex—
emplar pathway involving this gene is ‘MAPK signaling’; IFN-g con-
trols tissue damage by deflating MAPK pathways that enhance the
transcriptional activity of AP—1 proteins essential for the expression
of matrix metalloproteinases whose inhibition limits tissue destruc—
tion (Hu and Ivashkiv, 2009). BCLZLI (Bcl-2-like protein 1) was
found in the subpathways descending from four pathway maps
(mostly in Jak-STAT signaling) with most activity and miRNA regu—
lation observed at 3 and 12 h (time points 48 and 72 h were observed
in the initial study). CCND1 (cyclin D1) was found in the subpath—
ways descending from 13 pathway maps, mainly in prolactin, Jak-
STAT and focal adhesion signaling, with most activity and miRNA
regulation observed at 48 h (time point 72 h was observed in the ini—
tial study). The discrepancies between methods are explained by the
limitation of KEGG topology in terms of the number of pathway
annotated genes and by the fact that only differentially expressed
molecules are used in (Nazarov et al., 2013) and the inferred tran—
scriptional regulatory network motifs are related to signaling path—
ways but the latter refer mostly to the targets of FFLs. As such, our
method is complementary and can serve as a push forward step for
unraveling more about the dynamics of ‘crossroad’ molecules
involved in many cases in multiple downstream signal propagation

routes not only under the umbrella of gross signaling pathways—
with unclear in many cases definitions and boundaries—but on the
more finite context—rich scale of subpathways.

4 Conclusion

CHRONOS is a computationally fast and efficient approach for
scanning the complete pathway topology to track the time—/context—
specific biologically enriched subpathways along with their time—/
context—specific miRNA regulators. The method and the supporting
R package are flexible by allowing the user to intervene and adapt
all discrete phases to the needs of the study under investigation.
CHRONOS can assist significantly in complex disease analysis by
enabling the experimentalists to acquire a more realistic time—vary—
ing dynamical view of the involved perturbed mechanisms.

Abstract

Motivation: Most computational tools for small non—coding RNAs (sRNA) sequencing data analysis
focus in microRNAs (miRNAs), overlooking other types of sRNAs that show multi—mapping hits.
Here, we have developed a pipeline to non—redundantly quantify all types of sRNAs, and extract
patterns of expression in biologically defined groups. We have used our tool to characterize and
profile sRNAs in post—mortem brain samples of control individuals and Parkinson’s disease (PD)
cases at early—premotor and late—symptomatic stages.

Results: Clusters of co—expressed sRNAs mapping onto tRNAs significantly separated premotor
and motor cases from controls. A similar result was obtained using a matrix of miRNAs slightly
varying in sequence (isomiRs). The present framework revealed sRNA alterations at premotor
stages of PD, which might reflect initial pathogenic perturbations. This tool may be useful to
discover sRNA expression patterns linked to different biological conditions.

1 Introduction

 

RNA high-throughput sequencing strategies have revealed a pleth—
ora of small non—coding RNAs (sRNAs) With diverse functions as
regulators of gene expression (Esteller, 2011). While micro RNAs
(miRNAs) are the best—known class of sRNAs, for many others the
biogenesis, regulation and cellular roles are largely unknown.

Accumulating evidence suggests that RNA fragments derived from
small nucleolar RNA (snoRNA) and transfer RNA (tRNA) are not
just random degradation products but rather stable elements, which
may have functional activity in physiological and pathological con—
ditions, inﬂuencing gene expression and alternative splicing events
(Martens—Uzunova et 61]., 2013). In neuronal cells, tRNA fragments

sensitize cells to oxidative—stress—induced p53 activation and p53—
dependent cell death indicating that these sRNAs may participate in
neurodegenerative processes (Hanada et al., 2013).

In the central nervous system (CNS), miRNA are essential in
cell—type specification and differentiation, and post—mitotic long—
term neuronal maintenance. Perturbations of miRNA pathways
have emerged as effectors of CNS damage, contributing to impaired
cell homeostasis and neuronal death. However, the relevance of
other types of sRNAs in analogous processes has been little
explored, constituting an untapped source of bioactive compounds.
Several miRNAs pathways are altered in neurodegenerative dis—
orders, including Parkinson’s disease (PD), the most common move—
ment disorder (de Rijk et al., 2000; Shulman et al., 2011). We have
previously shown that the expression of several miRNAs is altered
in brains of patients at early/premotor and late/motor stages of PD
(Minones—Moyano et al., 2011, 2013). These miRNAs modulate
mitochondrial function and neuronal viability, suggesting a contri—
bution of their deregulation in early pathogenic events. In addition,
miRNA profiling in peripheral blood suggests specific expression
signatures in PD (Burgos et al., 2014; Fernandez—Santiago et al.,
2015). Furthermore, in leukocytes of PD patients, sRNA deep
sequencing reveals splicing changes that classify brain region tran-
scriptomes (Soreq et al., 2013). Characterization of sRNA species al—
teration in PD may provide the basis to understand pathogenesis of
PD and to target new non—invasive diagnosis biomarkers. However,
a full characterization of the sRNA transcriptome in PD (including
species other than miRNAs), is still lacking.

Current bioinformatics resources for the analysis of sRNA
sequencing data are mainly focused in miRNA detection and predic—
tion. The characterization of other types of sRNA is not deeply ad—
dressed in these tools and only a few of them produce outputs for
downstream analysis (Hoogstrate et al., 2014; Huang et al., 2010).
A major drawback in the analysis and quantification of the non—
miRNA sRNA is the presence of multi—mapping reads that derive
from tRNAs or non-coding RNA genes with duplication events on
the genome. The majority of the current bioinformatic tools apply
inaccurate strategies to handle these types of sequences and: (i)
directly discard them, resulting in an under—estimation of these elem—
ents or (ii) count them everywhere they map, causing an over—
estimation of their expression and making incorrect the use of
count—based differential expression analysis, since these methods as—
sume that reads are counted once.

Here, we have developed a framework to (i) characterize the full
set of sRNAs using an improved version of the Sequuster tool
(Pantano et al., 2011) that deals with multi—mapping reads and, (ii)
extract patterns of expression through data—mining analyses. We
used this framework to quantify all types of sRNAs from high-
throughput sequencing data of post—mortem brain samples at pre—
motor— and motor stages of PD and age—matched controls.
Subsequent data—mining analyses using the Sequuster output un—
covered sRNA signatures at premotor stages of the disease, involv—
ing several types of sRNAs. These results suggest that general sRNA
perturbations occur early in PD and further indicate that our pipe—
line is a sensitive tool to profile all types of sRNA.

2 Methods

2.1 General characterization of the sRNA

sequencing dataset
Brain samples were obtained from the Institute of Neuropathology
and the University of Barcelona Brain Bank. PD-related Braak

staging, RNA extraction and sRNA library preparation are detailed
in the Supplementary methods (Supplementary Table 81). Reads
were trimmed to 36 nt and ligation adapters removed using the
adrec.jar program from squuster suite (Pantano et al., 2010).
Sequences were mapped to the hg19 genome. sRNA processing,
mapping and annotation details are provided in Supplementary
Methods.

2.2 Definition of sRNA clusters

After adapter removal, sequences were collapsed among samples, re—
sulting in a set of unique sequences with the corresponding counts.
In this analysis, only sequences with more than 10 counts were con—
sidered. The pipeline detects hotspots after mapping sequences onto
the human genome (hg19 release). A hotspot is defined as a group of
at least 10 overlapping sequences, mapping onto a specific genomic
site.

The pipeline defines initial clusters, each consisting in several
hotspots sharing any number of sequences. We call these sequences
that map multiple times ambiguous sequences. We modified
Sequuster (Pantano et al., 2011) to get better summarization, anno-
tation and reports of clusters, and be able to use multiple mapping
sequences. We assume that all hotspots with ambiguous sequences
belong to the same sRNA cluster that may have one or multiple cop—
ies on the genome. In some cases, two hotspots may share a very
small proportion of ambiguous sequences, maybe due to gene diver—
gence or spurious alignments. It would be incorrect to consider this
as the same sRNA cluster since the two copies are essentially differ—
ent. To solve this, we apply a heuristic algorithm to end up with a
sRNA cluster that can be considered as a unique unit of transcrip—
tion (Fig. 1). The algorithm is based on two steps: (i) reduction and
(ii) cluster correction. The reduction step joins all hotspots that
share more than N sequences, (60% by default). We implemented a
proportion test to determine whether the percentage of common se—
quences among hotspots is above that value. If the P value of the
proportion test is < 0.05, the hotspots will be considered from the
same sRNA cluster.

After that, if there are multiple hotspots in the same sRNA clus—
ter with lower similarity (<60%), that cluster goes through the ‘clus—
ter correction’ step. We applied the—most—voting strategy, where
common sequences are assigned to the sRNA cluster with more se—
quences. After this step, a new sRNA cluster is created and will con—
tain sequences uniquely to this new cluster.

This strategy generates unique/final sRNA clusters, each iden—
tifying a type of sRNA that, although it may contain sequences map—
ping onto multiple genomic locations (hotspots), these are only
considered once. As a result, a cluster defines the expression pattern
of a type of sRNA, in which groups of sequences are consistently c0—
expressed, irrespective of their genomic origin. The full code is avail-
able at GitHub repository (http://github.com/lpantano/seqbuster),
and as a package at pypi (python package manager) (https://pypi.py—
thon.org/pypi/seqcluster).

In the present study, we detected a total of 2162 precursors (ini—
tial sRNA clusters) that were organized in 652 final sRNA clusters.
Only 127 initial clusters (with hotspots having <60% of similarity)
were split into three or more unique clusters (without ambiguous se—
quences), where ambiguous sequences contributed with less than
10% of sequences to these new clusters (Supplementary Fig. 81A).
This indicates that the ambiguous sequences among precursors of
different sRNA clusters were low expressed sequences compared to
the rest of sequences in each sRNA cluster. In many cases, all hot—
spots of an sRNA cluster shared all sequences, with hotspots

Differential Expression

Reduction + Correction

Fig. 1. General pipeline to define clusters of sRNAs (sRNA clusters), annotate miRNAs/isomiRs and perform downstream analyses to separate groups. Unique se-
quences are mapped onto the genome (steps 1 and 2). Miraligner detects miRNAs and isomiRs and generates a count matrix for all samples. For the rest, hot-
spots are defined (in this example H1—H5) as sets of overlapping sequences, according to their genomic positions (step 2). Colours show different types of sRNA,
derived from different classes of RNA precursors. The grey sequence has an uncertain origin because it maps on multiple sites. Primary clusters (CA and CB, in
the scheme) are subsequently defined as hotspots sharing any sequence. Then the pipeline goes through the reduction and the correction modules, based on re-
cursively heuristic steps that reorganize the hotspots in meaningful clusters of expression (step 3). To generate a final cluster (for instance, C1 and C2 in step 4)
the algorithm starts considering the most similar hotspots (H1—H2) in CA and joints them into a new hotspot (H'12). Then, the next similar hotspots within CA
(H3—H4) are taken and joined into another hotspot (H'34). All new hotspots that have similarity g 60% (or any other cut-off), will be labelled as conflict events. In
this case, the common sequences go to the bigger hotspot, and each of them becomes a different cluster (in this example H'12 ends as C1 and H'34 as C2). When
all initial clusters go through this step, Sequuster annotates them with an optional GTF file and generates the count matrix for downstream analysis (step 4).

Finally, both count matrixes (miRNA and cluster) are normalized with DESeq2 and used for PLS-DA and differential expression analysis (step 5)

differing only in the size (Supplementary Fig. 81B). In these cases, as
the pipeline runs through progressively more similar hotspots, all of
them are included in the same final sRNA cluster (without repeating
the sequences) using as hotspot/s those that contain the largest num—
ber of sequences.

For instance, an initial sRNA cluster formed by 50 hotspots was
reduced to three sRNA clusters with three hotspots. One of them
corresponds to sRNAs derived from tRNA—ARG—CCG that was
reduced from 20 precursors to one. The other two clusters are
sRNAs derived from the tRNA—ARG—CCT and another tRNA—
ARG—CCG. These three clusters are very similar, although they con—
tained some region—specific differences (Supplementary Fig. S22).
Therefore our strategy simplified annotation and interpretation of
the data and, at the same time kept enough specificity to detect
variability.

2.3 Partial least squares discriminant analysis

Partial least squares discriminant analysis (PLS—DA) is a technique
specifically appropriate for analysis of high dimensionality data sets
and multicollineality (Perez-Enciso and Tenenhaus, 2003). PLS—DA
is a supervised method (i.e. makes use of class labels) with the aim
to provide a dimension reduction strategy in a situation where we
want to relate a binary response variable (in our case control or

diseased status) to a set of predictor variables (in our study, sRNA
clusters) (Perez—Enciso and Tenenhaus, 2003) Dimensionality reduc—
tion procedure is based on orthogonal transformations of the ori-
ginal variables (clusters) into a set of linearly uncorrelated latent
variables (usually termed as components) such that maximizes the
separation between the different classes in the first few components
(Xia and Wishart, 2011). We used sum of squares captured by the
model (R2) as a goodness of fit measure.

Clusters with more than 10 counts in more than two samples
were taken into account and additionally we considered only clus—
ters expressed in at least 5 samples out of 14 being analysed (a total
of 621 clusters in controls versus premotor cases, or controls

versus motor cases). To avoid false separation caused by picking
up random noise rather than real signal, we conducted a permuta—
tion test (Xia and Wishart, 2011) involving 1000 data sets con—
structed by randomly reassigning class labels at each individual and
further performing PLS-DA on the new randomized data sets. We
further performed a PLS-DA for each of the main classes of sRNA
clusters and for the miscellaneous cluster list. We ensured for each
randomized data set that each group had a balanced number of cor—
rect and incorrect samples.

We conducted a refinement strategy to elude over parameterized
models with rather poor discriminant properties (Perez—Enciso and
Tenenhaus, 2003). In this sense, we obtained the most important

discriminant clusters from the four PLS—DA models based on the
analysis of the three main sRNA—clusters lists (miRNA—, tRNA— and
snoRNA—clusters) and the miscellaneous one, and conducted a se—
cond PLS-DA analysis including the important clusters associated
independently to the four different models. We used variable im—
portance for the projection (VIP) criterion that takes into account
the contribution of a specific predictor for both the explained vari—
ability on the response and the explained variability on the pre—
dictors. As a rule of thumb, it is customary to retain variables with
VIP > 0.8 (Perez-Enciso and Tenenhaus, 2003), however we used a
more strict criteria, VIP > 1.2, to ensure variable importance into
the whole model.

To evaluate significance of the refined strategy, we conducted
two different approaches to respond to two different concepts. The
first approach evaluates the robustness of the whole procedure,
which consisted in: (i) randomize the class labels of the individuals,
(ii) perform a PLS-DA analysis per each of the four different cluster
lists and (iii) conduct a PLS—DA analysis including VIP clusters asso—
ciated to the four different models. The second approach evaluates
whether the selected clusters (according to the VIP score) are only
useful for discriminating the target groups. For this latter purpose,
we conducted similar permutation analysis to that explained for the
general PLS-DA model, but including only the original VIP clusters
in each randomized data set.

Permutation—based P values were calculated following this
equation:

2R3 < R3

p—value: n+1

where R3 and R3 are the sum of squares captured by the model in
the real and randomized data sets respectively, and n is the number
of permutations.

2.4 Differential expression

We used DESeq2 for differential expression analysis and log2 trans-
formation of the count data. We used the count matrix generated by
Seqbuster and Sequuster. Following the same rationale as in the
PLS-DA analysis, only isomiRs, or clusters with more than 10
counts were taken into account and also sRNA—clusters or isomiRs
consistently expressed (counts > 10) in at least 5 samples out of the
14 included in each analysis (controls versus premotor cases and
controls versus motor cases). We performed permutation analysis to
compare the results with the background noise of the data (See
Supplementary material).

3 Results

3.1 Amygdala sRNA composition is complex, but
dominated by few abundant RNAs

To elucidate the role of sRNAs in PD, we subjected 21 human brain
samples to small RNA sequencing (sRNA—seq). We specifically
focused in the amygdala, a brain area presenting Lewy bodies (LB)
at pre—motor stages, the characteristic neuropathological hallmark
of PD (Braak et al., 2003, 2004). The samples comprised seven pre—
motor cases, seven motor cases and seven control individuals
(Supplementary Table 81, Supplementary methods). In addition,
technical replicates were made of the seven controls, for a total of
28 distinct sequencing libraries constructed. Following sequencing
on an Illumina HiSeq2000 instrument, the libraries each yielded be—
tween 10 and 20 million reads. After quality filtering, between 85
and 93% of the reads could be traced to genomic loci with high

Colour code as above. (D) Length distributions of sRNAs summed over seven

confidence (Supplementary Methods). As expected, most of the
sequenced RNAs originated from miRNAs (mean 56%), but there
were also substantial contributions from tRNAs (24%), rRNAs
(5%), snoRNAs (3%) and yRNAs (7%) (Fig. 2A and B). Although
hundreds of genes in each of these sRNA classes were expressed,
relatively few genes dominate the pool of sequenced RNA (Fig. 2C).
The biogenesis of sRNAs is often reﬂected in the length of the mol-
ecules. As expected, the miRNAs in our samples clearly tended to—
wards a length of 22 nucleotides (Fig. 2D).

Interestingly, the yRNA fragments clearly peaked at 32 nucleo—
tides and the tRNA fragments at 33 nucleotides. The fragments
from snoRNAs and rRNAs, did not exhibit any clear length peaks
(Supplementary Fig. 83A). Investigating the relation between the
amygdala sRNAs and their annotated host transcripts, we found
that the most expressed miRNA, tRNA and yRNA genes: mir-181a,
tRNA—Val—GTY and Y4, accounting for 18, 21 and 78% of the re—
spective classes, all yield fragments from specific positions in their
transcripts (Supplementary Fig. S4). We next investigated if these
three genes, mir-181a, Y4 and tRNA—Val—GTY, are representative
of their respective species. While miRNAs and tRNA fragments tend
to be 22 nt 33 nt long, the yRNAs tend to be more variable in length
(Supplementary Fig. SS ).

Hierarchical clustering (Supplementary Methods) to group the
28 libraries based on their sRNA compositions reflects the path—
ology of the brain samples, since controls grouped together although
they were prepared in independent batches (left of the sequenced
dendrogram, Supplementary Fig. S3B). Finally, plotting the lengths
RNAs showed sRNA length profile is enough to define the library
compositions: libraries enriched in miRNAs tend to comprise RNAs
that are ~22 nucleotides in length, while those enriched in tRNAs
tend to contain RNAs that are ~33 nucleotides in length.

3.2 Improvements to the Sequuster tool
Sequuster organizes sRNAs in units or clusters of co—expressed mol—
ecules, consistently mapping to a host transcript (Pantano et al.,

2011). A distinctive characteristic of this tool is that it objectively
assigns each sequence to a cluster, at which the correspondent
counts are assigned (Supplementary Methods). We have upgraded
the original pipeline, which in its current version generates a count
matrix for all samples that can be used downstream profiling ana—
lyses (Fig. 1).

The new version of Sequuster has important improvements that
allow correct quantification of all types of sncRNA and a better ex—
ploratory analysis: (i) While the first version was java—based inter—
face for exploratory analysis, this version, is a python based
command line tool that can be integrated into any bioinformatic
framework focused in the quantification, annotation and visualiza—
tion; (ii) It is totally integrated in python allowing easy installation
and usage of already published packages for common bioinformatic
tasks; (iii) It handles all samples at the same time, reducing the time
and number of commands needed to process a full project; (iv) It
generates a count matrix that can be used for differential expression
or clustering analyses; (v) It uses pysam and bedtools for the align—
ment and annotation that improves reproducibility, ensuring correct
results since these tools are highly tested by the community; (vi) It
works with known formats removing any custom format from the
previous version; (vii) The algorithm to detect clusters has been
modified in order to remove some dependencies that complicate in—
stallation and improve memory and time resources, taking less than
20 min to run a total of 28 samples—20 million reads/sample—in a
single machine with 8GB of RAM); (viii) The whole analysis is
wrapped in bcbio—nextgen framework that produces isomiRs/clus—
ters results in html format with a single command line [http://github.
com/Chapmanb/bcbio—nextgen]; (ix) isomiRs count matrix gener-
ation, PLS-DA and DE analysis are integrated in a R package:
isomiRs (http://github.com/lpantano/isomiRs).

To validate the quantification potential of Sequuster, we ana—
lyzed the publicly available miRQC samples (Mestdah et al., 2014)
with Sequuster and used the generated sRNA clusters count matrix
for relative expression analysis. Four samples were considered: A,
containing 100% Universal Human miRNA Reference RNA; B,
100% human brain RNA; and two titrations thereof (C : 0.75A —I—
0.25B and D : 0.25A —I— 0.75B). For clusters more abundant in A
versus B (A > B) or in B versus A (B > A), the vast majority were cor—
rectly ordered when comparing all groups (A > C > D > B) or

(B > D > C > A), respectively (see Supplementary Table S3); suggest—
ing that Sequuster detects titration and therefore it is an appropri-
ate tool to quantify sRNAs (http://seqcluster.readthedocs.org/
example_pipeline.html#mirqc—data).

3.3 Amygdala host transcripts give rise to specific
sRNAs that are organized in hundreds of sRNA clusters
To have a qualitative and quantitative estimation of expressed
sRNAs in each sample, we structured overlapping sequences in clus—
ters, using the improved version of Sequuster.

A total of 635 sRNA clusters were identified in the 28 samples
(Supplementary Table S2), the majority of which mapped onto
miRNA precursors (36.2%); onto C/D box small nucleolar RNAs
(C/D box snoRNAs), H/ACA box snoRNAs and small Cajal body—
specific RNAs (scaRNAs) (30%); and tRNAs (16.8%). The remain—
ing 108 clusters (17%) contained a variety of sRNA mapping onto
different types of precursors, including small cytoplasmic RNAs
(scRNAs) genes, and a variety of non—characterized transcripts, that
are also detected by the ENCODE consortium. The composition,
abundance and mapping positions of all sequences within a cluster
can be visualized in a html generated by the pipeline.

3.4 Partial least square discriminant analysis identifies
sRNA expression patterns that distinguish control
individuals from PD patients at premotor and motor
stages.

Partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS—DA) is a supervised
multivariate method that was used to explore if the expression pat—
tern of sRNAs could classify controls versus affected individuals
(Table 1). A general PLS—DA was first performed separately in con—
trols versus premotor cases and controls versus motor cases to avoid
experimental bias related with independent sequencing experiments.
Using the list of sRNA clusters PLS—DA build a model that could sig—
nificantly explain 86% of the response variability (control or PD—
motor stages) (P = 0.049). A similar analysis could not discriminate
controls from premotor cases (R2 = 28%, P = 0.6). To evaluate if
different types of sRNAs contributed specifically to the model, we
performed a PLS-DA for each of the main classes of sRNAs clusters
and the list containing miscellaneous sRNA clusters (Table 1).

Fig. 3. Refined PLS-DA of sRNA clusters (A) and isomiRs (B) expression data.
PLS-DA score scatter plot of the three components for control and affected in-
dividuals, showing separation of controls from premotor cases and controls
from motor cases. Refined PLS-DA was performed with the more relevant
sRNA clusters (V|P> 1.2) of each class (miRNA, snoRNAs, tRNAs, and the
rest) (A) or the more relevant isomiRs (VIP >1.2) (B) separating controls from
affected individuals of a primary PLS-DA with consistently expressed
sequences

A PLS-DA using the list of clusters that mapped onto tRNAs better
separated controls and affected patients both at motor (R2 =
88.4%, P = 0.014) and premotor stages (R2 = 99.3 P = 0.001), sug—
gesting that this class of sRNAs undergo early perturbation in PD.

PLS—DA provides the variable importance in projection (VIP)
score that measures the relevance that each cluster provides to the
model (Supplementary Fig. S6). Interestingly, 13 of the highly im-
portant tRNA—clusters (VIP score> 1.2; Supplementary Table S4
and Fig. S7) were common in PLS—DA of controls versus premotor
cases and controls versus motor cases, suggesting that their com—
bined expression pattern may define initial events in PD.

To improve the classification between control individuals and
diseased patients, we performed a new PLS—DA, using a re-defined
shorter list of clusters with a high (> 1.2) VIP score (Fig. 3A,
Supplementary Fig. S8, Tables SS and S6). This list could discrimin-
ate controls from PD—motor cases (R2 = 88.4%) or PD—premotor
cases (R2 = 99.1%). This refined PLS-DA confirmed the former
PLS-DA (Table 1), showing that among the top contributors, tRNA
clusters were significantly enriched (Supplementary Fig. S6 and
Table S7). A total of 12 clusters with high VIP scores (>1.2) were
common in PLS-DA of controls versus motor cases and controls ver—
sus premotor cases, suggesting their early perturbation in PD.

PLS-DA using miRNA clusters could not separate controls and
affected individuals (Table 1). However, miRNA clusters contain
all sequences mapping onto each miRNA—precursor and therefore
miRNA-3p or miRNA-5p forms are not distinguished. Similarly,
miRNA clusters definition does not distinguish miRNA isoforms
(isomiRs). IsomiRs are miRNAs that vary slightly in sequence,
which result from variations in the cleavage site during miRNA
biogenesis (5’ -trimming and 3’—trimming variants), nucleotide add—
itions to the 3’—end of the mature miRNA (3’ addition variants)

and nucleotide modifications (substitution variants) (Marti et al.,

2010; Pantano et al., 2010). Because miRNAs and IsomiRs have
important roles in the CNS maintenance and function (Cloonan
et al., 2011; Fernandez—Valverde et al., 2010), we performed a
PLS-DA using an isomiR expression dataset, defined by the
Seqbuster tool (Pantano et al., 2010). More than 5000 isomiRs
were consistently detected in the human amygdala samples, corres—
ponding to 539 miRNAs. Using this list, we performed a first PLS-
DA (Supplementary Table S8), and a refined version with the
isomiRs with the highest VIP scores (>1.2) from the first PLS-DA
could significantly discriminate controls from premotor or motor
cases (Fig. 3B, Supplementary Table S8), suggesting that miRNAs
are early altered in PD.

To validate these results, we applied a non—supervised method
principal component analysis (PCA) using clusters or isomiRs with
high VIP scores (>1.2). As shown in Supplementary Figure S9, the
first two components from PCA could clearly separate controls from
motor cases, explaining around 50% of clusters variability. This
was not so clear at early stages of the disease, where only the second
component (with 16% of clusters variability) generally separated
controls from premotor cases. When analyzing isomiRs the two first
components from PCA discriminated controls versus patients at
both motor and premotor stages explaining as well 5 0% of the total
variability.

3.5 Differential expression analysis identified selective
sRNA clusters and isomiRs deregulated in the
amygdala at premotor and motor stages
In addition to the identification of global patterns of sRNA clusters
that distinguished controls from diseased samples using PLS—DA, we
evaluated whether single clusters were differently expressed between
control individuals and patients at premotor stages or motor stages.
Differential expression was evaluated using DESeq2 with sRNA
clusters. Among the differently expressed sRNA clusters (nominal P
value < 0.05), hierarchical clustering analysis, which is blind to sam—
ple type, showed that the 20 with the highest significance separated
all premotor cases and a control sample in the same cluster (Fig. 4A,
Supplementary Table S9 and Fig. 810). Considering these 20 sRNA
clusters, shuffling the identity of the patients or randomly taking
groups of 10 clusters from the full set resulted in the significant loss
of separation (Supplementary Fig. 811A). Of these 20 sRNA—clus—
ters, 7 mapped onto tRNA, 7 onto C/D Box snoRNA, 5 onto
miRNAs precursors and an additional sRNA—cluster onto an
uncharacterized transcript. Half of these sRNA clusters presented
high VIP scores (>1.2) in the PLS-DA analysis (Fig. 4A,
Supplementary Table S9). Overall, these data suggest that these dif—
ferently expressed clusters may define PD—premotor cases. A similar
analysis identified 10 differently expressed clusters that optimally
separated the group of controls from motor cases (Fig. 4B,
Supplementary Table S9, Figs 810B and 812). Six of these top
sRNA—clusters mapped onto tRNAs and 4 onto C/D Box snoRNAs.
In accordance with their possible relevance, these clusters presented
a high VIP score (VIP > 1.2) in the refined PLS-DA.

Differential expression analysis was also performed for isomiRs.
A total of 85 differently expressed isomiRs (nominal P value < 0.05)
corresponding to 42 miRNAs significantly separated all control indi-
viduals and premotor cases in two main groups (Fig. 4C,
Supplementary Table 810). In addition, 230 differently expressed
isomiRs corresponding to 104 miRNAs significantly separated con—
trols and premotor cases. Importantly, the vast majority of isomiRs
presented a significant VIP score (>1.2) according to the PLS-DA
(Supplementary Table 810). In each of the comparisons, clustering

of the two groups of samples was lost if shuffling the identity of the
patients or randomly choosing different groups of isomiRs among
the total expressed (Supplementary Fig. 811C, D). Twenty—one
miRNAs and more specifically, seven isomiRs were commonly
deregulated in premotor and motor cases, suggesting their early af—
fectation in PD.

3.6 Benchmarking with sRNAbench

To our knowledge, there are only two additional tools that, similarly
to the present pipeline, can annotate different types of small RNAs
and handle multi—mapped reads: sRNAbench (Hackenberg et al.,
2011) and flaimapper (Hoogstrate et al., 2014). We therefore used
these tools to repeat the analyses with our sequencing dataset, focus—
ing in the sRNAs that map onto tRNAs because this class is highly
enriched in multi—mapping sequences and is the type that optimally
separated affected and control individuals.

Flaimapper failed to successfully process the individual BAM
files due to RAM memory issues (it failed in a 64GB RAM memory
machine). Regarding sRNAbench, it produces outputs with uniquely
mapped reads and multi—mapped reads, with these last being
counted repeatedly in each mapping site. We separately used both
types of count matrix for PLS—DA, to determine the influence of
multi—mapped reads in the analysis. While PLS-DA using uniquely
mapping tRNAs could not separate controls and affected

individuals, multi—mapping tRNAs tended to better distinguish
groups (Supplementary Table 811). However, when comparing con-
trols with premotor cases, differences were not significant, indicat—
ing that Sequuster outperformed this tool. Furthermore, differential
expression analysis of tRNA and isomiRs with sRNAbench output
showed that the signal of differences among groups was reduced or
disappeared (Supplementary Table 812). Overall these data suggest
that using multi—mapped bits is important and further indicates that
processing the data to unique clusters helps to separate affected indi—
viduals from controls.

4 Discussion

Our study provides the first deep characterization of the sRNA tran-
scriptome at different stages of LB pathology and parkinsonism in
post—mortem brain samples. We have used a strategy that organizes
the transcriptome in unique units of consistently co—expressed
sRNAs (sRNA clusters) using an improved version of the Sequuster
tool (Pantano et al., 2011). This approach simplifies the complexity
of the sRNA transcriptome, arranging millions of sequences into
hundreds of sRNA clusters, which permits a downstream compre—
hensive profiling.

Using the sRNA—cluster count matrix, we could significantly
separate control individuals from clinical/motor cases. However,
expression profiles of tRNA clusters better separated controls from
affected individuals at different stages of LB pathology, compared
with other functional classes of co—expressed sRNAs. tRNA—
derived sRNAs correct annotation and quantification is specially
challenging, given that the majority map onto multiple locations.
Our strategy successfully overcomes this problem through a pro-
gressive and heuristic allocation of each multi—mapped sequence to
a specific (tRNA) gene with one or multiple precursors (see
Methods). Using the expression matrix of tRNA—genes, we demon—
strate that multi—mapping sequences are important to classify dis—
eased status.

It has been recently shown that non—random 20—35 nt tRNA
fragments (tRFs) guide mRNA cleavage, control translation and
show cross talk with canonical sRNA silencing pathways, through a
variety of mechanisms (Durdevic et al., 2013; Gebetsberger and
Polacek, 2013; Selitsky et al., 2015; Sobala and Hutvagner, 2011;
Sobala and Hutvagner, 2013). In addition, accumulation of 5 ’ halves
of different types of tRNAs are produced in response to oxidative
stress (OS) in a wide variety of eukaryotes (Saikia et al., 2012;
Thompson et al., 2008). The majority of the top—deregulated tRNA
fragments presented highly abundant 5’—tRFs, with most showing
up—regulation at premotor and motor stages (Supplementary Table
S2). Because OS is a major hallmark in PD brains (Ferrer et al.,
2011), it is tempting to speculate about the participation of this
pathway in tRFs accumulation.

miRNA clusters that contained all types of co—expressed se—
quences mapping onto each miRNA could not discriminate controls
and affected individuals. However, we captured disease stage—
specific profiles using a list of isomiRs, which are slightly varying
miRNA sequences with the potential to influence silencing dynamics
(Cloonan et al., 2011; Fernandez—Valverde et al., 2010; Llorens
et al., 2013).

The proportion of the different classes of IsomiRs (5’ trimming,
3’—trimming, 3’—addition and nt—substitution) was similar in the
group of deregulated isomiRs and the total number of isomiRs, indi-
cating that no general alterations occur in the mechanisms generat—
ing the main types of isomiRs. Instead, disease—IsomiR profiles may

reﬂect changes in the biogenesis and/or stability of selective
miRNAs variants; raising the question of whether mechanisms finely
modulating the biogenesis of each miRNA may reﬂect an early dys—
function of the brain. In line with this, differential changes in the ex-
pression of specific isomiRs relative to those of the consensus
(reference) counterpart have been found in several neurodegenera—
tive disorders (Hebert et al., 2013; Marti et al., 2010).

In the present study, we found many deregulated miRNAs previ—
ously associated with PD and other neurodegenerative disorders,
including miR-9, miR-181c, miR-146a, miR-16 and miR-124
(Supplementary Table 813). We confirmed the deregulation pattern
of 26 miRNAs (out of 34) (Supplementary Table 813), whose pre—
cursors were altered in PD brains (Kim et al., 2007). We also con—
firmed the deregulation pattern of 10 out of 18 miRNAs in total
blood of PD patients (Martins et al., 2011) and 3 out of 17 in leuko—
cytes of PD patients (Soreq et al., 2013) (Supplementary Table 813).
Other miRNAs associated with PD (Alvarez—Erviti et al., 2013; Cho
et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2007; Minones—Moyano et al., 2011; Soreq
et al., 2103) were not confirmed in our analysis either because deep
sequencing approach could not reliably detect them or showed a
high variability between samples.

In summary, the present workﬂow revealed an overall alteration
of sRNA profiles in the amygdala of PD brains that occurs early, at
premotor stages. A similar analysis in peripheral blood samples of
patients at diverse disease stages and compared with control samples
will answer whether our strategy is useful as a diagnosis tool in PD.
tRFs and miRNAs (isomiRs) are the more relevant sRNAs types
classifying affected individuals at different stages. We propose tRFs
as a new class of early—stage biomarkers that may reflect OS in the
brain of neurodegenerative disease patients. Other sRNAs species
were deregulated in PD, mapping onto snoRNAs, repeated element
sequences and other uncharacterized RNAs of uncertain function.
An important future task is to go beyond the identification of dis—
ease—classifying sRNAs and associate them with functions. This will
likely likely shed light onto the involvement of sRNAs pathways in
PD patients as compared with controls, and between varying disease
progression stages.

ABSTRACT

Summary: PONDEROSA (Peak-picking Of Noe Data Enabled
by Restriction of Shift Assignments) accepts input information
consisting of a protein sequence, backbone and sidechain
NMR resonance assignments, and 3D-NOESY (BC-edited and/or
15 N-edited) spectra, and returns assignments of NOESY crosspeaks,
distance and angle constraints, and a reliable NMR structure
represented by a family of conformers. PONDEROSA incorporates
and integrates external software packages (TALOS+, STRIDE and
CYANA) to carry out different steps in the structure determination.
PONDEROSA implements internal functions that identify and validate
NOESY peak assignments and assess the quality of the calculated
three-dimensional structure of the protein. The robustness of
the analysis results from PONDEROSA’s hierarchical processing
steps that involve iterative interaction among the internal and
external modules. PONDEROSA supports a variety of input formats:
SPARKY assignment table (.shifts) and spectrum file formats (.ucsf),
XEASY proton file format (.prot), and NMR-STAR format (.star).
To demonstrate the utility of PONDEROSA, we used the package
to determine 3D structures of two proteins: human ubiquitin and
Escherichia coli iron-sulfur scaffold protein variant lch(D39A). The
automatically generated structural constraints and ensembles of
conformers were as good as or better than those determined
previously by much less automated means.

along with tutorials and reference manuals, is available at

1 INTRODUCTION

A major challenge of structural biology is to close the gap
between known sequences of proteins [>1 x 108 in GenBank
(Benson et al., 2008)] and their 3D structures (~1x105 in
PDB; Berman et al., 2000). Automation now plays a key role
in speeding up the determination of protein structures by X—ray
crystallography. However, the determination of protein structures
by NMR spectroscopy includes a larger number of steps that
present greater challenges for automation. The steps basically are

sequential; however, some of them may need to be iterated in order
to yield a satisfactory protein structure. Software packages have
been developed to automate individual steps, and in some cases
to pipeline several steps (Bahrami et al., 2009; Lopez—Mendez and
Gﬁntert, 2006). One of the challenges has been to automate the ﬁnal
steps beyond backbone and sidechain peak assignment, including
the determination of torsion angle constraints, the assignment of
NOESY cross peaks and the determination of distance constraints,
the analysis of secondary structure, and the calculation of a validated
3D protein structure. The PONDEROSA (Peak-picking Of Noe Data
Enabled by Restriction of Shift Assignments) software package
described here bridges this gap and is meant to be used with
an automated resonance assignment package such as PINE-NMR
introduced earlier by our group (Bahrami et al., 2009).

2 IMPLEMENTATION

PONDEROSA (Supplementary Fig. SlA) accepts resonance
assignments in popular ﬁle formats (SPARKY; T.D. Goddard
and D. G. Kneller, SPARKY 3; University of California,
San Francisco, XEASY; Bartels et al., 1995 or NMR—STAR;
http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu/dictionaryl), an amino acid sequence
ﬁle in either one- or three-letter code, and 13C—NOESY and/0r
15N-NOESY datasets in SPARKY (.ucsf) format. By integrating
internal functions and external programs, PONDEROSA provides
as output NOE peak lists, NOE assignments, structural constraints
and a family of conformers representing the 3D structure.

Internal functions: The major internal functions of PONDEROSA
simulate and validate NOESY peaks and manage interactions among
the internal and external software routines. PONDEROSA uses
available resonance assignments to simulate all possible short,
medium— and long-range peaks (Supplementary Figs S2 and S3).
Members of the set of simulated peaks are validated by comparing
them to peaks detected in the experimental NOESY datasets under
different threshold levels. The sets of validated peak lists are
provided to the external programs that determine torsion angle
restraints, assign NOESY peaks, calculate structures and analyze
secondary structure. The results from these programs are recycled
to PONDEROSA for the next iteration (Supplementary Fig. S4).

PONDEROSA examines the effect of the threshold level on a
structural quality score that incorporates the root mean standard
deviation (RMSD) of backbone atoms in structured regions as
determined by STRIDE, the number of constraint and van der
Waals Violations, and number of residues in favored and disallowed
Ramachandran regions. If both 13C— and 15N-edited NOESY

data are present, PONDEROSA interactively determines optimal
thresholds for each.

External programs: PONDEROSA interacts with TALOS+ (Shen
et al., 2009) for identifying structured regions and for determining
torsion angle restraints from assigned chemical shifts, STRIDE
(Frishman et al., 1995) for analyzing secondary structure, and
CYANA (Giintert, 2004) for assigning NOESY cross peaks and
calculating 3D structures.

Graphical User Interface: An intuitive graphical user interface
(Supplementary Fig. S1B) enables speciﬁcation of the number of
CPU nodes, steps and cycles to be used in CYANA iterations, the
limit on the number of NOESY peaks to be searched for on the basis
of local peak maxima, and the weighting factors for RMSD distance
Violations and torsion angle dispersions.

3 RESULTS AND CONCLUSION

We selected two proteins to illustrate the use of PONDEROSA
for NOESY peak picking and automated structure determination:
human ubiquitin (76 residues) and Escherichia coli iron—sulfur
scaffold protein variant Ich(D39A) (128 residues). We chose
human ubiquitin because it is a well-known test sample for protein
NMR technology development with 3D structures deposited in
the Protein Data Bank (PDB), e.g. 1D3Z (Cornilescu et al.,
1998). We chose Ich(D39A) (Kim et al., 2009) because it
is a larger protein with a recently deposited non-automatically
derived NMR structure (PDB 2KQK) that exhibited variation in
the position of secondary structural elements within the family of
20 conformers. In determining the structures of both proteins, we
used 1H—15N HSQC, 1H—13C HSQC, CBCA(CO)NH, HNCACB
and HBHA(CO)NH datasets for backbone assignments, and
(H)CC(CO)NH, H(CC)(CO)NH and HCCH—TOCSY datasets for
sidechain assignments. We used NMRpipe (Delaglio et al., 1995) to
process all spectra and then converted the spectra to SPARKY (.ucsf)
ﬁles. We used PINE-NMR and PINE—SPARKY (Lee et al., 2009)
to assign the spectra of human ubiquitin, but assigned Ich(D39A)
by a manual assignment strategy. We processed 3D 13C-NOESY
and 15N-NOESY datasets with NMRPipe and converted the spectra
to .ucsf ﬁles for input to PONDEROSA. The total times required
for the structure determinations with 24 CPUs were 9 h for human
ubiquitin and 15 h for Ich(D39A).

The 20 best conformers of human ubiquitin determined by
PONDEROSA (Supplementary Fig. S1C) had a RMSD of 0.09 A
for backbone atoms and 0.48 A for all heavy atoms in structured

regions. The 20 best conformers of Ich(D39A) determined by
PONDEROSA had an RMSD of 0.20 A for backbone atoms
and 0.61 A for all heavy atoms in structured regions. The
structures determined by PONDEROSA were very similar to those
determined earlier by more manual approaches: 1.15 A RMSD for
the backbone atoms of human ubiquitin (PONDEROSA versus
1D3Z) and 1.30 A for structured backbone atoms Ich(D39A)
(PONDEROSA versus 2KQK) (Supplementary Fig. S1D). Analysis
by two standard validation suites, PSVS (Bhattacharya et al., 2007)
and iCing (http://nmr.cmbi.ru.nl/icing/#welcome), revealed that the
PONDEROSA-derived structures were of equivalent quality to the
structures of the same proteins in the Protein Data Bank (1D3Z and
2KQK) determined by less automated means.

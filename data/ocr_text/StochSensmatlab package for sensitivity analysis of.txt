ABSTRACT

Motivation: The growing interest in the role of stochasticity in
biochemical systems drives the demand for tools to analyse
stochastic dynamical models of chemical reactions. One powerful
tool to elucidate performance of dynamical systems is sensitivity
analysis. Traditionally, however, the concept of sensitivity has mainly
been applied to deterministic systems, and the difficulty to generalize
these concepts for stochastic systems results from necessity of
extensive Monte Carlo simulations.

Results: Here we present a Matlab package, StochSens, that
implements sensitivity analysis for stochastic chemical systems
using the concept of the Fisher Information Matrix (FIM). It uses the
linear noise approximation to represent the FIM in terms of solutions
of ordinary differential equations. This is the first computational
tool that allows for quick computation of the Information
Matrix for stochastic systems without the need for Monte Carlo
simulations.

1 INTRODUCTION

In the past decade, dynamic modelling of biochemical systems using
stochastic approaches has become increasingly popular as the role of
stochastic effects has turned out to be signiﬁcant for the functioning
of living cells. The dynamical behaviour of such systems can not
be understand by intuition alone but requires computational tools
for the analysis. In the case of deterministic models sensitivity
analysis is a concept that greatly helps to understand the dependance
between parameter values and the dynamic outputs. Various software
packages have become available to address this problem [e. g.
Maiwald and Timmer (2008); Rodriguez—Femandez and Banga
(2010); DA. Rand (2008)]. The classical sensitivity coefﬁcient can
simply be understood as a derivative of an output Q with respect to
a parameter 6. The behaviour of a stochastic system, however, is not
deﬁned by an observable Q that can be measured in a reproducible
way. Instead it is deﬁned by a distribution with density w from
which measurements are taken. Therefore, there is a qualitative
difference how outputs of stochastic and deterministic systems need

to be quantiﬁed. In order to predict a change in the behaviour of a
deterministic system resulting from a perturbation in a parameter it is
possible to calculate the derivative. In case of a stochastic system one
needs to see how a distribution changes. Changes in the distribution
1p with respect to a change in the parameter 6 are traditionally
quantiﬁed as the expected value of a squared inﬁnitesimal change
in the logarithm of the density,
2
1(9)=E(—810gWX’6)) . (1)
86
This quantity is called the Fisher Information (FI) and requires
the value of the parameter 6 to be known (or at least a plausible
range). When calculated for a vector of parameters it is called Fisher
Information Matrix (FIM). FI behaves locally as the Kullback—
Leibler divergence and is directly related to the curvature of the
expected likelihood function, therefore it is a natural measure
of local sensitivity [see Supplementary User Manual (UM)]. The
possibility to evaluate Equation (1) for stochastic models of chemical
kinetics has been previously achieved by the means of Monte
Carlo simulation of model variables [see e.g. Gunawan et al.
(2005); Plyasunov and Arkin (2007)]. Recently we proposed to
evaluate Equation (1) by approximating 1p through the linear noise
approximation, and expressing the ﬁrst two momements of 1p and
their derivatives in terms of ordinary differential equations (ODEs)
[Komorowski et al. (2011)].

The applicability of F1 extends much further than only to
sensitivity analysis. It is a primary tool to study robustness,
understood as stability of behaviour under simultaneous changes
to model parameters; to guide optimal experimental design; and for
identiﬁability analysis that determines whether certain parameters
can be estimated from experimental data of a given type.

Here we present a Matlab package, StochSens, which implements
symbolic and numerical procedures to calculate the FIM for
stochastic chemical kinetics models as proposed in [Komorowski
et al. (2011)]. It is the ﬁrst package that allows computation
of the FIM without Monte Carlo simulations; calculations are
therefore very efﬁcient and can easily be repeated for different
parameter sets and alternative versions of a model corresponding to
different experimental setups. The algorithm for FIM computation
is accompanied by functions for its analysis, visualization and
comparison. Models of Lotka—Voltera systems and Michaelis—
Menten kinetics have been used to demonstrate the applicability
of the package in the Supplementary Material. Two other models
(a model of single gene expression and p53 system) have been also
included as examples.

2 METHODS

The package is implemented as a set of Matlab functions. Any model to be
analysed using these functions needs to be deﬁned in terms of a stoichiometry
matrix, here a Matlab function containing reaction rates, and a vector of
parameter values. From these ﬁles a set of ODEs is generated using the
Matlab Symbolic Toolbox. Equations are then solved using the Matlab ODE
solver and the solutions are used to calculate the FIM. The FIM can be
calculated for three types of data: time series (TS), time—point (TP) and
deterministic (DT). For TS measurements are assumed to be taked at different
times from a single trajectory (e. g. following the same cell using ﬂuorescent
microscopy). TP measurements at each time point are taken from different
trajectories (e.g. end time points of trajectories following different cells).
These data reﬂect experimental setups where the sample is sacriﬁced to make
a measurement (e.g. ﬂow—cytometry). DT data are deﬁned as a solution of
deterministic equations with normally distributed measurement error and
refer to measurements averaged over population of cells. Graphical output
has been implemented to visualize and compare FIMs between data types,
parameter sets and perturbations of initial conditions.

2.1 Applicability

The applicability of the package results directly from a special role that the
FI plays in the model analysis [Komorowski et al. (2011)]. In particular, the
package can provide insight resulting from:

(i) Sensitivity analysis. The sensitivity coefﬁcients can be directly
extracted from the FIM and the most sensitive parameters can
be ranked providing information about the origins of the observed
stochastic dynamics. In addition, comparison of sensitivity coefﬁcients
between stochastic and deterministic version of a model can determine
parameters controlling stochasticity: parameters with high sensitivities
for a stochastic model and low sensitivities for the corresponding
deterministic model control stochastic effects in a system. A set
of provided Matlab functions can calculate and analyse sensitivity
coefﬁcients.

(ii) Robustness of a system is usually understood as its insensitivity to
perturbations caused by external conditions. It is usually examined
by considering simultaneous perturbations of all model parameters.
The F1 is a natural tool to quantify changes in systems behaviour in
response to perturbations in parameters. For this purpose, it can be
visualised as a corresponding quadratic form. Contour lines of these
quadratic forms describe sets of points in parameter space that result
in a similar change in the behaviour compared to an initial parameter
set. Therefore, regions within these ellipsoids are called Neural Spaces
(NS); we provide a set of functions to plot and compare NS’s across
models.

(iii) Identiﬁability. The number of identiﬁable model parameters is equal to
the number of (effectively) non—zero eigenvalues of the FIM. Analysis
of eigenvalues therefore provides information as to which parameters
can be estimated from a particular data type. Having calculated the
FIM, identiﬁability analysis is straightforward.

(iv) Optimal experimental design. The FIM is a key tool to quantify
information from particular experimental data. It provides a rationale
as to which variables can be measured experimentally, or what
perturbation should be applied, or what sampling frequency should
be used. Different experimental settings can be encoded within
the package and resulting information can be compared to guide
experimental design.

2.2 Biological relevance—example

The differences in the FIMs that exist between stochastic and deterministic
models is an interesting example highlighting the biological relevance
of our package. In order to demonstrate this we use the example of
Michaelis—Menten (MM) enzyme kinetics that can be represented as

molecule (E) with forward rate constant kg and backward rate constant
k1 to form a complex (C), which then falls apart into the enzyme and a
product (P). In addition we assume that (S) molecules are being generated
at rate kb, and product molecules (P) degrade at rate kd, and that the system
has reached its unique steady state. In Fig. 1 we plot neutral spaces that
correspond to the FIM for two pairs of parameters (160,161,) and (kb,kd)
for a stochastic model (heat map) and deterministic model (contour plot).
Plotted differences have a clear biological interpretation: in a deterministic
regime, in order to keep dynamic behaviour unchanged, change in the arrival
rate (kb) can not be compensated by an increase in a complex formation
rate (k0) as both parameters are approximately orthogonal; in a stochastic
regime such a compensation is possible: change in kg, can be to a certain
extend compensated by change in kg. Therefore, if the output of the MM
system is considered as a distribution of stochastic trajectories rather than
a deterministic mean then such an output is more robust as depicted by the
ellipsoids in Fig. 1. Analogous analysis can be used to study the relation
between arrival rate kg, and decay rate kd.

3 DISCUSSION

StochSens is a new, computationally efﬁcient and extendable Matlab
package for computation and analysis of FIM’s for stochastic (and
deterministic) dynamical models of chemical reactions. Compared
to sensitivity packages for deterministic models it accounts for the
information that is contained in the noise structure. This together
with the high interest in stochasticity in biochemical systems imply
that our package can ﬁnd wide applicability and be a basis for further
extensions.

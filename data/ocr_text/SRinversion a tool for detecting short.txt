Abstract

Motivation: Rapid development in sequencing technologies has dramatically improved our ability
to detect genetic variants in human genome. However, current methods have variable sensitivities
in detecting different types of genetic variants. One type of such genetic variants that is especially
hard to detect is inversions. Analysis of public databases showed that few short inversions have
been reported so far. Unlike reads that contain small insertions or deletions, which will be con—
sidered through gap alignment, reads carrying short inversions often have poor mapping quality
or are unmapped, thus are often not further considered. As a result, the majority of short inversions
might have been overlooked and require special algorithms for their detection.

Results: Here, we introduce SRinversion, a framework to analyze poorly mapped or unmapped
reads by splitting and re—aligning them for the purpose of inversion detection. SRinversion is very
sensitive to small inversions and can detect those less than 10 bp in size. We applied SRinversion
to both simulated data and high—coverage sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project and
compared the results with those from Pindel, BreakDancer, DELLY, Gustaf and MID. A better per—
formance of SRinversion was achieved for both datasets for the detection of small inversions.
Availability and Implementation: SRinversion is implemented in Perl and is publicly available at
http://paed.hku.hk/genome/software/SRinversion/index.html.

1 Introduction

 

Inversions are a type of structural variations (SVs) that may play an
important role in human genetic diversity and disease susceptibility
(Antonacci et 61]., 2009; Bondeson et 61]., 1995; Feuk et 61]., 2005,
2006; Giglio et 61]., 2001, 2002; Gimelli et 61]., 2003; Koolen et 61].,
2006; Kurotaki et 61]., 2003; Lakich et 61]., 1993; Osborne et 61]., 2001;
Stefansson et 61]., 2005; Steinberg et 61]., 2012; Visser et 61]., 2005;
Zody et 61]., 2008). On one hand, inversions can be directly related to
human diseases, such as the inversion that interrupts the coagulation
factor VIII (F8) gene, causing haemophilia A (Lakich et 61]., 1993), or
the iduronate 2—sulphatase (IDS) gene that causes Hunter syndrome

(Bondeson et 61]., 1995). Inversions can also have functional impact by
either inducing or being associated With other structural changes. It
has been reported that inversions in parental genomes could induce
disease—associated copy number variations (CNV) in the offspring
(Feuk et 61]., 2006; Gimelli et 61]., 2003; Osborne et 61]., 1995). Despite
these examples that highlight the functional significance of inversions,
our ability to detect this type of genetic variants remains limited.

Over the past decade, the rapid development and extended use
of next—generation sequencing technology have widened the spec—
trum of SVs detected (Bentley et 61]., 2008; Iafrate et 61]., 2004;
Korbel et 61]., 2007; McKernan et 61]., 2009; Stankiewicz and Lupski,

2010; The 1000 Genomes Project Consortium, 2012; Tuzun et al.,
2005; Wheeler et al., 2008). Nevertheless, unlike other SVs such as
deletions, insertions and CNVs, detection of inversions has been lag—
ging behind. Analysis of sequencing data was reported to be able to
find around 80% of known deletions, but for inversions the fraction
of detection is still insignificant so far (Baker, 2012). As shown in
Supplementary Figure S1, summary of all records on SVs to date
from public databases such as deAR (Church et al., 2010) and
DGVa (MacDonald et al., 2014) demonstrated an obvious lack of
documentation of inversions, especially for small inversions (1 bp to
around 100 bp). This is inconsistent with previous suggestions that
small SVs are much more frequent in the genome than large SVs
(Conrad et al., 2008; Hurles et al., 2008), suggesting that the major—
ity of inversions might remain to be identified.

Several computational methods are available to detect SVs based
on short read sequencing data, most of which have the function for
inversion detection (Chen et al., 2009; He et al., 2016; Rausch et al.,
2012; Trappe et al., 2014; Ye et al., 2009). But only one (Trappe
et al., 2014) of these tools was designed specifically for detecting
short inversions. Most of these tools rely on signals of inconsistent
mapping directions of the reads in a read pair in paired—end sequenc—
ing (Chen et al., 2009; Rausch et al., 2012), which requires both
reads of the pair to be mappable to the reference genome and one
read to almost entirely overlap with the inversion. As a consequence,
this limits the minimum length of inversions that can be detected to
at least longer than the read length. Software such as Pindel (Ye
et al., 2009) tries to solve this problem by combining paired-end
method with split—read method, which makes it possible to detect

inversions that are shorter than the read length. However, by requir—
ing at least one end of the read to be mapped to the reference gen—
ome to serve as an anchor, it loses power in detecting certain
inversions such as those adjacent to other complex SVs or repeat re—
gions, which are common for inversions as reported previously
(Stankiewicz and Lupski, 2010) and in this study.

Here we introduce SRinversion, a framework that applies a split
read method on next—generation sequencing (NGS) data to detect in—
versions smaller than 1kb. Instead of relying only on mapped reads
as anchors, SRinversion also makes use of poorly mapped or un—
mapped reads, splits or inverts them, and then re—aligns them to the
reference genome to detect inversions (Fig. 1). By considering the
unmapped reads, which are overlooked for inversion detection by
other tools, the sensitivity of inversion detection is improved signifi-
cantly. This is because for short inversions, especially those shorter
than the read length, most of the reads covering them are usually
poorly mapped or unmapped.

Gustaf (Trappe et al., 2014) and MID (He et al., 2016) also try
to use poorly mapped reads to generate split—map contigs for short
inversion detection. However, the sensitivities of these methods are
affected by their pre—requisites such as requiring both ends of each
read be mapped to the reference genome with high confidence.

We applied SRinversion to both simulated data and real data
from a parent-child trio from the 1000 Genomes Project. Pindel,
BreakDancer, DELLY, Gustaf and MID were also applied on both
datasets and the results were compared. A better performance for
SRinversion was achieved on both datasets, especially for small
inversions.

Fig. 1. SRinversion workflow by different scenarios. Step 1: Extract poorly mapped reads. In scenario 1, reads partially covering inversion region and marked as
soft clipped by BWA are extracted, and in scenario 2, reads covering the whole inversion region and considered unmapped are extracted. Step 2: Split reads. In
scenario 1, each extracted read will be split into two segments at different split sites, and in scenario 2, for each read, sequence within windows of different sizes
at different sites will be changed into reverse complement sequence. Step 3: Re-map reads. Segment generated from step 2 are aligned back to the reference and
only segment pairs or segments that are exactly matched are selected for step 4. Step 4: Inversion region detection. Each matched segment or segment pair from
step 3 produces a start and end position of the inversion it covers, and by merging those positions from different reads, inversion region can be determined

SRinversion

 

2 Approach
SRinversion consists of four major steps:
extract unmapped reads and reads with low mapping quality

split or invert reads
re-map reads

detect inversion region

Particularly two scenarios are considered based on the predicted
relationships between candidate reads and corresponding inversions,
and different algorithms are applied in the following steps accord—
ingly (Fig. 1).

Specifically, in scenario 1, a read is assumed to partially overlap
with an inversion, and one end of the read cannot be mapped to the
reference genome and hence is marked as ‘clipping’ in alignment by
tools such as BWA (Li and Durbin, 2009). In this case, SRinversion
would (1) extract the clipped reads as candidates, (2) splits each can—
didate read into pairs of segments at different sites along the read,
(3) re—align the split segments from step (2) to the reference genome
to detect the primary start and end positions of a corresponding in-
version and (4) integrate position information from step (3) from all
candidate reads covering the same inversion and to count the num—
ber of reads supporting the inversion.

In scenario 2, we assume that the candidate read encompasses
the entire inversion, giving rise to an inverted sequence in the middle
of the read, and these reads are thus most likely to be marked as ‘un—
mapped’ after the initial alignment by most of mapping algorithms.
To deal with this situation, (1) all unmapped reads are extracted re—
gardless of the status of their read pairs and (2) the middle part of
these extracted reads are inverted into reverse complement se—
quences at different positions using a sliding window with pre—set
window and step sizes. These modified reads are then realigned to
reference human genome and the alignment information are inte-
grated for inversion detection, using procedures similar to Step (3)
and (4) described above for scenario 1.

SRinversion tries to include all poorly mapped and unmapped
reads to increase sensitivity in inversion detection. Two key points
make SRinversion better at detecting short inversions than existing SV
calling methods: (1) SRinversion extracts all clipped or unmapped
reads as candidate reads regardless of the mapping status of their
mate pairs. Software like Pindel and Gustaf also uses clipped reads for
SV calling. However, these methods require the mate pair of the
clipped reads be mapped to the reference genome with high quality,
which may result in exclusion of some informative reads that don’t
fulfill this criterion. This is especially the case when coverage or qual—
ity of the analyzed data is low or the inversion region is located in or
near complex regions in human genome. SRinversion tries to solve
this problem by considering every single read regardless of situations
with its mate pair to ensure inclusion of all potential informative reads
and tries to increase specificity by applying additional filtering steps.
(2) In scenario 2, unmapped reads, either with one end or both ends
unmapped, are analyzed, making it possible to detect inversions so
short as to invert only the middle part of the sequences of the reads
involved, which are likely to be missed by the existing methods.

3 Materials and methods

3.1 Overview of SRinversion

3.1.1 Extracting poorly mapped reads

SRinversion accepts binary aligned reads in BAM format (Li and
Durbin, 2009) as input, which include all the original sequencing reads
with alignment quality parameters. In scenario 1 (Fig. 1), reads with

nbp clipped sequences on either end are obtained regardless of map—
ping status of their mates, where n needs to be above 5. In scenario 2
(Fig. 1), all unmapped reads, either one or both reads of a pair labeled
as unmapped, are collected as candidate reads for further analysis.

3.1.2 Split or convert reads

Reads extracted from the above step are split or inverted at different
positions. Specifically, in scenario 1, each candidate read is split at
site i, where i E k, . . ., m — k and m is the read length, [a is the pre—set
start position for splitting. In this study, [a was set to 20 bp since seg—
ments smaller than 20 bp are unlikely to be mapped uniquely and
properly to reference human genome. In scenario 2, a sliding win-
dow with length w bp and step size 5 bp is applied from position [a
to position m—k—w, where w E k, ..., m — k and m and k are the
same as in scenario 1. Here 5 was set to 5 as a compromise between
computing time and detection resolution. Within each window, se—
quences are converted into their reverse complement sequences.

3.1.3 Re-map reads

All segments generated from the steps described above are re—
aligned to human reference genome (hg19) using the same (single
ended) model from BWA (version 0.7.5a—r405), with the maximum
number of alignments output for each read set to 3 as a default.

3.1.4 Inversion region detection

After realignment for each read, the segment or the segment pair
that can be uniquely mapped and with mapping quality 230 is se—
lected for inferring the boundaries of the potential inversions. In
addition, in scenario 1, the orientation of each segment pair has to
be opposite of each other. Afterwards, reads covering the same in-
version are merged to get the depth information for further filtra-
tion. In most cases, there would be several base pair deviation on the
inversion boundaries derived from different reads, likely due to
mapping errors. To be more inclusive, the most extensive coordin—
ates for each inversion are selected.

3.2 Validating the detected inversions by long reads
data and PCR

Long read data were used to measure the accuracy of inversion de—
tection on real data. Long—read sequencing data from PacBio or
Illumina Moleculo platforms are available for sample NA12878, re—
ported by Layer et al. (2014) and in (https://github.com/hall—lab/
long—read—validation). For results from the long reads data, inver—
sions smaller than 1Mbp were included, which were detected using
parameters such as at least 1 Moleculo split read or at least 2 PacBio
split reads, and a slop of 5, as suggested by the original method. In
addition, PCR experiment was also conducted on a few detected in—
versions that are not located near repeats or repetitive sequences.

4 Results

4.1 Datasets

4.1.1 Simulated data

To evaluate the performance of SRinversion, we simulated inversions
on human chromosome 21 based on reference human genome hg19.
These data were used to examine how well SRinversion and the exist—
ing methods perform in detecting the inversions in the presence of
SNPs, indels and sequencing errors. First, RSVSim (version 1.6.1)
(Bartenhagen and Dugas, 2013) was used for generation of inversions
ranging from 5 bp to 1 kb (Supplementary Table S1). The fraction of
SNPs within the flanking regions of inversions was simulated as 0.

001. Then ART_illumina version 2.1.8 (Huang et al., 2012) was used
to generate illumina pair—end reads with 101 bp read length and 250
bp mean insert size and an average coverage of 100 fold.

In order to test the effect of coverage on detection accuracy, we
simulated sequencing reads with average coverage depth at 4x, 8 X,
16x, 32x, 64x and 128x, respectively, using the same parameters
described above. To generate heterozygous inversions, reads simu—
lated directly from the reference genome were merged with reads
with simulated inversions, each constitute half of the total reads and
the coverage was the same as those of the corresponding datasets
with homozygous inversions (Supplementary Fig. S2).

4.1.2 Real data

We also tested our SRinversion and the three existing methods on
whole—genome paired—end Illumina sequencing dataset on a CEU
HapMap trio from the 1000 Genomes Project. Only data from
chromosome 1 and chromosome 21 were used due to the high com—
putational demand running genome—wide analysis. The data have a
read length of 101 bp. Data for NA12878 (the daughter) have a 128
fold average sequencing coverage with a mean insert size 417 bp.
Data on NA12891 (the father) have a 69 fold sequencing coverage
with a mean insert size 328 bp. And data for individual NA12892
(the mother) have a 68 fold sequencing coverage with a mean insert
size 326 bp. Aligned reads were downloaded from the ftp site of the
1000 Genomes Project (ftp://ftp—trace.ncbi.nih.gov/1000genomes/
ftp/technical/working/20 120 1 1 7_ceu_trio_b3 7_decoy/)

In addition to the public dataset, we also used two whole—
genome paired—end sequencing datasets generated from two differ—
ent platforms. These data include: (1) Illumina HiSeq X10 sequenc—
ing with 35x coverage, a mean insert size of 566 bp and a read
length 150 bp and (2) Illumina MiSeq sequencing with 7x sequenc—
ing coverage, a mean insert size of 521 bp and a read length 300 bp,
both for a single individual (Supplementary Table S4). For the

Illumina MiSeq data, the insert size is smaller than the sum of the
two reads in a pair (Supplementary Fig. S6a), allowing sequencing
overlap for the paired reads. PEAR version 0.9.6 (Zhang et al.,
2014) was used to connect the paired reads and we compared this
dataset with the original datasets described above. After connection
of the paired reads, the maximum read length was increased from
301 bp to 592 bp. Since PEAR tried to select bases with higher qual—
ity scores for the overlapped regions, after connection, the base qual—
ities around the 3’ ends of the reads were also significantly improved
(Supplementary Fig. S6b).

4.2 Performance on simulated inversions

In order to evaluate the performance of SRinversion, we first simu-
lated inversions ranging from 5 bp to 1kb on sequences from human
chromosome 21, in the presence of SNPs, indels and sequencing
errors (see Section 3 for details). Five published methods, i.e.
BreakDancer version 1.1, DELLY version 0.3.3, Pindel version
0.2.5 a3, Gustaf version 1.0.0 and MID were also applied to the data
for comparison (see supplementary for details).

4.2.1 Sensitivity and specificity (Table 1 and Fig. 2)

Specificity was defined as percentage of detected inversions over—
lapped with inversion regions from simulation over all inversions de—
tected by each method. Sensitivity was defined as percentage of
inversions that are detected by each method among all inversions
generated in simulation. SRinversion achieved both high sensitivity
and specificity for the various inversion lengths (Table 1) on the
simulated data. The performance of BreakDancer was high for in-
versions longer than 5 00 bp, while worsened quickly when the in-
versions became shorter (Table 1). As seen from the table,
BreakDancer could not detect any inversions smaller than 50 bp,
which was also the case for DELLY. Sensitivity of DELLY was high
for inversions longer than 100 bp, while specificity was lower

Gustaf and MID were applied to compare the sensitivity and specificity under
different coverage. Depth cutoff of 2x and 5x were applied for SRinversion.
For MID, only inversions with length 3100 bp were included for evaluation
since the method can only detect inversions smaller than read length

relative to that of other methods. Pindel had the best performance
among the five published methods for small inversions. Gustaf could
detect inversions from 20 bp to 1 kb, but had high variation in per-
formance among different categories. MID, as stated in the paper,
could not detect inversions longer than read length, i.e. 100 bp. And
for inversions smaller than 100 bp, MID showed acceptable specifi—
city but rather low sensitivity (Table 1).

Different coverage depths were simulated in the data to test the ef—
fect of coverage on detection sensitivity and specificity (Fig. 2). In gen-
eral, specificity tends to be more stable for various coverage depth.
And except for DELLY and Gustaf, sensitivity of all methods con—
verged to their respective highest levels when coverage reached 40><
for heterozygous and 20x for homozygous inversions. SRinversion
was tested with different cutoff for minimum number of supporting
reads for one inversion to be output since depth plays important role
for the performance of SRinversion. When average coverage is higher
than 40><, higher depth cutoff (removing low coverage regions)
increased the specificity without significantly affecting sensitivity.
While for data with lower coverage overall, using higher depth as cut—
off gained higher specificity but at the cost of sensitivity. These results
indicate that a 5x to 10x threshold requirement would be recom—
mended to balance specificity and sensitivity in inversion detection.

Both heterozygous and homozygous inversions were simulated for
all datasets described above. Performance for detecting homozygous in-
versions was slightly better than for heterozygous ones for all methods
and all inversion lengths. Sensitivity of detecting homozygous inversions
equals that for heterozygous ones at almost half of the coverage level,
indicating that the different performance between detecting heterozy—
gous and homozygous inversions is largely an issue of the number of
supporting reads, with and without reads for another allele.

4.2.2 Efficiency (Fig. 3)

Figure 3 shows the computing times and memory usage for the simu—
lated datasets with different levels of coverage. Memory usage for
SRinversion, BreakDancer and MID was little affected by the in—
crease in coverage depth, different from that for Pindel, DELLY and
Gustaf. Computing times of all the methods were approximately lin-
ear with coverage but with different slope. Among them, DELLY
and MID were the fastest for all coverage levels, both of which input
information for all reads from the onset, leading to reduced

depth 25 cutoff was applied for SRinversion

computing time at the cost of high memory usage when coverage
was high. SRinversion was slower than BreakDancer, DELLY,
Gustaf and MID, especially when coverage was high, which was
probably because it processed all poorly mapped and unmapped
reads to extract sequences that might harbor inversions. Pindel also
scans all poorly mapped and unmapped reads and has the highest
computing time demand with a high but stable memory usage.

4.3 Application to real data

4.3.1 Inversion detection on a CEU trio

SRinversion was also used on high—coverage sequencing data on
chromosome 1 and chromosome 21 of a European parent—child trio
(NA12878, NA12891 and NA12892) from the 1000 Genomes
Project. In total, 262, 42 and 38 inversions were detected on
NA12878, NA12891 and NA12892, respectively (Supplementary
Table S2). The relatively smaller number of inversions detected in
parents (NA12891 and NA12892) could probably be explained by
the fact that a depth 210 cutoff was applied here to reduce false
positives, which might have caused omission of certain regions that
are not covered well in parents, as the coverage depth for the parents
was only half of that for the daughter.

For comparison, BreakDancer, DELLY and Pindel were also
used on the data from chromosome 21. Unlike for simulated data,
the numbers of inversions detected by the three published methods
were insignificant: 2, 2 and 4 inversions were detected by
BreakDancer, DELLY and Pindel, respectively (Supplementary
Table S3), all of which were also detected by SRinversion. What is
more, none of the three methods detected inversions smaller than
100 bp. An inversion detected from NA12878 by BreakDancer that
was reported to be 38 bp turned out to be longer than 500 bp upon
further examination (Supplementary Table S3). Gustaf and MID
were also tested on chromosome 21, however, both of them were
not able to detect any inversions smaller than 1 kb.

4.4 Validating selected inversions by long—read data and
PCR experiments

Selected inversions detected for NA12878 were compared to results
from https://github.com/hall—lab/long—read—validation, which is

based on long reads data on the same individual sample. In general,
59.54% of the inversions detected by SRinversion were also re—
ported from long read data. Specifically, 129 of the 192 inversions
in chromosome 1 and 27 of the 70 inversions in chromosome 21
were detected by PacBio/Moleculo data (see Supplementary Table
S2 for details). All the currently available methods for SV detection
have negligible detection of the inversions on NA12878 and were
not compared here.

For primer design and PCR, definitive sequence information was
required and the validation process was limited to the regions not
located within or near repetitive or repeat sequences (Supplementary
Fig. S3). For the filtering criteria please refer to supplementary
method section 2. Five inversions were selected for PCR validation.
Four of the five inversion regions were validated by sequencing of
the PCR amplicons, while the fifth one failed PCR amplification due
to a repeat region nearby that was not detected in the filtering
process.

4.5 Effect of read length on inversion detection

To test the effect of read length on inversion detection, three differ-
ent types of data from a single sample were used. They are (1) short
reads: whole—genome paired—end sequencing data with read length
at 150 bp, depth of 35x from Illumina HiSeq X10, (2) long reads:
whole—genome paired—end sequencing data with read length at 300
bp, depth of 7x from Illumina MiSeq and (3) connected long reads:
connected long reads from dataset (2) (Supplementary Fig. S6a).
Both SRinversion and three other methods, i.e. BreakDancer,
DELLY and Pindels, were tested on the three datasets
(Supplementary Fig. S5 a). For dataset (3), since the two paired reads
were connected to convert the paired reads into a single read, the
data can no longer be processed by the three public tools that re—
quire paired—end data and insert size information as input. As shown
in Supplementary Figure S5 a, there are relatively more inversions de—
tected using short reads (dataset 1) than using long reads (dataset 2)
for all four programs, which might be largely due to the differences
in coverage depth of the two datasets. When long reads were con—
nected to make the read length close to 590 bp on average,
SRinversion detected more inversions from the connected long
reads, even with a much lower coverage depth (~9><) than from
the short reads (~35 ><), indicating a significant improvement in in-
version detection when longer reads are available (Supplementary
Fig. 85b).

5 Discussion

Among the different types of genetic variants, such as SNVs, indels
(insertions and deletions shorter than 50 bp), SVs (insertions, dele—
tions, inversions, etc. longer than 50 bp) and complex regions (such
as those with duplications, repeats and repetitive sequences), inver—
sions shorter than 50 bp are probably the most overlooked variant
type. And summary of public database of SVs does suggest inad—
equacy of methods in detecting inversions shorter than 50 bp
(Supplementary Fig. S1).

SRinversion tries to fill the gap by focusing exclusively on detect—
ing short inversions. By splitting sequencing reads, algorithm for
scenario 1 focuses on inversions from 20 bp to 500 bp, while by in—
verting the sequences in the middle of the reads, algorithm for scen-
ario 2 aims at detecting inversions smaller than 20 bp, with a
resolution up to 4 bp. An important characteristic of SRinversion is
that it makes use of reads with low mapping quality and unmapped
reads, which are overlooked by most available methods in SV

detection using NGS data. By making use of the poorly mapped
reads, more inversions, especially those smaller than 50 bp that are
likely to be located in the middle of sequencing reads and interrupt
alignment of the reads can still be detected.

Currently available tools were developed primarily to deal with
paired—end reads, which have been the dominant data type for most
sequencing platforms so far. However, with the rapid development
of new sequencing platforms and especially the advances of the third
generation sequencing technologies, new methods like SRinversion
that can deal with newer types of sequencing data as well as existing
paired—end reads are useful tools in our arsenal to detect structural
variants. MID also tried to generate segments from single reads with
no pair-end information, which is similar to the process for scenario
2 in SRinversion. But only focusing on one of the aspects limited the
length of inversions the method can detect to 30—100 bp. And apply—
ing limitations such as requiring anchors for both ends of a read and
reads covering entirely the targeted inversions significantly reduced
the power of the method.

SRinversion itself cannot detect inversions at nucleotide reso—
lution, but with implementation of external assembly methods, i.e.
velvet and BLAST to map the inferred inversion contigs back to ref—
erence genome, the resolution can reach 1—2 bp.

Comparison of WGS short reads with read length 150 bp and
long reads with read length longer than 500 bp emphasized the po—
tential power increase by longer read length for SRinversion.
Notably more inversions were detected using connected reads with
average read length longer than 500 bp, even when the coverage
depth (9><) is much lower than that by the short reads (35 x), sug—
gesting that read length might be a determining factor over sequenc—
ing depth for inversion detection. Thus increasing read length
whenever possible, such as by connecting two reads of a read pair
when the insert size is smaller than the sum of the read length, might
be beneficial for inversion detection using SRinversion. It is noted
that this is based on a small sample and further studies are needed to
explore the data types most suited for SV detection.

Inversions, especially smaller ones, often occur around complex
regions in human genome such as short repeat regions, as found in
the CEU trio in this study. As shown in this analysis, of the 262 in-
versions detected in chromosome 1 and chromosome 21 from
NA12878, only five were located in regions without complex se—
quences (Supplementary Fig. S3). Thus more accurate detection of
inversions might hinge upon a better understanding of these com—
plex regions in human genome, which are highly variable among in-
dividuals and populations.

Checking the detailed location of inversions detected from the
sample with three different types of data using SRinversion, we dem—
onstrated that around 96% of the detected inversions are located
around repeat regions (Supplementary Fig. S5c), which is consistent
with findings on samples from the 1000 Genomes Project. This sug—
gests a strong association between inversions and repetitive se—
quences in human genome, which might be resulted from the
intrinsic characteristics of these regions in which inversions are
more likely to occur. It is also possible that repetitive regions in—
crease sequencing and mapping errors that may produce false posi—
tive signals.

To resolve these issues, inversion breakpoints reported by long—
read sequencing data from PacBio and Moleculo platforms were
used for comparison. And 5 9.54% of the inversions called by
SRinversion were validated by these long—read data. The 40% inver—
sions not also detected by LUMPY using PacBio/Moleculo data
could be either false positives from SRinversion or false negatives
from LUMPY results. SRinversion focuses on detecting inversions

smaller than 100bp, while LUMPY tries to integrate signals from
different datasets and calls a variety of structural variants of all
ranges (Supplementary Fig. S7). And it is apparent that more data
and studies are needed to further increase the sensitivity and specific—
ities of inversion detection.

Due to the painstaking process of recovering poorly mapped or
unmapped reads, inverse partial sequences for further alignment in
order to increase the sensitivity of inversion detection, SRinversion
has not achieved the efficiency needed to process a large amount of
whole genome sequencing data. It seems that limitations in read
length, coverage depth and poor understanding of the complex re—
gions in human genome also prevented a more powerful perform—
ance from SRinversion. At this moment, application of SRinversion
on targeted sequencing data seems to be a more feasible practice.
However, the algorithm provided here and the initial findings in ap-
plication of SRinversion have laid the foundation for further devel—
opment in this area. Complete understanding of the correlations
between genotypes and human diseases will rely on our capacity to
detect all variants accurately in human genome, including inver-
sions. Thus SRinversion is a timely development in this effort.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Atomistic or coarse grained (CG) potentials derived from
statistical distributions of internal variables have recently become
popular due to the need of simplified interactions for reaching larger
scales in simulations or more efficient conformational space sampling.
However, the process of parameterization of accurate and predictive
statistics-based force fields requires a huge amount of work and is
prone to the introduction of bias and errors.

Results: This article introduces SecStAnT, a software for the cre-
ation and analysis of protein structural datasets with user-defined pri-
mary/secondary structure composition, with a particular focus on the
CG representation. In addition, the possibility of managing different
resolutions and the primary/secondary structure selectivity allow ad-
dressing the mapping-backmapping of atomistic to CG representation
and study the secondary to primary structure relations. Sample data-
sets and distributions are reported, including interpretation of struc-
tural features.

Availability and implementation: SecStAnT is available free of
charge at secstant.sourceforge.net/. Source code is freely available
on request, implemented in Java and supported on Linux, MS
Windows and OSX.

1 INTRODUCTION

Molecular dynamics (MD) computer simulations, and more spe-
ciﬁcally force ﬁeld (FF)-based atomistic MD (Adcock and
McCammon, 2006), are considered invaluable tools to get insight
in the structure and function of biological matter. Within this
approach, the inter-atomic interactions are represented by means
of a sum of analytical terms, whose parameters were optimized in
the course of the past decades, based on quantum chemistry
calculations or experimental data. This approach is implemented
in a number of widely used software packages (van Gunsteren,
1996; Jorgensen et al., 1996; Vanommeslaeghe et al., 2010; Wang
et al., 2004).

Despite its undoubted utility, the atomistic MD presents some
weaknesses. Single proteins simulations can now reach the

sub-,us scale with ordinary computational resources. However,
most biologically interesting phenomena occur on wider time
and space scales, needing large parallelism. This problem is not
likely to be simply resolved by the increase of the processors
power and of parallelism, becoming increasingly harder as the
system complexity grows. Recent efforts have focused on the
development of dedicated hardware. An example is the super-
computer Anton (Shaw et al., 2008), which implements specia-
lized hardware for protein dynamics, leading to simulation time
scales into the range of hundreds of micro seconds to millisec-
onds. However, such systems are not broadly available to the
scientiﬁc community. A second problem of the atomistic ap-
proach is related to the model itself. As longer time scales are
explored in the simulations, the traditional FFs show inaccura-
cies especially in the evaluation of the relative energies of differ-
ent secondary structures (Freddolino et al., 2008; Lindorff-
Larsen et al., 2012). A great effort is currently in the course to
produce a new generation of FFs to fix these problems, although
this task appears hard without the introduction of more complex
interactions with larger number of parameters (Chaudret et al.,
2013; Zhao et al., 2010). This, in turn, worsens a problem already
existing in the traditional FFs, i.e. the complexity of the opti-
mization procedure.

Apparently paradoxically, the reductionist approach has re-
cently been considered as a possible alternative. Minimizing the
number of parameters of the model allows applying more efﬁ-
cient parameters optimization strategies to accurately reproduce
given properties. Direct emanations of this approach are the
coarse grained (CG) models, representing group of atoms with
single interacting centers (beads) (Tozzini, 2005) and the so called
“knowledge based’ or statistical potentials (SP) (Tadmor et al.,
2011), i.e. potentials with a relatively small number of param-
eters, derived by the statistical analysis of the increasingly larger
experimental structures databases. CG models solve directly the
first class of problems, as they immediately reduce the computa-
tional cost of orders of magnitude. On the other hand, SPs,
though bearing many limitations specifically residing in the dif-
ficulty of combining transferability and predictive power with
structural accuracy (Vendruscolo and Domany, 1998), have
shown better performance than traditional atomistic FFs for
docking or homology modeling applications (Poole and
Ranganathan, 2006).

The combination of CG with SPs has been used in models for
MD simulations, such as MARTINI (Marrink et al., 2007),

representing the amino acid at an intermediate resolution level
(with 2—6 beads), embedded in CG explicit water, or the one by
Bahar and J ernigan, with a similar resolution but with implicit
water(Jernigan and Bahar, 1996), or the one developed by us
(Tozzini et al., 2006), based on a single bead per amino acid
(placed on Coc) in implicit water. This resolution level can be
considered the minimal where internal variables can still expli-
citly describe secondary structures, and therefore called
‘minimalist’ .

Speciﬁcally referring to minimalist models (Tozzini, 2010a),
different algorithms were considered to produce SPs, such as
direct or iterative Boltzmann inversion (BI) (Reith et al., 2003),
relative entropy minimization (Chaimovich and Shell, 2011) and
reverse Monte Carlo (Lyubartsev and Laaksonen, 1995). They
all rely on the statistical distributions of the internal variables,
either used as direct input or as target quantity for the potential
optimization. This implies that the quality of statistical distribu-
tion determines the accuracy of the model (Trovato and Tozzini,
2012). In turn, the quality of the statistical distribution is deter-
mined by the statistical relevance of the dataset (i.e. number and
diversity of included structures) and its composition in terms of
sequence or secondary structures. The latter in particular is rele-
vant for the parameterization of potentials capable of accurately
reproducing the secondary structure tendency of different amino
acids.

The RSCB Protein Data Bank (PDB) (Rose et al., 2013), the
most comprehensive database of biomolecular—and speciﬁcally
proteins—structures, is the natural source of data for building
statistical sets and corresponding probability distributions.
Biomolecules coordinates are stored in a format that is a
widely used, internationally referred representation for
macromolecular data, including experimental and structural in-
formation. These, however, are integrated within the coordinates
ﬁle, and not of immediate use to the aim of building, e. g. primary
or secondary structure-dependent dataset.

In this article, we describe and validate SecStAnT, a tool with
an intuitive and sleek interface able to automatically create from
PDB user-deﬁned datasets of protein structural composition or
primary sequence motives at different levels of resolution (atom-
istic or CG). Furthermore, a large number of internal variable
distributions can be evaluated together with two and three body
correlation functions. The latter point is particularly innovative
and useful for the parameterization and validation of the CG
models. In fact, the correlation map between the internal vari-
ables describing the backbone conformation within the CG rep-
resentation has the same role of the well-known Ramachandran
plot (Tozzini et al., 2006). Although there are a number of tools
to evaluate the latter [for instance (Gopalakrishnan et al., 2007)],
to our knowledge, none are freely available to evaluate the cor-
responding correlation maps within the minimalist representa-
tions. The ability to evaluate the SP by means of BI facilitates
the parameterization process of CG models. In addition, the
possibility to consider both atomistic and CG resolutions
allows in principle to directly make connections between the
two levels. This is particularly important in view of generating
CG models fully compatible with atomistic FFs to be included in
a coherent multiscale representation, which are often considered
as possible solutions to combine the advantages of CG and

atomistic representation and eliminate their disadvantages
(Colombo and Micheletti, 2005; Tozzini, 2010b).

We illustrate SecStAnT and its potentialities reporting sample
datasets distributions and correlations. Interesting novel features
emerge from this statistical analysis to which we give a physical-
chemical interpretation.

2 METHODS
2.1 Model deﬁnition

Three typical resolution levels used to represent a protein model are re-
ported in Figure 1: (i) the fully atomistic; (ii) the ‘backbone—only’ and (iii)
the ‘minimalist’ (Coc only). In the latter case, the internal variables deﬁn-
ing the backbone conformation are the bond angle 6 between three
subsequent Cocs and the dihedral (p between four subsequent Cocs (see
Fig. 1C). These are the homologues of the (I) and III dihedrals deﬁned
within the atomistic representation of the backbone. Consequently, the
(6, (p) correlation map can be considered the homolog of the
Ramachandran plot, which is, in fact, the (<1), 1I!) correlation map
(Tozzini et al., 2006). Other important internal variables, which are rele-
vant to the CG representation and speciﬁcally to the minimalist one, are
the distances between Coc in general, and speciﬁcally those separated by a
given number of amino acids (i.e. r14, r15, . . .). SecStAnT is able to treat
every custom subset of atoms, including atomistic (A), minimalist (C) and
also intermediate representation, such as the (B) and others. Because the
main focus is on the minimalist, a large number of distribution calcula-
tions for the minimalist representation are implemented.

2.2 Statistical analysis and normalization

Three classes of statistics calculations are available: single variable distri-
butions, two- and three-variables correlation maps (hereafter 2D and 3D
maps). A list of distributions and correlations is represented in Table 1.
Single variables distributions can be done of any of the deﬁned internal
variables, and in some cases of their complementary (e.g. the distribution
of ‘non—bonded’ beads, which are the complementary of the r131“, . . . ,
riai+3 with respect to the set of all rid-s). The primary output data are the
non-normalized occurrences, i.e. the ANs:

AN,‘ 2 N(X1)A.Xi 
Z N(Xi)Axi = Nlol (2)

with Ntot the total number of occurrences of a given variable within the
dataset and Ax, is the width of the histogram intervals (bins). Besides the
raw data ANi, additional differently normalized are of interest. One is the
normalized relative occurrence, tending to the probability distribution in
the Ax, —>0, ANi—>oo limit

In addition, especially to the aim of using the distribution for the FFs
parameterization, it is often useful to separate the purely geometric effect
deﬁning

_ P (Xi) _ N (Xi)
_ P0060 _ N0(Xi)

 

 

F(x,-) (4)
where N0 (P0) is the probability distribution in the non-interacting par-
ticles system (ideal gas), which can be evaluated analytically in some
cases. For instance, if x is rijj, then N0 is the number of uniformly dis-
tributed particles at distance r from a given one, and one has

NO)

N00) O< p4m2 F0) O< p4m2 = g(r) (5)

 

where g(r) is called the pair distribution function and contains the same
information as P or N but, having the ideal part extracted, reﬂects spe-
ciﬁcally the effect of the interactions. The g(r) here deﬁned with N0 = 4M2
is the one corresponding to the ideal inﬁnite gas, with standard normal-
ization [g(r)—> 1 for r—> 00]. However, when applied to ﬁnite size sys-
tems, it brings uneven behavior of g(r), making it vanishing at large r
values. Besides the standard normalization, two additional are imple-
mented accounting for the ﬁnite size of the proteins:

N0 (r) 2 Cry (6)

New =  — (2) e + (2) e] m
where in Equation (6), y~1.5, ﬁtted on a statistical dataset of large pro-
teins (Zhou and Zhou, 2002). The normalization in Equation (7) corres-
ponds to the distribution of the ideal gas conﬁned in a sphere of radius R,
analytically evaluated (reducing to N0 = [)4an for small r). This normal-
ization works well if the proteins in the dataset are not excessively dis-
persed, R being their average gyration radius (Tozzini, 2010a).

Another noticeable case of non-trivial N0 is the bond angle, for which
N0(6)o<sin(6). In any case, the ANi, the Ps and the PS are given in the
output (see the Supplementary Material for additional details).

Two variables (2D) and three variables (3D) maps are implemented for
combinations of variables particularly relevant to the secondary structure
analysis. Included in this list, there are the (6, (p) map for the Coc repre-
sentation, and the (<1), 1I!) (Ramachandran plot) for the backbone-only
representation. In this case, the output is only the AN,, and the same
normalized to its maximum value, which is a convenient normalization
for visualization of 2D and 3D maps.

2.3 Potentials generation and other applications

Statistical distributions can be used for the generation of the FFs, specif-
ically in the case of the minimalist model. A commonly used representa-
tion of the FFs for these models is (Tozzini, 2010a; Trovato and Tozzini,
2012):

U = U17 + U6 + Uq) + Uloc + Unloc 

where U1OC and Unomoc are the local and non-local parts of the non-
bonded interactions. Depending on the model, the separation between
U1OC and Unomloc can be based either on physical-chemical criteria, or on
geometrical-structural criteria or a combination of them (Tozzini et al.,
2007). In any case, at least the riai+n distances with i=4,5,6 are usually
included in the local part, thus an expansion of the FFs terms reads:

Ub =  “12(71', 1+1)

U9 =  “6(61')
U¢ =  ”¢(¢i) (9)
Uloc = 2 “10C, n(ri, i+n)
1', 11:4, 5, 6
Unloc = Z unloc(ri,j)
i,j>i+6

A rough ﬁrst approximation to evaluate FF terms of a given internal
variable is to consider the potential of mean force, namely:

N(x) )
N 000

 

w(x) = —len P(x) % —len ( (10)

where x is any of the variables on which the FF terms depend, [CT the
Boltzmann factor. This is deﬁned the BI and gives an operative way to
evaluate numerically the interactions in a system on statistical basis (the
numerical w can subsequently be ﬁtted with an analytical form). w(x) can
be obtained with a single passage from Equation (4) and is delivered in
the output ﬁles.

3 RESULTS
3.1 Workflow

The program is roughly composed of two modules, as described
in Figure 2. The ﬁrst one, the parsing module, performs the
dataset building, extracting structures from PDB and fragment-
ing them in elements with deﬁned secondary structures. The
input selection is performed through a graphical interface by
combining secondary structure information with any other selec-
tion criterion available on the Research Collaboratory for
Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB) advanced search interface as,
for instance, the experimental method for the structure determin-
ation, the release year and so forth. The downloading process is
performed through RCSB FTP interface, according to the server
guidelines; a cache mechanism is implemented to avoid multiple
downloads of a single entry. As anticipated, the queries consist of
secondary structures composition and sequence motifs.
Secondary structures can be selected either based on the infor-
mation included into the PDB ﬁle itself (provided by the PDB
ﬁle author) (Berman et al., 2003) or on the DSSP ﬁle [provided
by RSCB and based on the DSSP algorithm (Andersen et al.,
2002)]. Secondary structures identiﬁed by the two algorithms are
listed in Supplementary Table S1 in the Supplementary Material.
Primary structure is deﬁned by standard regular expression
search. During the extraction process, information on primary,
secondary and super-secondary structures (when available) is
mined and stored. Either the whole proteins or only the structure

Fig. 2. Schematic illustration of the SecStAnT workﬂow. The process is
separated in two modules. In the parsing module, input data are down-
loaded and processed by a thread pool. Each entry is fragmented by user-
deﬁned primary and secondary structure criterions. In the analysis
module, each fragment is then saved separately and a series of statistics
is calculated

fragments with the selected secondary structure can be stored in
hierarchical organized folders for future consultation (see
Supplementary Material for the detailed description of the
output dataset organization). In the analysis module, the frag-
ments dataset is used to build different kinds of distributions of
internal variables and their correlations. A description of the
statistical analysis process as well as sample distributions and
correlations are discussed below. The output format (described
in detail in the Supplementary Material) is given in numerical
form, conveniently readable by a large number of commonly
used graphics software packages.

3.2 Structural dataset

Two sample datasets were built, one for 0t helical fragments and
one for unstructured fragments. Each dataset was separated in

two subsets of X-ray crystallographic and nuclear magnetic res-
onance (NMR)-derived structures, although only distributions of
X-ray data are shown (the others are given in the Supplementary
Material). For each database query, search results were ﬁltered
by the RCSB server on the basis of a similarity threshold of 30%.
To further limit the unstructured dataset size, we additionally
selected those entries released after the year 2001. The data
were saved at the ‘minimalist’ resolution level. The search re-
sulted in a total of 16 400 structures for the X-ray 0t helical struc-
tures, 3550 for NMR 0t helical, 11672 for X-ray unstructured
and 3839 for NMR unstructured. Detailed RCSB queries are
reported in Supplementary Material.

3.3 Internal variables distribution

Sample distributions and maps evaluated on the datasets
described in the previous section are here reported. Figure 3
reports the single variable distributions (evaluated on X-ray
datasets).

The difference between red and black lines reﬂects the second-
ary structure difference, the black lines representing the oc—helices
dataset and the red lines the unstructured proteins dataset. For
the helices, the local variables distributions of (6, (p, r123 and r14)
are single peaked and little dispersed, the signature of the local
order. In particular, the oc—helix is characterized by 6~91 deg,
o~50 deg. Conversely, those of the unstructured proteins are
multimodal and more disordered.

The distribution of the non-bonded distances (Fig. 3D) shows
similar differences concerning the comparison between helical
and unstructured datasets, although the distribution itself in
both cases is more complex.

It can be observed that the 6 distributions in panel A show a
striking similarity with the r1_3 distributions, the solid lines in
panel C, which is obvious considering that the two variables
are related by r13 = 2lsin(6/2) (l is the Coc-Coc distance). In fact,
this relationship is also directly measured by the (r13, 6) correl-
ation map reported in the Supplementary Material.

3.4 Internal variables correlation

A comparison between the correlation maps of the conform-
ational variables of the all-atom and CG models is reported in
Figure 4, where the (6, g0) correlation map of 0t helices and un-
structured proteins (Panels A and B, respectively) is compared
with the Ramachandran plots (CD, III correlation map) of the
same datasets (Panel C and D).

The (6, (p) correlation map can be considered the equivalent of
the Ramachandran plot for the minimalist representation
(Tozzini, 2010a). In fact, the helices plot shows a peaked concen-
tration in a speciﬁc area both in Panel A and C (green area),
deﬁning the ‘helical region’. The helical peak is also present in the
unstructured proteins plot (Panel B and D), which, however, also
shows occurrence in other areas, corresponding to extended
structures (around 6: 130, psi—175 and (Dz—135, l11:135,
blue area), turns and coils, as well as out of the region corres-
ponding to deﬁned secondary structures, as expected. The ‘un-
structured’ proteins Ramachandran map (Fig. 4D) shows a more
broad population of all the allowed areas, with concentration in
all the secondary structures areas (delimited by green, red and
blue lines, representing the right-handed, and left-handed helices

and extended structures), because of the residual presence of
folded secondary structures even in the unstructured proteins.
The corresponding areas are well visible and separated also in
the (6, go) correlation map, conﬁrming its usability in the analysis
of the secondary structures as the Ramachandran map.
Additional concentrations are visible in the two maps out of
the secondary structures regions, related to unstructured transi-
tion or random conformations. It must be noted that in the (6, go)
correlation map, two subsequent 6 are involved with any given go.
As a consequence, two possible maps can be evaluated: N(6—, go)
between a dihedral and the preceding bond angle and N(6+, go)
between a dihedral and the following bond angle. These are dif-
ferent due to the directionality of the polypeptide (see a

comparison in Supplementary Material). A detailed discussion
about this point is beyond the scope of this article and is ad-
dressed elsewhere (Spampinato et al., in preparation).

It is interesting to note that, with respect to the Ramachandran
map, the (6, go) map has a more direct interpretation: the go dihe-
dral directly represents the helicity, thus go: :I: 180 corresponds
to ﬂat structures, go 2 0 to rings, whereas positive and negative go
correspond to right- or left-handed structures with different de-
grees of helicity. For instance, the presence of a populated area at
go ~ —170 and 6 ~ 120 indicates that the extended structures tend
to have a weak left-handed torsionality. This representation
allows more immediately to identify different kind of helices.

More detailed information for the unstructured proteins data-
set is given in the (r1_4, 6, go) 3D map represented in Figure 5. The
relations between r14 distribution and the previously deﬁned
correlation are:

In the 3D map, the highly populated regions distributed in the
volume can be visualized with iso-values surfaces (in gray, in the
upper part of Fig. 5), making the separation between secondary
structures even more immediate than in the 2D map. Again this
is a consequence of choosing immediately physically interpret-
able variables for the 3D map building. In fact, the r14 is a
particularly important variable especially in certain kind of heli-
ces, being associated to the formation of local hydrogen bonds
stabilizing certain kind of helices and turns.

For this reason, an alternative visualization of the 3D map by
means of the iso-variable sections, e.g. the iso-rH (lower part of
Fig. 5) is also particularly interesting. Figure 5 reports the sec-
tions corresponding to three relevant values of the single variable
r14 distribution (red dots A, B, C in the top right plot). 2D maps
of these slices are also reported in the tree bottom plots (corres-
ponding letters) each with its colors bar. By deﬁnition, the single
variable r14 distribution (right upper plot) is the (renormalized)
integral over 6 and go of the 3D map. The 3D representation is
generated with Visual Molecular Dynamics (VMD) software
from the CUBE ﬁle. The surface corresponding to the helical
region (residually populated also in the ‘unstructured’ dataset)
is a roughly ellipsoid shape located at r14~ 5.75 A. This is also
conﬁrmed by the r14: 5.75 section (plot A Fig. 5), in which a
high concentration in the helical area is observed. In this plot,
one can also observe an upside-down parabolic shape is popu-
lated (red-blue shades). This kind of correlation is, in fact,
induced among the variables 6 and go by keeping constant the
r14 (see Trovato and Tozzini, 2012).

At higher levels of r14 other structures appear, ﬁrst a transi-
tion region (plot B) and then the extended structures region (plot
C). We defer a discussion of the structural meaning of the infor-
mation present in the 2D and 3D map to a forthcoming work.
Other sample 2D and 3D maps involving different variables are
reported in the Supplementary Material.

Fig. 5. r14, 6, (p map for the X—ray PDB unstructured proteins. An iso-surface (level = 120) is represented in gray and three r14 = const sections are in
color. The three r14 values are chosen corresponding to three relevant values of the single variable r14 distribution (red dots A, B, C in the top right
plot). 2D maps of these slices are also reported in the tree bottom plots (corresponding letters) each with its colors bar. By deﬁnition, the single variable
r14 distribution (right upper plot) is the (renormalized) integral over 6 and (p of the 3D map. The 3D representation is generated with VMD from the

4 CONCLUSIONS

SecStAnT is an efﬁcient and ﬂexible software tool to create se-
lective databases of structures extracted from the PDB and to
calculate statistical distribution of internal variables. The focus
of selection criteria is on the secondary and primary structure,
for which accurate algorithms are considered. Additionally, all
the selection criteria for the initial input data, implemented in the
RCSB ‘advanced query’ form, are available. Despite the focus on
the minimalist CG representation, SecStAnT can be as well used
for different CG models with a compatible COL-based backbone
representation, like the popular MARTINI (Marrink et al.,
2007). Statistical distributions and correlations of a number of
internal variables can be performed with different normalization,
allowing the generation of SP by BI.

Moreover, this software was thought as a part of a larger
package for proteins (and other biomolecules) multiscale model-
ing. Consequently, it was designed to be extended to include
advanced techniques for SP generation, such as iterative BI,
multivariable potential generation. The ability to the directly
evaluate correlations among variables gives the possibility to
obtain more accurate potentials correcting the potential of
mean forces by subtracting the correlation effects. In addition,
given the capability of SecStAnT to produce highly selective

distributions, the primary and secondary structure selectivity
can be easily introduced into these potentials.

Apart from SP parameterization, another important class of
SecStAnT applications concerns the secondary structure ten-
dency evaluation of amino acids or sequence motifs, i.e. the
problem of prediction of secondary structure from primary se-
quence. SecStAnT currently offers the possibility to address it at
the minimalist level, with the advantage of simplifying the prob-
lem, and possibly including additional information by means of
3D maps. The Ramachandran plot indicates a limited and con-
ﬁned set of conformations, governed by steric overlap between
atoms in the side chains of adjacent residues (Betancourt and
Skolnick, 2004). Using this information, structure prediction
methods allow a limited search in areas of the conformations
space where the correct conformation is most likely to be
(Keskin et al., 2004). The possibility to calculate Ramachandran
plots of extremely well-deﬁned dataset of secondary structure
fragments permit to have informative statistics. Furthermore,
SecStAnT allows to calculate the probability distribution of
(6, go) and (CD, II!) for Coc and backbone-only representations,
respectively, giving the ability to address the mapping-backmap-
ping of atomistic to CG representation. In conclusion, SecStAnT
is designed with the aim to facilitate the extraction of

information from proteins structures datasets, aid the parameter-
ization of statistics-based potentials and investigate the se-
quence—structure relationship. Furthermore, the expansion of
atomistic-level statistics, as well as the introduction of new mini-
malistic representations will allow in principle to realize accurate,
transferable and predictive potentials for multiscale models.
More generally, it can be considered as tool to ﬁnd useful direc-
tions navigating the continuously expanding ocean of protein
structures.

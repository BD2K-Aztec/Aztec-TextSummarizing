ABSTRACT

Motivation: InFiRe, Insertion Finder via Restriction digest, is a novel
software tool that allows for the computational identification of
transposon insertion sites in known bacterial genome sequences
after transposon mutagenesis experiments. The approach is based
on the fact that restriction endonuclease digestions of bacterial
DNA yield a unique pattern of DNA fragments with defined sizes.
Transposon insertion changes the size of the hosting DNA fragment
by a known number of base pairs. The exact size of this fragment
can be determined by Southern blot hybridization. Subsequently, the
position of insertion can be identified with computational analysis.
The outlined method provides a solid basis for the establishment of
a new high-throughput technology.

Availability and implementation: The software is freely available
on our web server at www.infire.tu-bs.de. The algorithm was
implemented in the statistical programming language R. For the
most flexible use, InFiRe is provided in two different versions. A web
interface offers the convenient use in a web browser. In addition,
the software and source code is freely available for download as
R-packages on our website.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transposons are mobile genetic elements capable of random
insertions into host genomes. This fundamental feature has been
employed for decades to inactivate genes, leaving a detectable
signature at the locus of integration. This well—developed genetic
technique is applicable to the genomes of Viruses, prokaryotes
and eukaryotes (Hayes, 2003; Largaespada, 2009; Vilen et al.,
2003; Yergeau and Mead, 2009). Various modiﬁcations of
traditional transposon mutagenesis facilitated the development of
new techniques, such as signature target mutagenesis (Hensel et al.,
1995), transposon—mediated differential hybridization (Chaudhuri
et al., 2009), genetic footprinting (Smith et al., 1995) and gene
expression analysis (Judson and Mekalanos, 2000; Opperman et al.,

2003). The crucial step of all these methods is the localization of
the transposon insertion sites. In the course of the last years, several
methods for the localization of transposons have been developed.
Among them are the Vectorette PCR, inverse PCR and the cloning of
restricted chromosomal DNA fragment into vectors with subsequent
ampliﬁcation (Arnold and Hodgson, 1991; Ochman et al., 1988).
Single—primer PCR allows a rapid identiﬁcation of insertion sites,
but often requires optimization of the ampliﬁcation conditions
(Karlyshev et al., 2000). With the improvement of DNA sequencing
techniques, it became possible to determine the transposon insertion
site from the bacterial chromosomal DNA (Hoffman et al., 2000;
Qimron et al., 2003).

Here, we present a novel computational method for the
identiﬁcation of insertion sites in transposon—mutagenized
bacterial genomes. The functionality of the algorithm was
successfully demonstrated using a mini—Tn] 0 transposon Legionella
pneumophila Corby library.

2 METHODS
2.1 InFiRe algorithm

To improve the efﬁciency of transposon mutagenesis experiments, we
developed an algorithm for the identiﬁcation of insertion sites in transposon—
mutagenized bacterial genomes. The strategy of this procedure is outlined
in Figure 1. It is based on the restriction digestions of genomic DNA
in combination with Southern blot hybridization. In the ﬁrst step, the
genomic DNA is cleaved with different restriction endonucleases. Each
restriction enzyme digest produces a unique pattern of DNA fragments
with deﬁned sizes. In the second step, the sizes of the fragments with an
inserted transposon are determined by Southern blot hybridization with a
transposon—speciﬁc probe. The size of the fragment in the original genome
equals the obtained fragment size minus the length of the transposon. Finally,
using the derived fragment size pattern the most probable genomic position
of the transposon can be calculated by the InFiRe software. Afterwards,
conﬁrmation of the accurate determination of insertion sites can be performed
by PCR.

2.2 Statistics

In order to determine the number of restriction enzymes required for InFiRe
analyses, we developed two statistical models. The explicit model calculates
the number of enzymes based on the genome sequence information, whereas
the theoretical model estimates this number based on a random sequence of
given length. Both models produce similar results.

Fig. 1. Procedure for the identiﬁcation of the transposon insertion in
bacterial genomes. Chromosomal DNA from a transposon insertion mutant
(A) is digested with a set of restriction enzymes (B). Each restriction
digestion results in a unique pattern of DNA fragments. Separation of the
DNA fragments by agarose gel electrophoresis followed by Southern blot
hybridization with a transposon—speciﬁc probe allows determination of the
approximate size of chromosomal fragments containing the transposon (C).
The pattern of the derived fragment sizes allows the calculation of the
most probable genomic position of the transposon via the InFiRe software
(D and E).

2.3 Explicit model

The outlined explicit statistics approach calculates the number of digestions
and shows the most suitable combination of restriction enzymes with an error
probability. In the ﬁrst step, the fragment size distribution for each digestion
i is calculated for a given genome sequence. Fragment sizes x are distributed
almost exponentially. Assuming a random and unbiased DNA sequence,
the approximated distribution P1(x) of the fragment sizes is calculated by
Equation (1) (Fig. 2).

Fig. 2. Example for the DNA fragment sizes distribution using the
L.pneum0phila Corby chromosome and the restriction enzyme EcoRI (red
bars). An observational accuracy of 20% results in an left—peaked distribution
(blue bars). The maximum number of derived fragments is marked with
b,- with a fragment size of xllnax. The course of the red line indicates the
theoretical fragment size distribution [Equation (1)]. The blue line indicates
the theoretical fragment size distribution with an 20% observational accuracy
of the fragment sizes [Equation (2)].

The median of the fragment length m is calculated by m := 4’, where
l is the length of the occurring restriction site. Under consideration
of an observational accuracy at of the fragment sizes derived from the
Southern blot, the intervals of the fragment length distribution widens with
increasing fragment sizes and results in an left—peaked distribution P2(x).
This distribution is calculated by:

b,- :=max (P500) =P§ (xgmx), Vx : 0 (3)

In order to ﬁnd the maximum number of required digestions, solely fragment
sizes within the interval Q,- are considered since xllnax represents the worst
case scenario.
Qi: [xlmax_a.x;nax,x;nax+a.x§nax] (4)

Finally, for every i (ordered by 19,-) all overlaps between the fragments in Qj,
with j 6 [1,2, ...,i] are computed until the number of overlaps is less than
one. The value obtained for i is the number of required digestions.

The results of the statistics approach are scored by an error probability
e. The error probability is computed in a combinatorics approach by the
number of overlaps 0, the number of fragments f 6 Q and the number of all
fragments at of every digestion.

an InFiRe analysis. Diagram shows the number of required digestions for
(A) single restriction enzyme reactions and (B) double restriction enzyme

observational accuracy was developed [Equations (1) and (2); Fig. 2]. The
maximum number of the fragments 17 with size x and observational accuracy
at is calculated by the theoretical distribution P2 (x).

b:=max (P2(x)), VxZO (6)

Taking the maximum number of fragments, it is possible to calculate
the number of required digestions. With every digestion, the approximated
number of possible genome position of the insertion z is calculated. This
number z is inversely proportional to the number of restriction digests
and has to be z: 1. The pseudocode below approximates the number of
digestions:

11(1) is the approximated number of all used fragments.

c (l) is the ratio of fragment size 19 to the number of all fragments 11(1) .
l is the length of the restriction site.

k is the number of restriction enzymes per digestion.

) = k*(g/4Al);
) = b/n(l);

) = C(i-l)*C(l);
) = n(l)+n(i—l);

After the loop, i reﬂects the number of required digestions. It is possible to
use more digestions. In Figure 3, the calculated number of required digestions
is shown for single and double digestions at various observational accuracies.

The explicit and theoretic statistics approaches were compared by random
simulation. This was performed in 360 runs by 10 randomly selected lists of
restriction enzymes that were applied to 12 different prokaryotic genomes
with observational accuracies of 10, 20 and 30% in each case. Hereby, in the
explicit approach the maximum number of required digestions was in average
slightly smaller than in the theoretical approach (mean value of difference
0.58). This was conﬁrmed by a t—test with a P—value of 2.2. 10‘16. The results
demonstrate that in practice the theoretical approach is sufﬁcient, since the
number of digestions is only slightly overestimated.

The use of the InFiRe web interface is divided into three steps: selection
of genome and replicons of interest (A), selection of the transposon (B)
and choice of the digestion parameters (C). Genome and (or) replicons are
selected from a list. Transposons can be chosen from a list, by entering a
transposon sequence into the text ﬁeld or by uploading of a FASTA ﬁles.
The restriction enzymes applied for the digestions can be chosen from the
selection list ‘Enzymes’. This list shows all restriction enzymes, which do
not cut inside the transposon sequence. Finally, the approximated size of
the hybridized fragments can be entered in the ﬁeld ‘Fragment Sizes’ and
analyzed.

and (iii) digestion parameters (Fig. 4). These steps reﬂect the
workﬂow of an InFiRe analysis and should be used in the given
order. In the ﬁrst step, selection of the genome and replicon,
all organisms from sequenced bacterial genomes available at the
NCBI can be chosen (Fig. 4A). One genome can consist of several
replicons, e.g. chromosomes or plasmids. In the second step,
the user selects the transposon (Fig. 4B). The software provides
three possibilities to enter a transposon: selection from the list of
transposons, entering a transposon sequence into the text ﬁeld or
uploading of a FASTA ﬁles. Since it is necessary for the InFiRe
analysis that the applied enzymes do not cut inside the transposon
sequence, the list of permitted restriction enzymes (Enzymes) is
assigned after transposon selection. In the third step, the restriction
enzymes applied for the digestions can be chosen (Fig. 4C). It should
be taken into consideration that one digestion can be performed by

utilization of multiple enzymes. The number of required restriction
digestions and its dependence from observational accuracy of DNA
fragment lengths is shown in Figure 3.

For determination of the DNA fragment sizes, Southern blot
hybridization needs to be performed (Supplementary Materials).
The approximated size of the hybridized fragments is entered in
the corresponding ﬁeld and analyzed.

The results of an InFiRe analysis contains the replicon name
of the organism, start, end and the length of the restriction
fragments (Fig. 5A). The matches are ordered by a score, which
describes the percental accuracy between the estimated and the
calculated fragment sizes and reﬂects the reliability of the prediction.
Every location is linked to the NCBI map viewer that provides
a visualization of the corresponding genome fragment and further
genomic information about the sequence, genes and database links
(Fig. 5B). For conﬁrmation of transposon insertion in the predicted
DNA fragment, the primer(s) can be designed with Primer—BLAST
(Sayers et al., 2011). Veriﬁcation of the transposon insertion can
be performed by PCR using primer binding inside the transposon
sequence and primer binding outside the predicted DNA fragment
or two primers binding outside the predicted DNA fragment.

3.2 Application of the InFiRe software and
experimental veriﬁcation of the prediction

We successfully applied the algorithm in a case study using
a L.pneum0phila Corby mini—TnIO transposon library. After the
screening for L.pneum0phila mutants, which are attenuated in
intracellular survival within host cells, we received a set of bacterial
strains with unknown insertion sites (Shevchuk and Steinert, 2009).
We applied the described protocol for the identiﬁcation of insertion
sites in the generated mutants. During the design of the experiment,
we chose enzymes that do not cut inside the mini—TnIO transposon
sequence. The number of restriction digestions was statistically
calculated and resulted in ﬁve digestions. For every digestion, we
used a combination of two restriction enzymes per digest. This
adaptation of the method decreased the size of expected DNA
fragments and resulted in an increase of the observational accuracy.
The exact size of the fragments was determined by Southern
blot hybridization (Southern, 2006, 1975). Figure 6 represents the
obtained digestion pattern for one of the analyzed L.pneum0phila
CorbyzzTnIO mutants. The approximated size of hybridized
fragments were analyzed by InFiRe and the most probable position
of insertion was calculated. Accordingly, transposon insertion was
found in L.pneum0phila Corby chromosome between 762 524 bp
and 765 083 bp. The PCR ampliﬁcation and sequencing conﬁrmed
the insertion at position 763 194 bp (Fig. 5).

4 DISCUSSION

In this study, we developed a new approach for the prediction
of transposon insertion sites in transposon—mutagenized bacteria.
InFiRe is based on a simple algorithm and allows the simultaneous
determination of insertion sites by standard restriction digestion
combined with Southern blot hybridization. The method is
applicable to all sequenced organisms and therefore has a great
potential to bring beneﬁts in a wide range of applications.

In comparison to existing methods, InFiRe has several
advantages. First, the method does not require intensive
experimental optimization, therefore numerous insertion mutants
can be analyzed simultaneously. Second, InFiRe overcomes the
difﬁculties associated with the ampliﬁcation and sequencing of
GC—rich genomic fragments. Lastly, the method allows for the
determination of exact position of a transposon insertion in any
genome. This is especially important for identiﬁcation of the
transposons, which are integrated in repetitive sequences. Although
long repeated sequences are carefully annotated in sequenced
genomes, less attention was paid to investigate the biological role
of these structures (Hahn, 2009; Hill, 1999; Romero et al., 1999).
Thus, InFiRe may also open new ways to analyze the functions of
repeated sequences in prokaryotic genomes.

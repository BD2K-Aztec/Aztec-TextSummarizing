Abstract

Motivation: A large fraction of eukaryotic proteins contain unstructured tails or linkers. The pres-
ence of flexible regions allows these systems to experience a high level of mobility facilitating their
biological function. The complex nature of protein rotation in such flexible modular systems pre-
cludes a straightforward application of hydrodynamic methods to calculate their rotational mo-
tional properties. We describe the workflow of HYdrodynamic CoUpling of Domains (HYCUD), a
program for prediction of effective rotational correlation times in multidomain proteins. The usage
of HYCUD is demonstrated by its application to the ribosomal protein L7/L12. Rotational correlation
times predicted by HYCUD might be used to detect molecular switch events mediated by disorder—-

order transitions in interdomain linkers.

1 Introduction

The function of biological macromolecules depends on their internal
mobility supported by the presence of intrinsically disordered re-
gions (Huang et al., 2014; Tompa, 2012). Reorientational motion of
biomolecules can be followed through a variety of experimental
techniques (Loman et al., 2010; Walker et al., 2004). However, for
slowly tumbling systems, the use of these experimental techniques is
limited. On the other hand, theoretical prediction of rotational mo-
tional behavior through standard hydrodynamic methods (Aragon,
2011) is complicated in these systems by the presence of several po-
tentially coupled motions (Wong et al., 2009). To overcome these
problems, modification of rigid-body hydrodynamics (Bae et al.,
2009) as well as Brownian dynamics of coarse-grained models with

the inclusion of hydrodynamic interactions (Amoros et al., 2013)
have been employed. Here, we describe the workﬂow of a recently
developed alternative approach (Rezaei-Ghaleh et al., 2013) called
HYdrodynamic CoUpling of Domains (H YCUD) to predict the ro-
tational correlation time (Tc) of protein domains within flexible
modular systems. The details of the H YC UD method, together with
its application to the flexible two-domain ribosomal protein L7/L12
and protein X of Sendai virus, are reported.

Fig. 1. Workflow of HYCUD, starting from a PDT file containing five PDB mod-
els each comprised by three fragments and yielding average rotational correl-
ation time (<1c >) for each fragment

protein domains are known, ensembles of the whole protein struc-
tures can be generated using freely available programs. One such
program is ensemble optimization method (EOM) (Bernado et al.,
2007). The core of H YCUD is formed by a Python script that takes
the aforementioned ensemble as a single PDT file (ensemblepdt),
and proceeds as follows to calculate the ensemble-average Tc (<Tc>)
of each protein module (Fig. 1, further details in Supplementary
Information):

1. The ensemblepdt input ﬁle is parsed, and a temporary directory
structure is generated containing one protein databank (PDB)
ﬁle for each model in the PDT ﬁle. If required, a third-party pro-
gram is called to reconstruct backbone and side-chain coordin-
ates on the basis of Calpha atom traces (Li and Zhang, 2009).

2. According to a user-deﬁned scheme, which determines the
boundary of fragments in the aminoacid sequence of the whole
protein, each PDB model will be split into some fragments and
placed in a temporary subdirectory. Deﬁnition of the boundaries
of the folded domains is guided by the available experimental
knowledge. With regard to the unfolded regions where little ex-
perimental evidence exists, fragment lengths are set to 12—14
residues—that is twice the typical persistence length of unfolded
polypeptide chains (Schwalbe et al., 1997).

3. For each fragment, the third-party program HYDROPRO (v.
10) (Ortega et al., 2011) is called to calculate the hydrodynamic
properties, i.e. rotational correlation time TQO and intrinsic vis-
cosity [no]. A parameter ﬁle hydropro.dat will guide this step of
calculation. To prevent repetition of HYDROPRO calculations
for the folded fragments which have the same size/shape across
the structural ensemble, their TQO and [110] are calculated separ-
ately and subsequently ﬁxed.

4. After extracting TQO and [no] of each fragment from
HYDROPRO output result ﬁles, the script uses the pairwise dis-
tance between centers of mass of protein fragments to derive a
scaling factor representing the ‘effective viscosity’ experienced
by each fragment within the context of the whole molecule. The
TQO of each isolated fragment will then be multiplied by this scal-
ing factor, yielding a new TC value, which is then corrected for
the local viscosity effects.

5. In the last step, the corrected TC of each fragment calculated for
any member of the protein ensemble will be averaged over the
whole ensemble after elimination of outliers.

With respect to runtime, Steps 1 and 2 scale linearly with the
number of PDB models in the ensemble and the total number of

fragments per model. Moreover, these two steps are very fast such
that they do not pose a significant limit to the speed of H YC UD cal-
culations. The most time-consuming step involves the HYDROPRO
calculations. As stated earlier, HYDROPRO calculations can be
skipped for globular domains by fixing their top and [no]. In this
way, the computational cost of Step 3 will be mainly determined
(linearly scaled) by the number of PDB models in the ensemble, the
number of fragments in disordered regions per model and the par-
ameter NSIG in HYDROPRO calculations. The computational costs
of Steps 4 and 5 also scale linearly with the number of PDB models
in the ensemble and quadratically (linearly for Step 5) with the total
number of fragments per model, although they are typically negli-
gible compared to Step 3. With a dedicated 8- or 12-core Linux ma-
chine, the HYCUD calculations for an ensemble of 500 models,
each containing three globular regions and four disordered frag-
ments (such as the dimeric L7/L12 protein) typically takes ~1—2 h.

3 Results

The 120-residue L7/L12 ribosomal protein contains two globular
domains, an N-terminal domain (NTD) responsible for protein di-
merization and a C-terminal domain (CTD) (Gudkov, 1997). The
NTD and CTD are connected via a long ﬂexible linker (Bocharov
et al., 1998). Here, we first generated an ensemble of 5000 random
structures for the dimeric L7/L12 protein using the EOM program
(Bernado et al., 2007) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Subsequently,
H YCUD calculations were performed to predict the effective TC of
the dimerized NTD and each CTD within the full-length protein
dimers. Supplementary Figure 52A shows that the H YCUD predic-
tion for both NTD and CTD converged within an ensemble size of
500—1000. The Tc distribution within the ensemble of dimeric L7/
L12 is shown in Figure 1.

52B. Supplementary Table S1 presents the results of H YC UD cal-
culations. Close agreement with the experimental results (Bocharov
et al., 2004) was obtained considering the uncertainty range of experi-
mental data and ~5% inaccuracy in hydrodynamic calculations
(Ortega et al., 2011). Further support for the validity of H YCUD is
provided by the excellent agreement between predicted and experi-
mental Tc of the 53-residue domain of protein X from Sendai virus
(Houben et al., 2007) (Supplementary Fig. S3 and Supplementary
Table S1) as well as several other examples reported in Rezaei-Ghaleh
et al. (2013) (Supplementary Table 52). In conclusion, we described a
computational tool to predict the effective rotational correlation time
of domains in ﬂexible multidomain proteins. The presented tool is
easy to use and provides users insight into the rotational motion of
protein modules within dynamic modular biomolecules.

Abstract

Motivation: Transient S-sulfenylation of cysteine thiols mediated by reactive oxygen species plays
a critical role in pathology, physiology and cell signaling. Therefore, discovery of new S-sulfeny-
lated sites in proteins is of great importance towards understanding how protein function is

regulated upon redox conditions.

Results: We developed PRESS (PRotEin S-Sulfenylation) web server, a server which can effectively
predict the cysteine thiols of a protein that could undergo S-sulfenylation under redox conditions.
We envisage that this server will boost and facilitate the discovery of new and currently unknown
functions of proteins triggered upon redox conditions, signal regulation and transduction, thus un-
covering the role of S-sulfenylation in human health and disease.

1 Introduction

Protein S-sulfenylation is a transient post-translational modification
through which cysteine (CYS) thiols of proteins are reversibly oxi-
dized to cysteine sulfenic acids (CSO), an event that modulates their
function and activity. It has been shown that reactive oxygen species
(ROS) mediated S-sulfenylation of cysteine thiols is a crucial inter-
mediate state in a variety of cysteine modifications and acts as a
regulatory mechanism in pathology, physiology and cell signaling
(Paulsen and Carroll, 2013; Paulsen et al., 2012; Yang et al., 2014).
The discovery, therefore, of new S-sulfenylated sites in proteins is of
great importance towards understanding how protein function is
regulated upon redox conditions.

Experimental discovery and identification of new C50 in pro-
teins is an expensive, intensive and time-consuming process.
Although numerous servers exist for the prediction of cysteine modi-
fications such as S-Nitrosylation, S-Glutathionylation, etc.,
structure-based prediction of transient S-sulfenylation is still elusive.

Herein, we developed PRotEin S-Sulfenylation (PRESS), a server
that predicts, rapidly and efficiently, CSO sites in proteins. This is a
structure-based methodology that relies on the observation of a high
conservation in the spatial environment of C50 sites.
(Supplementary Section 1, Tables 51, S2 and Figs 51—55). To build
PRESS, we took advantage of the under-utilized information of high
resolution X-ray structures bearing CSO sites.

2 Server description

The PRESS server is a useful tool for exploring redox regulated path-
ways. It provides a user friendly interface, where a user can upload
Protein Data Bank (PDB)-formatted protein structures of interest,
derived either from experimental data or homology modeling, and
have access to: (i) Information regarding the surrounding environ-
ment of cysteines from three different perspectives (Supplementary
Section 2). First, the neighboring amino acids of each cysteine in the

protein sequence (lying within a window size of W: 1 1, centered at
the cysteine) are extracted. Second, the spatial amino acid neighbors
surrounding each cysteine in 3D space, lying within a user defined
radius, are extracted. The distance between a cysteine and a neigh-
boring amino acid corresponds to the shortest distance between any
pair of their atoms, based on their atom coordinates. Third, water
molecules and/or metal ions surrounding each cysteine in 3D space
(lying within a user defined radius) are also extracted. Moreover,
complementary statistical information, concerning all the available
cysteines in the uploaded protein structures, is provided in each of
the above three cases in the form of sequence logos or bar
charts (Supplementary Figs S6—S11). (ii) Automatic prediction of
cysteines in proteins that are prone to undergo transient S-sulfenyla-
tion via an SVM-based predictive algorithm (Supplementary
Section 3). Usage instructions for PRESS can be found in
Supplementary Section 5.

2.1 SVM training

To train the predictive algorithm, we obtained a protein dataset con-
sisting of 204 PDB files from the PDB repository (Berman et al.,
2000). The advanced search utility was used to search for entries
containing the word ‘CSO’. To avoid structure redundancy, results
were filtered to retrieve single representatives in cases of 90% se-
quence identity. Residues annotated as ‘missing’ were removed. To
avoid overestimating the potential of our method, duplicates were
removed (see the description of the training dataset in
Supplementary Section 1). A total of 243 C50 and 777 CYS residues
were retained and used for SVM training (see Supplementary
Section 3). The developed, SVM-based, predictive algorithm oper-
ates by utilizing a combination of four cysteine-related structural
features: (i) neighboring amino acids in the protein sequence,
(ii) neighboring amino acids in the 3D space (lying within a radius
of 5 Angstroms), (iii) the absolute solvent accessibility (ASA) and
(iv) the secondary structure. This selection emerged after performing
a series of different combinations, as described in the supplementary
information, Section 3 — Table S3, and was found to be optimum for
capturing the information related to the surrounding environment of
C50 and CYS residues, contributing in their effective discrimin-
ation. Using 10-fold cross-validation, PRESS can predict CSO sites
with a sensitivity of 79.9%, specificity of 73.6% and an overall bal-
anced accuracy of 76.8%. To further test the performance of the
predictive algorithm, CSO bearing structures were filtered, as above,
to retrieve single representatives in structures with sequence identity
as low as 30% (50 and 70% are also illustrated in the
Supplementary Section 3 — Table S4). Interestingly, even in this case,
PRESS can achieve sensitivity of 75.3%, specificity of 72.4% and an
overall balanced accuracy of 73.8% to predict cysteines sensitive to
S-sulfenylation. This provides solid evidence that the four chosen
structural features incorporated in the SVM successfully capture the
information required for efficient discrimination between C50 and
CYS residues and that our method can achieve a high prediction
accuracy.

2.2 SVM validation

The SVM model obtained from training was employed to make pre-
dictions for different experimentally verified datasets containing
S-sulfenylated proteins (Supplementary Section 1). Endogenous and
oxidant stimulated sets (i.e. H202, EGF) verified by dimedone-based
labeling (Gould et al., 2015; Yang et al., 2014) were included for
testing. By utilizing experimental and homology-modeled PDB files,
PRESS could selectively predict CSO sites in: (i) H202 dataset

(sensitivity 73.50%, specificity 66.60%, accuracy 70.10%), (ii) EGF
dataset (sensitivity 63.70%, specificity 67.10%, accuracy 65.50%),
(iii) endogenous dataset (sensitivity 60.40%, specificity 68.90%, ac-
curacy 64.70%) and (iv) X-ray dataset (sensitivity 83.90%, specifi-
city 82.90%, accuracy 83.40%) (Supplementary Sections S1, S3 and
Table S5). Interestingly, oxidant stimulated sets returned higher pre-
diction scores compared to the endogenous sets. Differences in sensi-
tivity could be explained by the fact that oxidant sets represent
quantitative data and thus are ‘more accurate’ for validating the pre-
dictive algorithm than the endogenous. Endogenous sets represent
qualitative data and thus are more likely to include false-positives
due to non-specific CSO labeling. On the other hand, lower scores
in EGF data could be attributed to the fact that EGF represents a
milder oxidative environment, activating fewer and more selective
redox regulated pathways and thus resembling more to an endogen-
ous state.

3 Discussion

The crystallographic PDB repository contains a large number of
high resolution X-ray structures of proteins that bear S-sulfenylation
sites. This information that could be used to decode the principles
governing cysteine S-sulfenylation, has remained largely unexplored.
Using a database of CSO-containing proteins, we identified sev-
eral features contributing to the potential of a cysteine to undergo
S-sulfenylation and devised an SVM-based algorithm, which is avail-
able via the PRESS server, to predict CSO sites. This is of judicial
importance given the intrinsic character of this post translational
modification and its implication in cell signaling, pathology and
physiology. The PRESS server has an overall balanced accuracy of
76.8% on the, currently available, X-ray protein structural data to
predict S-sulfenylation sites in proteins and, thus, it is of great im-
portance towards understanding how protein function is regulated
upon redox conditions. As an indicative example of the effectiveness
of PRESS, we provide the prediction result on the EGF receptor,
which is experimentally verified to be S-sulfenylated on CYS 797
(Paulsen et al., 2012) (Supplementary Section 5 and Fig. S12-A).
Another example is the protein monoacylglycerol lipase, containing
four cysteines from which CYS 201 and CYS 208 were, very re-
cently, experimentally verified to be S-sulfenylated (Dotsey et al.,
2015) (Supplementary Section 5 and Fig. S12-B). Applications of
this server could be oriented towards the discovery of new and cur-
rently unknown functions of proteins triggered upon redox condi-
tions, signal regulation and transduction as also their implication in
disease.

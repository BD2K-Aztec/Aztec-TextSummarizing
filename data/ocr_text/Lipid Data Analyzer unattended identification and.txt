ABSTRACT

Motivation: The accurate measurement of the lipidome permits
insights into physiological and pathological processes. Of the present
high-throughput technologies, LC-MS especially bears potential of
monitoring quantitative changes in hundreds of lipids simultaneously.
In order to extract valuable information from huge amount of mass
spectrometry data, the aid of automated, reliable, highly sensitive
and specific analysis algorithms is indispensable.

Results: We present here a novel approach for the quantitation
of lipids in LC-MS data. The new algorithm obtains its analytical
power by two major innovations: (i) a 3D algorithm that confines
the peak borders in m/z and time direction and (ii) the use of the
theoretical isotopic distribution of an analyte as selection/exclusion
criterion. The algorithm is integrated in the Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA)
application which additionally provides standardization, a statistics
module for results analysis, a batch mode for unattended analysis
of several runs and a 3D viewer for the manual verification. The
statistics module offers sample grouping, tests between sample
groups and export functionalities, where the results are visualized
by heat maps and bar charts. The presented algorithm has been
applied to data from a controlled experiment and to biological data,
containing analytes distributed over an intensity range of 106. Our
approach shows improved sensitivity and an extremely high positive
predictive value compared with existing methods. Consequently, the
novel algorithm, integrated in a user-friendly application, is a valuable
improvement in the high-throughput analysis of the lipidome.

1 INTRODUCTION

Advances in lipidomics technologies utilizing mass spectrometry
have led to a rapid increase in the number, size and rate
at which datasets are generated. LC—MS especially bears the
potential for monitoring quantitative changes in hundreds of lipids
simultaneously. In order to deal with the acquired data automated
and reliable software tools are required.

Currently available lipidomics MS—quantitation tools can be
classiﬁed in two groups, each extracting 2D subsets of MS data: one
group (Ejsing et al., 2006; Haimi et al., 2006, 2009; Leavell and
Leary, 2006; Song et al., 2007) requires m/z proﬁles or m/z spectra;
and the other group (Katajamaa et al., 2006; Pluskal et al., 2010)
extracts chromatograms for quantitation. A representative of the ﬁrst
group is LIMSA which can analyse m/z spectra only (Haimi et al.,
2006, 2009). It utilizes an additional program (SECD) to extract
the m/z spectra. The user has to deﬁne manually a trapezoid in
the m/z—time map of the LC—MS data containing the lipid series
of interest (a collection of lipids having the same amount of C
atoms). This extracted m/z spectra serve as input for the LIMSA
algorithm. In contrast, szine2 (Katajamaa et al., 2006; Pluskal
et al., 2010), a program from the second group, provides several
algorithms to automatically extract chromatograms for processing.
Both programs select the peaks for an analyte based on the exact m/z
value. However, an LC—MS peak is a 3D object, whereupon each
of its data points is characterized by retention time, m/z ratio and
intensity. Consequently, all of the available tools lose information
from a whole dimension (in the ﬁrst group by the m/z proﬁle
extraction and the other group by the chromatogram extraction),
and thus decrease the ability to clearly distinguish between closely
overlapping peaks (Fig. 1). Furthermore, overlapping peaks occur
frequently in lipidomic data due to the particular nature of lipids.
The chemical structures of lipids can differ just by one double bond,
resulting in a mass difference of 2 Da between the analytes. Thus,
the base peak (+0 isotope) of the analyte has almost the same mass
as the second isotopic peak (+2 isotope) of the analyte with one
additional double bond. Furthermore, elution times are usually very
close due to the physicochemical similarity of the analytes.

In this article, we present a novel algorithm that addresses the
difﬁculties speciﬁc to lipidomics MS—data quantitation by two novel
approaches: (i) exact peak border conﬁnement and (ii) accounting
for the theoretical isotopic distribution for peak selection. The
novel border conﬁnement increases the ability to detect overlaps
and reduces their effects. The theoretical isotopic distribution is

used as an exclusion and selection criterion and as such increases
speciﬁcity. These two principles allow accurate and highly speciﬁc
peak identiﬁcation, which is required for the unattended high—
throughput analysis of lipids. To assess the performance of the
new algorithm, we (i) conducted a controlled experiment to test
the accuracy of the quantitation and (ii) applied the algorithm to
biological data to test its sensitivity and positive predictive value.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS

The Lipid Data Analyzer (LDA) software is a stand—alone, platfonn—
independent Java application, using J ava3D (https://java3d.dev.java.net) for
visualization.

2.1 Theoretical isotopic distribution

The theoretical isotopic distribution is calculated for each mass shift with the
aid of probability theory, so that the probability for an isotopic mass peak is
the sum of the mutual combinations of atomic isotopes, which result in the
+x mass shift:

p(+x) = Z p(mutualC0mbination) ( 1)
For the theoretical isotopic distribution, the reference values are then
determined based on the measured base peak according to the formula
(Supplementary Section 1):

P(+x)
p(+0)

 

Area(+x) 2 Area( +0) (2)

2.2 Controlled experiment

The controlled experiment consisted of ﬁve mixtures (prepared as triplicates)
of the analytes TG54:0, TG54:1, TG54:2 and TG54:3, and TG48:0 as
reference value, which was present at the same concentration (5 uM). In
the ﬁrst mix, the analytes were present at the same concentration (2 uM)
to test the ionization efﬁciencies of the analytes, while in mix 2—5 the
analytes were mixed at different concentrations to test the quantitation
at different intensities. The relative concentrations of the analytes were:
TG54:3:TG54:2=2:1; TG54:2 : TG54:l=5:l; TG54:1 : TG54:0=10:1.
Mixes 2—5 correspond to a dilution series with the following ratios:
mix2:mix3=2: l; mix2:mix4=5 : l; mix2:mix5= 10 : 1.

Data were acquired by MS (more details about sample preparation and MS
can be found in Supplementary Section 2) and analysed with LDA, LIMSA
and szine2. The standard parameters of LIMSA and szine2 were
inappropriate for high—resolution MS data (too few analytes were identiﬁed),
and thus the parameters were adapted accordingly (Supplementary
Section 3). The analytes showed ammonium and ammonium—acetonitrile
adducts, and the sum of both adducts was taken as the quantitative measure.
The analysis with LDA was performed in an automated way relying only on
the m/z value. In contrast, LIMSA required manual extraction of the proﬁles
for the automated quantitation, and szine2 information on retention time.
Following that, the ratios of the dilution series were calculated and the
average deviation from the expected ratio was taken as quality parameter:

2.3 Biological experiment

For the biological data, three groups of C57BL male mice (n = 3 each) aged
12 weeks were maintained on a regular light—dark cycle (14 h light, 10 h dark)
and fed on either standard laboratory chow diet (4.5% w/w crude fat) or high
fat diet (34% w/w crude fat). For fasted samples, mice fed on chow diet were
fasted over night for 16 h. The aim was to characterize the TG species of
lipid droplets (LD) isolated from primary hepatocytes of mice subjected
to the different feeding regimes. Primary hepatocytes were isolated by
collagenase digestion according to Riccalton—Banks et al. (2003) with some
modiﬁcations (Supplementary Section 4). Primary hepatocytes were lysed by
nitrogen cavitation and LDs were isolated by ultra centrifugation. Lipids were
extracted according to Folch et a]. (1957). The sample was split into two parts,
since LDs contain mainly TG (Blouin et 01., 2010) and the chromatographic
separation and peak shape would be very poor for TGs without dilution,
whereas other lipids would be hardly detectable in a diluted sample. One
part of the extract was diluted 1:66 and served for the analysis of TGs,
and the other fraction remained undiluted for the analysis of phospholipids
and sphingomyelin. The extracts were dissolved in CHCl3/MeOH ( 1:1, v/v)
and acquired by LC—MS as described in Supplementary Section 2. First,
the peaks were manually veriﬁed (visualization with the implemented 3D
viewer). A peak was considered valid if it occurs at the expected retention
time (each additional double bond in a molecular species lowers the retention
time by about 0.5—1.5 min). Subsequently, TG data were automatically
analysed by LDA and szine2 and the results were compared. While
LDA performs the automated quantitation based on the m/z value of the
analyte only, szine2 requires additionally information about the retention
time (cf. controlled experiment). The data from undiluted samples were
analysed with LDA only to show the applicability to molecule classes other
than TG.

3 ALGORITHM IMPLEMENTATION
3.1 3D algorithm

The novel algorithm for accurate peak conﬁnement works on the
basis of several chromatogram and proﬁle extractions, in which
the chromatogram/proﬁle extraction is based on an adapted version
(Hartler et al., 2007) of the ASAPRatio algorithm (Li et al., 2003)
with a changed peak border detection method. This new method
detects peak borders based on abrupt changes in the gradient of
a peak curve (see Section 5 and SFig. l in the Supplementary
Material). The chromatogram and proﬁles are used to determine
four peak border points. An ellipse through these border points is
ﬁtted, forming the border for the peak (Supplementary Section 6).
Raw intensities inside the ellipse are used to calculate the area of
the peak. This approach minimizes the effect of potential overlaps
and does not contain smoothing artefacts, since it works on raw
intensities.

Figure 1 shows two overlapping peaks which cannot be separated
by the conventional 2D methods. In Figure 2, these two peaks
are depicted from a top—view on the m/z map and the novel 3D
algorithm is illustrated schematically. First, the algorithm extracts a
chromatogram with a broad m/z range and identiﬁes the time point
at the peak summit. Second, at the time point of the summit, an
m/z proﬁle with a narrow time range is extracted. The algorithm
determines the peak summit again and detects the two border points
of the proﬁle peak, which already form points for the ellipse ﬁt in
m/z direction. Then, two chromatograms are extracted; the ﬁrst one
uses the two proﬁle border points as m/z range for the extraction;
the second one uses a very narrow range around the m/z value of
the proﬁle peak summit. Now, in both chromatograms peak border

The bigger ellipse represents the peak to be quantiﬁed; the smaller one is the
overlapping one. First, a standard chromatogram ‘A’ with a broad m/z range
‘a’ is extracted (no overlap distinguishable). Second, at the time point with
the highest intensity an m/z—proﬁle ‘B’ with a narrow range ‘b’ is extracted.
Third, the m/z borders and the m/z value with the highest intensity are used
to extract chromatogram ‘C’ with range ‘0’ (uses borders found in ‘B’) and
‘D’ with narrow range ‘d’. ‘C’ and ‘D’ are used to identify borders in the
time range. Now four border points of the peak are determined (dots on the
borders of the bigger ellipse) and an ellipse is ﬁtted through them. The ellipse
is used as the peak border. Just intensities inside the ellipse contribute to the
total peak intensity.

points are detected, which can be used for the ellipse ﬁt in the time
direction.

In general, the border points of the chromatogram with the smaller
m/z range are used for the ellipse. However, the chromatogram
with the narrow m/z range could possibly out just a small part of
the overlapping peak, resulting in an undetectable change of the
gradient in the curve, whereas the extracted broader chromatogram
detects the change. Hence, the broader chromatogram returns a much
smaller time range than the narrower one. In this case, the border
points of the broad chromatogram are taken for the ellipse ﬁt. The
ellipse is then ﬁtted with the two border points in m/z direction and
the two border points in time direction (blue points in Fig. 2), and
only intensities within this ellipse contribute to the ﬁnal peak area.

3.2 Theoretical isotopic distribution

Due to the nature of lipids, there is in general more than one
candidate peak available for a distinct m/z value. In order to select
the correct peak, LDA takes the theoretical isotopic distribution
into account, which is used as a selection/exclusion criterion. First,

the algorithm checks whether the peak belongs to another isotopic
distribution (exclusion). Second, it checks whether the isotopic
peaks related to the analyte match (in a certain range) its theoretically
calculated values (selection). If both criteria are fulﬁlled the peak
is accepted. In contrast with the other existing algorithms, the LDA
has no deisotoping step; every isotopic peak is quantiﬁed separately
and the sum is taken as the quantitative measure.

3.3 Robust standardization

In addition to the novel algorithm the software features a statistics
section with standardization. Three different standardization
methods are provided: (i) correction based on a single standard;
(ii) a median method; (iii) standardization on an internally developed
methodology. The normalization on a single standard is trivial:
each standard forms a reference value. The median method uses
the median of the standards in a sample as a reference. The third
method has been developed to provide a very robust method of
standardization because suppression effects are quite common in
MS. First, statistics from each standard are calculated (median
and coefﬁcient of variation). Second, the ‘most robust’ standard
is selected by a two—step procedure. In the ﬁrst step, standards
are selected only if they are found at least 90% of the most often
found standard. The best standard is then the one with the highest
intensity which is within 5% of the standard with the best coefﬁcient
of variation. If there is none within the 5%, the one with the
best coefﬁcient of variation is taken. Third, applicable standards
are selected for each experiment by a generous outlier removal. A
standard is an outlier only if it is less than half of the lower quartile
value or if it is higher than the double of the upper quartile value.
Fourth, a ‘global reference area’ is deﬁned, which is the ‘most robust’
standard area of an experiment whose value is closest to the mean
value of the ‘most robust’ standard. Fifth, for each experiment a
reference ratio between each applicable standard for the experiment
and the experiment chosen in the previous step is calculated.

Section 7):

4 EXPERIMENTAL VALIDATION

In order to test the accuracy of the algorithm, we conducted a
controlled experiment (see Section 2) and compared the results of
LDA, szine2 (Katajamaa et al., 2006; Pluskal et al., 2010) and
LIMSA (Haimi et al., 2006, 2009). First, samples were prepared
containing all analytes at the same concentration to test the ionization
efﬁciency. LDA and szine2 showed nearly the same intensities
for TG5420—2, but TG54:3 and the standard TG4820 showed smaller
intensities than expected (Supplementary Table TSl). TG54:3 and
TG4820 eluted exactly at the same retention times (25.9—26. 1min) in
all of the samples (Supplementary Table TS 1), and suppressed each
other. Consequently, we did not use TG48:0 as a standard, since
it would have skewed the results. Second, we compared analytes
over a dilution series (mix 2—5), from which we calculated a ratio
relative to the areas found in mix 3 (Table 1 and for more details
see Supplementary Table TSl). In this experiment, the suppression
effects on TG54:3 could just be noticed at mix2, because here the
intensity of TG54:3 was highest. In 8 of 12 possible ratios, the LDA
was closer to the ideal ratio than szine2, and in 10 out of 12
ratios than LIMSA. The average deviation from the ideal ratio was
9.7% for LDA, 10.5% for szine2 and 36.3% for LIMSA. The
LDA performed just slightly better (0.8%) than szine2 in this
experiment, since the peaks in the controlled experiment were quite
well separated, and no overlap occurred. However, the intention
of this experiment was just to show the accuracy of the results.
Nevertheless, the areas of the LDA could be taken for further
analysis without manual review, whereas for szine2 manual
selection of the correct hit from a list of ambiguous peaks was
necessary in 25 of the 150 possible cases.

The performance of the algorithms on biological data was
assessed without LIMSA, because of the unsatisfactory results of
the controlled experiment. The comparison with szine2 was
conducted solely based on TG data, since it allowed for a more
objective manual identiﬁcation of a correct peak due to the regular
distribution of TG peaks. For this data, LDA showed higher
sensitivity (86.1% —> 93.3%) and a signiﬁcantly improved positive
predictive value (89.4% —> 99.1%) compared with szine2
(Table 2 and for more details see Supplementary Table TS2), which
is extremely important for automated high—throughput analysis.
Regarding sensitivity, LDA correctly identiﬁed 678 (93.3%) of
the 727 possible peaks, whereas szine2 identiﬁed 626 peaks
(85.4%). However, 168 of the szine2 identiﬁcations returned
more than one candidate peak (ambiguous identiﬁcations), and for
LDA only 21. Nineteen of those 21 peaks were located in the
peak—tail belonging to the analyte with <5% intensity of the main

peak, or a peak appearing with two summits was considered as
two possible identiﬁcations. The remaining two peaks would not
be viable for analysis and a manual decision would have been
necessary. Regarding positive predictive value, 678 (99.1%) of the
684 reported LDA identiﬁcations were correct, while 626 (89.4%) of
the 700 szine2 hits were true positives, with the same amount of
ambiguous identiﬁcations as in the sensitivity evaluation. This high
positive predictive value demonstrates the extremely high reliability
of the algorithm over a large intensity range, since the intensity ratio
between highest and lowest valid identiﬁcations is almost 106.

The data from the undiluted extract were used to demonstrate
the general applicability of the software to samples containing
minor amounts of phospholipids, i.e. phosphatidyl choline (PC),
phosphatidyl ethanolamine (PE) and sphingomyelin (SM), in the
presence of bulk TG. Even though the average intensity of a PC
peak is around 5% and an average SM peak is around 1% of the
intensity of an average TG peak (Supplementary Table TS3), the
positive predictive values attained were 97.2% for PC, 93.4% for
PE, 97.3% for SM and respective sensitivities were 92.5% for PC,
84.0% for PE and 85.7% for SM (Supplementary Table TS4).

5 SOFTWARE DESCRIPTION

The application supports szML (Pedrioli et al., 2004) as raw
data format. In addition, the Thermo RAW format and the Waters
MassLynx raw data format are supported via the freely available
software ReAdW and massWolf (Keller et al., 2005), which can
be directly integrated in the program. Before quantitation, the
szML ﬁles are translated into an internal indexed chrom ﬁle
format, which provides rapid access to the data (especially useful for
data visualization). The molecules to be identiﬁed are deﬁned in a
Microsoft Excel ﬁle, containing, for each analyte, the name and the
molecular formula and the mass. The m/z must be entered manually,
since it is possible to deﬁne several adducts or modiﬁcations for one
lipid. The quantitation itself can be performed in batch mode. The
calculation of the theoretical isotopic distribution is based on the list
of chemical elements and the probabilities of their isotopes provided
in an extendable XML ﬁle.

The software features a statistics section with normalization,
grouping, visualization and export functionalities. The data can be
normalized on ‘internal standards’, which are added before the
MS data acquisition and should compensate instrument—speciﬁc

TG content. Changes of single molecules are detected at glance with the heat

variations, as well as on ‘external standards’, which are added
before sample preparation and should compensate losses throughout
sample preparation. The standardization procedures are described at
Section 3.3.

The results can be displayed in heat maps and/or bar
charts (Fig. 3), in which several display options are available
(normalization on standards, base peak, total class content, content
of a speciﬁc group, etc.), and an overview of the content of the total
classes. The results can be exported into Microsoft Excel or tab—
delimited format, and the heat maps and bar charts in PNG or SVG
format.

In the LDA, we implemented a sophisticated 3D viewer for the
manual veriﬁcation of the results (Fig. 1), because the extracted
proﬁles/chromatograms are the result of data processing procedures
and provide a constrained view on the data. The 3D viewer offers
adjustable m/z display ranges and resolution levels. Furthermore,
hits can be deleted, added or corrected with several available
quantitation methods (3D method, standard ASAPRatio method, the
method described in Hartler et al. (2007), and the method described
in Section 5 and SFig. 1 in the Supplementary Data).

6 DISCUSSION

The LDA proved to be a powerful and reliable tool for high—
throughput analysis of the lipidome using LC—MS. In a controlled
experiment, we showed that the results are more accurate than
with other available tools (average deviation from the ideal
ratio was 9.7% for LDA, 10.5% for szine2 and 36.3%
for LIMSA). Moreover on biological data, the novel algorithm
proved its real strength: the sensitivity increased from 86.1 to
93.3% and the positive predictive value from 89.4 to 99.1%

compared with szine2. The high positive predictive value is
particularly important for an automated analysis with minimal
human intervention. Moreover, we demonstrated the applicability
of LDA to low abundant lipid species in lipid droplets, like
phospholipids and sphingomyelin. Although intensities measured
were close to noise levels, our algorithm still achieved good to
excellent positive predictive values. Although the experimental data
in this study was generated on an FT—MS instrument, the application
is not limited to high—resolution data. The parameters for the 3D
algorithm have already been adapted for QTOF and low—resolution
QTRAP.

LDA is not limited to the analysis of lipids, but can be extended to
other singly charged analytes by providing the respective molecule
deﬁnition ﬁle. Support for multiple charged molecules like peptides
would require the extraction of more chromatograms for the
theoretical isotopic distribution as selection/exclusion criterion (see
Section 3 .2). For example, when the algorithm checks whether or not
the peak belongs to another isotopic distribution, a chromatogram
at m/z (analyte)—mass (neutron) is extracted. To check a doubly
charged molecule a chromatogram at m/z (analyte) — (mass
(neutron))/2 is required and so on. The smoothing of a chromatogram
is quite time consuming, thus a pre—screening method that works on
the raw data are expected to analyse multiply charged molecules in
a rapid manner.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Systems glycobiology studies the interaction of various
pathways that regulate glycan biosynthesis and function. Software
tools for the construction and analysis of such pathways are not yet
available. We present GNAT, a platform-independent, user-extensible
MATLAB-based toolbox that provides an integrated computational
environment to construct, manipulate and simulate glycans and their
networks. It enables integration of XML-based glycan structure data
into SBML (Systems Biology Markup Language) files that describe
glycosylation reaction networks. Curation and manipulation of net-
works is facilitated using class definitions and glycomics database
query tools. High quality visualization of networks and their
steady-state and dynamic simulation are also supported.
Availability: The software package including source code, help docu-
mentation and demonstrations are available at http://sourceforge.net/
projects/gnatmatlab/files/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Glycosylation is an important post-translational modiﬁcation
that alters a majority of mammalian-secreted and cell surface
proteins. Glycosylated proteins play structural and functional
roles in diverse biological processes including inflammation,
cancer and development. The recent development of advanced
analytical tools has heralded the emergence of Glycomics, a field
where entire glycomes of cell systems are characterized. These
data are starting to be stored in glycosylation-specific databases
like the GlycomeDB (Ranzinger et al., 2011) and the Consortium
for Functional Glycomics (CFG) website (Raman et al., 2006).
Bioinformatics and statistical approaches developed to query
glycomics databases offer an avenue to study glycosylation
(Konishi and Aoki-Kinoshita, 2012). Systems-based mathemat-
ical modelling represents an alternate methodology, particularly
if the emphasis is on the quantitative analyses of biochemical
pathways that contribute to a given experimentally measured
glycan distribution (Krambeck et al., 2009; Liu et al., 2008).
Software applications to construct and analyse glycosylation
reaction networks do not exist.

This manuscript describes a new MATLAB-based toolbox
called Glycosylation Network Analysis Toolbox (GNAT,

pronounced neet). This package provides a streamlined approach
for the construction, visualization and simulation of glycosyla-
tion reaction networks. It introduces a method to store glycan
structure information in SBML format files (Hucka et al., 2003).
It provides basic data structure manipulation tools to tailor
glycans and associated networks. It enables an environment
where data obtained by querying of glycomics databases can
be applied to refine reaction network model structure. It provides
an interactive GUI (Graphical User Interface) that allows link-
age between individual glycans represented in glycosylation net-
works and corresponding data in glycomics repositories. Finally,
the toolbox facilitates steady-state and dynamic simulation of
glycosylation reaction networks.

2 FEATURES AND IMPLEMENTATION

GNAT provides a user-friendly, user-extensible computational
environment to handle glycan structures and glycosylation reac-
tion networks. It is written in Java and MATLAB, and it uses
previously developed libraries: SBMLToolbox (Keating et al.,
2006), GlycanBuilder (Ceroni et al., 2007) and JGraph (http://
www.jgraph.com/jgraph.html). GNAT includes new Java classes
for network visualization, and MATLAB classes and functions
for representation and manipulation of glycans and their
networks (Fig. 1A). All functions and classes can be called
from the MATLAB command line, and this facilitates user-
extensibility and modularity. GNAT functions and classes
enable five types of operations described below (numbered 1 to
5, Fig. IE):

2.1 Network input/ output

GNAT provides a simple strategy to incorporate glycan structure
information into SBML files. To this end, XML-format glycan
structures are embedded in the annotation field of the SBML
species element. SBML Toolbox and GlycanBuilder functions
are used to import/export features related to the SBML files
and Glycan structures, respectively. These operations primarily
handle two of the classes shown in Figure 1B, GlycanStruct and
GlycanNetModel. Here, GlycanStruct class uses the tree structure
to store individual glycan information including residue and
linkage data. GlycanNetModel class is constructed using graph
structure. It describes the pairwise relationships between
glycans. APIs from GlycanBuilder handle conversion between
various glycan formats including GlycoCT, GlycoCT-condensed,
GLYDE and LINUCS (Neelamegham and Liu, 2011).

operations, numbered 1 to 5, are enabled in the toolbox. (C) Reaction network model displayed in the Glycosylation Network Visualizer GUI. Glycans
are represented in CFG nomenclature (http://www.functionalglycomics.org/static/consortium/Nomenclature.shtml)

2.2 Glycan and network object manipulation

Construction and manipulation of glycan and network objects is
enabled by deﬁning various classes. These can be categorized
into two groups depending on whether they handle ‘Glycans’
(bottom half, Fig. 1A) or ‘Networks’ (top half, Fig. 1A).
Whereas the former group deals with the properties of individual
glycans that are described by GlycanLinkage, GlycanResidue,
etc., the latter includes classes that describe network components
like GlycanSpecies and Rxn (Reaction). Manipulation of individ-
ual class properties using methods allows reﬁnement of individ-
ual glycans and glycosylation network models. The Getting
Started.pdf document (provided with the GNAT package at
the SourceForge website) and the MATLAB ‘help classname’
command exhaustively describe all properties and methods
related to the individual classes.

2.3 Database query

Reﬁnement of reaction network models is possible using know-
ledge stored in glycomics databases. GNAT enables this by pro-
viding facilities for querying databases. Such queries to the
GlycomeDB or CFG databases return information regarding
glycan family, species where speciﬁc glycans have been detected,
etc. Most of the functions query databases using their respective
glycan ID, and this is enabled after basic GNAT installation.
Advanced database commands that enable X ML-structure—
based querying of GlycomeDB requires a PostgreSQL server.

2.4 Display glycosylation network

A user-friendly GUI called Glycosylation Network Visualizer
(GNV, Fig. 1C) within GNAT provides high-quality visualiza-
tion of glycosylation pathways. This environment enables visu-
alization of multi-compartment glycosylation networks. Editing
of network layout (Circle, Hierarchical, Compact Tree), scaling
of graphics, mouse wheel-based zoom-in/out functions and
exporting of graphics in PNG or GIF formats are also possible.
Display options can be speciﬁed by command line operations.
Linkage between individual glycans in the GNV window and
the GlycomeDB database is enabled using the database connect-
ivity functions. This module uses APIs from GlycanBuilder and
] Graph.

2.5 Steady-state and dynamic simulation

Computation of network dynamic states is implemented using
MATLAB’s built-in Ordinary Differential Equation (ODE) sol-
vers. Steady-state solutions are calculated using the MATLAB
Optimization toolbox function ‘fsolve’. Additional analysis of re-
sults is feasible using a range of functions available in MATLAB.

3 INSTALLATION AND AVAILABILITY

GNAT is a platform-independent MATLAB toolbox that has
been tested in Windows, Linux and Mac OS. It uses MATLAB
Release 14.05 (R201 lb) or later versions. No compilation is
required. Basic toolbox installation, which enables a majority of
GNAT functions, consists of two steps: (i) installing compressed
ﬁles, and (ii) editing java library path. Advanced database func-
tionality described in Section 2.3 requires the MATLAB
Database Toolbox and the GlycomeDB PostgreSQL server.
The package includes instructions for installation, usage and
examples. Two detailed case studies that focus on database con-
nectivity and simulation of glycosylation pathways are provided
in the GettingStarted.pdf document. The latter describes the con-
struction, visualization and simulation of the N-linked glycosyla-
tion reaction network described by (Umana and Bailey, 1997).

4 SUMMARY

GNAT is the ﬁrst toolbox for glycosylation reaction network
analysis. It can facilitate research in the emerging ﬁeld of
Systems Glycobiology (Neelamegham and Liu, 2011).

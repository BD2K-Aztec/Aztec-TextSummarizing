Abstract

Motivation: Population stratification is one of the major sources of confounding in genetic associ—
ation studies, potentially causing false—positive and false—negative results. Here, we present a novel
approach for the identification of population substructure in high—density genotyping data/next
generation sequencing data. The approach exploits the co—appearances of rare genetic variants in
individuals. The method can be applied to all available genetic loci and is computationally fast.
Using sequencing data from the 1000 Genomes Project, the features of the approach are illustrated
and compared to existing methodology (i.e. EIGENSTRAT). We examine the effects of different cut—
offs for the minor allele frequency on the performance of the approach. We find that our approach
works particularly well for genetic loci with very small minor allele frequencies. The results suggest
that the inclusion of rare—variant data/sequencing data in our approach provides a much higher
resolution picture of population substructure than it can be obtained with existing methodology.
Furthermore, in simulation studies, we find scenarios where our method was able to control the
type 1 error more precisely and showed higher power.

analysis focus is on common variants, i.e. variants with common
minor allele frequencies. Some of the most popular approaches, e.g.
genomic control, structured association, EIGENSTRAT,
STRATSCORE, multi-dimensional scaling, sparse principal compo—
nent analysis (PCA) (Devlin et 61]., 1999, 2004; Epstein et 61]., 2007;
Lee et 61]., 2012; Li and Yu, 2008; Patterson et 61]., 2006; Price et 61].,
2006; Pritchard et 61]., 2000; Reich and Goldstein, 2001; Satten et 61].,
2001) extract the information about population substructure from the
variance/covariance matrix of genotype data. The approaches have
been shown to be efficient and are able to guard genetic association
analysis under most circumstances.

With the arrival of next—generation sequencing data, rare variants,
i.e. genetic loci with small minor allele frequencies, are moving to the
center of the genetic association analysis. The hypothesis is that rare
variant/sequencing data will enable the direct identification of disease
susceptibility loci, which genome—wide association studies have not
been very successful at. Although availability of rare variant/sequence
analysis holds great promise, the effects of population substructure/
admixture on the association analysis of rare variants are unclear and
suitable adjustment methods have not been discussed widely in the lit—
erature (Babron et 61]., 2012; Epstein et 61]., 2012; Mathieson and
McVean, 2012). The effectiveness of existing adjustment approaches
which are mostly built on the estimation of the genetic variance/c0—
variance matrix is unclear for rare variants, since the estimation of the
allelic covariance based on rare variants might not provide sufficient
power. This expected power loss can be attributed to the low variance
of rare variant genotypes and thus the covariance matrix can be unre—
liable for small allele frequencies, e.g. it is suggested to use SNPs with
common allele frequencies for the EIGENSTRAT approach.
Moreover, the key feature of rare variant data in terms of population
substructure is that such variants are genetically much ‘younger’
(Keinan and Clark, 2012; Kryukov et 61]., 2009). The mutations that
originated rare variants have occurred much more recently than those
of common variants, allowing rare variant data to reﬂect even rela—
tively new admixture/substructure. It is therefore unclear whether the
application of adjustment methods, when they are computed based
on common variants, is a suitable way to control for population sub—
structure/admixture in rare—variant analysis.

In this article, we propose a method that is designed to detect
population substructure/admixture both in rare variant data and in
common variant data. Instead of utilizing the genetic variance/covari—
ance matrix, the Jaccard similarity index (Jaccard, 1908) is used.
Among existing similarity measures, the Jaccard similarity index is
most suitable for the similarity calculation based on sparse binary
data, since it emphasizes mutual presences of minor alleles. In com-
parison to identity—by—state similarity measure the Jaccard index has
the advantage that it doesn’t account for SNPs where a pair of indi-
viduals shares a 0 genotype, which is very efficient in a sparse dataset
with only rare variants. We recommend, when available, to exclude
potentially associated variants from the population structure estima—
tion. If no such information is available, we recommend to include all
rare variants in the analysis. In fact, rare variants typically do not
show strong linkage disequilibrium with other rare or common vari-
ants. This is particularly due to their low minor allele frequencies
(Pritchard, 2001; Pritchard and Cox, 2002). If the sample size is mar—
ginal and the sample contains only variants with very small allele fre-
quency, excluding some long—range LD regions can reduce the
resolution of population structure. However, if the Jaccard index is
applied to common variants, we recommend to apply LD-pruning on
the common variants prior to analysis.

The approach has the advantage that it can be applied to all
available genetic loci and it is computationally fast. We have

implemented a C program, which takes the genotype matrix and the
position file as input and produces the Jaccard similarity matrix be—
tween individuals. The application to the complete dataset of the
1000 Genomes Project (2504 individuals, 31 202 510 variants with
MAF g 0.01) on one processor with 2GB RAM running under
Linux took only 8 h.

First, we assess the performance of our approach by application
to the 1000 Genomes Project phase 3 data. A comparison of the re—
sults with existing methodology suggests that our approach provides
better discrimination between subpopulations than current method—
ology. The approach seems to work particularly well, when we re—
stricted the method to rare variant loci. In simulation studies, we
evaluate the type—1 error of our approach and compare it to
EIGENSTRAT, which uses PCA based on the genetic covariance
matrix. For completeness we include in the simulation studies a
model—based method ADMIXTURE (Alexander et 61]., 2009), which
uses a likelihood model to estimate population structure. Under dif—
ferent scenarios, the proposed methodology preserves the type—1
error much better.

2 Methods

Babron et al. (2012) have shown for the UK population that the
population stratification pattern for rare variants is different from
that of more common variants. Moreover, several Consortia (The
1000 Genomes Consortium, 2012, 2015; The UK10K Consortium,
2015) showed that rare variants are found more often within the
same population, especially those which are present only twice
through the sample.

Based on these findings, we aim to develop a measure, which is
suitable to capture the most recent differences between individuals
based on rare variant data. This information would represent a
finer resolution of population structure in rare variant data. In
order to keep the notation and the derivations simple, we outline
the proposed method for one chromosome/genomic region. We as—
sume that one defined genetic region or one entire chromosome
has been sequenced in N individuals. For the purposes of this art—
icle, we do not distinguish whether one or two copies of the minor
alleles are observed. Given the fact that we deal with rare variants
it is rather unlikely to observe homozygous variants. We only dif—
ferentiate between the absence and the presence of the minor allele
at a variant.

Let G represent our modified genotype matrix with N individ-
uals and M markers:

G:    
gNI  gNM

For two sample sets the Jaccard similarity coefficient is defined
as the proportion of intersection between samples A and B divided
by the proportion of their union:

_|AﬂB|

Jac(A,B) — W

When the two samples A and B represent binary vectors or
modified genotypes, as in our case, the Jaccard similarity for indi-
vidual i and j is defined as following. Let 61,-,- represent the number
of markers shared between individual i and j, that is when
gik : 1 /\ gik : 1, b,,- represents the total number of markers, which
satisfy gik : 1 /\ gik : 0, 61'" is the total number of markers, which

satisfy gik : 0 /\ gik : 1. Then, the Jaccard similarity coefficient is
equal to:

Based on the measures Jacij we construct a symmetric similarity

In the EIGENSTRAT approach (Patterson et al., 2006; Price et al.,
2006) PCA is applied to the genetic variance/covariance matrix to
visually detect population structures. The principal components could
also be incorporated into the genetic association analysis as covariates
in order to adjust for population substructure. PCA could also directly
be applied to the similarity matrix SM. This corresponds to kernel
PCA (Scholkopf et al., 1998), where the Jaccard index is considered
as a positive definite kernel (Gower, 1971). In this article the kernel
(Jaccard) matrix is centered, as this allows us to relate the eigenvalues
of the Jaccard matrix to the variance explained by a given component
in the feature space. Subpopulation structure can be visualized by
plotting the first principal components, and association analysis re—
sults can be adjusted for population substructure by including the
principal components of SM as covariates.

The number of covariates to use in an association analysis strongly
depends on the dataset, which is analyzed. It is important to note that
there exists no generally accepted rule to determine the optimal num—
ber of eigenvectors sufficient to correct for population structure in as—
sociation analysis. However, there exist several mostly heuristic
methods in order to choose the number of components to use. The
Kaiser—Guttman criterion and its modifications (Guttman, 1954;
Lambert et al., 1990) are based on the average value of the eigen—
values from the data matrix. Another popular method is to visually in-
spect the scree plot, which plots the eigenvalues in a decreasing order
against the number of principal components. Usually one chooses
only those PCs, which explain the highest amount of variance in the
data, i.e. until the slope is still steep. Another modification of this ap-
proach is the eigengap heuristic (Lee et al., 2010), which is based on
differences between consecutive eigenvalues.

We provide the code that we used to calculate the Jaccard simi—
larity matrix. It is provided on request from authors. The further cal—
culation, analysis and simulations were performed with R.

To assess the properties of the Jaccard similarity matrix SM and
compare them to similarity matrices that are built on the genetic
variance/covariance matrix, the matrix SM will be computed for the
1000 Genomes Project data based on loci with common minor allele
frequency (i.e. MAF > 1%) and based on rare variant data, i.e.
minor allele frequencies of <1 %. Then, we will apply PCA to visual—
ize the information about population substructure that is contained
in the Jaccard similarity matrix. The results are benchmarked with
the EIGENSTRAT approach on real data from the 1000 Genomes
Project and further assessed in a simulation study.

3 Results

3.1 Application to 1000 genomes data
The data of the 1000 Genomes Project Consortium (2012) is an
ideal instrument to assess the capability of the proposed

methodology to detect population substructure in sequence data and
to benchmark its results with the existing standard approach (i.e.
PCA of the genetic covariance matrix). The recent phase 3 release of
the project includes now 2504 indivduals from 26 populations. For
the preliminary analysis of the 1000 Genomes Project data, we cre—
ated two datasets. For dataset 1, we selected sequence data that is
available for the autosomal chromosomes of 2504 unrelated subjects
from 26 different populations (Table 1). For dataset 2, we created a
subset with only European individuals (504 subjects). We assessed
how well PCA based on the Jaccard similarity matrix SM is able to
differentiate between the known populations. We compared the re—
sults of our proposed method to PCA based on the genetic covari—
ance matrix as proposed by EIGENSTRAT (Price et al., 2006). Each
approach was applied twice to the 1000 Genomes Data, once to
data for common variants (MAF > 1%) and then to rare variant
data (MAF§1%, singletons excluded).

3.1.1 Results for common variants

We created a setting that is commonly used in practice. We selected
all common SNPs which remained after linkage disequilibrium (LD)
pruning in order to reduce the LD structure between the variants. In
addition, known, long—range LD regions were excluded from the
analysis (Price et al., 2008). This resulted in a total of 1 934 536
common variants for dataset 1 and 744 520 common variants for
dataset 2. Then, based on the selected loci, we calculated the genetic
covariance matrix and the Jaccard similarity matrix SM, and applied
PCA to both matrices. We used all available variants, although,
when information about potentially associated variants is provided,
they should be excluded from population structure estimation. The

first two principal components of both matrices are shown in
Figures 1 and 2. We used common axis ranges for both methods for
comparison reasons. Both approaches provide quite similar results
for common variants.

3.1.2 Results for rare variants

Because our approach was designed to identify population substruc—
ture based on rare variants, we re—calculated the two matrices, the
genetic covariance matrix and the Jaccard similarity matrix SM,
based on the rare variants of the prior utilized 1000 Genomes
Project data, i.e. 31 202 510 loci for dataset 1 and 4 828 940 for
dataset 2 with a MAF of <1% and excluded singletons. Then, PCA
was again performed for both matrices.

The results are given in Figures 3—5. We used common axis
ranges for both methods for comparison reasons. For PCA based on
the genetic covariance matrix (EIGENSTRAT), the ability to distin-
guish between the different populations has been substantially di—
minished. Many of the populations are clumped together and are
not identifiable. The left panel in Figure 3 depicts that the first two

PCs are driven by the large amount of variance within African popu-
lations which is captured by the covariance matrix on rare variants.
The left panel in Figure 4 illustrates that the second PC is driven by
individual with the largest variance in the sparse genotype matrix.
This creates ‘outliers’ in the principal components and reduces the
resolution of the picture. In Figure 5, we removed the Iberian outlier
for visual inspection for both methods, but we can still see that only
the Finnish population is separated well in the left panel (PCA based
on the covariance matrix).

However, for the PCA based on the Jaccard similarity matrix
SM, we observe the opposite effect. The plot for all 26 worldwide
populations is similar to the one based on common variants and the
first two principal components separate the main continents quite
well. For the European subpopulations the first principal component
separates the Finnish subpopulation and the second PC separates the
two southern populations (IBS and T51) from the two north—western
populations (GBR and CEU).

3.2 Simulation study

We performed a simulation study for rare variants in order to evalu—
ate the type 1 error and power of our approach. The goal of the
simulations was to evaluate the performance of standard association
analysis adjusted for population substructure, using PCA based on
the Jaccard similarity matrix and using PCA based on the genetic co—
variance matrix. For completeness we also evaluated the perform—
ance of a model—based approach, which is not utilizing PCA. We
modified the simulation design described in Price et al (2006) and
utilized it. We used three different minor allele frequency cutoffs:
0.001, 0.005 and 0.01. A small diagram displaying the simulation
workﬂow can be found in Supplementary Figure S1.

For each MAF setting we extracted the allele frequencies
corresponding to this cutoff from the 1000 Genomes four European
populations: CEU, GBR, IBS and T51. We excluded the Finnish
population, which is known to be a population isolate. Due to a
restricted sample size (404 individuals), which is currently available

at 1000 Genomes for given populations, we decided to keep the
overall proportion of the allelic counts during our simulations. That
means we generated data based on allelic counts and not allele fre—
quencies which are sample size dependent. This allowed us to simu—
late larger sample sizes without loss of information about variants
with really small minor allele frequencies. For the association ana—
lysis, we used the multi—loci rare variant test SNP—set Kernel
Association Test (SKAT) (Wu et al. 2011). This is a flexible regres-
sion approach, which is able to incorporate population specific
covariates. As covariates, we included principal components ob—
tained either from genetic covariance matrix or from Jaccard simi-
larity matrix or ancestry estimates obtained from ADMIXTURE.
We expect the top three principal components to distinguish be—
tween the four subpopulations, so we used three principal compo—
nents or ancestry estimates as covariates. As recommended by Price
et al. we also included a setting with 10 principal components as
covariates based on the genetic covariance matrix or the Jaccard
similarity matrix.

In each replication, we considered three categories of SNPs: train—
ing SNPs, null SNPs and causal SNPs. Category 1 and 2 were simu—
lated without any disease model, i.e. without genetic effect on the
phenotype, whereas for category 3 we considered a multiplicative dis—
ease model with a relative risk of 2 for every SNP. Within each cat—
egory, we randomly generated 100 000 SNPs for a given MAF cutoff
from the drawn allele frequencies. In total that resulted in 300 000 in—
dependent SNPs. The proportions of simulated individuals coming
from four populations, which mimic the four European populations
were kept as following: (0.4, 0.1, 0.1 and 0.4) for cases and (0.1, 0.4,
0.4 and 0.1) for controls. Category 1 was used for population struc—
ture identification and the other 2 categories were used for association
analysis, where we divided the 100 000 SNPs into 1000 groups, which
are supposed to represent genes or regions of interest. We then per-
formed the variance—component test SKAT on each group and assessed
the type 1 error and power with the nominal significance level of 0.01.

We performed 500 replications with different minor allele cut-
offs (0.001, 0.005, 0.01) and different sample sizes (500 and 2000

individuals). We report the averaged over 500 replications type 1
error and power in Tables 2 and 3 with SEs in brackets.

The outlined correction for population structure for rare variants
based on Jaccard similarity matrix performed better compared to
EIGENSTRAT and ADMIXTURE. Our method showed great per—
formance in the scenario with the smallest minor allele frequency
cutoff, it was the only method, which was able to control the type 1
error in this scenario. All three methods were able to maintain the
type 1 error under the nominal level in the other scenarios, except
ADMIXTURE in the scenario with 500 individuals and 0.005 minor
allele frequency cutoff. All methods showed similar power, when 3
covariates were included in the analysis. When increasing the num-
ber of covariates to 10, we found that our proposed correction
method did not lose the achieved power and showed the best per—
formance, whereas the values for EIGENSTRAT dropped down.
Overall, our proposed correction method showed the best perform—
ance ratio between type one error and power.

4 Conclusion

Next generation sequencing data is becoming highly available and
numerous methods have been developed to study the association of
variants with low minor allele frequencies with complex traits
(Ionita-Laza et al., 2011; Li and Leal, 2008; Madsen et al., 2009;
Price et al., 2010b; Wu et al., 2011). However, the fact that rare
variants might represent different patterns of population stratifica—
tion is currently underestimated. Recently, several Consortia (1000
Genomes, UK10K) showed that variants with a very low minor al-
lele frequency often cluster within one population. Those variants
might represent ‘younger’ population—specific mutations and, hence,
can be utilized for population structure correction in rare variant
tests.

We propose an approach for the detection of population substruc—
ture in sequencing data that utilizes the information about co—appear—
ances of the minor alleles between individuals. The attractive features
of the approach are its computational speed and its capability to ex—
pose population substructure with higher resolution within sequence
data than standard methodology. It requires no removal of long-range
LD regions, when the dataset contains only rare variants. The ap—
proach can be seen as a modification of the EIGENSTRAT approach
in which the genetic covariance matrix is replaced by the Jaccard simi—
larity matrix. Consequently, existing methodology can be used to
guard association tests against confounding due to population sub—
structure. For example, the principal components based on the
Jaccard similarity matrix can be included into the association analysis
as covariates (Price et al., 2010a, Wu et al., 2011), or into the condi—
tional sampling approach for rare variant analysis (Epstein et al.,
2012)

Several studies (Baye et al., 2011; Zhang et al. 2013) assessed the
population structure in rare variants by applying standard PCA,
based on genetic covariance data. Zhang et al. showed that includ—
ing multiple classical PCs based on variants with low minor allele
frequency might lead to power loss (overestimation) in association
analysis. They also showed that classical PCA, when applied to vari—
ants with MAF < 1% is sensitive to outliers and hence isn’t effective
in separating subpopulations. We confirm this in Figure 4, left panel.
Here the second PC is driven by the largest variance of the sparse in—
dividual genotypes based on rare variants.

Our method based on Jaccard similarity matrix was specifically
designed to detect population stratification based on variants with
small minor allele frequencies. We can see that due to sparsity of data—
sets with rare variants standard covariance—based methods fail to

detect population structure. Given the imminent arrival of large-scale
whole genome sequencing (WGS) studies, there is a urgent need for
methods that account for population structure in datasets with rare
variants. We evaluated our approach by simulation studies and by ap—
plication to the 1000 Genomes Project data. Our empirical evidence
based on the application to the 1000 Genomes Project Data and simu—
lation studies suggests that the proposed methodology provides a finer
resolution picture of population substructure than existing method—
ology. The simulation studies show that our method is able to achieve
equal or higher power in most of the simulated scenarios, while main—
taining the type 1 error under the nominal level. Overall, our method
did not lose the power, when increasing the number of principal com-
ponents, included in the analysis, in comparison the classical PCA.
This is an important feature for real data analysis with big sample
sizes.

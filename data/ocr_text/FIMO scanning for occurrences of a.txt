ABSTRACT

Summary: A motif is a short DNA or protein sequence that
contributes to the biological function of the sequence in which
it resides. Over the past several decades, many computational
methods have been described for identifying, characterizing and
searching with sequence motifs. Critical to nearly any motif-based
sequence analysis pipeline is the ability to scan a sequence database
for occurrences of a given motif described by a position-specific
frequency matrix.

Results: We describe Find Individual Motif Occurrences (FIMO),
a software tool for scanning DNA or protein sequences with
motifs described as position-specific scoring matrices. The program
computes a log-likelihood ratio score for each position in a
given sequence database, uses established dynamic programming
methods to convert this score to a P-value and then applies false
discovery rate analysis to estimate a q-value for each position in
the given sequence. FIMO provides output in a variety of formats,
including HTML, XML and several Santa Cruz Genome Browser
formats. The program is efficient, allowing for the scanning of DNA
sequences at a rate of 3.5 Mb/s on a single CPU.

Availability and Implementation: FIMO is part of the MEME Suite
software toolkit. A web server and source code are available at
http://meme.sdsc.edu.

1 INTRODUCTION

A DNA or protein sequence motif is a short pattern that is conserved
by purifying selection. In DNA, a motif may correspond to a protein
binding site; in proteins, a motif may correspond to the active site
of an enzyme or a structural unit necessary for proper folding of the
protein. Thus, sequence motifs are one of the basic functional units of
molecular evolution. Consequently, identifying and understanding
these motifs is fundamental to building models of cellular processes
at the molecular scale and to understanding the mechanisms of
human disease.

We describe here a software tool, called FIMO (Find Individual
Motif Occurrences, pronounced fe‘mo‘), that carries out in an efﬁcient,
statistically rigorous fashion one of the core functions required
for any motif—based sequence analysis: scanning a collection of

DNA or protein sequences for occurrences of one or more motifs.
FIMO is by no means the ﬁrst motif scanning method; however,
many publicly available motif scanners are either not currently
maintained or lack some of FIMO’s features. Table 1 summarizes
the differences between FIMO and eight currently available motif
scanners. Furthermore, as part of the MEME Suite (Bailey et al.,
2009), FIMO can be used seamlessly in conjunction with a variety
of complementary motif—based sequence analysis tools.

Note that the MEME Suite provides two other motif scanning
algorithms that are useful in different scenarios. MAST (Bailey
and Gribskov, 1998) searches with one or more DNA or protein
motifs against a database composed of relatively short sequences,
e.g. proteins or candidate regulatory regions, assigning a single score
to each target sequence assuming that every motif occurs exactly
once in the sequence. MCAST (Bailey and Noble, 2003), in contrast,
uses a hidden Markov model to search DNA sequences for regions
that are enriched with occurrences of one or more of the given
motifs. Thus, MCAST is designed to scan chromosomes to detect
cis—regulatory modules containing a known collection of cofactor
motifs. Compared with MAST and MCAST, FIMO is simpler
and more general. FIMO only assigns scores to individual motif
occurrences; it makes no attempt to assign scores to joint occurrences
of motifs, to sequence regions or to complete sequences. FIMO
is thus a general—purpose tool for identifying individual candidate
binding sites or protein motifs.

2 IMPLEMENTATION

FIMO takes as input one or more ﬁxed—length motifs, represented as
position—speciﬁc frequency matrices. These motifs can be generated
from the MEME motif discovery algorithm, extracted from an
existing motif database or created by hand using a simple text format.
The program computes a log—likelihood ratio score (often referred

to incorrectly as a ‘log—odds score’) for each motif with respect
to each sequence position and converts these scores to P—values
using dynamic programming (Staden, 1994), assuming a zero—order
null model in which sequences are generated at random with user—
speciﬁed per—letter background frequencies. Finally, FIMO employs
a bootstrap method (Storey, 2002) to estimate false discovery rates
(FDRs). Because the FDR is not monotonic relative to the P—value,
FIMO instead reports for each P—value a corresponding q—value,
which is deﬁned as the minimal FDR threshold at which the P—value
is deemed signiﬁcant (Storey, 2003).

FIMO produces as output a ranked list of motif occurrences, each
with an associated log—likelihood ratio score, P—value and q—value.
This list is represented in multiple ways: as an HTML report, as an
XML ﬁle in CisML format (Haverty and Weng, 2004), as a plain
text ﬁle and as tab—delimited ﬁles in formats suitable for input to the
UCSC Genome Browser (.gff and .wig).

The FIMO web server allows the user to upload one or more
motifs and then search either a user—supplied sequence ﬁle or one
of 3102 single and multiorganism DNA and protein databases from
Ensembl and Genbank. Search results are stored online, and the user
is notiﬁed of their availability via email.

3 EXAMPLE

To demonstrate FIMO’s functionality, we searched the human
genome with a motif for CTCF, a highly conserved zinc ﬁnger
DNA—binding protein that exhibits diverse regulatory functions and
that plays a major role in the global organization of the chromatin
architecture of the human genome (Phillips and Corces, 2009).
Figure 1 shows the FIMO HTML output for the top— scoring predicted
occurrences of the motif, and a precision—recall curve comparing
the predicted CTCF binding sites with a gold standard derived from

a ChIP—seq experiment (see Supplementary Material for details).
Overall, FIMO identiﬁed 8647 candidate binding sites with q < 0.05.
The precision—recall curve suggests that the top of the list is enriched
with sites that overlap ChIP—seq peaks. Note that the absolute
precision is low, presumably for two reasons: ﬁrst, a single motif
lacks sufﬁcient information to reliably scan an entire eukaryotic
genome with high precision; second, FIMO identiﬁes many bona
ﬁde CTCF binding sites that are not active in the particular cell
type in which the ChIP—seq experiment was carried out. Scanning
the entire human genome took 30 min 10 s of wall clock time on an
Intel Xeon 2.2 GHz CPU, equivalent to scanning 3.5 Mp/s.

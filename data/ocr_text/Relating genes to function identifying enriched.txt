ABSTRACT

Motivation: Biological analysis has shifted from identifying genes and
transcripts to mapping these genes and transcripts to biological func-
tions. The ENCODE Project has generated hundreds of ChlP-Seq ex-
periments spanning multiple transcription factors and cell lines for
public use, but tools for a biomedical scientist to analyze these data
are either non-existent or tailored to narrow biological questions. We
present the ENCODE ChlP-Seq Significance Tool, a flexible web ap-
plication leveraging public ENCODE data to identify enriched tran-
scription factors in a gene or transcript list for comparative analyses.
Implementation: The ENCODE ChlP-Seq Significance Tool is written
in JavaScript on the client side and has been tested on Google
Chrome, Apple Safari and Mozilla Firefox browsers. Server-side
scripts are written in PHP and leverage R and a MySQL database.
The tool is available at http://encodeqt.stanford.edu.

1 INTRODUCTION

Identifying gene or transcript signatures associated with devel-
opment, disease and drug efﬁcacy has been a focal point of
biology and medicine since the release of the human genome
sequence; however, focus has only recently shifted to relating
these signatures to function on a genome-wide scale. Thanks
to next-generation sequencing assays such as ChIP-Seq that
query an entire genome, transcription factor-binding sites that
may explain the underlying biochemical function behind these
signatures can be identiﬁed (Johnson et al., 2007; Robertson
et al., 2007). The ENCODE Consortium, in particular, has
spent over US$123 million producing and analyzing functional
assays for public use. As part of this effort, ENCODE has
generated 843 ChIP-Seq experiments (including histone modi-
ﬁcations and control experiments) across >90 cell lines from
various tissues, treatments and conditions (ENCODE Project
Consortium et al., 2012). Although ENCODE ChIP-Seq ex-
periments represent an invariable treasure trove of data to
intersect against gene/transcript signatures and identify en-
riched transcription factors (TFs), the Consortium does not
provide a simple tool for this purpose short of downloading

and parsing each results ﬁle individually. Other tools, such as
Cscan, have tried to ﬁll this void, but their conﬁguration
options focus only on transcription start sites (Zambelli
et al., 2012). Additionally, Cscan uses the set of all genes
from the entire human genome as a background set, rendering
it impractical for signatures derived from expression micro-
arrays or from array-capture—based sequencing experiments.
We present the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool, a
simple, ﬂexible single-page web application that addresses
these gaps in existing tools, leverages public ChIP-Seq data
from the ENCODE Production Phase and provides biomed-
ical researchers the ability to conduct comparative analyses
with their list of gene/transcript signatures.

2 DESCRIPTION

2.1 Underlying database

The ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool leverages a MySQL
database of ofﬁcial, uniﬁed peak calls from 708 ENCODE ChIP-
Seq non-histone and non-control experiments, encompassing 220
transcription factor and treatment combinations across 91 cell
types. We ﬁrst represent each called peak by the genomic pos-
ition of its apex to minimize the effect of broader peak shapes
biasing our database. The signiﬁcant peak calls and the apex
positions are those ofﬁcially released by ENCODE for unre-
stricted public use. Using all protein-coding genes and transcripts
as well as pseudogenes identiﬁed in the Gencode v15 annotation
along with corresponding IDs and symbols from Entrez,
Ensembl, HAVANA and the HUGO Gene Nomenclature
Committee, we intersected the positions of all ChIP-Seq peak
apexes from each experiment against the start and end positions
of each gene, identifying the closest peak to the transcription
start site (T55) and transcription termination site (TTS). These
values are recorded in the database for each gene/factor/cell line
combination. Peak call ﬁles targeting the same combination of
factor and cell line were pooled provided that the antibody
target, cell treatments and binding context were the same. For
example, experiments using different antibodies targeting the
same carboxy—terminal domain repeat in the large subunit of
RNA polymerase II to identify transcription initiation (e.g.
Covance MMS-126R and abcam ab5408) were pooled, but
these experiments were kept separate from experiments using
the abcam ab5095 antibody targeting the phosphorylated
serine-2 of the same repeat to identify a stalled polymerase.
Experiments using cells subjected to different treatments were

2.2 ENCODE ChIP-Seq signiﬁcance tool

The ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool is a single-page web
application that identiﬁes enriched TFs in gene or transcript lists
and presents the separate results from each list in a uniﬁed view
(Fig. 1). The user begins by deﬁning parameters including the
gene/transcript ID system (Ensembl, Entrez, HAVANA or gene
symbol from hg19), the feature type to use as the center of the
window (TSS/5’-end, TTS/3’-end or the entire gene/transcript
body), as well as the upstream and downstream analysis
window size in increments of 500 bp. A gene list can be compared
with the union of any combination of ChIP-Seq experiments in
ENCODE Tier 1, 2 and 3 cell lines that comprise the ENCODE
unrestricted dataset. For each unique TF/treatment combin-
ation, the ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool queries our
database to identify the number of genes in each gene list with
at least one TF peak apex in the selected window around the
TSS, TTS or gene body. Enrichment scores are calculated using a
one-tailed hypergeometric test followed by multiple hypothesis
correction using the FDR method (Benjamini and Hochberg,
1995; Supplementary Material). Enrichment scores and gene
counts for each TF across each list are shown in a table that
can be saved, printed or copied to the clipboard directly from the
tool. We also allow the user to specify a custom background list,
allowing our tool to be applied to microarray data and other
data not generated from genome- or transcriptome—wide assays.

In addition to identifying enriched TFs, researchers will also
want to identify the speciﬁc genes that have a binding site for a

particular transcription factor. By clicking on any cell in the
results table, the user can retrieve a second table listing the
gene IDs, associated metadata and links to external resources
for each column and row combination. These tables can be
copied to the user’s clipboard or saved to a ﬁle from within
the web application.

2.3 Advantages over existing tools

Our curated database of ENCODE ChIP-Seq peaks coupled
with our web interface offers several distinct advantages. First,
existing tools tend to limit analyses to transcription start sites,
but ENCODE data also include chromatin remodelers, DNA
repair proteins and other classes of DNA-binding proteins that
exhibit more promiscuous binding patterns. By offering the abil-
ity to select whole body or TTS analyses in addition to TSS
analyses, we give researchers the ﬂexibility to explore a wider
range of biological questions. Existing tools also tend to restrict
researchers to a limited range of window sizes near TSSs (e.g.
:l:1kb). Our tool allows researchers to select a window size up to
5000 bp (in 500 bp increments) on each side of the TSS, TTS or
gene/transcript body. Protein-coding genes/transcripts are also
separated from pseudogenes in our underlying annotation.
Additionally, we allow researchers to supply a custom back-
ground list, extending the application of our tool to signatures
derived from methods that do not query the entire genome.
Finally, comparative analysis between gene lists is common in
many biomedical data analyses, but existing web tools often pre-
sent comparisons one list at a time. For a researcher with mul-
tiple gene lists, this often means undertaking a time-consuming
process of processing, saving and collating multiple comparisons
manually. The ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool allows
researchers to enter multiple lists in a single query, calculates
signiﬁcance scores for each list, and presents the separate results
in a uniﬁed table to reduce both analysis time and the potential
for human error.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The ENCODE ChIP-Seq Signiﬁcance Tool can be applied to a
wide range of biological questions. We discuss two examples in
the Supplementary Material: identifying the functional context
of an unknown sequence motif and uncovering possible mech-
anisms of action for the drug dexamethasone. In the ﬁrst ex-
ample, we ﬁnd that the unknown sequence motif appears in
many promoter regions that are enriched for Polycomb group
proteins, indicating genes that are likely repressed or that require
strict regulation of chromatin structure. The unknown motif may
even represent a binding site for a different Polycomb group
protein. The second example shows that glucocorticoid receptor
(Gr) is the most enriched TF among genes that are signiﬁcantly
upregulated after treatment with dexamethasone, an agonist of
Gr. Most of the observed Gr-binding genes are related to inﬂam-
matory and immune disease, demonstrating that dexamethasone
may act as an anti-inﬂammatory and an immunosuppressant
mainly by targeting Gr-regulated, disease-related genes. This
analysis helps identify the possible Gr-binding genes responsible
for the drug action (e. g. the gene NF KBIA).

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Given the growth of large-scale protein—protein inter-
action (PPI) networks obtained across multiple species and condi-
tions, network alignment is now an important research problem.
Network alignment performs comparative analysis across multiple
PPI networks to understand their connections and relationships.
However, PPI data in high-throughput experiments still suffer from
significant false-positive and false-negatives rates. Consequently,
high-confidence network alignment across entire PPI networks is not
possible. At best, local network alignment attempts to alleviate
this problem by completely ignoring low-confidence mappings;
global network alignment, on the other hand, pairs all proteins regard-
less. To this end, we propose an alternative strategy: instead of
full alignment across the entire network or completely ignoring low-
conﬁdence regions, we aim to perform highly specific protein-
to—protein alignments where data confidence is high, and fall back
on broader functional region-to-region alignment where detailed pro-
tein—protein alignment cannot be ascertained. The basic idea is to pro-
vide an alignment of multiple granularities to allow biological
predictions at varying specificity.

Results: DualAligner performs dual network alignment, in which
both region-to—region alignment, where whole subgraph of one net-
work is aligned to subgraph of another, and protein-to-protein align-
ment, where individual proteins in networks are aligned to one another,
are performed to achieve higher accuracy network alignments. Dual
network alignment is achieved in DualAligner via background in-
formation provided by a combination of Gene Ontology annotation
information and protein interaction network data. We tested
DualAl igner on the global networks from IntAct and demonstrated
the superiority of our approach compared with state-of—the—art net-
work alignment methods. We studied the effects of parameters in
DualAligner in controlling the quality of the alignment. We also
performed a case study that illustrates the utility of our approach.

1 INTRODUCTION

Protein—protein interaction (PPI) network models the cooper-
ation between proteins to drive processes within a biological
system. Advancement in high-throughput technologies has led
to rapid growth of large scale PPI networks obtained across
multiple species or conditions, and therefore, comparative ana-
lysis to understand their connections and relationships is now an
important research problem (Sharan and Ideker, 2006). To this
end, the network alignment problem aims to align a set of PPI
networks belonging to different species to ﬁnd conserved subnet-
works within them. These conserved regions could explain mech-
anisms of function conservation and evolution beyond what is
available to individual gene studies.

The network alignment problem consists of two key steps: a
scoring framework that captures the knowledge about module
evolution and identification of high scoring alignments (con-
served subnetworks or modules) from among exponentially
large set of possible alignments. Unfortunately, ﬁnding con-
served subnetworks in a group of networks is NP-Hard
(Sharan and Ideker, 2006). Consequently, a range of heuristic-
based network alignment methods have been proposed that fall
into two categories, namely, local (Kalaev et al., 2008; Kelley
et al., 2004; Koyutiirk et al., 2006) and global network alignment
(Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Liao et al., 2009; Singh et al., 2008;
Zaslavskiy et al., 2009).

The local network alignment approach identiﬁes multiple
unrelated conserved regions between the input networks, each
region implying a mapping independent of others. It is particu-
larly useful in ﬁnding known functional components (pathways,
complexes) in a new species. For instance, PathBLAST (Kelley
et al., 2004) aligns linear pathways based on homology and inter-
action conﬁdence. NetworkBLAST —M (Kalaev et al., 2009) ﬁnds
highly conserved local regions greedily using inferred phylogeny.
Another local alignment method is MaWi sh (Koyutiirk et al.,
2006), which is modeled on evolution of protein interactions.

On the other hand, the global network alignment approach
aligns every node in the smaller network to the larger network
to ﬁnd ‘best’ overall alignment between the input networks.
Particularly, it enables species-level comparisons and discovery
of functional orthologs. For instance, IsoRank (Singh et al.,
2008) and IsoRankN (Liao et al., 2009) identify a stationary
random walk distribution to perform global network alignment.

ments to learn phylogeny relationships before performing an

alignment. MI—GRAAL (Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011) is an align-
ment framework that could integrate multiple similarity meas-
ures to construct a global alignment. Zaslavskiy et al. (2009)
model global network alignment as a graph matching problem
with hard constraints given by a set of must-link pairs of proteins.
These must-link pairs are identiﬁed by sequence orthologs.

More recently, the ILP-based Natalie proposes a
Lagrangian relaxation approach to solve the problem approxi-
mately (Pache and Aloy, 2012). PINALOG combines both the
similarities of protein sequence and protein function to compute
an alignment between two PPI networks (Phan and Sternberg,
2012). To this end, the Gene Ontology (GO) function similarity
and sequence similarity are obtained independently and then
combined using a linear combination of the independent simila-
rities weighted by a factor 9.

Despite considerable progress made by the bioinformatics
community in devising high-quality network alignment strate-
gies, state-of—the-art network alignment techniques suffer from
a key drawback. Speciﬁcally, they depend on protein sequence
similarity to facilitate network alignment. Unfortunately, se-
quence similarity is only relevant to a subset of highly conserved
proteins, leaving signiﬁcant network regions poorly speciﬁed by
sequence homology. Furthermore, it is well known that struc-
tural information of PPI networks suffers either from high false-
positive rate of current high-throughput experiments or from
false negatives because of incomplete data (Huang and Bader,
2009). Consequently, in significant regions of a network, high-
confidence alignment of proteins is not possible. At best, local
network alignment attempts to alleviate this problem by com-
pletely ignoring low-conﬁdence mappings; global network align-
ment, on the other hand, pairs all proteins regardless.

In this article, we address the aforementioned limitation by
taking a G0 annotation-driven ‘dual alignment’ (Here ‘dual’
refers to the two-step alignment process and not duality in opti-
mization) strategy to align a pair of PPI networks. Instead of
only performing protein-to-protein alignments, we perform high
granularity protein-to-protein alignment where conﬁdence is
high and more general functional region-to-region alignment
where detailed protein—protein alignment cannot be ascertained,
which may still yield biologically informative conclusions.
Consequently, our method not only aligns highly conserved pro-
tein pairs but also aligns functional subgraphs of one network
to functional subgraphs of another. Informally, a functional
subgraph is a connected component of the network whose
nodes share a particular biological role or function (annotated
using G0).

The region-to-region and protein-to-protein alignments in our
dual alignment strategy are not independent of each other, but
inextricably linked. Speciﬁcally, region-to-region alignment sets
the foundation for broad associations between functional re-
gions. On the other hand, protein-to-protein alignment speciﬁes
detailed associations between nodes within each associated re-
gions. Figure 1 illustrates with an example on how functionally
conserved subgraphs are ﬁrst aligned, followed by alignment of
the underlying interaction structure. First, functional subgraphs
of the networks are identiﬁed. For instance, a subgraph that
shares the transport role is identiﬁed in the human network.
Alignment between pairs of functional subgraphs is carried out
and high-conﬁdence pairs are identiﬁed based on the structural

computes a region-to-region alignment that best matches function-

involves pairwise subgraph-to-subgraph subalignment to identify opti-
mally conserved subgraph pairs. Here, three pairwise alignments (fl, f2
and f3) are shown. Note that [(7 and K8 are not chosen in the alignment—
only best conserved regions are aligned. (d) DualAligner computes
fme-grained protein-to-protein alignment using the aligned regions in
(c) as background information. Protein-to-protein alignments are soft
constrained within subgraph—subgraph pairs, that is, any alignment
between two proteins is probabilistically restricted within one or more
subgraph—subgraph pairs in (c)

and sequence similarities of their underlying subgraphs. For
instance, f2 in Figure 1(c) depicts an alignment between
the transport-associated subgraph and microtubule
binding-associated subgraph, highlighting the connection be-
tween the regions. Using region—to-region alignments, we model
each region-to-region pair as soft constraints that probabilistically
restrict protein-to-protein alignment within the regions.
Following that, protein-to-protein alignments are computed
using these soft constraints as priors.

We refer to the aforementioned network alignment model as
function-constrained network alignment (The ﬁrst step, i.e. region-
to-region alignment, represents function constraints that restricts
the second step, i.e. protein-to-protein alignment; detailed in
Section 2). It is worth mentioning the salient feature of our
model. By integrating the rich set of functional information as
soft constraints with the ‘hard’ constraints (Zaslavskiy et al.,
2009) (e.g. known orthologs) in the alignment framework, our
dual alignment strategy not only limits the search space of ‘un-
constrained’ alignment to low knowledge regions but also guides
alignment of functionally informative regions under a reduced
search space. Consequently, our approach identiﬁes a suitable
alignment from a smaller search space compared with state-
of—the-art network alignment techniques, an important feature
because of intractable nature of the network alignment problem.
Additionally, by leveraging soft constraints, we have much lesser

likelihood of generating alignments that conﬂict with known
biological functions.

Compared with network-based approach, our approach con-
siders both structural and functional information in deﬁning sub-
graphs. Network—based methods rely purely on the assumption
that densely connected proteins are likely to share similar function,
and vice versa. However, there are cases where this assumption
does not hold. In regulatory and signaling pathways, for example,
proteins share similar function without being densely connected.
An example is the MAPKKK cascade pathway. Such subgraphs can
be uncovered via GO annotations but not topology alone because
it is sparsely connected compared with protein complexes.

To realize the function-constrained network alignment prob-
lem, we propose an algorithm called DualAligner that uses
the aforementioned dual alignment strategy, where region-to-
region alignments are ﬁrst made followed by detailed protein-
to-protein alignment. Region-to-region alignment establishes
high-level functional connections between the networks, while
protein-to-protein alignment speciﬁes the detailed connections
within them. We demonstrate the utility and superiority of
DualAl igner over the state-of—the-art global network align-
ment techniques using real-world PPI networks in Section 3.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS

In this section, we formally introduce the function-constrained network
alignment problem. We begin by deﬁning some terminology that we shall
be using in the sequel. The set of key notations used in this article is given
in Supplementary Material S11

2.1 Terminology

Let G= (V, E, (0) be a PPI network where an edge e e E has a positive
real weight a) that represents its interaction strength. Given a GO-directed
acyclic graph, denoted as D, the ordered set A= (A1, A2, ...,A,,) is a
topological sort of D, where A, represents a single GO term. The term
association vector of v e V, denoted by A,, is deﬁned as
A, = (I,(A1), I,(A2), . . . , I,(A,,)), I,(A,) e {0, 1}, such that I,(A,)=1 if
and only if the term A, or its descendants are associated with protein v.
Otherwise, I,(A,) = 0. Note that A, indicates GO terms that are associated
with v.

A function-constrained subgraph Kj=(VJK, Ef, A,) of G is a subgraph
with the following properties: (i) it is a connected subgraph; and (ii) every
node v e VJK shares a G0 annotation A,, i.e. Vv e VJK, I,(A,) = 1. A func-
tion-constrained subgraph (which we refer to as a subgraph constraint for
brevity) represents a constraint on a connected region of G that shares at
least one functional role, namely the role represented by the term A,. For
example, in Figure 1, the subgraph constraint K1 represents a connected
subgraph of the human network such that every protein in it shares the
transcription elongation annotation.

A subgraph set S, = {K1, K2, . . . , Km} represents m subgraph con-
straints on G. Note that typically (119.65,. VJK 75 Q and UKjesi VJK 75 V, i.e.
subgraphs in S, may not form a partition on G and are highly overlap-
ping. The overlapping nature of subgraph constraints does not indicate
conﬂicting functions of its proteins, but rather the multi-attribute and
multi-role nature of proteins. Figure 1(b) shows a sample subgraph set
of function-constrained subgraphs for the ﬂy and human PPI networks.
Observe that the subgraph constraints may overlap (e.g. K1 and K3).

2.2 Region-to-region alignment

Given two PPI networks G1 and G2 with |V1| 5 |V2|, a region-to—region
alignment between G1 and G2 is an injective function rm : .7-"1 —> .7: 2 that

maps Km 6 S1 (a function-constrained subgraph in G1) to K, 6 S2 (an-
other function—constrained subgraphs in G2). Figure 1(c) shows a region-
to-region alignment of three pairs of function-constrained subgraphs. The
transport function-constrained subgraph (K3) in the human network
is aligned to the microtubule binding subgraph (K4) in the ﬂy net-
work, indicating that these two regions are conserved.

To evaluate the conservation between function-constrained subgraphs
during region-to-region alignment, it is necessary to consider protein-to-
protein alignments within a pair of subgraphs. A protein-to-protein align-
ment between two subgraphs will reveal the extent of topological and
functional similarities between them. To formalize this, we introduce the
notion of subalignment. A subalignment is a subfunction subm 2 Vi. —> 
of an alignment Am : V,- —> V]- that aligns a subset V? C V,- of G, to an-
other subset  C V, of G,. To illustrate this, consider in Figure 2 two toy
PPI networks with nodes V, = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5} and V]: {a, b, c, d}, respect-
ively. Figure 2(a) shows a subalignment of nodes from V? = {1, 2, 3} to
V;- = {b, c, d}. Notice that the subalignment aligns the function-
constrained subgraph K3 to K4. On the other hand, Figure 2(b) shows
a subalignment from {1, 2, 3} to {a, c, d}, which is not an alignment
between two function-constrained subgraphs.

DEFINITION 1. (Optimal Region-to—Region Alignment). Given two PPI net-
works G, and G], let rm be a region-to-region alignment function that aligns
function-constrained subgraphs Km 6 S, of G, to function-constrained sub-
graphs Kn e S]- of G,. Let submmn be the best protein-to—protein subalign-
ment between Km and K,, and S ( submmn ) be the score of the submmn. The
optimal region-to-region alignment problem is then deﬁned as the problem
of identifying the injective rm that maximizes:

S(rm) = 2

Km eS,,rm(Km)eSj

S(submm,,)

Here, protein-to-protein subalignment submmn between two subgraphs
can be performed using any existing network alignment algorithms. The
score of the alignment is then S(submm,,). Thus, the problem can be
reformulated as the problem of identifying the one-to-one mapping
between function-constrained subgraph pairs that maximizes the total
subalignment scores.

Figure 1(c) depicts a region-to-region alignment of three pairs of func-
tion-constrained subgraphs and Figure 1(d) shows the potential subalign-
ments between these pairs. Consider the subalignment between the
transport function-constrained subgraph (K3) in the human network
and the microtubule binding subgraph (K4) in the ﬂy network. The
subalignment K3 to K4 is shown by the arrowed lines within the circled
subgraph in Figure 1(d).

2.3 Function-constrained network alignment problem

Given two PPI networks G1 and G2 with |V1| 5 |V2|, a protein-to-protein
alignment between G1 and G2 is an injective function Am : V1 —> V2 that
maps each protein in the smaller network to another protein in the larger
network. For each x 6 V1, let y]- = Am(x,) be its corresponding aligned
protein in V2 given by Am.

Intuitively, a region-to-region alignment shows the functional conser-
vation between the regions of both networks in a coarse-grained manner.
Given such a region-to-region alignment, any detailed protein-to-protein
alignment between these networks must ensure that it is consistent with
the aligned functional subgraph regions (from region-to-region align-
ment). In other words, a protein-to-protein alignment should be guided
by these region-to-region alignments. We shall now formalize concepts to
let region-to-region alignment serve as constraint to protein-to-protein
alignment.

A subalignment subm is said to be hard constrained to a pair of
function-constrained subgraphs (K,, e S,, K, 6 SJ) iff V? 9 V5 and  9
V5 (recall that V5 and V5 are the vertices of subgraphs K,, and K,,
respectively). In this case, we refer to the pair of subgraphs as a hard
constraint. Thus, the subalignment is strictly restricted within the sub-
graph regions speciﬁed by the hard constraint (K,, K,). The subalignment
in Figure 2(a) is hard constrained to (K3, K4), while subalignment in
Figure 2(b) is not.

Observe that it is computationally challenging to identify an alignment
that satisﬁes a large number of (conﬂicting) hard constraints. Therefore,
we introduce the notion of probabilistic constraints on subalignments.
A soft constraint on a subalignment subm is a pair of function-constrained
subgraphs (K,,, K,) such that Vx 6 Vi, P(subm(x) 6 V5) 2 p and
Vx e V}, P(subm‘1(x) 6 V5) 2 p. We refer to the subalignment as
being soft constrained to the (K,,, K,) pair. A soft constraint on a
subalignment restricts the alignment to the region speciﬁed by (K,,, K,,)
probabilistically. We shall later deﬁne a score that is associated with the
probability parameter p. Suppose the subalignment in Figure 2(b) is a
subalignment that is soft constrained by (K3, K4). For every protein in
x 6 {1,2, 3}, it has probability of at least p to being mapped to a protein
in {b, c, d} (i.e. Vx 6 Vi, P(subm(x) 6 V5) 2 p). At the same time, for
every protein in x e {b, c, d}, it has probability of at least p to being
mapped to a protein in {1, 2, 3} (i.e. Vx e V}, P(subm_1(x) 6 V5) 2 p).

A subgraph—subgraph pair (or soft constraint) is a pair of subgraphs
f = (K,,, K,), K,, e S, and K, e S]- such that there exists a
subalignment subm of m that is soft constrained to f with probability
P(f). This subgraph pair models a single region-to-region pairing. Let
.7: = {f1, f2, . . . ,fK} be the set of all subgraph—subgraph pairs, with each
fk e .7: given a certainty score s(fk) oc P(fk). Here, s(fk) reﬂects the likeli-
hood that subgraph K,, is aligned to subgraph K,, and is associated with
the network subalignment score between K,, and K, in terms of both se-
quence and topological conservation.

It is reasonable to remove the top levels of GO terms as they are likely
to contribute little to the alignment. However, choosing the number of
top levels to prune is not a trivial task, as the speciﬁcity of the terms does
not uniformly increase with level (e. g. some terms at level 3 may be more
speciﬁc than others). Instead of a hard cutoff, DualAligner implicitly
weighs the effects of GO terms via subalignment scores s(f). It relies on
computing subalignment scores between GO term-associated subgraphs
to determine its signiﬁcance in functional conservation. Consider, for
example, subalignment between GO term subgraphs associated with
‘Biological Process to Cellular Component’ and ‘Golgi vesicle transport
to vacuolar transport’. It is likely that the former subgraph pairs yield a
poor subalignment score s(f) compared with the latter, which is likely to
have higher percentage of conserved interactions and sequences. Because
the alignment contribution of the subgraphs is weighted by s(f),
DualAligner only weakly consider the effect of the former pair and
strongly consider the latter. Thus, it can effectively discard the contribu-
tion of non-speciﬁc terms in a data-driven manner.

We propose, with simplifying assumptions, a constraint mixture model,
where the overall distribution is modeled by a weighted superposition of
distributions under each constraint fk e .73. The mixing weight for a soft

constraint fk is given by P(fk) =  that is, the probability that con-

 

straint fk is restricting a subalignment of m. The probability of x 6 V1
assigned to y 6 V2 under the constraint mixture model is as

follows: P(y|x) = kaPozlx,fk)P(ﬁ,). The conditional independence as-

sumption is made such that conditioned on fk, the matches are independ-
ent. P(y|x,fk) is the probability that x 6 V1 is aligned to y 6 V2 given
that fk constrains alignment of this pair of protein. Let subm,- be a sub-
alignment that is soft constrained to f = (K,, K,). Let subm?“ be the best
one-to-one alignment obtained. sume-W can be attained using any exist-
ing network alignment algorithms. Suppose an alignment generates a
scoring function o(x, y) for each pair of aligned proteins. Then, we let

the certainty score of f be s(fk) = 2x subm(x)1 + o(x, subm(x)). Under this

formulation, we note that P(y|x,fk) = 0 in most matches compared with
sequence similarity matrix.

DEFINITION 2 (Function-constrained Network Alignment Problem). Given
two PPI networks G, and G]- and a region-to-region alignment rm, let Am be
a protein-to-protein alignment function that aligns G, to G]- constrained by
soft constraints in rm. Let P(yjlx,,fk) =o(x,, yj) if fk =(K,, Kj) e rm and
(x,, y,) e sume-‘ax; P(yjlx,,fk)=0 if otherwise. The function-constrained
network alignment problem is then defined as the problem of identifying
the alignment function Am that maximizes:

P(Am(x)|x) = H 2 P(Am(xinxiﬁank)
xi fk

2.4 The DualAligner algorithm

We now present the DualAligner algorithm that identiﬁes an align-
ment that maximizes P(Am(x)|x) via the aforementioned dual alignment
strategy. The reader may refer to Supplementary Material S1.4 for formal
description of the algorithm. DualAligner is composed of the follow-
ing three phases.

Phase 1: Functional subgraph construction and ranking. Given two PPI
networks G1 and G2, the ﬁrst phase of DualAligner identiﬁes and
constructs the set of functional subgraphs S1 and S2. It exhaustively
identiﬁes for each GO term the induced subgraph of G1 and G2 sharing
that term. Note that an induced subgraph of a GO term may contain
multiple connected components. Our partitioning strategy transforms
each connected component in the subgraph to a function-constrained
subgraph of the GO term. For instance, if the induced subgraph of a
GO term contains ﬁve connected components, then ﬁve function-
constrained subgraphs of that term will be formed. Following that,
pairs of subgraph—subgraph are constructed as soft constraints, and the
certainty score s(f) is computed using the subalignment algorithm (dis-
cussed below). We introduce a pruning parameter ,8, to remove near-
duplicate functional subgraphs. While computing functional subgraphs,
only non-redundant subgraphs are added to the set of functional sub-
graphs. In this study, we set ,8, = 0.9 (remove subgraphs that share >90%
of vertices). The user-deﬁned parameter k is introduced to select only the
top- k constraints for consideration in the next phase. These top- k con-
straints are selected based on their s(f) scores.

Phase 2: Region-to-region alignment. In the second phase, the soft con-
straint pairs are ranked by their certainty scores and subalignment is
performed. Given a pair of subgraph—subgraph constraint f = (K,, K,),
a subalignment constrained by (K,, K,) is an injective mapping of vertices
from V5 to V5. Here, we propose a subalignment algorithm to achieve
this. A pair of protein a 6 V5, v 6 V5 is scored using the following scor-
ing function: s(u, v)=b(u, v) +Aso(u, v). The function b(x,, yj) measures
the sequence similarity score for aligning protein a to v and is deﬁned as
b(x,, y,) = (1 + e‘l’2“/”‘("i’3’1'))_1 , where bscr(x,, y,) is the BLAST bit-score be-
tween the two proteins. The function o(u, v) measures the topological
score for aligning protein a to v and is deﬁned as follows:

o(u, v) = INE ﬂ ME|
NE= {(x, y) : x e N(u),y e N(y)}
ME= {(Am(x), Am‘1(y)) : Am(x) e N(x), Am‘1(y) e N(v) e E2}

where Am is function mapping currently aligned proteins and N(x) are
the neighbors of protein x. The parameter A, weighs the effect of sequence
similarity versus structural similarity.

The subalignment method performs a greedy seed and extension
strategy similar to several existing network alignment techniques such
as MI—GRAAL, Graeml in. First, the best scoring pair of proteins (x, y)
in V5 and V5 is identiﬁed as seed and added to alignment. Using this
seed, an extension is performed by identifying the neighborhood of the
seed, i.e. the vertices in V5 and V5, which are adjacent to x and y,
respectively. The pairs of proteins in this neighborhood sets are ranked
according to their scoring function scores and added to the alignment.
These steps are then repeated until the alignment is complete.

Observe that the pairwise subalignment step can be computationally
expensive when subalignment is performed for every pair. Therefore, we
introduce a pruning parameter y, to remove highly redundant functional
subgraph—subgraph constraints. After ranking each constraint f by their
conﬁdence score s(f), we greedily perform subalignment on the highest
scoring constraint and update the conditional probabilities. Following
that, we prune the remaining sets of constraints to remove near dupli-
cates, such that any remaining constraint whose overlap ratio with f
is greater or equal to y, is removed, i.e. given (K,, K]- , we remove

{(K1, K2) E S:

 

VKr‘IVl< IVKDVKI . .
% _ VS, I214," 2 VS from the set S. This 1s re-
1 J

peated until S is empty.

Phase 3: Expanded protein-to-protein alignment. In the ﬁnal phase, we
extend the coverage of protein—protein alignment beyond richly anno-
tated regions. Phases 1 and 2 of the alignment align only proteins that
have GO annotations. Thus, unannotated proteins could not be aligned
yet. This phase enables alignment of such proteins by using Phase 2
aligned proteins as seeds, and then identiﬁes all remaining unaligned
proteins and ranks them pairwise by their scoring function o(u, v) score
with reference to the seeds. Following that, each ranked pair, starting
from the highest scoring pair, is added to the alignment. Finally, the
remaining unaligned proteins are aligned based on the topological con-
servation with respect to the seeds.

The worst-case time complexity of DualAligner is 0(a(| V|) + |S|2
|VI3) (Supplementary Material S1.5).

3 RESULTS

The Dua 1A1 igner algorithm is implemented in Scala. We now
present the experiments conducted to study the performance of
DualAl igner and report some of the results here (additional
results are in Supplementary Material S1.6). The experiments
were conducted on a 1.66 GHz Intel Core 2 Duo T5450 machine
with 3 GB memory. We align the PPI networks of the global
human, ﬂy and yeast (Table 1). We use GO annotations that
are part of the IntAct species dataset. No other annotations
were used.

Evaluation criteria. We use several criteria to evaluate the per-
formance of Dua 1A1 igner. We deﬁne the coverage of an align-
ment m between two networks G1 and G2, denoted as cov(m), as
the fraction of protein pairs aligned by an alignment method.
That is, cov(m) = |m|/min(|V1|, |V2|), where |m| is the number of
protein pairs aligned in m. Observe that cov(m) = 1 if the align-
ment m is a one-to-one mapping of V1 to V2.

To measure the structural similarity of an alignment m
between two networks G1 and G2 with cov(m) 5 1, we propose
a modiﬁed version of the edge correctness (EC) measure
(Kuchaiev and Przulj, 2011; Zaslavskiy et al., 2009). Given G1,

G2 and alignment m, the EC measure is deﬁned as

= E1SETﬂE2SET
EC —IE2SET| where

E1SET={(x, y) : (x, y) e E1}
E2SET= {(Am_1(x), Am_1(y)) : (x, y) e E2}

Observe that EC indicates the fraction of correctly aligned edges
among the proteins that are aligned (E2SET is restricted by
domain of Am). Unlike the standard EC measure that is only
useful for full coverage alignment, this modiﬁed measure can be
used for not only global alignment results but also local align-
ments (i.e. alignments with cov(m) < 1.0).

To measure the sequence similarity of an alignment m between
G, and G2, we propose the average normalized bit-score measure
as follows:

bitscr(x, y)
(bitscr(x, x)bitscr()/, 32))—

 

ANBS(G1, G2, m)= |m|_1 Z

(x,y)em

1/2 (1)

Observe that it is simply the average normalized BLAST bit-
score of the paired proteins in m. A high ANBS score implies
that sequence homologs are well matched, whereas low score
implies that sequence homologs are not being matched. We do
not report the variance of the ANBS scores because it does not
indicate alignment quality (even in an optimal alignment, the
ABNS variance can be high). Lastly, to measure the biological
function quality of an alignment m, we use a modiﬁed functional
coherence measure (Singh et al., 2008) that incorporates the
speciﬁcity of the GO terms:

FC(G1,G2,m)=|m|_1 Z maxspecificity(AxﬂAy) (2)

(x,y)em

where Ax and A, are the GO terms associated with proteins x and
y, respectively, and maxspecificity(-) measures the most speciﬁc
GO term shared by x and y:

M (3)

maxspecificity(X) = max 1 —
AiEX

Identiﬁcation of conserved regions through region-to-region
alignment. We ﬁrst demonstrate the importance of region-
to-region alignment for network alignment. Recall that in a
region-to-region alignment, pairs of subgraphs from both net-
works indicate conservation at a broader granularity. That is,
the subgraph as whole is deemed to be functionally conserved
with allowance for protein and topological differences. Here, we
evaluate several high-scoring region-to-region alignments. A few
of these conserved subgraphs are depicted in Figure 3 (see also

region-to-region alignment statistics in Supplementary Material
S1.3). Each pair of subgraphs separated by the dashed lines rep-
resents a functional subgraph of the human network matched to
its yeast network counterpart. Observe that while several region-
to-region alignments contain a high-conﬁdence one-to-one
protein alignments, such as the conserved NATl-ARDl-NATS
acetyl trans ferase subgraph, other region-to-region align-
ments do not admit a proper one-to-one protein alignment.
Furthermore, the COG complex, which plays an important role
in intra-Golgi trafﬁcking, is well conserved between yeast and
human network. However, COGl, COG2 and COG7 are structur-
ally unique to mammalian cells and are not homologous to their
yeast counterpart (Ungar et al., 2002), which imply that no in-
dividual pairing between COGl, COG2 and COG7 could exist.
This partially explains the minor differences between the sub-
graphs and also justifying the need for region-to-region align-
ment in addition to individual protein-to-protein alignment.

We also note that the proteosome core complex is conserved.
This complex is known to be ubiquitous and highly conserved in
eukaryotes. Other relationships can be inferred from well-aligned
subgraphs. For instance, transport mechanisms are found to
be highly conserved between human and yeast. In summary,
well-aligned regions show important conservation relationships
between complex—complex, complex—function and function—
process.

Global protein-to—protein alignment. Next, we compare the per-
formance of DualAligner with the following state-of—the-art
global network alignment methods: IsoRank (Singh et al.,
2008), IsoRankN (Liao et al., 2009), MI—GRAAL (Kuchaiev
and Przulj, 2011), Natalie (Klau, 2009), PINALOG (Phan
and Sternberg, 2012), Shih2012 (Shih and Parthasarathy,
2012) and PISwap (Chindelevitch et al., 2013). We ran align-
ments between the global yeast and human networks as well as
between the global ﬂy and yeast networks. We set min = 3,
A, = 0.8 and ,6, = 0.9. We vary the parameter k to obtain align-
ments of varying coverage. For IsoRank and IsoRankN, we
used the standard settings recommended by the tool with
a = 0.8. We use the default parameters for PINALOG, and for
Natalie we chose the setting with highest EC value. For
MI—GRAAL, we enabled signatures, sequences and degrees cost
matrices. To use PISwap as an independent method, we use the
Hungarian method to obtain a best matching based on sequence
homology as input. For Shih2012, we set trade-off parameter
to 50. Note that PATH (Zaslavskiy et al., 2009) suffers from
scalability problem as highlighted in (Kuchaiev and Przulj,
2011), and as a result it failed to complete the alignment of the
human and yeast global networks within 24 h.

Figure 4 plots the results of the alignment between the global
human and yeast networks, comparing DualAl igner to exist-
ing methods. In each ﬁgure, the scores obtained using
DualAl igner are indicated by a line because we obtain
multiple instances of network alignments with different
coverage. While no methods are superior on all measures,
DualAl igner is among the best performer in each measure
(when compared with another method having the same cover-
age). It achieves the best balance of edge correctness, sequence
similarity and functional coherence by being the best or close to
the best performer in each measure. DualAl igner outperforms
all methods except MI—GRAAL based on EC. On the other hand,
DualAl igner signiﬁcantly outperforms MI—GRAAL based
on average normalized bit-score. It also outperforms all
methods in functional coherence. Notice that at lower coverage,
DualAl igner even outperforms other methods in both meas-
ures. Finally, DualAligner outperforms Natalie, PINALOG,
IsoRank and PISwap on all measures. Thus, our approach can
be used to obtain high-quality alignments if maximizing coverage
is not a requirement.

Figure 5 plots the results of alignment between the global ﬂy
and yeast networks. Similar to the preceding comparison,
DualAl igner is either the best performer or close to the best

on all measures. It achieves the best score in FC except
PINALOG. Nevertheless, we urge caution in interpreting the qual-
ity of the protein-to-protein alignments. The global ﬂy network
is highly incomplete and has large gaps in interaction data
(Table 1). This could also explain the low coverage of
PINALOG, which rely on topology-based clustering to align the
networks. The rapid drop in EC and bit-score similarities at
higher coverage is indicative of this issue. In this case, a broad
region-to-region alignment would be more suitable than inferring
detailed protein-to-protein alignment out of the incomplete inter-
action data.

Finally, compared with other methods, DualAl igner is able
to assign conﬁdence scores to matched protein pairs that correl-
ate with alignment quality (by EC, bit-score and functional co-
herence measures). This is demonstrated by its ability to allow
users to control the trade-off between alignment coverage and
quality. Overall, Dua lAligner is competitive with all protein-
to-protein methods while being able to perform region-to-region
alignment that is consistent with existing knowledge. Note that
the ﬂy network is sparsely connected with few GO annotations in
comparison with the human network. Hence, the sequence hom-
ology of proteins may be crucial here for better alignment.
Consequently, PlSwap is advantageous here, as it relies on
sequence-based Hungarian matching.

A unique advantage of DualAligner is its ability to have
functionally interpretable subgraph-to-subgraph alignments.

Table 2. Running times (in seconds)

Shih2012) may not yield functionally interpretable subgraph-
to-subgraph alignment. DualAligner is especially advanta-
geous when there is no clear one-to-one protein alignment
between the subgraphs. In that case, functional interpretation
of alignment between regions can be useful. On both alignments,
DualAl igner is able to achieve almost complete coverage.
Thus, despite not considering isolated proteins, a signiﬁcant
portion of the networks can be aligned.

Effect of As. The parameter A, controls the effect of sequence
similarity versus topology similarity in the scoring model.
We study the effect of A, on the alignments by varying A, from
0 to 400. Figure 6 depicts the results showing its effect on EC and
ANBS scores. As A, increases, the EC value improves while
ANBS decreases. Thus, A, allows a trade-off between sequence
similarity and topology similarity. At low values of A,, more
emphasis in preserving high average bit-score alignment is
observed. The greater the value A,, the greater is the effect of
topology similarity. This effect, however, converges to a steady
state at subsequently higher values.

Running times. Table 2 reports the running times of
DualAl igner compared with other methods. Observe that
DualAl igner outperforms the tested approaches except
PlSwap. Although IsoRankN is designed to scale to multiple
networks, IsoRank signiﬁcantly outperforms IsoRankN in
alignment of a pair of global PPI networks. However, the run-
ning times of IsoRank increase much more rapidly with the size
of the networks. In comparison, DualAligner scales better
with the size of the networks. The Natalie method is designed
to terminate after 3600 s.

4 SUMMARY

We propose DualAligner, a network alignment algorithm
that performs a dual alignment strategy, in which both region-
to-region alignment (i.e. whole subgraph of one network is
aligned to subgraph of another) and protein-to-protein align-
ment (i.e. individual proteins in networks are aligned to one
another) are performed to achieve superior-quality network
alignment. Speciﬁcally, global alignment is achieved in

combination of GO annotation information and protein inter-

proach outperforms state-of—the—art global network alignment

ABSTRACT

Motivation: RNA-seq techniques generate massive amounts of ex-
pression data. Several pipelines (e.g. Tophat and Cufflinks) are broadly
applied to analyse these datasets. However, accessing and handling
the analytical output remain challenging for non-experts.

Results: We present the RNASquxpressionBrowser, an open-source
web interface that can be used to access the output from RNA-seq
expression analysis packages in different ways, as it allows browsing
for genes by identifiers, annotations or sequence similarity. Gene ex-
pression information can be loaded as long as it is represented in a
matrix-like format. Additionally, data can be made available by setting
up the tool on a public server. For demonstration purposes, we have
set up a version providing expression information from the barley
genome.

Availability and implementation: The source code and a show
case are accessible at http://mips.helmholtz-muenchen.de/plant/
RNASeqExpressionBrowser/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Current high-throughput technologies, such as RNA-seq, allow
researchers to generate massive amounts of gene expression data
in short time. However, data analysis and intuitive Visualization
often remain a bottleneck for making the efﬁcient use of gener-
ated data. For biologists with limited programming experience,
accessing data output from RNA-seq pipelines in a meaningful
manner poses a challenge: Manual search for genes of interest is
time intensive if feasible at all, and generating non-automated
Visualizations for a list of genes of interest is a painstaking task.
This task has become even more challenging for highly repetitive
genomes like barley (The International Barley Sequencing
Consortium, 2012) or wheat (Brenchley et al., 2012), where de
novo transcriptome assemblies result in hundred thousands of
transcripts. The Tophat and Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2009)
workﬂow presents one of the standard workﬂows for analysing
RNA-seq data and is broadly applied in life sciences’ research.
Packages to analyse data from these workﬂows that help to
reduce the efforts for accessing the output data are available,

e.g. CummeRbund (Trapnell et al., 2012), RobiNA (Lohse
et al., 2012) or STAR Wang et al., 2013). However, accessing
genes by sequence-information or annotations still requires some
programming skills. Additionally, most tools work only locally,
which makes sharing of the results difﬁcult in cooperative
research projects. In this article, we present the
RNASquxpressionBrowser, a web-based tool that can be used
to easily access the results of expression analysis.

2 METHODS

A crucial requirement for analysing expression data is to establish efﬁ-
cient methods for accessing genes of interest. RNASquxpressionBrowser
tackles this issue by enabling several search methods: It allows searching
genes by gene annotation [e.g. Gene Ontology (Gene Ontology
Consortium, 2004), Interpro], keyword search or Via sequence similarity.
In addition, the user can provide a list of genes as an input to inspect and
download underlying expression values.

2.1 Data schema

High-throughput data from gene expression assays can be loaded, as long
as they can be represented in a matrix-like format, with rows containing
feature information (genes or isoforms) and columns harbouring
sample information. We tested on output generated by Cuffdiff to calcu-
late the expression of transcripts serving as input for the
RNASquxpressionBrowser, but, in principle, other formats that repre-
sent gene expression can be integrated. Following Cufﬂinks’ notation, an
experiment comprises a set of conditions (e.g. tissues, time points or
treatments). One condition contains the summarized expression of one
or more replicates. In Cufﬂinks, for each condition, all the transcripts are
represented by fragments per kilobase of transcript per Million mapped
reads value. In the RNASquxpressionBrowser, several types of annota-
tions can be provided for querying the genes (e.g. GO terms, domains and
links to other databases).

2.2 Implementation and installation

The open-source software is intended to run on a Linux operating system
and was implemented in the programming language Python. A MySQL
database serves as a back-end, with Google Visualization API and
J avascript as main technologies for data representation. For each experi-
ment, a separate database, containing expression information and anno-
tation, is created. For installing the RNASquxpressionBrowser, a
Python-based installation script is provided.

2.3 Finding genes of interest

Within a particular experiment, genes can be searched by using several
options: users can search by gene identiﬁers, keywords or annotation
information (e.g. GO, Interpro). Because gene homology is often used
for ﬁnding genes of interest, RNASquxpressionBrowser also provides a
sequence similarity search using BLAST (Altschul et al., 1997). Genes
that have been retrieved by the search are listed on a search results page
together with their colour-coded expression values (Fig. 1).

2.4 Single gene reports

After selecting a gene from the search results page, a detailed gene report
is shown, which contains a graphical and tabular summary of the expres-
sion data. Furthermore, annotation information and links to external
databases are automatically included if provided during the installation.

2.5 Show case data

As a show case, the IBSC Barley expression data (The International
Barley Sequencing Consortium, 2012) were used. These data comprise
expression from eight tissues and annotations based on GO and Interpro.
To demonstrate the linkage to external databases, we include links to
MIPS PlantsDB (Nussbaumer et al., 2013). This show case is also pro-
vided in the installation package.

3 DISCUSSION AND CONCLUSION

Detecting candidate genes that are differentially expressed in a
particular condition is an important and frequently used route to
approach genes involved in processes of interest. Good expres-
sion data are one aspect on the route to approach genes of inter-
est, but of equal importance are robust methods for detecting
them (e.g. Anders and Huber, 2010; Robinson et al., 2010;
Trapnell et al., 2013). RNASquxpressionBrowser provides
a bridge between preprocessing and the ﬁnal steps of the

analysis. While many researchers report their ﬁndings in a
spreadsheet format, an interactive application like RNASeq-
ExpressionBrowser enables to efﬁciently access existing informa-
tion about predicted genes and their functions. In addition, it
allows linking the data to existing databases. We are conﬁdent
that for the broader community, this tool will be beneﬁcial for
their work with transcriptomics data.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Studying the interplay between gene expression
and metabolite levels can yield important information on the
physiology of stress responses and adaptation strategies. Performing
transcriptomics and metabolomics in parallel during time-series
experiments represents a systematic way to gain such information.
Several combined profiling datasets have been added to the
public domain and they form a valuable resource for hypothesis
generating studies. Unfortunately, detecting coresponses between
transcript levels and metabolite abundances is non-trivial: they
cannot be assumed to overlap directly with underlying biochemical
pathways and they may be subject to time delays and obscured by
considerable noise.

Results: Our aim was to predict pathway comemberships between
metabolites and genes based on their coresponses to applied stress.
We found that in the presence of strong noise and time-shifted
responses, a hidden Markov model-based similarity outperforms
the simpler Pearson correlation but performs comparably or worse
in their absence. Therefore, we propose a supervised method
that applies pathway information to summarize similarity statistics
to a consensus statistic that is more informative than any of
the single measures. Using four combined profiling datasets, we
show that comembership between metabolites and genes can be
predicted for numerous KEGG pathways; this opens opportunities
for the detection of transcriptionally regulated pathways and novel
metabolically related genes.

1 INTRODUCTION

Changes in metabolite abundances are the ﬁrst molecular events
that follow shifts in an organism’s environment. As the steady state
of metabolism is broken, gene expression changes to reestablish
homeostatic control and to adapt the system to the altered living
conditions. This interlocking regulation between gene expression
and metabolite levels manifests in intricate patterns of coresponses
where metabolite and transcript levels alternately vary consistently
with the behavior of both regulators and targets (Kresnowati et al.,
2006).

Therefore, the elucidation of metabolite and transcript
coresponses can yield important clues to the consequences of

altered environmental conditions on the biochemical level as
well as to the organism’s coping strategies. From the perspective
of biotechnology, knowing which genes affect metabolite levels
is crucial for metabolic engineering since metabolism cannot,
whereas gene expression can, be altered directly. Consequently,
many studies using metabolomics and transcriptomics in parallel
have been performed to monitor development (e. g. Carrari et al.,
2006; Urbanczyk—Wochniak et al., 2003) and stress responses
(e.g. Dutta et al., 2009; Hirai et al., 2005; Kaplan et al., 2007) in
time—series experiments. The datasets from this type of experiments
are now a valuable resource with the potential to ﬁll similar needs
as the widely applied gene coexpression databases (e.g. Obayashi
et al., 2007) for hypothesis—generating research (Saito et al., 2008).

Transcript—transcript (TT) correlations that derive from genes
coding for enzymes that catalyze nearby reactions are stronger
than correlations that derive from genes that catalyze metabolically
distant reactions (Kharchenko et al., 2005; Walther et al., 2010).
When the system is not at steady state, abundances of neighboring
metabolites also tend to be correlated; this observation was used
to approximate the glycolysis pathway from metabolite abundance
measurements (Arkin et al., 1997). The inverse relationship between
metabolite—metabolite (MM) correlations versus pathway distance
was recently shown to manifest also on the omics level during heat
and cold stress responses in Escherichia coli (Walther et al., 2010).

Although interpreting MM correlations is far from straightforward
(Steuer et al., 2003), metabolite—transcript (MT) correlations are
arguably even more multifaceted. First, since enzymes inﬂuence
the reaction speed, metabolically driven correlations are more
intuitive between transcripts and metabolite ﬂuxes than for the
more easily measured abundances. Second, correlations are not
expected for metabolites that are rapidly consumed by subsequent
reactions. Third, other modes such as post—translational modiﬁcation
appear to be more common for regulating enzyme activity
than transcription (Carrari et al., 2006; Gibon et al., 2006).
However, there are many other reasons for correlations between
metabolites and transcripts that do not derive from the underlying
biochemical pathway. In a 2006 review, Ladumer described several
mechanisms in which metabolites can tune gene expression;
they include riboswitches, direct interactions with transcription
factors, regulation of cofactors, chromatin remodeling, chromatin
modiﬁcation and hormone signaling. In plants, the last is arguably
the best known since hormones play central roles in nearly all stress
responses and developmental programs.

With these considerations in mind, it becomes clear that MT
correlations may take many forms exhibiting various degrees of
noise, time lags and conditionality on the studied response (see
Fig. l for examples). Therefore, to detect such coresponses using

combined proﬁling data, methods that can handle these issues and
deliver interpretable results are needed.

1.1 Previous approaches

The most commonly applied method has been to rank all transcripts
according to their Pearson correlation with different metabolites
(Urbanczyk—Wochniak et al., 2003). Hirai et al. (2005) coclustered
transcripts and metabolites and identiﬁed relevant patterns by
manually inspecting the resulting clusters. Bradley et al. (2009)
used a Bayes net to calculate an association statistic by conditioning
the Pearson correlation on four broad classes of metabolites and
the studied stress response. Although it has proven highly useful,
the Pearson correlation has the considerable disadvantage that it is
sensitive to noise and that it cannot detect time—lagged responses.

To cope with delayed responses, lagged covariances/Pearson
correlations have been applied to study the heat and cold stress
responses in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Walther et al., 2010) and
E.coli (Takahashi et al., 2011) and for predicting transcription
factor targets in Arabidopsis thaliana (Redestig et al., 2007).
However, the introduction of the lags truncates the already typically
short time—series and may exacerbate the problem with noise
sensitivity.

Another serious problem with the direct study of pairwise
MT correlations (regardless of how they are calculated) is that
since data are scarce, the large number of false—positives renders
interpretation very difﬁcult. Even with a very good measure, ﬁnding
relevant patterns among millions of correlations is a staggering
task, especially when done in a completely unsupervised fashion.
One approach that addresses this issue is to use multivariate

regression via for example O2PLS (Bylesjo et al., 2007) or PLS
(Pir et al., 2006). These methods relate the entire transcriptomics
and metabolomics data blocks with each other in a single model;
this is useful for interpreting large—scale trends but cannot easily be
used for identifying speciﬁc MT coresponses.

1.2 Our approach

In this study, we aimed to design a general method for detecting MT
coresponses that addresses these issues. Speciﬁcally, we demanded
that the method should (i) be able to work with time—series data
with few time—points, that it be robust to (ii) noise and (iii)
time lags and (iv) that it deliver directly interpretable results to
facilitate hypothesis generation. To this end, we introduced two
novel methodological developments: (i) a hidden Markov model—
based similarity measure and (ii) an approach that summarizes
several similarity statistics on the pathway level.

1.2.] Hidden Markov Model based similarity We propose here a
novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM)—based similarity for accessing
the temporal coresponse of MT pairs. We used a particular linear
HMM topology deﬁned by Schliep et al. (2003, 2005). Such models
have been successfully applied in distinct gene expression time
course applications such as querying (Schliep et al., 2003), model—
based clustering (Costa et al., 2005; Schliep et al., 2005) and
classifying treatment responses (Costa et al., 2009; Hafemeister
et al., 2011). The linear HMM can be interpreted as a segmentation
method, where each state deﬁnes an expression range that a time—
series follows, e. g. low or high expression, during a particular time
interval. For example, the model in Figure 2 deﬁnes a prototypical
up and down expression behavior. Given its stochastic nature,
the linear HMMs have been shown to be robust to modeling
noisy and lagged time courses (Costa et al., 2009; Schliep et al.,
2005).

Fig. 3. Schematic of the proposed methodology. For the metabolites in
a given pathway (Step a), we calculate their (direct and lagged) Pearson
correlation with the expression of all genes (Step b). Additionally, we train
a linear HMM for each metabolite (Step 0) and evaluate gene expression in
the obtained models (Step d). Steps (a—d) are repeated for all metabolites in
a given pathway for a particular dataset. To combine multiple coresponse
statistics, we perform OPLS—DA using a set of true positives from a pathway
database (Step e). Finally, we evaluate the results using an enrichment test and
lift—charts on consensus statistics predicted during cross—validation (Step 1).

1.2.2 Pathway-based coresponse summarization Considering the
complex interdependency between metabolites and transcripts, we
reasoned that regulatory patterns may be easier to detect and
interpret on the level of isolated pathways such as glycolysis or the
tricarboxylic acid cycle than when considering individual MT pairs.
Therefore, we propose the use of orthogonal projections to latent
structures discriminant analysis (OPLS—DA) (Bylesjo et al., 2006)
to combine the similarity statistics for metabolites in a particular
pathway. Moreover, this approach can be used to combine different
types of similarity statistics. The results can be used to rank the
transcripts after determining the strength of their association with a
given pathway based on their coresponses with metabolites in that
pathway.

We depict in Figure 3 the method schematic. For a metabolite’s
abundance proﬁle at a particular stress condition (a) we apply
traditional approaches by measuring the Pearson and lagged Pearson
correlation with all transcripts (b). Additionally, we train one HMM
to capture the metabolite’s prototypical temporal abundance (0).
Next we evaluate the likelihood of all gene expression time—
courses with each HMM (d). A high likelihood indicates a high
similarity/coresponse between the metabolite and the transcript.
Note that the HMM also assigns high scores to time courses
with similar but lagged expression patterns. Steps (a)—(d) are
repeated for all metabolites measured in a particular pathway/stress
condition. Next, we use OPLS—DA to summarize the statistics for
all metabolites in the corresponding pathway using the annotated
transcripts as true positives (Step e). To evaluate the found

coresponses, we use both Fisher’s exact test on pathway enrichments
and lift charts on consensus statistics calculated in cross—validation
fashion.

We applied the proposed methodology to study responses to
sulfur deﬁciency (root and leaf tissues) (Hirai et al., 2003), cold
stress (Kaplan et al., 2004) and elevated C02 stress (Dutta et al.,
2009). We also made use of simulated data to evaluate the individual
similarity statistics under controlled conditions.

2.2 Detection of metabolite—transcript coresponses

The application problem concerns scoring the coresponse between a pair
of transcripts and metabolites, (xg,ym) in a given stress response. For this,
we use a series of statistics that measure the similarity between temporal
expression/abundances. Moreover, as distinct similarity statistics measure
distinct similarity properties of a pair of time courses, we investigate the use
of either individual statistics or their combination, as described below.

2.2.] Pearson correlation For a pair of gene expression and metabolite
abundance time courses (xg,ym), the Pearson correlation can be estimated as

23:] (xg,t _ ngxme _ Mym)
(I’l— I)ngSym

where uxg =ZtTZngJ/T, My”, =ZtT=1Ym,z/Ta ng =ZtT=1(xgat Tﬂxg)2/T
and Sym =Z?:1(ym,t—iiym )2 / T . PC(xg,ym) will have values in the range
[— 1, 1], where 0 indicates no correlation, 1 a perfect positive correlation and
—1 a perfect negative correlation.

 

PC(xg,ym)= (1)

2.2.2 Logged Pearson correlation The lagged Pearson correlation can be
estimated by introducing shifts in the original time courses and estimating
the Pearson correlation with the above—deﬁned formula. More formally, the

shifted pair (xgl),y,(,?) with a lag l is obtained for positive lags as fl):

{ym,l+1,...,ym,T} and xg)={xm,1,...,xm,r_l} and for negative lags as 32?:
{ym,1,...,ym,T_l} and x%)={xm,l+1,...,xmaT}. The lag Pearson correlation

(LPC) is estimated as

LPc(xg,ym)= Pc(x;’>,yf.?). (2)

l={L—t/21,m, Lt/ZJ}
Correspondingly, one can estimate the optimal time lag as

Lag LPC(xg,ym)= argmax PC(xg),y,S?). (3)
l={|_—t/2j,...,|_t/2j}

2.2.3 Linear HMMs An HMM is a probabilistic function of a Markov

Chain. It is deﬁned by a set of states S, the transition probabilities aij for

moving from state i to j and the emission densities f,- attached to the i—th state

(see Rabiner, 1989, for details). We use HMM with a linear topology, i.e. each

state has a self—transition and a transition to the next state (Fig. 2). The model
also has a start and end state to force the time—courses to visit all states at
least once. The emission densities are based on univariate Gaussians with
free parameters [14,0]. To support missing values and noise, we use a mixture
model as the emission function (see Costa et al., 2009; Schliep et al., 2005, for
details). A HMM is parametrized as A=(A, (a1 ...,itg), (01, ...,og)), where
A is a S ><S matrix with entry Clij deﬁning the transition from state i to
state j. The linear HMM can be interpreted as a segmentation method, where
each state deﬁnes an expression range that a time—series follow, e. g. low or
high expression, during a particular time interval. Here, the intensity of the
expression is parametrized by the mean value of the emission density [LS
and the length of the interval is parametrized by the transition probability
sii. For example, the model in Figure 2 deﬁnes a prototypical up and down
expression behavior.

2.2.4 HMM-based similarity To obtain an HMM—based similarity for a
pair (ym,xg), we perform the following procedure. For a given metabolite m,
we estimate an HMM km with the Baum—Welch algorithm using ym as the
training data. Next, we use the forward algorithm to obtain the likelihood
over observation xg under the model Am (Rabiner, 1989). The likelihood
reﬂects the similarity between the HMM trained with ym and that evaluated
with xg, that is

HMM(xg a ym) = POCg  (4)

This statistic will have high values for time—series with high similarities
and low values for time courses with no similarity. Note that the Pearson
correlation also captures negative correlation, i.e. time courses that have a
similar but inverted pattern of expression. Given that the time—series are
normalized, i.e. mean zero and SD 1, an HMM—based inverted similarity can
be obtained by inverting the signal of the gene time course before evaluating
Equation (4). We will call the normal and inverted similarities HMM+ and
HMM‘, respectively.

Overall, the only parameter to be deﬁned by the user is the number of
states. For our previous applications, we chose the number of states to be
at maximum 40% of the number of time points. Given the short duration of
the time courses analyzed in this work, we only consider HMMs with two
or three states, called HMM2 and HMM3, respectively. We also performed
analysis for four states (Supplementary Figs. 81—83 and S8); however, the
results were either worse or similar to HMM3.

2.3 Combining similarity statistics

We summarize the coresponse statistics for all metabolites in a given
pathway, p, to obtain a single statistic, b, that measures the coresponse
between each transcript and that pathway in general. For this purpose,
we chose OPLS—DA as it sets no constraints regarding colinearity or the
distribution of the input data (Bylesjo et al., 2006). Furthermore, a wide range
of diagnostic tools and plots exist for this type of models and this facilitates
interpretation. Let Z be the scaled and centered g xme p matrix with the
similarity statistics for the metabolites in p. Further, let 17 be a column vector
with ones for the transcripts that are annotated to p and zeroes for those
that are not (as deﬁned by a pathway database such as KEGG). Then we
use OPLS—DA to decompose Z into a Iz—correlated part and a Iz—uncorrelated
part by:

Z=EVVT+BOP0+E, (5)

where BOPO approximates the i7—uncorrelated variance in Z and E is the
residual. Our consensus statistic is given by the Iz—correlated score vector
The model is predictive and I; can be estimated for a new Z as well. We
estimate the complexity of the model (number columns in P0) by 10—fold
class—balanced cross—validation and use separate round of cross—validation to
obtain independent observations of Z; to use for evaluation purposes.

The same approach can be used to summarize any number of statistics
by simply augmenting Z with other coresponse statistics. Thereby, we
provide a general way to combine complementary methods for scoring MT
coresponses. In particular, we use this approach for combining the HMM+

statistics with the inverted similarities from HMM‘ or for combining Pearson
with HMM.

2.4 Datasets

2.4.1 Arabidopsis stress response data Four public combined proﬁling
datasets were used to evaluate our approach. The ‘sulfur root’ and ‘sulfur leaf’
were introduced by Hirai et al. (2004, 2005) for studying the transcriptome
and metabolome in leaves and roots during sulfur deﬁciency stress. The
transcriptomics data were obtained from custom Agilent arrays and the
metabolomics data were obtained by untargeted FTMS and targeted high
performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) and capillary electrophoresis
(CE) analysis [42 (root) and 28 (leaf) annotated metabolites and 7342
transcript probes after ﬁltering, 6 time—points in both datasets]. The third
dataset is from a study of cold stress response reported by Kaplan et al. (2007)
who used Affymetrix ATHl array and GC—TOF/MS analysis, respectively
(87 annotated metabolites, 6680 ﬁltered transcript probesets, 7 time—points).
The fourth dataset comes from a study of the response to elevated C02
concentration in leaves by Dutta et al. (2009); it was performed using
TIGR arrays and GC—TOF/MS (76 annotated metabolites and 7138 ﬁltered
transcript probesets, 9 time—points). All metabolites and transcripts were
standardized to zero—mean and unit—variance. Metabolite identiﬁers were
uniﬁed using the MetMask tool (Redestig et al., 2010).

2.4.2 Simulated data We resort to simulated data to investigate the
performance of the similarity statistics under controlled conditions. We
use the impulse model (Chechik and Koller, 2009) as a smooth function
of the gene expression/metabolite abundance response to stress/treatment
conditions. For a particular simulated stress/treatment condition, we deﬁne
an impulse model for each metabolite. We sample a time course from
this function at regular intervals to represent metabolite abundance. Gene
expression, associated with this metabolite, was sampled from the same
function (50 samples). In this case, we also allowed for time lags, that is,
observations can be drawn at previous or later time points than the original
metabolite time course. Noise sampled from a normal distribution with mean
zero and onoise is added independently to each time point from all time
courses. We repeat the same procedure for ﬁve distinct impulse models
representing ﬁve distinct metabolites. We allow time lags from the range
[—2, —1,0, 1, 2]; they are chosen with probability [0.1,0.2,0.4,0.2,0,1]. At
the end, we obtain for each simulated datum the temporal abundance of
5 metabolites and the expression of 250 genes. As the gold standard for
evaluation, gene—metabolite pairs are associated if they were sampled from
the same impulse model. To investigate how the distinct method works in
distinct conditions, we changed the random noise parameter onoise from
0.1 to 0.5 and the number of time points from 7 to 14. For each parameter
selection, we generate 10 datasets. All software and processed datasets can
be found at http://www.cin.ufpe.br/~igcf/Metabolites.

3 RESULTS

3.1 Evaluation of individual statistics on simulated data

To evaluate the individual similarity statistics under controlled
conditions, we applied HMM, Pearson and lagged Pearson
approaches on simulated data. We are particularly interested in
evaluating the methods under distinct amounts of injected noise,
numbers of time points and the presence of time lags. If we
consider only time courses without lag, the Pearson correlation is
overall the best method (Supplementary Fig. S1). Nevertheless, for
the most degenerate scenario—high noise and few time points—
the distinct HMM topologies display similar performance as the
Pearson correlation. In the presence of time courses with time lag
(Fig. 4), lagged Pearson performs best in the presence of few time
points and low noise, but rather poorly under other conditions. The

Fig. 4. Boxplots with area under the curve (AUC) estimates for the
prediction of true MT coresponses on simulated data using HMMs, Pearson
and lagged Pearson. Experiments were based on time courses with 7 or 14
time points and low— (anoise 20.1) or high—injected noise (anoise =0.5).

Pearson correlation performs best when the number of time points
is equal to 14, or in the lower values of gene calls (Supplementary
Figs. S1—S3). This is mostly because of the deﬁciency of Pearson in
the detection of the coresponse of pairs that contains lags in the
time courses (see Supplementary Fig. S2 for evaluation of only
lagged time courses). The two HMM topologies present consistent
results over all scenarios. In particular, they outperform Pearson
and lagged Pearson correlations in the scenario of high injected
noise and few time points (Fig. 4, right—most panel). Note that
few time points and the presence of high amounts of noise are
characteristic of the majority of actual experimental data. These
results reinforce the importance of the HMM—based distance for
detecting coresponses in noisy, undersampled time courses with
time—lagged MT coresponses.

3.2 Unsupervised prediction of speciﬁc
metabolite—transcript coresponses

A good measure for coresponses should give higher values for truly
associated than for unrelated MT pairs. A direct way to determine
whether a coresponse measure lives up to this expectation is to
compare the values for close neighbors in the underlying metabolic
pathways with values for distant pairs. To this end, we generated
an undirected aggregated bipartite graph for all Athaliana—speciﬁc
KEGG pathways by connecting metabolites to enzymes that catalyze
their formation or breakdown. Similar to the methodology of Walther
et al. (2010), we used this graph to classify TT, MM and MT pairs at
a maximum distance of three steps as cognate pairs and metabolites
at a minimum distance of eight steps as non—cognates. We then
evaluate the performance of the different coresponse measures for
discriminating cognate from non—cognate pairs by calculating the
area under the ROC curve (AUC) (Fig. 5). Notably, with all AUC
values close to 0.5 as expected from a random classiﬁer for all MT
pairs, none appeared informative for this classiﬁcation, indicating
that expression/abundance proﬁles contain little information about
immediate associations in the metabolic reaction graph.

3.3 Supervised prediction of pathway level
metabolite—transcript coresponses

The above results conﬁrm the complex interdependency and
difﬁculty in detecting MT coresponses. We investigated whether
regulatory patterns may be easier to detect and interpret on the level
of whole pathways than when considering individual MT pairs.
Using the summarization approach introduced in Section 2.3, we

pathway using each of the considered coresponse measures or their
combination. As a result, we obtain ranks of the transcripts according
to how strongly associated they are with the different pathways
given their metabolite coresponse patterns. It should be noted that
summarized statistics can only be calculated for pathway—level
coresponses since the computation requires a set of true positives.
All statistics were calculated in cross—validation fashion to minimize
the generalization error.

To evaluate these rankings, we ﬁrst used the Fisher’s exact test
to obtain a list of the pathways for which a signiﬁcant enrichment
of truly associated transcripts was seen among the top 1—, 3—, 5— and
10% transcripts for each method and dataset. Of the 119 pathways
(and pathway maps), 50 were signiﬁcantly enriched for at least one
method and dataset at the 10% cut—off level.

To visualize the enrichment at all possible cutoffs for these
pathways, we use lift charts. The lift value is deﬁned as the
observed ratio of true positives divided by the total ratio of true
positives (expected invariant over the cut—off rate for a random
classiﬁer). We use lift values since they emphasize performance
in lower positive call rates; this is important in this application.
Furthermore, because they indicate the relative beneﬁt, they can
be compared across different pathways even though the pathways
contain different numbers of genes and we therefore summarize
them by averaging (Fig. 6). In the sulfur root dataset, HMM2
and HMM3 performed slightly better than Pearson which in turn
outperformed lagged Pearson. All combined approaches performed
better than their individual counterparts and the best results were
obtained with HMM3+Pearson. For the sulfur leaf dataset, the
Pearson correlation gives the worst— and HMM2+Pearson the best
result. On the cold stress dataset, the Pearson correlation performed
comparable to HMM2+Pearson and better than the other HMM—
based measures. On the C02 dataset, all the combined methods
performed comparably with a slight preference for HMM2+Pearson
and HMM3+Pearson. Of the individual methods, HMM2 was
overall best but it notably underperformed on the cold stress dataset.
In general, the Pearson correlation and HMM—based methods
appeared complementary and provided the overall best performance
when used together.

Fig. 6. Average lift charts for classifying transcripts to 50 different
KEGG pathways. The lift value indicates how many times better the
actual coresponse statistic is compared to using a random classiﬁer at the
corresponding cut—off level.

Pathway level analysis provides a direct way to search
for interpretable coresponse patterns between metabolites
and transcripts. To further visualize these results, we performed
side—by—side comparison of the Fisher exact test P—values at the
10% cut—off level using Pearson and the HMM method of choice for
each pathway (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. S4—S7). Similar to
the results seen for the lift charts, it is clear that HMM and Pearson
are complementary, i.e. they show enrichment for distinct pathways.
Moreover, this complementarity is successfully summarized using
our OPLS—DA—based approach, which shows an overall higher
enrichment than Pearson alone.

3.4 Examples of metabolite—transcript coregulation

Although phosphate was the only detected metabolite member of the
metabolic map for photosynthesis (map 00195), the corresponding
transcripts were already highly enriched in the top 3% of the gene
lists from HMM3 with the cold, C02 and sulfur root datasets
(phosphate was not present in the sulfur leaf dataset and plants
were grown on transparent media; this may explain the expression
of photosynthesis genes in the root). At the same cutoff, the
Pearson correlation—based gene lists showed high enrichments of
photosynthesis genes for the cold stress dataset but markedly
lower enrichment than HMM3 in the C02 and sulfur root
datasets (Fig. 7 and Supplementary Figs. S4—S7). Considering the
abundance/expression proﬁles for phosphate and the photosynthesis—
related genes, it becomes clear how HMM3 and Pearson are
distinguished in their priorization of different patterns (Fig. 8a, b
and c). Expectedly, genes that are ranked highly by the Pearson
correlation have patterns nearly identical (or inversely identical) to
phosphate itself. This leads to a high enrichment of photosynthetic
genes under cold stress but much less enrichment under C02 and
sulfur stress conditions where the response of the photosynthesis
genes exhibits a more complex dependency on the phosphate levels.

distinct pathways. In the right plots, we see that the combination of Pearson
and HMM has an overall higher enrichment of pathways than Pearson alone.
PS: photosynthesis; Starch/sue: starch and sucrose synthesis pathway.

HMM3 on the other hand is mostly concerned with the overall shape
of the expression patterns and therefore ranks the photosynthesis
genes highly in all three cases despite their inverted pattern and the
presence of noise. Moreover, delay lag is noticeable in the gene
expression response in the sulfur root and C02 datasets.

The only detected metabolite in the zeatin synthesis pathway
(Fig. 8d) is O—acetyl—l—serine (OAS). A signiﬁcant proportion of
the zeatin synthesis—related genes are enriched at the very top
of HMM3—based gene list but not on Pearson. In particular, the
expression proﬁle of ATCKX5 and DOGTI , which were not detected
by Pearson, precede the ﬂuctuations in OAS abundance.

Another informative example is the starch and sucrose synthesis
pathway (pathway 00500) under elevated C02 conditions. Six
different metabolites in this pathway were detected and our
summarization approach integrates their coresponse patterns with
the transcripts to form a single consensus statistic. This statistic
signiﬁcantly enriches the relevant transcripts at the top of the list
when using either Pearson or HMM3 (Fig. 7). However, HMM3 and
Pearson reveal different coresponse patterns; using them together
results in a greatly improved recovery of the transcripts annotated
to this pathway (Fig. 9). Since the summarization is performed
with OPLS—DA, the importance of different metabolites can be
investigated by looking at the model’s loadings [V12 in Equation (5)].
In this example, HMM3 mainly detects coresponse with maltose
and glucose—6—phosphate, whereas the Pearson correlation is higher
with trehalose and sucrose. When using both HMM3 and Pearson
together, these signals become integrated resulting in a high recovery
of a large proportion of the starch and sucrose synthesis—related
transcripts.

coregulation

The summarization step requires a set of true positives for
weighting the different statistics according to how well they capture

novel metabolic properties and also for genes outside the set used
for calculating the consensus statistic.

4 DISCUSSION

We presented an approach for detecting coresponses between
metabolites and transcripts using combined proﬁling time—series
data. In previous studies, the direct or lagged Pearson correlation
was used for identifying such patterns but as demonstrated by our
simulations, this approach does not work well for short time—series
with strong noise and time—lagged responses (Fig. 4). Our HMM—
based similarity measure performed well also in this most degenerate
scenario but, as expected, not better than the Pearson correlation in
the more favorable scenarios.

In general, both MM and TT correlations are expected to decrease
with increasing distance in the underlying metabolic pathways.
By looking at differences in the correlations between cognate and
non—cognate transcript and metabolite pairs, we could reproduce
earlier ﬁndings (Kharchenko et al., 2005; Walther et al., 2010)
with the C02 dataset for TT and MM correlations, and for MM
correlations with the sulfur datasets (Fig. 5). However, different
from Walther et al. (2010), we could not see a dependency between
metabolic distance and MT correlations for any of the studied
datasets regardless of the used measure. Circumstances such as
differences in experiment designs and analytical platforms may be
causative of this discrepancy. Possibly, since Athaliana is a much
more complex organism than yeast, it could also show less obvious
dependency on the pathways that have been deciphered primarily in
single—cell organisms. Nonetheless, with the inevitably high number
of false positives among pairwise correlations, we contend that
coresponses on the level of whole pathways are both more likely
to be detectable and easier to interpret.

In actual stress response data, we saw similar tendencies as
in our simulation; Pearson was better at detecting direct, clear
responses (Fig. 8a) and HMM was better at more complex patterns
(Fig. 8b—d). In combined proﬁling data, we both expected and saw
many types of coresponses between metabolites and transcripts.
However, the nature of these responses—lagged or direct, noisy
or clear—is not enough for judging their relevance because they
have many possible origins (Ladurner, 2006): each with its own
expected pattern. Therefore, we propose to combine different types
of measures and then to summarize them by looking at a set of true
associations as guiding examples. This approach worked well; the
combined HMM+Pearson methods were best for predicting pathway
comemberships between the metabolites and transcripts on all four
datasets (Fig. 6).

The richness of the interplay between metabolism and gene
expression requires attentiveness when interpreting observed
patterns. While direct coregulation is conceptually possible,
pleiotropic and indirect causes are presumably more likely.
However, observed coresponses may still be informative for
understanding the perception of stress and the events that follow
on a molecular level. We presented three examples of this.

(i) In plant stress responses, photosynthesis is strongly
downregulated to avoid the production of detrimental reactive
oxygen species (Mittler, 2002) while metabolism undergoes large—
scale changes. With decreasing energy production, the ATP/ADP
ratio drops and free phosphate levels increase. These are the
same patterns we observe under cold stress and sulfur deﬁciency

(Fig. 8a and 0). However, under conditions of elevated C02, which
may initially be beneﬁcial to the plant (Kanani et al., 2010), the
photosynthesis rate increases and consequently, phosphate levels
start to decrease (Fig. 8b). This pattern was also detected with our
approach although it is overloaded by circadian rhythmic expression
(Harmer et al., 2000).

(ii) 0AS is a key metabolite in sulfur assimilation and also a
member of the cytokinin (zeatin) synthesis pathway (Hirai et al.,
2005). Cytokinins themselves are well—known repressors of sulfur
uptake (0hkama et al., 2002). The observation of a strong increase
in ATCKX5 expression before the increase in the OAS—levels
may therefore be a manifestation of upregulated sulfur transport
and of changes that follow sulfur assimilation. The coresponses
in the glucosinolate synthesis pathway discussed by Hirai et al.
(2005) were also clearly detected in both root and shoot datasets
(Supplementary Figs. S6 and S7; pathway 00966).

(iii) During elevated C02 conditions, as the expression of
photosynthesis genes increases, carbon assimilation also changes.
As it is a central metabolism pathway, metabolites involved in
starch and sucrose synthesis show complex behavior but our method
still highlighted coresponses between them and related transcripts.
Interestingly, both the Pearson correlation and HMM3 consensus
statistics were informative here but completely orthogonal (Fig. 9).
Furthermore, the OPLS—DA model prioritizes different metabolites,
highlighting that different types of coresponse patterns are present
and that Pearson and HMM complement each other.

Bradley et al. (2009) predicted MT associations by combining
several stress response datasets using a Bayesian approach. As that
methodology was based on the use of Pearson correlations and does
not handle time lags, it would proﬁt from the incorporation of the
coresponse statistics proposed here. The presented photosynthesis
example indicates that combining datasets may be useful also in
our case. However, this appeared to be more of an exception than a
rule since the signiﬁcant pathways overall differed strongly between
different datasets (Supplementary Figs. S4—S7). Furthermore, as
a difﬁculty in combining datasets from completely different
experiments, there typically is a very small overlap of the detected
metabolites. For example, only seven metabolites were measured
in all the datasets we studied. Moreover, combining data will only
capture MT coresponses in pathways affected in the majority of
the studied stress conditions. This may worsen predictions for
stress—speciﬁc metabolite—transcript associations.

Extrapolation of the predictions with additional sources of
biological data, as shown with AtPIN, indicates the power of the
methodology for ﬁnding de novo associations. One interesting future
aspect is the inclusion of further interaction data for validation
purposes and integrative analysis. Moreover, we are currently
developing a web tool over an expanded collection of datasets that
includes genome—wide predictions of MT associations.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: While there are numerous programs that can predict RNA
or DNA secondary structures, a program that predicts RNA/DNA
hetero-dimers is still missing. The lack of easy to use tools for predict-
ing their structure may be in part responsible for the small number of
reports of biologically relevant RNA/DNA hetero-dimers.

Results: We present here an extension to the widely used
ViennaRNA Package (Lorenz et al., 2011) for the prediction of the
structure of RNA/DNA hetero-dimers.

1 INTRODUCTION

Nucleic acids have many important functions in biological sys-
tems, such as information carriers, catalysts and regulators. Both
variants, DNA and RNA, can form complex structures by base
pair interactions. The pattern of Watson—Crick or wobble base
pairs a molecule forms is called the secondary structure. A main
difference between RNA and DNA is due to their usage in bio-
logical systems: while DNA builds a dimer with its reverse com-
plement almost all the time, RNA, being mostly single stranded,
is more prone to fold back onto itself. However, if DNA is single
stranded (e.g. during replication, transcription, repair or recom-
bination), it will also form intramolecular base pairs. There are
several examples where RNA and DNA interact via base pairing,
generating a structure called R-loop. They protect CpG (CG
dinucleotide regions in the genome) islands from being
methylated (Ginno et al., 2012). The stability of DNA/mRNA
hybrids is reported to have an inﬂuence on the copy number
of repeats (McIvor et al., 2010) and can impair transcription
elongation, promoting transcription-associated recombination
(Huertas and Aguilera, 2003). Moreover, during the intensive
search for new functional transcripts, rendered possible by
next-generation sequencing technology, at least 1000 novel
lincRNAs were identiﬁed that may act as regulators of transcrip-
tion, and one possibility to do this is via base pairing between
RNA and DNA (see Guttman and Rinn, 2012 for a recent
review). As a ﬁnal biological example, DNA/RNA hybrids
play a role within the CRISPR pathway in bacteria and
archaea (Howard et al., 2011). On a technical side, RNA/DNA

dimers are often used in micro-array or PCR experiments.
The ability to computationally investigate the properties of the
structures of interacting RNA and DNA molecules would help
in the analysis of these dimers. While a number of programs exist
that can predict RNA or DNA secondary structures (For a
review, see e.g. Reeder et al., 2006) or even their dimers, there
is, to our knowledge, no program that also includes the possibil-
ity to predict the full secondary structure of RNA/DNA
hetero-dimers. This may be due to the lack of compiled energy
parameters, as there are only stacking energies available today.
We introduce here a possibility to predict the secondary structure
of such hetero-dimers within the widely used ViennaRNA
Package.

2 APPROACH

2.1 Adaptation of the Vi ennaRNA package

For the prediction of RNA/DNA hetero-dimers, three distinct
energy parameter sets (RNA, DNA and mixed) are necessary. In
order to keep the changes within the inner recursions of the al-
gorithm minimal, we use 8 instead of 4 bases and 24 instead of
6 types of Watson—Crick or wobble base pairs for the energy
computations. The look-up tables for the energy parameters
grow accordingly. However, this does not signiﬁcantly contribute
to memory consumption. Finally, we demand a ﬁxed order for
the input sequences: RNA ﬁrst, DNA last.

2.2 Energy parameters

Since we are only considering RNA/DNA hetero-dimers, not
co-polymers, we only need a subset of the energy parameters
necessary for the full computations in the RNA or DNA case:
we do not encounter stacking of a RNA on a DNA base, for
example. In contrast, stacking parameters of RNA/DNA base
pairs, multi-loop penalties and the interior loop parameters are
needed. For stacked pairs, i.e. perfect helices, the parameters
have been determined experimentally (Martin and Tinoco,
1980; Sugimoto et al., 1995). Stacking parameters are the most
important part of the energy model, as they account for the
majority of RNA/DNA binding free energy. Unfortunately, for
other mixed RNA—DNA loops no experimental data are
available.

As no high-quality dataset of RNA/DNA structures exists,
parameters cannot be trained, and the performance of different
parameter sets cannot be evaluated. The data we have are not
sufﬁcient to chose a function for the derivation of the energy

parameters (Supplementary Fig. S1), so we simply use the aver-
age of RNA and DNA ER/D 2 (ER +ED)/2 for all missing
values. We are aware that this formula gives an at best crude
approximation of the actual folding energies, but note that new
parameters can easily be incorporated. We hope that the
availability of prediction tools for RNA/DNA hetero-dimers
will encourage experimentalists to provide the missing energy
parameters.

2.3 Inclusion into the Vi ennaRNA package

Our approach to just adapt the energy computations enabled us
to easily include the RNA/DNA hetero-dimer support into all
parts of the ViennaRNA Package that compute dimer struc-
tures, namely, RNAcofold (Bernhart et al., 2006),
RNAup (Muckstein et al., 2008) and RNAduplex (Tafer and
Hofacker, 2008). RNA/DNA hetero-dimers are supported for
both the minimum free energy as well as the partition
function-based calculations. Furthermore, all programs can
read in user-supplied energy parameters. In particular, this
allows to make immediate use of any newly determined param-
eters for mixed RNA—DNA loops, or enables scientists to easily
evaluate different energy models as soon as sufﬁcient RNA/
DNA structure data are available.

3 RESULTS

In the absence of programs that can deal with RNA/DNA
dimers, researchers have resorted to simply treating both parts
of the dimer as RNA. To test the effect of applying the right
(DNA or RNA) parameters to the single molecules and using
explicit RNA/DNA interactions, we chose ANRIL, a long
non-coding RNA that is suspected to have a DNA target
sequence, and one of its putative targets. In order to simulate
the size of the transcription bubble, we chose a sliding window
approach with DNA pieces of length 50, step size 25 for our
computations. Even though ANRIL (1500 nt) is much longer
than the pieces of DNA bound to it, we sometimes observe a
dramatic effect on the structure of the hybrid molecule. The tree
edit distance of the hybrid structures predicted with RNA par-
ameters and with our hybrid approach rises up to 900, and the
structure of the binding site can vary greatly (Fig 1).

Another example for the usefulness of the mixed parameters is
the strand dependency of R-loop formation (Reddy et al., 2011).
A r(GAA)n trinucleotid repeat can form R-loops while its reverse
complement r( U UC),, cannot. The non-symmetric mixed
parameters can explain that: addition of another trinucleotid
will give —4.1kcal/mol for r(GAA), but only —2.6kcal/mol for
r(UUC). In contrast to RNA or DNA parameters, the mixed
parameters can also explain the changes in R-loop formation
of other trinucleotides investigated (see Supplementary Fig. S2).

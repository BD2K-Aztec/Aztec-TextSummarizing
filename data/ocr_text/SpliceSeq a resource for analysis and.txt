ABSTRACT

Summary: SpliceSeq is a resource for RNA-Seq data that provides a
clear view of alternative splicing and identifies potential functional
changes that result from splice variation. It displays intuitive visualiza-
tions and prioritized lists of results that highlight splicing events and
their biological consequences. SpliceSeq unambiguously aligns reads
to gene splice graphs, facilitating accurate analysis of large, complex
transcript variants that cannot be adequately represented in other
formats.

Availability and implementation: SpliceSeq is freely available at
http://bioinformatics.mdanderson.org/main/SpliceSeq:Overview. The
application is a Java program that can be launched via a browser or
installed locally. Local installation requires MySQL and Bowtie.

1 INTRODUCTION

The majority of human genes can express alternative transcripts
as a function of tissue type, developmental stage or physiological
context, and aberrant splicing patterns can lead to disease,
notably cancer. Nonetheless, most analysis pipelines remain
tied to a one-gene, one-protein, one-function model despite the
incisive, high-resolution data now provided by next-generation
sequencing.

Our web-based SpliceCenter resource (Kahn et al. 2007; Ryan
et al., 2008) provides the laboratory biologist with a user-friendly
resource for Visually analyzing the impact of splice variation on
such technologies as reverse transcription—polymerase chain
reaction (RT—PCR), microarrays, RNAi and peptide agents.
However, it does not provide tools for detailed analysis and Visu-
alization of the rich, new data from RNA-Seq. Hence, we have
developed SpliceSeq to fill that gap.

Several other analytical approaches have been used to analyze
the relative abundance of various transcript isoforms in a sample
using the short reads provided by RNA-Seq. See, e.g. Katz et al.
(2010) and Trapnell et al. (2012). Those methods have generally

predicted isoform expression levels by making probabilistic as-
signments of reads to matching isoforms, paying particular at-
tention to reads that cross splice junctions. Some also include
inferences from paired-end insert length. Those approaches have
delivered ground-breaking results, but there are limitations. For
example, many RNA-Seq analysis tools lack detailed protein
annotations that can identify functional impacts of alternative
splicing. Most serious, they do not readily handle genes with
many densely distributed alternative splice paths or splice
events separated by more than the read length (or insert length
of paired-end reads). Those difficult cases seemed rare when we
originally explored transcript databases such as RefSeq, but
more comprehensive databases now show complex splicing pat-
terns for the majority of multi-exon genes. In our own database
of alternative splice forms, ~54% of human genes have multiple
alternative splice events separated by >750 bases, the average
paired-end insert length.

Instead of probabilistically assigning reads across isoforms, we
base our analysis on splice graphs. Splice graphs with exons as
nodes and splices as edges have been used previously in tran-
scriptome analysis for assembly of ESTs and short reads Oiing
et al., 2004). We use them here because short reads can be
mapped unambiguously to the graph, providing an intuitive,
composite View of alternative splicing. Furthermore, recursive
graph traversal weighted by depth of read provides a prediction
of the protein sequences produced by the isoforms, and UniProt
annotations indicate functional elements impacted by the spli-
cing. Our initial implementation of SpliceSeq includes only
human genes and is designed to detect only known exons and
splices. However, the algorithms are equally applicable to other
species and can be extended to detect novel splice events. Those
extensions are in development.

2 METHODS AND IMPLEMENTATION

SpliceSeq is a Java application for Visualization and quantitation
of RNA-Seq reads and their potential functional consequences in
the context of transcript splice graphs. It can be launched from a
web browser through Java Web Start or downloaded for local
installation. The Web Start version allows the user to analyze
preloaded RNA-Seq data. The local version allows users to
process their own samples. A MySQL database and the Bowtie
sequence aligner (Langmead et al., 2009) are required for local
installation.

SpliceSeq aligns reads to a pre-constructed set of gene models
(splice graphs, one per gene) assembled from a reference collec-
tion of splice variants. We currently use Ensembl transcripts to
construct our graphs but can use transcripts from a variety of
sources. Each gene is represented by a single graph with exons as
nodes and splices as edges. Each portion of the gene’s sequence
maps to a single unique location in the graph.

When RNA-Seq data are imported, a bowtie database is gen-
erated for alignment of the reads to the splice graphs. The align-
ment database consists of overlapping tiles generated by
recursive traversal of each splice graph. Tile length is optimized
based on the read length of the RNA-Seq data (or insert length
for paired end reads).

Using Bowtie and the alignment database, SpliceSeq aligns
reads to the graph, keeping totals for the number of times an
exon or splice junction is observed. Raw totals and what we term
‘OPKM’ (observation totals normalized by exon length and
million-aligned-reads) are generated. In calculating RPKM
(reads per kilobase of transcript per million aligned reads), a
given read is counted just once. In contrast, if a read crosses
two splice junctions and three exons, each of those graph elem-
ents is ‘observed’ by the read and contributes to the calculated
value of OPKM.

After reads have been aligned to the splice graphs, two forms
of analysis are performed. First, the patterns of observed tran-
script splicing are evaluated for alternative splicing events.
Events are categorized by type (e.g. exon skip, cassette exons
and alternate promoter). Second, a weighted traversal of each
gene’s splice graph is performed to predict resulting alternative
protein sequences. UniProt annotations are then inspected to
identify protein changes that impact known functional elements.

SpliceSeq has options for analysis of individual samples and
for comparison of matched samples. For individual samples, it
identifies genes with multiple splice forms, classifies splice events
and shows functional elements altered by splicing. Splice junction
reads are the basis for that analysis, and exon reads are used to
confirm the classification of events. In accord with criteria sug-
gested previously (Wang et al., 2008), for a splice junction to be
considered observed, it must have two or more reads that overlap
into each exon by 24 bases. In the comparison option, SpliceSeq
identifies genes with splicing differences between the samples,

classifies the events and predicts biological impact. To compare
splice junction and exon read totals between samples, it calcu-
lates a splice index (SI) value:

samplel Exonl OPKM/samplel Gen RPK
sample2 Ex0n2 0PKM/sample2 Gen RPKM '

 

Sl =log2 (

The SI value identifies changes in splicing that are distinct
from changes in gene expression. A P—Value for each splice/
exon is also calculated using a Fisher’s exact test on a 2 x 2
contingency table (see Supplemental Methods).

3 RESULTS

SpliceSeq provides an interactive interface focused on exploration
of alternative transcripts with the goal of elucidating splicing
changes that impact function. For either a single sample or com-
parison of samples, a spreadsheet-style table of genes is presented.
The list can be searched, sorted, filtered or exported in order to
zero in on genes of interest, types of splice events or impacted
UniProt features (e. g. domains). Above the gene list is a graphical
display that shows the transcript-level splice graph or the protein
form(s) translated from the selected gene. In the graphical display,
color and numerical annotations identify alternative splicing
events. The graph can show OPKM, raw read totals or SI
values for comparisons. The protein pane (see Supplementary
Fig. S1) presents protein sequences that result from traversal of
the splice graph, weighted by observed read depth. The protein
pane predicts the relative ratio of alternate protein species and
displays the functional elements contained in each.

4 DISCUSSION

The importance of alternative messenger RNA (mRNA) splicing
to biological function is sometimes unclear. For example, it is not
yet known how many of the frequent splicing changes seen in
cancer are central to carcinogenesis and how many are a bypro-
duct of it. To address such questions, SpliceSeq uses splice
graphs for clear, intuitive identification and Visualization of dif-
ferences in splicing that affect function. The splice graph analysis
avoids the difficult challenge of disambiguating RNA-Seq reads
in an increasingly complex isoform landscape. The splice

Analysis and visualization of RNA-Seq data

 

graph Visualization simply and accurately presents the expression
levels of transcript elements, supporting identification of known
functional elements impacted by alternative splicing. RNA-Seq
data can be Visualized in a genome browser, but SpliceSeq has
the advantages that it removes intron space, statistically summar-
izes exon/splice expression, adds functional annotations and sup-
ports sample comparison.

We have validated SpliceSeq’s isoform prediction by simula-
tion testing in comparison with the widely used program,
Cufﬂinks (Trapnell et al., 2012). Both algorithms performed
well for most isoforms, but SpliceSeq had a slight edge in terms
of the correspondence between computed and actual splice form
expression in the simulations (On average, SpliceSeq was within
13% of actual concentration versus 15% for Cufﬂinks—see
Supplementary document on Simulation Testing for details).
SpliceSeq performed particularly well on the quantitation of
low-frequency isoforms. That may be particularly advantageous
for application to tumors, which are heterogeneous in non-
standard ways. The strongest differentiation between the two
programs, however, is that SpliceSeq provides user-friendly,
interactive graphics and isoform-specific functional annotations.

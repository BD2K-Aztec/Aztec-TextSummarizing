ABSTRACT

Motivation: In a typical gene expression profiling study, our prime
objective is to identify the genes that are differentially expressed
between the samples from two different tissue types. Commonly,
standard analysis of variance (ANOVA)/regression is implemented
to identify the relative effects of these genes over the two types
of samples from their respective arrays of expression levels. But,
this technique becomes fundamentally flawed when there are
unaccounted sources of variability in these arrays (latent variables
attributable to different biological, environmental or other factors
relevant in the context). These factors distort the true picture of
differential gene expression between the two tissue types and
introduce spurious signals of expression heterogeneity. As a result,
many genes which are actually differentially expressed are not
detected, whereas many others are falsely identified as positives.
Moreover, these distortions can be different for different genes. Thus,
it is also not possible to get rid of these variations by simple array
normalizations. This both-way error can lead to a serious loss in
sensitivity and specificity, thereby causing a severe inefficiency in
the underlying multiple testing problem. In this work, we attempt
to identify the hidden effects of the underlying latent factors in a
gene expression profiling study by partial least squares (PLS) and
apply ANCOVA technique with the PLS-identified signatures of these
hidden effects as covariates, in order to identify the genes that
are truly differentially expressed between the two concerned tissue
types.

Results: We compare the performance of our method SVA-PLS
with standard ANOVA and a relatively recent technique of surrogate
variable analysis (SVA), on a wide variety of simulation settings
(incorporating different effects of the hidden variable, under situations
with varying signal intensities and gene groupings). In all settings,
our method yields the highest sensitivity while maintaining relatively
reasonable values for the specificity, false discovery rate and false
non-discovery rate. Application of our method to gene expression
profiling for acute megakaryoblastic leukemia shows that our method
detects an additional six genes, that are missed by both the standard
ANOVA method as well as SVA, but may be relevant to this disease,
as can be seen from mining the existing literature.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Background

Differential gene expression analyses in microarray studies typically
overlook the important aspect of subject—speciﬁc heterogeneity.
Subjects in a microarray study can have certain plausible biological
proﬁles which are not known to be connected with the primary
outcome of interest and therefore, the subjects may not be matched
with respect those proﬁles in a case—control study. For example,
in an expression proﬁling study with cancer/non—cancer patients
the main objective is to identify the genes that are differentially
expressed between these two varieties, which can lead to the
discovery of potential biomarkers related to cancer. But, this true
picture of differential expression can be blurred by several hidden
biological effects speciﬁc to the subjects recruited in the study. It may
happen that some genes are very highly expressed in the subjects
with a certain biological, environmental or demographic proﬁle
(say, with high blood pressure, regular smoking habits, persons
living in rural environments, persons sharing some hidden racial,
familial or cryptic pattern pertaining to some inherent structure
in the population, etc). On the other hand, some other genes may
be repressed because of a similar reason. These factors distort the
true signals of differential expression and introduce spurious effects
of expression heterogeneity. Thus, many genes which are truly
differentially expressed between the two varieties can get rendered
as silent, whereas many others may be falsely detected as positives.
To complicate things further, we can have a multitude of such hidden
confounders in the study and their effects can also vary over different
clusters of potentially correlated genes. Thus, it is also not possible to
get rid of them by simply modifying the arrays of gene expression
measures using a standard normalizing method. These difﬁculties
pose serious problems in analyzing a gene expression data and can
lead to erroneous conclusions along with a substantial reduction in
the power of the testing procedure.

1.2 Related works

Only a limited number of studies are available in this area, which
speciﬁcally address this issue of hidden variation in the context
of gene expression proﬁling. With the exception of Leek and
Storey (2007), Scheid and Spang (2007) and Listgarten et al.,
(2010), most of the works in this area have considered speciﬁc
types of confounding factors that can produce spurious signals of
heterogeneity in the context of expression quantitative trait locus

(eQTL) mapping. Stegle et al. (2008; 2010) have devised methods
to improve the power of eQTL studies under the presence of
non—genetic confounders (unobserved cell culture conditions, batch
effects, etc.). Yu et al. (2005), Kang et al. (2008a, b), Listgarten
et al. (2010) discuss the use of linear mixed effect models to correct
for confounders from some unknown experimental effects or some
hidden population structure. Price et al. (2006) proposed the use
of principle component analysis (PCA) to correct for some hidden
stratiﬁcation in genome—wide association studies. Scheid and Spang
(2007) proposed a method using ﬁltered permutations of the variety
labels, which borrows information across the genes to identify and
correct for unknown effects of the hidden confounders. Leek and
Storey (2007) introduced the surrogate variable analysis (SVA)
method and discussed its relevance in gene expression proﬁling
analyses. This is treated as a benchmark technique in comparing
the performance of our method. The method considers a singular
value decomposition (SVD) of the residual matrix obtained after
ﬁtting a simple linear regression model to the log—transformed
gene expression data. The signiﬁcant eigenvectors from the SVD
are then used to create a reduced residual matrix (containing
statistically signiﬁcant traces of residual expression heterogeneity).
The eigenvectors of the original residual matrix that are maximally
correlated with the eigenvectors of this reduced matrix are taken
as the surrogate variables. These variables are then used in the
original linear model to test for the truly differentially expressed
genes. Overall, the method is fairly complex and uses a two step
process for the construction of surrogate variables. Moreover, the
method in its current form, is also limited in terms of model
selection, as it uses a very simple regression framework without
considering the effects of each gene and its possible interactions with
the surrogate variable (containing effects of the hidden confounders
on potentially correlated genes and the two sample varieties). This
reduces its applicability to situations where the effect of the hidden
confounders can be far more complicated. In essence, all existing
techniques in the literature address certain speciﬁc patterns of
residual expression heterogeneity and discuss relevant modeling
techniques to compensate for their effects. In this article, we attempt
to excavate the hidden sources of expression heterogeneity by
the more generalized approach of partial least squares (PLS). Our
method (SVA—PLS), due to its inherent principle, can perform the
entire SVA from a more general perspective, by extracting the
maximally correlated projections of the residual and original gene
expression variables to two different latent factor spaces (connected
by a linear relation), thereby ensuring an appropriate estimation
of the hidden variables in terms of a set of orthogonal scores in
the residual space. Also, our method considers a reasonably wide
choice of models, which can potentially explain a large variety of
confounding effects.

1.3 Summary of results

The rest of the article is organized as follows. The next section
introduces our methodology in detail. Results from a performance
study of standard analysis of variance (ANOVA), our method SVA—
PLS and the benchmark SVA technique on a variety of simulated
gene expression proﬁling analyses, are reported in Section 3. Finally,
a comparative evaluation of the three methods is performed on
a real—life dataset from the gene expression proﬁling study of

acute megakaryoblastic leukemia (AMKL). The article ends with
a discussion in Section 5.

2 METHODS

We consider a gene expression proﬁling analysis with g genes and n subjects,
distributed over two tissue types/varieties (like, normal and cancer cell lines
or two different biological conditions). Let the ﬁrst n1 subjects be under
variety 1 and the rest n2 be under variety 2. We start by applying the standard
ANOVA technique on the log—transformed gene expression matrix Y (Kerr
et al., 2000, Kerr and Churchill, 2001, Wolﬁnger et al., 2001 and Kerr
et al., 2002) and compute the ﬁtted model residuals. Let Yl-jk denote the log—
transformed gene expression value for the gene i in subject k under variety
j, i=l,2,---,g,j=l,2 and k=l,2,---,n1 forj=l and k=n1+l,---,n for
j: 2. We ﬁt the following ANOVA model to the data and get the residuals.

YiijM+Gi+I/j+(GV)ij‘l—Eijka (1)

where )1. denotes the general mean effect in the model, G), V], respectively,
stand for the main effects of gene i and variety j and (GV),j deﬁnes their
interaction (characterizing the expression effect of gene i on the subjects
under variety j). Eijk denotes the random error term which is assumed to
follow a N(0, 02) distribution.

The ﬁtted residuals from the above model are then given by eijk = Yl‘jk —
Yl-jo, where Yijo 2% Z Yl-jk, Aj being the set of individuals corresponding

keAj

to variety j. These residuals may contain the traces of subject—speciﬁc
expression heterogeneity, which is independent of the primary variable
signal from the sample types and can confound the true effect behind many
potentially positive genes or can overestimate many silent genes as positives.
In order to extract these spurious differential expression signals, we employ
the PLS technique [Wold (1975, 1985); Helland (1999)]. We construct
two n x g matrices Y and E, whose i—th column contains, respectively, the
original log—transformed gene expression levels Yl‘jk s and the residual gene
expression levels eijk s for all the n individuals corresponding to gene
i (i=l,2,...g). Thus, E=((Erc))nXg and Y=((Yrc))nxg, r=l,2,...n and
c: 1,2,... g. Conceptually, these matrices can be characterized as two sets
of n observations on two g—dimensional random variables E and Y, where
each dimension corresponds to a certain gene.

Our approach is to regress E on Y by PLS, in order to extract the hidden
sources of gene expression heterogeneity. PLS, by virtue of its dimension
reduction and covariance maximizing property extracts the additional signals
from those groups of genes, whose expression levels, contained in the original
gene expression matrix Y, are inﬂuenced by the hidden subject—speciﬁc
effects, contained in the residual gene expression matrix E. Let the matrices
now stand for their respective mean zero versions, obtained by subtracting
the respective column means from their initial versions. We assume that E T Y
is non—null. The statistical regression model for PLS can be written as

E = UQT-I-El, (2)
Y = TPT-I-Ez, (3)

where U =[u1:u2:m:um] is an nxm matrix, containing the m latent
factors u1,u2,m:um in the space of the response matrix E. Similarly,
T = [t1 :t2:m :tm] is another n xm matrix, containing the m latent factors
t1,t2,---tm in the space of the covariate matrix Y. Q=[q1:q2:---:qm] is
an gxm matrix, consisting of the loadings q1,q2,---qm, which measure
respectively, the importance of the latent factors u1,u2, mum in the response
(E)’s space. Similarly, P: [p1:p2:~-:pm] is a g xm matrix, consisting of
the loadings p1,p2, ' ' -pm, which measure, respectively, the importance of the
latent factors t1,t2, mtm in the covariate (Y )’s space. Further, for each i:
1,2,Mi=(ui1,ui2,~nuin)T,Ii=(ti1,ti2,-~Jin)Ta61i=(%1,61i2ww61ig)T
and pi=(p,-1, p12, m, pig)T. Here, 61 and 62 are the random error matrices
characterizing the residual terms in the regression models for E and Y,
respectively.

Now, the basic idea of PLS is to estimate the set of latent factor pairs
(u1,t1),(u2,t2)m(um,tm), one by one, along with the corresponding deﬂation

of the matrices E and Y at each step. This is executed by a process of
alternating regression. For each latent factor pair (til-,ti), i=1,2,...m, this
procedure ﬁnds weight vectors 0 and w in such a way that the covariance
of u,- and t,- is maximized. Speciﬁcally, c and w are such that [c0v(u,-, t,-)]2 =
[cov(Ec, Yw)]2 =maxllrll=llsll=1[cov(Er, Ys)]2.

We initialize E1 =E and Y1 = Y. Now for i=1,2,...,m, we successively
estimate the i—th latent factor pair (til-,ti), by the PLS algorithm presented
below [see e. g. Abdi (2003); Rosipal and Kramer (2006); Mevik and Wehrens
(2007)]. In this algorithm, we use a ocb, to mean a = 19/ Mb”, for any vector 19.

We start by setting it,- =E,-,.V, where v=argmaxc ZZZIEIZJC, tiaold =
(0,0, u e ,0) and repeat Steps (i) to (iv) till convergence [as deﬁned in Step (v)]:

(i) Regress Y,- on u,- to obtain w,- ochTui.
(ii) Compute the updated i—th, Y—space latent factor t,- = Yl-wi.
(iii) Regress E,- on t,- to obtain c,- ocEiTti.

(iv) Compute the updated i—th, E—space latent factor it,- =E,-c,-.

(v) If 2 |t,-j —tij,01dl/l‘ij < 6, STOP; otherwise let tl-301d =t,- and go back to
j=1
Step (i). Throughout, we have used 6 210—8.

Next deﬂate the matrices E,- and Y,- to obtain Ei+1=E,-—t,-bl.T and
Yi+1=Yi—tiplr, where, biZEfti/tfti and piZYiTti/l‘l-Tti. Ei+1 and Yi+1
are now used in place of E,- and Y,- to extract the (i +1)—th latent factor
pair (ui+1,t,-+1). In this way, we ﬁnd the m latent factors from the E and Y
spaces. The use of t in deﬂating both the response (E) as well as covariate
(Y) matrices ensures orthogonality of the extracted latent factors t1, t2, ...tm
in the Y —space, which in turn ensures their estimability in a linear model.
From now onwards, we denote m by pmax to deﬁne the maximum number
of hidden(latent) factors (scores) that are needed to be extracted from the
two spaces. The pmax Y —space scores extracted by the above method can
be characterized as a set of surrogate variables Z1,Z2, ~',Z1”maX that are
optimally associated with the latent factors from the E —space, containing the
hidden sources of expression heterogeneity in the original gene expression
data. The mutual covariances between the extracted latent factors from the
two spaces decrease gradually from the ﬁrst pair (u1,Z1) to the pmaX—th
pair (um,ZPmaX). Thus, Z1 contains maximum information on the residual
gene expression heterogeneity compared the other factors. Now, we deﬁne
a series of ANCOVA models Mp indexed by p=l,2,---,pmax, where p
denotes number the surrogate variables incorporated in the model, which
capture effects of the residual gene expression heterogeneity.

PLS—imputed estimate of the hidden residual expression heterogeneity in
the data. Here, ﬁg is the regression coefﬁcient for Z l in the ANCOVA model
(4). (GZ 1),- and (VZ1)j deﬁne, respectively, the interaction effects of gene
i and variety j with the ﬁrst surrogate variable Z1. These effects measure
respectively, the variation in the impact of the hidden factors (captured
by Z1) over different groups of genes (which may be correlated) and over
the two tissue types (which may affect the primary variable signal). As the
ﬁrst surrogate variable Z1 contains maximum information on the residual
expression heterogeneity compared with the other ones, we consider only
its interactions with the gene and variety effects. The inclusion of these
effects in the model ensures accurate estimation of the actual gene—variety
interactions, capturing the true expression effects of a gene over the two
varieties, if potential hidden variables are embedded in the data structure.
Eijk denotes the random error term corresponding to Y [jk in the model, which
is assumed to follow a N (0, 02) distribution. Here pmax can be speciﬁed by
the user, considering the corresponding situation under study and affording
a reasonable degree of complexity along with a manageable computational
intensity. As for our purpose, we have selected pmax = 3, since from several

empirical studies (details reported in the Supplementary Material) we have
found that the ﬁrst three surrogate variables (Z 1 , Z2, Z 3) explain a substantial
proportion of the dispersion for the variable E. Thus, overall we consider
three different linear models from which the best is selected by the Akaike’s
Information Criterion (AIC) (Hirotsugu, 1974, 1980) and is then used to test
for the equality of gene—variety interaction effects for identifying the truly
differentially expressed genes. In the concerned multiple testing problem,
we use the Benjamini—Hochberg method (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995)
to control the false discovery rate. The entire algorithm for our method
SVA—PLS is presented below:

0 Step I : ﬁt the standard ANOVA model (1) to the log—transformed gene
expression data Y and calculate the ﬁtted residual matrix E.

0 Step 2: regress E on Y by PLS and extract pmax (user—speciﬁed) linear
combinations (scores) from their respective latent factor spaces.

0 Step 3: incorporate, one by one, the pmax scores in the surrogate
variables along with the gene and variety interactions of the ﬁrst PLS
score in model (1) to develop a series of pmax new linear models (4).

0 Step 4: compare AIC’s for the models to select the best out of
them (the model corresponding to the minimum AIC) and denote
its corresponding number of surrogate variables by popt.

0 Step 5: ﬁt model M1,,Opt to estimate the actual gene—variety interaction
effect (GV),-j for each gene i and variety j (i=1,2,m, g and
j=l,2). For each gene i, test the null hypothesis of no variety—

Step 6: perform a multiple testing with these P—values for identifying
the truly differentially expressed genes at a prespeciﬁed level of the
false discovery rate (FDR), using the Benjamini—Hochberg method
(Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3 SIMULATION STUDIES

We envisage a gene expression proﬁling study with 500 genes and 20
subjects, distributed equally over 2 varieties. The entire simulation
study is broadly divided into two settings: (i) assuming the genes
to be independent of each other (Independent) and (ii) assuming
dependence within different groups of genes (Clustered).

The log—transformed gene expression values (Y) are generated by
using a linear model with the gene (G) and variety/tissue type (V)
main effects, their interaction (GV) and a hidden variable (W). Thus,
Y W, corresponding to the i—th gene, j—th variety and k—th subject, is
obtained as:

Yijk=M+Gi+W+(GV)tj+)/Wyk+€yk, (6)

where i = 1,2, ...,500 denote the 500 genes, j = 1,2 denote the two
varieties and k EAj, denote the 20 subjects in the study. Here A1 =
{1, 2, . . . 10} and A2 = {11, 12, . . . , 20} denote, respectively, the subsets
of individuals corresponding to the two varieties 1 and 2. The error
terms eijk s are assumed to be independently distributed as N (0, 02),

where choice of 02 is described next.

Let X denote the design matrix corresponding to the above linear
model, ,8 denote the corresponding vector of regression coefﬁcients
and 6 denote the vector of the corresponding random error terms.
Then we have Y =X,8—I—6. Deﬁne the noise to signal ratio (77)
as 77 :02 /,8T Var(X),B [a2 being the random error variance and
,BT Var(X),B being the variance of the signal X ,8 generating the actual
gene expression levels]. This quantity measures the relative intensity
of the noise coming from the random error and the confounded
primary variable signal depicting the expression effect of the genes
over the two varieties. We consider three different values 01,05
and 1 for 77 to incorporate, respectively, the cases of strong, moderate
and weak primary signal intensity. From these choices of the 77, we
compute the corresponding values of 02 and use them to simulate
the values of eljk s in the model (6).

For data generation, we assume the effects of all terms except the
gene—variety interaction (GV) and the hidden confounder (W) to be
zero. Overall we consider the ﬁrst 70 genes to be truly differentially
expressed among all the 500 genes. For 1 5 i 5 20, we take (GV),'1 =
—7.5, (GV),'2 27.5, for 21 5 i 5 70 (GV),-1 =7.5, (GV)72 = —7.5 and
for genes 71—500 we assume (GV),'1 = (GV),-2 :0.

For each gene i in 1—500, j = 1,2 and subject k EAj, we generate
a Bernoulli random variable silk with success probability of 0.4. It is
used to generate effects of W over the two varieties, under both the
independent as well as clustered settings. Biologically, this accounts
for hidden confounding effects from certain speciﬁc subjects under
each of the two varieties, which is typically expected in a real—
life gene expression analysis. In addition, we consider two separate
scenarios, depending on whether the effect of the hidden variable W
is same or different over the two varieties.

3.1 Independent tests

In this setting, we consider the genes to be independent of one
another. We generate their log—transformed expression levels under
two scenarios of similar and varying effects of the hidden variable
over the two varieties.

The similarity in the effects of the missing variable over the two
varieties is accomplished by simulating the latent variable Wijk from
the same normal distribution for k 6A1 UA2 (covering subjects from
both the varieties). This represents a case when the hidden variable
W is orthogonal to the variety effect. The effect of W is varied over
three different groups of genes by changing the mean parameter
of its distribution. That is, we let lek =lek1(s,-jk = 1), where lek is
generated from N(—3, 0.01) or N(2, 0.01) or N(10, 0.01), depending
on whether 15i520, 215i570 or i>70.

For generating different effects of the hidden variable over the two
varieties, we simulate the latent variable Wijk for the subjects k 6A1
and k 6 A2, from two normal distributions with different means. This
represents a case when the hidden variable W is confounded with the
variety effect. Once again, the effect of the hidden variable is varied
over the three gene groups. That is, we let lek =lek1(s,-jk :1),
where for k 6A1, Zilk is generated from N(—3,0.01) or N(2,0.01)
or N(10,0.01) and for kEAz, ZiZk is generated from N(3,0.01) or
N(15,0.01) or N(20,0.01), depending on whether 15i520, 215
i 5 70 or i > 70.

Next, we consider yet another simulation setting, where the
hidden variable results in a complex confounding pattern with
the varieties. In this case, for variety 1, we simulate the latent
variable Wilk for the subjects k=1,2,...5 and k=6,7, ...10, from

two normal distributions with different means. Analogously, for
variety 2, we simulate the latent variable W727C for the subjects
k=11,12,...15 and 16,17,...20, from two normal distributions
with different means. Similar to the previous settings, we vary the
effect of W over the three gene groups. Thus, under the variety
1, we let WilkZZilkHSiIkZI), where for k=l,2,...5, Zilk IS
generated from N(—3,0.01) or N(2,0.01) or N(10,0.01) and for
k=6,7,...10, Zilk is generated from N(3,0.01) or N(15,0.01) or
N(20,0.01), depending on whether 15i520, 215i570 or i>70.
Similarly, under variety 2, we let W727C =Zi2k1(Si2k :1), where for
k=11,12,...15, ZiZk is generated from N(—6,0.01) or N(2,0.01)
or N(10,0.01) and for k=16,17,...20, ZiZk is generated from
N(5,0.01) or N(15,0.01) or N(15,0.01), depending on whether
15i520, 215i570 ori>70.

3.2 Cluster-dependent tests

Note that the usual statistical model for differential gene analysis by
the ANOVA formulation assumes independent error terms. However,
it is well known that in reality, certain groups of genes have
correlated expressions. In this setting, we consider three clusters
of correlated genes with the same gene—variety interaction effects
as for the case of independently expressed genes, with the hidden
variable (W) being generated according to the same set of simulation
schemes as in Section 3.1.

The underlying dependence among the genes is incorporated by
generating the random error term eijk in model (6) as a weighted sum

of two different errors 61 and 62, simulated independently of each
other, with the values of 61 being same for all the genes in the same
cluster. Let C=(1,2, ...,20;51,52,...,70;461,462, ...,500) denote
the union of the three clusters. Then, mathematically the generation
of eljk in the simulation model (6) is expressed as:

1
EW“;E§®mk+Vqﬁmk#l€C’ (D

zeakyt¢c, (&

where, I (i) denotes the cluster containing gene i. The random
error terms 6}(i)’j’k and 631316 are generated from independent
N (0,02) distributions (02 being determined from the desired noise
to signal ratio, as before). From a biological perspective, this
simulation setting captures the idea that genes in the same cluster
act cooperatively, resulting in correlated expression measurements.

The simulation study is concerned with a performance analysis
of standard ANOVA, our method SVA—PLS and SVA (downloaded
from www.bioconductor.org on November 29, 2011) with respect to
four measures: sensitivity, speciﬁcity, FDR and false non—discovery
rate (FNR).

(1) Sensitivity: proportion among differentially expressed genes
that were declared signiﬁcant.

(2) Speciﬁcity: proportion among non—differentially expressed
genes that were declared non—signiﬁcant.

(3) FDR: proportion among genes declared signiﬁcant that were
not differentially expressed.

(4) FNR: proportion among genes declared non—signiﬁcant that
were differentially expressed.

The entire simulation study is performed 100 times under
each scenario in order to compute the average values of the
four performance measures. Under the clustered setting, the SVA
software broke down at several iterations of the simulation study.
Hence, for this setting we only report the performance of our method
(SVA—PLS) and the standard ANOVA.

From the performance analysis of the three methods on the
independent gene expression levels, with similar, varying and
complex effects of the hidden variable (Tables 1, 2 and 3,
respectively), we see that SVA—PLS achieves the highest sensitivity
compared with standard AN OVA and SVA. Interestingly, the margin
of sensitivity for our method is very high in the case of complex
confounding (Table 3), followed by the case of varying effects of
the hidden variable over the tissue types (Table 2). This observation
demonstrates that our method is most useful for the relatively
complicated situations, when the missing variable is in fact a
statistical confounder affecting the primary variable signals from the
two tissue types. In addition, our method produces a comparatively
impressive performance with respect to the other two methods in

terms of the high speciﬁcity and reasonably small FDR and FNR.
Under the clustered setting with dependence inside several clusters
of genes (Tables 4, 5 and 6 for the moderate case of 77 = 0.5),
SVA—PLS performs really well compared with standard ANOVA by
detecting a larger number of truly positive genes with its high margin
of sensitivity, at the cost of a slightly increased FDR, which is an
obvious price to pay for achieving a higher performance in terms of
detection power. For the other choices of the 77 too, SVA—PLS shows
higher sensitivity compared with standard ANOVA (we refer to the
Supplementary Material). Under this setting also, our method yields
a reasonably high speciﬁcity in comparison to standard ANOVA
along with an impressively small FDR and FNR. Speciﬁcally, the
margin of sensitivity for SVA—PLS under both the simulation settings
is the highest in the best case with very strong primary variable signal
(77 = 0.1), closely followed by the moderate (77 = 0.5) and worst cases
(77:1). Thus, overall the results demonstrate that our method, by

virtue of its high sensitivity in a wide variety of situations can
potentially discover many truly differentially expressed genes that
are masked by the effects of hidden factors and can simultaneously
maintain acceptably small error rates.

We further illustrate the efﬁcacy of our method by comparing the
actual (mean centered) values of the hidden variable Wijk (simulated
in the model under the setting of independently expressed genes
with serious confounding of the hidden variable W), with the PLS—

imputed values ngp , incorporated in the ANCOVA model (4).
We observe a strongly linear relationship between the two sets of
values with a very high positive correlation (0.95) (Fig. 1). We have
noticed a similar effect in the other simulation settings as well. This
demonstrates that our method SVA—PLS is effectively imputing the

hidden variable (W) on the actual expression levels of the genes.

4 ANALYSIS OF LEUKEMIA DATA

We now explore the performance of our method on a dataset
generated from a gene expression study of AMKL, which is a
subtype of the disease acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The dataset
was featured in Bourquin et al. (2006). It contains the expression
levels of 22283 genes on two types of AMKL patients, 23 with
down—syndrome and 38 without down—syndrome.

In general, down syndrome patients are more prone to AMKL
compared those without it and treatment outcomes are also much
more favorable for them. From an exploratory analysis of the dataset
(B ourquin et al., 2006), it was found that the non—DS AMKL patients
can be further subdivided into two groups using the expression
proﬁles of the HOX/TALE family members. This latent grouping
inside one tissue type can generate hidden confounders, which may
in turn perturb the actual signals of variety—speciﬁc differential gene
expression. Thus, it is important to search for the traces of residual
gene expression heterogeneity in this dataset for ensuring a more
accurate inference on the truly positive genes, which is built into our
method. Indeed, we investigated whether the PLS—imputed values
Wimp of the three genes, HOXAQ, HOXAIO and MEISI, belonging
to the HOX/TALE family, contain a subgroup signature. Figure 2
shows a heat map for the normalized values of the estimated PLS
contributed part Wimp, corresponding to the 38 individuals in the
non—DS AMKL group. This Wimp is free from the primary signal of
variety—speciﬁc differential expression and is expected to contain
the traces of residual expression heterogeneity corresponding to
the hidden factors in the data. From Figure 2, we can observe a
subgroup structure among these individuals. Clearly, the differential
pattern is strongest for the MEIS] gene, followed by HOXAQ and
HOXAIO.

The three methods SVA—PLS, standard ANOVA and SVA were
applied to the log—transformed expression matrix of the 22 283 genes
in the dataset. Overall, SVA—PLS detected 1585 genes followed by
1407 genes from standard AN OVA and 280 genes from SVA (Fig. 3).
Our method detects a total of 427 genes, that are missed by others,
of which at least six genes deserve special mention. These genes are
MLFI, BRCA2, TNF, c-MPL, CD44 and MAGE—D4.

The gene MLF] is actively involved in the development of AML.
A chromosomal derangement associated with this gene is a cause of
the myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) (Block et al., 1953). Patients
with this syndrome often develop acute anemia, which in most
cases lead to low blood counts. In almost one—third of the patients,
this syndrome causes progressive bone marrow failure, which in
turn develops the disease into AML. Also, delayed bone marrow
transplantation for patients with low risk of the MDS has been
found to be connected with the improved outcome (Cutler et al.,
2004).

The gene BRCA2 is an important caretaker gene (Kinzler and
Vogelstein, 1997), whose inactivation initiates a tumor and the
resulting genetic instability causes accelerated mutation in all
genes, which in turn, may lead to the rapid progression of the
tumor. Germline mutations in this gene play a dominant role
in the onset of breast and ovarian cancer, pancreatic cancer,
prostate cancer, Fanconi anemia and pre—B—cell acute lymphoblastic
leukemia (Lancaster et al., 1996, Murphy et al., 2002, Narod et al.,
2008, Ozcelik et al., 1997, Wagner et al., 2004).

The apoptosis—inducing ligand TRAIL related to the gene TNF,
plays an active role in the development of different types of
cancers. Downregulation of TRAIL-R2 inhibits the TRAIL—mediated
apoptosis in AML (Riccioni et al., 2005). Monoallelic deletion of the
tumor—suppressing genes TRAIL-R] and TRAIL-R2 can inactivate the
TRAIL—induced apoptosis in B—cell lymphoma (Rubio—Moscardo
et al., 2005). In the development of colorectal cancer, there is a
substantial increase in sensitivity to TRAIL—induced apoptosis, with
the progression from benign to malignant tumors (Haque et al.,
2005).

Expression of the gene c-MPL has been found to be involved in
the progression of CD34+ and M2FAB subtypes of AML (Ayala
et al., 2009).

Ligation of the gene CD44 with speciﬁc anti-CD44 antibodies
(or with its natural ligand hyaluronan) can reverse the blockage
in the differentiation of several subtypes of AML, thereby
improving the survival of patients using differentiating agents
(e.g. retinoic acid) (Charrad et al., 1999). The 8:21 chromosomal
translocation is commonly observed in AML. Acute myeloid
leukemia—1 transcription factor AMLl-ETO and its splice variant
AMLl-ETO9a are capable of modulating the expression of CD44,
thereby connecting the abnormal translocation 8:21 to the regulation
of a cell adhesion molecule, that is involved in the nurturing
of AML blast/stem cells (Peterson et al., 2007). In the acute
promyelocytic leukemia cell line NB4, overexpression of the
gene CD44 receptor results in apoptosis (Abecassis et al., 2008).
In addition, downregulation of this gene has been found to
be conducive to keratoacanthoma and squamous cell carcinoma
(Tataroglu et al., 2007).

Upregulation of the gene MAGE—D4 results in the proliferation
of tumor cells in non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) (Ito et al.,
2006).

Thus, we ﬁnd that a number of the additional genes selected by
our method are connected to AML or some other related type of
carcinoma. These genes being found to be differentially expressed
between the subjects with and without down syndrome, can serve as
important candidates for research on leukemia and down syndrome.

5 DISCUSSION

Hidden array-speciﬁc (subject-speciﬁc) factors in microarray
analyses may constitute a substantial source of gene expression
heterogeneity. The effects of these factors are not detectable from
outside and also cannot be removed by any standard normalizing
method. But they can perturb the primary signals of differential
gene expression and lead to erroneous conclusions on the detection
of differentially expressed genes.

This problem is relatively unexplored in gene expression studies.
In this article, we have developed a novel technique for identifying
these latent factors by using PLS and applied it to a wide variety of
simulation settings characterizing different patterns of viable gene
expression proﬁling studies. We have shown that the technique of
PLS, by virtue of its basic principle of projecting to latent structures,
can produce precise estimates of the hidden factors causing the
spurious signal heterogeneity. These estimates (surrogate variables)
when incorporated in the ANOVA model enhances detection of the
gene—variety interaction effects thereby leading to a large gain in
sensitivity of the underlying bioinformatics screening procedure.
The resulting method, SVA-PLS, also yields a reasonably high
speciﬁcity for a wide range of data structures, thereby ensuring
an efﬁcient control over the incorrect detection of many silent
genes. The FDR is marginally higher for our method, but is
sufﬁciently well compensated by a substantially large gain in the
margin of sensitivity. Overall, SVA-PLS emerges as the winner when
compared with two other competing methods in a range of controlled
settings. The utility of our method in detecting potentially interesting
genes missed by other methods is also demonstrated by an analysis
of a real dataset on AMKL patients.

Unaccounted sources of variation (hidden variables) in a model
can adversely affect the outcomes of statistical tests. This is
particularly true if the unmeasured variables are confounders, i.e.
correlated with the variables in the model whose effects on the
outcomes are being tested. In a simple two group comparison, a
standard assumption for the validity of the commonly used two
sample pooled t-test is that the error variances in the two groups
(populations) are equal. A departure from this model assumption
is known as the Behrens—Fisher problem and has received a great
deal of assumption in the statistics literature [see e.g. Lehmann
(1986)]. A common solution to this problem is to use separate
variance estimates for the error distribution in two groups and resort
either to an approximate t-distribution (Welch, 1938) or to a large
sample normal approximation of the distribution of the test statistics.
Indeed, if one assumes (as in our formulation) the existence of an
unmeasured factor contributing to the outcome in a linear model
formulation of the two sample problem that is equated with the
model errors, one gets a model with unequal variances in the two
groups. Thus, our method may provide an alternative solution to

the Behrens—Fisher problem. We plan to explore this connection in
greater details elsewhere.

ABSTRACT

Motivation: Titration experiments measuring the gene expression
from two different tissues, along with total RNA mixtures of the pure
samples, are frequently used for quality evaluation of microarray
technologies. Such a design implies that the true mRNA expression
of each gene, is either constant or follows a monotonic trend
between the mixtures, applying itself to the use of order restricted
inference procedures. Exploiting only the postulated monotonicity of
titration designs, we propose three statistical analysis methods for
the validation of high-throughput genetic data and corresponding
preprocessing techniques.

Results: Our methods allow for inference of accuracy, repeatability
and cross-platform agreement, with minimal required assumptions
regarding the underlying data generating process. Therefore, they
are readily applicable to all sorts of genetic high-throughput data
independent of the degree of preprocessing. An application to the
EMERALD dataset was used to demonstrate how our methods
provide a rich spectrum of easily interpretable quality metrics
and allow the comparison of different microarray technologies and
normalization methods. The results are on par with previous work,
but provide additional new insights that cast doubt on the utility
of popular preprocessing techniques, specifically concerning the
EMERALD projects dataset.

that measure the gene expression in two different tissues, along
with total RNA mixtures of the pure samples, have been shown to
provide a valuable tool for the evaluation of quality related aspects
of microarray data (Holloway et al., 2006; The MAQC Consortium,
2006). Such experiments operate on the assumption that for any
fragment the abundance in the mixed samples can be determined
as a function of their expression in the pure samples and the given
mixture proportions (See Fig. l for a schematic depiction of this
concept).

In contrast to spike—in studies where a set of mRNA fragments
are added at predetermined concentrations to some of the samples,
titration series are not based on synthetic RNA fragments [see e. g.
Irizarry et al. (2006) responding to Choe et al. (2005)]. Titration
series provide measurements from authentic biological samples
that reﬂect the intricate characteristics of RNA samples. Their
disadvantage is that they do not provide a gold standard (i.e. the
set of true differentially expressed genes is unknown). The only
knowledge available a priori in titration experiments is given
by the mixture proportions and the thereby deﬁned relationship
between mRNA amounts throughout the titration series. Solely
this relationship can be investigated, tested and compared on
measurements acquired from several combinations of microarray
platforms and preprocessing methods and is the basis for quality
assessment. Holloway et al. (2006), for example, assume that
the measured abundances follow a linear trend throughout the
titration series. Shippy et al. (2006), however, observe ‘signal
compression and expansion’, which would comprise a violation to
such assumptions. Similarly, in microarray dose—response studies,
Hu et al. (2005) report that linear model—based inference procedures
fail to identify monotonic effects with non—linear response curves,
therefore methods allowing for more general monotonic trends are
more efﬁcient.

In this article, we propose statistical analysis methods to assess
the accuracy, repeatability and agreement across different platforms
for high—throughput genetic data. Our methods are based solely on
the postulated monotonicity of titration designs, but do not rely on
assumptions about the functional form of this trend. They are able
to deal with grouping factors (e.g. repeated measurements, batch
factors) that induce a hierarchical variance structure. Using these
methods, we compare several combinations of microarray platforms
and preprocessing strategies. In Section 2, we present our methods
along the lines of a large—scale titration experiment [parts of which
have been previously used in (Scherer, 2009, chapter 9)] published
by the EMERALD project that is described in Section 2.1. The
methods, however, are applicable to titration designs in general,
where one obvious candidate is the MAQC experiment presented
in Shippy et al. (2006). Having a similar variance structure with
one random effect ‘site’ allows the proposed methods to be directly
applied.

In our analysis, we use the data structure induced by the titration
design in several ways. Initially, we investigate if the postulated
order structure is present in the data, estimate and test for deviations
of the observed expression values from monotonicity. This part of
the analysis can be considered as an assessment of accuracy, deﬁned
as the agreement between the result of a measurement and the value
of the measurand (Taylor and Kuyatt, 1994). To assess to which
degree the obtained measurements conform to the monotonicity
requirement, we test consecutive differences between mixture
groups for a signiﬁcant increase or decrease in expression, separately
for each gene. We construct permutation tests accounting for the
speciﬁc hierarchical variance structure of the EMERALD dataset
adjusting for multiple testing using a recently proposed procedure
(Guo et al., 2009), which accounts for directional errors. Thereby
we can identify any signiﬁcant deviation from the monotonicity
assumption which is in violation of the intrinsic implications of the
study design. More details on the approach are given in Section 2.3
and the results are presented in Section 3.1.

Further, order restricted methods allow us to improve estimates
of variance components. These can be used to quantify the
repeatability [i.e. the extent to which successive measurements
of the same measurand carried out under identical conditions of
measuring agree (Taylor and Kuyatt, 1994)]. Decomposition of the
total variance allows us to identify noise that can be attributed
to either procedural variation (e. g. imperfections in the wet lab
procedures) or biological variation (i.e. the variability between
different biological samples). Further, being corrected for structural
variance components, the residual variance provides an estimate of
the technical repeatability. In Section 2.4, we propose a novel method
to estimate such variance components under order restrictions. In
Appendix C in Supplementary Material, we report a simulation study
that demonstrates the improvement due to the new method compared
with estimators not exploiting order restrictions. The application to
the dataset is discussed in Section 3.2.

Finally, we raise the topic of cross—platform agreement in
terms of the correspondence of differential expression analysis
between the measurement technologies. Differential expression
between the two different organ materials introduces (based on
the monotonicity assumption) a monotonous trend throughout the
titration series. We therefore derive an inference procedure to
test the null hypothesis of non—differential expression for each
gene from a well annotated set of common genes, found on

each platform. The test was based on isotonic regression and
permutation—based multiple testing methods. The corresponding
methods are described in Section 2.5 with results shown in
Section 3.3.

Section 4 concludes the article with a discussion of our methods
and results.

2 METHODS

2.1 Microarrays and preprocessing

The probe material used in the EMERALD experiment was harvested from
six rats, where total RNA was extracted from livers and kidneys. The resulting
sample material was then prepared in four mixtures:

(1) pure liver material, which we will refer to as L;

(2) 75% liver mixed with 25% kidney material, which we will call M l;
(3) 25% liver and 75% kidney, in the following simply M2; and

(4) pure kidney material, which is denoted as K.

This yielded four times six batches of sample material. Each batch
was labeled and hybridized to three arrays from each of three different
commercially available microarray platforms. The microarray platforms used
in the EMERALD project were as follows:

0 Affymetrix GeneChip Rat Genome 230 2.0;
0 Illumina RatRef—l2 vl Expression BeadChip; and
0 Agilent Whole Rat Genome Microarray 4x44K.

In summary, this amounts to:
3 platforms x 6 rats x 4 mixtures x 3 replicates = 216 arrays.

The ArrayExpress accession page of the Illumina dataset states concerns
about the quality of several arrays from this experiment. Following these
suggestions and careful quality control, we removed six arrays from this
dataset. Furthermore, we removed one array from the Affymetrix dataset due
to quality concerns. For details, see Appendix A in Supplementary Material.

The sensitivity of the genetic material to slight aberrations in the wet lab
procedure makes microarray measurements vulnerable to the introduction
of systematic biases. Therefore, microarray measurements are typically
subjected to extensive data preprocessing. Besides several platform—speciﬁc
procedures like background correction, normalization plays an inﬂuential
role during this preanalysis step. In order to see, if and how, such
methods effect the quality criteria investigated in this work, the EMERALD
data were subjected to two different normalization procedures [Baseline
normalization (median scaling) and Quantile normalization]. This results
in two additional versions of the dataset, besides the unpreprocessed
data, providing insight on the effectiveness of such algorithms. For
Baseline normalization, the per chip median was subtracted from the
corresponding log expression values and subsequently the overall median
(across all expressions measured with a particular platform) was added.
Quantile normalization was performed according to the algorithm deﬁned
in Gentleman et al. (2005, chapter 1). Data were downloaded from
ArrayExpress and processed using R (R Development Core Team, 2008) and
Bioconductor (Gentleman et al., 2004). Recent annotation ﬁles were acquired
from the respective manufacturer web sites (http://www.affymetrix.com/,
http://www.agilent.com/, http://www.illumina.com/) (see Appendix B in
Supplementary Material for details). In contrast to Agilent and Illumina,
which provide one probe reading per reporter, Affymetrix features several
probe readings per reporter. To summarize the corresponding measurements,
we used the robust multiarray average (RMA) (Irizarry et al., 2003) either
directly on the raw data or after normalization was applied. Normalization
was performed based on the expressions of all reporters provided by each
particular platform. Expression values from all platforms and normalization
procedures were analyzed on the logz scale.

Cross-platform comparison

 

To select a common set of proﬁciently annotated probes that were featured
on each of the investigated platforms, probes were mapped to RefSeq (Pruitt
et al., 2006) NM identiﬁers (see Appendix B in Supplementary Material).
This identiﬁed a set of 5927 transcripts for which a probe was provided by all
platforms. All downstream analysis after normalization and summarization
(in the case of Affymetrix) were done based on this set of common reporters.

2.2 Notation and model deﬁnition

To keep notation short, we will refer to the three platforms with the shortened
names Affy, Agil and Illu. Expression values are typically denoted by y using
the following indices:

ge{l,...,G}  probes
ie{L,Ml,M2,K} 
je{l,...,6} 
ke{l,...,3} 

mixture groups
animals
technical replicates.

Note that in our terminology expression value refers to preprocessed
measurement values (i.e. log—transformed, normalized). Thus, ygl‘jk denotes
a preprocessed expression value for probe g, group i, animal j and replicate
k. Separate models are assumed for different platforms and normalization
procedures. Corresponding indices, however, were omitted in the deﬁnition.
Overlined variables indicate averages, calculated using the arithmetic mean.
The relevant margins are indicated by the indices, which are replaced by dots.
For example, yg,” stands for the average expression of probe g in mixture
group i for all replicates and animals.

Besides the noise generated by the imprecision of the measurement
technology, there is variation due to the use of animals with genetic
differences. This variance structure generated by the experimental design
can be directly translated into a mixed model deﬁnition, assumed for each
probe separately.

Ygijk =Mg+06gi+ﬁgj+ygzj+€gzjk (1)
with the assumptions:
Mg, 05g,- ﬁxed effect
ﬁg,- ~ N(0,oﬂ)
Vgij N N (0W)
Egz‘jk N N(0,06)

The levels of the ﬁxed effect 05g,- are comprised by the four different
mixture groups. Biological variation between different rats was modeled
by the random effect ﬁgj. Since material coming from different rats was
processed and mixed separately, we also included the random interaction
term ygl-j.

To incorporate the assumption of monotonicity of the titration response,
the effects 05g,- including the special case of constant expression are required
to either follow an up— or downward trend, i.e.

OlgL S 05ng S OlgMZ S Ong 0r: 

OlgL 205ng ngM2 ngK, (3)

2.3 Accuracy

Information on the true amounts of mRNA fragments in the sample
quantifying the accuracy of the measurements is lacking. We are, therefore,
limited to an investigation of the probe amount not showing a monotonous
titration response. The EMERALD experiment provides three comparisons
between adjacent mixture groups: L —M l, M l —M 2 and K —M 2. Each can
be positive, zero or negative, generating 27 possibilities for the expressions
to change throughout the titration series. Only 14 of these possible trends
are monotonous including the special case of unchanged expression. We,
therefore, employ a test for the direction of change between consecutive

mixture groups describing the shape of expression changes for each gene,
platform and normalization method.

For each gene g the linear contrasts (i.e. L—Ml, M l—M2, K —M2)
are estimated using t—statistics. P—values of the marginal null hypotheses
were computed by random permutation of samples within the animals
(i.e. leaving the variance structure intact). Under the null hypothesis, we
assume exchangeability of the samples within each animal regardless of
titration group i. Hence, the data conditional univariate null distribution for
each gene g can be computed by permuting samples of the two particular
mixture groups but only within each block of the individual random effect
(6]) (Pesarin, 2001). Multiplicity correction was performed as described in
Guo et al. (2009). This algorithm provides control of the mixed directional
false discovery rate, which is deﬁned as the sum of the expected proportion of
erroneous rejections and the expected proportion of directional errors among
all rejections.

2.4 Repeatability

The model speciﬁed in (l) naturally lends itself to an analysis of repeatability
as a measure of the variation observed in repeated measurements. Our
primary target in this investigation was the residual error as deﬁned by 06.
The two random effects ﬁg,- and ygl-j comprise noise contributed either by
actual differences in the gene expression between animals or procedural
inconsistencies in the preparation of the mRNA samples. Neither of which
can be solely attributed to the measurement quality provided by the used
platform. It is, therefore, necessary to decompose the variance observed in
the data to provide an estimate of the relevant variance term 06.

The order restrictions (2,3) on the levels of the ﬁxed effect 05,- can be
exploited to enable an improved estimate for the means of expression levels
in each mixture group. Isotonic regression provides such estimates. For a
given set of points and prespeciﬁed direction, it ﬁnds the set of ordered points
that is closest to the original in terms of the squared distance (Brunk, 1955).
The corresponding algorithm works by recursively pooling and averaging
adjacent groups of points that violate the speciﬁed order restriction until a
valid ﬁt is found. We denote the isotonic estimates based on a particular
set by 32;?!) or ygflown, where the former indicates the ﬁt to the set of means
ygL”, wig,“ assuming an increasing trend and the latter a decreasing trend.

Sampson et al. (2003) investigated a simpliﬁed isotonic regression
scenario and suggest an improved variance estimate by incorporating
information about the observed order. We extend this idea to the problem
of variance decomposition. The idea is simple: specify the levels of the
ﬁxed effect according to the pooled groups given by isotonic regression
and estimate the variance components using this updated model deﬁnition.
As an example assume that for a particular mRNA fragment we observe
m. < Sign/11” < ngu but Sign/11” > ngzu, an upward trend except for the mean
in group M2 being lower than the mean in M l. Pooling groups M l and
M2, however, will generate the correct order. Therefore, we calculated the
variance components using a standard method, with the levels M l and
M2 merged in the model deﬁnition. The intuition behind this approach, is
that whenever the order restriction is violated for adjacent pairs, one can
assume the means in either group to be equal. The corresponding means can,
therefore, be estimated from a larger sample and degrees of freedom can be
retained by estimating this mean only once.

The experimental design in the EMERALD dataset is balanced, however,
removing arrays from the analysis, due to quality concerns, or merging
levels in the ﬁxed effect introduces imbalance to the model matrix. Classical
ANOVA methods cannot be applied in such circumstances, but iterative
methods like Restricted Maximum Likelihood (REML) can deal with such
situations (Searle et al., 1992). We also consider Henderson’s method 111
(Searle et 01., 1992) which is a modiﬁed ANOVA method not requiring
the design to be balanced. It provides closed solutions for estimates of the
variance components and hence promises improved computation times.

Our simulations (see Appendix C in Supplementary Material ) show that
restricted estimation of variance components using information from isotonic
regression is indeed preferable to unrestricted methods. In scenarios where

there is no or only a slight trend throughout the titration series, this approach
yields a lower mean squared error (MSE) in estimates of the interaction term
0),, while introducing only negligible bias. Our simulations show that in
terms of Bias and MSE the implementation using Henderson’s procedure is
less efﬁcient than the alternative procedure based on REML as implemented
by the nlme package (Pinheiro and Bates, 2000) in GNU R (R Development
Core Team, 2008). Computation times for Henderson’s procedure, however,
were shorter by approximately a factor of 100. For the analysis in Section 3.2,
we used the REML—based method for its improved efﬁciency. In situations
where the number of investigated probes is even larger (e. g. next generation
sequencing experiments), one might compromise some efﬁciency in favor for
a marked speed improvement and use the procedure based on Henderson’s
method.

2.5 Agreement

In this section, we investigate to which degree the different platforms and
normalization methods detect the same genes as differentially expressed.
Thus, we test for each gene if there is a monotone trend in the expression
levels throughout the titrations. Instead of pair wise comparisons of adjacent
titration levels, we use a more powerful overall test for a monotonic trend
for each gene, based on a test statistic proposed by Barlow (1972), to test the
null hypothesis of equal means against an order restricted alternative. Based
on (1), (2) and (3), we test the null hypothesis of equal means in the ﬁxed
effects at

H0,g:OlgL=Olng =05gM2=Onga 

against the two ordered alternatives

up .
Hlag. OlgLSOlng SngziagK, (5)

with at least one strict inequality. The test statistic is given by:

*up 2
EM, _ Zgijk(ygijk_ygi ) (7)
g — ——2
Zgz’jk(ygijk -ygt..)

d 2
 _  (8)
g Zgijk(ygijk ‘7gi..)2

E; = min{E§“P,Eg2d0W"}, (9)

The Egzup statistic for gene g is the ratio of the residual sum of squares of
the isotonic regression ﬁt, assuming an upward trend, against the residual
sum of squares of the null model of equal means. Similarly, the E?“
is calculated accordingly using isotonic regression assuming a downward
trend. The directional decision is then made by choosing the smaller of
the two statistics. Egz, therefore, gives a two—sided test statistic. Lin et al.
(2007) assess a permutation version of this test in the context of genetic data
and ﬁnd that it is the most powerful among a selection of alternative test
statistics. Approximation of the marginal null distribution of test statistics
was accomplished by randomly permuting samples within each animal to
account for the hierarchical structure in the data. Permutation is performed as
described in Section 2.3 with the difference that samples from all four mixture
groups are permuted. To adjust for multiple testing controlling the family
wise error rate (FWE), we use a resampling—based approach by Westfall and
Young (1993). Permuting samples in parallel for all genes, the multivariate
distribution of the vector of test statistics (E2,  E;  Eg) under the global
null hypothesis can be computed. We used the single—step maxT procedure,
which controls the FWE in the strong sense [under the assumption of subset
pivotality, see (Westfall and Young, 1993)] and also safeguards against
potential errors in term of the directional decision. Alternatively, one can
use the residual to total sum of squares ratio from a linear model instead of
E2. This amounts to a test of the null hypothesis against a linear trend. We
detail such an approach in Appendix F in Supplementary Material.

These permutation tests are applied separately to the data from each
combination of platform and normalization method. For each platform and

normalization, we control the FWE at a two—sided level of at = 5%. Then for
each pair of platforms or normalizations we computed the speciﬁc agreement
(Cicchetti and Feinstein, 1990) of the resulting lists of genes with signiﬁcant
upward or downward trends. This measure of overlap is deﬁned by the
number of rejected hypotheses with the same directional decision, with both
platforms or normalizations, divided by the number of hypotheses rejected
on average (in that direction) with these platforms or normalizations. Genes,
having a signiﬁcant upward trend in one analysis but a signiﬁcant downward
trend in another, were called discordant. For these, the shown percentages
are computed as the proportion of discordant genes within all genes that
show a signiﬁcant trend on at least one platform or normalization.

Note that under the assumption that for all platforms the same null
hypotheses are tested, speciﬁc agreement is just a function of the statistical
power of the procedures. Therefore, it depends not only on the platform and
pre—processing method but also on the sample size, the statistical tests and
multiplicity correction used, as well as the underlying pattern of differentially
expressed genes. However, lack of overlap may also be due to systematic
biases of the considered platforms or analysis methods. A strong indicator
for the presence of bias is the number of discordant test decisions. Since the
FWE rate is controlled at level at and the test results across platforms and
normalization methods can be expected to be positively correlated (since they
are based on the same data or biological material), the probability to observe
discordant test decisions in a speciﬁc pairwise comparison of platforms or
normalization methods is lower than 052.

3 RESULTS

Exploratory investigation of the raw data has uncovered a distinct
overall trend of expression values. Figure 2 shows that the non—
normalized signals are on average larger in kidney than in liver
samples. Typically, the proportion of fragments that change between
conditions is expected to be small enough so that the per sample
distributions of expression values are similar. This assumption is, as
an example, explicitly used in several quality assessment procedures
and deviations are considered as an indication for quality issues
(Gentleman et al., 2005, chapter 3).

A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that differences in
the total to messenger RNA proportions generate such an overall
trend. While equal amounts of total RNA were used for each
array, the observed signals reﬂect only the fraction constituted by

messenger RNA. A higher concentration of detectable mRNA in
the kidney samples would lead to overall stronger signals on arrays
hybridized with this material. Since estimates (Shippy et al., 2006)
of these quantities from the data are too variable to conclusively
identify an imbalance in mRNA proportions as a cause of this
phenomenon, further measurements would be needed. Shippy et al.
(2006) describe a method for measuring these proportions. For
Affymetrix, Hannah et al. (2008) propose a method to normalize
such global mRNA shifts using a set of external RNA spike—ins.

We estimated that the normalization parameters based on the
entirety of probes featured on a particular platform, however,
restrict our analysis to the set of well—annotated probes common
to all three technologies as deﬁned in Section 2.1. Considering all
measurements from a speciﬁc platform, the chip—wise medians of
baseline and all chip—wise quantiles of quantile normalized data,
respectively, are by deﬁnition of the respective methods, constant
throughout the titration groups. Columns two and three of Figure 2
show normalized expression values from our set of well—annotated
probes common to all platforms. These display remnants of the
overall expression increase, from liver to kidney, observed in the
raw data. This indicates that the overall trend in raw expressions
is more pronounced for fragments measured by the well—annotated
probes common to all platforms than in the remaining probes.
Further exploration of this ﬁnding (data not shown) revealed a higher
proportion of measurements with very low expressions throughout
all titration groups among the set of probes not included in the
analysis and suggested an increased amount of fragments that are
not expressed. Such measurements, which are solely noise, would
not be affected by unequal total to messenger RNA concentrations in
liver and kidney material and hence not show the otherwise implied
trend.

3.1 Accuracy

Figure 3 presents the results of the shape analysis. Each of the three
consecutive differences (L —M 1, M2 —M l and K —M 2) were tested
using the test described in Section 2.3. Multiplicity correction was
applied to control the mixed directional false discovery rate at the
5% level. In Figure 3, the 27 distinct possibilities of test results
for each reporter were summarized into eight categories. Signiﬁcant
non—monotonous trends (i.e. at least one signiﬁcant increase together
with at least one signiﬁcant decrease), non—signiﬁcant trends (i.e. for
all three differences the null hypotheses of no expression change
could not be rejected) and monotonous trends characterized by
the number of signiﬁcant expression changes. Non—monotonous
trends should not be observed under the premises of a titration
series and are a clear indication of data artifacts. The distribution
of different trend shapes changes strongly between differently
normalized data, a phenomenon that we explain in more detail in
Section 3.3. Furthermore, we observe that normalization, for all
platforms, leads to a larger number of rejections. With the exception
of Agilent, the maximum is reached on quantile normalized data.
Both normalization procedures lead to a slight increase in the
number of observed non—monotonous trends, which are contrary
to the implications of the titration series. Although these ﬁgures
are below the error margin provisioned by the ﬁve percent mixed
directional false discovery rate, such trends are not observed (with
one exception in the Illumina data) on non—normalized data. This
indicates that data artifacts are introduced upon normalization.

Fig. 3. Shape proﬁles: distribution of detected trends for the three platforms
and normalization methods. The last line (11 .mon . ) in each panel gives the
proportion of genes with signiﬁcant non—monotonous trends. The second last
line (ins ig .) shows the proportion of genes for which none of the three
linear contrasts could be rejected. The remaining lines show the proportions
of genes for which one, two or three of the tested contrasts showed a
signiﬁcant difference in a speciﬁc direction, while the remaining comparisons
showed no signiﬁcant changes in expression. Numbers in the margins of each
panel give the absolute numbers of genes in that category.

3.2 Repeatability

Relating to the EMERALD dataset, the variance components deﬁned
in Section 2.2 can be attributed to several sources of variation.
The variation of the individual effect, 0,3, represents variance
introduced by differing levels of mRNA amounts between rats.
The interpretation of the variation in the interaction term, 0),, is
more intricate. Possible sources are inconsistencies in the mixture
proportions, and also biological differences between animals in
the strength of the titration response. The residual variance 06
is the variation introduced by unspeciﬁed factors. We use it as
an estimate of the measurement error inherent to each platform,
also including error introduced by any component not speciﬁed in
the model (e.g. different scanners, ﬂuidics stations, etc.). Figure 4
shows boxplots of estimates for these components computed on
data preprocessed by the two normalization methods as well
as on the unnormalized data. Estimates are shown as percent
proportions of the total variance to provide a scale that is comparable
between different normalization methods. We observe that both
normalization methods manage to reduce the residual variance on all
platforms. However, quantile normalization achieves slightly better
results than baseline normalization. This pattern in residual error
reduction corresponds well with the increased amounts of rejections
achieved on normalized data presented in Figure 3.

3.3 Trend tests and their agreement

We report for each platform and normalization method the
number of genes where the null hypothesis of non—differential
expression throughout titration levels is rejected, and as outlined
in Section 2.5 investigate to which degree the different platforms
and normalization methods detect the same genes as differentially
expressed genes within the same directional decision.

Fig. 5. Percentages and absolute numbers of probes found with a signiﬁcant
upward or downward trend. None, refers to probes for which the null
hypothesis could not be rejected.

Figure 5 shows the observed proportions of signiﬁcant trends.
Regardless of normalization or platform, the proportion of probes
for which the null of constant expression across titration levels
could be rejected (at a two sided FWE level of 5%) in favor
of a monotonous trend is exceptionally high and ranges from
56% to 75%. Because of the higher power of the trend test, this
exceeds the number of rejections achieved by the shape test in
Section 3.1. Regardless of platform, non—normalized data shows
three to ﬁve times more signiﬁcant upward than downward trends.
This is consistent with the overall upward trend of expression
values observed in Figure 2. After normalization with either method
(baseline or quantile normalization), the number of signiﬁcant
upward and downward trends became more balanced.

Figure 6 summarizes the absolute numbers of concordant test
decisions as well as percent overlap (as deﬁned in Section 2.5) in all
pair wise comparisons of different platforms for each normalization
method. We observe that the speciﬁc agreement across platforms
for genes with signiﬁcant upward trends ranges (depending on
the platforms and normalization methods) from 79% to 85%.
In contrast, the speciﬁc agreement for downward trends is in
the range 63—84%. In all platfroms, normalization leads to a
decrease in speciﬁc agreement for up and downward trends with

the exception of Affymetrix compared with Agilent data, where non
and baseline normalized data give approximately the same speciﬁc
agreement for upward trends. This is surprising, since the increase
in power induced by normalization (as indicated by the increased
number of rejections) should lead to the contrary and suggests that
normalization may introduce bias. Another indication of bias is the
considerable increase of gene numbers showing signiﬁcant trends
of opposite directions across platforms, if the analysis is based
on normalized instead of raw values. This is in clear violation
of the assumption that the platform tests the same hypothesis
considering the strict error control used in this analysis. This
negative effect of the normalization can be alleviated to some degree
by ﬁltering out genes with overall low expression values, which
improves both the agreement between platforms and decreases the
proportion of contradicting directional decisions (see Appendix E in
Supplementary Material). An analysis of the annotation quality of
our set of 5927 common probes in Appendix B in Supplementary
Material shows that further improvement of agreement (N 1% point)
can be achieved by using probes that solely match the sequences of
their annotated genes.

For all platforms and normalization methods, the speciﬁc
agreement between the analysis of raw and normalized data is (in
part considerably) lower for downward than for upward trends (see
Appendix D in Supplementary Material ). With the exception of the
Agilent platform, the number of discordant genes is relatively low.
This illustrates that the increase in downward trends on normalized
data is predominantly a result of genes with no signiﬁcant trend in
the raw data measurements, becoming signiﬁcant in the downward
direction after normalization. It has to be noted, however, that on raw
data one tests for signiﬁcant differences in absolute measurements.
Normalized data lead to expression values relative to an overall
amount of expression in a sample, hence possibly leading to different
null hypothesis. In this light, agreement across normalization reveals
more about both the distribution of expression values and amount
of systematic differences between samples than of the measurement
quality.

A comparison between Barlow’s E2 statistic and a statistic based
on the residual sum of squares from a linear model (see Appendix
F in Supplementary Material) shows that neither statistic performs
uniformly better in terms of power. Whereas the former identiﬁes
more genes (up to 4%) on non—normalized and baseline normalized
data (with the exception of Agilent), the latter rejects the null
hypothesis of no trend for more genes (up to 4%) on quantile
normalized data (see Table 4 in Appendix F in Supplementary

Material). Regarding agreement, both statistics perform equally
well. Barlow’s E2 statistic has power against a larger variety of
trends, whereas the linear model is only advantageous against linear
trends. Furthermore, and in contrast to the linear model, isotonic
regression does not require knowledge of the mixture proportions.

4 DISCUSSION

The methods suggested in this article allow the inference of
accuracy, repeatability and cross—platform agreement of genetic data
acquired from titration experiments. Exploiting only the postulated
monotonicity of this design, our framework needs little assumptions
on the underlying data generating process and is therefore applicable
to all sorts of genetic high—throughput data [e. g. the MAQC titration
experiment (Shippy et al., 2006)]. Such data are acquired from
numerable platforms each of which executes and preprocesses
slightly differently. Therefore, independence from the degree of
preprocessing is an essential requirement for an objective data
quality evaluation. Although the focus of this article has been on
microarrays, it has to be stressed that we derive our methods in the
absence of microarray—speciﬁc assumptions. This makes them easily
portable to upcoming technologies, as for example next—generation
sequencing.

The results from the EMERALD dataset demonstrate how our
methods provide easily interpretable quality metrics are on par with
results from the previous work on titration experiments (Barnes
et al., 2005; Hu et al., 2005; Maouche et al., 2008) as well
as corresponding ﬁndings from the MAQC project (Guo et al.,
2006; The MAQC Consortium, 2006). Additionally, we provide
new insights regarding the investigated normalization procedures.
To our knowledge, we are the ﬁrst to compare non—normalized to
normalized data, in the context of a microarray titration experiment,
that is designed with the aim to produce authentic biological data
with a proportion of differentially expressed genes larger than what
can be simulated using spike—in experiments. Therefore, it poses
an interesting challenge to the evaluation of such procedures. This
is due to common assumptions, namely that the true differentially
expressed genes are relatively few and balanced in terms of direction
(Stafford, 2008, chapter 2), being violated by the measurements
generated in such experiments. Under this premise, they provide
an opportunity to study the robustness of such procedures against
violations of their corresponding assumptions. The EMERALD
dataset highlights some of the pitfalls of microarray data analysis
and its subsequent interpretation. Initially, there is the issue whether
the large proportion of upward trends is a biological feature
or a procedural artifact. This phenomenon has been discussed
in (Shippy et al., 2006) and (Stafford, 2008, chapter 6) in the
context of the MAQC project titration experiment. The hypothesis
of unequal total to messenger RNA concentrations would be an
adequate explanation for many aspects of the data. Considering this
assumption, baseline and quantile normalization would appear to be
satisfactory candidate methods to remove such a trend. Our results
show, however, that the performance of neither baseline or quantile
normalization is convincing in the case of the EMERALD dataset.
The increase in non—monotonous trends, as well as directional
decisions being inconsistent across platforms, clearly indicates
the introduction of bias by normalization. Non—normalized data
provide preferable accuracy and agreement with the only slight
disadvantage in terms of repeatability. According to our results,

normalization poses a tradeoff between accuracy and agreement
on the one hand and repeatability and power on the other, when
dealing with a large proportion of differentially expressed genes.
This tradeoff should be considered in the choice of a normalization
procedure for experiments for which the assumption that the
proportion of differential expressed genes is small is likely to be
violated. Regarding general cross—platform gene comparisons, our
results show that the agreement across platforms using the same
normalization is higher than the agreement across normalizations
within one platform, making it advisable to decide on a single
normalization procedure. A signiﬁcant limitation of the agreement
measure used in this analysis is its dependency on the power
of the test and the distribution of alternative hypotheses. The
speciﬁc numbers are of limited generalizability with regard to
other experiments, where these conditions might differ. It might
be possible to construct alternative measures utilizing estimates of
the power (Zehetmayer and Posch, 2010) in order to achieve better
comparability between different studies.

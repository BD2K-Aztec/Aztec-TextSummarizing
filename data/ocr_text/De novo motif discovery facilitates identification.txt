ABSTRACT

Motivation: Gene regulation involves complicated mechanisms
such as cooperativity between a set of transcription factors (TFs).
Previous studies have used target genes shared by two TFs as
a clue to infer TF—TF interactions. However, this task remains
challenging because the target genes with low binding affinity
are frequently omitted by experimental data, especially when a
single strict threshold is employed. This article aims at improving
the accuracy of inferring TF—TF interactions by incorporating motif
discovery as a fundamental step when detecting overlapping targets
of TFs based on ChIP-chip data.

Results: The proposed method, simTFBS, outperforms three
nave methods that adopt fixed thresholds when inferring TF—
TF interactions based on ChIP-chip data. In addition, simTFBS
is compared with two advanced methods and demonstrates its
advantages in predicting TF—TF interactions. By comparing simTFBS
with predictions based on the set of available annotated yeast
TF binding motifs, we demonstrate that the good performance of
simTFBS is indeed coming from the additional motifs found by the
proposed procedures.

1 INTRODUCTION

Transcriptional regulation plays a key role in gene expression. It
typically takes place after the binding of transcription factors (TFs)
to speciﬁc promoter regions of genes. Usually, gene expression
is regulated by a group of TFs instead of a single TF. When the
inﬂuence of one TF on its target genes depends on the presence
or absence of another TF, it is said that these two TFs have
interactions in gene regulation (Wang et al., 2009). This article
aims at discovering TF—TF interactions that happen on the TF
binding sites (TFBSs) of the target genes the two TFs share.
Correct predictions of such interactions are important in studying
gene regulation.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

So far, several types of TF—TF interactions have been observed
and discussed. As exempliﬁed in Figure 1, two TFs, TF1 and TF2,
might form a complex and then bind to a common TFBS, which is
often represented by a TF binding motif (Fig. la). Alternatively,
they might utilize the DNA—binding domain of TF1 to bind to
DNA (Fig. lb). In this case, we say that TF2 indirectly binds to
the TFBS (piggy back) (Kar and Adhya, 2001). In both Figure la
and Figure lb, the two TFs interact with each other through direct
protein—protein interactions (PPIs). On the other hand, it is possible
that both TF1 and TF2 have their own DNA—binding domains and
respective TF binding motifs. As exempliﬁed in Figure 1c, TF1
and TF2 may not have direct contact but transcription is affected
when either one is absent. In this type of TF—TF interaction, the TFs
regulate expression of the target genes without directly interacting
with each other. Figure 1d demonstrates the situation that TF1 and
TF2 compete for the same TFBS. Furthermore, more complicated
situations might exist. For example, in Figure 1e, TF1 and TF2
alternatively cooperate with another TF to regulate genes.

Correct prediction of TF—TF interactions is a prerequisite for
understanding transcriptional regulation. According to the fact that
an interacting TF pair would jointly regulate a set of target genes, it is
intuitively considered that the interaction of a TF pair can be detected
by exploring the degree of shared target genes (Datta and Zhao,
2008). Before going into interaction inference, a reliable list of the
target genes of a TF should be constructed. Recent advances of high—
throughput tools provide such valuable information. For example,
chromatin immunoprecipitation chip (ChIP—chip) measures the
binding afﬁnity of TFs on speciﬁc DNA sequences in viva (Buck
and Lieb, 2004; Harbison et al., 2004; Ren et al., 2000). Two groups
previously published considerably large datasets of ChIP—chip for
yeast (Harbison et al., 2004; Lee et al., 2002). These resources have
been widely utilized to predict TF binding motifs (Chen et al., 2008;
Eden et al., 2007; MacIsaac et al., 2006; Narlikar et al., 2006; Linhart
et al., 2008) and discover cooperating TFs (Balaji et al., 2006;
Banerjee and Zhang, 2003; Chang et al., 2006; Datta and Zhao, 2008;
Kato et al., 2004; Pilpel et al., 2001; Tsai et al., 2005) in recent years.
Another useful technique to effectively detect TF—DNA interactions
in vitro is protein binding microarrays (PBMs) (Berger et al., 2006;
Bulyk, 2007; Bulyk et al., 1999, 2001; Mukherjee et al., 2004).
Badis et al. (2008) and Zhu et al. (2009), respectively, produced
datasets of PBM experiments and discovered yeast TFBSs based on
the detected DNA sequences.

Fig. 1. Transcription could be regulated by multiple TFs through direct or
indirect interactions. (3) TF1 and TF2 form complexes ﬁrst and bind to DNA
through a common TF binding site (TFBSl); (b) the complex of TF1 and TF2
utilizes the DNA—binding domain of TF1 to bind to TFBS2. It is said that TF2
indirectly binds to TFBS2; (c) TF1 binds to its own binding site (TFBS3),
and TF2 binds to its own binding site (TFBS4) on the same promoter. These
two TFs do not directly bind to each other; ((1) TF1 and TF2 compete for
TFBSS; and (e) a more complicated example: TF1 and TF2 alternatively
cooperate with another TF to regulate genes.

No matter which technology is adopted, one of the main issues
involved in the prediction of TF—TF interactions has been how to
collect target genes of a TF accurately. When handling ChIP—chip
data, many studies apply a consistent cutoff P—value to assign genes
as the targets of a TF (Chang et 611., 2006; Lemmens et 611., 2006;
McCord et 611., 2007; Tsai et 611., 2005; Wu et 611., 2007). However,
this strategy might miss true target genes (those with low binding
afﬁnity in ChIP—chip data) if the threshold is strict, or include fake
target genes in the list if the threshold is loose (Datta and Zhao,
2008). Accordingly, Datta et 611. proposed a method to dynamically
determine the threshold for collecting target gene set for a TF
based on the Expectation—Maximization (EM) algorithm (Datta and
Zhao, 2008). Nevertheless, the performance of employing dynamic
thresholds for determining target genes to infer TF cooperation has
not been comprehensively evaluated against literature.

Since TFBSs underlie the links between a TF and its target genes,
this article aims at incorporating automated motif discovery when
inferring TF—TF interactions. In other words, to more accurately
predict TF—TF interactions, we ﬁrst checked if a motif is respectively
enriched within the potential target genes of both of the two
TFs and considered the common motif that intuitively support the
predicted interaction. The proposed method, simTFBS, employs
motif discovery during ChIP—chip data analysis to improve the
quality of target gene lists identiﬁed. With the automatically
discovered motifs, simTFBS recruits more genes with low binding

afﬁnity from ChIP—chip data by requiring that the promoter region of
the gene must contain the de novo identiﬁed motif. In the end, each
predicted TF—TF interaction is reported along with the potentially
involved TF binding motifs, more than half of which were observed
to be similar to known regulatory motifs. The analyses conducted
in this study show that we can identify more known interacting TF
pairs without sacriﬁcing the speciﬁcity of the methodology.

2 MATERIALS AND METHODS
2.1 Dataset

ChIP—chip provides the information of genome—wide binding locations for a
given protein in vivo. A potential list of target genes of a TF can be collected
from ChIP—chip data by applying a ﬁxed threshold on the binding signiﬁcance
(P—values) (Chang etal., 2006; Lemmens e1611., 2006; McCord e1611., 2007;
Tsai et 611., 2005; Wu et 611., 2007). The examples shown in Figure 1 imply
that interacting TFs might be discovered by investigating the intersection
of the two target gene sets derived from ChIP—chip data. In this study, we
employed the ChIP—chip data from the study of Harbison et 611. (2004). This
dataset provides DNA—binding probabilities of 203 TFs under rich medium
(YPD) and 84 experiments under other conditions in yeast. In this study,
the ChIP—chip data of 203 TFs under all types of conditions (350 chips)
were used.

2.2 The proposed method: simTFBS

First, simTFBS collected lists of potential target genes based on ChIP—chip
data and generated putative binding motifs by motif discovery. With the set
of discovered potential motifs of each TF, we identiﬁed interacting TF pairs
based on the assumption that interacting TFs would share a set of common
genes and thus the motif discovery method might discover similar TF binding
motifs. The ﬂow chart of simTFBS is shown in Figure 2, and the detailed
procedures are illustrated as follows.

Motif discovery based on gene sets collected from ChIP-chip (Procedure
I in Fig. 2): for each TF, genes with P<0.001 (or >09) in its ChIP—chip
data were collected as the positive (or negative) set. It was required that
the number of genes in any positive set is >30. The setting of 30 genes
was desirable to fulﬁll the requirement of sufﬁcient positive sequences when
conducting motif discovery. It was observed that 30 is close to the minimum
number of positive sequences required to deliver satisfactory results of motif
discovery. If this condition was not fulﬁlled, the P—value cutoff (Pc) was
adjusted dynamically until it is satisﬁed. For all the genes in both of the
positive and negative sets, the 500 bp upstream sequences were considered
as the promoters and collected. Next, we executed motif discovery by the
algorithm proposed by Chen et 611. (2008) to generate 10 top—scored motifs
for a TF. This algorithm (eTFBS) was adopted because it has been shown
to achieve high accuracy in identifying TF—binding motifs from ChIP—chip
data. eTFBS uses a novel hybrid ranking system that considers not only the
preferential occurrence of a motif in a set of target sequences over a set of
non—target sequences, but also the binding strength of a TF to a putative
target promoter and the degree of evolutionary conservation of a predicted
motif. Readers can refer to Chen etal. (2008) for detailed parameter settings.
Here, for each TF, a list of 10 top—scored motifs with length longer than six
was reported. The predicted motifs were enriched in the positive sequences
(the promoters of high—afﬁnity genes). The deﬁnition of enrichment was set
as 25%, i.e. 25% of positive sequences must contain the discovered motifs.
These motifs are then used for the next procedure. In eTFBS, the speciﬁc
positions are grouped into two short motifs interleaved with a long gap. In
this study, the maximum gap length was set as 15. A motif in eTFBS is
represented as a collection of compatible consensus sequences. Substrings
in promoter sequences were detected as predicted TFBSs (also called motif
instances) if a match was found to consensus sequences (e.g. GCGnATC)
using regular expressions. In this study, a motif is also represented as a

position frequency matrix (PFM), which was constructed by the set of
predicted TFBSs from different target genes.

Identiﬁcation of similar TF binding motifs for a TF pair (Procedure 2
in Fig. 2 ): to be a pair of TFs for interaction prediction, it was required
in advance that the number of common target genes from the respective
positive sets collected in ‘procedure 1’ must be greater than zero. After that,
we checked whether there exists a pair of similar motifs across the motif lists
of the two TFs. The similarity of two motifs was examined by the following
two scores: (i) the similarity score between their PFMs; and (ii) the degree
of overlap between two predicted TFBS lists within the promoters of the
common genes. For a TF pair, we ﬁrst calculated the similarity scores of
PFMs, as in Chen et a1. (2008), between any pair of the 10 top—scored motifs
from the two TFs. The TF pairs with at least one score (100 combinations in
total) >0.8 are preserved. Then, for each motif pair with the similarity score
>0.8, the predicted TFBSs in promoter regions of the common genes were
respectively collected. A common TFBS was claimed as long as the motif
instances from two TFs shared at least half of the positions (nucleotides).
Let NA (NB) be the number of TFBSs from TF A (TF B), and NC be the
number of common TFBSs. It is supposed that the two lists of motif instances
would be highly concurrent if the two motifs represent the same TF binding
motif. In this regard, two motifs are considered as the same if the overlap
score, [(NC/NA) + (NC/NB)]/2, is greater than a preset threshold, which was
empirically set as 0.7 in this study. It is possible that one motif from TF A
is similar to more than one motif from TF B. If it happens, all the similar
motifs are merged into one PFM. In the end of Procedure 2, we reported a
list of non—redundant TF binding motifs for each of the potential interacting
TF pairs.

Reﬁnement of target gene lists by the discovered common motifs for a TF
pair (Procedure 3 in Fig. 2 ): the set of common TF binding motifs were
utilized to reﬁne the target gene set of each TF in a pair. For TF A (or TF
B), we used one of the common motifs (e. g. MOTIFx) to scan the promoter
regions of the genes obtained from the ChIP—chip data of TF A (or TF B).
A gene in the original positive target gene set of TF A (or TF B), called
high—afﬁnity genes of TF A (or TF B), would be selected in the reﬁned list of
TF A (or TF B) if it contains MOTIFx on its promoter region. Meanwhile,
a Pc—hybrid procedure is designed to identify low—afﬁnity genes as follows:
for a pair of TFs (TF A and TF B), a gene is a low—afﬁnity gene of TF A (TF
B) if it has a P—value ranging from 0.001 to 0.01 in the ChIP—chip data of
TF A (TF B) and is a high—afﬁnity gene of the other TF in the pair, TF B (TF
A). A low—afﬁnity gene of TF A (or TF B) will be preserved in the reﬁned
list of TF A (or TF B) if it contains MOTIFx on its promoter region.

TF-TF interaction prediction based on reﬁned target gene lists (Procedure
4 in Fig. 2 ): based on the reﬁned target sets of each TF in a pair, we calculated
the mutual information (MI) of each TF pair using the following equation,
provided in the study of Manke et a1. (2003). In this equation, I (x, y) denotes
the MI for a TF pair (x, y),

1(x.y)=Z p..2(x.y)<log  (1)

“a, Zpaomo)

where 01 and ﬂ, indicate the binding information of TF x and TF y,
respectively, and take values in the Boolean alphabet (0, 1); p(x) represents
the frequency distribution of binding information (0 or 1) for TF x; and p(x,
y) is the distribution over all possible combinations (00, 01, 10, or 11) for a
pair (x, y). Furthermore, a permutation test was constructed for estimating
the P—value of MI scores. For each TF pair, the background distribution
is constructed by 10,000 simulated MI scores, which were calculated by
utilizing randomly chosen target genes in an equal size of the two target gene
lists for both TFs in the pair. TF pairs with P< 0.01 would be considered
as interacting TF pairs. It is possible that a TF pair might have more than
one similar motif pair to support their interaction. In such cases, each similar
motif pair will go through Procedures 3 and 4 to calculate the MI score.
Finally, the largest MI score is taken for the query TF pair. Furthermore, the
predictions for a TF pair in different conditions are combined into a single
prediction. In this regard, the highest MI score is taken. In addition, TF—TF

interactions with MI scores >0.005 were categorized as predictions with
high conﬁdence. Finally, the predicted TF pairs are sorted based on their
MI scores instead of P—values in descending order, since all the P—values of
the 221 high—conﬁdent interacting pairs were highly signiﬁcant with values
close to zero.

2.3 Naive methods for comparison

For evaluating the performance of the proposed method, we considered
three na'1've methods of determining the sets of potential target genes for
comparison. Pc—0.001 and Pc—0.01 use a simple cutoff of P—values from the
ChIP—chip data as the threshold for identifying target genes (PC—0.001 means
P <0.001 and Pc—0.01 means P <0.01). The third method, Pc—hybrid, is a
hybrid approach that conditionally includes genes with lower afﬁnity as the
target genes of a TF. For a pair of TFs (TF A and TF B), a gene is considered
as a low—afﬁnity gene of TF A (TF B) if it has a P—value ranged from 0.001 to
0.01 in the ChIP—chip data of TF A (TF B) and is a high—afﬁnity (P < 0.001)
gene of TF B (TF A).

2.4 Collecting TF—TF interactions with literature
support for performance evaluation

To validate the proposed method, we collected the annotated interacting TF

pairs from heterogeneous sources and constructed the validation lists of TF—

TF interactions which mainly consist of protein—protein interacting pairs,

synergistic TF pairs and piggy—back TF pairs. Details of the collection of

validation lists are described in the Supplementary Material.

To be a TF pair in the validation list, we required that both TFs must have
ChIP—chip data from Harbison et a1. (2004). In the end, a validation set of
383 TF pairs was constructed for evaluation. We evaluated the performance
of the predicted results by counting the number of true positives (TPs) among
the lists of top—ranked interacting pairs and the calculated precision scores,
deﬁned by the value of TPs over the summation of TPs and false positives.

2.5 Collection of known regulatory motifs for
performance evaluation

To evaluate the quality of the motifs discovered by simTFBS, we collected
known motifs from literatures and database for comparison. The motifs
discovered by two recent studies (Badis et a1., 2008; Zhu et a1., 2009) based
on PBM experiments were included. In addition, we also collected annotated
motif matrices of yeast from the MYBS database (Tsai et a1., 2007) (104
motifs) to enlarge the list of known motifs. In total, 307 motifs for 170 TFs
were included in the ﬁnal list of known motifs.

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The proposed method, simTFBS, discovered 221 TF—TF
interactions as high conﬁdence pairs (with MI score > 0.005) based
on the ChIP—chip data of 203 TFs provided by Harbison et a1. (2004).
We ﬁrst compared its performance with three nai've methods. After
that, simTFBS was compared with two similar studies to show its
advantages. A small analysis was further designed to conﬁrm that the
good performance of simTFBS was truly from the discovered motifs.
Finally, we constructed a TF interacting network by incorporating
the predicted interactions with the annotated interactions from
literature. By examining this network, some interesting observations
were addressed and discussed.

3.1 Comparison of simTFBS with three naive methods

A ﬁxed P—value cutoff is commonly used to determine the target
genes of a TF when using ChIP—chip data. Here, two ﬁxed cutoff
values were used to determine the potential target genes, and the gene

TF-TF interactions

 

sets were then used to predict TF—TF interactions by calculating the
MI scores. It is noted in the caption of Figure 3 that naive methods
produced hits of higher orders of magnitude than simTFBS. The
situation that the naive methods predicted much more pairs might
be owing to the fact that the number of TF pairs for prediction is
large and it is likely for some of them to pass statistical test by
random. On the other hand, simTFBS requires at least one similar
(shared) motif to be present among the reported motifs of the two
TFs. By this way, the number of potential interacting TF pairs to be
considered decreased dramatically.

It can be seen in Figure 3 that using a stringent cutoff (e. g. Pc =
0.001) might exclude the information of low—afﬁnity targets which
results in limited identiﬁcation of true TF—TF interactions when
compared with simTFBS. On the other hand, using a loose cutoff
(e.g. Pc = 0.01) might retrieve low—afﬁnity target genes and also
include a great amount of false targets, resulting in false predictions
of TF—TF interactions. For the Pc—hybrid method described in
Subsection 2.3, the results in Figure 3 indicated that Pc—hybrid

Fig. 3. Comparison of the proposed method with naive methods of
determining target genes for a TF. The validation list containing 383
interacting pairs were used to evaluate the predicted 221 associated TF
pairs when compared with three naive methods. (a) Accumulated TPs in the
ranking list of each method; (b) precision evaluation. [The total numbers of
high conﬁdent TF pairs (MI > 0.005) a method ﬁnally predicts are: simTFBS:
221; Pc—0.01: 1499; Pc—0.001: 980; Pc—hybrid: 1797.]

generally performs better than Pc—0.001 and Pc—0.01 within the
region where the ﬁgures were plotted. However, fewer TPs were
discovered by Pc—hybrid than Pc—0.001 among the list of top—100
ranked TF pairs. On the other hand, simTFB S, which combines motif
discovery with the concept of Pc—hybrid, successfully improves the
predicted results when compared with the three naive methods.

To see whether the performance of simTFBS is signiﬁcantly
different from the other three naive methods, we converted the
number of TPs into proportions ranging from 0 to 1 and performed
a Kolmogorov—Smirnov (KS) test. The results from KS test
corroborate with our hypothesis that simTFBS is superior to the
other methods with extreme signiﬁcance (Supplementary Table S1).
In addition, we performed one—sided Fisher’s exact test to see
whether using different methods (simTFBS versus the compared
one) cause signiﬁcant changes in the distributions of true and false
positives among the 221 predicted pairs (Supplementary Table S2).
The highest signiﬁcance was observed on the difference between
simTFBS and Pc—0.01, followed by Pc—0.001 and then Pc—hybrid.
In Supplementary Table S2, we further grouped the numbers of
true and false negatives in gradient of the 50 top—ranked TF pairs
and re—performed the Fisher’s exact test in different groups. It is
then observed that simTFBS has superior performance over Pc—
0.01 among the 1~150 top—ranked TF pairs, while the superiority of
simTFBS over both Pc—hybrid and Pc—0.001 was observed among the
51~100 and the 101~150 top—ranked TF pairs, respectively. These
results demonstrated that simTFBS is able to assign true interacting
TF pairs with better scores by reﬁning the target gene sets through the
motif discovery process. In addition to the naive methods considered
here, a GSEA—based (Gene set enrichment analysis; Subramanian
et al., 2005) method was also considered as a potential method
without exploiting motif information for comparison. The GSEA—
based method has similar performance with the naive approaches
adopted here. The relevant materials and discussions can be found
in the Supplementary Material.

3.2 Comparison with two recent studies

The ﬁrst study for comparison is the work presented by Datta et a1.
(Datta and Zhao, 2008), where the authors proposed a method
to dynamically determine the threshold for collecting the target
gene set of a TF based on the EM algorithm. In the study of
Datta et al., the derived gene lists were then analyzed by log—
linear models to infer cooperative binding. The predictions based
on log—linear models were evaluated in the same way as was done
for simTFBS in Figure 3, denoted as ‘EM—LLM’ in Figure 4.
In addition, we also conducted the comparison of combining the
dynamically determined thresholds by the EM approach with the
MI score [Equation (1)] adopted in this study to predict TF—
TF interactions (denoted as ‘EM—MI’ in Fig. 4). It is shown in
Figure 4 that simTFBS outperforms both EM—LLM and EM—MI with
signiﬁcant improvements. The related statistical tests are provided
in Supplementary Table S3 and S4.

The second study for comparison is the work presented by Yu
et a1. (2006), Motif—PIE. Motif—PIE also utilizes a motif discovery
procedure when predicting interacting TF pairs. It collected known
target genes from literature or databases and employed Lee et al.’s
ChIP—chip data (Lee et al., 2002) to infer common target genes and
then predict TF—TF interactions. Though it was claimed in Motif—
PIE that 152 TFs were employed to make predictions, we only

successfully acquired a list of 126 TFs based on the descriptions
of data preparation provided in Motif—PIE. Among the 126 TFs, 115
TFs are in common with the 203 TFs used in this study. In this regard,
the comparison is based on the 115 TFs. The comparison shown in
Figure 5 reveals that simTFBS signiﬁcantly outperforms Motif—PIE
in predicting TF—TF interacting pairs. The related statistical tests are
provided in Supplementary Table S3 and S4.

3.3 Effect of recruiting de novo motifs

To investigate whether the novel motifs discovered by simTFBS
indeed improve the accuracy of TF—TF interaction prediction, we
re—conducted the predictions based on only the currently available
TF binding motifs with literature support, instead of invoking a
motif discovery tool. The 307 motifs were compared in a pair—wise
manner and high similarity (>0.8) was reported and considered as
the prediction for TF—TF interactions. This method discovered 24
TPs, considerably fewer than the 63 TPs delivered by simTFBS. The
result reveals that the discovered TFBSs successfully help to identify

more known interacting TF pairs and also improve the precision of
the methodology.

3.4 Support from literature or microarray data

Among the 221 TF pairs with high conﬁdence, 63 TF—TF
interactions are supported by literature or database annotation. The
predicted interactions were also examined from another aspect, to
see if they can be explained by including one or more TFs. We
say an interaction A—B can be reasonably explained if there exists
another TF C, where the interactions A—C and B—C are supported
by literature. There are 42 predicted interactions falling in this
category. Furthermore, we examined if a predicted interactions A—B
can be linked with two other TFs C and D, such that A—C, C—D
and D—B are supported by literature. It turns out that there are 37
interactions ﬁtting this criterion. In total, 142 predicted interactions
can be directly or indirectly explained by literature.

We further carried out Pearson’s product moment correlation
coefﬁcient test using the ‘cor.test’ function in R project
(Development Core Team of R, 2005) to investigate the degree

TF-TF interactions

 

of co—expression for each of the predicted TF pairs. The test
was performed on the TF pairs in the predicted list and in the
validation lists, respectively, using the time course microarray data
performed during cell cycle (alpha factor arrested) from Spellman
et a1. (1998). The correlation coefﬁcients and the corresponding P—
values for the predicted 221 pairs were provided in Supplementary
Table S5. In Supplementary Fig. S1, we compared the proportion
of the co—expressed pairs over the total pairs in different groups
(the predicted, the annotated and random) under several cutoffs of
P—values from correlation coefﬁcient test. The result shows that the
predicted group behaves similarly to the annotated group, and both
are superior to the average of 100 permutations of randomly selected
TF pairs.

In addition to ﬁnding literature or expression data support for the
predicted TF pairs, we also evaluated the biological meanings of
the discovered motifs by comparing them with the annotated TF
binding motifs, since the proposed method also outputted motifs
along with each TF interaction. These motifs play an essential role
in the predicting procedures of simTFBS as they were used to reﬁne
the target gene sets. In this regard, the motifs along with each TF
interaction were compared with annotated TF binding motifs. It
is observed that >60% (146 motifs) of the discovered motifs are
similar (similarity score >08) to known motifs. The information
of annotated motifs could be used to partition the predicted pairs
into four groups (Supplementary Fig. S2). There are 22 interactions
(Group 1) that are predicted based on a motif similar to both of the
TFs’ annotated motifs (21 cases) and two motifs similar to each of
the TF’s annotated motif, respectively (one case, STE12 and TECl).
For 62 interactions (Group 2), the associated motif is similar to the
annotated motif of only one of the TF pair. On the other hand, there
are another 62 interactions (Group 3) predicted based on a motif
similar to the annotated motif of another TF rather than the predicted
TF pair. Finally, we have 75 interactions categorized as ‘Group 4’,
of which the associated motifs are novel.

We subsequently examined the precision of each group based
on the validation list of TF—TF interactions, and it is observed
that the precision of different groups changes dramatically. The
highest precision (77.27%) was observed in ‘Group 1’, considerably
superior to the other three groups (‘Group 2’: 38.71%, ‘Group 3’:
19.35% and ‘Group 4’: 9.33%). It is noticed that the precision was
dramatically declined to < 10% when the information of annotated
regulatory motifs was insufﬁcient. This coincidence suggested that
the TF—TF interactions categorized in ‘Group 1’ might be easier to be
discovered (and thus are enriched in the collected validation list) than
TF—TF interactions associated with novel motifs (Group 4). Two
further observations also support this suspicion. First, the proportion
of TF pairs with co—expression proﬁles is observed to be higher
in ‘Group 1’ than in the other three groups (Supplementary Table
S6). Second, we observed that the motifs that are similar to known
TF binding motifs are more enriched in the high—afﬁnity targets of
corresponding TFs in ‘Group 1’ when compared with the other three
groups (Supplementary Table S7). Both observations reveal that the
TF pairs categorized in ‘Group 1’ are easier to be discovered and
thus have been largely studied. Therefore, the additional information
provided by the other three groups might greatly help to enlarge the
knowledge for TF—TF interactions. In addition, many TFs without
annotated TF binding motifs are found to have the motifs of other
TFs in their ChIP—chip data, resulting in some TPs in ‘Group 2’.
Moreover, by de novo motif discovery, simTFBS could discover

a TF—TF interaction mediated by another TF out of the predicted
interacting pair, resulting in some TPs in ‘Group 3’.

3.5 Investigation of the role of the predicted
interactions in inﬂuencing the network structure of
annotated interaction network

We conducted network analysis to investigate the role of the
predicted interactions in inﬂuencing the network structure of
the existing interaction network (383 annotated interactions). The
clustering coefﬁcient for estimating modularity (Watts and Strogatz,
1998) was employed to analyze the new network. The deﬁnition of
clustering coefﬁcient was described in the Supplementary Material.

This analysis was executed by in—house perl programs utilizing
‘Graph’ module. We investigated whether the clustering coefﬁcient
of the network is improved by incorporating the predicted 221 pairs
with the 383 annotated interactions (the new network contains 541
pairs in total, which include the 383 annotated interactions and
additional 158 predicted pairs). A permutation test was applied
and the details are provided in the Supplementary Material. It is
shown in Supplementary Fig. S3 that the clustering coefﬁcient was
signiﬁcantly increased when the predicted TF—TF interactions were
added (from green line to red line), whereas randomly generated
interactions in general decrease this measurement. This result
suggests that the TF—TF interactions help to improve the modularity
of the currently annotated interacting network, which might be still
largely incomplete.

3.6 Limitations of simTFBS

Since simTFBS heavily relies on the performance of the motif
ﬁnding step, in some cases the procedure might be unable to discover
TF—pairs due to the failed predictions of motif discovery. It was
observed in some TFs that the known binding motifs were not found
by eTFBS. For example, the binding motif of MIGl was not found
in the list of the 10 motifs reported for the ChIP—chip data of MIGl.
Though, the GAL4 binding motif was found in the ChIP—chip data of
GAL4, it was not enriched in the high—afﬁnity targets of MIGl. This
resulted in the failure of predicting the interaction between GAL4
and MIGl.

In addition, it was observed that many predictions were made
based on a single shared motif (i.e. only one motif of the TFs in the
pair was enriched in both TFs), instead of more than one motif as
expected (i.e. both motifs of the TFs in the pair were enriched in
both TFs). There are some potential reasons to explain why many of
the predictions were made based on a single shared motif. First, the
predicted TF pairs might be in the relationship of piggy back, e. g.
INO4 and CPU. Second, it is possible that one of the TFs does not
have an annotated binding motif yet. So, we did not know whether
it was found or not. Third, it is the failure of motif ﬁnding algorithm
that did not discover the expected motif for one of the TFs. In fact, it
is not the objective of simTFBS to ﬁnd the complete set of binding
motifs associated with the interacting TF pairs. It is shown in this
study that the information of shared motifs improves the accuracy
of predicting TF interactions, and one such motif should be enough
to achieve this goal.

There might be some potential biases associated with the design of
simTFBS. We have provided relevant discussion regarding this issue
in the Supplementary Material. In addition, though the proposed
method theoretically can predict all the interacting types elaborated

in Figure 1, it cannot tell the type of mechanisms without additional
information such as DNA—binding domains on the TFs. In this
regard, it is suggested to include more information regarding direct
or indirect binding derived by comparing ChIP and PBM data
(Gordan et al., 2009) or information of enrichment of biological
context to reﬁne the target gene sets in order to further improve the
accuracy of predicting TF interactions in future studies.

4 CONCLUSION

In this article, we proposed a new method that incorporates de novo
motif discovery in the procedures of analyzing ChIP—chip data.
The discovered motifs were employed to reﬁne the lists of target
genes, which further improve the accuracy of predicting interactions
between TFs by estimating the degree of target overlap between
two TFs more correctly. The evaluation conducted in this study
reveals that the proposed method, simTFB S, outperforms three naive
methods and two recent studies. The predicted TF—TF interactions
are shown to improve the modularity of the currently annotated
interacting network which might be still largely incomplete.

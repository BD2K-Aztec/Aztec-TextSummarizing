ABSTRACT

Motivation: The noisy nature of transcriptomic data hinders the
biological relevance of conventional network centrality measures,
often used to select gene candidates in co-expression networks.
Therefore, new tools and methods are required to improve the
prediction of mechanistically important transcriptional targets.
Results: We propose an original network centrality measure,
called annotation transcriptional centrality (ATC) computed by
integrating gene expression profiles from microarray experiments
with biological knowledge extracted from public genomic databases.
ATC computation algorithm delimits representative functional
domains in the co-expression network and then relies on this
information to find key nodes that modulate propagation of functional
influences within the network. We demonstrate ATC ability to
predict important genes in several experimental models and provide
improved biological relevance over conventional topological network
centrality measures.

Availability: ATC computational routine is implemented in a publicly
available tool named FunNet (www.funnet.info)

1 INTRODUCTION

In complex cellular environments, biological functions are emerging
properties that cannot be understood without taking into consid—
eration the system as a whole. Molecular interactions allow for
cellular components to function and for cells to live and perform
their tasks within the organism. It is through chemical and physical
interactions that molecules inﬂuence one another and carry out
biological functions. Since some of these inﬂuences may have
a greater impact than others, a hierarchical characterization of
their relative importance can be very useful in exploring the
functional architecture of the cellular environments. The concept
of interactional centrality is borrowed from social sciences where
it is used to estimate the relative importance of individuals
within societies (Freeman, 1977). Biological processes, viewed as

associations of molecules whose relations to each other assure
a particular function (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004; Hartwell et al.,
1999), have a strong interactional nature. Understanding interaction
patterns is therefore crucial in untangling the functional architecture
of cellular environments.

Network analysis plays an increasingly important role in the
exploration of complex interactional systems in numerous domains.
In biology, they are used to study regulation of the transcriptome,
proteome, metabolome, methylome and other cell systems (Kepes,
2007). Key properties of biological networks are shared with other
complex interaction systems, such as the ‘scale-free’ distribution of
node connectivity (Barabasi and Oltvai, 2004) or the ‘small-world’
aspect of their fast synchronization (Watts and Strogatz, 1998).
Others, like the existence of a hierarchical architecture of modules
formed by functionally related components (i.e. genes, enzymes
and metabolites) (Ravasz et al., 2002), or the presence of various
types of ‘hubs’ (i.e. highly connected or central nodes), which
modulate key interactions at distinct levels in the cell, are thought
to have a particular relevance in biology. The existence of strong
relationships between the biological roles of molecules and the
modular organization of their interactions was demonstrated through
analyses of integrating gene expression patterns with information
on phylogenetic variability, sharing of common transcriptional
binding sites, results from mutagenesis experiments and available
knowledge on genes’ biological roles (Allocco et al., 2004;
Bergmann et al., 2004; Carlson et al., 2006; Guimera and Nunes
Amaral, 2005; Hartwell et al., 1999; Jeong et al., 2001).

Hub molecules with important biological properties are identiﬁed
in these networks through topological interactional centrality
measures. Relying on results from mutagenesis experiments, Jeong
et al. (2001) showed that highly connected hub proteins that occupy
central positions in the network architecture of yeast protein—protein
interactions are three times more likely to be biologically essential
than those with only a small number of links in the network. Several
other studies have shown that proteins with high betweenness
centrality scores (i.e. measure of total number of shortest paths that
connect each two nodes in the network passing through a given one)
are more likely to be functionally essential (Joy et al., 2005; Yu et al.,
2007). Others have demonstrated strong correlations of network
topological centrality indices with speciﬁc patterns of phylogenetic
variability (Guimera and Nunes Amaral, 2005).

Microarray technology has been very successful in biomedical
research over the past decade. The study of gene expression

proﬁles in functional genomics and drug discovery is one of
the most important applications of microarrays. The analysis of
co—expression patterns using network representations is widely
used for exploring the large amount of data produced by this
high—throughput technology. Also called co—expression networks,
these abstractions illustrate the complex relationships between
expression proﬁles of individual genes. They are built by relating
transcripts (i.e. the nodes of the network) that display similar
expression proﬁles (i.e. the edges connecting the nodes) following
conventional analytical frameworks (Zhang and Horvath, 2005).
Topological centrality measures computed in network models, such
as node degree and betweenness, are used to identify molecular
targets in well—characterized protein—protein or regulation networks.
In transcriptional co—expression networks, the high degree of
experimental noise limits, however, the biological relevance and
robustness of centrality measures, based on topological criteria
alone, in predicting important transcripts (Wu, 2009). Integrating
expression data with available biological knowledge of genes
may help increase the biological pertinence of such measures.
We describe here an integrative approach that relies on a two—
layer network model, built by adding a functional layer on
top of the transcriptional one based on functional annotations
extracted from genomic databases. This approach allows delimiting
functional domains in the co—expression network, and then uses
this information to identify key nodes that play important roles
in the propagation and modulation of functional inﬂuences. To
this purpose, an original centrality measure called annotation
transcriptional centrality (ATC) was designed to quantify the
inﬂuence of each transcriptional node upon the propagation of
functional themes in the co—expression network. We demonstrate that
in the context of co—expression networks, ATC is more signiﬁcantly
effective than conventional topological indicators in predicting
functionally important transcripts.

2 METHODS
2.1 ATC

The knowledge gathered on functional roles of genes and proteins has
been structured and made available in public databases such as Gene
Ontology (GO) (Ashbumer et al., 2000) and KEGG (Kanehisa and Goto,
2000). G0 is organized around three main axes: (i) biological process,
(ii) molecular function and (iii) cellular component. ATC computation
algorithm starts by identifying genomic annotations from public databases,
which are signiﬁcantly overrepresented in the analyzed expression data.
Transcripts are related to their corresponding annotations, represented as sets
of transcriptional instances, to build a two—layer network model by adding
a functional layer on the top of the transcriptional co—expression network
(Henegar et al., 2008; Prifti et al., 2008) (see also Supplementary Section 3
for more information on the functional annotation procedure). A non—linear
dynamical system is then used to simulate the propagation of these genomic
annotations within the transcriptional co—expression network and compute a
functional measure of interactional centrality for each transcript. The initial
conﬁguration of the dynamic system is generated by assigning weights to
the categorical values of a relational table that represents the annotation
setup (i.e. transcripts and their genomic annotations), illustrated in Figures 1
and 2. The strategy employed for updating intermediary conﬁgurations of
the system relies on a transcriptional adjacency matrix representing the co—
expression network, as well as on a combining operator ‘69’. The edges
relating transcriptional nodes in the co—expression network can be valued
either in a weighted (i.e. in the interval [0,1], using a soft thresholding

technique) or an unweighted manner (i.e. as 1 or 0 for similar or non—similar,
through a hard thresholding approach) (Zhang and Horvath, 2005). We used
addition as combining operator because of its straightforward interpretation
and the well—understood convergence properties of the associated non—linear
dynamical systems (Gibson et al., 2000; Zhang et al., 2000). Considering this
operator, the amount of weight W5 . of a theme Aj associated with a transcript—
node t,- in a conﬁguration T 1’ (Figs 1 and 2) is computed as the sum of the
weights of Aj available in the previous conﬁguration T 17—1 in all transcript—

nodes connected to t,- (i.e. the dot product between the column vector A; _1
and the row vector t,- of the adjacency matrix computed from transcriptional
expression measurements). The column vectors of T p are normalized to the
unit after each step in order to keep constant the total amount of weight
associated with each annotating theme. The dynamical system convergence
is assessed using a combined criterion associating a co—inertia analysis with
a Mantel test. Co—inertia is a multivariate approach that identiﬁes trends
or co—relationships in complex datasets, and is particularly useful when the

lnteractional and functional centrality

 

number of variables exceeds the number of observations. It is therefore well
suited for a large number of analytical situations involving microarray data
(Culhane et al., 2003). The dynamical system is considered convergent when
the co—inertia of two consecutive conﬁgurations is greater than a threshold of
0.9 (i.e. on a [0,1] scale) and they demonstrate a signiﬁcant similarity assessed
with a Mantel test (Supplementary Fig. S2). The propagation of functional
attributes within the co—expression network is schematized in Figure 2a and
Supplementary Figure Sl where three annotations (represented by colors
blue, green and red) propagate in a 10—node network.

After the system’s convergence the role of each node in the modulation
and propagation of functional attributes within the co—expression network is
quantiﬁed by considering: (i) local information showing the amount of weight
associated with each annotation that passes through each node between each
two consecutive conﬁgurations and (ii) global information indicating how
much the system as a whole changes after each iteration. The amount of
weight associated with all annotations of a given node is computed using the
Euclidean distance between the annotation vectors lianil and mp of each
two consecutive conﬁgurations and the results are stored in the distance
matrix D, as shown by Equation (1) and Figure 2b.

(1)

 

This matrix is further weighted by multiplying each column vector D[1,n],p
with the global distance between each two consecutive conﬁgurations,
computed in relation to their co—inertia Cp 2 1 — co—inertia(T 17—1 , T p ) (vector
C in Fig. 2b). Eventually, the rows of the resulting weighted matrix D’ are
summed to compute the vector of ATC values. The algorithm was written
in R language for statistical computations (R Development Core Team,
2010) and was implemented into the FunNet package starting with version
1.08 (see Supplementary Section 5 for the pseudo code of the dynamical
system and the computation of ATC). It is also available via a web tool at
http://www.funnet.info (Prifti et al., 2008).

2.2 Experimental assessment

To evaluate the usefulness of ATC in spotting key functional transcripts
in co—expression networks, we analyzed its relationships to empirical
indicators of functional essentiality, derived from mutagenesis experiments,
and computational indicators of sequence phylogenetic conservation in
yeast. We used public microarray data related to cell—cycle conditions, since
cell cycle involves both phylogenetically conserved biological processes,
such as metabolism and transportation, as well as less conserved ones,
such as transcriptional regulation and signaling (Lopez—Bigas et al., 2008).
Another biological indicator of relevance in relation to cell cycle is
transcriptional periodicity, a measure of the relation between gene expression
and cell—cycle phases. Data from mutagenesis experiments were provided by
Saccharomyces genome deletion project (Winzeler et al., 1999). Our choice
in selecting these biological indicators was based on previous evidence
from the literature, which demonstrate that biologically essential proteins,
associated with non—viable phenotypes when mutated, are very connected
and central in protein—protein networks (Jeong et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2007).
They are also highly conserved phylogenetically (Drummond et al., 2005;
Jordan et al., 2002) due to a number of mechanisms that operate to restrain
the variability of genomic sequences involved in key cellular processes.
Eventually, robustness to the experimental noise affecting microarray data of
ATC and topological centrality measures was comparatively evaluated. This
assessment was performed by incorporating increasing amounts of random
noise in co—expression networks built from yeast and human microarray data.

2.2.1 Phylogenetic conservation score We deﬁned a phylogenetic
conservation score inspired by existing work on assessing phylogenetic
conservation of genomic sequences (Lopez—Bigas et al., 2008). Each gene
sequence sprefal- of the reference species spref (i.e. Saccharomyces Cerevisiae
in our case) was aligned against the complete genomes of nine other

considered for each species (Fig. 3a). Since the alignment score depends
on the sequence length, all similarity scores were normalized by dividing
them with the similarity scores of the sequences aligned to themselves
(2) as proposed by Lopez—Bigas et al. (2008). Considering the fact that
phylogenetic distances between species are variable, we used them to weight
the conservation scores (3). The phylogenetic distance between the reference

to a limited number of genes and not to the entire genomes.

downloaded from NCBI ftp servers and installed locally. The selection of

the different organisms was conditioned by the relatively small number of
completely sequenced genomes.

2.2.2 Microarray expression data Microarray expression data from six
different yeast cell—cycle experiments with a total of 123 cDNA—chips were
used in this study (Cho et al., 1998; de Lichtenberg et al., 2005; Pramila et al.,
2006; Spellman et al., 1998). These data were downloaded from Cyclebase
(Gauthier et al., 2008), a centralized database where the authors normalized,
synchronized and assigned periodicity signiﬁcance P—values illustrating
the relation between gene expression and the cell—cycle phases. Only the
expression proﬁles of 410 genes, which showed signiﬁcant periodicity in
all six experiments, were selected to build transcriptional co—expression
network used in subsequent analyses (see Supplementary Section 3). The
robustness of the various centrality measures to the experimental noise
affecting microarray data was evaluated based on yeast expression data,
as well as on a human dataset obtained from a series of white adipose
tissue biopsies performed in a set of 25 morbidly obese and 10 lean subjects
(Henegar et al., 2008).

2.2.3 Biological relevance of ATC Saccharomyces Genome Deletion
Project knocked off 90% of yeast’s genome and revealed that 17% of
the genes are essential for the cell to survive (Winzeler et al., 1999). We
relied on these data to compare ATC scores of essential and non—essential
genes. Non—parametric Wilcoxon rank tests were performed to assess whether
essential genes (74 out of 410) had signiﬁcantly higher ATC scores than
non—essential ones. ATC scores were computed using annotations from
three different databases: GO Biological Process (GOBP), GO Cellular
Component (GOCC) and KEGG.

Next, we computed the phylogenetic conservation scores for the 410
periodic genes, as explained above, and tested whether genes with the highest
phylogenetic conservation had higher ATC scores than less—conserved ones.
Since the phylogenetic conservation scores are continuous values, we used
the ﬁrst and last quartiles of the conservation score distribution to label genes
(i.e. conserved and non—conserved genes). Wilcoxon rank test was computed
to compare ATC scores of the two gene categories.

The ability of ATC in predicting biologically important genes linked
to cell cycle was also tested in relation to the transcriptional periodicity
score proposed in Cyclebase (Gauthier et al., 2008) (see also Supplementary
Section 3), based on the assumption that highly periodic genes are the most
functionally important for the cell cycle. Similarly, as for the phylogenetic
conservation scores, genes from the ﬁrst quartile of the periodicity score
distribution (i.e. those with the smallest periodicity P—values) were labeled
as periodic and those from the last quartile as non—periodic. Wilcoxon rank
tests were computed to compare ATC scores of the two gene categories in this
situation, as well as to test for additional relationships between phylogenetic
conservation, transcriptional periodicity and gene essentiality.

Zotenko et al. (2008) showed that in yeast protein interaction networks,
essential proteins tend to cluster in densely connected subnetworks with
other proteins that are involved in the same biological processes, and that
these subnetworks are rich in hubs. We investigated whether this was also
the case for the transcriptional co—expression network of yeast cell cycle.
A spectral clustering approach (Ng et al., 2001) was used in association
with Silhouette partition quality criteria to identify transcriptional modules
within the network. Fisher’s exact tests were further performed to evaluate the
enrichment of transcriptional modules in essential genes (i.e. to test whether
essential genes tend to cluster together in the same module).

2.2.4 Comparative assessment of topological centrality measures and ATC
Topological centrality measures, such as degree and node betweenness
centrality, were shown to be effective for identifying essential molecules
in well—characterized interaction networks such as yeast protein—protein
interaction or regulation networks (Jeong et al., 2001; Yu et al., 2007).
The same methodological approach as the one used in Section 2.2.3 for
ATC was employed to assess the ability of degree and node betweenness
centralities to predict essential, phylo genetically conserved or periodic genes.

The usefulness of ATC and topological centrality measures in predicting
essential genes in co—expression networks was compared through receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curves analysis (DeLong et al., 1988).

The robustness to noise of the three centrality measures was analyzed
by adding increasing levels of uniform random noise (1, 10, 20, 30, 40
and 50% of the n(n—l) number of possible edges composing of an n—
node network) to the co—expression network computed form the original data
through the hard thresholding approach described in Section 2.1. For each
noise level, we performed 30 consecutive iterations and computed the mean
values of each of the three centrality measures for every transcript. We then
used non—parametric Wilcoxon tests to assess whether the original centrality
values computed without noise, expressed as percentages of the total sum
of nodes’ centrality scores in the network, were signiﬁcantly different from
those computed after adding increasing levels of noise.

3 RESULTS
3.1 ATC relations with biological indicators of
relevance

Our assessment shows that essential genes have signiﬁcantly
higher ATC scores than non—essential ones (P < X10_5, Fig. 4a),
irrespective of the annotation systems used to compute these scores.
Figure 5a shows in red essential genes with ATC values in the
ﬁrst quartile of the distribution computed with GOCC and in blue
essential genes outside the ﬁrst quartile of the distribution (48.6%
of essential genes are found in the ﬁrst quartile of GOCC ATC score
distribution).

The analysis of the phylogenetic sequence conservation, another
indicator of functional importance, demonstrated an equally strong
relationship with ATC regardless of which annotation systems were
used to compute these scores. Figure 5b shows that 51.2% of the
genes belonging to the ﬁrst quartile of the phylogenetic conservation
score distribution (i.e. red nodes) are also found in the ﬁrst quartile
of ATC score distribution. Subsequent tests showed that genes with
the highest phylogenetic conservation scores (i.e. the ﬁrst quartile
of the distribution) also have higher ATC values than those with
lower conservation scores (i.e. the last quartile of the distribution;
P<5 x10—10, Fig. 4b).

Furthermore, ATC showed a signiﬁcant ability to predict
contextual functional importance, represented in our case by the
transcriptional periodicity during cell—cycle phases. Our evaluation
showed that genes with lower periodicity P—values, and thus
higher periodicity ranks, have higher ATC values than less periodic
genes (P < 5 X 10‘”, Fig. 4c), with 54.9% of periodic genes
found in the ﬁrst quartile of ATC distribution (Fig. 5c, nodes in
red).Additional analysis showed that essential genes display strong
phylogenetic conservation of their sequences compared with non—
essential genes (p < 8 X 10‘”). This result highlights the biological
relevance of the computational score of sequence phylogenetic
conservation, in agreement with previous work (Guimera and
Nunes Amaral, 2005). Moreover, highly conserved genes among
the 410 displaying signiﬁcant transcriptional periodicity during cell
cycle (i.e. with sequence conservation scores in the ﬁrst quartile of
the distribution), demonstrated a signiﬁcantly higher transcriptional
periodicity than less—conserved genes (P < 2 X 10‘16). Finally,
spectral clustering combined with Silhouette optimization criterion
identiﬁed two transcriptional modules in the yeast cell—cycle
co—expression network, with a majority of the essential genes
clustering together in one of the modules (P <0.05). The

mainly annotated by themes associated with cytoplasmic processes
in relation to cell division (i.e. ‘interphase’,‘microtubule-based
movement’, ‘cytoskeletal part’, ‘microtubule part’, ‘cytoplasmic
microtubule’, ‘cell division site part’, etc.).

3.2 Comparative assessment of ATC and topological
centrality measures

The individual assessment of the topological centrality measures
(degree and node betweenness centrality) in relation with the
mentioned indicators of biological relevance, demonstrated that
essential genes have higher degree centrality scores than non—
essential ones (P<0.05), but similar node betweenness scores.
This result supports previous work showing higher connectivity
of essential proteins in protein—protein interaction networks (Jeong
et al., 2001).

Furthermore, genes with high phylogenetic conservation scores
also demonstrated signiﬁcantly higher degree and betweenness
scores than less phylogenetically conserved ones (P< 5 X 10‘”).
A similar direct association was observed between transcriptional
periodicity scores and the two topological centrality measures (P <
5 x 10—30).

Comparative assessment through ROC analysis of ATC and
topological centralities showed signiﬁcantly better abilities of ATC,
computed either with GOCC or KEGG to identify essential genes
(P < 0.05, Fig. 6a).

Finally, no signiﬁcant difference between the original ATC scores
and those computed after adding noise was observed, even for a
50% level of random noise (see Supplementary Figs SS and S6
in Section 4 of the Supplementary Material). In contrast, similar
assessments performed for each of the two topological centrality
measures demonstrated a very signiﬁcant sensitivity to the random
noise, starting from the lowest noise level of 1%, particularly for
network betweenness that displayed the highest noise sensitivity.

4 DISCUSSION

Our assessment shows that conventional topological centrality
indexes are not equally useful in predicting essential genes in
yeast cell—cycle co—expression networks. Indeed, degree centrality
appeared to perform better than betweenness in spotting essential
genes. This ﬁnding contradicts previous data published by Yu et al.
(2007), which showed that node betweenness centrality is a better
indicator of functional essentiality than degree in regulatory and
other directed networks. However, as suggested by Zotenko et al.
(2008), in yeast protein interaction networks essential proteins tend
to participate in biological processes that are densely interconnected,
and which are therefore more likely to be hubs (i.e. highly connected
nodes). In our context, the advantage of degree centrality over
betweenness could be explained by an increased sensitivity of
the later to the high amount of noise, which is often wired in
the structure of the co—expression networks. This observation is

also supported by our assessment, which associates the highest
sensitivity to artiﬁcial random noise with betweenness centrality (see
Supplementary Tables S1 and S2). On the other hand, ATC predicts
essentiality better than both betweenness and degree centrality in
the transcriptional co—expression network built from cell—cycle data.
Our assessment indicated also that ATC is signiﬁcantly more robust
to experimental noise than topological measures. This advantage
may be related to the fact that ATC computation relies not only on
the topology of the co—expression network but also on its functional
architecture.

Furthermore, no signiﬁcant difference between ATC distributions
computed with the three annotation systems (GOCC, GOBP
and KEGG) was observed (Fig. 6b). This ﬁnding suggests an
equal usefulness of the available annotation systems, despite the
fragmentary character of the background knowledge on which they
rely. It is expected that annotation coverage and its biological
precision will continue to increase in the future and thus further
improve ATC prediction abilities.

5 CONCLUSIONS

In this study, we proposed an original centrality measure, the
ATC, aiming to improve the prediction of biologically relevant
gene targets within transcriptional co—expression networks. ATC
computation relies on the integration of microarray expression
proﬁles with biological knowledge extracted from public genomic
databases, which enrich the biological signal in transcriptomic data.
Its predictive abilities were assessed in relation to conventional
centrality measures based on topological criteria alone. It would
be interesting to further test ATC in application to other ‘omic’
networks, such as protein—protein interaction, regulation and
metabolic networks. From a different perspective, the biological
signal encoded in co—expression networks can be further enriched
by integrating other types of data, pertaining to gene transcription
(i.e. DNA methylation), to improve the biological relevance of
interactional centrality measures.

ABSTRACT

Summary: Here we present Sequence Variant Analyzer (SVA), a
software tool that assigns a predicted biological function to variants
identified in next-generation sequencing studies and provides a
browser to visualize the variants in their genomic contexts. SVA also
provides for flexible interaction with software implementing variant
association tests allowing users to consider both the bioinformatic
annotation of identified variants and the strength of their associations
with studied traits. We illustrate the annotation features of SVA using
two simple examples of sequenced genomes that harbor Mendelian
mutations.

1 INTRODUCTION

Recent advances in next— generation sequencing (NGS) technologies
have made it possible to search through entire genomes for variants
that inﬂuence traits of interest (Choi et al., 2009; Lupski et al., 2010;
Ng et al., 2009; Roach et al., 2010). However, analyzing NGS data
still requires addressing a number of considerable computational
challenges. A variety of methods have been developed to ﬁrstly
align the sequence reads (Langmead et al., 2009; Li and Durbin,
2009), and secondly to identify the genetic variants (Bentley et al.,
2008; Chen et al., 2009; Hormozdiari et al., 2009; Li et al., 2009).
In this work, we focus on the downstream annotation necessary for
the analysis of variants and provide simple means of visualizing
variants in their genomic context using a built—in genome browser
(Fig. 1). One fundamental difference from the previous approach of
using genome—wide association studies (GWAS) (McCarthy et al.,
2008), is that many of the variants identiﬁed in NGS will be
newly discovered. A second fundamental difference is that unlike
GWAS data, sequence data, at least in principle, provides complete

information about the variation present in a genome. For both of
these reasons, it is essential to develop a computational environment
that can assess the likely functions of the variants observed, and
whether or not they are present in existing variant databases. In most
contexts, such functional assignments will need to be considered
along with statistical association evidence in order to prioritize
variants in terms of their likelihoods of inﬂuencing traits of interest.
We also emphasize that in the early days of interpreting sequence
data for complex traits, the sequence data itself will often not be
sufﬁcient to provide statistical conﬁdence of association. Instead,
the bioinformatic prioritization helps to point towards variants of
interest that can be evaluated in much larger sample sets by direct
genotyping. We have designed Sequence Variant Analyzer (SVA) to
meet these challenges, and in this report, we use two examples to
illustrate some of the annotation features.

2 METHODS

SVA was developed using the Java programming language, using the
NetBeans IDE (Oracle, Redwood Shores, CA, USA). The graphical
user interface was developed using Java Swing. A standard edition
of SVA is available by DVD ROM, or a downloadable package
(http://www.svaproject.org/). Additionally, we provide a much smaller
evaluation edition. SVA uses a customized indexing, storing and optimizing

mechanism. Therefore, to run SVA, installation and optimization of
database systems is not required. SVA is also multiple—core aware, although
Input/Output (I/O) consumes the majority of the computational time. SVA is
an elaboration of WGAViewer (Ge et al., 2008), which was designed for the
interpretation of GWAS datasets.

A number of publicly available genomic and biological databases are used
by SVA for the annotation of genomic variants. We used the NCBI RefSeq
(Pruitt et al., 2007) as the reference genome in SVA. Both human reference
genome builds 36 and 37 are currently supported. We used the Ensembl
core and variation databases (Flicek et al., 2010) as the main source of
annotation features for genes and variations. We also provide options to
include user—speciﬁed annotation tracks, for example, gene annotation dataset
or transcription factor binding sites downloadable from the UCSC genome
browser. We used the HUGO Gene Nomenclature Committee (HGNC)
database as the primary source for naming canonical genes. Gene functions
were annotated by integrating information from the Ensembl core, the gene
ontology (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000), and the KEGG pathway databases
(Kanehisa et al., 2010). We used RefSNP, HapMap (Frazer et al., 2007), the
1000 Genomes Project (Durbin et al., 2010), and the DGV databases (Iafrate
et al., 2004) for checking the novelty of identiﬁed genetic variants. We will
release compiled annotation databases when new reference genome builds
become available. Within each reference genome build, users may update
their gene annotation databases by directly downloading the annotation data
ﬁles following our online instructions.

3 RESULTS

The SVA tool utilizes a knowledgebase of 8.9 GB, which is compiled
and compressed into DVD ROM or can be downloaded from the
SVA website. The main annotation functionality is performed locally
and does not require an active internet connection. This tool has two
distinct modules that allow analysis of the genomes included in a
given project: the annotation module is used to determine genomic
context and to predict the potential biological function of the
identiﬁed variants (for example, synonymous or nonsynonymous,
essential splice, etc.) in each genome. The results can then be
visualized in SVA’s built—in genome browser (visualization module).
The annotated variants can also be exported to a separate statistical
tool, for example ATAV (http://www.duke.edu/~minhe/atav/), to
assess their statistical associations with traits. Importantly, SVA
is designed to conveniently connect its bioinformatic annotations
with the statistical association tests so that users are allowed to
consider them both and even suggestive association evidence may
catch the users’ attention. There are also a number of integrated
bioinformatic listing functions in SVA designed to help prioritize
genetic variants. In broad overview, therefore, SVA inputs a set of
identiﬁed variants for each genome, annotates them for possible
functionality, and permits the user a variety of ways to visualize and
ﬁlter the resulting data with relationship to phenotypic information.
The basic principles of these core analyses are fairly simple, but the
strength of these analyses is their ability to be seamlessly run across
multiple genomes to prioritize all variants and genes at once.

Two examples illustrate SVA’s utility: To illustrate the simple
annotation features of SVA we have analyzed the sequence data
for subjects with two different Mendelian diseases. (1) Hemophilia
A is an X—linked recessive disorder that is characterized by excessive
bleeding due to improper clotting. Genetic mutations in the Factor
VIII gene are known to cause Hemophilia A; therefore, it is possible
to use this disease as a positive control. We annotated 10 case and
10 control genomes and found that the gene with the most cases
harboring a rare mutation was Factor VIII (F8) (Pelak et al., 2010).

An SVA genome browser view of one of the identiﬁed indels is
shown in Figure 1. (2) Metachondromatosis (MC) is an autosomal
dominant condition affecting bone growth. Our center performed a
whole—genome sequencing of one MC patient, following a linkage
analysis that implicated six candidate regions spanning a total of 42
MB. We took a three—step strategy: we ﬁrst applied SVA’s genomic
region ﬁlter; we next applied SVA’s novelty ﬁlters to identify variants
that were absent in dbSNP and absent in all eight control genomes;
and ﬁnally, we applied SVA’s functional ﬁlters to identify protein—
truncating variants. These ﬁltering steps quickly identify an 11—bp
frameshifting deletion on the PTPNI I gene as the cause, which was
validated in a separate family (Sobreira et al., 2010). We note that for
these simple cases no association tests are required (beyond rarity
or absence in controls), whereas in the case of complex traits SVA
would normally be used alongside a program like ATAV to facilitate
the consideration of variants that are both annotated as functional
and that show some degree of statistical association with trait values.

4 CONCLUSIONS AND DISCUSSION

The overriding philosophy of SVA is that the interpretation of whole—
genome sequence data beneﬁts from simultaneous consideration of
multiple lines of evidence, in particular bioinformatic annotation of
variant function and statistical genetic association with trait values.
We note this philosophy contrasts with what emerged as best
practice for GWAS in which all variants were implicitly considered
equally likely a priori to show association with traits (McCarthy
et al., 2008). While there are several genome browser and
annotation programs available today that are suitable for different
needs (Fiume et al., 2010; Robinson et al., 2011; Wang et al., 2010;
SeattleSeq: http://gvs.gs.washington.edu/SeattleSqunnotationl),
we are unaware of any that performs the integrated features of
SVA including: variant annotation and ﬁltering by function and/or
calling QC, visualization in a built—in browser and convenient
export of user selected variants for statistical association testing.
These features allow users to interact directly with the full set of
data that are relevant to making a judgment about which variants
show the strongest combined evidence of inﬂuencing the trait of
interest. We also note that the SVA framework is fully generalizable,
and over time we expect a number of new annotation features
to be incorporated which will take advantage of knowledge of
the functional regions of the human genome emerging from the
ENCODE project (Birney et al., 2007) and related activities.
Additionally, in principle, SVA could be modiﬁed to perform
annotations in other species. Future development plans include
developing versions of SVA in highly used model organisms.

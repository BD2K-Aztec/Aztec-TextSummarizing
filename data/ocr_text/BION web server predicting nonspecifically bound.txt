ABSTRACT

Motivation: Ions are essential component of the cell and frequently
are found bound to various macromolecules, in particular to proteins.
A binding of an ion to a protein greatly affects protein’s biophysical
characteristics and needs to be taken into account in any modeling
approach. However, ion’s bounded positions cannot be easily
revealed experimentally, especially if they are loosely bound to
macromolecular surface.

Results: Here, we report a web server, the BION web server, which
addresses the demand for tools of predicting surface bound ions, for
which specific interactions are not crucial; thus, they are difficult to
predict. The BION is easy to use web server that requires only coord-
inate file to be inputted, and the user is provided with various, but easy
to navigate, options. The coordinate file with predicted bound ions is
displayed on the output and is available for download.

1 INTRODUCTION

Ions are important component for all living cells, and they are
involved in different physiological processes, such as maintaining
the osmotic balance Williams, 1970) and the general ionic
environment (Bhattacharya, 2005) of the cells, participating in
signal transduction (McAinsh et al., 1997) and many others.
Because of that predicting ion’s positions is important for under-
standing various biological reactions. The need for predictions is
dictated by the difﬁculties different experimental techniques
experience in determining surface bound ions, as the residential
time and the occupancy may not be large; thus, the signal could
be weak.

Although there are many approaches for predicting speciﬁc-
ally bound ions as methods that are based on coordination num-
bers of ions (Katz et al., 1996), geometries (Babor et al., 2008;
Levy et al., 2009), binding site preferences (Dudev et al., 2003),
typical valence of metal ions (Muller et al., 2003) and many
others, to the best of our knowledge, there is no web server for
non-speciﬁcally bound surface ions predictions. Here, we report
such a web server, which is based on our new methodology using

Delphi (Li et al., 2012) and calculates the electrostatic potential
map in conjunction with an in-house clustering algorithm to pre-
dict non-speciﬁc ion binding sites (Petukh et al., 2012). This
method is implemented into a web server, the BION web
server, which allows predicting non-speciﬁc bound ions on the
surface of proteins. It is easy to use and intuitive for broad range
of users. As result of calculations the user receives a ﬁle in
Protein Data Base (PDB) format of protein with predicted ions
position ranked according to the conﬁdence of the predictions.

2 METHODS

2.1 BION web server algorithm

To successfully run the algorithm, the user should (i) upload protein
structure ﬁle in PDB format (or the ID number of corresponding protein
in PDB), (ii) choose the type of ion for which the position will be pre-
dicted and (0) select the number of ion positions to be predicted. The next
step involves in-house algorithm, which ﬁxes structural defects in the
protein with proﬁx software from Jackal package developed in Honig’s
laboratory (http://wiki.c2b2.columbia.edu/honiglab_public/index.php/
Software website: JACKAL) O(iang, 2002) and protonates the proteins,
i.e. generates missing hydrogen atoms, with MCCE software (Georgescu
et al., 2002) [AMBER force ﬁeld parameters Wang et al., 2004) are used].
The electrostatic potential distribution is calculated with the DelPhi soft-
ware (Li et al., 2012) with the following parameters: scale: 1A_1,
perﬁl = 70%, internal dielectric constant of the protein 4, external dielec-
tric constant of the water phase 80 and ionic strength 0.5 mol/l. The
details of the applied methodology are described in the Supplementary
Material and are similar, but not identical, to those described in our
original work (Petukh et al., 2012).

2.2 Benchmarking parameters

Rank: The predictions are based on the magnitude of the electrostatic
potential at selected surface-bound grid points. The representative grid
points are sorted in descending order (by absolute value) of the potential
(positive for negatively charged ions and negative for positive one), and
the position of a given point within this list is termed Rank. Thus, a
representative grid point being on third position within the ordered list
of N representative points is considered to be Rank: 3.

Receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves: The ability to predict
the experimental ion’s position and accuracy of the BION algorithm was
analyzed by generating ROC curves. The x-axis represents the Rank of the
closest representative grid point to the experimentally determined
ion position; whereas the y—axis represents the number of successful
predictions (true predictions) in percentage of all predictions. A predic-
tion is considered to be true if the distance between the predicted repre-
sentative grid point and the actual experimental ion position is <10
This criterion is chosen because of the parameters of the clustering
algorithm, resulting in that the shortest distance between representative
grid points is 21013..

Time of calculations: Total time that is required to perform all
calculations to predict the ion positions.

2.3 Web server architecture

The design of the BION server can be described by two basic parts, the
ﬁrst of which is the client or user interface, and the second of which is
the process that occurs on the server or back end. The client interface
is implemented using HTML (http://www.w3.org/TR/html5/) and
J avaScript (http: / /www.ecma-international.org/ publications / standards/
Ecma-262.htm). It is here that a user will ﬁll out various parameters
for a job to be submitted to the server, as well as receive the results of
the speciﬁed job. The back end request handling is implemented using
Python (http://python.org/). Later in the text we describe each part of the
processes in detail.

Client interface. This is where the user speciﬁes all necessary informa-
tion to complete a server job. The most important piece of information
the user must supply is a PDB ﬁle. A user may choose either to upload
a PDB ﬁle from their local ﬁle system, or they may enter the name of a
PDB ﬁle located in the RCSB PDB, which will then be downloaded by
the server. The next job parameter is the type of ion that will be predicted,
and it is selected using a simple drop down menu. The ﬁnal parameter,
which is not necessary for the user to change, is the number of binding
sites that will be predicted and will be appended to the PDB ﬁle.

Back end. The server end or back end is where the information speci-
ﬁed by the user is processed. Both the request handling method and the
calculation method are implemented in Python.

Results. If all user input was valid, then the results of their speciﬁed job
are returned to them. The basic output from the server includes a sum-
mary of the job and a ﬁxed version of the user’s submitted PDB ﬁle with
calculated ion binding sites appended. If the user requested the results to
be e-mailed, then this information will be sent to them in an e-mail to
which the ﬁxed PDB ﬁle is attached. From the actual client interface, the
user will have access to all of this returned information, as well as a Jmol
(http://www.jmol.org/) visualization of the protein, which also depicts
potential binding sites for the ion (Supplementary Fig. S1).

3 RESULTS AND DISCUSSION

The BION web server is based on the BION program that allows
predicting the position of non-speciﬁc bound ions on the surface
of protein. The key properties of the server, the accuracy and the
time, are analyzed. We benchmarked the results against the data-
base of proteins with experimentally determined surface ions
(for detailed description of dataset pruning for each type of
ions see Petukh, et al., 2012). The following types of ions were
tested: CA, CL, FE, K, NA, MG, MN and ZN (the list of PDB
ﬁles is available at the front page of the server).

3.1 Test of BION accuracy

For each type of ion, we constructed ROC curve by varying the
Rank, which essentially means by varying the number of predic-
tions (Supplementary Fig. S2). In ~50% of the cases for all

tested types of ions, there is a prediction within 10 A away
from the experimental ion’s position, which is found within the
ﬁrst 10 ranked points. In addition, enrichment curves are shown
in Supplementary Figure S3.

3.2 Total time of calculations

One of the most important parameter of any server performance
is how quick the user receives the results. According to the
Supplementary Figure S4, the average time is ~10 min.

3.3 Conclusions

The BION web server is a simple to use tool that uses new al-
gorithm for prediction of non-speciﬁc bound surface ions based
on electrostatic properties of the protein.

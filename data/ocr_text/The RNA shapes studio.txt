ABSTRACT

Motivation: Abstract shape analysis, first proposed in 2004, allows
one to extract several relevant structures from the folding space of an
RNA sequence, preferable to focusing in a single structure of minimal
free energy. We report recent extensions to this approach.

Results: We have rebuilt the original RNASHAPES as a repository of
components that allows us to integrate several established tools for
RNA structure analysis: RNASHAPES, RNAALISHAPES and PKNOTsRG,
including its recent extension PKISS. As a spin-off, we obtain heretofore
unavailable functionality: e. g. with PKISS, we can now perform abstract
shape analysis for structures holding pseudoknots up to the complex-
ity of kissing hairpin motifs. The new tool PALIKISS can predict kissing
hairpin motifs from aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the
functionality of the tools was also extended in manifold ways.
Availability and implementation: As before, the tool is available on
the Bielefeld Bioinformatics server at http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-biele
feld.de/rnashapesstudio.

1 THE RNA SHAPES STUDIO
1.1 Integration of tools for RNA abstract shape analysis

The framework of algebraic dynamic programming (ADP)
allows us to express dynamic programming algorithms for
sequence analysis on a high level of abstraction. They are com-
posed from signatures, tree grammars and evaluation algebras
(Giegerich et al., 2004a). Powerful product operations on
algebras allow one to derive new types of analysis by the
combination of available components, essentially with a single
keystroke (Steffen and Giegerich, 2005). Relying on the recent
BELLMAN’S GAP system (Sauthoff et al., 2013), which imple-
ments the ADP framework, we have built a repository of
components that allows us to integrate several established tools
for RNA structure analysis: RNASHAPES, RNAALISHAPES and
PKNOTSRG, including its recent extension PKISS. As a spin-off,
we obtain heretofore unavailable functionality: e. g. with PKIss,
we can now perform abstract shape analysis for structures hold-
ing pseudoknots up to the complexity of kissing hairpin motifs.
The new tool PALIKISS can predict kissing hairpin motifs from
aligned sequences. Along with the integration, the functionality

of the tools was also extended in manifold ways. Figure 1 gives
an overview.

1.2 Integrated tools and their new functionality

1.2.1 Extensions to RNASHAPES It is generally agreed that pre-
dicting a single structure of minimal free energy does not ad-
equately capture the subtlety and versatility of RNA structure
formation. The RNASHAPES tool introduced the notion of ab-
stract shapes (Giegerich et al., 2004b; VoB et al., 2006)—a (math-
ematically precise) characterization of structures by their
arrangement of helices. For example, ‘ [ [ ] [ ] [ ] ] ’ indicates
a Cloverleaf shape, and ‘ [_ [_[ ]_] ] ’ a single stem-loop with a
5’ bulge and an internal loop. Classical abstract shape analysis
reports minimum free energy structures from diﬂerent shape
classes, or Boltzmann structure probabilities accumulated by
shape. This gives synoptic information about the folding space
of a given RNA sequence, without heuristics or sampling.
Extending RNASHAPES, we added different modes of treating
dangling bases (consistent with RNAFOLD options —d0, —d1
and —d2) (Janssen et al., 2011; Lorenz et al., 2011), computation
of base pair probabilities and maximum expected accuracy
(MEA) folding (Lu et al., 2009).

1.2.2 Extensions to RNAALISHAPES The work of V08 (2006)
combines the ideas of RNAALIFOLD and RNASHAPES and per-
forms shape analysis based on pre—aligned RNA sequences. We
added the computation of a structure conservation index, differ-
ent dangling base models, MEA folding and a window mode.
RIBOSUM scoring (Bemhart et al., 2008) was added for evalu-
ating sequence similarity.

1.2.3 Extensions to PKIss In Theis et al. (2010) the ideas of
PKNOTSRG (Reeder and Giegerich, 2004) are extended to predict
(aside from unknotted structures and H-type pseudoknots) RNA
structures that exhibit kissing hairpin motifs in an arbitrarily
nested fashion, requiring 0(n4) time and 0(n2) space. We
added shape analysis, probabilities, different folding strategies
and different dangling base models. The —cast option provides
comparative prediction of pseudoknotted structures as in the
RNACAST approach (Reeder and Giegerich, 2005). A window
mode was also included.

1.2.4 New tool PALIKIss The program PALIKISS allows to pre-
dict pseudoknots, including kissing hairpins from aligned se-
quences. Being composed from the grammars and algebras of
the other tools, it inherits all the features and options that make
sense for it.

The RNA shapes studio

 

1.2.5 Utilities All tools were augmented with utilities to
compute folding energy or abstract shape for sequences that
are provided with a structure from an outside source, in a way
consistent with the tools’ energy model. The graphical motif de-
scription tool LOCOMOTIF (Reeder et al., 2007) now uses modules
from the RNA shapes studio. The KNOTINFRAME (Theis et al.,
2008) tool that predicts —1 ribosomal frameshifts has been
updated as well.

2 APPLICATION CASE: A FRAMESHIFT
STIMULATION ELEMENT IN MERS

The Corona virus family contains a frameshift stimulation elem-
ent (Baranov et al., 2005), where the frameshift is facilitated by a
slippery site together with either an H-type or a K-type pseudo-
knot. RFAM (Burge et al., 2013) holds the corresponding family
model RF00507, although the tools of RFAM cannot explicitly
model pseudoknots. PKISS (Theis et al., 2010) in —enforce
mode reveals that for 11 family members, minimal free energy
structures are H-types, another 11 are K-type pseudoknots
and for only one member a purely nested structure has the best
energy.

The recently sequenced MERS genome (KF958702. 1) is anno-
tated with a homologous frameshift site, whereas the structure of
the triggering element remains unclear. Structure prediction with
PKIss for a 100 bp stretch downstream the slippery site attests a
most stable K-type pseudoknot (see Fig. 2). A second run of
PKiss, this time in probability mode, shows that the shape class
of this particular K—type pseudoknot has an overwhelming
Boltzmann probability of w 99%; leaving not much probability
mass for any other shape classes.

3 AVAILABILITY

The RNA shapes studio is available at http://bibiserv.cebitec.uni-
bielefeld.de/rnashapesstudio. Users can access the BELLMAN’s
GAP source code of all components in the repository, and com-
bine or extend them according to their own goals. This has been
done, for example, in Reinkensmeier et al. (2011) for deﬁning the
CCUCCUCC-motif family in the Rhizobiales.

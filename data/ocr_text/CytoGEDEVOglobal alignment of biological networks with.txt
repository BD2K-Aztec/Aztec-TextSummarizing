Abstract

Motivation: In the systems biology era, high-throughput omics technologies have enabled the
unraveling of the interplay of some biological entities on a large scale (e.g. genes, proteins, metab-
olites or RNAs). Huge biological networks have emerged, where nodes correspond to these entities
and edges between them model their relations. Protein—protein interaction networks, for instance,
show the physical interactions of proteins in an organism. The comparison of such networks prom-
ises additional insights into protein and cell function as well as knowledge-transfer across species.
Several computational approaches have been developed previously to solve the network align-
ment (NA) problem, but only a few concentrate on the usability of the implemented tools for the
evaluation of protein—protein interactions by the end users (biologists and medical researchers).
Results: We have created CytoGEDEVO, a Cytoscape app for visual and user-assisted NA. It
extends the previous GEDEVO methodology for global pairwise NAs with new graphical and
functional features. Our main focus was on the usability, even by non-programmers and the inter-
pretability of the NA results with Cytoscape.

Availability and implementation: CytoGEDEVO is publicly available from the Cytoscape app store
at http://apps.cytoscape.org/apps/cytogedevo. In addition, we provide stand-alone command line
executables, source code, documentation and step-by—step user instructions at http://cytogedevo.

An increasing amount of data generated by omics technologies has
become available in recent years. Similar to the ubiquitous availabil-
ity of sequence data since the mid-20005, individual protein—protein
interactions (PPIs) have been organized as networks and collected in
online resources. Understanding networks is crucial to complement
our knowledge about protein function and evolution, which was ini-
tially gained through the DNA sequencing projects of the last dec-
ades. We believe that understanding differences and commonalities

potential to gain deeper insight into how a cell works as a whole
(Kuchaiev and Priulj, 2011). Network alignment (NA) is a method
to find a mapping between nodes in two or more networks, accord-
ing to some quality criterion. This allows transferring knowledge
between the aligned nodes. NA is generally categorized into global
and local methods: global NA results in a one-to-one mapping
between nodes, and local NA results in either many-to-many or one-
to-many mappings, depending on the method. Further distinction is

made between pairwise and multiple NA, which denotes the number
of networks that a method can align at the same time. An exhaustive
survey on the field is given in (Faisal et al., 2015).

Most tools are command line utilities with varying degrees of
stability (some are prone to crash, even under normal operation)
(Clark and Kalita, 2014) and almost none offer a user interface us-
able for subsequent network analysis. GraphCrunch2 (Kuchaiev
et al., 2011) has the dated GRAAL method built-in but lacks visual-
ization. Some web servers exist, which offer NA with limited visual-
ization, such as NatalieQ (El-Kebir et al., 2014) or NetAligner
(Pache and Aloy, 2012). GASOLINE (Micale et al., 2014) is a
Cytoscape app for multiple local NA with a user interface and visu-
alization capabilities. With the exception of these, none of the exist-
ing tools are particularly user-friendly or perform any other function
besides aligning a set of networks given as input files and return the
alignment result in an output file.

In addition, loading a previous intermediate result or an initially
given mapping for further refinement is not often supported by
existing software; notable exceptions are MAGNA (Saraph and
Milenkovic, 2014) and PiSwap (Chindelevitch et al., 2013), respect-
ively, which can be used to refine existing alignments. Most tools
rely on complex models (i.e. optimization functions) that make it
difficult for the user to understand why the algorithm aligns certain
nodes. This also hinders an intuitive understanding of the output.

Some methods (notably MI-GRAAL and MAGNA) offer opti-
mizing for multiple scores, e.g. scores derived from network top-
ology and from protein sequence alignments, which are often
contradictory. Most methods integrate two or more scores using a
weighted sum of the form  (x,- X score,) with 20:,- = 1. GHOST
(Patro and Kingsford, 2012) attempts to solve the disparity by calcu-
lating a ‘suitable’ weight automatically. More recently, this tradeoff
has been thoroughly evaluated for OptNetAlign (Clark and Kalita,
2015) and is still an unsolved problem.

Therefore, we have developed CytoGEDEVO as a Cytoscape
app, to make the alignment process more transparent, controllable
and ﬂexible. Cytoscape is a popular tool for network analysis, visu-
alization and exploration, which can be extended by third-party
apps. Our extension is a user-friendly software for pairwise global
NA, offering a user front-end that graphically aids with data ana-
lysis and follow-up studies. See the Advanced Tutorial
(CytoGEDEVO web site) for a case study. A summary of and cit-
ations for related NA tools are provided in Supplementary File S3.

2 Methods

2.1 Extended GEDEVO method

For CytoGEDEVO, we have extended the previous implementation
of GEDEVO (Ibragimov et al., 2013), which uses an evolutionary
algorithm to iteratively optimize a number of random initial align-
ments. Candidate alignments are modified using mutation and cross-
over operations to yield better scoring variants after each iteration.
The algorithm terminates after convergence is detected. The original
GEDEVO is a method for global topological graph alignment that
minimizes the so-called graph edit distance (GED), which is the
number of inserted, removed or otherwise modified edges. Since the
GED is originally defined for undirected networks only, we use an
extended GED model that uses per-edge modification penalties to
also account for direction changes. If a network is found to be undir-
ected, an optimized and slightly faster GED calculation method is
used. A short description of the basic GEDEVO algorithm and a
runtime discussion are given in Supplementary File S1.

Our extended approach is not limited to using only the GED as
possible optimization criterion. Any node-versus-node distance or
similarity measure can be integrated at the same time, for example
BLAST bit-scores or E-values, scores derived from Gene Ontology
(GO) similarities (Ashburner et al., 2000) or graphlet signatures
(Przulj et al., 2006). Multiple such functions may be combined. It is
also possible to solely use externally supplied data and entirely dis-
able the built-in topological measures, thus bypassing the shortcom-
ings of topological NA strategies.

In addition to a weighted sum to combine scores, we have inte-
grated cascaded scoring, i.e. out of multiple ‘stacked’ input scores,
the first score is taken if it exceeds a user-defined threshold, other-
wise the next score is taken and so on. This way, topology can be
incorporated as a ‘backup’ that is only considered if a more relevant
score, e.g. the BLAST-based sequence similarity of two nodes, is too
low. CytoGEDEVO can use weighted sum and cascaded scoring at
the same time. This addresses the tradeoff between topological and
biological features—one can typically optimize for either one but
not both at the same time without diminishing results in either
category.

If graphlets are used as similarity function, they are directly com-
puted on the ﬂy using Orca (Hocevar and Demsar, 2014), which can
compute graphlets of up to five nodes very quickly. Additional simi-
larity and distance functions may be integrated as precomputed all-
versus—all score files. Most aligners explicitly require BLAST bit
scores or E-values, with a fixed requirement for these scores to rep-
resent either distance or similarity. In CytoGEDEVO, this is handled
in a more ﬂexible way, as every input file can be customized such
that the algorithm can properly interpret the score type provided.

2.2 Cytoscape integration

By default, the result of an alignment is a single Cytoscape network
that shows both input networks side-by-side, with aligned nodes in
the same relative positions. Alignments performed with
CytoGEDEVO are fully resumable, i.e. an alignment process can be
suspended at any time, visualized, corrected, parameters may be
optimized and resumed. Intermediate results may also be studied,
visualized and stored for further optimization at later time points.
Internal scores are imported as Cytoscape data tables, which can be
used to apply visual styles to nodes and edges. Parameters are easily
configurable using the app and come with explanations and error
checking. For datasets where prior knowledge is available, corres-
ponding node pairs can be assigned manually, which is expected to
be particularly helpful for incomplete networks or networks from
evolutionarily distant organisms. Furthermore, CytoGEDEVO can
be used to import/export alignments, such that results obtained by
the command-line version or other aligners can be analyzed and
refined as well. This is useful if long-running computations are per-
formed remotely and only the analysis is done on a client machine.
Aligned network pairs can be visualized using pair layout variants
that are derived from existing layouts, including new layouts pro-
vided by other apps. CytoGEDEVO can be used to highlight com-
mon connected subgraphs and visualize scores by applying various
coloring presets to the network. See the Supplementary File 52 and
documentation for examples.

3 Discussion and conclusion

CytoGEDEVO is an extension of the GEDEVO software, which
provides significant graphical and functional improvements. We ex-
pect CytoGEDEVO to make NAs much more user-friendly and

applicable to end users and easier to interpret for human experts.
The app features a number of built-in topological and biological
alignment optimization criteria and can incorporate any number of
externally supplied node similarities or distances. The basic
GEDEVO global topological alignment algorithm was evaluated ex-
haustively in Ibragimov et al. (2013). See Supplementary File S1 for
a summary. The underlying model is intuitively understandable, and
the user can easily incorporate any custom node similarity measure.
CytoGEDEVO improves the use of NA as it can be used to visualize
the result of any NA tool in Cytoscape.

Abstract

Summary: The experimental determination of membrane protein orientation within the lipid bi-
layer is extremely challenging, such that computational methods are most often the only solution.
Moreover, obtaining all-atom 3D structures of membrane proteins is also technically difficult, and
many of the available data are either experimental low-resolution structures or theoretical models,
whose structural quality needs to be evaluated. Here, to address these two crucial problems, we
propose OREMPRO, a web server capable of both (i) positioning or-helical and B-sheet transmem-
brane domains in the lipid bilayer and (ii) assessing their structural quality. Most importantly,
OREMPRO uses the sole alpha carbon coordinates, which makes it the only web server compatible
with both high and low structural resolutions. Finally, OREMPRO is also interesting in its ability to
process coarse-grained protein models, by using coordinates of backbone beads in place of alpha

carbons.

1 Introduction

Determining the orientation of membrane protein structures in the
lipid bilayer is necessary to understand their function—with numer-
ous medical and industrial applications. Membrane proteins are dif-
ficult to study, due to the laborious and expensive solubilization,
purification and reconstitution methods they require. This is wors-
ened by the need of working on multimeric complexes, since mem-
brane proteins often function as such. Actually, the orientational
disorder that exists in the lipid bilayer makes membrane positioning
so difficult that data are available for only ~20 proteins (Nugent
and Jones, 2013), which most often makes computational methods
the last resort (besides visual analysis). Moreover, the determination
of an all-atom structure of membrane protein is already a challenge,
and the relevance of positioning side-chains in environments that

strongly differ from a biological lipid bilayer (i.e. detergents and
solvents) is questionable. These difficulties result in an important
number of ‘low-resolution’ structures (N-Coc-CO backbones and Coc-
only), the quality of which needs to be evaluated. The same goes for
the modelling of membrane protein structure, which is less advanced
than for globular proteins, due to the complexity of the lipid envir-
onment, therefore making low-resolution and coarse-grained
approaches widely used. Here, we present OREMPRO, the first web
server aimed at orienting and evaluating membrane protein struc-
tures (alpha and beta) from the sole Cor coordinates, and thus com-
patible with both high and low structural resolutions. Our web
server is also able to process coarse-grained structures, such as those
used with the MARTINI force field (Marrink et al., 2007), by using
coordinates of backbone beads (‘BB’) in place of Car.

OREMPRO web server: orientation and assessment of atomistic and coarse-grained structures 2549

 

2 Methods

2.1 Web interface

Our web server integrates the two MAIDEN (Postic et al., 2015)
and ANVIL (Postic et al., 2016) algorithms, which are aimed at ori-
enting and evaluating membrane protein structures, respectively,
and have shown high accuracies in extensive and rigorous bench-
marks. Through the user-friendly interface, which does not require
any registration, users can upload a protein coordinate file in the
PDB format, select options, and start the calculations. If no PDB file
is submitted, OREMPRO can still be tested with an example. The
resulting membrane assignment of the protein 3D structure is inter-
actively displayed with the PV molecular viewer (Biasini, 2014). The
server automatically adapts the visual representation of the struc-
ture, depending on the type of data submitted—e.g., ’spheres’ for
Cor-only and coarse-grained models. The output structure with its
membrane can be downloaded as a PDB file. The results page also
contains bilayer thickness, sequence positions, and tilt angles for
each transmembrane segment assigned, and the MAIDEN quality
score. The results are kept on the server and can be accessed later at
the same address.

2.2 Membrane positioning

The positioning of the structure in the lipid bilayer is achieved by
using the ANVIL algorithm, which follows an innovative approach
whereby the membrane assignment problem is treated as a binary
classification. The algorithm performs an orientational search of the
best fitting membrane, trying to maximize a C—value that is similar to
a Matthews Correlation Coefficient. In this web server version, two
novel features are proposed, in addition to the options that were al-
ready present in the stand-alone version. First, we have implemented
the possibility of using a geometrical criterion to improve the mem-
brane assignment for certain types of protein structures (see
Supplementary information). The other new option is the possibility
to select the residue types which, in the binary classification, will be
considered as having the tendency to be located either within the
membrane (M) or at one of the two sides of the lipid bilayer (S). This
new option has emerged as necessary, since all biological membranes
do not have the same lipid composition and, therefore, might require
different separations of the 20 residue types into the two M and S cat-
egories. Additionally, a weight can be defined for each residue type
(positive defines M, negative defines S). For example, the Gly amino
acids may be categorized as M, but with a weight of +0.1 rather
than +1.0, in order to take into account the low hydrophobicity of
this residue type. In this way, instead of using the default dichotom-
ized membrane propensity scale of ANVIL—which is derived from
the PM1D scale (Punta and Maritan, 2003)—users can test any of the
existing hydrophobicity scales or even develop new ones. Finally,
since the C-value does not have any cutoff to discriminate membrane
proteins from globular ones, the algorithm will always try to assign a
membrane, without regarding the type of protein submitted. This is
particularly important, since it makes OREMPRO able to process
structural models of medium and low qualities that may not be recog-
nized as membrane proteins by other methods.

2.3 Structural assessment

Following the membrane assignment by ANVIL, a structural assess-
ment is performed with MAIDEN, which is a distance-dependent
statistical potential, analog of the DOPE score (Shen and Sali, 2006)
but optimized on a dataset of membrane protein structures. For this
web server version, new features that were not available on the
stand-alone version of MAIDEN have been developed. For example,

if one wants to calculate the MAIDEN pseudo-energy (or score) for
another transmembrane domain than that delimited by ANVIL,
then the web interface offers the possibility to manually define the
lipid bilayer boundaries, by entering residue positions of each trans-
membrane segment. This new option allows calculating the
MAIDEN score from membrane assignments produced by other
positioning algorithms than ANVIL, such as OPM (Lomize et al.,
2012) or TMDET (Tusnady et al., 2005). Another new feature is the
possibility to download a detailed list (in text format) of the pseudo-
energies for all the residue pairs in the query structure.

The MAIDEN score measures the relative quality of protein struc-
tures, which means that it can be used to rank several models by their
quality: the lower the pseudo-energy, the better the model. However,
to have an idea of the absolute quality of a single structure, we have
added to the MAIDEN score a color code that is derived from a Z-
score calculation of the pseudo-energy. This Z-score is calculated by
(17¢S — ,u,)/o,, where 125 is the pseudo-energy of the assessed structure, u,
and a, are the mean and standard deviation of the pseudo-energy dis-
tribution of random sequence decoys. Each of these decoys is gener-
ated by randomly permuting the primary sequence of the protein
(to <5 0% sequence identity) while keeping the coordinates of the
side chain centers unchanged (Melo et al., 2002), and therefore has a
very high (positive) pseudo-energy. To ease interpretation, the Z-
score is converted into a color code, with the red color corresponding
to a Z-score 20, which means that the evaluated structure is not dis-
tinguishable from random decoys by the pseudo-energy.

3 Conclusion

Thanks to the use of a minimalistic representation of protein struc-
tures, OREMPRO is the first web server capable of processing low-
resolution and coarse-grained models of membrane proteins, thus
meeting the need for treating the growing number of these struc-
tures. Our web server offers a complementary combination of mem-
brane assignment and structural quality assessment, by integrating
the innovative ANVIL membrane positioning algorithm and the
MAIDEN statistical potential into a user-friendly interface. Despite
its dual function, OREMPRO is fast and processes most protein
structures within a minute.

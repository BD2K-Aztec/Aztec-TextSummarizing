ABSTRACT
Motivation: Cellular information processing can be described
mathematically using differential equations. Often, external
stimulation of cells by compounds such as drugs or hormones
leading to activation has to be considered. Mathematically, the
stimulus is represented by a time-dependent input function.
Parameters such as rate constants of the molecular interactions
are often unknown and need to be estimated from experimental data,
e.g. by maximum likelihood estimation. For this purpose, the input
function has to be defined for all times of the integration interval.
This is usually achieved by approximating the input by interpolation
or smoothing of the measured data. This procedure is suboptimal
since the input uncertainties are not considered in the estimation
process which often leads to overoptimistic confidence intervals of
the inferred parameters and the model dynamics.
Results: This article presents a new approach which includes
the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical
model parameters by minimizing an objective function containing
all parameters simultaneously. We applied this comprehensive
approach to an illustrative model with simulated data and compared it
to alternative methods. Statistical analyses revealed that our method
improves the prediction of the model dynamics and the confidence
intervals leading to a proper coverage of the confidence intervals of
the dynamic parameters. The method was applied to the JAK-STAT
signaling pathway.

1 INTRODUCTION

Mathematical modeling of biological systems has become a widely
used approach to better understand the system behavior as a whole
rather than observing isolated parts (Kitano, 2002). The rapid
development in quantitative molecular biology (Cox and Mann,
2011) enables to calibrate mathematical models to experimental
data and therefore generating model predictions. For parametric
models, such as ordinary differential equation (ODE) models,
calibration can be performed e. g. by maximum likelihood estimation
(MLE). Uncertainties of the measurements generated by biological
variability or technical limitations have to be considered in the
calibration process as they propagate to the parameter estimates.

 

*To whom correspondence should be addressed.

An accurate method for calculating conﬁdence intervals is given by
the proﬁle likelihood approach (Raue et al., 2009).

One unresolved issue in data-based modeling is the insufﬁcient
consideration of input measurement uncertainties in the parameter
estimation process. In this article, we solve this problem with a
new approach. The method presented in the following includes
the input estimation into the estimation process of the dynamical
model parameters by minimizing an objective function containing
all parameters simultaneously. An illustrative model with known
parameter values and noise distributions reveals that our method is
able to (i) increase the precision of the parameter estimates and (ii)
correct the coverage of the likelihood-based conﬁdence intervals.

Furthermore, we applied the method to a model of the JAK-
STAT signaling pathway introduced by Swameye et al. (2003)
where quantitative biological data are available, leading to different
estimated dynamics of the model trajectories compared to the
standard method.

2 METHODS

2.1 Models of biochemical reaction networks

A mathematical model M of a biochemical reaction network is given by a
set of coupled ODEs

i<r>=f6c<t>ﬁ<tva> <1)
53(t) = §(3E(t), ii(t), 3") + 3(t) with 6,-(t) =N(0, 01-2), (2)

where xi(t) are the internal states of the system, ui(t) are the time dependent
external stimuli, also called input ﬁmctions and yi(t) are the noisy observables
of the system with a noise level 0,.

The set of parameters that deﬁnes M uniquely contains dynamic
parameters 13, i.e. for instance rate constants, scaling and oﬁfset parameters

All analyses have been performed on a logarithmic scale.

2.2 Parameter estimation

We performed MLE which is equivalent to the weighted least squares method
for Gaussian noise. Thus, an objective function

N i 2

is minimized and
0 =argni9inx2(0). (5)

is the maximum likelihood estimator where y: denotes the measured data
and y(x(t,-,0),u(t,-),0) represents the model output. In order not to rely on

the mere point estimate, likelihood proﬁles will be computed as discussed in
more detail in the Supplementary Information.

2.3 Existing methods

For integration of the ODEs, a continuous representation of a discretely
measured input is required. In the past, time-dependent input functions u(t)
have been represented by constant input functions Bachmann et al. (2011),
linear interpolations of the dataset (Quach et al., 2007; Swameye et al.,
2003), cubic interpolation splines or by cubic smoothing splines (Maiwald
and Timmer, 2008; Raue et al., 2009).

If the functional representation of the input data is estimated separately
from the dynamical model parameters, the deviations from the true
underlying dynamics of the input are not considered in the estimation of
the model parameters. This can result on the one hand in biased estimates
of the dynamic parameters and on the other hand, even more likely, in
underestimated conﬁdence intervals as the input uncertainties have not been
taken into account. This problem shall be addressed in the following by
deﬁning a suitable input parametrization that enables to estimate input and
dynamical parameters comprehensively.

2.4 Splines

A spline is a piecewise polynomial that interpolates a given set of data points
yir, ...,y;, at time points t1, ...,tN in a smooth and continuous manner. The
y-values to be interpolated are called control points and the corresponding t-
values knots. Boundary conditions determine either the slope or the curvature
of the spline at the ﬁrst and the last data point. Here, cubic splines with natural
boundary conditions, i.e. the curvature at both end points is set to zero, are
utilized.

A cubic interpolation spline can be described either by a set of knots and
the corresponding four coefﬁcients for each polynomial piece or by a linear
combination of a set of basis functions in the basis spline (B-spline) notation.
For a knot sequence t1, . .., tN and its corresponding control points v1, ...,vN,
the B-spline is given by (de Boor, 1978)

N —p—1
so) = Z v,b,-,p(t) with re [t1+,,, tN_p], (6)
i=1
where N is the number of data points and p is the degree of the basis functions
bi,p(t), thus, in case of cubic polynomials, p = 3. The closed-form expression
of the basis functions is given in the Supplementary Information.

Another type of spline, that is frequently used, is the cubic smoothing

spline. A smoothing spline

N i 2 t

can, depending on its respective measurement uncertainties oi, deviate

curvature

from the data points y: in order to form a smoother curve. Therefore,
an objective function is to be minimized, containing both the deviation
from the data and the curvature, i.e. the second term in (7). The so-
called smoothing or penalization parameter A e [0, 00) controls the trade-off
between interpolating the noisy data and obtaining a smooth function. As
a consequence, A=0 results in an interpolation spline, whereas A—> 00
corresponds to a linear ﬁt of the input data.

Interpolation splines often lead to strongly oscillating input function
estimates. Therefore, smoothing splines usually lead to more realistic
outcomes if the smoothing parameter A can be chosen reasonably.

A smoothing spline can be unambiguously represented either by the data
points yi, . . . ,y;, the knot sequence t1, ...,tN and the smoothing parameter A
or by the knots t1, ...,tN and the corresponding control points v1, ,vN, that
are the obtained by evaluation of Equation 7, i.e. v,- = 3(a). Therefore, for the
approach presented in the following, the control points v1, ,vN are used as

input parametrization even though the spline is smoothed by penalizing the
curvature.

2.5 Assessment criteria

The performance of the approach is assessed by the accuracy

«41-2: |(p(5i))| with éi=log10<éi/ame,i). <8)

and the precision
731' 2= \/ Vaf(P(5i)), (9)

i.e. the standard deviation of the distribution of the parameter estimates, if
many independent estimations are performed over simulated data for known
true parameter values.

Moreover, the deviation from the true trajectory is quantiﬁed by the score
N A 2
S(yi)=Z<Yi(6,9true)—)’i(6,9)) , (10)

j=1
where tj e [to, tend] is densely sampled at 500 equidistant time points.

The coverage ratio, i.e. the probability that the true parameters are inside
the conﬁdence intervals, is calculated using the likelihood-based conﬁdence
intervals for many noise realization as described in more detail in the
Supplementary Information. This value can be compared to the desired
coverage, i.e. the corresponding a level.

2.6 Approach

The new approach aims to include the estimation of the input function into
the maximum likelihood estimation of the model parameters. Therefore, a
parametrization for the input measurements is needed.

A cubic spline is uniquely deﬁned by the set of data points it is ﬁtted to.
This is best visible in the B-spline notation introduced in Equation 6. Thus,
the input can be parametrized using the control points v1, ...,vN of the spline
as parameters.

The optimal set of parameters is then obtained by minimizing an objective
function

m Ni y;-—yi<x(y.0*),u<y,e*),e*)

warez:

that contains both input and downstream parameters as well as a term that
penalizes the curvature of the input functions. The smoothing parameter A is

selected based on x 2-statistic as described in the Supplementary Information.
Note that the ﬁrst term in Equation 11 accounts for the deviation of the model

 

(11)

yi(tj) from the data y;- for all observables including the input.
The extended parameter set to be optimized is

0*:{p,?c(to),13,§}. (12)

In the following, 0* —>0 will be used to keep the notation as simple as
possible.

Input measurements are usually concentrations or relative measurements
like receptor activation and therefore strictly positive. A spline can become
negative between the positive measurement points leading to reversed
reaction ﬂuxes and incorrect model behavior. To avoid negativity of the
spline function, the input is transformed to logarithmic scale.

3 APPLICATIONS

In the following, the novel approach, which will also be called
comprehensive approach, is compared to the standard approach,
where the input is estimated from the measurement data before

reaction from X1 to X2 is catalyzed by the input u. This reaction is reversible
with a rate constant k_1. Furthermore, X2 reacts to X3 with rate constants
[<2 and k_2

the model parameters are calibrated. In Section 3.1 the smoothing
parameter A was set to zero for both the standard and the
comprehensive approach. By contrast, for both approaches in
Section 3.2, the smoothing parameter was chosen optimally to
the measured data based on xz-statistics as described in the
Supplementary Information.

3.1 An illustrative model

The ﬁrst application of the new approach is a toy model with three
dynamic states X1,X2 and X3 and one input variable u. As depicted
in Figure 1, the model consists of two reversible reactions where the
ﬁrst forward reaction (X1 —> X2) is catalyzed by a time-dependent
input function u(t). The second forward reaction (X2 —> X3) as well
as both reverse reactions (X3 —> X2 and X2 —> X1) are considered
to be ﬁrst-order mass action kinetics and do not depend on the input
directly.

The ODE system describing the dynamics of the model is given
in the Supplementary Information. The observables are chosen
to be yi=log10(xi) for i: 1,2,3 and y4=log10(u) as for protein
measurement techniques log-normally distributed measurement
uncertainties are assumed (Kreutz et al., 2007).

For the simulation, N = 12 time points between t0 :0 and tend =
50 were chosen with an equidistant sampling. The kinetic rate
constants were set to k1=0.01, k_1 = 1, k2=0.5 and k_2=0.1.
The initial concentrations were chosen close to the steady states, i.e.
x1(0) = 30, x2 (0) = 20 and x3 (0) = 50, as this maximizes the impact
of the input on the variables. For the underlying true input dynamics,
a Gaussian function

_ —2 103 —;<T)2
u(t)_10 +4me (13)
was chosen which has its maximum u(tmax) % 100 at tmax :25.

In order to evaluate the assessment criteria, M 22000 noise
realizations were simulated with a noise level 0X :01 for the
compounds Xi and 0,, 20.3 for the input u(t). A comparison
of several different noise levels is given in the Supplementary
Information. For each noise realization, the parameters were
estimated as described in Section algorithm in the Supplementary
Information.

In Panel A of Figure 2, the model trajectories are plotted for
one noise realization. The identiﬁability of the model parameters
was analyzed by the proﬁle likelihood approach as described in
the Supplementary Information. The likelihood-based conﬁdence
intervals were calculated for multiple conﬁdence levels

ae{0.05,0.1,...,0.95,0.99} (14)

 

to investigate the coverage.

3.1.] Evaluation of the assessment criteria The performance
of the novel approach was challenged by the three assessment
criteria introduced in Section 2.5. In Panel B of Figure 2, the
parameter estimate distributions are shown. In terms of accuracy,
both approaches perform similarly well as the dashed lines indicating
the mean values are not distinguishable. The precision, by contrast,
is increased by a factor of 1.04 up to 1.48 when the novel method
is applied. This can also be seen in the plot where all parameter
distributions in blue are narrower than the green ones. The values
of A and 73 as well as the ratio of these values for both approaches
are given in the Supplementary Information.

Panel C of Figure 2 shows that for all four observables, the
deviation from the estimated to the true trajectory is signiﬁcantly
smaller in case of the comprehensive approach.

In Panel D of Figure 2, the coverage ratio is plotted versus
the conﬁdence level for both approaches. In case of the standard
approach, the measurement uncertainties of the input are not taken
into account. As a consequence, the conﬁdence intervals, at least for
some of the parameters, are too small. This results in a coverage
ratio that is smaller than the corresponding conﬁdence interval
as indicated by the deviation of the green solid line from the
black dashed line in Panel D of Figure 2. Underestimating the
size of a conﬁdence interval can lead to false-positive rejections of
speciﬁc values for the respective parameter and therefore represents
a serious issue. For the comprehensive approach by contrast, the
coverage ratio almost equals the conﬁdence level for all seven
model parameters. According to this, the uncertainty of the input
measurements is appropriately translated into parameter conﬁdence
intervals.

Apparently, the ﬁrst two rate constants k1 and k_1 are affected the
most by the choice of the estimation approach. This results from the
model structure as the ﬂuxes of the ﬁrst reaction X1 :X2 depend
directly on the input. Consistently, the coverage of the rate constants
kg and k_2 of the second reaction X2 :X3 are barely inﬂuenced
by the input and its uncertainties.

3.2 The JAK-STAT signaling pathway

For the second application of the novel approach, a data-based
model of JAK2—STAT5 signaling pathway (Swameye et al., 2003)
was investigated. In this model the downstream system depends
on a measured input. The model structure is depicted in Figure 3.
The ODEs describing the dynamics of the model are given in the
Supplementary Information.

Swameye et al. (2003) performed quantitative immunoblotting
in order to investigate the Epo-induced activation of the J AK2-
STATS signaling pathway. Due to experimental limitations, only
sums of several species were measurable leading to the following
observables:

Y1=Si-(X2+ZX3), Y2=Sz-(X1+X2+ZX3),

37325344,

where y1 is the total amount of phosphorylated STATS in
the cytoplasm, y2 the total amount i.e. unphosphorylated and
phosphorylated STATS in the cytoplasm and y3 is the measurement
of the input function i.e. the amount of the Epo-induced
phosphorylation of EpoR. Furthermore, the immunoblotting method
could only provide relative protein concentrations. Therefore,

scaling parameters s1 to s3 are required and the observables are
given in arbitrary units (au).

In order to calibrate the model to experimental data, a set of
initial conditions for all parameters is needed. First, the initial
concentrations of all phosphorylated model species were set to zero:

[pSTATS](0) —> 0, [pSTAT52](0) —> 0,
[npSTAT52](0) —> 0.

Furthermore, in order to resolve structural identiﬁability issues,
the initial value of STATS and the scaling parameter of the input
were set to one:

[STATS](0) —> 1, s3 —> 1.

Thereby, the forward rate constant k1 is expressed in units of the
input pEpoR and the total amount of STATS, which is conserved in
this system, is set to one. In a second step, a set of initial guesses
for the remaining parameters was selected using Latin hypercube
sampling (LHS). Subsequently, the parameters were estimated by
maximum likelihood estimation.

Panel A of Figure 4 shows the resulting model trajectories and
the corresponding time course data. The model variables, which
correspond to the optimal set of parameters for each approach, are
depicted in Figure S. For the model species STATS, npSTAT52 and
for the input pEpoR, the trajectories differ only sightly. However,
for pSTATS and pSTATSZ, a completely different scale is observed
for both approaches. This results from parameter values of kg and
k3 that differ strongly which will be discussed later on.

The identiﬁability of the model parameters was analyzed by
the proﬁle likelihood approach as described in the Supplementary
Information. The resulting likelihood proﬁles are shown in Panel B
of Figure 4. The corresponding values of the parameter estimates
and their conﬁdence intervals are given in Table 1.

Fig. 3. Schematic representation of the JAK-STAT signaling pathway.
The phosphorylated Erythropoietin receptor (pEpoR) acts as input for the
signaling cascade and induces phosphorylation of STATS. Phosphorylated
STATS (pSTATS) then dimerizes (pSTATSZ) and translocates to the nucleus
(npSTATSZ). There it can act as transcription factor and thereby induce
protein synthesis. Furthermore, with some delay ‘L’, the pSTATS dimers
dissociate to unphosphorylated STATS monomers and translocate back to
the cytoplasm. (Figure adapted from Swameye et al. (2003))

The parameter estimates of the rate constants k1 and k4 can be
directly compared to results of Raue et al. (2009). However, the
point estimates obtained by the standard approach do not exactly
match the previously obtained values. This is due to the choice of
the input representation: in Raue et al. (2009), a smoothing spline of
the input data was used without considering the input uncertainties
for the weighting of the data points and for the determination

Note the different scaling of the left (standard approach) and the right
(comprehensive approach) y-axis for pSTATS and pSTAT52

of the smoothing parameter. In this article by contrast, the input
uncertainties have been estimated from several datasets as described
in the Supplementary Information. This allows for a weighting of the
data according to the ﬁrst term in Equation (7) and for a data-based
selection of the smoothing parameter A. In Raue et al. (2009), the
initial concentration of STATS (x1 (0)) and the scaling parameters
s1 and s2 were structurally non-identiﬁable. In our article, the
parameter value of [STATS](0) was set to one leading to identiﬁable
scaling parameters having different physical units. Therefore, these
parameter values are not comparable with previous results. The
results for the rate constants kg and k3 are discussed later on in
this article.

3.2.] Comparison of the results Here, the results of the standard
approach and the comprehensive approach shall be discussed
and compared. This analysis requires a different strategy than in
Section 3.1 as the underlying truth is not know for this system.

At ﬁrst, it can be observed that the qualitative behavior of the ﬁts
in Panel A of Figure 4 differs between both approaches. The input
observable y3, for instance, has a small plateau at about 25 min
in case of the comprehensively estimated input. This is due to
downstream information, as in the total concentration of pSTATS,
i.e. the observable y1, this plateau is also present with some delay.
Furthermore, for the standard approach, the model trajectories of y1
and y2 deviate signiﬁcantly from the data at the last measurement
time point, i.e. t=60 min. This is due to the input measurement

which has a higher value at the last time point (t = 60 min) than for
the proceeding measurement time points (t = 40, SO min). In contrast,
in case of the comprehensive approach, the experimental data
including the uncertainties of all three observables were considered,
leading to model trajectories that better reﬂect the measured data.

One, at ﬁrst glance, confusing outcome of the model calibration is
the difference in the parameter estimates for kg and k3 as depicted by
the likelihood proﬁles in Panel B of Figure 4. These two parameters
show a completely opposed behavior: for the standard approach,
the process of dimerization, which is described by k2, is faster than
estimated by the comprehensive approach. In contrast, k3, which
describes the translocation of the pSTATS dimers to the nucleus, is
smaller for the standard approach than the estimate resulting from
the comprehensive approach. As a consequence, the trajectories
of the dynamic variables pSTATS and pSTAT52 show a different
scaling for both estimation approaches. Therefore, in Figure S, the
concentrations obtained by the standard approach are indicated by
the y-axis on the left and those of the comprehensive approach by
the right y-axis.

This opposing behavior of kg and k3 was also observed by Raue
et al. (2009), who investigated the variability of the trajectories when
plotting all parameter sets along the likelihood proﬁle that are within
the point-wise 95% conﬁdence interval. This results from the fact
that only the sum of pSTATS and pSTAT52 is measured but not their
individual contribution.

Here, the switching from faster dimerization and slower
translocation to the opposed conﬁguration can be explained in
terms of the Xz-landscape. For the comprehensive approach, a
local minimum can be identiﬁed by LHS, which corresponds to
the situation of the standard approach as depicted in Panels A and
B of Figure 6. Although both minima are in sufﬁcient agreement
with the data because X2 differs by much less than the number of
ﬁtted parameters, the optimal point estimates change. The parameter
values of the minima are given in the Supplementary Information.
However, by optimizing the input in the comprehensive approach,
the xz-landscape changes and another minimum with the switched
parameter conﬁguration becomes optimal.

The selection of a different local minimum in case of
the comprehensive approach also leads to the counterintuitive
observation that the conﬁdence intervals for the parameters k4,
s1 and s2 are larger for the standard approach than for the novel
method.

Hence, the result of the comprehensive approach reveals that an
unambiguous estimation of both rates is not feasible based on the
measured data. Therefore, additional experiments would be required
in order to clarify which parameter conﬁguration corresponds to the
real biological situation.

4 CONCLUSIONS

It has been shown that the presented approach for estimating model
parameters and input comprehensively provides several advantages.
For a toy model with simulated data, the three assessment criteria
deﬁned in Section 2.5 have been evaluated for different noise level
combinations of input and downstream observables. The analysis
revealed that the novel approach outperforms the standard method in
terms of (i) precision, (ii) deviation from the truth and (iii) coverage
of the conﬁdence intervals. The accuracy of the parameter estimates
does not differ signiﬁcantly for both approaches. The performance
is best when the measurement uncertainties of the downstream
observables are smaller than those of the input measurements.

By applying the new method to a model of the J AK—STAT
signaling pathway, it could be shown that also for realistic
experimental studies, one beneﬁts from the comprehensive input
estimation. The optimal model trajectories indicate that downstream
information can be used in order to improve the ﬁt of the input and
vice versa.

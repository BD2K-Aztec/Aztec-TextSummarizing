ABSTRACT

Motivation: Allergenicity, like antigenicity and immunogenicity, is a
property encoded linearly and non-linearly, and therefore the align-
ment-based approaches are not able to identify this property unam-
biguously. A novel alignment-free descriptor-based fingerprint
approach is presented here and applied to identify allergens and
non-allergens. The approach was implemented into a four step algo-
rithm. Initially, the protein sequences are described by amino acid
principal properties as hydrophobicity, size, relative abundance, helix
and ,B-strand forming propensities. Then, the generated strings of
different length are converted into vectors with equal length by auto-
and cross-covariance (ACC). The vectors were transformed into binary
fingerprints and compared in terms of Tanimoto coefficient.

Results: The approach was applied to a set of 2427 known allergens
and 2427 non-allergens and identiﬁed correctly 88% of them with
Matthews correlation coefﬁcient of 0.759. The descriptor fingerprint
approach presented here is universal. It could be applied for any clas-
sification problem in computational biology. The set of E-descriptors is
able to capture the main structural and physicochemical properties of
amino acids building the proteins. The ACC transformation overcomes
the main problem in the alignment-based comparative studies arising
from the different length of the aligned protein sequences. The con-
version of protein ACC values into binary descriptor fingerprints allows
similarity search and classification.

Availability and implementation: The algorithm described in the
present study was implemented in a specially designed Web site,
named AllergenFP (FP stands for FingerPrint). AllergenFP is written
in Python, with GIU in HTML. It is freely accessible at http://ddg-

1 INTRODUCTION

Allergy is a growing health problem of modern life. The preva-
lence of allergic diseases worldwide is rising dramatically in both
developed and developing countries (Pawankar et al., 2011).
Allergy involves a complex series of reactions to external and
internal factors, called allergens, which contribute to the devel-
opment of diseases like rhinitis, asthma, atopic dermatitis and
skin sensitization. Severe reactions as acute and fatal anaphyl-
actic shock also may occur.

An allergic reaction occurs when a susceptible organism is
re—exposed to a speciﬁc allergen. The allergen-speciﬁc Th2 cells

drive the B cells to produce IgE, which binds to mast cells, baso-
phils and activated eosinophils. When the same allergens reenter
the body, they bind to these IgEs and activate the cells to release
stored mediators, which give rise to inﬂammation and tissue
damage (Cooper, 2004; Huby et al., 2000; Rusznak et al., 1998).

Although there is no consensus on the allergen structure, the
United Nations Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) and
the World Health Organization (WHO) have developed guide-
lines for evaluating the potential allergenicity of novel food pro-
teins (FAQ/WHO Agriculture and Consumer Protection, 2001;
FAQ/WHO Codex Alimentarius Commission, 2003). According
to these guidelines, a protein is a potential allergen, if it has either
an identity of 6—8 consecutive amino acids or >35 % sequence
similarity over a window of 80 amino acids when compared with
known allergens (Stadler and Stadler, 2003).

Bioinformatics provides two types of approaches for allergen
prediction. The ﬁrst approach follows FAQ/WHO guidelines
and seeks for sequence similarity. Extensive databases of
known allergens like Structural Database of Allergenic Proteins
(SDAP) (Ivanciuc et al., 2003), Allermatch (Fiers et al., 2004)
and AllerTool (Zhang et al., 2007) are used for similarity
searches. This approach has a good ability to identify allergens,
but also generates a large number of false allergens. Moreover,
the discovery of novel structurally different allergens is limited by
the lack of similarity to known allergens.

The second approach is based on identiﬁcation of patterns for
allergenicity, called motifs. The motif is a combination of amino
acids responsible for a speciﬁc protein activity. Stadler and
Stadler (2003) deﬁned 52 allergen motifs by comparing allergens
and non-allergens using software MEME. Li et al. (2004) used
cluster analysis, wavelet analysis and hidden Markov model pro-
ﬁles to identify allergen motifs. Bjorklund et al. (2005) developed
an Automated Selection of Allergen Representative Peptides
(ARP) protocol. AlgPred is a server for allergen prediction
based on four methods: support vector machines (SVM),
program MEME/MAST, IgE epitopes and ARP (Saha and
Raghava, 2006). Ivanciuc et al. (2009) found that some of the
allergen motifs coincided with IgE epitopes. Motif-generating
algorithms may be used for identifying major IgE binding struc-
tures of coiled-coil proteins (Marti et al., 2009).

Both approaches are sequence based, i.e. they require initial
sets of allergens and non-allergens to be trained. Both
approaches assume that allergenicity is a linearly coded property.
To act as an allergen, a protein should contain epitopes for
both Th-2 and B cells. The Th-2 epitopes are linear, but B—cell
epitopes are conformational patches on the protein surface.
Furmonaviciene et al. (2005) found allergen-speciﬁc conform-
ational epitopes, consisting mainly of hydrophobic residues on

the surface. This ﬁnding is consistent with the fact that the innate
immune system is able to detect hydrophobic parts of immuno-
genic proteins containing aliphatic or aromatic amino acids
(Seong and Matzinger, 2004).

Obviously, allergenicity, like antigenicity and immunogenicity,
is a property encoded linearly and non-linearly, and therefore the
alignment-based approaches are not able to identify this property
unambiguously. In the present study, we describe an alignment-
free method for allergenicity prediction based on amino acid
E—descriptors Wenkatarajan and Braun, 2001) and auto- and
cross-covariance (ACC) transformation of protein sequences
into uniform equal-length vectors (Nystr6m et al., 2000). ACC
was used for quantitative structure—activity relationship (QSAR)
studies of peptides (Nystr6m et al., 2000), protein classiﬁcation
(Lapinsh et al., 2002) and immunogenicity prediction
(Doytchinova and Flower, 2007). Recently, we applied this
method in combination with k nearest neighbors method to
predict allergenicity (Dimitrov et al., 2013). Here, we improve
the method by using a new set of amino acid descriptors and
a novel descriptor ﬁngerprint approach based on Tanimoto
coefﬁcient similarity search (Tanimoto, 1958).

The E—descriptors for the 20 naturally occurring amino acids,
deﬁned by Venkataraj an and Braun (2001), were derived by prin-
cipal component analysis of a data matrix consisting of 237
physicochemical properties. The ﬁrst principal component (E1)
reﬂects the hydrophobicity of amino acids; the second (E2)—
their size; the third (E3)—their helix-forming propensity; the
forth (E0 correlates with the relative abundance of amino
acids; and the ﬁfth (E5) is dominated by the ,6-strand forming
propensity. In the present study, the ﬁve E—descriptors were used
to describe the protein sequences.

The ﬁngerprints in chemoinformatics are developed to de-
scribe the 2D chemical structures (Barnard, 2003; Kochev
et al., 2003; Tomczak, 2003; Willett, 2003). They are generated
in two ways. In the most popular way, the structure of a com-
pound is divided into substructural fragments and assembled
into a binary string—if the fragment exists in the structure the
corresponding string element takes 1, otherwise, it takes 0.
Binary structural ﬁngerprints are especially useful, as there are
highly efﬁcient in computer algorithms working with binary
strings. Daylight has developed another approach (http://www.
daylight.com/dayhtml/doc/theory/theory.ﬁnger.html). The
Daylight ﬁngerprints are generated as patterns from the envir-
onment of each atom (up to seven atoms away). Each pattern
serves as a seed to a pseudo-random number generator (it
is ‘hashed’), the output of which is a set of bits (typically 4 or
5 bits per pattern); the set of bits is added (with a logical OR)
to the ﬁngerprint.

Here, we present a novel descriptor-based ﬁngerprint
approach. The ﬁngerprint consists of descriptors instead of struc-
tural fragments. This enlarges the area of ﬁngerprint application
outside the chemical structure description, even outside chemis-
try. Moreover, it allows physical and/or biological information
to be included in the similarity search process. Obviously, the
basic problem here is, as in other quantitative structure—activity
relationship methods, the selection of proper descriptors. They
could be discrete, i.e. Boolean values, e. g. the presence or absence
of given physical, chemical and/or biological features. The
ﬁngerprint is binary coded—when the given feature presents,

the ﬁngerprint takes 1 at the proper position, otherwise, it
equals 0. Many descriptors have continuous values, e.g. a nuclear
magnetic resonance or infrared spectra, logP, quantum chemis-
try-based descriptors and so forth. These descriptors also could
be converted into discrete values by scaling and dividing into
intervals with regular size. If a descriptor value falls within an
interval, the corresponding ﬁngerprint element takes 1; other-
wise, it takes 0. Obviously, the length of the ﬁngerprint depends
on the number of intervals: as many they are, as longer is the
ﬁngerprint. The longer ﬁngerprints are able to capture more
molecular features than the shorter ones but in the same time
are redundant in information. A balance between ﬁngerprint
length and information content should be found in any particu-
lar study.

2 DATASETS AND METHODS
2.1 Protein datasets

2.1.1 Allergens An initial allergen dataset was collected from
the CSL (Central Science Laboratory) allergen database (http://
allergen.csl.gov.uk), the FARRP (Food Allergen Research
and Resource Program) allergen database (http://www.
allergenonline.org), SDAP (Structural Database of Allergenic
Proteins) (http://fermi.utmb.edu/SDAP/sdap_man.html) and
Allergome database (http://www.allergome.org/). The allergen
proteins were searched in Swiss-Prot database (http://www.
uniprot.org) and only sequences with ‘evidence for the exist-
ence of protein-evidence at protein level’ were selected.
Duplicates were removed. The ﬁnal set of allergens contained
2427 proteins.

2.1.2 Non-allergens A set of proteins from species Solanum
lycopersicum (tomato), Capsicum annuum (pepper), Solanum
tuberosum (potato), T riticum aestz'vum (bread wheat) and Oryza
sativa (Asian rice) and Oryza glaberrima (African rice) was col-
lected after search in Swiss-Prot for proteins with ‘evidence for
the existence of protein-evidence at protein level’ and exclusion
of proteins containing the key word ‘allergen’ in their descrip-
tion. The resulting set consisted of 950 non-allergens.
Additionally, a set of non-allergens was collected from Swiss-
Prot to include proteins from Homo sapiens species with
‘evidence for the existence of protein-evidence at protein level’.
The proteins with key words ‘allergen’ and ‘cancer’ in their
description as well as proteins with unidentiﬁed amino acids in
their sequences were excluded. The ﬁnal set of non-allergens
contained 2427 proteins.

The set of allergens and non-allergens used in the present study
is freely accessible from AllergenFP Web site. This set could be
used as a uniform reference set in future studies on allergenicity
prediction as it is manually curated and contains known allergens
with evidence at protein level.

2.2 Presentation of protein sequences by E—descriptors and
ACC transformation

The values for the ﬁve E—descriptors used in the present study to
describe the protein sequences are given in Table 1. To make the
length of the proteins uniform, an auto- and cross-cross covari-
ance (ACC) transformation was used (Nystrém et al., 2000).

Indices j and k refer to the E—descriptors (i = 1-5, k = 1-5, j 75 k), rt
is the number of amino acids in a sequence, index i points the
amino acid position (i: 1, 2, . . . , rt) and L is the lag (L: 1, 2, . . .,
L). Short lags (L: 5 + 20) were chosen, as only the inﬂuence of
close amino acid proximity was investigated. A177 L ) and Cjk( L )
values were assigned further in the article as ACC values. The
subsets of allergens and non-allergens were transformed into
matrices with 25 x L variables (52 x L) each.

2.3 Descriptor ﬁngerprints approach based on Tanimoto
coefﬁcient similarity search

In the present study, ACC-based descriptor ﬁngerprints were gen-
erated. The 25 x L ACC descriptors were scaled by a factor of
100, divided into K intervals each and converted into 25 x L x K-
digit binary ﬁngerprints. A digit in the ﬁngerprint equals 1, if the
ACC value falls into the corresponding interval, otherwise,
it takes 0. Thus, each protein has a unique binary ﬁngerprint
consisting of 25 x L units and (25 x L x K—25 x L) nulls.

The ﬁngerprints for each pair proteins were compared accord-
ing to Tanimoto coefﬁcient:

NC

TAB:—
(3) NA+NB—NC

where N A and N B are the number of digits in the ﬁngerprints of
structure A and structure B, respectively, and N C is the number
of common digits between them. Tanimoto coefﬁcient takes
value between 0 and 1. The larger is the value, the more similar
are the two structures. Thus, two structures with Tanimoto
coefﬁcient T: 0.98 are much more similar than two structures
with Tanimoto coefﬁcient T: 0.56.

2.4 Evaluation of performance

The method for allergenicity prediction developed in the present
study was evaluated by leave-one-out cross-validation (LOO-
CV) and by 10-fold cross-validation (10-fold-CV). In the LOO-
CV procedure, each protein was excluded from the dataset and
compared with the remaining 11-] proteins by Tanimoto coefﬁ-
cient. The protein with the highest value for T ( A,B ) determined
the class identity of the tested protein (allergen or non-allergen).
In the 10—fold-CV procedure, the whole set is divided into
10 groups. Each group was treated as a test set, the remaining
nine as a training set.

The correctly predicted allergens and non-allergens were
deﬁned as true positives (TP) and true negatives (TN), respect-
ively. The incorrectly predicted allergens and non-allergens were
deﬁned as false negatives (FN) and false positives (FP), respect-
ively. Sensitivity [TP/(TP+FN)], specificity [FP/(TN+FP)],
positive predictive value (ppv) [TP/(TP+FP)], F1 score [2*sensi—
tivity*ppv/(sensitivity +ppv)] and Matthews correlation coefficient
(MCC) [(TP x TN — FP x FN)/((TP + FP)(TP + FN)(TN + FP)
(TN+ F N))1/2] were calculated. For the 10—fold-CV, average
values of the 10 runs were given.

2.5 Web servers for allergenicity prediction

The method developed in the present study was compared to
ﬁve servers for allergenicity prediction freely available in the
web. These were AllerHunter, AlgPred, APPEL, ProAp and
AllerTOP.

AllerHunter (http://tiger.dbs.nus.edu.sg/AllerHunter) is a
cross-reactive allergen prediction program built on a combin-
ation of SVM and pairwise sequence similarity (Zorzet et al.,
2002). Each proteins sequence in the training set is vectorized
by performing sequence alignment and Basic Local Alignment
Search Tool (BLAST) against all other members of the training
set. The protein sequences are represented as vectors consisted of
similarity scores for each pair of proteins in the training set.

AlgPred (http://imtech.res.in/raghava/algpred) predicts aller-
gens by applying four different methods: MEME/MAST motif
search, SVM-based classiﬁcation of allergens and non-allergens
by single amino acid composition [AlgPred(SVM_single_aa)]
and by dipeptide composition [AlgPred(SVM_dipeptide), and
BLAST search against allergen representative peptides
(AlgPred(ARP)]. MEME is a tool for discovering motifs in a
group of related protein sequences. MAST searches in biological
sequence databases for sequences that contain one or more
groups of known motifs. Single amino acid composition gives
the fraction of each amino acid in a protein. Dipeptide compos-
ition is used to encapsulate the global information about each
protein sequence and gives a ﬁxed pattern length of 400
(20 x 20). The BLAST search is performed against a set contain-
ing 24 amino acid long peptides, so-called ARP, and ﬁnds

proteins with high similarity to allergenic proteins (Saha and
Raghava, 2006).

The APPEL tool (Allergen Protein Prediction E-Lab) (http://
jing.cz3. nus. edu.sg/cgi-bin/APPEL) uses SVM to identify novel
allergen proteins from the sequence-derived structural and
physicochemical properties of a whole protein (Cui et al.,
2007). It is based on a statistical method and has the potential
to discover novel allergen proteins.

ProAp (http://gmobl.sjtu.edu.cn/proAP/main.html) is a web-
based application that integrates and optimizes sequence-based,
motif-based [ProAp(motif)] and SVM-based [ProAp(SVM)]
allergen prediction approaches for determination of cross-
reactivities between potential allergens and known allergens
WVang et al., 2013). The applied SVM method takes amino
acid composition as protein features.

AllerTOP (http://www.pharmfac.net/allertop) is the ﬁrst align-
ment-free server for in silico prediction of allergens based on the
main physicochemical properties of proteins (Dimitrov et al.,
2013). AllerTOP uses a model based on amino acid z-descriptors,
ACC protein transformation and k nearest neighbors clustering.
The protein sequences are uploaded in plain format. The results
page returns the allergen status: ‘Probable Allergen’ or ‘Probable
Non-allergen’. It also returns the k nearest neighbours in the
training set. On this basis, AllerTOP deﬁnes the most probable
route of exposure of tested proteins predicted as an allergen:
food, inhalant or toxin.

3 ALGORITHM

The algorithm used in the present study is described in Figure 1.
Initially, the amino acids in the protein sequences were described
by the ﬁve E—descriptors and the strings were transformed
into uniform vectors by ACC. The derived matrix consisted of
4854 rows (2427 allergens and 2427 non-allergens) and 25 x L
columns. Each column was divided into K intervals and a
25 x L x K-digit binary ﬁngerprint was generated for each pro-
tein. A digit in the ﬁngerprint equals 1, if the ACC value falls
into the corresponding interval, otherwise, it takes 0. Thus, each
protein has a unique binary ﬁngerprint consisted of 25 x L units
and (25 x L x K—25 x L) nulls. Tanimoto coefﬁcients were calcu-
lated for all protein pairs in the set. A protein was classiﬁed as
allergen or non-allergen according to the protein from the pair
with the highest Tanimoto coefﬁcient.

The algorithm was optimized in terms of lag length lchanging
L from 5 to 20 with step of 5. The performances were compared
by sensitivity, specificity, accuracy, ppv and F1 value (Fig. 2).
Sensitivity initially decreases with increasing of L, reaches min-
imum at L = 10, then increases, reaches maximum at L = 15 and
again decreases. Specificity, accuracy, ppv and F1 increase grad-
ually, reach maximum at L = 15 and then decrease. Thus, L = 15
was chosen as an optimum value.

The ACC values range from —10 to +11. Each ACC was
divided into K regular intervals. Short intervals generate long
ﬁngerprints requiring long time for calculation. Longer ﬁnger-
prints capture more structural information. Some of this infor-
mation brings more ‘noise’ than ‘signal’. A balance between
ﬁngerprint length and information content should be found in
any particular study. In the present study, the optimal number of
regular intervals was found by changing the resolution step and

units (25 x15) and 3750 nulls (25 x15x11 — 25 x15). The
LOO-CV tests gave 87% sensitivity, 89% specificity, 88% accur-
acy, 89% ppv, F] :0.88 and MCC: 0.76. The 10—fold-CV tests
gave slightly lower predictions: 85% sensitivity, 85% specificity,
85% accuracy, 85% ppv, F] :0.85 and MCC:0.70.

4 IMPLEMENTATION

The algorithm described in the present study was implemented in
a specially designed Web site, named AllergenF P (FP stands for
FingerPrint). AllergenFP is written in Python, with GIU in
HTML. It is freely accessible at http://ddg—pharmfac.net/
AllergenF P. Single protein sequence is uploaded in plain
format. The results page returns the predicted protein status:
‘Probable Allergen’ or ‘Probable Non-allergen’. It also returns
the protein from the pair with the highest value of Tanimoto
coefﬁcient.

5 COMPARISON WITH EXISTING METHODS FOR
ALLERGEN PREDICTION

AllergenF P was compared to ﬁve freely available web servers for
allergenicity prediction. The set of known allergens and non-
allergens compiled in the present study was used to test the ser-
vers. The results are given in Table 2.

ProAp(motif) showed the highest sensitivity. It recognized
94% of the allergens in the set, followed by AlgPred(SVM_sin—
gle_aa) (89%) and AllerTOP (88 %). The highest specificity
belongs to AllerHunter. It recognized 96% of the non-allergens,
closely followed by AlgPred(ARP) (95%) and APPEL (91%).
AllergenF P is the most accurate predictor identifying 88% of
both allergens and non-allergens. Close to it is AllerHunter
with 87% accuracy. The parameter ppv accounts for the fraction
of TP among all predicted positives. Ninety-ﬁve percent of the
predicted allergens by AllerHunter are true allergens. Next to it is
AlgPred(ARP) with 94% ppv. F1 is a weighted average of sensi-
tivity and ppv. AllergenFP has the highest value for F1 (0.878),
followed by AllerHunter (0.858). By deﬁnition, M CC is a correl-
ation coefﬁcient between the observed and predicted binary
classiﬁcations. AllergenFP showed the highest M CC (0.759)
closely followed by AllerHunter (0.754).

6 DISCUSSION

Allergenicity of food proteins is a crucial problem associated
with the widespread usage of new foods, supplements and
herbs, many of them having known or unknown genetically
modiﬁed origin. Allergenicity is a subtle non—linearly—coded
property. Most of the existing methods for allergenicity predic-
tion are based on structural similarity of novel proteins to known
allergens. Thus, the identiﬁcation of a novel structurally diverse
allergen could not be predicted by these methods.

In the present study, we propose an alignment-free method for
allergenicity prediction, based on amino acid principal properties
as hydrophobicity, size, relative abundance, helix and ,6-strand
forming propensities. Proteins are transformed into descriptor-
based ﬁngerprints and compared by Tanimoto coefﬁcient. The
algorithm was optimized in terms of lag length and resolution
step and cross-validated by a set of 2427 known allergens and
2427 non-allergens. It recognized 87% of the allergens and 89%
of the non-allergens. The algorithm and the set of proteins used
in the study were implemented in a specially designed Web site,
named AllergenFP and freely accessible at http://ddg—pharmfac.
net/AllergenF P. AllergenFP was compared with ﬁve freely
available web servers for allergenicity prediction and showed
the highest predictive ability.

For example, recently Liao et al. (2013) identiﬁed a novel
allergenic protein Tyr p 8 from T yrophagus putrescentiae that
cross-reacts with Der p 8 from Dermatophagoides pteronyssinus.
Both proteins are not available in our database. AllergenF P
identiﬁes them as allergens with T: 0.84.

The descriptor ﬁngerprint approach based on Tanimoto coef-
ﬁcient similarity search used in the present study to discriminate
between allergens and non-allergens is universal. It could be
applied for any classiﬁcation problem in computational biology.
The set of E—descriptors is able to capture the main structural
and physicochemical properties of amino acids. The ACC trans-
formation overcomes the main problem in the alignment-based
comparative studies arising from the different length of the
aligned protein sequences. The conversion of protein ACC
values into a binary descriptor ﬁngerprint is a computational
novelty, described here for the ﬁrst time.

AllergenFP

 

The comparison between the freely available servers for aller-
genicity prediction showed that most of them performed well and
gave reliable predictions. Some of them, like ProAp(motif),
AlgPred(SVM_single_aa) and AllerTOP, identify allergens
better than non-allergens. Others, like AlgPred(ARP) and
APPEL, are good in identifying non-allergens. Only
AllergenFP and AllerHunter gave balanced predictions of both
allergens and non-allergens. Furthermore, AllergenF P showed
the best performance in terms of F1 and M CC.

1 INTRODUCTION

Genome—scale, in silico metabolic models provide powerful tools
for studying the capacity, function and dynamics of microbial
metabolism. Speciﬁcally, network—based models have been shown
to capture essential features of microbial metabolism revealed
through careful analysis of their structure and topology (Alon, 2003).
Such topology—based analysis has been used to characterize various
functional and evolutionary properties including scaling (Jeong
et al., 2000), modularity (Guimera and Amaral, 2005), essentiality
(Palumbo et al., 2005), transcriptional regulation of metabolism
(Patil and Nielsen, 2005) and adaptation (Kreimer et al., 2008).

However, as organisms evolve and adapt to their environments,
the structure of their metabolic networks clearly contains
information not only about their metabolic capacity but also about
their habitat. The topology of the metabolic network of an organism
can therefore be used to characterize its environment and to obtain
insights into its ecology. This ‘Reverse Ecology’ approach was
introduced by Borenstein et al. (2008), who proposed an algorithm
for analyzing the topology of metabolic networks of microbial
species and predicting the set of nutrients they acquire from
the environment (termed ‘seed set’). This framework allows for
the quantiﬁcation of an organism’s metabolic dependence on its
environment and enables the transformation of high—throughput
genomic data into large—scale ecological data.

Formally, the seed set of a directed network, such as a metabolic
network, is deﬁned as the minimal subset of nodes necessary
to access every other node in the network. Accordingly, for a
metabolic network, the seed set corresponds to the minimal subset
of the compounds in the network that cannot be synthesized from
other compounds in the network and whose existence permits the

production of all other compounds in the network. These seed
metabolites therefore represent externally acquired compounds and
can be Viewed as the metabolic interface between an organism
and its environment. Borenstein et al. (2008) validated these
inferred metabolic environments and demonstrated that they serve
as successful proxies for organisms’ biochemical environments and
capture information about their habitats. They further used this
approach to study the evolution of the interface between organisms
and their environments across the microbial tree of life and identiﬁed
various determinants of this interface.

The seed set analysis technique has since been used in
several computational studies to elucidate microbial metabolism
and ecology. Speciﬁcally, this approach has been applied to
quantitatively characterize the ecological strategies of a large array
of microbial species (Freilich et al., 2009), to quantify environmental
robustness in bacteria (Freilich et al., 2010a) and to calculate the
metabolic overlap between organisms in microbial communities
(Freilich et al., 2010b). Cottret et al. (2010) implemented the seed
detection algorithm to study the metabolic relationship between
coresident endocytobionts. Borenstein and Feldman (2009) further
extended the seed set concept to predict the interaction between
host and parasites on a large scale. The concept of the seed set
has also been proposed as a biotechnology and environmental
engineering framework for developing media to isolate speciﬁc
microorganisms (Roling et al., 2010) and for predicting potential
syntrophic relationships and selecting taxa for gnotobiotic mice
colonization studies (Hansen et al., 2011). J anga and Babu (2008)
further promoted the use of the seed set framework for studying the
association of species in similar habitats and for developing drugs
to target parasitic organisms without harming the host.

As the number of available genome—scale metabolic models is
steadily increasing, laying the foundation for extensive reverse—
ecology studies (Papp et al., 2011), we have developed NetSeed,
a web—based tool to calculate and Visualize metabolic network
seed sets. NetSeed will make the calculation of the seed sets
of metabolic networks simple and widely available. NetSeed
is available online with additional documentation and examples
at http://depts.washington.edu/elbogs/NetSeed. NetSeed is also
available as an open—source (GPL) Perl module, allowing the seed
detection algorithm to be included in custom software.

2 DESIGN AND IMPLEMENTATION

NetSeed determines the seed set of a metabolic network as described
in Borenstein et al. (2008). Here, the network is represented as

a directed graph, with nodes as metabolites and edges as reactions
linking substrates to products. The seed set of the network is
calculated in two steps. First, the network is decomposed into its
strongly connected components (SCCs) using Kosaraju’s algorithm
(Aho et al., 1974). SCCs of a directed network are deﬁned as
maximal subsets of the network where there exists a path from each
node to every other node in the subset. Due to this interconnectivity,
SCCs have the property that either all or none of their nodes are
potential seeds. The second step then determines which SCCs are
sources, having no incoming edges. The nodes in these source SCCs
are the potential candidates of the seed set of the network. Seed
candidates that belong to the same SCC (seed group) have the
property that the presence of one in the seed set will generate all the
other in the group and therefore cannot be distinguished in terms
of their seed status. To quantify this relationship, each seed in the
network is given a ‘conﬁdence level’ corresponding to the inverse
of the size of their seed group. See Borenstein et al. (2008) for more
details.

The NetSeed web tool (Fig. 1A) is a Perl CGI built on top of
the NetSeed Perl module, which performs the seed set calculation.
The user ﬁrst selects a network (several formats are supported) and

determines whether to restrict the calculation by component size
(e.g. only the giant component or those of a minimum size) and
whether to view the seeds in Cytoscape Web (Lopes et al., 2010).
If Cytoscape Web is enabled, the user may specify the minimum
conﬁdence level for labeling seeds; this will not affect the analysis.

When user then selects ‘Analyze Network’, the network ﬁle is
uploaded and the seed set calculated. The results page (Fig. 1B)
displays statistics on the analysis and links to ﬁles containing a list
of seeds with their conﬁdence levels, seed groups, nodes ignored
by the calculation (as speciﬁed by the user) and non—seed nodes.
If requested, the network is rendered in Cytoscape Web with the
highlighted seed set. If the node names correspond to KEGG IDs,
links to the KEGG database are generated. Detailed examples and
an in—depth manual for both the NetSeed web tool and Perl module
are available on the NetSeed website.

ABSTRACT

Summary: While many tools exist for performing enrichment
analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic data in order to interpret
them in biological terms, almost no equivalent tools exist for
metabolomic data. We present Metabolite Biological Role (MBRole),
a web server for carrying out over-representation analysis of
biological and chemical annotations in arbitrary sets of metabolites
(small chemical compounds) coming from metabolomic data of any
organism or sample.

Availability and Implementation: The web server is freely available
at http://csbg.cnb.csic.es/mbrole. It was tested in the main web
browsers.

1 INTRODUCTION

In general, -0mics data require a secondary analysis in order to
be understood in biological terms. In the case of transcriptomics,
for example, the primary processing of the raw experimental data
provides large lists of hundreds or thousands of genes which are
over— or under—expressed in a given condition. These lists are not
easily interpretable and they should be further processed in order to
get insight into the underlying cause for that change in expression.
The most widely used methodology for performing such analysis
is termed ‘functional enrichment’ (Khatri and Draghici, 2005). This
analysis looks for keywords or descriptors over—represented in the
set of genes of interest (e.g. those over—expressed) with respect to
a background reference set (e. g. the whole genome or the set of
genes printed in the array). Since originally proposed, a hundred
of variations and different implementations of enrichment analysis
have been proposed (Huang da et al., 2009).

While transcriptomic techniques provide information on the
mRNA concentrations of the gene repertory of an organism, and
proteomics on the respective protein concentrations, metabolomic
techniques aim to massively measure the concentrations of the whole
metabolite repertory of a given cell (Hollywood et al., 2006). Hence,
these methodologies complement each other in providing global
pictures of the molecular components of living systems. Newer
than transcriptomics and proteomics, metabolomic techniques are
still facing many technical problems. Maybe due to this, the
number of tools for performing secondary analysis (i.e. biological
interpretation) of metabolomic data is still scarce, e. g. MetExplore
(Cottret et al., 2010). As far as we know, only one public tool

exists for performing functional enrichment analysis in metabolomic
data: MSEA (Xia and Wishart, 2010). That pioneering piece of
work has a number of additional interesting features, such as the
possibility of using quantitative data (metabolite concentrations).
However, that tool is so far restricted to human metabolism.
Nevertheless, there exist metabolic databases with multi—organism
metabolite annotations whose potential is so far being unexploited
for performing this kind of analysis.

With the aim to provide a wide support for analyzing
general metabolomic data we have developed MBRole (Metabolite
Biological Role). MBRole works with a large number of biological
and chemical annotations from the main publicly available
metabolite databases and is accessible through a simple and intuitive
web interface.

2 METABOLITE ANNOTATIONS

MBRole performs enrichment analysis of a number of annotations
of diverse nature coming from different databases. From KEGG
(Kanehisa and Goto, 2000) metabolites are annotated with their
associated pathways, enzymes and chemical groups, as well as other
interactions. From HMDB (Wishart et al., 2007), the annotations
on pathways, taxonomy, diseases, tissues, bioﬂuids and cellular
localizations are gathered. The annotations on pharmacological
action are taken from PubChem (pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov). From
ChEBI (Degtyarenko et al., 2008), we took the annotations on
biological roles, chemical roles and application. Apart from these
annotations more related to the biological role of the compounds, the
system also uses purely chemical annotations such as the chemical
taxonomy of HMDB and the chemical groups detected by the
Checkmol software (Heider, 2010).

3 FUNCTIONALITY AND INTERFACE

The main input provided by the user is the set of compounds of
interest (e. g. those with signiﬁcant concentration changes in a given
condition). These can be given as identiﬁers (IDs) of any of the
databases mentioned early or as simpliﬁed molecular input line entry
system (SMILES) strings (www.daylight.com). In the last case, the
analysis can be done with purely chemical annotations only. The
interface includes a conversion utility which allows the user to
perform the analysis using the annotations of a given database even
if the IDs are from another database. This conversion utility also
accepts CAS registry numbers and metabolite common names.
Additionally, the user has to select the set(s) of annotations
(keywords) and the background set of compounds for performing
the enrichment analysis (Fig. la). The analysis can be performed
simultaneously in more than one set of annotations. Annotations

for the input set are statistically assessed against the background
set. For those databases associating taxonomic information to
the compounds (currently only KEGG), the user can select as
background set the compounds present in (i.e. metabolized by)
his/her organism of interest. For the rest, the background set is
the full set of compounds with annotations on each database.
Alternatively, the user can provide an arbitrary background set (as a
list of compound identiﬁers). In the case of SMILES the background
set must be necessarily provided by the user.

Over—representation analysis is computed using the cumulative
hypergeometric distribution. Multiple testing is corrected using the
false discovery rate (FDR) (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

The results page (Fig. lb) contains the list of annotations over—
represented in the input set with respect to the background set
and their associated P—values. The results for the different sets of
annotations selected in the previous step can be accessed on the left
column. These list(s) of annotations can be directly exported to a
spreadsheet program (as .csv comma— separated ﬁles) or interactively
analyzed. In the interactive list, annotations are hyperlinked to the
corresponding databases (when possible). In the case of KEGG
pathways, the compounds in the input set are highlighted in the
pathway representation. There is a checkbox to include in the table
the IDs of the compounds associated to each annotation. These
compounds are also hyperlinked to the corresponding database, and
their molecular structures (if available in that particular database)
are shown when the mouse is over them (Fig. lb).

The web server includes a help page, a guided tutorial and some
pre—computed examples.

4 CONCLUSION

In this work we present MBRole, a tool to perform functional
enrichment analysis on metabolic data from any organism or
sample using sets of annotations of diverse nature. Only very
recently the ﬁrst tool for performing metabolomic enrichment
analysis appeared: MSEA (Xia and Wishart, 2010), which is

restricted to human metabolites. Although focused on qualitative
annotations, MBRole is general and versatile enough to perform
functional enrichment analysis in any metabolomic sample
(including additional biological and chemical annotations for human
metabolites), and hence complements existing software for the rising
ﬁeld of metabolomics.

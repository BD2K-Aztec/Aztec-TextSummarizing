ABSTRACT

Motivation: The increasing availability of mitochondria-targeted and
off-target sequencing data in whole-exome and whole-genome
sequencing studies (WXS and WGS) has risen the demand of effective
pipelines to accurately measure heteroplasmy and to easily recognize
the most functionally important mitochondrial variants among a huge
number of candidates. To this purpose, we developed MToolBox, a
highly automated pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mito-
chondrial DNA from high-throughput sequencing data.

Results: MToolBox implements an effective computational strategy
for mitochondrial genomes assembling and haplogroup assignment
also including a prioritization analysis of detected variants.
MToolBox provides a Variant Call Format file featuring, for the first
time, allele-specific heteroplasmy and annotation files with prioritized
variants. MToolBox was tested on simulated samples and applied on
1000 Genomes WXS datasets.

Availability and implementation: MToolBox package is available at
https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtoolbox/.

1 INTRODUCTION

Emerging discoveries in human mitochondrial genetics, driven by
the advent of next-generation sequencing, have revealed that in-
dividuals exhibit a complex mixture of mitochondrial genotypes
(He et al., 2010) and carry low-level heteroplasmic variants
(Payne et al., 2013). On the other hand, the deeper the sequen-
cing coverage, the higher the number of mitochondrial DNA

(mtDNA) variants and the variety of heteroplasmic ranges
found per individual (Diroma et al., 2014; He et al., 2010;
Payne et al., 2013). In this frame, the deep sequencing of
mtDNA raises the demand of effective pipelines to accurately
measure heteroplasmy and to easily recognize the most function-
ally important variants among a huge number of candidates. To
this purpose, we developed MToolBox, a highly automated bio-
informatics pipeline to reconstruct and analyze human mtDNA
from high-throughput sequencing (HTS) data. The MToolBox
workﬁow includes a computational strategy to assemble mito-
chondrial genomes from whole-exome sequencing (WXS) and/or
whole-genome sequencing WVGS) data (Picardi and Pesole,
2012), which was further updated to detect insertions and dele-
tions (ins/dels) and to assess the heteroplasmic fraction (HF) of
each variant allele with the related conﬁdence interval (CI),
reported as sample-speciﬁc meta-information in an enhanced
version of the Variant Call Format WCF) ﬁle (version 4.0).
The MToolBox pipeline analyzes the reconstructed genomes
for haplogroup assignment (Rubino et al., 2012) and variant
prioritization.

2 METHODS

2.1 Mitochondrial reads extraction, genome
reconstruction and VCF ﬁle generation

The MToolBox pipeline integrates in a unique automatic workﬂow a
computational strategy for mtDNA data extraction from WXS and
WGS data (Picardi and Pesole, 2012), where new important features
have been added. MToolBox can accept as input raw data or prealigned
reads (Fig. 1a). In both cases, reads are mapped/remapped by the
mapExome.py script (Fig. 1b) at user’s choice either onto the
Reconstructed Sapiens Reference Sequence (RSRS; Behar et al., 2012)
or the revised Cambridge Reference Sequence (rCRS; Andrews et al.,
1999). Subsequently, reads mapped on mtDNA are realigned onto the
nuclear genome (GRCh37/hg19), to discard Nuclear mitochondrial
Sequences (NumtS; Simone et al., 2011; Fig. lo) and ampliﬁcation
artifacts. The resulting Sequence Alignment/Map (SAM) ﬁle (Fig. 1d)
can be optionally processed for ins/dels realignment around a set of

known ins/dels, annotated in HmtDB (Rubino et al., 2012) and
MITOMAP (Ruiz-Pesini et al., 2007), and for putative PCR duplicates
removal (Fig. le—h and Supplementary Information). This step generates
a dataset of highly reliable mitochondrial aligned reads, which is used to
reconstruct a complete mitochondrial genome by the
assembleMTgenome.py script (Fig. 1i), now integrating the
mtVariantCaller.py module for nucleotide mismatches and ins/dels detec-
tion. All the genomic variants are ﬁltered based on the quality scores and
read depth, and annotated in a VCF ﬁle (v.4.0), with the corresponding
HF and CI values (Fig. 1 j and Supplementary Information).

2.2 Haplogroup prediction and prioritization analysis of
mitochondrial variants

MToolBox provides an output ﬁle with reconstructed contig sequence(s)
(Contigsfa) (Fig. 1k and Supplementary Information). Each set of con-
tigs is subjected to haplogroup prediction, relying on the RSRS-based
Phylotree resource (van Oven and Kayser, 2009), by mt-classifier (Fig. 11),
an updated version of the fragment-classify tool (Rubino et al., 2012),
which now includes a module to perform functional annotation and pri-
oritization of mitochondrial variants (Fig. 1m and Supplementary
Information). This latter analysis is carried out by aligning each
sample-speciﬁc reconstructed contig against the related macro-
haplogroup-speciﬁc consensus sequence (Supplementary Information)
to recognize, via a prioritization process, private variants, deserving fur-
ther clinical investigation. The prioritization takes into account also the
pathogenicity of each mutated allele, determined with different algo-
rithms, and the nucleotide variability of each variant site; amino acid
variability is also considered if the variant site is codogenic
(Supplementary Information). For each mutated allele, additional anno-
tations are also reported, i.e. annotation from HmtDB and MITOMAP
resources and their occurrence among 1000 Genomes Project samples
(Supplementary Information). Variants of assembled genomes are also
reported with respect to rCRS (Supplementary Information), to ensure a

full compatibility of the resulting annotation with the current clinical
literature (Bandelt et al., 2014).

3 RESULTS

The MToolBox performance in heteroplasmy detection was
tested on four artiﬁcial heteroplasmic samples, whose sequencing
was simulated at different mean depth (Supplementary
Information). MToolBox showed high speciﬁcity and sensitivity
in detecting all the artiﬁcial heteroplasmy tested, with an average
coverage depth equal or above 1000x. MToolBox was exten-
sively applied on WXS data from 1000 Genomes (Genomes
Project et al., 2012 and Supplementary Information), to obtain
a VCF ﬁle of mtDNA variants from 2419 individuals (available
at https://sourceforge.net/projects/mtoolbox/ﬁles/1000Genomes_
data/). Reliability of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes was
conﬁrmed by their haplogroup predictions, the majority of which
coherent with the ancestry of the related individual
(Supplementary Information). The accuracy in heteroplasmy de-
tection and quantiﬁcation was conﬁrmed by the results from
four mother—child pairs that showed the expected pattern of
mtDNA inheritance (Supplementary Information).

4 DISCUSSION

A highly automated pipeline for mtDNA analysis from HTS
data is not available to date. To ﬁll this gap, we developed
MToolBox, an effective workﬂow with customizable parameters
and able to analyze multiple samples in a single run. MToolBox
is the only tool that generates as output a VCF ﬁle, the standard
format for large-scale genotyping information, suitably custo-
mized for mitochondrial data, by including the heteroplasmy
fraction and its related CI. In fact, also the MitoSeek tool
(Guo et al., 2013) performs mitochondrial HTS data ana-
lyses, including somatic and structural variant recognition.
Additionally, MToolBox provides the user with essential ana-
lyses of reconstructed mitochondrial genomes, i.e. haplogroup
assignment and variant prioritization, exploiting a broad collec-
tion of annotation resources. Thus, MToolBox may provide a
valuable support for the recognition of candidate mitochondrial
mutations in clinical studies.

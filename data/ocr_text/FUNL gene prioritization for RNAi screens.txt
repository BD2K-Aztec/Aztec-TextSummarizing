Abstract

Motivation: Most biological processes remain only partially characterized with many components
still to be identified. Given that a whole genome can usually not be tested in a functional assay,
identifying the genes most likely to be of interest is of critical importance to avoid wasting
resources.

Results: Given a set of known functionally related genes and using a state—of—the—art approach to
data integration and mining, our Functional Lists (FUN—L) method provides a ranked list of candi—
date genes for testing. Validation of predictions from FUN—L with independent RNAi screens con—
firms that FUN—L—produced lists are enriched in genes with the expected phenotypes. In this article,
we describe a website front end to FUN—L.

Availability and implementation: The website is freely available to use at http://funl.org

1 Introduction

 

An ever increasing volume of biological data provides insights into
cellular biological processes. However, how best to leverage the
data to generate experimentally testable hypotheses is an open issue.
A case in point is RNAi screening where assay complexity, cost and
available resources can limit capacity to conduct a large screen.
When an exhaustive discovery of all genes involved in a biological
process is not required, genome-wide screens are not necessary and
a screen focused on candidate genes should be preferred. A key to
the success of such screens resides in selecting genes with a
high probability of being involved in the desired biological process.

With the large amount and diversity of information now available,
finding likely candidates has become non—trivial. Currently target
selection for experiments is typically guided by experimentalists
selecting a few candidates after manual database searches and exten—
sively trawling the literature. This manual approach has the advan—
tage of the experimentalists’ ability to filter the quality of the data.
However, this risks ignoring relevant experimental data provided by
indirect evidence and from high—throughput experiments. Therefore,
we developed Functional Lists(FUN—L) to help in selecting target
genes for experiments. A practical use of FUN-L is in building
focussed RNAi libraries.

2 Results

2.1 Algorithm and data sources

The data processing steps and algorithm used by FUN—L have
been described elsewhere (Hériché et al., 2014). In brief, FUN-L rep-
resents biological information from various sources as undirected
weighted graphs from which measures of functional similarities be—
tween genes are derived using kernels on graph nodes. A distinguish-
ing feature of FUN—L is that several kernel representations of the
data were tested for information retrieval and only the best kernel/
data combinations have been incorporated. As a result, FUN—L
applies the commute—time kernel to the following data sources: GO
similarities across biological processes, experimental protein inter—
actions from other organisms mapped by orthology to the target or—
ganism, text mining from the iHOP (Hoffmann and Valencia, 2004)
natural language processing protocol and the Random Forest kernel
to experimental protein—protein interactions from the target organ—
ism. The FUN—L score for a gene is then simply the sum of its simi-
larities to the query genes over the different data sources.

2.2 Website
The search interface is designed to be sparse and simple. Therefore,
FUN—L is parameter—free, the only requirement is that the query is a
set of genes representing the biological process of interest. As such,
our method is akin to a search engine, where a set of input query
terms returns a relevance ranking. In our resource, the search terms
are gene identifiers rather than words.

The results of the search are also in a format similar to most
search engines: a list of genes ranked by their score of relatedness to

the genes used as query (Fig. 1a). The whole ranked list can be ex—
ported as a tab—delimited file for easy use in other applications such
as siRNA design programs.

Further information such as biological process (Ashburner et al.,
2000), phenotypes (Neumann et al., 2010; Schmidt et al., 2013),
gene essentiality (Chen et al., 2012) druggability (Knox et al., 2011)
and cytoscape—web (Lopes et al., 2010) protein interactions (Fig. 1b)
can be displayed using links in the side bar.

3 Conclusion

The FUN—L website provides an easy—to—use interface to a validated
biological process prediction algorithm. FUN—L provides a system—
atic, integrated, reproducible and fast tool for target prioritisation
that is regularly updated. It compares favourably in performance
with other applications, providing an independent parameter free
method. Furthermore, it integrates extra unique information to aid
in functional analysis of the proposed candidate list. We will de—
velop these tools further in the near future to provide improved abil—
ity to interpret and filter the results. All data will be updated every 3
months to ensure results provided are up to date.

We anticipate FUN—L to be a useful tool in designing small libra-
ries of interfering RNAs targeting a biological function of interest
for cases where genome—scale screening is not affordable or possible.
Importantly, the FUN—L method has been validated on independent
data and has also been experimentally tested in human cells.

Abstract

Summary: Measuring motif similarity is essential for identifying functionally related transcription
factors (TFs) and RNA—binding proteins, and for annotating de novo motifs. Here, we describe
Motif Similarity Based on Affinity of Targets (MoSBAT), an approach for measuring the similarity
of motifs by computing their affinity profiles across a large number of random sequences. We
show that MoSBAT successfully associates de novo ChlP—seq motifs with their respective TFs,
accurately identifies motifs that are obtained from the same TF in different in vitro assays, and
quantitatively reflects the similarity of in vitro binding preferences for pairs of TFs.

Availability and implementation: MoSBAT is available as a webserver at mosbat.ccbr.utoronto.ca,

and for download at github.com/csglab/MoSBAT.

1 Introduction

The sequence preference of a transcription factor (TF) or an RNA-
binding protein (RBP) is most commonly represented using a ‘motif’,
which refers to the matrix of the probabilities of occurrence of any
given nucleotide at any given position of the binding site. Measuring
the similarity of motifs is fundamental to several aspects of studying
TFs and RBPs, such as elucidating the relationship between sequence
and function of these factors (Weirauch et 61]., 2014), assigning
known TFs and RBPs to de novo discovered motifs (Gupta et 61].,
2007), and measuring performance of in silico motif prediction
approaches (Najafabadi et 61]., 2015).

The majority of motif comparison approaches are based on
alignment of two motifs, where the similarity measure is defined
as the score of the best alignment (Gupta et 61]., 2007; Mahony
and Benos, 2007; Jiang and Singh, 2014). A few other methods

use binding site predictions to identify overlapping sites in random
sequences, allowing derivation of a motif similarity score and
alignment (Pape et 61]., 2008). Here, we introduce an alignment—
independent approach for measuring the similarity of two motifs.
The method is based on measuring the similarity of the affinity
profiles of TFs or RBPs across a large number of random se—
quences, with the affinity profiles predicted using the associated
motifs. We show that our approach for measuring Motif
Similarity Based on Affinity of Targets (MoSBAT) can accurately
identify similar motifs that are derived from different experimen-
tal methods, e.g. in order to identify TFs associated with de novo
motifs derived from ChIP—seq data. Motif similarity scores re—
ported by MoSBAT also closely reflect independent sequence pref—
erence similarity measures derived directly from in vitro
measurements.

2 Materials and methods

To measure the similarity of two motifs, we first convert the motifs
to position—specific affinity matrices (PSAMs) (Foat et al., 2006).
Then, we generate a set of N random sequences (N >20 000) of
length L (default 100 nt). For each of the two PSAMs, we calculate
the score profile across the random sequences using PSAM scanning,
as described in Supplementary Note Sl. The resulting two vectors
represent the binding ‘affinity’ profile of each of the motifs for the N
sequences (Figure 1A). By taking the logarithm of affinity vectors,
we obtain vectors that represent the binding ‘energy’ profiles of the
motifs for the N sequences. Similarity of the two motifs is then cal—
culated as the Pearson correlation coefficient (PCC) of the two affin-
ity vectors (MoSBAT—a), or the two energy vectors (MoSBAT—e).
Additional details of the methods can be found in Supplementary
Notes S1 and 52.

3 Benchmarking

We compared MoSBAT to four popular motif comparison tools
(Gupta et al., 2007; Jiang and Singh, 2014; Mahony and Benos,
2007; Pape et al., 2008) by scoring their ability to correctly match the
motifs obtained for the same protein from different assays. One such
task is assigning the correct TFs to motifs discovered by ChIP—seq,
based only on comparison to in vitro motifs. We compiled a set of 94
TFs with motifs that were discovered both by ChIP—seq and in vitro
assays (PBM, SELEX, and B1H) in the CIS—BP database (Weirauch
et al., 2014), and asked whether we can correctly label the ChIP—seq
with their respective TFs by comparison to the available in vitro
motifs. In this ‘classification’ task, the ‘positives’ are pairs of ChIP—seq

and in vitro motifs that are obtained from the same TF, the ‘negatives’
are pairs of motifs that are obtained from different TFs, and the ‘pre—
dicted value’ is the similarity between the ChIP—seq motif and the
in vitro motif, measured using different motif comparison tools.
Among 11 variations of the five tools tested, MoSBAT—e, Tomtom
(P—value) (Gupta et al., 2007) and STAMP (Mahony and Benos,
2007) were the best—performing methods with area under the receiver
operating characteristic (ROC) curve (AUROC) of 0.96 (Figure 1B).
Furthermore, when the performance of different motif comparison
tools was measured in each TF structural class separately (Figure 1C),
MoSBAT—e overall outperformed all other measures (average rank 3.1
across 14 structural classes), followed by Tomtom and STAMP (aver—
age rank 4.1). Similar results are obtained when comparing different
motifs of the same protein derived from different in vitro assays
(Supplementary Figure S2), suggesting that MoSBAT can correctly
match related motifs across various experimental platforms.

We also found that, for motifs obtained from pairs of different
TFs, MoSBAT scores closely correlate with similarity of the in vitro
binding preferences of TFs obtained directly from high-dimensional
PBM data (PCC of 8—mer Z—scores, Supplementary Figures S3—4).
These results suggest that MoSBAT can quantitatively measure the
underlying similarity of TF sequence specificity even after the high—
dimensional PBM data have been summarized as motifs. In this re—
gard, MoSBAT outperformed all other motif comparison tools by a
large margin, and was more tolerant to experimental noise
(Supplementary Figure S4).

We note that MoSBAT uses randomly generated sequences to
calculate binding affinity profiles for measuring similarity of motifs.
This stochastic process can potentially generate different scores
every time for the same pair of motifs (Supplementary Note S3).
However, our analyses suggest that MoSBAT—e scores are highly sta—
ble when >50 000 sequences are used for constructing the binding
affinity profiles (Supplementary Figure SS). MoSBAT—a scores are
also stable for short motifs, but have larger variance for some longer
motifs (Supplementary Figure SS and Supplementary Note S3).
Indeed, when the results of our motif comparison between different
in vitro methods are stratified by motif length, a small decrease in
accuracy is observed for longer motifs especially when comparing
PBM motifs to SELEX motifs, but this decrease in accuracy is com—
parable to that of Tomtom (Supplementary Figure S2D). Overall,
given the superior performance of MoSBAT—e in almost all tests,
and the biochemically relevant definition of its scoring measure, we
present it as an easy to use tool for motif comparison.

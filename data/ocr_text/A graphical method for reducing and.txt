ABSTRACT

Motivation: In Systems Biology, an increasing collection of models
of various biological processes is currently developed and made
available in publicly accessible repositories, such as biomodels.net
for instance, through common exchange formats such as SBML.
To date, however, there is no general method to relate different
models to each other by abstraction or reduction relationships, and
this task is left to the modeler for re-using and coupling models.
In mathematical biology, model reduction techniques have been
studied for a long time, mainly in the case where a model exhibits
different time scales, or different spatial phases, which can be
analyzed separately. These techniques are however far too restrictive
to be applied on a large scale in systems biology, and do not take
into account abstractions other than time or phase decompositions.
Our purpose here is to propose a general computational method for
relating models together, by considering primarily the structure of the
interactions and abstracting from their dynamics in a first step.
Results: We present a graph-theoretic formalism with node merge
and delete operations, in which model reductions can be studied as
graph matching problems. From this setting, we derive an algorithm
for deciding whether there exists a reduction from one model
to another, and evaluate it on the computation of the reduction
relations between all SBML models of the biomodels.net repository.
In particular, in the case of the numerous models of MAPK signalling,
and of the circadian clock, biologically meaningful mappings
between models of each class are automatically inferred from the
structure of the interactions. We conclude on the generality of our
graphical method, on its limits with respect to the representation of
the structure of the interactions in SBML, and on some perspectives
for dealing with the dynamics.

1 INTRODUCTION
1.1 Systems biology models

Biologists use diagrams to represent interactions between molecular
species. On the computer, diagrammatic notations like the Systems
Biology Graphical Notation (SBGN; le Novere et al., 2009) or
the one introduced in Kohn’s map (Kohn, 1999) of the cell
cycle are also employed in interactive maps like MIM (http://
discover.nci.nih.gov/miml) (Kohn et al., 2006) for instance. This
kind of graphical notation encompasses two types of information:
interactions (binding, complexation, protein modiﬁcation, etc.) and

complete with intermediary complex SE, or reduced with or without enzyme
E. The ﬁrst reduction can be achieved with the graphical operations explained
in Section 2.2, for example by merging the reaction nodes rule_1 and rule_3

rule_2. The second reduction simply deletes the blue node E.

regulations (of an interaction or of a transcription). Based on these
structures, mathematical models are developed by equipping such
molecular interaction networks with kinetic expressions leading
to quantitative models of mainly two kinds: ordinary differential
equations and continuous—time Markov chains for a stochastic
interpretation of the kinetics.

The Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML; Hucka et al.,
2003) uses a syntax of reaction rules with kinetic expressions
to deﬁne such reaction models in a precise way. For instance,
the Michaelis—Menten enzymatic reaction, in which an enzyme E
transforms a substrate S to a product P, can be described either
with a system of three reaction rules (equipped with mass action
law kinetics) showing the formation of the intermediary complex
SE as follows: S + E <=> SE => P + E, or with a single
reaction rule (equipped with a Michaelis—Menten kinetics) in which
the catalyst enzyme is supposed to be constant: S + E => P +
E, and can also be omitted as in: S => P. These three models
are represented by the bipartite graphs depicted in Figure l, and
correspond to different levels of detail for the same reaction. This
is one trivial example, among others, of reduction that can be
performed in large models and that we would like to identify
automatically.

Nowadays, an increasing collection of models of various
biological processes is indeed developed and made available
to anyone in the SBML format. For instance, the publicly—
accessible repository biomodels.net (le Novere et al., 2006)
is currently composed of 241 curated models. These different
models may represent either different biological systems, or
the same biological process at different levels of details or
under different biological assumptions. Some represent transient
directional biological processes (like signal transduction cascades),
while some others represent recurrent oscillating behaviors (like
circadian clock core genes or cell cycle control). Some models are

pretty big (about 400 nodes, which is quite a lot for a hand—written
biological model), while some others are very small (less than 10
nodes). Some models are only structural and contain only qualitative
information (e. g. known protein interactions, or phenomenological
events) while some others add precise quantitative data (with
experiment—based kinetic rates). In some cases, the structure of
the reactions is reverse—engineered from an ordinary differential
equation (ODE) model and may not reﬂect all information, such as
for instance the effect of inhibitors which cannot be distinguished
from the catalysts in the syntax of a reaction rule.

1.2 Model comparison as a graph matching problem

If modelling is the process that enables our understanding and
predicting of the behaviour of a system, then model reduction makes
our task easier. By removing what we consider as details, model
reduction allows the understanding of the core of systems, and
simulation of bigger—sized systems. In mathematical biology, model
reduction techniques have been studied for a long time, mainly in
the case where a model exhibits different time scales, or different
spatial phases, which can be analyzed separately. For instance, in the
previous example of the Michaelis—Menten enzymatic reaction, the
hypotheses that the substrate is in excess and the complex formation
is much faster than the other reactions justify the elimination of
the intermediary reactions. The mathematical conditions for quasi—
steady state approximations (Segel, 1984) or total quasi—steady state
approximations (Ciliberto et al., 2007) are however far too restrictive
to be applied to Systems Biology models on a large scale, and
do not take into account other abstractions than time or phase
decompositions.

Our applicative purpose here is to propose a general
computational method for relating models together, by considering
primarily the structure of the interactions and abstracting from
their dynamics and even the stoichiometry in a ﬁrst step. Given
two reaction graphs, the model reduction problem is to determine
whether one is a reduction of the other. This model comparison
focusses on the notion of model reﬁnement that often occurs in the
life—cycle of published biological models. Indeed, every biological
model is ‘false’ at some point and can be reﬁned to encompass more
details. The modellers usually describe these reﬁnements through
two basic operations: adding new species or reactions that were
unknown or considered secondary, or splitting existing species or
reactions into several ones, in order to give more details (about the
levels of phosphorylation of a given molecule, or about the speciﬁc
mechanistic process that underlies some reaction for instance).

Graph—matching techniques have already been used for biological
networks, but it is worth noticing that they have mostly been applied
to either protein—interaction graphs, see for instance (Chin et al.,
2008), or regulation graphs, see for instance (Naldi et al., 2009)
for a dynamics—preserving graph reduction. On reaction graphs,
graph—based techniques have been considered in Calzone et al.
(2008), Radulescu et al. (2006) and Zinovyev et al. (2008) for
modularization issues in large models. In this article, we study a
restricted notion of subgraph epimorphism, corresponding to the
application of node delete and merge operations in a reaction graph,
in order to relate a source graph to a target graph through a model
reduction relation.

In the next section, we present the graph—theoretic framework
of model reduction by graph matching, and its formal relationship

to delete and merge operations on reaction graphs. In Section 3,
we describe our algorithm for solving this particular kind of graph
matching problems and its implementation with a constraint program
written in GNU—Prolog. Then, in Section 4, we present the graphs
extracted from the biomodels repository for the evaluation, and in
Section 5, we report on the performance of our algorithm and on
the biological signiﬁcance of the matchings found automatically
in this repository. We conclude on the generality of our graphical
method for model comparison, on its limits with respect to the
representation of the structure of the interactions in SBML, and
on some perspectives for dealing with the dynamics.

2 GRAPH MATCHING METHOD

2.1 Reaction graphs

Formally, a reaction graph G is a bipartite directed graph, that is a triple
G=(S,R,A), where S is the set of species nodes, R is the set of reaction
nodes, andA g S x R UR x S the set of arcs that describes how species interact
through reactions.

There is an are (S, r) (resp. (r,s)) if s is a reactant (resp. product) of r.
Both arcs are present if s is a catalyst of r or more generally if it affects the
reaction rate of r. It is worth noting that reaction graphs do not precisely
model stoichiometry (hypergraphs would be needed for that) nor kinetics,
but describe the structure of the interactions.

2.2 Merge and delete operations

One way to relate two models is to deﬁne graph—editing operations which
make it possible to transform one reaction graph into another. A simple thing
to do when trying to reduce models is to consider that two species are variants
and treat them as equivalents, and to merge every interaction any of the two
species had into a new species. The reaction graph formalism has a symmetry
between species and reactions, so the merging process can be generalized to
reactions as well, and this will prove useful.

Another natural operation is node deletion. It may be useful for instance
to remove intermediate species, or species whose concentration is constant,
or reactions that have become trivial after a molecular merging, or reverse
reactions that occur in a much slower rate than their forward counterpart.
Model reﬁnement proceeds with the dual operations of node addition and
splitting and is thus also covered by this approach.

Let us assume that G=(S,R,A) is a reaction graph.

DEFINITION 2.1 (Pre/Post arcs). Let v e SUR, the set of pre—arcs (resp. post—
arcs) ofv is the set 'v={a EA | ElweSUR,a=(w,v)} (resp. v' ={a EA | Elwe
SUR, a = (v, w)}).

This notion extends to subsets of nodes pointwise: for V ES or V ER we
note 'V = Uvev 'v and V' = Uvevv'.

The delete operation removes a node from a reaction graph with all its
pre— and post—arcs:

DEFINITION 2.2 (Delete). Let v e S (resp. R), the result of the deletion of v in
G is the reaction graph dv(G)=(S/,R,A/) (resp. (S,R/,A/)) where

S/=S\{v} (resp. R/=R\{v})
A/=A\({v}'U'{v})
We can now deﬁne the merge operation that intuitively removes two
vertices (either two species or two reactions) from a reaction graph and

replaces them with a new one inheriting all the dangling arcs. See Figure 1
for the example of the Michaelis—Menten reduction.

Graphical model reduction

 

DEFINITION 2.3 (Merge). For all v,w e S (resp. R), we deﬁne mv,w(G) as the
reaction graph (S/,R,A/) (resp. (S ,R/ ,A/ ) ) where

S/=S\ {WM/WWW} (r6511 R/ =R\ {VaW} L’d{VW})
A/:A\({V7WI.U.{V7W})

U{(vay) | (Vol) EA 07’ (Way) GA}

U {(x, vw) | (x, v) EA or (x, w) EA}

It is worth noting that these operations delete and merge for molecules and
reactions can be implemented in a graphical editor for reaction rules as a mean
to deﬁne model reductions, and automatically derive reduced models from
simple graph editing functions. This is the case in the BIOCHAM modeling
platform (Calzone et al., 2006; Fages and Soliman, 2008) which now
integrates novel features for editing, as well as detecting, model reductions.

2.3 Subgraph epimorphisms

DEFINITION 2.4. Let G: (S, R,A) and G/ = (S/ ,R/ ,A/) be two reaction graphs.
A morphism from G to G/ is a function y. from the nodes of G,S UR,
to the nodes of G/,S/UR/, with p.(S) ES/and p.(R)§R/, such that V(x,y) e
A, (M06), #0)) EA”

An epimorphism from G to G/ is a morphism that is surjective on (both
the nodes and the arcs of) G” An isomorphism from G to G/ is a morphism
that is bijective on (both the nodes and the arcs of) G”

Notice that if there are epimorphisms from G to G/ and from G/ to G, then
there is an isomorphism from G to G’.

As shown below, graph epimorphisms relate graphs that can be obtained
by merge operations. To account for node deletions, we consider:

DEFINITION 2.5. Let G: (S, R,A) and G/ = (S/ ,R/ ,A/) be two reaction graphs.
A subgraph morphism p. from G to G/ is a morphism from a subgraph
induced by a subset of nodes of G, to G/.' S0 URO —> S/UR/,;L(So) E
S/, p.(R0) ERC with So 9 S and R0 ER, such that V(x,y) eAﬂ(S0 XRO URO ><
So),(u(x),/«L(y))€A/.

A subgraph epimorphism from G to G/ is a subgraph morphism that is
surjective.

In order to show the link with the merge and delete operations, we need
the following properties:

LEMMA 2.6 (Commutativity). Let G=(S,R,A) be a reaction graph and
(u,v)€SZUR2. G1=mu,v(G) and G2=mv,u(G) are isomorphic, i.e. there
exists a bijective morphism from G1 to G2 (or from G2 to G1).

PROOF. From Deﬁnition 2.3, it is clear that the only difference between
G1 and G2 lies in the name of the new vertex uv or vu. The function mapping
all the other vertices to themselves and uv to vu is thus a morphism from G1
to G2, and it is bijective.

LEMMA 2.7 (Associativity). Let G=(S,R,A) be a reaction graph and
(u,v,w)eS3 UR3. Then G1=muvawomuav(G) and G2=muavwomv,W(G) are
isomorphic.

PROOF. Once again it is obvious from Deﬁnition 2.3 that both graphs
have the same vertices, up to renaming of (uv)w to u(vw) and that these two
vertices have isomorphic pre— and post—arcs corresponding to the union of
all pre— and post—arcs of u, v and w. Figure 2 illustrates this.

We will denote by my the merge operation for all vertices of the set
V. Notice that if V and V/ are two disjoint subsets of vertices mVomV/ 2
mV/ omV. Furthermore, since dvodw =dwodv it also makes sense to write
dV 2 OveVdv~

THEOREM 2.8. Let G: (S,R,A) and G/ = (S/,R/,A/) be two reaction graphs.
There exists an epimorphism p. from G to G/ if and only if there exists a
ﬁnite sequence of merge operations, i. e. a ﬁnite sequence of pairs of vertices
(vi,w,-),-5n, such that the graph mvmwn o---omvo,w0 (G) is isomorphic to G”

Fig. 2. Associativity of the merge operation.

PROOF. Let us prove by induction on n that if mvmwn ou-omV0,W0(G) is
isomorphic to G/ then there exists an epimorphism from G to G’.

The base case is obvious since the identity is an epimorphism.

Now, suppose that mvmwn 0 ~ ~ ~ omvow0 (G) is isomorphic to G’, by induction
hypothesis, there exists an epimorphism u from G to G” =mvnglawng1 o---o
mvow0 (G). Now consider {:xI—>x ifx7évn and xyéwn and {(vn)={(wn)=
vw, g“ is an epimorphism from G” to mvn,wn(G”), and thus uzg‘ov is an
epimorphism from G to mvmwn 0 ~ ~ ~ omvoawo (G) which is isomorphic to G’.

Conversely, suppose that p. is an epimorphism from G to G/. The set
of preimages of p. partitions S and R in equivalence classes, let us write
them V,- = 117102;) for vl’. e S/ URC Now consider G” = my1 o - - - omvk (G): it is
isomorphic to G/ . Indeed, for every i, the nodes x of V,- are merged into a
single node v” of G”, and no V,- is empty (p. is surjective). So the function
K212; —> v” is well—deﬁned. IC is surjective on the nodes, since every node
in G” comes from the merging of a V,, thus it is bijective on the nodes. Let
(x/,y/)eA/ Since p. is also arc—surjective, (x’,y/) has a preimage (x, y)eA,
which in turn has an image (14,121”) in G”. So IC is a morphism. A morphism
which is node—bijective is an isomorphism, hence the conclusion.

Note that this proof can actually be rephrased as a proof that sequences
of merges can be associated to equivalence classes on G and then as a
corrolary of the ﬁrst isomorphism theorem (or of the fundamental theorem
on homomorphisms).

THEOREM 2.9. Let G: (S ,R,A) and G/ = (S/,R/,A/) be two reaction graphs.
There exists a subgraph epimorphism p. from G to G/ if and only if there
exists a ﬁnite sequence of delete and merge operations that, when applied
to G, yield a graph isomorphic to G/.

PROOF. Let us prove again the backward implication by induction on n.

The base case is still obvious since the identity is a subgraph epimorphism.

For the induction case, if the last operation is a merge, we obtain an
epimorphism, which, composed with a subgraph epimorphism (induction
hypothesis), leads to a subgraph epimorphism.

The only remaining case is when we have a subgraph epimorphism from
G to G” and G/ isomorphic to dv(G”). Consider S0 = S \ {v} and R0 =R \ {v},
the identity restricted to S0 and R0 deﬁnes a subgraph epimorphism from G”
to dV(G”), by composition we obtain a subgraph epimorphism from G to G/ .

Conversely, suppose that p. is a subgraph epimorphism from G to G/ .
We deﬁne so = u‘1(S/),R0 =h-1(R/), and writing S’UR’ = {V1, ...,v,,}, v,- =
117102,). Now we consider G” =mV10-uoka od5\50 odR\R0: G” is
isomorphic to G/ up to the renaming of the p.(V,-) by 12,. Indeed, all the p.(V,-)
are different since all the V,- are disjoint, for all (x, y) EA (1 (SO x R0 URO >< So)
we get both an arc (p.(x), u(y)) in A/ and an arc (vx,vy) in G”. By deﬁnition,
these are exactly the arcs of G”, and by surjectivity of u, it also covers every
arc of G/ . Hence the conclusion.

Notice that if G is mapped to G/ by a sequence of merge and
delete operations, any sequence of merges and deletes yielding the same
equivalence classes as the proof above leads to a G” isomorphic to G/

We have seen examples of permutations between merge operations
and between delete operations, another example of transformation is
that of permuting a delete with a merge, one actually removes the
merge: duvomuav =d{u,v}

3 ALGORITHM AND IMPLEMENTATION

The subgraph isomorphism problem is a well—known NP—complete
problem, which means that there does not exist an efﬁcient algorithm
for solving all problem instances in polynomial time, if we admit
the conjecture P #NP. Nevertheless, the practical instances of such
problems may well be solved by efﬁcient algorithms and it is the
purpose of this section to describe an algorithm for our particular
class of bipartite graph—matching problems. It is easy to see that
our subgraph epimorphism problem is at least as hard as the graph
isomorphism problem which is not known to be in P. However we
do not know whether it is NP—complete.

The mathematical deﬁnition of subgraph epimorphisms given in
the previous section can be encoded quite directly in an executable
constraint program. Constraint programming is a declarative
programming style which relies on two components: one modeling
of the problem using elementary constraints over ﬁnite domain
variables and one search procedure. Constraint programming has
been applied with success to graph—matching problems in le Clement
et al. (2009). For this work, we developed a GNU—prolog (Diaz,
2003) program dedicated to our particular subgraph epimorphism
problems, using ﬁnite domain constraints and a simple search
strategy for enumerating all solutions by backtracking.

Graph morphisms can be modeled quite naturally by introducing
one variable per node of the source graph, with, as domain, one
(integer) value per node of the target graph. A variable assignment
thus represents a mapping from the source nodes to the target nodes.
The morphism condition itself is written with f d_relation
tabular constraints, which forces a tuple of variables to take its value
in a list of tuples of integers.

The surjectivity property could be represented by the cardinality
constraint f d_at_leas t_One of GNU—Prolog but a more
efﬁcient modeling was found by creating variables for target arcs
with the set of source arcs as domain, and using the global constraint
fd_all_different.

Then, the enumeration on the target arc variables enforces
surjectivity. This enumeration is done before the enumeration of
node variables that enforces the computation of a morphism.

4 DATA

The aim of our concept of subgraph epimorphism in bipartite graphs
is to automatically relate and compare Systems Biology models in
repositories like biomodels.net. We consider the latest version (26
January 2010) of biomodels.net which contains 241 curated models
of various origins but all encoded in SBML. From the SBML format,
it is possible to extract the reaction graph as follows:

(1) create a vertex for each species;

(2) create a vertex for each reaction;

(3) add an are from a species to a reaction if it is listed in its
reactants or modiﬁers;

(4) add an are from a reaction to a species if it is listed in its
products or modiﬁers.

A thematic clustering was done, using information available from
the notes of the SBML model. We focus here on the most populated
classes:

0 mitogen—activated protein kinase;
0 circadian clock;
0 calcium oscillations;

0 cell cycle.

For each class, all morphisms between pairs of models are tried.

5 RESULTS

In our algorithm, the set of all morphisms, or a proof of non—
existence, are obtained by backtracking. In the experiments reported
below, the computation time was limited with a timeout of 20 min but
most of the problems were solved in <5 s on standard PC quadcore
at 2.8 GHz.

5.1 Mapk models

The matchings found between the models of the MAPK cascade are
depicted in Figure 3. This class contains the family of models of
Markevich et al. (2005) numbered 26—31. The reductions found
automatically among these models are interesting for checking
whether the formalism is faithful to biological reasoning, since
the authors describe reﬁnements between them. The models are of
different sizes but always consider only one level of the traditional
three levels of the MAPK cascade.

In this family, models 27, 29 and 31 are the simpler ones: they
have few molecules because the catalyses are represented with
only one reaction. The epimorphism exhibited from model 31 to
27 corresponds to the splitting of two variants of MAPKK in 31.
Model 29 distinguishes between the sites of phosphorylation of Mp,
yielding a model with two molecules MpY and MpT. The subgraph
epimorphism found from 29 to 27 corresponds to the deletion of one
variant of Mp. Conversely, this distinction prevents the existence of
an epimorphism from 31 or 27 to 29.

Models 26, 28 and 30 have more detailed catalyze mechanisms
and differ as previously by the phosphorylation sites of Mp.

However, some epimorphisms from big models to small ones
may have no biological meaning. This comes from the absence of
constraint on the nodes that can be merged, and the relatively high
number of arcs in Markevich’s small models where most molecules
are catalysts. Still, model 26 (with non—differentiated Mp) does not
reduce to model 29 since that model indeed distinguishes MpY and
MpT variants.

Now, concerning three—step MAPK cascade models, the models
9 and 11 of (Huang and Ferrell, 1996) and (Levchenko et al.,
2000) respectively are detected as isomorphic. Indeed, they only
differ by molecule names and parameter values. They do not reduce
to 28 and 30, which are models that do not differentiate sites of
phosphorylation. They do not reduce to 26 either, which uses a more
detailed mechanism for dephosphorilations.

Graphical model reduction

 

 

Fig. 3. Matchings found between all models of the MAPK cascade
(Schoeberl’s model 14 and Levchenko’s model with scaffold 19 are not
represented here, they do not map each other but can be mapped to small
models).

Model 10 is another three—step MAPK with no catalysts for
dephosphorilations. It has the particularity to be cyclic, that
is, the last level’s most phosphorylated molecule catalyzes the
phosphorylations of the ﬁrst level. This is shown here as a reduction
of the previous models obtained by merging the output of the third
level with the catalyst of the ﬁrst level.

Finally, models 49 and 146 are bigger than the others and can
easily be matched by them, and there were some comparisons for
which no result was found before the timeout.

5.2 Circadian clock models

The matchings found in the class of circadian clock models are
depicted in Figure 4. Models 16, 24, 25 and 36 being very small
oscillators were matched by most of other models, and for that reason
were left out from the picture.

Let us ﬁrst have a look at the isomorphisms found.

Models 73 and 78 are isomorphic. This is in accordance with
the fact that these quite detailed models come from Leloup and
Goldbeter (2003) and differ indeed by parameter values.

Models 74 and 83 are isomorphic too. They also correspond to two
versions of a second model from the same article, but this time with
the addition of the Rev—Erba loop, greyed out in Figure 1 of Leloup
and Goldbeter (2003). The authors explain ‘Taking into account
explicitly the role of REV—ERBa in the indirect negative feedback
exerted by BMALl on the expression of the Bmall gene requires
an extension of the model, which is now governed by 19 instead
of 16 kinetic equations’. The mapping to the previous models is
automatically detected in accordance with these explanations, by
merging the three new species (Rev—Erba mRNA, protein in the
cytoplasm and protein in the nucleus named Mr, Rc and Rn in model
74) to Bmall in the nucleus (named Bn in model 73).

Model 34 (Smolen et al., 2004) is a quite small model of the
Drosophila’s circadian clock. The fact that its structure is included
in that of the mammalian clock of the above models is in accordance
with the fact those models were built on top of knowledge from the
Drosophila (Goldbeter, 1995) with a similar clock mechanism.

Models 171 (Leloup and Goldbeter, 1998) presents a model for the
Drosophila, including Per/Tim (with two levels of phosphorylation)
and the complex. Model 21 (Leloup and Goldbeter, 1999) actually
studies the same model, unfortunately a different encoding in
SBML (variable parameters instead of species for instance) makes
it impossible to ﬁnd a matching.

Many models map to model 170 (Becker—Weimann et al., 2004)
which focusses on the positive feedback loop of the circadian cycle
oscillator. It is quite small but has two compartments, which explains

‘ 083_Lelo

why only 34 cannot be reduced to it. Model 22 (Ueda et al., 2001)
is a quite detailed model that focusses on the interlocked feedback
loops, which can be mapped to 170 but not 34. Models 55 (Locke
et al., 2005) and 89 (Locke et al., 2006) are both from Locke and
others and about the circadian clock of Arabidopsis but include, in
one case light induction, and in the other a new feedback loop. This
explains why they do not give any matching either, except to the
small oscillator model 170.

5.3 Calcium oscillation models

Figure 5 shows that many models of calcium oscillation are
connected.

Models 98, 115 and 117 are in fact isomorphic due to their very
small size (only two species) and differ only by their kinetics. There
is a morphism from model 166 to them in accordance to the addition
of a third species in this model where Ca2+ oscillations are seen as
a mediator of genetic expression.

Models 43, 44 and 45 all relate to three different models from
the same article (Borghans et al., 1997). Model 43 is the ‘basic one
pool’ model and there is a match from 44, the ‘1—pool model with IP3
degradation’ since the latter is indeed a reﬁnement of the former. The
morphisms from 43 and 44 to 166 correctly exhibit the inclusion of
the basic three—element oscillator in those models. A false positive
morphism is found however from 44 to 45, the ‘2—pool model’.
This morphism is purely formal and has no biological meaning. It
could be eliminated by using annotations as further constraints, for
instance by taking into account the references to UniProt/KEGG or
ChEBI databases that are already present in some SBML models.

Model 122 (Fisher et al., 2006) is actually a big model of NFAT
and NFKB with a side calcium oscillator. However, it includes many
reversible reactions and thus structurally maps to all of the other
models of this class.

Model 58 is a coupled oscillator version which interestingly maps
to the ‘2—pool’ oscillator of Borghans et al. (1997) by merging some
components of the two oscillators into one.

Finally, models 39, related to mitochondria, and 145, related to
ATP—induced oscillations, only map the small oscillators already
described.

5.4 Cell-cycle models

The reaction graphs of the cell cycle models are plagued by a
common problem: these models originate from ODE models and
the reaction graphs extracted from their encoding in SBML format
does not correctly represent the structure of these models. It is thus
hard to make sense of mappings between such graphs. For instance,
the graphs of models 7, 8 and 56 are disconnected. Models 111, 144

and 196 have ghost molecules, that is, molecules which appear in
the kinetics but not in the stoichiometry.

Nevertheless, models 144, 56 and 109 are relatively big with more
than 50 reactions, and map easily on smaller models. Actually, there
are 16 comparisons missing from this graph, and 13 are comparisons
from these bigger graphs to the smaller ones.

Models 8, 168 and 196 are small (less than 15 reactions), which
make them easy to match to, excepted for 196, which has a big
diameter (Fig. 6). There is no matching from 111 to 8 however. This
is explained by the erroneous structure of 8 which is disconnected.

5.5 Negative control

For the sake of completeness of the evaluation of our method, the
reduction relations between all pairs of models of the biomodels.net
repository have been computed (with a time out of 20 min per
problem).

Some matchings between unrelated model classes were found.
These false positive matchings typically arise with small models that
formally appear as reductions of large models without any biological
meaning, for the same reasons as in the cases discussed above within
a same class. These false positives arise in less than 9% of the total
inter—class pairs, and in 1.2% of the tests after the removal of the
small models.

6 CONCLUSION

Constraint—based graph—matching algorithms have shown their
effectiveness and efﬁciency to analyze and automatically relate
biochemical reaction models on a large scale, namely among the 241
curated models of the systems biology repository biomodels.net. Of
course, such an automatic correspondence between models inferred
solely from the structure of the reaction graph may be biologically

erroneous in some cases. In particular, small reaction graphs can be
recognized as motifs of biologically unrelated large reaction graphs.

Nevertheless, the search for subgraph epimorphisms between
all models of the biomodels.net repository revealed connected
components roughly corresponding to the different models of
similar biological systems for the MAPK signaling cascade, the
circadian clock and the calcium oscillation models, automatically
exhibiting morphisms, corresponding to model reductions, as well
as isomorphisms, corresponding to variants of the same model with
different parameter values.

On the other hand, the cell—cycle models of this repository often
originate from ODE models that have been transcribed in SBML
rules without correctly reﬂecting the structure of the interactions.
As a result, many model reductions could not be detected as graph
morphisms. More work is thus needed to curate the expression of
these models in SBML, and also to restrict mappings by considering
the information on molecular species present in the annotations, for
instance.

Although necessarily imperfect, this approach opens a new way
to query Systems Biology model repositories and study model
reductions as subgraph epimorphism problems, before taking into
account constraints on the stoichiometry and the dynamics of the
reactions.

As a perspective for future work, the formal ground presented here
in terms of graph operations and graph morphisms is currently used
to investigate mathematical conditions under which the kinetics are
compatible with graph reduction operations, such as for instance:

0 reaction deletions for slow reverse reactions,
0 reaction mergings for reaction chains with a limiting reaction,
0 molecular species deletions for species in excess,

0 molecular mergings for quasi—steady state approximations.

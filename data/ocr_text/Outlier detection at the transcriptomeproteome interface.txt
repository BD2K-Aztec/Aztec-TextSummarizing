Abstract

Background: In high-throughput experimental biology, it is widely acknowledged that while ex-
pression levels measured at the levels of transcriptome and the corresponding proteome do not, in
general, correlate well, messenger RNA levels are used as convenient proxies for protein levels.
Our interest is in developing data-driven computational models that can bridge the gap between
these two levels of measurement at which different mechanisms of regulation may act on different
molecular species causing any observed lack of correlations. To this end, we build data-driven pre-
dictors of protein levels using mRNA levels and known proxies of translation efficiencies as covari-
ates. Previous work showed that in such a setting, outliers with respect to the model are reliable
candidates for post-translational regulation.

Results: Here, we present and compare two novel formulations of deriving a protein concentration
predictor from which outliers may be extracted in a systematic manner. The first approach, outlier
rejecting regression, allows explicit specification of a certain fraction of the data as outliers. In a re-
gression setting, this is a non-convex optimization problem which we solve by deriving a difference
of convex functions algorithm (DCA). With post-translationally regulated proteins, one expects
their concentrations to be affected primarily by disruption of protein stability. Our second algorithm
exploits this observation by minimizing an asymmetric loss using quantile regression and extracts
outlier proteins whose measured concentrations are lower than what a genome-wide regression
would predict. We validate the two approaches on a dataset of yeast transcriptome and proteome.
Functional annotation check on detected outliers demonstrate that the methods are able to identify
post-translationally regulated genes with high statistical confidence.

correlations between these two (Gygi et al., 1999; Futcher et al.,
1999; Marguerat et al., 2012). Except under specific functional cate-
gories, correlation between the two is difficult to demonstrate. The
reason for this is that different species of mRNA/proteins are regu-
lated by different mechanisms at the post-transcriptional and post-
translational levels.

The approach pursued in this work, starting from Tuller et al.
(2007) and Gunawardana and Niranj an (2013), is to formulate a re-
gression problem in which the response variable is the protein con-
centration and the covariates are the mRNA levels and other proxies
for the stability and translation efficiency of the transcripts.
Gunawardana and Niranjan (2013) used a linear regression model
with a sparsity inducing regularizer (lasso) (Tibshirani, 1994) and
showed that of about 37 features taken as inputs, a combination of
five features including mRNA levels and translation efficiencies yield
good prediction of protein levels. In fact, these best five features are
mRNA abundance (Greenbaum et al., 2003), tRNA adaption index
(tAI), codon bias (Wall et al., 2005), ribosome density and occu-
pancy (Arava et al., 2003). The outliers with respect to this linear re-
gression were shown to carry significant over-representation of
post-translationally regulated proteins, which is to be expected since
the input covariates do not have any information about post-transla-
tional modifications (PTMs).

In this article, we introduce two novel computational methods
that detect outliers in a regression setting and demonstrate their use-
fulness in the analysis of transcriptomic and proteomic datasets.
Our focus is specific in that we attempt to detect from the data those
proteins that are likely candidates for post-translational regulation.
The relevant biological insight, introduced in Gunawardana and
Niranj an (2013), is that if the concentration of a protein is regulated
post-translationally, the measured abundance (P) of it is likely to be
lower than what a global data-driven model trained on a
genomic-wide scale might predict (13). This is because the primary
mechanism by which post-translational regulation might be imple-
mented is the disruption of protein stability. However, other modifi-
cations which occur post-translationally, such as hydrophobicity,
localization and enzymatic activities will not be detected by this
approach.

The first novel model, we introduce in this article is outlier re-
jecting regression (ORR) model which formulates a regression prob-
lem that requires a user-specified fraction of the data to be returned
as outliers with respect to the regression model. This is achieved via
specifying a particular loss function, the clipped (truncated) loss
which is shown to be equivalent to defining a certain fraction of the
data as outliers (Xu et al., 2006). We show how this objective func-
tion may be optimized via a difference of convex functions
algorithm (DCA). For this formulation, we also present an alterna-
tive ad—hoc variant of optimization strategy (Methods). Our second
method is the use of quantile regression (QR) with omic measure-
ments, a technique which is effectively used in a range of areas
including economics (Hendricks and Koenker, 1992; Koenker,
2005), medicine(Cole and Green, 1992; Heagerty and Pepe, 1999)
and survival analysis (Koenker and Geling, 2001). QR enables the
specification of an asymmetric loss function, where the user can de-
fine the outliers to be selected either with positive or negative losses.
Thus, this approach is more suitable with our initial hypothesis be-
cause our main focus lies on the negative losses of a global predictor
(measured abundance lower than the predicted—P < 13) to detect
post-translationally regulated proteins. We believe that these are
much neater ways of approaching the problem, than to simply im-
plement a regression and hope the outliers to contain those post-
translationally regulated genes.

2 Methods

In this article, we compare three types of outlier detection tech-
niques at the transcriptome-proteome interface. Those are:

Model 0—Simple Linear Regression with the proteins lying further
away from the regression line are considered as outliers. This
method was used in Gunawardana and Niranjan (2013)’s study
(previous work), where the regression was carried out with 37 in-
put features with sparse inducing penalty (lasso) which selected
ﬁve dominant features. In this study, all three models use these
best ﬁve features as inputs: mRNA abundance, tAI, codon bias,
ribosome density and occupancy,

Model 1—Novel ORR model, which explicitly formulates a user-
deﬁned proportion of the data as outliers. The model is estimated
using two variants of constrained minimization algorithm (Section
2.1) which have similar convergence and outlier detection proper-
ties on the transcriptome-proteome problem,

Model 2—QR, allowing asymmetric loss functions to detect outliers
only with negative losses (Section 2.2).

ORR (Model 1) and QR (Model 2) are the newly proposed methods
and linear regression (Model 0) was only used to compare the new re-
sults with the previous work. Implementation details of the models are
summarized later, with further derivations given in Supplementary
Material (Section A) available with the online version of this article.

2.1 Outlier rejecting regression

Let {(xi, y,)}i=1,  ,m where x,- 6 IR” and y,- 6 IR be the set of m training
samples. Our goal is to predict y as f (x) = (w, x) + b. For any arbi-
trary convex loss function E(x, y; w, 19) such as hinge loss, squared loss
and logistic loss, we define the clipped loss function using a variable 11
(e.g. Yang et al., 2010; Wu and Liu, 2007) as below:

Edam); w, 19) == min {3(x,y;w, 19), U},
= Orgyglnﬁxwm 19) + U(1 — 11),

where the hyper parameter U> 0 to denotes the clipping threshold
[Xu et al. (2006) for the second equality].

Here, we consider L2 regularized loss function in ridge regres-
sion (Equation 1) for the ORR model, which is similar to the
squared loss £(x,y;w,b) :2 {y — ((w, x) + 19)}2, but with an add-
itional regularization term to penalize data over-fitting and model
complexity (Tibshirani, 1996; Andrew and Gao, 2007);

H33}; 211er + {y — (<w,x> + of, <1)

where 2 > 0.
Therefore, a clipped loss model for the ridge regression problem
can be written as below:

- 2
Z i) i; 7b) 2
II}va illwll +21: u(x y w ) ( )

where U > 0 and 2 > 0 are hyper parameters.
It is troublesome to control U to define the outliers because this
hyper parameter is highly depending on the error value distribution
of the data samples. Therefore, we use a parameter which corres-
ponds to the outlier ratio )1 E [0, 1) instead of U and consider the fol-
lowing model:

where ,ue [0,1) and 26 (0,00) are hyper parameters.

See Supplementary Material or Xu et al. (2006) for the relationship
between Equations (2) and (3).

We believe the fraction of data to be expected as outliers is prob-
ably easier to specify using prior knowledge of the problem domain,
than a threshold U on the regression loss.

Note that Ziﬂ — 11,-) 2 pm holds at the optimality. The sample
(xi, 31,-) with 11;k = 0 can be regarded as an outlier for small u > 0.
However, this is a non-convex problem and finding a global solution
for a non-convex problem is difficult.

2.1.1 Difference of convex functions algorithm

DCA (Pham Dinh and Le Thi, 1997; Collobert et al., 2006) was em-
ployed to obtain plausible solutions for our non-convex problem.
To solve the Equation (3), DCA updates 11 and (w, b) alternatively.
We denote the solution at the lath iteration as (wk, 19,211"). 11" is com-
puted using (wk, bk) as

11" E argmax,’ Zia — 111)£(xia)’i§wkabk)

s.t.Ziﬂ — 11,-) 2 pm, 0§11,-§1.

We can find 11k by sorting the losses and assigning 0 to 115-e with
large loss. Hence, the computational cost is very small. (wk+1,bk+1)
is also computed using 11k as a solution of the following convex

problem:

For a non-smooth convex loss function £(.), let WM and V1,“.
) denote subgradients of  with respect to w and b. The sequence
(wk, bk) generated by Algorithm 1 has the following good conver-
gence properties: the objective value of Equation (3) is decreasing
and every limit point of the sequence is a critical point satisfying a
necessary condition for local minima of (3).

Algorithm 1 shows the DCA approach in a pseudo-code format.
This was implemented using CVX package in MATLAB environment.

2.1.2 Alternative heuristic implementation of DCA
We also used an alternative heuristic implementation of DCA
in ORR model (again using CVX package in MATLAB) as
shown in Algorithm 2. 2 and u values were set similar to the
Algorithm 1 (Ii = 0.01 and u = 0.975). We observed that this
implementation also selects the same set of proteins as similar to
Algorithm 1. Thus, these two algorithms produce identical results.
Algorithm 2 is similar to Algorithm 1, but easier and more intui-
tive. The difference between Algorithm 1 and 2 is the step where a
subproblem is solved. Algorithm 2 solves Equation (3) with respect
to (w, b) by fixing 11. Therefore, we solve the following problem:

- 2 1 k . ..
r533 lllwll +(1_H)m;m€(xz,yuw,b)- <8)

MATLAB scripts for Algorithm 1 (function ORR1) and 2 (func-
tion ORR2) are shown in Supplementary Material (Section A).

2.2 Quantile regression
Here, we consider different weights for the negative and positive
losses given by y — ((w, x) + b), for all 1'. r 6 (0,1) determines the
quantile of interest and r = 0.5 represents the symmetric error with
conditional median (Koenker, 2005).

Quantile loss is given as p,(y — ((w, x) + 19)) where

r- if
prw Z { (Z) (820,

otherwise.

We can obtain the outliers of our interest [i.e. in our case
{y — ((w, x) + 19)} < 0] using Equation (10) by setting the r to the
required quantile.

HE? Emm- — ((mxi) + 19D} (10)

Equation (10) can be solved as a linear program as shown in
Equation (11). We used linprog function in MATLAB environment to
implement Equation (1 1).

2.3 Post-translational regulation annotation check
Similar to the previous work (Gunawardana and Niranjan, 2013),
functional annotation check was carried out at two levels (i.e. coarse
and finer levels). At the coarse level, PTMs keywords obtained by
UniProt database (Magrane and Consortium, 2011) were consider
as the only requirement to indicate post-translation regulation and
at the finer level, PTMs coupled with the motif information (i.e.
Phosphorylation+PEST motifs, Acetylation+N-termini segments
and Ubiquitination+D or KEN Box motifs) which are directly af-
fecting the protein stability were considered as more powerful indi-
cators to post-translation regulation. EMBOSS explorer epestfind
(Rice et al., 2000), NetAcet 1.0 (Kiemer et al., 2005) and GPS-ARM
1.0 toolkit (Liu et al., 2012) databases were used to obtain motif in-
formation for PEST, N-termini segment and D/Ken box motifs,
respectively.

Investigating the statistical significance of the number of post-
translationally regulated proteins detected in the outlier region with
respect to all other proteins was measured by obtaining 1000 ran-
dom samples with sample size 50 (2.5% from the total dataset),
where the sampling process can be considered as computationally
exhausting.

We also carried out a gene enrichment analysis on the outlier
sets to uncover useful biological insights. Gene ontology (GO)
analysis of outliers was performed using BiNGO 2.44, a plugin
for Cytoscape (Maere et al., 2005) and PANTHER web tool by
Thomas et al. (2003) was used for pathway analysis. We also
used WebGestalt tool which draws from multiple large databases
to explore more gene enrichment properties (Zhang et al., 2005 ).
Protein-protein interactions at the physical layer was carried out
using BioGRID database (Stark et al., 2006) and GeneMANIA
web tool was employed to discover more biological network re-
lationships among the outlier proteins (Warde-Farley et al.,
2010).

3 Results

3.1 Regression

With the five selected input features [covariates chosen in the previ-
ous work, Gunawardana and Niranjan (2013)], all three regression
models achieved a good level of predicting out of sample protein lev-
els (R2 = 0.86 for simple linear regression, R2 = 0.86 for ORR and
R2 = 0.85 for QR). Figure 1 shows the three prediction results as
scatter plots [predicted (P) against measured (P) concentration] with
the detected outlier points are shown as circles. We also compared
the outputs of ORR and QR models to confirm that both produce
correlated results. Figure 2 illustrates that these two new models
produce highly correlated results with R2 = 0.97. Additionally,
Supplementary Figure S2 shows the correlation of ORR and QR
model outputs with respect to the simple linear regression model
and we observed that all three models produced highly correlated
outputs.

Afterwards, these three sets of outliers were tested at two levels
(coarse and finer) of functional annotations to obtain evidence for
post-translational regulation. Table 1 shows that all three regression
models have high level of confidence (P-values < 0.05) to support
our hypothesis at both levels. Note that QR model gives the highest
confidence level to detect post-translationally regulated proteins as
outliers.

3.2 Validating ORR and OR models

Two synthetic datasets were employed to validate the outlier detec-
tion by ORR and QR models. Hawkins et al. (1984)’s artificial
dataset was used to detect outliers using ORR model which con-
tained two groups of outliers with positive and negative losses, re-
spectively. Boston Housing Data from UCI Machine Learning
Repository (Bache and Lichman, 2013) was employed to detect one
side (positive loss) outliers using QR model. Supplementary Figure

further details.

the models detect different sets of data as outliers (Fig. 3, Venn diagram for
overlap) due to the nature of loss function imposed

3.3 ORR convergence speed

We also compared the convergence speed of Algorithm 1 and 2 of
ORR model using four different datasets (Supplementary Section
D). Supplementary Figure S4 shows, in all cases, Algorithm 2 con-
verges faster than Algorithm 1. Note that the convergence speed
also depends on the size of the dataset. Though, the speed is not a
major factor with respect to our problem (transcriptome-proteome
data), Algorithm 2 may well be a better implementation for large re-
gression problems.

3.4 Biological interpretation of outliers

Figure 3 shows the distribution of outlier genes of the three regres-
sion models in a Venn diagram. Ninety-two and 17 genes were
found as the union and the intersection of the Venn diagram, re-
spectively. Here, we discuss biological aspects of these outliers using
GO enrichment and pathway analysis.

Gene enrichment analysis carried out on the union of 92 genes
found by all three models showed several GO terms and pathways
related to translational and post-translational regulation. These are
shown in Supplementary Table S1 and Figure S5. Ribosomal GO
terms were dominant in biological process category and WebGestalt
tool also found several keywords related to ribosomal proteins
(Supplementary Table 52). It is known that, ribosomal proteins
undergo several post-translational regulation such as N-terminal
acetylation, removal of methionine, phosphorylation and N-ter-
minal methylation (Carroll et al., 2008). However, previous work
(Gunawardana and Niranjan, 2013) discusses that ribosomal
proteins did not unduly inﬂuence the over-representation of post-
translational regulation of the outliers in a global regression model.

We subjected the consensus (intersections) and the union genes
for pathway analysis. Interestingly in all cases (considering two
models at a time and all three), the 125 3 pathway and 125 3 pathway
feedback loop contained significant over-representation of outlier
genes. Shin et al. (2013) showed that protein degradation mechan-
ism of post-translational regulation enables robust p53 regulation
by stabilizing the 125 3 levels with less energy. In fact, during DNA

damage conditions, Mdm2 feedback loop down-regulates 125 3 levels
by the aid of the protein degradation process of post-translational
regulation (Smardova et al., 2005; Shin et al., 2013). Thus, the over-
representation of outlier genes in the 125 3 related pathways re-con—
firmed our hypothesis by providing evidence that the outliers are
more likely to be post-translationally regulated.

Further, protein interaction network was constructed using
BioGRID interactome database to identify physical interactions of
protein product from outlier genes (union 92 genes) defined by our
three models (Supplementary Figure S6). Large cluster of this net-
work includes ribosomal subunits such as RPS16B, RP517B, RPS13,
RPs14A, RRPZB, RPL17A, RPL17B and RPS9B, which were mostly
selected as outliers from simple linear regression model (Model 0).
As mentioned earlier, ribosomal proteins have efficient translational
activities (Warner, 1999), followed by several post-translational
regulation (Carroll et al., 2008). In addition to the main cluster of
ribosomal subunit components, another protein cluster with hub
PHO88, the protein which are known to be involved with phosphate
ion transport and protein maturation (Copic et al., 2009), was iden-
tified and this is a process which involves in phosphorylation PTM
to adapt phosphate group to the protein (Burnett and Kennedy,
1954). Supplementary Figure S7 shows co-expression, genetic, pre-
dicted and physical interaction networks obtained by GeneMANIA
web tool. Co-expression network gave the highest coverage of the
related proteins. However, it did not show any statistical signifi-
cance of our union outlier set with respect to random samples
(Supplementary Section F). We also observed that, with all four net-
works, ribosomal proteins tend to cluster together (purple colour
nodes in Supplementary Figure S7) and the physical interactions are
similar to BioGRID output.

Additionally, we also carried out a finer level functional annota-
tion check, GO and pathway analysis on the common genes (inter-
section of two models and all three) to discuss more biological
insights of these outlier genes (Supplementary Section E). We
observed an over-representation of PTM functional annotations and
125 3 related pathways with all the combinations of outlier sets.

4 Discussion

Tests against functional annotation of yeast gene products show
that all three methods can detect outlier proteins that are likely can-
didates for post-translational regulation with high statistical confi-
dence. However, main biological insight that we start from is that
post-translational regulation should primarily act by disrupting the
stability of proteins whereby the measured concentrations should be
lower than what might be predicted from a genome-wide regression
with mRNA level properties of individual species as input variables.
Two of the models we considered (simple linear regression and
ORR) do not model this asymmetric explicitly and hence find out-
liers on either side (i.e. P < P and P > P). In linear regression, the
vast majority of outliers found had P < P, in line with our insight,
and only two proteins were found as outliers on the P > P side. This
has to be regulated as a prediction result obtained by fitting a data-
driven model through noisy data. When we force the model to label
a fraction of the data as outliers in ORR model, the minimization of
the loss function picks up outliers on either side (i.e. P < P and
P > P). However, majority of the outliers and the post-translato-
nally regulated proteins were detected from the upper region
(P < P) of the regression. When we compared the outliers detected
on either side of ORR model, we found 7 of the 15 outliers detected
at the lower region (P > P) did not have post-translational regula-
tion, and correspondingly the confidence levels with which ORR
model identify post-translationally regulated proteins was lower.
The QR model, which allows as to explicitly impose our asymmetric
loss function turns out to be the best match to exploit the biological
insight we purse here, and the proteins picked up by this model yield
the highest statistical confidence in annotation checks. Pathway ana-
lysis further supports the hypothesis due to the over-representation
observation of 125 3 related pathways.

5 Conclusion

In this work, we presented two novel approaches to detect post-
translationally regulated proteins as outliers in a regression problem.
The novelty of the computational formulations we explore in this
work lies in (i) the explicit formulation that a certain fraction of
data should be detected as outliers, and (ii) the error to be minimized
being one sided because the measured concentration of post-transla-
tionally regulated proteins are expected to be lower than what a glo-
bal regression would predict. Both these are ways of capturing our
prior knowledge of the problem domain in the computational for-
mulation. The methods we propose are shown to have the power to
identify proteins whose stability is disturbed by post-translationally
acting processes to a statistical significance, thus these data-driven
techniques help to uncover functional aspects of molecular biology.

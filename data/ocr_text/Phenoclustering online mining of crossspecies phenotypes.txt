ABSTRACT

Summary: Recently, several methods for analyzing phenotype data
have been published, but only few are able to cope with data
sets generated in different studies, with different methods, or for
different species. We developed an online system in which more than
300 000 phenotypes from a wide variety of sources and screening
methods can be analyzed together. Clusters of similar phenotypes
are visualized as networks of highly similar phenotypes, inducing
gene groups useful for functional analysis. This system is part of
PhenomicDB, providing the world’s largest cross-species phenotype
data collection with a tool to mine its wealth of information.

1 INTRODUCTION

Since Mendel, phenotypes, especially with regard to diseases,
have been studied intensively to reveal genotype—phenotype
relationships. Recently, the number of available methods to generate
such data has grown signiﬁcantly, leading to the availability of large
amounts of data, scattered over a multitude of data sources mostly
dedicated to single species or diseases (Groth and Weiss, 2006).
From these, integrative cross—species databases, like PhenomicDB
(Groth et al., 2007) have emerged, building the ground for
performing meta—analyses of phenotypes across species or studies
with the goal to gain insights into the genetic origin of diseases.
However, there are only very few tools that allow analyzing such
complex data.

In a recent meta—analysis of cross—species phenotype data (Groth
et al., 2008), we showed that clustering the free—text descriptions
of phenotypes (phenoclustering) using advanced natural language
processing methods induces a clustering of genes (by similarity
of their associated phenotype) that can be exploited for guilt—by—
association analysis. In particular, we showed that it is possible to
predict gene function within such groups with high precision. This
method is now freely available as an interactive tool integrated into
the phenotype database PhenomicDB.

(from yeast to human), and derived from a variety of sources. The
database currently contains 327 070 unique phenotypes connected to
70 588 genes. Approximately 36% of the phenotypes are associated
to genes from either Drosophila melanogaster or Caenorhabditis
elegans. Genes from Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Mus musculus
and Homo sapiens are associated to 12.5%, 6% and 1% of the
phenotypes, respectively. The remaining 27 800 phenotypes are
associated to genes from other species.

PhenomicDB speciﬁcally has been built to enable analysis
across techniques and species. Phenotypes from orthologous genes
can help gaining insight into the function of a gene from
a species with no phenotypic information available. Therefore,
PhenomicDB incorporates 43 998 eukaryotic orthology groups
from HomoloGene. Through orthology, 98 543 genes having no
phenotype directly associated to them are connected to phenotypic
annotation of orthologs. For example, only 2405 human genes are
directly linked to a human phenotype, but another 8389 human genes
can be associated to a phenotype by orthology (Fig. l).

3 PHENOCLUSTERS

Orthology helps to transfer phenotype information based on
genotypes. However, it is also possible to transfer functional
information based on similar phenotypes, as shown in Groth et al.
(2008). In this work, we compared phenotypes based on their textual
description because no comprehensive vocabulary for describing

Phenoclustering

 

phenotypes exists (and those that exist are used only sparsely). We
built clustered similar phenotypes using the vector space model for
text similarity and showed that the emerging clusters are biologically
coherent, enabling gene function prediction with a precision of over
70%. By overweighting terms from phenotype—related ontologies
[Medical Subject Headings and Mammalian Phenotype Ontology
(Smith et al., 2005)], results improve by ~5% (unpublished data).
A detailed description on how such clusters results can be produced
is given in Supplementary File 1.

This method is now available online, directly working on the
quarterly updated content of PhenomicDB. Phenotype clusters are
computed anew with every database update and can be inspected
graphically through a web front—end or downloaded for further
analysis. To assess their biological meaningfulness, the system also
computes for every cluster an enrichment score in terms of protein—
protein interactions (PPI), a GO—similarity score and the sequence
similarity of the proteins associated to the phenotypes.

4 THE PHENOCLUSTER VIEW

Phenoclusters can be accessed by ﬁrst searching for a gene or
phenotype of interest in the search interface. The resulting hit list
shows genes and associated phenotypes. Most phenotypes also have
a ‘Show Cluster’ button leading directly to the phenocluster view to
explore similar phenotypes (Supplementary Fig. 1).

As shown in Figure 2, the phenocluster view is divided into six
tabs. Each tab is explained in detail with a mouse—over tooltip and
more information can be found within the help pages, where the
data sources are also referenced. The screen center always shows the
phenotypes (or genes) of the current cluster as a graph (or as tabular
list) where edges represent similarity. Nodes are colored according
to taxonomy and cluster membership. Details on each phenotype are
available in tooltips. Graphs can be downloaded in ‘xdot’ and ‘png’
format from the ‘actions and information’ pane.

The different tabs convey the following information: (i) the
overview tab displays the phenotypes of a cluster, i.e. phenotypes
with similar descriptions. The three similarity tabs show cluster
members (or their associated genes) with edges between them (when
surpassing a given threshold), indicating similarity of (ii) phenotype
descriptions (Supplementary Fig. 1), (iii) similar annotations with
GO—terms or (iv) amino acid sequence similarity. (v) The orthology
tab shows only orthologous genes for which their phenotypes have
been clustered together. Thus, functional similarity of these genes
is conﬁrmed twice, by orthology and phenotype. (vi) The PPI view
(Fig. 2) integrates protein interactions and includes an ‘expansion’
feature. Therein, the network of genes of a phenocluster is enriched
by genes interacting with the cluster members. As interacting
proteins often have a similar function and similar phenotype, this
feature allows discovery of missing or novel members of biological
pathways or multiple functions of a gene within a PPI network based
on phenotype similarity.

5 APPLICATIONS

Phenoclusters allow for a variety of different applications. For
instance, users may query PhenomicDB for genes annotated with
a certain disease, and explore their phenoclusters to ﬁnd genes
which have not been associated with this disease so far. The
same approach can be used to study whether genes producing

Fig. 2. Phenocluster of the rippling muscle disease (RMD) phenotype
associated to caveolin 3 (CAV3) visualized with k=3000 for an optimal
view. The cluster was found searching for ‘rippling muscle disease’ in
phenotype descriptions. Genes associated to phenotypes from the cluster
connected by protein interactions are shown (blue nodes). Connected genes
with phenotypes that are not within the cluster (green nodes) and genes
with no phenotypes associated (red nodes) are also shown. The ‘actions
and information’ pane on the right provides statistics, a legend and enables
altering the view. The top section enables changing the presentation of
similarity scores.

a similar phenotype have similar functional annotation. Such an
approach can be particularly important for proteins with lacking or
only very general functional information attached—studying their
phenoclusters will lead to new suggestions on their function.

Another helpful feature is analysis of biological pathways which
are to be inhibited pharmacologically but contain no known
druggable target. Phenoclusters allow searching for yet undiscovered
members of that pathway that are amenable to drug intervention.
As an example, human DAGl has no phenotype described in
PhenomicDB. However, the PPI—phenocluster view of CAV3 (Fig. 2)
is composed of genes of similar phenotypes associated with
‘dystrophi’ (23.3%) and ‘muscular’ (22.6%) as most signiﬁcant
similarity features. Human DAGl through its PPI with CAV3
becomes connected to the mouse ortholog of DAGl which is
associated indeed with a ‘muscular dystrophy’ phenotype, giving
a strong indication also for human DAGl to be involved in such a
phenotype. The usefulness of these approaches is also reported by
others (Washington et al., 2009).

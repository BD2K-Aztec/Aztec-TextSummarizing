ABSTRACT

Motivation: The extraordinary genetic and antigenic variability of
RNA viruses is arguably the greatest challenge to the development
of broadly effective vaccines. No single viral variant can induce
sufficiently broad immunity, and incorporating all known naturally
circulating variants into one multivalent vaccine is not feasible.
Furthermore, no objective strategies currently exist to select actual
viral variants that should be included or excluded in polyvalent
vaccines.

Results: To address this problem, we demonstrate a method
based on graph theory that quantifies the relative importance of
viral variants. We demonstrate our method through application
to the envelope glycoprotein gene of a particularly diverse RNA
virus of pigs: porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus
(PRRSV). Using distance matrices derived from sequence nucleotide
difference, amino acid difference and evolutionary distance, we
constructed viral networks and used common network statistics to
assign each sequence an objective ranking of relative ‘importance’.
To validate our approach, we use an independent published
algorithm to score our top-ranked wild-type variants for coverage
of putative T-cell epitopes across the 9383 sequences in our
dataset. Top-ranked viruses achieve significantly higher coverage
than low-ranked viruses, and top-ranked viruses achieve nearly equal
coverage as a synthetic mosaic protein constructed in silico from the
same set of 9383 sequences.

Conclusion: Our approach relies on the network structure of PRRSV
but applies to any diverse RNA virus because it identifies subsets
of viral variants that are most important to overall viral diversity.
We suggest that this method, through the objective quantification
of variant importance, provides criteria for choosing viral variants
for further characterization, diagnostics, surveillance and ultimately
polyvalent vaccine development.

1 INTRODUCTION

Of all infectious threats to global health, Viruses with RNA genomes
have proven to be the most difﬁcult to control (Cleaveland et al.,
2001; Jones et al., 2008). Viruses such as HIV, inﬂuenza Virus,
hepatitis C Virus and Dengue Virus have deﬁed control in part as
a result of their extraordinary genetic and antigenic variation (Katze
et al., 2008) and their consequent ability to evolve rapidly (Belshaw
et al., 2008; Domingo, 2002; Drake and Holland, 1999; Holmes,
2009). HIV, for example, can evolve into diverse strains within an
individual patient over the course of days or weeks, confounding the
development of vaccines and antivirals and frustrating diagnostics
and surveillance (Crandall, 1999; Gaschen et al., 2002). Thus, the
efﬁcacy of even the most immunogenic vaccines is questionable in
a ﬁeld setting where multiple variants may circulate simultaneously
and where novel variants are continuously evolving. Vaccine
studies almost universally acknowledge this challenge but have
yet to develop objective criteria selecting vaccine candidates that
adequately, yet parsimoniously, capture overall Viral diversity
(Barouch, 2008; Korber et al., 2009).

In an effort to develop vaccines that maximize the representation
of antigenic features present in diverse Viral populations, a series
of computational strategies have been proposed. Driven largely by
HIV vaccine research, the approaches have included concatenating
commonly recognized T—cell epitopes (Palker et al., 1989), creating
pseudoprotein strings of T—cell epitopes (De Groot et al., 2005)
and generating consensus overlapping peptide sets from proteins
(Thomson et al., 2005). Evolutionary approaches such as the
use of consensus sequences (Gao et al., 2004, 2005; Gaschen
et al., 2002), and the most recent common ancestor (MRCA) of
Viral populations, have also been proposed with the assumption
that these approaches capture Viral diversity (Gaschen et al.,
2002). Unfortunately, experimental studies in animal models using
these strategies have documented underwhelming humoral immune
responses (Doria—Rose et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2005).

Ranking viruses for vaccine design

 

The most widely studied approach uses a genetic algorithm to
generate, select and recombine (in silico) potential T—cell epitopes
into full—length ‘mosaic’ protein sequences that can provide greater
coverage of global viral variants than could any single wild—type
protein (Fischer et al., 2007). This mosaic protein approach was able
to achieve between 74% and 87% coverage of HIV—1 Gag sequences,
compared with only between 37% and 67% using a single natural
Gag protein (Fischer et al., 2007). Subsequent experimental studies
have demonstrated that these computationally designed vaccines
augment the breadth and depth of antigen—speciﬁc T—cell responses
as compared with consensus or natural sequence HIV—1 antigens
(Barouch et al., 2010; Santra et al., 2010). However, this approach
yields synthetic peptides with unknown biological properties that
may not be able to be incorporated into a recombinant live vaccine.

Given the need for an objective strategy to select wild—type viral
variants that might be adapted for polyvalent vaccines, we propose
a method based on network analysis. In recent years, interest in the
analysis and modeling of networks has surged outside the traditional
ﬁelds of social science (Wasserman and Faust, 1994; Watts, 2004),
mathematics and computer science (Albert and Barabasi, 2002;
Butts, 2009). Network statistics have proven to be powerful tools for
studying diverse phenomena such as social interactions, connections
among neurons and the structure of the Internet, and for optimizing
solutions to engineering problems (Albert and Barabasi, 2002; Watts,
2004). For our purpose, it has long been recognized that biological
molecules interact directly and indirectly (Yamada and Bork, 2009),
and network statistics have proven fruitful in drug discovery studies
(Azmi et al., 2010; Zhao and Li, 2010), human disease classiﬁcation
(Barabasi et al., 2011; Loscalzo et al., 2007) and functional analyses
of gene regulatory networks (Yu et al., 2007). As such, it is possible
to construct viral networks that explicitly deﬁne the positional
importance of individual viral variants in the network based on
relationships between biomolecules (e. g. Allesina and Pascual,
2008; Salathé et al., 2010; Yamada and Bork, 2009).

In this article, we use a highly diverse and particularly problematic
RNA virus of pigs as a case study: porcine reproductive and
respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV). This exercise provides ‘proof
of concept’ as well as a novel strategy for the control of this virus of
critical importance to agriculture. We present a detailed topological
network analysis that considers the importance of every individual
viral variant i by considering every possible interaction (direct and
indirect) between variant i and j. We use network indices, from local
to global, including node degree, a series of centrality indices and
PageRank, the algorithm at the heart of Google. We then examine
how these indices relate to each other and discuss how to choose
the most appropriate metric for selecting viral variants for study and
to help guide the development of polyvalent vaccines, diagnostic
testing strategies and epidemiological surveillance. Our study makes
minimal initial assumptions about evolutionary processes or viral
biology and can complement other approaches such as the mosaic
protein approach (Fischer et al., 2007) to polyvalent vaccine design.

2 METHODS

2.1 Porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus
PRRSV is the causative agent of porcine reproductive and respiratory

syndrome (PRRS), an economically damaging disease of domestic swine
(Tian et al., 2007; Zimmerman et al., 1997). PRRSV is in the order

Nidovirales, family Arteriviridae, along with equine arteritis virus,
lactate dehydrogenase elevating virus and simian hemorrhagic fever Virus
(Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meulenberg et al., 1993). The virus has a short
(~15 kb), single—stranded, positive—sense RNA genome that encodes at least
nine open reading frames (ORFs; Conzelmann et al., 1993; Meulenberg
et al., 1993). Despite signiﬁcant research, including a focus on the genetic
diversity of the virus, it has remained difﬁcult to control (Shi et al.,
2010a,b). Vaccination, in particular, has variable efﬁcacy and has failed to
reduce transmission or to reduce clinical signs (see Thanawongnuwech and
Suradhat, 2010 and references therein).

One likely cause for the difﬁculty in controlling PRRSV is its genetic
and antigenic variability. Type 1 PRRSV (or European origin) differs at
~50% of nucleic acid positions from Type 2 PRRSV (of North American
origin), implying a high degree of divergence between continents (Forsberg
et al., 2001, 2002; Murtaugh et al., 2010). Furthermore, within these Viral
types, PRRSV exists as a spectrum of genotypes, displaying considerable
heterogeneity with very little geographic population substructure (Shi et al.,
2010a,b; Stadejek et al., 2006). Additionally, PRRSV varies between farms,
herds, among animals within herds and even within individual animals
(Goldberg et al., 2000, 2003). Extensive nucleotide sequence data are
available for the viral ORF5 gene, which is used commonly for phylogenetic
analyses and source tracking (e. g. Shi et al., 2010a,b). Consequently, ORF5
diversity acts as a marker of PRRSV variability.

2.2 Creation of a core PRRSV sequence dataset

All PRRSV ORF5 sequences from isolates in Genbank, the National Center
for Biotechnology Infonnation’s online sequence repository (http://www
.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank/), and the now defunct PRRSV Database were
downloaded in December 2010 (see Supplementary Material for sequence
ﬁles). These sequences comprised 25 265 worldwide samples, 3 live—
attenuated vaccine strains (MLV, ATP and PrimePac) and one laboratory
attenuated strain (Abst—l). Most viruses were from the United States of
America, but viruses from Canada, Mexico, China, Korea, Japan, Thailand,
Austria, Denmark, Italy and Poland were also present.

As a ﬁrst ‘cleaning’ step to ensure we only included wild—type variants,
we removed sequences that were described with any of the following terms:
patent, vaccine, attenuated, attenuation and clone. The remaining sequences
were then aligned using default settings in MUSCLE v3 .6 (Edgar, 2004), with
manual correction in Mesquite (Maddison and Maddison, 2011). At the same
time, we removed all type 1 variants, thus restricting our analyses to type 2
PRRSV. The remaining aligned sequences underwent a redundancy analysis
within the computer program Mothur (Schloss et al., 2009), and identical
sequences were removed. In addition, to avoid bias in subsequent network
and phylogenetic analyses (Lemmon et al., 2009), we removed sequences
with any nucleotide base ambiguities. The next ﬁltering step was to remove
poor quality data using three criteria: ﬁrst, sequences were removed if they
did not have a start and a stop codon; second, sequences were removed if
> 1% of the gene sequence was missing; and third, a sequence was removed
if it produced an insertion or deletion in the alignment that was biologically
implausible (e.g. causing a frame shift and introducing premature stop
codons) or occurred in fewer than 0.005% of sequences. The alignment was
then screened for evidence of recombination using 3Seq (Boni et al., 2007,
2010), with all putative recombinants subject to secondary screening and
validation using RDP3 (Martin et al., 2010): if identiﬁed by three or more
methods within the software, sequences were removed from further analysis.
For reference, even though some were eliminated in our ﬁltering process,
we included several common reference strains: VR2332, RespPRRS, China
‘atypical’, J A—142, MN—184, PrimePac and ATP viral variants. This process
resulted in a set of 9383 non—identical ORF5 sequences that represent the
full extent of known genetic diversity of wild—type type 2 PRRSV.

2.3 Construction of PRRSV networks

We constructed three undirected, unweighted networks using adjacency
matrices derived from (i) nucleotide sequence differences, (ii) amino acid

sequence differences and (iii) evolutionary distances. We generated the
nucleotide difference adjacency matrix using PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford, 2003),
with cells containing values representing uncorrected numbers of nucleotide
differences between pairs of aligned sequences. Similarly, we generated a
second adjacency matrix by calculating the uncorrected number of changes
between amino acid sequences using program R (Team, 2010) with the APE
(Paradis et al., 2004) and SeqinR packages (Charif and Lobry, 2007). Our
third adjacency matrix represented evolutionary distances. Values in cells
were patristic distances (distances along the branches of a phylogenetic tree)
calculated by PAUP* 4.0 (Swofford, 2003): we built the phylogeny used
to calculate these distances using RAxML 7.2.8 (Stamatakis, 2006, 2008)
maximum likelihood analyses on the CIPRES Science Gateway (Miller et al.,
2010). We implemented a General—Time—Reversible nucleotide substitution
model with four categories of gamma distributed rate heterogeneity and a
proportion of invariant sites (GTR +I‘+ 1) model of molecular evolution.

The three matrices represent different types of biological relationships
among viral sequences. The ﬁrst makes the fewest assumption about
the structure or function of each variant, the second acknowledges that
immunological cross—protection and virulence operate at the level of
proteins, and the third acknowledges that evolutionary history might be
an important constraint on viral immunobiology. Although these matrices
contain quantitative information on relationships between viral variants, to
simplify theory and measurement, we dichotomized each using the sna
package in R (Butts, 2008). This approach is appropriate given that the
relationship under study, in this instance genetic distance, is stable and the
values taken across pairs are constrained (Butts, 2009).

2.4 Topological indices used to describe
positional importance

To rank sequences, we used a range of indices that are dependent on the
characteristics of the focal node and also included information about the
overall topology of the viral network.

The most fundamental metric, the degree (or connectivity; k) of a
sequence, describes the number of links a sequence makes with other
sequences. Those sequences with high degrees are those that are connected
highly with all other sequences. This index is useful for identifying Viral
variants that have the most direct connections to other variants. Other,
secondary, clustering techniques further detail the relative importance of each
sequence to ‘sequence diversity space’ and include closeness; betweenness;
eigenvector centrality; and PageRank.

Closeness provides a measure that describes the position, in terms of
distance, from a focal sequence to all other sequences and is measured as:

1
(CC(V)= —Zuevd(vvu)) (1)

Intuitively, closeness provides an index of the extent to which a given
sequence has short paths to all other sequences. This is a measure of whether a
sequence is in the ‘middle’ of our deﬁned sequence space; smaller values can
be interpreted to indicate sequences of greater importance (i.e. the removal
of such a sequence will affect a majority of other sequences).

Betweenness, ﬁrst introduced by Freeman (1977), is a measure that
describes the centrality of a sequence, provided as a frequency with which a
sequence is located on the shortest path between all other sequences. First,
let 85,02) denote the pairwise dependency or the fraction of shortest paths
between s and t that pass through v. Following this, the betweenness of virus

v is deﬁned as:
B(v)=Z#v#tevasxv) (2)

Conceptually, high—betweenness sequences lie on a large number of non—
redundant shortest paths between other vertices; they may be thought of
as ‘bridges’. This metric has been used to assess node importance in other
biological networks (Yamada and Bork, 2009), to describe sexual contact
networks (Liljeros et al., 2001) and to describe the structure of the worldwide
air transportation network (Guimera et al., 2005).

Eigenvector centrality, as described by Bonacich (1972), determines node
scores that correspond to the leading eigenvector of the sequence adjacency
matrix. These scores arise from a reciprocal process in which the centrality of
each sequence is proportional to the sum of the centralities of those sequences
to which it is connected. The deﬁning equation is as follows:

xszw (3)

where A is the adjacency matrix of the graph, A is the constant (the
eigenvalue) and w is the eigenvector. In general, sequences that have high
eigenvector centralities are those that are connected to many other sequences
that are, in turn, connected to many others. This metric has been widely
used to identify key network components, including connectivity within the
human brain (Lohmann et 01., 2010).

PageRank, in the context in which we use it, rates viral variants as
important if they receive links from other viruses that are in turn also rated as
important. Each virus i is assigned an importance, and each link al-j (exiting
virus i to enter virus j) carries an equal fraction of the importance value:
the importance of the virus is then the sum of the importance assigned to its
incoming connections. This recursive problem is solved by building a matrix
S in which each element represents the fraction of importance assigned to
a link: subsequently, importance is solved by computing the eigenvector
associated with the dominant eigenvalue of the matrix (Bryan and Leise,
2006).

Finally, we analyze the community structure of the networks by computing
the modularity Q given by (Clauset et al., 2004):

Q=Z(e.-.-—a,-2) (4)
i=1

where m is the number of modules inside the network, eil- is the fraction of
links in the network connecting nodes of the same community i and al- is the
fraction of links that have one or two ends inside community i. The larger
the fraction of links inside each community, the higher the value of Q. In
this way, modularity Q can be taken as a reference parameter to ﬁnd the
optimal community divisions based on the topology of the network. These
algorithms have been used extensively to address interaction patterns within
varied systems, including but not limited to American football (Girvan and
Newman, 2002), and plant—pollinator dynamics (Olesen et 01., 2007).

The critical concept to note in the above analytical approach is that the
position a sequence takes within ‘sequence diversity space’ is determined
by its similarity to other sequences and the similarity values of the other
sequences to which it is connected. In using these algorithms, we account for
the underlying structure of the genetic relationships between sequences and
can objectively rank each sequence and its contribution to PRRSV genetic
diversity.

2.5 Relationship between indices

We calculated the indices described above for every individual viral variant
in each PRRSV network. We ranked the importance of all variants according
to their values of a particular index. Thus, in total there were ﬁve rankings
corresponding to ﬁve different indices (i.e. k, CC, B, w and PR) for each of
three networks. We also examined whether or not different indices provided
the same information about the relative importance of viral variants. First, to
show the relationship between indices, we conducted hierarchical clustering
on the rankings of the viral variants by the values of the ﬁve indices: ﬁrst,
we standardized the values within indices and then used similarity measures
appropriate for interval data. Second, we used Kendall rank correlations
between all pairs of indices; and third, we applied a Kendall Concordance
test to determine whether the observed ranks were signiﬁcantly different
from those expected by chance when independently ranking 93 83 nodes by
ﬁve indices.

2.6 Design and evaluation of T-cell vaccine candidates

We compared the putative epitope coverage of known PRRSV variants by
generating vaccine ‘mosaic’ proteins using a promising design algorithm

Ranking viruses for vaccine design

 

from the HIV literature (Fischer et al., 2007). To assess whether high—ranking
variants achieved better epitope coverage than low—ranking variants, we used
the Vaccine Epitope Coverage Assessment online tool (Epicover; Thurmond
et al., 2008) to compute how well the top— and bottom—ranked proteins
from each network covered putative epitopes across the full dataset of 9383
wild—type PRRSV sequences. To further explore the association between
network ranking and epitope coverage, we ranked sequences according to
each centrality metric, selected every 20th ranked sequence and calculated
its epitope coverage. We quantiﬁed the strength of association using MIC
(Reshef et al., 2011) and Pearson’s correlation coefﬁcient (,0). To compare
our method to the mosaic protein approach (Thurmond et al., 2008), we
used the Mosaic Vaccine Designer online tool to generate in silico a single
mosaic protein from the 9383 wild—type sequences. We then used Epicover
to measure the coverage of this single mosaic across the 9383 wild—type
sequences.

3 RESULTS

The viral network derived from nucleotide differences included 9383
variants and had 88040689 potential links of which 11044560
were realized, resulting in a connectance of 0.125. The amino acid—
derived network included 7889 variants and had 62 236 321 potential
links of which 8 636 124 were realized, resulting in a connectance of
0.139. The remaining network, derived from evolutionary distances,
included 9383 viral variants with 11005086 realized links, with
a resultant value of connectance of 0.125. Measured in this way,
connectance is the average fraction of viral variants to which an
individual variant in the network is connected based on similarity.
Twenty—two viral variants were ranked in the top 100 sequences in
all three networks, and 51 variants were ranked in the bottom 100
sequences in all three networks.

All three viral networks displayed cumulative degree distributions
that were different from what would be expected if the link
distribution were random. Each network had data consistent with
an exponential degree distribution [P(k) ~exp(—yk): nucleotide
AICc = —8449.9; evolutionary distance AICc = —7637.8; amino
acid AICc = —6191.2]. The data were not well represented
by the power law [P(k) elk—V: nucleotide AICc = —1246.5;

evolutionary distance AICc = — 1417.4; amino acid AICc = —816. 1]
or truncated power law [P(k) ~ k‘y exp(—k/kx): nucleotide AICc =
—8171.8; evolutionary distance AICc = —1410.9; amino acid
AICc=—5847.8]. The identity of the best—ﬁt model is secondary
to our data departing from a power—law distribution; this suggests
that very highly connected variants are more rare than would be
expected if the networks were built using a scale—free distribution
to describe the number of interactions per virus.

There were differences in the rankings of viral variants by the
ﬁve different indices (for select sequence rankings, see Table 1).
Qualitatively, there were differences in the information provided by
the indices rankings of variants based on the hierarchical clustering
dendrograms (Fig. 1). These dendrograms were insensitive to the
clustering method. The more similar indices are in their ranking of
the variants, the shorter the distance between the branch representing
them and the ﬁrst shared branching point. Nevertheless, the rank
orderings of variants were statistically signiﬁcantly correlated
between indices [i.e. a variant ranked highly by degree (k) tended
also to receive a high ranking as measured by eigenvector centrality;
Table 2]. This was further validated using Kendall’s W, which
showed that the ranking provided by each index is signiﬁcantly
similar across each viral network: nucleotide differences (W = 0.82,
X2=38421, P<0.01); amino acid differences (W=0.85, X2:
33495, P <0.01) and evolutionary distance (W = 0.798, X2 = 37447,
P <0.01).

Our ranking approach indentiﬁed a single wild—type sequence
that achieved coverage of putative epitopes essentially equal to
that of a ‘mosaic’ protein generated using all 9383 sequences
(Fig. 2). Our top—ranked variant (DQ475317) within the nucleotide
network achieved 48.5% coverage, whereas the mosaic protein
achieved 49%. Top—ranking variants consistently covered more
putative epitopes than those that were ranked poorly: the top—
ranking amino acid variant achieved 40% coverage; and the most
important variant in the evolutionary distance network achieved
41% coverage (Fig. 2). The 22 variants ranked in the top 100
of all three networks achieved, on average, 43% (:l:1.7% SD)
coverage of putative epitopes derived from known PRRSV ORF5

all three networks achieved, on average, only 26% (:l:3.5% SD).
This difference was statistically signiﬁcant (i=28.20; 69 degrees
of freedom; P <0.0001). There was a signiﬁcant (P <0.0001)
relationship between network ranking and putative epitope coverage
when variants were ranked by degree (Fig. 3: ,0=—0.76; MIC =
0.63); closeness (,0 = —0.78; MIC = 0.61); betweenness (,0 = —0.66;
MIC = 0.52); PageRank (,0 = —0.65; MIC = 0.47) and eigenvector
centrality (,0: —0.59; MIC = 0.53).

4 DISCUSSION

Our results demonstrate that a dataset of 9383 sequences could
be ranked according to three matrices and ﬁve network centrality
metrics. Using interaction networks derived from sequence
nucleotide difference, amino acid difference and evolutionary
distance, we were able to score individual PRRSV sequences based
on their relative importance to the viral network. This yielded
22 sequences that were represented in the top 100 sequences
in all matrices and provided objective criteria for selecting viral
variants for polyvalent vaccine design. We identiﬁed a single
wild—type sequence that covered 48% of putative epitopes derived
from the known diversity of PRRSV Furthermore, we document

a relationship between our ranked variants and putative epitope
coverage. In summary, we have demonstrated that it is possible to
use network statistics to rank viruses with respect to their overall
‘importance’ within a network and that the resulting rankings can
help guide the selection of viruses for inclusion in vaccines.

The key insight provided by our work is that it is possible
to construct de novo a virus network from sequence data and
objectively quantify the positional importance of viral variants
within such a network. For vaccine development, it is clear
that choosing a single variant as a type strain is problematic,
and vaccination with all known viral variants is not technically
feasible. Consequently, there is a need for techniques that ‘ﬁlter’
highly diverse genomic datasets and select representative sequences
for further study. We suggest that the calculation of network
indices that describe the relative importance of viral variants
may inform decisions about type strain selection and polyvalent
vaccine development. Although this approach is ﬂexible and can
be implemented using small and less diverse genomic data, more
traditional approaches may be more appropriate in these situations.
Of the indices we measured, eigenvector centrality provided a robust
prediction of variant importance. This metric provides a measure
of a viral variant’s global position, rather than its sheer number
of connections (i.e. k), and describes sequences that are highly
connected and fall within densely populated substructures of the
viral network. More generally, our case study of the PRRSV system
serves as an illustration of the potential of these techniques in the
objective selection of important viral variants for additional study.

We demonstrate that it is possible to select only highly ranked
sequences and achieve equal or better coverage of putative T—cell
epitopes than using low—ranked sequences and that top—ranked
sequences achieve nearly as good T—cell epitope coverage as
artiﬁcial mosaic proteins derived computationally from the full set
or sequences. The latter conclusion is important because mosaic

evolutionary distance network; and (iv) a mosaic protein generated from
all 9383 sequences. The ‘mosaic’ sequence was generated by the genetic
algorithm described in Fischer et al. (2007); all sequences, including the
mosaic protein, were compared against all nine—mers generated from 9383
unique PRRSV variants.

proteins derived from the aforementioned algorithm may, when
synthesized, have biological properties that render them unsuitable
for inclusion in actual vaccines (Fischer et al., 2007; Nickle et al.,
2007; Rolland et al., 2007). Our method achieves nearly equal
coverage by identifying the ‘most important’ wild—type viruses.
These viruses, if they can be found in reference collections, would
make excellent candidates for sub sequent biological studies, with the
goal of modifying their immunomodulatory properties and virulence
to the point that they would be suitable vaccine candidates. Our
results predict that such vaccines would be biologically viable while
also conferring broadly cross—protective immunity.

Our approach is likely to be useful given the extraordinarily large
amounts of data currently available as a result of next—generation
sequencing technologies (Holmes and Grenfell, 2009). Although
existing computational methods to account for viral diversity are
powerful when investigating small numbers of sequences, the size
of potential tree space and computational complexity increases faster
than exponentially with the number of sequences (Holmes and
Grenfell, 2009; Rambaut et al., 2008). This forces use of biology—
independent ﬁlters (e. g. limiting analysis to geographic regions,
considering ease—of—access to samples or using well—characterized
genes) to produce a dataset that is manageable. At the other
extreme, there is a growing recognition that the use of consensus
sequences, although computationally efﬁcient, may not capture the
evolutionary dynamics or phenotypic variation necessary to generate
immunogenetic and broadly effective vaccines (Aaskov et al., 2006;
Wahala et al., 2010). Our approach provides a way of ‘distilling’
this overwhelming diversity and focusing subsequent analyses on
a small and objectively chosen subset of viral variants. Although
biases may be introduced to the genetic networks due to limitations
in source data, our approach is fully adaptable to sample sets with

Network ranking

epitopes. Coverage of nine—mers in porcine reproductive and respiratory
syndrome virus by a ranked subset of ORF5 viral variants. Viral variants were

different or no biases, such as geographically restricted populations,
or to virulent populations of viruses. Notably, our network analyses
were conducted and completed in 72 h on a standard 2 GHz desktop
computer with 8 GB of RAM. This suggests that our framework is
not prohibitive from a computational perspective.

We suggest that network centrality measures, in differentiating
viral variants according to how inﬂuential they are, can inform the
selection of type strains for vaccine design. The degree, k, of a node
is the ﬁrst indication of its centrality; intuitively, a well—connected
sequence with a high degree will be traversed by a proportionally
larger number of short paths than those sequences with low degrees.
However, it is important to distinguish this metric as a local index; it
does not take in to account the importance of the neighboring nodes.
This suggests that a variant, although well connected, may fall within
a relatively sparse area of the network and may not account for a
large amount of genetic information. To overcome this restriction,
the other centrality indices quantify positional importance using
global measures accounting for genetic distance (i.e. the number
of edges on the shortest path connecting i and j). Eigenvector
centrality is particularly useful; previous research has suggested that
nodes characterized by higher eigenvector centrality play a more
inﬂuential role in the structure and dynamics of the networks in
which they are nested (Allesina and Pascual, 2008, 2009). In our
viral networks, those variants that have high eigenvector centrality
scores are those that contribute disproportionately to global viral
diversity, acting as core variants that are likely to prove useful in
the development of vaccines, diagnostic tests and epidemiological
surveillance strategies.

Another potential metric that provides insight into variant
selection is the betweenness of a sequence. One biological
interpretation of this index is that it quantiﬁes the probability that

node i represents an intermediate step in the evolution between
one sequence to another. In Table 2, we demonstrated a positive
correlation between sequence degree and sequence betweenness,
conﬁrming the intuitive idea that sequences of high degree are
those with high betweenness: the larger the number of neighbors a
particular sequence has, the greater the probability that the sequence
will fall on a shortest path between other sequences. Deviations from
this correlation indicate ‘gatekeeper’ sequences, i.e. sequences that
represent unique pathways to subsections within the network. Thus,
using this metric, we are able to quantify a variant’s importance in
two ways: ﬁrst, a variant that has a high betweenness score provides
a measure of the amount of genetic information which the variant
controls; and second, if a variant falls outside of the correlation we
document, it represents a unique sequence that acts as a bridge to
distinct modules within the viral network.

Our rankings of PRRSV reference variants reveal that many
studies of PRRSV biology to date have focused on reference strains
that are not central to the diversity of the virus. Typically, such
reference strains are selected because of ease—of—access, publication
history and evaluation of whether the variant represents a particular
geographic location or biological property (e.g. virulence and
immunogenicity). Our analysis shows that selection of such strains
may limit the generality of subsequent conclusions. Additionally,
current phylogenetic methods that attempt to classify type strains
(Shi et al., 2010a,b), although analytically rigorous, carry a series
of assumptions that introduce biases into variant selection. This is
particularly true in PRRSV, where incomplete geographic sampling
and a reliance on a gene for inference that is subject to strong
immunological pressure has likely resulted in phylogenetic trees that
are suboptimal (Murtaugh et al., 2010). Given these weaknesses
and the failings of current classiﬁcation strategies (see Murtaugh
et al., 2010 and references therein), we suggest that deﬁning variant
importance via network statistics is a promising and productive
avenue. Indeed, this approach is best suited for PRRSV and
other viruses with a large amount of genetic diversity and little
phylogenetic substructure. In the case of viruses that sort into clear
monophyletic clades, it may be impossible to select one variant that
represents diversity across clades. In this situation, we suggest a
ranking system based on speciﬁc scenarios, such as geographically
restricted populations, virulent populations of viruses or, as in our
case study, the selection of known subtypes. An alternate solution
is to select sequences from within deﬁned network groups using
modularity—based clustering heuristics (see Newman, 2012 and
references therein).

One strength of our approach is that it makes minimal assumptions
about viral biology in assigning the rankings of individual
sequences. Underlying matrices of amino acid similarity, for
example, do not assign immunological importance to speciﬁc protein
regions. However, our approach is very ﬂexible for incorporating
biological information as it is generated. For example, our approach
could easily be applied to speciﬁc protein regions that future
studies identify as being immunologically important. A weakness,
however, is that the representational framework is restrictive given
the dyadic nature of interactions; if our goal is to develop an
effective vaccine, this process may omit components of what is a
complex system of interactions. Indeed, research in the HIV ﬁeld has
revealed that induction of protective immunity is a function of robust
mucosal immunity, high avidity and polyfunctional T—cells, broad
neutralizing antibodies and optimized vaccine delivery methods

(Wijesundara et al., 2011). This is in addition to the difﬁculties
associated with viral antigenic diversity (Fischer et al., 2007).
However, decades of research have been unsuccessful in the
development of broadly effective vaccines for numerous highly
variable pathogens. Thus, our approach to representing variability
as a network, and ranking variants for further study, may prove to
be a judicious strategy that aids in the development of efﬁcacious
vaccines and targeted control.

Important tasks for future studies include: (i) improving our
knowledge of the biological meanings of different centrality
indices; (ii) extending and improving the ranking system through
comparative analyses of similar viruses; and (iii) testing whether
the high—ranking individual variants are better in inducing cross—
protective immunity than those with lower rankings in viva.
Furthermore, a potential and as yet unrealized application of our
approach is the targeted design of vaccines that modify virulence.
Our case study incorporated all sequence variation, but it is possible
to select for analysis only sequences of high virulence. Vaccines
rarely provide full protection from disease, and those vaccines that
are ineffective may unintentionally select for increased pathogen
virulence (Gandon et al., 2001). We posit that, given the high
likelihood that any vaccine against a highly variable RNA virus such
as PRRSV would offer less—than—perfect protection, an alternative
goal of vaccination could be to drive viral evolution intentionally
toward benignness. Our ranking method could provide rational
criteria for selecting among highly virulent types to include in
vaccines that may, over time, drive the population of viruses toward
lower virulence (Ewald, 2004).

ABSTRACT

Summary: MicroRNAs (miRNAs) represent an important class of small
non-coding RNAs regulating gene expression in eukaryotes. Present
algorithms typically rely on genomic data to identify miRNAs and
require extensive installation procedures. Niche model organisms
lacking genomic sequences cannot be analyzed by such tools. Here
we introduce the MIRPIPE application enabling rapid and simple
browser-based miRNA homology detection and quantification.
MIRPIPE features automatic trimming of raw RNA-Seq reads originat-
ing from various sequencing instruments, processing of isomiRs and
quantiﬁcation of detected miRNAs versus public- or user-uploaded
reference databases.

Availability and implementation: The Web service is freely available
at http://bioinformatics.mpi-bn.mpg.de. MIRPIPE was implemented in
Perl and integrated into Galaxy. An offline version for local execution is
also available from our Web site.

1 INTRODUCTION

MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are ~22 nucleotides long and belong to
the class of snRNAs. miRNAs serve numerous roles in
downregulation (transcript degradation and sequestering, trans-
lational suppression) of gene expression. In general, miRNAs
are assumed to regulate multiple targets although effects on
most targets are relatively mild (Ameres and Zamore, 2013).
Isoforms of miRNAs resulting from imperfect digestion by
Drosha and Dicer or RNA editing by specialized enzymes rep-
resent a challenge during the determination of correct read
counts following RNASeq. miRNA variants might be ‘silent’
(3’ modiﬁcation = isomiR) or target different mRNAs when
changes occur in the 5’ regions responsible for complementary
binding. Sequence differences between taxa hamper quantiﬁca-
tion, especially if no genomic or miRNA data for the studied
organism are available as in the case of niche model organisms.
Sequencing errors can further complicate the identiﬁcation
of miRNAs. These effects should ideally be addressed on

multiple levels, including (i) isomiR handling, (ii) enforcement
of a minimum read copy number, (iii) clustering of similar
miRNAs, (iv) removal of relatively low abundance reads and
(v) optional fallback to the miRNA family level. A set of appli-
cations in the ﬁeld attempts to cover these features, but a
Web-based tool able to unify all functionalities that can be
applied to any organism is critically missing (An et al., 2013;
Giurato et al., 2013; Wen et al., 2012).

2 WORKFLOW AND FEATURES

MIRPIPE uses open-source binary tools including the FASTX—
Toolkit (Pearson et al., 1997), Cutadapt (Martin, 2011) and
BLASTN (Boratyn et al., 2013) for data processing. The pipeline
was integrated into a Galaxy-based Web platform (Goecks et al.,
2010) but is also available for download and local execution.
A detailed explanation of the algorithm can be found in
Supplementary File S1.

The workﬂow starts with the upload of a compressed F ASTQ/
FASTA read ﬁle using the Web interface or the MIRPIPE FTP
server. MIRPIPE can fully process raw reads originating from
Illumina, 454, IonTorrent or Sanger sequencing instruments
including adapter trimming. A reference F ASTA database bear-
ing mature target miRNAs can either be selected from current
miRBase release (Grifﬁths-J ones et al., 2006) or can be uploaded
by the user.

The raw reads are processed to optionally remove an adapter
sequence and trim for a minimum quality (default Q20). Only
reads of the desired size range are selected to limit the pool to
mature miRNAs. Duplicate reads are collapsed to decrease the
number of necessary homology searches, and only those
sequences represented by a minimum count are kept for further
analyses. This measure is intended to remove unique reads,
which frequently denote sequencing errors or miRNA variations
that are expressed near to the detection limit, preventing reliable
quantiﬁcation.

Read counts from isomiRs of the same miRNA are combined.
These isomiR read sequences may only differ by the 3’ end and
are thus putatively encoded by the same gene. Only one nucleo-
tide may differ between two sequences to be counted as isoforms
of the same miRNA, and only the longest sequence is used
in the next step to further reduce the amount of homology
searches.

The remaining read sequences are used for a sequence similar-
ity search versus the chosen reference database of miRNAs.

Mature reference miRNAs and their precursors are optionally
collated by name on the family level to remove redundancy

03) Spearman correlation of absolute counts of GS and MIRPIPE. (C)
The large number of GS-speciﬁc miRNA identiﬁcations is caused by low
counts, ﬁltered out by MIRPIPE default parameters

introduced by organism preﬁxes and precursor sufﬁxes (e.g. bta—
miR-200a, oan-miR—200a—3p > miR-200a).

For each read, the detected reference miRNA families are
scored based on the minimum number of mismatches. If a
read matched equally well versus multiple miRNA families, the
respective families are joined by single linkage clustering. This
permits the inclusion of reads that cannot be matched uniquely,
as well as the exact measurement of the fraction of ambiguously
matching reads and thereby the reliability of the match. By
default, only those read sequences that are at least 5% as abun-
dant as the most abundant sequence per miRNA family cluster
are denoted to reduce the impact of sequencing errors and in-
crease robustness.

Counts per miRNA family and cluster are presented for down-
load. Currently, MIRPIPE can complete a job within 0.5—2 h,
depending on the ﬁle size and the selected reference database.
MIRPIPE quantiﬁcation results can be directly used for differ-
ential expression analysis using other tools on our Web site
(Supplementary File S1).

3 BENCHMARK

To demonstrate congruent results for MIRPIPE, we compared
the results with an miRNA analysis based on a genomic mapping
of Illumina HiSeq reads (Lawless et al., 2013). We identiﬁed
96% of the published miRNAs (Supplementary File S2).
Furthermore, we compared our tool with a similar approach
without the need for a genome sequence by analyzing a public
dataset (Zhang et al., 2013) with the CLC Genomics Workbench.
In this case, 84% of the miRNAs were identical (Supplementary
File S2).

Finally, we checked the predictive efﬁciency of our tool for
niche models based on a human RNA-Seq dataset (Lappalainen
et al., 2013). Here, we performed MIRPIPE versus a reference
database bearing (i) the complete miRBase, (ii) miRBase exclud-
ing human miRNAs and (iii) miRBase excluding miRNAs of all
primates. The absence of closely related reference sequences
resulted in only a marginal loss of sensitivity for MIRPIPE,
indicating its aptitude for the analysis of niche model organisms
(Fig. 1, Supplementary File S2).

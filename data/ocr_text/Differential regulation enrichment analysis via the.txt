ABSTRACT

Motivation: Although many gene set analysis methods have been
proposed to explore associations between a phenotype and a group
of genes sharing common biological functions or involved in the same
biological process, the underlying biological mechanisms of identified
gene sets are typically unexplained.

Results: We propose a method called Differential Regulation-based
enrichment Analysis for GENe sets (DRAGEN) to identify gene sets in
which a significant proportion of genes have their transcriptional regu-
latory patterns changed in a perturbed phenotype. We conduct com-
prehensive simulation studies to demonstrate the capability of our
method in identifying differentially regulated gene sets. We further
apply our method to three human microarray expression datasets,
two with hormone treated and control samples and one concerning
different cell cycle phases. Results indicate that the capability of
DRAGEN in identifying phenotype-associated gene sets is significantly
superior to those of four existing methods for analyzing differentially
expressed gene sets. We conclude that the proposed differential regu-
lation enrichment analysis method, though exploratory in nature, com-
plements the existing gene set analysis methods and provides a
promising new direction for the interpretation of gene expression data.

1 INTRODUCTION

With the maturation of high-throughput techniques such as
DNA microarrays (Duggan et al., 1999) and RNA sequencing
(RNA-seq) Wang et al., 2009) in gene expression proﬁling on a
genome-wide scale, interpretations of the vast amount of gene
expression data have now become a standard task in biological
studies (Cookson et al., 2009; Dixon et al., 2007). As a typical
example, genes differentially expressed in normal and cancer
samples are often identified as associated with the cancer of inter-
est, thereby providing clues for finding biomarkers and drug

targets for the diagnosis and treatment of the cancer (Nevins
and Potti, 2007).

Nevertheless, a biological function is usually raised by the col-
laborative effects of multiple gene products instead of individual
proteins. With this understanding, methods have been proposed
to find or rank sets of differentially expressed genes, forming the
research direction of gene set analysis (Goeman and Buhlmann,
2007). To mention a few, Subramanian et al. (2005) proposed a
method called GSEA (Gene Set Enrichment Analysis) to detect
pre-defined gene sets that are enriched with differentially ex-
pressed genes based on a weighted Kolmogorov—Smirnov statis-
tic. Breitling et al. (2004) put forward a method called Over-
Representation Analysis (ORA) to determine which part of a
gene set is differentially expressed by making use of the hyper-
geometrical distribution. Barry et al. (2005) relied on a permu-
tation approach to prioritize gene sets that are composed of a
large proportion of marginally differential expressed genes and
named their method Significance Analysis of Function and
Expression (SAFE).

Although the earlier methods are capable of providing a list of
differentially expressed gene sets from a collection of pre-defined
candidates, two important questions remain largely untouched in
the gene set analysis literature. First, how to take regulatory re-
lationships between genes in a candidate gene set into consider-
ation? Second, what is the reason behind the observation that a
gene set is differentially expressed? To answer the first question,
several network-based methods have been proposed in the litera-
ture. For example, netGSA adopted a mixed linear model to test
the signiﬁcance of gene sets (Shojaie and Michailidis, 2009). Gene
Graph Enrichment Analysis (GGEA) detected consistency be-
tween transcriptional regulatory relationships and gene expres-
sion levels by using a Petri net with fuzzy logic (Geistlinger et al.,
2011). PA thway Recognition Algorithm using Data Integration on
Genomic Models (PARADIGM) incorporated pathway inter-
actions as well as many types of omics data to infer activities
of pathways in patients Waske et al., 2010). Diﬂerential
Expression Analysis for Pathways (DEAP) was capable of detect-
ing paths in input pathways with the most differential expression
(Haynes et al., 2013). These methods addressed the first question
by taking regulatory relationships (or interactions) between genes
into consideration, but left the second question unanswered.

The expression of a gene is a complicated process regulated by
several factors, among which transcription factors (TFs) play a

crucial role. Therefore, the change of the expression level of a
gene in an abnormal phenotype may mainly be attributed to the
alteration of the gene’s transcriptional regulatory pattern (Cheng
et al., 2012). It has been reported that such alterations in tran-
scriptional regulation, usually initiated by mechanisms such as
genetic and epigenetic modiﬁcations, are often observed among
abnormal phenotypes including the vast categories of cancers.
For example, mutations occurring in TFs can lead to retargeting
on the promoters of speciﬁc oncogenes in breast cancer (Zuo
et al., 2007). Mutations occurring in the promoter region of
the telomerase enzyme-coding gene can drive the development
of melanoma (Patton and Harrington, 2013). More generally,
TF-encoding genes with chromosomal translocations have been
distinguished, resulting in mistargeting and transcriptional dys-
regulation among cancers (Patel et al., 2012). Furthermore, by
investigating transcriptional regulatory networks constructed for
different cell lines with ChIP-seq experiments, it has been reported
that a large proportion of regulatory interactions vary across dif-
ferent phenotypes (Neph et al., 2012). However, such signiﬁcant
alterations in transcriptional regulation, which typically occur in
speciﬁc cellular environments in response to stimuli accompany-
ing abnormal phenotypes, can hardly be identiﬁed and explained
by the traditional analysis of differential expression patterns of
the genes involved. Indeed, in order to capture subtle changes of
transcriptional regulatory patterns in abnormal phenotypes, a
novel computational approach beyond the traditional identiﬁca-
tion of differentially expressed genes or gene sets is required.

With the above motivation, we propose to connect the
observed expression levels of a set of genes with their underlying
transcriptional regulatory patterns and further detect alterations
in the regulatory relationships from gene expression data.
Speciﬁcally, we achieve this goal by putting forward an approach
called Diﬂerential Regulation based enrichment Analysis for GENe
sets (DRAGEN) that integrates gene expression data and a tran-
scriptional regulatory network to identify differentially regulated
gene sets. DRAGEN uses a linear regression model to explain the
relationship between the expression level of a target gene and that
of a TF, thereby connecting regulatory patterns between TFs and
target genes to their expression proﬁles. With this rigorous stat-
istical model, DRAGEN converts the problem of detecting dif-
ferentially regulated gene sets to a series of hypothesis testing
problems followed by the fusion of multiple P—values to obtain
the statistical signiﬁcance of each candidate gene set, thereby
enabling the ranking of the candidates. We conduct comprehen-
sive simulation experiments to demonstrate the superior perform-
ance of DRAGEN, apply it to an estradiol—treated MCF-7 cell
line, an androgen-treated LNCaP cell line and a HeLa cell line at
different cell cycle phases, and show the capability of this method
in ﬁnding gene sets associated with relevant phenotypes.

2 METHODS
2.1 Principles of DRAGEN

The basic premise of this study is that the transcriptional regulatory re-
lationship between a TF and a target gene regulated by the TF may
exhibit different patterns in different phenotypic states, and such an al-
teration in the regulatory relationship can be detected using gene expres-
sion proﬁles of the TF and the target gene. Moreover, for a set of genes
that are involved in the biological process underlying a phenotype,

regulatory patterns of a signiﬁcant proportion of the genes would be
altered when a perturbation is applied to the biological process.
Therefore, given a pre—deﬁned gene set, one can quantify the strength
of association between the gene set and a phenotype by introducing a
perturbation to the phenotype (e.g. treat samples with drugs) and then
measuring whether the regulatory patterns in the set of genes change
signiﬁcantly. Besides, given a phenotype and a collection of candidate
gene sets (e.g. pathways), one can identify gene sets that are most likely
related to the phenotype by ranking the candidate gene sets according to
their strength of association with the phenotype. We refer to such studies
based on the detection of alterations in regulatory relationships as differ-
ential regulation enrichment analysis.

On the basis of the above rationale, we propose an approach called
DRAGEN to detect alterations in regulatory patterns in a perturbed
phenotype. As illustrated in Figure l, DRAGEN takes as input three
data sources: a transcriptional regulatory network where each edge indi-
cates the regulatory relationship between a regulatory gene and its target,
a collection of pre—deﬁned candidate gene sets and gene expression pro-
ﬁles for the normal and perturbed phenotypes. With these input,
DRAGEN performs differential regulation enrichment analysis and pro-
duces a ranked list of the candidate gene sets as the output. More spe-
ciﬁcally, for each gene set, DRAGEN carries out the following four steps
to calculate a score that indicates the statistical signiﬁcance of differential
regulation in the gene set. First, the gene set is mapped onto the tran-
scriptional regulatory network, resulting in a sub-network corresponding
to the gene set. In this procedure, we by default require the inclusion of
both the TFs and targets in a gene set. Alternatively, one can relax this
constraint and require a gene set to include only target genes. Second,
each edge in the sub-network is ﬁtted into two linear regression models
with the use of the gene expression data for the normal and perturbed
phenotypes, respectively, and a P—value indicating the degree of difference
between the two models is calculated. Third, P—values for all edges in the
gene set are combined by using the Fisher’s method, and a statistic for the
gene set is obtained. Fourth, a permutation procedure is applied to cal-
culate a P—value indicating the degree of differential regulation of the gene
set. With P—values for candidate gene sets calculated by the above four
steps, a multiple testing correction procedure is further adopted, and the
ﬁnal P—values for gene sets are obtained. The gene sets are then ranked in
non-decreasing order according to their ﬁnal P—values.

2.2 Regression model for detecting differential regulation

We represent a transcriptional regulatory network as a directed graph, in
which a node denotes either a TF or a target gene, and a directed edge,
pointing from a TF to a target gene, indicating the regulatory relationship
between the TF and the target gene. Note that although detailed regula-
tory mechanisms such as activation or inhibition are desired, we found
that annotations of such regulatory mechanisms are largely absent in

most databases [e.g. TRANSFAC (Matys et al., 2003) and HTRIdb
(Bovolenta et al., 2012)]. Therefore, we do not use any annotations of
regulatory mechanisms in our study. We deﬁne a candidate gene set
typically as a collection of genes that are involved in the same functional
pathway of some biological process. A gene expression proﬁle consists of
the expression levels of the genes in a sample. Particularly, we are inter-
ested in comparing the gene expression proﬁles of a normal phenotype
and those of the counterpart (i.e. a perturbed phenotype).

Given a candidate gene set, we map genes in the set onto the tran-
scriptional regulatory network to obtain a sub-network G = {V, E},
where E is a set of directed edges connecting genes and V the set of
nodes (genes) connected by the edges in E. For each edge in the sub-
network, we identify the TF and the target gene, extract their expression
proﬁles for the normal and perturbed phenotypes and build a linear re-
gression model for each phenotype to explain the expression levels of the
target gene by those of the TF as

Y§i>=ao+c<t> x Xfi)+s,‘-i),j= 1,  (1)

where the superscript iindexes the normal (i = 0) or the perturbed (i = 1)

the TF and the target gene for observation j, respectively, or“) and ,8“) the
regression intercept and slope, respectively, 8;) a zero mean Gaussian
noise with standard deviation 0;) and n,- the sample size.

Clearly, in the above regression model, the slope reﬂects the regulatory
capacity of the TF on the target gene. Therefore, we propose to detect the
alteration of the regulatory relationship between the normal and per-
turbed phenotypes by testing the hypothesis

The P—value of the proposed two-sided test can then be calculated as
p:2P(Tn0+n1—4>|tl)a 

where III is the absolute value of the realized test statistic.

The above single-TF model only considers the situation that a target
gene is regulated by a single TF. To further formulate the regulation of
multiple TFs on a target gene, we propose the following multiple-TF
model that resorts to principal component analysis to decompose the
combined effects of multiple TFs into independent factors (i.e. principal
components).

Let X: {xﬁnxm be expression levels of the m TFs across n conditions,
where n = n1 + n2. We calculate the principal component decomposition
of X as c = XV, where V is an m-by-m matrix whose columns are eigen-
vectors of the covariance matrix of X. The kth column of C then includes
an independent factor Ck = {cjk}nX1,j = 1, . . . ,n, k = 1, . . . ,m. Then, we

explain the expression level of the target gene by each of the independent
factors separately using a regression model, as

Yy)=Ol(i)+pg) X cj(.1?+ej(.i), j=1,...,n,-, (7)
where Y? and cg: are the expression level of the target gene and the value
of the kth independent factor, respectively, both for observation j and
phenotype i. Finally, the hypothesis testing problem

H0 : pm) =p(1) versus H1 : pm) 75 pa) (8)

can be conducted in a similar way to the single-TF model.

2.3 Calibration of statistical signiﬁcance

With P—values for edges obtained, we calculate the statistical signiﬁcance
of a gene set using Fisher’s combined probability test (Fisher, 1925). For
the single-TF model, we calculate a statistic as

= — zzlogpe. <9)

eeE

where E is the set of edges corresponding to a gene set, and pe the P—value
for edge e e E. It is evident that U has a x2 distribution with degrees of
freedom being twice the number of edges in the gene set when all null
hypotheses are true and all the P—values are independent. For the mul-
tiple-TF model, we calculate a statistic as

U: —22 Z wklogpk, (10)

geG keC(g)

where G is the set of target genes in a gene set, C(g) independent factors
for gene g, pk and wk the P—value and weight of the kth factor, respect-
ively. We set wk =Ak/Eiec(g)ki by default, with Ak being the eigenvalue
corresponding to the kth principle component.

For each gene set, we further adopt the following permutation proced-
ure to obtain a P—value from the statistic U, based on the recommenda-
tion in literature that sampling individuals is superior to sampling genes
(Goeman and Buhlmann, 2007).

Step 1: Calculate the realized value uO of the test statistic for the given

gene set using the original gene expression proﬁles.

Step 2: Shufﬂe the phenotype labels in the expression proﬁles.
Calculate a realized value of the test statistic using the per-
muted expression proﬁles.

Step 3: Repeat Step 2 a number of N times to obtain a series of
realized statistic values u1,,,,,uN_ Count the number of times
such values are greater than uO. Divide this number by N to
obtain a P—value for the gene set.

Note that such a permutation procedure also eliminates the inﬂuence
of the size of the gene set. With P—values for candidate gene sets calcu-
lated, we further perform multiple testing corrections by controlling the
false discovery rate (Benjamini and Hochberg, 1995).

3 RESULTS

3.1 Data sources

We used three datasets of Escherichia coli for simulation studies,
including a regulatory network extracted from the RegulonDB
database (Gama-Castro et al., 2008), expression proﬁles of 10
antibiotic-treated samples and 10 untreated samples from the
Many Microbe Microarrays Database (M3D) (Faith et al.,
2008), and a collection of gene sets extracted from the gene ontol-
ogy (GO) (Ashburner et al., 2000). We used eight datasets of
human for real data analysis, including two regulatory networks

extracted from the HTRIdb database (Bovolenta et al., 2012)
and the ENCODE project (Gerstein et al., 2012), three groups
of expression proﬁles and two ChIP—seq datasets extracted from
the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (Edgar et al.,
2002) and a collection of manually curated gene sets obtained
from the Molecular Signatures Database (MSigDB) (Liberzon
et al., 2011). Detailed descriptions of these datasets are given in
Supplementary Material (Section S1).

3.2 Simulation experiments

We ﬁrst performed a simulation study to explore the capability
of DRAGEN in detecting the alteration of the transcriptional
regulatory relationship between a single TF and a single target
gene, based on the E. coli data. Results, as shown in
Supplementary Material (Section S2), clearly demonstrate the
effectiveness of our method in detecting differential regulatory
patterns in this situation.

We then conducted a series of simulation experiments to
evaluate the performance of our method in ﬁnding differentially
regulated gene sets. To generate gene sets, we mapped E. coli
genes onto the biological process domain of GO, obtaining 3334
genes annotated with 1295 GO terms. In this procedure, we re-
garded a gene as annotated with a term if the gene is annotated
with a child of the term in the directed acyclic graph structure of
GO. Excluding terms appearing in the top two layers of the GO
structure and focusing on those annotated with 5—500 genes, we
extracted 318 terms. Further focusing on genes included in
RegulonDB, we obtained a total of 59 gene sets, one correspond-
ing to a GO term (Supplementary Table S1 and Fig. S3).

In an experiment, we selected at random a test case from the
59 gene sets and used the remaining 58 sets as templates to gen-
erate controls. For the test case, we embedded a differential regu-
lation pattern (power law or logistic) in a proportion of the
edges, where the proportion (,0) and the strength of differential
regulation (2) were treated as parameters. To generate a control
case, we replaced the genes in a template with those selected at
random from the transcriptional regulatory network. We then
applied DRAGEN to calculate P—values for simulated gene sets
and further ranked the case against the controls.

Repeating this experiment 1000 times, we obtain the same
number of ranking lists. We then derive a criterion to quantify
the performance of our method. Using the P—value as a cut-off,
we calculated the sensitivity as the fraction of test cases whose P-
values were less than or equal to the cut-off value and the spe-
ciﬁcity as the fraction of negatives controls whose p—values were
greater than the threshold. Varying the cut-off value, we ob-
tained a series of sensitivities and speciﬁcities, and we were
able to plot a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve
and calculate an AUC score as the area under this curve.

The results of this simulation study are shown in Figure 2,
from which we clearly see the effectiveness of our method in
detecting differentially regulated gene sets. The values of A indi-
cate the degree of differential regulation for each embedded edge
(Supplementary Material, Section S2.l). The larger the absolute
value of (A— l) is, the higher degree of differential regulation is.
Taking the regulation loss case (2—0) in the logistic model
(Fig. 2e) as an example, when the proportion of embedded dif-
ferentially regulated edges is 10%, the AUC score is 0.568. When

the proportion of differentially regulated edges increases to 50%,
the AUC score increases to 0.843. When the proportion of dif-
ferentially regulated edges keeps increasing toward 100%, the
AUC score tends to be stable at around 0.926. Similar phenom-
ena are observed for the other values of ,x. These results suggest
that even in the case that regulatory relationships are signiﬁ-
cantly nonlinear, our methods are still capable of identifying
some differentially regulated gene sets that include a proportion
of differentially regulated interactions.

3.3 Application to an estradiol treated MCF—7 cell line

We assessed the capability of DRAGEN in detecting differential
regulatory events concerning estrogen receptor a (ESRl). From
ChIP-seq data (GSE23701) of MCF-7 cells, we identiﬁed 1584
genes with different ESRl binding events before and after the
treatment of estradiol—l7—,B (E2). From expression data
(GSEll352), we collected nine E2-treated and nine untreated
samples. We then applied DRAGEN to quantify the strength
of differential regulation for these genes and compared their
P—values with those of interactions selected at random from
HTRI. Results, as detailed in Supplementary Material (Section
S3. 1), show that P—values of the differentially regulated genes are
signiﬁcantly smaller than random cases (one-sided Wilcoxon test
P—value<2.2 x 10’”), indicating the effectiveness in detecting
differential regulation.

We then evaluated the performance of our method in detecting
differentially regulated gene sets that included ESRl. Mapping
each of those gene sets from MsigDB category 02 onto the regu-
latory network and focusing on gene sets containing at least three
edges, we obtained a total of 711 gene sets, among which 71
contained the ESRl gene and its target genes. Treating these
71 gene sets as positive cases and the rest 640 as negative con-
trols, we applied our method for these gene sets and further
generated a ranking list. And then we plotted an ROC in
Figure 3a.

We ﬁrst compared the performance of DRAGEN with a
simple correlation coefﬁcient approach, and observed the
better performance of our method (Supplementary Material,

Fig. 3. ROC curves of different methods on (a) MCF-7, (b) LNCaP and (c) HeLa cells. In the zoomed-in plots, the ROCs of DRAGEN climb faster
than those of the other methods toward the top-left corner, indicting its better performance

Section S3.7). We then compared our method with three existing
methods (GSEA, ORA and SAFE) and plotted their ROCs in
Figure 3a. Results show that the curves of DRAGEN climb to-
ward the top-left corner of the zoomed-in plot rapidly, suggesting
the high performance of our method. AUC scores (0.843 for the
single-TF model of DRAGEN, 0.569, 0.527 and 0.512 for
GSEA, ORA and SAFE, respectively) further support the effect-
iveness of our method.

We next compared our method with GGEA that also utilized
network information. Since the annotations of the activation or
inhibition mechanism of regulation required by this method were
largely absent in databases (Bovolenta et al., 2012; Matys et al.,
2003), we ﬁrst used the untreated samples to infer the activation
or inhibition mechanism for each edge in the regulatory network
by ﬁtting a linear regression model and hypothesis testing
whether the regression slope was positive (for activation) or
negative (for inhibition), respectively. We then applied GGEA
to prioritize the 711 gene sets. Nevertheless, our results showed
that all adjusted P—values of the gene sets turned out to be 1,
making further analysis infeasible. We conjectured that this poor
performance of GGEA was partly caused by the quality of an-
notations of regulatory mechanisms and hence left GGEA out of
the plots.

We also compared our method with DEAP that integrated
pathway and expression data. As this method needed pathway
structures as input, the comparison was performed on a subset of
the gene sets that represent pathways in KEGG (Ogata et al.,
1999) and Reactome (Croft et al., 2011), and discussed separately
in Supplementary Material (Section S3.5).

We further analyzed the ranking list of the 711 gene sets gen-
erated by DRAGEN and found that 20 out of the 71 positive
cases were ranked among the top 50 (Table 1 and Supplementary
Table S3). By comparison, GSEA, ORA and SAFE found 14, 11
and 11 positive cases among their top 50, respectively
(Supplementary Tables S4—S6). The comparison among the top
10 (and top 20) gene sets of these methods and the enrichment
signiﬁcance by Fisher’s exact test was in Supplementary
Material, Supplementary Table S2, which clearly showed the
better performance of DRAGEN. In hormone-dependent

breast cancer epithelial cells such as MCF-7, ERa—mediated es-
trogen acts as a dominant stimulus for the proliferation and
survival of the cells (Risbridger et al., 2010). Particularly,
MCF-7 cells stimulated with estrogen could progress to a more
malignant stage (Levenson and Jordan 1997). With DRAGEN,
four gene sets with both ESRl and its target genes were ranked
at the top (the ﬁrst), and six positive gene sets were ranked
among the top 10 (Supplementary Fig. S5). The connections
between several top ranked gene sets and estrogen treatment
on MCF—7 cells reported in the literature were discussed in
Supplementary Material (Section S32).

3.4 Application to an androgen-treated LNCaP cell line

From ChIP-seq data (GSE28126) of an LNCaP cell line, we
identiﬁed 237 genes with different androgen receptor (AR) bind-
ing events before and after the treatment of R1881 (Metribolone,
a potent androgen). From expression data (GSE18684), we col-
lected 20 R1881-treated and 20 untreated samples. We then
applied DRAGEN to quantify the strength of differential regu-
lation. Results show that P—values of the differentially regulated
genes are signiﬁcantly smaller than random cases (one-sided
Wilcoxon test P—value<9 x 106), further supporting the effect-
iveness of our method (Supplementary Material, Section S3.3).
We then evaluated the capability of DRAGEN on distinguish-
ing differentially regulated gene sets that included AR. Again we
mapped the gene sets from MsigDB category 02 onto the HTRI
network. We obtained a total of 499 gene sets containing at least
three edges, among which 50 contained the AR gene and its
target genes. We checked the functional annotations of the 50
gene sets and removed one that was meaningful only for females.
Finally, we obtained 49 gene sets as positive cases and the rest
450 as negative controls to perform the following experiment.
We applied our method to these gene sets and eventually gen-
erated a ranking list. Similar to the breast cancer case, we plotted
the ROC in Figure 3b and obtained the AUC score as 0.761. By
comparing with the other methods (the AUC is 0.582 for GSEA,
0.625 for ORA and 0.631 for SAFE), we clearly saw the high
performance of our method. With DRAGEN, 14 out of the 49
gene sets containing AR were ranked among the top 50 in a list

These gene sets were ranked among the top 50 by DRAGEN out of 711 gene sets in the analysis of MCF-7 cells

composed of a total of 499 gene sets (Table 2 and Supplementary
Table S8). In comparison, GSEA, ORA and SAFE found 6, 10
and 8 positive gene sets among their top 50 gene sets, respectively
(Supplementary Tables S9—S11). From Table 2, we observed that
the androgen signaling pathway was correctly ranked as the top
1, which was not detected by the other methods (i.e. found to be
among the top 50). All three positive gene sets ranked among the
top 10 by DRAGEN are presented in Supplementary Figure S7.
The connections between several top ranked gene sets and an-
drogen treatment on LNCaP cells reported in the literature were
discussed in Supplementary Material (Section S34).

3.5 Application to a HeLa cell line

This experiment intended to examine gene regulation patterns
altered during the cell cycle progression on a HeLa cell line.
Differential regulations by many TFs were observed across the
cell cycle progression in the literature ( Burkhart et al., 2010;
Takahashi et al., 2000). For example, the E2F and pRB families
were known to play pivotal roles in timely regulating gene ex-
pression during the cell cycle progression and their promoter
binding afﬁnities change during the process (Takahashi et al.,
2000). Hence, we used the expression data at multiple time
points in the cell cycle of HeLa cells to test the performance of
DRAGEN. The expression data were obtained at six time points,
so we manually separated the data into two classes. The ﬁrst
class covered the ﬁrst three time points, all contained in inter-
phase. The second class consisted of the other three time points,
spanning mitosis. Since some of the members of the E2F family
(e.g. E2F1) were found to be enriched in the ENCODE regula-
tory network, we combined the ENCODE network with the
HTRI network as our regulatory network in the experiment.
As before, we considered gene sets from MSigDB category 02

and focused on gene sets that contain at least three edges. We
used the functional annotation in MSigDB as an evidence of
association to the cell cycle progression, and treated gene sets
whose functional annotations explicitly mention the involvement
in the cell cycle progression as positive cases. This resulted in a
total of 1193 gene sets, of which 28 gene sets were directly asso-
ciated with cell cycle and deﬁned as positives.

We applied GSEA, SAFE, ORA and DRAGEN to the HeLa
dataset. The ROCs of DRAGEN and ORA were plotted in
Figure 30. Their AUC scores were 0.783 and 0.464, respectively.
The ROCs of GSEA and SAFE were omitted here but presented
in Supplementary Figure S8 because they were unable to ﬁnd
any signiﬁcant gene sets (FDR<0.25). Their detailed ﬁndings
were given in Supplementary Tables S14 and S16. To understand
the poor performance of these two methods, we performed two-
sided t-test on all expressed genes to estimate their degree of
differential expression, and we found that the proportion of sig-
niﬁcantly differentially expressed genes was less than 1% (with
Bonferroni corrected P—value<0.05). This might partly explain
the poor performance of SAFE and GSEA, since both were
based on differential expression. DRAGEN ranked 6 of the 28
positive gene sets among the top 50 of the 1193 gene sets (Table 3
and and Supplementary Table S13) while ORA ranked three
positive gene sets among the top 50 (Supplementary Table
S15). The results in Figure 30 suggested that DRAGEN was
sensitive and effective in detecting differential regulation in the
situation of low differential expression.

It is interesting to observe that two of the top ranked positive
gene sets from DRAGEN (BIOCARTA_P27_PATHWAY and
BIOCARTA_RACCYCD_PATHWAY) contain both genes
RBI and E2Fl, and the regulation of RBl by E2Fl changes
signiﬁcantly during the cell cycle progression (P-value = 0.0003).

in the analysis of HeLa cells

This differential regulation has been conﬁrmed by ChIP experi-
ments at different cell cycle phases in the literature (Burkhart
et al., 2010).

3.6 Performance of the multiple-TF model

We repeated experiments for the MCF-7, LNCaP and HeLa
datasets using the multiple-TF model and showed the results in
Figure 3. For MCF-7, the AUC scores of the single-TF and
multiple-TF models were 0.843 and 0.832, respectively. For
LNCaP, the AUC scores were 0.761 and 0.783. For HeLa, the
AUC scores were 0.783 and 0.818. These results suggested that
the multiple-TF model outperformed the single-TF one on the
LNCaP and HeLa datasets. The corresponding positive gene sets
among their top 50 gene sets were shown in Supplementary
Tables S7, S12 and S17, respectively.

3.7 Robustness of DRAGEN

Because of the dynamics of transcriptional regulatory relation-
ships and limitation of existing experimental techniques
(Bovolenta et al., 2012), the HTRI network, though built from
numerous other databases that contain experimentally veriﬁed

human regulatory interactions, might still be far from being com-
plete and fully correct. With this consideration, we tested the
robustness of our method with respect to the incompleteness
and possible errors in the transcriptional regulatory network
by entirely replacing the HTRI network with a network con-
structed according to a series of ChIP-seq experiments in the
ENCODE project (Gerstein et al., 2012). See Supplementary
Material (Section S3.6) for a detailed description of the HTRI
and ENCODE networks.

Focusing on gene sets containing at least three edges in the
ENCODE network, we obtained a total of 1000 gene sets,
among which 51 sets contained at least one gene regulated by
ESRl. Considering that the network was sparse and possibly
incomplete, and being aware of the fact that a small number of
differentially regulated edges inside a gene set might not be
enough to represent the overall differential regulation mechanism
of the entire gene set, we only selected gene sets with at least k
ESRl regulatory edges as the phenotype-associated gene sets,
instead of all the 51 gene sets. For relatively small values of k
(3 and 5), we collected 33 and 26 gene sets as the test gene sets,
respectively. We then applied DRAGEN to rank these gene sets
against the rest of the 1000 gene sets and presented the resulting
ROCs in Supplementary Figure S9.

The AUC scores are 0.718 and 0.794 for k = 3 and 5, respect-
ively. Though not as high as the one in the previous study using
the HTRI network (AUC = 0.843), these AUC scores still
strongly suggest the effectiveness of DRAGEN when used
with the ENCODE network. Moreover, we notice that a larger
k produces a better ROC with a higher AUC score
(Supplementary Fig. S9). These observations are consistent
with the expectation that gene sets containing more differen-
tially regulated edges tend to rank toward the top. We further
collect a total of 559 gene sets shared by the HTRI and
ENCODE data, and ﬁnd the Spearman’s correlation coefﬁcient
of the relative ranks of these gene sets is only 0.42, suggesting
that the relative ranks of these gene sets are actually very
different.

3.8 Performance on random regulatory networks
and gene sets

In order to assess the actual contributions of the regulatory net-
work and gene sets to the performance of DRAGEN, we tested
DRAGEN on regulatory networks and gene sets with randomly
introduced noise. First, we perturbed the sub-network of each
gene set by randomly shufﬂing N % of its nodes while it kept the
same topology. For each parameter N (=10, 20,..., 80), we
perturbed the sub-network of every gene set 1000 times to gen-
erate 1000 test datasets. The original 71, 49 and 28 positive gene
sets were still used as the positive cases. The performance of
DRAGEN on these datasets is shown in Supplementary Figure
S10. The ﬁgure clearly illustrates that the performance of
DRAGEN declines as N increases. The median AUC scores
are around 0.814, 0.750 and 0.763 for the MCF-7, LNCaP and
HeLa data when N is equal to 10, but fall to 0.724, 0.691 and
0.722 when a half of the nodes in each sub-network are shufﬂed
(N = 50). This demonstrates that the network information plays
a key role in DRAGEN.

Then we perturbed the gene sets by randomly choosing N %
genes of each gene set and replacing them with an equal number
of genes selected randomly from all expressed genes. The regu-
latory network from the HTRI database was ﬁxed as the input
regulatory network. As before, for each parameter N (= 10,
20,. . ., 80), we perturbed every gene set 1000 times to generate
1000 test datasets and used the original 71 and 49 positive gene
sets as the positive cases. The performance of DRAGEN on
these datasets is shown in Supplementary Figure Sll. Again,
the performance of DRAGEN clearly declines as N increases.
The median AUC scores are around 0.828, 0.749 and 0.768 for
the MCF-7, LNCaP and HeLa data when N is 10, but fall to
0.754, 0.696 and 0.674 when a half of the genes in every gene sets
are shufﬂed (N = 50). Therefore, high-quality gene sets are also
critical to the performance of DRAGEN.

4 CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

In this article, we have proposed a method, named DRAGEN,
to integrate gene expression data and a regulatory network for
differential regulation enrichment analysis. Through a series of
comprehensive simulation and real data experiments, we demon-
strate its power in detecting alterations of regulation not only
between individual TFs and their targets but also among a set of
genes.

The effectiveness of our method is due to a combination of
two aspects. First, we systematically use gene expression data
and transcriptional regulation information in an integrative
way. Existing methods largely depend on gene expression data
alone to detect differentially regulated gene sets that may be
associated with a phenotype of interest, overlooking the fact
that alterations of gene expression levels may actually result
from the changes of regulatory patterns. Therefore, our
method, which directly detects changes in regulatory relation-
ships, is in principle more powerful in discovering gene sets in
response to a perturbed phenotype. Second, we ground our
method on a rigorous statistical model, which successfully con-
nects the regulatory relationship between a TF and its target gene
to their expression proﬁles. With this model, the detection of

differentially regulated gene sets is converted to a series of
hypothesis testing problems followed by the fusion of individual
P—values, thereby enabling our method to quantify subtle
changes in regulatory relationships for achieving a strong per-
formance in differential regulation enrichment analysis.

On the other hand, several aspects of DRAGEN can perhaps
be further improved. First, it is known that the expression of a
gene is regulated by not only multiple TFs, but also post-tran-
scriptional factors such as microRNAs. Besides, the expression
level of a TF may not truly reﬂect the activity of the TF.
Therefore, our method, though having taken the effects of mul-
tiple TFs into consideration, may fail to incorporate the contri-
butions of other factors and thus produce additional false
positives in a real application. In this sense, our method is
more suitable to be used as an exploratory tool. Second, al-
though the linear regression model demonstrates reasonably
good power in detecting differentially regulated patterns, the
true relationships between expression levels of TFs and target
genes might not be ideally linear. Hence, a more sophisticated
model that takes non-linearity into consideration might be desir-
able for capturing more general regulatory relationships. How to
achieve a reasonable control over the model complexity to avoid
overﬁtting when the sample size is limited is a question that needs
to be carefully addressed. Third, sub-networks obtained by map-
ping gene sets to an underlying network may be incomplete and
thus may miss important interactions. A plausible solution is
trying to generate a more complete regulatory network. For ex-
ample, the methods from DREAM Challenge Five (Marbach
et al., 2010) can be used to construct a regulatory network
from gene expression proﬁles, which could be further combined
with the one derived from the biological experiments. How to
combine experimental and computational resources to construct
a high-quality comprehensive regulatory network and extend our
current model taking into account all above considerations is a
direction that we plan to pursue in the immediate future.

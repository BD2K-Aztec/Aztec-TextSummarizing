ABSTRACT

Motivation: Reverse-phase protein arrays (RPPAs) allow sensitive
quantification of relative protein abundance in thousands of samples
in parallel. Typical challenges involved in this technology are antibody
selection, sample preparation and optimization of staining conditions.
The issue of combining effective sample management and data ana-
lysis, however, has been widely neglected.

Results: This motivated us to develop MIRACLE, a comprehensive
and user-friendly web application bridging the gap between spotting
and array analysis by conveniently keeping track of sample informa-
tion. Data processing includes correction of staining bias, estimation
of protein concentration from response curves, normalization for total
protein amount per sample and statistical evaluation. Established ana-
lysis methods have been integrated with MIRACLE, offering experi-
mental scientists an end-to-end solution for sample management and
for carrying out data analysis. In addition, experienced users have the
possibility to export data to R for more complex analyses. MIRACLE
thus has the potential to further spread utilization of RPPAs as an
emerging technology for high-throughput protein analysis.

1 INTRODUCTION

Reverse-phase protein arrays are typically nitrocellulose-covered
glass slides on which crude lysates of tissue samples or treated
cell lines are spotted. Each single slide can carry several thousand
spots. Only small amounts of lysate in the range of a few cell
equivalents are required for each spot. Consequently, several
hundred slide copies can be created at minimal sample consump-
tion, each of which can be interrogated with a different protein-
specific antibody. This allows high-throughput measurement of
the relative abundance of proteins in up to several thousand
samples. Parallel processing of large sample numbers discerns
RPPAs from forward phase arrays, where probes are immobi-
lized on a slide, and mass spectrometry, which are suitable for
analysis of many proteins in small sample numbers.

authors should be regarded as Joint First Authors.

The field of RPPAs has shown steady growth since its intro-
duction in 2001 (Paweletz et al., 2001) (Fig. 1). Several studies
applied this technology successfully to protein and signaling
pathway analyses in cancer (Leivonen et al., 2009; Sevecka and
MacBeath, 2006; Uhlmann et al., 2012; York et al., 2012), as well
as for cancer subtype classiﬁcation and prognosis of disease pro-
gression (Gonzalez-Angulo et al., 2011; Sonntag et al., 2014;
Wiegand et al., 2014). The relevance of RPPA data for multi-
OMICS and high-throughput projects is also highlighted by its
inclusion into the Cancer Genome Atlas, where, for instance,
measurements of 171 antibodies for >400 samples of breast
cancer patients are available (Atlas, 2012).

1.1 Challenges

Experimental challenges involved in this technology, such as
antibody selection, sample preparation and optimization of
staining conditions, have been addressed successfully in the
past (Hennessy et al., 2010; Mannsperger et al., 2010b;
Mircean et al., 2005; Spurrier et al., 2008). The subsequent
image analysis can be handled by established methods and soft-
ware developed for traditional microarrays, such as the commer-
cial tool MicroVigene®. RPPA-speciﬁc challenges arise in the
further processing of the quantified signal, which, in a first step,
should be corrected for bias introduced through uneven staining
(Neeley et al., 2012). Another concern is the dynamic range of
signal detection, which can be described as a sigmoidal curve due
to limitations in sensitivity in the lower range and signal satur-
ation in the upper range (Tabus et al., 2006). Through adjusting
each sample for the total protein amount a priori, measurement
is possible in the linear range of this curve. However, this is often
not feasible for high-throughput experiments, due to the trade-
off between large sample numbers, feasibility and costs. To over-
come this problem, samples are typically spotted multiple times
in a dilution series to cover a broad dynamic range of protein
concentrations, where each sample gives rise to a response curve.
In a process called quantification, an estimate of relative protein
abundance is created by merging these values (Supplementary
Fig. S1). The resulting relative concentration estimates still
need to be normalized for the total amount of protein, before
they can be evaluated statistically. Statistical analysis comprises
assessing significance of relative differences in protein concentra-
tion estimates, as well as their correlation between slides and

other types of readout. Finally, the large number of samples
involved in each experiment poses a signiﬁcant challenge in
terms of sample management.

1.2 Quantiﬁcation

Mircean et al. (2005) proposed a linear model for merging the
signal originating from individual response curves. One draw-
back of this approach is that a linear model cannot deal with
samples close to saturation or close to the detection limit.
Consequently, Tabus et al. (2006) compared a variety of para-
metric models and found that a logistic model was most suitable
to reﬂect the sigmoidal shape of the response curve.
Furthermore, a joint response curve based on all samples
increased the conﬁdence of the model ﬁt, as similar chemistry
can be assumed for all samples. Hu et al. (2007) showed that a
more flexible non-parametric model yields more accurate esti-
mates at the cost of robustness. Finally, Zhang et al. (2009)
proposed a simpliﬁed robust parametric model called serial dilu-
tion curve based on the Sips model for DNA binding. In contrast
to other parametric models, this method is based on meaningful
and intuitive parameters like the detection limit, the dilution
factor and the saturation level.

1.3 Normalization

If the total protein amount of each sample is not determined
a prion, protein levels have to be normalized, to guarantee a
meaningful comparison between samples. This can be achieved
by either normalizing to a slide stained for total protein with, for
instance, Sypro Ruby (Leivonen et al., 2009) or Fast Green
(Loebke et al., 2007), or by using additional antibody stainings.
For the latter approach, one can rely on either a selection of
‘housekeeping’ proteins that are assumed to be constantly
expressed or on incorporating the entire panel of anti-
body-generated signals, where all antibodies are ﬁrst centred
and scaled before the median value is used for normalization.
This so-called median loading normalization has been improved
by Neeley et al. (2009) in a method called variable slope normal-
ization. Here, a correction factor is included to take into account

that additional bias arises due to independent slide
measurements.

Finally, Neeley et al. (2012) also proposed an additional nor-
malization step called surface adjustment that is applied to the
raw data. As customary for all microarray data, the background
signal is determined for each spot and subtracted from the fore-
ground signal. This approach, however, does not correct for
signal bias due to uneven antibody staining, which is an issue
speciﬁc to RPPA technology. Positive control spots on the slide
can be utilized for creating a smoothing surface mirroring the
staining bias. A correction factor can then be calculated from a
generalized linear model for each individual spot.

1.4 Sample tracking

A single RPPA experiment may comprise thousands of samples
distributed over large slide sets. Precise sample tracking is a chal-
lenge that grows with the number, size and complexity of the
RPPA experiments. To date, the only documented solution to
address this critical issue is an integrated platform called RIMS
(Stanislaus et al., 2008), which provides features for uploading
and annotating sample information, data visualization, correl-
ation and pathway analysis. Notably, the authors also propose
a XML standard called RPPAML to overcome the lack of a data
exchange format for RPPA data and a standardized annotation.
Unfortunately, however, none of the project URLs are accessible
(last access attempt March 20, 2014), indicating that the project
is no longer under active development and has not been adapted
by the community. Being implemented for the commercial soft-
ware MA T LAB, RIMS also lacks integration of R methods com-
monly used for RPPA analyses. Finally, RIMS only supports
sample tracking at the slide level and not at the level of the
plate formats that form the basis for all experimentation. This
leaves the most difﬁcult step of sample tracking to the user:
Samples are taken up by an extraction head conﬁgured to gen-
erate a slide in multiple extractions, thereby producing a complex
spotting pattern that does not permit researchers to locate their
samples in a straight-forward fashion.

1.5 Existing solutions

Implementations for both, parametric and non-parametric meth-
ods are available through the R packages SuperCurve (Hu et al.,
2007) and RPPcmalyzer (Mannsperger et al., 2010a). A major
challenge in analysing RPPA data is, however, that end users
are often not familiar with R. SuperCurve overcomes this prob-
lem partly by offering an tcl/tk-based graphical user interface,
making both analysis and experimental design more accessible.
Sample management on a larger scale, however, is neglected.
RIMS addresses some of these issues, but does not cover more
complex data analysis (see Table 1).

1.6 Microarray R-based analysis of complex lysate
experiments (MIRACLE)

This motivated us to develop MIRACLE, a comprehensive
and user-friendly open-source web application providing an
end-to-end solution covering experimental design, sample track-
ing, data processing, normalization, as well as visualization and
statistical analysis of the results. MIRACLE conveniently keeps

track of sample information, starting with the source plates,
throughout array generation and down to the signal data, in a
process called virtual spotting.

MIRACLE allows biological researchers without any know-
ledge of R to process and analyse RPPA data efﬁciently, grasp-
ing back to established methods by interacting directly with R in
the background. This interface will also allow future methods to
be added in a straight-forward fashion. Results are directly visua-
lized and can be investigated interactively with regards to statis-
tical signiﬁcance, as well as to correlation to primary plate based
readout data.

MIRACLE is designed with user approachability in mind, but
also supports R data analysts by offering a convenient data
export/import interface with R. While the data analysis part of
MIRACLE is particularly laid out for handling RPPA data, the
sample management functionality is suitable for any kind of
customized array design.

With its deep integration of sample management and data
analysis, MIRACLE separates itself from existing solutions
that only cover parts of the RPPA work-ﬂow shown in
Figure 2. See Table 1 for an overview of existing solutions and
MIRACLE.

2 SYSTEM AND METHODS
2.1 Sample management

2.1.] Plate and slide layouts In a typical RPPA experiment,
lysate samples are stored in 96-well or 384-well microtiter
plate, before they are subjected to microarray generation using
a bioarrayer, -printer or -spotter. Already at this stage,
MIRACLE supports experimental design by offering an inter-
active web interface for creating so-called plate layouts. To avoid
cryptic and long sample names, several layers of information can
be included, for instance regarding cell material, treatments,

Fig. 2. Schematic exemplary work-ﬂow of RPPA construction and ana-
lysis via MIRACLE. (A) Larger sample sets are stored in multiple source
plates, with individual and partly complex sample information.
Optionally primary plate readout data can be included. (B) The individ-
ual sample lysates are diluted (indicated by the colour gradient) in a ﬁrst
reformatting step and subsequently spotted onto slides in a customized
pattern. (C) Multiple array copies are generated and stained with differ-
ent antibodies, adding to the sample tracking demands. (D) An array
scanner yields signal intensities for all spots, which need to be further
processed to obtain the ﬁnal results. MIRACLE offers a user interface for
data analysis under automated mapping of samples on the RPPAs to
plate— and slide-based data

applied compounds, lysis conditions, etc. (Fig. 3). A lot of this
information is shared by samples and is therefore redundant.
MIRACLE stores information in relational databases, where
each layer corresponds to a single property, keeping the data
concise through use of ids and mapping tables (Supplementary
Fig. S2). By relying on linked tables of a relational database,
changes of layout properties are immediately available to all
samples and experiments, thereby ensuring data consistency
and comparability in the analyses.

Similar to plate layouts, users can also deﬁne slide layouts, in
which sample properties for each individual spot of the slide can
be edited using the aforementioned sample layers. The format of
the slide is determined through specifying the number of rows
and columns, as well as blocks where applicable, e. g. when using
spotters, where each pin of the extraction head gives rise to a
different block.

2.1.2 Virtual spotting As previously mentioned, it is not always
trivial to determine the location of a sample on the slide, since a
large number of samples originate from different plates.
Furthermore, repetitive spotting of samples with various dilu-
tions and varying number of depositions per spot has to be con-
sidered, as well as the format of the extraction head. MIRACLE
addresses this issue in a feature called virtual spotting, where
previously created plate layouts are combined with information
about the operation mode of the spotter, such as format of the
extraction head, column or row-wise extraction, top-to-bottom
or left-to-right spotting, to determine the ﬁnal layout. The selec-
tion and order of the plates can be manipulated via drag-
and-drop and for each plate individual extractions can be
excluded. If a so-called deposition pattern is used, in which

Fig. 3. Sample management of plate layouts illustrated for an exemplary 96-well plate layout. Several layers of information are accessible

several adjacent spots originate from the same sample, but are
spotted with varying depositions, the layout can be simpliﬁed.
Because these samples are otherwise identical, the respective col-
umns of the layout can be merged.

2.1.3 Projects and experiments MIRACLE offers a quick
search ﬁeld to locate sample information quickly using full text
search. However, to keep experimental data organized, projects
and experiments can be created, linked to layouts and subse-
quently be used for ﬁltering.

2.2 Data processing

2.2.1 Slides Slide layouts can be linked to an arbitrary number
of slides, which correspond to the copies created during spotting.
For each slide, additional information such as a barcode, the
antibody that was used for staining and scanner settings, such
as the wavelength of the readout can be speciﬁed. Three types of
ﬁles can be uploaded, including the output ﬁle from the scanner
containing signal intensities, an image of the slide and an experi-
mental protocol.

2.2.2 Supported file formats The experimental protocol can be
of any ﬁle type (e.g. doc, pdf or txt), while for images the most
common ﬁle types, such as jpg, png and tiff, are supported.
MIRACLE processes each image into a zoomable format for
visual detection of quality issues, such as clogged tips, scratches
or uneven stainings. With regards to the array scanner output,
MIRACLE is not limited to certain ﬁle types, but has a ﬂexible
system supporting import of comma, semicolon, tab-separated
or Microsoft Excel ® ﬁles without requiring a specifc format.

2.2.3 Processing raw data After successfully reading the scan-
ner ﬁle, MIRACLE will offer to add all spots to the database.
During this process, the signal of each spot is linked to the
sample information stored in the slide layout. Subsequently,
users can create heatmaps to visualize the data to detect
quality problems. One example are block shifts introduced by
the scanner software that can then be corrected for
(Supplementary Fig. S3).

2.2.4 Plates and readouts Similar to how slides can be added to
slide layouts, plates can be added to plate layouts, where

 

i634

9IOZ ‘091sn3nv uo ::

MIRACLE

 

additional information, such as plate and well type, barcode and
replicate number are stored. If a readout is performed before
plates are subjected to spotting, for example, ﬂuorescence-
based measurement of cell viability or colourimetric analysis of
total protein amount, MIRACLE allows for adding these results
for each plate, utilizing the aforementioned ﬁle upload
mechanism.

2.3 Data analysis

When sample management and data processing are complete,
users can begin with data analysis. After selecting a slide
layout, the user is presented with a list of all slides linked to
this layout. In case the slide layout was created through virtual
spotting, readouts linked to the source plates are also shown. By
starting the analysis, the user will be forwarded to an R-based
web application called Rmiracle, which will automatically
begin to fetch the selected slides and readouts from the database.

2.3.1 Processing of raw signal Rmiracle offers data analysis in
several steps (Fig. 4):

o A heatmap for visual inspection and correction of block
shifts (Supplementary Fig. S3).

0 Positive control spots can be used to correct for uneven
staining using the method proposed by Neeley et al. (2012).

o If a dilution series has been spotted, a quantiﬁcation method
can be selected for merging these samples. Rmiracle cur-
rently supports SuperCurve, as well as implementations of
a logistic model (Tabus et al., 2006), serial dilution curve
(Zhang et al., 2009) and a non-parametric model (Hu
et al., 2007).

o Slides can be normalized for total protein amount by select-
ing between median loading, variable slope (Neeley et al.,
2009) or housekeeping normalization. For the latter, one or
several of the slides have to be marked as loading controls.

0 Signiﬁcance of relative sample differences can be assessed by
selecting a sample reference for performing Dunnett’s test
(Hothorn et al., 2008).

2.3.2 Protein concentration estimates and sample grouping With
the above settings, Rmiracle computes protein concentration
estimates that allow assessment of relative differences between
samples. To this end, we grasp back to the multi-layer sample
information model of MIRACLE to group samples. Users can
select horizontal and vertical grouping categories, for example
cell-lines tested or treatments applied, which will then be reﬂected
by different facets of a bar plot. Users can also select an add-
itional category called ‘ﬁll’ for separating bars by colour to
achieve a third grouping dimension to compare, for instance,
replicates with different numbers of depositions. The results are
also shown in tabular form, including a download option, and
are further accompanied by diagnostic plots speciﬁc for the
selected quantiﬁcation method. Figure 5 depicts the user inter-
face of the Rmiracle analysis. Beyond data visualization and
computation of protein concentration estimates, the analysis
comprises additional features introduced below.

Fig. 4. Processing of raw data in Rmiracle: Signal intensities are dis-
played in heatmaps (A) for visual inspection. Subsequently, a surface
adjustment based on control spots may be performed to correct for
uneven staining (B). In case of serial sample dilutions, quantiﬁcation
can be applied (C) to obtain a single protein concentration estimate
(D). Furthermore, data can be normalized to negative controls
(A_NC1) and total protein amount, e.g. using protein data from separate
slides, which enables the identiﬁcation of effector samples (E, depicted
by arrows). Signiﬁcance of the sample differences is ﬁnally assessed
in comparison to a selected negative control by applying Dunnett’s test

(F)

2.3.3 Comparison across slides and readouts The comparison
tab provides a bar plot (Fig. SF), in which an average is calcu-
lated for the previously selected colour ﬁll category, since colours
are here reserved for comparing protein concentration estimates
across slides. It is also possible to include plate readouts.

2.3.4 Correlation An important aspect of quality control is
signal correlation. In the correlation tab (Fig. 5G), all pairwise
Pearson correlation coefﬁcients are calculated for both, protein
concentration estimates and raw signal intensities, and presented
as a heatmap. Correlation is also shown between slides and plate
readouts. This can be an important factor, e.g. in case a plate-
based readout provides information about the total protein
amount and should therefore correlate with the RPPA signal
used for normalization.

Fig. 5. Analysis using Rmiracle: A heatmap visualizes different slide properties, such as signal intensities (A). Users can change various parameters, for
example inclusion of surface adjustment, selection of methods for quantiﬁcation and normalization for total protein amounts. Speciﬁc samples can be
selected and grouped based on different properties of the data set (B). Depending on the quantiﬁcation method, diagnostic plots are shown (C). The
results are displayed in an interactive table and in a bar plot (D and E). A global overview of protein concentration estimates is available for all slides and
plate-based readouts (F). Pearson correlation coefﬁcients are calculated for all slides, as well as for plate-based readouts (G). Signiﬁcance is assessed by

comparing sample groups to negative controls through Dunnett’s test (I-D

2.3.5 Signiﬁcance The signiﬁcance of relative differences be-
tween samples or between samples and a control is of great inter-
est for experimental researchers. Traditionally, t-tests are used to
obtain the necessary P-values, often neglecting multiple compari-
sons correction and issues arising from low replicate numbers. To
address these issues, MIRACLE applies Dunnett’s test (Fig. 5H),
which is a t-statistic based multiple comparison method compar-
ing each sample with a pre-deﬁned control. In contrast to other
methods, the variance is pooled across all samples, thereby
dealing with low replicate numbers (Hothorn et al., 2008).

2.3.6 Import and export Convenient import functions allow
experienced R users to download RPPA data directly from
MIRACLE by specifying ids or barcodes, respectively. R meth-
ods to process or visualize these data are directly available,
allowing data analysts to perform deeper analysis not covered
by the proposed work-ﬂow. Each slide, as well as the resulting
protein concentration estimates can be downloaded as tab- or
comma-separated ﬁle, in which all layout information is
included.

MIRACLE was built using Grails (http://grails.org/), a Groovy/
Java based web application framework that allows for rapid de-
velopment with a convention over conﬁguration approach.
Grails provides web application critical functionality through
industry-proven projects and plug-ins. This includes, for
instance, Hibernate for abstracting data access by modelling
database tables through java classes and Apache Lucene
(http://lucene.apache.org/core/) for efﬁcient database search.
Using hibernate allows MIRACLE to operate with any JDBC
compatible SQL database, such as Microsoft ® SQL Server or
Oracle ® MySQL. Data export to R is realized through a web
service, in which efﬁcient conversion between database content
and JSON objects is facilitated using Jackson (https://github.
com/FasterXML/jackson). Furthermore, the SpringSecurity pro-
ject (http://projects.spring.io/spring—security/) limits access with a
role-based user model. In case data should be accessible to users
without an account, MIRACLE provides an alternative access

model through universal unique identiﬁers called security tokens.
These are generated automatically for each slide and plate read-
out. In the current version (v. 0.8), all data are accessible to all
users. With the next release, we will change this such that data
are private for each user unless selected otherwise. To efﬁciently
deal with large image ﬁles in MIRACLE, we created the Grails
OpenSeaDragon plug-in (http://grails.org/plugin/open-seadra—
gon) for generating and displaying pyramide representations of
slide images in the Microsoft ® deep zoom format.

3.2 Rmiracle R package

All R functions have been wrapped in the R open-source pack-
age Rmiracle. This includes user and security token based
authentication for downloading data from MIRACLE, methods
for RPPA data processing, e.g. surface adjustment, various
methods for quantiﬁcation and normalization, as well as meth-
ods for visualization and statistical analysis using functionality
implemented in the R package multcomp.

In addition, all of these features are accessible through two
web applications developed directly on top of R utilizing Shiny
(http://www.rstudio.com/shiny/). Both Shiny applications are
included in the Rmiracle package and can be used independent
of MIRACLE via uploading ﬁles in a MIRACLE compliant
format (see Suppl. File 1 for an example).

4 DISCUSSION

RPPAs are a promising technology that ﬁnds growing applica-
tion in both, basic and clinical research. While many of the chal-
lenges of this technology are similar to those of traditional
microarrays, RPPA-speciﬁc challenges arise and have to be
addressed. In our efforts to adapt this technology as secondary
readout to high throughput genome-wide RNAi screens,
we identiﬁed a lack of a comprehensive tool incorporating all
necessary tasks, such as experimental design, sample tracking
and data analysis. To ﬁll this gap, we developed MIRACLE, a
web-based tool with deep integration of R for efﬁcient data
analysis.

Using a database-driven web application, such as MIRACLE,
for sample management offers a number of advantages. Due to
relational tables, all data are kept in a concise and consistent
format, where changes and updates are automatically propa-
gated. In contrast to ﬁle-based storage solutions, no experimental
information is lost upon turnover of laboratory staff and no
problems arise from cryptic and inconsistent sample termin-
ology. Collaboratively creating experimental data is signiﬁcantly
more convenient in web-based applications, as concurrency
issues, such as ﬁle locks, can be avoided. In addition, all infor-
mation can be located quickly, using full text search, which add-
itionally increases efﬁciency.

With regards to sample management, both the SuperCurve
package and RIMS provide a graphical user interface for spe-
cifying slide layouts, but it does not address sample tracking
from plate to slide level and does not allow for multiple levels
of sample information. Moreover, they lack the virtual spotting
and layout editing features of MIRACLE that enable researchers
to enter all sample-related information already on the plate level

and before the complexity of the layout is increased by the array
generation. This saves a signiﬁcant amount of time and effect-
ively avoids mistakes due to manual data processing.

The R packages SuperCurve and RPPanalyzer provide experi-
enced R users with a wealth of options to analyse RPPA data.
The results of these methods are relative protein concentration
estimates. A logical next step could be to investigate how signiﬁ-
cant relative differences in protein levels are and how well results
correlate, e.g. between slides used for normalization or between
individual slides and plate-based readout. Only RPPanalyzer
reports on slide to slide correlation (Mannsperger et al.,
2010a). Signiﬁcance analysis is not part of any existing solution.
Moreover, replicates are typically merged during data processing
to increase conﬁdence of the results, but thereby making them
unavailable for subsequent signiﬁcance analysis. In contrast,
Rmiracle processes replicates individually and offers a compre-
hensive evaluation of signiﬁcance and correlation. A number of
analysis methods, such as serial dilution curve (Zhang et al.,
2009) have been published as R code, but have not been adapted
to a user-friendly format, thereby limiting their application for
experimental researchers. Experienced R users, on the other
hand, need the ﬂexibility of the R environment to perform
deeper analysis of the data. Rmiracle strives to serve both
target groups by incorporating a broad number of published
methods on RPPA data analysis in both, command line and
web interface. Additionally, Rmiracle can be used completely
independently of the MIRACLE web application, requiring
only a local installation of R.

Notably, the web application RIMS followed similar goals as
MIRACLE, but did not include scenarios where more sophisti-
cated data processing, e.g. quantiﬁcation and normalization of
the signal intensities, is necessary (Neeley et al., 2009). Moreover,
RIMS is not actively developed or available at the moment,
stressing the need for a solution like MIRACLE.

4.1 Outlook

While MIRACLE has been designed to handle RPPA data, the
sample tracking issues addressed here are in general common for
researchers constructing customized microarrays, allowing adap-
tion of MIRACLE to serve other array formats.

RPPA data are particularly suited for unraveling complex pro-
tein signaling mechanisms. Therefore, we plan to integrate
MIRACLE with suitable tools for network and pathway
analysis.

The minimum information about a micorarray experiment
(MIAME) standard (Brazma et al., 2001) and platforms like
the gene expression omnibus (GEO) (Edgar et al., 2002) offer
an effective method for standardized data exchange of gene
expression array data. In GEO, users can export data to R or
utilize a web-based application called GE02R (https://www.ncbi.
n1m.nih.gov/geo/geo2r/) for basic analysis.

MIRACLE has the potential to deliver similar features to the
RPPA community. We therefore intend to continue development
towards an RPPA web portal for published data. In addition, we
envision that MIRACLE could serve as a framework for
comparing the performance of various methods for RPPA data
processing.

5 CONCLUSION

In recent years, the application of RPPA technology has matured
considerably. Along with this progress, suitable computational
methods have been developed to address issues in data process-
ing. To further promote acceptance of this technology, fully inte-
grated tools like MIRACLE are indispensable. Furthermore, it
can be expected that standardization of RPPA data in a common
framework can substantially aid the development of novel
algorithms and allow better integration at the level of network
biology and other multi-OMICS data. It is our hope that
MIRACLE will attract contributions from both, users and
developers, which will help to strengthen the entire ﬁeld. To
this end, we have established a github repository (https://
github.com/NanoCAN/MIRACLE) and established a demo
application (http://www.nanocan.org/miracle/demo) containing
biological sample data. Further documentation and a step-
by—step user guide are available online (Supplementary File 2).
